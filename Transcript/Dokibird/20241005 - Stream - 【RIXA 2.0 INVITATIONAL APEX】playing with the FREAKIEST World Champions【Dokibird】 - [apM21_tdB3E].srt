1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
All right, chat, we're waiting for the lobby code, which we just got.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,960
Now we're not waiting for it anymore.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,920
We got the code.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,000
The code's up.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,340
Like just in time.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,520
Oh my God.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,100
Sorry, chat.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,920
My YouTube was bugging out and it wouldn't let me stream for like 20 years.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,580
I sound dead inside just because I'm sick.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,320
Unlucky is also sick.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,980
So we are counting on Effect to carry both of us.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,360
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,360
Yes, sir.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,340
Yep.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,160
And if he doesn't...

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,500
Too many excuses.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,600
We didn't even start playing.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,060
And if he doesn't carry us, we're going to...

19
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,500
Unlucky's going to go to where he lives and burn his MVP medal.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,600
Hold on, what?

21
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,040
Yeah.

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,860
Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,780
We didn't talk about that one.

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,080
Well, we did.

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,380
We were like, if he doesn't carry, we're going to take away his MVP if he doesn't carry.

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,520
What about a burning medal?

27
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:00,660
A burning part.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,140
Oh, you're not going to burn it?

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,540
Okay, you're right.

30
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,220
We should sell it.

31
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,460
You're right.

32
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,980
There's more money to selling it.

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,640
Unlucky's going to go to where he lives and then take his MVP medal and sell it.

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,000
That's crazy.

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,120
That's called life, Unlucky.

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,820
Oh, damn.

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,280
All right.

38
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,160
He's got to learn.

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,880
I love stealing anyways.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,960
It's not stealing.

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
It's called revoking.

42
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,680
Yes.

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,000
Welcome, Effect, and Unlucky.

44
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:44,040
For those who don't know who they are, they are part of Alliance, which is who won the world champions for esports, for Apex Legends.

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,760
And they are, yeah, they're gamer gamers.

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,140
And now they're here to win $100.

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,940
Let's go.

48
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,600
To try.

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,460
To try.

50
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,540
To try to win $100.

51
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,240
Let's go.

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,800
Let's fucking go.

53
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,280
That'd be a good try.

54
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,700
All right.

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,300
Anyway, none of them are the IGLs of Alliance and I'm not an IGL either.

56
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,980
So who's IGLing for this team?

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,500
I'm going to be like duo doing this.

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,080
Duo, duo thing, you know?

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
Oh, a duo GL?

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,620
Yeah.

61
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,200
Okay.

62
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,700
Okay.

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,460
I believe in you guys.

64
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,060
Because I don't believe in me, so I have to believe in you guys.

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm pushing through this sickness right now.

66
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,580
I'm trying my best to like not die inside.

67
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,080
I'll send you.

68
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,300
I'm blind, bro.

69
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:42,700
You got it?

70
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,120
Yeah, I found it.

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,180
Yo, what are we playing right now?

72
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,260
Oh yeah, what are we playing?

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
That is such a good question.

74
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,580
Is there anything banned or something?

75
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,620
No, no, we can play whatever comp we want.

76
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,920
Yeah.

77
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,160
What do you like to play?

78
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,520
What Legends?

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,180
I can play anything but Valk.

80
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,600
I hate Valk.

81
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,160
Okay.

82
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,860
Uh...

83
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,860
Uh...

84
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,920
Shit.

85
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,440
Let's play Bang...

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,040
Bang Path.

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,280
What do you want to play?

88
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,760
Bang Path?

89
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,860
Yeah, I guess I'm buying you Path.

90
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,920
And then you can play whatever you want.

91
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,780
Oh, I can play whatever.

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,040
But what is whatever?

93
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,900
What's the most ideal with being in Path?

94
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,200
Guys!

95
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,600
How many years do you have in Apex Legends, guys?

96
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,380
Two days.

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:37,980
I don't know.

98
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm new to this game, guys.

99
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,780
Yeah, I don't know.

100
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,020
I mean, you can play whatever you want.

101
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,420
You can...

102
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,260
Whatever you want.

103
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,460
You can switch up a little bit every game if you want.

104
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,120
No, I don't want free will.

105
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:49,620
I...

106
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,860
We go random Legends every game.

107
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,620
Oh my God.

108
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,140
Random Legends every...

109
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,420
What's the most ideal?

110
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,420
We close our eyes and then we just go with the mouse.

111
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,860
Okay, all right.

112
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,860
I swear, we lose our first game because we...

113
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,380
I swear to God.

114
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,640
We lose our first game because I was on Valk because I closed my eyes.

115
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,560
I swear.

116
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,780
I swear.

117
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,200
I swear to God.

118
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,280
That's fine.

119
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,660
Okay, we're going to do Mystery Heroes.

120
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,260
All right.

121
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,280
Put it on the wheel.

122
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,420
All right.

123
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,080
We'll see what I get.

124
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,020
Oh, wait.

125
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,000
I could try...

126
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,740
I could try...

127
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,720
Is it Newcastle meta?

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,120
Yeah.

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,340
Yeah.

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,760
You want to play Newcastle?

132
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,120
Yeah, I can play Newcastle.

133
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,160
All right.

134
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,360
Sure.

135
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,760
Okay.

136
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,500
I can do it.

137
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,280
Guys, I'm not doing random fucking Mystery Heroes, guys.

138
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm not.

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:37,760
I'm not.

140
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,360
That's, like, a chance that I would accidentally pick Valkyrie, and I don't want that to happen.

141
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,540
It's fine.

142
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,060
I literally have, like, two games on Valk in my entire life on eBay.

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,860
I don't want to play Valk.

144
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,200
It's okay.

145
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,880
Keep it for last game.

146
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,440
That's true.

147
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,340
And we'll keep it for last game.

148
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,060
We're still not here.

149
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,980
They said 12-10 was a mandatory start.

150
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,780
They shouldn't...

151
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,100
They...

152
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,060
Shaking my head.

153
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,620
They should have started instantly.

154
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,720
Oh, my God.

155
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,700
What's the point of fucking deadlines if they're not even gonna start it?

156
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,360
Exactly, right?

157
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:13,800
Yeah.

158
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,560
I mean...

159
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Humans.

160
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,700
Can't believe it.

161
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,500
Not even gonna...

162
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,120
Not even gonna listen to their own rules.

163
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Shake my head.

164
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,140
Yeah, bro.

165
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,400
Also, guys, they're really tired because they're from EU.

166
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,320
So...

167
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,740
So, that's why they sound dead inside, just like...

168
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,900
I'm just dead inside because I'm sick.

169
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,360
Yeah, I feel like I would be not tired if I wasn't sick, to be honest.

170
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,480
True.

171
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,540
I think I'll be fine at 9 PM.

172
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,080
Yeah, they just got back from Japan.

173
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,560
So, I don't know why Unlucky...

174
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,520
In fact, didn't get sick, but Unlucky did.

175
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Oh, man.

176
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,140
I don't know.

177
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,560
I don't...

178
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
What did Unlucky do?

179
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:00,900
Hmm.

180
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,080
Oh, yeah.

181
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,580
I just...

182
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,020
You know?

183
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,400
Like...

184
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah?

185
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,720
Yeah.

186
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:08,940
I don't know.

187
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,660
No, but to be honest, bro.

188
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,140
You know there's so many people off the lines and all that stuff for their child to get sick, but I didn't really get sick.

189
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,120
He just has a stronger immune system.

190
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,740
I guess.

191
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,200
He's just Eastern European.

192
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,520
So, he's more...

193
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,600
I think...

194
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,900
He's built different.

195
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,420
Maybe.

196
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:25,780
Maybe.

197
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,200
I always get sick.

198
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,700
As soon as I leave my house, I'm sick.

199
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,300
Yeah, your immune system fucking sucks.

200
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,640
Not bad.

201
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,100
Not shit.

202
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,520
Bro, you gotta let...

203
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:37,720
You gotta let...

204
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,660
You have to go outside more so your immune system builds up a more tougher resilience against the weather.

205
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:45,980
Yeah.

206
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,600
I'm not that guy.

207
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,360
Oh, yeah.

208
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,780
You're right.

209
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,860
You're Apex, bro.

210
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,960
Yeah.

211
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,460
Yeah.

212
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,900
You have to stay inside.

213
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,920
I don't do outside.

214
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,600
Yeah.

215
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,920
It's true.

216
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,940
We're all terminally online.

217
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,480
Outside is too neat.

218
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,160
Yeah.

219
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,300
That's true.

220
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:58,800
That's true.

221
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,660
What?

222
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,080
Where did we get at for?

223
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,980
Running five minutes behind.

224
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,840
Oh, okay.

225
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,180
So, we're gonna start at 12.15 then.

226
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,700
Yeah.

227
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,280
Okay.

228
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,740
What the fuck?

229
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:08,900
Okay.

230
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,280
That's gone.

231
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,560
Oh, my God.

232
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,780
15 minutes late.

233
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,140
That's a lot.

234
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,520
This tournament.

235
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,340
After three minutes...

236
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,080
Three games, it's gonna be like 30 minutes.

237
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,360
What?

238
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,000
30-minute transition after three games to shout out the sponsors.

239
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,520
I can literally shout out the sponsors for them in fucking two minutes right now, but I won't because I'm not sponsored.

240
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,960
They don't get free shit from me.

241
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,700
They don't.

242
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,580
I don't understand why it's 30 minutes.

243
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
I don't understand.

244
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,340
It can be done in 10 to 15 minutes at best.

245
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,920
God.

246
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,420
Yeah.

247
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,360
That's a long ass time.

248
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,760
Yeah.

249
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,800
It's a long ass time.

250
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,180
What are we gonna do in 30 minutes?

251
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,780
Okay.

252
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,520
We're gonna just relax for 30 minutes and...

253
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,080
What the fuck are these team names?

254
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,600
A quick nap.

255
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,660
A quick nap.

256
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,940
A quick 30-minute nap, and then they never come back, so I have to play alone.

257
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,540
The last three minutes, I'm just on my own team.

258
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:16,940
Shit.

259
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,420
What the fuck is...

260
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,800
What the fuck is going on in the chat?

261
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,490
Our name is going to LAN.

262
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,990
If we win, we're going to LAN.

263
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,750
Yeah, we're going to LAN, guys.

264
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,370
Yeah, guys.

265
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,610
I don't know if you guys heard, but I'll be...

266
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,350
I'm signing up to Alliance.

267
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,910
That was my announcement.

268
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,790
I'll be Alliance's coach.

269
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,470
True, bro.

270
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,470
That's why Hakis isn't here.

271
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:49,970
Yup.

272
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,270
Yeah, man.

273
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,510
Our manager told us that we're getting dropped, and me and Unlucky are going to Japan.

274
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,910
Yeah, Hakis is getting dropped.

275
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:05,230
Me and Unlucky, in fact, are going to go to LAN from third place.

276
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,590
It's the 20th place right there.

277
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,010
Hakis who?

278
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:10,790
You're right.

279
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,150
Who?

280
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,370
Guys, we needed fresh new blood.

281
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,230
Huh?

282
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,290
New blood in the team Alliance.

283
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,750
I really...

284
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,190
Bro, Hakis is too old.

285
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,770
I didn't say that.

286
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:28,470
I...

287
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,110
You said new blood.

288
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,110
That's basically the same thing.

289
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,050
It could be anybody.

290
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,130
It could be anybody.

291
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,050
Yeah?

292
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:36,830
Yeah.

293
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,230
All right.

294
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,130
Who's the second oldest?

295
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,330
Unlucky.

296
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,130
He's like three months older than me.

297
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,130
Oh, shit.

298
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,630
Oh, yeah.

299
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,810
He's such a boomer.

300
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,690
Damn.

301
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,550
Three months older?

302
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,970
That's practically three fucking years.

303
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,570
God damn.

304
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,850
You might as well retire.

305
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,010
Oh, okay.

306
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,770
What the hell?

307
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,350
Oh, no.

308
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,650
No, yeah.

309
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:01,950
No, yeah.

310
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,470
When you hit that big 2-0.

311
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,210
Oh, man.

312
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:04,730
That's...

313
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,290
It's...

314
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:05,350
It's...

315
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,230
It's soon.

316
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,930
It's soon enough.

317
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,890
Three months.

318
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,790
The big 2-0.

319
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,950
That's when you know.

320
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,510
It might be me.

321
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,030
Wow.

322
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,190
Getting old.

323
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,230
Don't worry.

324
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,110
I believe in us.

325
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,110
I don't.

326
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,670
Let's go.

327
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,430
What?

328
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,350
Why don't you believe anymore?

329
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,030
I'm shocked.

330
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,330
It's because his birthday is coming up.

331
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,750
So, now he stopped believing.

332
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,670
Yeah.

333
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,330
Yeah.

334
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,690
It's okay.

335
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,210
We all get old, guys.

336
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,870
Even though when you've turned 20, you still have a lot ahead of you.

337
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,310
I don't know about that one.

338
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,330
What?

339
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,870
Retirement angle.

340
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,070
What the fuck?

341
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,190
What?

342
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,790
You're not going to retire at 20?

343
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,390
I am.

344
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,730
You'll see.

345
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,770
Oh, okay.

346
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,070
Okay.

347
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,370
Wait.

348
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,410
When are you turning 20?

349
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,250
Three months.

350
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:05,330
Three months.

351
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,090
Oh, in three...

352
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,570
Okay, guys.

353
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,270
Let's have a countdown.

354
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:07,850
Let's...

355
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,130
Have a countdown.

356
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,310
Three months.

357
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,690
Like, one month before Japan, he just fucking... he's gone.

358
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,870
He disappears.

359
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,350
He goes off the grid.

360
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,030
We're winning champs and then I'm gone.

361
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,530
Yeah.

362
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,290
He's like, this is it.

363
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,590
And then off the grid.

364
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:25,610
No.

365
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,410
Stay in Japan.

366
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,450
Okay.

367
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,970
You're going to...

368
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,510
You're going to legally stay in Japan.

369
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,230
No.

370
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,210
It's going to be a...

371
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,330
It's going to be a...

372
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,310
Legal tourist there.

373
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,130
Oh my God.

374
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,330
Oh my God.

375
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,550
This is the sick team.

376
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,310
It's okay.

377
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,510
Guys, for those who don't know, Effect and... both Effect and Unlucky are on rollers.

378
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,790
So like, even when sick, they play just as good as a mouse and keyboard player.

379
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,890
Okay.

380
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,130
What?

381
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,130
Yeah.

382
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,450
It's true.

383
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:03,670
Yeah.

384
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,750
Okay.

385
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:04,810
Okay.

386
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,330
Okay.

387
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,650
Just when you're sick, when you're not sick, you play even better than the MNK players.

388
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,210
That's how it goes.

389
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:19,670
Yeah.

390
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,130
Ugh.

391
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:21,790
I can't breathe.

392
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,030
It's okay.

393
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,450
Me too.

394
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,190
I have like a tissue box right next to me.

395
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,070
Ew.

396
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,290
But you're MNK and also sick.

397
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:35,510
Yes.

398
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:43,470
So I play just as bad as everybody else, but it's okay.

399
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,450
We're here to have fun and not be last place.

400
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:47,530
Yeah, we are.

401
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,770
Where are we landing by the way?

402
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,550
Shipyard.

403
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,330
Shipyard.

404
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:52,670
Shipyard.

405
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,330
Oh my gosh.

406
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,570
Good question.

407
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:54,950
Shit.

408
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,670
Where even is that?

409
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,410
It's at the bottom.

410
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,430
Shipyard Arcade.

411
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,010
It's at the very bottom.

412
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,030
Okay.

413
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,650
I'll send you the map thingy.

414
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:04,650
Where?

415
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,070
Okay.

416
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,490
Okay.

417
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,770
This is where our first landing spot is.

418
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,810
And then our second one is Devastated Coast.

419
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,030
Devastated Coast?

420
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,770
Yeah.

421
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,150
Yeah.

422
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,670
Yeah.

423
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:17,870
Yeah.

424
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,490
Yeah.

425
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:20,930
Yeah.

426
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,130
We literally got 19th pick for drops.

427
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,110
So I was like, I don't care.

428
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,530
Just roll.

429
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,330
It's not that bad.

430
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:29,650
It's okay.

431
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,770
I was like, just roll for it.

432
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,910
Like, I don't fucking care.

433
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,790
We have two shitty drops left.

434
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,290
Okay.

435
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,390
Please not be first pick because I don't know where Newcastle is.

436
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,050
There he is.

437
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,780
Okay.

438
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,800
Here we go.

439
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,460
First game.

440
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,580
First game on.

441
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,940
Going to be so much fun, guys.

442
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,500
Yeah.

443
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:51,580
Bye.

444
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,120
Bye.

445
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,400
I can feel the hype from the fact he's like...

446
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,220
Let's go, baby.

447
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,300
Let's go.

448
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,100
Where's the hype?

449
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm locked.

450
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,460
He's just locked in.

451
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,840
Look at that.

452
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,040
Look at our beautiful bat.

453
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,760
Oh, shit.

454
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,040
Oh, he got the code.

455
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,660
It's real.

456
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,560
It's real?

457
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,620
Let's go.

458
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,100
Oh, shit.

459
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,940
Oh, I'm going to go left.

460
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,440
I'm going to go loot here, okay?

461
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,100
Let's not loot here.

462
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,480
How do I loot this place?

463
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,140
How do I even loot this area?

464
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,640
I'll loot the middle, I guess.

465
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,300
I'll loot the middle.

466
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,700
Yeah.

467
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,680
I'm just so confused looking at this.

468
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,280
I see.

469
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,920
Don't worry about it.

470
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,700
Okay.

471
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,720
This is an East Coast server.

472
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,620
That's good for you guys.

473
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,440
180 ping.

474
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:41,980
Oh.

475
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,500
Yeah.

476
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,220
180 ping.

477
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,100
Let's go, free.

478
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,120
That's best.

479
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,760
No.

480
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,660
No.

481
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,080
No.

482
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,020
This is better than 200!

483
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,740
Okay, the door just closed again after I opened it.

484
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,240
Oh my god, I'm a fucking mess.

485
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,900
I'm like, not looting properly.

486
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,860
It's okay.

487
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,540
First game on.

488
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,680
First game, yeah yeah, first game warm up.

489
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,460
I agree.

490
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,440
I have flatline and eva 8.

491
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,700
Yeah, the zone is closed.

492
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,040
That's the thing.

493
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,800
Nice.

494
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,620
I believe.

495
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,800
Alright guys, where is end zone?

496
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,980
No idea.

497
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Oh.

498
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,800
Give a lucky guess.

499
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,900
With all your experience.

500
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,660
All the way back there?

501
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,360
Okay.

502
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,760
Also guys, what do I get?

503
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,140
Swift shield or thick shield?

504
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,400
I think thick shield.

505
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,340
I think so too.

506
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,440
Which one?

507
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,520
Thick.

508
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,480
Thick?

509
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,700
Okay.

510
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Yeah yeah.

511
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,640
Okay, thick shield.

512
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,460
I need a second Mozambique.

513
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,140
Oh, I got one for you.

514
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,200
You can have mine.

515
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,300
Really?

516
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:01,840
Yeah.

517
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,740
Yeah, I'll give the roller player the second Mozamb.

518
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,160
Very nice.

519
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,260
Very nice of you.

520
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,820
Yeah.

521
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,620
Oh, I already found another one anyway.

522
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
It's a massive I think.

523
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,040
Okay, I'm on my way.

524
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,660
I'm going to get the beak and I'm going to scan.

525
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,060
Alright.

526
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,020
Beacon.

527
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,300
Where's the knockdown shield?

528
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,660
Oh, there it is.

529
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll use that.

530
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,800
Oh.

531
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,540
I'm scanning.

532
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,480
I'm being quick.

533
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,380
It's a lock brush.

534
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh my god, you guys got it correct.

535
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,980
More like a him, him, him correct.

536
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,620
Oh my god.

537
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,640
Let's go.

538
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,920
It's called being three months younger.

539
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,060
I'm going to do it.

540
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,280
It's still pretty good.

541
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:02,740
Yeah.

542
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,360
It's his reflexes.

543
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,660
His intuition is still prime.

544
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,080
Oh my god.

545
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
We got no UV.

546
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,580
Actually, I just thought about it.

547
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,000
I already got...

548
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,160
People are already fighting?

549
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,660
Damn.

550
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,980
There might be a team still here.

551
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,500
Yeah.

552
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,480
We gotta watch out.

553
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:23,960
Yeah.

554
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,060
I don't know how fast they're looting.

555
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,800
It's okay.

556
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,400
So, yeah.

557
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,400
You guys are in front of me.

558
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,520
So, I believe...

559
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,350
Oh.

560
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,550
I'll need that.

561
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,590
I only got one bat.

562
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,830
I can give you...

563
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,130
Oh.

564
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,510
I can give you one too.

565
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:44,610
Yeah.

566
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:44,970
I can give you one.

567
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,470
Here.

568
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,910
I have three as well.

569
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,810
Let's keep going.

570
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,370
Ah.

571
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:51,690
My eyes.

572
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,070
My eyes are burning.

573
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,570
I love hearing that your eyes are burning.

574
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,050
Oh my god.

575
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,690
My...

576
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,510
My hope in us gets higher.

577
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,350
Whoa.

578
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,050
I don't have long range.

579
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,130
We can just go left.

580
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,370
And take that bin too.

581
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,630
Alright.

582
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,390
But I've never been there.

583
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,270
On the left.

584
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,850
I haven't...

585
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,530
I didn't...

586
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,730
You guys have never been to the left side before?

587
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,030
Nope.

588
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,970
The ballooning.

589
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:22,510
We can shoot it.

590
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,230
Do we shoot it?

591
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:25,370
Yeah.

592
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,470
The people on it.

593
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,590
I'll shoot it with my little bolt.

594
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,170
That balloon was deeper than I actually thought it was.

595
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,110
What the fuck?

596
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:38,950
Alright.

597
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,190
What's in that little...

598
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,010
Do you want to play for a zone here or no?

599
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,190
Maybe I should try to get in.

600
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,210
Miron.

601
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,350
Miron.

602
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,730
Do you want to play for a beacon?

603
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,010
Miron.

604
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,810
Miron.

605
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,410
We can go there.

606
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:52,590
They go there bro.

607
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,990
There goes Point Kill.

608
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:54,890
Alright.

609
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,450
Calm.

610
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,450
Is there any balloon here?

611
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,990
Well, there's a helmet here.

612
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,650
I'll take that.

613
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,910
I think there is actually.

614
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,730
I believe in your IGL...

615
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,230
Dual GLs.

616
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,770
I listen.

617
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,530
That's wrong.

618
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:09,810
Ugh.

619
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,550
I shouldn't believe that.

620
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,370
It's going to go miserable.

621
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:12,770
Okay.

622
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:12,990
Look.

623
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,030
Like we're obviously not going to listen to me.

624
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,590
I have at least to explain it.

625
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,430
What do I do if my...

626
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,010
Both my dual GLs are a rock?

627
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,090
I'm crying.

628
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,750
Fucking choc die.

629
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,030
I really want this cash there actually.

630
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,070
I need like more energy.

631
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,790
Oh there it is.

632
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,790
I need more energy.

633
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,010
If you guys see nemesis let me know because I don't have a long range.

634
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,070
We're good by the way.

635
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,490
I don't see anything.

636
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,110
Okay.

637
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,370
Oh I'm by myself.

638
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,630
I feel scared.

639
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,410
Me too.

640
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,390
It's so quiet.

641
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,970
It really is.

642
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,030
It's all by ourselves.

643
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,990
I got that quick?

644
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,630
Oh my god.

645
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,730
Let's go back.

646
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,150
Let's go back.

647
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,090
Alright.

648
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,110
We might as well take that bin too.

649
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,070
Should we flee the bin that's not taken?

650
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,570
Maybe yeah.

651
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,370
Actually yeah.

652
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,050
Behind us.

653
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,730
Behind us?

654
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,050
No I was just looking.

655
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:30,510
Oh okay.

656
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,770
Oh my god don't... saying that made me scared.

657
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,410
It's fine.

658
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:35,810
I'm sorry.

659
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,670
I'm super skittish.

660
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:39,670
It's good.

661
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,170
People... oh!

662
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,090
People to our right.

663
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,990
There's so many stars.

664
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,950
I love... I hate this map.

665
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,490
We could have been playing on World's Edge guys.

666
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,770
Hahaha.

667
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,230
Hahaha.

668
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,390
Oh it's the probably.

669
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:54,790
Woah.

670
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:55,650
Shit.

671
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,310
Fuck I almost cracked.

672
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,530
Smoke out.

673
00:20:59,210 --> 00:20:59,750
Yeah yeah.

674
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,510
No signal.

675
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,490
The long way right.

676
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,870
The shield is slowly moving.

677
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,090
We can go here.

678
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,530
Oh nice nemesis.

679
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:08,650
I'm on guys far right.

680
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,070
Yeah we can get inside.

681
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,490
Yeah yeah I'm inside.

682
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:10,910
Nice.

683
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,090
I got my nemesis right here.

684
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:12,570
Use your dab.

685
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,490
Yeah yeah.

686
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,650
Give me my shield.

687
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,010
Heh.

688
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,770
Wanna play this building or the other one?

689
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,250
Um.

690
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,490
I think this one.

691
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,410
There's a golden bolt in that bin.

692
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,510
Okay.

693
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,030
I'm gonna go.

694
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,510
I just have four cells.

695
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,270
I dropped my own.

696
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,910
Oh I can give you some cells here.

697
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,150
So what's the team though right?

698
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:30,510
That's.

699
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,870
Oh wait there's two cells literally right here.

700
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,350
Hahaha.

701
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:34,750
Haha.

702
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,470
That's a Valk team there.

703
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,150
Huh.

704
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,470
Okay what do I.

705
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,150
Did I get stronghold or miracle worker?

706
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,930
Sponsoon is building in front of us I think.

707
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,570
What did you say?

708
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,410
Miracle worker or stronghold?

709
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,750
I think.

710
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,530
The one where it's like energized.

711
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,410
I don't know how it's called.

712
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,010
Energized.

713
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,350
Energized.

714
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,090
Okay I got it.

715
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,370
Yeah yeah yeah.

716
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:55,970
Stronghold.

717
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:57,790
Yeah.

718
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,390
That's good.

719
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,890
Okay stay here for now.

720
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,350
I'm gonna go.

721
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,950
I mean we can hold off.

722
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:02,910
Both?

723
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,990
Okay I'll stay here then.

724
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,990
Team flying.

725
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,730
I think we should watch our back.

726
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,450
Okay.

727
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,870
Team flight.

728
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,390
That's fine.

729
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,410
We're gonna land up here somewhere.

730
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,730
Yeah yeah.

731
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,910
I'm gonna try to hold our back a little bit as well at the same time.

732
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,330
Okay I'll look in front of us then.

733
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,430
God they have such high high ground.

734
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,070
Oh there's a team inside this house.

735
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,050
Yeah.

736
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,490
Pretty much everyone.

737
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:27,990
Everywhere.

738
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,350
Okay I'm just gonna play stairs and hold back until it's closing.

739
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,710
Okay.

740
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,610
Okay.

741
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,130
Sorry I'm on actual mistake on- oh it's not on.

742
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,690
Oh yeah non-miss mode isn't on.

743
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,210
Yeah it's fine.

744
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:46,990
That's fine.

745
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,630
We don't care.

746
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,360
We don't care.

747
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,800
We don't care.

748
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:52,980
Okay.

749
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,800
It's okay.

750
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,300
Alright guys this is the best part about competitive guys we do nothing.

751
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,700
We're like two zones.

752
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,960
Love it.

753
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,740
We literally just hang out cause there's 200 buildings here.

754
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,760
Yup.

755
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,120
So nothing dies.

756
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,050
I love Apex.

757
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:19,730
Yup.

758
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,430
We love Apex.

759
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,190
We love Apex.

760
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,070
Guys don't worry in the last zone that's when things start colliding.

761
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,530
I love Apex.

762
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,530
Yep.

763
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,330
I think I got him really quick.

764
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:27,610
Can I pick him up now real quick.

765
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,550
Oh I should die on him.

766
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,830
Hopefully I will cobble the end game.

767
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,270
I can't wait.

768
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,030
Oh somebody has a Sheela.

769
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,370
Hm.

770
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,510
Wait that's a Sheela or a Vantage?

771
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,370
I can't tell.

772
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:40,870
Yeah it's Sheela.

773
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,490
Okay.

774
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,630
It could be both.

775
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,250
I'm thinking I'll play Vantage.

776
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,850
Someone in my chat is like unlucky is so handsome.

777
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:50,210
How- you don't- I'm not- you're not even watching his stream.

778
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,790
You're watching..

779
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,510
How would you know?

780
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,090
What the hell?

781
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,510
It's down to the last one.

782
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,510
You messed up.

783
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,230
His name is Keanu Weebs.

784
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,350
He's literally a fucking icon on my screen, like how can he be?

785
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,990
He's like, there's this guy looking at me.

786
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,090
Yo, what if I hit your ring console dude?

787
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,770
Yeah bro, go for it.

788
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,010
You gonna hit it?

789
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,710
Yeah, I'll smoke you, don't worry.

790
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,610
Okay.

791
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,410
I don't want to shoot too much, because I have limited ammo.

792
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,930
You don't have to have triple armor, it's fine.

793
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,110
Yeah, we're fine.

794
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,950
They're playing out here bro, they're not even holding the building.

795
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,490
We could literally zip on top and fuck them up.

796
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,310
Can we actually?

797
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,730
I don't know how many people have angles on this.

798
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,050
Yeah, we don't have angles.

799
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,130
I'm like, are you sure?

800
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,270
Yeah, I'm like, are you sure?

801
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,070
Okay, they're...

802
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,230
We're not in zone though.

803
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,790
Can we just take a floor now?

804
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,970
Take a floor?

805
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,330
Okay.

806
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:06,910
Which side, the frame yours?

807
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,510
I think it's your side better, no?

808
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,490
It's the balcony side.

809
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:11,850
Is this?

810
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,930
Oh, it's this, okay.

811
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,590
Just play up, go baby.

812
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,430
Going, going, going, going.

813
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,570
Bangalore, rampart.

814
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,690
Oh, they walled it up.

815
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,170
We can see proof.

816
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,790
Let's see proof.

817
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,090
Yeah, come, come, come, come, come.

818
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,510
Here I am.

819
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,470
I'm gonna come up though, right now.

820
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,530
Wall cracked.

821
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,430
I'm going here.

822
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,050
Serious, serious, serious.

823
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,470
Oh shit, okay.

824
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:33,710
Goodbye.

825
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,290
Oh shit, I didn't realize we were committing.

826
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,710
Sorry, that was my bad.

827
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,910
I didn't know we were committing, I'm sorry.

828
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,650
I didn't hear the commit.

829
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,210
You can just craft maybe.

830
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,030
Okay.

831
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,230
Yeah, you can go out, yeah.

832
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,590
Okay.

833
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,830
That was my bad, I didn't realize you were committing to it.

834
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,650
I mean, don't worry, I committed first, I didn't know I'm not getting followed, right?

835
00:25:59,230 --> 00:25:59,670
Yeah.

836
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,650
I don't think I can, you can try to craft here but...

837
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,650
Yeah, I can craft, you guys.

838
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,730
I think.

839
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,030
I'm gonna craft.

840
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,710
Easy, doable.

841
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,170
Where's the crafter?

842
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,630
Where is it?

843
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,610
Oh, there it is.

844
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,270
I hear people next to me.

845
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,290
I'm a little scared.

846
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:16,430
I'm scared.

847
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,870
Yeah, I think you're getting chased.

848
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,990
Yeah, you chased me.

849
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,050
Yeah, you chased me, yeah.

850
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,710
Ah.

851
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,390
Beam up.

852
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,030
Jesus Christ.

853
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,670
Run.

854
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,290
No!

855
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:28,890
Oh!

856
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,470
No!

857
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,350
That is you!

858
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,390
I...

859
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,730
Oh my god.

860
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,470
That's fine.

861
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,090
That was my bad.

862
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,890
I didn't hear...

863
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,170
I didn't hear you were gonna commit to it, in fact.

864
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,510
Excuse me?

865
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,490
I didn't hear it, sorry.

866
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,270
Oh my god.

867
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,470
It's fine.

868
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,110
It's fine.

869
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,450
I'm gonna raise...

870
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,470
I'm lucky to lock in.

871
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,590
That's great.

872
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,070
I thought you were gonna peek stairs with me, bro.

873
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,030
She was leading one.

874
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,390
I was botting.

875
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,150
I was botting.

876
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,570
Oh, you got cracked when we go?

877
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,110
I went up the roof?

878
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,190
Yeah.

879
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,230
See, I'm gonna raise your volume, guys, a little higher.

880
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,130
Guys, it's the sick debuff, guys.

881
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:05,890
It's the sick...

882
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,190
Yeah, I feel like I'm getting sick, too, bro.

883
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,010
Just letting me sit with you.

884
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,310
It's really the sick debuff right now.

885
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,250
You kidding me?

886
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:16,770
He's sickness.

887
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,670
Oh, fuck.

888
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,270
Yeah, it's shocked out here.

889
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,630
Oh my god.

890
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,110
It's okay.

891
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,850
Warm up.

892
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,050
It's the warm up round.

893
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:27,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

894
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,350
This is the first game.

895
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:29,670
It's coming.

896
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,410
Bro, let's just push people.

897
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,210
Yeah, we can.

898
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,870
What do you think of that?

899
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,570
Yeah, let's do it.

900
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,490
Second game, we just push people.

901
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:37,850
Yeah.

902
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,410
Play Rev?

903
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,670
You're gonna play Rev?

904
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,230
Oh my god.

905
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,930
That Valkyr's died.

906
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,610
Shit.

907
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,430
He just died.

908
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,250
Holy shit.

909
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,270
I don't even know how he died.

910
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,850
Did I die to his teammates?

911
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,090
You died to enemy.

912
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,370
You died to enemy.

913
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,470
Not even.

914
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:56,690
I...

915
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,950
I died to Hazel, internet girl, in Ipt.

916
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,350
I saw you got shot by enemy, so I thought that's what happened.

917
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,930
I don't know.

918
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,290
You know, we could've fucking...

919
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,250
We probably should've zipped up and put walls.

920
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,390
Newcastle walls.

921
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:15,870
Yeah.

922
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:19,390
Reset and then fucking slide into the plant thing.

923
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,650
That would've been perfect.

924
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,750
Ah, man.

925
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,110
Too much thinking, Tor.

926
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,250
What's the rest of the game?

927
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,330
Yeah, it was more like standard angle, you know?

928
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,570
Yeah, we just...

929
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:34,070
I went up the fucking thingy, I saw you shot the gun, zip, and then I heard a guy under us on the stairs, I was like, yeah, I'm gonna surprise him.

930
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,770
I gave him like one...

931
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,330
He was literally one shot, by the way.

932
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,850
The Rambo was literally one shot.

933
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,890
Ah, that's unlucky.

934
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,830
Yeah, I told you guys a lot too.

935
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,470
So unlucky for unlucky.

936
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:43,890
Yeah.

937
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,250
Okay.

938
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:44,970
Yeah, lucky for me.

939
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,250
First game was shut down.

940
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:46,910
Just a warm up.

941
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,110
Second game, we know how people play now.

942
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,090
Just gonna int everyone.

943
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:52,530
It's fine.

944
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,750
Okay.

945
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,670
Wait, are we gonna...

946
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,210
So, should I still play Newcastle or should I play something else?

947
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,330
We're gonna int everybody.

948
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,130
What are you...

949
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,190
Thinking.

950
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,470
What do you wanna play?

951
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,790
Like, do you wanna play still bang or...

952
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,210
Mmm...

953
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,550
Play FRAF, actually.

954
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:13,490
Mmm...

955
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,530
Nothing else on bang.

956
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,150
Okay.

957
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,230
Okay.

958
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,860
Hmm, half point Gibby.

959
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,500
Ah.

960
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:23,800
No.

961
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,140
Wait, so what do I play?

962
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm thinking red, though.

963
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,340
Don't wanna poke bout, so...

964
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,460
Ahem.

965
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,640
But Newcastle is still fine, I think.

966
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,020
Newcastle is still fine?

967
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,300
Okay, I'll keep playing Newcastle.

968
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,560
I think it's still fine.

969
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,560
Yeah, guys.

970
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,620
It's just very lucky that this entire team is practically safe.

971
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,940
We made Effect sick as well.

972
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,520
We gave him the sickness.

973
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,860
We're all sad.

974
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,560
Alright.

975
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,240
No!

976
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,200
We couldn't live till end, so now we have to watch this.

977
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,600
Yup.

978
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,540
Alright guys, this is motivation.

979
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,540
We can't fuck up next game, so we don't have to watch people for 15 minutes.

980
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,280
It's the worst part because it's still early game.

981
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,900
So we have to wait so long.

982
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,260
We have to wait so long.

983
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Literally sick plays.

984
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,500
Oh, he's dead.

985
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,060
Unless...

986
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,300
He's still dead.

987
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,480
Why isn't this in a corner?

988
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,940
It's calm though.

989
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,460
Are you able to play pubs in between?

990
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,280
No, it's not ideal to play pubs in between right now.

991
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:58,680
No, it's not ideal to play pubs in between right now.

992
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:58,880
Cause...

993
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,080
Not really.

994
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,460
Yeah, not now.

995
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,140
We could, but...

996
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,000
We could, but...

997
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,400
We could, but...

998
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,560
Yeah...

999
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,900
Their warm up is killing real players in this lobby.

1000
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:18,580
Their warm up is killing real players in this lobby.

1001
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,500
Yeah.

1002
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,920
Alright guys.

1003
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,340
Alright guys.

1004
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,340
That's why we're gonna play different next game.

1005
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,320
Yeah, yeah.

1006
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,260
We know we're not a zone team now, so we'll play edge.

1007
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,100
Yeah, I'll go with the...

1008
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:32,860
UVA.

1009
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,400
I mean, like, the people...

1010
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,960
Bro, I'm gonna play Meggy.

1011
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,000
You're gonna play...

1012
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,900
You sure?

1013
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,840
Yeah.

1014
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,440
We could try, we can... What the fuck?

1015
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,580
What the fuck?

1016
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,840
I mean, it's literally one guy.

1017
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,540
I mean...

1018
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,220
Oh my god.

1019
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,840
They died so fast.

1020
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,780
What the fuck?

1021
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,190
Yeah.

1022
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,650
What a shield.

1023
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,010
Yup.

1024
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,340
Yeah, we're gonna be playing aggressive next game.

1025
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,200
Cause we're not...

1026
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,240
We're not a zone team.

1027
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,260
Like, we realized in that first game, we're like...

1028
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh yeah, we're...

1029
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,220
We can't play zone.

1030
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,440
We need warm up a little bit.

1031
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,540
Yeah, they need...

1032
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,800
They need warm up to get into the kill mode.

1033
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,700
I just need a...

1034
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,040
I just need to not be sick.

1035
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,820
Nothing's gonna change with me.

1036
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,140
Nothing's gonna change with me.

1037
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,780
It's okay.

1038
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,660
Oh my god, he went off the grid!

1039
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,740
Oh my god, he went off the grid!

1040
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,000
Wait, huh?

1041
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
He can't steal it cause someone is resing.

1042
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,110
Oh my god.

1043
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,590
Wait, they got the res though.

1044
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,550
Go off the grid!

1045
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,350
They won't know!

1046
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,810
They'll think it's one person.

1047
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,810
Oh!

1048
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,090
Oh!

1049
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:12,650
Oh!

1050
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,890
Okay, that...

1051
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,950
That's... oh... I think...

1052
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,770
Oh...

1053
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,410
Dragon...

1054
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,150
Dragon died to zone?

1055
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,930
No way.

1056
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,130
Guys, relax.

1057
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,630
People were like...

1058
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,970
Guys, people were criticizing my team for being too strong.

1059
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,090
But like, this team is like...

1060
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:37,990
Too strong too.

1061
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,530
Come on.

1062
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,890
One is a fucking coach.

1063
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,270
Two are also pro players.

1064
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:42,850
Like...

1065
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,030
I'm sick.

1066
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:46,990
Unlucky sick.

1067
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,650
Like, we're practically...

1068
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,830
We're playing nerfed out here.

1069
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,590
Yeah, we're playing nerfed as hard.

1070
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,740
It's been a rough day.

1071
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,600
Yeah, it's been a rough fucking week.

1072
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,660
It's been a...

1073
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,320
It's been a...

1074
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,340
It's been a...

1075
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,920
Shit, what the fuck is going up there?

1076
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,020
Lots of things.

1077
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,320
I would love to play Valak, but it's high ping and Valak is like kinda shit on high ping.

1078
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:15,960
It's high ping and Valak is like kinda shit on high ping.

1079
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,980
That's true.

1080
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,240
180 ping.

1081
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,420
Yeah.

1082
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
Cause you know, we're 7.

1083
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Maybe we can play Valak.

1084
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,580
Valak, Rampart, something else.

1085
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,080
Jesus Christ.

1086
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:27,640
Jesus Christ.

1087
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
Ah, dragon.

1088
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,240
It's alright, he's alive.

1089
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,000
This is what...

1090
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,380
This is what Vektor's gonna do, but even better.

1091
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,660
Cause he won't die like that.

1092
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,260
Yeah, they're dead.

1093
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,320
What the fuck?

1094
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
What the fuck is happening to the enemy, dude?

1095
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,560
I was like, what the fuck is going on?

1096
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,100
Holy shit.

1097
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,800
Oh, that's...

1098
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,900
Oh, okay, goodbye.

1099
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,220
We're jumping a lot.

1100
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,060
I couldn't even see what was going on.

1101
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,860
He was taking damage.

1102
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah.

1103
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,720
Oh man.

1104
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:05,980
Alright.

1105
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,360
Wing Flavors.

1106
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,060
Wingaria and Wing Beano just won.

1107
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,780
What the...

1108
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,580
Is this their names, actually?

1109
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,620
No, no, it's like...

1110
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,360
It's their nicknames.

1111
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,380
Okay.

1112
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,140
Ah, we go again.

1113
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,680
You wanna play Mega now?

1114
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,500
Yeah.

1115
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,160
Let's kill everyone.

1116
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,940
Just get all kill points.

1117
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,340
It doesn't matter what placement we are.

1118
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,240
As long as we get every kill point possible.

1119
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1120
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,140
That's basically it.

1121
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,340
Alright.

1122
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,740
We got this.

1123
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,840
Who the fuck is KiviriSigmas?

1124
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,880
Who the fuck is what?

1125
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,100
It's KiviriSigmas.

1126
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,500
KiviriSigmas.

1127
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,820
15.

1128
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,100
Team 15.

1129
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,600
That's them.

1130
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,480
Is that who killed us?

1131
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,220
No.

1132
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,000
I realized, by the way, last game, I died to a whole different team.

1133
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,840
Oh, you got shot.

1134
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,860
You must have got shot by a different team in the back.

1135
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,380
Yeah.

1136
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,260
That was in the other house.

1137
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,840
I was... because when we started watching enemy in them.

1138
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,340
Yeah.

1139
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,200
Dragon was enemy's teammate and he hit me for 30.

1140
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah.

1141
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,860
And then I had two other completely different people on my kill feed.

1142
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,200
Oh, that's...

1143
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,420
So I died to a whole different team.

1144
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,760
Yeah, you died to a different team.

1145
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,300
Yeah.

1146
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,520
Oh no, I died so fast.

1147
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,420
The reaper never shot me.

1148
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:32,900
Yeah.

1149
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,020
I mean, yeah.

1150
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,280
Yeah, because of the team in the other building.

1151
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,020
It's okay.

1152
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,000
Now we know our strats.

1153
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,460
I just don't know the map that much.

1154
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,240
Like, I didn't know I was so open in my back.

1155
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,640
Like, it's just...

1156
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,560
That's what I'm saying!

1157
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,040
We could have had World's Edge!

1158
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,160
Really, right?

1159
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,520
I agree.

1160
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,720
World's Edge is so much better.

1161
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:50,940
Yeah!

1162
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,340
See, now!

1163
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,560
Now you agree!

1164
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,500
Fucking this map sucks!

1165
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay, I need to get water.

1166
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,660
I'll be back.

1167
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,860
Yeah.

1168
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,290
And I'm back.

1169
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,270
So what's our team comp exactly?

1170
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,070
Maggie, Newcastle, Pathfinder.

1171
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,650
Wait, Newcastle what?

1172
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,130
Maggie.

1173
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,430
Maggie, Pathfinder.

1174
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,570
So now we have double the walls!

1175
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:42,850
Yeah.

1176
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,730
That's okay.

1177
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,770
We're gonna get like three wins in a row, right guys?

1178
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,090
Yes.

1179
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,790
All the wins.

1180
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,870
Alright, this is it.

1181
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,030
This is where we're locked in.

1182
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,490
Yep.

1183
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,270
I believe.

1184
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,670
Why doesn't it vote somewhere?

1185
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,530
Board Game 1?

1186
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,030
Oh, we can actually vote for that?

1187
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,570
Wait, really?

1188
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,770
Okay, let's Board Game 1.

1189
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:10,790
Let's...

1190
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,850
Do we want a Game 7?

1191
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,390
Yeah!

1192
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,130
Yeah!

1193
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,110
Yeah, let's...

1194
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,690
Yeah!

1195
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,290
Fuck your game!

1196
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,010
Fuck your game!

1197
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,630
Well, it doesn't voice it, but like we just play an additional game.

1198
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,070
So like technically their game doesn't matter.

1199
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,250
I just voted yeah.

1200
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,370
Wait, where can you vote?

1201
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:41,790
Which channel?

1202
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,870
It's restart request.

1203
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,230
Yeah, it's in support.

1204
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,050
It's uh...

1205
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,730
I don't think we're supposed to all vote.

1206
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,890
It's okay.

1207
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,910
No, no, fuck these people.

1208
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,090
Do an extra game so your game doesn't matter anymore.

1209
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,670
That's fucking right.

1210
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,550
We win the vote.

1211
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,950
It's 25 to 18, so we win the vote.

1212
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:07,630
Damn.

1213
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,450
So we are...

1214
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,970
The first game doesn't count?

1215
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,390
No, it does, but like they play...

1216
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,370
We have to play an extra game.

1217
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,290
So technically it doesn't count.

1218
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,550
Because if that means like more points in... Yep, that's six points.

1219
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:21,950
That's six wins for us.

1220
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,990
Yeah, that's six wins for us.

1221
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:24,730
Yeah!

1222
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,130
Okay.

1223
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,450
We can do it.

1224
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:37,350
I have like your audio boosted up now for my end, so like I can hear.

1225
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,110
You know like when you're sick, so like you can't...

1226
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,550
It's like...

1227
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,370
It's harder.

1228
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,050
It's for me right now.

1229
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,690
Like everything is so much more quieter.

1230
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,470
Yeah, yeah.

1231
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,570
Yeah.

1232
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,210
You want me to unblock your ears?

1233
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,090
Oh, yeah.

1234
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,010
Whoa, whoa, what?

1235
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,650
No, no, that's not...

1236
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,070
What?

1237
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,650
Oh, it's gonna be ASMR with Effect and Unlucky.

1238
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,990
Effect helps.

1239
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,170
No, that's not ASMR.

1240
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,990
That's something you don't want to hear.

1241
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,810
Yeah, he doesn't want to hear that.

1242
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,130
Oh, that means you've heard his ASMR.

1243
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,590
Why would...

1244
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,750
He's gonna do loud audio like...

1245
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,730
Like what?

1246
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,210
No, no, no, don't do it.

1247
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,990
Unlucky has so much experience with the ASMR.

1248
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,470
I really do.

1249
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,710
You want me to pull up my professional mic actually?

1250
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,570
Oh, shit!

1251
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,830
You have a professional ASMR mic?

1252
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,050
No, I don't.

1253
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,450
You know that costs like a thousand plus dollars.

1254
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,790
Yeah, I'm gonna play with my nails and, you know, glasses and stuff.

1255
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then, like, get stuck on the ears.

1256
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,710
What?

1257
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,410
Put it on right now.

1258
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,090
My chat wants to hear it.

1259
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,570
Where do we go, though?

1260
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,170
Which team do we push?

1261
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,950
I will see.

1262
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:07,770
We'll figure it out.

1263
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,130
Alright.

1264
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,290
What bro said.

1265
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,290
Last bro said.

1266
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,190
Boss.

1267
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,430
Boss.

1268
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,790
Alright, take an ass.

1269
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,660
Okay.

1270
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,880
Yeah, comms bro, comms.

1271
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,020
Yeah, yeah, where are the comms?

1272
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,260
What do we do?

1273
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,560
It's first game.

1274
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah, yeah, this is our first game, guys.

1275
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,480
First game.

1276
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,300
Alright, micromanage.

1277
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,900
Micro and macromanages.

1278
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,180
Yeah, Effect, come on, man.

1279
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,060
Yeah, Effect, come on.

1280
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,100
The youngest should do it.

1281
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,600
That's what I'm saying.

1282
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,280
His potential is higher than mine.

1283
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,060
Yeah, yeah, his potential is higher.

1284
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,200
You're gonna be the new IGL when Hawkus retires.

1285
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,760
Damn.

1286
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,080
I'd love to see that one.

1287
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,100
Come on.

1288
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,320
Alright, let's see.

1289
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240
God, I don't know how to loot this area.

1290
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,480
It's all so new to me.

1291
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,880
I've never been here before.

1292
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,760
Oh my god.

1293
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,340
Oh, that's good for...

1294
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,340
Damn.

1295
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,840
Damn.

1296
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,800
I need...

1297
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,520
That's not a Mozambique I've summoned.

1298
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,900
I'll take it.

1299
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,480
Bro, Milo just got it.

1300
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,380
This POI is so good.

1301
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,300
Yeah!

1302
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,020
We got it by pure luck, too.

1303
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,720
We rolled it.

1304
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:46,940
Yeah.

1305
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,120
Because I was like, I don't care.

1306
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,160
Yeah.

1307
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:51,900
Oh my god.

1308
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:54,900
We got gashed.

1309
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,060
Put the prize in the bag.

1310
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,880
Okay.

1311
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,500
I really need the enjimag and the bolt.

1312
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,540
Enjimag.

1313
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,360
Let's see.

1314
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,260
Okay, I need another...

1315
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,100
Oh, shit.

1316
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,480
I need another...

1317
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,200
Mozambique if anybody finds one.

1318
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,380
Okay.

1319
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,980
That was one in the...

1320
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,580
Okay, that's a bit too far.

1321
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,000
That would hurt.

1322
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,320
There's a 3x here.

1323
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,180
My ping guy can do Mozambique.

1324
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,700
Oh, okay.

1325
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,800
Alright, I'm good to go.

1326
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,340
My Mozambique has...

1327
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,080
Can you get the cash?

1328
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,280
Yeah, I'm going for it.

1329
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,720
Alright, scan the UV then.

1330
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:40,900
Alright, I'm ready.

1331
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,720
Yeah, scan the UV.

1332
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,360
Are they coming, maybe?

1333
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,480
Yeah, they are, I think.

1334
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:49,960
Yeah, they are.

1335
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1336
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,300
Okay.

1337
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,180
I'mma zip here.

1338
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,200
Alright, I'm waiting for your zip.

1339
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,240
Here I am.

1340
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,600
I'm peeking over in a second.

1341
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,200
Wait.

1342
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,120
Whoa.

1343
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,800
We heard a zip.

1344
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,300
I think they turned around.

1345
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,880
You're scared.

1346
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,260
Yeah, they are, they're like up there.

1347
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,000
Do you want to run into them?

1348
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,420
I have ball.

1349
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,280
Yeah.

1350
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,180
Let's go.

1351
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,000
Alright, I'm right behind.

1352
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,980
I'm a little bit slow.

1353
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:25,720
Wait, wait, wait.

1354
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1355
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,540
Path 1 is back.

1356
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,460
Nades.

1357
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,420
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

1358
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,980
I'm coming up in a second.

1359
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,520
I might be dead.

1360
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,880
Cracked him, cracked him.

1361
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:39,620
Slow.

1362
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,400
Path 1, dead.

1363
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,040
Last one, last one.

1364
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:43,900
I'm backing up.

1365
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,600
Here, I'm coming over.

1366
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:47,860
Yep.

1367
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,100
Nice.

1368
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,200
Pull back, pull back, pull back.

1369
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,860
I'm pulling back, I'm pulling back.

1370
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,740
He's looking, he's looking, he's looking.

1371
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:54,800
Yep.

1372
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,660
Dead.

1373
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:56,940
Nice.

1374
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,720
Well played.

1375
00:44:59,300 --> 00:44:59,580
Yay!

1376
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,220
Let's go, baby!

1377
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,680
Look at that, we got kills!

1378
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:02,780
Look at us go!

1379
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,060
Oh my god, we're locked, we're locked, we're locked, we're locked.

1380
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,400
We're locked, we're so locked, we're so locked.

1381
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:07,800
Locked, locked, locked.

1382
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,980
Alright, I'm finishing, I'm finishing.

1383
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,540
Watch out for them.

1384
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,000
Somebody else is coming.

1385
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,140
I'm going to go to ult, and I'm going to hit the UV then.

1386
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,740
In a second.

1387
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,680
I have so many bots.

1388
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:19,980
Do I need medkit?

1389
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,560
Yeah, I do.

1390
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,960
I have it in alt-excel.

1391
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1392
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,360
Let's go back.

1393
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:29,960
Alright,

1394
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,880
I'll wait for you guys.

1395
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:36,920
Alright, I'll wait for you guys.

1396
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,380
Let's go.

1397
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,180
Let's go over here.

1398
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:42,900
Alright.

1399
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,980
I'll just get the points on the edge.

1400
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,840
I feel like all the good teams are playing zone.

1401
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,440
I think.

1402
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:54,720
Maybe.

1403
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,940
Enemy's team was playing zone, Fun's team was playing zone.

1404
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,900
Since they were there.

1405
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,600
Maybe we won't bump into them.

1406
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,420
Alright, you're edging, you're edging.

1407
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,760
I love edging.

1408
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,500
Damn.

1409
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,340
Those are my specials.

1410
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,040
I love edging.

1411
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,160
What's your opinion effect on edging in Apex?

1412
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:20,920
Ten out of ten.

1413
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,760
In Apex, right?

1414
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,200
Yeah, yeah, in Apex, right?

1415
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,960
I knew you were talking about Apex.

1416
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,640
Wait, I'm going to get the cash quick.

1417
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,240
Okay.

1418
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,340
Yeah, they're here.

1419
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,080
They opened the bin.

1420
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,240
Oh, okay.

1421
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,780
Can I still get the cash quick or no?

1422
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:41,840
Yeah, yeah, go for it.

1423
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,560
Woooo.

1424
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,440
I feel so vulnerable here.

1425
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:50,660
Coming up.

1426
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,640
This is Glapia.

1427
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,580
Huh?

1428
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:54,920
Bangalore, Puffy.

1429
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,920
Shit, they fell down.

1430
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,600
They have white armors.

1431
00:46:59,280 --> 00:46:59,640
Okay.

1432
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,200
Yeah, they do.

1433
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,280
I hit 70 on one.

1434
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,640
I might give them blue armor.

1435
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,160
Who knows?

1436
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,660
Puffy up left.

1437
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,160
I grab it behind you.

1438
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:12,820
They're like over there, I think.

1439
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,580
They're here right now.

1440
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,380
I think more of them.

1441
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,380
They're the same team.

1442
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:20,920
One.

1443
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,040
Cracked two.

1444
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:23,820
Batting.

1445
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,200
Reloading.

1446
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,860
I'm coming in a second.

1447
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,380
They're running through mine.

1448
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,240
Okay.

1449
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:29,960
I'm sipping here.

1450
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,840
Oh, the sip is going to get...

1451
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:32,920
Yup.

1452
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,400
I'm...

1453
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,980
I'm right behind.

1454
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,260
Wait, they're under me or what?

1455
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:40,760
Yeah.

1456
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,180
Cracked half.

1457
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,260
They ulted.

1458
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,460
I met him quick.

1459
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,260
That's fine.

1460
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,000
I hope we don't get pushed from that.

1461
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,620
Here.

1462
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,300
Running away, running away.

1463
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,380
Hard?

1464
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,520
Is that nade from them or...

1465
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,240
Yeah, I think so.

1466
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,000
Right here.

1467
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,240
Down.

1468
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,680
I'm going to fall out here, okay?

1469
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,360
Batting.

1470
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:11,900
Sipping on me.

1471
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,400
That new team behind us?

1472
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:14,880
On me, on me, on me.

1473
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,040
I'm stuck down here.

1474
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:19,840
Let's run away.

1475
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,700
I need to hold her.

1476
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,360
She lived, but I need you to...

1477
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,380
I'm batting, I'm batting.

1478
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,720
Yeah, just play inside here.

1479
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,120
Playing inside for now.

1480
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,160
Yup.

1481
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:34,840
Where are they?

1482
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,180
Somewhere.

1483
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,180
On the upper one.

1484
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:38,880
Over there.

1485
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,460
One guy here.

1486
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,500
Someone here.

1487
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,700
Oh, they bang ulted.

1488
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,540
They're backing up over there.

1489
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,440
Careful, that team behind us.

1490
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,140
Calc.

1491
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,120
Got smoked.

1492
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,440
Being cracked.

1493
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,660
I'm coming to you guys.

1494
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,580
I don't see them right now.

1495
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,740
They're zipping up, yeah.

1496
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,320
Trying to come to you?

1497
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,160
Yeah.

1498
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,080
Slowly walking around like the big fat Newcastle ass here.

1499
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,640
I can ball after them.

1500
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,760
Yeah, I went in.

1501
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,300
Someone here.

1502
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,240
In the smoke, in the smoke.

1503
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,560
I'm getting shot by the other team again.

1504
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:22,920
I'm batting quick.

1505
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,160
Alright, guys.

1506
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,960
Oh, shit.

1507
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,700
I'm batting.

1508
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,460
Okay, I'm backing up.

1509
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,680
Both teams are just running away, bro.

1510
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,720
What the fuck is wrong with them?

1511
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,320
Yeah, they're scared.

1512
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,480
They're so scared.

1513
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,160
I have redeploy.

1514
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,120
We need to use it.

1515
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,520
They're ball calling.

1516
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:41,760
Oh, yeah.

1517
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,700
Oh, they're flashing.

1518
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:45,960
One!

1519
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,960
No!

1520
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,820
I had to run.

1521
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,720
He was so low.

1522
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,940
I have redeploy.

1523
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,060
Yeah, maybe.

1524
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,460
I'm just gonna use it quick.

1525
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,300
Are you smoking me?

1526
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,100
Yeah, I was like, what do you mean?

1527
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:02,740
Yeah, bro, let me smoke.

1528
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,240
I'm smoking, I'm smoking.

1529
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:07,460
Wait.

1530
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,220
Alright, let's get lost, guys.

1531
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,440
There's only two.

1532
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,840
I'm bowling.

1533
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,560
I'm heading over to you, guys.

1534
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,120
There's only two.

1535
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,920
For now.

1536
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,120
Oh, my God.

1537
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:21,460
Watch the ball!

1538
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:22,540
No!

1539
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,620
I got dodged in two!

1540
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,240
That shit was scary.

1541
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,560
Okay.

1542
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:36,880
Um...

1543
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,620
Let's just mirror them, I think.

1544
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,300
They're close in front of me.

1545
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,840
Let me know if you guys find energy ammo.

1546
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,720
I just realized I barely have any.

1547
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:44,740
Yeah.

1548
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,400
Nice.

1549
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,520
Okay.

1550
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,240
I'm gonna craft energy ammo real fast.

1551
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:54,620
I'm gonna craft energy ammo real fast.

1552
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,380
Yep.

1553
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,260
I can...

1554
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
I'm slipping through the room.

1555
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,040
Okay.

1556
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,860
I set the balloon here.

1557
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:04,780
Let's take the balloon.

1558
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,970
I wish we had Valko right now.

1559
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:12,770
I'm just gonna...

1560
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,150
What?

1561
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:13,670
Live?

1562
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:14,910
What?

1563
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,350
Live, guys?

1564
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,190
I'm not gonna live.

1565
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,490
They've been on me.

1566
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,370
Who's that duo?

1567
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,050
I'm under.

1568
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,830
I don't have med kit, so...

1569
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,530
I only got one.

1570
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:32,510
I can give you five.

1571
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,310
Yeah, I'm syringing.

1572
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:35,910
Another full team on the left side here, though.

1573
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,650
Watch out, they don't slip on us.

1574
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,190
I have one syringe left.

1575
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:43,690
Yeah, I'll give you one.

1576
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:44,910
Okay.

1577
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:45,950
Is the safe coming here?

1578
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,450
Yeah, I'm coming too.

1579
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,750
They're chilling down there.

1580
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:50,570
Nice.

1581
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:50,890
Okay.

1582
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,010
Let's go kill them, then.

1583
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:55,990
I have a ball and...

1584
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:57,050
10.

1585
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:59,230
What about the other team?

1586
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:00,990
It was the duo that I know.

1587
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,010
Okay.

1588
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:04,630
Blue armor.

1589
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,030
Who are you shooting at?

1590
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,470
Newcastle and Rampart.

1591
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,190
I have both.

1592
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,830
I'm syringing for myself on the left here.

1593
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,370
What if I'm lucky?

1594
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:16,270
Watch out, they're here though.

1595
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,650
They're looking at me.

1596
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:18,870
Blue.

1597
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:23,490
I'm full healing.

1598
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,890
I'm coming over now.

1599
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:27,430
Fucking them up.

1600
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:27,870
Fucking them up.

1601
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:29,230
One more.

1602
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:29,970
Rampart one.

1603
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:30,090
Dead.

1604
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:30,550
Nice.

1605
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:31,970
I'm close.

1606
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:32,370
Dropping down.

1607
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:33,310
Both dropping down.

1608
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,550
He's gonna curse him.

1609
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:36,510
Rampart dead.

1610
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:36,970
I'm dropping.

1611
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,970
He's over there.

1612
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,710
I see him.

1613
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:43,510
He's grappling.

1614
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:45,810
Where is he?

1615
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,250
He grappled away.

1616
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,550
Yeah, he grappled.

1617
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,330
I'm going to zone.

1618
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,010
I have no sip.

1619
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:54,830
Okay, I need those.

1620
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:55,910
Yeah.

1621
00:52:59,230 --> 00:52:59,930
I got it.

1622
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:00,590
Let's go.

1623
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,350
I'm heading over.

1624
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,090
Every deploy we need it.

1625
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:05,990
I don't think we're gonna kill him.

1626
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,050
Wait, I'm... oh my god, how do I...

1627
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,230
I have no sip, by the way, so hopefully we don't need it.

1628
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,470
Rampart team in there.

1629
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,310
There should be teams coming from right side.

1630
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:17,790
We can gatekeep.

1631
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,750
Shouldn't the Pathfinder solo be coming...

1632
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,270
Okay, never mind.

1633
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:23,810
I was gonna say.

1634
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,090
Close, close, close.

1635
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:26,830
And we're getting shot from left.

1636
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:27,570
Save me, save me.

1637
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,550
Okay.

1638
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,750
Selling.

1639
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,530
Watch out from here, maybe.

1640
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:32,150
Yeah, I'm looking.

1641
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,330
Can we take inside somehow?

1642
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:35,070
Yeah.

1643
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,110
They're inside, they're inside.

1644
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:39,690
On me, on me.

1645
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:41,170
Okay, I'm shot.

1646
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:44,670
Where are they?

1647
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:45,590
I don't understand.

1648
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,330
Can you come up to me and ult?

1649
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:48,870
Ulting?

1650
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,210
What is this building?

1651
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:52,690
Where are they?

1652
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:53,430
Yeah, I don't know.

1653
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,370
They're inside somewhere, bro.

1654
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,610
They're like right below us.

1655
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,210
No, no, no, they're right below us.

1656
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,750
I mean, we're fine, though.

1657
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:00,930
Yeah, we're fine here.

1658
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:03,770
Uh-oh, I kicked you back.

1659
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,510
I'm personal on below.

1660
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,370
No, it worked.

1661
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:07,850
What the fuck?

1662
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:09,230
I'm batting.

1663
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,370
Me too, I'm batting.

1664
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:11,650
Pathfinder.

1665
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:13,850
We should be fine, though, no?

1666
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:14,470
We have zone as well.

1667
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:15,390
Yeah, we have zone, we're chilling.

1668
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,630
Smile, rotation, smile, rotation.

1669
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,510
It was intentional, right?

1670
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,930
Lucky it was so intentional.

1671
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:22,790
Yeah, it was, it was, it was.

1672
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:25,490
Encrypted him on those.

1673
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,190
Yeah, I need to, I need to conserve my energy.

1674
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:28,870
This one has to rotate.

1675
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,270
This one has to rotate next to us, by the way.

1676
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:30,710
I'mma ping.

1677
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,730
When zone's closing, you just Q here, okay?

1678
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:34,170
Okay, okay.

1679
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,870
Like, you Q our back, and then we can peek.

1680
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:36,390
Okay.

1681
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:37,550
Yeah, Q this thing off.

1682
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,030
Put a wall there.

1683
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,410
Put a wall over there?

1684
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:40,810
Okay.

1685
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,490
Yeah, they put a wall.

1686
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:43,450
Okay.

1687
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,090
Okay, I'm not really gonna shoot.

1688
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:50,750
I can't shoot either.

1689
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,230
I need to conserve my energy.

1690
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:54,430
Oh my god.

1691
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,090
What the fuck?

1692
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:55,330
What the fuck?

1693
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,170
Oh, he's like, no, it's Newcastle below us.

1694
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,590
Yeah, by the way, I don't know if this...

1695
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,390
Yeah, yeah, here.

1696
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,430
I don't know, you just can't get a box, you can see.

1697
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:06,630
With the scraper in the game.

1698
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,790
I have ult excel too, if I need to use it.

1699
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:12,210
I know, it's gonna throw us one there, I think.

1700
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:16,610
Can you, you're here in a second now?

1701
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,430
Yeah, I can.

1702
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:19,550
So it blocks our back?

1703
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:20,090
Yeah.

1704
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,250
I'll let you know when it's...

1705
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,210
They're breaking our wall, by the way.

1706
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,370
Yeah.

1707
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,730
Okay, how long for next wall?

1708
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,970
They're right below us, just using the horn.

1709
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,870
How long do you need for next wall?

1710
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:37,150
Um, 87%, 88%.

1711
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,750
Okay, we'll be fine.

1712
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:40,050
You can have some one-shots, by the way.

1713
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,290
What do you want me to ult next, then?

1714
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:46,670
Just the same, maybe again.

1715
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:47,530
It depends on the zone, then.

1716
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:47,950
Okay.

1717
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,270
Just wait.

1718
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:51,770
Okay, I'm not like...

1719
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:52,390
Wait, I wanna...

1720
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:54,410
I wanna figure out this building.

1721
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,610
You can play low on me better as well.

1722
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,350
Isn't there a person here, down here?

1723
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,870
Okay, I think the entrance is other side here, by the way.

1724
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:02,270
Okay.

1725
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,230
I'm peeking the strats here a bit.

1726
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:06,550
Wait, on me, on me, on me!

1727
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,170
I got a shot, I got a shot.

1728
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:08,730
I need a heal.

1729
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:09,350
Nice.

1730
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:11,270
Two guys there.

1731
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,290
I'm batting.

1732
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:16,470
I'm here, I put a wall behind us.

1733
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:19,770
Over here, I don't peek.

1734
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:20,150
Can you watch this?

1735
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:23,950
Yeah, can you just make sure they're not pushing us?

1736
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:25,050
Yeah, yeah.

1737
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:26,590
I'm watching.

1738
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,550
Can you kill the solo, maybe?

1739
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,830
Oh, no, no, it just gets him up there.

1740
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:33,650
Cracked one.

1741
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,890
I don't have... I have ult now.

1742
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:37,450
Okay.

1743
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:37,830
It's fine.

1744
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:39,950
I don't have Q, I don't have Q.

1745
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:40,930
Are you burning him?

1746
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:41,390
Yeah, it's fine.

1747
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:42,010
He's resing.

1748
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:43,670
Can't see him.

1749
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,250
He's gonna pick him up if you see him.

1750
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:45,910
Yeah.

1751
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:47,110
Fuck me.

1752
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,130
Just break this shit.

1753
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:48,490
Oh, okay.

1754
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,350
I don't have that much ammo, that's why.

1755
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:51,070
Yeah, same.

1756
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,450
Yeah, I don't think any of us have much ammo.

1757
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:54,490
I have a shield.

1758
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,270
I hear people below They're not looking, but...

1759
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:58,110
They're...

1760
00:56:58,110 --> 00:56:59,610
They can only come from the other side.

1761
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,430
You got zapped, bro.

1762
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:05,670
We're still in, so we can just chill.

1763
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:06,710
I know, I know.

1764
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:08,010
Okay, okay.

1765
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:08,670
Let's chill for a second.

1766
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,600
I have two cells, by the way.

1767
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:15,880
Okay.

1768
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,320
Oh, I have a lot of bats, but two cells.

1769
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,860
I have a lot of bats.

1770
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,500
Someone's close now, by the way.

1771
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:21,780
They might move.

1772
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,100
Move.

1773
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,460
Oh, no more Q.

1774
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,260
They're under here now, by the way.

1775
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:27,940
They're duo.

1776
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,420
We're still in zone.

1777
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:30,520
Let's see.

1778
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,380
I have Phoenix, sorry.

1779
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:34,840
That's fine, that's fine.

1780
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:36,800
Zip on us.

1781
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
They might be playing on top of us.

1782
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,160
Yeah, we're shot.

1783
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,120
Can you make a new wolf?

1784
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,520
Is he energized?

1785
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,280
Oh, shit!

1786
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,640
He's coming!

1787
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,740
Do you have Q?

1788
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,400
Yeah, yeah.

1789
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:45,980
Q-ing?

1790
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,080
I got hit by the...

1791
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,440
Batting?

1792
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,740
I'm shielding, guys.

1793
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,420
I'm shielding, guys.

1794
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:56,800
Okay, I'm med-kitting.

1795
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,800
I'm just med-kitting, okay?

1796
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,200
Yeah, you can rez after.

1797
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,340
Let me rez after a second.

1798
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:04,560
We'll play up here.

1799
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,520
Yeah, rez now.

1800
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:08,720
Oh!

1801
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:10,760
That'll be good.

1802
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,440
No, no, no.

1803
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,440
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1804
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,420
Oh, no, it's fine.

1805
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:14,980
Just live.

1806
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:15,720
Just live.

1807
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,780
Can you take this off from her box?

1808
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,540
Yeah, just armor shop, yeah, yeah.

1809
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,200
You good?

1810
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,280
Ho, ho, unlucky.

1811
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,780
Ho, ho.

1812
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,440
Oh my god, I got pinned.

1813
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,340
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1814
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,960
I don't know that I was smart.

1815
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,420
Yeah, what were you cooking over there?

1816
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:40,840
Fine, it's fine.

1817
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,180
There's only six squads left.

1818
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,460
Med-kitting.

1819
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,280
Med-kitting, med-kitting, med-kitting.

1820
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,640
I believe in you guys so much, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1821
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:50,880
Alright.

1822
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:51,900
Okay.

1823
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,120
Here you come.

1824
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:55,760
You have bats?

1825
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:56,700
I'm 0-4.

1826
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,000
Thank you.

1827
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,040
Okay, I still have full team below us.

1828
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,300
And I think, by the way, I think the duo is under us.

1829
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,540
Like this little walkthrough, you know?

1830
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:07,580
Yeah.

1831
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,540
Can we just get some info?

1832
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,200
Bow here.

1833
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,540
Both bats on me too.

1834
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,660
I'm gonna destroy this fucking gap here.

1835
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,300
Oh, we gotta go.

1836
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,040
I think.

1837
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:18,900
I'm batting.

1838
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,460
We have time a little bit.

1839
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,580
Let's go after the thing.

1840
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:21,920
Alright, bad, bad, bad.

1841
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,880
In front of us.

1842
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,180
One died.

1843
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,660
I can't right now.

1844
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah, I know, I know, I'm batting.

1845
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:31,740
I'm batting.

1846
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:32,940
Can we play somewhere?

1847
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,120
You have zip?

1848
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,020
No, yeah.

1849
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,560
Can you zip inside here, bottom?

1850
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,600
I'm zipping balloon, bro.

1851
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,260
Bro, fucking deadslap.

1852
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:45,260
I'm taking balloon second.

1853
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,320
There's two teams up there, bro.

1854
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,020
I'm so smart, bro.

1855
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,020
Jump on the roof, jump on the roof!

1856
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,180
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1857
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,240
And come to me, we jump this side.

1858
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,060
Yeah, yeah.

1859
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,120
When you're with me, okay?

1860
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:56,920
Yeah.

1861
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:57,420
You're with me?

1862
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,220
Let's go, I have to jump.

1863
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:58,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go.

1864
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,680
There's full team below us.

1865
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,160
Puffy on me.

1866
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:00,740
Yep, yeah.

1867
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:02,240
Walk inside.

1868
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:02,760
Walk inside.

1869
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,120
Kill him.

1870
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,420
Walk, walk, walk.

1871
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:04,700
Dead.

1872
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:04,940
Swapping.

1873
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:05,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1874
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:07,600
You guys coming.

1875
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:08,840
Cracked them all.

1876
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,300
Swing, swing.

1877
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1878
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,620
I'm making it inside, making it inside.

1879
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:11,820
Save me.

1880
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,380
You're coming, you're coming.

1881
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:12,720
I'm holding.

1882
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,360
There's team below us.

1883
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,420
Yeah, yeah.

1884
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:16,780
It's fine.

1885
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:17,940
I'm holding.

1886
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,840
I'm getting some loot for us.

1887
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:20,900
Okay.

1888
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,740
Can we break up?

1889
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,280
I'm good, I'm good, actually.

1890
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,240
I'm 1-5, I'm 1-5 only.

1891
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,700
Top 4, by the way, top 4.

1892
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,820
This team here, I'm gonna kill them, I'm gonna fuck them, okay?

1893
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,600
Look, I'm not in here.

1894
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,260
They're cooking, bro.

1895
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,780
They're so cooked.

1896
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,580
They're cooking!

1897
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,400
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1898
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,040
Holy shit!

1899
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:42,760
Left, left, left.

1900
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,480
Look at Newcastle, yeah.

1901
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,460
They're cooking!

1902
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,560
Look at the zone, the way it comes on.

1903
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,380
Look at the zone, look at the zone.

1904
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,540
Come to the stairs, come to the stairs, come to the stairs, come to the stairs.

1905
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:50,800
I know where everyone is.

1906
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,420
There's someone in Newcastle.

1907
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,600
Outside, outside, he's outside.

1908
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,080
Outside?

1909
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:53,600
Look in here.

1910
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:54,580
Yeah, I'm looking.

1911
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,540
I'm holding left, they're fighting.

1912
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:57,720
What about left, though?

1913
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,060
The one on the left, the one on the left.

1914
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,760
He's dying, he's looking right, he's looking right.

1915
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:02,560
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

1916
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:03,760
Dead?

1917
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,960
Holy shit!

1918
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:09,920
Holy shit!

1919
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,140
Holy fuck!

1920
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,420
You guys are...

1921
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,260
That was insane.

1922
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,640
I was cooking.

1923
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,720
You guys were cooking, that was fucking insane!

1924
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,740
Bro, the oop play was insane.

1925
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:24,560
Oh my god.

1926
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,860
We fucked that team.

1927
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,980
Holy fuck!

1928
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,180
That shit was so crazy.

1929
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,160
You're like, I'm cooking them, I'm cooking them!

1930
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,220
You threw like six fucking nades at that poor guy.

1931
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,080
Yeah.

1932
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,520
Oh my god, bro.

1933
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,820
Guys, that's the MVP, guys!

1934
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:48,320
Oh my god, bro.

1935
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:48,640
That's the...

1936
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,260
Who did we kill?

1937
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,000
SkinnySigma, who would've done that?

1938
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:54,860
You guys did it.

1939
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,120
Who the fuck is SkinnySigma?

1940
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,600
I think it was them.

1941
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,080
That oop play was golden, bro.

1942
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:02,540
Holy shit.

1943
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,200
Yeah, that shit was crazy.

1944
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:04,620
That was crazy.

1945
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,500
That was good, that was good.

1946
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,920
That was good, that was a good game.

1947
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:14,360
Yeah.

1948
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,360
No, I didn't miss the balloon zip!

1949
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,200
I saw it!

1950
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,780
I came back just when they zipped up!

1951
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,480
That's crazy.

1952
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,060
That was such a gamble.

1953
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,400
Like, I can't believe it worked.

1954
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:27,940
Yeah.

1955
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,240
I literally saw like six people looking at us and I was thinking that Z-Pro.

1956
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,620
Oh my god.

1957
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,300
Yeah, I can't believe you guys lived!

1958
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,480
I don't know, it was just the oop play.

1959
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:42,920
It was insane.

1960
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:50,340
Like, I still came back and you guys were like 20% HP and I was like, what the fuck?

1961
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,040
Yeah, I don't know.

1962
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:53,800
Same.

1963
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,020
We figured out our comp.

1964
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,600
We figured out our game plan.

1965
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,400
That was it.

1966
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,340
The first game was worth it.

1967
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:02,920
It was a warm up.

1968
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:03,360
It was so planned.

1969
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,700
Yeah, they were so planned.

1970
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,520
It wasn't like, should we go here?

1971
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,360
Oh hey, it's free!

1972
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,680
Nobody's here, let's stay here!

1973
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:18,820
Look at that.

1974
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,280
This is it.

1975
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,400
We figured it out.

1976
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,220
I wonder which team was the one we killed.

1977
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,420
Oh, team 11.

1978
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,640
That poor team.

1979
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,520
Oh, we killed Fulci's team.

1980
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,460
Oh no.

1981
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:36,960
Oh my god.

1982
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,020
I like how he was so sad about it.

1983
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,180
I could hear it in his voice.

1984
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,220
This is it, guys.

1985
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,680
We're locked in.

1986
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:51,560
Now we have one more game and then a 30 minute intermission where we get unlocked.

1987
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,160
Oh my god.

1988
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,640
30 minute intermission to get unlocked.

1989
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,080
That's actually insane.

1990
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,820
This is it.

1991
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,640
This is it.

1992
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,380
Team fucking cooked!

1993
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,900
My death was their character arc.

1994
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,340
They literally leveled up after I died.

1995
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:23,180
They leveled up after I died.

1996
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,320
It was worth dying.

1997
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,900
They had to lock in after that.

1998
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:31,760
They're like, oh shit, it's just the two of us.

1999
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,860
She left and they were no longer sick.

2000
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:39,800
She left and they were no longer sick.

2001
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,220
My sick...

2002
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,480
My sick...

2003
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,680
Yeah, yeah, the debuff was gone.

2004
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,240
After that.

2005
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,720
It's crazy.

2006
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,340
Oh my god, alright.

2007
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,360
Oh my god, alright.

2008
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,860
I wonder what our seventh game is gonna be on.

2009
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,020
Our seventh game is on...

2010
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:01,980
Oh, it's on Storm Point.

2011
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,500
So we have shitty loot for four games.

2012
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,440
Oh no.

2013
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,760
No, why did we vote for a seventh game?

2014
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,380
Can we change the water thing?

2015
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,720
Yeah, can we change back to no?

2016
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,520
Yeah, I'm down, I'm down.

2017
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,860
We voted no.

2018
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,700
Why are we playing an extra game?

2019
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:22,940
Alright, I voted no.

2020
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:24,980
I took my vote away too.

2021
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,540
I took my vote away and voted no.

2022
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,520
I took my vote away and voted no.

2023
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,340
It's okay.

2024
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,240
If we win like four more games in a row, then the seventh game won't matter.

2025
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,400
True.

2026
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,300
Yeah.

2027
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,780
Nobody can catch up after that.

2028
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,940
I believe.

2029
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,800
I can fly.

2030
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,840
I believe I can touch the sky.

2031
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,400
Look at that.

2032
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,120
You're so locked in.

2033
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:08,070
I wonder if they're going to do the same thing.

2034
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:08,990
The other team.

2035
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,570
Or are they going to run away now?

2036
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,330
I don't think they will come again.

2037
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,570
Oh, they got scared.

2038
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:17,070
They're like...

2039
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:19,110
I hope they do.

2040
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:21,550
I hope they're like, we can win this.

2041
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,850
We took down Effect that one time.

2042
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:25,830
Yeah.

2043
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:27,810
I don't know.

2044
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:29,790
I was myself in that fight, can't lie.

2045
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:31,530
Don't be like...

2046
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,790
I was shooting the guy far right.

2047
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,130
I shot the guy far right too.

2048
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:36,370
I traded with him.

2049
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:37,950
He gave me 100, I gave him 120.

2050
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:40,750
Yeah.

2051
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,390
I hope they come back so we can get free points.

2052
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:48,030
We need those three kills.

2053
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:50,630
Those extra three kills.

2054
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:51,810
For real.

2055
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,820
Oh my god.

2056
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:00,840
Why are we...

2057
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,940
Start game.

2058
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,600
Start game.

2059
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,140
Ready.

2060
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:07,380
Are.

2061
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:11,840
Yeah, true.

2062
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,280
Taking so long.

2063
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,120
Yeah.

2064
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,140
Where's the third game?

2065
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,440
Are they doing promos right now?

2066
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,420
They told me it was in the 30 minute intermission.

2067
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,760
I can take a nap, dude.

2068
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,820
In between that.

2069
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:26,760
True.

2070
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,100
Nap time.

2071
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,840
Oh, they're doing replay.

2072
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,000
Oh.

2073
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,120
Oh.

2074
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,460
Oh, they're replaying us?

2075
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,880
Why are they replaying us?

2076
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,260
During like...

2077
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:42,520
Because we won?

2078
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,840
No, but this is like the fight, the first fight.

2079
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,160
When we chased people.

2080
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,320
And then they all ran away.

2081
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,320
Bro, that game was weird as fuck though.

2082
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,580
Yeah, they were all like...

2083
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,000
We ran in circles and just trying to find one of the other teams.

2084
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,120
Yeah, yeah.

2085
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,720
They all like ran in circles around us because it felt like they were working together.

2086
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,020
They'd be like, we can't give them kills.

2087
01:07:59,020 --> 01:07:59,280
Let's...

2088
01:07:59,280 --> 01:07:59,880
Yeah.

2089
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,280
Oh, now our replay is gone.

2090
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:07,840
Our replay.

2091
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:13,500
No.

2092
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,220
Oh my god.

2093
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,680
Oh, okay, now they're replaying how the final...

2094
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,200
I like how you guys were just there.

2095
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:35,160
The fact you guys just let them fight.

2096
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,160
That's crazy.

2097
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,660
They're really just chilling in the corner.

2098
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,120
The Mad Maggie was such a good pick.

2099
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:49,700
Yeah.

2100
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,300
Is the queue getting a separate wall though, by the way?

2101
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,080
If you shoot into it?

2102
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:57,760
Yeah.

2103
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,060
There's like a small timing before that.

2104
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,620
When it's not as up...

2105
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,940
Like when it's not activated yet, you know?

2106
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,000
Okay.

2107
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,140
Oh, that is interesting.

2108
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,170
Third place is...

2109
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:13,370
Dragon's team.

2110
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:15,430
I'm not surprised.

2111
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,740
Oh my god, let's go.

2112
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,080
Let's go, finally.

2113
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,620
This game, baby.

2114
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,050
I believe.

2115
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:35,090
We have a loot path for that shit POI too.

2116
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,430
We could scroll up and loot paths and find it.

2117
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:38,770
That would be true.

2118
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:41,610
Oh, no we don't.

2119
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,190
Because it was like for Launchpad 2.

2120
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:46,070
Oh yeah, true.

2121
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,550
I mean, it's fine.

2122
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,070
We'll just figure out something.

2123
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,150
We can figure it out, I believe.

2124
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:54,090
We figure things out live.

2125
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:55,750
Is it?

2126
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,790
We don't need an actual IGL.

2127
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,780
We all just flagged.

2128
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,660
Our rotation was perfect.

2129
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,220
We didn't even need to IGL.

2130
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:06,900
Yeah, I know, right?

2131
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,900
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

2132
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,420
Like everything just happened.

2133
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,280
We don't need an IGL.

2134
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,340
It just happened.

2135
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,520
The zone came to us.

2136
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah, the zone came to us.

2137
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,960
Nobody was there in like the rotations we rotated in.

2138
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,200
Wait, that's a bit of shit server me.

2139
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:24,420
I got 10 packs.

2140
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,520
I got 150 ping.

2141
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,260
I'm lagging a bit.

2142
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,100
Tell them to restart.

2143
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,060
RESTART!

2144
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,420
It would be good for sure.

2145
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,160
I'm at 20 packs lost.

2146
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,100
220 pings.

2147
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:37,760
Woah.

2148
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,200
Tell them to restart.

2149
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,960
They will have worse.

2150
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,980
Maybe try restarting the game.

2151
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,400
Yeah.

2152
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,480
I can message and be like restart request.

2153
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,400
Yeah.

2154
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:55,640
I'll do it.

2155
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,980
Are you going to restart?

2156
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,380
Or restart your own game?

2157
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,400
It's fine.

2158
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,460
I'll just see the zone first and then I'll do it.

2159
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,440
I can't believe it.

2160
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,560
They nerfed us.

2161
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,180
We did too well in the first game so they were like...

2162
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,100
Yeah.

2163
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,160
I have gold energy marker for someone.

2164
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:17,660
Oh.

2165
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,900
Give it to them.

2166
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,080
Lucky.

2167
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I got purple as well.

2168
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,360
Okay.

2169
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:25,560
Yeah.

2170
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,260
I'll have it then.

2171
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:27,640
Oh.

2172
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,580
I need a Mosem.

2173
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,180
I still don't know how to loot this efficiently.

2174
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,100
I'm so...

2175
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,980
There's just so much loot.

2176
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:37,260
Yeah.

2177
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:37,880
Don't be greedy.

2178
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:41,940
Oh.

2179
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:42,060
Hey.

2180
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:42,380
Nemesis.

2181
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,040
Is it better now?

2182
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,180
I have to restart now.

2183
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,380
I'm not restarting yet.

2184
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,100
Oh.

2185
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:49,420
Shit.

2186
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,020
You're not even back.

2187
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:51,980
You're still...

2188
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,340
I'm dropping the gold energy marker on the Nemesis.

2189
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:56,480
Okay.

2190
01:11:59,220 --> 01:11:59,880
Oh no.

2191
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,400
He's still...

2192
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,500
He's still AFK.

2193
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,240
Yeah.

2194
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:04,740
It takes a while.

2195
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,120
I don't know how to...

2196
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,300
I have a new PC.

2197
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,080
I don't know why people's games take so long.

2198
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,760
I mean, I think it takes for me so long because of my...

2199
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:16,980
My ping?

2200
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,520
My tab alt just takes long in general.

2201
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,780
I think if I would play native it would be fine.

2202
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:25,780
Alright.

2203
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:26,140
I'll just use it.

2204
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,500
I think it went away a little bit.

2205
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,200
Alright.

2206
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,840
Maybe with more people dying.

2207
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:33,820
Ah.

2208
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:34,120
Maybe.

2209
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:34,600
I don't know.

2210
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,000
Usually that works.

2211
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:36,360
Ah.

2212
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,680
It's fine.

2213
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,120
Whatever.

2214
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:38,680
I'll just play it.

2215
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:39,100
This is game.

2216
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:39,900
I don't care.

2217
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,380
I have second modem.

2218
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:42,620
Woo.

2219
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,060
Nice.

2220
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:44,880
That's all I need.

2221
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,120
Where do we go?

2222
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:51,680
I will.

2223
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,120
Oh yeah.

2224
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:52,460
Scan.

2225
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:54,460
Yeah.

2226
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,240
I'm gonna hit the...

2227
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,640
I'm gonna get the cash here.

2228
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:01,280
Yay!

2229
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,780
I'm gonna go...

2230
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,700
Scan quick.

2231
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,480
I'm 2-4 by the way.

2232
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,300
I didn't do too much yet.

2233
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,300
12.

2234
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,390
I didn't even get that.

2235
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,570
That backpack is so far.

2236
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:23,030
Using grapple.

2237
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:24,430
I'm scanning.

2238
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:27,270
I spotted our enemy.

2239
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:27,910
Yeah.

2240
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:28,690
Our team is still there.

2241
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:30,370
Wanna go kill?

2242
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:31,310
Yeah.

2243
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:35,430
We're going to Homburg Lops.

2244
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:38,150
There's a balloon you can take.

2245
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:39,670
Can I take the balloon?

2246
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:41,150
Yep.

2247
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,760
Wait for you first.

2248
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,760
So I know how to...

2249
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,920
How to do this fly.

2250
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,080
Am I right in 2?

2251
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:53,620
They're here.

2252
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:54,320
They opened the bin.

2253
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,220
Yay!

2254
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,120
We're coming for you.

2255
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:06,480
It'll be funny if we died.

2256
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:07,920
No.

2257
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,800
We tried so hard to come over.

2258
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:18,680
And then...

2259
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,600
That's a new view to watch out.

2260
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:25,360
Can I see you?

2261
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:26,860
He's scanning me.

2262
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,280
I think he's here.

2263
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:29,740
That's 1%.

2264
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:29,980
It's ours.

2265
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,700
I'm going left.

2266
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:32,900
Go left.

2267
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,100
There's a guy left.

2268
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:36,560
On top.

2269
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,580
I'm trying to get to...

2270
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,680
I'm the slowest.

2271
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,640
I can zip up.

2272
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:44,060
He's looking.

2273
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,300
I'm burning him.

2274
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,640
Push shield.

2275
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:50,740
Half me.

2276
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:51,620
Half cracked.

2277
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:52,120
Okay.

2278
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:52,420
Nice.

2279
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:54,800
I'm with Effect.

2280
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,420
I'm healing.

2281
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,460
I need heal too.

2282
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,960
I'm dodging Bangles.

2283
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,500
I can...

2284
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,040
I'm going bottom here.

2285
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,000
I'm with Effect.

2286
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,320
Maybe come from here.

2287
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,280
Heal and up.

2288
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,600
He's above me.

2289
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:18,940
Yeah, I hear them.

2290
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,580
I'm leading.

2291
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,840
Where is Zip?

2292
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,680
I'm playing up.

2293
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,640
I can't go up right now.

2294
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:31,460
I fucked up.

2295
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,700
I cracked him.

2296
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:34,520
Okay.

2297
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,240
I'm covering you.

2298
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:39,060
I'm going to shield too.

2299
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,120
It's hard.

2300
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,360
Maybe...

2301
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,060
I have bottle.

2302
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,260
Okay, ready?

2303
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:48,980
I'm with you.

2304
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,500
I'm with you too.

2305
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,800
I can grab him whenever.

2306
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,380
Grabbing up here.

2307
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,380
I'm holding.

2308
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,080
I'm going to syringe him just in case.

2309
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:02,900
I'm here behind you.

2310
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,440
In front of me on the cannon.

2311
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,120
They are zipping away.

2312
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,140
They are here actually still.

2313
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:08,600
I'm batting.

2314
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:10,960
Cracked Pathfinder.

2315
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,060
Cracked 100.

2316
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:12,640
I'm batting.

2317
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,380
I'm batting.

2318
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,020
I'm batting too.

2319
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,020
Coming.

2320
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,260
I'm heading over now.

2321
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,040
She's low.

2322
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,440
I'm going to rez.

2323
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:23,920
One shot.

2324
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:24,660
You can kill her.

2325
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,280
One left.

2326
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:26,940
Plus one here.

2327
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:27,560
Oh no.

2328
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,160
I can't see.

2329
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,080
I couldn't see them.

2330
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,280
I was just lagging so much.

2331
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,340
I was grappling.

2332
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,380
Yeah, I couldn't see them.

2333
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:40,660
That's fine.

2334
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,320
At least we don't lag here.

2335
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,160
Or the next game, right?

2336
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,380
No.

2337
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,460
Not with the wave.

2338
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:51,000
Yeah, for like an hour or something.

2339
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:51,620
No!

2340
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,620
Oh yeah, we have to wait an hour.

2341
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,620
Bro, what the fuck?

2342
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,540
I'm fucking going to play a pub.

2343
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,580
Yeah, it's going to take so long.

2344
01:16:58,700 --> 01:16:59,740
Yeah, it's going to be an hour.

2345
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,720
It's actually going to be 30 minutes.

2346
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,560
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't have pushed this team.

2347
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,920
We have to wait 30 matches after.

2348
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:10,720
No!

2349
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:13,580
Fine.

2350
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,120
We could play a pub if you mean.

2351
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,240
I'm going to play a pub.

2352
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,320
I'm going to go nap for an hour, actually.

2353
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:23,840
You're going to nap for an hour?

2354
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:24,520
Wait, really?

2355
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:26,480
Bro!

2356
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,080
I'm going to play a pub.

2357
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,180
I can't do this for an hour.

2358
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,240
I have nothing.

2359
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,120
Yeah.

2360
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,940
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't have pushed that when you were lagging.

2361
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,440
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't have pushed that when you were lagging.

2362
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:45,820
It was fine.

2363
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,620
It wasn't that bad.

2364
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,340
I mean, we were shooting havoc and shit because it was delayed lagging.

2365
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:52,020
Yeah.

2366
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,560
It was terrible.

2367
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,100
That sounds fucking damn bad.

2368
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:58,500
Yeah.

2369
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,580
Yeah, man.

2370
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:02,500
Yeah.

2371
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,340
I couldn't see the Pathfinder.

2372
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:08,800
He blended in with the red zone.

2373
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,940
I was so confused there.

2374
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,120
It was also their Pred player too, so that fucked me up.

2375
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,180
I was like, no!

2376
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,380
It's fine.

2377
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,040
Oh, man.

2378
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,300
What do we play on their map?

2379
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:27,940
Oh, yeah.

2380
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:28,520
Is it the one I get?

2381
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,320
Yeah, what do we play?

2382
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:31,540
Oh, yeah.

2383
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,180
Is it the one I get?

2384
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:35,540
Is it the one I get?

2385
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:40,160
I don't think so.

2386
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,540
I don't know yet.

2387
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,340
I don't know yet.

2388
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,960
Alright, we'll figure it out.

2389
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:50,240
Alright, we'll figure it out.

2390
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,780
Depends how we want to play.

2391
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,100
It's just edge though.

2392
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,220
Yeah.

2393
01:18:55,660 --> 01:19:01,020
We have different teams around us this time.

2394
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,380
We have different teams around us this time.

2395
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,860
Who's next to us?

2396
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,840
I think they're like...

2397
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:08,160
I think they're like...

2398
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,440
We have Dragon's team next to us to our right.

2399
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:11,980
We have Dragon's team next to us to our right.

2400
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,640
And then, I don't know who's left side is, but...

2401
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:15,900
And then, I don't know who's left side is, but...

2402
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,860
Dragon's next to us.

2403
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,480
And then, Fun is next to Dragon.

2404
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:21,220
And then, Fun is next to Dragon.

2405
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,400
So, most likely...

2406
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,820
I mean, it'd be easier to push left team than right team.

2407
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:32,120
So, most likely...

2408
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:32,120
I mean, it'd be easier to push left team than right team.

2409
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,480
Because they're there.

2410
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:35,820
Yeah, we'll see.

2411
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,920
I mean, definitely want to play Path.

2412
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,560
But, I don't know what else.

2413
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:44,440
But, I don't know what else.

2414
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:44,860
What do you want to play?

2415
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,380
Just play what you want to play.

2416
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,600
Well, I say Newcastle.

2417
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,500
Well, I say Newcastle.

2418
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:56,760
Okay.

2419
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:00,800
Alright, I'll say Newcastle.

2420
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,560
Oh my god, my fucking duo is AFK.

2421
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,120
Are you serious?

2422
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:04,820
Oh my god, my fucking duo is AFK.

2423
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:04,820
Are you serious?

2424
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,000
Bro, I wanted to fucking practice.

2425
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,140
Oh my god.

2426
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,440
I did a pub and he's AFK.

2427
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,520
And I can't practice.

2428
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,100
Shake your head.

2429
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:18,080
Shake my head.

2430
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,100
Alright, I'll die instantly, I guess.

2431
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:22,560
Alright, I'll die instantly, I guess.

2432
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:22,820
Alright, I'll die instantly, I guess.

2433
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,560
I

2434
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:28,900
guess I'll play Bang.

2435
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,680
You'll play Bang?

2436
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:31,700
Yeah.

2437
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,480
Yeah, I think it's good.

2438
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:35,640
Stormpoint.

2439
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,040
Is this Stormpoint like a Bang map?

2440
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,380
Yeah.

2441
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,820
I don't know if it's shot.

2442
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,740
I don't know if it's shot.

2443
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:49,020
We can play Newcastle.

2444
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,400
Yes, we do.

2445
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,840
You play Newcastle still?

2446
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:54,440
Okay.

2447
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:55,600
Alright.

2448
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,080
Yeah, I don't know what to play.

2449
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,000
Other than...

2450
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,720
Other than Newcastle.

2451
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,520
What the fuck?

2452
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:14,170
I also haven't been paying attention to competitive Apex in a long time.

2453
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,410
So, I have no idea.

2454
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:17,330
What is meta now.

2455
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:20,270
Yeah, like Newcastle-ish.

2456
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,710
Anyways, like Newcastle.

2457
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:22,770
Yeah, I saw a lot.

2458
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:25,190
Other than Newcastle, I don't know what else people play.

2459
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:30,470
Crypto.

2460
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:31,930
Crypto?

2461
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:33,790
Do we play Crypto?

2462
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:39,510
I mean, I can if you want me to.

2463
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:43,270
You want me to play Crypto?

2464
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,390
I think Newcastle is better.

2465
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:49,270
Okay, I'll play Newcastle.

2466
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:50,670
I'll play Newcastle.

2467
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,030
Don't we play one mana?

2468
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,510
We don't.

2469
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:59,050
Play what?

2470
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:01,150
We play four more Storm Point now, right?

2471
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,350
Yeah, we play four Storm Point and then it's over.

2472
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:09,690
If we get another first place, then we're in a safe area.

2473
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,530
For that $100, guys!

2474
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:13,250
For that $100, guys!

2475
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:15,370
Oh my god.

2476
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:18,310
$100.

2477
01:22:18,430 --> 01:22:21,850
Yeah, because we have two zero-point games.

2478
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:26,750
Why were you lagging?

2479
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:27,770
I don't know.

2480
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:29,610
Yeah, why were you lagging?

2481
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:31,030
Why were you throwing, man?

2482
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:32,350
I don't know, man.

2483
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:38,410
If you weren't lagging, we could have won.

2484
01:22:39,610 --> 01:22:41,070
Yeah, I would have.

2485
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,070
What do you mean we wouldn't have?

2486
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:44,490
I mean, we would.

2487
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:45,910
Oh, shit.

2488
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:46,290
No!

2489
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:48,810
My AFK guys left.

2490
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:50,030
Holy shit, bro.

2491
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,490
What just happened?

2492
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:52,250
Yeah, I forgot, people.

2493
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:52,910
I think that's better.

2494
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:57,610
No, don't kill me.

2495
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:00,010
That guy's one.

2496
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:02,490
Oh, she's one.

2497
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:07,960
Selling.

2498
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,840
Oh, you guys are playing rank?

2499
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,160
Yeah, yeah.

2500
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,160
I thought I was going to take a fucking nap.

2501
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:15,920
Coming?

2502
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:17,440
Probably should have.

2503
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:19,640
It's too late now.

2504
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,870
Yeah, you guys are playing PredRank.

2505
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:27,070
I don't want to do that.

2506
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,790
They already crafted banners on me, I think.

2507
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:31,410
That ain't for me right now.

2508
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:36,290
Yeah, of course they're playing rank.

2509
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:39,890
Effect is like rank 535 right now.

2510
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:41,550
I got put down.

2511
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:43,350
I just got too pumped.

2512
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:45,670
By the golden Valk.

2513
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:46,690
Why did you guys duck?

2514
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:48,570
Damn.

2515
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,090
That guy's probably down.

2516
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:56,130
Guys, I'm a pumped player right now, guys.

2517
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:57,650
I just know when I'm playing rank.

2518
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:59,090
I'll get on the banner, by the way.

2519
01:23:59,130 --> 01:23:59,370
Good job.

2520
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:03,070
He's still on you, I think.

2521
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:03,950
Yeah, yeah.

2522
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,040
Don't worry, I got it.

2523
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:10,540
Thanks, man.

2524
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:11,480
Nice.

2525
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,120
Fucking massive, bro.

2526
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,260
Shit.

2527
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,000
Whoa.

2528
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,500
Did you guys live?

2529
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:21,820
Yeah.

2530
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,320
I knew it.

2531
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:24,700
I always believed in you guys.

2532
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,240
I believe a lot in Effect, too.

2533
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:28,560
Oh yeah, sorry.

2534
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,840
I only believe in Effect, as well.

2535
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,320
Hey, hey, hey.

2536
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,910
Guys, let us know when the game is...

2537
01:24:44,910 --> 01:24:46,550
Let us know when the game is over.

2538
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,550
So then we can time the 30 minutes.

2539
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:53,810
So we can do the 30 minute timer.

2540
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:56,070
It's so crazy that it's 30.

2541
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:58,150
I feel like it should be less than 30 minutes.

2542
01:24:58,930 --> 01:24:59,510
It should be a lot.

2543
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:00,810
It's actually a lot.

2544
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,670
Yeah, it's a lot for shouting out sponsors.

2545
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:05,330
I feel like...

2546
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:06,890
I guess if it's like...

2547
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:08,650
I feel like if...

2548
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:12,950
I guess if they requested it to sponsor the tournament, I guess that makes sense.

2549
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:13,890
But still...

2550
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,750
Oh my god, it's...

2551
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:17,550
Crazy, man.

2552
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:19,630
And you get warmed down.

2553
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,270
It's not even warm up anymore.

2554
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,050
I think we have four games then.

2555
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:29,190
The first one is going to be for the warm up, too.

2556
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,090
We gotta like warm up again.

2557
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:35,050
What the fuck?

2558
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:36,950
Oh my god.

2559
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,270
I trolled there.

2560
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:50,930
Got bats from you?

2561
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:51,550
Whoa.

2562
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:52,950
I didn't want that.

2563
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:55,010
No!

2564
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:58,990
I don't think he had...

2565
01:25:58,990 --> 01:25:59,650
I thought this was...

2566
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:02,210
That was his other...

2567
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:03,130
That wasn't his teammate.

2568
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:05,490
Fighting.

2569
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:07,050
East.

2570
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:09,250
Nice creation, XVI.

2571
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:11,710
Nice creation, XVI.

2572
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,150
I'm so safe.

2573
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:18,490
I'm so safe.

2574
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:18,710
I'm so safe.

2575
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:22,090
Graves, please.

2576
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:22,870
Graves, please.

2577
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:25,430
Mm-hmm.

2578
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:30,330
Please.

2579
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,260
Planting above it.

2580
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:39,860
Oh, thank god.

2581
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:40,980
This won't hurt.

2582
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:41,600
Hold on.

2583
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,420
Bang one shot on you.

2584
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,120
Mm-hmm.

2585
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:46,680
Dead.

2586
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:48,620
Dead.

2587
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:00,900
Whoa.

2588
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:02,380
Hey.

2589
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,300
I need shields.

2590
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:09,980
I'll be close.

2591
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:10,620
I hope we got an enemy.

2592
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:18,800
Are you serious?

2593
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:19,300
Okay.

2594
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,580
I got fucked up.

2595
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,280
In my little pub game.

2596
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:27,440
I got fucked up.

2597
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,360
I got double...

2598
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,200
I got double headshot.

2599
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:32,160
Okay, that makes more sense.

2600
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,180
I got double headshot.

2601
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:36,440
What the...

2602
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,120
That guy.

2603
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,240
Did you get fucked up?

2604
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:41,380
Yeah, I did.

2605
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,320
Bro.

2606
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,740
What is going on?

2607
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,520
Why is this random guy?

2608
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:52,700
Why is this random guy?

2609
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,640
This is the most passive duo ever.

2610
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,720
Oh, nice shots, though.

2611
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,220
Oh, nice shots, though.

2612
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:00,540
Need to recharge my shields.

2613
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:01,640
Holy.

2614
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,540
Where's the last one?

2615
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:04,840
No idea, bro.

2616
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:05,280
I mean...

2617
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,660
These guys were more separated than anything else in my life.

2618
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:10,080
Holy shit.

2619
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,560
Oh, you're a third?

2620
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,480
Fuck am I watching?

2621
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:17,800
Last one.

2622
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,280
Stay up.

2623
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:22,580
I need to recharge my shields.

2624
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:33,720
Yeah.

2625
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:35,500
Nice.

2626
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,600
Yay, my duo won his... Oh, he's controller.

2627
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,020
Yay!

2628
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,220
That's pretty much...

2629
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,100
Defect and unlucky right now.

2630
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:49,040
Scanning your V.

2631
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:51,540
Nobody here.

2632
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,020
What the fuck was that?

2633
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:55,680
That's called...

2634
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,600
This guy pushed up to him and died.

2635
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,100
Because my duo was a controller player.

2636
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,900
Bro, looking like a nap angle out here, bro.

2637
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:06,260
I can't lie.

2638
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,400
It's just...

2639
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:10,500
Bro, I don't know.

2640
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,280
I'm so low-key now.

2641
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,460
Are you?

2642
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,680
I feel amazing, I can't lie.

2643
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:14,940
I don't at all.

2644
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:15,580
I'm ready to win.

2645
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,760
I'm so good, bro.

2646
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,200
I can't lie.

2647
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:24,520
The longer it gets, the more sick he's getting.

2648
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,600
Yeah, I just...

2649
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,900
He's feeling it.

2650
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:30,120
His temperature is like, I don't know, like 500 degrees.

2651
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,000
He's feeling it right now.

2652
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,160
My eyes are like burning and like...

2653
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,660
All the ambulance, that's all I'm saying.

2654
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:41,320
I feel so confident right now.

2655
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,480
With this team.

2656
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,940
Don't worry, don't worry.

2657
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,720
He can do it.

2658
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,720
He just gotta lock in, you know?

2659
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,060
He just gotta lock in.

2660
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,920
I think behind us, too.

2661
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:06,460
Guys, let us know when the game ends so we can time the 30 minutes, guys.

2662
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,160
We're all in life support right now.

2663
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,880
Effect is our life support.

2664
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:23,580
As the only healthy person in this team, he's our health support.

2665
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,500
He's our life support.

2666
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:26,800
He's our health support.

2667
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,260
Alright, 30 minutes starts now.

2668
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,560
Let's go.

2669
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,680
What the hell?

2670
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,000
Revenant cracked.

2671
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,760
Cracked to all this.

2672
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:39,000
Save them.

2673
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,920
Okay guys, I have a proposal.

2674
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:51,960
If we win the next three games, we can leave early because nobody will be first place after that.

2675
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,480
Okay, okay.

2676
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:04,540
Yeah, I'm just saying, if we win all three in a row, we could literally leave and don't have to play the seventh game and still be first.

2677
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,800
I feel like that's the strat, guys.

2678
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,380
I'm okay with that.

2679
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,060
Oh, Lehman.

2680
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:19,680
What the fuck?

2681
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:31,910
Oh, of course there's a fucking second player!

2682
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:33,730
Why am I always getting thirded?

2683
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:38,490
I hope you die.

2684
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:51,170
First place team in game three got 13... 18 kills?

2685
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:52,310
Jeez, that's crazy.

2686
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:56,770
It's always like, one team that... it's just one team that gets like all the kills.

2687
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:58,230
Choked.

2688
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:02,090
Wait, bring it on.

2689
01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:05,410
Wait, is second place getting kills or what?

2690
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:09,410
Second place gets... there is prizes for second place too.

2691
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:10,270
Wait, let me double check.

2692
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,370
Wait, did I die?

2693
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:12,030
Did my team die?

2694
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:12,830
Okay, I can re-kill.

2695
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:19,210
Let's see, where the fuck is the... second... okay, second place is a hundred dollars each player.

2696
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:22,850
First place is a hundred and seventy-five dollars per player.

2697
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:25,670
And then third place is fifty dollars per player.

2698
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:27,850
Oh, W.

2699
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:30,410
Yeah, so we could get W.

2700
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:35,410
Yeah, I got shooting.

2701
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:35,630
What the fuck, man?

2702
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:39,930
Oh yeah, Dragon's team got first place, by the way.

2703
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:41,950
Okay, not good.

2704
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:46,030
Bro, Chiller's here.

2705
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:48,970
Yeah, fuck me.

2706
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:50,950
Wait, fourth round is starting soon?

2707
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:52,850
There's no way, the lobby code isn't even out.

2708
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:54,170
Don't lie to us.

2709
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,910
Is it the same lobby code?

2710
01:32:58,530 --> 01:32:59,010
Help.

2711
01:32:59,610 --> 01:33:01,790
You literally told us there's gonna be an intermission.

2712
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:08,720
So are we playing?

2713
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:09,580
No intermission?

2714
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,600
I don't know.

2715
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,560
I feel like we'd get added if there was...

2716
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,920
No, no, uh, people don't know yet.

2717
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:23,940
Oh, they're doing team interviews, so yeah, it's gonna take like fucking forever.

2718
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:24,600
Oh shit.

2719
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:30,070
Do you really trust chat?

2720
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:30,750
Of course not.

2721
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:32,310
Only when they're backseating me.

2722
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:41,570
Yeah, no, they're saying that there is a 30 minute intermission right now.

2723
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:43,530
So we're back.

2724
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:44,930
That's like two ranked games.

2725
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:46,970
Yeah.

2726
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:48,830
And like six pubs.

2727
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:53,030
Six pubs is crazy.

2728
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:02,550
Oh, I

2729
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:11,530
got that.

2730
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,360
We aren't gonna interview?

2731
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:18,500
What the fuck would I say in the interview chat?

2732
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:19,960
We're sick.

2733
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:23,880
You're like, I don't know what.

2734
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,680
We're sick and we don't know what we're doing.

2735
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,120
I'm left.

2736
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:31,680
I don't exist.

2737
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,260
I'm not here.

2738
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:42,070
All right, down we go.

2739
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:45,210
I'm left.

2740
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:45,210
I don't exist.

2741
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:45,210
I'm not here.

2742
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:47,490
How did you.

2743
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:50,610
Oh yeah, I could chill in my fucking sponsor code.

2744
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:56,490
Just give me a gun.

2745
01:34:56,970 --> 01:34:57,370
Kill.

2746
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,230
I knocked the path.

2747
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:01,130
There's no way which hate, bro.

2748
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:02,770
Oh my god.

2749
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,310
Can I step on here?

2750
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:05,230
Yeah.

2751
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:06,770
Wait.

2752
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:08,550
They're below you, there's an enemy team.

2753
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:11,970
Oh, it was them?

2754
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:12,530
What the fuck?

2755
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:12,970
It's you're.

2756
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:14,570
Oh, fuck.

2757
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:15,190
Oh.

2758
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:15,950
I got naded from this way.

2759
01:35:16,390 --> 01:35:17,730
No, no, no, I'm dead, bro.

2760
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:18,190
Okay.

2761
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:20,030
Why, man?

2762
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:21,210
I'm getting naded.

2763
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:21,490
No!

2764
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:23,810
You sure you're dead?

2765
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:24,810
Yeah, I believe in unlucky.

2766
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:27,250
Bro's dead.

2767
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:29,090
I'm dead.

2768
01:35:29,730 --> 01:35:31,190
Bro, what the... why did he just...

2769
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:31,450
Oh, okay.

2770
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,210
You wanna know what's our teammate's name is?

2771
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:41,130
That he's shooting with the REA.

2772
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:43,010
What?

2773
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:47,570
No!

2774
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:48,530
No, this guy...

2775
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:49,890
What, Eager?

2776
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:51,710
What the fuck are you doing?

2777
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:53,330
There's no...

2778
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:56,370
Oh, now you fucking play with me?

2779
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:58,050
What the fuck is that guy?

2780
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:00,070
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2781
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:03,170
Oh, it's a shooter, by the way.

2782
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:03,630
The lobby's shooting.

2783
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:05,290
You got me?

2784
01:36:05,650 --> 01:36:06,170
Yeah.

2785
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:14,590
Probably you.

2786
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:16,690
Watch your back.

2787
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:18,150
I won't always be around.

2788
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:19,390
Upgraded.

2789
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:19,590
Ah.

2790
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:26,300
Upgraded.

2791
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:32,270
Alright, I'm gonna walk you down.

2792
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:34,850
It's the plan of the sieg legging, bro.

2793
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:35,750
What do you mean?

2794
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:37,730
It's just so goofy.

2795
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:39,270
Wait, one got knocked.

2796
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:42,370
Yeah, the guy you knocked already knocked.

2797
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:43,710
Bro, find a mob at res.

2798
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:44,230
Come on.

2799
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:45,850
There's no mob anywhere.

2800
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:55,180
Yeah, it's a shooter.

2801
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:57,700
Yes, full kill him.

2802
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:58,920
He knocked one of the other team too.

2803
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:00,460
Get the shooter on the right.

2804
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,020
Fuck him up.

2805
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:12,520
No, fuck him up.

2806
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,020
Onefino.

2807
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:16,320
And why this one got far right?

2808
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,240
It's your word.

2809
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:23,540
Alright, I muted... I muted my old Discord.

2810
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:25,720
We'll hear them, but I wanna talk to you guys.

2811
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:30,420
Dad is at babysat... Dad is getting babysat right now.

2812
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,200
Because I can't take care of a dog at the moment.

2813
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,020
So...

2814
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:41,860
I can't take care of dogs at the moment.

2815
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,440
So he's getting babysat.

2816
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,100
The worst part was that when I gave him to the...

2817
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,700
I found a babysitter at the very last minute.

2818
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,280
It was very expensive.

2819
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:53,360
But I literally could not take care of a dog in my condition.

2820
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,440
And I gave the leash to the babysitter and he didn't look back.

2821
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,520
I was so...

2822
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,980
He just left.

2823
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:06,360
He just kept walking.

2824
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,460
I was so fucking sad.

2825
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,960
I was like, alright, here you go.

2826
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:15,780
Here's the leash.

2827
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:17,900
And he was so happy because it was a lady.

2828
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:18,980
I made sure it was a lady.

2829
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:24,540
I made sure it was a woman that's babysitting him.

2830
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,920
And then I gave... like, you know...

2831
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:30,180
He saw... he saw the lady and he was so happy.

2832
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:31,520
He was like, Yippee!

2833
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:32,180
Woman!

2834
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,880
And like jumped on her.

2835
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,040
He was like, I love woman!

2836
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:41,340
And then...

2837
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,800
And then he fucking...

2838
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,420
He like...

2839
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:47,060
I gave the leash to her and then he didn't look back.

2840
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,380
He didn't even look at me.

2841
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:49,600
He didn't...

2842
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,660
He didn't even look at me.

2843
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:55,260
He just walked away.

2844
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,260
He literally...

2845
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:00,800
He literally just walked away.

2846
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,180
I'm just like...

2847
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:04,860
Oh my god.

2848
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,520
I was like, I guess...

2849
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:19,320
She is a lady, that's for sure.

2850
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,400
What the fuck is this guy doing?

2851
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,600
That is such a womanizer.

2852
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:31,260
I didn't think the shield came back that fast.

2853
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:34,600
So yeah, that's the life update.

2854
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,160
So far.

2855
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:39,300
He is now at the babysitter.

2856
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,420
Wait, what the fuck?

2857
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:44,380
Oh fuck, okay.

2858
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:48,160
Oh god, my fucking sick...

2859
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,660
Oh my sick aim!

2860
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,420
Where is my octane?

2861
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,320
Please, I got him so low.

2862
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,640
Oh no!

2863
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,180
Anyway, so that's the update.

2864
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,540
That's the...

2865
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:08,280
That's the update for my life at the moment.

2866
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:11,580
The...

2867
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:15,340
And then I got sent updates and then the owner...

2868
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:16,840
Sorry, I'm the owner.

2869
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,540
The babysitter texted me an update today.

2870
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,440
She's been giving me updates the last three days.

2871
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:29,200
And then today I got an update from the babysitter.

2872
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,600
And then he was like...

2873
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,860
She was like...

2874
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:33,720
Oh my god.

2875
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:34,420
He was...

2876
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:36,400
He was such a...

2877
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,480
Say Stariboh.

2878
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:38,820
Stariboh.

2879
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:39,840
Stariboh.

2880
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:40,860
Stariboh.

2881
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:43,260
What the fuck does that mean?

2882
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,120
Nothing.

2883
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,620
Can you say it again?

2884
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:48,300
What?

2885
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:48,800
How do you say it?

2886
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:49,940
Stariboh.

2887
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:50,740
Stariboh.

2888
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:52,440
Stariboh.

2889
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,160
Stariboh.

2890
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:53,460
Stariboh.

2891
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:54,600
What?

2892
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,880
What does it mean?

2893
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,120
It's just like a streamer.

2894
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:00,160
He says it all the time.

2895
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:00,720
He says...

2896
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,120
Don't say that.

2897
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:02,900
It's like a big meme in Dota.

2898
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:05,060
Stariboh.

2899
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:06,180
Don't say that, you're gonna get banned.

2900
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:06,640
Jocked.

2901
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,440
Yeah, am I gonna get banned?

2902
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:08,840
Am I gonna get banned?

2903
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,720
Guys, anyone that knows...

2904
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,240
Is that Russian?

2905
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:14,700
Yeah, it is.

2906
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,700
Any Russians in my chat, what the fuck does it mean?

2907
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:19,700
We just insulted everyone.

2908
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:21,580
I'm sorry.

2909
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,760
This is a fix fall.

2910
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:23,700
If it's an insult.

2911
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:25,680
If it's not, then like...

2912
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:25,940
Yay.

2913
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:26,460
Stariboh.

2914
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:28,180
Wave that.

2915
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,120
One guy bomb left and that guy's like...

2916
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,640
I got put down.

2917
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:40,460
Okay, so like, basically, anyway, it's a game, there's no way, there's no way it's a game.

2918
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,280
Anyway, anyway, so...

2919
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,800
Yeah, the gold of playing out of a list, oh my god.

2920
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:46,620
Anyway, what was I gonna say?

2921
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:52,040
Okay, so, she gave me an update and was like, hey, so...

2922
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:57,380
So he was a really, okay, I'm gonna be frozen for a bit, guys.

2923
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,180
I need to reread the text.

2924
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:02,220
I was so, like, I was like, are you serious?

2925
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:05,000
He was an angel overnight.

2926
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,760
Very quiet.

2927
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:11,280
And I was like, is this the same fucking dog?

2928
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,120
Very quiet.

2929
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,240
He's such a cutie and very playful.

2930
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:27,620
I am loving having him here.

2931
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,420
It's okay.

2932
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:33,860
Fucking women.

2933
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:38,700
That's the opposite.

2934
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,940
This Brad talk.

2935
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:56,380
Betrayed.

2936
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,040
I can't believe it.

2937
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,740
Bro, what am I doing?

2938
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:08,400
I just, I'm just thinking, are we clearly talking about the same fucking dog?

2939
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,540
You have some strangers for me?

2940
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,580
No, he's not gonna like the male babysitters.

2941
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:15,860
He fucking hates men.

2942
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:21,220
He only, he only likes women to take care of him.

2943
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:27,660
Fucking, God, fucking, I can't believe it.

2944
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:30,340
When I got that text, I was like, are you, what?

2945
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,320
Is this the same fucking dog?

2946
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,800
Like, did they, did they swap dogs?

2947
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,500
Like, what do you mean?

2948
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,160
He wasn't, he was very quiet.

2949
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:44,120
That part fucking confused the shit out of me.

2950
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:47,520
Because if anything, that is not quiet.

2951
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:50,020
He is not fucking quiet at all.

2952
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:51,460
My controls, do you see it?

2953
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:54,280
So I was like, he was quiet.

2954
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,160
And I was like, excuse me?

2955
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:57,180
Like...

2956
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,420
I'm gonna push your castle.

2957
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,200
Excuse me?

2958
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:01,920
Okay, I'm choosing the Angela.

2959
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:03,020
Is someone else on you, by the way?

2960
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:04,120
Yep.

2961
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:05,760
Alright.

2962
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,060
I love my dog.

2963
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,260
But just sometimes.

2964
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:12,860
Ooh, sometimes.

2965
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:14,380
Oh no, mental pookie.

2966
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,280
Sometimes.

2967
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:18,200
Ooh.

2968
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:21,160
Yeah.

2969
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,000
He's just, he's just shy.

2970
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:25,820
No, he was so happy.

2971
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,260
He was so fucking happy.

2972
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:30,680
I literally was like...

2973
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:34,340
I literally like gave the babysitter a leash.

2974
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,640
And then he like never looked back at me.

2975
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,320
He just left.

2976
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,720
Literally just kept going forward.

2977
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,800
I was like...

2978
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,460
I looked at him to see if he'll walk...

2979
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:50,580
Like, you know, I want to see if he'll at least look at me.

2980
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:51,500
But he didn't.

2981
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,500
He didn't even look at me.

2982
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:55,640
That was the worst part.

2983
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:56,260
Like...

2984
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,660
I would have accepted him looking at me at least once.

2985
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:02,380
But he didn't.

2986
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,000
That was...

2987
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,520
That hurt, guys.

2988
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:05,940
That actually hurt.

2989
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:07,020
Yes, sir.

2990
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:08,240
He just whipped it out.

2991
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:09,180
Huh?

2992
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:10,080
You want to punch him?

2993
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:10,440
Come here.

2994
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,540
He was so scared.

2995
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:12,960
One, two, three.

2996
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,340
He was wagging his tail.

2997
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:16,760
Anyway.

2998
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,500
That's my life update.

2999
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,700
I can't take care of any...

3000
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,240
I can barely take care of myself at the moment.

3001
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:28,580
I'm so fucked up.

3002
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,320
I literally...

3003
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:33,940
For the Pico Park 2 collab, I was playing with a headache.

3004
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,500
But I was trying...

3005
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,340
But I didn't want to reschedule it.

3006
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,040
Because it was with a lot of people.

3007
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:40,920
You know?

3008
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,940
So I felt really bad rescheduling it.

3009
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:46,860
Because a lot of people gave up their time to play today.

3010
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:48,120
But like...

3011
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:48,660
Oh, my God.

3012
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:49,420
I was so...

3013
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:51,740
I was so...

3014
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,660
I was not okay.

3015
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,240
Like...

3016
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,520
I know it didn't seem like it.

3017
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:58,920
It might not have seemed like it.

3018
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:02,820
But I had a headache by the end.

3019
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:03,280
Yeah.

3020
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:05,540
Yeah.

3021
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:07,920
I went outside too much.

3022
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,340
You know?

3023
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,380
During my going outside character arc.

3024
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,400
I went outside a little bit too much.

3025
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:15,180
Oh, that guy's a bot.

3026
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:21,480
I'm just going to kill this guy.

3027
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:22,820
He's AFK.

3028
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:23,440
That poor guy.

3029
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:23,640
I'm just going to kill this guy.

3030
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:25,040
I don't think he's even going to try and res him.

3031
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:27,440
Is he actually going to even try to res this guy?

3032
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,020
Hello.

3033
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:30,500
Why?

3034
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,080
Okay.

3035
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:33,180
That's free loot at least.

3036
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:35,640
Has he even looted?

3037
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:36,420
Oh, he has.

3038
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,700
He just was AFK for that one moment.

3039
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:39,520
That was so sad.

3040
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,080
He was just...

3041
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,840
He just had to be AFK today.

3042
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:43,780
I am so bad.

3043
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:46,160
Poor guy.

3044
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:46,860
Am I pushing you?

3045
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:49,020
How does he see me in smoke?

3046
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,060
I'm on your right.

3047
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,220
Poor guy.

3048
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:53,620
I'm on your right.

3049
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,300
No, I just, I just, I have to go.

3050
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,560
I think, I don't know what got me sick.

3051
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,300
It could be anything, honestly.

3052
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:07,440
It could be anything that got me sick because like I was doing so much stuff in general.

3053
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:14,220
I had to do a lot of things today.

3054
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:15,440
Not today.

3055
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:18,060
I mean like over the weeks that got me sick.

3056
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:21,980
Oh, he died to another team.

3057
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:22,460
Yeah.

3058
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:22,540
Yeah.

3059
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:26,780
So like, uh, so that, I don't know.

3060
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:27,640
I don't know.

3061
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:28,360
It could be in anything.

3062
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:29,440
I went outside a lot.

3063
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,180
I had to go to the vet.

3064
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,640
I had to go to the vet.

3065
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:32,760
I had to do banking stuff.

3066
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:38,800
Um, I had to go outside for, uh, for a meeting.

3067
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:42,480
I could, I'm also like incredibly stressed too.

3068
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:45,580
So like, and really overworked in general.

3069
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,940
So it could be that as well.

3070
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:52,260
So like that like kills your immune system when you're, when you're like...

3071
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:55,660
Uh, when you're like stressed and overworked, cause I'm like always working.

3072
01:47:56,860 --> 01:47:58,380
I'm always working.

3073
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:06,880
Tell your boss I am my own boss and I'm not in my, and as a boss, we're not taking a break.

3074
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:07,780
We're just gaming.

3075
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:11,620
No breaks, no breaks for me.

3076
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:14,260
Oh, okay.

3077
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:14,940
That's fine.

3078
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,180
I'll just throw this nade in.

3079
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:16,940
Yup.

3080
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,060
That's fucking right.

3081
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:18,400
Oh my.

3082
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:19,320
That's a Loba.

3083
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,040
She might be sus.

3084
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,640
No damage.

3085
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:23,280
I'm fine.

3086
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:24,760
I think too.

3087
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:26,820
It's fucking right.

3088
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,060
My house now.

3089
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:29,880
Wait, what?

3090
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:32,460
This was supposed to be my house.

3091
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,020
What the fuck is going on?

3092
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:37,720
My, my reaction is not good right now.

3093
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,780
It's like super noticeable.

3094
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,160
My reaction is so slow.

3095
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,000
So much better, bro.

3096
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:48,700
Rabbit, bro.

3097
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:49,980
The fuck is rabbit?

3098
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:50,020
Rabbit.

3099
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:50,380
Rabbit, bro.

3100
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,140
I have such a slow reaction.

3101
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:52,900
Oh, man.

3102
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:55,340
Fucking rabbit.

3103
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,760
You are not good in Apex.

3104
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:58,880
Hey.

3105
01:48:59,020 --> 01:48:59,360
Oh.

3106
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:00,680
Wait a second.

3107
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:02,900
Chad, you're not good in Apex.

3108
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:06,400
To your ass.

3109
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:08,800
Bro, why is my chat is in German now?

3110
01:49:09,160 --> 01:49:09,980
Wait, what?

3111
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:11,800
What?

3112
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:15,540
Why is it in German?

3113
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:17,880
Oh, fuck.

3114
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:20,020
I canceled my heal because you said that.

3115
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:21,860
I was so surprised.

3116
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:25,680
Okay.

3117
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,100
How long do you have still?

3118
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,620
I have no idea.

3119
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:36,480
Chad, how long do we have till we get to play the game?

3120
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,040
Time for an app.

3121
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:39,740
Wait.

3122
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,020
Apparently, you said something in German.

3123
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:41,580
That's why.

3124
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:42,920
What the fuck did you say?

3125
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:43,760
You're so multilingual.

3126
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:45,820
What?

3127
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:46,720
Multilingual?

3128
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:49,400
Apparently, Apex said something in German.

3129
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:49,980
Oh, shit.

3130
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:51,820
No, I got fucking destroyed.

3131
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:54,200
Chad, cancel.

3132
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:00,080
Wait,

3133
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:04,680
in fact, how many languages do you know?

3134
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:06,060
Only two.

3135
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:07,180
All of them.

3136
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:08,240
All of them.

3137
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:12,020
Nah, only two and a bit from different languages.

3138
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,620
Wait, what do you know from different languages?

3139
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,240
Apparently, there's two mids left.

3140
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:16,840
Random wars.

3141
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:17,560
Like what?

3142
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,220
Random wars.

3143
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:19,960
Random wars.

3144
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:21,600
Like what?

3145
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:22,120
Say one.

3146
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:23,580
No.

3147
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:24,580
Why not?

3148
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,100
What the fuck does that mean?

3149
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:28,480
I don't know.

3150
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:30,220
It's in German.

3151
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,100
Things that love you.

3152
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:35,580
I don't think that's what it means, though.

3153
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:36,520
He said it.

3154
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:37,760
It does.

3155
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:38,420
Okay.

3156
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,040
It does.

3157
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:39,480
Wait.

3158
01:50:39,740 --> 01:50:40,820
How would you know?

3159
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:41,540
You're not German.

3160
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:43,180
He's German.

3161
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:43,580
I am.

3162
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:44,120
I am.

3163
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:44,180
Wait.

3164
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:44,360
You are?

3165
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:45,020
Wait.

3166
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:45,520
You're German?

3167
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:46,320
Wait.

3168
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:46,660
Let me.

3169
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:48,460
Clearly, I didn't read the right Wikipedia.

3170
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,200
Okay.

3171
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:49,960
Okay.

3172
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:50,980
What the hell?

3173
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:53,740
They speak German in Austria.

3174
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:54,820
Oh yeah, dude.

3175
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:55,840
Oh, you're Austrian.

3176
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:57,300
I was like you're not German.

3177
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:59,420
They speak German there.

3178
01:50:59,420 --> 01:50:59,700
Yeah, yeah.

3179
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,080
I forgot.

3180
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,680
They speak German in Austria.

3181
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:02,980
You're not German.

3182
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,300
You're not from Germany.

3183
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:05,880
Okay.

3184
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:05,900
Love it.

3185
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:09,860
Sorry.

3186
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:15,520
I just knew you weren't from Germany, so that was like you're not German, but I forgot you're Austrian.

3187
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:18,600
That's okay.

3188
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:19,960
I'm a parent.

3189
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,620
The very word in German is Gänsehalsen.

3190
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:22,980
What does that mean?

3191
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:24,520
It means goosebumps from balls, bro.

3192
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,260
Goosebumps from balls?

3193
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,420
Yeah, goosebumps on your balls.

3194
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:30,980
Oh my god.

3195
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:32,980
How did you learn that word?

3196
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:34,600
I don't know.

3197
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:35,880
No, you know.

3198
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:36,500
You know how.

3199
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,860
Did you teach him these words?

3200
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,220
No.

3201
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,320
No, I taught him these words.

3202
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:49,180
That's the thing.

3203
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:49,900
I taught him.

3204
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:50,380
Yeah.

3205
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:54,160
Oh man.

3206
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,820
Maybe Effect is a bad influence.

3207
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:56,860
Maybe.

3208
01:51:58,440 --> 01:51:59,100
That's crazy.

3209
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:03,520
Who the fuck is Rario in the chat, bro?

3210
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:05,100
Rario?

3211
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:06,680
I don't know.

3212
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:08,700
Goat.

3213
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:10,420
Yeah.

3214
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,420
Oh, somebody wrote it for me.

3215
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:14,900
Gänsehalsen?

3216
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:16,120
How do you pronounce it?

3217
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:20,940
Gänsehalsen.

3218
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:21,040
That's good.

3219
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:23,280
How do you pronounce that?

3220
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:24,740
Gänsehalsen.

3221
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:27,260
Gänsehalsen.

3222
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:29,380
Is that goosebumps on your balls?

3223
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:30,580
Yeah.

3224
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:32,520
Damn.

3225
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:34,800
So what is the context?

3226
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,040
What context?

3227
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:38,220
Just say it randomly.

3228
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:42,140
There's no meaning.

3229
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:44,300
Yup.

3230
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,340
That's context.

3231
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:46,520
Yeah.

3232
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,040
You guys don't have Gänsehalsen?

3233
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:54,400
It's not a common thing.

3234
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:56,220
Sometimes you just get goosebumps.

3235
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:56,680
Yeah.

3236
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:58,560
On your balls.

3237
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,320
You're so scared, you just get it on the balls.

3238
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:02,800
Yeah.

3239
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:04,900
Experienced that already.

3240
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,360
Just got so much use.

3241
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:10,940
Exactly.

3242
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:12,940
You can use it every day.

3243
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:14,400
Damn.

3244
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:18,920
How many languages do you know?

3245
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:19,380
How many languages do I know?

3246
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:30,780
Well, okay, I know English, Chinese, French, and then I used to know a little bit of Korean, but I don't anymore because I don't, like, practice it.

3247
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:32,720
A lot.

3248
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:34,240
Yeah, but I...

3249
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,520
I've learned Japanese and Chinese, too.

3250
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:37,720
Oh, Chinese is really hard to learn.

3251
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:38,600
Yeah.

3252
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:40,900
How's your Japanese?

3253
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:42,180
Oh, he says YouTube into Japan!

3254
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:43,220
How is it?

3255
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:46,740
Well, I'll learn it one day.

3256
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,100
It was good.

3257
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:48,840
It was good.

3258
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:52,660
Yeah, what do you guys do in Japan other than the Tokyo Game Show?

3259
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:54,060
Intercourse.

3260
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,340
Oh, shit!

3261
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:55,940
With each other?

3262
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:58,240
No, uh, yeah.

3263
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:04,720
I'm not letting it anymore, it's crazy.

3264
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:07,700
Oh my god.

3265
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:08,420
I am hiding it.

3266
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,140
I'll join the team later.

3267
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:14,680
That's why he joined Alliance, right?

3268
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,620
So you guys can get closer.

3269
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:18,020
Yeah, it was dark.

3270
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:19,060
It was dark.

3271
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:20,160
Hard to tell who was who.

3272
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:22,220
Oh, shit.

3273
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:25,080
I don't know, maybe it was Pontus, maybe it was Effect.

3274
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:25,620
I don't know.

3275
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:26,700
Wow!

3276
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,200
That's why you guys work so well together, you know?

3277
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:33,640
In bed and out of bed.

3278
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:34,700
Yeah.

3279
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,840
That's where the dick in the ass comes from.

3280
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,040
Wait, who's the...

3281
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:41,480
Who's the top?

3282
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,240
Huh.

3283
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,400
Who's the more dominant one?

3284
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,980
It's getting kind of freaky out here, alright?

3285
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:52,140
It's getting kind of freaky.

3286
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:53,580
I got Gensokun.

3287
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:55,420
Gensokun's the same, bro.

3288
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,980
That wasn't the one that started this conversation.

3289
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:01,040
I literally asked him about Japan.

3290
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,220
I literally asked him about Japan.

3291
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:04,340
Somebody else.

3292
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:08,200
Somebody else decided to bring in your relationship with each other.

3293
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:09,260
Somebody else decided to bring in your relationship with each other.

3294
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,320
Somebody else decided to bring in your relationship with each other.

3295
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:13,060
I think it should be starting soon, by the way.

3296
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:14,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3297
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:16,300
You should pay attention to that, right?

3298
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:17,360
Yeah.

3299
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:21,440
Not the other stuff that was just leaked out.

3300
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:25,020
But, like, he's your bro, you know?

3301
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,240
You gotta do what bros gotta do.

3302
01:55:27,060 --> 01:55:27,540
Yeah.

3303
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,800
Just bro things, no homo.

3304
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:30,160
Yeah.

3305
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,140
Yeah, it's just bro things.

3306
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,840
People with no bros don't understand, right?

3307
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:38,600
People with no bros don't understand, right?

3308
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:41,180
Oh, shit.

3309
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,140
Oh, shit.

3310
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,040
Only bros understand.

3311
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:46,960
Only bros understand.

3312
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:48,860
Huh?

3313
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:49,160
Huh?

3314
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:51,160
Are you serious?

3315
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:54,720
Wait.

3316
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:58,400
Okay, so, like, my chat wants to ask you guys.

3317
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:58,760
Okay, so, like, my chat wants to ask you guys.

3318
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:01,100
If one of you guys got bit by a snake...

3319
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:02,320
Yeah.

3320
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,280
Would the other suck the...

3321
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:07,960
I already knew the question, dude.

3322
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:10,400
Okay, so, in fact, we'll do it.

3323
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:11,560
But would you do it, unlucky?

3324
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,880
Oh, you have to think about it.

3325
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:16,740
That's crazy.

3326
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:20,520
I had to swallow my water.

3327
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:20,980
You hesitated.

3328
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:22,140
You had to hesitate.

3329
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,460
Dude, that's crazy.

3330
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:24,940
No, I was swallowing.

3331
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,620
Oh, you swallow?

3332
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:28,640
Yeah, I was swallowing.

3333
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,240
What the fuck?

3334
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,580
That's getting freaking freaker.

3335
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:35,900
Oh, my God.

3336
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:36,140
What do you mean?

3337
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:37,340
You started it.

3338
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,580
You literally started it.

3339
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:40,120
I did not start it at all.

3340
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:42,380
I only said I had intercourse.

3341
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:45,460
I said the most family-friendly sentence ever.

3342
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,280
That's not family-friendly.

3343
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,220
What do you mean?

3344
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:50,860
It is.

3345
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:52,320
Intercourse.

3346
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:58,860
I literally was asking how was Japan and then you started it off the best.

3347
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:00,560
I always add intercourse.

3348
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:01,440
That's all I add.

3349
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:06,100
Damn, that's freaky.

3350
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:11,720
Damn, I can't believe unlucky is so freaky, guys.

3351
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:15,280
He's so freaky.

3352
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:16,780
Freaky hunter.

3353
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:17,560
Yeah, yeah.

3354
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:19,580
Yeah, bro.

3355
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:21,420
Oh, God.

3356
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:23,680
I can't hate, man.

3357
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:27,740
Damn.

3358
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,240
The freakiest, bro.

3359
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,380
Am I getting dragged or what?

3360
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:34,020
Bro, it's just your style of game.

3361
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,560
Oh, I don't wanna...

3362
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:38,360
What the fuck?

3363
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:39,240
Whoa!

3364
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:44,320
Okay.

3365
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:44,820
Oh, my God.

3366
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,380
Wait, is the lobby out?

3367
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:49,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3368
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:50,440
Oh, shit.

3369
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:50,840
Oh, cool.

3370
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:50,940
Fuck it.

3371
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:52,580
Okay, it's just me.

3372
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:53,520
Okay, I'll...

3373
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,080
Where's my teammate?

3374
01:57:58,600 --> 01:57:59,260
Please!

3375
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,280
Oh, he was one HP.

3376
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,240
That's why.

3377
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,680
That's why he's unlucky.

3378
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:15,760
Damn.

3379
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:16,960
Damn.

3380
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:20,340
Unlucky is the freakiest person I know.

3381
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,720
And I just met him today.

3382
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:26,040
Wait, am I the only one missing?

3383
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:26,860
Oh, shit.

3384
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,760
Goodbye, Pathfinder.

3385
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:28,120
No.

3386
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:28,460
Oh, wait, I'm not?

3387
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:29,180
Okay, I'll keep playing.

3388
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,920
Why can't I just be dragged?

3389
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:33,120
Like, why is there just no one dragging me?

3390
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:34,080
Bro!

3391
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:35,600
You gotta drag yourself!

3392
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:37,900
Damn.

3393
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:38,940
Don't be lazy.

3394
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:45,160
What about me?

3395
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:45,760
No, no.

3396
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:47,840
Unlucky is so freaky, you guys.

3397
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:51,060
Effect can vouch.

3398
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,100
Is Unlucky the most freakiest pro you've ever known?

3399
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:55,420
He is freaky, bro.

3400
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:56,220
Oh, shit.

3401
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,220
Like, how freaky?

3402
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,460
Well, they're like...

3403
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:01,000
The freakiest person I know.

3404
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:02,320
Oh, like, give me an example.

3405
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:09,620
You have to say, yeah, and then not give receipts, you know?

3406
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:11,260
Hell not.

3407
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,640
There's too many things I don't know.

3408
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,140
There's too many things I don't know.

3409
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,120
Bro, he literally got banned on Twitch for moaning.

3410
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:21,460
Bro, he literally got banned on Twitch for moaning.

3411
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:21,980
What?

3412
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:24,700
Did you actually?

3413
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,480
Did you actually?

3414
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:28,360
That's not how it went.

3415
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,480
For my defense, no.

3416
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:33,000
I was 17 when that happened.

3417
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:33,780
I was 17.

3418
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:38,260
That's why I got banned.

3419
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:40,040
That's why I got banned.

3420
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:42,440
That doesn't make it better.

3421
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,040
That doesn't make it better.

3422
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:45,520
Because you have mine.

3423
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:46,920
Nah, I'm going toilet.

3424
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:52,240
I'm disconnecting myself from this conversation.

3425
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:54,760
Bye-bye, I'm going toilet.

3426
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,800
It makes it worse, it makes it better.

3427
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:01,020
It doesn't make it better if you're under 8.

3428
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:03,440
Oh my god.

3429
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:04,380
That's crazy.

3430
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:06,560
That's actually crazy.

3431
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:08,820
You're the only one missing, Ducky.

3432
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,300
Oh my god.

3433
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:12,080
Oh, I'm the only one missing?

3434
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:12,540
Okay.

3435
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:13,120
Yeah.

3436
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:15,100
Alright, I leave.

3437
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:15,900
I'm so sorry.

3438
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,180
Don't worry, Roman Lettuce.

3439
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:22,280
I'll give you this shield, and then I'm gonna die here in this corner.

3440
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:25,040
I'm sorry, I have to go.

3441
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:28,180
Alright.

3442
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:31,800
Where's the code?

3443
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:33,680
Where is it?

3444
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:34,740
Lobby?

3445
02:00:34,820 --> 02:00:35,700
Oh, is it the same code?

3446
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:36,740
Oh, it is.

3447
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:37,060
Yeah.

3448
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,520
Okay.

3449
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:41,420
Okay, I can just do that.

3450
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:42,080
There you go.

3451
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,060
Oh, I was the last one.

3452
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:46,280
It's Teddy Reckless.

3453
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:48,460
Teddy Reckless.

3454
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:51,920
I wasn't the last one.

3455
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:53,960
Teddy Reckless just got in.

3456
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:58,200
Okay, after that conversation, we should be so locked in after that.

3457
02:00:59,040 --> 02:00:59,600
Yup.

3458
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:06,680
He should be, like, ready to ready to frag.

3459
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:10,640
With his freaky with his freakiness.

3460
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:14,640
I wonder what he's doing in the bathroom right now.

3461
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,600
What do you mean by that?

3462
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:21,720
Oh, he leaves all of a sudden.

3463
02:01:21,980 --> 02:01:22,960
Oh, he leaves all of a sudden.

3464
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:24,580
Gotta relieve some stress, right?

3465
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:25,760
Yeah.

3466
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,720
Gotta pee the stress out, right?

3467
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:31,540
You're just saying that.

3468
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:32,880
That's what you mean, right?

3469
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:34,480
Yup.

3470
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,800
Hope he come back by the time.

3471
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:38,640
Yeah, I hope so.

3472
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:40,120
Hope he pees fast.

3473
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,420
Okay, we're playing...

3474
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:47,800
Okay, I'm still on...

3475
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,780
He's getting freaky.

3476
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:50,060
He's getting...

3477
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:53,880
Having...

3478
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,380
I'm back from my toilet adventure.

3479
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:59,840
I'm ready to poop on other people now, not only my toilet.

3480
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,360
Why did it take you so long in the bathroom?

3481
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:03,100
Cause I had to take a shit.

3482
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:06,180
Yeah, that's what you call it now?

3483
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:07,120
Yeah, that's what you call it?

3484
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,360
Alright.

3485
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:12,260
That was that fast?

3486
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:13,080
I'mma keep it real?

3487
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:13,720
That was...

3488
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:14,380
That was pretty good.

3489
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:19,380
Alright.

3490
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:20,920
Let's go.

3491
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:22,880
I don't even know where we're landing.

3492
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:23,640
How we're landing, actually.

3493
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:26,180
We're doing... We're devastated, Coast.

3494
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:27,400
Oh, yeah.

3495
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,680
Right side is Dragon's team.

3496
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:33,840
Left side is I don't know who, but Dragon's team is currently first place.

3497
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:36,380
Calm.

3498
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:39,800
Freaky bird.

3499
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:41,680
Freak fat and unfreaky.

3500
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,420
No, he's the most...

3501
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:44,260
What do you mean?

3502
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:47,040
Oh, man.

3503
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,360
Okay, I'm looting.

3504
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:49,160
I'm looting top.

3505
02:02:49,540 --> 02:02:50,020
Alright.

3506
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:50,580
Okay.

3507
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:52,780
I'm looting south-east, I guess.

3508
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:54,460
Waiting the UV or what?

3509
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:56,080
Oh, I loot.

3510
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,260
I loot here?

3511
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:00,320
Question mark?

3512
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:00,760
Yeah.

3513
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:01,260
Yeah.

3514
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,220
You should get nothing.

3515
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:07,300
And freaky is for the irony.

3516
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,040
Oh, man.

3517
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,640
That's gonna be what you're known for.

3518
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:14,020
For the rest of your life.

3519
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:16,220
Oh, wow.

3520
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:18,140
That's something I came proud of.

3521
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:18,740
Yeah.

3522
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,120
Yeah, man.

3523
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:24,920
Be up.

3524
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:28,120
Okay.

3525
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:32,420
Alright, I'm running Carbine.

3526
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:34,520
Carbine, Mozambique.

3527
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:35,700
Yippee.

3528
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,140
Very good.

3529
02:03:37,620 --> 02:03:40,500
I have double Mozambique, but I can't...

3530
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:40,980
Oh, yeah.

3531
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:46,580
Yeah, I should change my team name to Freaky at LAN.

3532
02:03:49,180 --> 02:03:52,540
Can we request a name change?

3533
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:53,920
A team name change.

3534
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:55,920
Real quick.

3535
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:03,940
We got no cash.

3536
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:05,600
Let's go, baby.

3537
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:06,640
We have nothing.

3538
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:07,360
Let's go.

3539
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:09,120
I have nothing.

3540
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:09,980
It's okay.

3541
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:11,580
We can get...

3542
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:12,700
We can win something.

3543
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:17,340
We can get first place here in this map with this drop spot.

3544
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:18,300
Yeah.

3545
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:19,180
Have shit.

3546
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:19,480
Have shit.

3547
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:22,780
First launch by that.

3548
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:26,120
There's an evac here if anyone wants it.

3549
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:27,980
I have...

3550
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:30,360
Cracked an enemy shield.

3551
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:30,720
Back one.

3552
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:33,640
Reloading.

3553
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:36,200
They're gonna come now because I was beefing with them.

3554
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:37,400
Oh, shit.

3555
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:39,680
They're gonna come in the course of us.

3556
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:43,420
I'm gonna loot this bin and we'll get plus 50.

3557
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:45,420
Resm's finger.

3558
02:04:45,740 --> 02:04:47,280
There's a lot of bats here.

3559
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:48,040
I'll take these.

3560
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:52,820
Try to get one tapped.

3561
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:55,700
You wanna go around right side or...

3562
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:55,980
Sure.

3563
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:57,420
There's a bat here.

3564
02:04:58,300 --> 02:04:59,680
And more shield cells.

3565
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:02,300
They maybe wanna fight.

3566
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:09,400
I think they want to because if they win the 50-50, they're gonna be our last threat.

3567
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:10,300
Yeah, down here.

3568
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:13,220
We need to get blue because he has sentinel.

3569
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:14,620
Yeah.

3570
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:19,460
He's running up here.

3571
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,080
I feel like they're gonna play zone.

3572
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:23,780
Yeah, they might.

3573
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:26,240
He's just running up here.

3574
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:27,340
I don't know where his teammates are though.

3575
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:28,880
Where do we go?

3576
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,560
We go left or...

3577
02:05:31,820 --> 02:05:32,140
Yeah.

3578
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:35,300
I'll go grab the right one.

3579
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,060
You can go for the left one.

3580
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:40,220
You can just go up here.

3581
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:41,500
Yeah.

3582
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:43,640
I'm freaky.

3583
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:47,820
I'll follow Mr. Freaky right now.

3584
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:48,660
I'm gonna hit the UV here.

3585
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:51,360
I wanna have sex with us.

3586
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:57,040
Damn, he's already getting his freak on now.

3587
02:05:57,400 --> 02:05:59,100
He's getting his freak on.

3588
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:01,020
It's late night.

3589
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:03,260
It's freaky hours now.

3590
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:09,480
He's locked in but like a different type of locked.

3591
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,060
Oh my god.

3592
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:17,710
Oh my god.

3593
02:06:18,010 --> 02:06:18,770
Alright.

3594
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:21,570
It's demon hours.

3595
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:23,370
It's gooning hours.

3596
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:25,210
Oh my god.

3597
02:06:28,110 --> 02:06:28,870
Bro.

3598
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:32,350
Bro.

3599
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:32,930
Bro.

3600
02:06:32,970 --> 02:06:33,270
Bro.

3601
02:06:36,310 --> 02:06:37,410
You're just like no.

3602
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:37,830
I can't focus.

3603
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:40,550
Okay, we're locked in.

3604
02:06:40,610 --> 02:06:41,370
We're locked in.

3605
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:44,390
Yeah, let's go.

3606
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:45,130
Let's fucking go.

3607
02:06:46,230 --> 02:06:47,970
We're locked in now, right?

3608
02:06:48,310 --> 02:06:49,530
Oh my fucking god.

3609
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:51,990
He's not locked.

3610
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:53,450
He's not locked, guys.

3611
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:57,010
He's not locked, guys.

3612
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:00,770
What happened unlucky?

3613
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:01,510
Leave me alone.

3614
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:01,970
Leave me alone.

3615
02:07:04,990 --> 02:07:06,410
I'm not a pathfinder man, okay?

3616
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:07,830
I only play character for fun.

3617
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:10,890
Then why did you pick pathfinder?

3618
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:12,130
I have to.

3619
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:12,970
I'm forced out here.

3620
02:07:14,230 --> 02:07:15,950
If not me, who is going to...

3621
02:07:15,950 --> 02:07:16,490
What do you mean?

3622
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:17,630
What do you mean forced?

3623
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:20,350
You can pick whatever you fucking want.

3624
02:07:20,350 --> 02:07:21,330
I can play back if you want to.

3625
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:25,270
Where was it?

3626
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:26,030
Why did you put another one?

3627
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:28,990
Why are you crushing my pathfinder gameplay?

3628
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:32,330
Maybe if we swap pathfinder, maybe we'll win.

3629
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:32,530
Maybe if we swap pathfinder, maybe we'll win.

3630
02:07:32,530 --> 02:07:33,090
They hit you and me.

3631
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,470
Why the fuck are these guys so late?

3632
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:40,210
Yeah, what the fuck?

3633
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:41,770
They're chasing a solo there.

3634
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:44,170
Yeah, but what if this team is coming with me?

3635
02:07:44,370 --> 02:07:47,070
Yeah, there's a team coming in our back, so we might as well.

3636
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:49,210
Yeah, there's a team coming in our back, so we might as well.

3637
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:50,190
Is it a right angle?

3638
02:07:50,310 --> 02:07:51,390
I feel like it's a right angle.

3639
02:07:52,850 --> 02:07:53,550
I'll stay here.

3640
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:55,910
I'll come up too.

3641
02:07:57,010 --> 02:07:57,510
Yeah.

3642
02:07:58,070 --> 02:07:59,430
I'm running with her.

3643
02:08:00,150 --> 02:08:00,670
Alright.

3644
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:02,950
Are they coming?

3645
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:06,950
They're ballooning.

3646
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:08,330
The wall called it, bro.

3647
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:09,970
Are they going to be here?

3648
02:08:10,150 --> 02:08:12,990
Are they going barometer?

3649
02:08:13,790 --> 02:08:14,310
Yeah.

3650
02:08:14,830 --> 02:08:15,350
Goddamn.

3651
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:17,750
Alright.

3652
02:08:19,590 --> 02:08:20,610
Locked in for real.

3653
02:08:20,970 --> 02:08:22,270
Am I hitting the cannon or what?

3654
02:08:23,070 --> 02:08:23,590
No.

3655
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:23,770
No?

3656
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:24,210
No.

3657
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:27,510
Yeah, he's definitely not locked in.

3658
02:08:28,590 --> 02:08:30,290
I am, I am, I am.

3659
02:08:31,410 --> 02:08:33,450
Bro, you wanted to take the fucking cannon.

3660
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:35,290
There's like two teams over there.

3661
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:36,850
There's no one.

3662
02:08:37,490 --> 02:08:39,410
Alright, I swear I saw a gunshot.

3663
02:08:42,270 --> 02:08:42,710
Stars.

3664
02:08:42,810 --> 02:08:43,310
Where's the stars?

3665
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:46,090
I'm hitting the beacon.

3666
02:08:46,190 --> 02:08:46,650
Shooting stars.

3667
02:08:49,290 --> 02:08:50,450
Can you smoke me?

3668
02:08:51,650 --> 02:08:52,370
Thank you, man.

3669
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:53,670
Nice.

3670
02:08:53,810 --> 02:08:53,910
You're welcome.

3671
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:57,610
It's okay, he's not...

3672
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:58,130
Oh, fuck!

3673
02:08:58,330 --> 02:08:59,450
Oh shit, okay.

3674
02:08:59,830 --> 02:09:00,330
I was scared.

3675
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:04,130
Blue armor.

3676
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:07,250
That bang is healing.

3677
02:09:08,610 --> 02:09:09,050
Rampart.

3678
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:10,230
Why am I playing Rampart?

3679
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,410
It's a Newcastle Rampart team.

3680
02:09:15,810 --> 02:09:17,290
Should I go up to you guys?

3681
02:09:19,170 --> 02:09:19,610
Maybe.

3682
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:20,950
Okay, I head over.

3683
02:09:21,130 --> 02:09:22,150
I'm looking right now, where are they?

3684
02:09:23,310 --> 02:09:23,790
Are they?

3685
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:24,150
Do you see them?

3686
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:25,590
Oh, they're here.

3687
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:27,830
Yeah, there they are.

3688
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:30,790
We can't pinch them, there's a team behind them.

3689
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:32,850
Yeah, don't go right now.

3690
02:09:34,070 --> 02:09:35,310
Alright, I'm pushing up.

3691
02:09:35,330 --> 02:09:37,570
I'm gonna scrap the...

3692
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:38,530
Ugh.

3693
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:41,330
They're getting shot from a team to my left.

3694
02:09:42,030 --> 02:09:42,570
Yeah, they are.

3695
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:45,570
They got down, they dropped off the high ground.

3696
02:09:46,350 --> 02:09:47,090
There's one inside.

3697
02:09:47,270 --> 02:09:48,070
Yeah, there's one.

3698
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:51,130
Oh, we're kind of zoned.

3699
02:09:51,770 --> 02:09:52,830
Oh, nice.

3700
02:09:58,150 --> 02:09:59,650
I'm heading over.

3701
02:10:03,170 --> 02:10:04,310
I'm heading over.

3702
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:05,150
I'm heading over.

3703
02:10:06,990 --> 02:10:09,250
We should need one more evil cash for purple.

3704
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:10,530
We should need one more evil cash for purple.

3705
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:11,590
Yes, sir.

3706
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:19,690
We can scan that one.

3707
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:20,810
Alright.

3708
02:10:22,250 --> 02:10:24,110
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

3709
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:25,890
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

3710
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:29,450
Alright, let's get that.

3711
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:32,050
I'm zipped.

3712
02:10:33,730 --> 02:10:35,090
I'm gonna grab that purple.

3713
02:10:35,230 --> 02:10:36,590
And then I'll zip up.

3714
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:37,630
Is there somebody here?

3715
02:10:40,290 --> 02:10:41,750
Is there anybody there?

3716
02:10:41,890 --> 02:10:42,470
Yeah, just kill him.

3717
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:44,610
You're the unlucky.

3718
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:46,830
Alright.

3719
02:10:49,270 --> 02:10:49,670
Alright.

3720
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:50,450
Alright, I'm here.

3721
02:10:58,160 --> 02:10:59,280
You're so safe.

3722
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:01,520
Alright, I'm hitting either one.

3723
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:04,420
Nobody loses, so that means there's nothing here.

3724
02:11:04,620 --> 02:11:04,900
Be calm.

3725
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:07,200
There's a team here.

3726
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:09,860
Yeah, let's go kill that team.

3727
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:11,320
Let's go there?

3728
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:13,040
Yeah, they're gonna go for the guys probably.

3729
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:13,880
Alright.

3730
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:16,240
One of them is so far.

3731
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:19,120
I'm ballooning for myself.

3732
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:20,280
I'm ballooning for myself.

3733
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:20,900
I'm with Effect.

3734
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:26,390
Whoa.

3735
02:11:27,670 --> 02:11:28,750
Not 10 seconds.

3736
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:31,350
Looking to my left just in case.

3737
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:33,630
I don't see anybody yet.

3738
02:11:34,390 --> 02:11:34,710
I don't see anybody yet.

3739
02:11:36,250 --> 02:11:37,010
I'm still in building.

3740
02:11:37,150 --> 02:11:37,550
On the roof.

3741
02:11:37,670 --> 02:11:40,810
Yeah, purple armor.

3742
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:41,470
On the roof.

3743
02:11:43,650 --> 02:11:44,530
Jesus Christ.

3744
02:11:44,670 --> 02:11:45,110
Yeah.

3745
02:11:47,710 --> 02:11:47,770
I'm ballooning.

3746
02:11:48,270 --> 02:11:49,470
Yeah, he's still there on that building.

3747
02:11:53,110 --> 02:11:54,930
Literally looked for one second.

3748
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:56,910
There's a guy in the window too.

3749
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:58,270
Yeah, I smoked him.

3750
02:11:59,070 --> 02:12:00,090
Is this a teammate?

3751
02:12:00,190 --> 02:12:00,550
No way.

3752
02:12:00,670 --> 02:12:01,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3753
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:02,730
I'm wave.

3754
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:03,590
Unlucky.

3755
02:12:04,170 --> 02:12:04,870
Okay, I'm playing him.

3756
02:12:07,950 --> 02:12:08,730
Oh, I'm with...

3757
02:12:08,730 --> 02:12:09,450
I'm batting.

3758
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:12,650
He can maybe ult to Effect if he's fighting there.

3759
02:12:15,790 --> 02:12:17,130
I'm pushing up with you guys.

3760
02:12:17,870 --> 02:12:18,190
Yeah.

3761
02:12:19,410 --> 02:12:20,070
Yeah, they're back top.

3762
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:23,710
Yeah, fucking nerds.

3763
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:29,040
We can try to follow from tunnel.

3764
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:30,180
We can walk up right side maybe.

3765
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:31,740
Mm-hmm.

3766
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:34,120
All the way right, you mean?

3767
02:12:34,580 --> 02:12:36,360
Yeah, you can scan him in.

3768
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:38,080
Let's see if we can get further.

3769
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:40,680
Let's hit the smoke me.

3770
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:41,580
Yeah, shots up there.

3771
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:43,240
They're bangling up there.

3772
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:45,560
Should we just go up now?

3773
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:46,040
Yeah, we'll fight them.

3774
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:47,500
Low, below.

3775
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:50,820
Should I hit the UV if I can though?

3776
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:51,240
Yeah, do it.

3777
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:53,180
I can shot.

3778
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:54,240
It's fine.

3779
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:56,600
Yeah, let's go up.

3780
02:12:57,240 --> 02:12:57,760
Yeah, yeah.

3781
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:58,160
Go up?

3782
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:58,400
Okay.

3783
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:00,300
Don't let this team below you to see it though.

3784
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:01,400
Oh, yeah.

3785
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:04,680
It's a solo and a full team.

3786
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:05,880
I got shot too.

3787
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:07,360
Maybe.

3788
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:11,520
I need a shield cell, full heal.

3789
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:11,920
Hit this guy here.

3790
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:13,060
Three, two, one.

3791
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:13,660
It's all you.

3792
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:15,480
I got one.

3793
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:15,780
Nice.

3794
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:19,520
Hang up still a bit.

3795
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:21,660
Rampart.

3796
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:23,820
Rampart cracked.

3797
02:13:23,940 --> 02:13:24,240
Rampart one.

3798
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:27,400
Chop them.

3799
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:29,580
Are we starting?

3800
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:30,920
Yeah.

3801
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:33,620
Yeah, I'm burning one.

3802
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,220
I can grapple in.

3803
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:34,520
I'm pushing.

3804
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:37,040
No, no, no.

3805
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:38,980
No!

3806
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:39,680
Oh my god!

3807
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:41,140
Holy shit!

3808
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:42,840
I got like 20...

3809
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:44,140
I took every shot there.

3810
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:47,220
They did everything.

3811
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:48,520
It was all in my face.

3812
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:49,140
Watch behind us, okay?

3813
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:53,040
He is resing.

3814
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:54,240
I'm going down.

3815
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:54,820
I'm kidding.

3816
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:54,840
I'm kidding.

3817
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:58,660
I literally took every fucking gunshot possible in there.

3818
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:02,240
Dead?

3819
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:03,880
Nice.

3820
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:08,000
I'm gonna get that 3x.

3821
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:09,680
I'm coming over you guys.

3822
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:11,120
Yeah, it's fine.

3823
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:11,240
It's fine.

3824
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:12,620
You can hold there.

3825
02:14:13,060 --> 02:14:13,260
Oh, hold up.

3826
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:13,660
High ground?

3827
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:14,020
Okay.

3828
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:14,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3829
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:15,660
Okay, okay.

3830
02:14:16,640 --> 02:14:19,800
50 of them?

3831
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:21,680
I don't have an angle.

3832
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:22,980
Look at that.

3833
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:26,140
Just hold tight.

3834
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:27,020
We're fucking chilling.

3835
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:27,500
Okay.

3836
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:29,100
Just watch here, okay?

3837
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:31,400
Watch this direction, okay?

3838
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:32,140
Yeah, I'm watching.

3839
02:14:34,020 --> 02:14:34,700
I'm just gonna loot here.

3840
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,900
Yeah, I'm coming in a second.

3841
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:38,300
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

3842
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:41,440
Okay, I'm good.

3843
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:41,780
Meow, meow.

3844
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:44,060
Okay.

3845
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:45,500
I'm gonna grab...

3846
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:47,240
Do you want the... I have a gold...

3847
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:48,780
I have a gold ball.

3848
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:49,460
Do you want that?

3849
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:50,780
I'm good.

3850
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:51,900
Actually, I can take it.

3851
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:52,680
Yeah, here.

3852
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:58,980
I dropped a purple too, so...

3853
02:14:58,980 --> 02:14:59,680
Or blue.

3854
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:01,220
Alright.

3855
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:03,280
Now you're freaky with the shotgun.

3856
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:08,000
Now you're freaky with the shotgun.

3857
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:08,700
I'm watching right.

3858
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:16,060
I'm watching right.

3859
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:17,820
I don't see anybody on this side.

3860
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:19,240
I'll drop down slowly.

3861
02:15:25,810 --> 02:15:27,090
Let me see some light ammo.

3862
02:15:27,330 --> 02:15:27,930
Some action.

3863
02:15:29,390 --> 02:15:30,610
Care package over there.

3864
02:15:31,550 --> 02:15:32,290
Here, by the way.

3865
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:32,610
Shots maybe?

3866
02:15:32,770 --> 02:15:33,810
Wait, did I move bins here?

3867
02:15:33,990 --> 02:15:34,790
There's no more bins here.

3868
02:15:36,110 --> 02:15:37,110
Saw a Valka, by the way.

3869
02:15:38,090 --> 02:15:39,470
Our back's cleared, by the way.

3870
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:40,470
True.

3871
02:15:40,590 --> 02:15:41,250
What the fuck is this?

3872
02:15:41,410 --> 02:15:41,810
Yeah, no bins.

3873
02:15:42,770 --> 02:15:43,450
What the hell?

3874
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:46,470
Yeah, nobody's in the back.

3875
02:15:46,650 --> 02:15:47,530
I don't know if you got me with that one.

3876
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:48,370
Alright, nice.

3877
02:15:48,370 --> 02:15:48,550
Good.

3878
02:15:50,330 --> 02:15:51,650
I'm gonna look at the magi quick a little bit.

3879
02:15:52,490 --> 02:15:52,850
Yeah.

3880
02:15:53,330 --> 02:15:55,730
I'm gonna conserve some ammo here.

3881
02:15:57,590 --> 02:15:58,710
What the fuck?

3882
02:15:59,430 --> 02:16:01,670
What are you doing here shooting me from that far?

3883
02:16:06,890 --> 02:16:08,110
Saw a Valks on this building, by the way.

3884
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:09,170
I have stone pulse kind of dish.

3885
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:10,890
I have real ploy.

3886
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:13,290
Can we just sit blade, hide?

3887
02:16:14,350 --> 02:16:14,930
Yeah, we can.

3888
02:16:14,990 --> 02:16:15,930
We can even below, maybe.

3889
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:16,230
Oh, even now?

3890
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:17,590
I think there's someone.

3891
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:19,550
We can oop them, maybe.

3892
02:16:19,710 --> 02:16:20,270
From here.

3893
02:16:21,190 --> 02:16:21,650
Yeah, but...

3894
02:16:21,950 --> 02:16:23,430
Can't you give me a balloon?

3895
02:16:24,230 --> 02:16:25,810
You're gonna get shot hard, though, from balloon.

3896
02:16:26,370 --> 02:16:28,170
No, we can... it's just balloon to bait, you know?

3897
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:29,270
Oh.

3898
02:16:29,630 --> 02:16:32,950
We can drop left side, and then zip.

3899
02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:33,370
You know?

3900
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:33,890
To the left.

3901
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:35,410
You do have real ploy, too.

3902
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:37,450
Yeah, you're gonna get shot in the ass.

3903
02:16:37,590 --> 02:16:38,470
That's so hard, though.

3904
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:40,330
You wanna do it late, though?

3905
02:16:42,630 --> 02:16:43,750
I think you're doing it late, no?

3906
02:16:44,270 --> 02:16:44,650
Yeah, yeah.

3907
02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:45,410
I'm just letting...

3908
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:47,490
This team's gonna fuck us.

3909
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:48,390
You have to smoke them, by the way.

3910
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:49,030
Okay?

3911
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:51,210
This team here.

3912
02:16:52,970 --> 02:16:53,390
This side.

3913
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:54,370
Like, these windows?

3914
02:16:54,550 --> 02:16:55,110
I think it's most...

3915
02:16:55,850 --> 02:16:57,530
I mean, we can just hug and walk out, bro.

3916
02:16:57,590 --> 02:16:58,610
We don't even have to go for the roof.

3917
02:16:58,630 --> 02:16:59,930
We can blend below, like, on the building, no?

3918
02:17:01,150 --> 02:17:01,490
Can we?

3919
02:17:01,610 --> 02:17:03,050
We should make sure we don't get mirrored by this team.

3920
02:17:03,110 --> 02:17:03,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3921
02:17:03,570 --> 02:17:03,870
Okay, okay.

3922
02:17:05,210 --> 02:17:05,810
Yeah, I'm watching right.

3923
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:08,570
Yeah, so we're just gonna cross.

3924
02:17:08,710 --> 02:17:09,570
I'm gonna smoke the cross, yeah?

3925
02:17:09,630 --> 02:17:11,450
Yeah, it's a solo, it's a solo vehicle, I think.

3926
02:17:11,550 --> 02:17:12,150
No, it's full team, full team.

3927
02:17:12,210 --> 02:17:12,730
Full team vehicle, dude.

3928
02:17:14,130 --> 02:17:16,130
There should be a solo somewhere on the right side, if she didn't die.

3929
02:17:18,110 --> 02:17:18,930
If she didn't get killed.

3930
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:20,830
Oh my god.

3931
02:17:21,630 --> 02:17:22,670
There's, like, light ammo here.

3932
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:23,370
There's light ammo here.

3933
02:17:24,830 --> 02:17:25,570
Yeah, it's fine.

3934
02:17:25,670 --> 02:17:25,950
I dropped it.

3935
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:26,690
I don't need it anymore.

3936
02:17:27,150 --> 02:17:28,770
I'm double... I'm fucking quadruple moza.

3937
02:17:28,930 --> 02:17:29,530
Oh, shit!

3938
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:31,090
Quadruple moza!

3939
02:17:31,110 --> 02:17:31,370
Okay.

3940
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:32,630
That's just crazy.

3941
02:17:32,890 --> 02:17:33,430
Yeah, that's crazy.

3942
02:17:33,710 --> 02:17:34,590
Wait, where do we go in Lucky?

3943
02:17:34,790 --> 02:17:35,570
Like, the two of us?

3944
02:17:35,810 --> 02:17:36,430
I'm just holding.

3945
02:17:36,610 --> 02:17:37,690
We're gonna go to Effect soon.

3946
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:38,370
Okay.

3947
02:17:39,310 --> 02:17:39,950
Should I ulti you?

3948
02:17:40,290 --> 02:17:43,030
Yeah, I feel like you're gonna fucking say that.

3949
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:45,870
Yeah, they're looking at me, so I can't walk safely.

3950
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:46,850
Just walk down, Tim.

3951
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:47,850
Should I go now?

3952
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:48,550
Yeah, just come, come, come.

3953
02:17:48,690 --> 02:17:49,070
This is welcome.

3954
02:17:50,430 --> 02:17:50,930
I'm walking, I'm walking.

3955
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:53,010
There's a team next to us playing Q somewhere.

3956
02:17:53,210 --> 02:17:54,530
The whole market's not in, though, by the way.

3957
02:17:55,470 --> 02:17:56,410
Just come to me, come to me.

3958
02:17:56,550 --> 02:17:58,090
Yeah, I just want them to not sip us here.

3959
02:17:58,130 --> 02:17:58,790
They can still sip us back.

3960
02:17:59,330 --> 02:17:59,810
I'll come later.

3961
02:18:00,050 --> 02:18:00,330
I'm here.

3962
02:18:02,550 --> 02:18:03,430
There's a team on the roof, Tim, inside.

3963
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:06,150
Oh, where do we...

3964
02:18:06,730 --> 02:18:07,110
Wait, wait.

3965
02:18:07,110 --> 02:18:07,730
Both on the roof, careful.

3966
02:18:08,510 --> 02:18:08,790
Okay.

3967
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:12,290
We're, like, safe here.

3968
02:18:12,410 --> 02:18:14,410
Oh, it's not really safe.

3969
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:16,450
Can she wall somewhere?

3970
02:18:16,590 --> 02:18:17,570
Can you wall here?

3971
02:18:17,690 --> 02:18:18,770
Yeah, put a wall here.

3972
02:18:21,210 --> 02:18:22,430
I have the shield.

3973
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:24,710
We can go bottom, we can go bottom.

3974
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:26,770
Let's go bottom, let's go bottom.

3975
02:18:26,930 --> 02:18:27,430
I'm killing it.

3976
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:27,890
Okay, okay.

3977
02:18:29,150 --> 02:18:29,830
Come below, come below.

3978
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:31,650
Watch the stairs, though.

3979
02:18:31,670 --> 02:18:32,510
I killed one guy here, by the way.

3980
02:18:32,630 --> 02:18:33,190
Yeah, I killed him, too.

3981
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:35,570
I need a full heal, I need a full heal.

3982
02:18:36,350 --> 02:18:36,870
Alright, alright, alright.

3983
02:18:37,390 --> 02:18:38,430
I got hit by a zone.

3984
02:18:40,190 --> 02:18:41,110
There's a full team in here.

3985
02:18:42,250 --> 02:18:42,810
I'm swinging.

3986
02:18:44,330 --> 02:18:45,150
That's you, that's you.

3987
02:18:46,310 --> 02:18:48,530
We have to watch the other team that's swinging us, that's why.

3988
02:18:48,650 --> 02:18:48,890
Okay, okay.

3989
02:18:49,390 --> 02:18:49,770
I'm coming.

3990
02:18:50,430 --> 02:18:50,990
There's a team that's swinging.

3991
02:18:53,430 --> 02:18:54,170
I'm shielding this.

3992
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:55,410
Yeah, I'm coming.

3993
02:18:56,410 --> 02:18:57,050
Last one.

3994
02:18:58,590 --> 02:18:59,430
I'm looking, I'm looking.

3995
02:18:59,690 --> 02:19:00,470
They're pushing, they're pushing.

3996
02:19:00,590 --> 02:19:01,470
New team pushing, new team pushing.

3997
02:19:01,850 --> 02:19:03,230
I think if I just play for your life.

3998
02:19:04,290 --> 02:19:05,470
It's third party, third party.

3999
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:06,970
Come inside, come inside.

4000
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:09,050
She's gonna block it.

4001
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:11,290
Okay, I'm out, I'm out.

4002
02:19:12,990 --> 02:19:14,330
I'll see if they're pushing stairs.

4003
02:19:14,890 --> 02:19:15,710
Crypto's pushing up.

4004
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:17,570
Full team pushing up, pushing up, pushing up now.

4005
02:19:17,570 --> 02:19:18,150
Okay, hold on.

4006
02:19:19,170 --> 02:19:19,930
I'm trying to...

4007
02:19:22,970 --> 02:19:24,590
Why are they swinging, bro?

4008
02:19:24,650 --> 02:19:25,210
Are they stupid?

4009
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:26,330
Yes.

4010
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:27,750
Yes.

4011
02:19:29,710 --> 02:19:30,270
They are.

4012
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:33,490
They're swung in the same moment I said they're gonna do it, probably.

4013
02:19:33,850 --> 02:19:34,150
Yup.

4014
02:19:35,210 --> 02:19:36,450
Did we get kills for them at least?

4015
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:38,550
Yeah, we got a couple kills for it.

4016
02:19:39,390 --> 02:19:40,150
I don't know.

4017
02:19:40,850 --> 02:19:41,250
Maybe.

4018
02:19:43,590 --> 02:19:44,470
Oh my god.

4019
02:19:44,470 --> 02:19:45,770
I didn't know how many...

4020
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:48,890
Like after you said there was a full team inside of one building, I didn't know if you want to fight or not.

4021
02:19:49,210 --> 02:19:50,950
Because then I had to bat when you said you were swinging.

4022
02:19:51,570 --> 02:19:52,610
The small building.

4023
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:54,290
Yeah, probably should have went back.

4024
02:19:55,810 --> 02:19:58,490
I mean, there's still five squads left, so...

4025
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:00,990
Yeah.

4026
02:20:02,090 --> 02:20:02,710
It's fine.

4027
02:20:05,250 --> 02:20:06,110
Oh my god.

4028
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:07,610
I can't believe they pushed that.

4029
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:08,390
That's crazy.

4030
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:10,730
They pushed that to lose.

4031
02:20:12,330 --> 02:20:13,090
I don't know.

4032
02:20:14,590 --> 02:20:15,690
Oh my god.

4033
02:20:17,490 --> 02:20:19,230
They couldn't handle it.

4034
02:20:19,410 --> 02:20:22,110
Yeah, that shit was insane.

4035
02:20:22,530 --> 02:20:23,990
We fucking killed so many people.

4036
02:20:26,810 --> 02:20:28,410
They didn't like our freak off.

4037
02:20:28,630 --> 02:20:29,490
They got jealous.

4038
02:20:31,490 --> 02:20:32,990
We're too freaky.

4039
02:20:33,370 --> 02:20:35,350
This team is just too freaky.

4040
02:20:37,430 --> 02:20:40,170
Yeah, didn't match our freak.

4041
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:48,510
Even if we don't win, we're the content here.

4042
02:20:48,730 --> 02:20:50,130
For real.

4043
02:20:50,390 --> 02:20:51,530
I mean, we had a good game.

4044
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:52,410
Yeah, that was a good game.

4045
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:57,110
We got lots of kills too for it.

4046
02:20:57,470 --> 02:20:59,210
We just got fucking grief there.

4047
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:01,510
I got shot in my back.

4048
02:21:01,950 --> 02:21:02,850
I went very back.

4049
02:21:02,910 --> 02:21:03,490
I'm going to use the bathroom.

4050
02:21:05,070 --> 02:21:05,570
Back shots.

4051
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:10,920
Back shots are real, bruh.

4052
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:14,420
Yeah, damn.

4053
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:22,460
Yeah, if you had like Kalos or something to get their doors away, then we could have done like play outside.

4054
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:25,400
Yeah, if only I shot my gun instead of throwing a nade, bruh.

4055
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:26,220
The timing was crazy.

4056
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:28,840
Kalos grappling as well.

4057
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:31,720
I would have not gone for sure.

4058
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:36,780
When I was walking up the stairs, I was so slow because I didn't realize I got back shots from the guy behind us.

4059
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:39,260
Yeah, he was sitting on top of the thing.

4060
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:41,040
I was so confused too.

4061
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:44,560
I was so slow.

4062
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:45,760
I was like, why am I going so slow?

4063
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:46,380
I was so slow up the stairs.

4064
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:47,100
I was like, commit, commit.

4065
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:49,480
And I was like, I'm a bag of shit.

4066
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:51,560
SkibitySigmas1!

4067
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:52,960
Oh!

4068
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:54,760
Oh no.

4069
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:56,880
SkibitySigmas.

4070
02:21:59,200 --> 02:21:59,560
BussyBussies.

4071
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:03,460
What did MonsunSigmas get?

4072
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:06,480
I did?

4073
02:22:07,660 --> 02:22:09,660
Yeah, pretty much even with them.

4074
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:09,900
Yeah.

4075
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:13,080
They're back.

4076
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:14,180
Yeah.

4077
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:16,100
They're fucking back.

4078
02:22:16,360 --> 02:22:19,120
Why is my chat talking about back shots?

4079
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:20,500
Nothing.

4080
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:21,020
Don't worry about it.

4081
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:25,840
Wait, did we die to the back shot team?

4082
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:27,480
No, no, no.

4083
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,380
Did we die?

4084
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:31,180
Oh no, oh no, no, no.

4085
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:33,780
Don't worry, we didn't get back shot by them.

4086
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:38,420
Oh yeah, 8 kills.

4087
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:41,720
Oh god, the SkibitySigmas with the fifth...

4088
02:22:41,720 --> 02:22:44,760
I swear, all the first place team has like insane amount of kills too.

4089
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:45,740
I swear, all the first place team has like insane amount of kills too.

4090
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:46,520
SkibitySigmas.

4091
02:22:47,060 --> 02:22:47,700
SkibitySigmas.

4092
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:49,300
Three more games.

4093
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:52,680
See, he locked back in.

4094
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:54,880
Unlucky locked in.

4095
02:22:55,820 --> 02:22:56,060
Huh?

4096
02:22:56,480 --> 02:22:57,920
I'm so, I'm so fucked.

4097
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:00,100
What do you mean?

4098
02:23:00,740 --> 02:23:02,180
You locked in.

4099
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:04,100
Struggles, struggles.

4100
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:05,440
How are you struggling?

4101
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:09,780
To be fair, you're sick too, so it makes sense.

4102
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:11,440
Yeah.

4103
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:12,940
You're so sleepy.

4104
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:14,280
So sleepy.

4105
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:15,380
You're so sleepy?

4106
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:18,100
Oh, I was gonna say drink coffee, but you're like literally sick.

4107
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:20,980
So, you can't drink coffee.

4108
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:22,340
You drink tea.

4109
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:25,580
Uh, yeah, I know.

4110
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:29,380
I was so tired, I was drinking Red Bull.

4111
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:32,660
Holy shit, what the fuck is wrong with you?

4112
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:38,520
Oh my god.

4113
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:44,580
That's actually crazy.

4114
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:47,260
You would drink Red Bull when you're...

4115
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:49,760
when you're sick.

4116
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:51,220
Yeah.

4117
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:53,560
I had to, otherwise it's chalked.

4118
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:54,280
Like, I was so tired.

4119
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:56,320
Yeah.

4120
02:23:56,620 --> 02:23:57,520
Wait, did you not sleep?

4121
02:23:59,560 --> 02:23:59,920
Mmm...

4122
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:04,700
No, I did a little bit, but when I woke up, like, 15 minutes before a tournament, I was like, just still tired.

4123
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:05,360
Oh.

4124
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:07,640
Yeah, yeah, cause you just woke up type deal.

4125
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:09,260
Yeah.

4126
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:10,900
You're slowly waking up, right?

4127
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:14,340
The longer we play, right?

4128
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:14,900
Is that it?

4129
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:16,120
Uh-huh.

4130
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:17,820
I don't think that's it.

4131
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,360
I don't think so.

4132
02:24:18,380 --> 02:24:19,060
I don't think so.

4133
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:21,500
Are you kidding me?

4134
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:23,620
I'll fall to bad as soon as the tournament is over.

4135
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:27,060
Okay, next game.

4136
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:29,580
I'm not surprised that Dragon's team is winning.

4137
02:24:30,260 --> 02:24:32,800
They're like 20 points ahead of us.

4138
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:33,480
It's fine.

4139
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:35,300
Everyone's nothing.

4140
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:36,040
We can still achieve that.

4141
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:37,180
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

4142
02:24:37,300 --> 02:24:37,700
We still have three more games.

4143
02:24:37,880 --> 02:24:38,620
We have three more games.

4144
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:40,000
We'll just kill...

4145
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,380
They're like, they're like literally behind, like right next...

4146
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:44,060
They're like, they got, they're right next to us twice.

4147
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:45,700
Yeah.

4148
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:45,900
Yeah.

4149
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:48,040
Yo, how's Lillibar looking?

4150
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:51,480
Are we close to number one?

4151
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:52,840
We are fourth place.

4152
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:53,440
We're on...

4153
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:54,220
We're fourth place.

4154
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:56,460
Third place is two points ahead of us.

4155
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:57,120
Or three.

4156
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:58,040
Sorry, I can't do math.

4157
02:24:58,360 --> 02:25:00,120
Uh, it's three points ahead of us.

4158
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:02,620
Three points ahead of us.

4159
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:05,380
SkippitySigma is like second place.

4160
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:06,540
That's crazy.

4161
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,100
SkippitySigma is second place.

4162
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:09,980
They've only got one first place.

4163
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:13,240
I mean, how... I mean, we have fourth.

4164
02:25:13,300 --> 02:25:13,600
It's crazy.

4165
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:14,500
To be fair, to be fair.

4166
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:15,500
Yeah, we have two games.

4167
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:15,580
Yeah, we won.

4168
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:17,840
We have two games.

4169
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:19,320
We have two games where we didn't even do anything.

4170
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:24,340
So, like, I feel like us being... We were experimenting, okay, guys?

4171
02:25:24,420 --> 02:25:24,920
We were...

4172
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:27,420
We were theorycrafting in two games.

4173
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:28,600
But now we know our limits.

4174
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:30,720
So we won't do that again, right guys?

4175
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:33,560
We won't make mistakes now.

4176
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:35,020
Um...

4177
02:25:35,740 --> 02:25:37,620
Guys, we haven't played together before.

4178
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:39,160
Guys, as a team.

4179
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:41,800
So we were... Yeah, it's the first time.

4180
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:44,620
And we're literally nerfed so hard.

4181
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:49,180
I mean, if you didn't have this one game, I was lagging, you know?

4182
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:49,920
That's true!

4183
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:51,220
That's true!

4184
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:53,640
If he wasn't lagging...

4185
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:57,720
Like, if he fixes his internet, things would have been fine.

4186
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:58,560
True, bro.

4187
02:25:58,640 --> 02:25:59,300
Move out of Australia.

4188
02:25:59,580 --> 02:26:00,340
Yo, my bad.

4189
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:01,520
I'm moving to Tokyo, bro.

4190
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:01,840
You got me.

4191
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:03,880
Yeah, yeah, you should move to Tokyo.

4192
02:26:05,300 --> 02:26:06,820
I think there's someone else who got you.

4193
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:08,800
Huh?

4194
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:09,120
Huh?

4195
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:10,100
Excuse me?

4196
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:10,300
What?

4197
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:11,460
Us?

4198
02:26:11,460 --> 02:26:13,140
Shit, you're moving in with Effect?

4199
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:14,520
Oh my god!

4200
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:15,380
One bedroom?

4201
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:17,120
That's my dream, bro.

4202
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:22,060
You really...

4203
02:26:22,060 --> 02:26:23,020
We learn how to cook together.

4204
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:23,860
Oh!

4205
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:29,560
We all just go to town alone by those fucking sandwiches all the time.

4206
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:30,740
Oh yeah, the convenies?

4207
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:31,000
Yeah.

4208
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:31,800
Oh my god.

4209
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:32,400
We need to cook.

4210
02:26:32,660 --> 02:26:33,400
That's true.

4211
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:34,980
That's true.

4212
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:35,940
That blood cook.

4213
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:39,680
Oh my god.

4214
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:41,540
Never have to cook again.

4215
02:26:41,540 --> 02:26:45,160
I mean, the reason why they're getting one bedroom is to save rent, guys.

4216
02:26:45,380 --> 02:26:47,380
It's expensive for them.

4217
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:47,920
Yeah, man.

4218
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:49,260
Yeah, they gotta save rent.

4219
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:53,700
The bed is probably like half of what one was probably.

4220
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,240
How are we gonna fit on it?

4221
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:58,000
It's gotta be extra close.

4222
02:26:58,820 --> 02:26:59,860
It's gotta be extra close.

4223
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:02,540
Restarting game crash and blur.

4224
02:27:04,060 --> 02:27:04,620
Squeezed up.

4225
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:04,860
What the hell?

4226
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:07,920
Yeah, my controller's having a seizure right now.

4227
02:27:08,300 --> 02:27:09,040
Oh shit.

4228
02:27:09,620 --> 02:27:11,140
My controller just DC'd 15 times.

4229
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:13,120
Match ended.

4230
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:13,600
Nice.

4231
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:15,020
Scrims.

4232
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:19,280
And they were just roommates.

4233
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:19,740
Exactly.

4234
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:20,980
They're just roommates, guys.

4235
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:22,660
Yeah.

4236
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:28,000
They're just roommates.

4237
02:27:30,040 --> 02:27:31,240
How do you play?

4238
02:27:33,420 --> 02:27:34,540
How do you play?

4239
02:27:35,580 --> 02:27:36,100
What the fuck?

4240
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:37,000
Nah, bro.

4241
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:37,900
That's so rude.

4242
02:27:38,180 --> 02:27:39,000
What does that mean?

4243
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:40,240
What does that mean?

4244
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:41,320
I'm playing like a cancer.

4245
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:42,300
What?

4246
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:45,620
Clippy, for damn timing you out, man.

4247
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:48,820
Damn.

4248
02:27:49,460 --> 02:27:50,100
Look at that.

4249
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:51,880
Look at that.

4250
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:52,660
Bro's...

4251
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:55,600
Yeah, how could you say that to his bro like that?

4252
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:59,080
Man, I thought you were gonna say nice words like you're so beautiful or some shit.

4253
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:02,260
Yeah, you gotta teach unlucky how to say that.

4254
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:07,240
To use for his bro.

4255
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:08,520
Defending his bro.

4256
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:09,000
Wow.

4257
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:10,860
I need to...

4258
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:11,080
Defend his...

4259
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:14,200
How to say you're beautiful in Russian?

4260
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:16,220
You're probably dead but I forgot.

4261
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:17,560
Oh my god, how could you forget?

4262
02:28:19,220 --> 02:28:20,320
I don't know, I just...

4263
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:22,180
I forgot a lot of things.

4264
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,820
My memory is really bad.

4265
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:27,020
Okay, what do you remember from the words Effect taught you?

4266
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:28,020
Probably none.

4267
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:31,360
Arigato.

4268
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:34,920
That's not even Russian!

4269
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:36,540
That's Japanese!

4270
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:37,040
That's Japanese!

4271
02:28:38,980 --> 02:28:40,300
That's not even Russian!

4272
02:28:41,140 --> 02:28:43,160
Oh, I thought you meant in general what he taught me.

4273
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:45,560
I don't know.

4274
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:49,060
Bro...

4275
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:52,260
I bet Effect remembers everything you taught him.

4276
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:54,420
I mean...

4277
02:28:54,420 --> 02:28:55,560
Nah, he never taught me anything.

4278
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:57,080
Woah...

4279
02:28:57,480 --> 02:28:58,560
He didn't teach you anything?

4280
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:02,320
Bro, that's not so rude to say.

4281
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:03,020
That's not true.

4282
02:29:03,860 --> 02:29:04,880
What did you teach him?

4283
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:05,600
Yeah, what did you teach him?

4284
02:29:09,980 --> 02:29:10,520
Bro...

4285
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:14,580
I need to teach him myself, man.

4286
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:18,200
He needs to teach himself German again.

4287
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:20,420
Yeah...

4288
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:22,380
Bro...

4289
02:29:22,380 --> 02:29:23,700
That's fucked, bro.

4290
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:25,980
Yeah, teach us.

4291
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:27,520
Yeah, teach me.

4292
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:30,640
What does that mean?

4293
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:32,160
Bad word, bad word.

4294
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:36,520
Wait, you know it!

4295
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:37,480
So you do remember!

4296
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:41,520
Yeah, cause I said it almost every time.

4297
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:42,300
That's why you know it.

4298
02:29:44,380 --> 02:29:45,560
Oh my god, man.

4299
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:46,680
See?

4300
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:49,560
You do remember your bro's language.

4301
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:51,480
Give it to the producers, man.

4302
02:29:53,860 --> 02:29:56,480
My chat was like, don't repeat that!

4303
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:57,760
That's a no!

4304
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:58,760
No way!

4305
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:02,320
No, it's not that bad.

4306
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:04,040
It's like, it's alright.

4307
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:04,800
Yeah, I could say worse.

4308
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:05,840
Oh.

4309
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:07,980
Oh my god.

4310
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:12,840
I'm so cooked.

4311
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:14,220
Unlucky, teach us a word.

4312
02:30:15,980 --> 02:30:16,420
Um...

4313
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:19,160
Let me think.

4314
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,820
Bro, I don't talk German anymore.

4315
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:23,980
I don't even know how to talk German.

4316
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:26,320
Don't you live in Austria?

4317
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:27,820
Yeah.

4318
02:30:28,140 --> 02:30:30,160
What do you mean you don't use German anymore?

4319
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:33,240
You literally live in a country that speaks the language.

4320
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:34,640
I got one, I got one.

4321
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:37,400
What does that mean?

4322
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:46,860
What is that?

4323
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:47,580
Sounds like a spell.

4324
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:50,260
Yeah, what is he saying?

4325
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:58,240
To be honest, I wouldn't even know how to translate that in English, to be honest.

4326
02:31:00,060 --> 02:31:01,080
I wouldn't even know.

4327
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:03,160
Someone's like, oh dear.

4328
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:04,980
I didn't know Doki was into that stuff.

4329
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:08,100
It's Austrian.

4330
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:11,920
It's Austrian, man.

4331
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:13,500
Squirrel's tail?

4332
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:14,280
What the fuck?

4333
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:15,220
Tail of a squirrel?

4334
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:16,340
What the fuck does that mean?

4335
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:17,460
What?

4336
02:31:17,460 --> 02:31:17,740
Wait.

4337
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:23,440
What the fuck does squirrel's tail...

4338
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:23,720
...

4339
02:31:23,720 --> 02:31:24,020
...

4340
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:24,900
...

4341
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:29,640
...

4342
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:33,880
What does that even mean?

4343
02:31:34,260 --> 02:31:35,380
I have no idea.

4344
02:31:36,140 --> 02:31:38,520
He just gave us a random word!

4345
02:31:39,320 --> 02:31:40,740
He just made it up.

4346
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:42,280
He just made it up.

4347
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:45,080
From pros casting spells.

4348
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,800
He's a fucking wizard.

4349
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:51,660
Alright.

4350
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:51,920
Alright.

4351
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:53,160
Bro became easier.

4352
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:54,840
Bro become...

4353
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:56,080
After that freaky shit.

4354
02:31:57,340 --> 02:32:00,780
Wait, we all know about Germans and their freakiness.

4355
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:02,180
What is about the Austrians?

4356
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:03,260
Are they...

4357
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:11,060
Since Austria is Germany's neighbor, they are just as freaky.

4358
02:32:12,580 --> 02:32:14,180
Are you gonna match my freak?

4359
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,020
This is why teams kill us early.

4360
02:32:20,020 --> 02:32:22,540
They don't want... they're scared.

4361
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:26,780
My coughing is getting worse.

4362
02:32:27,020 --> 02:32:27,580
Oh no.

4363
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:28,100
It's bad.

4364
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:30,220
Got an ambulance.

4365
02:32:30,400 --> 02:32:30,960
Shocked.

4366
02:32:31,060 --> 02:32:32,560
We made them laugh.

4367
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:33,540
It's getting worse.

4368
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:34,900
Yeah.

4369
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:36,760
It really does.

4370
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:43,560
Holy fucking...

4371
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:47,980
I bet you guys... I bet you guys... our team has the most content.

4372
02:32:48,780 --> 02:32:49,820
We are the content.

4373
02:32:50,020 --> 02:32:50,340
We are the content team.

4374
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:51,720
It really does.

4375
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:52,200
Yeah.

4376
02:32:52,340 --> 02:32:53,480
Are we also gonna win the tournament?

4377
02:32:53,620 --> 02:32:54,060
Yeah.

4378
02:32:54,700 --> 02:32:58,400
And if we don't, we burn... we sell effects as MVP.

4379
02:32:59,280 --> 02:32:59,660
Oh, you want burn?

4380
02:32:59,860 --> 02:33:00,680
I'm down for it.

4381
02:33:00,780 --> 02:33:01,380
Like, you know where he lives?

4382
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:02,240
I mean, you said burn first.

4383
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:02,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4384
02:33:02,900 --> 02:33:03,660
You know where he lives?

4385
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:04,420
Are we...

4386
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:05,820
Okay.

4387
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:08,700
Crazy.

4388
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:10,240
I'm down.

4389
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:11,900
Are we gonna do it?

4390
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:12,780
Alright.

4391
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:14,220
If we don't...

4392
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:17,420
In fact, remember, if we don't win first, we're fucking heading over there.

4393
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:18,520
Burning...

4394
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:20,740
We'll stream it too.

4395
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:21,620
We'll stream it too.

4396
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:23,140
What the fuck?

4397
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:25,580
We'll stream the blibber.

4398
02:33:25,580 --> 02:33:26,120
We'll stream the blibber.

4399
02:33:26,140 --> 02:33:27,240
I'll try to form on Zoom, bro.

4400
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:28,800
I'll try to form on Zoom, bro.

4401
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:30,240
Stop it.

4402
02:33:30,340 --> 02:33:30,780
He's gonna hate me.

4403
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:31,760
Let's go kill EchoHQ.

4404
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:32,620
Bro, let's go kill EchoHQ.

4405
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:33,020
Yeah, okay.

4406
02:33:33,140 --> 02:33:33,460
For the live.

4407
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:35,340
I need one who still have EVE.

4408
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,500
I have a Havoc and a...

4409
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:38,820
I have a Havoc and a...

4410
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:41,000
I'm not scared of you, V, though.

4411
02:33:41,060 --> 02:33:41,120
I'm not scared of you, V, though.

4412
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:43,240
He's like a bitch and he's doing weird things over there.

4413
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:48,380
I'm not scared of you, V, though.

4414
02:33:48,380 --> 02:33:49,200
They're not freaking yet.

4415
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:49,440
Can you smoke?

4416
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:53,780
I'm still gonna get headed.

4417
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:56,440
Alright, I'm leaving already.

4418
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:58,220
EchoHQ's already leaving too, but we can go.

4419
02:33:58,940 --> 02:33:59,460
Alright.

4420
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:02,860
Smells like a...

4421
02:34:02,860 --> 02:34:03,440
It's making my jaw freak.

4422
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:05,020
Yeah.

4423
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:08,420
These guys are so sweaty.

4424
02:34:08,860 --> 02:34:12,320
I bet you they're hard calming and not even laughing at all.

4425
02:34:13,480 --> 02:34:16,020
I bet they're not even sick like us.

4426
02:34:16,520 --> 02:34:17,580
I hope not.

4427
02:34:17,820 --> 02:34:18,180
Yeah.

4428
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:18,360
I bet you they're not even sick like us.

4429
02:34:18,360 --> 02:34:19,460
How dare they.

4430
02:34:19,560 --> 02:34:21,560
They should go outside right now and get sick.

4431
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:27,060
I'm gonna sleep like a baby.

4432
02:34:29,460 --> 02:34:31,540
You're gonna fix your sleep schedule after this tournament?

4433
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:33,260
It was already fixed.

4434
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:33,700
That's the issue.

4435
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:36,180
Like, I woke up at 8am every day in the past days.

4436
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:38,480
Okay, don't worry.

4437
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:39,200
You'll fix it now.

4438
02:34:42,060 --> 02:34:44,300
I'm a little... I'm like five seconds behind.

4439
02:34:45,180 --> 02:34:45,820
Yeah, it's fine.

4440
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:47,160
I'm gonna hit the UV quick.

4441
02:34:48,380 --> 02:34:48,820
Okay.

4442
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:51,560
I have a purple energy mag, but I don't know if I'm gonna need it.

4443
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:53,280
I do.

4444
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:55,880
I have a... I have an energy.

4445
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:56,360
Yeah.

4446
02:34:58,040 --> 02:34:59,160
These guys are running, bro.

4447
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:00,960
All three on each other.

4448
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:02,360
They're like...

4449
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:03,280
Yeah.

4450
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:04,780
They're scared.

4451
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:08,160
They wanna get in... Everybody's playing zone.

4452
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:10,400
Fucking nerds.

4453
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,040
Fucking nerds, man.

4454
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:12,600
Yeah.

4455
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:15,320
Fucking play BLGS if you're gonna play zone.

4456
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:23,620
Oh, I'm saying... This is like only $100.

4457
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:24,460
Come on, guys.

4458
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:26,140
For a lot.

4459
02:35:26,260 --> 02:35:26,700
Okay.

4460
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:27,740
True.

4461
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:28,040
True.

4462
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:28,520
True.

4463
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:29,000
True.

4464
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,120
But all I'm saying...

4465
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:33,360
I'm like, I know it's nothing for you.

4466
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:34,780
Excuse me?

4467
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:36,560
I'm not rich.

4468
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:37,700
You can never be too rich.

4469
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:38,200
That's the thing.

4470
02:35:38,220 --> 02:35:38,980
Oh, don't... Guys, remember.

4471
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:40,340
They're EU, guys.

4472
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:42,220
They have nothing in... No tournaments there.

4473
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:45,960
Yeah, Sadoki's doing charity.

4474
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:51,460
Oh, wait.

4475
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:52,080
They just scanned.

4476
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:52,300
Yeah.

4477
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:55,240
Yep.

4478
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:58,520
You still have that energy mag?

4479
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:00,200
Yep.

4480
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:03,660
They can't hit shit.

4481
02:36:03,800 --> 02:36:04,440
Okay, they hit me.

4482
02:36:06,740 --> 02:36:07,840
Well, I was gonna sit up there.

4483
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:08,880
I was like...

4484
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:10,360
What were you getting shot at from right side?

4485
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,620
That's... That should be Dragon's team then.

4486
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:13,980
Raise one.

4487
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:16,680
Yeah.

4488
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:18,340
I don't know if you wanna fight them.

4489
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:20,820
Yeah, because if Dragon's team might throw at us...

4490
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:27,980
Whoa.

4491
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:29,320
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

4492
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,700
I don't think... I just went there for the cash.

4493
02:36:34,760 --> 02:36:35,340
I don't think they're coming.

4494
02:36:35,460 --> 02:36:36,020
Dragon's not coming.

4495
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:36,540
We can kill this.

4496
02:36:36,620 --> 02:36:36,860
Okay.

4497
02:36:36,980 --> 02:36:37,320
Oh, yeah.

4498
02:36:37,460 --> 02:36:38,200
You have a zip, right?

4499
02:36:38,620 --> 02:36:39,180
They're all calling.

4500
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:40,680
They are?

4501
02:36:41,140 --> 02:36:41,460
Yeah.

4502
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:43,120
Okay, I'm saving a vehicle.

4503
02:36:45,220 --> 02:36:46,020
14, 19.

4504
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:46,680
15.

4505
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:48,820
I got 15.

4506
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:50,800
Are we getting that cash to our left?

4507
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:52,620
Yeah, we can.

4508
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:54,880
I'm gonna grab this pick.

4509
02:36:55,660 --> 02:36:56,500
The ones you know.

4510
02:36:56,540 --> 02:36:57,300
We can go after them.

4511
02:36:58,100 --> 02:36:58,840
Yeah, in a second.

4512
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:00,080
Let's go after them.

4513
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:03,040
That's our prey.

4514
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:03,860
We need to kill them.

4515
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:06,420
We need that one kill, guys.

4516
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:06,960
We're desperate.

4517
02:37:07,340 --> 02:37:08,400
There's a lot of light up here.

4518
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:10,340
Yeah, I need some.

4519
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:13,360
Okay.

4520
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:14,360
Du gesicht.

4521
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:15,440
Gesicht.

4522
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:16,320
Gesicht.

4523
02:37:17,220 --> 02:37:17,620
What?

4524
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:19,560
Du gesicht.

4525
02:37:19,700 --> 02:37:20,380
Du gesicht.

4526
02:37:20,700 --> 02:37:20,780
What?

4527
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:21,200
What does that mean?

4528
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:23,940
You're literally saying your face.

4529
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:25,160
Your face.

4530
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:26,840
What the fuck, man?

4531
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:33,220
He's just admiring your face right now.

4532
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:42,700
He wants you to turn the cam on for your stream so he can look at your face.

4533
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:47,880
I'm up here.

4534
02:37:47,940 --> 02:37:48,260
Watch out.

4535
02:37:50,780 --> 02:37:51,520
Blank purple now.

4536
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:53,300
Got purple too.

4537
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:57,200
One guy on the right here.

4538
02:37:58,120 --> 02:37:58,360
Yeah.

4539
02:37:58,620 --> 02:38:00,340
We really have the best play.

4540
02:38:00,460 --> 02:38:00,820
They're back.

4541
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:02,600
I'm batting quick.

4542
02:38:03,740 --> 02:38:05,760
Oh, he's getting shot at by a different team.

4543
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:07,820
By a team to our right.

4544
02:38:07,860 --> 02:38:08,200
They're going left.

4545
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:08,480
They're going left.

4546
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:11,360
Oh yeah, one guy's late.

4547
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:12,000
Bang.

4548
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:13,400
Yeah, I'm shooting him.

4549
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:14,140
In a second.

4550
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:15,740
He already, like, crossed.

4551
02:38:16,280 --> 02:38:16,640
Yeah.

4552
02:38:17,540 --> 02:38:19,700
Bro, why are they all running away?

4553
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:20,980
Dude, there's still 20 teams.

4554
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:22,780
Everybody's, like, fucking cowards.

4555
02:38:22,840 --> 02:38:23,560
Yeah, I'm commencing him.

4556
02:38:25,300 --> 02:38:26,280
Some bats here.

4557
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:29,020
They're going to hide.

4558
02:38:29,020 --> 02:38:30,140
They're all like, holy shit.

4559
02:38:30,420 --> 02:38:30,780
Oh,

4560
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:35,780
there's a team here.

4561
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:36,820
Where's the end, though?

4562
02:38:37,520 --> 02:38:38,460
It's like, uh...

4563
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:40,300
I mean, they're playing bridge.

4564
02:38:42,560 --> 02:38:44,280
I don't think you want to fight bridge.

4565
02:38:46,140 --> 02:38:47,700
It's an iso 5 maybe here if you want to.

4566
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:48,560
Yeah, let's go.

4567
02:38:48,940 --> 02:38:49,300
Alright.

4568
02:38:51,460 --> 02:38:52,140
Nobody's near us.

4569
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,340
Like, bridge team is the closest team.

4570
02:38:54,740 --> 02:38:55,820
There's a charge rifle.

4571
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:57,160
Is that dragon's team?

4572
02:38:57,920 --> 02:38:58,580
Nah, I doubt it.

4573
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:01,260
I was going to say, because it's charge rifle.

4574
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:04,040
Three kills with a charge rifle, you know?

4575
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:05,000
That's how it works.

4576
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:08,180
It's a Rampart.

4577
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:09,800
Yeah, me too.

4578
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:10,640
I'm hiding.

4579
02:39:13,820 --> 02:39:15,540
Can you smoke the...

4580
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:16,000
I did.

4581
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:17,380
Yeah.

4582
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:17,620
Bang, open.

4583
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:19,100
You can stay tip him here, maybe.

4584
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:19,680
Yeah.

4585
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:20,280
I'm dodging bangle.

4586
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:21,460
I'm fucking...

4587
02:39:21,460 --> 02:39:22,300
I'm fucking...

4588
02:39:22,300 --> 02:39:22,580
I think.

4589
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:24,760
Bro, my gun is not shooting.

4590
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:25,340
I have.

4591
02:39:25,340 --> 02:39:25,800
Should be fine.

4592
02:39:25,880 --> 02:39:26,140
I'm roof.

4593
02:39:28,420 --> 02:39:28,960
I peek here?

4594
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:30,860
I don't know if I can make it.

4595
02:39:30,900 --> 02:39:32,240
Yeah, my shield is not going to make it.

4596
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:34,600
What?

4597
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:37,380
I'm looking for you.

4598
02:39:37,380 --> 02:39:38,200
That thing is crazy, bro.

4599
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:39,340
That's not good.

4600
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:40,060
That's not good.

4601
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:40,840
That's not good at all.

4602
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:41,780
Can I even get to you?

4603
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:43,200
No.

4604
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:44,900
I think you just craft me.

4605
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:45,400
Just leave on the way.

4606
02:39:45,420 --> 02:39:45,620
Okay.

4607
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:45,900
Maybe...

4608
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:46,600
Alright.

4609
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:48,140
Just go craft there and rest.

4610
02:39:48,660 --> 02:39:49,100
Yeah, yeah.

4611
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:49,660
I think you just craft me.

4612
02:39:49,660 --> 02:39:50,260
On the ping.

4613
02:39:51,720 --> 02:39:52,240
Yeah, yeah.

4614
02:39:52,480 --> 02:39:53,200
Holy shit.

4615
02:39:53,300 --> 02:39:53,500
Oh, that's...

4616
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:56,020
I don't know if they're going to push me now because this is isolated.

4617
02:39:56,020 --> 02:39:56,460
No, no, no.

4618
02:39:56,540 --> 02:39:57,020
You're fine.

4619
02:39:57,140 --> 02:39:57,460
You're fine.

4620
02:39:57,520 --> 02:39:57,780
You're fine.

4621
02:39:57,880 --> 02:39:58,080
You're fine.

4622
02:39:58,400 --> 02:39:59,300
Holy shit.

4623
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:00,760
You guys died so fast.

4624
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:02,640
I died to a different team.

4625
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:03,660
There was a guy next to me already.

4626
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:05,100
That's unlucky.

4627
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:06,620
It's fine.

4628
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:08,000
You can easy craft there.

4629
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:08,500
Yeah.

4630
02:40:08,520 --> 02:40:08,780
That's unlucky.

4631
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:09,160
Unlucky.

4632
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:10,160
Yeah.

4633
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:10,480
Unlucky.

4634
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:10,760
Unlucky.

4635
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:12,020
I'm alive.

4636
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:15,920
Yeah.

4637
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:16,900
You're fine.

4638
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,360
I got pinged so bad.

4639
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:19,640
Yeah.

4640
02:40:19,660 --> 02:40:21,160
Bro, I got shielded the fuck out, bro.

4641
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:21,440
Yeah.

4642
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:23,860
I was like, what the f...

4643
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:28,600
That shit was crazy.

4644
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:30,120
You guys fucking died, died.

4645
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:31,220
Now we have no loot, though.

4646
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:32,480
So this is a little scary.

4647
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:33,760
Yup.

4648
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:35,820
Kind of chocked.

4649
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:36,620
It's fine.

4650
02:40:36,700 --> 02:40:38,720
We have one fight and we're reviving.

4651
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:40,780
I don't know if they...

4652
02:40:40,780 --> 02:40:41,220
Okay.

4653
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:41,960
Our team didn't commit.

4654
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:42,780
I think.

4655
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:43,040
Yeah.

4656
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:43,520
They're not fighting.

4657
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:44,080
Yeah.

4658
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:45,080
Walking off zone a little bit, though.

4659
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:46,680
He's coming to charge rifle effect, I think.

4660
02:40:47,340 --> 02:40:47,700
Okay.

4661
02:40:48,560 --> 02:40:48,920
Damn.

4662
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:49,640
Yeah.

4663
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:50,040
I see the bank.

4664
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:51,660
He does not like you.

4665
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:56,360
I hear a car.

4666
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:57,240
Car is...

4667
02:40:57,240 --> 02:40:57,660
Oh, wait.

4668
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:58,280
Actually, no.

4669
02:40:58,320 --> 02:40:58,460
Sorry.

4670
02:40:58,500 --> 02:40:58,980
That's the zone.

4671
02:40:59,120 --> 02:40:59,620
Never mind.

4672
02:41:00,460 --> 02:41:01,440
I thought that was a car.

4673
02:41:01,660 --> 02:41:03,440
I know that because there was a car to our right.

4674
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:04,720
So it, like, paranoid me.

4675
02:41:09,160 --> 02:41:10,020
Paranoia is hitting.

4676
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:11,220
I'm hearing voices.

4677
02:41:12,700 --> 02:41:13,060
Same.

4678
02:41:13,220 --> 02:41:13,720
Every day.

4679
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:14,560
Oh, shit.

4680
02:41:14,900 --> 02:41:15,720
You okay, man?

4681
02:41:15,740 --> 02:41:15,940
You got med kit?

4682
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:17,000
I do.

4683
02:41:17,200 --> 02:41:17,460
Yeah.

4684
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:18,440
This is my last med kit.

4685
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:18,720
You have it?

4686
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:19,040
Yeah.

4687
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:19,620
You have it?

4688
02:41:19,620 --> 02:41:20,400
You can syringe.

4689
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:21,140
You have a lot of syringes now.

4690
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:21,860
I have five.

4691
02:41:21,880 --> 02:41:22,640
I have four, but...

4692
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:23,400
Yeah, I dropped...

4693
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:23,800
I got...

4694
02:41:23,800 --> 02:41:24,820
I dropped the med kit.

4695
02:41:24,980 --> 02:41:25,760
It's my last one, but...

4696
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:26,100
Any syringes?

4697
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:28,000
Nope.

4698
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:28,680
Oh, yeah.

4699
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:30,900
I have four, so...

4700
02:41:30,900 --> 02:41:31,280
Bro.

4701
02:41:31,360 --> 02:41:31,660
Oh, yeah.

4702
02:41:31,660 --> 02:41:31,900
There's more.

4703
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:32,660
There's more syringes here.

4704
02:41:33,480 --> 02:41:33,800
Yeah.

4705
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:34,080
That's good.

4706
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:36,280
All right.

4707
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:36,940
Let's wait for the...

4708
02:41:38,620 --> 02:41:39,620
Loot bin reset as well.

4709
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:40,720
Open every bin here.

4710
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:42,420
I don't know if they're already open.

4711
02:41:44,140 --> 02:41:46,160
I got two shields now because of that bitch with charge rifle.

4712
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:47,460
Damn.

4713
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:50,280
Fuck that guy.

4714
02:41:50,480 --> 02:41:51,360
Yeah, he's just shooting.

4715
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:53,180
Extended sniper mag here.

4716
02:41:53,360 --> 02:41:54,020
Level two.

4717
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:57,260
I just don't know if there's just, like, people on the other side.

4718
02:41:57,380 --> 02:41:58,160
Can we hit the UV, maybe?

4719
02:41:59,120 --> 02:41:59,560
Again?

4720
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:00,160
You cannot?

4721
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:02,280
You can only get once, right?

4722
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:02,820
I hit that already?

4723
02:42:04,220 --> 02:42:04,980
When did I hit that?

4724
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:07,140
When we found that team.

4725
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:09,660
What the hell?

4726
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:11,700
The reason why we chased that team.

4727
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:12,640
Skippity cooked, man.

4728
02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:13,460
Yeah.

4729
02:42:13,460 --> 02:42:15,180
Skippity cooked you guys so hard.

4730
02:42:16,480 --> 02:42:16,920
Yeah.

4731
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:17,440
Yeah.

4732
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:19,540
Well, where is it with the zone?

4733
02:42:21,280 --> 02:42:22,620
Bro, I just fucking...

4734
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:23,200
I have bat.

4735
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:24,440
Do you want the bat?

4736
02:42:24,620 --> 02:42:24,680
Fine.

4737
02:42:25,020 --> 02:42:25,340
Okay.

4738
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:26,380
Oh, you got your bin here.

4739
02:42:26,740 --> 02:42:27,240
Can you smoke?

4740
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:36,560
Yeah, we got to be conservative with our loot.

4741
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:42,620
I mean, can we not play in this gap here with Newcastle?

4742
02:42:43,340 --> 02:42:43,780
Yeah, sure.

4743
02:42:43,960 --> 02:42:44,500
Then go out late?

4744
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:45,180
Maybe?

4745
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:46,700
And then free people with a zipline or something on the left?

4746
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:47,940
All right.

4747
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:48,600
I'm heading over.

4748
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:49,220
Watch out from here.

4749
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:50,080
Yeah.

4750
02:42:52,400 --> 02:42:53,180
Someone close here.

4751
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:54,220
I think there's somebody in the gap already.

4752
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:54,400
Come.

4753
02:42:54,760 --> 02:42:55,140
I'm here.

4754
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:55,340
I'm here.

4755
02:42:55,540 --> 02:42:55,860
Close.

4756
02:42:58,700 --> 02:42:59,500
I hear them.

4757
02:42:59,520 --> 02:42:59,640
Yeah.

4758
02:42:59,640 --> 02:43:00,300
They're right next to you.

4759
02:43:00,300 --> 02:43:00,400
I'm peeking.

4760
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:00,660
I'm peeking.

4761
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:00,800
Yeah.

4762
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:02,740
I'm peeking.

4763
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:03,620
I'm peeking.

4764
02:43:03,800 --> 02:43:04,120
I'm peeking.

4765
02:43:04,120 --> 02:43:04,220
Yeah.

4766
02:43:04,220 --> 02:43:04,640
Well cucked.

4767
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:04,980
Yeah.

4768
02:43:04,980 --> 02:43:05,340
Well cucked.

4769
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:06,160
I'm pushing.

4770
02:43:07,060 --> 02:43:07,380
I'm peeking.

4771
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:07,980
I'm peeking.

4772
02:43:08,320 --> 02:43:08,640
I'm peeking.

4773
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:09,780
I'm peeking.

4774
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:10,500
I'm peeking.

4775
02:43:14,720 --> 02:43:15,360
I'm peeking.

4776
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:15,440
Cucked.

4777
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:15,560
Oh, I got a shield here.

4778
02:43:16,260 --> 02:43:16,540
Okay.

4779
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:17,140
We gotta watch our back though.

4780
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:17,880
Yeah.

4781
02:43:18,640 --> 02:43:19,020
Looked at it?

4782
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:20,500
Yeah.

4783
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:21,880
I'm looting.

4784
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:23,000
Yeah.

4785
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:25,140
So many bats and there's MET kits too.

4786
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:25,960
I have three...

4787
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:26,940
I have six bats.

4788
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:27,740
Does anyone want them?

4789
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:28,300
There's four here.

4790
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:30,500
I need a MET kit without.

4791
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:31,640
We just hold here, okay?

4792
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:33,740
Let's hold here out until last second and then we just play.

4793
02:43:33,960 --> 02:43:34,240
Okay.

4794
02:43:35,100 --> 02:43:36,820
Like, there just may be free people left or right.

4795
02:43:37,380 --> 02:43:37,940
Sorry, that's...

4796
02:43:38,540 --> 02:43:39,200
No, no team...

4797
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:40,020
Oh, shit.

4798
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:41,500
Oh, my God.

4799
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:43,660
I need a bat, I need a bat.

4800
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:44,260
I'm out to the zipper.

4801
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:47,520
I'm going to ult here?

4802
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:48,220
I'm going to ult now.

4803
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:49,480
Yeah.

4804
02:43:49,620 --> 02:43:49,940
Yeah.

4805
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:53,980
Yeah, I'm a bitch bro.

4806
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:55,540
Oh shit, I lost my other thing here.

4807
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:56,380
Yeah, you can rest with me.

4808
02:43:58,280 --> 02:43:59,260
Can I dress you?

4809
02:43:59,280 --> 02:43:59,860
Oh no!

4810
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:01,980
Such a bitch man.

4811
02:44:03,740 --> 02:44:04,860
I think there's a mob in the middle.

4812
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:07,240
I'm going to double check.

4813
02:44:07,420 --> 02:44:07,520
I'm checking.

4814
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:10,580
No, there's an evac.

4815
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:12,740
No, they only have evac.

4816
02:44:12,740 --> 02:44:13,400
I saw one.

4817
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:16,900
Evac ulted?

4818
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:17,920
Yeah.

4819
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:19,560
They're not coming though.

4820
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:20,500
Are we in?

4821
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:22,080
The respawn on the left is on the left, right?

4822
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:24,440
Yeah, but I don't know if we could get that.

4823
02:44:24,480 --> 02:44:24,940
Yeah, you're in.

4824
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:27,020
Team down there, we're not safe.

4825
02:44:27,220 --> 02:44:27,980
Wait, look bro.

4826
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:28,520
Look at this.

4827
02:44:28,620 --> 02:44:29,180
Can you go left?

4828
02:44:29,240 --> 02:44:29,600
Can you go left?

4829
02:44:29,660 --> 02:44:29,900
Come, come, come.

4830
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:30,680
Yeah, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

4831
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:32,940
Oh, ready?

4832
02:44:34,180 --> 02:44:34,960
No smokes, no smokes.

4833
02:44:36,420 --> 02:44:37,620
They're fighting, that's why we need to go.

4834
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:38,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4835
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:38,820
Can you come?

4836
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:40,980
Yeah, I'm shielding and I'm heading over now.

4837
02:44:41,720 --> 02:44:42,460
Watch out the logon.

4838
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:43,200
I have Q, I have Q.

4839
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:44,660
Nice, just go, just go.

4840
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:45,920
Let's zip up.

4841
02:44:47,320 --> 02:44:48,540
Need to watch out on the res though.

4842
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:53,030
Just going top too.

4843
02:44:53,930 --> 02:44:54,290
Let's go.

4844
02:44:56,370 --> 02:44:57,390
Q, on top, full team.

4845
02:44:58,030 --> 02:44:58,390
Bangalore.

4846
02:44:59,530 --> 02:45:00,290
Bangalore, Bangalore low.

4847
02:45:00,490 --> 02:45:01,270
It's only two up there.

4848
02:45:02,010 --> 02:45:02,710
Yeah, oh.

4849
02:45:04,170 --> 02:45:04,690
I'm batting.

4850
02:45:05,010 --> 02:45:05,550
You too.

4851
02:45:05,890 --> 02:45:06,150
100.

4852
02:45:06,810 --> 02:45:07,950
I have the bat, the bat.

4853
02:45:09,530 --> 02:45:10,790
I'm tanking, I have to tank this.

4854
02:45:11,750 --> 02:45:12,870
Yeah, they're looking at it.

4855
02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:13,770
I'm dropping.

4856
02:45:14,230 --> 02:45:15,110
On us below.

4857
02:45:17,270 --> 02:45:18,090
On the right side.

4858
02:45:18,590 --> 02:45:20,290
Yeah, I'm getting shot from behind too.

4859
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:27,940
We're dead.

4860
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:28,940
We're all dead.

4861
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:31,200
No!

4862
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:35,600
Yeah, we should...

4863
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:37,140
Yeah, that res was too risky.

4864
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:40,600
That was my bad.

4865
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:41,980
I just forgot about the fucking bridge team.

4866
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:45,580
That res was so fucked.

4867
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:56,740
Oh my god, I fucking forgot this bridge team was like switch angles for me dude.

4868
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:59,780
Top 17 bro, like we cannot fight, they were just running away from us.

4869
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:00,520
Yeah.

4870
02:46:01,020 --> 02:46:04,020
Yeah, when I died I realized that we were the first team to kill someone.

4871
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:07,660
It was top 20 when we killed that team and then it was 19.

4872
02:46:07,900 --> 02:46:09,400
Nobody wants to fight.

4873
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:11,860
It's actually crazy dude.

4874
02:46:12,060 --> 02:46:13,840
We just play zone again or what?

4875
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:16,860
Nah, we need to be more faster.

4876
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:17,760
Okay.

4877
02:46:18,480 --> 02:46:20,540
We need to take care from Ekko.

4878
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:24,040
Yeah, let's just wait quick and then we'll kill Ekko.

4879
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:24,660
Okay.

4880
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:25,260
Yeah, yeah.

4881
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:29,900
That's crazy, everybody just does... everybody's are pussies.

4882
02:46:32,700 --> 02:46:34,540
Running a lot away, I don't know why.

4883
02:46:35,820 --> 02:46:40,720
Yeah, I had so many... I have... oh my god, so many different people shot me.

4884
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:43,720
One, two, three, four, five.

4885
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:43,820
One, two, three, four, five.

4886
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:51,920
Five, five... wait, one, two, three, four, five, five, six.

4887
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:54,820
That's a new Pathfinder.

4888
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:56,920
Oh my god.

4889
02:46:56,960 --> 02:46:59,980
I had six different people fight me, holy shit.

4890
02:47:06,500 --> 02:47:10,320
I think it's just... it'll just be like that.

4891
02:47:10,420 --> 02:47:11,220
It's okay, we got two games.

4892
02:47:17,010 --> 02:47:18,710
It's things like my brain is just not working.

4893
02:47:19,050 --> 02:47:19,830
I'm overheating.

4894
02:47:20,670 --> 02:47:21,410
Oh no.

4895
02:47:21,750 --> 02:47:23,210
No, don't overheat.

4896
02:47:24,950 --> 02:47:25,390
Think!

4897
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:28,050
I might be getting... I might be getting fever out here right now, can't lie.

4898
02:47:28,070 --> 02:47:28,410
No!

4899
02:47:28,970 --> 02:47:30,390
I thought you were getting better!

4900
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:32,130
I thought so too.

4901
02:47:32,550 --> 02:47:33,410
What happened?

4902
02:47:36,330 --> 02:47:38,250
You were supposed to recover.

4903
02:47:39,690 --> 02:47:40,450
Yeah, I know.

4904
02:47:40,530 --> 02:47:41,210
I was supposed to.

4905
02:47:43,530 --> 02:47:43,970
Sadgers.

4906
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:45,510
What happened to you?

4907
02:47:48,050 --> 02:47:48,490
Life.

4908
02:47:49,050 --> 02:47:49,730
I'm gonna grab a snack.

4909
02:47:49,890 --> 02:47:50,090
Oh shit.

4910
02:47:51,130 --> 02:47:51,650
I'm gonna grab a snack.

4911
02:47:51,650 --> 02:47:52,830
Okay, we have two more games.

4912
02:47:54,090 --> 02:47:54,670
Two more?

4913
02:47:55,290 --> 02:47:56,650
No, we're watching that team.

4914
02:47:57,170 --> 02:47:58,750
Bro, it was that team that we fucked.

4915
02:47:58,950 --> 02:48:01,810
I literally made this Bangalow 1HP so many times.

4916
02:48:03,250 --> 02:48:03,670
Yikes.

4917
02:48:03,910 --> 02:48:04,250
No way.

4918
02:48:05,710 --> 02:48:07,610
And they were the team that was running away from us.

4919
02:48:07,870 --> 02:48:08,130
Yeah.

4920
02:48:09,390 --> 02:48:10,070
That's unlucky.

4921
02:48:13,110 --> 02:48:14,190
Those little bitches.

4922
02:48:14,730 --> 02:48:15,250
Alright, we're back.

4923
02:48:15,450 --> 02:48:18,730
We were just unlucky as we were stuck between two teams when we won a res.

4924
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:21,790
Nobody let us res.

4925
02:48:21,910 --> 02:48:25,010
Everybody was so mean to us.

4926
02:48:26,370 --> 02:48:26,910
Nope.

4927
02:48:29,310 --> 02:48:31,430
He freaked too close to the sun.

4928
02:48:31,630 --> 02:48:32,590
He needs to stop.

4929
02:48:37,590 --> 02:48:41,690
We gotta lower our freaking level if we want to survive.

4930
02:48:42,010 --> 02:48:44,230
We gotta lower the freak levels.

4931
02:48:46,770 --> 02:48:49,270
Between three teams, a rock and a hard place.

4932
02:48:49,350 --> 02:48:49,650
Yeah.

4933
02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:54,370
As long as we do well in the next two games, we should be okay.

4934
02:48:54,710 --> 02:48:55,710
We might get top three.

4935
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:09,480
I mean, we're doing really well for throwing a lot of games.

4936
02:49:11,440 --> 02:49:11,860
Yeah.

4937
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:13,580
We need to get another banger.

4938
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:17,560
Yeah, we just need one big banger and then we're good to go.

4939
02:49:17,960 --> 02:49:18,880
We can relax.

4940
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:24,080
Someone's like, you're just not freaking enough.

4941
02:49:26,160 --> 02:49:29,160
No, don't tone it down, you gotta commit now.

4942
02:49:30,980 --> 02:49:33,480
I think this team... I think the team we're watching might win.

4943
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:36,620
Yeah, it's uh, the first place team.

4944
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:38,840
Oh, is that... is that Dragon's team?

4945
02:49:39,240 --> 02:49:40,140
I think so.

4946
02:49:40,300 --> 02:49:41,760
Oh, it is... it is...

4947
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,240
Yeah, yeah, it's Dragon's team.

4948
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:45,600
Your play's so sweaty!

4949
02:49:46,380 --> 02:49:47,520
Turned off your brain!

4950
02:49:49,700 --> 02:49:50,440
For real.

4951
02:49:50,660 --> 02:49:51,600
Turn it off!

4952
02:50:04,240 --> 02:50:05,420
The worst is just getting to play.

4953
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:05,860
Just to wait.

4954
02:50:08,060 --> 02:50:09,620
Waiting is so hard.

4955
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:18,740
But it's entertaining if they're sweaty.

4956
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:23,720
No, I'm the main character.

4957
02:50:24,100 --> 02:50:26,300
Our team should be the only team sweaty.

4958
02:50:34,640 --> 02:50:35,840
That's how it should go.

4959
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:40,340
Alright, now entertain three people's chats.

4960
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:46,100
No, actually you guys should entertain me.

4961
02:50:46,340 --> 02:50:47,540
Why am I entertaining?

4962
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:52,340
I'm sick here.

4963
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:53,300
I should be entertained.

4964
02:50:56,480 --> 02:50:59,420
Honestly, I think it's just the fact that like...

4965
02:51:01,060 --> 02:51:02,600
The fact that like...

4966
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:05,820
We're just too freaky for this game.

4967
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:08,100
No, we're freaky.

4968
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:09,980
You're the streamer, bro.

4969
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:11,600
Well, I want to reverse it.

4970
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:12,820
I'm sick.

4971
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:15,400
So like, I should get like a...

4972
02:51:15,400 --> 02:51:17,140
I should get like a plus one.

4973
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:20,500
A plus one chat entertains the streamers.

4974
02:51:20,840 --> 02:51:21,480
I do.

4975
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:22,300
I'm taking medic...

4976
02:51:22,300 --> 02:51:23,580
That's why I've been using the bathroom a lot.

4977
02:51:23,620 --> 02:51:24,680
I've been hydrating a lot too.

4978
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:26,420
So that's why I've been using the bathroom a lot.

4979
02:51:28,460 --> 02:51:31,780
Because I need to fucking hydrate from all the...

4980
02:51:32,540 --> 02:51:35,400
From trying to, you know, replenish my liquids.

4981
02:51:38,780 --> 02:51:39,820
I don't know.

4982
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:39,880
I don't know why I'm doing this right now.

4983
02:51:39,880 --> 02:51:40,840
It's too much to handle.

4984
02:51:40,960 --> 02:51:42,140
Yeah, we're just too much.

4985
02:51:42,200 --> 02:51:43,680
We're too much to handle.

4986
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:48,200
It's crazy though that everybody's running and not fighting.

4987
02:51:48,420 --> 02:51:49,740
Which is understandable.

4988
02:51:50,100 --> 02:51:52,160
Like, this is like a tournament format.

4989
02:51:52,380 --> 02:51:53,300
So like, people...

4990
02:51:53,300 --> 02:51:54,860
I really, really want to win.

4991
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:57,120
Like, I want to win.

4992
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:59,300
But, like, not that.

4993
02:52:00,240 --> 02:52:01,280
Not that.

4994
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:02,580
Like, I want to win.

4995
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:05,520
But I'm too sick right now to have that feeling.

4996
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:11,820
I'm too sick to feel that right now at a more intense feeling.

4997
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:13,640
I'm just... I want to survive.

4998
02:52:13,800 --> 02:52:15,400
That's all I feel right now.

4999
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:17,560
I just... I want to survive.

5000
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:24,700
Number one.

5001
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:26,000
They got 13th with second.

5002
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:26,540
GG's.

5003
02:52:26,680 --> 02:52:27,520
I think they win.

5004
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:30,580
Oh yeah, Monsoon's team or...

5005
02:52:31,260 --> 02:52:32,080
Is it Monsoon?

5006
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:32,740
No, enemies.

5007
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:35,980
I forgot Monsoon couldn't make it, so enemies...

5008
02:52:36,540 --> 02:52:38,340
Yeah, I think they're going to be first place.

5009
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:39,040
Yeah, I think they're going to be first place.

5010
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:39,780
Oh hey, Skippity!

5011
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:40,760
Your favorite!

5012
02:52:41,060 --> 02:52:42,220
And Skippity is third!

5013
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:43,960
They're farming too, what the f...

5014
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:48,240
The team is golden.

5015
02:52:48,700 --> 02:52:50,780
Oh my god, go Skippity!

5016
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:53,880
I wore it.

5017
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:57,440
And it said it's going to be delivered in like 50 minutes.

5018
02:52:57,680 --> 02:52:58,480
And I got it in 20.

5019
02:52:58,960 --> 02:52:59,400
Nice.

5020
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:00,280
Yay!

5021
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:01,420
I mean, not nice.

5022
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:01,980
Not nice.

5023
02:53:02,220 --> 02:53:04,620
Yeah, yeah!

5024
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:05,820
They're late!

5025
02:53:08,800 --> 02:53:10,940
That's the first time when I'm not happy with the first delivery.

5026
02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:13,180
Oh my god.

5027
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:14,460
Bro.

5028
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:15,180
What?

5029
02:53:15,280 --> 02:53:16,380
You're not even EU!

5030
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:17,640
You guys don't need it!

5031
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:20,280
Dragon, you don't need it!

5032
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:20,900
You're not EU!

5033
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:23,280
Give some love to the EU!

5034
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:23,940
Give some love to the EU players!

5035
02:53:26,480 --> 02:53:28,160
They need that $175!

5036
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:33,720
Damn.

5037
02:53:35,260 --> 02:53:37,060
Look, guys.

5038
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:38,760
If I... If we...

5039
02:53:38,760 --> 02:53:40,540
I don't think we're going to cash up to them, but...

5040
02:53:42,180 --> 02:53:48,500
But if we somehow make it to first place, I will donate my prize winnings to Effect and...

5041
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:50,160
Effect and Unlucky.

5042
02:53:51,180 --> 02:53:52,980
I thought you were going to set the choice.

5043
02:53:53,300 --> 02:53:53,440
Yeah.

5044
02:53:53,660 --> 02:53:54,920
It is charity.

5045
02:53:55,240 --> 02:53:56,940
It is.

5046
02:53:57,240 --> 02:53:58,120
But it is.

5047
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:05,020
It is charity.

5048
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:05,860
What do you mean?

5049
02:54:06,900 --> 02:54:08,620
I'm helping the EU...

5050
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:10,160
The EU talents out.

5051
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:12,320
One...

5052
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:14,360
One donation at a time.

5053
02:54:19,230 --> 02:54:20,550
Oh my god.

5054
02:54:20,570 --> 02:54:22,030
The EU pros charity.

5055
02:54:22,090 --> 02:54:22,730
Exactly.

5056
02:54:23,250 --> 02:54:26,410
We're here to help the EU pro charity.

5057
02:54:27,030 --> 02:54:28,630
Alright, I'm going to use the bathroom again.

5058
02:54:28,850 --> 02:54:30,150
Alright, entertaining my chat.

5059
02:54:30,410 --> 02:54:31,450
And Unlucky's chat.

5060
02:54:31,730 --> 02:54:32,630
Where the fuck is Unlucky?

5061
02:54:32,750 --> 02:54:34,110
Is he back in the bathroom?

5062
02:54:34,790 --> 02:54:35,510
I guess.

5063
02:54:35,990 --> 02:54:37,250
He's on the sticky time again.

5064
02:54:37,450 --> 02:54:37,990
Oh my god.

5065
02:54:38,170 --> 02:54:39,030
Twice in a row?

5066
02:54:39,330 --> 02:54:39,670
Jeez.

5067
02:54:40,150 --> 02:54:41,090
Okay, I'll be right back.

5068
02:54:42,190 --> 02:54:42,670
Bro.

5069
02:54:46,730 --> 02:54:50,130
I, that ass, fell asleep on the fucking couch in the fucking living room.

5070
02:54:52,170 --> 02:54:52,530
Understandable.

5071
02:54:52,850 --> 02:54:53,810
I, dude...

5072
02:54:56,490 --> 02:54:57,170
Oh my god.

5073
02:54:57,270 --> 02:54:58,190
I woke up.

5074
02:54:58,850 --> 02:54:59,670
I woke up.

5075
02:54:59,890 --> 02:55:00,950
I was like...

5076
02:55:02,130 --> 02:55:03,170
And I'm like...

5077
02:55:03,590 --> 02:55:04,830
Wait, the game's not ready?

5078
02:55:05,070 --> 02:55:06,590
I'm like, oh shit, what the fuck is going on?

5079
02:55:06,670 --> 02:55:08,410
I was so confused.

5080
02:55:08,910 --> 02:55:10,010
I was like, oh my god, okay.

5081
02:55:10,130 --> 02:55:10,830
It's endgame still.

5082
02:55:12,690 --> 02:55:17,030
I actually passed out like two minutes for like a grandpa and I came back and I felt like... I don't know.

5083
02:55:17,470 --> 02:55:18,450
Did it feel like ten hours?

5084
02:55:19,190 --> 02:55:19,550
Yes.

5085
02:55:20,130 --> 02:55:20,430
It was bad.

5086
02:55:20,650 --> 02:55:21,770
Bro, what the fuck, man?

5087
02:55:23,950 --> 02:55:25,370
Well, I got my food, like...

5088
02:55:25,370 --> 02:55:28,630
He said delivery's gonna be in fifteen minutes and I got it in twenty.

5089
02:55:30,570 --> 02:55:32,010
Oh, you ordered food at this time?

5090
02:55:32,550 --> 02:55:32,910
Yeah.

5091
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:34,070
Yeah, bro.

5092
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:35,670
I was like...

5093
02:55:35,670 --> 02:55:38,110
Yeah, I'm gonna order pizza and watch some anime.

5094
02:55:38,750 --> 02:55:39,110
Mhm.

5095
02:55:39,330 --> 02:55:41,630
And I got it now when we have two more games, man.

5096
02:55:41,730 --> 02:55:43,270
Why did we vote for the seventh one, man?

5097
02:55:44,690 --> 02:55:46,070
Yeah, I don't know who voted for that one.

5098
02:55:50,210 --> 02:55:53,210
I personally only voted for it because I thought the first one doesn't count.

5099
02:55:53,770 --> 02:55:54,830
Same, to be honest.

5100
02:55:55,570 --> 02:55:57,190
I was like, nah, let's play more.

5101
02:55:57,430 --> 02:55:58,470
I don't want to regret it.

5102
02:55:59,210 --> 02:56:00,650
I'm just so cooked, like...

5103
02:56:01,110 --> 02:56:02,070
It's just so bad.

5104
02:56:02,430 --> 02:56:04,470
I think it's like...

5105
02:56:05,990 --> 02:56:08,070
Mechanics-wise and shit, I'm calm, you know?

5106
02:56:08,190 --> 02:56:10,070
But brain-wise, I'm so cooked.

5107
02:56:10,410 --> 02:56:15,010
Like, even this peak where I got killed by the British team, it was so obvious.

5108
02:56:15,150 --> 02:56:15,650
I'm just cooked.

5109
02:56:15,790 --> 02:56:16,890
I can't think.

5110
02:56:16,910 --> 02:56:17,790
You're just not thinking?

5111
02:56:18,830 --> 02:56:19,250
Yeah.

5112
02:56:19,250 --> 02:56:20,050
It's alright.

5113
02:56:20,210 --> 02:56:22,150
We'll have Effect IGL for us.

5114
02:56:24,090 --> 02:56:25,990
That's... that's not the best thing you could ask for.

5115
02:56:25,990 --> 02:56:26,450
Oh, okay.

5116
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:30,510
Okay, that's not... We'll have... Is Hakkas like, awake right now?

5117
02:56:30,510 --> 02:56:31,590
Could we call him to coach?

5118
02:56:33,090 --> 02:56:35,810
Let's call Hakkas to coach us right now.

5119
02:56:37,150 --> 02:56:38,430
There's no rules against it.

5120
02:56:39,030 --> 02:56:40,130
Get his ass in here.

5121
02:56:40,370 --> 02:56:43,450
Yeah, get his ass in here and coach.

5122
02:56:43,450 --> 02:56:43,970
Fucking unk.

5123
02:56:46,190 --> 02:56:47,830
I can't even breathe, man.

5124
02:56:47,970 --> 02:56:48,410
Breathe.

5125
02:56:50,610 --> 02:56:55,070
I mean, there's no rules against, like, outside coaching while we play.

5126
02:56:56,070 --> 02:56:56,510
Damn.

5127
02:56:58,390 --> 02:56:59,910
All I'm saying...

5128
02:57:01,670 --> 02:57:05,410
I think if we win first, we could have a chance to get second.

5129
02:57:06,470 --> 02:57:08,090
If we have one first place game.

5130
02:57:09,850 --> 02:57:10,690
Yeah, plus it.

5131
02:57:13,980 --> 02:57:14,640
It's okay.

5132
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:19,400
Sounds so easy, right?

5133
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:20,920
Yeah, so easy.

5134
02:57:21,180 --> 02:57:22,660
I mean, you guys have done it before.

5135
02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:24,240
Like, you could do it again.

5136
02:57:25,540 --> 02:57:28,420
You could do it again.

5137
02:57:30,560 --> 02:57:31,360
I believe.

5138
02:57:32,260 --> 02:57:33,300
Should I hop on Nagi?

5139
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:33,760
Or Valk?

5140
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:35,620
Should I actually play Valk?

5141
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:36,820
I feel like I should.

5142
02:57:38,260 --> 02:57:38,880
Do it.

5143
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:41,340
If you do Valk, should I do Bangalore then?

5144
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:42,520
You could.

5145
02:57:44,280 --> 02:57:45,600
Yeah, you can just fuck Newcastle.

5146
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:47,660
Yeah, fuck the Newcastle.

5147
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:48,460
Alright.

5148
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:50,680
We're not playing zone for the Wolves, you know?

5149
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:51,360
Alright.

5150
02:57:51,960 --> 02:57:52,360
Okay.

5151
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:55,700
And then this next game, we're gonna get so fucked over because we had no Newcastle.

5152
02:57:56,980 --> 02:57:57,420
Yeah.

5153
02:57:58,560 --> 02:58:02,060
It's gonna be like the most open area and then we're... Yeah, I'm like...

5154
02:58:02,060 --> 02:58:03,320
Yeah bro, we need a wall, dude.

5155
02:58:04,180 --> 02:58:06,080
We have to kill a team for their wall.

5156
02:58:06,300 --> 02:58:08,440
Like, that's the only... True, by the team...

5157
02:58:08,440 --> 02:58:10,000
That game, we won the Newcastle.

5158
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:10,920
Yeah, true, true.

5159
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:12,600
We take their walls.

5160
02:58:12,960 --> 02:58:14,000
We take their...

5161
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:14,620
Yeah.

5162
02:58:17,400 --> 02:58:18,060
It's fine.

5163
02:58:24,880 --> 02:58:25,740
This is it.

5164
02:58:25,740 --> 02:58:26,500
This is... Don't worry.

5165
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:27,060
This is it.

5166
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:27,840
We figure out...

5167
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:30,260
Now we know our actual comp.

5168
02:58:31,080 --> 02:58:31,560
Now...

5169
02:58:32,400 --> 02:58:32,880
Now...

5170
02:58:33,580 --> 02:58:35,220
Now we know our real comp.

5171
02:58:36,800 --> 02:58:38,320
I'm just playing fucking Wraith, dude.

5172
02:58:39,400 --> 02:58:40,080
Good luck.

5173
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:41,400
Yes.

5174
02:58:41,800 --> 02:58:43,600
Oh, you're gonna get Wraith?

5175
02:58:45,260 --> 02:58:45,740
What?

5176
02:58:52,790 --> 02:58:54,770
I like how Effect doesn't even respond back.

5177
02:58:54,890 --> 02:58:55,630
He's just...

5178
02:58:56,330 --> 02:58:58,410
He's just... Yeah, that's what I said.

5179
02:59:01,070 --> 02:59:04,790
Are we actually playing two game... Are we actually playing more than one game?

5180
02:59:05,450 --> 02:59:06,410
I don't even know.

5181
02:59:06,550 --> 02:59:07,250
I guess we are.

5182
02:59:08,950 --> 02:59:09,350
Yeah.

5183
02:59:09,450 --> 02:59:09,670
Huh?

5184
02:59:09,730 --> 02:59:10,410
I guess we are.

5185
02:59:10,450 --> 02:59:12,250
We're playing... So there's two more games.

5186
02:59:12,350 --> 02:59:13,530
This game and the game after.

5187
02:59:14,190 --> 02:59:14,590
Yeah.

5188
02:59:15,950 --> 02:59:17,810
We got this, I believe.

5189
02:59:17,910 --> 02:59:22,190
We just need one really good game and then we can fucking fuck her off.

5190
02:59:22,930 --> 02:59:23,430
It's calm.

5191
02:59:23,710 --> 02:59:24,250
It's calm.

5192
02:59:24,330 --> 02:59:24,750
It's calm.

5193
02:59:24,810 --> 02:59:25,090
It's calm.

5194
02:59:26,090 --> 02:59:26,630
It's calm.

5195
02:59:26,870 --> 02:59:27,630
It's just $100.

5196
02:59:29,890 --> 02:59:30,610
It's a lot.

5197
02:59:30,710 --> 02:59:31,930
A lot of money we're playing for here.

5198
02:59:32,110 --> 02:59:33,290
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

5199
02:59:33,470 --> 02:59:34,210
We got this.

5200
02:59:34,950 --> 02:59:35,390
Fuck.

5201
02:59:36,830 --> 02:59:37,650
No pressure.

5202
02:59:38,490 --> 02:59:39,150
No pressure.

5203
02:59:39,450 --> 02:59:39,950
No pressure.

5204
02:59:40,010 --> 02:59:44,890
You guys already used up all the money you guys won from Esports Champion?

5205
02:59:45,230 --> 02:59:45,790
Like, what happened?

5206
02:59:47,210 --> 02:59:49,210
Bro, we don't even have the money yet.

5207
02:59:49,230 --> 02:59:50,630
You guys don't have the money yet?

5208
02:59:50,910 --> 02:59:51,350
What?

5209
02:59:53,770 --> 02:59:54,210
No.

5210
02:59:54,550 --> 02:59:56,250
How long does it take to be sent?

5211
02:59:57,070 --> 02:59:57,810
I don't know.

5212
02:59:58,070 --> 02:59:58,510
Why?

5213
02:59:58,910 --> 02:59:59,690
Oh, shit.

5214
03:00:01,170 --> 03:00:01,990
Okay, guys.

5215
03:00:02,370 --> 03:00:03,730
Guys, this is why they need this.

5216
03:00:03,830 --> 03:00:04,130
Okay.

5217
03:00:04,890 --> 03:00:06,070
Yeah, I don't have any money.

5218
03:00:06,150 --> 03:00:09,310
Like, I don't have any money in my bank account at this current.

5219
03:00:09,730 --> 03:00:10,090
Like...

5220
03:00:10,090 --> 03:00:10,650
Wait, actually?

5221
03:00:11,490 --> 03:00:13,730
I generally have 30 euros in my account right now.

5222
03:00:13,830 --> 03:00:14,090
What?

5223
03:00:14,610 --> 03:00:14,970
Guys.

5224
03:00:15,330 --> 03:00:15,970
Guys, okay.

5225
03:00:16,030 --> 03:00:17,830
This is their Twitch, guys.

5226
03:00:18,330 --> 03:00:19,590
Shout out to my teammates.

5227
03:00:20,170 --> 03:00:21,170
This is their Twitch.

5228
03:00:23,230 --> 03:00:23,930
This is...

5229
03:00:23,930 --> 03:00:25,210
Yo, let the money float in.

5230
03:00:25,210 --> 03:00:28,950
Yo, let the money float in.

5231
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:30,710
Guys, this is their Twitch, guys.

5232
03:00:30,710 --> 03:00:32,550
AlphaTru is looking bad out here too, bro.

5233
03:00:32,930 --> 03:00:33,910
Too much charity.

5234
03:00:34,010 --> 03:00:35,110
That shit getting abused.

5235
03:00:39,530 --> 03:00:40,570
Oh my god.

5236
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:43,110
This is why, this is why they need a...

5237
03:00:43,110 --> 03:00:44,230
We need a win, guys.

5238
03:00:44,470 --> 03:00:45,710
This is why we need a win.

5239
03:00:46,550 --> 03:00:48,130
I need that money to win.

5240
03:00:48,390 --> 03:00:50,670
He needs that money for the bank account.

5241
03:00:50,670 --> 03:00:50,950
Yeah.

5242
03:00:52,890 --> 03:00:53,930
Oh my god.

5243
03:00:54,170 --> 03:00:55,110
Are you guys okay?

5244
03:00:56,950 --> 03:00:57,610
I'm not.

5245
03:00:58,730 --> 03:01:00,130
Okay, I know you're not okay.

5246
03:01:00,270 --> 03:01:01,150
But what about you, Effect?

5247
03:01:01,330 --> 03:01:03,250
Like, I know there's a lot of stuff going on there.

5248
03:01:03,430 --> 03:01:05,810
But like, what about you, Effect?

5249
03:01:07,110 --> 03:01:08,230
Are you okay?

5250
03:01:09,010 --> 03:01:09,630
I'm okay.

5251
03:01:10,250 --> 03:01:11,650
You don't seem... Are you?

5252
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:12,490
Are you the...

5253
03:01:12,490 --> 03:01:14,230
Are you actually the... Are you okay?

5254
03:01:14,790 --> 03:01:18,530
No, I'm okay.

5255
03:01:18,910 --> 03:01:19,870
Thank you for that ASMR.

5256
03:01:20,670 --> 03:01:21,050
I feel better.

5257
03:01:24,850 --> 03:01:25,670
Oh my god.

5258
03:01:26,250 --> 03:01:27,270
Oh my god.

5259
03:01:28,630 --> 03:01:29,850
Bro, this is your teammate.

5260
03:01:32,310 --> 03:01:33,110
I know.

5261
03:01:33,530 --> 03:01:34,670
I have to deal with it.

5262
03:01:36,710 --> 03:01:37,110
Yo.

5263
03:01:39,490 --> 03:01:41,490
Damn, he's giving that to you for free.

5264
03:01:41,690 --> 03:01:43,570
People need a tier 3 sub for that.

5265
03:01:43,910 --> 03:01:43,930
Yeah, bro.

5266
03:01:43,930 --> 03:01:44,190
Come on.

5267
03:01:44,230 --> 03:01:45,190
People pay for that, dude.

5268
03:01:45,390 --> 03:01:46,410
I'm just giving that shit from here.

5269
03:01:50,050 --> 03:01:50,450
ASMR.

5270
03:01:50,670 --> 03:01:51,010
ASMR sickness.

5271
03:01:55,150 --> 03:01:57,530
Bro, I'm trying to be that deep e-boy.

5272
03:01:58,270 --> 03:01:58,990
Deep e-boy?

5273
03:01:59,170 --> 03:01:59,370
Deep e-boy.

5274
03:01:59,970 --> 03:02:00,710
Alright, wait, wait.

5275
03:02:02,130 --> 03:02:03,190
I can't even.

5276
03:02:05,710 --> 03:02:06,970
Yo, what's up?

5277
03:02:07,310 --> 03:02:08,030
What's up, man?

5278
03:02:12,610 --> 03:02:13,710
Wait, come on.

5279
03:02:13,710 --> 03:02:14,130
Keep going.

5280
03:02:14,530 --> 03:02:15,290
Are we locked or what?

5281
03:02:16,770 --> 03:02:17,510
Bro, nah.

5282
03:02:18,990 --> 03:02:23,450
We're locked in shoddy.

5283
03:02:28,170 --> 03:02:29,310
Alright, we'll be playing now.

5284
03:02:29,410 --> 03:02:29,930
What am I playing?

5285
03:02:30,090 --> 03:02:30,250
Rift?

5286
03:02:30,370 --> 03:02:31,490
I'm playing Bangalore, right?

5287
03:02:32,710 --> 03:02:34,190
Bro, I think Rift is the key.

5288
03:02:34,290 --> 03:02:34,950
I'm not kidding, bro.

5289
03:02:35,430 --> 03:02:35,830
Alright.

5290
03:02:35,890 --> 03:02:36,310
It might be.

5291
03:02:37,110 --> 03:02:38,170
You ready or what?

5292
03:02:38,490 --> 03:02:38,890
Yep.

5293
03:02:39,030 --> 03:02:39,430
Alright.

5294
03:02:39,610 --> 03:02:40,490
I'm the worst racer.

5295
03:02:41,070 --> 03:02:41,990
Wait, what?

5296
03:02:43,410 --> 03:02:45,230
You don't say that after.

5297
03:02:50,090 --> 03:02:58,230
Okay, this is gonna be really... we either get knocked out first or we actually gonna make it.

5298
03:02:58,350 --> 03:02:59,190
We're gonna win it all.

5299
03:02:59,450 --> 03:03:00,030
We're gonna win it all, dude.

5300
03:03:00,450 --> 03:03:01,570
Yeah, we're dropping a 50 bomb right now.

5301
03:03:03,950 --> 03:03:04,330
Let's go.

5302
03:03:04,650 --> 03:03:06,150
Right here, we get that 50 bomb.

5303
03:03:07,030 --> 03:03:07,870
Just give me the toilet.

5304
03:03:08,230 --> 03:03:09,370
Doki with 20 kills, is he?

5305
03:03:09,470 --> 03:03:11,730
Alright, we push Ekko now, right?

5306
03:03:12,090 --> 03:03:12,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5307
03:03:13,390 --> 03:03:13,870
You ready?

5308
03:03:13,990 --> 03:03:14,310
Loot up!

5309
03:03:14,410 --> 03:03:15,190
Yo, we stop Loot Puffs.

5310
03:03:15,310 --> 03:03:16,090
We stop Loot Puffs, I'm like...

5311
03:03:16,090 --> 03:03:18,050
Yeah, Efek got super hyped up after that.

5312
03:03:18,090 --> 03:03:18,970
I have no Logra, I loot nothing.

5313
03:03:20,290 --> 03:03:20,770
Oh, what?

5314
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:21,130
Yes!

5315
03:03:21,770 --> 03:03:22,550
Yeah, seven games!

5316
03:03:22,610 --> 03:03:23,930
Yeah, we need that seventh game!

5317
03:03:23,950 --> 03:03:24,610
We need that?

5318
03:03:24,630 --> 03:03:25,550
Do you see we need that bro?

5319
03:03:25,690 --> 03:03:27,090
Oh, we don't, we gotta win now or we serve?

5320
03:03:28,890 --> 03:03:31,030
We need that seventh game though.

5321
03:03:31,190 --> 03:03:32,130
No, we don't, we don't.

5322
03:03:32,130 --> 03:03:32,910
What do you mean?

5323
03:03:34,690 --> 03:03:36,670
We're like fourth place, what do you mean?

5324
03:03:38,290 --> 03:03:40,930
It's fine, we win now with like 700 million points.

5325
03:03:41,070 --> 03:03:42,710
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

5326
03:03:42,930 --> 03:03:44,550
That's how math works, by the way.

5327
03:03:45,430 --> 03:03:46,430
That's how math works.

5328
03:03:46,950 --> 03:03:48,030
That's how I get told in school.

5329
03:03:48,750 --> 03:03:50,370
You're saying the teachers lied to me?

5330
03:03:50,870 --> 03:03:52,430
Yes, Austrian teachers, maybe.

5331
03:03:53,110 --> 03:03:54,090
Ah, bro, I'm fucking ups.

5332
03:03:59,280 --> 03:04:03,100
Bro, you're barely even alive, I don't think you can do math right now.

5333
03:04:03,120 --> 03:04:04,500
Bro, actually, that's how you sound like.

5334
03:04:05,380 --> 03:04:07,140
What the fuck do you mean?

5335
03:04:07,360 --> 03:04:10,000
You sound like a fucking guy, like...

5336
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:10,820
No way!

5337
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:15,960
I can hear, I can hear your cough drops right now.

5338
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:18,380
It's like fucking...

5339
03:04:18,380 --> 03:04:19,080
Why do we have zone?

5340
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:20,260
Bro!

5341
03:04:22,360 --> 03:04:23,500
What do you mean?

5342
03:04:24,440 --> 03:04:26,360
Oh, bro, this is crazy.

5343
03:04:27,380 --> 03:04:29,120
Anyways, can we... in fact, we have zone.

5344
03:04:29,560 --> 03:04:29,940
Okay.

5345
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:31,140
And?

5346
03:04:31,540 --> 03:04:33,140
And what do you want us to do with that?

5347
03:04:33,560 --> 03:04:34,400
I don't know, bro.

5348
03:04:35,260 --> 03:04:36,700
What do you want us to do with that information?

5349
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:37,280
Okay.

5350
03:04:37,800 --> 03:04:38,800
I don't know, bro, whip it up.

5351
03:04:38,900 --> 03:04:39,100
I don't know.

5352
03:04:40,820 --> 03:04:42,680
All right, I'm heading... I'm ready heading over.

5353
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:44,280
Ready heading over?

5354
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:45,320
Sounds...

5355
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:47,200
I need, like, a long range.

5356
03:04:47,300 --> 03:04:48,360
I have alternator eva ready.

5357
03:04:48,360 --> 03:04:48,800
What if I hit Kennen?

5358
03:04:49,640 --> 03:04:49,960
Bro...

5359
03:04:49,960 --> 03:04:50,640
He might be behind them.

5360
03:04:51,680 --> 03:04:52,000
Bro...

5361
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:53,520
Elas, Elas, Elas, Elas.

5362
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:54,620
Do it, do it.

5363
03:04:54,620 --> 03:04:55,400
I think it works.

5364
03:04:56,380 --> 03:04:56,700
Bro...

5365
03:04:57,220 --> 03:04:57,540
Okay.

5366
03:05:01,320 --> 03:05:03,240
Because if they're there, I just couldn't come back, you know what I'm saying?

5367
03:05:03,420 --> 03:05:04,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5368
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:05,140
I don't see them at all.

5369
03:05:05,160 --> 03:05:05,380
You see them?

5370
03:05:05,780 --> 03:05:06,080
No.

5371
03:05:06,860 --> 03:05:07,960
I'm gonna go to...

5372
03:05:07,960 --> 03:05:08,780
Oh, I see this Kennen, this Kennen.

5373
03:05:08,860 --> 03:05:09,280
They know.

5374
03:05:09,280 --> 03:05:09,740
Fuck.

5375
03:05:09,860 --> 03:05:10,600
They know now.

5376
03:05:10,660 --> 03:05:11,800
They know you're at the Kennen.

5377
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:12,520
Hit that shit, hit that shit, hit that shit.

5378
03:05:12,620 --> 03:05:13,220
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

5379
03:05:13,320 --> 03:05:13,580
All right, all right, all right.

5380
03:05:13,580 --> 03:05:13,960
I'm already there.

5381
03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:14,320
I'm already there.

5382
03:05:14,660 --> 03:05:14,940
I'm...

5383
03:05:14,940 --> 03:05:16,380
Well, I'm not there, but okay.

5384
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:18,420
On the roof?

5385
03:05:18,660 --> 03:05:19,520
You can fuck this guy on the roof.

5386
03:05:20,360 --> 03:05:20,640
Yeah.

5387
03:05:20,760 --> 03:05:21,720
Okay, I'm heading over.

5388
03:05:21,740 --> 03:05:22,020
You guys...

5389
03:05:22,020 --> 03:05:22,200
Yeah.

5390
03:05:23,660 --> 03:05:24,360
Fuck this guy on the left of the roof.

5391
03:05:25,320 --> 03:05:27,200
I'm, like, ten seconds behind you guys.

5392
03:05:27,240 --> 03:05:28,040
You guys were so fast.

5393
03:05:28,560 --> 03:05:29,180
I know where he is.

5394
03:05:29,200 --> 03:05:29,420
Where is he?

5395
03:05:29,940 --> 03:05:30,480
He was here.

5396
03:05:30,780 --> 03:05:31,540
Like, somewhere this direction.

5397
03:05:31,940 --> 03:05:32,220
Okay.

5398
03:05:32,220 --> 03:05:33,020
We're inside the ring.

5399
03:05:33,480 --> 03:05:34,580
Got the position on base.

5400
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:35,500
That one...

5401
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:35,940
That one...

5402
03:05:35,940 --> 03:05:36,280
Over here?

5403
03:05:36,900 --> 03:05:37,180
Yeah.

5404
03:05:37,260 --> 03:05:38,140
I smoked for myself.

5405
03:05:39,080 --> 03:05:39,800
I'm gonna slide down here.

5406
03:05:40,300 --> 03:05:41,140
I'm heading over to you.

5407
03:05:42,580 --> 03:05:43,240
I don't know where the...

5408
03:05:44,440 --> 03:05:44,820
Oh, there.

5409
03:05:44,960 --> 03:05:45,460
One on the right.

5410
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:47,680
I'm almost...

5411
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:48,580
Flash, flash here.

5412
03:05:48,900 --> 03:05:49,340
Okay, okay.

5413
03:05:49,340 --> 03:05:49,600
I'm healing.

5414
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:50,980
One of me in front of me here.

5415
03:05:51,740 --> 03:05:52,020
Okay.

5416
03:05:52,460 --> 03:05:53,240
I'm healing now.

5417
03:05:53,940 --> 03:05:54,320
He's one.

5418
03:05:54,700 --> 03:05:54,980
Dead.

5419
03:05:55,020 --> 03:05:55,500
Cracked, cracked, cracked.

5420
03:05:55,720 --> 03:05:56,000
90.

5421
03:05:56,140 --> 03:05:56,500
Yeah, I'm pushing him.

5422
03:05:56,740 --> 03:05:57,020
Okay.

5423
03:05:57,120 --> 03:05:57,540
Go for him.

5424
03:05:57,580 --> 03:05:57,860
I cracked him.

5425
03:05:58,940 --> 03:05:59,400
Fuck him up.

5426
03:05:59,420 --> 03:05:59,680
Eat his ass.

5427
03:05:59,720 --> 03:06:00,380
Left one on UAV.

5428
03:06:00,540 --> 03:06:01,120
Munch, munch, munch, munch, munch.

5429
03:06:01,420 --> 03:06:02,240
I'm scrying in circles.

5430
03:06:02,460 --> 03:06:04,020
Five months soon.

5431
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:05,360
Hey.

5432
03:06:05,360 --> 03:06:05,880
Whoa.

5433
03:06:06,400 --> 03:06:06,720
Nice.

5434
03:06:08,800 --> 03:06:10,100
This is not BM, guys.

5435
03:06:11,540 --> 03:06:12,880
Balloon coming in from pylon.

5436
03:06:13,020 --> 03:06:13,220
Watch out.

5437
03:06:13,480 --> 03:06:13,800
Okay.

5438
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:15,360
Where's the last guy?

5439
03:06:15,620 --> 03:06:16,640
Since we potentially have zone here.

5440
03:06:17,800 --> 03:06:18,520
Yeah, balloon flanked us.

5441
03:06:18,820 --> 03:06:19,420
He got broke.

5442
03:06:19,460 --> 03:06:19,760
Yeah.

5443
03:06:20,500 --> 03:06:20,820
Okay.

5444
03:06:21,820 --> 03:06:22,440
He's gonna play here.

5445
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:23,520
Okay.

5446
03:06:23,940 --> 03:06:24,680
What in the sigma?

5447
03:06:25,140 --> 03:06:26,080
I'm just gonna grab stuff.

5448
03:06:32,310 --> 03:06:32,790
Oh, shit.

5449
03:06:32,910 --> 03:06:33,090
Nice.

5450
03:06:33,090 --> 03:06:33,490
I might come here.

5451
03:06:33,550 --> 03:06:33,810
Watch out.

5452
03:06:34,850 --> 03:06:36,270
Yeah, you're getting shot from Munch soon.

5453
03:06:36,350 --> 03:06:36,890
We need to watch out.

5454
03:06:36,950 --> 03:06:36,990
Okay.

5455
03:06:37,010 --> 03:06:37,750
Yeah.

5456
03:06:37,790 --> 03:06:37,890
Yeah.

5457
03:06:37,910 --> 03:06:38,310
Watch out.

5458
03:06:38,370 --> 03:06:39,890
They're the first place team for a reason.

5459
03:06:39,990 --> 03:06:40,270
Yeah.

5460
03:06:40,370 --> 03:06:41,050
What if we turn around?

5461
03:06:41,210 --> 03:06:42,010
Fuck them up.

5462
03:06:42,150 --> 03:06:42,550
No.

5463
03:06:42,630 --> 03:06:43,030
No.

5464
03:06:43,450 --> 03:06:44,950
Ah, shit, bro.

5465
03:06:45,070 --> 03:06:46,130
I got the wrong...

5466
03:06:46,130 --> 03:06:46,310
Let's go.

5467
03:06:46,310 --> 03:06:47,230
I forgot big alert.

5468
03:06:47,250 --> 03:06:47,630
Let's go.

5469
03:06:47,790 --> 03:06:50,990
I got the wrong upgrade.

5470
03:06:51,250 --> 03:06:52,490
I got the wrong...

5471
03:06:52,490 --> 03:06:52,910
Oh, shit.

5472
03:06:52,970 --> 03:06:53,410
It's fine.

5473
03:06:53,530 --> 03:06:53,910
Okay.

5474
03:06:53,970 --> 03:06:54,330
It's fine.

5475
03:06:55,290 --> 03:06:55,930
It's okay.

5476
03:06:56,450 --> 03:06:57,410
Everything is fine.

5477
03:06:57,430 --> 03:06:57,890
They might come though.

5478
03:06:59,770 --> 03:07:00,250
It's okay.

5479
03:07:00,310 --> 03:07:01,450
I get all fast now.

5480
03:07:01,530 --> 03:07:01,830
Yeah.

5481
03:07:02,950 --> 03:07:03,790
So far though.

5482
03:07:04,550 --> 03:07:04,950
Yep.

5483
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:05,310
They're not real.

5484
03:07:07,130 --> 03:07:08,970
Did we kill the full team or...

5485
03:07:08,970 --> 03:07:09,550
At least two.

5486
03:07:09,790 --> 03:07:10,650
Did we kill all three?

5487
03:07:11,130 --> 03:07:11,410
Two.

5488
03:07:11,870 --> 03:07:12,150
Okay.

5489
03:07:12,190 --> 03:07:12,410
Two.

5490
03:07:12,470 --> 03:07:12,690
Okay.

5491
03:07:12,990 --> 03:07:13,270
Cannon.

5492
03:07:13,370 --> 03:07:13,890
They're going to take a movie.

5493
03:07:14,110 --> 03:07:14,390
Fuck.

5494
03:07:15,150 --> 03:07:15,770
Two guys on cannon.

5495
03:07:15,770 --> 03:07:16,470
One's cracked.

5496
03:07:17,570 --> 03:07:18,030
Skippy died.

5497
03:07:20,310 --> 03:07:20,790
Trying to nade it?

5498
03:07:20,830 --> 03:07:21,350
We're not putting on a bang.

5499
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:22,570
Okay.

5500
03:07:22,630 --> 03:07:23,390
But she's like with him.

5501
03:07:23,690 --> 03:07:23,850
Yeah.

5502
03:07:23,850 --> 03:07:24,170
She's far left.

5503
03:07:24,230 --> 03:07:24,330
Yeah.

5504
03:07:24,770 --> 03:07:25,450
What a nade, bro.

5505
03:07:25,510 --> 03:07:25,870
I'm so ass.

5506
03:07:26,330 --> 03:07:27,430
I'm trying to get across.

5507
03:07:27,910 --> 03:07:28,010
Okay.

5508
03:07:29,190 --> 03:07:29,750
Marking on them effect.

5509
03:07:30,650 --> 03:07:31,370
They're all together now.

5510
03:07:31,370 --> 03:07:31,630
Big dead.

5511
03:07:31,750 --> 03:07:31,850
Big dead.

5512
03:07:32,490 --> 03:07:33,210
So much damage.

5513
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:37,510
One down.

5514
03:07:37,830 --> 03:07:37,890
One down.

5515
03:07:37,950 --> 03:07:38,230
One down.

5516
03:07:38,350 --> 03:07:38,470
One down.

5517
03:07:38,570 --> 03:07:39,030
One down.

5518
03:07:39,090 --> 03:07:39,630
Ah fuck.

5519
03:07:39,730 --> 03:07:40,130
That's all you got.

5520
03:07:40,470 --> 03:07:40,750
Yeah.

5521
03:07:40,770 --> 03:07:41,190
You're by yourself.

5522
03:07:41,270 --> 03:07:41,730
You're by yourself.

5523
03:07:41,830 --> 03:07:42,750
There's three on that cannon.

5524
03:07:44,930 --> 03:07:45,390
Whoa effect.

5525
03:07:45,410 --> 03:07:45,710
I got a ten.

5526
03:07:47,390 --> 03:07:48,330
Oh my God.

5527
03:07:48,870 --> 03:07:49,310
One HP.

5528
03:07:49,390 --> 03:07:49,870
I got a look.

5529
03:07:50,390 --> 03:07:52,590
I'm running over.

5530
03:07:52,770 --> 03:07:53,010
Let's run.

5531
03:07:53,010 --> 03:07:53,210
Let's run.

5532
03:07:53,270 --> 03:07:53,390
One HP.

5533
03:07:53,470 --> 03:07:53,630
Let's run.

5534
03:07:53,670 --> 03:07:53,850
One HP.

5535
03:07:54,090 --> 03:07:54,370
Okay.

5536
03:07:54,390 --> 03:07:54,530
Okay.

5537
03:07:55,230 --> 03:07:56,290
No, he's mine!

5538
03:08:02,810 --> 03:08:05,230
Okay, Skippity and LanderRotate are dead!

5539
03:08:05,510 --> 03:08:07,330
They're dead, so...

5540
03:08:07,330 --> 03:08:08,470
No, we're off, baby, we're off!

5541
03:08:08,690 --> 03:08:09,850
Let's go, that's our game!

5542
03:08:10,750 --> 03:08:11,370
Yes, sir!

5543
03:08:12,910 --> 03:08:15,230
Bro, I swear, I haven't shot my gun.

5544
03:08:15,450 --> 03:08:18,390
I shot my gun one time, and that was from that air thing.

5545
03:08:18,590 --> 03:08:20,350
You guys are so fucking fast.

5546
03:08:23,670 --> 03:08:25,850
You're so fast, I can't keep up!

5547
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:26,290
You're so fast, I can't keep up!

5548
03:08:27,230 --> 03:08:28,110
Watch our back as well.

5549
03:08:29,010 --> 03:08:29,330
Okay.

5550
03:08:30,770 --> 03:08:31,570
I'm going to leave Rotate to us.

5551
03:08:32,470 --> 03:08:33,770
I'm going to leave Rotate to us.

5552
03:08:36,050 --> 03:08:37,830
Dragon's team has been playing zone this entire time.

5553
03:08:38,150 --> 03:08:38,270
Dragon's team has been playing zone this entire time.

5554
03:08:41,030 --> 03:08:42,570
Wait, the Bangalore is here in front of us.

5555
03:08:42,990 --> 03:08:43,890
Let's go over there.

5556
03:08:44,670 --> 03:08:46,770
I got zipped on, bro, literally in my face too, guys.

5557
03:08:47,070 --> 03:08:48,650
Yo, yo, we're heading over, I'm heading over.

5558
03:08:48,910 --> 03:08:49,350
Cracked one.

5559
03:08:49,730 --> 03:08:50,730
Half, half, half, half.

5560
03:08:50,930 --> 03:08:51,670
One is B.

5561
03:08:53,470 --> 03:08:54,970
I'm trying to...

5562
03:08:55,410 --> 03:08:57,170
What the fuck, I got stuck on that tree.

5563
03:08:58,430 --> 03:08:59,390
I'm heading over to you.

5564
03:08:59,990 --> 03:09:00,670
Here in front of me.

5565
03:09:01,770 --> 03:09:03,090
Two behind this rock, one on the left.

5566
03:09:03,390 --> 03:09:04,190
Careful, team behind this rock.

5567
03:09:09,470 --> 03:09:09,870
Cracked her!

5568
03:09:09,970 --> 03:09:10,150
Cracked her!

5569
03:09:10,210 --> 03:09:10,490
Cracked her!

5570
03:09:10,650 --> 03:09:10,970
Nice.

5571
03:09:12,590 --> 03:09:13,570
I'm graffling the guy on the right.

5572
03:09:14,990 --> 03:09:17,810
I cracked the... I think that was the catalyst that got knocked.

5573
03:09:18,050 --> 03:09:18,310
Yeah.

5574
03:09:20,230 --> 03:09:20,990
I heard a grapple.

5575
03:09:21,150 --> 03:09:21,350
Cracked him, cracked him.

5576
03:09:21,590 --> 03:09:23,470
Left, on your left.

5577
03:09:24,250 --> 03:09:24,750
I'm dead.

5578
03:09:25,810 --> 03:09:26,370
Cracked the two.

5579
03:09:28,270 --> 03:09:29,430
I'm thirsting the catalyst.

5580
03:09:29,610 --> 03:09:30,430
I don't know if I can...

5581
03:09:31,310 --> 03:09:32,090
I'm smoking that.

5582
03:09:32,710 --> 03:09:33,830
Can I even get you?

5583
03:09:34,710 --> 03:09:35,250
Maybe here.

5584
03:09:35,350 --> 03:09:39,050
No, I died.

5585
03:09:39,690 --> 03:09:40,670
Play your life, play your life.

5586
03:09:42,610 --> 03:09:43,670
Don't care about us.

5587
03:09:44,430 --> 03:09:46,390
Okay, we might got a little too overzealous.

5588
03:09:47,830 --> 03:09:48,730
I threw, man.

5589
03:09:48,850 --> 03:09:49,170
I threw.

5590
03:09:49,290 --> 03:09:49,950
I did so bad.

5591
03:09:50,470 --> 03:09:51,710
Yo, am I even crawling away?

5592
03:09:53,170 --> 03:09:55,970
I believe in unlucky to be the best rat.

5593
03:09:56,010 --> 03:09:57,910
You just have to rat so hard that you win.

5594
03:09:59,110 --> 03:10:00,670
Nah, I'm getting frustrated by two teams now.

5595
03:10:00,670 --> 03:10:01,010
Just rat.

5596
03:10:02,190 --> 03:10:02,550
Survive.

5597
03:10:02,550 --> 03:10:03,450
I don't want to rat.

5598
03:10:03,550 --> 03:10:03,810
I don't want to rat.

5599
03:10:03,810 --> 03:10:04,030
No!

5600
03:10:04,030 --> 03:10:04,950
We need these points!

5601
03:10:05,070 --> 03:10:05,990
We killed Skippity!

5602
03:10:06,750 --> 03:10:07,510
How many points?

5603
03:10:07,630 --> 03:10:08,150
How many do we need?

5604
03:10:08,310 --> 03:10:10,730
We need, like, second place or third place.

5605
03:10:11,730 --> 03:10:12,510
Yeah, but how many points?

5606
03:10:12,650 --> 03:10:13,470
How far are we?

5607
03:10:13,610 --> 03:10:15,090
We need... Okay, I'll look, I'll look.

5608
03:10:15,090 --> 03:10:17,090
We need... We need 20 points.

5609
03:10:18,190 --> 03:10:18,510
Easy.

5610
03:10:19,030 --> 03:10:19,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5611
03:10:20,090 --> 03:10:20,770
Just rat.

5612
03:10:22,670 --> 03:10:23,950
You can get my banner for sure, bro.

5613
03:10:24,030 --> 03:10:24,810
I have Moby, bro.

5614
03:10:25,250 --> 03:10:26,730
Yeah, but be safe, though.

5615
03:10:26,730 --> 03:10:27,850
TP, I could, but I have no TP.

5616
03:10:28,450 --> 03:10:29,450
He is close to you.

5617
03:10:29,530 --> 03:10:30,170
You can even Q away.

5618
03:10:30,270 --> 03:10:32,890
In fact, I swear to God, if he fucking...

5619
03:10:33,210 --> 03:10:34,690
Oh wait, get in zone, maybe.

5620
03:10:34,970 --> 03:10:35,510
I only got one med kit.

5621
03:10:36,830 --> 03:10:38,050
Do you have meds on you, Effect?

5622
03:10:39,010 --> 03:10:39,570
I do.

5623
03:10:40,410 --> 03:10:41,830
Oh, there's people, there's people, there's people there.

5624
03:10:42,150 --> 03:10:42,770
Yeah, the rest.

5625
03:10:45,190 --> 03:10:46,030
Go for it, go for it.

5626
03:10:48,890 --> 03:10:49,490
Yes, sir.

5627
03:10:49,850 --> 03:10:50,310
They're fighting.

5628
03:10:51,330 --> 03:10:51,890
They're going Echo.

5629
03:10:54,850 --> 03:10:55,770
They're rezzing, just leave.

5630
03:10:56,690 --> 03:10:57,930
Just don't play cocky there.

5631
03:10:59,250 --> 03:11:00,950
There might be a team up top, so careful.

5632
03:11:01,810 --> 03:11:02,130
Yeah.

5633
03:11:03,430 --> 03:11:05,310
I think you might as well just rezz here instead.

5634
03:11:06,370 --> 03:11:07,110
I have Moby as well.

5635
03:11:07,850 --> 03:11:08,590
What if I just rezz here?

5636
03:11:08,810 --> 03:11:09,890
Yeah, yeah, just saying, rezz here.

5637
03:11:10,310 --> 03:11:11,670
But, like, not in front of everybody.

5638
03:11:12,690 --> 03:11:13,470
No, there's balloon left.

5639
03:11:13,630 --> 03:11:14,470
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5640
03:11:16,650 --> 03:11:17,530
I have TP soon.

5641
03:11:17,550 --> 03:11:18,050
Use your mobile.

5642
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:22,440
Use your Moby.

5643
03:11:24,700 --> 03:11:26,040
Yeah, I think go, I guess I'm open now.

5644
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:26,880
Go back, go back, go back.

5645
03:11:27,840 --> 03:11:29,920
What about that team to the left?

5646
03:11:30,300 --> 03:11:31,160
Oh, zip on you.

5647
03:11:31,500 --> 03:11:31,980
I know.

5648
03:11:33,540 --> 03:11:35,160
I have TP, I'm 82.

5649
03:11:35,700 --> 03:11:37,360
Okay, I'm gonna, I'm scared.

5650
03:11:37,980 --> 03:11:39,340
I'm scared, I'm looking away.

5651
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:41,820
I have TP soon.

5652
03:11:46,900 --> 03:11:47,220
Fuck.

5653
03:11:47,220 --> 03:11:48,180
They broke the balloon.

5654
03:11:48,260 --> 03:11:50,960
I think you just chill here in zone, you know?

5655
03:11:51,020 --> 03:11:51,400
And then rezz.

5656
03:11:56,450 --> 03:11:57,250
I'm going Barra.

5657
03:11:58,850 --> 03:11:59,250
Cool.

5658
03:12:00,830 --> 03:12:01,730
I can't look.

5659
03:12:14,950 --> 03:12:15,750
You call him, maybe?

5660
03:12:16,030 --> 03:12:17,190
Yeah, call Moby here.

5661
03:12:18,430 --> 03:12:19,650
Just call Moby, yeah.

5662
03:12:24,070 --> 03:12:26,030
And then we can go loot Coastal, easy.

5663
03:12:26,270 --> 03:12:26,670
Yeah.

5664
03:12:26,670 --> 03:12:26,770
Yeah.

5665
03:12:29,230 --> 03:12:30,670
I don't need my medkit, by the way.

5666
03:12:30,710 --> 03:12:31,890
I think we should go Pilot, to be honest.

5667
03:12:32,050 --> 03:12:32,750
You see Box in front of you.

5668
03:12:33,910 --> 03:12:34,350
Yeah, I know.

5669
03:12:35,710 --> 03:12:38,010
We can kill the spiders, too, if we're...

5670
03:12:39,330 --> 03:12:39,570
meds.

5671
03:12:40,870 --> 03:12:41,610
But we might get held.

5672
03:12:42,750 --> 03:12:43,910
Yeah, I know, that's why I don't wanna...

5673
03:12:44,530 --> 03:12:45,330
We can't do spiders.

5674
03:12:46,830 --> 03:12:47,910
I think I want medkit, that's why.

5675
03:12:48,050 --> 03:12:48,410
I don't wanna see them.

5676
03:12:49,170 --> 03:12:50,690
They're shooting here, but I don't know what's going on.

5677
03:12:50,690 --> 03:12:51,250
It's fine, it's fine.

5678
03:12:51,770 --> 03:12:52,410
We're good, we're good.

5679
03:12:52,610 --> 03:12:53,050
Nobody's there.

5680
03:12:53,150 --> 03:12:53,510
Nobody's there.

5681
03:12:54,810 --> 03:12:56,630
On the hill, on the chill, only one guy.

5682
03:12:57,190 --> 03:12:58,730
By the way, you can take it.

5683
03:12:59,330 --> 03:12:59,970
160 bullets.

5684
03:13:02,270 --> 03:13:03,490
Only saw one guy over there.

5685
03:13:07,340 --> 03:13:07,660
Oh!

5686
03:13:08,440 --> 03:13:09,480
You can loot that box.

5687
03:13:09,640 --> 03:13:10,820
I'm gonna go to Unlucky.

5688
03:13:13,120 --> 03:13:14,180
Taking a different path.

5689
03:13:14,360 --> 03:13:15,520
Yeah, it's a full team in Pilot, I think.

5690
03:13:15,580 --> 03:13:16,380
Maybe we can fight them, even.

5691
03:13:17,100 --> 03:13:17,600
Come, come.

5692
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:18,360
I'm good to fight.

5693
03:13:18,480 --> 03:13:20,480
They're sitting in the corner, I don't think they know about this.

5694
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:22,080
Yeah, come, I'll give you meds.

5695
03:13:23,220 --> 03:13:23,700
Yeah, I know.

5696
03:13:25,220 --> 03:13:27,540
I'll take the shield cells, you can take the bats.

5697
03:13:28,660 --> 03:13:29,280
You can take the rest, you can take all this.

5698
03:13:29,580 --> 03:13:30,400
They're literally in front of us.

5699
03:13:30,460 --> 03:13:31,560
On my ping, they're just sitting there.

5700
03:13:31,700 --> 03:13:32,300
They're bang ulting?

5701
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:33,220
I don't know what the fuck they're bang ulting.

5702
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:34,700
They're slid down now.

5703
03:13:36,660 --> 03:13:37,800
Oh, charging, yeah, we're charging.

5704
03:13:38,360 --> 03:13:38,980
Yeah, let's kill this team.

5705
03:13:39,540 --> 03:13:40,200
Yeah, sit down, come.

5706
03:13:46,520 --> 03:13:46,940
Staying up here?

5707
03:13:48,420 --> 03:13:48,800
I'm here.

5708
03:13:50,080 --> 03:13:51,580
I think they went mid.

5709
03:13:52,520 --> 03:13:53,140
There's someone here, I think.

5710
03:13:53,700 --> 03:13:54,380
Inside, inside, inside.

5711
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:55,800
On my door, all three.

5712
03:13:57,680 --> 03:13:58,300
They're gonna put a wall.

5713
03:13:59,180 --> 03:13:59,940
Yeah, they put a wall.

5714
03:14:00,500 --> 03:14:01,380
Oh, they fucked, oh yeah.

5715
03:14:01,640 --> 03:14:02,120
Yeah, I know.

5716
03:14:03,480 --> 03:14:06,660
I cracked, I cracked, Newcastle.

5717
03:14:09,500 --> 03:14:09,940
Newcastle's up.

5718
03:14:10,980 --> 03:14:11,640
I'm chilling, fighting.

5719
03:14:12,360 --> 03:14:13,300
Thing alert low.

5720
03:14:15,620 --> 03:14:16,360
Just heal, just heal.

5721
03:14:18,460 --> 03:14:18,840
I'm healing.

5722
03:14:19,120 --> 03:14:19,820
I have to heal too.

5723
03:14:21,320 --> 03:14:23,240
Yeah, there's a team behind us.

5724
03:14:23,980 --> 03:14:25,020
I'm backing out, backing out.

5725
03:14:25,260 --> 03:14:26,000
I'm backing out a little bit, yeah.

5726
03:14:27,200 --> 03:14:28,100
Nice job, they're resing.

5727
03:14:28,820 --> 03:14:29,540
Gonna go back in.

5728
03:14:30,460 --> 03:14:32,200
This other team behind us might push us though.

5729
03:14:32,460 --> 03:14:34,100
I got the fin, I got the fin, I got the fin.

5730
03:14:34,240 --> 03:14:34,940
Yeah, I'm picking, I'm picking.

5731
03:14:35,440 --> 03:14:36,100
I'm looking behind.

5732
03:14:37,740 --> 03:14:39,880
Careful, careful, careful.

5733
03:14:40,940 --> 03:14:41,900
Don't get knocked, don't get knocked, don't get knocked.

5734
03:14:43,260 --> 03:14:44,100
I got him, I got him, I got him.

5735
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:44,840
All dead, all dead, all dead.

5736
03:14:45,620 --> 03:14:46,360
Watch tree, watch tree.

5737
03:14:46,740 --> 03:14:47,320
Behind us, behind us.

5738
03:14:48,440 --> 03:14:50,600
I'm full HP, we can go in here if we need to.

5739
03:14:51,100 --> 03:14:51,460
Yeah, it's fine.

5740
03:14:53,320 --> 03:14:54,900
Alright, we full heal, I think we're just gonna fight tree.

5741
03:14:54,900 --> 03:14:56,580
We're next, and then we just move over, no?

5742
03:14:57,400 --> 03:14:58,780
I have... do you guys need bats?

5743
03:14:58,900 --> 03:14:59,380
I have bats.

5744
03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:01,220
I have bats too.

5745
03:15:01,960 --> 03:15:03,020
Ah, fuck man, I'm moving.

5746
03:15:05,560 --> 03:15:08,280
I think there's so many teammates in pylon to do that, to be honest, fuck me.

5747
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:09,560
There's an ult XL.

5748
03:15:10,320 --> 03:15:11,680
I got an ult XL for us.

5749
03:15:17,260 --> 03:15:18,120
Let's reach the MSS quick.

5750
03:15:18,880 --> 03:15:20,540
Yeah, I think we have to fight either tree.

5751
03:15:22,060 --> 03:15:23,940
I think it's gonna be hard, because there's so many...

5752
03:15:23,940 --> 03:15:24,880
This team is a lot too...

5753
03:15:25,280 --> 03:15:26,900
We can play water for now, we know we're chilling.

5754
03:15:27,420 --> 03:15:28,060
We don't have to rush.

5755
03:15:28,800 --> 03:15:29,500
Wait, nobody hide?

5756
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:31,160
We can go hide, we can go hide.

5757
03:15:31,820 --> 03:15:32,980
We have to force the fight though.

5758
03:15:33,380 --> 03:15:34,260
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

5759
03:15:36,400 --> 03:15:38,280
No, 75, I can ult XL right now.

5760
03:15:38,320 --> 03:15:38,780
I'm ult XL-ing.

5761
03:15:39,880 --> 03:15:41,000
I can get it right now.

5762
03:15:42,040 --> 03:15:42,940
Yeah, but they will be in front of us.

5763
03:15:43,340 --> 03:15:44,860
Maybe we can TP past them?

5764
03:15:45,040 --> 03:15:46,360
I have it, I have it.

5765
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:47,660
I'm with you.

5766
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:52,840
You need to smoke, you need to smoke here.

5767
03:15:53,880 --> 03:15:54,500
I almost cracked one.

5768
03:15:56,100 --> 03:15:56,860
Oh shit, okay.

5769
03:15:58,820 --> 03:15:59,940
Maybe rest, maybe rest right now.

5770
03:15:59,940 --> 03:16:00,120
Okay.

5771
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:02,520
I'm smoking, I'm double smoking.

5772
03:16:04,660 --> 03:16:05,680
Ours is ours, it's ours.

5773
03:16:06,240 --> 03:16:06,860
Can you rest again?

5774
03:16:07,240 --> 03:16:07,600
Yeah, yeah.

5775
03:16:09,460 --> 03:16:10,620
My smoke might run out here though.

5776
03:16:12,180 --> 03:16:12,800
I hit somebody.

5777
03:16:13,920 --> 03:16:15,420
I think it's not that good, no.

5778
03:16:16,540 --> 03:16:17,260
Oh, it's ambush.

5779
03:16:18,320 --> 03:16:18,600
Yeah.

5780
03:16:19,940 --> 03:16:20,880
Just stay alive, just stay alive.

5781
03:16:20,920 --> 03:16:21,660
Play your life, play your life.

5782
03:16:21,720 --> 03:16:22,600
Because they might push up.

5783
03:16:23,560 --> 03:16:24,280
We'll look, we'll look.

5784
03:16:24,380 --> 03:16:24,760
Here, here.

5785
03:16:26,500 --> 03:16:27,340
Just play it to rest.

5786
03:16:27,380 --> 03:16:27,720
We're gonna fight that, we're good.

5787
03:16:28,540 --> 03:16:29,560
You kill us, you kill us, you kill us.

5788
03:16:30,100 --> 03:16:32,620
I can, I can block it if I have to.

5789
03:16:32,900 --> 03:16:33,180
Sure.

5790
03:16:33,440 --> 03:16:34,400
Yeah, there's a team right above us.

5791
03:16:35,460 --> 03:16:36,760
And there's a team north-east.

5792
03:16:36,840 --> 03:16:37,280
Here, here, careful.

5793
03:16:39,720 --> 03:16:40,440
Can you come here?

5794
03:16:41,060 --> 03:16:41,600
Yeah, I'm trying to.

5795
03:16:41,700 --> 03:16:42,480
I'm bleeding out though.

5796
03:16:42,780 --> 03:16:43,280
Close, close, close.

5797
03:16:43,380 --> 03:16:44,320
No, no, no, don't rest, don't rest.

5798
03:16:44,780 --> 03:16:45,500
I'm dead, I'm dead.

5799
03:16:47,340 --> 03:16:48,860
I'm blocking as much as I can.

5800
03:16:50,840 --> 03:16:51,640
Just get that.

5801
03:16:52,960 --> 03:16:53,480
Oh.

5802
03:16:54,460 --> 03:16:55,960
I'm gonna try my best.

5803
03:16:56,200 --> 03:16:57,960
Oh, I'm body blocking as much as I could.

5804
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:03,320
Oh, nice!

5805
03:17:03,600 --> 03:17:04,760
I swapped it.

5806
03:17:04,840 --> 03:17:05,820
It was pinged.

5807
03:17:05,820 --> 03:17:06,960
I swapped it, man.

5808
03:17:06,980 --> 03:17:07,780
It was fucking pinged.

5809
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:08,620
Nice job.

5810
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:11,800
Bro, my grapple fucked up.

5811
03:17:12,020 --> 03:17:12,440
Yeah.

5812
03:17:14,420 --> 03:17:14,940
Aww.

5813
03:17:16,660 --> 03:17:18,760
Yeah, we got pushed in our backs too.

5814
03:17:18,780 --> 03:17:19,440
So that was unlucky.

5815
03:17:19,980 --> 03:17:20,700
Oh, really?

5816
03:17:20,880 --> 03:17:21,400
Yeah.

5817
03:17:21,640 --> 03:17:22,640
That's why I got knocked.

5818
03:17:22,920 --> 03:17:27,960
Because I was rezzing Effect and then I got pushed in the back so I couldn't finish the rezz.

5819
03:17:28,860 --> 03:17:30,640
Okay, I am voting for...

5820
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:32,560
How did the team...

5821
03:17:32,560 --> 03:17:34,440
Why did the team come to our back?

5822
03:17:34,840 --> 03:17:37,080
Because they had... they saw us.

5823
03:17:37,100 --> 03:17:40,160
I think they saw us rotate so they um...

5824
03:17:41,120 --> 03:17:42,320
They mirrored us.

5825
03:17:43,360 --> 03:17:45,460
We got killed by the backshots?

5826
03:17:45,800 --> 03:17:46,780
Or... no, no.

5827
03:17:47,240 --> 03:17:48,260
Don't say that.

5828
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:53,400
I mean, this was the comp.

5829
03:17:53,640 --> 03:17:56,100
We just got fucked over by our backs.

5830
03:17:56,560 --> 03:17:59,720
It would have been so good if there wasn't everywhere a team, bro.

5831
03:17:59,840 --> 03:18:01,880
The thing is...

5832
03:18:02,960 --> 03:18:03,800
How did...

5833
03:18:03,800 --> 03:18:05,640
Why did the team not end up fighting?

5834
03:18:05,840 --> 03:18:07,340
Like the team who gave you backshots.

5835
03:18:07,580 --> 03:18:08,380
Why did they not fight?

5836
03:18:08,520 --> 03:18:08,960
They did.

5837
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:12,880
They fought the team to the right and then there was a team...

5838
03:18:13,580 --> 03:18:14,480
They knocked us.

5839
03:18:14,480 --> 03:18:14,600
Then there was...

5840
03:18:15,420 --> 03:18:17,660
Then there was a little gap, maybe I could have rezzed.

5841
03:18:18,480 --> 03:18:22,880
I think if you like, insta-take TP after I placed it, and then I stay there and then I can rezz.

5842
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:23,900
That's the only time I can rezz, maybe.

5843
03:18:24,060 --> 03:18:25,180
Yeah, I think so too.

5844
03:18:26,620 --> 03:18:28,640
Because later on I couldn't rezz because of the top team.

5845
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:34,040
No...

5846
03:18:34,040 --> 03:18:37,060
I can't believe they fucking pushed us.

5847
03:18:40,500 --> 03:18:41,380
Fuck me, man.

5848
03:18:41,980 --> 03:18:43,420
Okay, we still have one more game.

5849
03:18:43,640 --> 03:18:44,340
We still have...

5850
03:18:44,480 --> 03:18:44,920
one more.

5851
03:18:45,480 --> 03:18:47,380
Did we even get placement points for it?

5852
03:18:47,580 --> 03:18:48,620
I don't even know what place...

5853
03:18:48,620 --> 03:18:50,140
What place did we get?

5854
03:18:50,660 --> 03:18:52,980
We got one point.

5855
03:18:54,120 --> 03:18:54,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5856
03:19:00,750 --> 03:19:02,210
I can't believe it.

5857
03:19:02,210 --> 03:19:02,970
The backshots.

5858
03:19:05,310 --> 03:19:06,890
The backshots doing work, baby.

5859
03:19:08,950 --> 03:19:09,610
It's okay.

5860
03:19:09,670 --> 03:19:11,010
We got Skippity out.

5861
03:19:11,470 --> 03:19:13,710
We got Skippity and the...

5862
03:19:14,270 --> 03:19:14,770
What was it?

5863
03:19:14,850 --> 03:19:15,330
The rotate.

5864
03:19:15,870 --> 03:19:16,950
So there's still a chance.

5865
03:19:18,510 --> 03:19:19,230
We might...

5866
03:19:19,670 --> 03:19:21,070
It might be over for them.

5867
03:19:22,270 --> 03:19:22,630
Yep.

5868
03:19:26,930 --> 03:19:27,970
That's all we need.

5869
03:19:35,180 --> 03:19:36,540
At least we don't have to wait too long.

5870
03:19:36,780 --> 03:19:37,440
It's like...

5871
03:19:37,440 --> 03:19:38,920
Whoa, five teams left?

5872
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:42,140
Not too long, though.

5873
03:19:43,240 --> 03:19:44,580
Bro, I think we played them wrong.

5874
03:19:44,780 --> 03:19:45,760
Like, I think we should have...

5875
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:48,560
I think she should have popped the Excel so we get bangled.

5876
03:19:48,840 --> 03:19:51,000
And then we hold our back, you know, the stone clothes.

5877
03:19:51,100 --> 03:19:52,000
And then we just play in with...

5878
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:53,020
Yeah.

5879
03:19:53,900 --> 03:19:57,900
Nah, the reason like we lost it is because I died and I fucked up my grapple.

5880
03:19:57,940 --> 03:19:58,980
You know, like I just want it open.

5881
03:19:59,100 --> 03:20:00,320
If I don't do that, we're chilling, bro.

5882
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:01,300
I would have had an off angle.

5883
03:20:02,800 --> 03:20:06,660
Yeah, I couldn't smoke in time, too, because I was a bit behind, guys.

5884
03:20:06,960 --> 03:20:07,980
Because I was ult-excelling.

5885
03:20:09,180 --> 03:20:11,340
Yeah, I think if you didn't die, it would be an easy wipe as well.

5886
03:20:11,400 --> 03:20:13,480
Because I just cracked both of them on the red as well.

5887
03:20:13,540 --> 03:20:14,340
Yeah, that would have been so easy.

5888
03:20:15,120 --> 03:20:16,460
And then I ulted the right.

5889
03:20:18,440 --> 03:20:21,400
Now we know that both of you guys aren't Pathfinder players.

5890
03:20:25,100 --> 03:20:26,220
Nah, that's a path.

5891
03:20:26,500 --> 03:20:27,240
Don't put me in that one.

5892
03:20:34,880 --> 03:20:36,820
What the fuck is going on?

5893
03:20:41,290 --> 03:20:42,670
Oh my god, the backshot.

5894
03:20:43,230 --> 03:20:45,230
Oh my god, and they killed...

5895
03:20:45,230 --> 03:20:46,830
Yeah, they killed the backshots.

5896
03:20:49,450 --> 03:20:50,350
Holy shit.

5897
03:20:52,230 --> 03:20:52,890
It's crazy.

5898
03:20:59,930 --> 03:21:01,090
Oh, they are patient.

5899
03:21:03,510 --> 03:21:04,750
Everybody's playing Rampart.

5900
03:21:04,770 --> 03:21:05,490
It's so cringe.

5901
03:21:06,430 --> 03:21:07,670
It's too much.

5902
03:21:08,270 --> 03:21:10,410
I think we only died to Rampart.

5903
03:21:10,870 --> 03:21:11,350
Once.

5904
03:21:11,350 --> 03:21:11,650
For real.

5905
03:21:12,050 --> 03:21:13,070
In the first game.

5906
03:21:13,210 --> 03:21:13,870
Oh yeah, that's true.

5907
03:21:14,470 --> 03:21:16,150
All our deaths were Rampart.

5908
03:21:21,640 --> 03:21:22,480
Holy shit.

5909
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:25,920
Where's the last...

5910
03:21:27,960 --> 03:21:29,840
Oh, the last team is to the farm, right?

5911
03:21:29,840 --> 03:21:30,940
Oh, they got Devo.

5912
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:31,520
That's fucked.

5913
03:21:32,420 --> 03:21:33,280
Oh my god.

5914
03:21:33,360 --> 03:21:35,060
They're coming in to backshot too.

5915
03:21:39,240 --> 03:21:40,340
They're heading in.

5916
03:21:41,780 --> 03:21:43,180
Which team's gonna win?

5917
03:21:48,500 --> 03:21:49,600
I think it's...

5918
03:21:50,360 --> 03:21:50,920
Oh shit.

5919
03:21:51,420 --> 03:21:53,420
Not drunk ass association.

5920
03:21:55,360 --> 03:21:56,600
These are all new teams.

5921
03:21:56,660 --> 03:21:58,100
Because we killed off the two...

5922
03:21:58,760 --> 03:22:00,740
Because we killed off the top teams.

5923
03:22:00,740 --> 03:22:01,420
These are all...

5924
03:22:01,420 --> 03:22:03,840
The remaining teams are like new teams now.

5925
03:22:04,300 --> 03:22:06,040
We saved the lobby.

5926
03:22:08,320 --> 03:22:08,980
We up.

5927
03:22:09,340 --> 03:22:12,660
We saved the lobby from the terrorizers.

5928
03:22:14,720 --> 03:22:15,420
That's us.

5929
03:22:15,540 --> 03:22:16,160
We did that.

5930
03:22:17,100 --> 03:22:18,380
We cleared the way.

5931
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:19,220
So that more...

5932
03:22:19,220 --> 03:22:21,280
So that more people can have fun.

5933
03:22:23,700 --> 03:22:25,860
And then we purposely died early.

5934
03:22:25,960 --> 03:22:27,840
So more teams can have a chance.

5935
03:22:28,660 --> 03:22:29,380
Kind of.

5936
03:22:29,600 --> 03:22:29,860
Yeah.

5937
03:22:30,740 --> 03:22:31,240
That's our plan, right?

5938
03:22:31,800 --> 03:22:32,220
Yes.

5939
03:22:34,520 --> 03:22:37,080
Yeah, we took those backshots on purpose.

5940
03:22:37,400 --> 03:22:38,160
Yeah, exactly.

5941
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:40,000
I love getting backshots.

5942
03:22:41,580 --> 03:22:42,800
Are we not playing one more?

5943
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:43,280
Are we?

5944
03:22:44,820 --> 03:22:45,340
I don't know.

5945
03:22:46,220 --> 03:22:47,100
It says yes.

5946
03:22:47,960 --> 03:22:49,740
The votes were... Did you guys voted?

5947
03:22:49,960 --> 03:22:50,480
I voted.

5948
03:22:50,820 --> 03:22:51,240
Yeah.

5949
03:22:51,540 --> 03:22:52,660
I took my vote off of...

5950
03:22:53,300 --> 03:22:54,220
Yeah, yeah.

5951
03:22:54,380 --> 03:22:55,780
I took my vote off.

5952
03:22:58,860 --> 03:22:59,900
Should be one more game.

5953
03:23:01,560 --> 03:23:03,280
Everyone said GG's and not living.

5954
03:23:03,380 --> 03:23:04,180
That's the best part.

5955
03:23:07,320 --> 03:23:08,380
Do we vote again?

5956
03:23:08,660 --> 03:23:08,920
No.

5957
03:23:09,140 --> 03:23:10,260
We keep going.

5958
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:14,120
What place are we right now?

5959
03:23:14,320 --> 03:23:14,760
We're fourth.

5960
03:23:16,160 --> 03:23:19,660
We're fourth, but if we get a really good game, we could be second or third.

5961
03:23:20,060 --> 03:23:24,040
Because Loot, Land, Rotate is so help-head that like...

5962
03:23:24,640 --> 03:23:25,460
I don't know.

5963
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:27,180
Unless they get eliminated so early.

5964
03:23:29,100 --> 03:23:29,540
Hmm.

5965
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:32,760
How much points for third?

5966
03:23:33,020 --> 03:23:34,040
Third is 64.

5967
03:23:34,180 --> 03:23:34,740
We're 51.

5968
03:23:36,060 --> 03:23:36,500
Damn.

5969
03:23:36,720 --> 03:23:37,720
I think we called it.

5970
03:23:40,840 --> 03:23:42,980
Bro, I don't think there's a chance for anyone to catch up.

5971
03:23:43,740 --> 03:23:45,620
Oh, people are voting nay.

5972
03:23:45,860 --> 03:23:47,160
Oh, people are voting nay.

5973
03:23:47,260 --> 03:23:48,460
I think that's last game then.

5974
03:23:49,180 --> 03:23:49,620
Nah.

5975
03:23:50,200 --> 03:23:52,100
Over 30 yes to work.

5976
03:23:53,060 --> 03:23:53,500
What?

5977
03:23:54,560 --> 03:23:54,960
What?

5978
03:23:55,320 --> 03:23:57,460
You need to have 30 people to say yes.

5979
03:23:58,460 --> 03:23:59,000
Oh, shit.

5980
03:23:59,000 --> 03:23:59,940
Where's the fucking thingy again?

5981
03:24:00,860 --> 03:24:02,640
Can I invite people in to vote yes?

5982
03:24:06,400 --> 03:24:09,320
Bro, my pizza is gonna be mad at you.

5983
03:24:09,940 --> 03:24:11,740
Bro, you could eat your pizza right now.

5984
03:24:12,340 --> 03:24:13,500
I don't want to, bro.

5985
03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:14,820
Why am I gonna eat it with a fork?

5986
03:24:15,500 --> 03:24:19,520
Bro, in fact, if we win this game, we get prize money.

5987
03:24:20,220 --> 03:24:20,800
Yeah, bro.

5988
03:24:21,080 --> 03:24:22,780
Bro, do you not want prize money?

5989
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:24,900
Take that no away.

5990
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:28,280
In fact, take that no away and then put that yeah in.

5991
03:24:29,100 --> 03:24:30,760
I'm watching it right now.

5992
03:24:30,920 --> 03:24:31,740
Take that nay.

5993
03:24:31,960 --> 03:24:35,720
Take that no away right now and make it a tie.

5994
03:24:36,900 --> 03:24:37,420
Okay.

5995
03:24:39,120 --> 03:24:40,620
Yeah, there we go.

5996
03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:42,820
Peer pressure works, guys.

5997
03:24:43,380 --> 03:24:44,900
Peer pressure works.

5998
03:24:47,820 --> 03:24:48,700
I'm so stupid.

5999
03:24:48,780 --> 03:24:49,820
I don't find the voting thingy.

6000
03:24:49,980 --> 03:24:51,760
Oh, is that the restart request?

6001
03:24:52,240 --> 03:24:52,940
Just vote...

6002
03:24:53,500 --> 03:24:54,960
Yes, we put yay.

6003
03:24:56,420 --> 03:24:57,100
I hear.

6004
03:24:57,560 --> 03:25:00,340
Unlucky, you better put yay because it's...

6005
03:25:02,800 --> 03:25:05,220
Take that nay away, in fact.

6006
03:25:05,480 --> 03:25:07,200
Unlucky, unvote that.

6007
03:25:07,240 --> 03:25:08,380
We need it to be...

6008
03:25:08,940 --> 03:25:10,380
Unvote that right now.

6009
03:25:10,960 --> 03:25:11,900
I'm fucking dying.

6010
03:25:12,220 --> 03:25:13,200
Bro, in fact, that's a no.

6011
03:25:13,740 --> 03:25:15,420
In fact, take that away.

6012
03:25:15,420 --> 03:25:17,640
Put that shit right off.

6013
03:25:17,740 --> 03:25:18,700
We need third place.

6014
03:25:18,740 --> 03:25:22,420
In fact, get your ass out of there.

6015
03:25:23,520 --> 03:25:23,880
We need third.

6016
03:25:24,120 --> 03:25:25,300
We need third, in fact.

6017
03:25:25,520 --> 03:25:26,520
I need money, bro.

6018
03:25:26,680 --> 03:25:28,440
In fact, we need money for the bro.

6019
03:25:30,020 --> 03:25:31,220
I have it on yeah, bro.

6020
03:25:31,300 --> 03:25:32,180
I'm just spamming nay now.

6021
03:25:32,420 --> 03:25:32,960
Just don't.

6022
03:25:33,040 --> 03:25:35,100
If we spam nay, they're gonna put nay.

6023
03:25:35,760 --> 03:25:37,780
In fact, get your no off of there.

6024
03:25:38,260 --> 03:25:40,100
I'm getting fake accounts in here.

6025
03:25:44,700 --> 03:25:47,520
In fact, I swear to god, in fact, get that nay out there.

6026
03:25:47,760 --> 03:25:48,520
I'm doing nothing.

6027
03:25:48,680 --> 03:25:49,740
I'm not touching my mouse.

6028
03:25:49,740 --> 03:25:50,600
I swear to god.

6029
03:25:50,660 --> 03:25:52,700
I swear to god.

6030
03:25:52,760 --> 03:25:54,660
If I see your hand...

6031
03:25:54,660 --> 03:25:58,520
If I open your stream and I see that on nay, I swear to god.

6032
03:25:59,920 --> 03:26:01,200
Click on my emoticon.

6033
03:26:01,440 --> 03:26:01,780
The last one.

6034
03:26:03,300 --> 03:26:05,100
I swear to god, in fact.

6035
03:26:05,300 --> 03:26:07,600
We need that pizza.

6036
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:09,580
We need that $75.

6037
03:26:10,180 --> 03:26:10,580
I need money, bro.

6038
03:26:10,720 --> 03:26:11,220
Come on.

6039
03:26:11,440 --> 03:26:12,540
Come on, bro.

6040
03:26:12,800 --> 03:26:13,840
We need that money.

6041
03:26:15,040 --> 03:26:15,520
Bro!

6042
03:26:15,820 --> 03:26:17,580
Okay, I don't need it, but like...

6043
03:26:17,580 --> 03:26:19,000
Unlucky needs that money.

6044
03:26:19,740 --> 03:26:20,460
That's what I'm saying.

6045
03:26:21,440 --> 03:26:22,680
I need money.

6046
03:26:22,920 --> 03:26:25,200
Guys, do it for your homie.

6047
03:26:29,080 --> 03:26:30,740
DM everyone who said no.

6048
03:26:31,180 --> 03:26:32,040
DM everyone.

6049
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:34,040
DM everybody.

6050
03:26:36,340 --> 03:26:38,080
Everybody that says no.

6051
03:26:38,340 --> 03:26:39,720
I swear to god.

6052
03:26:40,420 --> 03:26:42,240
You guys don't want fun?

6053
03:26:42,780 --> 03:26:43,300
Nah,

6054
03:26:46,400 --> 03:26:47,140
it's going down, bro.

6055
03:26:47,180 --> 03:26:48,460
It went from 27 to 24.

6056
03:26:49,740 --> 03:26:50,540
Was that your fault?

6057
03:26:50,780 --> 03:26:51,300
Definitely.

6058
03:26:54,340 --> 03:26:55,780
How dare you.

6059
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:58,040
Help the sick.

6060
03:26:58,300 --> 03:26:58,820
Exactly.

6061
03:26:59,080 --> 03:26:59,620
You gotta help.

6062
03:26:59,760 --> 03:27:01,540
Donate to the sick right now.

6063
03:27:04,940 --> 03:27:06,940
How could you do this to us?

6064
03:27:11,470 --> 03:27:12,190
How could you do this to us?

6065
03:27:12,210 --> 03:27:13,090
Oh my god.

6066
03:27:13,170 --> 03:27:14,510
It's literally so close.

6067
03:27:15,630 --> 03:27:16,930
We need like...

6068
03:27:16,930 --> 03:27:18,090
We need like...

6069
03:27:18,090 --> 03:27:20,950
We need like 2 more people to vote.

6070
03:27:21,050 --> 03:27:21,250
Yay.

6071
03:27:23,850 --> 03:27:25,750
We literally need 2 more people.

6072
03:27:27,230 --> 03:27:29,130
I don't understand why they don't want to play another game.

6073
03:27:29,790 --> 03:27:31,150
It's like literally just one more.

6074
03:27:31,250 --> 03:27:31,850
There's 3 people left.

6075
03:27:31,950 --> 03:27:33,230
There's 3 people left who need to vote.

6076
03:27:33,410 --> 03:27:33,850
No, 2.

6077
03:27:33,930 --> 03:27:35,230
We need 2 people to vote.

6078
03:27:35,730 --> 03:27:37,350
I will create another account.

6079
03:27:37,490 --> 03:27:38,890
Join it and then vote.

6080
03:27:40,310 --> 03:27:41,590
What if I change my second?

6081
03:27:41,670 --> 03:27:42,230
No, no.

6082
03:27:42,250 --> 03:27:42,930
Don't you dare.

6083
03:27:45,270 --> 03:27:46,970
I'm gassing like everyone in the chat right now.

6084
03:27:49,930 --> 03:27:50,990
What are you saying?

6085
03:27:50,990 --> 03:27:52,610
What did you say?

6086
03:27:52,770 --> 03:27:53,710
I don't want that.

6087
03:27:59,130 --> 03:28:00,950
I don't even know what you said.

6088
03:28:01,030 --> 03:28:01,510
Oh, here you go.

6089
03:28:01,910 --> 03:28:03,410
I see Yahoo is on.

6090
03:28:08,670 --> 03:28:10,170
Do it for EU.

6091
03:28:10,570 --> 03:28:12,050
Do it for Unlucky.

6092
03:28:12,250 --> 03:28:13,650
Bro, he's been so unlucky.

6093
03:28:13,850 --> 03:28:14,690
He needs this.

6094
03:28:16,450 --> 03:28:16,930
Yeah.

6095
03:28:17,590 --> 03:28:20,510
Bro, Unlucky just wants to play more.

6096
03:28:23,870 --> 03:28:25,010
Do it for him.

6097
03:28:31,730 --> 03:28:32,290
Do it for him.

6098
03:28:32,290 --> 03:28:32,710
He got you.

6099
03:28:40,710 --> 03:28:42,330
I can't believe it.

6100
03:28:42,350 --> 03:28:43,530
Now they're voting less.

6101
03:28:44,030 --> 03:28:45,450
Unlucky, what did you do?

6102
03:28:45,690 --> 03:28:47,470
They took away their votes afterwards.

6103
03:28:49,150 --> 03:28:50,390
Blame it all on Unlucky.

6104
03:28:52,830 --> 03:28:55,650
They actually took away the votes after.

6105
03:29:14,780 --> 03:29:15,680
Fuck, man.

6106
03:29:15,780 --> 03:29:16,440
I tried my best.

6107
03:29:19,040 --> 03:29:19,480
Alright.

6108
03:29:19,860 --> 03:29:20,580
GG's, guys.

6109
03:29:20,820 --> 03:29:21,660
That was fun, though.

6110
03:29:22,140 --> 03:29:22,920
It was.

6111
03:29:23,720 --> 03:29:26,260
If I wasn't so crooked, it would've been more fun.

6112
03:29:27,600 --> 03:29:29,000
We definitely sold a lot.

6113
03:29:29,080 --> 03:29:29,480
It's okay.

6114
03:29:29,760 --> 03:29:32,700
Do you guys want to do a team again next time?

6115
03:29:32,720 --> 03:29:33,560
In Revenge Arc?

6116
03:29:34,180 --> 03:29:34,620
Yeah.

6117
03:29:36,200 --> 03:29:37,640
That was really fun.

6118
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:40,680
Next time, if I get another invite to a tournament, we run it back.

6119
03:29:42,760 --> 03:29:44,700
We run it back and then we'll...

6120
03:29:44,700 --> 03:29:45,600
We run it back and then we'll...

6121
03:29:46,260 --> 03:29:47,440
Let's get a hold of them, bro.

6122
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:50,660
Yeah, and then we'll both not be sick.

6123
03:29:50,900 --> 03:29:54,120
And then Unlucky's mind won't be super cooked.

6124
03:29:54,380 --> 03:29:56,140
And then Unlucky's mind won't be super cooked.

6125
03:29:56,140 --> 03:29:57,280
And he won't be too freaky.

6126
03:29:57,400 --> 03:29:57,480
And he won't be too freaky.

6127
03:29:57,580 --> 03:30:00,160
He was so distracted.

6128
03:30:00,200 --> 03:30:01,080
That's my freak.

6129
03:30:01,120 --> 03:30:01,480
That's crazy.

6130
03:30:01,700 --> 03:30:04,340
Yeah, he was so distracted and so freaked out.

6131
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:05,800
I am.

6132
03:30:05,960 --> 03:30:06,940
What can I say?

6133
03:30:08,100 --> 03:30:09,000
I'm just locked.

6134
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:09,600
Yeah.

6135
03:30:10,420 --> 03:30:13,040
Yeah, you've been too fucking freaky.

6136
03:30:13,160 --> 03:30:14,200
But that was fun, though.

6137
03:30:14,260 --> 03:30:15,200
I had so much fun playing.

6138
03:30:15,800 --> 03:30:17,080
I hope you guys sleep well.

6139
03:30:17,280 --> 03:30:19,060
And Unlucky, you get better soon.

6140
03:30:19,180 --> 03:30:19,880
Like, overall.

6141
03:30:22,100 --> 03:30:23,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6142
03:30:23,560 --> 03:30:24,560
I appreciate it.

6143
03:30:24,640 --> 03:30:25,500
Thank you so much, Steve.

6144
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:25,920
Thank you.

6145
03:30:26,180 --> 03:30:26,720
GG's, guys.

6146
03:30:27,960 --> 03:30:28,360
GG's.

6147
03:30:28,560 --> 03:30:29,020
Bye-bye.

6148
03:30:29,420 --> 03:30:31,060
Let's play again next time.

6149
03:30:31,120 --> 03:30:31,660
Run it back.

6150
03:30:31,980 --> 03:30:32,480
Yes, sir.

6151
03:30:32,740 --> 03:30:33,240
Bye-bye.

6152
03:30:33,800 --> 03:30:34,320
Bye-bye.

6153
03:30:35,840 --> 03:30:36,660
That was fun!

6154
03:30:36,660 --> 03:30:37,840
That was a lot of fun.

6155
03:30:38,120 --> 03:30:40,140
Like, I'm surprised how well we did.

6156
03:30:40,500 --> 03:30:44,140
For, like, how fucking fucked up we were.

6157
03:30:44,880 --> 03:30:48,300
We were so fucked up.

6158
03:30:48,720 --> 03:30:50,040
Overall, as a team.

6159
03:30:50,220 --> 03:31:01,500
In terms of, like, not like we had really good chemistry, but, like, we were just, like, we were sick and, like, we were fucking around so much.

6160
03:31:01,920 --> 03:31:02,400
Yeah.

6161
03:31:05,220 --> 03:31:07,120
Both sick and freaky.

6162
03:31:07,620 --> 03:31:08,040
Yeah.

6163
03:31:11,720 --> 03:31:12,500
Yeah, yeah.

6164
03:31:12,540 --> 03:31:15,400
That game where they fucking carried when I was in the back.

6165
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:16,860
Yeah, we were trolling so much.

6166
03:31:16,920 --> 03:31:18,800
We literally had two games with zero points.

6167
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:23,760
We had two games with zero points because we were getting way too freaky.

6168
03:31:27,500 --> 03:31:28,880
We were like, you know what?

6169
03:31:29,800 --> 03:31:33,280
Two of my teammates with 200 ping, let's fucking push that shit.

6170
03:31:33,600 --> 03:31:34,020
Let's...

6171
03:31:37,820 --> 03:31:38,380
Let's...

6172
03:31:38,380 --> 03:31:39,640
Let's fucking do it.

6173
03:31:41,140 --> 03:31:42,580
And then we got...

6174
03:31:42,580 --> 03:31:44,520
We got too... We were so...

6175
03:31:44,520 --> 03:31:47,040
We got backshots like crazy there.

6176
03:31:50,680 --> 03:31:51,800
Yeah, yeah.

6177
03:31:51,980 --> 03:31:53,300
What could go wrong?

6178
03:31:53,540 --> 03:31:55,620
I think if the last game...

6179
03:31:55,620 --> 03:31:58,340
If the last game we played more...

6180
03:31:58,340 --> 03:32:02,760
Like, a lot of the tryhard teams were playing so fucking safe with zones and everything.

6181
03:32:03,020 --> 03:32:06,540
And then my team, we were just fucking... We were just fucking around.

6182
03:32:06,660 --> 03:32:08,040
Like, going after people.

6183
03:32:08,800 --> 03:32:11,500
Like, I was trying to be like, guys, slow down, please.

6184
03:32:11,940 --> 03:32:13,100
Guys, I'm fine.

6185
03:32:15,580 --> 03:32:16,840
I'm like, trying to run over.

6186
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:17,660
I'm like, please.

6187
03:32:18,060 --> 03:32:19,980
Please slow down.

6188
03:32:20,640 --> 03:32:23,640
I need... I need... I can't keep up.

6189
03:32:27,220 --> 03:32:29,380
We're playing a different game.

6190
03:32:29,520 --> 03:32:33,140
Yeah, we were... We were just killing... Our team was just here to kill.

6191
03:32:33,520 --> 03:32:36,780
Not for... We were not doing position... No IGL.

6192
03:32:36,880 --> 03:32:42,720
Bro, we literally... We were playing the tournament as if...

6193
03:32:42,720 --> 03:32:44,300
As if it was a pub.

6194
03:32:44,680 --> 03:32:46,120
I swear.

6195
03:32:46,540 --> 03:32:48,760
This did not feel like a tournament.

6196
03:32:48,900 --> 03:32:52,340
We were just playing a game as if it was a fucking pub.

6197
03:32:52,740 --> 03:32:53,420
Like...

6198
03:32:54,420 --> 03:32:55,300
So true.

6199
03:32:57,760 --> 03:33:01,140
We were not... We were not playing tournament style.

6200
03:33:05,340 --> 03:33:08,700
But it was fun though.

6201
03:33:08,740 --> 03:33:09,880
It was really fun playing.

6202
03:33:10,540 --> 03:33:12,240
It was really fun playing with them.

6203
03:33:12,320 --> 03:33:15,220
Even though we were just... It was literally pub style.

6204
03:33:15,460 --> 03:33:16,940
But it was so fucking fun though.

6205
03:33:17,500 --> 03:33:19,000
Playing it pub-like.

6206
03:33:20,180 --> 03:33:20,620
And...

6207
03:33:20,620 --> 03:33:22,120
Because we were not thinking.

6208
03:33:22,340 --> 03:33:24,700
We were not thinking at all.

6209
03:33:24,900 --> 03:33:27,400
Because I was like, oh guys, this doesn't seem right.

6210
03:33:27,600 --> 03:33:28,560
And then they were already there.

6211
03:33:28,660 --> 03:33:29,280
So I was like, okay.

6212
03:33:30,320 --> 03:33:34,120
But they were like, they were like, we're gonna dump... We're gonna kill that team.

6213
03:33:34,260 --> 03:33:35,240
And then that team.

6214
03:33:35,380 --> 03:33:36,300
And then that team.

6215
03:33:36,560 --> 03:33:38,540
And I'm just like, I don't know guys.

6216
03:33:38,540 --> 03:33:41,340
I don't know if that's... I feel like maybe we should stop.

6217
03:33:41,520 --> 03:33:41,980
They're like, no.

6218
03:33:42,180 --> 03:33:43,500
We're gonna still go on.

6219
03:33:43,580 --> 03:33:44,380
And then we died.

6220
03:33:44,460 --> 03:33:45,260
I'm like, okay.

6221
03:33:48,520 --> 03:33:50,460
I was like, okay.

6222
03:33:51,500 --> 03:33:51,940
But...

6223
03:33:53,460 --> 03:33:54,720
We're just running it down.

6224
03:33:55,860 --> 03:33:57,080
Full W key.

6225
03:33:57,240 --> 03:33:58,160
It was worth it.

6226
03:33:58,260 --> 03:33:59,840
I mean, the fact that we got...

6227
03:33:59,840 --> 03:34:01,040
We got so many points.

6228
03:34:02,560 --> 03:34:03,440
Even though...

6229
03:34:05,360 --> 03:34:06,520
We got so many points.

6230
03:34:06,600 --> 03:34:08,280
Even though we had two games with zero points.

6231
03:34:08,460 --> 03:34:09,380
It's actually... It's been fun.

6232
03:34:10,540 --> 03:34:11,020
Um...

6233
03:34:11,020 --> 03:34:11,480
I'm sorry.

6234
03:34:11,560 --> 03:34:12,360
I'm so sick.

6235
03:34:13,540 --> 03:34:14,980
I'm so fucking...

6236
03:34:14,980 --> 03:34:16,540
I'm so fucked up right now.

6237
03:34:17,260 --> 03:34:17,740
Um...

6238
03:34:18,680 --> 03:34:23,100
I'm gonna message the babysitter to take care of dad for another extra day.

6239
03:34:23,320 --> 03:34:25,000
Cause I was supposed to get him back tomorrow.

6240
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:29,180
But like, I still need that extra day to like, recover.

6241
03:34:29,480 --> 03:34:31,680
Cause I'm like, I'm so fucked up right now.

6242
03:34:31,980 --> 03:34:32,460
Um...

6243
03:34:32,460 --> 03:34:34,860
We still were gonna try and do Silent Hill 2.

6244
03:34:34,920 --> 03:34:37,000
The reviews came out overall positive.

6245
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:38,020
I was so surprised.

6246
03:34:38,340 --> 03:34:40,480
Cause everybody was like, dooming over...

6247
03:34:40,480 --> 03:34:43,740
Everybody was like, dooming about, um...

6248
03:34:43,740 --> 03:34:45,380
About the, uh...

6249
03:34:45,380 --> 03:34:48,080
The, um...

6250
03:34:48,080 --> 03:34:49,160
The Silent Hill 2.

6251
03:34:49,340 --> 03:34:52,560
But like, there's so many overall good reviews.

6252
03:34:52,860 --> 03:34:56,580
Cause I know people are like, Yeah, but this review site tends to have not good reviews.

6253
03:34:56,800 --> 03:34:58,080
But, um...

6254
03:34:58,080 --> 03:35:00,540
It was overall very positive.

6255
03:35:00,620 --> 03:35:02,120
And like, multiple websites.

6256
03:35:02,500 --> 03:35:03,780
Like, multiple reviewers.

6257
03:35:04,140 --> 03:35:05,640
Multiple, uh...

6258
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:09,140
People were saying it actually was pretty good.

6259
03:35:09,400 --> 03:35:10,460
For, um...

6260
03:35:10,460 --> 03:35:11,080
For a remake.

6261
03:35:11,380 --> 03:35:12,760
Cause there was a lot of doomers.

6262
03:35:13,060 --> 03:35:15,960
So I'm really excited to try out Silent Hill 2 now.

6263
03:35:16,140 --> 03:35:17,740
I'm very scared because I never...

6264
03:35:17,740 --> 03:35:21,120
The first time I ever tried Silent Hill 2, It was me with my friend.

6265
03:35:21,360 --> 03:35:24,120
And we bought the remastered, like the trilogy remastered.

6266
03:35:24,240 --> 03:35:27,900
And then we literally tried to play Silent Hill 3 For like, three sec...

6267
03:35:27,900 --> 03:35:29,600
For like, the mall part.

6268
03:35:29,800 --> 03:35:32,040
And then we closed the game and went to play Epic Mickey.

6269
03:35:32,320 --> 03:35:33,940
Like, Epic Mickey 2.

6270
03:35:34,120 --> 03:35:35,580
Cause we were like, this is too scary.

6271
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:38,160
It was in the day.

6272
03:35:38,380 --> 03:35:39,780
And then I had the controller.

6273
03:35:39,940 --> 03:35:41,680
And my friend was watching me try to play it.

6274
03:35:41,780 --> 03:35:43,240
And then we closed the game.

6275
03:35:43,480 --> 03:35:45,020
After we got to the mall scene.

6276
03:35:45,200 --> 03:35:47,500
Like, where they all turn into monsters in the mall scene.

6277
03:35:47,800 --> 03:35:50,200
And then we closed the game and played Epic Mickey 2.

6278
03:35:50,320 --> 03:35:51,600
Cause we were like, this is too much.

6279
03:35:51,720 --> 03:35:52,320
This is...

6280
03:35:56,780 --> 03:35:57,180
Um...

6281
03:35:58,820 --> 03:35:59,440
But yeah.

6282
03:35:59,540 --> 03:36:01,000
I hope that...

6283
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:02,480
I hope it'll be really fun.

6284
03:36:02,640 --> 03:36:06,140
I honestly hope that Silent Hill 2 will be very enjoyable.

6285
03:36:06,140 --> 03:36:06,780
Anyway guys!

6286
03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:07,900
I'm gonna head off now.

6287
03:36:08,100 --> 03:36:09,800
I am tired.

6288
03:36:10,480 --> 03:36:13,860
I'm gonna rest up a little bit until 9pm.

6289
03:36:14,300 --> 03:36:15,440
The release day.

6290
03:36:15,640 --> 03:36:16,240
I'm gonna...

6291
03:36:16,240 --> 03:36:19,040
But it was really fun to play with Effect and Unlucky.

6292
03:36:19,200 --> 03:36:21,480
I had an amazing time with both of them.

6293
03:36:21,600 --> 03:36:23,740
I'm glad they started opening up more.

6294
03:36:23,940 --> 03:36:26,340
And like, not being super serious.

6295
03:36:26,400 --> 03:36:28,040
And just fucking around, you know.

6296
03:36:28,060 --> 03:36:30,360
That's what I like about interacting with new people.

6297
03:36:30,940 --> 03:36:33,160
And just like, seeing them loosen up.

6298
03:36:33,160 --> 03:36:34,560
And um...

6299
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:36,660
Loosen up and just like, you know.

6300
03:36:36,680 --> 03:36:38,080
Being super fun.

6301
03:36:38,300 --> 03:36:39,540
And just fucking around.

6302
03:36:39,900 --> 03:36:42,640
I love vibes like that.

6303
03:36:42,840 --> 03:36:44,220
I like those types of vibes.

6304
03:36:44,340 --> 03:36:45,920
So I'm happy to...

6305
03:36:46,620 --> 03:36:49,240
To have those vibes playing the tournament.

6306
03:36:49,540 --> 03:36:49,940
Um...

6307
03:36:49,940 --> 03:36:51,360
And we traded like a pub.

6308
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:55,200
I mean, we did pretty well for trading like a pub.

6309
03:36:55,320 --> 03:36:55,740
So that's...

6310
03:36:55,740 --> 03:36:56,420
Fuck yeah!

6311
03:36:58,360 --> 03:36:58,880
Also...

6312
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:01,680
There's a little fucking tidbit.

6313
03:37:03,160 --> 03:37:05,720
Like Kuno was apparently gonna be in this tournament.

6314
03:37:06,240 --> 03:37:06,640
Um...

6315
03:37:06,640 --> 03:37:08,940
But then I told him, cause he wanted me as a third.

6316
03:37:09,280 --> 03:37:10,680
And I was like, bro...

6317
03:37:10,680 --> 03:37:12,120
You need a pro player.

6318
03:37:12,260 --> 03:37:13,920
Or you're not gonna have a good time.

6319
03:37:14,120 --> 03:37:14,960
And he was like, what?

6320
03:37:15,160 --> 03:37:17,500
And I was like, bro, this tournament is not for fun.

6321
03:37:17,620 --> 03:37:17,980
Like...

6322
03:37:20,800 --> 03:37:22,060
And he was like...

6323
03:37:22,060 --> 03:37:24,860
And I think his team dropped out cause they saw the team roster.

6324
03:37:25,080 --> 03:37:26,020
And they're like, yeah, no.

6325
03:37:26,420 --> 03:37:28,620
And then his team was like, yeah, we're not playing this.

6326
03:37:29,280 --> 03:37:29,680
Like...

6327
03:37:31,140 --> 03:37:32,860
I was like, bro, I'm captain.

6328
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:33,540
And I'm like...

6329
03:37:33,540 --> 03:37:35,260
I'm picking up pro players because...

6330
03:37:35,260 --> 03:37:36,480
Because like...

6331
03:37:36,480 --> 03:37:38,020
Because it's like...

6332
03:37:38,020 --> 03:37:41,800
The roster seems so fucking sweaty.

6333
03:37:42,160 --> 03:37:43,820
And then he dropped out.

6334
03:37:43,920 --> 03:37:44,540
Cause he was like...

6335
03:37:44,540 --> 03:37:48,520
Cause I was like, bro, there's some players in there that are going to fucking LAN.

6336
03:37:48,820 --> 03:37:50,600
Like actually going to LAN.

6337
03:37:53,940 --> 03:37:54,420
Realize...

6338
03:37:54,420 --> 03:37:55,520
Yeah, he almost got...

6339
03:37:55,520 --> 03:37:56,320
He almost played.

6340
03:37:56,420 --> 03:37:57,520
And I was like, bro, no.

6341
03:37:57,900 --> 03:37:59,200
No, you're not going to have fun.

6342
03:37:59,400 --> 03:38:00,140
I swear to God.

6343
03:38:00,340 --> 03:38:03,560
Like if you bump into any of these teams, you're not going to have fun.

6344
03:38:03,620 --> 03:38:04,360
I swear to God.

6345
03:38:12,080 --> 03:38:12,480
So...

6346
03:38:13,360 --> 03:38:14,140
So that...

6347
03:38:14,140 --> 03:38:14,780
So like...

6348
03:38:14,780 --> 03:38:16,280
I saved him there.

6349
03:38:16,480 --> 03:38:18,440
Cause I told him like...

6350
03:38:18,440 --> 03:38:19,480
I'm not...

6351
03:38:19,480 --> 03:38:20,560
Get a pro player, bro.

6352
03:38:20,660 --> 03:38:22,800
Don't get like a random person for your third.

6353
03:38:22,800 --> 03:38:24,540
Cause I don't remember who his first was.

6354
03:38:24,620 --> 03:38:26,140
But the first player was not like pro.

6355
03:38:26,360 --> 03:38:27,980
But I was like, bro, get a pro player.

6356
03:38:28,300 --> 03:38:29,120
Like it's not going to...

6357
03:38:29,120 --> 03:38:30,580
You're going to need it.

6358
03:38:31,220 --> 03:38:32,380
You're going to be running away.

6359
03:38:32,640 --> 03:38:34,080
You're going to be fucking fodder.

6360
03:38:34,220 --> 03:38:38,700
You're going to be fodder for these people, bro.

6361
03:38:38,840 --> 03:38:39,800
You got to get a pro.

6362
03:38:44,580 --> 03:38:46,020
You scared him off.

6363
03:38:46,300 --> 03:38:47,040
I had to.

6364
03:38:47,600 --> 03:38:49,400
I didn't want him to be miserable.

6365
03:38:49,800 --> 03:38:51,360
I didn't want him to be miserable.

6366
03:38:52,540 --> 03:38:52,940
Um...

6367
03:38:54,460 --> 03:38:55,680
I didn't want him to be miserable playing.

6368
03:38:55,800 --> 03:38:56,880
Cause that's not the fun part.

6369
03:38:56,980 --> 03:38:58,520
When you die early, it's not fun.

6370
03:38:58,740 --> 03:39:00,880
Like we died early twice.

6371
03:39:01,020 --> 03:39:02,680
And we had to like sit there.

6372
03:39:04,140 --> 03:39:06,080
Like we had to sit there.

6373
03:39:06,300 --> 03:39:07,100
Cause we fought.

6374
03:39:07,600 --> 03:39:08,580
It's just unlucky.

6375
03:39:08,760 --> 03:39:10,080
The two teams we...

6376
03:39:12,660 --> 03:39:13,160
Um...

6377
03:39:13,980 --> 03:39:16,220
The two teams we fought...

6378
03:39:17,280 --> 03:39:18,920
Fought was like...

6379
03:39:18,920 --> 03:39:19,780
Um...

6380
03:39:20,290 --> 03:39:21,820
We fought were like...

6381
03:39:22,580 --> 03:39:24,220
The pro teams too.

6382
03:39:24,460 --> 03:39:25,300
Like I think like...

6383
03:39:25,300 --> 03:39:27,000
When we died early...

6384
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:29,160
Both the teams we fought were the pro teams.

6385
03:39:29,460 --> 03:39:30,960
So like it was very...

6386
03:39:30,960 --> 03:39:32,180
It was very scary.

6387
03:39:33,080 --> 03:39:34,920
It was very scary.

6388
03:39:37,640 --> 03:39:38,080
Um...

6389
03:39:40,680 --> 03:39:42,400
So yeah, but we got them.

6390
03:39:42,620 --> 03:39:43,580
We took them out.

6391
03:39:43,820 --> 03:39:46,880
The moment we took out Skip, we did it for everybody.

6392
03:39:47,380 --> 03:39:48,680
I think if we knew...

6393
03:39:48,680 --> 03:39:51,740
I think if we knew that there wasn't going to be a last game...

6394
03:39:51,740 --> 03:39:53,540
I think we would have definitely played a lot more safe.

6395
03:39:53,600 --> 03:39:55,500
I just went in thinking we have another game.

6396
03:39:55,760 --> 03:39:56,180
I...

6397
03:39:57,120 --> 03:39:58,020
But that's fine.

6398
03:39:58,160 --> 03:39:59,080
We still did really well.

6399
03:39:59,280 --> 03:40:01,020
Anyway guys, we got Skippity.

6400
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:01,940
We're the people's champion.

6401
03:40:02,140 --> 03:40:04,420
We literally got Skippity out for everybody.

6402
03:40:07,900 --> 03:40:09,660
Anyway, I'm going to head off now.

6403
03:40:09,780 --> 03:40:11,440
I am going to rest up.

6404
03:40:11,460 --> 03:40:13,400
My voice is dying and um...

6405
03:40:13,400 --> 03:40:14,380
I need to...

6406
03:40:14,380 --> 03:40:17,100
I need to take my meds for real.

6407
03:40:17,280 --> 03:40:18,840
And I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6408
03:40:19,060 --> 03:40:19,660
I hope you guys have fun.

6409
03:40:19,860 --> 03:40:20,700
As always everybody...

6410
03:40:20,700 --> 03:40:21,980
stay hydrated, posture checked.

6411
03:40:22,060 --> 03:40:23,860
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6412
03:40:23,920 --> 03:40:24,980
You stay up for me, head to bed.

6413
03:40:25,080 --> 03:40:25,900
Because you deserve it.

6414
03:40:25,980 --> 03:40:27,360
I really want to play with this team again.

6415
03:40:27,460 --> 03:40:29,080
When we're all feeling a lot better.

6416
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:30,260
They were really fun to play with.

6417
03:40:30,580 --> 03:40:34,820
So I'm super down to play with Effect and Unlucky again.

6418
03:40:34,860 --> 03:40:36,320
For like a run back.

6419
03:40:36,420 --> 03:40:37,640
When we're all healthy.

6420
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:38,880
And like...

6421
03:40:39,340 --> 03:40:42,380
When we're all healthy and not fucked up.

6422
03:40:43,840 --> 03:40:45,900
When we're all feeling more freaky.

6423
03:40:46,720 --> 03:40:48,420
But yeah, I hope we can play again.

6424
03:40:48,880 --> 03:40:50,180
I hope there's another tournament...

6425
03:40:50,700 --> 03:40:51,020
and we can get them in.

6426
03:40:51,580 --> 03:40:52,920
But yeah, I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6427
03:40:53,160 --> 03:40:53,720
Bye guys.

6428
03:40:54,040 --> 03:40:54,400
Bye!
