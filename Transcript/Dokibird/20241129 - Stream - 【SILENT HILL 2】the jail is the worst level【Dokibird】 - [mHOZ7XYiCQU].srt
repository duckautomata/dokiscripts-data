1
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,190
Hello everybody, hello, hello.

2
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,390
Oh, 1230 Street.

3
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,350
Oh, wait, you're not alive on my screen.

4
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,150
Give me a sec.

5
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,050
You're not alive.

6
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,890
Give me a sec.

7
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,810
I can fix you.

8
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,630
I can always fix you.

9
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,010
Alright, there we go.

10
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,150
Now you're alive.

11
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,390
Hello, everybody.

12
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,570
I am... I'm a little dead inside.

13
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,030
Cause like, for those who don't know, 1230 is Doki's dead hour.

14
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,310
It's me waiting to wake up hours.

15
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,390
Oh my god, I am not a normal person.

16
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,190
I'm not a morning person at all.

17
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,190
Alright, life update.

18
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,070
Wow, Doki.

19
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,390
We had like one plus hour of life update yesterday.

20
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,510
What do you mean there's more?

21
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,030
More stuff happened.

22
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,830
So, no, it's just a tiny life update.

23
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:53,010
So, the last like month and a half, I've been wondering why is it so cold like lately?

24
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,670
Like, why has it been so cold lately in my apartment?

25
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,030
Cause I was so confused.

26
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,550
I was like, this is weird.

27
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,990
Like, this shouldn't be this cold because I have a heater, right?

28
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:17,710
And like, it's at... and then it's been... I've been increasing the temperature like every other day.

29
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:23,570
So, it was at 36 degrees Celsius, like the temperature that I increased it to.

30
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,570
But it was still cold.

31
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,810
So, I was like... like, it was just like a bit cold.

32
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,850
So, I was like, do I have windows open?

33
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,910
I was very confused.

34
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,510
And for those who... for you Americans who are like, the fuck is Celsius?

35
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,470
Okay, 36 Celsius to Fahrenheit.

36
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,930
That is 96.8 Fahrenheit.

37
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,690
So, I was very confused.

38
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,750
Like, why is it cold?

39
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:01,270
And then, I looked at my... the temperature thing, the temperature button thing.

40
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,770
And I was like, there's something wrong.

41
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,750
And I looked at it.

42
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,730
And then, I was like, wait a minute.

43
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,150
Why does it say cooling?

44
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:27,110
And then, I was like, wait, there's modes on this.

45
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,610
There's... there's modes.

46
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,330
So, I clicked on the mode and it changed the heat.

47
00:04:45,890 --> 00:05:01,050
So, I found out that for a month and a half, when it was... when I was increasing the temperature, I was actually using the air conditioning instead of the heater.

48
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:08,090
So, I was accidentally... that's... that's why it felt cold.

49
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:14,110
It was just blowing cold air, even though it was supposed to be at like 36 degrees.

50
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,270
It was blowing cold air.

51
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,530
So, that's why I was like, oh, so that's why I was feeling cold.

52
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,930
No wonder.

53
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,350
So, now, I didn't put it... obviously, I didn't put it at 36 degrees for heating.

54
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,390
I turned it down after that because I was like, oh, I fixed the problem.

55
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,390
I was like, oh, my God, I finally fixed the problem.

56
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,190
I don't need it at 36 degrees.

57
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,910
Anyway, so, yeah, I was like, okay, I'm going to fix it.

58
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,570
I figured out why my apartment felt cold because I've been on cooling this entire time.

59
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,890
I had air conditioning on this entire time.

60
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,890
So, now, I'm okay now.

61
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,030
Now, everything is okay, chat.

62
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,750
Everything is all right.

63
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,910
So, I've been playing Deadlock on and off and like...

64
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:29,490
I was playing with my friends and like, apparently, now, I took a little break, but I went back to play Deadlock a little bit yesterday.

65
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:36,490
And apparently, now, there's no rank anymore.

66
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,910
So, you can get your rank by playing Quick Play.

67
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,830
So, I thought that was really funny because they were like, oh, what's your rank, Doki?

68
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,010
And I was like, oh, I don't know yet.

69
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,650
Like, I have to play one more game.

70
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,870
And after I play one more game, my rank was about the same rank as my friends.

71
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:02,590
And they were so mad and annoyed because they play so much more than me.

72
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,070
They're like, shut the fuck up, chat.

73
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,230
I was like, oh, hey, what's your rank?

74
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,070
Because I barely play the game.

75
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:17,030
And then, um, um, and then, their rank was a missionary or whatever.

76
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,290
Oh my god, emissary.

77
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,610
I don't fucking know.

78
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,550
And apparently, that's like plat slash diamond.

79
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:31,870
And then, my friends were like really tilted because I barely play the game.

80
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,990
And I'm in their elo.

81
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,930
So, I was like, yay, we're the same, guys.

82
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,510
And they're like, shut the fuck up.

83
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,710
Because they play like almost every day.

84
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,770
They play incredibly frequently.

85
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,770
And I'm there.

86
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,970
I just showed up.

87
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,650
I was like, oh, hey, isn't this the same rank as you guys?

88
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,330
But like, honestly, I think it's based off of your win percentage.

89
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,990
Because I play, I don't play ranked.

90
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,650
And I play with my friends.

91
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:11,030
So, like, I obviously don't perform the best, but my friends do.

92
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,070
And then, they're like, how the fuck are you the same rank as us?

93
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,230
You know what I mean?

94
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,890
Because like my stats, my stats are so bad.

95
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,870
They're so bad.

96
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
But I thought it was really funny.

97
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,900
I was like, hey guys, look at us.

98
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,300
We're the same.

99
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,420
We're the same, guys.

100
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,680
Apparently, it's like platter diamond in Deadlock, which is funny.

101
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,880
And Marvel Rivals is coming out next week.

102
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,540
I'm excited to play that next week.

103
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,600
That's really, that's really the life update.

104
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,460
That was like my way to stall Silent Hill 2.

105
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,200
Because we're gonna like, we're gonna fucking die before we finish this game.

106
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
You're all gonna get married.

107
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,140
You're gonna have kids.

108
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,600
Your kids are gonna have kids.

109
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,740
You're gonna be at the funeral.

110
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,820
And then, and then like, the last thing they play at your funeral is me still playing Silent Hill 2.

111
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,160
Like this is, when will we ever finish the game?

112
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,140
When will we ever finish Silent Hill 2?

113
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,940
I thought it'd be fast.

114
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,980
So that's why I decided to go with Silent Hill 2 instead of returning to Dad of War.

115
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,300
But like, I don't even, some people have already given up on Dad of War.

116
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,460
They're like, we'll never get to see Dad again.

117
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,060
We'll never get to see him again.

118
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,100
At least my children's children will see you finish Silent Hill.

119
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,220
Um, um, oh zero, thank you for the super chat.

120
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,100
Thank you, thank you.

121
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,020
I convinced my brother to be a dragon.

122
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,140
Also, Dad cult?

123
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,760
Where?

124
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,520
I shut it down.

125
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,720
Thank you for the super chat.

126
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,700
Thank you, thank you.

127
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
I shut it down.

128
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,300
There should be no other cult than my cult.

129
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,020
I mean, well, to be fair, I think it's better to stay a religion.

130
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,200
Because by being a religion, you get to have tax breaks.

131
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,660
So like, if anything, we should, you can technically register as a religion, as long as you have a place of worship.

132
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,240
So like, maybe eventually, I don't know, somebody will be...

133
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,340
I feel like someday, somebody is gonna make a fucking church for a VTuber.

134
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,340
And it'll be constituted as like, a religion.

135
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,500
Because you can get tax breaks for it.

136
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,200
Um, Nexi, thank you for the magenta super.

137
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,800
Thank you, thank you.

138
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,000
Um, let's see.

139
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,040
Oh my gosh, my thing, my donation thing crashed.

140
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,940
I had to reset it.

141
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,120
Uh, oh my god, wait, you disappeared.

142
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,440
Okay, um, Nexi, thank you for the magenta super.

143
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,520
Thank you, thank you.

144
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,640
Is this the fear of what being a parent feels like?

145
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,420
Why is my oshi like that?

146
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,620
I am like, um, you know like, a D, you know like, girlfriend experience?

147
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,240
I am like, raising a child experience.

148
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,820
Child experience.

149
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,980
Thank you for the magenta super.

150
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,320
Thank you, thank you.

151
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,460
Uh, Mike, thank you for super chatting so I can solve.

152
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,580
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

153
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,420
What will happen first, a heat death of the universe or Doki finishing Silent Hill?

154
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,400
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

155
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:43,880
Also, before I, yes, before I finish Silent, not finish, before I play Silent Hill, I'm gonna go, um, grab a cough drop real fast.

156
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,020
I'll be right back, guys.

157
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,060
Don't worry, you can hear me, I didn't mute.

158
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,660
What are you doing here?

159
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,400
I saw, I saw dad crawl out of the bathroom.

160
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,940
I think he was like, abusing the heated floors.

161
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,100
Um, I was like, what are you doing in the bathroom?

162
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,900
Anyway, Alan, thank you for the magenta super, thank you.

163
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,400
Hi Doki, today is my birthday and as a tradition, I have to send a birthday super chat.

164
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,160
I can't believe it's the fourth, fourth, fourth, fourth, fourth birthday with you.

165
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,060
And the drag, I'm like, slowly regressing, um, cause I know I'm playing Silent Hill 2.

166
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,940
But I hope there's even more in the future.

167
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,320
Thank you for everything you do for us, thank you for the magenta super, Alan, thank you, thank you.

168
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

169
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,780
Happy birthday dear Alan, happy birthday to you.

170
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,260
Yeah, happy birthday to many more!

171
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,220
Um, Skellum, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

172
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,900
Hey Doki, got your case last week, did a build so much power so I can run 1990's Sega Genesis.

173
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,320
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

174
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,720
And I can watch you.

175
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Alright, let's see.

176
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:18,120
Uh, expected to be short 14,000 doctors by 2030 with no solution.

177
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,160
Guys, this is what I have to go through.

178
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,840
Oh my god, oh my god, that sounds terrible.

179
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,940
Alan, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

180
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,020
DJ, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

181
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,780
I never agreed to a title more than this one.

182
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,120
Oh my god, alright, here we go guys.

183
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,880
Here we go, back to Silent Hill we go.

184
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,300
Today I woke up to like 15 work messages and then I'm, instead of answering them, I'm playing Silent Hill 2.

185
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,400
Sorry.

186
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,260
The people demand that I finish Silent Hill 2, no matter how long.

187
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,360
Alright, let me make sure what is the volume for this game.

188
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,240
Okay, 8.7, there we go.

189
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,820
Yes, it's lagging a little bit.

190
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,720
Oh, it'll tire itself out, there we go, okay.

191
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,740
Alright.

192
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,300
Oh my god, I know where Pastoki left us too, that's the worst part.

193
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,420
The worst part is like, I know where she left us to die.

194
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,000
She saw, she saw what, what was the future and then Jojo'd me.

195
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,680
She, she fucking Jojo'd me.

196
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,880
To be continued and I have to be the continue, that's so fucked up.

197
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,800
That's, that's so fucked up, I'm the to be continued part.

198
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,300
An actual, thank you for the, an actual, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

199
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,480
Haven't played the remake but I will not stand by the, the presence, it is the worst level.

200
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,400
It is one, no, the remake for this is the worst level.

201
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:28,740
It's, it's fucking terrible, like I'm, I'm dreading, I'm dreading it right now.

202
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,840
Here we go.

203
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,280
Oh my god.

204
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,780
No, you played the remake version, you would agree, you would agree this is the worst level.

205
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,390
Oh, I know they're here.

206
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,050
Hello?

207
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,270
Hello?

208
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,890
Oh.

209
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,670
Oh.

210
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,830
Oh, I hear him.

211
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,490
Hello?

212
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,470
Can you just come over now?

213
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,310
Oh, I know he's here.

214
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,310
Just go this way.

215
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
I'll just go this way.

216
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,280
Oh my god, there's so many miracles in Silent Hill.

217
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,380
What's this?

218
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,060
Oh, it's the medium weight, okay.

219
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,560
Look at all these wheelchairs.

220
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,500
Okay, you can't open doors.

221
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,120
They're legs, how would they open a door?

222
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,200
I'll just close it.

223
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,680
Oh my god, I'll just close the door.

224
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,280
Maybe they can't open it.

225
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,300
Maybe they can't.

226
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,900
Blackfire, thank you with a five, give the ships, thank you.

227
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,180
Oh, there he is.

228
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,020
Oh, do you think he's gonna open my door?

229
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,820
You're just a normal one.

230
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,160
Okay, thank god, okay, he's just a normal one.

231
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,640
He's not the one that spits out.

232
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,060
Oh, I don't have a lot of bullets now.

233
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,200
Is he dead?

234
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,480
I can't remember, I don't remember who I've killed.

235
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,420
I can't remember, it's been way too long.

236
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,980
Who have I killed?

237
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,180
Oh, there he is.

238
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,680
Oh, that's fucked, that's actually fucked.

239
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,560
I don't like that.

240
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,290
Oh, oh, oh.

241
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,690
Oh,

242
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,240
fuck, okay.

243
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,180
That's bad.

244
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,440
Guys, how do I heal?

245
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,900
I keep forgetting how to heal.

246
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,600
What's the point of the heal?

247
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,000
I need a doubt before things get worse.

248
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,680
Cause by god, I can, I felt, feel like things are gonna get...

249
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,040
Oh, there the legs are, there she goes.

250
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,600
Oh, there she goes too.

251
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,540
Oh, hey guys.

252
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,560
Oh.

253
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,760
It's 6-0, we're not in Cypher Elite anymore.

254
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,990
I hate this.

255
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,510
I hate this, I know she's here.

256
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,990
Slam!

257
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:56,950
Slam!

258
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,370
Slam!

259
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,130
Okay, it's V, okay.

260
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:03,570
V.

261
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,810
Oh, what the fuck?

262
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,490
Stop.

263
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,750
Stop.

264
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,230
In the name of love.

265
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,690
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

266
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,570
Okay, my pile.

267
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,070
That's fine, I'll take those.

268
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,870
I'll take the pile.

269
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,790
Okay, nice.

270
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:22,850
Alright.

271
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,570
Can I break this wall?

272
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,990
Okay, no I can't.

273
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,690
Alright, I just gotta be sure.

274
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,110
I feel like I'm missing a lot of equipment and stuff, but like, that's okay.

275
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,130
That's okay, I'm already going through it.

276
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,170
Oh, what the fuck?

277
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,070
Where'd you come from?

278
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,950
Oh shit, oh shit, are you fucking- Oh, I hate these guys.

279
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:45,710
Okay.

280
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,070
That's fine.

281
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,830
We're okay.

282
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:58,570
I'm not okay, but like, someone's gotta believe, because I know chat, you don't believe in me.

283
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:02,750
Okay.

284
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,790
Oh, thank god, more ammo.

285
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,240
Alright, ammo time.

286
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,640
Can we break this wall?

287
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,900
Break down the wall!

288
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,720
Oh, what's over there?

289
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,980
What's over here?

290
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,140
I don't remember how to look at my map!

291
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,680
Where's my map?

292
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,920
Okay.

293
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,360
Where am I?

294
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,740
Where the fuck am I?

295
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,320
Where am I?

296
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,180
Okay.

297
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,300
Oh my god, there she is.

298
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,470
She's coming for me.

299
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,730
There we go.

300
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,090
I'd rather just headshot her.

301
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,590
Like, she's- oh my god, I don't know what I'm gonna do when she gets close.

302
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,790
The closer she gets, the more power I lose.

303
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,370
Alright.

304
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,950
Let's go this way.

305
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,030
At least I got back some of the ammo I wasted earlier.

306
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,470
Same.

307
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,610
Okay, I didn't grab this.

308
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,640
What the fuck?

309
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,060
We're alive?

310
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,830
We're alive.

311
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,590
Oh, that's the guy I shot- WOAH!

312
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,970
What the fuck?!

313
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,250
That was ba- oh my god, they were gonna rob me!

314
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,670
They were gonna shank me in the corner!

315
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,530
Oh my god!

316
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,990
It was a setup this entire time!

317
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,770
They were ready to shank me in the fucking alleyway!

318
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,110
I knew it.

319
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,870
I'd never go back to London.

320
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,010
Oh, that's somebody.

321
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,810
Where?

322
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,710
They were gonna mug me.

323
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,630
Shank you with what?

324
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,030
They have no hands!

325
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,710
Maybe they have one really sharp leg.

326
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,890
You don't know that.

327
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,430
The remake doesn't- no, don't fucking say that.

328
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,010
I'm like actually so scared.

329
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,170
Like, I can only play this game like at two to three hours every time.

330
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,790
Because I'm so fucking anxious and scared.

331
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,030
Like, don't say that!

332
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,830
It's actually scary!

333
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,710
Oh, I knew it.

334
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,650
I fucking knew it, you fucking- oh, you parasite!

335
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,810
Oh, you fucking- you thought you could get away from me, you fucking spotty!

336
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,530
Alright, we're fine.

337
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,570
Okay, we might as well have got everything now.

338
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,830
Right?

339
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,330
Did we get everything?

340
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,670
Oh, we didn't open this.

341
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,170
Oh, thank god.

342
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,690
Now we have- guys, there's no way we can die.

343
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,150
We have seventeen?

344
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,210
Oh my god.

345
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:39,990
Okay, armory.

346
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,990
Oh, we have armory!

347
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,790
Where the fuck is the armory though?

348
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,480
There's no way we can die now.

349
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,880
We literally have like- what's this?

350
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,000
In the center of Silent Hill, the town's major tourist attraction.

351
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,280
There's no way.

352
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,480
We literally have seven more so stocked up in fucking meds.

353
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,640
An event containing no details of the ship's disappearance despite an extensive police search.

354
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,480
Not our secret fragment- oh, wait.

355
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,980
Oh shit, it's like- it's like a ghost ship.

356
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,560
The rest of the bottomless lake, their bony hands stretch out toward boats that pass overhead.

357
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,380
Perhaps they reach for their comrades.

358
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,560
Oh shit, ghost ship!

359
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,780
That movie freaked me out because I accidentally saw it on TV when I was really young.

360
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,380
And it was playing on TV when I was like, really incredibly young.

361
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,880
And it was playing that- that infamous scene.

362
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,500
The tripwire scene.

363
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,580
That scene fucked me up.

364
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,540
Not a good user, thank you for the super chat.

365
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,520
Thank you, thank you.

366
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,300
Everything will be alright, Doki.

367
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,580
In order to overcome your fears, you must- What if I don't believe in myself?

368
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,320
I just pretend believe.

369
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,420
I don't actually believe.

370
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,890
Where am I?

371
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,990
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

372
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,830
Thank you, thank you.

373
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,490
We will not perish and beat the- Oh, imagine.

374
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,070
Oh, this has to be the armory!

375
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,750
We get the rifle!

376
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,530
Oh my god, thank god.

377
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,030
Now I'll never use it until a boss fight.

378
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,110
We get the rifle.

379
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,330
Isn't it great?

380
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,750
We get to look at it.

381
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,570
We get to look at the rifle.

382
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,350
Guys, we might never beat it.

383
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,170
GTA 6 is gonna come out and we're still here playing Silent Hill 2.

384
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,450
Yeah, I do.

385
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,810
I should have ammo for this.

386
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,770
No, I should reload it, too.

387
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,730
I have nine bullets.

388
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,510
I have nine bullets.

389
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:48,610
Alright.

390
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,530
Did I reload my shotgun, too?

391
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,210
Okay, nice.

392
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,770
Oh, this is bad.

393
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,630
I've been wasting- I'm wasting too much.

394
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,950
I almost said light.

395
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,650
I'm wasting way too much ammo.

396
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,240
I hate this level.

397
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,160
I hate this level.

398
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,340
I hate this level so fucking much.

399
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,700
I hate this level.

400
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,080
I hate this- Oh, I hear- I HEAR- IT'S LIGHT!

401
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,000
IT'S LIGHT!

402
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,180
IT'S LIGHT TIME!

403
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,100
I hate you.

404
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,020
I hate you so much!

405
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,260
WHERE ARE YOU?

406
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,780
Oh my god, I'm fucking gonna step on you.

407
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,800
That's right.

408
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,940
For free.

409
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,740
Okay.

410
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,080
I'm just gonna juice up real fast.

411
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
I hate this level so much.

412
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,980
I hate it.

413
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,860
OH MY GOD!

414
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,500
DO THEY RESPAWN?

415
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,100
ARE THEY LAYING EGGS?

416
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,800
ARE THEY LAYING EGGS?

417
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,300
Like, what is this?

418
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,460
Guys, I need to know.

419
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,700
Do they respawn?

420
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,300
I actually need to know.

421
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,240
Like, am I wasting my fucking bullets right now?

422
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,240
Oh my god, I'm like, so fucking- WAIT, REALLY?

423
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,780
Are you serious?

424
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,890
They actually respawn.

425
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,920
Oh my god.

426
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,180
I don't remember where the wave thing is.

427
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,300
Where was it?

428
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,620
Was it here?

429
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,620
Oh, it's over here, okay.

430
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,560
Alright.

431
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,430
Okay, what if we put it all on here?

432
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,130
Okay, nevermind.

433
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:46,850
Doesn't matter.

434
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,950
Okay, nice.

435
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,510
We got the cow.

436
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,150
Where the fuck is the cow?

437
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,890
Where the fuck is the cow?

438
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,270
Oh my god, where's the cow?

439
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,090
The headless serpent.

440
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,650
The hornless ox.

441
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,710
Okay, that's the cow.

442
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,190
They respawn for the three step piece.

443
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,590
They stopped!

444
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,570
When do I know it's eventually?

445
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,970
When do I know it hits eventual levels?

446
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,650
Oh my god.

447
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,330
Oh, there he is.

448
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,910
It's like here.

449
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,900
God, oh my god.

450
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,460
Are you serious?

451
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,480
I can't just- I hate you.

452
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,080
Oh, I've never hated a fucking monster like you.

453
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,940
Oh, where are you?

454
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,140
Oh, there's several now!

455
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,960
I need to turn on the lights.

456
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,220
Oh my god!

457
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,880
They're repopulating!

458
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,980
They're actually repopulating!

459
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
Oh my god!

460
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,380
They're actually making more!

461
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,560
This is a session right there!

462
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,220
As you guys said, I have a lot of heals.

463
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,640
I don't know about that anymore.

464
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,120
I'm slowly losing more from just these guys.

465
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,160
Oh my god, they're actually repopulating.

466
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,240
They're making more.

467
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,360
Okay, we're going up top.

468
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,500
Oh, I can't calm down.

469
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,680
Oh, you're such a whore!

470
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,640
And you are!

471
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,020
The thing is, I know you're a whore.

472
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,060
Are you?

473
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,880
What are you?

474
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,640
Oh!

475
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,770
I'm not doing okay right now.

476
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,910
I am fucking- Oh!

477
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,550
Where am I?

478
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,050
Where am I?

479
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,950
I know- Oh my god, bro.

480
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,750
Guys, guys.

481
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,330
I had 17.

482
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,090
I had- She disappeared!

483
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,950
How did he disappear?

484
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,450
Why?

485
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,390
He actually disappeared!

486
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,250
Wait, where did he go?

487
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,600
Where did he- I shot him and he TP'd away!

488
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,330
Oh no.

489
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,940
I hate this.

490
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,820
I hate this so much.

491
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,600
Ah!

492
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,660
Oh my god!

493
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,310
They just- Oh my god!

494
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,670
Why?

495
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:34,190
I had so much meds before!

496
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,390
Bro!

497
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,890
These guys suck!

498
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,250
They suck so much!

499
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,430
Not in like a good way!

500
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,770
Oh my god.

501
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,710
I hate them.

502
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,010
I hate them.

503
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,750
No,

504
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,040
I do not sound like I'm having fun right now with these fuckers.

505
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,400
Oh my god.

506
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,000
I self-blocked D.

507
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,200
Where is self-block D?

508
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,640
Okay, it's over there.

509
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,520
Alright.

510
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,640
It's over there.

511
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,960
I need to find the key for self-block 4.

512
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,260
Destruction reported.

513
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,960
C-140 yelling about C-777 haunting him.

514
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,660
Claim bars can't hold him.

515
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:34,720
Okay.

516
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,340
Bathroom door is barred from inside.

517
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,120
Efforts made to get them open.

518
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,920
We don't hear anything from the other side.

519
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,040
Okay, that does not sound promising!

520
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm gonna use my bullets.

521
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
I don't care anymore.

522
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,240
I don't care.

523
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm not using my fucking hands anymore.

524
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,140
It's over.

525
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,120
No more hands.

526
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,620
I don't care.

527
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,120
I don't care about ammo.

528
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,100
These guys really, really suck.

529
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,540
I don't care anymore.

530
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,700
We're gonna use our hands.

531
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,180
Where does this go?

532
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
We're not gonna use our hands anymore.

533
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,740
We're gonna use our fucking...

534
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,760
Wait, where does this go?

535
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,300
Oh, that's for the boar.

536
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,920
We use our gun.

537
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,280
I wasted so many meds for this particular area.

538
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,920
For just this area, too.

539
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,820
That's the worst part.

540
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,860
Okay, we're not that crazy.

541
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,800
We're not gonna use our fucking...

542
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,180
Just in case he's gonna explode.

543
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,220
Spider lady?

544
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Spider lady?

545
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,200
Spider man?

546
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,720
Are you there?

547
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,200
Any spider ladies near me?

548
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,100
Any single spider ladies in my area?

549
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,540
Please.

550
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,040
Please don't do this to me.

551
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,020
Please just come to me.

552
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,380
I'm just so vulnerable.

553
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,240
Whoa!

554
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,360
Peak...

555
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:32,120
Peak eating material for your children.

556
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,500
Oh, okay.

557
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,020
Okay, what's this?

558
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,100
The shiv key?

559
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,180
The fuck am I gonna do with a shiv key?

560
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,260
Shame you didn't find it.

561
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,300
Shouldn't you know this place better than I do?

562
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Now it's too late.

563
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,100
I'm going for a walk.

564
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,460
Find what?

565
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
I'm just...

566
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,280
My mission isn't to find anything.

567
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,680
I'm just trying to survive.

568
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,820
What am I even trying to find anymore?

569
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
What do I do with a shiv key?

570
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,140
Guys, what do I do?

571
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,320
What is a shiv key?

572
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,180
Okay.

573
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,380
Hello?

574
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
I knew it.

575
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,460
I knew you were...

576
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,200
Oh, you're just gonna crawl up, you fucker.

577
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,620
You just...

578
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,700
Oh, just cause you can just walk?

579
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,540
Oh my god, I hate you!

580
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,600
I hate you!

581
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,080
I hate you so much!

582
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,560
He actually jumped down from above!

583
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,200
Oh, just to fuck with me.

584
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,100
And it worked.

585
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,440
And it fucking worked.

586
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,080
Oh my god, saw someone walking past lights out again.

587
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,700
Which one of everyone that you... of you that was do I need to remind you that you must never leave your post without...

588
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,600
Oh my god, I knew it.

589
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,620
I fucking... I heard you.

590
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,020
I... Oh, I knew it!

591
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,580
I fucking...

592
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,820
Yes, okay, back to read.

593
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,900
Well, guess we'll never know what happens in that note.

594
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,780
I heard that.

595
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,660
I heard him.

596
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,740
I fucking...

597
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,460
I knew you were gonna come back.

598
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,760
I knew it.

599
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,930
What the fuck is he doing?

600
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,350
Oh, I see you!

601
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,790
I fucking see you!

602
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,320
Oh...

603
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,040
I see him right over there.

604
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,100
Oh, come on.

605
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,120
How much ammo do I have left on my hand?

606
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,420
Okay, it's doable.

607
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,060
It's doable.

608
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,680
He's up there!

609
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,240
He's like up there!

610
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,120
I see him!

611
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,100
Maybe he'll come back down because he'll think it's night time.

612
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,320
Is he in the cup?

613
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,820
He's not.

614
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,440
He's just gonna stay up there like the little bitch he is.

615
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,360
What the fuck?

616
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,720
That's fucking right.

617
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,120
I would shoot a spider.

618
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,260
I would 100% shoot a spider.

619
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,160
Alright.

620
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,760
We got this area.

621
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:04,700
Okay.

622
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,440
Now we're here.

623
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,280
Oh, he's coming.

624
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,120
I know he is.

625
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,260
The bars, the walls.

626
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,140
They can't hold him.

627
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,760
He'll get in!

628
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,340
He'll get in!

629
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,900
I still have time.

630
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,200
I can make it almost through.

631
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,040
But he's close.

632
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,780
I can feel it.

633
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,000
He's coming to finish it.

634
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,560
What the fuck is wrong with him?

635
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,960
Oh no, he's going to schizo.

636
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,520
Oh, just like me.

637
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,940
And these walls.

638
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,380
These fucking walls.

639
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,840
I hear him.

640
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,260
I hear them.

641
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,720
Oh my god, the spiders.

642
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,380
I hear them.

643
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,840
The spiders are gonna come here and give me a voice.

644
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,200
Okay, I gotta smash these guys just in case.

645
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,420
I'm so paranoid.

646
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,160
Are they in the bathroom?

647
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,480
I knew it.

648
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,960
I was like, excuse me.

649
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,220
I was using that.

650
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,180
I'm sorry, ma'am.

651
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,140
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

652
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,700
What?

653
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,720
Where did you come from?

654
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,680
Oh shit.

655
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,240
Oh, I'm in the stupid quarters.

656
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,670
Oh, thank god.

657
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,600
Oh my god, I wish it was just nurses.

658
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,320
I miss the nurses, not gonna lie.

659
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,420
Bring them back.

660
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,020
Bring the nurses back.

661
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,820
The nurses were easier.

662
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,380
The nurses were 100% easier than this hellhole I'm in right now.

663
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,240
They won't save you.

664
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,440
Please, I'm just a little guy.

665
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,440
I didn't just...

666
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,530
Oh, nurses are so much easier and nicer to me.

667
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,470
Nurses are so nice to me, guys.

668
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,490
I miss that.

669
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,270
I've never used so many meds as now.

670
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:30,060
I've been like really good with my med situation and now I think I'm gonna overdose on it.

671
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,620
I told you, I told you.

672
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,520
They don't listen.

673
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,340
What the fuck?

674
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,760
Okay.

675
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,940
What the fuck?

676
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,760
Nice.

677
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,480
Alright.

678
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:46,900
Okay.

679
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,220
More ammo.

680
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,080
We need it.

681
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,590
What's that sound?

682
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,690
Wait, what's that sound?

683
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,910
Why was there banging?

684
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:04,850
What?

685
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,520
Hello?

686
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,460
I'm gonna wait until...

687
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,300
Hello?

688
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,360
What's that sound?

689
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,420
I...

690
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,100
I don't know what that sound was.

691
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,660
And my light is almost gone.

692
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,420
I have to wait until...

693
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,220
Hello?

694
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,180
Knock-knock?

695
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,900
Knock-knock?

696
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,660
Oh...

697
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,080
Please...

698
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,960
I just wanna leave Silent Hill.

699
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,440
I don't care about my dead wife anyway.

700
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,840
I don't care about her anymore.

701
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,640
It wasn't that.

702
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,880
It wasn't that good enough for me to die in this town.

703
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,570
Oh, I don't like this.

704
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,470
There's dead things already here.

705
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,250
Why are there dead bodies everywhere?

706
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,930
Is he here?

707
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:37,950
Is he here?

708
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,090
Why are there dead bodies everywhere?

709
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,530
Oh, I don't like that.

710
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,550
I think he's here.

711
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,610
I think cooler me is here.

712
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,070
The cooler version of me.

713
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,530
The guy I wish I was.

714
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,170
The guy she told you not to worry about.

715
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,200
I think it's him.

716
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,220
Oh, it's giving me so much ammo.

717
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,560
That's never a good sign.

718
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,230
Oh, this is never a good sign.

719
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,830
Guys, is he killable?

720
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,910
Is he gonna show up?

721
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:27,990
And is he killable?

722
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,410
Is he killable?

723
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,890
Or is it...

724
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,930
Okay.

725
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:41,690
Okay.

726
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,910
I swear if I try to kill him and you're like why are you wasting ammo, dude?

727
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,130
I swear to god, I'm not.

728
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,390
I'm not okay.

729
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,440
Okay, it's time to stick your hand in the wall.

730
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,800
Stick your hand in the wall.

731
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,600
James, it's time.

732
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,900
It's your favorite time of the year.

733
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,400
It's okay, it's like a little massage with the little bugs with us.

734
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,260
Oh, here he is.

735
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,860
Oh, here he is.

736
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:34,670
Wait, what?

737
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,450
Wait, what?

738
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,810
Wait, what?

739
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,150
What?!

740
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:46,830
Wait, what?!

741
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,960
Okay.

742
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,060
Wait a minute.

743
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,520
Wait a minute.

744
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,740
Okay, we're just gonna get these guys out of the way.

745
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,760
Oh, so like we're fine.

746
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,500
Oh, we are not fine!

747
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,580
Okay, nevermind.

748
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:20,960
Will he crawl over?

749
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,420
Oh, shit!

750
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,220
Guys!

751
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,980
Guys, one at a fucking time!

752
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh, shit!

753
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,580
Not the women!

754
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,380
There's too many!

755
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,620
Oh, shit!

756
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,680
There's too many!

757
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,220
Too many women!

758
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,040
Oh, god.

759
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,140
Oh, god, please don't explode on me.

760
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,080
Too many women.

761
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,820
Guys, I can't handle there's too many!

762
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,560
One isn't more than enough!

763
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,520
Monogamy!

764
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,780
Let's go!

765
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:14,820
Okay.

766
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,120
Just in case.

767
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,680
Okay.

768
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,000
Oh!

769
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,220
Alright, we're fine.

770
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,480
Okay, we're okay.

771
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,700
We're not okay.

772
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,920
Oh, we're not okay.

773
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,700
Okay.

774
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,340
Don't have a lot of ammo left!

775
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,370
Hello?

776
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:52,890
Hello?

777
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,170
Alright.

778
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,470
Too many women!

779
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,810
It's a skill issue.

780
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,330
Okay, this way.

781
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,990
I thought that was something else.

782
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,960
How do I get back down?

783
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,660
I don't remember.

784
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,280
Oh, there was another thing I can open over here.

785
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,120
I remember now.

786
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,070
Should be another gate.

787
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:33,910
Oh, there it is.

788
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,210
Wait, what?

789
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:41,930
Oh!

790
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:42,690
There we go.

791
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,750
I make my own holes!

792
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,370
That's right!

793
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:50,610
Okay.

794
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,350
Oh my god, thank you.

795
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,410
Please, I need ammo.

796
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:56,890
I don't need this.

797
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:57,990
I need ammo.

798
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,670
Can I open this now?

799
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,470
Okay, I can't.

800
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:00,790
Okay.

801
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,130
That's fine.

802
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,890
We're not doing too well, though.

803
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:12,050
We are- We're not doing- We're running out of ammo!

804
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,470
We're running out of very- I've used so many on the spiders!

805
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:23,070
I've saved so many, but I've also used so many on just the spiders alone.

806
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,090
You don't understand.

807
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,550
You don't understand the pain of my existence right now.

808
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,590
Okay.

809
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:38,650
Save.

810
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,170
Alright.

811
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,270
We're okay.

812
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,010
We're okay.

813
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,850
Robo, thank you for the super chat!

814
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:49,190
Thank you!

815
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,410
This is my very first super chat to you, Doki!

816
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:58,530
I'm also glad I'm watching a streamer who remembers to reload before fights.

817
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,030
It depends.

818
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,690
I'm- I'm very scared, so I'm always reloading.

819
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,580
Okay.

820
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,080
If I put it here...

821
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,060
No?

822
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,280
You mean this?

823
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,850
Oh, that's way too heavy.

824
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,230
Maybe I can open the boar room now, though.

825
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,560
Yay!

826
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,760
Okay, we can open the boar room.

827
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,500
Alright.

828
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,120
No, it doesn't waste ammo.

829
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,260
It's not that realistic.

830
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,340
Thank God.

831
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,000
Thank fucking God.

832
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,500
Okay.

833
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,920
Back to hell I go.

834
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,640
Alright, where's the boar head?

835
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,720
We're in this ox.

836
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,200
Wait, did I not finish the- Oh no, it doesn't tell you when you finish a room.

837
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:18,680
It like crosses it out, but it doesn't, so like, I just have to remember if I've been there or not.

838
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,380
Okay, so I got the boar now.

839
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,480
Two more.

840
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,420
Two more left of the hell.

841
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,680
Okay, the boar is this way.

842
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,460
Oh, maybe I'll finally leave the jail.

843
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,040
Maybe I'll finally leave this God-forsaken world.

844
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:46,980
Okay.

845
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,640
Nope, I have to go straight.

846
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,500
Alright, let's go straight.

847
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,180
Let's go!

848
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,340
Oop, I hear something to my right!

849
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,940
Wonder what that could be.

850
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,580
Oh, it's not the spider, that's fine.

851
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,300
It's just that guy.

852
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,560
Um, no, I feel like he's gonna spit on me, so I'm just gonna...

853
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:18,310
Okay, I know I'm not supposed to waste ammo, but I really don't want to kill him, so you don't understand!

854
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,710
Incident at the infirmary.

855
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,530
Assaulted medical staff attempted to steal medication.

856
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:26,410
Rumors of disease spreading among the prisoners.

857
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,830
Guys, all I'm saying is- whoa!

858
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:34,330
Okay, anyway, guys, all I'm saying is that we are in a prison.

859
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,770
Where are the ammo from the prison guards?

860
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,910
I know they should be packing right about now.

861
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,910
Prison guards, where did you- Whoa!

862
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,890
Oh my god, that's- I saw it too!

863
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,150
I saw her!

864
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,410
I knew she was there!

865
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,380
Oh, I saw her too.

866
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,000
Why did you keep your ammo in the library?

867
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,060
What are you gonna do, shoot the books?

868
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,750
Oh, Always prepared.

869
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:24,470
Okay.

870
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,200
What shortcut is this?

871
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,340
Oh, it's this shortcut, okay.

872
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,960
Knowledge is power, Doki.

873
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,020
Oh my god, nine bullets in a dream.

874
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,780
I remember when I used to have 40 bullets.

875
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,120
This area does not give you any ammo!

876
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,820
That's so fucked.

877
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,660
If anybody prisons should be worried, they'd give me the most ammo.

878
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,270
So fucked.

879
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,850
I think this level is the one that's like actually messed me up the most.

880
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:11,650
It was smooth sailing in all the other levels, it was such smooth sailing.

881
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:17,390
Like, I was not doing as bad as the other ones.

882
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,120
Oh, there you are.

883
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,810
Oh, what?

884
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,110
How the

885
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,610
- Like, what, you poked me and I died?

886
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:55,490
Like, like, I'm sorry.

887
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:59,150
You fucking poked my fucking ass apparently.

888
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,010
Can I read any of this?

889
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:04,590
Oh, guards think we're lepers now.

890
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,510
Don't know why, but they stay away.

891
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,790
I don't complain.

892
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,590
That was not fair.

893
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,910
That was actually not fair.

894
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,180
Oh, thank god.

895
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,960
That's what I needed.

896
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,080
I have six bullets.

897
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,220
I'm not gonna use my shotgun.

898
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,520
Okay, that's a bug.

899
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,040
Oh my god, okay.

900
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,120
Okay.

901
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:50,720
Okay.

902
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,360
Alright.

903
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,320
Oh, there's a nurse right here.

904
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,860
Initial- Where did she go?

905
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,900
Is she gonna walk all the way from here?

906
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,880
She didn't even see me.

907
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,580
Where's she gonna walk to?

908
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,180
Oh, what the fuck?

909
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,380
You didn't even know I was here!

910
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,080
No, oh no.

911
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,160
Oh no, I'm sorry.

912
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,000
Oh wait, oh no, there's a- this is it.

913
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,800
I have 33!

914
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,680
Guys, I have 33 shotgun bullets.

915
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,720
Oh my god.

916
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,320
Is this gonna be the shot that ends Silent Hill?

917
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,700
Thank you for the super chat paladins.

918
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,840
Thank you.

919
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,120
Why the fuck do I have 33 shotguns?

920
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,180
Where is my handgun ammo?

921
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,540
I don't need more meds, please.

922
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,820
I don't need more.

923
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,800
Doctor, please.

924
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,620
If you keep giving me more meds, I'm gonna fucking die.

925
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,300
What?

926
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,040
What?

927
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,340
What?

928
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,530
What the fuck?

929
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:34,790
Who was that?

930
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:39,510
Hello?

931
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:43,330
Hello?

932
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:49,150
Who was that?

933
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,070
Oh, save point.

934
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,170
I'm okay now.

935
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,770
Yeah, that that did not sound safe.

936
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:03,390
That, I feel like I- aww.

937
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,370
That did not feel safe.

938
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,230
It does not give me joy.

939
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,150
Hello?

940
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:17,250
Hello?

941
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,390
Oh, fuck.

942
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:21,690
Okay.

943
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,010
Alright, there's TV.

944
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:27,550
Break time!

945
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:29,510
Break time?

946
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,990
Is it break hours?

947
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:34,830
Please.

948
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:36,050
Oh, thank god.

949
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,290
Two more handgun ammo.

950
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,350
Not all is lost.

951
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:40,130
Light up!

952
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,270
Welcome to Tomato Farm.

953
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,110
Welcome, welcome.

954
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,890
Emergency medical examination report.

955
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,890
Report conclusions are incorrect.

956
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,650
The prisoners are sick.

957
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:52,470
Examinations are to be repeated until their condition is properly diagnosed.

958
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,670
Use more invasive methods?

959
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:59,130
Bro, just tell them to spin on something and then see what it is.

960
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,960
What do you mean invasive?

961
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,060
What does that mean?

962
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:11,680
Hello?

963
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,120
Is there any loot?

964
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,000
Oh, thank god.

965
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,840
It's on TV.

966
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:19,800
Oh.

967
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,400
Now no one can be entertained.

968
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:31,680
Napo!

969
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,740
Thank you for the super chat!

970
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,100
Thank you, thank you!

971
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,080
Oh god, okay.

972
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,120
Oh, it's your very first super chat!

973
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,060
Thank you for your very first super chat, too!

974
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,220
Thank you, thank you!

975
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,100
What's this?

976
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,200
Oh, it's from the first Silent Hill, too.

977
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,680
Stand proud, Doki.

978
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,420
You're strong.

979
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,560
I'm happy to give you my first super.

980
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,600
Oh my god.

981
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,620
Thank you again for the super chat.

982
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,480
Thank you.

983
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,810
This is where I was.

984
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,230
Sorry, my voice cracked.

985
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:12,970
I was going through puberty.

986
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,810
You know those moments when you're like...

987
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,620
When you're going through puberty and your voice starts cracking?

988
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,640
It's one of those days.

989
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,850
Okay, you each get like one...

990
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:38,570
Three shots.

991
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,810
If you don't die by the third shot, I start...

992
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,870
I start crawling.

993
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,610
I start swinging.

994
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:47,570
Thank you.

995
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,270
That's the third puberty this week.

996
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:53,370
Puberty is a long-term thing.

997
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,150
Puberty doesn't just stop.

998
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,700
That's what I'm saying.

999
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,840
Immediate disciplinary actions.

1000
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,400
Where the fuck is my ammo?

1001
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,760
Where did my ammo go?

1002
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,370
Alright.

1003
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:27,670
One.

1004
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:31,150
Two.

1005
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:32,630
Three.

1006
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:33,530
Swing.

1007
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,310
Swing.

1008
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:36,390
Swing.

1009
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,150
Oh shit.

1010
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,890
Oh, I'm sorry.

1011
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,810
I am so sorry.

1012
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,090
She's a shanker.

1013
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:51,050
Like, why does she take three shots?

1014
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,730
Okay, the shanker's gone.

1015
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,350
Oh my god.

1016
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,930
I'm reminded of London every time I see her.

1017
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:07,990
Alright.

1018
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,650
Off we go.

1019
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,050
Oh, they're finally giving me more ammo.

1020
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:17,370
More handgun ammo.

1021
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:17,450
Oh.

1022
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:20,930
That's good.

1023
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,170
We got the upper floor key.

1024
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,090
Where was that for?

1025
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:28,210
Where

1026
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:52,260
was that for?

1027
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,360
They should just let all the prisoners go.

1028
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,360
That's what they did.

1029
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:57,720
During COVID.

1030
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,420
Isn't that what they did during COVID?

1031
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,820
They were like, you're all free now.

1032
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,620
To be fair, that's like, really fucked up.

1033
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,070
But like...

1034
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,200
Yeah!

1035
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,620
I remember reading about that.

1036
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,900
Didn't they, like, when COVID happened?

1037
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,880
Not all of them, but like, some were released from jail.

1038
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,000
Cause they were like, oh yeah, like, it's too cramped.

1039
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:22,970
I'm pretty sure...

1040
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,540
What country?

1041
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,900
Think what country that would happen to.

1042
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,980
I remember reading an article about that.

1043
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:43,200
Because like, it was basically like, they were scared of COVID, so they like, released some of the inmates that were not like, jailed for like, really bad reasons.

1044
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:52,650
Yeah, for like, minor crime.

1045
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,390
Definitely not in America.

1046
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:07,010
And then like, for years, some of them were apparently like, lepers or whatever, just released.

1047
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:12,880
No!

1048
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,240
Canada, moment!

1049
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,720
Guys, it was not Canada.

1050
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,540
Guys, I hate it to break it to you guys.

1051
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,620
It's somewhere in NA, and it was not Canada.

1052
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,360
Isn't that fucking crazy?

1053
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,700
They're like, you're free now.

1054
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:57,250
Whoa!

1055
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:59,290
Where were you heading?

1056
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:00,710
Making my way downtown.

1057
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:02,270
Whoa!

1058
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,950
Where were you heading, ma'am?

1059
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,590
You're walking fast.

1060
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,630
Why were you walking so fast?

1061
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:13,710
Holy shit.

1062
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:14,670
What the fuck?

1063
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,180
Where am I?

1064
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,940
I don't wanna deal with that.

1065
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,140
I don't wanna deal with that.

1066
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,260
I'm gonna go back upstairs.

1067
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,320
Is that a doctor?

1068
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,220
Thank you for the super chat.

1069
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,140
Thank you.

1070
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,460
Check my corners, left and right, before you cross the street.

1071
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,260
And you might get ammo on the way.

1072
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,460
Oh, fucking hell.

1073
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,010
Oh.

1074
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:11,250
Oh.

1075
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:11,350
Okay.

1076
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:15,510
Oh, shit.

1077
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:19,290
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.

1078
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:22,630
Sick.

1079
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:24,790
Oh, shit.

1080
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:27,590
I did it.

1081
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:28,810
I spelled sick.

1082
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,610
I was definitely typing that.

1083
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,610
Easiest puzzle of my life.

1084
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,390
What an easy puzzle.

1085
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,830
Guys, I didn't realize A is S, guys.

1086
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,520
Paul, welcome to Tomato Farm.

1087
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,420
Welcome, welcome.

1088
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,360
How the fuck do we get to the other side?

1089
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,760
There was a spider on the other side.

1090
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,640
Is there a wall I can break?

1091
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,020
There was a spider on the other side.

1092
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,300
Oh, he was outside.

1093
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,840
Oh, fuck.

1094
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,280
Burrito, thank you for the super chat.

1095
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,180
Thank you, thank you.

1096
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:28,140
In some places, they made it so no one got bailed.

1097
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,000
So people were booked and let go immediately.

1098
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,420
That does not sound very...

1099
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,620
Then why get arrested?

1100
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,340
I guess you get...

1101
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,560
I guess you're put on the record?

1102
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,280
Because I'm like thinking, what's the point?

1103
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,340
You might as well not arrest people at that point.

1104
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,200
I hear him.

1105
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:53,740
He's outside.

1106
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,060
Oh, never mind.

1107
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,000
He wants to come in.

1108
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:56,700
Okay, alright.

1109
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:00,840
Get down.

1110
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,720
Oh, true quotes.

1111
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,580
I heard about that.

1112
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:04,820
Yeah.

1113
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,960
Get over here.

1114
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,310
Oh, that's the worst.

1115
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:15,270
You're the worst.

1116
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,250
You're actually the worst.

1117
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,430
I know you're upset.

1118
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,650
I know you crawled all the way up there.

1119
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:25,510
I know you're up there too.

1120
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,250
That's...

1121
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,490
Oh, I fucking hate you.

1122
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,650
This is the worst part.

1123
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:33,450
I know he's up there.

1124
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,200
I can't go through this door.

1125
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,420
Wait, then what's the point of having a shortcut here?

1126
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,340
Where's the other exit?

1127
01:07:58,540 --> 01:07:59,440
I don't remember.

1128
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,270
Is it like here?

1129
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,440
Changing room.

1130
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,120
Shower.

1131
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,400
Guards room.

1132
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,320
Which way is the other exit?

1133
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,210
Here?

1134
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,430
Oh, that's the other safe point.

1135
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,220
There was another exit here.

1136
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:39,550
I fucking knew it.

1137
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,270
Oh, why are you running away?

1138
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:42,990
It's because I killed your brothers and sisters?

1139
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,290
That's right!

1140
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,870
Fuck you!

1141
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:50,980
Alright, alright.

1142
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,300
We got this guy out of the way.

1143
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:57,880
There's more!

1144
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:03,570
I hate them.

1145
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:06,650
I hate them so much.

1146
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:11,070
What was the point of going here?

1147
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:14,590
Like, how do I leave?

1148
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:22,110
How the fuck do I leave?

1149
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,630
Get out of here!

1150
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:26,350
There's...

1151
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:27,290
I'm getting out of here.

1152
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:28,450
I'm going back this way.

1153
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,490
I'm going back this way.

1154
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:34,250
Fuck this.

1155
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,770
I'm going to go the long way.

1156
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:41,490
You can't do that, dude.

1157
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:42,590
It feels like Ikea.

1158
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:46,730
It actually feels like Ikea right now.

1159
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:49,390
I'm trying to figure out how to get out of here.

1160
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:53,290
I guess...

1161
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,430
Block D?

1162
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:57,550
Is Block D a way to get out?

1163
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:00,230
Block D.

1164
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,210
I...

1165
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:04,930
Where?

1166
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,830
How did you...

1167
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:08,410
Where?

1168
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:11,530
Where do you keep making babies?

1169
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,050
Okay.

1170
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,690
Okay, we're going to go through Block D.

1171
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,940
I stood still for one second.

1172
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,280
One goddamn second.

1173
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,110
Oh my god.

1174
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:36,970
The fucking spider gangbang that's repopulating the population.

1175
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,130
I have to stop it.

1176
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:42,450
Oh my god, we figured it out.

1177
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:43,830
We finally figured it out.

1178
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,750
I hear so many of them outside right now.

1179
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,270
Repopulating as I speak.

1180
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:57,870
I fucking knew it.

1181
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:01,530
I fucking knew it.

1182
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,150
I don't care if I used up...

1183
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,030
I don't care.

1184
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:06,890
I don't care.

1185
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:10,770
I have four bullets.

1186
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,850
I'm instating a ban.

1187
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,190
It's time.

1188
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,700
No more woohoo.

1189
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,160
We gotta control this population.

1190
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,940
Okay, and then the dove is the last one.

1191
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:38,760
Okay.

1192
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,780
Woohoo, time is over.

1193
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,380
They have nothing to do anymore.

1194
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,900
They have nothing to do.

1195
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:52,500
Doki.

1196
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,960
Doki, how could you say that?

1197
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,920
What else do they have?

1198
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,700
This is funny.

1199
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,820
Oh no, I see him too.

1200
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:14,980
You think I don't see you?

1201
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,520
Just like...

1202
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,360
That's my woohoo partner for the night.

1203
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,560
How dare you.

1204
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,220
We're gonna woohoo tonight.

1205
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:37,880
Please at least let me look at the fucking map first before you get it down.

1206
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:46,520
If I have no fun here, nobody can have fun in this town.

1207
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,880
Wait, what?

1208
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,160
Oh shit.

1209
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,020
Now I'm in horny jail.

1210
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,020
Oh no.

1211
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,300
Oh no, they're trapped and there was them.

1212
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,160
Oh no.

1213
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,900
Why meds?

1214
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,740
Why can't you just give the prisoner ammo?

1215
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,400
I'm trapped in there with them guys.

1216
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,240
Oh no, what do I do?

1217
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,960
What do I do?

1218
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,460
I'm trapped in there with the fucking freaks.

1219
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,060
Freaks.

1220
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,640
Woman in flight.

1221
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,740
Oh, that's beautiful.

1222
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,280
436 people on a reciter.

1223
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,280
That's beautiful.

1224
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:47,620
Burning man.

1225
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,220
Oh, that is not as beautiful.

1226
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:55,890
Things were very cheery and then he...

1227
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,690
And then he burned everything down.

1228
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,700
I saw him run through.

1229
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,800
My one bullet to make it count.

1230
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,540
I mean, it sort of counted.

1231
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,440
Like, I think I hit him.

1232
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:28,720
What?

1233
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,920
Where did you go?

1234
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,800
I can't see!

1235
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,820
Oh my god.

1236
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,130
The fuck is this room?

1237
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:44,110
Like, what do you...

1238
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:46,190
Oh, I guess this is the padded rooms.

1239
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:48,430
But, like...

1240
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:49,570
Not padded.

1241
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:56,960
Can I open these?

1242
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:57,880
Oh, I can.

1243
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,200
Lord Kuros is singing in the super chat.

1244
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,040
Thank you, thank you.

1245
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,380
Do you want prison rice?

1246
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,740
Because I'm pretty sure this is how you get prison rice.

1247
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,580
I mean, they're already beating me up.

1248
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,900
What worse can they do now?

1249
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,760
Just a small town girl.

1250
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,260
Living in a lonely world.

1251
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:30,740
What was your purpose?

1252
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,640
Why?

1253
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:33,940
Why?

1254
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,540
Why were you...

1255
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:37,000
Okay.

1256
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:40,180
Alright.

1257
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,200
That's fine.

1258
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,020
That's fine.

1259
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,980
I don't know why he just walked over.

1260
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,100
But that's okay.

1261
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:54,630
He just casually scrolled past me.

1262
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,940
She was just having her morning jog.

1263
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,840
Why'd you do that?

1264
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,160
That's fucked up, Doki.

1265
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,000
She just...

1266
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,000
It's just a normal jog.

1267
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,950
Can I go up?

1268
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:25,510
Alright.

1269
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:27,410
How the fuck would I be upstairs?

1270
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:29,790
What's the shortcut?

1271
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,250
What's the shortcut?

1272
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:38,910
Oh my god.

1273
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:39,850
It's back here.

1274
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,770
It's here.

1275
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,810
Oh my god.

1276
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:48,590
It's here.

1277
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,610
I'm fucking...

1278
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:50,210
I'm leaving.

1279
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:55,290
This is where they repopulate.

1280
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,400
This is the repopulation zone.

1281
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,120
Okay.

1282
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:20,920
Alright.

1283
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,140
That's fine.

1284
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,720
That's fine.

1285
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,540
Where did this guy come from?

1286
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:40,510
Please call it anything else.

1287
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,880
The woohoo chamber.

1288
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:55,080
Thank you, Entire, for the wonderful name suggestion.

1289
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,020
Woohoo!

1290
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,140
Okay.

1291
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,540
I have no more light ammo.

1292
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,310
Can I open this?

1293
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:19,490
Oh my god.

1294
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,370
Why is it always meds?

1295
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:26,290
Does it not see the zero bullets in my inventory?

1296
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:26,830
Tori!

1297
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:38,250
Alright.

1298
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:41,890
Okay.

1299
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:44,330
Here we go.

1300
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,190
Get down!

1301
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,490
Get down!

1302
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:54,490
Sims can no longer woohoo with pyramid head.

1303
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,890
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1304
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:58,150
Thank you, thank you.

1305
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,130
I got it.

1306
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:04,310
No, I can't shoot anymore.

1307
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:07,830
I have to fucking brawl it out.

1308
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,150
They took away my ammo.

1309
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:16,550
I have 42 fucking shotgun bullets.

1310
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:21,150
What the fuck?

1311
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:23,150
There were two over there?

1312
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:26,110
How is there two?

1313
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:26,970
Oh!

1314
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:29,650
Alright.

1315
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:30,810
That's fine.

1316
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,420
Open this.

1317
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:39,720
Nice.

1318
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:42,660
Nothing.

1319
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:43,960
Nothing.

1320
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:45,660
Just books.

1321
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,020
Oh, sweet, wonderful books.

1322
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,060
That's what I needed.

1323
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,860
JL, thank you for the super chat.

1324
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,900
Thank you, thank you.

1325
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,160
Bro said woohoo chamber.

1326
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,360
All I heard was the other chamber.

1327
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1328
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,040
Thank you, thank you.

1329
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,700
Oh, coward.

1330
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:00,420
Oh, no.

1331
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,940
Still more shotgun.

1332
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:13,220
Okay.

1333
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,440
F6 is over there.

1334
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:21,820
Okay.

1335
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,900
Alright, how many monsters am I gonna unleash by pressing this button?

1336
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,660
Time to find out.

1337
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,060
Might as well do F5 as well.

1338
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:38,680
Okay.

1339
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:51,650
F5.

1340
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:07,190
Okay, F6 time.

1341
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,080
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1342
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,720
I couldn't let them take you and now you're...

1343
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,400
you're still there, aren't you?

1344
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,140
Oh, no.

1345
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:21,320
Oh.

1346
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,560
Okay, we got the last wave.

1347
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:28,320
Oh.

1348
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:32,820
Oh.

1349
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:37,450
Oh.

1350
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,530
Oh.

1351
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:42,890
Oh.

1352
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:48,770
Hello?

1353
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:52,740
Hello?

1354
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:09,850
Hello?

1355
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:10,610
I need a second.

1356
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:10,670
I need a second.

1357
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:18,950
Because I don't think they're happy about the woohoo band, guys.

1358
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:19,470
I don't.

1359
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:21,110
I don't.

1360
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,180
I don't think they're happy about the woohoo band, guys.

1361
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,480
I think they're...

1362
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,400
I think they're really mad.

1363
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,020
I think...

1364
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:39,860
I think they're...

1365
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,680
Oh.

1366
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,980
Oh, you can run out of ammo in this game?

1367
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:52,080
I was found the game too much, I had almost 200 pistol ammo at that point.

1368
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:53,860
As I think...

1369
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:58,240
I think they're really mad about the band.

1370
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,920
Guys, I don't wanna leave.

1371
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:14,760
Hello?

1372
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:26,680
Oh.

1373
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,300
Oh.

1374
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,660
Oh.

1375
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,910
Guys, I...

1376
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,050
I'm not happy.

1377
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:38,810
I'm back.

1378
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:49,190
Oh, Batark, thank you for the superchat.

1379
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:50,390
Thank you, thank you.

1380
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:53,270
Oh, my God.

1381
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,190
I'm sorry.

1382
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:57,510
You have to understand.

1383
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:58,430
I...

1384
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:03,030
Guys, it hurts me as well, guys.

1385
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:07,110
You know, I don't wanna take away your joy.

1386
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,790
You guys know that, right?

1387
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:10,710
Oh, no.

1388
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:12,790
I can't light things up anymore.

1389
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:14,810
What?

1390
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,070
What?

1391
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:19,530
Oh, my God.

1392
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:21,430
Okay, I was like, why is it moving away?

1393
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,530
Okay.

1394
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:29,220
Oh.

1395
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:36,500
Guys, guys, I didn't wanna take away your joy, but my hands were tied.

1396
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,820
Guys, you know that, right?

1397
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,340
My hands were tied.

1398
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,380
Everybody, I'm told.

1399
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:47,640
I didn't wanna take away your joy.

1400
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:51,840
Guys, like, I'm not that person.

1401
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,240
I would never...

1402
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,340
Oh, wait.

1403
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,900
Maybe if I do that.

1404
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,420
Maybe like...

1405
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,740
Trial and error, everybody.

1406
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:21,630
Trial and error.

1407
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:25,790
It will eventually work.

1408
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:30,190
Maybe I should put it on this side and then...

1409
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,440
Okay, but what if I put this and then put it over here?

1410
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,520
Okay, but not that.

1411
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,680
Okay, but what if I put this?

1412
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,520
Okay, that's way too heavy.

1413
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:54,940
Bam!

1414
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,500
So easy.

1415
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,260
Execution lever.

1416
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,800
Oh, no.

1417
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,900
This feels like a boss fight.

1418
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,840
Oh, this feels like a boss fight.

1419
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,360
Oh, my God.

1420
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,040
What is this?

1421
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,560
What is this?

1422
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:18,400
It's time to...

1423
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,440
It's time to super...

1424
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:21,200
Superman.

1425
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,460
It's time to crank that soldier boy.

1426
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,620
Crank that soldier boy.

1427
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,100
Crank that soldier boy.

1428
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,240
Wait, what does it say?

1429
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,700
For your grace, I do not plead.

1430
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:38,080
For the flames, I did set free.

1431
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,060
Sisters shriek and children cry.

1432
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,760
No one made it out alive.

1433
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,140
The fuck?

1434
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:46,920
Okay.

1435
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,880
I have to read?

1436
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:02,300
This?

1437
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,680
Assume it's that.

1438
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:13,680
Okay.

1439
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,780
The wealth of others I did take.

1440
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:19,480
The seven statues I did break.

1441
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,400
And yet my deeds I don't regret.

1442
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:22,860
I had my reason.

1443
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:23,800
That is that.

1444
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,860
The fuck?

1445
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:27,140
Okay.

1446
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,160
Okay, it's not that.

1447
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,740
No, it can't be that.

1448
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,480
But it can't be that either.

1449
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:38,580
Oh, this one.

1450
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,340
That has to be two.

1451
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:46,540
Oh, shit.

1452
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,200
No, that's two.

1453
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,280
I didn't realize.

1454
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:53,980
I thought when you get it right, it'll just like...

1455
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:54,920
Okay, I took the child.

1456
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,540
You were quite right.

1457
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:56,800
Carried her off into night.

1458
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:57,480
She did not scream.

1459
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,380
She did not bawl.

1460
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,140
I was her father after all.

1461
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:03,640
Which one's about the child?

1462
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:07,480
There you go.

1463
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,540
My only daughter.

1464
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:09,880
Joy of days.

1465
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,180
They wanted to take you away.

1466
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,460
Hush, little baby.

1467
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,880
Maybe he's still.

1468
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,280
If I can't have you, no one.

1469
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,220
God, that's so dark.

1470
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,080
Once the sun has ceased its rain, I cut through the rusty chain.

1471
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,060
Pushed the door and snuck within.

1472
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,120
Filled my pockets to the brim.

1473
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,580
This one.

1474
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,520
I departed with great haste, leaving not a single trace.

1475
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,220
Ever faithful to my creed, all is right, which feeds my greed.

1476
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:40,340
Mommy dearest, mommy sweet, your love for me was so deep.

1477
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,260
Why, oh why, you shouted out when my night pierced through your...

1478
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,440
That doesn't even rhyme.

1479
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,380
Out heart?

1480
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:47,500
Sweet deep?

1481
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:48,860
The fuck?

1482
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,040
That's not a rhyme.

1483
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,920
Everything else rhymed.

1484
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:00,820
Wait, what?

1485
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,920
Okay, this one, that's definitely this.

1486
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,020
Oh, it's not poems?

1487
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,380
Well, anyway.

1488
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:12,960
There you go.

1489
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,680
I did it.

1490
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,820
I didn't do it?

1491
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:23,990
Is that it?

1492
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,830
No more will I raise my ass to truth.

1493
01:29:42,830 --> 01:29:44,270
I see all I taste.

1494
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:45,150
What the fuck?

1495
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,000
Which one did I fuck up?

1496
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,680
Pull ye but once on the ropes, choose the ones justified from among the damned.

1497
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,300
Seek out their tales, think upon each sin, or let blind fate choose.

1498
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:08,800
Let the judgment begin.

1499
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,660
Oh, I have to pick a sin!

1500
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,980
Oh no, they're all pretty bad.

1501
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,320
I guess the first one?

1502
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:42,820
The first one?

1503
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:44,860
I say the first one, number one.

1504
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:50,710
Everyone else committed to the crime.

1505
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:57,700
I feel like the first one was the least worst.

1506
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:03,160
Then a lot of orphans died, so like, no one made it out alive.

1507
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,480
I mean, like, that's just money.

1508
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,780
Four is literally money.

1509
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,280
I guess.

1510
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,080
Like, he just took money, it's not that bad.

1511
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:32,240
Yeah, four, like, stole.

1512
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:47,910
Like, he stole one thing.

1513
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:51,450
Um, I guess four?

1514
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:54,710
How do I pick?

1515
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:00,870
I choose four.

1516
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:04,610
How do I pick it?

1517
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:12,910
I mean, one is more...

1518
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:14,150
I can't remove it.

1519
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:15,050
It won't let me remove.

1520
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:20,990
Yeah, it won't let me remove it.

1521
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,980
How do I remove it?

1522
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,340
There's a noose?

1523
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:37,790
Oh, shit!

1524
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,540
Fuck, okay, I'm gonna save.

1525
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,260
I didn't realize there was stuff behind me!

1526
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:52,580
Okay.

1527
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,360
Alright, well...

1528
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:01,680
One was justified, because he was trying to, you know...

1529
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:05,360
I mean, like, out of all of them, it's like, which one is the most justified?

1530
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,060
I guess one is the most justified, because he was trying to save them.

1531
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:22,910
And then, like...

1532
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:26,550
And then, I guess that...

1533
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:27,710
Oh, my God.

1534
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:27,830
Okay.

1535
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:37,930
Because, like, I feel like four is not really justified.

1536
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:41,290
He just did it for, like, money reasons.

1537
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:43,050
And then...

1538
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:45,450
It's either one or six, I feel.

1539
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:49,630
Six was, like, self-defense.

1540
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,390
Yeah, it's either one or six.

1541
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:54,610
Um...

1542
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:56,450
I'll do one.

1543
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:10,510
It's okay, it's just...

1544
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:16,810
Did I live?

1545
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,660
Where am I?

1546
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,740
Did I do it?

1547
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:32,120
Did...

1548
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,620
Was it correct?

1549
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:36,140
I don't know.

1550
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:39,380
I don't know.

1551
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:45,080
I can't tell if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

1552
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,500
Don't worry, the...

1553
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:58,210
It's alive.

1554
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:06,400
Wait, I can't...

1555
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,660
Oh, my God.

1556
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,200
Down I go, I guess.

1557
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:16,460
I guess down I go.

1558
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,580
Take the jump!

1559
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:22,720
Don't worry, the mask will cushion the drop.

1560
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,140
Girl, thank you for the super chat.

1561
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:27,860
Thank you, thank you.

1562
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,620
One of my joys watching you play horror games.

1563
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:31,360
Do a flip!

1564
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,500
Thank you for the super chat.

1565
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,420
Thank you, thank you.

1566
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:38,990
Oh, my God.

1567
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:40,070
Now where am I?

1568
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:43,910
Oh, back to black mode.

1569
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:45,270
Let's go.

1570
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:48,410
To be fair, it's the least of his worries, black mode.

1571
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:51,530
That's a slow death versus instantaneous.

1572
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:54,110
Alright, down you go again!

1573
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:56,610
Down is up, as they all say.

1574
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:59,410
The hole is your goal.

1575
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:01,250
It's made for you, James.

1576
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,430
Alright, now where am I?

1577
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:17,010
Oh, shit, ammo.

1578
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:18,650
Sweet, that was a good hole.

1579
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:21,050
Look at that, James!

1580
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,350
You chose a good hole!

1581
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:25,870
Oh!

1582
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:28,490
Oh, fuck, I'm like a little mouse.

1583
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,110
No!

1584
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:35,750
I'm in a mouse trap!

1585
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:38,870
No!

1586
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,930
They baited me with cheese!

1587
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:48,170
Like a fucking rat!

1588
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:53,750
I've been caught like a rat!

1589
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:57,150
They knew I was desperate!

1590
01:36:57,710 --> 01:37:00,010
I just wanted my cheese!

1591
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,260
Oh, no.

1592
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,740
How did they know?

1593
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,820
How did they know I wanted cheese?

1594
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:23,360
Oh, I'm in the labyrinth.

1595
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,640
Wait, that does not sound like a good time.

1596
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:27,500
Hello?

1597
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:27,720
Hello?

1598
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,960
I got handgun ammo now.

1599
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:39,200
Hello?

1600
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:48,560
Hello?

1601
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,020
Hello?

1602
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:54,960
You got the rat!

1603
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,210
The rat has been caught!

1604
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:01,610
You can let me go now!

1605
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:05,990
You know when you catch a rat and then you let it go outside into the wild?

1606
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:08,570
Angela?

1607
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:08,770
Angela?

1608
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:12,770
Angela, is everything okay?

1609
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:15,250
Angela?

1610
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:22,800
Oh?

1611
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,480
Oh, I don't like this place, Angela.

1612
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:30,500
Oh, look, more meds.

1613
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,900
More meds.

1614
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:35,560
I think it's trying to tell me something by giving me all these meds.

1615
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,420
Is it trying to tell me to take my meds?

1616
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:38,120
I don't understand.

1617
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:44,060
I think the game handing me 17 fucking medication bottles is trying to tell me something.

1618
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:51,300
I'll take my meds eventually, okay?

1619
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:55,200
I just don't want the voices to disappear.

1620
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:02,740
Angela?

1621
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:08,420
Angela?

1622
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:13,390
Angela, it's me.

1623
01:39:13,450 --> 01:39:14,090
It's me!

1624
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:16,290
See my crazy dog head?

1625
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,120
What the fuck is that?

1626
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,980
What the fuck?

1627
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,720
Oh, shit!

1628
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,260
This is what this was for.

1629
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,200
Oh, shit, that's not what I meant to do!

1630
01:39:58,660 --> 01:39:59,080
Oh, fuck!

1631
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,580
Corridor!

1632
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,780
Oh, I can!

1633
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:09,580
I was gonna say!

1634
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,160
Okay, that's good.

1635
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,860
That's not good!

1636
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:31,710
Where'd he go?

1637
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:42,480
Where'd he go?

1638
01:40:46,690 --> 01:40:47,270
Hello?

1639
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:50,790
Oh, hey, ammo.

1640
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:52,210
Got it.

1641
01:40:55,350 --> 01:41:01,670
I just realized that's not a pink thing, guys.

1642
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:03,710
Oh, no!

1643
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,630
Knock, knock.

1644
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:09,130
PT time?

1645
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:11,190
Angela?

1646
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:13,470
Angela, I did it!

1647
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:20,470
Angela?

1648
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:22,850
Angela?

1649
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:23,530
Angela, are you okay?

1650
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:26,850
Okay, god, okay!

1651
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:29,330
Am I wasting ammo by shooting him?

1652
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:33,870
I need to know this now.

1653
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:38,750
Okay, I'm not.

1654
01:41:38,810 --> 01:41:39,750
Okay, that's good.

1655
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:45,470
Alright, that's good to know.

1656
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:48,570
Alright, shooting's fine.

1657
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:54,910
I just have to be sure.

1658
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:57,490
Angela, don't worry, Angela!

1659
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:58,630
It's not...

1660
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:00,270
Not him!

1661
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:07,880
Oh...

1662
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:11,760
Oh, that's her hidey corner.

1663
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,340
Oh, that's so sad.

1664
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,960
Oh, that's her safe corner.

1665
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,120
Safe space.

1666
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:28,280
Okay.

1667
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:31,660
Is there any sure ammo anywhere?

1668
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,440
Okay.

1669
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:38,660
Let's go.

1670
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:45,700
Huh?

1671
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,640
What?

1672
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:11,740
Oh!

1673
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,980
Oh, shit!

1674
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,760
Oh, oh, oh!

1675
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:31,360
Okay, goodbye!

1676
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:33,420
Goodbye!

1677
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:38,870
Wait, did he leave?

1678
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:39,710
Oh, nice.

1679
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:41,810
Nice, he left.

1680
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:43,970
Angela, I did it, Angela!

1681
01:43:44,370 --> 01:43:46,630
He's gone forever for real this time!

1682
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,210
For real, Angela!

1683
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:52,890
He's definitely gone now!

1684
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:55,090
Okay.

1685
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:59,650
Oh, this is a safe space area.

1686
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:00,770
Can

1687
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:12,790
I go back into the safe space?

1688
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:15,370
No?

1689
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:21,720
Oh.

1690
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:24,360
Oh, oh!

1691
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:29,610
How are you still alive?!

1692
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:36,180
Bullets!

1693
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,640
Oh, shit!

1694
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:43,140
Damn, suck!

1695
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:45,720
Please!

1696
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:59,130
Who are you?!

1697
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:01,390
Holy fuck!

1698
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:08,160
I had 40 shotgun ammo!

1699
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:14,100
I had to melee the door!

1700
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:15,800
Holy shit!

1701
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:27,070
Where do I go at this point?

1702
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:27,170
Oh, good.

1703
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:33,370
He's actually pretty- Oh my god, I'm gonna start meleeing.

1704
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:34,870
I don't wanna waste more ammo anymore.

1705
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,840
He's way too tanky.

1706
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:55,800
He's way too tanky.

1707
01:45:55,900 --> 01:46:00,300
I already wasted way too much shotgun ammo for this guy.

1708
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:34,740
Hello?

1709
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,440
Oh, this way.

1710
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,960
Oh, I'm sorry!

1711
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,660
I'm so sorry!

1712
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:51,300
Oh, it's this way.

1713
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:56,720
I'm sorry for freaking all your TVs, but who uses TVs anymore anyway, you know?

1714
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,500
Like, I'm just doing you a service.

1715
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:01,480
Nobody uses TVs anyway, anyway.

1716
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,180
I think you're a bad person.

1717
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:09,800
Oh my god.

1718
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:22,220
Yeah?

1719
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:25,220
You think I'm special?

1720
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,520
Okay.

1721
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:37,640
Okay.

1722
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:39,320
Oh.

1723
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:42,500
Oh, that's flesh.

1724
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,200
Oh, that's flesh right there.

1725
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:46,940
Oh.

1726
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,760
Oh!

1727
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:50,360
It's- Oh!

1728
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:53,820
Oh, it's- Yep.

1729
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:55,300
Yep.

1730
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,260
That's right!

1731
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,720
I'm ready to fucking brawl!

1732
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:02,900
Come at me!

1733
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:02,980
Come at me!

1734
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,800
That's right!

1735
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,620
Better smash!

1736
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:13,840
That's right!

1737
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:16,380
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1738
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:17,240
You're so slow!

1739
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:18,880
Oh!

1740
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:22,040
That's right!

1741
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:23,500
Fighting time!

1742
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,420
No more ammo wasted!

1743
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:34,520
I'm gonna save this for Silent Hill 3!

1744
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,700
Saving my bullets for Silent Hill 3!

1745
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:40,560
Let's go!

1746
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:47,980
I already gave you 420 of my ammo!

1747
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,880
It's fucking right!

1748
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,540
Oh, I'm sorry!

1749
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:54,900
I'm so sorry!

1750
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:56,280
I was just joking!

1751
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:00,600
Oh, he's tired now.

1752
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:05,580
He's like, alright, give me a sec, I gotta get my energy back right there.

1753
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,360
I grabbed you once, and now I gotta get my energy back.

1754
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:18,600
Oh my god, get piped!

1755
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:24,720
Being a dork- Wait, where did you come from?

1756
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:25,080
Come on!

1757
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:33,640
I like how he was like, alright, give me like 10 seconds first, I didn't think I was gonna grab you.

1758
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,460
Angela with a steel chair!

1759
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,080
What?

1760
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:00,600
What?

1761
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,040
My wife?

1762
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,660
My wife.

1763
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,580
Oh!

1764
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:28,420
What?

1765
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:29,600
I just killed your father!

1766
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:47,860
Angela...

1767
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:52,040
I was gonna say something really fucked up, but I restrained myself.

1768
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:54,180
You see?

1769
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,100
My wife!

1770
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:57,640
My wife!

1771
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:10,810
Doki, no.

1772
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:12,210
Not the time.

1773
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:27,100
Huh?

1774
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,220
That's not true!

1775
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:37,360
Look, I know you see all these hot, sexy ladies around- monster ladies around me, but that's not true!

1776
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:38,220
They were just thoughts.

1777
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:58,740
Bye!

1778
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,360
Goodbye, Angela!

1779
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:13,770
I would never ignore those hot, sexy nurses and like, legs all around me, guys.

1780
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:14,810
I would never.

1781
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:19,550
Oh, there they are.

1782
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:26,060
Jesus fucking Christ.

1783
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,180
That was just a painting.

1784
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:34,110
Okay.

1785
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:36,690
Let's see.

1786
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:38,370
Where do I go?

1787
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:39,490
Oh, I guess I go this way.

1788
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:42,430
Also, Cody, thank you for the Akasupa!

1789
01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:43,530
Thank you!

1790
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:46,010
It's an Akasupa!

1791
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:47,470
Thank you so much!

1792
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:47,990
Oh, it's this way.

1793
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:50,110
Here's some sandy funds, Doki.

1794
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:51,530
You need it more than I do.

1795
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:55,430
Silent Hill has really done more damage to your sanity.

1796
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:56,230
I know.

1797
01:52:56,430 --> 01:53:01,270
This game has fucked me up the most out of all the games I've played.

1798
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:02,890
Thank you for the Akasupa!

1799
01:53:03,130 --> 01:53:03,410
Thank you!

1800
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,890
I can't believe it.

1801
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:13,470
Oh my God, from 40-something bullets to 18.

1802
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:20,750
I should've- If I knew I could've just piped him, I could've saved so much ammo.

1803
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:26,510
I- I could've saved so much.

1804
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:30,140
Oh.

1805
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,740
I just told a labyrinth.

1806
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:33,220
Oh.

1807
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:34,780
Oh.

1808
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:36,380
Whoa.

1809
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:42,120
Oh my God, look at those body parts.

1810
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:42,740
Whoa!

1811
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:45,480
Mary, don't look.

1812
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:48,920
Oh.

1813
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:49,020
Oh.

1814
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:53,800
Mary, don't look.

1815
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:54,860
I'm gonna go.

1816
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,800
Oh, I can't.

1817
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:00,580
It's calling me.

1818
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:02,260
It's calling me.

1819
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:03,420
You don't understand.

1820
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:04,620
Mary, don't look.

1821
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:05,520
It's calling me.

1822
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:09,940
Don't look, Mary.

1823
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,180
I swear, it's not you.

1824
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:14,320
It's just calling me.

1825
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:27,150
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

1826
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:27,910
Thank you, thank you.

1827
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:30,710
I think you mixed some text earlier, but...

1828
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:35,690
Angela stabbed his father before coming to Silent Hill, and the app shot Daddy?

1829
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:37,370
Yes, as bad as you think.

1830
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:38,270
Thank you for the super chat.

1831
01:54:38,350 --> 01:54:38,910
Thank you, thank you.

1832
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:40,050
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

1833
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:50,060
Maria?

1834
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:51,360
Wasn't she dead?

1835
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:53,400
Yeah.

1836
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:56,000
Am I even gonna see her?

1837
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:56,840
Oh, there she is.

1838
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:06,620
James?

1839
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:14,500
James, did you- James, did you not- James, we gave you 17 medication bottles.

1840
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,420
Did you not take any?

1841
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:17,540
Wait, my popcorn.

1842
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:21,920
It was just a prank.

1843
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:23,420
Get pranked.

1844
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,280
Oh my god, am I getting gaslighted?

1845
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,880
Silly James.

1846
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:37,640
Remember that time in the hotel?

1847
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:39,200
Maria?

1848
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,440
You said you took everything.

1849
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,460
But you forgot that video tape we made.

1850
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:46,520
A video tape?

1851
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:49,300
James, you fucking freak.

1852
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,440
Oh, wow.

1853
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,440
I'm not your Mary.

1854
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:03,020
Whoa.

1855
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:03,780
Maria.

1856
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:05,560
I am.

1857
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,280
Whoa, Jen!

1858
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:13,300
I'm saying, James, she's her, but alive.

1859
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:18,560
And she can't die, so she'll never get whatever terminal disease she had- Mary had.

1860
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:30,060
Remember the video tape we made together?

1861
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,260
I'm real, see?

1862
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:36,800
How did you get underneath my mask?

1863
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,400
Oh, she freaky, freaky.

1864
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:44,460
The dog mask stays on.

1865
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:49,480
I have a collar on this mask.

1866
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:21,840
James, we have two more days, James.

1867
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:25,180
Stay strong.

1868
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,780
We have two more days.

1869
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:37,000
Stay strong, James.

1870
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:39,920
Resist her.

1871
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,940
Don't let the temptations win.

1872
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:49,440
You're almost there, soldier.

1873
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:51,570
The fuck is this?

1874
01:58:00,190 --> 01:58:02,510
He just came out of morning chat.

1875
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:06,230
What the

1876
01:58:11,150 --> 01:58:11,710
fuck?

1877
01:58:13,890 --> 01:58:14,730
Is this a map?

1878
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:17,550
Let's see.

1879
01:58:21,570 --> 01:58:23,070
Oh, I did it.

1880
01:58:24,150 --> 01:58:24,550
Okay.

1881
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:29,250
I was trying to figure out what the fuck this was, but I did it, I guess.

1882
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:32,850
I was just trying to, like, figure it out.

1883
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:37,230
I don't know how I did it, but it's done.

1884
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:41,270
I don't know what I did.

1885
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:51,080
Oh, the labyrinth.

1886
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,480
Oh, the labyrinth.

1887
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:55,460
Oh, the labyrinth.

1888
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:58,100
How long will I be stuck in a maze?

1889
01:58:58,440 --> 01:58:59,340
Let's find out.

1890
01:58:59,940 --> 01:59:01,060
Let's find out.

1891
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:06,720
Let's find out how long I'm gonna be stuck down here.

1892
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:06,780
Is this the door?

1893
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:15,400
Okay, it's this door.

1894
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,380
Oh, come on.

1895
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:27,440
Come on!

1896
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:29,000
I just got here!

1897
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:32,520
And now you're giving me bugs?!

1898
01:59:40,610 --> 01:59:41,790
Oh my god.

1899
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:46,390
Dyslexic, thank you for the super chat.

1900
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:47,170
Thank you, thank you.

1901
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,010
What are you buying?

1902
01:59:48,270 --> 01:59:53,250
Wait, wrong franchise with blonde hair, jacket-wearing protagonist, and a monster invested talent.

1903
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:54,370
Thank you for the super chat.

1904
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:55,670
Thank you, thank you.

1905
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:04,510
Some people just loop around quite a bit here.

1906
02:00:04,590 --> 02:00:05,550
Oh, I'm some people.

1907
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,630
That's me.

1908
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:08,310
That sounds like something I do.

1909
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:11,870
From a place called the fucking labyrinth?

1910
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,330
Yeah.

1911
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:20,290
This directionless bird is already fucking directionless.

1912
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:22,210
Let's give her a maze.

1913
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:23,690
Wouldn't that be funny?

1914
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:28,470
Oh my god!

1915
02:00:28,530 --> 02:00:29,550
Are you serious?

1916
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:30,190
Okay.

1917
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:33,450
I'm picking the one with no bugs.

1918
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:36,430
I'm going the easy route.

1919
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:45,230
Alright.

1920
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:52,820
Oh, there's still bugs?!

1921
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:53,720
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1922
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:02,800
I hate this.

1923
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,340
I hate this.

1924
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:13,600
I- I hate this room.

1925
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:19,020
I hear some- I fucking hear you.

1926
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,400
I knew it!

1927
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:21,760
I knew it!

1928
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,900
I knew you were you fucking mouth man!

1929
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,440
I fucking knew it.

1930
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:29,260
I knew it.

1931
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,540
I- I heard him.

1932
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:34,160
I heard him walking out the back there.

1933
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:37,260
Oh my god, you fucking freak.

1934
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:38,380
You're such a freak.

1935
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,060
Nobody loves you.

1936
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:42,360
Okay, now I'm here.

1937
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:49,300
Okay.

1938
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:53,180
What even is that?

1939
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:53,600
Woah!

1940
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:55,560
Okay.

1941
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:58,720
I expect you too.

1942
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:01,080
Alright, that's fine.

1943
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:03,860
More meds I won't take.

1944
02:02:08,890 --> 02:02:10,810
Why give me empty cabinets?

1945
02:02:13,770 --> 02:02:15,090
I knew it.

1946
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:20,510
You're supposed to come up when I go around the corner!

1947
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:26,130
There's just ammo.

1948
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:28,230
Thank god.

1949
02:02:30,930 --> 02:02:33,270
I gotta move this somewhere.

1950
02:02:35,810 --> 02:02:36,650
Okay, here.

1951
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:36,990
Alright.

1952
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:41,680
Boom!

1953
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:42,720
Thank you for the super chat!

1954
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:43,880
Thank you!

1955
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:44,000
Oh.

1956
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,680
Alright, up we go.

1957
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:49,720
Alright.

1958
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:51,760
Alright, James.

1959
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:52,840
It's time to go up.

1960
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:05,160
What?

1961
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:08,180
What?

1962
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:11,360
I don't like that.

1963
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:18,180
Where do I go?

1964
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:19,220
Where am I?

1965
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:23,650
Let's see what's in here.

1966
02:03:23,650 --> 02:03:26,570
Let's see what's rotating in this fridge.

1967
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:27,450
Woah!

1968
02:03:28,710 --> 02:03:29,310
Nothing!

1969
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:38,640
Is there anything in here?

1970
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:51,710
Is this Asmongold's house before he cleaned it?

1971
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:58,570
Oh, I got lighter gas.

1972
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:00,650
How do I use it though?

1973
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:12,390
What do I do with that though?

1974
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:18,900
Alright, move tab.

1975
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:20,700
Woah, there it is.

1976
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:22,940
Is there a map?

1977
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,300
There is.

1978
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:25,980
Oh my god.

1979
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:26,760
Where am I?

1980
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:32,720
Okay, that's a suspended cage.

1981
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,280
Oh my god.

1982
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:34,820
There is.

1983
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:35,220
I forgot.

1984
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:38,120
They like gave me a fucking...

1985
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:46,510
I forgot they gave me like a magic map.

1986
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:49,350
Thank fucking... Oh my god!

1987
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:49,850
Get out!

1988
02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:50,670
I'm leaving!

1989
02:04:50,670 --> 02:04:51,770
I'm leaving your house!

1990
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:54,430
Look, I'm gone.

1991
02:04:54,570 --> 02:04:55,070
I'm gone.

1992
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:55,670
Are you happy?

1993
02:04:55,890 --> 02:04:56,390
I left.

1994
02:04:59,430 --> 02:05:00,770
Look, there you go.

1995
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:05,490
This is locked, right?

1996
02:05:05,590 --> 02:05:05,790
Yeah.

1997
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:13,960
Oh, he's so freaking mad for no reason.

1998
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,980
Okay, I need something to light this up.

1999
02:05:24,120 --> 02:05:25,160
So touchy.

2000
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:28,680
So fucking touchy.

2001
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:32,860
Oh.

2002
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:35,680
Okay.

2003
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:37,960
Okay.

2004
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:39,700
Here we go.

2005
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:41,680
Alright.

2006
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:56,200
I hate this.

2007
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:58,180
I hate the sound.

2008
02:05:59,000 --> 02:05:59,680
I think...

2009
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:02,120
I hate the sound the most.

2010
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,100
That's...

2011
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:06,260
I think that's what...

2012
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:07,680
The...

2013
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:10,100
The fucking road sounds.

2014
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:11,600
Fucking...

2015
02:06:22,270 --> 02:06:24,230
Oh my god.

2016
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:27,250
Yeah, it's so nasty.

2017
02:06:27,310 --> 02:06:28,150
I hate it.

2018
02:06:28,330 --> 02:06:30,090
I hate it so much.

2019
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:42,730
God, I hate that.

2020
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:44,190
I hate it so much.

2021
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:46,270
Oh, no!

2022
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:47,110
Are you serious?

2023
02:06:47,270 --> 02:06:48,030
Get out!

2024
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:51,630
He likes you!

2025
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:52,910
Leave me alone!

2026
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:57,040
Oh my god, it's this one.

2027
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:58,380
Are you serious?

2028
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:01,120
I can't even see him.

2029
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:04,140
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

2030
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:04,720
Let me out.

2031
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,080
It's back here?

2032
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:11,580
Okay.

2033
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:13,860
Okay, I gotta go straight down.

2034
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,620
Okay, this is fucking awkward.

2035
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:21,220
Oh my god.

2036
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:21,800
Okay.

2037
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:26,440
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

2038
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:27,140
Thank you, thank you.

2039
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:29,220
Just giving among the sleep vibes.

2040
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:30,340
Good times.

2041
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:39,650
How do I get across though?

2042
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:41,690
The other side?

2043
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:54,540
Okay.

2044
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:01,520
Okay.

2045
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:02,340
Oh my god.

2046
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:07,220
Okay.

2047
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:10,180
I hate- Okay, there we go.

2048
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,140
Oh, there's somebody.

2049
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:15,280
Oh, there you are.

2050
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:16,300
I knew it.

2051
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,260
Oh, you fucking hit back?

2052
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,880
How dare you?

2053
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:23,540
Don't you know I'm the main protagonist?

2054
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:26,280
How fucking dare you hit back?

2055
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:32,390
Where am I now?

2056
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:36,490
Okay, there should be something to...

2057
02:08:36,490 --> 02:08:38,550
fucking do the lighter...

2058
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:39,990
fuel or something.

2059
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:42,290
I'm like stuttering right now.

2060
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:44,490
This game's got me.

2061
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:47,770
Alright, stick your hand in!

2062
02:08:47,810 --> 02:08:49,610
What's the worst that can happen, James?

2063
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:51,810
You stuck your hand in it worse!

2064
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:53,670
Let's go!

2065
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:05,910
Oh, there it is.

2066
02:09:05,930 --> 02:09:06,470
We got it.

2067
02:09:06,590 --> 02:09:07,330
We got what we needed.

2068
02:09:08,810 --> 02:09:09,290
Alright.

2069
02:09:13,170 --> 02:09:15,190
Now we got this thing.

2070
02:09:17,190 --> 02:09:19,210
Wait, it hit back faster?

2071
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:25,490
What the fuck are you doing over there?

2072
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:34,130
Get your ass out of here.

2073
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:40,620
Oh, fuck you!

2074
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:44,940
I know I shouldn't waste my bullets, but I hate this man.

2075
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:46,100
Nice!

2076
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:50,060
I particularly hate this guy.

2077
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:52,600
I hate him.

2078
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:53,980
I HATE HIM!

2079
02:09:57,580 --> 02:09:58,880
Oh my god.

2080
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,800
I can't even get out!

2081
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:06,230
Oh my god.

2082
02:10:06,270 --> 02:10:07,330
I hate him so much.

2083
02:10:07,410 --> 02:10:07,930
I hate him.

2084
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:09,050
I hate him.

2085
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:11,630
What the fuck?

2086
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:17,070
Guarded it!

2087
02:10:17,070 --> 02:10:17,250
Guarded it!

2088
02:10:20,030 --> 02:10:20,630
Okay.

2089
02:10:21,130 --> 02:10:22,970
That was actual bullshit.

2090
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:28,740
Like, what was I supposed to do in that scenario?

2091
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:33,220
He was literally capping the door!

2092
02:10:37,610 --> 02:10:38,570
What the hell?

2093
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:44,530
Oh, there she is.

2094
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:50,000
Well, I can...

2095
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:53,300
There we go.

2096
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:55,020
I was like, I'm pretty sure I can kill her.

2097
02:10:58,360 --> 02:10:59,600
What's this key for?

2098
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:02,140
The iron key?

2099
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:12,860
I like how it's like sexy nurses and monsters and then their office job.

2100
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:14,360
Oh, James.

2101
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:16,700
You can never escape the Ouija life.

2102
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:18,640
You're here forever.

2103
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:29,300
That's so silly of you to think you can escape the Ouija life.

2104
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:48,450
I'd rather get out of here.

2105
02:11:48,450 --> 02:11:49,950
I don't remember.

2106
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:52,490
Guys, I don't remember.

2107
02:11:52,810 --> 02:11:53,870
What was in this door?

2108
02:11:56,330 --> 02:11:56,850
Ah!

2109
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:01,940
Okay.

2110
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:04,640
Where am I?

2111
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:05,500
Yeah, I was.

2112
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:05,820
Okay.

2113
02:12:10,510 --> 02:12:12,390
Alright, we have everything we needed.

2114
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:14,970
I don't know what my iron key was for, though.

2115
02:12:15,070 --> 02:12:15,510
I don't...

2116
02:12:15,510 --> 02:12:18,370
I don't remember a locked door anywhere, guys.

2117
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:20,890
I actually don't remember what door was locked.

2118
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:29,160
Guys, what door was it that was locked?

2119
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:35,400
Am I right?

2120
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:38,540
Oh!

2121
02:12:38,980 --> 02:12:40,320
That door!

2122
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:45,120
It was this door.

2123
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:54,150
Oh my god, it's time to stick my hat in!

2124
02:12:55,130 --> 02:12:56,090
Let's go!

2125
02:12:57,330 --> 02:12:58,610
Third time's the charm!

2126
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:01,050
Alright.

2127
02:13:01,050 --> 02:13:01,710
Oh.

2128
02:13:03,570 --> 02:13:04,910
It's just gonna hurt a little.

2129
02:13:07,530 --> 02:13:09,190
C'mon, stick your hat in the acid!

2130
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:14,240
C'mon, do it, James!

2131
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:15,700
Stick your hat in the acid!

2132
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:19,040
Stick it in!

2133
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:20,380
Stick it in!

2134
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:23,820
Serious?

2135
02:13:36,920 --> 02:13:38,680
Oh, I have to, like, let it go.

2136
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:38,780
Let it go.

2137
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:48,180
Okay, that should be fine now.

2138
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:53,810
Alright, stick your hat in!

2139
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:54,710
Let's go!

2140
02:13:56,630 --> 02:13:58,290
Okay, nice, we got everything then.

2141
02:14:01,090 --> 02:14:02,750
That should be everything we need.

2142
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:08,450
Alright, let's save it up.

2143
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:23,760
Wait, I need to combine them first.

2144
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:24,260
Oh, I forgot.

2145
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:24,760
Okay.

2146
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:29,540
Uh...

2147
02:14:33,310 --> 02:14:35,070
Nice.

2148
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:47,470
What's in that body?

2149
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:52,410
What's in it?

2150
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:54,710
It's like a Christmas present!

2151
02:15:02,910 --> 02:15:04,590
Christmas is cancelled.

2152
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:12,100
Am I gonna jump into another hole?

2153
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:14,100
Oh my...

2154
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:14,420
Okay.

2155
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:18,100
Okay, James.

2156
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:23,740
I guess we're gonna jump into the other hole that we created.

2157
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:27,000
Alright, down we go.

2158
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:32,480
We know we have to jump down, James!

2159
02:15:38,590 --> 02:15:40,310
Time for another hole.

2160
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:44,400
Woah...

2161
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,440
When is there...

2162
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,660
When is one hole too many?

2163
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:03,080
Woah...

2164
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:03,500
Okay.

2165
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:06,540
We're still in the labyrinth?

2166
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:09,140
Oh, we're back here!

2167
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:10,800
Wait, what was the point?

2168
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:15,400
I didn't get anything important from that!

2169
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:17,500
Wait, what was the point?

2170
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:24,160
Wait, what?

2171
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:24,340
Why?

2172
02:16:27,580 --> 02:16:29,000
I guess the body?

2173
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:34,680
Okay, I still can.

2174
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,520
I guess the cube changed.

2175
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:37,940
Yeah.

2176
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:42,240
I was gonna say, like...

2177
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:52,280
I just felt like I didn't get anything important from that at all.

2178
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:55,140
Oh, I did it again.

2179
02:16:56,220 --> 02:16:57,100
Yay, brute force!

2180
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:57,720
Let's go!

2181
02:17:01,610 --> 02:17:03,230
Alright, down or up?

2182
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:12,180
I'll go up.

2183
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:14,320
I feel safer.

2184
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:18,440
I guess I go down.

2185
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:24,500
I guess I go down.

2186
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:31,880
It doesn't matter what they think.

2187
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:33,860
No?

2188
02:17:34,700 --> 02:17:36,420
Do I have to rotate the cube again?

2189
02:17:42,150 --> 02:17:44,350
Another entrance here?

2190
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:46,730
Oh, there's nothing!

2191
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:55,780
You think I can jump?

2192
02:17:56,820 --> 02:17:58,160
Oh, there's over here!

2193
02:17:58,280 --> 02:17:58,600
Okay.

2194
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:00,760
Let's see this exit.

2195
02:18:14,710 --> 02:18:16,970
It's a red door now.

2196
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:27,240
I...

2197
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:35,820
I'm so mad.

2198
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:40,800
It's you.

2199
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:44,160
It's fucking you.

2200
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:45,360
It's always you.

2201
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,560
It's always you.

2202
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:52,000
Oh, my God.

2203
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:53,400
When will you leave me alone?

2204
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:56,360
When will you leave me alone?

2205
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:02,210
Oh, my God.

2206
02:19:02,590 --> 02:19:03,950
Oh, my God.

2207
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:05,850
Oh, my God.

2208
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:10,230
We're leaving this for future Doki.

2209
02:19:10,290 --> 02:19:11,210
I can't.

2210
02:19:11,330 --> 02:19:11,850
I can't.

2211
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:17,650
I'm sorry.

2212
02:19:18,330 --> 02:19:21,990
I saw the spiders and I can't.

2213
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:23,130
I can't.

2214
02:19:23,130 --> 02:19:26,710
I saw the spiders.

2215
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:28,490
I can't.

2216
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:29,310
I can't deal.

2217
02:19:29,410 --> 02:19:30,890
I thought they were gone.

2218
02:19:31,350 --> 02:19:33,730
I didn't realize they were still here.

2219
02:19:35,230 --> 02:19:38,010
I thought they would leave me alone.

2220
02:19:39,330 --> 02:19:41,690
Why are they still here?

2221
02:19:46,210 --> 02:19:47,410
Then you'll...

2222
02:19:47,410 --> 02:19:50,090
Then future Doki will get to the good part.

2223
02:19:51,810 --> 02:19:56,330
Future Doki will get to the good part.

2224
02:19:56,690 --> 02:19:56,950
Alright.

2225
02:19:58,130 --> 02:19:58,730
Guys.

2226
02:19:58,950 --> 02:19:59,270
Okay.

2227
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:00,270
Okay, guys.

2228
02:20:00,330 --> 02:20:00,990
I need to know.

2229
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:05,610
How much more of the game do we have left?

2230
02:20:05,910 --> 02:20:08,950
Don't judge it by my time.

2231
02:20:09,210 --> 02:20:11,170
Don't judge it by the amount of time.

2232
02:20:11,170 --> 02:20:12,810
How long it's taking me.

2233
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:14,090
I need to know.

2234
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:15,630
How...

2235
02:20:15,630 --> 02:20:19,450
How much longer, like hours wise, do I have left?

2236
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:25,710
Okay.

2237
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:27,570
The next playthrough...

2238
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:29,450
I promise you guys this.

2239
02:20:29,770 --> 02:20:33,550
The next playthrough of Silent Hill...

2240
02:20:33,550 --> 02:20:34,890
We finish it.

2241
02:20:35,490 --> 02:20:36,330
We...

2242
02:20:36,330 --> 02:20:38,910
We actually finish it.

2243
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:44,210
We're gonna...

2244
02:20:44,210 --> 02:20:46,070
This will be the day.

2245
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:48,110
This will be the day.

2246
02:20:48,250 --> 02:20:49,070
Just remember.

2247
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:50,270
Yes.

2248
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:55,430
Part 7 is when we finally beat Silent Hill 2.

2249
02:20:56,010 --> 02:20:58,150
Future Doki is gonna kick your ass.

2250
02:20:58,290 --> 02:20:59,470
Thank you for the super chat.

2251
02:20:59,590 --> 02:21:00,550
Thank you.

2252
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:01,970
Alright.

2253
02:21:02,690 --> 02:21:05,330
Future Doki will...

2254
02:21:05,330 --> 02:21:07,590
Will handle it.

2255
02:21:08,150 --> 02:21:09,470
Thank you for the super chat.

2256
02:21:09,550 --> 02:21:09,730
Thank you.

2257
02:21:09,910 --> 02:21:12,670
Is it out?

2258
02:21:12,670 --> 02:21:13,730
Oh my god.

2259
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:15,850
Oh my god, is it out now?

2260
02:21:16,530 --> 02:21:18,050
Oh my god, it is!

2261
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:19,070
Oh yeah!

2262
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:22,940
The merch is out now.

2263
02:21:23,470 --> 02:21:23,750
Yeah.

2264
02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:25,050
Yes, and the postcard.

2265
02:21:25,130 --> 02:21:27,610
We have to sign there.

2266
02:21:28,210 --> 02:21:29,150
But yes.

2267
02:21:29,830 --> 02:21:31,870
The Phantom Thief...

2268
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:34,070
Merch is now out.

2269
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:43,950
We have t-shirts, keychain, lanyard, concert towel, penlight, postcards, ticket, and a tote bag.

2270
02:21:45,070 --> 02:21:46,570
I'll post a link right here.

2271
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:49,690
And also another thing to show is GamerStuffs, guys.

2272
02:21:49,990 --> 02:21:50,950
GamerStuffs, yay!

2273
02:21:56,370 --> 02:21:57,050
Let's see.

2274
02:21:57,590 --> 02:22:00,950
But yes, if you support me, we have GamerStuffs too.

2275
02:22:01,070 --> 02:22:01,710
There's so much stuff.

2276
02:22:01,790 --> 02:22:02,530
And then there's Hyatt.

2277
02:22:02,810 --> 02:22:05,110
There's the Hyatt keycaps.

2278
02:22:05,350 --> 02:22:06,130
And the...

2279
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:10,790
The keycaps and the PC case and everything.

2280
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:12,950
Oh my god, there's so much stuff to show.

2281
02:22:13,830 --> 02:22:15,870
There's so much stuff to show.

2282
02:22:16,190 --> 02:22:17,370
I'm so overwhelmed.

2283
02:22:17,950 --> 02:22:19,970
I'm not used to showing so much for things.

2284
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:22,510
Oh my god.

2285
02:22:22,590 --> 02:22:26,530
Okay, but next week, we'll finish Silent Hill 2.

2286
02:22:26,590 --> 02:22:27,550
I promise you guys.

2287
02:22:28,050 --> 02:22:31,250
Next week, we'll fucking finish Silent Hill 2.

2288
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:35,730
Guys, I promise you, it will be done for real this time.

2289
02:22:35,870 --> 02:22:36,650
I swear.

2290
02:22:37,570 --> 02:22:39,270
I fucking swear.

2291
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:40,310
Anyway, guys.

2292
02:22:41,150 --> 02:22:42,710
I'm gonna rest my voice.

2293
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:44,130
I'm tired.

2294
02:22:45,950 --> 02:22:47,670
Thank you all for coming.

2295
02:22:50,230 --> 02:22:51,390
PapaSmart, thank you for the superchat.

2296
02:22:51,490 --> 02:22:52,050
Thank you, thank you.

2297
02:22:52,110 --> 02:22:53,850
Is this a real promise or a top 500?

2298
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:55,450
I promise.

2299
02:22:55,770 --> 02:22:56,730
Thank you for the superchat.

2300
02:22:56,830 --> 02:22:57,670
Thank you, thank you.

2301
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:00,390
Fine, I promise you guys this.

2302
02:23:00,770 --> 02:23:06,730
Next week, we're finally gonna see the ending of Silent Hill 2.

2303
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:10,450
You do not have to wait for your kids' kids to see the ending.

2304
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:14,770
You will be alive to watch the ending of Silent Hill 2.

2305
02:23:14,970 --> 02:23:15,750
This is your day.

2306
02:23:15,930 --> 02:23:16,670
Not this today.

2307
02:23:16,990 --> 02:23:19,750
Next week is your day.

2308
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:21,890
I just can't do the spiders again right now.

2309
02:23:21,970 --> 02:23:22,470
The spiders.

2310
02:23:22,930 --> 02:23:25,830
I was already so fucking done.

2311
02:23:25,950 --> 02:23:27,050
I was so done.

2312
02:23:29,150 --> 02:23:33,650
During the fucking prison, I was so over it.

2313
02:23:33,770 --> 02:23:34,730
I couldn't.

2314
02:23:36,310 --> 02:23:40,810
After dealing with them in the prison level, I couldn't deal with them anymore.

2315
02:23:43,490 --> 02:23:44,790
I've hit my limit.

2316
02:23:45,070 --> 02:23:47,330
I've hit my limit with the spider, ladies.

2317
02:23:47,570 --> 02:23:49,610
It's just over for me, mentally.

2318
02:23:52,710 --> 02:23:54,010
Liam, thank you for the superchat.

2319
02:23:54,090 --> 02:23:54,870
Thank you, thank you.

2320
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:57,710
If you finish it now, you never have to play.

2321
02:23:57,710 --> 02:23:58,750
Guys, I can't.

2322
02:23:58,850 --> 02:23:59,330
I can't.

2323
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:00,250
I can't do it.

2324
02:24:00,350 --> 02:24:02,610
I don't know how long it's gonna take me to finish it.

2325
02:24:02,890 --> 02:24:05,130
Also, tomorrow's gonna be a long day as well.

2326
02:24:05,310 --> 02:24:08,050
I'm trying to make sure I don't overdo it today.

2327
02:24:08,570 --> 02:24:10,150
Next week, for sure guys.

2328
02:24:10,290 --> 02:24:10,690
For sure.

2329
02:24:11,750 --> 02:24:12,770
I'm gonna call it here.

2330
02:24:13,870 --> 02:24:15,450
I'm gonna rest my voice for next week.

2331
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:17,890
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

2332
02:24:18,070 --> 02:24:18,690
Posture check.

2333
02:24:18,930 --> 02:24:20,710
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2334
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:23,170
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

2335
02:24:23,670 --> 02:24:24,730
You deserve it.

2336
02:24:24,830 --> 02:24:26,370
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2337
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:27,410
Bye guys.

2338
02:24:27,670 --> 02:24:27,970
Bye.

2339
02:24:28,190 --> 02:24:29,170
Next week is the custom!

2340
02:24:30,250 --> 02:24:32,250
There's some fires I have to put out again today.

2341
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:34,930
I just got like a shit ton of messages regarding it.

2342
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:37,090
I cannot wait for it to be over.

2343
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:40,690
So I don't have to always put out fires.

2344
02:24:42,030 --> 02:24:45,430
Anyway, off back to work in the mines.

2345
02:24:45,550 --> 02:24:47,830
In the coal mines of this custom.

2346
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:50,170
Anyway, bye-bye everybody.

2347
02:24:50,570 --> 02:24:51,010
Bye.

2348
02:24:53,130 --> 02:24:53,490
Bye.

2349
02:24:54,070 --> 02:24:54,690
Where's the ending?

2350
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:55,290
Oh, there it is.

2351
02:24:55,350 --> 02:24:55,690
Bye.

2352
02:24:56,190 --> 02:24:57,990
I was gonna say, where's my ending screen at?

2353
02:25:04,990 --> 02:25:05,630
Sorry, yeah.

2354
02:25:05,710 --> 02:25:06,070
Tomorrow.

2355
02:25:06,190 --> 02:25:06,930
Tomorrow's the custom.

2356
02:25:07,150 --> 02:25:08,650
Guys, my mind is so fried.

2357
02:25:09,790 --> 02:25:10,450
Bye-bye.
