1
00:01:48,430 --> 00:02:58,130
hello everybody hello hello it's another day for dokeybug um but yeah today we're gonna be doing a semi-long stream not too long because you know the week just started i don't want to fuck up my voice at the start of the week because we still have four more streams to do in the next couple days um but uh we're gonna do a semi-long maybe like four to five hours and then i want uh today today i want to do a little uh super chat oh my gosh finally we might be able to do super chat reading tonight i just want to chat with my dragoons for a little bit too post stream because you know i'm feeling a little quirky today um uh i wish in my voice and i'm ready to fuck it up all over again it's a cycle of pain anyway oh okay okay okay you guys didn't notice uh my youtube banner has finally updated after 20 years yeah i actually got a lot of these updated graphics a while ago um but i just i was just lazy and i didn't i don't know just just i guess like you know when you're updating graphics you

2
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:47,670
gotta update everything so like everything for your channel so because like i had these graphics done a while ago including the panels but i was like oh that requires me to update everything because if i'm gonna update the graphics i might as well just get everything done at once so i don't have to come back to it do it i'm gonna be productive so we have new panels on twitch and finally uh finally added all the emotes i forgot to add on twitch as well as uh the new youtube banner too so if you guys check youtube the new banner now um it's actually um oh what's the way like um you know i was going to remember elaine like i i was saving all my old graphics and stuff uh from my pre I guess,

3
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,630
like, pre-Corporeal era.

4
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:57,030
Because all those graphics were basically, like, yeah, I was going through memory lane, going through nostalgia, finally updating those graphics.

5
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,250
Because I had those graphics done, like, five-plus years ago.

6
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,810
That's how long it's been.

7
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,890
It's been there for five years.

8
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,450
Not even, maybe even longer than five years.

9
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,370
The original graphic designer.

10
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,630
Yeah, because it was RetroDoki.

11
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,990
The original graphic designer that did them.

12
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:23,630
She, like, when I became Corpo, she literally quit graphic design.

13
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,230
Like, she fucking disappeared off the internet to become a doctor.

14
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,430
That's, like, she literally disappeared.

15
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,850
The one, the person who did the original OG graphics.

16
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,470
Yeah, she, like, disappeared off the internet.

17
00:04:43,510 --> 00:05:23,040
I've always loved her graphics, because I always, I wanted to, like, redo my stuff uh but she hasn't been active for like since i joined a company bro actually became a doctor yeah she's out there saving lives instead of making graphics for anime girls what what a glow up um um uh but yeah um i'm glad today i've been extra productive i needed that because I've been procrastinating a lot and just,

18
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,160
I've been zoning out and procrastinating a lot these days just because I've been, I feel, I don't want to say burnt out.

19
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,180
I've just been like, I guess overworked.

20
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:45,800
I've been feeling a bit overworked lately and by, it's not good that instead of like, you know, like it's not good that like to, my solution to recover from overwork is to stop working.

21
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,700
That's like, I don't know.

22
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,860
And then I came back to where I was like, wow, look at all the work that built up because I just stopped.

23
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
It's a cycle.

24
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,020
The cycle of pain continues.

25
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,160
I come back from not working just to see even more work.

26
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,000
How could this happen?

27
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,660
You mean if I stop working and more work, the work doesn't stop as well.

28
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,080
It just keeps piling on.

29
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,720
Who could have foresaw that?

30
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,620
Who would have known?

31
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,340
Who would have thought?

32
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,260
That's what happens.

33
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,040
If you don't do your work, the work itself doesn't just disappear and it just keeps coming in.

34
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,980
What a twist.

35
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,540
The world keeps spinning.

36
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,260
Who knew?

37
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,980
I thought I was the main gifter.

38
00:06:47,660 --> 00:07:48,020
uh next thing thank you for the super chat thank you thank you thank you guys thank you the super chat thank you thank you excuse me it's dr graphic designer for you thank you the super chat thank you thank you um but yeah so i today i was trying to be extra productive today like not only just updating my twitch and youtube but also um um getting all my um making sure like um making sure well i didn't answer all my my messages because i'll never be able to finish answering all my messages but you know just keeping up keeping keeping up to date with some things so yeah productive productive dokey today i might try to be productive after today's stream too might not just be like a three hour thing maybe maybe this entire week is going to be productive dokey whoa got subscribed to find out more if she does if she does become productive for this week.

39
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,620
Anyway, it is Doki Bug Time back into Silk Song.

40
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:10,140
So we have a little problem because today might be a filler episode because I realized during last stream, I did not gather any new charms or any new tools or basically anything.

41
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,740
I literally bashed my head against the wall until like I forced myself into the citadel.

42
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,720
uh

43
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:35,730
I was just like let me in And I threw my dead body against the wall like I don't know how many times Until a crack showed and I was like it can bleed and I slipped right in

44
00:08:39,020 --> 00:09:12,820
After 50 dokiabug bodies I was finally led into the citadel um so we might have to backtrack today to grab some stuff because apparently the citadel is like actual hell um not only is it super capitalism but there's a lot of bad things there so i might i have i might have to backtrack but then i will require you guys to help me with backtracking because i don't know what to do all right also there's two saves because the other save i was

45
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,060
on how to play.

46
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,600
But I didn't want to get off the chair.

47
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,380
Because this is what happens when I get off the chair.

48
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:35,020
So so I um, so I put up a new save because I was like, how do I play this game again?

49
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,480
I didn't want to deal with super capitalism.

50
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,220
Um, alright.

51
00:09:46,160 --> 00:10:07,640
uh gambit thank you for the super chat thank you thank you thank you thank you everybody for drawing a dokey bug all right i really i really appreciate it guys i have so much so many cute thumbnail the cute art to use for thumbnails the anti-poor benches it's only been you don't understand

52
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
I gotta figure out where to go, too.

53
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,840
Alright, we just gotta pogo this.

54
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,760
Oh, oh, I forgot I can float.

55
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,420
See, I told you I forgot, like, basic mechanics.

56
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,680
Alright, well, in order to be able to...

57
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,340
Oh, shit.

58
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,540
Alright, in order... Oh, shit.

59
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,140
Okay, it's fine.

60
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,480
In order to be able to grab anything, we gotta figure out how to get out of the Citadel.

61
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,820
Get out of here.

62
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,720
Go back to the slab and go left from the stag station.

63
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,120
Import.

64
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,520
Upgrade.

65
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,300
That way, don't worry.

66
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,640
You're supposed to be there.

67
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:55,580
Wait.

68
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,960
But like...

69
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,660
But like, why?

70
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,700
How?

71
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,400
Because like, I have nothing here.

72
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
But I have nothing.

73
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,320
Oh, no.

74
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,300
Now remember why I stopped playing last time.

75
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,420
Oh, Oh, no.

76
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,620
I remembered.

77
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,820
Wait, what's down here?

78
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,320
Is that... Is there anything down here, or is that death, guys?

79
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,460
I don't remember.

80
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,060
I don't know.

81
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,300
I'm scared.

82
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,740
I look down, and it's just the abyss.

83
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,120
It's just...

84
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,860
Oh, that's not so bad.

85
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,220
Okay, that's not so bad.

86
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,200
Okay, yeah, no, that was death.

87
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,560
Okay.

88
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,920
That's good to know.

89
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,080
Okay.

90
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,760
This part I was like...

91
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,860
I was scared.

92
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,900
Also, I bought myself some London fog.

93
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I needed some caffeine.

94
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,780
I didn't want to drink actual coffee.

95
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,080
So...

96
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,920
London fog...

97
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,440
London fog saved my life in university.

98
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,320
It's literally my...

99
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,980
It's my go-to...

100
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,480
It was my go-to study drink in university.

101
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,980
Oh, thank you for the rain!

102
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,980
Oh, I missed out the name, but thank you so much for the raid.

103
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
I appreciate it.

104
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,160
We had a good stream.

105
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,260
Oh, this is where I died.

106
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,500
I hesitated.

107
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,800
Oh, my God.

108
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,200
I hesitated again.

109
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,720
Oh, Tori, thank you for the...

110
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,120
No!

111
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:41,960
Alright.

112
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,820
Okay.

113
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,340

Oh That's cool Please let me farm you Oh my god.

117
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,080
What am I looking at geometry?

118
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,900
What the fuck is this?

119
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,520
Okay

120
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,460
All right now I'm here Okay, you definitely don't look like a good person.

121
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,380
But you're my heal.

122
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,240
Alright, I killed the janitor.

123
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,820
I am a good person.

124
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,300
I did it, guys.

125
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,700
I killed the janitor.

126
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,180
Oh!

127
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,920
Okay, we're fine.

128
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,540
Where is this place?

129
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,860
I don't remember this place.

130
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,420
Oh, wait.

131
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,820
What was the other area here, right?

132
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,680
Alright.

133
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,620
Gotta kill him.

134
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,720
I feel like he has something good.

135
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,000
Maybe?

136
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:29,900
Okay.

137
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,440
There you go.

138
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,120
I assume he has that...

139
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,560
Oh, nice.

140
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,000
There's a little thing here.

141
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,120
Okay, that's not...

142
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,540
Not as nice as I thought.

143
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,720
What's this?

144
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,740
Oh, shard bundle.

145
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,040
I don't know.

146
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,260
He was very useless.

147
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,910
Oh, thank you, Ben.

148
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,230
Thank you.

149
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,230
That's right, it's me, Doki Bug.

150
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,910
All right.

151
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
Got to time this.

152
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,360
Oh, shit.

153
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,640
What's he doing here?

154
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,680
All right.

155
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,120
It's fine.

156
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,280
Oh, shit!

157
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,280
That's not fine.

158
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,500
Oh, my God.

159
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,520
Please, are there any?

160
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,460
Are all chairs paid a sit?

161
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:47,380
is that the society we live in now oh my god your stupid fucking body oh my I'm leaving he wins no poor please

162
00:15:52,270 --> 00:16:00,450
capitalism reigns supreme here now I have to do this all over again I don't...

163
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:00,890

165
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,250
Okay.

166
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,730
Alright, we're just gonna skip all of that.

167
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,570
I thought you're Conrad!

168
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,330
I thought you fight against capitalism!

169
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,270
What happened?

170
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,240
Alright, let's see.

171
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,900
I don't trust myself.

172
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,660
I gotta dash through that.

173
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,420
Not comrade.

174
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,840
Seriously.

Oh, shit!

176
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,960
I looked at chat.

177
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,480
Was that obvious?

178
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,660
I looked at chat, guys.

179
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,640
Alright, here.

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,710
Okay.

181

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,900
My tiny sick legs failed me yet again.

187
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,440
I didn't focus on my leg game.

188
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,380
Oh, fuck.

189
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,740

190
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,500

I don't know where the map still is.

193
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:03,560
I would grab the map If I knew where it is guys Unfortunately I do not know

194
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:19,790
There you go Oh I need the map to find the map Exactly

195
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,740
How could you expect me to find the map when I don't have the map to help me find that map.

196
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,220
Okay, let's go try and grab our chair first.

197
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,240
I mean, of course it's on the other side.

198
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,660
Because nothing is fair in life.

199
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,110
Alright.

200
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:53,970
Okay.

201
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,270

202
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,990
Oh, look at all these paedicit benches.

227
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520

Oh, okay.

240
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,100
I really don't like these blasts.

241
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,260
This is...

242
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,980
Don't worry, it doesn't count as blasts!

243
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,740
All I have to do is go back and confess my sins, and then I shall be forgiven.

244
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,110
Oh my god.

245
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,230

For doing...

252
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,470
For making that...

253
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,450
Oh, I don't have money.

254
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,810
I have yet to be forgiven.

255
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,410
When he was risen, it was the first case of...

256
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,630
pulling yourself by your bootstrap actually working out.

257
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,690
Thank you for the chip chat, banana.

258
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,210
Thank you.

259
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,030
Thank you.

260
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,230
They never expect a second one.

261
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,330
That's why I was like that's why I played with my life there.

262
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,550
I was like, I won.

263
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,790
We can make it as close as it can get.

264
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,470
I thought I won.

265
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,190
Can I just skip that?

266
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:08,730
Yeah, I can.

267
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,970
Wait, this place is hell.

268
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,390
Now that I think about it.

269
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,990
Wait, how did I...

270
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,550
Oh, it was down here.

271
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:23,950
Okay.

272
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,610
Oh, my God.

273
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,010
Okay.

274
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,650
That was close.

275
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,150
I think it was here?

276
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,090
No, it was here.

277
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
Alright, we gotta kill these guys again.

278
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,370
Okay.

279
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,390
As long as he doesn't do that thing, we're...

280
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,410
Okay, that...

281
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,170
Oh, that's fine.

282
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,890
I was really far away.

283
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,410
There you go.

284
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,710
Okay, I hate these guys, so I'm just gonna use the magic just for him.

285
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,510
That's how much I hate you.

286
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,470
That's how much of a... of a hater I am.

287
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,510
Are you serious?

288
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,870
That hits me?

289
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,650
Alright.

290
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,910
Whoa!

291
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,330
What?!

292
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,310
Okay.

293
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,110
Jesus.

294
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,370
There you go.

295
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,330
That's the second boy.

296
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,170
The second big boy.

297
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:25,990
Are you serious?

298
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,630
He just needed to...

299
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,110
Oh my...

300
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,110
Oh, there's more!

301
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,750
Oh, my.

302
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,190
Oh, shit.

303
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,070
Please don't touch me.

304
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:38,910
Please don't touch me.

305
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,780
Please don't touch me.

306
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,660
This sucks.

307
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,680
This actually sucks.

308
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,600
Okay.

309
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,660
Nice.

310
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,840
I can't believe I died to a scripted event.

311
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,020
What's this?

312
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,880
Oh, it's the silk spool.

313
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,090
They just have more money.

314
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,570
Where am I?

315
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,370
Where am I?

316
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,070
Guys, if only I have a map.

317
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,230
Oh, man.

320
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,440
It's a crazy concept.

321
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,860
Too bad Silk Stop never added a map, guys.

322
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,090
Oh, that's true.

323
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,750

324
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,710
Please, please.

325
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,410
I can't float forever.

326
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,540
No!

327
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,770
I hate this.

328
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,760
Oh my god.

329
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,120
That's fine.

330
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,500
Get him out of here.

331
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,720
Get him out of my lobby.

332
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,460
Is there anything up here?

333
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,840
Okay, that seems like a boss, but I'm not going there yet.

334
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,820
I'll just rob some money before I die.

335
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,720
Okay.

336
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,180
Oh, my...

337
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,620
That's it.

338
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,020
That's it.

339
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,960
Oh, that doesn't matter.

340
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,280
Oh!

341
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,920
Oh!

342
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:13,860
Oh!

343
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,710
Stupid fucking flyer!

344
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,950
Oh, I hate these guys.

345
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,870
I parried so much still.

346
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:36,110
I did so many parries, but it never doesn't matter.

347
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,130
It never...

348
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,750
Oh, shit!

349
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,290
It never matters.

350
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,030
Okay, it's back here.

351
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,310
Oh, fine.

352
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,250
Okay, that's on me.

353
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,250
That's on What's a plan there?

354
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,250
I don't know.

355
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,950
I don't know There was no plan.

356
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,070
There never has been a plan.

357
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,330
Oh my god, not another one.

358
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,010
Are you serious?

359
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,710
Okay, that's fine.

360
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,630
That's fine.

361
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,490
That's fine.

362
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,910
That's fine.

363
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,930
There you go.

364
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,790
You'll anti-air them, surely.

365
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,820
I focused too much on anti-air.

366
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,560
I was like, you know what?

367
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,300
I got this.

368
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,840
I have a tool.

369
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,260
In the end, I actually don't...

370
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,980
I'm not paying to sit on that bench again.

371
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,060
I don't even have money.

372
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:42,740
Okay.

373
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,260
I don't know what was in my mind when I did that.

374
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,440
This place sucks.

375
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,520
That's all that's in my mind.

376
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,460
This place is hell.

377
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,120
Oh my god, that was so close.

378
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,280
Alright.

379
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,940
Lock in.

380
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,300
I didn't know he could jump.

381
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,100
I didn't.

382
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,440
Okay.

383
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,660
Alright.

384
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Another big boy.

385
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,030
Okay.

386
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,370
As long as I kill him, I can heal.

387
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,970
Are you serious?

388
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,750
I hit his head!

389
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,610
Okay, that's fine.

390
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,550
I'm locked in for real.

391
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,710
Don't worry, I got my London fog in my system.

392
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,790
Okay.

393
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,890
Come on, spit your thing out.

394
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,510

395
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,780

397
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,300

00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,590
Are you secret?

402
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:23,810
No!

403
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,630
That's stupid fucking...

404
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,970
That's it.

405
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,390
I need a...

406
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,770
Oh, I can't even change it.

407
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:42,670
I can't even change it because I got off the goddamn chair!

408
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,950
It's fine.

409
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,910
It works, guys.

410
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:58,890
Don't you know it?

411
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,070
Okay, I'm focused.

412
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,250
I'm struggling so much because of Liar and Big Boy.

413
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,450
That double combo.

414
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,240
Okay, I got this.

415
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,260
I got this just...

416
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,000
That's fine.

417
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,060
That's not fine.

418
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,240
That's fine.

419
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,800
Oh my god, what are you doing?

420
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,280
Did anyone get his license late?

421
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,200
See, that's fine.

422
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:36,800
It's fine.

423
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,080
Everything is okay.

424
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,340
Everything is okay.

425
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,320
Everything has gone according the plan.

426
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,440
That's good.

427
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,060
I actually needed the extra magic here.

428
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:52,620
Alright.

429
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,420
Is there a secret?

430
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,900
Why was she there?

431
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,840
Oh, she was just a gen.

432
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,000
Don't cute.

433
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,360
What do you mean why was she there?

434
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,320
She was trying to do her job.

435
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,180
Cleaning!

436
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,520
Oh wait, where does this go?

437
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,060
What?

438
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,800
There's nothing here.

439
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,820
I don't even know where to go.

440
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,460
Wow, if only this game had a map, it's crazy that they did.

441
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,240
It's actually crazy that they didn't add a map in this game, guys.

442
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,460
Can't believe it.

443
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,490
What the fuck is this?

444
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,310
It's a ghost spider.

445
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,220
Oh my god, a fucking course.

446
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,240
There was something over there.

447
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:00,850
Oh.

448
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,590
Okay.

449
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,390
Where the fuck am I?

450
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,250
Let's all go this way.

451
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:15,890
Wait.

452
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,970
Can I...

453
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,130
Oh.

454
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,010
Okay, I can.

455
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,510
What is this place?

456
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,610
Am I even supposed to be here?

457
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,590
Oh my god, I didn't see him.

458
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,510
Ghost bat.

459
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,350
Oh!

460
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:37,950
Of course.

461
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,670
Of course there's a hidden...

462
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,390
Of course there's a hidden...

463
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,170
Hidden...

464
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,810
What are they called?

465
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,050
Spinning wheels of death.

466
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,510
Oh my god, a free chair.

467
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,690
Is this a lie?

468
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,070
Are there any traps?

469
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,010
I don't believe it.

470
00:38:52,030 --> 00:39:16,580
it there's a free chair nothing comes for free through everything comes with a price i don't believe it a free chair all right how do i use two at the same time oh down rb

471
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:26,450
okay hita thank you for the super chat thingy thank you uh from here you go left to leave the city.

472
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,190
I'll go to a bell station and head to the slab.

473
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,670
Then go forward left to the cult.

474
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,230
You need that upgrade.

475
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:31,650
Okay.

476
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,930
Okay, but what about charms?

477
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:41,890
I feel like I lack a lot of charm upgrade and stuff.

478
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,970
And tools too.

479
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,630
I literally have only one charm and it's the magma shit.

480
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,770
That doesn't seem right.

481
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,510
I feel like I need more.

482
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,370
Oh hey, money.

483
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,190
I feel like this game doesn't have one charm.

484
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,740
All right, we go left.

485
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,980
Just like how this game has no map.

486
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,040
There you go.

487
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,060
We go here.

488
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,820
Oh my god, that's scary.

489
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,880
I just decided to float at the last second.

490
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,280
I was like, hmm.

491
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,880
Maybe I should start floating.

492
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,230
Well, I'd die if I flow all the way down.

493
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,510
I assume not, right?

494
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,180
Okay.

495
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,020
I assume this is how to get out.

496
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,200
Okay, there you go.

497
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,840
Alright, and this is a pilgrimage place.

498
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,420
Oh, it's a safe area.

499
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,200
Okay, nice.

500
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,320
Alright, now I can leave.

501
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,220
Where is the bell station?

502
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,200
Wait, did I?

503
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,200
Did I miss the bell station?

504
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,860
Where the fuck is the bell station here?

505
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,540
If only I have a map to tell me where it is.

506
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,260
Oh, I do.

507
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:35,490
Left?

508
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:39,570
Oh.

509
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,540
Oh, I have to go all the way back.

510
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,160
Okay.

511
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,240
Oh, yeah.

512
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,180
Where am I?

513
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,640
Oh, yeah, I took that off.

514
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,460
I was like, where am I?

515
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,100
How do I get home?

516
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,580
It's all the way over there.

517
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,680
I'll just keep going, though.

518
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,240
For five.

519
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,380
Alright, here it is.

520
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,320
I think it's here.

521
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:20,640
Yeah.

522
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,640
Okay, let's grab... I forgot I don't have my compass.

523
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,640
Let's grab that.

524
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,740
Oh.

525
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,680
Alright, where do we go?

526
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,220
Then go full left to the cold station.

527
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Okay.

528
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:49,890
Oh, wait.

529
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,210
I realized I forgot to do something.

530
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:56,830
So apparently it's like tomorrow.

531
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:57,970
Battle tomorrow.

532
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,740
And then we gotta go back Where's the prison area?

533
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,940
Oh, we can just do this.

534
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,060
Alright, so.

535
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,200
We forgot to free some people in their jail.

536
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh, so.

537
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,240
We gotta go do that real quick.

538
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,980
So we gotta save some people in jail because I forgot about them.

539
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,500
Because I thought, like, I thought, you know, I need a key because they're in jail.

540
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,960
But apparently you can just break the jail cell and I'm like, what's the point of locking them up if it's just that easy to free them?

541
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,820
And clearly their crime was not that bad if the security is that weak.

542
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,610
It's like this way?

543
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,050

627
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,930

It's okay.

629
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:44,230
It's okay.

630
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:44,950
I got...

631
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:50,770
Okay, so like, one time I was at a carnival, and there was like those shooting games where you get...

632
00:52:50,770 --> 00:53:54,890
It's like a rifle with a cork at the end, and you just got hit the target, knocked down like three targets to win a one prize like and the prize is a big ass and then there was this guy and he was surrounded by like three other girls and like you know like another bro and he's like yeah like you could tell that he had like some form like maybe like military training or some shit because when he was like shooting the when he was trying to shoot the gun it was like because like i live in canada so it's like weird that you know like it's harder to actually have like have experience holding a gun so there was this guy and then the thing is you know they're super fucking rigged and everything so like maybe like the the the the iron sight isn't um the iron sight isn't like accurate or anything on the gun itself so he looked like he was a natural with it like with how he was holding the rifle and like positioning wise and everything and he was like and and so like the first i was watching him

633
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:57,230
because I was curious because I was like, oh, it looks fun.

634
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,870
Like maybe my, does my FPS skill translate to this?

635
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:03,030
So I wanted to give it a shot.

636
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,750
And so I was waiting there.

637
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,630
And then he couldn't hit any target.

638
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:14,310
He didn't hit, he only hit one target after, like, because you get five shots and he only hit one.

639
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:19,110
So then he's like, okay, I'm going to try again because, you know, all the girls were around him and he was like, I got to show off.

640
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:20,730
And so like, I was like, all right.

641
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:23,790
And then like, and then he kept missing.

642
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:50,930
it but he was at that point it was over he was determined like he was like so he had like an ego to prove at that point so i was like okay this guy this guy's gonna take a while uh i was like bros yeah bros gotta risk like like you know all the ladies were watching him and he's like i gotta i gotta prove myself at that point he didn't want to embarrass himself so so i was Like,

643
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:55,130
okay, I'll just come back, because I feel like he's going to be here for a while.

644
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:04,330
And then, so I left, literally for 30 minutes, and then I came back, because I really wanted to try this carnival game.

645
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:10,430
And then he was still there, but he took off his jacket, because you know he was serious now.

646
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:16,870
But he did win one time, because one of the girls was carrying a giant ass stuffed toy now.

647
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,750
So then, but I think he wanted, but he didn't want it to win for all the girls.

648
00:55:20,770 --> 00:56:43,610
and so like so like I was watching again because I was like surely like he'll like be done with this right so then I watched a little bit and you know he would hit the shots but then he'll miss like one target and so I was like okay I'll come back again I'll wait another hour and so like I came back another hour the girls now have three giant plushies but he was still there he was still he paying this carnival game more money I don't even know what the point was anymore I was like all the girls got their big ass plushie why it's still here it was trying to fight it was personal now bro had a mission it's about the message it's a good thing Kat that doesn't get into wars that main thing it was for the love of the game so that was like so i was like okay i'll come back when it's closing time so maybe by then he'll be god and then literally i came back and that guy was still trying to shoot targets i don't understand how all like him and his friend group were like like his friend group

649
00:56:43,610 --> 00:58:17,710
were just okay with that like it was like he was there for two and a half hours i swear and then finally i just waited because i was like okay it's 30 minutes till closing time surely he'll leave and then eventually he actually finally left and i was just like oh my god i was like this man because it was like i think it was like 15 it was 15 per play i swear to god that carnival game farmed like 500 off of this man like at least five hundred dollars off of him like because i bet you in his head he's like he's like he's like um i went to military for this why can't i hit the target i even went to military school what's the point of joining the army if i can't hit this stupid ass paper target what the carnies were big he's like i went to war but yet i can't even hit this toddy at that stupid ass paper target with a fucking corkscrew gun like he must be military we're stupid with money like thank you with a super chat thank you thank you

01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,750
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

677
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:34,730
Thank you, thank you.

678
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:37,010

01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:37,750
Thank you, thank you.

01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,250

01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:47,310
I gotta win us the giant ass Lafoo-foo doll, guys.

683
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,370
Look, I might have spent $500.

684
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:59,150
And the Lafoufou cost $5 on Timu, but you don't understand.

685
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:05,810
The Boolet, the Lafoufou on Timu doesn't have the same...

686
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:12,510
The same aura as winning it from a carnival game.

687
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:13,530
You don't understand.

688
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:15,470
It's about the experience.

689
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:19,150
You have a memory from it.

690
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,250
We tell that story.

691
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:30,070
All right, I have enough.

692
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,110
It's a story.

693
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:34,750
It's a momento.

694
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,850
All right, I got this.

695
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,250
All right.

696
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:48,750
Low and steady.

697
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:52,510

I see you have a tool pouch of your own there.

701
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,690
Bold, bursting with bubbles and trinkets, no doubt.

702
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:12,070
I'll fit another pocket onto it so you can carry even more tools and shards with you.

703
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,330
A fair prize, wouldn't you say?

I got my tool pouch expanded.

706
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,750
We can play Hit the Target and you'll earn yourself a beautiful necklace of rosaries.

707
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:23,390
Oh, my God.

708
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,130

Can I owe you $25?

712
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,450
Wait, it's more?

713
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:33,590
Oh, wait, no, it was always $25.

714
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,230
I was going to say.

715
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:35,610
That's good.

716
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,170
It's not over yet.

717
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,890
No, it's over.

718
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:44,490
They're just giving me money.

719
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:48,030
Like, I feel like the net is not going to be a net positive.

720
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:55,470
I feel like I might spend more than I make from it.

721
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,450
Just a theory.

722
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:16,120

724
01:04:37,890 --> 01:06:01,080
it steps I was in the wait where was that was I in the okay I was in the underworks what the fuck is dead locks bell bottom oh deep docks I don't know why I said dead lock I've been watching I've been watching I was watching a dead lock stream today I swear does dead looks look uglier like did they did they make the game uglier i swear it's so like i feel like there's like actual no shaders or lighting applied to the game for the newest update but everyone's saying it's like a lot better now but i swear to god it looked like it it looked a little it looked like uglier than what i feel like i'm not sure if it's because all the streamers turned their graphics to low but but like there's like i feel like it's just there's no shade like the the map for deadlock had less color i was so surprised like how could it have less color like i think i think i think like all the streamers i was watching for deadlock was playing on the lowest graphics possible because because there was actually it

725
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,440
felt like there was like it was and brown in an entire map.

726
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,480
Uh, okay.

727
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:18,240

728
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:19,520

729
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:20,100
This?

730
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,880
Oh, you mean this.

731
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:22,780
This area.

732
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,940
Oh, you want me to go here!

733
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:25,700
Okay.

734
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,600
Right?

735
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,120
Is that what you want me to go to?

736
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:33,760
Here?

737
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:39,270
There's no Hold on, or is it here?

738
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,190
Oh, here!

739
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:43,050
Okay.

740
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,170
What is up there?

741
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:47,850
Alright, where am I?

742
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:49,430
I'll just bell it.

743
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:54,730
Alright.

744
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,010
Ducks.

745
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,210
Matio, they give us Super Chat.

746
01:06:59,290 --> 01:06:59,470
Thank you.

747
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:05,690
An optional cell version of an area?

748
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:06,390
Wait.

749
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:12,790
Is that version supposed to be easier or not easy?

750
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:17,970
Because if they're trying to trick me into going to a harder part, doing a harder version.

751
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:21,890
I know lucky.

752
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,290
No, it's so much harder.

753
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,350
Okay, chat's fighting again.

754
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:37,150
Some people say it's harder and others are saying it's easier.

755
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,580
Wait, why stealth?

756
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,040
I hate stealth.

757
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,960
Why are you making me do stealth?

758
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,460
I hate stealth.

759
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:04,680
Oh my god, I'm getting beat up by a child right now because I'm looking at chat.

760
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,460
It's funnier?

761
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,720
How much funnier, though?

762
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,700
Alright.

763
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:26,940
Very funny.

764
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:28,440
Okay.

765
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:29,360
Alright.

766
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,940
For reasons of funny, I'll head over.

767
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:34,900
Oh my god.

768
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:35,600
Okay, it's fine.

769
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,160
Alright, we'll go there.

770
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,780
Alright, let's heal up for there.

771
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:49,040
Yeah?

772
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,480
Wait, why does he have a cage?

773
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:56,760
Okay.

774
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:57,720
Oh.

775
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,440
Is he trying to kidnap me?

776
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,760
Wait a minute.

777
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,680
Wait, there's a person in there.

778
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,580
Wait a minute.

779
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:10,420
Wait a minute.

780
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,160
Wait a minute.

781
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,580
All right, give me a sec.

782
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,340
I gotta grab some silk real quick.

783
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,760
I'm not here to get caged.

784
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,280
I've avoided authorities long enough.

785
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,880
I ain't going back

786
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:43,690
He just wants to sell me What does this sell me something?

787
01:09:43,890 --> 01:10:01,490
I think he's gonna sell me I ain't going back They can't get me I avoided the authorities lying enough They won't get me for my crimes I've confessed They said it They said if I confess I get to be free

788
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:34,230
I confess for my crimes They said if I confess That everything would be forgiven Oh my god No Let me out Let me out Time Time I have to do my time now Time Caged for my crimes.

789
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,500
Wait, am I naked?

790
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,780
Oh my god!

791
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,340
It's super jail!

792
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,640
They actually dug my clothes!

793
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,120
Oh my god, I'm in super jail!

794
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,340
I have

795
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:01,970
clothes!

796
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:07,430
Oh my god, I gotta put some meat on my bones.

797
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:09,490
I'm so skinny, no wonder.

798
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,490
Can I still jump?

799
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,210
Okay.

800
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:13,930
Where the fuck do I go?

801
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,230
Oh my god, I got my legs, though.

802
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:16,070
Ha, ha.

803
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,910
Go off with the Mark Heretic.

804
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,710
This is now an 18th place.

805
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:26,150
I heard that you can mod your...

806
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,050
Oh my god, I can't fly.

807
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:28,550
I forgot I can't fly.

808
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,430
They actually took my robes, too.

809
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:35,950
I heard that they made a mod where you can be naked the entire time.

810
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:41,170
It was like literally one of the first mods they made.

811
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:50,790
Other than taking away the minus 2 damage, being naked was the very first mod they've ever made for this game.

812
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,040
Where do I go?

813
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,200
I'm just naked.

814
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,340
I'm naked and free.

815
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,140
It's time to do my time.

816
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,200
Time to pay for the crimes I've committed.

817
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:14,940
What?

818
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,620
Where do I go?

819
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:22,860
Let

820
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:28,380

821
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,720
Let me in!

822
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,460

Thank you, thank you.

01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,760
Curvy so soft from all the fan art.

826
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,000
Room below ceiling.

827
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,900
Down, left, up.

828
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:52,600

829
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,880

01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,630

Okay, never a mile, never, I can never tell.

01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:50,080
It's like, it's like a pantheon raid, but for my robes.

836
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,280
Okay, there must be a way to get up there.

837
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,020
Oh, I'm so cold, I'm so cold!

838
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,800
Oh no, I'm so cold!

839
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,210
Wait, can I like parry?

840
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:11,190
Oh my god, I can't parry that.

841
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:14,730
I can't imagine I parry it with my feet

842
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:28,910
Can I go here?

843
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,150
I'm so good.

844
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:33,690
I'm so good

845
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,870
Where am I?

846
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:41,570
Hello?

847
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,590
You're looking a little stuck here.

848
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:46,110
What a pity.

849
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,350
We meet again, little thief.

850
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:50,030
Are you familiar with this place?

851
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:54,890
If we ally our efforts, our escape could be made that much easier.

852
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,190
Oh, you just think?

853
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:58,970
There are no allies in prison.

854
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:03,830
You can just throw yourself against the wall in there while I go sniffing for goodies.

855
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:05,790
Oh, my God, you asshole.

856
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,670
Just because I freed you.

857
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:12,530
What's this?

858
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:23,870
Please, oh my god, I can't, I'm so weak, my legs, I didn't do leg day.

859
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:32,200
It's not fair, I skipped leg day.

860
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:39,420
Eh.

861
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,920
I mean, do I even have money down there?

862
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,820
I feel like I was like extra broke.

863
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,500
I never skipped leg day.

864
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:49,880
day.

865
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,620
How was I supposed to know?

866
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,360
Oh my god.

867
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:04,570
Okay.

868
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:06,630

869
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:07,710

870
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:14,650
Is it this?

871
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:17,470
Oh yeah, there it is.

872
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:18,230
Nice.

873
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:28,330

Oh, shit.

878
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:05,620
Unlucky.

879
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:06,940
Can I heal from this?

880
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:07,580
Oh, you can.

881
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,200
It's true.

882
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:15,120
Oh, it's this place again.

883
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:18,840
Oh, it's this place again.

884
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,780
Oh, it's this place.

885
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:20,520
What the fuck?

886
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,660
Where am I supposed to go?

887
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:26,910
There's nothing here.

888
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:29,270
Oh.

889
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:31,230
Oh.

890
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:31,410
Oh.

891
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:31,570
Oh.

892
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,010
All right.

893
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:35,310
Am I supposed to go right?

894
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:36,290
No, okay.

895
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:37,870
Uh?

896
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:42,110
Wait, do I have all the keys needed?

897
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,090
I don't have the heretic key though.

898
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,150
Or maybe to the right side.

899
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,120
Okay.

900
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,180
I gotta find another key.

901
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,900
I don't know about how many keys I...

902
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,240
Is this key where?

903
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:09,400
Apostate.

904
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,200
Wasn't that a...

905
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,380
This was Heretic, right?

906
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,180
Okay, I don't have Heretic.

907
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,760
What other doors are there?

908
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:25,290
Hello?

909
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:28,550
Oh wait, this is new?

910
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:31,510
Oh, I didn't realize there's a...

911
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,150
Oh wait, this is where I came from.

912
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:33,610
Okay.

913
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,470
There's a chair here.

914
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:38,130
Oh, there you are.

915
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:39,550
That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass.

Get over here.

917
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:42,510
At least give me clothes.

918
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:48,730
Why, we thought one of them buzzing bullies was sneaking up on us, but it's just a mangy gel bug.

919
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,330

924
01:18:56,970 --> 01:19:00,010
Rather, I suspect the warden and their servants of the Citadel.

925
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:04,850
The cage used in my capture bore similar runes to the one that first brought me to this land.

926
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:10,550
Beyond, found in that cage, I've proven fine gift where they do deliver me to their master.

01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:08,230
I don't know where he's been.

1021
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:10,690
It doesn't even look like he's showered in a while, too.

1022
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:12,590
It's fine.

1023
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:13,750

I got the key of Herodic.

1027
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:25,960
That's what we need it.

1028
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:26,880
Oh, nice chair.

1029
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:28,520
Okay, now.

1030
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,860
Now where the fuck am I?

1031
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,000
What the slag?

1032
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,120
Yeah, use it.

1033
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,320
Wait, I can read a description of my cloak.

1034
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,580
What happened to it?

1035
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:46,720
How?

1036
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,840
I don't know.

1037
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:49,540
Oh, wait, here.

1038
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:52,060
Oh, no.

1039
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,920
Ah, he got fly all over my cloak.

1040
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:24,900
gross oh shit all my Chris got reset too they took away my Chris too ah you know okay you know like when flies do the rubbing together thing you see this the flies do the rubbing their hands together they actually like vomit on their hands while they're rubbing it that's what they're doing when they're eating they actually like vomit out they vomit and then like put it back in their face.

1041
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,160
I don't know why they do it.

1042
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:27,180
I just, that's all I remember.

1043
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:39,040
I don't know exactly why they have to do that to fucking eat, but, but they always, they like, they like vomit into their hands, and that's why they're always rubbing it.

1044
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:40,980
I don't know fucking, oh, it's to digest it.

1045
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:41,180
Yeah.

1046
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:41,900
Oh yeah, yeah.

1047
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:42,880
It's to digest it.

1048
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:45,720
It's to digest the food better, to soften it up.

1049
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,980
So, I technically have bug vomit on my robe now.

1050
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:56,740
And that is That is why I snapped his neck.

1051
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,540
That is why I was justified to snap his neck.

1052
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,420
Was I using Wunderer?

1053
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,480
Wait, what was the...

1054
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,280
Oh, it's Reaper.

1055
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:04,720
Oh, my God.

1056
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,620
They reset the Reaper as well.

1057
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:09,140
Reset everything.

1058
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:11,180
Okay.

1059
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:12,660
Adidas.

1060
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,760
Alright, I need compass, this, magma.

1061
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,700
The more you know.

1062
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:22,340
Alright.

1063
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,720
Now where do I go?

1064
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:34,060
Okay, now there's no way I can be that cold now.

1065
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,840
I have the heretic thing.

1066
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,980
Can I unlock anything?

1067
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,080
Maybe all the way down?

1068
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:53,140
Oh yeah, so technically they're spitting their stomach acid into me right now.

1069
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,620
They're actually projectile vomiting at me.

1070
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,160
Okay.

1071
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,240
Oh, technically, yeah.

1072
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,340
I'll feed him up just for the money.

1073
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,180
I need the money.

1074
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:14,560
Wait, I hear him.

1075
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,500
Oh, he's in here.

1076
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,160
I hear the little dog fly.

1077
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,120
The dog flea.

1078
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:31,910
Okay, downtime.

1079
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:35,610
Oh, is this heretic?

1080
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:37,630
Oh, I got heretic.

1081
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:39,650
Yay!

1082
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:42,050
I'm a heretic.

1083
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,710
Uh, open sesame.

1084
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:51,610
Guess I'll go left.

1085
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:57,690
Oh, wait, nice.

1086
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:58,750
There's a bell station.

1087
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:01,330
Alright, let's go to that bell station.

1088
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:04,050
So this way.

1089
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,870
Hello, little baby.

1090
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:10,770
Goodbye, little baby.

1091
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:15,830
Where's the bell station?

1092
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,810
What the fuck were you doing with that big boy?

1093
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:19,370
Huh?

1094
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,310
What were you doing?

1095
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:21,690
Huh?

1096
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:23,470
Interacting with that prisoner there?

1097
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:24,850
Colluding with the prisoner?

1098
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:28,270
Oh my, I told you.

1099
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:29,270
I told you.

1100
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:30,970
These flies down there.

1101
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:32,890
They're BBB and joyers.

1102
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:34,270
I told you.

1103
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:34,690
you.

1104
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,980
Oh, oh, oh, that still does damage to me?

1105
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:50,760
Having a little private time there.

1106
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:56,430
Okay, the bell is here.

1107
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:58,450
Do I have money?

1108
01:30:58,710 --> 01:30:59,710
God damn, I don't.

1109
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:01,390
I like $40.

1110
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:07,930

1111
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:27,530
Don't kick shame them let them be free oh my god look at this oh my god i it's like a girl in closet watch

Bugs!

1114
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:44,790
Give me your money.

1115
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:48,950
Oh, they don't even have money because they don't get paid in cash.

1116
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:52,170
They get paid in giant ass bugs.

1117
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:52,970
Rude!

1118
01:31:58,770 --> 01:31:59,330
Alright.

1119
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:01,170
I need like $40.

1120
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:08,010
I forgot how slow the Reaper is though.

1121
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:11,990
Are you running?

1122
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:13,870
There we go.

1123
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:19,190
Oh my god, more shard bundles.

1124
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:20,290
It feels useless.

1125
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:22,850
Did I have...

1126
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:23,430
Oh, shit.

1127
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:25,750
Let's try to see if I have 40 yet.

1128
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:28,530
How much do I have?

1129
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:31,930
Oh, I do.

1130
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:32,390
Okay.

1131
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:34,770
Wait, is it 40 or 80?

1132
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,170
I was technically not reading.

1133
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,430
No, I'll use my tools.

1134
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:43,710
Oh, fuck, that wasn't a tool.

1135
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:46,690
I'm gonna do it.

1136
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:50,410
Freaky-ass bugs.

1137
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,590
It was 40.

1138
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:52,250
Okay, good.

1139
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:55,390
Because I wasn't actually reading.

1140
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:57,210
Alright.

1141
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,180
Yay!

1142
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:14,150
Alright.

1143
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:15,750
Come in, come in!

1144
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:16,630
Come in, boy!

1145
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:19,190
Oh, wait.

1146
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,130
He doesn't show up yet.

1147
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:20,430
Oh, wait.

1148
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:22,370
I should go to the chair first and get full HP.

1149
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:25,150
I almost forgot about the chair.

1150
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:29,910
Okay, go left.

1151
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:34,810
Surely now that I have my clothes, I won't freeze, right?

1152
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,610
Oh, no, I'm still freezing.

1153
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:39,230
I have!

1154
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:41,330
Oh, it's because I didn't put my pants on.

1155
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,010
It's because...

1156
01:33:43,010 --> 01:33:46,870
It's because Jane Silk Song isn't wearing pants.

1157
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:47,870
God damn it.

1158
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:49,870
What do I do?

1159
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:53,690
I'm so good.

1160
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:58,090
I'm so good.

1161
01:33:58,430 --> 01:33:59,570
Oh my god, I might die!

1162
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:00,970
Oh my god, I'm gonna freeze!

1163
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:10,070
That's it, Keita.

1164
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:12,890
You lost your backseeing privilege.

1165
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:17,490
You let me freeze to death.

1166
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:26,330
How did you forget that I have no pants on?

1167
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:29,990
All right.

1168
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,550
Nominate a new backseater for me.

1169
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,030
It's time.

1170
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:43,750
Elect a new backseater.

1171
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:46,770
The council elect a new backseater.

1172
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:50,470
Thank you.

1173
01:34:50,610 --> 01:34:51,670
I think it was super chat.

1174
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:52,130
Thank you.

1175
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:52,830
Thank you.

1176
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:56,190
All right, where do we go?

1177
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:02,050
There's cool stuff in the first area?

1178
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:04,270
You mean, da moro?

1179
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,240
All right, where do we go now, guys?

1180
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:21,040
We're still doing the filler episode.

1181
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,000
Deep dock, so you have... I don't have a key.

1182
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,120
I have no key.

1183
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,140
Alright, guys.

1184
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,400
Now I'm lost.

1185
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:38,940
Are I done any?

1186
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,300
Wait, where am I, actually?

1187
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,200
Oh, wait.

1188
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:48,040
It's bone bottom, not tomorrow.

1189
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,300
Back to the hunters' march for a very useful item.

1190
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:56,920
Where's the useful item?

1191
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,140
I should get rid of these.

1192
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,100

Down right.

Oh, this way.

1203
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:31,070
I'm sorry, they all look like evil witches.

1204
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:34,910
Like, did you not see your hunchback?

1205
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:38,630
She looked so... She looked like a witch.

1206
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:41,210
Made me want to burn her.

1207
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:44,370
You want to be like, burn the witch.

1208
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:47,650
Wait, how many...

1209
01:37:47,650 --> 01:37:47,910
Wait.

1210
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:50,890
Alright.

1211
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:52,070
This way.

1212
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:57,070
This is the door.

1213
01:37:57,070 --> 01:38:03,890

Hello.

1216
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:10,370
The Atlas.

1217
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:12,130
What's wrong with this guy?

1218
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:14,870
Why is he just looking at me like that?

1219
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:19,370
That's the worst security of- wait, what?

1220
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:24,590
The worst security system they have.

1221
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:31,800
Anyone here?

1222
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:35,540
Oh, it's like...

1223
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:36,660
Oh, it's a puzzle!

1224
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:38,340
I did it!

1225
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,420
I completed a puzzle!

1226
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,640
Oh my god, guys, I'm so smart.

1227
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:45,820
I completed the hardest puzzle in this game.

1228
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:48,460
I ruined depicting the weave nest.

1229
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:49,880
Yeah, I'll take the map.

1230
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,080
What a hard puzzle.

1231
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,900
Oh, there's something below.

1232
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:57,960
Oh, I start...

1233
01:38:58,540 --> 01:38:59,460
on the power.

1234
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,880
It's on the right.

1235
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,220
Okay, gotta hit down.

1236
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:19,710
Hello, anybody here?

1237
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:21,730
Hello?

1238
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:24,050
Who's there?

1239
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:26,070
Has someone come to free me?

1240
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:28,190
Or are you here to bring my end?

1241
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:30,530
I am hornet, prisoner.

1242
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:33,190
Only a traveler are not here to slay you.

1243
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:37,770
What cause sees you cage in these ruins of Weaver's past?

1244
01:39:38,090 --> 01:40:38,950

One not without cost.

1246
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:46,510
My sight perceives a bug only through the imprint upon their soul.

1247
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:48,690
You speak of their crest.

1248
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:54,250
That signifies of a bug's essence, an invisible yoke born through a lifetime.

1249
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:55,950
Crest?

1250
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:58,410
Yes, the old weaver term.

1251
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:02,970
A simple word to attempt description of something so refined.

1252
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:06,690
But wait, your own nature, is it?

1257
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:55,460

1258
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:56,680
Oh, okay.

01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,720

Alright.

1263
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,320
Why don't I just free her?

1264
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:08,600
Why am I keeping her cage like this?

1265
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:13,270
Alright.

1266
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:15,910

Can you roll it down?

1272
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:29,990
Okay, I don't like that.

1273
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:31,250
I like that.

1274
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,110
Oh, he's tired.

1275
01:44:32,730 --> 01:44:33,270
He's eepy.

1276
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:37,190
Okay, yeah, I can just kill it like that.

1277
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:40,330
There we go.

1278
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:42,450
I don't know what that is, though.

1279
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:44,750
He's a big boy.

1280
01:44:46,810 --> 01:44:48,090
Can you think below me?

1281
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:54,840
What's over here?

1282
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:57,940
Oh, this was like...

1283
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:58,960
Oh, I could have...

1284
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,800
Oh, that was a shortcut.

1285
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,280
Oh, I see.

1286
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:08,160
I see.

1287
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,860
I could have just like...

1288
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:16,220
Like, if I don't want to...

1289
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:18,160
If I don't want to do the...

1290
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:21,140
Do the parkour, I just kill him.

1291
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:27,740
He's going to use this for now.

1292
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:29,000
Oh, I forgot.

1293
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:29,960
I'm not a Reaper now.

1294
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:32,080
I have to do diagonal jumps.

1295
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,460
I guess they're all like little shortcut.

1296
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,580
Like, up is shortcut?

1297
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,220
What is down?

1298
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:44,060
Down is nothing.

1299
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:45,600
Guys, I fucked up.

1300
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,660
It was nothing.

1301
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:50,080
Thank God I could jump from there.

1302
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,020
What's this?

1303
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,580
Oh, this is a boss fight.

1304
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:56,320
Oh, it's you.

1305
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,160
I killed you before.

1306
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,080
Wait, you're a Moss Mother, but I killed you.

1307
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,700
How are you still alive?

1308
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:07,280
I killed you.

1309
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:08,480
Whoops.

1310
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:10,260
Let's fuck it.

1311
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:11,700
Let's...

1312
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:15,000
I need to remember that I can only...

1313
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,580
I can jump.

1314
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:16,860
Oh, never...

1315
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:18,080
Oh, my God, Moss Father!

1316
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:19,540
Oh, my God!

1317
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,480
It's Moss Mother and Moss Father!

1318
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,140
Okay, this one...

1319
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:30,940
Sex.

1320
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:34,840
There's too many.

1321
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,460
There's too many.

1322
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:38,540
There's too many things on my screen!

1323
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:47,970
Oh, my god, not the...

1324
01:46:47,970 --> 01:46:51,690
You guys know when there's too many things on my screen, I can't focus!

1325
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:53,330
I can't focus!

1326
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:58,610
Oh my god.

1327
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:12,890
How...

1328
01:47:12,890 --> 01:47:13,690
Look at this.

1329
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:20,150
How are you still alive?!

1330
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:32,550
I feel like I did so much damage.

1331
01:47:40,090 --> 01:47:40,970
Moss Mother dead.

1332
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:42,650
Time to kill the dad.

1333
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:51,160
Alright.

1334
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,480
There we go.

1335
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,140
Moss Mother and Moss Father dead.

1336
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:57,120
I killed a family.

1337
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:57,760
Let's go.

1338
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,180
Thank God.

1339
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,940
I'll make sure no one will remember them.

1340
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:05,820
Hey, weevlet.

1341
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,360

1342
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:10,360

1346
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:17,920
Thank God.

1347
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,320
I hope they're unmarked graves.

1348
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,940
No one's gonna remember who they were.

1349
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:23,870
How do I...

1350
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,000
Wait, there's something up here.

1351
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,620

1352
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,760

1375
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:15,120
I'll talk to how many hours is this game?

1376
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:21,580
Well, like, apparently there's an achievement where the speedrunner achievement for this game is to complete a hundred...

1377
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:25,260
It's that 100% this in under 30 hours.

1378
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:28,080
Like, that's the speedrunner achievement.

1379
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:34,060
I was like, 100% in under 30 hours.

1380
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:35,920
Like, what the fuck?

1381
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:41,100
The fact that they call that the speed part.

1382
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:42,700
Yeah.

1383
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:52,800
What is the security camera?

1384
01:50:58,270 --> 01:50:59,050
Oh, there's more.

1385
01:51:00,630 --> 01:51:01,030
Noink.

1386
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,790
Runeheart.

1387
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:04,270
Oh, okay.

1388
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:05,030
It's just money.

1389
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:11,930
I'm sure it's gonna take me a while to complete this.

1390
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:26,910
this i don't think i'm 100 it's gonna take me so long for 100 this low her gaze escape prepare sisters we've hope anew that we might break free this accursed web born of our native foundation

1391
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:45,710
has anyone figured out the true ending yet like what is considered the true ending is that the one after act three i assume act three after act three is the true Oh, hidden wall to there, right?

1392
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:48,270
Oh, okay.

1393
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:52,990
Nice.

1394
01:51:57,170 --> 01:51:57,450
Whoa!

1395
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:01,010
Oh my god, I got you!

1396
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:05,150
Okay, we spare.

1397
01:52:05,730 --> 01:52:07,230
I thought he'd stop.

1398
01:52:08,450 --> 01:52:11,170
He's like, got you, got you again!

1399
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:14,510
Okay, why did you go back?

1400
01:52:14,610 --> 01:52:16,710
I thought he would stop!

1401
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:19,930
I thought he'd leave afterwards!

1402
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:24,990
I didn't think he'd do it again!

1403
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:29,410
I swear, I've died to it on minions instead of the bosses.

1404
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:35,750
What the fuck?

1405
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:37,710
I was gonna say, why can't I...

1406
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:38,670
I'm just gonna leave.

1407
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,820
You ain't tricky.

1408
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:47,180
me.

1409
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,440
You're not tricking me.

1410
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:50,020
You're not tricking me.

1411
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,020
I know what that place is.

1412
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,340
I know exactly what that place is.

1413
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:02,280
I know.

1414
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:04,800
You fool me once.

1415
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:06,880
Shame on you.

1416
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:13,700
I know exactly what that place is.

1417
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:25,260
That's that's not a boss area trust us yeah sure sure

1418
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:40,360
i swear to god if this is a beast fly part two i swear to god

1419
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:56,420
I know what the arena looks like.

1420
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:57,960
I've seen it.

1421
01:53:58,060 --> 01:54:01,280
I know exactly what the arena looks like.

1422
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,820
Doki, I promise you.

1423
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:06,400
It's just platforming for a mad start.

1424
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:08,420
Bad me if I'm lying.

1425
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:10,820
Fox, thank you for the super chat.

1426
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:11,960
Thank you.

1427
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,440
I'll Aka if it's...

1428
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:19,060
Oh, shit.

1429
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:19,920
I'm not looking.

1430
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:23,680
I'll Aka if it's peaceful.

1431
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:24,380
I trust.

1432
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:25,800
It is not there.

1433
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:26,600
I swear to God.

1434
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:27,480
I swear to God.

1435
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:31,700
If I go there and it's like Beast Fly in Part 2.

1436
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,900
I swear to God.

1437
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:38,620
If the Beast Fly shows up.

1438
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:40,000
I swear to God.

1439
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:43,200
I know what the arena looks like.

1440
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:46,900
Okay.

1441
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:50,240
There it comes.

1442
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:50,660
Okay.

1443
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:53,680
Oh my.

1444
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:56,100
My god, okay, this area, this area sucks.

1445
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:58,740
But, okay.

1446
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:14,810
Okay, might not have been smart to go into this area with, like, already a lack of HP.

1447
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:22,180
Oh, wait, nice.

1448
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:23,060
There's the map chart.

1449
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:23,840
Oh, thank god.

1450
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:24,680
Okay.

1451
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:27,100
You guys win this time.

1452
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:33,120
Look, I have trust issues, okay?

1453
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:37,420
Doesn't help.

1454
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:37,820
Don't!

1455
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:38,140
Fuck!

1456
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,280
Alright, nice.

1457
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,200
What are these little security cameras, anyway?

1458
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,540
Like, I feel like they do nothing.

1459
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:51,320
They just look at me.

1460
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:52,560
Like...

1461
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:55,340
What is their purpose?

1462
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:03,470
Like, what is your purpose?

1463
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:06,750
Oh, they're lights?

1464
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:08,610
I don't even need lights.

1465
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:12,690
I thought they were, like, some shitty-ass T-Moo security.

1466
01:56:12,710 --> 01:56:13,710
security system.

1467
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:23,420
Alright.

1468
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:33,020
They're always watching me.

1469
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:40,480
Like, you know it's from Timu because like all it does is, wait, where do I go?

1470
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,040
I gotta go this way.

1471
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:49,340
All it does, it just pings you and be like, there's this person outside.

1472
01:56:49,360 --> 01:57:04,060
your house and that's it that's the security they're just like hey there might be someone outside your house and that's it they don't call anybody they just send you a text message you don't even give you a photo it's just literally a

1473
01:57:07,390 --> 01:57:16,710
text okay so where does the witch live I don't remember where she lives there might be

1474
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:24,180
Gladstone.

1475
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:25,320
Thank you for the super chat.

1476
01:57:25,460 --> 01:57:26,260
Thank you, thank you.

1477
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:28,540
And that's why I have trust issues.

1478
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:30,500
I keep getting one guide.

1479
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:31,920
Oh, hey, there's a new guy here.

1480
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,960
You and the cloak.

1481
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:35,240
Pray tread softly.

1482
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:38,840
I meditate and gather my faith before my pilgrimage begins.

1483
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,540
My steps are softened up, madam.

1484
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:43,700
If I disturb you, it was not my intent.

1485
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:47,260
Even your speech far too loud.

1486
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,240
I can scarcely hear my thoughts.

1487
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:50,780
Please be away.

1488
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:51,340
Okay.

1489
01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:52,720
Down the elevator.

1490
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:53,460
All right.

1491
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,220
Upper right.

1492
01:57:58,920 --> 01:57:59,280
Yeah?

1493
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:01,100
And then where do I go?

1494
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:03,020
Does she live here?

1495
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,960
I like the other guy, but...

1496
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:11,520
Well, he's fucking dead.

1497
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:12,980
It's his own fault, though.

1498
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:15,920
Shouldn't I wish for that beast to die.

1499
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:19,420
That bench in the top right...

1500
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:19,840
Oh!

1501
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:20,860
Oh!

1502
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,000
That's where she lives.

1503
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:22,500
Okay.

1504
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:24,620
And it's his fault.

1505
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:25,420
He's the one...

1506
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:26,880
He made his wish.

1507
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:29,920
Not my fault, the monkey paw curled.

1508
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:32,320
Okay.

1509
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,420
This way.

1510
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:43,180
Uh, all the way to the right.

1511
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:49,900
Okay, and then we gotta go right side.

1512
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:51,680
Ooh!

1513
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:52,940
Oh, shit.

1514
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,140
You know what?

1515
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:56,840
I got, I need some money anyway.

1516
01:58:58,100 --> 01:58:58,580
Okay.

1517
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:03,200
Oh, hey, money.

1518
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:05,540
Yay!

1519
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:07,160
They don't need that.

1520
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:08,420
The pilgrims don't need it.

1521
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:09,220
They're...

1522
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:10,620
They're... to make the pilgrimage.

1523
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:11,220
They gotta...

1524
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:15,260
They gotta let go of all prized possessions and money.

1525
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:21,740
And that... And I'm so generous to take it away from them.

1526
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,860
So generous of me.

1527
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:26,460
Oh, there she is.

1528
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:31,730
Hello, I grabbed it.

1529
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:34,390
As promised, Druid, I have your berries.

1530
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:37,530
What is your need for such common fruits?

1531
01:59:38,750 --> 01:59:38,870
Common?

1532
01:59:39,330 --> 01:59:40,030
No, no.

1533
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:41,150
Special.

1534
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:42,310
Cherish.

1535
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:44,410
Only a druid knows it.

1536
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:47,210
The berry's bright for my wish.

1537
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:49,310
My wish is so dear.

1538
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:51,750
All right, here's your moss berry.

1539
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:54,390
This is them.

1540
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:56,550
The precious promised fruits.

1541
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:57,930
Drop them in.

1542
01:59:58,050 --> 01:59:58,810
There they go.

1543
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:01,270
last we can begin.

1544
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:02,510
Alright.

1545
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:03,310
Yay!

1546
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:05,850
What do I get?

1547
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:07,610
Whoa!

1548
02:00:11,210 --> 02:00:14,930
Oh, the smell is red like the others, but they're young.

1549
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:16,970
Oh, voices of the woods.

1550
02:00:17,390 --> 02:00:19,070
Oh, dance of the queen.

1551
02:00:19,570 --> 02:00:20,730
Oh, beat harder.

1552
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:22,170
Let us hear it.

1553
02:00:22,610 --> 02:00:23,410
Oh, oh.

1554
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:28,110
Does she make my special goo-goo juice?

1555
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:31,430
Like from honey boo-boo?

1556
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:34,710
The pain.

1557
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:36,090
My mind aches.

1558
02:00:36,410 --> 02:00:36,750
White.

1559
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:37,450
The berries.

1560
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:38,630
The nasty fruits.

1561
02:00:38,970 --> 02:00:40,230
Oh, the vision.

1562
02:00:42,570 --> 02:00:42,990
You.

1563
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:44,090
Wish-promiser.

1564
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:45,470
Wish-granted.

1565
02:00:45,990 --> 02:00:49,730
You brought me what I needed and stayed by my side.

1566
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:52,190
Yeah, it just took me like maybe 12 hours.

1567
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:53,430
I got a little sidetracked.

1568
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:55,650
Companion threw my idea.

1569
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:58,490

02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:36,730
I feel like druid eye might be better.

1573
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:37,770

1625
02:07:22,090 --> 02:07:24,630
I forgot how annoying the stick bugs are.

1626
02:07:26,030 --> 02:07:27,490
Are there any of them here?

1627
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:30,510
There's not one.

1628
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:32,030
Who told me to go left?

1629
02:07:33,910 --> 02:07:34,610

1634
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:58,380

1635
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:01,100
I gotta do this stupid parkour shit again.

1636
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:08,660
They're all on the right side.

1637
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:09,600
side of the map.

1638
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:12,220
Okay, thank god I'm on the right side, guys.

1648
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,680
Oh, it's the lost courier.

1649
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,620
It's this lost package.

1650
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:34,760
This Amazon delivery didn't arrive in two days, even though he paid for Prime.

1651
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:38,900
Okay.

1652
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:40,260
This way.

1653
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:41,980
He went back down?

1654
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,500
Why did he go back down?

1655
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:47,200
He got lost.

1656
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,640
It's GPS wasn't working.

1657
02:09:52,980 --> 02:09:54,900
He had no Wi-Fi there.

1658
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:07,680
Wait, oh, I was gonna say, where the fuck is he?

1659
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:08,640
He disappeared.

1660
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:13,820
Okay, down.

1661
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:18,680
Down here.

1662
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:21,760
Oh, my God.

1663
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:23,000
Where is he going?

1664
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:24,280
What?

1665
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:28,500

1667
02:10:57,790 --> 02:11:01,790
the bell-heart traders seem concerned for your safety and for the cargo you carry.

1668
02:11:02,610 --> 02:11:03,270
She said you?

1669
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:05,830
She needs to learn and learn a little patience.

1670
02:11:06,210 --> 02:11:08,030
I'm just barely been away.

1671
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:10,650
But still, as lucky as lucky for me you came.

1672
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:13,390
Bro, I saw your pathway.

1673
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:17,370
You went up, down, up down, left, right, then down again.

1674
02:11:17,530 --> 02:11:18,930
Like, where are you going?

1675
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:21,230
You went in a circle at one point.

1676
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:23,630
I do not think you know where you're going.

1677
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:31,930
Yeah, he was doing the fucking Konami code path thing.

1678
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:34,010
Well, I must be off now.

1679
02:11:34,270 --> 02:11:38,690
Now, grab you grabbing the bell and come after me yourself, and she's not getting her goods.

1680
02:11:39,110 --> 02:11:39,770
Alright, goodbye.

1681
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:44,050
And I didn't figure out how I can go back.

1682
02:11:47,050 --> 02:11:49,770
No, that motherfucker was not being chased.

1683
02:11:53,690 --> 02:11:56,010
Now I have to figure out how to get back, too.

1684
02:11:57,790 --> 02:11:58,670
Okay, it's up here.

1685
02:12:06,690 --> 02:12:07,430
There you go.

1686
02:12:09,030 --> 02:12:10,630
Yeah, I don't go back to Shellwood.

1687
02:12:10,890 --> 02:12:12,590
I don't want to go back this way to Shellwood.

1688
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:18,350
Alright, back to the Purple Hearts.

1689
02:12:18,530 --> 02:12:20,190
Oh my god, I'm so far from the Purple Hearts.

1690
02:12:20,410 --> 02:12:21,110
I was...

1691
02:12:21,110 --> 02:12:23,170
That was a long detour.

1692
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:28,830
I had a filler episode within a filler episode.

1693
02:12:28,910 --> 02:12:31,510
It started as a beach episode, and now we're on like...

1694
02:12:31,510 --> 02:12:32,590
We're now in the jungle.

1695
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:33,310
Okay.

1696
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:41,170
It was like here.

1697
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:51,870
It was like that Iran High School Host Club episode where they were on the beach and then suddenly they were in the jungle.

1698
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:53,570
It's literally that episode.

1699
02:12:58,860 --> 02:13:00,760
I think it was like here, right?

1700
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:03,300
Oh, it was here, okay.

1701
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,240
Oh, there's the stick bug.

1702
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:11,380
Oh, wait.

1703
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:14,620
There you go.

1704
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:16,780
Not cool.

1705
02:13:17,940 --> 02:13:20,080
I'm trying to destroy your home.

1706
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:21,040
That's not cool.

1707
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:23,100
Alright.

1708
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:25,860
Wait, that wasn't it.

1709
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:27,120
What?

1710
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:31,940
Oh, my God.

1711
02:13:33,080 --> 02:13:35,180
I thought...

1712
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:38,480
I thought he was a purple flower all along.

1713
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:40,120
Oh, my God.

1714
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:42,980
I just...

1715
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:48,960
I didn't realize not all purples equal flower.

1716
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:56,700
Oh my god, it's on the right side.

1717
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:03,420
Let's see, I remember I got a purple flower here.

1718
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:04,440
I'm pretty sure.

1719
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:11,500
Oh my god, there it is.

1720
02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:12,920
We didn't drop anything.

1721
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:13,980
Oh, there it is.

1722
02:14:15,820 --> 02:14:16,340
Okay.

1723
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:17,280
Nice.

1724
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:18,980
Okay, we got another one.

1725
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:22,400
No, we got it.

1726
02:14:23,380 --> 02:14:24,240
We have three now.

1727
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:27,020
Not all purple is a flower.

1728
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:28,720
Alright, where's the other room?

1729
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:30,600
Is it this one?

1730
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:32,980
This one or which one?

1731
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:40,300
This one?

1732
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:44,820
How do I get there?

1733
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:47,560
Oh, both?

1734
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:47,980
Okay.

1735
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:52,500
Because I don't know which one I already got a purple flower from, so we'll check both rooms.

1736
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:00,380
Oh.

1737
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:03,400
That's fine.

1738
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:07,620
Get him out of here.

1739
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:10,640
Oh my god, can I do that?

1740
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:13,620
I can.

1741
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:19,360
Uh, there you go.

1742
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,780
How do I get to this side of the bench?

1743
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:22,760
I assume it's...

1744
02:15:22,760 --> 02:15:23,120
What?

1745
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:25,540
Wait, how do I get to that bench?

1746
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:31,960
Oh, the elevator.

1747
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:32,500
Okay.

1748
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:34,240
There you go.

1749
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:39,240
There was a purple at...

1750
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:40,840
Where the fuck is green?

1751
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:42,340
What does that mean?

1752
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:42,960
It's all green.

1753
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,600
I don't know if you guys can see, but this is all green, I assume.

1754
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:47,180
Unless I'm colorblind.

1755
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:51,560
What do you mean?

1756
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,400
All of this is green.

1757
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:57,180
How can it be...

1758
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:59,720
How can it be any more green?

1759
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:05,760
Oops, I went the wrong way.

1760
02:16:11,570 --> 02:16:13,170
I'm gonna get there.

1761
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,170
Oh, it's here.

1762
02:16:16,510 --> 02:16:18,130
Try to find the other flower.

1763
02:16:18,710 --> 02:16:20,170
There should be another flower here.

1764
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:22,970
Oh, there it is.

1765
02:16:25,870 --> 02:16:26,390
Okay.

1766
02:16:29,390 --> 02:16:30,470
Oh, fuck this.

1767
02:16:31,670 --> 02:16:32,290
There you go.

1768
02:16:32,490 --> 02:16:33,570
Let's kill your home.

1769
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:36,030
All right, two more.

1770
02:16:36,930 --> 02:16:38,010
Oh, right side again?

1771
02:16:40,770 --> 02:16:41,250
Here?

1772
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:43,270
Oh yeah, there's an area here.

1773
02:16:43,530 --> 02:16:43,750
Okay.

1774
02:16:44,990 --> 02:16:46,010
I didn't see that area.

1775
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:53,140
Okay, that's not it.

1776
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:54,540
That's just their house.

1777
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:57,120
That's just where they live.

1778
02:16:57,620 --> 02:16:58,340
No, I've been here.

1779
02:16:58,420 --> 02:16:59,620
I mean, I've been here before?

1780
02:17:06,140 --> 02:17:07,980
Oh no, it's another secret.

1781
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:09,160
A long pin?

1782
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:10,580
What's that?

1783
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:13,260
Pierce through...

1784
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:13,380
Oh!

1785
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:16,020
There's another twirl.

1786
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:20,340
Yeah.

1787
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:22,940
Ah, shit.

1788
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:25,320
I gotta kill this orphan.

1789
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:28,220
Cannon, not revenge when you're dead.

1790
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:30,960
Okay, we gotta go.

1791
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:37,240
I'll go this way.

1792
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,380
Go to the room above.

1793
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:44,760
Alright, let's take the elevator.

1794
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:45,960
Actually, get the bench.

1795
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:46,320
first.

1796
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:47,200
I don't want to heal.

1797
02:17:48,660 --> 02:17:48,660
Alright.

1798
02:17:49,340 --> 02:17:50,080
Bench time.

1799
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,400
Oh.

1800
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:54,080
Okay.

1801
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:55,280
I should have just parkour.

1802
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:56,500
Never mind.

1803
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:58,460
Elevator time.

1804
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:02,440
It's actually parkour time.

1805
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:04,320
Yeah.

1806
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:10,580
Alright.

1807
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:11,600
Wrong floor.

1808
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:13,720
Oh.

1809
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:14,700
There's a flower.

1810
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:15,660
Here.

1811
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:17,000
Secret.

1812
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:18,400
Nice.

1813
02:18:18,700 --> 02:18:18,960
Alright.

1814
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:19,500
One more.

1815
02:18:19,600 --> 02:19:10,160

Okay, all right, all right, there you go.

1818
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:19,020
We did it, we figured it out.

1819
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:20,940
Wait, we did it, guys.

1820
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:28,060
Hey, freak, you guys, there's no, there's no, it's, the rule is there's, there's only one rule.

1821
02:19:28,700 --> 02:19:36,600
It's, oh my, there's only one rule and it's one, it's nearly one, two, or three.

1822
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:39,920
So I am not good with math.

1823
02:19:39,940 --> 02:19:41,440
I got confused.

1824
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:46,760
I feel like I got this one, right?

1825
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:47,720
No, I got this one.

1826
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:48,280
I remember.

1827
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:51,240
Yeah, we got this one.

1828
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:52,340
Okay, it's not one.

1829
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:53,500
All right.

1830
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:54,740
It's not this.

1831
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:56,080
All right.

1832
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:58,780
One, one, two.

1833
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:01,180
Dragon's cat, cow.

1834
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:05,220
All right.

1835
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:06,360
Two.

1836
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:06,980
Okay.

1837
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:09,920
Guys, there's no three.

1838
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:11,360
I count two!

1839
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:13,060
It's one or two!

1840
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:16,140
Where are you getting three from?

1841
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:19,460
Alright, two.

1842
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:20,540
Okay, is this one?

1843
02:20:25,870 --> 02:20:27,530
I get that one already, though?

1844
02:20:28,330 --> 02:20:28,910
I don't know.

1845
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:31,790
Oh, it's time to find out.

1846
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:38,410
Apparently they nerfed this boss.

1847
02:20:38,530 --> 02:20:39,810
She was so fucking easy.

1848
02:20:39,910 --> 02:20:40,810
I was so surprised.

1849
02:20:41,850 --> 02:20:43,650
I'm surprised this boss got nerfed.

1850
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:48,440
Okay.

1851
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:50,500
I think we got this one right now.

1852
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:51,840
Oh, no, we didn't, because there's money.

1853
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:54,320
There's money to collect.

1854
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:00,880
Yeah, we didn't get this one.

1855
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,020
Oh, my God.

1856
02:21:07,260 --> 02:21:08,420
God, I hate these stick bugs.

1857
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:09,960
I hate these flying stick bugs.

1858
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:15,360
I got flying.

1859
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:16,760
It's one of them.

1860
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:18,700
God damn it.

1861
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:20,200
All right.

1862
02:21:20,220 --> 02:21:21,260
I'll get our money back.

1863
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:25,660
Accidentally landed on a stick bug.

1864
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:30,500
I got stick bugged into a stick bug.

1865
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:35,360
Alright.

1866
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:37,460
It's this way.

1867
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:40,740
Oh, cruel irony.

1868
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:45,620
Get stick bugged.

1869
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:52,260
Alright.

1870
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:53,800
This should be the...

1871
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:55,240
This has to be the upgrade though.

1872
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:57,260
This guy got run for that.

1873
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:02,320
Alright, nice.

1874
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,140
I got hot potato.

1875
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:04,880
Yeah, I did.

1876
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:06,140
I did it.

1877
02:22:06,140 --> 02:22:07,060
It was down here, right?

1878
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:08,160
Yeah.

1879
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:13,020
Like, this guy's there just minding his own business and killed me.

1880
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:16,140
His mere existence fucked me up.

1881
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:21,160
No, I think I did this area before.

1882
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:22,880
I'm pretty sure.

1883
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:25,000
Because, like...

1884
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,060
No, I definitely did this area.

1885
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:31,360
before I just forgot to

1886
02:22:40,320 --> 02:23:06,280

1888
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:08,560
Here.

1889
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:09,920
Okay.

1890
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:12,540
I assume that's the ability pillar.

1891
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:14,500
Yeah.

1892
02:23:18,140 --> 02:23:19,640
Wait, yep or no?

1893
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,300
Someone said no.

1894
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:24,120
Room before.

1895
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:25,000
Here.

1896
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:28,500
Okay, in this room.

1897
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,320
Okay, it's in this room.

1898
02:23:34,990 --> 02:23:36,230
Okay, is it this?

1899
02:23:39,130 --> 02:23:39,570
No.

1900
02:23:44,030 --> 02:23:45,170
What could it be?

1901
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:49,190
Oh, there it is.

1902
02:23:49,910 --> 02:23:50,610
I found it.

1903
02:23:50,810 --> 02:23:51,250
There you go.

1904
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,170
I found the flowers.

1905
02:23:53,470 --> 02:23:54,910
Alright, who made this wish?

1906
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:57,150
I don't even remember.

1907
02:23:57,450 --> 02:23:58,570
Who made this wish?

1908
02:24:00,350 --> 02:24:01,370
Okay, it's just...

1909
02:24:01,370 --> 02:24:01,790
Oh, shit.

1910
02:24:01,910 --> 02:24:02,570
That's not what I want to do.

1911
02:24:03,130 --> 02:24:04,470

1912
02:24:05,210 --> 02:24:06,430
Okay, I just have to go down.

1913
02:24:07,350 --> 02:24:08,130
He did it.

1914
02:24:11,170 --> 02:24:14,810
I don't even know who made it.

1915
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:16,870
Who wished for this?

1916
02:24:19,410 --> 02:24:21,110
A hut in Shellwood?

1917
02:24:22,750 --> 02:24:23,870

1918
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:24,850

02:24:28,650 --> 02:24:29,490
There's so many huts.

1923
02:24:29,710 --> 02:24:29,890
Okay.

1924
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:33,470
Does she live in one or two?

1925
02:24:34,870 --> 02:24:35,950
The squiggly...

1926
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:37,630

Right of the polyp.

1966
02:27:03,470 --> 02:27:05,050
The first right can begin.

1967
02:27:05,710 --> 02:27:06,210
Alright, cool.

1968
02:27:07,430 --> 02:27:09,070

1976
02:27:26,010 --> 02:27:33,210

1977
02:27:36,490 --> 02:27:37,430

02:27:41,350 --> 02:27:43,350
Bug, cloaked by red.

1981
02:27:43,630 --> 02:27:45,490
The time a rebirth approaches.

1982
02:27:46,110 --> 02:27:47,250
First right is completed.

1983
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:49,590

1984
02:27:50,210 --> 02:27:52,190

1996
02:28:18,530 --> 02:28:19,490
Oh, shit.

02:28:21,570 --> 02:28:22,010
Nice.

1999
02:28:22,210 --> 02:28:22,970
That's good.

2000
02:28:23,630 --> 02:28:24,530
That's a good filler.

2001
02:28:26,970 --> 02:28:26,970
Alright.

2002
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:28,290
Flint beetles.

2003
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:33,640
Alright.

2004
02:28:34,220 --> 02:28:34,220

02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:41,460
It's Loki at Broken.

2008
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,600
Flint beetles and silver.

2009
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:44,220
Oh, silver beetles next to me.

2010
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:45,500
Yeah.

2011
02:28:45,580 --> 02:28:46,840
I might as well just do the silver beetles.

2012
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:47,960
It's very next to me.

2013
02:28:48,900 --> 02:28:49,660
Where am I?

2014
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:50,720
First off.

2015
02:28:50,860 --> 02:28:51,720
Where am I?

2016
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:53,200
Before we do anything.

2017
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:57,040
Alright.

2018
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:57,520
And

2019
02:29:00,900 --> 02:29:03,720
look, they're just hiding.

2020
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:05,560
They're just like, she's coming.

2021
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:11,040
They're like, shh, she's coming.

2022
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:13,120
Hide under the bench with me, Jerry.

2023
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:15,660
Oh, is there a new wish?

2024
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:21,140
Bro, I don't even have money to buy food.

2025
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:22,680
You think I'm going to donate it to you?

2026
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:24,980
Wait, how much money do I even have?

2027
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:30,420
I can't even, I can't barely afford to sit down.

2028
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:33,360
And you want me to donate to your fucking charity?

2029
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,000
Okay, uh...

2030
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:43,960
Porgia was so shaking by his misadventures, I was gonna have the heart to dock his earnings.

2031
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,340
I'll as well know.

2032
02:29:47,460 --> 02:29:50,360
Take a look at the lovely new goods I have available.

2033
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:52,900
Wow, I love window shopping.

2034
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:53,720

2035
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:56,080
Uh...

2036
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:59,620
To heal it, can't say I felt it affects myself, but then I can...

2037
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:02,220
and 80 rosaries?

2038
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:06,620
Is this good?

2039
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:10,160

2040
02:30:14,890 --> 02:30:16,470

2085
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:25,590
Okay, is it here?

2086
02:32:30,070 --> 02:32:31,310
Is it these guys?

2087
02:32:34,190 --> 02:32:35,270
Do they give me...

2088
02:32:35,290 --> 02:32:36,510
The silver bells?

2089
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:38,830
Hello.

2090
02:32:39,550 --> 02:32:40,290
Oh, oops.

2091
02:32:43,430 --> 02:32:45,290
How do I...

2092
02:32:46,010 --> 02:32:48,970
No demand for bells in this economy.

2093
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:50,670
Then what's the point?

2094
02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:56,310
Oh, they just randomly spawned.

2095
02:32:58,030 --> 02:32:59,170
Oh, there it is.

2096
02:32:59,490 --> 02:33:00,610
There's one of the bells.

2097
02:33:01,630 --> 02:33:03,490
Look, just lead the pilgrims.

2098
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:04,190
Oh, shit.

2099
02:33:11,350 --> 02:33:15,610
Just lead the pilgrims into this bellhole.

2100
02:33:18,730 --> 02:33:20,850
And then have them seriously died.

2101
02:33:21,070 --> 02:33:22,250
No one's going to find their body.

2102
02:33:22,350 --> 02:33:24,270
They'll just assume they'll die from the pilgrimage.

2103
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:31,520
Alright.

2104
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:38,560
They'll just assume they die from the pilgrimage because only 10% of them even make it.

2105
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:42,860
Let's push the pilgrims.

2106
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:45,720
Let's just lead them into this area.

2107
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:51,320
We'll just be like it was an accident, you know?

2108
02:33:52,220 --> 02:33:55,560
They just somehow wandered into the bell caverns.

2109
02:33:56,300 --> 02:33:58,180
Oh no, it's so unfortunate.

2110
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:06,640
Goodbye.

2111
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:12,480
If I, if I, like, come back, do they, like, respawn?

2112
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:13,120
else.

2113
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:22,260
Oh, okay.

2114
02:34:23,380 --> 02:34:24,380
They respawn again.

2115
02:34:24,580 --> 02:34:25,060
Okay, nice.

2116
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:27,280
That's good to know.

2117
02:34:30,340 --> 02:34:31,860
Alright, get these guys out of here.

2118
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,560
Let me see if they spawn in here.

2119
02:34:42,930 --> 02:34:43,770
Ooh, that was close.

2120
02:34:46,810 --> 02:34:47,630
Oh, nice.

2121
02:34:47,830 --> 02:35:00,430

02:35:15,740 --> 02:35:17,720

02:35:20,690 --> 02:35:22,230
Oh, he doesn't this fucker

2125
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:31,740

02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:32,340
That's fine.

02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:33,740
I need to go down anyway.

2128
02:35:34,400 --> 02:35:37,700
I Need to go down anyway.

2129
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:39,180
It's fine.

2130
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:40,500
I needed to go down.

2131
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:46,340
It's a speed run tactic It was a speed run.

2132
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:47,040
Look at that!

2133
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:49,120
I got my stuff back!

2134
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:50,140
Plan!

2135
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:56,360
Oh, I thought I would fall here.

2136
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:03,240
Okay, fuck this guy, though.

2137
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:07,700
Wait, how many do I need to get?

2138
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:09,960
Three more.

2139
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:10,560
Okay.

2140
02:36:18,570 --> 02:36:20,570
It might be one.

2141
02:36:20,990 --> 02:36:21,650
Yeah, nice.

2142
02:36:22,050 --> 02:36:22,970
Okay, two more.

2143
02:36:27,740 --> 02:36:28,720
Are you serious?

2144
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:29,620
Okay, that's fine.

2145
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:32,960
Quen!

2146
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:35,460
Alright, one more.

2147
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:38,120
I'll just reset this.

2148
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:43,140
I guess I'll go downstairs?

2149
02:36:48,530 --> 02:36:49,110
There might be one.

2150
02:36:49,230 --> 02:36:50,930
Oh my god, there's none here.

2151
02:36:54,250 --> 02:36:54,950

Just one.

2157
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:10,700
Oh, nice.

2158
02:37:12,220 --> 02:37:12,820
There you go.

2159
02:37:13,300 --> 02:37:13,640
Completed.

2160
02:37:16,140 --> 02:37:17,620
Got these guys out of here.

2161
02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:21,640
Alright, nice.

2162
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:25,320
And then...

2163
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:27,460
Okay, we're gonna take it to the...

2164
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:28,900
The bell area.

2165
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:30,420
Yeah.

2166
02:37:31,660 --> 02:37:32,040
Yeah.

2167
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:38,460
I'll go.

2168
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:47,250
All right.

2169
02:37:47,750 --> 02:37:49,750
Take my wish, child.

2170
02:37:50,370 --> 02:37:51,310
You sick child.

2171
02:37:54,230 --> 02:37:55,230
I hope you get cured.

2172
02:37:57,230 --> 02:37:57,730
All right.

2173
02:37:57,810 --> 02:37:58,570
I got money.

2174
02:37:59,070 --> 02:38:00,130
Okay, now I got money.

2175
02:38:00,950 --> 02:38:02,870
I almost have 800.

2176
02:38:07,540 --> 02:38:09,120
Do I need to give some money?

2177
02:38:09,460 --> 02:38:11,020
I could just buy this, though.

2178
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:15,960
Alright, uh...

2179
02:38:15,960 --> 02:38:17,320
What other wish do I have to make?

2180
02:38:19,060 --> 02:38:20,460
Alright, what's next?

2181
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:21,700
This guy?

2182
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:23,380
The Flint Beetle?

2183
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:35,840
Oh, whoops, my hands look.

2184
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:37,780
Yeah?

2185
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:38,340
Okay.

2186
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:40,780
We'll tell Flint Beetles.

2187
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,300
They have in the marrow.

2188
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:45,560
Alright, we gotta figure out where it is.

2189
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:51,700
Oh, this way.

2190
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,320
Okay, uh...

2191
02:38:58,320 --> 02:39:01,140
One of them is near the place where I play the carnival games.

2192
02:39:01,620 --> 02:39:02,520
That's great.

2193
02:39:04,420 --> 02:39:04,860
No.

2194
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:08,240
I go back to my addiction.

2195
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:12,420
It's okay.

2196
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:13,500
I won't relapse.

2197
02:39:13,700 --> 02:39:14,380
I swear to God.

2198
02:39:15,640 --> 02:39:19,920
It might call me like a green goblin mask, but I won't relapse, guys.

2199
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:20,620
Trust me.

2200
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:22,080
All right, where is it?

2201
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:24,420
Where are...

2202
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:26,120
Uh...

2203
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:27,060
Where are they?

2204
02:39:28,140 --> 02:39:29,520
I haven't not gotten up here.

2205
02:39:29,620 --> 02:39:30,420
Wait, I should go up here.

2206
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:31,460
What is up here?

2207
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:37,440
Whoops.

2208
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:43,600
What is up here?

2209
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:44,660
I didn't go up there yet.

2210
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:51,820
Uh... Right over here.

2211
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:54,740
What the fuck is up here?

2212
02:39:56,940 --> 02:39:57,400
Hello?

2213
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:58,980
Hello?

2214
02:39:59,220 --> 02:39:59,680
Oh!

2215
02:39:59,940 --> 02:40:00,720
Oh my god!

2216
02:40:01,780 --> 02:40:03,500
Wait, but I killed the widow!

2217
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:07,120
How is he still?

2218
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:18,580
This- oh, never- I thought- I thought I was like- Look, I thought- I didn't realize he was- she was not alive yet!

2219
02:40:20,320 --> 02:40:20,620
You know what?

2220
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:21,680
Fuck this, I'm healing.

2221
02:40:22,360 --> 02:40:22,740
When?

2222
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:30,200
I got beat, it's so hard.

2223
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:32,280
Oh, nice.

2224
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:35,900
That's, we actually needed that.

2225
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:36,660
Wee.

2226
02:40:41,890 --> 02:40:43,490
I thought it was the widow.

2227
02:40:44,070 --> 02:40:45,970
I guess the widow didn't do that then.

2228
02:40:46,830 --> 02:40:46,970
Okay.

2229
02:40:47,390 --> 02:40:48,210
Oh, maybe here?

2230
02:40:48,470 --> 02:40:49,650
I haven't locked that area.

2231
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:57,000
Oh, she was only haunting Bellheart.

2232
02:40:57,200 --> 02:40:57,620
Oh.

2233
02:40:59,180 --> 02:41:02,780
So I thought that was her doing the, all the hauntings.

2234
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:07,660
Oh my god, are you serious?

2235
02:41:07,720 --> 02:41:08,740
I was there at the edge.

2236
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:09,240
Oh.

2237
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:10,800
When?

2238
02:41:15,980 --> 02:41:16,980
Okay, I need two.

2239
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:17,880
I need your money.

2240
02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:20,400
You're not milk making to the citadel.

2241
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:24,360
Don't worry, I'll take you to your god faster.

2242
02:41:27,360 --> 02:41:28,600
Technically, I'm doing them all a favor.

2243
02:41:28,760 --> 02:41:30,240
They don't have to do the pilgrimage.

2244
02:41:31,360 --> 02:41:32,460
In the end.

2245
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:36,260
I'm taking them to their heaven faster.

2246
02:41:40,410 --> 02:41:43,030
I'm doing them all a big favor right now.

2247
02:41:45,950 --> 02:41:48,690
This room is, like, here.

2248
02:41:53,110 --> 02:41:57,190
Get rid of these before I have to do this stupid parkour area.

2249
02:41:58,950 --> 02:41:59,270
Here?

2250
02:42:00,170 --> 02:42:00,670
No.

02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:05,960
Like.

02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:09,940

I knew where it is.

2266
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:47,380
Okay, this guy's fucking crazy.

2267
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:49,760
There you go.

2268
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:51,040
Oh, shit.

2269
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:51,860
Okay, that was an accident.

2270
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:56,140
Oh, nice.

2271
02:43:56,340 --> 02:43:56,660
Easy.

2272
02:43:57,740 --> 02:43:59,420
Okay, I'm pretty OP right now.

2273
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:00,940
All right.

2274
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:02,500

2277
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:39,600
Okay.

2278
02:44:41,060 --> 02:44:41,860
That's good.

2279
02:44:42,980 --> 02:44:43,380
Okay.

2280
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:43,760
Ow.

2281
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:46,980
Shit.

2282
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:48,040
We'll use that area.

2283
02:44:48,980 --> 02:44:50,480
I like my little Navi.

2284
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:51,820
Hey, listen.

2285
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:54,140
But there's like 20 of you guys.

2286
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:59,920
But it's a little worse because there's 20 of you guys.

2287
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:02,380
I gotta figure out which one is the right Navi.

2288
02:45:02,580 --> 02:45:06,600
Which one is the Navi that tells the lie and which one's the one that tells the truth.

2289
02:45:14,100 --> 02:45:15,300
Only 20?

2290
02:45:26,660 --> 02:45:28,100
Yeah, only 20.

2291
02:45:28,220 --> 02:45:29,320
And the rest are my bots.

2292
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:33,060
For legal reason, YouTube, that's a joke.

2293
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:34,180
I'm not botting.

2294
02:45:37,980 --> 02:45:42,280
You've already changed the algorithm enough.

2295
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:49,580
You already changed the viewer system enough, YouTube.

2296
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:52,800
I think that's proof enough that I'm not botting.

2297
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:59,340
Okay, this way.

2298
02:45:59,580 --> 02:45:59,920
All right.

2299
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:02,180
It should be around here.

2300
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:04,100
Oh, there he is.

2301
02:46:07,280 --> 02:46:07,620
Whoa.

2302
02:46:12,070 --> 02:46:12,830
Are you serious?

2303
02:46:16,510 --> 02:46:17,610
Oh, my, that's fine.

2304
02:46:19,210 --> 02:46:20,490
I just never stop.

2305
02:46:21,250 --> 02:46:21,750
All right, nice.

2306
02:46:21,830 --> 02:46:22,310
I got it.

2307
02:46:22,410 --> 02:46:23,170
Wish updated.

2308
02:46:26,550 --> 02:46:27,030
Um...

2309
02:46:28,850 --> 02:46:30,070
All right, nice.

2310
02:46:30,630 --> 02:46:31,750
We got that wish.

2311
02:46:32,410 --> 02:46:39,110
I still not use my tools, even though I have a an OP OP build for it.

2312
02:46:41,530 --> 02:46:42,910
Solid Snake, they give us a super chat.

2313
02:46:43,130 --> 02:46:43,830
Thank you, thank you.

2314
02:46:44,190 --> 02:46:44,730
Hey, listen.

2315
02:46:44,850 --> 02:46:45,890
No, don't listen to them.

2316
02:46:46,310 --> 02:46:47,190
Listen, you're getting one guy.

2317
02:46:47,310 --> 02:46:47,530
Listen.

2318
02:46:47,690 --> 02:46:48,470
What that guy's?

2319
02:46:48,650 --> 02:46:48,650
Listen.

2320
02:46:49,430 --> 02:46:49,430
Listen.

2321
02:46:49,530 --> 02:46:50,010
Don't keep.

2322
02:46:51,990 --> 02:46:53,750
I'm like, I'm listening.

2323
02:46:54,930 --> 02:46:55,410
I'm listening.

2324
02:47:03,690 --> 02:47:04,690
Okay, um...

2325
02:47:06,090 --> 02:47:06,590
Um...

2326
02:47:06,590 --> 02:47:07,070
Alright.

2327
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:09,350
Speak.

2328
02:47:09,510 --> 02:47:11,490
Do we need to do this crawl bug clearing?

2329
02:47:18,730 --> 02:47:20,610
Wait, is that important or nah?

2330
02:47:27,060 --> 02:47:28,260
It's pretty quick.

2331
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:29,080
I don't even know what it is.

2332
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:31,480
Speak to the creek of halfway home.

2333
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:33,540
Where the fuck is that?

2334
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:34,800
Like, where?

2335
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:38,260
Rescue, thank you for the super chat thingy.

2336
02:47:38,640 --> 02:47:38,960
Thank you.

2337
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:41,720
What is that?

2338
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:42,580
Ada!

2339
02:47:46,190 --> 02:47:47,770
Oh, the hotel guy?

2340
02:47:49,970 --> 02:47:52,150
I'm just like, where the fuck is that?

2341
02:47:53,250 --> 02:47:54,030
Oh, it's in...

2342
02:47:54,030 --> 02:47:54,710
It's the end.

2343
02:47:54,890 --> 02:47:55,430
Oh!

2344
02:48:03,900 --> 02:48:04,900
Get this way.

2345
02:48:09,590 --> 02:48:10,730
That's the bar.

2346
02:48:11,130 --> 02:48:11,430
Alright.

2347
02:48:12,150 --> 02:48:12,970
Time to go.

2348
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:14,870
Let's be o'clock time.

2349
02:48:15,170 --> 02:48:15,330
Ow.

2350
02:48:15,790 --> 02:48:17,230
God damn stupid flying rats.

2351
02:48:18,910 --> 02:48:19,570
I hope the rat...

2352
02:48:19,570 --> 02:48:21,470
I hope rats never evolved to have wings.

2353
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:28,860
I mean, that'll be so fucked up.

2354
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:29,980
Oh, hey, is it him?

2355
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:30,900
Yes, go get it.

2356
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:33,280
Oh, sister, I'm still here.

2357
02:48:34,120 --> 02:48:34,860
I'm sat...

2358
02:48:34,860 --> 02:48:40,120
I'm sat here all bend and bender-aggled, but you look fresh as the day you was hatched.

2359
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:44,160
How you fare so well in these drenched and dangerous lands.

2360
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:46,340
Maybe you got a secret you could share.

2361
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:49,380
None that would offer easy aid, good bug.

2362
02:48:49,640 --> 02:48:53,060
Whatever luck or savvy brought you this far, may continue on your journey.

2363
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:53,940
All right.

2364
02:48:53,980 --> 02:48:54,400
Winita.

2365
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,640
Barkeep, I've seen your quest on the bell times wish wall.

2366
02:48:58,100 --> 02:48:59,400
What assistance are you seeking?

2367
02:48:59,720 --> 02:49:01,060
Ha, perfect.

2368
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:02,540
You're the able sort.

2369
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:04,160
Now make short work of the task.

2370
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:06,960
The problem is those blasted craws atop here.

2371
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:10,560
My roof is fast, becoming their cozy nest.

2372
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:14,560
Now they groomed so bald, they're starting to attack pilgrims as they pass.

2375
02:50:43,130 --> 02:50:45,190
God, these guys are so annoying, though.

2376
02:50:47,890 --> 02:50:48,330
Okay.

2377
02:50:49,330 --> 02:50:53,650
Oh my god, I forgot that they stay in the sky for a while.

2378
02:50:54,030 --> 02:50:56,370
All right, I know there's some above me.

2379
02:50:59,170 --> 02:51:00,670
I'll go to the source.

2380
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:07,480
All right, there should be more.

2381
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:08,700
No, that's just pilgrim.

2382
02:51:08,700 --> 02:51:09,500
Oh, that's fine.

2383
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:11,480
I needed to kill the pilgrims anyway.

2384
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:16,840
I think there's more living.

2385
02:51:20,060 --> 02:51:21,440
Where do they live?

2386
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:22,660
They live right here.

2387
02:51:31,640 --> 02:51:33,160
This way, there you are.

2388
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:38,820
Oh my god.

2389
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:40,780
I forgot that they do the sleeping thing.

2390
02:51:41,580 --> 02:51:43,340
Alright, now they slowly fall.

2391
02:51:44,200 --> 02:51:45,280
Very slowly.

2392
02:51:47,300 --> 02:51:47,560
Woo!

2393
02:51:47,580 --> 02:51:48,760
Oh

2394
02:51:52,390 --> 02:51:53,310

2395
02:51:55,230 --> 02:51:56,950
Oh my gosh, they fell down

2396
02:52:00,290 --> 02:52:02,210
Oh, but wait actually

2398
02:52:10,850 --> 02:52:12,030
What did I do?

2399
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:15,810
Oh, I wasn't supposed to do that.

2400
02:52:15,930 --> 02:52:18,330
Okay Where do they live?

2401
02:52:18,890 --> 02:52:23,490

I didn't think...

2418
02:54:12,460 --> 02:54:13,960
I didn't think he was real.

2419
02:54:14,080 --> 02:54:15,360
I thought he was a background.

2420
02:54:21,100 --> 02:54:23,400
I thought he was part of the background.

2421
02:54:27,990 --> 02:54:28,890
Okay, we need more.

2422
02:54:29,090 --> 02:54:30,070
We need more birds.

2423
02:54:32,770 --> 02:54:33,730
Is there any more birds?

2424
02:54:38,350 --> 02:54:40,050
Okay, there's one here.

02:54:55,910 --> 02:54:57,350
of your body parts.

2430
02:55:00,250 --> 02:55:02,190
Well, I think there's one here, right?

02:55:31,290 --> 02:55:32,210
Are they inside?

2441
02:55:33,130 --> 02:55:33,770
Hello?

2442
02:55:37,670 --> 02:55:39,530
Where are the other birds?

2443
02:55:43,870 --> 02:55:45,550
Oh my god, does it lock again?

2444
02:55:46,110 --> 02:55:46,710
Okay, it doesn't.

2445
02:55:46,830 --> 02:55:47,430
Okay, thank god.

2446
02:55:47,590 --> 02:55:51,510
I was gonna say, if this locks again, I'd be so sad.

2447
02:55:55,230 --> 02:55:56,830
Okay, you can't fly that far.

2448
02:55:59,790 --> 02:56:00,470
There you go.

2449
02:56:01,030 --> 02:56:01,430
Fuen!

2450
02:56:02,530 --> 02:56:02,970
Completed.

2451
02:56:04,250 --> 02:56:05,930
Omar, this one gave me five.

2452
02:56:10,930 --> 02:56:13,090
Where were you when I was farming earlier?

2453
02:56:16,090 --> 02:56:17,150
Okay, nice.

2454
02:56:18,370 --> 02:56:18,910
When?

2455
02:56:23,020 --> 02:56:25,280
We just gotta go back to the bar.

2456
02:56:31,460 --> 02:56:33,120
Time to cash in on the money.

2457
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:43,960
Alright, barkeep.

2458
02:56:44,200 --> 02:56:45,520

02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:39,490
Aye, this should be enough.

2470
02:57:40,410 --> 02:57:45,110
Once I find a quiet moment, I'll get straight to building that mighty scarecrow.

2471
02:57:45,870 --> 02:57:46,850
Wish me a little luck.

2472
02:57:47,090 --> 02:57:50,110
My route should be clear of those pests that were next to you pass by.

2473

02:58:02,650 --> 02:58:07,410
I've been holding on to it for someone else, but they've been gone long enough that I know they won't be returning.

2479
02:58:08,030 --> 02:58:08,670
Thank you, sir.

2480
02:58:08,990 --> 02:58:10,470
This is worthy trade for my work.

2481
02:58:10,970 --> 02:58:13,270
My tools shall attain an even sharper edge.

2482
02:58:13,910 --> 02:58:15,230
Alright, we got the upgrade.

2483
02:58:16,150 --> 02:58:17,430
Alright, we did all the wishes!

2484
02:58:18,950 --> 02:58:19,790
Is that...

2485
02:58:19,790 --> 02:58:20,490
Is that enough?

2486
02:58:21,350 --> 02:58:24,010
We finally go do act two now?

2487
02:58:24,830 --> 02:58:26,050
Are we strong enough?

2488
02:58:32,730 --> 02:58:34,210
Man, pretty sweet.

2489
02:58:34,330 --> 02:58:37,350

2490
02:58:38,150 --> 02:58:39,710
Never strong enough.

2491
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:45,120

2492
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:45,600
Alright.

2493
02:58:45,980 --> 02:58:48,700
Then we should be able to... No.

2494
02:58:49,460 --> 02:58:51,120
But you can try.

2495
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:55,700

2496
02:58:57,080 --> 02:58:57,840

02:59:00,260 --> 02:59:01,560

This place.

2551
03:03:26,030 --> 03:03:28,210
This place is a new hell.

This is all hell.

2560
03:03:51,130 --> 03:03:54,490
I'm just- what if- what if I just- I've already died and this is my hell?

I'm like in the circle of hell right now.

2562
03:03:59,750 --> 03:04:02,190
Horde was actually already dead.

2563
03:04:05,030 --> 03:04:06,790
Go all the way right.

2564
03:04:07,730 --> 03:04:08,630
Keep going, right?

2565
03:04:09,330 --> 03:04:09,690

03:04:12,530 --> 03:04:13,390
What do you mean?

2567
03:04:19,590 --> 03:04:22,330
Yeah, Hornet died in hollowness.

Yeah, Hornet is actually in a coma.

2571
03:04:33,220 --> 03:04:34,000
We're all in a...

2572
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,380
She's actually in a coma right now.

2573
03:04:40,170 --> 03:04:40,910
Oh!

2574
03:04:42,270 --> 03:04:43,010

2575
03:04:43,590 --> 03:04:44,210
Okay, I see.

2576
03:04:45,310 --> 03:04:46,750
This is...

2577
03:04:48,650 --> 03:04:50,990
This is my Hornet in a coma theory.

2578
03:04:53,710 --> 03:04:57,470
It's all happening in her fucking dream right now.

2579
03:05:05,150 --> 03:05:05,870

Wee.

2583
03:05:17,650 --> 03:05:18,070
Oh shit.

2584
03:05:19,250 --> 03:05:19,610
Nice.

2585
03:05:20,970 --> 03:05:21,690
Recovered.

2586
03:05:24,010 --> 03:05:27,410
Okay, this is where I bought, got the rope shit.

Wee.

2591
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:46,870
Where is it?

2592
03:05:46,930 --> 03:05:48,450
Okay, it's all the way to the right.

2593
03:05:53,030 --> 03:05:53,430
Ow.

2594
03:05:58,720 --> 03:05:59,160
Oh, wait.

2595
03:05:59,380 --> 03:05:59,780
Pilgrims.

2596
03:05:59,980 --> 03:06:00,140
Oh, wait.

2597
03:06:00,220 --> 03:06:00,640

2598
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:01,740
Oh, shit!

2599
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:02,140
I forgot!

2600
03:06:03,740 --> 03:06:04,600
Oh, my God.

2601
03:06:05,580 --> 03:06:06,460
Okay, this is bad.

2602
03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:07,320
This is very bad.

2603
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:08,820
This is very bad.

2604
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:11,980
Oh, my God.

2605
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:13,540
But I swear, I cannot die to this guy.

2606
03:06:14,160 --> 03:06:15,720
I swear to God.

2607
03:06:16,320 --> 03:06:17,800
Don't let me die to him.

2608
03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:21,140
Oh my God.

2609
03:06:21,280 --> 03:06:22,880
Please, there has to be something I can poke.

2610
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:26,000
Oh, I forgot how to...

2611
03:06:28,420 --> 03:06:29,560
I'm so scared.

2612
03:06:29,820 --> 03:06:31,080
I'm actually...

2613
03:06:31,080 --> 03:06:32,100
I'm so scared.

2614
03:06:32,380 --> 03:06:32,660
Okay.

2615
03:06:33,060 --> 03:06:34,640
Oh my God, I'm so scared.

2616
03:06:34,860 --> 03:06:36,640
I thought I died there.

2617
03:06:36,880 --> 03:06:37,880
I thought I was gonna die.

2618
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:38,500
All right.

2619
03:06:41,300 --> 03:06:41,740
What?

2620
03:06:46,800 --> 03:06:48,840
All right, what's this?

2621
03:06:49,720 --> 03:06:51,200
Oh, it's another security.

2622
03:06:51,380 --> 03:06:52,740
Timu security system.

2623
03:06:55,220 --> 03:06:55,500
Hello.

2624
03:06:57,780 --> 03:06:58,400
Ow.

2625
03:07:07,260 --> 03:07:10,440
Oh, I have to make sure I ran all the way, right?

2626
03:07:10,860 --> 03:07:12,100
There we go.

2627
03:07:12,860 --> 03:07:13,480
I did it.

2628
03:07:13,500 --> 03:07:15,540
I figured out this very hard puzzle.

2629
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:18,800
speed anklet.

2630
03:07:21,580 --> 03:07:25,140
Anklet of a lever draws upon to increase sprinter speed.

2631
03:07:25,440 --> 03:07:27,120
Oh, so I'm just a little faster.

2632
03:07:27,700 --> 03:07:29,060
Do I need that, though?

2633
03:07:33,060 --> 03:07:33,580
Really?

2634
03:07:34,340 --> 03:07:36,140
I don't run a lot, though.

2635
03:07:44,170 --> 03:07:44,690
Yeah.

2636
03:07:46,810 --> 03:07:48,330
But I don't run a lot.

2637
03:07:53,250 --> 03:07:54,010
Oh my god.

2638
03:07:54,050 --> 03:07:55,670
Wait, I actually Oh, shit.

2639
03:07:55,790 --> 03:07:57,350
I was trying to use my ability.

2640
03:07:58,310 --> 03:07:59,490
Oh my god, please.

2641
03:08:02,630 --> 03:08:03,390
That's good.

2642
03:08:05,150 --> 03:08:06,930
Oh, it depends if I like speed.

2643
03:08:09,270 --> 03:08:11,450
Just want to make sure I grab some stuff here.

2644
03:08:12,270 --> 03:08:14,690
Because I'm thinking, like, do I actually need that?

2645
03:08:19,970 --> 03:08:21,510
Oh, I can't even do this.

2646
03:08:26,350 --> 03:08:27,450
I need your money.

2647
03:08:27,590 --> 03:08:28,370
I need cash money.

2648
03:08:28,630 --> 03:08:29,450

Thank you.

2656
03:09:18,470 --> 03:09:19,470
I can't help it.

2657
03:09:19,650 --> 03:09:21,270
There's carnival games.

2658
03:09:24,130 --> 03:09:27,050
They got me with the carnival games.

2659
03:09:27,350 --> 03:09:28,490
I can't help it.

2660
03:09:32,170 --> 03:09:33,670
I have to take a loan.

2661
03:09:36,990 --> 03:09:38,030
He's the same.

2662
03:09:43,020 --> 03:09:45,460
I have so many IOUs.

2663
03:09:46,200 --> 03:09:47,800
from the carnival.

2664
03:09:49,620 --> 03:09:51,720
Go right inside Bell Beast area.

2665
03:09:51,820 --> 03:09:53,320
Why do I have to go to the Bell Beast area?

2666
03:09:54,840 --> 03:09:56,540
Isn't that important, though?

2667
03:09:56,900 --> 03:09:57,740
I'm just thinking.

2668
03:10:01,810 --> 03:10:03,290
I could go to the Citadel now?

2669
03:10:03,530 --> 03:10:05,010
Alright, Citadel time.

2670
03:10:05,970 --> 03:10:08,490
Um, I should buy some stuff, though.

Wait, actually, I have a memory locket.

Not for them, but for me.

2705
03:15:49,290 --> 03:15:50,390
Because I'm the main character.

2706
03:15:53,010 --> 03:15:54,050
There's an ant merchant?

2707
03:15:54,210 --> 03:15:54,810
Wait, where is he?

2708
03:15:55,090 --> 03:15:55,750
Where is that?

2709
03:15:58,210 --> 03:15:59,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2710
03:16:00,450 --> 03:16:02,450
There's like so many things I haven't spent money on.

2711
03:16:02,670 --> 03:16:03,710
They have just too much.

2712
03:16:04,230 --> 03:16:06,090
Too many things to spend money on.

2713
03:16:09,410 --> 03:16:10,210
Isn't Hunter's March?

2714
03:16:11,570 --> 03:16:14,210
Wait, do we have a trolley for Hunter's March?

2715
03:16:18,450 --> 03:16:20,910
Oh, it's this area.

2716
03:16:22,770 --> 03:16:24,770
Oh, but we never had to go back to the center.

2717
03:16:26,870 --> 03:16:28,470
Oh, my God.

2718
03:16:30,110 --> 03:16:31,530
We had to go to deep docks.

2719
03:16:32,190 --> 03:16:33,410
Oh, from far fields.

2720
03:16:33,930 --> 03:16:35,010
As far as feels closer.

2721
03:16:37,570 --> 03:16:38,810
Is it closer?

2722
03:16:47,650 --> 03:16:49,190
Is deep docks closer?

2723
03:16:49,970 --> 03:16:51,210
I'll do deep docks.

2724
03:16:51,770 --> 03:16:51,970
Yeah.

2725
03:16:53,230 --> 03:16:54,410
Can't believe the ants.

2726
03:16:54,530 --> 03:16:54,670
They live.

2727
03:16:54,690 --> 03:16:55,630
They live in isolation.

2728
03:16:56,190 --> 03:16:58,090
They close the doors for the trolley.

2729
03:17:00,910 --> 03:17:02,750
They're an isolationist nation.

2730
03:17:04,090 --> 03:17:05,590
They're like, no trolley here.

2731
03:17:05,950 --> 03:17:09,330
No outside transportation in my nation.

2732
03:17:14,250 --> 03:17:17,590
They refuse to let the outsiders in.

2733
03:17:30,080 --> 03:17:30,920
Okay, this way.

2734
03:17:31,760 --> 03:17:33,880
Oh shit, I was trying to look at my map.

2735
03:17:35,080 --> 03:17:35,540
Are you serious?

2736
03:17:35,700 --> 03:17:37,680
I was just looking... Are you... Oh my god!

2737
03:17:37,900 --> 03:17:39,180
Just hit everything on me!

2738
03:17:40,080 --> 03:17:41,460
You're like the homage!

2739
03:17:42,720 --> 03:17:45,460
No technology allowed, an ant nation.

2740
03:17:55,970 --> 03:17:56,350
Yeah.

2741
03:17:57,890 --> 03:17:59,130
It's like... Oh, here.

2742
03:18:05,770 --> 03:18:08,710
We ants don't need no... Oh, this way.

2743
03:18:09,450 --> 03:18:10,770
Don't need no trolley.

2744
03:18:10,850 --> 03:18:11,930
Wait, I can go back here.

2745
03:18:12,290 --> 03:18:13,070
Is he still there?

2746
03:18:14,370 --> 03:18:15,790
Wait, it's just them now.

2747
03:18:18,830 --> 03:18:22,230
I know, I know, but like, that was the guy that kidnapped me.

2748
03:18:24,450 --> 03:18:25,170
He was like...

2749
03:18:26,910 --> 03:18:29,210
He was an actual bounty hunter.

2750
03:18:31,110 --> 03:18:32,450
He hunted my bounty.

2751
03:18:38,410 --> 03:18:39,130
Get out of here.

2752
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:50,560
You can finally wall ride.

2753
03:18:54,010 --> 03:18:54,650
There he is.

2754
03:18:55,530 --> 03:18:56,450
Wait, he's evil?

2755
03:18:56,830 --> 03:18:57,890
Wait, is him again?

2756
03:18:59,010 --> 03:19:07,250

03:19:35,230 --> 03:19:36,190
I thought I did.

2760
03:19:36,390 --> 03:19:37,230
I don't remember.

2761
03:19:42,450 --> 03:19:47,010
No, I meant like from like the first thing, the first part.

2762
03:19:49,310 --> 03:19:50,850
Oh, it's at the bench spot.

2763
03:19:51,190 --> 03:19:52,800
Oh, oh my god, where am I?

2764
03:19:55,850 --> 03:19:56,910
Which is easier.

2765
03:19:57,310 --> 03:19:58,090
Give me a sec.

2766
03:19:59,810 --> 03:20:00,630
Okay, this way.

2767
03:20:01,290 --> 03:20:02,330
I gotta do a rug back.

2768
03:20:03,070 --> 03:20:04,030
I didn't realize.

2769
03:20:04,130 --> 03:20:05,790
I was like, there's a merchant right here.

2770
03:20:05,870 --> 03:20:06,930
Wow, he's pretty big.

2771
03:20:06,950 --> 03:20:35,650

2773
03:20:48,990 --> 03:20:57,830
Okay, I'm just gonna heal just in case I did not spend anything Okay, we're gonna take this chair

2774
03:21:03,770 --> 03:21:08,550
That merchant was still in pain And your pace was cashing in on the chest

2775
03:21:13,070 --> 03:21:14,590
Okay, we gotta be careful.

2776
03:21:19,850 --> 03:21:20,650
That's good.

2777
03:21:22,350 --> 03:21:23,330
Where is it?

2778
03:21:23,470 --> 03:21:23,950
This way.

2779
03:21:33,100 --> 03:21:34,060
Okay, chair.

2780
03:21:39,190 --> 03:21:40,650
Oh, there she is.

2781
03:21:40,730 --> 03:21:41,330
Oh, there you are.

2782
03:21:41,730 --> 03:21:42,790
Oh, what a shock.

2783
03:21:43,170 --> 03:21:44,810
Discover it again so easily.

2784
03:21:45,150 --> 03:21:46,770
Like a hapless little hatchling.

2785
03:21:47,210 --> 03:21:48,630
It would make a sport of tackling me.

2786
03:21:48,710 --> 03:21:50,890
I'd have to redouble my effort at camouflage.

2787
03:21:52,430 --> 03:21:53,830
Must return to my observation.

2788
03:21:54,230 --> 03:21:56,530
Try not to lay too much a trail when you leave.

2789
03:21:57,890 --> 03:21:58,650
Okay, where is he?

2790
03:21:58,870 --> 03:21:59,830
Oh, he's up there.

2791
03:22:00,710 --> 03:22:01,230
Oh my god.

2792
03:22:01,510 --> 03:22:04,070
He was in the other little cubby hole.

2793
03:22:04,770 --> 03:22:05,630
Right here.

2794
03:22:07,470 --> 03:22:08,330
Wait, no.

2795
03:22:08,530 --> 03:22:09,070
Where is he?

2796
03:22:10,190 --> 03:22:11,290
He's not here.

2797
03:22:15,050 --> 03:22:15,510

2798
03:22:18,350 --> 03:22:18,810

2799
03:22:23,570 --> 03:22:25,630

My apologies, sir.

2804
03:23:12,890 --> 03:23:17,210
Though I can grasp the language of many bugs, your words are unfamiliar even to me.

2805
03:23:19,810 --> 03:23:23,130
Those items you have collected, these are the warriors of warriors.

2806
03:23:24,050 --> 03:23:25,110
Do you wish to trade?

2807
03:23:27,690 --> 03:23:28,950
All right, what does he have?

2808
03:23:30,110 --> 03:23:33,330
What the fuck are there any... What the...

2809
03:23:33,330 --> 03:23:36,370
Guys, what is a good upgrade?

2810
03:23:37,570 --> 03:23:40,490
I don't know what any of these mean.

2811
03:23:42,010 --> 03:23:43,050
Mask is really good.

2812
03:23:44,150 --> 03:23:45,290
Alright, what does the mask do?

2813
03:23:46,770 --> 03:23:49,250
Shields against critical hits, but shatters.

2814
03:23:50,310 --> 03:23:50,790
Oh!

2815
03:23:51,330 --> 03:23:51,850
Okay.

2816
03:23:53,370 --> 03:23:54,110
Plus one.

2817
03:23:54,250 --> 03:23:54,890
Oh, okay.

2818
03:23:56,310 --> 03:23:57,310
Both are good.

2819
03:23:59,510 --> 03:24:00,710
What is this one?

2820
03:24:00,770 --> 03:24:02,150
I'll just buy it just because I can.

2821
03:24:02,710 --> 03:24:04,170
Well, now I'm pouring out.

2822
03:24:04,850 --> 03:24:05,190
Alright.

2823
03:24:08,370 --> 03:24:10,970
Arch Sharpebone to take down flight.

2824
03:24:11,130 --> 03:24:11,870
Oh my god.

2825
03:24:13,110 --> 03:24:15,550
Finally, my anti-air artillery is here.

2826
03:24:17,950 --> 03:24:19,290
I have anti-air.

2827
03:24:23,940 --> 03:24:25,100
We gotta go to the bench.

2828
03:24:28,320 --> 03:24:30,160
Alright, what should I...

2829
03:24:30,160 --> 03:24:33,120
Put that here.

2830
03:24:34,060 --> 03:24:35,060
That's downward.

2831
03:24:36,040 --> 03:24:37,420
And then...

2832
03:24:37,520 --> 03:24:38,520
That can...

2833
03:24:39,680 --> 03:24:41,280
I'll use this then.

2834
03:24:42,040 --> 03:24:43,520
Where are my other crests?

2835
03:24:43,520 --> 03:24:45,900
Does my other crest give me more stuff I can do?

2836
03:24:46,600 --> 03:24:47,260
2, 2.

2837
03:24:47,340 --> 03:24:48,560
Okay, they're all like the same.

2838
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:51,400
Alright, let's try this out.

2839
03:24:54,780 --> 03:24:56,400
Okay, let's kill that big guy.

2840
03:24:57,040 --> 03:24:58,660
I don't know what he'll give me.

2841
03:25:00,100 --> 03:25:00,840
But we'll see.

2842
03:25:09,490 --> 03:25:09,910
Okay.

2843
03:25:10,130 --> 03:25:11,770
Okay, down!

2844
03:25:12,430 --> 03:25:13,290
Okay, we did it!

2845
03:25:13,310 --> 03:25:14,390
I don't know what happened!

2846
03:25:14,810 --> 03:25:18,130
I don't even know what happened.

2847
03:25:19,530 --> 03:25:20,810
Holy shit.

2848
03:25:23,230 --> 03:25:24,470
There we go.

2849
03:25:26,070 --> 03:25:27,030
Big damage.

2850
03:25:28,330 --> 03:25:28,770
Easy.

2851
03:25:28,910 --> 03:25:29,630
Oh, it's money.

2852
03:25:30,030 --> 03:25:30,230
Nice.

2853
03:25:31,030 --> 03:25:31,950
Worth it.

2854
03:25:32,750 --> 03:25:34,730
He was guarding his treasure.

2855
03:25:35,750 --> 03:25:36,210
Yay!

2856
03:25:36,750 --> 03:25:37,850
Home invasion!

2857
03:25:38,310 --> 03:25:38,730
Let's go!

2858
03:25:38,990 --> 03:25:40,110
Oh my god, let's go!

2859
03:25:40,130 --> 03:25:42,290
Yo, I still...

2860
03:25:42,290 --> 03:25:44,650
I stole their retirement plan.

2861
03:25:46,630 --> 03:25:49,770
This is all the money they plan to use for retiring.

2862
03:25:51,090 --> 03:25:51,430
Yay!

2863
03:25:52,590 --> 03:25:54,130
I got everything back.

2864
03:25:57,210 --> 03:25:58,910
Oh my god, I got my refund.

2865
03:26:03,890 --> 03:26:05,090
Their 401k.

2866
03:26:07,330 --> 03:26:08,410
Hey, they don't need it anymore.

2867
03:26:09,030 --> 03:26:11,310
I blinked and missed the fight.

2868
03:26:12,170 --> 03:26:13,370
What are you gonna do with it?

2869
03:26:13,770 --> 03:26:15,750
Anyway, the dead cat used that money.

2870
03:26:16,230 --> 03:26:18,070
Oh, it was so unfortunate that he died.

2871
03:26:18,750 --> 03:26:19,970
How do I upgrade the boomerang?

2872
03:26:21,090 --> 03:26:22,250
Well, I can upgrade it?

2873
03:26:22,410 --> 03:26:22,730
How?

2874
03:26:27,730 --> 03:26:30,990
Yeah, don't have to worry about retiring when they're dead.

2875
03:26:32,090 --> 03:26:33,510
Go to Firefields.

2876
03:26:34,670 --> 03:26:35,310
Oh, is it much?

2877
03:26:35,370 --> 03:26:36,470
Oh, it's Act 3 only.

2878
03:26:36,910 --> 03:26:37,650
Okay, nice.

2879
03:26:38,190 --> 03:26:39,250
Alright, we got to...

2880
03:26:39,250 --> 03:26:40,070
We can find...

2881
03:26:40,070 --> 03:26:42,710
The filler episode can finally end.

2882
03:26:42,950 --> 03:26:45,150
Now we can get back to the real place.

2883
03:26:45,170 --> 03:26:58,230
lot okay we got everything we need all right now go this way

2884
03:27:02,000 --> 03:28:22,080

2885
03:28:22,080 --> 03:28:37,100

2886
03:28:40,600 --> 03:29:32,420

2887
03:29:36,960 --> 03:29:40,860
I was like I was like Like, that's so fucked up.

2888
03:29:47,460 --> 03:29:53,880
It's like, see, if you give your speeches long enough, you're literally taking money from children.

2889
03:29:55,440 --> 03:29:57,620
There goes your chemo, Jimmy.

2890
03:30:00,820 --> 03:30:03,560
Scarlett Johansson decided to thank her mom and dad.

2891
03:30:03,920 --> 03:30:06,000
And now that's minus $5,000.

2892
03:30:06,560 --> 03:30:07,920
Goodbye to your chemo.

2893
03:30:09,440 --> 03:30:11,320
Like, that's so crazy.

2894
03:30:11,840 --> 03:30:13,260
Actual extortion.

2895
03:30:17,180 --> 03:30:18,340
Alright, let's see.

2896
03:30:18,620 --> 03:30:19,140
880?

2897
03:30:19,680 --> 03:30:20,500
Oh my gosh.

2898
03:30:20,660 --> 03:30:21,900
Alright, I can afford that, though.

2899
03:30:22,540 --> 03:30:24,540
I really have...

2900
03:30:25,360 --> 03:30:27,060
Wait, what tool does it go on?

2901
03:30:27,340 --> 03:30:28,140
It's on blue.

2902
03:30:28,280 --> 03:30:29,140
Okay, what do I have?

2903
03:30:33,350 --> 03:30:35,630
Oh, wait, I can't...

2904
03:30:37,270 --> 03:30:39,590
Oh, that sucks.

2905
03:30:39,790 --> 03:30:40,030
Okay.

2906
03:30:40,630 --> 03:30:41,690
I guess, ah, fine.

2907
03:30:41,790 --> 03:30:43,050
I guess I'll donate to LA.

2908
03:30:48,190 --> 03:30:48,990
Fine, LA.

2909
03:30:49,570 --> 03:30:51,150
You can take my money.

2910
03:30:53,750 --> 03:30:54,150
Fine.

2911
03:30:55,310 --> 03:30:56,110
I guess.

2912
03:30:57,790 --> 03:30:59,210
Alright, let's go to...

2913
03:30:59,210 --> 03:31:01,010
Let's go to Citadel now.

2914
03:31:03,110 --> 03:31:03,430
Oh, wait.

2915
03:31:03,450 --> 03:31:04,070
Is there a spool?

2916
03:31:04,210 --> 03:31:05,130
I didn't even see the spool.

2917
03:31:07,030 --> 03:31:08,770
The rich get richer.

2918
03:31:09,870 --> 03:31:10,610
Oh, there is a spool.

2919
03:31:10,630 --> 03:31:11,410
Oh, I didn't even see that.

2920
03:31:16,180 --> 03:31:16,960
Did any more wishes?

2921
03:31:17,180 --> 03:31:17,380
No.

2922
03:31:17,760 --> 03:31:19,060
Alright, let's just go.

2923
03:31:21,080 --> 03:31:22,860
Alright, where do I have to do at the Citadel?

2924
03:31:25,660 --> 03:31:27,640
Can I see a free blue slot from the spot?

2925
03:31:27,680 --> 03:31:28,580
Oh, yeah.

2926
03:31:29,040 --> 03:31:30,960
I don't know if I have...

2927
03:31:30,960 --> 03:31:32,780
I don't know if I have...

2928
03:31:34,040 --> 03:31:34,440
Um...

2929
03:31:34,440 --> 03:31:36,980
I don't know if I've been locked in a memory, though.

2930
03:31:37,340 --> 03:31:37,740
Whatever.

2931
03:31:37,960 --> 03:31:39,100
We'll figure that out later.

2932
03:31:39,900 --> 03:31:41,360
Alright, last six steps.

2933
03:31:42,340 --> 03:31:42,840
No, I don't know.

2934
03:31:42,860 --> 03:31:49,180
I did all the wishes for the downstairs, the poor people, and the rich, too.

2935
03:31:51,240 --> 03:31:53,620
I did all the stuff for the poor and the rich.

2936
03:31:54,340 --> 03:31:55,400
All right, now where do we go?

2937
03:31:55,860 --> 03:31:57,080
Oh, I'm sorry, little Tim.

2938
03:31:57,120 --> 03:31:58,740
Tom, we didn't have enough for your heart surgery.

2939
03:31:58,900 --> 03:32:00,820
The millionaire gave him the speech for your recovery.

2940
03:32:00,960 --> 03:32:04,700
Talk for 45, 55 seconds instead of 45.

2941
03:32:05,200 --> 03:32:08,080
So we were just a couple of bucks short.

2942
03:32:08,360 --> 03:32:10,320
Thank you for the super chat, banana.

2943
03:32:10,540 --> 03:32:12,000
Thank you, thank you.

2944
03:32:12,860 --> 03:32:15,020
Basically, I was like, that's looking crazy.

2945
03:32:15,800 --> 03:32:16,820
Holy fuck.

2946
03:32:17,980 --> 03:32:19,100
Alright, Grandgate.

2947
03:32:21,380 --> 03:32:23,240
He just had to...

2948
03:32:23,240 --> 03:32:26,080
He just had to thank God, you know?

2949
03:32:27,440 --> 03:32:29,800
Is that crazy to think about?

2950
03:32:31,960 --> 03:32:34,800
Oh my God, I forgot about this area.

2951
03:32:38,440 --> 03:32:40,120
Oh, I forgot about this.

2952
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:41,560
I thought you were on the board.

2953
03:32:41,700 --> 03:32:42,680
I nearly killed.

2954
03:32:42,860 --> 03:32:45,160
I literally killed your manager.

2955
03:32:45,660 --> 03:32:46,740
Oh, my God.

2956
03:32:50,240 --> 03:32:51,840
I don't understand.

2957
03:32:52,080 --> 03:32:53,360
How are you still alive?

2958
03:33:01,620 --> 03:33:02,580
All right, here we go.

2959
03:33:05,200 --> 03:33:05,780
Oh, my God.

2960
03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:07,280
I forgot that one was fake.

2961
03:33:09,780 --> 03:33:10,500
All right.

2962
03:33:15,730 --> 03:33:18,230
We live in a dystopia.

2963
03:33:18,590 --> 03:33:21,090
I missed when...

2964
03:33:21,090 --> 03:33:21,910
Remember the day...

2965
03:33:21,910 --> 03:33:24,930
Do you remember back then when the orchestra just played you out?

2966
03:33:28,230 --> 03:33:29,910
It was really good.

2967
03:33:30,010 --> 03:33:33,210
The fact that those were the good old days.

2968
03:33:37,290 --> 03:33:39,250
Alright, what do we do here?

2969
03:33:41,630 --> 03:33:43,610
And the word for most children.

2970
03:33:45,010 --> 03:33:46,510
Thank you for the super chat.

2971
03:33:46,710 --> 03:33:46,830
Thank you.

2972
03:33:47,210 --> 03:33:47,910
Thank you.

2973
03:33:50,010 --> 03:33:50,850
Oh, bad?

2974
03:33:51,390 --> 03:33:51,910
Oh,

2975
03:33:56,050 --> 03:33:56,610
I can hit it?

2976
03:33:56,790 --> 03:33:58,430
Oh, I didn't realize I can hit it.

2977
03:33:59,030 --> 03:33:59,670
Oh, sweet.

2978
03:34:03,780 --> 03:34:04,260
Okay.

2979
03:34:05,400 --> 03:34:07,120
Whoops, I fucked that up.

2980
03:34:10,000 --> 03:34:10,520
Oops.

2981
03:34:14,530 --> 03:34:15,050
Okay.

2982
03:34:18,430 --> 03:34:20,030
Okay, I gotta hit this one.

2983
03:34:20,330 --> 03:34:21,290
Because I messed it up.

2984
03:34:28,440 --> 03:34:29,560
I already do it here.

2985
03:34:34,490 --> 03:34:37,830
Oh, I have to hit this skill.

2986
03:34:41,110 --> 03:34:41,930
What the fuck?

2987
03:34:51,680 --> 03:34:52,040
Eh.

2988
03:34:54,260 --> 03:34:55,100
Should I figure out?

2989
03:34:55,760 --> 03:34:56,140
Oh my.

2990
03:34:57,280 --> 03:34:58,280
Hit too small.

2991
03:34:59,100 --> 03:35:00,620
Hit too small.

2992
03:35:02,100 --> 03:35:03,000
Let's see.

2993
03:35:04,640 --> 03:35:06,220
How do I...

2994
03:35:06,220 --> 03:35:07,340
Did I mess it up?

2995
03:35:09,800 --> 03:35:11,400
I think I messed it up.

2996
03:35:17,070 --> 03:35:18,890
There we go.

2997
03:35:24,930 --> 03:35:25,770
There we go.

2998
03:35:27,910 --> 03:35:30,250
I did it.

2999
03:35:38,330 --> 03:35:39,870
Jesus, this is annoying.

3000
03:35:45,410 --> 03:35:47,910
Zoom it this way and then...

3001
03:35:47,910 --> 03:35:48,650
Alright, there we go.

3002
03:35:48,990 --> 03:35:50,930
Holy fuck, that was an annoying one.

3003
03:35:52,250 --> 03:35:52,610
Whoa!

3004
03:35:53,270 --> 03:35:54,310
More silk though.

3005
03:35:56,550 --> 03:35:57,410
More silk.

3006
03:35:58,610 --> 03:35:59,670
Got another upgrade.

3007
03:36:00,550 --> 03:36:02,250
That was so annoying.

3008
03:36:02,670 --> 03:36:03,270
Holy shit.

3009
03:36:04,170 --> 03:36:05,050
There's nothing here.

3010
03:36:06,690 --> 03:36:07,610
That's it, right?

3011
03:36:10,550 --> 03:36:10,930
Wee!

3012
03:36:14,750 --> 03:36:17,210
I'm just like real Jane Silksa.

3013
03:36:18,090 --> 03:36:18,910
Oh my god, here.

3014
03:36:20,810 --> 03:36:23,210
Oh my god, I almost forgot about that place.

3015
03:36:27,150 --> 03:36:29,470
Down into the right here.

3016
03:36:32,470 --> 03:36:33,810
Where's I go up?

3017
03:36:41,810 --> 03:36:46,290
Oh, I don't know where to go now.

3018
03:36:47,050 --> 03:36:47,670
I don't know.

3019
03:36:49,330 --> 03:36:51,030
Now you go up.

3020
03:36:51,370 --> 03:36:51,830
I'm up.

3021
03:36:52,430 --> 03:36:53,190
This is not up.

3022
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:00,620
Okay, I already did this area.

3023
03:37:01,060 --> 03:37:01,320
Okay.

3024
03:37:02,120 --> 03:37:03,500
Man, if only I have a map.

3025
03:37:06,220 --> 03:37:07,400
Am I going the right way?

3026
03:37:07,580 --> 03:37:08,580
It's so confusing.

3027
03:37:10,460 --> 03:37:12,220
Okay, I unlocked this area.

3028
03:37:12,240 --> 03:37:14,660
I remember.

3029
03:37:19,930 --> 03:37:20,570
There's a bet.

3030
03:37:20,790 --> 03:37:21,110
Oh my god.

3031
03:37:21,290 --> 03:37:23,510
But is it a free bench or is it pay to sit?

3032
03:37:24,850 --> 03:37:26,050
I'll never know.

3033
03:37:30,110 --> 03:37:31,390
What's over here?

3034
03:37:32,450 --> 03:37:32,830
Hello.

3035
03:37:33,870 --> 03:37:34,870
Oh my god.

3036
03:37:35,230 --> 03:37:39,190
I thought like something's like this room's gonna crush me.

3037
03:37:44,270 --> 03:37:44,330
Alright.

3038
03:37:44,470 --> 03:37:44,990
Money.

3039
03:37:48,240 --> 03:37:49,140
That just scared me.

3040
03:37:49,320 --> 03:37:50,220
I was gonna get crushed.

3041
03:37:52,380 --> 03:37:54,280
Yeah, nothing comes for free here.

3042
03:37:57,440 --> 03:37:58,400
Is this a bench?

3043
03:37:59,400 --> 03:38:00,820
Oh, no, it's a...

3044
03:38:00,820 --> 03:38:01,520
It's a map.

3045
03:38:04,300 --> 03:38:05,140
Map time!

3046
03:38:06,680 --> 03:38:07,740
What do I get?

3047
03:38:08,800 --> 03:38:09,340
Hello?

3048
03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:11,540
Oh, there it is.

3049
03:38:11,660 --> 03:38:12,520
Oh, my god.

3050
03:38:13,880 --> 03:38:14,960
Oh, my...

3051
03:38:14,960 --> 03:38:15,580
Oh, my...

3052
03:38:15,580 --> 03:38:15,780
Okay.

3053
03:38:16,900 --> 03:38:17,900
Oh, my god.

3054
03:38:18,120 --> 03:38:18,600
Okay.

3055
03:38:19,320 --> 03:38:21,440
Oh my, oh wow.

3056
03:38:22,940 --> 03:38:23,440
Oh wow.

3057
03:38:24,500 --> 03:38:27,220
It's like, that's quite big.

3058
03:38:30,560 --> 03:38:33,480
Wow, this place, it's pretty big, guys.

3059
03:38:33,980 --> 03:38:34,720
Holy shit.

3060
03:38:35,460 --> 03:38:39,400
Yeah, that's, it's like it's a citadel or some shit.

3061
03:38:39,540 --> 03:38:41,040
I don't know.

3062
03:38:42,860 --> 03:38:43,540
Holy shit.

3063
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:46,760
It's like it's some kind of citadel.

3064
03:38:46,760 --> 03:38:49,980
Oh, wait, there's more.

3065
03:38:55,390 --> 03:38:57,590
Oh, these guys.

3066
03:39:00,390 --> 03:39:00,970
Alright.

3067
03:39:03,630 --> 03:39:04,290
Chair?

3068
03:39:06,070 --> 03:39:07,210
Any chairs here?

3069
03:39:08,130 --> 03:39:10,930
Oh, this looks like a boss fight.

3070
03:39:13,370 --> 03:39:15,010
Oh, my god!

3071
03:39:16,090 --> 03:39:16,570
Okay.

3072
03:39:17,790 --> 03:39:18,770
Yeah, I want to heal.

3073
03:39:21,350 --> 03:39:21,870
This...

3074
03:39:21,870 --> 03:39:23,670
Oh, this looks...

3075
03:39:23,670 --> 03:39:25,870
It looks so open.

3076
03:39:26,010 --> 03:39:27,230
I don't know.

3077
03:39:31,310 --> 03:39:33,670
Oh, that looks like such an open area.

3078
03:39:33,810 --> 03:39:34,390
I don't know.

3079
03:39:35,210 --> 03:39:36,250
It looks...

3080
03:39:36,250 --> 03:39:39,050
It looks very boss-like.

3081
03:39:42,310 --> 03:39:44,190
Looks very, very open.

3082
03:39:44,470 --> 03:39:45,650
As if something's gonna...

3083
03:39:45,650 --> 03:39:46,190
Oh, wait, nice.

3084
03:39:46,530 --> 03:39:46,530
Okay.

3085
03:39:46,950 --> 03:39:48,630
But thank God it wasn't a boss area.

3086
03:39:49,590 --> 03:39:50,370
Oh, never mind.

3087
03:39:50,530 --> 03:39:50,790
Hello.

3088
03:39:51,030 --> 03:39:54,350
I spoke too soon.

3089
03:39:55,390 --> 03:39:56,450
Oh, what's this?

3090
03:39:56,730 --> 03:39:59,130
The little spider climbs so high.

3091
03:39:59,710 --> 03:40:02,770
Here to stand a quiver at our starling citadel?

3092
03:40:03,190 --> 03:40:03,410
No.

3093
03:40:03,870 --> 03:40:09,050
Pale child, you return only the mock that I knew nor lad have proven my match.

3094
03:40:09,410 --> 03:40:11,290
The sleeping citadel shall be no different.

3095
03:40:11,850 --> 03:40:13,230
The spider, dear.

3096
03:40:14,070 --> 03:40:17,830
Why must he remain so distressingly optimistic?

3097
03:40:18,630 --> 03:40:24,990
The power that waits above you cannot conceive her who would snuff the hope with barely a glance.

3098
03:40:25,790 --> 03:40:30,970
Fool, child, you still think me blind to the form of your liege, having come this far?

3099
03:40:31,610 --> 03:40:35,730
This lands grandeur, the devotion of its bugs, and the curse that befalls them.

3100
03:40:36,110 --> 03:40:37,310
The signs are clear.

3101
03:40:37,430 --> 03:40:43,390
Your kingdom is in the thrall of a creature beyond bug, one of that higher caste.

3102
03:40:43,770 --> 03:40:45,730
What if it's desired for my silk and my shell?

3103
03:40:46,050 --> 03:40:48,050
It shall find I'm quite attached to both.

3104
03:40:50,110 --> 03:40:57,770
Marvelous, so that Spider knows something of fathomless beings, and still it hopes to stand against one, a god.

3105
03:40:58,970 --> 03:41:01,630
Where do you hide this fathomless strength you claim, Spider?

3106
03:41:02,190 --> 03:41:04,090
I've watched your struggle towards us.

3107
03:41:04,410 --> 03:41:06,210
Yours was a painful, broken trek.

3108
03:41:06,670 --> 03:41:09,330
One needs grace to stand before it's a divine.

3109
03:41:10,190 --> 03:41:12,150
Then best you keep watching, child.

3110
03:41:12,570 --> 03:41:16,330
I found those who claim this as a god can rarely match the title.

3111
03:41:16,630 --> 03:41:18,670
Do you know who my father is?

3112
03:41:19,950 --> 03:41:22,610
He's basically a god himself.

3113
03:41:23,630 --> 03:41:27,050
And the experience tells me, even gods can fall.

3114
03:41:27,350 --> 03:41:30,970
Yeah, and my father is technically dead too.

3115
03:41:35,810 --> 03:41:36,110
Alright.

3116
03:41:37,170 --> 03:41:38,150
So I know.

3117
03:41:38,330 --> 03:41:40,030
Yeah, I know that gods can die.

3118
03:41:40,110 --> 03:41:42,010
Because my father is dead.

3119
03:41:44,990 --> 03:41:45,490
Oh, shit.

3120
03:41:48,590 --> 03:41:49,670
Oh, my God.

3121
03:41:49,950 --> 03:41:50,950
Where am I?

3122
03:41:57,870 --> 03:41:59,670
Nice flex.

3123
03:42:00,970 --> 03:42:02,610
All right, nice.

3124
03:42:05,550 --> 03:42:07,210
Okay, oh.

3125
03:42:08,890 --> 03:42:09,890
All right.

3126
03:42:11,690 --> 03:42:12,690
All right.

3127
03:42:13,590 --> 03:42:15,170
Okay, so...

3128
03:42:15,170 --> 03:42:15,990
What the fuck?

3129
03:42:16,890 --> 03:42:18,110
Okay, nice.

3130
03:42:18,250 --> 03:42:18,970
I can heal here.

3131
03:42:19,470 --> 03:42:19,790
When?

3132
03:42:24,590 --> 03:42:26,750
Jesus, they're so tanky.

3133
03:42:27,950 --> 03:42:29,690
Wait, they're so tanky.

3134
03:42:29,770 --> 03:42:31,290
Oh, chairs to the right here?

3135
03:42:36,300 --> 03:42:38,340
You guys have so much HP.

3136
03:42:40,280 --> 03:42:42,300
Okay, I'll go grab a chair.

3137
03:42:43,280 --> 03:42:43,820
What's this?

3138
03:42:45,160 --> 03:42:45,920
Okay, well.

3139
03:42:46,980 --> 03:42:48,220
I guess no chair.

3140
03:42:48,820 --> 03:42:50,520
I guess.

3141
03:42:50,960 --> 03:42:51,700
Oh, alright.

3142
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:53,780
No chair for me, I guess.

3143
03:42:57,200 --> 03:42:58,520
Oh, what's this?

3144
03:42:59,500 --> 03:43:00,640
Yeah, it looked like it could break.

3145
03:43:02,440 --> 03:43:04,020
There's a room here.

3146
03:43:05,080 --> 03:43:05,440
Hello?

3147
03:43:07,620 --> 03:43:08,900
Anything here?

3148
03:43:10,520 --> 03:43:10,800
Oh.

3149
03:43:11,740 --> 03:43:13,000
What's up here?

3150
03:43:14,360 --> 03:43:14,880
Secret.

3151
03:43:16,860 --> 03:43:17,440
Oh, nice.

3152
03:43:17,640 --> 03:43:17,900
Money.

3153
03:43:19,120 --> 03:43:20,160
His final...

3154
03:43:20,160 --> 03:43:21,600
His final...

3155
03:43:21,600 --> 03:43:21,980
Death...

3156
03:43:22,660 --> 03:43:25,540
Death wish for me to take his money.

3157
03:43:30,300 --> 03:43:33,920
He's like his most prized possession and I'm like, yoink?

3158
03:43:35,920 --> 03:43:37,160
Mine now.

3159
03:43:38,880 --> 03:43:40,120
Oh, goodbye.

3160
03:43:43,920 --> 03:43:45,100
Like, thank God.

3161
03:43:45,720 --> 03:43:47,700
Thank God no one will take my money.

3162
03:43:48,300 --> 03:43:50,260
I'm like, our money.

3163
03:43:53,380 --> 03:43:54,820
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3164
03:43:54,960 --> 03:43:56,120
I'm just gonna heal actually.

3165
03:44:03,930 --> 03:44:05,450
Holy shit, they're so annoying.

3166
03:44:08,310 --> 03:44:09,050
That's it!

3167
03:44:09,390 --> 03:44:09,730
That's it!

3168
03:44:11,030 --> 03:44:11,390
That's it!

3169
03:44:13,630 --> 03:44:14,350
That's it!

3170
03:44:16,010 --> 03:44:17,090
I'm gonna throw this.

3171
03:44:17,690 --> 03:44:18,570
I can't be bothered.

3172
03:44:19,870 --> 03:44:21,270
Very annoying bugs.

3173
03:44:24,090 --> 03:44:25,930
I'm bringing out the boomerang.

3174
03:44:28,270 --> 03:44:30,030
There we go, there's the chair.

3175
03:44:31,850 --> 03:44:33,450
Oh my god, a free chair.

3176
03:44:33,830 --> 03:44:34,710
That's crazy.

3177
03:44:34,890 --> 03:44:36,770
I haven't seen free things in so long.

3178
03:44:41,480 --> 03:44:42,900
What's down here?

3179
03:44:45,820 --> 03:44:46,460
Hello?

3180
03:44:46,920 --> 03:44:47,680
Oh, shit!

3181
03:44:49,700 --> 03:44:50,780
What is he doing there?

3182
03:44:52,660 --> 03:44:54,500
Okay, this way.

3183
03:44:57,520 --> 03:44:58,660
Actual chair.

3184
03:45:00,920 --> 03:45:02,440
Don't have to pay for it.

3185
03:45:05,460 --> 03:45:06,900
What is over here?

3186
03:45:11,620 --> 03:45:13,480
Is his home?

3187
03:45:14,880 --> 03:45:17,300
He lives there, Doki.

3188
03:45:20,990 --> 03:45:22,250
What's that?

3189
03:45:22,870 --> 03:45:23,850
Oh my god, steampunk.

3190
03:45:25,270 --> 03:45:27,250
Your steampunk bugged down too?

3191
03:45:29,890 --> 03:45:31,570
Where the fuck am I?

3192
03:45:32,870 --> 03:45:35,730
Good kid.

3193
03:45:36,850 --> 03:45:37,570
Oh shit!

3194
03:45:37,890 --> 03:45:38,270
Okay, good.

3195
03:45:38,290 --> 03:45:40,550
You know what grinds my gears?

3196
03:45:43,850 --> 03:45:45,490
That's a robo bug.

3197
03:45:46,050 --> 03:45:46,470
What is he?

3198
03:45:46,590 --> 03:45:47,670
What are they doing there?

3199
03:45:49,490 --> 03:45:51,310
They can make robots now?

3200
03:45:51,790 --> 03:45:53,570
Oh my god, I was not expecting

3201
03:45:57,150 --> 03:46:13,570
Yeah, we got we got firemen for silk though There you go Friend friends they work here What are they doing in my way?

3202
03:46:16,210 --> 03:46:19,990
Joki, they're just trying to clock in for their nine to five.

3203
03:46:20,490 --> 03:46:22,490
Just trying to make some money.

3204
03:46:24,270 --> 03:46:24,970
What the fuck?

3205
03:46:35,570 --> 03:46:36,190
Yeah, I knew it.

3206
03:46:36,290 --> 03:46:38,290
I knew you were going to come back alive.

3207
03:46:46,050 --> 03:46:46,470
Okay, nice.

3208
03:46:46,530 --> 03:46:47,390
You don't have wings.

3209
03:46:48,530 --> 03:46:48,750
What?

3210
03:46:52,990 --> 03:46:54,410
Oh, nice.

3211
03:46:54,610 --> 03:46:55,790
I got your silk, though.

3212
03:46:56,110 --> 03:46:56,690
Got your silk.

3213
03:46:57,830 --> 03:46:58,510
I

3214
03:47:02,280 --> 03:47:03,880
thought I was special!

3215
03:47:06,460 --> 03:47:08,380
I thought I was special!

3216
03:47:11,120 --> 03:47:13,700
What do you mean they can also do that?

3217
03:47:14,600 --> 03:47:15,720
What's the point?

3218
03:47:20,840 --> 03:47:24,540
If everybody is special, no one is special.

3219
03:47:29,620 --> 03:47:31,360
How can I be Jameson?

3220
03:47:31,380 --> 03:47:34,240
Silk Song if they can all be Jane Silk Song.

3221
03:47:36,000 --> 03:47:37,380
Alright, I guess I go up.

3222
03:47:43,100 --> 03:47:44,460
What does this do?

3223
03:47:48,600 --> 03:47:49,120
Whoa!

3224
03:47:52,930 --> 03:47:53,650
Wait, what?

3225
03:47:56,010 --> 03:47:58,070
Oh, I just locked myself out.

3226
03:48:06,270 --> 03:48:07,910
God, these guys are so annoying.

3227
03:48:08,410 --> 03:48:11,910
I think I don't like these enemies the most so far.

3228
03:48:13,710 --> 03:48:14,130
When?

3229
03:48:18,190 --> 03:48:19,850
Zeek, thank you for the super chat.

3230
03:48:20,050 --> 03:48:20,530
Thank you, thank you.

3231
03:48:20,590 --> 03:48:22,070
Good morning from Germany, everybody.

3232
03:48:22,890 --> 03:48:23,430
Good morning.

3233
03:48:24,270 --> 03:48:24,630
Wait, what?

3234
03:48:24,690 --> 03:48:25,790
Oh, this gives me silk.

3235
03:48:27,110 --> 03:48:28,550
Okay, I don't need silk, though.

3236
03:48:29,510 --> 03:48:30,070
Should be fine.

3237
03:48:31,070 --> 03:48:31,870
So far.

3238
03:48:32,110 --> 03:48:32,450
Yeah.

3239
03:48:35,510 --> 03:48:37,310
Oh my god, they do two damage.

3240
03:48:39,270 --> 03:48:40,910
Okay, I just don't- I'm scared of.

3241
03:48:41,930 --> 03:48:42,890
Okay, that's it.

3242
03:48:43,030 --> 03:48:44,310
It's just a silk machine.

3243
03:48:45,010 --> 03:48:46,670
I guess that's it.

3244
03:48:48,870 --> 03:48:51,070
It's just a silk machine.

3245
03:48:54,170 --> 03:48:54,210
Dead.

3246
03:48:59,910 --> 03:49:00,850
Are you serious?

3247
03:49:02,370 --> 03:49:03,250
Alright, I'm just gonna leave.

3248
03:49:05,290 --> 03:49:05,710
Anything here?

3249
03:49:06,250 --> 03:49:07,010
Oh shit!

3250
03:49:07,330 --> 03:49:07,750
Steam.

3251
03:49:09,310 --> 03:49:12,010
I got a farmer for silk, actually.

3252
03:49:15,130 --> 03:49:16,150
Oh my god, please.

3253
03:49:16,430 --> 03:49:16,850
No!

3254
03:49:17,430 --> 03:49:18,150
Oh my god!

3255
03:49:21,680 --> 03:49:22,240
No!

3256
03:49:22,980 --> 03:49:24,180
No, I get better!

3257
03:49:24,980 --> 03:49:26,180
Oh my god, I gotta pay.

3258
03:49:26,540 --> 03:49:28,420
Actually, I gotta...

3259
03:49:28,420 --> 03:49:30,720
I gotta contribute to super capitalism.

3260
03:49:31,520 --> 03:49:32,640
I need...

3261
03:49:32,640 --> 03:49:34,360
Oh my... Okay, there we go.

3262
03:49:34,680 --> 03:49:35,100
There we go.

3263
03:49:35,520 --> 03:49:36,940
Oh my god, it's not even enough.

3264
03:49:39,040 --> 03:49:40,580
It wasn't even enough.

3265
03:49:40,900 --> 03:49:42,140
It wasn't even enough.

3266
03:49:45,520 --> 03:49:47,640
I don't even have enough.

3267
03:49:48,720 --> 03:49:49,500
There we go.

3268
03:49:51,180 --> 03:49:53,700
I'm paying it over silk.

3269
03:49:54,300 --> 03:49:55,960
I can't...

3270
03:49:55,960 --> 03:49:58,720
I'd rather pay for silk than die to her.

3271
03:50:00,240 --> 03:50:03,400
My ego and reputation was on the line.

3272
03:50:10,710 --> 03:50:11,510
Okay.

3273
03:50:12,210 --> 03:50:14,530
I ironically had to pay...

3274
03:50:14,530 --> 03:50:16,070
I'm part of the problem.

3275
03:50:16,670 --> 03:50:17,110
I...

3276
03:50:19,950 --> 03:50:23,950
I shall be part of the problem and contribute to it.

3277
03:50:29,450 --> 03:50:30,630
What's this?

3278
03:50:33,330 --> 03:50:34,190
What's over here?

3279
03:50:36,630 --> 03:50:36,990
Hello?

3280
03:50:38,070 --> 03:50:39,970
Gung, gung, gung.

3281
03:50:42,870 --> 03:50:43,930
Oh, it's a bench.

3282
03:50:51,620 --> 03:50:55,540
Look, it was I paid for silk or died to a fucking pilgrim.

3283
03:51:00,670 --> 03:51:02,350
Hey, bench time.

3284
03:51:05,050 --> 03:51:05,490
Okay.

3285
03:51:10,450 --> 03:51:12,450
I skipped a bench and a bell.

3286
03:51:13,350 --> 03:51:14,550
Boy, am I you there?

3287
03:51:16,190 --> 03:51:19,630
Hell, I see you wasn't wearing that great clang bell just now.

3288
03:51:19,990 --> 03:51:22,090
Right when I'm trying to get some sleep.

3289
03:51:23,630 --> 03:51:24,090
Oh, hello.

3290
03:51:25,030 --> 03:51:28,030
Hamiddi, you dota, you shifty little bell-runger.

3291
03:51:28,430 --> 03:51:31,790
You have chosen a curious place to rest, sir.

3292
03:51:32,050 --> 03:51:35,610
Do you perhaps know something of the shrine and its companions in the lands below?

3293
03:51:36,450 --> 03:51:37,830
No, so you ask.

3294
03:51:37,930 --> 03:51:40,570
funny questions as well as cutting bells free, eh?

3295
03:51:41,010 --> 03:51:42,270
You certainly ain't a pilgrim.

3296
03:51:42,610 --> 03:51:44,070
You're clearly not the choir.

3297
03:51:44,590 --> 03:51:45,910
I don't know.

3298
03:51:46,210 --> 03:51:48,090
I know exactly what you are.

3299
03:51:49,010 --> 03:51:50,230
A bell ringing loud.

3300
03:51:50,550 --> 03:51:51,370
A weirdo.

3301
03:51:51,670 --> 03:51:53,170
Don't you realize what you've done?

3302
03:51:53,510 --> 03:51:54,830
Waking that shrine back up.

3303
03:51:55,130 --> 03:51:58,410
Guys, he came from a different time, okay?

3304
03:51:59,950 --> 03:52:01,250
Oh, good job.

3305
03:52:01,550 --> 03:52:02,810
He came from back then.

3306
03:52:02,870 --> 03:52:04,770
He was able to say that, okay.

3307
03:52:06,750 --> 03:52:10,250
The bell Has run out far and wide.

3308
03:52:10,810 --> 03:52:13,890
The wretched and the lost will have heard his call.

3309
03:52:14,170 --> 03:52:15,870
They'll be making a way here now.

3310
03:52:16,430 --> 03:52:17,970
Well, what's done is done.

3311
03:52:18,170 --> 03:52:19,690
And what's run is run.

3312
03:52:20,030 --> 03:52:22,210
Just make sure you come back here soon, you lout.

3313
03:52:22,730 --> 03:52:24,330
Oh my god, sir.

3314
03:52:27,590 --> 03:52:29,550
You can help me deal with all the...

3315
03:52:29,550 --> 03:52:30,390
Whoa!

3316
03:52:33,830 --> 03:52:35,970
Guys, he's just a boomer, guys.

3317
03:52:36,150 --> 03:52:37,610
He came from a different time.

3318
03:52:37,750 --> 03:52:41,110
He was allowed to say that back then.

3319
03:52:42,290 --> 03:52:45,050
And desperate scavengers who turn up.

3320
03:52:45,570 --> 03:52:46,910
Oh my god, Grandpa.

3321
03:52:47,810 --> 03:52:50,330
The shrine awakened and calls out to him.

3322
03:52:50,510 --> 03:52:51,570
You see, it's safe here.

3323
03:52:51,690 --> 03:52:52,230
Come over.

3324
03:52:52,570 --> 03:52:54,470
Ring the ears of every lost pilgrim.

3325
03:52:54,610 --> 03:53:00,350
Grubby so and so unlucky enough to have made it to this blast to this blasted citadel with her wits intact.

You don't understand.

3416
04:01:14,130 --> 04:01:16,490

Guys, you don't understand.

3428
04:02:08,750 --> 04:02:13,070

04:08:36,770 --> 04:08:38,250
They're just jealous.

3496
04:08:38,710 --> 04:08:39,390
Not jealous.

3497
04:08:39,990 --> 04:08:41,330
I don't need that.

3498
04:08:41,410 --> 04:08:42,510
I don't need happiness.

3499
04:08:43,110 --> 04:08:44,250
I don't need it.

3500
04:08:48,690 --> 04:09:16,310
Pilgrim of Fireloom Eternal Your rare chosen Who have ascended to this final threshold Listen to our wish Deliver it That you may rise above And see your pilgrimage end That's jealous I just don't like it When they hold hands And that chosen were How happy they are That they're together Like keep it inside You know Keep it in home Don't give me your PDA.

3501
04:09:19,750 --> 04:09:23,290
We can hear the song of the architects at the core of the citadel.

3502
04:09:23,650 --> 04:09:28,730
They who sustain our realm, its walls, its floors, and its voice, even as others fall silent.

3503
04:09:30,830 --> 04:09:33,930
We'll hear the voice of the keepers within their grand vaults.

3504
04:09:35,030 --> 04:09:38,390
They who guard our history, our prayers, and our secrets across the ages.

3505
04:09:39,010 --> 04:09:40,510
Yeah, get a room.

3506
04:09:41,910 --> 04:09:44,070
Don't show your love to me.

3507
04:09:45,530 --> 04:09:46,630
That's our seat.

3508
04:09:46,750 --> 04:09:47,930
Dad agrees.

3509
04:09:51,490 --> 04:09:53,370
We would hear the melody of the conductors.

3510
04:09:53,570 --> 04:09:55,210
High in their gleaming towers.

3511
04:09:55,930 --> 04:09:57,850
They bearing the heaviest mantle.

3512
04:09:58,250 --> 04:09:59,630
Who would guide our lands.

3513
04:10:00,110 --> 04:10:01,470
Ever on to greatness.

3514
04:10:02,910 --> 04:10:05,050
This is their room.

3515
04:10:06,050 --> 04:10:07,850
Go find a different room.

3516
04:10:08,010 --> 04:10:09,510
It's my room now.

3517
04:10:10,490 --> 04:10:12,470
He'll get my fire loom eternal.

04:12:45,000 --> 04:12:46,200
I wish I have a map.

3522
04:12:47,120 --> 04:12:49,040
Every day I ask that of myself.

3523
04:12:50,300 --> 04:12:51,920
When will I ever get a map?

3524
04:12:52,020 --> 04:12:52,940
Oh, I got another elevator.

3525
04:12:54,300 --> 04:12:54,560
Oh, wait.

3526
04:12:54,580 --> 04:12:55,100
No, it's not.

3527
04:12:55,980 --> 04:12:56,400
Oh, nice.

3528
04:12:56,500 --> 04:12:56,980
Thank you.

3529
04:12:58,520 --> 04:13:00,080
Yeah, I got that.

3530
04:13:00,240 --> 04:13:00,720
Yay.

3531
04:13:01,560 --> 04:13:02,320
Streamer luck.

3532
04:13:03,640 --> 04:13:04,240
Let's go.

3533
04:13:04,360 --> 04:13:06,840
I ask and I receive because I'm a streamer.

3534
04:13:08,480 --> 04:13:09,440
I have to go.

3535
04:13:09,580 --> 04:13:10,120
Where do I go?

3536
04:13:11,380 --> 04:13:11,860
Oh.

3537
04:13:12,600 --> 04:13:13,080

3538
04:13:14,520 --> 04:13:17,040
All right, guys, we go up, left, or down?

3539
04:13:19,340 --> 04:13:21,400
I'll go down, because I'm here anyway.

3540
04:13:21,620 --> 04:13:22,300
Party time.

3541
04:13:24,240 --> 04:13:24,800
Oh, my God.

3542
04:13:24,920 --> 04:13:25,920

Yes to all of it.

3548
04:13:35,520 --> 04:13:36,900
I don't like these guys.

3549
04:13:40,940 --> 04:13:41,600
Oh, shit!

3550
04:13:42,040 --> 04:13:42,560
Oh, my God.

3551
04:13:42,600 --> 04:13:43,580

They even took the NPC's job.

3555
04:14:23,460 --> 04:14:24,140
Oh, no.

3556
04:14:24,840 --> 04:14:26,520
Not a boss, bro.

3558
04:14:29,400 --> 04:14:30,620
Oh, no.

3570
04:16:07,680 --> 04:16:09,140
I've never learned.

3571
04:16:09,860 --> 04:16:10,700
I just...

3572
04:16:10,700 --> 04:16:12,300
I just never learned.

3573
04:16:15,280 --> 04:16:17,260
I don't know what to tell you.

3574
04:16:21,560 --> 04:16:24,020
Oh my god, I hate this.

3575
04:16:29,120 --> 04:16:29,900

Get out of here.

3578
04:16:34,360 --> 04:16:34,960
Get out of here.

3579
04:16:36,480 --> 04:16:37,180
Oh.

3580
04:16:42,890 --> 04:16:43,390
There's a!

3581
04:16:43,390 --> 04:16:44,390
There's a high ground!

3582
04:16:48,450 --> 04:16:49,550
Oh my god.

3583
04:16:50,170 --> 04:16:50,890
Oh my god.

3584
04:16:51,190 --> 04:16:51,510
Why?

3585
04:16:51,650 --> 04:16:52,910
Why did they have to use AI?

3586
04:16:53,590 --> 04:16:55,370
Why did they have to use AI?

3587
04:17:02,350 --> 04:17:03,170
There we go.

3588
04:17:04,670 --> 04:17:05,470
Oh there's more.

3589
04:17:06,710 --> 04:17:07,270
Oh no.

3590
04:17:09,730 --> 04:17:10,190
No!

3591
04:17:16,480 --> 04:17:18,480
I can't believe it.

3592
04:17:20,180 --> 04:17:20,820
It's over.

3593
04:17:22,560 --> 04:17:23,020
It's over.

3594
04:17:23,180 --> 04:17:25,020
The AI is taking over the world.

3595
04:17:26,800 --> 04:17:28,720
I got chat GPT'd.

3596
04:17:34,050 --> 04:17:35,250
I knew it.

3597
04:17:36,150 --> 04:17:38,070
I knew we should have beat up the...

3598
04:17:38,070 --> 04:17:41,090
I knew we should have stopped the Boston Dynamic Fudge.

3599
04:17:42,050 --> 04:17:45,170
I knew when they were pushing them they should never have stopped.

3600
04:17:45,450 --> 04:17:46,570
I knew.

3601
04:17:50,070 --> 04:17:52,530
Never stop pushing those bots.

3602
04:17:55,670 --> 04:17:56,890
Why did we fund Boston?

3603
04:17:59,570 --> 04:18:02,350
We should have taken Boston's funding.

3604
04:18:04,810 --> 04:18:06,610
I never learned.

3605
04:18:07,630 --> 04:18:09,150
I never learned.

3606
04:18:09,970 --> 04:18:11,170
Oh my god.

3607
04:18:11,770 --> 04:18:14,690
I don't know.

3608
04:18:15,330 --> 04:18:17,950
I don't know why I can't learn.

3609
04:18:18,410 --> 04:18:19,730
I don't know why.

3610
04:18:21,070 --> 04:18:23,250
I always assume I'm safe.

3611
04:18:25,590 --> 04:18:28,350
I don't know why I keep thinking I'll be safe.

3612
04:18:32,270 --> 04:18:33,430
I hate this guy.

3613
04:18:33,730 --> 04:18:36,270
I hate him so much.

3614
04:18:39,130 --> 04:18:39,970
Are you serious?

3615
04:18:40,430 --> 04:18:42,210
Oh, oh my god.

3616
04:18:50,430 --> 04:18:52,170
Okay, go ahead.

3617
04:19:00,830 --> 04:19:01,710
Oh god.

3618
04:19:03,310 --> 04:19:04,390
Okay, that's fine.

3619
04:19:05,190 --> 04:19:05,990
There's more!

3620
04:19:06,490 --> 04:19:06,850
Oh god.

3621
04:19:07,190 --> 04:19:07,670
Okay, I looked.

3622
04:19:10,290 --> 04:19:11,590
I looked this time.

3623
04:19:15,630 --> 04:19:15,910
Okay.

3624
04:19:17,350 --> 04:19:18,790
Oh my god, how many?

3625
04:19:19,410 --> 04:19:19,890
How many?

3626
04:19:20,130 --> 04:19:20,690
How many?

3627
04:19:22,270 --> 04:19:22,570
Okay.

3628
04:19:23,470 --> 04:19:24,050
When?

3629
04:19:35,050 --> 04:19:35,950
There you go.

3630
04:19:37,050 --> 04:19:37,850
I got it.

3631
04:19:39,490 --> 04:19:40,770
Oh god, I did it.

3632
04:19:41,450 --> 04:19:47,070
all i got was a fucking lever that was my reward

3633
04:19:50,110 --> 04:20:09,790

3634
04:20:14,240 --> 04:20:14,920
All right.

3635
04:20:17,500 --> 04:20:19,500
I can't- oh, I must need double jump for that.

3636
04:20:19,740 --> 04:20:21,640
I assume we can get double jump later.

3637
04:20:25,280 --> 04:20:27,360
Oh, open door up left?

3638
04:20:28,000 --> 04:20:29,000
How do I get that?

3639
04:20:31,400 --> 04:20:33,020
Oh, I missed a switch?

3640
04:20:35,360 --> 04:20:36,500
Where's the switch?

3641
04:20:39,480 --> 04:20:41,160
I actually missed one, something?

3642
04:20:41,440 --> 04:20:42,260
Oh, there it is.

3643
04:20:44,300 --> 04:20:46,080
I realized there was a butt in here.

3644
04:20:48,560 --> 04:20:49,940
Okay, I got a little shortcut.

3645
04:20:51,840 --> 04:20:52,200
Alright.

3646
04:20:53,520 --> 04:20:54,560
As we go down.

3647
04:20:55,480 --> 04:20:56,180
Oh, shit!

3648
04:20:56,740 --> 04:20:57,280
Oh, goodbye.

3649
04:20:57,880 --> 04:20:58,500
Oh, my god.

3650
04:20:58,600 --> 04:20:58,780
Okay.

3651
04:20:59,240 --> 04:20:59,640
Let's heal.

3652
04:21:02,300 --> 04:21:03,700
Before we rob him.

3653
04:21:04,380 --> 04:21:04,720
Okay.

3654
04:21:05,040 --> 04:21:05,300
Nice.

3655
04:21:07,640 --> 04:21:09,140
I haven't gotten down yet.

3656
04:21:14,260 --> 04:21:16,220
Any else down here?

3657
04:21:20,410 --> 04:21:20,650
Okay.

3658
04:21:21,970 --> 04:21:23,430
We're in the great dining hall.

3659
04:21:26,610 --> 04:21:28,470
Alright, there's the...

3660
04:21:28,470 --> 04:21:29,510
Oh, hey, what's this?

3661
04:21:30,610 --> 04:21:30,830
Hello.

3662
04:21:32,190 --> 04:21:34,210
I require my...

3663
04:21:34,210 --> 04:21:35,850
I require my servant.

3664
04:21:36,950 --> 04:21:38,350
What an awful chat, Clyde.

3665
04:21:38,470 --> 04:21:40,670
And we kindly conduct yourself a little more carefully.

3666
04:21:41,330 --> 04:21:43,710
And why are you adoring such an awful living red?

3667
04:21:44,170 --> 04:21:45,150
By my oath.

3668
04:21:45,430 --> 04:21:48,890
Those above must make a sport of sending me the most wretched servant.

3669
04:21:49,070 --> 04:21:49,550
Hello?

3670
04:21:50,150 --> 04:21:51,270
I am royalty.

3671
04:21:52,130 --> 04:21:53,590
I am literally a princess.

3672
04:21:54,430 --> 04:21:54,910
Benefract.

3673
04:21:55,450 --> 04:21:56,630
I am no servant, sir.

3674
04:21:57,170 --> 04:21:58,270
Rather, a guest of sorts.

3675
04:21:58,630 --> 04:21:59,510
Invited by the Citadel.

3676
04:21:59,910 --> 04:22:02,190
Tell me, is this pile of oil on display your own?

3677
04:22:04,090 --> 04:22:07,290
Nothing here is my own, your impregnant young might.

3678
04:22:07,710 --> 04:22:12,290
This sacred hall and all the food contained within belong to my most exalted master.

3679
04:22:12,850 --> 04:22:19,610
The great gore man, the finest connoisseur, who has ever lived, the one whose taste transcends the ages.

3680
04:22:20,450 --> 04:22:27,830
None are left now who venerate them, as they deserve, save for the lonely, loyal, bug who stand before you.

3681
04:22:30,270 --> 04:22:34,270
The oil is merely a small savor to whet their appetite for the grand meal to come.

3682
04:22:34,750 --> 04:22:39,130
A spectacular far-loom-spanning dish I have been planning for an age.

3683
04:22:39,590 --> 04:22:47,910
But last, those above seem to have forsaken my poor master, can never hold together their necessary ingredients.

3684
04:22:48,310 --> 04:22:49,370
Blaster indolence.

3685
04:22:50,390 --> 04:22:53,550
Still, you terror here, Bug who calls yourself a guest.

3686
04:22:53,990 --> 04:22:57,590
If your idol calls me work, put them in the service for exalted great Gormad.

3687
04:22:58,010 --> 04:23:03,710
I must remain by my master, so you will need to leave the citadel and gather the ingredients for their meal in my stead.

3688
04:23:04,390 --> 04:23:04,930
What is this?

3689
04:23:05,010 --> 04:23:06,210
Is this a good wish to get?

3690
04:23:07,150 --> 04:23:07,570
To do?

3691
04:23:10,270 --> 04:23:13,670
I could check down any ingredient you desire for a price.

3692
04:23:14,150 --> 04:23:16,790
The oil you keep here, Maybe it's some use to me.

3693
04:23:20,630 --> 04:23:21,850
It's long and hard.

3694
04:23:22,690 --> 04:23:25,890
Promise it as a reward, and your master shall have his meal.

3695
04:23:27,570 --> 04:23:31,970
Such a squalid bargain ill befits a lone holy servant.

3696
04:23:32,410 --> 04:23:33,010
But so be it.

3697
04:23:33,290 --> 04:23:36,410
Fetch meat and greeners, and you shall have that pale condiment for yourself.

3698
04:23:36,590 --> 04:23:37,710
All right, what is this quest?

3699
04:23:38,890 --> 04:23:42,850
Mossberry stew, vintage nectar, couriers, rasher.

3700
04:23:43,190 --> 04:23:44,090
Oh my god.

3701
04:23:44,430 --> 04:23:45,470
Oh my god.

3702
04:23:45,530 --> 04:23:46,770
Am I making some fucking...

3703
04:23:46,890 --> 04:23:51,190
Mission and the Star meal, like, in this, in this area?

3704
04:23:53,890 --> 04:23:55,950
I need double jump first, okay.

3705
04:23:56,690 --> 04:23:58,530
All right, let's figure out how to get double jump.

3706
04:24:01,710 --> 04:24:02,870
What is this?

3707
04:24:04,050 --> 04:24:05,470
I don't even know where I am.

3708
04:24:10,790 --> 04:24:11,690
What's this?

3709
04:24:13,830 --> 04:24:15,110
Is there anything here?

3710
04:24:16,950 --> 04:24:17,990
Is that a secret?

3711
04:24:19,870 --> 04:24:20,450
Oh, no.

3712
04:24:20,470 --> 04:24:21,550
There's supposed to be a secret here.

3713
04:24:24,110 --> 04:24:24,510
Hello?

3714
04:24:25,670 --> 04:24:26,690
What is here?

3715
04:24:29,770 --> 04:24:30,550
Oh, wait.

3716
04:24:31,190 --> 04:24:32,190
Oh, it's nice silk eater.

3717
04:24:32,470 --> 04:24:32,690
Okay.

3718
04:24:34,070 --> 04:24:35,670
I felt like there was a secret here.

3719
04:24:38,070 --> 04:24:40,190
I need something before getting the double jump.

3720
04:24:40,290 --> 04:24:40,790
What do I need?

3721
04:24:41,890 --> 04:24:43,530
I need a needle grab first.

3722
04:24:43,730 --> 04:24:44,050
Okay.

3723
04:24:44,430 --> 04:24:46,390
All right, now we gotta figure out how to get the needle grab.

3724
04:24:54,590 --> 04:24:55,030
Hey.

3725
04:24:55,450 --> 04:24:55,550
Hey.

3726
04:24:56,710 --> 04:24:57,890
Oh my god.

3727
04:24:58,130 --> 04:24:58,810
Oh, it's time.

3728
04:24:58,970 --> 04:25:00,210
It's fucking time.

3729
04:25:02,770 --> 04:25:04,490
A fucking course it is.

3730
04:25:07,190 --> 04:25:08,450
Okay, it doesn't even matter.

3731
04:25:08,610 --> 04:25:09,690
I have fucking wall jump.

3732
04:25:11,210 --> 04:25:12,250
What's the point?

3733
04:25:12,530 --> 04:25:13,450
Oh wait, that's the point.

3734
04:25:18,790 --> 04:25:20,810
Like, I can wall jump.

3735
04:25:26,530 --> 04:25:28,190
Okay, I'm just gonna... Wait.

3736
04:25:29,190 --> 04:25:30,010
Are you serious?

3737
04:25:30,310 --> 04:25:30,870
Stupid bell.

3738
04:25:33,190 --> 04:25:34,730
Alright, I got it.

3739
04:25:40,100 --> 04:25:40,940
Fuck this.

3740
04:25:44,060 --> 04:25:44,620
Hit.

3741
04:25:47,880 --> 04:25:48,920
Alright, nice.

3742
04:25:51,180 --> 04:25:53,380
Okay, I need to kill you for silk.

3743
04:25:54,520 --> 04:25:56,100
Alright, uh...

3744
04:25:56,100 --> 04:25:57,300
Wait, was there something over here?

3745
04:25:57,820 --> 04:25:58,660
Oh yeah, there it is.

3746
04:25:59,940 --> 04:26:01,080
What's over here?

3747
04:26:02,280 --> 04:26:03,040
There it is.

3748
04:26:03,160 --> 04:26:03,420
Oh.

3749
04:26:04,900 --> 04:26:06,500
Oh, it's the...

3750
04:26:06,500 --> 04:26:06,760
Okay.

3751
04:26:08,200 --> 04:26:08,960
It's a start cut.

3752
04:26:12,300 --> 04:26:12,800
Alright.

3753
04:26:14,340 --> 04:26:15,720
We go this way.

3754
04:26:18,480 --> 04:26:19,640
Alright, let's kill it.

3755
04:26:19,800 --> 04:26:20,180
Oh, wait.

3756
04:26:20,260 --> 04:26:21,180
There's another guy?

3757
04:26:21,560 --> 04:26:21,940
Whoa!

3758
04:26:22,160 --> 04:26:22,520
What is he doing?

3759
04:26:22,700 --> 04:26:23,800
Wait, he's eating myself!

3760
04:26:24,060 --> 04:26:25,040
He's eating myself!

3761
04:26:25,380 --> 04:26:26,360
Hey, no handouts!

3762
04:26:29,430 --> 04:26:30,870
No handouts here!

3763
04:26:31,930 --> 04:26:34,030
I earned this some fair and square!

3764
04:26:35,270 --> 04:26:35,790
Okay.

3765
04:26:39,810 --> 04:26:41,970
Okay, let's find this first.

3766
04:26:43,830 --> 04:26:44,430
Alright.

3767
04:26:46,490 --> 04:26:46,930
Get him!

3768
04:26:47,070 --> 04:26:48,190
Someone called a police!

3769
04:26:49,970 --> 04:26:51,090
Wait, I wonder...

3770
04:26:51,090 --> 04:26:53,070
Wait, can I...

3771
04:26:53,070 --> 04:26:53,470
Oh.

3772
04:26:54,270 --> 04:26:55,330
Wait, do I have Pogo?

3773
04:26:55,890 --> 04:26:57,330
I can't do that.

3774
04:27:05,910 --> 04:27:06,650
If only...

3775
04:27:06,650 --> 04:27:09,390
If only I had Pogo, that would look so cool.

3776
04:27:12,430 --> 04:27:14,550
What I wanted to be, I was gonna say.

3779
04:28:23,110 --> 04:28:24,410
Oh, and good luck to you, sir, bud.

3780
04:28:24,730 --> 04:28:29,450
It is hard to meet another of sound, mild, and a fortune enough to fight back against many haunted husks.

3781
04:28:30,130 --> 04:28:30,810
Oh, oh my god.

3782
04:28:31,170 --> 04:28:31,710
Never ending.

3783
04:28:32,150 --> 04:28:34,090
These natural opponents.

3784
04:28:34,490 --> 04:28:43,310
The Citadel seems as, it seems its twisted sorts, and honor decrees we must fight on until we read the heart of its, rend its heart of its decay.

3785
04:28:44,110 --> 04:28:45,110
Who are you?

3786
04:28:45,730 --> 04:28:47,110
You just came out of nowhere.

3787
04:28:51,750 --> 04:28:52,770
Yeah, never, I...

3788
04:28:52,970 --> 04:28:54,950
Is he like, oh, he's the guy that helps me for more?

3789
04:28:55,050 --> 04:28:56,710
Oh, yeah, I never encountered him.

3790
04:28:57,410 --> 04:28:59,010
Leave us to our noble hunt, sister.

3791
04:28:59,410 --> 04:29:03,450
The city of Twisted Bug still infect these gilded hauls.

3792
04:29:03,970 --> 04:29:07,350
Many are their numbers, but we shall see their life threats severed.

3793
04:29:08,110 --> 04:29:08,650
Alright, cool.

3794
04:29:10,570 --> 04:29:12,250
Is he like, what's his name?

3795
04:29:13,210 --> 04:29:13,270
Um.

3796
04:29:15,170 --> 04:29:16,970
The guy you told me the...

3797
04:29:17,710 --> 04:29:18,650
What was his name?

3798
04:29:18,730 --> 04:29:22,110
The Great and Powerful Bug in Hollow Knight?

3799
04:29:22,970 --> 04:29:23,290
him?

3800
04:29:25,070 --> 04:29:25,890
He is cool.

3801
04:29:26,110 --> 04:29:26,810
The cooler Zote?

3802
04:29:26,950 --> 04:29:27,670
Yeah, is he Zote?

3803
04:29:27,970 --> 04:29:29,590
Is he the Zote of Silk Song?

3804
04:29:31,310 --> 04:29:32,950
Oh my god, I didn't realize my HP.

3805
04:29:35,970 --> 04:29:38,350
But is he like the Zote of Silk Song?

3806
04:29:41,530 --> 04:29:43,610
No, Zote is cooler.

3807
04:29:45,370 --> 04:29:46,270
Oh, shit!

3808
04:29:47,030 --> 04:29:50,210
Oh my god, that scared me.

3809
04:29:57,540 --> 04:29:59,460
Oh, Oh nice, it was just his money!

3810
04:30:05,340 --> 04:30:08,020
Okay, I want to grab some silk.

3811
04:30:10,580 --> 04:30:11,260
Nice.

3812
04:30:12,020 --> 04:30:12,480
When?

3813
04:30:18,170 --> 04:30:18,850
Alright.

3814
04:30:19,150 --> 04:30:19,830
Yay, money!

3815
04:30:20,890 --> 04:30:22,090
Okay, down I'll go.

3816
04:30:22,950 --> 04:30:23,210
Whee!

3817
04:30:24,110 --> 04:30:25,110
Oh shit!

3818
04:30:26,530 --> 04:30:27,530
What was he doing?

3819
04:30:30,710 --> 04:30:32,450
Okay, I'll keep going down.

3820
04:30:36,710 --> 04:30:37,590
This way.

3821
04:30:39,390 --> 04:30:40,110
Oh, shit.

3822
04:30:41,430 --> 04:30:42,210
Oh, my god.

3823
04:30:42,890 --> 04:30:43,410
There, it's fine.

3824
04:30:44,310 --> 04:30:44,650
We're fine.

3825
04:30:45,890 --> 04:30:45,970
Yay!

3826
04:30:46,670 --> 04:30:47,550
See, I told you we're fine.

3827
04:30:48,430 --> 04:30:49,710
Oh, it's a fine pit.

3828
04:30:49,910 --> 04:30:50,910
I forgot about that quest.

3829
04:30:51,870 --> 04:30:54,310
They're like, remember to grab the fine pit from the guys.

3830
04:30:54,630 --> 04:30:56,010
Like, don't worry, I remember.

3831
04:30:58,310 --> 04:30:59,870
She did not remember.

3832
04:31:05,770 --> 04:31:06,290
Oh, wait.

3833
04:31:06,290 --> 04:31:06,890
That's the elevator.

3834
04:31:08,810 --> 04:31:10,690
Don't worry, I'll definitely do your quest.

3835
04:31:10,810 --> 04:31:11,850
Oh, what's that?

3836
04:31:12,130 --> 04:31:13,190
I'm not going there.

3837
04:31:22,700 --> 04:31:23,800
What's over here?

3838
04:31:25,800 --> 04:31:26,780
Oh, is there anything else?

3839
04:31:26,880 --> 04:31:27,520
Oh, wait, there is.

3840
04:31:28,760 --> 04:31:31,000
Okay, I just want to farm some silk off of her.

3841
04:31:31,360 --> 04:31:31,680
When?

3842
04:31:34,500 --> 04:31:37,020
Oh, my God, it's the...

3843
04:31:37,020 --> 04:31:40,460
Chad Garmon versus the Virgin Zone.

3844
04:31:41,140 --> 04:31:42,580
Thank you for the super chat.

3845
04:31:42,740 --> 04:31:43,180
Thank you.

3846
04:31:43,180 --> 04:31:44,080

What's this?

3851
04:32:25,020 --> 04:32:25,800
Oh, it's a pattern?

3852
04:32:26,500 --> 04:32:26,920
Bum.

3853
04:32:27,480 --> 04:32:29,140
Bum, bum, bum.

Bum, bum, bum.

3857
04:32:39,340 --> 04:32:39,500
Bum.

3858
04:32:39,500 --> 04:32:39,700
Bum.

3859
04:32:40,720 --> 04:32:41,520
Oh, it's easy.

3860
04:32:42,720 --> 04:32:43,000
No.

3861
04:32:45,380 --> 04:32:46,160
Okay.

3862
04:32:47,120 --> 04:32:47,900
Um.

3863
04:32:48,580 --> 04:32:53,080
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

3864
04:32:54,060 --> 04:32:54,860
Last one.

3865
04:32:55,880 --> 04:32:56,020
Yay!

3866
04:32:57,020 --> 04:32:58,040
See, guys?

3867
04:32:58,620 --> 04:33:00,860
I don't have short attention span.

3868
04:33:01,960 --> 04:33:02,760
Look at that.

3869
04:33:02,880 --> 04:33:04,020
I can remember.

3870
04:33:05,900 --> 04:33:07,240
I'm so fucking smart.

3871
04:33:07,900 --> 04:33:09,480
I've got a Cogheart piece.

3872
04:33:09,820 --> 04:33:10,500
What the fuck is that?

3873
04:33:11,400 --> 04:33:13,420
I'm so good at this game, guys.

3874
04:33:13,520 --> 04:33:14,120
Look at that.

3875
04:33:15,840 --> 04:33:17,180
I can remember.

3876
04:33:19,340 --> 04:33:21,680
See, this is my proof that I don't have ADHD.

3877
04:33:24,100 --> 04:33:27,000
Oh, it's him.

3878
04:33:27,540 --> 04:33:28,980
It's a BBB guy.

3879
04:33:35,430 --> 04:33:40,970
If you can't acknowledge that Horn is 10 out of 10, I know what you are.

3880
04:33:43,870 --> 04:33:44,670
Well, well, well.

3881
04:33:44,890 --> 04:33:48,290
See what happens to nasty bully bugs when they come after poor old Grindel?

3882
04:33:48,690 --> 04:33:50,930
That's a well-deserved end, we reckon.

3883
04:33:53,070 --> 04:33:55,710
Citadel was nice and quiet and bursting with goodies.

3884
04:33:56,090 --> 04:33:56,910
So what happened, eh?

3885
04:33:57,230 --> 04:34:00,090
Why, it's crowding with bullies and buzzy bodies.

3886
04:34:01,190 --> 04:34:04,310
The creature that haunts this place is stirring little thief.

3887
04:34:04,770 --> 04:34:06,650
The silo's cast now roam the halls.

3888
04:34:07,030 --> 04:34:09,330
You'll do well to leave soon if you mean to survive.

3889
04:34:09,570 --> 04:34:10,030
Fall again.

3890
04:34:10,430 --> 04:34:10,990
When what?

3891
04:34:11,270 --> 04:34:12,350
You being merciful?

3892
04:34:12,850 --> 04:34:14,830
We're staying here till we're done pilfering.

3893
04:34:15,090 --> 04:34:17,170
You should be the one leaving if you're so afraid.

3894
04:34:19,610 --> 04:34:22,790
Boy, you've been creeping around this dusty old place for a while, then, sir.

3895
04:34:22,970 --> 04:34:25,170
You might be carrying a lot of goodies with you.

3896
04:34:25,510 --> 04:34:27,530
Let poor little snitchfile have a quick look.

3897
04:34:27,890 --> 04:34:28,510
Hey, hey, hey.

3898
04:34:28,510 --> 04:34:29,130
No touching.

3899
04:34:29,390 --> 04:34:30,230
Get out.

3900
04:34:31,430 --> 04:34:31,970
Here we come.

3901
04:34:32,810 --> 04:34:33,410
Oh, man.

3902
04:34:33,770 --> 04:34:34,790
Ew, he likes it.

3903
04:34:34,990 --> 04:34:37,530
Well, around here and keep your nasty junk to yourself, then.

3904
04:34:40,150 --> 04:34:40,590
Hey.

3905
04:34:40,830 --> 04:34:42,130
Swiper, no swiping.

3906
04:34:44,750 --> 04:34:45,190
Slap.

3907
04:34:47,490 --> 04:34:48,730
Hey, swiper, no.

3908
04:34:48,850 --> 04:34:49,290
Swiping.

3909
04:34:53,650 --> 04:34:54,630
All right, this way.

3910
04:34:55,010 --> 04:34:58,570
He's just like me for real for real.

3911
04:34:58,690 --> 04:34:59,690
Is there anything here?

3912
04:35:00,510 --> 04:35:00,510
No

3913
04:35:05,730 --> 04:35:09,970
Might as well just full heal for now just in case.

3914
04:35:10,710 --> 04:35:13,350
Oh Okay, no, it's not okay.

3915
04:35:13,630 --> 04:35:14,730
It's it's okay.

3916
04:35:14,970 --> 04:35:15,130
Thank God.

3917
04:35:15,370 --> 04:35:29,490
Okay I thought I was gonna assume it was another bot and every time it's a square I assume the worst I just assume all the square space is is hell Where do I go?

3918
04:35:36,970 --> 04:35:38,430
I actually don't know where to go, actually.

3919
04:35:40,750 --> 04:35:42,170
Oh my god, stupid belt.

3920
04:35:42,850 --> 04:35:44,530
Oh my god, I'm timing it, Ron.

3921
04:35:48,950 --> 04:35:49,690
I give up.

3922
04:35:49,770 --> 04:35:50,490
You can have it.

3923
04:35:50,670 --> 04:35:51,130
I don't care.

3924
04:35:51,750 --> 04:35:53,090
I'll go a different way.

3925
04:35:53,770 --> 04:35:54,590
You can have it.

3926
04:35:56,110 --> 04:35:57,570
Oh my god, of course.

3927
04:35:58,330 --> 04:36:00,110
Oh, and then she comes back down.

3928
04:36:06,870 --> 04:36:08,650
Okay, I'll just be up this guy.

3929
04:36:12,450 --> 04:36:13,810
I don't know where to go.

3930
04:36:14,050 --> 04:36:14,830
I'm so lost.

3931
04:36:19,130 --> 04:36:19,790
Wait, isn't that...

3932
04:36:19,790 --> 04:36:20,650
Oh, it's not here.

3933
04:36:22,390 --> 04:36:23,570
Go to that bottom, right?

3934
04:36:27,610 --> 04:36:29,230
Oh, I'll go this way.

3935
04:36:31,830 --> 04:36:33,890
I already went that area, though.

3936
04:36:34,530 --> 04:36:35,310
Where do I go?

3937
04:36:35,630 --> 04:36:36,670
Oh, there's bottom, right.

3938
04:36:38,430 --> 04:36:40,530
Go to the elevator with the key.

3939
04:36:40,930 --> 04:36:41,470
Oh, okay.

3940
04:36:43,630 --> 04:36:45,270
I don't remember.

3941
04:36:46,750 --> 04:36:48,450
I don't remember.

3942
04:36:49,730 --> 04:36:51,110
Where is that?

3943
04:36:52,170 --> 04:36:53,430
Gone gone.

3944
04:36:56,570 --> 04:36:56,590
Gone.

3945
04:37:00,510 --> 04:37:01,830
Okay, bottom of this room.

3946
04:37:02,150 --> 04:37:02,210
Okay.

3947
04:37:08,170 --> 04:37:10,650
Oh my, get away from me.

3948
04:37:12,070 --> 04:37:12,370
Yeah?

3949
04:37:13,810 --> 04:37:17,400
Is it here?

3950
04:37:17,740 --> 04:37:18,600
Oh, I don't have a map.

3951
04:37:18,620 --> 04:37:19,000
for this.

3952
04:37:19,240 --> 04:37:19,820
Oh, wait, it's here.

3953
04:37:21,820 --> 04:37:22,000
Yay!

3954
04:37:22,980 --> 04:37:23,420
Yay!

3955
04:37:26,460 --> 04:37:27,660
What's over here, though?

3956
04:37:28,720 --> 04:37:29,160
Chair!

3957
04:37:29,640 --> 04:37:30,860
Man, thank you for the raise.

3958
04:37:30,980 --> 04:37:31,700
Thank you!

3959
04:37:31,700 --> 04:37:31,980
Thank you!

3960
04:37:32,260 --> 04:37:33,480
Oh, we have a great stream.

3961
04:37:36,680 --> 04:37:37,560
Okay, uh...

3962
04:37:38,520 --> 04:37:39,780
What do I have?

3963
04:37:40,280 --> 04:37:40,660
Oh, my God.

3964
04:37:40,740 --> 04:37:41,220
I only have two.

3965
04:37:41,400 --> 04:37:43,560
How many pins do I need to get from this wish?

3966
04:37:44,980 --> 04:37:45,880
Jesus, 10.

3967
04:37:45,960 --> 04:37:48,060
Okay, uh...

3968
04:37:50,360 --> 04:37:52,340
Oh, it's fine.

3969
04:37:54,060 --> 04:37:55,160
All right, down we go.

3970
04:38:03,420 --> 04:38:04,900
We'll have go after that.

3971
04:38:06,560 --> 04:38:08,040
Many, thank you for the gift of ship.

3972
04:38:08,260 --> 04:38:09,180
Thank you, thank you.

3973
04:38:09,360 --> 04:38:09,820
Oh, chair.

3974
04:38:10,640 --> 04:38:12,380
Oh, not my chair, apparently.

3975
04:38:13,520 --> 04:38:14,340
White word.

3976
04:38:15,020 --> 04:38:15,680
What's this?

3977
04:38:17,320 --> 04:38:19,800
Is this like the doctor's?

3978
04:38:20,640 --> 04:38:23,140
An apple of the day keeps the doctor away.

3979
04:38:30,510 --> 04:38:31,890
Is this like the hospital?

3980
04:38:37,000 --> 04:38:38,800
Oh my god, where am I?

3981
04:38:43,180 --> 04:38:46,380
Oh my god, not the fucking...

3982
04:38:46,380 --> 04:38:48,200
Not the bats, these are the bats.

3983
04:38:53,770 --> 04:38:55,730
Okay, we got the silk here.

3984
04:38:57,210 --> 04:38:57,830
Who's that?

3985
04:38:59,590 --> 04:39:01,150
The doctor, is that the doctor?

3986
04:39:02,230 --> 04:39:03,150
Hello doctor?

3987
04:39:04,350 --> 04:39:05,730
Oh hey, there's a baby!

3988
04:39:05,770 --> 04:39:05,990
Oh!

3989
04:39:06,290 --> 04:39:08,310
The Coral Commandment.

3990
04:39:09,330 --> 04:39:10,310
Oh, it's just a red light.

3991
04:39:11,090 --> 04:39:11,910
Oh, there's a dark...

3992
04:39:11,910 --> 04:39:12,390
Oh!

3993
04:39:12,630 --> 04:39:12,890
Oh!

3994
04:39:15,030 --> 04:39:16,810
Oh my god, what is that?

3995
04:39:17,850 --> 04:39:18,970
What the fuck?

3996
04:39:19,290 --> 04:39:20,830
Oh my god, I thought he was still alive.

3997
04:39:21,550 --> 04:39:22,930
What the fuck was that?

3998
04:39:27,590 --> 04:39:28,570
He's like...

3999
04:39:28,570 --> 04:39:30,310
He's like one with the silk.

4000
04:39:31,390 --> 04:39:33,170
Guys, you never go full silk, guys.

4001
04:39:34,910 --> 04:39:36,850
This is what happens when you go full silk.

4002
04:39:48,010 --> 04:39:49,530
Man, I wish I have a map.

4003
04:39:57,700 --> 04:39:58,160
What did I do?

4004
04:39:58,460 --> 04:39:58,660
Oh.

4005
04:40:00,000 --> 04:40:00,520
Oh.

4006
04:40:03,760 --> 04:40:05,260
Okay, I'm going to sit down.

4007
04:40:05,740 --> 04:40:06,660
I know what I did.

4008
04:40:08,260 --> 04:40:09,620
I gotta go down again.

4009
04:40:11,040 --> 04:40:12,060
I got confused.

4010
04:40:19,900 --> 04:40:23,300
Okay, I gotta do this path again.

4011
04:40:30,760 --> 04:40:31,220
Wait.

4012
04:40:32,000 --> 04:40:32,940
I never seen this one.

4013
04:40:33,940 --> 04:40:34,900
Oh, I don't have to.

4014
04:40:34,920 --> 04:40:35,520
I don't have the key.

4015
04:40:38,200 --> 04:40:39,640
I'm just Metrovanian, you know?

4016
04:40:41,440 --> 04:40:45,080
I'm just paying, I'm just making sure it's a real Metrovania.

4017
04:40:47,680 --> 04:40:47,880
Ow.

4018
04:40:48,660 --> 04:40:50,700
Oh my God, the scene does two damage?

4019
04:40:55,170 --> 04:40:56,670
I believe that's bullshit.

4020
04:41:01,230 --> 04:41:03,190
Oh my God, I hear the silk man again.

4021
04:41:03,330 --> 04:41:04,970
I hear the, I hear him.

4022
04:41:04,970 --> 04:41:06,790
He's like, oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

4023
04:41:07,290 --> 04:41:08,430
I'm not dealing with that.

4024
04:41:09,190 --> 04:41:09,190
I

4025
04:41:13,630 --> 04:41:16,630
guess I go this way then.

4026
04:41:20,550 --> 04:41:21,090
Alright, secret!

4027
04:41:25,640 --> 04:41:26,480
Wait, is that silk?

4028
04:41:26,700 --> 04:41:27,280
Oh, it is.

4029
04:41:27,960 --> 04:41:29,760
I'll grab some silk real quick.

4030
04:41:31,720 --> 04:41:32,300
Is that it?

4031
04:41:33,400 --> 04:41:35,180
Was the secret just more silk?

4032
04:41:39,180 --> 04:41:41,160
Oh, I guess it was just more silk.

4033
04:41:47,750 --> 04:41:48,930
It dropped an item?

4034
04:41:49,090 --> 04:41:49,850
I didn't see it.

4035
04:41:50,690 --> 04:41:52,250
Oh, there was a silky there?

4036
04:41:53,110 --> 04:41:54,110
I didn't see the shiny.

4037
04:41:56,730 --> 04:41:58,830
Where is it?

4038
04:42:03,270 --> 04:42:05,030
Where the fuck is it?

4039
04:42:07,090 --> 04:42:08,370
It despawns?

4040
04:42:09,850 --> 04:42:10,610
What happened?

4041
04:42:10,710 --> 04:42:12,130
Did it fucking die?

4042
04:42:14,330 --> 04:42:17,150
How the fuck did it despawn?

4043
04:42:19,990 --> 04:42:20,930
It's dead.

4044
04:42:21,090 --> 04:42:22,570
It was gonna die anyway!

4045
04:42:22,710 --> 04:42:23,670
I was gonna eat it!

4046
04:42:27,390 --> 04:42:28,690
That's so dumb.

4047
04:42:31,990 --> 04:42:34,170
It fucking, like, rot it into the ground.

4048
04:42:37,770 --> 04:42:38,790
Unity, think it was super chat.

4049
04:42:38,810 --> 04:42:40,190
Think it was time to go to work.

4050
04:42:40,410 --> 04:42:40,930
See y'all in Voss.

4051
04:42:41,110 --> 04:42:41,670
Think it was super chat.

4052
04:42:41,690 --> 04:42:43,130
Think it was time to go to work.

4053
04:42:47,870 --> 04:42:50,510
Yeah, it fucking decayed into the ground, apparently.

4054
04:42:50,850 --> 04:42:51,510
What the?

4055
04:42:52,110 --> 04:42:52,790
Oh, my God.

4056
04:42:52,970 --> 04:42:53,790
I did not mean to do that.

4057
04:42:58,430 --> 04:42:58,970
This.

4058
04:42:59,270 --> 04:43:00,660
He's gonna keep throwing this at him.

4059
04:43:03,370 --> 04:43:04,510
Get fuck up.

4060
04:43:05,050 --> 04:43:05,750
That's right.

4061
04:43:06,770 --> 04:43:07,970
Get Tani-sticked.

4062
04:43:10,150 --> 04:43:11,150
I ain't dealing with that shit.

4063
04:43:13,150 --> 04:43:14,610
Oh my god, there's more of you.

4064
04:43:15,550 --> 04:43:17,380
I didn't think there was more of you.

4065
04:43:21,590 --> 04:43:23,090
Alright, now I'm just gonna...

4066
04:43:23,630 --> 04:43:24,910
Getani-sticked.

4067
04:43:25,430 --> 04:43:25,870
What?

4068
04:43:26,690 --> 04:43:27,970
Okay, I heal.

4069
04:43:32,950 --> 04:43:33,910
What's this?

4070
04:43:36,930 --> 04:43:38,850
Oh my god, there's another one.

4071
04:43:39,350 --> 04:43:40,170
No, it's fine.

4072
04:43:40,330 --> 04:43:40,950
You can go.

4073
04:43:41,090 --> 04:43:42,530
You can just stay there.

4074
04:43:46,910 --> 04:43:48,170
Oh hey, I know.

4075
04:43:49,230 --> 04:43:50,390
Inject your ban.

4076
04:43:51,830 --> 04:43:52,310
Oh!

4077
04:43:52,870 --> 04:43:53,750
Wait, that's good!

4078
04:43:57,090 --> 04:43:58,770
Wait, but what can I get rid of?

4079
04:43:58,770 --> 04:44:00,150
That lets me heal faster.

4080
04:44:01,250 --> 04:44:01,790
Yeah.

4081
04:44:04,270 --> 04:44:09,010
Yeah, I can heal faster now, but I have to get rid of- I feel like I can get rid of my extra health.

4082
04:44:12,940 --> 04:44:13,480
Yeah.

4083
04:44:21,140 --> 04:44:23,580
Where the fuck am I?

4084
04:44:24,240 --> 04:44:25,360
Okay, now I'm here.

4085
04:44:26,460 --> 04:44:27,820
Secret room above?

4086
04:44:29,780 --> 04:44:31,440
How do I get to the secret room?

4087
04:44:41,220 --> 04:44:42,380
Oh, too late.

4088
04:44:42,940 --> 04:44:43,100
Oops.

4089
04:44:44,120 --> 04:44:44,660
Oopsie.

04:44:44,940 --> 04:44:45,060
Oopsie.

4091
04:44:48,360 --> 04:44:49,840
Yes, there's no more secret.

4092
04:44:52,060 --> 04:44:52,620
Wee.

4093
04:44:59,770 --> 04:45:01,050
What the fuck is that?

4094
04:45:01,290 --> 04:45:02,430
Why is she binded?

4095
04:45:03,290 --> 04:45:04,590
Is she a bad girl?

4096
04:45:06,750 --> 04:45:08,390
Find it for crimes.

4097
04:45:09,070 --> 04:45:10,210
What was her crime?

4098
04:45:14,640 --> 04:45:16,480
By being a baddie.

4099
04:45:18,020 --> 04:45:19,220
Lock her up.

4100
04:45:20,060 --> 04:45:21,400
She was a baddie.

4101
04:45:25,180 --> 04:45:26,400
Where am I now?

4102
04:45:27,060 --> 04:45:27,680
Why is it?

4103
04:45:28,200 --> 04:45:30,200

Bench to the left.

4106
04:45:35,540 --> 04:45:35,600
Okay.

4107
04:45:37,480 --> 04:45:37,960
What?

4108
04:45:39,600 --> 04:45:40,340
Oh, nice.

4109
04:45:40,560 --> 04:45:41,040
Bench time.

4110
04:45:42,320 --> 04:45:46,940
Okay, uh, we'll get rid of this and put that here.

4111
04:45:49,680 --> 04:45:52,020
Oh my gosh, I'm so- there's so many places to go.

4112
04:45:52,240 --> 04:45:53,220
I'll go down.

4113
04:45:54,540 --> 04:45:55,600
Oh, nice shards.

4114
04:45:56,220 --> 04:45:58,400
I'm using my tools more, so that's good.

4115
04:46:07,380 --> 04:46:07,940
Wee!

4116
04:46:09,240 --> 04:46:10,280

04:46:21,010 --> 04:46:22,110
Now I'm here.

4120
04:46:28,590 --> 04:46:29,350
Where am I?

4121
04:46:31,770 --> 04:46:33,670
Do I have to be here?

4122
04:46:33,990 --> 04:46:34,830
Wait, this place?

4123
04:46:35,610 --> 04:46:36,310
Down and right.

04:46:36,370 --> 04:46:37,570
Okay, give me a sec.

4125
04:46:38,030 --> 04:46:40,210
I saw a lot of fire and I don't like it.

4126
04:46:44,510 --> 04:46:49,250
Okay, we're gonna have to use this.

4127
04:46:50,390 --> 04:46:51,370

4128
04:46:53,910 --> 04:46:55,250

I can recover from this.

4153
04:48:15,000 --> 04:48:15,640
Are you safe?

4154

Why?

4179
04:49:22,470 --> 04:49:26,170
It's like a window cleaner just standing at the edge.

Everything's still okay.

4211
04:51:01,630 --> 04:51:02,650
See, it's still okay, guys.

4212
04:51:02,850 --> 04:51:03,470
It's still okay.

4213
04:51:06,750 --> 04:51:07,770
Dude, can you see that again?

4214
04:51:07,970 --> 04:51:09,790
I just want to be sure if it's still okay.

4215
04:51:14,710 --> 04:51:16,270
It's still water again, dude.

4216
04:51:16,750 --> 04:51:17,950
Guys, it's still okay.

4217
04:51:19,990 --> 04:51:21,130
I'm so sad.

4218
04:51:21,350 --> 04:51:22,930
I'm so sad.

4219
04:51:25,970 --> 04:51:27,330
Oh my god.

4220
04:51:27,910 --> 04:51:30,030
All right, when I'm one HP, I'll eat the silk.

4221
04:51:30,670 --> 04:51:31,110
I'm...

4222
04:51:40,790 --> 04:51:42,110
It's okay, we can make it.

4223
04:51:42,530 --> 04:51:43,790
We can still make it.

4224
04:51:44,850 --> 04:51:45,590
Wait, is this way?

4225
04:51:45,670 --> 04:51:46,190
Is this way?

4226
04:51:52,370 --> 04:51:54,570
Oh my god, I forgot about him.

4227
04:51:55,650 --> 04:51:56,130
It's okay.

4228
04:51:58,270 --> 04:52:30,920
maybe he'll go into the lava come on come on go oh my god there's literally oh my god there's an invisible wall there oh my god oh my god oh my god it's time it's time i have to eat it i have to eat it okay i i can't i can't i can't risk it i couldn't risk It was...

4229
04:52:30,920 --> 04:52:31,620
It was...

4230
04:52:31,620 --> 04:52:32,740
It was not...

4231
04:52:35,040 --> 04:52:36,700
Oh my god.

4232
04:52:36,880 --> 04:52:37,380
Thank god.

4233
04:52:37,840 --> 04:52:40,880
I did not trust myself.

4234
04:52:41,900 --> 04:52:42,800
The cards were...

4235
04:52:42,800 --> 04:52:45,260
It was not the heart of the cards today.

4236
04:52:45,720 --> 04:52:47,180
It was not in my favor.

4237
04:52:47,340 --> 04:52:49,200
The cards were not in my favor.

4238
04:52:52,760 --> 04:52:54,540
Oh my god.

4239
04:52:54,680 --> 04:52:55,340
Please sir.

4240
04:52:55,620 --> 04:52:58,100
I've been through so much.

4241
04:53:00,140 --> 04:53:04,000
Oh, just like I was, I didn't want to deal with it.

4242
04:53:04,560 --> 04:53:06,640
Oh, it was all for craft metal.

4243
04:53:07,780 --> 04:53:09,640
All for craft metal.

4244
04:53:10,360 --> 04:53:11,380
Oh, fuck.

4245
04:53:13,780 --> 04:53:14,940
My silk.

4246
04:53:16,300 --> 04:53:18,280
My beautiful silk.

4247
04:53:22,000 --> 04:53:22,580
Okay.

4248
04:53:29,370 --> 04:53:32,190
All right, as long as that lava doesn't hit me, we should be fine.

4249
04:53:34,010 --> 04:53:35,810
Lock the fire.

4250
04:53:36,230 --> 04:53:37,450
It's not my fault.

4251
04:53:37,670 --> 04:53:38,530
It's the fire.

4252
04:53:40,650 --> 04:53:42,650
It's the fire, chat.

4253
04:53:43,810 --> 04:53:45,490
There's just something about it.

4254
04:53:46,790 --> 04:53:48,650
Something about the fire.

4255
04:53:50,570 --> 04:53:51,890
I can't think.

4256
04:53:52,510 --> 04:53:54,690
It's like a fly when it sees the light.

4257
04:53:55,650 --> 04:53:57,090
All I want to do.

4258
04:53:57,930 --> 04:53:59,510
All I want to do is just go.

4259
04:53:59,630 --> 04:54:02,470
I'm just attracted by the light of the fire.

4260
04:54:03,850 --> 04:54:16,110
distant land we who remain have waited long find our strength to yours reclaim the future of our haunted kingdom i'm

4261
04:54:20,550 --> 04:54:47,450
like um yeah i'm like a moth attracted to the flame oh i got it i got the needle thread lt and launch silk will be expended strike enemies to replenish silk okay okay nice okay how do i use it yeah i'm just hanging oh oh guess i don't need it

4263
04:55:16,310 --> 04:55:16,590
Oh!

4264
04:55:20,770 --> 04:55:21,330
Wee!

4265
04:55:21,370 --> 04:55:22,810
I didn't realize!

4266
04:55:23,770 --> 04:55:24,330
Oops.

4267
04:55:25,690 --> 04:55:26,890
I'm just being a little silly.

4268
04:55:29,110 --> 04:55:31,770
I didn't realize, um...

4269
04:55:32,710 --> 04:55:34,850
You can use it without the needle.

4270
04:55:35,390 --> 04:55:36,590
I thought it was like...

4271
04:55:36,970 --> 04:55:39,210
I thought I need to use it for the needle.

4272
04:55:41,910 --> 04:55:43,850
Okay, that makes more sense, guys.

4273
04:55:44,990 --> 04:55:46,770
Supri- oh my god.

4274
04:55:49,250 --> 04:55:51,150
Oh my god, I ran out of silk.

4275
04:55:52,290 --> 04:55:52,530
Okay.

4276
04:55:55,970 --> 04:55:56,530
Okay.

4277
04:55:57,810 --> 04:55:59,990
I'm just hanging there.

4278
04:56:05,650 --> 04:56:06,070
Alright.

4279
04:56:07,290 --> 04:56:07,890
What's this for?

4280
04:56:12,100 --> 04:56:12,660
What?

4281
04:56:12,720 --> 04:56:14,060
Why would there be a hangar here?

4282
04:56:16,280 --> 04:56:17,260
Oh, okay.

4283
04:56:18,200 --> 04:56:18,600
Nice.

4284
04:56:18,760 --> 04:56:19,360
Okay, that makes sense.

4285
04:56:19,420 --> 04:56:19,860
I was like, what?

4286
04:56:21,060 --> 04:56:22,420
All right, now let there be...

4287
04:56:22,420 --> 04:56:23,460
Oh, my God.

4288
04:56:23,880 --> 04:56:24,400
Oh, my...

4289
04:56:24,400 --> 04:56:24,720
Of course.

4290
04:56:26,400 --> 04:56:27,140
Okay, of course.

4291
04:56:28,060 --> 04:56:30,200
I was like, why would there be a light there?

4292
04:56:30,640 --> 04:56:32,600
Surely it's not dangerous, right?

4293
04:56:33,760 --> 04:56:34,580
Oh, not you.

4294
04:56:34,960 --> 04:56:35,440
Not you.

4295
04:56:36,960 --> 04:56:37,720
Okay, that's fine.

4296
04:56:38,960 --> 04:56:39,900
God, get you up.

4297
04:56:40,200 --> 04:56:40,760
Get out of here.

4298
04:56:40,960 --> 04:56:41,480
Get out of here.

4299
04:56:43,680 --> 04:56:45,740
Okay, I'm just...

4300
04:56:45,740 --> 04:56:46,960
I swear to God.

4301
04:56:47,760 --> 04:56:48,560
I swear to God.

4302
04:56:48,900 --> 04:56:49,440
Get out of here.

4303
04:56:54,120 --> 04:56:54,260
There you go.

4304
04:56:54,500 --> 04:56:56,260
I have to use boomerans on these guys.

4305
04:56:57,920 --> 04:56:58,080
Oh!

4306
04:56:59,500 --> 04:57:00,940
Got too close.

4307
04:57:01,360 --> 04:57:02,380
Oh my god!

4308
04:57:02,940 --> 04:57:03,820
Okay, it's fine.

4309
04:57:04,400 --> 04:57:04,820
We're in.

4310
04:57:07,040 --> 04:57:08,180
I'm just gonna use that.

4311
04:57:08,580 --> 04:57:08,960
Fuck that.

4312
04:57:10,480 --> 04:57:12,040
You gotta slowly walk up.

4313
04:57:13,140 --> 04:57:13,500
This.

4314
04:57:18,190 --> 04:57:18,990
Oh my god.

4315
04:57:19,210 --> 04:57:20,390
Oh my god!

4316
04:57:22,770 --> 04:57:23,710
I lived.

4317
04:57:24,850 --> 04:57:26,790
I live, fools!

4318
04:57:28,530 --> 04:57:29,510
That's right!

4319
04:57:32,010 --> 04:57:32,750
Oh, it's here.

4320
04:57:33,050 --> 04:57:33,590
Wait, what?

4321
04:57:34,870 --> 04:57:36,530
Where did you finish exploring?

4322
04:57:37,250 --> 04:57:38,030
Wait, what?

4323
04:57:43,750 --> 04:57:44,170
Hmm.

4324
04:57:44,470 --> 04:57:46,050
I don't know.

4325
04:57:46,990 --> 04:57:47,830
Do I need to?

4326
04:57:50,290 --> 04:57:52,410
Oh, I can go back an item to your left?

4327
04:57:52,550 --> 04:57:52,770
Where?

4328
04:57:53,590 --> 04:57:54,990
I already did all this stuff.

4329
04:57:56,290 --> 04:57:57,390
Oh, here!

4330
04:58:01,410 --> 04:58:30,690
all right oh that's where she was talking oh there she is i was like why do i hear master you seen the lone maker left in the citadel are you my enemy the other constructors this place place object aggressively to my presence bug red i am a maker yes enemy no i am an architect only an architect it's a bad automate is not a choice it is our nature directive cage You are a weave type,

4331
04:58:30,770 --> 04:58:31,010
yes?

4332
04:58:31,170 --> 04:58:31,890
A first child.

4333
04:58:33,390 --> 04:58:33,950
Extinct?

4334
04:58:34,290 --> 04:58:34,690
Or not?

4335
04:58:34,870 --> 04:58:35,710
It does so seem.

4336
04:58:35,950 --> 04:58:36,450
That's fine.

4337
04:58:36,810 --> 04:58:37,870
You see, a true master.

4338
04:58:38,910 --> 04:58:41,730
I bear the linkage of weavers along with other strands.

4339
04:58:42,070 --> 04:58:42,910
Equally strange.

4340
04:58:43,870 --> 04:58:50,050
Then on your request, Bugret, I direct the road of the demands for farmless first children in our kingdom eternal.

4341
04:58:50,630 --> 04:58:51,270
I shall serve.

4342
04:58:51,610 --> 04:58:52,910
I shall cook a craft.

4343
04:58:54,510 --> 04:58:55,130
Oh, nice.

4344
04:58:55,270 --> 04:58:55,890
It's a store.

4345
04:58:57,790 --> 04:58:58,350
Um...

4346
04:58:59,690 --> 04:59:01,050
Okay, I think that's actually good.

4347
04:59:03,030 --> 04:59:05,170
Oh, wait, I should get this, right?

4348
04:59:10,330 --> 04:59:11,370
Get this?

4349
04:59:14,430 --> 04:59:15,610
Everything is good?

4350
04:59:16,730 --> 04:59:18,650
Do I have enough stuff for it?

4351
04:59:20,890 --> 04:59:22,850
This, the cobwood wheel?

4352
04:59:23,810 --> 04:59:24,410
Okay, technique.

4353
04:59:24,470 --> 04:59:29,050
I'll buy the crafting tool kit so I can first.

4354
04:59:29,290 --> 04:59:31,030
And then...

4355
04:59:32,970 --> 04:59:34,710
I mean, I do have a V.

4356
04:59:34,730 --> 04:59:37,410
I keep pressing the wrong one.

4357
04:59:37,490 --> 04:59:38,150
I have one beat.

4358
04:59:38,370 --> 04:59:39,370
I can grab one more.

4359
04:59:40,030 --> 04:59:40,490
All right.

4360
04:59:41,290 --> 04:59:41,990
All right, guys.

4361
04:59:44,170 --> 04:59:45,410
In my mind, I'm here.

4362
04:59:45,610 --> 04:59:47,930
At the height of a corridor means system near complete.

4363
04:59:48,630 --> 04:59:51,010
Construct old builds that sound our song.

4364
04:59:51,390 --> 04:59:53,670
They mean only to be set, function, and form.

4365
04:59:54,730 --> 04:59:55,050
All right.

4366
04:59:55,810 --> 04:59:56,730
This one?

4367
04:59:59,670 --> 05:00:00,930
It's the scuttlebug.

4368
05:00:01,310 --> 05:00:02,070
But up, but up.

4369
05:00:03,690 --> 05:00:04,230
Oh.

4370
05:00:04,230 --> 05:00:04,710
Oh.

4371
05:00:04,730 --> 05:00:07,410
Um, wheel is nutty?

4372
05:00:09,230 --> 05:00:11,370
Alright, we can't afford...

4373
05:00:11,370 --> 05:00:12,610
We can't afford two more.

4374
05:00:14,430 --> 05:00:16,370
Alright, I'll get the cog wheel.

4375
05:00:17,250 --> 05:00:19,090
Oh, that requires the thing.

4376
05:00:20,070 --> 05:00:21,730
Alright, wheel is strong.

4377
05:00:21,850 --> 05:00:23,050
Okay, we'll try it out.

4378
05:00:23,690 --> 05:00:24,630
Should I grab a key?

4379
05:00:25,010 --> 05:00:26,730
Actually, I can...

4380
05:00:28,970 --> 05:00:30,470
Alright, do I buy a key?

4381
05:00:34,690 --> 05:00:36,190
Oh, I need...

4382
05:00:37,070 --> 05:00:39,930
Oh, I need five tools to grab it.

4383
05:00:40,410 --> 05:00:41,450
Oh, I thought I could.

4384
05:00:42,550 --> 05:00:43,030
Hoopsie.

4385
05:00:45,070 --> 05:00:47,490
Okay, now I just...

4386
05:00:47,490 --> 05:00:49,450
I like that boomerang.

4387
05:00:49,570 --> 05:00:50,830
The boomerang's good.

4388
05:00:51,030 --> 05:00:52,210
So I'll put this here.

4389
05:00:53,450 --> 05:00:54,550
Alright, what do we do?

4390
05:00:56,510 --> 05:00:57,830
Where do I go?

4391
05:00:59,790 --> 05:01:01,630
Pariah, they give me a super chat they can think.

4392
05:01:01,730 --> 05:01:02,610
Yeah, I'm still awake.

4393
05:01:03,070 --> 05:01:05,590
I'll fight one more boss before I call it.

4394
05:01:07,850 --> 05:01:09,670
That's it, chair.

4395
05:01:11,970 --> 05:01:12,510
Um...

4396
05:01:12,510 --> 05:01:13,030
Whoa!

4397
05:01:15,950 --> 05:01:17,990
Go down left and then left.

4398
05:01:18,370 --> 05:01:20,130
Oh my god, it goes zoomings.

4399
05:01:20,970 --> 05:01:21,890
It goes room.

4400
05:01:27,310 --> 05:01:28,890
Uh, where do we go?

4401
05:01:29,230 --> 05:01:29,770
Is it?

4402
05:01:30,150 --> 05:01:31,350
Do we go all the way...

4403
05:01:31,350 --> 05:01:31,570
Wait.

4404
05:01:32,810 --> 05:01:33,310
Here?

4405
05:01:35,730 --> 05:01:37,190
Maybe I'll go all the way here.

4406
05:01:40,700 --> 05:01:42,000
Go down the hole.

4407
05:01:42,200 --> 05:01:42,380
Oh, wait.

4408
05:01:42,440 --> 05:01:42,940
There is something.

4409
05:01:43,080 --> 05:01:44,140
There's something down the hole.

4410
05:01:44,360 --> 05:01:45,020
I didn't see that.

4411
05:01:45,720 --> 05:01:46,080
Jesus.

4412
05:01:48,920 --> 05:01:49,360
Whoa.

4413
05:01:51,200 --> 05:01:51,200
Whoa.

4414
05:01:51,800 --> 05:01:52,420
No touchy.

4415
05:01:53,180 --> 05:01:54,300
No touchy.

4416
05:01:55,440 --> 05:01:56,880
Oh, God, not these guys.

4417
05:01:57,060 --> 05:01:57,440
I hate you.

4418
05:02:00,020 --> 05:02:00,840
There you go.

4419
05:02:03,860 --> 05:02:04,720
Oh, my God.

4420
05:02:05,020 --> 05:02:05,620
Oh, my God.

4421
05:02:05,780 --> 05:02:06,020
I didn't realize.

4422
05:02:06,220 --> 05:02:08,100
I did not realize there's more.

4423
05:02:08,960 --> 05:02:10,540

05:02:12,060 --> 05:02:19,040

4430
05:03:30,690 --> 05:03:31,750
I was like, where do I go?

4431
05:03:35,720 --> 05:03:37,000
I'm so confused.

4432
05:03:40,860 --> 05:03:41,640
Drop down here.

4433
05:03:43,220 --> 05:03:43,840
Oh, here.

4434
05:03:45,540 --> 05:03:46,260
Oh, hey.

4435
05:03:46,640 --> 05:03:47,720
There's a guy here.

4436
05:03:54,830 --> 05:03:55,790
Oh, there we go.

4437
05:03:57,870 --> 05:03:58,350
Wait.

4438
05:03:58,650 --> 05:03:59,350
I opened that?

4439
05:03:59,430 --> 05:04:00,310
Wait, no, I opened this.

4440
05:04:00,390 --> 05:04:00,690
I remember.

4441
05:04:01,010 --> 05:04:01,570
Yeah, I opened it.

4442
05:04:01,590 --> 05:04:02,590
I remember opening it.

4443
05:04:04,670 --> 05:04:05,710
Oh, nice.

4444
05:04:07,170 --> 05:04:08,330
About a bridge.

4445
05:04:10,390 --> 05:04:11,310
Is there anything else here?

4446
05:04:14,290 --> 05:04:15,550
Oh, there you go.

4447
05:04:17,210 --> 05:04:17,890
Yes, please.

4448
05:04:20,690 --> 05:04:22,650
Okay, now I have the elevator.

4449
05:04:25,230 --> 05:04:27,410
This doesn't show on my marker, though.

4450
05:04:27,610 --> 05:04:28,330
That's the thing.

4451
05:04:29,070 --> 05:04:30,590
There must be like...

4452
05:04:31,590 --> 05:04:33,030
There must be somewhere where it...

4453
05:04:33,650 --> 05:04:36,590
There must be somewhere where it, like, shows the...

4454
05:04:38,570 --> 05:04:39,050
Uh...

4455
05:04:39,050 --> 05:04:40,230
Oh, I've been here.

4456
05:04:42,850 --> 05:04:44,910
Oh, I need a buy from Shakira.

4457
05:04:45,290 --> 05:04:45,650
Oh!

4458
05:04:47,990 --> 05:04:49,950
That... I've been here before, right?

4459
05:04:50,170 --> 05:04:50,850
Yeah, I have.

4460
05:04:51,830 --> 05:04:52,970
Okay, we go this way.

4461
05:05:02,640 --> 05:05:03,160
Let me out!

4462
05:05:03,220 --> 05:05:03,800
Let me out!

4463
05:05:08,700 --> 05:05:09,180
Uh...

4464
05:05:09,180 --> 05:05:10,800
Okay, first try.

4465
05:05:11,140 --> 05:05:19,160
Yeah, because I want I want a pin to know where the elevators are Because I'm confused Is she in the bell area?

4466
05:05:25,430 --> 05:05:30,830
Sit down Ahoy Ahoy She's not here

4467
05:05:35,600 --> 05:05:44,320
Down and right to the bell way Oh, she's in bell heart Oh, okay, where the fuck is bell heart

4468
05:05:50,320 --> 05:05:53,140
Guys, what do you mean by that?

4469
05:05:53,260 --> 05:05:54,600
Where the fuck is Bellheart?

4470
05:05:57,480 --> 05:05:59,020
Alright, what does he want?

4471
05:05:59,580 --> 05:06:00,960
What does this Boomer want?

4472
05:06:01,480 --> 05:06:06,020
Oh, I'll see here what your trash behavior has route, Bellringer.

4473
05:06:06,760 --> 05:06:10,920
Just as I predicted, this one's peaceful sanctuary is now crawling with all sorts.

4474
05:06:11,760 --> 05:06:16,480
With the beginnings of a shabby little settlement all huddled around this old shrine.

4475
05:06:19,620 --> 05:06:24,360
These poor bugs are all victims of the city on this insidious attraction.

4476
05:06:24,800 --> 05:06:28,860
This place draws them up into its maw, only to consume them utterly.

4477
05:06:29,180 --> 05:06:33,400
Inside and out, nothing but a grand gilded lie.

4478
05:06:33,720 --> 05:06:36,460
Well, at least these few stragglers can enjoy a moment's safety.

4479
05:06:36,920 --> 05:06:37,800
Poor fools.

4480
05:06:39,040 --> 05:06:39,540
That's it.

4481
05:06:39,760 --> 05:06:41,040
You just want to be racist to me?

4482
05:06:42,480 --> 05:06:45,500
He caught me over there so he can be racist to me.

4483
05:06:45,560 --> 05:06:46,300
That's crazy.

4484
05:06:46,300 --> 05:06:47,200

4485
05:06:50,290 --> 05:07:07,390

4487
05:07:26,260 --> 05:07:26,660
Three.

4488
05:07:27,180 --> 05:07:28,440
There was no three, guys.

4489
05:07:29,180 --> 05:07:30,020
There was only two.

4490
05:07:30,220 --> 05:07:31,120
Oh my god.

4491
05:07:31,740 --> 05:07:32,860
I still hit myself.

4492
05:07:36,000 --> 05:07:37,340
Oh, I forgot to get... Oh, whatever.

4493
05:07:37,520 --> 05:07:37,820
It's fine.

4494
05:07:38,080 --> 05:07:38,840
We don't need it.

4495
05:07:40,920 --> 05:07:41,640
Are you serious?

4496
05:07:41,900 --> 05:07:43,260
The random bell out of nowhere?

4497
05:07:45,000 --> 05:07:45,760
Oh my god.

4498
05:07:45,920 --> 05:07:46,780
She's gonna kill me.

4499
05:07:47,200 --> 05:07:48,320
She's actually gonna kill me.

4500
05:07:48,400 --> 05:07:48,960
Okay, it's fine.

4501
05:07:49,200 --> 05:07:49,600
It's fine.

4502
05:07:50,000 --> 05:07:50,460
We're fine.

4503
05:07:52,160 --> 05:07:53,180
Oh my god, I can do this again.

4504
05:07:56,630 --> 05:07:57,590
There you go.

4505
05:07:58,330 --> 05:08:00,130
I forgot to get rid of my...

4506
05:08:01,690 --> 05:08:03,550
Oh wait, there was silkier.

4507
05:08:03,850 --> 05:08:04,690
I should need that.

4508
05:08:05,650 --> 05:08:07,510
I had to get rid of the magma thing.

4509
05:08:07,810 --> 05:08:08,130
That's fine.

4510
05:08:08,250 --> 05:08:09,170
We don't need... We don't care.

4511
05:08:10,690 --> 05:08:11,250
That's fine.

4512
05:08:12,090 --> 05:08:14,730
Surely I'll find another... I'll find another bench down here.

4513
05:08:15,030 --> 05:08:15,510
I believe.

4514
05:08:21,010 --> 05:08:21,930
This way.

4515
05:08:22,270 --> 05:08:23,230
Down I'll go.

4516
05:08:24,250 --> 05:08:24,550
Yeah?

4517
05:08:25,090 --> 05:08:26,090
Wait, what is here?

4518
05:08:27,110 --> 05:08:27,490
Hello?

4519
05:08:27,550 --> 05:08:30,330
Great bugs, ye who weep as your kingdom phase.

4520
05:08:30,650 --> 05:08:31,630
Join me upon the stage.

4521
05:08:32,050 --> 05:08:34,550
Together we shall inflame the passion of fireloom.

4522
05:08:35,610 --> 05:08:37,670
Not allowed to be here, apparently.

4523
05:08:39,290 --> 05:08:39,770
Oh, here.

4524
05:08:40,230 --> 05:08:40,570
Tram.

4525
05:08:42,230 --> 05:08:43,650
Oh, see, I told you.

4526
05:08:44,090 --> 05:08:45,230
I told you guys.

4527
05:08:45,470 --> 05:08:47,010
I knew there was a tram here.

4528
05:08:54,230 --> 05:08:54,890
Knock, knock.

4529
05:08:57,470 --> 05:08:58,030
Yay!

4530
05:09:02,480 --> 05:09:03,920
My little bug was...

4531
05:09:03,940 --> 05:09:05,040
be here now.

4532
05:09:07,660 --> 05:09:07,860
Alright.

4533
05:09:08,980 --> 05:09:11,280
We need to...

4534
05:09:11,280 --> 05:09:13,860
We need to get rid of the magma.

4535
05:09:15,120 --> 05:09:16,040
What is I using?

4536
05:09:17,200 --> 05:09:17,600
Poison.

4537
05:09:17,840 --> 05:09:19,420
There you go.

4538
05:09:22,490 --> 05:09:23,070
Okay, I'll...

4539
05:09:23,070 --> 05:09:23,390
Nice.

4540
05:09:26,550 --> 05:09:31,590
What if I just never get money or spend money ever again?

4541
05:09:35,390 --> 05:09:36,150
Damn it.

4542
05:09:39,110 --> 05:09:40,890
And we gotta grab some money.

4543
05:09:41,470 --> 05:09:42,270
We just need $80.

4544
05:09:45,230 --> 05:09:46,590
Alright, that should be enough.

4545
05:09:48,370 --> 05:09:49,610
Rest in peace, funny number.

4546
05:09:49,810 --> 05:09:51,630
But we gotta progress the game.

4547
05:09:52,770 --> 05:09:54,470
Alright, and then we buy the elevator.

4548
05:09:55,930 --> 05:09:56,730
I can't believe it.

4549
05:09:56,750 --> 05:09:57,670
I'm already poor.

4550
05:09:59,350 --> 05:10:00,970
I hate super capitalism.

4551
05:10:02,370 --> 05:10:03,470
I'm already poor.

4552
05:10:06,470 --> 05:10:07,570
Oh my god, I forgot.

4553
05:10:08,210 --> 05:10:09,110
for her too.

4554
05:10:11,410 --> 05:10:13,570
I need more for...

4555
05:10:14,350 --> 05:10:15,050
There we go.

4556
05:10:15,150 --> 05:10:16,670
How much do I need for Shakira?

4557
05:10:18,950 --> 05:10:20,470
Remember when we got 800?

4558
05:10:20,910 --> 05:10:22,790
Those were the good old days.

4559
05:10:23,910 --> 05:10:25,970
Those were the good old days.

4560
05:10:28,970 --> 05:10:29,390
80?

4561
05:10:30,630 --> 05:10:31,190
Okay.

4562
05:10:33,450 --> 05:10:34,870
I'll just pardon these guys.

4563
05:10:36,690 --> 05:10:38,190
These guys give me like...

4564
05:10:38,210 --> 05:10:38,790
30.

4565
05:10:47,520 --> 05:10:48,420
Alright, here I go.

4566
05:10:48,660 --> 05:10:48,900
Ow.

4567
05:10:49,160 --> 05:10:50,040
I hit my head.

4568
05:10:54,270 --> 05:10:55,010
There we go.

4569
05:10:56,010 --> 05:10:56,370
Alright, Dash.

4570
05:10:56,450 --> 05:10:56,830
Oh, nice.

4571
05:10:56,890 --> 05:10:57,570
Then I got silk.

4572
05:10:58,190 --> 05:10:58,630
Nice.

4573
05:10:59,150 --> 05:11:00,770
Oh, I keep forgetting to pick these up.

4574
05:11:01,570 --> 05:11:03,410
The one mission that keeps telling me to do.

4575
05:11:03,850 --> 05:11:06,150
This guy's been, like, waiting there for 20 years.

4576
05:11:06,210 --> 05:11:08,190
Like, she'll eventually do my mission.

4577
05:11:08,590 --> 05:11:09,710
She'll come back, right?

4578
05:11:10,610 --> 05:11:12,730
Alright, she's in Bellheart, right?

4579
05:11:15,370 --> 05:11:15,970
Oh, wait.

4580
05:11:15,970 --> 05:11:16,410
Not here.

4581
05:11:23,030 --> 05:11:24,250
Where is she at?

4582
05:11:27,610 --> 05:11:27,830
Alright.

4583
05:11:28,470 --> 05:11:29,070
Bellheart.

4584
05:11:33,310 --> 05:11:34,350
Ooh, cello.

4585
05:11:34,590 --> 05:11:35,770
I haven't seen her so long.

4586
05:11:40,470 --> 05:11:42,350
I don't hear her singing, though.

4587
05:11:44,830 --> 05:11:45,550
Where's her singing?

4588
05:11:46,910 --> 05:11:47,190
Oh!

4589
05:11:47,410 --> 05:11:48,270
Ooh, cello!

4590
05:11:48,690 --> 05:11:49,370
I hear!

4591
05:11:52,050 --> 05:11:52,950
I hear!

4592
05:11:55,590 --> 05:11:57,290
Oh, okay, never mind.

4593
05:11:57,430 --> 05:11:58,390
I'm just hearing my voices.

4594
05:11:58,690 --> 05:11:59,050
Never mind.

4595
05:12:00,710 --> 05:12:01,450
Wait, unless...

4596
05:12:01,450 --> 05:12:02,010
Oh, I hear!

4597
05:12:02,410 --> 05:12:03,630
Oh, chill-o!

4598
05:12:05,250 --> 05:12:05,730
Chikira!

4599
05:12:06,690 --> 05:12:08,330
Poshanka, child-wielding kneel.

4600
05:12:09,170 --> 05:12:11,210
This heart home is cut free of its curse.

4601
05:12:11,630 --> 05:12:13,850
Tell me, was it your blade I brought in saving?

4602
05:12:14,430 --> 05:12:16,690
My shock would be great if another hero managed to feed.

4603
05:12:17,530 --> 05:12:19,610
I slew a tall creature above the town.

4604
05:12:20,470 --> 05:12:23,770
A weaver, I suspect, the one twisted in purpose.

4605
05:12:25,430 --> 05:12:27,570
By voice and claw it aided.

4606
05:12:28,330 --> 05:12:30,310
Perhaps guided the thread that strung the town.

4607
05:12:31,050 --> 05:12:31,290
Weaver?

4608
05:12:31,630 --> 05:12:32,870
Those vicious old things.

4609
05:12:33,190 --> 05:12:34,590
Pure young we tell the tales.

4610
05:12:35,050 --> 05:12:36,610
But I thought them long dead.

4611
05:12:37,050 --> 05:12:39,550
Only corpses bound in spires.

4612
05:12:40,710 --> 05:12:42,170
This one still lived, though.

4613
05:12:44,590 --> 05:12:48,190
If I was a weaver, it was broken in a savage way.

4614
05:12:48,790 --> 05:12:51,890
Its own silk was bound, pinned deep within a shell.

4615
05:12:52,350 --> 05:12:53,250
A cruel punishment.

4616
05:12:54,130 --> 05:12:56,530
Um, I'm not before witnessed.

4617
05:12:57,370 --> 05:12:59,390
Even broken, my envy remains.

4618
05:12:59,830 --> 05:13:01,630
A Weaver's favotel skill.

4619
05:13:02,110 --> 05:13:05,250
To meet one in combat means great challenge and great pride in victory.

4620
05:13:06,310 --> 05:13:06,510
Alright.

4621
05:13:06,910 --> 05:13:07,490
Where is it?

4622
05:13:07,570 --> 05:13:09,050
Wait, she doesn't even have it.

4623
05:13:09,530 --> 05:13:10,350
What the fuck?

4624
05:13:11,470 --> 05:13:11,910
What?

4625
05:13:12,770 --> 05:13:14,030
She doesn't even have it.

4626
05:13:14,730 --> 05:13:15,610
You liar?

4627
05:13:16,010 --> 05:13:16,590
You're not a.

4628
05:13:17,970 --> 05:13:19,590
Shakira, do you not have... Oh, wait.

4629
05:13:20,210 --> 05:13:20,990
Oh, there you go.

4630
05:13:21,050 --> 05:13:21,290
Never mind.

4631
05:13:21,330 --> 05:13:22,070
I think Dr. Yen.

4632
05:13:22,490 --> 05:13:23,850
I was like, you liar?

4633
05:13:26,690 --> 05:13:52,270
She was like I don't understand what this is So I never made a I never made a pin for it Like pretty useful to me What do you describe sound as hideous Yeah I was going to be a She's like It's unnatural And that's why I don't make pins for it I shall So if it will aid you I shall craft the pin Seek me a moment not long from now The pins will be carved And we may trade Alright

4634
05:13:55,810 --> 05:13:57,350
Did she make it yet?

4635
05:13:57,690 --> 05:13:59,410
Wait, when does she make it?

4636
05:14:01,110 --> 05:14:04,330
Go to the slab and the mountain and she should have it?

4637
05:14:05,350 --> 05:14:06,510
Okay, so I have to go to the slab.

4638
05:14:08,910 --> 05:14:12,790
I just want to fight one more boss before I...

4639
05:14:12,790 --> 05:14:14,210
Oh, rest and come back?

4640
05:14:14,350 --> 05:14:14,790
Oh, okay.

4641
05:14:17,750 --> 05:14:18,650
Alright, she should have had it.

4642
05:14:19,110 --> 05:14:20,750
Guys, which is the closest boss?

4643
05:14:21,750 --> 05:14:24,350
I want to fight one more boss Right.

4644
05:14:24,950 --> 05:14:25,830
Clock out.

4645
05:14:28,750 --> 05:14:30,250
Oh, it'll take a while?

4646
05:14:30,470 --> 05:14:30,710
Okay.

4647
05:14:31,070 --> 05:14:31,870
I guess...

4648
05:14:31,870 --> 05:14:33,350
Wait, she didn't make it!

4649
05:14:36,330 --> 05:14:37,790
Oh, it's time...

4650
05:14:37,790 --> 05:14:40,370
It's time to go climb a mountain.

4651
05:14:40,770 --> 05:14:42,390
I gotta do my own pilgrimage.

4652
05:14:43,490 --> 05:14:44,150
And not rest.

4653
05:14:44,610 --> 05:14:45,290
I'm resting.

4654
05:14:51,370 --> 05:14:54,210
Oh, I need to rest outside the room.

4655
05:14:54,470 --> 05:14:54,770
Oh!

4656
05:15:02,550 --> 05:15:03,810
Where's the closest bench?

4657
05:15:18,020 --> 05:15:19,700
Alright, I'm resting outside.

4658
05:15:23,060 --> 05:15:24,480
It's like here.

4659
05:15:25,740 --> 05:15:27,260
Bro, fuck off!

4660
05:15:29,240 --> 05:15:31,260
Try and find a bench!

4661
05:15:33,740 --> 05:15:34,420
Bitch?

4662
05:15:36,520 --> 05:15:37,680
Oh my god, it's this way.

4663
05:15:46,070 --> 05:15:47,210
Alright, here we go.

4664
05:15:51,530 --> 05:15:51,970
Alright.

4665
05:15:53,210 --> 05:15:54,390
Okay, I rested.

4666
05:15:54,630 --> 05:15:56,030
Oh shit!

4667
05:15:56,590 --> 05:15:58,570
I did not mean to get caged.

4668
05:15:59,990 --> 05:16:01,190
Caged for my crimes.

4669
05:16:01,510 --> 05:16:02,370
Against humanity.

4670
05:16:11,530 --> 05:16:11,770
Alright.

4671
05:16:12,850 --> 05:16:14,410
This is my baby Joe.

4672
05:16:20,490 --> 05:16:21,350
Alright, this way.

4673
05:16:23,550 --> 05:16:24,830
Alright, now.

4674
05:16:25,450 --> 05:16:26,630
You should make my thing, right?

05:16:27,750 --> 05:16:28,450
Oh hey.

4676
05:16:29,690 --> 05:16:30,030
Oh.

05:16:30,570 --> 05:16:31,230
No.

4678
05:16:33,170 --> 05:16:34,890

Oh my god, $400?

05:16:43,860 --> 05:16:45,620
Let's go this way.

4681
05:16:46,700 --> 05:16:48,260
Rich does not need to get richer.

4682
05:16:50,620 --> 05:16:52,060
Did she make it?

4683
05:16:53,720 --> 05:16:56,000
We must learn from them, child weaving needle.

4684
05:16:56,400 --> 05:17:00,100
Peace is a slow poison that would wither even the hardiest bugs.

4685
05:17:00,200 --> 05:17:00,580
Oh, yay!

4686
05:17:00,780 --> 05:17:01,540

Oh, there it is.

I don't have a second key.

4697
05:18:34,640 --> 05:18:35,440
I only have one key.

4698
05:18:36,860 --> 05:18:38,260
Oh, the haunted hospital.

4699
05:18:39,640 --> 05:18:41,720
Wait, but I don't have a second key.

4700
05:18:45,840 --> 05:18:47,480
Oh, my key is in there.

4701
05:18:47,580 --> 05:18:47,900
Okay.

05:18:48,520 --> 05:18:49,680
Alright, where's the key?

4703
05:18:54,710 --> 05:18:56,530
It's a secret key.

4704
05:18:59,190 --> 05:19:00,150
Where is it?

4705
05:19:00,210 --> 05:19:01,290

Yeah?

4708
05:19:11,090 --> 05:19:11,090
Okay.

4709
05:19:13,170 --> 05:19:13,830
Alright, let's go.

4710
05:19:22,270 --> 05:19:23,470
I was supposed to end stream at 4.

4711
05:19:27,270 --> 05:19:30,290
I was supposed to end stream for 4...

4712
05:19:30,290 --> 05:19:31,750
I was supposed to stream for 4 hours.

4713
05:19:32,090 --> 05:19:35,490
Now it's almost at the six hour mark.

4714
05:19:36,730 --> 05:19:39,210
Oh, silk, silly silk sock.

4715
05:19:39,570 --> 05:19:41,450
Silly silk sock.

4716
05:19:45,830 --> 05:19:47,730
Silk song is so silly.

4717
05:19:51,670 --> 05:19:52,870
This way.

4718
05:19:56,330 --> 05:19:58,870
Oh my god, Kobe.

4719
05:20:00,810 --> 05:20:02,570
Sign this man up for the NFL.

4720
05:20:03,670 --> 05:20:04,710
Or NBA.

4721
05:20:05,130 --> 05:20:06,270
Whichever one is...

4722
05:20:06,270 --> 05:20:08,530
Whichever one pays more for throwing a ball.

4723
05:20:10,490 --> 05:20:12,130
Okay, white word is here.

4724
05:20:14,490 --> 05:20:15,170
What's this?

4725
05:20:16,490 --> 05:20:17,990
Oh, it's one of the missions.

4726
05:20:20,930 --> 05:20:23,290
Okay, let's find this missing person.

4727
05:20:29,000 --> 05:20:29,720
Where did he go?

4728
05:20:32,990 --> 05:20:34,650
Oh shit, okay, we don't care.

4729
05:20:35,850 --> 05:20:37,870
Trying to find... I'm trying to find this missing person.

4730
05:20:38,210 --> 05:20:40,130
Okay, this way.

4731
05:20:43,870 --> 05:20:45,410
Oh my god, they're parkour.

4732
05:20:51,690 --> 05:20:53,250
Oh my...

4733
05:20:54,650 --> 05:20:55,650
Oh, there it is.

4734
05:20:56,910 --> 05:20:58,190
Okay, never mind.

4735
05:20:58,350 --> 05:20:59,650
She went down!

4736
05:21:03,210 --> 05:21:05,730
She's like, I'm tired now.

4737
05:21:07,530 --> 05:21:09,390
Oh my god.

4738
05:21:10,110 --> 05:21:11,530
She's like, I'm EP.

4739
05:21:15,210 --> 05:21:16,810
Where did she go?

4740
05:21:18,070 --> 05:21:18,930
Oh my god, it's that...

4741
05:21:18,930 --> 05:21:19,730
No, that's not her.

4742
05:21:21,450 --> 05:21:22,230
That's it.

4743
05:21:24,030 --> 05:21:24,670
That's it.

4744
05:21:26,650 --> 05:21:32,070
There we go.

4745
05:21:35,370 --> 05:21:36,450
Oh my god.

4746
05:21:36,830 --> 05:21:37,950
It's okay, we're fine.

4747
05:21:38,650 --> 05:21:39,450
Where did she go?

4748
05:21:40,010 --> 05:21:41,830
Oh, there she is.

4749
05:21:44,630 --> 05:21:47,190
Oh, what a turn.

4750
05:21:47,210 --> 05:22:19,710
I fear twas not but myself felt let's see how did you parkour all of that you don't even have wings I bet you're carrying like 600 pounds of equipment it seems this old bug's luck has not yet worn then it was more than luck that saw me to you madam I promise to wish up bugs concerned for your safety parkour granny I urge you to head heed their way now beside the old up and over.

4751
05:22:20,310 --> 05:22:23,550
A small settlement has formed there, and the bell we awakened.

4752
05:22:24,130 --> 05:22:26,510
Seems to ward away the worst of the citadel's many danger.

4753
05:22:27,430 --> 05:22:30,570
A settlement in these long haunted halls.

4754
05:22:31,150 --> 05:22:33,990
Are you telling naughty lies, dear one?

4755
05:22:34,330 --> 05:22:38,510
Well, I suppose there's not too much danger in going to see in the truth for myself.

4756
05:22:39,330 --> 05:22:39,910
Alright, nice.

4757
05:22:39,970 --> 05:22:41,310
We got the wandering merchant.

4758
05:22:42,010 --> 05:22:42,490
Alright, guys.

4759
05:22:42,550 --> 05:22:45,370
I think before next stream, I'm gonna farm some rosaries.

4760
05:22:45,890 --> 05:22:48,630
We have so many merchants that we bought nothing from.

4761
05:22:48,670 --> 05:22:50,010
because we're broke as hell.

4762
05:22:52,710 --> 05:22:54,590
And leave me to gather up my trinkets and bubbles.

4763
05:22:55,130 --> 05:22:59,970
If the sentiments of yours truly has bug cell safe, I'll be able to make some lucrative trades.

4764
05:23:00,190 --> 05:23:01,150
Blessings and farewell.

4765
05:23:02,190 --> 05:23:02,730
Alright.

4766
05:23:03,470 --> 05:23:06,770
Before next stream, I am definitely gonna...

4767
05:23:06,770 --> 05:23:09,050
I'm definitely gonna farm some rosaries.

4768
05:23:09,870 --> 05:23:10,790
This is crazy.

4769
05:23:10,890 --> 05:23:16,370
There's too much... I swear I'm missing so many upgrades because I'm just fucking broke.

4770
05:23:17,550 --> 05:23:17,970
Wait.

4771
05:23:18,210 --> 05:23:18,650
Where is it?

4772
05:23:18,670 --> 05:23:19,110
it yet.

4773
05:23:21,910 --> 05:23:23,250
It's down here.

4774
05:23:28,130 --> 05:23:28,570
Here?

4775
05:23:37,830 --> 05:23:38,930
Oh, yeah, the bench.

4776
05:23:39,990 --> 05:23:40,970
I'll go get the bench.

4777
05:23:43,190 --> 05:23:44,250
I forgot about the bench.

4778
05:23:47,690 --> 05:23:50,250
I'll make sure I don't accidentally hit the elevator, though.

4779
05:23:51,450 --> 05:23:53,290
Alright, oh yeah, and then...

4780
05:23:53,290 --> 05:23:54,370
Yeah, no, I already got everything.

4781
05:23:59,270 --> 05:23:59,930
Is it here?

4782
05:24:01,650 --> 05:24:02,090
Okay.

4783
05:24:02,110 --> 05:24:02,970
Yeah?

4784
05:24:05,750 --> 05:24:06,870
Where's the secret key?

4785
05:24:12,680 --> 05:24:13,100
Right?

4786
05:24:20,080 --> 05:24:21,820
Down then far right.

4787
05:24:26,120 --> 05:24:27,280
I hate these guys.

4788
05:24:27,680 --> 05:24:29,120
I don't want waste stuff though.

4789
05:24:31,320 --> 05:24:33,020
Is there anything secret here?

4790
05:24:35,500 --> 05:24:36,720
Fuck this guy.

4791
05:24:37,880 --> 05:24:38,440
Now up.

4792
05:24:38,540 --> 05:24:38,920
Oh here.

4793
05:24:39,100 --> 05:24:39,420
Okay.

4794
05:24:39,420 --> 05:24:44,420
I go right over there.

4795
05:24:46,240 --> 05:24:48,000
Oh, this is the place where I got...

4796
05:24:48,000 --> 05:24:48,240
Okay.

4797
05:24:50,200 --> 05:24:51,440
I didn't go this way.

4798
05:24:52,440 --> 05:24:53,620
Alright, did I?

4799
05:24:53,760 --> 05:24:54,340
I don't remember.

4800
05:24:54,460 --> 05:24:55,020
No, I did.

4801
05:24:56,160 --> 05:24:57,000
Up again.

4802
05:24:58,120 --> 05:24:59,800
How do I go up again?

4803
05:25:00,640 --> 05:25:01,600
Oh, here!

4804
05:25:03,360 --> 05:25:03,840
Oh!

4805
05:25:05,120 --> 05:25:06,540
I was like, guys are stupid.

4806
05:25:06,640 --> 05:25:07,200
What do you mean up?

4807
05:25:08,680 --> 05:25:10,700
I was the stupid one.

4808
05:25:12,380 --> 05:25:15,840
In the end, it was me that stupid.

4809
05:25:18,000 --> 05:25:19,560
My guys are so stupid, I was like.

4810
05:25:21,900 --> 05:25:24,140
By which way, right or left?

4811
05:25:26,940 --> 05:25:28,440
Well, song must be sung.

4812
05:25:28,660 --> 05:25:29,440
None may falter.

4813
05:25:29,800 --> 05:25:30,780
Infirmity, sickness, death.

4814
05:25:31,160 --> 05:25:32,560
All are banished from the citadel.

4815
05:25:32,980 --> 05:25:33,120
Oh.

4816
05:25:34,240 --> 05:25:38,360
I guess like, if you have like a cold, you're like, well, I guess you die.

4817
05:25:43,150 --> 05:25:43,670
Oh.

4818
05:25:43,790 --> 05:25:45,610
How the fuck did that miss?

4819
05:25:48,570 --> 05:25:50,970
I mean, I'm just hanging in there.

4820
05:25:52,830 --> 05:25:53,570
Oh, there is a key.

4821
05:25:56,550 --> 05:25:57,810
Oh, it's this guy.

4822
05:25:58,890 --> 05:25:59,730
He went full silk.

4823
05:26:00,850 --> 05:26:02,490
Guys, never go full silk, guys.

4824
05:26:02,910 --> 05:26:02,930
Remember.

4825
05:26:10,600 --> 05:26:11,340
Alright, nice.

4826
05:26:12,060 --> 05:26:12,900
Now where do I go?

4827
05:26:16,360 --> 05:26:17,420
I got the key.

4828
05:26:20,820 --> 05:26:21,580
What the fuck?

4829
05:26:23,880 --> 05:26:25,760
Now back to the entrance.

4830
05:26:26,020 --> 05:26:27,440
Back to the ornate lock.

4831
05:26:27,640 --> 05:26:28,780
Where the fuck is that?

4832
05:26:30,640 --> 05:26:31,620
Left at the elevator.

4833
05:26:31,720 --> 05:26:32,980
There was another lock?

4834
05:26:33,360 --> 05:26:34,520
I don't even remember.

4835
05:26:36,720 --> 05:26:38,620
I'm just like, there was another one?

4836
05:26:45,540 --> 05:26:47,040
That's near the elevator.

4837
05:26:47,260 --> 05:26:47,460
Okay.

4838
05:26:52,690 --> 05:26:53,210
Near?

4839
05:26:54,130 --> 05:26:54,650
Okay.

4840
05:26:56,250 --> 05:26:58,050
How do I enter the elevator?

4841
05:27:02,080 --> 05:27:03,860
Left of the elevator.

4842
05:27:05,800 --> 05:27:06,320
Wait, how?

4843
05:27:06,780 --> 05:27:07,360
Now what?

4844
05:27:08,860 --> 05:27:10,040
Bottom left.

4845
05:27:12,280 --> 05:27:13,500
Oh, go back.

4846
05:27:16,380 --> 05:27:17,520
Oh, too far.

4847
05:27:17,600 --> 05:27:19,020
Wait, what if I...

4848
05:27:19,020 --> 05:27:20,400
Wait, I want to...

4849
05:27:20,400 --> 05:27:22,060
Apparently I keep telling me to...

4850
05:27:24,560 --> 05:27:25,160
Alright.

4851
05:27:25,480 --> 05:27:26,300
To go down.

4852
05:27:27,340 --> 05:27:28,700
Because there's a secret down here.

4853
05:27:29,440 --> 05:27:30,040
Like...

4854
05:27:30,060 --> 05:27:31,340
All the way down here.

4855
05:27:32,160 --> 05:27:32,920
Oh, there is.

4856
05:27:33,800 --> 05:27:34,220
Nice.

4857
05:27:37,600 --> 05:27:38,920
Here we got more silk.

4858
05:27:41,300 --> 05:27:41,660
Yeah?

4859
05:27:45,370 --> 05:27:47,510
Where was this keyhole fit?

4860
05:27:49,010 --> 05:27:50,490
Oh, I see.

4861
05:27:52,090 --> 05:27:53,730
I see it now.

4862
05:27:59,830 --> 05:28:01,230
Yay, zero survival instincts.

4863
05:28:01,470 --> 05:28:02,090
Let's go.

4864
05:28:03,530 --> 05:28:05,430
Let's go into this deep, dark pit.

4865
05:28:07,450 --> 05:28:08,610
Oh, never mind.

4866
05:28:08,830 --> 05:28:09,750
Okay, no, this boss sucks.

4867
05:28:09,950 --> 05:28:10,530
I can already tell.

4868
05:28:11,190 --> 05:28:11,630
Never mind.

4869
05:28:11,790 --> 05:28:12,930
No, this boss sucks.

4870
05:28:13,530 --> 05:28:14,070
This...

4871
05:28:14,070 --> 05:28:15,910
I can already tell.

4872
05:28:16,350 --> 05:28:17,290
I can't see.

4873
05:28:20,830 --> 05:28:22,130
Wait, not even a boss.

4874
05:28:29,460 --> 05:28:30,660
What the fuck?

4875
05:28:34,190 --> 05:28:35,370
Oh, my God.

4876
05:28:40,440 --> 05:28:41,000
Oh, okay.

4877
05:28:41,200 --> 05:28:42,200
At least I can see now.

4878
05:28:42,740 --> 05:28:44,080
It's little things.

4879
05:28:44,960 --> 05:28:48,150
You know what?

4880
05:28:50,700 --> 05:28:51,760
Saw, saw, oh!

4881
05:28:55,480 --> 05:28:57,780
Oh my god, he's spitting kids!

4882
05:29:00,980 --> 05:29:01,760
Twain.

4883
05:29:02,700 --> 05:29:04,240
Oh my god, he's spitting kids.

4884
05:29:07,480 --> 05:29:08,580
Oh my god.

4885
05:29:09,850 --> 05:29:10,240
Saw!

4886
05:29:11,240 --> 05:29:16,570

Okay.

4894
05:30:45,850 --> 05:30:47,290
I'll just use my weapons for now.

4895
05:30:49,270 --> 05:30:49,990
Oh my god!

4896
05:30:54,930 --> 05:30:55,410
Nice.

05:30:58,290 --> 05:31:00,310
Oh my god, you still got me there!

05:31:03,030 --> 05:31:04,510
Oh, I cannot...

4899
05:31:04,510 --> 05:31:05,390
Are you serious?

4900
05:31:09,510 --> 05:31:11,510
Okay, I have to farm silk off of him though.

4901
05:31:13,850 --> 05:31:15,610
Oh my god, this guy!

4902
05:31:16,890 --> 05:31:17,110
No!

4903
05:31:17,610 --> 05:31:17,610
No!

4904
05:31:17,770 --> 05:31:18,050
No!

4905
05:31:18,270 --> 05:31:18,690
He's so!

4906
05:31:23,240 --> 05:31:25,280
Alright, I do have...

4907
05:31:26,320 --> 05:31:27,620
Oh my, I keep pressing the other one.

4908
05:31:28,480 --> 05:31:31,260
Let's see, I do have... I stored a lot of these.

4909
05:31:33,340 --> 05:31:34,660
Alright, craft, craft, craft.

4910
05:31:39,660 --> 05:31:40,100
I...

4911
05:31:41,720 --> 05:31:44,300
I don't know if I should swap my poke.

4912
05:31:44,420 --> 05:31:46,800
Oh, oh, I can't reach that.

4913
05:31:47,940 --> 05:31:49,060
get down from here?

4914
05:31:49,180 --> 05:31:49,560
Yeah, I can.

4915
05:31:49,640 --> 05:31:50,700
I'll just get down from here.

4916
05:31:51,500 --> 05:31:51,820
Fuck it.

4917
05:31:53,220 --> 05:31:53,860
Actually, no.

4918
05:31:53,920 --> 05:31:55,000
I'm making this hard up for myself.

4919
05:31:55,120 --> 05:31:55,900
What am I fucking doing?

4920
05:31:58,640 --> 05:32:02,000
I should just turn on the elevator, because I can just run straight.

4921
05:32:04,620 --> 05:32:04,980
Wee.

4922
05:32:11,130 --> 05:32:11,490
Okay.

4923
05:32:14,470 --> 05:32:16,370
He just takes up so much of the screen.

4924
05:32:18,250 --> 05:32:20,750
I feel like using tools is good against him, but yeah.

4925
05:32:22,910 --> 05:32:28,990
I just gotta know when to like, when to use tools and when to not use tools.

4926
05:32:38,590 --> 05:32:40,050

They're all around us.

5125
05:48:14,590 --> 05:48:15,210
Bound forever.

Oh, my God.

5151
05:49:44,410 --> 05:49:44,950

05:49:44,950 --> 05:49:46,250

5155
05:49:49,070 --> 05:49:50,090
Okay, guys.

5156
05:49:50,290 --> 05:49:51,370
I need to...

5157
05:49:55,440 --> 05:49:57,240
I need to be forgiven, guys.

5158
05:49:57,380 --> 05:49:58,200
I need to repent.

5159
05:49:58,920 --> 05:50:00,360
Speak confession.

5160
05:50:04,520 --> 05:50:04,980
Your sin.

5161
05:50:05,500 --> 05:50:05,940
Cleanse.

5162
05:50:08,840 --> 05:50:09,920
Barloom never.

5163
05:50:10,080 --> 05:50:10,380
Yay!

5164
05:50:11,080 --> 05:50:13,140
All my sins have been forgiven.

5165
05:50:13,760 --> 05:50:14,480
Let's go.

5166
05:50:16,060 --> 05:50:16,500
Oh my god.

5167
05:50:16,660 --> 05:50:17,300
Where's the free?

5168
05:50:17,760 --> 05:50:18,680
The free chair.

5169
05:50:21,080 --> 05:50:21,840
See you guys?

5170
05:50:22,300 --> 05:50:23,500
Committing murder is okay.

5171
05:50:23,600 --> 05:50:25,560
As long as you confess your pure sins.

5172
05:50:26,420 --> 05:50:27,800
That's the lesson I learned.

5173
05:50:29,880 --> 05:50:30,300
In game.

5174
05:50:30,580 --> 05:50:31,020
In-game!

5175
05:50:31,240 --> 05:50:31,820

5176
05:50:31,960 --> 05:50:33,040
In Silk Song!

5177
05:50:33,180 --> 05:50:35,060
For legal reasons, in Silk Song!

5178
05:50:37,180 --> 05:50:38,440
Okay, that's it.

5179
05:50:46,620 --> 05:50:47,500
Alright, here.

05:50:48,220 --> 05:50:49,100
