1
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,850
Okay, I hope I'm not jump-messing.

2
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,330
It says check in now!

3
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,610
Okay, go to tournament.

4
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,250
How do I check in?

5
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,410
Oh, you're checked in.

6
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:41,990
I'm checked in.

7
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,770
Don't worry guys, I'm so checked in.

8
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,750
Why is this overlooking my messages?

9
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,730
Why is this gigantic?

10
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,430
I have no idea.

11
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,070
Too much avatars are so big.

12
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,590
Alright, I'm warming up guys.

13
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,070
I'm warming up.

14
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,730
I'm doing the thing.

15
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,830
We're starting on Storm Point.

16
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,190
Hey look!

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,030
My trio matches in Storm Point as well!

18
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:04,610
Oh.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,700
Okay, I checked in.

20
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,660
I'm checked in as well.

21
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,220
Oh, I... I...

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,200
It says I'm checked in.

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,080
I don't know.

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,940
Do I have to check in too?

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,560
I don't know what my email is and stuff.

26
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,060
Oh, okay.

27
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,520
No, you don't have to check in.

28
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,800
It's fine.

29
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,460
Oh, thank god.

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,140
When one person checks in, it checks everyone in.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,020
Oh, thank god.

32
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,840
We're learning.

33
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,160
So they'll give us code in five minutes.

34
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,680
Okay.

35
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,700
Nah.

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,320
Nice.

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,500
W.

38
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,540
Alright, I'll be right back real quick.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:36,860
One sec.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,420
Alright, I'm warming up.

41
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,640
My chat's not gonna see this until ten minutes later.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,660
Alright guys, this...

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,040
Are you gonna use the bathroom?

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,260
Wait, wait.

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,940
If we're Storm Point, am I still Caustic or am I Watson?

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,600
I don't... I don't know, man.

47
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,080
I don't even know what I'm playing.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,160
This is something we needed to figure out earlier.

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,600
No.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,880
We can figure it out as we go.

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,720
I'll be right back.

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,060
Okay.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,780
Even though, what am I?

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,380
I don't even know what I am.

55
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,200
Alright, does this open up my game?

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,960
Those fucker people.

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,260
So now... let's...

58
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,060
Oh, fuck.

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,060
Oh, I did.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,300
Oh, I'm still wearing my fucking...

61
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,080
I forgot to adjust my stuff.

62
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,400
I forgot to turn off my karaoke stuff.

63
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,040
I forgot to turn off my karaoke stuff.

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,840
I was like, wait a minute, what am I... I'm so tired from it, that's for sure.

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,780
I hope my guy dies so I can...

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,060
I need to turn off a lot of my karaoke stuff.

67
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,220
Okay, off, off...

68
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,260
My guy's still alive?

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,480
Bro, what the fuck?

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh my god, he's rezzing me?

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,820
Bro, what the fuck?

72
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,680
Bro...

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,560
Oh my... he fucking lives?!

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,420
And he wins?!

75
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,940
Bro, I'm not... I was not ready for this.

76
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,220
I'm in a trio game.

77
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm in a fucking trio to warm up.

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,040
My guy actually won the fight, I was trying to...

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,540
Literally the worst timing when my landlord mentioned to me about rent.

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,120
And something happened to my account.

81
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,320
Literally the worst timing ever.

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,260
Oh no.

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,700
Oh no.

84
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,040
Apparently they didn't get my fucking payments for rent, dude.

85
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,460
Like, what?

86
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:42,940
What?

87
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,780
I don't understand.

88
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,700
Are they gonna kick you out?

89
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,380
I hope so.

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,600
I fucking hate this place anyway.

91
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,780
How long have you been living there?

92
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,000
Almost two years.

93
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,120
I'm done renting out for this year.

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,100
I'm 100% buying somewhere.

95
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,780
Oh shit.

96
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,240
Landlords are fucking scams.

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,200
You are not an entrepreneur.

98
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,500
You're a scammer.

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,500
You're all scammers.

100
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,680
Does he know your stream?

101
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,220
I don't fucking know.

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,600
Probably.

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,060
I live in a big ass building, bro.

104
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,820
It's a multi-billion dollar corporation, of course.

105
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,080
The ones that scam you the hardest.

106
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,980
You don't become a billionaire without fucking scamming.

107
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,980
Oh yeah, yeah.

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,420
Like the corp... you're renting from a company, right?

109
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:18,700
Oh yeah.

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,880
I'm writing the fattest Yelp review about this place, bro, when I leave.

111
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,720
I'm airing this bitch out on Twitter and everything.

112
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,640
This place fucking sucks.

113
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,040
Alright, where do you live?

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,600
Where do you live?

115
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,780
Where do you live?

116
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,180
Where do you live?

117
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,840
Tell it to everybody.

118
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,420
Where do you live?

119
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,100
Where do you live?

120
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,720
Where do you live, Jack?

121
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,120
Where do you live?

122
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,380
On stream right now.

123
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,460
On two... on three different streams.

124
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,200
Where do you live?

125
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,700
I'm fucking weak.

126
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,320
What is your apartment number, Jack?

127
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,880
Yeah, what is it?

128
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,700
Well, now you're... oh wait, we know your first name.

129
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,700
We'll just find the...

130
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,640
Why is my camera... my camera's been black and white this whole time.

131
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,160
Ten minutes later.

132
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,940
Ten minutes later I see why my camera's black and white.

133
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,840
What the fuck?

134
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,160
Oh, it's because I clicked video call by accident.

135
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,980
Oh, chat, well you just got a really interesting version of me for a little bit.

136
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,280
That was dope.

137
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,080
Hell yeah.

138
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,460
That was fire.

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,420
Alright, cool.

140
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,740
Oh my gosh, why did my guy have to win this fight?

141
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,380
I wanted to queue up for the next game.

142
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,380
I will never ever ever be paying rent ever again after this year.

143
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,960
I fucking hate it.

144
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,040
Yeah, but then you're gonna have a mortgage.

145
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,020
I would rather pay a mortgage every day of the week.

146
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,240
To be fair, mortgages are actually good for you.

147
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:23,780
Yeah.

148
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,180
For your credit.

149
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,660
Oh yeah.

150
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,660
But not like too bad of a mor... if you don't get a too bad of a mortgage.

151
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,300
Yeah.

152
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,100
The more you pay off your credit...

153
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,400
Sorry.

154
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,360
Your mortgage, the more... the better credit you get.

155
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,880
Yeah, 100%.

156
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,540
Because it says you're a responsible homeowner.

157
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,920
Responsible.

158
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,560
Apparently there's an earthquake in LA.

159
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,240
I didn't feel anything.

160
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,220
There was?

161
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,460
Apparently.

162
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,800
The earth is dying.

163
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,000
Where my friend lives.

164
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,500
Honestly.

165
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,000
This is why you need to live... like... like you need to live away from the ocean.

166
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,080
So you don't have to worry about the water sucking up the land.

167
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,480
What if there was an earthquake?

168
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,780
Yeah, live in a landlocked city.

169
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
Oh, New York City.

170
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:10,980
Seriously.

171
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,220
Is the code out yet?

172
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,240
You're always asking if the code is out.

173
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,180
I'm freaking out.

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
I'm freaking out.

175
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,360
Is the code out?

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,720
When does my fucking stream... cause it says go live.

177
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,980
I'm waiting for the fucking stream.

178
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,940
No, I'm waiting for the YouTube thing to be like go live.

179
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,380
Oh my god.

180
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,020
10 minutes is so long.

181
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,820
10 minutes is actually so long.

182
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,360
It's such a long delay.

183
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,000
Who the fuck is... I guess it's cause like you know...

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,260
Cheater mans.

185
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,200
Hacker mans.

186
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,200
Cause it's like that's how long... it's like too into the game that at that point...

187
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,540
They can't do anything.

188
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:56,960
That's true.

189
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,140
They can't do anything.

190
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,300
I'm gonna go stream tonight.

191
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,220
But it's still pretty fucking long.

192
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,780
I'm so locked in.

193
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,140
I need you to like micromanage what upgrades to get.

194
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,920
If it's a character I don't know what...

195
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,780
It says ping an item please.

196
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,920
What the fuck does that mean?

197
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,030
Bro, I'm multitasking here.

198
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,870
I can't ping shit for you.

199
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,650
My random teammate.

200
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,830
I'm so fucked dude.

201
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,810
I'm trying to fucking... I'm trying to figure out how to fucking stream.

202
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:46,530
Figure it out.

203
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,390
Figure it out.

204
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,770
I don't know but YouTube thing doesn't pop up and be like go live.

205
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,610
Wait does YouTube... can you add 10 minute delay to YouTube?

206
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,390
You have to be able to.

207
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,450
There's no way you can't.

208
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,850
No I have done in the past.

209
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,210
I just rarely added delays before but it's like...

210
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,250
Wait, what the fuck?

211
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,190
The option to go live isn't going live.

212
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,650
Oh wait wait guys I got good news.

213
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,770
And bad news.

214
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,930
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

215
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,690
What's the good news?

216
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,070
No what is the good news?

217
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,450
1, 2, 3, 4, okay good news is we have 15 teams in our lobby.

218
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,250
So I'm guessing a lot of people didn't click check in.

219
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,850
So they got removed from the tournament.

220
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,510
Oh!

221
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,150
Bad news is we have Zone Davis in our lobby.

222
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,670
Oh really?

223
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,130
That's good.

224
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,490
That's good.

225
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,690
Oh wait.

226
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,070
Okay so we just let Zone Davis kill everyone.

227
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:35,710
Exactly.

228
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,210
And we just kill.

229
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,250
Make sure we avoid him.

230
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,070
Okay does anyone know where he lands and scrims?

231
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,970
No idea.

232
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,970
No idea.

233
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,310
I need to ask the comments.

234
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,090
Look at his bots.

235
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,670
Look at his bots and see where he lands.

236
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,370
Good idea.

237
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,730
Yeah yeah yeah and then we just land the opposite side.

238
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,430
My code's not out yet though.

239
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,370
I'm still waiting for the admin to create the lobby.

240
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,530
We're so shocked.

241
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,970
Look at the bots.

242
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,350
Oh my god I can go live!

243
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,330
You can't do that.

244
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,250
She's alive!

245
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,490
She's alive!

246
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,610
I can go live now!

247
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,630
Fucking 10 minute delays man.

248
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,150
Zone.com.b.

249
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,150
D.

250
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,730
Davis.

251
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,250
Right.

252
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,230
Where does he land and scrims so we can avoid his ass?

253
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,790
Um.

254
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,270
Videos.

255
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,610
Oh my god my guy's killing everybody.

256
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,130
I'm just existing at this point.

257
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,790
Yo all his stream titles are smiley face.

258
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,890
How am I supposed to know where you land and scrims?

259
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,470
It's time to watch all his streams.

260
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,850
Did you put the code in the chat table?

261
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:33,650
Yeah.

262
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,810
I didn't yet but I will when it comes out.

263
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,410
Oh it's still not out bro?

264
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:37,890
What the fuck?

265
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,830
I'm tripping out bro.

266
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,990
I wanna get in this goddamn game.

267
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,550
I'm so ready.

268
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,650
I'm not.

269
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,570
I'm not gonna lie.

270
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,030
I'm not.

271
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,550
You're not ready?

272
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,090
I don't feel ready.

273
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,590
I shot my gun like once in this trio game and I have 77 damage.

274
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,170
Oh my god.

275
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,230
You're so fucked.

276
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,310
I'm not ready.

277
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,750
We're so fucked.

278
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,070
Don't worry.

279
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,470
Viewers won't find out until 10 minutes later.

280
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:16,590
Alright he lands checkpoint and uh... checkpoint and uh... fissure.

281
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,530
It looks like.

282
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,550
Fissure?

283
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,910
Okay so we just avoid that.

284
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,850
Yeah yeah.

285
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,490
Just go the opposite side of that.

286
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,290
Tango spotted.

287
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,390
Wait.

288
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,370
I just typed code in chat.

289
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,690
Oh it codes out?

290
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:30,750
Yeah.

291
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,770
But I need to warm up my charge rifle.

292
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,350
You do?

293
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,130
You really need to warm up your charge rifle?

294
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:38,750
Yeah.

295
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,520
Tell me when to join the lobby cause I'm still in this goddamn trios match.

296
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,320
I can't leave because this guy has tried so hard to carry me.

297
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,500
He knows you're a streamer.

298
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,120
He's like...

299
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,540
He's done so much for me.

300
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,080
Alright.

301
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,320
Codes out baby W.

302
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,720
Let's go tempo.

303
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,460
Thanks for the code.

304
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,160
Let's not get round one.

305
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,080
No no I mean bro I'm gonna be honest if we get round one I...

306
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,380
If we do that would be so funny though.

307
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,140
That would be funny in a very bad way.

308
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,080
That would be so funny.

309
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,220
Don't worry our viewers won't know.

310
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,060
What do you remember when you...

311
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,640
Just delete.

312
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,200
Oh right.

313
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,060
Uh...

314
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,400
Fifteen.

315
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,200
Say fifteen?

316
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:34,940
Yeah.

317
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,860
Oh my god bro my aim's not doing so well just so you know.

318
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,620
Honestly if we're being real we probably should have changed our names.

319
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,580
For the first like...

320
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,540
Yeah we should have changed our names.

321
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
So we don't get stream snaked?

322
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,020
So some people won't know which lobby we were in.

323
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,960
They would definitely throw our game for the content.

324
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,300
Motherfuckers.

325
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,680
I'd win.

326
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,260
Yeah they probably don't even stream so there's no point.

327
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,360
Yeah no they don't need a stream it's the satisfaction.

328
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,900
I'll use stream snipers I'm turning on the mode thing.

329
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,540
The mode that doesn't tell you who...

330
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,080
That doesn't tell me who killed me.

331
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,580
So none of you will get satisfaction.

332
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,880
None of you will get satisfaction.

333
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,680
No one can see it.

334
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,040
Alright my charge is up.

335
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,680
I'm ready to go.

336
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,160
Apparently you're so quiet while I figure this out 10 minutes later.

337
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,200
No I can't adjust the volume because I have to fucking fight.

338
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,160
Oh wait I'm gonna pull a map so I can figure out whatever.

339
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,780
Oh shit what the fuck.

340
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,960
What the fuck.

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,280
Weird.

342
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,500
Huh?

343
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,080
Hm.

344
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:54,520
Hm.

345
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,200
Oh my god oh my god nice wig oh my god oh my god high wig.

346
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,360
Yeah we're fucking shocked guys.

347
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,420
I blame wig it's all on his fault.

348
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,500
This is your fault wig.

349
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,400
If we get fucking landed on it's all wig's fault.

350
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,760
Alright wait wait wait let's just say where we're going.

351
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,380
Where are we going though?

352
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,640
Because actually we don't know what we're doing.

353
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,820
We haven't even discussed that at all.

354
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,720
I know.

355
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,060
I've been waiting for this discussion for a while.

356
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,220
What you mean you just woke up?

357
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,680
I've been asking I was like whoa where do we go guys?

358
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,500
Whoa.

359
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,260
Where do we play?

360
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,420
I've been asking this for a while.

361
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,260
Where are we going dude?

362
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,180
What's going on?

363
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,460
Um I mean where are we going?

364
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,060
Yeah that's a good question.

365
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,760
I mean...

366
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,340
I feel like...

367
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,400
I don't know.

368
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,740
I'm the only 15th team so.

369
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,320
Harvester would be pretty good for us.

370
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,740
Wait what do we what um what placement do we have to do?

371
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,700
To to like...

372
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,120
Top 10.

373
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,620
Top 10?

374
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,600
Okay we just need to be better than five teams.

375
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,140
That's it.

376
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,820
Top 10 all the way through.

377
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,280
So all we just need to be better than five teams.

378
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,940
Yeah which is really easy or should be.

379
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,650
Yeah there's already teams contesting each other so this is great.

380
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,750
This is good for us.

381
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,450
Alright yeah.

382
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,090

383
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,690

You know Harvester Snaps baked green pea snacks?

386
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:24,790
You ever heard of these?

387
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,730
A what snatch?

388
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,850
Baked green pea snacks.

389
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,230
What the fuck is that?

390
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,170
I'm so done I'm eating right now.

391
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,970

393
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,630
Oh I haven't even had lunch yet.

394
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,250
Okay guys this is...

395
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,830
You didn't even have breakfast.

396
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,750
I didn't even eat.

397
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,410
You didn't.

398
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:43,350
Yeah.

399
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,110
Why are your aims so bad?

400
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,370
Alright wait.

401
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,310
Alright.

402
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:48,790
Alright.

403
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,310
What's this?

404
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,310
Alright.

405
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,330
Harvester?

406
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,190
Harvester is not open.

407
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:55,990
Okay.

408
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,470
What is open?

409
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,810
In the middle or surprisingly Sky West Trials is still open.

410
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,750
I think we should go Sky West Trials.

411
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,090
Okay Sky West Trials and we can go if we want to go Sanger.

412
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:08,930
Actually...

413
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,970
Okay I want to be that guy.

414
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,730
We might struggle.

415
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,510
Sky West Trials.

416
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,270
Unless...

417
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,050
Unless what?

418
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,130
Unless what?

419
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,650
Oh no wait.

420
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,910
No wait.

421
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,050
Yeah we want to avoid...

422
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,650
Actually we want to avoid Fissure because that's where Davis lands.

423
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,330
So we...

424
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,390
Okay big mod stacks.

425
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,530
It is open.

426
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,110
We just need to avoid Fissure.

427
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,590
Let...

428
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,670
Let Davis's team kill everyone and we'll just keep collecting free stuff.

429
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,270
Just collect their boxes?

430
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:39,930
Yeah.

431
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,910
Collect their go next badge.

432
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,210
Yeah.

433
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,030
Alright wait.

434
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,410
We actually have to think about where we're going.

435
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,430
Wait I'm freaking out.

436
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:46,770
Okay.

437
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,170
I don't want to go landslide.

438
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:48,730
That's for sure.

439
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,570
Staging not really either.

440
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,410
What's taken?

441
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,890
What's taken?

442
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,390
Fissure, Staging, Harvester, Siphon, Tree, Geyser.

443
00:16:59,010 --> 00:16:59,690
That's taken.

444
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,390
Yeah.

445
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,270
And then Overlook and Epi Survey.

446
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:06,990
So...

447
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,770
So stacks is available?

448
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,090
Yeah.

449
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,590
Mod and stacks are still open.

450
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,970
We should take stacks I think.

451
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,550
Okay.

452
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,790
And then what about Storm Point?

453
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,110
Storm Point?

454
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,130
The middle POIs that are open are Aceto, Barometer, Pylon, and...

455
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,590
Oh.

456
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:21,890
Aceto.

457
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,530
Take Aceto.

458
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,470
I'm just happy to be here.

459
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,050
I'm going to say Aceto stacks.

460
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:25,730
Wait.

461
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:25,890
Wait.

462
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,030
Wait.

463
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,110
Um...

464
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,570
What?

465
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,830
Davis lands in checkpoint.

466
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,530
Uh Joakim, you feel like getting in the game today or tomorrow?

467
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:32,950
What are you thinking?

468
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:33,570
Wait.

469
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:33,850
What?

470
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,050
Do you want to get in the game any time soon or what's going on?

471
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:37,190
Wait.

472
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,730
Is the code out?

473
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,150
Oh.

474
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:38,810
Oh yeah.

475
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,070
Oh yeah.

476
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,730
I did it.

477
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,790
Hey guys.

478
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,690
I'm coming in.

479
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,530
We're going Aceto stacks then?

480
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,350
Yeah.

481
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,950
Great.

482
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:46,770
Awesome.

483
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,390
I'm locked in.

484
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,410
I'm locked in.

485
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,730
I'm locked in.

486
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,250
I'm locked in.

487
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,370
I'm locked in.

488
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:55,630
I'm locked in.

489
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:55,710
I'm locked in.

490
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:55,790
Oh, my gosh.

491
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,050
I didn't realize it was me.

492
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,990
I was just listening in.

493
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,110
I didn't realize that we were in.

494
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,410
Wait.

495
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,890
We're missing Team 10, too.

496
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:06,950
Yeah.

497
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,470
And two teams are missing.

498
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,870
Zone Davis is...

499
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,290
Bro, Zone Davis is going to fucking run at us, man.

500
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:13,990
We should...

501
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,030
Nevermind.

502
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,350
Zone Davis is full here.

503
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,270
Yeah.

504
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,370
Team 10 is down.

505
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,390
And team 3 is missing a player.

506
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,890
Is that Davis just gonna fucking run it at us?

507
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,230
New plan.

508
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,090
Land wherever we see a duo land.

509
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,950
Alright, so are we running?

510
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,990
Yeah, but what if they're landing where Zone Davis is next to?

511
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,410
Then we kill them and run away.

512
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,670
I think you're way too confident right now.

513
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

514
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,870
Let's do Cito and Stax.

515
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,850
Those guys should be free.

516
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,930
Alright, Cito and Stax.

517
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,010
I don't remember where either of these are.

518
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,370
Wait, uh, so should I...

519
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,490
I should go Wattson, right?

520
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,250
Cause they're on Stormflight.

521
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,790
And then Caustic on World's Edge.

522
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,110
Okay, but where do I go?

523
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,570
Yeah, I'm about to say, where do we go here?

524
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,250
Oh yeah, Wiggs on Blood.

525
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,690
Yeah, cause you're the roller.

526
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,110
We're starting.

527
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,090
I'm playing Blood both maps then?

528
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,910
You guys cool with that?

529
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,130
Yeah, okay, wait, what do I play?

530
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,850
I mean, on this map, best.

531
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,950
Okay, I'll do Bang.

532
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,250
Okay, you guys gotta like micromanage me here.

533
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,050
No, you're good, you're good.

534
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:20,570
I'll do my best.

535
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,350
I'm locked in, I'm locked in.

536
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,370
Yeah, you're gonna micromanage me.

537
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,270
I always turn my brain off when I rank.

538
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,930
I can't lie bro, no Valk though.

539
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,710
Make sure we just prioritize evac towers.

540
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,870
Literally just say something, like, immediately.

541
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,950
Like, get an evac, you're like, hey, got an evac.

542
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,730
It's gonna be a super important comm just because we don't have a Valk to get in anywhere.

543
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,750
Agreed.

544
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,410
Uh, how do we loot Cito?

545
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,850
Um, okay, so...

546
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,350
Cito Station, I think one should land on the bottom side near Jurassic.

547
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,850
One just lands in the middle and one goes big building on the right side.

548
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,350
It's pretty simple.

549
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,430
I mean, we could stretch Bean and just maybe see if someone's going Bean.

550
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,730
But I think we just don't get greedy here.

551
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,950
Oh my god, we have hot zone.

552
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,570
Yay!

553
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,850
Whoa, don't be too... we don't even know what we're gonna be landing on yet.

554
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,230
No one could have said anything and they can still land here.

555
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,450
We might be getting tested, just watch out.

556
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,430
Okay, so we just chill.

557
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,150
Yeah, so like, here's the play.

558
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:16,070
If we're gonna get tested, make sure we just group up together at some spot on Cito Station and go from there.

559
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:16,730
Yeah.

560
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,390
No one has dropped from this plane.

561
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,390
No.

562
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,950
There's like one team here.

563
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,330
I don't know, there's no one pylon.

564
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,510
I mean, to be fair, there's like 14 squads.

565
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,590
We just gotta be better than four squads!

566
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,190
This is it!

567
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,170
We gotta be better than four squads!

568
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,090
We gotta be better than four squads!

569
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:40,010
To be fair, announcing where we're going is actually probably worse for us just because the people wanted to land on us.

570
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,710
I know, that's why I was like, I don't know if we should talk about where...

571
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,770
I'll land on the bottom side.

572
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,990
We should have typed this out.

573
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,870
We should have typed this out.

574
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,910
We should have typed this out.

575
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,830
Yeah, you're good.

576
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,650
I'll land on the side.

577
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,090
Do your thing, you're good.

578
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,130
Alright, so I mean, whatever guns you guys want to take, feel free.

579
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,110
This first round shouldn't be that hard for us.

580
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:00,630
I got an evac!

581
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,250
Nice!

582
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:02,870
Good call!

583
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:03,870
Look at us!

584
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,570
We're doing so well!

585
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,630
Let's fucking go!

586
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,350
We're off to a better start than we ever thought.

587
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,770
Yeah, we got an evac on the first round.

588
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,150
First drop, let's fucking go!

589
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,910
This is better than Twitch Rivals!

590
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,650
Oh, that's way better than Twitch Rivals.

591
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,950
I think actually anything is better than Twitch Rivals.

592
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,510
Twitch Rivals never happen.

593
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,150
That was so painful.

594
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,150
How did we have zero beacons?

595
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,350
Oh, just like Twitch Rivals.

596
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,710
We had to fly somewhere else to get a beacon.

597
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

598
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,030
I mean, we could just...

599
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,910
This zone actually might be ending near us.

600
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,590
I think it's gonna be Barometer, but we can just stay here for right now and just play for the next zone.

601
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,970
I think we're just chillin' on Barometer side.

602
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,850
Or chill towards C-Diff time.

603
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,190
There's an R9 here in the Prowler.

604
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,430
There's also this here.

605
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,930
I haven't seen the Volt, but...

606
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,830
I have it, but I don't want the Volt.

607
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,290
Nah, you're good, you're good.

608
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,430
I'm actually gonna take this energy.

609
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:57,990
Oh, hey!

610
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,450
Volt, Volt, Volt!

611
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,590
Oh, nice, I'll take that over.

612
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,310
Am I trolling Tempo if I do that, you think?

613
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,630
Or what?

614
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,030
No.

615
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,790
No?

616
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,170
Okay.

617
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,790
There's a 6x here if you want.

618
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,030
When you get the Tri-Drival.

619
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,390
There's another Evac!

620
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,330
Guys!

621
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,650
I can take that one, nice.

622
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,470
I found a Volt too, nice.

623
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,490
Oh my god, there's so many Volts.

624
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,030
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

625
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,610
After I said that, I just found like so many.

626
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,250
Yeah, I found like two Volts.

627
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,930
Is there any Evo Caches that we can farm up on the way to?

628
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,030
I mean, she's gonna pull towards the outside side.

629
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,890
She's gonna be right side area.

630
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,410
So if we can get there quick and do one of those buildings, we're good to go.

631
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,290
I doubt we get sent on.

632
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,330
We might get sent on, but...

633
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,010
I'm gonna be honest, I'm pretty...

634
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,790
pretty confident in our 3v3 ability.

635
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,410
I think I'm on... We might not play it all the time, but I think we're better than the average player in these lobbies.

636
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,470
I think I'm on like 100 frames.

637
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,790
Oh no.

638
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,290
Performance...

639
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,550
Oh no.

640
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,710
No, no, no, no.

641
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,310
Okay, I...

642
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,830
No, we're okay.

643
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,830
I think we're okay.

644
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,010
Okay.

645
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,310
Are you sure we're okay?

646
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,190
I don't know.

647
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,490
This does not feel like 240 frames, but like...

648
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,110
Maybe it's my monotony.

649
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,490
We're good.

650
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,310
Alright, you guys ready to rip it out or what?

651
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,250
We're okay.

652
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,750
We're okay.

653
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,090
We're okay.

654
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,250
I'll play this one game on less frames.

655
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:10,710
It's fine.

656
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,490
Where was the other evac at, Dokie?

657
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:14,870
Where was it?

658
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,150
It was like in one of the buildings here.

659
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:17,790
Oh gosh.

660
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,930
We might be able to find it in one of the buildings.

661
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,750
Oh, okay.

662
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,530
I mean, we only need two.

663
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,690
We're not gonna need three to get into zone.

664
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:24,710
Should be fine.

665
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,230
I think I'd actually... I found it.

666
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,390
Okay.

667
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,670
No, just start ripping it in, I think.

668
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,250
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

669
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:28,690
Okay.

670
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,270
Then we just start the rotation in.

671
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:30,890
Let's go.

672
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,950
We're gonna rotate through the Jurassic side.

673
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,730
Go through here.

674
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,110
Charge rifle.

675
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:37,930
I'm good.

676
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,090
I'm good.

677
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,950
I got my hammer point recharged.

678
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:41,830
One team died!

679
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,350
One team died!

680
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,750
Don't forget, we already get a potion point just from being top 15.

681
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,770
Zone Davis, kill everyone!

682
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,830
Okay, but what if Zone Davis runs up at us?

683
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,690
Alright, we're gonna put my evac here.

684
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,430
We're gonna start rotating in.

685
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:54,970
Just gonna take my evac.

686
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,990
We're gonna get into barometer front side if we can.

687
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,150
I'll go first and I'll just tell you guys where to land with the ping.

688
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:00,570
Alright.

689
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,130
In case my landing's awful and I'll just tell you guys where to land.

690
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,670
Do we wanna try and get that?

691
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,450
What, the evo cache?

692
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,030
Yeah.

693
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:07,850
We probably should.

694
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,930
What, you good?

695
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,270
Hello?

696
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,910
I'm okay, I'm okay.

697
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,470
I ran into a tree.

698
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,230
I'm okay, I'm okay.

699
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,350
I ran into a tree.

700
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,290
Do I get the tactical cooldown or the ultimate cooldown?

701
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,390
That's up to you.

702
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,690
I mean, I would probably say...

703
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,170
I'd probably say tactical cooldown, personally.

704
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:24,470
I'd probably say tactical cooldown, personally.

705
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,990
But it's up to you.

706
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,850
I got the tactical cooldown.

707
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,610
Just because I don't think we're gonna use the ulti that much here.

708
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,190
I got my ulti here too.

709
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,070
We can just keep my ulti in.

710
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,070
I wanna... I guarantee those two buildings are gonna be taken here.

711
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,770
I would wanna get there, but I think both are gonna be taken for sure.

712
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,810
Is anyone top barometer?

713
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,570
No, I don't think anyone looted barometer.

714
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,950
They just took barometer right now.

715
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,530
They missed the top.

716
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,650
Wait, wait, you wanna put your evac down too?

717
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,090
Can you come here?

718
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,310
Put your evac down?

719
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,090
Yep.

720
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,350
Oh, they just took it from us.

721
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,130
You're good though.

722
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,990
There's no one in this left side building either.

723
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,130
We can land in the left side building.

724
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,130
We're gonna land for this left building, okay guys?

725
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,470
And we're gonna start immediately.

726
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,370
Yeah, yeah, gotcha, gotcha.

727
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,250
There's no one on the right.

728
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,790
So we should be free.

729
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,990
Let's just make sure that we're free.

730
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,690
Okay, we're good.

731
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,490
There's no way to hit those, right?

732
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,870
We're good.

733
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,170
Yeah, no one in here and we're good to go.

734
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,370
Yeah, we live here now.

735
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,170
Don't put Jen down yet, cause there's no one across from my scan.

736
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:18,830
We're gonna go there.

737
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,310
There's no one there.

738
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,470
I think we should take the... eh, no, let's just stay here.

739
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,290
You can start setting up, but we're good to go.

740
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:25,950
Let's go, baby.

741
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:26,710
Look at us.

742
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,610
We just gotta make sure we live.

743
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:29,710
We live.

744
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,350
Jen down could be like up on stairs, right?

745
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,110
Like here, could be over... I don't know.

746
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,050
You can put it anywhere you want.

747
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,410
Honestly.

748
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,970
There's nothing that's really safe.

749
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,410
I'm gonna look west side.

750
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,510
I'm looking at west side.

751
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:41,430
Okay.

752
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,210
Yeah, do your thing.

753
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:44,730
We should be fine.

754
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,750
I don't think a lot of teams are gonna rotate.

755
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,950
There's like a team up top here.

756
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,210
Yeah, they're gonna be top barometer, right?

757
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:50,450
Yeah.

758
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,630
They're up here.

759
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,490
Oh, what the fuck?

760
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,410
You can see me from here?

761
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,010
That's not fair.

762
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,270
We have a lot of Watson gens, so we should be fine on the passive healing too.

763
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,610
Watson still has her passive healing, right Temba?

764
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,130
I swear.

765
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,650
That's Davis.

766
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,350
I swear to God.

767
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,390
It might be, to be honest.

768
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,270
I feel like they're gonna play more aggressive because they just know they're better than a lot of people here.

769
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,790
Yeah.

770
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,050
I mean, one team's already gone, so I'm pretty sure.

771
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:12,230
Yeah.

772
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,930
Dragon also said he'll coach us if we need help.

773
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,630
So...

774
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,250
Nice.

775
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,970
That's actually huge for us.

776
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,670
Yeah, I wanted to go to the other building, but I feel like I might just pull to the nutsack.

777
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,430
And I feel like I'd be better.

778
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,830
So, I would just stay here.

779
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,470
Alright.

780
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,010
Well, no.

781
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,250
We're gonna go to the other building.

782
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,510
Oh!

783
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,390
That has to be Davis.

784
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:31,870
Let's go!

785
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,530
That has to be Davis.

786
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,170
One Bloodhound just killed two people.

787
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,370
Two more teams, guys!

788
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,770
Let's fucking go, guys!

789
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,490
I need to shoot someone.

790
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,830
Temba, is it three?

791
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,630
Is it three games or four?

792
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,910
Four, four, four.

793
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,950
It's four rounds?

794
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,130
Or like four... wait.

795
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,550
Four games per round.

796
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,730
Four games per round, three rounds.

797
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,230
Okay.

798
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,630
Four games is not too bad.

799
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,730
I thought it would be like six games.

800
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:57,930
No.

801
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,050
I want to shoot someone.

802
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,670
No one's rotating us down.

803
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,190
There's people above us.

804
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,750
If you want to shoot them, there's people on that side.

805
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,690
If you want to shoot that.

806
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,150
There's just no one here to shoot.

807
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,110
No one's gonna rotate.

808
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,090
This first round is usually pointless, to be honest.

809
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:16,650
Yeah.

810
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,510
I mean, we can have...

811
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,550
Oh!

812
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,330
Does that mean I can like fix my frames right now?

813
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:20,650
No.

814
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,190
Of course.

815
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:21,430
Yeah.

816
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:21,750
Okay.

817
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,550
If we die, it's not my fault.

818
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,690
I just said I could fix my...

819
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,210
Okay.

820
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:26,850
Should I look...

821
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,390
Where are you on?

822
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,170
Tempo, are you on the roof?

823
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,630
Oh, you're in the hole, right?

824
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,290
Never mind.

825
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,930
Tempo, if you go on that goddamn roof, I swear...

826
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,950
Tempo, you're literally Watson right now.

827
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:35,650
I forgot.

828
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,230
I forgot I did that with Drops.

829
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:37,790
Okay.

830
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,150
Okay.

831
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,410
Can I tap out?

832
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,290
No.

833
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:41,450
Yes.

834
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,030
You're so good.

835
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,470
You're so good.

836
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:42,850
Okay.

837
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,330
Even if he goes hit, no one's gonna send us.

838
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,390
What do you mean?

839
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,390
What if it was Zone Davis?

840
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,530
Even if I get knocked, I don't think we get fought.

841
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,350
To be honest.

842
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,290
Someone's fighting somewhere.

843
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,950
I can't see, cause...

844
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,370
Alright, I'm gonna...

845
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,510
I'm gonna fucking double check my monitor.

846
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,170
Just to be sure.

847
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,670
Oh my god.

848
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,090
How do I tap to my...

849
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,410
You guys, I need to figure out how to get my...

850
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,770
Oh my god, we're almost dead.

851
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,730
Wait, what?

852
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,130
No, we're good.

853
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,730
Why are you sitting on a roof?

854
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,390
I'm not, I was first floor.

855
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,270
Okay, no, I'm on 280 hertz.

856
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,970
My eyes might just be tired.

857
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,730
Are you fucking kidding me?

858
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,650
My eyes are seeing 100 FPS.

859
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,730
There is no...

860
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,370
I'm taking away.

861
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,350
I still have eye boogers.

862
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,150
My eyes might just be tired.

863
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:32,710
It's okay.

864
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,290
I'm on 200 frames.

865
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:34,970
One of the craziest.

866
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,710
Sorry, my 200...

867
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,590
280 hertz is so many fucking frames.

868
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,590
You thought you were on 100?

869
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,350
My eyes just haven't booted up yet.

870
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,430
It's okay now.

871
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,250
It's okay.

872
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,790
How old are you, 98?

873
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,250
Guys, I'm hungry.

874
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,430
I'm hungry too.

875
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,990
The poor girl is EP and hungry, guys.

876
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,310
EP and hungry.

877
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,010
That is why...

878
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,270
Wait, where?

879
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,670
Over on...

880
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,550
He wants to know where you got shot at.

881
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,570
I got shot from...

882
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,730
Oh my god.

883
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,890
He knows where he got shot at.

884
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,750
You guys are giving a purpose.

885
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,650
The hell no.

886
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,330
They would need so much damage to get purple.

887
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:25,890
It's insane.

888
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,570
I would just keep putting your gen down too on cooldown too, TempoVAdam.

889
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,210
You motherfuckers using charge rifle because I'm in the lobby?

890
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,270
No, Tempo.

891
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,850
No, other people also use this charge rifle.

892
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,050
Yeah, I love you so much, but that's definitely not the case.

893
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,670
No one uses charge rifle.

894
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,510
No one uses charge rifle.

895
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,750
It's not just you.

896
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,050
I'm gonna use these cells because I want to get this pack.

897
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,310
Wait, someone's landing.

898
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,150
Yeah, just hold strong.

899
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,910
They're going to the other building.

900
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,370
I kinda want to get this pack, bro.

901
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,250
Am I trolling if I do that?

902
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,230
I think I probably am trolling.

903
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,550
We're in this building.

904
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,810
Yo, stay still so I can charge my party.

905
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,770
Should I risk it for this pack and maybe die or no?

906
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,450
What pack?

907
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,830
Right here, care package.

908
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,630
No, because the team above is gonna fucking kill you.

909
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,870
I can smoke it.

910
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,770
Yeah, I want a smoke up top for me.

911
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,050
Oh, okay.

912
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,070
I'll smoke up top too.

913
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,290
I smoked it.

914
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,070
I'm going to die from this one guy.

915
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,870
I need to wait for your next smoke.

916
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,810
I forgot to drop my weapon.

917
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,170
Oh my god, my next smoke is gonna be in like 19 seconds.

918
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,710
No one's gonna get it anyway, bro.

919
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,090
They're baby-dog bitches.

920
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,750
They're good.

921
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,370
Yeah, but now I have to wait for my next two smokes.

922
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,530
That's fine.

923
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,990
Smoke double height.

924
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,430
Okay.

925
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,910
You gotta have to bet on the fact that if I hit it or not.

926
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,150
You'll miss one?

927
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,510
Yeah, you're gonna miss one for sure.

928
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,730
Oh, they smoked it.

929
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,110
They got it.

930
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,350
I told you.

931
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,570
And they got a Kraber knock.

932
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,750
How are you not?

933
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,510
You were fucking... you're not locked in.

934
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,330
I did my smokes.

935
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,490
I did my smokes, man.

936
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,910
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

937
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,150
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

938
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,630
How are you not locked in, bro?

939
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,790
How are you not locked in, bro?

940
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,250
My apologies.

941
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,750
I headbunked him.

942
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,510
Only 10 more shots and then I have...

943
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,830
Alright, this guy has a Kraber now.

944
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,630
So like, just be...

945
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,030
We got knocked here.

946
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,510
It's actually bad.

947
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,950
Look at that sound pool, by the way.

948
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:17,730
It pulls back to barometer.

949
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,010
So we got to bamboozle a little bit.

950
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,890
A tad bit bamboozled.

951
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,290
Alright.

952
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,390
There's no one in this house, though.

953
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,270
We could just...

954
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:25,990
Which house?

955
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,430
This house?

956
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,110
What if it pulls back?

957
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,350
Yeah, I don't know.

958
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,470
They would just stay where that sound show goes.

959
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,710
We always make rotates to be underneath middle of barometer if we need to.

960
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,550
Team 9.

961
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,530
Yeah, that's right.

962
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,870
Yeah, somebody got eliminated by the ring.

963
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,310
Yeah, motherfuckers.

964
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,550
Yeah.

965
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,150
One more squad and we're top 10.

966
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,310
We could just...

967
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,710
If we get top 10 consistently every game, we're top 10.

968
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,470
We should be top 10, right?

969
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:48,590
Yeah.

970
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,110
Implacement.

971
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,490
Yeah.

972
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,070
There's no way.

973
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,390
There's new placements.

974
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,170
I love...

975
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,610
Guys, this is the...

976
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,010
I love ALGS so much.

977
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,150
It's so easy.

978
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,010
Alright.

979
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,490
That means like round 2 and 3, like people actually...

980
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,850
It's gonna be a full lobby, right?

981
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,670
Cause like...

982
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

983
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,610
They made it to the full lobby.

984
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,730
I hope like...

985
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,990
I hope like our lobby is filled with like...

986
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,830
I know they're building and shooting us by the way.

987
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,510
I don't know, guys.

988
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,350
I hope like our lobby first...

989
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,490
If we make it to second round is filled with like...

990
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,090
Teenagers.

991
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,270
So like their parents will be like...

992
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,010
Will be like, get off the PC.

993
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,770
Oh, yeah?

994
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,650
Just kick them out?

995
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,410
Yeah, yeah.

996
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,130
They'll be like...

997
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,710
Like, mom, I'm in a tournament.

998
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,750
Like, it doesn't matter.

999
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,650
You gotta...

1000
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,090
You gotta go do some... Get the fuck off.

1001
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,350
Yeah, yeah.

1002
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,230
Get the fuck off.

1003
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,310
It's my turn on the PC.

1004
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,030
You got calculus homework.

1005
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,530
Yeah, you got homework to do.

1006
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,630
Fucking nerd.

1007
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,430
It's past your bedtime.

1008
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,990
Yeah.

1009
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,090
Tembo, take my armor and passively charge this up, please.

1010
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,430
Can you do that, actually?

1011
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,530
Can you do that anymore with the evo charters?

1012
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,970
No, you can't.

1013
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:00,630
Cringe, dude.

1014
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,730
Cringe, cringe, cringe.

1015
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,370
Oh, wait.

1016
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,350
Should I throw another one down?

1017
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,510
Yeah, why not right now?

1018
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,350
Do we wait until the next... until the...

1019
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,170
Oh, yeah.

1020
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,850
Wait until zone pops.

1021
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,230
Wait until zone pops.

1022
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,350
Team going underneath bridge, by the way.

1023
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,350
That's an ass team.

1024
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,370
That is probably zone Davis.

1025
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,330
Nah, it's a blue armor.

1026
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,050
There's no way it's zone Davis.

1027
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,290
Yeah, there's no way.

1028
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,160
Oh, I almost pegged him in the head.

1029
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,880
Your big ass is in my way.

1030
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,740
Sorry.

1031
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,760
I get that a lot, actually.

1032
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,100
Damn.

1033
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,540
Wait, we should take bottom and middle barometer right now.

1034
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,080
I'm gonna scan it.

1035
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:35,880
One sec.

1036
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,300
I'm gonna scan it.

1037
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,780
Make sure we can go.

1038
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,380
Alright, I gotta grab... There's no first floor.

1039
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:40,780
Are you guys ready?

1040
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,460
Can you smoke height?

1041
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,120
We going down below?

1042
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,620
Yep.

1043
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,540
Alright, go, go, go.

1044
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,020
I double smoked.

1045
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,160
Nice.

1046
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,360
Good double smoke, Skis.

1047
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,160
I double smoked but still got hit.

1048
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,840
I might be dead.

1049
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,160
Okay.

1050
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,220
How are you getting hit?

1051
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,000
That is incredibly easy.

1052
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,020
I'm holding for you.

1053
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,380
You're chilling?

1054
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,020
Yeah, I'm fine.

1055
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,360
I'm fine.

1056
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:55,880
I'll be here.

1057
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,160
Yeah, you're good.

1058
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,340
You're good.

1059
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,680
I have no idea where I got shot.

1060
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,400
I was too scared.

1061
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,820
I didn't want to look at it.

1062
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,160
I have to go.

1063
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,040
Just fence up everywhere, bro.

1064
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,580
And gen everywhere.

1065
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,720
Well, gen one place, but you know what I mean.

1066
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,480
I'll lock this door up just in case somebody shows up here.

1067
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,460
That's fine.

1068
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
I'll push up here.

1069
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,460
Just until the fences show up.

1070
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,880
Yeah, and get some fences in the zip line room so you can jump down.

1071
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,340
Yeah.

1072
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,720
You're good, buddy.

1073
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,220
Take your time.

1074
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,360
You're vibing.

1075
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
It seems to be on bridge.

1076
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,500
Bridge is still in too.

1077
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,080
10 squads.

1078
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm trying to think of what we're going to do after this.

1079
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,660
Is that a care pack?

1080
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,260
Okay, we already got top 10.

1081
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,720
It's fine.

1082
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,600
Honestly, we're doing pretty good.

1083
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,800
Yeah, we're doing pretty well.

1084
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,560
I would love to hit a shot right now and then maybe get a kill, but you know.

1085
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,640
Do we really need a kill though?

1086
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,580
No, probably not.

1087
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,240
Yes, no.

1088
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:48,980
We need to stay alive.

1089
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,000
5206 and the 9304.

1090
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,500
Oh, triple red squad fighting in the back.

1091
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:53,940
We know that.

1092
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,940
That's zone Davis.

1093
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,600
That's great.

1094
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,180
It's huge trust.

1095
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,440
That's awesome.

1096
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,840
I'm going to keep pulling back then.

1097
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,300
That's Davis right there.

1098
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,600
That's the most risky play you guys are seeing.

1099
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,560
I just made a fucking battery in this crafter.

1100
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,360
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

1101
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:07,660
Let's go.

1102
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,060
Damn.

1103
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,960
You're gaming right now.

1104
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,580
Oh, yeah.

1105
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,060
I'm actually streaming.

1106
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,300
Oh my god.

1107
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,160
Non-squads, let's go.

1108
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,600
Let's go, guys.

1109
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,660
Let's go, guys.

1110
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,740
Oh my god.

1111
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,360
Most fucking...

1112
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,140
hate round ever.

1113
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,340
What are they doing?

1114
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:24,880
Oh my god.

1115
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,560
That was a horrible play.

1116
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:25,860
Nice.

1117
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,000
Glad we're not those guys.

1118
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,980
Wait, what the fuck?

1119
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,900
Who are these bloodhounds?

1120
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,020
I've never seen those names before.

1121
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,560
Thank god.

1122
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,480
Those guys are fucking...

1123
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,520
I'm going to lock out this door.

1124
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,620
See if I can shoot anyone.

1125
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,920
I'm not going to fucking risk anything right now.

1126
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,040
No, you're good.

1127
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,420
I'm just going to let it keep going forward and see if I can get any KP for us.

1128
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Ooh.

1129
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,680
Any points.

1130
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm seeing anybody who's rotating in from behind.

1131
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,300
Yeah, we're good right now.

1132
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,800
Wait, there's a team right behind us.

1133
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,240
They're not on my door.

1134
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,460
Yeah, they're on my door.

1135
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,960
Yeah, they are.

1136
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,720
They're going through the house.

1137
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,720
Do they want to fight us right now?

1138
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,540
I don't know.

1139
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,940
They're like running back and forth.

1140
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,060
There's like a guy on the stairs here and a guy to our right.

1141
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,620
I'm trying to look.

1142
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:04,940
I'm going to scan.

1143
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,360
It's a whole three man.

1144
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:06,920
Yeah, a whole three man.

1145
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,320
Watch out.

1146
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,420
They're going to get me.

1147
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,500
Look at this way, south way.

1148
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,700
It's a tree man.

1149
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,240
Yeah, do you have any grenades here?

1150
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,680
Yeah, I do.

1151
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,980
I already burned one of them.

1152
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,880
I'm burning someone on purple.

1153
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,060
Yeah, I'm burning people.

1154
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,060
There goes the other door.

1155
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,600
It's so weird.

1156
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,060
What are they doing?

1157
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,820
One is on the stairs there.

1158
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,200
I'm going to ult you.

1159
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,080
We're in a third party though.

1160
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,580
So dumb.

1161
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,600
Almost one killed one.

1162
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,040
137.

1163
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,600
I'm looking for you.

1164
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,060
I'm covering.

1165
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,400
I'm covering.

1166
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,540
I'm going to go back there soon.

1167
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,260
I don't know what they're doing.

1168
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,980
I don't know why they want to fight us.

1169
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,300
I don't make any sense here.

1170
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,040
This fight makes no sense.

1171
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:44,880
Hold on.

1172
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,300
I can now too.

1173
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,060
I'm batting.

1174
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,760
I'm batting.

1175
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,180
Peeking, peeking, peeking.

1176
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,460
Nice.

1177
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,200
Good job.

1178
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,340
Batting, batting.

1179
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,160
They're dying.

1180
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,800
They're dying from what's up now.

1181
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,800
Okay, that's good.

1182
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm batting.

1183
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,060
How are the other guys in the house not shooting these kids?

1184
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:58,940
What the fuck?

1185
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,880
What is this green mean?

1186
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,980
We're going to walk in 10 seconds.

1187
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,860
We're going to have to walk forward here.

1188
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,880
Stay healthy right now.

1189
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,480
We're going to move forward here.

1190
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,260
I'm staying healthy.

1191
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,900
I have no ulti now.

1192
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,420
This is so ass.

1193
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,080
What are these kids doing?

1194
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,980
I have an ult.

1195
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,800
Do you want me to ult somewhere?

1196
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,020
They ran already.

1197
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,160
They ran the fucking way with their ult.

1198
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,480
What are they doing?

1199
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,460
She won this.

1200
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,740
She won this.

1201
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:17,940
Okay.

1202
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,620
Okay.

1203
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,360
I'm going to go.

1204
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,040
What are these fucking idiots doing?

1205
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,440
You're good.

1206
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:23,640
You're good.

1207
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,240
Just look left and try to get your KP.

1208
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,960
Just get your full heal up.

1209
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,720
Nice.

1210
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,240
They're dying right now.

1211
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,700
Just go.

1212
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,140
Yeah.

1213
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:30,720
I'm here.

1214
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:30,960
I'm here.

1215
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:31,700
Yeah.

1216
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,360
Kill this last guy.

1217
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:32,580
Kill this last guy.

1218
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:32,880
Kill this last guy.

1219
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:34,620
Good armor.

1220
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,300
I cracked him.

1221
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:35,680
I cracked him.

1222
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,820
It's the last one.

1223
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,400
If you can get him.

1224
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,060
Yeah.

1225
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,520
Take that.

1226
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:38,780
Take that.

1227
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,820
100% you go for that kill.

1228
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,760
Oh shit.

1229
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,840
I thought that was Fuse.

1230
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,600
I tried to get through.

1231
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,780
Nice guys.

1232
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,900
Now move up to the left side.

1233
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,400
Just keep playing left.

1234
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,100
Keep playing more left, Teppo.

1235
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,460
More left.

1236
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,740
More left.

1237
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,500
You're good.

1238
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:49,760
You're good.

1239
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,080
Nice guys.

1240
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,560
Good shit.

1241
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,300
Put your gen down too.

1242
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:52,500
Yeah.

1243
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:52,840
I have one, Teppo.

1244
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,600
Do you have gen?

1245
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,820
I'm going to ult left.

1246
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,620
Just because I...

1247
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,720
Get ulti.

1248
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:58,920
Get ulti.

1249
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:58,940
Get ulti.

1250
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,140
Wait.

1251
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,580
Behind us.

1252
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,620
What the fuck?

1253
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,180
There's a guy behind us.

1254
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,040
You're good, Teppo.

1255
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,420
Play it right.

1256
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:03,660
Play it right.

1257
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:03,960
Just leave.

1258
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,280
Just leave.

1259
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,420
Just leave.

1260
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Teppo.

1261
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,360
Did you live?

1262
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:06,940
You lived.

1263
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,300
Yes.

1264
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,800
You're good.

1265
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,160
Stay there.

1266
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,780
Stay there.

1267
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,280
Just stay there.

1268
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,600
Don't move.

1269
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,080
Top 5, baby.

1270
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,240
Top 5.

1271
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,520
Just stay there.

1272
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:15,920
Don't look.

1273
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,720
Don't look at them.

1274
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,620
Don't even look.

1275
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,420
Yeah.

1276
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,760
They won't see if we don't move.

1277
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,360
I thought that worked.

1278
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:20,760
Yeah.

1279
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,900
It's like the dinosaurs.

1280
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,720
Oh.

1281
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:22,960
Oh.

1282
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,240
Oh.

1283
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,400
Oh.

1284
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,800
Oh.

1285
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,200
Maybe Clash of the... Whoa.

1286
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,660
Whoa.

1287
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,200
Whoa.

1288
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,440
Whoa.

1289
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:28,680
Whoa.

1290
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:28,740
Whoa.

1291
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,400
That is like...

1292
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,100
And we got top 4.

1293
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Yeah.

1294
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,420
We got a few kills.

1295
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,440
Nice job, guys.

1296
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,080
Let's go.

1297
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,000
We got the kills.

1298
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,600
We got 4 kills.

1299
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,160
That's right.

1300
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,300
Suck a dick.

1301
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,860
Whoever Bangor 2942 is.

1302
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,320
Yeah.

1303
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,060
Whoever you are.

1304
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,380
Good plays, man.

1305
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,020
That's... I mean, that's probably enough for us to qualify already.

1306
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,300
Yeah.

1307
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,220
I think we're fine.

1308
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,020
We can just chill now.

1309
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:53,880
Yeah.

1310
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,200
We're good.

1311
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,500
I'll play.

1312
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,120
I'll play next game.

1313
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,780
That's nice.

1314
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,560
We're good.

1315
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,660
That was awesome, bro.

1316
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:58,960
Good spit.

1317
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,560
Are you doing it?

1318
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,000
Good job getting the KP.

1319
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,980
We needed that pretty much.

1320
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,740
We did it, guys.

1321
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,460
We got 4 kills.

1322
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,160
KP, guys!

1323
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,420
And 4th place!

1324
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,380
Is there any team that's gonna chase us?

1325
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:08,920
now?

1326
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,140
Oh my God.

1327
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,160
This is the Kraber team.

1328
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,800
Let's do it.

1329
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,540
That could've been us.

1330
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,920
That Bloodhound holding that Kraber...

1331
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,860
That could've...

1332
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,200
Why the fuck did that team push us just to sit down?

1333
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,340
I repeat without scanning and they're just 3 men sitting in the back.

1334
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,140
In a bin.

1335
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,380
I mean... But they have purple and reds too.

1336
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,020
So it's like...

1337
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,340
They could fight, obviously.

1338
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,160
I'm hungry.

1339
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,580
You are 20 something years old.

1340
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,320
You are not hungry.

1341
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,040
You're hungry.

1342
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,160
Oh man, I'm not gonna lie.

1343
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,640
We would have done a better job with the Kraber here for sure.

1344
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,340
Yeah, that could have been you!

1345
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, I mean I would have hit at least one more shot than this guy.

1346
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,400
Maybe it was like a blessing because then you wouldn't whiff in front of everybody.

1347
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,220
Oh my god, that's so true.

1348
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,620
I just three man swung a team.

1349
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,800
I just swung a three man into a bin though and died for it.

1350
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,520
That's pretty embarrassing as well.

1351
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,780
But it's good that you died so you could IGL us better.

1352
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,860
You're so right.

1353
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,480
Yeah, I feel like my comms really just improved there actually so much.

1354
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,120
Yeah, yeah.

1355
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,820
The moment you died your comms just...

1356
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,860
Your IGL just got so much better.

1357
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,920
You're so right.

1358
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,340
You're so right.

1359
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,100
Bro, what the fuck is going on?

1360
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,440
What is this fight?

1361
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,980
What the fuck is this fight I was watching?

1362
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,640
Okay, there we go.

1363
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,180
Alright, nice guys.

1364
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,560
Let's go.

1365
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,460
Good shit dude.

1366
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,220
We got that.

1367
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,540
Guys, we did it!

1368
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,120
We did it.

1369
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,020
That's automatic round clutch probably.

1370
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,120
That's a round qualification right there.

1371
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,840
How many points is that actually?

1372
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,140
Nine?

1373
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,820
That's nine.

1374
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,180
Nine.

1375
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,120
Or wait, twelve, nine, ten, five.

1376
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,600
Nine, yeah.

1377
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,260
Wait, did we die fourth?

1378
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,160
We died fourth.

1379
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,940
We're fourth place.

1380
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,600
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1381
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,240
That's nine.

1382
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,140
That's a lot of points right there.

1383
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:19,080
Top ten is... top ten you're gonna need... fifteen.

1384
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,520
Oh shit, okay.

1385
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,680
We just need six more points and we're in.

1386
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,340
Okay, team eleven... team... oh, team eleven is def... is it...

1387
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,100
Wait, that's not even zone Davis.

1388
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,540
Who the fuck is team eleven?

1389
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,880
They got twelve kills.

1390
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,460
They got twelve kills.

1391
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,700
Wait, why did zone Davis die in...

1392
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,780
Zone Davis died ninth!

1393
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,720
They only got three kills!

1394
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,120
Wait, don't tell me we're getting a new code every time!

1395
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,040
Oh.

1396
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,740
Uh... I don't know.

1397
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,020
I'm refreshing the page.

1398
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,080
Oh my god, bro, zone Davis fell off, man.

1399
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,360
They let this random team eleven get more kills.

1400
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,560
Guys, we're in fourth place with nine points!

1401
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,480
Oh my, look at us!

1402
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,980
I guess we are getting a new code?

1403
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,460
I don't...

1404
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,780
I guess everybody's fucking leaving.

1405
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,760
New code every game?

1406
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,660
And then go to tournament.

1407
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,780
Okay, yeah.

1408
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,440
I mean...

1409
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,000
So this is like 10 minutes later.

1410
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,460
Okay, yeah.

1411
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,940
We're still waiting for the code to come out.

1412
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,180
Okay.

1413
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,580
This is 10 minutes later, but House of Volume...

1414
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,860
We already got through.

1415
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,600
It's already 42 minutes deep.

1416
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,560
But like House of Volume, guys.

1417
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,280
Yeah, yeah.

1418
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,020
Was that like really bad for y'all?

1419
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,700
Or like...

1420
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,640
How many viewers did we drop in the last 25 minutes, guys?

1421
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,400
Can anyone let me know?

1422
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,100
Has the volume been okay after 42 minutes?

1423
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,640
It has not been there at all.

1424
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,820
Just fucking noise and meaningful.

1425
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,300
Oh, I got food.

1426
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,340
Oh, food.

1427
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,580
I got food.

1428
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,620
Because my mom gave me my food.

1429
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,800
I'm no longer hungry.

1430
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,980
I'm still EP though.

1431
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,640
You're hungry, EP, and your mom gave you food.

1432
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,180
That's fucking debilitating.

1433
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,760
I'm like a Tamagotchi.

1434
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,600
I've never been so jealous ever in my life, bro.

1435
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,840
Tam, put that new code in when you can.

1436
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,840
Yeah, I'm gonna drink my soup.

1437
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,320
I am also making food.

1438
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:14,660
How?

1439
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,080
Right now?

1440
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,940
How are you doing that?

1441
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,440
Do you need a toilet break too?

1442
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,480
What?

1443
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,840
I have a...

1444
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,000
I have a...

1445
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,320
Fuck, what do you call it?

1446
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,180
I have a camera on top of my stove.

1447
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,640
So I can see the...

1448
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,260
I can see my stove from my...

1449
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,560
From my room.

1450
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,560
So I know when my food is cooking.

1451
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,980
And I can just run over.

1452
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,180
You run over?

1453
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,600
It's the most modest tempo shit I've ever heard in my life.

1454
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,520
What?

1455
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,180
You have like a dog camera on your stove?

1456
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,140
You have a dog camera on your stove?

1457
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,120
Wait, what?

1458
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,300
To look over what's going on in your stove?

1459
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,280
In your AFK?

1460
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,380
Like a baby?

1461
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,840
I gotta see if my water is boiling.

1462
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,240
Like a baby monitor.

1463
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,320
Your kitchen is your fucking baby.

1464
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
You have a baby monitor.

1465
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,180
It's the most modest tempo shit I've ever seen in my life.

1466
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,900
The code is in the lobby.

1467
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,380
We are ready for round two.

1468
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,140
Let's go.

1469
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,400
Well, technically round one.

1470
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:19,900
Yeah.

1471
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,620
Round two of round one.

1472
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm just going to write in.

1473
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,280
We're doing it guys.

1474
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:27,900
We're doing it.

1475
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,380
Now if you really want to get crazy here.

1476
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,440
If we really get like a good game here.

1477
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,500
All I'm saying is we can just have a fun time for the last two games.

1478
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,200
I'm not against it.

1479
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,040
Oh shit.

1480
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,860
That would be so great.

1481
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,480
Yeah.

1482
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,660
Okay, maybe like we should have our fun times at the last game.

1483
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,060
Not the third game as well.

1484
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,020
You're smart.

1485
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,280
Cause you know.

1486
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,140
Jordan.

1487
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,340
We're in fourth place.

1488
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,360
Yeah bitch.

1489
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:53,940
Sorry.

1490
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,320
Yeah.

1491
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,260
I'm just trying to flex about when there's only 15 teams.

1492
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,420
I'm pretty sure.

1493
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,240
I'm pretty sure.

1494
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,660
I'm pretty sure Jordan can get top four by himself.

1495
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,160
Yeah.

1496
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,240
So cute.

1497
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,660
You wouldn't even need two more players.

1498
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,280
Like he's good.

1499
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:11,980
Uh.

1500
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,040
Blood bang.

1501
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,600
And then probably caustic blood bang.

1502
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,460
On the other map.

1503
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,200
Thanks for the raid.

1504
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,100
Thanks for the raid bro.

1505
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,280
Thanks for the raid.

1506
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,540
Can Jordan coach us?

1507
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,180
I'm not a beginner streamer.

1508
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,760
Can Jordan like coach us live?

1509
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,840
Contesting in a 15 team lobby is crazy.

1510
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,400
Oh someone definitely could.

1511
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,980
Yeah I saw some contesting.

1512
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:35,780
Yeah.

1513
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,800
Easy work.

1514
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,340
I wish they had that like one.

1515
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,840
The new thing they're gonna do for split two.

1516
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,640
Wait did Davis got contested?

1517
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:50,760
I think so.

1518
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,400
Yeah yeah yeah.

1519
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,340
What the fuck?

1520
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,620
If he doesn't make the next round that's a W for us.

1521
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,540
There was like two people that put north pad or something.

1522
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,120
And then two people that put like launch pad or zeus or something.

1523
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,640
And everyone's just landing on each other.

1524
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,280
And I said okay.

1525
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,760
I will not tell anyone that they are landing on each other.

1526
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,520
Wait we shouldn't say what our POIs are or they'll start landing on us.

1527
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,940
We should type it out like all the pros.

1528
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,360
They see that we're already qualified so they're scared.

1529
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,080
If they land on us.

1530
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,240
We have nothing to lose anyway.

1531
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,500
What's the deal?

1532
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,740
We haven't guaranteed shit.

1533
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,460
What do you mean?

1534
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,400
We can literally die last every time.

1535
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,560
Hey we still get one point.

1536
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,580
That doesn't make fifteen.

1537
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,400
That brings us to twelve.

1538
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,540
Yeah that's three points short from qualifying.

1539
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,100
So let's go kill a team.

1540
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,480
And then we're solid.

1541
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,940
Alright let me...

1542
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:52,420
I mean I didn't expect a full three man in a bin bro.

1543
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,400
What?

1544
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,160
This guy said why did you swing solo?

1545
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:57,980
I had to kill you.

1546
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,320
I didn't expect a full three man in a bin.

1547
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,500
Wait we're all three just hiding in a bin?

1548
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,220
In a bin!

1549
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,680
What the fuck?

1550
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,140
That was hilarious.

1551
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,200
Wait did you see that...

1552
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,500
I don't know if it was a glitch or if it was a hack.

1553
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,120
I saw a TikTok or something on Twitter.

1554
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,300
Where it was like someone opened up a bin.

1555
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,040
And three people actually popped out of the bin.

1556
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,000
I don't know.

1557
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,720
They like glitched themselves in behind a pill.

1558
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,460
And then someone opened the pill and just three people popped up.

1559
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,260
And then he died.

1560
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,640
That is actually unreal.

1561
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,080
That is fucked up.

1562
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,880
This is the question I'm asking everyone in today.

1563
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,580
I'm asking everyone and every love we're in today.

1564
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,480
This exact question.

1565
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,340
Like chicken parm or meatball marinara subs more?

1566
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:47,560
Yeah.

1567
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,400
Every TFT game I play that's the first thing I say in the chat.

1568
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,100
And I don't say anything else.

1569
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,040
Wait.

1570
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,700
I think I have this answer to be honest.

1571
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:54,960
Really?

1572
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,220
Yeah I do.

1573
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,800
What if I don't like either?

1574
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,220
It depends on the quality of the sub man.

1575
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,280
What if I don't like either?

1576
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,960
What's your judgement?

1577
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:11,080
I mean dude it's just chicken color is just so much better than meatball marinara.

1578
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,060
I think like chicken and brie is much better.

1579
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,500
Chicken and brie with cranberry.

1580
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,720
Oh that's a very fancy taste from you.

1581
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:19,480
I respect that.

1582
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,580
I see my street now.

1583
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,180
You're a woman of class huh?

1584
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,780
You can't afford this.

1585
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,680
You can't afford my brie.

1586
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,520
You can't afford this sandwich.

1587
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,440
Oh shit.

1588
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,760
You can't afford this bitch ass.

1589
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:40,500
Alright guys.

1590
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,840
Game just ended on our ten minute delay.

1591
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,500
Yeah my whole chat was saying let's go tempo go.

1592
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,080
And when I died they died.

1593
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,080
My whole chat said actually washed.

1594
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,260
Feeding washed.

1595
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,940
I said we gotta stop going he's a fucking goat.

1596
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,420
When your chat starts cheering for tempo.

1597
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,980
You know something's wrong.

1598
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,980
You know you did something wrong.

1599
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
This is unreal bro holy shit.

1600
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:11,700
Wait.

1601
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,440
Woah woah woah.

1602
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,980
You just went straight ASMR on me I kinda like that.

1603
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,040
Okay.

1604
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,120
Wait.

1605
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,940
What am I typing?

1606
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,200
No.

1607
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:24,580
No.

1608
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,600
No.

1609
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,420
It's crazy.

1610
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,140
No is crazy.

1611
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,200
I respect it though.

1612
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,220
But they stopped for me.

1613
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,820
Am I important enough that they'll stop for me?

1614
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,660
Hell no.

1615
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,800
It's like match starting.

1616
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,200
Oh no.

1617
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,740
Not a fucking chance.

1618
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,480
Alright I think we fixed the mic issue.

1619
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,060
Alright I think we fixed the mic issue.

1620
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,620
Okay wait so um.

1621
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,040
Am I playing the same thing?

1622
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:55,260
Bing?

1623
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,320
I think so yeah.

1624
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:56,780
I'm down for that.

1625
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,980
Okay I can still eat then.

1626
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,860
I don't have to pick anything.

1627
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,200
No you're good you're good.

1628
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,140
Eat up eat up you're chillin.

1629
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,800
I mean if your eyes are still not seeing 280 FPS.

1630
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,520
I need you actually to get on like 48 fucking milligrams of caffeine right now.

1631
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,120
180 milligrams of caffeine.

1632
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,840
Oh that's not me.

1633
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,600
That's not what I'm playing.

1634
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,120
I'm playing this.

1635
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,200
I will be honest with you guys I'm not a great bot on here.

1636
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,020
As you can tell.

1637
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,600
I'm gonna try my best you know.

1638
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,040
Wait did we people scan?

1639
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,000
No not once.

1640
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:25,700
Oh.

1641
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,700
We didn't have anyone anywhere that we could do that.

1642
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,660
Oh okay yeah yeah yeah.

1643
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,680
We had to go all the way to Bean but I think that was a dumb route to do that.

1644
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,340
But the scanning got us into the building.

1645
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,100
Scanning did but also your fucking control.

1646
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,000
Yo you see my charge rifle?

1647
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:39,780
Number 74.

1648
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,740
Nice good for you.

1649
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,460
How many kills have we ranked worldwide in kills?

1650
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:45,980
Wait no.

1651
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,180
Can't you look at that Demba?

1652
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,140
What's your rank worldwide in kills for charge rifle?

1653
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,260
How do you look at that?

1654
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,300
I think you can.

1655
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,360
Oh okay actually.

1656
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,840
I was number one in RE45 kills.

1657
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,860
I was number one Mirage in Canada.

1658
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,700
We know.

1659
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,340
Guys look at my Mirage kills.

1660
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,760
I just needed to remind you guys.

1661
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,300
It's a very prestigious.

1662
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,220
I'll never forget.

1663
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,480
He just died.

1664
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,760
Julia guys.

1665
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,560
We're two for two on beacons man.

1666
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,220
We're rich.

1667
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,720
Why can't we have this in Twitch Rivals?

1668
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,780
That was like actual money.

1669
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,660
We don't win jack shit.

1670
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,800
We don't win money from this.

1671
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,760
Yeah but we also just.

1672
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,940
We get 14 pros trying to run us down.

1673
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,100
We're just fish food bro.

1674
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,320
The bottom of the food chain in Twitch Rivals.

1675
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,180
It was your Twitch Rivals too.

1676
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,740
I know.

1677
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,180
It's so sad.

1678
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,240
It's so fucked up.

1679
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,300
They did that to your own headline event.

1680
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,200
I love how you love that for us though.

1681
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,600
Makes for a better storyline.

1682
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,320
You know when I went outside after we lost.

1683
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,160
Like horribly.

1684
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,080
And we got 19 and he got 20th.

1685
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,460
I thought he was going to be laughing about it and stuff like that.

1686
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,620
But I called him a loser and shit.

1687
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,880
I went out there and he was mauling.

1688
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,860
Cause we got mauled.

1689
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,220
He was so.

1690
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,760
He was like that was one of the worst events we ever played.

1691
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,300
He should have casted.

1692
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,580
He should have casted.

1693
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:16,740
Feels bad.

1694
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,180
I was like you suck bro.

1695
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,600
He was laughing with me.

1696
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,300
I was like nope.

1697
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,320
To be fair.

1698
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,520
It's worse cause he was first pick too.

1699
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,100
Well it's worse but dude his teammate.

1700
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,020
Which I don't know how this happened.

1701
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,640
But his teammate never played the game before.

1702
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,760
What?

1703
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,740
Yeah I don't know how that happened.

1704
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,420
I have no idea.

1705
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,520
That's why I was like super confused.

1706
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,780
I had to talk like.

1707
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,040
Why did Riptar pick him?

1708
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
He was the last pick.

1709
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,240
Oh he was the last pick.

1710
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,640
I don't know how that works.

1711
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,780
Alright wait did you hit the circle yet?

1712
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,280
I didn't.

1713
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,460
I'm going over now.

1714
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,640
You're going to do your thing bro.

1715
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,500
Is anyone going to grab the cash?

1716
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,580
I'll go grab it actually.

1717
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,900
Yeah if you can that would be great.

1718
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,640
I'm going to run close.

1719
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,340
Our loading patterns are so funny.

1720
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,120
Guys my eyes are slowly seeing more frames now.

1721
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,400
My eyes turned on.

1722
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,620
Yeah my eyes are turning on.

1723
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,060
So good for us guys.

1724
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,660
Okay C note.

1725
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,860
Oh C note cave.

1726
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,460
That's weird that guy told me have you ever seen the C note cave zones.

1727
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,200
Then we just go here.

1728
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,320
That guy write the script or what the fuck.

1729
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,180
Hackermans.

1730
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,280
Oh my god.

1731
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,480
We're hacking the system?

1732
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,520
There's a...

1733
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,300
That would raise you up tempo.

1734
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,640
Tempo is always really quiet.

1735
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,280
No no no I moved my mic into my mouth.

1736
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,200
Oh that's good.

1737
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,360
Okay good eat that mic.

1738
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,900
Yeah eat it up baby.

1739
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:44,900
Oh yeah.

1740
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,240
And then video record it.

1741
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,540
And then privately send it to like Wigs private channels you know.

1742
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,180
Wigs tier 3 mods.

1743
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,760
I mean tier 3 subs.

1744
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,280
Yeah you know the mod.

1745
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,980
Guys I don't have a charge rifle.

1746
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,020
That sucks dude damn.

1747
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,040
Alright any evac towers?

1748
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,740
Probably not right?

1749
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,900
No I only have a rez.

1750
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,940
You have one evac tower?

1751
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,220
Okay we don't want to use it yet.

1752
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,180
Alright you guys ready to retake?

1753
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,140
I'm ready.

1754
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,080
I think we can hit this cannon.

1755
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,020
You guys want to risk it for the biscuit?

1756
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,000
Let's just hope team 11 isn't there.

1757
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,360
Team 11 is a real threat now.

1758
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,780
They're the ones that got like 12 kills.

1759
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,460
Yeah we should go for team 11.

1760
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,500
Let me go first and I'll let you guys know what's happening.

1761
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:33,800
Alright.

1762
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,120
I'll yell if I need you okay?

1763
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,820
You guys can definitely take it you're good.

1764
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
There's no one even close.

1765
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,960
It would be so funny if they're just hiding like behind that rock.

1766
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,840
I can't lie I'm being brave buddy.

1767
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh they just drove by us with a chardon.

1768
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,640
It's all good.

1769
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,100
They got out.

1770
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,420
Oh I guess they won't ignore it.

1771
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,880
They're walking out we're good.

1772
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,000
They're walking out we're chillin.

1773
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,740
Let them walk up and actually see where they go.

1774
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,620
They're gonna get the package and then they're gonna probably just rotate into the cenote.

1775
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,900
I see them.

1776
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,940
I'm running behind this just in case.

1777
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,220
I shouldn't shoot them.

1778
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,600
No you can shoot them for sure.

1779
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:09,900
I'm gonna shoot them.

1780
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,320
I wanna put up maybe an evac tower down here and just get into cenote.

1781
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,420
Do you want to point down?

1782
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,860
Yeah put them right here buddy.

1783
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,060
We're gonna try to just fly in this way.

1784
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,200
We're gonna just take a building in there and see how it goes.

1785
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:21,940
We can rotate in from there.

1786
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,880
Just follow my pathing okay?

1787
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,580
We're gonna go left actually.

1788
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,860
Follow my pathing guys.

1789
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,480
Follow me!

1790
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,860
I'm not gonna hit a tree this time.

1791
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,800
Follow me to your imminent death.

1792
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,460
Let's go guys.

1793
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,960
We're gonna land right on this one.

1794
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,540
And we're gonna keep on walking in.

1795
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,280
Yay!

1796
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,300
Just keep swimming.

1797
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,240
We're doing it.

1798
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,200
We are.

1799
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,540
We're always doing so good guys.

1800
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,600
I believe in us.

1801
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,980
If we do so well in this game and get like top 3 then we can fuck around.

1802
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,860
Oh yeah now we can easily fuck around.

1803
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,060
Alright we're gonna take this building from them.

1804
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,100
We should like contest a team.

1805
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,300
We should.

1806
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,840
We could just pick Zone Davis.

1807
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,300
Okay not Zone Davis.

1808
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,420
We should grief him.

1809
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,080
I mean he's gonna qualify anyway.

1810
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,600
So we might as well grief him.

1811
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,040
He definitely qualifies no matter what.

1812
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,040
Oh a whole team across this building.

1813
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:13,580
Okay watch out.

1814
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,360
Whole team staring at my door from across.

1815
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,980
Team on this building too.

1816
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,640
West side.

1817
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,580
White armor.

1818
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,320
Get shit on kid.

1819
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,080
There's a team on the west side too.

1820
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,020
Yeah yeah.

1821
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:23,960
Yeah.

1822
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,680
We're gonna get a good spot in Zone.

1823
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,360
We're gonna get a good spot in Zone.

1824
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,660
I need to Pythagorean theorem.

1825
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,500
Just keep pulling back.

1826
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,120
That would be a pretty crazy pull if it doesn't.

1827
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,440
Peek me.

1828
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:35,800
Peek me.

1829
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,180
Peek me.

1830
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,640
Yeah peek her.

1831
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,060
Peek her guys.

1832
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:38,420
Peek her.

1833
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,560
Come on I wanna shoot my gun.

1834
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,480
I have zero damage.

1835
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:43,920
Try cuz you're eating.

1836
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,260
You know I can eat actually.

1837
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:46,740
I'm gonna...

1838
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,140
I don't know if you can take damage.

1839
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,420
Yeah I'm gonna just eat what the fuck.

1840
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,340
Why not?

1841
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,700
Why don't you push me while I'm eating?

1842
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,140
They're gonna find out 10 minutes later and I'll be done eating.

1843
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,980
I don't know I feel like you're a very slow eater.

1844
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,520
Am I right?

1845
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:04,640
Okay maybe.

1846
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,740
Yeah I feel like you definitely are.

1847
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,580
I get the vibe from you that you take like 45 bites and you're like Okay it's cuz like I watch a show while I eat.

1848
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,600
I love it.

1849
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,260
It's a healthy thing to do.

1850
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,460
Digesting slow is smart.

1851
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,560
Yeah that's true cuz like you can it makes you like eat less.

1852
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,540
I did math.

1853
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,660
We have 12 things.

1854
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,600
You have 12 what?

1855
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,120
I'm like the opposite.

1856
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,920
I literally destroy food in like 20 seconds.

1857
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,840
Why is that healthy for your stomach if you eat too fast?

1858
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,940
It's really unhealthy actually.

1859
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,800
I said that once or twice.

1860
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,600
Yeah that's why you fucking disappeared last like two days ago.

1861
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,860
No I fell I fucking knocked out for like 8 hours.

1862
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,360
I was dead.

1863
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,880
I didn't know you could shoot through this.

1864
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,300
This is crazy.

1865
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,980
That's what I'm looking... oh okay.

1866
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,580
I shot him already.

1867
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,360
He already knows.

1868
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,520
I shot him with 121.

1869
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,760
Let him know we're here.

1870
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,040
Yeah.

1871
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,200
I'm having a great time guys.

1872
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,960
I honestly guys...

1873
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,420
This is pretty fun dude.

1874
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,540
I can't wait to spend 6 more hours with all of you.

1875
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,100
Guys, Pete is in the crack so I can shoot you.

1876
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,240
You got a lot more to go.

1877
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,920
Once the games get harder it'll actually be like way less way more fun to be honest.

1878
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,780
It's kinda easy games are a little bit boring.

1879
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,700
A little bit more boring.

1880
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,220
I think it's just there's not a lot of teams so you don't see a lot of fights going.

1881
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:27,480
Yeah and also like you know you know your good probably no matter what the fuck you do unless you're like really really struggling at the game.

1882
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:27,820
Yeah.

1883
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,580
You can shoot through that crack by the way.

1884
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,120
You can yeah.

1885
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,420
I shot someone for like 130.

1886
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,100
That was crazy.

1887
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,280
I wish we could still farm armors for each other.

1888
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,820
Now we actually have to contribute.

1889
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,600
And that's another thing that makes the game more boring too.

1890
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,880
Like rotating this out and you just can't farm shit anymore.

1891
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,160
It takes so much damage to do so.

1892
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,660
Now I can't coast.

1893
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,540
Now I actually have to farm with you guys.

1894
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,600
Now you need to also run a sniper.

1895
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,840
Now we have to run triple sniper.

1896
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,840
No I don't think we should do that ever.

1897
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,820
I have a purple R9.

1898
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,180
R9 is fucking ass.

1899
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,320
I didn't know it was going to be good for us.

1900
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,380
I have a blue R9.

1901
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,100
I mean I just have a... I might just use a bolt at that point.

1902
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,800
I see someone's gun.

1903
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:12,900
Should have honestly...

1904
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,900
Shoot his gun bro.

1905
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,440
Take the fucking barrel off kid.

1906
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:18,940
Mad Maggie.

1907
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:20,480
Maaam.

1908
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,000
Okay I kind of like that though.

1909
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,620
That's on Davis.

1910
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,780
I might eat it.

1911
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,600
They're fucking around now.

1912
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,260
Mad Maggie everyone.

1913
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,100
He's number one right?

1914
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:30,720
He's number one.

1915
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,100
Keep a look out to see where number one does.

1916
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,420
Alright I'm done eating.

1917
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,100
I'm not hungry anymore let's go.

1918
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:37,860
I'm just EP.

1919
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,300
Let's go.

1920
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,180
You're still EP though?

1921
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,300
Go take a nap.

1922
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,640
I'm going to go sleep.

1923
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,240
Just tell me how we do.

1924
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,320
Take your power now.

1925
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,440
It's actually so good for you.

1926
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,580
Tembo takes power naps for sure.

1927
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,140
Oh shit.

1928
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:56,800
Look out door.

1929
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,720
Piece of shit man.

1930
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,700
Tembo I don't even know when Tembo... How many hours of sleep do you get daily?

1931
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:01,900
Oh my god.

1932
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,380
He knows.

1933
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,680
I don't know.

1934
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,960
I don't even want to know bro.

1935
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,240
Sometimes I fall asleep on my desk.

1936
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,560
For 20 minutes at a time.

1937
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,220
Bro what?

1938
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,020
Do you not take actual sleeps?

1939
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:16,060
Like...

1940
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,280
I don't think so.

1941
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,820
Not sleep for real.

1942
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,480
That's the team that ran over everyone.

1943
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,120
That's the team that fucking fights everybody.

1944
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:26,980
That's the team that fucking fights everybody.

1945
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,480
Maybe they WK Davis.

1946
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:29,980
Let's go.

1947
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:31,940
C Davis put him down or what?

1948
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:32,820
That's not good for us though.

1949
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:33,440
I want to see Davis out.

1950
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,380
Respectfully.

1951
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,000
What are you talking about?

1952
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,960
C Davis doesn't qualify?

1953
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:39,920
What are you talking about?

1954
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:39,920
C Davis doesn't qualify?

1955
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:40,660
Yeah.

1956
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,600
He's just a threat.

1957
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,120
That's why we contest him.

1958
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:44,940
That's why we contest him.

1959
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,920
Who's what.

1960
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,060
What?

1961
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:47,420
What?

1962
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:53,950
Oh, wow.

1963
01:00:56,330 --> 01:01:00,490
I literally don't know where people are.

1964
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:04,570
Also, Tama, make sure you keep putting your gen down on cooldown.

1965
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,550
Because we're not leaving anytime soon.

1966
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,570
Yeah, we are living here now.

1967
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,110
For a little bit at least, yeah.

1968
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,470
For sure.

1969
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,650
There's like a team... oh, I see a team.

1970
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:14,190
If you guys want easy shots here.

1971
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:15,510
I was shooting there.

1972
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,510
I'm trying to shoot this team now.

1973
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,990
Oh, they've run back.

1974
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,870
Oh, yeah, he's running back and forth.

1975
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,870
Wait, they're all the way up here.

1976
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:24,950
What the fuck is that?

1977
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:27,330
He's on this rock all the way up here.

1978
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:28,810
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

1979
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:30,810
Why is that so high?

1980
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:31,370
Why is that allowed?

1981
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:32,910
I think the zone is actually going to end back there too.

1982
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:33,550
This is a really bad zone.

1983
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,010
I can't lie.

1984
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,270
Well, I have a thingamajig.

1985
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:37,230
Oh, yeah.

1986
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,910
I think there's going to be a bomb pulling, bro.

1987
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:39,250
Evac?

1988
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:40,270
Yeah, yeah.

1989
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,090
I know.

1990
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,090
I don't even know if I can take any back.

1991
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:42,950
Oh, my God.

1992
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:43,570
What did I just get with?

1993
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:45,930
Oh, ouchies, guys.

1994
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:46,590
You got hit with the magi.

1995
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:48,570
Ouchies, dudes.

1996
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:49,030
What's going on?

1997
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,770
Oh, that's not a person.

1998
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,230
That's a really good magi.

1999
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:51,410
Oh, yeah.

2000
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:52,410
Suck it, bitch.

2001
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,250
Team 9 dead.

2002
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:54,990
Nice, guys.

2003
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:55,710
Team 9.

2004
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,170
Nice.

2005
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,190
Two more teams.

2006
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:57,210
Two more teams.

2007
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:57,670
I see them up here.

2008
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,530
I headshotted him.

2009
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:01,730
He got scared and ran away.

2010
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,830
Bro, this guy's the best player in the world or what?

2011
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,010
Oh, yeah.

2012
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:08,150
You can't out-snipe the sniper master.

2013
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:09,910
He's going to break your fucking gen.

2014
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,090
That's a really good view.

2015
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,790
I can't lie.

2016
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:14,710
He knows the angles.

2017
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,570
Our gen still has a little bit of a chance.

2018
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:17,290
He's got a little bit of HP left.

2019
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,830
How is that even possible?

2020
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:19,630
I don't know.

2021
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:20,570
It's been hit for a while.

2022
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,290
Yeah, what the fuck, man?

2023
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:24,530
I'm not going to give you fucking stuff, bro.

2024
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,150
What the fuck?

2025
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:27,950
Wait, they smoked us.

2026
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:30,150
I mean, yeah, if they push us, they're morons.

2027
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:30,730
I hope they don't do that.

2028
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:33,730
It would be so funny if they did.

2029
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:34,670
I'm watching a team down here.

2030
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:36,110
I know we've got the kill them at two times.

2031
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:36,810
I'm kind of down for it.

2032
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:40,730
They're fighting across.

2033
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:42,890
No.

2034
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:43,630
Just preparing shots.

2035
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:47,790
I'm just going to troll them.

2036
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:49,670
I mean, yeah, why not?

2037
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:50,130
Fuck it.

2038
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,290
I'm going to troll this one team and just smoke them every time.

2039
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,350
Just block their one LOS.

2040
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:56,650
Oh, wait.

2041
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:58,950
You can't even get damage for that anymore?

2042
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:00,410
What?

2043
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:00,810
The smoking?

2044
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:01,210
Yeah, now.

2045
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:01,430
Yeah.

2046
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:02,350
Isn't that crazy?

2047
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:04,430
Wait, I think they left the house.

2048
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,210
Wait, I don't know actually.

2049
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:08,050
No, they smoked me.

2050
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:08,670
Never mind.

2051
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,170
The team's still here?

2052
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,370
Yeah, they are still there.

2053
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,130
Yeah, well, the team's back here.

2054
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:17,770
I mean, taking the top, so like if we need to, we can go across the top left side.

2055
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:18,870
Team top left.

2056
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,250
Take the team house.

2057
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:21,150
The top house.

2058
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:21,610
Watch out, Wig.

2059
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:22,470
The guy behind you.

2060
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:23,190
Whoa!

2061
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:25,930
It's our coach.

2062
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,450
Our coach came into my room.

2063
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:29,430
Wait, can he coach us too?

2064
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:29,910
Yeah.

2065
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,850
Do we just have the entire TSM coaches?

2066
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:33,490
Yes.

2067
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,990
They're all watching from behind the screen.

2068
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,130
We need that.

2069
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,210
We need that.

2070
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,150
Yeah, we need every help we can get.

2071
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:42,370
Yeah.

2072
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,970
Tell them to hit up Destroyer Room.

2073
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,590
Tell them to reach out to Destroyer.

2074
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:47,590
Give it to Wig.

2075
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,530
He's too likeable for people to hate him.

2076
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:50,310
Hello?

2077
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:50,850
Hello?

2078
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:54,610
I'm getting to try to start aimbotting the whole fucking lobby.

2079
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:56,150
360 spray?

2080
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,790
People would just be like, oh silly Wig.

2081
01:03:58,850 --> 01:03:59,930
You're so funny.

2082
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,470
What a silly little guy.

2083
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:06,590
What a silly little guy.

2084
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,370
Oh my god, look at him.

2085
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:09,230
Alright, come on.

2086
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:09,890
Give us the pole.

2087
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:10,490
Give us the...

2088
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:10,930
Nope.

2089
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,650
What the fuck is this zone?

2090
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:15,150
Fuck?

2091
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,130
Bro, what?

2092
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,290
Do we even be here?

2093
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,930
We need to take the height of this building, to be honest.

2094
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:20,310
Is there...

2095
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:21,610
We need to.

2096
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,610
Is there anything that... any rocks that we can play out here?

2097
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:25,570
Like, what is this?

2098
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:25,730
I don't know, bro.

2099
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,110
Do we just... I'm gonna be honest, guys.

2100
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,570
I don't think we can survive this in any way.

2101
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:29,010
Do we just die?

2102
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,590
Do we go out the back of this house and just rip an evac tower and say fuck, wait, what happens?

2103
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,270
Yeah, sure.

2104
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:33,890
Do we...

2105
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:35,330
Oh, no, we don't have an evac tower.

2106
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:36,410
I evac towered us here.

2107
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:37,210
Yeah, we don't have it.

2108
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,030
We just have res beacons.

2109
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:39,330
We're so dead, guys.

2110
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:40,350
I'm gonna put a res beacon out.

2111
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:41,190
Wait, wait, wait.

2112
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,310
Having a res beacon is good.

2113
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,290
We can go into the water, put two res beacons down, and hide behind it.

2114
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:47,610
Wait, this show needs to... What am I watching?

2115
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:48,590
Alright, we need to...

2116
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:50,150
We need to get the height of this building.

2117
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:50,830
We need to get the height of this building.

2118
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:51,870
Can you smoke these windows, Dokie?

2119
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:52,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2120
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:52,510
Right here.

2121
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,510
Alright, we need to climb this to get up on the building.

2122
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:55,410
Oh, that was an awful smoke.

2123
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:55,910
It's okay, though.

2124
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:56,350
We got this, guys.

2125
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,250
I knew that was a great smoke.

2126
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:58,750
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna climb this.

2127
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:59,130
Just get up.

2128
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:01,650
Just take the height so we can actually play maybe a little bit.

2129
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:02,650
So we can see what's going on?

2130
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:02,870
Yeah.

2131
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:03,910
Yeah, cause like...

2132
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:05,150
They're fighting down here.

2133
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,630
It was a great smoke cause we lived.

2134
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:08,190
I cracked two over here?

2135
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:08,710
I knocked one.

2136
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,310
I'm looking for you.

2137
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,070
There's someone here with us, right?

2138
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:12,610
Okay, I'm gonna flash one.

2139
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:13,010
In this building.

2140
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:13,510
Yeah.

2141
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:14,450
I just...

2142
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,850
I'm just trying to look to see what the fuck's going on.

2143
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,290
Where we can play.

2144
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:16,830
They're scouting me so they know.

2145
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:17,830
We can...

2146
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,810
Oh, they can't play over here.

2147
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:19,130
They're fighting.

2148
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,690
They're over here.

2149
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,750
Oh, there's nothing to play.

2150
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:20,990
I got one.

2151
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:21,310
I got killed.

2152
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:21,610
I got killed.

2153
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:22,290
Nice, nice.

2154
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:23,330
I fend off my fend off.

2155
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:23,850
Yeah, yeah.

2156
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:24,170
Okay, wait.

2157
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,070
You guys keep doing that.

2158
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:25,830
I'm gonna look to see what we can play.

2159
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,650
Oh, I didn't...

2160
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:29,530
Watson, Jen...

2161
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:30,890
This is...

2162
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:31,190
I'm safe.

2163
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,030
Oh, I'm definitely not safe here.

2164
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:39,510
I'm blind.

2165
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:41,710
There's a team right here.

2166
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:42,930
Are you listening?

2167
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,390
I'm ready whenever.

2168
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:47,390
We're gonna have to smoke our back when we jump off the height though.

2169
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:48,310
Because the team is gonna shoot us.

2170
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,910
We're gonna swing left.

2171
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:53,450
We're gonna swing then we're gonna jump down.

2172
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,550
And then you smoke our middle here to cross over the rock.

2173
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,750
Here?

2174
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:00,290
We're gonna jump down left and you're gonna smoke middle when we cross the rock.

2175
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,150
Full heal first.

2176
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,370
I have to smoke this now.

2177
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:05,450
Yeah, you're good.

2178
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,110
I'm watching the team over here.

2179
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:07,850
Yeah, you're about.

2180
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:09,250
I'm okay now?

2181
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:09,630
I can go?

2182
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:10,450
Okay, ready?

2183
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:11,510
We're gonna cross now.

2184
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:11,770
Go, go.

2185
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:13,690
Jump off, slide left side.

2186
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:15,950
We're gonna go to this rock.

2187
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:18,630
Look at that smoke!

2188
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,030
We're good.

2189
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:20,230
Nice.

2190
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:20,850
Good fucking smokes.

2191
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:21,770
Just play on the rock.

2192
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:22,090
We're good.

2193
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:24,090
Just shoot behind us.

2194
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,310
There's a guy right here.

2195
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:26,250
I'm looking out.

2196
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,650
Nope, I can't.

2197
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,110
I missed every shot.

2198
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,090
We're good.

2199
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:35,950
Shoot this kid.

2200
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:36,790
Bang ult this.

2201
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:37,430
Bang ult this if you have it.

2202
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:38,050
Okay, I'm banging.

2203
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:40,610
And grenades, if you have two.

2204
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:43,070
I only have one grenade left.

2205
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:44,950
I have three.

2206
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:45,230
I have three.

2207
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:45,710
I dropped one.

2208
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,590
I fucked him up too.

2209
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:47,970
We're good.

2210
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,070
I dropped an A for you.

2211
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:51,650
I didn't flash.

2212
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:53,010
Somebody flashed over there.

2213
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:54,690
We might want to wipe this to be honest.

2214
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,050
Can we move up a little bit on this or no?

2215
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:56,950
Can you smoke our mid or no?

2216
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,010
We can't.

2217
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:58,350
We can't.

2218
01:06:58,770 --> 01:06:59,810
I think we just left them.

2219
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,110
Yeah, but they're gonna angle us out probably.

2220
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:03,130
I arc.

2221
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:05,770
I hit one.

2222
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,090
Hey, you guys stay there.

2223
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:07,430
You guys stay there.

2224
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,610
You're good.

2225
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:10,790
I'm waiting for a scan to see what goes on.

2226
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:12,330
Tell me a duo.

2227
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:13,970
Can you guys come over here and wipe this with me?

2228
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:14,990
We're gonna push them and wipe this.

2229
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:15,350
Okay, okay.

2230
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:16,690
No, no, no.

2231
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:18,310
They corner wave.

2232
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:19,290
They corner wave.

2233
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:19,950
We're good.

2234
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:20,230
We're good.

2235
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:20,550
We're good.

2236
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:21,650
Look.

2237
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:21,930
Dip.

2238
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:22,490
Dive.

2239
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:22,950
Dodge.

2240
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:23,410
Duck.

2241
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:24,650
What is this?

2242
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,370
What is this?

2243
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:27,530
Bro, we're just dead.

2244
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,390
There's actually nothing to do with this zone.

2245
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,570
What the fuck is this zone?

2246
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,770
I mean, we actually have nothing to do.

2247
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:34,530
This is crazy.

2248
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:36,610
We can run.

2249
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,550
We can just mile run.

2250
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,410
Let's just let them kill each other first.

2251
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,990
Yeah, we just wait for more people to kill each other.

2252
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:45,090
And we make that run at the same time.

2253
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:48,070
I can try to smoke them from here.

2254
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:48,310
Right here.

2255
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:48,550
Right here.

2256
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:49,830
Yeah, I'm gonna move right over.

2257
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:50,350
You guys stay there.

2258
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,010
Wait, wait, wait.

2259
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:53,350
He portaled back to here.

2260
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:54,830
Oh, he did.

2261
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:55,750
What a fucking moron.

2262
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:56,950
Alright, we gotta move.

2263
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:57,710
Let's move on.

2264
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:59,310
Look out for him if we can, Ducky.

2265
01:07:59,330 --> 01:07:59,770
I'm trying to.

2266
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:00,330
Wooo!

2267
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:03,010
I hit him 70 red.

2268
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:03,830
Nice.

2269
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:04,130
Good smokes.

2270
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:08,430
I'm gonna try to literally just put a fucking Moby Res down and sit behind it.

2271
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:08,670
Me too.

2272
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:09,410
Me too.

2273
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:10,170
I'm gonna kill Red.

2274
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,110
What is that?

2275
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,350
Wig shield!

2276
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:14,050
Wig shield!

2277
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,170
I'm holding up one.

2278
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:17,750
What is this zone?

2279
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:21,430
Bro, that is so not red.

2280
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:22,590
What is that?

2281
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,890
Wait, wait, wait.

2282
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,210
We got our three points.

2283
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:26,030
We're at 15 now.

2284
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:26,490
We got six!

2285
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:30,310
That is the dumbest fucking shit I've ever heard.

2286
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:30,890
I got a kill.

2287
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:32,470
I got a kill for us too.

2288
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,770
Bro, what is this zone?

2289
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:35,450
What is that zone?

2290
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:37,770
There's nothing you can do there.

2291
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:38,410
No matter what.

2292
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,290
Unless we're a Newcastle team, we're literally dead.

2293
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,010
That is fucking crazy.

2294
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,810
That was the craziest zonefall ever.

2295
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:47,450
Jesus Christ.

2296
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,990
That might be the worst zone I've seen ever in ALGS.

2297
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,510
I've never seen that zone before in my life.

2298
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:56,030
Put that in the ALGS Discord so we can get them to remove it.

2299
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,230
That guy in our lobby is hacking.

2300
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,650
He literally said, Have you ever seen those zones?

2301
01:08:58,690 --> 01:08:59,250
And it just happened.

2302
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:01,310
Wow!

2303
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,610
Destroy is in your chat!

2304
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,410
He's in...

2305
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,930
He's in your chat.

2306
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:10,250
He's in your chat.

2307
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:10,370
Bro!

2308
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:11,970
What's his name?

2309
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:15,090
Let's ask him what the next zone is.

2310
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:16,410
Let's ask him what the next zone is.

2311
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:16,590
Let's ask him what the next zone is.

2312
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:17,290
Yeah!

2313
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:21,610
You got a little insight on what the next zone is?

2314
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:23,630
Yeah, you know what the next zone is, bro?

2315
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:24,330
Come on.

2316
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:25,990
Give us a little...

2317
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,360
We love that zone.

2318
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,200
We love that zone.

2319
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,260
That's actually just the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.

2320
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,260
Packer man.

2321
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,660
I can't believe that was real.

2322
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,040
That was a crazy zone.

2323
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,900
I wanna see my chat's reaction to that, bro.

2324
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,900
I'd be like, what the fuck is that book?

2325
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,560
What the actual fuck is that?

2326
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:55,620
I'd be like, what the fuck is that book?

2327
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:56,800
Ooh.

2328
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,580
It's okay.

2329
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,080
It's okay.

2330
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,620
No way it could happen again.

2331
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:05,580
No way.

2332
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,180
We're gonna get a really good zone this game.

2333
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,160
No way.

2334
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:08,800
We're gonna get a really good zone this game.

2335
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,040
How many points does that six place?

2336
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,100
We can play Caustic.

2337
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,220
I gotta kill.

2338
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:13,820
I gotta kill.

2339
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,320
Three and then Doki's kill.

2340
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,420
Oh, so four points.

2341
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,880
We need one more point and we fucking...

2342
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,400
No, we need two more points and then we qualify.

2343
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,400
Well, no.

2344
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,400
We get two more points just because there's only 15 teams in the lobby now.

2345
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:24,880
No!

2346
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,340
That's one point.

2347
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:27,740
That's one point.

2348
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,840
Well, I mean, one point for next game and then one point for last game.

2349
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,160
True.

2350
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:31,580
Yeah.

2351
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,380
So we can... No, no.

2352
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,040
We fuck around the last game.

2353
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:35,720
What if like...

2354
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:36,620
Yeah, yeah.

2355
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:37,380
Last game we fuck around.

2356
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,260
We still need something here.

2357
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,840
Last game, are we contesting Davis?

2358
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,500
Let's go down.

2359
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,300
Yeah, fuck that guy.

2360
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,780
I don't know who it is, but fuck that guy.

2361
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,160
We're in sixth place.

2362
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,440
We're in sixth place.

2363
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,360
Almost.

2364
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:51,740
Okay.

2365
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:54,960
I'm not worried about it.

2366
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:55,760
Oh, no.

2367
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:57,000
It doesn't feel that safe though.

2368
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,100
We're in sixth place.

2369
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,400
Yeah, it doesn't feel safe.

2370
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,200
It feels very unsafe.

2371
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,360
It feels like Prince Jerry.

2372
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:11,080
We need Zone Davis and Team 11 to just roll everyone.

2373
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:12,700
Nah, bro.

2374
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:15,140
We're dealing with Team 11.

2375
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,000
Oh, wait.

2376
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:16,940
I'm caustic now.

2377
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,060
Oh, yeah.

2378
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:23,120
Zone Davis and Team 11, if you're watching this stream 10 minutes later, kill every team but our team.

2379
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,080
Agreed.

2380
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,100
So then you can get content more from us.

2381
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,080
You can farm us for content.

2382
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,480
If we get in the same game as team.

2383
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,540
Zoom out.

2384
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,520
Let me know you put the code in.

2385
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:38,660
Let me know you put the code in.

2386
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:38,700
Yep.

2387
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,220
So geyser, siphon, and tree should all have someone.

2388
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,100
Okay.

2389
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:43,940
And harvester.

2390
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:44,740
What's the code?

2391
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,000
That's in that direction.

2392
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,640
The code just came out.

2393
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:50,720
Let's see.

2394
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:51,780
There we go.

2395
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:53,440
Nice.

2396
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:57,500
I'm in.

2397
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,760
I got in before Wig did.

2398
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,480
I am hacker, man.

2399
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,240
I'm in.

2400
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,720
We're fucking doing it, guys.

2401
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,080
Good shit.

2402
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,540
We're locked the fuck in now.

2403
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,240
That was the worst round possible.

2404
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,740
World's Edge is really easy.

2405
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:13,900
Where are we landing on World's Edge?

2406
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,220
Stacks.

2407
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,540
So playing Bang Blood?

2408
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:20,000
I don't know.

2409
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:20,760
I don't want to play that.

2410
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:21,580
I think it's a fucking combo.

2411
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,360
Yeah, we definitely want caustic here for sure.

2412
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,200
So what should we play then?

2413
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:27,420
Fuck.

2414
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,880
Zone Davis is going stacks.

2415
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:30,060
Okay.

2416
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,860
Wait, who's Tartman?

2417
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:32,880
No idea.

2418
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,280
Was anyone countdown?

2419
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,060
Wait, if he's going stacks...

2420
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:38,680
Oh, he said siphon.

2421
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,120
He said siphon.

2422
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,160
He said siphon, I mean.

2423
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:43,060
Motherfucker.

2424
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,700
Zone Davis banning you from pro league scrims after you make it into pro league.

2425
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,860
No, we'll prevent him from making it.

2426
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:51,460
Yeah.

2427
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,580
Start trending that, bro.

2428
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,240
Start trending that.

2429
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,660
Use that to our advantage, big dog, honestly.

2430
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,800
Zone Davis ban from ALGS tournament.

2431
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,720
You'll never get into pro league if you kick us out.

2432
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,460
If you land on us.

2433
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,480
I'll also gatekeep.

2434
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,460
I'll never have your POV up.

2435
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,920
It's not a threat.

2436
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:10,840
It's a promise.

2437
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:14,120
I don't make threats.

2438
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:14,980
I get even.

2439
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,440
I don't make threats.

2440
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:19,200
I'm realistic.

2441
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:24,240
You know, I actually have to say I admire how optimistic we were we were going to make it across that water.

2442
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,540
Honestly, if they weren't focusing on us, we're good.

2443
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,920
I think it's because someone shot... who shot at them?

2444
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,280
Who the fuck shot at them?

2445
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,820
Definitely not me.

2446
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,940
That was me.

2447
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,780
Yeah, I was going to say they didn't know we were there.

2448
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,040
They were shooting at us first.

2449
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,440
No, I was literally watching.

2450
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,640
They didn't know we were there until somebody shot at them.

2451
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,260
I was like, who the fuck shot them?

2452
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,060
They were not paying attention.

2453
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,180
They were 100% shot at us.

2454
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,280
And then I was like, oh, you want to play this game?

2455
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:56,740
To be honest, that rock looked a lot closer than it actually was.

2456
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,820
Because it looked closer when we were at our rock.

2457
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:05,080
And then as I started running, I was like, it looks like this rock keeps getting further away.

2458
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:06,640
That's so true.

2459
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,700
I was like, wait a minute, I'm running but it's not getting any closer.

2460
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:13,800
I was confused.

2461
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,260
And then I was like, I'm going to run back and then it didn't work.

2462
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:21,400
Yeah.

2463
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,200
Alright, so...

2464
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,140
You want to run back and then run again?

2465
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,700
I don't mind running whatever.

2466
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:27,600
I can do whatever.

2467
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,300
Or should we run?

2468
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,020
Yeah, run back and I'll run back again.

2469
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,380
Fuck it.

2470
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,040
Wait, why were you hesitating then?

2471
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,620
Because like, Valk is just so good.

2472
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,760
Like that, I don't know.

2473
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,020
It's just so tough we don't get evac towers.

2474
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:40,360
That's why.

2475
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:41,360
And Wedge?

2476
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,600
I'll go run back and you can go Valk.

2477
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:46,300
Um, yeah.

2478
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:46,880
Let's do that.

2479
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:47,400
Yeah, okay.

2480
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,420
People will think I'm you and it'll get scared.

2481
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:51,220
Exactly.

2482
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,460
Like, oh shit, controller run away.

2483
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,200
And then you shoot better than me anyway.

2484
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:59,840
Yeah, because obviously people will put the controller player on blood so they'll be like, that has to be Wig.

2485
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,020
Like, I don't want to get close to them.

2486
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,960
I mean, I can't believe that was real sound.

2487
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:06,380
That was insane.

2488
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,860
That was actually crazy.

2489
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,820
I'm leaving you guys behind.

2490
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,100
I'm 100% just sending you in there.

2491
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,740
Oh, someone just said we should have grabbed a car.

2492
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:18,120
And we could have put the car in front of us as we run up.

2493
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,660
Yeah, but that's hindsight.

2494
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,240
Like, we're weird.

2495
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,480
We were not close to any cars.

2496
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,580
I don't know where any other cars are.

2497
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,180
No, our cars were so far away.

2498
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,280
Oh.

2499
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,900
It's time for candy.

2500
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:37,660
I got worm candy, guys.

2501
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:41,080
Damn, Zone Davis got the zones unlocked but damage?

2502
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:41,480
Nah.

2503
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,120
Goddamn.

2504
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,580
Holy shit.

2505
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,220
Oh wait, that's his teammate.

2506
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:48,880
Yeah.

2507
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,560
Oh shit, team 79 are duels.

2508
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,050
Dan is logging over.

2509
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:04,550
Had to install Origin.

2510
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:06,070
Come on, Dan.

2511
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,170
What the fuck, Dan?

2512
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:10,190
Poor Dan.

2513
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:13,810
I can't believe how crazy that was.

2514
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:17,430
I'm hungry again, bro.

2515
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:17,490
I'm hungry again, bro.

2516
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:18,630
You're hungry?

2517
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,450
Now I'm hungry but not eating.

2518
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:22,890
Call your mom to bring food over.

2519
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:25,370
I'll make her fly in from Florida.

2520
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:25,950
Yeah, yeah.

2521
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:27,710
I'm not fucking horrible, but come on, Dad.

2522
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:30,830
Come on, fucking terrible.

2523
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:34,270
Be like, mom, bring me food.

2524
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:34,490
It's okay.

2525
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:37,390
When you move here, I'll be your in-house chef anyway.

2526
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:37,950
So we're good.

2527
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:39,710
Oh my god, you're like his maid.

2528
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,650
So about me moving to Texas.

2529
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:44,370
Motherfuck.

2530
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,050
You're not moving to Texas?

2531
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,330
Nah, probably not.

2532
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,230
Yo, taxes.

2533
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:50,290
Yo, taxes.

2534
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:52,210
I know, bro, but like Texas.

2535
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:56,290
What's wrong with Texas, man?

2536
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,090
No, it's a great place.

2537
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:01,010
Then why don't you move there?

2538
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:02,090
Yeah.

2539
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,210
It was so great.

2540
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,150
I might need roommates, man.

2541
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:09,230
I was gonna say a very, very, uh, very political joke.

2542
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,650
I'm gonna...

2543
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,490
Oh, okay.

2544
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:12,590
Never mind.

2545
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:15,450
I'm not smart enough to debate this shit.

2546
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:17,490
I'm not smart enough to debate this shit.

2547
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,990
I know where my intelligence stops.

2548
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:21,950
Where it starts.

2549
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:24,250
Wait, what do you mean you might need roommates soon?

2550
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:25,890
Yeah, what the fuck does that mean?

2551
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:26,750
Yeah, what does that mean?

2552
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:29,730
TSM's not paying for the house anymore.

2553
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:32,430
Oh, so you guys are all...

2554
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:33,170
Bro, confirm?

2555
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:33,930
That's crazy.

2556
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:34,990
That's so crazy.

2557
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,150
You guys heard it here, right here from my stream.

2558
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,510
If any news article want a quote, quote it from Doki Bird.

2559
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,270
From the Doki Bird stream.

2560
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:46,110
Be ready to tag Doki Bird.

2561
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:47,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2562
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:49,030
TSM makes money and TSM doesn't, guys.

2563
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:54,130
Exclusive, uh, exclusive news drop from Doki Bird stream.

2564
01:17:55,230 --> 01:17:55,750
Exclusive, uh, exclusive news drop from Doki Bird stream.

2565
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,750
I think every esports org is just broke.

2566
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:58,330
I think every esports org is just broke.

2567
01:17:58,330 --> 01:17:58,930
That is true.

2568
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:03,730
House isn't being covered, so everyone's gotta figure out what to do.

2569
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:04,710
House isn't being covered, so everyone's gotta figure out what to do.

2570
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,190
Everyone's splitting up.

2571
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:11,070
Well, Evan and Jordan are gonna play from home.

2572
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:11,670
Well, Evan and Jordan are gonna play from home.

2573
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:13,070
So that they don't have to pay rent.

2574
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:14,190
Oh, that's right.

2575
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,270
But I don't wanna go back to Canada.

2576
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:17,370
So...

2577
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:18,670
Hell no.

2578
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,670
Yeah, I didn't shoot them first.

2579
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:21,630
I just saw my VOD.

2580
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:25,330
I don't think... I think we got shot from the right side the whole time.

2581
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,010
Not even the left.

2582
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:28,210
Left side shot us.

2583
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,410
Oh, left side shot us first?

2584
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:32,010
And then I just returned fire.

2585
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:33,410
And then I hit them for 70.

2586
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:36,270
I thought you shot them first.

2587
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:37,510
Cause they weren't shooting me.

2588
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,430
Yeah, they shot me.

2589
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:41,890
And then I was like, oh you wanna play this game?

2590
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:43,610
And then we died.

2591
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:45,230
Yeah, and then they're like, yes.

2592
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,110
And then we died.

2593
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:48,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2594
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,410
I played Bloodhound.

2595
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:50,770
Where's Valk?

2596
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:51,590
Where's Valk?

2597
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:52,710
Top right.

2598
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:54,510
Oh god, that was so scary.

2599
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,730
That was so scary.

2600
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,210
I got the blood on lock.

2601
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,170
Wait, who healed in the open?

2602
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:06,130
My favorite is me, bro.

2603
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:06,810
I was like 1 HP.

2604
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,310
I was like 1 HP out of about...

2605
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,870
Bro trying to heal in the open.

2606
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:12,110
That's my favorite one.

2607
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:13,290
Chad just seized that zone.

2608
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:17,290
Like, bro, you could've made that if you just popped 6 batteries, did a 360 times per dick show.

2609
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:19,910
I heard about people who might go 3-ass would've made that one.

2610
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,630
1 HP is a Bloodhound crossing in open water.

2611
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:24,510
What the fuck you want me to do?

2612
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:25,210
Just go.

2613
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:26,770
Like, spawn in wing?

2614
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:32,510
Honestly, we might be able to grab big mod too if...

2615
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,370
Nah, there's some there.

2616
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,610
They called it in the chat.

2617
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:36,170
Really?

2618
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:38,750
Yeah, the name's like Simple or something like that.

2619
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:39,410
S-I-M-P-O.

2620
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,290
I'm gonna go land...

2621
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:45,930
I'm gonna take these buildings so I can grab the beacon.

2622
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,170
Let's make sure.

2623
01:19:47,230 --> 01:19:49,150
Just stick on me right now just in case we...

2624
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:50,370
Just in case.

2625
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:53,390
Are you...

2626
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:55,750
Okay, so that pink team is going...

2627
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:57,030
Mod?

2628
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,890
Why does it seem like they're very short?

2629
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,630
That pink team to our left is very short.

2630
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:05,370
They're going Geyser.

2631
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:08,870
I don't see anyone near us for mod.

2632
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:09,910
I don't either.

2633
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:12,370
If you guys wanna go...

2634
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:12,990
Mod?

2635
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:13,690
You wanna go to mod tempo?

2636
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:14,110
I can go.

2637
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:14,430
I can go.

2638
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:14,850
No, no, no.

2639
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:16,670
I have to go here because I need the beacon.

2640
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,150
I'll go mod and just loot it up.

2641
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:18,790
You guys go over here.

2642
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,070
If I get late landed, I'll just scream.

2643
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,010
Yeah, I mean... well, we cannot craft everyone.

2644
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:25,570
It'd be like, we can craft you.

2645
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:26,930
And I was like, no, we cannot.

2646
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,250
I guess we run as a duo.

2647
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:29,850
Someone lands on us.

2648
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:30,990
Nah, we fine.

2649
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:31,510
There's no one here.

2650
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,310
I did find this though, first bin.

2651
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:36,770
Scanning the beacon.

2652
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:38,630
It's okay, it's gonna be here buddy.

2653
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:40,230
He's gonna cry, no, he's gonna cry.

2654
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:41,510
Okay, I forgot where it is.

2655
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,530
Here's a 6x2.

2656
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:46,510
Okay, not great for us, that's for sure.

2657
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:47,530
If we landed sky...

2658
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:49,590
Sky west, we would've been...

2659
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:50,910
Solid.

2660
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:52,650
That's right, we gotta valk.

2661
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:56,790
Also, make sure to take your goddamn evac towers, please.

2662
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:59,710
If I can find one...

2663
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:01,370
I have...

2664
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:03,550
I have 345 purple, flatline purple.

2665
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:04,770
This is pretty fucking dog shit.

2666
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:08,970
We can just pick up like a million Evo harvesters on our way.

2667
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:11,010
And just be red when we go into zone.

2668
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:11,990
That's true.

2669
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:14,870
Yeah, except we're on the complete opposite side.

2670
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:16,190
Nah, that's probably the right call.

2671
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:18,470
I'm nooting.

2672
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:19,850
I don't have a good gut.

2673
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:22,690
I mean, I have nemesis, alternator, but I prefer not having these.

2674
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:23,410
I have double R9.

2675
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:24,970
I feel rich.

2676
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,290
I am scout, flatline.

2677
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,870
I only want two times, so I'm gonna drop it over here.

2678
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,090
Can you ping it?

2679
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,030
Yeah, I got you.

2680
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:31,610
Yeah.

2681
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:34,410
Alright, I guess I'll run nemesis.

2682
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,150
I guess I'll run in our nemesis.

2683
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:38,310
Actually, this is a little far.

2684
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:40,330
I'll take the exile in my pocket too, just in case we need it.

2685
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,090
I have one as well.

2686
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:45,770
Ooh!

2687
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:49,170
Grab as many heals as possible since we don't have...

2688
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,010
I got an ulti-exile.

2689
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:57,110
I didn't loot this if you want to loot this tempo.

2690
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:57,970
I didn't loot this if you want to loot this tempo.

2691
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:00,010
I didn't loot this building.

2692
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:05,490
I have a purple heavy mag for someone.

2693
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,190
I'm not running one.

2694
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:11,310
And a purple energy mag for someone.

2695
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:13,430
Ooh, I need that.

2696
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:14,670
Yeah, you can take that.

2697
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:15,910
Oh, another purple backpack over there.

2698
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:17,890
Holy shit, I'm actually finding crazy loot over here.

2699
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,330
We're rich, god damn.

2700
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:20,610
We're so rich.

2701
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,410
I can't lie, this big mod has a lot of stuff we need.

2702
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,410
There's a vault here too.

2703
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:26,370
Is there an R9 in there?

2704
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:28,050
Yeah, there's a blue one.

2705
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:28,570
It's pretty nice.

2706
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:32,310
I don't know what I'm looting anymore.

2707
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:35,330
Definitely better than nothing if you need an R9.

2708
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,210
You have to take it.

2709
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,850
Yeah, but I'm already running a nemesis.

2710
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,530
I don't think I'm going to have enough.

2711
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,570
Oh, there's another!

2712
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,310
Actually, I'm going to run...

2713
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:45,270
Do you still have the heavy mag tempo or no?

2714
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:46,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2715
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:48,350
Okay, I'm going to run flatline then.

2716
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:50,230
Instead of an alternate.

2717
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:52,070
I'm dropping a...

2718
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,430
I put pretty kidded alternate stuff.

2719
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:58,190
Okay, I'm good.

2720
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:01,070
I'm going to dip out and start walking forward to the paintball.

2721
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:02,590
I grab that evac tower.

2722
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:05,810
I'm going to grab that 2x and also that backpack.

2723
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:08,070
I'm going to grab that 2x and also that backpack.

2724
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:09,890
I'm going to grab that charge rifle that's over there and then...

2725
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:09,970
I'm going to grab that charge rifle that's over there and then...

2726
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:10,530
Go for it big man.

2727
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:15,030
Make sure to remember too, we're in the zone and the zone is coming in.

2728
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:17,570
So don't forget that we cannot craft like we can usually do.

2729
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:18,390
So don't forget that we cannot craft like we can usually do.

2730
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:19,310
Just remember that.

2731
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:22,230
Yeah, how many mists can we stay in zone before we die?

2732
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:23,230
Five.

2733
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:24,990
Five?

2734
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:26,590
Five and we are automatically timed out, yeah.

2735
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:27,310
Okay.

2736
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:31,950
There's no way we can fuck that up, right?

2737
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:33,670
Nah, no shot guys.

2738
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,050
No way, right guys?

2739
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:36,350
Another evac here.

2740
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:37,510
Okay.

2741
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,870
I actually should take that for sure.

2742
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:40,430
How did I miss that?

2743
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:40,830
I'm an idiot.

2744
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:43,910
Thanks buddy.

2745
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:45,150
I think it has to do with scan.

2746
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:46,870
Should I still... no I shouldn't.

2747
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:48,170
Nah, you're good.

2748
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:49,170
Where are we trying to run to?

2749
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:52,230
We should probably go through side by side.

2750
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:54,450
Yeah, we should grab something for...

2751
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:55,830
We should grab the evos.

2752
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:57,430
Yeah, for sure.

2753
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:58,970
We should definitely pad our way to like get...

2754
01:23:58,970 --> 01:23:59,550
That one?

2755
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:00,910
Yeah, 100%.

2756
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,450
Then go through like the fragment side and do that as well.

2757
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,670
Like monument, right here.

2758
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:04,230
For sure.

2759
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:06,890
Would it be funny if I ulted just to run faster?

2760
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:08,910
Um, it would... I don't know.

2761
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:10,870
Funny might not be the word, but...

2762
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:15,270
I would giggle if you wanted me to like...

2763
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:16,350
I would giggle for sure.

2764
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:19,150
And then there's just a team right here?

2765
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:20,790
I would definitely giggle.

2766
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:21,590
Oh, balloon.

2767
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:23,510
Yeah, we'll take the balloon and get in.

2768
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:24,390
We'll just get the evo tower.

2769
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:26,550
Or the evo cache.

2770
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:28,510
Holy shit, there's two medkits here.

2771
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:29,130
I'm gonna grab one.

2772
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:31,510
Take that shit.

2773
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,970
Oh, I need a sniper...

2774
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,330
Oh wait, do I hear...

2775
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:37,250
Are those shots or is that just the evo harvester?

2776
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:38,770
No, it's the evo harvester.

2777
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:40,690
It's a shiny.

2778
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:41,530
It's just shiny.

2779
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:43,690
Ooh, shiny.

2780
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,990
Alright, don't forget to bring off this choke too.

2781
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:48,070
I'm going up.

2782
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:49,050
I'm gonna fly up.

2783
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:50,210
Yeah, I'm coming with you.

2784
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:52,130
It's okay, they'll think I'm a controller player.

2785
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:55,550
Do I get Odin's glare or Raven's blessing?

2786
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:57,950
Which one's which?

2787
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:58,870
I don't remember what it is.

2788
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:01,890
Raven's Blessing is the 25% ult when activated.

2789
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:03,010
Yeah.

2790
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:05,390
Or double the duration of the attack.

2791
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,230
I would say the Raven one.

2792
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:08,950
Just make sure you scan your Raven to get your ulti back faster.

2793
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:11,310
So should I ult and then...

2794
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:13,890
Yeah, you could if you want to.

2795
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:16,250
Odin's out of here.

2796
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:21,570
I get ult and so we could charge our Ravens.

2797
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:21,770
I get ult and so we could charge our Ravens.

2798
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,250
Do you want to get this, Evo?

2799
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:27,650
Yeah, I'm gonna go get it for us.

2800
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:29,730
We're gonna go through landslide.

2801
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:31,410
Or actually, nah, fuck that.

2802
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:31,990
We shouldn't go through landslide.

2803
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:33,030
Let's go through the top side of Skyhook.

2804
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:35,630
I think it's gonna be congested.

2805
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:37,050
We could do a ring scan too.

2806
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:39,230
Yeah, if you guys are grabbing that, then I can do that.

2807
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:42,390
Yeah, do a ring scan and then is there any beacon scans we can hit?

2808
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:45,370
Yeah, let's go to top grandmas after this and hit a beacon as well for you, Dokie.

2809
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:47,250
So we know which way to go.

2810
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:51,250
If we want a path towards countdown, we want a path towards Skyhook to see which one's less congested.

2811
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:53,230
There's only 15 teams though, so...

2812
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:55,430
Two teams died too.

2813
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,030
Two of them died.

2814
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:57,750
Two dead.

2815
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:01,990
Contesting when there's only 15 squads is really fucking dumb.

2816
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:02,750
I can't lie.

2817
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,890
Yeah, I can't wait to do that for the last game.

2818
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:06,550
For the last game.

2819
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:08,670
It's so fucking dumb.

2820
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,690
We're gonna have a good game here.

2821
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:11,830
I'm actually being ulted.

2822
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,010
Oh, jeez.

2823
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:16,490
We don't be seeing anything.

2824
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,690
You guys, I...

2825
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:21,650
Wait, did we grab that?

2826
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:22,390
Evil Harvest already?

2827
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,010
Oh yeah, we did.

2828
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:25,830
So there's a team over here.

2829
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:27,830
It's okay.

2830
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:29,430
People will find out 10 minutes later.

2831
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:31,890
It's okay.

2832
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:33,450
Alright, bagged trials, bro.

2833
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:34,070
That is ass.

2834
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:34,650
Wow.

2835
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:36,730
Don't see anybody, by the way.

2836
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,050
There's our stewards.

2837
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,770
Did we do the people scan?

2838
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:43,850
No, we're gonna go do that.

2839
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:44,570
I'm heading over.

2840
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,250
We're gonna do that grandmas right now.

2841
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:48,810
There's a gold light mag.

2842
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:50,650
I'm good.

2843
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:52,730
I will take that.

2844
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:56,130
My mom's in chat laughing about how I said she's a horrible cook.

2845
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:00,230
Which is very true.

2846
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:00,770
It's very true.

2847
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:02,650
I'm waiting for you guys.

2848
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,690
I'm worried that I'm gonna get fucking run over on.

2849
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:05,570
Yeah, you're good.

2850
01:27:05,610 --> 01:27:05,950
I'm coming to you.

2851
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:06,290
You're showing.

2852
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:09,530
I'm running.

2853
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:10,790
I'm running.

2854
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,530
Alright, I need...

2855
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,770
I have four and eight.

2856
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:20,250
I'm gonna go.

2857
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:21,670
Alright, I'm coming.

2858
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:25,270
Okay, let's see.

2859
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:26,630
Let's see how congested everything is.

2860
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,770
Let's see which way we should go.

2861
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:29,170
Here we go.

2862
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,950
If no one's on top of trials, we should just evac tower on there.

2863
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,950
I mean, we have three evac towers.

2864
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:34,630
We might as well.

2865
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:34,990
Yeah.

2866
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:40,140
Alright.

2867
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,700
No one 3, 2, 1s me.

2868
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:45,780
Yay.

2869
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:47,960
I'm gonna send a reactor shove.

2870
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:48,500
You die, I die.

2871
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:51,120
Jesus Christ.

2872
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,780
We're going straight to the top.

2873
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,220
That's one, two, three.

2874
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:57,200
That's like four things.

2875
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,840
They're probably gonna immediately just...

2876
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,100
They're gonna probably immediately do exactly what we did.

2877
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,020
So we're just gonna keep moving forward.

2878
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:03,960
They're gonna just follow us.

2879
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,340
Where are we trying to go?

2880
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:09,240
We're gonna go through Skyhawk and probably evac somewhere.

2881
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,680
But there's no one for us to really go.

2882
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:11,340
This zone's pretty ass.

2883
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:13,200
We have to fight our way topside over here.

2884
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,100
Oh wait, we can grab this thing too while we're here.

2885
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,560
How much does the cash give us again?

2886
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:20,360
300.

2887
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,120
300 I think, yeah.

2888
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,560
I'll be 150 off.

2889
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:24,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2890
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:25,060
We're all...

2891
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:25,980
We all should be 150 off.

2892
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,180
We're all 150.

2893
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,340
Yeah, we're good.

2894
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,260
I mean, if we're...

2895
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,820
Skyhawk, is there any other beacons we can hit while we're here?

2896
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:31,260
Yeah, there are.

2897
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:31,980
We're gonna be able to hit more.

2898
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,400
Hit this, yeah.

2899
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,500
Yeah, and then that'll give us purple.

2900
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,000
I can't... I've really...

2901
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,740
Zones have not been kind to us at all.

2902
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,900
What is up with us playing and having horrible fucking zones?

2903
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,240
It's just life at that point.

2904
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:45,560
That's right.

2905
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,660
It's life for us, I guess.

2906
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,060
Yeah, it's just life for us at that point.

2907
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:52,000
If you guys can find charge rifle stuff...

2908
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,460
I pinged it three times.

2909
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:54,140
I don't know if you took it.

2910
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:54,840
I pinged a six this year.

2911
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:55,820
I just found a new scope.

2912
01:28:57,980 --> 01:28:59,760
Like a mag.

2913
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,220
A mag.

2914
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,400
Ooh, that's another bat.

2915
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,040
Someone take.

2916
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:04,820
I'll take it.

2917
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,620
I dropped a medkit.

2918
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,820
I mean, let's just go take this front side building, yeah?

2919
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:12,060
I mean, let's just go take this front side building, yeah?

2920
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,000
Where the purple skinner is.

2921
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,260
Because I mean, at this point, bro, there's not gonna be much to play in Skyhook.

2922
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,180
I don't think there's anyone there, so we should be able to take this for free.

2923
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:19,440
We'll see.

2924
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,660
We'll just get in this building first and then move forward.

2925
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,400
We can just scan it.

2926
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,300
Oh, I think I hear someone from it.

2927
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,080
Are we scanned?

2928
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,600
Nah, nah, nah.

2929
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:26,820
We're good.

2930
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,260
The other building we wanna scan is up here.

2931
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,240
Can I get that beacon or no?

2932
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,360
Um, I would if you could, but if you can't...

2933
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:33,740
Do it.

2934
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,540
It'll be so funny.

2935
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,440
If you die, it would be pretty funny.

2936
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,380
Yeah, it'll be so funny.

2937
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,560
Are we scanned?

2938
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:39,920
Yeah, sure.

2939
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:40,200
Scan.

2940
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,220
Oh, they are in here.

2941
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:41,780
No, they're not.

2942
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:42,020
They're not.

2943
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:42,220
Okay.

2944
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:42,980
I'm just gonna go up there and break the wall.

2945
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,960
I'm chilling here until I can scan beacon.

2946
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,300
I do think it's good.

2947
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:48,520
They're on the other building.

2948
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:49,700
That's fine.

2949
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:55,030
I hope I don't die.

2950
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,450
It'll be so funny, though.

2951
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:58,050
I hope you don't, too.

2952
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:58,770
Oh, they're grenade me.

2953
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:59,090
Oh, shit.

2954
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:00,270
Motherfuckers.

2955
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:00,930
Okay, maybe...

2956
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:01,170
You're good.

2957
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:01,370
You're good.

2958
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:04,630
I fucking stepped on the gas and traps.

2959
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:05,850
Are we good, guys?

2960
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:06,310
Are we good here?

2961
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:07,050
Wait, wait, wait.

2962
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:08,090
I have a plan.

2963
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:10,490
Alright.

2964
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:12,230
Bro, this zone is terrible.

2965
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:14,170
Bro, what the fuck?

2966
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:15,050
Why does everyone hate us?

2967
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,650
I don't know.

2968
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:18,530
I don't know anymore.

2969
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:20,010
I don't know.

2970
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:23,070
He's not really saying anything, so I have no idea what's going on.

2971
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:23,210
I'm good.

2972
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:23,490
I'm good.

2973
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:25,390
We got the scan.

2974
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:26,730
I'm scared of you, everybody.

2975
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:29,950
Can we somehow go up north here and play on penis?

2976
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:31,330
I do want to.

2977
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:33,470
No, I want to play underneath Raven, I think, here.

2978
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:34,550
But I don't know if there's anyone there or not.

2979
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:35,590
I'm trying to skip out the scenes.

2980
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,170
Oh, you guys are here.

2981
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:37,550
Okay.

2982
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:39,090
I'm trying to go Raven.

2983
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:40,630
If there's no one Raven, we should go there right now.

2984
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:41,630
But I don't know if there is or not.

2985
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:43,070
Because there's no one for us to play.

2986
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:44,230
We literally cannot do anything.

2987
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:45,710
We have an evac.

2988
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:47,410
We do, yeah.

2989
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,330
I mean, I don't think we should evac though.

2990
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,190
We could just... we could evac.

2991
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:52,350
Do you guys want to play?

2992
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:52,990
Okay, so here's my thing.

2993
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:54,950
Do you want to play here or do you want to go to Raven side?

2994
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:57,370
I think Raven might be a little bit better for us if we actually play the game.

2995
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:59,370
Might as well go Raven side, yeah.

2996
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:01,210
But I feel like there's going to be a lot of teams there too.

2997
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,850
I do too, but I don't think we can go anywhere else.

2998
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:04,890
Yeah, I don't think we can go out.

2999
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:07,930
There's a lot of teams at Trials side.

3000
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:10,970
Yeah, I think playing towards Raven and trying to get Kp might be the play.

3001
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:11,610
Being able to go out.

3002
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:11,610
Yeah.

3003
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:11,890
I think we can get there.

3004
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:13,030
Wait, am I getting walked out?

3005
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:13,430
There's a team on me.

3006
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:15,270
Wait, I'm going to scan?

3007
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:16,470
Yeah, we're good.

3008
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:19,370
We'll play here for right now and see what these guys do.

3009
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:20,150
They're purple as well.

3010
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:23,070
They're going to try to take our first floor.

3011
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:23,610
Just pressure our guys.

3012
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:24,750
Teemu, put traps down.

3013
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:26,050
You can.

3014
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:28,030
Down first floor and block the doors and stuff.

3015
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,290
I'm being shot from the fucking roof.

3016
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:31,230
Yeah, you're good buddy.

3017
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:31,630
You're chillin'.

3018
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:34,090
They're all the way out.

3019
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:36,590
Well, our building isn't in, so...

3020
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:37,350
No, we're in.

3021
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:37,530
We're in.

3022
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:38,030
We're barely in.

3023
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:38,770
We're going to take our first floor.

3024
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:40,470
Let's kill these kids when they walk in.

3025
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,870
We're fine.

3026
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:41,890
I'm going to the roof then.

3027
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:43,070
Yeah, you're good.

3028
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:43,390
Watch out.

3029
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:43,990
There's bangles up there.

3030
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:45,230
Scanning?

3031
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:45,990
They're running.

3032
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:46,330
They're running.

3033
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:46,910
They're rotating.

3034
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:47,810
It's good.

3035
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:48,270
Yeah, one on one.

3036
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:50,770
Wait till I... I'm going to look at them.

3037
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,010
We're going to go left.

3038
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:55,310
Fucking...

3039
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:56,970
We're in here.

3040
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:57,970
We're in our first floor, I think.

3041
01:31:59,090 --> 01:31:59,730
I'm going to do point.

3042
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:01,010
Go to Doki's side.

3043
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:03,630
We're still in up here, by the way.

3044
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:04,310
Barely.

3045
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:06,970
They conduit-alted us.

3046
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:07,730
Alright, it's fine.

3047
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:09,670
When the conduit goes down, we're going to ult their first floor.

3048
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:10,850
We're going to jump down and ult their first floor.

3049
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:12,730
We need K.P.

3050
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,010
here, bro.

3051
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:14,090
We're not going to be able to play this down at all.

3052
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:15,630
Wait, everyone's...

3053
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,390
What?

3054
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:17,610
Yeah, I've cost gold.

3055
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:19,730
Wait, wait, wait.

3056
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:20,730
They're shooting like...

3057
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:21,430
Yeah, down there.

3058
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:22,850
Wait, wait.

3059
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:23,810
I think I have angles here.

3060
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:25,150
Yeah, never mind.

3061
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:25,930
They full died.

3062
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,230
The team that was behind us full died.

3063
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:30,630
They're like literally in this floor right here.

3064
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:32,650
Wait, there's a team down here too?

3065
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:34,650
Look, I can scan them for you guys in five.

3066
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,390
We're going to kill these guys if they're still underneath us or not.

3067
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:38,390
They are.

3068
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:38,630
They are.

3069
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:38,810
They are.

3070
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:40,190
I literally scanned them.

3071
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:41,050
See?

3072
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:42,430
Right below.

3073
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:44,290
This is so bad.

3074
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:45,330
This zone is awful too.

3075
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:46,130
Like, what is going on?

3076
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:48,090
Wait, do we have room on the roof?

3077
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:51,170
Yeah, I think we should... That team didn't die because it's still 12 squads.

3078
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,430
No, I know.

3079
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:54,210
I want to try to jump down here and play the fence line.

3080
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:55,490
And maybe just Valkyrie from there.

3081
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:57,330
But I don't know what to do because we're getting shot at from everywhere.

3082
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:58,630
This is so bad.

3083
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:01,390
I think there's a team right over here.

3084
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:02,850
Or like a solo.

3085
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:04,130
You're right.

3086
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:04,530
I see them.

3087
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:04,810
I see them.

3088
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:05,550
Yeah, see?

3089
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:08,970
I want to jump down and take the fence and then maybe Valkyrie late game.

3090
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:10,230
I just don't know how we survive this.

3091
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:10,850
There's like no other way.

3092
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:11,910
There's no actual chance we survive this.

3093
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:14,610
Alright, so we're going to jump down.

3094
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:15,150
We're going to go right now.

3095
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:16,510
We're going to go on top floor.

3096
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:18,570
And we're going to go to fence line.

3097
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:20,230
No, we're going to go fence line first.

3098
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,790
Go to this fence.

3099
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:23,450
No, you're good.

3100
01:33:24,450 --> 01:33:26,530
Just jump down the fence right now.

3101
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,410
Just come here and play the fence side.

3102
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:30,230
We're going to get looked at by everybody.

3103
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:30,810
We're going to play from here.

3104
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:33,630
We're going to Valkyrie late.

3105
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:34,890
I just don't know how late we can do it.

3106
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:35,310
We're going to try.

3107
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:36,670
Yeah, Tembo.

3108
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:39,370
Can you look at our backside here and Kosti, go do this right here on the front step.

3109
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:42,090
There's nobody here.

3110
01:33:42,930 --> 01:33:43,490
We're going to find them.

3111
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:43,790
No Kosti.

3112
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:44,110
We're good.

3113
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:45,350
Okay.

3114
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:47,990
We're going to hit a really risky Valkyrie.

3115
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:48,170
Come here.

3116
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:48,510
Come here.

3117
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:48,630
Come here.

3118
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:50,730
We're good.

3119
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:50,930
We're good.

3120
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:52,370
Let's hope we don't die.

3121
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:56,290
We're going to try to land somewhere.

3122
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:58,550
I don't know where we're landing, but this is a really risky ulti.

3123
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:00,990
Can we somehow get on that penis?

3124
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:02,210
Penis tower?

3125
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,110
I don't know if we can.

3126
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:03,670
There's a team up there.

3127
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:04,290
Let out penis.

3128
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:04,710
Let out penis.

3129
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:05,570
There's only one guy.

3130
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:09,130
I'm not landing there by the way because I fucked up my landing.

3131
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:09,650
So good luck.

3132
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:11,210
I'm going to get on him.

3133
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:11,890
Okay.

3134
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:12,150
It's fine.

3135
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:12,670
You did a good job.

3136
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:13,190
I'm alive.

3137
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:16,490
There's nothing to do.

3138
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:18,630
This zone is so fucking dog shit.

3139
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:19,570
God damn it, man.

3140
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:20,470
All right, Doki.

3141
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:20,870
Play your life.

3142
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:21,350
Try your best.

3143
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,050
There's really nothing to do.

3144
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:22,670
Yeah.

3145
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:24,130
You could have gotten us two points.

3146
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:25,250
You're good.

3147
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:26,470
Doki, run on this left side rock.

3148
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,190
If you can.

3149
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:27,870
I don't know if you can.

3150
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:28,610
This is so chopped.

3151
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:29,570
No.

3152
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:32,830
I got slowed.

3153
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:34,650
Why is this so hard?

3154
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:36,930
Why are we getting cooked on everything?

3155
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:38,150
All right.

3156
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:38,390
Wait.

3157
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:40,850
That's three more.

3158
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:41,490
Three more points though.

3159
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,790
Oh my God, bro.

3160
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:48,030
I'm telling you right now, these early rounds are going to be harder because teams just don't know what's happening.

3161
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:51,910
Why is that team running behind us and taking our first four for 30 minutes?

3162
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:54,390
I don't understand what's going on.

3163
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:54,810
I'm losing my mind.

3164
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:57,750
Because they saw us doing it and they're like, they can do it.

3165
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,610
This makes sense.

3166
01:34:58,690 --> 01:34:59,190
Let's do it.

3167
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:01,810
That makes sense.

3168
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:02,690
God damn it.

3169
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:03,130
You know what?

3170
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:05,270
We could have played the front side of the zip line.

3171
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,730
I don't know.

3172
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:09,210
I'm just thinking that teams are going to be playing in these spots and no one is.

3173
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:10,170
So I'm like, oh, okay.

3174
01:35:10,230 --> 01:35:11,290
Well, now I look and I'm like, wait.

3175
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:12,410
I forget we're round one.

3176
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:13,970
No one's even doing anything correctly.

3177
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:15,350
So, my fault.

3178
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:19,070
Wait, did I shoot my gun?

3179
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:21,690
I did.

3180
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:22,610
Oh, thank God.

3181
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:23,490
Wait, wait.

3182
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:23,730
Huh?

3183
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:24,670
I shot my gun.

3184
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:27,350
I was like, did I get chased to shoot my gun?

3185
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:28,430
Everyone has some damage.

3186
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,400
Guys, I shot my gun.

3187
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:35,020
It's all that.

3188
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:35,920
Guys, I don't feel safe.

3189
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:36,880
I don't think I played.

3190
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:38,820
No, we're fine.

3191
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,180
We're fine.

3192
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:39,500
What was that?

3193
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,480
What was that?

3194
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:40,940
What was that?

3195
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,000
What was that?

3196
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:42,560
Three points?

3197
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:42,980
We're good.

3198
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,480
There's no way we don't get at least three points every game.

3199
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:47,280
So, like, let's be honest.

3200
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:47,700
We're good again.

3201
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:48,540
We're good.

3202
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:51,160
What did the other five teams get?

3203
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:51,780
I don't know.

3204
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:54,580
We'll see.

3205
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,280
Wait, what is what?

3206
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,700
The only time I got to use my ult is when I accidentally ulted.

3207
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,920
The only time I got to use my ult is when I accidentally ulted.

3208
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:03,340
No, you're doing great.

3209
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,600
You did a great job, though.

3210
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,320
I'm very proud of you.

3211
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:10,920
We're back.

3212
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:11,140
We're valid.

3213
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:11,400
We're valid.

3214
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:12,200
Don't stress it.

3215
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:13,160
We're all good, guys.

3216
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,820
We're doing it.

3217
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,540
I believe in us.

3218
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:19,100
We're doing great.

3219
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:27,850
Oh, yeah.

3220
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:28,650
Penis is still in.

3221
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:30,030
If we three-hit penis...

3222
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:31,790
Oh, we would have been winning this game, baby.

3223
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:32,490
We would have won.

3224
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:34,950
If three men landed on that cross, we were good.

3225
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:38,270
If we just three men jump on the penis...

3226
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:40,730
If we three men got on this dick, guys, we would have been good.

3227
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:43,990
He couldn't handle all three of us, right?

3228
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:44,630
Yeah.

3229
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:45,950
What a fucking nerd.

3230
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:48,270
Wait, but I think...

3231
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:50,130
Wait, did you land on there?

3232
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:50,870
Oh, no.

3233
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:51,310
I didn't.

3234
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:54,710
I didn't even land on there.

3235
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:55,670
I was like, I'm on it.

3236
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:56,390
I'm on the penis.

3237
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:57,150
I didn't reach it.

3238
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:57,990
I don't know how I didn't reach it.

3239
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:58,810
That's the only one that listened.

3240
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:02,410
Yeah, I don't know how we didn't reach it.

3241
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,350
That's actually crazy, Loki.

3242
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:04,950
You did reach it.

3243
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:05,450
What do you mean?

3244
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:06,550
No, I didn't reach it at all.

3245
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:08,830
I peaced out.

3246
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:10,630
I'm joking, dude.

3247
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,250
She just landed somewhere completely...

3248
01:37:12,690 --> 01:37:14,970
Yeah, but I lived longer for you.

3249
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:16,830
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3250
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:20,190
Because I just don't know what's free and not free with these fucking guys in that game.

3251
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:21,090
I don't know what's going on.

3252
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:24,810
When there's going to be a 20-man lobby, it's going to be so much easier to understand what's happening.

3253
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:25,770
It's just so hard.

3254
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,950
I mean, the fact that we even got that Valkyrie off is Loki.

3255
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:32,670
Alright, 11 and 1.

3256
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:37,890
That's the two teams that we needed to do really well, and they farmed everyone, which is good.

3257
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:38,190
Great.

3258
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:39,150
Good for us, guys.

3259
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:39,650
Let's go.

3260
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:41,810
We're on fire right now, guys.

3261
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:42,110
Honestly.

3262
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:43,130
Alright, last round.

3263
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:44,590
Refresh, refresh.

3264
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:46,870
Let's see what happens, man.

3265
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:47,850
Give me a breakdown here.

3266
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:49,210
We're just in 20th place somehow?

3267
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:53,230
We're at 15th spot, and we're in 20th somehow?

3268
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:56,410
Don't tell me we're on the cusp of not qualifying, bro.

3269
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:58,950
That would be the funniest thing if we don't make it past round 1 today.

3270
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:00,970
Yeah, that would be so fucking crazy.

3271
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:01,970
That would be so funny.

3272
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:02,950
It would be so funny, though.

3273
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:06,590
No, but that would mean we improve so much, though, the next one we do.

3274
01:38:06,690 --> 01:38:07,110
You know what I mean?

3275
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:10,190
You know the next one is next week, right?

3276
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:11,310
Oh, shit.

3277
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:11,730
That's crazy.

3278
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:13,750
It's just back to back weeks now.

3279
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:18,430
It would be so funny if we do so well on this.

3280
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:19,210
It would be so funny.

3281
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:20,950
We just do horrible things.

3282
01:38:20,990 --> 01:38:26,310
If we somehow make it to finals, and it's just like, oh shit, we're in top 5 or whatever.

3283
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:29,330
I think you're on too much copium right now, Tim.

3284
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:30,310
I think you're on too much copium right now, Tim.

3285
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:32,690
You're literally in 6th place right now.

3286
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:34,870
I'm pretty sure we should.

3287
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:35,710
6th place?

3288
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:37,150
But you didn't count game 3.

3289
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:39,330
I don't think we're on 6th place after game 3.

3290
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,570
No way.

3291
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:41,110
No way.

3292
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:46,930
It's just harder to call this shit because no one's doing anything correct in any way possible.

3293
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:50,990
I think if we actually played a bad comp, we probably would do better.

3294
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:51,790
I'm not even kidding.

3295
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:53,230
I would put money that we do better.

3296
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:53,850
I have to pee.

3297
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:54,390
I'll pee right back.

3298
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,050
Hey, it's his first pee!

3299
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:01,650
It's his first pee.

3300
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:03,210
Good for him.

3301
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:05,910
He's never in the floodgates, though, bro.

3302
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:07,170
He's about to pee 47 times.

3303
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:10,150
He's about to pee 49 times, though, now.

3304
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:11,930
Yes, it's true.

3305
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:13,350
I'm gonna go get an energy drink.

3306
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:16,190
Alright, I'll be here to entertain your chat 10 minutes later.

3307
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:17,110
Oh boy.

3308
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:18,230
Okay.

3309
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:20,130
I'm gonna love that, trust me.

3310
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:25,110
Hey guys, so, Wigs Chat, do you know anything about, like, Twitch Prime?

3311
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:26,810
Um, well...

3312
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,270
Okay, alright, alright.

3313
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:36,090
You can't skip this.

3314
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:37,230
This is an unskippable ad.

3315
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:45,310
Alright, so, like, alright, Twitch Prime is basically you can subscribe to your favorite Twitch streamer for free.

3316
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:48,810
So go to the search bar and type Doki Bird.

3317
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:55,270
Um, go to the Twitch search bar and type Doki Bird.

3318
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:58,690
And then, um, I am your favorite streamer right now.

3319
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:04,230
You can Twitch Prime me over there on my Twitch channel.

3320
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:07,370
Alright, code is in the... Oh, you got the code?

3321
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:07,890
Nice.

3322
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:09,070
I'm back.

3323
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:10,690
We are...

3324
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:12,230
We are in seventh.

3325
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:15,090
I don't know, I still don't feel safe though.

3326
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:16,030
We're in seventh.

3327
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:17,250
Yeah, we should probably play normal.

3328
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:18,810
Yeah, I feel like we should play normal.

3329
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:21,970
I think we're like fourth or fifth, I feel safe.

3330
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:23,890
But seventh does not feel safe at all.

3331
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:29,790
Well, actually, we're in seventh, but fifth, sixth, and seventh all have the same amount of points.

3332
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:30,710
Oh, okay.

3333
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:32,550
But what about eighth?

3334
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:34,090
How many points does eighth have?

3335
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:35,670
Like, how many... There are two behind us.

3336
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:36,190
There are two?

3337
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,230
Yeah, I don't feel safe at all.

3338
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:39,710
Four is... Four is twenty.

3339
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:41,990
And then five, six, seven are sixteen.

3340
01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:46,810
And then eight is fourteen, and tenth is eleven.

3341
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:48,550
Yeah, that is... No.

3342
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:51,470
They can easily get, like, points for this.

3343
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:53,450
Yeah, we should just be careful.

3344
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:54,230
We just play normal.

3345
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:58,930
Everyone's just... That means we're just the same rank as we're...

3346
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:02,510
We can keep sliding by in seventh.

3347
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:04,030
All tournament long.

3348
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:05,870
Nice.

3349
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:07,110
Wait, where did Wigg go?

3350
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:08,890
Wigg went to get an energy drink.

3351
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:09,510
He's coming back.

3352
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:11,790
Oh my god, Wigg, run faster!

3353
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:14,770
Yeah.

3354
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:16,930
Wigg, run faster.

3355
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:17,930
You can hear us.

3356
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:18,850
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

3357
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:21,290
Did you hear what I said, Wigg?

3358
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:24,890
Um, I heard you didn't stop talking for like twenty minutes.

3359
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:29,050
I just constantly heard your voice while I was in the kitchen.

3360
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:31,390
What place are we in?

3361
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:31,850
What place are we in?

3362
01:41:31,950 --> 01:41:32,230
Fortieth?

3363
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:35,490
We are in...

3364
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:37,690
We're on seventh place.

3365
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:39,910
Seventh, but we're tied with five and six.

3366
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:43,770
Yeah, but we're not safe at all because tenth place is only, what, three points?

3367
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:44,550
Five points behind us.

3368
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,310
Five points behind us, yeah.

3369
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:46,210
Yeah.

3370
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:48,110
Oh my god, we don't qualify.

3371
01:41:48,170 --> 01:41:48,950
This is hilarious, bro.

3372
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:50,650
That would be so fucking funny, bro.

3373
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:53,210
That would be so funny, dude.

3374
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:54,090
I would actually laugh so much.

3375
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,090
Alright, guys, it's fine.

3376
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:57,830
I'll start trying now.

3377
01:41:59,090 --> 01:41:59,790
Oh, yeah, now?

3378
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:00,830
Yeah.

3379
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:01,990
It's all good, guys.

3380
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:03,210
Before trying now, I get it.

3381
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:03,610
It's all good.

3382
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:05,630
Oh, so that's why we're not doing well.

3383
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:08,450
I haven't tried once yet.

3384
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:10,610
Wait, you guys realize that...

3385
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:11,870
What?

3386
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:16,230
Davis is gonna be in our lobby every single time all the way until finals.

3387
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:16,930
Wait, really?

3388
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:18,690
That's how that works, yeah.

3389
01:42:18,710 --> 01:42:19,270
That's how it works?

3390
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:25,950
The top ten always, like, stick together and they just combine with another top ten that's right beside them.

3391
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:26,630
Oh.

3392
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:27,170
Oh.

3393
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:29,410
That's fucked up.

3394
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:31,750
That is pretty fucked up.

3395
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:32,410
That's fucked up, man.

3396
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:33,890
Can we, like, move to a different lobby?

3397
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:34,870
Can we lose?

3398
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:35,550
Can we just, like, play?

3399
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:38,730
Can they swap us to a different lobby?

3400
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:42,030
Can we just lose and play next week, guys?

3401
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:42,430
I'm done.

3402
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:44,610
Make it easier.

3403
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:45,690
I mean, we can...

3404
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:46,610
It doesn't matter.

3405
01:42:47,010 --> 01:42:49,050
We're not gonna make it all the way to the end.

3406
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:52,610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3407
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:52,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3408
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:54,010
Have a little faith here.

3409
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:55,930
Okay, we're totally gonna...

3410
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:57,430
We're winning one game.

3411
01:42:57,650 --> 01:42:58,050
We're totally gonna...

3412
01:42:58,050 --> 01:42:59,610
We make it to round two.

3413
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:02,930
We make it to day two.

3414
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:04,650
We're winning one game today.

3415
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:05,930
We're winning one.

3416
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:07,850
Will we make it from day two to day three?

3417
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:09,550
Yeah, this is it.

3418
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:12,910
Yeah, I totally believe in us.

3419
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:14,290
Oh, yeah.

3420
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:15,530
100%.

3421
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:18,490
This is my believe it voice.

3422
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:19,870
No, for sure.

3423
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,050
You sound so...

3424
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:25,110
Unreal.

3425
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:27,650
There's no way.

3426
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:28,550
There's no way.

3427
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:32,090
No, never.

3428
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,760
Did they just launch the fucking rank season yesterday without even announcing it?

3429
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,020
Yeah.

3430
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,400
Yeah, no one was doing this like...

3431
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,200
Wasn't it the day before or something?

3432
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,660
It was like the day before, yeah.

3433
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,940
Why would they not say anything?

3434
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,700
That's so bad.

3435
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,380
I like...

3436
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:56,460
It was so funny because I was looking at the Twitch thing and nobody was like doing like rank lag.

3437
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:58,660
Yeah.

3438
01:43:58,760 --> 01:43:59,840
Like the rank one.

3439
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,480
First team for rank one.

3440
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,780
It was like...

3441
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:04,220
You don't even fucking know what's going on.

3442
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,760
He's like, whoa, there it is.

3443
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:11,500
Oh, wait, I should turn my volume back up in game.

3444
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:14,480
You're good, buddy.

3445
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:15,560
We're vibing.

3446
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:18,940
Alrighty, alrighty, alright.

3447
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,240
We're so locked in, guys.

3448
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,260
I'm totally locked in.

3449
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:26,420
Ready, y'all?

3450
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:26,820
Yes.

3451
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:27,980
Let's go, guys.

3452
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:31,180
Unless it's some Hazmine Hotel right now, we're so locked in.

3453
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:34,180
We're so locked in.

3454
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:36,100
It doesn't matter if I say no, they're still gonna start it.

3455
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:37,040
It doesn't matter if I say no, they're still gonna start it.

3456
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:38,160
Ready?

3457
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:38,780
No.

3458
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:39,280
Okay.

3459
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,420
Yeah, they don't care about my opinion.

3460
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:46,080
Yo, Wig.

3461
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,180
Yeah, what's up?

3462
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:49,040
You need some kills here.

3463
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,760
Yeah, where's our fucking roller player?

3464
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:52,980
I'm trying now, bro, I'm trying now.

3465
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:55,220
Where's our fucking roller player gameplay here?

3466
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:56,300
Yeah.

3467
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,480
You need four kills, alright?

3468
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:01,080
You need four kills, alright?

3469
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:04,200
Hey, you stopped it because I said that and then started it again.

3470
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,180
Hey, you stopped it because I said that and then started it again.

3471
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:07,760
We didn't listen to you.

3472
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,200
Yeah, why?

3473
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:10,400
Because I used you as an argument.

3474
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,500
Doki was like, no.

3475
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:14,760
He didn't care what I said.

3476
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:18,680
I used you as leverage.

3477
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:19,320
What do you mean?

3478
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:22,140
I wrote no and he didn't care.

3479
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:22,560
I wrote no and he didn't care.

3480
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:23,720
He still started it.

3481
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,840
That's so fucked up.

3482
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:30,000
Chat, I just don't have that killer instinct anymore, chat.

3483
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:30,780
I'm sorry, dude.

3484
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:31,360
It's not in me.

3485
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:32,800
I'm a changed man.

3486
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,040
I'm literally Thorfin now.

3487
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,520
You're literally a roller player.

3488
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:36,740
What happened to you?

3489
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,060
I don't fight anymore.

3490
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:38,820
I have no enemies.

3491
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,200
So you did fall off.

3492
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,680
No, I played basketball last night and actually got extremely competitive.

3493
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:44,160
But...

3494
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:48,740
I played basketball last night and got actually very upset at the people I was playing with.

3495
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,460
Are we doing a pick up 5v5 in LA?

3496
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:54,200
I mean, I'm down for volleyball instead, big man.

3497
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:54,760
Count me in.

3498
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:56,180
Wait, why volleyball?

3499
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,780
What happened to basketball?

3500
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:59,300
Oh, you mean on the beach.

3501
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:00,420
Yeah, yeah.

3502
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:01,340
I mean, you love volleyball.

3503
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:02,200
That was the whole point.

3504
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:02,720
That's what you love.

3505
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:03,380
I love volleyball.

3506
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,540
I love volleyball.

3507
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:07,540
Yeah, I was on the volleyball team.

3508
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,520
I just spilled gamer anime girl thigh juice all over my fucking lap right now.

3509
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:13,240
Child gamer sucks.

3510
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,680
Yo, use Doki Bird!

3511
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:17,160
10% off!

3512
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:20,520
Wait, actually, do you have one?

3513
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,300
Yeah, I do!

3514
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,400
What would you name your flavor if you got one?

3515
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,360
I'll name it...

3516
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:27,200
What's a good flavor?

3517
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,340
Laugh gas.

3518
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:29,980
Oh, that's a good flavor.

3519
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,400
That's a good one.

3520
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,920
Yeah, yeah, that's a good one.

3521
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,420
But what would the flavor taste like, though?

3522
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,200
I don't know, fucking ass?

3523
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:39,620
What cheeks?

3524
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,580
I want to make sure.

3525
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,160
Oh, we're not getting that.

3526
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,440
Okay, we still get this for free.

3527
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,800
I'm gonna take these two biddies.

3528
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,820
Alright, guys, I'm gonna actually get competitive now.

3529
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:49,240
Let's do it.

3530
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:51,220
I'm gonna lose Domi and Stax, okay?

3531
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:52,220
Fucking idiots, man.

3532
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,360
Just get in the fucking beacon, you dumbass.

3533
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:58,100
Man.

3534
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:00,160
We should get Hal in here instead.

3535
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:01,420
The chat.

3536
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:03,960
He was screaming earlier.

3537
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:06,100
About what?

3538
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,440
Where's the zone?

3539
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,240
Why are you not popping?

3540
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:09,660
Okay.

3541
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:10,900
I got the carbon.

3542
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,780
Ooh, there's a golden mastiff.

3543
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:14,420
Does anyone want that?

3544
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,880
I'm good, but that sounds fantastic.

3545
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,220
I'm good.

3546
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:19,520
Oh, okay, Overlook Zone.

3547
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:20,180
We're good to go.

3548
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:21,680
That's so easy for us, guys.

3549
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:22,940
Yay!

3550
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:24,340
Yippee!

3551
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:25,940
Yippee, guys.

3552
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:26,800
Yippee!

3553
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:27,060
Yippee!

3554
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:27,880
Yippee!

3555
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,580
Okay, I'm grabbing the bat.

3556
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,280
I'm running Carbine!

3557
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:33,700
Carbine Vault!

3558
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:35,020
Okay.

3559
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,880
I swear, I haven't found a single repeater.

3560
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:40,540
Haven't found a single evac.

3561
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:41,880
Yes, you have.

3562
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:43,500
I just found an evac right now.

3563
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,040
Yeah, I was like, fucking idiots.

3564
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,660
I should probably stop doing this.

3565
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,160
Team this mad.

3566
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:51,880
Backpack.

3567
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,440
I've not found a backpack yet.

3568
01:47:57,580 --> 01:47:59,420
I still don't understand how to loot this.

3569
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,280
Oh, I found a repeater, but I already have a Kitted Carbine.

3570
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,780
Oh, I could have a Kitted...

3571
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:10,220
You should probably rotate fast this one, to be honest.

3572
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,200
I'm gonna run...

3573
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:11,920
Just run for it.

3574
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:14,860
Run a repeater this time.

3575
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:16,800
We gotta figure out where to grab the, uh...

3576
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:19,660
the, uh, harvesters from.

3577
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:25,340
Yeah, we could definitely do that, but I think rotating this one might be a little bit more important for us here than this one, just if we want to get points.

3578
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:27,040
And this zone is like, super easy to predict.

3579
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,880
Alright, I'm heading to you.

3580
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:31,700
Is there anything good in the thing?

3581
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:33,300
Uh, purple flatlines?

3582
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:33,760
We want that.

3583
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,200
It's not bad.

3584
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:36,960
I'm good.

3585
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,100
I'm not gonna take the purple flatlines.

3586
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:40,640
I guess I can take...

3587
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,400
No, I'm running repeater, so I don't want to run double heavy.

3588
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:44,820
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

3589
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,100
I need a scope, though, for my repeater.

3590
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:51,640
You could just get it two times off the flatline if you want to.

3591
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:52,560
Oh, I could.

3592
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:53,720
Here's this.

3593
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:54,020
Here's this.

3594
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:57,500
Anyone running Havoc?

3595
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:58,080
I have a turbo.

3596
01:48:58,780 --> 01:48:59,120
Now.

3597
01:48:59,260 --> 01:48:59,560
Nope.

3598
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:00,960
I'm running Havoc.

3599
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:01,900
Actually, yeah, take that, Temba.

3600
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:02,960
I'm gonna pick up this Havoc right now.

3601
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:03,480
Take that.

3602
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:04,820
I have it.

3603
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:07,700
From there.

3604
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:08,860
The smoke came from this direction.

3605
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:10,220
Wait, there's team on us?

3606
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,640
Are they running away?

3607
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:12,440
Yeah, they're running.

3608
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:13,860
Yeah, let them run.

3609
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,660
We want to get in front of these guys, though, for sure.

3610
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,340
I have a balloon.

3611
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:19,080
Or evac.

3612
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:20,120
I don't have an evac.

3613
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:21,880
I don't have a lot of ammo.

3614
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:25,560
I have a kid.

3615
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,180
All right.

3616
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:31,840
I think they went to get the EVO stuff and then left.

3617
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:32,140
Yeah, they did.

3618
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:37,880
All righty.

3619
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:41,000
No, there's a purple backpack.

3620
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:41,980
It's all good.

3621
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:42,920
Just come on through, Temba.

3622
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:43,380
We're getting going.

3623
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:43,760
I'm running.

3624
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:44,080
I'm running.

3625
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:47,140
Wait, there's a people beacon here that we did not scan.

3626
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:48,360
Oh, it really matters, bro.

3627
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,660
It really matters, yeah.

3628
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:51,760
We know it's gonna be free.

3629
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:55,420
By the time we rotate, there's gonna be so many teams in zone compared to what the fuck we're in now.

3630
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:56,260
I'm waiting here.

3631
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:57,420
Oh, wait, we're taking the replay?

3632
01:49:58,580 --> 01:49:59,480
Oh, you can if you want to.

3633
01:49:59,580 --> 01:49:59,940
I'm good.

3634
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:01,500
Honestly, yeah, take it.

3635
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:04,400
Where are we going to?

3636
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:05,860
We're gonna go through Geyser side.

3637
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,500
Let's go through Geyser.

3638
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,980
Where did that other team go?

3639
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:11,160
They went through Geyser as well.

3640
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:12,620
But they're probably gonna go through Geyser tunnel.

3641
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,660
We're gonna go through the Geyser choke.

3642
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:15,740
And probably Valkylde and the topside Geyser choke.

3643
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:22,080
Wait, you guys want to try that Valkylde from...

3644
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,860
That Valkylde that goes like...

3645
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:25,860
Do you want to try it?

3646
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,200
I'm gonna... I've never done...

3647
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:31,420
Guys, I'm not safe at all.

3648
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:34,760
Like our placement is not safe.

3649
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:35,300
I don't know.

3650
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:37,240
I'm trying to make round two.

3651
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:38,880
I'm trying to play at least eight games today.

3652
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:39,400
Yeah.

3653
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:42,320
I'm trying not to die to UU.

3654
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:43,640
I did cancel plans this weekend.

3655
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:44,540
I'll at least play one day.

3656
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,200
Gas trap, we're good though.

3657
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,220
Oh, you have that turbo charger now, Teba.

3658
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,620
We were here 75 seconds ago.

3659
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:54,260
Can we grab this thingy?

3660
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:55,960
Yeah.

3661
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:57,560
Get the evo cache and then we're gonna Valkylde.

3662
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:58,440
Just come back to me after that.

3663
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,080
I'll wait for you.

3664
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,000
You go grab it then, Tempo.

3665
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,580
We're gonna Valkylde immediately.

3666
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:07,620
Here I see people on the hill here.

3667
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,340
I'm not gonna shoot them because...

3668
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:10,360
They're shooting at someone else, right?

3669
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:10,940
Yeah, they are.

3670
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:12,320
I'm not gonna shoot them because I don't want...

3671
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:12,740
Oh wait.

3672
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:17,040
Are we Valkylding from where you are?

3673
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:17,980
Yeah, come back to me.

3674
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:18,960
We're gonna Valkylde right when you get here.

3675
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:19,900
Watch our back.

3676
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:21,140
Make sure we're not getting walked up on by level seven.

3677
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:25,340
Yep.

3678
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:26,780
Come here.

3679
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:29,820
Nice, huge for me.

3680
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:30,020
Nice.

3681
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:32,060
Here's for me.

3682
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,720
Are we trying to just go into like...

3683
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,560
We're gonna get through the lava.

3684
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:40,860
There was a team right next to us.

3685
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,060
That was great.

3686
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,580
There's a redeploy.

3687
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:44,260
We're gonna go right here.

3688
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:46,460
Oh they're taking it.

3689
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,000
We can't go there.

3690
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,420
We're taking a redeploy.

3691
01:51:51,420 --> 01:52:21,400
We are going to the left side.

3692
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:22,160
We are in a great spot.

3693
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:22,600
Yay!

3694
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:24,920
This might be the exact same channel I played Rival.

3695
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:26,960
Remember when I told you about the...

3696
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,340
You heard my Twitch Prime stuff, right, Wig?

3697
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:30,260
Yeah, I did.

3698
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:32,760
10 minutes later, I have a hype train on my channel.

3699
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:34,080
Nice!

3700
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:35,760
On my Twitch chat.

3701
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:37,400
Nice.

3702
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:38,960
Where's my hype train, guys?

3703
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:41,020
Guys.

3704
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:44,480
Thanks.

3705
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:46,380
Thanks, guys.

3706
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:49,400
Hey, guys.

3707
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,480
Where's my hype train, dude?

3708
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,580
Guys, Twitch Prime over here.

3709
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:54,500
Twitch Prime over here, guys.

3710
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,940
They used up all the Twitch Prime for their Prime channel.

3711
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:00,960
I need to...

3712
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:02,940
Tempo, can you do this a little bit differently down here?

3713
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:03,640
Can you block the doors?

3714
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:05,760
Holy shit, I fucking cracked him and...

3715
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,240
Yeah, which ones?

3716
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:07,520
Just block both doors.

3717
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:08,140
Yeah, block both doors.

3718
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,240
Well, actually, block the front one.

3719
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:10,720
Block the front one.

3720
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:11,480
Don't block this one.

3721
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:12,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3722
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,080
I broke their fucking gen.

3723
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:16,460
Yeah, fuck them.

3724
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:17,020
Good shit.

3725
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,060
And I cracked them.

3726
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:21,120
I'm going to try to get purple off my Sentinel, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to.

3727
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:21,720
Same.

3728
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,620
I also have a Sentinel.

3729
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:24,020
Yeah, I charged it up.

3730
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,140
I ripped a little bit.

3731
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:26,020
We're in a really good spot.

3732
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:26,340
I'm pretty sure...

3733
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:27,280
Can I play on the penis?

3734
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:30,820
You said, do you want to play on the penis?

3735
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:33,600
Do you want to repeat what you dropped it to you?

3736
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:37,460
I would rather you not play the cock.

3737
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:37,780
No.

3738
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:40,780
Because if you get knocked, then we can't do anything about it.

3739
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:41,160
Yeah, sure.

3740
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:41,160
Yeah.

3741
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:46,140
I think for this zone, I think we should stay up a little bit more locked in.

3742
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:48,440
So, I think teams will start to rotate in a little bit because it was the last game.

3743
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:50,940
So, I think this game is going to be easier for us to play.

3744
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:52,560
Like, correctly, if that makes sense.

3745
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:53,700
Just keep a lookout on the right side.

3746
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:54,160
You're at two temples.

3747
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:55,040
You don't get walked in by all of us.

3748
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:56,320
Yeah, I'm going to look at south side.

3749
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:57,300
That's fine.

3750
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:58,320
I'm going to keep trying to farm up.

3751
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:00,240
I have only 300 or 400 damage off my purple.

3752
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:01,980
I have 500.

3753
01:54:02,540 --> 01:54:03,840
Oh, I closed my chat this whole time.

3754
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:04,440
I had no idea what it was like.

3755
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:05,620
I'm 850.

3756
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:07,380
Where are you guys getting the things?

3757
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:08,220
Or the thing?

3758
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:08,920
What?

3759
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:09,760
What?

3760
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,460
Did you just say?

3761
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:11,840
I was shooting people.

3762
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,200
I'm 850 away.

3763
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,460
Yeah, I shot people.

3764
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:15,680
Can you guys let me know?

3765
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,540
Can you guys let me know if I die?

3766
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:17,800
Okay, yeah.

3767
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:18,740
Awesome.

3768
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,100
Thank you.

3769
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:19,580
You're dying?

3770
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:20,760
Oh, wait.

3771
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:20,920
What happened?

3772
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:21,120
Actually?

3773
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:21,360
No.

3774
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:22,740
Oh, my God.

3775
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:24,820
I just fucking shit myself, dude.

3776
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:31,120
Actually?

3777
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:33,060
I was like, wait.

3778
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:33,400
Hello?

3779
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,020
That was fast.

3780
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:36,980
I was like, damn.

3781
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,780
I just literally tabbed out for two seconds, guys.

3782
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:40,440
Oh, yo.

3783
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,760
Thanks for the five gifted souls on Twitch, guys.

3784
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:43,220
Thank you.

3785
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:44,660
Yo, what the fuck?

3786
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,180
I'm on level four.

3787
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:47,800
Wait, guys.

3788
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:48,520
Team 11 died.

3789
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:49,520
That's not good for us.

3790
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:54,220
Guys, if you guys didn't know, hype train is now uncapped if it's still going on after 10 minutes.

3791
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:55,520
Yeah, guys.

3792
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:56,360
Over at Twitch.tv.

3793
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,140
Twitch.tv is level zero.

3794
01:54:58,340 --> 01:54:58,480
Yeah.

3795
01:54:59,600 --> 01:54:59,880
Yeah.

3796
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,240
We have no hype train here, guys.

3797
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:02,280
It would be pretty cool if I ever got one.

3798
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:02,840
Never got one before.

3799
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:03,400
Never got one before.

3800
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:12,550
I already used my one phoenix, my one gimme.

3801
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:13,930
Hopefully, a fucking crafter wins near us.

3802
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:15,190
Just keep looking out here for a time.

3803
01:55:15,210 --> 01:55:16,490
You just literally cannot die from here.

3804
01:55:16,570 --> 01:55:17,010
Just make sure.

3805
01:55:17,190 --> 01:55:17,470
Yep.

3806
01:55:17,470 --> 01:55:17,470
I got it.

3807
01:55:17,470 --> 01:55:18,270
You can even get barrels from there if you want.

3808
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:19,350
One team has to make a double now.

3809
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:20,950
They're moving up.

3810
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:21,490
They're moving up towards us.

3811
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:21,850
Right side.

3812
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:23,530
I don't have an idea.

3813
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:24,670
They're going to go RV.

3814
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:25,370
They're going to go RV probably.

3815
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:26,750
If they go RV, we...

3816
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:28,150
I'm running back towards you guys.

3817
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:28,270
Yeah.

3818
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:28,490
You're good.

3819
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:28,650
You're good.

3820
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:28,750
You're good.

3821
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:29,670
They go RV, we kill that.

3822
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:30,310
We went back again.

3823
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:32,110
We've got like 10 nades in this building.

3824
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:33,390
You're good.

3825
01:55:33,730 --> 01:55:34,110
All right.

3826
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:36,930
They can't go in the close RV.

3827
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:37,610
They have to go...

3828
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:38,910
They went down below another house.

3829
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:39,250
We're good.

3830
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:41,670
Oh, they went inside the house.

3831
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:42,090
We're chillin'.

3832
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:43,590
We're gonna find somebody to shoot at.

3833
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:44,670
Nobody's peeking anymore.

3834
01:55:44,910 --> 01:55:45,650
Oh, well, well.

3835
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:46,550
Except for that team.

3836
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:47,330
Here?

3837
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:51,630
I'm gonna waste all my meds.

3838
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:53,310
I really want a crafter to come near us probably.

3839
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:55,510
I have four bats and eight cells.

3840
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:56,210
Oh, you have four bats?

3841
01:55:56,210 --> 01:55:58,110
I have three bats and five cells.

3842
01:55:58,730 --> 01:55:59,170
We're good.

3843
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:01,010
Yeah, we can just share our heals.

3844
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:03,310
Yo, peek me.

3845
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:04,550
How is it not hitting?

3846
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:04,870
What?

3847
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:06,330
How is that not hitting?

3848
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:07,750
Oh, from there.

3849
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:09,310
I was like, where are you gonna shot at?

3850
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:10,970
That's so confused.

3851
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:20,080
Yeah.

3852
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,300
Fuck, I tried to shoot his feet.

3853
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:26,180
I tried to shoot his toes, but he sucked his toes dry.

3854
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:26,780
Whoa!

3855
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:27,980
Whoa!

3856
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:28,860
Whoa!

3857
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:28,960
Whoa!

3858
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:30,420
Relax, guys.

3859
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:31,240
Chill, man.

3860
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,340
No.

3861
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:32,660
Whoa!

3862
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,560
I didn't say that, bro.

3863
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,540
Wait, where did the...

3864
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:38,380
These guys...

3865
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:39,820
These people that were playing under the penis go?

3866
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:41,420
They went inside the...

3867
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:42,480
Where did that Joan go?

3868
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:43,600
Look at that.

3869
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,140
We've got a valkylde.

3870
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:44,480
We gotta go.

3871
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:44,560
It's okay.

3872
01:56:44,860 --> 01:56:45,660
We gotta go now.

3873
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:46,860
What the fuck was that pole?

3874
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:48,280
We're gonna valkylde.

3875
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:48,660
We're gonna valkylde.

3876
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:48,900
Come here.

3877
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:49,180
Come here.

3878
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:49,360
Come here.

3879
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:49,460
Come here.

3880
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:49,640
Come here.

3881
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:51,880
What the fuck was that pole?

3882
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:53,220
Banana phone.

3883
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:55,200
We're going right back to Fragment, baby.

3884
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:56,400
That pole is literally terrible.

3885
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:56,880
All right.

3886
01:56:57,020 --> 01:56:57,420
All right.

3887
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,220
Which Fragment are we pushing?

3888
01:56:58,580 --> 01:56:59,000
We're going...

3889
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,460
Diner would be best.

3890
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:01,120
Diner would be best.

3891
01:57:01,660 --> 01:57:01,940
What?

3892
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:02,620
I don't know what's going to be...

3893
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:03,480
Wait, isn't Diner just...

3894
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:04,820
Don't we want to play a building that...

3895
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:05,100
Oh, wait.

3896
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:05,960
Diner does have doors.

3897
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:06,560
Okay.

3898
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:07,340
Diner has doors, Temba.

3899
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:07,760
Yes, he does.

3900
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:08,300
Good job, buddy.

3901
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:10,720
How did he get in?

3902
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,320
And it didn't have doors.

3903
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:13,020
Okay.

3904
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:14,580
If you're in that building, there's people in...

3905
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,420
I think there's people in that building.

3906
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:16,440
We're gonna land right here.

3907
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:16,740
Land right here.

3908
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:17,060
We're good.

3909
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:18,080
Yeah.

3910
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:18,220
Yeah.

3911
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:21,180
I don't think there's anyone in here.

3912
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:21,500
We're good.

3913
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:22,540
That was close.

3914
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:23,320
We're good.

3915
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:25,940
Diner has doors.

3916
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:27,040
Diner has doors.

3917
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:28,620
A lot of these buildings do have doors.

3918
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:28,900
Correct.

3919
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:29,800
Nice.

3920
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:30,180
Give it a take.

3921
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:35,060
If it now pulls back somehow, I will be very sad and extremely disappointed, but it's all good.

3922
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:35,260
It's life.

3923
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:37,120
Temba, can I have one battery, please, sir?

3924
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:40,100
I dropped that here.

3925
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:40,920
Okay.

3926
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:41,200
Nice.

3927
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:41,540
Oh, wait.

3928
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:42,300
We don't have this floor.

3929
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:42,900
What the fuck?

3930
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,560
No, no, no.

3931
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:44,260
We're gonna...

3932
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:44,940
We'll just play a little bit.

3933
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,000
We'll play a little bit of Spastic right now.

3934
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:46,180
All right.

3935
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:47,460
I mean, I have two shield cells.

3936
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:48,920
Temba, do you have extra shield cells or no?

3937
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,060
I don't have any shield cells.

3938
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:51,480
Okay.

3939
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:52,960
Guys, they're gonna try to push us here.

3940
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:54,320
Let's just stay focused here.

3941
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:55,600
They're gonna try to push us.

3942
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,960
So, we're gonna hold the top side and we're just gonna play on the second floor.

3943
01:57:59,020 --> 01:57:59,880
Second floor is probably up.

3944
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:00,580
All right.

3945
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:02,940
Let me block off as much of this bottom floor as I can.

3946
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,280
Temba, do you have extra shield cells or no?

3947
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:06,320
Yeah.

3948
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:07,000
I have 10.

3949
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:07,420
Yeah.

3950
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:08,020
I have two.

3951
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:09,880
Can you give me just three?

3952
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:11,400
Or two?

3953
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:11,820
Just two.

3954
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:13,340
Oh, wait.

3955
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:13,780
You're right here.

3956
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:15,820
I'm dropping them all here.

3957
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:17,360
I'm dropping an eight.

3958
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:18,360
All right.

3959
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,180
Temba, when you can, can you get more barrels on the second floor?

3960
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:21,400
Just because we're gonna get pushed by...

3961
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:24,060
Just trying to block off all of the first floor.

3962
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:24,640
You're good.

3963
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:24,920
You're good.

3964
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:25,100
You're good.

3965
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:25,120
You're good.

3966
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:29,100
This zone might pull towards no-name, but I'm pretty confident it's gonna go towards us.

3967
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:29,540
We'll see how it goes.

3968
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:30,800
I do...

3969
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:31,460
Oh, I don't have...

3970
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:32,280
Bottom floor is all blocked off.

3971
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:33,320
I'm gonna go top floor now.

3972
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:33,720
Yeah.

3973
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:34,000
Yeah.

3974
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:34,840
Do your thing.

3975
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:35,100
You're good.

3976
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:37,520
I have like 12.

3977
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:39,260
Why do I have eight nades?

3978
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:40,940
Bro, what the fuck?

3979
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:42,160
Why do you have eight nades?

3980
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:42,300
I just pulled.

3981
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:42,700
I just pulled.

3982
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:43,600
It's pretty fucking crazy.

3983
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:44,040
All right.

3984
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:45,620
In 10 seconds, we'll find out.

3985
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,500
We'll see what happens.

3986
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:50,240
I mean, Jesus Christ.

3987
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,040
All I know is...

3988
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:51,440
Seconds.

3989
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:53,940
The rotate got me a charge rifle, so we win.

3990
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:54,700
Okay.

3991
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,160
Okay.

3992
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,320
The zone is getting smaller, so I don't know.

3993
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:00,740
All right.

3994
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:01,060
Well, there we go.

3995
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:02,160
Someone pulls no-name.

3996
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:03,960
It pulled.

3997
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:06,880
We evac tower into like one of the no-name buildings.

3998
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:07,260
Can you...

3999
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:07,600
No.

4000
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:08,140
Can we...

4001
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:10,340
Can you scan this RV here real quick or no?

4002
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,580
I don't know if I can reach it.

4003
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,000
I'll try.

4004
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:13,860
I don't think you can.

4005
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:14,560
All right.

4006
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:15,640
I can reach it.

4007
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:16,560
This team might look ridiculous.

4008
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:17,380
They're leaving or not too.

4009
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:18,240
There's one guy in there.

4010
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:19,320
Okay.

4011
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:22,520
I mean, I don't want to go there early, but I do want to kind of go there.

4012
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,560
Can we break out left side a little bit?

4013
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:25,320
I don't know if there's any way.

4014
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:25,860
I want to...

4015
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:26,600
Let's wait a little bit longer.

4016
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,720
Wait for your next scan and see how it goes.

4017
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:31,400
Because this team behind us on top side, Diner's going to try to fight us.

4018
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:34,300
But I want to try to get to this if we can.

4019
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:35,220
I don't know if we can though.

4020
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,460
We can play inside of the...

4021
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:37,700
Five seconds.

4022
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:38,800
Do you want me to scan the RV again?

4023
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:39,460
Yeah.

4024
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:39,640
Yeah.

4025
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:40,740
You're going to scan RV just yet again.

4026
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:44,020
There's two people there.

4027
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:44,360
There's two people there.

4028
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:44,980
There's two.

4029
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:48,560
But like if we go up there and cost gold, it should be fucking free.

4030
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:50,380
But then the team behind us is going to...

4031
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:51,220
No, I know.

4032
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:52,360
But we're going to have to fight someone.

4033
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:53,860
We're going to have to fight something.

4034
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:55,280
There's no way we get in there for free.

4035
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:58,240
Do we try to run that side and then evac from behind this big ass rock?

4036
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:00,640
No, because there's going to be a team on cliff that's going to probably shoot us out.

4037
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:01,400
There's definitely a team up there.

4038
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:02,620
No, no, no.

4039
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:03,180
The team...

4040
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:05,520
The Watson fence over there, that team moved down.

4041
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,040
I just saw...

4042
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:06,480
I saw them earlier.

4043
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,380
Okay, so we should be fine then.

4044
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:09,640
Yeah, I think we do drift left side then a little bit.

4045
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,060
Let's drift to the left a little bit.

4046
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:11,340
Let's go.

4047
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:16,080
You have Wingman Craver in that cart.

4048
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:17,180
That is like the worst.

4049
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:18,460
I have one bat.

4050
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:20,520
Our luck right now is pretty fucking bad.

4051
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:20,760
Here, here.

4052
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,120
Here's the bat.

4053
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:21,440
Here's the bat.

4054
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:21,660
Here's the bat.

4055
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:23,120
Want me to give you the point?

4056
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:24,860
I can put an evac right now.

4057
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:26,920
I don't even know if we can land anywhere.

4058
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:27,400
Try to evac.

4059
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:27,860
Try to evac.

4060
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:28,160
Let's see.

4061
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:28,500
Okay.

4062
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:30,960
They're double red inside here too.

4063
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:33,340
I mean, we might just be able to land on one of the buildings to be...

4064
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:34,420
If we're getting shot off, just get off.

4065
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:34,940
Okay?

4066
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:35,580
Just keep coming.

4067
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:35,960
Keep going.

4068
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:37,160
Keep following me.

4069
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:38,780
I'm going out of the direction.

4070
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:39,680
We're going to land.

4071
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:40,360
We're going to land for RV.

4072
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:41,460
There's no one in RV right now.

4073
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:41,900
We're going to go RV.

4074
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:42,120
Okay?

4075
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:43,120
Get in there.

4076
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:43,500
Right here.

4077
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:43,960
Right here.

4078
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:44,120
Right here.

4079
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:44,700
This RV right here.

4080
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:46,120
Oh my God.

4081
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:46,880
The door just closed.

4082
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,140
We're good.

4083
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:47,380
We're good.

4084
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:47,520
We're good.

4085
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:47,760
Okay.

4086
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:48,800
Get in here and play my side.

4087
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:49,160
We're chilling.

4088
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:50,700
Do I have my alt?

4089
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:51,460
No, I don't.

4090
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:51,740
Okay.

4091
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:52,300
We're good.

4092
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:52,940
We're in a great spot.

4093
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,080
We're good to go.

4094
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:56,440
Nice.

4095
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:56,800
Good job, guys.

4096
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:57,260
Yeah.

4097
02:00:57,260 --> 02:00:57,440
See?

4098
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:57,800
Look.

4099
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,220
Tempo and I, we did it.

4100
02:00:59,300 --> 02:00:59,800
We helped.

4101
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:00,800
Nice job, guys.

4102
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,040
Big ass head was in my crap way.

4103
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:04,000
Good shit, dude.

4104
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:04,980
All right.

4105
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:06,100
Now we somehow have to...

4106
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:06,720
Yeah.

4107
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,500
Glass side is actually probably better here.

4108
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:10,060
So, we want to stay alive.

4109
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:12,700
Do you want me to scan west side or east side?

4110
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:13,440
What do you want me to scan?

4111
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:13,520
Oh, yeah.

4112
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:13,620
It doesn't matter.

4113
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:14,180
Let's see.

4114
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:14,980
Oh, shit.

4115
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,120
We're good to talk, guys.

4116
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:16,240
We're behind the seat.

4117
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:17,060
Hey, Jones.

4118
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:17,620
Play behind the seats.

4119
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:17,840
We're good.

4120
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:19,580
I'm so safe.

4121
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:20,980
I'm very safe as well.

4122
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:21,240
We're good.

4123
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:23,860
Let's keep putting those barrels down.

4124
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:24,140
We're vibing.

4125
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:24,520
Yeah.

4126
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:26,980
The seats will really help us.

4127
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:27,640
We're in zone to go.

4128
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:28,380
Again, we're good.

4129
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:30,080
We're going to have literally tempo.

4130
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,100
We're going to get more traps on this side of RV.

4131
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:32,380
Okay?

4132
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:33,860
Because we're going to get sent on from this side.

4133
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:37,280
So prioritize any traps and also any in the window up here too.

4134
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,740
If you just put them on top of windows as well, we're good.

4135
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:40,740
And even blocking doorways.

4136
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:41,600
I'm trying to go some light ammo.

4137
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:43,360
Don't be afraid to block doorways.

4138
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,560
I'm going to go inside from where we're good.

4139
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,460
There's like 10 million nades down here, by the way.

4140
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:46,940
One, two, three.

4141
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:47,520
Oh, my God.

4142
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:49,360
We are all just chilling.

4143
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:50,780
Yeah, we're good.

4144
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:52,140
Keep putting more traps down.

4145
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:52,880
I'm cool down on this side.

4146
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:53,540
Yeah.

4147
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:55,680
Somebody used resing.

4148
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,000
What the fuck is resing?

4149
02:01:58,340 --> 02:01:59,620
Bro, this is just like...

4150
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:01,340
These kids just don't stop shooting.

4151
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:02,400
I would just go in and just go in and just go in and just go in and just go in and just go in and just go in and just go in and just go in.

4152
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:02,800
I'm going to take a chill pill.

4153
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:04,360
Guys, guys, please.

4154
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:05,380
Let us live.

4155
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:07,120
Let us live.

4156
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:09,480
Is there any way for me to charge rifle someone?

4157
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:11,400
No.

4158
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:12,240
That sounds this way.

4159
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:12,840
Why not?

4160
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:14,400
Do you guys have any cells?

4161
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:16,560
I can spare two.

4162
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:17,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4163
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:17,700
I saw.

4164
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:18,640
I'll take one.

4165
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:20,000
I can drop two more as well.

4166
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:20,320
OK.

4167
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:20,660
I'm good.

4168
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:21,120
I don't need that many.

4169
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:21,460
You guys are good.

4170
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,280
I'm going to keep them in the southwest side.

4171
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:23,700
You are still good.

4172
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:24,120
I still have more cells.

4173
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:25,320
So- No, you're vibing.

4174
02:02:25,620 --> 02:02:27,300
Why are you booking me?

4175
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:29,480
Why me, man?

4176
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:34,820
This team has to move now.

4177
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:00,760
Yo, we have 10 million nades.

4178
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:04,540
Bro, we're not... we're gonna not have 10 million nades, dude.

4179
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:06,080
Yeah, we probably can't get any nades.

4180
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:07,820
Fuck, it didn't work.

4181
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:09,280
The other team is pushing the way.

4182
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:09,680
I should get it.

4183
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,020
Oh my god, we're just in level 6 hype train.

4184
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:13,580
Thanks, guys!

4185
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:14,440
Right here, right here.

4186
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:15,360
Focus on the side.

4187
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:16,420
Focus on the side right now.

4188
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:17,460
I'm focusing on the side too.

4189
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:18,180
I'm focusing on the side.

4190
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:18,520
Okay, okay.

4191
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,880
Don't be afraid of their ulti if we need to tempo on the south-west side.

4192
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:22,120
You see that to the right here?

4193
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:24,320
There was someone here.

4194
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:25,100
No, you're right.

4195
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,040
They're getting shot.

4196
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:26,680
They're getting shot on top side.

4197
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:27,280
They're getting shot on.

4198
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:29,460
I'm playing outside a little bit to get them.

4199
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:32,320
I'm shooting this team to the north-west.

4200
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:39,200
Bro, this kid is still peeking me inside.

4201
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:39,900
Get a job.

4202
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:41,720
This is his job.

4203
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:43,840
Please.

4204
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:46,100
You horny motherfucker.

4205
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:47,420
Okay.

4206
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:48,100
Got one.

4207
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:48,420
I got a kill.

4208
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:48,780
Nice.

4209
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:53,180
Full knock or... wait, that's not even your trap.

4210
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:54,980
No, it's not.

4211
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,360
I was getting fucking gassed by a different trap.

4212
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:01,140
We're good.

4213
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:02,080
Okay, so we're gonna move left side.

4214
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:03,320
We're gonna go left side rock, okay?

4215
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:04,940
We're gonna break out of your left and move outside.

4216
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:05,480
Oh my god.

4217
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,280
That's your ult.

4218
02:04:07,060 --> 02:04:07,400
We're good.

4219
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:08,660
Are they pushing us?

4220
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:09,740
Yeah, they're pushing us.

4221
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,220
Ult this tempo.

4222
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:11,580
Ult this tempo.

4223
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:12,800
I ulted.

4224
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,760
Last guys to the left.

4225
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:15,820
Last guys to the left.

4226
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:16,760
I can't do anything.

4227
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:17,620
You need to go to crazy or tempo.

4228
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:18,280
Yes, tempo!

4229
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:19,280
Nice.

4230
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:19,600
Good job.

4231
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:20,100
I'm gonna push you.

4232
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:21,280
You're good.

4233
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:21,600
You're good.

4234
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:23,120
You're dead.

4235
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:23,740
You're so dead.

4236
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:24,120
You're dead.

4237
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:24,580
It's fine.

4238
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:25,600
We got second.

4239
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:26,300
Oh, wait.

4240
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:27,260
We got second.

4241
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:28,160
What the fuck happened?

4242
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:29,200
Wait, what the fuck happened?

4243
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:30,260
Wait, what the fuck?

4244
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,460
How did everybody die?

4245
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,260
I was so confused.

4246
02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:34,740
Why they were just there?

4247
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:35,480
I have no idea.

4248
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:36,120
I have no idea.

4249
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:40,320
Wait, there were five teams alive and then all of a sudden there was two.

4250
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:43,680
Well, that's what happens bro, because there's just no one in the lobby to start.

4251
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:44,420
It's so hard to predict.

4252
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:46,520
How many kills did we get?

4253
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:49,000
Oh, shit.

4254
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:50,600
We got second place.

4255
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:54,480
I think we got like three kills or something.

4256
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:55,940
Yeah.

4257
02:04:56,380 --> 02:04:57,180
Good shit, man.

4258
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:58,140
Good shit.

4259
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:03,700
Let's go, baby.

4260
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,720
Oh, we got four kills.

4261
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:06,780
Yeah.

4262
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:08,160
Four kills.

4263
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:08,300
We're in.

4264
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:09,220
Next round.

4265
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:11,540
We're so around too.

4266
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:12,380
Bro, bro.

4267
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:14,280
11 and one got 14 and 13.

4268
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:15,500
What the fuck happened?

4269
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:16,700
I'm telling you right now.

4270
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:18,040
I'm telling you right now, that would be...

4271
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:20,820
I think that lobby is going to be harder than the next one .

4272
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:21,480
I'm not even kidding.

4273
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:22,440
Oh my god.

4274
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:26,260
Thank you to my Twitch chat for giving me a level seven high train.

4275
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:27,360
Let's celebrate.

4276
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:27,700
Oh my god.

4277
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:28,080
Guys.

4278
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,120
Guys.

4279
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:29,840
I still have a level 0 here guys!

4280
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,960
We still have a high train!

4281
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:33,980
Guys, I still have a level 0 guys!

4282
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:38,520
If anyone wants to change that, like I was...

4283
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:42,340
How do you still have a level 0 high train after all that?

4284
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:43,980
That's insane to make fun of your guy.

4285
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,220
Oh shit, even I have a level 5 high train.

4286
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:48,920
I'm just fucking with you.

4287
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:51,800
I was gonna say that's so fucked up bro.

4288
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,800
Why can't I hear my own stream?

4289
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:55,540
Oh shit.

4290
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:58,320
I'm just refreshing the page.

4291
02:05:58,480 --> 02:05:59,140
Come on man.

4292
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:00,900
I mean we definitely qualify for sure.

4293
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:03,620
I just wanna see how high we made it with that.

4294
02:06:03,700 --> 02:06:05,340
Cause if we got second, that's like 9.

4295
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,300
Yo, we finished in 5th place.

4296
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:09,560
Bro, we got 5th!

4297
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:11,300
Alright, how about to our next...

4298
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:14,300
How many minutes till we play round 2?

4299
02:06:14,620 --> 02:06:15,460
How much time?

4300
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,200
Minutes left guys.

4301
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:19,440
I would say...

4302
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,880
I don't know, probably 15.

4303
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,460
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4304
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:23,520
Entertain my chat please.

4305
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:25,380
Alright guys, yo what's the challenge?

4306
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:25,740
Me too.

4307
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:27,620
Our game's not in.

4308
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:30,180
You guys have a sub train over at DokieBurr's chat.

4309
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:32,720
But listen man, Nice Week's chat's pretty rad too.

4310
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:33,760
We don't have a sub train.

4311
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:36,080
So if you guys wanna change that and you know...

4312
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:37,460
Change history.

4313
02:06:37,480 --> 02:06:39,320
Oh you're not gone yet?

4314
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:39,600
My bad.

4315
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:41,160
I mean, guys keep going.

4316
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,300
Dokie should get a level 100.

4317
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:43,080
She deserves that.

4318
02:06:46,050 --> 02:06:47,070
Bro, why can't I...

4319
02:06:47,070 --> 02:06:49,030
Why can't I hear my own stream right now?

4320
02:06:49,090 --> 02:06:49,470
What is going on?

4321
02:06:49,650 --> 02:06:50,290
This is so weird.

4322
02:06:57,450 --> 02:06:58,970
Oh, someone's got dual sense controller.

4323
02:06:59,110 --> 02:06:59,350
What?

4324
02:06:59,530 --> 02:07:00,050
A phone.

4325
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:26,850
I think Valve's gonna be really good for us, bro.

4326
02:07:39,590 --> 02:07:40,670
Alright, we're back.

4327
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:44,130
Let's check the Discord.

4328
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:51,140
Where's the ALDS Discord?

4329
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:54,080
Let's see.

4330
02:08:01,220 --> 02:08:04,820
Okay, challenges record 3, we were lobby 15.

4331
02:08:12,510 --> 02:08:13,630
Any announcements?

4332
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:13,870
Any announcements?

4333
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:24,940
Any announcements?

4334
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:25,360
Any announcements?

4335
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:43,660
I spilled a whole thing of gamer thigh juice or anime thigh juice in my fucking counter.

4336
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:43,900
Wait, again?

4337
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:47,900
No, I spilled it on my fucking desk now.

4338
02:09:02,090 --> 02:09:04,170
I don't know how long we wait.

4339
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:04,950
I don't know how long we wait.

4340
02:09:04,950 --> 02:09:05,610
That was a good game, bro.

4341
02:09:05,670 --> 02:09:06,570
We had to at least shoot our guns.

4342
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:09,690
Agreed.

4343
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:09,970
Agreed.

4344
02:09:10,490 --> 02:09:11,610
That was fun.

4345
02:09:12,330 --> 02:09:13,290
Got some kills.

4346
02:09:14,410 --> 02:09:16,030
I can't believe I didn't recognize the top two.

4347
02:09:16,110 --> 02:09:17,010
That happened so fast.

4348
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:18,230
Yeah, no.

4349
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:20,430
I'm usually so attentive to that.

4350
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:25,970
When I went to the back side of the RV to start shooting people, there was five teams.

4351
02:09:26,130 --> 02:09:28,450
And then when you were like, throw your causticol, then I threw it.

4352
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:30,470
Then all of a sudden there were two teams.

4353
02:09:30,570 --> 02:09:31,890
And I was like, oh, it's already over.

4354
02:09:32,450 --> 02:09:33,590
I couldn't believe that.

4355
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:39,390
If I knew that was two teams alive, I would have swung on the buff side and would have fought across the tracks.

4356
02:09:39,570 --> 02:09:40,690
Because I don't think that was only a duo.

4357
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:42,190
It's insane.

4358
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:43,010
I can't believe that.

4359
02:09:43,050 --> 02:09:44,890
I'm usually so attentive to how many teams are alive.

4360
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:46,750
And I did not believe how fast that went down.

4361
02:09:46,970 --> 02:09:47,370
Chaos.

4362
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:49,230
Literally.

4363
02:09:49,830 --> 02:09:50,270
Okay,

4364
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:59,220
my page is refreshing.

4365
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:00,120
I'm back!

4366
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:00,980
Let's see.

4367
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:02,100
Where are we now?

4368
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:05,440
How long until our next game?

4369
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:07,040
Probably a little while.

4370
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:07,940
A little while?

4371
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:09,520
Yeah, 10.

4372
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:13,940
Because the other lobbies have to finish too.

4373
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:14,580
Oh!

4374
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:17,060
We should warm up.

4375
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:18,360
We can't combine unless...

4376
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:18,920
Warm up!

4377
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:23,860
I'm decently warm to be honest.

4378
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:27,280
But the fact that you're not kind of scares me a little bit.

4379
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:31,100
I hope we're seeing at least more than 40 frames.

4380
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:34,200
Guys, we should totally...

4381
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,240
We should play some trios.

4382
02:10:37,660 --> 02:10:41,820
Thank god this team inside that RV did not hit any wingman shots on us.

4383
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,020
Oh yeah, thank fucking god.

4384
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:43,280
Yeah.

4385
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:45,080
It was so bad for us.

4386
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:46,280
He went like 0 for 7 on us.

4387
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:49,120
This is when we were about to fly into the RV.

4388
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:50,820
And you said RV.

4389
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:52,000
I almost flew into the wrong one.

4390
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:53,840
Oh, wait which one?

4391
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:54,740
Isn't there one RV?

4392
02:10:55,380 --> 02:10:57,460
No, there's one on the other side of the tracks.

4393
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:57,980
Oh!

4394
02:10:58,020 --> 02:11:01,140
And I was like, oh wait there's people there.

4395
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:03,800
Ha ha!

4396
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:05,880
Imagine if you landed across.

4397
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:07,220
Probably would have been so fucked.

4398
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:11,080
We would have died so early if we didn't have a cost to get that RV with you there.

4399
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:12,460
Oh yeah, 100% yeah.

4400
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:13,760
We would have gotten knocked.

4401
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:14,900
We would have been knocked around.

4402
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:17,080
It's like one trio pub.

4403
02:11:17,860 --> 02:11:19,680
I told you guys, I think we're going to make food to be honest.

4404
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:20,340
Oh, you're going to make food?

4405
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:21,420
Alright, Temple get in here.

4406
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:24,340
Where are you?

4407
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:25,760
I invited you, let's go.

4408
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:27,800
Wait, can we leave trios?

4409
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:30,000
And not get a penalty thingy?

4410
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:30,520
Yeah, we can.

4411
02:11:31,420 --> 02:11:32,100
It's a pub.

4412
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:33,040
It's a fucking pub.

4413
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,720
You can't leave Gunrun now, I know that.

4414
02:11:36,820 --> 02:11:37,320
Yeah, you can.

4415
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,040
I literally left my pub.

4416
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:39,560
10 kills.

4417
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:39,980
10 kills.

4418
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,440
What was our final score?

4419
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:45,700
Like our final placement?

4420
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:46,840
Fifth.

4421
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:48,960
Yeah, fifth!

4422
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,560
Two points away from fourth.

4423
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:56,040
I can't believe we got nine points and only went up two placements.

4424
02:11:56,120 --> 02:11:57,020
That's actually crazy.

4425
02:11:57,780 --> 02:11:58,260
Yeah.

4426
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:00,720
Well, don't forget we had a pretty fucking shit third game.

4427
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:01,320
That was pretty ass.

4428
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:01,620
That's true.

4429
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:04,240
Our third game was pretty rough.

4430
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:06,040
Gustav's our third.

4431
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:07,600
Same with our second game.

4432
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:11,560
We went to track across the fucking river of death.

4433
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:12,860
But hey, we survived.

4434
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:14,640
We got top ten every time.

4435
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:15,740
We really did.

4436
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:18,520
Good job guys.

4437
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:19,780
That was fun.

4438
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:22,100
I actually had to shoot my weapon a little bit though.

4439
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:22,520
That was a good time.

4440
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:27,460
I just can't believe how fast that went, the two squads.

4441
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:28,620
I'm kind of sad I didn't recognize that.

4442
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:30,580
I'm watching it back right now.

4443
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:32,100
Yeah, I didn't realize.

4444
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:34,660
Everybody just died so fast.

4445
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,540
Yeah.

4446
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:36,880
There's no reason for that either.

4447
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:37,920
There's a lot of spots that are playable.

4448
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:41,820
I just thought if I knew that was happening, I would have 100% told us to sneak out of the trophy.

4449
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:43,640
Yeah, I saw us die and I was like, second?

4450
02:12:44,460 --> 02:12:44,780
Yeah.

4451
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:48,460
I was like, alright, six of 4kp, we should still make it.

4452
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:50,460
But I saw second and I was like, what the fuck do you mean second?

4453
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:51,760
Yeah, I was like, wait a second?

4454
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:56,000
Alright, I'll be right back real quick.

4455
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,280
Alright, we're playing a pub.

4456
02:12:57,980 --> 02:12:58,580
Go for it.

4457
02:12:59,080 --> 02:12:59,940
Are we doing the same comp?

4458
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:04,820
Are we going to do the same comp where there's actually 20 people at tempo?

4459
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:05,200
Are we going to do the same comp where there's actually 20 people at tempo?

4460
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:07,540
Yes.

4461
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:08,280
Yes?

4462
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:08,580
Alright.

4463
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:11,200
I didn't know that was our actual comp now.

4464
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:13,940
Oh, we got an alternator.

4465
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:17,620
Yay!

4466
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:20,640
There's a gold bag over here.

4467
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:21,960
Got it.

4468
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:23,940
I got so much gold stuff.

4469
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:25,620
I'm golden golden.

4470
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:28,780
Wait, why did I not grab that...

4471
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:30,180
hemlock?

4472
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:30,920
There you go.

4473
02:13:31,940 --> 02:13:33,240
Wait, are you in here with me?

4474
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:34,820
Yes, that's me stealing your loot.

4475
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:36,200
Here, you take that.

4476
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:38,440
I don't know how that gun works.

4477
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:39,580
Did you take the scope?

4478
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:41,500
No, I got scope.

4479
02:13:41,640 --> 02:13:43,140
I think I dropped it over here somewhere.

4480
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:43,600
Yeah.

4481
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:49,120
You don't know how to use the 30-30, but you play sniper.

4482
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:52,260
That's not a 30-30.

4483
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:52,760
That's not a 30-30.

4484
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:54,720
No, you dropped a 30-30.

4485
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:55,460
Yeah, but like...

4486
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:58,040
Oh, no, I mean like, yeah, I don't know how that gun works.

4487
02:13:58,140 --> 02:13:59,040
That gun is confusing.

4488
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:01,060
You lead off like a sniper.

4489
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:02,900
That's too much thinking.

4490
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:05,160
That's too much thinking.

4491
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:06,900
Way too much thinking necessary.

4492
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:12,460
I found another.

4493
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:24,050
I got him.

4494
02:14:24,070 --> 02:14:25,310
Oh, wait, the thing is over there.

4495
02:14:25,570 --> 02:14:26,890
Oh, wait, we don't need that.

4496
02:14:26,890 --> 02:14:27,690
We're playing pubs.

4497
02:14:28,330 --> 02:14:29,030
I have a...

4498
02:14:32,830 --> 02:14:33,910
I hear someone.

4499
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:34,470
I'm going to rat them.

4500
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:37,150
Let's rat them right here.

4501
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:42,340
Wait, I got it.

4502
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:42,500
Ready?

4503
02:14:46,190 --> 02:14:46,510
There.

4504
02:14:48,250 --> 02:14:48,950
We're going to bait that.

4505
02:14:51,790 --> 02:14:53,650
They're going to come grab this and then we're going to kill them.

4506
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:55,930
Oh, wait, they went into the ring.

4507
02:14:56,190 --> 02:14:56,810
They went to the ring.

4508
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:57,570
Yoink.

4509
02:14:58,230 --> 02:14:58,950
Yo, what the fuck?

4510
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:02,490
They're on me.

4511
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:03,030
They're on me.

4512
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:04,410
They're on me.

4513
02:15:04,690 --> 02:15:07,210
Yo, let's go in and punch his ass out.

4514
02:15:07,430 --> 02:15:07,730
Let's go.

4515
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:08,730
Fuck that guy.

4516
02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:10,990
Where's his teammate?

4517
02:15:10,990 --> 02:15:11,190
I fucking ran.

4518
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:13,170
Where's his teammate though?

4519
02:15:16,330 --> 02:15:16,770
Hey.

4520
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:20,770
Fuck him up.

4521
02:15:20,850 --> 02:15:21,930
I don't know where his teammate is.

4522
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:23,530
Why you don't ball him in the face?

4523
02:15:24,230 --> 02:15:25,250
He balled you.

4524
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:30,500
Oh, there's his teammate.

4525
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:38,620
No, I went climbing into the ring.

4526
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:39,460
I couldn't.

4527
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:42,180
Oh, that's ballsy.

4528
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:47,140
That fucking guy is crazy, man.

4529
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:50,340
That guy is like over here.

4530
02:15:50,660 --> 02:15:51,100
Yeah.

4531
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:53,280
He's over here.

4532
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:54,800
I'm going to crawl you.

4533
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:56,120
That's where the last guy is.

4534
02:16:00,130 --> 02:16:02,010
Oh, that bomb could give you a shield.

4535
02:16:02,370 --> 02:16:03,150
He's pushing in.

4536
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:03,830
Left side.

4537
02:16:04,230 --> 02:16:04,670
Oh.

4538
02:16:06,490 --> 02:16:09,050
Alright, let me refresh this.

4539
02:16:11,990 --> 02:16:13,010
Oh, it's out.

4540
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:13,750
Oh, it's out.

4541
02:16:14,030 --> 02:16:14,470
Alright, let's go.

4542
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:15,870
We got our new lobby.

4543
02:16:16,230 --> 02:16:16,850
Oh, no.

4544
02:16:17,730 --> 02:16:18,090
Why?

4545
02:16:18,090 --> 02:16:18,930
Why are you saying oh no?

4546
02:16:19,710 --> 02:16:20,630
He's not back yet.

4547
02:16:21,250 --> 02:16:21,930
Bro, wait.

4548
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:23,110
I swear I thought I heard him.

4549
02:16:24,610 --> 02:16:25,170
He's not back.

4550
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:32,020
Did you guys put the code in?

4551
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:33,360
No, no, no.

4552
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:33,660
Alright.

4553
02:16:35,420 --> 02:16:37,300
Alright, this one might be a little difficult.

4554
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:38,900
Oh, why?

4555
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:39,660
Why?

4556
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:41,860
We have like five teams I recognize.

4557
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:42,620
Oh.

4558
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:44,880
Oh, no.

4559
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:48,200
Alright, let me go into the ALJS Discord.

4560
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:50,140
And what group are we in?

4561
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:51,420
Group eight.

4562
02:16:57,390 --> 02:17:01,130
Uh, code is coming out here in a sec.

4563
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:11,550
Oh, man.

4564
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:18,680
Okay, code is out.

4565
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:20,360
I wait.

4566
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,120
Don't you?

4567
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:24,220
What?

4568
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:25,820
Are you telling me to wait?

4569
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:28,720
Are you telling me that your level 10 hype train is offline?

4570
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:30,460
Yeah.

4571
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:31,200
Wait, what?

4572
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:34,540
Wait, she's offline?

4573
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:36,620
No, I'm on YouTube.

4574
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:39,260
Wait, why?

4575
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:39,860
What?

4576
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:43,880
I thought you were streaming on Twitch too.

4577
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:46,640
I would have reacted way crazier if I knew it was fucking offline.

4578
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:48,720
What the fuck?

4579
02:17:49,020 --> 02:17:49,860
But yeah.

4580
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:50,660
What do you mean?

4581
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:51,800
I'm opening stream.

4582
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:53,060
No, it's not.

4583
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:53,780
It ended.

4584
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:58,340
I'm trying to make my fucking green super greens drink.

4585
02:17:58,520 --> 02:17:59,700
Uh, we got a two and we're going.

4586
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:00,100
Right?

4587
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:02,360
Yeah.

4588
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:04,120
You didn't realize it was offline?

4589
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,720
No, why would you let 10 hype train offline?

4590
02:18:06,980 --> 02:18:07,600
Only you do that.

4591
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:08,160
I did.

4592
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:10,000
Yeah, of course you did.

4593
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:10,540
Only you.

4594
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:14,020
There's only one in the world that would.

4595
02:18:15,560 --> 02:18:17,720
I can't believe you didn't notice.

4596
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:19,520
Of course I didn't say.

4597
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:21,860
Okay, wait.

4598
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:22,820
Where are we going for this one?

4599
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:25,500
I'm trying to figure out where people are going.

4600
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:28,260
I'll make my drink that I need after this game.

4601
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:28,480
It's fine.

4602
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:30,720
I've been taking a probiotic with like these.

4603
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:31,340
What team are we?

4604
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:31,800
Are we team 19?

4605
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:32,860
Yeah.

4606
02:18:33,180 --> 02:18:35,600
Wait, even I recognize some people.

4607
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:36,960
We should definitely call.

4608
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,160
We should definitely go immediately and say something.

4609
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:40,760
World's Edge first.

4610
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:41,920
Let's say we're going.

4611
02:18:43,180 --> 02:18:45,060
I mean, Monument's not bad, to be honest.

4612
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:46,060
Monument would be pretty good for us.

4613
02:18:46,580 --> 02:18:48,160
Easy rotations out of Monument.

4614
02:18:48,260 --> 02:18:48,300
Okay, ready.

4615
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:51,180
Harvester.

4616
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:54,500
Bomb pod.

4617
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:00,070
Countdown.

4618
02:19:00,070 --> 02:19:00,830
Anyone Countdown?

4619
02:19:01,710 --> 02:19:02,610
There's one team Monument.

4620
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:04,510
Team is already going Monument.

4621
02:19:05,030 --> 02:19:05,810
No one's Countdown.

4622
02:19:05,910 --> 02:19:06,750
I don't see anyone saying Countdown, right?

4623
02:19:07,650 --> 02:19:08,290
Probably West.

4624
02:19:14,730 --> 02:19:15,970
Or you can say Conk.

4625
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:17,730
I don't want to fight off spawn.

4626
02:19:17,930 --> 02:19:19,770
We could, but I really don't want to do that, to be honest.

4627
02:19:19,810 --> 02:19:21,150
Four games and you get...

4628
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:21,250
I'm a Tizer.

4629
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:23,850
I'll rot.

4630
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:28,790
I believe in Architest, but let's just say for some reason we do this.

4631
02:19:28,990 --> 02:19:31,250
We just fucked one of our four games, which is not worth it.

4632
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:34,050
Siphon Mill.

4633
02:19:34,330 --> 02:19:35,710
I'll take Countdown if we can.

4634
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:37,930
Honestly, we might be able to grab Mod Stacks.

4635
02:19:37,950 --> 02:19:38,530
It's still open.

4636
02:19:39,070 --> 02:19:39,250
Oh.

4637
02:19:41,250 --> 02:19:41,970
Thermal Elrond.

4638
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:43,670
I can't lie, bro.

4639
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:44,230
We're going to get fucked.

4640
02:19:44,850 --> 02:19:45,810
I'll just say Stacks Mod.

4641
02:19:47,650 --> 02:19:48,570
I said Stacks Mod.

4642
02:19:48,850 --> 02:19:49,270
Fuck it.

4643
02:19:49,370 --> 02:19:49,730
Harvester.

4644
02:19:50,450 --> 02:19:50,810
Climatizer.

4645
02:19:50,910 --> 02:19:52,110
I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.

4646
02:19:52,930 --> 02:19:53,290
Harvester.

4647
02:19:53,290 --> 02:19:53,650
Northside.

4648
02:19:53,750 --> 02:19:54,030
Monument.

4649
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:54,630
Stacks Mod.

4650
02:19:54,990 --> 02:19:55,290
Fissure.

4651
02:19:56,050 --> 02:19:56,770
Everyone Stacks.

4652
02:20:01,270 --> 02:20:02,010
Thermal Elrond.

4653
02:20:03,070 --> 02:20:03,590
Countdown.

4654
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:04,090
Zeus.

4655
02:20:04,250 --> 02:20:04,770
Fissure.

4656
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:06,050
Siphon Mill.

4657
02:20:07,370 --> 02:20:07,890
Northpad.

4658
02:20:07,970 --> 02:20:08,450
Harvester.

4659
02:20:08,590 --> 02:20:09,070
Fissure.

4660
02:20:09,070 --> 02:20:09,210
Zeus.

4661
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:11,450
Stacks Mod.

4662
02:20:12,750 --> 02:20:13,270
Geyser.

4663
02:20:13,310 --> 02:20:13,830
Dumbbeast.

4664
02:20:15,730 --> 02:20:16,250
Zeus.

4665
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:16,750
Fissure.

4666
02:20:20,370 --> 02:20:23,490
So, no one is... so right now...

4667
02:20:25,410 --> 02:20:29,050
Tree, Launch Site, Dome, Stacks, Mod, it's all open.

4668
02:20:29,170 --> 02:20:30,550
That entire Southside is open.

4669
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:33,110
Okay, wait, call it Stacks Mod for us.

4670
02:20:33,350 --> 02:20:33,790
Yep.

4671
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:38,990
So, that's our...

4672
02:20:38,990 --> 02:20:41,330
Wig just needs to use his...

4673
02:20:43,010 --> 02:20:48,690
use his streaming and bully everyone out and say you'll never be on the watch party ever again.

4674
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:51,630
But that's good, they don't want to get watched.

4675
02:20:51,710 --> 02:20:52,970
They don't want to get the caster curse.

4676
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:55,510
You will never get publicity.

4677
02:20:56,190 --> 02:20:58,170
You will never get publicity.

4678
02:20:59,090 --> 02:21:00,050
That is the craziest thing.

4679
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:04,010
We will never watch your stream if you land on us, so you will never get publicity.

4680
02:21:04,450 --> 02:21:05,010
You would the fuck.

4681
02:21:05,530 --> 02:21:06,910
That's what we threaten people with.

4682
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:09,590
I'm an overseeing eye of Apex Legends, what the fuck.

4683
02:21:09,710 --> 02:21:11,530
You would never get publicity.

4684
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:16,850
There's a lot of really good teams in here, by the way.

4685
02:21:17,010 --> 02:21:17,990
Yeah, we know exactly.

4686
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:19,750
We were talking about it.

4687
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:21,290
Wait, where's the thing?

4688
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:27,930
We got Zone Davis, we got Ferelli and his team, we have EZ Stomps.

4689
02:21:28,030 --> 02:21:28,330
...

4690
02:21:31,210 --> 02:21:35,330
The other team that did really well from our lobby last time, we have Unorganized.

4691
02:21:35,670 --> 02:21:36,110
Okay.

4692
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:38,710
Yeah, so there's like five...

4693
02:21:39,970 --> 02:21:42,310
five, six teams that I recognize.

4694
02:21:42,750 --> 02:21:43,890
Maybe they'll fight each other.

4695
02:21:46,230 --> 02:21:47,870
Maybe they'll fight each other.

4696
02:21:48,090 --> 02:21:48,250
Maybe they'll fight each other.

4697
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:48,650
Cito, Tree.

4698
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:51,270
Alright, so Tree is taken.

4699
02:21:52,810 --> 02:21:55,370
Cito is taken, so we can't land there on Storm Point.

4700
02:21:57,730 --> 02:22:00,030
Honestly, we probably can grab both of them.

4701
02:22:00,030 --> 02:22:00,850
Pylon or Launchpad.

4702
02:22:02,030 --> 02:22:03,610
Still, that's still open.

4703
02:22:05,070 --> 02:22:06,110
Pylon, Launchpad?

4704
02:22:06,490 --> 02:22:07,010
Yeah.

4705
02:22:07,570 --> 02:22:13,230
Okay, so Barometer, Pylon, Launchpad, Devastated, Echo, Coastal, that entire south...

4706
02:22:14,590 --> 02:22:16,210
southeast side is open.

4707
02:22:16,490 --> 02:22:17,010
Okay.

4708
02:22:17,370 --> 02:22:19,110
For Storm Point.

4709
02:22:19,210 --> 02:22:23,370
And then for World's Edge, Launch, Dome, Stacks, Mod, it's all open.

4710
02:22:24,570 --> 02:22:30,330
If someone decides to late go to Stacks or some shit, then we can veer off to Launch.

4711
02:22:30,890 --> 02:22:31,250
Okay.

4712
02:22:31,370 --> 02:22:32,650
Launch Site if we need to.

4713
02:22:33,490 --> 02:22:35,370
Wait, so there's someone going Mod Stacks, potentially?

4714
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:37,810
No, no, no, I'm just saying if someone...

4715
02:22:37,810 --> 02:22:39,250
Oh, someone is going Launch Site.

4716
02:22:39,310 --> 02:22:39,510
Okay.

4717
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:41,590
So yeah, we should have...

4718
02:22:41,590 --> 02:22:43,650
no one should be Mod Stacks and Dome.

4719
02:22:44,070 --> 02:22:44,430
Okay.

4720
02:22:44,470 --> 02:22:45,210
From what I can see.

4721
02:22:46,010 --> 02:22:47,290
But obviously, you never know.

4722
02:22:50,620 --> 02:22:51,520
If we do...

4723
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:57,380
if someone does land on us and we don't want to fight them, we still have staging that's open that we can go to as well.

4724
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:57,600
Yeah.

4725
02:22:58,480 --> 02:22:59,400
Which is not bad.

4726
02:23:01,420 --> 02:23:03,180
Let's just hope people contest each other.

4727
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:04,080
Yeah.

4728
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:07,660
You guys all contest each other and we'll rack up the placement points.

4729
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:10,920
Yeah, we'll just be there chilling in placements.

4730
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:13,940
Oh yeah.

4731
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:15,440
Here we go.

4732
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:17,620
This might be the place where we...

4733
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:18,460
No.

4734
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:21,100
But we still have next week though!

4735
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:22,700
We still have next week!

4736
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:24,460
We still have next week guys.

4737
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:28,460
Don't worry, we're totally gonna get into Pro League guys!

4738
02:23:29,740 --> 02:23:30,180
Obviously.

4739
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:33,780
Yeah, if we get to Pro League, who's gonna watch party?

4740
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,760
I wanna be honest here.

4741
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:36,520
Okay, ready?

4742
02:23:36,660 --> 02:23:43,060
Team 2 is literally just like absolute fucking early round challenge circuit.

4743
02:23:43,300 --> 02:23:45,640
Yeah, so we can just have them run everyone over.

4744
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:46,700
Yeah, that's what I'm about to say.

4745
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:47,740
They're definitely gonna go on a three.

4746
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:51,660
They fall off at the end of every challenge circuit.

4747
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:55,080
They do horrible in finals every time, but they are just early round women.

4748
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:57,280
Run a hype train.

4749
02:23:58,500 --> 02:23:59,300
Oh shit!

4750
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:02,380
Oh my god, Wig!

4751
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:04,240
You're finally on a hype train, Wig!

4752
02:24:04,740 --> 02:24:05,220
Let's go!

4753
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:06,380
You did it!

4754
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:07,780
I knew you could.

4755
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:10,100
It's cause my hype train ended.

4756
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:12,300
Yeah, unfortunately.

4757
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:14,720
So they transferred over to you.

4758
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:15,660
Yeah, they transferred over to mine.

4759
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,260
Oh yeah, I forgot she's not actually doing anything on this channel.

4760
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:20,060
Let me just go to this one.

4761
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:24,380
Oh yeah, she's actually has not even said a word yet.

4762
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:24,920
Oh, actually...

4763
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:27,500
Oh...

4764
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:30,420
Alrighty.

4765
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:33,300
Let's fucking do it, bro.

4766
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:35,400
What are we waiting for?

4767
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:36,640
Start!

4768
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,500
Oh, are they like ready?

4769
02:24:39,740 --> 02:24:40,140
No.

4770
02:24:41,140 --> 02:24:43,920
Alright, so literally just watch out for those two.

4771
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:44,340
That's team two.

4772
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:44,980
No joke.

4773
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:45,240
Team two?

4774
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:45,560
Okay.

4775
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:46,480
Where are they landing?

4776
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:49,240
I have no idea.

4777
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,040
We should definitely, hopefully not be near them though.

4778
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:52,800
They're gonna probably take a really good POI from this.

4779
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:54,040
Okay, Tempo, where are they landing?

4780
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:55,540
Analysis now.

4781
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,720
See, they don't care whenever I say no!

4782
02:24:58,960 --> 02:24:59,880
They don't care!

4783
02:25:00,620 --> 02:25:01,760
Alright, I'm back.

4784
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:03,080
If it was Imperial Howl though, they would care.

4785
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:05,460
Yeah, if it was Wing that said no.

4786
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:08,040
Yeah, they said Doki Bird said no.

4787
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:10,200
And then they listed after I said no.

4788
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:10,960
Doki Bird said no.

4789
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:11,560
Okay, start.

4790
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:14,160
I'm gonna play Valkyrie.

4791
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:15,080
We play the same comp, I think.

4792
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:17,640
So we should have...

4793
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:20,200
Mod stacks and domes should be open.

4794
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:22,080
Yeah.

4795
02:25:22,180 --> 02:25:22,960
But we'll see.

4796
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:25,960
Alright, we'll see what happens.

4797
02:25:26,220 --> 02:25:26,540
100%.

4798
02:25:26,540 --> 02:25:26,940
Let's go guys.

4799
02:25:28,340 --> 02:25:29,600
We got four games, man.

4800
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:30,780
Whatever happens here, happens.

4801
02:25:32,380 --> 02:25:32,860
Let's do it.

4802
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:34,740
I believe in us.

4803
02:25:36,480 --> 02:25:37,100
I do too.

4804
02:25:37,220 --> 02:25:38,760
I think round two will be really hard.

4805
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:44,180
I mean, don't forget, I wanna also point out, there's been really good teams that do not make it past round three.

4806
02:25:44,340 --> 02:25:45,540
So I'm very proud of us already.

4807
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:46,880
I'm very proud of us already.

4808
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:47,440
No joke.

4809
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:47,860
No troll.

4810
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:48,220
Let's go.

4811
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:50,100
Then why did Tempo say we can make it to finals?

4812
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:51,360
Because he's delusional.

4813
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,000
I don't know what's going on.

4814
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:52,700
I think we can make it to finals.

4815
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:53,260
What do you mean?

4816
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:54,540
I think we can.

4817
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:55,340
It's just gonna be hard.

4818
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:57,220
What do you mean delusional?

4819
02:25:58,140 --> 02:26:00,320
So that team right below us should be Geyser.

4820
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:02,800
Wait, there's a team right to our right.

4821
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:04,960
Wait, there is a team here.

4822
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:05,860
Yeah, yeah.

4823
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:08,340
Are those guys going stacks then?

4824
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:11,820
Or do you think they're stretching to launch?

4825
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:12,580
I don't know.

4826
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:13,680
Just stay on me.

4827
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:14,240
Just stay on me.

4828
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:15,800
They're still here.

4829
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:16,720
One's going to mod.

4830
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:18,760
That one team went mod.

4831
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:21,980
Okay, so we go stacks and I think that team is stretching to double.

4832
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:23,120
I think so as well.

4833
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:24,700
Yeah, they are there.

4834
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:25,960
That's fine.

4835
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:26,740
Just land together here.

4836
02:26:27,060 --> 02:26:27,720
We should be okay.

4837
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:28,300
This team is leaving.

4838
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:30,900
I'll get the back side then.

4839
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:32,720
That kind of fucking sucks bro.

4840
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:33,720
Why are these guys taking our team?

4841
02:26:34,380 --> 02:26:34,820
It's fine.

4842
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:36,200
They probably didn't want to contest.

4843
02:26:36,620 --> 02:26:39,520
I gotta be honest but I respect them not fighting us instead and just going to mod.

4844
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:40,180
It's a good call.

4845
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:41,780
I would have done the same thing.

4846
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:44,000
Alright, one team dead.

4847
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:44,400
Here we go.

4848
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:44,820
Nice.

4849
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:45,140
Not last.

4850
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:48,140
Not last place.

4851
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:49,720
I'll take that all day.

4852
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:52,440
You're fucking go baby.

4853
02:26:52,460 --> 02:26:52,680
Me too.

4854
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:53,680
I'm happy not last.

4855
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:56,280
Let's go baby.

4856
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:57,260
Huge win.

4857
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:00,120
Alright, so let's see how this goes though man.

4858
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:04,660
We should realistically here in this situation we...

4859
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:06,240
Let me see real quick.

4860
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:06,540
One sec.

4861
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:09,300
We should be able to get to Mirage.

4862
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:11,440
I think it's going to be Mirage slash staging if I had to be real.

4863
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:13,540
So we should be able to move quick.

4864
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:15,180
We definitely want to navigate like...

4865
02:27:15,180 --> 02:27:18,860
Let me scan this beacon while dome is not looking at me.

4866
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:20,440
We have ring scan too.

4867
02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:21,180
Yeah.

4868
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:22,600
This is going to be really big for us.

4869
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:23,900
This ring console should help us in time.

4870
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:26,280
It's right there.

4871
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:28,360
Okay, there we go.

4872
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:29,100
It's going to be a lot of fishers down.

4873
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:31,520
It's not an easy rotate for us but we can do it.

4874
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:31,940
For sure.

4875
02:27:32,420 --> 02:27:33,080
Still possible.

4876
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:37,660
I am looking...

4877
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:38,540
I'm like...

4878
02:27:38,540 --> 02:27:40,620
I'm the best?

4879
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:45,560
Also let's just watch out for mod to push us or do some stupid shit.

4880
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:48,240
No offense, they do know it's us.

4881
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:51,040
And respectfully, people probably do want to push us.

4882
02:27:51,260 --> 02:27:52,980
Should I do the...

4883
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:54,640
Do the...

4884
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:54,940
Yeah.

4885
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:57,480
Yeah, if you think you're safe right now for sure.

4886
02:27:57,580 --> 02:28:00,520
I can come up and body block for you if you need first.

4887
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:02,480
Let's see.

4888
02:28:07,410 --> 02:28:08,050
I'm doing it?

4889
02:28:08,510 --> 02:28:09,250
Yeah, go for it.

4890
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:11,250
Blue backpack here by the way.

4891
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:12,290
I'll need that.

4892
02:28:15,890 --> 02:28:16,570
Oh, they're gone.

4893
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:19,110
That's a really fast rotate.

4894
02:28:19,110 --> 02:28:20,270
Okay, then we can go to...

4895
02:28:20,270 --> 02:28:23,230
We can go mod and then grab their...

4896
02:28:23,230 --> 02:28:24,930
Before I hit the LHL?

4897
02:28:24,990 --> 02:28:25,430
Yeah, we should.

4898
02:28:25,510 --> 02:28:26,390
We should get the EO.

4899
02:28:26,430 --> 02:28:27,710
I'm gonna grab the Evo right now.

4900
02:28:28,030 --> 02:28:29,230
We should start rotating right now anyway.

4901
02:28:29,410 --> 02:28:31,110
I have four batteries, eight cells.

4902
02:28:31,250 --> 02:28:32,690
I'm actually really good on meds.

4903
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:33,330
To be honest.

4904
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:34,230
Me too.

4905
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:35,510
Perfect.

4906
02:28:41,130 --> 02:28:42,210
Because my ass is broke.

4907
02:28:43,210 --> 02:28:44,510
Do we want to take the replay?

4908
02:28:45,310 --> 02:28:46,250
Yeah, we do for sure.

4909
02:28:46,490 --> 02:28:47,290
I'll wait for you.

4910
02:28:48,010 --> 02:28:48,550
Yeah, you're good.

4911
02:28:51,330 --> 02:28:53,250
I want to just get... Anyone have evacs or no?

4912
02:28:53,430 --> 02:28:53,950
Do we not get one?

4913
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:55,870
Nope, I didn't grab one.

4914
02:28:56,950 --> 02:28:59,110
We can take this balloon, right?

4915
02:28:59,490 --> 02:29:00,570
Yeah, we should take the balloon for sure.

4916
02:29:01,050 --> 02:29:01,530
Wait, here.

4917
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:02,290
I dropped that.

4918
02:29:03,150 --> 02:29:03,670
Oh, I'm good.

4919
02:29:03,730 --> 02:29:03,810
I'm good.

4920
02:29:03,930 --> 02:29:05,030
I don't have any energy.

4921
02:29:08,450 --> 02:29:08,730
Alrighty.

4922
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:10,010
Where are we heading into?

4923
02:29:10,110 --> 02:29:11,090
We're gonna land over to lava side.

4924
02:29:11,890 --> 02:29:13,210
Lava side can speed us out pretty quick.

4925
02:29:14,250 --> 02:29:16,790
Yeah, we can grab that balloon too, to be honest.

4926
02:29:17,710 --> 02:29:18,630
Yeah, I think we just go there.

4927
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:19,930
And hit another balloon.

4928
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:21,170
Just land on this catapult balloon for now.

4929
02:29:21,570 --> 02:29:21,850
Alright.

4930
02:29:23,310 --> 02:29:26,030
And just scan inside this building and then we'll just hit the balloon.

4931
02:29:27,610 --> 02:29:28,790
There's no one looting this whole side.

4932
02:29:28,990 --> 02:29:30,010
They probably just left already, honestly.

4933
02:29:30,570 --> 02:29:31,250
You want me to scan?

4934
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:33,330
Yeah, scan this front side building and this one.

4935
02:29:34,750 --> 02:29:35,310
Someone rez.

4936
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:36,350
We're good.

4937
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:37,010
Alright, I was hit this balloon.

4938
02:29:37,150 --> 02:29:37,850
Someone did rez.

4939
02:29:38,470 --> 02:29:40,570
Yeah, keep on moving in.

4940
02:29:40,590 --> 02:29:41,410
There's a team right here that we're good.

4941
02:29:41,830 --> 02:29:42,610
We're gonna go left side.

4942
02:29:42,690 --> 02:29:43,230
Just gonna keep over here.

4943
02:29:45,270 --> 02:29:46,530
Keep on moving in left side.

4944
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:49,050
We're gonna hit a Valkyrie probably and try to get in.

4945
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:49,730
Somewhere.

4946
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:52,710
Kind of me on middle side.

4947
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:54,290
We're gonna hit a Valkyrie from here.

4948
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:55,030
Alright.

4949
02:29:56,050 --> 02:29:57,050
Do we need to play or scan?

4950
02:29:57,210 --> 02:29:57,530
Or no?

4951
02:29:58,590 --> 02:29:59,430
Actually, might as well.

4952
02:29:59,550 --> 02:30:00,290
Might as well.

4953
02:30:00,410 --> 02:30:01,150
100% do it.

4954
02:30:01,310 --> 02:30:01,450
Alright.

4955
02:30:02,850 --> 02:30:03,790
Watch that team.

4956
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:06,130
Team behind us over at launch.

4957
02:30:06,190 --> 02:30:06,530
We're good though.

4958
02:30:07,770 --> 02:30:08,090
Nice.

4959
02:30:08,730 --> 02:30:12,390
Alright, I think actually at this point guys, we're pretty...

4960
02:30:12,390 --> 02:30:13,130
Actually, no, we're good.

4961
02:30:13,210 --> 02:30:13,730
This team's leaving.

4962
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:14,630
They're over at the crafting right now.

4963
02:30:15,090 --> 02:30:16,170
We're gonna go to the harvester.

4964
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:16,790
We're gonna go through the harvester.

4965
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:17,630
This team's trolling.

4966
02:30:18,590 --> 02:30:19,450
We're going through harvester.

4967
02:30:19,450 --> 02:30:20,190
We're gonna go back here?

4968
02:30:20,350 --> 02:30:20,670
Backside?

4969
02:30:20,810 --> 02:30:21,850
Yeah, we're gonna go through this way.

4970
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:21,970
Yeah.

4971
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:25,030
We kinda know where this down is going anyway.

4972
02:30:25,130 --> 02:30:26,070
It's gonna go towards lava fissure.

4973
02:30:28,410 --> 02:30:29,670
There's something in front of me kinda though.

4974
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:34,470
Guys, I still don't have a backhive for some reason.

4975
02:30:34,930 --> 02:30:35,470
Wait, what?

4976
02:30:35,570 --> 02:30:36,250
We pinged it.

4977
02:30:38,470 --> 02:30:39,690
Just say how.

4978
02:30:40,730 --> 02:30:41,190
Just say how.

4979
02:30:41,190 --> 02:30:41,650
I bought two.

4980
02:30:41,930 --> 02:30:42,450
It's gold.

4981
02:30:43,390 --> 02:30:44,410
Gonna grab some heavy.

4982
02:30:47,230 --> 02:30:47,530
Nice.

4983
02:30:49,630 --> 02:30:50,570
Wow, that was awful.

4984
02:30:50,690 --> 02:30:51,170
Fuck me.

4985
02:30:51,450 --> 02:30:52,470
What a useless...

4986
02:30:53,710 --> 02:30:54,310
Another one.

4987
02:30:54,750 --> 02:30:55,290
Where do we go?

4988
02:30:55,890 --> 02:30:57,130
We're gonna keep walking through harvester side.

4989
02:30:57,250 --> 02:30:57,510
We're good.

4990
02:30:59,270 --> 02:31:01,170
I have a gold helm for...

4991
02:31:01,930 --> 02:31:03,030
I think you can keep it right now.

4992
02:31:03,090 --> 02:31:03,530
To be honest.

4993
02:31:04,030 --> 02:31:05,330
Actually, give it to Doki right now if you can.

4994
02:31:05,390 --> 02:31:06,210
Take the gold helm, Doki.

4995
02:31:06,490 --> 02:31:06,790
Alright.

4996
02:31:07,990 --> 02:31:09,490
I have also double ulti excels.

4997
02:31:09,510 --> 02:31:10,690
You guys need your ulti late game or anything.

4998
02:31:10,770 --> 02:31:11,810
Yeah, I have an ulti excel too.

4999
02:31:12,050 --> 02:31:12,710
Can we shoot these kids?

5000
02:31:12,770 --> 02:31:13,070
Fuckin' in.

5001
02:31:13,690 --> 02:31:13,990
Okay.

5002
02:31:14,330 --> 02:31:15,930
Oh fuck, I'm reloading my stupid gun.

5003
02:31:16,330 --> 02:31:16,670
It's okay.

5004
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:21,260
Crack one, crack one.

5005
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:21,620
Crack one, crack one.

5006
02:31:22,620 --> 02:31:23,640
One HP over there.

5007
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:25,220
Oh, I missed.

5008
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:26,340
Oh, good.

5009
02:31:27,620 --> 02:31:28,540
He's still behind right here.

5010
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:30,640
I'm gonna try to kill it when they cross.

5011
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:34,820
Can we grab that Evo cache to our back left?

5012
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:37,440
Yeah, go for it.

5013
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:39,680
Is their team on fence though?

5014
02:31:40,460 --> 02:31:42,020
No, they were the team on fence.

5015
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:42,360
They left.

5016
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:43,760
You guys find sniper ammo.

5017
02:31:43,900 --> 02:31:46,920
I'll stay near him just in case.

5018
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:48,920
Oh, there's people.

5019
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:49,400
There is people.

5020
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:50,160
We're good.

5021
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:50,440
We're good.

5022
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:54,000
I'm trying to look for you, but they're far.

5023
02:31:54,700 --> 02:31:56,300
Yeah, just keep going back to my side guys.

5024
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:56,580
We're good.

5025
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:58,520
We're gonna move through harvester then.

5026
02:31:58,620 --> 02:31:59,300
Fuck the Evo cache.

5027
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:01,140
Yeah, we can't.

5028
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:01,440
It's all good.

5029
02:32:01,900 --> 02:32:02,400
No worries.

5030
02:32:03,140 --> 02:32:05,120
That was the team that was over in tree.

5031
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:07,340
They got stuck from the team top highway, so they just rotated in.

5032
02:32:07,400 --> 02:32:07,720
It's all good.

5033
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:09,260
Really?

5034
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:11,060
We're valid.

5035
02:32:11,620 --> 02:32:13,740
I feel like we're a little late.

5036
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:16,700
We definitely got stalled out.

5037
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:17,600
I mean, stats modern.

5038
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:18,380
We're gonna be late.

5039
02:32:18,460 --> 02:32:20,460
We should probably go and actually get this Evo cache right here.

5040
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:21,620
To be honest.

5041
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:23,100
And then we'll go in from there.

5042
02:32:23,180 --> 02:32:23,700
We can make a play.

5043
02:32:23,800 --> 02:32:25,380
I am two and sixteen.

5044
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:27,560
Scan up just in case.

5045
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:28,720
Yeah, you're valid.

5046
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:29,320
Nice.

5047
02:32:30,020 --> 02:32:30,740
Are we safe?

5048
02:32:31,580 --> 02:32:32,300
Yeah, we're safe.

5049
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:32,900
We're good, dude.

5050
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:34,880
I also need some charge rifle ammo.

5051
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:38,240
If anyone sees a .33, let me know.

5052
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:39,340
Gotcha.

5053
02:32:39,440 --> 02:32:40,240
I'll keep a lookout.

5054
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:41,940
Ooh, evac tower.

5055
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:42,280
Nice.

5056
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:43,000
Nice.

5057
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:44,560
That's huge for us, actually.

5058
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:46,300
That means one team has three evacs somewhere.

5059
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:48,260
Yeah, actually, though.

5060
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:50,340
Alright, we're gonna keep on walking in.

5061
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:53,160
We're gonna get height on this rock here, and we're gonna hit the Evo cache, and we'll go in from there.

5062
02:32:54,980 --> 02:32:56,500
I'm gonna take the height...

5063
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:57,980
It looks like five seconds behind us.

5064
02:32:58,520 --> 02:32:59,080
Yeah, you're good.

5065
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:02,120
I'm gonna take the height of this, and then one of you guys goes get the Evo cache.

5066
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:02,420
Yeah, I'll get it.

5067
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:03,840
Yeah, you're valid.

5068
02:33:04,220 --> 02:33:04,780
I'm looking over.

5069
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:06,080
I'm gonna scan just in case.

5070
02:33:07,580 --> 02:33:08,100
Yeah, why not?

5071
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:09,300
We're gonna go through landslide?

5072
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:10,200
No, no, no.

5073
02:33:10,240 --> 02:33:10,800
We're gonna go through staging.

5074
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:11,220
For sure.

5075
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:12,300
I am...

5076
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:13,460
They're just flying in.

5077
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:14,000
Flying in above us.

5078
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:15,000
They're going tunnel side.

5079
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:15,520
Yep.

5080
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:16,180
Landed on my height.

5081
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:16,560
Landed on my height.

5082
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:17,460
Landed on you.

5083
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:17,980
They landed on you.

5084
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:18,840
Yeah, yeah.

5085
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:20,160
We're gonna fall right down.

5086
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:20,600
We're gonna go down.

5087
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:21,460
There is... T-Mates are here.

5088
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:22,300
T-Mates are here, too.

5089
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:22,960
Come down.

5090
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:23,440
Come down.

5091
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:24,340
Come down to landslide if you can.

5092
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:25,660
We have no smoke.

5093
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:26,020
Don't forget.

5094
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:26,600
Just try to stay alive.

5095
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:28,160
Oh, I got deadslide.

5096
02:33:28,200 --> 02:33:28,400
No!

5097
02:33:29,100 --> 02:33:29,580
You're good.

5098
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:29,660
You're good.

5099
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:29,760
You're good.

5100
02:33:30,020 --> 02:33:30,380
Keep going.

5101
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:30,560
Keep going.

5102
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:30,880
Oh, my god.

5103
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:31,700
I got deadslide there.

5104
02:33:31,700 --> 02:33:31,960
They're pushing hard.

5105
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:33,060
They're sending us.

5106
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:33,220
They're sending us.

5107
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:33,400
They're sending us.

5108
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:33,720
Okay, okay.

5109
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:35,320
I cracked them.

5110
02:33:35,380 --> 02:33:35,820
I cracked them.

5111
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:36,160
Nice.

5112
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:36,400
Nice.

5113
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:36,580
Nice.

5114
02:33:36,580 --> 02:33:37,460
Full heal, Temple.

5115
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:38,400
Can you ult the frontside, Temple?

5116
02:33:38,660 --> 02:33:39,520
On our height, too.

5117
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:40,440
I'm batting.

5118
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:40,700
I'm batting.

5119
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:41,000
I'm batting.

5120
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:41,460
Keep going.

5121
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:42,000
Keep going through tunnels.

5122
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:42,460
Keep going through tunnels.

5123
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:43,560
Oh, I don't think Temple's dead.

5124
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:44,080
I don't think Temple's dead.

5125
02:33:44,260 --> 02:33:45,220
I'm dead, too.

5126
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:45,800
Just keep running, Ducky.

5127
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:46,060
Turn away.

5128
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:46,980
I'm just gonna ult here.

5129
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:49,560
What a bunch of fucking idiots, man.

5130
02:33:51,400 --> 02:33:52,620
Why are they doing that?

5131
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:57,300
I would just honestly, honestly, Ducky, wrap through the landslide tunnel on the right if you can.

5132
02:33:57,620 --> 02:33:59,780
And then maybe I might go back around if you can.

5133
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:00,100
Yeah.

5134
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:01,580
I'm trying to get our banners.

5135
02:34:01,820 --> 02:34:01,840
Okay.

5136
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:03,040
They both have banners, but it's all good.

5137
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:06,100
I guarantee that's Pharrell and the boys.

5138
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:08,500
Do we... I rat here and then come back?

5139
02:34:09,340 --> 02:34:10,280
Um, you could, yeah.

5140
02:34:10,380 --> 02:34:11,620
Or do you want me to go all around?

5141
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:14,060
I don't know if you have time to go all the way around.

5142
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:15,040
You don't have an evac, right?

5143
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:16,380
Uh, no, I don't.

5144
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:17,660
I would wait then here.

5145
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:19,040
I'd just literally rat here and then go.

5146
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:20,300
Like, maybe 30 seconds.

5147
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:21,960
Let me know when to go.

5148
02:34:22,220 --> 02:34:22,980
Do you have meds?

5149
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:23,720
I do.

5150
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:25,080
Yeah, you should be fine.

5151
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:27,420
And then you can res us over in the staging side.

5152
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:28,440
Like the crack house over there.

5153
02:34:28,820 --> 02:34:29,460
Oh, okay.

5154
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:31,940
I have like...

5155
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:34,960
I have like three syringes, one phoenix kit.

5156
02:34:35,180 --> 02:34:36,380
Let me know when I should go now.

5157
02:34:36,580 --> 02:34:36,920
Actually.

5158
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:38,540
I would actually start moving now.

5159
02:34:38,660 --> 02:34:39,820
Yeah, you guys are timed.

5160
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:41,100
Yeah.

5161
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:42,260
Only 40 seconds left.

5162
02:34:42,420 --> 02:34:43,280
There's an evac behind you.

5163
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:43,660
You're good though.

5164
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:46,200
If these kids are routing it, then there's not much to say, to be honest.

5165
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:47,680
No!

5166
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:50,100
Really unfortunate timing though, huh?

5167
02:34:50,180 --> 02:34:50,700
Holy fuck.

5168
02:34:57,800 --> 02:34:59,880
I mean, if there's none here, you definitely get our banner though.

5169
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:00,220
You're good.

5170
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:02,120
Just really depends if they're routing it or not.

5171
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:04,280
And I think you go res in that shack.

5172
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:05,580
You know the house I'm talking about, right?

5173
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:06,060
Yeah.

5174
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:07,620
Okay, cool.

5175
02:35:08,460 --> 02:35:08,740
Nice.

5176
02:35:08,740 --> 02:35:09,720
We can go to our loot too.

5177
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:11,000
We're gonna have a valk ulti as well.

5178
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:11,640
I have an ulti.

5179
02:35:11,740 --> 02:35:11,960
I'm gonna see if we can.

5180
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:12,840
I know you have...

5181
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:14,540
I'm gonna grab some of the meds too.

5182
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:15,500
They took the leaf back.

5183
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:15,660
Yeah.

5184
02:35:15,740 --> 02:35:16,600
Get the med kits if you need.

5185
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:17,040
It's all good.

5186
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:17,300
No worries.

5187
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:18,540
Alright.

5188
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:20,360
Go hit that res above us if you want.

5189
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:21,780
Not that one.

5190
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:22,380
The left side one.

5191
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:22,820
The left side?

5192
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:23,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5193
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:25,220
Yeah, the one that's like that little house.

5194
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:26,320
The one in the house.

5195
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:26,680
You know what I'm talking about.

5196
02:35:27,780 --> 02:35:29,880
Just cause we don't wanna fucking immediately get sent on.

5197
02:35:31,100 --> 02:35:32,640
And then we can go into staging.

5198
02:35:32,780 --> 02:35:34,740
Probably scan that beacon to see where to go next.

5199
02:35:34,980 --> 02:35:35,580
Do we get a point?

5200
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,000
For being top 15?

5201
02:35:37,580 --> 02:35:38,760
Yeah, we do get a point, which is good.

5202
02:35:38,820 --> 02:35:39,140
That's fine.

5203
02:35:39,260 --> 02:35:39,680
That's great.

5204
02:35:40,140 --> 02:35:41,960
Wow, I can't believe they landed on my height and that's just...

5205
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:42,380
That's a good situation, man.

5206
02:35:42,660 --> 02:35:44,260
Hit a free rotate in the landslide tunnel.

5207
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:45,540
Right over us.

5208
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:46,980
Probably thought you were solo.

5209
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:48,380
Or at least a duo.

5210
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:50,380
Cause they did... They definitely did not trigger me.

5211
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:52,940
I think they're like... They're just super confident in team fights.

5212
02:35:53,060 --> 02:35:53,480
I think so too.

5213
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:55,200
I think that was the really aggressive squad.

5214
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:55,640
I'm pretty sure.

5215
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:58,920
I mean, if you wanna scope out the scenes, Doki, you can go to the front of staging.

5216
02:35:59,160 --> 02:35:59,900
I'm gonna look for you right now.

5217
02:36:00,140 --> 02:36:00,980
No one's in staging.

5218
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:01,900
We should probably just get there.

5219
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:02,300
To be honest.

5220
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:02,820
Alright.

5221
02:36:02,820 --> 02:36:03,420
Just go to staging?

5222
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:04,500
Like bottom side?

5223
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:05,140
Yeah.

5224
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:05,800
Just go bottom.

5225
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:07,800
You can definitely get a glass if you need to.

5226
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:10,660
I'm gonna go bottom side now then.

5227
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:11,960
Cause I don't have that many meds.

5228
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:13,020
Yeah, you're good.

5229
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:13,520
Do your thing.

5230
02:36:13,640 --> 02:36:14,640
I'm not gonna go get a loot time.

5231
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:15,300
But we probably can't.

5232
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:15,460
Sadly.

5233
02:36:15,580 --> 02:36:15,760
Yeah.

5234
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:17,740
I'm right behind you.

5235
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:20,220
Still only have two med kit... two syringes.

5236
02:36:21,340 --> 02:36:21,620
Damn.

5237
02:36:22,220 --> 02:36:23,140
I had good loot too.

5238
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:23,320
Bruh.

5239
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:23,620
That sucks.

5240
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:25,960
I tried, right?

5241
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:27,260
I know, man.

5242
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:28,520
Also, my ulti excels.

5243
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:29,520
I'm not gonna have an ulti or an evac.

5244
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:30,680
I can give you an ulti, though.

5245
02:36:31,440 --> 02:36:31,720
Yeah.

5246
02:36:31,820 --> 02:36:32,500
We probably should.

5247
02:36:32,580 --> 02:36:34,020
Cause I think my ulti is gonna be super important here.

5248
02:36:34,620 --> 02:36:36,000
Just gonna get in the zone and see what's good right now.

5249
02:36:36,300 --> 02:36:36,580
Oh.

5250
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:37,480
Am I gonna die from this?

5251
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:38,720
I think I might die from the zone.

5252
02:36:39,980 --> 02:36:40,260
Alright.

5253
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:41,240
Don't show too much presence here.

5254
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:41,960
Just play it safe.

5255
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:42,760
Yeah.

5256
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:44,380
I dropped my ulti.

5257
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:44,620
Yeah.

5258
02:36:44,620 --> 02:36:44,620
I dropped my ulti here.

5259
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:46,520
I'm just being skinny.

5260
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:47,360
Yeah.

5261
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:47,360
We're gonna take this.

5262
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:47,400
Yeah.

5263
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:47,680
You're good.

5264
02:36:47,740 --> 02:36:48,000
Do your thing.

5265
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:49,080
I'm gonna pop this ulti.

5266
02:36:49,220 --> 02:36:50,640
We're gonna try to fly in somewhere, guys.

5267
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:50,840
Alright?

5268
02:36:50,940 --> 02:36:51,440
That's gonna be the play.

5269
02:36:52,180 --> 02:36:53,960
I should scan beacon, right?

5270
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:55,040
Yeah.

5271
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:55,580
If you can.

5272
02:36:55,820 --> 02:36:56,060
Sure.

5273
02:37:00,130 --> 02:37:00,430
Let's see.

5274
02:37:01,550 --> 02:37:02,850
Do you guys need syringes?

5275
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:03,670
Cause I can give you guys one.

5276
02:37:04,070 --> 02:37:05,310
We're gonna play... No.

5277
02:37:05,370 --> 02:37:05,570
It's fine.

5278
02:37:05,630 --> 02:37:06,010
I'll take one.

5279
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:06,190
Yeah.

5280
02:37:06,510 --> 02:37:07,530
We're gonna drop down.

5281
02:37:07,690 --> 02:37:09,290
We're gonna... We're gonna... Valkylde from down below.

5282
02:37:09,350 --> 02:37:10,310
Actually, we can do it up here.

5283
02:37:10,370 --> 02:37:10,750
We can do it up here.

5284
02:37:11,310 --> 02:37:11,550
Alright.

5285
02:37:11,610 --> 02:37:12,630
We're gonna wait 30 seconds, though.

5286
02:37:12,650 --> 02:37:13,610
We have to wait for my percentage to get there.

5287
02:37:13,630 --> 02:37:13,730
We can get up.

5288
02:37:13,810 --> 02:37:14,910
Just play small here for right now.

5289
02:37:14,930 --> 02:37:17,270
We have 30 seconds left.

5290
02:37:17,710 --> 02:37:19,450
I think I'm gonna get my ulti by the time, though.

5291
02:37:19,710 --> 02:37:20,450
By the time the zone closes.

5292
02:37:21,130 --> 02:37:21,910
I hope so.

5293
02:37:22,750 --> 02:37:23,530
I mean, I hope so, too.

5294
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:24,570
Cause then we definitely don't get to the zone.

5295
02:37:24,610 --> 02:37:25,290
Keep moving towards me, guys.

5296
02:37:25,450 --> 02:37:25,730
Yeah.

5297
02:37:26,810 --> 02:37:27,090
Yeah.

5298
02:37:27,090 --> 02:37:27,130
Yeah.

5299
02:37:27,130 --> 02:37:27,190
Yeah.

5300
02:37:27,210 --> 02:37:27,210
Yeah.

5301
02:37:27,210 --> 02:37:28,350
Fighting on that side.

5302
02:37:28,450 --> 02:37:31,330
If we can somehow land in that fissure building...

5303
02:37:31,810 --> 02:37:32,910
I wanna try to get RV.

5304
02:37:33,130 --> 02:37:33,510
You know what I mean?

5305
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:33,830
Down here.

5306
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:34,150
Oh, okay.

5307
02:37:35,370 --> 02:37:36,390
RV looks great, too.

5308
02:37:36,470 --> 02:37:36,470
Okay.

5309
02:37:37,350 --> 02:37:38,570
I just don't know if we can get there.

5310
02:37:38,710 --> 02:37:40,090
The team above us is gonna be a real problem.

5311
02:37:41,570 --> 02:37:41,850
Alright.

5312
02:37:41,850 --> 02:37:43,450
We're gonna make a play here, guys.

5313
02:37:43,630 --> 02:37:44,310
I don't really know what to do.

5314
02:37:44,350 --> 02:37:44,450
Wait.

5315
02:37:44,450 --> 02:37:44,530
Wait.

5316
02:37:44,750 --> 02:37:46,290
You know you can back off from here, right?

5317
02:37:46,910 --> 02:37:47,110
Where?

5318
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:47,290
There?

5319
02:37:47,390 --> 02:37:47,530
Okay.

5320
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:48,050
Yeah.

5321
02:37:48,070 --> 02:37:48,170
Yeah.

5322
02:37:48,170 --> 02:37:48,390
Then wait.

5323
02:37:48,430 --> 02:37:48,790
Then wait for it.

5324
02:37:48,890 --> 02:37:48,950
Yeah.

5325
02:37:49,030 --> 02:37:49,090
Yeah.

5326
02:37:49,090 --> 02:37:49,470
I think you can.

5327
02:37:49,530 --> 02:37:49,810
I think you can.

5328
02:37:49,890 --> 02:37:50,450
Wait for it, then.

5329
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:50,790
Wait for it.

5330
02:37:50,990 --> 02:37:51,710
Can you, though?

5331
02:37:52,150 --> 02:37:52,570
I don't know.

5332
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:54,790
If not, if not, we can just play underneath here.

5333
02:37:54,830 --> 02:37:54,990
Okay.

5334
02:37:55,050 --> 02:37:55,250
Okay.

5335
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:55,390
Okay.

5336
02:37:55,390 --> 02:37:55,570
Yeah.

5337
02:37:56,190 --> 02:37:56,610
Should be fine.

5338
02:37:57,150 --> 02:37:57,390
What's that?

5339
02:37:57,470 --> 02:37:57,830
We're just gonna wait.

5340
02:37:57,830 --> 02:37:58,350
We'll figure it out soon.

5341
02:37:59,110 --> 02:37:59,310
Alright.

5342
02:37:59,370 --> 02:38:01,150
Well, I mean, this is our Hail Mary, so let's hope we get up.

5343
02:38:01,170 --> 02:38:01,170
Yeah.

5344
02:38:01,170 --> 02:38:02,170
This is our Hail Mary here.

5345
02:38:02,650 --> 02:38:02,850
Alright.

5346
02:38:02,890 --> 02:38:03,070
Ready?

5347
02:38:03,070 --> 02:38:03,230
Come here.

5348
02:38:03,310 --> 02:38:03,430
Come here.

5349
02:38:03,450 --> 02:38:03,550
Come here.

5350
02:38:03,570 --> 02:38:03,730
Ready?

5351
02:38:03,850 --> 02:38:04,390
We're gonna get on immediately.

5352
02:38:04,730 --> 02:38:04,930
Yeah.

5353
02:38:04,930 --> 02:38:04,990
Ready?

5354
02:38:05,130 --> 02:38:05,850
3, 2, 1, go.

5355
02:38:06,850 --> 02:38:07,730
We might die out of the air here.

5356
02:38:07,730 --> 02:38:07,970
Wait.

5357
02:38:08,290 --> 02:38:08,570
Toggy.

5358
02:38:08,830 --> 02:38:09,110
Toggy.

5359
02:38:09,490 --> 02:38:09,770
Toggy, please.

5360
02:38:10,850 --> 02:38:11,410
Toggy, please.

5361
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:13,310
I can't keep it in the air.

5362
02:38:13,850 --> 02:38:14,790
Let's see if Arby's free.

5363
02:38:14,890 --> 02:38:15,950
If Arby's free, we're playing there, okay?

5364
02:38:16,350 --> 02:38:16,630
Okay.

5365
02:38:19,590 --> 02:38:21,110
That was a scary shit-out.

5366
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:23,010
I would just land on top Mirage.

5367
02:38:23,770 --> 02:38:24,050
Wait.

5368
02:38:24,310 --> 02:38:24,390
Wait.

5369
02:38:24,390 --> 02:38:24,990
We're gonna get a better spot.

5370
02:38:25,170 --> 02:38:26,150
We're gonna play underneath here.

5371
02:38:26,230 --> 02:38:26,610
We're gonna play underneath here.

5372
02:38:27,030 --> 02:38:27,530
No, no, see.

5373
02:38:27,650 --> 02:38:28,130
No, see.

5374
02:38:28,150 --> 02:38:28,270
No, see.

5375
02:38:28,270 --> 02:38:28,390
No, see.

5376
02:38:28,390 --> 02:38:28,590
No, see.

5377
02:38:28,590 --> 02:38:29,630
No, Arby.

5378
02:38:29,650 --> 02:38:29,810
No, Arby.

5379
02:38:29,850 --> 02:38:31,470
No, see.

5380
02:38:31,470 --> 02:38:31,470
No, see.

5381
02:38:31,470 --> 02:38:31,470
No, see.

5382
02:38:31,470 --> 02:38:32,070
Oh, my god.

5383
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:34,430
You're so lucky.

5384
02:38:34,450 --> 02:38:35,170
You called that out.

5385
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:35,910
Nice.

5386
02:38:35,930 --> 02:38:36,170
Good job.

5387
02:38:36,410 --> 02:38:36,970
I'm fallen.

5388
02:38:37,130 --> 02:38:38,270
And I I cannot get out.

5389
02:38:38,330 --> 02:38:38,650
You're good.

5390
02:38:38,710 --> 02:38:38,930
You're good.

5391
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:39,490
I'm okay.

5392
02:38:39,770 --> 02:38:40,270
I'm okay.

5393
02:38:40,390 --> 02:38:40,610
I'm okay.

5394
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:40,830
I'm okay.

5395
02:38:41,310 --> 02:38:42,130
Open the door for you.

5396
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:42,650
You're good now.

5397
02:38:42,730 --> 02:38:43,430
Put the barrels down, Temba.

5398
02:38:43,430 --> 02:38:44,250
Put the barrels down this side.

5399
02:38:44,290 --> 02:38:44,970
This side when we're bored.

5400
02:38:45,350 --> 02:38:46,470
Yeah, we're gonna open this.

5401
02:38:47,250 --> 02:38:50,510
You're scared to pick it up, but I saw it with my eyes.

5402
02:38:50,970 --> 02:38:52,630
Why did my skin not pick it up?

5403
02:38:52,630 --> 02:38:55,470
I was like, there's people.

5404
02:38:56,530 --> 02:38:56,990
Oh, wait.

5405
02:38:57,050 --> 02:38:58,390
I can take this back.

5406
02:38:58,450 --> 02:38:59,550
I have a backpack now, guys.

5407
02:38:59,850 --> 02:39:00,170
Nice.

5408
02:39:00,170 --> 02:39:00,750
Great, Temba.

5409
02:39:00,770 --> 02:39:01,130
Good job.

5410
02:39:02,330 --> 02:39:03,390
Yo, I'm still broke.

5411
02:39:03,430 --> 02:39:04,070
I have one cell.

5412
02:39:04,330 --> 02:39:04,350
I'm happy.

5413
02:39:04,510 --> 02:39:05,650
I mean, I'm rested, bro.

5414
02:39:05,650 --> 02:39:07,470
You take some cells.

5415
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:10,510
I'm surprised that we're even alive right now.

5416
02:39:10,750 --> 02:39:11,190
Me too.

5417
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:11,750
Too bad.

5418
02:39:11,830 --> 02:39:12,390
Me too.

5419
02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:14,290
Okay, there's a problem, though.

5420
02:39:14,370 --> 02:39:16,910
We have a Kraber team here with a double red.

5421
02:39:17,110 --> 02:39:17,950
So like...

5422
02:39:18,490 --> 02:39:19,350
Bro, that is a problem.

5423
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:19,790
They can't push us.

5424
02:39:20,110 --> 02:39:21,810
Yeah, we just need to literally play small.

5425
02:39:21,870 --> 02:39:23,130
Temba, how long until your ulti gets back up?

5426
02:39:23,410 --> 02:39:23,870
It's up.

5427
02:39:23,950 --> 02:39:24,150
It's up.

5428
02:39:24,230 --> 02:39:24,790
Okay, cool.

5429
02:39:24,830 --> 02:39:25,530
So we're gonna play small.

5430
02:39:25,590 --> 02:39:26,350
Do not get Kraber.

5431
02:39:26,390 --> 02:39:27,350
Literally do not peek this window.

5432
02:39:27,510 --> 02:39:29,370
And they push us for the ulti outside, Temba.

5433
02:39:29,450 --> 02:39:29,630
Okay?

5434
02:39:29,770 --> 02:39:30,310
Like immediately.

5435
02:39:30,670 --> 02:39:31,330
I'll tell you what.

5436
02:39:31,350 --> 02:39:31,710
Wait.

5437
02:39:32,390 --> 02:39:32,950
Ulti outside?

5438
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:34,070
Yeah.

5439
02:39:34,430 --> 02:39:35,670
Ulti inside our RV if we need to.

5440
02:39:35,990 --> 02:39:36,390
Yeah, yeah.

5441
02:39:36,750 --> 02:39:39,210
But like, we want to make sure they can't just stand outside and just shoot us.

5442
02:39:39,350 --> 02:39:39,490
Yeah.

5443
02:39:40,190 --> 02:39:41,450
But we have next zone.

5444
02:39:41,570 --> 02:39:42,670
Just gonna keep looking out for these guys, okay?

5445
02:39:43,210 --> 02:39:43,570
All right.

5446
02:39:43,570 --> 02:39:44,210
I'm gonna stick...

5447
02:39:44,210 --> 02:39:44,570
Oh.

5448
02:39:45,550 --> 02:39:46,530
Oh my god.

5449
02:39:46,730 --> 02:39:47,210
You don't want purple.

5450
02:39:47,330 --> 02:39:47,510
It's okay.

5451
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:47,950
It's not a big deal.

5452
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:49,110
Okay, yeah, yeah.

5453
02:39:49,150 --> 02:39:49,890
We could all be purple.

5454
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:50,830
Yeah, but like...

5455
02:39:50,830 --> 02:39:51,150
Wait.

5456
02:39:51,210 --> 02:39:51,590
You have...

5457
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:52,770
I don't...

5458
02:39:52,770 --> 02:39:53,890
Okay, I can give you one more syringe.

5459
02:39:54,030 --> 02:39:54,670
I was gonna say...

5460
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:56,550
Yeah, I actually don't even know if I want to cross over to get that.

5461
02:39:57,890 --> 02:39:58,690
Is that a...

5462
02:39:58,690 --> 02:39:59,710
Well, here you go.

5463
02:40:00,970 --> 02:40:01,410
Thank you.

5464
02:40:01,510 --> 02:40:01,890
All right.

5465
02:40:01,890 --> 02:40:02,350
We're gonna play from here.

5466
02:40:02,570 --> 02:40:03,830
Tempo, keep putting these traps on the side.

5467
02:40:03,890 --> 02:40:04,790
Providence the side 100%.

5468
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:06,890
I think this is just because you need it.

5469
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:07,850
Thank you, ma'am.

5470
02:40:08,670 --> 02:40:09,130
All right.

5471
02:40:09,370 --> 02:40:10,270
You can never peek again.

5472
02:40:10,510 --> 02:40:11,490
I hear them moving.

5473
02:40:11,950 --> 02:40:14,190
Okay, when you ult, Tempo, you're gonna ult the outside.

5474
02:40:14,410 --> 02:40:15,330
Like, literally right here.

5475
02:40:15,490 --> 02:40:16,310
Yeah, right here.

5476
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:17,470
Yeah, if they push us.

5477
02:40:17,570 --> 02:40:19,630
I don't know if they're gonna be guaranteed, but they're thinking about it for sure.

5478
02:40:20,870 --> 02:40:21,530
You might think...

5479
02:40:21,530 --> 02:40:22,890
We have to be as small as possible.

5480
02:40:26,050 --> 02:40:26,690
Holy shit.

5481
02:40:26,750 --> 02:40:27,210
I'm not...

5482
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:28,370
Am I in zone?

5483
02:40:28,930 --> 02:40:29,470
I'm in...

5484
02:40:29,930 --> 02:40:30,690
No, we're in zone.

5485
02:40:30,710 --> 02:40:30,990
We're in zone.

5486
02:40:30,990 --> 02:40:31,550
Okay, we're in zone.

5487
02:40:31,570 --> 02:40:31,770
Okay.

5488
02:40:33,770 --> 02:40:34,830
I'm talking this wall.

5489
02:40:35,910 --> 02:40:39,110
Like, when I say ulti, bro, like, you can ulti whenever you think we're getting pushed.

5490
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:40,730
I can ulti right out this door, yeah.

5491
02:40:41,090 --> 02:40:42,910
Yeah, I wouldn't even do it yet, though, because they might try to wrap our other side.

5492
02:40:42,990 --> 02:40:43,470
Yeah, they're nading us now.

5493
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:43,730
They're nading us.

5494
02:40:44,330 --> 02:40:44,810
I'm safe.

5495
02:40:45,310 --> 02:40:45,790
I'm safe.

5496
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:47,310
Tempo, ult the outside now.

5497
02:40:47,390 --> 02:40:47,850
Ult the outside now.

5498
02:40:47,890 --> 02:40:48,270
Ult the outside now.

5499
02:40:48,490 --> 02:40:48,870
Right side.

5500
02:40:48,950 --> 02:40:49,110
Right side.

5501
02:40:49,250 --> 02:40:49,670
Ult the side.

5502
02:40:50,310 --> 02:40:50,790
I ulted.

5503
02:40:51,250 --> 02:40:51,490
Nice.

5504
02:40:51,490 --> 02:40:51,870
Good ulti.

5505
02:40:51,870 --> 02:40:52,090
Good ulti.

5506
02:40:52,130 --> 02:40:52,670
Focus this side now.

5507
02:40:52,670 --> 02:40:53,390
They can't peek out this side.

5508
02:40:53,430 --> 02:40:54,270
Only time they can peek is this.

5509
02:40:54,610 --> 02:40:55,170
Yeah, I'm looking.

5510
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:55,470
I'm looking.

5511
02:41:01,890 --> 02:41:03,090
Yeah, so we got n- Those are my thermites.

5512
02:41:03,150 --> 02:41:03,750
I can't go out.

5513
02:41:03,790 --> 02:41:04,290
I can't go out.

5514
02:41:04,390 --> 02:41:04,830
I can't either.

5515
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:05,150
I can't either.

5516
02:41:05,230 --> 02:41:05,650
Don't peek this yet.

5517
02:41:05,810 --> 02:41:06,490
Yeah, I don't know.

5518
02:41:06,570 --> 02:41:07,250
I don't feel safe.

5519
02:41:07,690 --> 02:41:07,990
They're still there.

5520
02:41:09,210 --> 02:41:09,770
They're still out there.

5521
02:41:09,790 --> 02:41:10,070
They're still out there.

5522
02:41:10,090 --> 02:41:10,270
We're good.

5523
02:41:10,290 --> 02:41:10,450
We're good.

5524
02:41:10,630 --> 02:41:11,690
Let's get barrels over here.

5525
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:12,050
Tempo, if we can.

5526
02:41:12,210 --> 02:41:12,690
I can't.

5527
02:41:12,690 --> 02:41:13,550
I have no barrels left.

5528
02:41:13,990 --> 02:41:14,190
Okay.

5529
02:41:14,270 --> 02:41:14,450
Okay.

5530
02:41:14,490 --> 02:41:14,690
It's fine.

5531
02:41:14,990 --> 02:41:15,450
Let them die.

5532
02:41:15,450 --> 02:41:16,090
They're going to die for it.

5533
02:41:16,850 --> 02:41:17,230
They're dying.

5534
02:41:17,270 --> 02:41:17,490
They're dying.

5535
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:17,750
We're good.

5536
02:41:17,790 --> 02:41:17,990
We're good.

5537
02:41:17,990 --> 02:41:18,170
We're good.

5538
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:18,390
We're good.

5539
02:41:18,390 --> 02:41:18,670
We are fine.

5540
02:41:18,790 --> 02:41:18,870
We are fine.

5541
02:41:18,930 --> 02:41:19,670
We are fucking...

5542
02:41:20,230 --> 02:41:21,090
Any grenades at all?

5543
02:41:21,130 --> 02:41:21,430
No, right?

5544
02:41:21,490 --> 02:41:21,990
No grenades at all?

5545
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:22,550
No more.

5546
02:41:22,850 --> 02:41:23,150
No more.

5547
02:41:23,290 --> 02:41:24,210
We are dying for it.

5548
02:41:24,330 --> 02:41:24,550
We are going...

5549
02:41:26,230 --> 02:41:27,350
Oh, you are dying for it!

5550
02:41:27,370 --> 02:41:28,170
You are dying for it!

5551
02:41:28,170 --> 02:41:28,770
We need to get across from this.

5552
02:41:28,770 --> 02:41:29,330
We need to get across from this.

5553
02:41:29,350 --> 02:41:29,610
You can't push.

5554
02:41:30,070 --> 02:41:30,310
Nice!

5555
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:33,710
Good job!

5556
02:41:33,790 --> 02:41:34,030
Good job!

5557
02:41:34,070 --> 02:41:34,290
Good job!

5558
02:41:34,990 --> 02:41:35,610
Oh my God.

5559
02:41:35,610 --> 02:41:37,810
Look at all these... Look at all these boxes they delivered to us!

5560
02:41:38,290 --> 02:41:39,790
We are getting pushed... Pushed up.

5561
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:40,010
We are getting pushed up.

5562
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:40,790
We are getting sent down.

5563
02:41:40,790 --> 02:41:41,270
We are getting sent down here.

5564
02:41:41,610 --> 02:41:42,490
These aren't my barrels.

5565
02:41:42,810 --> 02:41:43,210
It's fine.

5566
02:41:43,310 --> 02:41:43,730
We are getting sent down.

5567
02:41:43,730 --> 02:41:44,170
We are getting sent down.

5568
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:46,990
I have to go for this, bro.

5569
02:41:47,410 --> 02:41:47,730
I'm dead.

5570
02:41:47,730 --> 02:41:49,190
I don't know if the red box is...

5571
02:41:49,190 --> 02:41:51,650
I can't hold your barrel or not.

5572
02:41:51,830 --> 02:41:52,570
We're good, we're good, we're good.

5573
02:41:52,590 --> 02:41:52,870
Place low.

5574
02:41:52,970 --> 02:41:53,410
Just place low.

5575
02:41:53,770 --> 02:41:54,850
Here I go again.

5576
02:41:55,870 --> 02:41:56,310
Why not?

5577
02:41:56,510 --> 02:41:57,530
No reason not to.

5578
02:41:57,990 --> 02:41:58,910
Somehow we're still in zone.

5579
02:41:59,030 --> 02:42:00,590
Can't tell which barrel is modular or not.

5580
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:03,690
The only barrel that's in here is mine though.

5581
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:04,590
I got med kits and stuff.

5582
02:42:04,690 --> 02:42:05,030
We're good now.

5583
02:42:05,970 --> 02:42:07,070
They're gone, they're gone, they're gone.

5584
02:42:07,410 --> 02:42:08,310
We're still in zone!

5585
02:42:08,350 --> 02:42:09,170
They're gone, they're gone, they're gone.

5586
02:42:09,250 --> 02:42:09,950
Loot, loot, loot, loot.

5587
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:11,070
Eat some loot, eat some loot.

5588
02:42:11,210 --> 02:42:12,130
Eat, eat, eat, eat.

5589
02:42:12,130 --> 02:42:13,190
Eat, eat, eat, eat.

5590
02:42:13,690 --> 02:42:14,010
Eat.

5591
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:14,890
Okay,

5592
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:19,610
we're good, we're good.

5593
02:42:20,410 --> 02:42:22,110
Thank god they delivered their loot to us.

5594
02:42:22,430 --> 02:42:23,390
I got a Kraber, guys.

5595
02:42:23,790 --> 02:42:24,270
We won.

5596
02:42:24,310 --> 02:42:25,070
Wait, I have no loot.

5597
02:42:25,310 --> 02:42:26,570
Another Kraber, double Kraber.

5598
02:42:26,630 --> 02:42:27,030
Who wants to get it?

5599
02:42:27,130 --> 02:42:27,710
Okay, no, not me.

5600
02:42:27,730 --> 02:42:28,530
I'm horrible with that.

5601
02:42:29,030 --> 02:42:29,910
I'll take two Krabers.

5602
02:42:29,950 --> 02:42:30,790
I'll take two Krabers.

5603
02:42:31,010 --> 02:42:31,970
Nah, I'm not.

5604
02:42:32,470 --> 02:42:33,310
You're gonna run too...

5605
02:42:33,310 --> 02:42:34,510
Wake, are you throwing?

5606
02:42:35,170 --> 02:42:36,290
No, no, we're still healthy.

5607
02:42:37,390 --> 02:42:38,310
Wake, you're throwing.

5608
02:42:38,410 --> 02:42:39,030
Wake, you're throwing.

5609
02:42:39,090 --> 02:42:40,130
We're good, we're good, we're good.

5610
02:42:41,050 --> 02:42:41,970
Give me the Kraber.

5611
02:42:42,010 --> 02:42:42,790
Give me one of the Kraber.

5612
02:42:42,890 --> 02:42:43,190
You're throwing.

5613
02:42:45,650 --> 02:42:46,190
I'm definitely throwing.

5614
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:48,410
You're definitely throwing.

5615
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:50,190
But imagine the content.

5616
02:42:51,190 --> 02:42:52,410
Wait, I need that light ammo.

5617
02:42:52,610 --> 02:42:53,470
And the light mag.

5618
02:42:53,550 --> 02:42:54,150
And the light stuff.

5619
02:42:54,290 --> 02:42:54,770
Oh yeah.

5620
02:42:54,910 --> 02:42:55,630
I dropped you some.

5621
02:42:55,630 --> 02:42:56,430
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5622
02:42:56,630 --> 02:42:59,010
I cannot believe we're still in sound, guys.

5623
02:42:59,070 --> 02:42:59,930
Yo, how are we still alive?

5624
02:43:00,130 --> 02:43:00,390
I don't know.

5625
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:02,270
I mean, you guys made that so good.

5626
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:03,970
Just live here.

5627
02:43:04,010 --> 02:43:04,430
We live here.

5628
02:43:04,490 --> 02:43:05,190
Let them kill each other.

5629
02:43:05,290 --> 02:43:06,730
I don't think we can... we don't need a...

5630
02:43:06,730 --> 02:43:07,990
Does anyone have any nades?

5631
02:43:08,470 --> 02:43:09,050
In game.

5632
02:43:10,130 --> 02:43:10,610
Does anyone have...

5633
02:43:10,930 --> 02:43:11,210
No.

5634
02:43:14,010 --> 02:43:15,350
Come on, zone pull to us.

5635
02:43:16,050 --> 02:43:16,550
No, it's fine.

5636
02:43:16,690 --> 02:43:16,830
It's fine.

5637
02:43:16,990 --> 02:43:17,510
We're gonna play underneath.

5638
02:43:17,690 --> 02:43:17,890
We're good.

5639
02:43:17,930 --> 02:43:18,090
We're good.

5640
02:43:18,270 --> 02:43:18,730
We're gonna play underneath.

5641
02:43:19,730 --> 02:43:20,010
That's it.

5642
02:43:20,130 --> 02:43:20,670
Yeah, we just play underneath.

5643
02:43:20,910 --> 02:43:21,150
We're good.

5644
02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:22,650
Oh, here's more light.

5645
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:24,270
How the fuck are we gonna kill them?

5646
02:43:25,450 --> 02:43:25,950
Thank God.

5647
02:43:28,190 --> 02:43:29,010
Yo, we're top three.

5648
02:43:29,610 --> 02:43:31,010
Wait, wait, wait.

5649
02:43:31,130 --> 02:43:32,430
We gotta wait for them to kill each other.

5650
02:43:32,650 --> 02:43:33,050
I know.

5651
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:33,810
I'm gonna try to pressure them.

5652
02:43:34,170 --> 02:43:34,830
They're gonna force it.

5653
02:43:34,830 --> 02:43:35,590
They're shooting each other.

5654
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:37,050
We're gonna evac up if they fight this.

5655
02:43:37,070 --> 02:43:38,010
If they fight, we evac up, okay?

5656
02:43:38,010 --> 02:43:39,130
I don't have an evac.

5657
02:43:39,350 --> 02:43:41,390
We're gonna play late though.

5658
02:43:41,430 --> 02:43:41,910
Just play here late.

5659
02:43:42,290 --> 02:43:42,530
Yeah.

5660
02:43:44,210 --> 02:43:44,530
We're good.

5661
02:43:44,590 --> 02:43:44,870
I'm ready.

5662
02:43:44,970 --> 02:43:46,010
I'm actually hitting these kids too.

5663
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:47,130
I'm ready for them to A-plus.

5664
02:43:47,150 --> 02:43:47,870
They knocked one.

5665
02:43:47,930 --> 02:43:48,270
They knocked one.

5666
02:43:48,970 --> 02:43:49,430
Okay, it's fine.

5667
02:43:49,510 --> 02:43:49,630
It's fine.

5668
02:43:49,650 --> 02:43:50,010
We're gonna push slow.

5669
02:43:50,070 --> 02:43:50,670
Wait till they trade more.

5670
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:52,270
I didn't see a kill feed.

5671
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:54,230
The nade.

5672
02:43:54,230 --> 02:43:54,630
They need it.

5673
02:43:54,690 --> 02:43:54,890
They need it.

5674
02:43:55,130 --> 02:43:55,610
They full kill.

5675
02:43:55,670 --> 02:43:56,050
They full kill.

5676
02:43:56,070 --> 02:43:56,170
Nice.

5677
02:43:56,270 --> 02:43:56,730
They full kill one.

5678
02:43:56,750 --> 02:43:56,950
That's good.

5679
02:43:57,410 --> 02:43:57,750
We're good.

5680
02:43:57,790 --> 02:43:57,950
We're good.

5681
02:43:57,970 --> 02:43:58,510
We're gonna play this late.

5682
02:43:58,570 --> 02:43:58,990
We're just gonna play late.

5683
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:00,850
We can't really go up here yet because we're gonna die.

5684
02:44:01,530 --> 02:44:01,990
I mean...

5685
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:05,470
I mean, we're gonna have to evac up for sure.

5686
02:44:06,750 --> 02:44:07,490
Oh, I can climb.

5687
02:44:07,530 --> 02:44:08,210
I'm a mountain goat.

5688
02:44:08,670 --> 02:44:10,850
Oh, I'm a mountain goat.

5689
02:44:11,150 --> 02:44:12,690
How did you climb this?

5690
02:44:13,350 --> 02:44:14,470
Oh shit, they know I'm here.

5691
02:44:14,530 --> 02:44:15,070
Oh shit.

5692
02:44:15,190 --> 02:44:15,570
Abort mission.

5693
02:44:15,690 --> 02:44:16,150
Abort mission.

5694
02:44:16,570 --> 02:44:17,470
I'm trying to get second.

5695
02:44:17,830 --> 02:44:18,490
I move up.

5696
02:44:18,590 --> 02:44:19,130
I'm gonna go.

5697
02:44:19,950 --> 02:44:21,350
We're so dead.

5698
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:21,830
We're so dead.

5699
02:44:21,930 --> 02:44:22,110
It's fine.

5700
02:44:22,130 --> 02:44:22,730
Let's go mountain goat.

5701
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:23,670
Alright, ready?

5702
02:44:23,750 --> 02:44:24,450
I have my crossbow.

5703
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:27,230
I'm evac towering.

5704
02:44:27,290 --> 02:44:28,190
And you guys take this.

5705
02:44:28,230 --> 02:44:28,830
You guys take this.

5706
02:44:28,850 --> 02:44:29,510
Okay, okay, okay.

5707
02:44:30,330 --> 02:44:30,690
Ready?

5708
02:44:30,890 --> 02:44:31,570
We're gonna do this together.

5709
02:44:31,690 --> 02:44:32,450
Go, go, go.

5710
02:44:33,150 --> 02:44:34,050
Oh, they've grenade.

5711
02:44:35,470 --> 02:44:35,850
We win this, guys.

5712
02:44:35,970 --> 02:44:36,590
We win this shit.

5713
02:44:36,810 --> 02:44:38,390
I cost the cast to someone.

5714
02:44:40,610 --> 02:44:42,070
Alright, I died right out of the air.

5715
02:44:42,190 --> 02:44:44,030
I'm okay with second.

5716
02:44:44,250 --> 02:44:44,550
I'm okay with second.

5717
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:44,810
Kill one.

5718
02:44:44,870 --> 02:44:45,710
Kill one at least.

5719
02:44:46,090 --> 02:44:47,210
We got the win.

5720
02:44:51,410 --> 02:44:53,170
How did we get top two?

5721
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:55,170
We got second.

5722
02:44:57,030 --> 02:44:58,090
Oh my god.

5723
02:44:59,030 --> 02:45:01,350
How did we get second?

5724
02:45:05,070 --> 02:45:07,190
We were so broke.

5725
02:45:07,250 --> 02:45:07,570
We were so broke.

5726
02:45:07,570 --> 02:45:08,510
I don't know how that works.

5727
02:45:08,890 --> 02:45:11,190
They didn't finish the job.

5728
02:45:11,910 --> 02:45:14,990
I've never seen that house with that RV in for that long.

5729
02:45:15,030 --> 02:45:16,150
I've never seen that house with that RV in for that long.

5730
02:45:16,150 --> 02:45:16,670
I've never seen that house with that RV in for that long.

5731
02:45:16,730 --> 02:45:18,530
I can't believe they were dating.

5732
02:45:18,870 --> 02:45:20,910
We had zone knowledge.

5733
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:22,770
Oh my god.

5734
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:23,710
Good shit, dude.

5735
02:45:24,510 --> 02:45:25,630
Oh my god.

5736
02:45:25,650 --> 02:45:25,970
Good shit.

5737
02:45:27,090 --> 02:45:28,470
They should have finished the job.

5738
02:45:28,470 --> 02:45:30,090
We had one kill.

5739
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:32,530
It was Davis' team, by the way.

5740
02:45:33,710 --> 02:45:35,170
Yo, we're in fourth place.

5741
02:45:35,970 --> 02:45:36,510
Let's go.

5742
02:45:37,430 --> 02:45:38,190
Oh, fuck.

5743
02:45:38,570 --> 02:45:39,070
Good shit.

5744
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:42,410
Chat, I don't know how y'all wanted us to fight that, bro.

5745
02:45:42,530 --> 02:45:44,810
When they land top rock and we have no horizon.

5746
02:45:45,290 --> 02:45:46,150
Bro, one...

5747
02:45:47,070 --> 02:45:52,150
Team one, team three, and team two are cleaning everybody out.

5748
02:45:52,610 --> 02:45:56,910
Those are all three teams that we knew about.

5749
02:45:57,250 --> 02:45:57,550
Yeah.

5750
02:45:57,570 --> 02:45:58,450
One, two, and three.

5751
02:45:58,930 --> 02:46:00,070
And even five.

5752
02:46:01,390 --> 02:46:02,430
To some extent.

5753
02:46:03,670 --> 02:46:06,210
They literally cleaned more than half the lobby themselves.

5754
02:46:06,930 --> 02:46:08,450
Good fucking shit, dude.

5755
02:46:09,430 --> 02:46:10,090
Alright, guys.

5756
02:46:10,170 --> 02:46:10,750
We're halfway there.

5757
02:46:11,350 --> 02:46:12,550
No, that's a great play from us.

5758
02:46:12,690 --> 02:46:14,010
I cannot believe that just happened, bro.

5759
02:46:14,570 --> 02:46:16,590
I can't believe we held that off.

5760
02:46:16,670 --> 02:46:17,030
I know.

5761
02:46:17,130 --> 02:46:18,110
We were so lucky.

5762
02:46:18,370 --> 02:46:21,730
We had zero meds and then the team just gave us loot.

5763
02:46:21,830 --> 02:46:22,830
And then they delivered their meds to us.

5764
02:46:23,150 --> 02:46:24,490
They Amazon primed us.

5765
02:46:27,430 --> 02:46:28,330
Let's fucking go.

5766
02:46:28,470 --> 02:46:28,810
Let's fucking go, guys.

5767
02:46:28,950 --> 02:46:29,730
Oh, wait.

5768
02:46:30,470 --> 02:46:32,110
Is this code for lobby two?

5769
02:46:32,190 --> 02:46:32,650
Is that our code?

5770
02:46:34,190 --> 02:46:35,610
I think this is lobby two.

5771
02:46:35,810 --> 02:46:36,510
There it is.

5772
02:46:36,730 --> 02:46:38,250
Let me post it in the thing.

5773
02:46:40,590 --> 02:46:41,190
Alright, guys.

5774
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:41,610
Let's do it.

5775
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:43,870
I have to pee again.

5776
02:46:44,710 --> 02:46:45,110
Wow.

5777
02:46:45,110 --> 02:46:47,130
I can't believe how many people just landed on me like that.

5778
02:46:47,170 --> 02:46:47,490
That's nuts.

5779
02:46:47,870 --> 02:46:48,690
That's actually crazy.

5780
02:46:48,690 --> 02:46:50,670
Good job to get away.

5781
02:46:50,810 --> 02:46:51,210
Seriously.

5782
02:46:51,550 --> 02:46:52,490
You fucking saved that game.

5783
02:46:52,590 --> 02:46:52,850
Good shit.

5784
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:53,630
Thank god.

5785
02:46:54,270 --> 02:46:55,750
That dead side clutched it.

5786
02:46:56,290 --> 02:46:59,450
That's ten points that literally is gonna probably get us through if we make it.

5787
02:47:00,230 --> 02:47:02,630
I don't feel safe, man.

5788
02:47:02,910 --> 02:47:03,670
I don't know.

5789
02:47:03,990 --> 02:47:05,870
That's the most safe we've ever been.

5790
02:47:05,990 --> 02:47:06,570
That was unreal.

5791
02:47:06,890 --> 02:47:08,030
You fucking shit.

5792
02:47:09,870 --> 02:47:10,790
Oh my god.

5793
02:47:10,850 --> 02:47:11,370
That's unreal.

5794
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:13,150
I can't believe that just happened.

5795
02:47:14,290 --> 02:47:16,010
Can't believe we actually...

5796
02:47:16,690 --> 02:47:19,430
I mean, have you guys seen when they went in the RV?

5797
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:21,170
Like, you're fucking goaded for that, bro.

5798
02:47:22,250 --> 02:47:23,550
You're actually so good.

5799
02:47:23,790 --> 02:47:23,810
Oh my god.

5800
02:47:24,190 --> 02:47:24,950
Yeah, yeah.

5801
02:47:24,990 --> 02:47:25,410
Thank god.

5802
02:47:25,470 --> 02:47:25,690
I...

5803
02:47:25,750 --> 02:47:26,470
used my eyes.

5804
02:47:27,210 --> 02:47:29,310
I used my eyes there.

5805
02:47:30,110 --> 02:47:31,810
How did we not...

5806
02:47:31,810 --> 02:47:32,850
How did I not scan them?

5807
02:47:33,170 --> 02:47:36,270
I think it's cause they came out at the last second.

5808
02:47:36,590 --> 02:47:37,490
I think so too.

5809
02:47:37,630 --> 02:47:37,830
Yeah.

5810
02:47:39,850 --> 02:47:41,190
Can you guys let me know when the game starts up?

5811
02:47:41,290 --> 02:47:41,910
I'm watching our VOD back.

5812
02:47:41,930 --> 02:47:44,730
Someone was like, respect to the Bloodhound for going for that Krayber shot.

5813
02:47:45,390 --> 02:47:46,230
At the end.

5814
02:47:46,490 --> 02:47:47,110
That's me!

5815
02:47:48,290 --> 02:47:48,990
You're such a beast.

5816
02:47:51,490 --> 02:47:52,150
That's me!

5817
02:47:52,470 --> 02:47:53,450
I was like, wait.

5818
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:54,490
I'm the Bloodhound!

5819
02:47:55,750 --> 02:47:57,150
I thought my chat was telling me to play edge.

5820
02:47:57,210 --> 02:47:58,070
It's like, bro, play edge?

5821
02:47:59,010 --> 02:47:59,330
Guys.

5822
02:48:00,450 --> 02:48:02,190
I'm pretty sure all these teams are playing edge.

5823
02:48:02,630 --> 02:48:03,810
We should get one kill.

5824
02:48:03,950 --> 02:48:04,810
What do we mean play edge?

5825
02:48:04,970 --> 02:48:06,610
Yeah, we don't need a kill.

5826
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:07,950
We just need to be in zone.

5827
02:48:12,290 --> 02:48:12,610
Unreal.

5828
02:48:13,690 --> 02:48:16,030
Good fucking call, Temba, by the way, that we can ulti out of that angle.

5829
02:48:18,050 --> 02:48:18,370
Yep.

5830
02:48:18,990 --> 02:48:21,630
Weren't you the one that told me to ulti out of there?

5831
02:48:22,910 --> 02:48:23,610
Really good call.

5832
02:48:24,350 --> 02:48:26,770
And also, great call by Doki to swerve back to our VOD.

5833
02:48:27,010 --> 02:48:27,410
Yeah!

5834
02:48:27,670 --> 02:48:29,130
That would have been so good.

5835
02:48:29,570 --> 02:48:31,330
We have such good chemistry!

5836
02:48:31,690 --> 02:48:33,730
I think this is like ALGS material.

5837
02:48:34,510 --> 02:48:36,030
We got ALGS, bro.

5838
02:48:36,210 --> 02:48:39,430
If we keep on going, we'll make it to the pro league.

5839
02:48:39,830 --> 02:48:40,570
That's what I'm saying.

5840
02:48:46,180 --> 02:48:46,980
Oh my god.

5841
02:48:47,040 --> 02:48:47,740
Let's fucking go.

5842
02:48:47,980 --> 02:48:48,720
That was a hell of a rotate.

5843
02:48:48,980 --> 02:48:49,660
Oh my god.

5844
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:51,340
I'm so surprised we made it this far.

5845
02:48:51,420 --> 02:48:53,880
I'm so surprised all the teams behind us died.

5846
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:54,840
I'm so surprised all the teams behind us died.

5847
02:48:59,740 --> 02:49:00,360
I'm so surprised all the teams behind us died.

5848
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:01,540
It sounds like, do it for the content creators.

5849
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,540
Let's pass the other round so we can make more content.

5850
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:05,980
Let's pass the other round so we can make more content.

5851
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:08,980
ALGS needs more publicity.

5852
02:49:09,240 --> 02:49:10,020
We're here for it.

5853
02:49:10,300 --> 02:49:10,740
Yep.

5854
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:12,620
We're providing it right now.

5855
02:49:13,060 --> 02:49:14,480
Slowly but surely getting to pro league.

5856
02:49:14,480 --> 02:49:15,440
We're giving you publicity!

5857
02:49:16,060 --> 02:49:18,040
Let us through to the final round!

5858
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:19,940
Give us the content creator pass.

5859
02:49:20,420 --> 02:49:24,300
I think my favorite part of this though is that I always tell chat how bad RVs are.

5860
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:27,620
I think my favorite part of this though is that I always tell chat how bad RVs are.

5861
02:49:27,620 --> 02:49:31,640
Yeah, our highest placements were RVed by the way.

5862
02:49:32,700 --> 02:49:35,180
Yo, RV is okay when you have a caustic.

5863
02:49:36,740 --> 02:49:37,420
I mean, true.

5864
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:37,660
Yeah.

5865
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:39,680
Definitely true.

5866
02:49:41,460 --> 02:49:44,980
Alright, so someone did land here and here.

5867
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:46,220
Okay, yeah.

5868
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:47,420
Here and here.

5869
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:48,300
So we... okay.

5870
02:49:48,940 --> 02:49:50,260
How many X's is that?

5871
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:51,520
5, 6, 7, 8?

5872
02:49:54,860 --> 02:49:58,360
I mean, thank god also that Rampart team did not try to fight us too much.

5873
02:49:58,440 --> 02:49:59,360
And they went on the outside of our team.

5874
02:49:59,380 --> 02:50:02,140
Yeah, and then they got shit on by the people on top.

5875
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:08,460
I mean, they wanted to, but we got so many like fucking barrels and stuff they couldn't get in.

5876
02:50:09,580 --> 02:50:12,740
Yeah, if you didn't tell me to line up the barrels, I would have split like 3 and 3.

5877
02:50:12,860 --> 02:50:15,180
But we had 5 barrels on that side, so...

5878
02:50:15,180 --> 02:50:15,480
Yeah.

5879
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:18,140
I mean, that's the only stop they can peek because the other team is going to shoot them the whole time.

5880
02:50:18,480 --> 02:50:18,560
Yeah.

5881
02:50:22,440 --> 02:50:23,360
What the hell is the game?

5882
02:50:23,460 --> 02:50:23,880
Where is...

5883
02:50:24,860 --> 02:50:26,540
They're waiting for someone.

5884
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:27,260
Davis.

5885
02:50:28,060 --> 02:50:28,420
Okay.

5886
02:50:28,460 --> 02:50:29,360
Let me open up the chat.

5887
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:29,960
Let me know when we start up.

5888
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:31,560
Someone fucking move this guy.

5889
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:34,200
Yeah, someone move him so we can start.

5890
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:36,080
Yeah, Tempo get in there bro.

5891
02:50:36,580 --> 02:50:37,800
Someone fucking move him.

5892
02:50:39,360 --> 02:50:43,080
Apparently his team was like, can we have Wig over Davis?

5893
02:50:43,380 --> 02:50:44,340
Bro, I take Wig.

5894
02:50:45,740 --> 02:50:46,140
Woah!

5895
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:49,200
We just got 10 points there.

5896
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:49,940
I'm not trying to brag.

5897
02:50:50,080 --> 02:50:51,000
What are we doing?

5898
02:50:53,800 --> 02:50:58,240
God bro, if I had any of my loot, I would have fucking got 3 kills in this Rampart team so hard.

5899
02:50:58,240 --> 02:51:00,200
I was just shooting a Nomag Brower.

5900
02:51:00,340 --> 02:51:01,000
I was so ass.

5901
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:07,380
We're now at the part where they're trying to raid us in the RV.

5902
02:51:07,640 --> 02:51:08,440
Yeah, I'm watching right now.

5903
02:51:09,880 --> 02:51:11,320
It's so fun to watch the VOD back.

5904
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:14,020
Yeah, the 10 minute delay is...

5905
02:51:14,620 --> 02:51:16,500
Everyone was like, SCANDOKI!

5906
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:18,120
I was like, I'm scared.

5907
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:18,700
I don't want to move.

5908
02:51:20,580 --> 02:51:22,880
I didn't want to make any noise or move.

5909
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:23,840
I was so scared.

5910
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:26,520
We got this bro.

5911
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:27,020
Let's go.

5912
02:51:27,080 --> 02:51:28,100
We're so fucking valid.

5913
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:28,580
Let's start the game.

5914
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:29,180
I'll be like, what the fuck?

5915
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:29,720
Nice.

5916
02:51:33,320 --> 02:51:35,900
Oh my god, you guys murdered that Bloodhound that ran in.

5917
02:51:35,980 --> 02:51:37,680
I almost died if you didn't kill him.

5918
02:51:37,880 --> 02:51:40,500
I mean, I had to peek that bro because I just can't let them get the fuck inside.

5919
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:43,520
Even though I died there, it was still worth it to be honest.

5920
02:51:45,460 --> 02:51:50,320
Hold on, I'm saying like, if you guys didn't kill the Blood that ran in, I would have died and you would have died.

5921
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:51,620
Yeah, no, you guys are great.

5922
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:54,300
And I'm dying to a Caustic Barrel because I have no idea which one is yours.

5923
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:58,020
You're still living in the fucking Rampart team.

5924
02:51:58,020 --> 02:51:58,220
You're still living in the fucking Rampart team.

5925
02:51:58,240 --> 02:51:59,760
I was like so chaotic.

5926
02:51:59,900 --> 02:52:03,680
It was so chaotic and I was like trying to loot some syringes and shit.

5927
02:52:03,820 --> 02:52:07,220
And then two barrels showed up and I was like, oh, I don't remember throwing those barrels there.

5928
02:52:07,420 --> 02:52:08,480
And then they just popped.

5929
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:10,760
And then I forgot to mention that they weren't mine.

5930
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:13,140
I mean, I had to go for that though because I had no heals.

5931
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:14,920
I would have been a useless fucking flesh bag.

5932
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:16,540
You'd just be her meat shield.

5933
02:52:17,100 --> 02:52:18,980
I gotta get something right now.

5934
02:52:18,980 --> 02:52:19,560
Like, fuck me.

5935
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:20,800
Alright, Wig.

5936
02:52:21,220 --> 02:52:22,680
Jump us to the promised land.

5937
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:23,740
I got you, baby.

5938
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:25,020
Yo, did you realize?

5939
02:52:25,740 --> 02:52:26,440
We've had...

5940
02:52:26,840 --> 02:52:28,840
Have we had beacon every single game?

5941
02:52:29,020 --> 02:52:30,320
Bro, where was this in Twitch Rivals?

5942
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:31,520
Yeah, what the fuck?

5943
02:52:32,340 --> 02:52:33,900
We're kind of getting bitter POIs here.

5944
02:52:38,060 --> 02:52:40,200
Even Geyser has had beacon two games in a row.

5945
02:52:40,660 --> 02:52:40,900
Even Geyser has had beacon two games in a row.

5946
02:52:41,880 --> 02:52:42,600
Yeah, what the fuck?

5947
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:44,060
Which is where we landed in Twitch Rivals.

5948
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:45,580
We had zero beacon.

5949
02:52:47,140 --> 02:52:48,080
That was my own problem.

5950
02:52:48,140 --> 02:52:48,680
They couldn't let us win.

5951
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:49,120
That's how it goes.

5952
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:52,400
Yeah, cause then they'll be like, hmmm...

5953
02:52:52,400 --> 02:52:55,000
The organizer gets the fucking beacon.

5954
02:52:55,020 --> 02:52:55,700
Beacons...

5955
02:52:56,660 --> 02:52:57,400
Geyser is there.

5956
02:52:57,520 --> 02:52:58,400
Mod is there.

5957
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:01,440
I'm gonna split off now and head to beacon.

5958
02:53:02,060 --> 02:53:03,840
I go loot these.

5959
02:53:04,380 --> 02:53:05,620
This is so much fun, guys.

5960
02:53:05,660 --> 02:53:06,240
They should play it.

5961
02:53:07,580 --> 02:53:08,560
I'm having a great time.

5962
02:53:08,920 --> 02:53:11,140
I had zero expectations going into this.

5963
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:13,500
Yeah, I thought we were out after the first round.

5964
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:14,020
I'm not gonna lie.

5965
02:53:15,620 --> 02:53:16,480
That's the new Lulu.

5966
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:17,580
I love that about you, though, Tempo.

5967
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:18,660
You're giving me hype a little bit.

5968
02:53:18,820 --> 02:53:19,820
Prime expectations.

5969
02:53:20,020 --> 02:53:21,760
I was like, I don't know, guys.

5970
02:53:22,040 --> 02:53:23,640
I don't know if we're gonna make it to the first round.

5971
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:25,420
We had zero practice as a team.

5972
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:27,120
Other than the Twitch Rivals.

5973
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:28,440
And that didn't go so well.

5974
02:53:29,800 --> 02:53:30,920
Please don't shoot me, guys.

5975
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:31,920
Here's the charge rifle.

5976
02:53:32,080 --> 02:53:32,540
I pinged it.

5977
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:34,300
I can't ping it.

5978
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:35,700
I'm beacon-ing.

5979
02:53:37,060 --> 02:53:37,620
I'm right-row.

5980
02:53:37,700 --> 02:53:38,640
I had another evac, too.

5981
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:39,560
You can ping an L.

5982
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:40,900
You did it.

5983
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:42,780
There's some sniper ammo, too, here.

5984
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:44,940
Wait, where's...

5985
02:53:45,860 --> 02:53:46,740
It's on the second floor.

5986
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:47,360
Is it with the sniper ammo?

5987
02:53:47,700 --> 02:53:48,860
No, it's on the second floor.

5988
02:53:55,960 --> 02:53:58,020
I mean, we had no chance to win that game.

5989
02:53:58,560 --> 02:53:59,500
We did a good job getting into second place there.

5990
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:02,700
Yeah, we're so lucky that they decided to push each other.

5991
02:54:02,780 --> 02:54:03,900
There's a lot more sniper ammo here.

5992
02:54:04,500 --> 02:54:05,000
Okay, nice.

5993
02:54:05,620 --> 02:54:06,640
I'm vault hemlock right now.

5994
02:54:06,640 --> 02:54:06,960
Not too bad.

5995
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:08,780
I have a 6x here, too, for you.

5996
02:54:13,930 --> 02:54:14,950
I'm so confused.

5997
02:54:15,070 --> 02:54:16,070
I don't know what's going on anymore.

5998
02:54:16,410 --> 02:54:16,910
What happened?

5999
02:54:17,010 --> 02:54:17,190
What do you mean?

6000
02:54:17,270 --> 02:54:17,770
Why are you confused?

6001
02:54:19,430 --> 02:54:22,110
I'm just running in circles.

6002
02:54:22,510 --> 02:54:23,210
You're good, buddy.

6003
02:54:26,950 --> 02:54:28,170
I don't think he's okay.

6004
02:54:28,710 --> 02:54:31,830
I hear he just got stressed out whenever Tempo says, like, what do you mean?

6005
02:54:31,950 --> 02:54:32,310
What do you mean?

6006
02:54:32,370 --> 02:54:33,750
Yeah, it's like, what do you mean?

6007
02:54:33,830 --> 02:54:34,490
What do you mean you're okay?

6008
02:54:36,950 --> 02:54:38,390
Wait, I don't need that anymore.

6009
02:54:38,530 --> 02:54:39,410
I just picked one up.

6010
02:54:44,890 --> 02:54:46,110
You did the charge rifle?

6011
02:54:47,630 --> 02:54:49,510
Alright, well, I mean, I'll do this whole shot and we're good to go.

6012
02:54:51,170 --> 02:54:52,270
There's a 6x here, too.

6013
02:54:58,550 --> 02:54:59,710
I got a...

6014
02:55:00,910 --> 02:55:02,050
I got a...

6015
02:55:02,570 --> 02:55:03,130
read-a-play.

6016
02:55:03,830 --> 02:55:04,550
I love you, bro.

6017
02:55:04,710 --> 02:55:08,590
At least kill one as I'm just flying into a whole three-man with Cosmic Gaps all over.

6018
02:55:09,190 --> 02:55:09,850
Can I kill one?

6019
02:55:09,990 --> 02:55:10,470
Can I kill one?

6020
02:55:10,610 --> 02:55:11,390
I'm just fucking dead.

6021
02:55:13,090 --> 02:55:14,770
I like how we all each individually...

6022
02:55:14,770 --> 02:55:16,450
Now me just floating around in the air.

6023
02:55:16,530 --> 02:55:18,470
Yeah, now me just floating around in the air not knowing what to do.

6024
02:55:18,530 --> 02:55:19,010
He's like, get one!

6025
02:55:19,430 --> 02:55:20,010
I'm like, yeah, dude.

6026
02:55:20,710 --> 02:55:23,070
I'm gonna find a fucking spot to land first, big dog.

6027
02:55:23,090 --> 02:55:23,490
Get one.

6028
02:55:24,450 --> 02:55:24,710
Yeah.

6029
02:55:24,830 --> 02:55:25,490
I love it, dude.

6030
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:26,450
I love it so much.

6031
02:55:26,490 --> 02:55:30,370
I think my favorite part was that we each individually fought different brits.

6032
02:55:30,790 --> 02:55:32,390
Yes, that was fucking awesome.

6033
02:55:33,110 --> 02:55:34,370
Do we have a thingy?

6034
02:55:34,370 --> 02:55:38,430
By the way, this is a horrible zone for us and we have no EvoCache until Geyser, so...

6035
02:55:38,430 --> 02:55:39,050
Oh, yeah.

6036
02:55:39,090 --> 02:55:40,190
That's what I was about to ask about.

6037
02:55:40,270 --> 02:55:41,110
The EvoCache thing.

6038
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:42,030
Can we people...

6039
02:55:42,030 --> 02:55:43,450
Do we have a people thingy?

6040
02:55:43,550 --> 02:55:44,330
No, we have nothing.

6041
02:55:44,830 --> 02:55:46,330
We got a big mod, though.

6042
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:47,070
We got a big mod to do that.

6043
02:55:48,590 --> 02:55:48,930
We're good.

6044
02:55:49,230 --> 02:55:50,330
There's a heavy mag on that.

6045
02:55:50,390 --> 02:55:51,630
Someone grab it if you need it.

6046
02:55:52,030 --> 02:55:52,970
I need it, yeah.

6047
02:55:54,470 --> 02:55:55,590
I got the blue one.

6048
02:55:55,910 --> 02:55:56,770
Yeah, I'll take the blue.

6049
02:55:57,430 --> 02:56:01,150
Alright, let's go scan people and then also the zone over at Mog.

6050
02:56:02,130 --> 02:56:03,590
Are they still there or did he left?

6051
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:05,230
No, they definitely left for sure.

6052
02:56:05,350 --> 02:56:08,770
Unless they're routing it, but the whole paintball side is looted, so I would assume they left.

6053
02:56:10,930 --> 02:56:12,750
I can show presence first and see what's good.

6054
02:56:14,410 --> 02:56:15,870
I'll fly up and if I die, just run.

6055
02:56:17,410 --> 02:56:18,010
That's the chat.

6056
02:56:18,590 --> 02:56:20,590
I can't lie, they looted this like fucking horribly.

6057
02:56:20,730 --> 02:56:21,490
There's so much shit left.

6058
02:56:21,650 --> 02:56:22,190
Do you guys need anything?

6059
02:56:22,650 --> 02:56:24,050
They like fast looted, I guess.

6060
02:56:24,510 --> 02:56:26,690
Yeah, this team wants to just get the hell out of here immediately.

6061
02:56:26,910 --> 02:56:27,930
Which I kind of respect.

6062
02:56:28,150 --> 02:56:28,910
It's like the right play to play.

6063
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:32,630
Oh, there's Bats here.

6064
02:56:32,850 --> 02:56:33,690
Oh, yes.

6065
02:56:34,970 --> 02:56:36,090
I need a sniper scope.

6066
02:56:36,090 --> 02:56:37,110
I'll people scan it.

6067
02:56:37,770 --> 02:56:38,370
Yeah, you're good.

6068
02:56:38,410 --> 02:56:40,190
Hit the people scan and then we'll hit the console beacon again.

6069
02:56:40,430 --> 02:56:41,990
I think we just wait until the zone closes, to be honest.

6070
02:56:42,670 --> 02:56:44,150
Okay, you want me to scan now or wait?

6071
02:56:45,110 --> 02:56:45,830
I would wait.

6072
02:56:45,930 --> 02:56:48,310
I think we just play the top Mog and then scan both and then we just rotate in.

6073
02:56:48,370 --> 02:56:49,530
Because we're going to be late to this no matter what.

6074
02:56:50,390 --> 02:56:52,930
I'd rather know the next circle and see if this is a crazy pull or not.

6075
02:56:53,050 --> 02:56:53,590
I don't think it should...

6076
02:56:53,590 --> 02:56:54,630
Oh my god.

6077
02:56:54,770 --> 02:56:54,950
Okay.

6078
02:56:55,250 --> 02:56:57,710
Team over at the drop the fucking evac tower.

6079
02:56:57,850 --> 02:56:58,270
I see them.

6080
02:56:58,750 --> 02:56:59,530
They're taking the evac.

6081
02:57:00,330 --> 02:57:01,390
Yeah, I just want to land on us.

6082
02:57:01,390 --> 02:57:02,130
Play together up here.

6083
02:57:02,130 --> 02:57:02,710
What the fuck?

6084
02:57:03,490 --> 02:57:03,990
They're good.

6085
02:57:04,030 --> 02:57:04,270
They're good.

6086
02:57:04,910 --> 02:57:07,190
They almost stuck me with an arc.

6087
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:08,110
Are they pushing us?

6088
02:57:08,910 --> 02:57:09,350
They are.

6089
02:57:09,450 --> 02:57:09,690
They are.

6090
02:57:09,690 --> 02:57:09,850
They are.

6091
02:57:10,730 --> 02:57:11,830
They know we have white.

6092
02:57:12,790 --> 02:57:14,310
Oh, we're fucked.

6093
02:57:14,370 --> 02:57:14,670
We're fucked.

6094
02:57:14,710 --> 02:57:15,150
We're so fucked.

6095
02:57:16,850 --> 02:57:17,710
Run if you can.

6096
02:57:17,750 --> 02:57:18,050
Run if you can.

6097
02:57:18,110 --> 02:57:18,490
I'm trying.

6098
02:57:18,630 --> 02:57:19,330
I'm trying to run.

6099
02:57:19,610 --> 02:57:20,250
I'm dead though.

6100
02:57:20,250 --> 02:57:21,530
I think it's either you or me.

6101
02:57:22,210 --> 02:57:24,210
Yeah, if you guys split, they can't get all of us.

6102
02:57:24,550 --> 02:57:25,190
We're not splitting.

6103
02:57:25,270 --> 02:57:26,010
We're next to each other.

6104
02:57:28,310 --> 02:57:28,630
No!

6105
02:57:28,630 --> 02:57:28,990
No!

6106
02:57:29,170 --> 02:57:31,630
I'm in great second place!

6107
02:57:31,810 --> 02:57:33,090
They know it's us, dude.

6108
02:57:33,250 --> 02:57:34,150
They know it's us.

6109
02:57:34,950 --> 02:57:36,910
I think it's they know that we got white armor.

6110
02:57:37,150 --> 02:57:38,290
Because we didn't have evil.

6111
02:57:38,330 --> 02:57:39,390
Yeah, we had white armor.

6112
02:57:39,550 --> 02:57:39,930
Yes!

6113
02:57:40,410 --> 02:57:40,770
Damn!

6114
02:57:42,430 --> 02:57:43,710
Oh my god.

6115
02:57:43,790 --> 02:57:44,890
That's so stupid, bro.

6116
02:57:44,890 --> 02:57:47,170
They know we had white because we had no evil.

6117
02:57:47,990 --> 02:57:48,210
Yeah.

6118
02:57:48,370 --> 02:57:49,890
This is the fucking Ferelly boy kid.

6119
02:57:49,990 --> 02:57:51,870
Just a hard-stuck challenger circuit player.

6120
02:57:52,270 --> 02:57:52,710
Whoa!

6121
02:57:54,790 --> 02:57:55,410
It's true.

6122
02:57:55,530 --> 02:57:58,010
All he does is go to challenger circuit and get shit on in the finals.

6123
02:57:58,630 --> 02:58:00,770
Look, every god damn time, man.

6124
02:58:00,990 --> 02:58:02,350
Because this is how they play.

6125
02:58:02,710 --> 02:58:03,490
This is how they play.

6126
02:58:03,510 --> 02:58:05,090
They go to finals and get shit stomped.

6127
02:58:05,150 --> 02:58:05,770
It's just annoying.

6128
02:58:06,010 --> 02:58:06,570
Oh my god.

6129
02:58:06,610 --> 02:58:07,250
It's so frustrating.

6130
02:58:08,990 --> 02:58:09,510
That's okay.

6131
02:58:09,790 --> 02:58:13,490
You need five points a game to get into top ten.

6132
02:58:13,810 --> 02:58:15,230
We're still okay.

6133
02:58:16,050 --> 02:58:16,610
Don't worry.

6134
02:58:16,650 --> 02:58:17,490
We have two more games.

6135
02:58:17,610 --> 02:58:18,250
Wait, wait, wait.

6136
02:58:18,530 --> 02:58:19,910
This is only four.

6137
02:58:20,490 --> 02:58:21,270
Yeah, this is four.

6138
02:58:21,310 --> 02:58:21,950
We have two more games.

6139
02:58:22,210 --> 02:58:24,230
I think they land dome, right?

6140
02:58:24,810 --> 02:58:25,950
Yeah, they land dome.

6141
02:58:25,950 --> 02:58:28,370
Or no, they land launch site dome.

6142
02:58:28,450 --> 02:58:32,330
Yeah, so they're gonna be behind us every time.

6143
02:58:32,630 --> 02:58:34,670
Now we know we just gotta dip the fuck out immediately.

6144
02:58:34,990 --> 02:58:36,350
We should be fine.

6145
02:58:38,490 --> 02:58:40,210
Because we're storm point on the next one.

6146
02:58:40,290 --> 02:58:41,250
We're storm point for the next two.

6147
02:58:42,150 --> 02:58:45,510
If these guys are in the lobby again and they go launch site dome, we know they're gonna do that again.

6148
02:58:45,710 --> 02:58:46,730
Yeah, for round three.

6149
02:58:47,750 --> 02:58:48,470
Yeah, 100%.

6150
02:58:49,930 --> 02:58:50,490
You're good, bro.

6151
02:58:50,510 --> 02:58:50,750
Do your thing.

6152
02:58:50,870 --> 02:58:51,530
Fuck, man.

6153
02:58:51,550 --> 02:58:51,750
That sucks.

6154
02:58:52,830 --> 02:58:55,570
Because the right play for us there is to wait, to be honest.

6155
02:58:55,750 --> 02:58:58,270
Yeah, but they know that that's us too.

6156
02:58:58,370 --> 02:58:59,850
So they full sent it.

6157
02:59:00,470 --> 02:59:01,490
It's not a bad play.

6158
02:59:01,630 --> 02:59:03,570
I'm just salty, but overall it's just annoying.

6159
02:59:03,630 --> 02:59:06,870
Yeah, they know we had white too because we had no Evo.

6160
02:59:07,410 --> 02:59:08,390
Yeah, it's so rough.

6161
02:59:08,770 --> 02:59:10,930
The no player plan for us is pretty rough in that situation.

6162
02:59:11,230 --> 02:59:12,910
And also not having Evo cash in front.

6163
02:59:13,050 --> 02:59:13,970
Big mod is tough too.

6164
02:59:14,250 --> 02:59:14,470
Yeah.

6165
02:59:15,510 --> 02:59:19,430
I wonder if they were the same team that fucking ran at us last game too.

6166
02:59:19,710 --> 02:59:20,110
Yeah, yeah.

6167
02:59:20,290 --> 02:59:20,750
Were they?

6168
02:59:21,750 --> 02:59:23,050
I think it was because of the Horizon that landed on us.

6169
02:59:23,130 --> 02:59:23,530
Yeah, yeah.

6170
02:59:24,030 --> 02:59:26,770
I think that was the same team that landed on us.

6171
02:59:26,950 --> 02:59:28,310
So they'll always be like...

6172
02:59:28,310 --> 02:59:30,150
I think they'll always be like behind...

6173
02:59:30,590 --> 02:59:32,050
following us and mirroring us.

6174
02:59:33,050 --> 02:59:33,410
100%.

6175
02:59:33,410 --> 02:59:34,130
Without a doubt they will.

6176
02:59:37,770 --> 02:59:38,510
I'm pretty sure.

6177
02:59:40,610 --> 02:59:43,250
I think we just have to be faster in our rotation.

6178
02:59:43,550 --> 02:59:45,110
Because they'll always be behind us.

6179
02:59:45,150 --> 02:59:46,310
So we'll... we need to...

6180
02:59:46,770 --> 02:59:48,130
We just gotta get the dip the fuck out.

6181
02:59:48,210 --> 02:59:50,270
Yeah, dip the fuck out the moment we lose.

6182
02:59:50,710 --> 02:59:50,770
Yeah.

6183
02:59:50,810 --> 02:59:52,630
The only problem is though in the next round.

6184
02:59:53,890 --> 02:59:55,510
If we go to Worlds Edge and these guys are behind us.

6185
02:59:55,650 --> 02:59:56,850
If Big Mod doesn't rotate...

6186
02:59:56,850 --> 02:59:59,710
We might also not have stacks.

6187
02:59:59,930 --> 03:00:00,730
True, true, true.

6188
03:00:01,710 --> 03:00:03,650
Where do we want to go for Storm Point next two games?

6189
03:00:03,930 --> 03:00:04,530
What are we thinking?

6190
03:00:06,870 --> 03:00:07,430
I don't know.

6191
03:00:07,970 --> 03:00:08,650
I'm trying to... I'm trying to...

6192
03:00:08,650 --> 03:00:10,470
I think these guys land there.

6193
03:00:10,610 --> 03:00:14,370
Yeah, I think everything is going to be taken at Storm Point.

6194
03:00:14,490 --> 03:00:15,330
But we can still make it work.

6195
03:00:15,610 --> 03:00:17,050
Yeah, we'll see where it goes.

6196
03:00:17,050 --> 03:00:19,050
Has anyone... no one claimed stuff yet?

6197
03:00:19,110 --> 03:00:19,630
Right now?

6198
03:00:19,890 --> 03:00:20,390
They have.

6199
03:00:20,390 --> 03:00:20,890
They have.

6200
03:00:21,570 --> 03:00:23,050
But not everyone has.

6201
03:00:24,950 --> 03:00:27,310
Just when we think of all the spots that are free right now.

6202
03:00:28,850 --> 03:00:29,850
That's what I'm trying to think.

6203
03:00:30,090 --> 03:00:32,190
This guy just jumped off the fucking map almost, bro.

6204
03:00:32,410 --> 03:00:33,370
What am I watching?

6205
03:00:33,610 --> 03:00:34,370
Where's my...

6206
03:00:34,890 --> 03:00:36,510
Oh, I don't have it.

6207
03:00:36,590 --> 03:00:38,170
These guys are W-Keying everything.

6208
03:00:38,410 --> 03:00:39,130
Look at the...

6209
03:00:40,890 --> 03:00:42,110
This is what they do every time.

6210
03:00:42,150 --> 03:00:43,890
They just literally never make it anywhere.

6211
03:00:44,230 --> 03:00:45,730
Because you can't W-Key everything.

6212
03:00:46,990 --> 03:00:47,410
Exactly.

6213
03:00:47,410 --> 03:00:47,530
They just straight around.

6214
03:00:47,690 --> 03:00:47,910
Exactly.

6215
03:00:52,310 --> 03:00:52,890
It's okay.

6216
03:00:53,070 --> 03:00:56,630
They have the sick ass rank mindset.

6217
03:00:56,890 --> 03:00:57,390
Oh, he's dead.

6218
03:00:58,390 --> 03:00:59,190
Come on.

6219
03:00:59,290 --> 03:01:00,110
Wait, they're dead.

6220
03:01:00,690 --> 03:01:02,070
What did they die to?

6221
03:01:03,130 --> 03:01:04,050
Nice job, guys.

6222
03:01:04,210 --> 03:01:04,890
Seriously, great play.

6223
03:01:06,130 --> 03:01:07,730
They died to an actual team?

6224
03:01:08,830 --> 03:01:09,230
I'm not salty at all.

6225
03:01:09,230 --> 03:01:10,010
Yeah, I'm not salty at all, guys.

6226
03:01:10,070 --> 03:01:10,330
No worries.

6227
03:01:11,710 --> 03:01:13,030
Bro, they died to...

6228
03:01:14,190 --> 03:01:15,090
These guys just...

6229
03:01:15,090 --> 03:01:16,990
They play like it's ranked every game.

6230
03:01:17,410 --> 03:01:17,630
That's right.

6231
03:01:17,850 --> 03:01:18,270
Yeah.

6232
03:01:20,250 --> 03:01:21,910
They died to like...

6233
03:01:22,350 --> 03:01:22,910
I'm sorry.

6234
03:01:23,150 --> 03:01:25,130
They died to nobodies?

6235
03:01:26,510 --> 03:01:28,170
There's somebodies in someone's heart.

6236
03:01:28,790 --> 03:01:29,910
Road Knife is good.

6237
03:01:30,090 --> 03:01:31,430
I know him.

6238
03:01:31,690 --> 03:01:32,250
Oh, you know him?

6239
03:01:32,770 --> 03:01:33,490
Yeah, he's pretty good.

6240
03:01:33,870 --> 03:01:35,870
Wait, am I watching the same team as you?

6241
03:01:36,310 --> 03:01:37,030
I think so.

6242
03:01:39,870 --> 03:01:41,390
Yeah, Road Knife is really good.

6243
03:01:41,550 --> 03:01:41,850
Oh, okay.

6244
03:01:41,930 --> 03:01:44,090
So they died to somebodies.

6245
03:01:44,770 --> 03:01:46,550
I mean, compare to us, everybody.

6246
03:01:49,290 --> 03:01:51,410
I think everybody's everybody and we're nobodies.

6247
03:01:51,950 --> 03:01:53,650
Yeah, we're the nobodies here.

6248
03:01:53,690 --> 03:01:54,650
Yeah, 100%.

6249
03:01:54,650 --> 03:01:56,350
We're the underdogs.

6250
03:01:57,430 --> 03:01:57,830
100%.

6251
03:01:59,390 --> 03:02:00,390
Follow for follow?

6252
03:02:02,710 --> 03:02:03,390
Revive for revive?

6253
03:02:04,890 --> 03:02:05,910
What do you think...

6254
03:02:07,110 --> 03:02:09,910
Okay, so Tempo, how are you knowing where people are going?

6255
03:02:10,010 --> 03:02:11,170
Are they typing in like a Discord or something?

6256
03:02:11,530 --> 03:02:12,030
Oh, no.

6257
03:02:12,090 --> 03:02:13,710
They were typing in game chat.

6258
03:02:13,930 --> 03:02:15,470
Yeah, like they were typing the...

6259
03:02:15,470 --> 03:02:17,390
Like they were doing all the dropouts.

6260
03:02:17,790 --> 03:02:18,370
Oh, shit.

6261
03:02:18,430 --> 03:02:20,050
You're calculating that through game chat?

6262
03:02:20,130 --> 03:02:21,090
That's actually pretty crazy.

6263
03:02:21,190 --> 03:02:23,550
I was just writing down...

6264
03:02:24,790 --> 03:02:25,530
I was just writing down...

6265
03:02:25,530 --> 03:02:26,190
I was just writing down...

6266
03:02:27,390 --> 03:02:29,050
Crossing out all the stuff on the map.

6267
03:02:29,650 --> 03:02:30,370
He's analyzing.

6268
03:02:31,290 --> 03:02:31,830
God damn.

6269
03:02:31,930 --> 03:02:32,210
Thank you.

6270
03:02:32,230 --> 03:02:35,490
This is why we have Tempo.

6271
03:02:35,990 --> 03:02:38,030
Let's just double check when we swap maps here.

6272
03:02:38,290 --> 03:02:39,570
Well, that was a learning game for us.

6273
03:02:39,670 --> 03:02:40,810
Now we know we gotta leave quick.

6274
03:02:40,850 --> 03:02:41,430
We don't have anything.

6275
03:02:41,650 --> 03:02:42,010
Yeah.

6276
03:02:43,110 --> 03:02:44,550
We just have to make it to the next round.

6277
03:02:44,570 --> 03:02:46,210
I think we have stuff we have to leave quick.

6278
03:02:46,270 --> 03:02:46,850
Because their team...

6279
03:02:47,570 --> 03:02:49,550
Yeah, because they'll just be right behind us.

6280
03:02:49,670 --> 03:02:51,850
Yeah, and also no offense to any of us here.

6281
03:02:51,930 --> 03:02:52,990
They're just gonna beat us 3v3.

6282
03:02:52,990 --> 03:02:53,390
Yeah, no.

6283
03:02:53,670 --> 03:02:54,030
100%.

6284
03:02:54,030 --> 03:02:54,590
You're gonna win.

6285
03:02:54,690 --> 03:02:55,890
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

6286
03:02:55,890 --> 03:02:56,230
I have a plan.

6287
03:02:56,610 --> 03:02:58,470
Okay, okay.

6288
03:02:58,590 --> 03:02:59,190
Next round.

6289
03:02:59,410 --> 03:03:01,170
Assuming no one goes stacks, and we do.

6290
03:03:01,590 --> 03:03:01,950
Right?

6291
03:03:03,410 --> 03:03:04,870
We hide in one of the buildings.

6292
03:03:05,010 --> 03:03:06,150
And we rat those fucks.

6293
03:03:07,310 --> 03:03:08,730
And then we kill one.

6294
03:03:08,750 --> 03:03:09,570
And then we kill one.

6295
03:03:10,630 --> 03:03:11,770
We kill one.

6296
03:03:11,870 --> 03:03:13,390
And then we can't lose 3v2.

6297
03:03:13,450 --> 03:03:13,650
Right?

6298
03:03:13,650 --> 03:03:15,170
We're still gonna lose.

6299
03:03:15,410 --> 03:03:17,790
I think we win a 3v2.

6300
03:03:17,990 --> 03:03:18,190
Right?

6301
03:03:18,270 --> 03:03:18,790
Same armor.

6302
03:03:20,950 --> 03:03:23,410
Assuming there's no armor diff, I think we can win 3v2.

6303
03:03:23,530 --> 03:03:23,690
No, no.

6304
03:03:25,250 --> 03:03:26,930
I think we'll win a 3v1.

6305
03:03:27,530 --> 03:03:28,570
I'm confident that.

6306
03:03:29,210 --> 03:03:29,610
3v2?

6307
03:03:29,730 --> 03:03:30,390
I don't know.

6308
03:03:30,590 --> 03:03:31,630
No, I think we can do 3v2.

6309
03:03:31,910 --> 03:03:34,070
Okay, this is what you do.

6310
03:03:34,210 --> 03:03:35,610
When we rat them, and we kill one.

6311
03:03:36,090 --> 03:03:37,890
We gotta use that initial...

6312
03:03:37,890 --> 03:03:41,230
like, two seconds of confusion that goes through their brain.

6313
03:03:41,350 --> 03:03:42,330
And then kill the second one.

6314
03:03:42,430 --> 03:03:43,350
And then it's a 3v1.

6315
03:03:43,650 --> 03:03:44,110
Alright?

6316
03:03:44,990 --> 03:03:45,610
That's the plan.

6317
03:03:45,770 --> 03:03:47,730
You gotta use psychological battles.

6318
03:03:47,830 --> 03:03:49,610
We're gonna use the psychological battles here?

6319
03:03:49,650 --> 03:03:52,570
We have two seconds after we rat one to kill the second.

6320
03:03:52,710 --> 03:03:53,590
Cause they will be confused.

6321
03:03:55,570 --> 03:03:56,370
Unless they're...

6322
03:03:56,370 --> 03:03:59,090
Are we really gonna risk our one game for that?

6323
03:03:59,670 --> 03:04:00,550
I think we do.

6324
03:04:00,650 --> 03:04:03,770
I think we do it, and then we teabag the shit out of them.

6325
03:04:04,170 --> 03:04:04,750
Okay, wait.

6326
03:04:04,830 --> 03:04:06,530
Do you think that's a smart thing to do?

6327
03:04:06,650 --> 03:04:08,910
Our two games that we have left?

6328
03:04:09,370 --> 03:04:09,990
No, no, no.

6329
03:04:10,070 --> 03:04:10,710
It's next round.

6330
03:04:11,430 --> 03:04:13,510
It's when we make it to next round.

6331
03:04:13,650 --> 03:04:14,410
Okay, okay.

6332
03:04:14,470 --> 03:04:15,410
If we make it to the next round.

6333
03:04:15,590 --> 03:04:17,990
If we make it to the next round, we take...

6334
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:19,570
Cause we're not on World's Edge anymore, right?

6335
03:04:19,630 --> 03:04:21,210
If we make it to the next round, we take stacks.

6336
03:04:21,450 --> 03:04:22,590
We rat them in a building.

6337
03:04:22,830 --> 03:04:25,230
Then we kill one from getting ratted.

6338
03:04:25,290 --> 03:04:28,330
Then we kill the second in the next, like, three seconds from confusion.

6339
03:04:28,730 --> 03:04:30,170
And then it becomes a 3v1.

6340
03:04:30,370 --> 03:04:30,890
Oh, come on!

6341
03:04:31,130 --> 03:04:31,670
Yeah, yeah.

6342
03:04:31,950 --> 03:04:34,450
Cause they'll have, like, three seconds of brain delay.

6343
03:04:34,950 --> 03:04:37,490
When they're like, what just happened?

6344
03:04:37,590 --> 03:04:38,510
And who just ratted?

6345
03:04:38,570 --> 03:04:39,490
And who's where and what?

6346
03:04:40,050 --> 03:04:40,410
Right?

6347
03:04:40,410 --> 03:04:43,870
And then we use that delay to kill the second person.

6348
03:04:44,370 --> 03:04:46,070
And then it's 3v1.

6349
03:04:46,290 --> 03:04:48,050
And after we kill them, we teabag them.

6350
03:04:48,730 --> 03:04:49,370
Oh, wow.

6351
03:04:49,630 --> 03:04:49,950
You think...

6352
03:04:50,550 --> 03:04:53,570
He's thinking so ahead in the future right there.

6353
03:04:54,630 --> 03:04:57,590
That's also crazy cause that's just an if we win.

6354
03:04:58,110 --> 03:04:58,830
What do you mean?

6355
03:04:58,910 --> 03:04:59,550
That's when we win.

6356
03:04:59,930 --> 03:05:01,210
We definitely get one.

6357
03:05:01,730 --> 03:05:03,710
It's 100% we get one if we rat.

6358
03:05:03,950 --> 03:05:10,330
It's like 70% we get the second one in the matter of, like, in the confusion and all the stuff.

6359
03:05:10,470 --> 03:05:11,290
The confusion again.

6360
03:05:11,470 --> 03:05:11,730
Yeah.

6361
03:05:12,050 --> 03:05:12,990
That's seven... yeah.

6362
03:05:13,570 --> 03:05:14,870
Confusion is super effective.

6363
03:05:16,930 --> 03:05:19,550
Confusion is super effective depending on who you're fighting.

6364
03:05:21,430 --> 03:05:24,410
The problem is I don't think this works IRL sadly.

6365
03:05:24,790 --> 03:05:26,310
Yo, it's three controller players.

6366
03:05:26,530 --> 03:05:26,730
Okay?

6367
03:05:27,230 --> 03:05:27,750
Confusion...

6368
03:05:29,530 --> 03:05:30,050
Confusion...

6369
03:05:30,050 --> 03:05:33,530
This is exactly why I don't think we're gonna win a 2v3.

6370
03:05:34,330 --> 03:05:37,790
Confusion probability for controller players is much higher than MNK.

6371
03:05:38,350 --> 03:05:39,470
Three controller players.

6372
03:05:39,690 --> 03:05:42,370
And that's like why I think we won't win a 2v2.

6373
03:05:42,370 --> 03:05:45,650
Instead of Tempo just shooting his gun he's gonna think about how to confuse the players.

6374
03:05:45,930 --> 03:05:46,150
Yeah.

6375
03:05:46,990 --> 03:05:51,250
He's gonna die with 13 damage be like, bro I got them so stomped that no one knew what was going on.

6376
03:05:51,330 --> 03:05:52,810
I gave them PTSD now.

6377
03:05:52,810 --> 03:05:54,570
Yo, they're so lost they don't know what's going on.

6378
03:05:54,730 --> 03:05:59,310
Bro, I gave them PTSD they're gonna be like, check every fucking building now because of us.

6379
03:05:59,410 --> 03:05:59,750
Yeah, exactly.

6380
03:05:59,990 --> 03:06:02,990
And then, you know what happens when they have to check every little building?

6381
03:06:03,110 --> 03:06:03,790
They get slow.

6382
03:06:04,870 --> 03:06:06,630
And then we can get ahead of them next time.

6383
03:06:06,830 --> 03:06:07,990
You're so smart.

6384
03:06:08,210 --> 03:06:08,890
Honestly.

6385
03:06:09,110 --> 03:06:10,430
You're also so dumb.

6386
03:06:10,590 --> 03:06:10,950
It's unreal.

6387
03:06:11,190 --> 03:06:11,630
I love it.

6388
03:06:11,730 --> 03:06:13,330
I thought I loved you so much.

6389
03:06:15,830 --> 03:06:17,330
See, I'm just dumb all around.

6390
03:06:17,770 --> 03:06:22,230
But like Tempo here he tries to hide his dumbness.

6391
03:06:22,290 --> 03:06:23,290
What do you mean hide?

6392
03:06:25,190 --> 03:06:27,770
Hey, my brain is still here, okay?

6393
03:06:28,110 --> 03:06:31,290
My brain only disappears when I go to when I go...

6394
03:06:31,850 --> 03:06:33,770
We literally play Apex Legends.

6395
03:06:33,870 --> 03:06:34,710
We don't have rings.

6396
03:06:35,710 --> 03:06:36,350
Yeah, true.

6397
03:06:38,210 --> 03:06:38,350
Come on.

6398
03:06:38,350 --> 03:06:42,870
After the first two years of Apex, it's fucking long going.

6399
03:06:43,390 --> 03:06:44,350
You're so wrong.

6400
03:06:44,550 --> 03:06:45,670
You're so correct.

6401
03:06:46,450 --> 03:06:49,090
Once you play Apex for two years, you just automatically are dumber.

6402
03:06:49,190 --> 03:06:49,870
That's just how it goes.

6403
03:06:50,630 --> 03:06:52,010
No, that's only controller players.

6404
03:06:52,470 --> 03:06:55,250
They get affected twice as hard.

6405
03:06:55,610 --> 03:06:56,010
They get affected twice as hard.

6406
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:57,090
I actually think you might be right, bro.

6407
03:06:57,110 --> 03:06:59,370
I have definitely gotten way dumber when I first started.

6408
03:06:59,370 --> 03:07:00,310
Wait a minute.

6409
03:07:00,450 --> 03:07:01,670
I'm a controller player.

6410
03:07:02,230 --> 03:07:03,410
I was pretty smart, bro.

6411
03:07:04,670 --> 03:07:06,170
And I'm not smart anymore.

6412
03:07:06,170 --> 03:07:06,770
That's for sure.

6413
03:07:08,210 --> 03:07:09,310
I used to be smart, too.

6414
03:07:09,310 --> 03:07:10,070
I've done some Apex Legends, bro, on stream.

6415
03:07:12,770 --> 03:07:15,870
I said that streaming is like the bimbo modification.

6416
03:07:16,250 --> 03:07:16,610
Oh, wait.

6417
03:07:16,610 --> 03:07:16,610
Are you one of those...

6418
03:07:16,610 --> 03:07:18,550
One of those, are you smarter than a fifth grader things?

6419
03:07:18,730 --> 03:07:19,690
Yeah, have you ever taken one of those?

6420
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:20,430
No.

6421
03:07:20,670 --> 03:07:21,730
I don't think I've ever passed it, bro.

6422
03:07:21,770 --> 03:07:22,110
I'm not kidding.

6423
03:07:22,310 --> 03:07:22,790
Wait, really?

6424
03:07:23,070 --> 03:07:23,490
You took...

6425
03:07:23,490 --> 03:07:25,350
Wait, how far did you get?

6426
03:07:25,870 --> 03:07:29,010
If it has like geography and stuff in it, I'm just confused.

6427
03:07:29,550 --> 03:07:30,510
Geography is fucking stupid.

6428
03:07:30,630 --> 03:07:31,830
Why do we need to know where things are?

6429
03:07:32,530 --> 03:07:32,890
Exactly.

6430
03:07:33,850 --> 03:07:35,470
Honestly, low key, it's been a little bit.

6431
03:07:35,470 --> 03:07:36,690
If I'm not traveling, why do I need to know?

6432
03:07:36,770 --> 03:07:37,350
Yeah, exactly.

6433
03:07:37,770 --> 03:07:38,870
We just need to know where we're going.

6434
03:07:38,870 --> 03:07:39,630
Even if I am traveling, I have Google.

6435
03:07:41,170 --> 03:07:41,490
Google?

6436
03:07:41,910 --> 03:07:42,890
Yeah, we have Google.

6437
03:07:43,030 --> 03:07:45,070
We can just Google where to go.

6438
03:07:45,110 --> 03:07:45,610
We have GPS.

6439
03:07:45,810 --> 03:07:47,130
Why the fuck do we need geography?

6440
03:07:48,170 --> 03:07:51,730
To be fair, though, when I was in Japan, I literally just Google translated everything with pictures.

6441
03:07:52,070 --> 03:07:52,530
Yeah, exactly.

6442
03:07:53,530 --> 03:07:53,850
Yeah.

6443
03:07:53,950 --> 03:07:54,610
That's not geography.

6444
03:07:54,830 --> 03:07:56,710
I mean, that has nothing to do with geography, but yeah.

6445
03:07:56,870 --> 03:07:57,190
Exactly.

6446
03:07:57,950 --> 03:07:58,270
Yeah, I'm saying.

6447
03:08:01,430 --> 03:08:04,490
Yeah, I'm learning Japanese so we can, uh, when we go again.

6448
03:08:04,750 --> 03:08:06,530
I can IGL us in Japan.

6449
03:08:07,210 --> 03:08:08,910
Well, you can just IGL us in English.

6450
03:08:09,150 --> 03:08:09,790
Like, what do you...

6451
03:08:10,530 --> 03:08:13,970
Well, no, I gotta be able to talk Japanese so that I can IGL us.

6452
03:08:14,270 --> 03:08:14,310
Oh!

6453
03:08:14,830 --> 03:08:17,090
I was gonna be like, we're still gonna be playing the same...

6454
03:08:17,090 --> 03:08:19,390
Let me talk to you in Japanese, okay?

6455
03:08:19,570 --> 03:08:23,590
No, I thought you meant like, we're gonna be like in Japan playing Apex or something.

6456
03:08:23,730 --> 03:08:24,470
I was like, what do you mean?

6457
03:08:24,530 --> 03:08:26,270
We're still gonna be talking in English.

6458
03:08:27,250 --> 03:08:27,610
I'm sorry.

6459
03:08:27,890 --> 03:08:28,250
I'm sorry.

6460
03:08:28,850 --> 03:08:29,210
Uh...

6461
03:08:30,870 --> 03:08:32,390
Uh, it's too funny, bro.

6462
03:08:33,610 --> 03:08:35,710
I just literally take pictures of everything I do now.

6463
03:08:35,990 --> 03:08:36,730
You know what's crazy?

6464
03:08:36,790 --> 03:08:39,130
I worked out in Japan, like a park.

6465
03:08:39,490 --> 03:08:42,970
And there was like yellow tape, but like not really yellow tape on the thing that says like caution.

6466
03:08:42,970 --> 03:08:43,630
Did you go to the...

6467
03:08:44,050 --> 03:08:45,970
Did you ever end up going to the One Punch Man place?

6468
03:08:46,330 --> 03:08:47,150
You mean One Piece?

6469
03:08:47,450 --> 03:08:48,190
One Piece Man?

6470
03:08:48,370 --> 03:08:51,830
One Piece Man is crazy.

6471
03:08:52,890 --> 03:08:54,370
I did not go to the One Piece gym.

6472
03:08:55,370 --> 03:08:55,870
What's that?

6473
03:08:55,870 --> 03:08:56,110
I jumped.

6474
03:08:57,170 --> 03:08:59,730
Okay, next time we go, we definitely have to make that a priority.

6475
03:08:59,910 --> 03:09:00,550
Because I wanted to go.

6476
03:09:00,850 --> 03:09:02,890
Wait, what happened to my Nessie plushie?

6477
03:09:02,950 --> 03:09:04,350
You said you'd give me a Nessie plushie.

6478
03:09:04,430 --> 03:09:04,950
Where is it?

6479
03:09:05,270 --> 03:09:06,410
I'll see you at LAN, right?

6480
03:09:06,570 --> 03:09:07,090
Where is it?

6481
03:09:07,650 --> 03:09:08,550
I have it.

6482
03:09:10,450 --> 03:09:12,330
Yeah, I'm digitally gonna go to LAN.

6483
03:09:13,750 --> 03:09:16,190
Wait, who's gonna grab the iPad and the...

6484
03:09:16,190 --> 03:09:17,370
the roller stuff?

6485
03:09:17,650 --> 03:09:18,670
Well, I have a tablet.

6486
03:09:18,750 --> 03:09:19,950
I just don't have a rolly thing.

6487
03:09:20,170 --> 03:09:21,450
Wait, how much is a rolly thing?

6488
03:09:22,150 --> 03:09:23,090
I have no clue.

6489
03:09:23,290 --> 03:09:24,570
Hey, you had a level 10 wave trick.

6490
03:09:24,670 --> 03:09:25,430
You can send us a...

6491
03:09:25,870 --> 03:09:26,470
Wait, wait a minute.

6492
03:09:26,610 --> 03:09:27,410
Wait, wait, wait.

6493
03:09:27,510 --> 03:09:29,790
Doki had a level 10 offline hype train.

6494
03:09:30,190 --> 03:09:30,630
Let's see if Apex will sponsor.

6495
03:09:30,750 --> 03:09:34,070
Let's ask if Apex will sponsor a rolly thing for us.

6496
03:09:34,210 --> 03:09:34,850
It'll be content.

6497
03:09:35,130 --> 03:09:36,390
A rolly thing would be content.

6498
03:09:36,630 --> 03:09:37,570
It would be so content.

6499
03:09:37,710 --> 03:09:42,790
You know how in Japan you guys were on that platform thing for B-stream?

6500
03:09:43,050 --> 03:09:43,490
Yeah.

6501
03:09:43,730 --> 03:09:47,390
Imagine just having Doki just zooming around in the background and then she falls off the stage.

6502
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:49,630
Imagine just having Doki just zooming around in the background and then she falls off the stage.

6503
03:09:49,810 --> 03:09:50,710
She's like drifting.

6504
03:09:51,050 --> 03:09:53,890
Her little avatar has a bandit on the forehead.

6505
03:09:54,130 --> 03:09:54,410
Yeah.

6506
03:09:55,870 --> 03:09:56,530
She's drifting too hard.

6507
03:09:56,590 --> 03:09:57,790
She just leads herself off.

6508
03:09:58,150 --> 03:09:59,450
That was so funny.

6509
03:09:59,570 --> 03:10:00,730
That was so funny.

6510
03:10:02,070 --> 03:10:03,310
Okay, okay, okay.

6511
03:10:03,550 --> 03:10:06,270
They sent it while Tempo was on the roof.

6512
03:10:06,530 --> 03:10:07,130
True, bro.

6513
03:10:07,190 --> 03:10:08,830
Tempo, you and Roofs are cursed, brother.

6514
03:10:09,010 --> 03:10:09,530
That's so true.

6515
03:10:10,110 --> 03:10:11,930
Wait, weren't you on the roof when they shot you?

6516
03:10:12,110 --> 03:10:12,470
Yes.

6517
03:10:12,730 --> 03:10:13,610
Yeah, that's right.

6518
03:10:13,930 --> 03:10:15,450
Yeah, and also you were about to.

6519
03:10:15,690 --> 03:10:17,330
We should just get off the roof.

6520
03:10:18,150 --> 03:10:20,550
I should have just charge rifled them off the thing.

6521
03:10:21,250 --> 03:10:23,810
I didn't charge rifle them because I thought they were going to fly away.

6522
03:10:24,050 --> 03:10:24,450
True.

6523
03:10:24,510 --> 03:10:25,850
But then I should have realized it's through.

6524
03:10:25,870 --> 03:10:26,530
They have three controller clears.

6525
03:10:26,770 --> 03:10:27,810
No, you're spitting for real.

6526
03:10:29,070 --> 03:10:34,390
Okay, so like who's going to ask Apex to sponsor us for the Rooftop?

6527
03:10:34,490 --> 03:10:35,370
You, you have the most pull.

6528
03:10:35,510 --> 03:10:35,750
What?

6529
03:10:35,750 --> 03:10:37,130
Just really?

6530
03:10:37,530 --> 03:10:38,730
On the B-stream.

6531
03:10:39,450 --> 03:10:41,230
You just got a level 10 hypechain all of a sudden.

6532
03:10:41,230 --> 03:10:41,230
Yeah.

6533
03:10:41,230 --> 03:10:42,230
You got a level 10 hypechain.

6534
03:10:43,110 --> 03:10:45,170
Isn't your hypechain even higher now?

6535
03:10:45,550 --> 03:10:48,050
Yes, it's unlimited now.

6536
03:10:48,110 --> 03:10:48,670
It's uncapped.

6537
03:10:49,410 --> 03:10:49,970
Oh, no.

6538
03:10:50,030 --> 03:10:55,850
I mean, isn't it like higher for your stream to go to level 10 hypechain compared to like an Apex?

6539
03:10:55,850 --> 03:10:59,790
We probably made more in that level 10 high train than I do to get paid to get to the B stream.

6540
03:11:00,070 --> 03:11:00,510
Yeah.

6541
03:11:02,430 --> 03:11:03,570
Okay, but like... I've talked to you.

6542
03:11:03,570 --> 03:11:04,270
Hey, at least you're getting paid.

6543
03:11:04,310 --> 03:11:05,650
I'm just going there for free.

6544
03:11:05,810 --> 03:11:10,090
We could get like Apex to sponsor it, which means none of us have to pay.

6545
03:11:10,690 --> 03:11:11,650
Okay, yeah yeah.

6546
03:11:11,750 --> 03:11:13,070
You go ask EA.

6547
03:11:13,310 --> 03:11:15,210
Wait, why do I... Wig literally works for...

6548
03:11:15,210 --> 03:11:16,090
Because you have the most pull.

6549
03:11:16,570 --> 03:11:18,210
Wig literally works for B stream!

6550
03:11:18,530 --> 03:11:20,010
How do I have the most pull?

6551
03:11:20,750 --> 03:11:21,990
Because content creators.

6552
03:11:22,270 --> 03:11:22,910
More pull.

6553
03:11:23,390 --> 03:11:25,430
Wig is also a content creator!

6554
03:11:26,370 --> 03:11:28,010
Wig is a host and caster.

6555
03:11:28,970 --> 03:11:29,630
I'm a host.

6556
03:11:29,830 --> 03:11:30,390
I'm a co-host.

6557
03:11:30,490 --> 03:11:31,110
You're not even a host.

6558
03:11:31,170 --> 03:11:31,690
I'm a co-host.

6559
03:11:31,910 --> 03:11:35,950
Yeah, so then you can like... you have the most pull because you literally work for Apex.

6560
03:11:36,810 --> 03:11:37,510
Alright guys.

6561
03:11:38,570 --> 03:11:39,590
We're in 8th.

6562
03:11:39,670 --> 03:11:41,850
We didn't... we're not 10th yet, so we're good.

6563
03:11:42,850 --> 03:11:43,730
Jesus Christ.

6564
03:11:43,950 --> 03:11:45,950
Zone Davis has 43 points.

6565
03:11:46,270 --> 03:11:47,010
We're not in 10th?

6566
03:11:47,270 --> 03:11:48,070
We're in 8th place.

6567
03:11:48,470 --> 03:11:49,490
Let's fucking go guys!

6568
03:11:49,490 --> 03:11:49,990
This is good.

6569
03:11:50,070 --> 03:11:50,350
This is good.

6570
03:11:50,530 --> 03:11:51,850
Okay, we set two more games.

6571
03:11:51,850 --> 03:11:52,410
Now we gotta...

6572
03:11:52,910 --> 03:11:53,890
We gotta plan for round 3.

6573
03:11:53,970 --> 03:11:54,890
Now we can't fuck up.

6574
03:11:54,890 --> 03:11:58,130
So, you know, you know, boys, if you guys... if you guys are listening, that's right.

6575
03:11:58,430 --> 03:12:00,330
You might wanna double check every single room.

6576
03:12:00,430 --> 03:12:01,770
And then this... you know what this is?

6577
03:12:01,890 --> 03:12:05,790
If they are listening, then they'll double check every single room.

6578
03:12:05,850 --> 03:12:06,170
Wait, I thought we're doing...

6579
03:12:06,170 --> 03:12:06,530
So they'll be slow.

6580
03:12:06,870 --> 03:12:08,510
I thought we're doing that in round 3.

6581
03:12:09,190 --> 03:12:09,550
They'll be slow to catch up to us.

6582
03:12:09,550 --> 03:12:10,470
Yeah, that's what I mean.

6583
03:12:10,870 --> 03:12:11,450
Oh, okay.

6584
03:12:11,530 --> 03:12:13,110
I thought... I was like, we're not doing it in this round.

6585
03:12:13,170 --> 03:12:13,610
What the fuck?

6586
03:12:14,430 --> 03:12:16,630
JK, we're actually... we actually are here listening.

6587
03:12:16,810 --> 03:12:17,750
We actually are, guys.

6588
03:12:18,470 --> 03:12:23,990
So, if they're listening and we are actually routing them, then now they have to check every single corner.

6589
03:12:24,030 --> 03:12:24,230
Yeah.

6590
03:12:24,230 --> 03:12:28,110
So, even if they're trying to push us quick in big mod, they'll be slower now.

6591
03:12:28,290 --> 03:12:29,210
That's fucking right.

6592
03:12:29,370 --> 03:12:31,050
Check every fucking corner.

6593
03:12:31,530 --> 03:12:32,770
Cause we could be...

6594
03:12:32,770 --> 03:12:34,630
Yeah, clear the corners, guys.

6595
03:12:34,650 --> 03:12:35,610
Guys, check your DMs.

6596
03:12:35,890 --> 03:12:36,770
Check your DMs.

6597
03:12:39,230 --> 03:12:40,290
Alright, let's fucking go.

6598
03:12:40,310 --> 03:12:41,870
This is our real plan, guys.

6599
03:12:41,910 --> 03:12:42,430
Check your DMs.

6600
03:12:42,770 --> 03:12:43,410
This is our real plan.

6601
03:12:43,430 --> 03:12:44,270
I'm checking my DMs.

6602
03:12:44,270 --> 03:12:46,490
Whoa, that is such a great plan, Dempo.

6603
03:12:46,690 --> 03:12:50,510
I'm waiting for them to type the thingy where they're going.

6604
03:12:50,510 --> 03:12:51,670
How did you write that much?

6605
03:12:51,790 --> 03:12:54,270
In such a long... in such a short amount of time.

6606
03:12:54,530 --> 03:12:56,230
That is like so much knowledge.

6607
03:12:56,910 --> 03:12:58,530
You're so smart, little man.

6608
03:12:58,630 --> 03:12:59,470
So proud of you.

6609
03:13:00,510 --> 03:13:01,930
Alrighty, let's fucking log it in.

6610
03:13:02,010 --> 03:13:03,490
Alright, let's figure out where the fuck we're going here, yeah?

6611
03:13:03,690 --> 03:13:03,690
Oh, god.

6612
03:13:05,050 --> 03:13:05,530
Cascade.

6613
03:13:05,890 --> 03:13:06,370
Zeus.

6614
03:13:07,270 --> 03:13:11,570
I am a little high and the delay plus wig typing and chat is absolutely breaking my brain.

6615
03:13:12,450 --> 03:13:15,590
Yo, someone fucking typed tree and we're on storm point.

6616
03:13:15,830 --> 03:13:17,230
I think they've lost it.

6617
03:13:18,210 --> 03:13:18,690
Launchpad.

6618
03:13:19,350 --> 03:13:19,830
Cascades.

6619
03:13:19,930 --> 03:13:20,650
C note.

6620
03:13:20,890 --> 03:13:21,470
C note.

6621
03:13:23,110 --> 03:13:23,470
Beast.

6622
03:13:27,110 --> 03:13:30,570
Okay, checkpoint and stormcatcher.

6623
03:13:37,400 --> 03:13:38,400
Alright, let's see...

6624
03:13:38,400 --> 03:13:40,160
Did team 2 type where they were going?

6625
03:13:40,480 --> 03:13:40,980
Team 2.

6626
03:13:41,060 --> 03:13:41,760
Oh no, I have no idea.

6627
03:13:41,840 --> 03:13:42,880
Let's get the fuck away from them, bro.

6628
03:13:43,180 --> 03:13:45,060
I am not trying to go down with a sinking ship.

6629
03:13:45,160 --> 03:13:46,460
They haven't typed yet.

6630
03:13:47,420 --> 03:13:47,780
Okay.

6631
03:13:48,020 --> 03:13:48,980
They just got in.

6632
03:13:49,120 --> 03:13:53,220
Alright, so we got pylon wall and checkpoint still open.

6633
03:13:54,120 --> 03:13:54,480
Open.

6634
03:13:54,640 --> 03:13:54,740
Open.

6635
03:13:55,700 --> 03:13:57,700
Or our favorite POI.

6636
03:13:57,700 --> 03:13:58,920
I'm on CeloDraft.

6637
03:14:00,200 --> 03:14:00,760
Yeah.

6638
03:14:02,340 --> 03:14:04,820
Maybe because it's surrounded by scary people.

6639
03:14:05,240 --> 03:14:09,800
Doesn't the boys do exactly what Legacy does all the time?

6640
03:14:10,080 --> 03:14:10,640
I'm not sure.

6641
03:14:10,780 --> 03:14:12,300
Why would they do exactly what they do?

6642
03:14:13,280 --> 03:14:15,880
Because they both ape everything.

6643
03:14:16,140 --> 03:14:19,280
So they both also land at the same POIs, I feel like.

6644
03:14:21,700 --> 03:14:25,260
Yo guys, chicken, plum or meatball marinara?

6645
03:14:29,020 --> 03:14:31,740
Chicken, brie, cranberry.

6646
03:14:34,860 --> 03:14:36,300
You're fucking bougie.

6647
03:14:38,220 --> 03:14:39,280
Bougie motherfucker, man.

6648
03:14:41,120 --> 03:14:42,880
And the bread has to...

6649
03:14:45,920 --> 03:14:47,420
Look at that take from that guy.

6650
03:14:47,500 --> 03:14:47,840
I like that.

6651
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:48,500
Good friend.

6652
03:14:48,700 --> 03:14:49,260
It was good.

6653
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:51,580
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

6654
03:14:51,980 --> 03:14:53,340
Maybe that's a crazy thing.

6655
03:14:53,520 --> 03:14:55,100
Only 12 POIs are claimed.

6656
03:14:55,380 --> 03:14:57,340
I feel like there's just no way pylon's free.

6657
03:14:57,480 --> 03:14:58,200
I gotta be honest here.

6658
03:14:58,600 --> 03:15:00,260
Okay, well we still have check...

6659
03:15:00,260 --> 03:15:05,900
Someone... I remember someone typing wall when we were on World's Edge.

6660
03:15:06,040 --> 03:15:07,940
So let's just pretend wall is gone.

6661
03:15:08,500 --> 03:15:08,880
Okay.

6662
03:15:09,020 --> 03:15:10,740
So we got checkpoint pylon Jurassic.

6663
03:15:12,740 --> 03:15:14,460
There's no way somebody takes Jurassic.

6664
03:15:14,540 --> 03:15:15,520
It's such a shit place.

6665
03:15:15,640 --> 03:15:16,820
Coastal and Devastated.

6666
03:15:20,880 --> 03:15:23,800
No one's typing landing spots anymore.

6667
03:15:26,440 --> 03:15:27,840
No one's about it anymore?

6668
03:15:28,240 --> 03:15:30,880
No one's talking about where to land.

6669
03:15:31,960 --> 03:15:32,800
Yeah, I don't know.

6670
03:15:32,860 --> 03:15:34,620
That makes me nervous though, because I don't know where the fuck to go.

6671
03:15:38,740 --> 03:15:40,740
It's because your chicken prom distracted everybody.

6672
03:15:41,380 --> 03:15:42,120
True, true, true.

6673
03:15:42,860 --> 03:15:43,540
My fault.

6674
03:15:43,680 --> 03:15:45,120
That's in the hard-hitting questions here.

6675
03:15:45,200 --> 03:15:45,820
Making them think.

6676
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:46,660
Yeah, they're thinking.

6677
03:15:46,720 --> 03:15:47,940
They're not actually doing.

6678
03:15:49,740 --> 03:15:50,180
Okay.

6679
03:15:50,180 --> 03:15:51,120
Checkpoint pylon.

6680
03:15:51,220 --> 03:15:51,560
Checkpoint pylon.

6681
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:52,180
Yeah.

6682
03:15:52,180 --> 03:15:54,140
Jurassic, coast, and the other coast.

6683
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:57,380
Where do I want to go?

6684
03:15:57,540 --> 03:15:57,980
Are you playing?

6685
03:15:58,160 --> 03:15:58,480
Yeah.

6686
03:15:58,780 --> 03:16:00,240
Wait, we're saying coast?

6687
03:16:00,340 --> 03:16:00,920
We're going coast?

6688
03:16:01,320 --> 03:16:04,100
Yeah, coastal and Devastated coast are both still open.

6689
03:16:04,480 --> 03:16:05,400
I mean, definitely.

6690
03:16:05,400 --> 03:16:07,380
Okay, so let's just... we're starting.

6691
03:16:07,480 --> 03:16:08,300
So let's just go pylon.

6692
03:16:08,460 --> 03:16:10,140
And if someone's there, let's go checkpoint.

6693
03:16:10,920 --> 03:16:11,360
Okay.

6694
03:16:11,400 --> 03:16:11,780
Down.

6695
03:16:11,940 --> 03:16:13,640
I mean, that's a really hard jump though.

6696
03:16:14,480 --> 03:16:18,040
We just got to hope it starts bottom right and goes top left.

6697
03:16:18,240 --> 03:16:19,180
Oh, fuck me.

6698
03:16:19,180 --> 03:16:19,960
Okay, let's try it.

6699
03:16:20,380 --> 03:16:22,040
Well, wait, am I still caustic?

6700
03:16:22,920 --> 03:16:24,100
On storm point, probably not.

6701
03:16:24,180 --> 03:16:25,180
No, Watson, I would say.

6702
03:16:25,540 --> 03:16:25,860
Okay.

6703
03:16:25,960 --> 03:16:26,240
Okay.

6704
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:28,660
Are we swapping back?

6705
03:16:28,820 --> 03:16:30,640
Like, you're on blood and I'm on bang?

6706
03:16:31,320 --> 03:16:33,000
No, I think we stay Valk, to be honest.

6707
03:16:33,200 --> 03:16:33,400
Okay.

6708
03:16:33,960 --> 03:16:35,660
I think Valk's going to be like really important for us.

6709
03:16:35,840 --> 03:16:37,320
Are you cool on blood or no?

6710
03:16:37,400 --> 03:16:38,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6711
03:16:38,140 --> 03:16:38,940
I was just wondering.

6712
03:16:39,560 --> 03:16:40,080
No, you're good.

6713
03:16:40,140 --> 03:16:41,060
I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

6714
03:16:44,940 --> 03:16:45,260
Alrighty.

6715
03:16:45,940 --> 03:16:46,960
It's 645, right?

6716
03:16:47,460 --> 03:16:47,780
Yeah.

6717
03:16:47,860 --> 03:16:48,180
Go.

6718
03:16:48,580 --> 03:16:51,820
The thing is that I think that barbecue place is like 30 minutes away.

6719
03:16:52,340 --> 03:16:52,740
Oh.

6720
03:16:53,320 --> 03:16:53,980
Let me check.

6721
03:16:54,440 --> 03:16:55,560
30 minutes away from food?

6722
03:16:55,620 --> 03:16:56,440
Wouldn't be downtown LA.

6723
03:16:57,060 --> 03:16:57,460
Yeah.

6724
03:16:57,460 --> 03:16:57,680
Jesus.

6725
03:16:57,740 --> 03:16:58,160
30 minutes.

6726
03:16:58,360 --> 03:16:59,500
What the fuck are you guys just talking about?

6727
03:17:00,380 --> 03:17:00,780
Hungry.

6728
03:17:00,800 --> 03:17:01,360
25 minutes.

6729
03:17:02,440 --> 03:17:03,400
Oh, we're talking about stuff.

6730
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:05,460
It's a long drive for food.

6731
03:17:05,580 --> 03:17:05,860
All right.

6732
03:17:06,060 --> 03:17:07,420
Bottom right, top left.

6733
03:17:07,500 --> 03:17:07,740
Ready?

6734
03:17:08,260 --> 03:17:08,800
All right.

6735
03:17:08,840 --> 03:17:09,680
The ship did not...

6736
03:17:09,680 --> 03:17:12,140
It's the exact opposite of what you just said, by the way.

6737
03:17:12,160 --> 03:17:12,880
Well, that's not bad.

6738
03:17:12,980 --> 03:17:14,780
If we see someone going left, we go right.

6739
03:17:14,980 --> 03:17:15,740
That's not bad at all.

6740
03:17:15,740 --> 03:17:16,460
That's not bad at all.

6741
03:17:17,920 --> 03:17:18,440
Let's just see.

6742
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:19,980
This is where we want to go.

6743
03:17:20,260 --> 03:17:21,820
I might just jump early, but I don't see anybody.

6744
03:17:22,520 --> 03:17:23,940
I got to turn my audio back up.

6745
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:24,900
How about you jump, by the way?

6746
03:17:24,980 --> 03:17:26,860
There's one team potentially going there for sure.

6747
03:17:28,780 --> 03:17:29,400
Should we risk it?

6748
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:30,580
I think checkpoint might be the more free one.

6749
03:17:30,580 --> 03:17:30,820
Go there?

6750
03:17:31,500 --> 03:17:31,780
Checkpoint?

6751
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:33,000
Oh, yeah.

6752
03:17:33,060 --> 03:17:33,240
There we go.

6753
03:17:33,320 --> 03:17:33,460
Checkpoint.

6754
03:17:33,540 --> 03:17:34,280
Go, go, go, go, go.

6755
03:17:34,320 --> 03:17:34,700
Go now.

6756
03:17:34,700 --> 03:17:34,880
Go now.

6757
03:17:34,880 --> 03:17:35,080
Go now.

6758
03:17:35,180 --> 03:17:35,760
Go now.

6759
03:17:35,960 --> 03:17:36,020
Go now.

6760
03:17:36,020 --> 03:17:36,100
Go now.

6761
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:36,880
Go now.

6762
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:39,600
Go now.

6763
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:40,400
I'm turning around to watch.

6764
03:17:40,780 --> 03:17:42,240
I'm looking at the team chart, right?

6765
03:17:42,300 --> 03:17:44,000
I don't think anyone is going pylon, though.

6766
03:17:44,880 --> 03:17:45,240
So, yeah.

6767
03:17:45,280 --> 03:17:45,600
We know now.

6768
03:17:45,740 --> 03:17:46,740
I think there is one team, bro.

6769
03:17:46,860 --> 03:17:47,380
I'm pretty sure.

6770
03:17:47,960 --> 03:17:49,100
There's one team here, too, maybe.

6771
03:17:49,860 --> 03:17:50,240
All right.

6772
03:17:50,260 --> 03:17:53,160
What we're going to do is you guys are going to both land on this building back here just in case we're getting contested, okay?

6773
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:54,180
I'm going to land middle.

6774
03:17:54,320 --> 03:17:54,880
I'm going to land middle.

6775
03:17:55,220 --> 03:17:57,200
There is someone right above us.

6776
03:17:57,200 --> 03:17:58,040
Someone right above us.

6777
03:17:58,260 --> 03:17:58,880
Right below us.

6778
03:17:58,880 --> 03:17:59,000
Yeah.

6779
03:17:59,140 --> 03:17:59,340
Yeah.

6780
03:17:59,400 --> 03:17:59,920
Go over here.

6781
03:18:00,140 --> 03:18:00,420
Okay.

6782
03:18:00,640 --> 03:18:01,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6783
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:01,640
No.

6784
03:18:01,700 --> 03:18:02,480
We have no choice now, sadly.

6785
03:18:02,740 --> 03:18:04,240
Oh, we are getting contested.

6786
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:05,360
We're going to make it work.

6787
03:18:05,440 --> 03:18:05,680
We're good.

6788
03:18:05,700 --> 03:18:05,860
We're good.

6789
03:18:06,480 --> 03:18:06,900
We're better.

6790
03:18:07,020 --> 03:18:07,240
We're better.

6791
03:18:07,700 --> 03:18:07,980
100%.

6792
03:18:07,980 --> 03:18:08,740
I'll just hold angle from here.

6793
03:18:09,940 --> 03:18:10,220
Okay.

6794
03:18:10,860 --> 03:18:11,660
I think we are for sure.

6795
03:18:12,060 --> 03:18:15,080
Here's a charge rifle for a fight that's in front of us.

6796
03:18:15,560 --> 03:18:15,920
We're good.

6797
03:18:16,160 --> 03:18:16,780
We can just leave.

6798
03:18:16,900 --> 03:18:17,280
We can just leave.

6799
03:18:17,320 --> 03:18:18,420
Get your loot and then go back down below.

6800
03:18:18,500 --> 03:18:18,940
We're going to go down below.

6801
03:18:18,960 --> 03:18:19,180
Okay.

6802
03:18:19,420 --> 03:18:19,700
Okay.

6803
03:18:20,620 --> 03:18:23,500
I don't want to fight this because I just don't know who's near us or what they're going to do.

6804
03:18:24,660 --> 03:18:26,280
I just don't know who it is, to be fair.

6805
03:18:26,640 --> 03:18:27,020
All right.

6806
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:28,620
I'm going to jump off and we're just going to keep going mountain ride side.

6807
03:18:28,760 --> 03:18:30,060
We're going to go walk towards middle side, okay?

6808
03:18:30,480 --> 03:18:30,900
All right.

6809
03:18:31,380 --> 03:18:31,660
Okay.

6810
03:18:31,700 --> 03:18:32,340
I'm heading over now.

6811
03:18:33,460 --> 03:18:33,740
Yeah.

6812
03:18:33,740 --> 03:18:34,460
I'm going to start walking down immediately.

6813
03:18:34,660 --> 03:18:35,780
Steer their loot and get the fuck out of here.

6814
03:18:35,780 --> 03:18:36,720
We might just... Yeah.

6815
03:18:36,780 --> 03:18:37,940
I think we go pylon next game.

6816
03:18:38,360 --> 03:18:39,040
I think so, too.

6817
03:18:39,080 --> 03:18:39,400
Let's do it.

6818
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:39,600
Yeah.

6819
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:39,780
That's fine.

6820
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:41,960
But also, teams might take it now because they might think it's free.

6821
03:18:42,900 --> 03:18:43,640
Just loot all this.

6822
03:18:43,660 --> 03:18:44,300
I'll go to the next building.

6823
03:18:44,340 --> 03:18:44,960
You guys loot this building.

6824
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:45,640
Go down below.

6825
03:18:45,800 --> 03:18:46,140
We're going to go.

6826
03:18:46,620 --> 03:18:46,980
All right.

6827
03:18:47,880 --> 03:18:48,320
We're fine.

6828
03:18:48,820 --> 03:18:49,340
We're going to be fine.

6829
03:18:50,540 --> 03:18:51,720
I picked up a scope.

6830
03:18:52,540 --> 03:18:53,000
All right.

6831
03:18:53,040 --> 03:18:54,100
And there's a charge rifle here, too.

6832
03:18:56,940 --> 03:18:58,200
Let's just see what is free here.

6833
03:18:58,260 --> 03:18:58,740
Let's just see.

6834
03:19:05,350 --> 03:19:06,630
Are they low-balling up there?

6835
03:19:07,270 --> 03:19:07,770
I'm good.

6836
03:19:08,690 --> 03:19:09,010
Nice.

6837
03:19:10,730 --> 03:19:12,310
They're fighting over in mills right now, by the way.

6838
03:19:13,170 --> 03:19:13,770
There's a skull.

6839
03:19:13,850 --> 03:19:13,910
I'm going to go up here.

6840
03:19:14,830 --> 03:19:15,070
Nice.

6841
03:19:15,750 --> 03:19:17,050
I can't use it, sadly, but it's...

6842
03:19:19,970 --> 03:19:20,450
All right.

6843
03:19:20,470 --> 03:19:21,270
I'm going to walk down here.

6844
03:19:21,410 --> 03:19:23,470
I think we just... I think we need to find a beacon.

6845
03:19:23,630 --> 03:19:25,470
We should get this Evo cache, though, on the rotation out.

6846
03:19:25,650 --> 03:19:25,810
Yep.

6847
03:19:26,170 --> 03:19:26,410
Agreed.

6848
03:19:26,490 --> 03:19:26,950
For sure.

6849
03:19:27,510 --> 03:19:28,610
We do not want to be blues anymore.

6850
03:19:28,670 --> 03:19:29,530
We do not want to be whites anymore.

6851
03:19:29,670 --> 03:19:29,910
12 is down.

6852
03:19:31,030 --> 03:19:31,270
Nice.

6853
03:19:31,310 --> 03:19:31,490
Okay.

6854
03:19:31,550 --> 03:19:32,090
So, one team dead.

6855
03:19:32,150 --> 03:19:33,230
That's going to be the mills team that just died.

6856
03:19:34,590 --> 03:19:37,190
So, we should be able to rotate and get this Evo cache over near Cito.

6857
03:19:37,510 --> 03:19:39,930
I want to destroy these spiders, but I don't know if we want to do it right now.

6858
03:19:40,910 --> 03:19:43,370
We really, really need... like...

6859
03:19:44,010 --> 03:19:45,910
Not an Evo somewhere.

6860
03:19:46,610 --> 03:19:46,890
No.

6861
03:19:46,990 --> 03:19:47,350
For sure.

6862
03:19:47,370 --> 03:19:48,250
One bat, six cells.

6863
03:19:48,310 --> 03:19:49,510
We're going to hit this Evo cache right now.

6864
03:19:49,710 --> 03:19:51,950
We got to watch out, though, Tempo, because this team...

6865
03:19:51,950 --> 03:19:52,730
There's another nade.

6866
03:19:52,890 --> 03:19:54,110
There's another team fighting in there.

6867
03:19:54,650 --> 03:19:54,930
Yeah.

6868
03:19:54,950 --> 03:19:55,090
Yeah.

6869
03:19:55,230 --> 03:19:56,130
I think we just let them fight.

6870
03:19:56,290 --> 03:19:56,570
Okay.

6871
03:19:56,830 --> 03:19:57,090
We're good.

6872
03:19:57,410 --> 03:19:58,150
Where do we want to go?

6873
03:19:58,470 --> 03:19:59,230
I don't know, bro.

6874
03:19:59,270 --> 03:20:01,190
I want to go towards Cito, but if this team's still here, I don't want to...

6875
03:20:01,190 --> 03:20:01,530
Cito's looted.

6876
03:20:01,650 --> 03:20:01,810
Yeah.

6877
03:20:02,390 --> 03:20:03,690
I know, but I don't know if they're still here.

6878
03:20:03,830 --> 03:20:04,390
You know what I mean?

6879
03:20:04,770 --> 03:20:08,190
But this would be... We're pretty early right now on the rotation, and Cito takes a long time to loot.

6880
03:20:09,410 --> 03:20:12,850
Let's play slow here and see, because the Cito station team should be really good if they're playing Cito.

6881
03:20:13,590 --> 03:20:14,370
Should be a good squad.

6882
03:20:16,050 --> 03:20:17,250
Yeah, they are on top Cito right now.

6883
03:20:17,270 --> 03:20:17,810
Yeah, yeah, they scan us.

6884
03:20:18,470 --> 03:20:19,130
We're going to back up here.

6885
03:20:19,190 --> 03:20:19,550
Back up here.

6886
03:20:19,590 --> 03:20:19,890
Back up here.

6887
03:20:19,970 --> 03:20:20,270
Back up here.

6888
03:20:20,690 --> 03:20:21,270
We're going to go back.

6889
03:20:23,010 --> 03:20:24,530
We're going to go towards Bean, okay?

6890
03:20:24,690 --> 03:20:25,930
We're just going to walk over here and go towards Bean.

6891
03:20:25,990 --> 03:20:26,570
We're going to pathkill this guy.

6892
03:20:27,470 --> 03:20:30,190
I know it's a really shit route for us, but we don't really have another play right now.

6893
03:20:30,230 --> 03:20:30,890
We're kind of getting fucked.

6894
03:20:32,930 --> 03:20:33,410
We're good, though.

6895
03:20:33,750 --> 03:20:34,150
We're fine.

6896
03:20:34,670 --> 03:20:35,850
We need another Evo.

6897
03:20:36,730 --> 03:20:37,150
I know.

6898
03:20:37,290 --> 03:20:37,630
This blows.

6899
03:20:38,350 --> 03:20:40,790
Or we can... Yeah, we don't have a scanning thing either.

6900
03:20:40,950 --> 03:20:41,650
No, we don't.

6901
03:20:41,650 --> 03:20:43,250
I'm going to shield cell right now, just in case.

6902
03:20:43,870 --> 03:20:44,290
That's fine.

6903
03:20:44,810 --> 03:20:45,370
Do your thing.

6904
03:20:45,450 --> 03:20:46,890
We're still mating back there, yeah.

6905
03:20:47,410 --> 03:20:47,970
I mean, yeah.

6906
03:20:48,030 --> 03:20:49,450
I would third party if we didn't have fucking wights.

6907
03:20:50,910 --> 03:20:51,650
We just loot this up.

6908
03:20:51,690 --> 03:20:51,850
We're good.

6909
03:20:52,970 --> 03:20:53,690
We love this.

6910
03:20:53,750 --> 03:20:54,330
Take our time.

6911
03:20:54,550 --> 03:20:57,310
And we just have to literally just loot up to make sure we just C-zone.

6912
03:20:57,410 --> 03:20:59,090
You can also hit that prowler if anyone wants the damage for the Evo.

6913
03:20:59,370 --> 03:21:00,390
Do you get enough Evo anymore?

6914
03:21:00,510 --> 03:21:00,810
I don't remember.

6915
03:21:00,970 --> 03:21:01,630
I think you do, right?

6916
03:21:06,110 --> 03:21:07,790
We really just need...

6917
03:21:09,170 --> 03:21:10,870
We need like a hundred...

6918
03:21:10,870 --> 03:21:11,350
Guys, did you hear?

6919
03:21:11,350 --> 03:21:12,650
Only 15 squads already, guys.

6920
03:21:12,710 --> 03:21:14,330
So many teams are early fighting for no fucking reason.

6921
03:21:14,390 --> 03:21:14,730
This is great.

6922
03:21:15,550 --> 03:21:16,690
No one wants to take those.

6923
03:21:17,910 --> 03:21:18,790
There's a 2x on that.

6924
03:21:19,210 --> 03:21:20,210
I have a 3x ready.

6925
03:21:20,270 --> 03:21:20,570
I'm good.

6926
03:21:21,210 --> 03:21:21,770
I'm good too.

6927
03:21:22,130 --> 03:21:23,830
Let's just keep looting up.

6928
03:21:24,110 --> 03:21:26,310
Yeah, because teams are landing on each other, so...

6929
03:21:26,310 --> 03:21:27,010
Yeah, exactly.

6930
03:21:27,290 --> 03:21:27,870
So we should be good here.

6931
03:21:27,870 --> 03:21:28,390
Because they're not sure.

6932
03:21:29,110 --> 03:21:29,390
Yeah.

6933
03:21:29,710 --> 03:21:31,710
There's going to be a lot of teams fighting that don't know where the fuck to go to.

6934
03:21:31,950 --> 03:21:35,730
Don't forget, we saw like three POIs free and we got landed on, so that sucks ass, but that's what it is.

6935
03:21:36,510 --> 03:21:37,910
We can go get the care pack here too, maybe.

6936
03:21:38,070 --> 03:21:39,230
People were here 10 seconds ago.

6937
03:21:39,910 --> 03:21:40,370
Okay, nice.

6938
03:21:40,390 --> 03:21:40,950
They got the care pack.

6939
03:21:40,990 --> 03:21:41,250
You're good.

6940
03:21:41,350 --> 03:21:42,090
They're over here now too.

6941
03:21:42,510 --> 03:21:45,290
They're rotating back towards CETA, but did the barometer have a beacon?

6942
03:21:45,350 --> 03:21:45,490
No.

6943
03:21:45,490 --> 03:21:46,170
It didn't have a beacon either.

6944
03:21:46,230 --> 03:21:48,110
So these guys, no one near us really had a beacon at all.

6945
03:21:48,370 --> 03:21:49,490
We just wait for the zone to close.

6946
03:21:49,570 --> 03:21:50,810
I think we played big building over here near us.

6947
03:21:51,050 --> 03:21:52,550
And we just wait for the zone to close and go from there.

6948
03:21:52,770 --> 03:21:53,050
Okay.

6949
03:21:53,230 --> 03:21:53,510
Let's play in here.

6950
03:21:54,810 --> 03:21:56,450
Put together, fence up, and then we just go.

6951
03:21:56,550 --> 03:21:58,270
It's definitely not going to end near here, but it's fine.

6952
03:22:01,240 --> 03:22:03,020
Just stick together and show presence and we're good to go.

6953
03:22:03,340 --> 03:22:06,480
We're going to play this late, but we have a Valk for this exact reason, to be honest.

6954
03:22:06,840 --> 03:22:08,580
Is there any other Evos that we can get?

6955
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:09,540
Any other Evo caches?

6956
03:22:09,660 --> 03:22:11,580
There's no one near... no, none of them are near us.

6957
03:22:12,220 --> 03:22:12,980
So ass, bro.

6958
03:22:13,020 --> 03:22:15,840
The team that fucked this checkpoint sucks because we could have got an Evo cache up there too.

6959
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:16,400
It's all good.

6960
03:22:18,360 --> 03:22:18,680
I'm going to go.

6961
03:22:18,680 --> 03:22:19,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6962
03:22:19,580 --> 03:22:19,900
Scary.

6963
03:22:20,800 --> 03:22:22,760
I'm... well, I'm 12-3, so...

6964
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:23,260
Okay.

6965
03:22:23,360 --> 03:22:24,400
Yeah, I'm 0-6.

6966
03:22:24,420 --> 03:22:24,860
0-16.

6967
03:22:25,060 --> 03:22:25,840
I have no bats.

6968
03:22:25,860 --> 03:22:26,440
I have cells, though.

6969
03:22:26,760 --> 03:22:27,080
Alright.

6970
03:22:28,600 --> 03:22:29,160
We're good, baby.

6971
03:22:29,280 --> 03:22:30,120
We're vibing the fuck out.

6972
03:22:30,520 --> 03:22:31,260
Just stay calm.

6973
03:22:31,540 --> 03:22:32,220
We got this.

6974
03:22:32,220 --> 03:22:33,100
Valk ulti's pretty...

6975
03:22:33,100 --> 03:22:33,540
I'm still calm.

6976
03:22:33,540 --> 03:22:35,020
Valk ulti's literally going to be our saving grace.

6977
03:22:35,120 --> 03:22:35,580
Like, the biggest.

6978
03:22:35,700 --> 03:22:36,720
I have an evac tower too.

6979
03:22:36,920 --> 03:22:38,000
I want to jump this guy here.

6980
03:22:38,220 --> 03:22:38,840
I have a West Beacon.

6981
03:22:40,440 --> 03:22:41,320
Someone take that back.

6982
03:22:41,440 --> 03:22:41,800
I got it.

6983
03:22:42,760 --> 03:22:43,340
Oh, Ana's on her.

6984
03:22:43,340 --> 03:22:43,580
Oh, Ana's on her.

6985
03:22:44,700 --> 03:22:45,600
We're going to run right on her too.

6986
03:22:45,640 --> 03:22:46,160
They're going to fight this point.

6987
03:22:46,260 --> 03:22:46,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6988
03:22:46,860 --> 03:22:47,440
I'm going, going, going.

6989
03:22:47,560 --> 03:22:48,080
You're ready for a fight.

6990
03:22:48,080 --> 03:22:48,640
You're ready for a fight here.

6991
03:22:49,260 --> 03:22:49,800
So we're at 33.

6992
03:22:50,620 --> 03:22:51,400
Keep scanning when you can.

6993
03:22:51,460 --> 03:22:52,400
We're going to have to get opening damage here.

6994
03:22:52,420 --> 03:22:52,760
I already scanned once.

6995
03:22:53,280 --> 03:22:53,700
Yeah, you're good.

6996
03:22:53,940 --> 03:22:54,640
I might be down.

6997
03:22:55,120 --> 03:22:55,680
In from the window.

6998
03:22:55,740 --> 03:22:56,080
In from the window.

6999
03:22:56,220 --> 03:22:56,380
Yeah.

7000
03:22:56,620 --> 03:22:56,860
Yep.

7001
03:22:57,300 --> 03:22:57,940
I have to heal.

7002
03:22:57,960 --> 03:22:58,280
I have to heal.

7003
03:22:58,280 --> 03:22:58,620
I have to heal.

7004
03:22:58,720 --> 03:22:59,100
You're good.

7005
03:22:59,120 --> 03:22:59,200
You're good.

7006
03:22:59,280 --> 03:22:59,280
You're good.

7007
03:22:59,900 --> 03:23:00,460
I'm in now too.

7008
03:23:00,860 --> 03:23:01,380
Shots up top.

7009
03:23:01,620 --> 03:23:02,080
Oh, I'm in.

7010
03:23:02,200 --> 03:23:02,480
No audio?

7011
03:23:02,600 --> 03:23:03,160
Super sick.

7012
03:23:03,340 --> 03:23:03,840
Oh, no.

7013
03:23:03,940 --> 03:23:05,740
If one of you guys can, if one of you guys can leave, you should.

7014
03:23:05,880 --> 03:23:06,120
You have to leave.

7015
03:23:06,120 --> 03:23:06,120
You have to leave.

7016
03:23:06,120 --> 03:23:06,620
Drop me.

7017
03:23:06,780 --> 03:23:07,060
Drop me.

7018
03:23:07,380 --> 03:23:07,760
Drop me.

7019
03:23:07,760 --> 03:23:07,760
Drop me.

7020
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:08,200
You leave.

7021
03:23:08,320 --> 03:23:08,580
You leave.

7022
03:23:08,680 --> 03:23:09,420
They're really out my door.

7023
03:23:09,420 --> 03:23:10,060
Armors, armors.

7024
03:23:10,060 --> 03:23:10,480
Run away.

7025
03:23:10,540 --> 03:23:11,060
Run away to armory.

7026
03:23:11,060 --> 03:23:11,340
Yeah, yeah.

7027
03:23:11,340 --> 03:23:11,640
Just run.

7028
03:23:11,740 --> 03:23:11,920
Just run.

7029
03:23:12,620 --> 03:23:14,240
God, we're getting fucking old.

7030
03:23:14,240 --> 03:23:14,460
Nope.

7031
03:23:14,460 --> 03:23:15,420
They just fucking scanned me.

7032
03:23:15,440 --> 03:23:15,860
That's them again.

7033
03:23:16,300 --> 03:23:16,960
Is that them again?

7034
03:23:17,340 --> 03:23:18,100
I have no idea.

7035
03:23:18,120 --> 03:23:18,660
Just keep running tempo.

7036
03:23:18,700 --> 03:23:19,880
They're going to just land on you.

7037
03:23:21,100 --> 03:23:21,720
Just keep going.

7038
03:23:24,560 --> 03:23:24,920
Whoa.

7039
03:23:25,260 --> 03:23:25,700
That's awesome.

7040
03:23:25,740 --> 03:23:27,680
Bro, if it's them again, I'm actually just going to be so mad.

7041
03:23:27,740 --> 03:23:28,120
It's unbelievable.

7042
03:23:28,380 --> 03:23:29,900
I have... were they rank 41?

7043
03:23:30,660 --> 03:23:31,560
I have no idea.

7044
03:23:32,980 --> 03:23:33,620
Oh, we're getting fucking old.

7045
03:23:33,620 --> 03:23:34,540
Is that them again?

7046
03:23:35,420 --> 03:23:36,000
Is it?

7047
03:23:36,060 --> 03:23:36,820
Their horizon.

7048
03:23:38,300 --> 03:23:38,660
It's them again.

7049
03:23:38,660 --> 03:23:39,100
Oh, my god.

7050
03:23:39,100 --> 03:23:39,340
Oh, my god.

7051
03:23:39,420 --> 03:23:40,740
It is them.

7052
03:23:40,900 --> 03:23:42,340
They're right behind us.

7053
03:23:43,680 --> 03:23:45,000
These kids are so cringe, bro.

7054
03:23:45,760 --> 03:23:47,140
How did they get us again?

7055
03:23:48,100 --> 03:23:52,480
It must have been the mill... wait, is this their first... it's their first fight.

7056
03:23:52,500 --> 03:23:53,280
Yeah, it's their first fight.

7057
03:23:53,280 --> 03:23:53,320
So they weren't mill.

7058
03:23:53,340 --> 03:23:54,940
They were probably C note, I guess.

7059
03:23:58,470 --> 03:23:58,830
Right?

7060
03:23:58,870 --> 03:23:59,610
I'm trying, bro.

7061
03:23:59,690 --> 03:24:00,410
And look at the zone, too.

7062
03:24:00,450 --> 03:24:00,790
Checkpoint.

7063
03:24:02,590 --> 03:24:03,310
Oh, my god.

7064
03:24:03,530 --> 03:24:03,870
Oh.

7065
03:24:04,430 --> 03:24:06,250
Maybe we should have just fought the checkpoint team.

7066
03:24:06,490 --> 03:24:07,370
I don't know, bro.

7067
03:24:07,450 --> 03:24:08,750
And that situation is just so tough.

7068
03:24:08,870 --> 03:24:09,150
Yeah.

7069
03:24:09,290 --> 03:24:09,650
Like...

7070
03:24:11,570 --> 03:24:12,590
God damn it.

7071
03:24:12,590 --> 03:24:13,470
We can't make it.

7072
03:24:13,470 --> 03:24:14,090
It's them again.

7073
03:24:14,330 --> 03:24:15,390
We died to them again.

7074
03:24:16,230 --> 03:24:18,190
Yeah, it's actually just super unfortunate.

7075
03:24:18,950 --> 03:24:20,050
Are they fighting again?

7076
03:24:22,490 --> 03:24:23,190
Oh, no, dude.

7077
03:24:23,230 --> 03:24:27,030
I hope you guys get... I hope you guys get day two, you motherfuckers.

7078
03:24:27,630 --> 03:24:28,010
What?

7079
03:24:28,070 --> 03:24:28,470
That's right.

7080
03:24:28,590 --> 03:24:29,850
We still have one more game.

7081
03:24:29,910 --> 03:24:30,510
We still have one more game.

7082
03:24:30,610 --> 03:24:31,050
It's all good.

7083
03:24:31,090 --> 03:24:31,650
Don't forget.

7084
03:24:31,930 --> 03:24:33,350
One game, but we can still get us through.

7085
03:24:33,430 --> 03:24:35,730
Yeah, we just need one game.

7086
03:24:35,770 --> 03:24:36,870
We got one point.

7087
03:24:38,310 --> 03:24:38,690
Guys.

7088
03:24:41,070 --> 03:24:42,830
We got that one point, guys.

7089
03:24:43,090 --> 03:24:48,810
I mean, to be honest, as long as this team keeps rolling every other team and the teams with us don't get any points, we should still be fine.

7090
03:24:49,110 --> 03:24:49,670
100%, bro.

7091
03:24:49,790 --> 03:24:50,310
Without a doubt.

7092
03:24:50,850 --> 03:24:53,950
Yeah, but our third... our last game has to be good.

7093
03:24:54,070 --> 03:24:54,490
We need to get...

7094
03:24:54,490 --> 03:24:55,830
Yeah, our last game has to be decent here.

7095
03:24:55,890 --> 03:24:57,350
We need to find a spot.

7096
03:24:57,990 --> 03:24:59,650
We need to find a spot to land to.

7097
03:25:00,410 --> 03:25:01,710
I think pylon should be fine.

7098
03:25:02,430 --> 03:25:02,790
Pylon?

7099
03:25:03,070 --> 03:25:03,370
Okay.

7100
03:25:03,610 --> 03:25:03,910
Yeah.

7101
03:25:04,750 --> 03:25:05,650
It was open.

7102
03:25:05,690 --> 03:25:10,050
Like, it was open, but we only... we veered away because we thought someone was going to be there.

7103
03:25:11,390 --> 03:25:12,730
Well, we should have went on pylon.

7104
03:25:13,390 --> 03:25:15,590
Where is this team landing?

7105
03:25:16,830 --> 03:25:17,970
The team that just killed us?

7106
03:25:18,050 --> 03:25:18,270
Yeah.

7107
03:25:18,970 --> 03:25:20,370
Probably C note.

7108
03:25:20,570 --> 03:25:21,250
I would say C note.

7109
03:25:21,430 --> 03:25:25,350
Because we knew... someone was fighting mill and they don't have any kills from before us.

7110
03:25:26,130 --> 03:25:28,610
So it's either C note or barometer that they went.

7111
03:25:30,510 --> 03:25:34,010
Yeah, because they're like mirroring us in both maps.

7112
03:25:41,130 --> 03:25:41,730
It's okay.

7113
03:25:41,810 --> 03:25:42,610
We don't make it through.

7114
03:25:42,650 --> 03:25:43,930
We still have next week, guys.

7115
03:25:46,510 --> 03:25:48,390
We still have next week, guys.

7116
03:25:48,830 --> 03:25:50,030
No, we got this, guys.

7117
03:25:50,070 --> 03:25:50,510
We got this.

7118
03:25:51,090 --> 03:25:52,650
Wait, is it literally next week?

7119
03:25:52,730 --> 03:25:53,490
Like the Saturday?

7120
03:25:53,530 --> 03:25:54,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7121
03:25:54,030 --> 03:25:54,850
It's actually next week.

7122
03:25:55,090 --> 03:25:56,150
I'm going to send you all something.

7123
03:25:56,350 --> 03:25:57,990
Don't look at it though on...

7124
03:25:58,510 --> 03:25:59,070
Oh, okay.

7125
03:26:02,090 --> 03:26:03,250
Okay, I'm going to be honest.

7126
03:26:07,710 --> 03:26:08,750
That's the only thing I'll read.

7127
03:26:08,750 --> 03:26:09,030
That's...

7128
03:26:13,930 --> 03:26:14,590
Don't look at it.

7129
03:26:14,610 --> 03:26:15,670
Okay, I'm going to be honest.

7130
03:26:22,570 --> 03:26:24,230
I thought I did.

7131
03:26:25,610 --> 03:26:28,690
Because I know the first sentence you write is not going to be anything.

7132
03:26:29,110 --> 03:26:30,370
Yeah, no, of course, of course, of course.

7133
03:26:31,410 --> 03:26:36,230
It definitely wasn't her just reading out, not thinking, and being like, oh, wait a minute.

7134
03:26:37,370 --> 03:26:38,190
Yeah, I understand.

7135
03:26:38,790 --> 03:26:39,190
Yeah.

7136
03:26:42,590 --> 03:26:43,510
That's right, guys.

7137
03:26:43,630 --> 03:26:44,070
That's right, dude.

7138
03:26:44,850 --> 03:26:47,910
All right, we can get 10 points in this next game.

7139
03:26:48,070 --> 03:26:49,150
And then we Gucci.

7140
03:26:50,050 --> 03:26:52,110
But if this team...

7141
03:26:52,110 --> 03:26:53,190
One good game is all that matters, bro.

7142
03:26:53,250 --> 03:26:53,970
One good game.

7143
03:26:54,130 --> 03:27:04,710
If this team or the other two teams, if this one or Redeem or Relax just kill everyone anyway, then we actually stay in our ranking anyway.

7144
03:27:04,850 --> 03:27:05,390
So we're good.

7145
03:27:07,610 --> 03:27:08,090
Yeah.

7146
03:27:08,090 --> 03:27:11,390
We just now that they killed us, we need them to kill everyone else.

7147
03:27:11,590 --> 03:27:11,990
Okay.

7148
03:27:12,950 --> 03:27:14,970
I mean, they are sort of killing everybody.

7149
03:27:15,550 --> 03:27:15,950
Yeah.

7150
03:27:16,190 --> 03:27:19,030
But then, like, the thing is they're not killing people fast enough.

7151
03:27:19,170 --> 03:27:19,710
So, like...

7152
03:27:19,710 --> 03:27:20,470
They have 10 kills.

7153
03:27:20,830 --> 03:27:25,990
So, like, the people teams below us might just overlap us from sheer placements.

7154
03:27:26,610 --> 03:27:27,010
Maybe.

7155
03:27:27,150 --> 03:27:28,450
Yeah, we're getting zero points.

7156
03:27:28,530 --> 03:27:29,830
We got one.

7157
03:27:30,650 --> 03:27:31,350
Oh, we got one?

7158
03:27:31,410 --> 03:27:32,130
Oh, we got one.

7159
03:27:32,310 --> 03:27:32,770
Okay, good.

7160
03:27:32,950 --> 03:27:34,530
We died, like, 15.

7161
03:27:35,370 --> 03:27:38,070
I mean, if we can actually get pylon for free, though, we're going to be fine.

7162
03:27:38,070 --> 03:27:39,250
Yeah, I think we'll be fine.

7163
03:27:39,350 --> 03:27:39,510
Yeah.

7164
03:27:39,630 --> 03:27:40,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7165
03:27:40,390 --> 03:27:41,530
If we get pylon for free...

7166
03:27:41,530 --> 03:27:43,270
This is the checkpoint team that...

7167
03:27:44,210 --> 03:27:46,550
This has got to be the checkpoint team that we landed with.

7168
03:27:47,090 --> 03:27:49,350
It's really unfortunate, bro, that that checkpoint team...

7169
03:27:49,350 --> 03:27:49,710
That it pulled up here?

7170
03:27:50,110 --> 03:27:50,410
Yeah.

7171
03:27:50,570 --> 03:27:52,850
I mean, to be honest, we also didn't say checkpoint.

7172
03:27:53,470 --> 03:27:54,350
Yeah, that's true.

7173
03:27:54,770 --> 03:27:55,750
To be fair, you're right.

7174
03:27:55,870 --> 03:27:56,230
Yeah.

7175
03:27:57,190 --> 03:27:57,970
Did they claim checkpoint?

7176
03:27:57,970 --> 03:28:00,030
We should just type 2POI so that everyone gets confused.

7177
03:28:00,290 --> 03:28:02,110
No one typed checkpoint.

7178
03:28:02,170 --> 03:28:02,410
Yeah.

7179
03:28:02,550 --> 03:28:04,370
Oh, no one typed checkpoint.

7180
03:28:04,590 --> 03:28:04,810
Oh.

7181
03:28:04,950 --> 03:28:07,070
So that's why we thought we should be okay there, too.

7182
03:28:07,070 --> 03:28:08,950
If it looked like someone was going pylon.

7183
03:28:09,630 --> 03:28:09,990
Yeah.

7184
03:28:11,150 --> 03:28:12,990
So technically, it's also their fault, too.

7185
03:28:13,590 --> 03:28:14,450
It's also our fault.

7186
03:28:14,790 --> 03:28:16,410
They should be mad at us, to be honest.

7187
03:28:16,450 --> 03:28:17,470
Yeah, they'll be like, what the fuck?

7188
03:28:17,510 --> 03:28:18,110
You typed pylon.

7189
03:28:18,270 --> 03:28:18,830
Why are you here?

7190
03:28:21,390 --> 03:28:23,930
Because no one typed checkpoint and we thought someone was going pylon.

7191
03:28:24,650 --> 03:28:25,570
Yeah, we hesitated.

7192
03:28:25,710 --> 03:28:26,490
Wait, that was team 8.

7193
03:28:26,670 --> 03:28:27,590
Who was team 8?

7194
03:28:27,770 --> 03:28:28,510
It was team 8.

7195
03:28:28,550 --> 03:28:28,850
I don't know the thing.

7196
03:28:29,830 --> 03:28:30,690
I actually don't know.

7197
03:28:42,180 --> 03:28:42,860
One sec.

7198
03:28:42,980 --> 03:28:45,180
Oh my god, I got hit by four headshots.

7199
03:28:46,400 --> 03:28:47,120
Yeah, did you?

7200
03:28:47,200 --> 03:28:47,400
Yeah.

7201
03:28:47,620 --> 03:28:48,560
Did you get fucking rocked?

7202
03:28:48,560 --> 03:28:49,340
Bro, I got no audio.

7203
03:28:49,440 --> 03:28:50,180
Did you watch my VOD back?

7204
03:28:50,300 --> 03:28:50,660
No.

7205
03:28:51,900 --> 03:28:55,840
If you watched my VOD back, I had zero audio on Horizon just landing right in front of me.

7206
03:28:55,840 --> 03:28:56,280
It was crazy.

7207
03:28:56,580 --> 03:28:58,100
I got jump scared so hard.

7208
03:28:58,320 --> 03:28:59,440
It was fucking terrifying.

7209
03:29:03,300 --> 03:29:03,880
That's okay.

7210
03:29:04,040 --> 03:29:05,280
We have one last game.

7211
03:29:05,820 --> 03:29:06,700
That's all it is, guys.

7212
03:29:06,740 --> 03:29:07,260
We got one more.

7213
03:29:07,260 --> 03:29:07,460
Listen.

7214
03:29:07,660 --> 03:29:07,820
One more game.

7215
03:29:08,140 --> 03:29:09,820
We already did better than what we thought.

7216
03:29:09,960 --> 03:29:12,940
And then next week, if we play again, we're only going to get better because we're practicing.

7217
03:29:12,940 --> 03:29:13,060
Oh, yeah.

7218
03:29:13,060 --> 03:29:13,580
Because we know.

7219
03:29:13,620 --> 03:29:14,620
Because this was our...

7220
03:29:14,620 --> 03:29:15,800
This is our practice.

7221
03:29:15,800 --> 03:29:16,520
Practice week.

7222
03:29:16,700 --> 03:29:17,060
Yeah.

7223
03:29:17,180 --> 03:29:18,920
And now we know what POIs we like.

7224
03:29:18,960 --> 03:29:20,200
We know what characters we like.

7225
03:29:20,420 --> 03:29:22,520
We're so good to go now this next week.

7226
03:29:22,520 --> 03:29:26,380
We should have done a scrim or two before this game.

7227
03:29:26,440 --> 03:29:27,040
But no.

7228
03:29:27,180 --> 03:29:28,780
Instead, this was our practice.

7229
03:29:29,240 --> 03:29:29,600
Yeah.

7230
03:29:29,980 --> 03:29:30,000
First character.

7231
03:29:30,340 --> 03:29:30,960
First character.

7232
03:29:32,320 --> 03:29:33,180
No need for that.

7233
03:29:33,380 --> 03:29:33,700
Yeah.

7234
03:29:33,720 --> 03:29:35,180
This was our practice.

7235
03:29:35,380 --> 03:29:37,060
Our practice for pro.

7236
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:37,900
Yeah.

7237
03:29:37,960 --> 03:29:39,700
It's only the one practice week, guys.

7238
03:29:39,760 --> 03:29:40,940
We got one more of these bad boys.

7239
03:29:41,020 --> 03:29:41,500
Come on, dude.

7240
03:29:41,580 --> 03:29:41,940
Yeah.

7241
03:29:42,140 --> 03:29:42,140
Yeah.

7242
03:29:42,160 --> 03:29:42,780
I'll take...

7243
03:29:42,780 --> 03:29:43,120
No, it's not good.

7244
03:29:43,120 --> 03:29:43,420
It's not good.

7245
03:29:43,820 --> 03:29:44,180
Yeah.

7246
03:29:44,180 --> 03:29:44,180
I don't know why.

7247
03:29:44,180 --> 03:29:46,780
We can't make it to the finals if we just keep spamming it.

7248
03:29:47,160 --> 03:29:50,660
We also did that so we can like, you know, have off on Sunday.

7249
03:29:50,740 --> 03:29:52,280
Like we just care about our mental health a little bit.

7250
03:29:52,360 --> 03:29:52,720
You know what I'm saying?

7251
03:29:53,080 --> 03:29:53,120
Yeah.

7252
03:29:53,120 --> 03:29:53,340
Yeah.

7253
03:29:53,440 --> 03:29:53,560
Yeah.

7254
03:29:54,040 --> 03:29:54,980
We're not done yet though.

7255
03:29:55,040 --> 03:29:55,860
I don't know why we're coping.

7256
03:29:56,120 --> 03:29:56,860
Oh, don't worry.

7257
03:29:56,960 --> 03:30:00,320
I already had... I was already planning on Sunday to be my rest day.

7258
03:30:02,580 --> 03:30:04,360
I fucking love this team so much.

7259
03:30:06,300 --> 03:30:07,420
That is fucking hilarious.

7260
03:30:13,460 --> 03:30:14,180
Oh my god.

7261
03:30:14,540 --> 03:30:16,080
Leaking TSM strats right now?

7262
03:30:16,080 --> 03:30:17,560
Oh my god, please bro.

7263
03:30:18,020 --> 03:30:21,080
That would be a juicy reddit post I could react to for content.

7264
03:30:28,200 --> 03:30:31,620
Guys, they're saying that TSM is planning on...

7265
03:30:32,440 --> 03:30:33,700
Oh, here we go.

7266
03:30:33,860 --> 03:30:35,980
They're planning on cutting Hal from TSM.

7267
03:30:36,360 --> 03:30:37,420
And then...

7268
03:30:37,420 --> 03:30:37,680
Yeah?

7269
03:30:37,860 --> 03:30:38,780
I'm getting Doki?

7270
03:30:39,280 --> 03:30:40,160
Yeah, yeah.

7271
03:30:40,600 --> 03:30:42,660
Yeah, yeah.

7272
03:30:43,140 --> 03:30:43,880
Cutting Hal.

7273
03:30:43,880 --> 03:30:46,080
And they want to bring an up and comer.

7274
03:30:46,260 --> 03:30:47,900
I hate Doki Bird.

7275
03:30:48,020 --> 03:30:49,120
I didn't do it.

7276
03:30:52,440 --> 03:30:53,860
Hal is planning on retiring.

7277
03:30:54,220 --> 03:30:54,460
No, no.

7278
03:30:54,500 --> 03:30:56,240
Hal is planning on retiring?

7279
03:30:56,620 --> 03:30:57,100
What?

7280
03:30:58,940 --> 03:30:59,460
Wow.

7281
03:30:59,500 --> 03:31:00,160
Oh my god.

7282
03:31:00,240 --> 03:31:02,260
Can we get a reddit post with Doki's name in the title?

7283
03:31:02,380 --> 03:31:02,440
Oh my god.

7284
03:31:03,340 --> 03:31:06,780
Exclusive on Doki Bird's channel?

7285
03:31:07,100 --> 03:31:10,560
I'm listening to what they're talking about on TenpoStream right now.

7286
03:31:11,040 --> 03:31:13,860
And it seems like Hal is planning on retiring.

7287
03:31:13,880 --> 03:31:20,280
And they're planning on hosting tryouts for his replacement.

7288
03:31:20,360 --> 03:31:21,860
Like this week.

7289
03:31:22,140 --> 03:31:24,000
And Rept is going full time?

7290
03:31:24,060 --> 03:31:24,800
Plans for zombies?

7291
03:31:25,020 --> 03:31:25,640
That's crazy.

7292
03:31:25,640 --> 03:31:26,400
Oh my god.

7293
03:31:26,620 --> 03:31:31,880
And like, Verhulst is planning on becoming the new IGL for TSM.

7294
03:31:33,280 --> 03:31:33,880
Insane.

7295
03:31:34,220 --> 03:31:37,000
I heard Hal is committing to ant farms full time.

7296
03:31:38,760 --> 03:31:42,340
He's committing to being a housewife for his girl.

7297
03:31:42,680 --> 03:31:43,280
He's committing to being a housewife for his girl.

7298
03:31:43,280 --> 03:31:43,860
He's committing to being a housewife for his girl.

7299
03:31:43,860 --> 03:31:44,460
Good for him.

7300
03:31:45,340 --> 03:31:46,180
Yeah, good for him.

7301
03:31:46,620 --> 03:31:47,200
Actually, yeah.

7302
03:31:47,220 --> 03:31:47,700
Good for him.

7303
03:31:48,980 --> 03:31:50,340
He's gonna be the...

7304
03:31:50,340 --> 03:31:54,540
He's gonna full on housewife duties.

7305
03:31:54,920 --> 03:31:56,060
Good for this guy, man.

7306
03:31:57,660 --> 03:31:58,360
Honestly, vibes.

7307
03:31:58,760 --> 03:31:59,360
If I'm being honest.

7308
03:31:59,580 --> 03:32:00,340
Yeah, he's like...

7309
03:32:01,820 --> 03:32:04,360
Apex is just a great time to retire.

7310
03:32:04,540 --> 03:32:05,680
This is the best time.

7311
03:32:06,180 --> 03:32:07,600
He's retiring at his peak.

7312
03:32:08,440 --> 03:32:09,420
Retiring for $5 million.

7313
03:32:10,620 --> 03:32:11,900
Yeah, good for him.

7314
03:32:11,940 --> 03:32:12,560
Good for that guy.

7315
03:32:12,700 --> 03:32:13,380
Good for that dude.

7316
03:32:16,840 --> 03:32:17,680
Oh man.

7317
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:19,160
Wow, wow, wowie.

7318
03:32:20,240 --> 03:32:20,820
You know?

7319
03:32:21,200 --> 03:32:23,480
Wowie is right, dude.

7320
03:32:26,760 --> 03:32:27,440
Don't worry.

7321
03:32:27,560 --> 03:32:28,180
We have...

7322
03:32:28,680 --> 03:32:29,560
One more game.

7323
03:32:30,180 --> 03:32:33,940
Honestly, it's gonna be 100% possible to qualify for us.

7324
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:35,440
We just need placements.

7325
03:32:35,560 --> 03:32:36,480
We need better placements.

7326
03:32:36,760 --> 03:32:40,220
We just need fucking a beacon, bro.

7327
03:32:40,380 --> 03:32:41,100
That's all we need.

7328
03:32:42,820 --> 03:32:43,700
Not running.

7329
03:32:43,860 --> 03:32:44,940
We need to fucking 8th team.

7330
03:32:45,880 --> 03:32:46,900
8th team 6.

7331
03:32:48,600 --> 03:32:50,500
What were you guys talking about?

7332
03:32:50,740 --> 03:32:51,960
What were the TSM leaks?

7333
03:32:53,040 --> 03:32:53,520
Oh.

7334
03:32:53,660 --> 03:32:54,560
We were going to dinner.

7335
03:32:54,820 --> 03:32:55,460
Oh yeah?

7336
03:32:55,640 --> 03:32:58,520
And I heard that you guys are hiring Doki as full time...

7337
03:32:58,520 --> 03:32:59,220
Yeah, yeah.

7338
03:32:59,260 --> 03:33:00,220
You're signing me up.

7339
03:33:00,440 --> 03:33:03,580
Yeah, they definitely have enough money for this.

7340
03:33:03,960 --> 03:33:06,640
After not paying for a house anymore.

7341
03:33:06,880 --> 03:33:09,940
Bro, why is this guy fucking 1v3'ing by himself?

7342
03:33:10,940 --> 03:33:12,300
Is this still the same team?

7343
03:33:12,300 --> 03:33:12,620
Yes!

7344
03:33:12,940 --> 03:33:16,260
He's like 1v3'ing away from his team.

7345
03:33:19,860 --> 03:33:21,120
They have 21 kills.

7346
03:33:21,700 --> 03:33:22,500
No, for sure.

7347
03:33:22,580 --> 03:33:25,060
Yeah, all this bro just to go out literally never make pro league.

7348
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:26,460
Yeah, to go out in day 2.

7349
03:33:27,460 --> 03:33:29,180
Cause you just can't do this against good players.

7350
03:33:29,300 --> 03:33:29,600
It's nuts.

7351
03:33:29,880 --> 03:33:31,420
I mean, we're not saying we're not good players.

7352
03:33:32,340 --> 03:33:33,920
I mean, they can do it to us though.

7353
03:33:34,540 --> 03:33:36,580
Yeah, they could definitely do it to us.

7354
03:33:36,580 --> 03:33:37,220
Probably every time.

7355
03:33:37,880 --> 03:33:40,440
They could probably beat us 3v3 99% of the time.

7356
03:33:40,440 --> 03:33:44,220
I mean, I'm pretty sure they could beat us 2v3 if they wanted.

7357
03:33:45,520 --> 03:33:46,680
Maybe even 1.

7358
03:33:46,820 --> 03:33:48,000
Maybe even 1, you know.

7359
03:33:48,120 --> 03:33:49,480
I don't wanna be surprised.

7360
03:33:50,740 --> 03:33:53,480
There's just one guy that's literally trying to 1v3 by himself.

7361
03:33:53,800 --> 03:33:57,080
They're both like all three of them are trying to 1v3 a fucking team.

7362
03:33:58,720 --> 03:34:03,580
Listen, this is all just setting up a crazy comeback story if we don't make it this week to go next week and ball the fuck out.

7363
03:34:04,280 --> 03:34:05,560
Oh, that's so true.

7364
03:34:05,880 --> 03:34:06,960
It's so true, dude.

7365
03:34:08,500 --> 03:34:08,940
Ooh.

7366
03:34:13,470 --> 03:34:15,150
It's so true, I believe it.

7367
03:34:16,190 --> 03:34:17,090
I really did too.

7368
03:34:17,210 --> 03:34:18,250
But I think we're gonna make this next one.

7369
03:34:18,330 --> 03:34:18,810
We're gonna be good to go.

7370
03:34:19,350 --> 03:34:20,430
That's the vibe I'm on right now.

7371
03:34:22,310 --> 03:34:24,170
I think we secure a W this next game.

7372
03:34:24,330 --> 03:34:25,210
This is gonna be the one we win.

7373
03:34:27,070 --> 03:34:30,610
Oh my god, and then we can... Do I get a Liquipedia now?

7374
03:34:30,610 --> 03:34:32,090
Now that I'm in CC?

7375
03:34:33,450 --> 03:34:34,730
Wait, I think I get a Liquipedia too.

7376
03:34:34,730 --> 03:34:35,910
Can I be on a Liquipedia?

7377
03:34:37,070 --> 03:34:38,390
Oh my god, are you gonna get one?

7378
03:34:38,870 --> 03:34:40,650
Oh my god, I'm in an official tournament!

7379
03:34:41,170 --> 03:34:41,610
What?

7380
03:34:41,670 --> 03:34:42,410
Zero earnings?

7381
03:34:43,250 --> 03:34:44,270
No, no, no, no.

7382
03:34:44,370 --> 03:34:47,030
If they add my content creator tournament earnings...

7383
03:34:47,030 --> 03:34:52,610
I bet you if they add all my content creator tournament earnings, I earn more than some pro players.

7384
03:34:53,110 --> 03:34:54,270
Without a fucking doubt.

7385
03:34:55,730 --> 03:34:57,230
I'm pretty sure I do too, okay?

7386
03:34:58,450 --> 03:34:59,890
It's not the biggest flex.

7387
03:35:03,330 --> 03:35:03,770
Unreal.

7388
03:35:06,890 --> 03:35:08,810
It's gonna be... Wait, did they just win?

7389
03:35:09,010 --> 03:35:09,750
They just won.

7390
03:35:09,930 --> 03:35:10,090
Yeah.

7391
03:35:11,350 --> 03:35:12,730
What point did you guys get this game?

7392
03:35:13,370 --> 03:35:13,810
One.

7393
03:35:15,510 --> 03:35:16,890
They ran at us.

7394
03:35:17,870 --> 03:35:18,910
Bro, tell... Who's that?

7395
03:35:19,070 --> 03:35:19,910
Tell them to coach us.

7396
03:35:21,030 --> 03:35:22,190
Doki says coach us.

7397
03:35:23,110 --> 03:35:23,690
Coach us!

7398
03:35:24,770 --> 03:35:26,650
Hop in the Discord and coach us.

7399
03:35:26,750 --> 03:35:26,930
Yeah!

7400
03:35:27,510 --> 03:35:28,830
Oh wait, we're in ninth guys.

7401
03:35:28,950 --> 03:35:31,690
We're tied with five people, five teams for ninth to 13.

7402
03:35:31,690 --> 03:35:34,090
Guys, but like if we fuck up this game, we're not gonna be called.

7403
03:35:36,550 --> 03:35:38,650
We need us... We need coaches.

7404
03:35:38,650 --> 03:35:39,050
We need coaches.

7405
03:35:40,550 --> 03:35:40,830
Insane.

7406
03:35:40,870 --> 03:35:41,650
Oh, apparently I do.

7407
03:35:41,710 --> 03:35:43,650
You guys are my... I don't play Valk.

7408
03:35:43,930 --> 03:35:45,530
Remind me to scan care packages, bro.

7409
03:35:46,090 --> 03:35:46,370
Okay.

7410
03:35:47,030 --> 03:35:48,490
Yeah, that would help us with points.

7411
03:35:48,630 --> 03:35:50,030
I think we would have... I think we would have had blue.

7412
03:35:50,230 --> 03:35:50,510
Yeah.

7413
03:35:52,170 --> 03:35:53,350
I just forget, dude.

7414
03:35:57,960 --> 03:35:58,860
All right, code's up.

7415
03:35:58,900 --> 03:35:59,240
Let's go.

7416
03:36:00,120 --> 03:36:00,700
What was that?

7417
03:36:00,960 --> 03:36:01,240
We're tied.

7418
03:36:01,260 --> 03:36:04,060
We're 9, 10, 11, 12 all tied at 11 points.

7419
03:36:04,880 --> 03:36:05,740
Well, I shouldn't send that.

7420
03:36:05,820 --> 03:36:06,660
I really want to send that message.

7421
03:36:06,740 --> 03:36:07,320
I'm not gonna send it though.

7422
03:36:07,360 --> 03:36:07,960
I'm better than that.

7423
03:36:08,020 --> 03:36:08,440
I'm better than that.

7424
03:36:08,520 --> 03:36:08,700
Mm-hmm.

7425
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:11,080
I really want to send this.

7426
03:36:11,160 --> 03:36:12,000
Why do you guys suck?

7427
03:36:12,100 --> 03:36:12,700
Stop running.

7428
03:36:14,460 --> 03:36:16,380
We ran every time we fought them.

7429
03:36:17,440 --> 03:36:18,980
You want to say, why are you running?

7430
03:36:19,400 --> 03:36:19,880
No, no.

7431
03:36:19,900 --> 03:36:21,300
Why are you running at everyone?

7432
03:36:21,820 --> 03:36:22,460
Oh, yeah.

7433
03:36:22,540 --> 03:36:25,080
I thought you were gonna say... I thought you were gonna say, like, why are you running away from the visor?

7434
03:36:25,080 --> 03:36:26,120
Like, bro, this guy's got 30 kills.

7435
03:36:26,240 --> 03:36:26,480
I don't know.

7436
03:36:30,760 --> 03:36:31,700
All right, let's go, guys.

7437
03:36:31,760 --> 03:36:32,280
We got this, man.

7438
03:36:32,440 --> 03:36:32,860
This is it.

7439
03:36:32,880 --> 03:36:34,700
We're literally... They literally have a chance to qual.

7440
03:36:34,940 --> 03:36:37,680
And we just got two, zero... 1.0 point game, dude.

7441
03:36:37,860 --> 03:36:40,540
We just need... We literally need, like, good placements.

7442
03:36:40,580 --> 03:36:41,100
That's all we need.

7443
03:36:41,100 --> 03:36:43,980
All we need is literally not to die to Team 2.

7444
03:36:44,160 --> 03:36:45,320
That's literally all we need.

7445
03:36:46,380 --> 03:36:49,840
We just need Team 2 to run everyone else down.

7446
03:36:49,980 --> 03:36:50,780
Yes, yes, yes.

7447
03:36:50,900 --> 03:36:52,820
We need you to stay the fuck away from these guys, please.

7448
03:36:53,680 --> 03:36:54,700
In-game and out.

7449
03:36:55,920 --> 03:36:56,320
Please.

7450
03:36:56,620 --> 03:36:57,780
Please leave us alone.

7451
03:36:58,300 --> 03:36:59,260
Leave us alone.

7452
03:37:00,780 --> 03:37:01,180
Please.

7453
03:37:04,040 --> 03:37:05,960
What did we do to deserve it?

7454
03:37:06,040 --> 03:37:07,600
I scared everyone off.

7455
03:37:07,600 --> 03:37:07,860
We're good.

7456
03:37:08,040 --> 03:37:08,680
Wait, what did you say?

7457
03:37:08,700 --> 03:37:09,140
Nice, bro.

7458
03:37:09,140 --> 03:37:11,500
You think you got swing like that?

7459
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:12,420
I can't think about that.

7460
03:37:13,720 --> 03:37:15,700
That's the minus Tempo confidence I need, bro.

7461
03:37:16,100 --> 03:37:19,800
Everyone... They come to me to host the tournaments anyway, so...

7462
03:37:19,800 --> 03:37:21,620
I'll just be like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7463
03:37:21,740 --> 03:37:25,200
This guy... This team just apes everything, so they're not good for the tournament.

7464
03:37:26,080 --> 03:37:27,200
That's insane, bro.

7465
03:37:27,240 --> 03:37:28,040
That's insane.

7466
03:37:28,280 --> 03:37:28,660
That's unfortunate.

7467
03:37:29,400 --> 03:37:30,620
We should run everyone.

7468
03:37:34,640 --> 03:37:37,140
For actual Reddit reasons, that's a joke, by the way.

7469
03:37:37,160 --> 03:37:38,020
Tempo would not do that.

7470
03:37:39,140 --> 03:37:41,120
Yeah, for legal purposes, that is a...

7471
03:37:41,120 --> 03:37:42,580
I'm not joking.

7472
03:37:46,600 --> 03:37:49,480
For legal reasons, I'm not joking.

7473
03:37:59,320 --> 03:38:04,080
I can make these jokes because I'm not organizing any tournaments in Apex.

7474
03:38:05,520 --> 03:38:06,000
He...

7475
03:38:11,380 --> 03:38:13,080
I want to say it, so I'm not going to say it.

7476
03:38:13,140 --> 03:38:13,480
I'm not going to say it.

7477
03:38:13,480 --> 03:38:13,720
I'm going to...

7478
03:38:14,520 --> 03:38:16,500
I keep typing things and deleting it, you know what I mean?

7479
03:38:16,980 --> 03:38:17,620
What are you going to say?

7480
03:38:17,780 --> 03:38:18,200
What are you going to say?

7481
03:38:18,220 --> 03:38:19,720
No, type it to us, and then I'll say it.

7482
03:38:20,320 --> 03:38:21,260
No, no, no, no, no.

7483
03:38:22,900 --> 03:38:24,920
We're actually just saying what you look like, bro.

7484
03:38:25,020 --> 03:38:25,640
Oh, my God.

7485
03:38:25,720 --> 03:38:26,140
You're so smart.

7486
03:38:27,200 --> 03:38:27,880
Type it to me.

7487
03:38:27,880 --> 03:38:28,580
I'll say it.

7488
03:38:28,580 --> 03:38:30,180
I'll say it if you type it to me.

7489
03:38:30,660 --> 03:38:32,420
Yeah, it can't say it to a VTuber model.

7490
03:38:33,820 --> 03:38:34,480
What are you going to say?

7491
03:38:34,540 --> 03:38:35,260
Now I'm curious.

7492
03:38:35,420 --> 03:38:36,040
What are you going to say?

7493
03:38:37,980 --> 03:38:38,560
I'll tell you.

7494
03:38:42,040 --> 03:38:42,540
Bye, Asher.

7495
03:38:42,560 --> 03:38:42,700
Bye.

7496
03:38:45,540 --> 03:38:45,860
Bye.

7497
03:38:45,860 --> 03:38:46,200
What are you going to say?

7498
03:38:46,800 --> 03:38:47,580
All right, guys.

7499
03:38:47,800 --> 03:38:48,200
Don't worry.

7500
03:38:48,480 --> 03:38:48,800
Exclusives.

7501
03:38:49,500 --> 03:38:50,440
I won't say it.

7502
03:38:51,780 --> 03:38:52,100
Exclusives.

7503
03:38:53,040 --> 03:38:53,380
Oh, my God.

7504
03:38:53,380 --> 03:38:53,480
Thank God.

7505
03:38:53,720 --> 03:38:55,320
I'm trying to be better, bro.

7506
03:38:55,380 --> 03:38:55,920
I'm trying to be better.

7507
03:38:56,000 --> 03:38:56,400
I'm trying to be better.

7508
03:38:56,500 --> 03:38:57,080
Oh, my God.

7509
03:38:57,120 --> 03:38:58,080
I'm not, though.

7510
03:39:00,880 --> 03:39:03,860
A VTuber shit-talking you, bro, has got to be top three worst moments.

7511
03:39:03,940 --> 03:39:04,220
Okay.

7512
03:39:04,420 --> 03:39:05,140
I'm going to type it.

7513
03:39:05,300 --> 03:39:06,040
I'm going to...

7514
03:39:06,380 --> 03:39:07,520
You don't have to type that.

7515
03:39:07,820 --> 03:39:10,000
Yo, type it after we make it to the next round.

7516
03:39:10,080 --> 03:39:10,780
Okay, okay, okay.

7517
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:11,800
Yeah, snap it.

7518
03:39:11,800 --> 03:39:12,460
Okay, okay, okay.

7519
03:39:13,480 --> 03:39:13,900
Yeah, yeah.

7520
03:39:14,620 --> 03:39:16,560
Yeah, you save the shit-talk for when we're on top.

7521
03:39:16,720 --> 03:39:18,620
If we go out sad as fuck, we don't say anything.

7522
03:39:19,380 --> 03:39:20,240
No one will know.

7523
03:39:20,340 --> 03:39:21,080
Okay, how about this, bro?

7524
03:39:21,160 --> 03:39:24,380
If we lose, we don't make it past to the next round.

7525
03:39:24,520 --> 03:39:30,380
We go, like, literally all black profile pictures, everything on Twitter, and we go into our grind mode this week.

7526
03:39:30,680 --> 03:39:32,700
You go into grind mode?

7527
03:39:32,720 --> 03:39:33,200
Yeah, yeah.

7528
03:39:33,440 --> 03:39:34,120
Oh, my God.

7529
03:39:34,260 --> 03:39:35,660
It's like LeBron James in basketball.

7530
03:39:35,720 --> 03:39:38,140
In the off time, he goes full black profile picture, everything.

7531
03:39:38,280 --> 03:39:38,880
It just grinds.

7532
03:39:38,940 --> 03:39:42,800
And then we'll go to wig to grind mode, and then he'll be like, I'm sleeping, guys.

7533
03:39:42,800 --> 03:39:46,140
Yeah, then we're like, we woke up, we're like, all right, guys, we're ready for the practice.

7534
03:39:46,320 --> 03:39:47,560
I just woke up.

7535
03:39:47,660 --> 03:39:49,120
I'm ready to ALGS.

7536
03:39:51,440 --> 03:39:52,140
Let's be honest.

7537
03:39:52,200 --> 03:39:54,320
How much would have ranked really helped in this situation?

7538
03:39:54,520 --> 03:39:55,980
We got to the same team three games in a row.

7539
03:39:56,040 --> 03:39:57,680
It would have helped so much.

7540
03:39:57,900 --> 03:40:01,180
Because I would be practicing instead of playing other games.

7541
03:40:01,980 --> 03:40:03,040
What games were you playing?

7542
03:40:03,400 --> 03:40:05,700
I was playing anything I was streaming, you know?

7543
03:40:07,440 --> 03:40:08,760
Dart underscore game.

7544
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:11,780
Dart underscore game is crazy.

7545
03:40:11,820 --> 03:40:12,180
Dart underscore game is crazy.

7546
03:40:12,960 --> 03:40:13,760
Yeah, actually.

7547
03:40:15,460 --> 03:40:17,360
Let's see, what was I streaming?

7548
03:40:18,260 --> 03:40:20,340
Time is like non-existent for me now.

7549
03:40:21,320 --> 03:40:22,580
I was playing Roblox.

7550
03:40:22,600 --> 03:40:25,140
Yeah, instead of playing Apex, I was playing Roblox.

7551
03:40:25,240 --> 03:40:27,680
Oh, you were playing Roblox instead of Apex?

7552
03:40:29,320 --> 03:40:32,460
I was playing a visual novel.

7553
03:40:32,940 --> 03:40:35,480
And then I was playing Halo.

7554
03:40:35,640 --> 03:40:37,380
I was playing a South Park game.

7555
03:40:37,720 --> 03:40:38,560
I was playing...

7556
03:40:40,080 --> 03:40:42,320
Look, I was playing everything but Apex.

7557
03:40:43,020 --> 03:40:47,880
The only time I played Apex was the Nessie Cup and the JP tournament I did.

7558
03:40:48,860 --> 03:40:50,500
There's tournaments back to back.

7559
03:40:51,100 --> 03:40:51,900
That's true.

7560
03:40:52,060 --> 03:40:52,460
That's true.

7561
03:40:52,900 --> 03:40:53,920
Yeah, for real.

7562
03:40:59,260 --> 03:41:01,380
Start the... where the fuck is...

7563
03:41:01,380 --> 03:41:02,360
Start without him.

7564
03:41:02,440 --> 03:41:03,200
Start without...

7565
03:41:04,820 --> 03:41:06,720
Start without that team member.

7566
03:41:11,380 --> 03:41:13,240
Not what the fuck admin.

7567
03:41:14,760 --> 03:41:17,180
Not what the fuck admin Talarian did.

7568
03:41:18,560 --> 03:41:19,680
We could have had a chance.

7569
03:41:20,080 --> 03:41:22,180
We could have... alright, it would have been possible.

7570
03:41:22,340 --> 03:41:28,240
Okay, this really shows me though that like if we genuinely just didn't die to team 2 every game so far, that we could actually...

7571
03:41:28,240 --> 03:41:28,340
We would have made it.

7572
03:41:28,600 --> 03:41:29,540
Yeah, without a doubt.

7573
03:41:30,080 --> 03:41:30,440
100%.

7574
03:41:30,440 --> 03:41:35,220
Because we are literally just died to one point in two games and we're still almost qual.

7575
03:41:35,660 --> 03:41:36,020
Yeah.

7576
03:41:36,260 --> 03:41:36,460
We're good.

7577
03:41:37,080 --> 03:41:37,560
We're good.

7578
03:41:37,620 --> 03:41:37,980
We got this shit.

7579
03:41:38,020 --> 03:41:38,180
Let's go.

7580
03:41:38,300 --> 03:41:38,860
We got this shit.

7581
03:41:39,480 --> 03:41:40,000
I'm ready.

7582
03:41:40,720 --> 03:41:41,620
I'm ready too.

7583
03:41:42,120 --> 03:41:42,660
I'm ready.

7584
03:41:44,880 --> 03:41:46,420
Alrighty, we go back again I guess too.

7585
03:41:55,600 --> 03:41:56,520
This is it.

7586
03:42:01,320 --> 03:42:02,860
This is the game.

7587
03:42:03,960 --> 03:42:05,380
Chat said we're hosting a podcast.

7588
03:42:08,340 --> 03:42:10,060
It's not even a game anymore.

7589
03:42:10,060 --> 03:42:11,820
We're just podcasting.

7590
03:42:11,900 --> 03:42:13,120
Who is this person?

7591
03:42:13,200 --> 03:42:14,260
I'm betting him from a house chat.

7592
03:42:15,240 --> 03:42:17,620
You're betting him from a house chat.

7593
03:42:17,960 --> 03:42:19,100
I was just threatening everyone.

7594
03:42:19,540 --> 03:42:20,280
Bro, he's...

7595
03:42:20,280 --> 03:42:21,660
Alright, we're going Pylon, right?

7596
03:42:21,720 --> 03:42:21,920
Pylon?

7597
03:42:22,160 --> 03:42:22,820
Yeah, Pylon.

7598
03:42:23,300 --> 03:42:24,600
We don't have a beacon again.

7599
03:42:24,600 --> 03:42:25,260
Wait, wait, wait.

7600
03:42:25,400 --> 03:42:27,320
But we can rotate into Jurassic if no one goes there.

7601
03:42:27,320 --> 03:42:27,440
Yeah, that's fine.

7602
03:42:28,120 --> 03:42:28,640
That's fine.

7603
03:42:28,780 --> 03:42:33,800
Honestly, if no one goes in this direction, I might just land...

7604
03:42:33,800 --> 03:42:34,160
Land Jurassic.

7605
03:42:36,600 --> 03:42:37,900
Is there anyone checkpoint this time?

7606
03:42:37,960 --> 03:42:38,180
There is.

7607
03:42:38,180 --> 03:42:38,880
Yeah, this team's going checkpoint.

7608
03:42:39,780 --> 03:42:41,200
We should definitely drop soon.

7609
03:42:41,240 --> 03:42:41,480
Drop now.

7610
03:42:41,640 --> 03:42:42,140
Yeah, I want to drop now.

7611
03:42:43,260 --> 03:42:45,220
Hopefully these teams are not going there.

7612
03:42:45,540 --> 03:42:46,400
They might be, bro.

7613
03:42:46,480 --> 03:42:47,600
If they are, we just sort of Jurassic.

7614
03:42:47,700 --> 03:42:50,860
That right team looks like they're going far right.

7615
03:42:50,920 --> 03:42:51,900
Yeah, they're going CETO.

7616
03:42:52,360 --> 03:42:53,780
I think this team might be on us here.

7617
03:42:53,980 --> 03:42:54,580
This team might be on us here.

7618
03:42:54,580 --> 03:42:55,500
This team might be right beside us on our top left.

7619
03:42:55,500 --> 03:42:56,520
There's a team above us too.

7620
03:42:56,740 --> 03:42:57,920
And the team to our left.

7621
03:42:58,820 --> 03:42:59,900
I mean, Jurassic's free.

7622
03:42:59,980 --> 03:43:00,440
I don't want to contest.

7623
03:43:00,740 --> 03:43:01,400
I definitely don't want to leave them.

7624
03:43:02,540 --> 03:43:03,300
I think it's Jurassic.

7625
03:43:03,740 --> 03:43:04,580
I'm looking right now.

7626
03:43:05,120 --> 03:43:05,760
Yeah, we're going Jurassic.

7627
03:43:06,520 --> 03:43:07,700
They're landing on Pylon.

7628
03:43:08,340 --> 03:43:09,480
There's two teams Pylon.

7629
03:43:09,740 --> 03:43:10,440
What the fuck?

7630
03:43:11,300 --> 03:43:12,380
Okay, so I'm going Pylon.

7631
03:43:12,540 --> 03:43:14,960
Do you think that checkpoint team just left and was like, fuck it?

7632
03:43:15,180 --> 03:43:15,640
No, no.

7633
03:43:15,660 --> 03:43:16,240
I saw them going there.

7634
03:43:16,300 --> 03:43:16,540
We're good.

7635
03:43:16,700 --> 03:43:17,520
They're 100% on there.

7636
03:43:17,660 --> 03:43:19,540
It would have been nice though because they had a double beacon and we went there.

7637
03:43:19,720 --> 03:43:20,220
We're good though.

7638
03:43:20,220 --> 03:43:20,580
We got the shit.

7639
03:43:20,640 --> 03:43:20,840
Let's do it.

7640
03:43:22,000 --> 03:43:23,040
I can't scan yet.

7641
03:43:23,100 --> 03:43:23,360
Fuck.

7642
03:43:23,360 --> 03:43:23,980
No, you can't.

7643
03:43:23,980 --> 03:43:24,180
You're good.

7644
03:43:24,260 --> 03:43:24,420
You're good.

7645
03:43:24,420 --> 03:43:27,000
Yeah, we have ring console, which is literally all we need for getting these points.

7646
03:43:27,120 --> 03:43:27,820
Literally all we need.

7647
03:43:28,040 --> 03:43:28,760
We'll see what happens.

7648
03:43:31,200 --> 03:43:34,600
Well, our team is definitely going to run at us to get beacon as well.

7649
03:43:35,640 --> 03:43:36,000
True.

7650
03:43:36,120 --> 03:43:39,360
We don't have any like things for scan stuff.

7651
03:43:40,220 --> 03:43:40,820
Oh my God.

7652
03:43:40,840 --> 03:43:41,180
I'll give this out.

7653
03:43:41,200 --> 03:43:41,860
That's huge for us.

7654
03:43:42,180 --> 03:43:43,860
I'm going to loot inside here.

7655
03:43:44,160 --> 03:43:46,100
It's going to end Cito slash Bean for sure.

7656
03:43:46,100 --> 03:43:47,180
I'm going to loot this.

7657
03:43:47,580 --> 03:43:48,060
All right.

7658
03:43:48,080 --> 03:43:48,480
Sounds good.

7659
03:43:49,240 --> 03:43:51,360
We really need an Evo cache though.

7660
03:43:51,380 --> 03:43:51,860
We don't.

7661
03:43:51,860 --> 03:43:52,500
No, we don't.

7662
03:43:52,500 --> 03:43:53,280
Yeah, it's so bad.

7663
03:43:53,320 --> 03:43:53,340
We're going to loot this.

7664
03:43:54,220 --> 03:43:54,800
It's all good, baby.

7665
03:43:54,860 --> 03:43:55,100
All good.

7666
03:43:55,160 --> 03:43:55,580
We got this.

7667
03:43:57,080 --> 03:43:57,640
Where is there?

7668
03:43:57,660 --> 03:43:58,580
What's the closest Evo?

7669
03:43:58,680 --> 03:43:59,300
Oh my gosh.

7670
03:43:59,340 --> 03:44:00,620
There's no nothing that's close.

7671
03:44:01,780 --> 03:44:07,020
We're going to need you to scan like, scan the boxes then.

7672
03:44:08,240 --> 03:44:09,320
Yeah, this is going to be tough.

7673
03:44:09,460 --> 03:44:10,520
When I get the care package, I will.

7674
03:44:10,660 --> 03:44:11,580
But it's not going to get us enough.

7675
03:44:19,290 --> 03:44:19,570
Okay.

7676
03:44:19,630 --> 03:44:22,690
I mean, at least not awful, awful, I guess.

7677
03:44:24,010 --> 03:44:25,570
Just the white armor is going to be tough for now, Evo.

7678
03:44:26,090 --> 03:44:26,370
Fine.

7679
03:44:26,470 --> 03:44:27,150
We could rotate through.

7680
03:44:27,650 --> 03:44:28,290
I'm going to go back.

7681
03:44:28,550 --> 03:44:29,530
Maybe I go over.

7682
03:44:29,570 --> 03:44:30,490
I don't want to go there now though.

7683
03:44:30,510 --> 03:44:31,650
This pile on too much to come through.

7684
03:44:31,750 --> 03:44:34,110
I was just saying, I probably should have went over to the nut and just got the Evo cache over there.

7685
03:44:35,910 --> 03:44:36,930
I could still do it to be honest.

7686
03:44:37,170 --> 03:44:38,050
Should I risk anything or no?

7687
03:44:38,410 --> 03:44:38,890
For what?

7688
03:44:39,530 --> 03:44:41,150
Go over here to this nut and get the Evo cache?

7689
03:44:41,410 --> 03:44:41,550
Yeah.

7690
03:44:41,610 --> 03:44:43,070
I feel like you should at this point.

7691
03:44:43,290 --> 03:44:44,510
We don't have anything.

7692
03:44:45,230 --> 03:44:48,770
I think I do too because regardless of what the fuck happens, we're just, we're going to die.

7693
03:44:49,590 --> 03:44:51,010
Like if we don't have, yeah.

7694
03:44:52,290 --> 03:44:53,330
Wait, this guy's routing it.

7695
03:44:54,010 --> 03:44:54,350
Wait, what?

7696
03:44:54,350 --> 03:44:54,690
They're routing the Evo.

7697
03:44:55,130 --> 03:44:55,690
Okay, nevermind.

7698
03:44:55,690 --> 03:44:56,090
I don't.

7699
03:44:56,790 --> 03:44:58,090
This guy was just head coaching the Evo.

7700
03:44:58,330 --> 03:44:58,990
What the fuck?

7701
03:44:59,050 --> 03:44:59,550
I'm coming back.

7702
03:44:59,790 --> 03:45:00,530
Was that person?

7703
03:45:00,630 --> 03:45:01,330
That had to be a person.

7704
03:45:01,450 --> 03:45:02,930
That's why my fucking graphics were fucked up.

7705
03:45:03,630 --> 03:45:04,850
No, yeah, that thing's not there anymore.

7706
03:45:07,070 --> 03:45:08,530
Yeah, I just got scammed by pile on too.

7707
03:45:09,190 --> 03:45:10,510
We should just start rotating this down.

7708
03:45:10,550 --> 03:45:11,090
It's good to see this die.

7709
03:45:11,510 --> 03:45:13,450
I don't have an open cell for anything.

7710
03:45:14,190 --> 03:45:14,790
I have a note.

7711
03:45:14,910 --> 03:45:16,210
I'll give mine too.

7712
03:45:16,350 --> 03:45:17,570
Do you want me to hold it or you want to use it now?

7713
03:45:18,270 --> 03:45:19,390
I think we just, do we save it?

7714
03:45:19,430 --> 03:45:19,710
We're fine.

7715
03:45:20,530 --> 03:45:21,530
I'll walk in a little bit more.

7716
03:45:22,110 --> 03:45:23,470
We definitely need an Evo.

7717
03:45:25,290 --> 03:45:27,310
I'm going to try and grab this Evo.

7718
03:45:28,030 --> 03:45:30,470
It might be hard, but I can't do it.

7719
03:45:30,630 --> 03:45:32,230
I mean, the white armor is so...

7720
03:45:32,230 --> 03:45:34,030
I can't walk into the map because the team's going to int everything.

7721
03:45:35,050 --> 03:45:36,410
And there's Cedar Station.

7722
03:45:36,570 --> 03:45:37,190
They're right here too.

7723
03:45:37,250 --> 03:45:37,670
They're moving across.

7724
03:45:39,690 --> 03:45:41,750
The white armor is just really fucking rough though.

7725
03:45:41,790 --> 03:45:42,090
Yeah.

7726
03:45:43,470 --> 03:45:44,570
Well, let's just slide down.

7727
03:45:44,590 --> 03:45:45,170
Just play from here.

7728
03:45:45,550 --> 03:45:49,710
Maybe try to get some shots first before we rotate into actual center zone because you have nothing to fucking do.

7729
03:45:49,950 --> 03:45:50,470
Wait, I'm not ready.

7730
03:45:50,650 --> 03:45:52,130
I'm coming back to you guys.

7731
03:45:52,130 --> 03:45:53,010
Okay, I'm backing up.

7732
03:45:53,010 --> 03:45:53,410
I'm backing up.

7733
03:45:53,550 --> 03:45:55,430
The white armor is just so rough, man.

7734
03:45:55,510 --> 03:45:55,710
Fuck.

7735
03:45:55,750 --> 03:45:56,590
We're going to get sandwiched here too.

7736
03:45:57,250 --> 03:45:59,550
All right, we should actually rotate down here, I think, and try to get that Evo.

7737
03:45:59,650 --> 03:45:59,930
Okay.

7738
03:46:00,090 --> 03:46:00,770
I think you're right, Doki.

7739
03:46:01,250 --> 03:46:02,030
Just keep going this way.

7740
03:46:02,090 --> 03:46:02,850
I'm trying to.

7741
03:46:03,510 --> 03:46:03,990
Yeah, you're good.

7742
03:46:04,010 --> 03:46:04,350
You guys are fine.

7743
03:46:04,430 --> 03:46:04,850
We should be fine.

7744
03:46:05,170 --> 03:46:06,190
We have no choice now.

7745
03:46:07,270 --> 03:46:08,310
Can we grab that one at blue?

7746
03:46:09,370 --> 03:46:10,310
Yeah, we should be fine.

7747
03:46:10,430 --> 03:46:13,270
At least we get blue, which is just, at this point, way better.

7748
03:46:13,310 --> 03:46:15,330
Like, that's just better for us in the long run.

7749
03:46:16,010 --> 03:46:18,230
Yeah, we're getting fucked over right now, but we're doing good.

7750
03:46:18,290 --> 03:46:18,570
We're fine.

7751
03:46:19,230 --> 03:46:19,830
That's what it is.

7752
03:46:19,870 --> 03:46:20,290
We don't have a choice.

7753
03:46:20,710 --> 03:46:23,410
Let's get this Evo cache, and then I think we just literally play in this building.

7754
03:46:23,810 --> 03:46:24,710
Well, I see a trophy shop.

7755
03:46:25,990 --> 03:46:26,950
Yeah, there's a team there.

7756
03:46:27,010 --> 03:46:27,450
There's a team there.

7757
03:46:29,030 --> 03:46:29,310
It's okay.

7758
03:46:29,450 --> 03:46:29,970
Let them go.

7759
03:46:30,070 --> 03:46:31,210
Maybe we can get the Evo when they rotate out.

7760
03:46:31,290 --> 03:46:32,190
I'm just going to play in this building right now.

7761
03:46:32,710 --> 03:46:33,410
I'm going in.

7762
03:46:33,450 --> 03:46:33,810
I'm going in.

7763
03:46:34,070 --> 03:46:34,850
Yeah, you're inside.

7764
03:46:35,190 --> 03:46:35,510
We're good.

7765
03:46:35,650 --> 03:46:36,370
We don't really have a choice.

7766
03:46:39,110 --> 03:46:40,670
This team left the Evo cache, though.

7767
03:46:40,830 --> 03:46:41,890
But there's still a team on the left side.

7768
03:46:41,930 --> 03:46:42,730
I don't want to go over there yet.

7769
03:46:43,890 --> 03:46:44,670
Barometer team's going far.

7770
03:46:47,090 --> 03:46:48,930
Flying up and seeing if I can actually see what they're doing.

7771
03:46:49,470 --> 03:46:50,490
I think I got the Evo cache.

7772
03:46:50,670 --> 03:46:51,250
You guys stay here, alright?

7773
03:46:51,410 --> 03:46:51,730
Yep.

7774
03:46:51,850 --> 03:46:52,790
I'm going to charge rifle.

7775
03:46:53,110 --> 03:46:54,270
I'm going to charge rifle barometer.

7776
03:46:54,670 --> 03:46:56,210
Yeah, if I die, then fuck it.

7777
03:46:56,730 --> 03:47:02,710
We can... I mean, we have evac and your ult, so we can use either to try and get a better position.

7778
03:47:03,310 --> 03:47:05,790
No, we definitely want to try to get in somewhere and get a good spot for some.

7779
03:47:06,210 --> 03:47:07,790
I got the Evo, by the way.

7780
03:47:08,090 --> 03:47:08,230
Alright, nice.

7781
03:47:09,390 --> 03:47:09,810
That's good.

7782
03:47:09,870 --> 03:47:10,190
Good start.

7783
03:47:10,450 --> 03:47:11,970
Should we go to you or...

7784
03:47:11,970 --> 03:47:13,390
Okay, they're top barometer now.

7785
03:47:13,830 --> 03:47:15,130
Yeah, they're just showing top barometer.

7786
03:47:15,230 --> 03:47:15,610
I don't know.

7787
03:47:15,750 --> 03:47:17,150
So, like, here's my dilemma, guys.

7788
03:47:17,250 --> 03:47:18,910
Like, I want to go over there, but they're going to run me.

7789
03:47:18,930 --> 03:47:20,130
They're going to run down everything from Cedar.

7790
03:47:21,230 --> 03:47:24,150
Like, even with blue armors, I still think they're going to just fight us regardless.

7791
03:47:24,430 --> 03:47:24,750
Yeah, I agree.

7792
03:47:24,750 --> 03:47:27,570
They have prowlers and probably burp purples, which is so fucked.

7793
03:47:27,730 --> 03:47:32,650
What we could do, though, is we could hit an ulti and fly into front side Cedar right there over on the back side.

7794
03:47:32,790 --> 03:47:33,890
I just don't know if it's going to be safe or not.

7795
03:47:34,510 --> 03:47:35,230
I think like...

7796
03:47:35,230 --> 03:47:35,730
If it's not, we're fucked.

7797
03:47:36,210 --> 03:47:38,190
I think it's better than being here, right?

7798
03:47:38,230 --> 03:47:41,130
We want to just stay here and see more teams dying first.

7799
03:47:41,410 --> 03:47:43,150
I think it's going to be better over there, for sure.

7800
03:47:43,550 --> 03:47:43,870
Yeah.

7801
03:47:44,370 --> 03:47:46,590
I think we just go on roof and we hear my Valko.

7802
03:47:46,630 --> 03:47:47,350
Okay, we're here.

7803
03:47:47,970 --> 03:47:48,530
Let's try it.

7804
03:47:48,550 --> 03:47:48,850
Why not, right?

7805
03:47:48,930 --> 03:47:49,210
Okay.

7806
03:47:50,210 --> 03:47:51,690
We got to make a play for a zone here, I think.

7807
03:47:51,750 --> 03:47:52,050
Here we go.

7808
03:47:53,850 --> 03:47:57,370
All right, we're going to try to get to the front spot and see what happens if there is a team in there.

7809
03:47:57,510 --> 03:47:58,550
If there's a team in there, we're dead.

7810
03:47:58,670 --> 03:47:59,290
There's a team here.

7811
03:48:00,290 --> 03:48:02,050
There's a team...

7812
03:48:02,690 --> 03:48:03,470
Not one in here, right?

7813
03:48:03,510 --> 03:48:03,830
Not one in here.

7814
03:48:03,850 --> 03:48:04,390
I can't see.

7815
03:48:04,430 --> 03:48:05,070
I can't see right now.

7816
03:48:05,170 --> 03:48:05,510
Nothing's pinging.

7817
03:48:05,990 --> 03:48:06,330
Door's open.

7818
03:48:06,350 --> 03:48:06,690
Door's open.

7819
03:48:06,730 --> 03:48:06,950
We're good.

7820
03:48:06,990 --> 03:48:07,170
We're good.

7821
03:48:07,250 --> 03:48:07,690
Just land inside.

7822
03:48:09,190 --> 03:48:10,030
It's the right side of the door.

7823
03:48:10,570 --> 03:48:11,030
Oh, I...

7824
03:48:11,610 --> 03:48:11,910
We're good.

7825
03:48:11,950 --> 03:48:12,110
We're good.

7826
03:48:12,350 --> 03:48:13,130
Pinging off the door.

7827
03:48:13,370 --> 03:48:13,610
Okay.

7828
03:48:13,730 --> 03:48:14,830
We have a good spawn zone right now.

7829
03:48:14,890 --> 03:48:15,630
We shouldn't get inted.

7830
03:48:15,650 --> 03:48:17,930
I just want this team to run down everybody that's not us.

7831
03:48:18,670 --> 03:48:18,910
Okay.

7832
03:48:18,930 --> 03:48:20,230
Where's the best place for this?

7833
03:48:21,450 --> 03:48:21,730
Jen?

7834
03:48:21,730 --> 03:48:23,090
Jen would probably be like literally right here.

7835
03:48:23,090 --> 03:48:24,070
There's a rez in front of us too.

7836
03:48:25,550 --> 03:48:26,750
Or back to your tempo to be honest.

7837
03:48:26,770 --> 03:48:27,190
Right here too.

7838
03:48:27,250 --> 03:48:27,690
It's really good.

7839
03:48:30,010 --> 03:48:30,430
There you go.

7840
03:48:30,470 --> 03:48:30,650
That's fine.

7841
03:48:30,730 --> 03:48:32,350
I want to put it away from what's their face.

7842
03:48:32,590 --> 03:48:35,390
Yeah, and if you could fence the outside tempo a little bit too instead of inside as well.

7843
03:48:35,650 --> 03:48:38,810
Oh yeah, do you want the ulti-exile or do you want to charge it up passively?

7844
03:48:39,450 --> 03:48:40,170
I think you're good.

7845
03:48:40,270 --> 03:48:41,130
I think it's charged up passively.

7846
03:48:41,190 --> 03:48:41,370
Good job.

7847
03:48:42,770 --> 03:48:43,850
We live here now.

7848
03:48:46,570 --> 03:48:46,850
Alrighty.

7849
03:48:48,010 --> 03:48:48,350
Come on.

7850
03:48:48,930 --> 03:48:48,970
Jesus.

7851
03:48:49,470 --> 03:48:50,610
Oh, look at the outside.

7852
03:48:50,610 --> 03:48:51,210
We did something.

7853
03:48:51,330 --> 03:48:51,790
Good job.

7854
03:48:53,010 --> 03:48:55,050
Thank you for the plus 50.

7855
03:48:58,430 --> 03:48:58,950
Good job.

7856
03:48:59,010 --> 03:48:59,950
Good fences, tempo, good shit.

7857
03:49:01,070 --> 03:49:01,390
Whoa!

7858
03:49:01,770 --> 03:49:03,050
What the fucking shit?

7859
03:49:04,130 --> 03:49:04,490
You're good.

7860
03:49:04,550 --> 03:49:04,670
You're good.

7861
03:49:04,670 --> 03:49:04,670
You're good.

7862
03:49:04,670 --> 03:49:05,250
I'm looking over here.

7863
03:49:05,290 --> 03:49:05,590
Okay.

7864
03:49:05,690 --> 03:49:05,990
Okay.

7865
03:49:06,250 --> 03:49:06,870
You're not coming down yet.

7866
03:49:06,870 --> 03:49:07,510
You're good.

7867
03:49:08,310 --> 03:49:09,010
I cracked my top.

7868
03:49:09,730 --> 03:49:10,090
I'm fine.

7869
03:49:10,150 --> 03:49:10,650
I'm fine.

7870
03:49:10,770 --> 03:49:12,230
I was just looking at the flies.

7871
03:49:12,950 --> 03:49:13,550
Yeah, you're good.

7872
03:49:13,610 --> 03:49:13,930
They're white armor.

7873
03:49:14,130 --> 03:49:14,830
You're on white?

7874
03:49:14,930 --> 03:49:16,470
Do we ape those fuckers for shooting us?

7875
03:49:16,490 --> 03:49:16,710
No.

7876
03:49:16,950 --> 03:49:18,410
We should not ape.

7877
03:49:18,670 --> 03:49:19,570
Where did we get shot?

7878
03:49:19,790 --> 03:49:20,710
Did I get shot from behind?

7879
03:49:20,870 --> 03:49:21,910
I have no shells, by the way.

7880
03:49:22,030 --> 03:49:22,690
Just realize that.

7881
03:49:22,990 --> 03:49:24,470
Oh, I have more shells.

7882
03:49:24,630 --> 03:49:24,810
Yeah.

7883
03:49:25,450 --> 03:49:26,890
I got, I got like...

7884
03:49:26,890 --> 03:49:27,690
Open this door.

7885
03:49:28,190 --> 03:49:28,990
How about a...

7886
03:49:29,390 --> 03:49:30,030
How about a...

7887
03:49:30,030 --> 03:49:30,150
How about a...

7888
03:49:30,150 --> 03:49:30,870
How about a...

7889
03:49:31,910 --> 03:49:32,750
Hey, one point.

7890
03:49:32,850 --> 03:49:33,090
Hey, one point.

7891
03:49:33,570 --> 03:49:33,890
Nice.

7892
03:49:33,910 --> 03:49:34,490
Yeah, one point's fine.

7893
03:49:34,570 --> 03:49:34,850
That's good.

7894
03:49:35,010 --> 03:49:35,330
Nice.

7895
03:49:35,510 --> 03:49:36,250
Wait, we just chill.

7896
03:49:36,950 --> 03:49:38,190
Yeah, we just vibe the fuck out.

7897
03:49:38,310 --> 03:49:40,550
I mean, again, we just literally can't get into it.

7898
03:49:40,650 --> 03:49:43,930
Having these guys in your lobby until like the later rounds is just an awful experience.

7899
03:49:44,050 --> 03:49:44,390
So we're fine.

7900
03:49:45,110 --> 03:49:45,610
That's what it is.

7901
03:49:47,870 --> 03:49:48,330
We're doing well.

7902
03:49:48,350 --> 03:49:48,390
We're doing well.

7903
03:49:48,390 --> 03:49:48,810
Oh, wait, wait.

7904
03:49:48,910 --> 03:49:50,470
I can shoot those idiots up there.

7905
03:49:50,570 --> 03:49:51,970
Don't get on the roof, Tempo.

7906
03:49:52,070 --> 03:49:52,530
You're on the roof.

7907
03:49:53,150 --> 03:49:55,430
Tempo, get the fuck off the roof, Tempo.

7908
03:49:55,870 --> 03:49:57,990
Tempo, get the fuck off the roof.

7909
03:49:58,490 --> 03:49:59,550
They jumped off.

7910
03:49:59,590 --> 03:49:59,910
We're good.

7911
03:50:00,270 --> 03:50:01,330
I scared them.

7912
03:50:01,890 --> 03:50:02,850
I'll do it in here.

7913
03:50:03,350 --> 03:50:03,990
Yeah, that's fine.

7914
03:50:04,250 --> 03:50:06,270
You're a gigantic football-sized head.

7915
03:50:06,890 --> 03:50:07,330
Me?

7916
03:50:07,390 --> 03:50:08,510
Or you or Doki?

7917
03:50:09,610 --> 03:50:10,490
Who's Bloodhound?

7918
03:50:10,690 --> 03:50:11,090
I don't know.

7919
03:50:11,330 --> 03:50:13,130
How do you not know who's Bloodhound?

7920
03:50:13,470 --> 03:50:14,570
I'm Bloodhound.

7921
03:50:14,850 --> 03:50:16,090
How do you not know who's Bloodhound?

7922
03:50:16,370 --> 03:50:16,810
Oh, yes.

7923
03:50:16,810 --> 03:50:17,130
Dead.

7924
03:50:17,130 --> 03:50:18,670
Their horizon is killing people.

7925
03:50:20,010 --> 03:50:21,830
They're just going to feed everything off and we're just good.

7926
03:50:22,010 --> 03:50:24,090
There should be more teams than having zero points than us.

7927
03:50:24,490 --> 03:50:25,010
For sure.

7928
03:50:25,350 --> 03:50:25,890
Which is good.

7929
03:50:26,310 --> 03:50:28,690
What were the teams that had... who were below us?

7930
03:50:29,150 --> 03:50:30,050
I have no idea.

7931
03:50:30,110 --> 03:50:30,610
I didn't see the names.

7932
03:50:30,910 --> 03:50:33,110
They were like 9 and 8 and 7.

7933
03:50:33,350 --> 03:50:34,130
9, 8, and 7?

7934
03:50:34,330 --> 03:50:35,910
I don't know if I saw their names yet.

7935
03:50:36,030 --> 03:50:36,590
Like points.

7936
03:50:37,430 --> 03:50:37,750
Oh.

7937
03:50:38,330 --> 03:50:41,070
So if they get any amount of points, that's not good for us.

7938
03:50:41,310 --> 03:50:41,670
No, no, no.

7939
03:50:41,690 --> 03:50:44,210
I meant like... is it team 9 or team 8?

7940
03:50:44,230 --> 03:50:44,890
Oh, I have no idea.

7941
03:50:45,130 --> 03:50:45,450
Oh, okay.

7942
03:50:45,510 --> 03:50:46,610
I thought you meant like...

7943
03:50:46,610 --> 03:50:47,050
No.

7944
03:50:47,610 --> 03:50:49,530
I thought you meant you know their team numbers.

7945
03:50:50,450 --> 03:50:51,890
Because I could just look at the numbers.

7946
03:50:52,690 --> 03:50:54,010
What do the numbers say?

7947
03:50:57,260 --> 03:50:58,560
I'm not going to peek right now.

7948
03:51:00,800 --> 03:51:02,440
I actually don't even know where they are.

7949
03:51:07,390 --> 03:51:11,630
Where are you shooting from?

7950
03:51:12,570 --> 03:51:13,490
They're shooting at me.

7951
03:51:14,290 --> 03:51:15,050
Yeah, but where?

7952
03:51:15,270 --> 03:51:15,810
You ping them?

7953
03:51:16,070 --> 03:51:16,730
I can look at them.

7954
03:51:16,730 --> 03:51:17,130
From over here.

7955
03:51:17,830 --> 03:51:18,230
Oh.

7956
03:51:19,210 --> 03:51:20,050
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

7957
03:51:21,590 --> 03:51:22,030
Okay, okay.

7958
03:51:22,510 --> 03:51:22,830
Tempo.

7959
03:51:22,910 --> 03:51:23,150
Hello?

7960
03:51:23,570 --> 03:51:23,890
Open.

7961
03:51:23,890 --> 03:51:24,830
Open door, sesame.

7962
03:51:25,110 --> 03:51:26,550
Oh, what the fuck are you doing, Tempo?

7963
03:51:27,290 --> 03:51:29,590
I was trying to level up my thingy.

7964
03:51:29,630 --> 03:51:31,250
This man keeps going outside to scare me.

7965
03:51:31,290 --> 03:51:31,630
I know you're fine.

7966
03:51:31,630 --> 03:51:31,790
I know.

7967
03:51:31,790 --> 03:51:33,290
You don't have a lot of shields, dude.

7968
03:51:34,070 --> 03:51:35,630
You have multiple gems.

7969
03:51:35,870 --> 03:51:36,990
Yeah, we should have put on a gem.

7970
03:51:37,070 --> 03:51:37,450
Thank God.

7971
03:51:37,710 --> 03:51:38,390
Yeah, thank God.

7972
03:51:39,330 --> 03:51:39,930
It's all good though.

7973
03:51:40,090 --> 03:51:42,530
I mean, right now, I don't really know where the zone is going to go.

7974
03:51:42,610 --> 03:51:43,730
I think it's going to pull towards us personally.

7975
03:51:43,890 --> 03:51:45,130
But it could pull towards bean as well.

7976
03:51:45,770 --> 03:51:46,890
We'll find out soon.

7977
03:51:50,230 --> 03:51:51,030
We'll see you in a little bit.

7978
03:51:51,090 --> 03:51:51,570
A minute or two.

7979
03:51:53,030 --> 03:51:54,970
Do they have... they don't have console.

7980
03:51:55,190 --> 03:51:55,450
Oh.

7981
03:51:56,810 --> 03:51:59,430
I feel like I see a lot of teams like this way.

7982
03:51:59,610 --> 03:52:00,670
That's the scary part.

7983
03:52:00,870 --> 03:52:01,950
They have ring console.

7984
03:52:03,230 --> 03:52:04,610
Oh my balls.

7985
03:52:13,570 --> 03:52:14,330
I'm broke.

7986
03:52:14,490 --> 03:52:16,470
I have four cells and no bats.

7987
03:52:16,790 --> 03:52:17,910
And one syringe.

7988
03:52:18,870 --> 03:52:20,090
Wait you have one here.

7989
03:52:20,090 --> 03:52:21,030
I'll give you one syringe.

7990
03:52:21,310 --> 03:52:22,450
Yo I can get purple.

7991
03:52:23,030 --> 03:52:24,130
Okay how much more you have?

7992
03:52:24,370 --> 03:52:25,050
A thousand.

7993
03:52:25,350 --> 03:52:25,830
Dude.

7994
03:52:25,850 --> 03:52:26,330
Stop.

7995
03:52:26,450 --> 03:52:26,890
Stop.

7996
03:52:26,890 --> 03:52:27,990
That's only ten shots.

7997
03:52:28,310 --> 03:52:29,310
I have a thousand as well.

7998
03:52:30,690 --> 03:52:32,270
I'm also still a thousand.

7999
03:52:32,310 --> 03:52:33,330
I haven't shot once.

8000
03:52:35,250 --> 03:52:36,430
Only ten shots.

8001
03:52:36,550 --> 03:52:36,950
Don't worry.

8002
03:52:37,230 --> 03:52:37,830
Here here.

8003
03:52:37,890 --> 03:52:38,510
Here's a syringe.

8004
03:52:38,630 --> 03:52:39,290
I dropped a syringe.

8005
03:52:40,930 --> 03:52:41,410
Nice.

8006
03:52:42,250 --> 03:52:43,530
Take that syringe big doll.

8007
03:52:43,530 --> 03:52:47,650
He literally told us he had one syringe.

8008
03:52:47,910 --> 03:52:48,070
Oh yeah.

8009
03:52:49,130 --> 03:52:50,310
I have a med kit though.

8010
03:52:50,790 --> 03:52:51,890
Hell yeah you do baby.

8011
03:52:51,930 --> 03:52:52,670
Yeah you do.

8012
03:52:52,950 --> 03:52:54,150
Get that med kit.

8013
03:52:54,470 --> 03:52:55,870
Yeah you do that baby boy.

8014
03:52:57,530 --> 03:52:58,630
This is a podcast.

8015
03:53:00,950 --> 03:53:01,770
Yeah it is really.

8016
03:53:03,330 --> 03:53:05,150
Oh wait I saw something land somewhere.

8017
03:53:05,310 --> 03:53:06,050
I'm gonna go kill them.

8018
03:53:06,530 --> 03:53:09,430
Tempo if you get knocked out I'm never hanging out with you ever again.

8019
03:53:10,350 --> 03:53:11,630
Wait you were hanging out with him?

8020
03:53:12,590 --> 03:53:13,790
I can get this killed.

8021
03:53:14,290 --> 03:53:15,850
You were hanging out with him off screen?

8022
03:53:17,130 --> 03:53:18,170
I'm gonna fucking pull.

8023
03:53:18,230 --> 03:53:18,430
One sec.

8024
03:53:18,530 --> 03:53:19,930
I should have made a recon play here.

8025
03:53:20,250 --> 03:53:21,790
Tempo are you shooting someone over in the building?

8026
03:53:21,890 --> 03:53:22,130
Oh they are.

8027
03:53:22,230 --> 03:53:22,410
Okay.

8028
03:53:22,850 --> 03:53:24,050
I'm shooting like this way.

8029
03:53:24,850 --> 03:53:26,590
So like I don't want to leave yet.

8030
03:53:26,590 --> 03:53:30,310
I'm gonna go ahead but I can't lie a really good play would be taking underneath over here late game.

8031
03:53:31,390 --> 03:53:32,090
Like really late.

8032
03:53:32,650 --> 03:53:32,970
Okay.

8033
03:53:33,150 --> 03:53:34,750
There's also a spot in water we could take late game.

8034
03:53:34,790 --> 03:53:35,490
I don't want to leave yet though.

8035
03:53:35,550 --> 03:53:37,950
If we go there early I just don't know what's gonna happen with my 13 squads up.

8036
03:53:37,970 --> 03:53:38,970
We get out angles so hard.

8037
03:53:40,930 --> 03:53:43,170
Alright I'm just waiting for your thing to charge me up.

8038
03:53:43,610 --> 03:53:44,130
Me too.

8039
03:53:44,450 --> 03:53:45,110
Yeah you're good.

8040
03:53:45,230 --> 03:53:46,630
I'm not gonna use any of my meds.

8041
03:53:46,650 --> 03:53:47,750
I didn't want to fight three out of a Jurassic.

8042
03:53:47,950 --> 03:53:50,750
If no one comes from Bean's side to fight us this is actually really good.

8043
03:53:50,870 --> 03:53:54,490
If anyone does come from Bean we just need to get aggressive on the slide down from the hill.

8044
03:53:54,590 --> 03:53:55,250
That's all we need to do.

8045
03:53:55,330 --> 03:53:55,650
Okay.

8046
03:53:56,070 --> 03:53:57,410
We're gonna try to watch your back when you're slamming like that.

8047
03:53:57,430 --> 03:53:58,530
If you get killed from Bean we're dead.

8048
03:53:58,630 --> 03:53:59,550
Like we're just gonna get sent on.

8049
03:54:02,410 --> 03:54:03,510
Alright who scanned us?

8050
03:54:03,550 --> 03:54:04,030
Who scanned us?

8051
03:54:04,150 --> 03:54:05,010
Okay that's not good.

8052
03:54:05,190 --> 03:54:07,250
This team scans us is gonna see we're a full three men by ourselves.

8053
03:54:07,470 --> 03:54:08,870
So just watch out for Bean right now.

8054
03:54:08,950 --> 03:54:09,490
Yeah I'm looking.

8055
03:54:10,270 --> 03:54:12,570
Yeah that's where we're all gonna look and we just gotta shoot on the cross down.

8056
03:54:12,670 --> 03:54:14,470
And then we just get aggressive on the slide down at all.

8057
03:54:14,670 --> 03:54:15,950
The door opened and I'm looking.

8058
03:54:16,670 --> 03:54:17,550
They're redeploying.

8059
03:54:17,570 --> 03:54:18,110
They're redeploying.

8060
03:54:18,690 --> 03:54:19,750
Okay they might just land on us.

8061
03:54:19,790 --> 03:54:19,990
Let's see.

8062
03:54:20,210 --> 03:54:21,050
I can shoot him off.

8063
03:54:21,170 --> 03:54:22,430
I'm gonna try to.

8064
03:54:26,290 --> 03:54:27,310
Oh wait where's that third?

8065
03:54:27,410 --> 03:54:27,530
Oh.

8066
03:54:27,650 --> 03:54:28,770
They're going that way.

8067
03:54:29,230 --> 03:54:30,190
That's so good for us.

8068
03:54:30,230 --> 03:54:32,890
They're gonna go towards that team that was hitting the scan on us.

8069
03:54:32,910 --> 03:54:33,390
Let's get gigantic.

8070
03:54:35,130 --> 03:54:37,690
How is this team playing top of C though and not getting shunted at all?

8071
03:54:38,550 --> 03:54:38,870
They're gamers.

8072
03:54:40,550 --> 03:54:41,270
Yeah just gamers.

8073
03:54:41,410 --> 03:54:42,050
They're just gamers.

8074
03:54:42,270 --> 03:54:42,950
What can they say?

8075
03:54:43,270 --> 03:54:44,310
Yeah I don't know what to say anymore.

8076
03:54:44,610 --> 03:54:46,090
They're just those guys power.

8077
03:54:46,230 --> 03:54:46,450
I don't know.

8078
03:54:47,330 --> 03:54:48,290
We don't have a word for you.

8079
03:54:48,670 --> 03:54:50,390
Do I want to throw another gen down here or no?

8080
03:54:50,890 --> 03:54:51,930
Um yeah I would.

8081
03:54:52,010 --> 03:54:52,950
We're gonna get it back.

8082
03:54:52,950 --> 03:54:55,110
We also have all of the cells too right?

8083
03:54:55,190 --> 03:54:56,770
Yeah I have 8%.

8084
03:54:57,530 --> 03:55:00,030
Oh they're shooting from the... yeah they're shooting from that way.

8085
03:55:00,330 --> 03:55:01,030
They are on bean.

8086
03:55:01,310 --> 03:55:02,690
This team's gonna fight us I think for sure.

8087
03:55:03,670 --> 03:55:04,850
Do we have no more charges?

8088
03:55:05,350 --> 03:55:06,050
Oh yeah we don't.

8089
03:55:06,110 --> 03:55:06,270
Okay.

8090
03:55:06,890 --> 03:55:07,210
No.

8091
03:55:08,050 --> 03:55:09,250
I don't really want to...

8092
03:55:09,250 --> 03:55:09,810
We do.

8093
03:55:09,870 --> 03:55:10,130
We do.

8094
03:55:10,150 --> 03:55:10,290
We do.

8095
03:55:10,770 --> 03:55:11,830
Just throwing it down now.

8096
03:55:11,910 --> 03:55:14,110
I'm gonna control this door and shoot these guys on top bean.

8097
03:55:14,210 --> 03:55:14,410
Alright.

8098
03:55:15,770 --> 03:55:16,510
Watch your back Timber.

8099
03:55:16,990 --> 03:55:17,970
Team 2 was eliminated!

8100
03:55:19,050 --> 03:55:19,370
Nice.

8101
03:55:19,430 --> 03:55:19,830
Okay good.

8102
03:55:19,890 --> 03:55:20,070
Good.

8103
03:55:20,090 --> 03:55:20,390
That's huge.

8104
03:55:20,510 --> 03:55:22,850
That makes me a little bit more confident that the bean team's not gonna fight us.

8105
03:55:22,950 --> 03:55:23,570
What the fuck?

8106
03:55:23,830 --> 03:55:24,690
They're shooting us from the top here.

8107
03:55:24,750 --> 03:55:25,270
Yeah that one.

8108
03:55:26,230 --> 03:55:27,490
That guy's really good bro.

8109
03:55:27,650 --> 03:55:28,350
Everyone's very good.

8110
03:55:28,410 --> 03:55:29,350
Everyone's very good at the game.

8111
03:55:29,590 --> 03:55:30,690
Everyone's very good at this game.

8112
03:55:31,630 --> 03:55:32,670
Everyone's like way ahead of me.

8113
03:55:32,970 --> 03:55:33,290
I'm lucky we got him.

8114
03:55:34,390 --> 03:55:37,110
I want these guys to leave with their horizons so I don't think they're gonna leave.

8115
03:55:38,470 --> 03:55:39,390
Team 17 dead alright?

8116
03:55:39,410 --> 03:55:40,670
We got one point off placement.

8117
03:55:40,970 --> 03:55:42,830
I mean we've already... originally got one point already.

8118
03:55:44,430 --> 03:55:45,290
Show how you're starting.

8119
03:55:45,710 --> 03:55:46,590
I'm like what do you mean?

8120
03:55:46,850 --> 03:55:48,150
Can they play the top of the hill still?

8121
03:55:48,230 --> 03:55:48,410
Yeah.

8122
03:55:48,730 --> 03:55:49,250
Yeah they can.

8123
03:55:49,510 --> 03:55:50,350
Just let me know what they're doing.

8124
03:55:50,390 --> 03:55:50,970
Someone just stared at them.

8125
03:55:51,330 --> 03:55:52,190
I'm staring at them.

8126
03:55:52,950 --> 03:55:53,210
I'm staring at my own bro.

8127
03:55:54,410 --> 03:55:55,270
Where do we go?

8128
03:55:56,070 --> 03:55:57,470
I mean there's a water spot we can play.

8129
03:55:57,530 --> 03:55:58,410
There's over here under the waterfall.

8130
03:55:58,610 --> 03:55:59,050
Yeah we could.

8131
03:55:59,950 --> 03:56:00,230
Yeah.

8132
03:56:00,250 --> 03:56:02,110
I think we might have to go there late but I don't know what these guys are gonna do.

8133
03:56:02,190 --> 03:56:02,370
I don't know.

8134
03:56:02,450 --> 03:56:03,770
They're gonna shoot our fucking Valkylty out.

8135
03:56:04,230 --> 03:56:06,810
Well can they... they can't go the other way.

8136
03:56:07,050 --> 03:56:08,150
They have to go to us.

8137
03:56:08,670 --> 03:56:10,010
Yeah I mean they can evac though.

8138
03:56:11,330 --> 03:56:12,230
Do they have an evac?

8139
03:56:12,870 --> 03:56:13,630
We're gonna do late game.

8140
03:56:13,690 --> 03:56:15,350
We're gonna jump out my side over here.

8141
03:56:15,590 --> 03:56:15,870
Okay?

8142
03:56:16,150 --> 03:56:16,870
Towards over here.

8143
03:56:17,750 --> 03:56:20,330
And we're gonna Valkylty over the back side on this building.

8144
03:56:20,450 --> 03:56:20,550
Okay?

8145
03:56:21,230 --> 03:56:21,730
That's what we're gonna do.

8146
03:56:24,750 --> 03:56:25,910
I'm just gonna wait for the charge.

8147
03:56:26,050 --> 03:56:26,750
I have zero damage.

8148
03:56:27,230 --> 03:56:27,510
Yay!

8149
03:56:28,630 --> 03:56:28,870
That's fine.

8150
03:56:28,870 --> 03:56:30,110
I mean we don't have a choice this time.

8151
03:56:30,110 --> 03:56:32,950
Yeah if I have the time to fucking shoot anything.

8152
03:56:33,750 --> 03:56:35,490
These zones have not been great to us at all.

8153
03:56:35,530 --> 03:56:36,230
They've not been kind.

8154
03:56:37,130 --> 03:56:38,210
Alright you're gonna need a gen though.

8155
03:56:38,510 --> 03:56:39,670
Oh they smoke us or what?

8156
03:56:39,790 --> 03:56:40,270
Can you see?

8157
03:56:40,630 --> 03:56:41,470
I'm gonna scan them.

8158
03:56:41,730 --> 03:56:42,370
Yeah scan them?

8159
03:56:42,430 --> 03:56:42,850
Nice nice nice.

8160
03:56:42,910 --> 03:56:43,250
That's fine.

8161
03:56:46,570 --> 03:56:47,710
Alright so we have two options.

8162
03:56:47,830 --> 03:56:48,610
I'm just gonna keep a lookout.

8163
03:56:48,910 --> 03:56:50,030
I'm gonna try to figure out which option is good.

8164
03:56:50,090 --> 03:56:51,230
Just stay on me when I'm flying okay?

8165
03:56:51,330 --> 03:56:51,790
Yeah yeah yeah.

8166
03:56:52,490 --> 03:56:53,450
They're not dropping down.

8167
03:56:53,450 --> 03:56:55,290
They're just... they have to go soon though.

8168
03:56:55,710 --> 03:56:56,650
Yeah they have to leave.

8169
03:56:56,870 --> 03:57:00,630
Once we see them pop their evac we need to take our Valkylties because they're gonna shoot us out.

8170
03:57:01,590 --> 03:57:02,230
And once we see...

8171
03:57:02,230 --> 03:57:04,190
They're just flying down they're flying down they're flying down!

8172
03:57:04,550 --> 03:57:05,550
I hit one for 80.

8173
03:57:05,690 --> 03:57:06,430
I hit purple 80.

8174
03:57:06,670 --> 03:57:07,430
Can we scan when you can?

8175
03:57:07,470 --> 03:57:07,970
Can we scan when you can?

8176
03:57:08,030 --> 03:57:08,490
Scan scan scan scan.

8177
03:57:09,210 --> 03:57:10,290
Oh no oh oh oh oh.

8178
03:57:10,290 --> 03:57:10,590
Scan scan scan scan.

8179
03:57:10,590 --> 03:57:11,190
Why are they firing off now?

8180
03:57:11,530 --> 03:57:11,950
It's fine.

8181
03:57:12,010 --> 03:57:13,270
Oh my god I'm getting shot from behind.

8182
03:57:13,510 --> 03:57:13,990
It's fine it's fine.

8183
03:57:14,090 --> 03:57:14,650
I'm holding the door.

8184
03:57:14,810 --> 03:57:15,010
Okay.

8185
03:57:17,050 --> 03:57:18,330
I don't scan I don't scan I don't scan.

8186
03:57:18,550 --> 03:57:19,850
One could one one could one one could one.

8187
03:57:19,990 --> 03:57:20,510
I got...

8188
03:57:21,790 --> 03:57:22,650
I full killed I full killed.

8189
03:57:22,930 --> 03:57:23,870
I'm a door I'm a door I'm a door.

8190
03:57:23,930 --> 03:57:24,090
Okay okay.

8191
03:57:24,170 --> 03:57:24,830
Why are you killing us?

8192
03:57:24,890 --> 03:57:25,590
You're so bad at the game.

8193
03:57:25,950 --> 03:57:26,290
We're good.

8194
03:57:26,390 --> 03:57:26,650
I'm medding.

8195
03:57:26,870 --> 03:57:28,030
Play slow we're gonna be dead here though.

8196
03:57:28,130 --> 03:57:29,310
We have to kill these guys we have to kill these guys.

8197
03:57:29,490 --> 03:57:30,910
I'm trying to figure out where they are.

8198
03:57:31,030 --> 03:57:32,130
I'm gonna carry we're gonna run between these guys.

8199
03:57:32,150 --> 03:57:33,110
Okay okay okay I'm here I'm here I'm here.

8200
03:57:33,710 --> 03:57:34,290
Play slow play slow.

8201
03:57:34,450 --> 03:57:36,190
Play slow don't eat the Vagaldee.

8202
03:57:36,710 --> 03:57:37,550
They're nading us now too.

8203
03:57:38,410 --> 03:57:38,650
I'm...

8204
03:57:40,150 --> 03:57:41,810
We have to go we have to go we have to go.

8205
03:57:41,930 --> 03:57:42,750
Go go go go go go go go.

8206
03:57:43,210 --> 03:57:43,830
It's me I'm right side.

8207
03:57:44,270 --> 03:57:44,910
Try to get your kills.

8208
03:57:45,070 --> 03:57:46,030
That's different that's different.

8209
03:57:46,910 --> 03:57:48,030
That's a whole other squad.

8210
03:57:48,030 --> 03:57:49,430
That's a whole other squad.

8211
03:57:49,670 --> 03:57:50,070
What?

8212
03:57:50,930 --> 03:57:52,010
I'm not fighting us bro.

8213
03:57:52,890 --> 03:57:53,790
We got eight though.

8214
03:57:53,910 --> 03:57:54,390
Fucking eight.

8215
03:57:54,790 --> 03:57:56,090
Wait did we get any kills?

8216
03:57:56,310 --> 03:57:57,470
Oh we got one kill.

8217
03:57:57,470 --> 03:57:58,850
Where did they come from?

8218
03:57:59,550 --> 03:58:00,450
This might be possible.

8219
03:58:01,310 --> 03:58:01,990
It might be possible.

8220
03:58:02,090 --> 03:58:02,670
Three points.

8221
03:58:02,770 --> 03:58:05,470
I just cannot believe this team is fighting us bro instead of evacing.

8222
03:58:05,530 --> 03:58:06,070
What are you doing?

8223
03:58:06,270 --> 03:58:07,570
I don't think they had an evac.

8224
03:58:08,130 --> 03:58:08,650
That's not...

8225
03:58:08,650 --> 03:58:10,190
The challenges are against...

8226
03:58:10,190 --> 03:58:12,770
Yeah oh my god my brain hurts a little bit today.

8227
03:58:12,810 --> 03:58:13,890
I think yeah we should...

8228
03:58:13,890 --> 03:58:15,290
We definitely should have left.

8229
03:58:15,590 --> 03:58:16,010
We should have left.

8230
03:58:16,010 --> 03:58:17,550
Yeah we found their ev...

8231
03:58:17,550 --> 03:58:18,570
I don't think they had an evac.

8232
03:58:19,070 --> 03:58:20,610
I don't even know but we played that.

8233
03:58:20,690 --> 03:58:24,250
We actually played that correctly because we just need a valkalde late there and we just get sent on by a stupid team.

8234
03:58:24,410 --> 03:58:27,550
Yeah I think Rezzer was the second team hiding behind us.

8235
03:58:27,750 --> 03:58:29,330
I know I was the top side Seedos team.

8236
03:58:29,410 --> 03:58:30,750
There's no reason for them to do that either.

8237
03:58:30,850 --> 03:58:31,610
That makes no sense.

8238
03:58:31,650 --> 03:58:32,370
They died for it.

8239
03:58:32,690 --> 03:58:33,990
They tied the fight off.

8240
03:58:33,990 --> 03:58:34,150
Yeah.

8241
03:58:36,190 --> 03:58:39,290
I mean this is just my theory that CC is just horrible.

8242
03:58:41,130 --> 03:58:42,570
What do you watch party?

8243
03:58:43,950 --> 03:58:45,990
I mean no final round of CCs guys.

8244
03:58:46,010 --> 03:58:46,590
Yeah but Jesus Christ.

8245
03:58:48,910 --> 03:58:51,810
Too many teams out here thinking they are Aurora or fucking TSM.

8246
03:58:53,750 --> 03:58:55,270
Unfortunate I mean what three points?

8247
03:58:55,390 --> 03:58:56,890
There's a chance like a small chance.

8248
03:58:57,050 --> 03:58:57,490
There's a chance.

8249
03:58:57,930 --> 03:58:58,690
It really depends.

8250
03:58:58,890 --> 03:59:01,930
It sucks that team two actually died though because we needed them to go crazy and kill off the teams.

8251
03:59:03,650 --> 03:59:06,270
It was because they died that teams were still alive.

8252
03:59:06,490 --> 03:59:07,410
I mean we got eight.

8253
03:59:10,390 --> 03:59:11,210
We got point.

8254
03:59:12,490 --> 03:59:12,890
Yeah.

8255
03:59:16,490 --> 03:59:17,830
We'll figure it out here.

8256
03:59:17,910 --> 03:59:18,030
We got point.

8257
03:59:19,110 --> 03:59:19,570
We'll see.

8258
03:59:22,530 --> 03:59:25,730
Damn if we got that Valk ulti off I think we could have played that spot that I wanted to too.

8259
03:59:25,770 --> 03:59:26,070
It sucks.

8260
03:59:26,610 --> 03:59:27,770
So guys it's okay.

8261
03:59:27,870 --> 03:59:36,910
That means that we per- if we don't make it to the next round we purposely threw so that we could play more together.

8262
03:59:37,750 --> 03:59:41,890
And next week we get round three which is not that hard to be improved.

8263
03:59:42,250 --> 03:59:42,610
Yeah.

8264
03:59:42,610 --> 03:59:42,950
Yeah.

8265
03:59:43,050 --> 03:59:43,230
Yeah.

8266
03:59:43,270 --> 03:59:44,970
We get to- Yeah.

8267
03:59:44,970 --> 03:59:55,410
It just means that we just wanted to spend more time together as the besties so we could- Yeah we just love each other that much guys.

8268
03:59:55,530 --> 03:59:57,470
Yeah we just love- and we just wanted Sunday off.

8269
03:59:57,670 --> 03:59:59,010
We loved each other so much.

8270
03:59:59,070 --> 03:59:59,190
Wow.

8271
03:59:59,350 --> 04:00:03,770
We also did not want to stream on Sunday so that's why we purposely threw today.

8272
04:00:04,630 --> 04:00:05,070
Yep.

8273
04:00:05,130 --> 04:00:05,570
Exactly.

8274
04:00:05,790 --> 04:00:07,230
We didn't want to stream tomorrow.

8275
04:00:08,050 --> 04:00:08,490
We're so smart.

8276
04:00:09,350 --> 04:00:10,490
We're so smart guys.

8277
04:00:10,790 --> 04:00:12,750
I think if we didn't get- It's not over yet though.

8278
04:00:12,890 --> 04:00:13,810
I think we still could.

8279
04:00:13,990 --> 04:00:14,870
It's going to be really low.

8280
04:00:14,950 --> 04:00:16,570
I think we have to get fourth place not ninth.

8281
04:00:16,750 --> 04:00:23,450
I think like if we didn't get run at twice in a row that time definitely.

8282
04:00:24,110 --> 04:00:32,070
If we just did not get sent on two times very coincidentally by the best team in the lobby it would probably have been great for us.

8283
04:00:32,070 --> 04:00:34,950
The team we died to is Relax.

8284
04:00:35,450 --> 04:00:39,990
So they're in fourth so this is good that we died to a team that was above us.

8285
04:00:40,170 --> 04:00:40,610
Okay.

8286
04:00:40,710 --> 04:00:40,850
Okay.

8287
04:00:41,790 --> 04:00:43,130
What about the teams alive right now?

8288
04:00:43,170 --> 04:00:43,570
Who's Varded?

8289
04:00:44,950 --> 04:00:46,190
Who's this team that I'm looking at?

8290
04:00:46,330 --> 04:00:46,910
Who's Varden?

8291
04:00:48,170 --> 04:00:48,730
Yeah, yeah.

8292
04:00:48,830 --> 04:00:49,430
They're team four.

8293
04:00:49,750 --> 04:00:50,190
Varden?

8294
04:00:50,330 --> 04:00:50,630
Team 10?

8295
04:00:50,870 --> 04:00:55,390
No, team 10 is- I don't know what that team number is.

8296
04:00:55,490 --> 04:00:58,030
This team just won like 30 kills so hopefully it's a really good team.

8297
04:00:58,590 --> 04:01:00,310
You can see when you open the set.

8298
04:01:03,370 --> 04:01:03,870
Let's see.

8299
04:01:04,850 --> 04:01:06,050
It's their tie in 10.

8300
04:01:06,710 --> 04:01:08,230
And 11 and 12.

8301
04:01:09,870 --> 04:01:10,690
Wait, what happened?

8302
04:01:11,230 --> 04:01:16,270
No, I'm saying we were tied with 10, 11 and 12 before going into this game.

8303
04:01:16,450 --> 04:01:17,070
Oh, so we're tied with 10, 11 and 12.

8304
04:01:17,070 --> 04:01:17,910
That's really scary.

8305
04:01:18,210 --> 04:01:18,810
That's scary.

8306
04:01:26,020 --> 04:01:26,860
Oh man.

8307
04:01:26,960 --> 04:01:27,420
We got 12.

8308
04:01:27,920 --> 04:01:29,560
We were four points away.

8309
04:01:29,940 --> 04:01:30,400
No!

8310
04:01:30,500 --> 04:01:31,800
We were four points.

8311
04:01:31,800 --> 04:01:36,000
If we had two games of just like two more points, we would have been fine.

8312
04:01:36,080 --> 04:01:38,100
We would have just died to those guys three times more.

8313
04:01:38,520 --> 04:01:38,940
Yeah.

8314
04:01:40,380 --> 04:01:42,560
Oh man, it is what it is, guys.

8315
04:01:42,620 --> 04:01:42,940
You know?

8316
04:01:43,060 --> 04:01:43,940
It is what it is.

8317
04:01:44,000 --> 04:01:44,240
GG's.

8318
04:01:44,540 --> 04:01:45,420
GG's everybody.

8319
04:01:46,340 --> 04:01:49,680
Team boys banned from all NA.

8320
04:01:49,680 --> 04:01:50,820
This guy's been a nice wig guy.

8321
04:01:50,840 --> 04:01:51,420
GG's.

8322
04:01:52,440 --> 04:01:52,800
GG's.

8323
04:01:52,800 --> 04:01:53,120
Say it.

8324
04:01:53,120 --> 04:01:53,680
Type that thing.

8325
04:01:53,720 --> 04:01:54,100
Type it.

8326
04:01:54,160 --> 04:01:54,760
No, I typed it.

8327
04:01:54,780 --> 04:01:55,400
I typed that.

8328
04:01:55,480 --> 04:01:56,360
I typed that.

8329
04:01:56,400 --> 04:01:58,340
Those Forelli boy's.

8330
04:01:58,400 --> 04:01:59,120
They're all banned.

8331
04:02:00,000 --> 04:02:01,700
They're banned from all NA events now.

8332
04:02:01,800 --> 04:02:02,720
Oh my god!

8333
04:02:05,360 --> 04:02:06,740
I'm going to be a bad influence.

8334
04:02:06,940 --> 04:02:07,220
I don't know.

8335
04:02:12,720 --> 04:02:14,560
Guys, am I a bad influence?

8336
04:02:14,940 --> 04:02:15,300
Guys?

8337
04:02:15,520 --> 04:02:16,360
Oh yeah, you are.

8338
04:02:16,540 --> 04:02:16,960
I like you.

8339
04:02:17,140 --> 04:02:17,500
Alright.

8340
04:02:17,720 --> 04:02:18,340
GG's, guys.

8341
04:02:18,440 --> 04:02:19,400
You gotta go grab a bite.

8342
04:02:19,640 --> 04:02:20,000
Hey.

8343
04:02:20,000 --> 04:02:20,200
Hey.

8344
04:02:20,200 --> 04:02:20,240
Hey.

8345
04:02:20,420 --> 04:02:20,500
Hey.

8346
04:02:20,500 --> 04:02:20,600
Hey.

8347
04:02:20,600 --> 04:02:20,620
Hey.

8348
04:02:20,620 --> 04:02:20,820
Hey.

8349
04:02:20,820 --> 04:02:22,060
We haven't eaten anything today.

8350
04:02:23,140 --> 04:02:24,440
You can play next week though, actually.

8351
04:02:24,540 --> 04:02:26,340
Yeah, let's do it next week.

8352
04:02:26,600 --> 04:02:26,800
I'm in.

8353
04:02:28,780 --> 04:02:30,080
You practiced this week?

8354
04:02:30,260 --> 04:02:34,180
And then on top of that all, we figured out a comp that's good for us as well.

8355
04:02:34,280 --> 04:02:35,000
We'll figure that out too.

8356
04:02:35,340 --> 04:02:38,560
It was a feeler.

8357
04:02:38,560 --> 04:02:39,220
It was a feeler week.

8358
04:02:39,400 --> 04:02:41,240
Yeah, we were just figuring stuff out.

8359
04:02:42,860 --> 04:02:43,220
Exactly.

8360
04:02:43,220 --> 04:02:43,960
You get it.

8361
04:02:44,040 --> 04:02:45,740
You know what?

8362
04:02:46,560 --> 04:02:48,500
I'm glad I didn't have to play six hours.

8363
04:02:51,180 --> 04:02:51,780
I know.

8364
04:02:51,820 --> 04:02:53,360
I'm actually kind of glad too.

8365
04:02:53,460 --> 04:02:53,880
Yeah.

8366
04:02:55,980 --> 04:02:56,620
Don't worry.

8367
04:02:56,700 --> 04:02:58,040
I'll be locked in next week.

8368
04:02:58,100 --> 04:03:01,200
Next week I'll be locked in for six hours.

8369
04:03:01,440 --> 04:03:01,900
Yeah, same.

8370
04:03:01,900 --> 04:03:01,900
Same.

8371
04:03:01,900 --> 04:03:01,900
Same.

8372
04:03:01,900 --> 04:03:02,920
I still feel around guys.

8373
04:03:02,940 --> 04:03:04,680
Yeah, we're just feeling it out.

8374
04:03:04,840 --> 04:03:06,540
We didn't know how it was going to be.

8375
04:03:06,760 --> 04:03:11,480
Also, someone make my Liquipedia now because I went and...

8376
04:03:11,480 --> 04:03:14,360
That was an official tournament.

8377
04:03:15,180 --> 04:03:16,220
Liquipedia immediately.

8378
04:03:16,580 --> 04:03:18,580
Yeah, I want my Liquipedia now.

8379
04:03:18,720 --> 04:03:21,580
And the person that keeps removing it is removing my Liquipedia.

8380
04:03:21,760 --> 04:03:24,680
You can't remove it anymore because Challenge Circus is legit.

8381
04:03:26,400 --> 04:03:27,360
Yeah, exactly.

8382
04:03:27,640 --> 04:03:28,200
We're mad legit.

8383
04:03:28,200 --> 04:03:29,660
Okay guys, I gotta head out for dinner.

8384
04:03:30,920 --> 04:03:31,540
GG's guys.

8385
04:03:31,880 --> 04:03:34,220
We run it back next week.

8386
04:03:34,220 --> 04:03:34,580
Next week.

8387
04:03:34,580 --> 04:03:35,020
Next week.

8388
04:03:35,020 --> 04:03:37,280
Is that the one on the 13th?

8389
04:03:37,520 --> 04:03:38,260
I think so.

8390
04:03:40,300 --> 04:03:41,220
13, 14...

8391
04:03:41,220 --> 04:03:44,040
I should be able to play 100%.

8392
04:03:44,040 --> 04:03:45,180
I'm 100% sure I can.

8393
04:03:45,820 --> 04:03:47,180
Let us know.

8394
04:03:47,800 --> 04:03:48,560
GG's guys.

8395
04:03:48,920 --> 04:03:49,280
I have a lot of time.

8396
04:03:50,820 --> 04:03:51,160
Bye.

8397
04:03:51,160 --> 04:03:54,680
Listen, don't call it a comeback because we never left guys.

8398
04:03:54,840 --> 04:03:55,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8399
04:03:55,920 --> 04:04:00,080
We exceeded our expectations because I didn't think we were going to get past round one.

8400
04:04:00,320 --> 04:04:01,040
I'm with you as well.

8401
04:04:01,160 --> 04:04:01,720
I'm the same thing.

8402
04:04:03,460 --> 04:04:04,920
So we exceeded expectations.

8403
04:04:06,460 --> 04:04:06,820
Alright.

8404
04:04:07,020 --> 04:04:07,820
Well, GG's guys.

8405
04:04:07,880 --> 04:04:08,300
Love y'all man.

8406
04:04:08,900 --> 04:04:09,540
GG's everybody.

8407
04:04:09,960 --> 04:04:10,320
Bye bye.

8408
04:04:10,600 --> 04:04:10,960
Bye.

8409
04:04:13,540 --> 04:04:14,420
That was fun.

8410
04:04:14,640 --> 04:04:15,620
10 minutes chat.

8411
04:04:17,240 --> 04:04:18,880
Will you guys see this in 10 minutes?

8412
04:04:20,040 --> 04:04:21,580
You know, it's a blessing in disguise.

8413
04:04:21,700 --> 04:04:23,820
Because I can actually rest.

8414
04:04:26,160 --> 04:04:28,960
It's secretly a blessing in disguise for me.

8415
04:04:31,020 --> 04:04:32,500
But GG's everybody.

8416
04:04:32,880 --> 04:04:34,100
I honestly...

8417
04:04:34,100 --> 04:04:35,840
I had a...

8418
04:04:36,560 --> 04:04:37,820
I had a great time.

8419
04:04:38,540 --> 04:04:40,200
Playing with Wig and Tempo.

8420
04:04:40,640 --> 04:04:45,080
And we're going to see if we'll all be doing it next week.

8421
04:04:45,120 --> 04:04:45,700
We'll see.

8422
04:04:46,480 --> 04:04:48,280
But as always everybody.

8423
04:04:48,680 --> 04:04:49,820
Stay hydrated.

8424
04:04:50,120 --> 04:04:50,660
Posture check.

8425
04:04:50,820 --> 04:04:52,280
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

8426
04:04:52,400 --> 04:04:54,040
And if you're suffering, head to bed.

8427
04:04:54,140 --> 04:04:55,020
Because you deserve it.

8428
04:04:55,120 --> 04:04:56,960
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

8429
04:04:57,700 --> 04:04:58,360
Bye guys.

8430
04:04:58,840 --> 04:04:59,200
Bye.

8431
04:04:59,440 --> 04:05:01,140
I hope I do the fucking...

8432
04:05:01,140 --> 04:05:02,760
The delay thing always fucks me up.

8433
04:05:02,800 --> 04:05:04,440
I don't know how to do it properly.

8434
04:05:04,640 --> 04:05:06,040
Like ending this delay stuff.

8435
04:05:06,260 --> 04:05:09,180
But I hope I don't accidentally end it in the middle of the game.

8436
04:05:09,280 --> 04:05:10,280
