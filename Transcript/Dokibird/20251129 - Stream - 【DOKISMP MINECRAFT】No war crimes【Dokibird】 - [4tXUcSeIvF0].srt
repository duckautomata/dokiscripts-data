1
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:55,280
one hello hello sorry i had i um i used the bathroom i was
like i was like i'm ready and then i was like wait i got it

2
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:05,140
i got used to bathroom brb also so you know like those
moments when um um when you're eating some i i had lunch

3
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,820
earlier and then i had something stuck on my in my in my 10
minutes trying to get it out.

4
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,260
Oh, I hate that feeling so much.

5
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,880
And I got so paranoid because I was trying to use my tongue
to, um, get whatever the fuck that was, like the, the,

6
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,280
whatever food was in my tooth or like my gums.

7
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:31,140
And then, um, and then like I got so paranoid because I was
like, oh, wait, my tongue keeps like rubbing that tooth.

8
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,980
Will it make my tooth worse?

9
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,360
And then I yeah, yeah, yeah.

10
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,700
So I got really paranoid.

11
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,140
So I was in like this Google rep.

12
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,280
It was like five And it's like five minutes till the stream.

13
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Let me look this up to make sure I'm not fucking mickey.

14
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,520
And I found out apparently if you use your tongue to like
rub against your tooth too much, you can cause teeth

15
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,080
erosion.

16
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,580
And I was like, oh no.

17
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,820
And then it caused me to keep rubbing my tongue against the
tooth because that's all I could think about.

18
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,540
I was just like, oh my God, I need to stop doing it.

19
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,960
And I'm still like rubbing my tongue against it.

20
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,100
I was like, wait, no.

21
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:21,000
I did it's like no stop and then yeah yeah apparently it's
real like you can cause erosion on your tooth um if you keep

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,120
rubbing your tongue against it and I was just like oh no
it's like don't think about breathing and then you're like

23
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:36,220
now now I'm like periodically rubbing against it I'm like no
it's eroding my teeth I'm like freaking out anyway that's

24
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:47,600

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,860
I know some people have it on the roof of their mouths, but
mine's at the bottom.

56
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,080
And then now everybody's going to be thinking about it.

Wait, where is this?

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,740
Captured ghosts from...

76
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,220

78
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Are any of my Minecraft?

79
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

80
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,520
Okay, there you go.

Minecraft mod!

82
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,480
White list el mexicant.

83
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,000
So only he can be allowed in the server.

84
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,120
Just only let him...

85
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,560
him in the server.

86
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,540
No one else.

87
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,600
Just let him log in.

88
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,140
Why list that man right now?

89
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,620
That dear.

90
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,380
Is he even online?

91
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,520
I don't know.

92
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,720
I don't working on as evil.

93
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,740
I'm gonna explore the server but make sure he's in that
prison cell.

94
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,180
Oh yeah, for those who don't know, this is my prison cell.

95
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,820
So anyone that...

96
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,840
I would kidnap one tribute.

97
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,220
I'll hold one hostage from each land.

98
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,680
It's like the Hunger Games, where each land sends me their
tribute.

99
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,860
But instead of sending it to me, I kidnap one.

100
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:58,720
So to make sure they don't piss me off, I kidnap all their
most prized possessions or pets.

101
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,660
And make sure that they don't fuck with anyone.

102
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,980
No one can fuck with me.

103
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:13,680
uh yeah it's that's that yeah it's a sacrifice to make sure
nobody does anything bad in my server uh yeah it's like

104
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,420
they're technically volunteers volunteers from each area so
um i know it says captured but that's like a typo it should

105
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,860
be like volunteered cat from shopping district uh
volunteered horse from shopping district volunteer ghost

106
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,720
from mexico and jerk gas from Mexico and Germany.

107
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,040
Volunteered player from the void.

108
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,840
An order from our president and queen and king and emperor.

109
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,040
Volunteered horse from the volunteer player.

110
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,480
You consider freeing the animals at you.

111
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,780
They volunteered themselves to be here, Lafayette.

112
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,720

113
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,680

in, is he not here?

116
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:25,240
Okay, Dragoon um admin, admin, let one person in to the
server who would be a substitute for our humble volunteer

117
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:33,920

their 9 to 5 He didn't show up for his shift.

118
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,180

122
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,140
Open the raindrop gates.

That should be a bit better.

342
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,910
Okay, and then 12 chunks.

343
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,410
Okay.

344
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,710
Is that better?

345
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,590
No, I must have...

346
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,290
That's weird.

347
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,540
Let's see.

348
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,760
We'll fix this.

349
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,300
It kind of improved.

350
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,380
It's literally not any.

351
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,180
It kind of improved a bit.

352
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,960
But what is my...

353
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,590
No, that's weird.

354
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,130
Because, like, my CPU and memory are okay.

355
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:06,890
Oh, wait.

356
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,670
I'm okay now.

357
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,330
There you go.

358
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,430
Oh, I'm not okay.

359
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,150
I tap back in and I'm no longer okay.

360
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,530
Wait, what's this?

361
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,770
Oh, that was the thumb.

362
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,750
Try shift F3.

363
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,730
Once you're tabbed in.

364
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,870
Yeah, once I'm tabbed in, it's not okay anymore.

365
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,470
Why is that?

366
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,570
Maybe I should do...

367
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:39,890
240?

368
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,190
Maybe that would help.

369
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,130
Oh, no.

370
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,890
Oh, no.

371
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,770
I made it worse.

372
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,970
I made it worse.

373
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,670
We're just stuck at putting it back.

374
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,480
Turn it off full screen.

375
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,840
You think it's the full...

376
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,360
Oh, wait.

377
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,300
Oh, there we go.

378
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,260
It's back to normal.

379
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,260
Okay, there we go.

380
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,520

00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,090
Make sure you get rid of their TP rights.

00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,260

00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:52,080
Let them in and place them in here and restrict all of them.

I got to have builders for my eye of Doki.

498
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,040
Make sure they're all in this particular spot, too.

499
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,280
All right, slowly TP them in here, and then restrict them.

500
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,170
All right.

501
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,470
Make sure you put them right here.

Are they all locked up?

695
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,270
Make sure they can never escape.

696
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:19,190
Wait, he got out.

697
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,110

00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:21,310
I'm taking her.

700
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,510

Yeah, we had a lot of people die, unfortunately.

01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:21,430
we had we might have had a lot of people die during the
building just like just like the real iosura we might have

You're so sad.

888

Why do you look so sad?

889
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:58,180
Is it because you're locked in here?

890
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,000
Why are y'all so sad?

891
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,880

You goddamn coward.

898
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,020
Even when being cased in the water prison.

899
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:34,630
Oh, my God.

900
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,430
It's beautiful.

901
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:36,330
The eye.

902
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:38,090
The eye of Doki.

903
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:38,450
Oh, wait.

904
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,310

Wait.

906
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:41,310
What did he got?

907
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,150
He got bad.

908
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,210
Look at that.

909
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,070
It's beautiful.

910
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:53,650
I would have liked it to be a little taller, but we'll
figure, we'll do that later.

911
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:54,890
Don't worry.

912
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,950
That's for offstream, uh, offstream volunteers.

913
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:00,930
I believe.

914
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,250
Oh my god.

915
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,010
They're like actually constructing stuff.

916
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:07,690
Look at them.

917
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,250
Look at them go.

He tried to break in.

924
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,380
I saw him try to do a prison break.

925
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,440
No prison breaks allowed.

926
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,800
No, he tried to do a prison break here.

927
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:34,620

There's a tired world.

945
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:57,690
It's just flowers.

946
01:08:58,370 --> 01:08:59,850

Don't let Lafey out.

951
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,080
They ruined it.

952
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:13,600
Okay.

953
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,840
Oh, oh my God.

954
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:22,580
I like how, I like how there's sheep surrounding his animals
around here.

955
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,780
That is crazy.

956
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,340
That is actually crazy.

957
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,720
Oh my God.

958
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,200
That is beautiful.

959
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,720
And it's moving too.

960
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:39,860
Oh my god.

961
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,300
The amount of time to build that.

962
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,160
The fact that someone made a twerk is crazy.

963
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:45,900
Why was this?

964
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,160
Fan fix.

965
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,440
Oh hey, it has my hair.

966
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,360
What are the fan fix here?

967
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:57,860
Alright.

968
01:09:58,540 --> 01:09:59,980
Oh, it's Germany!

969
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,080
They still have my...

970
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:03,600
Oh, they're here.

971
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,680
There's my bedrock right here.

01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:15,150
Laughing, thank you, thank you, thank you.

973
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,810
I built the beacon.

974
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:18,270
I did more than you.

975
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:22,170
The beacon wasn't part of the eye of Doki.

976
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:23,410
What do you mean?

977
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,050
You both fucked up.

978
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:28,250
Your entire group fucked up.

979
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:30,370
Oh yeah, there's the headquarters.

980
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,060

981
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,140

01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:16,880
Yeah, you did.

986
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,260
I'm not that evil.

987
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,860
Oh, look at that!

988
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,520
Is it almost done?

989
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,020
What else?

990
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:28,480
You guys have...

991
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:34,520
Okay, it's a little lopsided, but you know, it's already a
huge improvement from before.

992
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,480
It's okay.

993
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:40,000
It's okay.

994
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,180
You guys did a lot better than the other group.

995
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:48,780
I already I'll give you guys that You guys already did a lot
better From the other group It is a little lopsided but

996
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,140
that's okay

997
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,140
What a bum Wait what are they trying to do now?

998
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,820
Oh they met What are they trying to do?

999
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,800
Is it done?

1000
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,260
Are you guys done?

1001
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,900
Is the group Done?

1002
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:23,360
I need to know what else are they no what is what is left
not you i'm not talking about the old group i'm talking

1003
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:36,240
about the new group i you guys can't talk for them oh yeah
we lost a lot of the workers uh

1004
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,320
i'm talking to the new group if they're done or not

1005
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:53,920
I didn't ask for their opinion.

1006
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,680
I asked for the new group's opinion.

1007
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,390
I think we should make it skinnier.

1008
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:03,770
We just didn't get it.

1009
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,090
What do you mean?

1010
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:12,110
They had the new group had the same amount of instructions
as the old group.

1011
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:20,630
Yet somehow they were actually able to build the eye of
Doki.

1012
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:31,510
I believe they had the same amount of instructions.

1013
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,210
This is just a prototype.

1014
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:36,490
This is a pretty good prototype.

1015
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:37,190
You know what?

1016
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:38,690
This is pretty good.

1017
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:40,150
I...

1018
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,650
This is really good.

1019
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:47,990
For five people, we used to have more, but they sort of died
during the building of this.

1020
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:50,670
But...

1021
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:53,310
But yeah, literally skillet.

1022
01:13:53,330 --> 01:14:03,030
issue for their skill issue from this group to the old group
i would say that these people these people in the new group

1023
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:10,850
were able to construct an adequate eye of doki for me look

1338
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,940

1339
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,040
Keep El Mexicon in that jail.

1340
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:34,900

Put him in the water chamber.

1346
