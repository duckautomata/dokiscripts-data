1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,280
Thank you so, so much for joining us today.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,080
It's been a great convention so far.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,020
How many of you have been to at least one or other event here this weekend?

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,420
Hope you all have been having a great time when we have one more fantastic panel.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,800
Please, give it up for Doki Bird!

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,740
So nice to see all you guys.

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,540
Oh my gosh, you must be really, really busy right now.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,760
There's so many fun events and so many stuff to buy.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,180
I was talking to a drag owner who spent around $3,000 on a chair.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,520
That's crazy.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,640
That's why I'm calling you up, buddy.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,200
Hey!

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,800
Hey!

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,660
Yeah, we're having a great time.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,940
I was roaming around the vendors slash artists.

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,240
It was like an hour or two ago.

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,860
I didn't even finish it.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,180
Apparently, one of my staff told me there was like around a hundred plus booths that's just selling Doki merch.

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,560
And I was like, what?

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,900
We already maxed out one credit card.

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,800
Oh my God!

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,580
And so we got like to put these two of our staff's credit cards to buy my door.

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,520
It was crazy.

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,920
All business expenses.

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,200
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,600
All business expenses.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:42,860
Yeah.

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,140
I even bought like, there was apparently like this drag room plushie that was not for sale.

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
And I was like, I want it.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't care.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,660
Oh, it's just the staff up from the factory.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,100
I was like, I don't care.

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,340
I want it so no other drag room can have it.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,820
I don't care.

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:01:59,840
I don't care.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,620
Every time.

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,300
That's right.

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Ah, patient zero.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,480
I'm good at drag room plushie.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,120
Yeah, apparently today, there's gonna be a little Q&A.

41
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,680
So you drag rooms can ask me some questions.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Any questions that you've always wanted to ask me.

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,840
It's like a little Vectagon stream here.

44
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,720
I'm super excited to talk to all of you guys.

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,600
Woo!

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,220
I'm just walking around and getting some questions.

47
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,100
So, I guess, while I get in position, I will ask the first one.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,680
What is the most unexpected piece of work that you found in Wendell?

49
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,800
Oh, in UpKai?

50
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,420
Hmm.

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,100
Oh, I, oh, uh, uh, who was it?

52
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:51,460
Uh, I don't think there's that many boosts today, because, like, I think we only had, like, an hour and a half, and we only wasn't able to get, like, we only got, like, 20 boosts in.

53
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,820
But, out of those 20 boosts, I think the most unexpected one was a bottle opener.

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,200
A bottle opener!

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,020
And I was like, oh, man, I've never seen that before, you know, like, a VTuber bottle opener?

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,120
Uh, think finally I can open my bottles more conveniently.

57
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:18,420
I was like, yeah, I got that this year, but I think that one was the, uh, most, uh, uh, unexpected merch that I found at UpKai.

58
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:25,360
I think another unexpected merch that I saw on Twitter was, was the deodorant.

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,360
I heard the mid-deodorant got sold right now on the first day.

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,180
Yup, yup.

61
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,000
I thought that was, I thought that was really funny.

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,540
Uh, but yeah, those are the two of the most unexpected merch I've seen.

63
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,900
All right, who else has got a question?

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,360
Yeah, who wants to start with a meeting in there?

65
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,820
Hi!

66
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,000
Hi, Doki!

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:53,920
Hi, Doki!

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,480
There you go.

69
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,280
Hi!

70
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:56,960
Hi, Doki!

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Yeah, everyone!

72
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,220
So, I'm going to ask the same question.

73
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,860
Hey, when are we getting renamed to Neskos?

74
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,240
Never.

75
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,820
Also, I like that there's like two minions in that.

76
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,060
How about over here?

77
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,860
Hello.

78
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,440
Hello, hello.

79
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,580
My name is Rune, and I love your new summer costume.

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you!

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,740
What is your favorite summer activity?

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,220
What is my favorite summer activity?

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,280
Oh, that's difficult because I hate the ocean.

84
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,340
I actually, okay, I know we all like, oh my gosh, the beach episode.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,920
But I actually really hate the beach.

86
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,440
Because, you know, like, sand gets into everywhere and it's disgusting.

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,900
And also, like, I don't like the ocean because I always see it as, like, the nature's toilet.

88
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,400
Because, you know, the fish are there and then the other types of sea animals are there.

89
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
And, you know, where do they go?

90
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,160
And they need to use the bathroom.

91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,240
In the ocean.

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,340
And then we go in the ocean and we, you know, open our mouths.

93
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,700
I haven't been to the beach for a while.

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,940
But, like, if I had to pick my favorite summer activity at the beach, it would be like, I don't know.

95
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:39,100
I guess, like, eating watermelon or ice cream, like, that seems like the most least harmful thing you can do on the beach.

96
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,780
And definitely on, like, a patio or something, so I'm gonna have to touch the grass.

97
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,980
That's my favorite each activity.

98
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,560
Alright, I have one right up here.

99
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,640
Hello, Doki.

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,020
My name is Jimbo.

101
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,560
So, I'm a fellow Apex player as well.

102
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,620
So, I just reached out to the end of the season.

103
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,600
Anyway, I'm not that good at trash talking.

104
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:18,560
So, is there any advice for you, as a new trash talker, to learn trash talking in Apex Alton?

105
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,400
Especially when I'm still looking at you.

106
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,340
It's really challenging anyone to help me tossing.

107
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,380
Like, I don't know.

108
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,560
It's really difficult to be toxic these days because, like, you can get recorded and then they'll mute your account.

109
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,320
I remember, like, I saw, like, a tweet from someone who was trying to trash talk in Overwatch.

110
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,560
And all they said was, like, they said, all they said was, like, swap off this character.

111
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,100
You're bad at it.

112
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,560
And then their account got muted.

113
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,460
It took two months.

114
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
So, I was like, honest.

115
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,420
That's why I trash talk to you guys about people.

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,940
Because, like, what are they gonna do?

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,900
Clip me?

118
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,680
And they're trying to ban me off on my street?

119
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,680
We can't do that.

120
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,860
Like...

121
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,130
But...

122
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,920
And you really want to test the wires.

123
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,700
Like, test to see if we respond.

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,980
Who's gonna look through the reports or anything.

125
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,780
Um...

126
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,090
Usually...

127
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,460
Okay, I...

128
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:15,940
I...

129
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,900
Yes, I don't...

130
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,460
I'm...

131
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,540
I'm only toxic internally in my head to people.

132
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,620
But...

133
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,540
I would be like...

134
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,980
I would be like, do you have ads?

135
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,960
Like...

136
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,400
I think...

137
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,280
Oh...

138
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,120
Or, like, uninst...

139
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,120
No, you should just uninstall, like...

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,720
Like...

141
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,360
That's like the easiest thing to say, to be like, Oh, man.

142
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,480
You might as well uninstall.

143
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,440
It's like...

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,720
This game's not for you.

145
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,620
But, like, if you really want to be, like...

146
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,340
You can be passive-aggressive and your count won't be bad.

147
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,680
Because when you look through the course, you'll be like, oh, look, he's just trying to be encouraging.

148
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,780
So this is something that I learned from one of my friends, Surefour, because he would do this the whole time to me.

149
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,800
He was like, good job, guys, and then he would give a smile.

150
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,680
You guys are doing that to me.

151
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,040
And then I'm like, hey, everybody, keep yourself safe.

152
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,180
Stop, stop, stop.

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,400
Or like, you should really keep yourself safe.

154
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,380
So I'm like, yeah, yeah, we can't batten you for that.

155
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,140
I'm like, oh, you won't have to be safe.

156
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,920
That's nice, but then when you think about it, what are the initials of keep yourself safe?

157
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,280
And I'm afraid it's not been bad for me for saying stuff like this.

158
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Like, those are like easy tips to get past the report system.

159
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,100
Yeah.

160
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
That was your part.

161
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:52,920
Yeah.

162
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,140
I know.

163
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,840
Hi, Dougie.

164
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,940
Hey.

165
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,880
My name is Inu.

166
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,820
I wanted to say a quick question.

167
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,520
In a much more purple age, you used my art for one of your birthdays.

168
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,580
And at the last time, VTuber linked my stuff in their screen.

169
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,020
So from the bottom of my heart, thank you for that.

170
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:20,960
My main question was, I'll have like a Marvel rival stream at like 3 AM.

171
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:27,120
And I know that you always have your usual Doki amount of energy.

172
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:38,180
So what is your usual like routine or mental gymnastics that keep you from just passing out mid-string while trying to pop a little hole?

173
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:48,500
Okay, like for me when it comes to like competitive games, I actually like, my entire body runs off of the pure adrenaline of competitiveness.

174
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,500
That's why like, for me, I always tell people I cannot do a 24 hour stream.

175
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,880
Like, I remember trying to do a 24 hour stream a long, long time ago.

176
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,720
Like before they, during like retro era Doki.

177
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,900
And then like, cause it was like a cherry to go back then during retro Doki era.

178
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,620
And, um, I mean, I gave up after 12 hours cause I was like, I can't guys.

179
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,980
Like, I don't have the energy for this.

180
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,420
But if I had to, if I could, if I could just play competitive stuff.

181
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,920
Obviously you guys know I've done like a 16 hour, like Marvel Rivals just ranked, right?

182
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,280
And that was because it was all just pure adrenaline of playing ranked.

183
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,160
Um, because I just like to see the numbers go up.

184
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,660
Like, or I'm due to it.

185
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,560
It's one or the other.

186
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,880
You know, he was like, you can't end on a loss.

187
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,800
And you can't end on a, you can't break your win streak, you know?

188
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:42,780
Um, but, uh, basically for me, it's just, after stream, I'm like, I don't exist as a person.

189
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,900
I'm like, I'm running on like power save mode.

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,560
So like, sometimes after stream, I just be like, I'm like, I'm not like a sentient being when the stream's over.

191
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,440
Like, I literally just like, it's like recharged, like blanked out, disassociated on my bed.

192
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,380
And I'm like, okay, I'll, I'll get up after I become a person.

193
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,080
That's basically how I, I don't think that's healthy, to be fair.

194
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,240
That's not healthy.

195
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,440
And so, so learn from me, yeah, that's not that healthy.

196
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:25,880
But, um, but for me, if I use too much energy during the stream, that's basically, I just like, recharge, I take like one to two hours of just not existing to recharge myself.

197
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,140
Hi, Doki, it's, uh, Osnia again.

198
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,060
I wanted to ask a question that I didn't have time to ask during the free.

199
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,700
Um, so you said that you, uh, haven't gone through all of the Artist Alley.

200
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,460
Uh, have you had time to go through your bio?

201
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:55,080
I'll just say, I'll just say, cause I know like, during, when I was at Fatimae, they also had something similar.

202
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,020
They had like an R18 Artist Alley there.

203
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,660
I just said my staff member, like, hi!

204
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:09,080
I mean like, alright, staff member, you, you go explore the R18 section and just let me know if there's any Doki merch.

205
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,740
But like, I, I, I, I have not run through like a bio market.

206
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,720
I know there's Doki stuff in there.

207
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,240
But I, I don't know if today there's, there's a bio market today.

208
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,420
But, if there is, my staff member will, will walk through it.

209
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,980
I won't be there.

210
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,620
I, I know there's things that my eyes shouldn't be seeing.

211
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,940
We have a, it's pretty very important update over here.

212
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,700
Uh, hi Doki.

213
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,100
Uh, I'm Hadoon.

214
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:47,020
And, uh, a piece of, uh, this content that just always brings a spark to my life.

215
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,640
Uh, we get, uh, Off Tye exclusive, uh, dad update.

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,780
I don't know what he's doing!

217
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,900
Okay, okay.

218
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,820
Lately, he's been an asshole.

219
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,680
I have no idea why.

220
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,640
He's actually been a terrorizer.

221
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,540
So if another dog has interest in him, they go up to him, and he baits them too.

222
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:24,340
Like, you know, he lets them come close, but then when they get close to him, he'd just be like...

223
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,720
And then he scares them away, and I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?

224
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,660
I'm like, why are you baiting them?

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,480
He just told them to get off early on.

226
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,080
Why are you making them think that you guys are best friends?

227
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,340
And then proceeds to harass them.

228
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,920
Also, he really, really hates children.

229
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,580
He sees them as, like, a dog that's bigger than him.

230
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,400
Because he hates dogs that are taller than him.

231
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,120
Which is the majority of the dogs.

232
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,520
Look at these, like, goddamn weird dogs.

233
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,560
So, yesterday, I was trying to take him back from a walk.

234
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,660
And then there was a bunch of kids just running from the hallway, and he didn't like that.

235
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,580
He was like, what are you doing?

236
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,520
I was like, stop running in the halls!

237
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,020
How dare you!

238
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,760
Like, he just doesn't, I don't know, he just doesn't like children.

239
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,540
He just sees them as, like, bigger dogs.

240
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,400
And he feels frightened by it.

241
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,440
So, I've been a big fan since your debut.

242
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,740
I've really liked your music.

243
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,380
And I wanted to know if you had any new music coming out.

244
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,740
Oh!

245
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,240
I mean, there is a concert next month.

246
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,080
That's all I can say.

247
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,680
There is a concert next month.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,240
So, maybe...

249
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,740
Class of class.

250
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,420
Edna's working right here.

251
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,500
Hey, Debbie.

252
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,760
Hello!

253
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,680
A long time ago, in the before times, I remember when you streamed after getting with the kids removed.

254
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,260
And I'm wondering if you have any recollection of that, or if you ever listened back to your own recordings.

255
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,960
Technically, okay, so I remember I did like a, what was it called, a Twitter Space.

256
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,580
Technically, I wasn't allowed to do a Twitter Space.

257
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,780
Technically, I wasn't allowed to do a Twitter Space back then.

258
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:41,060
But I think it's because, like, obviously I had my wisdom teeth removed, so I didn't...

259
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,720
Like, I didn't remember or cared about that.

260
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,620
But I think, like... I think, like...

261
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,260
Um... I just remembered I didn't get, like, reprimanded for it.

262
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,080
Because, like, I don't know, maybe they just didn't know I did do a Twitter Space back then.

263
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:57,960
Uh...

264
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,180
But, uh...

265
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,160
Honestly, I don't remember what I said during that.

266
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,580
I just remembered, I was like, oh shit, wait, I'm not supposed to do a Twitter Space after, like, the post-wism teeth surgery.

267
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,040
Um...

268
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,120
But I have no idea what I said during that stream.

269
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,960
It's, like, lost archives.

270
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,520
Uh, hey, Doki.

271
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,060
It's good seeing you.

272
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,020
Uh, before I get to my question, I just want to say congratulations on the sex with me last year.

273
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:45,480
I know you're a huge fan of Dynasty Warriors, the series, and the whole Romantic Three Kingdom though, right?

274
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,440
Yeah.

275
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:59,020
I have a question with that is, out of all the dialogue and lines in the game, do you think of one that you can find that you can say to men about how much you like her?

276
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,680
Do you have a question?

277
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,520
Is that all the lines...

278
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,260
I mean, I can't.

279
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:16,160
Um, the only thing I can remember, if you want me to quote a line from Dynasty Warriors, is, Do not pursue nooboo.

280
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,940
That'll be my line.

281
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,480
Do not pursue nooboo.

282
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,820
Hello.

283
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,180
Hello.

284
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,220
How are you doing?

285
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,620
I'm doing great.

286
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:41,940
So, as one of the founding members of TSB, who is the best girl out of Regis and Axel?

287
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,500
Who is the best bro?

288
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,300
I feel like I'd be the best bro.

289
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,060
I feel like I'm the most bro out of all the bro-tubers out there.

290
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,960
I'm an OG bro-tuber.

291
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,320
I remember when we asked that question for Axel, he was like, hell no.

292
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,140
He wouldn't even do it.

293
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,680
Like, that's fucked up.

294
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,140
That's not bro-behavior.

295
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,740
Wait, so if you're the bro...

296
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,000
Like, you just let your bro die like that?

297
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,540
No one will know.

298
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,380
Like, only you and your bro will know.

299
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,360
He'll die like that.

300
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,600
Hi, Doki.

301
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,640
Hey!

302
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm Virgil.

303
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,500
Uh...

304
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,940
Normal Phantom Deep fan.

305
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,840
Very normal.

306
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,860
And, uh...

307
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,820
What are the odds that you would play Silent Hill F?

308
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,980
If you meant that you would- No.

309
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,100
If you meant that you would- No.

310
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,180
I think that I'll chill.

311
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,840
I would say...

312
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,060
I would- I did say that I'll only play Silent Hill F if I ever hit a million subscribers.

313
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,420
That is like my only thing that I'll only do Silent Hill F.

314
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:12,920
I played Silent Hill Remastered or two, and that shit was actually- Like, I was so scared.

315
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,160
Like, I could only play two hours mass every playthrough.

316
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,940
So it was- it was- it was that bad.

317
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:27,240
Like, if I had a heart monitor, my heart- I think you would have to call a doctor if you can- You know, like, if you saw, like, where my heartbeat was going.

318
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,680
Like, people would be like- Wait, that's not- I don't think- Wait a minute.

319
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,740
I think we actually have to call the- The hospital for hair.

320
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,340
Um, but I'll only do it if I ever hit a million subscribers.

321
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,040
Like, I am not- I'm not willingly doing that.

322
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,000
Or I can bribe.

323
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,600
I'll do anything for money.

324
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,240
How much?

325
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:46,900
Woo!

326
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:47,760
Woo!

327
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,360
Five dollars!

328
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,060
Thank you!

329
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,570
Hey, Dougie.

330
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,190
Hello!

331
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:54,890
Hello!

332
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,630
I'm gonna say, uh, four weeks earlier.

333
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,010
And, uh, what's your favorite Project Sekai group?

334
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,850
Do you need one more jump, Vivid Bad Squad, Wonderland, or Night Court?

335
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,010
Oh, I think- Oh, I love- I think Wonderland's pretty cute.

336
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,830
To be fair, I don't know that much about Project Sekai.

337
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,230
I remember Wonderland because you're based off of that amusement park, and I thought they were all so cute.

338
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:24,090
But, um, I'm not a rhythm gamer, so, like, obviously I have a huge lack of, uh, knowledge of rhythm games.

339
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:31,390
It's because I lack rhythm, so I don't, you know, I don't wanna, like, I don't like playing- I personally don't like playing games I'm bad at.

340
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,030
That's why you don't have to see me play Valor.

341
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,250
Because I'm bad at tactical shootings.

342
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,170
Yeah!

343
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,450
What are you doing?

344
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,210
Uh, hi, my name is Aris.

345
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,570
I've been a long time with that.

346
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,090
Well, as a- One thing I always like is when you do the, uh, meadow stream.

347
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,030
Which, is that something you never revisit again?

348
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,970
Oh, absolutely.

349
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,990
I've been wanting to do that for, like, the longest time.

350
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,650
Obviously, like, it takes a lot of prep time to do these things.

351
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,430
So, and, like, I've been so busy.

352
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,450
So, I don't have time to, like, do I actually, like, cook for myself?

353
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,170
Or, like, you know, prepare, like, these types of streams?

354
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,930
Because, like I said, it takes a lot of amount of prep.

355
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,450
Also, I don't have a rice cooker.

356
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,770
I've been- What?!

357
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,630
What?!

358
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,530
What?!

359
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,470
What?!

360
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,850
I haven't bought a rice cooker.

361
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,230
So, that's, like, the number one thing I need to do.

362
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:25,630
But...

363
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,570
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,370
Oh, I'm fine.

365
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,190
I know.

366
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,430
I can't- I- I'm disgraced all Asians.

367
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,290
I can't use a pot, by the way.

368
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,090
I can't.

369
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,410
My ancestors will leave me in all these things to hell.

370
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,030
They're waiting on me through the gates.

371
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,110
Oh, that's a lot of questions.

372
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,030
I can't.

373
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,110
I can't.

374
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,120
I can't.

375
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,400
Hey, yo.

376
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,780
This is your boy, Jeff.

377
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,540
Thank you.

378
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,760
I'm going to check.

379
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,260
Is that a midwife here?

380
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:04,980
Yeah, I did.

381
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,900
Yeah!

382
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,390
Yeah!

383
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,990
It's like, oh wait, it's him again!

384
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,010
Yeah, I'm sure.

385
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,910
My boy, Walter.

386
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,930
It's an artist.

387
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:29,150
So, my question is, whenever you're interacting with Minton, you hang out in person.

388
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,030
What's the most pet peevee thing that you do to each other?

389
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,770
What's the most pet peevee thing we do to each other in real life?

390
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,930
Yes.

391
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:39,870
Okay.

392
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:40,750
Oh, man.

393
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,850
I'm trying to- I just know, like, every time- Like, sometimes I do things to reach Peter.

394
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,210
I'm just like, why are you like this?

395
00:22:51,990 --> 00:23:02,150
I can't, like, name an instance, because I like rage-painting her, because it's like, I just like seeing reactions of people, and she's just like, like, why are you like this?

396
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,930
Um, but yeah, that's basically, like, it's just me rage-painting her.

397
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,070
Okay.

398
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:15,610
Hello.

399
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,610
My name is Marcus.

400
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:17,730
Hello.

401
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:18,930
Alright.

402
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:25,170
My question for you is, um, for this year's scenario character poll, what did you vote for and why?

403
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,470
Okay.

404
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,210
Okay.

405
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,090
I- Perfect.

406
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,250
Okay.

407
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,830
I know, like, I know there's gonna be some haters out there, but I don't care.

408
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:45,470
But obviously, I will vote for my first- my- my Kami Oshii, Sinomura, because, like, I don't care if he has won for, like, five plus years in a row.

409
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,370
I don't care.

410
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,990
This is the greed they talk about in the Bible.

411
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,030
He deserves to be number one.

412
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:01,370
And if you're mad that he's always number one, then maybe you should have supported your Oshii better.

413
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:01,450
I don't care.

414
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,430
I voted for Sinomura.

415
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,290
He shall be king for other- for years, for generations, until the universe dies.

416
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,090
I don't fucking care.

417
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:37,330
Oh, my favorite part is that Kampampurak almost beat- I don't know if he beats Sinomura, but he was, like, first or second place or some shit at the character polls, but then- but then they kept drawing him, like, his ass up, because- like, you know, showing his butt,

418
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,870
and then, like, I remember seeing, like, a Sinomura fast, and they're like, Sni!

419
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,830
I hear Sni!

420
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,050
I hear Sni!

421
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,690
I hear Sni!

422
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:57,250
Um, hi, uh, in all your years as a VTuber, what is, like, your favorite fan interaction or moment that has happened to you?

423
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,550
My favorite fan interactions, oh my gosh.

424
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,110
Oh!

425
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:15,730
I think my favorite- I think it has to be, like, the very first time I've ever seen, like, a cosplayer doing a Me and Green with me, because it's, like, like, someone that's cosplaying me, because it's, like, you know, such a unique experience to be like,

426
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:16,550
wait, that's me!

427
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,070
Oh my god, hi, don't you?

428
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:28,870
But I think that's, like, the most fun part for me when I see, like, you know, obviously, like, cosplaying, as you need, might take a lot of- especially during the summer, if you're trying to cosplay, like, I'm hungry.

429
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:39,370
Um, skin suit, I didn't think this through, because I forgot wearing leather jackets is, like, really, really hot, and there's a lot of people at conventions, so it means it gets even hotter.

430
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:49,350
So, I was like, I did think this through, I was like, oh, man, this is gonna be easy to cosplay, and then I realized, oh, man, you're in a sauna right now wearing my cosplay.

431
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,430
Hi.

432
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:54,930
Hello.

433
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:02,090
My question is, you have some pretty iconic expressions that you've made before.

434
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:10,070
I was wondering if you kind of, like, test out your rhythm before streams, or if they happen more sporadically?

435
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,130
Oh, they just happen.

436
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,530
Me testing things before streams?

437
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,910
And then they get on my PC and just be like, start streaming.

438
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:30,710
And there have been too many instances where, you know, people be like, Cookie, did you not test your game before the stream?

439
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,010
And I'd be like, uh...

440
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:39,870
Like, what do you think as I boot up my super, waiting for a game to tap in leather?

441
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,750
Hey, thank you.

442
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,030
Hey!

443
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,390
Say you drank a bit too much the night before, and you need to end.

444
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,190
What would, uh, your tactics be?

445
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,670
Oh, my God.

446
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,630
I'm like, too much.

447
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,150
And I'm like, boy, am I like, hum-over?

448
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,090
So, that, did you know that I am primary for gamers?

449
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,170
Oh, my God.

450
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,430
Get back.

451
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:25,850
Get back.

452
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,930
Chug down some caffeine and be like, start streaming.

453
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,590
If I get a heart attack on stream, I get a heart attack.

454
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,090
I love it, but it is what it is.

455
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,090
Yes.

456
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,150
Hello, Mario.

457
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,010
I don't know if this is a number of characters, but does this guy come for him?

458
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,350
Is this, is it a favorite, but he actually has that kind of thing?

459
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,270
Question.

460
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,680
Hi, Donkey.

461
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,200
Hey.

462
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,520
My question is, what's the favorite rabbit hole you've ever gone down, ever in a row?

463
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,880
Recently.

464
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,560
Oh, that's different though.

465
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,400
Because, like, okay.

466
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Okay, so, I'll confess this as off guy.

467
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,100
But, like, okay, so, I've never watched, uh, what's that show called?

468
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,800
Arcane?

469
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,800
I've never watched Arcane.

470
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,180
I have so many friends begging me to watch Arcane.

471
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,480
But the one thing that's stopping me from watching Arcane is that league.

472
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,280
And that's too scary.

473
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,820
I'm scared.

474
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,320
I don't want to get addicted to league.

475
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,200
I've never played league before.

476
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,080
And I don't want Arcane to be the one that, like, gets me into league.

477
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,740
Because I'm afraid of league.

478
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,960
I'm in a row.

479
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,400
I've seen what it's done to people.

480
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,640
And I'm scared.

481
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:24,040
So, but, like, one of my friends has been begging me to watch League of Legends Arcane for so long.

482
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,440
And they were like, no, you have to.

483
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,900
It's so good.

484
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,440
And I was like, I was like, I can't.

485
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,080
I can't go.

486
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,980
I'm scared.

487
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,940
I'm so scared.

488
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,780
I've seen what league can do to people.

489
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,340
But, like, I got curious.

490
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:52,640
So, I, look, you know, like, when you get curious about a show or a book that you, or, like, a game that you've never watched, and then you dive into, like, the fandom Wikipedia page, and then, like, two hours later, you're jumping between articles because you're,

491
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,320
like, wondering, oh, okay, so what's happening next?

492
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,700
Like, oh, wait, that's interesting.

493
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,340
What's this?

494
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,900
So, I've done that several times for different fandoms.

495
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,000
Like, I've done it for, like, Star Wars because, like, I got curious.

496
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,600
Because I've never actually watched Star Wars.

497
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,360
I've only watched three Star Wars movies in my whole entire life.

498
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,180
And it was, like, the first, very first Star Wars movie.

499
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,560
And the very first Star Wars movie in the, what's that one it's called?

500
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,900
The one with Rey, and the first one from that.

501
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,760
And then the first one from, um, god, what was it called?

502
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm sorry, Star Wars, but it's, like, the trickles.

503
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,640
So, I've always watched the first movie out of all these installments.

504
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,400
But, like, I got really curious about the lore and everything.

505
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,840
So, I just, like, read the art, Wikipedia pages, and then I could dive into it.

506
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,040
So, I did that for Arkane.

507
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,380
And then, like, there's, like, two characters in Arkane.

508
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,520
What are their names?

509
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,600
Um, it's, like, the Russian guy in the Latinx show, right?

510
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,600
That's pretty good.

511
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,740
That's pretty good.

512
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,920
And I was like, wait, are they, you know, happy Pride Month?

513
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,060
I was like, what are they?

514
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,560
I was like, what are they?

515
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,160
I was like, wait, are they?

516
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,500
And then my friend was like, no one else.

517
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,700
They're just really, really good friends.

518
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:19,090
And then, like, I was like, really good roommate.

519
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,430
And then my friend was like, okay, maybe.

520
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,450
So, that was like the thing.

521
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,230
I was like, oh, so you could say that you're good roommates, right?

522
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,110
And he was like, yeah, you could say that.

523
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,950
And he was like, really good roommates.

524
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,390
So that's like the rabbit hole I've recently been into.

525
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,730
Hi, Doki.

526
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,810
Devin here.

527
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,750
Very nice to be here.

528
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,070
Hello.

529
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,730
My question is a bit of a math refresher.

530
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,690
I'm just wondering, can you tell me what is the largest hole number?

531
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:59,790
Okay, honestly, I know what it is now.

532
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,970
And I thought it was two.

533
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,470
If you remember that thought, I was like, oh, is it two?

534
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:12,130
But obviously, I didn't even believe in myself because I almost failed math.

535
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,650
So I was like, and it's like first grade.

536
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,270
Do you know how?

537
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,070
It's so many years ago since first grade.

538
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:23,770
When will I ever have to do anything where I have to know what a whole number is?

539
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,970
Anyway, but yes, I know it's two.

540
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,510
The next greatest number is two.

541
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,910
Thank you.

542
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:34,930
Thank you.

543
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,050
Thank you.

544
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,730
Thank you.

545
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,590
Thank you.

546
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,440
Thank you.

547
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,480
Okay.

548
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,020
May you come up?

549
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,080
Aw.

550
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:44,820
It's Japanese.

551
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,140
The question is, I have a sister who plays Marvel Rivals on the regular.

552
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,780
What advice should I give to her to get better at the game?

553
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,440
Is she?

554
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:56,960
Okay.

555
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,300
What role does she play?

556
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,780
Um, I think last time I saw her was support?

557
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,000
I don't know.

558
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,580
She also played Scarlet Witch.

559
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,160
She plays Scarlet Witch and Rocket.

560
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,640
Oh my god.

561
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,700
Alright, my first advice is that she knows she has hands, right?

562
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:23,820
Okay.

563
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,680
Okay.

564
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,960
So, oh my god.

565
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,840
How can I give advice for Scarlet Witch?

566
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Like, that's... I didn't rock it.

567
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,680
Um, okay.

568
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:49,200
Um, well, if she wants to get better as either of those characters, since you don't need hands to play either of them, it's literally all about positioning and making sure, like, you're, you know, like, where you're standing.

569
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,360
And, like, when to disengage and when to engage.

570
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,100
Because Rocket, you know, he can fucking go everywhere.

571
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:02,600
Like, as long as, like, if you have less than three deaths, actually, no, maybe not.

572
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,280
I would say, like, four deaths are less on support, and you're doing a great job.

573
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,840
If you don't, if you have more than four deaths as Rocket, then you're doing something wrong.

574
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,260
Because Rocket can, like, jump everywhere.

575
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,380
You can dash everywhere.

576
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,480
You can climb every wall.

577
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:22,680
So, you have more than four deaths on Rocket, and you're losing, then it's because you're positioning such ass.

578
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,720
That's all I can say.

579
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,420
Okay, my question is, out of all the streams we've done, which one is your favorite?

580
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,420
Oh, oh, that's, I've done so many streams.

581
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,200
That's really, like, even on this channel alone, on, like, my current channel.

582
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,420
I've done, like, uh, like, oh my gosh, how many, how many videos do I have?

583
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,100
I'm trying to check my channel right now.

584
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,780
I have 774 videos on this current channel alone.

585
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,000
Oh, it's, oh, that's such a hard question.

586
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:19,020
I think, currently, so far, um, on my current channel, I think my favorite stream so far is either, uh, the, uh, either WrestleTuber.

587
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,440
Yeah!

588
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,780
Woooo!

589
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,860
Woooo!

590
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,180
Woooo!

591
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,020
Or, hardcore Minecraft.

592
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,360
Woooo!

593
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,320
Woooo!

594
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,640
Woooo!

595
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,060
Woooo!

596
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,420
The ending was pure cinema for that.

597
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,240
And my third choice would be the safe, the first stage and slime that we ever done.

598
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,480
Woooo!

599
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:39,860
Woooo!

600
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,340
Woooo!

601
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:40,880
Woooo!

602
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:40,980
Woooo!

603
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:51,960
Very good memories, very, great experience, um, met a lot of amazing people and, um, uh, Uh, yeah, honestly, those three tunes are my favorite so far for the Krayt channel.

604
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,960
Play more seconds!

605
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,580
Hey, Doki.

606
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,100
Hey!

607
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,980
My name is Ravery, and here's a question for you.

608
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:17,000
So, for any streamer slash YouTuber, what is the most difficult thing to do when they're getting started on YouTube or Twitch, and how do they overcome it by your experience?

609
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,500
Oh, okay, that's a good question.

610
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,620
I've been asked this a lot, too.

611
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,920
But, basically, obviously, I think the hardest part is just getting an audience.

612
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,800
That's the hardest part, because, you know, a lot of people start streaming, and then they're like, how do I get people to watch me?

613
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:49,700
Um, I highly suggest just, like, networking and getting to know other people in the community if you're starting out, especially because, like, um, you can, like, you can, like, collab with each other and, like, build off an audience through, like, your shared community.

614
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,460
Um, and, like, you know, getting to know other people.

615
00:36:52,620 --> 00:37:02,000
Like, a lot of viewers, I know, like, you guys might love to watch interactions between other YouTubers and, like, the stuff that people go through, and the relationship between other YouTubers as well.

616
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,900
So, like, that's a great way to get started.

617
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,240
Um, another way is that, um, taking back...

618
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:20,980
Um, I would highly suggest, because I know my channel is on YouTube, but I highly suggest for any, like, English-speaking VTuber or streamer to get started on Twitch, because Twitch is much more, um, much more friendly in terms of discovery.

619
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,560
Uh, because there's, like, you know, the discovery tab and stuff like that, and reading is a lot more straightforward, too, on Twitch.

620
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:40,440
Um, I'm on YouTube because, like, I like the platform a lot more because of the VOD system, and because I already have an established fan base, so I can't be on YouTube, because a lot of my viewers came from YouTube and just watching YouTube per VTubers in general.

621
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:56,660
But, um, I think if you're, like, an NA VTuber or, like, someone that streams in English, Twitch is, like, the best way to start, and then you basically put all your short content, you know, you'll use the shorts algorithm, and then make, like, the VODs videos and stuff and all that on your YouTube channel,

622
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:13,960
because shorts is a great way to increase discoverability, and YouTube loves the shorts algorithm, so even if, like, you're, like, a small timer, and you, like, manage to, like, have, like, one viral clip from just abusing shorts, like, it can help a lot,

623
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,500
basically, because YouTube will push you more.

624
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:27,000
I don't know, like, if you ever scroll through the shorts feed on YouTube, sometimes you can get, like, random, like, you know, videos with, like, not a lot of comments, not a lot of views, because YouTube loves pushing short content out to people.

625
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,120
But, yeah, that's my advice to you guys.

626
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,180
Hey, Loki!

627
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,280
Hey!

628
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,320
So, my question is a bit of a hypothetical.

629
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:47,360
If you just got stranded on an island, how do you think you would survive?

630
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,840
I would be impressed if I lived past the second day.

631
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:06,580
It's like, okay, I don't know if you guys know this, but, like, my career revolves around me staying inside.

632
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,160
So I don't really, I don't really touch grass very often.

633
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:23,880
I, I, like, I complain when my internet is even, like, like, if it's, like, ten seconds lower, I complain, because I cannot live without buying an internet.

634
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,360
I've been a city girl for, like, a hundred percent of my life.

635
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:38,880
Even if you take me to a rural area, I'd be surprised I would live past two, like, a week in a rural area, because I don't know if I could.

636
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:45,020
Like, I feel like I will walk, I will walk into the wild, and then you'll never see me again.

637
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,100
Like, I don't know.

638
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,540
I have too many bad experiences of being outside.

639
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,360
I don't know if I am, if I can survive outside.

640
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,460
Hey, darling.

641
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,680
Hello!

642
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:03,880
Hello.

643
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,780
Thank you.

644
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,280
Very good.

645
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,060
I wanted to thank you and curse you real quick for editing me in Tekken.

646
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,460
Yeah, I got to make stuff, like, six times last night by a gym playing like that.

647
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,860
I don't know if she's meta now.

648
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:23,900
Yeah.

649
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:32,180
Yeah, I heard that, like, Saikoto went from, like, bronze to, like, master in, like, a couple of days, which is crazy.

650
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,260
I'm genuinely...

651
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,040
like, ladders are killing people right now.

652
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,700
So...

653
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:43,560
My question is, um, you know, I've been trying to get other people, you know, spread the hatred, and get more people into Tekken.

654
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:53,320
Was there ever a moment when you were learning it, like, where it kind of clicked, and it became fun, or it wasn't just, like, a significant emotional moment the whole time?

655
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,420
Blanking.

656
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:09,440
Any grappling characters is what, like, finally clicked for me, because, like, I said this before on stream, but, like, I feel like grapplers are, like, the best rage-baiting type of character.

657
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,640
And then, like, when you rage-bait someone successfully, that's, like, what gives me the most energy.

658
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,920
Because you know they're so angry.

659
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,460
And then, obviously, everyone knows that I'm, like, infamous for, like, a one-and-done.

660
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,900
Like, I never rematch, because I was like, why?

661
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,540
Because I know how mad the other person will get if I just don't give them a rematch.

662
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,380
And then they'll never fight me again for that rematch, too.

663
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,860
But that gives me the most energy.

664
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:49,480
Just knowing how angry the other person gets because of who I play, and me just leaving the match after one game.

665
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,400
I don't give her...

666
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,980
Eh?

667
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,580
I have a simple one.

668
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,280
What's your favorite cheese?

669
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,220
It's my favorite.

670
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,960
Three cheese.

671
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,660
I love three cheese.

672
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,200
Yes!

673
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,080
Good question.

674
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,520
Very good question.

675
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,580
Little Kate.

676
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,640
Eh?

677
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,520
I don't know if you remember me from the...

678
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,600
Oh, you're one of the people that got the stand.

679
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,040
Yeah.

680
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,520
It was great to see you just come in on us.

681
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,180
We're mid-auction.

682
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,240
Yeah, and I, like, encouraged you to be hired.

683
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,800
Yeah, that was really great.

684
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,360
I want to go back to the Tekken topic.

685
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,040
There's a new wrestler coming.

686
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:57,900
Honestly, I think, like, whenever I ever get back into, like, a fighting game, it has to be, like, a tournament style.

687
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,760
I don't know if I can...

688
00:42:59,760 --> 00:42:59,920
Because...

689
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,680
Because I remember...

690
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,500
I played...

691
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,560
Oh, man, what's that game?

692
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,900
The 2XKO game for me?

693
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:13,300
Because it was, like, you know, it was right after, like, it was, like, fighting craze, and everybody was, like, hanging up 2XKO.

694
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,060
So I was just like, alright, I'm gonna try.

695
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,180
And then...

696
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,580
I just get my ass beat by you, Dragon.

697
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,760
Trying to play 2XKO with the dragons.

698
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,640
I think that if I ever go back into, like, Tekken or Street Fighter, it definitely has to be a tournament setting.

699
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,080
Because then, like, you know, at least I can, like...

700
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,200
At least I know that I'm playing against other people that are, like, my level.

701
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,420
You know, that are not, like, out there to just beat my ass.

702
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,400
And so...

703
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,520
That's, like, the only time I'll ever come back, really.

704
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,280
Oh, hi, Doggy!

705
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,300
Hello!

706
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,240
Hi!

707
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:59,220
Since you've become a YouTuber, I know you've been able to travel a lot, go to, like, Japan and other places.

708
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,700
I was just curious if you could travel to anywhere in the world, where would you want to travel to?

709
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,500
Where would I...

710
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,320
Well, I'm...

711
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,940
Okay, truth be told, I'm so Japano.

712
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,120
Like...

713
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,900
And you're like, How could you get tired of listening to Japan...

714
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:26,440
Okay, guys, when you have to go to Japan, like, so often for, like, business trips and stuff like that, you can actually get so tired of traveling that...

715
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,200
Because, like, for me, I also have to travel, like...

716
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,640
Because, like, from Canada to Japan, it's, like, what, like, a 12-hour flight each time, too.

717
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,920
And that is so exhausting.

718
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:51,500
And, um, but, uh, for me, if I have to say that I want to travel somewhere right now, I would definitely be to, like, Hong Kong, because, like, for me, I do...

719
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,000
I haven't been back to Hong Kong in a long time, and I do miss the food there, and...

720
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,060
and shopping there, as well.

721
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,120
So I would say...

722
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,340
I would say Hong Kong, yeah.

723
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,960
I really want to go to, like, Ocean Park to see the pandas, because I want to see, like...

724
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,620
I want to see those, like, fat little shits and...

725
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:14,020
Boh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

726
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,780
Oh, hey, Orca.

727
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,600
Hi, Orca.

728
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,240
Hi.

729
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:18,940
Hi.

730
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:19,440
Hi.

731
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,920
Yeah?

732
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,140
My question, I

733
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,940
want to ask you a question.

734
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,380
Definitely the hair.

735
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,880
I love the hair style.

736
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,980
I love the hair.

737
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,320
It's my favorite part, for sure.

738
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:54,120
Also, I realized why you guys put the water balloons, because I saw some comments about the water balloons.

739
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,020
I now know why men would like, would like, why.

740
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,780
I never saw the preview of that months ago.

741
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,220
Hi, Doki.

742
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,360
It's Stick the Figure.

743
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,560
I know it's been a long time, but I was wondering if you'd ever consider doing a wild animal racing tournament again?

744
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,060
Because you definitely should do it with the giraffe last time, but you never still play.

745
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,760
Alright, if we ever get a rematch, it won't be for wild animal racing.

746
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,700
It'll be on the Sonic racing game.

747
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:49,360
The season passed, and apparently not only can you play as Steve from Minecraft, but you can also play as a SpongeBob too.

748
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,840
It's

749
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,250
$50.

750
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,350
It's $50.

751
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,820
Ooh, question time.

752
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,520
Hi, Doki.

753
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:13,740
Hey.

754
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,960
My name is Morty, and I've been loving the inspirational out-of-bring screens recently.

755
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,780
Inspirational?

756
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,220
That's such a praise.

757
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,840
And I wanted to ask if there are any other game types physically you want to get into.

758
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,300
But first, before you answer that, I also wanted to ask your opinion on this...

759
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,120
Grrrr.

760
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,580
Oh my god.

761
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,800
Oh my god.

762
00:47:59,600 --> 00:47:59,960
Oh my god.

763
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,700
Who was your actual question?

764
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,160
That actresses are locked in.

765
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,260
Wait, wait, what was the question again?

766
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,100
I actually forgot.

767
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,540
There's a new type of game you want to get into.

768
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,240
Oh, a new type of game you want to get into.

769
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,660
Um...

770
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:21,660
I feel like I've played a lot of different game genres over the years of streaming.

771
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,620
So, that's a hard question.

772
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,460
Because I played...

773
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,640
I played everything.

774
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,380
But the one thing I refuse to play on stream...

775
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,860
is JRPG.

776
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,600
Like, nothing can convince me to play JRPG.

777
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,340
Because first off, that requires me to read.

778
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,920
That's already a very difficult hurdle to get through.

779
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,240
But...

780
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,200
I actually don't know.

781
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,880
I feel like I've played a lot of games.

782
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:49,900
Like, different genres.

783
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,040
I've done, like, roguelikes.

784
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,100
I've done, like, FPS, TTS.

785
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,640
I've done, like, um...

786
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,760
RTS games.

787
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,920
I've done, um...

788
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,860
That's, like, four genres I just named out.

789
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,980
But I know I did more.

790
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,600
I know I did more than four!

791
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,200
Um...

792
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,480
But honestly, I don't know.

793
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,420
Because...

794
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,840
I've done, like, so many games I've always wanted to play.

795
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:10,920
I did.

796
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:12,940
Maybe, like...

797
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,180
Mmm...

798
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,620
I would like to do more, like, Dungeons & Dragons type stuff.

799
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,240
Because I've done it, like, once.

800
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,940
I like how the guys are like, YES!

801
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,140
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS!

802
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,360
Yay!

803
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:24,260
Yay!

804
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:24,480
Yay!

805
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:24,920
Yay!

806
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,760
I've done it once.

807
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,760
It was, like...

808
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,120
A long time ago.

809
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,660
Um, I was like...

810
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,340
Who was it?

811
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:32,840
It was, like...

812
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,520
I don't know, like, sure who was in it.

813
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,140
As well as, um...

814
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,680
Um...

815
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:37,820
Um...

816
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,260
Oh my gosh.

817
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,040
Oh my gosh.

818
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:40,340
And...

819
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,500
Oh my gosh.

820
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,760
It was so long ago.

821
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,360
I'm trying to, like, remember who was in it.

822
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,140
Um...

823
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,580
But I would love to do it with other YouTubers, too.

824
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,820
Like, D&D.

825
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,360
That was a good experience.

826
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,420
I'd love to do it again.

827
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,620
We have time for one last question.

828
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,780
Oh, last question!

829
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,220
Hi, Ducky.

830
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,720
I'm named Starlord in Marvel Rivals.

831
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,780
And I always like to play 80s music when I play.

832
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,060
Especially in the Japanese city club.

833
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,940
When you play Marvel Rivals, what music do you like to play?

834
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,640
When I'm playing Marvel Rivals?

835
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,820
Oh, for real?

836
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,780
I don't play music when I'm doing competitive.

837
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:28,220
Because I'm so locked in that my mind is tuned out when it comes to music in general.

838
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:33,620
But I have such a weird taste of music because I like everything in general.

839
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,180
I think if you look at my channel, you'll see...

840
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:42,060
And actually, some people might not notice, but I do have like a playlist that I've made for like...

841
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,020
That was made like years ago.

842
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,180
And sometimes I add songs to it, but...

843
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:53,000
If you look at my channel, there's like a playlist channel there that I used to play when I streamed back in the Park Bikes era.

844
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,860
And that usually shows like all the primary songs that I used to listen to.

845
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,500
Like with my stream and stuff, but...

846
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,000
Usually when I play piano, I don't listen to music because like...

847
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,080
I don't notice music playing because I'm just so locked in.

848
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,330
I guess that was the last question, right?

849
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:25,950
Did you see me again, you did?

850
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:25,990
Yes.

851
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:26,030
Yeah.

852
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:26,070
Yeah.

853
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,350
Also, if you guys have anyιαoba guests...
