1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,370
So I bought two people missing.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,450
I'm here.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,510
I gotta go live now.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,410
Live now.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,770
Hashtag ad.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,650
Live now.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,470
You have to do create.

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,630
Go to the create tab.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,050
And then you'll see the lobby.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,210
And the password is... I can't say it out loud.

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,930
I think I just leaked it because it wasn't starred.

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,330
Wait, what?

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,410
I expected it to be starred and my game capture was not signed.

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,950
I packed the wrong person on Twitter.

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,410
Well, if they ask, it's not our fault.

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,710
We don't know what happened.

17
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,170
Yeah, I didn't do it.

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,410
It's not our fault.

19
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,970
I packed the wrong person on Twitter because, Mac, you don't have your own tag?

20
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,270
Yeah, dude.

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,510
Some fucking dickhead for the past three years took it and he updates his bio.

22
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,970
Active at this point.

23
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,770
We've hit a year.

24
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,150
So I can't fucking get it.

25
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,810
And he's been, like, trying to make me live.

26
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,730
So I just get a free promo, dude.

27
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,270
Yeah, dude.

28
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,590
Chat settings.

29
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:02,330
Wait.

30
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,790
Did he try to, like, extort you for money?

31
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:06,970
Yeah.

32
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,850
Wait, really?

33
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,590
How much did he ask for you?

34
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,290
Like, fucking 8K.

35
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,050
He asked $8,000?

36
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,750
He's smoking dick, dude.

37
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,490
Bro, what?

38
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:17,490
Yeah.

39
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,650
I literally just told him to fuck himself.

40
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,170
Holy shit.

41
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,210
8K.

42
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,270
I don't know how to turn on the voice chat.

43
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,250
What?

44
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:25,850
Proximity?

45
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,130
How do you do that?

46
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:26,810
I...

47
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,470
You want to fucking yell at people?

48
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,230
Or hear Taxi yelling.

49
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,650
Does he have to?

50
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,670
Is Taxi even in our group?

51
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,190
No, he got eliminated in Group A.

52
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,530
He got eliminated?

53
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,070
He got eliminated.

54
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,890
He got eliminated.

55
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,090
He got noobed out, dude?

56
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,590
Yeah.

57
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,610
That's awesome.

58
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,950
He was sweating this game hard.

59
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,930
Yeah, I was gonna say.

60
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,010
Was he streaming this?

61
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,030
Yeah, he got... By the way, he got 10th, by the way.

62
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:52,770
Sometimes...

63
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,790
That won't be us.

64
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,350
That won't be us.

65
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,410
Yeah, um...

66
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:55,590
Really?

67
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,690
Yeah, now I'm scared.

68
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,630
We're gonna get karma.

69
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,470
We're gonna...

70
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,730
I feel like we're getting cut, bro.

71
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,610
I'm literally just gonna see the first person.

72
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,490
I'm gonna run at them.

73
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,650
And then...

74
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,130
If my team helps me, then my team helps me.

75
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,170
Oh, to be fair.

76
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:10,910
To be fair.

77
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,730
RPR died first last...

78
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,530
Like, was the one to full wipe first.

79
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,090
What do you mean died first?

80
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,010
You were full wipe first last game.

81
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,790
No, it was...

82
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,770
It was Surefour.

83
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,430
You...

84
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,810
Remember he won the Gulag?

85
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,730
No, no.

86
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,250
Not that.

87
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,090
I meant full wipe.

88
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,590
He had a second res.

89
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,490
But you lost your second res first.

90
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,030
No, it was Surefour again that I got full wipe.

91
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,450
Are you sure?

92
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,970
Yes, because I remember when he said, There's one guy.

93
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,870
There's one guy.

94
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,630
Then I came on the hill and I died right after.

95
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,010
The frick is the voice chat settings.

96
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,110
In the audio.

97
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,210
You have to do it when...

98
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,690
It's not there.

99
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,070
No, you have to do it when we're starting.

100
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,850
I'm pretty sure.

101
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,930
Wait.

102
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,250
Why is...

103
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:48,550
Yeah.

104
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,170
Also, like...

105
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,330
Why can I only change voice chat when I'm in?

106
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,670
Now we have Nia Moka in our team because you're trolling, dude.

107
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,270
Yeah.

108
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,330
Fron is in this game.

109
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:58,870
Yeah.

110
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,510
I'm trying to...

111
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,990
I'm trying to add my thing.

112
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,130
I like how you can talk with emojis in this game, dude.

113
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:04,870
That's true.

114
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,790
Let me see.

115
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,590
I told her to move and she moved.

116
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:10,610
Okay.

117
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,870
I need a...

118
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,990
Wow, you're so alpha.

119
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,130
What the fuck?

120
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,410
Yeah.

121
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:21,790
Yeah.

122
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,610
Bring sure if...

123
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:22,870
Yo, Ducky.

124
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,490
You're in my arrivals on Twitch.

125
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:25,650
Oh.

126
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,310
Dude.

127
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,270
The sponsorship's going great.

128
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:34,890
Okay.

129
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,530
Hey, look.

130
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,330
That's not my fault.

131
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,950
My boss could have changed the game at any moment.

132
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,910
Oh, now you're blaming your boss.

133
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,190
Blame the boss.

134
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,430
You're the streamer.

135
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,570
Class on YouTube.

136
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,250
You're the favorite.

137
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,090
Listen.

138
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,970
My mods, dude.

139
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:47,490
Yeah.

140
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,550
I'm a streamer.

141
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,110
Alright.

142
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,090
Wait.

143
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,270
I need to pin the thing, too, for my chat.

144
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,610
I forgot to do that, too.

145
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,410
Hey, just checking.

146
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,690
The admin's asking where you are.

147
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:03,910
Bro, they're asking where you are.

148
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,490
We're all literally waiting for you.

149
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,430
We're all-

150
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,590
There's something random in our...

151
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,690
I think it's a random in our team, Slaughter and admin.

152
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,290
Or Phil.

153
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,430
Okay, let me do it.

154
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,530
They already got a sub for us.

155
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,960
Why is your name that, buddy?

156
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,220
Guys, I'm going to restart my stream so it starts on the... so the VOD is on the game.

157
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,580
That's insane, dude.

158
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,020
See, I'm a professional.

159
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,540
Hashtag add.

160
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,860
I'm restarting the game.

161
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,540
Restarting the stream.
