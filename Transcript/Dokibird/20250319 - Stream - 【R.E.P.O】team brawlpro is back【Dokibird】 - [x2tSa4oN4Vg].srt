Hellooo I just started my stream We're live Bro, everyone thought we were waiting People were like, oh we must be waiting for Doki She's the one that's late No, it was Brawl Pro that requested the stream To be pushed up 30 minutes And then...

4
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,210
So that's why I was...

5
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:54,030
Cause I was talking to my stream I was like, okay I can't... I'm not home right now And they're like, well I can't believe Doki's playing Brawl Pro For the reason why the stream was pushed back But it was because Brawl Pro pushed back the stream That I went outside to get errands done Because I had an extra 30 minutes That's why I wasn't home Cause this guy needs to eat Even though he doesn't want to eat on stream

6
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:07,290
You could've eaten on stream Yeah, I'm listening I'm listening What do you mean you don't remember it?

Okay, now we have two, but some of the items don't show up.

Yeah.

Whoops.

129
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:18,810
It's okay.

130
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,570
Also, I brought up the volume a little bit, Chad.

131
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,410
Let me know if it's better.

132
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,130
Alright, I'm going to break this plate.

133

Watch this.

134
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,430
Oh, I did it.

135
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,190
It doesn't break if you throw it in the thing.

136
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,010
No, it does.

137
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,770
It does if you throw it too hard.

138
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,470
Alright, is there anything in the toilet?

139
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,310
No, it's not even... there's not even water in the toilet.

Yeah, that's a... this is a big boy.

It's a big boy.

144
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,570
I got a big boy.

145
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,970
Wait, we already have enough for one.

146
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,750
We should put this back.

147
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,930
I'm pushing.

148
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:08,950
Where is it?

149
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,350
Beep, beep.

150
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,150
Beep, beep.

151
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,530
Stay in the shopping cart.

152
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,730
I don't know if I want to.

153
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,210
Should I?

154
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,230
Stay in there.

155
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,770
You'll be safe.

156
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,270
No, it'll res you.

157
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,270
It'll res you.

158
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,410
I'll trust me.

159
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,070
I'll be resurrected twice.

160
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,930
I'm going to heaven.

161
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,770
Do you think he went to heaven?

00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,510
There, see?

163
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,230
What's heaven?

164
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,410
I actually lived twice.

165
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:44,970
I can't believe it.

166
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,190
Yes, see?

167
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,310
I told you.

168
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,270
I can't believe... man, you didn't believe me?

169
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:57,350
I can't believe you didn't believe me after everything we've been through.

170
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,970
I know, it was...

171
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,970
How could you?

172
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,150
I'll go in the cart, my bad.

173
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,170
Alright, get in the cart, child.

174
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,830
It's Costco time.

175
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,190
Ow!

176
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:06,810
I can't do it.

177
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,670
It's Costco time.

178
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,230
Are you ready for the free samples?

179
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,630
Oh, dude, I love Costco free samples.

180
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,930
Okay, where did he go?

181
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:21,070
Whenever you actually go... when was the last time you went outside?

182
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,130
Hello?

183
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,990
Is this somebody's head?

184
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,170
Oh my god, there's a giant spider in his skull!

185
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,170
Oh my god.

186
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,500
You can't get me.

187
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,740
You can't get me.

188
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,120
Get out of there.

189
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,900
I hope the head gets you.

190
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,580
I hope the head gets you, guys.

191
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,140
I hope it gets you.

192
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,520
I was gonna feed you to the head.

193
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,620
You know, yeah?

194
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,660
Ah!

195
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,140
Wait, it's Trash Importer.

196
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,560
Coney!

197
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,160
Coney, there's a duck, Coney!

198
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,200
I hope he touches the duck.

199
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,260
Hey, Void, help!

200
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,220
Help me carry this!

201
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,020
It's 11k here!

202
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,820
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

203
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,840
It's 11k right here!

204
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,500
Guys, I think they're dead.

205
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,960
They're awfully quiet.

206
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,200
I don't think they're alive anymore.

207
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
Why are they so quiet?

208
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,600
I'm pretty sure they're dead, guys.

209
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,080
I think they're dead.

210
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,360
I think they were, like, laughing about the head, and then now I don't hear them anymore.

211
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,020
So I think the head got... okay.

212
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,060
Wait, there's a guy!

213
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,260
11k here!

214
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:32,780
Void!

215
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,400
Pick it up!

216
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,020
Where's our inch head?

217
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,920
Where's our Bidoof?

218
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,780
Get the Bidoof over here!

219
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,540
Don't touch the duck, though.

220
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,480
No, the duck's worth 20k.

221
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,440
I checked earlier.

222
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,180
Oh, I don't think so.

223
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,620
Nice try!

224
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,100
He told me all about this silly duck!

225
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,800
Oh my god, is that even possible?

226
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,260
Oh no, we have to get rid of the money.

227
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,220
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

228
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,940
Okay, we'll put the money out.

229
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,800
I'll hold the money.

230
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,140
Hold the 5k.

231
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,660
What's the worst that could happen?

232
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,860
Alright, I'm gonna grab this.

233
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,320
I'm putting the 5k here.

234
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,660
Wait, where is it?

235
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,400
Is it up here?

236
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,640
Oh, it's up here.

237
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,100
What the fuck, there's stairs now?

238
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,780
Wait, wait, wait.

239
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,500
Guys, my chat is begging me to click the duck.

240
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,800
I'm not gonna do it.

241
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,460
I'm not gonna do it.

242
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,720
That is very clearly not... he is so desperate for attention.

243
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm not doing it.

244
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,040
There's clearly something up there.

245
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,680
This is a 6 player game, right?

246
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Dude, we could play with the duck.

247
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,340
Isn't that right, duck?

248
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,960
Yeah, click the duck!

249
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,620
Oh my god!

250
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,520
I'm alive, let's get out of here.

251
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,880
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

252
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,840
I made a big mistake!

253
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,780
I made a big mistake!

254
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,300
I made a big mistake!

255
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,680
Surely there's no monsters here.

256
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,200
Dude, guys, look at the duck.

257
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,480
Isn't the duck so cute?

258
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,640
He's so cute, right?

259
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,720
I'm outta here.

260
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,240
Oh, goodbye.

261
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,460
I'm assuming he died.

262
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,360
I'll get his head, don't worry.

263
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,240
Oh, I made a mistake.

264
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,060
I clicked the duck.

265
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,580
I thought the duck would attack everybody.

266
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,820
Whoops.

267
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,460
Doki, where are you?

268
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,160
Oh, I got the duck following me.

269
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,400
Oh, thank god!

270
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,840
Thank you.

271
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
What a hero.

272
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,680
I wanna click this so bad.

273
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,800
What if I just click it?

274
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,200
What if I just click it?

275
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,120
You're gonna be a hero.

276
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,580
Alright, I'll count down to ten.

277
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,660
If nobody comes back, we leave.

278
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,840
Oh my god, you're back.

279
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,740
Wait, did Coney die?

280
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,320
Okay.

281
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,900
No, no, you see here?

282
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,660
When we're rezzed.

283
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

284
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,680
Oh, Matt's a goner.

285
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,420
No, he's dead.

286
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,360
He's been dead for a while now.

287
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,500
Really?

288
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,400
We'll figure it out if you press this.

289
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,900
We'll figure it out who's alive.

290
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,840
How long do we wait for it?

291
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,760
Oh, oh, oh, there's somebody.

292
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,400
You made it.

293
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,640
Oh, you made it!

294
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,040
Hey, so Coney's totally dead.

295
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,780
I was trying to grab his head, but the skull is gatekeeping.

296
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,980
Yeah, and Void wants to be a hero.

297
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,340
Should we give him a timer?

298
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,220
Let's give him a timer.

299
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,680
Oh my god!

300
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,720
Alright.

301
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,660
Alright, here we go, Void.

302
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,940
I believe in you!

303
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,360
You got this, Void!

304
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
You can be the hero you've always wanted to be!

305
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,020
That is not gonna happen.

306
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,900
I'm just gonna say you told me to do it.

307
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,540
You said, yeah.

308
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,680
I said, do we give him a timer?

309
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,200
I'll own up to it.

310
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,260
Yeah, it was all on me.

311
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,840
I said, do we give him a timer?

312
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,200
You said, yes.

313
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Get Coney's head!

314
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,220
Get Coney's head!

315
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,720
What happened?

316
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,660
Where's Void?

317
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,000
What do you mean?

318
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,940
He's right here!

319
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,260
It's right here!

320
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,760
Oh, you made it, Void!

321
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,280
Hey, everybody!

322
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,040
Get Coney's head!

323
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,560
Get Coney's head!

324
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,140
Alright, Coney, we got you more HMs!

325
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,460
Yes, please!

326
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,620
Yum, yum, yum!

327
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,520
Yum, yum, yum!

328
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,440
Feed him all the HMs, guys!

329
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,100
Void's eyes turned red and I got scared!

330
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,600
I don't know what happened there!

331
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,580
That was crazy!

332
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,560
We have a lot more money!

333
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,600
Okay, how do I...

334
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,740
Do I bring up Matt's voice a bit?

335
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,040
Okay.

336
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,620
If you want...

337
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,160
No, you do not!

338
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,700
No, you do not!

339
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,040
I just died!

340
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,840
No, you do not!

341
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,580
I just died!

342
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,400
I deserve a nice treat!

343
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,720
I have seen the afterlife!

344
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,300
What did you see?

345
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,620
What did you see?

346
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,840
God told me I needed that!

347
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,260
What are you gonna do?

348
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,780
What can you kill?

349
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,820
What can you kill with that?

350
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,820
Well, we'll have to see!

351
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,360
We'll get rid of this.

352
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,560
Can we kill those those little floating thingies with the hammers?

353
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,400
What?

354
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,840
The ones that spin?

355
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:20,500
No!

356
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,700
It'll be fine!

357
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,960
My hammer!

358
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,520
No, keep it on here!

359
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,540
Keep it on here!

360
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,200
Oh, shit!

361
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,240
Okay.

362
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,260
I thought I was gonna get crushed!

363
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,600
Alright, let's move.

364
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,980
Oh my god!

365
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,620
Oh my god, it jumps!

366
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,620
Okay, we got the hammer!

367
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Alright, let's go.

368
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,780
Wait, we did?

369
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,380
I'll take it to the cart!

370
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,400
Wait, why are you destroying this place with it?

371
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,520
Here we go!

372
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,740
Oh boy!

373
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,240
I hope we paid for this!

374
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,400
We did!

375
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,700
Alright, Kony!

376
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,300
Get ready!

377
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,820
Eat your vegetables!

378
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,160
Where's my hammer?

379
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,240
Kony, eat your vegetables, Kony!

380
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,040
I have a feeling Doggy Bird might have lied.

381
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,840
Eat your vegetables!

382
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,200
So you can grow big and strong!

383
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,300
I'm ready to go!

384
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,800
As an HM slave, what's Kony doing for us?

385
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,740
He can basically pick things up stronger.

386
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,840
Because he's stronger.

387
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,860
Oh, you have some health, friends.

388
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,420
Yeah, he'll be the hero.

389
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,580
I don't know why.

390
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,100
Get Kony's head!

391
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,840
I got you, boy!

392
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,180
Oh, this is the shotgun guy!

393
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,560
Here, I got you a little juice.

394
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,260
I worked very hard for this HP.

395
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,100
Okay, so this guy is the shotgun guy.

396
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,800
Oh, wait, look at that!

397
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,420
This is what that is!

398
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,700
See, I told you!

399
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,180
Our Bidoof is doing it!

400
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,920
Oh my god.

401
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,140
Okay, no game.

402
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay, guys, we got...

403
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,880
It's right here, just put it inside.

404
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,640
Just put it inside.

405
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,620
That works too.

406
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,940
There we go, look at that.

407
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,860
Good job, Bidoof.

408
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,500
Kony is strongest of all.

409
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,060
We found monkey too.

410
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,540
There's like something here.

411
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,660
Man, I heard some screaming coming from that door you just walked through.

412
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,440
Really?

413
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,620
Yeah.

414
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,760
Left or right.

415
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,520
What is the function of this staircase?

416
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,140
There's nothing up here.

417
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,260
Maybe, maybe to avoid monsters.

418
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,320
That's what it has to do.

419
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,240
Oh, I'm rotating.

420
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,800
Guys, I can't stop rotating.

421
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,840
Oh, yeah.

422
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,640
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
Where's the cart?

424
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,920
Follow my voice.

425
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,840
I'm bringing it closer.

426
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,320
You're destroying it.

427
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,800
Let go, let go, let go.

428
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,440
I said let go!

429
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,000
Oh my god!

430
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,200
Minus $7,000.

431
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,260
It's not that easy!

432
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,640
It's not...

433
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,140
Oh no!

434
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,920
Is that a baby?

435
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,200
Dude, you're in the way of the door!

436
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,900
I'm trying...

437
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,200
Why are we always minus a billion dollars?

438
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,040
What's happening here?

439
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,340
Where did the baby go?

440
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,120
There's a monkey chasing us.

441
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,700
Yahoo!

442
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,640
Yes.

443
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,020
Is he still there?

444
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,880
Is he still there?

445
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Why don't you have it?

446
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,380
No, I did!

447
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,660
I thought we bought it.

448
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,200
Oh my god.

449
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,260
That guy was scary.

450
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,100
Are people still alive?

451
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,960
Dude, why did you let go of the music box?

452
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,920
I did!

453
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,560
I did!

454
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,700
The instructions were very unclear.

455
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,740
No, no, no.

456
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,480
You had very unclear instructions.

457
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,420
You had a five second...

458
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,300
I played ping!

459
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:21,980
It was ping.

460
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,280
You didn't account for my ping when you called it.

461
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,600
I had a five second delay.

462
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,720
Oh, okay.

463
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,740
I have 100 ms.

464
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,620
I believe that.

465
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,970
Whenever Kony says what is that thing, I don't...

466
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,510
No!

467
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,710
No!

468
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,130
No!

469
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,130
Wait, where's Tony?

470
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,250
I'm scared.

471
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,490
You had a good look at it there.

472
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,090
Where's your car?

473
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,270
Oh, he sees it now.

474
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,890
We have to put this in the car.

475
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,170
If you don't put this in the car, it's gonna go...

476
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,550
Wait, did you hear that?

477
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,410
Wait, did you hear that?

478
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,150
Yeah, I think that was the cucumber monster they saw.

479
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,210
Wait, what's the cucumber...

480
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,130
What's that?

481
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,470
What is that?

482
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,730
I think two of us are dead.

483
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,930
What was that?

484
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:26,990
I never heard of that.

485
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,730
It's a cucumber.

486
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,790
Oh, do we...

487
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,190
I don't think we're gonna make it past level two.

488
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,410
Level three?

489
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:38,530
Level three?

490
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,050
Guys,

491
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:48,970
I'm afraid.

492
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,310
Wait!

493
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,810
He's breaking everything.

494
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,390
He's breaking all our stuff!

495
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,490
What a dick!

496
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,170
Stop it!

497
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,210
Why is he breaking everything?

498
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,190
He just doesn't like us.

499
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,430
Oh no, I got...

500
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,550
Okay, I'm rotating.

501
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,790
Help!

502
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,770
This might not be a good time to be rotating, Cone.

503
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,040
Oh no, he's still there.

504
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,560
Why won't he leave?

505
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,520
He's a tough one.

506
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,380
Oh my god!

507
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,400
I'm scared.

508
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,960
I mean, I was scared.

509
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,200
I was scared.

510
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,280
I did my signatures.

511
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,220
Oh, Cone is dead.

512
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,300
Cone is dead.

513
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Hey, Cone is dead.

514
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,980
Do you have stuff?

515
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,540
Guys, I got bad news.

516
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,260
Did everything break?

517
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,100
This ghost guy showed up and destroyed us.

518
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,520
Oh my god.

519
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,680
It only has a thousand.

520
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,740
I don't think we're gonna win this round.

521
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,360
No, no, no, we can.

522
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:09,840
We can clutch.

523
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,180
I don't think we have enough, guys.

524
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,180
Is there anything here?

525
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,600
We need like 20k.

526
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,560
Oh no, it's another one.

527
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,440
Guys, I need you guys to tell me when to drop it.

528
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,710
Oh my god.

529
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,190
Wait a second.

530
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,830
I'm struggling on my own.

531
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,910
I have another one too.

532
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:44,690
What the fuck is that?

533
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,130
I don't like this game.

534
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,930
I don't like this game.

535
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,750
I don't like it.

536
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,030
I don't like it.

537
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,510
Is it gone now?

538
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,890
Is it gone?

539
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,930
I think it's gone.

540
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:04,990
Oh my god.

541
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,030
No, it's the infamous clock.

542
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,830
Oh no, it's the fucking clock.

543
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,230
Oh my god.

544
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,370
I'm not getting the clock.

545
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,290
No, I am.

546
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,410
It's the infamous clock.

547
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:26,010
I once had to sit through 30 minutes of someone trying to get the clock and they got lost.

548
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,570
No, not the clock.

549
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,410
I have a froggy.

550
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,410
I mean, we're getting close to the first quota.

551
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,170
Wait, I mean, we already have 9k in there.

552
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,210
Wait, no, wait, oh.

553
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,370
Nevermind.

554
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,310
Wait, no, we got...

555
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,450
Nevermind.

556
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,990
We have a 20k clock.

557
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,810
Yeah, so we gotta rez Cody.

558
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,370
We gotta rez him.

559
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,110
We should slowly push...

560
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,170
Oh my god.

561
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,430
Is that the music box?

562
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,590
Tell me when to drop it.

563
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,830
Drop it.

564
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,690
He's back, he's back, he's back!

565
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,470
He's back!

566
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,690
Oh my god, my money!

567
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,810
Yeah, I don't think we're making this.

568
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,550
I'm not gonna lie.

569
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,050
I don't think we're gonna make quota.

570
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,670
$7,000 left.

571
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:54,230
Okay, let's just grab the TV, the TV must be it.

572
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,350
Yeah.

573
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,090
The TV.

574
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,250
Yeah, the TV's 7k, the TV's 7k!

575
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,910
We can do this!

576
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,450
Okay, now we push the cart back.

577
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,180
Okay, guys.

578
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,060
Guys, okay, okay, guys!

579
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,280
Push the cart back, push it back!

580
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,900
I'll go find the other extraction.

581
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,220
You guys push the cart.

582
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:28,420
Okay, this should be where the extraction is, right?

583
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,800
This seems awfully extraction-y.

584
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,890
Seems awfully extraction-y.

585
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,580
Okay.

586
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,260
Surely I won't die, right?

587
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,220
Surely I'll be safe over here if I look at the floor.

588
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,200
Right, guys?

589
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:10,120
If I'm just here on the floor, surely no one's gonna come over and shake me.

590
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,340
They can't see me, I can't see them.

591
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,530
I believe, I believe in them.

592
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,490
Okay.

593
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,520
Okay, we got the second point.

594
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:42,960
Nice.

595
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,140
Oh, bring the volume a little bit?

596
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,060
Yeah, I can do that.

597
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,720
Alright, let me know if it's better, chat.

598
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,760
Okay.

599
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,440
I'll wait here for them.

600
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,500
I'm a little scared.

601
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,340
I'm a little alone and scared right now.

602
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,740
Just a little guy.

603
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,540
I'll wait until they show up.

604
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,420
They'll show up, right?

605
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,040
Gonna show up, right?

606
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:27,800
Just a little guy, trying to make it in the big scary world.

607
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,840
No, that's a little too scary.

608
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,320
Hahaha.

609
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,790
That's a little too scary.

610
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,670
No way, I'm the only one left.

611
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,770
There's no way.

612
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,170
There's no way.

613
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,190
They'll come back for me.

614
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,750
Yeah?

615
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,030
Think it's nice and safe down this very safe hallway?

616
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,130
Oh, there they are.

617
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,470
Beep beep.

618
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,630
Oh, did you guys got the clock?

619
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,590
We got the fucking piano?

620
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:34,010
Okay, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

621
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,800
Guys, it will be so healthy.

622
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,180
I'll close the door.

623
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,840
We thought you died.

624
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,220
No, no, I found the extraction point for us, remember?

625
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,120
Is it this way?

626
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,020
What's happening to the piano?

627
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,580
Who's rotating?

628
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,900
Right click is rotating, guys.

629
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,720
Obviously, one of you is messing with this.

630
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,920
Someone press right click!

631
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,600
Who's right clicking?

632
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,020
Not me, I don't do that.

633
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,900
Okay, someone's mouse is broken.

634
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,020
Who got the Razer Deathadder?

635
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,840
Who has that?

636
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,000
You mean the most highly rated gaming mouse of 2022?

637
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,260
I cannot believe we met Quota.

638
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,860
Oh my god.

639
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,160
It has to be in or it'll get crushed or it's gonna get crushed or it's gonna get crushed.

640
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,900
You should go in there and hold it.

641
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,080
Yeah, go make sure.

642
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,700
Don't worry, he gets double res.

643
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,120
No, he can get double res.

644
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,860
But he just gets one HP.

645
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,740
Alright, Coney, now it's dark and scary and all the monsters are more aggressive.

646
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,300
We're on.

647
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,340
Monsters?!

648
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,280
Oh, you can press tab.

649
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:55,780
Ouch.

650
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,000
I wish there was a way to defend yourself against them.

651
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,840
Just get high ground.

652
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh, this death!

653
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,560
The ghost!

654
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,560
The thing!

655
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,210
Jesus.

656
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,250
Is it safe?

657
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:36,530
No!

658
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,730
I couldn't see!

659
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,690
Never be a hero.

660
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,710
Never be a hero.

661
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,690
I'm never gonna be a hero again.

662
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:55,350
I literally saw Void's head and I was like, maybe I'll pick him up.

663
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,250
Big mistake.

664
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,490
Should've left him.

665
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,330
I agree.

666
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,270
It's all up to Brawl Pro.

667
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,210
Hiding under the table.

668
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,810
Does Brawl Pro know that he's the only one left?

669
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,970
I don't think he does.

670
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:10,930
There's a chance he does.

671
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,390
I don't think he does.

672
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,090
Are the red dots the homies?

673
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,050
Wait, did they die?

674
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,130
I don't know.

675
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,030
He's putting it together.

676
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,150
He doesn't even know where to go.

677
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,310
He's scared for his life.

678
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,520
This is terrifying.

679
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,240
Oh god!

680
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,060
He can't hear any of this, right?

681
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:03,740
No.

682
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,580
Oh!

683
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,140
He's good!

684
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,240
Oh, he made it!

685
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,520
Oh, he made it!

686
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,260
We did it.

687
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,460
We did it, guys.

688
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,460
We did it.

689
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:39,240
Cause I'm the most important, obviously.

690
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,440
I'm the main character.

691
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,600
I'm literally anime.

692
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,040
More juices, please!

693
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,700
Alright, Bidoof, are you ready for more?

694
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,460
Yes, please.

695
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,600
I'm hungry.

696
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,160
Wait, can I have a real hammer?

697
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,640
Okay, yeah, yeah, you can have a real hammer.

698
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,040
Oh my god, it's 40!

699
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,260
You know you deserve it.

700
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,020
Go, go, go, go, go baby mode.

701
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,280
Oh shit, what's up there?

702
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,620
I'm gonna put you up there.

703
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,480
Go baby mode.

704
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:17,440
Oh yeah, it's cute.

705
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,940
Like a little baby.

706
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,680
No, no, this is up.

707
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,800
You get to go up top.

708
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,340
There you go, there you go, there you go.

709
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,280
Look, Kony, what do you see up there?

710
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,880
I wanna see too.

711
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,840
Take me up there too.

712
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,740
Uppies, uppies.

713
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uppies.

714
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,160
And then...

715
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,940
No!

716
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,780
I'm bad at uppies.

717
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,120
Okay, okay, I'm ready.

718
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,640
I'm ready for uppies round two.

719
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,240
Okay, coming, coming, coming.

720
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,300
Uppies round two.

721
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,500
No!

722
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,320
Kony!

723
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,620
Open it up!

724
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,640
Kony, open it up!

725
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,220
Someone open it, someone open it.

726
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,040
No girls allowed.

727
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:04,800
Wow.

728
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,600
Let me in!

730
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,720
I can't read!

731
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,100
I'm gonna enter anyway because I can't read.

732
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,840
Oh my god!

733
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,760
No!

734
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,280
What's up there?

735
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,280
I can't believe it.

736
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,860
Kony hates women.

737
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,940
Wait, what the fuck?

738
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,520
There's a dead person up here.

739
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,480
What is that?

740
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,980
Oh my god.

741
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,160
Alright, truce, truce, truce, truce.

742
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,120
I should have never shown you that.

743
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,780
A women's history month?

744
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,400
Oh my god!

745
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,340
A women's history month?

746
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,080
A women's month too?

747
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,620
That's fucked.

748
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,640
That's the only women here.

749
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,740
Some enemies.

750
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,540
I can't believe it.

751
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,120
He hates women.

752
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,920
That is true, there is high ground in this game.

753
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,360
Guys, how do we save Doki?

754
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,120
She's dead.

755
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,820
How do we save Doki?

756
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,700
To be clear, I don't know what happened.

757
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,540
I can't lie!

758
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,720
He knew exactly what happened.

759
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,180
I refuse to believe.

760
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,980
I can't believe it.

761
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,900
A women's month too?

762
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,760
Kony, that's fucked.

763
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:51,120
That's the only women here.

764
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,560
No health.

765
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,080
No health.

766
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,000
No health.

767
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:58,520
No health.

768
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,460
$30,000 for that?

769
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Alright Bidoof, eat your snacks.

770
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,820
Yummy yummy.

771
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,300
Yummy yummy.

772
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,520
I am so strong.

773
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,540
I can't believe it.

774
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,740
How much HP do you have Kony?

775
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,060
Okay, get the big one.

776
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,540
Okay, never mind.

777
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,640
I'll get the big one too.

778
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,760
Oh, no, no, no, I get the big one.

779
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,820
No, you can't.

780
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,740
That's you giving.

781
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,200
Yeah, I have to give you.

782
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,120
What's your HP, Coney?

783
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,400
Yeah, what's your HP?

784
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,220
What's your HP?

785
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,340
Why are you...

786
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,540
Yeah, I was like, what are you doing?

787
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,980
Oh my god, wait, we have one more upgrade.

788
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,280
Oh, no!

789
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,180
Who's throwing?

790
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,320
Not me, though.

791
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:57,640
It wasn't...

792
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,580
Brofo, was it you?

793
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,500
Wait, wait, wait, Coney!

794
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,760
Coney, we have more!

795
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,940
Eat your, eat your, eat your veggies!

796
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,320
Okay, put it down.

797
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:11,800
I'll eat it.

798
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,800
Eat your veggies, Badoof.

799
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
Look how fast I am, ready?

800
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,780
Wait, wait, I need to give you HP!

801
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,600
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

802
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,360
Coney, you gotta get to use!

803
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,160
Coney, you gotta waste your upgrades!

804
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,660
Okay, what?

805
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,280
What happened?

806
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,540
I need to give you an extra.

807
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,440
There you go.

808
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,380
Oh, yeah, please.

809
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,180
Thank you.

810
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,020
Hey, what are the question marks on the map?

811
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,680
It means we haven't been there yet.

812
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,440
Oh my god, oh my god, guys!

813
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,300
23k!

814
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,120
Coney!

815
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,740
Get up, Badoof, here!

816
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,860
There's a 23k here!

817
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,520
The yellows.

818
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,800
There's another big thing, too.

819
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,620
Coney, Coney, we need you!

820
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,840
Coney, we have a 23k here.

821
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,460
We need you to use your strength.

822
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,580
There's 50k of things in here.

823
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,020
Use your strength, Coney.

824
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,700
Coney, use strength.

825
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,180
I will.

826
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,960
I'll be the strongest of all.

827
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,380
Use rock smash.

828
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,660
Is that gonna fit through the door?

829
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,600
Minus 1000, minus 200.

830
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,640
Oh, there's there's three, three extraction points.

831
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,140
That's scary.

832
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,060
Oh, I don't like this area.

833
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,860
This might be where the clown lives.

834
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,680
I think we get the clown here.

835
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,600
Clown man.

836
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,780
Clown man!

837
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,200
I'd probably die to the clown.

838
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:36,740
Oh!

839
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,500
Oh, we already got the first one.

840
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,540
This looks like a scary place.

841
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:50,860
Oh!

842
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,220
I don't like that.

843
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:02,350
I don't like this.

844
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,670
I don't like this area.

845
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:06,650
Oh, a soda?

846
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,830
That's a vending machine.

847
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:09,870
Wait, is this an extraction?

848
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,990
Oh, I guess we'll never know.

849
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,730
Oh, the music got a little scary.

850
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,350
A little freaky.

851
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,090
Wait, is that it?

852
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,370
Is it just one item or two items?

853
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,330
I think so.

854
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,310
Wait, it's just two items.

855
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,050
That's so cheap.

856
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,180
I don't like this.

857
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,280
It's getting freaky.

858
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,600
I don't like this.

859
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,380
I don't like the freakiness.

860
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,660
I have a plate.

861
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,540
Where are the others?

862
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,680
Are you guys okay over there?

863
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,800
Jokey, jokey, you have to hide.

864
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,020
What is that?

865
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,360
Puppies!

866
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,180
Don't pick on me.

867
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,660
I can't pick you up.

868
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,420
Okay, I touched it.

869
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,840
I didn't know you could touch them.

870
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,700
Oh my god!

871
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,440
What's going on over there?

872
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,800
Matt, do you gotta hide maybe?

873
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,300
I don't know.

874
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,900
Who had the sledgehammer?

875
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,520
It's just trying to swipe at you.

876
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,020
Somebody had the sledgehammer!

877
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,700
It's like over there.

878
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,660
I'm just avoiding you.

879
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,820
Jokey will be fine.

880
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,340
I'm gonna look this way.

881
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,120
Wait.

882
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,640
Don't leave me, man.

883
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,560
Come on.

884
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,180
Boop.

885
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,260
Boop.

886
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,420
Oh my god.

887
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,320
I got babied.

888
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,460
I am fucking Slenderman.

889
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,280
Oh no.

890
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,180
I got a loser Bidoof.

891
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,560
Oh my god.

892
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,040
Is there fall damage?

893
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,820
Uh, no.

894
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:52,680
Okay.

895
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,140
Lies to you like a boss.

896
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,600
I'm kidding.

897
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,600
There's no fall damage.

898
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,140
I don't remember.

899
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,020
Oh, there is it.

900
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,400
I'm scared of the doll.

901
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,080
Yeah, she's actually pretty scary.

902
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,870
It looks like someone's bringing something.

903
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,310
Like we're about to run into someone.

904
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:13,750
Hello?

905
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,670
I'm scared.

906
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,410
Oh!

907
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:29,170
I am strong.

908
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,940
Oh no.

909
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,560
Wait, we hit quota?

910
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:38,980
Holy.

911
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:39,920
We're gaming.

912
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,140
They don't know.

913
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,020
They don't know, guys.

914
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,400
If they didn't see it, it never happened.

915
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,410
Die, die.

916
00:52:59,450 --> 00:52:59,870
Diamond.

917
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:07,230
This is the pain.

918
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:08,750
Oh god.

919
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,470
Oh god.

920
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,930
Guys, I have...

921
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,450
There's several items down here.

922
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:15,290
I need help.

923
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,110
I'm coming down.

924
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,350
I have a diamond.

925
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,970
Oh my god, man.

926
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,350
Oh my god.

927
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,130
Where's the last extra?

928
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:31,690
Oh!

929
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,330
Oh, fuck!

930
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,430
I'm 80 HP!

931
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,170
Cody, we're gonna fucking die.

932
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,890
Oh, that was awesome.

933
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,050
There was a 20,000 server thing.

934
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,250
Watch the merchandise.

935
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,110
We're gonna find the last extraction point.

936
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,950
We haven't found the last one.

937
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,910
You're right.

938
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,610
I don't know where it is.

939
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:05,550
Is it over there?

940
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,110
Yeah, we haven't gone all the way forward.

941
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,470
Oh, I found it.

942
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,030
I found it.

943
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:13,790
It's all the way here.

944
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,330
I found a point.

945
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,330
Wait, we did it.

946
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,670
We have enough money.

947
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:18,930
Already?

948
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:19,750
Yeah.

949
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,570
It's 15k.

950
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,530
We have 15k.

951
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:24,950
Or 22k.

952
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,470
Alright, we gotta get past the doll, though.

953
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:29,710
If I get the fan and push people off...

954
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,150
Wait, I have an extra play.

955
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,610
I have a 2.7k play.

956
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:34,550
We have one thing.

957
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:38,330
Alright, Cody, I have a very serious question for you.

958
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:40,650
Alright, forget passing.

959
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,090
I have a very serious question.

960
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:47,870
I noticed in your top games of 2023 and 2024 there was no mention of Resident Evil 4 Remake.

961
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:48,970
Have you never played that game?

962
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:49,970
That bothers me to this day.

963
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:51,070
No, it was good.

964
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:51,770
It was pretty good.

965
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,750
Okay, I just needed clarification.

966
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,070
Because I was like, there's no way you've never played Resident Evil 4.

967
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,230
No, you don't play games?

968
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,330
Yes, okay.

969
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:04,830
Cody doesn't play games.

970
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,270
He only reacts to TikToks.

971
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,430
Nice.

972
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:08,370
And videos.

973
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:11,090
It's crazy.

974
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,110
She is 19 years old.

975
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,070
That is unbelievable.

976
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,650
Are we good?

977
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:16,130
That is amazing.

978
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:19,990
That's crazy.

979
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,510
We all just casually walked away from the extraction point.

980
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,910
Why did nobody hit the extraction point?

981
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,830
I will do it.

982
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,090
She's doing it.

983
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:30,850
Wait.

984
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:31,550
Oh.

985
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,010
We're good.

986
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,350
Now we gotta get back, right?

987
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

988
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:56,830
I don't know.

989
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,430
But it's a scary boy.

990
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:01,650
It's the boy.

991
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,410
It's the Marshmallow Man.

992
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,070
It's the Ghostbusters.

993
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,250
Oh my god, I see it.

994
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:11,290
I see the scary boy.

995
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,250
You see what, Cody?

996
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,890
The scary boy.

997
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,930
Oh, I thought there wasn't a scary boy.

998
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,190
No, there really is.

999
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:19,430
He's pretty scary.

1000
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,130
He's pretty scary.

1001
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,170
Why is it like right here?

1002
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,570
Like it actually knows we're here.

1003
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,770
Because the monsters attract sound.

1004
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:30,190
Oh, we're moving right now.

1005
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:30,450
It's good to go.

1006
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:30,950
Leave right now.

1007
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:31,990
Yeah.

1008
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,050
It's good to go.

1009
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:35,650
It's good to go.

1010
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:36,350
It's good?

1011
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:36,870
Keep going?

1012
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:37,930
Yeah, you guys got it.

1013
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,050
No, no, no.

1014
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,230
I promise it's safe.

1015
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,030
What is that?

1016
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:46,910
Oh, he said...

1017
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,840
He's gone.

1018
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,150
Why are you staring at it?

1019
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,130
He's right there!

1020
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,390
Okay, he's not even chasing us.

1021
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,270
Do I have to go up?

1022
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:29,730
I didn't know that.

1023
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,460
Ew.

1024
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,520
He's right there.

1025
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,720
We're safe though.

1026
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,600
He doesn't see me.

1027
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:44,580
Hello?

1028
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,580
Oh, monsters in there.

1029
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:48,700
Okay.

1030
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,940
You know the monsters are attracted by sound, right?

1031
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:53,440
Hello?

1032
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,760
This way they get away from you guys, you know?

1033
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,500
Who else is alive in this hallway?

1034
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,600
Oh, everyone.

1035
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,200
Cool.

1036
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,840
We made it.

1037
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,540
We did it.

1038
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,620
We all made it.

1039
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,700
Let's go.

1040
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,020
Gaming.

1041
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,800
For some reason, we can still work together.

1042
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,760
For some reason.

1043
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,080
More upgrades, please.

1044
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,540
Yes, feed.

1045
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:27,860
Feed Coney.

1046
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,580
Our strat is to feed Coney.

1047
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,120
Veggie time.

1048
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,900
More strength, please.

1049
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:34,940
Got you, strength.

1050
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,840
There's a giant baseball bat here if you want this.

1051
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,680
Oh, what?

1052
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,020
Wait, that's pretty good.

1053
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,140
We gotta give him stamina upgrade.

1054
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,140
I would like speed.

1055
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,360
I want speed, dude.

1056
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,740
Speed is... I'm very fast.

1057
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,600
Aren't you already really fast?

1058
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,080
Oh my god.

1059
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,240
Don't step on that, Coney.

1060
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,120
He's becoming self-aware.

1061
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,900
He knows what he wants now.

1062
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,500
Oh, shit.

1063
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,460
That's what he wants.

1064
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,540
Wait, should we get health?

1065
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,720
Actually, wait a minute.

1066
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,660
I just realized we might need HP.

1067
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,780
I'll get rid of...

1068
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,640
We all lived, right?

1069
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:16,940
I have 33 HP.

1070
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,160
What are you doing?

1071
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,320
I have 33 HP.

1072
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,520
I think that's good.

1073
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:30,590
Alright, gotta get those electrolytes in our system.

1074
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,370
Welcome back.

1075
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,530
Alright, let's go!

1076
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:38,650
Level 5!

1077
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,110
Does your kid watch TikToks?

1078
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:51,130
No!

1079
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,690
I love my kid.

1080
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,690
I'm not letting her do that.

1081
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:58,470
Can I have the health?

1082
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,070
I need health.

1083
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,090
Shall we?

1084
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,130
Just take everything.

1085
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,790
Eat up, Coney.

1086
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,150
Become big and strong.

1087
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,150
I have 3 strength.

1088
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,170
Oh my god, he's so fast.

1089
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,570
I got the zoobies!

1090
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,760
Alright, headman Manny.

1091
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,580
Wait, this is the shotgun map, right?

1092
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,420
Shotgun map?

1093
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,600
You said that last time.

1094
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,380
No, this one, for real, is the guy with the shotgun.

1095
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,180
He reacts to sound.

1096
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,680
Oh, the enemy has a shotgun?

1097
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah, so enemy one-shots you.

1098
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,020
Like, pause in my mic?

1099
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,140
Yeah.

1100
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,100
Anything up here?

1101
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,700
There's like, several floors now.

1102
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,720
Guys, I have...

1103
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,580
There's several stuff upstairs.

1104
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,040
Okay.

1105
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,080
Woah!

1106
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,480
It's bouncing around!

1107
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,920
I hope, like, the strat of giving...

1108
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,160
pumping Coney with as many...

1109
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,360
with as many steroids as possible works out for us.

1110
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,460
Put him in the cart.

1111
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,320
I hope.

1112
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,340
I hope the strat would work out.

1113
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,760
There's one here.

1114
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:46,330
Alright, I got the compass.

1115
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,750
Coney is the ADC.

1116
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,160
Is it actually working now?

1117
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,220
I can't tell.

1118
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,640
Wait, what's inside there?

1119
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,560
You dropped something.

1120
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,600
Well, I got it.

1121
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,700
Ooh, I'm risking it all.

1122
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:18,940
For a shortcut.

1123
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:26,460
It's 8k.

1124
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,480
Wait, we have enough.

1125
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,300
No, wait, I can't math.

1126
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,240
We need, like, one more item.

1127
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:35,560
Somebody's dead.

1128
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:35,660
What?

1129
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,520
Somebody's dead.

1130
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,120
Already?

1131
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:38,940
How do you know?

1132
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,160
Is that their head?

1133
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:41,540
You can see the red dot, yeah.

1134
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:41,700
Oh!

1135
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,980
I think they fell into the hole.

1136
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,040
Oh!

1137
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,800
Did you guys kill them?

1138
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,900
Did you throw his head in there?

1139
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,160
He threw his head in there!

1140
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,540
He said Coney wasn't strongest of all.

1141
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,540
I had to correct him.

1142
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,380
Alright, I got him.

1143
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,160
Put him in the cart.

1144
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,940
What do you mean you had to correct him?

1145
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,220
What did you do?

1146
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,840
He said I wasn't the strongest.

1147
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,480
What did you do?

1148
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,840
What does that mean?

1149
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,180
Oh, we need 200.

1150
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,060
Oh, that should be enough.

1151
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,720
It wasn't.

1152
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,540
He needs correction.

1153
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,400
Alright, you can handle the cart.

1154
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,300
Or do something super risky.

1155
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:40,780
What

1156
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:53,990
are you doing?

1157
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,150
What are you doing?

1158
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,190
We're in this together, what are you doing?

1159
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:58,270
What are you doing?

1160
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,670
No, he tried to kill me.

1161
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,250
So now I'm doing this.

1162
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,810
We violated the social contract.

1163
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:05,570
There it goes.

1164
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,050
I picked it up.

1165
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:10,710
Just get the doll to make up for it.

1166
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:11,790
It's right there.

1167
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,370
Get the doll.

1168
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:15,250
Minus $7,000.

1169
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:18,130
Because...

1170
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:21,630
Oh, not the clock.

1171
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,890
Where are you even taking it?

1172
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,590
We're done with it.

1173
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:30,690
Don't drop it.

1174
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,710
I'm holding on.

1175
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:33,370
I'm holding on.

1176
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:38,990
Kony, are you actually the strongest of them all?

1177
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,830
I'm the strongest of all.

1178
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:41,990
You're really the strongest.

1179
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:43,150
Drive me a little cart.

1180
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,090
Long live the king.

1181
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,430
Long live the king.

1182
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:01,130
You truly was the strongest of them all.

1183
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:04,010
I like how the skin's spinning out of his head.

1184
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:09,690
When will we get the head back?

1185
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:13,130
Alright, so...

1186
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,470
Oh, there we go.

1187
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:15,210
There's the head.

1188
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,170
I see the head.

1189
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,390
Where did it go?

1190
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,970
It flew so far, I don't even know where it flew to.

1191
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,910
It's over here.

1192
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:27,550
He said he was the strongest of them all.

1193
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,830
Clearly, he was wrong.

1194
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:34,250
I got the extraction.

1195
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:34,830
Go ahead.

1196
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:37,670
Yeah, there's one down there.

1197
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:40,550
Do you have the doll up there?

1198
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:42,470
Yeah, but the doll's almost dead.

1199
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:44,950
Guys, we don't have our Bidoof anymore, by the way.

1200
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,970
I threw him out into the pasture.

1201
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,070
We need the cart for the doll, doke.

1202
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:54,610
Our Bidoof is gone.

1203
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,750
I don't know what to do.

1204
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:57,830
I don't know what happened to him.

1205
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:07,910
If he was so strong, why is he dead?

1206
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:10,070
Exactly.

1207
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:13,970
I think someone that strong would never die.

1208
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,130
The doll...

1209
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:18,010
What is that noise and why?

1210
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,490
Bye-bye.

1211
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:19,190
What is that noise?

1212
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:19,690
I don't know.

1213
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:36,590
I was like, tell me you didn't die to that.

1214
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,590
I was just praying.

1215
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:43,750
If strong, why dead?

1216
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:44,790
Exactly.

1217
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:46,450
That's my philosophy.

1218
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,590
Can't be the strongest if he's dead.

1219
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:51,990
Oh my god, sorry.

1220
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:53,950
Where's the cart?

1221
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,110
Right here, right here, right here.

1222
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:57,670
Oh, there it is.

1223
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,030
We got some stuff to explore.

1224
01:06:59,170 --> 01:06:59,470
Hold on.

1225
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,410
There's hope.

1226
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:02,750
We're close.

1227
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:07,430
There's a diamond?

1228
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,390
Oh, it's not worth that much.

1229
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:11,830
Oh, there's the big boy.

1230
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:14,530
Are you strong enough solo?

1231
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:15,690
No.

1232
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:17,530
There you are.

1233
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:18,110
You can do it.

1234
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:18,870
Oh my god.

1235
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:21,070
Long live the king.

1236
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,530
Oops.

1237
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:23,610
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1238
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:25,970
Don't use the tree alive, I'm not even kidding.

1239
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:29,670
I think it's a sandbar.

1240
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,130
Have you played Monster Hunter?

1241
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,990
He's like the conga lala.

1242
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,490
He is actually the conga lala.

1243
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,330
He's like the conga lala.

1244
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,610
Okay, move it, move it.

1245
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,190
Move the cart to the first extraction.

1246
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,770
The second one, to the second extraction.

1247
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,540
Can we close the door?

1248
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,100
He's gonna open it.

1249
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:07,250
I'll keep looking for more stuff.

1250
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:08,270
Wait, is it 15k?

1251
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:09,830
How much do we have?

1252
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:11,450
Oh, we got enough.

1253
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,170
We literally just got enough.

1254
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,410
I hope I don't drop it.

1255
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,730
Yeah, I'm watching you right now, Void.

1256
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:21,970
I'm watching you.

1257
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,370
We have only...

1258
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:26,470
If you drop it, it's you.

1259
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:27,490
You fucked us over.

1260
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:29,390
It's true.

1261
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:31,110
You were the one that fucked us over.

1262
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:32,530
You drop it right now.

1263
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:36,110
And Kony would have to wait just a little longer.

1264
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:37,750
Oh, really?

1265
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:42,950
I think Matt caught COVID or something up there.

1266
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:51,310
Kony's gonna remember that he's spectating us right now.

1267
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:57,110
What are we laughing about?

1268
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:57,950
What happened?

1269
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:00,930
Our $1.

1270
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:02,630
It's okay, Kony.

1271
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:03,670
Welcome back.

1272
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:06,850
I thought we were over by $1.

1273
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:09,890
Is this all $1?

1274
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,630
Kony, do you think you're still the strongest of them all?

1275
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,710
Nobody is strong without friends.

1276
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:17,910
That's what I've come to learn.

1277
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,570
Over the course of my...

1278
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,950
Friendship is the strongest thing.

1279
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,550
How much HP do you have, Kony?

1280
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,430
The power of friendship, everybody.

1281
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,530
I have 1 HP.

1282
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:30,910
I can give you some.

1283
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:32,190
Yeah, do that.

1284
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:35,070
With the power of friendship, we prevail.

1285
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,570
Bro said some and gave me 10.

1286
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:39,490
Thank you.

1287
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,530
Thank you, man.

1288
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,050
What do I look like with 10?

1289
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:45,830
Ah, what is that?

1290
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:46,390
What is that?

1291
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,030
You wanna find out?

1292
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,070
I think he's trying to...

1293
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:53,450
I think he wants the dollar, guys.

1294
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:54,510
That $1?

1295
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,170
Our $1.

1296
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:57,230
I think he wants the dollar.

1297
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,530
Give him a dollar!

1298
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,910
That's a Soul Calibur character.

1299
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,790
Who is that?

1300
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,110
The survivor.

1301
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:08,370
She's like blocking us.

1302
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,250
The extraction is literally right there.

1303
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:12,650
Oh, it's a girl?

1304
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:14,050
I don't know.

1305
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,810
She's thick as hell.

1306
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,450
She heard you.

1307
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:23,590
That's a compliment!

1308
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:25,410
Ladies night!

1309
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:26,110
Ladies night!

1310
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:29,190
Oh, bangers, bangers, bangers.

1311
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:30,390
What?

1312
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,610
What are those?

1313
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:34,610
I went the wrong way.

1314
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,350
Why did we leave the cart in front?

1315
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,440
Oh, what happened?

1316
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,560
Who exploded?

1317
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,500
Oh, we're about to lose our $1.

1318
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,560
We had nothing in there.

1319
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:55,180
We had one full dollar.

1320
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,180
Why did I just take damage?

1321
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,000
What are you doing?

1322
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:17,240
Don't throw me out there.

1323
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,700
I didn't do anything.

1324
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,590
I don't trust Doki.

1325
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,370
Oh my god!

1326
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:44,150
It sucked me up!

1327
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:44,810
What?

1328
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,850
It pulls me closer!

1329
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:56,530
I didn't think he'd pull me closer!

1330
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,330
What?

1331
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:07,630
How did it hit me and not him?

1332
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,750
That's not fair!

1333
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,430
I didn't deserve that.

1334
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:16,190
I did so much for this team.

1335
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:17,830
I didn't deserve that.

1336
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:22,950
You even complimented her and everything.

1337
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,810
I called her thick as hell.

1338
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,150
It was a compliment.

1339
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,190
I can't believe it.

1340
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,870
She doesn't appreciate me.

1341
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,350
A fellow woman.

1342
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,370
Maybe she didn't like that.

1343
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,350
It's a compliment!

1344
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,490
Come here, boy!

1345
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:47,850
Come here,

1346
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:51,910
boy!

1347
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:55,350
Women against women.

1348
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,870
We need to stick together!

1349
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:59,870
As fellow women!

1350
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,770
We gotta work together!

1351
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:05,210
A women month!

1352
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:12,550
Let's watch Kony.

1353
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:14,330
Our fellow Bidoof.

1354
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,410
Is our Bidoof doing okay?

1355
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,530
I can't believe it.

1356
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,270
I worked so hard.

1357
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,490
Oh my god, he's so strong.

1358
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,430
He just lifts it like that.

1359
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,790
What's our Bidoof doing?

1360
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:36,110
What's our Bidoof doing right now?

1361
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,330
I can't believe it.

1362
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:45,410
I bet she was a pick me woman too.

1363
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,230
She was a pick me girl.

1364
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:50,850
She didn't like that I was also hanging out with the bros.

1365
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:53,130
She was like, only me.

1366
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:54,790
Can't believe it.

1367
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:56,750
We were supposed to be working together.

1368
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,390
A group can have two women!

1369
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,310
A group doesn't need one woman!

1370
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:11,570
It can have two!

1371
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,090
Maybe three women!

1372
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:16,990
Possibilities are endless!

1373
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:34,690
It does not have to be like the Smurf village!

1374
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:37,970
We can all be Smurfette!

1375
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,970
We can all be Amy!

1376
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,350
They didn't even grab my head!

1377
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:47,930
Oh no, I'm alive.

1378
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,450
Oh my god, okay, I'm alive.

1379
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,050
Does anyone have any HP to spare?

1380
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,410
I'm like 1 HP.

1381
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:07,890
There's the goose lady.

1382
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:09,410
Put that down!

1383
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,810
Goose lady!

1384
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:14,590
Oh shit!

1385
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,200
One of us are dead.

1386
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,160
Two of us are dead.

1387
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:30,800
Ow!

1388
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,340
Sorry.

1389
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,470
Oh god.

1390
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,560
What are you running from?

1391
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,240
What do you think I'm running from?

1392
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,220
What do you think?

1393
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,880
There's 20 things down there!

1394
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,940
You can toss them.

1395
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,340
I'm okay.

1396
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,200
I'll go forward then.

1397
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:31,270
Oh my god, I got jumpscared by myself.

1398
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,610
Get away from me!

1399
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:56,730
You're gonna throw up on me!

1400
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,000
Oh my god.

1401
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,680
What the fuck?

1402
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,350
Get away!

1403
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,100
Bro, I can't.

1404
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,000
I can't.

1405
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:37,560
I don't know.

1406
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,340
Bro, what are you talking about?

1407
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,360
He's in the way!

1408
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,680
The thing is up here blocking the way.

1409
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,740
Get away from

1410
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:35,130
me!

1411
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:38,530
It won't fall into the thing, bro.

1412
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:39,330
Move!

1413
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:44,730
Oh!

1414
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:45,870
It might be over!

1415
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:46,810
No!

1416
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:48,150
No!

1417
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:49,550
No!

1418
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:53,750
Get away!

1419
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:58,530
Oh my god!

1420
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:00,750
We're getting blocked by that thing!

1421
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,250
We can't go that way.

1422
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:06,370
Get away!

1423
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:09,110
Watch out behind you, doggy.

1424
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:10,910
There's a guy.

1425
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:12,850
Is there another way to get over there?

1426
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:41,590
Are you fucking kidding me?

1427
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:45,900
No!

1428
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:47,260
Get away from me!

1429
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,100
Get away!

1430
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,610
Oh my god!

1431
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:16,070
Oh my god!

1432
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:18,550
I'm sorry, bro.

1433
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:20,070
I'm sorry.

1434
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:22,610
I'm sorry.

1435
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,050
I can't.

1436
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:35,610
I can't make it.

1437
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:37,770
Oh, you made it!

1438
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:39,250
Oh my god.

1439
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,830
You made it!

1440
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:41,850
Oh my god.

1441
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,050
Oh my god.

1442
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,190
Oh my god!

1443
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:48,150
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1444
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:50,010
You were holding my head!

1445
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,090
Listen.

1446
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:54,790
Listen.

1447
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:57,130
Why did you not do it?

1448
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:57,850
You dropped the head!

1449
01:21:58,690 --> 01:21:59,910
I didn't think...

1450
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:08,730
That was for the clock, Cody.

1451
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:10,130
That was for the clock, man.

1452
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,270
You had three seconds!

1453
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:18,670
I want my juicies!

1454
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:20,530
I want my juicies!

1455
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,750
I want juicies.

1456
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:23,630
That'll help me feel better.

1457
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:24,970
I want one apple.

1458
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:27,370
We need a health pack.

1459
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:29,150
We're so fucking low.

1460
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,190
Give me my juice.

1461
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,530
Yeah, health pack, too.

1462
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,130
For me.

1463
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:39,010
And then we can buy another health pack.

1464
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:40,490
We'll buy a mini one.

1465
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:42,210
I can't believe we lived.

1466
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:45,090
I can't believe we lived that.

1467
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,200
Alright, that should be enough.

1468
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:52,940
Are you picking the hammer?

1469
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,260
We have zero funds.

1470
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,060
Let's go!

1471
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,560
Okay, I hope that's worth it.

1472
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,080
Oh, there he is.

1473
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:08,860
Is Void okay?

1474
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,140
Is he traumatized?

1475
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,240
Is he okay?

1476
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,880
Is he okay?

1477
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,080
I don't think he's okay.

1478
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,660
He's just sitting in the corner.

1479
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,240
By himself.

1480
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,120
He looks like he's seen things.

1481
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,780
Eat up and be a big strong boy.

1482
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:36,960
Look how fast I am.

1483
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,760
Give some HP.

1484
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,300
That's not even fair.

1485
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,200
That's our Bidoof.

1486
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,660
I can't even track that.

1487
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,840
Give some HP.

1488
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,160
Give some HP.

1489
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,140
Give it to Void and Matt.

1490
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:53,620
I got 29.

1491
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,260
You have plenty.

1492
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,180
Give some to Matt.

1493
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:03,140
I don't like this.

1494
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,600
Now you understand why I was in trouble.

1495
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:09,680
There's nothing explicitly bad, but it's just weird.

1496
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:13,040
Alright, Kony, here's your fucking 12k hammer that you bought.

1497
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:13,520
Yay!

1498
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,080
I got my prize!

1499
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:19,380
We could have had a health pack, but you bought a fucking hammer.

1500
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:21,860
I did so good.

1501
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:25,240
I did so good.

1502
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,040
I deserve it.

1503
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,240
Guys,

1504
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:31,920
what house are you in?

1505
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,180
I'm a Gryffindor.

1506
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,180
Yeah, I'm a Gryffindor too.

1507
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,760
You would be a Hufflepuff, so true.

1508
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:44,180
Oh, this is actually very Harry Potter-like.

1509
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,580
Oh wait, there's the potions.

1510
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,800
Oh, I can put it in my inventory.

1511
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,460
Thank you, chat.

1512
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:49,600
A check!

1513
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,780
Wait, does it do damage when you stand in there?

1514
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,340
Wait!

1515
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,040
Kony!

1516
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,140
Kony, get over here!

1517
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,320
What is he doing?

1518
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:03,760
Kony, get over here!

1519
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,600
I think he's dead.

1520
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,140
Get this cube.

1521
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,440
We have another mega cube here too.

1522
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,820
You guys don't need a third, I just want to do something.

1523
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,800
Wait, Kony, we need you to do this too.

1524
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:28,080
Okay, I'll do it too, don't worry.

1525
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:30,060
Wait, where did Void go?

1526
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:34,540
Oh, you can just bring it to the thingy.

1527
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,540
Yeah, that's 20k.

1528
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,220
Wait, did he actually die?

1529
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,600
Yes, he stood in this.

1530
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:44,760
And then he exploded.

1531
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,860
There's a clown.

1532
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:48,040
There's a clown.

1533
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:49,760
That's just Kony.

1534
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,000
Is it Harry Potter?

1535
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,500
There's a clown.

1536
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,280
Oh, it is a clown!

1537
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,940
I don't like that.

1538
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,220
Oh god.

1539
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,080
Beat his ass, Kony, don't worry.

1540
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,180
Wait, he's alive!

1541
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,820
He's coming, he's coming.

1542
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,860
Let him round this corner.

1543
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,160
Wait for him to round this corner.

1544
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:15,660
No, he left.

1545
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,240
He left, he left.

1546
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:18,600
He knows.

1547
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,880
Just Tom and Jerry shit.

1548
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,280
He's coming back, he's coming back!

1549
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,960
Why did you hit me?

1550
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,080
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1551
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:29,860
Thanks, thanks.

1552
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:32,120
I'll give him one of these.

1553
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,600
One of these.

1554
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:35,920
Can I rotate it?

1555
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:37,060
I don't know.

1556
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:38,300
Right click, yeah.

1557
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:42,920
Yeah, we're loony tuning this shit right now.

1558
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,280
I got my card right here.

1559
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,860
I don't know if that's gonna do any damage, Kony.

1560
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:48,780
It's like...

1561
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,160
It costs 12k!

1562
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,940
It's more expensive than a fucking health pack!

1563
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,700
I'm going this way, guys.

1564
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:01,580
See you later.

1565
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:03,640
Sayonara.

1566
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,960
Wait, what the fuck was that?

1567
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,560
I had a peepee head.

1568
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,440
There's something in front of us.

1569
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:21,990
What the fuck was that?

1570
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:24,030
There was a peepee head in front of us.

1571
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:43,760
How much money do we have in there?

1572
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,680
Oh, it's just 9k.

1573
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:56,050
There's a peepee head alien in front of us.

1574
01:27:56,050 --> 01:27:57,290
Oh, there's a life potion.

1575
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:07,820
Kony, don't look behind you.

1576
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,140
Kony got you, kid.

1577
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:29,500
I was trying to save him.

1578
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,920
Did he get you killed?

1579
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:33,920
Oh,

1580
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:39,480
no.

1581
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,260
He doesn't know what to do.

1582
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:45,540
Kony, there's two clowns.

1583
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,660
Wait, there's two?

1584
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,480
There's two.

1585
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:52,660
I think we fucked up by not buying any guns.

1586
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,760
I think we fucked up.

1587
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,240
It's okay, we have a hammer.

1588
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:58,420
We have a 12k hammer.

1589
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:01,120
Money well spent.

1590
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,220
Where are the others?

1591
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,920
What kind of fucking adventure are they doing?

1592
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,940
They're having a grand old time.

1593
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,500
Oh, no.

1594
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,900
The two people that are actually doing anything are dead.

1595
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,300
I'm saying...

1596
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:20,520
that we have our Bidoof.

1597
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,800
It's okay.

1598
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,040
We have our Bidoof.

1599
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,260
It's a playable hammer.

1600
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,120
It's okay.

1601
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:35,840
The perfect weapon for our maxed out, roided Bidoof.

1602
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,720
I believe in Kony.

1603
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:46,120
Wait, he didn't pick up my head.

1604
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,320
Oh my god.

1605
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,580
I think Brawpro doesn't know how to res you.

1606
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,300
He put you in the recharge station.

1607
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,980
Why did he put me in the recharge station?

1608
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:59,740
Somebody go to Brawpro chat right now and tell them to put me in the other extraction.

1609
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:01,820
Someone tell him.

1610
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,820
Someone tell him to put me in.

1611
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:09,200
Don't let him do this to me.

1612
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:12,580
Okay, okay.

1613
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,200
He figured it out.

1614
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,240
Big fucking guy.

1615
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,300
He fucking figured it out.

1616
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,680
Don't worry.

1617
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:24,980
He's not that clumsy.

1618
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,240
He literally just need $200.

1619
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:29,580
We got it.

1620
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,860
I believe.

1621
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,580
Why did he get us?

1622
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,400
You're racist.

1623
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,520
I blame Kony.

1624
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:40,800
I blame Kony too.

1625
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,320
100%.

1626
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,280
It wasn't our fault.

1627
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,200
Yeah, we were there to protect him.

1628
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:50,360
He was literally right in front of them and yet it kills you and me?

1629
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,920
I blame my Bidoof.

1630
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,200
Yeah, we should've got Zigzagoon.

1631
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:02,800
Oh true.

1632
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,360
We got a fucking Bidoof.

1633
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,800
It's gonna evolve into something ugly like Bibera.

1634
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,200
Yeah.

1635
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,740
At least he's eradicated.

1636
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,980
And what's the other one?

1637
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:15,540
Limune?

1638
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,800
You guys only like Bidoof ironically.

1639
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:31,400
You guys don't actually like Bidoof.

1640
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,700
Look at what Bidoof just did.

1641
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:35,680
Look at what he did.

1642
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,280
Are you still gonna defend our Bidoof?

1643
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:39,720
Look at this guy.

1644
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,360
Oh my god, dude.

1645
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,340
That just broke the vase.

1646
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,540
It was like $6,000.

1647
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:45,620
He dropped it.

1648
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:46,260
Oh, a gnome!

1649
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:48,540
Is that a duck?

1650
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:49,660
That's a bad guy!

1651
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,140
No way!

1652
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,060
He has an inflatable hammer.

1653
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,360
He's gonna get the gnome.

1654
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:07,180
Liz, you just need $200!

1655
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,140
How hard is it to find $200?

1656
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,520
The economy right now is kinda grim.

1657
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,300
I believe in him.

1658
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,280
I believe in him.

1659
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,800
He has

1660
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:40,180
a party.

1661
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,720
He has a party of gnomes.

1662
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:43,600
Look at him.

1663
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,840
I'm gonna release this Bidoof into the wilds.

1664
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,380
Oh, nice.

1665
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,540
They're actually just climbing.

1666
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,220
Wait, did they take my hammer?

1667
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,460
My hammer's gone!

1668
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:58,400
Coney.

1669
01:32:59,360 --> 01:32:59,960
Coney!

1670
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:05,140
Dude,

1671
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:15,470
he took my stuff!

1672
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:21,630
Oh my god!

1673
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:22,950
Are you serious?

1674
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:24,750
Oh, there's my hammer.

1675
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:28,430
Coney, stop focusing on the hammer!

1676
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:31,490
I killed the duck, or would the duck kill me if I hammered him?

1677
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:34,690
Bidoof!

1678
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:36,770
Bidoof!

1679
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:40,290
That's so funny.

1680
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:48,150
I didn't think there was a way Coney could ruin it.

1681
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:51,450
Oh no, and then Matt...

1682
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:54,230
Matt probably will have to clown on them.

1683
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,770
You totally didn't fuck up, did you?

1684
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,410
The gnome did.

1685
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:04,510
We were talking about Tekken and everything.

1686
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:09,930
He led the gnomes to the treasure.

1687
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:10,970
He did!

1688
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:14,010
He led them to everything!

1689
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:15,290
No, I need more.

1690
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:16,410
Get another thing.

1691
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:20,810
It's okay, we got this.

1692
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:22,230
There's still three of us alive.

1693
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:27,130
I'm spectating you, Matt, and I saw it.

1694
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:28,730
I saw it all, Matt.

1695
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:31,250
I saw it all.

1696
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:35,650
Matt, if he fucking fell into the pit with that...

1697
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:38,770
He's playing with fire.

1698
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:39,910
Minus 2,900.

1699
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:42,210
If I die, my blood is on your hand!

1700
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:42,750
What?

1701
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:45,830
Brawl Pro, no!

1702
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,250
Brawl Pro, no!

1703
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:55,090
There's a frogman over there, too.

1704
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:57,450
Minus 3,600.

1705
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:58,630
Goodbye.

1706
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:01,150
Hello, Brawl Pro.

1707
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:03,370
Hey, how's it going?

1708
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:04,970
Those guys are boring anyways.

1709
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:06,070
I'm glad to be here.

1710
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:10,690
Okay, so what Coney did...

1711
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:14,170
He led the gnomes to all the treasure.

1712
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:16,230
And then the gnomes started hitting the treasure.

1713
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:17,210
Oh my god.

1714
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:19,490
And then Coney was like, What happened?

1715
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:22,610
Coney didn't know where his hammer was.

1716
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:25,610
The hammer was on the ground.

1717
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:27,550
And the hammer exploded.

1718
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:28,630
Push the cart forward!

1719
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,210
Push the cart forward, Matt!

1720
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:31,630
Push the cart forward!

1721
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,660
Bye-bye, cart.

1722
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,180
Oh my god.

1723
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,780
All right, Brawl Pro, I'll find your body.

1724
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,060
Matt!

1725
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:49,360
You told me for it!

1726
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:50,420
Oh my god!

1727
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:51,260
What happened?

1728
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:55,660
Your cart was not fully armed!

1729
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:57,360
Oh.

1730
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,200
Oh no.

1731
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,320
Wait, what happened?

1732
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,340
Oh my god!

1733
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:09,550
I got it, I got it.

1734
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:12,250
Also, Matt, I did see you.

1735
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,770
I did see you smash your object.

1736
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:14,790
No, you did not.

1737
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:15,310
You don't need to see that at all.

1738
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:17,910
Here, Coney, look, watch this.

1739
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:18,890
You can do this.

1740
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:20,330
I'll do it.

1741
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:21,770
You can do that, Coney.

1742
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:25,090
If you lead the gnomes...

1743
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:27,970
If you lead the gnomes...

1744
01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:28,790
Please!

1745
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,890
Oh my god, nice bonk.

1746
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,510
Got him!

1747
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:33,870
Holy fuck!

1748
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:47,830
Do it.

1749
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:49,890
Goodbye.

1750
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:52,590
This is not good.

1751
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,230
This is not good.

1752
01:36:58,290 --> 01:37:00,550
Where's the other extraction, though?

1753
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,040
This is not good.

1754
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,360
It's just the two of us.

1755
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:13,380
Just the two of us.

1756
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,320
Where the fuck is the third extraction?

1757
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,560
I thought that was a money bag.

1758
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:20,200
It's a frog.

1759
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,400
It's the alien and the frog.

1760
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:30,780
Where the fuck is the next extraction?

1761
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:41,070
I'm running.

1762
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:46,240
There?

1763
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:51,860
Yippee!

1764
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:55,340
Let's get 14k by ourselves!

1765
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:56,920
Yippee!

1766
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,600
Wait, we're missing one person.

1767
01:37:58,860 --> 01:37:59,820
Oh yeah, RawPro.

1768
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:02,440
I don't remember where he died.

1769
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,320
Wait, all of this is almost explored.

1770
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,700
I'm a little worried here.

1771
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:16,200
This might be where we caught GaloGG's, guys.

1772
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:17,520
It was a good run.

1773
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:21,140
It was a really good run, guys.

1774
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,880
Just the two of us.

1775
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,300
Okay, we gotta stick together.

1776
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,440
We're both 1 HP.

1777
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,840
We have to stick together.

1778
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,320
Wait, where are you?

1779
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:36,120
I'm upstairs.

1780
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,440
Wait, there's an upstairs?

1781
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:39,040
Yeah.

1782
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,660
How did you get upstairs?

1783
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:48,780
Guess we're not sticking together.

1784
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,570
There's a stairway over here.

1785
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:54,950
I have to push this cube off.

1786
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:56,030
I'm not strong enough.

1787
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:58,290
Wait, how do I go upstairs?

1788
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:00,610
Oh, it's here.

1789
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:05,950
There's another head.

1790
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:07,390
That's RawPro.

1791
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:08,490
I'll grab it later.

1792
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,740
Yeah, I'm upstairs.

1793
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:16,100
Wait, I'm at the wrong upstairs.

1794
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:18,800
Wait, I'm at a different upstairs.

1795
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:26,660
Where's the upstairs to that upstairs?

1796
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,540
Okay, we gotta stick together.

1797
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,980
I found RawPro's head.

1798
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,140
Okay, I found a cube.

1799
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:39,960
I'm trying to do what I can with my limited strength.

1800
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:43,420
I can't believe our Bidoof died.

1801
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,300
I know, right?

1802
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,160
What's the point?

1803
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,720
After all the veggies and roids we gave him.

1804
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,700
Wait, how do we do this?

1805
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:55,680
This is gonna be hard.

1806
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,360
How do we...

1807
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:01,680
Why is it so high up?

1808
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,360
Come on.

1809
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,400
We got this.

1810
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:05,860
Oh god.

1811
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:06,640
Oh god.

1812
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:11,580
We're not strong enough.

1813
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:15,900
Where is our Bidoof when we need him?

1814
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:17,840
Put it on the right side of the stairs.

1815
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,620
I'm gonna let go.

1816
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:21,080
Okay.

1817
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:23,140
No, I'm gonna push.

1818
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:24,560
I push, you pull.

1819
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:26,540
There we go.

1820
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:26,720
There we go.

1821
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:27,000
There we go.

1822
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,080
It's right there.

1823
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,260
Oh, I have an idea.

1824
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:33,500
We did it.

1825
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:33,800
Nice.

1826
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,720
Oh, that's a little awkward.

1827
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:37,540
We can just push it.

1828
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:39,980
Okay.

1829
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:43,440
Nice.

1830
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:45,000
We're almost there.

1831
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,520
How did you get upstairs last time?

1832
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:51,620
Over here.

1833
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:53,480
Okay, okay.

1834
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,500
Is there more stuff?

1835
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,980
I'm gonna check this little balcony area.

1836
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,680
Yeah, there typically is.

1837
01:40:59,160 --> 01:40:59,560
Alright.

1838
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:03,100
Now there's nothing left.

1839
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,580
Oh no, it's empty.

1840
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:08,780
Oh wait, no, there's one thing.

1841
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:10,520
There's a froggy.

1842
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:15,240
Oh, there's an expensive thing over here.

1843
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,520
Yeah.

1844
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,420
It's just $50, guys.

1845
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:21,580
I only lost $50, it's fine.

1846
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,660
1 HP and a dream.

1847
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:29,780
Oh!

1848
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:32,680
5k more.

1849
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,800
Do you need help with the last thing?

1850
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,920
Uh, there's two more things.

1851
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:40,540
One is like 20k.

1852
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,080
Oh god.

1853
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,940
Okay, one is 20k.

1854
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:46,660
Okay.

1855
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,660
I'm heading up.

1856
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:51,000
Let me try and grab it.

1857
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:52,380
Where is it?

1858
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,280
What's 20k?

1859
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,940
Is it the broom?

1860
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,060
Uh, there's a...

1861
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,420
A wizard frog staff.

1862
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:04,240
What is the broom?

1863
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,120
There's a secret room over here.

1864
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,580
Wait, there's a secret?

1865
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,900
Oh my god.

1866
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:12,520
Oh fuck.

1867
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,960
Oh my god, a secret.

1868
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:20,440
Oh my god.

1869
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,240
Can't do it.

1870
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:26,260
Wait, I got this.

1871
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,960
Wait, I can help.

1872
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:29,120
Oh!

1873
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,650
I see.

1874
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:38,910
There's a frog.

1875
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:47,040
Okay, you got it?

1876
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:47,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1877
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:53,500
If that hits a wall, it might shoot a laser beam.

1878
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:57,600
Okay, you jumped down.

1879
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,560
Okay, and then you hold it.

1880
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:01,700
Okay.

1881
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,100
I don't trust myself.

1882
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,380
Okay, if you hit that, that's gonna shoot yourself.

1883
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,580
You're gonna shoot yourself.

1884
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:11,140
Yeah.

1885
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:13,040
I'm gonna let go.

1886
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:19,070
Okay, cool.

1887
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:20,390
I'll grab the other head.

1888
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,510
Okay, I'm grabbing the other head.

1889
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:30,930
Wait, that's not where he died.

1890
01:43:30,930 --> 01:43:34,050
Oh, he died all the way there?

1891
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:45,990
Okay.

1892
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:48,910
You got it.

1893
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:18,680
No!

1894
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:46,330
Are you fucking kidding me?

1895
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:52,510
Oh, okay.

1896
01:44:57,150 --> 01:44:58,630
Wait, did he die?

1897
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:06,050
Did he die?

1898
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,940
No, there's two.

1899
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:13,980
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

1900
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:27,770
I see three.

1901
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:28,690
It's fine.

1902
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:30,610
Are you serious?

1903
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:33,510
Are

1904
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:39,950
you fucking serious?

1905
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:40,330
Are you serious?

1906
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:06,470
Oh,

1907
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:52,130
god!

1908
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:54,520
Oh, jesus.

1909
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:55,360
Oh, jesus.

1910
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,600
Oh, jesus, Rick.

1911
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,160
Please, please, please.

1912
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:04,540
Oh, my god, please come back!

1913
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:06,100
I can't do this alone!

1914
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,480
Oh!

1915
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:20,480
We're alive!

1916
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,020
Holy moly.

1917
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,080
I have one HP!

1918
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:31,820
One whole HP!

1919
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,100
There are two clowns.

1920
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:41,620
Okay, when you see a clown and he lasers, just duck.

1921
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,480
Duck the lasers.

1922
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,120
Okay, got it.

1923
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:47,240
Got it, coach.

1924
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,440
Don't mind if I do.

1925
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,500
Man, I wish we had a cart.

1926
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:58,380
I wonder what happened to that cart.

1927
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,160
Oh, there's a giant thing here.

1928
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,140
Yeah.

1929
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:06,560
Ironically, literally every doll... be careful.

1930
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:09,380
Oh, my god.

1931
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:10,840
Yeah, we actually can't...

1932
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,820
Man, I wish we still had that staff.

1933
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,240
Yeah.

1934
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:17,900
Oh!

1935
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:20,500
What?

1936
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,020
No.

1937
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:32,100
I can help you.

1938
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,740
I'm helping you right now.

1939
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,360
Are we going any faster right now?

1940
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:39,480
Are we going any faster?

1941
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:46,040
Whoa, we're going so fast!

1942
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:51,560
Why is my whole team is chopped and screwed?

1943
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,960
Okay, put it down carefully.

1944
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,160
Put it down carefully.

1945
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:58,400
Guys, we actually did it.

1946
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:59,480
Oh, my god, we did.

1947
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:00,500
Okay, one HP.

1948
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,100
We gotta get back home.

1949
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,700
I'm leaving now.

1950
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:03,100
Bye-bye.

1951
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:03,460
Goodbye.

1952
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:08,980
Every man for himself.

1953
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:12,740
Only one person has to make it back.

1954
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:13,640
Scatter!

1955
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:13,860
Scatter!

1956
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,940
I said scatter.

1957
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:01,430
Oh, my god.

1958
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:04,290
I didn't know who it was.

1959
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:04,670
Shh!

1960
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:07,670
Some of them are triggered by something.

1961
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:09,570
Don't be so scared!

1962
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:12,210
We made it.

1963
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:12,450
Woo!

1964
01:51:15,690 --> 01:51:16,870
Oh, thank you.

1965
01:51:17,010 --> 01:51:18,330
Go team!

1966
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:19,290
We did it!

1967
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:22,350
Go team!

1968
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:25,410
Oh, nice.

1969
01:51:25,610 --> 01:51:26,090
Oh, nice.

1970
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:28,910
Oh, my god, we all made it.

1971
01:51:29,130 --> 01:51:30,210
Everybody made it!

1972
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:31,710
We all made it.

1973
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:33,790
Oh, my god.

1974
01:51:34,190 --> 01:51:36,510
We have a run, guys.

1975
01:51:36,870 --> 01:51:38,030
Oh, my god.

1976
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:39,830
This is a big run.

1977
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:44,070
Oh, my god, dude.

1978
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:46,990
Dude, put a bunch of gamers in a single repo lobby.

1979
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:47,690
See what happens.

1980
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:51,190
Holy shit.

1981
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:51,830
Okay, guys.

1982
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:54,310
We are not buying any hammers.

1983
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:57,970
We're buying HP, guys.

1984
01:51:58,010 --> 01:51:58,410
It's fine.

1985
01:51:58,810 --> 01:51:59,550
It's fine.

1986
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:03,510
We need help.

1987
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:04,270
Fine.

1988
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:06,230
A sword!

1989
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:08,990
Let's just drink.

1990
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:10,790
We might have to kill them.

1991
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:14,070
I was gonna say, what if we had to kill the bad guys?

1992
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:17,330
There were two clowns last time.

1993
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:18,670
There's a health upgrade here.

1994
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:21,390
Technically, we should be like...

1995
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:25,230
Do we have enough for like any upgrades?

1996
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:27,390
Range, stamina...

1997
01:52:28,110 --> 01:52:29,550
I gotta go potty.

1998
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:31,770
Okay, I can get stamina.

1999
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:35,710
Okay.

2000
01:52:37,890 --> 01:52:38,730
Flush him.

2001
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:40,870
I got a hat.

2002
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:43,330
I better not get flushed.

2003
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:45,450
You're getting washed.

2004
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:46,810
Oh, thank you.

2005
01:52:46,890 --> 01:52:47,950
This is great.

2006
01:52:49,390 --> 01:52:50,710
I'm like an infant.

2007
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:51,790
Holy shit.

2008
01:52:52,710 --> 01:52:53,850
I'm an infant.

2009
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:58,450
I guess she saw the last Street Fighter Slim.

2010
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:00,990
Oh, god.

2011
01:53:01,110 --> 01:53:02,090
Don't bring that up.

2012
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:03,690
I went like 210.

2013
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:05,470
Don't bring it up, Kody.

2014
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:11,010
Okay, Kody, Kody, but you won Twitch Rivals, so that's all you want Twitch Rivals.

2015
01:53:11,650 --> 01:53:13,170
Kody, remember that.

2016
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:14,490
I know.

2017
01:53:14,650 --> 01:53:16,810
I was talking about we would 0-7.

2018
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:20,250
Dude.

2019
01:53:21,450 --> 01:53:21,770
It's okay.

2020
01:53:22,450 --> 01:53:23,470
It's a creed.

2021
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:24,490
I'm not Twitch Rivals.

2022
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:26,410
Press Q.

2023
01:53:27,790 --> 01:53:29,850
Oh, never mind.

2024
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:31,730
I'm okay.

2025
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:36,670
I'll go in the car.

2026
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:40,770
I want to go in the car, too.

2027
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:41,470
Me, too.

2028
01:53:42,150 --> 01:53:42,610
Let's go.

2029
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:43,250
Free samples.

2030
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:44,870
I want a snack.

2031
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:46,670
I want free samples.

2032
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:49,830
I want Lucky Charms.

2033
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:50,990
I want Lucky Charms.

2034
01:53:51,810 --> 01:53:54,010
They don't have Lucky Charms here.

2035
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:55,470
I want Lucky Charms.

2036
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:58,530
Ehhh Oh

2037
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:21,450
I think I deserve HP after the fucking clutch I did.

2038
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:27,070
Wait, what happened to it?

2039
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:29,510
You know what happened to it.

2040
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:31,150
You know what happened to it.

2041
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:33,830
My hammer's back.

2042
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:37,690
I don't think you should be allowed to use the hammer, Kody.

2043
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:40,430
Oh, he's covetous of my hammer.

2044
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:40,870
Okay.

2045
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:42,830
That's not what I'm saying.

2046
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:45,710
No, I think my chat's right.

2047
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:47,910
We definitely start buying weapons now.

2048
01:54:49,110 --> 01:54:50,970
We gotta kill things.

2049
01:54:51,290 --> 01:54:53,450
Level 7 is pretty far in, right?

2050
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:56,790
Level 7 is the best I've ever done.

2051
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:58,630
Which is like right now.

2052
01:54:58,770 --> 01:55:01,270
This is the best you've ever done, Matt.

2053
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:03,070
Holy shit.

2054
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:03,990
You're right.

2055
01:55:09,090 --> 01:55:10,450
There's nothing like...

2056
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:12,030
up top.

2057
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:15,070
Where's our cart?

2058
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:17,530
Oh, a clown!

2059
01:55:18,730 --> 01:55:19,250
Already?

2060
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:21,070
Oh, no.

2061
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:21,590
A good clown.

2062
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:22,870
Oh, I thought you meant...

2063
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:23,870
There's something here.

2064
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:26,670
The map says there's...

2065
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:26,970
Oh, wait.

2066
01:55:27,070 --> 01:55:27,270
No.

2067
01:55:27,410 --> 01:55:28,450
It was on the other side.

2068
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:31,390
It's moving.

2069
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:33,770
That's just what Kody, I think, picked up.

2070
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,870
Oh, there's...

2071
01:55:37,350 --> 01:55:38,270
Oh, you can go up here?

2072
01:55:39,230 --> 01:55:40,470
What's this level design?

2073
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:42,050
There's nothing here, though.

2074
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:45,050
Oh, God.

2075
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:46,130
There's an outside.

2076
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:48,710
There's a bomb.

2077
01:55:50,070 --> 01:55:51,110
There's nothing here.

2078
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:52,050
Oh, there is.

2079
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:53,950
There's a face.

2080
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:56,270
Tiny little face.

2081
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:58,490
How much is that worth?

2082
01:55:58,610 --> 01:55:59,310
$2,000.

2083
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:01,370
$2,000?

2084
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:03,230
That's a lot for what that is.

2085
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:04,610
Wait, check the locker.

2086
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:05,450
Check the locker.

2087
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:09,450
I got something.

2088
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:10,630
I got $1,000.

2089
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:14,270
Did we ever get our cart back?

2090
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:17,850
I'm not sure.

2091
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:18,930
Hey, guys.

2092
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:20,870
Did we ever get our cart back or no?

2093
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:22,290
We should have it back.

2094
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,730
Yeah, yeah.

2095
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:23,190
We got it back.

2096
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:23,590
Oh, okay.

2097
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:23,910
Nice.

2098
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:27,570
Alright, we got one here.

2099
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:29,590
How much do we have right now?

2100
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:30,750
Okay, nine.

2101
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:37,870
Oh, this is where we start.

2102
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:40,030
Head, head, head, head, head through that door.

2103
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:41,290
Head through that door on the right.

2104
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:43,230
Dude, I hate that thing.

2105
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:45,170
Someone has to lead him.

2106
01:56:46,150 --> 01:56:51,870
We have to lead him somewhere else because if he goes to our items, we're fucked.

2107
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:52,810
A chalice.

2108
01:56:54,370 --> 01:56:55,410
The holy grail.

2109
01:56:55,450 --> 01:56:57,350
Wait, how do they go to that side?

2110
01:56:58,970 --> 01:57:01,750
Oh, is it this way?

2111
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:03,250
Where?

2112
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:07,310
Parkour.

2113
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:11,990
What do I do with parkour?

2114
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:14,470
You crouch, you crouch.

2115
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:16,210
When you crouch, your flat plate turns off.

2116
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:20,590
Is there anything up here?

2117
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:22,470
Oh, shit.

2118
01:57:23,410 --> 01:57:24,070
No, no, no.

2119
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:25,530
Just keep pressing it.

2120
01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:30,300
I'm not.

2121
01:57:37,690 --> 01:57:38,610
I'm losing HP.

2122
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:39,410
I can't tell.

2123
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:42,710
I don't even remember how much HP I lost.

2124
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:44,530
How much HP I had.

2125
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:00,000
Yeah, he doesn't like that.

2126
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:01,280
Oh!

2127
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:05,080
Is there anything downstairs?

2128
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:06,920
Oh, I want the guitar.

2129
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:11,840
I thought there was no fog that much.

2130
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,340
I think I lied to you.

2131
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:16,780
I can't believe people just lie on the internet like that.

2132
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,620
I am a strong...

2133
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:27,440
I'm a big boy.

2134
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:31,020
I'm a... Mommy says I'm a big boy.

2135
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:33,960
Look at that.

2136
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:34,880
Big boy.

2137
01:58:40,230 --> 01:58:43,390
Look at that big boy doing big boy things.

2138
01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:49,610
No!

2139
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:51,030
No!

2140
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:54,230
No!

2141
01:58:56,150 --> 01:58:56,950
Please!

2142
01:58:57,730 --> 01:58:58,530
Please!

2143
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:05,800
Sounds like a void problem.

2144
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:10,000
What the fuck is that?

2145
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,400
What happened?

2146
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:13,080
What the fuck?

2147
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,300
There's an eyeball on the ceiling.

2148
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:17,880
Oh yeah, I just break L.O.S.

2149
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:20,460
But it's hard to do.

2150
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:21,740
Eyeball?

2151
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:22,140
Where?

2152
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,860
The guitar fucking blocked me from the beginning.

2153
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:30,440
The guitar was so big.

2154
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:32,710
The guitar was so big.

2155
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:34,260
I couldn't...

2156
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:36,160
I didn't see him.

2157
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,560
There's nothing here.

2158
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,080
Are you okay?

2159
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:47,440
Where did it go?

2160
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,240
I'm so sad.

2161
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:51,280
Are you okay?

2162
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:53,180
I'm so sad.

2163
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:58,820
The guitar blocked me from playing in real life.

2164
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:00,300
What the fuck was that?

2165
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,280
Somebody has to believe me.

2166
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:02,860
Guys!

2167
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:05,000
I believe you, Cody.

2168
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:08,480
I believe you.

2169
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:09,440
I believe you, dude.

2170
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,420
Wait, who broke this door?

2171
02:00:14,380 --> 02:00:17,000
I believe you, Cody.

2172
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,380
I believe you.

2173
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:23,380
Is there anything up there?

2174
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:24,300
No.

2175
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:28,820
I saw the guitar.

2176
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:32,520
I saw something fall down the stairs on the map.

2177
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:36,320
It was like...

2178
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,700
It was me.

2179
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:41,020
It was me.

2180
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:44,060
I'm something.

2181
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:49,000
I can't believe it.

2182
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:51,640
I can't believe it.

2183
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:57,080
I was showing everyone how much of a big boy I was.

2184
02:00:57,580 --> 02:01:12,640
And then the guitar blocked my field of vision so I didn't see the giant head until it started screaming at me.

2185
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:23,160
The guitar was the big boy all along.

2186
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:26,900
The guitar was the big boy.

2187
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,540
Sad.

2188
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:33,260
I'm gonna grab water.

2189
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:34,440
I'll be right back, guys.

2190
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:40,940
He was trying to scare me, but I was like...

2191
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:43,840
Dude, I was like, wait, is that a monster?

2192
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:48,040
The thing looked like a red tentacle.

2193
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:51,480
The flashlight, so I thought there really was something.

2194
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:53,000
Wait, this thing is worth 21k.

2195
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,440
Money here, too.

2196
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,060
Hello?

2197
02:01:59,400 --> 02:01:59,500
Money?

2198
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:00,840
I'll just put it in the cart.

2199
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:02,960
Everybody left.

2200
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:10,920
Everybody left me.

2201
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:13,740
Yet again.

2202
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:18,540
If you get a certain amount, does it roll over or no?

2203
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:19,380
No, right?

2204
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:23,760
It does?

2205
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:29,480
Is that Doki's head?

2206
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:32,500
Doki, what happened to you?

2207
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:37,980
Alright, let me get this big ass server.

2208
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:40,880
I think I'm too strong.

2209
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:42,660
Where's the cart?

2210
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:44,440
Oh, I see it.

2211
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:49,280
Hold on, I'm taking this.

2212
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:56,060
A guitar?

2213
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:57,880
Oh my god, what's ahead?

2214
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:00,380
What's happening?

2215
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:02,980
Oh my god.

2216
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:17,000
I'm still the only one dead!

2217
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:19,280
It's not fair!

2218
02:03:29,730 --> 02:03:33,030
Cody was the right POV to watch.

2219
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:35,330
Oh my god!

2220
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:38,790
Cody, you stupid fucking abber!

2221
02:03:39,290 --> 02:03:42,430
Cody, you stupid fucking abber!

2222
02:03:59,130 --> 02:03:59,890
Motherfucker!

2223
02:04:03,010 --> 02:04:05,170
There's a baby that chucked some money at me.

2224
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:07,550
Wait, how is that a bad thing?

2225
02:04:08,750 --> 02:04:11,090
I mean, streamers...

2226
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:16,530
Oh, Cody...

2227
02:04:16,530 --> 02:04:20,550
What's the point of giving him so much strength if he can't even carry it?

2228
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:24,130
What the fuck was the point?

2229
02:04:28,410 --> 02:04:31,050
I got like double...

2230
02:04:31,050 --> 02:04:40,870
I had a guitar on me and I didn't realize there was a head in front of me because the guitar was bigger than my field of vision.

2231
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:42,610
Yeah, I was struggling with that too.

2232
02:04:43,550 --> 02:04:45,710
Yeah, and then I was like, yippee!

2233
02:04:46,090 --> 02:04:51,670
The head guy screamed at me and then I saw him when he was this close to my face.

2234
02:04:51,970 --> 02:04:56,230
And then I ran downstairs and then I got eyed.

2235
02:04:56,770 --> 02:04:58,130
The Soran Eye got me.

2236
02:04:58,130 --> 02:04:59,550
And then they just...

2237
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:01,590
literally comboed.

2238
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:02,830
I just got comboed.

2239
02:05:03,010 --> 02:05:04,170
There was no hope.

2240
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:07,930
I can't believe Cody is the one that survives out of all of this.

2241
02:05:14,110 --> 02:05:16,210
Yeah, we literally BDoofed him.

2242
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:17,790
We literally...

2243
02:05:17,790 --> 02:05:18,690
Did he just die?

2244
02:05:18,790 --> 02:05:19,630
I'm done, brother.

2245
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:20,450
I am done.

2246
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:21,990
Is that not water?

2247
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:24,330
What is that?

2248
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:27,130
What is my team doing?

2249
02:05:27,470 --> 02:05:28,810
No way.

2250
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:30,890
The pool killed everyone.

2251
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:33,350
We all died to the pool.

2252
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:44,740
Why did nobody tell me there was water behind me?

2253
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:46,280
Oh, I'm sorry!

2254
02:05:46,420 --> 02:05:47,220
I died!

2255
02:05:48,300 --> 02:05:48,980
I...

2256
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:52,840
Cody, by the way, I saw the eye, Cody.

2257
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:54,120
I saw it.

2258
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:56,720
I'm outvalidated.

2259
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:59,480
I'm outvalidated.

2260
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,080
I was the only one that saw it, because I was dead.

2261
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,880
Because that's what killed me, too.

2262
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,940
My diamond also lost value.

2263
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:10,520
Where's my head?

2264
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:13,100
Because I had 4k on that server.

2265
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:15,740
There's no way he can get the server.

2266
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,400
Hold on.

2267
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,700
Wait, can he not move the cart?

2268
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,420
No, he can, but he's trying to Tetris this.

2269
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:24,980
He's trying to Tetris it.

2270
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:25,920
Oh, I see.

2271
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:29,060
Yeah, he's trying to Tetris everything.

2272
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:34,060
He takes something out of the cart, hoping it's a treasure, and it's just dead heads every time.

2273
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:44,360
I mean, we have a good amount.

2274
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:45,780
He just needs to make a couple trips.

2275
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:48,160
Why is he taking it one by one?

2276
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:49,480
I think that's enough Tetris.

2277
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:50,820
Now he's like...

2278
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,320
Yeah, now he's Tetris-ing a little.

2279
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,540
They're all so small, too.

2280
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:56,760
Maybe he's trying to take cart with him, you know?

2281
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:58,740
Or maybe he's just AFK.

2282
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:01,520
How much HP does he have?

2283
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:02,900
A lot.

2284
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:03,540
He has 100.

2285
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:07,040
If he leaves the cart behind, I have no justification for what he just did.

2286
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:08,280
Why did he do that?

2287
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,540
Why did he do that?

2288
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,400
Oh, I think the server blew up.

2289
02:07:13,180 --> 02:07:14,060
That's what it was.

2290
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:16,640
Wait, why did he not even take...

2291
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:17,860
Why did he do all that?

2292
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:18,640
I don't understand.

2293
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:20,600
I don't understand.

2294
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:24,640
Why is he not bringing the cart with him?

2295
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:27,040
Oh, and he breaks the doors.

2296
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:32,060
Knocked out the gamer.

2297
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:33,060
Oh, what's that?

2298
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:33,900
Oh, what's that?

2299
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:34,240
Something?

2300
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:35,780
That's a chainsaw.

2301
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:36,540
What, she missed?

2302
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:37,940
Oh my god, that's actually a thing.

2303
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,780
There's no way.

2304
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,900
You see the yellow dot.

2305
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:43,500
There it is!

2306
02:07:44,180 --> 02:07:46,360
Oh, he has enough strength.

2307
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:49,960
Wait, can you kill Can you kill enemies with that?

2308
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:51,440
I think you can, yeah.

2309
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:55,960
But he can't touch anything or the blades get dulled.

2310
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:57,780
If something hears me because of this, you got it.

2311
02:07:58,540 --> 02:07:59,100
What did he say?

2312
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:01,780
Oh yeah, they can hear him, probably.

2313
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:04,760
It's fine, he'll chop the head.

2314
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:05,540
Yeah, yeah.

2315
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,420
Surely this is worth 5k.

2316
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:09,140
Oh, but then it can also hit the items.

2317
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:10,520
It can also hit the items, too.

2318
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:13,600
Oh, he needs one...

2319
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:16,580
Oh, he needs to move it a little closer because it can get destroyed.

2320
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:19,240
It's like literally against the wall.

2321
02:08:22,050 --> 02:08:23,250
He can make it.

2322
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:27,350
That thing up top, that's a laptop.

2323
02:08:27,570 --> 02:08:28,710
That's possible when he sees it.

2324
02:08:30,050 --> 02:08:31,570
I believe in him.

2325
02:08:31,610 --> 02:08:31,950
PogChamp.

2326
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:35,210
Oh my god!

2327
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:40,430
How did that even happen?

2328
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:43,390
Oh, it's over.

2329
02:08:43,550 --> 02:08:45,110
He's trying to fight it, he should just leave.

2330
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:47,770
No, he only lost 10 HP.

2331
02:08:47,770 --> 02:08:50,190
Oh, he's full HP, I thought he was one.

2332
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:51,390
No, no, no.

2333
02:08:51,470 --> 02:08:52,730
He lost nothing.

2334
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:57,510
He got the 100 HP thingy and he didn't share.

2335
02:08:57,610 --> 02:08:58,950
How much does a laptop cost?

2336
02:08:59,630 --> 02:09:03,630
It said he lost a thousand there, so...

2337
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:05,130
I mean, I don't know about you guys, but...

2338
02:09:05,130 --> 02:09:06,450
We're back, we're back!

2339
02:09:07,290 --> 02:09:10,070
Void's gonna share his HP with all of us, right?

2340
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:12,150
Surely, surely, surely.

2341
02:09:12,450 --> 02:09:12,730
Right?

2342
02:09:12,730 --> 02:09:15,170
I certainly won't be one HP the entire game.

2343
02:09:15,170 --> 02:09:16,670
Everybody say heal me when we come back.

2344
02:09:17,090 --> 02:09:18,150
Okay, okay, here we go, here we go.

2345
02:09:19,950 --> 02:09:22,970
Heal me, heal me, heal me!

2346
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:23,770
Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me!

2347
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:24,470
Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me!

2348
02:09:24,530 --> 02:09:25,470
What are you doing?

2349
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:28,730
You would rather die?

2350
02:09:39,530 --> 02:09:40,490
He's like...

2351
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:42,630
He doesn't wanna work anymore, that was nuts.

2352
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:44,350
I've never had more than one HP.

2353
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:46,510
That was his final retirement.

2354
02:09:46,790 --> 02:09:48,850
He could've gave you some and then died.

2355
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:51,090
He could have given us...

2356
02:09:51,090 --> 02:09:53,610
He could have healed us and then he's dead.

2357
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:56,730
He could have healed us first.

2358
02:09:57,210 --> 02:09:58,370
He just went in.

2359
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:00,030
Why are we putting his head in the cart?

2360
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:03,250
That's true, you're right, you're so right.

2361
02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:04,550
He threw that shit.

2362
02:10:05,010 --> 02:10:06,830
He threw that shit at us, bro.

2363
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:08,470
He threw that for us.

2364
02:10:08,790 --> 02:10:09,890
That's crazy.

2365
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:13,770
Alright, I found a clown.

2366
02:10:14,210 --> 02:10:14,590
Hong Kong.

2367
02:10:16,050 --> 02:10:17,070
Here we go.

2368
02:10:17,350 --> 02:10:17,910
Wait, Kony.

2369
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:18,950
What?

2370
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:19,310
Yeah?

2371
02:10:20,030 --> 02:10:21,910
I need your strength up here.

2372
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:23,530
Say no more.

2373
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:26,670
Oh shit, wait.

2374
02:10:26,990 --> 02:10:27,830
Hey, that's it.

2375
02:10:28,670 --> 02:10:29,310
What is it?

2376
02:10:30,090 --> 02:10:30,730
Yeah.

2377
02:10:31,570 --> 02:10:32,890
It's Bill's PC.

2378
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:37,950
Wait, who broke this fucking door?

2379
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:46,150
Okay.

2380
02:10:47,430 --> 02:10:49,370
Okay, we might need him actually.

2381
02:10:49,370 --> 02:10:51,570
Yeah, bring his head.

2382
02:10:56,280 --> 02:10:57,480
Oh, minus 2k.

2383
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:01,920
Okay,

2384
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,620
you guys just slowly bring it over.

2385
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:08,780
Okay, I'll help you.

2386
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,480
I don't want to fall in the water again.

2387
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:11,500
There's no water.

2388
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,160
There's no water.

2389
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:13,040
There's no water.

2390
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:17,360
We looked.

2391
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,460
You're good, keep going.

2392
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:21,540
Right side, right, right, right.

2393
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:22,900
Oh, I see it.

2394
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:25,000
Make a right turn.

2395
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:29,180
Okay, we gotta make sure we place it in a way where it doesn't get crushed.

2396
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:29,640
Okay?

2397
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:32,920
There.

2398
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:34,620
Guys, guys, guys.

2399
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:37,300
Guys, guys.

2400
02:11:37,540 --> 02:11:38,620
That is not clean.

2401
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,040
Okay, we need 1k.

2402
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:42,240
Just grab 1k.

2403
02:11:43,380 --> 02:11:44,460
Yeah, no, I grabbed his head.

2404
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:47,900
Grab 2 items.

2405
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:48,740
Don't put the cart in.

2406
02:11:48,820 --> 02:11:49,940
We don't have room for the cart.

2407
02:11:50,740 --> 02:11:51,420
Oh, really?

2408
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:52,580
Yeah, we don't.

2409
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:53,660
Just grab items from it.

2410
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:54,900
This clown will be enough.

2411
02:11:57,540 --> 02:11:57,940
Yeah.

2412
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:00,020
He's gonna be part of this.

2413
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:01,500
There you go.

2414
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:02,340
Clown goes on.

2415
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:03,080
And then we get it.

2416
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:05,680
We have enough.

2417
02:12:06,620 --> 02:12:07,660
Just bring the cart back up.

2418
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:09,040
I wanna do it.

2419
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:10,320
We have enough.

2420
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:13,260
It's in.

2421
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:15,520
I got it.

2422
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:17,780
Alright, Void's back.

2423
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:19,440
Void is coming back.

2424
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:21,720
He has to be part of this game.

2425
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:21,900
Heal me.

2426
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:22,440
Heal me.

2427
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:23,020
Heal me.

2428
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:24,020
Heal me.

2429
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:24,640
Heal me.

2430
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:25,480
Heal me.

2431
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:26,420
Heal me.

2432
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:28,600
It's okay, guys.

2433
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:29,740
The health was a crutch.

2434
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:31,360
Right, right, right.

2435
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:33,280
Yeah, you're so right.

2436
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:36,020
We might as well not buy health packs after this.

2437
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:36,500
Right, guys?

2438
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:39,500
Yeah, we don't need health packs.

2439
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:40,980
Oh, head.

2440
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:41,380
Head.

2441
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:41,700
Head.

2442
02:12:41,860 --> 02:12:42,180
Head.

2443
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:42,620
Head.

2444
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:42,900
Head.

2445
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:43,900
Head.

2446
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:44,220
Head.

2447
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:44,220
Head.

2448
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:55,070
He went left to right.

2449
02:12:56,550 --> 02:12:57,450
He's on the right.

2450
02:12:58,130 --> 02:12:58,630
He's still right.

2451
02:12:58,690 --> 02:12:59,150
He's still there.

2452
02:13:00,070 --> 02:13:00,690
He's in this room.

2453
02:13:00,830 --> 02:13:02,650
Yeah, he's big chillin'.

2454
02:13:03,670 --> 02:13:05,830
We gotta watch out for the thing on the ground.

2455
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:09,770
I'm gonna go in this room and see if it's extraction.

2456
02:13:09,910 --> 02:13:10,210
Hold on.

2457
02:13:10,890 --> 02:13:12,330
Okay, it should be at the end.

2458
02:13:21,990 --> 02:13:22,790
It's so wittable.

2459
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:24,230
Oh my god, we're doing it.

2460
02:13:24,330 --> 02:13:25,150
We're so...

2461
02:13:25,150 --> 02:13:27,430
Look, this ice cube is worth literally all we need.

2462
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:30,390
We need coding.

2463
02:13:30,610 --> 02:13:31,310
We actually...

2464
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:37,050
Is two people enough?

2465
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:39,130
Okay, but like...

2466
02:13:39,130 --> 02:13:40,970
You gotta make sure I don't fucking fall.

2467
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:43,990
Just look down and look at the wood.

2468
02:13:44,110 --> 02:13:44,650
You want me to...

2469
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:45,930
Okay, okay.

2470
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:46,570
You go.

2471
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:47,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2472
02:13:47,530 --> 02:13:48,250
Yeah, I believe.

2473
02:13:49,330 --> 02:13:49,730
Okay.

2474
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:50,810
Yeah, I can do it.

2475
02:13:52,610 --> 02:13:53,230
Here we go.

2476
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:58,310
Are you doing it?

2477
02:13:58,490 --> 02:13:59,090
Yeah, I'm good.

2478
02:13:59,470 --> 02:14:00,150
I swear I'm good.

2479
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:02,270
Wait, I'm not doing it either, though.

2480
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:05,150
I'm not looking down, guys.

2481
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:06,770
Just hold straight.

2482
02:14:07,030 --> 02:14:08,150
I gotta lift it a little bit.

2483
02:14:08,150 --> 02:14:09,850
It was the thing that was looping me.

2484
02:14:11,150 --> 02:14:12,950
I need like a third person in the lockers.

2485
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:14,970
It's like stuck on the wood.

2486
02:14:16,570 --> 02:14:18,030
There's never anything in the lockers.

2487
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:19,130
Yeah.

2488
02:14:19,450 --> 02:14:20,810
Usually when there is, like...

2489
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:25,150
Can I get a third person?

2490
02:14:25,270 --> 02:14:26,050
Can I get a third person?

2491
02:14:26,050 --> 02:14:27,610
We need a third person here.

2492
02:14:28,330 --> 02:14:31,210
I need help lifting this, but it's gonna be kinda...

2493
02:14:31,610 --> 02:14:31,970
Okay.

2494
02:14:32,850 --> 02:14:34,250
No, he's alive somewhere.

2495
02:14:34,510 --> 02:14:35,670
Then we don't have a strength meister.

2496
02:14:36,350 --> 02:14:37,770
Wait, did he actually die?

2497
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:39,570
Yeah, I saw him.

2498
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:42,170
What killed him?

2499
02:14:42,710 --> 02:14:43,970
How many do you have on this side?

2500
02:14:44,030 --> 02:14:44,470
That's the problem.

2501
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:45,430
Okay, okay.

2502
02:14:46,270 --> 02:14:47,970
Okay, I don't trust myself.

2503
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:48,970
Someone else do it.

2504
02:14:49,850 --> 02:14:50,150
Okay.

2505
02:14:50,350 --> 02:14:51,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2506
02:14:51,110 --> 02:14:51,330
That's all.

2507
02:14:51,430 --> 02:14:51,890
I'm good.

2508
02:14:52,790 --> 02:14:53,150
Okay.

2509
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:57,510
There you go.

2510
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:58,090
There you go.

2511
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:01,210
Should I take this cart down there?

2512
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:02,430
Once they're done.

2513
02:15:02,870 --> 02:15:05,550
If you accidentally ram somebody, you might...

2514
02:15:06,310 --> 02:15:07,090
You might die.

2515
02:15:08,770 --> 02:15:09,290
Okay.

2516
02:15:09,550 --> 02:15:10,610
That's Kony, right?

2517
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:11,750
Inside the ice cube, right?

2518
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:14,410
Yeah, he's stuck in here.

2519
02:15:14,590 --> 02:15:16,290
That's Kony right there.

2520
02:15:17,290 --> 02:15:18,970
I thought he was gonna get squished.

2521
02:15:19,470 --> 02:15:20,630
What the heck?

2522
02:15:20,650 --> 02:15:21,370
I don't know, hold on.

2523
02:15:22,570 --> 02:15:23,670
Diagonal mode is probably better.

2524
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:24,630
Oh, we need to fit the cart.

2525
02:15:24,730 --> 02:15:25,750
We still need to fit the cart.

2526
02:15:26,570 --> 02:15:27,130
Oh, shit.

2527
02:15:27,270 --> 02:15:30,170
Yeah, if we push it like this then, no?

2528
02:15:30,430 --> 02:15:31,450
What about make it vertical?

2529
02:15:32,070 --> 02:15:33,110
There you go, like this.

2530
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:33,910
This is good, this is good.

2531
02:15:35,090 --> 02:15:36,450
Wait, do you have Kony's head?

2532
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:38,010
Wait, we don't have Kony's head, guys!

2533
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:40,130
Wait, wait, wait, we don't have Kony yet.

2534
02:15:40,330 --> 02:15:41,230
Yeah, yeah, put it back.

2535
02:15:41,310 --> 02:15:42,070
Take it out, take it out.

2536
02:15:42,110 --> 02:15:43,130
We don't have Kony's head.

2537
02:15:43,730 --> 02:15:44,510
Where is his head?

2538
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:47,710
I don't know, I'll go on a journey, bye.

2539
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:49,270
Yeah, we'll just wait.

2540
02:15:50,050 --> 02:15:51,630
It's red on the map, no?

2541
02:15:52,610 --> 02:15:53,710
Somebody's seen it, it's red.

2542
02:15:54,470 --> 02:15:55,050
Oh, shit.

2543
02:15:55,210 --> 02:15:56,730
Oh, that means none of us have seen his head.

2544
02:15:59,030 --> 02:15:59,390
Kony!

2545
02:16:00,930 --> 02:16:01,290
Kony!

2546
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:13,820
Are they dead?

2547
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:15,140
Are you guys alive?

2548
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:16,100
Yes, they are, they are, they are.

2549
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:18,240
What's over there?

2550
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:27,900
Yeah, just try to find height.

2551
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:32,320
Oh, we didn't find Kony.

2552
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:34,680
Okay, well, I guess we're just going to deal with...

2553
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:36,540
I guess Kony's not coming back, then.

2554
02:16:37,560 --> 02:16:38,060
Yeah.

2555
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:41,200
He's somewhere, I could try.

2556
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:43,720
No, let's just...

2557
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:46,120
No, it's every man for themselves again.

2558
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:48,240
It's not.

2559
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:50,940
We could use our 8 gems, please.

2560
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:52,320
There's a baby.

2561
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:55,160
Is he worth anything?

2562
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:57,780
Well, I actually think that's Kony reincarnated.

2563
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:58,380
No?

2564
02:16:58,720 --> 02:16:59,180
Wait, really?

2565
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:01,060
I don't think that's possible.

2566
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,380
He's trying to show us the way, look at him.

2567
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:05,460
Look at Kony.

2568
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:07,800
Come back, Kony.

2569
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:10,560
Kony said that definitely don't look for his head.

2570
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:11,080
We should just go.

2571
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:12,880
Okay, okay, okay.

2572
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:16,100
That means he ran somewhere.

2573
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:19,540
He definitely got, like, crumpled somewhere.

2574
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:22,860
I do not want to get you to the end!

2575
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:24,360
Oh, look at that!

2576
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:29,840
I found Kony.

2577
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:36,380
I found him.

2578
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:26,290
What?

2579
02:18:27,630 --> 02:18:29,130
What just happened to me?

2580
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:29,790
I don't know.

2581
02:18:30,430 --> 02:18:31,750
What happened to voice?

2582
02:18:32,110 --> 02:18:33,450
I don't know.

2583
02:18:33,490 --> 02:18:35,570
What just happened to me?

2584
02:18:36,090 --> 02:18:38,090
I teleported.

2585
02:18:38,130 --> 02:18:39,090
How did you do it?

2586
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:40,550
Are you cheating?

2587
02:18:40,750 --> 02:18:41,530
Why are you alive?

2588
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:45,510
You fell off the edge.

2589
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:52,750
Doki, I cannot believe you found me.

2590
02:18:52,810 --> 02:18:53,970
That is insane.

2591
02:18:54,430 --> 02:18:55,470
Where were you?

2592
02:18:55,550 --> 02:18:56,550
You were in the same closet I was in.

2593
02:18:56,890 --> 02:18:59,470
He was in the closet.

2594
02:18:59,890 --> 02:19:00,770
Because I was hiding.

2595
02:19:01,270 --> 02:19:02,670
I was like, I found him.

2596
02:19:03,210 --> 02:19:05,310
I found him.

2597
02:19:05,870 --> 02:19:06,910
Holy shit.

2598
02:19:06,910 --> 02:19:08,730
A gun!

2599
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:09,870
Can I buy it?

2600
02:19:11,070 --> 02:19:12,790
Buy a gun.

2601
02:19:13,350 --> 02:19:14,090
I want the gun.

2602
02:19:14,710 --> 02:19:15,290
It's my gun.

2603
02:19:16,370 --> 02:19:17,450
Let's get ready.

2604
02:19:18,210 --> 02:19:21,090
We have to share 100 HP.

2605
02:19:22,430 --> 02:19:23,410
Put me down.

2606
02:19:23,850 --> 02:19:26,210
We have a gun.

2607
02:19:26,410 --> 02:19:27,930
Let me run to the bathroom real quick.

2608
02:19:28,970 --> 02:19:31,110
It would be nice to be at that sledgehammer.

2609
02:19:31,930 --> 02:19:32,790
Guys, guys, guys.

2610
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:34,350
While he's in the bathroom, quick.

2611
02:19:35,450 --> 02:19:37,290
I'm still fucking here, dude.

2612
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:38,730
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick.

2613
02:19:38,850 --> 02:19:40,970
Go, go, go, go, go.

2614
02:19:40,970 --> 02:19:41,890
He's in the bathroom.

2615
02:19:43,410 --> 02:19:44,910
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2616
02:19:46,950 --> 02:19:48,190
I got him in, I got him in.

2617
02:19:48,210 --> 02:19:49,490
Let me out, let me down.

2618
02:19:49,710 --> 02:19:49,850
No.

2619
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:53,910
He's gotta go potty.

2620
02:19:54,110 --> 02:19:55,690
Time to go potty, little man.

2621
02:19:55,710 --> 02:19:55,990
Don't kiss head.

2622
02:19:57,730 --> 02:19:58,730
Give him a swirly.

2623
02:19:59,610 --> 02:20:00,290
Yeah, dude.

2624
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:01,930
Yeah, dude.

2625
02:20:01,930 --> 02:20:03,070
That's right.

2626
02:20:03,270 --> 02:20:05,370
That's right, dude.

2627
02:20:06,790 --> 02:20:09,090
Let's give him that swirly.

2628
02:20:11,170 --> 02:20:13,210
Get in there, get in there, get in there.

2629
02:20:14,310 --> 02:20:16,250
Time for a swirly, dude.

2630
02:20:17,650 --> 02:20:19,250
It's so gross.

2631
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:21,970
Ow.

2632
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:23,210
All right.

2633
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:24,990
Put Cody in the toilet.

2634
02:20:26,410 --> 02:20:28,090
Put Cody in, put Cody in.

2635
02:20:30,070 --> 02:20:31,110
You're right, you're right.

2636
02:20:31,270 --> 02:20:32,050
Cody's next.

2637
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:33,170
Cody's next.

2638
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:36,810
Put Cody in this one, put Cody in this one.

2639
02:20:37,090 --> 02:20:37,810
That's right.

2640
02:20:38,190 --> 02:20:39,310
Get swirly, dude.

2641
02:20:39,810 --> 02:20:40,810
Get swirly.

2642
02:20:41,370 --> 02:20:41,930
Yeah.

2643
02:20:46,330 --> 02:20:48,210
Gonna pull the handle.

2644
02:20:52,710 --> 02:20:54,810
I tried to save you.

2645
02:20:58,330 --> 02:21:00,810
It's a fucking lie, you know it.

2646
02:21:00,930 --> 02:21:01,970
You laughed.

2647
02:21:02,410 --> 02:21:04,770
You laughed with us.

2648
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:07,030
What was going on?

2649
02:21:08,110 --> 02:21:09,450
Nothing much, nothing much.

2650
02:21:09,770 --> 02:21:11,170
Team bonding, you know.

2651
02:21:12,570 --> 02:21:14,710
Just gave Cody a swirly, felt amazing.

2652
02:21:16,670 --> 02:21:19,190
Is that a high school right there?

2653
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:20,590
Press Q real quick.

2654
02:21:21,070 --> 02:21:22,530
My head stinks now.

2655
02:21:22,690 --> 02:21:23,850
No, I'm not gonna hit Q.

2656
02:21:24,470 --> 02:21:25,490
He actually hit Q.

2657
02:21:26,830 --> 02:21:28,290
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

2658
02:21:28,290 --> 02:21:29,790
I think there's a secret thing up here.

2659
02:21:29,850 --> 02:21:36,370
Five, four, three, two, one.

2660
02:21:42,190 --> 02:21:43,310
I won't forget you, buddy.

2661
02:21:47,850 --> 02:21:48,850
Where's my gun?

2662
02:21:49,290 --> 02:21:50,490
Where's my firearm?

2663
02:21:50,710 --> 02:21:51,470
Don't worry, chat.

2664
02:21:52,570 --> 02:21:54,550
I'm curious, can you shoot me?

2665
02:21:55,390 --> 02:21:55,850
What?

2666
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:57,750
We have limited ammo.

2667
02:21:57,810 --> 02:21:59,550
Do not shoot the gun.

2668
02:21:59,690 --> 02:22:01,490
We have limited ammo.

2669
02:22:02,750 --> 02:22:03,670
Oh, I'm fine.

2670
02:22:03,930 --> 02:22:05,670
I think you missed, Cody.

2671
02:22:05,810 --> 02:22:06,330
Try it again.

2672
02:22:07,730 --> 02:22:09,550
Low HP, there's 50 here.

2673
02:22:09,910 --> 02:22:10,790
Be please.

2674
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:11,530
Shall we?

2675
02:22:14,170 --> 02:22:15,470
Cheers, my friends.

2676
02:22:16,770 --> 02:22:18,870
Does that actually consume my bullet?

2677
02:22:19,570 --> 02:22:20,910
Yes, it does.

2678
02:22:21,070 --> 02:22:21,830
I think it comes back.

2679
02:22:22,130 --> 02:22:22,530
I'm not sure.

2680
02:22:22,530 --> 02:22:25,130
You can refresh it with this machine.

2681
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:26,610
The yellow machine.

2682
02:22:26,850 --> 02:22:30,570
Yeah, but we need to buy the crystals to refresh it.

2683
02:22:31,270 --> 02:22:32,310
Back at Hogwarts.

2684
02:22:32,970 --> 02:22:34,350
Do we have enough crystals for it?

2685
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:36,630
This place was pretty fucked up.

2686
02:22:37,410 --> 02:22:39,790
I'm gonna shoot the shit out of the guy I see.

2687
02:22:39,850 --> 02:22:41,830
We haven't seen the shotgun guy yet, by the way.

2688
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:42,690
Yeah, we haven't.

2689
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:43,930
It's only in the manor.

2690
02:22:44,370 --> 02:22:46,170
It's only in the manor where he appears.

2691
02:22:46,950 --> 02:22:48,270
Oh, I hear a baby left.

2692
02:22:49,010 --> 02:22:49,450
Already?

2693
02:22:49,450 --> 02:22:51,970
Oh, what was that baby?

2694
02:22:52,110 --> 02:22:53,630
Is he...

2695
02:22:53,630 --> 02:22:54,990
Don't go in here, you die.

2696
02:22:55,510 --> 02:22:57,350
There's an extraction here, guys.

2697
02:22:58,050 --> 02:22:58,730
Oh, there is.

2698
02:22:58,790 --> 02:23:00,650
Right away?

2699
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:03,710
That's a fast extraction.

2700
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:18,350
Oh, I saw someone drop something.

2701
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:22,370
I saw someone drop something.

2702
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:26,430
Oh, it's the screamer, it's the screamer.

2703
02:23:28,630 --> 02:23:30,650
Wait, the screamer's already here?

2704
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:38,970
Yeah, I think something happened.

2705
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:39,750
I don't know.

2706
02:23:41,410 --> 02:23:42,650
Anything else here?

2707
02:23:45,710 --> 02:23:46,830
Oh, nice.

2708
02:23:48,350 --> 02:23:50,190
Oh, oh, oh!

2709
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:51,850
Oh, oh!

2710
02:23:52,510 --> 02:23:53,210
Check this!

2711
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:55,290
Oh, no, I threw the gun!

2712
02:23:55,650 --> 02:23:56,770
I threw the gun!

2713
02:23:58,510 --> 02:23:59,830
That's the one thing we have!

2714
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:02,890
Hold on, worry not.

2715
02:24:03,290 --> 02:24:04,470
I'll blast her.

2716
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:07,470
You missed three times in a row.

2717
02:24:08,410 --> 02:24:09,550
And then he died.

2718
02:24:15,860 --> 02:24:17,760
Is he coming here?

2719
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:20,140
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming!

2720
02:24:20,140 --> 02:24:21,000
He's coming!

2721
02:24:34,010 --> 02:24:34,910
Where is he?

2722
02:24:34,990 --> 02:24:35,490
Does anybody know?

2723
02:24:36,210 --> 02:24:38,770
Hey, Kony's dead.

2724
02:24:55,330 --> 02:24:56,410
Don't worry.

2725
02:24:57,110 --> 02:24:58,030
I'll shoot her.

2726
02:24:58,990 --> 02:25:00,530
Yeah, he...

2727
02:25:00,530 --> 02:25:03,890
He missed a couple of shots on her.

2728
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:07,030
Uh, there's a sword.

2729
02:25:07,550 --> 02:25:09,390
I put the sword back, I put the sword in.

2730
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:10,150
Um,

2731
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:57,060
so...

2732
02:25:57,060 --> 02:26:00,760
Um, a monster came in and destroyed all our loot.

2733
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:05,020
Yeah, that happens.

2734
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:07,220
Is that the sword?

2735
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:12,220
Yeah,

2736
02:26:15,700 --> 02:26:17,140
I think I need a little help.

2737
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:21,500
We got no vitamins, no veggies.

2738
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:25,320
Yeah, we gave it to the one guy that died.

2739
02:26:27,060 --> 02:26:29,140
We gave it to the guy that also had a gun.

2740
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:33,160
We also gave him a gun and he still died.

2741
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:35,520
Hey, so this is $16,000.

2742
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:37,240
Right here.

2743
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:38,260
Do we have enough?

2744
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,640
Can we pick this up or no?

2745
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:42,100
I got the head, I got the head.

2746
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:45,500
Wait, guys, this is $16,000.

2747
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:46,540
Can we...

2748
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:48,380
Oh, it looks like we can move it?

2749
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:49,780
Together?

2750
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:50,940
Oh, no, it's on budgeting.

2751
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:52,720
Yeah, it is.

2752
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:55,400
I can't move it, I'm trying to.

2753
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:57,240
I'm moving it.

2754
02:26:57,740 --> 02:27:01,540
Yeah, see, we got it.

2755
02:27:03,700 --> 02:27:07,320
Hey, I didn't see the hole.

2756
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:09,280
Oops.

2757
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:10,900
I don't even think BroPro noticed.

2758
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:13,880
He's gonna be like, wait, where's...

2759
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:17,680
He has no idea what just happened.

2760
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:19,900
He didn't even see the hole.

2761
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:22,240
He didn't even see me.

2762
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,680
I'm in bed.

2763
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:27,320
I'm actually clueless of your presence.

2764
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:29,200
He doesn't know you're dead.

2765
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,820
Hold on, I'm not gonna tell him.

2766
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:32,560
We're gonna come back, I'm not gonna tell him.

2767
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:33,940
I'm gonna be like, oh, shit.

2768
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:35,340
I'm gonna ask him where you are.

2769
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:38,940
Okay, let's go.

2770
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:40,200
Alright, let's go.

2771
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:40,700
Here we go.

2772
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:43,000
Everybody okay?

2773
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:45,040
Are you okay?

2774
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:46,580
Yeah, where's Doki?

2775
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,660
Uh, she went this way, I think.

2776
02:27:58,870 --> 02:27:59,630
She...

2777
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:00,010
went...

2778
02:28:00,770 --> 02:28:01,590
this way.

2779
02:28:02,370 --> 02:28:03,590
I'm so sorry.

2780
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:05,710
I'm so...

2781
02:28:05,710 --> 02:28:07,830
I'm so...

2782
02:28:08,950 --> 02:28:09,710
BroPro?

2783
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:11,290
What happened?

2784
02:28:12,150 --> 02:28:12,570
Me?

2785
02:28:12,770 --> 02:28:13,470
What do you mean?

2786
02:28:13,890 --> 02:28:14,930
You killed her, man.

2787
02:28:15,490 --> 02:28:15,870
How?

2788
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:19,530
Was it you, Kony?

2789
02:28:19,630 --> 02:28:20,310
Did you shoot her?

2790
02:28:20,890 --> 02:28:23,590
This is like an Among Us moment.

2791
02:28:23,590 --> 02:28:23,990
Okay.

2792
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:27,530
I'll show you a clip, please.

2793
02:28:29,370 --> 02:28:31,230
Alright, I found a... what is this?

2794
02:28:31,430 --> 02:28:31,930
A sword!

2795
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:35,190
What happened?

2796
02:28:35,790 --> 02:28:37,130
She went this way.

2797
02:28:37,470 --> 02:28:39,370
I did so bad.

2798
02:28:39,750 --> 02:28:41,590
I did so bad.

2799
02:28:41,730 --> 02:28:42,430
Guys.

2800
02:28:47,710 --> 02:28:48,610
Oh, no.

2801
02:28:49,790 --> 02:28:51,570
I was actually fucked up.

2802
02:28:51,570 --> 02:28:52,190
I got it.

2803
02:28:52,270 --> 02:28:53,250
No, I'm very strong.

2804
02:28:53,390 --> 02:28:54,410
Kony is strongest of all.

2805
02:28:54,490 --> 02:28:55,010
I got it.

2806
02:28:55,870 --> 02:28:57,570
Who wants to play Quidditch?

2807
02:28:58,170 --> 02:28:59,270
I can't believe it.

2808
02:28:59,890 --> 02:29:02,730
I can't believe they did this to me.

2809
02:29:04,290 --> 02:29:07,650
Also, I hope the volume has been okay throughout the stream.

2810
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:11,370
Because that would be awkward if I looked back the stream and you guys couldn't even hear them.

2811
02:29:12,170 --> 02:29:13,570
I mean...

2812
02:29:14,670 --> 02:29:15,550
Only instructions.

2813
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:17,750
Gather it back.

2814
02:29:17,810 --> 02:29:19,090
I'm gonna get one.

2815
02:29:19,090 --> 02:29:19,270
Oh, no.

2816
02:29:22,070 --> 02:29:23,970
I was making tea.

2817
02:29:24,630 --> 02:29:26,910
I think my water has finished boiling.

2818
02:29:29,630 --> 02:29:32,610
Let's go find a couple more trinkets.

2819
02:29:33,270 --> 02:29:34,470
Nothing down that hallway.

2820
02:29:35,430 --> 02:29:36,430
Wait, what was that?

2821
02:29:36,810 --> 02:29:37,710
Oh, you healed me.

2822
02:29:37,770 --> 02:29:38,410
Thank you.

2823
02:29:39,370 --> 02:29:40,710
You, like, jump scared me.

2824
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:41,170
I was like, ah!

2825
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:45,860
Oh, hold on.

2826
02:29:51,740 --> 02:29:52,760
Oh, man.

2827
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:54,280
Oh, shit!

2828
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:56,900
How the fuck did you die?

2829
02:29:57,400 --> 02:29:58,500
Deserved, honestly.

2830
02:29:59,160 --> 02:29:59,720
Fucking deserved.

2831
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:01,220
How did you die?

2832
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:03,540
How did you die?

2833
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:05,320
I got shot!

2834
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:07,360
Wait, the shotgun guy?

2835
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:08,580
Yes!

2836
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:10,280
Oh, fucking funny!

2837
02:30:12,660 --> 02:30:14,480
I can't believe...

2838
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:16,200
I can't believe...

2839
02:30:16,200 --> 02:30:18,420
I was trolling and then I turned around.

2840
02:30:19,300 --> 02:30:20,280
That's karma.

2841
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:21,920
That's actual karma.

2842
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:25,740
You could have told me about the fucking pit!

2843
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,900
Motherfucker that scared the fuck out of me!

2844
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:32,920
Holy fucking shit!

2845
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:33,900
What was that?

2846
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:35,520
Wait, how did you all die?

2847
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:37,360
Was it shotgun guy?

2848
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:39,380
There's shotgun guy.

2849
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:40,520
It's fucking over.

2850
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:41,080
Look at this.

2851
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:45,180
He's gonna try to kill shotgun guy.

2852
02:30:45,180 --> 02:30:48,540
Wait, if you kill shotgun guy, shotgun guy no clipped.

2853
02:30:49,380 --> 02:30:50,200
Wait, actually.

2854
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:51,580
He's like under the map.

2855
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:52,940
Wait, really?

2856
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:54,620
Yeah.

2857
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:58,260
I told you he was strong.

2858
02:30:58,760 --> 02:31:00,260
I got baby jump scared.

2859
02:31:00,580 --> 02:31:02,140
You like disappeared so fast.

2860
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:05,100
Gordon has 1 HP, by the way.

2861
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:06,100
Oh my god.

2862
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:08,840
He's blind.

2863
02:31:09,860 --> 02:31:11,060
Yeah, yeah, that's why you don't talk.

2864
02:31:11,440 --> 02:31:12,360
Or I guess you could do that.

2865
02:31:12,360 --> 02:31:13,680
He's trying to kill him?

2866
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:15,520
No, he's trying to bait him.

2867
02:31:18,460 --> 02:31:20,260
He's been playing too much repo.

2868
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:21,080
You know it.

2869
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:25,360
Welcome back to the watch replay repo stream.

2870
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:26,700
He's the hunter.

2871
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:29,200
He's the predator.

2872
02:31:29,660 --> 02:31:32,120
This predator versus humans right now.

2873
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:36,200
Yeah, he's like a tiger and flying right now.

2874
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:38,960
Oh my god.

2875
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:39,820
Oh my god.

2876
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:42,400
Bro, what the fuck is he doing?

2877
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:43,400
There's the other way.

2878
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:46,360
This and the taking the item.

2879
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:48,380
I don't understand the game.

2880
02:31:49,180 --> 02:31:50,480
But maybe he's just better than me.

2881
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:52,480
What is he doing?

2882
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:54,940
He's trying to bait the shot.

2883
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:55,620
Why?

2884
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:57,800
He could go the other way.

2885
02:31:58,560 --> 02:32:00,560
No, he has unlimited bullets.

2886
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:04,980
He could go the other way.

2887
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:06,320
There's another way to go up.

2888
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,260
I need 7k.

2889
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:14,280
That went pretty well.

2890
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:25,760
What did he say?

2891
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:27,820
The hard spawn.

2892
02:32:28,420 --> 02:32:29,380
Something about a hard spawn.

2893
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:31,740
He said something about a bow tie.

2894
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:32,500
I don't know what that means.

2895
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:35,640
I was like, why is he talking about the bow tie?

2896
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:37,000
What the fuck is a bow tie?

2897
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:39,240
I don't know.

2898
02:32:39,240 --> 02:32:41,360
Is he talking repo right now to us?

2899
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:44,140
I don't know the meta.

2900
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:45,560
I don't know that term.

2901
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:49,620
Why did he just bring the cart over just for one day?

2902
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:52,660
I don't understand.

2903
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,480
Before he kills himself when we respawn.

2904
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:02,400
Did he gain like 2% extra speed by doing that?

2905
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:03,000
I don't understand.

2906
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,780
I don't understand either.

2907
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:07,180
I'm so confused.

2908
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:11,600
You know, I'm surprised how far we made it.

2909
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:12,300
Not gonna lie.

2910
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:13,280
I thought we were done.

2911
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:16,040
Yeah, me too.

2912
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:18,160
I thought level 2 was it for us.

2913
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:20,720
I did not think we would survive this long.

2914
02:33:22,260 --> 02:33:23,940
Level 8 is crazy.

2915
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:26,460
What's world record?

2916
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:28,520
It might be.

2917
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:29,440
We're closing in.

2918
02:33:31,100 --> 02:33:32,140
I've seen...

2919
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:33,840
I've seen...

2920
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:36,540
Toast got to level 15.

2921
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:38,140
15?

2922
02:33:38,740 --> 02:33:39,040
Yeah.

2923
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:42,700
He actually constructed the most try-hard group he could get.

2924
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,960
Everyone was literally just trying their best.

2925
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:50,300
Not like us where we try to sabotage each other.

2926
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:51,060
And kill each other.

2927
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,040
I think that's what makes it so incredible.

2928
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:55,900
We were walking around.

2929
02:33:56,860 --> 02:33:58,760
You got me killed, bro.

2930
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,580
I thought you killed yourself.

2931
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:01,420
Oh, wow.

2932
02:34:02,480 --> 02:34:02,860
Wow.

2933
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:06,860
Other people that they got him killed.

2934
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:07,600
Wow.

2935
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:10,780
The reason I asked you where Doki was.

2936
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:12,220
You guys were carrying that item.

2937
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:13,680
And she fell into the pit.

2938
02:34:13,780 --> 02:34:14,580
And you didn't notice.

2939
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:15,880
You just took the pit.

2940
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:19,700
I need you to react to that clip.

2941
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:21,600
It was so funny.

2942
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:23,600
We were like, wait, where's Doki?

2943
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:24,980
She fell into the pit.

2944
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:25,940
You didn't even see it.

2945
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:26,920
She just disappeared.

2946
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:28,400
I was dying.

2947
02:34:28,780 --> 02:34:29,860
It was so funny.

2948
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:33,820
And then you didn't even grab my head.

2949
02:34:33,980 --> 02:34:36,380
You didn't know you were dead.

2950
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:37,640
Playing the game.

2951
02:34:40,340 --> 02:34:43,180
And then you lied to Cody and Matt.

2952
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:45,740
It was like, I think she went that way.

2953
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:53,820
Why would I just disappear?

2954
02:34:55,940 --> 02:34:56,580
Turn around.

2955
02:34:56,900 --> 02:34:58,600
I think she went that way and left.

2956
02:34:59,140 --> 02:35:00,440
It just got quiet.

2957
02:35:00,900 --> 02:35:03,460
It's gone and it's quiet.

2958
02:35:03,980 --> 02:35:05,080
It got real quiet.

2959
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:07,100
It got real quiet.

2960
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,700
It didn't speak for the rest of the round.

2961
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:12,920
That's not what happened.

2962
02:35:13,540 --> 02:35:15,120
That's not what happened.

2963
02:35:15,540 --> 02:35:16,900
That's $8,000.

2964
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:18,360
Is he going to do it?

2965
02:35:20,260 --> 02:35:21,380
He's doing his best.

2966
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:22,080
He's looking around.

2967
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:26,040
There's like three giant monsters running around.

2968
02:35:27,100 --> 02:35:28,640
I can't even see the map.

2969
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:30,640
I don't know what there is left.

2970
02:35:31,340 --> 02:35:33,720
I wish I could see the map, but I guess that would be cheating.

2971
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:38,500
Call her invisible woman the way she disappeared.

2972
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:41,400
What am I?

2973
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:41,880
Invisible?

2974
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:46,100
Dude, those characters are so annoying.

2975
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:51,000
Invisible woman is like, should I give them the count to four?

2976
02:35:53,160 --> 02:35:54,860
That's not a normal sentence.

2977
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:56,200
Why are you doing that?

2978
02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:02,980
Her husband has one pit and she's like ride or die.

2979
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:10,760
You're just jealous of Mr. Fantastic.

2980
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:13,080
Who wouldn't be?

2981
02:36:13,700 --> 02:36:17,740
I was telling Tony my first floor was Mr. Fantastic.

2982
02:36:19,300 --> 02:36:20,360
He's fun.

2983
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:22,120
He's just bad.

2984
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:22,860
He's ass.

2985
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:26,580
He's pretty terrible, but he's fun.

2986
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:28,560
Oh, Cody, I got Celestial.

2987
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:31,840
Good shit.

2988
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:32,760
Did you get it solo?

2989
02:36:34,440 --> 02:36:35,480
Uh, yeah.

2990
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:38,700
If you cheated, just say it, because I cheated.

2991
02:36:40,440 --> 02:36:42,240
Cody, you can't do that.

2992
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:42,520
I cheated.

2993
02:36:42,740 --> 02:36:43,320
I don't care.

2994
02:36:45,940 --> 02:36:47,420
I just duo'd.

2995
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:49,020
Duo is half cheating.

2996
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:51,220
Cody six stacked.

2997
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:52,080
I was there.

2998
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:54,940
I was there.

2999
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:58,080
I was there on an alt account.

3000
02:36:58,740 --> 02:37:00,420
No, that's cheating.

3001
02:37:00,980 --> 02:37:02,000
Wait a second.

3002
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:03,640
Wait, that's extra cheating.

3003
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:11,140
We put super goblins on an alt account too.

3004
02:37:12,460 --> 02:37:13,980
Oh my god.

3005
02:37:13,980 --> 02:37:16,200
Cobus on an alt is illegal.

3006
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:21,960
Cody is Celestial too.

3007
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:23,460
Celestial too, baby.

3008
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:24,720
That's crazy.

3009
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:26,780
Okay, I guess I got to start cheating.

3010
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:28,660
I got to start.

3011
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:31,920
I was going to say ask J3, but he's been hard stuck Celestial.

3012
02:37:32,220 --> 02:37:33,380
So I don't think...

3013
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,100
Why is he bringing the car for?

3014
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:41,680
We don't know.

3015
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:42,680
For real.

3016
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:44,300
We'll never know.

3017
02:37:45,100 --> 02:37:47,500
We don't know the mind inside Void.

3018
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:48,960
We'll never know.

3019
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:51,540
I can never understand the level of gamer he's at.

3020
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:52,660
I thought I was a gamer.

3021
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:55,500
Chat's like, let him cook.

3022
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:57,080
Let him cook.

3023
02:37:58,100 --> 02:37:59,900
He is so dead.

3024
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:00,760
He doesn't see it.

3025
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:02,160
It's right there.

3026
02:38:02,900 --> 02:38:04,180
What is that?

3027
02:38:04,300 --> 02:38:06,420
We're having fun and Void has locked the fuck in.

3028
02:38:09,020 --> 02:38:10,800
Is that anxiety?

3029
02:38:11,260 --> 02:38:13,140
It was supposed to be just us four initially.

3030
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:15,180
I don't think...

3031
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:17,580
If we didn't have Void, we won't make it to level A.

3032
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:18,560
I'm going to say it.

3033
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:24,540
When he dies, we should all be really mad.

3034
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:26,200
Strangely.

3035
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:29,280
Irrationally angry at him for losing.

3036
02:38:30,940 --> 02:38:31,860
Oh, he's dead.

3037
02:38:31,980 --> 02:38:32,960
Oh my God.

3038
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:35,180
He's trying to push it into the paint.

3039
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:36,400
He's pulling so hard.

3040
02:38:37,020 --> 02:38:37,720
It's over.

3041
02:38:38,380 --> 02:38:39,380
There's no way.

3042
02:38:39,540 --> 02:38:40,340
He just forgot about him.

3043
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:41,400
He's just clipping.

3044
02:38:42,840 --> 02:38:43,700
He's playing.

3045
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:48,780
He's playing FGC right now.

3046
02:38:49,800 --> 02:38:51,800
He just backed up.

3047
02:38:52,100 --> 02:38:53,060
He's cheating.

3048
02:38:53,380 --> 02:38:54,660
He just walked through a wall.

3049
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:57,600
Oh my God.

3050
02:38:57,860 --> 02:38:58,680
Look at that.

3051
02:39:00,820 --> 02:39:03,420
What kind of fighting game is he playing right now?

3052
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:05,220
What kind of fighting game player is he?

3053
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:05,780
He's cheating.

3054
02:39:06,500 --> 02:39:08,200
Which FGC is he?

3055
02:39:08,380 --> 02:39:11,280
Those are good foot C's.

3056
02:39:11,380 --> 02:39:14,200
What FGC is Void from?

3057
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:16,440
He's a smash guy.

3058
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:17,780
He's a smash guy?

3059
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:19,160
Why can't you do that?

3060
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:22,320
Back in Brawl.

3061
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:24,120
Back in Brawl.

3062
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:27,060
See me in Brawl at Project M.

3063
02:39:27,220 --> 02:39:28,040
Oh my God.

3064
02:39:29,500 --> 02:39:31,980
You say that with Brawl throw in the call.

3065
02:39:34,420 --> 02:39:38,260
Which version of smash is he from?

3066
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:40,020
Void did a smash 4 and ultimate.

3067
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:42,120
Is that better or worse than yours?

3068
02:39:43,100 --> 02:39:43,620
Way worse.

3069
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:44,780
Void is a shotgun guy.

3070
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:47,760
They made the game way easier to play.

3071
02:39:49,220 --> 02:39:53,260
Can the shotgun guy shoot the ghoul monster thing?

3072
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:53,480
Yeah.

3073
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:55,880
There's like friendly fire.

3074
02:39:56,740 --> 02:39:57,860
What is he doing?

3075
02:39:58,400 --> 02:39:59,400
He's offering him a drink.

3076
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:00,420
I don't know actually.

3077
02:40:00,520 --> 02:40:01,960
I don't remember if there is friendly fire.

3078
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:05,280
I don't know.

3079
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:06,660
I know that we can shoot him.

3080
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:11,200
Oh by the way, that gun is a bait.

3081
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:12,500
Do not use the gun.

3082
02:40:12,620 --> 02:40:13,680
That shit is ass.

3083
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:14,780
Really?

3084
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:15,140
Why?

3085
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:17,140
I shot that ghost 3 times.

3086
02:40:17,240 --> 02:40:18,600
4 times dead on.

3087
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:20,280
Didn't even flinch.

3088
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:25,640
I was thinking you missed the first shot.

3089
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:29,220
You gotta upgrade the gun first.

3090
02:40:29,220 --> 02:40:34,200
I saw you missed him.

3091
02:40:34,480 --> 02:40:35,020
I saw you missed him.

3092
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:35,740
I lasered that ghost.

3093
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:36,540
Hit scan.

3094
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:38,420
No, hit scan laser.

3095
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:39,240
No.

3096
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:42,500
Play the clip.

3097
02:40:43,180 --> 02:40:44,660
Play the clip.

3098
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:46,460
I will send it to everyone.

3099
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Also who shoots a ghost?

3100
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:50,300
Why would you shoot that?

3101
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:50,740
What the hell?

3102
02:40:51,380 --> 02:40:53,560
What is that?

3103
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:56,000
What is that?

3104
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,140
He fell down the stairs.

3105
02:40:58,280 --> 02:40:59,620
And he tried to throw him in the pit.

3106
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:02,960
What is that thing?

3107
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:05,420
He is banking on shotgun guy kill.

3108
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:06,300
For the final ones.

3109
02:41:06,700 --> 02:41:08,580
He is getting clipped guys.

3110
02:41:08,900 --> 02:41:10,560
He is trying to farm a clip right now.

3111
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:14,880
Why did he fall down the stairs?

3112
02:41:15,140 --> 02:41:16,940
He is blind.

3113
02:41:17,660 --> 02:41:18,580
He is blind.

3114
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:21,080
This is the common issue with him.

3115
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:22,240
I am so serious.

3116
02:41:22,240 --> 02:41:24,440
He does not see the things that are in front of him.

3117
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:27,520
But he is so good at literally everything else.

3118
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:30,020
He is daredevil.

3119
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:31,720
He is daredevil.

3120
02:41:35,780 --> 02:41:38,160
Why the fuck did we pick him?

3121
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:44,300
I needed him to survive.

3122
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:45,700
Right behind him.

3123
02:41:45,820 --> 02:41:47,180
Did you see it?

3124
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:49,960
He actually went for the speed play.

3125
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:50,700
And did not get punished.

3126
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:56,340
How is he clipping through the map?

3127
02:41:58,780 --> 02:42:01,300
What is he doing man?

3128
02:42:02,620 --> 02:42:05,180
Imagine if Void had all the stamina.

3129
02:42:05,480 --> 02:42:06,280
And all the health.

3130
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:08,340
Imagine if he was the Bidoof.

3131
02:42:08,900 --> 02:42:11,380
He would not be doing shit.

3132
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:13,020
He would not be doing nothing.

3133
02:42:14,660 --> 02:42:16,500
I will just stay.

3134
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:20,820
He is so mad.

3135
02:42:21,740 --> 02:42:22,900
This is huge.

3136
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:25,240
I got to fucking carry these guys again.

3137
02:42:26,300 --> 02:42:28,200
Wait, that thing is usually worth like 6k.

3138
02:42:28,860 --> 02:42:29,840
Hey Treyarch.

3139
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:30,780
Thanks for the raid.

3140
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:32,560
We are playing repo.

3141
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:34,500
I am doing really good.

3142
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:36,040
I am doing really good.

3143
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:39,420
Wait, did Coney die first?

3144
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:40,440
No.

3145
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:43,440
Dude, I did not get any bombs.

3146
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:45,600
This is Coney smurfing right now.

3147
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:48,140
He is dual boxing.

3148
02:42:55,060 --> 02:42:55,760
He has two pieces.

3149
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:59,740
Is that on TikTok?

3150
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:08,960
Coney and his TikTok reacts.

3151
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:12,440
Coney and his TikTok reacts.

3152
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:13,100
Right there.

3153
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:15,280
They got the thing.

3154
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:15,880
Oh my god.

3155
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,560
There is no world.

3156
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:24,500
That

3157
02:43:27,980 --> 02:43:29,960
shit sounded good as hell.

3158
02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:32,080
I know that shit felt good as hell.

3159
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:33,820
That is the good shit.

3160
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:41,060
The hardest hit of his life.

3161
02:43:43,460 --> 02:43:46,860
He is relaxed now.

3162
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:48,880
He got sent to another dimension.

3163
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:50,320
Shall we?

3164
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:53,340
He hit that shit hard.

3165
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:56,320
Oh my god.

3166
02:43:58,560 --> 02:44:03,420
He made it.

3167
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:04,160
That is crazy.

3168
02:44:05,640 --> 02:44:10,100
That fucking sigh.

3169
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,040
He is missing a head.

3170
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:15,620
He is missing a head.

3171
02:44:15,980 --> 02:44:19,560
It is Matt's head.

3172
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:20,540
It is your head.

3173
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:23,420
Goodbye, Matt.

3174
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:24,420
Goodbye.

3175
02:44:26,930 --> 02:44:28,380
Let's get back in there.

3176
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:34,580
Holy shit.

3177
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:36,280
Bored again.

3178
02:44:37,100 --> 02:44:38,340
Bored again.

3179
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:39,300
Bored again.

3180
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:39,340
We did it.

3181
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:43,000
We did it.

3182
02:44:44,120 --> 02:44:45,940
You were missing Matt.

3183
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:47,060
We did it.

3184
02:44:47,100 --> 02:44:48,240
It was a team effort.

3185
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:49,240
We did it.

3186
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:53,180
All of us together.

3187
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:56,440
Push me.

3188
02:44:58,600 --> 02:45:00,280
He can't get me in the cart.

3189
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:03,060
Push me.

3190
02:45:03,060 --> 02:45:04,120
Push me.

3191
02:45:05,160 --> 02:45:06,280
Push me.

3192
02:45:06,560 --> 02:45:07,900
All right.

3193
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,100
Let's go.

3194
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:11,160
We did it, guys.

3195
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:12,540
It is such a dire spot.

3196
02:45:12,620 --> 02:45:14,640
It would be very funny to push the cart into the lava.

3197
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:17,240
I was thinking about it.

3198
02:45:17,500 --> 02:45:18,560
No, no, no.

3199
02:45:18,740 --> 02:45:19,720
Don't do it.

3200
02:45:20,480 --> 02:45:22,580
This will take me to 100k YouTube.

3201
02:45:23,100 --> 02:45:26,020
I will let it go.

3202
02:45:26,380 --> 02:45:30,100
We didn't ask Matt where he died.

3203
02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:31,460
A nun?

3204
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:33,460
There it is.

3205
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:40,880
And the gun guy.

3206
02:45:42,460 --> 02:45:45,280
Can the nun make noise so the gun guy shoots her?

3207
02:45:49,420 --> 02:45:50,580
Shut up.

3208
02:45:50,680 --> 02:45:52,300
The gun guy is right there.

3209
02:46:51,340 --> 02:46:53,420
Oh my God.

3210
02:46:53,760 --> 02:46:54,560
Oh my God.

3211
02:46:56,180 --> 02:46:57,980
Is it Tony, Dad?

3212
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:00,580
Is it Tony, Dad?

3213
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:14,960
I am sorry.

3214
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:24,810
I need a minute.

3215
02:47:27,970 --> 02:47:28,250
I'm just gonna pause for a minute.

3216
02:47:29,290 --> 02:47:30,130
Wait a minute...

3217
02:47:31,670 --> 02:47:32,810
Oh my god!

3218
02:47:34,730 --> 02:47:36,550
I can't, I can't!

3219
02:47:37,190 --> 02:47:39,150
She said don't pause!

3220
02:47:40,050 --> 02:47:41,930
I can't do this!

3221
02:47:42,310 --> 02:47:43,650
There's tears in my eyes!

3222
02:47:44,450 --> 02:47:46,170
I'm looking crazy!

3223
02:47:46,330 --> 02:47:48,470
I'm looking crazy!

3224
02:47:48,470 --> 02:47:52,270
My face looks like a loser.

3225
02:47:52,770 --> 02:47:52,850
My face looks like a loser.

3226
02:47:53,710 --> 02:47:54,290
I can't!

3227
02:47:54,410 --> 02:47:57,290
I'm trying not to laugh too loud.

3228
02:47:57,290 --> 02:47:58,530
I got snot everywhere.

3229
02:47:58,570 --> 02:47:59,650
I need help.

3230
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,350
Fuck man.

3231
02:48:07,890 --> 02:48:09,690
Oh fuck.

3232
02:48:14,150 --> 02:48:16,350
Why did he make noise?

3233
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:24,330
I can't, I can't.

3234
02:48:24,330 --> 02:48:25,250
I'm crying.

3235
02:48:26,750 --> 02:48:28,650
Holy fuck, I'm crying.

3236
02:49:12,990 --> 02:49:17,370
I'm gonna fucking die.

3237
02:49:18,250 --> 02:49:18,850
I can't.

3238
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:20,810
I can't.

3239
02:49:20,870 --> 02:49:23,050
I hope this is the level where we die.

3240
02:49:33,830 --> 02:49:35,670
I can't anymore.

3241
02:49:38,270 --> 02:49:39,530
Oh my god.

3242
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:42,090
I actually can't.

3243
02:49:44,610 --> 02:49:46,570
God, that shit fucking killed me.

3244
02:49:55,750 --> 02:49:57,190
There's nothing here.

3245
02:49:57,430 --> 02:49:59,050
Why did it take me to the high ground?

3246
02:50:02,150 --> 02:50:04,250
Oh my god.

3247
02:50:04,550 --> 02:50:07,750
The hardest part was trying not to laugh too loud.

3248
02:50:07,910 --> 02:50:09,190
Because of the fucking...

3249
02:50:09,790 --> 02:50:11,430
The fucking shotgun.

3250
02:50:24,940 --> 02:50:25,740
God.

3251
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:28,700
Don't get in.

3252
02:50:32,360 --> 02:50:34,480
Truly a real one.

3253
02:50:38,820 --> 02:50:41,060
You're still alive.

3254
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:27,940
Maybe you guys are alive.

3255
02:51:35,010 --> 02:51:36,770
Hold on, I have to fix my face.

3256
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:50,540
There's a broom nearby.

3257
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:52,240
I saw.

3258
02:51:53,380 --> 02:51:54,560
It's like right here.

3259
02:51:57,810 --> 02:52:00,030
I wonder if there's anything extra here.

3260
02:52:01,610 --> 02:52:02,630
There's a cube.

3261
02:52:03,270 --> 02:52:04,190
10k cube.

3262
02:52:05,810 --> 02:52:07,150
I need help.

3263
02:52:11,330 --> 02:52:12,490
You need help?

3264
02:52:13,750 --> 02:52:15,190
10k cube.

3265
02:52:16,250 --> 02:52:18,710
Trying to reset myself after that day.

3266
02:52:20,690 --> 02:52:22,130
Teamwork makes the dream work.

3267
02:52:26,950 --> 02:52:30,730
I can go this way.

3268
02:52:30,730 --> 02:52:37,120
Oh, we're bringing Kony back.

3269
02:52:42,800 --> 02:52:43,740
Nice.

3270
02:52:45,880 --> 02:52:47,980
Okay, welcome back Kony.

3271
02:52:48,060 --> 02:52:48,900
Nice.

3272
02:52:49,460 --> 02:52:50,540
Let's go.

3273
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:52,200
We're finally all back.

3274
02:52:52,260 --> 02:52:54,240
We're all back together.

3275
02:52:54,720 --> 02:52:55,580
Let's go.

3276
02:52:57,340 --> 02:52:58,260
Oh my god.

3277
02:52:58,280 --> 02:52:59,780
We have one more.

3278
02:53:00,060 --> 02:53:02,060
We have one more to go.

3279
02:53:10,580 --> 02:53:15,260
I'm not kidding.

3280
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,020
We might actually just be fucked if he comes in here.

3281
02:53:20,360 --> 02:53:21,400
Guys, we might be fucked.

3282
02:53:21,800 --> 02:53:23,040
Guys, we might be fucked.

3283
02:53:23,660 --> 02:53:24,280
Bye bye.

3284
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:24,960
Look

3285
02:53:50,810 --> 02:53:52,530
what I found.

3286
02:53:52,530 --> 02:53:53,810
Oh my god.

3287
02:53:54,610 --> 02:53:55,250
There.

3288
02:53:56,770 --> 02:53:58,510
I won't forget you buddy.

3289
02:53:59,310 --> 02:54:00,450
Yeah, that was fucked up.

3290
02:54:00,670 --> 02:54:01,370
I won't bring you back.

3291
02:54:07,630 --> 02:54:09,890
That wasn't bad that time.

3292
02:54:10,390 --> 02:54:13,850
He was the one that warned us.

3293
02:54:15,810 --> 02:54:17,070
There's nothing up top.

3294
02:54:17,070 --> 02:54:18,090
There's nothing up there.

3295
02:54:19,070 --> 02:54:20,450
No, no, no.

3296
02:54:20,490 --> 02:54:21,610
I'm going to double check.

3297
02:54:28,810 --> 02:54:29,250
Woah.

3298
02:54:32,410 --> 02:54:34,110
No, he's alive and he's coming this way.

3299
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:45,000
Sacrifice.

3300
02:56:27,770 --> 02:56:28,690
He was looking at you and then screaming.

3301
02:56:29,930 --> 02:56:31,970
So he would shoot you.

3302
02:56:32,590 --> 02:56:39,590
Is he

3303
02:57:06,980 --> 02:57:07,760
still there?

3304
02:57:08,300 --> 02:57:09,320
Is he still there?

3305
02:57:35,820 --> 02:57:36,580
Fear.

3306
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:43,620
Lots and lots of fear.

3307
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:29,360
I don't know how he died.

3308
02:58:43,460 --> 02:58:45,640
I don't know how he died.

3309
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:47,940
He just...

3310
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:50,240
Showed up dead.

3311
02:59:02,500 --> 02:59:05,560
Oh god, he's still alive.

3312
02:59:05,560 --> 02:59:05,720
I'm scared.

3313
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:07,320
I can't

3314
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:26,020
do this one by one.

3315
02:59:27,620 --> 02:59:28,900
He has the cart.

3316
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:31,900
I hope he finds his way here.

3317
02:59:38,780 --> 02:59:39,520
I'm scared.

3318
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:42,780
I'm so scared.

3319
02:59:59,780 --> 03:00:00,920
Is it a child?

3320
03:01:06,900 --> 03:01:08,640
How much is in there?

3321
03:01:09,440 --> 03:01:10,320
Oh, you're here.

3322
03:01:10,320 --> 03:01:12,120
I'm still alive.

3323
03:01:13,220 --> 03:01:13,320
Okay.

3324
03:01:14,380 --> 03:01:21,280
There is a ghost on high ground.

3325
03:01:21,440 --> 03:01:21,840
Oh, he's here.

3326
03:01:38,450 --> 03:01:40,850
Is the child still there?

3327
03:01:44,870 --> 03:01:47,070
Oh no, not the baby.

3328
03:01:47,070 --> 03:01:49,770
Not the baby.

3329
03:01:49,770 --> 03:01:50,630
Not the baby.

3330
03:01:55,890 --> 03:01:57,290
Okay.

3331
03:02:14,290 --> 03:02:14,990
Crap.

3332
03:02:14,990 --> 03:02:16,570
Not

3333
03:02:30,320 --> 03:02:31,000
the baby.

3334
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:31,500
Gone.

3335
03:02:34,540 --> 03:02:36,440
Is baby not gone?

3336
03:02:37,220 --> 03:02:38,040
What is it?

3337
03:04:29,780 --> 03:04:30,240
Oh.

3338
03:04:34,310 --> 03:04:35,590
Anything up here?

3339
03:04:46,020 --> 03:04:47,020
Nothing.

3340
03:04:51,250 --> 03:04:52,670
Not one item.

3341
03:05:10,310 --> 03:05:11,810
I'm safe.

3342
03:07:20,350 --> 03:07:21,000
Okay.

3343
03:07:25,680 --> 03:07:28,460
I don't remember where the broom is.

3344
03:07:29,100 --> 03:07:30,400
I don't remember.

3345
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:35,100
It was so long ago.

3346
03:16:46,040 --> 03:16:48,640
Thank you.

3347
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:56,820
That was crazy.

3348
03:16:56,820 --> 03:16:57,220
I'm scared.

3349
03:17:00,720 --> 03:17:03,260
I'm scared again.

3350
03:17:08,260 --> 03:17:11,320
Scatter, scatter.

3351
03:17:16,780 --> 03:17:18,180
I

3352
03:19:05,820 --> 03:19:07,500
don't care.

3353
03:19:08,380 --> 03:19:09,440
I don't care.

3354
03:19:24,200 --> 03:19:25,500
Oh my god.

3355
03:19:26,180 --> 03:19:28,000
Are you okay?

3356
03:19:28,260 --> 03:19:29,000
No, I'm not.

3357
03:19:29,620 --> 03:19:30,860
I'm not okay.

3358
03:19:31,620 --> 03:19:33,080
Coney's dead too.

3359
03:19:33,660 --> 03:19:34,680
Coney died?

3360
03:19:38,340 --> 03:19:39,660
I got shot.

3361
03:19:40,080 --> 03:19:41,640
I don't even know where he was.

3362
03:19:41,880 --> 03:19:42,600
I got sniped.

3363
03:19:44,060 --> 03:19:45,840
That was unbelievable.

3364
03:19:46,360 --> 03:19:50,000
Coney, how the fuck did you die there when you said you were safe?

3365
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:51,840
You were like...

3366
03:19:51,840 --> 03:19:53,920
No, I went that far.

3367
03:19:54,400 --> 03:19:55,880
When it was us two.

3368
03:19:56,120 --> 03:19:58,220
And then you were like, I think the baby's gone.

3369
03:19:58,380 --> 03:20:00,260
And then you fucking died.

3370
03:20:00,400 --> 03:20:02,000
I fell down.

3371
03:20:03,100 --> 03:20:03,840
I fell down.

3372
03:20:04,160 --> 03:20:05,460
Juice box, please.

3373
03:20:07,100 --> 03:20:10,280
After everything you fucking fell.

3374
03:20:10,860 --> 03:20:12,020
Me and my juice.

3375
03:20:12,520 --> 03:20:13,600
Juice, please.

3376
03:20:13,980 --> 03:20:15,020
He's ignoring it.

3377
03:20:15,820 --> 03:20:16,660
Yummy pear.

3378
03:20:18,320 --> 03:20:20,000
More for Coney.

3379
03:20:20,360 --> 03:20:21,500
Guys, we need HP.

3380
03:20:22,500 --> 03:20:23,860
We need HP.

3381
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:25,740
I can't do this.

3382
03:20:26,640 --> 03:20:32,020
Health upgrade for Coney.

3383
03:20:33,020 --> 03:20:34,480
Alright, I'm hitting the button.

3384
03:20:35,240 --> 03:20:35,560
Yeah, go ahead.

3385
03:20:36,380 --> 03:20:39,180
Wait, there's an indestructible drone.

3386
03:20:41,720 --> 03:20:43,780
Should we have bought that?

3387
03:20:43,780 --> 03:20:45,120
That's really good.

3388
03:20:45,140 --> 03:20:48,180
We could have bought the indestructible drone.

3389
03:20:49,820 --> 03:20:51,240
It's really good.

3390
03:20:51,240 --> 03:20:52,920
It's okay, Coney got his...

3391
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:57,080
It's okay, Coney got his juice box, guys.

3392
03:20:57,380 --> 03:20:58,840
I have my juice box.

3393
03:20:59,180 --> 03:21:00,860
I'm gonna be really strong.

3394
03:21:02,260 --> 03:21:03,800
I'm gonna be really strong.

3395
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:08,040
He's gonna be the biggest boy out there.

3396
03:21:08,600 --> 03:21:10,620
I got my gummy worms.

3397
03:21:10,620 --> 03:21:12,840
Don't worry.

3398
03:21:12,860 --> 03:21:14,860
He got his vitamin C.

3399
03:21:15,400 --> 03:21:19,780
Guys, I think I deserve one of the health packs.

3400
03:21:23,100 --> 03:21:24,520
Bro, I am so strong.

3401
03:21:24,820 --> 03:21:25,800
Oh my god.

3402
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:28,420
I am unbelievably powerful.

3403
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:30,660
Holy shit.

3404
03:21:31,240 --> 03:21:32,820
What did you do, Coney?

3405
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:34,340
What did you do?

3406
03:21:34,380 --> 03:21:36,040
I fell into the lava.

3407
03:21:36,040 --> 03:21:38,040
That's what happened.

3408
03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:42,180
Alright, I hit my power spike.

3409
03:21:42,420 --> 03:21:43,380
Yup, we're good to go.

3410
03:21:44,980 --> 03:21:46,120
I got my items.

3411
03:21:46,360 --> 03:21:47,160
I got my items.

3412
03:21:51,380 --> 03:21:57,820
We made it to level 9, guys.

3413
03:21:58,100 --> 03:22:00,220
That's actually kind of nice.

3414
03:22:00,420 --> 03:22:01,260
We had quite a run.

3415
03:22:01,380 --> 03:22:03,160
We had quite a first run.

3416
03:22:03,160 --> 03:22:04,260
I have a trophy.

3417
03:22:04,540 --> 03:22:05,880
Look, it's my oshi mark.

3418
03:22:05,960 --> 03:22:06,460
It's me.

3419
03:22:09,080 --> 03:22:10,100
It's me.

3420
03:22:11,500 --> 03:22:13,540
Oh, this is the same map we were in earlier.

3421
03:22:21,090 --> 03:22:25,730
I feel like I aged like 50 years playing this one mode.

3422
03:22:27,110 --> 03:22:30,330
I'm aging as we play right now.

3423
03:22:38,890 --> 03:22:41,430
Maybe I should just die so I can relax.

3424
03:22:45,630 --> 03:22:47,630
Oh my god.

3425
03:22:47,870 --> 03:22:49,550
What the fuck?

3426
03:22:51,230 --> 03:22:53,450
The fuck is this hellhole?

3427
03:22:56,190 --> 03:22:58,230
We can fall down, right?

3428
03:22:58,370 --> 03:22:59,030
Will we die?

3429
03:23:00,650 --> 03:23:02,050
Is it parkour?

3430
03:23:02,310 --> 03:23:02,850
I can't tell.

3431
03:23:03,830 --> 03:23:05,850
I can't tell if it's parkour.

3432
03:23:05,850 --> 03:23:06,050
Okay.

3433
03:23:08,230 --> 03:23:09,790
Guys, I'm so tired.

3434
03:23:10,550 --> 03:23:11,950
Guys, wait, let me...

3435
03:23:13,270 --> 03:23:13,950
Guys...

3436
03:23:13,950 --> 03:23:18,690
I think I gotta change real quick to something more appropriate after what Kony...

3437
03:23:18,690 --> 03:23:24,590
What Kony brought got me through.

3438
03:23:25,050 --> 03:23:26,330
Give me a sec.

3439
03:23:27,010 --> 03:23:29,370
I need to change real quick.

3440
03:23:31,130 --> 03:23:32,430
Where is it?

3441
03:23:33,250 --> 03:23:34,030
Don't wait.

3442
03:23:40,450 --> 03:23:40,850
Okay.

3443
03:23:44,630 --> 03:23:46,830
Oh hey, we already got the first one.

3444
03:23:47,730 --> 03:23:47,930
Oh.

3445
03:23:48,150 --> 03:23:50,030
I came here assuming this was extraction.

3446
03:23:50,450 --> 03:23:51,570
I think this is extraction.

3447
03:23:51,810 --> 03:23:52,790
Yeah, there it is.

3448
03:23:54,830 --> 03:23:55,470
Wait, what happened?

3449
03:23:55,750 --> 03:23:57,070
We were doing it, now we're not.

3450
03:23:57,670 --> 03:23:58,170
There you go.

3451
03:23:59,890 --> 03:24:00,510
Wait, what?

3452
03:24:01,470 --> 03:24:02,610
That's what I'm saying, what happened?

3453
03:24:02,770 --> 03:24:03,390
What did they do?

3454
03:24:03,390 --> 03:24:04,770
They crushed it.

3455
03:24:04,770 --> 03:24:06,050
They crushed it.

3456
03:24:06,050 --> 03:24:06,730
No fucking way.

3457
03:24:07,110 --> 03:24:07,670
They crushed the cart.

3458
03:24:07,950 --> 03:24:08,790
I'm done.

3459
03:24:09,070 --> 03:24:10,570
I think they crushed the cart.

3460
03:24:10,990 --> 03:24:12,450
I think they...

3461
03:24:13,350 --> 03:24:14,930
Oh my god.

3462
03:24:15,370 --> 03:24:19,130
They crushed it.

3463
03:24:26,120 --> 03:24:30,600
I leave them alone for one...

3464
03:24:30,600 --> 03:24:32,280
for five minutes.

3465
03:24:32,580 --> 03:24:34,420
I... Kony, what happened?

3466
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:35,280
Kony, what happened?

3467
03:24:35,340 --> 03:24:36,480
Kony, look into my eyes.

3468
03:24:36,480 --> 03:24:40,080
Kony, look into my eyes and tell me what happened.

3469
03:24:42,420 --> 03:24:44,640
Kony, look into my eyes.

3470
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:47,860
Look into my eyes and tell me what happened.

3471
03:24:47,860 --> 03:24:50,780
That's really weird, that must be a glitch.

3472
03:24:51,200 --> 03:24:51,680
I don't know.

3473
03:24:53,460 --> 03:24:54,600
What happened, bro?

3474
03:24:54,820 --> 03:24:55,800
What happened?

3475
03:24:57,260 --> 03:24:59,520
Void is hearing things, so I just left him.

3476
03:25:05,590 --> 03:25:07,630
I don't think we're gonna make it, then.

3477
03:25:08,970 --> 03:25:09,710
We got it.

3478
03:25:10,590 --> 03:25:11,430
We got it.

3479
03:25:15,500 --> 03:25:15,940
10k.

3480
03:25:16,980 --> 03:25:21,920
So something definitely got crushed, cause we had 19k earlier.

3481
03:25:23,520 --> 03:25:23,720
Yeah.

3482
03:25:24,060 --> 03:25:24,700
You got it?

3483
03:25:24,840 --> 03:25:25,420
Yeah, I got it.

3484
03:25:25,980 --> 03:25:26,820
Okay, thank you.

3485
03:25:28,540 --> 03:25:30,060
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the thing.

3486
03:25:30,140 --> 03:25:31,300
I don't want it destroying our items.

3487
03:25:38,980 --> 03:25:40,780
Alright, we got 10k.

3488
03:25:45,490 --> 03:25:47,410
Bro, this is a small map.

3489
03:25:48,010 --> 03:25:48,590
No, there's more.

3490
03:25:48,710 --> 03:25:49,350
There's more stuff.

3491
03:25:49,510 --> 03:25:50,410
There's downstairs.

3492
03:25:55,170 --> 03:25:55,690
Okay.

3493
03:25:56,710 --> 03:25:58,390
I wonder what got destroyed, guys.

3494
03:25:59,010 --> 03:25:59,310
I wonder.

3495
03:26:02,770 --> 03:26:04,370
Wait, it's 16k?

3496
03:26:05,210 --> 03:26:06,670
I thought we got 10k.

3497
03:26:09,230 --> 03:26:09,590
What?

3498
03:26:10,210 --> 03:26:13,050
Is it 6k in there?

3499
03:26:17,250 --> 03:26:18,910
We need 3k.

3500
03:26:20,910 --> 03:26:22,030
We need 3k.

3501
03:26:22,890 --> 03:26:23,410
3k?

3502
03:26:24,010 --> 03:26:24,730
Yeah.

3503
03:26:27,090 --> 03:26:31,240
I'm so tired.

3504
03:26:33,320 --> 03:26:34,440
I'm so tired.

3505
03:26:39,480 --> 03:26:40,460
Wait, what?

3506
03:26:41,300 --> 03:26:42,480
Wait, how did he die?

3507
03:26:43,380 --> 03:26:43,960
I don't know.

3508
03:26:44,060 --> 03:26:45,220
I think he fell in the water.

3509
03:26:45,920 --> 03:26:46,800
There's water?

3510
03:26:48,400 --> 03:26:50,160
Yeah, where the vents are.

3511
03:26:51,040 --> 03:26:53,160
Oh, did he jump down?

3512
03:26:54,760 --> 03:26:56,160
It's safe down here.

3513
03:26:56,220 --> 03:26:56,940
You can jump down.

3514
03:26:58,440 --> 03:27:00,480
How did Matt die?

3515
03:27:06,780 --> 03:27:08,960
I'm so tired, guys.

3516
03:27:09,660 --> 03:27:11,940
I'm so very tired.

3517
03:27:14,360 --> 03:27:19,120
I'm so very tired.

3518
03:27:20,860 --> 03:27:21,140
I had to do that one.

3519
03:27:21,480 --> 03:27:23,920
I had to do that twice.

3520
03:27:24,580 --> 03:27:28,080
Before he did it once, I had to do it twice.

3521
03:27:37,260 --> 03:27:40,920
I'll make it up to my team.

3522
03:27:41,400 --> 03:27:41,980
Check this out.

3523
03:27:42,360 --> 03:27:43,700
I don't like that sound.

3524
03:27:49,830 --> 03:27:51,740
I don't like that sound.

3525
03:27:52,540 --> 03:27:53,580
Do you need help?

3526
03:27:54,260 --> 03:27:54,840
No.

3527
03:27:54,840 --> 03:27:56,850
Okay, you big strong man.

3528
03:27:58,400 --> 03:27:58,860
Okay.

3529
03:28:02,940 --> 03:28:04,800
Is there something in there?

3530
03:28:05,220 --> 03:28:05,920
What the fuck?

3531
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:07,120
I'm not doing anything.

3532
03:28:08,740 --> 03:28:10,180
I'm putting it in the lava.

3533
03:28:10,560 --> 03:28:13,000
This is stupid.

3534
03:28:13,260 --> 03:28:14,520
I'm not even doing anything.

3535
03:28:15,680 --> 03:28:17,320
It's not going to go back into the vault.

3536
03:28:17,500 --> 03:28:18,540
Get the fuck out of here.

3537
03:28:18,800 --> 03:28:18,940
What?

3538
03:28:24,840 --> 03:28:25,320
Yo.

3539
03:28:26,610 --> 03:28:27,900
He got scared.

3540
03:28:28,280 --> 03:28:29,540
He got scared.

3541
03:28:30,160 --> 03:28:32,160
That was Doki.

3542
03:28:32,500 --> 03:28:33,620
She got scared.

3543
03:28:34,340 --> 03:28:35,260
She jumped down.

3544
03:28:35,700 --> 03:28:37,120
I got pushed.

3545
03:28:37,560 --> 03:28:38,260
I got pushed.

3546
03:28:41,220 --> 03:28:42,660
That's what happened to me.

3547
03:28:42,920 --> 03:28:44,020
He picked up my seat.

3548
03:28:46,630 --> 03:28:47,960
There's an invisible man.

3549
03:28:48,360 --> 03:28:49,680
He grabbed me.

3550
03:28:49,760 --> 03:28:51,080
That's what happened to me.

3551
03:28:51,080 --> 03:28:53,480
I got grabbed.

3552
03:28:53,600 --> 03:28:54,420
There's Doki's head.

3553
03:28:55,260 --> 03:28:56,600
There's an invisible man?

3554
03:28:56,820 --> 03:29:00,200
Yes, I got kidnapped by an invisible man.

3555
03:29:00,280 --> 03:29:00,540
What?

3556
03:29:01,460 --> 03:29:03,940
I got stranger endangered.

3557
03:29:05,760 --> 03:29:07,220
Wait, Kony saw that.

3558
03:29:07,220 --> 03:29:08,800
Oh my god, Kony has no idea.

3559
03:29:08,880 --> 03:29:10,480
It's time for me to save the day.

3560
03:29:10,700 --> 03:29:11,460
I dropped Doki's head.

3561
03:29:13,500 --> 03:29:14,060
Hello?

3562
03:29:15,060 --> 03:29:15,620
Hi.

3563
03:29:18,120 --> 03:29:19,820
I thought there was no fall damage.

3564
03:29:19,820 --> 03:29:22,600
I fell from a high point with one HP and I died.

3565
03:29:23,600 --> 03:29:24,980
I'm about to fall off.

3566
03:29:25,440 --> 03:29:27,500
I think this is the run.

3567
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:30,140
I don't think we're gonna make it, guys.

3568
03:29:30,520 --> 03:29:31,180
Don't do that.

3569
03:29:31,620 --> 03:29:33,040
But we always say that.

3570
03:29:33,880 --> 03:29:35,580
I think this is the run.

3571
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:37,860
Kony only needs 2k.

3572
03:29:38,700 --> 03:29:39,920
Why are you saying he?

3573
03:29:40,040 --> 03:29:41,000
We have Void here.

3574
03:29:42,760 --> 03:29:46,000
Void was just talking about jumping off and killing himself right there.

3575
03:29:46,340 --> 03:29:47,380
So that's why.

3576
03:29:47,380 --> 03:29:50,060
I'm gonna use the bat.

3577
03:29:50,160 --> 03:29:53,320
There's invisible men and then there's pits.

3578
03:29:53,540 --> 03:29:55,960
They grabbed me and threw me in the pit.

3579
03:29:56,260 --> 03:29:57,760
What do I do?

3580
03:29:58,880 --> 03:30:00,580
I don't even know what you're saying.

3581
03:30:00,740 --> 03:30:01,620
I'm not gonna lie.

3582
03:30:01,960 --> 03:30:05,340
The invisible man grabbed me and threw me in the pit.

3583
03:30:05,600 --> 03:30:06,740
What do I do?

3584
03:30:08,300 --> 03:30:08,780
Disappear.

3585
03:30:09,640 --> 03:30:10,120
Disappear.

3586
03:30:12,120 --> 03:30:13,760
He hit me in.

3587
03:30:13,780 --> 03:30:15,460
I don't know where you are, but watch out.

3588
03:30:15,460 --> 03:30:17,280
Hey, what's up?

3589
03:30:17,320 --> 03:30:18,320
Watch out, I have money.

3590
03:30:18,560 --> 03:30:21,160
And he grabbed me, but not Kony.

3591
03:30:23,460 --> 03:30:25,100
Kony was infected.

3592
03:30:25,340 --> 03:30:26,180
He probably scared him.

3593
03:30:28,820 --> 03:30:29,980
No way.

3594
03:30:30,860 --> 03:30:32,800
They're 30 tens off.

3595
03:30:33,160 --> 03:30:33,580
What?

3596
03:30:34,560 --> 03:30:35,440
Give me $30.

3597
03:30:37,440 --> 03:30:38,740
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3598
03:30:39,820 --> 03:30:43,500
I'm in the room where Matt died.

3599
03:30:43,500 --> 03:30:44,340
They can't hear me.

3600
03:30:45,160 --> 03:30:48,940
They just said that Zoki and I are in the extraction room.

3601
03:30:49,080 --> 03:30:50,280
I'm fucking dead, brother.

3602
03:30:57,040 --> 03:30:58,780
Wait, is that $20?

3603
03:30:59,380 --> 03:31:01,140
Or $20,000?

3604
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:03,200
Just $20,000, right?

3605
03:31:03,760 --> 03:31:04,340
That's weird.

3606
03:31:04,540 --> 03:31:05,720
We just need $0.35.

3607
03:31:06,540 --> 03:31:07,260
Kony has it.

3608
03:31:07,360 --> 03:31:13,240
It might be $20,000.

3609
03:31:20,110 --> 03:31:21,390
Cocktails, mixtures, ice.

3610
03:31:21,930 --> 03:31:23,230
Snacks, so... none.

3611
03:31:24,490 --> 03:31:25,810
Soda, sour, mixed, dry.

3612
03:31:26,430 --> 03:31:27,510
Lit, you can't deny.

3613
03:31:28,370 --> 03:31:30,050
Whatever you want, whatever you need.

3614
03:31:30,050 --> 03:31:31,390
Watch out, that's very fragile.

3615
03:31:33,370 --> 03:31:34,390
I'm back.

3616
03:31:35,630 --> 03:31:37,370
Is Kony doing it?

3617
03:31:37,410 --> 03:31:38,370
Is he doing it?

3618
03:31:39,010 --> 03:31:40,350
Kony hit his clutch moment.

3619
03:31:40,730 --> 03:31:42,390
He's singing the Bernice song.

3620
03:31:44,970 --> 03:31:47,070
I should not shake that around.

3621
03:31:47,070 --> 03:31:47,710
Oh, God.

3622
03:31:53,920 --> 03:31:55,560
He's doing it.

3623
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:57,560
We're gonna be back.

3624
03:31:58,680 --> 03:31:59,500
Born again.

3625
03:31:59,800 --> 03:32:00,640
We're born again.

3626
03:32:01,160 --> 03:32:02,060
Born again.

3627
03:32:07,100 --> 03:32:11,960
We're born again.

3628
03:32:14,420 --> 03:32:16,440
Thank you, Konymeister.

3629
03:32:16,440 --> 03:32:18,800
Wow, Kony, my savior.

3630
03:32:19,540 --> 03:32:20,020
Wow.

3631
03:32:20,480 --> 03:32:22,440
What could we do without you?

3632
03:32:24,160 --> 03:32:26,320
Kony, it turns out there is fall damage.

3633
03:32:26,520 --> 03:32:28,480
Do not fall from a high place on 1 HP.

3634
03:32:29,100 --> 03:32:30,080
Good to know.

3635
03:32:30,760 --> 03:32:31,980
I don't know where Brawl Pro is.

3636
03:32:32,180 --> 03:32:33,560
I still don't know where he's headed.

3637
03:32:34,180 --> 03:32:34,920
Oh, wait.

3638
03:32:35,080 --> 03:32:36,600
Oh, Brawl Pro was not picked up.

3639
03:32:41,540 --> 03:32:43,120
Where's the other extraction point?

3640
03:32:43,160 --> 03:32:43,500
I forgot.

3641
03:32:44,440 --> 03:32:45,160
Oh, it's over there.

3642
03:32:48,530 --> 03:32:52,090
We're born again.

3643
03:32:54,550 --> 03:32:55,410
Born again.

3644
03:32:55,510 --> 03:33:02,130
Anyone for tea?

3645
03:33:03,890 --> 03:33:05,870
Would anyone like some tea?

3646
03:33:08,030 --> 03:33:08,450
Tea?

3647
03:33:10,750 --> 03:33:13,050
Nobody liked my tea joke.

3648
03:33:13,050 --> 03:33:14,870
No, we did not.

3649
03:33:14,930 --> 03:33:15,450
I didn't.

3650
03:33:16,790 --> 03:33:18,430
I didn't like it.

3651
03:33:20,690 --> 03:33:22,310
Where do we go for more?

3652
03:33:22,390 --> 03:33:23,450
Oh, there's more stuff here.

3653
03:33:31,520 --> 03:33:33,640
I got 2.6 here.

3654
03:33:36,200 --> 03:33:37,480
And then...

3655
03:33:37,480 --> 03:33:38,800
There's another one here?

3656
03:33:41,640 --> 03:33:42,280
Yeah.

3657
03:33:47,780 --> 03:33:47,860
Yeah.

3658
03:33:49,780 --> 03:33:50,300
Nevermind.

3659
03:33:52,580 --> 03:33:54,200
Wait, what do you mean?

3660
03:33:55,320 --> 03:33:56,960
I found his head!

3661
03:33:57,340 --> 03:33:58,400
What happened to MatMan?

3662
03:33:59,020 --> 03:34:00,060
What the fuck?

3663
03:34:01,320 --> 03:34:02,300
Wait, wait, wait.

3664
03:34:03,440 --> 03:34:04,640
Wait, how did he die?

3665
03:34:05,300 --> 03:34:06,740
I don't know how MatMan died.

3666
03:34:06,820 --> 03:34:07,320
What server?

3667
03:34:07,460 --> 03:34:08,200
What are you talking about?

3668
03:34:09,820 --> 03:34:10,340
Damn.

3669
03:34:14,280 --> 03:34:15,000
Damn.

3670
03:34:16,120 --> 03:34:16,840
Damn.

3671
03:34:16,840 --> 03:34:17,920
How did he die already?

3672
03:34:23,780 --> 03:34:25,580
I got a big boy box.

3673
03:34:25,940 --> 03:34:28,180
I got a big boy box.

3674
03:34:28,300 --> 03:34:29,220
I'm ready.

3675
03:34:29,900 --> 03:34:31,140
I'm a big boy.

3676
03:34:31,400 --> 03:34:33,180
Carrying my big boy box.

3677
03:34:33,300 --> 03:34:35,700
And I'm gonna make it there.

3678
03:34:36,480 --> 03:34:37,960
Big boy time.

3679
03:34:38,280 --> 03:34:39,480
Big boy journey.

3680
03:34:41,500 --> 03:34:42,960
Oh my god.

3681
03:34:43,040 --> 03:34:43,980
Bigger boy.

3682
03:34:47,280 --> 03:34:49,420
The strongest boy up there.

3683
03:34:57,770 --> 03:34:59,630
Oh, I found the other extraction.

3684
03:35:01,730 --> 03:35:05,170
I'm so scared of the invisible man.

3685
03:35:05,330 --> 03:35:06,770
There's so many pits.

3686
03:35:06,990 --> 03:35:08,930
For this invisible man.

3687
03:35:10,350 --> 03:35:12,210
There's so many holes.

3688
03:35:12,210 --> 03:35:14,050
He could just pick one of us up.

3689
03:35:14,190 --> 03:35:15,090
And kill us.

3690
03:35:16,170 --> 03:35:17,130
Is that what he does?

3691
03:35:17,370 --> 03:35:18,850
Yeah, that's what happened to me.

3692
03:35:19,330 --> 03:35:20,570
He chucked me into the hole.

3693
03:35:23,190 --> 03:35:24,190
Don't touch the nose!

3694
03:35:26,150 --> 03:35:27,430
I'm behind you, behind you, behind you.

3695
03:35:28,490 --> 03:35:30,350
Wait, what happens when you touch the nose?

3696
03:35:31,210 --> 03:35:32,950
I think he blows up or something.

3697
03:35:36,960 --> 03:35:38,080
Ew, what is that?

3698
03:35:38,480 --> 03:35:39,860
Oh, that's the mouth thing.

3699
03:35:40,880 --> 03:35:42,500
Don't go in the pit, don't go in the pit.

3700
03:35:44,800 --> 03:35:46,780
Don't you dare come up here with me.

3701
03:35:46,780 --> 03:35:47,800
Don't you dare.

3702
03:35:48,720 --> 03:35:50,260
Fight your own battle.

3703
03:35:50,540 --> 03:35:52,400
He chose both of us.

3704
03:35:52,480 --> 03:35:53,240
We're both involved.

3705
03:35:54,180 --> 03:35:56,320
We were both involved in this fight.

3706
03:35:57,180 --> 03:35:57,900
No, no, no.

3707
03:35:59,280 --> 03:36:01,020
We're both in this together.

3708
03:36:01,440 --> 03:36:03,160
Oh my god, now he's chasing me.

3709
03:36:03,240 --> 03:36:03,680
He's camping.

3710
03:36:05,720 --> 03:36:07,000
Alright, there's a monkey doll.

3711
03:36:07,120 --> 03:36:07,780
We could get that.

3712
03:36:08,120 --> 03:36:08,840
No way.

3713
03:36:11,420 --> 03:36:13,240
I got the monkey doll.

3714
03:36:14,440 --> 03:36:15,420
Okay, I'm stuck.

3715
03:36:17,500 --> 03:36:19,840
I think he's like locked here.

3716
03:36:20,060 --> 03:36:21,300
Okay, he's good.

3717
03:36:21,540 --> 03:36:23,280
I got the monkey doll.

3718
03:36:24,740 --> 03:36:26,640
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.

3719
03:36:27,380 --> 03:36:29,740
I got the monkey doll.

3720
03:36:30,020 --> 03:36:35,040
Okay, that's 2k.

3721
03:36:36,140 --> 03:36:38,320
Yeah, we need a little more.

3722
03:36:38,680 --> 03:36:39,060
Okay.

3723
03:36:39,480 --> 03:36:43,940
I don't think we're gonna get enough items by the way.

3724
03:36:43,940 --> 03:36:46,920
My chat is telling me that if I slam...

3725
03:36:46,920 --> 03:36:49,380
No, there's items on this place.

3726
03:36:49,700 --> 03:36:53,940
My chat is telling me if I grab this guy and I slam him up and down, I'll kill him.

3727
03:36:57,370 --> 03:36:57,630
Whoa.

3728
03:36:58,130 --> 03:36:59,230
Doll, doll, doll.

3729
03:37:01,410 --> 03:37:02,310
Oh my god, dude.

3730
03:37:02,430 --> 03:37:03,010
No, stop.

3731
03:37:04,150 --> 03:37:05,750
Sorry man, I had a long night.

3732
03:37:06,250 --> 03:37:08,130
Ew, you sound gross.

3733
03:37:08,990 --> 03:37:10,630
Dude, don't make fun of me.

3734
03:37:11,230 --> 03:37:12,590
Yeah, I've been working on it.

3735
03:37:12,590 --> 03:37:13,430
Ew.

3736
03:37:15,610 --> 03:37:16,870
Wait, can you control me?

3737
03:37:17,070 --> 03:37:19,890
Because when I was possessed, he tried to throw me into a pit.

3738
03:37:21,530 --> 03:37:23,630
No, no, I think you were doing it yourself.

3739
03:37:24,190 --> 03:37:25,330
Oh, I did that, okay.

3740
03:37:26,530 --> 03:37:28,090
Oh shit, the clown lady gets hurt.

3741
03:37:29,170 --> 03:37:29,530
Yeah.

3742
03:37:34,070 --> 03:37:35,910
Well, it sounded kind of handsome actually.

3743
03:37:36,970 --> 03:37:38,910
What's gonna fucking die?

3744
03:37:39,790 --> 03:37:40,650
No, he'll fight.

3745
03:37:40,650 --> 03:37:41,670
He'll fight, he'll win this.

3746
03:37:41,890 --> 03:37:43,130
Oh my god.

3747
03:37:46,010 --> 03:37:47,490
I can't read

3748
03:37:55,870 --> 03:37:56,350
it.

3749
03:37:57,930 --> 03:37:59,810
That's an awesome last word.

3750
03:38:00,870 --> 03:38:02,150
Oh my god.

3751
03:38:02,250 --> 03:38:03,210
And then he just fell.

3752
03:38:04,110 --> 03:38:05,010
Oh, that was good.

3753
03:38:05,210 --> 03:38:06,770
Wait, is that the invisible man?

3754
03:38:08,370 --> 03:38:10,430
That was really good.

3755
03:38:32,410 --> 03:38:33,310
What is this?

3756
03:38:33,390 --> 03:38:35,130
Yo, celebrate!

3757
03:38:36,170 --> 03:38:37,470
Yeah, let's go!

3758
03:38:38,470 --> 03:38:38,870
Celebration!

3759
03:38:45,240 --> 03:38:45,640
Alright.

3760
03:38:59,000 --> 03:38:59,840
I got his head.

3761
03:38:59,940 --> 03:39:00,980
No, I got it, I got it.

3762
03:39:01,020 --> 03:39:01,960
Alright, you push the cart.

3763
03:39:05,500 --> 03:39:07,700
No, no, that's already...

3764
03:39:07,700 --> 03:39:08,940
We just need a 2k.

3765
03:39:10,520 --> 03:39:11,320
Yeah, it's fine.

3766
03:39:11,320 --> 03:39:13,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3767
03:39:13,700 --> 03:39:16,060
So what happened to that server, Kony?

3768
03:39:17,180 --> 03:39:18,220
The server.

3769
03:39:20,400 --> 03:39:24,660
Oh, I see, I see.

3770
03:39:25,100 --> 03:39:27,480
So nothing bad happened to it.

3771
03:39:29,760 --> 03:39:29,900
Yeah.

3772
03:39:32,600 --> 03:39:33,820
Oh, I see.

3773
03:39:34,200 --> 03:39:35,400
So how come like...

3774
03:39:35,400 --> 03:39:40,520
So like, how come it was at like 19k at one point and then went back to 1k?

3775
03:39:41,460 --> 03:39:43,180
Oh, we didn't order that much food.

3776
03:39:43,280 --> 03:39:43,760
What do you mean?

3777
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:46,300
We got like some appetizers.

3778
03:39:46,540 --> 03:39:47,340
Just some appies?

3779
03:39:48,380 --> 03:39:50,860
Yeah, just some mozzies and a bloomin' onion.

3780
03:39:51,120 --> 03:39:51,560
Whoa!

3781
03:39:51,840 --> 03:39:52,860
How much was it in total?

3782
03:39:52,980 --> 03:39:53,680
Was it 1k?

3783
03:39:54,280 --> 03:39:57,040
I don't know what money's like in Canada.

3784
03:39:57,240 --> 03:39:58,480
You guys have loonies and toonies.

3785
03:39:58,700 --> 03:40:00,020
I don't think it went that high.

3786
03:40:00,620 --> 03:40:01,240
I don't know.

3787
03:40:03,160 --> 03:40:04,680
Alright, let's res our friends.

3788
03:40:05,320 --> 03:40:06,960
Does this work if I push it?

3789
03:40:06,960 --> 03:40:08,540
Yeah, just push it.

3790
03:40:09,060 --> 03:40:11,980
Because, you know, if something broke, that'd be very...

3791
03:40:11,980 --> 03:40:13,620
Yeah, something broke.

3792
03:40:14,700 --> 03:40:14,900
Oh!

3793
03:40:21,440 --> 03:40:21,760
Okay.

3794
03:40:23,540 --> 03:40:25,740
That was very scary.

3795
03:40:27,480 --> 03:40:28,920
This game is scary!

3796
03:40:31,420 --> 03:40:32,240
Is that everything?

3797
03:40:32,780 --> 03:40:35,080
Wait, you have health!

3798
03:40:35,260 --> 03:40:36,300
Cody, give me HP!

3799
03:40:37,580 --> 03:40:38,780
I'm bored, I'm dead!

3800
03:40:38,780 --> 03:40:40,460
Cody, give me HP!

3801
03:40:40,880 --> 03:40:43,800
You have 70 HP at least!

3802
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:46,480
Cody is full HP!

3803
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:48,620
Cody is almost full HP!

3804
03:40:49,800 --> 03:40:52,940
Heal me, heal me!

3805
03:40:53,480 --> 03:40:54,840
Cody, where did he go?

3806
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:57,640
Where the fuck did this fucker go?

3807
03:40:58,220 --> 03:41:01,440
I have been turbo 1 HP for the past 7 levels.

3808
03:41:01,480 --> 03:41:02,700
You know what his HP is?

3809
03:41:03,380 --> 03:41:04,660
He never helps!

3810
03:41:11,440 --> 03:41:12,140
Alright.

3811
03:41:12,560 --> 03:41:14,600
Guess I'll take the cart over there.

3812
03:41:19,930 --> 03:41:21,810
Oh, I hope they live.

3813
03:41:30,810 --> 03:41:32,100
Hope he's alive.

3814
03:41:39,320 --> 03:41:41,480
I know this one was an extraction.

3815
03:41:44,020 --> 03:41:46,120
I have no idea they're alive.

3816
03:41:47,780 --> 03:41:50,680
I know Cody is fucking hiding somewhere.

3817
03:41:54,080 --> 03:41:55,980
Oh yeah, I know.

3818
03:41:56,120 --> 03:41:58,080
I was not going to be there for that.

3819
03:41:59,080 --> 03:42:00,760
I already got kidnapped once.

3820
03:42:00,880 --> 03:42:02,260
I learned my lesson.

3821
03:42:02,460 --> 03:42:03,220
Stranger danger.

3822
03:42:13,620 --> 03:42:15,280
There's a bonsai tree.

3823
03:42:15,540 --> 03:42:16,860
I don't think we're going to make it.

3824
03:42:16,920 --> 03:42:18,600
We broke a lot of stuff today.

3825
03:42:19,840 --> 03:42:22,420
We broke a lot of stuff.

3826
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:27,620
I don't think we're going to find enough gas.

3827
03:42:28,880 --> 03:42:30,360
Whoa, we got split up.

3828
03:42:30,380 --> 03:42:30,960
That's weird.

3829
03:42:33,240 --> 03:42:33,840
Dude.

3830
03:42:35,340 --> 03:42:36,960
Okay, I didn't even touch it.

3831
03:42:37,140 --> 03:42:38,040
It fell from the sky.

3832
03:42:38,640 --> 03:42:39,980
Touched my neck right now.

3833
03:42:40,600 --> 03:42:44,400
You have 121 HP, Cody.

3834
03:42:44,960 --> 03:42:47,620
Give me at least 10.

3835
03:42:48,040 --> 03:42:49,460
Cody, don't make me.

3836
03:42:50,480 --> 03:42:52,360
Don't make me do it.

3837
03:42:55,080 --> 03:42:57,820
Give me my HP.

3838
03:42:58,020 --> 03:42:59,040
Give me my HP right now.

3839
03:43:01,760 --> 03:43:04,500
You know how much HP Cody has?

3840
03:43:05,060 --> 03:43:06,020
Do you know how much HP?

3841
03:43:06,620 --> 03:43:08,280
Yeah, I checked his streak.

3842
03:43:08,460 --> 03:43:09,560
It's like 180.

3843
03:43:14,320 --> 03:43:19,340
Cody, at least use your big boy streak for this fucking ice cube.

3844
03:43:19,480 --> 03:43:19,900
Cody.

3845
03:43:21,620 --> 03:43:24,240
Use your big boy streak right now.

3846
03:43:25,320 --> 03:43:26,960
I got a monkey.

3847
03:43:28,040 --> 03:43:29,760
We don't need the monkey.

3848
03:43:29,920 --> 03:43:30,600
This is 10k.

3849
03:43:31,620 --> 03:43:32,840
Monkey goes in the car.

3850
03:43:33,180 --> 03:43:34,160
Oh, this?

3851
03:43:35,600 --> 03:43:36,320
Worry not.

3852
03:43:36,480 --> 03:43:37,560
I will carry it.

3853
03:43:38,340 --> 03:43:40,000
With great ease.

3854
03:43:41,400 --> 03:43:42,660
Pony is strongest of all.

3855
03:43:44,680 --> 03:43:46,020
I'm scared.

3856
03:43:46,680 --> 03:43:47,160
What?

3857
03:43:47,240 --> 03:43:50,920
What was that scream?

3858
03:43:57,920 --> 03:43:59,220
Is this enough?

3859
03:43:59,480 --> 03:44:00,340
This is more than enough.

3860
03:44:00,660 --> 03:44:02,100
We don't know where Brofist Head is though, no?

3861
03:44:02,860 --> 03:44:04,360
It's fine, we just gotta...

3862
03:44:04,360 --> 03:44:05,340
What is happening here?

3863
03:44:06,480 --> 03:44:07,920
Who is this?

3864
03:44:08,480 --> 03:44:09,540
Get out of the corner.

3865
03:44:09,780 --> 03:44:11,280
What did you do, buddy?

3866
03:44:13,220 --> 03:44:14,360
Get out of the corner.

3867
03:44:15,560 --> 03:44:16,420
Get out of the corner.

3868
03:44:17,660 --> 03:44:18,200
Oh shit.

3869
03:44:18,260 --> 03:44:19,380
I got some HP.

3870
03:44:20,200 --> 03:44:22,340
You gave me HP back.

3871
03:44:22,780 --> 03:44:24,640
Wait, I feel better now.

3872
03:44:24,640 --> 03:44:26,400
I feel better now actually.

3873
03:44:27,020 --> 03:44:27,560
Wait.

3874
03:44:29,240 --> 03:44:30,220
I got some HP.

3875
03:44:30,640 --> 03:44:33,100
An actual checkmate situation.

3876
03:44:34,900 --> 03:44:36,460
All I needed was my friend.

3877
03:44:36,460 --> 03:44:38,690
How do you like it?

3878
03:44:39,140 --> 03:44:40,900
How do you like it?

3879
03:44:41,680 --> 03:44:43,220
How do you like it?

3880
03:44:43,220 --> 03:44:44,140
How do you like it?

3881
03:44:44,480 --> 03:44:48,040
You're gonna die with that 180 HP.

3882
03:44:48,780 --> 03:44:52,460
You're gonna die with that HP and I know it.

3883
03:44:54,760 --> 03:44:56,260
Hold on, this is 10k.

3884
03:44:56,960 --> 03:44:59,220
What happened to Brofist Head?

3885
03:44:59,340 --> 03:45:01,760
I have no idea.

3886
03:45:01,900 --> 03:45:03,440
Why would you put it on the spear?

3887
03:45:03,440 --> 03:45:04,600
It's okay, it's okay.

3888
03:45:04,660 --> 03:45:05,720
Get out, get out.

3889
03:45:06,140 --> 03:45:07,500
Alright, turn around.

3890
03:45:08,220 --> 03:45:08,560
Alright.

3891
03:45:09,900 --> 03:45:10,600
Here you go.

3892
03:45:11,360 --> 03:45:12,460
What the fuck?

3893
03:45:12,460 --> 03:45:13,620
I'm healing.

3894
03:45:14,560 --> 03:45:16,420
There you go, even split.

3895
03:45:19,620 --> 03:45:20,220
Yoink.

3896
03:45:21,360 --> 03:45:21,860
Nice.

3897
03:45:22,700 --> 03:45:24,360
Alright, we have 4k in here.

3898
03:45:24,480 --> 03:45:26,300
We just need another...

3899
03:45:26,300 --> 03:45:29,160
What even happened to Brofist Head?

3900
03:45:29,160 --> 03:45:31,040
We don't know, nobody knows.

3901
03:45:31,040 --> 03:45:32,620
He just disappeared.

3902
03:45:42,320 --> 03:45:44,660
What did you do, boy?

3903
03:45:46,700 --> 03:45:47,520
Can't relate.

3904
03:45:48,620 --> 03:45:50,320
I'm talking about how Kony's a gigadad.

3905
03:45:50,940 --> 03:45:51,620
Weakass.

3906
03:45:52,200 --> 03:45:53,120
Nothing, dude.

3907
03:45:53,780 --> 03:45:55,840
Wait, it says there's something here.

3908
03:45:55,900 --> 03:45:57,100
Oh my god.

3909
03:45:57,920 --> 03:45:59,460
There's a spinning propane tank.

3910
03:45:59,800 --> 03:46:03,200
Don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

3911
03:46:03,200 --> 03:46:05,740
But it's so valuable, wait.

3912
03:46:06,220 --> 03:46:08,240
Oh, it's gonna kill us.

3913
03:46:08,980 --> 03:46:11,160
Oh my god, oh my god.

3914
03:46:11,460 --> 03:46:12,160
Is it empty?

3915
03:46:13,240 --> 03:46:15,220
Uh, it'll probably be lighter.

3916
03:46:17,300 --> 03:46:19,760
I didn't like that sound.

3917
03:46:20,200 --> 03:46:21,320
Oh, Kony, Kony!

3918
03:46:21,400 --> 03:46:22,180
Come over here!

3919
03:46:25,400 --> 03:46:26,080
Kony!

3920
03:46:26,740 --> 03:46:28,680
We need big boy Kony!

3921
03:46:28,680 --> 03:46:28,760
Kony!

3922
03:46:30,400 --> 03:46:32,920
Yeah, there's a couple big things here.

3923
03:46:38,160 --> 03:46:41,260
Kony, there's another server for you to break.

3924
03:46:42,480 --> 03:46:44,340
That's my favorite thing to do.

3925
03:46:51,140 --> 03:46:53,320
Wait, there's something up top here.

3926
03:46:57,000 --> 03:46:58,160
What is it?

3927
03:46:58,160 --> 03:46:59,360
What is it?

3928
03:46:59,760 --> 03:47:00,880
Oh, it's a box.

3929
03:47:01,020 --> 03:47:02,320
Jesus fucking Christ.

3930
03:47:02,620 --> 03:47:04,000
There's a diamond in here, too.

3931
03:47:05,640 --> 03:47:07,000
You wanna get the diamond?

3932
03:47:07,720 --> 03:47:09,060
Okay, yeah, I'll get the diamond.

3933
03:47:09,180 --> 03:47:09,900
Diamond's easier.

3934
03:47:14,700 --> 03:47:15,720
Let's get the box.

3935
03:47:15,740 --> 03:47:16,580
You wanna get the box?

3936
03:47:18,680 --> 03:47:19,960
The box is easier.

3937
03:47:21,260 --> 03:47:22,800
I think the box is easier.

3938
03:47:23,220 --> 03:47:23,860
Yeah, you're right.

3939
03:47:28,160 --> 03:47:28,500
There you go.

3940
03:47:31,360 --> 03:47:33,460
I mean, this was the only thing up there.

3941
03:47:33,500 --> 03:47:34,740
Yeah, it was, you're right.

3942
03:47:35,060 --> 03:47:36,940
That's the wrong way!

3943
03:47:37,000 --> 03:47:37,920
It is easier.

3944
03:47:38,720 --> 03:47:40,540
Look how easy this is.

3945
03:47:44,740 --> 03:47:45,980
Where's our fucking cart?

3946
03:47:47,260 --> 03:47:48,760
We can probably just bring it over.

3947
03:47:49,020 --> 03:47:49,180
That's true.

3948
03:47:49,920 --> 03:47:50,820
That's so true.

3949
03:47:55,280 --> 03:47:58,840
There's no way there's a server worth 20k that's about a big...

3950
03:47:58,840 --> 03:47:59,720
No way, right, Doki?

3951
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:03,200
There's a server worth 7,500 that's about to burst.

3952
03:48:05,300 --> 03:48:07,200
7,000 dollar server.

3953
03:48:07,360 --> 03:48:09,020
Yo, our box is kinda late.

3954
03:48:09,040 --> 03:48:11,100
Yeah, our box...

3955
03:48:11,100 --> 03:48:13,180
It's gonna bring us all the way...

3956
03:48:14,360 --> 03:48:15,460
Okay, okay.

3957
03:48:15,460 --> 03:48:16,440
Coney, stop!

3958
03:48:17,060 --> 03:48:19,500
Coney, stop!

3959
03:48:21,280 --> 03:48:22,460
Hold it still.

3960
03:48:24,200 --> 03:48:25,520
Okay, we have...

3961
03:48:25,520 --> 03:48:27,300
Okay, we...

3962
03:48:27,300 --> 03:48:29,980
No, no, we have 4k in our money bag.

3963
03:48:31,760 --> 03:48:32,780
You're right.

3964
03:48:33,440 --> 03:48:35,560
I am actually power crept by Coney.

3965
03:48:36,180 --> 03:48:37,160
Wait, what happened to our cart?

3966
03:48:37,340 --> 03:48:38,560
What happened to our cart?

3967
03:48:48,080 --> 03:48:51,260
There's a girl with scissor hands taking her way downtown.

3968
03:48:51,620 --> 03:48:52,680
Oh my god.

3969
03:48:53,840 --> 03:48:57,780
Well, I mean, if the scissor lady comes here and fucks it up, then we are fucked.

3970
03:48:58,680 --> 03:48:59,880
Oh my god, Coney, no!

3971
03:49:01,780 --> 03:49:03,760
The box is blocking the pathway.

3972
03:49:09,400 --> 03:49:12,380
It's like a

3973
03:49:16,050 --> 03:49:16,710
diving attempt.

3974
03:49:16,710 --> 03:49:16,810
Yeah.

3975
03:50:08,080 --> 03:50:10,500
He did not do it, guys.

3976
03:50:13,840 --> 03:50:16,560
What happened to the 21k?

3977
03:50:19,140 --> 03:50:20,360
What happened?

3978
03:50:26,200 --> 03:50:28,180
What happened to it?

3979
03:50:33,690 --> 03:50:34,870
So what happened?

3980
03:50:34,950 --> 03:50:35,650
Oh, you're alive.

3981
03:50:35,970 --> 03:50:37,950
Yeah, so what happened to the 21k?

3982
03:50:40,210 --> 03:50:41,690
We thought you died.

3983
03:50:41,790 --> 03:50:42,910
Oh, okay.

3984
03:50:43,230 --> 03:50:44,310
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

3985
03:50:44,350 --> 03:50:44,710
I'm leaving.

3986
03:50:45,210 --> 03:50:46,590
Scissor lady died and we're good.

3987
03:50:47,010 --> 03:50:47,650
I'll let them know.

3988
03:51:33,790 --> 03:51:34,710
Scissor lady's here.

3989
03:51:34,850 --> 03:51:35,350
There's two!

3990
03:51:38,590 --> 03:51:41,430
They're going the way we need to go.

3991
03:51:53,950 --> 03:51:54,510
Be gone.

3992
03:52:05,070 --> 03:52:05,990
Can you fucking crouch?

3993
03:52:06,610 --> 03:52:08,010
Don't make any noise.

3994
03:52:08,030 --> 03:52:09,810
Can you fucking crouch, please?

3995
03:52:09,810 --> 03:52:09,930
Please.

3996
03:52:14,690 --> 03:52:17,870
I will smash it.

3997
03:52:21,650 --> 03:52:23,170
Don't look at me.

3998
03:52:32,450 --> 03:52:34,330
Yes, there's B!

3999
03:52:34,710 --> 03:52:36,590
As fuck, yes!

4000
03:52:36,830 --> 03:52:37,970
You got caught.

4001
03:52:38,350 --> 03:52:40,350
Don't call me Liz!

4002
03:52:40,750 --> 03:52:43,610
I can't fucking see Liz.

4003
03:52:43,610 --> 03:52:45,310
I can't crouch.

4004
03:52:48,090 --> 03:52:50,650
I just see you get lit up.

4005
03:52:51,110 --> 03:52:53,770
Where did you die from, bro?

4006
03:52:54,050 --> 03:52:55,550
Dude, I don't fucking know.

4007
03:52:55,970 --> 03:52:56,930
I don't know.

4008
03:52:57,890 --> 03:52:58,210
I'll give it.

4009
03:52:58,730 --> 03:53:00,930
It was in the room with the vents.

4010
03:53:01,090 --> 03:53:02,330
In the swimming pool.

4011
03:53:02,790 --> 03:53:05,610
Cody used me as a fucking bait!

4012
03:53:09,360 --> 03:53:10,110
Cody, just go!

4013
03:53:16,630 --> 03:53:19,370
Cody's looking for him, but they're not close.

4014
03:53:19,670 --> 03:53:22,110
They are not close at all.

4015
03:53:24,050 --> 03:53:25,510
What the fuck is...

4016
03:53:27,930 --> 03:53:28,530
Wait.

4017
03:53:31,350 --> 03:53:32,830
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

4018
03:53:35,970 --> 03:53:37,510
Oh, he got your head.

4019
03:53:37,770 --> 03:53:40,930
Oh my god, my head is received.

4020
03:53:42,670 --> 03:53:44,790
Oh my god, we're coming back!

4021
03:53:44,790 --> 03:53:46,330
I'm coming back.

4022
03:53:47,230 --> 03:53:48,570
I'm back.

4023
03:53:48,670 --> 03:53:49,750
I'm back.

4024
03:53:50,070 --> 03:53:52,410
You fucking used me as bait, Cody!

4025
03:53:52,550 --> 03:53:53,670
I saw you!

4026
03:53:54,430 --> 03:53:56,950
You fucking used me as bait!

4027
03:53:57,350 --> 03:53:58,550
I saw you!

4028
03:54:01,910 --> 03:54:04,730
Let's go team, bro.

4029
03:54:06,570 --> 03:54:08,670
How are we still going?

4030
03:54:15,150 --> 03:54:17,210
How are we still going?

4031
03:54:17,210 --> 03:54:17,650
How are we still doing this?

4032
03:54:19,130 --> 03:54:20,190
I am getting summoned.

4033
03:54:20,590 --> 03:54:21,730
I may have to go.

4034
03:54:22,210 --> 03:54:25,430
What are you getting summoned for, Void?

4035
03:54:25,530 --> 03:54:27,690
How could you leave, Void?

4036
03:54:27,790 --> 03:54:28,650
I'm getting a buff.

4037
03:54:29,950 --> 03:54:31,490
What's more important than us?

4038
03:54:31,530 --> 03:54:33,090
What's more important than us, Void?

4039
03:54:33,930 --> 03:54:34,930
Tell us right now.

4040
03:54:38,370 --> 03:54:39,610
What's more important?

4041
03:54:40,810 --> 03:54:41,950
What's more important?

4042
03:54:42,530 --> 03:54:43,190
Tell us, Void.

4043
03:54:47,610 --> 03:54:50,170
You have another run?

4044
03:54:50,250 --> 03:54:51,930
You're gonna cheat on us?

4045
03:54:55,530 --> 03:54:59,310
Wow, you're gonna cheat on us like that.

4046
03:54:59,310 --> 03:55:03,470
That means we gotta hurry up and get to the next one.

4047
03:55:03,470 --> 03:55:04,890
Alright, let's do it.

4048
03:55:04,950 --> 03:55:06,850
Void, no, no, no.

4049
03:55:06,870 --> 03:55:08,510
You're doing this last one, Void.

4050
03:55:08,590 --> 03:55:09,090
One more.

4051
03:55:09,230 --> 03:55:09,910
Last one, last one.

4052
03:55:11,190 --> 03:55:12,030
Last one.

4053
03:55:13,710 --> 03:55:14,850
Last one, Void.

4054
03:55:15,010 --> 03:55:16,090
Get over here.

4055
03:55:16,790 --> 03:55:19,390
I don't have the willpower.

4056
03:55:20,110 --> 03:55:21,370
Void, how could you say that?

4057
03:55:21,370 --> 03:55:22,490
Just AFK, just AFK.

4058
03:55:23,030 --> 03:55:24,310
Void, don't do AFK.

4059
03:55:24,390 --> 03:55:25,530
We have to do something.

4060
03:55:25,530 --> 03:55:29,230
He's saying he doesn't have the willpower to stay.

4061
03:55:29,290 --> 03:55:29,930
No, let's go.

4062
03:55:30,850 --> 03:55:31,730
I believe.

4063
03:55:32,830 --> 03:55:33,510
I believe.

4064
03:55:34,450 --> 03:55:35,450
I need some help, y'all.

4065
03:55:35,690 --> 03:55:37,230
But I'm gonna go fast.

4066
03:55:37,410 --> 03:55:37,950
No, you don't.

4067
03:55:38,590 --> 03:55:40,170
I can't believe it.

4068
03:55:40,210 --> 03:55:40,950
You cheated.

4069
03:55:42,310 --> 03:55:45,830
I didn't think we'd have a four hour long run.

4070
03:55:45,830 --> 03:55:46,890
I can't believe it.

4071
03:55:47,090 --> 03:55:48,150
I don't think any of us fucking did.

4072
03:55:48,410 --> 03:55:50,270
You didn't think we would make it this far.

4073
03:55:50,330 --> 03:55:51,550
How could you say that?

4074
03:55:52,870 --> 03:55:55,510
And you're gonna leave the run like that?

4075
03:55:55,510 --> 03:55:56,990
You're gonna leave us?

4076
03:55:57,170 --> 03:55:58,570
I just think we're too good at video games.

4077
03:55:58,970 --> 03:56:01,490
I can't believe you would leave us like that.

4078
03:56:04,490 --> 03:56:08,610
Your other run's not gonna get as far as us, Void.

4079
03:56:08,630 --> 03:56:09,390
And you know it.

4080
03:56:10,090 --> 03:56:12,490
But it's already at level 17.

4081
03:56:12,930 --> 03:56:14,890
You're gonna feel so embarrassed when you die.

4082
03:56:14,890 --> 03:56:17,090
Yeah, but you weren't even part of that run, though.

4083
03:56:17,150 --> 03:56:18,470
You weren't actually part of it.

4084
03:56:18,590 --> 03:56:18,830
No, I was.

4085
03:56:19,050 --> 03:56:19,970
No, you weren't.

4086
03:56:20,830 --> 03:56:21,330
I was.

4087
03:56:22,110 --> 03:56:22,910
I was.

4088
03:56:23,370 --> 03:56:25,070
It's not a real run if they just stopped.

4089
03:56:25,390 --> 03:56:26,570
And kept going.

4090
03:56:26,890 --> 03:56:27,730
Look out!

4091
03:56:28,430 --> 03:56:29,450
Yeah, we stopped.

4092
03:56:29,650 --> 03:56:33,310
No, we've been doing it for a couple days.

4093
03:56:33,850 --> 03:56:34,510
Oh, but look at us.

4094
03:56:34,570 --> 03:56:37,070
We did it non-stop and we're at level 10.

4095
03:56:45,090 --> 03:56:46,090
Kony, we need you.

4096
03:56:46,210 --> 03:56:47,050
We need Big Boi.

4097
03:56:48,950 --> 03:56:51,950
I think I'm gonna go, guys.

4098
03:56:51,950 --> 03:56:52,950
We need Void!

4099
03:56:54,210 --> 03:56:55,550
I'm gonna go, guys.

4100
03:56:56,850 --> 03:56:57,570
No, Void!

4101
03:56:57,870 --> 03:56:58,250
Don't leave!

4102
03:57:01,270 --> 03:57:01,630
Oh,

4103
03:57:06,470 --> 03:57:06,610
wait.

4104
03:57:08,110 --> 03:57:08,610
He's dead.

4105
03:57:09,430 --> 03:57:10,910
Dude, why are there so many babies?

4106
03:57:13,610 --> 03:57:14,850
Just chuck them away!

4107
03:57:16,870 --> 03:57:17,590
There you go.

4108
03:57:18,630 --> 03:57:19,650
Oh my god, I got you.

4109
03:57:19,830 --> 03:57:20,830
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

4110
03:57:21,730 --> 03:57:22,450
Guys.

4111
03:57:23,430 --> 03:57:25,270
Maybe this is over.

4112
03:57:30,570 --> 03:57:32,290
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

4113
03:57:32,350 --> 03:57:33,210
He's alive.

4114
03:57:38,340 --> 03:57:40,720
I can't believe Void just left us like that.

4115
03:57:40,920 --> 03:57:45,760
I can't believe he picked a different run over us.

4116
03:57:46,920 --> 03:57:47,680
We're so special!

4117
03:57:49,160 --> 03:57:51,780
We made it to level 10!

4118
03:57:52,660 --> 03:57:53,460
First try!

4119
03:57:55,380 --> 03:57:57,620
We are a very special group of people.

4120
03:57:57,780 --> 03:57:58,480
How could he?

4121
03:58:00,100 --> 03:58:01,780
I'm walking backwards.

4122
03:58:03,440 --> 03:58:05,060
Oh, there it is.

4123
03:58:12,060 --> 03:58:14,620
Yeah, there's like a bunch of stuff.

4124
03:58:16,940 --> 03:58:17,940
Guys, I don't think...

4125
03:58:17,940 --> 03:58:19,420
Okay, we should push this cart back.

4126
03:58:20,160 --> 03:58:20,920
I'm pushing it back.

4127
03:58:23,000 --> 03:58:24,040
What the fuck?

4128
03:58:24,360 --> 03:58:25,520
How did I even do that?

4129
03:58:25,660 --> 03:58:26,960
Okay, leave this here for now.

4130
03:58:27,100 --> 03:58:27,920
We leave this here for now.

4131
03:58:27,960 --> 03:58:28,940
Let's just push the cart back.

4132
03:58:33,120 --> 03:58:34,880
Matt fell into the pit.

4133
03:58:36,800 --> 03:58:37,880
Wait, Matt what?

4134
03:58:38,060 --> 03:58:40,120
Matt fell into the pit.

4135
03:58:40,220 --> 03:58:41,540
Is he dead again?

4136
03:58:42,760 --> 03:58:44,140
There's no way.

4137
03:58:44,640 --> 03:58:45,520
There's no way.

4138
03:58:46,320 --> 03:58:48,360
No, we don't have room.

4139
03:58:48,360 --> 03:58:50,020
There's a big boy.

4140
03:58:50,480 --> 03:58:51,880
He's gonna destroy everything.

4141
03:58:57,230 --> 03:58:58,670
Kony's still over there.

4142
03:58:59,530 --> 03:58:59,890
What?

4143
03:59:00,670 --> 03:59:01,950
Oh my god.

4144
03:59:02,070 --> 03:59:03,110
That wasn't even me.

4145
03:59:03,690 --> 03:59:05,570
Behind you, Kony!

4146
03:59:08,890 --> 03:59:09,530
Okay.

4147
03:59:12,150 --> 03:59:13,870
This run is over.

4148
03:59:14,890 --> 03:59:15,750
This run is over.

4149
03:59:16,690 --> 03:59:17,690
Doki, no!

4150
03:59:19,290 --> 03:59:19,930
Doki!

4151
03:59:21,910 --> 03:59:23,170
I gave up.

4152
03:59:23,550 --> 03:59:26,210
The Roman Kony baited him into our cart.

4153
03:59:26,310 --> 03:59:27,010
I've given up.

4154
03:59:27,830 --> 03:59:29,410
No, what are you doing?

4155
03:59:30,070 --> 03:59:31,690
I gave up.

4156
03:59:32,010 --> 03:59:32,910
I gave up.

4157
03:59:33,410 --> 03:59:34,170
I said...

4158
03:59:34,170 --> 03:59:36,710
Wait, what?

4159
03:59:37,210 --> 03:59:37,850
Wow.

4160
03:59:40,550 --> 03:59:41,590
Great run.

4161
03:59:41,970 --> 03:59:42,650
Great run.

4162
03:59:42,690 --> 03:59:43,850
Yeah, I win, Boyd.

4163
03:59:43,850 --> 03:59:45,250
What do you mean?

4164
03:59:45,530 --> 03:59:46,850
GG's, Boyd.

4165
03:59:49,750 --> 03:59:51,030
GG's, Boyd.

4166
03:59:55,570 --> 03:59:56,370
GG's, Boyd.

4167
04:00:07,190 --> 04:00:08,850
Yes, he is.

4168
04:00:08,910 --> 04:00:10,830
He is Soapy Doof, guys.

4169
04:00:10,830 --> 04:00:12,030
He is.

4170
04:00:13,010 --> 04:00:13,730
Oh my god.

4171
04:00:14,610 --> 04:00:15,490
Oh my god.

4172
04:00:15,970 --> 04:00:19,150
I just got air dodged and fucking...

4173
04:00:20,390 --> 04:00:21,030
No!

4174
04:00:22,530 --> 04:00:24,530
Kony kills all Kony!

4175
04:00:24,750 --> 04:00:25,390
Challenger!

4176
04:00:26,050 --> 04:00:26,570
No!

4177
04:00:27,230 --> 04:00:31,310
We made him too strong!

4178
04:00:31,630 --> 04:00:33,290
We made him too strong!

4179
04:00:33,370 --> 04:00:34,390
We gotta put him down!

4180
04:00:34,570 --> 04:00:36,290
We gotta put him down!

4181
04:00:37,190 --> 04:00:39,070
We made him too strong!

4182
04:00:39,070 --> 04:00:40,790
We have to put him down!

4183
04:00:43,850 --> 04:00:45,850
Get him!

4184
04:00:52,210 --> 04:00:53,210
Yes!

4185
04:00:56,390 --> 04:00:57,370
We got him!

4186
04:00:58,990 --> 04:00:59,870
Let's go!

4187
04:01:01,390 --> 04:01:03,030
Wait, wait, wait.

4188
04:01:03,210 --> 04:01:05,130
After everything we've done.

4189
04:01:05,290 --> 04:01:06,030
Boyd!

4190
04:01:09,650 --> 04:01:11,130
Wait, what the fuck?

4191
04:01:11,330 --> 04:01:12,210
How did...

4192
04:01:16,450 --> 04:01:19,010
It's always been us two, hasn't it?

4193
04:01:19,390 --> 04:01:20,530
Oh my god, I'm killing him!

4194
04:01:22,210 --> 04:01:23,030
Oh shit!

4195
04:01:23,310 --> 04:01:24,730
That has to be Doki.

4196
04:01:24,910 --> 04:01:25,490
Oh shit!

4197
04:01:29,750 --> 04:01:30,310
Yippee!

4198
04:01:31,510 --> 04:01:33,190
It is always...

4199
04:01:33,190 --> 04:01:34,330
Doki Hot Armor.

4200
04:01:34,710 --> 04:01:36,970
I didn't know the stage got smaller.

4201
04:01:36,970 --> 04:01:40,890
How did you die, Boyd?

4202
04:01:40,970 --> 04:01:42,390
I don't even know!

4203
04:01:48,630 --> 04:01:52,030
I was not expecting a four hour run.

4204
04:01:52,750 --> 04:01:54,050
We went just easy!

4205
04:01:54,650 --> 04:01:56,770
Four hours?

4206
04:01:57,150 --> 04:01:58,610
It was more than that.

4207
04:01:58,870 --> 04:02:00,270
It was like five, almost.

4208
04:02:01,650 --> 04:02:03,150
Yeah, we lasted long.

4209
04:02:04,150 --> 04:02:05,730
I'm gonna go play more video games.

4210
04:02:05,730 --> 04:02:07,570
It was fun, guys.

4211
04:02:07,750 --> 04:02:08,970
Let me know if you guys play again.

4212
04:02:09,330 --> 04:02:10,390
We can play again later.

4213
04:02:10,510 --> 04:02:11,950
We are absolutely playing again.

4214
04:02:12,090 --> 04:02:14,690
Are we the best group you've ever had, Boyd?

4215
04:02:15,430 --> 04:02:17,010
This was really up there.

4216
04:02:17,910 --> 04:02:20,550
All of you guys played in the first one.

4217
04:02:21,110 --> 04:02:22,850
This is my second best run.

4218
04:02:25,350 --> 04:02:28,690
It could have been your first if someone didn't throw.

4219
04:02:30,170 --> 04:02:30,750
Cody!

4220
04:02:32,190 --> 04:02:34,650
No, Cody was too small.

4221
04:02:35,730 --> 04:02:37,050
Cody was stronger than you.

4222
04:02:37,630 --> 04:02:38,770
Bye, everybody!

4223
04:02:39,210 --> 04:02:40,370
Bye, everyone!

4224
04:02:45,250 --> 04:02:47,270
That was crazy.

4225
04:02:47,870 --> 04:02:49,290
I did not expect this.

4226
04:02:49,750 --> 04:02:51,510
This is actually not my first time playing Reaper.

4227
04:02:51,630 --> 04:02:53,750
I think this is my fourth time.

4228
04:02:54,430 --> 04:02:58,550
That was an insane fucking run today.

4229
04:02:58,550 --> 04:03:00,870
Oh, my God.

4230
04:03:01,430 --> 04:03:02,190
Okay.

4231
04:03:02,530 --> 04:03:04,810
But with Cody fucking...

4232
04:03:04,810 --> 04:03:05,090
Okay.

4233
04:03:06,850 --> 04:03:07,610
Like...

4234
04:03:08,530 --> 04:03:09,550
That shit!

4235
04:03:10,090 --> 04:03:11,050
Oh, my God.

4236
04:03:11,130 --> 04:03:11,910
I was wheezing.

4237
04:03:12,350 --> 04:03:15,030
I was trying so hard...

4238
04:03:15,030 --> 04:03:16,650
not to like...

4239
04:03:16,650 --> 04:03:17,890
not to laugh.

4240
04:03:18,190 --> 04:03:21,250
So I had to wheeze because I didn't want to laugh.

4241
04:03:21,570 --> 04:03:23,350
Because I didn't want to die.

4242
04:03:24,030 --> 04:03:26,270
That was so fucking funny.

4243
04:03:28,710 --> 04:03:30,270
Oh, my God.

4244
04:03:30,550 --> 04:03:31,350
And then...

4245
04:03:31,350 --> 04:03:33,770
No, he lived the first shot.

4246
04:03:33,970 --> 04:03:37,470
He lived the first shot, but then he did it again.

4247
04:03:37,790 --> 04:03:40,070
I don't know why he did it again.

4248
04:03:40,650 --> 04:03:42,110
Oh, my God.

4249
04:03:43,790 --> 04:03:45,190
Oh, my God.

4250
04:03:45,570 --> 04:03:47,170
He juked it.

4251
04:03:47,210 --> 04:03:48,730
I saw him juked it.

4252
04:03:49,950 --> 04:03:53,110
It had like the perfect POV of it, too.

4253
04:03:55,530 --> 04:03:57,530
Anyway, I had a great time.

4254
04:03:58,110 --> 04:03:59,810
Before I got to rest now...

4255
04:03:59,810 --> 04:04:01,750
Before I go...

4256
04:04:01,750 --> 04:04:03,030
Before I go...

4257
04:04:03,030 --> 04:04:04,450
I do have something to show.

4258
04:04:04,690 --> 04:04:06,730
And that is the...

4259
04:04:06,730 --> 04:04:08,690
That is the...

4260
04:04:08,690 --> 04:04:11,030
Good Smile plushie.

4261
04:04:11,070 --> 04:04:13,230
Because the pre-orders are ending today!

4262
04:04:13,990 --> 04:04:17,010
So, if you want to have a Doki Bird...

4263
04:04:17,010 --> 04:04:19,250
Marketable Doki Bird plushie...

4264
04:04:19,250 --> 04:04:22,630
Please check out the links that I just...

4265
04:04:22,630 --> 04:04:23,090
posted.

4266
04:04:23,090 --> 04:04:24,190
Posted in chat.

4267
04:04:24,290 --> 04:04:26,150
Let me get the plushie so it looks like...

4268
04:04:26,150 --> 04:04:27,990
Basically looks like this.

4269
04:04:28,270 --> 04:04:28,910
Oh, shit.

4270
04:04:28,970 --> 04:04:29,490
Let me...

4271
04:04:29,490 --> 04:04:30,810
It looks like this.

4272
04:04:30,970 --> 04:04:33,630
So, yes, pre-orders for it is ending today.

4273
04:04:33,850 --> 04:04:35,690
Last day of pre-order, guys.

4274
04:04:36,130 --> 04:04:38,570
The more pre-orders we get, the more opportunities we can get...

4275
04:04:38,570 --> 04:04:39,930
in the future with Good Smile.

4276
04:04:40,670 --> 04:04:42,410
So, yes, pre-order now!

4277
04:04:42,670 --> 04:04:43,630
Before I go.

4278
04:04:43,930 --> 04:04:45,050
Pre-order, pre-order.

4279
04:04:45,850 --> 04:04:47,210
It helps a lot.

4280
04:04:47,350 --> 04:04:49,650
In regards to supporting the stream...

4281
04:04:49,650 --> 04:04:50,990
And supporting this channel.

4282
04:04:51,410 --> 04:04:54,030
And supporting for more merch in the future.

4283
04:04:54,670 --> 04:04:55,110
But, yes!

4284
04:04:56,130 --> 04:04:56,590
What?

4285
04:04:56,710 --> 04:04:57,290
Oh my god.

4286
04:04:57,350 --> 04:04:59,650
I cannot expect this run to go...

4287
04:05:00,370 --> 04:05:02,850
4 hours.

4288
04:05:02,970 --> 04:05:05,210
That was fucking crazy.

4289
04:05:05,470 --> 04:05:06,070
I did not...

4290
04:05:06,070 --> 04:05:07,950
I thought we were going to...

4291
04:05:07,950 --> 04:05:11,150
Go to level 3 or something.

4292
04:05:11,530 --> 04:05:13,450
But the fact that we went to level 10...

4293
04:05:13,450 --> 04:05:14,610
Is absolutely insane.

4294
04:05:15,130 --> 04:05:16,130
But I had a lot of fun.

4295
04:05:16,130 --> 04:05:18,090
I always have a lot of fun playing with Team Brawl Pro.

4296
04:05:19,570 --> 04:05:20,010
Um...

4297
04:05:21,350 --> 04:05:22,930
Lots of really funny moments.

4298
04:05:23,310 --> 04:05:23,750
Um...

4299
04:05:23,750 --> 04:05:26,750
I feel like I aged like 50 years when I was left alone.

4300
04:05:27,030 --> 04:05:28,170
And I had to clutch it.

4301
04:05:28,210 --> 04:05:30,110
I literally did not talk for like...

4302
04:05:30,110 --> 04:05:32,090
I think like 10 to 15 minutes.

4303
04:05:32,270 --> 04:05:34,350
Because I knew the moment I say anything...

4304
04:05:34,350 --> 04:05:35,250
I fucking die.

4305
04:05:36,250 --> 04:05:37,130
I just...

4306
04:05:37,130 --> 04:05:40,610
I knew I was going to fucking die.

4307
04:05:40,610 --> 04:05:40,810
I...

4308
04:05:40,810 --> 04:05:41,790
I...

4309
04:05:41,790 --> 04:05:45,450
I said it.

4310
04:05:45,610 --> 04:05:48,110
My heart was beating during the...

4311
04:05:48,110 --> 04:05:50,150
My heart was beating so fast.

4312
04:05:50,590 --> 04:05:51,030
Um...

4313
04:05:51,030 --> 04:05:54,510
When I had to bring the fucking broom down the staircase.

4314
04:05:54,850 --> 04:05:55,550
Because I was like...

4315
04:05:55,550 --> 04:05:58,270
If I lose 2 more K.

4316
04:05:58,390 --> 04:06:01,530
I would not make enough money for it.

4317
04:06:02,150 --> 04:06:03,350
It was so scary.

4318
04:06:03,710 --> 04:06:04,050
But anyway.

4319
04:06:04,350 --> 04:06:05,310
I had a great time.

4320
04:06:05,390 --> 04:06:06,490
I'm going to call it here now.

4321
04:06:06,490 --> 04:06:11,450
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4322
04:06:11,610 --> 04:06:14,910
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

4323
04:06:15,050 --> 04:06:16,410
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4324
04:06:16,930 --> 04:06:17,830
Bye, guys.

4325
04:06:18,050 --> 04:06:18,470
Bye!
