a netflix recap it's the amazon prime slash netflix recap

25
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:43,180
that explains everything but also nothing at the same time
um say jen thank you for the super chat thank you thank you

26
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:52,260
um is it yeah my toes okay don't worry it's it's okay i
swear to god i i the one thing i hate about streaming

27
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,160
services now is that good tv Like, not even good TV.

28
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,100
But any TV show is now one hour long.

29
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,800
And it takes fucking two years to film in between seasons.

30
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,020
And I'm just like, bro, I don't...

31
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,280
I don't remember what happened.

32
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,040
It doesn't matter how good.

33
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,000
Like, I might as well just wait until the show finishes
before I watch anything.

34
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:34,980
because it like every time I watch a new season of like the
newest hit show like Severance I when the Severance season 2

35
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:41,840
came out and I was like what the fuck happened in season 1
but like I remember season 1 being really good but it was

36
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:48,040
also a fucking mind fuck so then when I when he showed the
recap I'm like I don't remember any of this I was like I

37
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,720
sort of vaguely remember but also like I don't remember.

38
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,000
And, Kat, thank you for the...

39
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,260

00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,780
Yeah, it's like...

42
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,340
It doesn't even have to be a hit show.

43
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,700
And the thing is, Breaking Bad was like...

44
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,020
Did not take that long to film in between seasons.

45
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,500
And what?

46
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,040
What was it?

47
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,660
Breaking Bad...

48
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,160
Episode length.

49
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,100
Was it one hour or 30 minutes?

50
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,060
It was one hour.

51
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,420
Okay, it was one hour.

52
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,700

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,180

Let me...

81
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,380
I disappeared.

82
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,180
This is even more immersive.

83
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,240
And then...

84
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,120
There we go.

85
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:41,820
There we go.

86
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,860
Now, am I close enough, guys?

87
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,540
Or do I further?

88
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,480
Whoa, whoa.

90
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,380
Whoa, whoa.

91
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,700
Whoa.

92
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
Oh, even closer.

93
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,260
Whoa.

94
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,560
All right, that's close enough.

95
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,100
That's as close.

96
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,020
Or, or I'll be like, whoa.

97
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,320
I think you can see my little, my little sleeve there.

98
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,320
All right, here you go.

99
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,120
You can see a little dragon down there, too.

100
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,740
All right, let me lock it in.

101
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,460
Sorry, today's a pretty chill, because I feel very chilling
right now.

102
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,380
It's, it is.

103
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,740
very early for me and by early I mean it is 12 30 p.m.

104
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:39,880
and that is too early for me so I might sound monotone
because I inside I'm dead inside understandable right now

105
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:52,420
I'm dead inside there's no soul in this body uh we're a
youtube inch anyway but like i said i this is what i hate

106
00:14:52,420 --> 00:15:04,540
about modern tv shows now because um because everything
takes two to three years uh two to three years to to produce

107
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:12,700
and then like and then and then i just forget everything and
I swear to God like and then like the actors just grow up

108
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,760
way too fucking fast because you're like You can't even get
child actors anymore because like like by the time it's

109
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:29,120
season two They'll be like 25 years old at they start the
show at like 13 and then see by season two comes out They're

110
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:37,040
like 25 and they have to still play like a 15 year old or
something I like it was like what was it um anyone who ever

111
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:45,760
watched oh, yeah like avatar the Netflix adaptation it's so
fucking funny because I was like Tanya's hell and then like

112
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:54,520
season two come the season two previews came out and then
he's like taller than like all the actors now because you

113
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,580
don't expect it you know because they haven't gone through
puberty so you're just hoping that um you're just hoping

114
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:08,720
that the kids will the the Tanya kids would like their
puberty will have like a growth stunt or some shit like they

115
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:20,920
just don't hit it and now ang is like taller than saka now
yeah and then it's like it was like the adams family too um

116
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:30,460
if you ever watched wednesday i haven't watched season two
because like um because like in season one um apparently

117
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,920
like they got rid of all the plot points that came from
season one um because one of the actors turned out to be

118
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:46,740
like I don't know like really bad one of the actors was very
important to the whole overarching story of Wednesday and

119
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:55,800
was supposed to continue in season two the actor got fired
so so so they have to scrap the entire storyline and then

120
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:04,020
come up with a new storyline for season two so I don't
remember what the fuck he did but I I don't keep up to date

121
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:13,320
with that stuff I just know he did a apparently um i don't
know bad enough that he got fired it's like the avengers

122
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:23,000
where um um we're like what's his name the whole story that
was based off of that tang right there there was the whole

123
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,580
overarching story was supposed to based off tang of the
multiverse stuff and everything and then he got fired so

124
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:39,440
then they had to rewrite the entire avengers plot line
because like after follow up uh Thanos because there he was

125
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:48,060
the next big bad and then and then and then he got fired
because he did a really bad thing and so they're like what

126
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:58,920
the fuck do we do and then that's why there was a whole gap
in between like throwing random shit um on the board to be

127
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,920
like what do we replace gang with and that that's why we
have yeah but then apparently we're supposed to get like we

128
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:12,960
were supposed to get the the new avengers movie a lot
earlier because it was based around king and that the scrap

129
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,080
the entire like because like they write like 20 years in
advance or some shit but at least we got dr doom but the

130
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:28,820
funniest shit is that dr doom has no room apparently they're
like um apparently the leaks were saying that mr Fantastic

131
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,340
does not have a big role in the film regarding a film about
Dr. Doom.

132
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,540
I was just like, but they're rivals, though.

133
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,740
Yeah, I was just like, how...

134
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,140
What?

135
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,960
Yeah, it makes no...

136
00:18:50,960 --> 00:19:01,140
I hope that's just bait, but like, like, the directors were
saying, like, um, yeah, it, um, Fantastic Four will not have

137
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:12,820
like a huge role in the new doctor the new Avengers movie
and I'm like but there that but his doctor to do became

138
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:25,580
doctor doom because of the fantastic four and like they're
like lifelong rivals it doesn't make sense and then and then

139
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:35,460
another leak um is that saying that like oh doctor i hope
it's all bait because none of this is making sense the more

140
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:45,900
we learn about the new avengers movie the less sense it's
making for me but anyway they were saying like oh um doctor

141
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:52,400
do like because he's being played by robert downy jr who is
also like you know tony stark they were like oh yeah he

142
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:00,100
there's no relations between like tony stark and dr doom And
I'm like, then what's the point?

143
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,760
Why does he look like Robert Downey?

144
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,660
Why does he look like Tony Stark?

145
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,600
Then what?

146
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,880
He just loves Tony Stark.

147
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,280
He fucking got plastic surgery and was like, make me look
like him.

148
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:23,440
I hope, yeah, I hope that is, um, I hope that was also bait
because I just, like, why would you, like, I hope it has

149
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,200
like some, it's like an alternate universe.

150
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:37,560
there is a one plot line where um dr doom and robert downy
jr like swap bodies or some like an alternate universe where

151
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:46,360
dr doom and robert downy jr swap bodies and then he like um
he basically was like you know he was tony stark uh sorry

152
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:54,140
like i said robert downy jr but he practically is tony stark
right now um like that's like his entire role um but like no

153
00:20:54,140 --> 00:21:02,340
with the um with the tony and like and that was an actual
plot line in the comics i hope it's like something like that

154
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:11,460
where um where it's uh where he just took over tony stark's
body in a different universe and just wants to conquer the

155
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:19,360
multiverse or some shit also i read i know this is like so

He has an Iron Man cake too.

184
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,040
Is it this?

185
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,960
He literally had an Iron Man cake.

186
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,370
Like that's me.

187
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,430
I don't even know how old.

188
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,390
Bro he's 60.

189
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,130
Holy shit.

190
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:39,930
60 now he looks really good for 60 gotta be all the botox
i'm sorry i'm sorry bro you cannot be like no it's all

191
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:50,450
natural no this it's no like look at anne halfway that
there's no way that's natural like anne hathaway is 43 and

192
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,450
they're like wow she looks so good for it bro it's botox
there's no fucking way.

193
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:02,890
I refuse to believe that her skin is that tight at 40 years
old.

194
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,650
There is no way.

195
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,450
When you have the money, you don't have to worry about
aging.

196
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,710
Like, what's her name?

197
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:26,570
Um, no, I don't believe celebrities can take care of
themselves, um, to look that good because celebrities they

198
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:34,710
have to go through extreme weight loss and extreme weight
gain for film roles and also filming like um they might have

199
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:44,190
to like film for like launch like x amount of hours too and
then press tours and the stress of like the stress of

200
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:52,150
publicity and everything and um and you know because like
streaming as well like you know the stress of numbers and

201
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,630
stuff like

202
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:06,350
like press tours and having your entire life be monitored by
paparazzi's and doing you can't if you say one wrong thing

203
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:19,050
like they'll demonize you and everything there's no way
there is no way and also I if you guys don't remember he was

204
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:27,950
a drug addict for for like 10 plus years His not even 20
plus years of his life.

205
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,970
So there's no way he fixed that like

206
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,770
There's no way like his like at 60 his body was like it's
all right.

207
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,500
We're better now

208
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,470
It's possible.

209
00:26:48,950 --> 00:27:00,850
Yeah, I know some people forgot some people Forget that Wow,
it works, yeah, that he was a big drug addict for, like, 15

210
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,170
to 20 years of his life, but then he got better.

211
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,450
But his body was so fucked up by then.

212
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,050
Patra as soon, thank you for the super chat.

213
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,190
Thank you, thank you.

214
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,370
That was the character training arc for Tony Stark.

215
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,430
Hi, Ed.

216
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,110
Um, yeah, oh, yeah, it's so weird when they lie about it.

217
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,930
Yeah, same with, like, what's her name?

218
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,210
It's so weird.

219
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:41,330
There's so many actresses and actors that lied about getting
plastic surgery or Botox because their entire fucking face

220
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,090
changes.

221
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,950
Um, what was her name?

222
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:49,010
The actress and the boys and then Sadie, was there any
other, the Stranger Things girl?

223
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,890
What's her name, Sadie?

224
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:57,670
Like, you could tell, like, they got plastic surgery
because, like, Because, like, they can't do emotions

225
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,330
anymore.

226
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:06,950
They got plastic surgery and Botox because, like, they can't
emote anymore.

227
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,430
Like, they're like, now be sad.

228
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,030
And they're like,

229
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,540
you're like, are you sad?

230
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,760
You're like, I am sad.

231
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,940
And you're just like,

232
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,390
yeah.

233
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,010
Yeah, because they can't move their face because the Botox
makes it really hard.

234
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:42,170
to make your face go up and down um it's a closed mouth
you're sad and sad and then the what's her name the girl who

235
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:48,690
does like starlight in the boys she was like i didn't get
plastic surgery okay um it's just lighting and i'm like bro

236
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:57,810
you're bro you're what happened to the cheek fat in your
fucking jaw like she's like always weight loss and like it's

237
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:09,230
like what your nose like bro what I did not realize weight
loss puts like removes an entire bone on her your nose like

238
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:21,630

nose what do you mean weight loss

239
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:36,610
um yeah no she looks so different I'm really sad that
because like she was so I think she looked really cute

240
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:44,370
before she got plastic surgery slash um the cheek whatever
like there was a new for those who don't know there's a new

241
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:52,550
Hollywood fad right now uh for actresses and actors where
they literally removed the fat from their cheeks because

242
00:29:52,550 --> 00:30:01,350
they don't later like because they want to look more I guess
serious or more Like I guess like Greek statuesque type type

243
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:09,390
style, but like I think I don't know I was like you looked
so cute before I thought you looked like A lot of people

244
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:19,650
looked really good with the fat like in their cheeks Like is
that but like yeah that was it called the the boot gal fat

245
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,110
removal So yeah people like the muing suit.

246
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:28,750
Yeah like the muing shit You think gave you all these bones
being Thank you for the super chat.

247
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,150
Thank you.

248
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,790
Thank you.

249
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,530
And I think people look better with the fat.

250
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,050
I don't think the... I don't know.

251
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,390
I think the sunken cheek look is not attractive at all.

252
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,150
It's just... I don't...

253
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,450
My personal opinion, it is not attractive at all.

254
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,130
I think it makes them...

255
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,490
The fat removal makes them look a little bit more ugly.

256
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,550
I think they looked a lot better with it.

257
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:05,370
And also, like, it's so weird when it jumps between seasons
and then, and then, like, they just don't look like the

258
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,170
person before.

259
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,050
And I'm like, what happened to her?

260
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,310
And not to look them.

261
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,390
Because, like, that's what happened to me for Starlight and
the boys for the new season.

262
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,430
When the new season came out and I saw her, I was like, who
the, what the fuck happened to her?

263
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,510
Who, like, I was like, did someone starve her?

264
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,110
Like, girl, are you not getting paid?

265
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,390
Like, oh my god, are you not making enough money in the
boys?

266
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,710
Like, who's feeding her?

267
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,970
And then I Googled and they're like, oh, she got plastic
surgery.

268
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:47,770
I was just like, oh, she got, oh, she got plastic surgery.

269
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,050
She got that shit removed.

270
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,170
That's what happened.

271
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,670
Like, someone, please give her a sandwich.

272
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,390

Yahoo for the articles and be like oh what's new on

345

celebrity news right now and then you know those TMZ
interviews where they're all in the TMZ room and they're

346
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:47,910
like oh my god did you guys hear about I didn't watch Jersey
Shore though that was too trash even for me that was

347
00:36:47,910 --> 00:37:00,550
actually too trash even for me I had I had a limit I had a
limit to the trash I consume I also unfortunately did not

348
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:09,390
keep up with the Kardashians um oh I watched wife swap only
because my mom watched wife my mom was trashy in terms of

349
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:18,630
like she she consumed a trash reality TV shows so I consumed
trash reality TV shows with her so she would watch like wife

350
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:29,630
swap and like she watched like um like those home home like
uh Those like home redecoration chat shows.

351
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,670
And like she was the one that introduced me to Desperate
Housewives.

352
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,150
And I was way too young to be watching Desperate Housewives.

353
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,230
But I...

354
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,550
A generational garbage watch it.

355
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,610
Yeah she continued.

356
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,190
I continued the cycle.

357
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,150
I was too young to be watching Desperate Housewives.

358
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,730
But like I watched it with her.

359
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,870
I think she watched sex in the city.

360
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,410
I don't know.

361
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,830
I thought sex in the city was like I never watched sex in
the city.

362
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:04,890
That was my limit.

363
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,950
I thought it was I think I watched one episode with her on
TV and then and then I was like this is boring.

364
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,530
I thought it'd be like more sexy.

365
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,670
But then it was just women getting brunch.

366
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,510
It was just women getting brunch.

367
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:28,310
I was like bro what the It's like turn back desperate
housewives.

368
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:35,790
I want to know who's cheating on who next I'm not like true.

369
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:41,410
Yeah, it's just that's what sex in the city is and they're
just they're just going for brunch.

370
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,010
Anyway, let me show you the transformation.

371
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,350
It's actually insane.

372
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:57,650
Like I'm like I like like when I saw this I was like at that
point I'm like bro that's just like magic like what happened

373
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:06,470
to her fucking there's no wrinkles no more this is it's a
magic burned up surgeon

374
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:27,630
that surgeon's a fucking witch like like she literally aged
backwards

375
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:39,430
yeah because it's like really hit or miss plastic surgery
Because, like, I mean, I already told you, like, examples of

376
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,550
it.

377
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,390
So, I'm, like, like, bro, do you know how old she is?

378
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:49,320
She's, like, okay, how old?

379
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,780
She's, like, 80 or some shit, right?

380
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,660
She's 70.

381
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,380
This is, bro, she's fucking 70.

382
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,420
That's insane.

383
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, I was, like, 80.

384
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,940
They're, like, it's all at the same age for me.

385
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,480
Yeah.

386
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah, that's 70.

387
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:17,700
saying that's why i was like what what else does he do i
need to see his portfolio because this shit is magic the hag

388
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,880
is that yes

389
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:37,260
that's why i'm like that's crazy anyway what was i talking
about before i got before um or was i just talking about oh

390
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:46,180
yeah the trashy shows i used to watch um and even then i
consumed trash from twitter too so I like how Twitter has

391
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,160
been renamed X for X amount of years.

392
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,320
And we still call, we still call Twitter Twitter.

393
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,140
It just sounds better.

394
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,180
Bro, Elon Musk has been trying to fucking make X work for
the longest fucking time.

395
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,340
For those who don't know, he tried to make PayPal X.com as
well.

396
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,240
But then the board of directors was like, no.

397
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:16,740
He actually got voted down because even the board of
directors at PayPal was like, that's fucking stupid, Mr.

398
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,240
Musk.

399
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,900
Like, we are not renaming PayPal.

400
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:26,600
And then he bought Twitter and it's like, finally, I can
make my dreams come true.

401
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:35,210
We can finally make my dreams come true and call it X.

402
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,170
Alright, anyway.

403
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,910
Let's actually start the stream.

404
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,330
Our 42 minutes intermission.

405
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:52,330
So, I really want to get back into making creative streams
again um so uh i would love to have your input and your

406
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:57,610
ideas on what streams you guys want to see um it's not more
like more like oh i want to see you play x game i want to

407
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:04,030
see you play this game or like i want to see you collab with
this person or that person it's more so like creative ideas

408
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:10,150
like i wrote some stuff down i've been like brainstorming
myself too for 2026 and i want to go back into more creative

409
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:19,230
fun ideas um and so just playing video games um so here's
some examples um i wrote down um for like ideas and stuff

410
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:30,650
wait let me see where did i wrote my examples give me a sec
i i did write examples but i need to scroll up and find

411
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,470
where i write it uh wait is it not here is it in games

412
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:49,070
oh okay so so examples will be like uh you know i've been
watching doug doug again recently um um just because i was

413
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:54,470
like trying to think of stream ideas and so some of these
things so you know how so uh i'm thinking of hiring a

414
00:42:54,470 --> 00:43:01,450
programmer to let us think of make like cool stream like
cool chat interactive games together so one of the things i

415
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:15,790
want to do is like a battle royale So, basically, what Doug
Doug did is he set up a code where it will pick random

416
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,790
chatters in chat and then put them through tests.

417
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:23,450
And then chat will vote off who to kill based off of their
answers.

418
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:30,750
So, like, we can give them, like, answers, be like, oh, give
it, like, oh, tell us your favorite game.

419
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,770
And then, like, the random people we picked will be like,
oh, this is my, and then be like, convince the chat and then

420
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:42,910
and then they give their favorite game and I'll be like chat
kill off one person that you think has the shittiest taste

421
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:57,030
and and then and then basically something like that like
yeah the chat hunger games yeah why is it always about I

422
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:05,810
just gave one example and then another thing that he did I
talked about it before but he was like okay To the

423
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,750
contestants, pick one random person to die.

424
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,430
And then they're like, everyone talks.

425
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,230
And the people, the, the chatters talk to each other.

426
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,170
And they're like, okay, we picked this person to die.

427
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:23,550
And then, and then Doug Doug was like, JK, now the person
you pick now has a knife.

428
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,790
Now you, your entire, the entire chat picked you to die.

429
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,310
You pick one person to kill.

430
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,050
So it's like absolute anarchy.

431
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:45,550
that's really fun um you know i like that tango thank you
for the super chat thank you we are not we are we are not

432
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:53,450
drawing beatros thank you for the super chat thank you thank
you so these are like you know these are some ideas um like

433
00:44:53,450 --> 00:45:02,210
an example of what kind of streams that we could do in the
future another example i wrote is that watching animal cams

434
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:09,370
like live cams um because that's not playing game where well
you know you know how zoos have like animal live cams and

435
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,290
also twitch too

436
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:22,750
um and like you know we could watch zoo cams and stuff or
like like those what live cams do they have anyway there's

437
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:28,730
like not just animal cams but there's like a bunch of
there's live cams around the world of different things and

438
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,070
we could like people watch too that's not creepy

439
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:46,230
oh my god okay yeah there's like earth live cams in united
states oh we can look at oh my god there's a live cam right

440
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:52,390
now philadelphia pennsylvania we could literally people
watch yeah

441
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:03,340
it's not yeah we could actually people watch them and judge
them the world.

442
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,060
Oh, let's go to Italy.

443
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,600
What's all going on in Italy right now?

444
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,180

445
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,400
I'm going to Italy, guys.

446
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,180
Uh, Brandino, welcome to Tomato Farm.

447
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,000
Totally not creepy at all.

448
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,980
These are like some ideas.

449
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,260
What else is that right?

450
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,480

451
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:45,100
uh voice command mario maker um what else oh i love the okay
i was watching one of my the one i really like but then i

452
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:53,960
think it'll um i think it'll be like uh really hard to
program because he programmed it himself it's like i must do

453
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:01,040
anything the richest chatter says and it's so fucking funny
because it was just they're like and they're like honest

454
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:09,720
download this game and then played this game and then like
by the time he finishes downloading some other guy like some

455
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:19,500
other guy donates and becomes the richest chatter he's like
i just saw that game play my game it was it was really i'll

456
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:25,840
show you i'll link the video it's actually really fucking
funny because he was just like please i just want to play

457
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:37,620
like one game just let me play And then like some guy was
like ban the last richest chatter And then ban the last

458
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:45,480
Because apparently if you ban someone They can't even They
can't donate again So then he one of them was like Ban the

459
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:58,340
last two richest chatters And and uninstall steam So no one
can play any game And it was like it was crazy It was such a

460
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,440
good video And then in the end, all the money went to
charity.

461
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,270
So, you know, it was not like, you know.

462
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,120

00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,340
When the Dougberg crossover stream happening.

469
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,560
Dougberg retired, guys.

470
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,600
I don't know if you know.

471
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,760
A lot of really big streamers.

472
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,260
Retired recently.

473
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:30,920
I mean to be fair.

474
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:37,800
He's been doing this for a while and it's like he's he's
Doug Doug is like super fucking great Yeah, in his newest

475
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,320
video.

476
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:45,720
He posted a retirement video But it's more so like he just
wants to do whatever like he just he just wants to he's

477
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:53,580
going the PewDiePie route This is how I found find out on a
don't keep her stream where she's talking about celebrity

478
00:48:53,580 --> 00:49:13,660
trash and then I find out how you find out um so um yeah so
he's he's going um he's going to PewDiePie route and

479
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:20,700
basically just doing whatever he not chasing numbers anymore
because like he's made it basically he has enough money to

480
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:32,340
basically just make fun content that content that he wants
to make no he's He's not that route, but just, he has made

481
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:37,020
enough that he just wants to do what he wants to do for the
rest of his life.

482
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,760
Because I assume, like, you know, he makes enough.

483
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:45,700
He makes enough invest in other stuff, like go into
investment and what's the other thing?

484
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,640
What else?

485
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,420
Is it just investments?

486
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,940
Or there's a word for it.

487
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,000
You know, when...

488
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:57,920
Um...

489
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,200
Is it investment?

490
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,560
Where he has, like, other means of income.

491
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,560
Day tree.

492
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,340
Yeah, passive income.

493
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,080
He just makes it up and then just diversify and has passive
income.

494
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,980
To the point where he doesn't have to, like, stream to make
money anymore.

495
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,040
Yeah.

496
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,400
Because, like, that's what people should do when you make
enough.

497
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:29,160
By the way, adult advice, I know you're...

498
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,400
You're like, adult life advice from Doki Bread.

499
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:31,820
I don't know.

500
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,380
I should take life advice from you.

501
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:43,820
But if you make enough money, like the smartest thing to do
of your income, if you're not living paycheck by paycheck,

502
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,160
is to look at passive income.

503
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:55,260
So that, like, you know, you like, so that you build up your
passive income and look into investments and stock market

504
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,380
and stuff like that.

505
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,200
Or, like, you know, housing market.

506
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,540
um just to make sure you have passive income in the future
when you're older so when by the time you retire um you

507
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:13,420
don't have to worry about like oh i can't retire yet because
uh because i need i don't have enough money uh when i'm like

508
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:21,020
40 years old or 50 years old uh 50 plus years old so i have
to keep working i think that's also a problem i know like um

509
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:30,160
i know like there's like a problem right now where a lot of
like the like a lot like like the elderly um are still

510
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:38,360
working because they don't have the funds to retire uh so
because they're like oh i can't retire yet like i can't take

511
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:46,640
care of myself if i retire now so they just keep working and
working and working until like until you know they just work

512
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:53,080
themselves to death but yeah it's actually really smart to
just um by the time you have enough money to start investing

513
00:51:53,080 --> 00:52:02,820
in other things you have passive income um anyway little
life advice because like you know how like football stars or

514
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:09,300
like i feel like streamers a lot of streamers invest too a
lot of like the really big streamers like i think i'm pretty

515
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:18,600
sure dug dug has passive income like that guy is fucking
smart as hell um but like a lot of like sports like people

516
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:26,420
were in sports um they don't look into passive income and
that's why like football stars they would make millions of

517
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:35,580
dollars per year but but that by the time but then they
would go bankrupt uh they go bankrupt like uh within like a

518
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:40,360
few years because they don't have passive income they just
keep spending money they keep spending spending spending

519
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:49,740
yeah anyway to my manager um don't judge me because i i i
know

520
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:59,420
And I was like, oh, why don't you, yeah, you, why don't you
take your own advice, huh?

521
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,080
Imagine side-eyeing me right now, just like, you know what
to do, yet you don't do it.

522
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,020
Don't do what I do, do as I say, not as I do.

523
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,050
Imagine, like, oh, so you do know how to be smart with your
money.

524
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,090
You just choose not to.

525
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:31,010
I say as I spend a thousand dollars becoming the duchess of
sea land.

526
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:39,530
I guide others to treasure I cannot possess.

527
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:45,370
But we can be happy now.

528
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,030
Exactly.

529
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,630

programmer on discord and to talk more about stuff I think

538
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:46,970
the hardest part is that YouTube chat is not like as
customizable as Twitch so like that's like one of the

539
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:56,850
hardest things about seeing what I can do if worse comes to
worse um I can just have I can just use just have to have

the interactive part but we can still be on youtube um we

541
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:10,670

555
00:56:59,210 --> 00:56:59,770
Think of the super chat.

556
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,090
Thank you.

557
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,690
I mean, that's cute.

558
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,130
That's a cute idea.

559
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:10,610
That'd be a cute thing to do for like a week or so, but it's
not really a stream idea.

560
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,350
It's more so of like just a starting screen thing.

561
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,090
But it is a cute idea.

562
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:16,010
I think of the super chat.

563
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:16,570
Thank you.

564
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,870
Maybe I'll do something not in the future.

565
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,250
I didn't.

566
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,290
Thank you for the super chat.

567
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:20,610
Thank you.

568
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:21,210
Thank you.

569
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:32,090
Send for all the saskatchas i don't okay this is my hot take
i'll do a hot take right now um but i don't think like i

570
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:50,090
think eye tracker cams is like it's annoying because like we
all know what i'm looking at So it's like, I don't, I don't

571
00:57:50,090 --> 00:58:01,690
really like the you, I guess like, I don't really like, um,
I don't really like the, like, like the, you know, like, you

572
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:08,170
know, like the UI thing where it feels really annoying to
look at on stream, but that's just me.

573
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,150
I just, I don't know.

574
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:15,570
Because it's like, it's like this like circular thing that's
all like flies around the screen and stuff.

575
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,350
And it feels like you do it one time.

576
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,490
Like you do a stream like that, like once or twice.

577
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:26,310
So like for me, I just, I find it like, I don't know.

578
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,710
Because we all know what I'm looking at too.

579
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,170
Like I'm not shy about it.

580
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,190
I'm like, ass.

581
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:38,150
And like, like I even, I even, you know, I've given.

582
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:42,650
them a little pat too for good luck i'll be like pat pat
wish me luck

583
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,680
i will be staring

584
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:06,160
oh and george thank you for the super chat thank you thank
you chat choose a rice cooker for you and you do a cookie

585
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:13,800
stream with it i do want to do like hand cam stuff in the
future it's just i'm always so paranoid about it so i never

586
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:22,700
have a chance to set it up also like um also like i need to
ask people like what their setups are because it's so like

587
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:31,280
i'm always like super paranoid about like what if i like hit
the camera thank you for the super chat that you did what if

588
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:40,960
i hit the camera you see a you see my floor and be like i
know where she lives It makes me paranoid.

589
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,580
I think I need to move to a new place if I ever want to do,
like, an actual CanCam stream.

590
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,220
Because I do want to open, I want to open, like, oh, no,
that's so bad.

591
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,660
I know it's going to be so bad.

592
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,960
Because I have a gotcha box problem.

593
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:00,020
This is why I don't do gotcha with my own money.

594
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,180
You know, like, you know, like, um, like the sponsor
streams, they, obviously, they, like, you know, I'm not

595
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:16,400
using my own money when I do the polls because it's like
they give me money and I use that money to do polls that

596
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:34,360
doesn't sound very that doesn't sound very smart but but
like oh gotcha boxes um yeah yeah I I do have if if I ever

597
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:43,780
go to like those like miniso or um or pop mart or like the
how what was the other one the other one it's not pop mark

598
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,400
but um

599
01:00:48,460 --> 01:01:00,280
catch is it gotcha box is that what they're called or what
are they called the little the blind boxes okay blind boxes

600
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:11,000
um what are they called okay there's another one too it's
not Popmart or Miniso.

601
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,240
There's another one.

602
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,000
But I don't remember what they're called.

603
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:19,960
It's not pop.

604
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:20,960
There's like a third.

605
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,800
Was it my plastic heart?

606
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,400
There's like a third store that sells blind boxes.

607
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,300
And I can't remember what it's called.

608
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:34,790
What's it called?

609
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:35,610
Oh, is it 50?

610
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,770
What is 52 toys?

611
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:38,310
Maybe.

612
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:40,430
But anyway, I have a problem.

613
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,410
I have a problem.

614
01:01:44,970 --> 01:02:00,770
that sells blind boxes I go in and I come out with less
money so I feel like I but and then like you know what I do

615
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:10,090
with the blind boxes after I open them it stays in a bag
tucked away in a corner because I I open the blind box it's

616
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:20,010
done I got the I see what I get I'm like oh that's cute and

Oh, but yeah, in Japan, they do these, like, end of the year
lucky bags.

643
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,770
But it's just them getting rid of old stock.

645
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:43,370

646
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:44,850

Was it Celeston?

665
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:08,070
Or like she did a thing where every time you buy something
related to her merch on gamer subs, like it added a timer,

666
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,650
basically so that the stream goes on longer or something.

667
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,310
I could do that with dog shirts.

668
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,290
I could do that with dog shirts.

669
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:28,230
And then the entire stream is just based off It's dog themed
related.

670
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:29,790
It's a dogathon.

They can thank dog shirts for charity.

706
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:33,740
Think about it.

707
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,440
How many dogs?

708
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,820
Oh my god, wait.

709
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:43,000
I could do it so that you buy the shirt and then you could
choose to donate to it to a dog shelter.

710
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,500
That is okay.

711
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,440
Wait, you buy the shirt and choose.

712
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:54,240
So if you don't have a dog, I can just donate the shirt to a
shelter.

713
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,600
I'm cooking.

714
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:01,140

You can make it a dad flush and have it come in all sizes.

776
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,450
That whole, that whole, oh my God.

777
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:39,210
And then you could dress up your dad.

778
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:42,030
You can dress up your dad flush.

779
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:43,030
Oh my God.

780
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:46,330
Wait, it's like those, it's like, it's like those pet
stores.

781
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,230
You know how in the pet stores they have those weeners?

782
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:50,210
It's always a weener dog too.

783
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:54,390
Oh, yeah, no, I want to make that too.

784
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:58,590
I've been wanting, sorry, my manager sent me, like, I still
want to make this merchandise idea.

785
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,750
I think that would sell.

786
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:04,410
I think, I think that, I think there's more, that's not for
dogs.

787
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:06,130
So, like, it's a bigger market.

788
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:10,750
Like, there's more, you know, I realized that not a lot of
people own dogs.

789
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:16,470
Or, okay, so, so I still want, I mean, I drew this on
stream.

790
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:18,970
So, I still want to make this, guys.

791
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:21,010
Your manager is, like, you can show it.

792
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,910
I still want to make this.

793
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:27,850
And I think, I think, I think this is a more successful
market.

794
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:37,210
Because, because like, more people wear underwear than they
do have dogs.

795
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:38,630
Guys, right?

796
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:45,770
I assume more people wear underwear than, like, we're boxers
than have dogs who need shirts.

797
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:51,590
So, because, like, you know, sometimes it's crazy, but I
realize that some people have their dogs naked.

798
01:17:51,610 --> 01:18:00,170
and they don't close their dogs and I realized that was also
a little thing that I didn't take into account but I know

799
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:16,870
for a fact that 99% of us here wear underwear might not be
boxers but they wear underwear yeah so so so that is a good

800
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:26,570
market I there's no way I can fail for this one that is and
I there's no way I can fail for this one the dog shirts

801
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:34,810
where it might have been the worst idea I've ever had but
but but I learned my lesson and it's like I I learned from

802
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:48,010
my mistakes guys and now I diversify it's a mouth print ours
is it a flat print we'll figure that out later We'll

803
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:49,470
workshop that idea.

804
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:51,490

851
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:41,620

01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:42,880
Influencer Smurf.

882
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,480
They actually replaced him.

883
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,840
Because everyone made fun of him.

884
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,180
And then they literally canceled him live.

885
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,140
Like, like, cancelled him in the next trailer.

886
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:22,660

And then the next trailer drops, and they literally just
removed him.

Oh, and Goff Smurf.

905
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,440
When Smurf Red turns into a Goff.

906
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,560
She turns into a Batty.

907
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:57,820
Yeah, they made Vexi, who's a bad girl.

908
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:02,760
And then she turned Smurfette into a bad bitch, too.

909
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,760
So they made Goff Smurfette.

910
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:08,340
Yeah, they did.

911
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,020
They made...

912
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,980
It's a Smurf about color.

913
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:18,900
Wait, okay, this is when they did realistic Smurf, so it's
ugly.

914
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,620
So be warned.

915
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,180
It's a realistic Smurf.

916
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,180
But they made a baddie.

917
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:26,820
And then they made Smurf.

918
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,220
And then she like sucked the color out of Smurfette.

919
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:35,950
And then Smurfette became a baddie too.

920
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:39,570
No, that's not Smurfette.

921
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,890
This is like...

922
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:43,250
This was like Vexi.

923
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:44,690
Vexi the Smurf.

924
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:46,970
What's her name?

925
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:50,390
She has Smurfette and Smurfette's sister.

926
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:52,350
Who originally was a naughty.

927
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:54,330

01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:48,590
Drunk stream.

936
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:54,330
Drunk stream where I try to explain.

937
01:31:54,350 --> 01:32:05,830
blame the plot or a history of something uh it's like i i
chug a can i chug a can of cider and i try to drunkenly

938
01:32:05,830 --> 01:32:14,610
explain riverdale again to you guys i'm not caught up with
riverdale i stopped when i stopped during the part where

939
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:21,370
jughead goes to a unit like goes to a private school and
then his teacher jumps out the window because the actor got

940
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:26,150
fired That's where I stop.

941
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:28,330
You know what's even sadder though?

942
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:34,310
The writers of Riverdale at least know what Dungeons and
Dragons are compared to Stranger Things.

943
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:42,210
I've only watched season one of Stranger Things because I
thought it was just all right.

944
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:46,670
Like I didn't think like it was like, you know, like it was
like, oh it's a cultural phenomenon to me.

945
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,290
It was just all right.

946
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:53,090
From what I read, apparently, Stranger Things.

947
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:59,490
Stranger Things whole thing, the theme of it was based off
of Dungeons and Dragons.

948
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:06,690
And like, but the writers, the creators of Stranger Things
has never played Dungeons and Dragons before.

949
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:11,090
So they're just making up shit on the fly.

950
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:13,930
They never even played Dungeons and Dragons.

951
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:17,670
They would just be like, I guess, I think that's what they
do, Degs.

952
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:20,310
Like, I was like, you don't even bother to research it.

953
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:24,330
Apparently they didn't even like, they did like the bare
minimum of research.

954
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:27,410
search um for dungeons and dragons

955
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:45,350
so um so but but like in riverdale it was more because like
the thing is riverdale they had an entire plot line based

956
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:53,170
off of like a parody of dungeons and dragons called oh my
god what was it called so it was more it was more true to

957
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:58,530
dungeons and dragons it's called Gryffins and Gargoyles, G
&G.

958
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:01,910
So, I forgot how fucking stupid that was.

959
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:02,390
Okay.

960
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:11,290
So, so in Riverdale, they had like an entire season
dedicated to G&G, Gryffins and Gargoyles.

961
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:16,690
So, they were actually playing a Gryffins and like a
Dungeons and Dragons game.

962
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:29,290
But it was more, it was more faithful to D&D than what
Stranger Things did, apparently with D&D.

963
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:36,010
I can't wait to play G&G, Griffins and Cargill Hills.

964
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:39,870
When did that season come up?

965
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:41,670
Seven years ago.

966
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:47,390
Seven fucking years ago.

967
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:51,900
Oh, it's neat.

968
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:52,920
They give us super chat.

969
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,620
They give thank you.

970
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:54,780
I still have it.

971
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:55,760
I still have it.

972
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,020
I wanted to do it, but I wanted to do like hand cam.

973
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,600
Like I said, I think whatever.

974
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:13,760
Whenever I move to a new place, I feel like I just need a
bigger room for it too, for all the stuff.

975
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:15,660
Yeah, I still have it.

976
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:16,360
I still have the jar.

977
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:35,340
It would be something in the future where I want to have
like, I want to move to a new apartment or something for it.

978
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:38,300
We have a bigger streaming room too.

979
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:45,720
for it to have a setup for handcams and stuff because i'm
just like super paranoid i'm like because my room's not that

980
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:58,060
big so like i'm always paranoid that i'm gonna fucking knock
my camera down or some shit this is not a really big room so

981
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:02,780
did we watch the dnd movie for watch that mr broken by i
think of the super chat thank you thank you i actually

982
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:08,500
watched the movie i thought it wasn't bad i don't know why i
think like the timing for the movie came out in a really bad

983
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,720
time Because that movie was actually pretty decent.

984
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:11,660
I liked it.

985
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,080
I wanted to do a Men in Blackwatch along for members.

986
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:17,040
Which reminds me.

987
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,680
I need to make a tweet about the member stream.

988
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,420
I think the server is fixed now.

989
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,560
I'm pretty sure I fixed the server.

990
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,000
Because I remember when it first came out.

991
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:30,700
People were like, oh, this movie, the movie bombed.

992
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,080
It didn't make that much money.

993
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,460
Or it didn't make that much money in the theaters.

994
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:38,160
I think also, I think back then, Dungeon Dragons were still
pretty niche.

995
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,220
But I think, like, nerd culture has now become...

996
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:52,340
mainstream now because nerds grew up and became billionaires
so now everyone's like i don't want to be a nerd now i just

997
01:36:52,340 --> 01:37:05,960
think like nerds nerd culture has become oh and the pandemic
dude nerd culture has become much more um um mainstream yeah

998
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,200
nerds have more money

999
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,380
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

1000
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:26,700
Thank you.

1001
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,460
Speaking of D&D, how about one shot with the sloppies plus
Nimi fries?

1002
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,000
Nimi has experiencing DMing.

1003
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:33,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1004
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:33,300
Thank you.

1005
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:34,940
That would be fun.

1006
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,140
I'm really bad at role playing, though.

1007
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:39,160
I didn't ask the worst.

1008
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:39,620
I don't know.

1009
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:40,600
Maybe if I was somewhere.

1010
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:42,300
I mean, I could write that.

1011
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:43,620
That's actually a pretty fun idea.

1012
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,000
DMing.

1013
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,360
D&D.

1014
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:48,820
D.

1015
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,740
I think, like, um,

1016
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:04,900
I think like I'm for me I'm just nervous about Dungeons and
Dragons Because I feel like I personally And there's just

That's such a good name, bro.

I'm so jealous.

1037
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:27,110

01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:42,500
Everyone just plays the facet of Rochella was amazing
Patrick has seen the US Super Chat Thank you, thank you

1040
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:52,400
Yeah, it's so freaking smart That's why I'm always very
anxious about D&D Because I feel like I personally am not a

1041
01:40:52,400 --> 01:41:02,480
good role player Because I just be myself That's why I never
did the GTA RP Because like Because I'm so bad at

1042
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,020
role-playing.

1043
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,820
I just want to be me.

1044
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,220
Because I'm already a character.

1045
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,980
I feel like I'm already, like, such a character in itself.

1046
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,640
Because I do, like, dumbest shit.

1047
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:20,200
Sometimes that it's just more fun to be me.

1048
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:31,350
Yeah, I'm already silly goofy.

1049
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,340
I role-playing every game.

1050
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:43,200
I just role-playing myself.

1051
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:53,280
Oh, to be fair, I roleplayed the extreme version of whatever
character I'm playing.

1052
01:41:54,100 --> 01:42:00,420
I think that's, I think I'm always play, I'm always
roleplaying as a more extreme version of whoever the main

1053
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,740
character is.

1054
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,500

1063
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:34,140
my staff will have to vet the stuff because then i have to
like not be able to see what the stuff is so i can be

1064
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:43,080
surprised but then i don't want to be mean you know we
always need a simon on the show well you know like if it's a

1065
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:49,200
talent show you always have to have the guy That's super
positive about everything.

1066
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:53,600
The Simon of the show, who's like always negative no matter
what.

1067
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:56,380
And then, yeah, we need a Simon.

1068
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:03,300
And then we need the middle judge who can be mean, but also
nice at the same time.

01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:10,880
Like we need a, yeah, we need a Randy, a Randy, a Simon, and

Magenta soup, but thank you, thank you.

1081
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,720
No idea, just repentance.

01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:02,040
I just remembered Simon.

1088
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,160
That's not true.

1089
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,620
That's not true.

1090
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:11,220
I only remembered Simon and Katie Perry, but she comes in
later.

1091

Thank you.

1106
01:47:22,490 --> 01:47:23,130
Thank you.

1107
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:24,470
What was that?

1108
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:25,290
Oh my gosh.

1109
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:27,270
Speaking of the name 100 women.

1110
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:37,190
I remember I saw a Twitter video um, where the guy named
like 100 Pokemon He did it in like less than 10 minutes.

1111
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:41,910
And then someone was like, okay, name 100 women right after.

1112
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:46,790
And then it took the guy like an hour plus.

1113
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:48,370
And people were like, wow.

1114
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:50,510
He's like, he took the bait.

1115
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:53,810
Like, bro, why did you take the bait, bro?

1116
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:54,430
Why?

1117
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:04,450
Like, bro, you fell for the bait, bro.

1118
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:09,790
And that was fucking hilarious.

1119
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:11,990
Like, I could give 100 Pokemon.

1120
01:48:12,110 --> 01:48:13,750
I was like, all right, now name 100 women.

1121
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,210
Right after.

1122
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:27,170
I'm the woman that gives nothing burger opinions.

1123
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:31,090
And the men is Ryan Seacrest.

1124
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:34,650
The tire of the randy.

1125
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:37,330
Snuffy ass to Sally Min.

1126
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,920
That's a good panel.

1127
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:48,040
Oh, my gosh.

1128
01:48:50,020 --> 01:48:51,680
I hate being sick.

1129
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,340
Uh...

1130
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:58,780
What the heck?

1131
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:01,220
What?

1132
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,040
What is this?

1133
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:05,200
Oh, okay.

1134
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,060
There was like...

1135
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:09,760
I got DM about a sponsor, and I was like, What's this?

1136
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,060
I don't remember the sponsor.

1137
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:12,960
And then I looked at it.

1138
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:14,540
I was like, oh, this sponsor.

1139
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:15,280
Oh.

1140
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:18,740
It's all blurring together.

1141
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:21,000
I, but yeah, I hate.

1142
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,420
Um.

1143
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:27,360
I hate, uh, I hate being sick.

1144
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,880
Cause it's just a cough.

1145
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:31,180
Honestly, I think it's just a cough left.

1146
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:33,920
But it like comes in randomly too.

1147
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:36,940
I didn't go to the doctor.

1148
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:38,960
Because all I have left is the cough.

1149
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:40,940
So I don't feel like the need to.

1150
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:51,380
um but but if the cough is still around by the end of this
week I will go to a doctor because I do have a lot of

1151
01:49:51,380 --> 01:50:00,480
important things I need to do and like I cannot be coughing
for I cannot have a month or two long cough guys not again I

1152
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:09,620
always say that but it's always again but not again this
time this time it'll be different I

1153
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:18,870
think it's also because I've been streaming Because, like, I
think that's why my recovery stopped, because I started

1154
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:19,790
streaming again.

1155
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:28,590
Because, like, before, like, I was recovering super duper
fast, because I wasn't streaming at all.

1156
01:50:29,030 --> 01:50:36,990
And then I just kept, I don't know, I went back to
streaming, and then my recovery just, like, slowed down in

1157
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:37,430
general.

1158
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,060
Because I'm talking a lot, too.

1159
01:50:52,960 --> 01:51:04,520
i love streaming also i need i it's my job so i need i need
to have income

1160
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:32,480
tts stream i want to have a little dragon that talks when
you guys when not for a gaming stream but when i'm like

1161
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:39,460
chilling that there's like this new this animal crossing mod
that you can use as your tts now where it makes you sound

1162
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:49,100
like crossing characters but also like um I mean those are
always fun you know like the TTS stuff but little animal

1163
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,700
crossing characters that talk

1164
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:12,990
yeah I want to do that also that means I don't have to read
it's a win-win I don't have to read no more

1165
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:22,910
but if you're talking in animal crossing language then i
have to read but i meant like if you're talking in like like

1166
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:32,930
actual language then like i that's the real intention not
reading yippee

1167
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:51,240

wonder if I can make a TTS that just sounds like me So I'm

1170
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:12,090

you play games.

01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:44,430
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1179
01:53:46,030 --> 01:53:47,830
It's not fun, it's fun, though.

1180
01:53:47,950 --> 01:53:48,930
I like talking.

1181
01:53:52,570 --> 01:53:54,150

Thank you.

1186
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:05,790
What about green screen VR chat where you take requests in a
second stream to watch drag goers make with waves?

1187
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:08,430
Totally didn't steal this idea from Jerma.

1188
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:11,470
Yeah, I totally didn't steal this idea from you.

1189
01:54:13,290 --> 01:54:15,070
Thank you for the super chats.

1190
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:15,990
Thank you.

01:54:21,550 --> 01:54:22,390
something similar?

1193
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:23,230
I remember.

1194
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:26,270
She did a stream like that too before.

1195
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:04,650
What are ideas?

1196
01:55:05,530 --> 01:55:09,650
I'm going to look through my idea notebook that I wrote
down.

1197
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:14,640
I want to do a stream.

1198
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:18,480
I collab with someone where we give shitty advice to
viewers.

1199
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:19,660
But we have a disclaimer.

1200
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:21,640
We're like, please don't follow our...

1201
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:27,160
You guys like send in like like streamer, streamer.

1202
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:27,640
Yeah.

1203
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,440
What do I do and blah blah blah and then we give like the
shittiest advice spots

1204
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:43,660
They'll be like please do not follow this place in general
Do not do that people will do it

1205
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:49,730
That's not true.

1206
01:55:49,850 --> 01:56:00,250
I give good advice Sometimes it's like a 50 50 There is a 50
50 chance

1207
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:11,220

Sorry I'm getting way too immersive Right now I'm getting

1210
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:38,440
way too in character.

1211
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:42,390
Can you?

1212
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:44,030
Yeah, such good advice.

1213
01:56:45,710 --> 01:56:47,670
Surely you'd follow...

1214
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:51,010
Surely you'll follow my advice, right?

1215
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:12,150
I want to play Neopets, the darkest fairy.

1216
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:14,290
This is not related to the creative.

1217
01:57:14,370 --> 01:57:15,950
I just really want to play that game.

1218
01:57:16,090 --> 01:57:18,250
But I have so many games I need to complete.

1219
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:21,450
Like, I accidentally started.

1220
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:32,050
way too many game series and I can't start another one I
can't start oh wait did I write this down I want to do like

1221
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:39,430
you know that market plier and most critical game series
that they did where they play five random games like they

1222
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:42,630
play five random games in the news store

1223
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:56,930
like on itch.io or like or like or on the news store front
page I think that's really fun to do.

1224
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,460
We're just like, we're just Gamba.

1225
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:05,980
Or three.

1226
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:07,240
Three is a good amount.

1227
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:08,820
Five might be too much.

1228
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,340
Yeah, we use dumpster diving.

1229
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:19,140
Steam dumpster diving.

1230
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:24,980
Or we find dead games that might have zero player base.

1231
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:29,860
Bro, you know what was a fun game?

1232
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:33,540
I don't even know if you can, you can like, uh...

1233
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:40,020
I don't like using the word, the e-word, because, like,
people can get really freaky about it.

1234
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,880
But what was it, the Pets, Pets, Pets game?

1235
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:48,320
From Neopets?

1236
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,620
Pet, Pet, Pet, Adventures!

1237
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:55,500
I really want to play Pet, Pet, Adventures, but it only came
out on the PSP, and it was such a fun game.

1238
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:08,660
I don't like saying that word because of my corpo training
because like if you say if you're in a company and you say

1239
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:21,480
that word um you get in a lot of trouble so so it's like
ingrained in my head to avoid ever saying that word out loud

1240
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:38,600
because it's for those who don't know outside of NA it's you
can get in really big trouble outside of na because it's

1241
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:44,500
very frowned upon so like it's so i don't want to get in any
trouble

1242
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:58,740
no you can actually like you get like it's actually really
it's like um outside of na it's like you can get like find a

1243
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:06,340
lot of money or like get banned from tournaments or it's
just like public wise it's like very frowned upon outside of

1244
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:18,650
na like if you like mention it like you can get in a lot of
trouble because for those who don't know i remember it was

1245
02:00:18,650 --> 02:00:27,270
like really crazy so even modding stuff because like modding
things is also like a huge no-go too outside of na um for

1246
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:38,150
people who this but um in in the smash community there was
this very uh like there was this pro player in smash from

1247
02:00:38,150 --> 02:00:50,530
japan that modded their that modded their console to fix the
lag from um yeah to fix the lag uh from the queuing system

1248
02:00:50,530 --> 02:01:01,270
um for smash brothers and then people found out and then he
basically got like a two-year ban from like tournaments just

1249
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:05,250
because like he modded his consoles to make it less laggy

1250
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:17,190
yeah and it like and every like everyone in japan agreed
about it it's actually crazy because it was like a huge um

1251
02:01:17,190 --> 02:01:24,690
culture shock for na people um because like in na people
were like what the fuck like everyone mods their stuff like

1252
02:01:24,690 --> 02:01:30,530
that's not new and in japan everyone like agreed with the
band and be like no that's the right thing to do like yeah

1253
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:36,350
no he was cheating but then in na people were like the smash
players in na in the smash community was like no this is a

1254
02:01:36,350 --> 02:01:43,530
wrongful band like you should reverse it but everyone japan
was like no this is a right band like he was he was um using

1255
02:01:43,530 --> 02:01:52,190
an advantage against other honest competitors so it was a
huge like culture um like is that the word like a huge like

1256
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:59,670
is it culture shock there's a word for it but but different
reactions from different cultures.

1257
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:04,830
He didn't do it in a tournament.

1258
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:06,690
He did it on a stream.

1259
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:11,450
Like culture class.

1260
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:12,390
Yeah, culture class.

1261
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:12,690
Yeah.

1262
02:02:13,690 --> 02:02:16,470
Like, it wasn't even, like, on...

1263
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:17,650
For a tournament setting.

1264
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:18,930
It was, like, a stream.

1265
02:02:19,050 --> 02:02:20,230
It was, he did it on stream.

1266
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:28,610
Yeah.

1267
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:34,010
And then he got, like, mega banned in Japan for tournaments
and stuff because of it.

1268
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:51,570
streamed it in japan because he forgot to turn it off i
think that was the story i don't i think that was it right

1269
02:02:51,570 --> 02:02:56,610
he accidentally had it on and then he would like he like
went to turn it off but then people already were like oh

1270
02:02:56,610 --> 02:03:01,930
wait you have a modded console oh yeah

1271
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:18,460
so it's different it's like a culture clash yeah because nap
i remember like people in anywhere super confused um people

1272
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:26,820
i don't remember it was like two plus years or something but
yeah people in n a were super confused and uh and then and

1273
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:31,440
like barely that because like you know it's a different
culture like n a people love modding stuff and in general

1274
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:41,540
but modding things is like very frowned upon outside of n a
in general it depends it depends it depends on the game it

1275
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:48,760
really depends on the game because i know like hollow knight
and silk song is has a lot of really fun mods in general,

1276
02:03:48,940 --> 02:03:57,920
and a lot of them also comes from, um, China, because China,
uh, Chinese fans really love, like, uh, Hollow Knight and

1277
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:07,940
Silk Song has a huge fan base in China, um, and a lot of
really fun mods came from, um, the Chinese fans for Hollow

1278
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:09,020
Knight and Silk Song.

1279
02:04:13,230 --> 02:04:14,570
Was it two months?

1280
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:21,270
I was two months I got confused about the dates But I know
he got kicked out of a tournament That we were supposed to

1281
02:04:21,270 --> 02:04:22,070

1282
02:04:36,190 --> 02:04:44,190

Like, let chat pick.

1342
02:12:18,270 --> 02:12:21,770

Okay, guys, maybe, though, that's a bad idea.

1351
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,200
We fake buy stocks.

1352
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:22,620
Chat picks random stocks for me to fake invest.

1353
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:37,160
I'll be like, guys, we're only spending like $10 per stock.

1354
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:46,500
If we make money, I'll reinvest in it.

1355
02:13:57,230 --> 02:13:58,370
No one can go wrong.

1356
02:13:58,630 --> 02:14:01,090
I remember always buy Costco stocks.

1357
02:14:01,290 --> 02:14:02,830
It always goes up.

1358
02:14:02,830 --> 02:14:02,950

Do you have any Apex customs plan?

1367
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:28,700
I haven't seen you bullying any Quicks pros in years and I
have a craving.

1368
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,000
I mean, thank you, the super chat.

1369
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:30,680
Thank you, thank you.

1370
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:34,500
I would love to if the servers are not shit right now.

1371
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:43,580
was in a tournament i think like a couple like a month or
two ago and like every time we started we started the match

1372
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:52,840
everyone was lagging and like i think like one like during
behind the scenes yeah it's it's apparently really bad i

1373
02:14:52,840 --> 02:15:03,080
don't know if it's still bad though is it still bad or did
they fix it or for custom servers they think did they fix it

1374
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:06,060
because i know regular servers fine.

1375
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:08,260
I just don't know about the custom servers.

1376
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:24,160
I'm going through chat.

1377
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:26,240
Backtracking right now.

1378
02:15:36,750 --> 02:15:37,310
Yes.

1379
02:15:38,450 --> 02:15:39,570
Connor has.

1380
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:40,610
Oh, that sucks.

1381
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:45,310
Yes.

1382
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:46,490
Thank you for the super chat.

1383
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:46,870
Thank you.

1384
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:47,830
Thank you.

1385
02:15:47,830 --> 02:15:50,250
You have to top 500 anything but Marvel Rivals.

1386
02:15:50,630 --> 02:16:02,990
Bro, like I, I'm like, okay, I didn't want to say anything,
but I I played a little bit of Overwatch on the side and I'm

1387
02:16:02,990 --> 02:16:15,330
like I thought I was like close to top 500 and then I found
out they fucking changed the system so so I'm literally like

1388
02:16:15,330 --> 02:16:27,650
I think I'm like master one right now um because like I know
GM is usually top 500 um I played a little bit like but like

1389
02:16:27,650 --> 02:16:34,310
okay you know what's fucking stupid you know how they're
like you need to play 750 games to be eligible for top 500 i

1390
02:16:34,310 --> 02:16:44,150
am at like 500 like like overall like for overwatch 2 you
have to play like 750 games in overwatch 2 to be eligible

1391
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:51,230
for top 500 um because like i didn't play a lot on my main
account i've been playing mostly on my like when i first got

1392
02:16:51,230 --> 02:17:01,130
top 500 um in overwatch 2 it was on my alt account it was on
my side account not my main account and and so i was like

1393
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:07,310
okay um i'll try and get on my main like i played out i want
to play a little bit on my main account because i don't care

1394
02:17:07,310 --> 02:17:16,910
as much anymore and also like streamer mode too to be
eligible you need to come you need a win by the way it's not

1395
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:30,290
even complete sorry jk it's not even complete you need a win
750 games mode and be eligible for top 500 you gotta win 750

1396
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:42,830
not complete 750 so yeah so like i'm at like 500 something
i'm so far from it so i was just like bro fuck that shit but

1397
02:17:42,830 --> 02:17:52,550
also um yeah i was like i got to masters one but like i
didn't play that much i think i played like 20 games i think

1398
02:17:52,550 --> 02:17:59,430
i was like 20 games and i got to masters one because i did
placements and i did like 10 more games i placed like master

1399
02:17:59,430 --> 02:18:09,470
something and i got one like a couple games and it was like
master one um and um usually gm gm threshold starts at like

1400
02:18:09,470 --> 02:18:18,270
sorry usually top 500 threshold starts at gm but um they
changed the top 500 for overwatch and everyone was like not

1401
02:18:18,270 --> 02:18:26,550
being like this sucks because the new top 500 leaderboard is
pay to win like sorry not pay to win it's like play to win

1402
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:33,390
it's play to win not pay to win sorry there's everything is
paid to win now but like it's play to win so like people in

1403
02:18:33,390 --> 02:18:46,750
diamond are top 500 because all they do is play the game so
so you get these every time you play a game you get these

1404
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:53,290
points and it's like uh whoever has the most like it's based
off of the points of how much the game.

1405
02:18:53,790 --> 02:18:55,770
So that's top 500 now.

1406
02:18:55,910 --> 02:18:57,030
It's not your rank.

1407
02:18:57,430 --> 02:19:03,290
So I think like rank five, the guy who's ranked five is a
master's player.

1408
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:09,030
Because all he does is play the game 24-7.

1409
02:19:09,530 --> 02:19:11,490
So he's literally a master player.

1410
02:19:11,890 --> 02:19:13,870
That's rank five.

1411
02:19:17,250 --> 02:19:17,930
Yeah.

1412
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:21,650
It's total.

1413
02:19:21,890 --> 02:19:26,610
It's like, top 500 play time not top 500.

1414
02:19:27,130 --> 02:19:29,150
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.

1415
02:19:29,370 --> 02:19:33,130
It's just I think the more wins you get the more points you
get.

1416
02:19:34,430 --> 02:19:41,030
So it's just how many whoever has the most amount of wins I
guess because you get challenger points.

1417
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:54,350
So you win points and then the more points you have the
higher ELO you are yeah so it's top 500 whoever has like no

1418
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:55,730
job I guess

1419
02:19:59,540 --> 02:20:09,220
because it's like how are you playing if you're how do you
get the enough points the no life is top 500 Kirikou's skin

1420
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:17,060
enthusiast more than like that's your resting thing even the
super chat thing it's the most unemployed it's crazy I was

1421
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:23,400
so sad because I was like, oh, I could be eligible for a top
500 in Overwatch.

1422
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:29,940
And then other than the fact that I had to win 200 more
games, I was like, bro, I'm going to, I'm, fuck, no, no,

1423
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:31,100
fuck this shit.

1424
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:39,540
It doesn't, like, it doesn't, if I'm fucking masters and I
get top 500 because I played too much, like, that's just sad

1425
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:40,160
for me.

1426
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:42,780
I was just like, like, I need to look in the mirror.

1427
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:58,020
I feel like this is who you are now because I feel better if
I'm like you know GM or even champion because now I'm like

1428
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:04,420
okay at least like it feels better you know but if I'm
master like that's my wake-up call if I'm master I'm top 500

1429
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:16,980
I'm like I like that's my wake-up call like that's the point
play to win like total playtime is fucking stupid Because

1430
02:21:16,980 --> 02:21:18,880
that's not your actual ELO.

1431
02:21:35,550 --> 02:21:38,890
Yeah, like, master player being higher than champ players.

1432
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:43,610
Because champ players, when you're champ or GM, you also
have to wait a long time to get games as well.

1433
02:21:44,070 --> 02:21:44,790
So there's no...

1434
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:51,630
Like, if you're, like, a high ELO player, you already have
to wait a super long time to even get into a game.

1435
02:21:51,690 --> 02:21:55,870
But if you're a master player, you get games instantly
because there's a lot of master players, too.

1436
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:00,720
I play for fun.

1437
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:23,260
this this info doesn't affect me because i play for a while
what a carefree life you live that guy spax 96 you're very

1438
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:34,740
employed and i applaud you he he's like i have a job I'm
very proud of you.

1439
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:40,640
He has a life.

1440
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:42,180
He has a life.

1441
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:43,120
Good for him.

1442
02:22:43,420 --> 02:22:45,220
I'm not jealous at all.

1443
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:48,760
I'm not jealous.

1444
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,500
I'm not.

1445
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:50,780
Yay.

1446
02:22:51,380 --> 02:22:52,060
Employment.

1447
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:57,100
That's sadly true.

1448
02:22:57,660 --> 02:22:58,100

I hope you had fun hanging out.

1461
02:24:45,380 --> 02:24:49,180
I always enjoy these little hangout sessions that we do.

1462
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:52,380
Anyway, guys, I have another stream tonight.

1463
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:54,860
It's a Zom Project Zomboard.

1464
02:24:55,280 --> 02:25:01,660
We have two, I think, including tonight's stream, it'll be
two more Project Zomboard stream because the server closes

1465
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:02,460
next week.

1466
02:25:02,780 --> 02:25:05,500
Yes, the server closes next week.

1467
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:09,500
Most likely, we will do our final Project Zomboard streams
on Monday.

1468
02:25:09,740 --> 02:25:10,480
Oh, my God.

1469
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:11,880
A Monday stream?

1470
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:17,040
Yes, because I want to be able to host one last gathering
with everyone.

1471
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:20,780
Before our infamous Battle Royale.

1472
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:27,540
Because before a server closes, we always have a final
Battle Royale with all the dragons.

1473
02:25:29,180 --> 02:25:30,720
And I think that will be really fun.

1474
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:31,480
Anyway, guys.

1475
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:32,560
But not today.

1476
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:33,260
Today is not.

1477
02:25:33,320 --> 02:25:37,640
Today we're going to do the plan for the Monday stream.

1478
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:42,400
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture
checked.

1479
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:44,760
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1480
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:47,200
And if you say it for me, head to bed.

1481
02:25:47,660 --> 02:25:49,180
Cause you deserve it.

1482
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:51,140
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1483
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:52,580
Well, I guess.

1484
02:25:53,060 --> 02:25:53,320
Bye.

1485
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:56,300
And also buy the dog shirts.

1486
02:25:58,480 --> 02:25:59,500
Because here's what check out.

1487
02:25:59,640 --> 02:26:01,280
We're going to check out the dog shirts, everyone.

1488
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:02,400
Check it out.

1489
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:03,760
