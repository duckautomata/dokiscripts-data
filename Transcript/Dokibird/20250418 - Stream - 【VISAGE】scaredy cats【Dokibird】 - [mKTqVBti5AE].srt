1
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,440
I can swap, I swap.

2
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:05,060
Sorry, I was like, I was trying to... I was like, pause intro because I was trying to find the scene for it.

3
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:16,740
So like, okay, guys, if like, the positioning-wise and sizes are different from part one, it's because I forgot we were doing a part two, so I didn't save any of the settings of it.

4
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,140
And so none of the settings were saved.

5
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,900
That's our Toki book!

6
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,120
And also, I might need sound balancing for the game again, because I also did not save the sound balancing.

7
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,120
Whoopsie.

8
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,960
Wait, oh no, what happened to your ear?

9
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,900
Oh my...

10
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,800
It's like a unicorn.

11
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,220
I'm fixing it.

12
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,280
Wait, what do you mean it's like a unicorn?

13
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,660
It's like, it was in the center of your head.

14
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,100
So it was like a unicorn.

15
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,520
I don't know why it does what it does.

16
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,860
Just let it happen.

17
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,760
Sorry, we were just a little bit late because we were gossiping.

18
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,660
You know, girls just being girls.

19
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,480
Hee hee.

20
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,060
Oh yeah.

21
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah, we were talking about clothes.

22
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,920
Yeah, we were talking about clothes and factories and where to get cheap Louis Vuitton bags.

23
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,720
Yeah.

24
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,900
Yeah.

25
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,980
We were like...

26
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,240
Oh yeah.

27
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,860
And then we were also talking about the Minecraft movie.

28
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,620
So Min hasn't seen the Minecraft movie yet.

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,700
Even though she was like, I'm going to watch it the day it releases.

30
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,540
Well, thank God I didn't because...

31
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,620
We were throwing popcorn.

32
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,820
Yeah, because like, we were like...

33
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,680
Because like, booze were thinking about watching the Minecraft movie when it got released.

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,140
But then people started throwing popcorn and drinks at others.

35
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,100
And eggs.

36
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,240
Did you hear how they were chucking eggs at people too?

37
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,500
I saw someone bring a live chicken.

38
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:42,980
Yeah, no.

39
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,540
I talked about it on stream.

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,520
But the guy who brought...

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,500
Because he's like a fucking influencer on TikTok or some shit.

42
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,260
And then he just left the chicken like on somebody's doorstep.

43
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,520
He just like abandoned it.

44
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,020
And then someone was like, what the fuck?

45
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,620
Why did you...

46
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,840
And he streamed...

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,820
Like he recorded himself abandoning the chicken.

48
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,760
And then people were like...

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,060
Were like, what the fuck?

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,080
Why did you do that?

51
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,040
And then he was like...

52
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,720
And then he replied with...

53
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:07,940
We...

54
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,720
Was it...

55
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,080
Like X amount of chickens are killed every day.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,100
So you could eat them.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,640
Oh my God.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,080
Wow.

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,700
So like...

60
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,240
One chicken life does not matter that much.

61
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,440
Like I was just like...

62
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,900
What the fuck?

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,280
Like what kind of...

64
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,320
Oh my God.

65
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,420
I'm just like...

66
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,760
Like what kind of...

67
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,400
What kind of person are you?

68
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,660
Like...

69
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,640
I wish I could throw him in lava in Minecraft.

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,360
Yeah.

71
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,120
In Minecraft, guys.

72
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,780
In Minecraft.

73
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,260
Yeah.

74
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,540
Yeah.

75
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm not going to fly him all the way to like...

76
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,480
One of the active volcanoes in Scandinavia.

77
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,600
And then chuck him in there.

78
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,140
Oh.

79
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:43,620
Wait.

80
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,320
We can get closer.

81
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,820
Hawaii.

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,960
Oh, that's true.

83
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,360
We can just chuck him in Hawaii.

84
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,120
Yeah.

85
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,360
Yeah.

86
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,620
Yeah.

87
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,380
Yeah, there we go.

88
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,340
Sacrifice.

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
In Minecraft though.

90
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,980
In Hawaii Minecraft.

91
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:54,560
Yeah.

92
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,360
Yeah.

93
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,760
Yeah.

94
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,580
It's all legal if it's in Minecraft.

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,640
Yeah.

96
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,540
Oh boy, Doki.

97
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,040
Are you excited for today?

98
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:07,940
Okay.

99
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,680
Let me...

100
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,080
Let me open this real quick.

101
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,320
Okay.

102
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
Let me...

103
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,560
I thought you meant the game.

104
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,100
Okay.

105
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,780
Now I'm ready.

106
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh my god.

107
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,640
All it took was one sip, you guys.

108
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,140
She's such a lightweight.

109
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
She's tipsy already.

110
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,340
I got one sip in me.

111
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,100
I'm ready now.

112
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,060
It wasn't even that bad last time.

113
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,120
Oh, you're not the one playing.

114
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,960
As the spectator watching, it wasn't even that bad.

115
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,700
I don't even have to be here.

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,680
I wasn't even...

117
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,600
Oh yeah, I remember when...

118
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:45,920
What was it?

119
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,920
The mortary...

120
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,260
This is not my charity.

121
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,720
The mortary assistant or whatever.

122
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,660
I'm like, it wasn't that bad.

123
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,620
That was the same.

124
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,620
The mortuary.

125
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah.

126
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,240
Yeah, you remember that?

127
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Oh, don't worry.

128
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,380
Don't worry, man.

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,700
It wasn't that bad.

130
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,540
Oh, you saw that guy outside the window?

131
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,780
What are you, a fucking pussy?

132
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,340
Is this...

133
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,200
Is this...

134
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
Payback for the mortuary?

135
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes, I can hold a grudge for a very long time.

136
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,580
Oh, I know.

137
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,560
Happy one year anniversary to the mortuary assistant.

138
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,930
No, it wasn't one year.

139
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,690
Happy two year anniversary.

140
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,790
Yeah, I think it's been longer than that.

141
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,430
Wow, happy anniversary, everybody.

142
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,130
I can wait.

143
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,590
A bird never forgets.

144
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,210
A bird never forgets.

145
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,530
What are you, an elephant?

146
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,910
There's literally a bird brain because birds forget.

147
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,310
This is the one thing I remember.

148
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,270
I have storage for five things, and this is one out of the five.

149
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,390
I waited.

150
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,050
I was like, counting my days till I get my turn.

151
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,470
Oh, I guess if you count crows, yeah.

152
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,150
That's true.

153
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,770
Crows are very vindictive.

154
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,470
No, that's true.

155
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,490
They can hold grudges for a very long time.

156
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:18,450
You hear, like, there's, like, there were people, like, scaring, like, a kid, like, that was scaring a group of crows.

157
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,510
And then, like, ever since they did that, like, the crows followed him where he works or something.

158
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,810
And then just started shitting on his car every day.

159
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,610
Is it crows?

160
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,430
Wait, what's the ones that imitate human voices?

161
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,450
Parrots?

162
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,610
No, no.

163
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,290
No, ravens.

164
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,510
Is it raven?

165
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,570
Or corvids?

166
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,250
Yeah, corvids.

167
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,650
Yeah.

169
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,290
Yeah, they can imitate voices.

170
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,450
No, they're pretty smart, too.

171
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,090
They're, like, but the thing is, they're as smart as, like, a six-year-old or four.

172
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,250
So, like, they're not that smart, you think about it.

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,490
I won't trust a six-year-old with anything.

174
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,750
They're smart enough to see shiny thing and then bring you something.

175
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,350
That's true.

176
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,790
Yeah, there was, like, I read a story of, like, this little girl that, like, fed crows every day.

177
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,450
And then, like, they just bring her money.

178
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:09,690
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,330
That's right.

180
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,450
Yeah, yeah, because of coins and stuff.

181
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,210
So if they see a shiny coin, they just give it to you.

182
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,670
So she has a collection of shiny things, and some of them was just money.

183
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,410
So you can have an army of the bird ticeth and the bird giveth.

184
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,970
You can train a group of crows to just get rich.

185
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,570
Get like 30 crows and just feed them every day.

186
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,650
Actually, I'm wondering, a birdseater is cheap.

187
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,890
Birdseater is really cheap.

188
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,470
Yeah, I think so.

189
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,470
As long as you don't feed them bread.

190
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,070
By the way, don't feed birds bread, because they can actually explode.

191
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,210
Oh, you know what?

192
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,090
What happened to Doki, then?

193
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,070
If you feed me bread, I'll fucking pop!

194
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,810
Some people might be excited about that.

195
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:06,490
Because it, like, expands their, like, gut-slash-heart or something, and then they can actually, like, explode or something.

196
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,570
I thought that was just rice.

197
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,550
Is it also bread?

198
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,410
Yeah, it's also bread.

199
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,790
Bread is also not healthy for birds.

200
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:28,170
And also, did you read... I saw this on Twitter, but there was this, like, not article, this Reddit post about how this girl's hamster accidentally got into, like, baking soda, and then she ate...

201
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,150
Like, the hamster ate...

202
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,430
No!

203
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,430
Wait, let me find that.

204
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,350
I was like, what?

205
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,870
Why are you finding... Don't find me!

206
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,770
No, it's not visual!

207
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,050
It's not visual, I said it, but I read it.

208
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,010
Oh, yeah, it's like, my hamster exploded.

209
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,070
So, I've been crying in my room for two hours now.

210
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,590
I was making some salad dressing in the kitchen with my pet hamster.

211
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,550
My sister and friends were also doing something.

212
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,670
I spilled a bottle of vinegar, so I left to get a towel.

213
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,990
And then when I came back, Manny was drinking it.

214
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,030
I didn't think anything of it, so I let him help me clean it up.

215
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,990
All of a sudden, Manny starts acting really weird.

216
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,170
He's normally very full of energy, but he's just sitting still.

217
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,090
Everyone gathered around him, trying to figure out what was wrong.

218
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,970
Suddenly, we hear a fizzling noise coming from inside Manny, and he started expanding.

219
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,590
He let out a final squeak and bursted.

220
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,330
Bubbles and blood went everywhere.

221
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,150
My sister and her friends started screaming and crying.

222
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,090
Irene got my dad and he cleaned it up.

223
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,070
We looked in the pantry, and apparently, Manny got into the baking soda and ate a bunch of it.

224
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,090
He said, I think I'm traumatized now.

225
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,750
Why'd you read it?

226
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,490
I think I'm traumatized now.

227
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,750
What is...

228
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,330
Don't people say, like, hamsters die in the most violent ways always for some reason?

229
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,390
Mine...

230
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,470
My sister had one, and it got washed away in a flood.

231
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,350
Oh my god, is he okay?

232
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,030
Do you think he's okay, guys?

233
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:54,910
Probably.

234
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:55,610
He's fine.

235
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,790
He, like, washed to Miami.

236
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,610
Yeah, he went to Florida.

237
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,090
He's, like, went to the deep, like, probably South America.

238
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,150
He's, like, living his best life.

239
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,370
Yeah, he's enjoying his life there right now.

240
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,390
He's probably fine.

241
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,950
He found a wife in...

242
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,650
He found a wife.

243
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,510
They had kids.

244
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,890
They started a family in, like, Brazil or something.

245
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:16,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

246
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,230
Yeah.

247
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,030
Oh, yeah.

248
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,830
Yeah, I had a friend who had a pet hamster, and it was pregnant.

249
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,130
And then the mom...

250
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,550
You know how, like, rodents eat their kids if they're stretched too much?

251
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,910
Oh, yeah, yeah.

252
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,810
Yeah, so then the mom ate all the kids except for one.

253
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,710
Because, like, my friend stopped it in time.

254
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,870
But then she...

255
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,710
The mom, like, ate half of its leg.

256
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,630
Before, like, they stopped it.

257
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,560
See, that's traumatizing.

258
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,940
That's more traumatizing.

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
So I'm just saying, like, don't stress me out.

261
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,780
Or bye-bye, men.

262
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,700
Don't worry.

263
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,800
Some people are into that.

264
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,080
That's what, vore?

265
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,560
That's what vore is.

266
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,980
I think someone...

267
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,500
I think you have to be into the vore to be vore.

268
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,540
No, like...

269
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,040
I mean, like...

270
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,000
I mean, people who watch can be into it.

271
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,140
No, I thought...

272
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,340
I think it's the appeal is the people want to experience it, no?

273
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,860
No, I thought, like...

274
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,500
I thought it was just, like, people just...

275
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,260
Well, there's, like, the person who eats the person that likes it.

276
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,160
Because they just want to feel...

277
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,200
Oh, my God.

278
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,640
Wait.

279
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,200
I don't remember if I've ever...

280
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,460
It's because they want to feel like they're a baby again.

281
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,180
No, okay.

282
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,820
Okay, this is, like, really fucked up.

283
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,820
But, like, one of my friends sent me this.

284
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,200
I don't know if I've ever talked about it on stream.

285
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,580
Or, like, if I ever talked about it in my previous channel.

286
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,280
But one of my friends sent this to me as, like, a joke.

287
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,360
But there's, like...

288
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,780
You know how, like, vore is, like, a specific hink, right?

289
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,780
So, like, people can have replicated that experience.

290
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,200
Like, I got sent to this, like...

291
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,300
You mean, like, what the fuck?

292
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:20,900
I was, like...

293
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,660
And then I, like, looked into it.

294
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,180
Because I was, like, what the fuck?

295
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,640
Because, like, it's their entire account.

296
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,920
It was a Twitter account.

297
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,680
And it was basically, like...

298
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,240
This...

299
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,780
It was, like, this inflated belly suit thing.

300
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,540
And then they put someone inside the belly.

301
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,520
And then you see, like, hands poked, like, just trying to...

302
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:51,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

303
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,700
Do you wanna lick?

304
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,380
Do you wanna see what...

305
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,160
No, I'm fine.

306
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,280
I'm...

307
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,540
My eyes are pure.

308
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,060
Your eyes are not pure.

309
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,640
Don't fuck with me.

310
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,980
You've seen many things.

311
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,320
That's what I'm here for.

312
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,740
If you share it with me, you have to share it with the class.

313
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,100
Okay.

314
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,300
Don't share it with me.

315
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,280
Don't share it with me.

316
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,220
How do you have the link on hand?

317
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,280
No, I don't have it.

318
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,640
I'm searching it up.

319
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,040
I know exactly what it looks like because it's been...

320
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,520
If I was sent this, everyone has to see it.

321
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,940
I don't have to click it.

322
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
I don't have to click it.

323
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,810
I had to... I was sent...

324
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,780
Oh no, she found it.

325
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh my god!

326
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,040
Oh my god, it's just as fucked up as I remembered.

327
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
It's...

328
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,060
It's just...

329
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,220
It's so sad.

330
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,280
It's so sad that I don't want it now.

331
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,680
I don't want it now.

332
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,680
You think I wanted it when I first saw it?

333
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,720
You can stop the cycle.

334
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,980
No, I will continue the cycle.

335
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,140
I will continue it.

336
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,990
It's like...

337
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,580
I bet you won't retweet it.

338
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,500
No, I won't.

339
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,280
No, I won't.

340
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,800
I will not retweet it.

341
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,740
That's a reminder.

342
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,760
I mean, you can...

343
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,120
Feel free to retweet it.

344
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,720
No, it's your account.

345
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,080
Feel free.

346
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,780
It's your account.

347
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,200
Yeah.

348
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,120
It's a video.

349
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,900
Oh my god.

350
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,700
It's a video!

351
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,920
I can just see the...

352
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,580
I can...

353
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,540
So I have, like, my window, like a...

354
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,160
Firefox window half covering Discord.

355
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:02,700
Yeah.

356
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,020
So I, like, just see a preview of, like, the little furry face sticking out.

357
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
I don't want this!

358
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,740
Why?

359
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,820
I don't want that!

360
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,200
Did you post it in the chat?

361
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,680
You can post in the chat if you want to.

362
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
No, you have to.

363
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,740
It's yours.

364
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,100
What do you say about stop the cycle?

365
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,860
Oh, so you want me to continue...

366
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,220
I'm not having this.

367
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,640
So you want me to continue the cycle.

368
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,960
You're like, you can stop the cycle.

369
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm stopping the cycle from here.

370
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,920
After sending it to Mint, I need to stop this.

371
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,280
It's like a cursed link if you don't send this to five people.

372
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,920
Yeah, send this to five people or you'll be in that stomach.

373
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,200
Do you want to stop the cycle, Mint?

374
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,240
I don't think I can post links in your chat, I'm on a mod.

375
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,120
Don't worry, I'll mod you so you can stop.

376
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh, really?

377
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,680
Alright, let me just try something in chat, Mint.

378
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,740
Do you want your mod?

379
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,540
We can stop the cycle, but I don't think... Here, let me try.

380
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,280
I'm not even gonna... I'm not gonna... I'm not looking at this.

381
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,560
I'm not even looking at... Oh my god, it's so horrible.

382
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,380
Just the preview is so...

383
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,040
No!

384
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,360
Wait, I don't want this.

385
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,540
I don't want people to be like, look at the thing Mint posted.

386
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,420
It's from you.

387
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm not watching this.

388
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,480
I'm not doing this.

389
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,980
You can see... You can see the person in there, right?

390
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,460
You can see them trying to get out, right?

391
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,700
I think I see what looks like knees.

392
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,670
That's what I was saying.

393
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:07,630
It's like... You can be the person who eats the guy or the guy in the stomach.

394
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,690
You can do whatever I know.

395
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,490
You know, if you don't... If you don't finish Visage, you're gonna go into that stomach.

396
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:18,470
You have to... You have to... You have to... Are you gonna be... Are you against your stomach?

397
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,570
No!

398
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,490
No!

399
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,650
It's gonna be this guy.

400
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,270
It's gonna be... This guy, the specific random guy.

401
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:24,990
Yeah!

402
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,310
If you don't finish Visage, you'll get into this man's stomach.

403
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,850
You have to finish... You have to finish the game.

404
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,010
Or you'll get bored.

405
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,350
You know what?

406
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,250
Wait, I can see his foot.

407
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,190
Like, it's a...

408
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,810
Why are you watching it?

409
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,410
I don't consent to watching this person's game.

410
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,030
God damn.

411
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,130
You said it was fictional.

412
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,670
I'm here to prove you wrong.

413
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,790
You can...

414
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,130
I should... I could... I should never doubt...

415
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,130
Never... Never doubt my knowledge.

416
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:13,010
Not... Not just your knowledge, but the strength of... of... perversion.

417
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,450
The lengths people will go to.

418
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,310
Oh my God.

419
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,170
I forgot... I forgot to, like, unbind my reposition button.

420
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,590
Okay, give me a sec.

421
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,070
Oh, oops.

422
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:24,930
Whoopsie.

423
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,830
Let me... I need... I realized that, like, I didn't lock my position too.

424
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,610
Give me a sec.

425
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,030
I need... Sorry, I was too... I was too busy with showing Mint something very important.

426
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,970
Her secret stash.

427
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,650
She found it so quickly, you guys.

428
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,790
You guys want... You want to know what I Googled?

429
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:48,490
You...

430
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,350
You Googled it!

431
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,450
You had to Google it!

432
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,170
I had to Google image this.

433
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,810
I had to Google it!

434
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,130
I had to Google...

435
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,510
I had to Google image to find exactly what I was explaining to you.

436
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,470
I...

437
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,870
Nah, yeah, she had it bookmarked.

438
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,350
She definitely had it bookmarked.

439
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,310
Alright, locked.

440
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,310
I don't care about immersion right now.

441
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,250
We just...

442
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,830
We don't care about immersion.

443
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,410
We saw things.

444
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,890
What are you doing?

445
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,410
Immersion.

446
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,270
Oops.

447
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:18,790
No immersion.

448
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,470
Whoop, nobody saw that again.

449
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,610
Nobody saw that.

450
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,590
Nobody saw that.

451
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,110
Whoop.

452
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,550
Nobody saw.

453
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,670
Nobody saw.

454
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,170
Nobody saw.

455
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,310
Yep, everything's fine.

456
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,170
Everything's fine.

457
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,950
Alright.

458
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,030
Oh my gosh.

459
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,590
What was that?

460
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,530
I want to explain more about something before we started.

461
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,950
I was like, oh, I'll explain more later, but I forgot what it was.

462
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,630
We have... we jumped through, like, so many topics that...

463
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,670
I'm exhausted right now.

464
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,850
Alright, let me finally boot up the game.

465
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,330
Sound guy, I hope you're still around.

466
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,030
Oh, yeah, have you ever... remember when, like, um, what was it?

467
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,490
Was it Snuffy or Daimu that was asking us to try out Schedule 1?

468
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,510
Do you remember that?

469
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,450
Oh, I think it was Laimla.

470
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,110
Yeah, yeah.

471
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:08,970
So, like, originally, like, we were sort of, like, bringing up the idea of playing Schedule 1 together as sloppy sisters, but then, like, I think all of us just got busy.

472
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:09,990
Yeah.

473
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,350
Yeah, we all just got busy, so we never, like, had that.

474
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,510
But I played Schedule 1 a couple of days ago with some friends.

475
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,010
Um, it's very addicting, let's just say.

476
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,910
Is it?

477
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,610
It's, like, um, it's a simulator, right?

478
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:28,190
So, like, it's, like, so you do something over and over again, and it's incredibly addicting.

479
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,830
Just, like, making drugs.

480
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,970
So, just...

481
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:34,570
What?

482
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,270
Is it better with... Wait, did you play it multiplayer?

483
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,490
Yeah, it's better... If you do single player, you can actually, like, get so overwhelmed.

484
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,350
So, like, even when I had, like, two other people playing with me, like, it was so much work and everything.

485
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,090
Um, but, like, I don't know if I could ever play this, like, on stream, because I get, like, so absorbed into it.

486
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,350
Like, I would be like, okay, I'm just gonna play it for, like, an hour.

487
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,330
And then, like, five hours passed.

488
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,490
So, like, I highly suggest you to not play Schedule 1, because I was not doing work for the last two days.

489
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,530
Oh, damn.

490
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:12,350
I got, like, I got, like, I got, like, scolded by my manager, because he was like, you gotta write that tweet draft for your sponsor.

491
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,570
And then I was like, and then I lied.

492
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,710
And I was like...

493
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,410
You lied!

494
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,990
It's okay.

495
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,710
I lied, and I was like, sorry, I just got home.

496
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,230
Sponsor, don't listen.

497
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,350
Sponsor, don't listen.

498
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,010
Sponsor.

499
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:33,910
But the thing is, but the thing is, I didn't need to finish writing that tweet, uh, the draft for yesterday, because it was actually for next week.

500
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,890
So I was like, oh, okay, I got it done early.

501
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,370
That's how you, that's how you justify it.

502
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:41,810
Got it.

503
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,530
Because I, I was like, oh, sorry, I just got home, like, an hour ago.

504
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,550
But in, in actuality, in reality, I got home, like, four hours ago.

505
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,690
Does your manager watch your stream?

506
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,590
He's asleep now.

507
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,230
Because that's why I checked if he was online before I said that.

508
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,470
I was like, okay, is he online?

509
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,390
Okay, he's offline.

510
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,590
He doesn't know.

511
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,650
He doesn't know.

512
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,710
Guys, don't timestamp this part.

513
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,930
Oh, yeah, that chat totally listens every time.

514
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

515
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,090
The one time I said, don't timestamp, they'll definitely, you know.

516
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,350
They'll listen, they'll listen.

517
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,850
Listen, or I'll send, or I'll continue the cycle.

518
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,250
She will retweet the video, you guys.

519
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,530
I will continue the cycle if you timestamp it.

520
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,410
Okay, play the game.

521
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,550
I booted the game.

522
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,430
I booted the game.

523
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,970
Don't worry.

524
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,430
Yeah, but you booted it.

525
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,290
I booted it.

526
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,190
All right.

527
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,290
Screen share.

528
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,290
Oh, yeah.

529
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,110
Can you just watch with the stream itself?

530
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,930
All right.

531
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,530
How is it still early access?

532
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,970
It says, visage early access.

533
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,770
No way.

534
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,790
There's no way.

535
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,710
This game has to be done by now.

536
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,210
Is it not?

537
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,130
It should be.

538
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,530
Oh, my God.

539
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,770
Why am I streaming at 1440p?

540
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,390
You are not getting that quality.

541
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,930
It doesn't say early access for me.

542
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,930
It's like early access for, like, your screen.

543
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,150
Like, when you game capture it.

544
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,630
Yeah, I'm giving you 1080.

545
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,810
You're not getting 1440p.

546
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,570
I need to get this thing off the screen.

547
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,290
He's just dot, dot, dot, dot.

548
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,410
I can just delete it.

549
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,090
Actually, no.

550
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,270
I'm keeping it in our chat logs.

551
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,450
Actually, you know what?

552
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:26,630
Good.

553
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,490
I'm going to screenshot that you said this.

554
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,430
As, like, evidence?

555
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,930
Wait, I'll be like...

556
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,950
I'm editing my message.

557
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,390
Send this to five people.

558
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,850
Or you'll get bored.

559
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,330
Continue the cycle.

560
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,210
Continue the cycle.

561
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:46,430
There.

562
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,690
Now you can screenshot it.

563
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,950
I already feel like screenshotting it is, like, a curse.

564
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,150
It's gonna break my computer.

565
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:03,350
You're like, I give you permission to tweet the screenshot of the screen.

566
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,170
Send this to five people.

567
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,050
You'll get bored.

568
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:08,430
Yeah.

569
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:09,990
I don't know what.

570
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,430
I don't want to do that.

571
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,670
I don't even want to do that.

572
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,550
Oh, then you'll get bored, man.

573
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,010
He's gonna get you.

574
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,510
Look at him.

575
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,450
He's so hungry.

576
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,450
He's so hungry.

577
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,030
I don't think he's hungry.

578
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,070
He actually looks quite full.

579
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,710
He'll never be satisfied.

580
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,290
How hungry.

581
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,930
How hungry.

582
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,690
Oh, man.

583
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,010
Back at it again.

584
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,470
I would count down the days when I have to do a part two.

585
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:43,850
All right.

586
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,990
I think the worst part is that I have no idea where any of the pills are.

587
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,150
I've not been grabbing any, like, survival equipment.

588
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,170
Does it reset after each chapter?

589
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,610
No.

590
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,870
No, because there is a chance.

591
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,170
Why do we have a lizard map?

592
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,510
Yeah, you have a chance to actually softlock yourself.

593
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,430
No, that's evil.

594
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,190
It is.

595
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,950
That's why I'm, like, really afraid.

596
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,510
No, that's evil.

597
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,350
I'm really scared of softlocking myself right now.

598
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,490
All right.

599
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,290
Okay.

600
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,810
So, we just...

601
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,350
Wait, where...

602
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,210
Oh, yeah.

603
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:15,750
This is...

604
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,330
It's the...

605
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,230
Where you put the...

606
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,010
What was it?

607
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,270
Yeah, back up.

608
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,190
A finger or something?

609
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:20,830
I don't remember.

610
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,230
Oh, so...

611
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,290
Yeah, so we're back here.

612
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,030
I mean...

613
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,370
Do I have a light, right?

614
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:25,790
Yeah.

615
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,570
Yeah.

616
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,670
I'll just put the light here.

617
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,610
No, that's a candle.

618
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,090
I don't know where the...

619
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:30,470
That's a candle.

620
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,990
Where the lights are supposed to go.

621
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,110
In the lamps.

622
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,190
Wait, it's dark.

623
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,290
Where's the...

624
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,610
Right there.

625
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:39,990
What?

626
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,510
Oh, there you go.

627
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,390
Wait, how am I going crazy?

628
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,670
Oh, my God.

629
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,630
How am I going crazy already?

630
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,590
This is not good.

631
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,470
What do you mean you're going crazy?

632
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,330
It gave me, like, the little...

633
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,350
That thing where it was, like...

634
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,370
Oh, there's, like...

635
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,470
Don't stand in the deck.

636
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,530
Don't stand in the...

637
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:55,990
Yeah, yeah.

638
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,110
I was, like...

639
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,550
How...

640
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:57,990
How is it?

641
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,810
Am I already crazy?

642
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,410
Wait.

643
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,990
You missed one behind you?

644
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,010
Yeah, but I need to fix this.

645
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,970
Oh.

646
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,570
Okay.

647
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,270
There you go.

648
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,410
Did I use my flashlight?

649
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:06,950
No, I...

650
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,170
What?

651
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,790
Okay.

652
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:09,690
All right.

653
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,630
Time to start the next chapter.

654
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,690
It's this one.

655
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:13,850
What's this?

656
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,710
I don't know the key, but, like...

657
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,130
I don't know.

658
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,670
I don't know what's what.

659
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:18,450
If...

660
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,390
If...

661
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,210
If he can't...

662
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,350
If he has this, that means that whoever's chasing me can't walk properly.

663
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,850
So he can't get to me as fast.

664
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,390
Ah.

665
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:25,850
Wait.

666
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,790
Someone said...

667
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,350
You know there's a storage room downstairs full of items.

668
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,390
Oh.

669
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,210
Is that true?

670
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,250
Okay.

671
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,070
We'll grab that later.

672
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,510
Yeah, but I have to go to the basement.

673
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,350
And I don't want to go to the basement right now.

674
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,290
All right.

675
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,270
You could.

676
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,210
No.

677
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,850
I'm worried something's gonna show up.

678
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,650
If I go to the basement.

679
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,130
I have...

680
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm a little concerned about that.

681
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:50,910
All right.

682
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,130
I brought the game volume up.

683
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:52,450
What?

684
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,670
Oh, no.

685
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,910
I was just reading it.

686
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:55,790
Okay.

687
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:56,770
Yeah?

688
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,230
Wait.

689
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:57,970
I actually need a blow...

690
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:58,070
Oh.

691
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:58,790
Whoa.

692
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,250
What was that?

693
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,530
I heard a slam.

694
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:01,930
The floor shot.

695
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:02,690
Yeah.

696
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,270
Okay.

697
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:03,930
Okay.

698
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,430
Before I start...

699
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,750
Oh.

700
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,330
Okay.

701
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,870
Before I start the game...

702
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,650
Let me, like, grab water.

703
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,330
You go entertain chat real quick.

704
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,050
What?

705
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:13,790
Okay.

706
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,760
Okay.

707
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,440
Are you gone?

708
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,020
Hello?

709
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,220
Okay.

710
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,220
Hey, guys.

711
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,840
I think...

712
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,100
I might leave in the middle of the stream to go get pizza.

713
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,300
What have I left right now to go get pizza?

714
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,920
She'll never...

715
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,200
She'll never play the game, though.

716
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,860
Send the link.

717
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,260
No!

718
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,060
I don't want to look at it anymore.

719
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,560
I don't want to look at it anymore.

720
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,620
Because I didn't get that pizza last week.

721
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,120
I've, like, since been craving my pizza.

722
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,340
Well, I tried to have the pizza last week.

723
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,120
Is pizza all you eat?

724
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,520
No!

725
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,680
But I...

726
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,360
But I burned my...

727
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,040
So I kind of want pizza.

728
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,260
Oh.

729
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:07,940
Never mind.

730
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,400
She's gone.

731
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,660
Set up a voice box that just randomly says words.

732
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,380
It'll be like, behind you.

733
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,880
Behind you.

734
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,120
Behind me?

735
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,280
Yeah.

736
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:20,640
Oh.

737
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,000
What's behind me, huh?

738
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,080
What are you trying to do?

739
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,860
What are you trying to set up in my chat, huh?

740
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,720
No, I was saying...

741
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,240
No, I was saying...

742
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
I was saying the pizza.

743
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,140
I want pizza.

744
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,100
Yeah, but what does...

745
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,940
What's that in context of behind me?

746
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,100
Huh?

747
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,500
I don't know.

748
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,400
What happens if you look behind you?

749
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,740
I don't know.

750
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,040
The pizza might be behind me.

751
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,340
A wall?

752
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,300
A wall?

753
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,200
Why'd you put your shades on?

754
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,820
It's like, okay.

755
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,960
Because I forgot I binded that.

756
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,940
Do you have a stream deck?

757
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,440
I do, but I...

758
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,180
I'm lazy.

759
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,180
Because if you...

760
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,520
If you get the stream deck...

761
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,660
And then you turn off, like, the key binds...

762
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,260
It still works.

763
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,340
Yeah, I know.

764
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,820
But I'm lazy.

765
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,640
Just that lazy.

766
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm not lazy.

767
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,320
Just that lazy.

768
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,020
I'm just a lazy cat.

769
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,280
You know, like, the type of cat that just...

770
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,160
I've never owned a cat, so this is all assumptions on how cats are, like, from watching videos.

771
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,980
You mean Garfield?

772
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,140
Yeah.

773
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,040
From watching Garfield.

774
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,380
From watching Garfield.

775
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,740
I found out recently that you're not supposed to give your cat milk.

777
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,720
Like, it's all, like, a myth.

778
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,340
Like, what happens?

779
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,000
Do they explode?

780
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,000
Like...

781
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,880
No, I think cats are just somewhat lactose intolerant.

782
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,160
Wait, they're lactose intolerant?

783
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,140
Yeah.

784
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,620
Then why do they drink their mom's milk?

785
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,160
I don't...

786
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,320
If they're lactose intolerant, then why do they...

787
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,720
Wait, if your lactose...

788
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:54,960
Well, babies drink...

789
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:07,560
If you're lactose intolerant...

790
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,740
Because it's, like, a different species.

791
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,560
I don't know.

792
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,060
It's different milk.

793
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,840
So, like, if you're lactose intolerant...

794
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,700
I mean, if you're a baby...

795
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,320
As long as, like...

796
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,220
As long as it's a human milk, it's okay.

797
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,660
So you can fish your...

798
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,080
If you're a baby, you're probably exploding shits anyway.

799
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,040
So it's kind of...

800
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,820
How would you tell?

801
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,900
Oh!

802
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,460
That's true.

803
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,680
So, like, you can just give your baby lactose...

804
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,960
Like, you can just give your baby milk and it doesn't matter.

805
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,440
Because they're always shitting anyway.

806
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,180
Yeah.

807
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,540
I think that's probably how it is.

808
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,720
You're saying you can develop lactose intolerant as a mutation?

809
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,380
So, like, if you get lactose intolerant...

810
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,680
Like, if you become lactose intolerant...

811
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,800
Can you still...

812
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,540
And you're older?

813
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,440
And you really want milk?

814
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,260
Can you just drink human milk?

815
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,580
Or is that frowned upon in society?

816
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,340
Oh, no.

817
00:31:59,440 --> 00:31:59,820
We're...

818
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,420
We're encroaching on a different...

819
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,520
A different...

820
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,060
I think...

821
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,580
You're like...

822
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,140
Stop...

823
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,300
Stop the conversation!

824
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,560
We can't...

825
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,220
We've already hit our fetish quota.

826
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,100
That's not a fetish!

827
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,340
Yes, it is!

828
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,760
Yes, it is!

829
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,660
One question!

830
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,820
And you really miss milk.

831
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,140
And it's like...

832
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,320
You know, it's your favorite type of drink.

833
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,780
Or, like, food or whatever.

834
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,440
And so, like...

835
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,820
And you have lactate!

836
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,240
You...

837
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,360
Or you drink...

838
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,140
You drink...

839
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,620
What do you mean?

840
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,260
You have lact...

841
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,300
You drink your own milk?

842
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,060
What?

843
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,680
What do you mean?

844
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,800
What do you think lactate is?

845
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
You said lactate!

846
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,380
I was like, what did the...

847
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,480
What do you mean?

848
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,900
No, lactate!

849
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,500
Aid!

850
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:41,940
Aid!

851
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,780
I'm not just telling you...

852
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,740
Lactate!

853
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,440
So you can drink your own milk.

854
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,760
Yeah, I was like, okay.

855
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,300
I was like, damn it, that's freaky.

856
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,560
I was like, you're on your own with that one.

857
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,040
I'm not touching that.

858
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,580
Just induce lactation because it's from your own body.

859
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,420
Yeah, from your own body.

860
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,260
You gotta feed your milk obsession.

861
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,040
I think if someone were to do that, they'd have much other issues.

862
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,060
Yeah, I was just gonna say, like, what is, okay, there's that.

863
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,000
But I was like, isn't like, it's like, it's like drinking urine.

864
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,500
Where, like, if you drink urine, it's like, it's bad for you.

865
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,370
I'm taking the bottle away from you.

866
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,170
What did I tell you?

867
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,010
Unpause the game right now.

868
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,090
I probably had two sips.

869
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,950
Unpause the game right now.

870
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,150
We'll take another sip.

871
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,630
Oh my god.

872
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,690
Sorry, I meant, it's like drinking sweat.

873
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:02,790
Like, drinking...

874
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,270
I meant that, guys.

875
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:11,710
Alright, alright, alright, let's start the game, guys.

876
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,330
Yeah, let's start the game!

877
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:14,410
Woo!

878
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:16,990
Woo!

879
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,170
Woo!

880
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,010
Woo!

881
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,110
Woo!

882
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,790
You know what you signed up for.

883
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,610
Unfortunately, yeah.

884
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:25,750
Alright.

885
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,350
You played Craft Mine, or the all-seeing eyes.

886
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,290
Oh yeah, I played Craft Mine.

887
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:30,510
Oh yeah, I played Craft Mine.

888
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,130
I was Craft Mine.

889
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,870
It was actually really good.

890
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,050
Oh, I just realized I had the fucking lighter on the entire time, that's not good.

891
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,510
Oh yeah, it's gonna waste it.

892
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,690
The all-seeing eyes.

893
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,290
What do we do here?

894
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:44,930
I don't know.

895
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,870
I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

896
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,550
Like...

897
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:51,830
Uh...

898
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:53,830
Uh...

899
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,230
Uh...

900
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,590
Uh...

901
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:54,650
Uh...

902
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:55,930
Uh...

903
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,510
Is it parents' bedroom?

904
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,550
Game is...

905
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,290
Guys, there's no volume in here, in general.

906
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,690
Oh, there's a wheelchair now.

907
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,570
Yes, there is.

908
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,650
I hear tons of volume.

909
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,430
I know, but...

910
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,790
Oh, really?

911
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,150
Oh.

912
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,270
Yeah.

913
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,590
There's a wheel...

914
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,910
Was this wheelchair there before?

915
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,470
Oh, it was definitely not there.

916
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,090
I don't remember this.

917
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,230
It was definitely...

918
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,690
Oh!

919
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:14,970
Oh!

920
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,070
I'm paraplegic now.

921
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,250
Hello.

922
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:21,530
We can play that...

923
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,010
That new Switch game that's coming out.

924
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,870
Wait, what new Switch game that's coming out?

925
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,830
The, like, wheelchair basketball.

926
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,270
There's wheelchair basketball?

927
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,390
Yeah, it's for the Switch too.

928
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:30,910
Oh!

929
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,530
I heard, like, it's gonna be more expensive than, like, what it was advertised.

930
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,510
Oh my god!

931
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,390
What is happening?

932
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,490
What the fuck is...

933
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,250
Am I gonna get abducted?

934
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,530
What the hell?

935
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,890
Why are we screaming?

936
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:43,910
What the hell?

937
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,830
Oh no!

938
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,210
Don't make me walk!

939
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:50,890
No!

940
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,470
I love my wheelchair!

941
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,890
He grew back his legs.

942
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,530
Yeah.

943
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,410
He just...

944
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,510
It was really painful...

945
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,330
It's like, it's like...

946
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:57,830
It was like a lizard.

947
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,930
Yeah and then they're like...

948
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,590
They're, like, baby legs too.

949
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,470
They're...

950
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,450
They have to grow...

951
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,410
It's like grow a baby.

952
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:06,890
They have to grow...

953
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,930
Put it in water for it to grow on.

954
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,270
Have you ever had those grow-a-babies?

955
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,750
Grow-a-ba-b... Oh, I've had like, lizard ones.

956
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,890
Yeah, I had like a grow-a-baby one.

957
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,830
Where it was like, a little like, you know, pruned-up baby.

958
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:29,430
And then you like put it in a water cup and then it just becomes a bigger pruned-up baby.

959
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,970
Make the game louder.

960
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,350
Alright, don't worry.

961
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,330
You're being told to do so.

962
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,490
I'm pausing the game so I can make the game louder.

963
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,710
That's the only reason she's pausing the game, guys.

964
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,170
Yes, that's the one time.

965
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,070
Oh, there he is.

966
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:43,370
Hello.

967
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,350
Oh, oh my god.

968
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:45,590
Hello there.

969
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,170
Are you okay?

970
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,950
An actual person.

971
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,270
Are you okay?

972
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,810
He's a real man.

973
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,570
I can't.

974
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,010
I got invisible walls.

975
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:52,330
Oh.

976
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:53,890
Sir.

977
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,530
Look, that's the fourth person I'm going to send the chainmail to.

978
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,430
That's the second person I'll send the chainmail to.

979
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,010
You have to send it to five people or...

980
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,890
That's why he looks so distressed.

981
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,110
Yeah, no, he's scared.

982
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,890
He's like, he heard it and he disappeared.

983
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:11,990
He disappeared.

984
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,850
No, he received it and he doesn't know what to do with it.

985
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,650
He's just like... He's reading it.

986
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,990
This is what it was.

987
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,490
This is what he was reading.

988
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,350
He's like, who do I send this to?

989
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,410
It's so horrible.

990
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,130
Oh.

991
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,070
Oh, there he is.

992
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,590
You get so off.

993
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,130
This is so sad.

994
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,110
It's like a table facing the wall.

995
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,970
Like, where's the... Yeah, and the binds are closed.

996
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,210
Where are you... Like, you can literally move the table, like, three steps to the left.

997
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,890
Yeah.

998
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,090
What?

999
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,550
Well, something's wrong with the radius.

1000
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,370
What the fuck is this?

1001
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,150
Oh.

1002
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:43,850
What is it?

1003
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:44,790
What is it?

1004
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,490
It better not be what I think it is.

1005
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,390
What is it?

1006
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,050
It's the boar link.

1007
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:49,590
It's the boar link.

1008
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,750
Who said this to me?

1009
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,030
Who said this to me?

1010
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,910
Who could it be?

1011
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,360
That's gonna be the whole storyline.

1012
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,820
Oh, he's mad.

1013
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,160
I'm sorry for sending it to you.

1014
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,640
Oh, no.

1015
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,560
He hates books.

1016
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,880
He's trying to find his phone books.

1017
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,740
He can send it to five more people.

1018
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,200
Put on a shirt, my guys.

1019
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,880
Yeah.

1020
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,680
You know, Pisa, you think you get me...

1021
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,780
Is it like a miniature camera?

1022
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,400
Oh, he's paranoid.

1023
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,120
He's schizo.

1024
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,660
Oh, he thinks people are watching him.

1025
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,580
Oh, that's probably what he thought was in the radio.

1026
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,880
Oh, remember they're always watching, like, the eye thing or whatever?

1027
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,920
So, he thinks everybody's watching him.

1028
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:45,920
Oh.

1029
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1030
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,800
Do I just go up?

1031
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,260
Up I go.

1032
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,820
Up you go.

1033
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,400
It's so dark.

1034
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,180
I don't think I go up.

1035
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,240
It's an invisible wall.

1036
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,140
Oh, just kidding.

1037
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,760
Wait, where do I go?

1038
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,620
Do I go to this chair?

1039
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,400
Do I just sit in it?

1040
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,060
No.

1041
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,340
Oh, here.

1042
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,200
Oh, there it is.

1043
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,560
Yeah, I forgot he went the other way.

1044
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,720
Oh, we go to the...

1045
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,040
I guess we go here.

1046
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,440
No, it's too dark for that.

1047
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,540
Oh, yeah.

1048
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,180
Oh, there he is.

1049
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,020
Oh, my God.

1050
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,060
Wait, he sees me?

1051
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,320
Whoa.

1052
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,660
I thought it was just a ghost.

1053
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,260
I was like, g-g-g-ghost.

1054
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,440
G-g-g-ghost.

1055
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:23,780
Shoot me.

1056
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,420
Oh, oh, he did.

1057
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,180
What are you going to do?

1058
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,740
Shoot me?

1059
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,540
Ask and you shall receive.

1060
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,440
I...

1061
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,760
Oh, he sees Shadow Man.

1062
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,140
Oh, my God, Tar Man.

1063
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,100
Oh, Tar Man.

1064
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,500
Oh, my God.

1065
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,580
Wait, I don't like that.

1066
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,600
Leave me alone.

1067
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,600
I don't like that.

1068
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,420
You're going to see that guy too, maybe.

1069
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,660
Yeah, I was going to say, I feel like I'm going to see him now.

1070
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:51,920
Uh-oh.

1071
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,660
Uh-oh.

1072
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,120
Uh-oh.

1073
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,860
Wait, is that pillows?

1074
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,340
No.

1075
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,640
I don't know where to go.

1076
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,920
Wait, there's the tar.

1077
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,360
Nah, that...

1078
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,840
It's from the previous chapter, I think.

1079
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,360
Oh!

1080
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,200
Oh!

1081
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,580
I think you found where to go.

1082
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,900
The door is...

1083
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:07,920
The door is...

1084
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,980
Oh, the...

1085
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,500
Oh!

1086
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,360
Oh, I don't like that.

1087
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,860
I don't like that.

1088
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:12,960
I'm going to...

1089
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,360
The eye seems to be alive.

1090
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,560
Just stab it.

1091
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,460
Alright, yeah, I'll just poke it.

1092
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,100
Got your eye.

1093
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,520
He-heh.

1094
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,740
Is there, like, light here?

1095
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,040
Yeah.

1096
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,360
Yeah.

1097
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,180
I don't trust anything.

1098
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,440
Oh, there's another wheelchair.

1099
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,460
Yeah.

1100
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,640
Oh, you just sit in the wheelchair every time?

1101
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:29,780
Yeah.

1102
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm just immersing myself in my role, you know?

1103
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,120
Yeah.

1104
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,700
What's that word called when you're, like, fully immersed?

1105
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,820
Like, actors who get fully into their role?

1106
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, I'm just method acting.

1107
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,060
I want to be that guy.

1108
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,340
I don't think you do.

1109
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,600
I want to be just like him when I grow up.

1110
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,220
Oh my god, you're going to see the tar, man.

1111
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,940
Oh, never mind.

1112
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,580
He made a new room.

1113
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,020
God wants me.

1114
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,160
Because I've been a good...

1115
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,300
I've been a good girl.

1116
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,580
I've been a good kitty.

1117
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,700
This is extreme home renovation.

1118
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,100
Move that bus!

1119
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,480
Oh my god, the loading times.

1120
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,540
Dr. Smith?

1121
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,120
Oh!

1122
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,720
Where am I?

1123
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,860
Yes, sorry.

1124
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,600
I'm with you.

1125
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,720
I have the information you requested concerning the patient that came in tonight.

1126
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,680
Okay.

1127
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,680
He claims that someone broke into his house and tried to strengthen him.

1128
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:24,900
Okay.

1129
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,460
He used his firearm in an attempt to defend himself.

1130
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,740
What's weird is that there's nothing in the police report that indicates...

1131
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,520
Oh, so...

1132
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,920
He thinks there's someone there?

1133
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,240
But they all seem self-inflicted.

1134
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,420
Oh.

1135
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,220
Oh.

1136
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,100
See, that's the problem.

1137
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,880
I had neighbors.

1138
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,060
Why is that a problem?

1139
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,020
The neighbors have to ruin the fun.

1140
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,300
Yeah, we're having a party over here.

1141
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:53,980
Yeah.

1142
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,080
Party crashers.

1143
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,840
Who called the cops?

1144
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,960
Had really bad cases of what?

1145
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,160
Scope-pop-phobia?

1146
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,060
The fuck is scope-pop-phobia?

1147
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,180
Maybe that's the people spying on you?

1148
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,060
Spying on you?

1149
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,360
Yeah.

1150
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,760
Oh, game volume low.

1151
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,920
Okay, don't worry.

1152
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,560
I'll do it up a little more.

1153
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,700
You guys don't need to hear this.

1154
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,200
They're not- it's not important information.

1155
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,040
Scooby-phobia?

1156
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,160
Scooby-phobia.

1157
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,800
Scooby-dooby.

1158
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,980
Oh, Metal Gear.

1159
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:25,660
Oh my god.

1160
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,220
It's been nine years.

1161
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,140
Don't open dead inside.

1162
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,340
Don't dead open inside.

1163
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,380
Don't dead open inside.

1164
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,400
All right, let me open.

1165
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,800
And then it becomes a zombie game.

1166
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,360
Wait, this is literally the same layout as the beginning of Metal Gear.

1167
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,040
It's The Walking Dead.

1168
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,120
I'm Rick.

1169
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,380
I'm Rick now.

1170
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,480
What is that dog?

1171
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,220
Wait, what is that?

1172
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,680
What is that dog?

1173
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,280
Why is it above my head?

1174
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,620
Is it a dog or a goat?

1175
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,500
I can't tell.

1176
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,200
It's a dog.

1177
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,920
It's like the poodles.

1178
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,200
It's like, don't worry.

1179
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:07,640
Oh.

1180
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,400
The dog will save you.

1181
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,980
It's like a renaissance version of a dog.

1182
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,500
Kind of messed up looking.

1183
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,500
Why is it like above my bed?

1184
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,620
Like, is she gonna hear me or something?

1185
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,900
Okay, so I have no items on me.

1186
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,380
So, I can't go crazy if I have no items on me.

1187
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,340
There's a diamond dog.

1188
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:27,880
Yeah, exactly.

1189
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,080
I like how you agreed with that.

1190
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,340
You don't know.

1191
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,260
I don't know the reference.

1192
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:32,560
Yeah.

1193
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm just be like, what?

1194
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

1195
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,220
Code white in room 2-3-2-3.

1196
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,520
I'll go to the exit.

1197
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,120
Wait, there's someone watching me.

1198
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,200
See that?

1199
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,140
You can go to 3-2-3.

1200
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,000
Hell yeah, I see that.

1201
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,100
I'll just leave.

1202
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,800
Go to 3-2-3, maybe?

1203
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
Or I could just leave.

1204
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,240
Wait, I can open this.

1205
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,080
Oh, I don't like that.

1206
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,260
Ew, hospital areas are gross.

1207
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:00,920
I don't like this.

1208
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,660
I don't like this.

1209
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,620
I don't like this.

1210
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,900
Wait, but it says exit.

1211
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,000
It says an exit.

1212
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,500
Do I have to go to 3-2-3?

1213
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,600
Like you told me to?

1214
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,560
You could keep going to the exit.

1215
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,640
That's 3-0-1.

1216
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,240
Is that the exit?

1217
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,120
All right.

1218
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,720
What is this?

1219
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,880
Oh, wait, what's that down there?

1220
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,300
It doesn't seem...

1221
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,140
It's just a can.

1222
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,080
Somebody's just littered outside.

1223
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,980
Someone littered in the hospital.

1224
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,760
I can't believe it.

1225
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,660
When anyone's thinking of the children.

1226
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,860
I think this is where I came out.

1227
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah.

1228
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,080
Oh, you could just...

1229
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,400
Oh.

1230
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,860
This is where I came out.

1231
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,200
I don't think so.

1232
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,120
Yeah, it is.

1233
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,920
This is my bed.

1234
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,300
It is?

1235
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,660
Oh wait, no, it is not.

1236
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,200
No, it's not.

1237
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:46,600
Yeah.

1238
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,780
They all look the same.

1239
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,280
It's like a hospital or something.

1240
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,860
Yeah, it's like all the rooms are like...

1241
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,560
The same.

1242
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, did you see like a picture on Twitter?

1243
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,220
There's some hospital have like a children's like decorated bedrooms and stuff.

1244
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:11,620
And there was this lady that went to the emergency room and they put her in like a fucking ocean themed room with like a giant octopus.

1245
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,640
What?

1246
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,560
That sounds awesome.

1247
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,960
Yeah, but like if you're...

1248
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,200
If you're on like some form of like, um...

1249
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,220
Oh.

1250
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,320
What's it called?

1251
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,160
The sleep meds.

1252
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,320
You wake up to see a giant octopus in your room.

1253
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,000
A giant fucking octopus in your room after a surgery?

1254
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,300
Okay.

1255
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,140
Yeah, I think I would.

1256
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,560
Okay, I think this is where I came from.

1257
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,260
Where the fuck is 323?

1258
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,160
Yeah, coming out of anesthesia and then you're just like...

1259
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,720
Yeah.

1260
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:45,900
303.

1261
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,080
I think you can explore a lot of these rooms.

1262
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,100
Wait, what the heck was that?

1263
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,120
You didn't even look in there.

1264
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,340
My game crashed.

1265
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,420
Fatal error!

1266
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,060
You explored too many rooms.

1267
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:57,660
No way!

1268
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,020
You did not progress the game fast enough.

1269
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:01,960
Whoops.

1270
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:02,640
Wait, oh no.

1271
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,060
Alright, I'll screen share.

1272
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,560
I wonder how much it will...

1273
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,420
I think I would just be in the room, right?

1274
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,660
Most likely.

1275
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:11,780
Hopefully.

1276
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:12,520
Hopefully.

1277
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:12,540
Yeah.

1278
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:13,640
Alright, I hear you.

1279
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,080
They're like, explore faster.

1280
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,800
Wait, did you share it?

1281
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,320
Yeah.

1282
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,020
It's not up.

1283
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:24,500
Oh.

1284
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,840
This is shared.

1285
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,220
It's up, it's up.

1286
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,480
Okay, let me make sure it's at 1080p.

1287
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,500
Okay, yeah, you're not getting 1440p.

1288
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,200
I'm not...

1289
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,780
She's denying me!

1290
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,740
If you want 1440p, go open the stream.

1291
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,540
You know what?

1292
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,140
Fine, I see it in lower quality.

1293
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,800
It's less scary.

1294
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,680
You get to see it in a full HD.

1295
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,800
Or...

1296
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,460
Or...

1297
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,740
I could go to options.

1298
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,240
Go to video.

1299
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,320
Turn everything down.

1300
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,180
Yeah, there you go.

1301
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,520
Okay, I gotta pee, so you go find 323.

1302
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,840
Okay, 323.

1303
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,800
I can find 323.

1304
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,640
I should be here, because it's like...

1305
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,220
Forward.

1306
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,180
I didn't go forward yet.

1307
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,980
I swear to God, if things start happening when, like, she went to the bathroom, I swear to God.

1308
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,700
Oh, there's a key!

1309
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,100
Oh, I got the key!

1310
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,820
I mean, I don't have any items, so like, it can't be that scary.

1311
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,060
I also need to blow my nose.

1312
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:20,860
Give me a sec.

1313
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,640
Nose break!

1314
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:28,670
Alright.

1315
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,470
Alright, it can't be bad.

1316
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,510
I'm not going crazy, and I have no items on me.

1317
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,570
So, like, nothing's gonna be chasing me or anything.

1318
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,110
I can, like, take this slow.

1319
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:43,590
It is a little concerning that there's nobody else in the hospital but me.

1320
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,390
It's almost like, like, Walking Dead right now.

1321
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,190
What could be happening?

1322
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,830
Stop stalling.

1323
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:51,290
Don't worry.

1324
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:51,790
I don't want...

1325
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:55,110
I want to make sure she doesn't miss out on the good stuff that's happening.

1326
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,610
I'm just making sure.

1327
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,050
I'll wait out here like a good cat.

1328
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,610
Don't dead.

1329
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,850
Don't dead inside open.

1330
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:06,130
It's alright.

1331
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,390
It's literally right here.

1332
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,630
I'll sit in the waiting room.

1333
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,570
I'll sit in the waiting room like a good kitty.

1334
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,270
Check out more paintings.

1335
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:15,090
There's more paintings?

1336
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,690
It's just renaissance paintings right here.

1337
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,050
Not that interesting.

1338
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,390
There's just...

1339
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,010
that.

1340
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,990
And then there's some books here.

1341
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,130
That's like...

1342
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,510
A Sunny Day.

1343
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,630
What a nice book.

1344
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,870
And then there's this painting by Van Gogh.

1345
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:33,770
And then...

1346
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,370
And then there's like the lovely nurse's office.

1347
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,470
Where they're doing math homework.

1348
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,130
Why the fuck is there math homework at the...

1349
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,430
Why is there math homework in the nurse's office?

1350
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,530
Like who the fuck is doing math here?

1351
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,170
Who the fuck brought their kid to...

1352
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,630
To a scary hospital?

1353
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,390
Oh no, I'm stuck.

1354
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,430
Oh no.

1355
00:48:59,530 --> 00:48:59,790
Okay, wait.

1356
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,150
No, no.

1357
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,010
I can fix this.

1358
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,150
Oh no, I have too many things in my hand.

1359
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,330
How did I pick up this chair?

1360
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,330
How did...

1361
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:07,950
Get this chair.

1362
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,610
Get this chair out of my hand!

1363
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,090
Oh god.

1364
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:11,790
Oh god.

1365
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,490
Okay, I got one thing out of my hand.

1366
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,070
All right.

1367
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,290
Figured it out.

1368
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,230
I don't know how...

1369
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,810
I don't know how I had a chair in my hand.

1370
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,070
But everything's okay.

1371
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:19,570
Yeah.

1372
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:20,430
Look, see?

1373
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:23,110
I waited for you before I went inside the room.

1374
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,050
Thanks.

1375
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,730
I'm gonna order pizza.

1376
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:26,370
Ooh.

1377
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,530
So I don't burn it myself this time.

1378
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,050
Oh yeah.

1379
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:31,510
Is this not 323?

1380
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,430
Or is it 4?

1381
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,010
Wait, what do you mean?

1382
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:33,410
You...

1383
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,270
You waited?

1384
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:34,850
Oh.

1385
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,770
Oh yeah, I said I waited for you.

1386
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,930
Oh yeah, there you go.

1387
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,730
Yeah, I wanna make sure you didn't miss out.

1388
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:40,870
Oh, it's right here.

1389
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:42,070
Oh yeah.

1390
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,530
Nothing's going on in there.

1391
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,910
Yeah, nothing's going on in there.

1392
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,210
It's like happening behind you.

1393
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:52,670
Wait, there's nothing in here.

1394
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:53,450
Okay.

1395
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,250
Yeah, there's nothing in here.

1396
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,630
Yeah.

1397
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:55,870
Okay.

1398
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,030
Did I open the wrong door?

1399
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,150
No, this is the right door.

1400
00:49:59,370 --> 00:49:59,390
No?

1401
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,410
That's the right one?

1402
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,550
Yeah, what the fuck?

1403
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:03,370
What am I supposed to do in here?

1404
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:05,250
Oh.

1405
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,970
I have to put my hand through it.

1406
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:09,810
What is that?

1407
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:10,770
I'm sorry.

1408
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,410
The quality is so low, I can't really tell what's going on.

1409
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,410
It's 1080.

1410
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,330
Sorry, I don't get my HD experience.

1411
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:21,930
Sorry.

1412
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,450
It's just like really...

1413
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,950
Yeah, it's just like so pixelated.

1414
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:25,990
I can't see anything.

1415
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:26,310
Yeah, yeah.

1416
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,810
That like the 10 pixels I needed.

1417
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,710
Like I can only see at 1440p.

1418
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,830
If anything's lower, I'm legally blind.

1419
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:34,890
Yeah, sorry.

1420
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,110
Where's my 4K?

1421
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,890
I need to like break it?

1422
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:40,530
But how?

1423
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,690
A sledgehammer?

1424
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,710
Yeah, but I didn't see it.

1425
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,290
I didn't see any hammers or anything near me.

1426
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:51,930
My friend.

1427
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,030
My friend.

1428
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,510
About my special eyes.

1429
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,110
Look, look with your special eyes.

1430
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,410
What do you see?

1431
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:05,630
Oh?

1432
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,290
Oh.

1433
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:07,950
Oh.

1434
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:08,970
Are you getting chased?

1435
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:10,330
Wait, is there somebody?

1436
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:10,490
I don't think so.

1437
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:12,690
Just turn around.

1438
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,250
Is there someone there?

1439
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:14,810
No.

1440
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,550
I think it's coming from the chair.

1441
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:20,990
Spooky chair.

1442
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,590
Oh, nobody's around me.

1443
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:24,850
Check in the room.

1444
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:25,390
Go...

1445
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:25,990
Yeah, check in here.

1446
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,410
There's nothing in here, no?

1447
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,250
That's where I found the key.

1448
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,450
I keep accidentally picking up stuff here.

1449
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:33,390
Uh oh.

1450
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,910
I don't like this.

1451
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,650
If I slowly walk, nothing bad will happen to me, right?

1452
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:39,910
Yeah.

1453
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:40,590
Yeah.

1454
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,330
That's how horror games work.

1455
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,350
Just slowly walk over.

1456
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:46,870
Oh, wow.

1457
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:47,110
Oh, wow.

1458
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:47,570
Wait, who's crying?

1459
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:49,570
Why are you crying?

1460
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,240
Who's crying over here?

1461
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,980
I don't hear crying.

1462
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:58,620
I think that's you.

1463
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,400
Oh, it's over here.

1464
00:51:59,420 --> 00:51:59,640
Look.

1465
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,260
No, it says cries.

1466
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:02,380
Cry.

1467
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:02,640
Oh.

1468
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,280
Yeah, I was like, where's the crying?

1469
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,800
Oh, there it is.

1470
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,620
There's my crowbar.

1471
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,480
Hey!

1472
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,920
Oh my god, we're in Half-Life!

1473
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,260
Yeah!

1474
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,240
We're in Half-Life!

1475
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,940
Now it's a real Half-Life game.

1476
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:17,840
All right.

1477
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,080
I feel safer with Crowbar.

1478
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,660
Yeah, me too.

1479
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,600
I feel a lot safer.

1480
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,300
Half-Life, let's go!

1481
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,500
You cannot escape Half-Life.

1482
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,680
Break open the...

1483
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,680
Break open the vending machines.

1484
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,680
Wait, I'm lost.

1485
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,340
Oh, it's right here.

1486
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,280
Everything looks the same.

1487
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,280
Why can't hospital look different?

1488
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,440
I got lost in the hospital recently.

1489
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,720
Wait, why were you at the hospital?

1490
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,280
For my grandma.

1491
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,620
And I got lost, like, for a long time.

1492
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,640
Couldn't figure out where to go.

1493
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,480
Oh yeah, quick save.

1494
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,100
I forgot.

1495
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,360
Oh, it'll tell you that you can't use it.

1496
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,560
Yeah.

1497
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,400
Don't worry.

1498
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,000
Quick save.

1499
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,980
Wait, what was quick save again?

1500
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,580
I don't remember.

1501
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,860
Saving is disabled.

1502
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,620
Why is it always disabled whenever I want to save?

1503
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:12,980
That's right.

1504
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,440
Life's not fair.

1505
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,180
Nope.

1506
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,110
All right, here we go.

1507
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:25,750
I just...

1508
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:26,390
Oh wait, no.

1509
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,090
There's another door here.

1510
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,190
Oh, there's another key.

1511
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,330
No, there's a key.

1512
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,890
It says meeting room, third floor.

1513
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:33,410
All right.

1514
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,870
And I can save now, right?

1515
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,150
I can save now.

1516
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:37,530
You can save now, right?

1517
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:37,690
Okay, all right.

1518
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:38,910
Nope, all right.

1519
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:39,370
That's fine.

1520
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:39,770
What is the point?

1521
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:41,750
What is the actual point?

1522
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,530
That's fine.

1523
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,410
I don't need a save.

1524
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,490
There's no way that this is...

1525
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,370
That it just...

1526
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,630
It just decided to be like...

1527
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,410
No saving for you.

1528
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,030
What?

1529
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:54,570
Oh my god, he can walk!

1530
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:55,630
Oh, fuck off!

1531
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,130
I think you need to go!

1532
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:57,630
I thought you were there for the EJ!

1533
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:58,190
He can walk!

1534
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:00,530
Why can't you walk?

1535
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,950
Wait, he's not even that close to me.

1536
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,470
I think he's pretty slow.

1537
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,890
Oh my god, the flashing lights.

1538
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:07,630
I don't like that.

1539
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,330
I don't like that.

1540
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:08,970
I don't like that.

1541
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:09,770
Wait, where is he?

1542
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,110
I'm gonna...

1543
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:11,610
He's real slow.

1544
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:13,470
Yeah, he's so slow.

1545
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,510
Let's go towards the red now.

1546
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,950
Yeah, I feel like I have to go here.

1547
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,310
Like, it's not even...

1548
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,090
He's just a man.

1549
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,230
Like, it's not even that scary.

1550
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,370
It's just a dude.

1551
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:24,590
Oh my god!

1552
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:25,450
A man!

1553
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,690
Oh, he was right there the whole time!

1554
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,530
Wait, but he is half naked.

1555
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,450
This guy never puts on a t-shirt.

1556
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:33,930
I think that's the scariest part.

1557
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,270
Because you know he has no fear if he's not wearing anything.

1558
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,290
He fears nothing.

1559
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:41,990
He fears...

1560
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:47,230
Anyone who doesn't fear society's judgment is terrifying.

1561
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,430
Oh my god.

1562
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,390
My fridge, like, went off, too.

1563
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,630
Like, I heard, like, my fridge outside did, like, the...

1564
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,730
sound.

1565
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,090
Like, the ice maker?

1566
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:04,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1567
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:05,230
The transit wing?

1568
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,270
Where the fuck is that?

1569
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,530
Great question.

1570
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,450
I can't go out.

1571
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,270
It's jammed.

1572
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:14,910
What's on the TV?

1573
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:17,230
All right.

1574
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:18,650
What's on the TV?

1575
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:19,030
I can't wait.

1576
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:19,930
Oh, exit.

1577
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:20,430
Oh!

1578
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:21,150
Oh!

1579
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:23,670
Where is the exit?

1580
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:24,570
Oh, it's the window.

1581
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,310
I have to find a window?

1582
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,270
A window that says exit all over it.

1583
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:29,850
Yeah.

1584
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,090
Oh, can I pick...

1585
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,090
Oh, I can pick up a flashlight.

1586
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,210
Wait, there's footprints on the ground.

1587
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:36,110
There is?

1588
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:36,750
Oh.

1589
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,030
Wait, he was on the table.

1590
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,130
I think he also had pizza.

1591
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,250
Oh, I can push this.

1592
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:42,770
Ah!

1593
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,390
Oh, now things can be pushed.

1594
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:50,270
I swear, though, this is probably going to be a door that opens the other way.

1595
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,250
Oh, never mind.

1596
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:51,790
Nope.

1597
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:52,730
It's fine.

1598
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:53,370
I lied.

1599
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:54,090
Follow the footprints.

1600
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:54,810
Follow the footprints.

1601
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:55,350
It ended.

1602
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,350
Did he, like, throw wings or something?

1603
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,370
Like, what happened?

1604
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,610
Like, did a miracle happen?

1605
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:01,270
He cleaned...

1606
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,030
He cleaned his feet.

1607
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,390
He got Red Bull.

1608
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,350
Oh, nice.

1609
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,730
How nice of them.

1610
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,270
I don't think they would offer that at a hospital.

1611
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,090
I don't think that's, like...

1612
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:13,270
If you mix medication with Red Bull...

1613
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,530
That does not seem like a good time.

1614
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,950
Well, it's a good thing you're at the hospital.

1615
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,310
Oh, that's true!

1616
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,350
You didn't try anything at a hospital.

1617
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:23,370
Oh, hey.

1618
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,250
He's right there.

1619
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:26,210
I'm gonna walk over to him.

1620
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,230
Yeah, go follow him.

1621
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,030
Yeah, what are you doing over there, sir?

1622
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:29,650
Oh, he's gone.

1623
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:30,890
Wait, is that the window?

1624
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,450
Oh, no.

1625
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:33,470
No...

1626
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:34,030
Probably not.

1627
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,650
It says I have a key to the...

1628
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,670
I don't remember what it said.

1629
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,610
Wait, meeting room, third floor, the one...

1630
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:42,230
Oh, no, no, that's the transit wing.

1631
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:44,050
Oh, the transit wing.

1632
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,490
Where the fuck is the transit wing?

1633
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:46,530
Uh...

1634
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,510
Is that the staircase?

1635
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:49,530
Try it.

1636
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:50,910
Go to the stair.

1637
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:51,930
Wait, check the...

1638
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:52,790
Check the signs here.

1639
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:53,430
To the right.

1640
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,690
Something chasing me?

1641
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:56,790
No?

1642
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,050
I think that was a wheelchair.

1643
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:00,950
Oh, no.

1644
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,630
A wheelchair.

1645
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:02,570
It says it's locked.

1646
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:03,870
Is it that wing?

1647
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:07,650
Who's angry at me?

1648
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:07,890
Oh, wait.

1649
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:08,630
Maybe this is it.

1650
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:09,810
Oh, no.

1651
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:11,390
No, that's a psychiatric.

1652
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:12,350
Psychiatric ward.

1653
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,430
Where's the transit wing?

1654
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,150
Oh, is that the exit?

1655
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:16,830
No.

1656
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:17,490
Wait, it's over here.

1657
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,070
It's all ready.

1658
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,370
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1659
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:20,210
See, exit.

1660
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:21,950
Alright.

1661
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:22,670
Okay, easy.

1662
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,790
Look at that.

1663
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:24,890
We're so good at puzzles.

1664
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,110
I know.

1665
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:27,230
Wow.

1666
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,690
Wow.

1667
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:28,530
Oh, hey, he's over here.

1668
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,110
Oh, he's right there.

1669
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,550
John, do a flip.

1670
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:31,830
Don't do it!

1671
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,350
I'll follow him.

1672
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:35,150
Yeah.

1673
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,630
Alright, don't worry, sir.

1674
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,810
I'll save you!

1675
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,550
Yeah!

1676
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,350
What's the worst that could happen?

1677
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:53,750
He's gonna jump at you right now... We literally said it was gonna happen!

1678
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:56,730
I thought he would do it in front of me!

1679
00:57:58,910 --> 00:57:59,430
He

1680
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,870
literally called this happening.

1681
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,950
Okay, I thought it would be in front of me.

1682
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,570
Oh, wait.

1683
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,410
My sanity is decreasing fast.

1684
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:16,750
What the hell?

1685
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,750
We just got here!

1686
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:18,710
I just got back.

1687
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:19,530
I just got back.

1688
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:20,690
You can't do this to me.

1689
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,150
Is this the house?

1690
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:23,390
Yeah, it is.

1691
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:24,930
But there's trees now.

1692
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,670
There's trees growing everywhere.

1693
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,030
Do I have to go this way?

1694
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,490
I like what they did with the place.

1695
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,710
Yeah, just follow the big veiny one.

1696
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:35,230
Yeah.

1697
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,910
Okay.

1698
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,230
Oh, there's the eyes.

1699
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:42,130
Hello.

1700
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:42,630
Oh.

1701
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,010
Oh.

1702
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:44,490
Oh.

1703
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:45,150
Oh.

1704
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:45,550
Oh.

1705
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,130
Just... Okay.

1706
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:47,090
Okay.

1707
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,110
Like, why did it do that?

1708
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:53,170
Why did it just... Oh, that guy might need an eye.

1709
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:54,270
And that might need an eye.

1710
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,990
I think I need to poke their eyes out, right?

1711
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:56,510
Yeah, see?

1712
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:57,630
That one.

1713
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,070
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1714
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,970
Take that eye.

1715
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:01,570
And then I need to poke another eye out.

1716
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,970
Yeah, get rid of their eyes.

1717
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,370
Oh.

1718
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,030
No eyes here.

1719
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,370
I feel like there's... They're like connected.

1720
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:14,290
I feel like the ones that are connected to the vein need eyes, right?

1721
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:14,770
No.

1722
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:14,970
No, no.

1723
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:15,510
They're like...

1724
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,190
Cause, like, last time I poked eyes out.

1725
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,370
I need to find the remaining eyes.

1726
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,550
Okay.

1727
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:22,810
Wherever they are.

1728
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:24,270
The eyes.

1729
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:25,310
The eyes.

1730
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:26,010
Special eyes.

1731
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,210
Wait, was that one?

1732
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:27,630
No.

1733
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,210
There's no eyes in there.

1734
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:30,890
Where are all the eyes?

1735
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:32,330
What's the music for?

1736
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:32,730
I don't know.

1737
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,470
Are you getting chased?

1738
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,230
I don't know.

1739
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,310
I think I'm getting chased, but I'm too ignorant to know.

1740
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:39,950
We ignore?

1741
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,330
I'm too stupid to realize I'm getting chased right now.

1742
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:44,930
Oh, there it is.

1743
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:45,590
There's the other one.

1744
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:46,170
We do not perceive?

1745
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:47,510
There.

1746
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,630
That should be... It was two.

1747
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:49,790
There, there.

1748
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:50,630
How do you know it was two?

1749
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:51,430
Cause I looked!

1750
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,990
I looked at it!

1751
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,750
Okay, man, you are not paying attention.

1752
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,130
Sorry, I'm waiting for my pizza.

1753
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:04,450
The only issue is I forgot where the actual area door is.

1754
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,190
Oh, you'll find it.

1755
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:06,430
There it is.

1756
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:06,770
Oh, it's over here.

1757
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,910
Was I being chased at all?

1758
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:10,070
Like, was that it?

1759
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,930
No, I think they just wanted to, like, spook you a little.

1760
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:14,570
Alright, here's another chair.

1761
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:15,730
Yeah!

1762
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:16,930
Yeah!

1763
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,770
I need pizza to think.

1764
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,830
Hello.

1765
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,510
I'm just messy acting.

1766
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,590
I'm just like him.

1767
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:36,210
Oh!

1768
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:36,910
Oh!

1769
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:38,010
Man!

1770
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:38,810
Wait.

1771
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,570
Gosh, I wish this guy would put on a shirt.

1772
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,070
Oh my god!

1773
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:42,510
Wait!

1774
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:43,090
Oh!

1775
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:44,710
This is not you!

1776
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:45,670
You don't have hair!

1777
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:47,030
Oh!

1778
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,350
I think he has a lot less than me.

1779
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:50,830
He's messy!

1780
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,450
Okay, but, like, where's his hair, though?

1781
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:56,890
Oh!

1782
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:57,890
Oh, there it is!

1783
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:58,630
Oh, there he is!

1784
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,290
Nice.

1785
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,830
I wish he would put on his eyes, you...

1786
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,990
I know!

1787
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:11,990
Put on your eyes, you freak!

1788
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,550
His eyes, his nose, his mouth.

1789
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,030
Conformed us aside, he sounded a beauty!

1790
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,770
And he's making all the other guys take off their shirts, too!

1791
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,490
He's like...

1792
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:24,130
He's like...

1793
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:25,030
He's like the messiah.

1794
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:25,770
Anti-strike witches.

1795
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:27,550
Anti...

1796
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,550
What the fuck is this?

1797
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:30,070
Strike...

1798
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:30,570
What?

1799
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:31,950
You know strike witches?

1800
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,150
How they're anti-pants?

1801
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:34,230
He's anti-shirt.

1802
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:35,270
There's an actual...

1803
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:35,950
Is that a cult?

1804
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,450
Where, like, they just don't wear pants?

1805
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:38,610
No, it's...

1806
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:39,510
Well, it's an anime.

1807
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:40,290
Oh!

1808
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,450
That is like...

1809
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:42,710
Oh, look!

1810
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:44,590
Yeah, it's a cult.

1811
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,170
It's a cult.

1812
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,410
It's just a...

1813
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,710
Oh, saving...

1814
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:47,810
Oh!

1815
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:49,950
Oh, he just walks away.

1816
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,510
He was like...

1817
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,410
He was...

1818
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:53,650
He was voguing.

1819
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:55,290
He was, like, striking a pose.

1820
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:56,510
Strike a pose.

1821
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,630
And then just decided, like...

1822
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:00,050
Yeah, I'm done.

1823
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:01,650
Yeah, like, my job here...

1824
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:02,850
It was like a flash mob.

1825
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,650
He got moved to the next area.

1826
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:08,810
Where's our guy?

1827
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,470
Where's the next part of...

1828
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,730
Oh!

1829
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:11,090
Oh!

1830
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:12,250
Oh, guys!

1831
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:13,050
Hey, guys!

1832
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,890
I don't think they, like, that I touched him.

1833
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,130
I don't think they...

1834
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,510
Yeah, I don't think they wanted me in there.

1835
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:21,870
Yeah, I don't think...

1836
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:22,510
No, I...

1837
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,110
I don't think they wanted me there.

1838
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,130
They're like, why are you wearing a shirt?

1839
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:26,390
This is taking a long time.

1840
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:27,290
Yeah!

1841
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,750
Yeah!

1842
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,310
No shirt!

1843
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:35,290
No shirt!

1844
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:36,330
No shirt!

1845
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:37,350
No tie!

1846
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,110
All service!

1847
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:39,790
No life!

1848
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:40,850
No life!

1849
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:41,370
No life!

1850
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,450
Sir, you're a bit too close.

1851
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,830
Your skin touched my skin.

1852
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,030
And I don't like that.

1853
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:51,830
We need to have at least, like, five centimeters apart.

1854
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:52,770
He felt fabric and he, like...

1855
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:52,810
Yeah!

1856
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,310
He felt the...

1857
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:54,950
Oh, wow.

1858
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:55,830
That's where it saved.

1859
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:56,850
That's kind of crazy.

1860
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:58,250
Okay.

1861
01:02:58,990 --> 01:02:59,110
Yeah.

1862
01:02:59,210 --> 01:02:59,450
Oh, my God.

1863
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:00,310
They're a little underwear.

1864
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:00,650
Stop!

1865
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,750
Don't look at their crotches!

1866
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:02,850
Stop!

1867
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:05,970
It's right in my face!

1868
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:10,570
Whoa!

1869
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,370
Wow!

1870
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,590
There's women in this gold!

1871
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,810
Yeah, are you okay now?

1872
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:14,450
Are you okay now?

1873
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,670
Can I do that now?

1874
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:16,590
Are you...

1875
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,590
All is well.

1876
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,690
Oh, so that works.

1877
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:21,310
Okay.

1878
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,630
I like how the...

1879
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,610
The key for the stairs is just like a little zigzag drawing.

1880
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:33,830
Yeah, it's like stairs.

1881
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,010
People will get what it means.

1882
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:38,590
I don't really know.

1883
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,570
I'm like, you get it, you know?

1884
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:40,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1885
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,650
Oh, my God.

1886
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:43,910
I'm experiencing something.

1887
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:44,910
Oh, my ears.

1888
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:45,670
Ow.

1889
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:46,570
Oh, wait.

1890
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:47,830
Oh.

1891
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:49,350
Oh, I'm supposed to run.

1892
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,930
Oh, I think I'm supposed to run now.

1893
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:53,530
Check, just in case.

1894
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,010
Oh, yeah.

1895
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:54,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1896
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:54,810
They're kinda...

1897
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:55,750
They're kinda close.

1898
01:03:56,110 --> 01:03:57,410
They're kinda very close now.

1899
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:58,290
There you go.

1900
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:00,350
Alright.

1901
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:01,230
Are they gonna be outside?

1902
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:02,510
That was like the shortest...

1903
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:04,670
Oh, that was the shortest chase scene I've ever had.

1904
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,410
Ever had.

1905
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:05,890
Yeah.

1906
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:08,590
They're like...

1907
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,350
Saving is disabled.

1908
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:13,930
I don't think saving is ever enabled in this game.

1909
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:16,090
Wait, but it's red.

1910
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:17,990
I just keep going down?

1911
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,190
I guess I just keep going down.

1912
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:20,550
But what if...

1913
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,510
But this is an emergency.

1914
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:24,770
It's not a fire emergency.

1915
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:26,150
Alright.

1916
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,370
Wait, I need to use the bathroom.

1917
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:29,470
I'll be right back.

1918
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:30,450
Again?

1919
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:31,070
Yeah.

1920
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,370
Last time I didn't...

1921
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:33,070
I got water.

1922
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:34,610
This time it's a bathroom emergency.

1923
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:35,410
Oh, okay, okay.

1924
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:43,790
Guys, this looks exactly like Metal Gear.

1925
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,370
It's the MGSV map.

1926
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,430
It really, really feels like that.

1927
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:50,810
It feels exactly like the Metal Gear map.

1928
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,210
Just the...

1929
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:52,730
The ho...

1930
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:53,150
The hall...

1931
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,230
I almost said hotel.

1932
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:57,770
The hospital hallways are just a little bit different, I think.

1933
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:00,230
But it's like almost exactly it.

1934
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,470
Call me Ishmael.

1935
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,450
It's literally the same hospital.

1936
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:09,530
I can't do this.

1937
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,750
All I see is Metal Gear.

1938
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:12,350
Even the stairway.

1939
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:15,110
Oh god.

1940
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:16,590
The crowd of dudes in the hallway.

1941
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:17,210
Oh my gosh!

1942
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:17,510
Yes!

1943
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:18,050
You're right!

1944
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,500
There's hospitals besides Metal Gear.

1945
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:23,840
No, no.

1946
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,960
You don't understand though.

1947
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,040
Like this specifically has too many parallels.

1948
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:30,380
This one...

1949
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,620
This specifically has way too many parallels.

1950
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,360
Like the way you wake up.

1951
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,260
It actually...

1952
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,680
It looks exactly like the room.

1953
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:40,880
I don't know.

1954
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,440
I'm not saying that it's the same map.

1955
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,560
But...

1956
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,420
I'm not saying it's the same map.

1957
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,000
But...

1958
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,080
The thighs look a lot like it.

1959
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,500
If only we got a gun.

1960
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,900
I'm afraid it's been...

1961
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,160
Nine years.

1962
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,540
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep!

1963
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,200
Oh yeah.

1964
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,900
I need my eye patch.

1965
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:15,400
There we go.

1966
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,220
Wait, did that work?

1967
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:18,920
Yeah.

1968
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,040
Okay.

1969
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,000
I'm tired.

1970
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:26,980
Sorry.

1971
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,740
It all comes back to Metal Gear.

1972
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,200
I want my pizza.

1973
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,440
I'll become...

1974
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:37,860
I'll be...

1975
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,620
I'll have more...

1976
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,760
More brain power once I eat.

1977
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,180
I...

1978
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,220
I got something today.

1979
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:45,840
And...

1980
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,380
Oh my gosh.

1981
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,960
You know what's so frustrating?

1982
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,240
Is when you order something.

1983
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,800
And you tell them no of something.

1984
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,780
And they include it.

1985
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:52,720
You know?

1986
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,100
And then you're just like...

1987
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,100
My meal...

1988
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:56,800
It's not ruined.

1989
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,820
I still ate it.

1990
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:58,960
But I ate it...

1991
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,800
With...

1992
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,280
With disdain.

1993
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,520
I was just like...

1994
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,640
Like I was so...

1995
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:07,920
Why'd you...

1996
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,660
Why didn't you...

1997
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,540
Why didn't you...

1998
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,440
Take it out?

1999
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:10,520
What?

2000
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:13,780
Hmm...

2001
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,000
So annoying.

2002
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,080
Oh, welcome back.

2003
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,320
What was so annoying?

2004
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,320
I ordered something.

2005
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,800
And I told them not to add something in it.

2006
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,640
And they still did.

2007
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:23,800
Wait, what was it?

2008
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,000
It was bean sprouts.

2009
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:26,660
Ew.

2010
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,400
Wait, you...

2011
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:27,600
What?

2012
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,840
What kind of pizza has bean sprouts on it?

2013
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,920
What kind of pizza did you order?

2014
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,060
It's not pizza.

2015
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:32,840
It was earlier.

2016
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:35,900
It was...

2017
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:36,060
Oh!

2018
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,160
And like with bean sprouts...

2019
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,020
It was bean sprouts.

2020
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:38,920
And then like...

2021
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,620
I don't like bean sprouts.

2022
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,920
So I had to like pick them out.

2023
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:42,600
But it's like...

2024
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,800
Individual bean sprouts.

2025
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,700
Yeah, so you have to like individually pick them up.

2026
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,860
Yeah, I do that with...

2027
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,120
Yeah.

2028
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:47,640
Pickles.

2029
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,580
And mushrooms.

2030
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,420
Oh yeah, I do that with mushrooms.

2031
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:50,960
Yeah, I don't...

2032
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,340
I don't like mushrooms either.

2033
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,160
It's like a type...

2034
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:53,420
It's like...

2035
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,260
I don't want to eat a fungus.

2036
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,120
Like you saw what happened in Last of Us.

2037
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:56,760
Like...

2038
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,780
What if this one mushroom I eat is that mutated mushroom?

2039
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,800
Yeah, I think about that with almonds.

2040
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:03,580
Oh my god.

2041
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:06,180
What about almonds?

2042
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:16,140
Because almonds, before they were catered to humans, they have arsenic in it.

2043
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:16,800
Wait, what?

2044
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,640
That's why arsenic smells like almonds.

2045
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,040
Why do you know what arsenic smells like?

2046
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,080
I've watched detective shows.

2047
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,600
That doesn't explain the smell.

2048
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,240
Oh, cyanide, cyanide, cyanide, cyanide.

2049
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,080
I haven't had my pizza.

2050
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,960
I was like, how do you know what cyanide smells like?

2051
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:41,580
Like, you just believe or detect like they're like, don't drink cyanide.

2052
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:42,900
It smells just like almonds.

2053
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:44,280
Don't drink cyanide.

2054
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,840
No, they'll let go and they'll be like this person.

2055
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,480
There's I smell.

2056
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,380
I smell almonds right now.

2057
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,440
Yeah, feel like it might be poison.

2058
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,000
It might be so.

2059
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:02,500
So if you eat a random food and it smells like almonds, You might be poisoned by cyanide.

2060
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,980
Or, second hypothesis, there's almonds in it.

2061
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,820
Or, yeah, and then you have a nut allergy.

2062
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:13,500
If you have a nut allergy, you either die by cyanide or die by almonds.

2063
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,320
Win-win, maybe.

2064
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,080
Win-win, yeah.

2065
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,060
So to avoid being poisoned, just have a nut allergy.

2066
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,340
So you can avoid all types of nuts.

2067
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,380
Oh, yeah.

2068
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:25,820
Yeah.

2069
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,820
Then you don't have any other problems in your life.

2070
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,380
Yeah, don't you have to get that.

2071
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,800
You only don't have to worry about...

2072
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,840
Yeah, you just have to worry.

2073
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,580
Just need to make sure you have an EpiPen near you at all times.

2074
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,980
Oh my god, the fountain is broken.

2075
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:42,660
No!

2076
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,240
Think of the water pill.

2077
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,160
That's the real horror.

2078
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,620
The real horror is the water pill.

2079
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,260
Not the water pill!

2080
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:51,960
No!

2081
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,800
Where am I supposed to go?

2082
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,200
It never told me where to go.

2083
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,520
Let's explore.

2084
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,520
Alright.

2085
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,740
There's so many wheelchairs here.

2086
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,920
There's nobody on it.

2087
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It's a hospital.

2088
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:03,480
A miracle happened.

2089
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:11,060
There's so many abandoned wheelchairs because everyone could just miraculously stand again.

2090
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,940
Yeah, everybody just started walking.

2091
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,320
A miracle occurred!

2092
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,480
Just like our shirtless guy.

2093
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,040
Yeah!

2094
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:17,660
Yeah!

2095
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:18,200
Yeah!

2096
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:18,260
Yeah!

2097
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,140
Oh my god, this is a miracle hospital.

2098
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,040
They all...

2099
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,240
Yeah.

2100
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,700
They cured walking.

2101
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,860
They're really doing wonders here.

2102
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,500
Yeah, yeah.

2103
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,040
Yeah.

2104
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,140
They're doing such a good job.

2105
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,240
That's why it's abandoned.

2106
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,500
They just fixed everybody.

2107
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,140
Yeah, nobody's sick anymore.

2108
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,180
Yeah, nobody's sick in this hospital.

2109
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,100
Orthopedic.

2110
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,440
I don't think I'm not supposed to be here.

2111
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,300
Like, this area...

2112
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,480
This level seems like...

2113
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:43,520
Very...

2114
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,480
Whistle raid.

2115
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,280
Very straightforward.

2116
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,560
Like, linear.

2117
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:47,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2118
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,260
This one's a more linear chapter.

2119
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,160
Yeah.

2120
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,040
Which is my favorite type of chapter.

2121
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:52,940
Oh, wait.

2122
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,400
How about go to the door that's...

2123
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,100
Yeah, covered in...

2124
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,560
Yeah, I thought about that too.

2125
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:57,800
Oh, wait, no.

2126
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,440
There's a hand here.

2127
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,180
Yeah, there we go.

2128
01:10:59,240 --> 01:10:59,280
Yeah.

2129
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,820
They're like, literally...

2130
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,580
Like, guiding me.

2131
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:05,000
School feeding you.

2132
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,980
God, that's my favorite type of game.

2133
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,140
Follow up of patient...

2134
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,820
On request from Smith Walter.

2135
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:11,820
Found her his tape.

2136
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:12,820
Oh, yeah.

2137
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,140
Also, does it sound a lot better now?

2138
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:14,860
I don't even know.

2139
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,480
Yeah, can you hear it, guys?

2140
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,040
Gender male, age 28.

2141
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,280
After Rakin's first evaluation...

2142
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,680
No, this is supposed to be a miracle hospital.

2143
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:24,960
What do you mean saying?

2144
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,480
You're supposed to fix everybody.

2145
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,800
Maybe he's like the one patient they never could fix.

2146
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,040
Yeah.

2147
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:37,700
Uh...

2148
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:38,640
Brainwash?

2149
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,300
Let's go.

2150
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,480
From getting to them.

2151
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,260
They're gonna get him.

2152
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,200
From...

2153
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,180
Getting to him.

2154
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,780
Getting to him.

2155
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:50,040
Adding to the severity of his case, he is sometimes afflicted with hallucinations.

2156
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,960
He has described these hallucinations...

2157
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,480
Eyeless humanoid that keeps on watch- Oh, it's them!

2158
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,480
Those little naked guys that we saw.

2159
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,480
The shirtless men.

2160
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,700
Yeah.

2161
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,220
If they're eyeless, how are they watching you, dumbass?

2162
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:03,800
Dumbass.

2163
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:04,620
Yeah.

2164
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,440
I wonder you're in the psychiatric ward.

2165
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:10,600
Not even your hallucinations make sense.

2166
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,520
They're so crazy.

2167
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,880
Your hallucinations don't even follow...

2168
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,400
The law.

2169
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,800
Violent behaviors towards staff?

2170
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,040
Oh, okay.

2171
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:24,760
Uh-oh.

2172
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:25,640
Oh, no.

2173
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:26,700
It's okay.

2174
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,220
I'm not...

2175
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,180
Okay, so like...

2176
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,940
Why is there math homework in my hospital?

2177
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,560
Like...

2178
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,260
Who's bringing their kid here to do their high school homework?

2179
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,060
Like...

2180
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:37,540
Ew!

2181
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,540
It's just, uh...

2182
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:40,720
Bring your kid to work then.

2183
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,360
Like, there's like...

2184
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,900
I see a fucking equation there.

2185
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:43,640
I see fractions.

2186
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,020
This is not science.

2187
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,720
I like that big...

2188
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,840
That man's, like, giant face in the newspaper.

2189
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:49,280
Oh, yeah.

2190
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:49,660
That guy?

2191
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,620
I like this painting.

2192
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,420
Yeah.

2193
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,720
The jester.

2194
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:54,980
The jester, yeah.

2195
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,800
Nah, it looks like you.

2196
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,500
All right.

2197
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:02,500
I guess we move out of this place now.

2198
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:04,320
All right.

2199
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:04,600
Oh, yeah.

2200
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,640
We have to bring the volume up a little bit.

2201
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:07,580
Okay.

2202
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,840
I brought it up a little bit, guys.

2203
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:11,860
Oh.

2204
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:12,660
Oops.

2205
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,140
I actually tabbed out my OBS.

2206
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:14,400
All right.

2207
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:14,780
There we go.

2208
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:15,740
All right.

2209
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,240
Where else do I go after fractions?

2210
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,780
Where's my yellow paint?

2211
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,700
Yellow paint.

2212
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,340
Yellow paint.

2213
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:24,320
Hello.

2214
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,380
We're a gamer here.

2215
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:26,220
Gamer here.

2216
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,140
Streamer here.

2217
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,080
We need yellow paint.

2218
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,680
That's more accurate.

2219
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:30,520
Streamer here.

2220
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,380
We need help.

2221
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,500
We need help.

2222
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,140
Paint the signs yellow.

2223
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:39,620
Oh.

2224
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,740
There's people there.

2225
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:42,980
There are?

2226
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:43,800
I don't know.

2227
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,340
There's the flashing light.

2228
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,860
Sorry, the quality is so low, I can't see it.

2229
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:53,420
Yeah, those ten missing pixels are fucking with me right now.

2230
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,520
Oh, here we go.

2231
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,080
Oh, here.

2232
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,840
Oh, there's another key.

2233
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,600
A key to...

2234
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,040
Basement.

2235
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,800
Okay, I actually don't know where the basement staircase is.

2236
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,660
I was not keeping track.

2237
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,600
What's he gonna do, clip through the wall like last time?

2238
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,160
He's not a ghost, he's a real person.

2239
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,380
Oh, I think that was...

2240
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,120
Oh, no, he's still there.

2241
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:17,260
Oh, he waited.

2242
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:17,880
Oh, hello.

2243
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:18,840
He waited!

2244
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,520
Was he gonna do, climb up this table?

2245
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,460
I think you can loop him, maybe.

2246
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:25,860
He can't reach me!

2247
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,240
Wait, he can't reach you!

2248
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:30,080
He can't come up through this table!

2249
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,980
That's right, I have the high ground!

2250
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,120
He's really trying.

2251
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,420
He's trying to kill me, guys.

2252
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,240
I don't know where to go.

2253
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,140
I think he really wants to kill me.

2254
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,400
Come on, mister!

2255
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,400
You...

2256
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:49,600
Just...

2257
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,400
Just come on!

2258
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:51,040
Just turn around!

2259
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:52,140
Turn around!

2260
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,300
What are you gonna do?

2261
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,340
That's right!

2262
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,700
Let me just...

2263
01:14:59,700 --> 01:14:59,860
Yep.

2264
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:01,120
Can you like...

2265
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:01,980
There you go, there you go.

2266
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:02,260
Oh!

2267
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:02,780
Oh!

2268
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:03,700
Oh!

2269
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,440
He's like sulking in the corner.

2270
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,680
I have the high ground now!

2271
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,880
I think you could just...

2272
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,380
Run.

2273
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,400
I think you could just run.

2274
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,700
What are you gonna do right here?

2275
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,280
Oh!

2276
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:23,500
Oh!

2277
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,660
He's gonna go back to the corner.

2278
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,240
He's gonna keep running!

2279
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,440
I just slowly opened the door.

2280
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,480
I didn't figure out how to open the door.

2281
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:35,960
Oh!

2282
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:36,480
What's he gonna do?

2283
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,180
He's gonna go back to the corner.

2284
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,400
He doesn't know what to do.

2285
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,840
He's so...

2286
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,180
I can't open the door!

2287
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,660
I can't get up!

2288
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,180
My high ground protects me!

2289
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,660
I can't accidentally close the door!

2290
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:58,620
He just waxed me.

2291
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,220
Oh wait, no he's gonna...

2292
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:00,920
I'm not gonna lie!

2293
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,440
We deserve that!

2294
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,420
Oh shit!

2295
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:04,920
We deserve that!

2296
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:05,860
Yeah, we did!

2297
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,220
We fucking deserve what we did to him!

2298
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:10,860
He...

2299
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:11,940
He mad!

2300
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,560
Okay, maybe you run past him.

2301
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,320
Yeah, maybe I should've...

2302
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,060
He's pretty fast though!

2303
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:20,660
He's like actually running past you!

2304
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,100
Yeah, he was like...

2305
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:21,800
Yeah, I was like...

2306
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,560
What's he gonna do?

2307
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,060
He's...

2308
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:24,140
He's crippled!

2309
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:25,240
Like...

2310
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:27,920
Oh shit!

2311
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,520
Oh, that scared me!

2312
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:32,140
That scared me more than...

2313
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,140
Okay, alright.

2314
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,740
Alright, let me feed him real quick.

2315
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,520
He's angry.

2316
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,700
He's upset at what you said!

2317
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,360
He's like, you can't say that!

2318
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,500
When's my feeding time, guys?

2319
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:46,420
Where's my pizza?

2320
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:47,620
I'm

2321
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:53,950
back to my desk!

2322
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,190
So you don't have to pause too long.

2323
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:57,210
Alright, okay.

2324
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:57,750
I'm back.

2325
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:58,530
Alright, so now we know I have to...

2326
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,550
I'm gonna go get a drink though.

2327
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:00,730
Okay, I'll run.

2328
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,190
While you do that.

2329
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:02,910
Okay, yeah, just run.

2330
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:04,910
Oh my god.

2331
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,870
He's like right next to me.

2332
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:07,150
Oh my god.

2333
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:08,290
He was right next...

2334
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,450
Okay, where's the basement though?

2335
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,090
Guys, where's the...

2336
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,150
That's the one thing I don't know.

2337
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,470
Okay, I'm outside.

2338
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,930
He was like right behind me.

2339
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:20,530
That's cheating.

2340
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:22,970
That's actually cheating.

2341
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:24,910
I should be safe now, right?

2342
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:26,450
Yeah.

2343
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:27,650
Okay, I'm okay now.

2344
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:29,710
That thing can get me now.

2345
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:31,470
I'm unstoppable.

2346
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:32,470
I beat...

2347
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:34,350
I beat a man on the...

2348
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:35,650
On those like crutches.

2349
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,530
I'm just that good.

2350
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,130
Now where do I go?

2351
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:42,150
To the other door.

2352
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:43,630
Hehehehe.

2353
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,610
He's on crutches.

2354
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,170
Yeah, and I beat him in a race.

2355
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:50,370
That's how good I am.

2356
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:53,710
Oh, fuck it!

2357
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:54,390
He's right behind me!

2358
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,390
Okay, but he's not that fast though.

2359
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,010
Like, look at him.

2360
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:57,750
He's on crutches.

2361
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:57,810
He's on crutches.

2362
01:17:58,290 --> 01:18:00,150
I can literally leisurely walk.

2363
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:00,730
Look at him.

2364
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:01,970
He's so slow.

2365
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:04,030
Did you lose him?

2366
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:05,090
No, he's like right here.

2367
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:05,970
Oh.

2368
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:13,370
He seems so fast in the office room.

2369
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,630
Oh my god, is this the...

2370
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:16,450
Okay, it is.

2371
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,390
Okay, I saw stairs.

2372
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:18,530
Ah, you got it!

2373
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:19,990
Okay.

2374
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,550
Yeah.

2375
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:22,010
He's right there.

2376
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:23,930
He's gonna pop out at you.

2377
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:24,490
Nah.

2378
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,310
He's gonna be like...

2379
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:25,410
Ooh!

2380
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,370
Wait, the light's gone.

2381
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,710
Maybe...

2382
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,490
Oh, maybe you're going back to the house.

2383
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:31,270
Oh, maybe.

2384
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,590
I'm having a vision right now.

2385
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:34,350
I can't move.

2386
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:34,750
Oh.

2387
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:35,910
What happened?

2388
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:36,490
What?

2389
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:38,250
Load times.

2390
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:39,170
Load times.

2391
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,070
What the fuck happened?

2392
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:43,690
The game is loading.

2393
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:46,010
They have to load me into the next...

2394
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:46,590
Oh, there is the flashlight.

2395
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:46,990
Oh, there is.

2396
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:47,350
Yeah.

2397
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:48,550
I was like, what do you mean?

2398
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:51,510
They're just like, we gotta load you to the next level.

2399
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,870
Just black out for a second.

2400
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:54,070
Yeah, yeah, black out.

2401
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,570
Just having a vision.

2402
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:01,430
Look at all these...

2403
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,470
No, it's saved.

2404
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:02,230
Nice.

2405
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:02,990
I don't have to save.

2406
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:04,010
Nope.

2407
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,510
Assume it's...

2408
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:06,650
Nope.

2409
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,510
First door that opens.

2410
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:11,550
Ooh.

2411
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,330
I need to fix it.

2412
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:13,210
It's a locker room.

2413
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:13,750
Weaking.

2414
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,090
I need to fix this hospital.

2415
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:18,030
Oh, nice.

2416
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:18,770
Control room.

2417
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:19,070
Control room.

2418
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:19,770
Okay.

2419
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:23,230
I just like how I don't have to manage pills right now.

2420
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:24,610
I know.

2421
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:25,390
I know.

2422
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:25,650
Yeah.

2423
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:26,330
That's the best part.

2424
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:27,830
That's like the best part about this game.

2425
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,070
What do I do?

2426
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:30,530
Wait.

2427
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:31,530
He won't let me pass.

2428
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:33,190
There's something here.

2429
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:34,630
Just jump.

2430
01:19:36,190 --> 01:19:37,210
Just that easy.

2431
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,030
Just jump.

2432
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:38,870
Just...

2433
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:39,850
Just use your legs.

2434
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:40,930
Okay.

2435
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:41,890
That's insensitive.

2436
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:43,230
There's people here that can't walk.

2437
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:44,730
I can't just use my legs like that.

2438
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:46,910
What if we're actually in the wheelchair then?

2439
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,170
What if we're like...

2440
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:49,370
We're slowly rolling around.

2441
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:52,090
We're just like, please, won't somebody help us?

2442
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,630
Is this the controller?

2443
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:55,150
Oh, wait.

2444
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,810
Oh, this is a room that was blocked by the locker.

2445
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:59,270
Oh.

2446
01:19:59,710 --> 01:19:59,910
Yeah.

2447
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,270
Oh, wait.

2448
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:00,990
No, that's not...

2449
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:01,470
No, JK.

2450
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:03,870
I was just making stuff up and you were still agreeing.

2451
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:05,730
Yeah.

2452
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,730
I did agree.

2453
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:07,530
You're a sheep.

2454
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,610
You don't think for yourself.

2455
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:09,990
You're a sheep.

2456
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:10,830
I really didn't.

2457
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,530
I didn't think for myself at all.

2458
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:14,150
I just said, yeah, you're okay.

2459
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:14,650
You're right.

2460
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:15,490
Yeah, you're so right.

2461
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:16,110
What is this layout?

2462
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,170
I don't know.

2463
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:17,850
I don't even...

2464
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:19,130
I think this is the control room.

2465
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:19,970
Yeah?

2466
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,170
It sounds like it.

2467
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:24,270
No, that's just the laundry.

2468
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:25,330
It's the laundry room.

2469
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:29,530
What laundry are they doing in here?

2470
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:30,850
Wait, this is the only one that's on.

2471
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:33,490
They won't open.

2472
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:34,850
Until the cycle's done?

2473
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:36,090
This is too...

2474
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:37,770
This is too realistic.

2475
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:41,790
I can open a washing machine whenever I want.

2476
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:42,810
Yeah.

2477
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:44,570
And you don't control me.

2478
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:46,370
You're just...

2479
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:48,190
Like, you know how when it's like five minutes or...

2480
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:49,190
Until it's done and you're just...

2481
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:50,570
You just can't wait that five minutes?

2482
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:52,550
It's pretty much done.

2483
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:53,510
Yeah, it's pretty much...

2484
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:53,770
That's...

2485
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,170
What's that five minutes gonna do?

2486
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:58,310
If it's dry...

2487
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:59,030
Well, I guess...

2488
01:20:59,030 --> 01:20:59,090
Oh.

2489
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:00,790
It's not that.

2490
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:03,370
What is the control room?

2491
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:04,310
What controls it?

2492
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,710
We actually just have to wait until...

2493
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:09,590
It says we have to manually shut...

2494
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:10,770
I think we have to manually shut...

2495
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:11,470
Oh, is it this one?

2496
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,790
No.

2497
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:12,790
No, it's jammed.

2498
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,110
I saw like a pirate thing on there, so I assumed it was...

2499
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,050
A pirate?

2500
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,330
Oh!

2501
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:18,530
Oh!

2502
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:19,310
Is it here?

2503
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:21,130
Oh, it's here!

2504
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:22,710
Okay.

2505
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:24,510
Ew, I don't like that.

2506
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:26,710
Ew, what the hell?

2507
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:26,970
I don't like it.

2508
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,370
This is gross.

2509
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:30,990
This is what peop...

2510
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:31,890
This is what like...

2511
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,770
People who go to trade school have to do.

2512
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,410
The air conditioning man.

2513
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:38,570
Haley Joel Osment got arrested.

2514
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:39,970
You can't scare me anymore.

2515
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:41,150
Wait, he got arrested?

2516
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,090
What did he do?

2517
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:45,370
It's apparently public intoxication.

2518
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:49,630
Let me join him.

2519
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,370
We'll see Doki Bird on the news tomorrow.

2520
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,010
Okay, but like...

2521
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,850
How would you know he was public...

2522
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,050
Publicly intoxicated?

2523
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:05,270
I think he would know.

2524
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,250
It could just be like...

2525
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,830
You know, celebrity things, you know?

2526
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:11,570
Just like he's really eccentric.

2527
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2528
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:14,750
He's just a very eccentric celebrity.

2529
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:15,490
You don't know that.

2530
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:15,830
Yeah.

2531
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:19,310
What the fuck is the power?

2532
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:19,930
Oh.

2533
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:23,630
It's not the one...

2534
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:24,730
It's not the key though.

2535
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:26,030
It wasn't?

2536
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:26,790
But it was not.

2537
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:27,890
I still have my key, see?

2538
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:29,130
Oh, it's like...

2539
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:30,390
Oh, it was from the other side.

2540
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:31,610
I just unlocked it the other way.

2541
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,810
It's like...

2542
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:34,550
It's like the shortcut.

2543
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:35,590
I'm playing Dark Souls.

2544
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:38,190
I have a short...

2545
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,050
I unlocked the shortcut.

2546
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,110
Nice.

2547
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,530
Which means I have to come back here.

2548
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:46,370
Okay, is it here?

2549
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:48,130
There's so many rooms you can't go in.

2550
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:48,410
I know.

2551
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:49,370
I'm like so confused.

2552
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:49,930
Oh, it's here.

2553
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:51,370
Ah, haha.

2554
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:52,210
It wasn't even labeled.

2555
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,550
How was I supposed to know?

2556
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,370
You just explore.

2557
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:55,790
Oh.

2558
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:57,430
Oh, there he is.

2559
01:22:59,010 --> 01:22:59,410
Hello?

2560
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:00,570
We're gonna start walking?

2561
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:03,230
Hello?

2562
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:04,450
What is he gonna do?

2563
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:05,870
Why is he just standing there?

2564
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:06,010
Hey.

2565
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:07,410
Hey.

2566
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:08,090
That's his thing.

2567
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:08,650
Oh, he's gone.

2568
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:09,230
That's what he's into.

2569
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:10,490
He's just...

2570
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:11,990
Into just standing in the corner.

2571
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:15,370
Yeah, he wants to look really menacing and cool.

2572
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:16,530
Okay, he doesn't know.

2573
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:17,930
He's probably on his way over here, actually.

2574
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,650
I think so, too.

2575
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:19,990
I think that's why he's just gone.

2576
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:21,850
Alright.

2577
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:24,050
I'm in the power room.

2578
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:25,330
Hello?

2579
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:26,550
Crutch guy?

2580
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,190
I don't think there should be water.

2581
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:29,170
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2582
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,410
In the power room?

2583
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:31,910
Like...

2584
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:34,510
Oh, I turned off the washing machine.

2585
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:35,490
Yeah, yeah.

2586
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:35,970
Alright.

2587
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:37,790
Time to wear some wet clothes.

2588
01:23:38,910 --> 01:23:39,750
My favorite.

2589
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,410
Love that wet clothes.

2590
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:44,710
Is he still in there?

2591
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:45,130
No, he's not.

2592
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:47,130
He's taking it!

2593
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:47,570
Oh, my God!

2594
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:47,950
What is he?

2595
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,030
Guys, I don't think he's in there anymore.

2596
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:58,090
That person tried to wear a shirt.

2597
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,450
Rejected from the coat.

2598
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,550
He was trying to get a shirt there.

2599
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:04,510
No, I think you go back through the shortcut.

2600
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:07,450
The washing machine was here.

2601
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:08,790
Oh, was it?

2602
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:09,710
Was it not here?

2603
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:10,630
Or was it a shortcut?

2604
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:11,530
Yeah, was it?

2605
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:12,150
I don't remember.

2606
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:13,890
You probably remember best!

2607
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:14,490
No, I don't.

2608
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:15,270
I'm so...

2609
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:16,750
I'm so...

2610
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:17,010
Oh, wait.

2611
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:17,490
Okay, you're right.

2612
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:18,450
That's what the shortcut's for.

2613
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:20,650
Yep.

2614
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:21,590
I am right.

2615
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:23,730
No, I was talking to chat.

2616
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:30,010
It was here, right?

2617
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:31,130
Yeah, uh...

2618
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:33,110
Yeah?

2619
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:34,630
No, it was...

2620
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:35,390
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2621
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:36,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2622
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:38,670
Yeah, because we were like, what the fuck?

2623
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:39,570
Who made this layout?

2624
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:40,910
Why is the layout like this?

2625
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:41,970
Why is it like...

2626
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:43,070
It's just like the house.

2627
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:44,090
The person...

2628
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:44,550
Yeah, yeah, like...

2629
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:45,770
So the ghost won't get you.

2630
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:47,570
The architect is the same architect.

2631
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:48,490
Oh, it's the key!

2632
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:49,730
What's his name?

2633
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:50,570
I think that's his body.

2634
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:51,930
Kyle Schaffner.

2635
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:52,470
Janitor.

2636
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:52,990
Full-time.

2637
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:54,470
Hi, Kyle.

2638
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:56,130
Born in 1978.

2639
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:57,910
You think he's actually six feet?

2640
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:00,870
I think he like fibbed it a little bit.

2641
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:01,830
For his...

2642
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:02,430
For his...

2643
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,310
Yeah, just to be like, yeah, I'm a janitor.

2644
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:05,310
I'm six foot eight.

2645
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:06,110
Yeah.

2646
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:07,330
Okay, I don't know.

2647
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:09,750
I don't remember where this card unlocks, by the way.

2648
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:12,570
There was a door that required a card key.

2649
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:13,030
Oh, yeah.

2650
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,630
And I don't remember.

2651
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:17,570
I've already like forgotten 80% of this layout.

2652
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,430
This layout is kind of whack.

2653
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:20,270
Yeah.

2654
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:21,310
Um...

2655
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:23,110
It should be like around here, right?

2656
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:25,770
Yes?

2657
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:28,830
Hello?

2658
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:30,870
Go back through the shortcut.

2659
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:32,430
Door with card key?

2660
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:34,070
Where are you?

2661
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,690
Door with card key.

2662
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:37,790
It's probably lit up.

2663
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:39,370
It probably has like a little light on it.

2664
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:40,150
Like...

2665
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:40,230
Yeah.

2666
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:40,910
Yellow paint.

2667
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:42,790
I demand my yellow paint.

2668
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:43,850
Yellow paint.

2669
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:44,990
Where are you?

2670
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:46,410
Oh, it's this one.

2671
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:47,430
It's this door, right?

2672
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:48,530
I'm pretty sure.

2673
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:48,990
I don't...

2674
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:50,110
Are you sure?

2675
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:50,750
Yeah.

2676
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:51,050
Yeah.

2677
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:52,130
It's totally...

2678
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:52,370
Nope.

2679
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:53,110
That's where we were.

2680
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,310
That's the controller room.

2681
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:55,790
Huh?

2682
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,230
So lost.

2683
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:00,530
Uh...

2684
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,790
Uh...

2685
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:03,490
Uh...

2686
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:04,870
At least we don't have to keep up our sanity.

2687
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:06,310
Yeah.

2688
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:07,150
Oh, there it is!

2689
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,870
Yeah!

2690
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:09,510
Yeah!

2691
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:10,870
We're so smart!

2692
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:13,150
We got it!

2693
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:13,870
Oh!

2694
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:13,950
Oh!

2695
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:15,170
Hey guys!

2696
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:16,290
We're sh...

2697
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:16,450
Oh!

2698
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:17,150
Do you have to move them?

2699
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:18,630
Oh!

2700
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:19,230
Wait, no.

2701
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:20,390
He's moving by himself.

2702
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:21,550
Oh.

2703
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:22,610
Wait, no.

2704
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:23,030
I'm moving.

2705
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:23,450
Interact.

2706
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:23,890
Yeah.

2707
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:25,230
I think you're moving them out.

2708
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:26,310
You're just...

2709
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:27,410
Hello.

2710
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:28,490
Oh.

2711
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:29,290
Wait, what's happening?

2712
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:30,050
Oh!

2713
01:26:31,870 --> 01:26:32,450
You see?

2714
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:34,290
I don't think he likes that touch them.

2715
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:37,150
I don't think he likes that touch them.

2716
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:41,310
And then you have to go and like move them and then...

2717
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:43,610
He's like, why did you touch my collection?

2718
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:47,850
I thought the elevator's probably too heavy with them in there.

2719
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:48,410
It won't move.

2720
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:49,290
Oh, that's true.

2721
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:49,910
Okay.

2722
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,910
I moved one guy.

2723
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:51,930
That should be enough, right?

2724
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:55,250
Wait.

2725
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:55,850
Um.

2726
01:26:56,730 --> 01:26:57,290
Um.

2727
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:59,390
It sounds kind of creaky.

2728
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:01,310
You're like...

2729
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:02,330
I can hear...

2730
01:27:02,910 --> 01:27:04,410
I don't know where he is!

2731
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:06,030
Crouch man!

2732
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,990
I'm trying to move him!

2733
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:09,770
You can literally hear him coming!

2734
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:12,290
I'm scared.

2735
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:13,690
I think he's gone.

2736
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,090
Wait, is he just gone?

2737
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:18,410
Is he just gone?

2738
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:19,430
Like, just like that?

2739
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:20,450
Like, I moved...

2740
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:20,530
Maybe.

2741
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:22,230
I touched his things and he doesn't care anymore?

2742
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:23,650
Maybe.

2743
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:23,950
Alright, let's...

2744
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:24,530
That might be him.

2745
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:27,790
I think you gotta get all the bodies out.

2746
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:28,470
What?!

2747
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:29,790
They're not that heavy!

2748
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:32,170
Alright.

2749
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:33,170
Game logic.

2750
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:34,990
They're not that heavy!

2751
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:37,050
Were they like 10 tons each person?

2752
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:37,710
You better hurry up!

2753
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:38,270
He's coming!

2754
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:39,030
He's coming!

2755
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:39,890
No, he's not.

2756
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:40,470
You're dying.

2757
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,330
You better hurry up!

2758
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:44,830
He's on his way!

2759
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:45,810
I'm fucking paranoid right now.

2760
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,110
Oh my god, I'm creating a scene.

2761
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,930
He's almost there!

2762
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:49,510
What is this?

2763
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:51,110
I'm creating...

2764
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:54,170
This is somebody's fantasy right now.

2765
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:55,910
It's mine.

2766
01:27:58,870 --> 01:28:01,390
Oh my god, that guy's already excited.

2767
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:02,570
Whoa, you see that?

2768
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:04,670
I think I heard him.

2769
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:05,850
He's whistling.

2770
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:07,210
He's on his way.

2771
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:07,810
He's like...

2772
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:09,810
Here I come!

2773
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:16,050
One, two, naked man's coming for you.

2774
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:19,790
Alright, that guy.

2775
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:20,190
Can I keep...

2776
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:22,410
Can I just keep one of them with me?

2777
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:24,630
No, they gotta go home.

2778
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:26,910
They're not yours.

2779
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,390
They're not yours to keep.

2780
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:29,890
Oh, I hear him.

2781
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:31,170
Oh, you gotta...

2782
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:31,870
I think you should go.

2783
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,470
I should keep this in hand.

2784
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:35,070
Wait, what does that mean?

2785
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:35,950
The fuck this...

2786
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:36,990
What's the English is that?

2787
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,150
What does that mean?

2788
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:39,790
I should keep this in hands here?

2789
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:40,250
What?

2790
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:43,930
Did he get lost?

2791
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:45,050
Don't worry, same.

2792
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:48,690
Like, I got lost in the circular hallway.

2793
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,890
Yeah, he's like...

2794
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:53,930
He was like, was it this turn or that turn?

2795
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:54,950
Where are we?

2796
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:57,270
Where are we in my personal health?

2797
01:28:59,370 --> 01:28:59,750
Uh...

2798
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,870
Uh...

2799
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:00,210
Whoa!

2800
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:00,690
Oh!

2801
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:02,570
Okay.

2802
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,750
There's a lot more women here.

2803
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,710
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2804
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:09,410
Ooh, all the ladies here there.

2805
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:10,730
Ooh.

2806
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:12,450
Ooh.

2807
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:14,030
Oh my gosh.

2808
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,890
Can you imagine if they were, like, weeping angels?

2809
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:16,850
Oh, that's that.

2810
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:17,710
No, I...

2811
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:19,050
Oh, you played M-side yet, right?

2812
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,250
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2813
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:22,490
Yeah, that area with the weeping.

2814
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:22,890
Oh my...

2815
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:23,470
I hated that.

2816
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:24,530
Hated that.

2817
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:26,490
Wait, is he gonna kill me?

2818
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:27,870
Fuck you, Dwayne.

2819
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:31,210
I think he's just lining up.

2820
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:32,290
Oh, no.

2821
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:36,510
Why didn't you move?

2822
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:37,450
I was!

2823
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:38,730
I was moving backwards!

2824
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:40,970
Why didn't you move out of the way?

2825
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,350
I was curious!

2826
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:45,470
I was curious if they...

2827
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:48,850
If they just, you know, walked to the side or something.

2828
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:50,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2829
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:53,110
I thought he was gonna, like, you're like, out of the way!

2830
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:54,850
Like, on your left, you know?

2831
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:58,110
Uh, yeah, you thought he was just gonna, like...

2832
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:59,930
I gave him the left side!

2833
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:02,710
The hallway was big enough for two of us!

2834
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:03,570
I...

2835
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:07,910
Alright, here we go again.

2836
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,450
Am I crouched yet?

2837
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:09,930
No, okay.

2838
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:12,690
My god, he has, like, bruises everywhere.

2839
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:14,590
Like, where do I go?

2840
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:15,950
I couldn't tell.

2841
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:18,550
I thought it was, like, purple paint or something on there.

2842
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:19,870
Like...

2843
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:20,510
Can you save?

2844
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:23,250
Oh, I have to go this way.

2845
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:24,990
Fuck you, Dwayne.

2846
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:26,330
Fuck you, Dwayne?

2847
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:27,090
Who's Dwayne?

2848
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:28,070
I'm Doki.

2849
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:28,610
The rock!

2850
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:29,550
Oh,

2851
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:33,250
I heard something.

2852
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:35,550
Something's crackling.

2853
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:37,870
How about just close this door?

2854
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:39,550
There we go.

2855
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:40,110
We'll wait for you.

2856
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,070
I just closed this door.

2857
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:42,870
What's he gonna do?

2858
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:43,870
Open it?

2859
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:46,890
Alright.

2860
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:47,970
Okay.

2861
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:49,450
If you hide under there.

2862
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:51,030
Is that who he's paranoid about?

2863
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:51,710
Dwayne?

2864
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:52,470
The rock Johnson?

2865
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,130
He's just...

2866
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:55,190
He's just everywhere, you know?

2867
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:55,610
I'd be...

2868
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:57,670
Everyone has their celebrity nemesis.

2869
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:58,330
Do you have one?

2870
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:02,390
Can't think of one on top of my head.

2871
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:03,390
Who's your celebrity?

2872
01:31:03,610 --> 01:31:03,930
Is it...

2873
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:06,610
Is it Haley Joel Osment or whatever?

2874
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:08,330
Yeah, mine is Haley Joel Osment.

2875
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:09,250
Wait, why?

2876
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:10,430
What did he do to you?

2877
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:13,070
I don't like how his face looks.

2878
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:14,170
What?

2879
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:15,010
Like a child?

2880
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:16,310
That didn't grow up?

2881
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:19,650
Yeah, like his face does not fit his head.

2882
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:22,310
Like his face is so small and his head is so big.

2883
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,410
You've been like...

2884
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:27,190
You've been analyzing this man's face for a while.

2885
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:31,390
That's why he's my celebrity nemesis.

2886
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:34,270
I feel like...

2887
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:35,330
Like he's just...

2888
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:36,550
Wait, where do I go?

2889
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:38,430
Oh, look, look, look!

2890
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:39,030
There's another...

2891
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,750
There's another TV.

2892
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:41,110
Exit, exit, exit.

2893
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:42,410
I can't open this.

2894
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:44,610
Well, you went to the wrong way then.

2895
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:45,970
You messed up.

2896
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:48,670
Oh, there's so many doors.

2897
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:50,330
No!

2898
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:55,470
Wait, that's not fair.

2899
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:56,370
She went through the door.

2900
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,010
Wait, she can do that?

2901
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:59,210
Uh-oh.

2902
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:01,610
Uh, get on top of like a...

2903
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:03,130
Desk like before.

2904
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:04,710
Um...

2905
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:05,710
You think she knows I'm here?

2906
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:06,670
Yeah.

2907
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,450
You think she...

2908
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:10,670
Run!

2909
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:11,570
Yay!

2910
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:16,430
A perfectly executed loop?

2911
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:21,850
I didn't even know there was a loop there.

2912
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:22,530
Not gonna lie.

2913
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:24,010
I didn't...

2914
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:24,250
I didn't either.

2915
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:26,590
Oh wait, follow the footsteps.

2916
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:27,230
Follow the footprints.

2917
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:27,690
Follow the footprints.

2918
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:28,390
Wait, they disappeared.

2919
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:29,310
A miracle happened again.

2920
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:34,110
They're telling you to go find the exit, exit, exit window.

2921
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:35,570
Where is the exit window?

2922
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:37,650
Oh, just keep going.

2923
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:38,070
I'm blind!

2924
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:39,610
No!

2925
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:41,010
No, I don't think you are!

2926
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:42,090
There, there, there, there!

2927
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:44,230
She's just standing there.

2928
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:45,470
She's blocking the exit.

2929
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:46,030
That's cheating.

2930
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:48,370
Uh oh.

2931
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:53,010
I can't open doors.

2932
01:32:53,330 --> 01:32:53,790
Oh my god.

2933
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:54,090
Oh my god.

2934
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:54,210
Oh my god.

2935
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:54,630
She's coming.

2936
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:55,230
Oh my god.

2937
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:55,950
Here we go.

2938
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:58,330
She can't open doors either.

2939
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:00,150
She just leaves.

2940
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:01,710
Yeah, she's kinda stupid.

2941
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:04,230
I think you gotta loop around her though.

2942
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:06,770
I think you gotta bait her over here and then loop around.

2943
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:07,290
Right?

2944
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:08,630
I don't think I can loop this way.

2945
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:11,490
Oh, oops.

2946
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:12,110
Oh god.

2947
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:13,590
Oh, oh.

2948
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:15,350
Oh, she looked herself!

2949
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:17,510
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

2950
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:17,870
Nice.

2951
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:18,910
Nice.

2952
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:20,050
I'm so smart.

2953
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,870
On me, baby.

2954
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:28,370
Dude, look at myself in the mirror.

2955
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:29,950
I'm a vampire.

2956
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:32,130
This is Metal Gear!

2957
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:37,430
Wait, I'm in here.

2958
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:38,530
What do I do in here?

2959
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:39,650
Everything's jammed.

2960
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:40,290
You...

2961
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,410
You tricked yourself.

2962
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:42,390
You're now the patient.

2963
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:43,790
Get back.

2964
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:44,130
Oh!

2965
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,330
Oh my god.

2966
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:47,090
Punch the mirror!

2967
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:47,810
Punch the mirror!

2968
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,350
Punch the mirror!

2969
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:50,310
They're always watching me.

2970
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:53,190
Oh,

2971
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:00,690
I think if I look away, the more I show up.

2972
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:02,610
Yeah, see?

2973
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:04,130
Actually, I lied.

2974
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:06,430
Try and...

2975
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:06,710
Try and leave.

2976
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:07,430
Maybe the door?

2977
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:08,430
Oh, never mind.

2978
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:09,550
Oh, my light's just...

2979
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:10,970
Hello.

2980
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,570
Welcome to the no shirt game.

2981
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:15,430
My god, it's a koala.

2982
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:17,050
Why is it like 5 FPS?

2983
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:23,690
It's like 5 FPS for me.

2984
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:28,410
It's the no shirt initiation.

2985
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:29,390
Yeah, right there.

2986
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:29,910
Woo!

2987
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:30,450
Woo!

2988
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,130
No shirts!

2989
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:31,850
No tie!

2990
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:32,690
All service!

2991
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:33,670
Yeah!

2992
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:37,130
Hello?

2993
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:38,230
It's loading.

2994
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:39,590
It's loading to the next level.

2995
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:40,950
Early access, guys.

2996
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:42,130
Early access!

2997
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:42,830
It's the best!

2998
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:45,410
Oh.

2999
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:48,290
Hello?

3000
01:34:48,430 --> 01:34:48,650
Hello?

3001
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:50,090
Hello?

3002
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:51,430
I hear something.

3003
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:52,190
Maybe try moving.

3004
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:53,990
I am moving.

3005
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:56,830
It's just a black screen for me.

3006
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:58,230
Me too.

3007
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:00,550
Wait.

3008
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:00,810
Oh!

3009
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:01,730
Oh.

3010
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:03,050
Oh, yeah, try.

3011
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:03,910
Oh!

3012
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:04,970
Oh!

3013
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:07,110
You're back in the house.

3014
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:08,010
I'm back.

3015
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:08,350
No.

3016
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:12,570
Welcome home.

3017
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:13,690
Wait, where's my pills?

3018
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:16,090
I don't think you had any.

3019
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:16,670
Wait.

3020
01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:17,710
Oh, no.

3021
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:18,970
You didn't have any pills.

3022
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:19,750
No.

3023
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:20,990
That's not good.

3024
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:22,830
That's not good.

3025
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:24,470
I need my pills.

3026
01:35:26,850 --> 01:35:27,470
Oh, no.

3027
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:29,510
Just keep following the...

3028
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:30,550
the vein.

3029
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:32,950
I'm following the veins?

3030
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:36,250
I don't like how I don't have my pills.

3031
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,510
I don't like that.

3032
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:40,970
There's these up here.

3033
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:41,330
I don't think you ever had them.

3034
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:42,910
All this way.

3035
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:45,030
Surprise it!

3036
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:47,090
Oh!

3037
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:47,430
Oh!

3038
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:48,530
Oh!

3039
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:51,850
I'm jumping!

3040
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:52,330
I'm jumping!

3041
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:52,830
Get me out!

3042
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:53,290
Get me out!

3043
01:35:56,410 --> 01:35:57,110
Oh my god.

3044
01:35:57,390 --> 01:35:58,250
Where's the painting?

3045
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:59,190
You can still come down the stairs.

3046
01:35:59,470 --> 01:36:00,350
But that's illegal.

3047
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:02,730
Where is he?

3048
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:03,250
Where is he?

3049
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:04,870
Yeah, I was gonna say, where did he go?

3050
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:07,990
Um...

3051
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,490
Um...

3052
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:10,790
Um...

3053
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:12,550
Oh, I have to find the eyes again.

3054
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:13,690
I have to find the eyes again.

3055
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:15,890
But he's chasing you at the same time.

3056
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:16,490
Oh!

3057
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:17,350
I don't know.

3058
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:18,450
We're painting with eyes.

3059
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:19,710
Painting with eyes!

3060
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:21,230
Does it change every time?

3061
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:21,590
Oh!

3062
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:22,610
There's painting with eyes!

3063
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:25,730
You passed one earlier while he was chasing you.

3064
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:26,390
Really?

3065
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:27,470
I was too freaked out.

3066
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:31,110
I think you tried hitting it, but it didn't...

3067
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:31,770
It didn't grab it.

3068
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:33,370
Okay.

3069
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,650
I don't know where he went.

3070
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:36,350
He's just gone.

3071
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:37,370
He was upstairs and he went to the left.

3072
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,930
He's just gone.

3073
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:41,010
It might have been like...

3074
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:41,770
Just, you know...

3075
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:42,770
There's two?!

3076
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:44,930
Oh, that's what it was!

3077
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:45,930
Oh, okay, okay.

3078
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:47,150
Oh, fuck.

3079
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:47,790
There's two.

3080
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:48,690
Weeeee!

3081
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:51,810
You, like, slide down the nasty...

3082
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:53,570
...veiny...

3083
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:53,790
Weeeee!

3084
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:55,150
It's like a little ride.

3085
01:36:56,910 --> 01:36:57,930
I'm gonna check over here.

3086
01:36:58,350 --> 01:36:59,550
I have to find another paint.

3087
01:36:59,850 --> 01:36:59,870
I have to find another paint.

3088
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:01,950
No, I'm checking the black veins.

3089
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,510
There's none here.

3090
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:05,890
There's one more I'm missing.

3091
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:06,730
No.

3092
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:10,150
Something popped outside.

3093
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:13,290
Something, like, popped outside right here.

3094
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:16,030
Oh, no.

3095
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:16,590
Okay.

3096
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:18,770
This is my only lighter, by the way.

3097
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:21,610
I think you'll be fine.

3098
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:22,930
I don't feel okay.

3099
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:23,910
I don't feel okay.

3100
01:37:24,010 --> 01:37:24,810
I don't feel okay.

3101
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:24,910
I don't feel okay.

3102
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:26,790
I don't know where the last painting is.

3103
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:27,650
Oh.

3104
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:29,290
Oh.

3105
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:32,590
I can't tell if you're zooming around everywhere.

3106
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:34,090
Yeah, these are gamer eyes.

3107
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,210
I can register.

3108
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:35,890
Game rush is scanning.

3109
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:36,890
Yeah, I'm scanning.

3110
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:37,870
Oh, yeah, you should turn your little...

3111
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:39,630
Your little game eye thing on.

3112
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:40,510
Just for that moment.

3113
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:41,290
Wait, there's none.

3114
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:41,990
I don't find it.

3115
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:44,050
I literally scan everything.

3116
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:45,990
Did she go...

3117
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:47,030
Go upstairs, yeah.

3118
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:48,010
It's upstairs?

3119
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:50,310
Oh, there's more here.

3120
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:51,370
Yeah.

3121
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:53,950
Oh, the hidden eyes.

3122
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:55,830
No, it's not hidden.

3123
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,110
You should stop.

3124
01:37:58,010 --> 01:37:59,990
I just never explored.

3125
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:01,490
She just never looked.

3126
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:02,650
Oh, there it is.

3127
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:03,990
AKA hidden.

3128
01:38:05,490 --> 01:38:06,790
It's so hidden.

3129
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:09,150
I just...

3130
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:11,950
I'm a little worried that I do only have one lighter left.

3131
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:13,290
And I did...

3132
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:13,510
Who would have thought?

3133
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:16,210
And I did use it this entire time.

3134
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:17,670
Wait, what?

3135
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:18,970
I have to find a key?

3136
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:23,650
Um...

3137
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:25,470
I didn't know where the key is.

3138
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:26,650
Where the fuck is it?

3139
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:27,270
Check the sink.

3140
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:29,530
What do you mean there's a key?

3141
01:38:29,530 --> 01:38:31,650
Oh, now the room is so clean.

3142
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:32,690
Oh, they're probably in here.

3143
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:34,430
Oh, there's another eye.

3144
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:35,270
There's another eye.

3145
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:37,290
Wait, how many eyes are there?

3146
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:38,490
Check the door now.

3147
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:39,350
That might have been the key.

3148
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:40,410
Yeah, that might have been the key.

3149
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:41,630
Oh.

3150
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,430
Oh, it's another wheelchair.

3151
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:44,990
Another miracle is gonna happen.

3152
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:45,010
Yay!

3153
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:45,770
Back to the hospital.

3154
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:46,450
Yay!

3155
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:47,870
Back to my safe place.

3156
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:48,870
The hospital.

3157
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:50,310
Yay!

3158
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:50,910
Oh, pizza here.

3159
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:51,270
Okay.

3160
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:52,370
Pizza here.

3161
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,100
Yay!

3162
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,340
Nothing bad ever happens in the hospital.

3163
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,240
Where people die.

3164
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:05,060
Yippee!

3165
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,160
It's okay.

3166
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:10,020
I have my friends and family here with me.

3167
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:17,840
You think this is a good operation?

3168
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:20,380
You think they are friends?

3169
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:21,860
They look friend-shaped.

3170
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:28,480
No eyes means I can't disappoint them.

3171
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:34,500
Yay!

3172
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,220
Flashbang!

3173
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:38,340
I am a little worried that I don't have any pills.

3174
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,580
I am...

3175
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:41,480
That is the most concerning thing for me.

3176
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:42,500
Or lighters.

3177
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,220
All I have is two flash bulbs.

3178
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:49,920
I feel like I can trust them.

3179
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,180
If they have no eyes, they can't judge me.

3180
01:39:56,220 --> 01:40:00,120
Okay, if the only issue is that they'll take my shirt, like, that's fine.

3181
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,020
That's okay.

3182
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,440
If it's just that shirt, like, that's fine.

3183
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,300
That's the sacrifice I'm willing to make.

3184
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:13,370
What are you doing now?

3185
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:15,090
Hello?

3186
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:16,190
I'm back here.

3187
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:18,310
Hello?

3188
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:22,630
Oh, the door is blocking.

3189
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:25,150
Oh, I'm back in the hospital.

3190
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:26,390
Wait, there's a...

3191
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,850
It's dark, man.

3192
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:29,610
Oh, he's pointing.

3193
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:30,910
He's pointing to me.

3194
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:32,130
To the exit.

3195
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:33,310
Not to you.

3196
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:34,530
He's pointing...

3197
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:36,570
He's taking me to the exit.

3198
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:37,770
I knew he was trustworthy.

3199
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:41,330
I knew a guy in all black can be trusted.

3200
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:45,090
All right.

3201
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:45,530
All right.

3202
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:45,910
It's like he...

3203
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:47,090
Oh, no, he's just taking me to the exit.

3204
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:47,770
He's telling you...

3205
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:50,150
He's like, this is what...

3206
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,010
You don't have your pills.

3207
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:55,330
You didn't take your meds.

3208
01:40:55,970 --> 01:40:58,090
It's time to go to the crazy ward.

3209
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:00,470
You think he's trying to say I'm crazy?

3210
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:05,130
No.

3211
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:05,970
No.

3212
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:07,050
I think you're fine.

3213
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:08,250
Yeah, I think I'm okay.

3214
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:09,350
I'll follow the red.

3215
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:09,610
Yeah.

3216
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:11,710
Follow the red paint.

3217
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:13,650
Wait.

3218
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:14,830
The red paint stopped.

3219
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:18,110
Oh, the red paint was just exit.

3220
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,010
Maybe I wasn't supposed to follow it.

3221
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:22,150
Wait, unless...

3222
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,350
But there's a door that needs a key, so...

3223
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:24,630
Oh!

3224
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,490
The fifth floor.

3225
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:29,610
Oh!

3226
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:30,910
There's math homework again.

3227
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:31,330
You just let him out.

3228
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:32,770
You just let that guy out.

3229
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:34,250
Oh, let's just let the crazy guy out?

3230
01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:35,330
Yeah, I think so.

3231
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:37,710
I was just like...

3232
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:40,170
But it's a green button.

3233
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:41,930
Green button means good, right?

3234
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:43,990
He's cured!

3235
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:45,470
We did it, guys!

3236
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:46,050
He's so good!

3237
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,890
We cured him!

3238
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:47,610
Come out!

3239
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:50,750
Oh.

3240
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,590
You're not supposed to be here!

3241
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:55,190
Oh, my God!

3242
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:56,970
Don't you just let him in...

3243
01:41:56,970 --> 01:41:57,510
Fucking...

3244
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:58,750
Just letting him...

3245
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:00,130
Fucking, uh...

3246
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:01,590
Bludgeoned this poor doctor?

3247
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:04,810
What's this?

3248
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:05,570
Oh, it's in our key.

3249
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:08,010
Observation room.

3250
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:10,170
To be observed.

3251
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:12,390
I think it was like back here, right?

3252
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:14,530
Um...

3253
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:14,730
Yeah.

3254
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:17,370
Oh, yeah, you were definitely not paying attention.

3255
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:19,350
Room 5...

3256
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:19,970
I'm not the one playing.

3257
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:20,790
I don't need to pay attention.

3258
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:22,950
Wait, then what's the point of you being here?

3259
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:25,210
Moral support.

3260
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:27,350
Uh-oh, yes.

3261
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:29,350
Oh, so it's forward.

3262
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:31,190
There's nothing back here.

3263
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:32,410
Mm-hmm.

3264
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:34,890
I don't feel morally supported right now.

3265
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:36,050
What?

3266
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:37,910
Wait, go back down the hallway.

3267
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,070
No, that's the exit.

3268
01:42:40,630 --> 01:42:42,070
No, I think it just said exit.

3269
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:44,170
Oh, it's over there.

3270
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:47,070
Oh, my God, chat.

3271
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:48,150
You were so right, chat.

3272
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:49,570
I was supposed to go down here.

3273
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:54,070
Okay, close the door.

3274
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:56,550
You're gonna regret that.

3275
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,730
Who gave this guy a knife?

3276
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:06,330
They have ways of sneaking them in.

3277
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:08,150
How do you know that?

3278
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:13,530
How do you know about the psychiatric ward and sneaking in knives?

3279
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:16,010
I'm a ghost for a reason.

3280
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:18,230
Wait.

3281
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:20,850
You died in the crazy ward?

3282
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:22,770
I don't know.

3283
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,490
I might have.

3284
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:25,810
Oh, my God.

3285
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:26,790
I know ghosts that have.

3286
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:28,290
Oh, like who?

3287
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:31,130
Name one ghost that you know.

3288
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:32,570
Name one ghost.

3289
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:34,710
Name one ghost that you know.

3290
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:37,130
What kind of name are you expecting?

3291
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:38,630
Like...

3292
01:43:39,390 --> 01:43:39,870
Spooky...

3293
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:41,490
Spooky McJohnson?

3294
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:42,330
Yes.

3295
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:45,170
My good friend.

3296
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:47,450
I could literally say, there's a ghost named George.

3297
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:48,810
And like, that's just legit.

3298
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:51,070
Oh, why is there tar spots now?

3299
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:55,230
So that you can follow the feet.

3300
01:43:55,470 --> 01:43:56,090
Oh, that's true.

3301
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:56,730
That's so true.

3302
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:57,950
It's hand holding you.

3303
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:59,790
Yeah, is that Spooky McJohnson right there?

3304
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:01,050
It could be.

3305
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:04,230
He got confused.

3306
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:06,950
He's like, I don't even know where to go.

3307
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:10,190
He took a little view outside and then went to the showers.

3308
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:11,390
He's looking outside.

3309
01:44:11,410 --> 01:44:13,130
He's like, oh, what a lovely view.

3310
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:15,190
I stick my hand in tar.

3311
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:16,030
No way.

3312
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:17,250
In the black hole.

3313
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:18,390
It's like Silent Hill.

3314
01:44:18,930 --> 01:44:19,130
No way.

3315
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:20,710
It really is Silent Hill.

3316
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:22,810
Oh.

3317
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:26,210
Oh, wait.

3318
01:44:26,350 --> 01:44:27,450
I'm just flushing it out.

3319
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:28,610
Oh, I'm unclogging it.

3320
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:31,530
What the fuck is this?

3321
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:33,210
Spooky McJohnson, what did you do?

3322
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:35,550
What did you do, Spooky McJohnson?

3323
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:37,330
Wait.

3324
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:38,850
Is this Dwayne?

3325
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:39,770
Is this Dwayne?

3326
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:42,450
Is this Dwayne or Ouroi guided Johnson?

3327
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:44,490
What is this?

3328
01:44:44,670 --> 01:44:45,650
Electric box.

3329
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:47,130
Where...

3330
01:44:47,130 --> 01:44:47,990
Where was that?

3331
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:49,970
In the toilet.

3332
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:51,230
In the control...

3333
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:51,990
OK, alright.

3334
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:54,070
Was that in the control room?

3335
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:55,890
No, they're showing you where to go.

3336
01:44:58,810 --> 01:44:59,330
Hello?

3337
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:02,130
What if these are our footprints now?

3338
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:04,290
Because we got in the nasty toilet.

3339
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:08,190
Alright, go back here, I guess?

3340
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:10,710
They're literally like, hey, by the way, it's in here.

3341
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:12,590
Oh.

3342
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:14,270
What?

3343
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:17,310
Tricked ya!

3344
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:23,010
Okay!

3345
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:23,790
Okay.

3346
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:30,410
I think... I think... Oh my god!

3347
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:31,370
Oh my god, where's his eyes?

3348
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:33,710
The tar man!

3349
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:35,470
Oh my god, the tar man!

3350
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:38,230
It's him!

3351
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:38,890
Wait, is that a death?

3352
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:40,430
Is it?

3353
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:42,830
No, I think he just tranquilized me.

3354
01:45:43,190 --> 01:45:43,330
No way.

3355
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:43,330
Yeah.

3356
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:48,170
Because they tranquilized the other guy after he, like, bludgeoned the doctor with his crutch.

3357
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:49,730
They should have not given him crutches.

3358
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:51,890
Why did they give him crutches wheeling him out in a wheelchair?

3359
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:58,110
He deserves to have... Don't give him the... No!

3360
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:00,290
Don't give him the... Okay.

3361
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:01,310
Okay, buddy.

3362
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:06,190
Don't give him the ability to walk if he's just gonna commit crime.

3363
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:08,230
No, maybe, yeah.

3364
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:09,670
Ooh!

3365
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:11,130
What's going on in here?

3366
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:12,410
I'm lost.

3367
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:13,550
Can you see anything?

3368
01:46:13,790 --> 01:46:15,650
Yeah, my flashlight started bugging up.

3369
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:17,410
Alright.

3370
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:19,650
I don't like how I'm going downstairs.

3371
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:23,510
I feel like I'm gonna be trapped in here.

3372
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:25,710
Hello?

3373
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:27,710
I guess you don't need to be in...

3374
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:28,990
Yeah, where the hell are you going?

3375
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:29,550
Where am I?

3376
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:29,970
Oh!

3377
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:32,910
It's time.

3378
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:33,910
It's my initiation.

3379
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:34,690
Yeah.

3380
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:35,670
To the no-shirt cult.

3381
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:37,170
Take off your shirt!

3382
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:38,370
Take it off!

3383
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:39,830
Remove your clothes!

3384
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:42,650
Join us!

3385
01:46:43,450 --> 01:46:44,410
Join us!

3386
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:45,670
You will be freed!

3387
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:48,050
You will remove your inhibitions!

3388
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:49,990
Send us to five people!

3389
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:53,010
Take it off!

3390
01:46:53,710 --> 01:46:53,990
Woo!

3391
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:54,590
Woo!

3392
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:00,370
One of us.

3393
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:01,890
One of us.

3394
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:04,970
Alright.

3395
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:06,290
I'm watching TV.

3396
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:07,650
No.

3397
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:08,770
There's nothing on.

3398
01:47:08,950 --> 01:47:09,790
Change the channel!

3399
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:11,850
Fix it!

3400
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:12,810
Fix the TV!

3401
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:15,030
This is not a human right!

3402
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:17,790
Refusing to give me a channel to watch!

3403
01:47:18,790 --> 01:47:19,090
Oh.

3404
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:19,710
Where am I?

3405
01:47:20,630 --> 01:47:22,210
Are we in dad's parkour room?

3406
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:23,290
Oh my...

3407
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:24,450
You see?

3408
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:27,410
Whoa.

3409
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:28,650
Okay.

3410
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:29,210
Okay.

3411
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:31,670
I did not say give me more TVs.

3412
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:33,010
There's nothing to watch, though.

3413
01:47:33,850 --> 01:47:33,970
Oh.

3414
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:35,190
Whoa.

3415
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:38,950
What am I supposed to do?

3416
01:47:39,230 --> 01:47:39,750
Oh.

3417
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:41,470
You think he's...

3418
01:47:41,470 --> 01:47:41,790
Oh.

3419
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:42,430
Hello there.

3420
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:44,410
Again?

3421
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:45,170
Hello.

3422
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:46,690
What am I supposed to do?

3423
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:49,510
Crawl through there.

3424
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:53,150
Now what are you gonna do?

3425
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:53,570
It's outlast...

3426
01:47:53,570 --> 01:47:54,710
It's outlast all of a sudden.

3427
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:56,670
Guys, are you gonna go on to the other side?

3428
01:47:57,310 --> 01:47:57,750
Yeah.

3429
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:58,990
He's gonna come and get you.

3430
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:01,770
I'm slowly stumbling over.

3431
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:04,050
You have to find something to cut the eye open.

3432
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:06,690
Um.

3433
01:48:12,650 --> 01:48:13,770
Oh, I'm so scared.

3434
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:14,990
You seem so frustrated.

3435
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:18,390
Yeah.

3436
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:19,590
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

3437
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:23,950
The way he like stops and like just kind of like contemplates what's going on.

3438
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:27,310
He's like, I got you now.

3439
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:28,890
You're not gonna escape me.

3440
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:29,470
What are you gonna do?

3441
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:32,550
Crawl through that space again and go to the other side?

3442
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:34,130
She's gaming, you guys.

3443
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:35,230
I'm gaming right now.

3444
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:35,670
I'm gaming.

3445
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:38,970
Oh, look at me juking this cripple.

3446
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:40,130
Let me go.

3447
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:42,850
Yeah.

3448
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,390
Oh, you're so close.

3449
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,290
You're so close.

3450
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:45,990
Whoa.

3451
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:47,270
Okay.

3452
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:49,510
What am I supposed to do?

3453
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:52,910
You just have to find a sharp object to cut the eye.

3454
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:56,090
That's exactly what the game told you.

3455
01:48:56,090 --> 01:48:56,490
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

3456
01:48:56,590 --> 01:48:56,830
Wait a minute.

3457
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:57,670
He's actually really fast.

3458
01:48:57,950 --> 01:48:58,270
Wait a minute.

3459
01:48:59,170 --> 01:49:00,670
He's actually incredibly fast.

3460
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:02,150
Wait, how did he get here already?

3461
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:04,570
You deserve this.

3462
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:05,650
No, I don't.

3463
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:06,630
I'm a good person.

3464
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:11,250
Good people don't say that they're a good person.

3465
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:12,370
Oh, what is he gonna do?

3466
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:13,350
Oh, he's confused.

3467
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:16,170
He's so confused.

3468
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:18,930
He's like, is she gonna go left?

3469
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:20,110
Is she gonna go right?

3470
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:24,710
He's doing his staple.

3471
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:29,410
Where am I gonna go?

3472
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:30,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3473
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:31,810
Left or right?

3474
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:32,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3475
01:49:33,730 --> 01:49:35,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3476
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:36,990
You're so confused.

3477
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:39,550
Oh, whoa.

3478
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:41,190
All right.

3479
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:42,390
I need to find the sharp knife.

3480
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:43,410
Okay.

3481
01:49:44,910 --> 01:49:45,510
Wait.

3482
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:46,290
He's right there.

3483
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:47,550
Yeah.

3484
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:48,170
Yeah.

3485
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:49,370
Oops.

3486
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:52,950
He's like, actually kind of fast.

3487
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:53,590
Yeah.

3488
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:54,930
So, oh, there it is.

3489
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:56,070
There it is.

3490
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:56,690
Nice.

3491
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:57,850
How do I?

3492
01:49:58,170 --> 01:49:58,390
Whoa.

3493
01:49:59,210 --> 01:49:59,990
Go back to the eye.

3494
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:03,990
Okay.

3495
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:05,290
All right.

3496
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:06,830
Got the knife.

3497
01:50:06,950 --> 01:50:08,130
I'm gonna poke you.

3498
01:50:08,490 --> 01:50:09,790
I'm gonna poke you.

3499
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:12,290
I'm gonna poke you.

3500
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:13,490
I hear sounds.

3501
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:14,770
Is there a baby in there?

3502
01:50:14,970 --> 01:50:15,570
Is it?

3503
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:18,030
And then, like, a baby is born?

3504
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:20,030
Ooh, that looks like it hurts.

3505
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:20,490
Ew.

3506
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:21,690
Oh, I hate this.

3507
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:22,070
I hate the sound.

3508
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:24,930
Pop, it's a boy!

3509
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:29,890
Is that what the inside of the eye looks like?

3510
01:50:31,490 --> 01:50:31,930
Yeah.

3511
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,010
Oh, like, actually?

3512
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:34,370
Is he back?

3513
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:34,710
Oh, wait.

3514
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:35,150
He's gone.

3515
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:36,870
He's gone.

3516
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:37,730
Yeah, he's gone.

3517
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:40,690
It's like, well, my job here is done.

3518
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:42,010
That was gross.

3519
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:45,110
Pop goes the weasel.

3520
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:48,390
I could live in here.

3521
01:50:50,330 --> 01:50:51,170
Like, it's warm.

3522
01:50:51,170 --> 01:50:53,150
You are one step away from Vore.

3523
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:54,930
Wait.

3524
01:50:55,310 --> 01:50:55,910
Wait, is it?

3525
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:56,910
Is this Vore?

3526
01:50:58,710 --> 01:51:00,710
You are actually one step away.

3527
01:51:00,990 --> 01:51:04,090
It really, it really was in her bookmarks, you guys.

3528
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:09,990
I just needed to start, like, I need, like, the stomach acid.

3529
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:10,850
Then, uh...

3530
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,530
I didn't send it to five people.

3531
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,810
This is what happened to me.

3532
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:20,670
It's possessing your mind.

3533
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:22,690
You're starting to like it.

3534
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:26,430
Alright, I'm out here now.

3535
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:28,550
I hate the doors.

3536
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:30,610
Why are the doors so hard to open?

3537
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:31,690
I don't know.

3538
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:32,370
Yeah.

3539
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:33,890
They're, like, so clunky.

3540
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:35,010
And I'm having...

3541
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:36,010
I'm using easy door.

3542
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:38,070
What is easy door?

3543
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:38,730
I don't know.

3544
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:40,190
But it's easier than hard door.

3545
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:42,810
Wait, that's like a setting?

3546
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:43,450
Easy door?

3547
01:51:43,670 --> 01:51:43,890
Yeah.

3548
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:46,370
Yeah, it's an actual setting.

3549
01:51:46,990 --> 01:51:50,130
Maybe hard door is you have to, like, actually grab the handle or something.

3550
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:50,870
Oh.

3551
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:52,450
You have to, like, aim for it.

3552
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:53,390
It's, like, more immersive.

3553
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:56,570
Like, it makes you feel like you're actually opening a door.

3554
01:51:57,610 --> 01:51:58,930
It doesn't, but, you know.

3555
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:01,090
Whatever the game would like to think.

3556
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:04,950
I feel like I don't follow the footsteps because, like...

3557
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:07,930
I came from the footsteps.

3558
01:52:09,230 --> 01:52:09,630
Right?

3559
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:11,030
Oh.

3560
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:16,330
Yeah, and then I have to use this on the control room because it's an electricity thing.

3561
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:17,210
Yeah.

3562
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:18,150
Maybe?

3563
01:52:18,430 --> 01:52:18,810
No?

3564
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:19,590
No?

3565
01:52:20,030 --> 01:52:21,050
Where does this go?

3566
01:52:22,190 --> 01:52:23,110
I have this.

3567
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,730
I don't know where it...

3568
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:25,190
Yeah, the control...

3569
01:52:25,190 --> 01:52:25,850
What is that?

3570
01:52:25,850 --> 01:52:27,530
Is there, like, a handle on the...

3571
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:29,670
What is this, anyway?

3572
01:52:31,450 --> 01:52:32,510
Is there a handle?

3573
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:33,410
No?

3574
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:37,390
I don't know where I'm supposed to go with this.

3575
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:39,830
I don't know, actually.

3576
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:41,050
Yeah, me too.

3577
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:43,450
Do I actually follow the footsteps?

3578
01:52:44,430 --> 01:52:45,290
Maybe they reset.

3579
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,510
Oh, maybe.

3580
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:49,470
Maybe they go to a different...

3581
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:51,190
If they go to the window, then...

3582
01:52:51,190 --> 01:52:52,270
Yeah, no, it's the same...

3583
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:53,690
It's the same sightseeing.

3584
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,070
Yeah.

3585
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:55,170
They, like, look out...

3586
01:52:55,170 --> 01:52:55,350
Sightseeing.

3587
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,410
Oh, wait, there's more, no?

3588
01:52:58,590 --> 01:52:59,650
No, this is where I got the handle.

3589
01:53:00,330 --> 01:53:02,410
And this is where I got, like, tranquilized, remember?

3590
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:03,110
Oh, that's right.

3591
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:03,490
Yeah.

3592
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:05,650
Yeah, this was the tranquilizing room.

3593
01:53:06,630 --> 01:53:07,730
No, that was...

3594
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:08,290
Yeah, yeah.

3595
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:09,070
Oh, you're right, you're right.

3596
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:10,670
Yeah, I got tranquilized right here.

3597
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:12,850
Like, took me to their special room.

3598
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:13,790
Yeah.

3599
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:16,590
Oh, my God.

3600
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:16,990
Oh, my God.

3601
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:17,970
What are you doing here?

3602
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:19,130
Yeah, see?

3603
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:20,810
This is where I got, like, hit.

3604
01:53:21,450 --> 01:53:22,310
Through the window.

3605
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:22,690
Yeah.

3606
01:53:22,690 --> 01:53:23,210
Through the wall.

3607
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:25,270
There's a guy in there, too.

3608
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:27,490
There's no one here.

3609
01:53:28,670 --> 01:53:29,510
That's our room.

3610
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:30,190
It's not our time.

3611
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:32,670
This room was made for me.

3612
01:53:33,330 --> 01:53:34,630
Oh, electric room made me!

3613
01:53:34,830 --> 01:53:35,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3614
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:39,290
Oh, is this?

3615
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:41,170
The handle is missing.

3616
01:53:41,790 --> 01:53:41,910
Oh.

3617
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:44,970
And then God said, let there be light.

3618
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:46,990
Wait, all the doors might have opened now.

3619
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:51,910
Now what do I do?

3620
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:56,710
Was there something that couldn't be opened because of the power?

3621
01:53:57,590 --> 01:53:58,670
I don't remember.

3622
01:53:58,910 --> 01:53:59,410
Not being on?

3623
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:01,170
I don't remember.

3624
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:04,890
Is it room 13?

3625
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:05,890
This room?

3626
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:08,490
No?

3627
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:10,450
No?

3628
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:12,350
No?

3629
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:15,150
Daddy's mad.

3630
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:18,230
Lucy?

3631
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:18,870
Lucy?

3632
01:54:19,570 --> 01:54:20,990
Daddy doesn't know where to go!

3633
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:28,530
I don't like this.

3634
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:31,770
Oh, maybe this door is open now?

3635
01:54:32,190 --> 01:54:32,590
No?

3636
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:35,170
What the fuck?

3637
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:37,590
Just maybe keep following the hallway.

3638
01:54:40,530 --> 01:54:40,930
Hello?

3639
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:42,390
I think all of these are just whatever.

3640
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:43,330
Oh, the elevator!

3641
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:44,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3642
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:45,830
Oh, okay.

3643
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:46,570
It was the elevator.

3644
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:47,790
All right.

3645
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:48,350
Yippee!

3646
01:54:48,530 --> 01:54:48,890
Yippee!

3647
01:54:49,030 --> 01:54:49,790
We're figuring it out.

3648
01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:50,470
We're so smart.

3649
01:54:50,830 --> 01:54:51,490
I know.

3650
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:51,930
Wow.

3651
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,150
All on our own.

3652
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:55,610
No help whatsoever.

3653
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:56,990
No help.

3654
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:00,290
Oh, am I gonna be back in my house?

3655
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:01,770
Don't take me back to the house.

3656
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:02,910
I don't have pills.

3657
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:05,130
Let me stay in the hospital.

3658
01:55:05,370 --> 01:55:05,570
Oh.

3659
01:55:05,770 --> 01:55:06,790
With all the pills.

3660
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:07,590
This is fancy.

3661
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:09,010
Oh, this is a VIP.

3662
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:11,950
This is where people who have insurance go to.

3663
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:17,170
This is the insurance ward.

3664
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:22,110
I'm in a private hospital right now.

3665
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:22,670
With a private wing.

3666
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:23,130
Yeah.

3667
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:29,150
Oh, I have to go this way.

3668
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:31,010
Wait, this is so much fancier.

3669
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:33,110
Is this what privilege gets you?

3670
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:33,970
Wow.

3671
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:36,310
Like everything is fresh and clean.

3672
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:38,450
Yeah, there's like plants everywhere.

3673
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:39,090
Yeah.

3674
01:55:40,570 --> 01:55:41,050
Okay.

3675
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:41,490
Wow.

3676
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:42,050
Oh my God.

3677
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:43,130
They get their own water.

3678
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:43,790
Oh, okay.

3679
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:46,110
They get their own water cooler.

3680
01:55:46,610 --> 01:55:47,590
Five FPS.

3681
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:49,450
Oh, good news.

3682
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:50,350
Oh, look.

3683
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:51,390
You can walk now.

3684
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:53,550
I don't think so.

3685
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:01,080
I don't think he's awake, doctor.

3686
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,280
I don't think he's like...

3687
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:02,780
Oh, no, no, no.

3688
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,700
He's moving his hands.

3689
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:06,200
You see that little twitch there?

3690
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:08,180
Wait, the doctor doesn't have a nose.

3691
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:09,140
Oh, wait.

3692
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:09,620
You're right.

3693
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:11,440
Oh, he's faceless.

3694
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:12,200
Yeah.

3695
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:12,980
Wait, I can be closer.

3696
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:13,380
Oh.

3697
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:14,520
Oh.

3698
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:15,000
Oh, I was too close.

3699
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,800
The doctor was Voldemort this whole time?

3700
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,260
Look, he needed a new career change.

3701
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:21,580
Okay?

3702
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,260
He's like, you can go home.

3703
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:30,800
Look, he had...

3704
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,000
Look, he got...

3705
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,080
Ever since he got kicked out of the Wizarding World, he had to find a new job.

3706
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:42,540
Oh, no.

3707
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:44,360
He locked me up.

3708
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:46,080
Wait, I'm not the crazy one.

3709
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:47,840
Sit in the chair.

3710
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:48,660
No?

3711
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:49,400
They won't let me.

3712
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:51,040
It's because I can walk.

3713
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,440
They don't let walkers on the chair.

3714
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,080
Is there something on the desk where the light is?

3715
01:56:58,480 --> 01:56:59,400
I'm checking the TV.

3716
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:01,580
What?

3717
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:02,960
Let's check the drawers?

3718
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,660
No, I can't open it.

3719
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:07,140
What's that sound?

3720
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,160
Wait, the drawer's where the lamp is?

3721
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:10,720
The fuck?

3722
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:13,200
Can't open those either?

3723
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:16,140
Put my flashlight on the other pocket.

3724
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:17,780
Hello?

3725
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:18,380
Nurse?

3726
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:19,900
Someone said try to move the shelf.

3727
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:20,600
Can you move it?

3728
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:21,340
Oh!

3729
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:23,600
Oh!

3730
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,720
There's like the scrapes!

3731
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:26,060
Yeah!

3732
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:27,760
Oh my god.

3733
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:30,260
This game is too smart for streamers.

3734
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:31,020
This...

3735
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:33,460
No, we're so smart.

3736
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:34,520
We figured it out.

3737
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,400
Guys, streamers don't look down.

3738
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:37,400
We all know that.

3739
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:39,680
Everybody knows gamers don't look up.

3740
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:40,860
Or down.

3741
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:42,080
Or behind.

3742
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,320
We just look forward.

3743
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:44,100
Yeah.

3744
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:45,720
Or gas, gas, gas, gas.

3745
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:46,960
Exactly.

3746
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:49,200
Alright, I can fit that.

3747
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:51,840
Okay, I can't.

3748
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:59,100
Just because I had one grape, I can't fit the hole.

3749
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:02,380
Not the single grape.

3750
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:06,380
The single grape that expanded me a little bit.

3751
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,180
One centimeter wide.

3752
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:11,980
Down I go.

3753
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:13,160
Wait, take the flashlight.

3754
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:13,960
Why do I...

3755
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:14,300
Yeah, take the flashlight.

3756
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:14,940
Yeah, what the fuck?

3757
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:15,580
Take the flashlight.

3758
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:15,980
What's wrong with you?

3759
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:16,880
What's wrong with me?

3760
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:18,400
Take the fucking flashlight.

3761
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:18,660
Do it!

3762
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,440
Oh my god!

3763
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:20,720
I can use...

3764
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:21,960
I have two hands!

3765
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:23,600
Put it in your mouth!

3766
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,140
Oh, you're back home?

3767
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:25,880
Oh, I'm back home.

3768
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:28,800
No flashlights allowed in the house.

3769
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:30,380
Daddy's rules.

3770
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,000
Daddy said no flashlight.

3771
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:34,620
Wait.

3772
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:36,800
Actually, I don't think you're back home.

3773
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,140
I don't think this is home.

3774
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:38,500
Oh!

3775
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,160
Oh, hi.

3776
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:40,760
Hello?

3777
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:41,920
He's observing us!

3778
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:45,620
I like the...

3779
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:46,420
The subtitle.

3780
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,380
Who's Raka?

3781
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:53,000
Who's they?

3782
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:54,060
That's him!

3783
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:56,540
That's the guy that's been chasing us and crutches!

3784
01:58:56,660 --> 01:58:57,200
What do you mean?

3785
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:58,120
I know!

3786
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:00,160
But like, who is that in the story?

3787
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:01,880
I'm on to you?

3788
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:02,880
Who's that guy?

3789
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:03,660
Who sent you?

3790
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:04,780
Oh.

3791
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:05,140
What?

3792
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:06,240
Oh.

3793
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:10,440
Do you think he's okay?

3794
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:14,980
Are those happy screams?

3795
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:17,640
You can probably leave now.

3796
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:18,580
No, wait.

3797
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:20,040
I want to hear him scream a little longer.

3798
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:24,870
It's gonna loop eventually.

3799
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,850
Is it?

3800
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:27,010
He can't scream forever.

3801
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:30,130
Oh, see?

3802
01:59:30,210 --> 01:59:30,370
Look.

3803
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:32,230
He got rapture.

3804
01:59:34,830 --> 01:59:36,470
He drank the Red Bull!

3805
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:36,970
Yay!

3806
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:38,450
He drank the cooling!

3807
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:40,870
He got wings!

3808
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:41,750
Oh.

3809
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:42,630
Oh.

3810
01:59:42,830 --> 01:59:43,090
Whoa.

3811
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:43,290
Whoa.

3812
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:43,830
Whoa.

3813
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:47,730
Poke the eyeball.

3814
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:49,330
Poke.

3815
01:59:50,810 --> 01:59:51,650
One last...

3816
01:59:51,650 --> 01:59:53,430
One last eyeball for the ride.

3817
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:54,330
Yeah.

3818
01:59:54,490 --> 01:59:55,290
I wonder if it's like...

3819
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:56,330
You know, like there's like...

3820
01:59:56,990 --> 01:59:58,050
Oh, what the fuck?

3821
01:59:58,150 --> 01:59:58,970
No, this one's ours.

3822
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:00,230
Oh, this is probably...

3823
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:00,530
Yeah!

3824
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:02,930
We even completed a chapter!

3825
02:00:03,090 --> 02:00:03,650
We did it!

3826
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:06,490
This chapter was a lot less scary.

3827
02:00:07,070 --> 02:00:07,930
It was really fast.

3828
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:09,370
Yeah, this one was a...

3829
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:11,490
It was a nice and easy chapter.

3830
02:00:11,710 --> 02:00:12,170
I like that.

3831
02:00:12,170 --> 02:00:13,550
Prison.

3832
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:17,470
And silenced.

3833
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:20,230
Wait, I don't have lighters anymore.

3834
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:22,110
Wait, what happened to my lighter?

3835
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:25,670
Wait, what happened to my lighter?

3836
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:27,810
Wait a minute.

3837
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:31,850
You know what?

3838
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:34,990
That's for future Doki to worry about.

3839
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:36,810
So true.

3840
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:40,990
That is future Doki's problem.

3841
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:44,250
Wait, they closed all the door.

3842
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:46,490
Where are we?

3843
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:49,090
Back home?

3844
02:00:49,230 --> 02:00:49,810
I can't see anything.

3845
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:50,250
I can't see anything.

3846
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:51,270
Oh, you can hide.

3847
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:53,150
Yes.

3848
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:53,610
Oh.

3849
02:00:54,170 --> 02:00:55,090
Oh, there we go.

3850
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:58,070
I don't like how I have no items whatsoever.

3851
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,690
What's so...

3852
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:01,130
They stole from you.

3853
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:02,670
They stole my lady.

3854
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:04,470
Those freaks.

3855
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:05,710
Stupid ghost.

3856
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:08,450
That's why you guys don't deserve rights.

3857
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:10,830
What?

3858
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:12,490
You don't even know.

3859
02:01:12,610 --> 02:01:13,050
I got...

3860
02:01:13,050 --> 02:01:16,610
If you're dead, what type of rights do you need when you're dead?

3861
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:19,250
Why wouldn't we have rights?

3862
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:20,110
Because you're dead.

3863
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:22,150
Wait, you're saying all ghosts are the same?

3864
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:24,130
Like all ghosts are gonna steal your lighters?

3865
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:25,210
Yes.

3866
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,790
Yes.

3867
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:30,090
I know you have a stash of lighters.

3868
02:01:30,270 --> 02:01:31,150
I didn't steal it.

3869
02:01:31,330 --> 02:01:32,290
Yeah, because someone...

3870
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:34,410
Another ghost already stole it.

3871
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:35,970
I bought all my lighters.

3872
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:37,450
I didn't steal these from people.

3873
02:01:37,870 --> 02:01:39,070
That's what they say.

3874
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:40,070
Yeah, that's right.

3875
02:01:40,150 --> 02:01:40,710
I bought it.

3876
02:01:40,730 --> 02:01:41,810
Speak to the ghost cops.

3877
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:47,790
Where's my eyeball?

3878
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:48,450
Only one chocolate!

3879
02:01:51,810 --> 02:01:53,690
Guys, I'm not gonna do the next chapter right now.

3880
02:01:53,850 --> 02:01:55,790
I don't have anything and I don't...

3881
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:57,410
The only thing I have is a camera.

3882
02:01:58,470 --> 02:01:59,010
Beep, beep.

3883
02:02:00,610 --> 02:02:01,010
Snap.

3884
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:03,090
That goes into my cringe compilation.

3885
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:06,630
And then there's my personal confessional.

3886
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:07,690
Yeah.

3887
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:08,690
You are forgiven.

3888
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:09,110
Did you get that fixed?

3889
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:10,550
No, I need to go to...

3890
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:12,870
I need to go to like a store to buy a new one.

3891
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:17,130
So I can be like, You are forgiven for your crimes.

3892
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:19,530
Next week, we finish it?

3893
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:26,270
Wait, someone said storage replenishes items.

3894
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:27,750
I think there's an actual storage.

3895
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:30,050
Someone said maybe in the...

3896
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:30,630
Wait, downstairs?

3897
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:31,630
There's a storage?

3898
02:02:31,930 --> 02:02:33,530
Okay, that's for future Doki.

3899
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:34,390
Don't worry about it.

3900
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:34,850
I'm not going to...

3901
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:36,210
Yeah, everybody remind us next time.

3902
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:44,730
Yeah, remind us next time that there is an extra storage for more lighters and pills for us.

3903
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:46,490
Remember.

3904
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:47,850
Alright, so...

3905
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:48,150
Yippee!

3906
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:49,230
We did two chapters!

3907
02:02:49,410 --> 02:02:50,970
One chapter left, guys!

3908
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,510
One chapter left!

3909
02:02:52,750 --> 02:02:56,130
Actually, I think this one was definitely a lot less scary.

3910
02:02:56,130 --> 02:03:00,230
Because it was like more linear and we're not in the house at all, which was great.

3911
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:02,390
Like, I don't have to worry about resource management.

3912
02:03:03,070 --> 02:03:05,890
No, the fact that we didn't have to worry about items was really nice.

3913
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:06,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3914
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:07,210
That one...

3915
02:03:07,210 --> 02:03:08,410
This one was so fucking stressful.

3916
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:10,870
It was so lit up.

3917
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:11,170
Yeah.

3918
02:03:11,410 --> 02:03:13,150
You got the worst one out of the way.

3919
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:14,310
Yeah.

3920
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:15,690
I think this other...

3921
02:03:15,690 --> 02:03:16,450
I think this chapter...

3922
02:03:16,450 --> 02:03:17,630
You have to be inside, though.

3923
02:03:17,810 --> 02:03:18,330
I'm pretty sure.

3924
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:19,890
This chapter...

3925
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:21,190
Yeah, it's like in the house.

3926
02:03:21,370 --> 02:03:23,810
I think this is the only chapter that's not in the house, too.

3927
02:03:24,570 --> 02:03:24,790
Oh.

3928
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:27,670
Oh, people are saying the last chapter is terrifying.

3929
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:28,230
Oh.

3930
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:32,650
Maybe I should have kept this one as the last one.

3931
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:37,010
You were like, I'm doing the easy one and you chose it so quickly.

3932
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:39,230
I just assumed...

3933
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:41,330
Supposedly the second chapter is the scariest.

3934
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:43,150
I assumed that like...

3935
02:03:43,150 --> 02:03:44,510
Okay, because I saw crutches.

3936
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:45,370
So I was like, okay.

3937
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:47,570
It's obviously that Ghost isn't going to chase...

3938
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:48,830
Like, it's not going to be that fast.

3939
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:50,610
Because he's like on a crutch, you know?

3940
02:03:51,050 --> 02:03:53,030
So like, he's going to be hobbling a lot.

3941
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:53,690
You should have saved it for the last line.

3942
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:54,370
Yeah, I know.

3943
02:03:54,550 --> 02:03:55,650
I was like, I...

3944
02:03:55,650 --> 02:03:57,830
Look, past Doki was not thinking straight.

3945
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:59,390
Okay, past Doki was like...

3946
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:01,430
He can't catch me if he can't walk.

3947
02:04:01,690 --> 02:04:02,310
You know, like...

3948
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:04,210
How am I going to die to a guy who can't walk?

3949
02:04:05,190 --> 02:04:07,170
Wait, people are saying there's four chapters.

3950
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:08,410
No, there's three chapters.

3951
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:11,190
There's only three bowls here.

3952
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:12,310
Yeah, there's three bowls.

3953
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:13,510
We know there's three...

3954
02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:16,910
If there's three bowls, there's three chapters.

3955
02:04:20,830 --> 02:04:21,510
Right?

3956
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:22,690
Right, guys?

3957
02:04:24,630 --> 02:04:25,310
Right?

3958
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:29,830
I think there's three and then a finale.

3959
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:31,130
There's a finale?

3960
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:32,250
No.

3961
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:33,070
No.

3962
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:35,170
That doesn't sound right.

3963
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:35,710
No.

3964
02:04:36,670 --> 02:04:37,010
No.

3965
02:04:37,870 --> 02:04:38,550
No.

3966
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:39,790
No.

3967
02:04:39,790 --> 02:04:39,970
No.

3968
02:04:40,070 --> 02:04:40,490
No.

3969
02:04:40,490 --> 02:04:43,350
The moment I see end credits, it's over.

3970
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:45,510
Yeah.

3971
02:04:48,730 --> 02:04:50,290
We don't make the rules, guys.

3972
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:51,310
Yeah, yeah, guys.

3973
02:04:51,390 --> 02:04:52,690
I said finish the game.

3974
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:55,870
And when you finish the game, the end credits show up.

3975
02:04:55,870 --> 02:04:56,530
So...

3976
02:04:58,210 --> 02:04:59,690
Sounds legit to me.

3977
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:00,610
Yeah, yeah.

3978
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:02,850
Anything past that is new game plus.

3979
02:05:03,270 --> 02:05:03,970
Yeah, new NG plus.

3980
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:04,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3981
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:06,590
I didn't say NG plus playthrough.

3982
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:07,430
I said...

3983
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:09,510
I said finish the game.

3984
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:12,350
And that's where the end credits start.

3985
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:13,970
What if the next one isn't so bad?

3986
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:14,910
Then we could do it.

3987
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,570
What?

3988
02:05:15,670 --> 02:05:17,490
The fourth chapter?

3989
02:05:17,870 --> 02:05:19,090
That doesn't exist?

3990
02:05:20,010 --> 02:05:22,930
The fourth chapter that doesn't exist, guys?

3991
02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:24,570
Because there's only three chapters?

3992
02:05:26,410 --> 02:05:27,410
Only three.

3993
02:05:27,590 --> 02:05:27,930
Yeah, okay.

3994
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:30,790
Wait.

3995
02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:33,090
All chapters before the...

3996
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:36,650
When was the last update when they added the fourth chapter?

3997
02:05:39,530 --> 02:05:42,910
Was it before or after the charity?

3998
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:48,250
All chapters before the game updated in 2020.

3999
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:50,830
2020?

4000
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:51,770
Wait.

4001
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:52,090
I don't know.

4002
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:53,190
I don't know when this game...

4003
02:05:53,190 --> 02:05:55,530
I know when the game first came out, there was three chapters.

4004
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:57,910
And then they added the fourth chapter later.

4005
02:05:58,430 --> 02:05:59,150
Later on.

4006
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:05,790
So whenever the game first came out...

4007
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:05,930
Oh, no.

4008
02:06:06,010 --> 02:06:07,930
Actually, when the game first came out, there was only one chapter.

4009
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:09,670
They just kept adding because it was early access.

4010
02:06:10,110 --> 02:06:12,430
Because Lucy was the very first chapter they added.

4011
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:14,430
Oh, okay.

4012
02:06:14,590 --> 02:06:14,690
Okay.

4013
02:06:14,990 --> 02:06:15,330
Yeah, yeah.

4014
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:19,070
And then they progressively just added more and more chapters in the end.

4015
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:23,670
And I'm so glad this one was a short one.

4016
02:06:23,870 --> 02:06:26,990
I'm trying to see if there's, like, updates on Steam, but I don't see any.

4017
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:29,510
Well, the game came... finished, like, a long time ago.

4018
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:32,330
I can't believe this is the only game they made, though.

4019
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:36,630
I thought they would make more after, like, how successful it was.

4020
02:06:37,150 --> 02:06:37,550
Right?

4021
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:44,590
Yeah, like, everybody talked... like, everybody... it's, like, one of the... I am not... What do you mean charity fraud?

4022
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:47,450
I'm literally playing the game.

4023
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:59,960
I can't commit fraud if the game is still being played.

4024
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:03,820
I can't... you can call me a fraud in five years, okay?

4025
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:06,600
In five years?

4026
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:09,800
In five years when I never complete the playthrough.

4027
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:16,260
If the game is progressively getting played every couple of years, then it's not a fraud.

4028
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:18,260
It's not...

4029
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:21,520
I'm just... One chapter a year, everybody.

4030
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:28,880
What if I make a... what if I make a... like, for the last chapter, I make a waiting room, but set it to, like, 2027 or something.

4031
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:30,620
Oh, my God.

4032
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:33,100
We schedule... we schedule...

4033
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:36,040
It's just always... it's always looming on your channel.

4034
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:37,380
On my channel?

4035
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:41,080
Like, final chapter, 2027.

4036
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:43,820
Everybody, look forward to it!

4037
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:47,220
April 17th, 4 p.m.

4038
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:48,220
PSD.

4039
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:48,860
Woo!

4040
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:52,340
Oh, yeah.

4041
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:56,580
So it's not fraud because the waiting room's there.

4042
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:59,440
The waiting room...

4043
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:00,680
Um...

4044
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:01,540
What if we do that?

4045
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:02,860
What if we actually...

4046
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:03,400
I mean, are you down?

4047
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:04,720
The final chapter?

4048
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,380
We set it up to 2026 or seven?

4049
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:09,760
And then it just...

4050
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:10,260
What if...

4051
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:13,860
Stays in the... stays on my channel for two... one to two years?

4052
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:17,080
You should have it at least one year.

4053
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:19,240
Or, like, put it for one year.

4054
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:19,700
Oh, okay.

4055
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:22,160
Our anniversary of this playthrough.

4056
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:22,900
All right.

4057
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:23,500
The final...

4058
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:25,420
Or you have it so that...

4059
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:28,240
People can knock the time down somehow.

4060
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:29,980
The knock the time down?

4061
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,220
How do they knock it?

4062
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,880
Yeah, like, you have it set for a year and then somehow...

4063
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:34,360
They have to...

4064
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:36,720
It's like, we have, like, missions and stuff.

4065
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4066
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:44,120
Like, objectives and achievements and be like, If you get this and you complete this mission, I'll take 10 days off of it.

4067
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:45,720
It's like, their own, like...

4068
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:46,000
There's like...

4069
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,700
What are those, like...

4070
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:50,400
Those, like, games that people do online?

4071
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:50,860
It's like...

4072
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,100
What is it called?

4073
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:53,400
Like, uh...

4074
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:55,240
Uh...

4075
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:55,940
Oh, my God.

4076
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:57,440
Like, there's, like, little puzzles and stuff.

4077
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:57,920
They do.

4078
02:08:58,140 --> 02:08:59,380
To unlock more stuff.

4079
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:00,540
I don't think people like our ideas.

4080
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:02,040
ARG!

4081
02:09:02,180 --> 02:09:03,780
We make this an ARG.

4082
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:06,840
They're sending a bunch of angry emojis.

4083
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:09,800
No.

4084
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:10,940
Like, we make it...

4085
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:12,380
We make it an ARG.

4086
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:18,440
And then, like, as they complete the ARG, we knock more time off of the...

4087
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,060
Off of it.

4088
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:21,460
All right.

4089
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:23,460
No gotcha for two.

4090
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:24,560
It's not gotcha.

4091
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:25,720
It's not gotcha.

4092
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:27,640
You just gotta complete our quest.

4093
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:30,140
To unlock the final chapter.

4094
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:30,700
Look at...

4095
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:31,100
I don't think...

4096
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:31,600
Okay, fine.

4097
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:32,480
We'll do chapter four.

4098
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:32,920
No.

4099
02:09:33,140 --> 02:09:34,520
We were going to.

4100
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:35,580
We were...

4101
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:37,660
How bad they are.

4102
02:09:38,620 --> 02:09:39,900
It'll be fun.

4103
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:42,900
The ARG will be fun, guys.

4104
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:43,660
The ARG...

4105
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:47,480
We'll make, like, mazes...

4106
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:48,220
And puzzles.

4107
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:52,520
And they have to, like, scan this QR code to complete this puzzle.

4108
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:53,880
It's like a geocache.

4109
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:55,200
We'll hide something somewhere.

4110
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:55,740
Yeah.

4111
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:56,760
We'll hide someone.

4112
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:57,240
Something.

4113
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:59,340
We'll pay someone to hide something.

4114
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:02,580
A little treasure chest in, like, the middle of the forest.

4115
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:10,680
And then, like, if you find it and scan that QR code, it reduces the timeline by a month or something.

4116
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:11,300
Like...

4117
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:12,300
It gives you...

4118
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:18,420
The QR code will give you the password to Doki's YouTube channel so that you can manually go and...

4119
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:20,500
Watch the timeline by yourself.

4120
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,640
You access my channel.

4121
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:23,320
Yeah.

4122
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,040
Give access.

4123
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,440
Change it.

4124
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:25,880
Look.

4125
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:27,240
We said chapter four.

4126
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:28,040
It'll be...

4127
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:29,840
It'll be locked next year.

4128
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:30,940
We didn't say chapter three.

4129
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:31,620
Okay?

4130
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:32,840
We're just planning ahead.

4131
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:33,680
We're...

4132
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:35,400
Yeah.

4133
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:37,060
You can start the stream yourself.

4134
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:39,080
You can be like, okay, Doki, play the game.

4135
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:42,140
You can start the stream.

4136
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:42,760
Yeah.

4137
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,220
Yo, I'm down.

4138
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,040
Let's make an ARG for the...

4139
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:48,960
Oh, my God.

4140
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,460
This is your charity thing.

4141
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:52,040
I am not affiliated, everybody.

4142
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:53,560
I am just here for moral support.

4143
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:58,260
So, please direct all your complaints and criticisms to Doki Bird channel.

4144
02:10:58,580 --> 02:10:58,640
Yeah, but the majority of the ideas came from...

4145
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:00,500
She was the one that came up with the geocache.

4146
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:01,180
I might make it.

4147
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:05,860
She came up with the geocache idea.

4148
02:11:05,860 --> 02:11:06,880
It's like that...

4149
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:11,780
It's like that Gravity Falls shit where they hid Bill Cypher in the middle of the fucking forest.

4150
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:12,180
Oh, yeah!

4151
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:12,920
I just hid...

4152
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:15,940
I just hide, like, a miniature replica of me and...

4153
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:18,680
I don't think anybody is going to do this.

4154
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:24,400
Wait, they waited a year for you to play this from the charity stream?

4155
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:26,240
Yeah, because the charity was last year.

4156
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:28,180
So, it's already been a year?

4157
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:29,520
Yeah, so then they...

4158
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:30,800
Okay, it's one chapter.

4159
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:35,360
I'm subbing, I'm remembering until April 2020.

4160
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:37,320
Until April 2020.

4161
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:38,900
The threats are real.

4162
02:11:40,780 --> 02:11:46,060
I'll come back to your channel when you play the fourth chapter.

4163
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,720
What do you mean?

4164
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:50,420
It'll be a fun experience!

4165
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:55,280
Like, we're uniting our fans on a little treasure hunt.

4166
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,020
Don't you guys like treasure hunts?

4167
02:11:57,460 --> 02:12:00,080
And the reward is just me streaming chapter four.

4168
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:01,280
We've already waited, though!

4169
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:03,500
Yeah, but it's chapter four!

4170
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:04,260
Chapter three...

4171
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:06,060
We're doing chapter three next week!

4172
02:12:06,260 --> 02:12:06,340
What?

4173
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:08,300
Premeditated anger.

4174
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:09,320
Pre...

4175
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:12,300
They're getting ready to be angry.

4176
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:18,140
It'll be fun, guys!

4177
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:19,800
No, we got through the last...

4178
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:21,300
We got through this one so easily.

4179
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:22,920
I think we can do the last two easy.

4180
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:24,820
Yeah, yeah, I think so, too.

4181
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:25,990
But it's more about...

4182
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:27,120
It's...

4183
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:27,740
No!

4184
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,140
We don't...

4185
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:32,020
We don't wanna play this treasure hunt.

4186
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:32,560
Everyone, it is so mad!

4187
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:37,240
Jokey, you have to go outside.

4188
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:37,640
I'm not...

4189
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:39,360
I can pay someone to hide it!

4190
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:40,800
I can literally...

4191
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,700
I just, like, hide it in Alaska or something.

4192
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,760
Like, it's buried in the snow in Alaska.

4193
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:49,040
And there's, like, a lot of people have to...

4194
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:49,720
Counter offer.

4195
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:53,000
We do that, but it's with Mint forcing you to play her copy of P.T.

4196
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:53,860
Oh, yeah.

4197
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:55,000
Do you wanna play P.T.?

4198
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:56,800
Oh, my goodness.

4199
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:00,820
I have to fly over for that.

4200
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:01,860
Yeah?

4201
02:13:01,860 --> 02:13:04,720
You're, like, the only one with a physical copy of P.T.

4202
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:07,860
P.T.

4203
02:13:07,860 --> 02:13:08,660
How much is the...

4204
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:09,420
Are those, anyway?

4205
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:10,220
Like, the play...

4206
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:12,980
Like, the PlayStation that houses a P.T.

4207
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:13,300
game?

4208
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:15,700
I have no idea, because I just kept mine.

4209
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:17,160
I feel like they'd be...

4210
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:20,140
It's, like, those people that sell their iPhone with a copy of Flappy Bird.

4211
02:13:20,340 --> 02:13:21,080
Flappy Bird?

4212
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:21,680
Yeah.

4213
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:22,160
Yeah, yeah.

4214
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:23,100
P.T.

4215
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:23,600
eBay.

4216
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:24,360
I'm gonna check.

4217
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:25,420
Oh, yeah, check, check, check.

4218
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:25,980
PS4 with P.T.

4219
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:26,480
on it.

4220
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:28,100
Oh, it's, like, $600.

4221
02:13:29,740 --> 02:13:31,200
How much is, like, a normal PS4 nowadays?

4222
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,040
Oh, wait, Canadian, though.

4223
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:32,920
Yeah, I was gonna say.

4224
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:33,940
How much...

4225
02:13:33,940 --> 02:13:34,240
Play...

4226
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:35,440
PS4...

4227
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:37,180
PS4, eBay.

4228
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:39,380
I feel like I should pause this game.

4229
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:42,600
I don't know if I'm slowly going crazy just standing in the confessional room.

4230
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,300
Oh, look, you're surrounded.

4231
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:44,640
Oh.

4232
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:49,240
It's, like, $200 Canadian for a normal...

4233
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:50,160
Like, $150.

4234
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:52,920
Oh, it's $150 for a normal PS4.

4235
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:54,520
So, like, your copy of P.T.

4236
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:55,540
is literally $500.

4237
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:57,060
Holy cow.

4238
02:13:57,060 --> 02:14:00,560
But if you wait longer, if you wait longer, the value goes up.

4239
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:02,580
I'm not...

4240
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:03,920
Well, yeah, I mean, yeah.

4241
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:05,900
You think about it.

4242
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:06,680
Cool.

4243
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:10,020
Wait, PS4 with P.T.

4244
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,780
I wanna see what it is on my end.

4245
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:16,460
Oh, yeah, cuz you get, like, the actual non-Monopoly money.

4246
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:18,860
I see one $328.

4247
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:20,640
I like this.

4248
02:14:20,780 --> 02:14:23,520
PlayStation 4, PS4 with playable trailer P.T.

4249
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:24,940
Silent Hill demo installed.

4250
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:25,460
Rare.

4251
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:26,300
Rare.

4252
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:29,000
It has 59 watchers.

4253
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:30,200
Oh, my God.

4254
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:33,520
They're hoping the prices will drop, but it'll never drop.

4255
02:14:33,860 --> 02:14:35,000
There's one with, like...

4256
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:35,360
They're seeking it out.

4257
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:37,240
Why is this one a thousand dollars?

4258
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:38,340
What the fuck?

4259
02:14:38,980 --> 02:14:39,380
What?

4260
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:41,400
Why is that one so expensive?

4261
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:42,640
I'm not seeing...

4262
02:14:42,640 --> 02:14:42,700
I'm not seeing...

4263
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:43,500
I'm only seeing the one.

4264
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:44,200
Oh, wait.

4265
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:45,540
Oh, this one is $864.

4266
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:46,060
Yeah.

4267
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,160
Like, why is it so expensive?

4268
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:51,820
Oh, cuz it's a rare white, like, version of the PS4.

4269
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:54,120
But I can get an illegal version where it's just a USB drive.

4270
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:56,700
I just buy...

4271
02:14:56,700 --> 02:15:01,660
Wait, I can just literally buy the USB drive and just plug it into my PS4.

4272
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:04,380
Uh, I mean, yeah?

4273
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:04,940
Yeah.

4274
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:06,200
That's like...

4275
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:06,900
So you play it.

4276
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:07,780
No.

4277
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:09,860
That's not part of charity.

4278
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,200
What?

4279
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:14,200
Then you gotta play chapter four, baby.

4280
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:17,120
Okay.

4281
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:23,260
It has been decided.

4282
02:15:23,620 --> 02:15:25,800
Well, chapter three is the scary one, apparently.

4283
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:26,500
So...

4284
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:27,320
Or, like, the...

4285
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,100
Or second chapter.

4286
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:28,840
Yeah, yeah.

4287
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:31,900
The second chapter is apparently the most scary one.

4288
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:33,080
So, like, the...

4289
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:36,620
So, the moment I get the grandma chapter out of the way...

4290
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:39,800
Chapter four can't be that bad, I assume.

4291
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:40,640
Let's see how...

4292
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:41,800
Let's see how long it is.

4293
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:42,760
The last chapter.

4294
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:43,380
The last chapter?

4295
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,480
Well, we'll find out next week how long it will be.

4296
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:45,720
Yeah.

4297
02:15:45,820 --> 02:15:45,980
Yeah.

4298
02:15:46,340 --> 02:15:46,700
No, no.

4299
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:47,800
The chapter four, I mean.

4300
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:48,720
Oh, chapter four?

4301
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:50,220
Yeah.

4302
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:51,500
Let's see.

4303
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:52,680
How long is it?

4304
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:56,540
I still think doing an AIG would be fucking funny.

4305
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:00,040
Oh.

4306
02:16:01,540 --> 02:16:01,980
Oh.

4307
02:16:02,260 --> 02:16:02,940
Yeah, oh.

4308
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:03,920
It's long.

4309
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:04,980
Oh, how long?

4310
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,380
Wait, okay.

4311
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:07,180
Someone...

4312
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:08,680
This is from a couple years ago, but they're like...

4313
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:10,940
But actually, this is keeping on track with our record.

4314
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:12,200
They said, this is our person...

4315
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:14,600
This is my personal experience on a scale of one to five.

4316
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:15,460
One being shortest.

4317
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,260
Five being longest to complete.

4318
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:17,860
Uh-huh.

4319
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:18,440
Three...

4320
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:20,640
Shortest was the one we just did.

4321
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:21,320
Uh-huh.

4322
02:16:22,180 --> 02:16:23,600
Second shortest is Lucy.

4323
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:25,580
Third shortest...

4324
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:28,300
Second to longest is the next one, Dolores.

4325
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:33,620
And then the end chapter is a little shorter than Dolores.

4326
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:35,560
Uh...

4327
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:37,400
You mean it's longer than Lucy?

4328
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:39,800
Um...

4329
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:42,380
Everyone's saying the grandma chapter is the scariest, too.

4330
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:43,560
Oh, wait.

4331
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:48,800
Someone also said, it will depend on which one you do first, as you generally need to explore the house and unlock some areas.

4332
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:51,040
I did Dolores first, and it was longest by far.

4333
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:55,700
But I think that was because I had a bit of exploring to do before getting to the core of the chapter.

4334
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:58,780
Oh, so you had to unlock certain areas, too.

4335
02:16:59,120 --> 02:16:59,440
Maybe.

4336
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:00,900
So we had to like...

4337
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:03,180
Well, I mean, like, we spent the second chapter...

4338
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:05,360
This chapter, like, in the hospital.

4339
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:06,140
I don't think we unlocked...

4340
02:17:06,140 --> 02:17:08,780
We didn't unlock anything in the last chapter.

4341
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:09,600
No.

4342
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:10,760
So I feel like...

4343
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:11,520
I feel like...

4344
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,260
But people are saying this next one is gonna be long.

4345
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:18,780
Her plot isn't linear like the other two.

4346
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:19,860
What do you mean linear?

4347
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,460
Like, Lucy wasn't that linear, was it?

4348
02:17:22,460 --> 02:17:23,600
Lucy was not linear.

4349
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:25,160
No, I have to explore a lot.

4350
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:26,960
I was like, where the fuck am I?

4351
02:17:28,380 --> 02:17:28,780
Okay.

4352
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,580
Oh, chapter four.

4353
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:31,700
Do you want me to just tell you?

4354
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:32,460
What?

4355
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:33,500
Tell me what.

4356
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:36,520
You have to get the VHS tapes that you've been collecting.

4357
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:37,100
Yeah?

4358
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:39,720
You have to get them for the last chapter.

4359
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:43,000
What?

4360
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:45,400
Yeah.

4361
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:47,820
I have to actually...

4362
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:48,300
What?

4363
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:49,500
You've been getting them regardless.

4364
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:50,740
You just got two of them.

4365
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:51,660
You already have two of them.

4366
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:53,080
Yes, you do.

4367
02:17:53,740 --> 02:17:54,560
How much...

4368
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:56,220
How many tapes are there?

4369
02:17:57,100 --> 02:17:57,720
I don't know.

4370
02:17:58,020 --> 02:17:58,240
How many?

4371
02:17:59,460 --> 02:18:00,200
I don't know.

4372
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:01,280
Maybe three, I guess?

4373
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:03,100
What do you mean?

4374
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:05,340
What do you mean I felt...

4375
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:07,640
You mean I was supposed to pick things up?

4376
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:10,760
You have them in your inventory right now!

4377
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:14,120
You have them!

4378
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:17,380
But like, how many are there?

4379
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:18,320
Oh, there's seven tapes?

4380
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,080
Oh.

4381
02:18:20,540 --> 02:18:23,040
I hope I'm getting the last five at Dolores.

4382
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:28,000
I hope the last five is with Dolores.

4383
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:29,960
Oh, no.

4384
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:30,980
Oh.

4385
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:33,460
So, like, about that ARG that we're doing.

4386
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:35,420
With the last chapter.

4387
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:36,320
Oh.

4388
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:38,180
About that ARG, man.

4389
02:18:40,020 --> 02:18:42,380
This is your decision.

4390
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:42,520
I...

4391
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:43,920
I have no say.

4392
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:46,500
I do not want the people angry at me.

4393
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:51,280
About making little missions for them to chop down the time.

4394
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:53,520
Every mission is a...

4395
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:54,540
Is a tape found.

4396
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:55,040
Yeah.

4397
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:55,400
Yeah.

4398
02:18:55,500 --> 02:19:01,300
Every mission you complete in this ARG, we find another tape.

4399
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:01,840
We...

4400
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:04,140
We just...

4401
02:19:04,140 --> 02:19:06,080
It just leads you to, like, a video.

4402
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,300
You complete the mission.

4403
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:10,640
A QR code shows up and you scan the QR code.

4404
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:13,580
And it leads you to a video recording of me finding that tape.

4405
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:19,660
That means you would have to...

4406
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:20,020
Oh, my God.

4407
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:21,200
The chat is red again.

4408
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,340
You're scaring me.

4409
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:24,440
I don't like this evil.

4410
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:25,700
Wait a minute.

4411
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,420
Wait.

4412
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:28,980
Someone said you could get a save file with all the tapes.

4413
02:19:29,380 --> 02:19:29,600
What?

4414
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:30,920
Wait, how?

4415
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:34,960
I copy a save file and move it to the game.

4416
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:38,320
And then I just start the game with all the...

4417
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:39,760
With all the tapes.

4418
02:19:40,020 --> 02:19:41,900
Like, hey guys, I just did this all off stream.

4419
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:45,460
Because I knew it would be so tedious to do it on stream for you guys.

4420
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:46,460
So...

4421
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:49,000
Well, you just gave away your evil plan.

4422
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:50,020
Yeah, but they didn't want to know.

4423
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:51,100
You didn't want to know.

4424
02:19:51,220 --> 02:19:52,100
It was just a joke.

4425
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:54,460
It was just imagination, you know?

4426
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:55,080
That's just...

4427
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:57,140
JK!

4428
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:00,280
Teehee!

4429
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:08,400
What if like, mint collects all...

4430
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,440
I'll give her my save file.

4431
02:20:09,460 --> 02:20:09,880
Oh my god!

4432
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:10,640
I'm not...

4433
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:11,520
I did not...

4434
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:13,840
I did not collect this stuff for charity!

4435
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:15,380
This is not...

4436
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:15,400
I...

4437
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:17,240
I give her my save file.

4438
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:18,460
If you both need this, I'm not...

4439
02:20:18,460 --> 02:20:19,600
I'm not going to...

4440
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:22,540
I am not going to be back next week.

4441
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:23,840
You can guarantee that.

4442
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:24,080
I know!

4443
02:20:24,260 --> 02:20:27,020
It's the scariest chapter, man!

4444
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:28,020
You can't do this!

4445
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:30,540
I was there for the entire play for a mortary assistant.

4446
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:32,000
I was there for all the endings!

4447
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:32,640
No, no, no!

4448
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,020
We only...

4449
02:20:34,020 --> 02:20:34,960
No, no, no!

4450
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:37,600
I was there for all the endings, man!

4451
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:39,340
You had to be there for...

4452
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:40,080
This is my...

4453
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,680
I'm cashing in my IOU.

4454
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:43,780
This is...

4455
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:48,120
This is...

4456
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:48,360
This is...

4457
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:48,520
This is...

4458
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:49,660
This is not my charity stream!

4459
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:51,120
Oh, you...

4460
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:52,640
Yours wasn't even doing it for charity!

4461
02:20:52,820 --> 02:20:53,860
You did it for fun!

4462
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:54,880
Yeah!

4463
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,200
I have no stakes!

4464
02:20:57,480 --> 02:20:58,340
You can't hold me!

4465
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:59,740
You can't hold this against me!

4466
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:00,200
That is...

4467
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:01,440
Min hates charity, too!

4468
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:02,780
What?!

4469
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:03,940
She hates charity!

4470
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:08,520
She won't do it out of the goodness of her own heart, because there's no good in that...

4471
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:17,540
There's a reason why she didn't go to heaven and is stuck in the ghost purgatory.

4472
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:19,120
And you think about it.

4473
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:19,880
The only reason...

4474
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:20,520
I did go to heaven!

4475
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:21,440
I just got kicked out!

4476
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:28,360
The only reason ghosts become ghosts is if they have unfinished business.

4477
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:31,220
It's a charity stream!

4478
02:21:31,420 --> 02:21:31,460
It's a charity stream!

4479
02:21:31,460 --> 02:21:31,760
It's a charity stream!

4480
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:32,400
Yeah, it's a charity stream!

4481
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:36,300
The moment you complete this, you can't go back to heaven!

4482
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:38,440
Don't...

4483
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:39,780
Don't make me come back!

4484
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,780
I mean, you could go downstairs if you want!

4485
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:50,720
Wait, so that means if we finish the game, then I...

4486
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,520
You go to hell!

4487
02:21:51,820 --> 02:21:53,040
I go to the light!

4488
02:21:54,300 --> 02:21:56,400
Yeah, go to the red light, Min!

4489
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:57,920
The red light!

4490
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:59,220
The red light!

4491
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:02,080
It's calling for you!

4492
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:03,820
It feels so warm!

4493
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:04,500
I feel...

4494
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:05,160
Warmly!

4495
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:05,880
Yeah, yeah!

4496
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:07,740
You don't have to feel cold anymore!

4497
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:08,860
You know?

4498
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:10,900
Yeah!

4499
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:14,180
Oh wait, what if you get, like, your new outfit is just...

4500
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:15,800
You go to hell!

4501
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:17,460
That's your new outfit!

4502
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:17,760
That's your new outfit!

4503
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:18,740
This is my hell-fit!

4504
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:21,040
I'm literally this on fire!

4505
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:23,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

4506
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:27,160
If you ever get a goth, mental outfit, it's just you in hell!

4507
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,800
I do have a goth outfit.

4508
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:31,360
Oh!

4509
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:34,020
Yeah, but you're still a ghost.

4510
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:39,520
You're still a ghost, though.

4511
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:41,320
So does it really count?

4512
02:22:43,460 --> 02:22:45,480
Oh my god, I like how you wear an RGB.

4513
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:49,260
You wear an RGB there for a sec.

4514
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:51,540
Yeah.

4515
02:22:52,580 --> 02:22:54,400
Wait, my ears don't match my head anymore.

4516
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:55,800
Yeah.

4517
02:22:56,320 --> 02:22:57,880
No, you're like those cats with like...

4518
02:22:57,880 --> 02:23:02,180
Like those like, the genetic defects where...

4519
02:23:02,180 --> 02:23:02,660
Ah!

4520
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:05,960
Is that actually the proper way to say it?

4521
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:07,380
Like genetic defects?

4522
02:23:07,660 --> 02:23:12,360
And then like there's like mutations where they're partially a different cat breed.

4523
02:23:14,500 --> 02:23:15,060
Calico?

4524
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:16,480
No, I don't know.

4525
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:17,100
There's like...

4526
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:26,580
There's like a thing where like some dogs and cats, or like some animals, they can like have like partial cat breeds or something.

4527
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:29,180
So like half the cat is like a different breed.

4528
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:31,880
Oh!

4529
02:23:32,420 --> 02:23:32,540
What?

4530
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:33,080
That's weird.

4531
02:23:33,260 --> 02:23:35,300
Yeah, no, I've seen like... Wait, let me see if I...

4532
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:35,860
Camaro?

4533
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:38,540
No, no, it's like... Okay.

4534
02:23:40,060 --> 02:23:40,460
Um...

4535
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:42,300
Different cats.

4536
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:44,000
Split cat breeds.

4537
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:46,480
I remember reading about it.

4538
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:48,340
Because it happens with dogs, too.

4539
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:52,520
Yeah, it's like... Oh yeah, that's how you get like labradoodles and things like that.

4540
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:53,880
Like this.

4541
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:56,820
Like, you know, someone...

4542
02:23:56,820 --> 02:23:59,860
They can be a black cat and a tabby cat at the same time.

4543
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:01,160
Oh!

4544
02:24:01,580 --> 02:24:01,740
Whoa!

4545
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:03,540
That's... This looks AI generated.

4546
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:07,060
No, it's... No, it's called... Oh wait, it's... It is a chimera cat.

4547
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:07,340
Yeah.

4548
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:09,560
Yeah, the chimera... It's a chimera cat.

4549
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:10,880
The... Meet Narnia.

4550
02:24:10,980 --> 02:24:13,760
The rare chimera cat that has a perfectly split face.

4551
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:15,600
They're so cute!

4552
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:18,060
Yeah, so you can get like... You can split them up.

4553
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:20,740
So you can like... One is like a tabby and one is the...

4554
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:23,000
Uh... One is like a black cat.

4555
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:25,440
And they can have different eye colors, too.

4556
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:27,200
I know it happens in dogs, too.

4557
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:27,340
Yeah, yeah.

4558
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:28,640
Oh, it is called a chimera cat.

4559
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:29,640
It is chimera.

4560
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:30,000
Whoa!

4561
02:24:30,260 --> 02:24:31,060
Oh, that's cool.

4562
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:33,260
I want a chimera cat.

4563
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:33,920
Cool.

4564
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:38,480
Yeah, you look like... You look like a chimera cat right there with your white and black ears.

4565
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:40,700
I am.

4566
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:42,160
Yeah, I'm just different species.

4567
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:45,100
Yeah, one is in heaven, the other is in hell.

4568
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,360
It's like the angel and the devil on your shoulder.

4569
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:50,420
I can be both.

4570
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:52,200
This is a picture for you.

4571
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:54,220
I could be your angle, or I could be your devil.

4572
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:57,060
This is... I feel like we're sort of the angel and devil.

4573
02:24:57,580 --> 02:24:59,380
But then we're like two devils instead.

4574
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:01,120
Yeah, we're just two devils.

4575
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,920
One gives you an even worse-tier option.

4576
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:08,780
Yeah, one gives you a bad option, one gives you the worst option.

4577
02:25:08,980 --> 02:25:11,000
One will be like, jump, come on, take the jump.

4578
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,960
And then I'll be like, do a flip while you jump.

4579
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:17,080
Yeah, do a flip while you jump.

4580
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:18,460
It'll be so cool.

4581
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:22,000
And look how cute they are.

4582
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:26,040
Yeah, I like the fact that different eye colors too.

4583
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:26,800
Yeah.

4584
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:27,880
That's really cute.

4585
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:30,300
But yeah, alright guys.

4586
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:33,300
I guess we'll see you at chapter 3 next week.

4587
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:34,540
Same time, same...

4588
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:36,320
Wait, actually I need to check my calendar.

4589
02:25:36,540 --> 02:25:36,900
Yeah, me too.

4590
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:37,820
I need to check my calendar.

4591
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:42,660
I think I have a sponsor at like at the 24th.

4592
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:45,860
So most likely whenever...

4593
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:48,360
I think my day's busiest is Thursday and Friday.

4594
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:49,380
So...

4595
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:50,460
Hello, dad.

4596
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:54,320
He's hungry.

4597
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:55,620
He's already ate.

4598
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:56,500
He can't be hungry.

4599
02:25:57,140 --> 02:25:58,060
I already fed him.

4600
02:25:58,980 --> 02:26:00,620
You're not allowed to be hungry.

4601
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:01,900
You're not allowed to be hungry.

4602
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:06,180
No hungry for you.

4603
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,680
Can you hear me?

4604
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:10,420
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.

4605
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:12,460
Speak, speak, speak, speak.

4606
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:16,380
No, I'm wearing headphones, you fucking idiot.

4607
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:19,880
What do you mean, can he hear me?

4608
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:23,040
If I'm loud enough, if I'm loud enough, he'll hear me.

4609
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:25,180
Mine is an ear-covered headphone.

4610
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:26,740
I'm not wearing open ear.

4611
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:29,800
Can he hear me?

4612
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:30,100
Dad!

4613
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:30,540
Dad!

4614
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:31,900
Can you hear me?

4615
02:26:34,140 --> 02:26:35,760
Please respond to me!

4616
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:36,380
You what?

4617
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,100
I want him to speak!

4618
02:26:38,420 --> 02:26:39,280
Can you make him speak?

4619
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:41,580
No, he only speaks if I have food.

4620
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:43,140
He doesn't care about anything.

4621
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:44,540
I can pretend to have food.

4622
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:47,100
Wait, let me see my vitamins.

4623
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:48,040
Yeah.

4624
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:49,620
Hello, you want vitamins?

4625
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:51,200
Hello?

4626
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:52,680
Hello?

4627
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:54,400
Yeah, it's too chill.

4628
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:55,520
All right, there you go.

4629
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:56,860
I have, like, toast.

4630
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:57,560
I tried to...

4631
02:26:57,560 --> 02:26:59,880
I ordered this from this new place that...

4632
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:01,300
You know those of those Korean sandwiches?

4633
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:02,880
Have you had one of those?

4634
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:05,840
Where it's, like, one giant slice of toast...

4635
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:09,000
And then they put, like, eggs and stuff on it as the toppings?

4636
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:10,740
No, I don't think so.

4637
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:11,900
It is so hard to eat.

4638
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:14,260
Like, because it's, like, fucking wide as fuck.

4639
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:15,440
And then, like...

4640
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:17,500
Come on, you want this?

4641
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:18,340
You want this?

4642
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:19,660
You won't get it until you bark.

4643
02:27:19,660 --> 02:27:20,320
Now you're just teasing him.

4644
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:22,020
Yeah, but that's the only way he'll bark.

4645
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,160
If I, like, don't get him through it.

4646
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:23,160
Really?

4647
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:25,160
He doesn't bark if you, like, bark at him?

4648
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:25,920
Or if he's a spear?

4649
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:26,840
No, I know.

4650
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:27,700
He doesn't.

4651
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:28,820
He doesn't care.

4652
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:30,040
You want this?

4653
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:32,420
I'm just gonna hold it, like, just above him.

4654
02:27:32,460 --> 02:27:33,620
I wanna hear him.

4655
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:36,380
Like, he'll bark eventually if I just hold it just above him.

4656
02:27:36,400 --> 02:27:38,640
Because he'll get frustrated that I'm not giving him food.

4657
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:40,000
You know what I mean?

4658
02:27:40,020 --> 02:27:41,380
Like, it's just there!

4659
02:27:41,720 --> 02:27:43,040
Yeah, I just need to make him mad.

4660
02:27:43,700 --> 02:27:44,060
Okay.

4661
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:45,220
Yeah, don't worry.

4662
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:45,940
As long as...

4663
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:47,320
Look, Mint wanted me to make him mad.

4664
02:27:47,540 --> 02:27:48,680
Like, so it's not my fault.

4665
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:49,660
She's the one that...

4666
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:51,640
She's the one that wants to make him mad.

4667
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:53,900
Yeah, I'm torturing you, Dad.

4668
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:54,460
Sorry.

4669
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:55,480
Alright, wait.

4670
02:27:55,980 --> 02:27:57,420
It's gonna be like, Daddy's angry.

4671
02:27:58,220 --> 02:27:58,780
Lucy.

4672
02:27:59,700 --> 02:28:00,800
Daddy's angry.

4673
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:03,960
I demand the food.

4674
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:05,440
I demand the bread.

4675
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:06,280
So it looks like...

4676
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:07,760
Basically, it looks like this.

4677
02:28:08,160 --> 02:28:08,620
Oh!

4678
02:28:09,020 --> 02:28:09,860
Yeah, but it's like...

4679
02:28:09,860 --> 02:28:10,200
Oh, it looks good.

4680
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:11,600
It is like...

4681
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:13,440
It depends on, like, where you order.

4682
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:15,440
But it's so fucking hard to eat, though.

4683
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:18,140
Because it's just, like...

4684
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:19,600
It's just so wide.

4685
02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:21,260
And, like, my mouth does not fit.

4686
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:22,760
Yeah, it looks like it would be difficult.

4687
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:25,520
Yeah, so, like, the toppings were, like, spilling out.

4688
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:26,140
I'll show it to chat.

4689
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:28,520
The toppings were, like, spilling out and everything.

4690
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:31,860
So I was, like, having the most difficult time trying to eat this.

4691
02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:33,220
Alright.

4692
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:33,840
Come on.

4693
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:34,300
Bark.

4694
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:35,900
I'll put this...

4695
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:36,480
Yum yum yum.

4696
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:37,640
Bark, come on.

4697
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:39,240
Are you angry yet?

4698
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:40,720
Are you mad?

4699
02:28:42,260 --> 02:28:42,940
He's not mad.

4700
02:28:42,940 --> 02:28:43,960
He's just looking at me.

4701
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:46,580
He's, like...

4702
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:47,320
Okay, next time.

4703
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:48,280
Next time, we'll get a...

4704
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:49,760
Alright, next time, we'll get in the bark.

4705
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:50,100
Yeah.

4706
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:53,500
Next time, I'll, like, make sure to, like...

4707
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:57,980
Okay, my dog, he, like, knows his schedule and everything.

4708
02:28:58,340 --> 02:28:59,960
So he knows exactly...

4709
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:08,720
So, when I'm doing, like, a 12-30 stream, and I stream a little too long, he, like, walks over and be, like, where's my food?

4710
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,860
He literally, like, reminds me to, like, feed him.

4711
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:17,200
And then he knows when I end stream.

4712
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:17,400
Yeah, he's hungry.

4713
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:19,380
He knows when I end stream, too.

4714
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:22,340
And then, like, when I'm, like, about to end stream, he, like, starts barking.

4715
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:24,480
He's, like, is it feeding time?

4716
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:28,780
Or, like, he also reminds me for, like, if I need to refill his water as well.

4717
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:29,980
Because I have those automatic...

4718
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:30,920
Yeah, because he's thirsty!

4719
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:33,100
Automatic water dispensers.

4720
02:29:33,300 --> 02:29:37,980
So the moment the water is empty, he, like, walks over and be, like, Water now!

4721
02:29:38,700 --> 02:29:38,940
Water!

4722
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:41,600
Water is empty!

4723
02:29:45,220 --> 02:29:46,200
He's so smart.

4724
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:47,040
Yeah, yeah.

4725
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:48,300
He, like, wakes me up, too.

4726
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:50,420
He's, like, it's feeding time!

4727
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:50,940
You know?

4728
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:51,340
Oh, yeah.

4729
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:52,580
Because I know, like, cats do that.

4730
02:29:52,700 --> 02:29:54,920
Cats will make sure you don't breathe.

4731
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,060
Like, they sit on you, right?

4732
02:29:57,140 --> 02:29:58,200
Oh, it depends on the cat.

4733
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:01,580
No, my cat, he just scratches the door until I wake up.

4734
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:04,160
And then he runs away when I get him to...

4735
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:07,100
He'll just scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch.

4736
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:07,920
Food.

4737
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:10,080
Yeah, yeah, he's like, food now.

4738
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:10,940
Food now.

4739
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:16,560
Or if he's in my bed and I'm sleeping and my hand is by my head, he'll eat my fingers.

4740
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:17,380
What?

4741
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:19,440
He'll eat your fingers?

4742
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:23,000
Yeah, he'll bite my fingers trying to get me to...

4743
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,520
I don't know if he's trying to eat me or if he's trying to...

4744
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:26,540
He's trying to bore you?

4745
02:30:28,140 --> 02:30:28,720
I'm done.

4746
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:29,360
I'm leaving.

4747
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:30,580
I'm leaving this stream.

4748
02:30:31,700 --> 02:30:32,860
See you next week.

4749
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:41,460
You know, like, if you die and, like, and your cat is, like, like, I heard that, like, uh, your pets will eat you if you're dead.

4750
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:42,940
Yeah, I heard that, too.

4751
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:44,680
Because it's just free food to them.

4752
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:46,080
I would let them.

4753
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:48,920
I mean, I don't want them to starve, you know?

4754
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:49,600
Yeah, exactly.

4755
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:51,240
Yeah, because, like, I live alone.

4756
02:30:51,240 --> 02:30:52,660
Like, who's going to feed my dog?

4757
02:30:53,180 --> 02:30:54,000
Don't think about it.

4758
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:54,580
That's so sad.

4759
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:56,500
Don't think about that.

4760
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:57,280
That's so sad.

4761
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:07,800
So, like, so, you know, I want my dog to be able to feed him, so I give consent.

4762
02:31:08,260 --> 02:31:15,300
This is the stream where, like, if a news article publishes an article where my dog eats my face after, like...

4763
02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:16,700
It's consensual.

4764
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:17,780
It's consensual.

4765
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:19,940
I gave him permission.

4766
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:22,280
He's not a bad dog.

4767
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:24,180
He was just trying to survive.

4768
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:26,760
I mean, if you're dead, who cares?

4769
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:27,840
Yeah, who cares?

4770
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,220
As long as I'm...

4771
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:31,820
I mean, I'm a ghost already, so...

4772
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:32,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4773
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:34,100
I get to be one with my dog, that's fine.

4774
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:37,980
I don't think many...

4775
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:38,480
I don't think...

4776
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:39,440
I think you might want to...

4777
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:40,560
Wait, wait, okay, wait.

4778
02:31:40,580 --> 02:31:42,420
I live on through my dog.

4779
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:45,360
I live on through him.

4780
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:53,540
I'm going to leave you and let you digest that with your chat.

4781
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:54,280
And...

4782
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:55,240
Yeah.

4783
02:31:56,060 --> 02:31:56,860
You have fun.

4784
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:57,540
You know what I said?

4785
02:31:57,560 --> 02:31:59,180
You let your cat eat you, too.

4786
02:31:59,980 --> 02:32:01,440
Yeah, but I did not say that.

4787
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:03,200
I was going to become one with my cat.

4788
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:08,920
Don't you want your cat to live on through...

4789
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:11,280
Don't you want to live on through your cat?

4790
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:14,160
Bye, dookie!

4791
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:17,520
Alright, I'll see you next week, man.

4792
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:18,700
See you next week!

4793
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:19,360
Bye, bye!

4794
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:19,980
Bye, bye!

4795
02:32:25,780 --> 02:32:27,180
Alright, everybody.

4796
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:30,260
I'm glad that chapter was easier.

4797
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:31,340
Because...

4798
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:32,560
This game's fucked up.

4799
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:34,140
This game.

4800
02:32:34,500 --> 02:32:35,180
But...

4801
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:36,560
I'm also not happy...

4802
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:38,240
That I...

4803
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:40,860
Left the hardest chapter for last.

4804
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:43,720
Because chapter 3 is the last chapter, as we all know.

4805
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:47,040
So, I guess...

4806
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:50,580
I'll see you guys next week for chapter 3 for the...

4807
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:51,340
I'm like...

4808
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:53,520
Oh my god, of course it's the grandma chapter, too.

4809
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:55,140
So...

4810
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:57,320
Of course the grandma chapter is going to be the hardest.

4811
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:59,120
Like, the elderly is so scary.

4812
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:00,340
Like, they don't...

4813
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:02,040
They have, like, the...

4814
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:02,280
The...

4815
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:03,000
The...

4816
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,420
Like, you know, the old people's strength.

4817
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:07,000
Where they don't know how strong they are because they're old.

4818
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:09,260
Because they can't, like, limit test anymore.

4819
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:11,060
So, like, it's either...

4820
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:14,000
It's either, like, they're super strong or they're weak as hell.

4821
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:14,940
Uh...

4822
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:15,460
No, of course...

4823
02:33:15,460 --> 02:33:15,640
Yeah!

4824
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:16,880
Those people are...

4825
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:19,440
Like, the elderly are a little scary.

4826
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:21,480
Because, like, they don't know their own strength.

4827
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:22,060
Like...

4828
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:27,320
So...

4829
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:27,660
So...

4830
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:28,440
So I'm a little...

4831
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:30,880
I'm a little scared about chapter 3.

4832
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,480
And I read that it also has the hardest puzzles.

4833
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:37,240
I feel like we sort of already struggled enough in the Lucy chapter.

4834
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:38,480
For puzzles.

4835
02:33:38,780 --> 02:33:39,400
Like, we...

4836
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:43,100
Min and I, we both share, like, one singular brain cell.

4837
02:33:43,240 --> 02:33:45,840
And I think Min has, like, 0.9 of that.

4838
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:48,320
She has...

4839
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:52,440
She has 0.9 of that singular brain cell.

4840
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:55,300
So it's gonna be rough.

4841
02:33:55,820 --> 02:33:59,180
Lucy's chapter was more so because, like...

4842
02:33:59,180 --> 02:34:02,520
I was being chased by two things in Lucy's chapter.

4843
02:34:02,780 --> 02:34:04,840
Because it was, like, the fucking ghost.

4844
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:08,920
And then, like, there was Lucy and her, like, little demon friend.

4845
02:34:08,980 --> 02:34:11,560
So, like, I feel like that's what made it really hard.

4846
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:12,360
Because she was...

4847
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:12,680
What?

4848
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:13,520
What does that say?

4849
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:15,280
It's, like, behind her...

4850
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:17,520
What did she write there?

4851
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,020
I hate the guy...

4852
02:34:19,020 --> 02:34:21,180
The item is, like, behind her hair.

4853
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:21,940
Like...

4854
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:29,040
I did not know her forehead was that big, guys.

4855
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,680
If you, like, lift her...

4856
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:31,340
Um...

4857
02:34:31,340 --> 02:34:34,160
There's something wrong with her.

4858
02:34:35,580 --> 02:34:38,120
If you lift up her forehead...

4859
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:38,680
That her...

4860
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:39,260
Her...

4861
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:40,520
Her...

4862
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:42,100
Her...

4863
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:42,640
Her...

4864
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:44,520
Her...

4865
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:45,300
Her bangs...

4866
02:34:45,300 --> 02:34:45,840
Like...

4867
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:47,500
Like, you can find the...

4868
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:49,980
If you lift her bangs up...

4869
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:53,120
You'll find the entire novel of Moby Dick underneath there.

4870
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:54,240
That's written down there.

4871
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:54,940
Um...

4872
02:34:54,940 --> 02:34:55,840
Push...

4873
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:57,500
Yeah, you push back her bangs.

4874
02:34:57,660 --> 02:35:01,560
It's an entire novelization of Moby Dick.

4875
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:03,380
Oh, my God!

4876
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:05,940
I can have ad space on there.

4877
02:35:06,300 --> 02:35:09,180
Mint, get a toggle where you can lift up your bangs...

4878
02:35:09,180 --> 02:35:11,780
So I can advertise something beneath your bangs.

4879
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:13,360
Like, I can put...

4880
02:35:13,360 --> 02:35:14,020
I can...

4881
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:17,900
Let me put my gamer subcode underneath your bangs.

4882
02:35:21,180 --> 02:35:22,500
I'll buy ads.

4883
02:35:22,580 --> 02:35:24,080
I'll pay you for ad space.

4884
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:25,660
If you have that.

4885
02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:30,660
Oh, you...

4886
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:32,160
She's missing out on the barks!

4887
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:33,600
He's barking now.

4888
02:35:33,700 --> 02:35:34,300
He's frustrated.

4889
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:35,860
You wanted more food.

4890
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:37,280
Yeah.

4891
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:37,880
Oh, my God!

4892
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:39,700
That's where one of the ARG is!

4893
02:35:39,980 --> 02:35:40,480
That's...

4894
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:42,820
One of the...

4895
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:45,800
Have a QR code underneath her bangs.

4896
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:48,580
Just lift it up so you can scan the QR code.

4897
02:35:48,820 --> 02:35:49,820
Oh, my God!

4898
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:50,300
I'm...

4899
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:51,360
I'm cooking right now.

4900
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:54,320
I'm actually cooking with some great ideas.

4901
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:56,360
Like, imagine...

4902
02:35:56,360 --> 02:35:58,560
You lift it up and there's a QR code.

4903
02:36:01,660 --> 02:36:03,500
Where will it lead you?

4904
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:05,940
It'll lead you to an ARG.

4905
02:36:14,710 --> 02:36:17,470
Let me buy ad space on your head.

4906
02:36:18,450 --> 02:36:19,670
Honestly, that is like...

4907
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:21,490
That should be the next like...

4908
02:36:22,410 --> 02:36:27,230
I'm cooking up like ways for sponsors to use VTubers for advertisement.

4909
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:29,570
You can just buy ad space on our body.

4910
02:36:32,310 --> 02:36:33,510
Like, you know how like...

4911
02:36:33,510 --> 02:36:35,170
You know how like flesh...

4912
02:36:35,170 --> 02:36:36,330
Flesh Tubers...

4913
02:36:36,330 --> 02:36:37,410
They like sit on...

4914
02:36:37,410 --> 02:36:37,870
Like they're...

4915
02:36:37,870 --> 02:36:39,790
They have like those like cameras and everything.

4916
02:36:39,990 --> 02:36:40,890
And they're in their background.

4917
02:36:40,890 --> 02:36:42,210
It's like ad space and stuff.

4918
02:36:42,350 --> 02:36:43,450
Like, you know, they put like the...

4919
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:45,510
The Red Bull fridge and everything.

4920
02:36:45,970 --> 02:36:46,930
The Red Bull fridge.

4921
02:36:46,930 --> 02:36:48,410
The gaming chair.

4922
02:36:48,570 --> 02:36:49,410
What they're advertising.

4923
02:36:49,790 --> 02:36:52,190
And then the background is like all their advertisements and stuff.

4924
02:36:52,550 --> 02:36:54,390
So like for us, you can literally just...

4925
02:36:54,390 --> 02:36:55,210
We're like a NASCAR.

4926
02:36:55,390 --> 02:36:56,110
Oh my god!

4927
02:36:56,130 --> 02:36:57,370
You can NASCAR us!

4928
02:36:57,530 --> 02:37:00,850
We can just buy ad space on us.

4929
02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:02,450
And then we just have like...

4930
02:37:02,450 --> 02:37:05,410
We have like a Red Bull stick...

4931
02:37:05,410 --> 02:37:07,810
Like we have like a picture of a Red Bull...

4932
02:37:08,370 --> 02:37:09,390
On our face.

4933
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:12,270
Like a Red Bull tattoo on our cheeks or something.

4934
02:37:12,810 --> 02:37:14,430
On our face cheeks.

4935
02:37:14,430 --> 02:37:18,150
And like a Formula One race car.

4936
02:37:18,350 --> 02:37:18,810
Yeah.

4937
02:37:18,970 --> 02:37:19,430
Yeah.

4938
02:37:19,430 --> 02:37:21,730
Put on some temporary tattoo.

4939
02:37:22,290 --> 02:37:22,850
Ka-chow.

4940
02:37:23,450 --> 02:37:24,750
We gotta ka-chow it up.

4941
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:25,930
Yeah.

4942
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:27,050
I'm cooking.

4943
02:37:27,370 --> 02:37:27,850
I'm like...

4944
02:37:27,850 --> 02:37:30,730
I'm revolutionizing VTuber ad space.

4945
02:37:31,590 --> 02:37:34,870
How much are you charging ad space?

4946
02:37:35,010 --> 02:37:36,750
We're like a New York billboard.

4947
02:37:40,290 --> 02:37:44,490
We'll be your New York billboard out in Times Square.

4948
02:37:45,890 --> 02:37:46,870
Hooter tattoo.

4949
02:37:47,130 --> 02:37:48,410
When Hooters went bankrupt!

4950
02:37:49,070 --> 02:37:49,310
Guys.

4951
02:37:49,650 --> 02:37:50,570
Rest in peace Hooters.

4952
02:37:50,870 --> 02:37:52,070
Who would've thought...

4953
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:52,950
Girls...

4954
02:37:54,050 --> 02:37:56,790
Hot ladies serving you chicken wings...

4955
02:37:56,790 --> 02:37:59,270
Hot wings was not the right business move.

4956
02:37:59,470 --> 02:38:00,590
Who would've thought...

4957
02:38:00,590 --> 02:38:02,970
Society is crumbling now, guys.

4958
02:38:03,290 --> 02:38:06,310
We are at a point where Hooters is now going bankrupt.

4959
02:38:06,310 --> 02:38:07,390
Like, what else...

4960
02:38:07,390 --> 02:38:08,370
What do we have now?

4961
02:38:08,910 --> 02:38:09,270
What...

4962
02:38:09,270 --> 02:38:12,050
They had a good run.

4963
02:38:14,450 --> 02:38:15,370
Hey, guys.

4964
02:38:15,510 --> 02:38:16,830
I'm gonna call it here.

4965
02:38:17,030 --> 02:38:18,550
Next week, we will do...

4966
02:38:18,550 --> 02:38:19,870
Chapter 3.

4967
02:38:20,290 --> 02:38:22,530
And then Chapter 4 will be ARG.

4968
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:27,470
I'll think about what the fate of Chapter 4...

4969
02:38:27,470 --> 02:38:30,430
I'll decide what happens to Chapter 4...

4970
02:38:30,430 --> 02:38:32,430
When we finish Chapter 3, guys.

4971
02:38:32,910 --> 02:38:33,210
Hey!

4972
02:38:33,210 --> 02:38:34,670
As always, everybody...

4973
02:38:34,670 --> 02:38:35,630
Stay hydrated.

4974
02:38:35,910 --> 02:38:36,510
Posture check.

4975
02:38:36,750 --> 02:38:37,710
Get up and move around...

4976
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:38,650
To get that blood flowing.

4977
02:38:38,810 --> 02:38:40,010
And if you still for me...

4978
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:40,730
Head to bed.

4979
02:38:41,050 --> 02:38:41,490
Because...

4980
02:38:41,490 --> 02:38:42,270
You deserve it.

4981
02:38:42,430 --> 02:38:43,790
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4982
02:38:44,190 --> 02:38:44,950
Bye, guys.

4983
02:38:45,290 --> 02:38:45,730
Bye.

4984
02:38:45,910 --> 02:38:46,350
Bye.

4985
02:38:48,030 --> 02:38:48,470
Bye.
