387
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:51,290
Hello.

388
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:52,770
Oh!

389
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,610
Oh my.

390
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,690
Hello.

391
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,170
Hello.

392
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,790
I am the most unluckiest player in the world.

393
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:00,630
Listen.

394
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,750
Listen.

395
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,330
Listen.

396
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:01,630
Listen.

397
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,170
Life hands in lemons.

398
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,590
We're gonna make some lemonade.

399
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,790
We can get this done.

400
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,050
Don't worry.

401
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:07,610
Hello Dokie.

402
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,310
How are you?

403
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:08,770
Hello.

404
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,930
I am very tired but hello.

405
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,050
Okay!

406
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,550
Okay!

407
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,670
Nice to meet you.

408
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,430
Nice to meet you as well.

409
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,730
Nice to meet you as well.

410
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,870
I see you've been doing a little bit of secret training though in the meantime.

411
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,190
Is that correct?

412
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:32,930
If by secret training you mean playing rank for five hours at degen hours then yeah I I guess... I don't know what I'm doing.

413
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:33,910
I...

414
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,030
No, that's perfect.

415
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,850
That's how we all start.

416
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,770
But I'm here to make it so you know what you're doing.

417
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,150
Maybe... maybe slightly.

418
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,610
Or maybe we don't want to know.

419
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,530
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

420
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,690
I'm trying to figure out, like, how much you want to know.

421
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:51,510
Like, how much do you want to open your third eye, versus kind of... just go at it raw.

422
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,510
Like, I'm trying to understand what you're thinking here.

423
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,490
I just... I just don't want to get absolute destroyed.

424
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,270
That's... that's really it.

425
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,810
I just don't want to be the worst player in my division.

426
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:09,230
As long as I'm better than, like, at least one person, then I'm happy.

427
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:14,710
You know, if you pick, like, a target, I can try to, like, figure out exactly how you can beat them.

428
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:20,610
Because the thing is, at your level, in, like, the beginner tier, sometimes being the worst player will make you win the most.

429
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,390
You know what I'm saying?

430
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,930
It's a little...

431
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,270
It's kind of like a weird topsy-turvy land that you're in right now.

432
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,390
So I'm trying to figure out...

433
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,730
how we're going to approach this.

434
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,490
And so I think I need to know a little bit about what you know now.

435
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,490
Well, I just want to do...

436
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:34,750
And then we can go from there.

437
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,210
I want to...

438
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,550
Well, what I know?

439
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,070
Okay.

440
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,730
That's a very good question.

441
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,470
I don't even know what I know.

442
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:43,610
I've just been...

443
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,770
Because, like, BrawlPro is, like, secondhand coaching me.

444
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,050
Because I usually play at, like, degen hours.

445
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,170
So, like, starting at, like, 11 p.m., that's when I usually play.

446
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,430
Are you...

447
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:54,990
And then he was, like...

448
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,050
He's been, like, dropping knowledge down.

449
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:57,370
Like...

450
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,630
Funneling your knowledge to him.

451
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,670
And then he's been funneling the knowledge to me.

452
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,090
I'm scared of what he's filtering to you.

453
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,830
And then...

454
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,630
He tried to coach me last night.

455
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,150
And, like, I'm just, like...

456
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,850
And then I showed him...

457
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,290
Because he was watching me play ranked.

458
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:23,250
And then the thing is, in the elo I was in, I was doing the most, like, super bad habit stuff.

459
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,470
Because, like, he was, like, you can't do that again.

460
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,130
So the other...

461
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,290
I mean, so...

462
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,690
But, like, I'm winning, so...

463
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:33,470
That might not be true.

464
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:33,770
That might not be true.

465
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,390
That's what I'm wondering.

466
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,110
See, I feel like he's trying to set you, like...

467
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:46,170
There's a difference between giving you the fundamentals that will help you win in the long run versus we need to win tomorrow and you need to abuse the fact that they're all also new.

468
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,090
You know what I mean?

469
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:47,810
Yeah, yeah.

470
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:54,170
Like, you can win right now by doing really bad habits that new players will not be able to stop.

471
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:54,990
Yeah.

472
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,870
And if you're okay with that...

473
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:55,970
And if you're okay with that...

474
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:56,810
That's how I climbed.

475
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:02,110
I've just been doing... because I was doing that... what was it?

476
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:08,630
The back triangle thing where he just runs at you and grabs and then you players don't know what the fuck to do.

477
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,670
So I just kept doing that.

478
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,770
And I got like a seven game win streak by just doing that.

479
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:18,310
And then obviously the moment I got to bronze, they realized they can jump.

480
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,990
So I was like, okay, now what else can I abuse to climb out of bronze?

481
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,230
No, that's good.

482
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,030
I like the mentality.

483
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,350
Yeah, that running bear grab, it's good.

484
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,570
And we can get a little even trickier with it.

485
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,310
That was one of the things I wrote in that guide to do.

486
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:40,050
We can get a little bit of... use some normals into it, like your square button into that at certain ranges.

487
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,150
And it's even trickier.

488
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,110
But all we got to do is abuse that.

489
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,710
And then if they're jumping it, then we need to go to the next plan.

490
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,810
So we can keep that as part of the main plan because there's a chance they won't know what to do.

491
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:52,810
Yeah.

492
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:53,390
Definitely a chance.

493
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,550
And then it's really funny because like Brawl Pro is on Classic.

494
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:04,030
So like, because I do like those like every time, because apparently Classic is like super fucking hard for Zangief.

495
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,410
And then he would see me do like the jump triangle.

496
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,950
And he's like, how do you do that?

497
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,450
And I was like, I don't know, let's do buttons.

498
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,610
I just, it's a jump triangle.

499
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,870
So you're doing the, that's the grab, right?

500
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,510
Like you're jumping in the air and grabbing them?

501
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,370
Yeah, like when they jump, I just grab them.

502
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,090
Okay.

503
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,970
And he says like...

504
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,310
Like, it's very hard to do that.

505
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,810
And I was just like, you just jump.

506
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,790
Well, Brawl Pro is just kind of a scrub.

507
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,750
So I mean, I wouldn't, I just wouldn't worry about anything he says.

508
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:30,870
It's really two buttons for me.

509
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:31,730
Yeah, don't worry.

510
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:32,750
Don't worry.

511
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:33,950
We'll set the record straight.

512
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,890
So anyways, yeah, that's good.

513
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,330
So you understand the concept of anti-airing with that?

514
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,110
Yeah.

515
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:41,610
Okay.

516
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,890
Do you have any recorded matches actually right now?

517
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,310
Yeah, I mean, well, I have replays, so...

518
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,330
Well, the CFN is down.

519
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,830
Like, you mean replays in the game?

520
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,090
Or do you have like anything?

521
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,530
No, I thought you... you can't access replay when it's maintenance?

522
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:57,470
Maybe.

523
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,030
Do you want to try?

524
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,170
Yeah, I'll check.

525
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:04,830
And then you can... maybe... are you... can you share your screen when you do that?

526
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,130
Yeah.

527
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:05,370
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,690
So if I can just see like a game where you're doing things, I can get a feel for what's going on.

529
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,630
All right.

530
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,430
Is it CFN?

531
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,230
Oh, no.

532
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:15,670
It won't let you?

533
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,770
It just says local replays.

534
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,970
Okay, we'll make do.

535
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,670
So why don't we just have you go to training mode and then share your screen?

536
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:22,970
Okay.

537
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:22,970
We'll make do.

538
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:22,970
So why don't we just have you go to training mode and then share your screen?

539
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:23,130
Okay.

540
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:23,130
We'll make do.

541
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:23,130
So why don't we just have you go to training mode and then share your screen?

542
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,070
And then you can just tell me a bit more about kind of what your... what your favorite moves are.

543
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,830
And we can go from there.

544
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,090
All right.

545
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,550
I'm going to go to training.

546
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,230
I wonder if like Brob... no, I don't think Brob will record any.

547
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,970
He records his own stuff, not me.

548
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,870
Uh, did you have a VOD?

549
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,550
Did you stream any of these matches at any point?

550
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:42,750
What?

551
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:43,430
No, I didn't.

552
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,110
I was just screen sharing for him.

553
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:45,630
Okay.

554
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,060
So yeah, I mean, you got... you understand the command grab and you understand anti-airs.

555
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:58,920
So...

556
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,880
That's like 70% of the game plan, I feel like.

557
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,540
Did you use DI at all?

558
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,560
That's going to be the L1 button.

559
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,740
The DI.

560
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:08,660
Wait, what's DI?

561
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,320
Is DI...

562
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,600
Oh, he has this!

563
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah.

564
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,220
Slap.

565
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,360
The red thing, right?

566
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,000
Uh, yes.

567
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Sorry, that's my dog.

568
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:19,720
He's angry.

569
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:21,980
That's okay.

570
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:22,920
What's your dog's name?

571
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,860
Oh, his name is Doki.

572
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,840
But like, I don't call him Doki on stream.

573
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,460
Because that's confusing.

574
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,700
Yeah, that sounds confusing actually.

575
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:31,580
Okay.

576
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,060
Okay.

577
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,220
Hello Doki.

578
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:36,700
Okay.

579
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,980
So yeah, the L1 is the Armored... the armored move.

580
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,840
Have you tried spamming that a bunch at all?

581
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,300
Like the armored move?

582
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:50,920
Oh, this?

583
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,420
Yeah, so I'm calling it an armored move Oh, yeah, I rebinded it because I kept... I rebinded that to R1.

584
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,140
Okay.

585
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,240
Oh.

586
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:05,140
Because I kept accidentally pressing parry instead, so like, I binded parry to L1, because it's pretty away from me.

587
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,020
You swapped them.

588
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:06,260
Okay.

589
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:13,940
Yeah, that move, if you haven't thrown it out a bunch, it's definitely really good against newer players, because it can absorb multiple hits.

590
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So if they're trying to punch you a bunch, hit you a bunch, that move can just blow through all their attacks.

591
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,820
And when it does that, it'll do like a big slowdown.

592
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:28,380
So if you do it right now in training mode and you hit them, it doesn't do the effect, because he's not getting hit out of a move.

593
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,520
But normally, it'll do like this big, super slowdown.

594
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:37,780
And so that move was really good to press, just kind of like when you guys are feeling each other out, in neutral, like pressing buttons.

595
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:44,100
Just press that button, if they're pressuring you too much, and you'll probably smack them super hard.

596
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,120
And when it does that, you can press triangle, and you'll be able to combo into your grab.

597
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,960
Oh yeah, I've been doing that in rank.

598
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,280
Yeah.

599
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,160
Okay, so you do know about that.

600
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,680
Yeah, that's good.

601
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,040
It's gonna be super, super common.

602
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,940
And if they're doing that against you, the thing about that move, like the counter it, it's a universal move.

603
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,040
You also press that button in return if they're doing it to you.

604
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:13,760
So I feel like your opponents, this is gonna be a common strategy, like using DI and countering DI is gonna be the main thing.

605
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,920
So if someone also presses that move against you, you can react to that move in turn.

606
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,540
And then also it'll give you the combo where you can just mash your triangle after.

607
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,560
So getting familiar with that is gonna be really valuable.

608
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,960
So you can spam it against people, and if they're not ready for it, just keep spamming it and then keep pressing triangle.

609
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:37,100
And if they're spamming it against you, you can also react to it and press it in turn.

610
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,680
So that move is gonna be super valuable, I think.

611
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,280
The coaches will probably tell the other players how to counter that, but it's still worth throwing out.

612
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,480
Yeah.

613
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,340
So what are some of your other favorite moves that you've been messing with?

614
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,520
Well, like I said, usually I just do this to start it off.

615
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:01,600
And then if they don't counter it, I just keep doing that until they learn how to jump or like, grapple me.

616
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:08,760
And then when they start throwing it, cause like, the only way, I feel like the only way to stop it, cause I got stuck in throw loops when I kept spamming this at people.

617
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,280
And then Brawl Pro told me, like, all I had to do was throw them back.

618
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,000
So if they start throwing, I just do this to them.

619
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,560
Or like this.

620
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,320
Exactly.

621
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,760
If they throw loop me.

622
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:28,540
And then if the back triangle doesn't work, I just like, what do I do?

623
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,540
I don't even remember.

624
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,580
I abuse this a lot too.

625
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,340
Especially when they're jumping.

626
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,280
So when they get close to me, they're jumping a lot.

627
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,340
Cause like, because I keep doing this.

628
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,600
So they start jumping a lot.

629
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,880
And then after they start jumping a lot, I just abuse the spinny spin.

630
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,300
And then, and then after that, I don't, after that it's just a wild card.

631
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:55,580
I mean, sometimes I do this sometimes, sometimes I head butt.

632
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,520
And then if I have a three, then I can do my...

633
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,160
Okay.

634
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,620
So you know about the auto combo?

635
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,280
Yeah.

636
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:01,540
Yeah.

637
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,320
Okay, cool.

638
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,420
I mean, I mean what you mentioned right there, that's a very structured game plan already, right?

639
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,660
Like the, the down triangle, his lariat, that stops people out of the air.

640
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,780
You're going for grabs, which they have to jump.

641
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,080
And then if they go in the air, you do that.

642
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,000
So yeah, that makes, that's a solid game plan already.

643
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,460
Do you find yourself like mashing a lot?

644
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,100
Like, are you in that phase where you're kinda like panicking and sometimes you just start mashing random buttons?

645
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,760
Does that happen?

646
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:36,480
Well, I used to, and then I realized this game does not do mashing very well, and I was like, oh man, you actually have to think.

647
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,780
You actually have to think in this game so I can't actually mash my buttons.

648
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,220
It's debatable but, yeah sometimes.

649
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:50,580
Cause every time I try to mash my buttons like, I can't do anything, even in bronze, So, I was like, okay, I'll just abuse moves that I actually know.

650
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,760
So, I try not to mash for this game just because I feel like it's more detrimental than it is helping me.

651
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,100
Yeah, that's kind of true for most situations.

652
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:10,520
I will say the one thing I would encourage you to mash if people are doing a bit too much pressure on you.

653
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,400
Besides the DI, which I mentioned, you should throw that out every once in a while.

654
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,640
It would also be your square button while crouching.

655
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:26,680
So, that move is good to stop people from walking you down and from constantly approaching you.

656
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,620
That's going to be one of your fastest buttons.

657
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:37,160
And if people are pressing buttons and walking up and doing more things or running at you, that's going to be the button that you say, hey, we'll slow down a little bit.

658
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,180
And then you can at least go back to some kind of control.

659
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,660
And you see what it does.

660
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:48,480
As moves hit like that, you did like three of the squares or two or three depending on how close you are.

661
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,800
And then it pushes you too far away.

662
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,580
That's a common concept in this game.

663
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,800
Like if people do too many attacks in a row, it pushes you away.

664
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,840
And so, a good thing to understand is like what you can do at that range.

665
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:08,860
So, if you check them with the three squares and then it pushes to that range, then what's the next thing you can do?

666
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,160
And I think the next thing for you to do is going to be your head...

667
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:13,700
Oh, whoa.

668
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,440
Yeah, that's an option.

669
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:16,900
Okay.

670
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,240
That's an option.

671
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,800
I was going to say press heavy punch, but you have dry brush SPD.

672
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah.

673
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,200
Like usually I just do that on repeat too.

674
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,380
That's good.

675
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,940
I kept doing that, but it'll hit.

676
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,240
Okay.

677
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,400
Until they learn to jump.

678
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,980
And then after they learn to jump, I just do this.

679
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:39,800
Right.

680
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,760
No, that's perfect.

681
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,980
Perfect.

682
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,260
So, one other option to mix in there, which will be...

683
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,340
It'll help make the dry brush triangle, the big grab.

684
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:55,160
It'll make that more effective is if you're at that range, like after the three squares, press heavy, which is the big punch.

685
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,540
And you can tap that or charge it because it has armor if you charge it.

686
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,520
So, that's another move to like say, hey, stop moving, stop doing things.

687
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,240
Right?

688
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,460
So, that move will make them a little bit scared to move and do any actions.

689
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:08,820
Yeah.

690
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,580
And when they're scared to move...

691
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:11,960
Yeah.

692
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:12,640
Like that one.

693
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:12,940
Perfect.

694
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:21,120
When they're scared to move, that's when that dry brush command grab that you did, the dry brush triangle, that's when that becomes super good because they're like, oh crap, I got a block.

695
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,620
Then you just dry brush in and grab them.

696
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,400
Okay.

697
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,980
So, mixing after those three jabs, mix between heavy punch or the...

698
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,460
Oh, sorry.

699
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,540
Mix between X or your dry brush triangle.

700
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,120
That's a...

701
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,400
Okay.

702
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,520
You got a mix up right there.

703
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,360
That's a mix up.

704
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,420
Yeah.

705
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,060
They're guessing between two options right away.

706
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,300
Yeah.

707
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:39,780
Yeah.

708
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,320
Sweet.

709
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,100
Do you jump at your opponents at all?

710
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:44,680
No.

711
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,600
Do you ever use any jumping attacks?

712
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,300
Oh, I mean, if they fucking high duking, yeah.

713
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,040
Okay.

714
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,300
If they start high duking and then after that, I just...

715
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:50,620
Oh, wait.

716
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,580
After that, I start doing this.

717
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,420
Yeah.

718
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,040
That one's good.

719
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,540
If I get closer enough.

720
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:55,720
But like...

721
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,860
From further away, you want to use the jump square.

722
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,500
That's going to be your best jump in from further away.

723
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,800
Oh.

724
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:03,700
Oh.

725
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,940
Oh, sorry.

726
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,300
I'm sorry.

727
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:05,400
Sorry.

728
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:05,880
Jump X.

729
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,360
My bad.

730
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,220
Oh, jump X.

731
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,600
I'm trying to translate for myself.

732
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,440
I'm looking at my controller here to read the place.

733
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:11,860
To jump away?

734
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,080
That would be the jump at them.

735
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,740
Oh, jump at them.

736
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,080
Okay.

737
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,280
So that...

738
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,860
From a further distance, press the button a little later.

739
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,220
Yeah.

740
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,460
The big boot.

741
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,660
It hits pretty low.

742
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:29,100
So, if you're like there, that perfect jump distance, that's when you use jump X.

743
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,020
So, you wait till you get close enough.

744
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,360
Perfect.

745
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,120
And you can do that.

746
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,800
But when you're really close, this is one thing I think you can spam.

747
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,520
So, like walk into Jamie's face here.

748
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
Like walk into your opponent's face.

749
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,640
And then you're going to do a jump forward.

750
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,380
And then you're going to do the splash.

751
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,000
The down plus heavy.

752
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,340
Or down plus...

753
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,520
What button is it?

754
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,380
Down plus X.

755
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:52,740
No.

756
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,400
Down plus circle.

757
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,680
Sorry.

758
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,880
I'm trying to remember these controls.

759
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,540
Yeah.

760
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:55,920
Okay.

761
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:56,460
This?

762
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:57,960
No.

763
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,580
While you're in the air, that moves.

764
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:00,720
Oh, the splash.

765
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,240
Oh, this one.

766
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:01,560
Okay.

767
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,180
So, walk all the way up into his grill.

768
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,660
Like get all on his face and then do it.

769
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,400
And then press the jump in a little later.

770
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,020
Press the down plus circle.

771
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,340
Yeah.

772
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,720
See how you landed on the other side?

773
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,100
You can keep doing that back and forth on either side over and over.

774
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,780
And it's going to change the way they have to block.

775
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,400
So, yeah.

776
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,480
You got to do it a little later.

777
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,360
Do the attack a tiny bit later.

778
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:30,620
Okay.

779
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,900
And then do it the other side.

780
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,020
I guarantee you.

781
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:41,440
If you just kind of throw this out, because it's a cross up, meaning they have to block a different direction, it's going to overwhelm people really, really hard.

782
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,340
And you can keep spamming that over and over.

783
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,640
And then when you want to mix it up, you can stay on the ground for a second and then press triangle.

784
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:50,900
Okay.

785
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,220
I guarantee you there's going to be players who are just going to lose to that over and over.

786
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,380
Okay.

787
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,580
Because it's really hard for them to hit you out of the air.

788
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,000
So, they might have a move that can stop you.

789
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,060
If they stop you, sure, slow down.

790
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,140
Okay.

791
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,940
Yeah, that I think might be super good cheese.

792
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,600
And then eventually they'll be scared and they'll just sit there.

793
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,060
And then you can press your triangle.

794
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:26,600
Because the whole gameplay with Gief is you want to just scare them from moving so that you can press triangle and grab them and do a ton of damage.

795
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:26,840
Yeah.

796
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,980
That's his whole mentality.

797
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,620
So, we're trying to figure out the best way to make that happen.

798
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:31,640
Okay.

799
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,440
BrawlPro says we did this last night.

800
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,140
You forgot?

801
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,500
I don't remember like 60% of the stuff he told me.

802
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,800
It's a lot.

803
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,320
I mean, it's like drinking from a fire hose.

804
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,240
He's trying to teach me some combos.

805
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,720
I don't even remember the combo.

806
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,600
I think it was like...

807
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,380
What was it?

808
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,100
What was the combo he was trying to teach me?

809
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,460
I don't know.

810
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:52,900
Who cares?

811
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,160
That's what I was worried.

812
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,880
When I saw he was teaching, I'm like, he's going to be trying to teach you some hard shit.

813
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,680
Like, you got to understand the vibe here.

814
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,420
It's got to be...

815
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,900
We're keeping it simple.

816
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,200
Oh, I remember.

817
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:02,920
It was like...

818
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,180
Oh, I remember.

819
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,100
Okay.

820
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,780
It was like splash and then this and then this.

821
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:08,360
Yeah.

822
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,040
Too much.

823
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,720
Too much.

824
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,160
Too much.

825
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:10,880
My brain fried.

826
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,380
Yeah.

827
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,980
You already know the combo you want to do.

828
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:18,500
So the only combos you should worry about are holding the auto combo button and mashing circle or X.

829
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,160
And you can do that when you're closer to the opponent.

830
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:21,940
Yeah.

831
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:28,660
So you can do it there and just hold it and mash and yeah.

832
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,340
I wouldn't worry about doing any classic combos.

833
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,360
The one with X, I think it's pretty good because it hits from further away.

834
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,240
So you don't have to do it from the...

835
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,640
You don't have to do it from a jump in.

836
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:45,540
So you can kind of be out of your command grab range, like your triangle range.

837
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,140
And then just hold auto combo and mash X.

838
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:50,460
Yeah.

839
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:56,060
If it hits, this big super will come out if you have the meter.

840
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,400
Yeah.

841
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,340
And if it doesn't hit, you'll just get the lariat.

842
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,320
And that's technical.

843
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,940
It's technically unsafe, but I don't think your opponents are going to punish you.

844
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,880
And the other button at that range is just X without auto combo.

845
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,200
He does the chop and that, yeah, you can mash that.

846
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,580
So that has really good range actually.

847
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:23,560
So that's another option, like after your three square range, like, you know, you mash square three times and it pushes you away.

848
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,540
That's another great option from at that spacing.

849
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:27,780
Yeah.

850
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:28,500
Yeah.

851
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,580
So that's one of his best pokes.

852
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:38,420
So your main strategy, you know, you can do the crouching square standing X.

853
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:44,160
Those are going to be your main like buttons that you're going to poke with and then stand X as well.

854
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,300
Oh, stand X.

855
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:46,580
Okay.

856
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:46,840
Yeah.

857
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,540
Those are going to be your main pokes at that range.

858
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,260
And then other than that, mix in what you know, like the, the running bear grab, throw that in randomly.

859
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,920
Once you kind of scare them or that's the back triangle.

860
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:57,440
Yay.

861
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,500
And then mix in the jump splash when you're closer and then mixing the grab.

862
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:07,400
And I think really that's, let's keep it simple, right?

863
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,960
Let's let's keep a few options and rotate between them.

864
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,900
Oh, thank God.

865
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,260
Okay.

866
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,120
I like simple.

867
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,180
I only know five moves in Tekken and that's all I need.

868
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:19,520
Yeah.

869
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:19,940
Yeah.

870
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,620
Let's let's not overwhelm anything.

871
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,580
I mean, if there's something else you want to worry about, the only other thing along with this is the DI.

872
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,900
Just throw that out every once in a while.

873
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:31,460
Yeah.

874
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:36,260
And let's here, let's, let's test the combo that I just want to see you do the combo.

875
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,820
Can you pause the training mode and I want to put on a setting real quick.

876
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:47,300
So let's go to dummy settings, like the big menus.

877
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:47,560
Yeah.

878
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:47,960
Yeah.

879
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:52,760
And then on a counter, we're going to put it on punish counter.

880
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,900
So just keep clicking that always punish counter.

881
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:55,280
Okay.

882
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,500
And then on block, what's changed that setting to block after first hit.

883
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,540
So just keep scrolling.

884
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,400
There.

885
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:04,760
Perfect.

886
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,240
So now we can back out of the menu.

887
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,060
Okay.

888
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,020
And then now let's try a DI.

889
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,840
So it should do the big slowdown now.

890
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,940
See and now you match the triangle.

891
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,540
Perfect.

892
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,220
You got the combo.

893
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:18,780
There you go.

894
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,500
Look how much damage you did.

895
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,180
Perfect.

896
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:22,940
Yeah.

897
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,920
This carried me all the way to bronze four.

898
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,260
Let's go.

899
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:25,980
Perfect.

900
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:26,920
Yeah.

901
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,920
Then you know it.

902
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,700
If you can do this combo, you got your best combo right here.

903
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,920
I think you're set.

904
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,340
Yay.

905
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,200
Yay.

906
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:40,840
Hell yeah.

907
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,360
Is there anything else you're curious about or thinking about right now?

908
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,200
Um, how do I, how do I play against Blanka?

909
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:50,880
Okay.

910
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,460
That one's going to be hard.

911
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,260
Cause Blanka has full screen lunging.

912
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,060
Yeah.

913
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,480
I wish I had training mode with you right now.

914
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,500
That's that's going to be the hardest thing.

915
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:06,420
So, um, against Blanka pairing is good.

916
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:12,020
I don't want to overwhelm you with that, but like, you know, your drive rush and the Perry.

917
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,140
Yeah.

918
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,980
They kind of, they work together.

919
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:15,320
Right.

920
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,320
Cause you have to be in Perry to then cancel to the dry brush.

921
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:25,240
When Blanka is going to fly at you, you want to hold the Perry, not tap it, like press it.

922
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,380
If I hold it, you'll absorb him when he flies at you.

923
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:32,840
And then after that, you're going to dash to do your drive rush to run at him.

924
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:33,820
Okay.

925
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:34,640
So, and then.

926
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:35,360
Right.

927
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,740
Cause the whole thing is, um, the Blanka player is going to keep spamming.

928
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,960
They're called Blanka balls.

929
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:45,740
They're going to spam that, which is a full screen lunging move to try to hit you from full screen.

930
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,180
And then you need to approach.

931
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,820
So that's going to be a big part of the game plan is absorbing that and then running at them.

932
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:53,820
Okay.

933
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,280
Okay.

934
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,020
So, uh, chat says Lariat beats Blanka ball.

935
01:02:59,280 --> 01:02:59,600
Hmm.

936
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:00,740
I don't know.

937
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:01,860
We'll have, we'd have to test that.

938
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,720
I try that, but sometimes it does like, sometimes they hit me before I hit them.

939
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,120
Yeah.

940
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,680
Cause Lariat's very slow is the problem.

941
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah.

942
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,660
It's like very 50 50.

943
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,280
Yeah.

944
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:23,200
It's worth trying, but if it's not working out, the safest thing to do is like to Perry and then you can try dry brushing in or just Perry and then walk in and then kind of work your way in.

945
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,100
Um.

946
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:24,440
Okay.

947
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,140
Yeah.

948
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,240
Maybe we can, uh, practice that tomorrow or something.

949
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,060
We have time.

950
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,340
Cause that's going to be the trickiest kind of cheese to get around.

951
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,440
We got to get familiar with that.

952
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:37,580
Yeah.

953
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,940
Perry's going to be your, your best option against the blockable from distance.

954
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,140
Cause the problem is if you block in this game for too long, you lose your meter.

955
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,780
So you can't really block it forever either.

956
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,460
Even, even if you're being very patient.

957
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:50,500
Okay.

958
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,140
Uh, stand heavy punch.

959
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:52,360
Yeah.

960
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,140
That might be an option.

961
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:53,540
Yeah.

962
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:09,120
And sometimes I do this a lot too.

963
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,180
That's good.

964
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,580
Yeah, it covers a lot of distance.

965
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,060
Like if you do it from far away.

966
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:20,860
Like this usually is my like... like if I'm desperate and I want them to... and it's like they're like almost one HP.

967
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:29,480
One thing that's really good is if you land your grab, like if you start from like the middle of the screen, like restart training mode and land your grab.

968
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:36,360
After you land your grab, you can walk forward like just a little tiny bit and then do that move and it'll hit them.

969
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,580
So it's a way to like keep your pressure going.

970
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:43,460
So if you test it here, like do the triangle move on him.

971
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,160
Okay.

972
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:47,500
And then...

973
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,840
And then just walk forward a tiny bit.

974
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,760
A tiny bit and do that move.

975
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,240
Even less than that.

976
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,280
You can do it even less.

977
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,200
Like a tighter walk.

978
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,780
It'll keep them like pinned down basically.

979
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,000
It'll keep the pressure going.

980
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,680
Pretty good.

981
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,700
You can do it even less.

982
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,640
Like I'm talking like a tiny, tiny walk.

983
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,540
But that was the idea.

984
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,160
You got it.

985
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,360
Like that's a good way to... because the problem with this move is that it does a bunch of damage.

986
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:14,720
But see how far away it leaves you.

987
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,900
You know, keep his best up close.

988
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,260
So definitely you can mix in that move after the grab.

989
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,580
Like a little walk forward and do it and get in.

990
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,420
And once again, that scares them to block.

991
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:30,460
And when they're scared to block, that's when you can use your drive rush to get in.

992
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:32,940
Okay.

993
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,260
Oh, not that.

994
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:38,660
Uh...

995
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,220
BrawlPro says you were doing drive rush after SPDs last night.

996
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,000
Yeah, that's good.

997
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:48,880
Yeah, definitely do a lot of drive rush after SPD.

998
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:49,860
Yeah.

999
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:55,560
Do you ever do drive rush into the down circle?

1000
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,820
Like that's his sweep where he kicks the ground.

1001
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,800
Oh, he said this move sucks.

1002
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:01,560
Yeah, sorry.

1003
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:01,980
Not that one.

1004
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:02,140
This one?

1005
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:03,160
Down forward circle.

1006
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,400
Oh, this one.

1007
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:04,580
Yeah.

1008
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,500
Yeah, definitely don't do down circle.

1009
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,120
That move does suck.

1010
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:06,400
Yeah.

1011
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:08,820
He said this move fucking sucks.

1012
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,080
Yeah, it actually does suck.

1013
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah, I do this sometimes.

1014
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,660
Yeah, because you can also...

1015
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:17,620
When I'm on the left side, when I'm on the other side, I forget how to do it.

1016
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,120
Oh, yeah.

1017
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,260
Yeah, that happens.

1018
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,520
Yeah, there's a lot of side swapping in Street Fighter.

1019
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,580
It takes a while to remember each side.

1020
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,840
Yeah, if you can land the triangle, you can drive rush and then do that move when you're close enough.

1021
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,040
That'll body a lot of people.

1022
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,160
Or just throw that out.

1023
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,460
Like that down forward circle.

1024
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,060
It has such good range.

1025
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,640
A lot of players will walk into it and get hit.

1026
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,430
Doki's a left side player and this is good.

1027
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:50,130
Yeah.

1028
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:50,650
Okay.

1029
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,210
But I just...

1030
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:53,590
I'll try this in rank.

1031
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,610
Yeah, you'll beat some people.

1032
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:57,050
And once they stop it...

1033
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:57,510
Oh, I don't know.

1034
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,310
D-Gen hours was fucking crazy.

1035
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:03,190
Like, Bra Pro was watching me fight some crazy bronze players.

1036
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,970
I mean, you're in no man's land right now.

1037
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,590
That's why I'm trying to make you as degenerate as they are.

1038
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:17,830
Like, it's such a long journey to get out of there and play anything resembling, like, classy Street Fighter.

1039
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:20,870
That I think just fighting dirty is the best strategy right now.

1040
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:24,250
Oh, wait.

1041
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:24,650
What the fuck?

1042
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:25,290
I can't do this.

1043
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:26,690
Oh.

1044
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:28,850
Pressing the wrong button.

1045
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:29,490
Yeah.

1046
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:31,730
Okay.

1047
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:33,010
Yay.

1048
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:35,090
Yeah.

1049
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:35,810
Strats.

1050
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,640
And then when they're scared, just triangle.

1051
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,020
Woo!

1052
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:47,600
Okay.

1053
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,360
Perfect.

1054
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:58,800
Okay.

1055
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,300
Anything else you're thinking of?

1056
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,200
Anything else you can remember from your games that was giving you trouble?

1057
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:04,780
Bra Pro.

1058
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,460
Do you remember?

1059
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,220
I don't remember.

1060
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,200
It was, like, four in the morning.

1061
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:09,540
All right.

1062
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,400
Do we got notes?

1063
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,120
Bra Pro?

1064
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,760
Bra Pro.

1065
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,980
You know more.

1066
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,340
Sounds like he was giving you, like, really hard homework.

1067
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:17,900
I don't know.

1068
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,680
Too much.

1069
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,860
She dies a lot after she gets knocked down and they keep hitting her.

1070
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:24,600
Okay.

1071
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,740
Because they put me in the corner and I get scared.

1072
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:27,640
Yeah.

1073
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,100
Okay.

1074
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,460
So that might be where you're on wake up.

1075
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,420
Is she getting counter hit a lot?

1076
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,160
That's what I was asking.

1077
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:34,860
Like, do you find yourself mashing?

1078
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,180
Oh, I don't block.

1079
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,200
Okay.

1080
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,840
So you're pressing buttons.

1081
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,040
I don't block.

1082
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,420
You keep telling me to do this.

1083
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,120
Yeah.

1084
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:43,540
Do that.

1085
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,640
If you're going to mash, here's the thing.

1086
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:51,360
If you're going to mash, the only discipline I want you to have is mash your square while holding that position.

1087
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,520
If you're going to mash, at least make it this.

1088
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,000
Right?

1089
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:55,640
Okay.

1090
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,680
Until you build some space.

1091
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,080
Like, that's the one thing I will do.

1092
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,240
That's what I will say because you're going to mash.

1093
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,500
You're going to get scared and you're going to start mashing.

1094
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:06,660
If you can at least try to make it that move, then that's good.

1095
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:06,900
Okay.

1096
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,120
Oh, actually, the one final thing to mash.

1097
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:11,440
Do you know how to do your level three?

1098
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:12,860
Oh, yeah.

1099
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,080
Mash that.

1100
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:22,740
If you got knocked down and they're approaching you, I mean, you lost your meter, but if you have that meter, 100% mash that.

1101
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,460
Those are the two things I'm telling you to mash.

1102
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:27,020
Okay.

1103
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:32,400
Now, if you can try to keep it to those two, it's going to be hard, but those are the two things that you should try to mash.

1104
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,460
Okay.

1105
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,280
Yeah.

1106
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,960
And once you build the space, then, you know, try to stop mashing.

1107
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:49,280
The idea is, like, if they leave a gap in their pressure, because they will because their pressure is bad, you will tag them with the little pokes and build some space and have some breathing room.

1108
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,720
Have her play computer.

1109
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,820
Oh, we can try that.

1110
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:54,480
Yeah.

1111
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,000
Why don't we try just having you play the computer for a little bit?

1112
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,780
Put the CPU on, like, level three or something.

1113
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,880
So, no, I think you can do it here, actually.

1114
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:06,600
Can you do it in training?

1115
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:07,600
Oh.

1116
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,120
I think you can do it versus also.

1117
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:10,480
Versus?

1118
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,320
You can do both.

1119
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:11,660
Yeah.

1120
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,300
We can go to versus.

1121
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,420
Make CPU Blanca.

1122
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:16,780
We can try that.

1123
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,380
What the fuck?

1124
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:19,440
Yeah.

1125
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:20,180
Okay.

1126
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:20,760
You're good.

1127
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:22,820
So, next.

1128
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,220
And then, yeah, that's good.

1129
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,600
And then, yeah, we can try Blanca.

1130
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,660
And then CPU level, let's put on that, like, three.

1131
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,220
Yeah, let's try three.

1132
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:42,780
Okay.

1133
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:43,880
Let's see.

1134
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,440
I don't know.

1135
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,900
I don't know what he's going to do.

1136
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,360
You think CPU has eyes?

1137
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:51,980
Maybe.

1138
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:53,260
I don't know.

1139
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,400
Sometimes they read your soul.

1140
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,080
That's the problem.

1141
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,480
I don't want you to turn up the level too high.

1142
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,860
Do you think they read my soul?

1143
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:58,500
Yeah.

1144
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:58,760
Sometimes they read your soul.

1145
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,140
Sometimes.

1146
01:10:59,180 --> 01:10:59,620
Okay.

1147
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,420
Then I'll just do this.

1148
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:05,580
Okay.

1149
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,720
I don't think the CPU has eyes.

1150
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,460
I don't...

1151
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,280
We are going to win this shit.

1152
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,760
We're so ready.

1153
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,180
We're so ready.

1154
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,140
Let's go.

1155
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,860
Set it higher.

1156
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,920
Yeah, we might need to level up the CPU.

1157
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:26,740
I don't...

1158
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,080
Yeah, I don't think the CPU...

1159
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,580
The CPU is learning.

1160
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,740
This is beautiful.

1161
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,040
You might just win like this.

1162
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:40,520
Okay.

1163
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:40,940
Okay.

1164
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,460
Let's crank up the CPU a little bit.

1165
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:44,580
Okay.

1166
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:47,620
Select character, I think.

1167
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,200
Okay.

1168
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:50,740
Hell yeah.

1169
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,160
Okay.

1170
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,360
That was sick, though.

1171
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:55,980
Let's try five.

1172
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:56,680
Let's try five.

1173
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,040
Let's see.

1174
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,580
If you go like...

1175
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:58,740
I don't know.

1176
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,000
Seven, eight.

1177
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,260
It's actually crazy.

1178
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,760
CPU is unfair at that level.

1179
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:12,130
Nice.

1180
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,480
Oh, he backed out.

1181
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:20,920
Okay.

1182
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:21,960
Okay.

1183
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,100
It begins.

1184
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:24,980
Oh, my God.

1185
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,100
He's doing stuff now.

1186
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,360
What is that?

1187
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:28,780
What is that?

1188
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,220
It's like an assist thing.

1189
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,100
Okay.

1190
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,580
He's doing a bunch of his commands.

1191
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:33,800
Man grab.

1192
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,360
That jump move is his version of the running bear grab that you're doing.

1193
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:37,700
Yeah.

1194
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,140
You have to jump it just like you would have to jump your own grab.

1195
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,740
What if I don't?

1196
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,360
What if I just grab him back?

1197
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:46,920
That works, too.

1198
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:50,260
If you grab him before he grabs you, then no complaints from me.

1199
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:53,880
Oh.

1200
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:55,820
There you go.

1201
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:56,400
Oh.

1202
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,160
There you go.

1203
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:57,840
Oh.

1204
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,380
There you go.

1205
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,020
Oh, I did it, too.

1206
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:00,880
Yeah.

1207
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,300
I'm sorry, man.

1208
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:01,720
That's the idea.

1209
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,020
Even the CPU can't handle it.

1210
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:03,560
Oh, no.

1211
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,480
You're good.

1212
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:04,700
You're good.

1213
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,000
Just block.

1214
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:05,380
Okay.

1215
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:05,580
Oh, no.

1216
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:05,940
Never mind.

1217
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,480
I just grabbed him.

1218
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:07,900
Okay.

1219
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,100
Oh.

1220
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:10,620
That's not bad.

1221
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:10,880
Okay.

1222
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,920
In this mode, he's going to do a bunch of those flying Blanka balls.

1223
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,320
Okay.

1224
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,380
Nice.

1225
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,540
Very good.

1226
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,360
And the next time you land that, you can mash your level three instead.

1227
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,620
Because you'll just kill him if you land that again.

1228
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,200
Okay.

1229
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:28,360
Yeah.

1230
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,100
That's the grab.

1231
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,200
No.

1232
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:33,560
No.

1233
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,320
Okay.

1234
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,480
That worked.

1235
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,980
We got to go up another level.

1236
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:42,220
Okay.

1237
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:46,260
The CPU does not comprehend the techniques you're throwing at him.

1238
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,200
Okay.

1239
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:53,840
Let's see.

1240
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,920
Let's see if it understands what an SPD is at this level.

1241
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:00,870
Yeah.

1242
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,170
This is looking good.

1243
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:06,970
Oh.

1244
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:09,310
Hello.

1245
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:09,890
Goodbye.

1246
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:10,210
Nice.

1247
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:11,890
No.

1248
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:12,050
No.

1249
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:12,770
He jumps.

1250
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:14,370
How could you?

1251
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:16,170
Yeah.

1252
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,190
He's grabbing you back now.

1253
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:19,810
Oh.

1254
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:21,650
And he's not letting me grab, too.

1255
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:22,510
Whoa.

1256
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:23,870
Yeah.

1257
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,070
This is when the CPU starts cheating.

1258
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,130
That's not fair.

1259
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:29,830
Nice.

1260
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:30,510
Okay.

1261
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:33,370
Oh, damn.

1262
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:37,710
Oh.

1263
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:38,470
That's fine.

1264
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,230
You can tank that.

1265
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:40,050
You got the health for it.

1266
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:41,070
Oh.

1267
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:41,510
Okay.

1268
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:42,830
Nice.

1269
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:43,430
Oh.

1270
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,450
Oh.

1271
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:43,590
That was nice.

1272
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:45,730
I like the squares thrown in there.

1273
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:50,010
Very good.

1274
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,410
That was a great time to use that.

1275
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,950
Hell yeah.

1276
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,140
Hell yeah.

1277
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:01,940
Whoa.

1278
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:02,680
Oh.

1279
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,480
Oh, my God.

1280
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:06,300
He jumps a lot.

1281
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,320
Oh.

1282
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,420
I just timed it.

1283
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:15,360
Nice.

1284
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,100
No.

1285
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:19,280
Oh.

1286
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:22,800
Oh.

1287
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:24,720
Oh, my God.

1288
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:38,370
Nice.

1289
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:39,270
Okay.

1290
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:40,650
I like that you used the auto combo there.

1291
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,570
That was good.

1292
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:42,890
That was good.

1293
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,350
Yeah.

1294
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:48,210
The only thing I would say is let's try to use the Lariat a little bit less.

1295
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:49,830
Like, you were using the Lariat when he was in the corner.

1296
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:50,070
Okay.

1297
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:53,530
But you saw it wasn't working and then you swapped to the heavy auto combo.

1298
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:53,930
Yeah.

1299
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:54,790
That was brilliant.

1300
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,470
That was a perfect time to use that heavy auto combo.

1301
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:57,870
Yeah.

1302
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:59,290
That was perfect.

1303
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:00,470
Okay.

1304
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:00,510
Yeah.

1305
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:02,690
The CPUs are kind of a little dumb about Zangief, though.

1306
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:05,110
Like, it doesn't really understand the command grabs.

1307
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:06,830
Oh, 7 might be.

1308
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:07,310
Let's see.

1309
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,650
It's about to get serious.

1310
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:10,730
Oh.

1311
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:11,630
Oh, shit.

1312
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:11,990
Okay.

1313
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:12,570
Maybe 8.

1314
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:13,190
No.

1315
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:13,610
Let's see.

1316
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:13,930
Let's see.

1317
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:14,750
I want to see what happens.

1318
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,490
I thought that was the pattern we were trying to do.

1319
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:16,810
No, no.

1320
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:17,210
Let's go.

1321
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:17,690
Let's go.

1322
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:19,670
Let's see what happens.

1323
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:20,210
Okay.

1324
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:20,750
Let's see.

1325
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,610
I think they actually have combos at level 7.

1326
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:22,830
All right.

1327
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:23,090
Whoa.

1328
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:28,350
He's going to be crazy.

1329
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:28,650
He may be.

1330
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:32,530
If you beat level 7, level 8 CPU, that's going to be insane.

1331
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:36,250
Yeah.

1332
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,730
Nice heavies.

1333
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:41,180
Oh, no.

1334
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:44,640
Time for the square.

1335
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,840
Time for mashing square.

1336
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:46,460
Yeah.

1337
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:46,860
Perfect.

1338
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,120
See?

1339
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:48,960
See how that backed him away?

1340
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,060
That was good.

1341
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:51,140
Leave me alone!

1342
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:53,620
Nice.

1343
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,880
Leave me alone.

1344
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,500
Nice combo.

1345
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,120
Hell yeah.

1346
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:58,740
Oh, shit.

1347
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,860
That's not what I wanted, actually.

1348
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,060
Oh, that's not what I wanted.

1349
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:01,800
Okay.

1350
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,600
Good read.

1351
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,220
Countering the DI with Lariat.

1352
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,600
That was so sick!

1353
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:17,780
Oh my god!

1354
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,780
It's crazy that you have the SPD anti-airs.

1355
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,640
Okay.

1356
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,940
No, but you saw the situation and you capitalized on it.

1357
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,900
The awareness is crazy right now.

1358
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,660
Oh, that was a good idea.

1359
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,700
Yeah, that was a good idea.

1360
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,280
I was just a little late.

1361
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,680
No, please!

1362
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,560
Not the Q&A!

1363
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,020
Time for Square!

1364
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:42,940
Yes!

1365
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:43,500
Perfect!

1366
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,040
Not the Q&A!

1367
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,580
Time for Square!

1368
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:50,880
No!

1369
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:51,360
No!

1370
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,680
He's gonna do the thing!

1371
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,460
Yeah, that was a tough situation.

1372
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,320
Nice.

1373
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,640
They got combos now.

1374
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:10,740
Oh, guys.

1375
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,040
He actually knows combos.

1376
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:17,780
Yeah, they start leveling up quick.

1377
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,620
Oh, he has his little assistant chasing you.

1378
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:20,940
Okay.

1379
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:24,480
Alright, time for Square.

1380
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,300
Not the Q&A!

1381
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:26,040
Not the Q&A!

1382
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:28,500
Oh!

1383
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:28,980
Let's go!

1384
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:29,960
That's the other one!

1385
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,440
Even better!

1386
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:31,860
Let's go!

1387
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:32,800
Okay.

1388
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,240
You're gonna need, like, one more grab.

1389
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:40,730
No!

1390
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:41,610
Oh, Goodberry!

1391
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:42,690
Oh!

1392
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:43,570
Triangle!

1393
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:44,370
Yes!

1394
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,710
Oh, my God!

1395
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:48,570
Yay!

1396
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:50,310
I'm alive!

1397
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:56,910
I can't... I honestly am so impressed that you just beat the CPU at level 7.

1398
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:57,890
You're at level 8.

1399
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:58,330
Let's see it.

1400
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:58,610
Let's see.

1401
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:59,190
I gotta see it.

1402
01:18:59,250 --> 01:18:59,950
This is insane.

1403
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,930
No, I'm gonna get ranked!

1404
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:03,190
This is insane.

1405
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,330
You know what you're doing!

1406
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:09,870
I'm gonna get destroyed!

1407
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,170
No, you know what you're doing!

1408
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:17,350
Let's see it.

1409
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:17,590
Fuck!

1410
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:18,230
Okay.

1411
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:20,330
Okay.

1412
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:23,870
Oh, my God.

1413
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,450
He's actually blocking, too.

1414
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:27,490
Oh, does he get it?

1415
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:28,090
No, he gets it.

1416
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:29,450
Yeah, he counters the ice now.

1417
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:30,590
Yeah.

1418
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:33,950
Please.

1419
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:37,370
Please, let me be alive.

1420
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:38,350
Oh, he's throwing out BlankaChan.

1421
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,470
Wait, does... CPU BlankaChan has mixups?

1422
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,150
Good squares.

1423
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:43,750
Good squares, though.

1424
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:46,670
Don't leave me alone in the square!

1425
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:47,770
See?

1426
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:48,450
Good squares.

1427
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:50,810
The squares are good, though.

1428
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:56,250
Oh.

1429
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,810
I thought I could get the anti.

1430
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:01,890
Oh.

1431
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:02,410
What the fuck?!

1432
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:07,150
Oh, he did Perfect Variance and countered DI to level 2 activation.

1433
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:08,470
What the fuck do I do?!

1434
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,570
He's gotta style it on you.

1435
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:10,610
What do I do?!

1436
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:10,930
Good square.

1437
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:11,290
Good square.

1438
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:12,230
What do I do?!

1439
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,410
Get out of here.

1440
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:15,610
Good square.

1441
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:15,990
See?

1442
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:16,570
You're building space.

1443
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,450
Nice.

1444
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:18,330
Now you can get out.

1445
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:20,630
Fucking hell.

1446
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:22,310
Nice.

1447
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,250
No, that's not what I wanted.

1448
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,510
Whoops.

1449
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:29,930
Okay.

1450
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:30,390
You're in.

1451
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:31,090
No!

1452
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:32,810
Good idea, though.

1453
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:35,390
Get me out of here!

1454
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:38,210
That was a good idea.

1455
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:38,890
Okay.

1456
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:41,110
Level 8 CPU is kind of a different beast.

1457
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:42,330
Oh.

1458
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:42,730
Okay.

1459
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:43,850
Let's go.

1460
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:44,430
Run it back.

1461
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:45,770
Okay.

1462
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:46,170
Let's go.

1463
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:47,850
Oh.

1464
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:48,610
Maybe he...

1465
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,630
Oh, he jumps, too!

1466
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:53,370
Yeah.

1467
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:54,230
CA would have killed.

1468
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:54,610
Yeah.

1469
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:56,190
Mashing CA there would have been good.

1470
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:57,030
Oh, man.

1471
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:01,450
Oh, my God.

1472
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:02,250
Leave me alone, please.

1473
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:06,730
He might force you to block a little bit on wake up.

1474
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:09,650
I know we didn't talk about that plan, but...

1475
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:11,910
Please.

1476
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:12,690
You might have to.

1477
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:15,710
I'm scared.

1478
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:24,350
I think what you gotta do is when he's approaching you, you gotta press your circle, the heavy punch, and, like, hold it a little to get the armor.

1479
01:21:24,370 --> 01:21:24,690
Yeah.

1480
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:24,810
Okay.

1481
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:27,170
You need that armor to, like, stop him from...

1482
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:27,310
Yeah.

1483
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:27,670
Perfect.

1484
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:28,550
Oh, my God.

1485
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:28,970
Never mind.

1486
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:29,730
He is godlike.

1487
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:31,230
I'm sorry.

1488
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:32,490
What is he doing?

1489
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:33,370
I'm sorry.

1490
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:37,990
Oh, my God.

1491
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,370
He's ready.

1492
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,250
Bro, this guy...

1493
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:44,870
What is his rank?

1494
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:46,410
What is his rank?

1495
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:48,250
This is beyond master.

1496
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:50,210
This is, like, at least 1800 MR.

1497
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:52,850
Minimum.

1498
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,030
Yeah.

1499
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:55,090
This guy's kinda nice.

1500
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:55,630
He wins.

1501
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:56,470
Yeah.

1502
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:57,030
Yeah.

1503
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:00,730
Level 8 is, like, when they start cheating, kinda.

1504
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:02,510
I know my place.

1505
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:03,170
Yeah.

1506
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,010
Level 7 is a good one to practice.

1507
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:08,010
Level 8, they really start kinda cheating.

1508
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:10,830
Like, it's just unfair.

1509
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:12,850
The reactions are inhuman.

1510
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:15,850
But that's... your game plan is good.

1511
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:21,490
The only thing I would say is try using that circle, the heavy punch, a little bit more at a distance.

1512
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:21,690
Yeah.

1513
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:21,750
Yeah.

1514
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,270
Because that move with armor is super buff.

1515
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:26,070
Like, people will just mash into it.

1516
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,970
But I like everything else you're doing.

1517
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:30,130
I have no complaints.

1518
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:30,610
Nice.

1519
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:32,570
I think you're killing it.

1520
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:35,130
Nice.

1521
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:36,430
That's all I need to know.

1522
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:40,170
As long as I beat one person during the slam, I'm happy.

1523
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,230
Yeah.

1524
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:48,610
And I think if we have another chance to sync up when this is online, we can try going over the Blanka-specific stuff.

1525
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:51,850
Because I'm sure they're gonna tell Gumi, right?

1526
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:52,570
Yeah.

1527
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,770
She's gonna sit there and do Blanka Ball over and over.

1528
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:55,210
Yeah.

1529
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,950
But we just need to have, like, one counter to that.

1530
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:00,110
I'll figure out what the perfect counter is, and then we can cover that.

1531
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,590
And I think you can style on her.

1532
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,650
Go ahead.

1533
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:03,210
It'll be sick.

1534
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:05,530
Nice.

1535
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,810
That's all I need to know.

1536
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:07,690
Sweet.

1537
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:08,410
Okay.

1538
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:09,970
Anything else for now, then?

1539
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:11,290
Any other last questions or anything?

1540
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:13,950
No, I think that's... I think I'm good.

1541
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:15,090
That's all I need.

1542
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:16,130
I think.

1543
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:16,470
I hope.

1544
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:16,790
Awesome.

1545
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:21,310
And then, I guess, like, tomorrow when Rink is back online, we can have, like...

1546
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:23,310
I guess, like...

1547
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:26,170
a better coaching session with, like, actual players.

1548
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:26,890
Yeah.

1549
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:30,630
Are you gonna be available in non-D-Gen hours tomorrow?

1550
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,110
What's going on?

1551
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:32,390
Yeah, yeah.

1552
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:32,930
Okay.

1553
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:33,770
I'll be available.

1554
01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:35,770
Yeah, I'll be available during the day tomorrow.

1555
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:39,530
I'm gonna try to get on and see if you want some coaching and practice.

1556
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:40,470
So that's my plan tomorrow.

1557
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:41,390
Okay.

1558
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:42,450
Sweet.

1559
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:43,370
All right.

1560
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:43,810
Hell yeah.

1561
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:44,930
Well, nice meeting you, Doki.

1562
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:47,630
I don't know if you're coaching anybody else, but, like, good luck with the rest of your day.

1563
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:49,110
Same to you.

1564
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:50,090
Thank you very much.

1565
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:50,910
Yeah.

1566
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:52,170
Great meeting you.

1567
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:53,190
Nice meeting you as well.

1568
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,430
Finally the first coaching session.

1569
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:55,030
Yes.

1570
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:56,450
It went very well.

1571
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:57,170
I'm very impressed.

1572
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:57,650
Yay!

1573
01:23:58,590 --> 01:23:59,170
All right.

1574
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,070
Take care.

1575
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:00,650
Till next time.

1576
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:01,030
All right.

1577
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:01,530
Bye.

1578
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:06,660
Okay.

1579
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:09,080
There we go.

1580
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:10,760
Good session.

1581
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,100
She knows what she's doing.

1582
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,160
Listen, BrawlPro, you in this chat right now?

1583
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:19,300
Stop whatever poison you're putting into Doki's mind.

1584
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:19,920
She's ready.

1585
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:23,680
She's ready.

1586
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:24,220
She's ready.

1587
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:24,320
She's ready.

1588
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:24,760
She's ready.

1589
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,840
Try to teach her combos and shit?

1590
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,800
Come on, bro.

1591
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,920
You got to do the headbutt into the Hellstab into the Lariat?

1592
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:35,780
No, dude.

1593
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,280
You got to remember who she's fighting.

1594
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:45,980
All we got to figure out is Blanka Ball.

1595
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,300
That's about it.

1596
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,160
Like, what's the easiest and most consistent way to deal with Blanka Ball?
