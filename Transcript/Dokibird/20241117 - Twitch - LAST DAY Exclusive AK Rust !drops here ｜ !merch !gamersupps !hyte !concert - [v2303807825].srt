1
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,440
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,080
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,080
I'm finally back.

4
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,440
I have no idea what has happened while I was gone.

5
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,640
But we're gonna see today.

6
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,980
It's been another 50 years since I was in a coma again.

7
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,320
I was in another coma, so we're back at it again to see what else happened.

8
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,380
What has changed in the lands of Rust?

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,460
It's been another 84 years.

10
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,060
Yes, it's been another 84 years.

11
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,460
I couldn't stream another time because...

12
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,140
Oh my god!

13
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,620
Serves

14
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,110
me good!

15
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,890
Thank you!

16
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,450
For those who don't know, I had to do a work travel.

17
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,750
I had to do a business trip earlier to practice for my concert that's next month.

18
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,330
So it was very poor timing because obviously I couldn't do...

19
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,290
I wasn't able to stream Rust.

20
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,670
I was very tired.

21
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,370
And I didn't have the internet to stream Rust when I was there.

22
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,730
So, I heard there's two more days.

23
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,590
There's two more days left of the Rust drops.

24
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,050
So, if you guys don't know, I have an exclusive AK skin in Rust with Sykkuno.

25
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,530
Shoutout to Sykkuno for like...

26
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,570
Shoutout to Sykkuno for like holding the...

27
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,950
Helping the Dragoons get the Rust gun.

28
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,590
Because I couldn't stream a lot of Rust the last four days.

29
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,950
So, shoutout to them.

30
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,690
But yes, I don't know what's...

31
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,110
I don't know what's going on now in the server.

32
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,070
So, everything is gonna be very new.

33
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,340
We're gonna see how...

34
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,200
Maybe I can actually get my gun.

35
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,680
Maybe I can actually see what my gun looks like.

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,760
That's all I want.

37
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,120
I just wanna know what my gun looks like.

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,420
I don't know how long I'll be streaming today.

39
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,460
I'll try to get at least two hours in.

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,180
So, like those who, you know...

41
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,540
Those who stopped by can at least get the gun within those two hours.

42
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,240
Am I the only naked person on the server now?

43
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
No way.

44
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,700
There's no way.

45
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,440
There's no way.

46
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,100
Are you tired?

47
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,680
I was cleaning my apartment.

48
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,860
I actually unpacked a bit.

49
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,840
What does that even mean?

50
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,040
I can take the clothes.

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,560
There's clothes in the...

52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,940
Is the castle still...

53
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,780
Is my fort still even there?

54
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,900
That's the thing.

55
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,940
Do I still have a house?

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
Do I even still have a house?

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,340
I don't know.

58
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,760
We're gonna find out soon.

59
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,660
We're gonna find out if we have...

60
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,680
Is it abandoned?

61
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,880
Is it...

62
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,860
Do I... Am I alive?

63
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,200
Am I alive?

64
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,720
Am I homeless?

65
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,160
Do I still have a home?

66
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,420
Does my tribe still exist?

67
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,580
Does the Lurklings even exist anymore?

68
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,520
So, we'll see.

69
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,860
We'll see what we're gonna find out today.

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,980
God, I hope Ted's dead.

71
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,680
I...

72
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,640
I... That's the only thing I hope for.

73
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,880
If anything, I hope he's fucking dead.

74
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,260
Fuck Ted.

75
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,090
Oh, there we go.

76
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,850
Progress Valhalla.

77
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,130
There we go.

78
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,470
Alright.

79
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,650
Progressive Valhalla.

80
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,810
Okay, let's see how...

81
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,590
Oh, yeah!

82
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,390
Yo!

83
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:02,790
Ayyy!

84
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,430
Oh, bro.

85
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,530
Wait, what happened?

86
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,970
Dude, what is it with you and your comas?

87
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,770
Sorry, how many years has it been?

88
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,630
I don't have time for this.

89
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,270
Get out of here.

90
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,750
Wait, no!

91
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,490
How many years has it been, Duncan?!

92
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,490
Get out.

93
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,050
No, get out.

94
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,530
How many years?!

95
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,270
I need to know!

96
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,670
Okay, wait.

97
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,450
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

98
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,950
I'm waiting for someone to spawn.

99
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,010
There's an insider in here.

100
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:22,890
Wait, there's an insider?!

101
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:23,690
I'm watching the bags.

102
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,870
Okay, while you're watching the bags, give me...

103
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,330
Can you go on the other side?

104
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,970
The other side?

105
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,490
What do you mean?

106
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,250
Yeah, go all the way down there to the green bag.

107
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,190
And then look towards me.

108
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,430
And then we just wait.

109
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,410
We just wait.

110
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:36,930
Okay, alright.

111
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,890
You need to keep me up to date.

112
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,490
What happened?!

113
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,570
Is Ted still...

114
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,410
Wait, where's Ted?!

115
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,270
Oh, oh boy.

116
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:48,910
That's a long story.

117
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,130
Wait, wait, wait.

118
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,090
No, wait, no.

119
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,690
Where's Ted?

120
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,030
Go back, go back to your position.

121
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,230
Wait, I can't hear you from back here!

122
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,270
Wait, you can't hear me?

123
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,470
No, you're so quiet.

124
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,330
Because of proximity.

125
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,450
Okay, alright, alright.

126
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,470
Yeah, what happened to Ted?!

127
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,950
Well, Ted kind of betrayed us.

128
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,210
He was kind of a spy or something.

129
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,550
I fucking knew it!

130
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,430
I told you!

131
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,890
I told you!

132
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,630
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

133
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,370
But you had a coma.

134
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:21,990
Like, what are you...

135
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,170
I'm not going to ask you why you had a coma.

136
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,970
Yeah, that's why the person with a coma can smell a rat.

137
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,610
Because they had no prior attachments to Ted.

138
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,150
They think I can smell the rat off of...

139
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,610
But of course...

140
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,870
Yeah, but of course you needed to take a nap, didn't you?

141
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,850
It's not my fault I went into a coma.

142
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,190
Like, you can't fucking wake a person up from a coma.

143
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,030
Okay, so what happened?

144
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,290
Wait, stay here and look, okay?

145
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:45,670
Okay.

146
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,490
Stay here, stay here.

147
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:46,930
Okay.

148
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,090
There's a Lancer.

149
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,670
Who the fuck is Lancer?

150
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,290
Who's this guy?

151
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,330
Yeah.

152
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,510
Okay, thank you for the 10,000 bitties.

153
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:55,790
Thank you.

154
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,210
I told you guys!

155
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,450
I knew it!

156
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,450
I knew Ted wasn't...

157
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,110
I knew Ted was not it.

158
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,190
I knew it when Mendo was like, Ted is a spy.

159
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,470
And I was like, why are we still here?

160
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,830
Okay, guys, we need clothes.

161
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,410
Why am I...

162
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,350
Oh, yeah, because I...

163
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,150
I had to prove something.

164
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,050
Okay, I'm gonna steal...

165
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,150
At least I'll have this.

166
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,490
At least I'll have this.

167
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,930
Okay, I'm not naked, guys.

168
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,250
See?

169
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,290
Look, now I'm part of...

170
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,890
Now I'm part of them.

171
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,510
Okay, yeah.

172
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,630
What just happened now?

173
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,710
We just had a marriage.

174
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,650
What?

175
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,170
Right now?

176
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,950
What?

177
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,490
There was a red wedding?

178
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,030
Wait, why wasn't I invited to the wedding?

179
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,410
You could've taken my body.

180
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,750
You could've taken my...

181
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,150
You could've taken my body to the wedding.

182
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:58,890
You could've...

183
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,050
I could've been there physically.

184
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,210
Not mentally, but physically.

185
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,830
Okay, okay, so like...

186
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,550
Who was he getting...

187
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,830
Okay, so who was he getting married to?

188
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,730
You don't even know who the fuck the wife was?

189
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,230
Dude, so...

190
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,950
Do you think this is the only thing that's been happening?

191
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,650
I don't know.

192
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,570
Okay, alright, alright.

193
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,270
Give me the lore.

194
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:27,890
What happened?

195
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm here waiting, looking at a bag.

196
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,810
Okay, but why?

197
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,750
What happened?

198
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,550
I might put you in a coma.

199
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,330
I might have to put you in a coma.

200
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,390
No, wait, but why?

201
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,050
What happened?

202
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,530
Why are you looking at the...

203
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,030
Who are we looking for?

204
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,170
Wait, one guy disappeared.

205
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,170
Oh, no, the guy disappeared.

206
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,190
Their body's gone.

207
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,670
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

208
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,370
That's because they're dead.

209
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,590
Oh, okay.

210
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,530
Okay, so, like, who are we waiting for?

211
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,850
Uh, he's a bad, bad man.

212
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,170
Okay, but, like, how bad is he?

213
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,450
Why is he a bad man?

214
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,450
Well, it's funny to break a roleplayer's base, I think.

215
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:08,890
I don't know.

216
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,230
So, I'm just protecting it.

217
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,910
Alright, there's a lot of stuff.

218
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,930
Oh, here, take this.

219
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,490
Do you know how to use this thing?

220
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,730
I thought we were not allowed to use metal.

221
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,470
What happened?

222
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,530
Okay, so, if you hold right-click, you see that bar disappearing?

223
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,910
That means you're ready to shoot.

224
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:27,570
Yeah.

225
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,450
And then, like, left-click.

226
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,890
Like, try and do it.

227
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,350
Try and do it.

228
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,470
Yeah.

229
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,350
Okay, wait, stop.

230
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,470
Don't spin it, though.

231
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,890
It uses durability, and it's very, very low.

232
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,890
Just stay in here for a second, okay?

233
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:40,330
Okay.

234
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,050
I'm just gonna go check something.

235
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:41,770
Okay.

236
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,610
When did we get a minigun?

237
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,810
What the fuck happened?

238
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,090
I just woke up from another coma.

239
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,510
What the...

240
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:05,590
What?

241
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,890
Even Deku doesn't know what's going on.

242
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,370
He's like, do you mean skull?

243
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,590
I am with no kingdom.

244
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,610
Our age-long war with the Pulgarians is over.

245
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,830
They are our...

246
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,890
Who the fuck were the Pulgarians?

247
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,610
Was I even there?

248
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,330
Did you not read chat at all?

249
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,970
Was I even there for the fucking war against the...

250
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,370
The red... the D we attacked?

251
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,650
What did you say in chat?

252
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,310
Stop fucking shooting me.

253
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,150
That's for me.

254
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,150
Stop fucking shooting me.

255
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,310
I'm not shooting you.

256
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,890
I'm not shooting you.

257
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,550
Wasn't that the war I was in?

258
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,350
Were they the Pulgarians?

259
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,570
Oh, they were the Pulgarians.

260
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,190
So we're allies with the scary people with the guns?

261
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,230
I wake up to another war?

262
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,270
How do I keep waking up to war?

263
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:07,690
How do...

264
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,450
And now I have a minigun.

265
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,670
I...

266
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,470
I woke up...

267
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,510
I woke up...

268
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,090
Yo, this coma fucking sucks, man.

269
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,990
Alright, guys.

270
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,210
I woke up...

271
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:34,370
Hey.

272
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:34,810
Hey, twin.

273
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,350
So I woke up to another war that war...

274
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,700
I got drafted into.

275
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,450
Dude, I might...

276
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,630
I might have to put you in a coma permanently.

277
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,470
Wait, what?

278
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,230
Why?

279
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,870
Why did I...

280
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,190
Why?

281
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,750
Wait, where's the food?

282
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,430
I'm fucking...

283
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,690
Did you just come back?

284
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,910
The worst timing.

285
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,050
Oh, my God.

286
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,010
Why do we have so many pumpkins now?

287
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,210
Like, do we own a farm?

288
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,770
Alright, well, it's time to see...

289
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,250
I might actually do it.

290
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,250
I might actually put you in a coma.

291
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:07,970
No, please.

292
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,950
I don't know when I'll actually wake up again.

293
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,310
I might wake up to a new age.

294
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,370
Okay, alright.

295
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,850
I'm gonna go explore and see what the fuck is going on now.

296
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,130
Alright, let's see how much the world has changed again.

297
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,170
Okay, so they're all right now at the other kingdom.

298
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,370
They're in the other kingdom?

299
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,850
What are they doing at the other kingdom?

300
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,070
Don't worry about it.

301
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,610
How's your health?

302
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,510
It's at 56.

303
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,330
What the fuck?

304
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,290
Here, take this.

305
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,090
Take these.

306
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:42,410
Okay.

307
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,350
Shoot two of them.

308
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,650
Shoot two of them and then save that last one here I gave you.

309
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,390
Alright, alright.

310
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,050
Oh my god, I'm fucking scared to go outside now.

311
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:52,470
One second.

312
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,390
What the fuck?

313
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,350
I'm gonna make some stuff and then we go...

314
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,750
Wait, do we have an AK?

315
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,710
Do we have an AK?

316
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,650
Okay, you just...

317
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,090
You're just begging to get...

318
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,990
No, no, I have the exclusive AK drop.

319
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,370
Please, I just want to know what my skin looks like.

320
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,410
At least.

321
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:12,870
Oh my god.

322
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,790
Wait, where can I get that?

323
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,130
Where can I get the exclusive AK skin?

324
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,610
Oh, you want to know where to get my exclusive AK skin?

325
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:31,110
Well, all you have to do is just watch one hour of my stream and then you can get exclusive AK skin just for Rust.

326
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,110
And I have never seen it before.

327
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,130
I've never seen it, like, actually held it.

328
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,010
So that's why I was wondering.

329
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,270
That's why I want to know what it looks like.

330
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,750
Wait, give me a sec.

331
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,770
I'll show you.

332
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,310
I got one.

333
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,610
Wait, you stole one?

334
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,570
Wait, you stole one?

335
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,050
Oh.

336
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,610
Shh, we don't say the S word.

337
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,210
Oh, you borrowed it.

338
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,170
You borrowed it.

339
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,610
Wait, Blau wants us to go to him.

340
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,630
Yeah, like a friend of a friend.

341
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,250
Blau wants us to go to him.

342
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,690
Yeah, I know, I know.

343
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,090
Take that Mr. Wrench.

344
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,730
Take that Mr. Wrench on the ground.

346
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,150
I'll make a few more.

347
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:06,910
All right, let's go.

348
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,050
All right, let's go to Blau, I guess.

349
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,870
You know what time it is?

350
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,730
It's the Avenger time.

351
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,010
It's time.

352
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,230
I want to see how much the world has changed in 50 years.

353
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,410
We have art now?

354
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,390
Who the fuck is Sha- Sha-Hallod?

355
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,010
Oh, you ha- Oh my days.

356
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,430
What the fuck happened here?

357
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,310
Come with me.

358
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,050
No horses for...

359
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,730
Gathered in the pa- What the fuck is the party bus?

360
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,150
Um, okay, so, uh, okay, so that worm you just saw?

361
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,710
Yeah?

362
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,930
It's like kind of our guy, and you see those- you see these rocks?

363
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,490
Small rocks?

364
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:49,850
Yeah?

365
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,750
Like, all around the snow, there's landmines in them.

366
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,750
Wait, what?

367
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,810
You have to jump over them.

368
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,870
Oh, you just- you just heard that?

369
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,430
You just heard that?

370
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,070
That blew up?

371
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,550
No.

372
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,730
That was someone just walking into a landmine.

373
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,230
No, wait, there's landmines here now?

374
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,250
No, no.

375
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:05,970
Oh, boy.

376
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,310
Oh, no.

377
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,590
Just follow me, you should be fine.

378
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,210
Why is there landmines in our territory?

379
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,790
Oh, wait, it is not- wait, give me a sec.

380
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,170
This way, dude.

381
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:17,870
Okay.

382
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,890
Wait, do I even have your AK?

383
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,650
I should have it.

384
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,610
You have it?

385
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,470
Wait, do you have it?

386
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,070
Can you skin it?

387
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,810
I don't know.

388
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,150
I never made it, so I don't know!

389
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,250
Uh, go- interact with this repair bench.

390
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:31,970
Yeah?

391
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:32,970
Oh, I see it!

392
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,570
I see it!

393
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,110
I don't know this item's blueprint.

394
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,050
Then you just grab it.

395
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,470
Grab the AK.

396
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,430
Wait, I can just grab it?

397
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:39,930
Just grab it.

398
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,630
Oh, shit!

399
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,190
Yeah.

400
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,290
Alright, guys, look.

401
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,850
There's my gun.

402
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,170
Right here.

403
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,430
How do I inspect it?

404
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,650
What button do I press?

405
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,170
M?

406
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:52,970
N?

407
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,070
Oh, okay, guys, look.

408
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,890
There it is.

409
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,950
If you watch one hour of this stream, you can actually get this AK, guys.

410
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,890
Look at this.

411
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,170
It's right here.

412
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:04,570
Whoa!

413
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,390
We're going to war.

414
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,130
Oh!

415
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,030
We gotta go.

416
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,290
Oh, we gotta go, go.

417
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,830
Just put the AK up here.

418
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,470
Wait, why can't I bring it?

419
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,610
They'll never know.

420
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,490
Alright, it's fine.

421
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,510
You got the minigun, right?

422
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,430
Yeah, I got the minigun.

423
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,230
Alright, let's go, let's go.

424
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,070
Alright, to war.

425
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,570
I get drafted to another war, I guess.

426
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,350
Well, that's why...

427
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,510
It's a forever skin.

428
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,070
You get it forever, guys.

429
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,130
You get to keep it forever.

430
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,110
We finally get to touch the skin.

431
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,930
Guys, we are straight into war.

432
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,810
Well, I'm ready.

433
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,850
I'm ready to go straight...

434
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,030
What?

435
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,150
Oh, my God.

436
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,790
I hope those...

437
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,090
Are those helicopters people?

438
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,190
Yeah, they're with us.

439
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,130
Oh, okay.

440
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,090
They're with us?

441
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,270
Oh, hey, there's a polar bear.

442
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,010
Oh, there was a polar bear.

443
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,510
If I just randomly knock you out, just know there's a reason.

444
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,670
There's a reason?

445
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,490
Wait, why?

446
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,250
What did I do?

447
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,870
I literally...

448
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,990
I just got up.

449
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,090
What?

450
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,090
I just got up.

451
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,510
Remember, watch out for these small rocks.

452
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:22,950
Wait, wait, wait.

453
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:23,850
Just watch out, okay?

454
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,590
What?

455
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,810
It could be any one of these rocks.

456
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,970
Oh, my God.

457
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,990
I need to follow your footprints.

458
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,450
Oh, my God.

459
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,170
Why did you guys mine up the entire area?

460
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,670
Oh, my God.

461
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,590
Guys, now I can look at the floor.

462
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,010
I could blow up at any second.

463
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,290
Honestly, I ask that question every day.

464
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,290
Oh, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

465
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:48,810
Wait, what?

466
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,710
You see that right there?

467
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:49,890
Yeah.

468
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,970
You see that little brown piece?

469
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,510
Yeah.

470
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,970
That's a landmine.

471
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,330
That's a landmine?

472
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,890
Shoot it.

473
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,530
So, try...

474
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,110
No, stand on top of it.

475
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,650
No.

476
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,270
You don't die.

477
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,230
Just stand on top of it.

478
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,930
No, I know.

479
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,430
That's a landmine.

480
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,510
Did you hear that?

481
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:04,990
Yeah.

482
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,250
Did you hear that?

483
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,650
That little...

484
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,390
Yeah.

485
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,490
Okay, so now come over to me and then pick it up.

486
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,410
Otherwise, I can't move.

487
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:13,570
Oh.

488
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,910
Oh, there you go.

489
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,230
Thank you.

490
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:15,710
Oh, my God.

491
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,690
Okay, and then I put it...

492
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,210
Okay, there you go.

493
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,170
Oh, my God.

494
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,450
That's so fucked up.

495
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,930
That is actually so fucked up.

496
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,290
That's so fucked up.

497
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,290
The amount of times I've died...

498
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,170
Who planted all these mines?

499
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,890
Who was it?

500
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,990
I think everybody started doing it.

501
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:38,970
Everybody?

502
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,970
Yeah, I don't even know.

503
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,650
Oh, my God.

504
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,690
Alright, who are we going to war now?

505
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,630
Who are we going to war with this time?

506
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,530
DJ Claw.

507
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,410
Alright.

508
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:56,570
Okay.

509
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,410
Wait, why am I seeing...

510
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,370
Wait.

511
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,310
Wait, why is Felicity and Elim in a car?

512
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:03,730
Wait.

513
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,170
Why are they in a car?

514
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:05,550
Did you get them?

515
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,090
Is that them?

516
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,590
Wait, the people that got kidnapped are in that car.

517
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,350
Elim, is that you guys?

518
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,210
Can they hear us?

519
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:14,990
Wait, wait.

520
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,370
Is that them under the kidnappers?

521
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,830
I can't tell if they got freed or what's going on here.

522
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,250
I honestly can't tell.

523
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,170
Wait.

524
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,170
Wait.

525
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,050
Are they...

526
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,310
Wait, is that...

527
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,410
Wait, are we supposed to save them?

528
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,250
I...

529
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,110
Honestly, when I heard Elim got kidnapped, I was kind of...

530
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,390
Honestly, I was kind of relieved.

531
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,610
But I guess we gotta...

532
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,090
I mean, they got foolish as well.

533
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,930
And I think he's the useful one.

534
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,990
Oh, right.

535
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,170
Yeah, I think we gotta save the...

536
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,990
We gotta save the one that's actually useful.

537
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,930
Well, I mean, I guess Elim is just there with him, so...

538
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,470
Yeah, like, he's just like the plus one.

539
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,250
We gotta pick.

540
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,550
We just pick foolish, right?

541
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,710
We just pick foolish if we have to pick.

542
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,530
Wait, I think they were kidnapped.

544
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,070
I think we literally just saw the kidnappers.

545
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,370
Wait, let me...

546
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,810
Let me talk in team.

547
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,790
Team chat.

548
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,770
Let me type in team chat.

549
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,170
So, like...

550
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,970
Wait, was that them?

551
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,950
Was that just them?

552
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,950
Did they drop them off?

553
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,450
Oh, okay.

554
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,890
Yeah, was that...

555
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,370
I think those were the kidnappers.

556
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,930
I think they dropped them off.

557
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,410
No, no, no, no, no.

558
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,550
It wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't.

559
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,910
I thought it was.

560
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,810
It's not this kid.

561
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,250
I thought it was, but it's not.

562
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,230
Oh my god, they ran over a bear.

563
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,910
Honestly, I'm so confused.

564
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,670
I don't even know what's going on.

565
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,110
I'm gonna wait.

566
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,190
Let me type in team chat real quick.

567
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,330
I don't even know.

568
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,670
Did we...

569
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,910
Are Ellum and Foolish still kidnapped?

570
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,970
We just saw their car.

571
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,990
We just saw their...

572
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,830
Yeah, that was...

573
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,230
We literally saw their car.

574
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,530
We literally just saw them drive by.

575
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,350
That's hilarious.

576
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,610
Oh, we saw...

577
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,710
We saw them.

578
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,510
Whoops.

579
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,510
Catch your breath.

580
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,610
Yeah, I'm catching my breath.

581
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,610
I'm catching...

582
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,350
We're good.

583
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,730
Well, bye.

584
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,570
Was that them?

585
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,770
Okay, so those were the kidnappers.

586
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,170
That's the kidnappers.

587
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,230
And that was Foolish and Ellum.

588
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,770
I'm not sure what's going on.

589
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,170
I'm as confused as you are.

590
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,550
We saw...

591
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,950
Wait, give me like a minute.

592
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,470
I gotta think.

593
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,830
I don't even know what the fuck is going on.

594
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,870
Well, bye Ellum.

595
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,450
They just went to our camp.

596
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,770
What the fuck is going on?

597
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,790
Can we run the other way?

598
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,730
I mean, they're at our camp now.

599
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,030
Why are they doing it?

600
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,030
But they're still kidnapped.

601
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,490
They said they're still kidnapped.

602
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,850
I feel like you right now.

603
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,290
I actually don't know what's going on.

604
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,010
We should landmine the road.

605
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,570
We should...

606
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,230
Wait, be careful.

607
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,150
You might stand on a landmine.

608
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,030
Hey, worry about yourself, okay?

609
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,350
Oh, alright.

610
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,410
If you stand on a landmine.

611
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:51,910
Oh,

612
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,290
now you're paranoid.

613
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,670
Now you're paranoid.

614
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,710
You don't want to have...

615
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,930
It wasn't a coma, okay?

616
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,210
Yeah, but you know just as much information as me right now.

617
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,390
Like...

618
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,710
We're so lost, guys.

619
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,690
We're so lost.

620
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,930
Wait, wait, is that them?

621
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:16,430
That's them.

622
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,670
Yeah, turn it off.

623
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

624
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,910
That's them.

625
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,710
That's them over there.

626
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,370
This way, this way, this way.

627
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,430
Watch out, watch out for the rocks.

628
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,970
Did they throw them off?

629
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:33,870
Wait, I'm going to shoot them.

630
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,410
I'm going to shoot them.

631
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,410
They're looking.

632
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:41,890
They're looking.

633
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,050
They're confused.

634
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,170
Do I shoot back?

635
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,010
Okay,

636
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:03,590
look.

637
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,510
This is a minigun.

638
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,590
This is...

639
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,350
I don't know how to control this.

640
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,990
They shot back!

641
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,430
They're shooting back!

642
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,330
They're shooting back!

643
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,390
Follow me, follow me.

644
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,010
We gotta go this way.

645
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,450
Spray and pray.

646
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,250
Spray and...

647
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,750
I think I hit somebody.

648
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,850
Good shit, good shit.

649
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,420
Can I get it in?

650
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,760
Wait.

651
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,780
You guys are alive!

652
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,300
Wait, you guys are alive!

653
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,120
What happened?

654
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,280
It was bad, guys.

655
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,540
We shot them off.

656
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,660
Was that a good thing?

657
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,180
It was bad.

658
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,100
It did go bad.

659
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,860
Guys, they made it.

660
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,440
Yeah, we just shot at them.

661
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,560
They ripped up the wedding papers and then Coconut forced me to marry him.

662
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
Even kissed me on the lips.

663
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:01,980
Oh!

664
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,540
We're married!

665
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:03,940
Yeah.

666
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm married to Coconut!

667
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,220
Yeah.

668
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,540
Wait, I need to be sad.

669
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,140
Wait, what's wrong?

670
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,400
What's wrong with marrying Coconut?

671
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,400
What's wrong?

672
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,240
They're bad people.

673
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,740
Oh, wait!

674
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,200
We're allied with them?

675
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,840
But if we kick you out, then we're not allied with them anymore.

676
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,800
Oh, I guess.

677
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,600
Yeah.

678
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,920
If we kick out Ellen, for the greater good.

679
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,500
You don't have to be allied.

680
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,320
Like, if you care about us.

681
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,700
Yeah.

682
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,880
If you care about us, you'd leave our group.

683
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,340
It's time to leave.

684
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,060
Wait, you got a fine-ass fit.

685
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,100
What the hell?

686
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
If that's what has to be done.

687
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,060
It was like a wedding gift.

688
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,700
If you...

689
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,900
If you hate them as much as we do, you would sacrifice yourself for the greater good.

690
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,480
I got married too, actually.

691
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,320
Wait, wait, wait.

692
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
Who did you get married to?

693
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,720
He's also married to the DJ.

694
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,200
Fuck, I...

695
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,640
I don't remember.

696
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,760
Who did I get married to?

697
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,100
Wait, who did you get married to?

698
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,140
I got married to Pang.

699
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,280
Oh, Pang!

700
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,120
Okay, but you're useful, so like...

701
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,320
Okay, then we have a problem.

702
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,240
Then we have to...

703
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Then we have to keep you two, so...

704
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,300
I mean, like, how do you get divorced?

705
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,540
How can we get...

706
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,240
If we kill off Coconut...

707
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,720
If we kill Coconut, does that mean you guys are divorced, technically?

708
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,740
I don't know.

709
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,320
Cause like, you're not married if they're dead.

710
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:41,580
No.

711
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,100
So, that should be how...

712
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,320
It's death do us part!

713
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,420
Then death will do you a part!

714
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,400
That's what it means!

715
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,880
Till death do us part!

716
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,000
Wait, do you need snacks?

717
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,640
Do you need snacks?

718
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,580
No, I'm good.

719
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,520
I'm good.

720
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,100
Oh my god, there's frog chairs?!

721
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,640
Wait, this place has...

722
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,560
Wait, was this the wedding?

723
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,620
It was the wedding.

724
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,600
This was the wedding?

725
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,000
Doggie, lock in, lock in.

726
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,480
It was the wedding.

727
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,540
Oh, this was the wedding.

728
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,420
Yeah, lock in, lock in, okay?

729
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,780
This is such a beautiful...

730
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,840
And I wasn't even invited.

731
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,800
I was literally next door to the wedding.

732
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,160
Dude.

733
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,300
You were invited, but you were napping.

734
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,740
I was literally next door.

735
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,340
Oh my god, look at all these frog chairs.

736
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,680
That means we're married.

737
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,840
Wait, what?

738
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,180
There's no priest.

739
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,940
There's no priest here.

740
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,880
Alright, so okay, now I've been filled in on the lore.

741
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,900
I've been filled in on the lore now.

742
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,920
LM has been forced to leave the Lurkings by...

743
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,100
They blamed you!

744
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,080
They blamed you!

745
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,700
Nice.

746
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,440
Never my fault.

747
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,000
It's never my fault.

748
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,280
Wait, there's somebody over outside.

749
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,440
Who's that over there?

750
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,060
Wait, there he is.

751
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,360
No, he doesn't have...

752
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,660
LM!

753
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,140
LM!

754
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,920
Come back!

755
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,900
Wait, is it actually better?

756
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,060
LM!

757
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,840
LM, come back!

758
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,000
We have a plan!

759
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,680
We have a plan!

760
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,500
Wait, we do?

761
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,340
Till death do us part!

762
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,140
We just gotta kill Coconut!

763
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,020
LM!

764
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,180
LM!

765
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,160
LM, get your ass over here!

766
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,900
Where the fuck is he?

767
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,740
LM!

768
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,160
LM!

769
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,840
LM, stop!

770
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,260
Don't do it!

771
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,140
LM, you have so much to live for!

772
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,340
LM!

773
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,620
No, we have a plan, LM!

774
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,240
LM!

775
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,780
You know in marriage, in marriage, you know the whole thing?

776
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,280
Till death do us part?

777
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,200
We just need to kill Coconut.

778
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,540
And then death will separate you.

779
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,760
So there's a chance?

780
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,760
There's a chance!

781
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,500
You just gotta kill Coconut!

782
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,360
You gotta lure him!

783
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,660
And then kill him!

784
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,520
Cause you're married, right?

785
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,340
So then as a married couple, you can lure him to a secluded place.

786
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,780
And then we'll kill him.

787
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,580
And then you're legally separated because till death do us part.

788
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,210
That's basically it.

789
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,690
And that's how you fix marriage.

790
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,530
Are you ready to kill your husband?

791
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,530
Can you do it?

792
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,690
Can you look into his eyes and stab him?

793
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:17,610
Alright.

794
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,090
Alright, message him.

795
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,250
Take him to a secluded place.

796
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,010
Say that you wanna go on a honeymoon with him.

797
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,650
Listen.

798
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,550
Tunnels are banned, okay?

799
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,110
No tunnel things, okay?

800
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,830
Let's go.

801
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,690
All you have to do is tell him you wanna go on a honeymoon.

802
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,430
Then lead him to a secluded area.

803
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,150
I think that's the car that they kidnapped him in.

804
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,250
Wait, what?

805
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,050
That's the car.

806
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,970
It's not that one.

807
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,750
It's not that one?

808
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,070
That's not the kidnapper car?

809
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,770
Alright, how are you gonna lure a coconut?

810
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,590
How are you gonna do it, LM?

811
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,750
I don't know.

812
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,910
I don't know.

813
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,850
Do you not even have like private messages with your husband?

814
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,070
No, I was forced into it.

815
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,110
Yeah, but you're still married.

816
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,370
He made me do it, donkey.

817
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,890
Yeah, but like, now you gotta do a couple things.

818
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,050
What a bad husband.

819
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,530
What a bad husband.

820
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,450
You know what?

821
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,130
I'm gonna message Coconut for you.

822
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,130
Coconut, where are you?

823
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,850
Your husband misses you.

824
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,920
There we go.

825
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,930
There, maybe he'll reply back.

826
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,050
This is very poor communication.

827
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,930
I don't even know what's going on.

828
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:56,970
And I've been here the whole time.

829
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,260
I gotta save their marriage and then break it.

830
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,070
Bro, your husband isn't even responding to me.

831
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,750
He wants to talk to you, LM.

832
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,050
Live, laugh, love.

833
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:18,950
Okay.

834
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,210
I'm like scared of walking through this area now.

835
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,650
Everything is a landmine.

836
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,870
Everything is literally a landmine.

837
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,770
Where do I go?

838
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,380
Are you fucking serious?

839
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,560
There's landmines within the headquarters.

840
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,140
Where is, where is, which rock?

841
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,290
I don't know.

842
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,310
I woke up and there's war and now, like, what's going on anymore?

843
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,410
I'm too scared to travel because there's landmines everywhere.

844
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,990
Oh, ow, my toes.

845
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,850
Where are these new people?

846
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,150
Landmines, so many bullets, so many bodies.

847
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,810
Oh, my God.

848
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,290
Like, we're...

849
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,930
Okay, alright, so...

850
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,630
Alright, so...

851
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,570
We're back here.

852
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,350
What happened?

853
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,230
Wait, did you guys, what happened?

854
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,350
What, what, what happened?

855
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,850
I'm shaking and afraid.

856
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,410
I'm naked and afraid.

857
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,890
Did you guys all die?

858
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,090
People were getting inside.

859
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:11,890
I can't even...

860
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,150
We were almost lost in clothes.

861
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,630
I killed a couple of them.

862
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,450
They got to the TC.

863
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,690
Yeah, but I had to protect them while you guys were gone.

864
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,010
They kept coming.

865
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,770
We found element foolish.

866
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,510
They got married.

867
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,410
Yeah, so they got married.

868
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,210
Yeah, Ellen's trying to plan to murder Coconut now.

869
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,450
So, like, he's doing that right now.

870
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,790
Oh, my God, I hate Coconut.

871
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,910
Where's Blau?

872
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,670
Sir Ellen, where's Blau?

873
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,490
We tried.

874
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:50,570
We tried.

875
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,010
Blau is still dying for you, Sir Ellen.

876
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,870
I rallied the North for you, brother.

877
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,270
We tried.

878
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:02,970
The blood that was spilled, the families that were sacrificed in your honor to retrieve you and your wife.

879
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,430
Lord Elo.

880
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,450
Lord Elo, have you married to the enemy?

881
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:13,910
Wait, what?

882
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,630
He's married to Coconut.

883
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,630
No.

884
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,850
He's married to Coconut now.

885
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,570
We sacrificed so much.

886
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,590
Yes, Blau.

887
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,110
We have to kill Coconut.

888
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,810
Till death do us part.

889
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,250
Yes, you have unified the North, Sir Ellen.

890
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,770
Egregious attack upon the Coldstone.

891
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,870
The sacrilege the House Dijon Claw has committed, as well as our first unification.

892
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,330
I feel like I just showed up in, like, season 5, episode 30.

893
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,410
You will never forget what Dijon Claw did here today.

894
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,680
Exactly.

895
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,640
You're just hanging out up there.

896
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,520
Well hung, I see.

897
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,060
Elam, what about the countless souls?

898
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,160
Nice, nice.

899
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,280
What about the countless souls that were sacrificed in your marriage's honor?

900
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,540
Are you just gonna throw them away?

901
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,020
Are we just gonna brush them off like they're dust in the wind?

902
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,400
This does not sit well with me.

903
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,180
We fight back.

904
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,660
We fight back.

905
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,920
Why are you mirroring the enemy?

906
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,220
I know how you feel, Lord Shaki, but listen.

907
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,420
Lord Elam was the only reason why we even got Lord Blau back in the first place.

908
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:36,740
What?

909
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,640
So Coconut just went for a second Lord of Command.

910
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,760
Coconut just hurt my mental.

911
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,500
I'm pretty sure Lady Dookie has no idea what the fuck is going on.

912
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,560
Guys, I just woke up from a coma, guys.

913
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,740
Everyone...

914
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,840
Lore speedrun recap time.

915
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,560
Madam Dookie, listen.

916
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,880
Many years ago, we have fought a battle called Skyfall.

917
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:11,680
We have rained down from the flying mythical beast dragon with parachutes, bows, and swords.

918
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,780
Led by the commander, Lord Blau.

919
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,520
What did we kill him?

920
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,320
What did we just kill?

921
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,800
We killed Foolish.

922
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,820
Alright, Dookie, listen.

923
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,020
So what happened was, Elam was getting married.

924
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,220
We all went to the wedding.

925
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,340
The wedding was a bloodbath.

926
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,200
It was an insanely horrendous accident.

927
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,880
The incident that happened, everybody was dying.

928
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,220
There was bodies flying.

929
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,340
There was blood raining from the skies.

930
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,040
We partnered up with Paulgarians.

931
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,940
We were going to take them back.

932
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,140
They were kidnapped by Coco.

933
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,100
Him, Foolish, and...

934
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,820
Wait, who did you get married to?

935
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,300
You, no?

936
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,960
Okay, Uni.

937
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,860
So Uni, they were all kidnapped by Coco.

938
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,180
We, all of us, we joined together.

939
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,780
We were in the bang bus.

940
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,600
And we traveled very far.

941
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,800
We got there.

942
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,880
We set war.

943
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,960
We set fire amongst their city.

944
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:10,520
And apparently, Elam got married to the enemy and let his wife die.

945
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,140
And now we're here.

946
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,340
Our families, our friends spilled blood on the battlefield.

947
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,680
Body parts were flying.

948
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,480
People were dying.

949
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,380
I am all for blaming Elam.

950
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,740
I want you guys to know something, okay?

951
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,000
Elam, as a Lord Commander, is absolutely useless.

952
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,060
Elam does absolutely jack shit.

953
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,220
Wait, Coconut, the guy from that story you were telling.

954
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,380
There he is.

955
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,180
He's in that story.

956
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,440
What are you doing here?

957
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,260
Denounce your marriage.

958
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,900
I loved you.

959
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,660
I loved you.

960
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,280
I took you in as my husband.

961
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,440
And then your people attacked me after I let you go.

962
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,020
Consider this a warning.

963
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,580
We're coming to burn all this shit down.

964
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,500
We gotta call Red.

965
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,460
We gotta call Red, guys.

966
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,580
Guys, we gotta call Red.

967
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,220
We need help.

968
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,400
We need to go ask Pogarians.

969
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,340
Help us.

970
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,960
My Lord.

971
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,740
My Lord.

972
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,340
My Lord.

973
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:13,900
My Lord.

974
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,860
This is bad.

975
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,200
My Lord, this is bad.

976
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,060
We need to prepare.

977
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,780
My Lord.

978
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,340
My Lord, this is bad.

979
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,820
What do we do?

980
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,680
We have no ammunition.

981
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,780
What do we do?

982
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,220
We have no crossbow.

983
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,400
We're all out.

984
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,220
Oh my God.

985
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,620
I just...

986
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,460
I just...

987
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:38,500
I...

988
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:38,620
I...

989
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,820
I just...

990
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:39,900
I just...

991
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:39,980
What?

992
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh my God!

993
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,460
Okay.

994
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,420
Okay.

995
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,880
Everybody calm down.

996
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Clearly, everything will be fine.

997
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,720
Right?

998
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,440
Right, Jackie?

999
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,980
Everything will be fine, right, Jackie?

1000
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,180
Everything.

1001
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,220
Theo died.

1002
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,160
I watched Theo die right in front of me.

1003
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,460
Guys, I don't think everything is going to be fine.

1004
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,320
Right?

1005
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,100
I don't think we...

1006
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,620
I think I ruined the peace talk.

1007
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,460
Wait.

1008
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,360
Guys, I think it was me and Jackie's fault.

1009
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,240
I think it was me and Jackie's fault.

1010
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,160
I think I actually...

1011
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,900
I think I ruined the peace talk.

1012
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,140
I am so sorry.

1013
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,000
We have no weapons.

1014
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,660
We're out.

1015
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,800
But my father only lived until he was 50!

1016
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,900
How can we live for a thousand years?

1017
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,140
Oh my God!

1018
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,920
I started this war!

1019
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,120
And they don't know!

1020
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,760
We must go contact the Bulgarians.

1021
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,340
I actually started this war!

1022
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,200
Oh no!

1023
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,980
They don't know.

1024
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,020
They don't know it was me all along.

1025
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,800
They don't know.

1026
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,040
I don't say a word.

1027
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,680
I won't say a word.

1028
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,360
Don't say anything, Doki.

1029
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,300
They don't know.

1030
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,500
They don't know it was me all along.

1031
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,080
They don't...

1032
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,840
Guys, I...

1033
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,160
Guys, I need to tell Dakin.

1034
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,960
Guys, I don't think they know it was me.

1035
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,700
I need to...

1036
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,220
I need to go tell Dakin.

1037
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,940
We gotta keep our mouths shut.

1038
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,720
We gotta...

1039
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,640
We gotta keep it shut.

1040
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,900
We gotta...

1041
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,740
We gotta get our stories right.

1042
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,540
We gotta get it right.

1043
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,430
Alright, we have to...

1044
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,180
We have to get our stories straight.

1045
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,820
The moment we get our stories straight, then it'll be fine.

1046
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,240
We'll be fine.

1047
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,360
Yeah?

1048
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,120
I've got something to admit to you, Doki.

1049
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:00,960
What is it?

1050
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,400
My wife...

1051
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:02,640
Yeah?

1052
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,440
Gunned down in broad daylight.

1053
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,160
Yeah?

1054
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,580
I looted her body for 500 scrap.

1055
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,100
I'm gonna take it over to the casino and make it big, man.

1056
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,900
This is your last day.

1057
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,200
Before we die...

1058
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,580
Before we die, you're gonna get...

1059
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,960
You're gonna get...

1060
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,660
Dakin, Dakin, we started a war.

1061
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,400
Dakin, Dakin, Dakin.

1062
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,980
We gotta keep our stories straight.

1063
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,640
When we shot them, it was our fault.

1064
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:28,980
Right, right.

1065
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,220
Um, LM, by the way, even though you...

1066
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,160
I mean, you're probably gonna die anyway, so I'm gonna just tell you.

1067
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,960
I stole Foosley's 3k scrap.

1068
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,200
When she got rogged at it.

1069
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,780
No one's gonna believe you anymore.

1070
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,160
I mean, we're all gonna die today anyway.

1071
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,860
Might as well make some confessions today.

1072
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,300
Dakin, we gotta...

1073
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,680
They cannot know that we started this war, Dakin.

1074
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,380
We can't...

1075
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,260
Wait, okay, Doki.

1076
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,340
What if we leave?

1077
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,000
Coconut...

1078
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,860
We just leave this country?

1079
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,720
Coconut came over and said that we shot at...

1080
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,100
Somebody shot at him when they dropped off LM.

1081
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,320
And now that he's starting a war against us, he's gonna burn everything down.

1082
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,860
We cannot admit it was our...

1083
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,360
We cannot tell them it was us.

1084
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,720
Wait, wait, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1085
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,980
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

1086
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,480
Go, go, go, go.

1087
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,100
We're the reason why they're gonna burn our town.

1088
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,040
It's our fault.

1089
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,880
Go upstairs, go upstairs.

1090
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,380
Come over here.

1091
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,040
Listen.

1092
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,380
Nobody can fucking know.

1093
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,180
Are you serious?

1094
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,240
Is that the reason?

1095
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,040
That's why.

1096
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,180
They literally said we dropped off LM and wanted peace talks, but you guys shot at us.

1097
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,180
And it was us.

1098
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,940
It was us, Duncan.

1099
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,260
We were the ones that shot at them.

1100
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:36,540
Okay, okay, okay.

1101
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,200
Okay, we got two options, right?

1102
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,040
Do we do?

1103
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
What do we do?

1104
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,860
Fight or we can flee.

1105
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,760
We can flee the country.

1106
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,840
We can get some new identities.

1107
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,200
Live a new life.

1108
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,940
We can be ignorant.

1109
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,560
We can be ignorant, right?

1110
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,880
As long as we don't tell them it was us.

1111
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,480
We just deny.

1112
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,860
Yeah, you know what?

1113
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,260
Yeah, you can stay here and fight.

1114
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,220
I'll just flee the country.

1115
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,140
We're gonna leave.

1116
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,580
When you're done.

1117
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm leaving.

1118
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,420
You can stay.

1119
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,300
You're leaving the Lurk League after...

1120
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,040
Okay, I'll leave.

1121
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,460
Wait, can you give me an AK, though?

1122
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,260
If you can give me an AK, I'll leave, too.

1123
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:18,960
Oh, no.

1124
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:19,820
Sorry.

1125
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,460
No, you want to be here and defend, right?

1126
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,920
No, no, no, no.

1127
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,800
I'm fine with leaving.

1128
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,020
I gotta go.

1129
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:25,720
No, you know what?

1130
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,420
No, you're right.

1131
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,360
You're right.

1132
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,380
Maybe it's not worth fighting here.

1133
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,800
Oh, yeah?

1134
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,160
Yeah, I mean, how...

1135
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,640
Okay, I've never encountered the Pagarians, but like, how scary are they?

1136
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,080
How scary are the Pagar... whatever they're called?

1137
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,880
We have a chance, but we need them to call us.

1138
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,120
We need to let them know.

1139
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,900
We have a chance?

1140
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,560
Like, call them.

1141
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,580
Like, what do you mean by call them?

1142
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,000
Are you a spy?

1143
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,580
No, I just got a phone.

1144
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,660
Listen, I'm a businessman.

1145
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,280
What can I say?

1146
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,040
Wait.

1147
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
Were you living a double life this entire time, Dakin?

1148
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:10,840
Listen.

1149
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,380
Listen, it's hard to explain, really.

1150
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,320
Wait a minute.

1151
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,760
Is this why you have all these guns?

1152
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,550
Hey, yeah, I mean...

1153
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,230
Were you...

1154
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,310
You know, if you were there, you know, you would've known.

1155
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:28,830
I mean, it's all...

1156
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,790
Wait, who's calling you?

1157
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:31,330
You know what?

1158
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,970
Wait, who's calling you?

1159
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,310
Hello, this is Dakin.

1160
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:37,530
What's up, Ray?

1161
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:45,410
Um, so, Kogana just dropped by and he said that they dropped off Ellum and Foolish.

1162
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,430
First of all, they're married to DJ Inklaw now, right?

1163
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:53,110
But they dropped them off, and they said that someone shot at them while they dropped them off.

1164
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:57,810
And that's the reason they're gonna try and burn our whole camp down now.

1165
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,110
They're gonna come and raid us.

1166
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,290
So, uh...

1167
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,930
Yeah, they're gonna raid the Lurglings, yeah.

1168
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,540
What's going on?

1169
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,060
What are you listening to?

1170
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:11,760
What?

1171
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,600
Yeah, it's a code fucking red.

1172
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,780
It's a code fucking red.

1173
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,050
Are you sure you're gonna tell everyone?

1174
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,930
It doesn't sound like you are.

1175
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,790
Dakin, there are shots fired.

1176
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:35,810
I will literally jump in there, I'll slap you across the face, and I'll tell everybody if you don't do it.

1177
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,190
Make Jimin call me, ASAP.

1178
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,550
What's going on?

1179
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,590
Alright, bye, miss you.

1180
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,070
Oh yeah, right.

1181
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,170
Yeah, you wanted to stay here.

1182
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,830
No, no, no, I'm fleeing.

1183
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:50,690
I'm fleeing, too.

1184
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:51,470
I'm fleeing, too.

1185
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,170
No, I just heard the first shots of war.

1186
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:53,950
I'm out.

1187
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:54,970
I'm out.

1188
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,050
Ooh, sorry.

1189
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,610
What do you mean, ooh?

1190
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,290
I gotta take my business suit on.

1191
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,910
Wait, what do you mean, ooh?

1192
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:01,650
I'm a busy guy.

1193
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,150
What the fuck?

1194
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,390
I got my business suit on.

1195
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,250
Where did you get all this?

1196
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,790
Listen, I'm a busy guy.

1197
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:09,950
I'm a busy guy.

1198
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,210
What?

1199
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,490
Can you get out?

1200
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,330
Okay, okay.

1201
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:18,390
Can we at least get an AK after everything we've been through?

1202
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,050
Can we at least get my AK?

1203
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:22,350
Hey, listen, you got one of those miniguns.

1204
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,930
They're way better than an AK.

1205
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:25,430
Yeah, but that's my skin.

1206
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:26,510
Scram, scram, get out.

1207
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,310
Scram.

1208
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,170
I can't believe you'd leave me behind.

1209
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,010
It's my skin now.

1210
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,130
You can get on my channel now.

1211
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,150
Scram.

1212
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,150
What the?

1213
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,680
What?

1214
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,620
What happened?

1215
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,980
No, I should have said yes to fleeing the country.

1216
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,820
What just happened?

1217
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,140
You fool.

1218
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,000
Oh my god, wait.

1219
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,040
Wait, maybe I can snitch on him.

1220
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,300
The man who sold the world.

1221
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,520
I...

1222
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,980
We had a minigun.

1223
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,540
You're right.

1224
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,020
You're right.

1225
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,300
I need to find a landmine.

1226
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,200
I can't believe it.

1227
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,120
What the fuck just happened?

1228
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,400
He was never... He lived a double life.

1229
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,430
Wait.

1230
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,870
I don't even know how to get back in.

1231
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,660
The event ends at like 3pm tomorrow.

1232
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,220
Oh my god.

1233
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,520
Everything happened.

1234
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,460
And now I'm all alone.

1235
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,000
I should have fled the country.

1236
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,960
I should have fled the country.

1237
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,140
I need to tell him.

1238
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,480
I need to tell Blau.

1239
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,090
Did you win, LM?

1240
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,110
Did you win it big?

1241
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,410
You never made it?

1242
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,590
Wait, wait.

1243
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:35,710
Do you have an extra landmine?

1244
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:43,510
Oh yeah, nice.

1245
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,090
I need some extra landmines.

1246
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,410
Thanks.

1247
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,150
Oh my god.

1248
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,390
How the fuck did you make this jump?

1249
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,010
I'm gonna do it.

1250
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:04,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1251
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:04,910
I need some landmines.

1252
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,370
Oh, thanks.

1253
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,310
I got him.

1254
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,010
I got him.

1255
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:15,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1256
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,490
Oh, thanks.

1257
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,070
Don't worry.

1258
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,530
I got an idea on where to put him.

1259
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,250
Thanks, man.

1260
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:23,230
Thank you.

1261
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:24,430
I really appreciate it, man.

1262
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,910
Be careful.

1263
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:28,710
Don't blow up.

1264
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:29,350
Don't worry.

1265
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,290
Don't worry.

1266
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,710
I know the map.

1267
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,550
I sure do love living at my house.

1268
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:56,490
What?

1269
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,930
You can't place it?

1270
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:58,950
This is bullshit.

1271
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:00,950
This is actually bullshit.

1272
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:05,550
Hey.

1273
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,770
What are you guys talking in there?

1274
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,870
What are you guys talking over there?

1275
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:11,290
Huh?

1276
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,030
What were you guys talking over there?

1277
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,630
What do you mean, who's we?

1278
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:18,930
Yeah?

1279
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,490
Who were you talking to?

1280
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:27,470
Who was it?

1281
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:28,850
Oh, somebody.

1282
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:29,970
A dirty little secret?

1283
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:36,510
Why not?

1284
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:48,890
Oh.

1285
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,470
Hey.

1286
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:50,930
Whoa.

1287
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:51,630
Whoa, man.

1288
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:51,890
Listen.

1289
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:52,690
It's not what it looks like.

1290
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,370
It's not what it looks like.

1291
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,690
It's not what it looks like.

1292
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:54,950
Okay.

1293
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,150
What is it supposed to look like?

1294
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,810
I was just talking to my...

1295
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,830
Well, man, that's a good question.

1296
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,090
I didn't think you'd ask that question.

1297
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,210
But it's not that.

1298
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:05,030
Whatever you were thinking, it wasn't that.

1299
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,610
What would I be thinking about?

1300
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,210
You know what?

1301
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,090
You have the darndest imagination.

1302
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,090
Anyone ever tell you that?

1303
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:17,830
Whoa.

1304
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,510
You got a big gun.

1305
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:22,730
Yeah.

1306
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:27,950
Wow.

1307
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:28,630
Okay.

1308
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:30,990
Yeah.

1309
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:31,550
Okay.

1310
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:31,870
Fine.

1311
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:32,150
Fine.

1312
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,350
I was talking to my ex-roommate.

1313
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:35,550
Your ex-roommate?

1314
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,130
Why is he back there?

1315
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,810
I don't actually know.

1316
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:47,370
Why is he still hiding inside your house?

1317
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,890
As if nothing is happening.

1318
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:50,990
That's a good question.

1319
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,990
Yeah, why isn't he even saying anything after all of that?

1320
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,270
Why is he putting you in such an uncomfortable position right now?

1321
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,030
By yourself, right here.

1322
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:01,910
So uncomfortable.

1323
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,710
Yeah, isn't it so uncomfortable?

1324
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,250
And he just lets you stand there by yourself?

1325
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,030
It doesn't really work.

1326
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,030
It's like you can clearly see him on the mini-map.

1327
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,390
Yeah, and he's letting you just stand there with this awkward situation.

1328
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,750
And he's not even going to help you.

1329
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,670
He's just doing his own thing in the house.

1330
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:26,410
Yeah, so is he really a good friend of yours?

1331
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,230
No, you're right.

1332
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,090
I'm starting to think that.

1333
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:31,630
Yeah.

1334
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:35,190
I mean, it's just so awkward here.

1335
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,410
Talking to somebody you don't...

1336
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,150
You've helped me realize a lot.

1337
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1338
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:44,970
Like a real person, a real bro, he wouldn't let you just stand there in this awkward position.

1339
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:46,010
Yeah, no.

1340
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:47,370
You know what?

1341
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,130
He'll probably prove himself any second.

1342
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,610
Fine, fine, fine.

1343
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,150
You can flee the country with me.

1344
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:52,550
Are you happy?

1345
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,270
Alright, best of luck, everyone.

1346
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,690
We're actually fleeing?

1347
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,490
We're actually fleeing?

1348
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:07,590
I mean, shit.

1349
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,490
It's definitely on my mind for sure.

1350
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,530
Wait, what the fuck was Foolish doing then?

1351
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,050
Is he also part of fleeing?

1352
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:21,570
No, this is our house, Fookin.

1353
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:22,730
He just lives here.

1354
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,290
We live here.

1355
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:25,910
Yeah, so you're letting him die here too?

1356
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,470
Why the fuck do you have a Minecraft sword?

1357
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:30,010
Well, if he wants to die, he will.

1358
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,330
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1359
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:32,730
What?

1360
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,670
Wait, so you're just going to let him die?

1361
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,790
Yeah, well, I mean, if he wants to die, you know.

1362
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,970
Alright, I mean, that's fine.

1363
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,230
I'm not going to stop asking questions.

1364
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:43,470
Oh, that's true.

1365
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,010
He's like part of the problem too.

1366
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,790
So I guess, wait, how are we supposed to flee the country?

1367
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,290
How are we supposed to flee this area?

1368
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:51,470
We just buy a boat.

1369
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,970
That direction, like 40.

1370
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,850
We can buy a boat and we just flee the country.

1371
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:56,630
We just flee?

1372
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:57,470
That's it?

1373
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:00,410
Is that easy?

1374
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,150
Wait, is that easy?

1375
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,290
Wait, weren't you just assigned a task by Flao?

1376
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,850
To gather loot?

1377
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:10,470
Yeah, I just said yeah, whatever.

1378
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:11,890
Oh, but you're not going to do it?

1379
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,090
I'm just going to leave.

1380
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:13,970
Oh, okay.

1381
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:15,410
Well, I guess we can leave whenever.

1382
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:18,910
I feel like we should watch a little bit of the war.

1383
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,110
At least, like, see what's going to happen.

1384
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:22,730
Aren't you a little curious?

1385
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,650
Aren't you a little curious about what's going to happen?

1386
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:34,850
Huh?

1387
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,150
Aren't you curious?

1388
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:36,910
I don't really care, honestly.

1389
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,810
You don't care?

1390
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:38,670
You don't want to watch?

1391
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,250
I'm just trying to get my money up, you know?

1392
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:41,210
Okay.

1393
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,770
I do it for the thrill, what can I say?

1394
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,510
Okay, okay, you gotta explain to me about the whole business side.

1395
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,850
Like, what was all that about?

1396
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,570
Oh, my days.

1397
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,590
Okay, but can you stop going into a coma every single time?

1398
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,190
I promise, this is the last coma.

1399
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:58,330
This is my last coma.

1400
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:01,550
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1401
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,090
I'm reading something.

1402
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:02,490
Give me a sec.

1403
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,330
It says that starting 12 AM PST tonight...

1404
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,930
Wait, I think there's some event that's going to happen.

1405
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,430
Wait, when is...

1406
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:12,930
Wait.

1407
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:13,530
Like, five hours?

1408
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,130
The rock is under attack.

1409
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:17,110
Wait, this is...

1410
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:17,530
Wait.

1411
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:19,970
They're here.

1412
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:20,570
Wait, really?

1413
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:21,890
Yeah, they're here.

1414
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,930
They said they need you, Dakin.

1415
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:28,310
Oh, my God.

1416
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,050
I guess I can't leave or whatever.

1417
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:31,790
Oh, you're not gonna flee.

1418
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,090
Oh, I knew it.

1419
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,010
I knew you couldn't flee.

1420
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,270
You're weak.

1421
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,690
Sprinklebells, are you here?

1422
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,010
They're weak.

1423
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,310
I knew it.

1424
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,310
I knew he was weak all along.

1425
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,310
I knew it.

1426
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,990
The rock is under attack?

1427
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,310
Everything seems okay.

1428
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,210
Wait, is that the rock?

1429
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,430
Oh, my God.

1430
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:04,970
They're fucking here.

1431
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:06,190
Oh, my God.

1432
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,030
They're fucking here.

1433
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:08,550
Oh, fuck.

1434
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:09,010
They're here.

1435
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:09,350
Run.

1436
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:10,950
We gotta run.

1437
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:11,650
I'm running.

1438
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,030
That was a fucking Terminator gun.

1439
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,090
That was a fucking Terminator gun.

1440
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,070
Here we are, bows and arrows.

1441
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,810
Bows and fucking arrows.

1442
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,190
That gun was enough for 14 people.

1443
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:24,530
What is this?

1444
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,590
Oh, my God.

1445
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,830
Oh, my God.

1446
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,350
The siege.

1447
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,570
Oh, my God.

1448
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,710
Oh, my God.

1449
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:44,710
Oh, my God.

1450
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:45,450
There's nades.

1451
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,270
There's nades.

1452
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,250
There's nades.

1453
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,900
Because I shot first!

1454
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,380
No, I didn't shot first.

1455
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,260
Dakin shot first.

1456
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,740
Oh my god.

1457
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,120
So many deaths.

1458
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,500
I can't believe it.

1459
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,980
Me and Dakin.

1460
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,880
We started for all of this.

1461
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,460
Oh my god.

1462
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,920
We started that.

1463
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,140
My old home.

1464
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,700
Oh, there's a helicopter coming over now.

1465
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:40,040
I...

1466
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,040
I can't believe it.

1467
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,800
This is where I used to live.

1468
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,040
I made this all happen.

1469
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,180
All those gunshots over there.

1470
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,340
I did that.

1471
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,020
It was all me.

1472
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,140
Yeah.

1473
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,920
They won't run this far.

1474
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,160
They won't run this far.

1475
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,970
What, do you think they'll know?

1476
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,450
You think...

1477
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:11,030
They'll...

1478
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,650
They'll know it was me all along?

1479
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:17,930
I must live for my sins, I...

1480
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,270
Oh my god!

1481
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,970
Excuse me?

1482
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,790
Now we have aerial attack?

1483
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,590
Not the air force.

1484
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,070
Oh my god.

1485
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,430
Oh my god.

1486
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,110
Rally the search winkles.

1487
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,590
The journalistic moment.

1488
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:54,910
Oh my god.

1489
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,510
It's our heli.

1490
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,170
Yeah, that's our helicopter.

1491
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,160
I think...

1492
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,780
I'm gonna reconvene.

1493
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:14,120
I'm gonna reconvene with the... with the boys down there.

1494
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,680
With Twinkles and Dakken.

1495
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,800
This is crazy.

1496
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,780
I did all... I caused this to happen.

1497
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,000
I can't believe it.

1498
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,460
I did all of that.

1499
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,990
I can't believe it.

1500
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,310
Oh my god.

1501
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,860
Oh, it's not...

1502
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:51,860
Okay.

1503
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:55,800
Oh.

1504
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:58,860
Yeah.

1505
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:04,390
I'm alive.

1506
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:07,210
I'm alive.

1507
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,030
I made... I just...

1508
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:10,090
I made it.

1509
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,970
I made it.

1510
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:12,490
Yeah.

1511
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,430
I made it.

1512
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:15,190
Wait.

1513
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,350
What is this?

1514
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:21,630
What are you growing here?

1515
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:26,130
Wait a minute, Twinkles.

1516
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,790
Were you living a double life too?

1517
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:31,850
Twinkles.

1518
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:33,430
What is this?

1519
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:36,450
Twinkles.

1520
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:46,330
Okay, hello.

1521
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:46,910
Can you hear me now?

1522
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:50,670
Yeah, we... Were you also living a double life?

1523
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:53,270
No, no.

1524
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:54,130
This is just a farm.

1525
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,030
This was for food for us and...

1526
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,870
Yeah, but why are you holding a gun and change your entire outfit?

1527
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,550
Oh, because we don't have any more outfits.

1528
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:06,670
This is what I had to put on so I'm not cold.

1529
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:09,770
And I got all our guns that we saved for tomorrow.

1530
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,210
Oh, okay.

1531
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,290
It was just gone.

1532
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:13,730
Okay, okay.

1533
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:14,150
Yeah.

1534
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,410
It's a likely story, but okay.

1535
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:19,230
You hungry?

1536
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:19,870
Oh, yeah.

1537
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:20,410
I'm hungry.

1538
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:20,890
Yeah.

1539
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,150
Yeah, I just...

1540
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,770
Just got out of a fucking war.

1541
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,190
There's some potatoes in here in the middle one.

1542
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:27,970
Oh, nice.

1543
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,490
Yeah, I did not expect it to show up that fast.

1544
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:32,590
Yeah, no.

1545
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:34,850
I just, you know, I heard gunshots and I ran.

1546
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,070
So like...

1547
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:38,650
Yeah.

1548
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,070
Yeah, like I don't know.

1549
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:44,530
I saw like 10 people with like, you know, every type of gun possible.

1550
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:47,870
And then I was like, I think we should go.

1551
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,210
Yeah, like I don't think we were gonna live that.

1552
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:55,450
And like...

1553
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:00,590
And like, you know, this is all LM's fault for starting this war.

1554
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,130
He used to have...

1555
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:04,850
You mentioned it.

1556
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:06,410
He did get mad at you, so you know.

1557
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,230
Yeah, yeah.

1558
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,510
It was his fault.

1559
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:09,790
Yeah.

1560
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:14,690
Like, I literally woke up and then like, people started dying.

1561
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:17,750
Like...

1562
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:22,130
Yeah, it started off as a very quiet day.

1563
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,190
I guess I jinxed it by saying, um, today's a calm day.

1564
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:27,750
Yeah, I don't...

1565
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,830
So what's the plan right now?

1566
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:31,090
Like, what...

1567
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:31,990
Whoa!

1568
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:33,610
Who's out there?

1569
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:34,310
Get in here!

1570
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:35,370
Deal!

1571
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,430
1-3-1-3!

1572
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:38,330
Are you okay?

1573
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:39,810
We are live!

1574
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:40,870
You still have your clothes!

1575
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:42,230
I don't feel okay.

1576
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:42,570
Okay.

1577
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,450
Yeah, I found some more.

1578
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,130
Dakin is getting scrapped, so we...

1579
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:51,450
So we can get a boat and just boat away.

1580
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:52,370
We're just leaving.

1581
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:53,670
We're fleeing the country, right?

1582
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:54,530
I'm really scared.

1583
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:55,570
Yeah.

1584
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,130
I'm so scared.

1585
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:58,750
They're dying to the landmines!

1586
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:00,050
Did you hear that?

1587
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:00,270
Who?

1588
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,610
Beautiful bliss of...

1589
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,670
Wait, I have more landmines.

1590
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:04,730
Can we put it outside the base?

1591
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,350
I just put a bunch out there.

1592
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:09,670
They're in the rocks everywhere.

1593
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,010
Okay, okay, okay.

1594
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,550
Alright, so we're all...

1595
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,170
We're all getting a boat and we're leaving, right?

1596
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,530
We're never coming back here.

1597
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:21,230
Right?

1598
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,250
Yeah, I think this is fucked.

1599
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:25,530
I think... I think we got...

1600
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,330
We should like, get new...

1601
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,790
We should just get new identities.

1602
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:30,850
Yeah, I got...

1603
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:31,230
Yeah.

1604
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:33,690
I got it off one of their bodies.

1605
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:36,030
That's the one that shot at us.

1606
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:38,590
Yeah, I got one... I got it off one of their bodies.

1607
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:39,650
Are you guys good?

1608
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:41,130
Yeah.

1609
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:41,650
Is everybody good?

1610
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:42,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1611
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:43,130
I think we can...

1612
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:43,910
I think this is it.

1613
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:44,470
This is the squad.

1614
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:46,890
Wait, wait, wait.

1615
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:47,470
Raise your hands.

1616
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:48,250
I wanna see what you guys got.

1617
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:49,290
Make sure you guys...

1618
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:50,530
Oh, I got a lot.

1619
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:52,450
Okay.

1620
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:53,470
Twingos, you got worms?

1621
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:53,810
Sure.

1622
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:54,570
Wait, can I...

1623
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:54,690
Theo?

1624
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,830
Theo, Theo, loot up, please.

1625
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:58,210
Go, go, go get some stuff.

1626
01:06:58,370 --> 01:06:59,490
Guys, get some loot.

1627
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,130
I don't know what you want me to get.

1628
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:04,070
Just something...

1629
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,150
Something you think that's valuable.

1630
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:07,870
I don't have...

1631
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:10,370
I had... My entire inventory is valuable.

1632
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:11,170
It's only food.

1633
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:13,730
Here, there's nothing.

1634
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:14,490
Oh, right.

1635
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,230
There's... I mean, food is nice.

1636
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,010
Guys, listen.

1637
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,130
Guys.

1638
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:19,130
Yeah?

1639
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:19,850
Guys, come here, come here.

1640
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:20,270
Yeah?

1641
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:21,390
Listen, I cannot die.

1642
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,510
Look, this is what I got.

1643
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,150
I cannot die.

1644
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,310
Oh my god.

1645
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:25,750
I cannot die.

1646
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,610
Oh my god.

1647
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:27,790
Okay.

1648
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,030
Wait, who just stole 1k scr...

1649
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:30,150
Yeah.

1650
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:34,870
That was not me.

1651
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:35,930
You know, my thing is full.

1652
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:36,850
What?

1653
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:37,410
Theo.

1654
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:38,270
Theo.

1655
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:38,990
Hands up.

1656
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:39,890
Theo.

1657
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,710
Theo.

1658
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,830
You're wrong.

1659
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,240
I cannot believe I...

1660
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:45,850
Oh.

1661
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:47,530
I cannot believe this.

1662
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:51,210
Wait.

1663
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:52,950
Don't you?

1664
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:54,450
Horrible.

1665
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:57,230
Horrible.

1666
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:59,870
You're a one, one bad person.

1667
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:01,290
Oh, Theo.

1668
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:02,450
Theo, baby, baby.

1669
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,070
There you go.

1670
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,750
Alright, you guys made it to later.

1671
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:08,670
Yeah, we made it.

1672
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:09,770
Guys, we don't have time for this.

1673
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:10,350
We gotta leave.

1674
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:12,130
We gotta leave.

1675
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:13,030
We gotta leave.

1676
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:14,410
We gotta flee, okay?

1677
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,450
We're so confident when it comes to you.

1678
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:20,570
Alright, wait.

1679
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:21,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1680
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:22,590
Wait, let me look, let me look.

1681
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:23,190
Alright, everybody out.

1682
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:23,590
Go, go, go.

1683
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:24,010
Everybody out.

1684
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,350
Everybody out.

1685
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,350
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1686
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,410
Go, Theo, go!

1687
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,010
They're fucking each other.

1688
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:28,770
Theo, just go!

1689
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,790
Are we going to the left?

1690
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,030
Are we going to the left?

1691
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:35,210
There's a fucking tuna roll in my mouth.

1692
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:35,770
I was...

1693
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:38,250
Guys, I hear gunshots behind us.

1694
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,570
I will never look back.

1695
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:41,870
Yeah, we're fine.

1696
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:42,210
We're okay.

1697
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:44,730
Um, I think I'm having one torch.

1698
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,630
Guys, this is very important.

1699
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:49,390
We don't die, okay?

1700
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:53,890
We have a lot of stuff on us.

1701
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:54,830
I should've grabbed food.

1702
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:56,010
What do you mean?

1703
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:58,290
That entire base was full of Theo.

1704
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:00,250
That entire base was full of food.

1705
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,430
Dude, I'm panicking.

1706
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,630
I'm panicking.

1707
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:05,530
You don't understand.

1708
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,150
I told you they were coming.

1709
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,710
And this is the squad we end up with.

1710
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:10,490
This is...

1711
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,090
This is not the A team.

1712
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:12,950
This is...

1713
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,950
You know what people call this squad?

1714
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:17,790
The Looney Tunes, okay?

1715
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:20,930
This is not the A team right now.

1716
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,550
You're for the Looney Tunes.

1717
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:24,510
You're for the Looney Tunes.

1718
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:26,010
You're for the Looney Tunes.

1719
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:30,770
The Looney Tunes was a good show to watch, so maybe we're not that bad.

1720
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:33,950
Okay, I am...

1721
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,110
Twinkies, you're the first one that dies.

1722
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:36,850
We're offering you.

1723
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:38,210
Okay.

1724
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:39,270
Yay.

1725
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,850
The Z team.

1726
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:41,650
Why me?

1727
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,530
Yeah, because that means it's not gonna be me.

1728
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:46,070
I didn't try.

1729
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:47,710
What do you mean you didn't try?

1730
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:49,830
I thought you had a whole plan and everything.

1731
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:52,790
Oh, frick.

1732
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:53,490
Wait, give me a sec.

1733
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:54,810
I'm not sure if it works.

1734
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:55,230
Uh -oh.

1735
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:56,690
Uh-oh.

1736
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:00,070
We need to get new identities, guys.

1737
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,750
Oh, we got a boat.

1738
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:02,230
We got a boat.

1739
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,830
We got it!

1740
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:03,170
Wait.

1741
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:03,830
Yes!

1742
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:05,130
Wait, hopefully it's enough.

1743
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,130
Witness protection!

1744
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:07,090
Everybody in!

1745
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:07,610
Everybody in!

1746
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:08,310
Witness protection!

1747
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,650
We're all gonna be okay!

1748
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,470
We're gonna leave!

1749
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,470
We're fleeing the country!

1750
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,770
This is basically...

1751
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,610
This is basically a wipe, right?

1752
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:23,910
We're leaving.

1753
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:26,510
We're gonna...

1754
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,290
We're gonna be new people.

1755
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,630
Guys, look to the left.

1756
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:31,950
This is what we're gonna miss.

1757
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:33,110
Oh, man.

1758
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,570
Oh, man.

1759
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,410
I hope I don't go into another coma.

1760
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,810
Oh, my God.

1761
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:43,890
Goodbye,

1762
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:50,150
The Great Rock.

1763
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:52,450
No, our base is still...

1764
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:54,250
Our lab, because my...

1765
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,670
My bed is still there.

1766
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,770
Oh, my bed is not there!

1767
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:01,950
Never...

1768
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:03,470
Yeah, we need...

1769
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:05,770
We need to sign out and be new people.

1770
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:06,670
We gotta...

1771
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:09,410
We gotta go to our team and change our names after this.

1772
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:12,130
You wanna be a Joey?

1773
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:14,990
Yeah?

1774
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:17,850
You wanna be a...

1775
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,830
You could be any name and you chose Kevin.

1776
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:22,270
You could be anybody.

1777
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,770
Out of every name you can pick...

1778
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:32,210
And now you hiding in plain sight!

1779
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:33,470
That's true.

1780
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:34,770
No one wants to be a Kevin.

1781
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:36,870
You're gonna be Jose?

1782
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:41,450
Oh, my God.

1783
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,970
Oh, you're true!

1784
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:46,490
True!

1785
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:49,130
You could be like, I'm new here.

1786
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,110
Like, I'm a...

1787
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,810
Like, I literally just moved here.

1788
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:53,130
Yeah!

1789
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:54,250
You should practice!

1790
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:59,630
Yeah, yeah, you can't speak English, so there's no way we're like, you know...

1791
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:01,510
We're like the Lurklings.

1792
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,290
They'll never know.

1793
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:03,570
Okay, I think you guys should change...

1794
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,650
We should all change our clothes.

1795
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,810
We look very Lurkling.

1796
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:08,550
Do we even have new change of clothes?

1797
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,610
This is literally Lurkling outfit.

1798
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,670
I forgot my suit.

1799
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,270
Guys, I forgot my suit.

1800
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,370
Are we turning back for your suit?

1801
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:26,210
Are you serious, Dakin?

1802
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,210
You think I'm crazy?

1803
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:28,590
You think I'm crazy?

1804
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,010
Hell no!

1805
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:32,390
Wait...

1806
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,610
I'm not dying for no suit.

1807
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:37,530
Wait...

1808
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,590
Why are they all gathering back to the base?

1809
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,050
Did they...

1810
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:41,750
Did they win the war?

1811
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:43,790
Wait, guys.

1812
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:44,830
Check the map.

1813
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,230
They're all like, gathered there.

1814
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:49,610
You think they won?

1815
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:52,730
Wait, do you think...

1816
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:53,510
Do you think the war is over?

1817
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:54,810
Wait, I think they won the war.

1818
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,210
We won!

1819
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:00,270
Okay, everybody.

1820
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:00,990
Okay, relax.

1821
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:01,610
Breathe.

1822
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,110
Okay.

1823
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:03,630
Okay, everyone just breathe.

1824
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:04,770
Let's just take a moment.

1825
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:05,810
Let's figure out...

1826
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:05,930
Guys, guys.

1827
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:06,430
I think we...

1828
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,230
You can't say we won the war when you flee.

1829
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,410
We don't know that.

1830
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:10,370
They don't know that.

1831
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:11,810
We don't know that.

1832
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:12,870
We don't know...

1833
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:13,770
No, no, no!

1834
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:15,070
We're gonna be fired!

1835
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,230
We're gonna be fired!

1836
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:17,430
We're gonna be fired!

1837
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:18,050
They don't know that.

1838
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:18,990
They don't know that we flee.

1839
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:20,810
We don't know we flee.

1840
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:21,550
I don't wanna be here.

1841
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:22,490
They don't know we flee.

1842
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,990
Wait, no!

1843
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:25,490
Jack, wait!

1844
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:26,310
Okay, it's fine.

1845
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:28,490
We remember all the loot you have.

1846
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,370
We drive back.

1847
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:32,570
We drive back and we just say we were part of...

1848
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:33,890
We were part of the war.

1849
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,430
Just...

1850
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:35,810
We gotta get our story straight, guys.

1851
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:36,830
We were there.

1852
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:38,330
We were on a supply run.

1853
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,210
We were all there.

1854
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,070
We were just getting supplies.

1855
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,030
We were...

1856
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,810
We were all there.

1857
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:43,690
We fought so hard.

1858
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,070
We killed...

1859
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:47,590
We killed one guy and that's how I got the minigun.

1860
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:48,790
Just remember that.

1861
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:54,090
We killed him with a crossbow and stole his minigun.

1862
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:54,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1863
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,850
And then we showed them our guns and be like, this is how we killed them.

1864
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:00,610
And we are chasing people that are running away.

1865
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:02,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1866
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:06,490
We were chasing people that were running away and that's why we were gone.

1867
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:10,670
Alright, let's go back.

1868
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:10,950
No, no.

1869
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:11,530
Go back, Jack.

1870
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:12,750
I think they won the war.

1871
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,110
They're all grouped up.

1872
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:16,110
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1873
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,430
I'm not going back until I get a confirmation.

1874
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:22,190
We won the war, Jack.

1875
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:22,650
And we...

1876
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:23,310
Stop saying we won the war.

1877
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:24,090
We won the war!

1878
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:24,970
We won the war.

1879
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:25,930
We didn't have balls.

1880
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:26,670
We've won the war.

1881
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:27,990
We won the war.

1882
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:29,570
We clearly won the war.

1883
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:30,950
Did they really die?

1884
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:32,550
No, look at the map.

1885
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,150
Why is no one responding?

1886
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:35,310
Look at the map.

1887
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:36,690
Yeah, but no one's responding.

1888
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,110
He doesn't get it, Doki.

1889
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:39,050
He doesn't get it.

1890
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,330
No, they might all be prisoners.

1891
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,610
Did we rescue them?

1892
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:43,930
We rescued them.

1893
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:44,430
We...

1894
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:46,750
We could be heroes, Dakin.

1895
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,330
Go ahead, go swim.

1896
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:50,170
Doki, pull up with the minigun.

1897
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:51,210
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1898
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:54,710
I pulled up the minigun, and then I mowed them all down, Dakin.

1899
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:55,570
Just think about that.

1900
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:57,410
Dakin, just think about it.

1901
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,310
We could be heroes.

1902
01:14:58,530 --> 01:14:59,030
Okay, listen, listen.

1903
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:00,090
Listen, listen.

1904
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:01,690
Okay, okay, listen, listen.

1905
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,770
Theo and Doki, you guys can leave.

1906
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:04,890
Twinkles and I are fleeing.

1907
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,370
Twinkles, you wouldn't.

1908
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:07,930
Twinkles, come on.

1909
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,090
Go save him.

1910
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:09,910
Go save him.

1911
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,470
Twinkles, you know you want to save him.

1912
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,590
I like blacking.

1913
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,130
Twinkles.

1914
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,010
I like surviving.

1915
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,010
Twinkles, we won the war, Twinkles.

1916
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,590
You know we won the war.

1917
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:20,390
Get off my boat.

1918
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,190
Get off my boat.

1919
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:24,790
Can you drop us off a little closer?

1920
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,590
Yeah, can you drop us a little closer, though?

1921
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,070
Hey, listen, we gotta go.

1922
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,350
Nope.

1923
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:30,970
That's all you guys.

1924
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:32,410
You guys want to be the heroes all of a sudden.

1925
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,630
No, I'm not saying we're going to be the heroes.

1926
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,370
Okay, I'm not saying we're going to be heroes.

1927
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:37,850
I'm just saying we won the war, clearly.

1928
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,810
Clearly, we won the war.

1929
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,270
I am the...

1930
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:44,550
Yeah, everybody's at home celebrating.

1931
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:45,450
They're all drunk.

1932
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,370
That's why they're not replying.

1933
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:47,130
Yes, yes.

1934
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,850
Look, look, look, look.

1935
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:48,570
Yes.

1936
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:49,730
She told you.

1937
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,030
See?

1938
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:53,690
Look.

1939
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:54,950
He should have believed the whole time.

1940
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:55,470
He should have believed the whole time.

1941
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:56,750
You should have believed in Plow.

1942
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:57,590
See?

1943
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:58,330
See?

1944
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:59,650
You should have believed in him.

1945
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:02,210
Okay, all right.

1946
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,170
Let's get our story straight.

1947
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:04,530
We...

1948
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,910
Oh, we must move all...

1949
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:08,210
Surprise.

1950
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:09,610
Oh, so we got to move anyways.

1951
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:10,950
Oh, okay.

1952
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:12,090
Well, that's fine.

1953
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:12,890
Oh, okay, okay.

1954
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:14,050
Then we can use the boat.

1955
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:14,570
Yeah, yeah.

1956
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:14,950
Okay, see?

1957
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:15,730
I told you we won.

1958
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:16,650
I told you.

1959
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:17,390
No, no, no.

1960
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:19,430
The boat is slower, but I mean...

1961
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,590
No, I knew it.

1962
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:22,510
Where the hell is Helm's Deep, bro?

1963
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:24,110
Listen, but guys, guys.

1964
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:28,090
Okay, we got to, we got to, we got to figure out a story here.

1965
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:28,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1966
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,030
Because people are going to ask where we were, right?

1967
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:30,310
Yeah.

1968
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:31,870
We're doing a supply run.

1969
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:36,950
Yeah, we were just grabbing stuff from the super secret base that we have.

1970
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:37,470
Yeah, yeah.

1971
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,010
And we like bump into some of them.

1972
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,250
We killed people and stole their minigun.

1973
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:40,730
Yeah, yeah.

1974
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,450
Stole their minigun, yeah.

1975
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:42,870
Over here, yeah.

1976
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,450
Okay, that one's not going to work.

1977
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:46,730
We got to come up with something better.

1978
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:47,710
Nah, it'll totally work.

1979
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:53,310
We were chasing after some of the people that were running off and we got a boat to chase after them.

1980
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,370
Then we killed them and stole their minigun.

1981
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,050
It's going to be fine.

1982
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:01,050
The story's going to work.

1983
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:01,930
They're going to work.

1984
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:02,770
Listen, I...

1985
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:06,070
If it was, if it was H2, we wouldn't believe us.

1986
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,830
But Blau will believe us.

1987
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:09,170
Yeah, Blau will believe me.

1988
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:12,910
Blau raided me last time, so he'll believe me.

1989
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,730
How is Gullum?

1990
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:18,410
We're going the wrong way, Daniel.

1991
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,450
No, no, no, this is fine.

1992
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:22,010
Like, right here.

1993
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,590
Let me just go, like, straight east.

1994
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:26,390
Okay.

1995
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:28,210
That's the easiest way for us.

1996
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:29,990
It'll be fine.

1997
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,830
We're going to drop stuff off.

1998
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:32,330
Okay.

1999
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:35,690
We got to walk, we got to walk a little bit.

2000
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,190
Alright, be careful of the mines.

2001
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,770
Aren't mines, like, literally everywhere?

2002
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:39,690
Deal.

2003
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,310
Oh, we're so far away.

2004
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:43,570
There's no, there's no mines.

2005
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:44,910
We're not even close.

2006
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,930
Yeah, we're going to have to go back to our base.

2007
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:50,050
And we have to get whatever we have there.

2008
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:52,150
If it's not completely destroyed.

2009
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:54,770
We'll be fine, guys.

2010
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,290
I think our base is fine.

2011
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:58,790
Everything will be fine.

2012
01:17:59,090 --> 01:17:59,790
Hey, listen.

2013
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:02,490
Me and Dagger were getting shot at when we were running outside.

2014
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:03,750
So, maybe...

2015
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:07,450
Yeah, this, this, this Twinkle Bails here.

2016
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:11,010
We're just, I'll tell him, run down to the, to the, to the head base.

2017
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,310
I did if you could see that.

2018
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,190
I'm right behind you, I'm shooting.

2019
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,550
Everything will be fine, chat.

2020
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:17,810
Everything will be fine.

2021
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:19,150
They don't know.

2022
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:19,890
They don't know.

2023
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:21,510
We try to flee the country.

2024
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:23,890
You don't know, guys.

2025
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:25,830
Because if they know, that's stream sniping.

2026
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:28,330
And that's against the rules.

2027
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,050
You don't know.

2028
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,530
Somebody in my chat said that.

2029
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:40,750
It's funny that you, you're a wire dodger in GTA, considering you're a GTA...

2030
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,450
Uh, in Rust, considering you're a GTA lord.

2031
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,170
Wait, who is that?

2032
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:47,330
Don't hurt me!

2033
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,150
Woah, woah, woah, freeze!

2034
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:50,830
Who's this?

2035
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:52,430
Who is this?

2036
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:55,030
Are you...

2037
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,350
Oh, no.

2038
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:56,370
Hey, who are you?

2039
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:57,630
What?

2040
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:58,770
Are you a loner?

2041
01:18:58,850 --> 01:18:59,630
Are you part of a kingdom?

2042
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:02,850
Freehold?

2043
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:03,250
Oh.

2044
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:04,470
I know, he's chill.

2045
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:05,510
Actually, wait.

2046
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:07,250
Hey, rummy your pockets.

2047
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,210
Hands up.

2048
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:09,130
What?

2049
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:10,230
What, why?

2050
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:12,690
Actually, actually, no.

2051
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:13,970
You know what, you're fine, you're a good man.

2052
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:16,150
Uh-oh, this guy has a gun.

2053
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:17,470
Wait a minute.

2054
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:18,230
This guy has a gun.

2055
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,950
We're part of the D-Gen Claw.

2056
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:21,310
Oh!

2057
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:29,050
You know what, you're chill, you're fine.

2058
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:32,010
I'm on a scrap run, I'm poor.

2059
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,090
You need scrap tea?

2060
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:35,890
Let's fucking scrap out.

2061
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,270
No, no, I have one right now.

2062
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:40,170
Okay, okay, alright.

2063
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:41,390
Bye!

2064
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,250
Twinkle, we're supposed to be bad people.

2065
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:44,990
Don't be friendly.

2066
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,290
Yeah, we're supposed to be bad people.

2067
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,430
We're part of D-Gen Claw, remember?

2068
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,290
If we do all of this.

2069
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,230
Just say we're part of D-Gen Claw.

2070
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:52,630
I'mma shoot, I'mma shoot then.

2071
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:53,430
And miss.

2072
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:54,910
Should I, should I, should I?

2073
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:00,290
He gonna turn around and murder us, Twinkles.

2074
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:02,410
No, you're gonna end up hitting us.

2075
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:03,750
Like, that's bad, that's bad, that's bad.

2076
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:05,790
I've seen your aim.

2077
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:07,010
That's, it's not good, it's not good.

2078
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,270
Wow, wow!

2079
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,170
Damn, where are we going anyway?

2080
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:19,310
Where exactly are we going, guys?

2081
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:27,290
We have a second base?

2082
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:27,810
Okay.

2083
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:34,610
No, please.

2084
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,930
I don't, I don't want to have another lure dump.

2085
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:39,730
I don't need another lure dump.

2086
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,310
Stop, stop going to sleep, man.

2087
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:44,590
I can't.

2088
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:45,850
I get tired.

2089
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:46,690
You're on the job.

2090
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:48,050
I get tired.

2091
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:49,150
I can't!

2092
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:53,030
So, where is our second base?

2093
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,970
I kind of feel like he's lying.

2094
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:58,810
Like, 120?

2095
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:00,530
A hundred and...

2096
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:01,510
I kind of feel like he's lying.

2097
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:03,770
He's just trying to convince us to run all the way home.

2098
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,810
Oh, guys.

2099
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:06,550
I would definitely...

2100
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:07,190
We do have a second base.

2101
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,630
No, we do have one.

2102
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,370
Because they were like Helms or whatever.

2103
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:11,210
N10.

2104
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:12,590
N10?

2105
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:13,750
Helms Deep Throat.

2106
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,830
Oh, it's not even that far.

2107
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:18,090
It's close by.

2108
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,350
How come nobody else is heading there?

2109
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:22,070
Why are they all still there?

2110
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,450
Wait, should we just go to my...

2111
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:25,050
I have a flashlight.

2112
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:27,850
Let's keep moving.

2113
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:31,530
Why is the rest of our group still back at the original house?

2114
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:33,150
Are they...

2115
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:35,070
I think they're gathering stuff over there.

2116
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:35,710
Oh, I see.

2117
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:36,310
Yeah.

2118
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:37,270
No, let's keep moving.

2119
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:37,590
Keep moving.

2120
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:47,720
It's the scientist.

2121
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:48,740
It's the scientist.

2122
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,500
It's fine.

2123
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,180
You're fine.

2124
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:50,700
You're okay.

2125
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:51,640
Save me.

2126
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,780
He shot me in my ass.

2127
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:53,340
You're okay.

2128
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,560
Don't be a little baby.

2129
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,760
Won't be a real DJ Klaus.

2130
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,340
A DJ Klaus doesn't cry.

2131
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:02,760
We're not DJ Klaus.

2132
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,160
Yeah, but that's what we want them to think we are.

2133
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,520
If they think we're DJ Klaus, they won't hurt us.

2134
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:07,940
I'll do.

2135
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,460
Oh, right, right.

2136
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:12,880
Oh, okay.

2137
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:13,620
You're thinking of...

2138
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,160
You're thinking five head right now.

2139
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:15,460
Yeah.

2140
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,260
Yeah, like we bump into other people.

2141
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,620
We got to tell them we're DJ Klaus.

2142
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,520
So they don't hate...

2143
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,700
And it'll be bad people.

2144
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,340
So they'll hate us.

2145
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,440
How does that work because of your clothing?

2146
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:25,400
It's fine.

2147
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,000
We'll just say we killed some Lurklings.

2148
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,440
While we were running by and we were cold.

2149
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,380
Oh, yeah, true.

2150
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:33,940
Yeah, yeah.

2151
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,400
I believe we have another base.

2152
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,860
Like, what the fuck is going on?

2153
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:45,800
Wait.

2154
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,840
Theo, fucking turn off your fucking light.

2155
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,740
Theo, put the light down.

2156
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,780
I'm scared of the fucking dark.

2157
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,920
Now, I'm gonna get hit by a wolf.

2158
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,080
Now, I'm gonna get hit by a wolf.

2159
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:04,920
Theo, Theo, Theo.

2160
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,600
Theo, I'm gonna make sure you see the dark all the time.

2161
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,620
If you don't shut the fuck up.

2162
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,380
What the fuck, Dakin?

2163
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,560
You were supposed to be our boy.

2164
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,560
Yeah, boy.

2165
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,680
That's the only way to leave here.

2166
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,800
You guys, we're done.

2167
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:21,900
What the fuck?

2168
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:22,320
I'm keeping the torch.

2169
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,780
I'm so scared of.

2170
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,260
We're looning, tooning.

2171
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,780
I'm keeping the torch.

2172
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,840
And Dakin, you are the biggest fucking scary cat in the world.

2173
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,880
Is this guy scared of me?

2174
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:33,520
We're gonna die.

2175
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:34,820
We're gonna die.

2176
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:35,980
Guys, guys.

2177
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,000
Oh, my God.

2178
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,480
What is this guy so scared of?

2179
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,920
There's mines here?

2180
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,000
You listen.

2181
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:42,480
Yeah.

2182
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:43,780
We're fine.

2183
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,080
This guy is so freaking out about.

2184
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:46,660
Yeah, there is.

2185
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,340
We're in the mines.

2186
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,320
Guys, I'm stuck.

2187
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,740
Like, actually, never mind.

2188
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,700
The mines are by the front.

2189
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,320
I know that much.

2190
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:58,800
Oh, okay.

2191
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,060
So, there's no mines back here.

2192
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,900
Oh, there it is.

2193
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:04,680
Lorplings.

2194
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:06,760
This is our new home.

2195
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:07,780
This is our other home, right?

2196
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,020
Where are the Glorplings?

2197
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,220
Where are the Glorplings?

2198
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:16,100
The Glorplings.

2199
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:21,940
What's up?

2200
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,800
Wait, so we should put our sleeping bags here.

2201
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2202
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,100
And then this, Tobi, here is the entrance.

2203
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:39,520
Alright.

2204
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,400
Hey, what happened to our sign?

2205
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:43,000
What?

2206
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,660
There's the Glorps.

2207
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:46,220
Is that our mascot?

2208
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,280
Is that not our- I'm not gonna lie.

2209
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:49,840
This looks like a horror game.

2210
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,760
This looks like a horror game.

2211
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:51,560
What the fuck is this?

2212
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,520
What the fuck is that?

2213
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:56,860
Why is there a Dragon Ball over here too?

2214
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,800
The first star Dragon Ball.

2215
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,760
What the hell is going on?

2216
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,000
What the fuck is this place?

2217
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:05,620
I don't know.

2218
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:06,300
Wait, wait.

2219
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,540
We gotta have sleeping bags here.

2220
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,480
Does anyone have extra sleeping bags?

2221
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,240
There's some cloth right here.

2222
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:13,920
I'll make you some.

2223
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2224
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,360
Dude, this is too open.

2225
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,260
How are we supposed to protect this place?

2226
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,180
Well, they can just airdrop and then we die.

2227
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,780
They can just jump on the rock and we die.

2228
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,180
Woah, look at the picture of the Glorplings.

2229
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,040
Wow, it really does look real.

2230
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:34,300
That picture was taken earlier.

2231
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:38,800
Alright, don't worry.

2232
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:39,480
We'll be fine.

2233
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,040
We'll be fine.

2234
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:42,860
Oh my god.

2235
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:45,920
Coconut is like an actual stalker.

2236
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:49,240
You can block me onto my...

2237
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,720
Woah, this guy needs to chill.

2238
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,520
Alright guys.

2239
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,440
DJ Claw.

2240
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:08,580
DJ Claw.

2241
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,800
I just don't know where I would safely put all this loot.

2242
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,080
Because all this loot is worth way more than this base.

2243
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:17,880
I think you should put it far away from this base.

2244
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,480
I don't even think you should put it here.

2245
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:21,920
Wait, wait, wait.

2246
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:22,700
There's another base.

2247
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,320
Follow me.

2248
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:26,380
We have like another mini base nearby.

2249
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:28,900
We can put it there.

2250
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:30,800
Where exactly?

2251
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,120
Oh, up the hill in the snow?

2252
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,560
Yeah, where is the other base?

2253
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,600
Why is...

2254
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,720
Oh my god, there's a bear over there.

2255
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:51,030
There's another bear.

2256
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:52,870
There's always another bear.

2257
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:56,110
Have they all successfully moved yet?

2258
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:10,960
They've all been like gathered in that one area for a very long time and I'm a little worried.

2259
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,140
We gotta go back.

2260
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,140
Ah, they're celebrating because we won.

2261
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:15,480
I'm a little...

2262
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,240
I'm a little worried why they're still there.

2263
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,620
I think it's a big party.

2264
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:23,500
I think it's just a big party that we're missing.

2265
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,900
Yeah, we should go back.

2266
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,480
Wait, do you think they're having a wedding?

2267
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,440
Oh, wait.

2268
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:32,920
Maybe they are.

2269
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,280
Let's go.

2270
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,480
Maybe they're having another wedding.

2271
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:36,680
Dude.

2272
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:46,650
What the fuck is going on over there?

2273
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:48,290
I feel like we should go back.

2274
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:55,030
Where the fuck is going?

2275
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:55,790
Wait, Gumi.

2276
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:59,030
You missed out on a lot, Gumi.

2277
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:00,170
We're in another war.

2278
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:03,430
We're in another war again.

2279
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:04,330
Are we going back?

2280
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,350
I guess we are.

2281
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:09,190
Yeah, I think so.

2282
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:09,510
Fuck it.

2283
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:10,550
Yeah, fuck it.

2284
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:11,170
Let's go back.

2285
01:28:11,650 --> 01:28:12,590
I feel like...

2286
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:13,750
I feel like it was...

2287
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,770
I feel like they're having a party now.

2288
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:17,790
Can't be that bad.

2289
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:18,270
Yeah.

2290
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:21,990
Whoa, that's a bear!

2291
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:22,910
That's a bear!

2292
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:24,110
That's a bear!

2293
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:27,430
I'm so excited!

2294
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:28,190
No!

2295
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:39,110
I get to...

2296
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:46,550
What the fuck?

2297
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:52,690
Now I'm here.

2298
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:03,710
What?

2299
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:05,210
What's going on?

2300
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:05,870
Whoa!

2301
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,630
What's going on, guys?

2302
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:17,070
What's going on?

2303
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:18,270
I feel so bad for Doki.

2304
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:19,150
Here's what we're gonna do.

2305
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:27,450
Okay, I'm gonna give you guys these orbs and I'm gonna walk Doki over to Helm's Deep Throat so she can see our new castle.

2306
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:28,510
Oh no, I saw it.

2307
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,230
I was there and then I got...

2308
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:32,050
I was there but I got killed by a bear.

2309
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:33,170
But don't worry, I'm fine.

2310
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:34,290
Dude, Doki...

2311
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,530
Doki arrived in the peak of like mid RP.

2312
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:39,850
Had no idea what the fuck was happening.

2313
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:40,750
It's like, what?

2314
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,630
This also happened last time.

2315
01:29:43,730 --> 01:29:43,950
Let's see.

2316
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:44,790
Lady Doki.

2317
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:46,570
We...

2318
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:49,910
Oh, this is the audio recording of everything that happened, by the way, Doki.

2319
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:50,490
Oh!

2320
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:55,210
Is that the war?

2321
01:29:56,170 --> 01:29:57,530
Is that what happened?

2322
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:58,010
Yeah.

2323
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:01,030
No, Jed, Jed wants a sacrifice.

2324
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:02,930
Oh my god, Spongebunz, you're here too.

2325
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:03,770
You've all submitted...

2326
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,950
Okay, I'm assigning everyone tasks.

2327
01:30:06,730 --> 01:30:08,670
Yeah, Spongebunz and Doki.

2328
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:14,530
Your guys' missions are to talk to other Lurklings so you can figure out what the fuck has happened recently.

2329
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:16,350
Okay.

2330
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:18,530
Lisa, you...

2331
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:23,870
I guess go to Helm's Deep Throat and start securing it and just...

2332
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:28,550
No, no, me, Dakken, Twinkles, and Theo secured it already.

2333
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,570
We dropped stuff over there just then.

2334
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:32,870
And then I got killed by a bear and now I'm here.

2335
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:34,050
Now I'm here.

2336
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:37,430
Wait, wait, wait, including the Forbidden Armory?

2337
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:41,650
I'm gonna move the Forbidden Armory, don't worry.

2338
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:43,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

2339
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,090
What do you mean Forbidden Armory?

2340
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,230
We have another Forbidden Armory.

2341
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,990
You have another Forbidden Armory?

2342
01:30:55,970 --> 01:30:57,610
There's another one?

2343
01:30:58,410 --> 01:31:01,210
You mean the one where we had 5,000 scraps?

2344
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:05,590
Wait, I said too much.

2345
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,150
No, not that.

2346
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:08,710
Not that.

2347
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:09,310
No, no.

2348
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:10,410
Not that.

2349
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,610
No, I didn't mean that.

2350
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:15,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2351
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:16,710
We'll talk about the Forbidden Armory.

2352
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:18,430
Actually, Lisa, that'd be great.

2353
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:24,470
If you can go to Helm's Deep Throat and make a special, like, reinforcement.

2354
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:26,590
Like, you know that main keep area?

2355
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:29,010
What do you mean by Forbidden Armory?

2356
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:30,030
The biggest building there.

2357
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:31,730
Make, like, an actual...

2358
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:34,010
What do they mean?

2359
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:36,610
The actual high-grade, like, nice...

2360
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,730
I don't know what they mean by Forbidden Armory!

2361
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:40,930
That's your task.

2362
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:42,930
So, Dragon...

2363
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:53,350
Okay.

2364
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:58,730
Why are they still there?

2365
01:31:59,210 --> 01:31:59,490
Why?

2366
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:02,270
Why are they not coming back?

2367
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,970
I need milk animals up there fast.

2368
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:17,970
There was more lore updates in the past 20 minutes?

2369
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:18,830
What happened?

2370
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:30,010
Who's Sven?

2371
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:45,110
You guys are focused on this shit for tomorrow, right?

2372
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,390
Yeah, so here's what we're doing, Sven.

2373
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:52,050
We are abandoning the rock.

2374
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:54,050
It's no longer safe to defend.

2375
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:58,910
Sorry, I just had to do that.

2376
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:01,050
We are going to Helm's Deep Throat.

2377
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:05,250
It's our stone castle that's just north of the important area.

2378
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:07,010
Okay.

2379
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:10,890
Maybe we should build our castle, like, right next to yours, you know?

2380
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:14,010
So we can put forces together.

2381
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:17,210
Yeah, I would also have...

2382
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:18,790
I would have you...

2383
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:20,610
Yeah, maybe you and H shouldn't, like, scout out.

2384
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:22,030
Like, well, actually, you're the main builder.

2385
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:23,490
Yeah, you can figure out where the best...

2386
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:26,810
Like, you know, we kind of built ours for aesthetics, because, you know, that's how...

2387
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:28,690
You should probably build yours to be, like, sweaty, you know?

2388
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,450
No, I'm not building sweaty.

2389
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:34,870
I'm not building anything sweaty this week.

2390
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:37,390
I will build something cool.

2391
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:37,870
But, listen.

2392
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,010
Listen, listen.

2393
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:41,770
I was just called by a spy from Warkonnen.

2394
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,030
Well, Warkonnen's leader just called me, okay?

2395
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:47,430
They have a spy at their gate right now.

2396
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:49,650
And apparently, they're going out...

2397
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:50,530
DJ Klaw, sorry.

2398
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,790
So, Warkonnen has a spy at DJ Klaw's gate.

2399
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,830
Apparently, they're going out for another raid.

2400
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:55,950
Another spy?

2401
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:57,230
They might raid us.

2402
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:57,950
They might raid...

2403
01:33:58,710 --> 01:33:59,170
I don't know.

2404
01:33:59,210 --> 01:34:00,130
They might raid the church.

2405
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:00,690
I don't know.

2406
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:02,870
How many spies are there?

2407
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:08,030
I just want to let you guys know that if they do, we're going to go and raid their gen, okay?

2408
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,270
You can't tell anyone.

2409
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,690
If you tell anyone, we won't win.

2410
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:15,170
So, if that happens...

2411
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:17,950
If that happens, I'm going to write to you something in chat, Klaw.

2412
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:19,150
And you'll know what to do.

2413
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:20,830
Because there's no other way for me to reach you.

2414
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:21,810
You guys don't have a phone.

2415
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,570
You guys don't use that technology.

2416
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,430
Actually, some of us do have phones.

2417
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:25,970
I have a phone.

2418
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:27,150
SirDragon has a phone.

2419
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:27,970
You can...

2420
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:29,350
Okay, okay.

2421
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:30,150
Yes.

2422
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:32,310
If that happens, just know, okay?

2423
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:35,010
We will build a massive siege tower.

2424
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:36,470
On F18.

2425
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:37,750
On the north side.

2426
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:38,850
Top left corner.

2427
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:42,050
What the fuck is going on?

2428
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,730
Just storm the walls with anything you have.

2429
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:45,470
I'm sorry.

2430
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:46,750
I forgot to mute my play.

2431
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:47,630
Just place a bunch of bags around.

2432
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:48,110
I'm sorry.

2433
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:50,250
I'm so confused with the lore.

2434
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:53,210
That caught me off guard.

2435
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:55,150
We're going to fire rockets from our siege tower.

2436
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:58,010
From outside of the wall.

2437
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,750
And we won't push until everything is gone.

2438
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,630
Because we have like...

2439
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:03,350
We almost have like...

2440
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:04,690
Was that the dragon roar?

2441
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,110
I don't know.

2442
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:14,990
If that's the case, if you guys can spare us anything at your raid bases.

2443
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:17,030
The best part about Lurklings...

2444
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,710
I don't know.

2445
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:19,030
We have very strong skin.

2446
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:20,370
We are tough.

2447
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:21,250
So if you guys...

2448
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,110
Not strong enough.

2449
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:24,290
I got fucked over by a bear.

2450
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:26,670
Or just like the most basic weapon.

2451
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:28,210
We can just keep running in.

2452
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:30,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2453
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:31,210
What I'll do...

2454
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,170
What I'll do is...

2455
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:35,190
I'm tied to a fucking bear!

2456
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:36,290
I'll have supplies for you guys.

2457
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,950
Like ladders.

2458
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:37,930
And stuff.

2459
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:40,710
And then I'll have them meet with you guys over there.

2460
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:40,950
Okay?

2461
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:43,490
But if you guys can put a bag there.

2462
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:44,290
Just in case.

2463
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:45,990
Or two bags or something.

2464
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,090
One of you guys can bag everyone over there.

2465
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:48,910
Are you ready?

2466
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:50,710
I don't know if it's happening.

2467
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:52,150
It's like...

2468
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:53,250
I don't know what they're doing.

2469
01:35:53,610 --> 01:35:53,910
You know?

2470
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:57,790
I don't know if you've seen their fortress, but...

2471
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:58,050
Okay.

2472
01:35:58,150 --> 01:36:00,190
I don't know if you've seen their fortress, but...

2473
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:01,150
They got more turrets than...

2474
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:02,230
They got like...

2475
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:03,490
70 turrets or some shit.

2476
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:04,950
They have 70 turrets?

2477
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:05,890
What the fuck?

2478
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,390
Yeah, no.

2479
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:09,590
It's actually crazy.

2480
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,150
How the fuck are we going to beat that?

2481
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,790
Okay, so...

2482
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:13,110
Yeah, I'll...

2483
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:15,290
I'll call SirDragon.

2484
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:15,830
The rats we are.

2485
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:16,890
If it actually happens.

2486
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:18,770
But I just want to give you guys a heads up.

2487
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:19,610
So you know what we're doing.

2488
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:21,010
Because it's going to be very hectic.

2489
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:23,310
Oh, Dak is here.

2490
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:23,630
Okay.

2491
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:24,610
The other thing is...

2492
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:25,790
If any of you guys have...

2493
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:27,530
Extra...

2494
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:28,570
Resources...

2495
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:29,350
That you can spare.

2496
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:31,630
We would love for you to fly them over to the rock.

2497
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:33,090
Fly with...

2498
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,070
Fly with my dragon.

2499
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:36,030
Fly with my dragon.

2500
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:38,270
Okay, goodbye.

2501
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:39,790
Goodbye.

2502
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:45,570
Hello, I'm back.

2503
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:46,570
Do you still have...

2504
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:47,310
Do you have my stuff?

2505
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:53,410
It is time.

2506
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:54,170
I have...

2507
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:54,650
Wait, where are you?

2508
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:59,790
Where the fuck...

2509
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:01,550
What happened to Ella?

2510
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:05,550
She's sleepy.

2511
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:11,170
Wait, we won?

2512
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,690
Like, actually?

2513
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:13,190
I can make another armor.

2514
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:30,430
Here's your minigun back, Ducky.

2515
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:31,490
Oh, thanks.

2516
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:34,430
And the bullets.

2517
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:37,390
Did we kill the bear?

2518
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,110
Did we do it?

2519
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:42,010
Did we kill the bear?

2520
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:43,530
Oh, thank god.

2521
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:44,730
Wait, you didn't give me the ammo.

2522
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:48,690
Theo,

2523
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:55,930
you didn't give me the ammo.

2524
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:57,410
Theo, you have the ammo.

2525
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:58,190
No, he gave me rifle.

2526
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:00,570
Nah, nah.

2527
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:02,190
That's the ammo for it.

2528
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:03,210
No, I got...

2529
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:04,050
Wait, somebody else took it.

2530
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:05,890
You gotta be at a...

2531
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:08,090
You gotta be at a workbench to put the...

2532
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:09,370
It's the 5.56 ammo.

2533
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:10,850
Oh, I have to put it in a workbench.

2534
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:11,190
Okay.

2535
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:13,430
Oh, at least the bear is dead.

2536
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:14,570
You have the ammo on you.

2537
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:16,170
Oh, look at the bandages.

2538
01:38:16,330 --> 01:38:16,750
What the fuck?

2539
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:19,390
Oh, they destroyed our workbench.

2540
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:20,670
Oh.

2541
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:23,810
This way, Ducky.

2542
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:27,050
I'm taking a piss.

2543
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:29,150
Alright.

2544
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:31,090
Our base!

2545
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:32,010
It lives!

2546
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:34,350
Hey, it's still here!

2547
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:37,170
Yeah.

2548
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:39,590
If you jump on the bed, when you're on the bed...

2549
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:39,910
Nice!

2550
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:45,260
So, where's the workbench?

2551
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:45,920
It's going to be on the second floor.

2552
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,300
Alright.

2553
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:50,620
I have to go from here.

2554
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:53,000
Goddammit, I fucking...

2555
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:53,540
You got it.

2556
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,000
Okay, I got it.

2557
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,320
It's going to be... This is right here.

2558
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:02,800
And you just... When you open it in your inventory, you click on it and then you press refill.

2559
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,600
Guys!

2560
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,600
What does he mean by that?

2561
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:17,950
Did it work?

2562
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:21,050
What am I looking at?

2563
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:27,950
Refill!

2564
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:32,670
That's the research...

2565
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,830
I was looking at the research, but I was very confused.

2566
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:38,970
You don't look at it.

2567
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:40,050
You gotta look in your inventory.

2568
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:43,430
Alright, I got it.

2569
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:47,130
I figured it out.

2570
01:39:49,730 --> 01:39:50,130
Nice.

2571
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:51,210
Now we have...

2572
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:53,290
Now we have our gun back.

2573
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:56,590
Alright.

2574
01:40:04,030 --> 01:40:05,630
What the fuck?

2575
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:07,310
I cracked the code.

2576
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:09,750
I cracked it.

2577
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:11,290
I don't like...

2578
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:16,530
Getting out of this area is so scary, because it's all mines everywhere.

2579
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:20,450
We gotta go back to Helm's Deep.

2580
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:22,110
We gotta go back to Helm's Deep?

2581
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:28,590
Alright, I'll see you guys there.

2582
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:34,210
Wait, I'm gonna get my food.

2583
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:38,030
I'm gonna fucking get some food.

2584
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:40,770
Alright.

2585
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:43,730
Grab some food and then...

2586
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:46,390
And then we're gonna head off, guys.

2587
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:50,390
The gun's health is practically non-existent?

2588
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:52,550
How do you see that?

2589
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,650
Guys!

2590
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:57,330
Guys!

2591
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:01,330
I wanna fucking explore a little bit.

2592
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:04,730
Where the fuck is... Why do we have green keycard?

2593
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:06,870
Do we have any food at all?

2594
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:10,370
Click on the gun?

2595
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:12,230
What does it say?

2596
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:14,430
Where do you see it?

2597
01:41:19,110 --> 01:41:21,270
Oh, you're supposed to see a green bar?

2598
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:23,950
Yeah, I don't... I have no idea where that is.

2599
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:26,590
Do we have any food left?

2600
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:31,110
Where's the water?

2601
01:41:32,190 --> 01:41:34,250
Do we have any food left?

2602
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:48,050
I'll grab this.

2603
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:57,370
We need backpacks and everybody needs to transfer stuff because I can't do that by myself.

2604
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:03,150
Holy fuck!

2605
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:05,290
How do we get all... Why do we not get looted?

2606
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:08,250
Alright.

2607
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:09,910
Does anyone have extra food?

2608
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:13,910
Oh,

2609
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:19,070
nice.

2610
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:19,650
Thank you.

2611
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:21,790
Oh, thank you.

2612
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:22,590
I really needed that.

2613
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:24,030
How about extra water, actually?

2614
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:30,970
Alright, we leave.

2615
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:33,910
Thank you for supplying us.

2616
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:34,730
We leave now.

2617
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:43,290
Now we leave.

2618
01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:49,970
It's time to dip.

2619
01:42:55,410 --> 01:42:59,030
Um, I'm... I'm done with... I'm done.

2620
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:01,030
I'm fucking... I'm gonna go to the town.

2621
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:11,080
Alright, let's just hope we can make it... Oh, there's my horse!

2622
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,880
Aren't you that horse that I fuck... Oh, wait!

2623
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,020
That's the horse I left!

2624
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,100
Okay, we gotta be careful with all of my...

2625
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:31,100
With all the mines around us, I'm a little bit...

2626
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:43,420
Let's get our stuff back.

2627
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:49,560
Hey guys, I stepped on a mine.

2628
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,120
Let me get my stuff back.

2629
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:52,960
Wait, why?

2630
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:58,400
Why are you just leaving by yourself?

2631
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:02,280
I saw a horse!

2632
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:07,020
I saw a horse!

2633
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,920
Oh my god.

2634
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:16,080
Wait, don't take my stuff!

2635
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,860
Wait, Lisa, that's my stuff!

2636
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:18,240
Wait!

2637
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,180
Lisa, don't!

2638
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:22,620
That's my stuff!

2639
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:23,400
I saw a horse!

2640
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,560
I saw a horse!

2641
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:34,910
Okay.

2642
01:44:36,190 --> 01:44:38,190
Alright, I'm okay now.

2643
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:41,030
Oh my god.

2644
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:41,950
Okay.

2645
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:45,710
Okay, everything... Okay, that horse is bait.

2646
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:50,230
That horse is bait.

2647
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:57,550
How is the horse alive?

2648
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:00,150
How the fuck?

2649
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:03,590
That horse was actual bait.

2650
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:05,850
That horse was...

2651
01:45:08,130 --> 01:45:11,030
Of course I died to the landmine.

2652
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:11,950
Of course.

2653
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:14,770
Oh my god.

2654
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:18,330
I hate... I hate living here.

2655
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:23,210
I... I hate living here.

2656
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:25,510
It sucks.

2657
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:28,030
There's landmines everywhere.

2658
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:34,120
Alright.

2659
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:38,180
Alright, we're gonna head...

2660
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,960
Who knew horses were blastproof?

2661
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:43,400
Who fucking knew?

2662
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,100
I... I need a map!

2663
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:49,340
I need a map for... Oh wait.

2664
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:51,140
Actually, I really wanna go gambling.

2665
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:53,520
Let's go gambling.

2666
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:57,660
Let's go gambling.

2667
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:01,240
I got a guitar.

2668
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,500
I can just get a guitar?

2669
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,020
Oh my god!

2670
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,740
My luck has changed!

2671
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:14,770
Oh my god!

2672
01:46:15,150 --> 01:46:16,970
My luck has changed!

2673
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:18,090
We found a guitar!

2674
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:24,550
Everything is okay now in the world.

2675
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:27,370
Everything is okay in the world now.

2676
01:46:27,570 --> 01:46:28,470
I'm feel... I'm happy.

2677
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:28,490
I'm happy.

2678
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:35,250
Things are finally looking up for Toki Bird.

2679
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:37,810
Things are finally looking up.

2680
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:42,270
I got a guitar and everything.

2681
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:47,450
But nothing can go wrong now.

2682
01:46:49,630 --> 01:46:50,430
Yippee!

2683
01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:52,810
There's no way there's gonna be mines here.

2684
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:54,770
There's no fucking way.

2685
01:46:56,230 --> 01:46:57,790
I'd be so sad.

2686
01:46:58,910 --> 01:47:02,730
I left the Lurkling's land just to get mine here.

2687
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:04,510
I would be... No, you don't understand.

2688
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:06,370
I would actually be so fucking sad.

2689
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:18,730
I'd actually be so fucking sad if after everything I've been through, they still have mines here.

2690
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:28,130
I'm like, I'm so far away from the Lurkling land that I still... Why did I join the one tribe with no guns?

2691
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:29,790
Like, why did I do that to myself?

2692
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:31,470
I could've had a gun.

2693
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:36,510
I mean, I do have one, but I could've lived with the land of the guns.

2694
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:37,090
You know what?

2695
01:47:38,170 --> 01:47:39,070
Who lives here?

2696
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:43,490
Who's sleeping bag is this?

2697
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:50,910
There's nobody's sleeping bag anymore.

2698
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:55,970
There's nobody's sleeping bag anymore.

2699
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:08,150
No one's sleeping bag.

2700
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:11,490
I'm from the D-Gen Claw.

2701
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:18,550
That's right.

2702
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:20,390
I'm part of D-Gen Claw.

2703
01:48:22,490 --> 01:48:23,450
That's what we do.

2704
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:27,070
That's what we do.

2705
01:48:30,510 --> 01:48:31,730
Stage to attack?

2706
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:33,770
Everyone has to move there?

2707
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:35,530
Alright.

2708
01:48:36,170 --> 01:48:37,250
I wanna go gambling.

2709
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:39,370
I've been through so much.

2710
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,830
At this point, at least let me have gambling.

2711
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:46,850
Alright.

2712
01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:49,270
Oh my god, it's so far.

2713
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:50,710
I wish I had my horse still.

2714
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:54,070
I still have my horses.

2715
01:48:57,650 --> 01:49:00,010
Oh my god, it's so far.

2716
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:03,370
I can't believe it.

2717
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:08,850
If that horse wasn't bait, everything would be okay.

2718
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:12,030
God, the town is so far from everything.

2719
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:14,630
I need more scrap.

2720
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:18,850
I need more scrap for gamble.

2721
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:23,330
I need more scrap for gamble.

2722
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:27,310
Oh my god, another guitar.

2723
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:29,870
Maybe I can sell the guitar too.

2724
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:31,870
More scrap.

2725
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:34,310
More scrap for gamble.

2726
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:36,010
Alright, we should be good.

2727
01:49:36,790 --> 01:49:38,050
That should be enough gambles.

2728
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:40,270
Scrap.

2729
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:41,050
Spikes.

2730
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:45,630
Oh my god, two guitars?!

2731
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:53,350
I swear, every time I come back, something...

2732
01:49:53,950 --> 01:50:00,270
I swear, I feel like I come back and it's like the season finale of season 6.

2733
01:50:03,550 --> 01:50:05,330
I'm like, what happened?

2734
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:11,290
What happened?

2735
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:15,950
Okay, where am I?

2736
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:17,350
Okay, it's this way.

2737
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:19,850
God, this is so difficult to navigate.

2738
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:20,810
Okay, it's this way.

2739
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:23,010
Oh, we don't want to go through the military tunnel.

2740
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:25,010
No, we don't want to go through the military.

2741
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:28,870
I only come... and then tomorrow, there's a big event too.

2742
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:32,410
I mean, I guess tomorrow is the last day of rest.

2743
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:33,910
I'll stream tomorrow as well.

2744
01:50:34,430 --> 01:50:37,390
I don't know how... does anyone know what time it ends?

2745
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:38,810
Like rest tomorrow?

2746
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:42,470
At least I can see my gun for like fucking one minute.

2747
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:49,030
I literally saw my AK skin for one minute.

2748
01:50:52,970 --> 01:51:00,810
And then it's back to the lurking hours.

2749
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:05,810
That's fine.

2750
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:07,910
I'm gonna gamble a little.

2751
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:10,950
Why didn't you just keep it?

2752
01:51:11,410 --> 01:51:11,990
I know.

2753
01:51:12,330 --> 01:51:15,150
Why was I trying to be nice?

2754
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:20,450
Being nice never works for me.

2755
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:26,870
Gamble the sorrow away.

2756
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:32,430
You know like on Netflix, it's like...

2757
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:33,310
Here's what you missed.

2758
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:33,990
That's me.

2759
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:37,790
Here's what you missed.

2760
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:40,510
Alright, anyway.

2761
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:42,350
So, what the fuck?

2762
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:46,650
Bruins, tissues, BoxBox, J-Mobile, Nike.

2763
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:48,130
Oh, there's the Nike club!

2764
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:49,430
The Zeus Caboose.

2765
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:51,970
There's so many new shops now.

2766
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:54,770
I think the meat shop is like...

2767
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:57,690
I'm pretty sure the meat shop is like people.

2768
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:00,070
I'm pretty sure.

2769
01:52:00,610 --> 01:52:01,890
It's always people.

2770
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:02,730
That's the thing.

2771
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:04,470
There's no way.

2772
01:52:04,610 --> 01:52:06,570
Does the biker gang still exist?

2773
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:10,830
There's no way that the biker gang still exists.

2774
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:12,550
I refuse to believe.

2775
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:13,490
Oh, there's a rope.

2776
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:17,670
What's this?

2777
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:19,670
Does anybody live here?

2778
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:23,610
Whoa.

2779
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:28,040
Who lives here?

2780
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:30,660
Why are there so many cards?

2781
01:52:36,110 --> 01:52:37,730
Oh, I could break that right now.

2782
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:40,210
Who lives here?

2783
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:46,350
Wait, I need to wear other clothes.

2784
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:48,630
So they don't think I'm a lurkling.

2785
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:53,910
I need to have like other clothes on.

2786
01:52:54,610 --> 01:52:55,170
Okay.

2787
01:52:55,710 --> 01:52:56,730
I need to be like...

2788
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,870
Unlurkling.

2789
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:01,490
Okay, wait.

2790
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:04,850
There we go.

2791
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:07,730
Now they won't know.

2792
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,040
It's only one hit.

2793
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:32,260
Now they won't know.

2794
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:33,820
Now they won't know.

2795
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,260
They won't know I'm a lurkling.

2796
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,820
I'm just a regular guy.

2797
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:40,180
I'm just...

2798
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:42,200
I'm just a regular guy.

2799
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:44,780
Just trying to make it in this world, you know?

2800
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:45,820
I'm just...

2801
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,740
I'm just trying to figure out what...

2802
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,240
I have no allegiance.

2803
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,920
Just a dude, you know?

2804
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:53,960
Just a dude.

2805
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:57,680
Can't...

2806
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:01,930
Can't get chased if I'm not part of the lurklings.

2807
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:03,740
And they don't know.

2808
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:07,820
Just a guy.

2809
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:09,880
Just a regular guy.

2810
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,300
Are they still gambling?

2811
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,820
There is a war and they're gambling.

2812
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,680
What the fuck are they doing?

2813
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:25,780
They're gambling, aren't they?

2814
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:34,010
Oh, they're fucking gambling.

2815
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:37,870
Oh, I'm not gonna call him out because I'm joining them.

2816
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:41,430
He is.

2817
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:42,530
He's gambling too.

2818
01:54:44,770 --> 01:54:47,350
Oh yeah, we're making money for the lurklings.

2819
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:49,370
Yeah, how much money did you guys make?

2820
01:54:52,210 --> 01:54:54,410
Oh, I don't really like that question.

2821
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:59,450
You should be asking how much money are we gonna make.

2822
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:01,050
Oh yeah, how much money are you guys gonna make?

2823
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:03,890
A billion!

2824
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:07,950
There's no fucking way I've lost 3,000 scrap in three turns.

2825
01:55:08,130 --> 01:55:09,750
There's just no way.

2826
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:11,590
Wait, how much did you lose?

2827
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:16,030
3,500 scrap in three turns.

2828
01:55:18,710 --> 01:55:22,390
I'm putting 150 on 20 and if this doesn't hit, then I have nothing.

2829
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:31,610
Wouldn't it be funny if you lose everything, LM?

2830
01:55:33,390 --> 01:55:35,310
What would you do if you lost everything?

2831
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:40,590
That would be funny because he took a loan out in my name and I need to pay it back.

2832
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:42,610
Wait, who did you take a loan from?

2833
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:43,730
Who?

2834
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:44,150
Which?

2835
01:55:44,350 --> 01:55:45,690
Who did you take a loan from?

2836
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:47,230
Who?

2837
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:50,650
Bruce the loan shark?

2838
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:56,410
There is a loan shark?

2839
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,810
What does he do?

2840
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:03,690
What does he do if you don't pay him back?

2841
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:07,170
Who will he do to you?

2842
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:12,570
Guys, I don't think it's gonna be red.

2843
01:56:13,150 --> 01:56:14,150
I don't...

2844
01:56:19,810 --> 01:56:23,370
LM, I'm one...

2845
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:26,590
Listen, I'm one ketchup away, okay?

2846
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:29,990
From making like 2,000 scrap and then we're back.

2847
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:32,230
Are you like...

2848
01:56:32,230 --> 01:56:33,270
I keep betting 100.

2849
01:56:35,050 --> 01:56:37,370
Wait, wait, so...

2850
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:45,490
So, like, basically, you need to win one red and then you'll be back to positive or back to zero?

2851
01:56:49,950 --> 01:56:50,950
Oh, okay.

2852
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:52,770
You know, I'm...

2853
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:56,110
So what does Bruce do when you don't pay back the loans?

2854
01:56:56,230 --> 01:56:57,210
Like, what does he do?

2855
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:02,290
Oh, okay.

2856
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:04,590
And where did you get this loan?

2857
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:06,410
Like, where did you meet Bruce?

2858
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:10,690
He's a little bit down the road from here.

2859
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:11,510
Okay.

2860
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:12,810
Yeah!

2861
01:57:14,650 --> 01:57:16,350
Yeah, I wanna see Bruce.

2862
01:57:22,330 --> 01:57:26,170
You know, I think all three of us should see Bruce right now.

2863
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:26,550
I think...

2864
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:30,930
I mean, LM, don't you need more scrap?

2865
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:34,930
I'm gonna keep working it.

2866
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:40,990
You go and then with... Okay, you go, Dougie, and then I'll keep... I'm gonna make money.

2867
01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:41,810
I don't wanna miss the red.

2868
01:57:41,810 --> 01:57:42,310
You keep winning.

2869
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:42,750
You keep winning.

2870
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:45,090
Why is there so many pigs here?

2871
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:48,930
Oh, my God.

2872
01:57:48,990 --> 01:57:51,510
I don't know, but because of the friendly zone, they won't attack you.

2873
01:57:51,790 --> 01:57:52,730
Oh, okay, okay.

2874
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:53,790
I was like, what the fuck?

2875
01:57:54,590 --> 01:57:56,050
So, like, how much...

2876
01:57:57,690 --> 01:57:59,430
How much did you...

2877
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:02,430
Borrow from this loan shark, LM?

2878
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:11,870
And how much did Foolish borrow?

2879
01:58:16,030 --> 01:58:17,550
How much did...

2880
01:58:18,110 --> 01:58:19,250
That's not Bruce.

2881
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:26,430
Loan subject to 50% interest day one and 50...

2882
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:31,810
Well, no, I'm curious.

2883
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:32,750
No, I'm curious.

2884
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:33,350
I'm curious.

2885
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:35,890
What happens if you don't pay back the loan?

2886
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:45,300
Like...

2887
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:51,020
Yeah, he lost everything, by the way, so I don't think he's paying it back.

2888
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,000
Like, what happens to him?

2889
01:59:00,650 --> 01:59:01,570
You think he'll be...

2890
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:09,950
So it says, like, 50% interest day one plus 50% each day after.

2891
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:13,030
So...

2892
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:16,890
So, like, how much scrap can I legally borrow?

2893
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:25,570
Oh, and what do you mean by that?

2894
01:59:26,810 --> 01:59:28,270
Heads to collect?

2895
01:59:28,770 --> 01:59:29,330
Oh.

2896
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:35,330
Oh.

2897
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:40,450
What do you mean by collateral?

2898
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:49,230
Oh, I see.

2899
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:51,690
I see.

2900
01:59:52,630 --> 01:59:54,590
Okay, so...

2901
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:07,310
How much are you looking to borrow?

2902
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:09,010
I mean...

2903
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:11,190
I mean, if I leave, like...

2904
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:12,310
I don't know.

2905
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:14,090
I don't really have much on me right now.

2906
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:16,630
All my other stuff is back home.

2907
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:18,450
Yeah.

2908
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:25,300
How much would that... How much would that get me?

2909
02:00:33,450 --> 02:00:33,850
Hey.

2910
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:35,910
Yeah, you like that?

2911
02:00:38,830 --> 02:00:40,250
Ours doesn't look like that.

2912
02:00:41,430 --> 02:00:41,730
Yeah.

2913
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:43,910
I got it off a dead body.

2914
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:47,990
I got it off a DJN claw.

2915
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:05,840
2,000?

2916
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:07,120
Just 2,000?

2917
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:12,300
Didn't LM get, like, 3...

2918
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:13,820
That's all you got left?

2919
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,300
LM got, like...

2920
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:19,720
LM got, like, 3...

2921
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:21,720
I think this is...

2922
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:28,900
Okay, but this is, like, a real... This has, like, lots of kills on it.

2923
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,600
I've killed, like, a lot of people with this.

2924
02:01:45,230 --> 02:01:45,870
Haha.

2925
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:55,850
Wait, mine's about to...

2926
02:01:57,650 --> 02:02:00,110
Wait, this minigun's about to break, right?

2927
02:02:00,670 --> 02:02:01,090
Guys?

2928
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:06,290
Oh, okay.

2929
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:06,970
You know what?

2930
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,330
Okay.

2931
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:08,790
Alright.

2932
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:09,790
You know what?

2933
02:02:09,910 --> 02:02:10,170
Alright.

2934
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:11,970
I'm...

2935
02:02:11,970 --> 02:02:14,270
I guess... I guess...

2936
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:16,010
You know, I can make it back easily.

2937
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:19,110
It's, like, holding it for, like, 10 seconds, right?

2938
02:02:26,890 --> 02:02:27,290
Yeah.

2939
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:28,890
Yeah, that'd be fine.

2940
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:30,010
Alright.

2941
02:02:35,610 --> 02:02:36,790
I thought it was a 2K.

2942
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:38,230
I thought I could get 2K.

2943
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:38,930
Hey, Foolish.

2944
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:41,590
Wait, did you lose all your money, Foolish?

2945
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:46,770
Wait,

2946
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:55,790
I thought you said you only have 2K left.

2947
02:02:58,050 --> 02:02:59,590
He only has 2K left.

2948
02:03:00,250 --> 02:03:00,490
Yeah.

2949
02:03:04,470 --> 02:03:07,810
Foolish, how much... Do you need the scrap more than me, Foolish?

2950
02:03:08,830 --> 02:03:11,090
Uh, no.

2951
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:12,030
I don't need scrap.

2952
02:03:12,130 --> 02:03:13,670
I'm about to make so much scrap back.

2953
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:21,840
That's the thing.

2954
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:27,040
Oh.

2955
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:29,980
Oh, I see.

2956
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:33,640
Is it possible to split it up 1K and 1K?

2957
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:36,880
No, I rather... It's 2K or nothing for me.

2958
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:39,160
Oh.

2959
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:40,040
Oh, wow.

2960
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:45,240
Yeah.

2961
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:47,160
Does that sound great?

2962
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:49,180
Yeah.

2963
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:52,860
Alright.

2964
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:04,780
Alright, good trade.

2965
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:06,200
Good trade.

2966
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:07,000
Yeah, great business.

2967
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:08,160
Alright, Foolish.

2968
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,360
How badly do you want this 1K?

2969
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:15,520
Yeah.

2970
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:17,400
Yeah, what's that gun you have there?

2971
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:21,950
An M39 rifle.

2972
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:24,930
Yeah, how much... How many bullets are in there?

2973
02:04:25,350 --> 02:04:26,210
Do you have an AK?

2974
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:29,650
Uh, there's 7... There's... Uh, no.

2975
02:04:29,690 --> 02:04:30,390
I don't have an AK.

2976
02:04:30,670 --> 02:04:32,810
Oh, I guess we can't do any business with you then.

2977
02:04:34,190 --> 02:04:35,850
Oh, you want an AK or nothing.

2978
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:37,410
Yeah, it's either AK or nothing.

2979
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:40,530
Oh, yeah.

2980
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:42,030
Hey, maybe they have an AK.

2981
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:43,550
Time to go hit some crates.

2982
02:04:44,030 --> 02:04:45,270
Maybe they have AKs.

2983
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:46,370
What, I'm gonna go to them and...

2984
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:47,910
Yeah, ask if they have AKs.

2985
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:48,950
Wait, I have an idea.

2986
02:04:50,090 --> 02:04:52,330
Can I make a loan on an AK?

2987
02:04:59,150 --> 02:05:01,430
Oh, you got a pretty big debt.

2988
02:05:02,790 --> 02:05:03,670
Wait, whoa, whoa.

2989
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:04,770
You can literally ask Brutho.

2990
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:06,070
I literally paid back my debt.

2991
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:09,070
Yeah.

2992
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:12,970
Are you gonna pay that one back?

2993
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:15,550
Uh, yeah.

2994
02:05:15,730 --> 02:05:16,310
Yeah, yeah.

2995
02:05:17,650 --> 02:05:21,490
Uh, let me see.

2996
02:05:21,630 --> 02:05:23,230
Whoa, what the heck?

2997
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:27,250
Yeah, foolish.

2998
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:28,730
Is that your name over there?

2999
02:05:28,870 --> 02:05:30,610
The 4,500?

3000
02:05:32,970 --> 02:05:35,810
How do some people have over 10,000?

3001
02:05:38,230 --> 02:05:41,530
Uh, they just let the interest accrue and forgot to pay.

3002
02:05:43,890 --> 02:05:45,550
Oh, you know what?

3003
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:48,510
I have a better idea.

3004
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:52,610
I am just gonna go hit the road and get some scrap.

3005
02:05:54,210 --> 02:05:54,610
Alright.

3006
02:05:56,330 --> 02:05:57,690
You wanna borrow an SMG?

3007
02:05:57,770 --> 02:05:59,950
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

3008
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:00,710
It's all good.

3009
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:02,790
You know what?

3010
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:03,390
Don't worry about it.

3011
02:06:03,410 --> 02:06:05,610
I appreciate your business and I'm gonna make some money back.

3012
02:06:06,710 --> 02:06:07,990
Alright, we'll see you soon.

3013
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:09,190
Alright.

3014
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:13,430
Alright.

3015
02:06:14,110 --> 02:06:15,190
Great service.

3016
02:06:15,630 --> 02:06:17,250
That's actually crazy.

3017
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:19,570
There's loan sharks here now.

3018
02:06:22,730 --> 02:06:24,370
You're making it.

3019
02:06:24,470 --> 02:06:25,410
You're almost there.

3020
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:35,630
Oh, this is a nightclub.

3021
02:06:39,130 --> 02:06:41,430
This restaurant has everything.

3022
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:43,550
Does anyone have AKs?

3023
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:45,750
I wanna trade.

3024
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:50,990
I wanna trade for an AK.

3025
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:54,490
Come try your luck?

3026
02:06:54,610 --> 02:06:55,630
Wait, what's the maze?

3027
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:56,570
U17?

3028
02:06:57,530 --> 02:06:58,350
Where's that?

3029
02:06:58,490 --> 02:06:59,610
I wanna go to the maze.

3030
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:04,090
Wait, maybe there's shops.

3031
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:04,670
You're right.

3032
02:07:06,490 --> 02:07:07,890
A shop.

3033
02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:11,470
Tissue box, J-mobile, vending machines.

3034
02:07:11,990 --> 02:07:15,510
There's like vending machines, but like is there any actual?

3035
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:18,490
Donations are accepted.

3036
02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:22,110
Frauds, stealing, exposed.

3037
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:24,610
What the fuck is going on?

3038
02:07:25,730 --> 02:07:27,650
Boeing Co's casino?

3039
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:34,710
We have a casino?

3040
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,710
Oh my god, wait!

3041
02:07:41,630 --> 02:07:43,070
Press the drop bar.

3042
02:07:43,650 --> 02:07:45,190
50 scrap per...

3043
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:51,930
Wait, is this the cas- Oh my god, wait, how do I drop the scrap?

3044
02:07:53,810 --> 02:07:55,990
Oh, okay, I'm gonna take this.

3045
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:01,550
How do I?

3046
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:08,370
Oh, did I just put 50 in here?

3047
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:13,490
How do I separate this?

3048
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:16,150
Oh, there we go.

3049
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,120
No, that's not how I- Fuck, I don't know how to do this.

3050
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:26,500
Oh, there we go.

3051
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:28,480
25.

3052
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,480
Wait, where's my other scrap?

3053
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:34,560
Why is it just 25?

3054
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:37,160
Wait a minute, what happened to my others?

3055
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:39,580
Oh, there it is.

3056
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:40,000
Okay.

3057
02:08:45,230 --> 02:08:46,470
Oh.

3058
02:08:47,030 --> 02:08:47,730
Oh!

3059
02:08:52,890 --> 02:08:53,590
Hey!

3060
02:08:54,630 --> 02:08:55,870
It's working!

3061
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:01,750
748, 489.

3062
02:09:04,110 --> 02:09:04,810
50.

3063
02:09:08,510 --> 02:09:09,330
Wait!

3064
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:13,960
Wait, I can make it back!

3065
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,760
Oh, wait.

3066
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:20,160
Hello?

3067
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,040
Yeah?

3068
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:22,560
Gumi?

3069
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:24,960
Hey!

3070
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:28,360
Did you know there's a gambling- There's a casino here?

3071
02:09:32,530 --> 02:09:33,290
I'm gambling.

3072
02:09:40,290 --> 02:09:41,590
I'm gambling.

3073
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:46,050
Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

3074
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:50,030
I keep getting 0.3.

3075
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:55,700
Gumi, I took a loan from the loan shark.

3076
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:57,620
Is that bad?

3077
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:05,480
What do they do if I- What do they do if I- If I don't pay it back?

3078
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:06,980
They didn't specify.

3079
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:15,490
Oh, I lost it all!

3080
02:10:20,650 --> 02:10:22,090
What do they do?

3081
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:25,110
Like, do I get to live?

3082
02:10:29,130 --> 02:10:31,130
Why did you do the dragon game?

3083
02:10:32,150 --> 02:10:33,290
The dragon game?

3084
02:10:33,570 --> 02:10:34,390
What's that?

3085
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:41,300
What's that?

3086
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:45,020
Guys, I think this casino's rigged.

3087
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:48,600
I think this casino's rigged.

3088
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:50,620
Wait, I heard there's a maze.

3089
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:52,280
I heard there's a maze.

3090
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:57,120
It's like you something?

3091
02:10:57,540 --> 02:10:58,480
Guys, where's the maze?

3092
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:02,100
I wanna do the maze, Gumi!

3093
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:03,820
Steal a car.

3094
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:06,440
Steal?

3095
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,840
That's illegal.

3096
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:11,040
Borrow a car.

3097
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:12,560
Let's borrow a car from someone.

3098
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:16,440
I don't know what they're roleplaying back there, but I hope it's fun.

3099
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:21,320
I hope they have a good time.

3100
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:22,400
We can steal this horse.

3101
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:26,320
That was my horse, man.

3102
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,400
Anyway, U7.

3103
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:31,400
Where's U7?

3104
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:33,520
Where's U7?

3105
02:11:37,830 --> 02:11:38,310
Wait.

3106
02:11:38,850 --> 02:11:39,730
Wait, you...

3107
02:11:41,170 --> 02:11:42,670
Hey, Foolish, did you grab your scrap?

3108
02:11:42,770 --> 02:11:43,790
Oh, goodbye, Foolish.

3109
02:11:46,830 --> 02:11:47,310
U7?

3110
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:48,630
U7's the maze.

3111
02:11:52,570 --> 02:11:53,490
You hear that?

3112
02:11:56,630 --> 02:11:58,510
Oh my god, there's an art gallery!

3113
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:06,810
Ted!

3114
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:11,530
Ted!

3115
02:12:12,350 --> 02:12:13,510
I heard...

3116
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:16,290
I heard you... I...

3117
02:12:16,290 --> 02:12:20,730
I got... Yes, I woke up from my coma, Ted.

3118
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:25,430
I heard you're a fucking spy.

3119
02:12:28,290 --> 02:12:31,110
I heard from Tekken!

3120
02:12:31,490 --> 02:12:34,290
That you're actually a spy!

3121
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:40,090
Woah, that was old of me.

3122
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:41,250
That was old of me.

3123
02:12:41,650 --> 02:12:42,010
Yeah!

3124
02:12:42,550 --> 02:12:43,930
Look at me now.

3125
02:12:45,010 --> 02:12:46,870
Don't look more happy like that.

3126
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:49,790
What is new you?

3127
02:12:49,970 --> 02:12:51,510
What is new you anyway?

3128
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:52,130
Oh!

3129
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:55,810
Oh, what the...

3130
02:12:57,630 --> 02:12:58,270
Woah!

3131
02:12:59,390 --> 02:13:01,410
Clearly, you're still the same you, Ted.

3132
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:01,910
Oh!

3133
02:13:05,870 --> 02:13:08,030
Clearly, that's the same you.

3134
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:08,690
Oh!

3135
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:14,250
You've never changed, Ted.

3136
02:13:14,490 --> 02:13:16,570
I knew you were trouble.

3137
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:19,670
I knew you were trouble.

3138
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:25,430
I knew you were trouble the moment I woke up from that coma four days ago.

3139
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:26,670
I knew it.

3140
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:31,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3141
02:13:31,650 --> 02:13:34,070
Okay, let me go back to drawing.

3142
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:37,010
Is that your art therapy now?

3143
02:13:37,130 --> 02:13:38,130
Look, look at this.

3144
02:13:38,710 --> 02:13:39,410
No, no, no, look.

3145
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:40,570
What's this?

3146
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:42,010
Isn't this insane?

3147
02:13:42,130 --> 02:13:42,610
This one?

3148
02:13:43,290 --> 02:13:44,450
What the fuck?

3149
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:45,370
That's crazy.

3150
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:46,530
What the fuck?

3151
02:13:46,590 --> 02:13:47,290
Oh my god, this...

3152
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:49,170
This one's insane.

3153
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:53,890
Woah, my god.

3154
02:13:54,030 --> 02:13:55,130
What do you think about this one?

3155
02:13:55,450 --> 02:13:56,290
What do you think about these two?

3156
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:57,870
Which one?

3157
02:13:58,130 --> 02:13:58,230
This?

3158
02:13:58,650 --> 02:13:59,690
This one and this one.

3159
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:02,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3160
02:14:02,150 --> 02:14:05,330
See, this is my first ever drawing and this is my second ever drawing.

3161
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:07,590
Wait, so you became an artist after betraying everybody?

3162
02:14:09,710 --> 02:14:11,770
Wait, how did someone die?

3163
02:14:12,150 --> 02:14:17,450
So, you became an artist after millions of people died, Ted.

3164
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:19,810
You just became an artist.

3165
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,790
What do you...

3166
02:14:21,790 --> 02:14:23,010
Okay, just shut up.

3167
02:14:23,230 --> 02:14:24,030
What do you think about it?

3168
02:14:24,150 --> 02:14:24,770
What do you think about it?

3169
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:27,070
It's very backwards of you.

3170
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:40,700
Oh my god.

3171
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:47,170
Oh my god.

3172
02:14:47,470 --> 02:14:47,870
These are...

3173
02:14:49,570 --> 02:14:51,510
Oh my god, look at this cat.

3174
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:52,890
Oh my god, woah.

3175
02:14:53,410 --> 02:14:56,110
Okay, that cat... that cat is really good.

3176
02:14:57,510 --> 02:14:59,850
That cat is a really good artist.

3177
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:01,890
Da Vinci?

3178
02:15:02,270 --> 02:15:04,830
Oh my god, they're all cat drawings by...

3179
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:07,130
Look at all these cat drawings.

3180
02:15:16,530 --> 02:15:17,950
Oh my god.

3181
02:15:18,130 --> 02:15:19,470
Wait, that's actually so pretty.

3182
02:15:20,010 --> 02:15:22,930
For like, on... on piece, like, for Rust.

3183
02:15:24,770 --> 02:15:27,290
Oh my god, it's Serial Ghibli.

3184
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:28,350
Kiki's Delivery.

3185
02:15:28,390 --> 02:15:29,550
Have you tried drawing in Rust yet, Doki?

3186
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:31,410
No, I've never tried drawing in Rust.

3187
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:33,390
Stay wobbling.

3188
02:15:34,330 --> 02:15:36,110
You should draw, you should draw.

3189
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:39,890
It's really hard, man.

3190
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:40,430
Everything changes you.

3191
02:15:41,650 --> 02:15:44,210
I know, I know, I know it changed you, Ted.

3192
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:46,170
It is.

3193
02:15:46,730 --> 02:15:48,090
Oh my god!

3194
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:52,920
That's so pretty, Chad.

3195
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:57,740
Oh my god, people are so talented here in the server.

3196
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:01,700
Wait, people are insanely talented in this server.

3197
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:03,380
That's actually crazy.

3198
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:06,240
Is this drawn in Rust too?

3199
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:07,580
Are they allotting?

3200
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,080
Aren't all of them drawn in Rust?

3201
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:10,120
Everything in this gallery?

3202
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:11,680
Yes.

3203
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:14,420
Everything in this gallery is drawn in Rust.

3204
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:15,800
That's crazy.

3205
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:17,440
Holy shit.

3206
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:20,280
Oh my god, this looks amazing.

3207
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:21,040
Doki, look at the eyeball.

3208
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:21,800
Yes.

3209
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:22,980
Which one?

3210
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:23,840
Whoa!

3211
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:26,460
Wait, that looks amazing.

3212
02:16:27,380 --> 02:16:28,960
Did you draw that, Monstera?

3213
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:33,280
This one is by DaVinci.

3214
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:38,340
And then we have more artists like Bee behind you.

3215
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:41,700
These are my paintings up here.

3216
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:42,900
Oh, it looks so good!

3217
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:52,180
We have Kale, Wreck-It-Rabbit, and Joji.

3218
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:55,760
That's an ad right there.

3219
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,440
Oh my god, it's really cute.

3220
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:01,760
It's really pretty.

3221
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:07,900
Alright, Kumi, I'm ready to go to the maze.

3222
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:15,490
Wait, what's wrong with the maze?

3223
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:19,150
I'll see you in an hour, Doki.

3224
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:20,470
See you in an hour.

3225
02:17:20,550 --> 02:17:21,210
It's super fun.

3226
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:22,630
Doki, there's two horses!

3227
02:17:22,910 --> 02:17:23,790
There's two horses?

3228
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:24,830
Alright, let's go.

3229
02:17:27,050 --> 02:17:28,150
Where's the other horse?

3230
02:17:30,870 --> 02:17:33,290
I fucking knew Ted was bad news.

3231
02:17:33,770 --> 02:17:37,110
I can't believe after everything he did, he went on and became an artist.

3232
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:39,250
Alright.

3233
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:42,690
Wait, do you have the coordinates for the maze?

3234
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:45,230
It's like U something.

3235
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:46,270
U7?

3236
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:48,630
U18.

3237
02:17:49,150 --> 02:17:49,710
U18?

3238
02:17:50,130 --> 02:17:50,830
For the maze?

3239
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:52,250
Hello, Kumi.

3240
02:17:53,090 --> 02:17:54,210
Kumi, take these.

3241
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:56,250
Wait, why is your name red?

3242
02:17:56,310 --> 02:17:57,210
Who did you kill?

3243
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:03,430
Just in case you get stuck in the maze.

3244
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:08,900
You're 16, right?

3245
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:11,100
If you get stuck in the maze, you can chop your way out.

3246
02:18:12,560 --> 02:18:13,360
You're 16?

3247
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:15,480
Yeah, you're 16 on the river.

3248
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:15,940
Alright.

3249
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:17,940
Alright, Kumi, I follow you.

3250
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:20,400
There's a fashion store?

3251
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,320
Stop being ugly!

3252
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:23,420
Oh my god.

3253
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:25,900
What the fuck is this store?

3254
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3255
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:28,400
Kumi, Kumi, Kumi, wait.

3256
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:32,620
Wait, there's some stores here that's like I had to do a double take.

3257
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:35,660
Hot zilfs.

3258
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:38,380
Fashion and a boyfriend.

3259
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:40,780
Not guaranteed a heart.

3260
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:43,460
Stop being lonely.

3261
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:46,700
What the fuck?

3262
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:48,540
The fuck is a zilf?

3263
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:51,380
Kumi, are you Kumi?

3264
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:51,960
Kumi, no.

3265
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:52,900
Kumi, it's a lie.

3266
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:54,920
Kumi, no, it's a lie!

3267
02:19:00,530 --> 02:19:00,730
What?

3268
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:04,390
Why was there an OOC?

3269
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:10,140
What is that?

3270
02:19:15,950 --> 02:19:16,490
Wait.

3271
02:19:17,470 --> 02:19:18,970
What do you do with them?

3272
02:19:21,370 --> 02:19:22,730
What do you do with them?

3273
02:19:22,730 --> 02:19:24,730
Zombie, I...

3274
02:19:25,310 --> 02:19:27,570
Zombie, I love father.

3275
02:19:28,330 --> 02:19:30,950
Yeah, but like, what do you do with zombies?

3276
02:19:32,610 --> 02:19:34,190
Man, I love fishing.

3277
02:19:35,070 --> 02:19:36,650
Man, I love fishing.

3278
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:38,710
Zombs, I love fishing.

3279
02:19:40,410 --> 02:19:41,910
Zombs, I love fishing.

3280
02:19:50,850 --> 02:19:52,610
Zoinks, I love fishing.

3281
02:19:53,850 --> 02:19:55,750
But what do you do with zombies?

3282
02:19:57,010 --> 02:19:59,800
What do you do with...

3283
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:01,810
What the fuck is...

3284
02:20:01,810 --> 02:20:03,310
Oh my god, there's fighting!

3285
02:20:03,630 --> 02:20:05,370
There's fighting within the server!

3286
02:20:11,470 --> 02:20:12,790
Fucking Joey.

3287
02:20:21,250 --> 02:20:22,610
Wait, so like...

3288
02:20:23,370 --> 02:20:25,410
But like, what do you do with zombies?

3289
02:20:30,030 --> 02:20:30,550
Anyway...

3290
02:20:30,550 --> 02:20:31,350
I guess...

3291
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:33,270
Alright, Kumi, I...

3292
02:20:34,470 --> 02:20:35,790
Kumi, I have...

3293
02:20:35,790 --> 02:20:39,290
I have 30 minutes left and then I have to go get dinner.

3294
02:20:39,550 --> 02:20:39,930
Because...

3295
02:20:39,930 --> 02:20:41,350
Because I need...

3296
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:42,090
I haven't had...

3297
02:20:42,090 --> 02:20:43,430
I haven't had dinner yet.

3298
02:20:46,330 --> 02:20:49,090
Our last ride is into the maze.

3299
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:51,530
You see it?

3300
02:20:51,550 --> 02:20:52,130
Where is it?

3301
02:20:56,220 --> 02:20:57,080
What is that?

3302
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,260
Is that the maze?

3303
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:05,240
Hello?

3304
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:08,720
Is this the maze?

3305
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:14,300
Yeah, do you want to try it?

3306
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:15,380
Yeah!

3307
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:18,620
I can let you in and start a timer.

3308
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:21,540
Do you want to do it solo or do you want to go together?

3309
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:22,220
Together!

3310
02:21:25,580 --> 02:21:26,040
Alright.

3311
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:29,240
Make sure you have enough food, enough water.

3312
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:30,900
You can drink in the river if you need.

3313
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:36,040
Let me go check if there's any pumpkin plugs.

3314
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:38,200
I ran out of pumpkin.

3315
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:40,820
You know what to do!

3316
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:42,140
Kumi, we touch...

3317
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:42,440
We...

3318
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:43,560
We touch right!

3319
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:47,780
Hug right!

3320
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:48,620
Hug right!

3321
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:54,120
If you think it's gonna be that easy, I can let you in right now.

3322
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:56,980
Wait...

3323
02:21:56,980 --> 02:21:58,400
Wait, okay, so like...

3324
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:01,280
I'm gonna kill myself...

3325
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:03,580
How long has this person been trapped in the maze?

3326
02:22:03,580 --> 02:22:06,340
I'm gonna shoot myself...

3327
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:07,980
How long has that person been trapped in the maze?

3328
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:11,040
There's some people that took 5 minutes, 8 minutes.

3329
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:13,800
And there's some people that took over an hour.

3330
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,800
You think that...

3331
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:19,100
Is that lady the ones that have been in the maze for an hour?

3332
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:21,060
Is she...

3333
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:24,060
It's the second time in the maze and she's still in there.

3334
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:26,380
She had to leave earlier for the wedding.

3335
02:22:27,620 --> 02:22:29,940
Because it took almost an hour.

3336
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:31,320
Oh...

3337
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:33,320
Okay...

3338
02:22:33,320 --> 02:22:35,780
Sometimes it takes longer, sometimes it's shorter.

3339
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:36,660
Hi guys!

3340
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:37,980
Alright, you know what?

3341
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:38,680
You guys wanna try the maze?

3342
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:39,900
Yeah, we wanna try the maze!

3343
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,840
We got this!

3344
02:22:41,020 --> 02:22:41,300
Okay.

3345
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:44,220
Okay, just so you guys are aware...

3346
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:46,280
I know you guys are really good friends with us, like you know...

3347
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:46,840
This is his time.

3348
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:47,840
It's really funny.

3349
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:51,020
Yeah, we can beat it.

3350
02:22:51,220 --> 02:22:52,320
Yeah, we can beat it.

3351
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:53,120
That's so easy.

3352
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:54,060
Just so you guys are aware...

3353
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,000
Yeah?

3354
02:22:57,140 --> 02:22:58,340
Just so you guys are aware...

3355
02:22:58,340 --> 02:23:01,260
Loads of people have been stuck for over an hour and can't escape.

3356
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:03,160
So, are you two prepared mentally?

3357
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:04,180
You should go separate, guys.

3358
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:06,020
It's so funny talking to each other.

3359
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:07,520
I can always save you, I just ran the maze again.

3360
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:09,040
I know it now.

3361
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:10,400
Nah, it's fine.

3362
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:11,460
We should be okay.

3363
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:12,060
Sure.

3364
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:15,080
Take some food, take some food, take some food.

3365
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:15,820
Where's more food?

3366
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:18,260
Okay, okay.

3367
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:18,880
Can...

3368
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,120
I need more food then.

3369
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:20,860
Thank you.

3370
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:22,860
Alright.

3371
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:26,620
We got this.

3372
02:23:26,620 --> 02:23:28,020
Let's go.

3373
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:28,720
Okay.

3374
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:29,740
Go, go, go, go, go.

3375
02:23:29,820 --> 02:23:31,060
I'm starting a timer, guys.

3376
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:32,500
Can't be that bad.

3377
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:34,860
Go this way.

3378
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:40,900
We don't go that way.

3379
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:42,200
Thank you.

3380
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:46,080
You said hug right.

3381
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:47,780
Hug right, hug right.

3382
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,920
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

3383
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:50,580
Hug right.

3384
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:52,460
Who's telling you to hug right?

3385
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:52,800
Hug right.

3386
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:53,580
They might be wrong.

3387
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:56,260
Wait, why are you trying to say...

3388
02:23:56,260 --> 02:23:57,360
I don't know why.

3389
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:00,760
Are you trying to say that we're wrong?

3390
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:05,700
No, I'm trying to say whoever's telling you...

3391
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:09,220
Whoever came up with the idea to hug right in a maze like this is wrong.

3392
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:10,680
How would you know?

3393
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:11,980
Have you ever hugged right?

3394
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:15,460
Yeah, I built this.

3395
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:16,740
You built it?

3396
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:17,740
Wait, why are you following?

3397
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:18,860
Are you following us?

3398
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:20,100
Why are you following us?

3399
02:24:21,940 --> 02:24:22,700
It's funny.

3400
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:25,400
It's funny seeing how far people can or can't get right.

3401
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,480
Doki, I want you to lead.

3402
02:24:28,580 --> 02:24:29,260
I don't have a lightbulb.

3403
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:33,320
Guys, I don't...

3404
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:35,520
I don't think we should hug right anymore.

3405
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:39,740
I don't think we should hug right anymore.

3406
02:24:43,910 --> 02:24:45,170
I'm rubberbanding a little.

3407
02:24:45,290 --> 02:24:46,210
I don't know why.

3408
02:24:48,050 --> 02:24:48,830
What is...

3409
02:24:48,830 --> 02:24:50,170
That's part of the maze.

3410
02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:51,190
You have to crouch.

3411
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:52,190
Is it?

3412
02:24:53,570 --> 02:24:54,250
Oh, I'm not...

3413
02:24:54,250 --> 02:24:54,790
Kumi.

3414
02:24:55,830 --> 02:24:56,730
Kumi, I think.

3415
02:24:57,650 --> 02:24:58,070
Kumi.

3416
02:25:00,170 --> 02:25:01,730
Kumi, I think I fucked up.

3417
02:25:07,070 --> 02:25:07,910
Kumi, where...

3418
02:25:07,910 --> 02:25:09,710
Kumi, where are...

3419
02:25:09,710 --> 02:25:10,710
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3420
02:25:10,910 --> 02:25:11,430
This way is dead.

3421
02:25:11,430 --> 02:25:12,010
That's a dead end.

3422
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:12,610
That's a dead end.

3423
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:14,350
How would it take an hour?

3424
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:15,410
It can't be...

3425
02:25:15,410 --> 02:25:17,210
That maze can't be that big.

3426
02:25:17,490 --> 02:25:18,310
There's no way here.

3427
02:25:21,950 --> 02:25:24,990
No, don't say that.

3428
02:25:25,050 --> 02:25:25,870
Don't say that.

3429
02:25:25,870 --> 02:25:28,570
Please, I want to go get food.

3430
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:29,710
Don't say that.

3431
02:25:29,730 --> 02:25:30,490
I want to eat.

3432
02:25:32,470 --> 02:25:34,610
I'll get something nice to eat today.

3433
02:25:35,630 --> 02:25:36,150
No!

3434
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:38,790
Wait!

3435
02:25:39,070 --> 02:25:39,610
Second floor!

3436
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:40,330
Second floor!

3437
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:42,510
This is...

3438
02:25:42,510 --> 02:25:44,010
Okay, okay, okay.

3439
02:25:44,330 --> 02:25:45,030
Nice, nice.

3440
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:46,310
Wait, how many floors is this?

3441
02:25:48,090 --> 02:25:49,170
How many floors is this?

3442
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:50,450
Oh.

3443
02:25:51,990 --> 02:25:52,510
Oh.

3444
02:25:54,030 --> 02:25:55,930
There's some extra information, guys.

3445
02:25:56,110 --> 02:25:58,250
There's some extra information that might help you out a lot more.

3446
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:00,550
So...

3447
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:03,970
Sometimes you have to go down in order to go up.

3448
02:26:05,110 --> 02:26:05,770
Down is up!

3449
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:06,830
I always knew it.

3450
02:26:07,610 --> 02:26:09,790
I always knew down is up.

3451
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:12,710
Wait, but then...

3452
02:26:13,130 --> 02:26:14,290
Who's telling you that?

3453
02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:15,830
It's my motto.

3454
02:26:16,130 --> 02:26:16,990
Down is always up.

3455
02:26:17,430 --> 02:26:17,790
Sometimes, though.

3456
02:26:18,290 --> 02:26:19,130
Only sometimes.

3457
02:26:19,350 --> 02:26:21,410
Oh, so that was just a bait.

3458
02:26:21,410 --> 02:26:23,390
Wait, but then there's this side, too.

3459
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:24,570
Wait, there's another down here!

3460
02:26:24,630 --> 02:26:25,750
There's another down here!

3461
02:26:26,810 --> 02:26:27,610
Down is up!

3462
02:26:28,130 --> 02:26:29,290
And there's another up here!

3463
02:26:39,150 --> 02:26:41,830
Maybe we'll get another down is up.

3464
02:26:46,150 --> 02:26:46,570
Oh, yeah!

3465
02:26:46,690 --> 02:26:48,210
What do these markings mean?

3466
02:26:50,630 --> 02:26:53,850
So, the markings are what people left before you.

3467
02:26:54,090 --> 02:26:56,170
So, you see how you're dropping leather on the floor?

3468
02:26:56,550 --> 02:26:56,670
Yeah.

3469
02:26:57,010 --> 02:26:57,770
People have left markings.

3470
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:04,970
Do you like us more than Saekuno?

3471
02:27:07,230 --> 02:27:07,850
Oh, hey.

3472
02:27:10,330 --> 02:27:11,110
That's a load of...

3473
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:12,770
It depends on what time you get in the maze.

3474
02:27:13,390 --> 02:27:18,090
I'm saying, if you like us more than Saekuno, you'd let us be his time.

3475
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:20,910
Oh.

3476
02:27:21,970 --> 02:27:23,010
Yeah, you guys can do that.

3477
02:27:23,430 --> 02:27:24,650
You might as well just stop the time right now.

3478
02:27:24,650 --> 02:27:28,290
Yeah, you might as well just, like, you know, let us, tell us where we're, you know.

3479
02:27:28,290 --> 02:27:28,570
Oh, yeah.

3480
02:27:28,610 --> 02:27:29,290
True, true, true.

3481
02:27:29,290 --> 02:27:30,650
Yeah, and just be like...

3482
02:27:30,650 --> 02:27:32,390
Are we on the third floor or the second floor?

3483
02:27:32,670 --> 02:27:33,090
Yeah, you guys are the best.

3484
02:27:33,090 --> 02:27:34,910
I can't even tell anymore.

3485
02:27:35,170 --> 02:27:36,030
This is the second floor, Doki.

3486
02:27:36,150 --> 02:27:37,250
Now, this is the first floor.

3487
02:27:37,550 --> 02:27:38,670
Now, we're at the first floor?

3488
02:27:38,990 --> 02:27:41,430
Well, over here...

3489
02:27:41,430 --> 02:27:43,370
So, this is one above the, like...

3490
02:27:43,370 --> 02:27:44,310
Are we on the first floor?

3491
02:27:44,690 --> 02:27:46,990
I think I called it...

3492
02:27:46,990 --> 02:27:48,070
This is the third floor.

3493
02:27:49,950 --> 02:27:51,890
I think we called them floors differently.

3494
02:27:52,090 --> 02:27:54,010
So, for me, it goes ground, then one.

3495
02:27:54,330 --> 02:27:54,430
Oh, yeah.

3496
02:27:54,750 --> 02:27:57,170
Alright, well, this server is based in America.

3497
02:27:57,670 --> 02:27:58,100
So, like...

3498
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:00,470
Yeah, so...

3499
02:28:00,470 --> 02:28:02,270
So, it goes ground, then...

3500
02:28:02,270 --> 02:28:02,390
Doki, look.

3501
02:28:02,470 --> 02:28:03,410
We've been here before.

3502
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:04,830
No, we haven't.

3503
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:05,950
What's off the ground?

3504
02:28:06,790 --> 02:28:07,630
It's first floor.

3505
02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:08,930
Look at the freaking markings.

3506
02:28:09,190 --> 02:28:10,290
We talked about it.

3507
02:28:10,330 --> 02:28:12,250
No, no, but there's multiple markings.

3508
02:28:12,710 --> 02:28:13,670
You don't even know anymore.

3509
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:16,590
There's multiple markings.

3510
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:21,110
It's making me mad.

3511
02:28:21,370 --> 02:28:22,870
How long have you been stuck here?

3512
02:28:23,110 --> 02:28:23,610
I lost.

3513
02:28:25,870 --> 02:28:28,550
He's been stuck here for so long, he's changed his name to Lost.

3514
02:28:28,630 --> 02:28:29,650
He's literally lost.

3515
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:32,730
How long have you been here?

3516
02:28:32,910 --> 02:28:34,510
He's a paid actor with a name Lost.

3517
02:28:34,690 --> 02:28:36,950
He's a paid actor just to be Lost.

3518
02:28:37,130 --> 02:28:39,230
What is this rubber band doing?

3519
02:28:39,490 --> 02:28:42,030
I'm going to get someone else to change their name to Minotaur later.

3520
02:28:44,650 --> 02:28:45,530
The Minotaur.

3521
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:47,170
Look how slow I am.

3522
02:28:47,250 --> 02:28:49,030
I'm rubber banding so bad.

3523
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:51,730
Are you crouching, Lost?

3524
02:28:52,350 --> 02:28:53,810
Have you got a keybind for crouch?

3525
02:28:54,090 --> 02:28:55,410
He's not even been 20 minutes.

3526
02:28:56,190 --> 02:28:57,690
Doki, this is good.

3527
02:28:57,790 --> 02:28:58,710
We haven't been here yet.

3528
02:28:58,730 --> 02:28:59,990
It's giving me...

3529
02:28:59,990 --> 02:29:00,750
I don't know.

3530
02:29:01,410 --> 02:29:02,190
I'm getting flashbacks.

3531
02:29:02,210 --> 02:29:02,850
This is new, Doki.

3532
02:29:03,390 --> 02:29:04,350
I don't think...

3533
02:29:04,350 --> 02:29:05,870
This is the top floor, guys.

3534
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:07,390
This is the top floor?

3535
02:29:07,690 --> 02:29:08,910
This is the top floor, Doki.

3536
02:29:09,150 --> 02:29:10,210
Is this the top floor?

3537
02:29:15,490 --> 02:29:16,630
Down is up.

3538
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:17,570
Down is up.

3539
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:25,270
Down is always up.

3540
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:26,330
This is a dead end.

3541
02:29:26,430 --> 02:29:28,630
This is a dead end.

3542
02:29:28,950 --> 02:29:30,750
Can we make it to the next floor?

3543
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:31,990
I can't even...

3544
02:29:31,990 --> 02:29:33,810
All the floors are blurred together.

3545
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:37,170
I haven't been trapped here.

3546
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:42,270
How long have we been trapped here?

3547
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:46,070
Did we go this way yet?

3548
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:47,010
Did we go this way?

3549
02:29:47,490 --> 02:29:48,490
Oh, that's a dead end.

3550
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:51,450
You've been in here for 6 minutes and 15 seconds.

3551
02:29:52,010 --> 02:29:53,390
I'm gonna kill myself.

3552
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:55,290
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

3553
02:29:56,250 --> 02:29:57,790
You have to say in-game.

3554
02:29:57,870 --> 02:29:59,050
You have to say in-game after that.

3555
02:29:59,070 --> 02:30:00,930
How long has this girl been trapped here?

3556
02:30:01,090 --> 02:30:02,330
How long has she been here?

3557
02:30:04,270 --> 02:30:07,230
The person trapped in here has been in there for like...

3558
02:30:07,230 --> 02:30:08,830
For like...

3559
02:30:08,830 --> 02:30:09,710
An hour now.

3560
02:30:10,210 --> 02:30:13,050
Are you okay, ma'am?

3561
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:17,890
No.

3562
02:30:17,890 --> 02:30:19,770
No, I'm not okay.

3563
02:30:20,030 --> 02:30:20,490
I'm not okay.

3564
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:21,830
I'm not okay.

3565
02:30:23,090 --> 02:30:24,950
There's a dead body here.

3566
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:26,990
There's a...

3567
02:30:27,770 --> 02:30:29,770
There's a dead body here.

3568
02:30:30,070 --> 02:30:30,550
Who is it?

3569
02:30:31,890 --> 02:30:32,890
What's his name?

3570
02:30:33,970 --> 02:30:34,610
That's...

3571
02:30:34,610 --> 02:30:34,650
It's...

3572
02:30:37,690 --> 02:30:39,470
It's your paid actor.

3573
02:30:40,510 --> 02:30:42,110
It's your paid actor.

3574
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:44,880
You didn't...

3575
02:30:46,420 --> 02:30:48,770
You didn't beat your paid actor.

3576
02:30:48,910 --> 02:30:49,590
What happened?

3577
02:30:51,990 --> 02:30:54,890
I bought him on Fiverr and his timer ran out.

3578
02:30:55,110 --> 02:30:56,670
His timer ran out.

3579
02:30:57,630 --> 02:30:59,430
Have you guys seen Johnny recently?

3580
02:30:59,430 --> 02:31:00,690
Why would he leave me?

3581
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:02,770
I haven't seen Johnny recently.

3582
02:31:02,770 --> 02:31:05,010
Oh, I got such great acting.

3583
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:09,130
But that's where we came from.

3584
02:31:09,290 --> 02:31:10,690
Maybe there's another down here.

3585
02:31:14,530 --> 02:31:16,670
There's another down to go up.

3586
02:31:21,950 --> 02:31:23,650
Yeah, but we must find another down.

3587
02:31:23,730 --> 02:31:24,410
There's another down here!

3588
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:25,290
There's another down here!

3589
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:30,430
This is where we came from?

3590
02:31:31,930 --> 02:31:33,370
Is this where we came from?

3591
02:31:36,270 --> 02:31:37,710
Is this where we came from?

3592
02:31:38,490 --> 02:31:39,830
Is this where we came from?

3593
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:47,550
Yeah, but is this where we came from?

3594
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:53,570
Like, did we go up here?

3595
02:31:55,830 --> 02:31:56,570
Did we go up...

3596
02:31:58,190 --> 02:32:00,370
This is the second time.

3597
02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:06,530
You can't help him.

3598
02:32:06,970 --> 02:32:07,570
What do you mean?

3599
02:32:07,650 --> 02:32:08,330
Yes, he can.

3600
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:09,190
I have something.

3601
02:32:10,030 --> 02:32:10,990
Yes, I can.

3602
02:32:13,010 --> 02:32:15,610
There's a reason why he can help us right now.

3603
02:32:16,610 --> 02:32:18,450
Because he's stuck here with us.

3604
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:24,330
He's stuck here with us.

3605
02:32:26,570 --> 02:32:28,650
Oh my god.

3606
02:32:45,930 --> 02:32:48,490
I'd like a good story, please.

3607
02:32:56,570 --> 02:32:57,990
I was only allowed to talk to clay.

3608
02:32:58,350 --> 02:33:02,170
So I made clay figures, and I would talk to them, and I would evolve them like Pokemon.

3609
02:33:02,850 --> 02:33:04,790
And then, I think something in my brain snapped.

3610
02:33:05,330 --> 02:33:05,730
I don't know.

3611
02:33:07,790 --> 02:33:09,130
I don't know.

3612
02:33:09,210 --> 02:33:09,890
I really like this.

3613
02:33:10,090 --> 02:33:10,750
I love guys.

3614
02:33:12,050 --> 02:33:13,310
This clay guy is a cool guy.

3615
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:13,810
I like Pokemon.

3616
02:33:15,750 --> 02:33:16,670
We went up.

3617
02:33:19,090 --> 02:33:19,890
Come here!

3618
02:33:22,910 --> 02:33:24,070
We did it!

3619
02:33:26,050 --> 02:33:27,010
Really impressive.

3620
02:33:27,310 --> 02:33:28,230
What's our time?

3621
02:33:28,330 --> 02:33:28,870
What's our time?

3622
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:29,810
That was fast.

3623
02:33:30,030 --> 02:33:30,610
What's our time?

3624
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:31,550
Oh my god.

3625
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:32,450
What do you think it was?

3626
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:33,870
How?

3627
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:35,750
Was it faster than Saikuno?

3628
02:33:36,110 --> 02:33:36,910
Maybe 12?

3629
02:33:37,810 --> 02:33:38,130
No.

3630
02:33:38,530 --> 02:33:38,950
Maybe 12?

3631
02:33:39,070 --> 02:33:39,710
Oh my god.

3632
02:33:39,790 --> 02:33:40,570
There's no way.

3633
02:33:40,570 --> 02:33:41,910
It was faster than Saikuno.

3634
02:33:41,990 --> 02:33:42,310
No.

3635
02:33:42,910 --> 02:33:44,030
We did it!

3636
02:33:44,090 --> 02:33:45,050
This is not fair.

3637
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:45,550
We did it!

3638
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:46,070
Yes.

3639
02:33:46,570 --> 02:33:47,730
This is not fair.

3640
02:33:47,950 --> 02:33:49,070
That's not fair.

3641
02:33:49,250 --> 02:33:50,930
That's not fucking fair.

3642
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:52,930
That's not fucking fair.

3643
02:33:52,930 --> 02:33:54,410
You just got in here.

3644
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:57,310
That's not fair.

3645
02:33:57,550 --> 02:33:59,250
You just got in here.

3646
02:33:59,870 --> 02:34:01,530
The Trauma Ducky W.

3647
02:34:01,690 --> 02:34:02,870
The Trauma Ducky W.

3648
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:08,030
He's stuck in here with us.

3649
02:34:08,230 --> 02:34:08,630
Okay.

3650
02:34:10,230 --> 02:34:12,390
I think the maid didn't want your trauma anymore.

3651
02:34:13,930 --> 02:34:16,010
The Trauma Ducky W.

3652
02:34:16,530 --> 02:34:16,950
Guys.

3653
02:34:17,450 --> 02:34:18,110
Guys.

3654
02:34:18,670 --> 02:34:20,810
I'm gonna write your names on the board.

3655
02:34:21,030 --> 02:34:21,690
Yeah!

3656
02:34:21,690 --> 02:34:23,430
We did it!

3657
02:34:26,450 --> 02:34:28,390
Gamer of the year right here.

3658
02:34:28,590 --> 02:34:29,910
Gamer of the year.

3659
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:31,970
This should be my clip.

3660
02:34:32,790 --> 02:34:33,970
That should be my clip.

3661
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:37,670
Oh my god.

3662
02:34:37,710 --> 02:34:38,410
She's crying.

3663
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:46,750
How long have you been trapped there?

3664
02:34:47,470 --> 02:34:49,370
How long have you been trapped there?

3665
02:34:51,690 --> 02:34:53,170
How many days has it been?

3666
02:34:53,270 --> 02:34:53,790
I don't know.

3667
02:34:55,390 --> 02:34:55,570
Okay.

3668
02:34:55,910 --> 02:34:56,990
Oh my god!

3669
02:34:57,050 --> 02:34:59,490
We have nine minutes!

3670
02:35:00,170 --> 02:35:01,250
Oh yeah!

3671
02:35:01,970 --> 02:35:02,770
Let's go!

3672
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:04,170
Let's go.

3673
02:35:04,530 --> 02:35:06,170
We're so good at this.

3674
02:35:06,810 --> 02:35:09,190
We could have got faster time if we didn't threaten him.

3675
02:35:09,450 --> 02:35:10,050
Oh my god.

3676
02:35:11,370 --> 02:35:12,750
I'm gonna kill you.

3677
02:35:14,990 --> 02:35:16,130
Oh my god.

3678
02:35:16,210 --> 02:35:16,590
Congratulations.

3679
02:35:17,030 --> 02:35:17,050
So.

3680
02:35:17,390 --> 02:35:17,930
Yeah.

3681
02:35:18,130 --> 02:35:20,210
Do you guys want to do it again and get an even better score?

3682
02:35:20,210 --> 02:35:20,470
No.

3683
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:20,970
That's fine.

3684
02:35:21,230 --> 02:35:21,450
No.

3685
02:35:21,890 --> 02:35:22,590
That's okay.

3686
02:35:22,950 --> 02:35:23,630
We're done.

3687
02:35:23,750 --> 02:35:24,630
Thanks for the maze.

3688
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:25,750
It was a great maze.

3689
02:35:26,390 --> 02:35:27,410
Thank you so much.

3690
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:27,610
GG's.

3691
02:35:29,090 --> 02:35:29,530
GG's.

3692
02:35:30,170 --> 02:35:30,610
GG's.

3693
02:35:31,150 --> 02:35:33,510
Tell Sakuno he sucks and I like you better than him.

3694
02:35:36,290 --> 02:35:38,470
Who says trauma dumping gets you nowhere?

3695
02:35:39,430 --> 02:35:41,190
I mean, I did threaten him with it.

3696
02:35:41,290 --> 02:35:44,030
I was like, you don't want it when she starts trauma dumping.

3697
02:35:47,330 --> 02:35:50,590
That girl is still trapped in there.

3698
02:35:51,390 --> 02:35:53,830
I can't believe the guy died.

3699
02:35:54,070 --> 02:35:57,030
I can't believe the paid actor died.

3700
02:36:00,310 --> 02:36:02,470
They're like, why didn't you say anything?

3701
02:36:02,850 --> 02:36:04,410
I can't believe it.

3702
02:36:06,390 --> 02:36:07,450
Alright, Gumi.

3703
02:36:08,290 --> 02:36:09,090
You want to take...

3704
02:36:09,090 --> 02:36:13,330
Is there a safe spot that you could take me where I can rest and not die?

3705
02:36:13,450 --> 02:36:14,010
Because I was sleeping.

3706
02:36:14,010 --> 02:36:14,610
Sleeping bag.

3707
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:17,350
Alright.

3708
02:36:28,700 --> 02:36:31,080
I can't believe it, guys.

3709
02:36:31,160 --> 02:36:31,760
We're gamers.

3710
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:35,760
I'm going back to the coma.

3711
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:40,640
We're actually gamers, Gumi.

3712
02:36:40,820 --> 02:36:41,660
Look at us go.

3713
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:43,220
Alright.

3714
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:45,840
Woah, there's like apartments now?

3715
02:36:50,450 --> 02:36:53,430
I think we would've been rank one if we didn't threaten the tour guide.

3716
02:36:54,470 --> 02:36:57,670
We literally wasted time threatening him.

3717
02:36:57,710 --> 02:36:59,610
Yeah, we didn't spend time doing that.

3718
02:36:59,770 --> 02:37:00,070
Yeah.

3719
02:37:08,830 --> 02:37:10,790
Alright, I'm turning left.

3720
02:37:17,530 --> 02:37:19,130
Is this your new house?

3721
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:25,840
Oh, that's our...

3722
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:27,920
The friend.

3723
02:37:28,580 --> 02:37:30,660
Yep, I can't get out of the house.

3724
02:37:31,420 --> 02:37:33,840
Yeah, Hannah Montana, how do I get out of this house?

3725
02:37:35,180 --> 02:37:36,200
What's the code?

3726
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:42,680
How would I know you'd be online?

3727
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:52,200
No, no, 100%.

3728
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:53,380
I got robbed last time.

3729
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:55,840
In my own house.

3730
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:56,700
Yeah.

3731
02:37:58,420 --> 02:38:00,340
Wait, where's my sleeping bag?

3732
02:38:02,680 --> 02:38:03,720
It's over here.

3733
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:14,360
Is this mine?

3734
02:38:14,580 --> 02:38:15,440
I don't even remember.

3735
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:18,620
No, my name was... mine was Hannah Montana.

3736
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:22,560
How many doors?

3737
02:38:22,780 --> 02:38:23,340
Is this mine?

3738
02:38:26,490 --> 02:38:27,950
Where's my Hannah Montana?

3739
02:38:29,290 --> 02:38:30,310
It's this way.

3740
02:38:31,270 --> 02:38:32,310
Where's Hannah Montana?

3741
02:38:33,930 --> 02:38:35,250
Over here, over here.

3742
02:38:35,350 --> 02:38:35,770
Turn around.

3743
02:38:39,490 --> 02:38:40,910
How do I... how do I get off?

3744
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:42,230
Oh, there it is.

3745
02:38:45,670 --> 02:38:47,710
And right here is your sleeping bag.

3746
02:38:48,850 --> 02:38:49,710
Oh my god, Hannah Montana!

3747
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:50,890
Wait, I'm stuck.

3748
02:38:51,230 --> 02:38:51,810
I'm stuck.

3749
02:38:53,350 --> 02:38:54,210
Okay, nice.

3750
02:38:58,500 --> 02:38:58,980
Hannah Montana!

3751
02:38:59,520 --> 02:38:59,820
Alright.

3752
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:02,440
Thanks for doing the maze with me.

3753
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:02,960
Good luck.

3754
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:06,400
Good luck with the rest of your day on the rest server.

3755
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:08,600
I'll see you tomorrow on the last day.

3756
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:11,100
I'll see you tomorrow.

3757
02:39:11,900 --> 02:39:12,380
Alright.

3758
02:39:12,700 --> 02:39:15,020
Wait, I'll message you in... are you going?

3759
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:16,500
I'm gonna go get food.

3760
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:19,340
I'm gonna go get dinner.

3761
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:20,480
I know, you're getting food.

3762
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:20,840
I know.

3763
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:26,580
Alright, I'll see you later.

3764
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,900
Are you gonna keep streaming?

3765
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:29,340
I'll message you later tonight.

3766
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:30,800
Alright, bye bye!

3767
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:33,300
I'm going to go harass people for money.

3768
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:34,400
Alright, bye!

3769
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:36,840
Wait!

3770
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:37,900
Wait!

3771
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:39,500
Here.

3772
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:41,560
Did you log off already?

3773
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:42,320
No, I'm here.

3774
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:42,560
What?

3775
02:39:43,740 --> 02:39:44,680
Wait, I'm here.

3776
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:44,920
I'm here.

3777
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:45,220
What?

3778
02:39:45,420 --> 02:39:46,220
This is the safest spot.

3779
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:48,020
Oh, this is the safest spot?

3780
02:39:50,780 --> 02:39:53,340
Yeah, because who's gonna fucking look in here for you?

3781
02:39:54,580 --> 02:39:56,520
I can't even... Okay, I can't get in.

3782
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:57,340
I can't get in.

3783
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,000
I can't get in.

3784
02:40:00,720 --> 02:40:01,820
Maybe I'll just be here.

3785
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:03,440
You gotta angle yourself, man.

3786
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:05,300
You can't even get in!

3787
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:05,980
What do you mean?

3788
02:40:08,020 --> 02:40:09,400
Okay, look who's in here!

3789
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:11,040
Yeah, but you can't get in here!

3790
02:40:11,740 --> 02:40:14,260
Okay, I give up.

3791
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:16,600
I can't do it!

3792
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:20,600
You can't even do it!

3793
02:40:22,420 --> 02:40:23,600
You're in my way!

3794
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:25,680
I'm literally 20 miles away!

3795
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:26,320
I'm 20 miles away.

3796
02:40:26,360 --> 02:40:26,760
I'm 20 miles.

3797
02:40:26,840 --> 02:40:27,740
I'm not even...

3798
02:40:27,740 --> 02:40:28,300
Oh, yeah?

3799
02:40:28,820 --> 02:40:30,040
Oh, yeah, I'm in the way.

3800
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:31,660
I'm in the way.

3801
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:32,460
Oh, yeah.

3802
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:34,600
You're making me nervous!

3803
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:35,220
Turn around!

3804
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:36,020
Oh, yeah.

3805
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:39,560
Yeah, you... Turn around!

3806
02:40:40,520 --> 02:40:42,320
We just had three wars.

3807
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:43,180
I'm tired.

3808
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:46,320
How?

3809
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:53,500
How?

3810
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:54,740
You turn around!

3811
02:40:56,960 --> 02:40:57,920
Okay, I'm turning around.

3812
02:40:58,460 --> 02:40:59,700
Yeah, you turn around!

3813
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:02,560
You're not... You're watching.

3814
02:41:02,920 --> 02:41:04,580
How am I supposed to... I give up.

3815
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:05,740
I'm fucking logging off right here.

3816
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:08,140
Oh, my God.

3817
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:12,720
I almost did it.

3818
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,640
I almost had it.

3819
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:15,600
How am I supposed to get out?

3820
02:41:15,680 --> 02:41:16,400
No, I'm not gonna do it.

3821
02:41:16,420 --> 02:41:17,200
