00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,290
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,270
Okay guys, I woke up a little bit.

3
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,250
Because like, I woke up and then I was like, wait a minute.

4
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,110
Where's my room?

5
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,950
Where's my, where's my good night dragon's room?

6
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,390
My room!

7
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,910
Because like, so you know how I'm on a new PC.

8
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,790
So because of that, I forgot to, some of the assets I forgot to move.

9
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,110
What is it being?

10
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,610
The room I broke into.

11
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,710
You know, the room I'm borrowing for good night dragoons.

12
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:28,450
So that was like, six minutes of me trying to find, find, you know, because you know, I'm directionally challenged.

13
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,010
So I didn't bring my map with me to find this room again.

14
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,630
The map was in my old PC.

15
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:43,590
And so like, I had to get Google Maps and try to figure out like, where is this room that broke into for good night dragoons?

16
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,170
I also sort of got a head, a head start in the good night part.

17
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,450
Because I took a nap.

18
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,890
I took a nap.

19
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,450
I'm so tired.

20
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,950
I got...

21
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:05,890
I got a little head start with the good night part, and started eating before I did the good night stream.

22
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,030
So...

23
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,410

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,610
The alarm is too quiet.

97
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,430
You should play again.

98
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,370
But way louder.

99
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,490
Remember, this is... this is an employee of my team.

100
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,270
He's... he's literally gets paid to tell me to put it louder.

101
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,510
Be careful, sound guy.

102
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,530
That's how revolts start.

103
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,070
You're so evil.

104
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,650
Sound guy, no!

105
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,890
You're supposed to be for the people!

106
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,490

107
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,590

108
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,610

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,670
Um.

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,190
Wake me up.

112
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,510

113
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,430
Anyway.

114
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:22,970
Um.

115
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,710
What was that?

116
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:24,950
Yes!

117
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,590
I was gonna say I am eating something right now.

118
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,810
I am eating...

119
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,490
元子甘农.

120
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,790
So for those who don't know what it is...

121
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,750
I'm trying to remember what the English name is again.

122
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,270
It's a mango pomelo sago.

123
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,730
So basically it is a...

124
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,510
It is a famous Hong Kong dessert.

125
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,330
Um.

126
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,130
It's actually one of my favorite desserts in the world.

127
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,050
So...

128
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,490
Uh...

129
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:47,650
Uh.

130
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,870
And I woke up.

131
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,810
I dragged myself to my PC.

132
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,390
And then my dad just got home.

133
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,430
And he was like...

134
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,050
Oh hey!

135
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,610
Do you want 元子甘农?

136
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,750
We just bought it.

137
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,170
And I was like...

138
00:08:59,170 --> 00:08:59,610

Uh.

142
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,550

143
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,050
Wait wait.

144
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,890
I want to make sure I say your name correctly.

145
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,490
Grabbing up my Google Translate.

146
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,310
Because I can't read any language.

147
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,970
Let alone English.

148
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,590
English.

149
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,510

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,630
Some of my mods can...

00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,630
I can actually provide like...

187
00:09:59,630 --> 00:09:59,910
Uh.

188
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,250
Uh.

189
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,710
Provide money for my mods.

190
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,210
Uh.

191
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,470
To let them keep doing what they're doing.

192
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,430
So yes.

193
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,810
They do get paid now.

194
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,590
And...

195
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:08,950
Uh.

196
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:09,930
Uh.

197
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,510
They used to do this work for free.

198
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,250
Uh.

199
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,910
Out of the goodness of their hearts.

200
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,690
And because they are...

201
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,290
Uh.

202
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,610
They love working for me.

203
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,810
And now...

204
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,010
Now I pay them.

205
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,210
Because I think they still love working.

206
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,250
And now I pay them because it's Stockholm Syndrome now.

207
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,830
Now I can never leave.

208
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,930
Uh.

209
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,530
Potter!

210
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,110
Thank you for the 20 gift-a-ships!

211
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,390
Thank you!

212
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,050
Thank you!

213
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,390
I really appreciate it!

214
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,290
Thank you so much!

215
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,150
Uh.

216
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:39,650
Yeah.

217
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,070
They get...

218
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,370
They get yelled at by me.

219
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,750
And they get paid.

220
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,550
Now you can leave!

221
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,470
Yeah.

222
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,430
They're too deep to leave now!

223
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,870
So yes!

224
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,050
They do get paid!

225
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:51,770
Yay!

226
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,830
I know like it's not really like a common thing to do.

227
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,950
Like paying your mods.

228
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:57,890
Um.

229
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,350
Because like I said like you know.

230
00:10:59,510 --> 00:10:59,950
Uh.

231
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,410
You have to be able to...

232
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,030
I guess like...

233
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,610
To be able to earn enough.

234
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,510
To be able to do so.

235
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,790
Because there's always like there's so many other expenses going on behind the scenes.

236
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,670
Um.

237
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,050
But luckily...

238
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,010
Finally I am able to like...

239
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,450
Uh.

240
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,210
I guess like...

241
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:14,770
Uh.

242
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,310
Be able to do all these projects.

243
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,710
Be able to...

244
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,290
Uh.

245
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,210
Do all these projects.

246
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,610
Plan all these things.

247
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,150
Uh.

248
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,030
All my expenses.

249
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,370
And also...

250
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,770
Pay my mods!

251
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,030
Because you see them here almost every stream.

252
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,030
And I really appreciate it.

253
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,530
I really appreciate them being there.

254
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,710
Every stream.

255
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,690
Um.

256
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,150
And doing so many things for me.

257
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:38,630
You know.

258
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:39,670
Advertise...

259
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,970
Reminding me to...

260
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,390
Advertise stuff.

261
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,530
Because I always forget.

262
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,190
Um.

263
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,390
Uh.

264
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:51,310
My mods always reminding me about like obligations that I have to do.

265
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,370
Like you know.

266
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:52,750
Be like...

267
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,070
Hey guys!

268
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,570
Remember that I'm sponsored by YouTube and GamerStuff?

269
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,390
I always forget to say stuff like that.

270
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,350
Don't worry.

271
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,630
My mods got me.

272
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,130
Uh.

273
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,090
They post...

274
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,930
They give us like reminders and everything in chat.

275
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,750
Which is great.

276
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,490
Uh.

277
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,090
So yes!

278
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,450
And then we have Sound Guy who does like sound check up.

279
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,390
Like I always say...

280
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,370
I say...

281
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,690
I think that like...

282
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,070
One of the most important things...

283
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,030
You need to have...

284
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,970
When it comes to like...

285
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,230
If you want to be a streamer...

286
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,210
Is to have good sound quality.

287
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,190
Like...

288
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,290
Like the first thing...

289
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,950
People would look at...

290
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,750
Is if like...

291
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,570
The sound quality is okay.

292
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,710
Like the audio balancing and stuff is okay.

293
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,030
Because at the moment...

294
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,990
If the audio balancing is not great...

295
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,450
They leave.

296
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,710
They leave the stream.

297
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,570
Because...

298
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,270
I hate watching streams with bad audio balancing.

299
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,630
So I assume you guys would hate it too.

300
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,290
That's why I have a dedicated Sound Guy.

301
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,050
And I always...

302
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,930
Like give them...

303
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,590
Like...

304
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,390
Like my feedback too.

305
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,570
Give my Sound Guy...

306
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,430
My feedback.

307
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,530
Being like...

308
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:50,910
Hey...

309
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,070
I think I prefer...

310
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,710
Like if...

311
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,790
Like if we continue doing this game...

312
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,950
If I do a part two...

313
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,730
I prefer the game sound was...

314
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,650
A little bit louder.

315
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,490
Or like...

316
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,450
I didn't like how the game sound was...

317
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,270
Louder than me.

318
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,030
So could you like balance that...

319
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,770
In regards to that next time?

320
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,310
Because like...

321
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,110
Then you get to know my preferences and everything.

322
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,590
So yeah...

323
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,790
The Sound Guy gets yelled at me...

324
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,150
Almost like every other show.

325
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,050
So yeah...

326
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,590
The Sound Guy sort of...

327
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,790
Gets scolded by me every...

328
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,790
Like every two to three streams.

329
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,090
So they deserve to get paid.

330
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,710
Yeah...

331
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,570
But they get paid.

332
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,390
So it's fine.

333
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,070
So it's okay.

334
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,330
Thank you for the super chat.

335
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,850
Thank you.

336
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,550
Thank you.

337
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,470
Thank you.

338
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:41,710
Thank you.

339
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,490
Thank you.

340
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:42,830
Thank you.

341
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,110
Thank you.

342
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,130
Thank you.

343
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,690
Thank you.

344
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,030
Thank you.

345
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,410
I really appreciate it.

346
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:45,750
Thank you.

347
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,690
No...

348
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,930
Don't keep...

349
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,690
No don't keep...

350
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,190
Shut up!

351
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,550
But yeah...

352
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:58,970
Also...

353
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,970
I sort of...

354
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:00,950
Low...

355
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,430
Okay...

356
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,370
It wasn't low key...

357
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:02,930
Because...

358
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,550
Because that tweet got a lot of traction.

359
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,490
But...

360
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,050
I sort of like...

361
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,050
Revealed...

362
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,730
That...

363
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,050
The whole year...

364
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,050
Technically...

365
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,710
Is...

366
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,010
A little bit...

367
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,610
Booked...

368
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,330
With...

369
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,090
Events...

370
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,050
Or projects...

371
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,070
Or sponsors...

372
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,770
So...

373
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,950
Every month...

374
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,230
There's something to look forward to guys.

375
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,650

376
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,490
I know I said fully booked...

377
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,310

378
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,130

403
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,650
There's so many announcements...

404
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,830
When do they stop?

405
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,010
You gotta rest!

406
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,950
Stop?

407
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,150
What do you mean?

408
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:26,750
Stop?

409
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,690
It's the Doki year...

410
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,050
It's the year of the Doki...

411
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,410
What do you mean?

412
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,010
Stop?

413
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,290
If you think those are all the conventions I'm gonna go...

414
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,910
This year...

415
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,670
Guys...

416
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,410
It says...

417
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,930
World Tour...

418
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,830
There's...

419
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,930
A specific...

420
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,010
There's a...

421
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,390
There's a...

422
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,750
Some...

423
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,510
There's a region that I haven't listed yet...

424
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,030
In terms of conventions...

425
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,990
Guys...

426
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,590
We have conventions for NA...

427
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,430
We have conventions for EU...

428
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,650
But we are missing conventions for a region...

429
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,350
That we haven't announced yet...

430
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,290
That's not...

431
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,650
That's...

432
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,730
That's like...

433
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,330
You know...

434
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:04,810
You know...

435
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,010
There's no conventions announced yet...

436
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,410
For a region...

437
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,070
Um...

438
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,110
And I did say...

439
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,370
World Tour...

440
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,490
Okay...

441
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,130
I'm sorry...

442
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,130
But...

443
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,170
I don't want to get your hopes up...

444
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,030
But I don't want to lie...

445
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,370
I'm sorry.

446
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,470
I'm sorry...

447
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,790
I have to like...

448
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,230
I saw...

449
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,290
I saw a lot of people very excited...

450
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,350
I'm sorry...

451
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,670
Guys...

452
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,650
I have to let you guys down right now...

453
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,150
Doki!

454
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:37,590
No!

455
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,770
You said...

456
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,410
World Tour...

457
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,750
Doki!

458
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,870
What do you mean?

459
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,110
I'm sorry...

460
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:52,770
Guys, all I'm saying is like, guys you gotta get conventions to invite me there guys.

461
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,130
I think a lot of conventions in Latin America don't know who I am.

462
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,930
I haven't got any invite from Latin America, I'm so sorry.

463
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,410
If I had, if I get an invite, I would say yes.

464
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:15,270
Guys, I would say yes if I get an invite over there, but I don't think I got a single invite yet.

465
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:20,130
I'll say yet, because maybe, maybe next year or the end of the year, it'll be different.

466
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:28,810
Like, I was gonna... guys, I had to like, let, I had to let like, South America down.

467
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,590
I don't, I don't wanna get their hopes up, I'm so sorry.

468
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,690
But other than that, there's a region...

469
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:36,850
...

470
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,110
Excluding South America, I'm very sorry.

471
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,190
I'm very sorry!

472
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:50,930
That we haven't, that we haven't announced a convention for it yet.

473
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,570
So keep your eyes open, cause there's more announcements coming!

474
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,470
Uh-huh.

475
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,810
Squibbly, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

476
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,170
Cries in Spanish.

477
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,070
Zpie, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

478
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,350
How do you feel about onion rings or ring pops?

479
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,150
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

480
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,070
I mean, onion rings are pretty, um, uh, pretty goaded.

481
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,930
I like onion rings.

482
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,470
I haven't had a ring pop in so long.

483
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,310
I think it's cause it's like, it's like super sweet.

484
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,810
I haven't had a ring pop in a long time.

485
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,590
I don't like candy.

486
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,590
I'll just say, I'm not a big fan of candy.

487
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,770
I prefer chocolate more than candy.

488
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,790
The only types of candy I like is cotton candy.

489
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,010
But only like cotton candy ice cream.

490
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,630
Um, I like, I can't have like, like I don't know.

491
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,710
It's just, it's just, I'm not a huge fan of like, um, candies in general.

492
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,210
I just think it's like way too sweet.

493
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,370
So I prefer, I prefer just chocolate.

494
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,230
I like milk chocolate.

495
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,370
But then people will call me a loser for liking milk chocolate.

496
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,770
But I am not afraid to tell you what I like.

497
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,170
I'm not, I'm here to represent the milk chocolate gang.

498
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,270
You'll say people who like milk chocolate are losers.

499
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,150
But I don't care.

500
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,990
I might be the biggest loser out there.

501
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,670
But I will defend milk chocolate.

502
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,890
They give the magenta soup.

503
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,570
But they can thank you.

504
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,390
But we have money.

505
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,550
They give the magenta soup.

506
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,070
But they can, they might say milk chocolate is for babies.

507
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,790
But I know what I like.

508
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,290
I hate dark chocolate.

509
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,930
Okay, um, fuck dark chocolate.

510
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,410
That is my controversial statement of the day.

511
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:49,170
That is my, that is my, um, my hate statement of the day.

512
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,730
Fuck dark chocolate.

513
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,470
It wishes it was as good as milk chocolate.

514
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,750
I know dark chocolate is healthy for you.

515
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,350
Because the darker the chocolate, the more cocoa in the chocolate.

516
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,050
The more healthy.

517
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,430
The more health benefits you get.

518
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,350
You can try and cancel me.

519
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,170
But I know what I like.

520
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,090
It's okay to be wrong.

521
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,750
Dark chocolate.

522
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,510
It does, I just don't, it's just bitter.

523
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,850
It tastes bitter.

524
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,510
I just don't like dark chocolate.

525
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,410
It tastes so bitter.

526
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,810
It doesn't matter if it's healthier.

527
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,950
I'm not eating chocolate to be healthy.

528
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,030
Like what the fuck is chocolate?

529
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,330
Chocolate is like the cheap food.

530
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,730
Why am I eating chocolate to be healthier?

531
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,190
I eat what I want to eat to be like, I want to eat something sweet today.

532
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,040
You're tasting the wrong one.

533
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,440
Look, it's okay to be wrong.

534
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,940
I'm thinking of a super chat.

535
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,360
Thank you.

536
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,100
Thank you.

537
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,060
It's okay.

538
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,680
You're still my Oshii.

539
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,560
Even that's higher.

540
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,960
Thank you.

541
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,820
Thank you.

542
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,580
Thank you.

543
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,960
It's okay to be wrong.

544
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,920
I mean, I'm right obviously.

545
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,900
Yes.

546
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,700
Okay.

547
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,380
Yes.

548
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,480
Yes.

549
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,320
I know.

550
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,220
Milk chocolate is cheaper.

551
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,840
But I am the, I am for the people.

552
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,520
I'm not the bourgeoisie.

553
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,100
That's why I am for the people.

554
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,780
That's why I like milk chocolate more than dark chocolate.

555
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,240
I am for the people.

556
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,720
Dark chocolate just tastes better.

557
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,660
I mean, yeah.

558
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,760
If you don't have enough, yeah.

559
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,200
If you don't have enough taste buds, I guess you can see.

560
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,660
I'm going to start a chocolate.

561
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,120
Chocolate war.

562
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,980
Borg, thank you for the five...

563
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,340
gift of chips.

564
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,260
Thank you.

565
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,240
Thank you.

566
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,140
I like how this is where I cross the line.

567
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,560
By talking dark chocolate.

568
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,940
By being a milk choc- Like by having milk chocolate as my Oshie.

569
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,360
This is the line where it's crossed.

570
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,900
This is where dragoons feel attacked.

571
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,720
That was the moment.

572
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,140
The downfall of DokiBaron.

573
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,400
When she gave her opinion on chocolate.

574
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,260
But yes, that is what I prefer.

575
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,320
And then like if you like regular.

576
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,580
I guess like...

577
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,580
And then there's some freaks that like the medium between the two.

578
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,680
Like regular chocolate.

579
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,220
Like why?

580
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,820
Why?

581
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,580
Oh my gosh.

582
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:00,880
Okay.

583
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,580
I think it's funny.

584
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,800
Have you guys... you know like what was it?

585
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,880
The Mr. Beast Feastables?

586
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,480
Apparently... okay.

587
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,400
Oh my gosh.

588
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,920
Mr. Beast is so fucking rich.

589
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,320
Like...

590
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,540
The fact that he just threw money at it.

591
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:25,060
And managed to convince a giant population of children to think that feastable chocolates like taste good.

592
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
Like taste good.

593
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,410
Like taste good.

594
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,090
Like taste good.

595
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,390
I'm gonna put this in my video.

596
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,570
I'll play Minecraft for you.

597
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,910
I'll play Minecraft for you.

598
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,730
I'll play Minecraft for you.

599
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,150
Mr. Beast.

600
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,030
If you send me a package of feastables.

601
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,050
Mr. Beast.

602
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,270
If you send me a package of feastables.

603
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,050
Don't worry my calendar is open for you Mr. Beast.

604
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:55,310
Don't worry my calendar is open for you Mr. Beast.

605
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,770
So if you want to send me...

606
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,050
I see you sending content creators...

607
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,150
Feastable...

608
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,550
Feastable chocolates.

609
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,190
And like you know...

610
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,370
I can easily change my opinion.

611
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,130
You know?

612
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,190
I won't call it a bribe.

613
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,510
But like...

614
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,230
I mean everybody loves free stuff.

615
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,030
Um...

616
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,830
Gio thank you for the super chat.

617
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,230
Thank you.

618
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,770
Thank you.

619
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,270
People who like dark chocolate are old people.

620
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,190
Milk chocolate is the best.

621
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,290
I didn't say that.

622
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,870
That was Gio.

623
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,510
Thank you for the super chat.

624
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,190
Thank you.

625
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:38,810
Thank you.

626
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,230
I didn't say that.

627
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,210
That was Gio's opinion.

628
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,130
I mean her opinion is right.

629
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,890
But like I didn't say that.

630
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,930
Like it's not my opinion.

631
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,350
No.

632
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:55,490
Um...

633
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,990
Black thank you for the super chat.

634
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,450
Thank you.

635
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,470
Um...

636
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,050
Unfollows my mutual.

637
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:04,730
Um...

638
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,930
No you know like...

639
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,910
Old people...

640
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,930
You know like old people always have like...

641
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,850
The old people candy.

642
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,150
Like the...

643
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,010
The straw...

644
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,070
You know like the strawberry wrapped candy.

645
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,050
And then like the caramel...

646
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,350
Where do they get those?

647
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,730
How do all the elderly just know exactly what to buy?

648
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,390
The grandma candies.

649
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,870
Yeah.

650
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,890
Like where...

651
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,030
Yeah the hard caramel.

652
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,150
And then like the strawberry wrapped...

653
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,230
Uh...

654
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,970
The strawberry wrapped...

655
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,050
Not strawberry.

656
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,470
You know like those candies that have a strawberry wrapping.

657
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,650
Those ones.

658
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,070
Where do they get those?

659
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,070
The dollar store?

660
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:46,790
There's no way.

661
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,670
There's no way grandmas are giving us dollar store candy.

662
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,430
Ha ha ha.

663
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,270
I feel like every elderly person just knows exactly...

664
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,270
Um...

665
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,510
Like where to get those candies.

666
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:01,910
Um...

667
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,390
Um...

668
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,970
Oh my gosh there's something else I want to talk about.

669
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,890
When it came to candy.

670
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:07,570
Sorry.

671
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,130
My brain is like still waking up.

672
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,770
It's like I need to rev my brain up.

673
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,150
I need to...

674
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,150
Oh!

675
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:14,970
But you know okay.

676
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,670
There's one I really...

677
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,030
Really miss.

678
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,170
People...

679
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,270
People in Asia might know what I'm talking...

680
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,210
You know like seitan?

681
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,370
You know that?

682
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,830
That shit was so good.

683
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,110
That and the rabbit one.

684
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,170
I don't remember what the rabbit candy is called.

685
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,190
So like...

686
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,550
There's like two candies I really...

687
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,390
They're actually like my favorite candies.

688
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:33,890
Like I know...

689
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,250
I'm not like a huge fan of candies.

690
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,690
But like if I see like seitan...

691
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,950
And um... the rabbit one.

692
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,110
The rabbit one.

693
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,570
Like I love that shit so much.

694
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,530
Yes the white rabbit.

695
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:44,850
Yeah!

696
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,370
That shit is so good.

697
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,110
Okay.

698
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,250
Alright for those who don't know about it or like don't live in Asia.

699
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,030
Or never seen it in like...

700
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,910
Um... Asian market.

701
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,750
You guys should really try these candies.

702
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,130
They're so fucking good.

703
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,650
That's like literally my childhood.

704
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,030
I don't eat it anymore because like...

705
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,210
I don't eat candy.

706
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,330
Ha ha ha.

707
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:04,910
I don't eat candy anymore.

708
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,010
But like if it does show up I will like...

709
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,330
You know... I will take one.

710
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,290
I'll take a piece.

711
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,450
Then...

712
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:13,810
Licy...

713
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,670
Uh... candy.

714
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,670
And there's licy candy.

715
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,910
Oh my gosh how do you...

716
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,070
Wait is it...

717
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,650
Uh... pocket candy?

718
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,750
What's it called in English?

719
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,190
Oh it is!

720
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,790
It's called Chinese good luck candy.

721
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,090
Okay this shit is fire.

722
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,730
Ha ha ha ha ha.

723
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,130
That shit is actually so good.

724
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:37,870
That shit is actually so good.

725
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,810
Alright yes it's JPEG.

726
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,690
Okay I'll post it.

727
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,070
I can show it on screen too.

728
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,670
Alright guys.

729
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,970
You guys gotta try this.

730
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,170
It's actually fire.

731
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,750
This shit is like so fucking good.

732
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,010
Um...

733
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,630
It's honestly like one of my favorite candies in the world.

734
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,050
It's honestly like one of my favorite candies in the world.

735
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,210
It's honestly like one of my favorite candies in the world.

736
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,450
I don't eat it as much anymore.

737
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,570
Like I barely eat candy these days.

738
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,090
But uh...

739
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,350
This shit is really good.

740
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,650
It's called... in English apparently it's called...

741
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,310
Uh... Chinese good luck candy.

742
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,290
I like how it's called Chinese good luck candy.

743
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,490
Good luck candy.

744
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,370
I like how it says good luck candy.

745
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,910
Guys if you eat it you get more good luck.

746
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,230
Anyway there's another one.

747
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,030
And this one is like white rabbit candy.

748
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,450
Um... it's called creamy candy.

749
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,150
Uh... please...

750
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,770
Uh... don't pay attention to the...

751
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,450
I know it's very...

752
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,430
Uh... weirdly named.

753
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,270
I know it's...

754
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,090
It's a little... the name is a little bit like...

755
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,930
Inappropriate.

756
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,650
But like trust me it's...

757
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,950
Don't focus on the creamy candy part.

758
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,310
Focus on the white rabbit.

759
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,570
Hahahaha.

760
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,470
Hahahaha.

761
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,750
Focus on white rabbit.

762
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,150
I didn't realize this was also the name.

763
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,230
Um...

764
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,470
Carlos thank you for the super chat.

765
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:56,750
Thank you.

766
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,090
That smug smile on my skin is really cute.

767
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,030
Also milk chocolate.

768
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,130
I told you.

769
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,390
For the people.

770
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,110
White chocolate is the best.

771
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,510
Okay but like...

772
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,010
Okay I'll tell you guys a story.

773
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,270
Um... there's a reason also why I don't eat this anymore.

774
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,250
Because it's also associated with like...

775
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,010
A low key traumatic experience.

776
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,010
Because I like... but like...

777
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,150
I like this candy too much.

778
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,790
So what happened...

779
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,210
Was that um...

780
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,310
Cough cough cough.

781
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,410
Cough cough cough.

782
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,870
Younger Doki was quite impulsive.

783
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,050
Hahahaha.

784
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,310
Little...

785
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,170
Little child Doki was a very Impulsive individual.

786
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:42,310
And like somebody left This bag candy Out in the open.

787
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,350
While I was uh...

788
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,210
Visiting... I think I was visiting my aunt or some shit.

789
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,090
So like um...

790
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,930
Um...

791
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,310
So little...

792
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,090
Little Doki was a very impulsive...

793
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,110
Not anymore of course.

794
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,850
Hahahaha.

795
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,050
I'm different now of course.

796
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,370
Guys.

797
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,810
But little Doki was very impulsive.

798
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,270
So you know...

799
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,090
Okay so like the thing about this particular...

800
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,090
Uh...

801
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,110
The thing about this particular...

802
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,950
Type of candy...

803
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,030
Is that...

804
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,670
It's very chewy and sticky.

805
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,950
So...

806
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,050
You know what little Doki did?

807
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,630
Little Doki...

808
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,890
I don't know how many I had.

809
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,810
Hahahaha.

810
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,910
But...

811
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,850
I stuffed my mouth...

812
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,070
With like at least...

813
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,990
Four to five...

814
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,910
Plus...

815
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,830
At once...

816
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,610
Instead of you know...

817
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,370
Sucking it like...

818
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,830
How you normally do with...

819
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,110
Hard candy...

820
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,150
I started chewing.

821
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,670
Hahahaha.

822
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,990
And...

823
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,330
And when you chew...

824
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,970
It gets stickier.

825
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,270
So...

826
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,330
What happened to little Doki...

827
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,870
Is that...

828
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,270
Um...

829
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,510
So I had silver teeth.

830
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,850
I don't know if I still...

831
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,690
I think I still do.

832
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,190
But like I had silver teeth.

833
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,650
Instead of braces.

834
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:15,630
Um...

835
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,150
Because I don't know if this is like an Asian thing.

836
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,330
But like...

837
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,150
But like I knew like back then instead of getting braces...

838
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,750
We...

839
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,550
People would get like silver...

840
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,730
Silver like...

841
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,810
They would put like silver casings...

842
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,910
Over...

843
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,550
Over like the tooth.

844
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,330
So...

845
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,010
So...

846
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,950
What happened?

847
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,850
Yeah the silver jackets.

848
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,990
It's like not even like silver...

849
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,590
It's like they are like jackets over a tooth instead of braces.

850
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:48,850
Uh...

851
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,690
Were for cavities.

852
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,710
Oh...

853
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,530
I didn't realize it was for cavity.

854
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,830
I thought they were for...

855
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,810
I was told they were for braces.

856
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,510
Well anyway...

857
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,110
I was a bad child.

858
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,070
That explains a lot.

859
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,190
Actually.

860
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,190
Okay.

861
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,230
Anyway.

862
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,470
That explains a lot.

863
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,610
That they were actually for cavities.

864
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,690
Anyway.

865
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,350
Um...

866
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,810
So yes.

867
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,010
I started chewing.

868
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,650
And yeah.

869
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,150
It was like a candy.

870
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,890
And the jacket...

871
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,890
Got stuck on the candy.

872
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,290
And it got off.

873
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,390
It got...

874
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,650
The casings...

875
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,690
Got off the tooth.

876
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,530
Because of the candy.

877
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:44,870
So...

878
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,190
Little Toki.

879
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,490
Despite loving White Rabbit.

880
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,270
She doesn't eat a lot of that candy anymore.

881
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,110
She doesn't eat a lot of that candy anymore.

882
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,810
I still remember...

883
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,810
That moment.

884
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,410
Because I was very little Toki.

885
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,970
But because...

886
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,950
It was a long time ago.

887
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,910
But I still remember that moment.

888
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,090
It's like...

889
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,530
There's like flashbulb memories.

890
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,970
So if you guys don't know.

891
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,670
Flashbulb memory is basically...

892
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,330
A moment that's so traumatic.

893
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:17,930
That you'll always...

894
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,730
You'll be like 90 years old.

895
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,110
And you'll still remember that day.

896
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,650
This is my flashbulb memory.

897
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,790
It is...

898
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,130
My core memory.

899
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,210
So yes.

900
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,990
Little Toki doesn't eat a lot of candy anymore.

901
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,980
Adult Toki...

902
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,610
Also doesn't eat a lot of candy anymore.

903
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,710
Like I mean...

904
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,490
If I do see a White Rabbit candy.

905
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,530
I'll have one.

906
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,190
Yes of course they do.

907
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:45,790
It's famous.

908
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,690
I'll have like one.

909
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,900
Not 5+.

910
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,630
Like I used to.

911
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,630
I'll have like one.

912
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,650
The candy trauma.

913
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,030
The candy trauma.

914
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,330
This is also why I'm more so of a...

915
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,990
Of a chocolate gal now.

916
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:04,370
Of a chocolate gal now.

917
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,130
I only really have chocolate.

918
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,470
Instead of...

919
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,510
Instead of candy.

920
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,670
One is enough for me.

921
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,450
One is enough for me.

922
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:18,690
Yeah.

923
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,490
It just reminds me.

924
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,370
When I used to live in Asia.

925
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,090
People don't celebrate Halloween.

926
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,970
And like...

927
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,730
I had to...

928
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,730
The only place you can go like trick or treating.

929
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,190
Is like...

930
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,190
Okay.

931
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,290
So like...

932
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,190
I used to go to international schools.

933
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,010
Yeah.

934
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,430
So like I told you guys about this.

935
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,070
I used to go...

936
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,830
Also because the other reason why there's no like...

937
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,890
There's no like trick or treating.

938
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,670
Is because...

939
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,550
A lot of...

940
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,650
Houses are expensive.

941
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,090
Like people don't normally live in houses in the city in Asia.

942
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,370
Because like...

943
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,630
I think it's also because there's no actual...

944
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,290
Like there's no suburbia.

945
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,170
Like you don't...

946
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,430
There's no actual suburbia in...

947
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,790
In Asia.

948
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,110
It's just apartments.

949
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,030
It's just mostly just apartment buildings.

950
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,850
And yeah there's not a lot of space in everything.

951
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,210
So it's just like usually there's no room for it.

952
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:19,810
It's just apartments.

953
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,990
If you live in a house in Asia.

954
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,750
You're fucking rich as hell.

955
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,630
Or you live on the...

956
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,490
Countryside.

957
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,390
Because like property is much cheaper there.

958
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,730
Because there's also like usually there's no internet.

959
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:32,830
Uh...

960
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,670
There's no really internet there.

961
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,770
So like property is a lot cheaper.

962
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:39,990
So yeah.

963
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,190
So like if you live in a house.

964
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,190
You're fucking loaded.

965
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,170
You're like an actual millionaire.

966
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,090
So...

967
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:47,990
Yeah.

968
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,930
More like you're living in like...

969
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,910
You live in an area where there's...

970
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,810
It's not really a city.

971
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,270
Um...

972
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,730
Uh... Anyway.

973
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,290
Anyway so there's no Halloween.

974
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,590
There's no trick or treating.

975
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,110
Because there's like...

976
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,210
You can't really trick or treat.

977
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,610
In like apart...

978
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,250
You can't really trick or treat in buildings.

979
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,110
It's just apartments.

980
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,750
So it's really funny.

981
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,610
So I used to go to international school.

982
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,270
Yeah.

983
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,130
So I used to go to international schools.

984
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,790
Um...

985
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,310
They basically...

986
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,470
Uh... So that...

987
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,130
I guess like the Americans don't get culture shock.

988
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,370
Um...

989
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,310
It's so...

990
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,990
When I think about it...

991
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,410
Um...

992
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,910
When you...

993
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,370
Okay.

994
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,410
It's really funny.

995
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,010
But like I went to international school.

996
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,090
And one of them...

997
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,510
They want to make sure like I guess like the Americans...

998
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,970
Don't get culture shock.

999
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,530
Like you know...

1000
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,670
No Halloween and stuff like that.

1001
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,390
Or like...

1002
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,710
They built their own suburbia.

1003
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,190
For the school.

1004
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,810
So like the school...

1005
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,030
Was located in its own...

1006
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,230
Gated community.

1007
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,190
Where it was like...

1008
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,690
Literally like all the majority of the American families...

1009
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,010
Literally like all the majority of the American families...

1010
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,190
Would live there.

1011
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,070
Because it would be like their own suburbia.

1012
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:14,930
Because it would be like their own suburbia.

1013
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,430
Obviously I wasn't living there.

1014
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,810
I was a flirty 30 plus...

1015
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,850
Minute drive.

1016
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,530
I didn't.

1017
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,150
Um...

1018
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,550
Later on they expanded.

1019
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,370
Like the school got bigger and bigger.

1020
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,190
Because they couldn't fit in the gated community.

1021
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,010
So they bought like other buildings.

1022
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,370
The school like used to own a...

1023
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,030
Like it used to own...

1024
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,910
Uh...

1025
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,430
There was a building that was supposed to be a mall.

1026
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,490
And then the school bought it.

1027
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,150
And then it became like the middle school slash high school.

1028
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,610
And they had escalators and shit like that.

1029
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,470
It was fucking crazy.

1030
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,310
And then the school...

1031
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,170
That building they bought for middle slash high school...

1032
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,030
Was not even supposed to be a school.

1033
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,850
So they had like elevators and everything.

1034
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:56,790
Uh...

1035
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,590
Escalators.

1036
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,850
So they had like escalators.

1037
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,130
And they had like escalators and shit.

1038
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,750
Not elevators.

1039
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:03,970
Escalators and stuff.

1040
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,270
Um... But anyway.

1041
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,710
I thought it was really funny.

1042
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,130
Like I thought... I didn't think it was weird back then.

1043
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,190
Because like...

1044
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,410
This was like one of the first international schools I went to.

1045
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,110
I didn't think it was weird.

1046
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,650
Because like you know...

1047
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,170
Little Doki was like...

1048
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,770
Oh yeah it's just like suburbia.

1049
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,310
You know?

1050
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,290
I was like...

1051
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,450
Whoa it's like suburbia.

1052
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,090
Where there's like houses and stuff.

1053
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:30,790
And like...

1054
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,610
Villas and stuff.

1055
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,990
Where like all the Americans.

1056
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,790
So they don't feel weird.

1057
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,410
They don't feel...

1058
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,710
They don't feel like culture shock.

1059
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,390
From living in America.

1060
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:45,770
From living in Asia.

1061
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,830
So basically what's so funny is that like...

1062
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,890
All the students.

1063
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,190
All like the... you know all the students.

1064
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,910
And the kids.

1065
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,830
They would go...

1066
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,110
Yes it was a gated community.

1067
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,910
Because like when you have to enter the school.

1068
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,190
To enter the community.

1069
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,930
You need a special pass.

1070
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,390
To even like drop your kids off.

1071
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,430
Because they're like...

1072
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,410
We don't want kid... you know they don't want kidnappers.

1073
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,690
To come in.

1074
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,410
To like just pick...

1075
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,290
Because it's like there's preschool as well.

1076
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,990
There's preschool too.

1077
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,570
So like they don't want like you know some...

1078
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,690
Because there's like...

1079
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,470
There's some really rich people there.

1080
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,910
Because a lot of people... if you don't know international schools.

1081
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,170
A lot of people that go to like...

1082
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,770
They are like...

1083
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,810
Because like a lot of people that...

1084
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,910
A lot of the adults that...

1085
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,290
You know have to go to like...

1086
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,390
Asia and stuff.

1087
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,410
And put their kids to international school.

1088
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,590
They're usually are working for like...

1089
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,450
Really big companies.

1090
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,570
And their companies sent them to like...

1091
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,650
Certain Asian countries.

1092
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,250
To like expand the company and stuff like that.

1093
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,690
So like you would see like you know...

1094
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,610
Executives, children and stuff.

1095
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,250
Like I had an actual...

1096
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,230
Oh what is it called?

1097
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,410
Like...

1098
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,950
I had...

1099
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,570
An actual...

1100
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,310
Saudi princess.

1101
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,130
That went to one of my international schools.

1102
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,730
Like legitimately.

1103
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,170
She was a Saudi princess.

1104
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,830
I'm not joking.

1105
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,130
I am not joking.

1106
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,050
Like she was like...

1107
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,790
I remember because she was like...

1108
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,990
She was like my senior.

1109
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:22,270
She was like two years...

1110
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,330
Older than me.

1111
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,270
And like...

1112
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,830
We had an event.

1113
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,810
Where it was like...

1114
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,550
Secret Santa.

1115
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,430
We had an event that was like Secret Santa.

1116
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,750
And...

1117
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,950
And everyone was like...

1118
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,050
Oh my god.

1119
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,490
Her hair is my Secret Santa.

1120
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,590
I was like hoping she would be...

1121
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,110
Like their Secret Santa.

1122
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,790
Because like I was like...

1123
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,150
Why does everyone want her to...

1124
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,470
Want her to be like the Secret Santa.

1125
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,750
And people were like...

1126
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,850
Bro she's like fucking loaded.

1127
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:58,930
She bought...

1128
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,990
Okay they won't say fucking.

1129
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,350
But they were like bro she's loaded.

1130
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,530
Like she actually buys the most insane gifts for you.

1131
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,330
If you get her as a Secret Santa.

1132
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,670
I was like...

1133
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,610
Bro like what?

1134
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,050
Yeah one of them was like...

1135
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,750
Yeah bro she got me like...

1136
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,330
A Beats by Dre headphone.

1137
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,250
And like a design...

1138
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,390
I don't know what it was but like...

1139
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,810
She gets like multiple presents.

1140
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,290
For a little oil...

1141
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,850
Yeah she like gives you like...

1142
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,950
Beats by Dre headphones.

1143
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,530
And that was when Beats by Dre was like super popular by the way.

1144
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,470
And was like...

1145
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,870
And it was like...

1146
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,150
And like it's not just that she gets you more than...

1147
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,430
She got me a designer bag.

1148
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,850
And Beats by Dre.

1149
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,910
Like someone was like I got her last year.

1150
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,930
I got a Beats by Dre and a designer bag from her.

1151
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,230
God getting her as a Secret Santa is like jackpot.

1152
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,070
I remember...

1153
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,730
I remember...

1154
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,910
I remember like...

1155
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,970
Talking to her.

1156
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,430
And like her...

1157
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,230
I don't know why.

1158
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,890
I just remember like one point.

1159
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,110
I was like...

1160
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,110
Talking to her.

1161
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,190
And she was like...

1162
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,770
Oh yeah when I graduate...

1163
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,870
Cause like you know she's...

1164
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,970
Literally like a Saudi princess.

1165
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:16,990
Apparently.

1166
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,030
She's like yeah like I have to go...

1167
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,350
I actually have a...

1168
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,110
I actually have a...

1169
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,910
Beyonce.

1170
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,970
And I was really young.

1171
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,410
I was like in middle school.

1172
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,870
And she was like...

1173
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,350
A high schooler.

1174
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,710
So like to me I was like...

1175
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,330
A Beyonce?

1176
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,850
Me thinking back I was like...

1177
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,250
Wow you're gonna get...

1178
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,990
You're gonna get married after you graduate.

1179
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,290
Like I was like...

1180
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,830
I don't know I remember I was super young.

1181
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,610
I was in middle school.

1182
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:51,550
And I was like wow do you know who he is?

1183
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,470
And she was like no.

1184
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,510
And then you know I was young.

1185
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,010
I didn't like think about it.

1186
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,270
And then I was like...

1187
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,510
So that's crazy.

1188
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,630
Anyway as I was saying.

1189
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,330
It was this international school.

1190
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,410
I used to go to cause I went to many international schools.

1191
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,570
Like I traveled a lot.

1192
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,890
Growing up cause I had to move around a lot.

1193
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,090
And...

1194
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,250
And like I remember just like...

1195
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,710
Like to even like enter the gated community.

1196
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:25,790
You need like a pass.

1197
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,150
Because you know people don't want...

1198
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:29,890
To have their child kidnapped.

1199
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,130
Cause we also have like...

1200
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,630
Also I think it's just really bad...

1201
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,310
Poor planning of the...

1202
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,470
Surroundings.

1203
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,710
Because the playground was very near the entrance.

1204
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,770
Where all the little kids play on.

1205
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,410
So like I feel like...

1206
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,550
Maybe it was also like poorly planned.

1207
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:48,990
Because there was...

1208
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,910
The playground was practically almost at the entrance.

1209
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,470
Of the community.

1210
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,690
So yeah you needed like a pass.

1211
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:59,250
To even enter the entrance.

1212
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,470
You needed a pass.

1213
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,690
To even enter the entrance.

1214
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:03,990
And drop your kid.

1215
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,370
So like you need a special pass.

1216
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,790
But yeah for those...

1217
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,110
Like I said for those who don't know.

1218
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,830
That's why I'm saying like a lot of people.

1219
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:16,850
That...

1220
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,050
That usually have...

1221
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:19,950
You know a lot of the...

1222
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,930
Especially like Americans.

1223
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,650
People who don't live in the country.

1224
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,910
The international school is in.

1225
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,790
Usually the parents were...

1226
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,650
Were assigned to work in that country.

1227
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,830
As an expat.

1228
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,290
And they were assigned to work in that country.

1229
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,570
To like help with...

1230
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:36,570
Expansion.

1231
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,990
You know like expanding into a new country.

1232
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,150
For the business.

1233
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:40,990
For the company.

1234
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,270
I remember like...

1235
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,910
One of my schools that I went to.

1236
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:45,750
One of my international schools.

1237
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,910
Was like 60 to 70%...

1238
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,230
Were like Koreans.

1239
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,870
Because...

1240
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,470
At that time...

1241
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,330
Samsung...

1242
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,990
Samsung was expanding their...

1243
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,830
Business.

1244
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,930
In this particular area.

1245
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,910
So they sent a lot of like...

1246
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,290
You know sent a lot of the...

1247
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,010
A lot of Koreans to this particular region.

1248
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,810
And so like...

1249
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,970
You know their kids will go to my school.

1250
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,070
And then like 60 to 70%...

1251
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,690
Of the student body.

1252
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,670
Yeah the Korean execs.

1253
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,790
Will be like...

1254
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,430
Would like attend my school.

1255
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,910
And so that's how I learned Korean.

1256
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:26,810
Because...

1257
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,550
At that time...

1258
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:30,510
I would you know...

1259
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,530
I had a lot of friends.

1260
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:32,550
Korean friends.

1261
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,970
So that's how I learned a lot about like...

1262
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,630
Like Korean culture.

1263
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,450
Like Korean K-pop and all that stuff.

1264
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,610
Like I was like you know...

1265
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,130
Like now it's like BTS.

1266
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,490
But back then I had Girls Generation.

1267
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,850
Super Junior.

1268
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:45,990
Big Band.

1269
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,050
Stuff like that.

1270
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:49,550
Like Big Band was pre BTS.

1271
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,790
Before you guys had BTS.

1272
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,390
Big Band walked for you.

1273
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,090
Big Band and Super Junior.

1274
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,550
Super Junior and Big Band...

1275
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,950
Walked so BTS can run.

1276
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,630
So yeah and 2NE1.

1277
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,870
I love 2NE1.

1278
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,150
I love... I don't remember 2NE1 songs.

1279
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,130
But like I remember like...

1280
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,890
I just love the name.

1281
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,850
I thought it was like such a creative name.

1282
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,430
Ummm...

1283
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1284
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:30,930
Thank you.

1285
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,270
Thank you.

1286
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,330
Doki went to school with actual Ojo songs.

1287
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:34,470
No I did.

1288
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,390
I... One of... Okay so like...

1289
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:40,210
In one of... Okay so in one of my international schools.

1290
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:41,810
There's like...

1291
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:43,930
I'll say... It's so fucked up.

1292
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,650
But like there's like...

1293
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,030
Special tuition.

1294
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:48,790
For the...

1295
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:52,170
For citizens of like whatever region.

1296
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,090
I would... Like whatever country I was in.

1297
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,870
So like umm...

1298
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,710
Cause like international schools have this.

1299
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,750
So like usually international schools.

1300
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,630
Is for international students.

1301
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,050
But...

1302
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,210
They will make exceptions.

1303
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,250
If you're really rich.

1304
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,410
So...

1305
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,050
Like they will... They will make exceptions.

1306
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,890
To like the local...

1307
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,310
Locals in the area.

1308
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,150
If you're really rich.

1309
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,030
They'll have like...

1310
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,410
Jacked up tuition prices.

1311
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,530
Just for like...

1312
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:27,190
Umm...

1313
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,230
Just for like the locals in the area.

1314
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,070
So like if you're international student.

1315
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,570
You would pay like you know...

1316
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,410
1 sixth of that price.

1317
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,330
But like umm...

1318
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,470
Or you could say like if you're a local.

1319
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,790
You would pay the tuition for that for a year.

1320
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,870
Would be like times 6.

1321
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,770
The original price of the tuition.

1322
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,630
So I remember there was a girl in my grade.

1323
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,470
Umm...

1324
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,130
I was in middle school.

1325
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,210
There was a girl... I think... Or like was that in high school?

1326
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,070
I'm trying to remember which school this was.

1327
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,770
But umm...

1328
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:59,070
There was a girl in my school.

1329
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,790
And then I remember everyone was telling me like...

1330
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:02,490
Bro like...

1331
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,350
Cause like we would be like...

1332
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,370
Where are you from?

1333
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,490
And then the girl would be like...

1334
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,710
Oh I'm here from here.

1335
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,090
Cause we would do like icebreakers being like...

1336
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:11,730
Cause we're all international...

1337
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,310
We're all like quote on quote international students.

1338
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,970
From different countries.

1339
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,110
So we would do like icebreakers being like...

1340
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,750
Oh where are you guys from?

1341
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:21,890
Like as your icebreaker.

1342
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,770
Like oh I'm from Ireland.

1343
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,370
Or like oh I'm from South Africa.

1344
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,050
Stuff like that.

1345
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,090
And then she would be like I'm from here.

1346
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:32,710
So you know we all thought it was weird.

1347
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:38,570
Hahahaha Hahahaha We were like...

1348
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:40,690
What do you mean here?

1349
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:45,990
Hahahaha This is an international school.

1350
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,650
What do you mean you're from here?

1351
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,110
Hahahaha Hahahaha And then...

1352
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,970
I remember I was just like...

1353
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:56,910
That's weird.

1354
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,870
I remember I was like...

1355
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,570
That's weird.

1356
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,490
This is an international school.

1357
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:08,210
Hahahaha Hahahaha Um...

1358
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,230
And then I remember cause like...

1359
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:11,450
She was...

1360
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,070
She was fucking loaded.

1361
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:15,690
She was...

1362
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,210
Okay.

1363
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,170
I don't know if this was like based off of like...

1364
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,370
How rich she was.

1365
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,630
But like...

1366
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,590
Whenever we would have school trips.

1367
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,890
Or like trips where like obviously...

1368
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,070
Like the places we're going.

1369
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:32,730
It's like not a great like you know...

1370
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,990
Like maybe we were going to travel somewhere that was like...

1371
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,370
Community service or something.

1372
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,230
We had to do like community service and like...

1373
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,250
Um...

1374
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:42,970
We had to like...

1375
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:43,970
Like we had to like you know...

1376
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,450
Take a plane ride to a certain area.

1377
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,830
And we'd do community service or stuff like that.

1378
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,510
She would...

1379
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:56,070
Hahahaha Hahahaha She...

1380
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,470
I don't know how...

1381
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:58,210
But like...

1382
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,590
She would get like a permission slip.

1383
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,830
Being like...

1384
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,810
Oh I can't go.

1385
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,430
I'm sick.

1386
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,010
Hahahaha

1387
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,730
She would... like...

1388
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,670
Doing community service.

1389
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,790
I was like...

1390
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,910
Hahahaha She would literally be like...

1391
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:19,830
Oh I can't go.

1392
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:20,650
I'm sick.

1393
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,270
So like she would actually get like a...

1394
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,650
A note from...

1395
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,230
Whatever maybe like the doctors or something.

1396
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,190
Being like...

1397
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,390
She can't do community service or like travel that far.

1398
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,090
Because she's sick.

1399
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,590
And then she was obviously not sick.

1400
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,510
Cause she would go to school.

1401
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,830
To give the slip.

1402
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,790
To the teacher.

1403
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,110
Hahahaha She would come to school.

1404
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,210
To like give the slip to the teacher.

1405
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,870
And just cause we all have to show up at school.

1406
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,310
To take the bus.

1407
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,890
To take the bus.

1408
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,150
Or like take the shuttle bus.

1409
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,090
To the airport.

1410
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:03,970
Hahahaha Hahahaha And then I remember one time I was actually sick.

1411
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,210
Um...

1412
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,610
One time like I was actually sick.

1413
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,370
And I had to like...

1414
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,110
And the thing is.

1415
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,070
It's not like you just...

1416
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,050
You don't go to school.

1417
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,470
Uh... You don't go to school.

1418
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,630
If you're like...

1419
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,690
If you're like...

1420
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:19,610
Sick, sick thing.

1421
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,270
If you're not gonna go do the trip.

1422
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,890
You still have to go to school.

1423
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,010
And do like class work.

1424
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,730
Because like it's technically a school event.

1425
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,990
So...

1426
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,750
I think I was sick.

1427
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,630
I think like I twisted my ankle or something.

1428
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,890
So I still had to go to school.

1429
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,610
I couldn't participate in one of the community service trips.

1430
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,730
So I had to...

1431
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,550
I actually...

1432
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,070
I actually like twisted my ankle from like one of the sports I did.

1433
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,150
Sports I did.

1434
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,970
And so but I still had to like show up at school.

1435
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,990
Because I couldn't do the community service thing.

1436
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,230
So I had to do class work.

1437
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,950
And then like I see her.

1438
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,550
I see her there.

1439
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,290
You know?

1440
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,670
And we all had laptops too.

1441
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:01,850
So like when we were doing class work.

1442
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,090
Because like it was me, her and this other girl.

1443
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,250
And I would like do class work and stuff.

1444
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,590
And then I look over.

1445
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,270
Because we all had to sit together.

1446
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,010
And I look over to my side.

1447
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,490
And I see her looking at like buying...

1448
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:15,150
Shopping.

1449
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,230
I see her like online shopping.

1450
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,750
And watching YouTube videos.

1451
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,510
She does not...

1452
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,890
I call bullshit.

1453
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,350
I call BS.

1454
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,470
She was not sick.

1455
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,510
She was not sick.

1456
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,870
I know being sick doesn't prevent you from browsing the internet.

1457
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:38,590
But...

1458
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,770
There is no way she was sick.

1459
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,110
Every time.

1460
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,830
Every time we had community service.

1461
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,890
There is no fucking way.

1462
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:48,590
She was...

1463
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,050
There is no fucking way.

1464
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,890
Every time we had community service.

1465
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,750
She was fucking sick.

1466
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,810
I refuse to believe it.

1467
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,890
Oh my god.

1468
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:06,690
But yeah.

1469
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,110
That...

1470
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:09,090
I...

1471
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,810
I just...

1472
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:13,370
That was like such a memory for me.

1473
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,110
Oh yeah.

1474
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:14,910
And then...

1475
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,450
It won't be just one international school.

1476
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:18,650
There was like...

1477
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:21,250
Another international school.

1478
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,270
Okay.

1479
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,670
It's so fucked up.

1480
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,010
Okay.

1481
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,690
It's actually like...

1482
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,150
Really fucked up for me to say.

1483
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,530
But we had a rivals...

1484
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,650
There was a rival international school.

1485
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,690
We had a rival international school.

1486
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,770
But our school...

1487
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:42,990
Was the more expensive.

1488
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,440
Our school...

1489
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,740
Was the better performing one.

1490
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,260
The tuition...

1491
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,660
Was more expensive.

1492
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,280
And our students...

1493
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,340
Performed better.

1494
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,940
We performed a lot better.

1495
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,400
So we had a...

1496
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,520
We would do like...

1497
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:10,240
You know, we would have like rival... the rival events and stuff.

1498
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,460
So like also like to get in...

1499
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:21,780
there's also like... I know like... it's also like a bit more... I think like I don't know how I...

1500
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,680
oh wait, I'm trying to remember how I got in.

1501
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,440
But like you had to take like tests and stuff too.

1502
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,520
So like if you failed the entrance exam for my school or you have the money...

1503
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,400
because I know... I know there's... I know damn well some of them...

1504
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,120
there was no way they would pass the entrance exam.

1505
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,940
I don't...

1506
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:49,000
I know there's some people in my school there's no way they would pass the entrance exam.

1507
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,100
They were loaded.

1508
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,000
Anyway...

1509
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:58,960
Anyway...

1510
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,220
Um...

1511
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,040
Um...

1512
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:04,280
Anyway, as I was saying...

1513
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:05,350
Um...

1514
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,340
Uh...

1515
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:11,680
So there was the rival school and the rival international school.

1516
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,300
And like we had... there was like a huge rivalry between us two.

1517
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,060
Because you know they're... they're... they're like not that even far.

1518
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:25,080
The funny thing is that when we have like practices like...

1519
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,700
Uh...

1520
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,420
Like...

1521
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,820
Like sport practices like...

1522
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,420
Like soccer or like soccer practices.

1523
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,040
There's only...

1524
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,560
I think there's... there's like only one field.

1525
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,660
There's only like one giant field.

1526
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,080
And like... and it's so funny because...

1527
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,320
And but there's like three... there's like three fields.

1528
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,340
So...

1529
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:52,700
So sometimes we would fight over which school gets to use the field to...

1530
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,420
Which school gets to use the field for like soccer practice.

1531
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,500
And we would be like...

1532
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,920
Oh... there...

1533
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,220
When we get to the...

1534
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,040
When we would get to like the field and we see them...

1535
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,340
I obviously I don't want to dox anybody.

1536
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:04,960
So I'll be like...

1537
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,960
Oh there they are.

1538
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,000
There's that school.

1539
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,760
We'll be like...

1540
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,680
Oh my god there they are.

1541
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,720
Like actual school rivalry and shit.

1542
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:22,720
And...

1543
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,000
And we'll be...

1544
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,340
Oh and then we would be like...

1545
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:26,780
Come...

1546
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,440
And then I remember...

1547
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,300
I remember we'll be like...

1548
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,060
At least we're not...

1549
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,260
I'm gonna try to make a name.

1550
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:31,960
Okay...

1551
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,000
At least...

1552
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,080
I'm gonna make up like letters.

1553
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,360
I'll be like...

1554
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,920
At least we're not...

1555
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,820
Y.O.T.

1556
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,120
Stuff like that.

1557
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,780
We'll be like...

1558
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,760
Oh my god.

1559
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,700
Like I can't believe this is happening to us.

1560
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,660
But at least we don't go to Y.O.T.

1561
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,560
Because we're all...

1562
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,740
We were so pretentious.

1563
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,000
Holy shit.

1564
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,180
We were so pretentious.

1565
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,380
Because we always were like...

1566
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,760
Our school is better.

1567
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,600
Because...

1568
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,780
Because we'll be like...

1569
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,280
Oh my god.

1570
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,240
At least we're not Y.O.T.

1571
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,560
And at least we like...

1572
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,220
We have better facilities.

1573
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,400
And then...

1574
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,160
And then you know the other school would be like...

1575
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,000
Oh my god.

1576
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,140
At least we're not like...

1577
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:19,460
Them.

1578
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,920
They're so fucking pretentious.

1579
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,620
We had...

1580
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,360
We had...

1581
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,380
There was like one...

1582
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,520
One person...

1583
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,320
In...

1584
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:26,600
In...

1585
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,360
In...

1586
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,120
In...

1587
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,760
Not me.

1588
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,820
I wouldn't say it.

1589
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,640
But like these are like the things I'd hear.

1590
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,720
Like the things I hear and stuff.

1591
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:34,840
Um...

1592
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,680
And...

1593
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:37,420
Um...

1594
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,080
Cause like okay.

1595
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,040
It's really...

1596
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,500
Uh...

1597
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,580
When I did like sports.

1598
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,500
When I did like...

1599
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,880
Varsity sports.

1600
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,860
I was...

1601
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,760
One of the only players in my team.

1602
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,180
That would befriend other players in different schools.

1603
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,180
So like I would like hang...

1604
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,240
I would actually like...

1605
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,280
Befriend like other players.

1606
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,240
In like...

1607
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:56,760
Uh...

1608
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,000
Different schools and stuff.

1609
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,200
So I had like...

1610
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,120
I would just hang...

1611
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,780
Cause I don't know.

1612
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,200
It was fun.

1613
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:01,780
It was fun.

1614
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,720
Cause it was like...

1615
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,200
Um...

1616
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,180
An international school.

1617
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,840
So I can meet people from different countries.

1618
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,480
And I remember like...

1619
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,420
When I was like...

1620
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:08,900
I did soccer.

1621
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,040
Um...

1622
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,880
I would always hang out.

1623
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,500
I would um...

1624
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,380
Befriend like some of the really good players.

1625
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,400
Uh...

1626
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,520
From different schools.

1627
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,500
Same with volleyball.

1628
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,640
Uh...

1629
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,160
And stuff.

1630
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,400
And I would befriend like the players from different schools and hang out with them.

1631
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:24,300
Usually...

1632
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:24,860
Uh...

1633
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,220
I was a little bit of an outsider.

1634
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,680
In my teams.

1635
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,240
Because I usually...

1636
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,000
Uh...

1637
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,500
Usually I wouldn't hang out with my team all the time.

1638
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,200
And I would hang out with like...

1639
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:34,560
Uh...

1640
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,420
The other players in different teams.

1641
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:37,820
Um...

1642
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,840
And...

1643
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,700
Oh my god!

1644
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,820
I remember...

1645
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,260
Uh...

1646
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,020
I was like hanging out with one of the rival teams.

1647
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,180
Because they had a really really good player.

1648
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,820
Back then in one of the...

1649
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,560
One of the...

1650
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,620
In soccer in one of my schools.

1651
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,800
I was known as like one of the best...

1652
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,360
Goalies.

1653
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,540
In our division.

1654
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,920
So like out of all the schools.

1655
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,980
I was like the best goalkeeper.

1656
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,140
Um...

1657
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,860
Versus like all the schools during like...

1658
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,940
Because like we would have like tournaments and stuff with a lot of international schools.

1659
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,820
From like different countries.

1660
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,080
Um...

1661
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,640
So like in one...

1662
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,520
One time I was like the best goalkeeper.

1663
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:19,020
In like in the division for like all the schools combined.

1664
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,460
Um...

1665
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:21,860
But...

1666
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,220
But there was like this one girl.

1667
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,680
Who was an insane...

1668
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,540
Striker.

1669
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,340
Like she was like the best.

1670
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,480
Um...

1671
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,620
She was like the best striker.

1672
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,580
Out of all the schools.

1673
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,160
She was the best striker.

1674
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,420
And I befriended her.

1675
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,660
Because you know I was like...

1676
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,200
Bro she's so fucking good.

1677
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,600
And then we would like every time we meet up.

1678
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,600
Um...

1679
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,540
Because she goes from a different school.

1680
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,520
Like she obviously...

1681
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,940
She goes to international school in a different country.

1682
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,000
Uh...

1683
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,720
So like every time we meet up in like a tournament.

1684
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,280
Like um...

1685
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,840
We would like practice against each other.

1686
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,940
And stuff.

1687
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,600
Because like you know if I practice against the best.

1688
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,940
I can perform better against the other strikers.

1689
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:01,880
Because she was known...

1690
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,400
She literally got like a...

1691
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,980
She literally got a soccer scholarship.

1692
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,340
Uh for university.

1693
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,060
Like because I like kept in touch with her for a bit.

1694
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,460
But I don't talk like after you know after uh university.

1695
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,580
Like obviously like you don't really keep in touch with a lot of people.

1696
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,940
But like she she's so good that she got scouted overseas.

1697
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,020
That's how good she was.

1698
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,600
Like like usually scouting.

1699
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,400
What happened you know in the in in the country.

1700
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,460
But she literally got scouted overseas for a soccer scholarship.

1701
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,660
That's how insane she was as a striker.

1702
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,200
And like her entire family were like was obsessed with soccer.

1703
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,420
Because like I would...

1704
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,860
I think I was at the school for like two to three years.

1705
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,520
So um a year passed.

1706
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,480
And then her little sister uh was in the division.

1707
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,680
And she was also a goalkeeper.

1708
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,080
And I became friends with her too.

1709
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,520
Because uh...

1710
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,500
uh...

1711
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:55,700
uh...

1712
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,920
because uh you know I was like oh you're her sister.

1713
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,980
And then you're also a goalkeeper.

1714
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,560
So then we would like I would give her like tips and advice.

1715
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,400
On like being a goalkeeper and stuff like that.

1716
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,920
Like uh so like uh like her entire family was just really talented at soccer.

1717
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:16,580
Um I remember it was a crazy moment.

1718
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,160
She kicked me in the head the striker.

1719
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,600
Because we were like we were facing them.

1720
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,000
So...

1721
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,140
hahaha and uh...

1722
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,360
um...

1723
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,060
um...

1724
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,040
that's where I lost a bit of my brain cells.

1725
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,260
But um...

1726
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:33,640
you know like obviously I had like I like protected my head.

1727
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,340
Because like I dived over and like grabbed the ball and like huddled around it.

1728
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,240
Um...

1729
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:39,840
because I...

1730
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,800
I aggressed her.

1731
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,500
I pushed her.

1732
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,500
Um...

1733
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,880
like it was a huge gamble and I pushed her.

1734
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,500
I aggressed her.

1735
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,480
And then like I...

1736
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,860
I like covered my head with my arms and stuff.

1737
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,760
But she still like hit me.

1738
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:51,960
hahaha...

1739
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:52,760
hahaha...

1740
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,200
hahaha...

1741
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:54,300
hahaha...

1742
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,520
I kept playing.

1743
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:58,300
hahaha...

1744
01:01:59,100 --> 01:01:59,540
hahaha...

1745
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:01,480
um...

1746
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,640
um...

1747
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,480
But yeah no I usually um...

1748
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,000
I like hang out with the...

1749
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,780
uh...

1750
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,660
I hang out with...

1751
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,300
like I said I usually just hang out...

1752
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,820
yeah yeah she was like oh my gosh I'm so sorry like...

1753
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:13,600
uh...

1754
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,100
you like...

1755
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,360
like I said I usually hang out with like the players from the rival teams.

1756
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,100
Because I thought it was like...

1757
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,100
I thought it was cool.

1758
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:20,980
I thought...

1759
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,820
it was fun hanging out with like people.

1760
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:23,940
I don't normally like...

1761
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,400
talk like I don't like...

1762
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,820
I have a rare chance to meet up with and stuff like that.

1763
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,240
And um...

1764
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,300
and it was like a fun moment being able to meet like with people from...

1765
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,140
uh...

1766
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,960
with people from like different countries and stuff.

1767
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:39,920
Um...

1768
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:41,900
Let's see.

1769
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,560
I'm trying to like remember...

1770
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,380
uh...

1771
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:45,820
Fuck.

1772
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,160
It was like...

1773
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,680
How did I get to this part of the story?

1774
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:50,680
Oh yeah yeah yeah!

1775
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,200
Anyway about rival schools.

1776
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,100
So like one time...

1777
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,940
one time there was uh...

1778
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,760
there was a guy in our class um...

1779
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,560
who left our our school to go to the rival school.

1780
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,620
Because uh...

1781
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:11,660
because like he he was he was like...

1782
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,680
well um...

1783
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:17,780
because we had a teacher there that like I guess like made fun of him too much.

1784
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:18,520
uh...

1785
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,100
Because he was like the class clown.

1786
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,180
He was the class cat clown in our class.

1787
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,000
And I think he he didn't really like when he didn't like one of the teachers.

1788
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,860
He really hated one of the teachers.

1789
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:28,980
Which is understandable.

1790
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:29,600
We all...

1791
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,380
We had a teacher that everybody hated.

1792
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,400
We hated her.

1793
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,260
And she was like our math teacher.

1794
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,380
And the thing is like nobody liked her.

1795
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,700
Nobody liked her.

1796
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,660
She was our math teacher.

1797
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,720
Nobody liked her.

1798
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:46,100
But thing is her husband is also a math teacher as well.

1799
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:46,960
Um...

1800
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,600
But we all love the husbands...

1801
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,440
the husband.

1802
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,560
Um...

1803
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,180
Because he was a really good teacher.

1804
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,100
But the...

1805
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,980
But the other teacher we hated her.

1806
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:56,500
Hahaha.

1807
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,280
Anyway...

1808
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:58,680
One...

1809
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,200
Alright...

1810
01:03:59,200 --> 01:03:59,660
One of the...

1811
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:00,380
are the...

1812
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:00,900
The...

1813
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,000
The guys in...

1814
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,480
The guy in our class really hated the...

1815
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:05,960
Um...

1816
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:06,740
The...

1817
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,560
The math teacher.

1818
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,200
The...

1819
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:08,720
The real...

1820
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,260
The wife...

1821
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,500
Really hated the wife.

1822
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,020
But she was like really mean.

1823
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,540
She was so mean.

1824
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:15,520
Um...

1825
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,520
And she graded really harshly.

1826
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,380
Hahaha.

1827
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:19,700
Hahaha.

1828
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,160
And then...

1829
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,780
At one point, sometimes the teacher would follow the grade.

1830
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,220
Like get a promotion.

1831
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:32,300
They would get a promotion and we would have to see them again the year after.

1832
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:43,000
So when he found out that she's gonna follow us, like she's gonna be the teacher for the grade above, he left our school and went to the rival school.

1833
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,100
And I remember our class feeling so betrayed.

1834
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,200
We'll be like, I can't believe he went to UOT.

1835
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:03,180
I'll be like, oh my god, he's a UOT student now.

1836
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:08,360
He's okay, like I'm gonna make up a mascot because we also have like school mascots.

1837
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,860
And he's like, he's a fucking tiger now.

1838
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:23,420
I'm just like remembering that part of my life.

1839
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,840
And I was like, holy shit.

1840
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,380
Oh, okay, I can talk about this without really like doxing anybody.

1841
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:40,460
So like, you know, like I said, I would go to international schools around the world.

1842
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,220
Not around the world, sorry, around Asia.

1843
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,680
Sorry, around Asia.

1844
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,080
But obviously at one point, I was like, oh my god.

1845
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,600
I went to an international school.

1846
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:54,880
I went to and I used to live in Hong Kong.

1847
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:03,440
And one of my fav... and like during like the tournament circuit, there was one school that I loved seeing.

1848
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:12,280
This was like one of my favorite schools that I loved seeing when facing during tournaments.

1849
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,080
And like I was so happy.

1850
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:23,360
I was so like whenever like whenever this school hosted tournaments, I loved that school because I just...

1851
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,400
And it was... I don't remember the name.

1852
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:30,960
But like this international school is like well known in Hong Kong.

1853
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,500
And it's primarily Australians.

1854
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:41,740
It's literally an international school just for Australians.

1855
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,240
And it was so cool.

1856
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,840
It was actually...

1857
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,240
It was so cool.

1858
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,320
And...

1859
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:50,920
Yeah.

1860
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:55,900
And then like I remember because like every time they would do a school cheer, they would be like...

1861
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:56,800
Asi, asi, asi.

1862
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,880
Oi, oi, oi.

1863
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,560
And then I would do their cheer.

1864
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,840
And that shit was so cool.

1865
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,740
It was like asi, oi, asi, oi.

1866
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,000
Asi, asi, asi.

1867
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,180
Oi, oi, oi.

1868
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:09,980
Every time.

1869
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,840
I fucking loved that shit.

1870
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,440
I would like cheer with them because it was such a good cheer.

1871
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,640
So...

1872
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,780
And I like...

1873
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,080
That shit was so fire.

1874
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,380
I loved like...

1875
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,500
I loved like...

1876
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,300
I loved like...

1877
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,020
Just like competing against them or competing...

1878
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,600
Like going to their school whenever like they hosted tournaments and stuff.

1879
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,280
Because it was...

1880
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:45,420
I wish I could do that every time.

1881
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,120
I just... I don't know, it was just so fun!

1882
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,760
Like, Australians are so fucking fun!

1883
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:50,560
Like...

1884
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,100
I like how someone's like, Every international private school...

1885
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:57,280
Wait!

1886
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:58,980
I like them!

1887
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,080
I thought they were funny!

1888
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,960
I thought they...

1889
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,360
I thought the sports teams were funny!

1890
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:11,640
Okay, maybe like the regular students might have been like... might have been too much.

1891
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:15,060
But the sports team students were funny though!

1892
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,180
But yeah...

1893
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,580
I like them!

1894
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:35,160
But yes, there was an international school in Hong Kong that was just Australians.

1895
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,540
And it was like, you know, obviously like kangaroos and stuff like that.

1896
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,500
Like their entire mascots were...

1897
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:43,800
Kangaroos and stuff.

1898
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,320
And yeah, they were pretty...

1899
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,760
I thought they were pretty cool!

1900
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,740
I thought the sports teams were pretty cool!

1901
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,300
Guys, I thought...

1902
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:58,380
I don't know the regular students, but the athletes there were...

1903
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,960
were fun!

1904
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,940
They were fun to hang out with!

1905
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:02,980
I hanged out with them!

1906
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,560
They had the worst...

1907
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,060
...kids!

1908
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,200
But the...

1909
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:14,680
Bro!

1910
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,360
I hung out with the sports team though!

1911
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:19,820
They were so fun!

1912
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,920
They were so fun!

1913
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,640
I don't know about the regular students!

1914
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:34,940
...

1915
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:37,810
...

1916
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:38,300
...

1917
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,560
But yeah...

1918
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,280
But yeah...

1919
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,280
I don't know.

1920
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,800
International school is so different.

1921
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,720
I mean, I went from like a private...

1922
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,500
Catholic school...

1923
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,500
to like...

1924
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,600
a private Catholic school in Canada.

1925
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,160
And then like I had to obviously move out of Canada and do international schools around Asia.

1926
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:01,260
So...

1927
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,680
So...

1928
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,400
So like...

1929
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,280
I never had like a regular school experience.

1930
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:08,960
I think.

1931
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,180
Umm...

1932
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,280
I never really had like a regular...

1933
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:13,480
Oh yeah!

1934
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:17,180
I was like one of the few students there that was not Catholic.

1935
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:17,880
Or Christian.

1936
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,360
I don't know!

1937
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,680
I don't know the difference between Christian and Catholic.

1938
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,080
Umm...

1939
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,200
I don't know the difference between Christian or Catholic.

1940
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,760
I either went to a private Catholic school or a private Christian school.

1941
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,740
I don't remember.

1942
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,360
Maybe Catholic.

1943
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,600
Catholic sounds like something I said a lot.

1944
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:32,840
Umm...

1945
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:34,600
But...

1946
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,200
Umm...

1947
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:36,680
Umm...

1948
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,740
But like...

1949
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:40,440
So like in Canada I used to go to like a private Catholic school.

1950
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:41,300
Umm...

1951
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,040
But I was like one of the few students that was not Catholic.

1952
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,180
Or like baptized.

1953
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,920
So like I was excluded.

1954
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:51,000
I was excluded with like religious events.

1955
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,960
I told this story before.

1956
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,240
But like...

1957
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,380
Umm...

1958
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,560
There would be like...

1959
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:57,940
Like...

1960
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,000
Religious events and stuff.

1961
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,660
Where you have to be baptized to participate.

1962
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,240
So if you're not baptized...

1963
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,140
You have to do school work.

1964
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,820
You have to be like locked in the...

1965
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,080
Not locked in a classroom.

1966
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:14,740
But like all the unbaptized kids would be like kept in the classroom.

1967
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,040
To do school...

1968
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:16,700
Classwork.

1969
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:17,960
And then...

1970
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,680
And then I would get so jealous.

1971
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,520
Cause I would be like...

1972
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,400
I wanna...

1973
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,120
Cause then...

1974
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,860
And we also couldn't go to confession.

1975
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,080
And I thought...

1976
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,120
I was really young.

1977
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:28,580
You know?

1978
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,160
Cause I was like in primary school.

1979
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,820
So then I was like...

1980
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:32,840
It's not fair.

1981
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,420
I wanna go to confession too.

1982
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,140
With everybody.

1983
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,040
I remember...

1984
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:41,920
I'd be like...

1985
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,720
I wanna go to confession too.

1986
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,770
Cause I didn't know what was going on.

1987
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:54,710
I didn't know what was going on.

1988
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:55,770
I was just like...

1989
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,350
It's not fair.

1990
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,870
Why did they get to do stuff?

1991
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,250
And I had to be locked in...

1992
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,630
I had to be in the classroom to do classwork.

1993
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:06,590
And then...

1994
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:07,270
So like...

1995
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:08,270
And then we would have like...

1996
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:08,870
Friday night.

1997
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:09,150
Friday mass.

1998
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:10,630
Um...

1999
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:12,670
We would have...

2000
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:13,630
Friday mass.

2001
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:14,430
You know?

2002
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:15,630
And then...

2003
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:16,830
Like every...

2004
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,150
Before we start the day.

2005
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,290
And then obviously you're baptized.

2006
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:23,710
You can go in the front and eat bread from the...

2007
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:26,550
The Pope will give you like some fucking circular bread thing.

2008
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:27,410
Are those bread?

2009
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:28,010
I don't know.

2010
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:29,110
I never got to try it.

2011
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:30,850
Because I was not baptized.

2012
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:31,890
So...

2013
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:35,010
So you know how they handle those circular things you get to eat?

2014
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:35,930
So they're like...

2015
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:38,410
All the baptized students get to lie.

2016
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:38,850
And then...

2017
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:39,330
You get to line up...

2018
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:39,830
And...

2019
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:43,010
Get to line up...

2020
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:45,610
And you get to eat that little special...

2021
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:46,290
Like...

2022
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:47,430
Circular...

2023
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:48,290
Communion...

2024
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:48,490
Oh...

2025
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:49,610
Communion wafers...

2026
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:51,310
And obviously I wasn't baptized.

2027
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,570
So I didn't get to line up.

2028
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:53,470
And I'll be like...

2029
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:54,410
It's not fair!

2030
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,310
Why am I not baptized?

2031
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:58,870
They all get to eat those cool...

2032
01:12:58,870 --> 01:12:59,890
They look so cool.

2033
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:03,490
But I felt so excluded.

2034
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:06,070
I felt so fucking excluded.

2035
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:08,730
I'll be like...

2036
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:08,830
What am I not baptized?

2037
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,890
Stop being... why don't I get to...

2038
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:15,390
Why don't I get to...

2039
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:16,730
Yeah, I had FOMO.

2040
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,830
I had FOMO as a child.

2041
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,490
That's how fucked up it was.

2042
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,230
I'll be like, what does it taste like?

2043
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:30,570
Why do they... stop being... I don't get to line up for it like they do.

2044
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:35,710
And then obviously, you know, I'm not Catholic.

2045
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,290
My family's not religious.

2046
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:38,570
So...

2047
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:43,270
We would have... I don't remember what the religious event was.

2048
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:47,830
And... yeah, I got FOMO'd from not getting the circle bread.

2049
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:53,130
So... and I remember because you know how like those like... what are those beads called?

2050
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:53,830
The...

2051
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:55,530
The rosemary's?

2052
01:13:55,830 --> 01:14:02,530
And then obviously like all the students who are like actually religious, they will have their very own rosemary's.

2053
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,590
And stuff... and... oh, rosary.

2054
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:06,390
Sorry, rosaries.

2055
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:06,950
Sorry.

2056
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:08,550
Rosaries.

2057
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:10,010
They would have the rosary beads.

2058
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:14,530
Um... and then... and then... I didn't... I didn't know!

2059
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,450
I didn't get to try it!

2060
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:19,590
I just saw everybody lining up and getting it every Friday!

2061
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:21,490
So I got FOMO'd!

2062
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:24,190
So anyway, the rosary beads.

2063
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:29,930
And like obviously, like since you're not baptized, you don't have the pretty rosary beads.

2064
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:32,630
So they give us the plastic blue ones.

2065
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:38,170
So like, uh, we all... the unbaptized sinners will get...

2066
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:38,830
Not baptized!

2067
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:39,590
Unbelievers!

2068
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,710
Get the plastic blue rosary's.

2069
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:49,290
And then my friends surrounding me, they would get like the really pretty custom ones because...

2070
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:50,370
Uh, they...

2071
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:55,830
Yeah, why does everyone have the pretty necklace but not me?

2072
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:02,010
I felt so ashamed.

2073
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:07,250
It's actually crazy going to like this Catholic school.

2074
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,470
I felt so ashamed.

2075
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:09,870
I was like, why am I so ashamed of not being Catholic?

2076
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:16,430
It's like, I felt like... I'd be like, why don't I get all this?

2077
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,570
And I remember one time, I'd be like, Mom!

2078
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:20,270
I wanna get baptized!

2079
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:21,030
Mom!

2080
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:27,810
I remember one time I like asked my mom that I wanna get baptized because I wanted to eat the...

2081
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,950
I really wanted to go to confession!

2082
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:35,190
I didn't know what was actually going on!

2083
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:39,910
I had no idea what was actually going on!

2084
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:42,410
I just felt like I just had FOMO'd.

2085
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,830
The fear... I got left out!

2086
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:47,690
So like, I was just like, I wanna be... I was like, it's not fair!

2087
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:49,170
I wanna go to confession!

2088
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,110
I don't know what the fuck confession was!

2089
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,670
I just wanted to go!

2090
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,810
I just wanted to go!

2091
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,110
That's how they get you the FOMO!

2092
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,890
That's how they get you the FOMO!

2093
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:06,230
Yes, I almost got baptized because of FOMO.

2094
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:08,470
But then my mom was like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

2095
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,550
But then my mom was like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

2096
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,250
You're not getting baptized because you're a FOMO!

2097
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:14,110
Because you're scared of being left out!

2098
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,310
It doesn't mean...

2099
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:17,490
You really wanna get baptized!

2100
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:19,670
It has to be an actual choice from you!

2101
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:21,330
Not because of FOMO!

2102
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:24,790
It was...

2103
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:28,210
Obviously I didn't know what the fuck was going on!

2104
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,790
Michael, thank you for the super chat!

2105
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:37,190
Thank you!

2106
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,190
Damn, I'm baptized!

2107
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:39,910
Kids, leave me alone!

2108
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,590
What the fuck!

2109
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:42,710
Thank you for the super chat!

2110
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:43,250
Thank you!

2111
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:46,350
Yeah, I had to...

2112
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:49,150
I didn't get baptized for the right reasons!

2113
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,910
Not because of FOMO!

2114
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,910
Not because I was...

2115
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:54,810
I felt...

2116
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:58,390
I felt sad of being left out!

2117
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,090
Because I didn't get the special wafers!

2118
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:09,330
Super thank you for the super chat!

2119
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:10,150
Thank you!

2120
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:14,390
As a catholic myself, I apologize on behalf of him for such discrimination!

2121
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,170
FOMO!

2122
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,650
Thank you for the super chat!

2123
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:18,010
Thank you!

2124
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:19,290
Oh yeah!

2125
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:22,590
What was funny is that the catholic school...

2126
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:26,510
The private catholic school I went to was super competitive to get in!

2127
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:28,990
But I literally got in via nepotism!

2128
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:30,610
I think I told this story before!

2129
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:33,930
But I literally got in because...

2130
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:34,290
Um...

2131
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:36,870
One of my cousins...

2132
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:38,950
I think like one of my cousins...

2133
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:39,490
Or...

2134
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:41,030
Or like...

2135
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,150
Yeah, one of my...

2136
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:46,890
My mom's friends, kids, or cousins or whatever...

2137
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,090
She used to go to this school.

2138
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:51,410
And she was like straight A student.

2139
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,830
Like one of their best performing students.

2140
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,410
So then they were like...

2141
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:55,810
Wait!

2142
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:57,570
Dokia is related to her?

2143
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:58,590
Oh my god!

2144
01:17:58,670 --> 01:17:59,150
That's alright!

2145
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:00,050
You don't have to take the test!

2146
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:06,650
They thought...

2147
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:09,770
They thought I was gonna be the next her!

2148
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:12,930
They were like...

2149
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,090
She doesn't need to take the test!

2150
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:14,590
She's in!

2151
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:17,970
Because it was super competitive and you have to take a test and everything.

2152
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,970
But because I was related to her and she was one of their best students...

2153
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:22,330
I didn't need to take a test!

2154
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:24,450
Instead, when I got in...

2155
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,370
After like...

2156
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:26,470
I think...

2157
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:29,290
That was a mistake for them!

2158
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:32,370
Because in like 2-3 years...

2159
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:34,030
They put me in an ESL class!

2160
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,990
By the way...

2161
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,050
English was my first language!

2162
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,490
But in 2-3 years...

2163
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,250
I got put in an ESL class!

2164
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:48,230
Because...

2165
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:50,010
Because I was so stupid!

2166
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:51,870
I didn't understand the concept of...

2167
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:52,310
Okay!

2168
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:54,090
The main reason...

2169
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:56,830
Why I got put in an ESL class...

2170
01:18:56,830 --> 01:19:01,190
Is because I didn't understand the concept of paragraphs!

2171
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:02,330
And...

2172
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:03,110
And...

2173
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,150
And...

2174
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:04,010
And...

2175
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:04,490
And...

2176
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,890
The reason being...

2177
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:10,330
Is that I took the instructions so literally!

2178
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:11,710
So...

2179
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:13,070
I was like...

2180
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:16,910
The one person that actually got kicked out of ESL class!

2181
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:17,990
After like 2 years!

2182
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:19,610
They kicked me out of ESL class!

2183
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:20,130
Because they were like...

2184
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:20,290
Wait!

2185
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,210
You're not actually ESL!

2186
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,650
You don't have to go to this anymore!

2187
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:27,790
So basically, what happened was that...

2188
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:30,250
We were told...

2189
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:30,950
That...

2190
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:32,370
Paragraphs...

2191
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:35,130
They have to be...

2192
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:36,490
If you want to make a paragraph...

2193
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:40,330
You have to make sure that it's around the same topic...

2194
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,230
And...

2195
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:44,030
And usually it's like...

2196
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:46,030
5-7 sentences...

2197
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:48,890
Uh...

2198
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:49,170
Oh wait!

2199
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:49,890
Not 3-4...

2200
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:50,250
Okay!

2201
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,850
I heard 5!

2202
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:52,350
Okay!

2203
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:53,970
It could be 4-5...

2204
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:55,850
4-5 sentences...

2205
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:56,710
So...

2206
01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:00,110
I latched on to the 4-5 sentences part...

2207
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:01,990
I didn't care!

2208
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:03,770
I didn't care...

2209
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:05,290
What the topic was...

2210
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:06,730
Each paragraph...

2211
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:09,070
I counted my sentences...

2212
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:09,990
And I was like...

2213
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:11,650
1-2-3-4-5...

2214
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:11,910
Alright!

2215
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:13,050
Next paragraph...

2216
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,910
1-2-3-4-5...

2217
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,290
Next paragraph...

2218
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:18,530
And then they put me into ESL class...

2219
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:24,590
Because I kept doing that!

2220
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,750
I kept...

2221
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,870
I kept...

2222
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,010
Counting my paragraphs...

2223
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:33,710
I latched on to that for some reason...

2224
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,030
And...

2225
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:36,250
Also I could...

2226
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:36,470
Okay!

2227
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:37,410
To be fair...

2228
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:40,830
That wasn't part of ESL class...

2229
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:40,830
No!

2230
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:41,810
It was that!

2231
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:43,070
It was 100% that!

2232
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:45,790
Because the moment we had the lessons about paragraphs...

2233
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:47,630
They put me in ESL class...

2234
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:49,030
Like right after...

2235
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,250
I don't...

2236
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,530
It had to be that!

2237
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:55,250
Because right after...

2238
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,990
The lesson about paragraphs...

2239
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:58,970
I got put into ESL...

2240
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:00,410
Um...

2241
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:02,630
And then 1-2 years later...

2242
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:04,690
They kicked me out of ESL class...

2243
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:05,030
Because they were like...

2244
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,170
Wait!

2245
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:06,730
You're not actually ESL class!

2246
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,850
You're able to learn the other stuff well!

2247
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:10,670
Uh...

2248
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:11,630
Hahahaha...

2249
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:14,470
Hahahaha...

2250
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:16,970
So...

2251
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:19,670
I got kicked out after that!

2252
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:23,130
I was like the only student...

2253
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:23,530
Um...

2254
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:25,090
Because there was like...

2255
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,970
There was like 3 other kids...

2256
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:29,310
3-4 other kids...

2257
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,350
That was in ESL class...

2258
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:36,170
I was the only one that graduated ESL class...

2259
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,030
Hahahaha...

2260
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:43,240
Because I realized I shouldn't be there...

2261
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,080
Hahahaha...

2262
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,020
Um...

2263
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,580

2272
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,780
That was like...

2273
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:05,900
It was such a...

2274
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,500
Wow time!

2275
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:10,900

2277
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:14,320
Thank you!

2278
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:14,840
Thank you!

2279
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,680
She is so stupid!

2280
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:17,680
She's the best!

2281
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,080
I love her so much!

2282
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:19,680
It's great!

2283
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:20,540
I'm like relatable!

2284
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:23,500
You watch me so you can feel like mentally superior!

2285
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:24,840
Hahahaha...

2286
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,840
You're like... Man I'm stupid!

2287
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,540
But at least I'm not that stupid!

2288
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:32,420
Hahahaha...

2289
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,120
Hahahaha...

2290
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,260
I'm like ESL just cause she can't...

2291
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:38,280
She can't count paragraphs!

2292
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:40,380
Hahahaha...

2293
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:43,660
Um...

2294
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,360
Um...

2295
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:45,540
Um...

2296
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,380
Thank you for the super chat!

2297
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:47,800
Thank you!

2298
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:50,940
I remember you said once you played center for basketball.

2299
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,500
I still find it crazy for your height.

2300
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:52,940
That's cool!

2301
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:54,280
As a basketball fan.

2302
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:55,800
Also unrelated but you get...

2303
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:55,980
Yes!

2304
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,720
I got the gifts from Anime North!

2305
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,080
Um... There was like a lot of letters!

2306
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:00,680
Also!

2307
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,180
Uh... Speaking of like...

2308
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,700
Uh... Gifts at conventions!

2309
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,240
Um... If you want me to...

2310
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,380
Um... If you are okay...

2312
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,460
Or like talking about stuff...

2313
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,960
About your gifts... Please feel free to like...

2314
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,840

Oh you have permission to talk about it on stream.

2316
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,940
Cause I don't want to talk about something...

2317
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:22,300
You know if it was like a private gift and you don't want it to be called...

2318
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,480
Talk about on stream...

2319
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,560
Um... I don't want to talk about it just cause like...

2320
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,300
I'm worried about like you know privacy issues...

2321
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,320
For you guys... So like if you really want me...

2322
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,160
If you're okay with me to talk about it on stream...

2323
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:34,660
Just feel free to write it in the letter...

2324
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,540
And say that you're okay with it...

2325
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,040
Being talked about on stream...

2326
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,060
And yeah yeah...

2327
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,800
I was literally put in center...

2328
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,300
For basketball...

2329
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,440
Um... Because uh...

2330
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,680
Because I could jump really high...

2331
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,160
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2332
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,140
I was like... I played center position...

2333
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:54,500
But I was like...

2334
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,420
Um...

2335
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,840
I should not have been center position...

2336
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,160
It's so... It was so sad because...

2337
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,000
Um... When I first tried it for basketball...

2338
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:03,320
For one of the teams...

2339
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,360
Um... When I first tried it for basketball...

2340
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,580
Um... The... The person that was center...

2341
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,460
For the team...

2342
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,180
Like you know... She was like a senior...

2343
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,300
Well I wouldn't say...

2344
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,260
Senior... It was middle school...

2345
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,640
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2346
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,840
So like... I would be sixth grade...

2347
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,420
And she would be like an eighth grader...

2348
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,780
And then I would try it out for the basketball team...

2349
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:26,040
In sixth grade... And like obviously...

2350
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,100
I had to compete with the eighth grade center...

2351
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,020
But I... Can jump higher than her...

2352
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:31,840
So like...

2353
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,320
It doesn't... It didn't matter...

2354
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,200
And she was American... So like obviously...

2355
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,800
She was taller than me...

2356
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,180
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2357
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,680
I was a short Asian kid...

2358
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,040
And she was American...

2359
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,380
Ha ha ha ha...

2360
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,940
Ha ha ha ha...

2361
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,580
And so...

2362
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:53,160
So she was... She had some height on me...

2363
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,840
Ha ha ha ha...

2364
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,420
Ha ha ha ha...

2365
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:58,120
She was a lot taller than me...

2366
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,580
I'll just tell you that...

2367
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:02,480
She was definitely a lot taller than me...

2368
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,000
But...

2369
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,580
She was coasting... The thing is...

2370
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,360
She coasted...

2371
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,760
And the coach used me...

2372
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,160
Against her...

2373
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,880
Um... To like...

2374
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,720
Because she was like... Oh I'm tall... I don't have to jump...

2375
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,700
You know... Like that's her mindset...

2376
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,920
I remember this...

2377
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,660
Her mindset was like...

2378
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,400
Oh I'm tall... I don't need to jump...

2379
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,420
I'm fucking taller than the girls here...

2380
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:29,280
I can literally just like...

2381
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,940
Reach my hand out and just go...

2382
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:31,860
You know...

2383
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:36,100
And like hit the ball in the center position...

2384
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,520
But like the thing is...

2385
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,900
I jumped higher...

2386
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,160
I could jump really high...

2387
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,300
And like me jumping really high...

2388
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,560
I could grab the ball...

2389
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,040
I could like hit the ball before she could squat it...

2390
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,960
With her height...

2391
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,160
Ha ha ha...

2392
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:49,840
So...

2393
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,420
So basically...

2394
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:56,560
When I was first trying out the team...

2395
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,560
Um... The coach was like...

2396
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,280
I don't care... I need position...

2397
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,920
And then the coach realized...

2398
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,640
I could jump really high...

2399
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,380
And I could grab rebounds and stuff...

2400
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,440
And so she was like... Wait you want to try center?

2401
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:11,060
We're gonna have like a 5 on 5...

2402
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,660
We're gonna put me on center...

2403
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,720
And then like obviously...

2404
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,140
The actual team center...

2405
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,820
The main center...

2406
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:20,160
Because she's been the center for like 2 years...

2407
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,320
Because she's an 8th grader...

2408
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,880
We're gonna fight against her...

2409
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,700
So I'm a fucking 6th grader fighting against a really tall American...

2410
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,140
Who's been on the team for like 2 years already...

2411
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,460
Who's been the center...

2412
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:32,160
And then I was like... What the fuck?

2413
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:35,400
I was like...

2414
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,180
What the fuck?

2415
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:40,020
Why am I competing against an actual player on the team?

2416
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,720
I'm trying out...

2417
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,380
Like... I'm gonna try out...

2418
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,900
And the thing is...

2419
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,800
Obviously I was motivated...

2420
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,020
You know?

2421
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,620
I was very motivated...

2422
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,400
And I was like... Okay I gotta fucking try...

2423
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,120
And I was able to...

2424
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,780
You know... Every time I swatted the ball...

2425
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:57,200
I was able to like... Swat the ball...

2426
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,260
Before her... And then... Oh I felt so good...

2427
01:26:59,280 --> 01:26:59,920
So bad for her...

2428
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,300
Because the coach was like...

2429
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:06,580
Because the coach used me...

2430
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:07,500
As like...

2431
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,980
Like an example...

2432
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,000
And she was like...

2433
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,680
See?

2434
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:13,640
She's able to grab the ball...

2435
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,860
Before you...

2436
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,080
She's a 6th grader...

2437
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,380
Who jumps...

2438
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:24,160
And actually wants it...

2439
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,220
Because the other girl was coasting...

2440
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:27,920
Because she thought...

2441
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,640
Nobody was gonna fucking get it...

2442
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,300
Um... Anyway...

2443
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,920
I took center position...

2444
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,680
From her...

2445
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,080
I ended up...

2446
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,860
Taking... Becoming a starter...

2447
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:43,560
I became the starter...

2448
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,280
5...

2449
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,220
And got into the team...

2450
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:48,620
And I took center from her...

2451
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,600
In 6th grade...

2452
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,420
I became a starter...

2453
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:01,340
I became a starter...

2454
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,120
I became a starter...

2455
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:06,700
Alright... Thank you for the super chat...

2456
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,100
Thank you...

2457
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,560
Doki will never be balling...

2458
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,600
Doki is fucking balling...

2459
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,000
Thank you for the super chat...

2460
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:13,460
Thank you...

2461
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:16,920
Because the other player...

2462
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,660
The other player...

2463
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:19,640
She coasted...

2464
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,980
And never got better enough...

2465
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,520
Because I would always...

2466
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:26,940
Um...

2467
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:27,700
Um...

2468
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,340
I was like always...

2469
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,700
I was very determined in like...

2470
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,100
Being the best...

2471
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,300
By the way I hated basketball...

2472
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,300
By the way...

2473
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,360
The other part of the story...

2474
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,440
Was that I hated basketball...

2475
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,060
Uh...

2476
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,500
Like it was...

2477
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,860
I didn't like hate hate basketball...

2478
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:50,140
But like out of all the sports...

2479
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,960
I tried out for it...

2480
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:53,880
And...

2481
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,420
Basketball was my least favorite...

2482
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:59,280
My most favorite was soccer and volleyball...

2483
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,460
I loved soccer and volleyball the most...

2484
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,360
Basketball was at the lowest tier...

2485
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,420
But like at that time...

2486
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:06,200
I was trying out for all the sports...

2487
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,860
Because it's like per season...

2488
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:08,540
So...

2489
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:10,880
But like I knew...

2490
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,680
And I was really good at basketball...

2491
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,920
Like uh...

2492
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,220
And I was like really good at it...

2493
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,420
So that's why like I played basketball...

2494
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,180
Because I knew I was really good at it...

2495
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:20,820
And I was super...

2496
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,640
I'm still super competitive...

2497
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,300
And the funny thing is...

2498
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:28,420
I became the captain of the basketball team...

2499
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:29,800
Um...

2500
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,160
At one point...

2501
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:33,600
Hahahaha...

2502
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,480
It was my least favorite sport...

2503
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,940
But I was the captain of the basketball team...

2504
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:42,980
But I was the captain of the basketball team...

2505
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:44,180
Not in sixth grade though...

2506
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:45,660
Not in sixth grade...

2507
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:47,920
Hahahaha...

2508
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,360
Hahahaha...

2509
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,580
Like I would always be like...

2510
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,800
I hate... I don't like the basketball guys...

2511
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:54,800
Hahahaha...

2512
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,460
I just never enjoyed basketball...

2513
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,820
As much as the other sports...

2514
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,560
But I knew I was good at it...

2515
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:03,700
Because I had really good hand-eye coordination...

2516
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,480
I always had like...

2517
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,380
Really good hand-eye coordination...

2518
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:10,380
And...

2519
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:11,460
Um...

2520
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,060
And like uh...

2521
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,180
And like...

2522
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:16,800
And so like I just like playing a lot of sports...

2523
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,100
And that's why I'm really good at FPS...

2524
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:20,680
Oh my god...

2525
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,600
One time...

2526
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,360
One of my math teachers...

2527
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,740
Who was like a coach of...

2528
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:25,200
I don't know...

2529
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:25,980
I think he was like...

2530
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:28,620
I think he was a volleyball coach...

2531
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:29,420
And he like...

2532
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:31,600
Because I had a class...

2533
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,560
He was like one of my grade teachers...

2534
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,340
Like not math teacher...

2535
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,600
He was like the grade teacher for us...

2536
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,800
Like the homeroom teacher...

2537
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,320
And I remember...

2538
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,300
Because at one point I was like coasting...

2539
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,540
Because I knew I was good at hand-eye coordination...

2540
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,820
And I was coasting and stuff...

2541
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:47,320
Like I didn't...

2542
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,180
Because at that point I was like...

2543
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:50,040
Oh yeah whatever...

2544
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,920
I know I'm the best player...

2545
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,060
I know I'm really good...

2546
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,580
And um...

2547
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,900
I remember like...

2548
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,580
My homeroom teacher pulled me aside...

2549
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:02,720
And was like...

2550
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,340
No because they were like a volleyball coach...

2551
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,400
They were a really good volleyball coach...

2552
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,280
And they were like... They pulled me aside...

2553
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,080
And was like...

2554
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,620
Um...

2555
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:15,700
I don't remember what he said...

2556
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,300
He was like... He pulled me aside after class...

2557
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,340
To talk about like...

2558
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,300
Sports...

2559
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,980
Like I think volleyball or something...

2560
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,660
It was either volleyball season or soccer season...

2561
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:28,240
And he was like...

2562
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,560
Look Doki...

2563
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,590
We know you have really good hand-eye coordination...

2564
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,740
But you could be better...

2565
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:36,590
You could be so much better...

2566
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:37,980
You could be so much better...

2567
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,560
You could be so much better...

2568
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,240
I was just like... What the fuck...

2569
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,720
He pulled me aside...

2570
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,880
He was like... If you train harder...

2571
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,880
You could be the very best...

2572
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,330
You have really good hand-eye coordination...

2573
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:54,620
You have so much potential...

2574
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,060
I was like... What the...

2575
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:01,940
I remember I was like...

2576
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:03,740
I think I was in middle school...

2577
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:05,580
And I was just like... What the fuck...

2578
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,580
I didn't know what to say...

2579
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:08,180
I...

2580
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:15,760
I was already on the volleyball team...

2581
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,420
That's the thing...

2582
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,380
I was already... Bro... No...

2583
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,800
Volleyball fucked up my arm...

2584
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,620
Um...

2585
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:25,760
I was a really talented volleyball player...

2586
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,300
Uh...

2587
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:30,340
Because in 6th grade... I was able to do overhand serves...

2588
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,320
Um...

2589
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,080
And that was like...

2590
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,560
A huge skill to have...

2591
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,320
As a 6th grader...

2592
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,360
So like... Because they were teaching us...

2593
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,360
Normal serving...

2594
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,840
And I was like... Oh I wanna do...

2595
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,700
I wanna learn... I would see people doing overhand serves...

2596
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:46,880
Like... Oh I wanna learn overhand serving...

2597
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,120
So like in 6th grade...

2598
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,460
I learned how to do overhand serving...

2599
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,960
While all the other 6th graders were doing underhand serving...

2600
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,020
So like... And then on the team...

2601
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,160
I was like... Really good...

2602
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,600
At like... Serving...

2603
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,560
My serves were insane...

2604
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,500
Um... And...

2605
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,740
To the point... Where...

2606
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,180
I was like...

2607
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:09,020
I would be put as the starter server...

2608
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:10,800
That was like my position...

2609
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,860
Because I could do overhand serves...

2610
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:14,520
As a 6th grader...

2611
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,940
And like... My serves are very hard to hit...

2612
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,100
Apparently...

2613
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,740
Because like... They were saying that when I serve...

2614
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,220
The ball doesn't move...

2615
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:23,400
The ball...

2616
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,660
I don't know how to say it...

2617
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,340
The ball doesn't spin...

2618
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,720
And people were saying that...

2619
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,200
It's so hard to hit...

2620
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,000
Because the ball didn't spin...

2621
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:34,780
When I hit it...

2622
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,480
So like... It was harder to control it...

2623
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,200
When you hit the ball...

2624
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,120
So... I don't know how I did it...

2625
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,620
I just fucking hit the ball...

2626
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:43,940
Like...

2627
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,540
I don't know...

2628
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,320
So... Whenever I serve...

2629
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,440
Cause like... I don't know why they couldn't hit it...

2630
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,220
But they were like... Bro the ball doesn't move...

2631
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:01,960
They were like...

2632
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,020
It doesn't move when you serve...

2633
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:06,100
So like... This is how intense it is...

2634
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,200
When I serve...

2635
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,220
I was starting server...

2636
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:12,020
And I would hit... I would get our team...

2637
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:13,960
10 to 15 points...

2638
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:16,880
Umm...

2639
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:17,720
I... Literally...

2640
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,020
One... I remember...

2641
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,280
Two of the schools we faced...

2642
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,700
I would be put at starting server...

2643
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,760
And I would get like 10 plus points off the bat...

2644
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,740
By just serving... It was so sad...

2645
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,920
It was so...

2646
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,840
It was so sad...

2647
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,000
I would get like 10 plus points...

2648
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,340
By serving only...

2649
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:36,700
Cause I was put at the starter...

2650
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,780
And then like... I would just be like...

2651
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:41,680
And then like... It was so fucking sad...

2652
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,340
And...

2653
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:46,440
I think like... It was like 7th grade...

2654
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,980
Or 8th grade...

2655
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:49,840
I fucked up my arm...

2656
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,340
Because my coach...

2657
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:54,100
Umm...

2658
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:55,100
Do you need 25?

2659
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,880
One time I got like 20 points... I remember now...

2660
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:59,260
I can't remember the maximum...

2661
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:01,560
I think I remember... One time I got 20 points in a row...

2662
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:02,760
Against the team...

2663
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,380
And I fucked up my arm...

2664
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:08,160
In like either 7th or 8th grade...

2665
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,180
Because my coach really wanted...

2666
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:13,160
It was like my coach really wanted to win against this one game...

2667
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:13,800
It was like my coach really wanted to win against this one game...

2668
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,700
And I sprained my...

2669
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,880
I had muscle aches on my arm...

2670
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,800
To the point where like the coach...

2671
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,240
All the coach did was like they applied cream to it...

2672
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:23,460
Or something like muscle...

2673
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,160
I don't know what kind of cream to it...

2674
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,920
And ever since that day...

2675
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:29,260
I couldn't do those serves anymore...

2676
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:29,980
Umm...

2677
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:31,320
Because it like messed up...

2678
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:34,120
Like I over strained it so much from it...

2679
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:35,680
That like I couldn't do the strain...

2680
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,660
My career ended so...

2681
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,960
No... I wouldn't say my career ended so fast...

2682
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,800
Because I could still serve...

2683
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,100
But I couldn't do that...

2684
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:45,100
That serve anymore...

2685
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:47,760
Like I couldn't do that serve anymore...

2686
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,460
Umm...

2687
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:51,160
It was so bad...

2688
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,240
It was like one tournament...

2689
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:54,980
It was one tournament...

2690
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:57,440
Where I lost the power...

2691
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,220
I think it was 8th grade...

2692
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:02,560
It was 8th grade...

2693
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,060
I think so...

2694
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:04,040
Because it was like 2 years...

2695
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,620
I was known as the best server...

2696
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:07,620
And then like in 8th grade...

2697
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:10,480
In 8th grade for one of the tournaments...

2698
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:13,200
I fucked up my arm so much...

2699
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,460
That like...

2700
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:16,400
Umm...

2701
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,140
I couldn't do that serve anymore...

2702
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,440
I think like if I do...

2703
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,920
I think like if I trained again...

2704
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,520
If I could have trained again...

2705
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:25,860
If I could try and replicate again...

2706
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:28,940
Maybe I would have been able to grab that...

2707
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:30,660
Been able to do it again...

2708
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,420
But like it was just natural...

2709
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:34,000
It was like a natural thing I did...

2710
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,180
Like a natural talent...

2711
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:38,280
Because like literally in 6th grade I could just do overhand stuff...

2712
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,140
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2713
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:42,440
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2714
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:43,600
Ha ha ha ha ha...

2715
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:44,840
Umm...

2716
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,260
Yeah you're...

2717
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:50,700
The legendary player that retired after getting over it...

2718
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:53,240
They patched my exploit...

2719
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,960
Guys there was a new patch guys...

2720
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:57,480
There was a new patch...

2721
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,220
Ha ha ha...

2722
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:00,980
We got Doki2OP...

2723
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,020
Ha ha ha...

2724
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,740
Must nerf...

2725
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:05,900
Umm...

2726
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:07,480
They literally nerfed me...

2727
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,200
They did...

2728
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,580
I was too good...

2729
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:14,480
Yeah I got nerfed IRL...

2730
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,620
They patched me out...

2731
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,060
Bro the people hated...

2732
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,860
They hated...

2733
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:21,580
The thing is...

2734
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:22,880
The thing is...

2735
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,900
I could do whatever the floating shit you were saying...

2736
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,840
Like the whatever...

2737
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,980
When you guys were calling my serve like the floating whatever...

2738
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,640
I could do that in underhand...

2739
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:32,700
The funniest part...

2740
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:35,240
Was that I couldn't do it overhand anymore...

2741
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,540
So I started doing it underhand...

2742
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:39,300
And I could do the float serve...

2743
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,920
Like I could do it on underhand as well...

2744
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:42,800
Umm...

2745
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,240
So sometimes like if I had to...

2746
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,900
I would use underhand serve to like guarantee it...

2747
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:48,760
Because I knew how...

2748
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:49,560
Umm...

2749
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:52,300
I could do it underhand...

2750
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,900
Like underhand serve...

2751
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,120
But because like...

2752
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,380
I don't know...

2753
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:59,740
I just remember we got like 10 points from it...

2754
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:01,900
Because it was like around that time...

2755
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,420
We were down...

2756
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,280
I remember we were down like...

2757
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,060
We were down...

2758
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,080
It was like...

2759
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,180
I think it was like 20 to 10 or something...

2760
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,000
It was like 20 to 10...

2761
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,940
And then it was my turn to serve...

2762
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,660
Obviously I couldn't do overhand anymore...

2763
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,640
Because like... I... It was...

2764
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:23,060
I think like it was like...

2765
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:26,080
It was a tournament after I fucked up my arm...

2766
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:27,180
So...

2767
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:30,680
It was a tournament after I fucked up my arm...

2768
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:31,700
And...

2769
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,180
The thing was that...

2770
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:33,880
Umm...

2771
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,700
We had to win this game...

2772
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,740
To head to semi-finals...

2773
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,460
Because like it was such a weird bracket...

2774
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:43,520
It was like first versus fourth...

2775
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:43,700
Oh!

2776
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,860
I remember!

2777
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,040
Oh my god it was such a...

2778
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,620
Really happy memory for me...

2779
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:50,080
Because it was first...

2780
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,860
First place versus fourth place team...

2781
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,760
My team... My school was the fourth place team...

2782
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,640
My team...

2783
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:56,640
My school was the fourth place team...

2784
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,600
And... Umm...

2785
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,980
And like obviously we weren't guaranteed...

2786
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,260
We weren't gonna win...

2787
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:04,200
We thought we weren't gonna win it because we were fourth place...

2788
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,180
Umm...

2789
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:06,980
And like we were up against like you know...

2790
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:09,340
The main team...

2791
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:11,760
The main team that was first place...

2792
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,540
And...

2793
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:15,400
And we win it... We head to the semi-finals...

2794
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,480
We would be playing against first versus second...

2795
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:19,080
So... We would do like...

2796
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,180
We would head straight to the semi-finals...

2797
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:22,560
And play first versus second...

2798
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,900
And like... I remember it was like 20...

2799
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,340
20 to 10... And then I was up...

2800
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,860
And I ended up getting...

2801
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,660
I remember I got 14 points...

2802
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:32,600
I remember...

2803
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,840
I got 14 points with underhand serve...

2804
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,240
Because my overhand...

2805
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,500
At that time was not consistent anymore...

2806
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,740
Because I would sometimes hit the net...

2807
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:43,040
Because I fucked up my arm...

2808
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,740
Umm... So...

2809
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,040
I ended up getting...

2810
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,680
But it was one set...

2811
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,680
The thing is... We had to play two sets...

2812
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:53,020
I got us the first set from that...

2813
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,460
And then we won the second set...

2814
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,760
Because the first place team was so sad...

2815
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:58,580
HAHAHAHAHAHA...

2816
01:39:59,420 --> 01:39:59,980
HAHAHAHAHAHA...

2817
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:02,140
I remember... Because the first place...

2818
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:03,520
And I got MVP...

2819
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,060
Because like MVP...

2820
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:08,200
Was chosen by all the coaches...

2821
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,440
Like every coach nominates like...

2822
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,420
Each player from each school...

2823
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:15,340
To get MVP... And I got MVP for that...

2824
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,420
Like because all the coaches nominated me...

2825
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:19,900
As MVP... And we crushed their morale...

2826
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,320
By winning the first set...

2827
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:22,840
That we won the second set...

2828
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,700
And we were so happy... We got second place...

2829
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:27,620
Because we were not good enough for first...

2830
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:30,020
HAHAHAHAHAHA...

2831
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:30,980
HAHAHAHAHA...

2832
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:32,440
We were...

2833
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:35,740
We were not... We were just happy to be second...

2834
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:37,240
We were so surprised...

2835
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:37,880
We were like...

2836
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:41,700
Because we were not supposed to be there...

2837
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:43,260
HAHAHAHAHA...

2838
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:44,320
HAHAHAHAHA...

2839
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:47,240
We were happy just to be second...

2840
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,080
Because we did not... We did not win the semis...

2841
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:50,940
We got like...

2842
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:53,080
Too old... So fast...

2843
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:54,540
HAHAHAHAHA...

2844
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:57,520
But like... But I did the underhand serve...

2845
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,460
The first set...

2846
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,000
I did the underhand serve...

2847
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,120
And it was a floater...

2848
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:04,940
The ball didn't move... It literally...

2849
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,320
The ball didn't spin...

2850
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,380
So like... I remember... And I got like...

2851
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,440
14 points from just serving...

2852
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:12,640
HAHAHAHAHA...

2853
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:13,760
HAHAHAHAHA...

2854
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,280
Because I was like... Guys... I was like... I'm not gonna risk it...

2855
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,060
Guys... I'm not gonna risk overhand serving...

2856
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:20,720
We need these points... I'm gonna do my underhand...

2857
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:22,380
HAHAHAHAHA...

2858
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:24,500

Thank you... Thank you...

I tell you... I used to do... It's why I'm like...

2864
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,400
Good at hand-eye coordination... Because I used to do a lot...

2865
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,380
Of sports back then... Growing up...

2866
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:39,960
From like... Middle school to high school...

2867
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:41,060
Um...

2868
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:44,200
So like... I had just had...

2869
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,180
It was an easy transition to play like...

2870
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:48,060
FPS games... Um...

2871
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,160
But yeah... We were so happy for second place...

2872
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:51,880
Like we literally don't... We were like...

2873
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,620
We were not supposed to be here...

2874
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:55,140
HAHAHAHAHA...

2875
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:58,300
We were not supposed to be here...

2876
01:41:59,440 --> 01:41:59,960
HAHAHAHAHA...

2877
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:02,780

It was like... It was fun... I love...

2884
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:17,760
I love doing... I think like a lot of my happiest memories...

2885
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,780
Were just back then... Um... In middle...

2886
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:22,080
High school... Where just like the sports...

2887
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,680
That I used to play... Cause it was fun...

2888
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,900
I loved... I loved being competitive...

2889
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:28,280
Uh... You know like... I never...

2890
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:30,280
I never realized...

2891
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:31,800
How good I was at sports...

2892
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:33,500
Until 5th grade...

2893
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,780
Um... In Canada... I didn't really...

2894
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,860
Do... I didn't really do sports...

2895
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:39,420
We just had PE classes...

2896
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,640
We didn't have like actual like...

2897
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,440
Sports teams... I mean cause we were in like...

2898
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,660
Elementary school... You know... We were in...

2899
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:48,140
Elementary school... And the only...

2900
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:49,360
Reason why...

2901
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,500
I got into sports... Is that...

2902
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,900
In 5th grade... 5th grade is when I actually...

2903
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,760
Went to international school... When I started like...

2904
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,060
Moving around...

2905
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,540
And... Um... Obviously...

2906
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:01,560
It was still elementary... Elementary school...

2907
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,360
5th grade... Um...

2908
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,860
And... I remember... Uh... We had like an after...

2909
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:07,640
School activity... Where we could sign up for...

2910
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:09,220
Several... Um...

2911
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,700
Where we signed up for several after school...

2912
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,760
Activities... One of them...

2913
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,920
Was soccer... Um...

2914
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,560
And then I would just like... You know...

2915
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,820
I was one of the few girls that signed up for soccer...

2916
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:21,400
Every... All the other guys...

2917
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,940
All the other kids there were guys...

2918
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,620
And... Sometimes...

2919
01:43:25,620 --> 01:43:28,020
There would be like middle schoolers there too...

2920
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:29,580
So it was like super intimidating...

2921
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:32,100
And stuff... And... Um...

2922
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,300
In 5th grade...

2923
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,880
Our goalie... We would do like...

2924
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:37,860
We would do like...

2925
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,520
We would do like... Uh...

2926
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,520
Uh...

2927
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,900
We would do like scrims and stuff...

2928
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,840
Like... We would do like scrims... Um...

2929
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,900
Uh... Where... We would play like...

2930
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,880
Soccer... And stuff... And then I would play like...

2931
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:51,340
As like defense or...

2932
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:53,780
Offense... I played defense...

2933
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:55,760
Or offense... And then on the last...

2934
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,300
Day... Our goalkeeper...

2935
01:43:58,300 --> 01:43:59,940
Wanted to play offense...

2936
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:01,740
And they told me...

2937
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:03,820
They were like... Hey come through goalkeeper...

2938
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,880
On the last day of the...

2939
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,620
On the last day...

2940
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,800
Of the after school activity...

2941
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,040
And from there...

2942
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,800
I... I caught majority...

2943
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:15,160
Of the shots...

2944
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,860
And that's when I knew...

2945
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:20,180
I had really good hand-eye coordination...

2946
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:21,340
And like...

2947
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:23,760
I could be a really good goalkeeper...

2948
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,280
And the coach there...

2949
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:28,200
After the games... The coach there...

2950
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,860
Was like...

2951
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:31,540
Was like...

2952
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,800
You should try out for the soccer team...

2953
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,220
In middle school... When you like...

2954
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:36,340
For the year after... Like...

2955
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:40,000
When you get to sixth grade... You should try out for the soccer team...

2956
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,540
Like you should really try out...

2957
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,700
For goalkeeper...

2958
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:42,920
Like...

2959
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:49,380
Because I caught...

2960
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:51,240
Majority of the shots...

2961
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:52,300
And...

2962
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:54,060
The thing was that...

2963
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:57,760
The thing was that...

2964
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,220
Like...

2965
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,300
We were playing against like...

2966
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:01,780
Middle schoolers too... So it was like...

2967
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:04,040
Like fifth graders with middle schoolers too...

2968
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:04,900
And...

2969
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:07,260
I really... And then I had a really fun time...

2970
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:09,840
I was like... Wait... Soccer is pretty fun...

2971
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,100
Because like...

2972
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,240
Before then... I was just like...

2973
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,560
You know... I was just like...

2974
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,120
Kickball... Yay...

2975
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,500
You know... I was a fucking fifth grader...

2976
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,320
But it wasn't being like... I love soccer...

2977
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:24,880
I was just like... Yay...

2978
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:27,200
Kickball...

2979
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,440
And then...

2980
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:31,240
Uh...

2981
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,580
And then there... And then like...

2982
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:35,560
I swapped to goalkeeper... I was like... Wait...

2983
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,320
This is fun...

2984
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,680
Wait a minute... Soccer...

2985
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:43,580
Can be really fun...

2986
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:53,280
And that's when I started doing...

2987
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:56,060
And from there... I started participating...

2988
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:57,680
In like... When I hit to...

2989
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,360
Middle school... I started doing like...

2990
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:01,760
Like everything changed... When I got to be a goalkeeper...

2991
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:03,960
And then I started really enjoying...

2992
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:06,020
Like sports... Because it was like...

2993
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:07,500
I had... I had enjoyment...

2994
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,440
Out of it... Uh...

2995
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,720
I think... When I was in...

2996
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:13,900
I would like... I really like being goalkeeper...

2997
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:16,240
I don't know... I just like catching balls...

2998
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:18,160
Like... I don't know... It's just fun...

2999
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,520
It's just... My...

3000
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,580
My goal kick... Was...

3001
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:23,780
I had insane...

3002
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:25,940
Goal kick... Goalie kick...

3003
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:27,460
So like... You know when you get the ball...

3004
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:29,660
And you kick it as a goalie... And you can do like...

3005
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,480
The punt... My punt...

3006
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:34,340
Would literally go all the way to the other goalie...

3007
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:38,740
The other goalie...

3008
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:40,860
Like...

3009
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,600
Yeah... Like I would...

3010
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,400
Kick the ball... And it would...

3011
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,480
Like when... You know... Like the... The punt...

3012
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:49,680
Not the like ground shot... Like the...

3013
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,400
The punt kick... And they would go...

3014
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:53,560
All the way... To the...

3015
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:55,100
Other goalkeeper...

3016
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:59,320
So I had to like...

3017
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,000
Control it...

3018
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:05,720
Because if I just kick it, it just goes all the way there and then the other...

3019
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,220
Because I've done that a few times when I didn't know how to control it.

3020
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,000
Because I would just kick it to...

3021
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,740
Because I was just like, get it as far as possible.

3022
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:13,520
Because you grab the ball and then you kick it.

3023
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:16,180
So I was like, get it as far as possible.

3024
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,200
So that I would just kick it and then we'll just head to the other side.

3025
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:21,980
And then the other side goalkeeper would just pick it up and be like, what the fuck?

3026
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:26,640
This was in 6th grade.

3027
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,220
This was in 6th grade.

3028
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:34,000
And then I had to learn how to control where I actually kick it to the...

3029
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,560
I would kick it to the other side near the goalkeeper.

3030
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:38,180
But not to the goalkeeper.

3031
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,620
I remember because I would kick it to the goalkeeper.

3032
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:45,220
The goalkeeper would catch it and be like, what the fuck?

3033
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:48,140
Because people would be like, why is it here?

3034
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:54,540
Yeah.

3035
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:57,320
And then...

3036
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,060
Yeah.

3037
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:01,740
And then so I had to learn how to actually kick it to a player.

3038
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,920
Instead of kicking it as far as I can.

3039
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:11,320
But I miss soccer.

3040
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,460
I miss soccer and volleyball.

3041
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,920
Soccer and volleyball was my favorite sports of all time.

3042
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:17,560
Broken bottom.

3043
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:18,700
Thank you for the super chat.

3044
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:19,140
Thank you.

3045
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:19,740
Thank you.

3046
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:22,000
Are you the captain of Mario Sports?

3047
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:22,860
Thank you.

3048
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,020
Thank you for the super chat.

3049
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:24,440
Thank you.

3050
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:24,940
Thank you.

3051
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,240
I just enjoyed sports.

3052
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,540
I enjoyed it.

3053
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:28,460
Since middle school.

3054
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:30,200
All the way to high school.

3055
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,720
I really enjoyed playing sports.

3056
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:32,600
It's just...

3057
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,360
It's just fun.

3058
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,700
I was a very competitive person.

3059
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,560
Oh my god.

3060
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:39,960
I...

3061
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:40,320
Whoa!

3062
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,800
It's almost two...

3063
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,300
I yacked for so long.

3064
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,840
Oh my gosh.

3065
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,600
It's almost two hours.

3066
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:47,460
Holy shit.

3067
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:49,960

3069
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,300

3072
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:57,940

Dark blade.

Full 100% permission to talk about my gift and letter if you want.

3102
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:36,920

Thank you.

3104
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:38,260

I really appreciate it.

3108
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:41,340
Bite size.

3109
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:43,020
Thanks for the yapping before bed.

3110
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:44,520
It's good to have it back.

3111
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,220
Thank you for the super chat.

3112
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:45,540
Thank you.

3113
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:45,760
Thank you.

3114
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:45,940
Yeah.

3115
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:46,580
I want to make this...

3116
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:46,940
Like I said.

3117
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,180
I want to make this a consistent series.

3118
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:51,800
This series was postponed for a little bit.

3119
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:55,220
Because we had Tekken.

3120
01:49:55,980 --> 01:49:56,300
Then...

3121
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:57,080
Tekken.

3122
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:58,000
Then WrestleTuber.

3123
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:58,860
Then Minecraft.

3124
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,480
Back to back to back.

3125
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,760
So there was so much stuff to...

3126
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,020
There was so much stuff to do.

3127
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:08,880
But the series is back now.

3128
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,460
Unless I get in...

3129
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:11,120
Get busy.

3130
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:11,760
But yeah.

3131
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:14,260
It was a fun time yapping with all of you guys.

3132
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,440
I had a great time.

3133
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:17,400
I'm always so busy behind the scenes.

3134
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,980
But it's always nice to do a stream for you guys.

3135
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,660
Or just hang out and talk.

3136
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:21,640
Because I always...

3137
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:23,780
I really enjoy talking with all of you guys.

3138
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,640
And I hope you guys have a nice...

3139
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:27,060
Nice...

3140
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:27,340
Rest.

3141
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:28,960
Or like...

3142
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,040
A nice morning.

3143
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:31,020
For work.

3144
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:31,520
Or school.

3145
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:33,880
Good yappernoon.

3146
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:34,840
Hey Tenjin.

3147
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:35,720
Hey.

3148
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:37,820
I was just about to end that.

3149
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:40,300
But yes guys.

3150
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,540
I'll see you guys next time.

3151
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:43,700
I'll see you guys tomorrow everybody.

3152
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:44,740
As always everyone.

3153
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:45,880
Stay hydrated.

3154
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:46,740
Posture check.

3155
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,560
Get up and move around.

3156
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:48,780
To get that blood flowing.

3157
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:49,400
And if you...

3158
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,260
Sit up for me.

3159
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,360
Head to bed.

3160
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:52,940
Because you deserve it.

3161
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:54,100
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3162
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:55,560

3163
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:56,800
