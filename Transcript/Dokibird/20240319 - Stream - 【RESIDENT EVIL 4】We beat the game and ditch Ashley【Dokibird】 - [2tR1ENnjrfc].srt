1
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,070
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,510
Hello, hello!

3
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,550
Welcome everybody!

4
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,810
Today we are gonna finish Resident Evil 4.

5
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,230
Because I know it's not that long.

6
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,990
Okay, it's like 5 hours I think.

7
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,530
Like around 5 hours.

8
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,390
So it's gonna be a while.

9
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,690
We're gonna be here for a while.

10
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,170
But also, how do I know this?

11
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:24,530
Because sometimes when I'm like hesitant and be like Did chat tell me the right that I'm like almost done?

12
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,450
I was thinking like, was chat right when I asked them how much I have left of the game?

13
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,530
So sometimes if I don't wanna risk it and I would like look up.

14
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,450
I don't spoil myself.

15
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,890
I just find the exact part where I stop at.

16
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,710
So I'll look up and be like Resident Evil 4 playthrough.

17
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,970
No commentary.

18
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,590
And then I try and find the area where I stop.

19
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,110
And I can't believe I got gaslit.

20
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,830
I got gaslit so fucking hard in that Ashley level.

21
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:04,790
Remember that level where you guys were like Oh my god Doki, how dare you skip that part because somebody told you the answer for the clock.

22
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,590
That was like one minute.

23
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,010
One minute.

24
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:17,130
Because the piece of paper where I find the time of like how much I had to like of the time of the clock was literally right next to me.

25
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,770
It was like one minute that I missed.

26
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:27,470
And then people in that chat were like wow Doki how fucking could you eliminating that content from us.

27
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,430
How could you Doki?

28
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,310
I can't believe it.

29
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,010
Wow.

30
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,990
It was one minute of content.

31
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,070
I can't believe all of you yelled at me for one minute of content.

32
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,090
I thought I missed out on something very important.

33
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,150
Like I was like oh my god.

34
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,210
I missed out on something very important.

35
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,290
Did I actually skip like 30 minutes of the Ashley level?

36
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,770
It was one minute.

37
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,550
It was fucking one minute.

38
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,050
The paper was right next to me.

39
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,030
Oh my god.

40
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,590
We missed one minute of Doki being skipped.

41
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,610
How could you Doki?

42
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,850
How could you do this to us?

43
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,070
It was one fucking minute.

44
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:27,510
I was like wow let me see how much I actually missed out on by doing the clock like right away instead of trying to find the clue.

45
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,530
I can't fucking believe you guys.

46
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,130
She's on to us.

47
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,350
Thank you for the super chat.

48
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:34,810
Thank you.

49
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,390
Thank you.

50
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,230
I can't believe it.

51
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,710
D-Dragon finish it Doki.

52
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,230
I've never seen the island.

53
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,170
I don't wait.

54
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,710
Good luck on today's run.

55
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,030
Thank you for the super chat.

56
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,670
Thank you.

57
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,350
Thank you.

58
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,170
It would have been a viral clip Doki.

59
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,170
You don't understand.

60
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,110
Also, did you guys hear about the ALGS stuff?

61
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,390
I was watching it live on Nice Wig stream.

62
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,830
Because I was curious.

63
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,390
And then I...

64
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,350
And I was like... and then like I tabbed out and was like looking at my Twitter.

65
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,630
And then people were like talking about it.

66
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,330
So for those who don't follow Apex Legends.

67
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,630
E-sports scene.

68
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,210
Two pro players got hacked live during the tournament.

69
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,890
And this is not just like a regular... it was like basically the finals to LAN.

70
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,550
So like whoever does really well in the finals for Apex goes to LAN.

71
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,650
So like this was like real shit.

72
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,550
So it was the... okay I'm sorry.

73
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,350
I know it's so fucked up.

74
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,990
But it was so funny.

75
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,610
Because like...

76
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,910
So the two players were JenBurden and ImperialHal.

77
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,610
And it was so funny because when it happened to JenBurden.

78
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,250
He was like I'm getting hacked.

79
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,890
I'm getting hacked.

80
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,250
And then he left the game instantly.

81
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,510
And then...

82
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,410
And then when it happened to Hal.

83
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,650
Hal was like oh my god.

84
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,830
I'm getting hacked.

85
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,850
But what if I just stop shooting?

86
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,460
Because he's like but what if I just don't shoot guys?

87
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,520
What if I just don't shoot?

88
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,740
I'm cheating.

89
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm cheating.

90
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,400
And then...

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
And then they were like...

92
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,800
And then he proceeds to kill people with aimbot.

93
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,160
It was so fucking funny.

94
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
He's like...

95
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,360
He just started...

96
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,900
Proceeds to keep playing.

97
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,800
And also continues to kill people with aimbot.

98
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,540
And then they were like...

99
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,900
And then like other pro players were like why the fuck did you not leave?

100
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,560
And then Hal was like...

101
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,660
I don't know.

102
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,580
He was like...

103
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:45,860
No.

104
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,320
That 1v1 I had was my aim assist.

105
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,780
Like I know I did that.

106
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,660
And then people were like...

107
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,760
People were like...

108
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,900
It's so fucked up when you can't tell if it's aim assist or if it was aimbot.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,140
Like no one knows.

110
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,160
Because no one knows if he used aimbot or if it was aim assist.

111
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,620
Because we can't tell.

112
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,300
It was...

113
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,600
We can't tell.

114
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,460
They were like...

115
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,040
It was like 1v1.

116
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,540
And they were like up close.

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,440
So no one knows which one it was.

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
So like people can't tell if it was off or not.

119
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,720
And...

120
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,300
So that happened during the Apex tournament.

121
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,700
And the scary thing is that no one knows how this person did it.

122
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,320
It's apparently like a security breach.

123
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,920
But the thing is...

124
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,940
I think like what people...

125
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,080
Like...

126
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,640
Okay.

127
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,840
So like this hacker...

128
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,200
A lot of like the normies are like really scared.

129
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,660
They're like...

130
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:45,940
Oh!

131
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,080
Don't turn on...

132
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,040
Don't play Apex right now.

133
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,600
Don't do it.

134
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,500
Don't play Apex.

135
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,420
Uninstall Apex.

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,400
Don't even touch it.

137
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,820
Because there's a security breach.

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,820
But like the thing is...

139
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,920
Only this hacker has that...

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,160
Has that power.

141
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,720
This is only like...

142
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,940
It's a very well known...

143
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,840
This hacker has been around in the Apex community for a while.

144
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,680
He always does these crazy hacks.

145
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,480
He always does these crazy hacks.

146
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,640
On like pro players.

147
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,880
But this is like the first time...

148
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,600
He is...

149
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,340
He has like...

150
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,860
He has like done this in the tournament.

151
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,100
Because he's hacked HAL.

152
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,960
And he has...

153
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,080
He has hacked HAL.

154
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,480
And he has hacked Mandate before in the past.

155
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
This is the same hacker.

156
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,440
So like...

157
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,640
People don't know yet.

158
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,660
So like a lot of people are scared.

159
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,100
Because they're like...

160
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,420
Oh what if it's my turn next?

161
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:32,980
Yeah.

162
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,100
He's just there.

163
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,880
He's doing it for publicity basically.

164
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,460
Like he's just some kid that's doing this for publicity.

165
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,140
Some very fucking smart kid.

166
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,460
I don't know.

167
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,020
So I feel like right now...

168
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,440
I know it's like if you want to be safe, don't touch Apex.

169
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,760
But most likely...

170
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,320
Like since he's like the only kid that has like this power.

171
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,720
Like the people out there that are not like public figures.

172
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
They're okay.

173
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,220
Like they're okay.

174
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,740
Like the non-public figures are okay right now.

175
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,500
Because...

176
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,660
Because he's just targeting.

177
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,660
He's done this before.

178
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,620
He's breached the Apex like security.

179
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,440
My god.

180
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,720
Multiple times before.

181
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,480
But this has been like the biggest publicity stunt he has ever done.

182
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,140
You know when like...

183
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,900
Okay so those who have seen the clip of like the Jen Burnham clip.

184
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,280
When he like brought up a...

185
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,440
When he brought up the aimbot.

186
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,940
Because like he brings up the aimbot.

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,440
If you look so closely.

188
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,580
If you look closely at the aimbot like app that he had open.

189
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,720
It's...

190
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,740
It's...

191
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,440
It's...

192
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,740
It's...

193
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,920
It's a fucking meme.

194
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,520
It's not even a real like aimbot app.

195
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,140
Like the stuff in that...

196
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,100
In the dialogue.

197
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,340
If there's a screenshot.

198
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,360
Yeah there's a screenshot of it.

199
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,920
And it's not even the real...

200
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,660
It's not even like an actual app.

201
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,900
This kid made a fucking PNG.

202
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,940
Like he made like a fucking...

203
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,120
He made his own app.

204
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,260
He made his own fucking app.

205
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,980
Like a fake client.

206
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,320
Just to troll people on stream.

207
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,680
Like...

208
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,960
Oh my god.

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,220
You know this is a 15 year old kid.

210
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,300
You fucking know.

211
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,060
This is a 15 year old kid who did that.

212
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,780
A very smart 15 year old kid though.

213
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,860
A very smart one.

214
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,840
But yeah.

215
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
It's actually...

216
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,960
It's actually...

217
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,220
It's actually crazy.

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,680
Uh...

219
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,340
It's actually insane that this happened.

220
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,560
At best if you really do want to be safe.

221
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,840
I guess just don't play Apex at the moment.

222
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
If you're actually like super paranoid.

223
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,040
But I think like...

224
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,880
For it...

225
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,380
Like...

226
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,000
There's no...

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,860
Like I feel like they're just...

228
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,160
He's just targeting like public figures at the moment.

229
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,000
To make a statement regarding the security of EA servers.

230
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,240
Because like...

231
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,300
He's done this before.

232
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,880
And the thing is...

233
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,160
He's been the only hacker that's been doing this.

234
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,980
Other than Toofy.

235
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,280
Before him...

236
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,300
It was Toofy.

237
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,960
And then Toofy got sued to oblivion.

238
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,880
And now...

239
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,260
That's why he's gone.

240
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,340
The reason why Toofy's not here anymore.

241
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,760
Is because he actually got sued.

242
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,760
So like...

243
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,640
Now he's gone.

244
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,400
So now it's this fucking 15 year old kid that's doing all of this.

245
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,260
And he's like...

246
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,720
He's like...

247
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,060
He's like the successor of Toofy.

248
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,960
So...

249
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,600
So that's...

250
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,680
And they always do it for publicity.

251
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,520
Like...

252
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,220
Like the thing is...

253
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,040
I'm not worried.

254
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,580
Because like...

255
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,020
I'm not worried or scared.

256
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,180
Because like...

257
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,360
These people only do it for publicity.

258
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,740
In a way.

259
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,520
Like if he...

260
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,420
They really wanna like fuck people over.

261
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,840
They would not have like told people that they were hacking.

262
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,680
They would just actually do it for publicity.

263
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,900
Just like...

264
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,520
Just like...

265
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,260
Just like not even tell anybody that like...

266
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,860
Like...

267
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,460
Like...

268
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,100
Like he...

269
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,920
They would throw Jen Burden under the bus.

270
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,680
And make people believe that he was actually hacking.

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,660
But he did all of this for publicity.

272
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,240
So that's why I'm not like...

273
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,060
I'm not like worried about it.

274
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,780
Or anything.

275
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,860
And like...

276
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,960
People are still like...

277
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,340
You know...

278
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,640
Like...

279
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,540
If the pros are still playing Apex.

280
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,280
Then they know some...

281
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,360
I know some stuff too.

282
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,100
Then they...

283
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,720
Then...

284
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,660
Then they...

285
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,380
Then they know something we don't.

286
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,000
Because if the pros are still playing Apex rank.

287
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,180
And like they're still playing Apex.

288
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,760
Then they know something that we don't.

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,480
Or...

290
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,520
So...

291
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
So that's why I like...

292
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm not like really worried.

293
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,600
Butch Top.

294
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,540
Thank you for the super chat.

295
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:03,900
Thank you.

296
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,420
Thank you.

297
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,000
15 year old versus indie developer EA.

298
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,980
Thank you for the super chat.

299
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,440
Thank you.

300
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,960
Thank you.

301
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,140
Thank you.

302
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,640
Also like...

303
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

304
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,760
So there's like...

305
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,000
We have a challenger circuit.

306
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,660
I don't know what's gonna be...

307
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,200
Go on.

308
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,680
With that for now.

309
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,500
I don't know what's happening with that.

310
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,380
So like...

311
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,640
It might be delayed.

312
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,680
I don't know.

313
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,860
Because like right now...

314
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,340
All tournaments are at...

315
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,240
Like the...

316
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,640
The pro league is...

317
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,900
Postponed at the moment.

318
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,200
So it might...

319
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,020
Affect...

320
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,920
Challenger circuit.

321
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,820
So...

322
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,860
We don't know.

323
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,520
We don't know.

324
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I'm waiting for like...

325
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,100
An announcement about what's going on and stuff.

326
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,520
So at the moment, I'm just... we're just waiting.

327
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,400
It could be delayed, the challenger circuit at that point.

328
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,260
It could be... it could be delayed.

329
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,360
Anyway, what else?

330
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:48,900
Oh yes!

331
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,840
And also Razer sent me some stuff!

332
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,460
I actually received it recently.

333
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,360
I'm so happy!

334
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,700
I finally have a full keyboard!

335
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,940
When they asked me, they were like, oh hey Doki, do you want a 60%?

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,840
Because you know, I'm known to use 60% keyboards.

337
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,900
Or like 65% keyboards.

338
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,420
And I was like, no I would like a full keyboard.

339
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,120
Because they were like, what size keyboard do you want?

340
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,500
And I was like, do you want 60% or a full?

341
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,700
I was like, a full keyboard.

342
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,780
Because I have zero full keyboards by the way.

343
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,140
All my keyboards are like cut in some way.

344
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,680
They're like... they're like minimal.

345
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,820
Not minimal, what's the word?

346
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,900
They're like... they cut out some keys that I don't normally use.

347
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,580
Because you know, for efficiency sake and for like space wise.

348
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,960
So I was like, no I would like a full keyboard.

349
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,280
I would like a full keyboard for once in my life.

350
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,580
So I finally... so yeah, huge shout out to Razer.

351
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,360
They reached out to me and was like, we really want to send you some gaming gear.

352
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,100
And I was like, me?

353
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,560
For free?

354
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,660
So yeah, I got some...

355
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,740
Free gaming gear.

356
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm so...

357
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,040
This is... it's actually crazy.

358
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,800
Like Skypad and Razer and like...

359
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,180
Many more... he can't say anything.

360
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,580
It's actually crazy.

361
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,200
I've never had this opportunity before.

362
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,240
So I was like, really really surprised.

363
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,300
Because it's like, you know, I thought that like, you know...

364
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,940
I don't know, I just thought I was like a nobody.

365
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,680
Like no one really wanted me to, you know, represent their brand or anything.

366
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,460
Because I never had that opportunity before.

367
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,180
So I was like, really really surprised.

368
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,400
And why would I ever say no to free stuff?

369
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:34,940
You know?

370
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,700
Why would I ever say no to free stuff?

371
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,420
It's free!

372
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,640
Like...

373
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,360
So yeah, it's actually crazy.

374
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,220
There's like so many things that's gonna happen in the future.

375
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,180
Like so many amazing opportunities.

376
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,800
I can't really... I can't say anything about it.

377
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,120
Because like, you know, NDA reasons.

378
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,320
And like when it happens, it happens.

379
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,460
When it's announced, it's announced.

380
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,140
But like, a lot of things definitely to look forward to.

381
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,440
By the way guys, just like, you know, this is just the beginning.

382
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,640
So yeah, anyway.

383
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,560
Today we are gonna fucking play Resident Evil 4.

384
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,900
And I hope to God we can finish this game today.

385
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,580
I hope... I will fucking finish this game today.

386
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh my God, there is like so much...

387
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It might be like fucking...

388
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,460
Six more chapters.

389
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,160
Six more chapters.

390
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,340
But we can do this, I believe.

391
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,060
You guys might be like, but Doki, it's like 3 AM, Doki.

392
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,540
It's time.

393
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,700
It's time.

394
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,440
Tell your... phone in your boss.

395
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,800
And be like, I can't...

396
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,000
Use your sick days.

397
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,280
You have one... I know you have at least one sick day.

398
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,420
But that's a joke.

399
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,240
Please don't like ditch work for me.

400
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,600
Predictable.

401
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,020
Please don't ditch work for me guys.

402
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,380
I...

403
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,840
Because working grants you money.

404
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,280
And by having money, you can pay for internet bills.

405
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,440
And by paying internet bills, you can watch me.

406
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,240
And then by watching me, you support me.

407
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,120
And then to support me, you have to go to work.

408
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,660
And then... yeah, it's a circle.

409
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,240
It's a circle.

410
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,340
Please don't skip work.

411
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,040
Please don't skip work.

412
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,520
Ada?

413
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,520
Assuming you haven't.

414
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,920
I've got a tip for you.

415
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,600
Hello Ada.

416
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,520
Seems like something big is about to go down in the throne room.

417
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,260
The throne room?

418
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Where the fuck is the throne...

419
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,980
Oh my god, I'm so happy I don't have...

420
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,000
Ada!

421
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,180
I don't have to deal with Ashley anymore.

422
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm so fucking happy.

423
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,380
No more Ashley.

424
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,900
Okay, let's see.

425
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,300
What do I have?

426
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,120
Okay, I still have a lot of bullets.

427
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,660
That's good.

428
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,320
Hello!

429
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,400
Hello sir.

430
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,920
I lost Ashley.

431
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,980
Thank fucking god.

432
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,440
Haha.

433
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,400
Alright, let's see.

434
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,180
Do I save up for the upgrade ticket?

435
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,100
Should I save up for the upgrade ticket or should I buy...

436
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,060
No, I should save up.

437
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,260
I should actually save up though.

438
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,640
Let's see.

439
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,760
Striker...

440
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,140
38,000.

441
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,660
How much money?

442
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,220
I do not have a lot of money.

443
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,260
Okay, is the striker good?

444
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,380
Is it worth it?

445
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,100
Is it worth it or nah?

446
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,460
Is it worth it or nah, guys?

447
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,940
This is very important.

448
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,220
Let's see.

449
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,020
1, 2, 3...

450
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,480
No?

451
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,420
Okay, no.

452
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,800
Okay, I won't use the striker then.

453
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,100
Alright, here we go.

454
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,180
Haha.

455
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,240
Nexy, thank you for the super chat.

456
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:37,660
Thank you.

457
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,080
Thank you.

458
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,220
Watching from work right now so I can afford super chats.

459
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,080
You know what's an even bigger brain play?

460
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,440
Work so hard that you get promoted.

461
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,380
So...

462
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,160
Hahaha.

463
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,300
Hahaha.

464
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,740
Hahaha.

465
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,500
Work so hard that you can get promoted.

466
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,640
And then by being promoted, you can watch me more.

467
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,180
And support me more.

468
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,840
That's a big brain play, guys.

469
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,240
Cal, thank you for the Akasupa.

470
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,660
Thank you.

471
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,380
Watch Doki while working.

472
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,740
Infinite Doki glitch.

473
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,180
Thank you for the Akasupa.

474
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,680
Thank you.

475
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,420
Alright, where do I have to go?

476
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,140
Okay, I have to go through...

477
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,960
Let's see.

478
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,820
Is there any like missions I need to do?

479
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,980
Can you go...

480
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,180
Oh, I need to go through that room.

481
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,200
Alright.

482
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,260
Is it this room, right?

483
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,280
This is the room I opened.

484
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,820
Yeah, this is my room I opened.

485
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,480
What's this?

486
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,340
Oh, the emerald.

487
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,760
Nice.

488
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,260
Free shit.

489
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,680
I love free shit.

490
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:41,860
Uh...

491
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,780
Where the fuck is this room?

492
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,380
Wait, where do I have to go?

493
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,300
Okay, the throne.

494
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,200
Oh, I have to go there for the throne room.

495
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,260
Which means...

496
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,940
I just have to go there.

497
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm a secret brave soul willing to dispose of that monstrosity of a knight.

498
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,180
But B Warren is much stronger than the others.

499
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
He cut down our best with a single strike.

500
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,280
It's okay.

501
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,520
I have a flashbang.

502
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,580
Do I have a flashbang?

503
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,920
I do not have a flashbang.

504
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,140
Amelia, thank you for the Akasupa.

505
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,580
Thank you.

506
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,060
If I don't go to work, then I can't send you Akasupas though.

507
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,100
So what is the real solution here?

508
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,180
You go to work.

509
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,720
I don't know what else I'm supposed to tell you.

510
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,520
Oh, I do have a flashbang.

511
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,620
You go to work.

512
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,480
Like, what do you want me to say?

513
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,500
Oh, no.

514
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,740
Not the dark.

515
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

516
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,620
Is this the...

517
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,680
Is this the library?

518
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,710
Is this the fucking...

519
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,730
Am I heading to the library?

520
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,830
No, this is the library.

521
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,310
Okay.

522
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,690
This is the...

523
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,330
What is this?

524
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,010
Is this the...

525
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,830
Oh, this is the knight.

526
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,990
Okay, now it's dark.

527
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,590
It's okay.

528
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:47,950
I have a gun.

529
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,170
I'm not as scared.

530
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,690
I'm not as scared, guys.

531
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,570
I have a gun.

532
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,490
I'm not as scared.

533
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,070
I have gun.

534
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,970
Wait, how do I get this?

535
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,290
There's, like...

536
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,450
Is this above me?

537
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,010
Okay, this is the second floor.

538
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,830
Okay.

539
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,310
I have gun.

540
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,190
I have gun.

541
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,930
I'm not as scared.

542
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,490
I have gun.

543
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,810
I have gun.

544
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,690
Where are you?

545
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,230
Where are you?

546
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,670
I know you're here.

547
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,850
Oh, this is it.

548
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,050
This is the Ashley room.

549
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,470
Okay, gun is always the answer.

550
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:25,690
Alright.

551
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,810
Where are you?

552
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,610
I have gun, you can't fuck with me this time!

553
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,050
Where are you?

554
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,930
I know you're here!

555
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,010
I know you're here because I screamed when I was in here!

556
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,070
That's why I know!

557
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,130
Alright, actually... okay, this is where the knight is.

558
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,670
Alright.

559
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,250
I have an overdue book.

560
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,930
I would go to the library to just rent out VeggieTales.

561
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,390
That was like the only time I ever go to the library.

562
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:10,710
I only ever went to the library to rent the Arthur PC games and the VeggieTales potatoes.

563
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,490
Oh, the third rat!

564
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,310
Where's the third rat?

565
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,430
Guys, where's the third rat?

566
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,470
I forgot about the rat.

567
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,470
Is it above here?

568
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,450
VeggieTales, VeggieTales, VeggieTales.

569
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,130
Broccoli, celery, ba-ba-dum.

570
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,050
I always forget that VeggieTales was like super fucking religious.

571
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,590
I just thought they were funny veggies.

572
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,850
They were just funny veggies to me.

573
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,650
Back in the hall.

574
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,850
Oh, it's in the animal heads.

575
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,250
You're just silly little vegetables.

576
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,010
Where the fuck?

577
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,550
Oh, there you are.

578
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,970
Stop running.

579
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,050
Stop running!

580
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,710
Oh my god!

581
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,090
Stop!

582
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,390
Stop!

583
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,250
There you go.

584
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,470
I did it.

585
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,290
The rat exterminator is here.

586
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:13,630
Yeah, like, did you guys know they fired the creat- They fired the creators of VeggieTales.

587
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,930
Not very Christian of them to do.

588
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,690
But that's what they did.

589
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,390
Yeah.

590
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:29,750
Yeah, it's not very- Show up on like Christian values and then they fired the creators.

591
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,210
Like, what the fuck?

592
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,890
Don't- Thank you for the super chat.

593
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,250
Thank you.

594
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:35,670
Thank you.

595
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,210
I should do listen to Doki while working.

596
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,950
Sadly, I can't always pay full attention to you.

597
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,590
But I tried.

598
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,190
Thank you for the super chat.

599
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:41,510
Thank you.

600
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,910
Thank you.

601
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,350
That's alright.

602
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,510
As long as like you're still supporting me in your own way.

603
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,910
Oh, that has to be.

604
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,970
That has to be the merciless knight.

605
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,050
He seems pretty fucking big.

606
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,030
Doki recognizes no god.

607
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,670
Only Larry.

608
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,050
Thank you for the super chat, Matty.

609
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,530
Thank you.

610
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,090
Thank you.

611
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,070
Alright.

612
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:00,950
Big boy.

613
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,670
Hello, big boy.

614
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,210
Hello, big boy.

615
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,270
That is our big boy.

616
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,070
Wait, they can run now?

617
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,810
What the fuck?

618
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,670
It's okay.

619
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,850
It's okay.

620
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:13,950
It's okay!

621
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,510
Yike!

622
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:15,570
Woooo!

623
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,850
It's okay!

624
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,450
Kick!

625
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,370
And then run!

626
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,350
And then I...

627
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,690
Oh, how am I missing?

628
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,310
How am I missing?

629
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,050
Okay.

630
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,570
This is like fucked up a little bit because it's so fucking dark!

631
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,600
What the fuck is so fa- This is a little bit harder.

632
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,700
I just realized how dark this is.

633
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,360
Oh god.

634
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,900
It's okay.

635
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,420
I need to get all of them out of the little hidey hole.

636
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,700
Fuck!

637
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,180
It's okay.

638
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,720
Kick!

639
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,720
Come on!

640
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,660
Get out of your little hidey hole!

641
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,160
Wait, what?

642
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:00,860
Oh!

643
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,280
Oh, I didn't see him!

644
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,100
I didn't see him!

645
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,620
I didn't see him!

646
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

647
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:08,940
Okay.

648
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,280
Please.

649
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,120
Please.

650
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,040
Please, it's so dark.

651
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,320
Please, it's so fucking dark.

652
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,360
I cannot see!

653
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,140
I cannot see!

654
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:22,920
Ah!

655
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,720
Shit!

656
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,600
It's okay!

657
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,700
It's okay!

658
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,880
Alright, okay, okay, I'm gonna use the shotgun.

659
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,460
Everything...

660
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,300
Everything shows up in the shotgun!

661
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,360
But let me kill you first.

662
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,280
Alright.

663
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,200
Oh god.

664
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,540
All the pellets!

665
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,200
Oh!

666
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,680
Shit!

667
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,680
Okay.

668
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,380
I'm just hoping all the pellets come out.

669
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,240
There we go.

670
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,420
There we go.

671
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,900
That's fine!

672
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,620
That's fine!

673
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,360
Flashbang!

674
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,440
Boom.

675
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,260
No, no, no, no, that's not the flashbang!

676
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,000
You should be dead now.

677
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,060
There we go.

678
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:01,840
Easy.

679
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,760
So fucking easy.

680
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,660
Alright!

681
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,560
There you go.

682
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,580
We're fine.

683
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,420
I don't think all of these guys are gonna try and kill me, so we'll be fine.

684
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,040
And this is what the fish is for.

685
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:14,780
Fish!

686
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,680
Fish time!

687
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,840
Do I need to go here?

688
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Do I need to?

689
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,880
I don't, right?

690
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,920
Pretty sure I don't.

691
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,240
I think I killed everything here.

692
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,640
I grabbed the loot there before.

693
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,100
Thank you for the gift of the ship!

694
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,440
Thank you!

695
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,280
No?

696
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,480
I'm pretty sure I got the...

697
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,660
Oh, I can?

698
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,160
Alright.

699
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,100
That was just for bonus mission.

700
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,580
Alright, nice.

701
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,380
We're good.

702
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,340
We're good to go.

703
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,540
We got loot for the merchant.

704
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,920
There you go.

705
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,400
That's fine.

706
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,420
There is a gun in the library?

707
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,360
Where the fuck is that gun?

708
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,040
Yeah, thank you for the super chat!

709
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,340
Thank you!

710
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,120
Thank you for the love of everything to made a press alt on that inventory.

711
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,660
No.

712
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,620
No.

713
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,420
No.

714
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,640
I hope this pisses you off even more.

715
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,660
No.

716
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,580
No.

717
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,340
I don't need AI to help me sort my inventory.

718
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,240
I don't need it.

719
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,300
I have...

720
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,720
I have my own skill.

721
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,440
Okay.

722
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,900
I want to go back to grab some stuff from the merchant.

723
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,200
I'm a gamer!

724
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,580
I'm not gonna let AI sort my guns!

725
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,140
Alright, this way.

726
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,260
I'm gonna go sell my stuff.

727
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,360
This is my order.

728
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,980
This is the Doki order.

729
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,200
It's art.

730
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,040
You won't understand.

731
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,540
Yay!

732
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,940
Wait, I got two.

733
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,200
Oh yeah, I got the rats too!

734
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,600
Wait, can I have enough?

735
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,300
Fuck!

736
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
I'm like one short.

737
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,060
Are you kidding me?

738
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,360
I'm like one short.

739
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,280
Okay.

740
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,160
I might as well like...

741
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,520
do this too.

742
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,520
Uhhhh...

743
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,940
Yeah, two of the same color.

744
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,720
I might as well.

745
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:20,940
Okay.

746
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,780
Uhhhh... yes!

747
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,260
And then... yes!

748
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,620
Alright, and this one needs one, two, three.

749
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,700
I don't think I'm gonna get three of a kind.

750
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,080
Oh, I wasn't even gonna have three of a kind.

751
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:33,960
Anyway.

752
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,600
Alright, we're gonna sell you.

753
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:36,900
Yay!

754
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,040
Time to save.

755
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,640
Save game.

756
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,600
Alright.

757
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,980
We need to...

758
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,940
We need to go back to the library anyway.

759
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,060
Sorry, extra loot.

760
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,940
Loot time.

761
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,680
Gonna reload my shotgun.

762
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,340
Alright!

763
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,000
It's time to go in and kill some more knights.

764
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,140
Open up!

765
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,980
I went the wrong way.

766
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,500
Okay.

767
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,220
Alright.

768
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,840
Time to go back this way.

769
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,060
And grab some more loot.

770
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,740
Alright.

771
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,520
We gotta grab that rifle.

772
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,340
Is that rifle even good or is it just a selling rifle?

773
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,160
Is that rifle just like money rifle?

774
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,860
It's just for money, right?

775
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,120
Oh god, I hate this.

776
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,880
I hate that it's still so dark.

777
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
Someone turn on the fucking lights.

778
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,380
I know you're here.

779
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,840
Like, I know you exist.

780
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,820
I know you're here.

781
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,500
Come on.

782
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,060
Walk over here, please.

783
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,480
Just walk over here.

784
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,820
Oh, there you are.

785
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,120
Thank you.

786
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,840
Thank you for walking over.

787
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,800
I really appreciate that.

788
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,800
You guys just walk over, please.

789
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,620
Thank you.

790
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,640
Where's the other one?

791
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,480
Wait, are they not gonna walk over?

792
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,600
Are they stuck?

793
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,280
No, this guy's walking over.

794
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,740
Thank you.

795
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,230
I really appreciate that, sir.

796
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,930
You get closer, you're way too far from me.

797
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,130
There we go.

798
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,270
Boom!

799
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,250
Alright.

800
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,770
Can you get closer?

801
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,590
It's convenient!

802
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,470
I don't wanna waste my energy!

803
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,670
Walk closer.

804
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,950
Okay, I know you're to my right.

805
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,730
There you are.

806
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,070
You get a little closer.

807
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,710
Oh my god, the fucking statue.

808
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,230
Okay, I think I hit him, right?

809
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,110
Okay, I don't know.

810
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:50,770
Guys!

811
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,390
You get a little closer.

812
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,450
Nice, thank you.

813
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,730
Thank you.

814
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,070
It's nice because I don't have to waste my energy.

815
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,410
You get a little bit closer.

816
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,630
Thank you.

817
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,410
Efficiency!

818
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,210
I love efficiency.

819
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,470
Alright, where is that fucking chest?

820
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,490
How many crows has Doki killed?

821
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,790
Not as much as I would like, even though they owe me so much money.

822
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,390
Wait, I don't even have the key.

823
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:24,670
No!

824
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,150
I forgot to...

825
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,590
Ashley, you were supposed to unlock this!

826
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,870
Why couldn't you drop the key when you were getting kidnapped?

827
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,430
Ashley, how could you?

828
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,910
Ashley didn't drop the keys when she was getting kidnapped.

829
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,590
So inefficient, Ashley.

830
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,910
So fucking inefficient.

831
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,450
Okay, this has to be the fucking...

832
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,670
Okay, this has to be the...

833
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:54,630
Uh...

834
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,390
This has to be the...

835
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,030
What is it?

836
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,150
The...

837
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,570
Okay, I think this is it.

838
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:00,750
No.

839
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,970
The rifle.

840
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,130
Uh...

841
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,530
Is this how you do it?

842
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:05,810
Nope.

843
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,770
Nope, not this way.

844
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,410
Okay, I think this is it.

845
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,010
Is it this one?

846
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,070
Nope.

847
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,310
Uh...

848
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,350
Oh, it's a square!

849
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,050
No...

850
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,310
Is it like this?

851
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,770
I keep putting...

852
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,210
Oh, here!

853
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:22,770
I did it.

854
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,510
I'm so smart.

855
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:28,930
Yay!

856
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:31,790
Okay.

857
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,030
Fuck, okay.

858
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,290
God damn it.

859
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,310
Now I actually have it to inventory manage.

860
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:37,950
God damn it.

861
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:38,390
I can't find it.

862
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,070
I can't believe it.

863
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,570
I let them win.

864
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,970
I hope you're happy, guys.

865
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,670
Now I actually have to inventory manage.

866
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:50,910
Uh...

867
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,530
There, are you happy now?

868
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,310
You can tell I play Tetris.

869
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,080
That is the Tetris brain going on.

870
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,200
Alright, now I can sell this.

871
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:09,960
Finally.

872
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,140
Finally.

873
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
Anything for Gun.

874
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,920
I know what game to start for next week.

875
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,700
Because we do have a lot of Steam games.

876
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,080
Oh my God!

877
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,840
I know what game I want to start next week after we finish Resident Evil 4.

878
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,660
I want to finally play Dead Rise.

879
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,080
I know!

880
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,420
It's like, Doki, you bought so many new games on your Steam sale.

881
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,200
Guys!

882
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,780
But what about Dead Rise?

883
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,240
I don't understand.

884
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,180
What these guys are thinking.

885
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,780
I see...

886
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,800
Guys, just think about that!

887
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,220
Which gun did I just brought?

888
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,920
Guys wait.

889
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,900
Which gun did I...

890
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,400
Okay, is this.

891
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,480
Is this a good gun?

892
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,040
Or not?

893
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,440
Ugly, thank you for the superchat.

894
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,540
How did you manage to escape a dungeon?

895
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,900
Is this a.

896
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,420
Is this a good gun or not?

897
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,420
Don't sell it.

898
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:05,700
Why?

899
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,880
Why though?

900
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,120
Is it actually good?

901
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,760
I don't know.

902
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,640
Guys, I have so many guns!

903
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,800
Guys!

904
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:21,880
I have so many guns, guys!

905
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,600
Little to no damage?

906
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,100
Okay, I'm selling it.

907
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,460
Alright, I'll sell the rifle.

908
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
It's too late.

909
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,640
It's too late.

910
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,500
I'm selling it.

911
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,060
Say 07.

912
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,640
It's time to 07 this.

913
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,800
Goodbye!

914
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,060
Alright, let's see.

915
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,240
I'll save my game.

916
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm gonna save here just in case.

917
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,960
Just in case I did make a mistake.

918
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,800
Just in case.

919
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,280
Alright, let's see.

920
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,720
Now we can progress the level!

921
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,840
Alright.

922
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,600
Oh yeah.

923
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,420
I just want to be a journalist.

924
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,280
I've covered wars, you know.

925
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,380
Uh... Alright.

926
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,020
Dead Rising is actually... What the are you?!

927
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,620
What?!

928
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,540
Chink!

929
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,140
Chink!

930
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,680
Chink!

931
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,620
What?!

932
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,580
Oh my god!

933
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
There's bugs?!

934
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,900
I just realized I never got this far.

935
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,020
I've never got this far!

936
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,720
Alright.

937
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,080
This is locked.

938
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,920
Where do I go?

939
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,180
How do I get there?

940
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
Do I jump down?

941
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,800
Oh, there.

942
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,100
There.

943
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,340
There.

944
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,220
I can't believe it.

945
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:50,720
Mothmen.

946
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,490
Oh god.

947
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,910
Jesus Christ.

948
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,250
I can't even loot them.

949
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,590
That's the worst part!

950
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,090
I can't even loot these fuckers!

951
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,210
Oh, God, please tell me there's ammo here.

952
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,510
Oh, thank God.

953
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:11,830
Okay.

954
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,130
At least there's ammo for me here.

955
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,930
Oh, I need that.

956
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,910
I need that so badly.

957
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,850
I was running out of handgun ammo too.

958
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,970
Oh, thank God I'm on normal!

959
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,770
Thank fucking God.

960
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,130
I appreciate the simple things.

961
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,410
Being on normal difficulty so I have loot.

962
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,770
Thank fucking God.

963
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,690
The true horror.

964
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,670
Oh, but thank you for the super chat.

965
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,130
Thank you.

966
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,810
Thank you to keep planning the cover wars, you know.

967
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,010
That's right.

968
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,550
It's time to be a journalist.

969
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,950
So I'm excused to play on journalism.

970
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,950
Journalist mode.

971
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,330
Black liquid into the body.

972
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,590
Or at the precipice of success.

973
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,410
The womb is the key.

974
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,550
A pure soul proves to be a highly malleable and adaptive subject.

975
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,750
He's talking about me!

976
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,910
I'm so pure.

977
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,410
January.

978
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,090
Six years since my awakening.

979
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:48,210
I've named the sacred larvae carried in the womb of the chosen after my own.

980
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,310
They shall carry the prestige of my family name.

981
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,190
Oh, the U2!

982
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:00,510
Are they gonna be playing in the...

983
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,210
What was it?

984
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:01,770
In the globe.

985
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,590
Not Bono!

986
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,850
Thank you for the super chat!

987
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:54,210
Thank you!

988
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,050
Pure evil you mean.

989
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,850
Oh, he's talking about the red guys!

990
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,410
Those are the red rope guys!

991
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,570
Because they were like buggy.

992
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,910
Next form of evolution.

993
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,490
Return to bug.

994
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,970
Honestly, I feel like bugs are like pretty...

995
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,330
Pretty like...

996
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,370
What is it?

997
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,790
What's the word?

998
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,870
They're pretty like hardcore.

999
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,470
In the evolution.

1000
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,190
Evolution line.

1001
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,030
Because they like...

1002
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,470
There's like...

1003
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,950
You know, like some bugs they can't fucking die.

1004
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,830
Because they have like hard exoskeletons.

1005
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,350
And then they like...

1006
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,770
Breed like crazy.

1007
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:36,610
So they can like produce like thousands and millions of insects at once.

1008
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,070
Like the queen can just lay a thousand fucking insects and stuff.

1009
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,070
And it's like what?

1010
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,670
And then like their ta...

1011
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,430
Okay, they're not...

1012
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,490
They're like strong too.

1013
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,130
Like ants, they can like hold up like...

1014
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,030
Times ten their fucking...

1015
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,450
Body weight and stuff.

1016
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,870
And they're pretty resilient.

1017
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,290
Yeah.

1018
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,530
So like in a way, they are sort of like better than humans.

1019
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:03,050
If they were like human size, I would be very fucking scared about a human-sized insect.

1020
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:03,790
Like...

1021
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,950
That's the only thing there's...

1022
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,390
That...

1023
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,590
That's the only thing that's stopping them.

1024
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,410
They're just too fucking tiny.

1025
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,350
If they were bigger...

1026
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,590
If they were bigger, then they would be like scary.

1027
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,210
They would actually be like really fucking scary.

1028
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:22,850
They're...

1029
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,990
We're just lucky that they're so fucking tiny.

1030
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:26,750
Honestly.

1031
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,290
They will collapse?

1032
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,010
You don't know that.

1033
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,530
They're fucking buff as hell.

1034
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,510
Wait, where did...

1035
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,670
No!

1036
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,410
He dropped into the fucking hole!

1037
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,410
Stupid bug.

1038
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,130
Wait, I hear them.

1039
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,570
Come on.

1040
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,090
Oh my god, the reload.

1041
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:49,870
Okay, stab.

1042
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,110
There's always an end.

1043
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,450
That's why I'm not afraid.

1044
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,470
Oh, fuck!

1045
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,740
Holy shit!

1046
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,020
Give me a sec!

1047
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,540
I didn't...

1048
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,020
I didn't think there'd be more!

1049
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,660
I thought there'd be an end!

1050
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,180
Okay.

1051
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,880
Oh shit!

1052
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,500
You fucking stupid bug!

1053
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,860
I'm gonna stab you.

1054
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:22,960
Stab.

1055
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,700
Aim for the eyes?

1056
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,400
Which one?

1057
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,060
I don't know if you guys know this, but bugs have a lot of eyes.

1058
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,900
Oh, thank god.

1059
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,200
There's a lot of handgun ammo.

1060
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,720
Thank fucking god.

1061
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,280
Okay.

1062
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,340
Let's see.

1063
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,960
There is a lot of gear here.

1064
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,140
I have to go this way.

1065
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,400
All of them?

1066
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,820
That's one.

1067
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,420
One too many.

1068
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,460
That's one too many.

1069
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,920
Okay, that's fucking right.

1070
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,240
You can't fucking fool me.

1071
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,780
I know a bug when I see one.

1072
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,760
How the fuck do I get there?

1073
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,260
Okay, not that.

1074
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,720
Not you!

1075
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,800
Except for you.

1076
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,700
Just in case.

1077
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:14,780
Up.

1078
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,180
Okay.

1079
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,800
I know there's one more somewhere.

1080
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,800
Aim for the lower left.

1081
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,020
Second.

1082
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:25,940
From the third.

1083
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,960
From the last row.

1084
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,900
I'm gonna chat!

1085
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,080
This is fucked up.

1086
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,300
This is fucked up.

1087
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,700
What the fuck?

1088
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,740
I'm just gonna stab you.

1089
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,100
I'm gonna stab.

1090
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:39,920
That's fucking right.

1091
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,040
I'm gonna stab you.

1092
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,220
That's fucking right.

1093
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,680
What are you gonna do?

1094
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,220
That's fucking right.

1095
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,020
What are you gonna do?

1096
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,140
That's fucking right!

1097
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,260
That's right!

1098
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:47,980
Get stabbed!

1099
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,100
Everyone gets one.

1100
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,040
Okay.

1101
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,220
Okay.

1102
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,060
I'm looking this time.

1103
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,260
Okay, I'm making sure...

1104
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,280
I'm making sure I'm safe.

1105
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,280
Alright, I got a hand grenade.

1106
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,340
I know there's like- I'm missing a loot here somewhere.

1107
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,520
Where the fuck is it?

1108
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,260
Welcome to London again.

1109
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,060
Oh, there it is.

1110
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,400
Right in front of me.

1111
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,520
Alright, I need a heal.

1112
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,860
I'm so fucked up.

1113
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,760
I'm so fucked up.

1114
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,540
I'm gonna eat the fish.

1115
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,580
Wait, actually- Oh, wait, I am fucked up.

1116
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,080
Okay.

1117
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,720
I'm gonna eat the fish.

1118
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,200
I was pretty fucked up.

1119
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,360
Let's see, which way do I go?

1120
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,820
What is that over here?

1121
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
There's treasure over here.

1122
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,080
I'm gonna go this way for the treasure.

1123
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,960
Always for the loot.

1124
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,200
What the fuck is crawling?

1125
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,740
Come on, that's right.

1126
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,280
That's fucking right, you can't fool me.

1127
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,000
That's fucking right.

1128
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,040
Stab you.

1129
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,020
Stab!

1130
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,380
Stab!

1131
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:56,700
Woo!

1132
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,040
There you go.

1133
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,020
Can't fool me this time.

1134
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:01,800
Stab!

1135
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,340
Nice.

1136
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,120
Free loot.

1137
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:06,980
Free loot.

1138
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,380
Oh!

1139
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,260
Woo!

1140
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:09,980
No!

1141
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:10,400
No!

1142
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,700
Oh, thank god.

1143
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,260
Okay, okay, okay.

1144
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,480
Okay.

1145
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,260
Alright, I was a little worried.

1146
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,400
Wait.

1147
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,640
I'm gonna stab the people behind me.

1148
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,340
I hear you.

1149
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,060
I fucking knew it.

1150
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,960
Fucking knew it.

1151
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,180
I knew you were there.

1152
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,580
I knew you were there.

1153
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,260
Let me stab you.

1154
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm gonna stab you too.

1155
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm gonna stab you.

1156
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,120
That's fucking right.

1157
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,840
No!

1158
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,360
Wait!

1159
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,840
Wait, that broke my knife?

1160
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,100
Oh, I broke my knife.

1161
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,380
Guys.

1162
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,500
I think I stabbed a little bit too much, guys.

1163
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,860
Just a little bit too much.

1164
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,360
It's okay.

1165
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,600
I have my kitchen knife though.

1166
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,740
I still have my kitchen knife.

1167
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,020
I still have my kitchen knife.

1168
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,100
It's okay.

1169
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,860
I got the kitchen knife.

1170
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,580
What can they do about it?

1171
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,980
Alright, let's grab this.

1172
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,200
And then... chest time.

1173
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,460
Oh, nice.

1174
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,100
Money.

1175
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,500
I love money.

1176
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,840
How do I get over there?

1177
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:12,740
Please.

1178
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,240
I just wanna loot.

1179
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,700
I just wanna loot.

1180
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,500
I forgot to upgrade my knife.

1181
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:19,760
Please.

1182
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,000
Okay, we need a...

1183
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,900
Let me open this.

1184
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:24,920
Open?

1185
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,280
Open!

1186
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,420
Shortcut!

1187
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,100
Yay!

1188
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,660
Is this a shortcut?

1189
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,320
Yay!

1190
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,800
I'm gonna go back.

1191
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,720
I'm gonna go back.

1192
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,020
We need to fix my knife.

1193
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,440
How else am I gonna be stabbing some bugs?

1194
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,300
Alright, this way.

1195
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,920
This way.

1196
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,360
Merchant!

1197
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,040
I need you to fix my knife.

1198
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,280
I stabbed one too many bugs.

1199
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,400
I love shortcuts.

1200
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,160
Tune up.

1201
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:58,900
Repair.

1202
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,380
Good luck to you, sir.

1203
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:00,940
Uhhh...

1204
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,020
Oh my god.

1205
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,880
I have no armor.

1206
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:04,620
Okay.

1207
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:05,780
Uh...

1208
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:10,820
I might as well upgrade the power and the durability here.

1209
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,600
I feel like...

1210
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,800
I feel like I'm gonna be using this a lot.

1211
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,320
I stabbed one too many bugs.

1212
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,380
Okay.

1213
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,020
It's okay.

1214
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,340
Equip.

1215
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:21,740
Yeah.

1216
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,280
That's right.

1217
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,520
This has to be... Oh!

1218
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,300
I go the right way.

1219
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:25,560
This way.

1220
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,100
Alright.

1221
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,200
Here we go.

1222
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:30,880
Back.

1223
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,340
Here we go.

1224
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,540
Oh shit!

1225
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,120
Forgot to upgrade!

1226
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh my god!

1227
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,500
The only reason I had to come back!

1228
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,180
I forgot to upgrade.

1229
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,020
Oh, I almost forgot.

1230
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:44,460
Alright.

1231
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,380
Trade.

1232
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,220
Nice.

1233
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,480
Finally!

1234
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,340
How do I upgrade this?

1235
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,240
A hundred thousand dollars?!

1236
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,200
Alright.

1237
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,560
How much money do I have?

1238
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,300
Oh!

1239
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,080
Why did I upgrade the knife?!

1240
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,240
Why did you guys stop me?!

1241
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,800
Why did you not stop me?!

1242
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,280
Okay.

1243
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,000
We're gonna... Well, we have like so many of these.

1244
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,240
Three of a kind.

1245
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,200
Alright.

1246
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,840
Here we go.

1247
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,020
Oh!

1248
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,280
It's the money or the ticket?

1249
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,200
Oh, okay.

1250
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:19,320
That's it.

1251
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:19,660
That's good.

1252
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,980
I can just use the ticket!

1253
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:21,940
Okay.

1254
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,480
Two and up.

1255
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,840
I can just use the ticket!

1256
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:24,200
Oh!

1257
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,020
I almost did the knife.

1258
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,680
That would've been so embarrassing.

1259
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,640
That would've been so fucking awkward.

1260
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:34,660
Yay!

1261
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,620
Alright.

1262
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,880
Let me sell the hornet and the butterfly lamp.

1263
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,940
And then we should be good.

1264
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,380
Imagine though...

1265
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,880
And then it turns into a knife only run.

1266
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,480
But the amount of money I spent on that fucking knife...

1267
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,900
It's gonna turn into a knife only run.

1268
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:00,820
Alright.

1269
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,500
Back in we go.

1270
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,440
Neil, thank you for the super chat.

1271
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:06,740
Thank you.

1272
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:12,160
Bugs can't be human sized because the oxygen density in the air is too low to support them.

1273
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,000
Thank you for the super chat.

1274
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,380
Thank you.

1275
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,440
You're right.

1276
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,900
This is why we have global...

1277
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,620
To prevent the size of the bugs from growing bigger.

1278
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,940
It's a risk.

1279
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,100
Either fuck the environment or...

1280
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,380
Yeah.

1281
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,560
The environment is fucked.

1282
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,780
But...

1283
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,300
The bugs are smaller now.

1284
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,380
Guys, think about it.

1285
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,840
Just think about it, chat.

1286
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,760
Yeah.

1287
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,600
We might have fucked...

1288
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,800
Like we might have fucked over the world.

1289
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,620
But now we don't have to deal with like giant sized bugs.

1290
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,660
It's worth it.

1291
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,960
It's worth it.

1292
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,860
Don't keep... please.

1293
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,340
The priorities.

1294
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:06,840
Alright.

1295
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,120
We gotta go this way.

1296
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,840
Where are the bugs?

1297
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,000
I don't like this.

1298
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,280
This seems too bug free.

1299
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,600
I don't like how...

1300
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:17,900
Wait.

1301
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:18,500
Wait.

1302
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:18,660
No.

1303
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,580
This is where I came from.

1304
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,200
Sorry.

1305
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:20,940
I went the wrong way.

1306
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:21,800
I...

1307
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,520
Wait.

1308
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:22,820
Wait.

1309
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,080
Doki goes the wrong way again.

1310
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,240
Yay!

1311
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,420
It's this way.

1312
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,480
This should be the right way, right?

1313
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,360
It might be going the same way again.

1314
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,300
Or was that the right way?

1315
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:38,880
I can't.

1316
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,700
I'm just way too...

1317
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,040
Oh no.

1318
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,200
No.

1319
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:40,720
I've never been here.

1320
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,400
Because there's a box.

1321
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,160
I know I haven't been here because there's a box there.

1322
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,840
I don't like how...

1323
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,340
I don't like how bug free this area is though.

1324
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,800
There we go.

1325
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,360
I fucking knew it.

1326
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,620
Give me a sec.

1327
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,440
Melee!

1328
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,080
That's fucking right.

1329
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,840
Stab!

1330
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,480
Nice.

1331
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,900
Alright.

1332
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,580
Where's the other bug?

1333
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,240
Where's the other bug?

1334
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:07,960
I saw you.

1335
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,480
I know you exist.

1336
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:11,900
Oh shit.

1337
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,040
What the fuck?

1338
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:15,840
There we go.

1339
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,980
Where the fuck are you?

1340
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:18,740
Where are you?

1341
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:19,960
Closer.

1342
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,040
Oh fuck!

1343
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,000
But not that close!

1344
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:26,610
Not that close!

1345
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,590
Oh fuck.

1346
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:28,950
Okay.

1347
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,530
Fuck you.

1348
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:30,990
There we go.

1349
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:35,730
I know I should like actually shoot them because that was a waste of my health.

1350
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,430
But like it was worth it.

1351
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:37,570
Look.

1352
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,650
I spent a lot of money upgrading this knife.

1353
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,370
Chat.

1354
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,850
A lot of money was spent on this knife.

1355
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:43,250
I'm gonna use that knife.

1356
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,130
Okay.

1357
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,850
We can put this together.

1358
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,050
We just need yellow herbs.

1359
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,070
Why is yellow herb so fucking hard to find?

1360
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:52,230
I don't understand.

1361
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:54,730
It's like yellow.

1362
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:58,470
Like...

1363
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,790
That should already be easy.

1364
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,710
It's literally yellow.

1365
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,870
You're the 1% who upgrades dude.

1366
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:12,430
No!

1367
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,550
I'm pretty sure there's more people that upgrades their knives.

1368
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,350
Oh that's a big one.

1369
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,390
That took two shots to kill.

1370
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,370
There's no way.

1371
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,810
I can't be.

1372
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,330
There has to be speedrunners.

1373
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:31,210
Speedrunners can't be the 1%.

1374
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,350
There's no way.

1375
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:36,090
There's an entire fucking charity event dedicated to them.

1376
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,990
It's like at least 2%.

1377
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,770
Guys.

1378
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,810
At least 2%.

1379
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:42,590
Yay.

1380
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:44,510
AHHH!

1381
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:45,310
SHIT!

1382
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:46,790
HOLY SHIT.

1383
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,570
He just slapped me!

1384
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:50,390
Okay.

1385
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:50,870
We're definitely.

1386
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,310
We're definitely gonna need a heal now.

1387
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,470
I'm gonna use the sprint.

1388
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:01,330
Alright.

1389
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,930
Here we go.

1390
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,290
Is this the door I opened?

1391
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:04,790
No.

1392
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,090
Where the fuck did I open?

1393
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,710
Which gate?

1394
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:13,950
Oh, it's over here.

1395
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:14,310
Okay.

1396
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:16,530
This is the gate I open.

1397
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,610
This is... no, this is...

1398
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,290
Okay.

1399
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,090
There's a ladder?

1400
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,250
Oh, it's this way.

1401
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:31,510
Alright.

1402
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,750
No, we're not lost, guys.

1403
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,450
We're never lost.

1404
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,170
We're not lost, guys.

1405
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,790
I just need to go up a ladder.

1406
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,870
Okay, that's a bug.

1407
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:47,850
I can tell.

1408
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,030
I can fucking tell that's a bug.

1409
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:52,690
Alright.

1410
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,010
Gate time!

1411
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,390
Alright, that should be both gates.

1412
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,930
Trust the process.

1413
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,610
You just have to keep trusting.

1414
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,190
Oh, drop down.

1415
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,390
Drop down!

1416
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,150
Alright, now...

1417
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:09,370
Nice.

1418
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,250
More handgun ammo.

1419
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,210
That's really good that they dropped this.

1420
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,650
It's like modern bug spray.

1421
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,830
I'm not shooting the fucking thing again.

1422
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,680
Yeah, I just have a gun.

1423
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,080
I'm a better version of a knight.

1424
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,670
Wait, was that it?

1425
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,970
Bro, this could have been a text message.

1426
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:46,930
Bro, you could have texted me this.

1427
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:54,530
Don't you hate it when people just call you to give you like one sentence of a message?

1428
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,750
Bro, you're wasting my data.

1429
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:00,130
Alright.

1430
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,170
What do you mean this part?

1431
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:04,670
Why are you giving me so much ammo?

1432
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:06,210
Hmm.

1433
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,230
This could have been an email.

1434
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:11,470
Honestly, true.

1435
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,630
I hate getting into like calls for meetings.

1436
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:17,110
I'm just like, can't you just text me this?

1437
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:17,570
Like...

1438
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,910
Fucking hate it.

1439
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,470
Why is there a yellow over there?

1440
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,110
Oh, it's this.

1441
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:26,330
Okay.

1442
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,490
That's one of them.

1443
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,030
That's so true though.

1444
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:33,310
Like, just fucking text me.

1445
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:34,950
You do not need me there.

1446
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,650
Oh my god, where the fuck is the other one?

1447
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,550
Where the fuck is the other one?

1448
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,110
Where is that?

1449
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,210
That's just yellow ping.

1450
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,090
Where is it?

1451
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,290
You're gonna hate this?

1452
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,210
Why do I hate this?

1453
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,450
Oh, it's over here.

1454
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:03,990
No, you know what?

1455
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,510
I actually have unlimited data.

1456
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,030
But I should like use that excuse.

1457
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:08,670
I can be like, I'm sorry.

1458
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,430
I have limited data.

1459
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:10,250
I'm trying to save money.

1460
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:11,530
I say as I'm...

1461
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,270
That's actually such a good excuse.

1462
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:20,830
Holy shit.

1463
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:21,170
Wait.

1464
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,630
If I wanna get out of like, calls and stuff.

1465
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:33,850
Okay, here we go.

1466
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,050
I'm just gonna stay here.

1467
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:37,750
Do I have...

1468
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,050
Will I get like, ganked?

1469
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,070
No, right?

1470
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:42,730
Oh, nice crit.

1471
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,130
Wait, is that...

1472
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:44,570
No.

1473
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,470
No.

1474
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,240
No.

1475
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,180
No.

1476
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,040
Guys, I fucked up.

1477
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,980
Guys, I sort of fucked up.

1478
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,160
But I can kill them.

1479
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:02,700
Guys.

1480
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:03,700
Trust.

1481
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,100
Trust.

1482
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,460
I can totally kill them.

1483
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,150
Just gotta run.

1484
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,490
I just gotta run.

1485
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,090
It's fine.

1486
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,970
I can totally kill these people.

1487
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:23,010
Fuck!

1488
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,390
Oh shit!

1489
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,030
I didn't realize there were more of them!

1490
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:28,790
Oh shit!

1491
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,270
Friendly fire!

1492
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:34,950
Friendly fire!

1493
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,330
Friendly fire!

1494
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:38,910
Oh shit!

1495
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:39,770
This is worth it.

1496
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,830
This is so worth it.

1497
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:42,450
Friendly fire!

1498
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,870
Friendly fire!

1499
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:49,520
Okay.

1500
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:49,740
Okay.

1501
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,090
This is fine.

1502
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,990
This is fine.

1503
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,250
This is so fine.

1504
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,730
This is so fine.

1505
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,830
This is so fucking fine.

1506
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,630
Do not worry.

1507
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,210
This is so fine!

1508
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:08,710
I told you!

1509
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,250
Friendly fire!

1510
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,210
Okay.

1511
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:15,530
Nice.

1512
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:16,290
One.

1513
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:17,890
Woo!

1514
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,130
Come on, turn around.

1515
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:23,230
Okay.

1516
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,190
Turn around.

1517
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:25,670
I'm just gonna kill this lady first.

1518
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:26,890
This lady is annoying.

1519
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:28,110
Woo!

1520
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:29,750
Friendly fire!

1521
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:30,290
Friendly fire!

1522
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,990
Friendly fire!

1523
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:31,610
Friendly fire!

1524
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:31,730
Friendly fire!

1525
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:31,850
Please!

1526
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,610
There are so many instances of friendly fire!

1527
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,150
How are you still people alive there?

1528
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:39,190
Woo!

1529
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:42,790
Kill each other.

1530
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:43,750
Kill each other.

1531
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,030
Please.

1532
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,330
Kill each other.

1533
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:45,630
Please.

1534
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,630
Yes!

1535
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,390
Oh shit!

1536
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,730
No!

1537
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:50,310
Not the guy!

1538
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:52,590
Oh shit!

1539
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:53,210
Oh shit!

1540
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:54,550
Friendly fire!

1541
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:54,910
Friendly fire!

1542
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:56,990
Oh my god.

1543
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:57,190
Yes.

1544
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:58,390
Kill all of your friends.

1545
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:01,090
Woo!

1546
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:02,470
How?

1547
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:03,830
How?

1548
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:04,890
What did you do?

1549
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,210
Shoot the bomb!

1550
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:11,630
What?

1551
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:12,030
What?

1552
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:12,230
What?

1553
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:12,690
What?

1554
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:12,890
What?

1555
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,430
What?

1556
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:17,150
What?

1557
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:17,830
What?

1558
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:18,070
What?

1559
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:18,570
What?

1560
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:20,390
What?

1561
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:20,790
What?

1562
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:21,250
What?

1563
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:21,490
What?

1564
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,190
What?

1565
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,070
What the fuck?

1566
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,170
Oh how the fuck did I like dodge that?

1567
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,060
Yes!

1568
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,000
Oh thank god.

1569
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,600
Oh my god.

1570
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:46,880
Okay.

1571
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,620
There you go.

1572
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,180
I'm just gonna kill him because I really can't be bothered to deal with this guy.

1573
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,280
Woo!

1574
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,180
Shit!

1575
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,060
Alright.

1576
00:59:59,160 --> 00:59:59,420
Nice.

1577
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,160
Alright.

1578
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:01,700
Okay.

1579
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:02,980
Okay.

1580
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,000
It's just him.

1581
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,860
It's just me and him.

1582
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,620
Where is he?

1583
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,080
Where is he?

1584
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,260
Where is he?

1585
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,320
Where is he?

1586
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,700
Where did he go?

1587
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,760
Oh there he is.

1588
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,000
Yes!

1589
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,160
Yes!

1590
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,300
Is he dead?

1591
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:34,900
He's dead!

1592
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,240
I'm dead!

1593
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:35,440
You did it!

1594
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,800
I told you.

1595
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,520
By the power of friendly fire.

1596
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,900
I told you!

1597
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,880
I told you!

1598
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,360
I knew it.

1599
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,780
I knew friendly fire was on my side.

1600
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,500
I fucking knew it.

1601
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,720
Nice.

1602
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,000
Nice.

1603
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,100
The Doki style.

1604
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,500
The Doki style always works.

1605
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,240
It might not be the traditional style, but it always works.

1606
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,340
It has a 100% success rate.

1607
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,240
Alright, we need to make more shotgun ammo.

1608
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,120
Let me see.

1609
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,580
Craft shotgun shells.

1610
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,120
Okay, nice.

1611
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,540
Yeah, I got reloaded.

1612
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,440
Wait, there's a bell?

1613
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,880
I still don't know where the bell is.

1614
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,360
I still don't know where the bell is.

1615
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,420
All I know is to run.

1616
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,740
That's all I need to know.

1617
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,920
I don't need to know where the bell is.

1618
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,180
I just need them to kill each other.

1619
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,900
Alright, here we go.

1620
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:51,680
Gunpowder.

1621
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,640
Oh, there's the bell!

1622
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,240
We...

1623
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,160
We did it!

1624
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:00,060
Found the bell!

1625
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,100
We

1626
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,080
did it!

1627
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:06,780
Okay.

1628
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,280
Wow, guys.

1629
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,400
We fucking did it.

1630
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,500
We found the bell.

1631
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,140
Alright, let's see.

1632
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,080
There is... mine's over here.

1633
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:22,580
There you go.

1634
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:23,420
Nice.

1635
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,180
Or this.

1636
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:25,660
Oh.

1637
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,220
And then... boop!

1638
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:31,560
Yay!

1639
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,470
The roundhouse kicker.

1640
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:42,810
It's the thons.

1641
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,130
Oddball, thank you for the super chat.

1642
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:44,750
Thank you, thank you.

1643
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:45,470
The Doki style.

1644
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,550
30% of the time.

1645
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,070
It works every time.

1646
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,290
Is that Ashley?

1647
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:52,630
What's she yelling about?

1648
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,030
What are you yelling about, Ashley?

1649
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,160
Oh, shit.

1650
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,100
Whose blood is that?

1651
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,080
Oh,

1652
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:09,910
shit.

1653
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:10,970
Who the fuck is that?

1654
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,190
Oh, my God.

1655
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,250
Is this the Purif...

1656
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,210
Global warming!

1657
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:14,910
You failed me!

1658
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:15,270
Oh.

1659
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,130
You're not going to resist.

1660
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,210
I did it.

1661
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:21,170
Six lives.

1662
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:22,010
Exactly.

1663
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:24,030
Six lives.

1664
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:24,890
All the worse.

1665
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:27,550
Please.

1666
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,030
Please stop.

1667
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:30,550
Oh, my God.

1668
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:32,190
Are they like speed running?

1669
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:33,110
Fast traveling?

1670
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,810
It's like gacha upgrades.

1671
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:35,930
You know?

1672
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:39,170
They paid a thousand dollars to make sure she level up faster.

1673
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,370
They can't wait the two hours.

1674
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:42,070
Ah.

1675
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:43,230
Ah.

1676
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:43,390
Ah.

1677
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:48,390
Like, you want to use this diamond to make her level 12.

1678
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:01,510
Oh, shit.

1679
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,940
I'll pay you next time.

1680
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:15,400
Thank you.

1681
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:25,390
Oh, my God.

1682
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:26,890
Jake, I think I caught you in a fight.

1683
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:27,230
This is great.

1684
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,130
He is like Lian!

1685
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:28,970
I'm not sure if I can get the chain down there.

1686
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,570
Why the fuck do they have a chain there?

1687
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,380
No, no, no!

1688
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,360
Why is it so dark?

1689
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,150
Why can't I just have lights?

1690
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:55,170
Why can't they just light up the pit?

1691
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,030
I don't understand.

1692
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:57,350
I don't understand!

1693
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,890
Oh my god, I hate this.

1694
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:03,470
AHHHH!

1695
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,700
Fuck, okay.

1696
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,700
Why can't they install lighting in here?

1697
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,520
Who's gonna clean this up?

1698
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,080
Why is the cave pit not lit up?

1699
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:25,420
I KNOW!

1700
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,920
It doesn't make sense!

1701
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,940
I don't understand.

1702
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:33,080
I don't understand.

1703
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:33,840
Pro Leon.

1704
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,840
Time and place, man.

1705
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,560
Who are you telling this to?

1706
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,340
Who?

1707
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,980
It's just you and me and you don't even know I exist.

1708
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,260
Okay.

1709
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,740
There might be stuff here, right?

1710
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,900
Does he have things?

1711
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:51,540
No?

1712
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,720
Why is there like a random indent here?

1713
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,100
Oh my god!

1714
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,940
What a fucking dork.

1715
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,220
This is the one Chris wants to continue to bloodline.

1716
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,260
Woah!

1717
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,720
What the fuck was that?

1718
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,160
What's that?

1719
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,280
The fuck was that?

1720
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,080
I think I hate most is just the flashlight.

1721
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,540
It's just so fucking...

1722
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,700
It's still so dark.

1723
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,940
Thank you, Super Chat.

1724
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:21,840
Thank you, thank you.

1725
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,980
How could this happen to me?

1726
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,840
I made my mistakes.

1727
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,880
Ba da da da da.

1728
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,460
I don't like this at all.

1729
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,360
Okay.

1730
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:35,520
I hate this.

1731
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,260
I hate this room.

1732
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,080
I hate this pit.

1733
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,260
What the fuck was that?

1734
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,180
What was that?

1735
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:43,940
What was that?

1736
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:00,650
Jesus!

1737
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:04,610
Oh my god.

1738
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:05,810
That's the worst part.

1739
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:06,650
It was so fast.

1740
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:08,690
Oh my god.

1741
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,610
Oh my god.

1742
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:13,330
How the fuck do I shoot that?

1743
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,870
It's just a little guy.

1744
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:20,170
It's just a little guy.

1745
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,590
Bro, it was so fucking fast.

1746
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:23,750
Bro, it was so fucking fast.

1747
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,100
I feel like...

1748
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:27,180
I feel like...

1749
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,460
Do they have a queen?

1750
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,340
Those bugs?

1751
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,840
Am I supposed to kill the queen bug?

1752
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,280
Oh no.

1753
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:34,920
Why?

1754
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,100
Oh no.

1755
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,280
I see you.

1756
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:40,340
Oh no.

1757
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,640
I see you.

1758
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,880
I literally see you.

1759
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,220
Get out!

1760
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:52,660
Jump in.

1761
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,040
God fucking...

1762
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,180
Where are you?

1763
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,680
Where the fuck are you?

1764
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,400
I know you're here.

1765
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,700
Where are you?

1766
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,140
I know you're here.

1767
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,860
I literally saw you swim.

1768
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,620
Oh my god.

1769
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,180
I don't see it anywhere.

1770
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,040
Oh my god.

1771
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:14,040
I don't see it anywhere.

1772
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:14,600
What have I...

1773
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,380
I'm making some noise.

1774
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,120
Oh!

1775
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,700
I hate this.

1776
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,260
I hate this so much.

1777
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,560
God fucking...

1778
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,520
What's my HP?

1779
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,260
God fucking damn it.

1780
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,280
Okay, I'm gonna use...

1781
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,060
I'll use my spray if I get hit one more time.

1782
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:34,280
Alright.

1783
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,740
Where are you?

1784
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,040
Where the fuck are you?

1785
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,200
God.

1786
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,200
What is this?

1787
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,720
What is this pathway?

1788
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,080
Hooray!

1789
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:45,500
Okay.

1790
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,520
Off we go.

1791
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,150
Pay attention to the water.

1792
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,510
This fucking sucks.

1793
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,000
God damn it.

1794
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,620
Get over here.

1795
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,060
Okay, one bug down.

1796
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,740
Oh my god.

1797
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,760
Not to look down?

1798
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,300
Gamers don't look down!

1799
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,880
Gamers don't look down!

1800
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,520
Gamers don't look down!

1801
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,300
What is this bullshit?

1802
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,060
Gamers don't look down!

1803
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,260
Gamers don't look down!

1804
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,420
That was so fast!

1805
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:36,110
Okay.

1806
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:36,970
One down.

1807
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:39,630
God damn it.

1808
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:41,230
Alright.

1809
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:43,190
Oh!

1810
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,570
Can't believe it's trying to train me to look down.

1811
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,350
Can't believe it's trying to train me to look down.

1812
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:49,850
What is this?

1813
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:51,090
This is not made for gamers.

1814
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,190
Not my game.

1815
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,170
Not my Resident Evil!

1816
01:09:58,810 --> 01:09:59,430
Where do I go?

1817
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:00,410
I wonder what's over there.

1818
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:01,710
No, I'm not gonna risk it.

1819
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,670
I don't even think the loot's worth...

1820
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:07,410
Wait, can I just steal it from here?

1821
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:08,550
Wait, okay.

1822
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:09,090
Come on.

1823
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:12,430
Come on, just rivet to me through...

1824
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:13,970
Oh my god, I still actually have to go there.

1825
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:15,890
I actually...

1826
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,410
I actually have to...

1827
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,070
There's some... I don't wanna eat this.

1828
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,130
I don't wanna eat like fucking...

1829
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,470
coarse fish, guys.

1830
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:26,350
They...

1831
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:30,430
All the fishes here are like marinated with bug...

1832
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,970
bug juice and corpses.

1833
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,930
Why the fuck would I ever eat any of the bugs...

1834
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:37,950
any of the fishes here?

1835
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:41,430
It's like they could have parasites!

1836
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:42,590
Okay, anyway, let's kill...

1837
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:43,050
eat this fish.

1838
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:45,690
Anyway.

1839
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,550
Anyway.

1840
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,010
Let's eat that one though.

1841
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:48,850
That one's okay.

1842
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:50,990
That fish is okay.

1843
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,490
Could be yummy.

1844
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:58,030
That fish might have some parasites.

1845
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:58,910
That fish might have some parasites.

1846
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:58,930
That fish might have some parasites.

1847
01:10:58,930 --> 01:10:59,530
But that's okay.

1848
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:02,990
Another one dead.

1849
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:06,430
How long has it been since I was thrown down here?

1850
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:10,650
The meager scraps of food provided in the beginning are gone.

1851
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:12,810
And they don't give us more.

1852
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:16,630
The pains of hunger and thirst are unbearable.

1853
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:19,710
Most have resorted to drinking the black water.

1854
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,750
The first time I was here, I was like, Oh, you have to turn with me.

1855
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:22,490
was Herminio.

1856
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:25,530
He was so weak he couldn't even walk.

1857
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:28,170
But then suddenly, he became MAD.

1858
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:32,210
By the time his rampage ended, two were dead.

1859
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:35,550
I think we shouldn't drink that dark liquid.

1860
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:41,690
Dear Abelardo has also passed, though he fought until the very end.

1861
01:11:42,050 --> 01:12:01,450
The only thing I can do now is honor the bodies The god is God.

1862
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:07,630
Oh hey, a crab.

1863
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,160
How do I get that though?

1864
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,220
Oh, can I just like... destroy it?

1865
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:19,940
Kick!

1866
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:21,340
God, my thighs.

1867
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,060
God is dead.

1868
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,200
Oh, finally some yellow herbs.

1869
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,560
Put that here.

1870
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,360
Alright, up we go.

1871
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:46,680
Whoa!

1872
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,240
What's going on?

1873
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,340
Is it because I'm a bug now?

1874
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,620
Is it because I'm half bug and I'm getting drowned?

1875
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,920
I don't... oh my god, why?

1876
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,320
Why is... I'm getting my shotgun.

1877
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:57,700
Oh, no.

1878
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,440
Oh, flashing lights?

1879
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,100
Let me grab this gun.

1880
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,580
Just in case, you know.

1881
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,720
The flashing lights is not very reassuring.

1882
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,000
Alright.

1883
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,300
Oh, loot.

1884
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:24,620
Loot!

1885
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,380
Nice money.

1886
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:26,640
Money!

1887
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,040
Oh, red herb.

1888
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,460
Okay, red herb.

1889
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,380
Here we go.

1890
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,960
God, we have so many like...

1891
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,940
the red and green herbs.

1892
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,140
Even God can't defeat the final boss.

1893
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:43,420
Oh, humanity at late stage capitalism.

1894
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1895
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,340
Thank you, thank you.

1896
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,240
Oh, the humanity.

1897
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,580
Not late stage capitalism.

1898
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:55,400
Wait.

1899
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,420
There's like a treasure here?

1900
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,320
It's above me?

1901
01:13:59,400 --> 01:13:59,920
I knew it.

1902
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,160
I knew it was above me.

1903
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,020
God damn it!

1904
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:02,640
Leon!

1905
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,120
Why is your arm not long enough?

1906
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,380
I'm so sad.

1907
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:12,380
My arm is too short.

1908
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,740
My two short arms.

1909
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,820
Short King Leon.

1910
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,860
Can I go through here?

1911
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,080
No.

1912
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,200
Oh my god.

1913
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:25,740
Merchant.

1914
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,120
Merchant.

1915
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:27,220
Merchant.

1916
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,140
Merchant!

1917
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:33,940
Merchant!

1918
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,180
Merchant!

1919
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,240
Merchant!

1920
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:35,720
Merchant!

1921
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,840
Merchant!

1922
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:38,140
Merchant!

1923
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:39,960
Merchant!

1924
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,940
Merchant!

1925
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:45,860
Merchant!

1926
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:46,840
Merchant!

1927
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,740
Merchant!

1928
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:50,580
Merchant!

1929
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,800
Merchant!

1930
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,180
2, 4, 5.

1931
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:53,440
Okay.

1932
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,060
2, 4, 5.

1933
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,420
2, 4, 5.

1934
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,860
5 of this... 5 gemstones of differing colors.

1935
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,740
1, 2, 3.

1936
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:02,660
I do!

1937
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,880
Wait, you need a yellow round gem?

1938
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,460
But I just need 2 circles.

1939
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,920
2, 4, 5.

1940
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,000
2, 4, 5.

1941
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,400
Yeah!

1942
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,140
I could sell it for 2.0.

1943
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,760
Don't... wait, don't... Oh, I can't!

1944
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,980
God damn, I need a yellow!

1945
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,700
I need a yellow gem.

1946
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,100
I don't have a yellow gem.

1947
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,560
I just realized.

1948
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,260
I forgot there's... I thought... I don't know, it could be 2 different shades of red.

1949
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,600
No, is that diamond?

1950
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:28,060
Wait!

1951
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:28,980
No!

1952
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,160
I don't have enough Spinella!

1953
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,340
God damn it!

1954
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:37,360
I don't have enough Spinella.

1955
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:40,760
I'm just... I'm just poor enough.

1956
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,660
We were so close.

1957
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:47,020
17... 18 hours?

1958
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:47,500
No!

1959
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,160
I must have AFK'd.

1960
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,660
Oh, no!

1961
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,740
It meant the time!

1962
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:57,360
Wait, no.

1963
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,360
I don't know.

1964
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,120
I don't know if that was like the amount of time... hours I spent on this game.

1965
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:05,160
Or if it's like the time right now.

1966
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,860
How long did I AFK?

1967
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,820
Lude above this door?

1968
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:13,320
Where?

1969
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,320
There's no lude.

1970
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:16,340
Liar!

1971
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,760
Oh, you mean this!

1972
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:23,540
Where is it?

1973
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,400
I hear it.

1974
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,840
Oh, there he is.

1975
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:27,660
There you go.

1976
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,240
Yeah, that's good.

1977
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,040
Alright, here you go.

1978
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,540
Near the merchant?

1979
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:34,260
There's more lude?

1980
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,160
Or you meant that?

1981
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:37,920
Oh, here!

1982
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:38,460
This guy!

1983
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,180
Okay, yellow.

1984
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,520
God damn it.

1985
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,700
Hey, at least I can sell this though.

1986
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,800
I'll just sell this for now.

1987
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:46,300
I just need the yellow.

1988
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,720
I need the yellow diamond!

1989
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,220
Okay, I'm saving anyway.

1990
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,260
How come I have 5 reds?

1991
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,580
Yeah, but I can have 2.0!

1992
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,160
There must be another yellow diamond somewhere.

1993
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,120
I'm not settling!

1994
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,000
We're not gonna settle!

1995
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:12,380
Uh, illustration... installation of the liquid nitrogen showers.

1996
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:15,280
That were requested last month has been completed.

1997
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,920
Liquid nitrogen is an extremely hazardous substance.

1998
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,240
Exposure may cause blindness, frostbite, and even death.

1999
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,360
Handle with care.

2000
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,480
Oh wait, that's not good.

2001
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,140
It says maybe, guys.

2002
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:28,180
Maybe.

2003
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:29,880
I don't know.

2004
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,260
I like those odds.

2005
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,480
I like those odds.

2006
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,160
Maybe is not guaranteed.

2007
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:45,900
Okay.

2008
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,080
It's not guaranteed.

2009
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,160
It's a maybe.

2010
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:55,420
What's this?

2011
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,740
What does this do?

2012
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:06,740
Hey guys, I figured out what the ma- See, I'm okay!

2013
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,720
I told you it was a maybe!

2014
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,660
What?

2015
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:17,120
Guys, I told you it was a maybe.

2016
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:18,240
I'm still okay.

2017
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:19,940
Like...

2018
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,540
See?

2019
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,980
Didn't go blind!

2020
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,080
May... May nine years since my awakening.

2021
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,500
Upon release of this value...

2022
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,500
Uh, black liquid shall enter my vein...

2023
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,520
and circulate through my entire body.

2024
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,540
I expect this will be the most painful experience of my life.

2025
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,800
I await the trial with great anticipation.

2026
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,580
It is an honor to suffer through the holy labor of rebirth.

2027
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:58,840
The next time I awaken, it would be as the true servant of Master Ramon.

2028
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,200
I make this vow.

2029
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,940
I'll surpass the limitations of man...

2030
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,280
and become a true servant of God.

2031
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,840
I'll find the heretics...

2032
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,140
and serve as their executioner.

2033
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,520
Their vertigo.

2034
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:15,540
Okay.

2035
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,700
That scared me a little.

2036
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,460
Not gonna lie when the gate closed behind me.

2037
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,440
Oh hey, a lot of rifle ammo.

2038
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:21,620
Wow.

2039
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,240
Mm-hmm.

2040
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,080
Is it him?

2041
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,260
Are you the guy?

2042
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:34,950
That's not the guy.

2043
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:36,370
Alright.

2044
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:38,470
I don't like this.

2045
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:40,550
Oh!

2046
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,590
I really don't like this.

2047
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:47,530
I really, really do not like this.

2048
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:54,570
I don't feel comfortable.

2049
01:19:55,170 --> 01:20:01,480
I don't feel comfortable here.

2050
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,020
It's way too quiet.

2051
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,880
Mm-hmm.

2052
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,160
Mm-hmm.

2053
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,300
Mm-hmm.

2054
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:09,460
Mm-hmm.

2055
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,160
Mm-hmm.

2056
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:10,580
Mm-hmm.

2057
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:10,680
Hmm.

2058
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,880
Oh, I think I know.

2059
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,240
Okay.

2060
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,680
Out of service appliances.

2061
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,680
To conserve electricity.

2062
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,140
The power has been turned off for some equipment, including the elevator.

2063
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,600
It can be restored by flipping the circuit breaker located at the very back of the laboratory.

2064
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,280
Where's that?

2065
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,240
Here?

2066
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,900
Oh, it's here.

2067
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:39,360
Okay.

2068
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,020
I don't like this.

2069
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,560
I don't like this at all.

2070
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,440
I really don't like this.

2071
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,200
Hello?

2072
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,320
Oh.

2073
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,100
Okay.

2074
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,480
Okay.

2075
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:57,620
Okay.

2076
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,760
What?

2077
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,040
What?

2078
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,720
What is this?

2079
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,060
Oh, okay.

2080
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,580
Okay.

2081
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:30,880
All right, let me equip this.

2082
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:35,970
Okay.

2083
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:38,670
Okay.

2084
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:40,650
Where are you?

2085
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:41,510
Yeah?

2086
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:43,840
Here?

2087
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,560
Where are you?

2088
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:56,270
Can I kill him?

2089
01:21:56,890 --> 01:22:01,130
Can I kill him?

2090
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:04,310
With... with... bullets.

2091
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:09,250
Okay, but can I kill him...

2092
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:10,950
with bullets?

2093
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:24,070
But you don't need to?

2094
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:28,350
But he's a bullet sponge?

2095
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,230
Okay...

2096
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:48,250
Okay...

2097
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,910
Mmm...

2098
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:51,390
Hello?

2099
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,500
Oh my god, bro, fucking hell.

2100
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,300
Fucking hell!

2101
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,540
Where is he?

2102
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,600
Hello?

2103
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:27,770
Okay...

2104
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:35,550
Hello?

2105
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:37,010
Hello?

2106
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:43,370
Where is he?

2107
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:47,390
Where is he?

2108
01:23:58,410 --> 01:23:59,550
What is this?

2109
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:03,690
Okay...

2110
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:06,550
Okay...

2111
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,070
Oh...

2112
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:18,970
Okay...

2113
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,450
Okay...

2114
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:23,990
Oh...

2115
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,790
Where?

2116
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:44,370
I can take another hit.

2117
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:49,870
I hate this.

2118
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:53,970
I hate this so much.

2119
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,850
Oh my god...

2120
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:04,710
Oh my god...

2121
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:05,910
Go!

2122
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:07,690
Okay...

2123
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:08,550
Okay...

2124
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:09,690
Okay...

2125
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:17,110
Oh my god, I fucking...

2126
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,250
God damn it!

2127
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:19,610
It's just jump scares!

2128
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,390
Is this a circuit breaker?

2129
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,470
Power restored.

2130
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:29,250
Thank fucking god.

2131
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:33,820
Where?

2132
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,680
Where?

2133
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:38,780
He's in the walls now?!

2134
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:53,770
Yes!

2135
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:54,690
Kick!

2136
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:58,490
Okay.

2137
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,110
Okay, we can kill him!

2138
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,430
It's possible!

2139
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,320
What?

2140
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,240
What?

2141
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,980
Looks like it's gonna take more than that.

2142
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:11,760
What?

2143
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:12,680
Okay.

2144
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,620
There's this.

2145
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:14,580
I did...

2146
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,920
I was like, oh no!

2147
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,020
He bleeds!

2148
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:22,860
He bleeds!

2149
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,000
Where is he?

2150
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,780
Oh, no!

2151
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,160
Oh no.

2152
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,440
He's going to get me!

2153
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,280
No!

2154
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,180
No!

2155
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:39,920
He's gonna get me!

2156
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:41,820
Headshot!

2157
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:42,260
Headshot!

2158
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:42,340
Headshot!

2159
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:42,440
Headshot!

2160
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:51,950
What is this?

2161
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:52,390
He's going to, he's going to get me, he's going to get me!

2162
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,170
Oh fuck!

2163
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:54,630
Fuck off!

2164
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:56,890
Huh?

2165
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:06,840
Oh my god!

2166
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:08,060
Seriously...

2167
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:08,560
This is...

2168
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,320
Are you serious?

2169
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:12,420
Keep shooting!

2170
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:13,460
Keep shooting!

2171
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,700
He can die!

2172
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:15,860
He can die!

2173
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,400
He can apparently die!

2174
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:18,880
He can die!

2175
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:20,380
What the fuck?

2176
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:25,710
Where is he?

2177
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,110
Where is he?

2178
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:30,270
Invade!

2179
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:31,930
Okay.

2180
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:34,210
Where is he?

2181
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:36,710
Oh wait, where is he?

2182
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:39,970
Where is he?

2183
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:42,890
EVADE!

2184
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:47,420
Where am I gonna kill you?

2185
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:48,860
I'm gonna kill you!

2186
01:27:58,730 --> 01:27:59,730
You can die!

2187
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:02,190
Apparently you can die!

2188
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:10,130
AHHHH!

2189
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:15,870
Oh god.

2190
01:28:16,610 --> 01:28:17,310
Oh god.

2191
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:18,210
Oh god.

2192
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:18,470
NO!

2193
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:19,570
MY LEGS!

2194
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,480
Okay.

2195
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:24,720
It's okay.

2196
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,320
EVADE!

2197
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,260
You can die!

2198
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:31,340
Allegedly!

2199
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,620
What do you mean allegedly?

2200
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,220
Oh god.

2201
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,240
Is it Magnum time?

2202
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:43,620
Where is he?

2203
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,220
Where is he?

2204
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:47,260
Oh!

2205
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,380
There he is!

2206
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,730
That's so fucked up!

2207
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:11,390
That's so fucked up!

2208
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:14,650
Now he gets hit!

2209
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:15,010
AY!

2210
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,410
OH SHIT!

2211
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,430
OOOH FUCK OKAY!

2212
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:26,170
Yeah it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not...

2213
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:29,410
OH MY GOD ARE YOU FUCKING... NO!

2214
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:30,410
GET OUT!

2215
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:33,930
Okay.

2216
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:34,490
Okay.

2217
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:36,030
Come on.

2218
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:49,350
HELP!

2219
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,050
OH SHIT INVADE!

2220
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:57,610
I did it.

2221
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:59,450
Oh my god.

2222
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:02,130
HOOOOOO!

2223
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,330
We did it guys!

2224
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:08,170
It only took my entire shotgun arsenal.

2225
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:10,990
That's all it took.

2226
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:17,150
Just all my shotgun ammo.

2227
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:22,130
That's it!

2228
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,890
It was just that simple.

2229
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:26,410
It's just that simple.

2230
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:28,890
Jesus Christ.

2231
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:32,510
That was... That was scary.

2232
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:35,610
Oh my god look there's more shotgun ammo!

2233
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:40,770
It's like I never lost my ammo!

2234
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,210
Here we go.

2235
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,570
It's like nothing bad happened that day.

2236
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:52,230
WOOO!

2237
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:55,890
YEEEEEAAAAAAAH!

2238
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:58,790
Guys thank you for the super chat!

2239
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:59,530
Thank you, thank you!

2240
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:03,510
Thank you for the handsome bugmen for all the Doki content.

2241
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:05,490
Thank you for the super chat.

2242
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:06,650
Thank you, thank you.

2243
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:11,090
I'm glad you enjoyed my pure torture there.

2244
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:12,870
Oh yeah I should grab that loot.

2245
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:14,730

2247
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:19,650
Jesus.

2248
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:21,650
That was scary.

2249
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:24,410
That was so fucking scary.

2250
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:27,090
Alright.

2251
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,590

2253
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,830
I don't care.

2254
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:34,670
I'm gonna go all the way back.

2255
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:35,330

2263
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:45,470

2265
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:47,850
And then the blue.

We got it!

2267
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:51,950
We have so much money.

2268
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:52,910

2269
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:54,190

We got 100k dollars!

2271
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:00,510
Alright I could go to the elevator.

2272
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:02,490
But like... money.

2273
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:05,710
It's time for money.

2274
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,390
That shit was so scary.

2275
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:13,310
Jesus.

2276
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:14,730
OH I FORGOT!

2277
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,690

2278
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:19,410

2279
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:21,930

01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:22,670
Oh.

Where's the...

2282
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:24,390
Where's the door?

2283
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,570
Oh my god.

2284
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:27,490
The door is locked.

2285
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:28,930
Look at the door!

2286
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,730
Are you serious?

2287
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:33,390
He fucking destroyed my door!

2288
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:35,110
What's wrong with you?

2289
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:35,770
You monster!

2290
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:37,150
Look.

2291
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:39,570
Look I...

2292
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:45,510
I could look over the murder.

2293
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:47,690
But destroying my door?

2294
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:49,530
That's fucked up though.

2295
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:49,870
Yo.

2296
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:51,070
That's fucked up.

2297
01:32:54,330 --> 01:33:01,970
I am okay with you fucking making an army of like murder suicidal bugs.

2298
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,330
But destroying my door!

2299
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:08,150
That's uncalled for.

2300
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:11,190
That's so fucking uncalled for.

2301
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:13,750
Alright he's near the elevator.

2302
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:14,450
Oh thank god.

2303
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:15,090
Okay I can sell.

2304
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:16,290
Nice.

2305
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:17,510
Alright.

2306
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:20,110
Yeah so fucking rude.

2307
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:21,970
Unforgivable!

2308
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:26,450
That's alright.

2309
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:27,690
We got the merchant here.

2310
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:29,810
I'm looking at my arm.

2311
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:30,810
I know it's pretty...

2312
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:32,250
What about my legs?

2313
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:35,070
Oh shit.

2314
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,490
Oh my god he's in my heart.

2315
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:41,830
Beautiful little lamb.

2316
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,650
Your suffering came in.

2317
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:47,550
Just as it has from you.

2318
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:52,510
Oh ain't cią Tha Chuycan biggest pig ever find if your not.

2319
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:52,770
Go to hell.

2320
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,450
You can keep her.

2321
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:03,570
Look if this is about Ashley.

2322
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:04,150
You can keep going.

2323
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:18,090
Oh, I can see what's going on!

2324
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:19,770
I'm connected to the hive mind!

2325
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:31,490
Bro!

2326
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:33,510
Oh!

2327
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,490
It's the homie!

2328
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:42,430
Oh my god, it's the homie.

2329
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:44,150
87%, nice.

2330
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,030
Okay, shit.

2331
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:46,610
Save.

2332
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:49,270
I knew he wouldn't ditch me.

2333
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:50,490
Bros for life.

2334
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:53,010
My man!

2335
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,580
Wait, that's it?

2336
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:04,620
What the fuck did he do?

2337
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,220
What happened in between?

2338
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,500
What happened between these scenes?

2339
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,640
How did you administer this?

2340
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:18,080
I'm sorry.

2341
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:19,340
I'm sorry.

2342
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,580
It's the priority.

2343
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,680
In that case, we know what we have to do.

2344
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,660
Just homie stuff, you know?

2345
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,540
You wouldn't understand, Dokie.

2346
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,620
Princess Dulcinea!

2347
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,020
You're gonna hurt yourself.

2348
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,640
Hey, that was my lance.

2349
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:36,520
Okay, we hurry.

2350
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,040
I get it!

2351
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,660
Why help me though?

2352
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:40,940
Yeah.

2353
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:41,600
What is it for you?

2354
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,200
Can he die?

2355
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,420
Can I just make him do everything?

2356
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:47,200
You said I'd help you, didn't I?

2357
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:49,160
Wait.

2358
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,340
He's like free ammo.

2359
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:52,940
Make your way to the surface.

2360
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:53,460
Okay.

2361
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,020
Let me get some ammo.

2362
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:59,600
I need to know can I use him as a meat shield or can he die?

2363
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,380
What a try.

2364
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,800
I mean I can save ammo.

2365
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:09,600
I can save ammo if he doesn't die.

2366
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,500
Yes and no.

2367
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,100
Homies never die.

2368
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,160
True.

2369
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:21,300
Rob, good job killing the bug god but did you know you could have froze him?

2370
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:25,340
Look, it's not about... we're not here to make it easy.

2371
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:25,860
Okay?

2372
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:29,920
We're here to send a message to all the other bugs down there.

2373
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,620
Today was the worst day of my life.

2374
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,320
It's my daughter's fifth birthday.

2375
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:40,660
But here I am stuck on a mangy boat heading out to some backcountry dump.

2376
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:45,700
If it weren't for the pay, no one would be willing to work in the middle of nowhere.

2377
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:47,960
Those in the... that's true.

2378
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:48,820
That is true.

2379
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,300
The pay is really really good.

2380
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,920
I'm like... I can work anywhere.

2381
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:57,980
Those in the castle are always reminding us to take care during the excavation.

2382
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:01,040
A few workers collapsed after inhaling some dust.

2383
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,020
Oh no.

2384
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:03,880
Asbestos.

2385
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:04,640
Oh no!

2386
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:06,740
You're gonna get cancer!

2387
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,380
There's something going on here but they're not telling us.

2388
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,960
There's too many secrets.

2389
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:13,960
I started coughing too.

2390
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,640
I should sleep.

2391
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,360
Something's really wrong with me.

2392
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,360
I threw up blood three more times today.

2393
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,820
And I'm so weak.

2394
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:23,380
No!

2395
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,240
He's getting it!

2396
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,200
He's got the asbestos!

2397
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:28,320
It's not OSHA safe!

2398
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:29,900
Shit.

2399
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,020
I never should have come here.

2400
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:36,740
I came here for the money but instead I am the one paying the price.

2401
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,460
I'm a terrible father.

2402
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,300
I'm so sorry sweetheart.

2403
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:41,560
You deserve better.

2404
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,760
October since morning.

2405
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,100
It don't work!

2406
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:45,960
Why?

2407
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,300
More blood threw up.

2408
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:50,200
Many insects crawling.

2409
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,480
I hear a voice.

2410
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,660
A fine day to work.

2411
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,520
Digging brings me so much joy.

2412
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,560
I am full of happiness.

2413
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,580
I offer it all to you.

2414
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,620
Everything for you Lord Saddler.

2415
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:05,960
Jesus Christ!

2416
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,100
This is like cult!

2417
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:09,700
Alright.

2418
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:10,360
Trade.

2419
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:11,520
Is there anything new?

2420
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:12,200
Gold token?

2421
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,060
Oh it's the prizes stuff.

2422
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:15,940
Everything else is gold.

2423
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:18,400
This is like not as interesting.

2424
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:19,580
Alright.

2425
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:20,120
Sell time!

2426
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:21,720
Okay I can sell this.

2427
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:22,380
This.

2428
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,380
A gold frame monocle.

2429
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:25,200
Okay yeah.

2430
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,920
Oh my god I'm so rich now.

2431
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:30,380
Oh my god now I'm double the tax bracket.

2432
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:31,500
Alright.

2433
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,860
Is there anything interesting that I don't have yet?

2434
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,660
Uh striker.

2435
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,680
Okay I don't need any of these.

2436
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,520
What are the recipes then?

2437
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,340
It said like new recipes.

2438
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:45,420
I don't need any of the resources.

2439
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:48,420
I have like plenty of shit right now so I can tune up.

2440
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:49,640
Alright it's tune up time.

2441
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:50,800
Okay my armor yes.

2442
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,040
My armor is fucked up right now.

2443
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:01,280
Uh I'm gonna upgrade my power for...

2444
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:04,160
Uh let's see actually...

2445
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:06,540
Power for...

2446
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,900
I think power for the shotgun.

2447
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,980
And then yeah I'm gonna upgrade the power for the shotgun.

2448
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:17,760
And then the power for the pistol.

2449
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,040
Uh yeah.

2450
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,120
That should be good.

2451
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,240
And then...

2452
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,500
Oh I can upgrade the...

2453
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,880
Oh I can fully upgrade all my guns!

2454
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,680
I can upgrade all my guns.

2455
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,460
Okay power on the riot too.

2456
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:33,300
Yeah.

2457
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:35,340
On the riot gun.

2458
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:37,560
Okay and then...

2459
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,560
I think we can...

2460
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,920
We can start to slowly upgrade...

2461
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:44,960
Uh...

2462
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,320
Oh it's okay.

2463
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,680
I still did it.

2464
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:52,420
I might have accidentally got the guns confused but it's okay.

2465
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,060
It still works.

2466
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:54,860
Okay I guess I'll...

2467
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:59,760
I feel like I used the shotgun more so I'm gonna do more...

2468
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,020
I guess like reload for this.

2469
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:03,160
Alright this is good.

2470
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:04,560
We're good.

2471
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,600
We should be good now.

2472
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,920
I wonder...

2473
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,400
I wonder if I can...

2474
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,900
There's new guns to do this one.

2475
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,900
I wonder what these guns are for.

2476
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:17,960
Are there new guns for this?

2477
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:19,880
New game!

2478
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:23,920
Which one?

2479
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:24,380
Is it this?

2480
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,080
Red right?

2481
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:25,640
Red...

2482
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:26,340
Punisher...

2483
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:26,520
Okay.

2484
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:27,460
Watch this.

2485
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:28,980
I have so much practice with this.

2486
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:34,140
Why is it so slow?

2487
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,280
Is it because of my gun upgrades?

2488
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,660
Look at that.

2489
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,180
No!

2490
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,100
Okay so...

2491
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:42,380
No!

2492
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,460
It's not fair!

2493
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:45,020
I had to up-threaten the reload!

2494
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:47,940
That's not fair.

2495
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,340
What the fuck?

2496
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,400
I don't have enough!

2497
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:55,880
Okay.

2498
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,560
Oh my...

2499
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:58,680
What?!

2500
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:01,620
Okay stop.

2501
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,140
Stop.

2502
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:02,560
Stop.

2503
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,020
Stop.

2504
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:08,180
Stop watching.

2505
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,040
Stop.

2506
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,280
Oh I didn't shoot the TNT?

2507
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:21,140
Oh!

2508
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:26,990
That makes a lot more sense now.

2509
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,390
That actually...

2510
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:32,470
That actually makes a lot of sense.

2511
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:33,430
Guys.

2512
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:37,090
I don't know why I didn't think of that.

2513
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:41,370
I was like...

2514
01:41:41,370 --> 01:41:42,430
Wait a minute.

2515
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:43,310
Why?

2516
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:46,290
Why is it that difficult?

2517
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:46,770
Because...

2518
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:48,410
What do you mean?

2519
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:50,050
He fucking...

2520
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:51,270
Are you serious?

2521
01:41:54,270 --> 01:41:55,910
Gamer of the year by the way.

2522
01:41:58,050 --> 01:41:58,670
Oh!

2523
01:41:58,910 --> 01:41:59,630
If it's...

2524
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:00,330
Oh!

2525
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:02,010
It does like...

2526
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:02,730
Oh!

2527
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:04,570
I...

2528
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:05,050
Oh.

2529
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:05,710
Okay.

2530
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:08,350
I didn't realize that's how they were gonna line up.

2531
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:10,790
That's actually...

2532
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:13,330
I didn't know this gun had like...

2533
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:14,190
Go through people.

2534
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:16,070
That's your luck!

2535
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:16,910
There we go.

2536
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:17,410
Nice.

2537
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:18,830
That's good enough.

2538
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:19,910
We don't need to do anymore.

2539
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:21,530
Can we not?

2540
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:23,510
You know.

2541
01:42:23,790 --> 01:42:24,450
That's fine.

2542
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:25,150
We got three.

2543
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:26,410
That's all we need.

2544
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:29,790
Alright.

2545
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:30,070
What is it?

2546
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:30,810
Oh that's a grey.

2547
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:33,210
Twenty...

2548
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,450
Oh that's a grey.

2549
01:42:34,830 --> 01:42:35,650
God damn it.

2550
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:36,810
Look!

2551
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:38,610
It's cause the homie was watching me.

2552
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:39,190
I got nervous.

2553
01:42:40,330 --> 01:42:40,750
Chat.

2554
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:42,970
Don't you get nervous when the homie watches?

2555
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:44,970
Yes.

2556
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:48,490
The homie was watching!

2557
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:51,690
Of course I got a little nervous!

2558
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:53,650
Where the fuck is the...

2559
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:54,810
Wait.

2560
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:55,170
Was there...

2561
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:56,410
Is there no like keyboard?

2562
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:57,150
I mean not keyboard.

2563
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:57,470
Sorry.

2564
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:57,690
Oh.

2565
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:57,950
Type.

2566
01:42:58,370 --> 01:42:59,050
I meant.

2567
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:00,410
Is there no typewriter?

2568
01:43:04,130 --> 01:43:04,550
Yeah.

2569
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:05,830
I got performance anxiety.

2570
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:13,460
Yeah.

2571
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,780
They went bankrupt.

2572
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:20,580
That's fine.

2573
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:20,940
Yeah.

2574
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:21,280
That's fine.

2575
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:21,860
Yeah.

2576
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:27,620
Keyboard of the past.

2577
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,240
Prehistoric keyboard.

2578
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:33,860
Let's see...

2579
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:35,700
I'm gonna go here, right?

2580
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:36,640
Sub-objective.

2581
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:37,720
So I can... I'm gonna go...

2582
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,140
Go to the right side for now.

2583
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:40,460
Oh wait.

2584
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:41,200
What?

2585
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:43,260
What's this?

2586
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,500
Oh, I have to go to the right.

2587
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:47,940
This is TNT.

2588
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:51,080
The diamond has been relocated.

2589
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:54,960
When using explosives, cave-ins are a frequent occurrence.

2590
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:56,920
Keep your distance from the blast zone.

2591
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,220
In the event of a disaster, clean up immediately.

2592
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:02,160
Ensure adequate numbers of staff are on site.

2593
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:02,720
Don't worry.

2594
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,460
I'll definitely clean it up.

2595
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,960
She didn't clean it up.

2596
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:10,320
Alright.

2597
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:14,740
Where the fuck are the... Where the fuck are the cult people?

2598
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:16,700
Shoot them.

2599
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:17,840
Oh, it's a villain!

2600
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:18,220
Villagers!

2601
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,200
I mean, what am I scared of?

2602
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:25,960
I have my boy!

2603
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,660
Okay, that is bullshit.

2604
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:31,820
My boy is here.

2605
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,940
Where is... I'm gonna shoot his leg.

2606
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:33,260
Oh.

2607
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:34,640
Alright.

2608
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:36,020
Got his knees.

2609
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:38,000
And then... There we go.

2610
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,640
That's how I do the headshot there.

2611
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:44,710
How do I get out of here?

2612
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:46,950
Oh, vault.

2613
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:48,350
There we go.

2614
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:48,610
Nice.

2615
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:50,030
It's fine.

2616
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:52,930
We have the homies to help me out.

2617
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:54,110
See?

2618
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:55,510
Is that a chainsaw?

2619
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:57,390
It's not a chainsaw, right?

2620
01:44:59,030 --> 01:45:00,090
It's not it, right?

2621
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:01,890
There we go.

2622
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:02,690
Did I hurt him?

2623
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:04,210
Okay.

2624
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:06,490
Oh, I didn't realize that didn't cross over.

2625
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:08,910
That is my... Oh shit!

2626
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:09,790
That's chainsaw man!

2627
01:45:12,230 --> 01:45:13,110
Oh shit!

2628
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:15,410
It's okay.

2629
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:16,130
That's why you're here.

2630
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:16,670
Oh!

2631
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:18,070
Oh!

2632
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:22,690
This is... What?

2633
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:23,650
That was my kick!

2634
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,550
I can't believe it.

2635
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:29,650
Oh shit!

2636
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:30,650
Oh shit!

2637
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:31,530
Okay, I'm fine.

2638
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:32,470
I'm fine.

2639
01:45:35,570 --> 01:45:36,270
We're fine.

2640
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:39,190
This is good.

2641
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:39,690
This is good.

2642
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:41,110
Shoot him!

2643
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:46,040
What the fuck?

2644
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:46,340
It's okay!

2645
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:47,160
Stab!

2646
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:47,740
Stab!

2647
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,420
Stab!

2648
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:48,920
Stab!

2649
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:50,380
I've created my knife!

2650
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,200
Stab!

2651
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:51,720
Stab!

2652
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:52,440
Stab!

2653
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:52,940
Stab!

2654
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,260
There you go.

2655
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,040
Alright.

2656
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:56,740
It's fine.

2657
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:57,600
I upgraded my knife.

2658
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:58,320
I can do that now.

2659
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:01,060
Homie!

2660
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:02,200
You're supposed to help!

2661
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:03,840
Bro!

2662
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:07,140
Oh shit.

2663
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:07,720
Okay, stab.

2664
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:08,980
Stab!

2665
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:11,520
Nice.

2666
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,040
Wait, you're still shooting somebody?

2667
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,820
You know... Bro, it's fine.

2668
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:16,720
Oh!

2669
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,220
It was not fine!

2670
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:30,840
In the end, it was apparently not fine.

2671
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,260
Okay.

2672
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,840
I have my legs for this.

2673
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,160
Are they all dead?

2674
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,780
They must be all dead, right?

2675
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,800
Then I killed everybody.

2676
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:43,460
Yeah, see?

2677
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:44,320
I told you!

2678
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:44,960
It's so easy!

2679
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:47,740
Just kill everybody!

2680
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:49,360
Heavy grenade?

2681
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,980
Is it a heavy grenade?

2682
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:54,140
Oh, fuck.

2683
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,220
Wait, that's... Okay.

2684
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,620
This is what this is for.

2685
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,780
Alright, is he gonna drop down?

2686
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:04,190
That's a woman, Chainsaw Man.

2687
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:07,710
Alright.

2688
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:09,830
There we go.

2689
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:11,230
It's okay.

2690
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:11,990
She can't see.

2691
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:14,090
She has a bag on top of her.

2692
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:16,030
That's fucking right.

2693
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:19,310
Take off that bag!

2694
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:21,130
You would have known I was here!

2695
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:27,030
If she took off that bag, she could have known.

2696
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:29,530
It was not very efficient.

2697
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:35,490
She wasn't a very efficient Chainsaw Woman.

2698
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:36,970
Man.

2699
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:38,690
Alright.

2700
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:39,150
Nice.

2701
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:40,570
We got some ammo.

2702
01:47:41,290 --> 01:47:44,810
And then we open the door, wherever that is.

2703
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:46,570
That's the bridge.

2704
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:49,110
And then we...

2705
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:51,110
Steal the key.

2706
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:51,670
Steal their loot.

2707
01:47:52,030 --> 01:47:52,270
Oh!

2708
01:47:52,430 --> 01:47:52,710
What?

2709
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:53,150
Where?

2710
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:53,590
Where?

2711
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:55,930
Where?

2712
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:56,670
It's okay.

2713
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:57,290
He's got this.

2714
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:58,170
I'm just gonna open the door.

2715
01:47:59,210 --> 01:47:59,730
Don't worry.

2716
01:48:00,070 --> 01:48:00,810
What the fuck?

2717
01:48:00,830 --> 01:48:02,110
Why is he aggro to me?

2718
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:06,690
What the fuck?

2719
01:48:06,710 --> 01:48:07,930
Why is he aggro to me?

2720
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:11,110
There he is.

2721
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:11,690
Shoot him.

2722
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:12,390
You can do this.

2723
01:48:12,490 --> 01:48:13,230
I believe in you.

2724
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:15,190
This is bullshit.

2725
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:16,830
Bro!

2726
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:17,530
Shoot!

2727
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:21,710
Bro!

2728
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:22,450
What the fuck?

2729
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:30,140
Bro!

2730
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:31,520
I could have knifed him!

2731
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,600
At least he's more... He is more useful than Ashley, though.

2732
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,380
I have to admit.

2733
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:40,540
Like, if only they could just give Ashley a gun.

2734
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:41,760
Like, that's all Ashley needs.

2735
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,860
She just needs a fucking gun.

2736
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:50,460
The world would be easier if they gave a child a gun.

2737
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,580
In game, by the way.

2738
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:01,320
We're just gonna get rid of this guy.

2739
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,440
Alright,

2740
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:09,980
we're just gonna get rid of this guy.

2741
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:13,160
Alright, he's dead.

2742
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:14,020
Nice!

2743
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:15,060
Don't...

2744
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:15,680
PS.

2745
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:17,880
Don't ever do that!

2746
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:20,640
I said in game.

2747
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:24,940
I am absolved of any legal matters by saying that.

2748
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:25,820
I am absolved of any legal matters by saying that.

2749
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:27,280
Oops.

2750
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:31,420
Alright, we gotta go this way.

2751
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:35,040
Gotta go this way!

2752
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:40,080
Okay, there's a chest over here though.

2753
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:42,700
Yay!

2754
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:45,740
Golden Hourglass.

2755
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:46,580
Nice.

2756
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:47,880
That works.

2757
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:51,960
Your honor, she said- OH SHIT!

2758
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:54,240
Okay, look at that reflex though!

2759
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:57,380
Oh my- Look at that flick though!

2760
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:00,480
That's when you know I'm gaming.

2761
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:03,920
That's when you know.

2762
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:08,480
That was an insane flick.

2763
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,360
That was a headshot flick too.

2764
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:14,240
The gamer aim.

2765
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,220
How do I get to the other side?

2766
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,120
Wait a minute.

2767
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:24,480
Wait a minute.

2768
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,540
Do I go from above?

2769
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:32,360
Yeah, fear makes me aim better.

2770
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,540
Oh, I can!

2771
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:33,920
Okay.

2772
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:35,060
Oh, I think I can?

2773
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:36,780
Yeah, I can just drop down.

2774
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:39,660
Drop down!

2775
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:41,020
Yay!

2776
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,360
Here I go.

2777
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:45,500
Here I go.

2778
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,540
Alright, bro.

2779
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:49,260
Let's go.

2780
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:50,620
We gotta explode this.

2781
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:54,180
Yes!

2782
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,460
It's nice that they marked the stone for me.

2783
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,300
It's like tic-tac-toe.

2784
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:06,830
Oh, okay.

2785
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:08,070
I'm okay.

2786
01:51:08,430 --> 01:51:09,350
Wait, where did he go?

2787
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:11,250
Oh, okay.

2788
01:51:11,310 --> 01:51:11,610
Thank god.

2789
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:16,750
It would be very unfortunate if he got crushed there.

2790
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:21,730
You do not look like a researcher.

2791
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:23,710
Yeah?

2792
01:51:25,430 --> 01:51:26,710
So average, guys.

2793
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:27,330
So!

2794
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:30,910
What an average guy working for Umbrella Corp.

2795
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:34,790
Has the fucking cure for the larvae people.

2796
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:36,510
So average.

2797
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:39,030
Your average Joe.

2798
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:41,450
Alright.

2799
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:41,950
This way.

2800
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:51,320
You just need to paint your pants yellow.

2801
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,840
And Leon is ours.

2802
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:57,340
Holy shit!

2803
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:58,920
Oh my god!

2804
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:01,260
Bro!

2805
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:03,180
My arm's gonna get ripped off!

2806
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,120
What?

2807
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:06,900
You're gonna fucking be stronger than the troll?

2808
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:10,060
Jesus Christ!

2809
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:11,680
Now you owe me.

2810
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:13,700
Oh, you!

2811
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,540
No, no, no, no.

2812
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:17,440
You made me get grabbed first.

2813
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,120
What?

2814
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,200
What do you mean?

2815
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,480
Now you... There's two!

2816
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:25,940
There's two!

2817
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:29,680
There's two!

2818
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:30,720
There's two!

2819
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:32,820
There's two!

2820
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:34,420
Oh my god.

2821
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:34,920
Where?

2822
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:36,380
Where do I shoot?

2823
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,980
Oh my god.

2824
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:42,010
Oh god.

2825
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:43,430
Oh god.

2826
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:44,350
Oh, there he is!

2827
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:45,450
There it is!

2828
01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:47,830
There it is!

2829
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:48,950
Woo!

2830
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,710
Gotta shoot the bike!

2831
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:55,310
Okay, don't worry.

2832
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:55,890
I got the rifle.

2833
01:52:57,610 --> 01:52:58,210
Oh.

2834
01:52:58,210 --> 01:52:59,130
That's unfortunate.

2835
01:52:59,490 --> 01:53:00,370
That's unfortunate.

2836
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:02,050
That's... Oh fuck!

2837
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:02,810
That is...

2838
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:04,270
Oh my god!

2839
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,590
Where am I?

2840
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:11,330
What happened to me?

2841
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:15,730
Okay.

2842
01:53:15,730 --> 01:53:16,470
Here we go.

2843
01:53:17,170 --> 01:53:17,910
There we go.

2844
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:20,130
Oh god.

2845
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:22,670
Oh shit!

2846
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:23,270
I gotta go up!

2847
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:24,110
Melee!

2848
01:53:25,090 --> 01:53:26,370
Mike, thank you for the Akasu!

2849
01:53:26,490 --> 01:53:26,810
Fun!

2850
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:27,170
Thank you!

2851
01:53:27,310 --> 01:53:27,450
Oh!

2852
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:28,990
I got it!

2853
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:34,440
One troll down!

2854
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:36,840
I... He's dead?

2855
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:37,820
Is he dead?

2856
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:38,820
I can't tell.

2857
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,420
Okay, he's dead.

2858
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:41,480
He's dead.

2859
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:42,800
How?

2860
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:43,400
How do I?

2861
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:43,860
How?

2862
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:44,180
How?

2863
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:44,560
Lewis!

2864
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,120
Lewis!

2865
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:45,660
Lewis!

2866
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:46,240
Lewis!

2867
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:47,200
Shoot him!

2868
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:48,840
Lewis!

2869
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:52,640
Where do I shoot him?

2870
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:52,980
Where?

2871
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:53,840
His head?

2872
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:57,940
Where?

2873
01:53:57,980 --> 01:53:58,540
Where?

2874
01:53:58,660 --> 01:53:59,040
Where?

2875
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:01,760
Okay.

2876
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:03,620
Where do you think you're going?

2877
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:04,500
Wait, yeah.

2878
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:05,400
Where are you going?

2879
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,520
Wait.

2880
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:09,040
He's stuck!

2881
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:09,880
He's stuck!

2882
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:10,680
He's not stuck anymore.

2883
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:11,940
He's not stuck anymore.

2884
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:12,920
He's not stuck!

2885
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:19,000
Guys, he was not stuck anymore.

2886
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,560
Don't waste ammo!

2887
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:26,140
Don't waste ammo!

2888
01:54:32,940 --> 01:54:34,140
Don't waste ammo!

2889
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:37,300
Oh, God.

2890
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,040
Shoot him!

2891
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:38,840
Shoot him!

2892
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:40,350
Shoot him!

2893
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:41,380
Why me?

2894
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:43,380
You have a better angle!

2895
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:44,220
Okay.

2896
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,380
Okay.

2897
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,420
Alright, let's finish this.

2898
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:52,160
Why me?

2899
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,820
You have a better angle!

2900
01:54:55,400 --> 01:55:02,880
You have a better angle!

2901
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,060
We did it!

2902
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:04,300
Yay!

2903
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,220
We killed the troll!

2904
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:08,420
Oh my God!

2905
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:12,220
Yellow Diamond!

2906
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:15,820
Jesus Christ!

2907
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:16,480
Why the fuck?

2908
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:18,540
I don't... Please, Lewis.

2909
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,460
I didn't... You could have shot him!

2910
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:22,560
You could have... Why did you make me shoot him?

2911
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:23,780
You had ammo!

2912
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,040
I know you had ammo!

2913
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:26,860
You have unlimited handgun ammo!

2914
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:31,560
This fucking freak.

2915
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:33,580
I'm like, Leon!

2916
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:35,140
Don't shoot your gun!

2917
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:36,460
Distract him!

2918
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:37,640
You guys said that.

2919
01:55:37,780 --> 01:55:38,740
That's all he had to say.

2920
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,580
That's all he had to say.

2921
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:46,520
Alright,

2922
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:50,100
loot.

2923
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,640
Okay, there's some more ammo here.

2924
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:54,560
Alright.

2925
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:55,500
Nice.

2926
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:56,640
And then...

2927
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:58,060
Grenade here.

2928
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:01,560
Let's see.

2929
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:03,660
Wait.

2930
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:04,720
Where is that grenade?

2931
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:06,920
Oh, it's over here.

2932
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:07,660
Wait, Lewis.

2933
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:08,220
What the fuck?

2934
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:11,160
And then...

2935
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:13,460
Oh, it's nice!

2936
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:15,040
Some ammo to sell!

2937
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:16,760
Lewis, what are you doing?

2938
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:17,840
Open this door!

2939
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,580
Did he do it?

2940
01:56:23,590 --> 01:56:24,750
Am I supposed to go back?

2941
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:27,130
Lewis.

2942
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:28,390
Lewis, please.

2943
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:29,870
I'm directionally challenged.

2944
01:56:30,410 --> 01:56:31,390
Oh, he did it.

2945
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:32,130
Oh, thank God.

2946
01:56:32,910 --> 01:56:33,950
He actually did it.

2947
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:36,130
He fucking did it.

2948
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:36,950
What a madman.

2949
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:40,970
What would win with a million...

2950
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:41,790
Who would...

2951
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:45,590
What would with a million dollars two trolls at the same time?

2952
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:48,810
Thank you, Osus, for the super chat.

2953
01:56:48,910 --> 01:56:49,230
Thank you.

2954
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,630
Thank you.

2955
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:53,730
Oh!

2956
01:56:53,730 --> 01:56:55,030
That's where they found it.

2957
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:56,430
It's like...

2958
01:56:56,430 --> 01:56:57,810
It's like Jurassic Park.

2959
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:01,010
They're trying to do another Jurassic Park.

2960
01:57:02,030 --> 01:57:03,090
But with like...

2961
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:03,970
Like, scarier bugs.

2962
01:57:07,570 --> 01:57:08,150
Oh!

2963
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:10,090
We're okay.

2964
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:13,170
Can I make more... Oh yeah, I can definitely make more shotgun shells.

2965
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:14,720
I swear I'm just making...

2966
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:16,870
Why it's all just green herbs?

2967
01:57:17,070 --> 01:57:17,650
Please.

2968
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:19,530
Please.

2969
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:21,470
There's other colors in the world.

2970
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,570
Alright.

2971
01:57:25,190 --> 01:57:25,770
Save.

2972
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:30,990
Oh my God.

2973
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:32,630
Leon, you don't understand.

2974
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:34,310
It's the Razor Bro-Bot.

2975
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:37,210
Leon, you don't understand.

2976
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:40,970
We're gonna be so close after this.

2977
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:46,270
This is it.

2978
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:48,950
This is the turning point of our relationship.

2979
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:55,670
I have to shoot.

2980
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:56,350
Oh no.

2981
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:00,370
Oh no.

2982
01:58:00,610 --> 01:58:02,870
I have unlimited ammo.

2983
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:04,490
What am I gonna be shooting?

2984
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:05,250
Hehehe.

2985
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:07,050
Going up the rails!

2986
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:08,590
Okay.

2987
01:58:12,970 --> 01:58:14,470
I don't fucking... I don't know!

2988
01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:17,850
Ready the weapon?

2989
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:18,930
Oh, okay.

2990
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:20,430
Oh yeah.

2991
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:21,490
Sweet strat!

2992
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:22,790
This way?

2993
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:23,630
We're gonna crash!

2994
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:25,270
Wait, I...

2995
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:26,530
I'm so confused.

2996
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:28,550
What else?

2997
01:58:28,570 --> 01:58:29,810
What else is gonna come my way?

2998
01:58:31,030 --> 01:58:32,310
Is there anything behind me?

2999
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:33,590
Hey!

3000
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:34,690
The cart's flipping over!

3001
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:35,550
Okay, we're okay.

3002
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:35,990
We're okay.

3003
01:58:36,230 --> 01:58:38,270
What the fuck is this minigame?

3004
01:58:40,010 --> 01:58:42,410
What the fuck is this minigame?

3005
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:43,490
Hahaha!

3006
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:47,290
What is this ducktail shit?

3007
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:48,410
Like...

3008
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:50,350
It's okay.

3009
01:58:50,450 --> 01:58:50,870
We're fine.

3010
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:52,330
Get down!

3011
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:53,630
Get down, Luis!

3012
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:58,600
Oh my god.

3013
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,260
At the lead and shoot!

3014
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:01,040
Please!

3015
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:02,400
What is your job?

3016
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:05,700
What is your job, Luis?

3017
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:06,760
Hahaha!

3018
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:12,240
Jesus Christ!

3019
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:12,600
Jesus Christ!

3020
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:15,300
I have to do everything.

3021
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,340
Yeah, this is tempo of doom!

3022
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:18,660
Hahaha!

3023
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,140
Fucking tempo run right now.

3024
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,560
We're in tempo run!

3025
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:28,720
Alright.

3026
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:29,320
Nice.

3027
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:32,280
Dead.

3028
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:33,640
What are you doing?

3029
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:34,960
Get off the fucking rail!

3030
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:35,660
Hahaha!

3031
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:38,720
Wait, what if I just run him over?

3032
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:40,480
Can I just run this man over?

3033
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,420
Like, why was I so scared?

3034
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:46,460
Why the fuck was I so scared of him?

3035
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:48,200
My cart is...

3036
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:52,140
My cart must have been stronger than this.

3037
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:55,780
There's no way.

3038
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:57,520
Yay!

3039
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,920
Probably would grab the cart.

3040
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:05,500
Bro, this cart is going like at least, okay, one mile per hour.

3041
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:06,500
It's not that bad.

3042
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:09,320
It's not that fast, but like, it should be fast enough.

3043
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,240
It should have been fast enough.

3044
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:14,700
That was easy.

3045
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,660
Put the phone down and drive.

3046
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:25,360
Yay!

3047
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:27,420
Wait, he had dynamite?

3048
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:29,380
Okay, I did not know he had dynamite.

3049
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,120
Okay, you're right.

3050
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:30,800
I would have died.

3051
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:33,220
I would have died.

3052
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:38,580
Now, if you told me he had dynamite, then that would make sense.

3053
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:40,000
What the fuck?

3054
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:42,020
What?

3055
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,060
Where is he?

3056
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:44,880
Oh!

3057
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:45,800
What the fuck?

3058
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:46,420
There's a door there!

3059
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:52,080
Where the fuck did he come from?

3060
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:55,780
Alright, that's fine.

3061
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,080
That's fine.

3062
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:01,100
Wait, he's gonna explode himself!

3063
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:03,040
Right?

3064
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:04,880
Where is he?

3065
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:06,440
Oh no, he's still alive.

3066
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:09,820
Nice.

3067
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,200
Alright, free loot!

3068
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:12,880
Free loot!

3069
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:15,000
Yay!

3070
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:18,700
Wait, I hear...

3071
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:20,560
Oh my god, thank god there's that.

3072
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:21,940
Loot!

3073
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:24,120
Okay.

3074
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,780
Where's the...

3075
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:28,340
I hear it, but where is it?

3076
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:30,620
Is it above?

3077
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:30,880
Above me?

3078
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:33,440
Oh, it is.

3079
02:01:33,660 --> 02:01:34,740
I knew I heard you.

3080
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:36,640
Fucking knew it.

3081
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,040
I could always hear the loot.

3082
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:40,040
Okay, shotgun.

3083
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:42,520
Uh...

3084
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:43,440
We have to go this way.

3085
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:46,280
This way, Lewis!

3086
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,540
This way!

3087
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:49,880
Barrel!

3088
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:52,800
Nice.

3089
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:54,720
Oh my god, not again.

3090
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:59,120
Alright, how about I drive and you shoot?

3091
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:01,420
How about that?

3092
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:02,620
Why don't we swap?

3093
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:03,720
Hahaha.

3094
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:06,460
Hahaha.

3095
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:06,660
Hahaha.

3096
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:10,800
Why do I have to shoot the gun?

3097
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,620
I don't understand.

3098
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:17,360
I don't understand.

3099
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:18,380
Oh god.

3100
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:20,800
Oh god.

3101
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:23,140
God, I'm trying my best!

3102
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:24,880
God, I'm trying my best!

3103
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,320
You're not tilting!

3104
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:27,080
Hahaha.

3105
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:29,700
Oh fuck!

3106
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:36,980
Okay, this is actually bullshit because I can tell that he was also not helping me.

3107
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,520
Oh my god, there's two!

3108
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:43,940
He was also not helping!

3109
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:45,080
Do you not see that?

3110
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:46,240
Hahaha.

3111
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:46,700
Hahaha.

3112
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:50,080
Alright, nice.

3113
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:50,540
We did it.

3114
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:54,360
Oh yeah, I see the dynamite now.

3115
02:02:54,580 --> 02:02:57,020
I never see it.

3116
02:02:57,340 --> 02:02:59,100
He's the moral support.

3117
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:01,860
He's just takes cover.

3118
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:03,240
Please.

3119
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:05,580
Oh!

3120
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:06,860
Please,

3121
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:12,340
I know!

3122
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,820
Louis, you have to help out too, Louis.

3123
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:18,480
Like, please.

3124
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:21,780
That's all I want.

3125
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:23,700
Louis!

3126
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:25,100
Louis, you shoot!

3127
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:26,220
You shoot!

3128
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:28,940
Ouch.

3129
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:30,940
What the fuck?

3130
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:31,520
What's that?

3131
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:33,040
Okay, nothing was gonna come out.

3132
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:33,560
I'm behind me.

3133
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:34,020
That's good.

3134
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:35,220
That's all I need to know.

3135
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:37,440
That's all I need to know.

3136
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:38,060
I need to...

3137
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:38,960
Jesus Christ.

3138
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:42,620
Like, how?

3139
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:43,500
Hahaha.

3140
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:46,780
Oh shit, reloading.

3141
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:50,280
Alright, it's fine.

3142
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:51,660
Like, does he die?

3143
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:53,200
Can I kill him?

3144
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,080
Hahaha.

3145
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:56,640
Hello.

3146
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:57,800
Hahaha.

3147
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:00,900
Oh shit.

3148
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:03,860
Same guy.

3149
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:06,460
Please, I'm reloading.

3150
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,320
Alright, we're fine.

3151
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:10,680
Oh shit!

3152
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:12,760
I don't know if you have a gun too!

3153
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:14,080
Hahaha.

3154
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:14,860
Hahaha.

3155
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,280
I just don't understand.

3156
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:20,240
Why is he saving ammo?

3157
02:04:21,380 --> 02:04:21,940
Hello.

3158
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:24,860
Nice weather we're having here.

3159
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:28,160
Alright.

3160
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:28,720
Nice.

3161
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:29,440
We're alive.

3162
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,480
I'm fucking moving as fast as I can.

3163
02:04:37,790 --> 02:04:38,570
Alright, nice.

3164
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:38,970
We're alive.

3165
02:04:40,910 --> 02:04:41,970
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3166
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:43,010
Oh shit.

3167
02:04:43,970 --> 02:04:45,130
We're not, we're not, we're not!

3168
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:47,190
I'm pushing!

3169
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:52,400
Is that it?

3170
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:52,960
Where?

3171
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:56,160
I'm looking.

3172
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,180
What's that?

3173
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:03,020
There's a break.

3174
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:05,560
Lewis, you have one job apparently!

3175
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:06,760
Lewis!

3176
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:09,000
You fucked up your one job!

3177
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:13,690
Lewis!

3178
02:05:16,250 --> 02:05:19,190
That was literally the only thing you have to do!

3179
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:19,890
Jump!

3180
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:21,250
Hahaha.

3181
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:26,410
I just did 99% of that work.

3182
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:27,330
Lewis, can I get a hand?

3183
02:05:28,490 --> 02:05:29,530
The cards.

3184
02:05:30,310 --> 02:05:33,370
Give us a 3-2-1 next time, eh Sancho?

3185
02:05:33,850 --> 02:05:34,810
Get pussy.

3186
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:35,230
Get pussy.

3187
02:05:35,250 --> 02:05:35,950
Jesus Christ.

3188
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:38,270
Bro, I don't know bro.

3189
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:41,130
Look, look bro.

3190
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:42,690
I know you're my best bro.

3191
02:05:42,850 --> 02:05:45,610
Even though we knew each other for like less than a day.

3192
02:05:45,890 --> 02:05:46,870
But bro.

3193
02:05:47,210 --> 02:05:47,730
Hahaha.

3194
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:50,230
I don't know man.

3195
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:52,950
Maybe my mom was right about you man.

3196
02:05:53,190 --> 02:05:54,670
I don't know if we could see.

3197
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:57,130
I don't know if you can come under my house anymore man.

3198
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:58,030
I...

3199
02:06:02,610 --> 02:06:03,130
Bro.

3200
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:05,890
Give me a break.

3201
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:08,490
We can make it if we circle around.

3202
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:09,830
We circle around?

3203
02:06:10,870 --> 02:06:11,970
Oh I guess we...

3204
02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:12,430
No?

3205
02:06:13,210 --> 02:06:14,610
Where do we circle?

3206
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:17,750
We drop down?

3207
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:22,170
Where the fuck do we circle around?

3208
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:23,030
Oh okay.

3209
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:23,950
We drop down.

3210
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:26,490
Sorry I didn't see the yellow paint.

3211
02:06:27,710 --> 02:06:29,730
The journalist yellow paint.

3212
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:35,090
Alright, let's see.

3213
02:06:37,930 --> 02:06:38,670
There's a ladder here.

3214
02:06:39,510 --> 02:06:40,030
Ladder.

3215
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:43,490
Here we go.

3216
02:06:44,370 --> 02:06:45,410
Alright bro, let's go.

3217
02:06:46,470 --> 02:06:48,130
Thank god you have gun though.

3218
02:06:48,410 --> 02:06:48,970
What the fuck?

3219
02:06:49,090 --> 02:06:50,490
Oh my god bro, shoot him!

3220
02:06:50,730 --> 02:06:51,810
Bro, shoot him!

3221
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:56,090
Oh my god.

3222
02:06:56,350 --> 02:06:57,270
They're back?

3223
02:06:57,990 --> 02:06:58,510
Hahaha.

3224
02:07:00,990 --> 02:07:02,030
They're back?

3225
02:07:03,210 --> 02:07:04,170
That's fucked up.

3226
02:07:05,210 --> 02:07:05,730
Wait.

3227
02:07:05,870 --> 02:07:06,650
Oh he shot someone.

3228
02:07:07,930 --> 02:07:08,150
That's fine.

3229
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:09,250
My bro's got me, right?

3230
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:10,810
Bro, you got me, right bro?

3231
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:12,990
Bro, you got me, right bro?

3232
02:07:14,570 --> 02:07:15,050
Okay.

3233
02:07:15,230 --> 02:07:15,970
He's got me.

3234
02:07:16,330 --> 02:07:17,650
Oh thank god!

3235
02:07:17,930 --> 02:07:22,010
Okay I can finally combine some herbs.

3236
02:07:22,130 --> 02:07:22,690
Jesus Christ.

3237
02:07:22,870 --> 02:07:24,150
Okay, we have a lot of shit.

3238
02:07:24,490 --> 02:07:27,690
Too many have lost their lives in a never ending swarm of insects.

3239
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:32,930
Please destroy the entrances in their gigantic hive and save us from further tragedy.

3240
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,810
Okay but like, where?

3241
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:37,750
Like how?

3242
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:41,130
First up, where and also how.

3243
02:07:43,130 --> 02:07:44,210
Instructions unclear.

3244
02:07:46,570 --> 02:07:47,990
Do you think I double tap?

3245
02:07:48,210 --> 02:07:48,550
Woah!

3246
02:07:49,670 --> 02:07:51,110
Not wasting my ammo.

3247
02:07:52,550 --> 02:07:54,410
I know what to do!

3248
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:55,870
Hahaha.

3249
02:07:58,290 --> 02:07:59,010
I know what to do!

3250
02:07:59,010 --> 02:07:59,850
That's right!

3251
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:01,030
That's right!

3252
02:08:02,050 --> 02:08:04,230
I know what to do!

3253
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:05,590
Hahaha.

3254
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:07,910
That's right!

3255
02:08:07,970 --> 02:08:09,170
It's all me!

3256
02:08:10,270 --> 02:08:11,030
Stabbing time!

3257
02:08:12,950 --> 02:08:13,510
Stab!

3258
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:13,950
Stab!

3259
02:08:14,070 --> 02:08:14,570
Stab!

3260
02:08:14,570 --> 02:08:15,070
Stab!

3261
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:15,610
Stab!

3262
02:08:15,610 --> 02:08:16,130
Stab!

3263
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:16,590
Stab!

3264
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:17,070
Stab!

3265
02:08:17,070 --> 02:08:17,170
Stab!

3266
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:17,530
Stab!

3267
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:17,610
Stab!

3268
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:17,610
Stab!

3269
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:17,730
Stab!

3270
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:18,450
Nice.

3271
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:19,850
Where's the other one?

3272
02:08:20,810 --> 02:08:22,110
I swear I saw one more.

3273
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:22,610
Where is it?

3274
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:23,190
There you go.

3275
02:08:23,250 --> 02:08:23,850
Oh shit!

3276
02:08:24,330 --> 02:08:25,010
Don't worry.

3277
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:26,910
That's fucking right!

3278
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:27,970
Yeah I do!

3279
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:30,650
That's fucking right!

3280
02:08:32,010 --> 02:08:33,090
Welcome to London!

3281
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:33,990
Hahaha!

3282
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:35,910
Hahaha!

3283
02:08:36,490 --> 02:08:38,350
I hope you enjoy the king!

3284
02:08:38,770 --> 02:08:39,130
Hahaha!

3285
02:08:40,610 --> 02:08:41,430
There you go.

3286
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:42,210
Nice.

3287
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:45,570
Is there more?

3288
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:46,890
Jesus Christ!

3289
02:08:47,050 --> 02:08:47,630
What the fuck?

3290
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:48,670
He's like crawling now!

3291
02:08:49,030 --> 02:08:49,970
Get out of here!

3292
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:53,430
Nice.

3293
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:53,750
Alright.

3294
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:55,410
I need a fucking...

3295
02:08:55,410 --> 02:08:57,230
Okay I actually have to use my gun now.

3296
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:57,990
Hahaha!

3297
02:08:58,870 --> 02:09:01,410
I'm running out of like...

3298
02:09:01,410 --> 02:09:03,070
Uh... I'm running out of like...

3299
02:09:03,090 --> 02:09:04,450
I'm running out of knife juice.

3300
02:09:05,470 --> 02:09:08,050
My... There's almost no more knife juice guys.

3301
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:10,270
My...

3302
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:10,270
There's almost no more knife juice guys.

3303
02:09:10,850 --> 02:09:11,370
Alright.

3304
02:09:11,590 --> 02:09:13,110
We need to refuel our knife.

3305
02:09:15,590 --> 02:09:16,790
Okay let's see this way.

3306
02:09:20,010 --> 02:09:21,030
Destroy the hive...

3307
02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:22,390
I don't... Where's the hive holes?

3308
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:26,590
I don't even know what it's supposed to look like!

3309
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:27,590
Isn't that this?

3310
02:09:28,570 --> 02:09:29,090
Oh!

3311
02:09:29,850 --> 02:09:31,070
That's the hive...

3312
02:09:31,070 --> 02:09:31,130
Oh!

3313
02:09:31,790 --> 02:09:32,430
It's yellow!

3314
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:33,050
The journal!

3315
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:33,070
Oh!

3316
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:33,070
It's yellow!

3317
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:33,070
The journal!

3318
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:33,410
The journalist yellow!

3319
02:09:33,850 --> 02:09:35,530
I figured it out guys!

3320
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:38,130
It's the journalist yellow again!

3321
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:39,070
Hahaha!

3322
02:09:41,310 --> 02:09:43,130
It's always the journalist yellow.

3323
02:09:43,890 --> 02:09:44,410
Alright.

3324
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:46,190
We figured out what it is.

3325
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:48,850
Okay I'm gonna explode this cause...

3326
02:09:50,690 --> 02:09:51,610
Alright there you go.

3327
02:09:52,830 --> 02:09:53,350
Alright.

3328
02:09:53,610 --> 02:09:54,650
We figured it out.

3329
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:56,110
My shoulder is hurting apparently.

3330
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:59,930
Uh... The reason Lewis didn't shoot is because you're actually using his gun.

3331
02:10:00,130 --> 02:10:03,070
He didn't notice the swap because you're also using the same gun.

3332
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:03,330
Oh!

3333
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:04,390
That's why!

3334
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:05,750
Oh shit!

3335
02:10:05,810 --> 02:10:06,130
Lewis!

3336
02:10:08,610 --> 02:10:10,370
I can't believe...

3337
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:12,830
Lewis is... Why does he get...

3338
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:14,510
Yeah he's an average guy.

3339
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:17,250
But yet he gets unlimited ammo?

3340
02:10:17,730 --> 02:10:19,290
That's so fucked up.

3341
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:22,310
Okay I thought that was a natural bug.

3342
02:10:22,710 --> 02:10:23,890
That's not fair!

3343
02:10:24,770 --> 02:10:27,390
Why does the average guy get unlimited ammo?

3344
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:33,710
He can't be average if his gun is unlimited!

3345
02:10:34,210 --> 02:10:35,090
He can't be average if his gun is unlimited!

3346
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:36,050
No thank you for the super chat!

3347
02:10:36,150 --> 02:10:36,450
Thank you!

3348
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:36,930
Thank you!

3349
02:10:38,350 --> 02:10:39,500
Alright let's see...

3350
02:10:44,590 --> 02:10:45,850
Oh there's the last one.

3351
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:48,270
Nice.

3352
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:48,810
We did it.

3353
02:10:48,890 --> 02:10:49,990
We destroyed the hive holes.

3354
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:53,130
Oh the holes are gone.

3355
02:10:54,250 --> 02:10:56,370
It's like popping a pimple.

3356
02:10:56,610 --> 02:10:56,710
It's like popping a pimple.

3357
02:10:56,910 --> 02:10:57,370
Oh!

3358
02:10:58,150 --> 02:10:59,230
You know I'm just...

3359
02:10:59,230 --> 02:11:00,690
Can't be bothered to kick.

3360
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:05,010
I have too much ammo.

3361
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:09,390
Alright let's see...

3362
02:11:10,650 --> 02:11:12,010
Where does this way go then?

3363
02:11:12,870 --> 02:11:14,630
Oh wait this is where I'm supposed to go.

3364
02:11:17,650 --> 02:11:19,390
Alright let's see...

3365
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:21,090
Yay money!

3366
02:11:21,870 --> 02:11:22,870
Just in case.

3367
02:11:22,990 --> 02:11:23,890
Yeah I fucking knew it.

3368
02:11:25,670 --> 02:11:29,390
I was like why is there a suspiciously placed...

3369
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:29,650
I was like why is there a suspiciously placed...

3370
02:11:29,650 --> 02:11:30,150
uh...

3371
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:32,750
suspiciously placed...

3372
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:34,790
gas canister here?

3373
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:36,670
Hmm...

3374
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:40,030
Alright lights.

3375
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:42,870
Where are they?

3376
02:11:43,650 --> 02:11:44,930
Where are the bugs?

3377
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:47,550
You're a real rock.

3378
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:49,990
I don't know man.

3379
02:11:50,350 --> 02:11:51,450
I don't know man.

3380
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:55,930
Is that actually a real rock?

3381
02:11:56,090 --> 02:11:57,390
Oh my god it was.

3382
02:11:57,450 --> 02:11:58,730
It was a real rock.

3383
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:01,410
It was a real rock.

3384
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:04,310
I can't.

3385
02:12:04,330 --> 02:12:05,510
I'm super paranoid now.

3386
02:12:08,650 --> 02:12:10,370
I can't believe it was real.

3387
02:12:11,550 --> 02:12:14,210
I can't believe it was real this entire time.

3388
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:15,370
I can't believe it was real this entire time.

3389
02:12:15,370 --> 02:12:15,610
Alright get out.

3390
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:18,850
There's more?

3391
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:21,270
Okay I definitely don't need loot here.

3392
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:22,750
Oh shit!

3393
02:12:24,210 --> 02:12:25,090
Get down.

3394
02:12:26,650 --> 02:12:27,430
Any more?

3395
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:29,270
No?

3396
02:12:29,510 --> 02:12:29,910
Alright.

3397
02:12:31,190 --> 02:12:31,790
Nice.

3398
02:12:32,990 --> 02:12:36,650
Trying to make sure there's none that's like gonna fucking surprise me.

3399
02:12:40,030 --> 02:12:40,630
What?

3400
02:12:41,110 --> 02:12:41,990
Where'd he come from?

3401
02:12:42,090 --> 02:12:42,710
Oh shit!

3402
02:12:42,970 --> 02:12:44,730
That's where he came from!

3403
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:46,630
I was like what?

3404
02:12:46,930 --> 02:12:47,910
What's that sound?

3405
02:12:50,570 --> 02:12:51,430
Any more?

3406
02:12:51,570 --> 02:12:52,550
Any more bugs?

3407
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:55,870
Okay I got all the hives.

3408
02:12:56,310 --> 02:12:57,530
Alright up we go.

3409
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:01,850
It's time to go up.

3410
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:08,420
Bro.

3411
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:09,620
You fancy.

3412
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:11,440
I'm beat.

3413
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:14,400
Makes you appreciate tech like these.

3414
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:16,420
I don't get you.

3415
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:19,260
Why risk your life like this?

3416
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:20,580
Puppies!

3417
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:21,380
You don't know us.

3418
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:22,860
I told you.

3419
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:26,120
I passed the merchant?

3420
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:27,080
Be strong.

3421
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,080
You were straight with me for once.

3422
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:29,880
Los Iluminados.

3423
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:33,220
I was working for them.

3424
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:34,440
See?

3425
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:35,340
There was a hole?

3426
02:13:36,160 --> 02:13:38,220
Helping the two of you doesn't make up for it.

3427
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:39,380
I know that.

3428
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:40,940
But still.

3429
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,780
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

3430
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:47,400
In that case, you better get serious.

3431
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:51,840
Harsh words for a squire.

3432
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,340
I can't believe it.

3433
02:13:57,100 --> 02:14:00,800
I can't believe I missed out on the merchant.

3434
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:05,040
I can't believe I missed out on the merchant.

3435
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:08,980
Gus.

3436
02:14:08,980 --> 02:14:10,580
We made it all this way.

3437
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:13,100
You know it means we're almost...

3438
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:14,760
Almost what?

3439
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:18,020
Louis!

3440
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:28,100
Oh shit, it's this guy!

3441
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:28,540
Long time no see.

3442
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,780
What the fuck?

3443
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:35,380
Bro, that was my job!

3444
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:58,500
No, I used my knife on the fucking bugs!

3445
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:03,260
Bro, my knife's gonna break!

3446
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:06,960
It's gonna touch his skin and break!

3447
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:19,350
This reminds me of the Resident Evil gunfight where you just run around and then nothing happens.

3448
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:25,330
We fight with the kitchen knife.

3449
02:15:29,290 --> 02:15:32,930
We are just getting started, rookie.

3450
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:37,450
Wait, do I actually have to fight with- are you fucking kidding me?

3451
02:15:37,450 --> 02:15:37,770
Fuck!

3452
02:15:37,810 --> 02:15:39,870
Bro, my knife is about to break!

3453
02:15:42,070 --> 02:15:43,770
I used it on the bug!

3454
02:15:43,930 --> 02:15:46,470
Why didn't anybody stop me?

3455
02:15:47,310 --> 02:15:47,710
Bro!

3456
02:15:48,390 --> 02:15:50,730
Why didn't anyone stop me?

3457
02:15:58,890 --> 02:16:10,810
Bro, I actually used the majority of my fucking- Bro, I actually used the majority of my fucking- Bro, I'm- Bro, my fucking knife, bro!

3458
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:15,910
Okay, pause.

3459
02:16:16,990 --> 02:16:17,590
Wait,

3460
02:16:20,830 --> 02:16:21,330
what the fuck?

3461
02:16:21,410 --> 02:16:21,890
Where did he go?

3462
02:16:22,610 --> 02:16:23,470
Oh shit!

3463
02:16:25,230 --> 02:16:25,830
How?!

3464
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:26,970
Right here.

3465
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:34,780
I can understand what happened was unforgivable.

3466
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:35,260
Oh!

3467
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:35,560
Oh!

3468
02:16:38,660 --> 02:16:39,140
Nice!

3469
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:40,720
Nice!

3470
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:42,320
Break free!

3471
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:49,040
Come on, I'm trying to take you to the edge!

3472
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:51,960
I'm assuming that I can like just kick you off!

3473
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:53,560
Yes!

3474
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:53,860
Yeah!

3475
02:16:54,140 --> 02:16:54,620
Okay.

3476
02:16:57,560 --> 02:16:58,340
I don't know.

3477
02:16:58,660 --> 02:16:59,440
My knife?

3478
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:00,240
That's a- Yes!

3479
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:01,620
No, I can't!

3480
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:02,420
God dammit!

3481
02:17:13,010 --> 02:17:13,870
You're alive!

3482
02:17:14,730 --> 02:17:16,990
You mean I could shot my gun this entire time?

3483
02:17:22,610 --> 02:17:23,250
Bro,

3484
02:17:27,970 --> 02:17:30,630
bro, bro, his thighs are thicker than mine's.

3485
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:36,290
Bro...

3486
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:40,470
Why didn't you warn me that knives weren't for bugs?

3487
02:17:46,050 --> 02:17:46,650
Bro...

3488
02:17:47,670 --> 02:17:50,170
It's not the ladies that are gonna be at loss.

3489
02:17:57,050 --> 02:17:59,350
It's not just the ladies, bro.

3490
02:18:08,190 --> 02:18:09,910
Bros before os.

3491
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:18,510
You know, I led a pretty shitty life.

3492
02:18:21,030 --> 02:18:22,150
But now, hey?

3493
02:18:24,930 --> 02:18:26,470
What do you think, Leon?

3494
02:18:28,330 --> 02:18:29,810
People can change, right?

3495
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:36,760
No, bro!

3496
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:40,720
Bro!

3497
02:18:44,590 --> 02:18:46,430
I thought he was gonna hold his hand.

3498
02:18:48,370 --> 02:18:49,150
He's just kidding.

3499
02:18:49,150 --> 02:18:52,790
I was like, damn, what did happen during that cave time?

3500
02:18:55,890 --> 02:18:58,330
Holy shit, what happened in that cave?

3501
02:19:00,130 --> 02:19:00,730
Alright.

3502
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:04,270
I bet the accuracy is from the fucking...

3503
02:19:04,270 --> 02:19:05,550
It's from the knife fight.

3504
02:19:07,410 --> 02:19:09,190
One last moment.

3505
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:14,230
Alright, next.

3506
02:19:16,070 --> 02:19:17,950
Okay, you just ruined...

3507
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:20,010
I improved the moment.

3508
02:19:23,210 --> 02:19:24,570
Secret cave video.

3509
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:32,130
I did it.

3510
02:19:34,870 --> 02:19:35,310
Alright.

3511
02:19:35,590 --> 02:19:36,610
Let's spend one...

3512
02:19:36,610 --> 02:19:38,470
Let's look at him while I use the bathroom, guys.

3513
02:19:38,530 --> 02:19:39,090
I'll be right back.

3514
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:52,860
Sheep!

3515
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:54,080
Luka and Aiden!

3516
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:55,000
Thank you for the super chat!

3517
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:55,820
Thank you, thank you!

3518
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:57,120
He's just...

3519
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:59,020
He's just faking it, guys.

3520
02:20:59,100 --> 02:20:59,900
See, there's no blood.

3521
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:01,700
He's just having a rest.

3522
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:06,140
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

3523
02:21:06,220 --> 02:21:07,020
Thank you, thank you.

3524
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:09,140
She's not looking right now.

3525
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:12,880
I hold hands with all you dragoon pros.

3526
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:14,160
Yeah.

3527
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:16,220
Yeah, not looking, by the way.

3528
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:19,000
Thank you for the super chat.

3529
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:20,080
Thank you, thank you.

3530
02:21:20,380 --> 02:21:23,580
Alright, I think it's time to actually fix the...

3531
02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:27,080
I think it's time to fix my inventory a little bit.

3532
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:28,120
Let me...

3533
02:21:28,120 --> 02:21:28,740
Alright.

3534
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:29,760
There you go.

3535
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:30,620
I have like two spaces.

3536
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:31,280
Don't...

3537
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:31,520
My...

3538
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:31,680
My...

3539
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:32,020
God.

3540
02:21:32,020 --> 02:21:35,120
I can't believe I wasted my knife...

3541
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:37,900
in the fucking bugs.

3542
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:40,940
Why didn't you guys say anything?

3543
02:21:44,740 --> 02:21:46,900
None of you said anything!

3544
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:50,500
Oh my God.

3545
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:52,360
Alright, up we go.

3546
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:56,060
Alright.

3547
02:21:58,480 --> 02:22:00,140
Up we go.

3548
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:01,120
We don't need the merchant.

3549
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:02,660
Shit, we have gun.

3550
02:22:04,180 --> 02:22:05,660
You did not ask.

3551
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:10,260
A friend?

3552
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:11,040
Ashley?

3553
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:13,460
Bro!

3554
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:16,180
I don't want to be friends with like...

3555
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:19,220
Yeah, you have to be very careful of your wording right now.

3556
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:19,660
I...

3557
02:22:19,660 --> 02:22:21,800
Leon is like 20 something.

3558
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:24,780
Ashley is like a tween.

3559
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:26,900
I don't want to be a friend with a tween.

3560
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:29,820
This is a job!

3561
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:33,400
Ada!

3562
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:36,220
This is a job, Ada!

3563
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:38,540
What the fuck do you mean?

3564
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:40,900
Oh, hey.

3565
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:43,520
Uh...

3566
02:22:44,060 --> 02:22:49,260
Let's see from the... even the very sight of his image makes my... she's in college?

3567
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:52,120
She does not look like... bro!

3568
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:55,140
I think it's because of the skin I have.

3569
02:22:56,520 --> 02:22:58,040
She looks like... I...

3570
02:22:58,040 --> 02:22:59,980
She's wearing Hot Topic shit.

3571
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:01,100
Like I assume she's a...

3572
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:01,580
She's a tween.

3573
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:02,340
Like...

3574
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:05,440
Okay.

3575
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:08,580
It's the Hot Topic, guys.

3576
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:11,280
Even the very sight of his image makes my skin crawl.

3577
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:15,580
Do me a service and find some way to deface the portrait of him in the room shown in the photograph.

3578
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:16,920
Will you?

3579
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:19,300
It's not particular how hard you do it.

3580
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:20,660
Hitting it with something might do the trick.

3581
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:23,280
Ramone's portrait.

3582
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:26,180
What the fuck is this?

3583
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:27,820
I don't know what this is.

3584
02:23:29,300 --> 02:23:31,100
Someone help me recover a stolen jewelry.

3585
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:32,440
A jewel snatched by a thieving crow.

3586
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:34,680
I bet it can be found in the vile things nest.

3587
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:36,300
It's an heirloom of our family.

3588
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:37,580
It cannot become some kid's...

3589
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:38,420
Oh, it's in the courtyard.

3590
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:38,820
Okay.

3591
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:41,840
I see you took care of a request.

3592
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:43,120
Yeah, I did.

3593
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:44,940
It's in the throne room?

3594
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:46,200
Alright, it's the throne room.

3595
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:47,720
Yay!

3596
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:51,220
Okay, I can get rid of this.

3597
02:23:51,220 --> 02:23:52,080
And this.

3598
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:55,560
Okay, bro, I have so much stuff to sell.

3599
02:23:55,780 --> 02:23:57,560
Oh, I should do that real fast, too.

3600
02:23:58,600 --> 02:23:59,040
Uh...

3601
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:00,100
Gemstones...

3602
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:02,720
I can put two... Actually, I should put the blues.

3603
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:03,800
Actually, no.

3604
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:04,740
Two of the reds.

3605
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:06,960
Actually, one of the reds?

3606
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:10,300
I'll do two of the reds.

3607
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:12,960
Do I do the reds?

3608
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:14,720
No, I think I can do...

3609
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:16,040
I don't know.

3610
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:18,780
I feel like I can put like all of the kind of...

3611
02:24:19,180 --> 02:24:20,100
Alright, let's plug it.

3612
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:21,100
I'll do two of the reds.

3613
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:22,660
Alright, I'll sell this.

3614
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:24,520
And then I'll sell...

3615
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:26,220
Uh...

3616
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:28,880
Keep a chicken... Does it look like I have...

3617
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:30,360
I've seen some chickens here?

3618
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:34,480
I don't think there's any chickens near me.

3619
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:37,220
Okay, we don't need the submachine gun ammo.

3620
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:38,700
We don't need...

3621
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:40,180
the bolts.

3622
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:42,340
And I think that's everything?

3623
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,620
Oh my god, I have nine of these?

3624
02:24:46,020 --> 02:24:46,920
Eh, it's fine.

3625
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:48,960
Maybe one day.

3626
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:51,480
One day I'll use it!

3627
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:55,240
One day...

3628
02:24:57,820 --> 02:24:59,020
Let's craft a chicken.

3629
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:01,080
Umm...

3630
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:04,000
Let's see...

3631
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,580
I'm gonna...

3632
02:25:04,580 --> 02:25:07,140
grab the reload speed up...

3633
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:11,860
Let's see...

3634
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:13,200
I'm gonna...

3635
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:16,080
I feel like I'm gonna up the power.

3636
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:18,240
Whenever we get to the boss fight, this would be useful.

3637
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:22,040
Alright, save game.

3638
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:24,040
Nice.

3639
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:28,530
Oh.

3640
02:25:29,270 --> 02:25:29,690
Oop!

3641
02:25:30,210 --> 02:25:30,770
Oh, I'm gonna die.

3642
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:32,410
Alright, where's the throne room?

3643
02:25:33,910 --> 02:25:35,610
It's all the way over here?

3644
02:25:38,650 --> 02:25:39,170
It's all the way over here?

3645
02:25:39,170 --> 02:25:39,710
Locked treasure.

3646
02:25:40,330 --> 02:25:41,150
Oh, fuck.

3647
02:25:41,190 --> 02:25:41,490
Let's go.

3648
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:42,730
I might as well.

3649
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:46,430
I mean...

3650
02:25:46,430 --> 02:25:48,330
There's no way there's people here, right?

3651
02:25:48,350 --> 02:25:48,990
I killed everything.

3652
02:25:49,710 --> 02:25:50,230
Right?

3653
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:54,970
Yeah, I should have killed everything.

3654
02:25:55,210 --> 02:25:55,950
I'm pretty sure.

3655
02:25:57,870 --> 02:25:58,390
Uhh...

3656
02:25:58,390 --> 02:26:01,050
What was the other mission I have to do?

3657
02:26:01,530 --> 02:26:03,290
I have to kill something.

3658
02:26:04,650 --> 02:26:05,290
I did.

3659
02:26:05,330 --> 02:26:06,050
I fixed the knife.

3660
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:06,470
See?

3661
02:26:07,110 --> 02:26:07,990
It's fixed already.

3662
02:26:09,690 --> 02:26:10,410
Oh yeah!

3663
02:26:10,490 --> 02:26:10,950
The pawn!

3664
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:13,650
I gotta find the pawn too.

3665
02:26:14,390 --> 02:26:15,730
Where's the area?

3666
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:17,130
Oh, it's over here.

3667
02:26:17,430 --> 02:26:18,070
Is that the... yeah.

3668
02:26:18,170 --> 02:26:18,870
The throne room.

3669
02:26:19,810 --> 02:26:20,290
Alright.

3670
02:26:21,810 --> 02:26:24,230
We need to get the emerald in the courtyard.

3671
02:26:24,410 --> 02:26:25,590
And then the...

3672
02:26:26,450 --> 02:26:26,930
Uhh...

3673
02:26:28,390 --> 02:26:29,170
I think I fixed the portrait here.

3674
02:26:29,330 --> 02:26:31,090
We might as well get that over with.

3675
02:26:31,310 --> 02:26:31,950
It might be useful.

3676
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:33,310
Later.

3677
02:26:35,850 --> 02:26:36,730
Oh, hey there.

3678
02:26:36,890 --> 02:26:37,350
Hey guys.

3679
02:26:38,770 --> 02:26:39,670
I'm just gonna...

3680
02:26:39,670 --> 02:26:39,890
Oop.

3681
02:26:41,610 --> 02:26:42,090
Alright.

3682
02:26:45,330 --> 02:26:46,290
Oh shit!

3683
02:26:46,370 --> 02:26:47,030
What the fuck?

3684
02:26:48,510 --> 02:26:49,730
I didn't know you were here too!

3685
02:26:51,150 --> 02:26:51,630
Woah!

3686
02:26:52,370 --> 02:26:52,850
Shit!

3687
02:26:56,170 --> 02:26:57,590
They can't go through the door!

3688
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:01,490
They can't go through the door!

3689
02:27:01,730 --> 02:27:02,350
I win!

3690
02:27:07,390 --> 02:27:08,190
It's fine!

3691
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:09,730
They can't...

3692
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:11,670
They're afraid of the door!

3693
02:27:13,570 --> 02:27:14,130
Nice.

3694
02:27:14,930 --> 02:27:17,250
Don't you love it when they can't walk through the door?

3695
02:27:19,230 --> 02:27:20,150
Oh my god.

3696
02:27:20,210 --> 02:27:20,790
What the fuck?

3697
02:27:21,570 --> 02:27:22,210
They do?

3698
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:24,030
Oh shit!

3699
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:27,090
Oh my god!

3700
02:27:27,170 --> 02:27:28,410
What the fuck?

3701
02:27:28,430 --> 02:27:29,090
My shoulder!

3702
02:27:29,650 --> 02:27:30,210
Run!

3703
02:27:30,310 --> 02:27:30,410
Run!

3704
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:30,530
What the...

3705
02:27:30,530 --> 02:27:31,110
What the...

3706
02:27:33,190 --> 02:27:33,750
Alright.

3707
02:27:35,850 --> 02:27:36,630
It's fine.

3708
02:27:39,970 --> 02:27:41,770
How is the door still open?

3709
02:27:41,950 --> 02:27:42,570
It just works.

3710
02:27:43,670 --> 02:27:45,030
Oh hey, there's a vase here.

3711
02:27:46,810 --> 02:27:47,370
Boop!

3712
02:27:47,870 --> 02:27:48,430
Nice.

3713
02:27:48,930 --> 02:27:50,630
All the ammo I used earlier.

3714
02:27:54,170 --> 02:27:54,450
Alright.

3715
02:27:55,110 --> 02:27:57,090
Time to deface this portrait!

3716
02:27:58,770 --> 02:27:59,250
Hello.

3717
02:28:01,610 --> 02:28:03,650
Surely there's nobody in this room, right?

3718
02:28:04,590 --> 02:28:05,570
Surely, right?

3719
02:28:06,390 --> 02:28:07,710
Surely I'm safe, right?

3720
02:28:08,470 --> 02:28:09,130
Right guys?

3721
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:11,650
Mmm...

3722
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:13,990
Chicken!

3723
02:28:15,210 --> 02:28:16,930
Oh my god, I have to get an egg!

3724
02:28:18,070 --> 02:28:19,430
What, it's two chickens?

3725
02:28:20,690 --> 02:28:22,070
Why are there so many chickens?

3726
02:28:24,790 --> 02:28:25,270
Chicken!

3727
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:25,970
Chicken!

3728
02:28:26,070 --> 02:28:26,210
Chicken!

3729
02:28:26,590 --> 02:28:27,070
Chicken!

3730
02:28:27,070 --> 02:28:32,830
My lord, my true benevolent father, blessed the Salazar bloodline with an iron hammer.

3731
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:39,670
The founder of my family proclaimed the holy teachings of lust, evil, and persecuted its followers.

3732
02:28:40,110 --> 02:28:45,670
Not only that, he stole their most prized possession and sealed it below the castle.

3733
02:28:46,270 --> 02:28:46,950
Blasphemy!

3734
02:28:47,130 --> 02:28:47,810
Insolence!

3735
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:53,630
How long have I suffered the shame of knowing that the same blood flows through my veins?

3736
02:28:54,190 --> 02:28:57,050
Finally, the day of atonement has come.

3737
02:28:57,050 --> 02:29:04,370
Oh my beloved Lord Saddler, I shall release the holy plagues that were hidden under the castle.

3738
02:29:04,590 --> 02:29:05,850
The time is now.

3739
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:12,170
With divine grace, the wicked shall be reborn as a part of the flock.

3740
02:29:12,550 --> 02:29:14,010
Reborn as Ganado!

3741
02:29:14,330 --> 02:29:17,030
They shall be my lord's loyal servants.

3742
02:29:17,390 --> 02:29:22,590
Nothing will please me more than to sit at my lord's feet and bask in your splendor.

3743
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:24,490
I am your humble servant.

3744
02:29:24,490 --> 02:29:26,790
You are my eternal light.

3745
02:29:26,910 --> 02:29:30,230
To you, I swear my unwavering allegiance.

3746
02:29:31,170 --> 02:29:31,810
Chicken!

3747
02:29:35,770 --> 02:29:36,810
Is this it?

3748
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:38,490
Did I do it?

3749
02:29:39,350 --> 02:29:40,690
Is this his family?

3750
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:42,090
Oh, this is his family!

3751
02:29:43,830 --> 02:29:44,890
Why can I...

3752
02:29:44,890 --> 02:29:46,930
Am I not defacing it?

3753
02:29:50,250 --> 02:29:51,790
Why isn't it...

3754
02:29:51,790 --> 02:29:53,410
Oh, it's the egg?

3755
02:29:53,990 --> 02:29:55,850
Oh wait, I don't know if I should be sitting here.

3756
02:29:59,050 --> 02:29:59,930
Hmmmm...

3757
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:09,850
Thank you, chicken.

3758
02:30:15,950 --> 02:30:18,750
Okay, thank you.

3759
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:23,410
Oh my god.

3760
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:24,810
Okay, equip.

3761
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:26,710
Alright.

3762
02:30:28,150 --> 02:30:29,430
There we go.

3763
02:30:31,170 --> 02:30:31,930
Thank you, chicken.

3764
02:30:32,190 --> 02:30:34,690
For letting me eat that egg.

3765
02:30:36,470 --> 02:30:38,970
I really appreciate it, chicken.

3766
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:41,890
Oh, Master Ramon!

3767
02:30:42,050 --> 02:30:49,270
For tomorrow's procedure, I shall finally surpass the limitation of this mortal shell.

3768
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:53,250
What's left of me now shall soon be gone.

3769
02:30:54,210 --> 02:30:54,890
Magnificent!

3770
02:30:54,890 --> 02:30:57,390
The holy body is a wondrous miracle.

3771
02:30:58,070 --> 02:31:01,150
The felty has sworn to Master Ramon is the soul of the world.

3772
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:03,210
The soul light that illuminates my path.

3773
02:31:03,570 --> 02:31:06,190
Our fate shall be entwined until the very end.

3774
02:31:06,390 --> 02:31:08,390
Have you ever known such loyalty?

3775
02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:09,930
Have you ever known such loyalty?

3776
02:31:09,930 --> 02:31:10,950
Alright, do you have the golden egg?

3777
02:31:11,410 --> 02:31:13,310
Chickens, can you lay me the golden egg?

3778
02:31:13,490 --> 02:31:15,270
Apparently, this is very important.

3779
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:16,490
Apparently, this is very important.

3780
02:31:16,650 --> 02:31:18,070
Does it have to be golden?

3781
02:31:18,210 --> 02:31:20,050
Can it be any type of egg?

3782
02:31:21,910 --> 02:31:23,770
Does it have to be a golden egg?

3783
02:31:24,090 --> 02:31:24,210
Does it have to be a golden egg?

3784
02:31:29,610 --> 02:31:31,110
It has to be golden?

3785
02:31:31,450 --> 02:31:33,110
Where the fuck... Lay your fucking eggs.

3786
02:31:35,130 --> 02:31:36,430
Lay your eggs!

3787
02:31:38,590 --> 02:31:40,110
Paint it yellow.

3788
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:42,310
Alright, I'll do this puzzle.

3789
02:31:42,470 --> 02:31:45,430
It has to eventually lay the egg while I do this puzzle, right?

3790
02:31:46,530 --> 02:31:48,350
Eventually, it'll start laying eggs.

3791
02:31:49,670 --> 02:31:50,190
Eventually, it'll start laying eggs.

3792
02:31:50,190 --> 02:31:51,190
Okay, that's not it.

3793
02:31:52,670 --> 02:31:54,430
No, that's not it either.

3794
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:56,190
This?

3795
02:31:56,190 --> 02:31:56,710
No.

3796
02:31:57,270 --> 02:31:58,350
God damn it.

3797
02:31:58,430 --> 02:31:59,050
Is it this one?

3798
02:31:59,250 --> 02:31:59,630
No.

3799
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:02,110
Okay.

3800
02:32:02,110 --> 02:32:02,810
This one.

3801
02:32:02,890 --> 02:32:03,010
Here.

3802
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:10,720
Oh, there's the golden egg!

3803
02:32:11,380 --> 02:32:12,580
Alright, I'll throw this one.

3804
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:15,360
Alright, can you lay a regular egg?

3805
02:32:15,580 --> 02:32:15,780
Or...

3806
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:18,040
Because I don't want to use my golden egg.

3807
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:20,360
Can you guys lay regular egg?

3808
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:23,160
Okay, if I sit in here, will you guys lay this egg for me?

3809
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:27,720
Alright.

3810
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:28,560
Chicken.

3811
02:32:28,860 --> 02:32:29,800
Where are you, chicken?

3812
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:31,740
Where are you?

3813
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:36,280
Yeah, but what if I can just throw a regular egg?

3814
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:39,800
Why do you guys have performance anxiety?

3815
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:46,460
Why now?

3816
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:50,520
Alright, we'll save the golden egg.

3817
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:52,560
I'm totally gonna miss.

3818
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:55,000
Guys, I want a backup egg just in case.

3819
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:56,540
What if I miss?

3820
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:57,420
What?

3821
02:32:58,020 --> 02:33:00,120
Guys, you know it could happen.

3822
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:07,140
You know I might accidentally miss.

3823
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:10,400
You know I might accidentally miss.

3824
02:33:10,700 --> 02:33:13,700
You miss just miss.

3825
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:15,540
Lay the egg!

3826
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:16,500
Sit down!

3827
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:21,880
Sit down!

3828
02:33:22,220 --> 02:33:24,020
Lay your egg!

3829
02:33:24,380 --> 02:33:25,300
Sit!

3830
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:27,300
Sit!

3831
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:29,040
Sit!

3832
02:33:31,100 --> 02:33:32,400
Oh, oh, it's gonna do it!

3833
02:33:32,460 --> 02:33:33,100
It's gonna do it!

3834
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,640
It's gonna do it right here!

3835
02:33:35,900 --> 02:33:36,800
Lay that egg.

3836
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:37,680
Come on.

3837
02:33:38,260 --> 02:33:38,800
Come on.

3838
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:39,060
Oh!

3839
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:40,120
Get out!

3840
02:33:42,460 --> 02:33:42,860
Alright.

3841
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:45,720
Okay, now I won't miss.

3842
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:47,780
Guys, I have a practice throw.

3843
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:50,720
I have a practice throw.

3844
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:52,620
Does a normal egg work, guys?

3845
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:53,440
Does it have to...

3846
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,280
Do normal eggs work, chat?

3847
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:04,320
Acting like the chicken is a dog.

3848
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:05,780
No!

3849
02:34:06,040 --> 02:34:07,280
It has to be...

3850
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:07,960
gold?

3851
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:10,300
God damn it.

3852
02:34:10,380 --> 02:34:11,060
Okay, guys.

3853
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:15,300
We're gonna use the brown egg as a practice throw.

3854
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:17,320
Just in case.

3855
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:21,840
I don't know!

3856
02:34:21,980 --> 02:34:22,800
I have a feeling...

3857
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:23,680
I don't know!

3858
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:24,180
I'm stupid!

3859
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:25,260
I can miss!

3860
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:28,380
What if I miss?

3861
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:33,380
Alright, what was the other mission?

3862
02:34:33,540 --> 02:34:35,240
I already forgot what the other mission was.

3863
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:37,440
Okay, request.

3864
02:34:37,740 --> 02:34:38,220
Okay, request.

3865
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:41,520
Which one have I not completed?

3866
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:42,600
Okay, jewel thief.

3867
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,160
Snatch... Oh my god!

3868
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:46,160
I need to find...

3869
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:47,080
Shit!

3870
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:49,620
I killed all of you!

3871
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:52,460
Oh my god!

3872
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:54,480
How are you still alive?

3873
02:34:58,820 --> 02:35:00,780
Did I not kill all of you?

3874
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:03,900
Oh, there's more.

3875
02:35:04,200 --> 02:35:04,940
That's why.

3876
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:08,460
There's more.

3877
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:13,280
How did you guys show up?

3878
02:35:14,300 --> 02:35:15,060
Oh my god!

3879
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:16,840
I didn't miss, guys.

3880
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:18,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

3881
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:18,660
Double tap.

3882
02:35:21,740 --> 02:35:22,220
Alright.

3883
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:26,340
What the fuck?

3884
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:28,760
Jesus Christ.

3885
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:30,500
At least that's free money.

3886
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:31,620
Alright.

3887
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:33,640
Down here...

3888
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:35,220
And then there's...

3889
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:36,000
The courtyard.

3890
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:38,720
Alright, time to get that...

3891
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:40,620
Is it just one crow?

3892
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:42,560
Chat?

3893
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:45,180
How many...

3894
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:47,560
Is the crow easy to find?

3895
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,960
That's my biggest question.

3896
02:35:52,020 --> 02:35:54,320
Is the crow easy to find?

3897
02:35:57,840 --> 02:35:59,760
That's what I'm worried about.

3898
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,640
Alright, let's save just in case.

3899
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:07,540
Alright, let's save just in case.

3900
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:08,820
It's in the nest?

3901
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:13,160
It's around the merchant area?

3902
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:14,400
Which one?

3903
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:15,060
This one?

3904
02:36:16,140 --> 02:36:18,140
The courtyard's right in front of me.

3905
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,200
That's you, isn't it?

3906
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:29,080
That wasn't that crow.

3907
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:31,040
Guys, it wasn't that crow, guys.

3908
02:36:32,660 --> 02:36:34,600
You don't even have loot!

3909
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:35,260
You don't even have loot!

3910
02:36:36,220 --> 02:36:37,860
This crow doesn't even...

3911
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:39,780
It doesn't even have loot!

3912
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:42,400
It's not loot crow!

3913
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:48,680
I was supposed to follow him!

3914
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:50,440
Oh, oh he's back alive!

3915
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:52,940
He's alive again!

3916
02:36:55,850 --> 02:36:56,730
He's alive!

3917
02:36:57,070 --> 02:36:59,110
It was just a flesh wound!

3918
02:37:00,950 --> 02:37:03,470
Guys, I told you.

3919
02:37:03,770 --> 02:37:07,230
It was just a flesh wound, guys.

3920
02:37:09,030 --> 02:37:10,110
It's okay.

3921
02:37:11,950 --> 02:37:12,750
It's okay.

3922
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:15,810
He was just being dramatic, chat.

3923
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:17,170
He lives!

3924
02:37:17,350 --> 02:37:18,050
Bird Jesus!

3925
02:37:20,350 --> 02:37:23,390
It was just a flesh wound, chat.

3926
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:25,330
I knew I couldn't...

3927
02:37:25,950 --> 02:37:27,270
It wasn't my fault.

3928
02:37:27,630 --> 02:37:29,350
Oh, give me that fish.

3929
02:37:29,950 --> 02:37:31,110
Give me that...

3930
02:37:31,110 --> 02:37:32,110
Big bass.

3931
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:33,790
Okay.

3932
02:37:35,150 --> 02:37:35,790
Alright.

3933
02:37:35,910 --> 02:37:36,990
There's another one.

3934
02:37:37,630 --> 02:37:38,750
Oh my gosh.

3935
02:37:39,150 --> 02:37:39,990
There we go.

3936
02:37:40,370 --> 02:37:43,530
Alright, this is a little dirty here.

3937
02:37:44,190 --> 02:37:44,830
Okay.

3938
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:45,930
Let's see.

3939
02:37:46,270 --> 02:37:48,030
Okay, I need to look how much...

3940
02:37:48,030 --> 02:37:51,570
Alright, we're gonna figure...

3941
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:52,910
We're gonna figure this out.

3942
02:37:53,910 --> 02:37:55,550
We can Tetris this.

3943
02:37:56,170 --> 02:37:58,090
We're gonna figure this out.

3944
02:37:58,690 --> 02:37:59,790
We're gonna figure...

3945
02:38:01,590 --> 02:38:02,870
This out.

3946
02:38:03,030 --> 02:38:03,670
This out.

3947
02:38:03,790 --> 02:38:04,490
Let's see.

3948
02:38:04,630 --> 02:38:06,030
I'll just mix all the green herbs.

3949
02:38:07,290 --> 02:38:08,010
I'll do that.

3950
02:38:09,610 --> 02:38:10,510
There we go.

3951
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:13,450
Oh.

3952
02:38:14,310 --> 02:38:15,450
Bum ba da dum.

3953
02:38:15,570 --> 02:38:16,310
Ba da dum.

3954
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:19,510
Ba dum ba dum.

3955
02:38:19,710 --> 02:38:20,410
Bum bum.

3956
02:38:21,250 --> 02:38:22,270
Bum ba dum.

3957
02:38:22,930 --> 02:38:23,870
There we go.

3958
02:38:24,050 --> 02:38:24,810
See, I told you.

3959
02:38:26,250 --> 02:38:27,430
I told you guys.

3960
02:38:27,750 --> 02:38:28,650
Wait, is that another fish?

3961
02:38:28,650 --> 02:38:28,990
No.

3962
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:32,490
Doki, you have a problem.

3963
02:38:33,210 --> 02:38:34,330
Doki, you have a problem.

3964
02:38:34,430 --> 02:38:38,110
You gotta get rid of all this fish.

3965
02:38:39,370 --> 02:38:40,010
You gotta get rid of all this fish.

3966
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:40,930
You can't keep...

3967
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:44,550
You can't keep...

3968
02:38:44,550 --> 02:38:44,610
You can't keep...

3969
02:38:45,250 --> 02:38:47,010
killing all the fish, Doki.

3970
02:38:47,490 --> 02:38:47,650
killing all the fish, Doki.

3971
02:38:49,570 --> 02:38:50,810
Yeah, I already got the beta.

3972
02:38:51,150 --> 02:38:53,290
And I sold it for money instantly.

3973
02:38:54,330 --> 02:38:55,550
Alright, let's go...

3974
02:38:56,310 --> 02:38:58,210
Let's go turn in this...

3975
02:38:58,650 --> 02:38:58,870
quest.

3976
02:38:59,250 --> 02:38:59,910
Yay!

3977
02:39:01,270 --> 02:39:01,930
Trade.

3978
02:39:02,250 --> 02:39:03,230
I have 10.

3979
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:04,970
Let's see.

3980
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:08,170
Nah, there's nothing I need.

3981
02:39:11,790 --> 02:39:13,110
Save game.

3982
02:39:14,330 --> 02:39:15,790
I can't believe it.

3983
02:39:15,810 --> 02:39:16,750
We met Bird Jesus.

3984
02:39:22,690 --> 02:39:24,870
We met Bird Jesus.

3985
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:26,510
I can't believe it.

3986
02:39:26,530 --> 02:39:27,430
What an honor.

3987
02:39:28,690 --> 02:39:30,390
What a fucking honor.

3988
02:39:34,250 --> 02:39:35,450
Holy shit.

3989
02:39:36,830 --> 02:39:37,770
That's crazy.

3990
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:40,670
He came back to life in front of all of us.

3991
02:39:41,250 --> 02:39:42,730
It was a miracle.

3992
02:39:43,570 --> 02:39:44,390
Which way?

3993
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:46,090
This way?

3994
02:39:46,290 --> 02:39:47,810
No, it was like within here.

3995
02:39:48,230 --> 02:39:49,630
A fucking miracle.

3996
02:39:49,630 --> 02:39:49,830
A miracle!

3997
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:55,040
Yeah, I can sell it here.

3998
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:56,660
I'll sell the emerald here.

3999
02:39:59,140 --> 02:39:59,920
Alright, hello.

4000
02:40:00,100 --> 02:40:00,600
I'm back.

4001
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,240
Sell the scratch emerald here.

4002
02:40:05,220 --> 02:40:05,780
Yay!

4003
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:10,980
I look like I'm selling his own fucking emerald back to him.

4004
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:12,200
I look like I'm selling his own fucking emerald back to him.

4005
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:15,560
I sold it back to him.

4006
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:19,800
But you shot him?

4007
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:21,080
That's what the media wants to see.

4008
02:40:21,100 --> 02:40:21,840
That's fake news.

4009
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:24,100
That's fucking fake news.

4010
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:26,880
I can't believe you got brainwashed by the media.

4011
02:40:27,220 --> 02:40:28,100
I would never!

4012
02:40:28,280 --> 02:40:29,840
I would never shoot Bird Jesus.

4013
02:40:31,100 --> 02:40:32,820
That's not something Doki would do.

4014
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:37,960
Hey, some more money.

4015
02:40:39,400 --> 02:40:39,960
Money!

4016
02:40:41,780 --> 02:40:42,340
Alright.

4017
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:44,340
Deceived by fake news.

4018
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:46,680
How could you guys believe in those things?

4019
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:50,140
Tsk, tsk, tsk!

4020
02:40:51,100 --> 02:40:52,900
Thought I taught you guys better!

4021
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:57,260
Up we go!

4022
02:40:57,560 --> 02:40:57,900
Up we go!

4023
02:40:57,900 --> 02:40:58,360
Up we go!

4024
02:40:58,420 --> 02:41:00,420
Oh my god, there is a lot of loot here.

4025
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:02,220
What the fuck?

4026
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:03,220
Whose statue is that?

4027
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:04,160
That's him!

4028
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:07,140
Bird vs.

4029
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:08,100
Bird pilots.

4030
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:09,060
Bird vs.

4031
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:09,440
Bird pilots.

4032
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:10,980
I'm telling you, Mr. Kennedy.

4033
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:14,780
However, I'm afraid it ends here.

4034
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:17,020
Expel this intruder!

4035
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:20,880
It's the guy!

4036
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:23,660
Don't worry.

4037
02:41:24,100 --> 02:41:26,560
I got my pistol right here.

4038
02:41:27,320 --> 02:41:28,220
It's fine.

4039
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:31,420
It's fine.

4040
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:32,460
I can just stay here.

4041
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:34,980
I don't have to move.

4042
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:37,000
I'm not scared.

4043
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:39,400
Look at that.

4044
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:44,120
If I stay here, they'll just... I don't have to move.

4045
02:41:44,220 --> 02:41:44,440
Watch.

4046
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:45,760
This is the no move run.

4047
02:41:47,300 --> 02:41:48,680
No move run right here.

4048
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:50,100
Reloading first.

4049
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:51,540
Reloading.

4050
02:41:53,020 --> 02:41:53,740
There you go.

4051
02:41:54,460 --> 02:41:55,200
Is there anymore?

4052
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:57,060
I see you.

4053
02:41:57,380 --> 02:41:57,820
Wait.

4054
02:41:58,260 --> 02:41:59,220
I see you.

4055
02:41:59,320 --> 02:42:00,100
What the f... What?

4056
02:42:00,740 --> 02:42:01,500
Okay, wait, wait.

4057
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:02,680
I see you.

4058
02:42:02,740 --> 02:42:03,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4059
02:42:03,800 --> 02:42:04,200
Where is he?

4060
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:05,020
Oh, I see you.

4061
02:42:05,980 --> 02:42:07,020
That's fucking right.

4062
02:42:08,220 --> 02:42:09,720
I don't have... Okay, I moved.

4063
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:12,140
Doesn't count.

4064
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:14,200
I'm technically still in the same spot, chat.

4065
02:42:15,240 --> 02:42:16,020
Is that it?

4066
02:42:17,540 --> 02:42:18,300
Is that it?

4067
02:42:18,500 --> 02:42:19,020
That was fast.

4068
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:21,580
Is there no more?

4069
02:42:22,380 --> 02:42:23,180
Come down!

4070
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:26,100
Come down!

4071
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:27,320
Cowards!

4072
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:29,420
Oh my god.

4073
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:32,600
They're gonna make me walk all the way to them now?

4074
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:34,640
That's fucked up.

4075
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:37,000
How could they do this to me?

4076
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:40,220
Oh, there's loot though.

4077
02:42:42,260 --> 02:42:44,120
Alright, they don't come over to me!

4078
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:45,000
That's not my fault!

4079
02:42:46,180 --> 02:42:49,160
How could I do the no move run if they don't move either?

4080
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:51,720
Like...

4081
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:55,280
How does no move run work if they don't move?

4082
02:42:57,260 --> 02:42:58,000
Alright, nice.

4083
02:42:58,780 --> 02:42:59,620
Let's see.

4084
02:43:01,140 --> 02:43:03,520
Alright, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna shoot their toes.

4085
02:43:03,980 --> 02:43:04,780
What the fuck?

4086
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:06,120
Yeah.

4087
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:06,200
There we go.

4088
02:43:06,400 --> 02:43:07,880
Let me grab that barrel.

4089
02:43:08,420 --> 02:43:10,300
And then... any other loot here?

4090
02:43:10,660 --> 02:43:11,680
That should be it.

4091
02:43:11,960 --> 02:43:12,440
Wait!

4092
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:14,280
There's a mini guy.

4093
02:43:15,180 --> 02:43:15,740
Nice.

4094
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:17,280
Alright.

4095
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:19,320
There we go.

4096
02:43:19,340 --> 02:43:19,880
Up we go.

4097
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:21,980
Up we go.

4098
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:26,080
Where are they?

4099
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:27,760
Hello?

4100
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:29,840
Monks?

4101
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,080
Cult followers?

4102
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:35,380
I hear you whispering.

4103
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:36,220
Oh, there you are.

4104
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:38,280
Nice.

4105
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:39,880
That's all...

4106
02:43:39,880 --> 02:43:40,860
No, that's not a crit.

4107
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:41,980
There you go.

4108
02:43:44,480 --> 02:43:48,000
I mean, it's not so bad being a fucking cult member.

4109
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:48,880
Like, look at that.

4110
02:43:49,140 --> 02:43:52,520
Like, if I can tank, I'll never be afraid of dying!

4111
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:54,500
Like, think about it.

4112
02:43:54,520 --> 02:43:57,680
You'll never be afraid of dying because you can just tank like six headshots.

4113
02:43:57,840 --> 02:43:59,600
What the fuck?

4114
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:02,060
What the fuck?

4115
02:44:02,060 --> 02:44:04,800
Oh, he burned too.

4116
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:05,240
Okay.

4117
02:44:05,640 --> 02:44:06,200
Okay.

4118
02:44:14,440 --> 02:44:16,040
He was helping me.

4119
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:17,200
He was helping.

4120
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:21,980
Okay, you think about it the flamethrower was helping me.

4121
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:29,380
Okay, maybe I can just stay here.

4122
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:32,460
Oh, I can stay here.

4123
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:34,880
Yeah, I'll be fine.

4124
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:38,460
If I don't move, they'll just burn this guys.

4125
02:44:38,660 --> 02:44:38,840
Yeah.

4126
02:44:43,140 --> 02:44:44,480
I don't have to move.

4127
02:44:48,030 --> 02:44:49,050
What the fuck?

4128
02:44:49,130 --> 02:44:50,390
I don't even see this guy.

4129
02:44:54,870 --> 02:44:55,670
Come on.

4130
02:44:56,150 --> 02:44:57,370
There's no way he's fast.

4131
02:44:57,550 --> 02:44:58,350
Oh, he's faster?

4132
02:44:59,350 --> 02:45:00,130
There you go.

4133
02:45:00,310 --> 02:45:01,010
Give me a sec.

4134
02:45:01,710 --> 02:45:03,250
I just want to make sure that he's dead.

4135
02:45:04,730 --> 02:45:05,910
Before I do anything.

4136
02:45:06,610 --> 02:45:07,010
C'mon.

4137
02:45:09,570 --> 02:45:09,970
What?

4138
02:45:10,490 --> 02:45:11,190
There you go.

4139
02:45:11,390 --> 02:45:12,150
All right, here we go.

4140
02:45:12,730 --> 02:45:13,370
I'm ready.

4141
02:45:14,390 --> 02:45:15,010
I'm ready.

4142
02:45:17,370 --> 02:45:17,770
Easy.

4143
02:45:22,210 --> 02:45:23,130
Fucking easy.

4144
02:45:24,510 --> 02:45:25,190
Oh shit!

4145
02:45:27,070 --> 02:45:28,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

4146
02:45:29,030 --> 02:45:29,650
Kick, kick, kick, kick!

4147
02:45:30,390 --> 02:45:31,130
This was important!

4148
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:35,410
Okay, kick!

4149
02:45:35,590 --> 02:45:36,910
Wait, what?!

4150
02:45:38,570 --> 02:45:39,850
What the fuck is that?!

4151
02:45:39,850 --> 02:45:41,050
Oh shit!

4152
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:47,380
Where is that coming from?!

4153
02:45:47,380 --> 02:45:48,340
No, not the fire!

4154
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:53,280
Where is it coming from?!

4155
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:55,040
Is it gonna come towards me?

4156
02:45:55,980 --> 02:45:56,800
Oh, it's gone.

4157
02:45:56,900 --> 02:45:57,160
Okay.

4158
02:45:57,720 --> 02:45:58,420
It's fine.

4159
02:45:58,480 --> 02:45:58,840
We're fine.

4160
02:46:00,380 --> 02:46:01,080
It's fine.

4161
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:01,500
We're fine.

4162
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:01,820
See?

4163
02:46:02,300 --> 02:46:04,000
Nothing to worry about.

4164
02:46:04,860 --> 02:46:05,920
It's just one, right?

4165
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:08,880
Oh, it is not just one!

4166
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:15,060
It's not just one spiky boss!

4167
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:19,880
Why is there multiple spiky boss?!

4168
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:23,360
Nooooooooooo!

4169
02:46:24,820 --> 02:46:25,760
Oh, thank God.

4170
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:25,980
Okay.

4171
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:27,240
Okay, thank God.

4172
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:28,820
I thought there was like more spiky boss.

4173
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:29,740
Nothing to worry about.

4174
02:46:31,260 --> 02:46:31,660
Nooooooooo!

4175
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:39,750
Get me in the hole!

4176
02:46:42,210 --> 02:46:43,150
Okay, I'm in the hole.

4177
02:46:43,330 --> 02:46:44,130
Alright, it's fine.

4178
02:46:44,310 --> 02:46:45,130
Nothing to worry about.

4179
02:46:45,330 --> 02:46:46,070
I'm in the hole.

4180
02:46:46,730 --> 02:46:47,130
Alright.

4181
02:46:47,510 --> 02:46:49,070
Oh, I can eat my fish now!

4182
02:46:51,910 --> 02:46:53,890
Slightly large bread as an eating fish.

4183
02:46:54,050 --> 02:46:55,470
Okay, I need to eat the fish.

4184
02:46:56,250 --> 02:46:57,430
I need to eat the fish.

4185
02:46:59,770 --> 02:47:01,990
Okay, when is the next ball coming over?

4186
02:47:02,610 --> 02:47:03,290
Is that it?

4187
02:47:03,450 --> 02:47:04,090
There's no more balls?

4188
02:47:07,470 --> 02:47:09,970
Okay, we gotta wait for this ball to drop out.

4189
02:47:11,190 --> 02:47:12,190
Alright, nice.

4190
02:47:14,670 --> 02:47:15,110
Nice.

4191
02:47:16,510 --> 02:47:17,830
Can I outrun this other?

4192
02:47:17,930 --> 02:47:18,750
Okay, yeah, I can.

4193
02:47:19,250 --> 02:47:20,050
Fucking bitch.

4194
02:47:20,790 --> 02:47:21,230
Bitch.

4195
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:22,550
What?

4196
02:47:26,450 --> 02:47:26,890
Okay!

4197
02:47:26,890 --> 02:47:28,230
Okay, I don't know.

4198
02:47:28,330 --> 02:47:30,450
I thought like, you know...

4199
02:47:31,310 --> 02:47:32,130
I don't know.

4200
02:47:32,170 --> 02:47:34,130
I thought he would just let me stab him.

4201
02:47:34,130 --> 02:47:37,030
I didn't realize he's just gonna watch me.

4202
02:47:37,330 --> 02:47:40,090
Like, how was I supposed to know he's just gonna grab me?

4203
02:47:42,430 --> 02:47:43,830
He stood still!

4204
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:47,850
I thought I was safe because he stood still!

4205
02:47:52,260 --> 02:47:53,920
Wait, can they even get up?

4206
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:55,860
No, they can't.

4207
02:47:55,860 --> 02:47:56,780
Where are they gonna go?

4208
02:47:57,500 --> 02:47:59,020
They can't even... What?

4209
02:47:59,220 --> 02:48:00,580
How are they gonna get to me?

4210
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:03,100
God, it is...

4211
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:04,280
Oh!

4212
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:05,200
Oh!

4213
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:06,260
He... They... They...

4214
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:07,120
Oh!

4215
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:08,680
Oh!

4216
02:48:08,740 --> 02:48:10,420
They're walking to me!

4217
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:12,800
Oh!

4218
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:13,240
Okay.

4219
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:14,600
Okay, that's fine.

4220
02:48:15,660 --> 02:48:16,320
That's fine.

4221
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:16,660
I...

4222
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:19,120
He has to drop down, right?

4223
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:20,700
Yeah.

4224
02:48:20,860 --> 02:48:22,500
He has to drop down, right?

4225
02:48:24,860 --> 02:48:25,900
Yeah, there you go.

4226
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:29,320
Alright, free loot.

4227
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:31,400
Wait.

4228
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:31,840
Wait.

4229
02:48:32,260 --> 02:48:33,080
Wait a minute.

4230
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:33,360
Wait a minute.

4231
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:36,580
That's someone changing!

4232
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:39,800
It's okay.

4233
02:48:39,900 --> 02:48:41,320
They're not... They don't know how to fall down.

4234
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:42,920
Free loot.

4235
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:47,580
No, we're gonna hoard our grenades until the...

4236
02:48:47,580 --> 02:48:49,440
Until the next game, chat.

4237
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:50,640
You know the drill.

4238
02:48:51,280 --> 02:48:52,400
We're all gonna hoard.

4239
02:48:56,160 --> 02:49:00,060
We're gonna hoard until the... Until Resident Evil 5.

4240
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:04,300
It's not wasting ammo!

4241
02:49:06,480 --> 02:49:08,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

4242
02:49:09,140 --> 02:49:11,600
Can I like shoot this and grab it here?

4243
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:12,800
Yeah, I can.

4244
02:49:13,140 --> 02:49:14,100
Wait, I can.

4245
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:15,020
That's so nice.

4246
02:49:15,480 --> 02:49:16,680
Alright, that's good.

4247
02:49:16,840 --> 02:49:18,680
I can... I can just grab it like that.

4248
02:49:19,160 --> 02:49:20,520
Wait, there is...

4249
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:22,780
There's a treasure here somewhere.

4250
02:49:23,540 --> 02:49:24,420
Where is it?

4251
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:27,020
Where's the treasure?

4252
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:28,520
Huh?

4253
02:49:30,220 --> 02:49:32,160
Where the fuck... Oh, it's right here!

4254
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:33,340
How do we get there?

4255
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:34,000
Oh, wait.

4256
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:34,760
It's above me.

4257
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:39,540
It's not a waste, chat!

4258
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:42,300
It's not a waste!

4259
02:49:43,560 --> 02:49:44,380
Nice herb.

4260
02:49:46,340 --> 02:49:49,060
Because wasting grenades is a bigger waste.

4261
02:49:49,540 --> 02:49:50,560
Think about it.

4262
02:49:54,760 --> 02:49:55,280
Alright.

4263
02:49:56,180 --> 02:49:56,700
F.

4264
02:49:59,380 --> 02:49:59,900
Alright.

4265
02:50:00,180 --> 02:50:01,760
Wait, there is more stuff here.

4266
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:03,760
Oh, I'm gonna go up!

4267
02:50:06,940 --> 02:50:07,380
Where?

4268
02:50:10,640 --> 02:50:11,080
Where?

4269
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:12,080
Where?

4270
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:12,540
Oh, shit.

4271
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:12,800
There!

4272
02:50:15,080 --> 02:50:15,520
Where?

4273
02:50:17,180 --> 02:50:18,340
I can't see!

4274
02:50:19,060 --> 02:50:21,300
I can't see!!!

4275
02:50:25,660 --> 02:50:26,100
Okay.

4276
02:50:26,260 --> 02:50:26,860
We're gonna shoot it here.

4277
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:28,060
Oh god!

4278
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:28,480
Oh god!

4279
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:30,300
There you go.

4280
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:30,700
We got him.

4281
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:34,140
Where is he?

4282
02:50:53,150 --> 02:51:06,950
Oh, there he is.

4283
02:51:08,570 --> 02:51:09,330
Oh, god.

4284
02:51:09,710 --> 02:51:10,730
Does that hit him?

4285
02:51:11,150 --> 02:51:12,550
Doesn't it hit him?!

4286
02:51:12,990 --> 02:51:13,810
This is bullshit.

4287
02:51:15,230 --> 02:51:16,550
This is so bullshit.

4288
02:51:16,870 --> 02:51:17,930
Oh my god, what the fuck?

4289
02:51:18,010 --> 02:51:18,790
Where did you come from?

4290
02:51:22,580 --> 02:51:23,220
Oh, god.

4291
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:28,280
God.

4292
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:29,580
Get out.

4293
02:51:30,460 --> 02:51:31,100
Get out!

4294
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:34,900
Get out!

4295
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:36,920
Is he dead?

4296
02:51:37,240 --> 02:51:38,140
He must be dead.

4297
02:51:40,220 --> 02:51:41,100
Oh shit!

4298
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:42,240
Where did you come from?

4299
02:51:44,020 --> 02:51:44,460
Okay.

4300
02:51:44,460 --> 02:51:44,900
Dodged.

4301
02:51:45,820 --> 02:51:46,260
Chink.

4302
02:51:46,340 --> 02:51:46,780
Chink.

4303
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:47,860
Kick you out of here!

4304
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:49,740
You know what?

4305
02:51:49,820 --> 02:51:50,220
Chink.

4306
02:51:50,220 --> 02:51:50,640
Chink.

4307
02:51:50,660 --> 02:51:51,060
Chink.

4308
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:51,620
Chink.

4309
02:51:51,880 --> 02:51:52,320
Kick!

4310
02:51:53,020 --> 02:51:53,700
There we go.

4311
02:51:55,800 --> 02:51:56,540
You know what?

4312
02:51:56,600 --> 02:51:57,820
I don't even need a waist...

4313
02:51:57,820 --> 02:51:58,660
Oh shit!

4314
02:51:58,740 --> 02:51:59,060
You know what?

4315
02:51:59,360 --> 02:51:59,960
Fuck this.

4316
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:00,540
Chink.

4317
02:52:00,540 --> 02:52:00,920
Chink.

4318
02:52:00,980 --> 02:52:01,400
Chink.

4319
02:52:01,520 --> 02:52:01,880
Chink.

4320
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:04,860
It's fine.

4321
02:52:05,960 --> 02:52:06,660
It's fine.

4322
02:52:06,660 --> 02:52:08,220
We don't need... It's fine!

4323
02:52:08,760 --> 02:52:09,800
It's fine.

4324
02:52:10,780 --> 02:52:12,140
Just stab!

4325
02:52:12,740 --> 02:52:14,240
Just stab!

4326
02:52:15,140 --> 02:52:16,080
There we go.

4327
02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:17,900
I told you it's fine.

4328
02:52:18,340 --> 02:52:20,980
We don't need guns in this house.

4329
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:24,060
Anything can be a weapon.

4330
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:27,820
Okay, I need a fucking craft shotgun ammo.

4331
02:52:29,420 --> 02:52:31,140
Stabbing will always work!

4332
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:34,280
Alright.

4333
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:36,540
How did I waste ammo?

4334
02:52:39,220 --> 02:52:40,900
Just keep stabbing.

4335
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:41,980
Just keep stabbing.

4336
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:46,100
Whoa.

4337
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:48,360
Fuck.

4338
02:52:51,520 --> 02:52:52,040
Alright.

4339
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:52,320
Oh.

4340
02:52:52,460 --> 02:52:53,100
What's this?

4341
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:55,800
At the entrance?

4342
02:52:57,720 --> 02:52:58,520
Is that it?

4343
02:53:02,300 --> 02:53:04,160
You think I can land my egg throw here?

4344
02:53:08,220 --> 02:53:11,120
Bro, I'm gonna miss... I know I'm gonna miss the throw.

4345
02:53:12,700 --> 02:53:14,980
It's gonna be like so fucking sad.

4346
02:53:15,740 --> 02:53:16,140
Recycle!

4347
02:53:16,360 --> 02:53:17,160
Thank you for the super chat.

4348
02:53:17,220 --> 02:53:17,480
Thank you.

4349
02:53:17,500 --> 02:53:18,020
Thank you.

4350
02:53:18,880 --> 02:53:19,660
Hello, Doki.

4351
02:53:19,820 --> 02:53:21,480
It's been a busy week for me.

4352
02:53:21,820 --> 02:53:23,600
That can only be a VOD game.

4353
02:53:23,720 --> 02:53:26,060
But I finally chased all the VODs that can watch you live!

4354
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:26,740
Yeah!

4355
02:53:27,160 --> 02:53:28,240
Thank you for the super chat.

4356
02:53:28,520 --> 02:53:29,200
Chat, thank you.

4357
02:53:29,220 --> 02:53:29,700
Thank you.

4358
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:31,320
It's okay.

4359
02:53:31,460 --> 02:53:33,160
You're gonna watch me finish this game today.

4360
02:53:34,380 --> 02:53:35,100
This way.

4361
02:53:37,220 --> 02:53:37,740
Bomb.

4362
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:38,180
Whoa.

4363
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:40,500
Okay, we don't look down.

4364
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:41,120
We'll be fine.

4365
02:53:41,800 --> 02:53:42,320
BOMB!

4366
02:53:47,990 --> 02:53:49,310
Guys, we weren't fine.

4367
02:53:53,930 --> 02:53:54,450
Guys.

4368
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:03,180
Guys, we were not fine.

4369
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:05,620
We were not fine.

4370
02:54:06,820 --> 02:54:09,140
Guys, I looked down.

4371
02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:11,040
Guys.

4372
02:54:17,140 --> 02:54:17,840
Okay.

4373
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:19,420
Okay, we don't run.

4374
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:20,860
Now we know.

4375
02:54:21,100 --> 02:54:22,920
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

4376
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:25,540
Okay.

4377
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:26,760
We walk.

4378
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:29,940
We walk.

4379
02:54:31,180 --> 02:54:32,900
We're walking now.

4380
02:54:33,860 --> 02:54:35,600
We've learned our lesson.

4381
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:37,780
Jesus Christ.

4382
02:54:40,680 --> 02:54:41,660
Here we go.

4383
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:45,920
We learned our lesson.

4384
02:54:47,320 --> 02:54:48,320
We walk.

4385
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:51,280
And then we grab this too.

4386
02:54:51,780 --> 02:54:52,440
Yay!

4387
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:53,160
Okay.

4388
02:54:53,380 --> 02:54:54,500
We walk.

4389
02:54:55,740 --> 02:54:58,260
We walk so we don't die.

4390
02:54:59,140 --> 02:55:00,080
Wait, what?

4391
02:55:00,420 --> 02:55:01,640
You're still alive?

4392
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:04,380
Are you still alive?

4393
02:55:05,860 --> 02:55:06,760
Oh, hey.

4394
02:55:07,480 --> 02:55:08,120
Hello.

4395
02:55:09,580 --> 02:55:10,500
Alright, nice.

4396
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:11,880
Oh, thank God you have yellow herbs.

4397
02:55:12,700 --> 02:55:13,340
Oh!

4398
02:55:14,060 --> 02:55:16,280
We can actually make shit.

4399
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:19,640
Alright.

4400
02:55:20,180 --> 02:55:21,400
I need a cell.

4401
02:55:23,300 --> 02:55:25,180
This and then...

4402
02:55:25,180 --> 02:55:26,360
Oh shit, nope.

4403
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:28,640
And then...

4404
02:55:28,640 --> 02:55:30,580
Wait, actually we can...

4405
02:55:30,580 --> 02:55:32,780
Let's just combine this for now.

4406
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:34,360
I have a red one.

4407
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:36,080
Red and also a red.

4408
02:55:36,140 --> 02:55:36,840
That's double, right?

4409
02:55:36,980 --> 02:55:37,240
Yeah.

4410
02:55:37,280 --> 02:55:38,040
Times two.

4411
02:55:39,780 --> 02:55:40,820
1.2.

4412
02:55:41,020 --> 02:55:42,360
Yeah, the double reds.

4413
02:55:44,820 --> 02:55:45,340
Alright.

4414
02:55:45,480 --> 02:55:47,200
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

4415
02:55:47,980 --> 02:55:48,500
Boop.

4416
02:55:48,780 --> 02:55:51,440
Uh, tune up.

4417
02:55:52,400 --> 02:55:52,920
Okay.

4418
02:55:53,380 --> 02:55:57,260
Repair our knives because we've been fucking around too much with that.

4419
02:55:59,480 --> 02:56:03,180
We've been messing around with that a bit too much.

4420
02:56:03,660 --> 02:56:04,180
Alright.

4421
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:04,340
Let's go.

4422
02:56:04,340 --> 02:56:04,740
Alright, let's see.

4423
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:05,840
We have to repair.

4424
02:56:06,960 --> 02:56:07,760
You know what?

4425
02:56:08,640 --> 02:56:09,680
Let us...

4426
02:56:10,720 --> 02:56:12,860
Let us power up our knife.

4427
02:56:13,400 --> 02:56:16,740
And then we'll upgrade our...

4428
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:18,740
We'll upgrade our shotgun actually.

4429
02:56:19,540 --> 02:56:20,420
Ammo capacity.

4430
02:56:21,400 --> 02:56:21,600
There we go.

4431
02:56:22,900 --> 02:56:23,420
Save.

4432
02:56:26,680 --> 02:56:27,200
Alright.

4433
02:56:27,460 --> 02:56:27,980
Fine.

4434
02:56:28,660 --> 02:56:29,400
Everything's fine.

4435
02:56:29,560 --> 02:56:30,320
Up we go.

4436
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:34,320
I don't think I have enough to max this.

4437
02:56:34,340 --> 02:56:34,940
I don't think I have enough to max the knife yet.

4438
02:56:35,080 --> 02:56:36,140
I'm like so poor.

4439
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:39,720
I'm pretty sure.

4440
02:56:43,470 --> 02:56:45,430
Do I have enough to upgrade the knife?

4441
02:56:45,710 --> 02:56:46,450
Let me double check.

4442
02:56:48,490 --> 02:56:48,970
So...

4443
02:56:48,970 --> 02:56:49,770
Oh no.

4444
02:56:50,110 --> 02:56:50,590
Tune...

4445
02:56:50,590 --> 02:56:50,830
No.

4446
02:56:50,930 --> 02:56:51,470
Tune up.

4447
02:56:52,030 --> 02:56:52,510
Uh...

4448
02:56:52,510 --> 02:56:52,990
Oh, I can!

4449
02:56:53,190 --> 02:56:54,610
I can full upgrade it.

4450
02:56:55,870 --> 02:56:56,830
Increase attack...

4451
02:56:56,830 --> 02:56:57,330
Guys!

4452
02:56:57,450 --> 02:56:58,410
Okay, but like...

4453
02:56:58,950 --> 02:57:00,250
Do I need to?

4454
02:57:01,070 --> 02:57:03,150
Guys, I'm ready to save up for this.

4455
02:57:03,270 --> 02:57:04,470
I'm gonna save up for the magnum.

4456
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:06,190
I feel like...

4457
02:57:07,590 --> 02:57:09,150
I'm gonna save up for the magnum.

4458
02:57:09,230 --> 02:57:10,710
Because I feel like I'm not gonna...

4459
02:57:10,710 --> 02:57:13,150
I'm gonna use that more in the end.

4460
02:57:13,290 --> 02:57:13,730
Because...

4461
02:57:13,730 --> 02:57:14,950
Oh, I missed the box up here?

4462
02:57:15,490 --> 02:57:16,950
How could I miss a chest?

4463
02:57:18,270 --> 02:57:19,590
Yeah, what the fuck do you mean?

4464
02:57:19,770 --> 02:57:20,350
I got everything.

4465
02:57:21,290 --> 02:57:21,890
What do you mean?

4466
02:57:24,570 --> 02:57:25,610
I got everything.

4467
02:57:26,090 --> 02:57:27,350
There's no painted yellow.

4468
02:57:29,570 --> 02:57:30,870
That thing's painted yellow.

4469
02:57:32,170 --> 02:57:34,550
Believe in the power of the shank.

4470
02:57:35,770 --> 02:57:39,290
Yeah, I'm saving up for the boss fight!

4471
02:57:39,490 --> 02:57:41,070
That's why I don't use it!

4472
02:57:42,770 --> 02:57:46,310
It's all about the boss fight's chat!

4473
02:57:49,790 --> 02:57:52,030
It's about the boss fight.

4474
02:57:53,390 --> 02:57:54,910
I'm investing...

4475
02:57:54,910 --> 02:57:56,170
For long term.

4476
02:57:57,230 --> 02:58:02,750
And so I have delivered the girl to you as promised.

4477
02:58:03,130 --> 02:58:04,530
Bye, girl!

4478
02:58:16,370 --> 02:58:18,010
Oh shit.

4479
02:58:18,410 --> 02:58:19,490
Don't worry!

4480
02:58:19,750 --> 02:58:21,650
I have a fucking egg!

4481
02:58:35,830 --> 02:58:37,430
Shoot the head Leon!

4482
02:58:39,090 --> 02:58:39,570
Oh!

4483
02:58:40,010 --> 02:58:41,590
I told you!

4484
02:58:41,670 --> 02:58:42,310
Shoot the head!

4485
02:58:42,650 --> 02:58:44,230
That should have been your first shot Leon.

4486
02:58:47,610 --> 02:58:48,290
Oh man.

4487
02:58:49,090 --> 02:58:51,110
That's not a bad thing down there.

4488
02:58:53,110 --> 02:58:55,270
Surely it's nothing dangerous.

4489
02:59:00,870 --> 02:59:02,810
Egg and then magma.

4490
02:59:02,870 --> 02:59:04,170
If you miss.

4491
02:59:05,730 --> 02:59:07,510
I'm gonna miss.

4492
02:59:08,110 --> 02:59:09,910
I'm gonna miss.

4493
02:59:14,530 --> 02:59:15,290
Okay.

4494
02:59:15,290 --> 02:59:16,490
This is it!

4495
02:59:18,290 --> 02:59:19,570
This is it!

4496
02:59:21,350 --> 02:59:22,830
I missed.

4497
02:59:23,130 --> 02:59:24,110
I missed!

4498
02:59:35,720 --> 02:59:36,650
I missed!

4499
02:59:39,390 --> 02:59:39,410
How?

4500
02:59:43,110 --> 02:59:45,550
I told you!

4501
02:59:45,770 --> 02:59:49,050
I told you I needed practice eggs!

4502
02:59:49,230 --> 02:59:52,090
But nobody believed me!

4503
02:59:55,370 --> 03:00:00,070
Nobody believed me when I said I needed a practice egg!

4504
03:00:03,800 --> 03:00:07,010
None of you thought I needed a practice egg!

4505
03:00:10,660 --> 03:00:13,250
Why did no one ever believe me?

4506
03:00:18,010 --> 03:00:19,950
Anything is possible!

4507
03:00:22,730 --> 03:00:25,910
You know anything was possible!

4508
03:00:27,770 --> 03:00:29,590
I can miss!

4509
03:00:30,350 --> 03:00:31,710
What would others think of you?

4510
03:00:35,390 --> 03:00:37,510
I can't believe it.

4511
03:00:38,470 --> 03:00:39,170
I'm sorry!

4512
03:00:39,170 --> 03:00:40,110
I'm sorry doing it!

4513
03:00:40,150 --> 03:00:40,710
It's too late!

4514
03:00:42,830 --> 03:00:45,690
We have to accept our consequences!

4515
03:00:48,570 --> 03:00:49,370
Guys!

4516
03:00:49,610 --> 03:00:53,110
We have to accept our mistakes chat!

4517
03:00:53,290 --> 03:00:56,770
We can't just reload it whenever we want.

4518
03:00:57,050 --> 03:00:57,450
It's not.

4519
03:00:57,650 --> 03:01:00,650
We can't just Baldur's Gate this!

4520
03:01:01,350 --> 03:01:02,030
Ha!

4521
03:01:02,030 --> 03:01:02,430
Ha!

4522
03:01:02,430 --> 03:01:02,870
Ha!

4523
03:01:02,870 --> 03:01:03,170
Ahahaha!

4524
03:01:13,930 --> 03:01:15,870
I can't believe I missed.

4525
03:01:16,190 --> 03:01:18,030
I can't believe it.

4526
03:01:18,650 --> 03:01:21,470
I can't believe I fucking missed.

4527
03:01:26,390 --> 03:01:32,450
Oh my god, I can't believe I fucking missed the egg.

4528
03:01:32,670 --> 03:01:33,170
How?

4529
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:35,430
How did that happen?

4530
03:01:37,090 --> 03:01:38,290
What do you mean?

4531
03:01:38,410 --> 03:01:41,070
Look, this is a group effort chat.

4532
03:01:41,230 --> 03:01:42,910
This is a group effort.

4533
03:01:43,310 --> 03:01:46,050
You didn't give me enough information.

4534
03:01:51,470 --> 03:01:53,370
I can't believe it.

4535
03:01:54,150 --> 03:01:56,790
You could have given me more information.

4536
03:01:58,090 --> 03:01:59,330
It's not my fault.

4537
03:01:59,790 --> 03:02:03,330
I was going in there with a lack of info.

4538
03:02:03,610 --> 03:02:05,590
The lack of intel chat.

4539
03:02:07,650 --> 03:02:10,130
This is a group effort chat.

4540
03:02:10,290 --> 03:02:12,410
We both fucked up together.

4541
03:02:13,390 --> 03:02:18,610
We fucked up together chat.

4542
03:02:21,470 --> 03:02:22,450
Alright, here we go.

4543
03:02:25,090 --> 03:02:25,870
It's fine.

4544
03:02:26,010 --> 03:02:26,750
We're okay.

4545
03:02:29,790 --> 03:02:32,430
Since when was this a group effort?

4546
03:02:32,870 --> 03:02:34,810
The contract is subscribing.

4547
03:02:36,310 --> 03:02:37,830
Thank you for the super chat.

4548
03:02:37,910 --> 03:02:38,190
Thank you.

4549
03:02:38,410 --> 03:02:38,810
Thank you.

4550
03:02:39,790 --> 03:02:40,930
Alright, let's see.

4551
03:02:41,190 --> 03:02:43,810
We gotta figure this out now.

4552
03:02:46,110 --> 03:02:46,650
Okay.

4553
03:02:49,550 --> 03:02:51,270
Okay, we're gonna put this here.

4554
03:02:51,710 --> 03:02:54,170
And then here we go.

4555
03:02:54,330 --> 03:02:54,890
Alright, nice.

4556
03:02:55,230 --> 03:02:56,890
We have another kitchen knife.

4557
03:03:00,290 --> 03:03:03,550
No, the contract is watching the stream chat.

4558
03:03:03,730 --> 03:03:06,650
When you watch the stream, that's the contract.

4559
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:08,610
That's the contract.

4560
03:03:08,670 --> 03:03:11,050
By being here, you've signed.

4561
03:03:14,990 --> 03:03:15,630
Okay.

4562
03:03:15,710 --> 03:03:16,070
Okay.

4563
03:03:16,070 --> 03:03:16,090
Okay.

4564
03:03:16,830 --> 03:03:17,550
Let's see.

4565
03:03:19,610 --> 03:03:20,310
We're fine.

4566
03:03:20,430 --> 03:03:20,750
It's fine.

4567
03:03:20,830 --> 03:03:21,490
We killed him.

4568
03:03:21,650 --> 03:03:22,470
We killed him.

4569
03:03:26,610 --> 03:03:27,810
We killed him.

4570
03:03:27,970 --> 03:03:31,650
Lord Corrosus, hit the target five feet away from you.

4571
03:03:31,810 --> 03:03:32,610
Instructions unclear.

4572
03:03:33,110 --> 03:03:33,590
Mistake.

4573
03:03:33,630 --> 03:03:36,270
You guys could have told me to get closer.

4574
03:03:38,030 --> 03:03:39,710
I didn't know it was five feet.

4575
03:03:39,950 --> 03:03:42,350
I was six feet away chat.

4576
03:03:42,810 --> 03:03:44,250
You guys should have said five feet.

4577
03:03:44,250 --> 03:03:46,430
I would have walked up a little bit.

4578
03:03:47,490 --> 03:03:48,650
And that is why.

4579
03:03:48,670 --> 03:03:49,770
This is a group mistake.

4580
03:03:50,510 --> 03:03:57,470
I was lacking information to walk closer up to get closer.

4581
03:03:57,750 --> 03:03:59,930
And because of that...

4582
03:04:02,190 --> 03:04:03,350
No, no, no.

4583
03:04:03,650 --> 03:04:08,170
If you told me it was within five feet, I would have walked closer.

4584
03:04:08,470 --> 03:04:10,270
I was within six feet.

4585
03:04:10,330 --> 03:04:11,170
I was six feet away.

4586
03:04:12,010 --> 03:04:13,250
I was six feet away chat.

4587
03:04:14,930 --> 03:04:17,470
I did not count for the wind.

4588
03:04:18,510 --> 03:04:21,310
I also did not account for the wind.

4589
03:04:21,610 --> 03:04:27,010
How was I supposed to know the wind was going to change the trajectory of my egg.

4590
03:04:28,130 --> 03:04:31,130
And then there's the weight of the Golden Egg as well.

4591
03:04:31,490 --> 03:04:34,750
Golden Egg is heavier than a normal egg.

4592
03:04:35,350 --> 03:04:35,490
And...

4593
03:04:35,490 --> 03:04:39,930
I should have been painted yellow.

4594
03:04:40,210 --> 03:04:42,250
I have failed you my Lord.

4595
03:04:42,590 --> 03:04:43,190
OK.

4596
03:04:43,190 --> 03:04:49,690
I was unable to fulfill your final commandment and keep the boy from the path of wickedness.

4597
03:04:49,850 --> 03:04:54,590
I caught a glimpse of Master Ramon's evil temperament during his younger years.

4598
03:04:54,910 --> 03:05:01,430
When he discovered a servant mocked him by uttering whatever the fuck this is behind his back.

4599
03:05:01,610 --> 03:05:03,690
He summoned her to his private chambers.

4600
03:05:03,950 --> 03:05:11,370
After forcing her to kneel before him, Ramon dosed her face with a viral overt ritual he pulled out of his pocket.

4601
03:05:11,370 --> 03:05:19,630
The young master watched with glee when the servant writhed in agony as the skin melted from her face.

4602
03:05:20,310 --> 03:05:24,650
His twisted grim still haunts my dreams this very day.

4603
03:05:24,950 --> 03:05:33,230
As time passed, Ramon's treachery only deepened, and the infernal cult soon learned they could prey upon his vulnerable heart.

4604
03:05:33,530 --> 03:05:35,310
Curse the fiends!

4605
03:05:35,310 --> 03:05:39,510
They manipulated Master Ramon and turned him into their puppet.

4606
03:05:39,850 --> 03:05:49,830
Worst of all, they managed to use him to unleash the les plagas that the Salazar family has fought so long and hard to keep sealed away.

4607
03:05:50,270 --> 03:05:59,210
Lord Diego, rest assured, I intend to watch over Master Ramon until the very end, whatever fate may befall us.

4608
03:05:59,410 --> 03:06:06,290
As a faithful servant of the Salazar family since birth, it is my duty and my penance to you.

4609
03:06:06,650 --> 03:06:08,850
Alright, pretty sure that housekeeper is dead.

4610
03:06:09,290 --> 03:06:10,870
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

4611
03:06:10,990 --> 03:06:11,710
Thank you, thank you.

4612
03:06:11,870 --> 03:06:14,570
Sounds like grade S copium.

4613
03:06:14,730 --> 03:06:17,950
Look, it is not my fault that the...

4614
03:06:19,010 --> 03:06:24,730
That the fucking gold egg is heavier than a normal egg, chat.

4615
03:06:24,870 --> 03:06:26,250
That is not my fault.

4616
03:06:26,310 --> 03:06:34,890
How was I supposed to know that the gold egg was heavier and thus changes the grip of my egg?

4617
03:06:35,070 --> 03:06:37,930
So like I ended up throwing it too...

4618
03:06:37,930 --> 03:06:38,490
Too...

4619
03:06:38,490 --> 03:06:40,970
I ended up throwing it too lightly.

4620
03:06:40,990 --> 03:06:43,210
I didn't compensate my strength.

4621
03:06:44,310 --> 03:06:46,750
To throw a golden egg.

4622
03:06:51,690 --> 03:06:53,170
I didn't account.

4623
03:06:53,510 --> 03:06:56,870
I didn't figure out... I couldn't figure out the math in my head.

4624
03:06:57,430 --> 03:07:00,150
I used like normal egg in my head.

4625
03:07:03,870 --> 03:07:05,450
He is dead.

4626
03:07:05,890 --> 03:07:07,310
He is dead.

4627
03:07:12,810 --> 03:07:14,070
I am looking for the key.

4628
03:07:14,350 --> 03:07:14,510
Yeah, I am looking for the key.

4629
03:07:19,290 --> 03:07:20,830
Yeah, I did it.

4630
03:07:22,230 --> 03:07:24,230
I think this has to be my worst day.

4631
03:07:26,370 --> 03:07:28,810
10% of that was from the egg throw.

4632
03:07:31,510 --> 03:07:33,330
That is where the egg was.

4633
03:07:36,570 --> 03:07:37,450
Alright, nice.

4634
03:07:53,970 --> 03:07:55,410
1N, thank you for the super chat.

4635
03:07:55,470 --> 03:07:55,770
Thank you.

4636
03:07:55,770 --> 03:07:56,310
Thank you.

4637
03:07:56,310 --> 03:07:59,090
We are not responsible for final calculations of the employer.

4638
03:07:59,190 --> 03:08:00,530
Only the first estimate.

4639
03:08:01,150 --> 03:08:02,170
Thank you for the super chat.

4640
03:08:02,250 --> 03:08:02,490
Thank you.

4641
03:08:02,630 --> 03:08:02,990
Thank you.

4642
03:08:03,290 --> 03:08:05,030
But I don't think I will get a straight answer.

4643
03:08:09,410 --> 03:08:10,830
Yeah, she doesn't care about you.

4644
03:08:10,950 --> 03:08:12,450
She is only here for the money.

4645
03:08:13,550 --> 03:08:16,890
You know after the incident, the world changed.

4646
03:08:18,430 --> 03:08:25,230
Maybe if you used more grenades, you would have more experience with the weight of a metal shaped object.

4647
03:08:27,990 --> 03:08:28,730
Leon S.

4648
03:08:28,830 --> 03:08:29,130
Kennedy.

4649
03:08:30,610 --> 03:08:31,790
You haven't changed.

4650
03:08:33,490 --> 03:08:34,830
You just think you have.

4651
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:43,640
So here is my question.

4652
03:08:43,880 --> 03:08:45,720
Chris, thank you for the super chat.

4653
03:08:45,800 --> 03:08:46,600
Thank you.

4654
03:08:46,820 --> 03:08:47,100
Have you changed?

4655
03:08:47,420 --> 03:08:51,940
You will never be able to punch rocks with a whimpy throwing arm like that.

4656
03:08:53,380 --> 03:08:54,340
What do you think?

4657
03:08:54,560 --> 03:08:56,000
This is why I don't punch rocks.

4658
03:08:56,080 --> 03:08:56,740
I kick them.

4659
03:08:57,240 --> 03:08:57,760
We are here.

4660
03:08:57,760 --> 03:08:58,640
See those thighs?

4661
03:09:00,560 --> 03:09:03,760
If I could have kicked the egg, I would have made it.

4662
03:09:04,440 --> 03:09:05,660
She called me handsome.

4663
03:09:05,860 --> 03:09:06,060
See you later.

4664
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:07,620
Oh my god.

4665
03:09:07,640 --> 03:09:08,520
New girlfriend.

4666
03:09:08,740 --> 03:09:09,400
Right there.

4667
03:09:13,120 --> 03:09:14,140
Story of my life.

4668
03:09:15,280 --> 03:09:17,480
Guys, it's because I didn't kick the egg.

4669
03:09:18,120 --> 03:09:19,160
That was my problem.

4670
03:09:19,580 --> 03:09:22,780
If I could have kicked the egg, I would have hit it.

4671
03:09:23,480 --> 03:09:25,600
I would have hit the target.

4672
03:09:31,440 --> 03:09:33,020
New old girlfriend.

4673
03:09:34,380 --> 03:09:35,440
That was the issue.

4674
03:09:41,240 --> 03:09:42,620
Wait, is that a machine gun?

4675
03:09:49,390 --> 03:09:49,790
Okay,

4676
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:55,840
that's a lot of machine guns.

4677
03:09:55,960 --> 03:09:56,400
Can I...

4678
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:58,540
Okay, this is a lot of machine guns.

4679
03:09:59,400 --> 03:10:02,540
Okay, can I just snipe them from here?

4680
03:10:04,980 --> 03:10:05,980
Yeah, I can, right?

4681
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:12,120
How the fuck did that man live through that?

4682
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:15,980
Okay, nice.

4683
03:10:16,200 --> 03:10:17,400
Well, I got this guy out.

4684
03:10:20,680 --> 03:10:22,280
I knew I should have had a second...

4685
03:10:22,280 --> 03:10:23,580
I knew I should have had a third egg.

4686
03:10:23,820 --> 03:10:24,640
I knew...

4687
03:10:27,740 --> 03:10:30,120
I fucking knew I needed a third egg.

4688
03:10:30,620 --> 03:10:31,660
I knew it.

4689
03:10:32,120 --> 03:10:35,440
You guys were like, no, you just need one egg.

4690
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:36,680
And I was like, no way.

4691
03:10:36,860 --> 03:10:38,060
Can I like just destroy it?

4692
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:39,340
I can't shoot it?

4693
03:10:41,120 --> 03:10:42,320
How the fuck do I get out?

4694
03:10:42,320 --> 03:10:44,080
How the fuck do I not die from this?

4695
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:48,420
I just have to walk the other way.

4696
03:10:49,380 --> 03:10:50,820
I can't believe it.

4697
03:10:50,820 --> 03:10:51,980
I can't just shoot things.

4698
03:10:53,400 --> 03:10:54,900
This is so fucked up.

4699
03:10:57,080 --> 03:10:58,520
This is so fucked up.

4700
03:10:58,540 --> 03:10:59,580
I can't just shoot it.

4701
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:07,780
What's the point if I can't just shoot it?

4702
03:11:11,790 --> 03:11:12,490
Oh, it's a merchant.

4703
03:11:12,490 --> 03:11:12,610
Oh, it's over here.

4704
03:11:12,690 --> 03:11:13,310
Oh, it's a merchant!

4705
03:11:16,070 --> 03:11:17,430
Is there anything else?

4706
03:11:17,630 --> 03:11:20,130
Oh, I need that, actually.

4707
03:11:20,530 --> 03:11:21,950
Good thing I saved up.

4708
03:11:23,130 --> 03:11:24,570
That's good, I saved up there.

4709
03:11:26,490 --> 03:11:27,330
Anything new?

4710
03:11:27,450 --> 03:11:27,950
The killer.

4711
03:11:28,730 --> 03:11:31,130
My pistol is still the best pistol, right?

4712
03:11:33,410 --> 03:11:33,850
64.

4713
03:11:34,010 --> 03:11:35,790
Okay, we need the case.

4714
03:11:36,950 --> 03:11:38,710
And yeah, I think that's all we need.

4715
03:11:42,070 --> 03:11:43,790
Oh, Killer7 is the magnum?

4716
03:11:43,950 --> 03:11:45,230
Okay, I can't afford it though.

4717
03:11:46,090 --> 03:11:47,310
I can sell this now.

4718
03:11:47,490 --> 03:11:48,290
Okay, nice.

4719
03:11:48,390 --> 03:11:49,570
And I can sell this too.

4720
03:11:51,870 --> 03:11:52,710
Alright, bye!

4721
03:11:53,310 --> 03:11:54,690
I'm gonna buy the case upgrade.

4722
03:11:58,690 --> 03:11:59,130
Okay.

4723
03:11:59,130 --> 03:12:00,250
Do I have junk?

4724
03:12:00,430 --> 03:12:00,910
Oh, I do.

4725
03:12:01,190 --> 03:12:03,110
I have ammo I don't need.

4726
03:12:03,110 --> 03:12:08,270
Uh, flash grenade... first aid...

4727
03:12:09,110 --> 03:12:10,470
Okay, never mind.

4728
03:12:10,590 --> 03:12:11,030
I don't.

4729
03:12:11,610 --> 03:12:13,530
Everything is useful.

4730
03:12:15,890 --> 03:12:17,210
Sell Ashley.

4731
03:12:17,570 --> 03:12:19,830
I don't even have Ashley anymore!

4732
03:12:21,310 --> 03:12:22,670
There's treasure here.

4733
03:12:23,170 --> 03:12:24,050
Bats.

4734
03:12:24,490 --> 03:12:25,370
Nice.

4735
03:12:27,850 --> 03:12:28,730
Treasure.

4736
03:12:29,570 --> 03:12:30,710
Treasure time!

4737
03:12:33,590 --> 03:12:34,150
Nice.

4738
03:12:34,330 --> 03:12:34,730
Woop!

4739
03:12:35,870 --> 03:12:37,750
Okay, can I... where is it?

4740
03:12:38,270 --> 03:12:39,470
Where the fuck's the treasure?

4741
03:12:42,270 --> 03:12:43,650
Where the fuck's the treasure?

4742
03:12:44,530 --> 03:12:45,090
Treasure?

4743
03:12:47,710 --> 03:12:48,770
I'm looking up.

4744
03:12:49,010 --> 03:12:49,790
Is it down?

4745
03:12:52,270 --> 03:12:53,650
Where the fuck's the treasure?

4746
03:12:55,250 --> 03:12:55,810
Hello?

4747
03:12:56,190 --> 03:12:57,110
Oh, it's here!

4748
03:12:58,510 --> 03:12:59,710
How do I look at that?

4749
03:13:00,250 --> 03:13:02,290
Oh my god, do not throw the nade.

4750
03:13:05,550 --> 03:13:07,110
How the fuck do I...

4751
03:13:08,050 --> 03:13:08,650
What?

4752
03:13:10,390 --> 03:13:11,710
How did I read that?

4753
03:13:13,430 --> 03:13:14,590
What the fuck?

4754
03:13:15,690 --> 03:13:16,910
Oh, it's for later?

4755
03:13:17,110 --> 03:13:17,550
Oh, okay.

4756
03:13:19,910 --> 03:13:21,790
Where the fuck is that treasure?

4757
03:13:22,370 --> 03:13:24,830
Tres-throwing the egg.

4758
03:13:30,470 --> 03:13:33,090
Not everything needs to be in the treasure chest.

4759
03:13:33,090 --> 03:13:33,470
I'm gonna throw an egg.

4760
03:13:37,450 --> 03:13:39,130
Will it be fine if I just kill him here?

4761
03:13:41,270 --> 03:13:41,890
There you go.

4762
03:13:46,930 --> 03:13:47,810
Okay, there he is.

4763
03:13:48,870 --> 03:13:50,330
I can just...

4764
03:13:50,330 --> 03:13:50,750
Woah!

4765
03:13:51,330 --> 03:13:52,270
He got back up!

4766
03:13:52,450 --> 03:13:52,930
It's fine.

4767
03:13:54,810 --> 03:13:55,390
It's fine.

4768
03:13:55,450 --> 03:13:56,810
I can literally just stay here.

4769
03:13:57,410 --> 03:13:58,390
They just come to me.

4770
03:13:59,070 --> 03:14:00,070
Oh my god.

4771
03:14:00,170 --> 03:14:01,050
Okay, they're all...

4772
03:14:01,610 --> 03:14:02,910
They're all insect heads.

4773
03:14:06,410 --> 03:14:07,790
I'm gonna go ahead and just throw the heads.

4774
03:14:07,790 --> 03:14:08,130
This is it!

4775
03:14:08,170 --> 03:14:09,970
This is your chance to practice throwing!

4776
03:14:10,950 --> 03:14:12,550
I don't need practice to throw.

4777
03:14:12,730 --> 03:14:13,750
I do it every day.

4778
03:14:14,270 --> 03:14:15,510
Oh, fuck!

4779
03:14:16,670 --> 03:14:16,950
What?

4780
03:14:17,450 --> 03:14:18,770
Now they know I...

4781
03:14:23,340 --> 03:14:27,880
Guys, you're trying to tell me I was supposed to do this stealthily?

4782
03:14:28,500 --> 03:14:29,820
There's no way.

4783
03:14:31,420 --> 03:14:35,060
There's no way this was supposed to be done stealth-wise.

4784
03:14:37,340 --> 03:14:38,460
This is it!

4785
03:14:44,480 --> 03:14:48,060
There's no way I was supposed to do this stealthily!

4786
03:14:52,390 --> 03:14:53,630
Who would've thought?

4787
03:14:54,990 --> 03:14:56,450
Who would've thought?

4788
03:14:56,690 --> 03:14:58,610
Chat, this is where all the nays are for.

4789
03:14:59,170 --> 03:15:00,730
This is it, guys!

4790
03:15:01,870 --> 03:15:04,110
I told you it was useful!

4791
03:15:10,300 --> 03:15:11,960
It was useful!

4792
03:15:11,980 --> 03:15:13,040
I knew it!

4793
03:15:15,480 --> 03:15:16,660
What the fuck?!

4794
03:15:16,660 --> 03:15:17,500
Oh my god!

4795
03:15:20,420 --> 03:15:21,880
Can I just kill him from here?

4796
03:15:22,240 --> 03:15:22,860
Here we go.

4797
03:15:23,820 --> 03:15:24,420
It's fine.

4798
03:15:24,500 --> 03:15:25,440
I can kill him from here.

4799
03:15:25,740 --> 03:15:26,520
Oh, he's dead.

4800
03:15:26,660 --> 03:15:27,160
That was it.

4801
03:15:27,800 --> 03:15:28,340
That's it.

4802
03:15:29,080 --> 03:15:29,520
See?

4803
03:15:29,800 --> 03:15:31,600
Look, I didn't waste any ammo.

4804
03:15:33,320 --> 03:15:34,040
Look at that.

4805
03:15:36,220 --> 03:15:37,360
I told you!

4806
03:15:37,420 --> 03:15:37,760
I told you!

4807
03:15:37,780 --> 03:15:38,320
I told you!

4808
03:15:38,400 --> 03:15:38,600
See?

4809
03:15:38,800 --> 03:15:39,160
Look at that!

4810
03:15:39,420 --> 03:15:41,280
I knew that egg throw...

4811
03:15:41,280 --> 03:15:44,940
That egg throw made me better at egging people.

4812
03:15:52,740 --> 03:16:00,380
I like to think throwing those eggs made me better at throwing grenades.

4813
03:16:00,900 --> 03:16:02,240
That was the practice.

4814
03:16:05,280 --> 03:16:06,960
That was what was for practice.

4815
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:09,160
I am so fucked.

4816
03:16:09,240 --> 03:16:09,740
Oh, thank god.

4817
03:16:09,780 --> 03:16:10,000
Okay.

4818
03:16:10,340 --> 03:16:10,580
Oh, thank god.

4819
03:16:10,580 --> 03:16:10,580
Okay.

4820
03:16:12,480 --> 03:16:13,980
Are you still... there's still people?

4821
03:16:19,510 --> 03:16:20,250
There we go.

4822
03:16:20,430 --> 03:16:21,290
There, he can burn.

4823
03:16:21,610 --> 03:16:22,890
He's not burning?!

4824
03:16:22,890 --> 03:16:23,550
What the fuck?!

4825
03:16:24,050 --> 03:16:24,970
Oh, there it is.

4826
03:16:26,050 --> 03:16:27,030
Alright, here we go.

4827
03:16:27,650 --> 03:16:28,090
Woop.

4828
03:16:28,810 --> 03:16:29,510
There we go.

4829
03:16:30,570 --> 03:16:31,010
Woop.

4830
03:16:31,810 --> 03:16:33,330
That's another 10% gone!

4831
03:16:35,430 --> 03:16:37,010
Easy, easy.

4832
03:16:37,250 --> 03:16:38,330
It's okay.

4833
03:16:38,410 --> 03:16:38,910
It's...

4834
03:16:39,390 --> 03:16:41,610
It's like... It's handgun ammo.

4835
03:16:41,770 --> 03:16:42,230
We're fine.

4836
03:16:43,270 --> 03:16:44,870
It's handgun ammo.

4837
03:16:45,230 --> 03:16:46,670
We'll be fine.

4838
03:16:49,650 --> 03:16:53,750
We don't have to worry about handgun ammo, chat.

4839
03:16:56,110 --> 03:16:57,770
We're so healthy.

4840
03:16:58,350 --> 03:17:00,550
We're so fucking healthy.

4841
03:17:05,670 --> 03:17:06,750
Alright, let's see.

4842
03:17:07,090 --> 03:17:07,970
I'm gonna go this way.

4843
03:17:08,530 --> 03:17:09,670
I think I killed everybody.

4844
03:17:11,030 --> 03:17:12,770
I think everybody's just dead.

4845
03:17:13,970 --> 03:17:14,450
Woop.

4846
03:17:18,050 --> 03:17:19,330
Did I just kill everybody?

4847
03:17:20,650 --> 03:17:21,130
Nice.

4848
03:17:23,250 --> 03:17:24,490
Wait, how the fuck...

4849
03:17:24,490 --> 03:17:26,510
How do I get over there?

4850
03:17:27,550 --> 03:17:28,950
Did I disable it already?

4851
03:17:29,110 --> 03:17:29,830
I can't tell!

4852
03:17:33,770 --> 03:17:34,530
See, look!

4853
03:17:34,590 --> 03:17:36,030
I got back some handgun ammo!

4854
03:17:36,150 --> 03:17:37,290
It's like I didn't waste them!

4855
03:17:40,510 --> 03:17:43,210
It's like I never wasted it at all!

4856
03:17:43,390 --> 03:17:44,550
Can I get through here?

4857
03:17:45,030 --> 03:17:47,550
I can't tell if it's scanning me or not!

4858
03:17:50,090 --> 03:17:52,290
Man, that would've been nice to shoot at.

4859
03:17:52,990 --> 03:17:53,690
Oh, wait!

4860
03:17:53,750 --> 03:17:55,010
There's a treasure behind me!

4861
03:17:57,330 --> 03:17:58,290
Where's this treasure?

4862
03:17:58,690 --> 03:18:00,210
It's like right here?

4863
03:18:00,650 --> 03:18:01,690
Oh, here it is!

4864
03:18:02,490 --> 03:18:03,050
Nice.

4865
03:18:05,550 --> 03:18:06,110
See?

4866
03:18:06,270 --> 03:18:12,910
If I didn't kill everybody, I wouldn't have been able to loot freely, chat!

4867
03:18:16,390 --> 03:18:17,570
Look at that!

4868
03:18:18,270 --> 03:18:21,410
Now, I can loot as much as I want!

4869
03:18:23,530 --> 03:18:24,070
See?

4870
03:18:28,490 --> 03:18:30,110
This had to be done!

4871
03:18:32,450 --> 03:18:34,590
I wouldn't be able to do all this looting!

4872
03:18:35,670 --> 03:18:36,670
Why is this yellow?

4873
03:18:36,810 --> 03:18:37,510
Oh, that was originally...

4874
03:18:37,670 --> 03:18:40,230
It's just... actually was supposed to be yellow.

4875
03:18:41,210 --> 03:18:42,490
Alright, is there anything up here?

4876
03:18:45,270 --> 03:18:46,030
Oh, ammo!

4877
03:18:46,330 --> 03:18:47,030
Look at that!

4878
03:18:47,050 --> 03:18:47,790
Never punished!

4879
03:18:48,730 --> 03:18:50,330
I got ammo right here!

4880
03:18:52,310 --> 03:18:53,910
Never punished at all!

4881
03:18:54,910 --> 03:18:56,350
Okay, it's like this way.

4882
03:18:59,070 --> 03:19:00,590
Of course I'm right!

4883
03:19:01,430 --> 03:19:02,990
Oh yeah, the Doki way.

4884
03:19:03,050 --> 03:19:03,690
I told you!

4885
03:19:04,110 --> 03:19:06,870
The Doki way is always the right way!

4886
03:19:07,430 --> 03:19:09,010
Now, where am I?

4887
03:19:11,430 --> 03:19:13,110
We're on the island.

4888
03:19:13,970 --> 03:19:16,250
Okay, how do I get across from this?

4889
03:19:16,930 --> 03:19:18,250
I have to...

4890
03:19:19,150 --> 03:19:21,070
go from here...

4891
03:19:21,070 --> 03:19:22,550
Oh my god, no!

4892
03:19:22,690 --> 03:19:23,510
Not from here!

4893
03:19:23,610 --> 03:19:24,570
I'm getting lost!

4894
03:19:26,990 --> 03:19:29,050
How do I get lost?

4895
03:19:29,710 --> 03:19:30,350
How?

4896
03:19:30,690 --> 03:19:31,950
How do I... How?

4897
03:19:32,610 --> 03:19:33,830
How do I walk from there?

4898
03:19:36,570 --> 03:19:37,050
Uhhh...

4899
03:19:37,050 --> 03:19:38,550
Go all the way back?

4900
03:19:39,670 --> 03:19:40,470
Like this?

4901
03:19:41,010 --> 03:19:42,270
Oh, okay, here we go!

4902
03:19:43,030 --> 03:19:45,030
Sorry, I had to use my brain for once.

4903
03:19:46,110 --> 03:19:49,810
I can't shoot my way out of this.

4904
03:19:50,090 --> 03:19:51,030
God damn it!

4905
03:19:55,210 --> 03:19:56,950
I actually had to think.

4906
03:19:58,090 --> 03:19:59,490
Oh, the misery.

4907
03:20:00,450 --> 03:20:02,190
I can't believe it.

4908
03:20:02,210 --> 03:20:02,610
Thinking.

4909
03:20:05,630 --> 03:20:08,350
I can't just shoot my way out of everything.

4910
03:20:09,570 --> 03:20:10,510
So sad.

4911
03:20:13,070 --> 03:20:13,630
Not...

4912
03:20:13,630 --> 03:20:14,410
Not...

4913
03:20:14,410 --> 03:20:15,910
How could you say that?

4914
03:20:16,050 --> 03:20:18,610
Everything can be shooting if I try hard enough!

4915
03:20:19,950 --> 03:20:22,190
I can't believe you would say such a thing!

4916
03:20:23,230 --> 03:20:23,330
I can't believe you would say such a thing!

4917
03:20:24,850 --> 03:20:25,870
Okay, let's see.

4918
03:20:25,950 --> 03:20:26,270
Whoa!

4919
03:20:28,030 --> 03:20:28,750
Let's see.

4920
03:20:28,850 --> 03:20:29,470
What the fuck I did?

4921
03:20:29,490 --> 03:20:30,030
Why did you hear me?

4922
03:20:30,190 --> 03:20:31,210
It can't be my gun, right?

4923
03:20:35,190 --> 03:20:36,450
No, not this guy.

4924
03:20:37,970 --> 03:20:38,370
Okay.

4925
03:20:39,290 --> 03:20:41,010
I'll make sure he doesn't get close to me.

4926
03:20:41,790 --> 03:20:42,590
Oh, reloading.

4927
03:20:43,930 --> 03:20:45,030
Don't get close to me.

4928
03:20:45,370 --> 03:20:46,610
Don't get close to me.

4929
03:20:46,810 --> 03:20:47,870
Okay, I'm gonna use this.

4930
03:20:48,470 --> 03:20:48,870
Hahaha!

4931
03:20:52,390 --> 03:20:52,790
That...

4932
03:20:52,790 --> 03:20:55,990
That I heard is a one-shot, so I don't wanna risk that.

4933
03:20:57,590 --> 03:20:59,350
I'm not risking the one-shot guy.

4934
03:20:59,530 --> 03:20:59,730
I'm not risking the one-shot guy.

4935
03:21:02,090 --> 03:21:03,090
Oh, he has a helmet.

4936
03:21:03,310 --> 03:21:04,650
I can still shoot you in the face.

4937
03:21:07,390 --> 03:21:07,810
Nice.

4938
03:21:09,410 --> 03:21:09,830
Okay.

4939
03:21:10,710 --> 03:21:12,870
I can tell when you're dead because you...

4940
03:21:12,870 --> 03:21:13,530
I can tell when you're dead because you...

4941
03:21:13,530 --> 03:21:14,010
You fall down.

4942
03:21:15,210 --> 03:21:16,250
And you drop loot.

4943
03:21:19,670 --> 03:21:20,990
Damon, thank you for the super chat!

4944
03:21:21,070 --> 03:21:21,350
Thank you!

4945
03:21:22,370 --> 03:21:24,490
Is there anybody above me before I go up?

4946
03:21:24,590 --> 03:21:24,870
Is there anybody above me before I go up?

4947
03:21:27,390 --> 03:21:28,610
Here's somebody up top.

4948
03:21:29,730 --> 03:21:31,730
I had to say this at least once.

4949
03:21:31,910 --> 03:21:32,530
You're amazing.

4950
03:21:32,730 --> 03:21:33,790
Don't ever change.

4951
03:21:33,910 --> 03:21:35,190
Thank you, I know I'm perfect.

4952
03:21:35,790 --> 03:21:36,890
The Doki way.

4953
03:21:38,910 --> 03:21:41,710
I could sneak up, but then I could do this!

4954
03:21:42,030 --> 03:21:42,270
I could sneak up, but then I could do this!

4955
03:21:42,270 --> 03:21:42,370
Oh!

4956
03:21:44,890 --> 03:21:47,030
The rain covered my running.

4957
03:21:47,570 --> 03:21:47,650
The rain covered my running.

4958
03:21:51,830 --> 03:21:53,170
Raps, thank you for the super chat!

4959
03:21:53,270 --> 03:21:54,070
Thank you, thank you!

4960
03:21:55,070 --> 03:21:56,910
That's what I called a pro gamer.

4961
03:21:57,110 --> 03:21:57,490
Exactly!

4962
03:21:58,510 --> 03:21:59,770
This is how gamers play this game.

4963
03:22:03,030 --> 03:22:03,870
Where are they?

4964
03:22:03,930 --> 03:22:04,470
I hear them.

4965
03:22:08,410 --> 03:22:09,210
Where are they?

4966
03:22:09,330 --> 03:22:10,150
I hear them.

4967
03:22:10,370 --> 03:22:11,190
Oh, there he is.

4968
03:22:12,570 --> 03:22:13,850
Oh shit, crit!

4969
03:22:14,050 --> 03:22:14,530
Nice.

4970
03:22:15,370 --> 03:22:16,070
Good crit.

4971
03:22:18,010 --> 03:22:19,150
There's like one more.

4972
03:22:20,190 --> 03:22:20,670
Somewhere.

4973
03:22:25,010 --> 03:22:25,850
Where is this?

4974
03:22:26,550 --> 03:22:28,710
Holy shit, what the fuck is this map?

4975
03:22:29,230 --> 03:22:29,710
Hahaha!

4976
03:22:31,410 --> 03:22:32,190
What the fuck?

4977
03:22:32,810 --> 03:22:34,170
What the fuck?

4978
03:22:34,330 --> 03:22:35,730
He just stood there!

4979
03:22:35,950 --> 03:22:38,250
What are you doing in this corner?

4980
03:22:39,950 --> 03:22:40,610
Bro!

4981
03:22:40,830 --> 03:22:43,730
It wasn't even like a hiding spot.

4982
03:22:43,930 --> 03:22:45,150
You just stood there.

4983
03:22:46,270 --> 03:22:47,850
He wasn't even hiding.

4984
03:22:47,890 --> 03:22:49,090
That's like the worst part.

4985
03:22:51,410 --> 03:22:52,970
He just stood there.

4986
03:22:53,130 --> 03:22:53,990
Like, honestly.

4987
03:22:55,950 --> 03:22:57,290
What was the point?

4988
03:22:57,510 --> 03:22:58,870
He's just chillin'.

4989
03:22:58,870 --> 03:22:59,390
He's just chillin'.

4990
03:23:01,670 --> 03:23:02,810
Okay, let's see.

4991
03:23:03,230 --> 03:23:05,590
Oh, we can combine it.

4992
03:23:09,170 --> 03:23:10,130
Alright, here we go.

4993
03:23:10,310 --> 03:23:11,330
He's pissing.

4994
03:23:12,430 --> 03:23:15,250
He was trying to use the bathroom.

4995
03:23:15,370 --> 03:23:17,290
Does it look like there's any toilets here?

4996
03:23:17,610 --> 03:23:19,070
But why in the cave?

4997
03:23:19,490 --> 03:23:23,130
Like, help the bushes grow or some shit.

4998
03:23:23,470 --> 03:23:24,570
Like, I don't know.

4999
03:23:25,050 --> 03:23:28,230
Like, why waste the liquid?

5000
03:23:28,970 --> 03:23:30,370
On the rock!

5001
03:23:30,530 --> 03:23:31,730
Let me shoot the legs.

5002
03:23:33,770 --> 03:23:34,770
Wait, what the fuck?

5003
03:23:34,990 --> 03:23:35,910
Shoot the toes?

5004
03:23:41,750 --> 03:23:42,250
Alright.

5005
03:23:42,550 --> 03:23:43,190
Here we go.

5006
03:23:44,890 --> 03:23:46,170
I'll shoot the legs here.

5007
03:23:47,330 --> 03:23:47,930
It's fine.

5008
03:23:48,590 --> 03:23:49,570
Shoot the leg.

5009
03:23:51,690 --> 03:23:52,190
Nice.

5010
03:23:52,890 --> 03:23:53,570
Wait, what?

5011
03:23:53,670 --> 03:23:54,330
Behind me?

5012
03:23:54,530 --> 03:23:55,270
Oh, wait, no.

5013
03:23:55,290 --> 03:23:55,630
It's him.

5014
03:23:56,070 --> 03:23:58,710
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

5015
03:23:58,950 --> 03:23:59,550
Alright, there you go.

5016
03:24:00,070 --> 03:24:00,570
Gotta make sure.

5017
03:24:02,130 --> 03:24:04,070
He's a fan of erosion.

5018
03:24:07,550 --> 03:24:10,050
He's trying to make some diamonds.

5019
03:24:10,130 --> 03:24:10,730
You don't understand.

5020
03:24:12,890 --> 03:24:13,910
A rocket launcher?

5021
03:24:16,930 --> 03:24:18,270
What the fuck?

5022
03:24:21,710 --> 03:24:23,350
Yeah, this is not good at all.

5023
03:24:24,330 --> 03:24:26,090
Wait, where is the rocket launcher guy?

5024
03:24:26,610 --> 03:24:27,430
Oh, there he is.

5025
03:24:28,750 --> 03:24:29,470
Oh, shit.

5026
03:24:29,550 --> 03:24:29,770
Okay.

5027
03:24:30,910 --> 03:24:32,170
We're gonna make sure.

5028
03:24:32,190 --> 03:24:33,690
I'm gonna shoot you in the legs.

5029
03:24:34,530 --> 03:24:35,450
Alright, there you go.

5030
03:24:37,190 --> 03:24:38,270
Alright, kick time.

5031
03:24:38,410 --> 03:24:38,830
Kick time.

5032
03:24:39,210 --> 03:24:39,650
Kick.

5033
03:24:39,750 --> 03:24:41,250
Oh, what the fuck?

5034
03:24:42,350 --> 03:24:43,190
My god.

5035
03:24:44,770 --> 03:24:46,390
You should go into pro wrestling.

5036
03:24:47,210 --> 03:24:47,830
Oh, god.

5037
03:24:47,890 --> 03:24:48,170
Here we go.

5038
03:24:50,150 --> 03:24:51,050
I shank him?

5039
03:24:54,030 --> 03:24:55,030
Oh, he was dead.

5040
03:24:55,110 --> 03:24:55,970
He was dead anyway.

5041
03:24:57,550 --> 03:24:59,730
I can't tell when you're dead!

5042
03:25:00,750 --> 03:25:00,990
Oh!

5043
03:25:01,770 --> 03:25:02,570
Pause, pause, pause!

5044
03:25:03,770 --> 03:25:04,750
Thank you for pausing.

5045
03:25:05,530 --> 03:25:06,210
Hahahaha.

5046
03:25:09,090 --> 03:25:09,770
Hahahaha.

5047
03:25:10,890 --> 03:25:11,570
Hahahaha.

5048
03:25:12,570 --> 03:25:13,630
Alright, nice.

5049
03:25:13,870 --> 03:25:14,770
Thank god he paused.

5050
03:25:18,740 --> 03:25:20,240
Thank you for pausing.

5051
03:25:22,720 --> 03:25:23,400
Hahahaha.

5052
03:25:24,300 --> 03:25:24,440
Hahahaha.

5053
03:25:24,640 --> 03:25:25,320
What?

5054
03:25:25,320 --> 03:25:27,220
I'm practicing for Sniper Elite.

5055
03:25:27,720 --> 03:25:29,380
You know, for the ball shot.

5056
03:25:30,380 --> 03:25:32,100
Guys, you won't understand.

5057
03:25:32,240 --> 03:25:33,400
It's for the ball shot.

5058
03:25:35,620 --> 03:25:36,520
There you go.

5059
03:25:38,200 --> 03:25:38,800
Hahahaha.

5060
03:25:38,860 --> 03:25:40,220
He really paused.

5061
03:25:44,230 --> 03:25:44,830
Nice.

5062
03:25:50,270 --> 03:25:51,470
Alright, here we go.

5063
03:25:52,210 --> 03:25:52,810
Woah.

5064
03:25:53,170 --> 03:25:57,110
Bro, how come you get arrows, but that one guy gets a fucking rocket launcher?

5065
03:25:57,390 --> 03:25:59,410
Jesus Christ, where did you come from?

5066
03:26:00,510 --> 03:26:01,110
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

5067
03:26:01,130 --> 03:26:01,390
Yeah.

5068
03:26:02,070 --> 03:26:03,330
The nesticle shot.

5069
03:26:04,270 --> 03:26:06,070
We have to practice somewhere, chat.

5070
03:26:06,550 --> 03:26:08,930
We need to find time to practice for it.

5071
03:26:09,530 --> 03:26:10,750
This was that time.

5072
03:26:14,730 --> 03:26:15,690
Budget cuts.

5073
03:26:16,030 --> 03:26:17,130
Bro, that poor guy.

5074
03:26:17,550 --> 03:26:18,030
Hahahaha.

5075
03:26:21,580 --> 03:26:22,140
Okay.

5076
03:26:24,180 --> 03:26:25,780
Just want to make sure there's no loot up here.

5077
03:26:27,400 --> 03:26:28,200
Oh, okay.

5078
03:26:28,280 --> 03:26:29,220
And there's... nevermind.

5079
03:26:30,820 --> 03:26:31,380
What?

5080
03:26:31,660 --> 03:26:33,400
Oh my god.

5081
03:26:34,440 --> 03:26:34,620
I didn't even count.

5082
03:26:34,820 --> 03:26:35,140
Nice.

5083
03:26:35,400 --> 03:26:37,240
Oh, not nice.

5084
03:26:39,500 --> 03:26:40,160
It's okay.

5085
03:26:40,380 --> 03:26:42,500
He needs to take time to crawl up.

5086
03:26:44,240 --> 03:26:44,940
We're good.

5087
03:26:45,640 --> 03:26:47,960
It was too much time to walk up.

5088
03:26:51,620 --> 03:26:55,080
Okay, I was going to say, if there's anybody waiting there, because they had to pee.

5089
03:26:56,780 --> 03:26:58,000
Pee in the corner there.

5090
03:26:58,040 --> 03:26:58,420
I was waiting.

5091
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:00,320
Alright, nice.

5092
03:27:01,620 --> 03:27:02,100
Yay.

5093
03:27:02,100 --> 03:27:05,360
Imagine if I had to stealth all of that.

5094
03:27:06,280 --> 03:27:08,300
Would be a waste of my time.

5095
03:27:08,820 --> 03:27:09,540
Hahahaha.

5096
03:27:10,500 --> 03:27:11,220
Hahahaha.

5097
03:27:11,860 --> 03:27:15,040
Would have been a huge waste of time.

5098
03:27:16,060 --> 03:27:17,980
The pee corner, exactly.

5099
03:27:19,800 --> 03:27:20,820
Let's see.

5100
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:22,140
Oh my god.

5101
03:27:22,660 --> 03:27:23,380
What?

5102
03:27:24,260 --> 03:27:27,080
Alright, we gotta do this apparently.

5103
03:27:27,800 --> 03:27:30,540
This is a long area.

5104
03:27:30,900 --> 03:27:31,620
I'm going to go to the other side.

5105
03:27:34,670 --> 03:27:37,130
Okay, that's a rocket launcher, dude.

5106
03:27:39,190 --> 03:27:42,690
I just want to make sure I kill the rocket launcher dude first.

5107
03:27:43,190 --> 03:27:46,090
Because like, all these other guys don't matter at that point.

5108
03:27:47,790 --> 03:27:48,310
Okay.

5109
03:27:48,710 --> 03:27:50,270
These guys don't matter.

5110
03:27:51,290 --> 03:27:53,630
I just have to kill the rocket launcher, man.

5111
03:27:55,230 --> 03:27:56,210
Alright, get over here.

5112
03:27:56,670 --> 03:27:56,990
Oh.

5113
03:27:57,370 --> 03:27:58,130
He shot.

5114
03:28:00,730 --> 03:28:01,890
There you go.

5115
03:28:02,350 --> 03:28:02,870
Nice.

5116
03:28:02,930 --> 03:28:03,430
Nice.

5117
03:28:03,430 --> 03:28:03,830
Nice.

5118
03:28:03,830 --> 03:28:04,310
Nice.

5119
03:28:05,750 --> 03:28:07,410
Alright, are you wearing anything on your helmet?

5120
03:28:07,870 --> 03:28:08,990
No, I can totally shoot that.

5121
03:28:09,070 --> 03:28:09,930
That's a gas mask.

5122
03:28:11,550 --> 03:28:14,970
Gas mask isn't tanky enough to stop a bullet.

5123
03:28:15,310 --> 03:28:16,050
Wait, what the fuck?

5124
03:28:16,070 --> 03:28:16,390
You're alive?

5125
03:28:17,490 --> 03:28:18,050
Oh shit.

5126
03:28:18,150 --> 03:28:18,710
Yeah, he's alive.

5127
03:28:20,110 --> 03:28:20,910
Alright, don't worry.

5128
03:28:20,970 --> 03:28:21,230
We're fine.

5129
03:28:22,270 --> 03:28:23,750
You see those three ammo?

5130
03:28:23,890 --> 03:28:25,650
We're going to grab ammo from that one guy.

5131
03:28:28,410 --> 03:28:29,270
Supposed to go here.

5132
03:28:29,390 --> 03:28:30,490
Okay, there should be loot here.

5133
03:28:33,810 --> 03:28:34,310
It's still there.

5134
03:28:34,330 --> 03:28:34,710
Still ammo.

5135
03:28:36,190 --> 03:28:36,930
Yay!

5136
03:28:37,850 --> 03:28:40,770
Like I never waste a handgun ammo.

5137
03:28:41,130 --> 03:28:42,250
Never punished.

5138
03:28:42,890 --> 03:28:44,970
I love not getting punished.

5139
03:28:47,230 --> 03:28:48,410
Okay, nice.

5140
03:28:48,410 --> 03:28:49,930
There is a...

5141
03:28:49,930 --> 03:28:51,650
Where is it?

5142
03:28:52,390 --> 03:28:53,850
I hear it.

5143
03:28:55,110 --> 03:28:56,650
The fuck is it?

5144
03:28:58,510 --> 03:28:59,250
Huh?

5145
03:29:00,170 --> 03:29:01,350
Where are you?

5146
03:29:02,390 --> 03:29:03,710
I hear you.

5147
03:29:04,370 --> 03:29:05,950
Oh, right here in this corner.

5148
03:29:06,570 --> 03:29:07,090
Okay.

5149
03:29:07,490 --> 03:29:09,050
I don't even know why I shoot these.

5150
03:29:09,090 --> 03:29:09,910
I already missed one.

5151
03:29:10,390 --> 03:29:13,390
I already missed one.

5152
03:29:13,510 --> 03:29:15,310
There's no point in doing these.

5153
03:29:16,650 --> 03:29:17,710
Oh my god.

5154
03:29:22,130 --> 03:29:23,570
I think you're here somewhere.

5155
03:29:24,650 --> 03:29:25,330
Are you?

5156
03:29:25,710 --> 03:29:27,030
Oh no, this door is here.

5157
03:29:27,910 --> 03:29:28,430
Hello.

5158
03:29:31,250 --> 03:29:31,770
Oop.

5159
03:29:34,840 --> 03:29:35,580
Go back.

5160
03:29:35,620 --> 03:29:36,980
Guys, it's in the village.

5161
03:29:37,760 --> 03:29:39,800
I don't think I can go back.

5162
03:29:40,220 --> 03:29:40,740
Guys.

5163
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,780
Guys, that's how far I've missed it.

5164
03:29:43,880 --> 03:29:46,120
It's all the way back in the fucking village.

5165
03:29:46,900 --> 03:29:47,460
It's all the way back in the fucking village.

5166
03:29:49,940 --> 03:29:51,340
Guys, it's gone.

5167
03:29:51,380 --> 03:29:51,560
Guys, it's gone.

5168
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:52,420
It's so over.

5169
03:29:53,520 --> 03:29:55,240
It's so over.

5170
03:29:56,800 --> 03:29:58,420
You have to move on.

5171
03:29:58,500 --> 03:29:59,520
It's gone, God.

5172
03:29:59,880 --> 03:30:00,220
It's gone, God.

5173
03:30:02,140 --> 03:30:03,320
Reset the run.

5174
03:30:03,360 --> 03:30:04,800
It's the only way.

5175
03:30:06,720 --> 03:30:07,780
Where do I go?

5176
03:30:07,860 --> 03:30:08,440
Where do I go from?

5177
03:30:08,880 --> 03:30:10,300
Do I use this door?

5178
03:30:15,750 --> 03:30:17,310
Can I open this door?

5179
03:30:17,390 --> 03:30:17,830
No, right?

5180
03:30:18,190 --> 03:30:18,810
Yeah.

5181
03:30:20,430 --> 03:30:21,650
I hear it.

5182
03:30:25,410 --> 03:30:27,090
Okay, this is safe area.

5183
03:30:29,030 --> 03:30:30,170
Is that a bug?

5184
03:30:31,730 --> 03:30:32,910
Where is that?

5185
03:30:33,750 --> 03:30:35,210
Is that the one outside?

5186
03:30:35,350 --> 03:30:35,970
Is that the one outside?

5187
03:30:37,170 --> 03:30:39,950
I can't tell if it's that the one outside.

5188
03:30:40,310 --> 03:30:41,330
Or upstairs.

5189
03:30:44,370 --> 03:30:46,030
Maybe they can activate this.

5190
03:30:47,830 --> 03:30:48,790
Come on.

5191
03:30:51,750 --> 03:30:52,370
Come on.

5192
03:30:53,910 --> 03:30:54,310
Yeah.

5193
03:30:54,750 --> 03:30:55,650
What the fuck?

5194
03:30:57,070 --> 03:31:01,410
He just walked through that.

5195
03:31:02,750 --> 03:31:03,550
No.

5196
03:31:05,270 --> 03:31:05,670
No.

5197
03:31:07,950 --> 03:31:09,050
What the fuck?

5198
03:31:09,070 --> 03:31:09,950
How is that fair?

5199
03:31:12,470 --> 03:31:14,570
You can just walk through that?

5200
03:31:16,610 --> 03:31:18,230
How did he survive?

5201
03:31:18,890 --> 03:31:19,410
How did he survive?

5202
03:31:19,410 --> 03:31:21,310
How did he survive?

5203
03:31:21,730 --> 03:31:22,290
Bro.

5204
03:31:23,310 --> 03:31:24,350
That's fucked up.

5205
03:31:25,390 --> 03:31:26,330
That's so unfair.

5206
03:31:26,830 --> 03:31:26,990
That's so unfair.

5207
03:31:28,290 --> 03:31:30,690
Who said he just take the...

5208
03:31:30,690 --> 03:31:31,510
He still has...

5209
03:31:31,510 --> 03:31:33,310
The worst part is that he still has his legs.

5210
03:31:33,970 --> 03:31:34,630
Like I...

5211
03:31:34,630 --> 03:31:35,330
Look, look, see?

5212
03:31:35,590 --> 03:31:36,890
Okay, someone's going barefoot.

5213
03:31:37,690 --> 03:31:39,210
He still has his legs.

5214
03:31:40,570 --> 03:31:41,190
He still has his legs.

5215
03:31:42,890 --> 03:31:43,830
Did I miss anything?

5216
03:31:44,090 --> 03:31:44,270
No.

5217
03:31:46,910 --> 03:31:47,390
Boop.

5218
03:31:48,390 --> 03:31:49,690
Oh yeah, I've done the suplex.

5219
03:31:50,570 --> 03:31:51,530
Because def...

5220
03:31:51,530 --> 03:31:53,590
Like those legs are definitely wrestling material.

5221
03:31:57,150 --> 03:31:58,470
Oh wait, the lockers.

5222
03:31:58,530 --> 03:31:59,990
I almost forgot about the lockers.

5223
03:32:01,330 --> 03:32:02,290
Okay, nice.

5224
03:32:03,610 --> 03:32:04,090
Nice.

5225
03:32:04,310 --> 03:32:05,730
Is there any other lockers back here?

5226
03:32:06,790 --> 03:32:07,750
No, it's just those.

5227
03:32:08,010 --> 03:32:08,450
Alright.

5228
03:32:09,810 --> 03:32:11,630
Yeah, those were all the lockers.

5229
03:32:12,170 --> 03:32:13,550
I can't believe it.

5230
03:32:13,550 --> 03:32:14,330
That's so not fair.

5231
03:32:15,110 --> 03:32:16,630
It was so fucking thick.

5232
03:32:18,830 --> 03:32:19,390
Alright.

5233
03:32:19,630 --> 03:32:21,450
Gotta save on my typewriter.

5234
03:32:25,350 --> 03:32:26,130
Here we go.

5235
03:32:27,870 --> 03:32:28,430
Yeah.

5236
03:32:28,550 --> 03:32:29,390
No yellow paint.

5237
03:32:31,970 --> 03:32:36,230
How was I supposed to know if there's loot if there's no yellow paint on the locker?

5238
03:32:36,570 --> 03:32:37,110
Ashley!

5239
03:32:42,110 --> 03:32:42,670
Ashley!

5240
03:32:43,710 --> 03:32:43,850
Oh shit!

5241
03:32:44,990 --> 03:32:46,050
Just wake up!

5242
03:32:46,070 --> 03:32:46,710
Are you stupid?

5243
03:32:46,950 --> 03:32:48,170
Why don't you just wake up?

5244
03:32:50,010 --> 03:32:50,750
Rescue Ashley.

5245
03:32:52,450 --> 03:32:53,390
Where are the thing?

5246
03:32:54,670 --> 03:32:55,110
Oh

5247
03:32:58,400 --> 03:32:58,780
my god.

5248
03:32:58,820 --> 03:32:59,500
He doesn't see me.

5249
03:32:59,620 --> 03:32:59,980
It's fine.

5250
03:33:00,760 --> 03:33:01,440
It's fine.

5251
03:33:02,540 --> 03:33:03,220
It's fine.

5252
03:33:03,240 --> 03:33:05,380
I'll just kill him before he comes over.

5253
03:33:07,380 --> 03:33:08,060
It's fine.

5254
03:33:08,640 --> 03:33:09,320
Oh shit!

5255
03:33:09,320 --> 03:33:10,000
Oh this is not fine!

5256
03:33:11,540 --> 03:33:12,420
Oh my god!

5257
03:33:12,440 --> 03:33:13,200
This is not fine!

5258
03:33:13,360 --> 03:33:13,840
It's okay!

5259
03:33:14,900 --> 03:33:15,540
It's okay.

5260
03:33:16,120 --> 03:33:16,560
Yes!

5261
03:33:16,660 --> 03:33:16,900
Okay!

5262
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:17,320
It's fine.

5263
03:33:18,540 --> 03:33:19,120
See?

5264
03:33:19,320 --> 03:33:19,820
It's fine.

5265
03:33:19,940 --> 03:33:20,600
Who needs stealth?

5266
03:33:21,720 --> 03:33:23,100
Who needs stealth?

5267
03:33:25,440 --> 03:33:26,020
Gun.

5268
03:33:26,840 --> 03:33:28,060
Gun is my stealth.

5269
03:33:30,880 --> 03:33:36,700
I like how after I used my rifle ammo, someone was like save your rifle ammo.

5270
03:33:41,740 --> 03:33:42,660
Thank you.

5271
03:33:46,040 --> 03:33:47,760
Every fucking time.

5272
03:33:49,980 --> 03:33:50,500
Doki!

5273
03:33:50,700 --> 03:33:53,880
This is the right time to save your rifle ammo, Doki!

5274
03:33:55,180 --> 03:33:58,360
I say as I fucking shot four fucking bullets.

5275
03:34:03,610 --> 03:34:04,650
I say as I fucking shot four fucking bullets.

5276
03:34:04,650 --> 03:34:05,030
God damn it.

5277
03:34:05,070 --> 03:34:06,010
I don't have Ashley for this.

5278
03:34:06,270 --> 03:34:06,430
God damn it.

5279
03:34:06,430 --> 03:34:06,430
I don't have Ashley for this.

5280
03:34:06,430 --> 03:34:08,070
Why can't I just shoot the fucking thing?

5281
03:34:08,970 --> 03:34:10,090
Ashley, get up!

5282
03:34:13,690 --> 03:34:14,210
Okay.

5283
03:34:14,770 --> 03:34:14,830
Okay.

5284
03:34:15,910 --> 03:34:17,370
Where the fuck do I go?

5285
03:34:17,890 --> 03:34:17,930
Where the fuck do I go?

5286
03:34:19,330 --> 03:34:20,530
Oh there's a ladder here.

5287
03:34:20,750 --> 03:34:21,370
Oh my gosh.

5288
03:34:21,550 --> 03:34:22,290
God damn it.

5289
03:34:22,290 --> 03:34:24,050
The yellow paint has to be more yellow.

5290
03:34:27,770 --> 03:34:31,170
Why couldn't they make the yellow paint more yellow?

5291
03:34:34,310 --> 03:34:34,810
Alright.

5292
03:34:34,970 --> 03:34:35,630
Don't worry.

5293
03:34:35,710 --> 03:34:36,950
I have my rifle right here.

5294
03:34:38,810 --> 03:34:39,310
Alright.

5295
03:34:39,370 --> 03:34:39,970
Let's see.

5296
03:34:40,750 --> 03:34:43,390
I'm gonna put this together just in case.

5297
03:34:44,230 --> 03:34:44,730
Alright.

5298
03:34:44,810 --> 03:34:45,370
Here we go.

5299
03:34:45,970 --> 03:34:47,190
I have my rifle!

5300
03:34:47,190 --> 03:34:47,270
I have my rifle!

5301
03:34:50,230 --> 03:34:50,710
Okay.

5302
03:34:50,730 --> 03:34:51,830
Let's kill this guy first.

5303
03:34:51,910 --> 03:34:52,170
Nice.

5304
03:34:52,210 --> 03:34:52,450
Crit.

5305
03:34:52,890 --> 03:34:53,370
Nice.

5306
03:34:53,410 --> 03:34:53,610
Crit.

5307
03:34:57,190 --> 03:34:57,670
Alright.

5308
03:34:59,710 --> 03:35:00,190
Goodbye.

5309
03:35:01,690 --> 03:35:02,170
Boop!

5310
03:35:05,280 --> 03:35:06,160
Anything else?

5311
03:35:06,380 --> 03:35:07,360
Anybody else here?

5312
03:35:08,740 --> 03:35:09,760
I hear you!

5313
03:35:11,800 --> 03:35:12,360
Come on.

5314
03:35:12,400 --> 03:35:12,820
Get closer.

5315
03:35:12,980 --> 03:35:14,200
I can't shoot you in the legs.

5316
03:35:15,500 --> 03:35:17,320
I can't shoot you in the kneecaps.

5317
03:35:17,640 --> 03:35:18,520
Or the balls.

5318
03:35:19,540 --> 03:35:19,980
Nice.

5319
03:35:20,020 --> 03:35:20,300
Okay.

5320
03:35:20,940 --> 03:35:21,540
Get over here.

5321
03:35:21,760 --> 03:35:22,200
Boom!

5322
03:35:23,380 --> 03:35:24,640
Shot you in the nuts too.

5323
03:35:24,740 --> 03:35:25,420
Just in case.

5324
03:35:25,920 --> 03:35:27,360
Now you'll never have kids.

5325
03:35:28,720 --> 03:35:29,160
Nice.

5326
03:35:32,240 --> 03:35:36,960
Honestly, I'm pretty sure you can't have kids because of the whole larvae parasite thing in you.

5327
03:35:38,880 --> 03:35:41,180
I don't think you're able to produce children.

5328
03:35:42,900 --> 03:35:44,980
Even if I didn't shoot you in the balls.

5329
03:35:45,880 --> 03:35:46,340
Let's see.

5330
03:35:46,480 --> 03:35:46,840
This way.

5331
03:35:48,620 --> 03:35:49,580
Is there any loot?

5332
03:35:50,280 --> 03:35:50,760
Loot!

5333
03:35:53,700 --> 03:35:54,180
Money!

5334
03:35:55,380 --> 03:35:55,860
Ammo!

5335
03:35:56,060 --> 03:35:56,960
I missed ammo?

5336
03:35:57,080 --> 03:35:57,460
Oh, I did!

5337
03:35:57,980 --> 03:35:58,440
Fuck.

5338
03:35:59,800 --> 03:36:00,700
Let me go back.

5339
03:36:02,360 --> 03:36:03,140
It's right here.

5340
03:36:03,280 --> 03:36:04,440
It's the thing that was glowing.

5341
03:36:07,920 --> 03:36:09,780
I missed the glowing thing.

5342
03:36:09,840 --> 03:36:10,460
How could I?

5343
03:36:11,660 --> 03:36:13,140
It was literally glowing.

5344
03:36:14,540 --> 03:36:16,520
You always surprise me, Doki.

5345
03:36:19,580 --> 03:36:21,680
I don't like this.

5346
03:36:22,120 --> 03:36:24,120
I do not like this kitchen.

5347
03:36:27,180 --> 03:36:27,920
Locker.

5348
03:36:28,180 --> 03:36:28,920
Okay.

5349
03:36:28,920 --> 03:36:29,720
Shotgun ammo.

5350
03:36:30,140 --> 03:36:31,960
I sort of need...

5351
03:36:32,490 --> 03:36:35,820
I sort of need rifle ammo because I wasted it.

5352
03:36:36,700 --> 03:36:37,340
Woo!

5353
03:36:39,180 --> 03:36:39,920
Hello?

5354
03:36:42,900 --> 03:36:43,640
Hello?

5355
03:36:43,760 --> 03:36:45,180
Anybody in the P-corner?

5356
03:36:47,460 --> 03:36:49,160
Lord Crows says thank you for the super chat.

5357
03:36:49,240 --> 03:36:49,480
Thank you.

5358
03:36:49,540 --> 03:36:49,940
Thank you.

5359
03:36:50,440 --> 03:36:50,780
Reminder.

5360
03:36:51,700 --> 03:36:53,400
Adoption is always an option.

5361
03:36:54,100 --> 03:36:55,200
Thank you for the super chat.

5362
03:36:55,280 --> 03:36:55,580
Thank you.

5363
03:36:55,620 --> 03:36:56,120
Thank you.

5364
03:36:57,520 --> 03:36:58,100
The fuck?

5365
03:36:58,180 --> 03:36:59,320
Why is there like...

5366
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:00,960
I don't like this.

5367
03:37:01,020 --> 03:37:03,380
I don't like how there was like a corridor for no reason.

5368
03:37:03,520 --> 03:37:04,860
Because that means there is a reason.

5369
03:37:11,500 --> 03:37:11,840
Hello?

5370
03:37:14,140 --> 03:37:14,640
Oh, hey.

5371
03:37:14,720 --> 03:37:15,040
Money.

5372
03:37:17,900 --> 03:37:19,320
I don't like that.

5373
03:37:19,420 --> 03:37:23,280
I don't like that.

5374
03:37:24,860 --> 03:37:25,940
Just in case.

5375
03:37:26,600 --> 03:37:27,920
Don't even drop loot?

5376
03:37:28,300 --> 03:37:29,360
What the fuck?

5377
03:37:30,000 --> 03:37:30,560
Bro!

5378
03:37:35,010 --> 03:37:35,850
Oh, merchant.

5379
03:37:36,450 --> 03:37:37,270
I'm safe.

5380
03:37:37,490 --> 03:37:37,950
Why not?

5381
03:37:38,070 --> 03:37:38,530
Welcome.

5382
03:37:39,010 --> 03:37:39,810
I'm safe.

5383
03:37:41,030 --> 03:37:42,710
Oh, is there anything I can sell?

5384
03:37:43,050 --> 03:37:43,850
Okay, sell.

5385
03:37:45,070 --> 03:37:45,630
Sell.

5386
03:37:46,190 --> 03:37:47,190
Okay, do I have it locked?

5387
03:37:48,750 --> 03:37:50,190
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

5388
03:37:50,350 --> 03:37:50,850
Oh, I do.

5389
03:37:50,970 --> 03:37:51,490
Fuck yeah.

5390
03:37:51,590 --> 03:37:51,850
Okay.

5391
03:37:52,410 --> 03:37:55,390
I'm gonna make this stuff first before I sell.

5392
03:37:56,250 --> 03:37:57,730
Oh, I got another crown.

5393
03:37:57,870 --> 03:37:58,490
I didn't even notice.

5394
03:38:00,010 --> 03:38:00,450
Alright.

5395
03:38:00,510 --> 03:38:00,870
One.

5396
03:38:03,310 --> 03:38:03,750
Two.

5397
03:38:05,510 --> 03:38:05,950
Three.

5398
03:38:06,250 --> 03:38:06,690
Okay.

5399
03:38:08,070 --> 03:38:08,510
One.

5400
03:38:08,510 --> 03:38:08,950
Two.

5401
03:38:09,610 --> 03:38:10,050
Nice.

5402
03:38:10,130 --> 03:38:10,990
Another 100k.

5403
03:38:11,230 --> 03:38:11,670
Easy.

5404
03:38:13,470 --> 03:38:15,190
Oh, I can make another one.

5405
03:38:15,330 --> 03:38:15,770
Nice.

5406
03:38:16,470 --> 03:38:17,250
Yeah, there was no money.

5407
03:38:17,270 --> 03:38:19,110
No way I was gonna find four of a kind.

5408
03:38:19,230 --> 03:38:21,490
Like, three of a kind of the same color.

5409
03:38:22,890 --> 03:38:23,390
Alright.

5410
03:38:24,190 --> 03:38:25,750
Easy 100k.

5411
03:38:26,950 --> 03:38:27,690
Boop, boop.

5412
03:38:28,010 --> 03:38:29,770
Okay, that is...

5413
03:38:29,770 --> 03:38:31,950
Oh, that's a lot of money.

5414
03:38:33,290 --> 03:38:35,910
Uh, I might as well just upgrade my knife.

5415
03:38:36,190 --> 03:38:36,690
Repair.

5416
03:38:38,010 --> 03:38:39,410
And then...

5417
03:38:40,150 --> 03:38:40,650
Wait.

5418
03:38:40,750 --> 03:38:41,610
Is it worth it?

5419
03:38:42,770 --> 03:38:43,270
Nah.

5420
03:38:44,810 --> 03:38:45,310
Nah.

5421
03:38:49,770 --> 03:38:52,110
I'm gonna upgrade my magnum.

5422
03:38:52,690 --> 03:38:53,250
I'm gonna upgrade my magnum.

5423
03:38:53,890 --> 03:38:54,450
I'm gonna upgrade my magnum.

5424
03:38:54,450 --> 03:38:54,770
I already did.

5425
03:38:54,910 --> 03:38:55,470
I maxed out.

5426
03:38:55,770 --> 03:38:57,350
Okay, technically it's maxed out.

5427
03:38:57,390 --> 03:38:58,350
Because I have the upgrade.

5428
03:38:59,070 --> 03:39:00,950
I'm gonna do the...

5429
03:39:00,950 --> 03:39:02,810
I'm gonna do the fucking...

5430
03:39:02,810 --> 03:39:04,470
My magnum.

5431
03:39:04,570 --> 03:39:06,690
I feel like that's much more worth it.

5432
03:39:07,450 --> 03:39:08,230
Let's see.

5433
03:39:08,550 --> 03:39:09,270
Oh, wait.

5434
03:39:09,310 --> 03:39:11,010
We're gonna have the rifle fight, right?

5435
03:39:11,110 --> 03:39:11,530
Okay.

5436
03:39:11,730 --> 03:39:12,270
Uh...

5437
03:39:12,270 --> 03:39:13,310
Reload speed.

5438
03:39:14,210 --> 03:39:14,770
Ammo.

5439
03:39:15,210 --> 03:39:16,330
Rate of fire.

5440
03:39:17,530 --> 03:39:18,010
Uh...

5441
03:39:20,490 --> 03:39:21,450
Let's see.

5442
03:39:22,250 --> 03:39:22,730
Uh...

5443
03:39:22,730 --> 03:39:23,550
I guess...

5444
03:39:24,210 --> 03:39:26,870
Maybe like more reload, I feel like.

5445
03:39:27,110 --> 03:39:27,790
Reload speed.

5446
03:39:30,430 --> 03:39:31,390
I'll do...

5447
03:39:32,150 --> 03:39:33,070
Rate of fire.

5448
03:39:33,170 --> 03:39:34,110
Yeah, I'll do rate of fire.

5449
03:39:34,310 --> 03:39:35,590
And then I'll max out.

5450
03:39:35,750 --> 03:39:36,910
Actually, I can max it out.

5451
03:39:36,990 --> 03:39:38,410
I have enough money to max this out.

5452
03:39:38,890 --> 03:39:39,370
Yay!

5453
03:39:42,130 --> 03:39:42,610
Alright.

5454
03:39:44,130 --> 03:39:46,010
Alright, my rifle is beefed up.

5455
03:39:47,270 --> 03:39:49,510
My fucking rifle is so fucking beefed up now.

5456
03:39:49,690 --> 03:39:50,350
My fucking rifle is so fucking beefed up now.

5457
03:39:50,490 --> 03:39:51,290
Let's see.

5458
03:39:52,670 --> 03:39:53,370
Don't worry.

5459
03:39:54,250 --> 03:39:55,750
This is a tanky rifle.

5460
03:39:56,710 --> 03:39:59,170
I can even craft more rifle ammo.

5461
03:39:59,250 --> 03:40:00,090
Just in case.

5462
03:40:01,770 --> 03:40:03,290
Just in case!

5463
03:40:03,770 --> 03:40:04,210
Just in case!

5464
03:40:06,070 --> 03:40:07,410
And then I save...

5465
03:40:07,410 --> 03:40:07,690
Wait, what?

5466
03:40:08,130 --> 03:40:08,690
Chicken!

5467
03:40:09,010 --> 03:40:09,450
Wait!

5468
03:40:09,630 --> 03:40:10,770
There's a chicken here?

5469
03:40:11,170 --> 03:40:12,850
This is not a good place for a chicken.

5470
03:40:13,450 --> 03:40:14,210
It's not.

5471
03:40:15,770 --> 03:40:16,690
93 saves.

5472
03:40:17,150 --> 03:40:18,110
Here we go.

5473
03:40:21,130 --> 03:40:21,590
Alright.

5474
03:40:22,570 --> 03:40:23,570
Wait, I hear it!

5475
03:40:24,450 --> 03:40:25,630
I hear the chicken!

5476
03:40:27,190 --> 03:40:27,970
Oh my god!

5477
03:40:28,010 --> 03:40:28,690
There she is!

5478
03:40:29,050 --> 03:40:31,150
Where were you chicken when I needed you?

5479
03:40:35,430 --> 03:40:36,890
I don't like this.

5480
03:40:39,130 --> 03:40:40,150
Alright, here we go.

5481
03:40:40,310 --> 03:40:41,450
Wait, I don't have the key for this.

5482
03:40:42,010 --> 03:40:42,470
Still.

5483
03:40:42,710 --> 03:40:43,670
I'll have to go this way.

5484
03:40:44,790 --> 03:40:45,310
Alright.

5485
03:40:46,370 --> 03:40:48,290
Alright, why do I need the rifle?

5486
03:40:48,370 --> 03:40:49,850
We're gonna find out soon!

5487
03:40:51,330 --> 03:40:53,250
I assume we find out here.

5488
03:40:54,170 --> 03:40:54,330
I assume we find out here.

5489
03:40:55,610 --> 03:40:56,130
What?

5490
03:40:56,230 --> 03:40:56,790
Where do I go?

5491
03:40:57,110 --> 03:40:57,630
Freezer?

5492
03:40:58,530 --> 03:40:59,770
I'm gonna go to the freezer.

5493
03:41:00,590 --> 03:41:01,770
I'm gonna go to the freezer.

5494
03:41:04,790 --> 03:41:05,770
God damn it.

5495
03:41:05,810 --> 03:41:07,050
I need cars for everything.

5496
03:41:13,930 --> 03:41:14,450
What?

5497
03:41:18,630 --> 03:41:19,150
What?

5498
03:41:26,670 --> 03:41:27,310
What was that?

5499
03:41:27,510 --> 03:41:31,190
What was that?

5500
03:41:31,430 --> 03:41:36,890
Guys, what was that?

5501
03:41:37,570 --> 03:41:39,890
What was that?

5502
03:41:40,730 --> 03:41:42,010
What was that?

5503
03:41:42,030 --> 03:41:42,250
What was that, guys?

5504
03:41:43,130 --> 03:41:44,210
What was that?

5505
03:41:44,650 --> 03:41:45,950
What was that?

5506
03:41:49,850 --> 03:41:53,190
Guys, what are those things over there?

5507
03:41:53,590 --> 03:41:55,570
why was he crying?

5508
03:41:55,570 --> 03:41:55,750
Are you crying?

5509
03:41:57,530 --> 03:41:59,610
I'm gonna use the bathroom of your bag.

5510
03:43:13,470 --> 03:43:16,090
Why is it in the dark?

5511
03:43:17,650 --> 03:43:18,210
Why?

5512
03:43:26,260 --> 03:43:27,480
Oh my god.

5513
03:43:27,980 --> 03:43:28,540
Why?

5514
03:43:30,740 --> 03:43:31,300
Wait.

5515
03:43:32,200 --> 03:43:33,000
That's a...

5516
03:43:35,040 --> 03:43:35,920
Oh no.

5517
03:43:36,920 --> 03:43:37,760
Guys.

5518
03:43:37,840 --> 03:43:38,660
Oh thank god.

5519
03:43:38,720 --> 03:43:42,020
I accidentally broke my mask.

5520
03:43:46,840 --> 03:43:51,100
Why is it in dark?

5521
03:44:01,240 --> 03:44:02,080
My

5522
03:44:10,940 --> 03:44:11,780
god.

5523
03:44:12,800 --> 03:44:14,280
My god.

5524
03:44:16,540 --> 03:44:17,780
My god!

5525
03:44:26,570 --> 03:44:27,770
I hate this.

5526
03:44:28,920 --> 03:44:29,270
Okay.

5527
03:44:29,570 --> 03:44:36,150
Your keycard application has been approved by the head of the department.

5528
03:44:37,020 --> 03:44:42,670
Please bring your level 1 keycard to dissection and follow the procedure on the next page.

5529
03:44:43,270 --> 03:44:47,250
Overwrite card for level 2 clearance using the machine located in freezer.

5530
03:44:47,690 --> 03:44:52,190
Overwrite card for level 3 clearance using the machine located in incubation lab.

5531
03:44:52,370 --> 03:44:56,610
Please ask each section supervisor for permission to access the machines.

5532
03:44:56,950 --> 03:44:58,550
Permission to access the machines.

5533
03:45:00,550 --> 03:45:02,950
I didn't even finish reading the lore.

5534
03:45:03,090 --> 03:45:03,950
I was so scared.

5535
03:45:04,390 --> 03:45:05,470
Oh wait I did.

5536
03:45:06,510 --> 03:45:08,050
Oh my god!

5537
03:45:23,180 --> 03:45:24,260
What did I open?

5538
03:45:26,360 --> 03:45:28,580
I don't even know what I opened.

5539
03:45:28,680 --> 03:45:29,280
I'm too scared.

5540
03:45:29,700 --> 03:45:30,100
I...

5541
03:45:49,620 --> 03:45:50,960
I can't man.

5542
03:45:51,220 --> 03:45:52,620
I can't.

5543
03:45:59,580 --> 03:46:01,980
I can't!

5544
03:46:03,220 --> 03:46:03,560
I...

5545
03:46:23,520 --> 03:46:26,640
Where do I go?

5546
03:46:35,420 --> 03:46:37,480
I hate this.

5547
03:46:41,350 --> 03:46:43,310
I hate this so much.

5548
03:46:43,590 --> 03:46:46,390
I hate this so fucking much.

5549
03:46:46,690 --> 03:46:47,890
I hate this.

5550
03:46:48,130 --> 03:46:49,950
I don't even have the key card!

5551
03:46:50,130 --> 03:46:50,650
What do I...

5552
03:46:50,650 --> 03:46:52,650
Oh my god bro, I'm stressed out.

5553
03:46:53,350 --> 03:47:02,110
I'm so stressed out.

5554
03:47:04,410 --> 03:47:05,450
Where do I go?

5555
03:47:05,510 --> 03:47:06,050
Do I go here?

5556
03:47:06,690 --> 03:47:07,610
Is it here?

5557
03:47:09,010 --> 03:47:10,650
Oh my god.

5558
03:47:16,950 --> 03:47:17,610
Dissection?

5559
03:47:17,650 --> 03:47:19,390
Where is dissection?

5560
03:47:22,790 --> 03:47:24,150
Oh my god.

5561
03:47:24,150 --> 03:47:24,370
There?

5562
03:47:24,550 --> 03:47:24,770
Okay.

5563
03:47:26,130 --> 03:47:27,870
Oh my god.

5564
03:47:27,930 --> 03:47:28,790
I hate this.

5565
03:47:28,910 --> 03:47:29,670
I hate this.

5566
03:47:29,750 --> 03:47:31,750
I hate this so fucking much.

5567
03:47:34,930 --> 03:47:36,850
Oh my god.

5568
03:47:40,850 --> 03:47:41,510
What?

5569
03:47:43,690 --> 03:47:44,170
Oh!

5570
03:47:44,470 --> 03:47:44,950
Oh!

5571
03:47:45,070 --> 03:47:46,590
Oh my god, please.

5572
03:47:48,010 --> 03:47:48,490
Okay.

5573
03:47:52,680 --> 03:47:53,740
Where does it need to go?

5574
03:47:54,740 --> 03:47:55,520
Oh, there.

5575
03:47:56,640 --> 03:47:57,120
Okay.

5576
03:48:08,650 --> 03:48:09,770
I'm so confused.

5577
03:48:15,660 --> 03:48:16,460
Oh, okay.

5578
03:48:19,880 --> 03:48:21,820
Okay, I can figure this out guys.

5579
03:48:27,290 --> 03:48:28,130
I did it.

5580
03:48:29,490 --> 03:48:30,330
I did it guys.

5581
03:48:40,430 --> 03:48:42,430
What the fuck is that?

5582
03:48:42,910 --> 03:48:43,290
What the fuck is that?

5583
03:48:43,290 --> 03:48:44,870
What kind of experiments are they doing here?

5584
03:48:45,250 --> 03:48:47,190
What the fuck was that?

5585
03:48:51,050 --> 03:48:53,790
At last, I've created a new life.

5586
03:48:55,850 --> 03:48:57,870
I call it regenerator.

5587
03:48:58,150 --> 03:49:00,670
This metabolic capacity is incredible.

5588
03:49:00,970 --> 03:49:04,770
Unless all the parasites residing within it are destroyed, the tissue can...

5589
03:49:04,770 --> 03:49:05,450
Wait!

5590
03:49:05,650 --> 03:49:06,690
Can it never die?

5591
03:49:12,290 --> 03:49:13,830
They never die?

5592
03:49:15,110 --> 03:49:16,630
I can't kill it?

5593
03:49:21,240 --> 03:49:22,000
Okay.

5594
03:49:22,060 --> 03:49:23,740
Upon examining the body...

5595
03:49:25,420 --> 03:49:26,180
With...

5596
03:49:26,180 --> 03:49:28,300
A biosensor...

5597
03:49:33,910 --> 03:49:40,510
They confirmed that the parasites behave like vital organs for the host, almost as though it has multiple harms.

5598
03:49:42,030 --> 03:49:45,690
The new creation mind is essentially immortal.

5599
03:49:46,010 --> 03:49:49,150
Surely even Dr. Frankenstein is...

5600
03:49:49,150 --> 03:49:51,990
He himself would want to shake my hand in admiration.

5601
03:49:55,670 --> 03:49:57,970
I'll be fine if there were lights.

5602
03:49:58,070 --> 03:49:59,890
There's no lights.

5603
03:50:10,450 --> 03:50:14,290
The new creation of mine is essentially...

5604
03:50:14,290 --> 03:50:18,990
These guys made me put down the game for three days in Yoji while I was playing in the dark.

5605
03:50:18,990 --> 03:50:20,690
Thank you for the superchat cast!

5606
03:50:20,890 --> 03:50:21,250
Thank you!

5607
03:50:48,990 --> 03:50:51,470
I'm so full of everything under control.

5608
03:50:57,490 --> 03:51:01,850
The subject went wild and escaped from its cryogenic tank.

5609
03:51:02,090 --> 03:51:03,370
I was a real fool.

5610
03:51:03,890 --> 03:51:05,710
Guys, where's the scope?

5611
03:51:06,770 --> 03:51:08,730
Guys, where's the scope?

5612
03:51:09,410 --> 03:51:10,130
Guys...

5613
03:51:10,990 --> 03:51:13,310
Where the fuck is the scope?

5614
03:51:13,630 --> 03:51:14,350
Guys...

5615
03:51:15,570 --> 03:51:16,910
Where's the scope?

5616
03:51:17,390 --> 03:51:18,110
Guys...

5617
03:51:18,990 --> 03:51:20,390
Where's the scope?

5618
03:51:26,740 --> 03:51:28,400
Leave me alone!

5619
03:51:33,600 --> 03:51:35,760
Oh my god!

5620
03:51:35,940 --> 03:51:36,220
Okay!

5621
03:51:36,420 --> 03:51:37,120
Okay.

5622
03:51:37,400 --> 03:51:38,240
Okay.

5623
03:51:39,120 --> 03:51:39,960
Guys...

5624
03:51:40,380 --> 03:51:41,480
Where's the scope?

5625
03:51:41,720 --> 03:51:43,800
Where is the scope?

5626
03:51:44,580 --> 03:51:46,920
Where is the scope?

5627
03:51:49,380 --> 03:51:51,300
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

5628
03:52:00,390 --> 03:52:01,610
Where's the power?

5629
03:52:01,630 --> 03:52:03,510
Where's the power?

5630
03:52:12,270 --> 03:52:12,950
Guys...

5631
03:52:12,950 --> 03:52:14,770
Guys, where's the power?

5632
03:52:14,850 --> 03:52:16,310
Where do I go?

5633
03:52:16,950 --> 03:52:17,290
Here?

5634
03:52:20,810 --> 03:52:22,410
Do I go here?

5635
03:52:27,570 --> 03:52:28,870
Is it this?

5636
03:52:29,270 --> 03:52:29,930
Okay.

5637
03:52:30,190 --> 03:52:34,890
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

5638
03:52:35,370 --> 03:52:36,050
Boom.

5639
03:52:41,250 --> 03:52:41,730
Boom.

5640
03:52:45,530 --> 03:52:45,810
Boom.

5641
03:52:46,210 --> 03:52:46,430
Boom.

5642
03:52:47,570 --> 03:52:47,690
Boom.

5643
03:52:50,950 --> 03:52:50,970
Boom.

5644
03:52:52,210 --> 03:52:52,690
Boom.

5645
03:52:53,210 --> 03:52:53,690
Boom.

5646
03:52:54,310 --> 03:52:54,450
Boom.

5647
03:52:56,330 --> 03:52:56,810
Boom.

5648
03:52:57,050 --> 03:52:57,290
Boom.

5649
03:52:57,310 --> 03:52:57,330
Boom.

5650
03:52:57,350 --> 03:52:57,370
Boom.

5651
03:52:57,390 --> 03:52:57,410
Boom.

5652
03:52:57,430 --> 03:52:57,450
Boom.

5653
03:52:57,470 --> 03:52:57,490
Boom.

5654
03:52:57,510 --> 03:52:57,530
Boom.

5655
03:52:58,770 --> 03:52:59,250
Boom.

5656
03:53:00,090 --> 03:53:00,570
Boom.

5657
03:53:08,150 --> 03:53:08,630
Boom.

5658
03:53:08,630 --> 03:53:09,150
He's here, right?

5659
03:53:11,250 --> 03:53:13,430
Surely he's not going to...

5660
03:53:15,390 --> 03:53:16,190
Insufficient power?

5661
03:53:16,590 --> 03:53:17,290
What do you mean?

5662
03:53:18,410 --> 03:53:20,710
Guys, he won't attack me, right?

5663
03:53:20,730 --> 03:53:21,130
Guys?

5664
03:53:25,810 --> 03:53:26,850
Surely, right?

5665
03:53:27,010 --> 03:53:28,290
If I just...

5666
03:53:28,290 --> 03:53:29,610
Nah,

5667
03:53:34,370 --> 03:53:37,550
he won't attack me while I'm doing this.

5668
03:53:39,010 --> 03:53:40,450
There's no way.

5669
03:53:41,110 --> 03:53:44,830
There's no way he would attack me while I'm doing this.

5670
03:53:46,850 --> 03:53:48,190
Oh my god.

5671
03:53:50,550 --> 03:53:51,750
No way.

5672
03:53:51,890 --> 03:53:52,950
There's no way.

5673
03:53:56,270 --> 03:53:58,130
Oh god, please.

5674
03:53:58,810 --> 03:54:01,350
Where is the power for this?

5675
03:54:04,270 --> 03:54:06,430
He's just waiting patiently, thank god.

5676
03:54:08,090 --> 03:54:09,330
Please keep waiting.

5677
03:54:19,710 --> 03:54:21,410
Oh my god, is that the scope?

5678
03:54:21,450 --> 03:54:22,570
That's not even the scope!

5679
03:54:22,750 --> 03:54:23,710
I don't need this!

5680
03:54:28,470 --> 03:54:30,530
I don't need this.

5681
03:54:30,610 --> 03:54:32,590
I need the fucking scope!

5682
03:54:33,730 --> 03:54:34,270
Okay.

5683
03:54:34,970 --> 03:54:35,750
We're fine.

5684
03:54:35,930 --> 03:54:37,510
We are so fucking fine.

5685
03:54:37,850 --> 03:54:40,870
We are so fucking fine.

5686
03:54:46,090 --> 03:54:47,410
Oh god.

5687
03:54:51,490 --> 03:54:52,950
Oh god.

5688
03:54:53,370 --> 03:54:54,930
Oh god.

5689
03:54:55,070 --> 03:54:55,250
Oh god.

5690
03:54:55,720 --> 03:54:56,630
What's in here?

5691
03:54:57,670 --> 03:55:00,950
Is there only one of him or is there multiple?

5692
03:55:06,010 --> 03:55:06,910
Oh...

5693
03:55:11,650 --> 03:55:13,450
There's multiple?!

5694
03:55:15,090 --> 03:55:17,310
Now there's two?!

5695
03:55:17,310 --> 03:55:18,670
Oh fuck!

5696
03:55:22,610 --> 03:55:23,190
No!

5697
03:55:24,250 --> 03:55:24,710
No!

5698
03:55:24,710 --> 03:55:24,850
No!

5699
03:55:28,510 --> 03:55:29,090
Okay.

5700
03:55:29,530 --> 03:55:30,110
Okay.

5701
03:55:30,370 --> 03:55:31,210
We're fine.

5702
03:55:31,490 --> 03:55:31,990
Okay.

5703
03:55:34,250 --> 03:55:34,830
Okay.

5704
03:55:35,650 --> 03:55:37,110
Level 2 keycard.

5705
03:55:37,210 --> 03:55:38,510
Do I need to flip the switch?

5706
03:55:39,030 --> 03:55:39,610
Guys?

5707
03:55:40,090 --> 03:55:42,110
Do I need to flip the switch?

5708
03:55:42,210 --> 03:55:42,790
Guys?

5709
03:55:46,630 --> 03:55:48,210
Oh my god.

5710
03:55:53,010 --> 03:55:55,010
I forgot the card!

5711
03:55:56,470 --> 03:55:57,410
Hey, I'm back.

5712
03:56:03,010 --> 03:56:04,170
I got the card!

5713
03:56:04,270 --> 03:56:05,030
I got the card!

5714
03:56:05,070 --> 03:56:05,650
You guys lied!

5715
03:56:05,890 --> 03:56:07,050
You guys lied!

5716
03:56:16,450 --> 03:56:17,650
It's not done!

5717
03:56:17,950 --> 03:56:20,010
It's not done!

5718
03:56:20,010 --> 03:56:20,490
It's not done!

5719
03:56:21,770 --> 03:56:25,770
It's pro- What the fuck is this bullshit?!

5720
03:56:26,390 --> 03:56:28,190
It doesn't matter.

5721
03:56:28,930 --> 03:56:30,130
Give me my card.

5722
03:56:30,850 --> 03:56:32,170
Oh my god.

5723
03:56:32,210 --> 03:56:33,150
Give me the card.

5724
03:56:33,650 --> 03:56:35,090
Give me the card.

5725
03:56:37,030 --> 03:56:37,630
Okay.

5726
03:56:37,710 --> 03:56:39,230
Do I need to reset the power?

5727
03:56:39,530 --> 03:56:44,210
Do I need to reset- I can't believe it's still processing!

5728
03:56:44,210 --> 03:56:47,710
Thank you for the super chat.

5729
03:56:47,810 --> 03:56:48,070
Thank you.

5730
03:56:48,150 --> 03:56:48,510
Thank you.

5731
03:56:48,610 --> 03:56:51,770
Collecting immortal monsters like Pokemon cards.

5732
03:56:56,430 --> 03:56:58,250
Where's the skull?!

5733
03:56:58,250 --> 03:57:00,970
Where's the skull?!

5734
03:57:02,450 --> 03:57:04,430
Where is it?!

5735
03:57:04,430 --> 03:57:05,010
Here!

5736
03:57:05,270 --> 03:57:06,550
Is it the treasure?

5737
03:57:07,190 --> 03:57:08,690
Is it the treasure?

5738
03:57:11,710 --> 03:57:13,450
Where is it?

5739
03:57:14,610 --> 03:57:15,790
Go to door 2.

5740
03:57:15,990 --> 03:57:17,670
Where- Is this door 2?

5741
03:57:23,490 --> 03:57:25,110
Is this door 2?

5742
03:57:25,350 --> 03:57:27,650
Is this- Is this the door?

5743
03:57:29,890 --> 03:57:30,450
No.

5744
03:57:32,030 --> 03:57:32,590
No!

5745
03:57:38,270 --> 03:57:38,830
Okay.

5746
03:57:38,830 --> 03:57:39,390
Okay.

5747
03:57:39,770 --> 03:57:40,330
Okay.

5748
03:57:45,870 --> 03:57:46,550
I hate this.

5749
03:57:46,730 --> 03:57:47,490
I hate this.

5750
03:57:47,570 --> 03:57:48,210
This is hell.

5751
03:57:48,610 --> 03:57:49,570
This is hell.

5752
03:57:49,650 --> 03:57:50,590
This is actual hell.

5753
03:57:50,710 --> 03:57:51,390
I found hell.

5754
03:57:51,670 --> 03:57:52,730
I found it.

5755
03:57:54,770 --> 03:57:55,950
Oh my god.

5756
03:57:55,990 --> 03:57:56,650
Real people!

5757
03:58:00,710 --> 03:58:01,990
This is fine.

5758
03:58:02,550 --> 03:58:03,710
Oh my god.

5759
03:58:03,750 --> 03:58:05,290
I'm so happy to see you.

5760
03:58:06,110 --> 03:58:08,290
I'm so happy to see you guys.

5761
03:58:08,470 --> 03:58:09,110
Son of a bitch!

5762
03:58:09,810 --> 03:58:11,310
Oh my god.

5763
03:58:13,130 --> 03:58:14,110
This is fine.

5764
03:58:14,190 --> 03:58:14,630
Turn around!

5765
03:58:14,630 --> 03:58:16,610
Real people!

5766
03:58:19,110 --> 03:58:20,610
Real people!

5767
03:58:21,170 --> 03:58:22,710
Oh, thank God!

5768
03:58:23,690 --> 03:58:25,810
What the fuck!

5769
03:58:30,120 --> 03:58:32,920
Okay, that was...

5770
03:58:32,920 --> 03:58:35,440
That was my bad, I actually didn't see you.

5771
03:58:36,140 --> 03:58:37,960
Where the fuck...

5772
03:58:37,960 --> 03:58:39,800
Where did he come from?

5773
03:58:40,980 --> 03:58:43,280
That guy scared the shit out of me!

5774
03:58:45,760 --> 03:58:47,440
Jeez, oh my God.

5775
03:58:52,320 --> 03:58:53,540
I looked away!

5776
03:58:53,660 --> 03:58:54,920
I looked away for one second.

5777
03:58:55,000 --> 03:58:57,280
I looked away, I looked away, I was freaking out guys.

5778
03:58:57,480 --> 03:58:58,540
I was freaking out.

5779
03:58:59,040 --> 03:59:00,840
Okay, I was freaking out.

5780
03:59:01,040 --> 03:59:01,780
I looked away.

5781
03:59:04,300 --> 03:59:05,700
Oh my God.

5782
03:59:07,720 --> 03:59:09,320
Oh my God.

5783
03:59:09,560 --> 03:59:10,940
I'm so sad.

5784
03:59:14,280 --> 03:59:16,520
I'm so sad.

5785
03:59:22,240 --> 03:59:23,120
I'm so sad.

5786
03:59:23,120 --> 03:59:23,920
Oh no!

5787
03:59:25,240 --> 03:59:26,920
There they are!

5788
03:59:31,420 --> 03:59:33,580
There's so many of them.

5789
03:59:35,840 --> 03:59:37,780
Where do I go?

5790
03:59:38,080 --> 03:59:39,940
It's just gonna break out.

5791
03:59:47,860 --> 03:59:48,980
Oh my

5792
03:59:56,870 --> 03:59:57,370
God.

5793
03:59:57,370 --> 03:59:59,170
They're just gonna break out, man.

5794
03:59:59,430 --> 04:00:00,390
They're just gonna break out, man.

5795
04:00:00,930 --> 04:00:02,570
Oh my God.

5796
04:00:06,760 --> 04:00:07,680
Oh my God.

5797
04:00:07,680 --> 04:00:08,420
There's the scope!

5798
04:00:09,140 --> 04:00:10,680
Oh my God, there it is!

5799
04:00:11,020 --> 04:00:12,040
There's the scope!

5800
04:00:12,120 --> 04:00:13,140
There it is!

5801
04:00:14,080 --> 04:00:16,000
Holy shit, there it is!

5802
04:00:17,460 --> 04:00:18,700
Where do I put it on?

5803
04:00:19,960 --> 04:00:20,520
LE5?

5804
04:00:20,800 --> 04:00:21,040
LE5?

5805
04:00:23,120 --> 04:00:26,160
I put it on the rifle, right?

5806
04:00:26,720 --> 04:00:28,460
I put it on the rifle, right?

5807
04:00:28,460 --> 04:00:28,800
The SR?

5808
04:00:29,580 --> 04:00:30,480
The SR?

5809
04:00:31,860 --> 04:00:32,500
Okay.

5810
04:00:34,880 --> 04:00:36,020
There's the scope.

5811
04:00:38,200 --> 04:00:38,840
There's the scope.

5812
04:00:42,460 --> 04:00:44,500
Very recent power outage.

5813
04:00:44,560 --> 04:00:48,800
A test subject awoke from the stasis, broke out of its holding tank, and escaped.

5814
04:00:49,160 --> 04:00:54,760
The subject was contained after 20 hours.

5815
04:00:58,940 --> 04:01:02,680
We were unable to recover one of the batteries and a tool from inside it.

5816
04:01:02,820 --> 04:01:06,040
The cause of this unfortunate incident is the unstable power supply.

5817
04:01:06,440 --> 04:01:09,280
The outdated generators cannot keep up with our demanding schedule.

5818
04:01:09,760 --> 04:01:16,200
Management must prioritize the needs of the engineer over those of the researchers to prevent something like this ever happening again.

5819
04:01:17,180 --> 04:01:17,780
to prevent something like this ever happening again.

5820
04:01:17,780 --> 04:01:18,580
Oh my God.

5821
04:01:18,620 --> 04:01:20,300
They're just looking at me like that.

5822
04:01:21,380 --> 04:01:22,700
Oh my God.

5823
04:01:22,700 --> 04:01:22,920
Oh my God.

5824
04:01:26,230 --> 04:01:27,470
Oh my God.

5825
04:01:27,510 --> 04:01:28,250
I hate this.

5826
04:01:29,370 --> 04:01:31,150
How do I trick...

5827
04:01:31,890 --> 04:01:32,330
Where?

5828
04:01:32,750 --> 04:01:34,130
Where do I get the wrench?

5829
04:01:34,570 --> 04:01:36,110
Where do I get the wrench?

5830
04:01:36,550 --> 04:01:37,910
Where do I get the wrench?

5831
04:01:37,950 --> 04:01:39,290
It's inside one of these guys.

5832
04:01:39,370 --> 04:01:40,630
It's inside these fuckers.

5833
04:01:40,750 --> 04:01:41,850
I can feel it.

5834
04:01:41,930 --> 04:01:43,890
It's inside these fuckers.

5835
04:01:44,210 --> 04:01:45,170
It's in there.

5836
04:01:45,410 --> 04:01:46,470
Oh, there it is.

5837
04:01:46,710 --> 04:01:47,490
I see it.

5838
04:01:47,550 --> 04:01:48,230
Do I shoot it?

5839
04:01:48,290 --> 04:01:48,890
I'm gonna shoot it.

5840
04:01:56,590 --> 04:01:57,170
What?

5841
04:01:57,950 --> 04:01:58,850
Here we go.

5842
04:02:00,250 --> 04:02:01,230
There we go.

5843
04:02:02,050 --> 04:02:02,630
Alright.

5844
04:02:03,670 --> 04:02:05,190
I figured it out.

5845
04:02:06,470 --> 04:02:07,670
I'm gonna shoot it.

5846
04:02:09,910 --> 04:02:11,110
Okay, here we go.

5847
04:02:15,620 --> 04:02:17,100
Oh my God.

5848
04:02:17,280 --> 04:02:18,420
Oh my God.

5849
04:02:19,480 --> 04:02:20,960
What the fuck?

5850
04:02:25,300 --> 04:02:25,880
Okay.

5851
04:02:26,340 --> 04:02:26,920
Nice.

5852
04:02:27,980 --> 04:02:29,560
Okay, there's the wrench.

5853
04:02:30,380 --> 04:02:31,060
There's the wrench.

5854
04:02:31,420 --> 04:02:32,760
There it is.

5855
04:02:33,160 --> 04:02:34,880
There it is.

5856
04:02:38,630 --> 04:02:39,650
Wrench time.

5857
04:02:40,910 --> 04:02:42,870
Oh, wrench time.

5858
04:02:44,650 --> 04:02:45,850
Key time.

5859
04:02:46,010 --> 04:02:46,970
Key time.

5860
04:02:49,050 --> 04:02:50,370
Oh, thank God.

5861
04:02:54,200 --> 04:02:55,420
Oh, thank God.

5862
04:02:55,460 --> 04:02:55,960
I'm fine.

5863
04:02:56,720 --> 04:02:58,760
I'm fine with like...

5864
04:03:00,280 --> 04:03:01,160
That's fine.

5865
04:03:05,050 --> 04:03:06,010
Alright, nice.

5866
04:03:06,070 --> 04:03:06,810
I got his leg.

5867
04:03:08,350 --> 04:03:08,950
Oh!

5868
04:03:09,750 --> 04:03:14,010
That's not fair.

5869
04:03:16,850 --> 04:03:17,750
Oh, shit!

5870
04:03:20,850 --> 04:03:21,590
Oh, fuck.

5871
04:03:22,830 --> 04:03:23,610
There we go.

5872
04:03:23,710 --> 04:03:24,910
He has no body now.

5873
04:03:25,130 --> 04:03:26,910
He has no body.

5874
04:03:28,450 --> 04:03:31,210
He has no body to regenerate!

5875
04:03:31,550 --> 04:03:32,410
He has no body to regenerate!

5876
04:03:33,350 --> 04:03:33,950
Okay.

5877
04:03:33,950 --> 04:03:35,170
I gotta...

5878
04:03:35,550 --> 04:03:36,630
I gotta reload.

5879
04:03:38,730 --> 04:03:39,690
There we go.

5880
04:03:39,750 --> 04:03:40,750
That hurts me!

5881
04:03:41,310 --> 04:03:41,850
Oh!

5882
04:03:43,870 --> 04:03:46,590
How was I supposed to know he was that close?

5883
04:03:49,590 --> 04:03:50,010
What?

5884
04:03:50,150 --> 04:03:51,250
Somebody get up?

5885
04:03:52,090 --> 04:03:52,930
No.

5886
04:03:54,190 --> 04:03:55,030
Oh!

5887
04:03:58,390 --> 04:04:00,010
Okay, reloading.

5888
04:04:00,930 --> 04:04:01,770
Reloading.

5889
04:04:04,110 --> 04:04:05,390
Oh, reloading!

5890
04:04:06,930 --> 04:04:07,570
Wooo!

5891
04:04:13,410 --> 04:04:16,370
I do not feel comfortable that they're just there.

5892
04:04:16,770 --> 04:04:20,210
I don't feel comfortable at all.

5893
04:04:22,770 --> 04:04:24,050
Oh, my God.

5894
04:04:24,130 --> 04:04:25,910
this sucks, this sucks, this sucks.

5895
04:04:26,030 --> 04:04:32,570
This fucking sucks.

5896
04:04:32,910 --> 04:04:34,430
I'm gonna suck so much.

5897
04:04:34,510 --> 04:04:36,010
Can't stop laughing.

5898
04:04:42,330 --> 04:04:43,930
They still have loot.

5899
04:04:44,010 --> 04:04:45,590
I don't want to kill them.

5900
04:04:47,950 --> 04:04:48,550
Bye.

5901
04:04:48,750 --> 04:04:49,210
Bye.

5902
04:04:49,690 --> 04:04:51,150
I'll do it for the loot.

5903
04:04:51,890 --> 04:04:53,430
I'll do it for the loot.

5904
04:04:56,410 --> 04:04:57,570
Okay, that's bullshit.

5905
04:04:57,870 --> 04:04:59,290
That is bullshit!

5906
04:04:59,390 --> 04:05:00,170
That's a hit!

5907
04:05:04,670 --> 04:05:05,850
That's a hit!

5908
04:05:07,630 --> 04:05:08,390
How?

5909
04:05:08,530 --> 04:05:09,890
What the fu-

5910
04:05:20,370 --> 04:05:23,650
Oh my god.

5911
04:05:23,890 --> 04:05:25,630
Bro, sometimes...

5912
04:05:26,490 --> 04:05:28,410
Sometimes I don't understand.

5913
04:05:28,530 --> 04:05:30,070
I don't understand.

5914
04:05:30,850 --> 04:05:32,790
Like, oh, that's a hit now.

5915
04:05:34,350 --> 04:05:36,950
You're shooting through a lot of flesh.

5916
04:05:38,410 --> 04:05:40,090
I don't understand.

5917
04:05:44,590 --> 04:05:47,710
Why didn't I save more of my ammo?

5918
04:05:47,890 --> 04:05:48,730
Why?

5919
04:05:51,110 --> 04:05:53,710
I should have saved some ammo.

5920
04:05:53,930 --> 04:05:56,170
I should have saved more ammo.

5921
04:05:56,330 --> 04:05:58,590
Why was this painted yellow with zero loot?

5922
04:05:58,830 --> 04:05:59,970
There's so many questions.

5923
04:06:06,320 --> 04:06:08,950
But the other two... I don't care!

5924
04:06:11,410 --> 04:06:13,010
Let them live!

5925
04:06:23,230 --> 04:06:23,830
Okay.

5926
04:06:27,710 --> 04:06:29,630
Ashley, I got the...

5927
04:06:37,260 --> 04:06:38,660
I don't care.

5928
04:06:38,760 --> 04:06:40,200
I don't care about the gold bar anymore.

5929
04:06:40,380 --> 04:06:41,520
Who fucking cares?

5930
04:06:41,620 --> 04:06:42,620
I don't care!

5931
04:06:42,760 --> 04:06:43,980
I just wanna leave.

5932
04:06:44,560 --> 04:06:44,860
I...

5933
04:06:44,860 --> 04:06:46,420
I have an

5934
04:06:51,050 --> 04:06:55,710
extra one.

5935
04:06:56,350 --> 04:06:57,170
Don't worry.

5936
04:06:57,350 --> 04:06:58,410
Can I?

5937
04:06:58,410 --> 04:07:01,650
You can take the vaccine to eliminate the bugs.

5938
04:07:06,150 --> 04:07:08,070
It's like the color of your hair too!

5939
04:07:15,200 --> 04:07:16,100
Wait, what?

5940
04:07:16,640 --> 04:07:17,960
I thought I got healed.

5941
04:07:20,100 --> 04:07:22,140
So what were we doing in the cave then?

5942
04:07:24,800 --> 04:07:27,260
What was Louis and I doing in the cave?

5943
04:07:40,740 --> 04:07:42,360
Oh, it was only temporary.

5944
04:07:42,560 --> 04:07:44,180
I was like, what the fuck was the point?

5945
04:07:47,660 --> 04:07:52,360
Oh my god, I hate, I hate the regenerators so fucking much.

5946
04:07:52,420 --> 04:07:53,680
I hate them so much.

5947
04:07:54,580 --> 04:07:55,060
Ashley!

5948
04:08:09,190 --> 04:08:10,310
You're okay, Ashley!

5949
04:08:15,790 --> 04:08:16,630
Can you stand?

5950
04:08:18,670 --> 04:08:19,210
Where's Louis?

5951
04:08:20,790 --> 04:08:21,430
Good question!

5952
04:08:21,930 --> 04:08:22,650
He's worried about you.

5953
04:08:24,310 --> 04:08:25,550
Yes, let me lie to her.

5954
04:08:25,890 --> 04:08:28,530
It's not like she's like in her 20s and can take a lie.

5955
04:08:30,910 --> 04:08:32,190
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

5956
04:08:32,250 --> 04:08:32,930
Thank you, thank you.

5957
04:08:34,850 --> 04:08:36,090
Edgar, thank you for the super chat.

5958
04:08:36,190 --> 04:08:36,690
Thank you, thank you.

5959
04:08:36,690 --> 04:08:37,770
Just a temporal relief.

5960
04:08:38,030 --> 04:08:39,850
If the bug matures, you need to take other measures.

5961
04:08:39,930 --> 04:08:41,190
Oh yeah, we have to like cut it open.

5962
04:08:45,430 --> 04:08:46,110
Ada, come in.

5963
04:08:46,630 --> 04:08:47,270
There's a lab.

5964
04:08:47,330 --> 04:08:47,470
We need to go.

5965
04:08:52,950 --> 04:08:53,470
Okay.

5966
04:08:53,470 --> 04:08:54,790
Give me your rifle.

5967
04:08:54,950 --> 04:08:55,990
I don't need the shotgun!

5968
04:09:06,200 --> 04:09:06,720
Okay.

5969
04:09:08,840 --> 04:09:09,900
Thank you, Ada.

5970
04:09:10,880 --> 04:09:11,600
Thank you.

5971
04:09:12,480 --> 04:09:13,880
Let me read the lore.

5972
04:09:14,200 --> 04:09:15,780
We are in prison without warning.

5973
04:09:16,020 --> 04:09:18,260
One by one, we are taken to the next room.

5974
04:09:18,600 --> 04:09:19,960
I don't know what happens there.

5975
04:09:20,100 --> 04:09:21,440
They just took Annabelle.

5976
04:09:21,440 --> 04:09:22,580
I'm probably next.

5977
04:09:22,920 --> 04:09:24,120
I've got to think.

5978
04:09:24,180 --> 04:09:25,560
I need to get my head straight.

5979
04:09:25,780 --> 04:09:29,440
All who are infected with the Plaga will be at the mercy of Lord Saddler.

5980
04:09:29,680 --> 04:09:34,360
If he commands it, they will work themselves to death with a smile on their face.

5981
04:09:35,040 --> 04:09:40,340
Adversely, the hosts become so simple-minded that they're basically useless for any complex task.

5982
04:09:40,760 --> 04:09:45,200
However, we succeeded in developing the new superior species of Plaga.

5983
04:09:45,340 --> 04:09:49,840
It has no special variability, but the host's cognitive functions are not diminished.

5984
04:09:50,220 --> 04:09:51,420
It seems like they plan to be a little more efficient than the other host.

5985
04:09:51,420 --> 04:09:53,660
They plan to administer this new species to the girl.

5986
04:09:53,880 --> 04:09:57,220
It's clearly important that she maintains her intelligence after infection.

5987
04:09:58,220 --> 04:10:02,600
All tests were successful and plans for mass production are moving forward.

5988
04:10:03,620 --> 04:10:05,760
The project is a complete success!

5989
04:10:06,320 --> 04:10:07,760
But I've been imprisoned.

5990
04:10:08,940 --> 04:10:13,680
And preparations to inject me with the superior species are underway in the next room.

5991
04:10:14,640 --> 04:10:16,420
Annabelle is not herself anymore.

5992
04:10:16,720 --> 04:10:19,660
The smile has been completely white from her face.

5993
04:10:20,040 --> 04:10:21,400
Writing is the only way.

5994
04:10:21,400 --> 04:10:23,000
The only thing that keeps me sane now.

5995
04:10:23,120 --> 04:10:25,260
Not that anyone ever read this.

5996
04:10:25,520 --> 04:10:27,140
Wait, does that mean I have the...

5997
04:10:27,140 --> 04:10:29,120
Do I have the...

5998
04:10:29,780 --> 04:10:30,380
Uh...

5999
04:10:31,160 --> 04:10:32,060
Uh, the...

6000
04:10:32,060 --> 04:10:35,200
The superior one or the dumb one?

6001
04:10:35,420 --> 04:10:36,840
I can't tell, Oblian.

6002
04:10:37,220 --> 04:10:37,820
I...

6003
04:10:37,820 --> 04:10:41,920
I can't tell.

6004
04:10:45,480 --> 04:10:46,680
Let's see...

6005
04:10:46,680 --> 04:10:47,740
Good question.

6006
04:10:51,400 --> 04:10:51,460
I...

6007
04:10:52,880 --> 04:10:53,920
I hate this.

6008
04:10:54,120 --> 04:10:55,420
Oh my god, I hate...

6009
04:10:55,420 --> 04:10:56,360
I hate you, Ashley.

6010
04:10:56,760 --> 04:10:58,140
I hate you so much.

6011
04:11:01,360 --> 04:11:02,740
Did you give me a boost?

6012
04:11:03,060 --> 04:11:03,440
Alright.

6013
04:11:06,200 --> 04:11:07,200
Okay, here we go.

6014
04:11:07,620 --> 04:11:09,620
Now I have to deal with the regenerators and you!

6015
04:11:10,160 --> 04:11:11,640
I should have kept you in there!

6016
04:11:12,440 --> 04:11:14,140
I should have locked you back in!

6017
04:11:14,180 --> 04:11:15,040
I have the key card!

6018
04:11:20,090 --> 04:11:21,550
I should have just locked her back in.

6019
04:11:21,610 --> 04:11:23,530
I literally have the key card to lock her back in.

6020
04:11:24,010 --> 04:11:24,050
I...

6021
04:11:28,850 --> 04:11:30,750
I'm pretty much a master of unlocking.

6022
04:11:31,310 --> 04:11:31,750
Alright.

6023
04:11:35,130 --> 04:11:37,290
Oh my god, the merchant is here.

6024
04:11:37,630 --> 04:11:42,010
If anyone has a moment of spirit, will you please turn these blue medallions into a broken mess on the floor?

6025
04:11:42,110 --> 04:11:45,110
I know that won't bring back the old days, but I can't let this stand.

6026
04:11:45,370 --> 04:11:47,190
Okay, where the fuck are the medallions?

6027
04:11:47,810 --> 04:11:49,010
They're all over here.

6028
04:11:49,250 --> 04:11:49,630
Okay.

6029
04:11:50,810 --> 04:11:52,810
God, get me off of this island!

6030
04:11:52,810 --> 04:11:55,210
Get me out of here!

6031
04:11:59,790 --> 04:12:02,930
I don't want to be here anymore.

6032
04:12:07,530 --> 04:12:09,350
Oh, there's the barrow.

6033
04:12:12,810 --> 04:12:13,550
Alright.

6034
04:12:13,990 --> 04:12:15,130
Let's see.

6035
04:12:16,410 --> 04:12:18,150
Yeah, I need some new shit.

6036
04:12:20,590 --> 04:12:22,010
Anything new?

6037
04:12:22,010 --> 04:12:23,710
What do you have for me that's new?

6038
04:12:23,830 --> 04:12:25,110
There's nothing new, you liar!

6039
04:12:27,190 --> 04:12:29,210
Oh, this is the same thing!

6040
04:12:31,090 --> 04:12:31,610
Okay.

6041
04:12:32,390 --> 04:12:33,750
Can you repair this?

6042
04:12:34,610 --> 04:12:37,010
And I need to repair my fucking knife.

6043
04:12:37,890 --> 04:12:39,690
And then... wrench.

6044
04:12:40,290 --> 04:12:41,230
Key card.

6045
04:12:42,570 --> 04:12:43,930
My crystal ore.

6046
04:12:45,110 --> 04:12:46,230
And then that's it.

6047
04:12:46,270 --> 04:12:46,750
Why the fuck?

6048
04:12:47,050 --> 04:12:47,810
Do I need to...

6049
04:12:47,810 --> 04:12:48,950
Can I sell the ore?

6050
04:12:49,470 --> 04:12:50,650
Can I get a knife?

6051
04:12:55,310 --> 04:12:56,970
Can I sell the ore?

6052
04:12:57,230 --> 04:12:57,370
Can I sell the ore?

6053
04:12:57,370 --> 04:12:58,190
Because I feel like...

6054
04:12:58,190 --> 04:12:59,110
Is it for selling only?

6055
04:12:59,290 --> 04:12:59,450
Yeah.

6056
04:12:59,610 --> 04:12:59,950
Okay.

6057
04:13:00,150 --> 04:13:01,450
Because it was like...

6058
04:13:02,830 --> 04:13:03,710
Because like...

6059
04:13:03,710 --> 04:13:05,110
It made me be like you...

6060
04:13:05,110 --> 04:13:07,810
It showed me a description for it so I couldn't tell.

6061
04:13:09,910 --> 04:13:10,350
Oh!

6062
04:13:10,770 --> 04:13:12,210
I can sell the SMG?

6063
04:13:12,750 --> 04:13:13,190
Alright.

6064
04:13:13,370 --> 04:13:14,590
I'm gonna sell the SMG.

6065
04:13:14,690 --> 04:13:15,210
Fuck this.

6066
04:13:15,410 --> 04:13:15,970
The LE5.

6067
04:13:16,030 --> 04:13:16,550
This one, right?

6068
04:13:18,410 --> 04:13:19,590
Is this the SMG?

6069
04:13:20,210 --> 04:13:21,390
Yeah, the submachine gun.

6070
04:13:21,390 --> 04:13:23,150
Yeah, I'm gonna sell the ammo for this too.

6071
04:13:24,930 --> 04:13:25,370
Okay.

6072
04:13:26,230 --> 04:13:26,670
Nice.

6073
04:13:26,690 --> 04:13:28,510
I'll sell the SMG.

6074
04:13:30,070 --> 04:13:31,310
It's already MP5.

6075
04:13:31,390 --> 04:13:32,470
Do I have an MP5?

6076
04:13:32,630 --> 04:13:33,530
No, I don't.

6077
04:13:33,690 --> 04:13:36,150
I was like, I'm pretty sure I don't.

6078
04:13:38,710 --> 04:13:40,010
Oh, fucking hell.

6079
04:13:40,730 --> 04:13:42,390
Alright, do I have enough to upgrade yet?

6080
04:13:43,010 --> 04:13:43,770
Tune up.

6081
04:13:45,050 --> 04:13:46,590
No, I need 100,000.

6082
04:13:51,390 --> 04:13:51,870
Oh...

6083
04:13:53,330 --> 04:13:54,610
Okay, here we go.

6084
04:14:01,150 --> 04:14:02,650
Stay close, Ashley.

6085
04:14:03,430 --> 04:14:05,570
No, I need you to stay close.

6086
04:14:07,370 --> 04:14:08,410
Stay close.

6087
04:14:10,210 --> 04:14:11,230
Alright, we're outside!

6088
04:14:11,690 --> 04:14:12,530
I like outside!

6089
04:14:17,410 --> 04:14:18,250
Outside, good!

6090
04:14:19,550 --> 04:14:20,270
Thank you.

6091
04:14:22,770 --> 04:14:23,490
Wait, what?

6092
04:14:25,570 --> 04:14:26,350
What's that sound?

6093
04:14:31,000 --> 04:14:32,280
Look, I needed that money.

6094
04:14:32,840 --> 04:14:33,400
Guys.

6095
04:14:38,150 --> 04:14:39,290
Wait, I hear something.

6096
04:14:41,190 --> 04:14:42,270
But like, where?

6097
04:14:44,310 --> 04:14:45,130
There's like...

6098
04:14:46,230 --> 04:14:48,130
There's like loot somewhere here.

6099
04:14:48,870 --> 04:14:49,690
But where?

6100
04:14:51,350 --> 04:14:53,430
How the fuck do I... Where is this loot?

6101
04:14:54,410 --> 04:14:55,570
I'm looking up.

6102
04:14:56,870 --> 04:14:57,730
Where is it?

6103
04:15:01,900 --> 04:15:03,540
Oh my god.

6104
04:15:03,540 --> 04:15:04,300
It's right here.

6105
04:15:07,340 --> 04:15:08,680
Oh my god.

6106
04:15:10,160 --> 04:15:11,540
Alright, shooting time!

6107
04:15:16,050 --> 04:15:16,890
Shooting time!

6108
04:15:19,030 --> 04:15:19,310
Hello?

6109
04:15:20,610 --> 04:15:24,620
Oh my god, where the fuck is the enemy?

6110
04:15:25,260 --> 04:15:26,480
I hear them.

6111
04:15:29,920 --> 04:15:31,000
God, I hear them.

6112
04:15:31,020 --> 04:15:32,880
I swear to god, if you're in the P corner...

6113
04:15:32,880 --> 04:15:34,180
Okay, there they are.

6114
04:15:36,520 --> 04:15:37,040
How?

6115
04:15:38,520 --> 04:15:39,940
Okay, just wait here, Ashley.

6116
04:15:43,880 --> 04:15:44,900
Just wait here!

6117
04:15:47,380 --> 04:15:48,140
That's fine!

6118
04:15:48,500 --> 04:15:50,120
We don't need to get closer!

6119
04:15:50,800 --> 04:15:52,160
Ashley, you're a detriment!

6120
04:15:55,850 --> 04:15:57,750
I'm worried about the...

6121
04:15:58,670 --> 04:16:02,010
I'm worried about them fucking showing up because of their P corner.

6122
04:16:02,010 --> 04:16:02,310
I'm worried about the P corner.

6123
04:16:04,570 --> 04:16:05,730
It's like right here.

6124
04:16:09,790 --> 04:16:10,810
What the fuck is this?

6125
04:16:15,700 --> 04:16:16,290
Where is it?

6126
04:16:16,470 --> 04:16:18,990
There's like a loot thing here somewhere.

6127
04:16:19,910 --> 04:16:22,550
I swear to god, I swear to god, if you're here...

6128
04:16:22,550 --> 04:16:24,490
I swear to god.

6129
04:16:25,450 --> 04:16:25,990
Alright.

6130
04:16:26,070 --> 04:16:27,630
Oh my god, Ashley, why?

6131
04:16:28,410 --> 04:16:30,410
Why are you still with me?

6132
04:16:33,050 --> 04:16:35,490
I missed the fucking medallion!

6133
04:16:36,290 --> 04:16:37,970
I can search trash cans?

6134
04:16:40,990 --> 04:16:41,390
What?

6135
04:16:41,950 --> 04:16:43,810
Oh my god, I can!

6136
04:16:47,230 --> 04:16:48,850
Wait, there is...

6137
04:16:48,850 --> 04:16:50,130
Wait, there was a...

6138
04:16:50,650 --> 04:16:51,590
Oh, there it is.

6139
04:16:52,170 --> 04:16:53,110
Yeah, I got it.

6140
04:16:55,290 --> 04:16:56,990
Oh my god, now I can search...

6141
04:16:56,990 --> 04:16:57,970
Oh, wait, there's ammo.

6142
04:16:58,210 --> 04:16:58,970
I'm sorry, Ashley.

6143
04:16:59,070 --> 04:17:00,070
This is important, Ashley.

6144
04:17:01,550 --> 04:17:04,390
I am a loot goblin and I need to obtain the ammo.

6145
04:17:05,610 --> 04:17:07,090
Oh, yeah, there was one here too, anyway.

6146
04:17:07,470 --> 04:17:08,110
What the fuck?

6147
04:17:09,590 --> 04:17:10,370
What the fuck?

6148
04:17:10,990 --> 04:17:11,610
There we go.

6149
04:17:13,830 --> 04:17:15,070
Where the fuck is that ammo?

6150
04:17:15,710 --> 04:17:16,850
Wait, how did I miss it again?

6151
04:17:18,370 --> 04:17:20,750
Okay, thank god I, like, turned around.

6152
04:17:23,950 --> 04:17:24,650
Where's the ammo?

6153
04:17:26,330 --> 04:17:27,090
Oh, it's here.

6154
04:17:27,170 --> 04:17:28,770
It was right in front of me this entire time.

6155
04:17:30,150 --> 04:17:30,990
God damn it.

6156
04:17:35,410 --> 04:17:35,770
Hello?

6157
04:17:40,090 --> 04:17:40,790
There we go.

6158
04:17:40,910 --> 04:17:41,030
There we go.

6159
04:17:41,030 --> 04:17:41,110
Crit.

6160
04:17:42,930 --> 04:17:44,410
I love me my crits.

6161
04:17:47,310 --> 04:17:47,790
Nice.

6162
04:17:50,030 --> 04:17:50,990
Oh, what?

6163
04:17:51,250 --> 04:17:51,730
What?

6164
04:17:53,030 --> 04:17:53,510
What?

6165
04:17:54,790 --> 04:17:55,270
What?

6166
04:17:56,450 --> 04:17:56,930
Okay.

6167
04:17:57,250 --> 04:17:58,750
I could have just done that.

6168
04:17:58,910 --> 04:17:59,470
Oh, well.

6169
04:18:00,710 --> 04:18:01,530
Oh, well.

6170
04:18:01,550 --> 04:18:02,930
I might have saved a lot.

6171
04:18:03,010 --> 04:18:07,210
I might have saved three bullets if I just walked to the side.

6172
04:18:11,730 --> 04:18:14,770
If only I just walked to the side.

6173
04:18:18,370 --> 04:18:19,170
Alright, five.

6174
04:18:19,250 --> 04:18:20,010
We did it.

6175
04:18:24,200 --> 04:18:25,180
What is this?

6176
04:18:25,640 --> 04:18:26,760
Oh, we don't need the money.

6177
04:18:26,960 --> 04:18:27,720
Do we need the money?

6178
04:18:28,520 --> 04:18:30,260
Ashley, are we that poor?

6179
04:18:32,600 --> 04:18:33,940
Ashley, are we that poor?

6180
04:18:34,040 --> 04:18:34,780
Do we need that money?

6181
04:18:35,940 --> 04:18:37,220
Can you find it?

6182
04:18:37,300 --> 04:18:38,100
Oh, my god.

6183
04:18:38,140 --> 04:18:38,980
Maybe we don't.

6184
04:18:38,980 --> 04:18:40,240
I don't want to find this.

6185
04:18:40,780 --> 04:18:41,040
I...

6186
04:18:41,580 --> 04:18:42,580
Oh, my god.

6187
04:18:42,600 --> 04:18:43,240
It's in front of me.

6188
04:18:43,480 --> 04:18:43,960
Okay.

6189
04:18:44,060 --> 04:18:44,320
We're fine.

6190
04:18:44,580 --> 04:18:46,660
This island is actually driving me insane.

6191
04:18:49,240 --> 04:18:52,560
I fucking hate this island so much right now.

6192
04:18:56,180 --> 04:18:58,400
This island is driving me crazy.

6193
04:19:04,260 --> 04:19:05,520
I'm just going to shoot the legs.

6194
04:19:06,240 --> 04:19:07,320
Oh, wait.

6195
04:19:07,420 --> 04:19:08,020
What the fuck?

6196
04:19:08,260 --> 04:19:08,740
Okay.

6197
04:19:11,320 --> 04:19:12,180
You know what?

6198
04:19:12,260 --> 04:19:12,440
Okay.

6199
04:19:12,440 --> 04:19:13,540
Oh, fuck this, man.

6200
04:19:19,240 --> 04:19:19,980
Here we go.

6201
04:19:20,960 --> 04:19:21,440
What?

6202
04:19:22,080 --> 04:19:23,740
How do you survive a grenade?

6203
04:19:24,820 --> 04:19:25,300
Oh!

6204
04:19:27,160 --> 04:19:28,520
Here we go.

6205
04:19:29,340 --> 04:19:30,380
There's no way.

6206
04:19:30,440 --> 04:19:30,840
Twice?

6207
04:19:33,840 --> 04:19:36,700
Ashley, I swear, I hope I did not accident...

6208
04:19:36,700 --> 04:19:37,480
Oh, nice.

6209
04:19:37,720 --> 04:19:39,320
He shot him to his own teammate.

6210
04:19:40,440 --> 04:19:41,100
That's good.

6211
04:19:42,280 --> 04:19:42,880
Alright, let's go.

6212
04:19:43,360 --> 04:19:43,980
I got it.

6213
04:19:43,980 --> 04:19:44,500
Alright, stab!

6214
04:19:47,680 --> 04:19:48,280
Nice.

6215
04:19:48,540 --> 04:19:49,040
Money!

6216
04:19:50,040 --> 04:19:50,640
Alright.

6217
04:19:51,060 --> 04:19:51,660
Fox.

6218
04:19:53,700 --> 04:19:55,380
Oh, fuck man.

6219
04:19:55,560 --> 04:19:56,380
I don't know.

6220
04:19:56,640 --> 04:19:57,460
I don't know!

6221
04:19:58,140 --> 04:20:01,680
On one hand, having Ashley here makes me less scared.

6222
04:20:01,740 --> 04:20:07,080
On the other hand, having Ashley here means she is more likely to die by the regenerators.

6223
04:20:08,920 --> 04:20:10,660
I don't know, Ashley.

6224
04:20:10,660 --> 04:20:10,960
Ashley...

6225
04:20:12,620 --> 04:20:16,320
I'm less scared, but also, you are gonna be such a pain.

6226
04:20:18,940 --> 04:20:20,860
Such a pain later!

6227
04:20:24,800 --> 04:20:25,900
Holy shit.

6228
04:20:26,020 --> 04:20:26,920
Alright, here we go.

6229
04:20:29,600 --> 04:20:31,240
I could just feel...

6230
04:20:31,240 --> 04:20:33,140
I could just feel it.

6231
04:20:34,600 --> 04:20:37,480
I could feel myself missing every possible shot...

6232
04:20:38,760 --> 04:20:39,720
while you die.

6233
04:20:42,400 --> 04:20:43,180
I could feel myself losing every possible shot...

6234
04:20:43,180 --> 04:20:43,200
Wait, what?

6235
04:20:45,860 --> 04:20:46,340
Oh!

6236
04:20:46,620 --> 04:20:47,100
Ashley!

6237
04:20:47,320 --> 04:20:47,940
Hang on.

6238
04:20:48,100 --> 04:20:49,220
Go do this thing.

6239
04:20:50,760 --> 04:20:51,240
Ashley.

6240
04:20:51,420 --> 04:20:53,100
Ashley, open that door for me.

6241
04:20:58,150 --> 04:20:58,630
Nice.

6242
04:21:06,150 --> 04:21:08,110
Oh no, am I by myself here now?

6243
04:21:12,110 --> 04:21:12,750
Am I?

6244
04:21:13,370 --> 04:21:14,930
Wait, there's a loo here.

6245
04:21:23,550 --> 04:21:24,230
Which way?

6246
04:21:26,050 --> 04:21:27,110
Which way do I go?

6247
04:21:31,190 --> 04:21:32,010
Which way?

6248
04:21:37,090 --> 04:21:38,710
Am I going the right way?

6249
04:21:38,930 --> 04:21:39,950
Oh, there it is.

6250
04:21:44,320 --> 04:21:45,240
Wait, what?

6251
04:21:46,360 --> 04:21:46,880
Already?

6252
04:21:48,820 --> 04:21:49,340
How?

6253
04:21:55,130 --> 04:21:56,410
Ashley, where are you?

6254
04:22:06,990 --> 04:22:08,890
I left you friends!

6255
04:22:19,600 --> 04:22:24,080
I left you for 30 seconds, Ashley.

6256
04:22:27,040 --> 04:22:32,540
I left you for 30 fucking seconds!

6257
04:22:36,240 --> 04:22:38,780
Holy fuck, really?

6258
04:22:38,780 --> 04:22:39,380
Really?

6259
04:22:40,020 --> 04:22:41,580
Fucking really?

6260
04:22:46,820 --> 04:22:52,920
Oh my god, I can't believe it, Ashley.

6261
04:22:58,240 --> 04:23:03,420
30 fucking seconds and you're dead.

6262
04:23:04,500 --> 04:23:05,400
Are you alright?

6263
04:23:06,120 --> 04:23:07,500
No, mentally?

6264
04:23:07,760 --> 04:23:08,180
No.

6265
04:23:08,840 --> 04:23:10,040
Absolutely not.

6266
04:23:11,200 --> 04:23:12,780
Absolutely not, Ashley.

6267
04:23:12,980 --> 04:23:14,660
I am not okay.

6268
04:23:18,660 --> 04:23:21,740
Oh my god, I have to do this again.

6269
04:23:26,080 --> 04:23:27,520
Alright, here we go.

6270
04:23:27,720 --> 04:23:29,080
Here we go.

6271
04:23:31,940 --> 04:23:34,640
Where did they go after?

6272
04:23:35,220 --> 04:23:36,640
No problem.

6273
04:23:41,930 --> 04:23:42,650
Alright.

6274
04:23:46,280 --> 04:23:47,320
Oh, this is...

6275
04:23:51,760 --> 04:23:53,080
Where did they go?

6276
04:23:53,600 --> 04:23:54,640
Where did they go?

6277
04:23:55,400 --> 04:23:55,940
Hang in there.

6278
04:23:58,300 --> 04:24:00,000
Do I actually kill- okay, I don't kill her.

6279
04:24:00,700 --> 04:24:04,660
I was going to say, what if I accidentally kill her there?

6280
04:24:06,700 --> 04:24:09,600
The point blank shot got shot.

6281
04:24:11,460 --> 04:24:14,380
I was like, that is the risk I'm willing to take.

6282
04:24:14,380 --> 04:24:15,140
I was willing to take Ashley.

6283
04:24:15,540 --> 04:24:23,560
I was willing to take that risk.

6284
04:24:28,760 --> 04:24:30,360
Thank fucking god.

6285
04:24:31,740 --> 04:24:33,040
Thank god you lived.

6286
04:24:36,160 --> 04:24:37,280
Problem solved.

6287
04:24:37,940 --> 04:24:38,780
I knew.

6288
04:24:38,880 --> 04:24:40,040
I knew I wouldn't hit her.

6289
04:24:40,340 --> 04:24:41,600
Guys, I just knew.

6290
04:24:42,480 --> 04:24:44,860
I knew that she would live.

6291
04:24:47,180 --> 04:24:49,460
Ashley, why are you... Ashley, stop!

6292
04:24:51,620 --> 04:24:52,360
Bro!

6293
04:24:53,000 --> 04:24:54,280
Ashley, stop!

6294
04:24:55,520 --> 04:24:57,740
You're fucking freaking me out!

6295
04:25:02,450 --> 04:25:04,780
She can't... I couldn't see!

6296
04:25:05,740 --> 04:25:06,480
Ashley!

6297
04:25:12,710 --> 04:25:13,780
Oh my god.

6298
04:25:14,020 --> 04:25:15,220
I don't... I can't.

6299
04:25:15,220 --> 04:25:16,720
I really can't be bothered.

6300
04:25:17,020 --> 04:25:17,700
Here we go.

6301
04:25:18,380 --> 04:25:19,220
Here we go.

6302
04:25:20,140 --> 04:25:22,500
I can't be bothered.

6303
04:25:25,860 --> 04:25:27,380
Oh my god.

6304
04:25:30,940 --> 04:25:32,140
Holy shit.

6305
04:25:32,220 --> 04:25:33,380
I don't miss you.

6306
04:25:33,420 --> 04:25:34,780
I do not miss you at all.

6307
04:25:37,980 --> 04:25:39,000
Don't leave me!

6308
04:25:39,260 --> 04:25:40,500
Where did you go?

6309
04:25:43,180 --> 04:25:45,100
Where did she go?

6310
04:25:47,940 --> 04:25:48,740
Where did she go?

6311
04:25:48,740 --> 04:25:48,740
What?

6312
04:25:49,020 --> 04:25:49,740
How?

6313
04:25:50,360 --> 04:25:51,860
Ashley, stop!

6314
04:25:57,100 --> 04:25:59,040
Where are you?

6315
04:26:00,100 --> 04:26:01,660
Jesus Christ.

6316
04:26:01,840 --> 04:26:03,080
Holy fuck.

6317
04:26:03,460 --> 04:26:05,580
Holy fucking shit.

6318
04:26:05,640 --> 04:26:06,300
I can't.

6319
04:26:06,300 --> 04:26:07,420
I can't with this girl.

6320
04:26:07,600 --> 04:26:09,000
I actually cannot.

6321
04:26:09,140 --> 04:26:09,500
Please.

6322
04:26:09,500 --> 04:26:11,440
Please, get in a fucking locker somewhere.

6323
04:26:12,020 --> 04:26:13,560
Like, I swear to God.

6324
04:26:13,620 --> 04:26:15,620
Just fucking get in the locker somewhere.

6325
04:26:16,000 --> 04:26:16,580
Okay.

6326
04:26:19,300 --> 04:26:20,720
Oh my god.

6327
04:26:25,510 --> 04:26:26,730
Smells pretty bad.

6328
04:26:27,030 --> 04:26:28,770
She needs a locker...

6329
04:26:28,770 --> 04:26:29,810
Yeah, I can tell.

6330
04:26:30,150 --> 04:26:31,190
I can tell!

6331
04:26:35,740 --> 04:26:36,320
Okay.

6332
04:26:36,320 --> 04:26:37,740
There is loot somewhere here.

6333
04:26:38,900 --> 04:26:38,900
Okay.

6334
04:26:41,960 --> 04:26:42,540
There is loot somewhere here.

6335
04:26:42,540 --> 04:26:42,540
Okay.

6336
04:26:42,640 --> 04:26:42,640
There is loot somewhere here.

6337
04:26:42,640 --> 04:26:43,420
Actually, why are you clipping?

6338
04:26:43,560 --> 04:26:45,200
Why are you clipping everything?

6339
04:26:46,840 --> 04:26:49,540
Please, you are driving me insane right now.

6340
04:26:55,640 --> 04:26:56,100
Please.

6341
04:27:00,280 --> 04:27:02,580
Alright, here we go.

6342
04:27:03,720 --> 04:27:04,440
Here we go.

6343
04:27:08,620 --> 04:27:09,080
Oh.

6344
04:27:10,120 --> 04:27:10,980
Oh, okay, okay.

6345
04:27:11,040 --> 04:27:11,940
Sorry, I couldn't understand.

6346
04:27:11,940 --> 04:27:16,520
I know I gave the instructions, but like I couldn't understand what they mean.

6347
04:27:16,680 --> 04:27:18,580
I couldn't...

6348
04:27:19,900 --> 04:27:23,500
I was like, I know you said we go at the same... Oh my... Go in.

6349
04:27:23,720 --> 04:27:24,580
Go in.

6350
04:27:24,820 --> 04:27:25,780
Live in here.

6351
04:27:25,960 --> 04:27:27,060
Live in here.

6352
04:27:30,560 --> 04:27:32,020
Just live in here.

6353
04:27:32,100 --> 04:27:33,440
It's regenerator time.

6354
04:27:34,400 --> 04:27:37,440
I assume this is where I do regenerator shit.

6355
04:27:38,060 --> 04:27:38,840
It's time.

6356
04:27:40,820 --> 04:27:41,640
That's fine.

6357
04:27:42,100 --> 04:27:45,000
As long as I don't have to deal with you.

6358
04:27:47,120 --> 04:27:48,780
Oh my god.

6359
04:27:52,060 --> 04:27:53,260
Stay there forever.

6360
04:27:53,560 --> 04:27:54,460
Just stay there.

6361
04:27:55,880 --> 04:27:57,180
Yep, there it is.

6362
04:28:00,460 --> 04:28:01,060
Yep.

6363
04:28:02,460 --> 04:28:03,640
There it is.

6364
04:28:05,860 --> 04:28:07,480
Oh my god.

6365
04:28:08,840 --> 04:28:09,780
I fucking knew it.

6366
04:28:11,060 --> 04:28:11,660
What?

6367
04:28:16,030 --> 04:28:16,630
What?

6368
04:28:25,490 --> 04:28:27,050
I'm shooting the head.

6369
04:28:27,470 --> 04:28:31,410
I swear.

6370
04:28:31,570 --> 04:28:33,170
I swear I'm shooting the head.

6371
04:28:37,470 --> 04:28:38,230
Okay, there we go.

6372
04:28:39,290 --> 04:28:39,890
Oh.

6373
04:28:44,470 --> 04:28:44,850
Jesus.

6374
04:28:45,550 --> 04:28:46,450
Cuddly bastard.

6375
04:28:48,910 --> 04:28:49,810
Holy fuck.

6376
04:28:50,230 --> 04:28:51,530
He's wiggly.

6377
04:28:54,110 --> 04:28:55,450
Oh my god.

6378
04:28:55,950 --> 04:28:56,390
Oh my god.

6379
04:28:56,390 --> 04:28:57,310
You're not hurt, are you?

6380
04:28:57,430 --> 04:28:58,290
Oh, thank god.

6381
04:28:58,390 --> 04:28:58,650
Okay.

6382
04:28:58,930 --> 04:28:59,850
Oh, you got it.

6383
04:28:59,890 --> 04:29:01,010
No, stay there.

6384
04:29:01,090 --> 04:29:02,050
Ashley, stay there.

6385
04:29:03,270 --> 04:29:03,710
Ashley.

6386
04:29:03,850 --> 04:29:04,290
Ashley.

6387
04:29:04,510 --> 04:29:04,950
Please.

6388
04:29:05,390 --> 04:29:06,670
Stay in the locker.

6389
04:29:06,690 --> 04:29:07,430
Ashley, please.

6390
04:29:08,030 --> 04:29:08,310
No problem.

6391
04:29:12,610 --> 04:29:13,570
Did I fuck up?

6392
04:29:14,010 --> 04:29:14,450
Whoops.

6393
04:29:14,670 --> 04:29:15,010
One more time.

6394
04:29:15,010 --> 04:29:16,170
What button do I press?

6395
04:29:16,850 --> 04:29:17,730
I thought...

6396
04:29:18,350 --> 04:29:18,790
Oh my god.

6397
04:29:19,810 --> 04:29:20,610
Oh my god.

6398
04:29:21,070 --> 04:29:21,510
Oh my god.

6399
04:29:22,330 --> 04:29:23,330
What button?

6400
04:29:23,330 --> 04:29:24,190
What button?

6401
04:29:24,270 --> 04:29:24,450
F.

6402
04:29:24,610 --> 04:29:25,070
Is it F?

6403
04:29:25,210 --> 04:29:26,150
Is it F?

6404
04:29:29,310 --> 04:29:29,830
Okay.

6405
04:29:31,030 --> 04:29:31,550
I...

6406
04:29:31,550 --> 04:29:32,150
One more time.

6407
04:29:32,330 --> 04:29:32,910
I can't.

6408
04:29:32,970 --> 04:29:34,290
I fucking can't.

6409
04:29:38,990 --> 04:29:39,510
What?

6410
04:29:39,950 --> 04:29:40,470
Why?

6411
04:29:40,630 --> 04:29:41,690
I pressed it.

6412
04:29:44,230 --> 04:29:45,270
I swear.

6413
04:29:45,950 --> 04:29:47,090
Oh my god.

6414
04:29:47,150 --> 04:29:47,890
There's like a delay.

6415
04:29:48,110 --> 04:29:48,910
I swear.

6416
04:29:48,950 --> 04:29:50,110
There is a delay, guys.

6417
04:29:50,150 --> 04:29:51,410
I swear to god.

6418
04:29:51,450 --> 04:29:52,050
There's a delay.

6419
04:29:52,530 --> 04:29:53,050
Okay.

6420
04:29:53,050 --> 04:29:53,810
I swear.

6421
04:29:54,210 --> 04:29:56,390
Chat, I didn't do that on purpose.

6422
04:29:56,710 --> 04:29:58,190
There's a fucking delay.

6423
04:29:58,430 --> 04:29:59,430
I swear.

6424
04:30:03,250 --> 04:30:05,490
I didn't do that on purpose.

6425
04:30:07,030 --> 04:30:08,770
There's like a three second delay.

6426
04:30:10,310 --> 04:30:10,910
No.

6427
04:30:11,350 --> 04:30:12,670
Not the power.

6428
04:30:15,070 --> 04:30:16,730
Oh my god.

6429
04:30:20,770 --> 04:30:21,370
Okay.

6430
04:30:21,550 --> 04:30:22,470
Leave it to me.

6431
04:30:22,490 --> 04:30:23,030
I'm actually pretty good.

6432
04:30:23,030 --> 04:30:23,650
I'm pretty good at this stuff.

6433
04:30:29,170 --> 04:30:29,730
Oh.

6434
04:30:35,610 --> 04:30:37,090
I swear to god, chat.

6435
04:30:37,430 --> 04:30:40,090
I swear to god there was a delay.

6436
04:30:44,300 --> 04:30:44,860
Boop.

6437
04:30:47,140 --> 04:30:48,340
Oh my god.

6438
04:30:48,480 --> 04:30:50,160
I hate this so much.

6439
04:30:51,580 --> 04:30:52,980
God, that's just a rat.

6440
04:30:54,000 --> 04:30:54,840
It's just a rat.

6441
04:30:55,820 --> 04:30:57,140
Just a fucking rat.

6442
04:31:05,310 --> 04:31:05,830
Run.

6443
04:31:07,670 --> 04:31:08,490
Run where?

6444
04:31:08,750 --> 04:31:09,290
Where do I...

6445
04:31:09,290 --> 04:31:13,990
Guys, I just saw someone say as soon as I turn the power, just run.

6446
04:31:14,150 --> 04:31:15,290
Where do I run?

6447
04:31:18,590 --> 04:31:20,190
You can't just say run.

6448
04:31:20,530 --> 04:31:21,910
Where do I run?

6449
04:31:22,550 --> 04:31:23,590
Just run.

6450
04:31:23,930 --> 04:31:25,270
Do I run back?

6451
04:31:25,530 --> 04:31:27,110
Do I run forward?

6452
04:31:27,770 --> 04:31:28,290
Where?

6453
04:31:30,670 --> 04:31:32,290
Where is that running?

6454
04:31:32,870 --> 04:31:33,390
Do I run?

6455
04:31:33,390 --> 04:31:33,450
Just run.

6456
04:31:33,450 --> 04:31:37,290
Thank you for the Hakkatsu, but thank you.

6457
04:31:44,690 --> 04:31:45,290
Okay.

6458
04:31:45,290 --> 04:31:45,890
Okay.

6459
04:31:47,470 --> 04:31:48,070
Run.

6460
04:31:48,070 --> 04:31:49,430
Where is the power?

6461
04:32:12,900 --> 04:32:14,060
Where is it?

6462
04:32:19,450 --> 04:32:20,950
Did I go the wrong way?

6463
04:32:24,150 --> 04:32:25,710
Oh, there's stuff here.

6464
04:32:26,810 --> 04:32:27,630
There's fish.

6465
04:32:28,870 --> 04:32:30,290
And then there's herbs.

6466
04:32:34,090 --> 04:32:35,070
Alright, here we go.

6467
04:32:38,610 --> 04:32:40,470
Apparently I gotta start running.

6468
04:32:44,680 --> 04:32:46,140
Oh my god, I'm running.

6469
04:32:46,680 --> 04:32:47,480
I'm running.

6470
04:32:47,640 --> 04:32:48,700
Ashley, where are you?

6471
04:32:50,880 --> 04:32:51,400
Ashley?

6472
04:32:53,520 --> 04:32:55,140
Where did you go, Ashley?

6473
04:32:55,720 --> 04:32:56,240
Ashley!

6474
04:32:56,300 --> 04:32:57,300
Ashley!

6475
04:32:57,920 --> 04:32:59,000
Ashley!

6476
04:33:01,100 --> 04:33:01,800
Leon!

6477
04:33:08,070 --> 04:33:09,470
What

6478
04:33:16,020 --> 04:33:18,160
the fuck?

6479
04:33:19,100 --> 04:33:24,820
What the... what was that?

6480
04:33:32,470 --> 04:33:34,530
Ashley, what the fuck?

6481
04:33:37,130 --> 04:33:38,970
Ashley, fuck!

6482
04:33:39,090 --> 04:33:39,770
Ashley, damn it!

6483
04:33:39,770 --> 04:33:41,710
Oh my... what?

6484
04:33:42,410 --> 04:33:44,210
What was that?

6485
04:33:44,430 --> 04:33:46,970
What the fuck was that?

6486
04:33:47,470 --> 04:33:48,090
Ashley!

6487
04:33:51,110 --> 04:33:53,710
How do you do this?

6488
04:33:57,390 --> 04:33:58,470
Dude...

6489
04:33:58,470 --> 04:33:59,730
Okay.

6490
04:34:00,810 --> 04:34:02,110
Oh shit!

6491
04:34:02,730 --> 04:34:04,630
Oh my god!

6492
04:34:05,070 --> 04:34:05,630
Keep coming.

6493
04:34:09,770 --> 04:34:10,070
Thanks.

6494
04:34:10,410 --> 04:34:11,230
You're welcome.

6495
04:34:11,230 --> 04:34:13,810
I can't believe I saw that.

6496
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:15,130
I can't...

6497
04:34:17,990 --> 04:34:20,770
I can't believe I did that.

6498
04:34:20,890 --> 04:34:23,750
I can't believe that was real.

6499
04:34:24,150 --> 04:34:26,170
I can't believe that was real!

6500
04:34:26,930 --> 04:34:29,890
Doki plus fear equals a Looney Tunes episode.

6501
04:34:30,210 --> 04:34:31,930
Girls, thank you for the super chat.

6502
04:34:32,030 --> 04:34:32,910
Thank you, thank you.

6503
04:34:33,490 --> 04:34:34,950
Oh my god.

6504
04:34:35,370 --> 04:34:36,710
I literally just saw her!

6505
04:34:37,270 --> 04:34:37,790
I...

6506
04:34:37,790 --> 04:34:41,470
Okay, the worst part was that I saw her...

6507
04:34:41,470 --> 04:34:43,050
I'm not fucking going back for that loot.

6508
04:34:43,170 --> 04:34:45,010
I don't care enough for this.

6509
04:34:45,250 --> 04:34:46,650
I saw... she just...

6510
04:34:46,650 --> 04:34:51,930
They just stood there behind her until I crossed the fucking bridge.

6511
04:34:52,430 --> 04:34:55,590
I can't believe that like...

6512
04:34:55,590 --> 04:34:57,770
That was so bullshit.

6513
04:34:57,850 --> 04:34:59,230
Oh my god.

6514
04:34:59,530 --> 04:35:05,710
That was actually the most fucking ridiculous shit I've ever...

6515
04:35:05,710 --> 04:35:06,930
I just can't.

6516
04:35:08,750 --> 04:35:10,850
Like, how is that real?

6517
04:35:12,150 --> 04:35:14,090
How is that fucking real?

6518
04:35:19,170 --> 04:35:21,290
That does not feel real.

6519
04:35:25,150 --> 04:35:26,490
I'm not going...

6520
04:35:26,490 --> 04:35:28,390
I do not care enough for this.

6521
04:35:29,310 --> 04:35:30,670
What the fuck?

6522
04:35:31,650 --> 04:35:33,230
Bro, what the...

6523
04:35:33,230 --> 04:35:35,270
Bro, what is...

6524
04:35:36,210 --> 04:35:36,910
I'm not going...

6525
04:35:39,150 --> 04:35:39,710
What?

6526
04:35:40,070 --> 04:35:40,630
What?

6527
04:35:48,310 --> 04:35:48,870
Okay.

6528
04:35:49,870 --> 04:35:50,430
Oh...

6529
04:35:51,610 --> 04:35:52,170
Okay.

6530
04:35:56,270 --> 04:35:58,210
What the fuck is he doing?

6531
04:35:59,290 --> 04:36:00,350
Okay, here we go.

6532
04:36:02,670 --> 04:36:03,290
Let's go.

6533
04:36:03,530 --> 04:36:04,230
Let's go, Ashley.

6534
04:36:04,710 --> 04:36:06,790
Took care of her a quest, did you?

6535
04:36:06,790 --> 04:36:07,610
Yes, I did.

6536
04:36:07,970 --> 04:36:09,050
Okay, there we go.

6537
04:36:09,070 --> 04:36:09,590
The rats.

6538
04:36:10,390 --> 04:36:12,530
Exterminate all the rats in the waste disposal.

6539
04:36:12,990 --> 04:36:15,810
So help me keep things clean and take care of those tiny critters.

6540
04:36:16,490 --> 04:36:17,290
But which...

6541
04:36:17,290 --> 04:36:17,690
Here?

6542
04:36:20,190 --> 04:36:20,610
Disposal?

6543
04:36:20,810 --> 04:36:21,650
God, I don't want to...

6544
04:36:21,650 --> 04:36:22,930
I don't want to go back.

6545
04:36:24,110 --> 04:36:24,890
I don't care.

6546
04:36:25,010 --> 04:36:25,650
This is going to be...

6547
04:36:25,650 --> 04:36:26,290
Oh my god.

6548
04:36:26,330 --> 04:36:27,250
I don't want to go back.

6549
04:36:27,450 --> 04:36:29,210
I don't want to go back.

6550
04:36:30,050 --> 04:36:30,470
Alright.

6551
04:36:31,210 --> 04:36:31,630
This...

6552
04:36:32,470 --> 04:36:35,830
This makes or breaks if I go back to do the rats.

6553
04:36:35,830 --> 04:36:38,770
Will there be anybody else trying to kill me?

6554
04:36:40,110 --> 04:36:44,330
Guys, if I go back, are there going to be enemies there?

6555
04:36:44,570 --> 04:36:46,490
This will make or break it.

6556
04:36:51,650 --> 04:36:52,990
Oh my god.

6557
04:36:54,370 --> 04:36:56,050
Holy shit, pro.

6558
04:36:56,690 --> 04:36:57,130
Pro.

6559
04:36:57,210 --> 04:36:58,950
Ashley like ages me here.

6560
04:37:00,250 --> 04:37:01,090
Okay, one...

6561
04:37:01,890 --> 04:37:02,970
Okay, I need two.

6562
04:37:03,170 --> 04:37:04,150
Okay, one, two.

6563
04:37:04,290 --> 04:37:05,370
And then I need a yellow.

6564
04:37:05,990 --> 04:37:07,310
Wait, I should know I can do this.

6565
04:37:07,390 --> 04:37:07,730
Wait, I can.

6566
04:37:08,230 --> 04:37:09,690
Okay, I can do it.

6567
04:37:10,610 --> 04:37:11,010
Okay.

6568
04:37:12,850 --> 04:37:13,710
Okay, here we go.

6569
04:37:13,790 --> 04:37:14,990
I need to put that here.

6570
04:37:15,690 --> 04:37:17,650
And then I'll put that here.

6571
04:37:20,710 --> 04:37:21,930
Okay, that should be it.

6572
04:37:23,350 --> 04:37:23,750
Oh!

6573
04:37:24,770 --> 04:37:25,170
Alright.

6574
04:37:26,590 --> 04:37:27,650
Alright, here we go.

6575
04:37:27,750 --> 04:37:28,070
Sell.

6576
04:37:28,990 --> 04:37:29,390
Gold.

6577
04:37:30,510 --> 04:37:30,910
Necklace.

6578
04:37:31,970 --> 04:37:32,370
Boop.

6579
04:37:33,010 --> 04:37:34,030
I think I have...

6580
04:37:34,030 --> 04:37:35,250
Wait, I have enough for the upgrade.

6581
04:37:36,090 --> 04:37:36,730
Yeah.

6582
04:37:36,830 --> 04:37:37,470
Okay, nice.

6583
04:37:38,070 --> 04:37:41,210
I'll grab the upgrade for the rifle.

6584
04:37:42,830 --> 04:37:43,150
Oh!

6585
04:37:43,810 --> 04:37:44,870
Alright, save.

6586
04:37:45,850 --> 04:37:49,270
Alright, I'm going to use the bathroom before we go walk through the rats.

6587
04:37:49,350 --> 04:37:49,950
I'll be right back.

6588
04:38:50,810 --> 04:38:51,450
I...

6589
04:38:51,450 --> 04:38:53,670
I hate Ashley so much.

6590
04:38:54,270 --> 04:38:55,550
I'm feeling...

6591
04:38:55,550 --> 04:38:57,490
Thank you for the super chat.

6592
04:38:57,570 --> 04:38:57,950
Thank you.

6593
04:38:58,850 --> 04:39:02,170
I've never hated a game character.

6594
04:39:02,170 --> 04:39:03,530
This much before.

6595
04:39:08,290 --> 04:39:16,130
I've never hated a video game character as much as I've hated Ashley.

6596
04:39:16,450 --> 04:39:18,770
Oh my god.

6597
04:39:20,890 --> 04:39:23,430
It is actually crazy.

6598
04:39:23,950 --> 04:39:24,690
I...

6599
04:39:24,690 --> 04:39:26,230
I don't care.

6600
04:39:26,510 --> 04:39:26,970
I...

6601
04:39:32,750 --> 04:39:33,250
I just...

6602
04:39:33,250 --> 04:39:34,070
Oh my god.

6603
04:39:35,870 --> 04:39:37,250
Oh my god.

6604
04:39:37,310 --> 04:39:38,310
Alright, here we go.

6605
04:39:38,530 --> 04:39:39,110
Hear any?

6606
04:39:39,870 --> 04:39:40,870
I hear a rat.

6607
04:39:41,430 --> 04:39:42,410
I hear you.

6608
04:39:44,030 --> 04:39:44,530
Okay.

6609
04:39:45,650 --> 04:39:46,150
Oh!

6610
04:39:47,910 --> 04:39:49,470
I knew you were there.

6611
04:39:50,950 --> 04:39:53,710
I'm going to save because I don't want to shoot that rat again.

6612
04:39:54,010 --> 04:39:54,970
Which one is worse?

6613
04:39:55,170 --> 04:39:56,590
OG Ashley or New...

6614
04:39:56,590 --> 04:40:00,810
The thing is, I've never gotten this far with OG Ashley.

6615
04:40:01,010 --> 04:40:02,150
In OG Ashley, I would rather kill the rat than the rat.

6616
04:40:02,150 --> 04:40:07,130
I got to the part where we had to escort... where we played her solo level.

6617
04:40:07,350 --> 04:40:08,630
That was as far as we got.

6618
04:40:08,930 --> 04:40:10,290
The OG Ashley.

6619
04:40:10,690 --> 04:40:12,230
So like, I don't know.

6620
04:40:13,970 --> 04:40:15,290
They're both terrible.

6621
04:40:17,670 --> 04:40:20,010
They're both absolutely terrible.

6622
04:40:24,900 --> 04:40:26,120
Oh my god.

6623
04:40:30,280 --> 04:40:30,800
Okay.

6624
04:40:32,300 --> 04:40:33,480
I need a no, guys.

6625
04:40:35,320 --> 04:40:36,400
I need a no.

6626
04:40:37,100 --> 04:40:38,460
Where are the other two rats?

6627
04:40:40,440 --> 04:40:42,640
Where the fuck are the other two rats?

6628
04:40:49,870 --> 04:40:52,290
Where is the two rats?!

6629
04:40:59,480 --> 04:41:00,620
Oh my god.

6630
04:41:02,040 --> 04:41:04,340
I don't know where the other rats are!

6631
04:41:07,500 --> 04:41:09,080
I got the boxes though.

6632
04:41:12,780 --> 04:41:14,320
Oh my god, there's one of them.

6633
04:41:15,800 --> 04:41:16,820
I hate you.

6634
04:41:16,860 --> 04:41:17,940
I hate you so much.

6635
04:41:21,880 --> 04:41:23,080
Where's the last rat?

6636
04:41:23,180 --> 04:41:25,440
Where the fuck... I'm not getting the fish.

6637
04:41:27,820 --> 04:41:29,640
Where the fuck is the last rat?

6638
04:41:30,260 --> 04:41:30,780
Nothing.

6639
04:41:31,220 --> 04:41:33,260
Oh my god, you thought you could hide.

6640
04:41:33,500 --> 04:41:35,000
You thought you could hide.

6641
04:41:35,440 --> 04:41:37,000
I fucking see you.

6642
04:41:38,140 --> 04:41:39,820
Jesus Christ, I see you.

6643
04:41:40,380 --> 04:41:43,840
They heard the gunfire and jeez it.

6644
04:41:44,240 --> 04:41:45,920
Thank you for the super chat.

6645
04:41:46,000 --> 04:41:46,540
Thank you.

6646
04:41:46,560 --> 04:41:47,260
Thank you.

6647
04:41:47,260 --> 04:41:50,000
Thank you for the super chat.

6648
04:41:50,200 --> 04:41:50,940
Thanks for the super chat.

6649
04:41:50,940 --> 04:41:52,440
Oh my god.

6650
04:41:52,660 --> 04:41:53,000
Oh my god.

6651
04:41:53,620 --> 04:41:54,540
Let's go.

6652
04:41:54,680 --> 04:41:55,740
Let's go, Ashley.

6653
04:41:55,980 --> 04:41:56,700
I'm done.

6654
04:41:57,040 --> 04:41:58,380
I'm so done.

6655
04:42:00,010 --> 04:42:01,100
So done.

6656
04:42:02,780 --> 04:42:04,020
Get over here.

6657
04:42:05,120 --> 04:42:06,420
I got the request.

6658
04:42:07,740 --> 04:42:09,500
I did it.

6659
04:42:09,660 --> 04:42:11,240
I fucking did it.

6660
04:42:11,460 --> 04:42:11,840
Yay!

6661
04:42:15,460 --> 04:42:16,200
Yay!

6662
04:42:18,180 --> 04:42:19,460
Save time.

6663
04:42:19,540 --> 04:42:20,980
We're gonna break a hundred guys!

6664
04:42:21,600 --> 04:42:23,720
We're gonna break a hundred!

6665
04:42:24,580 --> 04:42:26,000
We're almost there!

6666
04:42:27,560 --> 04:42:28,000
Boop!

6667
04:42:29,680 --> 04:42:31,220
Alright, where do I go?

6668
04:42:33,100 --> 04:42:34,260
I don't like this.

6669
04:42:34,980 --> 04:42:37,020
I'm getting my shotgun just in case.

6670
04:42:39,160 --> 04:42:40,440
I don't like this.

6671
04:42:41,740 --> 04:42:42,380
What?

6672
04:42:42,460 --> 04:42:43,080
Oh my god.

6673
04:42:43,260 --> 04:42:43,900
Fall.

6674
04:42:44,340 --> 04:42:44,980
Fall!

6675
04:42:49,060 --> 04:42:50,560
I'll never trust again.

6676
04:42:51,760 --> 04:42:52,320
Guys!

6677
04:42:52,940 --> 04:42:53,960
Oh my god.

6678
04:42:54,000 --> 04:42:55,780
Why is there so many fucking fire stuff?

6679
04:42:58,920 --> 04:42:59,900
What are you doing?

6680
04:43:00,040 --> 04:43:01,520
Ashley, what are you doing?

6681
04:43:09,310 --> 04:43:09,870
Skizz.

6682
04:43:15,150 --> 04:43:15,990
Oh god.

6683
04:43:16,350 --> 04:43:16,710
Oh god.

6684
04:43:16,730 --> 04:43:17,390
Oh here we go.

6685
04:43:17,510 --> 04:43:18,270
We're gonna smash!

6686
04:43:19,070 --> 04:43:19,510
Smash!

6687
04:43:19,590 --> 04:43:19,750
Smash!

6688
04:43:20,010 --> 04:43:20,410
Wrecking ball!

6689
04:43:24,930 --> 04:43:26,230
I'm eating my tangerines.

6690
04:43:28,570 --> 04:43:29,470
Just go smash!

6691
04:43:29,670 --> 04:43:30,610
I don't care anymore.

6692
04:43:31,750 --> 04:43:32,510
You're serious?

6693
04:43:40,140 --> 04:43:41,400
Am I controlling anything?

6694
04:43:41,660 --> 04:43:41,920
No?

6695
04:43:42,220 --> 04:43:43,840
Is this what they teach kids in school these days?

6696
04:43:44,540 --> 04:43:45,780
Ashley, you're not certified!

6697
04:43:49,460 --> 04:43:50,000
You're back!

6698
04:43:51,680 --> 04:43:52,980
Is this what they teach people in school these days?

6699
04:43:52,980 --> 04:43:54,440
Is this one private school?

6700
04:43:54,720 --> 04:43:55,660
Like ultra private school?

6701
04:43:56,000 --> 04:43:59,980
The one with the celebrities and the president's daughters?

6702
04:44:03,220 --> 04:44:06,020
Am I supposed to... Oh my god, I'm supposed to fucking protect her.

6703
04:44:06,200 --> 04:44:08,000
Oh my fucking god!

6704
04:44:13,460 --> 04:44:14,020
Nooooo!

6705
04:44:17,500 --> 04:44:18,640
Oh my god.

6706
04:44:20,720 --> 04:44:21,560
Of course.

6707
04:44:22,040 --> 04:44:24,120
Of course I have to protect her!

6708
04:44:28,880 --> 04:44:30,180
Of course I do!

6709
04:44:36,010 --> 04:44:36,530
Okay.

6710
04:44:36,530 --> 04:44:37,810
Where are the other ones?

6711
04:44:37,930 --> 04:44:39,230
Where are the other ones?

6712
04:44:39,270 --> 04:44:40,530
Why are you over here?

6713
04:44:47,670 --> 04:44:48,550
There they are.

6714
04:44:50,830 --> 04:44:51,750
Oh my god.

6715
04:44:51,990 --> 04:44:53,490
No, my 70%!

6716
04:45:00,070 --> 04:45:01,050
Oh no.

6717
04:45:02,710 --> 04:45:03,590
Oh no!

6718
04:45:06,390 --> 04:45:06,910
Okay.

6719
04:45:06,910 --> 04:45:07,510
It's fine.

6720
04:45:09,030 --> 04:45:09,790
It's fine.

6721
04:45:09,830 --> 04:45:10,930
It's... It's fine!

6722
04:45:13,450 --> 04:45:13,970
It's fine.

6723
04:45:13,970 --> 04:45:14,890
It is so fine.

6724
04:45:17,630 --> 04:45:18,390
There we go.

6725
04:45:18,650 --> 04:45:19,670
I told you.

6726
04:45:19,710 --> 04:45:20,550
It's so fine.

6727
04:45:20,990 --> 04:45:22,190
We're so okay.

6728
04:45:24,690 --> 04:45:25,210
Alright.

6729
04:45:26,390 --> 04:45:26,910
See?

6730
04:45:27,110 --> 04:45:28,290
Nothing to worry about.

6731
04:45:28,450 --> 04:45:30,670
My fucking crane is still full HP.

6732
04:45:31,270 --> 04:45:32,790
Why are you just giving me money?

6733
04:45:34,030 --> 04:45:35,470
Why is it just money?

6734
04:45:37,670 --> 04:45:38,530
Is that it?

6735
04:45:38,650 --> 04:45:39,110
Is that it?

6736
04:45:40,950 --> 04:45:41,750
Don't hurt me.

6737
04:45:41,790 --> 04:45:42,890
Just don't hurt me, Ashley.

6738
04:45:48,570 --> 04:45:49,130
Yay!

6739
04:45:50,930 --> 04:45:51,790
Ashley, no!

6740
04:45:55,130 --> 04:45:56,890
That's what you said last time!

6741
04:46:00,950 --> 04:46:03,170
You said that last time, Ashley!

6742
04:46:03,530 --> 04:46:04,470
You lied!

6743
04:46:07,570 --> 04:46:09,110
Oh, come on!

6744
04:46:09,110 --> 04:46:09,430
Come on!

6745
04:46:13,250 --> 04:46:13,650
Bro!

6746
04:46:22,870 --> 04:46:23,590
Oh, shit!

6747
04:46:24,290 --> 04:46:25,070
My shoulder!

6748
04:46:28,730 --> 04:46:29,730
Oh, this is bad.

6749
04:46:29,770 --> 04:46:30,170
This is bad.

6750
04:46:30,190 --> 04:46:30,610
This is bad.

6751
04:46:30,610 --> 04:46:31,210
This is so bad.

6752
04:46:31,250 --> 04:46:31,910
This is so bad.

6753
04:46:32,010 --> 04:46:32,910
This is so bad.

6754
04:46:32,910 --> 04:46:33,610
This is so bad.

6755
04:46:33,630 --> 04:46:34,270
This is so bad.

6756
04:46:37,710 --> 04:46:39,070
You are screaming!

6757
04:46:40,250 --> 04:46:41,030
I'm screaming!

6758
04:46:46,070 --> 04:46:46,470
Ashley!

6759
04:46:46,910 --> 04:46:46,990
This!

6760
04:46:52,630 --> 04:46:53,670
Oh my god.

6761
04:46:53,810 --> 04:46:55,850
Bro, Ashley, I'm trying!

6762
04:47:03,710 --> 04:47:08,330
Ashley, I am going through more than you right now.

6763
04:47:08,650 --> 04:47:09,250
Oh, jeez.

6764
04:47:13,570 --> 04:47:14,670
Oh my god.

6765
04:47:16,910 --> 04:47:18,570
I'm going through so much shit right now.

6766
04:47:21,010 --> 04:47:22,490
Holy shit, thank you.

6767
04:47:22,850 --> 04:47:24,250
Thank you for the ammo.

6768
04:47:24,950 --> 04:47:26,310
Thank you so much.

6769
04:47:28,270 --> 04:47:29,310
Holy fuck!

6770
04:47:29,890 --> 04:47:30,930
You craft.

6771
04:47:31,370 --> 04:47:33,950
Oh my god, I'm so fucked up right now.

6772
04:47:35,130 --> 04:47:36,630
This is fine.

6773
04:47:37,910 --> 04:47:39,150
This is so fine.

6774
04:47:39,270 --> 04:47:39,790
Get out.

6775
04:47:39,870 --> 04:47:40,610
Get the fuck out.

6776
04:47:42,250 --> 04:47:43,090
Get out!

6777
04:47:43,930 --> 04:47:44,790
Get out!

6778
04:47:47,150 --> 04:47:49,650
Okay, there must be more ammo here.

6779
04:47:50,590 --> 04:47:51,750
Oh my god.

6780
04:47:52,950 --> 04:47:53,470
Please.

6781
04:47:54,790 --> 04:47:55,310
Please.

6782
04:47:56,590 --> 04:47:57,110
Please.

6783
04:47:57,770 --> 04:47:58,670
Oh, thank you.

6784
04:47:59,630 --> 04:48:00,410
Thank you.

6785
04:48:01,370 --> 04:48:02,630
Thank you so much.

6786
04:48:05,470 --> 04:48:07,270
I dealt with so much today.

6787
04:48:09,370 --> 04:48:11,110
I went through so much pain.

6788
04:48:13,770 --> 04:48:14,290
Alright.

6789
04:48:14,850 --> 04:48:15,990
Alright, get out Ashley.

6790
04:48:16,910 --> 04:48:17,450
It's time.

6791
04:48:20,970 --> 04:48:22,310
Thank you for the loot.

6792
04:48:22,450 --> 04:48:23,510
Thank you so much.

6793
04:48:23,930 --> 04:48:27,230
There has been sighting of what appears to be a strange corpse wandering around.

6794
04:48:27,370 --> 04:48:29,170
Likely the result of some immortal experiment.

6795
04:48:29,770 --> 04:48:34,050
Once someone put it out of its misery and its pathetic existence.

6796
04:48:35,270 --> 04:48:36,090
Incubation lab.

6797
04:48:36,310 --> 04:48:37,650
Are you kidding me?

6798
04:48:41,890 --> 04:48:43,790
Isn't that all the way back here?

6799
04:48:51,430 --> 04:48:52,210
Don't worry guys.

6800
04:48:52,290 --> 04:48:53,410
I'm definitely gonna come back!

6801
04:48:58,330 --> 04:48:59,010
Don't worry.

6802
04:49:01,150 --> 04:49:01,790
Don't worry.

6803
04:49:02,350 --> 04:49:03,430
We're gonna come back.

6804
04:49:08,110 --> 04:49:09,330
Alright, let's see.

6805
04:49:10,250 --> 04:49:11,470
I think we gotta push this.

6806
04:49:17,260 --> 04:49:18,060
Don't worry guys.

6807
04:49:18,160 --> 04:49:19,400
I swear we're gonna come back, guys.

6808
04:49:25,960 --> 04:49:26,320
See?

6809
04:49:26,480 --> 04:49:27,400
I unlocked the shortcut.

6810
04:49:27,580 --> 04:49:28,620
That means I'm coming back.

6811
04:49:36,850 --> 04:49:37,970
Guys, I unlocked the shortcut.

6812
04:49:38,070 --> 04:49:38,850
I'm gonna come back, guys.

6813
04:49:38,890 --> 04:49:39,230
Don't worry.

6814
04:49:43,610 --> 04:49:44,370
Don't worry, guys.

6815
04:49:44,690 --> 04:49:45,210
Don't worry.

6816
04:49:45,770 --> 04:49:46,330
We'll be back.

6817
04:49:52,390 --> 04:49:54,450
I... We work well together, guys.

6818
04:49:57,250 --> 04:49:57,730
Right?

6819
04:49:58,390 --> 04:49:59,170
Fun fact.

6820
04:49:59,250 --> 04:50:05,610
You could have sped the process up by throwing grenades at the wall to weaken it for Ashley so it would break later.

6821
04:50:05,670 --> 04:50:06,430
That works?

6822
04:50:07,230 --> 04:50:08,090
Well, either way.

6823
04:50:08,930 --> 04:50:10,150
Snow, thank you for the super chat.

6824
04:50:10,210 --> 04:50:10,490
Thank you.

6825
04:50:10,670 --> 04:50:10,990
Thank you.

6826
04:50:11,790 --> 04:50:12,610
You're no fun.

6827
04:50:15,530 --> 04:50:16,170
All right.

6828
04:50:17,050 --> 04:50:17,670
It's okay.

6829
04:50:17,970 --> 04:50:20,970
We'll come back at part four of the game.

6830
04:50:20,990 --> 04:50:21,610
Play, guys.

6831
04:50:22,130 --> 04:50:22,830
Don't worry.

6832
04:50:22,930 --> 04:50:23,250
We'll come.

6833
04:50:25,990 --> 04:50:30,090
Guys, in part four of Resident Evil 4, we'll come back, chat.

6834
04:50:33,130 --> 04:50:36,090
And then... do this.

6835
04:50:36,930 --> 04:50:38,230
Then we get out of here.

6836
04:50:42,630 --> 04:50:44,050
Oh, thank god.

6837
04:50:45,150 --> 04:50:47,230
I fucking hate her so much.

6838
04:50:48,570 --> 04:50:52,530
I must stress the use of extreme caution when playing Resident Evil 4.

6839
04:50:52,550 --> 04:50:58,130
When handling the amber deposits from underneath the castle, work with the utmost respect and obedience.

6840
04:50:59,430 --> 04:51:03,510
It is imperative that you do not disturb the holy body's slumber.

6841
04:51:07,550 --> 04:51:08,190
Okay.

6842
04:51:09,450 --> 04:51:10,330
Wait, what?

6843
04:51:11,270 --> 04:51:12,770
Not the amber right there?

6844
04:51:14,010 --> 04:51:16,150
This must be what Luis was talking about.

6845
04:51:16,390 --> 04:51:17,390
Yeah, this is the deposit.

6846
04:51:17,510 --> 04:51:18,090
The rock.

6847
04:51:18,890 --> 04:51:19,850
It's the rock!

6848
04:51:22,970 --> 04:51:24,630
See, John Cena's better.

6849
04:51:25,730 --> 04:51:27,750
Oh, there's a yellow herb.

6850
04:51:27,830 --> 04:51:28,350
I need that.

6851
04:51:31,870 --> 04:51:33,070
Let's see.

6852
04:51:33,490 --> 04:51:35,250
We just need a red herb.

6853
04:51:40,410 --> 04:51:42,850
Okay, I'm just making sure I loot everything.

6854
04:51:46,630 --> 04:51:47,770
Anything back here?

6855
04:51:47,950 --> 04:51:48,690
What's back here?

6856
04:51:49,270 --> 04:51:54,290
Dearest Lord Saddler, I am overjoyed to report wonderful news.

6857
04:52:04,410 --> 04:52:07,450
The Plague is a truly magnificent organism.

6858
04:52:07,770 --> 04:52:14,090
It has the capacity to live in any vertebrate, be it a human, dog, or even crow.

6859
04:52:14,430 --> 04:52:16,870
There are no other parasites like it on Earth.

6860
04:52:17,070 --> 04:52:24,690
The superior species is particularly impressive, as it can assimilate with a host without causing any damage to the brain.

6861
04:52:25,130 --> 04:52:28,770
No one can oppose the strength of your dominance, my lord.

6862
04:52:28,990 --> 04:52:35,790
On the contrary, who will resist one's experience of the other joy that accompanies the absence of free will?

6863
04:52:36,030 --> 04:52:39,770
I am living proof how ignorant I once was.

6864
04:52:40,130 --> 04:52:48,230
In a few days, I will have finished administrating the Plague to all the high-ranking researchers, and then they too shall know.

6865
04:52:49,270 --> 04:52:53,270
And when your plan is complete, the whole world shall know!

6866
04:52:53,470 --> 04:52:54,490
Oh, it's Annabelle!

6867
04:52:54,770 --> 04:52:56,430
The girl that stops smiling!

6868
04:52:58,970 --> 04:53:00,710
She's the one that stops smiling.

6869
04:53:04,750 --> 04:53:06,050
Alright, this is it.

6870
04:53:06,170 --> 04:53:07,930
Oh, yeah, that's a lot of parasites.

6871
04:53:09,870 --> 04:53:10,810
There they are.

6872
04:53:11,550 --> 04:53:13,390
That's what's inside you, Ashley.

6873
04:53:20,490 --> 04:53:23,070
I wonder if that's Annabelle, the one to the left.

6874
04:53:23,930 --> 04:53:26,230
Such a profound blessing for all.

6875
04:53:27,790 --> 04:53:29,130
Oh, Splatter.

6876
04:53:32,830 --> 04:53:33,590
Welcome.

6877
04:53:33,910 --> 04:53:35,650
Oh my god!

6878
04:53:38,390 --> 04:53:39,430
He's like...

6879
04:53:39,430 --> 04:53:43,390
I am Osman Sadler, the speaker for our lord.

6880
04:53:43,770 --> 04:53:45,310
Tell someone who gives a shit.

6881
04:53:46,490 --> 04:53:47,250
Oh!

6882
04:53:48,450 --> 04:53:49,890
Foolish lambs.

6883
04:53:49,890 --> 04:53:52,570
Why do you deny grief?

6884
04:53:53,130 --> 04:53:53,470
Oh!

6885
04:53:55,630 --> 04:53:57,490
Oh my god, he heals so fast.

6886
04:53:57,930 --> 04:53:59,350
Now, abandon your body.

6887
04:54:00,290 --> 04:54:01,010
Obey.

6888
04:54:01,650 --> 04:54:03,750
Obey the voice of our lord.

6889
04:54:08,470 --> 04:54:09,190
No!

6890
04:54:10,070 --> 04:54:10,790
No!

6891
04:54:11,450 --> 04:54:12,170
Oh!

6892
04:54:13,590 --> 04:54:15,370
Don't worry, I'll heal just like him.

6893
04:54:17,110 --> 04:54:17,830
Do

6894
04:54:25,440 --> 04:54:26,640
not resist.

6895
04:54:31,280 --> 04:54:32,720
Ashley, your aim!

6896
04:54:33,060 --> 04:54:35,960
What the fuck is going on over there?

6897
04:54:40,400 --> 04:54:41,820
No ammo.

6898
04:54:43,520 --> 04:54:45,480
Pray forgive these wicked sinners.

6899
04:54:46,080 --> 04:54:49,460
My faithful disciples shall deliver to you your...

6900
04:54:50,060 --> 04:54:50,680
Penance.

6901
04:54:52,000 --> 04:54:53,000
Now, child.

6902
04:54:53,460 --> 04:54:55,240
You need not be afraid.

6903
04:54:56,180 --> 04:55:00,200
Submit your body and release yourself from fear.

6904
04:55:04,750 --> 04:55:05,730
Why not me?

6905
04:55:05,890 --> 04:55:07,130
Do I have the dumber one?

6906
04:55:07,410 --> 04:55:08,670
Do I have the dumb...

6907
04:55:08,670 --> 04:55:10,290
The dumb parasite?

6908
04:55:10,810 --> 04:55:12,010
I can't tell.

6909
04:55:16,470 --> 04:55:20,450
I can't tell if I have the dumb parasite or the smart one.

6910
04:55:27,640 --> 04:55:30,180
We got the Leon parasite.

6911
04:55:30,180 --> 04:55:33,520
I like

6912
04:55:37,860 --> 04:55:39,040
how they just left me.

6913
04:55:39,680 --> 04:55:41,340
Like, why don't they just...

6914
04:55:41,340 --> 04:55:42,100
They could have...

6915
04:55:42,100 --> 04:55:44,060
He could have personally killed me.

6916
04:55:44,980 --> 04:55:47,460
Like, why did they leave me?

6917
04:55:48,180 --> 04:55:50,860
Why don't you like personally do it?

6918
04:55:56,010 --> 04:55:57,310
Wait, is that the...

6919
04:55:57,310 --> 04:55:58,050
What is that?

6920
04:55:58,070 --> 04:55:59,070
Oh, that's just the normal one.

6921
04:56:01,650 --> 04:56:02,730
Turn around.

6922
04:56:03,170 --> 04:56:04,130
Turn around.

6923
04:56:04,350 --> 04:56:04,570
Turn around.

6924
04:56:05,110 --> 04:56:05,390
Turn around.

6925
04:56:05,810 --> 04:56:07,030
Turn around.

6926
04:56:07,790 --> 04:56:09,070
Turn around.

6927
04:56:09,850 --> 04:56:10,730
Alright, here we go.

6928
04:56:16,830 --> 04:56:18,150
Wait, was that people?

6929
04:56:18,350 --> 04:56:19,770
Oh, what the fuck?

6930
04:56:19,850 --> 04:56:20,110
Ow!

6931
04:56:22,150 --> 04:56:22,910
Oh shit.

6932
04:56:23,030 --> 04:56:23,510
Wait.

6933
04:56:23,610 --> 04:56:24,890
How is he gonna come up?

6934
04:56:25,070 --> 04:56:25,910
Oh, the ladder.

6935
04:56:29,830 --> 04:56:30,330
Nice.

6936
04:56:31,090 --> 04:56:32,410
Come on, come up the ladder.

6937
04:56:33,870 --> 04:56:34,950
That's fucking right.

6938
04:56:36,510 --> 04:56:37,850
My ladder, bitch.

6939
04:56:38,650 --> 04:56:39,890
Come on, climb up.

6940
04:56:41,370 --> 04:56:42,650
Oh, there we go.

6941
04:56:43,050 --> 04:56:45,070
I'm just making sure there's nobody behind me.

6942
04:56:45,530 --> 04:56:46,950
Come on, come up the ladder.

6943
04:56:47,170 --> 04:56:48,390
That's fucking right.

6944
04:56:48,650 --> 04:56:50,110
Wait, how do you headshot this?

6945
04:56:50,290 --> 04:56:51,090
Oh no.

6946
04:56:51,330 --> 04:56:52,110
Oh no.

6947
04:56:55,210 --> 04:56:57,110
Come on, come up the ladder.

6948
04:57:02,110 --> 04:57:03,390
That's fucking right.

6949
04:57:04,650 --> 04:57:05,490
I forgot.

6950
04:57:05,630 --> 04:57:07,270
I just need a stab.

6951
04:57:08,210 --> 04:57:09,870
I don't have to worry about it.

6952
04:57:09,890 --> 04:57:13,650
I don't have to worry about fucking shooting him.

6953
04:57:13,790 --> 04:57:15,050
He's on the ladder.

6954
04:57:16,890 --> 04:57:18,730
Alright, nice gunpowder.

6955
04:57:19,490 --> 04:57:23,650
Per your request, redevelopment of the island is well underway.

6956
04:57:24,330 --> 04:57:29,170
Weapons and other defensive equipment have been set up to guard against any outside intruders.

6957
04:57:29,530 --> 04:57:32,990
By the time we are finished, the island will be a giant fortress.

6958
04:57:33,530 --> 04:57:38,610
These defenses won't hold up long term, but they should last until we carry out our plan.

6959
04:57:38,610 --> 04:57:43,930
And once accomplished, we'll be that much closer to our ultimate goal of world domination.

6960
04:57:44,490 --> 04:57:46,990
None will be able to resist our power.

6961
04:57:47,210 --> 04:57:51,410
Except for me, because of my thick thighs.

6962
04:57:55,390 --> 04:57:58,650
With the power of my thighs, I shall resist you.

6963
04:58:00,850 --> 04:58:02,730
Good that I'm getting ammo though.

6964
04:58:03,590 --> 04:58:06,390
Holy shit, because by god, I need ammo.

6965
04:58:07,770 --> 04:58:08,410
Desperately.

6966
04:58:11,910 --> 04:58:13,030
Nice gold bar.

6967
04:58:13,250 --> 04:58:13,770
Money!

6968
04:58:14,870 --> 04:58:15,390
Money!

6969
04:58:17,910 --> 04:58:19,870
There's so much loot here, I don't like that.

6970
04:58:22,530 --> 04:58:26,250
I do not like the fact that I am getting so much loot.

6971
04:58:27,530 --> 04:58:29,170
Doesn't make me feel good.

6972
04:58:30,110 --> 04:58:31,270
Is there anybody here?

6973
04:58:32,190 --> 04:58:33,790
Is there anybody in the P corner?

6974
04:58:37,470 --> 04:58:38,910
No one at the P corner?

6975
04:58:39,170 --> 04:58:39,510
Okay.

6976
04:58:40,770 --> 04:58:41,770
That's good to know.

6977
04:58:42,890 --> 04:58:45,530
That's good to know, no one's going to the bathroom in the caves.

6978
04:58:47,170 --> 04:58:47,690
Alright.

6979
04:58:48,690 --> 04:58:49,990
Down we go.

6980
04:58:52,650 --> 04:58:53,390
This way.

6981
04:58:54,050 --> 04:58:54,570
Loot!

6982
04:58:55,490 --> 04:58:56,010
Loot!

6983
04:58:56,990 --> 04:58:57,510
Loot!

6984
04:58:59,250 --> 04:59:01,750
I just want to make sure I have everything reloaded.

6985
04:59:05,510 --> 04:59:06,030
Oh.

6986
04:59:06,470 --> 04:59:07,510
Wait, are these soldiers?

6987
04:59:09,750 --> 04:59:10,950
Operation Javier.

6988
04:59:11,210 --> 04:59:16,470
Few people have heard the name, even within the highest ranks of the US government.

6989
04:59:17,630 --> 04:59:19,290
And little wonder too.

6990
04:59:19,490 --> 04:59:21,750
The operation was not made public.

6991
04:59:21,990 --> 04:59:24,430
It was conducted in secret and then buried.

6992
04:59:24,650 --> 04:59:27,910
The reason being, it was too inhumane.

6993
04:59:28,050 --> 04:59:30,230
Now let's start it back in 2002.

6994
04:59:30,590 --> 04:59:36,290
When a small unit of US Special Forces was sent to infiltrate an area of South America.

6995
04:59:36,290 --> 04:59:39,910
Their mission was to eradicate the drug cartels.

6996
04:59:39,970 --> 04:59:46,810
The whole operation took several years to prepare for and only the most elite soldiers were selected to participate.

6997
04:59:47,290 --> 04:59:49,430
Wait, why wasn't I selected to participate?

6998
04:59:49,690 --> 04:59:50,010
Leon?

6999
04:59:50,370 --> 04:59:51,690
Are you not elite enough?

7000
04:59:52,910 --> 04:59:56,210
I don't know if the mission was a failure or not.

7001
04:59:56,390 --> 05:00:00,330
But I do know the fate of those elite soldiers once it was over.

7002
05:00:00,850 --> 05:00:06,050
Apparently, the entire unit was wiped out except for the commanding officer.

7003
05:00:06,050 --> 05:00:07,070
Major blank.

7004
05:00:07,290 --> 05:00:09,990
And not by the cartels, but by the US.

7005
05:00:10,290 --> 05:00:11,110
Oh wait, that's the...

7006
05:00:11,110 --> 05:00:12,090
That's the...

7007
05:00:12,090 --> 05:00:13,330
That's that guy.

7008
05:00:13,570 --> 05:00:13,990
Knife guy.

7009
05:00:15,090 --> 05:00:16,030
Oh, I was...

7010
05:00:16,030 --> 05:00:16,530
This is me?

7011
05:00:17,150 --> 05:00:17,970
This is me?

7012
05:00:20,150 --> 05:00:21,550
I was part of that mission?

7013
05:00:21,870 --> 05:00:22,910
It's been 20 years.

7014
05:00:23,070 --> 05:00:23,570
I don't remember.

7015
05:00:24,170 --> 05:00:26,830
It should have been difficult to extract a single stranded unit.

7016
05:00:27,190 --> 05:00:29,490
All it would have taken was a single helicopter.

7017
05:00:29,830 --> 05:00:32,590
But for some reason, the military didn't act.

7018
05:00:34,170 --> 05:00:36,030
Rumors say that a decision was made.

7019
05:00:36,050 --> 05:00:39,390
What's the outcome of a power struggle among the top brass?

7020
05:00:39,650 --> 05:00:42,650
Others say it was a directive from the former president himself.

7021
05:00:43,130 --> 05:00:46,310
But we may never know the truth since it was all covered up.

7022
05:00:46,850 --> 05:00:48,350
But I'm certain of one thing.

7023
05:00:48,830 --> 05:00:51,110
The US government let those people die.

7024
05:00:51,730 --> 05:00:56,050
Brave young people who dedicated their lives to protect their country.

7025
05:00:56,430 --> 05:00:58,030
I want to expo...

7026
05:00:58,030 --> 05:00:59,230
Oh my god, he's a whistleblower!

7027
05:01:00,130 --> 05:01:00,730
He's...

7028
05:01:00,730 --> 05:01:02,410
That guy at WikiLeaks!

7029
05:01:02,570 --> 05:01:04,570
I want to expose this crime.

7030
05:01:04,570 --> 05:01:08,030
Not because it's my responsibility as a reporter.

7031
05:01:08,310 --> 05:01:11,530
Because it is my duty as a fellow American.

7032
05:01:11,790 --> 05:01:14,030
Check this out on WikiLeaks soon!

7033
05:01:15,310 --> 05:01:16,490
Note 1.

7034
05:01:16,730 --> 05:01:19,310
The document concerns Operation Javier.

7035
05:01:19,530 --> 05:01:22,950
And was written by an American journalist named...

7036
05:01:22,950 --> 05:01:23,850
Blank.

7037
05:01:24,470 --> 05:01:25,070
Uh...

7038
05:01:25,070 --> 05:01:27,410
Not WikiLeaks.

7039
05:01:27,710 --> 05:01:28,850
Oh my god.

7040
05:01:28,910 --> 05:01:30,570
This article will never be published.

7041
05:01:30,890 --> 05:01:32,830
Blank has already been taken care of.

7042
05:01:32,910 --> 05:01:33,190
No!

7043
05:01:33,330 --> 05:01:33,870
Thank god!

7044
05:01:33,870 --> 05:01:34,670
That's

7045
05:01:37,870 --> 05:01:38,030
me!

7046
05:01:38,190 --> 05:01:39,030
I'm waiting.

7047
05:01:39,190 --> 05:01:40,010
Jesus Christ.

7048
05:01:40,090 --> 05:01:40,530
What?

7049
05:01:44,050 --> 05:01:46,070
That's why WikiLeaks is gone!

7050
05:01:46,850 --> 05:01:47,570
Coincidence?

7051
05:01:50,830 --> 05:01:51,850
Phase 1.

7052
05:01:52,010 --> 05:01:53,970
Depart from campus because of...

7053
05:01:53,970 --> 05:01:58,230
It's because of Resident Evil that we don't have WikiLeaks anymore.

7054
05:02:01,410 --> 05:02:03,870
Depart from campus with the target.

7055
05:02:04,150 --> 05:02:05,270
Escort the car...

7056
05:02:05,270 --> 05:02:06,170
Ashley Grahams.

7057
05:02:06,170 --> 05:02:07,970
Oh, this is the abduction of the President's daughter.

7058
05:02:08,130 --> 05:02:10,290
Escort the target as usual until the start of Phase 2.

7059
05:02:10,510 --> 05:02:13,490
There should be three outside inside the vehicle, including Baker.

7060
05:02:14,830 --> 05:02:17,150
Abe's unit will follow behind you in a separate vehicle.

7061
05:02:17,330 --> 05:02:18,130
Continue to drive.

7062
05:02:18,510 --> 05:02:19,990
Who cares about...

7063
05:02:19,990 --> 05:02:21,150
She's already kidnapped!

7064
05:02:21,250 --> 05:02:23,030
Do we really need to know this information?

7065
05:02:23,710 --> 05:02:24,510
We already...

7066
05:02:24,510 --> 05:02:24,830
Whoa!

7067
05:02:26,230 --> 05:02:27,590
Whose blood is that?

7068
05:02:29,550 --> 05:02:30,930
Mr. WikiLeaks?

7069
05:02:32,310 --> 05:02:33,330
Is that your blood?

7070
05:02:36,250 --> 05:02:37,470
Look alive.

7071
05:02:38,890 --> 05:02:40,510
Where did the crow go?

7072
05:02:40,970 --> 05:02:41,390
Shit!

7073
05:02:41,750 --> 05:02:42,210
No!

7074
05:02:42,750 --> 05:02:43,590
My...

7075
05:02:43,590 --> 05:02:44,470
My loot!

7076
05:02:50,210 --> 05:02:52,350
My crow loot!

7077
05:02:56,110 --> 05:02:56,950
Okay.

7078
05:02:57,210 --> 05:02:58,390
Oh no!

7079
05:03:05,670 --> 05:03:07,150
Yeah, I shot a crow.

7080
05:03:08,170 --> 05:03:09,730
Why the crow?

7081
05:03:10,130 --> 05:03:11,370
Because he owes me money!

7082
05:03:13,210 --> 05:03:13,730
That's why.

7083
05:03:14,450 --> 05:03:15,710
What can I do you for?

7084
05:03:15,710 --> 05:03:17,910
Okay, we gotta set up this and then these two.

7085
05:03:18,310 --> 05:03:18,450
Ah.

7086
05:03:19,090 --> 05:03:19,790
All right.

7087
05:03:19,830 --> 05:03:22,250
Do we have enough to...

7088
05:03:22,250 --> 05:03:24,870
Okay, we gotta repair and then we gotta repair this.

7089
05:03:26,030 --> 05:03:26,550
Uh...

7090
05:03:27,070 --> 05:03:28,030
Let's see.

7091
05:03:28,590 --> 05:03:31,210
We might as well upgrade our riot...

7092
05:03:31,210 --> 05:03:32,310
Oh wait, actually...

7093
05:03:33,870 --> 05:03:36,670
We might as well upgrade our shotgun now.

7094
05:03:38,170 --> 05:03:38,690
You'll...

7095
05:03:38,690 --> 05:03:39,890
There you go.

7096
05:03:39,890 --> 05:03:40,590
We'll just have to wait for this anyway.

7097
05:03:42,650 --> 05:03:43,630
There you go.

7098
05:03:44,170 --> 05:03:45,310
All right, I'm broke now.

7099
05:03:46,870 --> 05:03:47,730
I'm broke.

7100
05:03:48,010 --> 05:03:48,750
All right.

7101
05:03:49,110 --> 05:03:49,690
Nice.

7102
05:03:50,650 --> 05:03:52,510
There's another message at the tent?

7103
05:03:52,750 --> 05:03:54,430
I missed out more lore?

7104
05:03:54,990 --> 05:03:55,570
No.

7105
05:03:55,730 --> 05:03:57,270
Think about the lore, guys.

7106
05:03:57,990 --> 05:04:00,990
Won't somebody think about the fucking lore?

7107
05:04:02,770 --> 05:04:03,350
This?

7108
05:04:03,510 --> 05:04:04,150
Oh, there it is.

7109
05:04:13,390 --> 05:04:14,290
Just us?

7110
05:04:26,310 --> 05:04:27,250
Oh my god.

7111
05:04:27,490 --> 05:04:30,250
It's so nice of him to tell me to get ready for battle.

7112
05:04:30,950 --> 05:04:35,210
I know like other soldiers will think about like, you know, the ambush.

7113
05:04:35,490 --> 05:04:37,890
But I'm glad that he like prepped me for this.

7114
05:04:39,450 --> 05:04:40,770
We're at Save 100!

7115
05:04:43,070 --> 05:04:44,110
Our milestone!

7116
05:04:48,110 --> 05:04:48,630
Yeah!

7117
05:04:49,510 --> 05:04:51,250
Let's celebrate, everybody!

7118
05:04:51,650 --> 05:04:52,170
Congratulations!

7119
05:04:53,170 --> 05:04:54,470
On 100 years!

7120
05:04:54,470 --> 05:04:54,830
100 saves!

7121
05:04:56,990 --> 05:04:57,510
Yay!

7122
05:04:59,330 --> 05:05:00,530
We did it!

7123
05:05:03,410 --> 05:05:05,690
We fucking did it, guys!

7124
05:05:09,190 --> 05:05:09,710
Celebrate!

7125
05:05:09,710 --> 05:05:10,930
It's like for a birthday!

7126
05:05:11,070 --> 05:05:13,150
But better because it's 100 birthdays!

7127
05:05:16,910 --> 05:05:18,830
I swear to God, are we gonna knife again?

7128
05:05:19,010 --> 05:05:20,370
I repaired my knife this time.

7129
05:05:24,470 --> 05:05:26,230
Couldn't have done it without you, Dragoons!

7130
05:05:27,330 --> 05:05:28,650
Is that your blood?

7131
05:05:29,290 --> 05:05:31,470
Bro, I think you need a blood transfusion.

7132
05:05:54,470 --> 05:05:55,670
You think they would want that?

7133
05:05:56,630 --> 05:05:57,110
Revenge.

7134
05:05:57,690 --> 05:06:01,570
You think I'm doing all this for revenge?

7135
05:06:02,310 --> 05:06:03,770
Isn't that what this is all about?

7136
05:06:03,930 --> 05:06:04,630
Yeah, what's this about?

7137
05:06:04,870 --> 05:06:08,370
You see, in that jungle, I had a revelation.

7138
05:06:09,470 --> 05:06:16,370
The most important thing in this world is pure, unadulterated power.

7139
05:06:17,910 --> 05:06:19,630
Those Illuminados have given me that.

7140
05:06:20,470 --> 05:06:21,990
You know you were always an asshole.

7141
05:06:23,150 --> 05:06:25,250
But at least you had some kind of code.

7142
05:06:25,950 --> 05:06:27,090
Some honor.

7143
05:06:27,170 --> 05:06:29,630
There's no honor in power and money.

7144
05:06:29,950 --> 05:06:30,610
Look at you now.

7145
05:06:32,250 --> 05:06:33,530
Enough reminiscing.

7146
05:06:35,190 --> 05:06:37,570
Move out and draw fire, soldier!

7147
05:06:39,070 --> 05:06:39,550
Damn!

7148
05:06:40,410 --> 05:06:41,770
Bro, he has a gun now?

7149
05:06:42,690 --> 05:06:44,790
Bro, what would be quite being a knife fight?

7150
05:06:47,070 --> 05:06:48,410
Why did I just do this?

7151
05:06:49,410 --> 05:06:50,790
Did I just shoot him?

7152
05:06:51,990 --> 05:06:52,770
Guys, will I?

7153
05:06:54,770 --> 05:06:55,590
That's what's wrong.

7154
05:06:58,010 --> 05:06:59,530
Woah, he's so fast!

7155
05:07:00,910 --> 05:07:04,240
Shake me!

7156
05:07:06,180 --> 05:07:06,840
Bro!

7157
05:07:12,670 --> 05:07:14,210
Bro, he's special ops!

7158
05:07:17,650 --> 05:07:22,250
Oh, his shiny combo means so hard!

7159
05:07:22,770 --> 05:07:23,750
Where did he go?

7160
05:07:24,690 --> 05:07:26,150
Where the fuck did he go?

7161
05:07:27,610 --> 05:07:28,250
He's gone!

7162
05:07:31,770 --> 05:07:35,590
Bro, he fucking... Bro, he shaked me so fucking hard, bro!

7163
05:07:36,830 --> 05:07:38,970
Bro, that shit was scary.

7164
05:07:40,770 --> 05:07:41,750
Oh, he's weak?

7165
05:07:41,810 --> 05:07:42,610
Of course he is.

7166
05:07:42,710 --> 05:07:44,190
Of course he's weak to the knife.

7167
05:07:48,190 --> 05:07:48,670
Alright.

7168
05:07:48,670 --> 05:07:49,150
Alright.

7169
05:07:50,670 --> 05:07:51,670
Get up here.

7170
05:07:52,590 --> 05:07:53,510
Oh, I got a beetle.

7171
05:07:53,510 --> 05:07:58,390
Okay, I wasn't... I didn't mean to, but I got a beetle now.

7172
05:07:59,590 --> 05:08:00,970
I'm gonna sell that for money.

7173
05:08:02,070 --> 05:08:03,090
Oh, wait, where do I go?

7174
05:08:03,370 --> 05:08:04,910
He gave me the London treatment.

7175
05:08:05,010 --> 05:08:05,610
He sure did.

7176
05:08:07,450 --> 05:08:08,630
I guess I'll go this way.

7177
05:08:09,930 --> 05:08:10,330
Right?

7178
05:08:12,050 --> 05:08:13,410
Is this where I came from?

7179
05:08:13,870 --> 05:08:15,090
No, this is where I go.

7180
05:08:15,910 --> 05:08:17,250
How do I get lost already?

7181
05:08:19,810 --> 05:08:20,210
Guys...

7182
05:08:21,530 --> 05:08:23,170
How am I already lost?

7183
05:08:26,770 --> 05:08:27,850
Alright, let's see.

7184
05:08:29,670 --> 05:08:31,290
I'm gonna sell this beetle.

7185
05:08:31,630 --> 05:08:34,510
He became satisfied after stabbing you a few times.

7186
05:08:34,750 --> 05:08:35,250
Fight over.

7187
05:08:35,470 --> 05:08:36,790
Thank you for the super chat.

7188
05:08:36,910 --> 05:08:37,210
Thank you.

7189
05:08:37,250 --> 05:08:37,710
Thank you.

7190
05:08:38,290 --> 05:08:38,950
Let's see.

7191
05:08:39,050 --> 05:08:40,230
I'm going to...

7192
05:08:41,150 --> 05:08:41,730
I don't know.

7193
05:08:41,750 --> 05:08:42,250
I have a fish.

7194
05:08:42,350 --> 05:08:43,430
I might as well just eat the fish.

7195
05:08:43,650 --> 05:08:45,430
Like, what am I gonna do with this fish anyway?

7196
05:08:46,210 --> 05:08:47,910
Like, this fish is just there.

7197
05:08:49,830 --> 05:08:50,610
Wouldn't you sell?

7198
05:08:50,710 --> 05:08:51,670
Yeah, I'd rather sell it.

7199
05:08:51,730 --> 05:08:52,210
It's 10k.

7200
05:08:53,210 --> 05:08:54,650
It's an easy 10k.

7201
05:08:58,550 --> 05:08:58,990
Alright.

7202
05:08:59,230 --> 05:08:59,850
Right there.

7203
05:09:00,570 --> 05:09:03,610
I know the beetle raises my max HP, but look at...

7204
05:09:03,610 --> 05:09:07,070
Okay, I know you guys can't see my HP, but like...

7205
05:09:07,070 --> 05:09:07,430
Okay, wait.

7206
05:09:08,150 --> 05:09:09,590
God, I can't get out of...

7207
05:09:12,770 --> 05:09:15,550
I'll just let you know, my HP is practically max.

7208
05:09:15,870 --> 05:09:22,590
I like, basically have max HP, guys.

7209
05:09:22,590 --> 05:09:24,610
You barely made it out alive.

7210
05:09:25,790 --> 05:09:26,930
Wait, how do I...

7211
05:09:26,930 --> 05:09:27,410
Don't think.

7212
05:09:27,950 --> 05:09:29,590
That was the first thing you taught me.

7213
05:09:30,130 --> 05:09:30,610
Alright.

7214
05:09:31,970 --> 05:09:32,450
Nice.

7215
05:09:32,530 --> 05:09:33,110
We did it.

7216
05:09:34,590 --> 05:09:36,370
He's turned this place into one big trap.

7217
05:09:36,870 --> 05:09:38,550
I can't fight him on his terms.

7218
05:09:38,670 --> 05:09:39,250
What the fuck?

7219
05:09:41,650 --> 05:09:42,310
I'm scared.

7220
05:09:42,810 --> 05:09:43,290
What?

7221
05:09:43,790 --> 05:09:45,770
What the fucking fucking baby?

7222
05:09:46,670 --> 05:09:47,150
Bro!

7223
05:09:47,830 --> 05:09:48,170
Oh.

7224
05:09:49,670 --> 05:09:50,150
Bro.

7225
05:09:50,970 --> 05:09:51,610
Bro.

7226
05:09:51,850 --> 05:09:52,810
How the...

7227
05:09:52,810 --> 05:09:53,390
Fuck!

7228
05:09:53,630 --> 05:09:54,450
I'm sorry.

7229
05:09:55,490 --> 05:09:56,970
How did he know?

7230
05:09:57,130 --> 05:09:59,130
I thought I was short enough.

7231
05:09:59,370 --> 05:10:00,450
That was my bad.

7232
05:10:02,030 --> 05:10:04,450
I actually thought I was short enough.

7233
05:10:07,510 --> 05:10:09,710
Ready to die, rookie.

7234
05:10:10,590 --> 05:10:11,230
What?

7235
05:10:15,010 --> 05:10:17,030
Bro, I hate this man.

7236
05:10:17,030 --> 05:10:19,790
Oh my god, bro.

7237
05:10:19,970 --> 05:10:21,030
I'm coming!

7238
05:10:21,110 --> 05:10:21,730
Why?

7239
05:10:23,790 --> 05:10:26,290
Now there's bear traps?

7240
05:10:27,030 --> 05:10:28,030
Okay.

7241
05:10:28,890 --> 05:10:29,390
How?

7242
05:10:31,830 --> 05:10:33,590
Oh my god.

7243
05:10:36,910 --> 05:10:37,990
Holy shit.

7244
05:10:38,810 --> 05:10:40,410
Oh my god.

7245
05:10:43,810 --> 05:10:44,810
Okay.

7246
05:10:45,210 --> 05:10:46,910
Okay, I hate this.

7247
05:10:46,910 --> 05:10:50,290
I hate this so fucking much.

7248
05:10:51,290 --> 05:10:54,110
I hate this so fucking much.

7249
05:10:57,010 --> 05:10:58,390
Almost got me.

7250
05:10:59,990 --> 05:11:01,750
You almost got me!

7251
05:11:06,450 --> 05:11:07,010
Okay.

7252
05:11:08,150 --> 05:11:09,450
Just so close.

7253
05:11:09,730 --> 05:11:10,490
I wonder if I can...

7254
05:11:10,490 --> 05:11:11,310
Like, if I shoot here...

7255
05:11:11,310 --> 05:11:12,070
Oh, no, it doesn't.

7256
05:11:12,890 --> 05:11:14,410
Holy fuck, bro.

7257
05:11:14,450 --> 05:11:14,950
I hate...

7258
05:11:14,950 --> 05:11:15,810
I hate this guy.

7259
05:11:16,030 --> 05:11:16,910
I hate him.

7260
05:11:17,150 --> 05:11:17,790
I hate him.

7261
05:11:19,830 --> 05:11:21,270
Holy shit.

7262
05:11:22,710 --> 05:11:24,610
This guy fucking sucks, man.

7263
05:11:25,530 --> 05:11:29,070
I'm no stranger to covert tactics, remember?

7264
05:11:29,810 --> 05:11:30,530
Where?

7265
05:11:30,750 --> 05:11:31,330
How could I forget?

7266
05:11:31,530 --> 05:11:32,150
Shit.

7267
05:11:33,130 --> 05:11:34,850
How could I forget?

7268
05:11:35,090 --> 05:11:35,750
Shit.

7269
05:11:40,360 --> 05:11:41,080
Where?

7270
05:11:42,120 --> 05:11:42,840
Where?

7271
05:11:45,520 --> 05:11:46,240
Okay.

7272
05:11:47,320 --> 05:11:48,040
There.

7273
05:11:48,820 --> 05:11:49,540
Alright.

7274
05:11:50,060 --> 05:11:51,060
Oh, shit.

7275
05:11:51,080 --> 05:11:51,260
Okay.

7276
05:11:53,480 --> 05:11:54,380
There we go.

7277
05:11:55,520 --> 05:11:56,940
Oh my god.

7278
05:12:00,740 --> 05:12:01,220
Bro.

7279
05:12:02,100 --> 05:12:03,400
Bro, I hate his love.

7280
05:12:03,500 --> 05:12:05,660
Bro, what the fuck is this boss fight, bro?

7281
05:12:06,760 --> 05:12:09,200
Oh, shit!

7282
05:12:09,360 --> 05:12:09,780
He missed!

7283
05:12:10,380 --> 05:12:11,100
He missed!

7284
05:12:13,800 --> 05:12:14,720
Joke's on you!

7285
05:12:19,550 --> 05:12:21,330
I swear to god, if there's a trap...

7286
05:12:21,330 --> 05:12:22,530
I swear to god, man.

7287
05:12:23,570 --> 05:12:25,310
I'm so paranoid now.

7288
05:12:27,030 --> 05:12:28,090
I'm actually...

7289
05:12:28,090 --> 05:12:29,630
I'm so fucking paranoid.

7290
05:12:29,650 --> 05:12:30,790
I swear to god.

7291
05:12:33,510 --> 05:12:34,770
Holy shit.

7292
05:12:34,790 --> 05:12:37,030
I'm so fucking paranoid over this guy.

7293
05:12:37,450 --> 05:12:39,310
I hate him so much.

7294
05:12:39,510 --> 05:12:40,510
Alright, nice.

7295
05:12:41,470 --> 05:12:42,130
Oh!

7296
05:12:46,410 --> 05:12:47,730
The paranoia.

7297
05:12:48,230 --> 05:12:49,530
It's kicking in.

7298
05:12:51,450 --> 05:12:53,170
It's fucking kicking in.

7299
05:13:03,300 --> 05:13:04,220
Where are you?

7300
05:13:05,860 --> 05:13:07,300
Where are you?

7301
05:13:07,300 --> 05:13:07,680
Where are you?!

7302
05:13:10,930 --> 05:13:11,870
Fucking right.

7303
05:13:20,770 --> 05:13:21,810
Holy shit.

7304
05:13:22,490 --> 05:13:23,010
Okay.

7305
05:13:27,050 --> 05:13:27,830
There, yes.

7306
05:13:31,270 --> 05:13:32,410
Where is he?

7307
05:13:34,390 --> 05:13:35,270
Where is he?

7308
05:13:36,490 --> 05:13:37,510
Where is he?

7309
05:13:38,390 --> 05:13:39,570
I don't like it!

7310
05:13:39,590 --> 05:13:40,790
I don't know where he is!

7311
05:13:40,970 --> 05:13:41,230
Where is he?

7312
05:13:45,370 --> 05:13:47,390
I don't know where he is!

7313
05:13:48,570 --> 05:13:49,530
I don't know where he is!

7314
05:13:49,530 --> 05:13:51,410
Okay, this is a mess right now.

7315
05:13:51,470 --> 05:13:53,190
This is a fucking mess right now.

7316
05:13:57,190 --> 05:13:59,030
Okay, I slowly move up.

7317
05:14:00,410 --> 05:14:01,870
I slowly move up.

7318
05:14:01,950 --> 05:14:04,050
Did I shoot him so he doesn't show up anymore?

7319
05:14:04,430 --> 05:14:05,370
Is that it?

7320
05:14:05,630 --> 05:14:06,430
Oh, I did!

7321
05:14:06,730 --> 05:14:07,430
I did!

7322
05:14:08,990 --> 05:14:11,130
You fucking... Fuck you!

7323
05:14:13,070 --> 05:14:14,190
Fuck you!

7324
05:14:14,450 --> 05:14:17,550
My fucking... Oh my god.

7325
05:14:19,630 --> 05:14:21,070
Okay, do I have more fish?

7326
05:14:21,350 --> 05:14:22,730
I don't have any more fish.

7327
05:14:22,810 --> 05:14:23,150
It's okay.

7328
05:14:23,790 --> 05:14:24,570
It's okay.

7329
05:14:28,030 --> 05:14:28,770
I'm ready.

7330
05:14:29,290 --> 05:14:30,310
I'm fucking ready.

7331
05:14:31,290 --> 05:14:32,430
I'm so ready.

7332
05:14:33,030 --> 05:14:33,590
Alright.

7333
05:14:34,170 --> 05:14:37,330
We're gonna... We're gonna... You know what?

7334
05:14:38,550 --> 05:14:39,590
I'm gonna eat this.

7335
05:14:39,730 --> 05:14:40,690
I don't need this.

7336
05:14:41,050 --> 05:14:41,930
I'm ready.

7337
05:14:42,190 --> 05:14:44,090
I am so ready.

7338
05:14:44,670 --> 05:14:46,930
What is shooting me?!

7339
05:14:51,880 --> 05:14:52,960
Oh god.

7340
05:14:53,100 --> 05:14:54,580
Bro, I'm fucking coming over here.

7341
05:14:55,640 --> 05:14:57,160
Oh my... Bro!

7342
05:14:58,440 --> 05:14:59,120

7343
05:15:00,260 --> 05:15:01,740

7345
05:15:04,100 --> 05:15:04,920

I am not better.

7355
05:15:20,660 --> 05:15:21,780
I am not better.

7356
05:15:21,920 --> 05:15:23,200
You are a major.

7357
05:15:25,400 --> 05:15:30,960
Oh, that's fucking... That's right!

7358
05:15:31,000 --> 05:15:31,220
Yes!

05:16:24,080 --> 05:16:24,840
Hahaha!

I swear I pressed ctrl.

7393
05:16:27,760 --> 05:16:30,240
I swear to god I pressed ctrl.

7394
05:16:31,300 --> 05:16:33,020
Oh my god.

7395
05:16:33,500 --> 05:16:36,900

05:16:50,920 --> 05:16:51,520
Why?

7403
05:16:52,400 --> 05:16:53,020
Why?!

7404
05:16:57,570 --> 05:16:58,450
Oh god.

7405
05:16:58,590 --> 05:16:59,350
Bro, fuck this.

7406
05:16:59,670 --> 05:17:00,830
Bro, where is he?

7407
05:17:11,430 --> 05:17:11,990
No!

7408
05:17:12,130 --> 05:17:15,190
Is he like getting rid of his power?

7409
05:17:15,330 --> 05:17:16,070
Oh my god!

7410
05:17:17,710 --> 05:17:18,750
It's like Naruto!

7411
05:17:19,310 --> 05:17:21,610
He took off his shirt and got stronger!

7412
05:17:25,710 --> 05:17:27,530
He took his hat off!

7413
05:17:27,530 --> 05:17:28,190
He's serious!

7414
05:17:28,450 --> 05:17:29,870
He's releasing his limiters!

7415
05:17:32,830 --> 05:17:33,950
Space 2?!

7416
05:17:35,330 --> 05:17:35,890
Yes!

7417
05:17:38,150 --> 05:17:38,870
Look at you!

7418
05:17:39,710 --> 05:17:40,790
Look at me!

7419
05:17:41,810 --> 05:17:44,890
I'm like... the only thing thick is my thighs!

7420
05:17:49,480 --> 05:17:51,270
I need a bigger knife.

7421
05:17:52,010 --> 05:17:54,930
I'm loving this episode of Tom and Jerry T.

7422
05:17:54,950 --> 05:17:55,750
Thank you for the super chat.

7423
05:17:55,850 --> 05:17:56,550
Thank you, thank you.

7424
05:17:59,050 --> 05:17:59,630
What?

7425
05:18:00,690 --> 05:18:02,110
What does that mean?

7426
05:18:05,290 --> 05:18:06,290
What does...

7427
05:18:06,290 --> 05:18:08,650
You're crazy.

7428
05:18:09,710 --> 05:18:11,110
You're fucking crazy now.

7429
05:18:13,250 --> 05:18:14,750
Oh my god.

7430
05:18:17,890 --> 05:18:21,370
Do I hurt him?

7431
05:18:22,430 --> 05:18:24,030
So that's your true power?

7432
05:18:24,890 --> 05:18:27,250
I can't tell if I hurt him!

7433
05:18:27,970 --> 05:18:29,550
Oh my god, you fucker.

7434
05:18:31,810 --> 05:18:33,750
Do I have to get out of here?!

7435
05:18:33,750 --> 05:18:34,890
Congratulations on your newfound faith!

7436
05:18:37,050 --> 05:18:38,450
Oh my god!

7437
05:18:38,450 --> 05:18:38,910
Shut up!

7438
05:18:39,510 --> 05:18:40,030
Haha!

7439
05:18:41,010 --> 05:18:41,590
Haha....

7440
05:18:49,850 --> 05:18:51,010
Oh, God...

7441
05:18:51,790 --> 05:18:52,750
Oh, God...

7442
05:18:52,750 --> 05:18:53,690
Where is he?

7443
05:18:54,640 --> 05:18:55,450
Where is he?

7444
05:18:56,410 --> 05:18:58,030
Getting me out of here...

7445
05:18:58,780 --> 05:18:59,930
I swear!

7446
05:19:00,050 --> 05:19:00,630

7447
05:19:00,710 --> 05:19:01,410

7448
05:19:01,490 --> 05:19:02,450
I swear to God!

7449
05:19:02,530 --> 05:19:03,590
Dude, fuck this guy!

7450
05:19:03,970 --> 05:19:05,630
I can't wait to see you rise!

7451
05:19:06,680 --> 05:19:08,050
I pressed control.

7452
05:19:08,050 --> 05:19:09,410
There is a delay!

7453
05:19:14,010 --> 05:19:15,850
It's not skill diff!

7454
05:19:16,070 --> 05:19:17,250
There is a delay!

7455
05:19:21,830 --> 05:19:22,870
Alright, up I go.

7456
05:19:23,910 --> 05:19:24,710
I did!

7457
05:19:25,590 --> 05:19:27,630
There is a delayed input!

7458
05:19:27,830 --> 05:19:29,110
I swear!

7459
05:19:30,610 --> 05:19:31,370
Ping!

7460
05:19:33,910 --> 05:19:34,730
It's the ping!

7461
05:19:41,010 --> 05:19:42,970
Bro, you have two arms now?

7462
05:19:48,450 --> 05:19:49,170
Wow!

7463
05:19:57,870 --> 05:19:59,310
Damn right!

7464
05:20:00,030 --> 05:20:00,750
See!

7465
05:20:00,890 --> 05:20:01,210
There!

7466
05:20:03,570 --> 05:20:04,450
Oh god!

7467
05:20:04,550 --> 05:20:05,510
It's a...

7468
05:20:07,050 --> 05:20:08,350
Oh, fuck!

7469
05:20:08,630 --> 05:20:08,930
Bro!

7470
05:20:15,780 --> 05:20:16,820
Shoot your fucking feet!

7471
05:20:17,580 --> 05:20:18,600
That's fucking right!

7472
05:20:20,940 --> 05:20:21,600
Oh god!

7473
05:20:23,020 --> 05:20:23,700
Oh god!

7474
05:20:23,760 --> 05:20:24,320
Where are you going?

7475
05:20:24,440 --> 05:20:25,240
Where are you going?

7476
05:20:30,360 --> 05:20:30,800
Why?!

7477
05:20:38,790 --> 05:20:39,230
Why?!

7478
05:20:39,230 --> 05:20:39,630
Woo!

7479
05:20:40,350 --> 05:20:40,790
What?!

7480
05:20:40,790 --> 05:20:41,310
Press F!

7481
05:20:41,610 --> 05:20:42,050
Yeah!

7482
05:20:49,370 --> 05:20:51,090
Oh my god!

7483
05:20:51,570 --> 05:20:53,190
Holy shit!

7484
05:20:54,690 --> 05:20:56,070
Oh god!

7485
05:20:56,250 --> 05:20:57,210
Oh god!

7486
05:20:57,250 --> 05:20:57,970
Please, I have to reload!

7487
05:20:58,990 --> 05:21:00,290
Oh god!

7488
05:21:02,090 --> 05:21:03,730
Oh fucking hell!

7489
05:21:03,890 --> 05:21:04,530
I swear!

7490
05:21:07,350 --> 05:21:09,350
When he does this climb!

7491
05:21:09,610 --> 05:21:10,330
I'm climbing!

7492
05:21:11,350 --> 05:21:12,270
I did it!

7493
05:21:13,090 --> 05:21:13,730
Oh my

7494
05:21:17,110 --> 05:21:19,090
god!

7495
05:21:19,330 --> 05:21:19,490
No!

7496
05:21:19,590 --> 05:21:21,250
Mack Mom is for the final boss!

7497
05:21:26,650 --> 05:21:28,030
I had the high ground!

7498
05:21:28,150 --> 05:21:28,730
Kick him down!

7499
05:21:39,090 --> 05:21:40,910
All I had to do was get high ground!

7500
05:21:41,070 --> 05:21:42,410
That was always the only way!

7501
05:21:44,730 --> 05:21:46,730
And I'll be like, no, I'm better than you.

7502
05:21:46,790 --> 05:21:47,650
I'm not a monster.

7503
05:21:47,890 --> 05:21:49,670
And then he just turns around and looks cool.

7504
05:22:01,280 --> 05:22:02,500
I'm not like you.

7505
05:22:03,180 --> 05:22:05,660
And then you turn around and look so cool.

7506
05:22:05,780 --> 05:22:08,700
And then he's like, Rookie, you should never...

7507
05:22:09,600 --> 05:22:11,540
Oh, he... wait, what?

7508
05:22:16,000 --> 05:22:17,480
What the fuck?

7509
05:22:19,940 --> 05:22:20,540
Okay.

7510
05:22:20,880 --> 05:22:22,260
I did not expect that.

7511
05:22:23,780 --> 05:22:24,760
Never mind.

7512
05:22:27,540 --> 05:22:28,140
I

7513
05:22:31,910 --> 05:22:32,310
would...

7514
05:22:36,270 --> 05:22:36,990
The honor!

7515
05:22:39,450 --> 05:22:41,130
I thought this was anime.

7516
05:22:41,510 --> 05:22:42,250
I did...

7517
05:22:43,910 --> 05:22:48,290
I thought we were in anime after he got rid of his limiters.

7518
05:22:50,930 --> 05:22:51,570
Damn.

7519
05:22:51,790 --> 05:22:53,450
I actually fucking shanked him.

7520
05:22:54,290 --> 05:22:56,630
Leo ain't no boy scout.

7521
05:22:58,790 --> 05:22:59,770
Alright, nice.

7522
05:23:00,950 --> 05:23:01,810
Let's see.

7523
05:23:02,590 --> 05:23:05,310
What the fuck was I supposed to know he'd actually do it?

7524
05:23:05,330 --> 05:23:06,110
Jesus Christ.

7525
05:23:06,270 --> 05:23:07,330
Ryza used so many heals.

7526
05:23:09,150 --> 05:23:09,590
Fuck.

7527
05:23:09,590 --> 05:23:10,730
I can't believe it.

7528
05:23:10,750 --> 05:23:12,070
He actually killed him.

7529
05:23:12,130 --> 05:23:12,910
What a madman.

7530
05:23:19,190 --> 05:23:20,430
Many... Thank you for the super chat.

7531
05:23:20,530 --> 05:23:20,790
Thank you.

7532
05:23:20,790 --> 05:23:21,110
Thank you.

7533
05:23:21,130 --> 05:23:21,330
No.

7534
05:23:21,630 --> 05:23:23,110
I'll never be like you.

7535
05:23:23,390 --> 05:23:24,630
I'll never be...

7536
05:23:25,890 --> 05:23:26,770
President Keeva.

7537
05:23:42,340 --> 05:23:43,200
Cue credits.

7538
05:23:45,760 --> 05:23:46,640
Chapter end.

7539
05:23:47,900 --> 05:23:48,340
Alright.

7540
05:23:48,780 --> 05:23:49,860
This is... Oh wait, no.

7541
05:23:49,920 --> 05:23:50,680
That's not the worst.

7542
05:23:51,500 --> 05:23:52,640
That was not the worst.

7543
05:23:53,240 --> 05:23:54,260
Accuracy I've had.

7544
05:23:56,120 --> 05:23:57,320
Two more chapters.

7545
05:23:58,220 --> 05:23:59,600
We're so close, guys.

7546
05:23:59,900 --> 05:24:01,300
We're almost there.

7547
05:24:01,780 --> 05:24:03,060
Two more chapters!

7548
05:24:05,580 --> 05:24:06,620
Holy fuck!

7549
05:24:06,700 --> 05:24:06,980
Okay.

7550
05:24:07,280 --> 05:24:07,920
Which is...

7551
05:24:07,920 --> 05:24:09,360
This is a knife?

7552
05:24:09,640 --> 05:24:10,140
No.

7553
05:24:10,380 --> 05:24:12,000
This is a knife.

7554
05:24:12,840 --> 05:24:13,440
Alright.

7555
05:24:13,840 --> 05:24:15,620
I have this as my knife now.

7556
05:24:17,620 --> 05:24:20,100
Make your way to the summit.

7557
05:24:23,860 --> 05:24:25,420
This chapter is a pain?

7558
05:24:26,760 --> 05:24:30,160
You mean not the one where I just have to fight that fucking Major?

7559
05:24:30,840 --> 05:24:32,460
Their defenses are no joke.

7560
05:24:38,440 --> 05:24:39,840
That's gotta be their sanctuary.

7561
05:24:42,460 --> 05:24:43,580
Oh, there she is.

7562
05:24:43,800 --> 05:24:44,440
There's Ashley.

7563
05:24:45,300 --> 05:24:45,820
Ashley!

7564
05:24:48,960 --> 05:24:49,480
Alright.

7565
05:24:49,960 --> 05:24:50,480
Fuck.

7566
05:24:50,640 --> 05:24:50,880
Okay.

7567
05:24:52,340 --> 05:24:52,860
Alright.

7568
05:24:52,860 --> 05:24:53,380
Apparently...

7569
05:24:54,120 --> 05:24:55,520
This one is worse.

7570
05:24:55,620 --> 05:24:56,080
I'm gonna have to...

7571
05:25:00,030 --> 05:25:02,470
The last two chapters is a pain.

7572
05:25:02,570 --> 05:25:04,350
Why would you tell me this?

7573
05:25:04,510 --> 05:25:05,870
I thought...

7574
05:25:05,870 --> 05:25:06,230
No!

7575
05:25:08,190 --> 05:25:08,750
How...

7576
05:25:08,750 --> 05:25:09,810
Is this knife stronger?

7577
05:25:12,190 --> 05:25:13,550
Is this knife stronger?

7578
05:25:13,810 --> 05:25:14,710
The fighting knife?

7579
05:25:14,810 --> 05:25:15,770
Than my combat knife?

7580
05:25:20,500 --> 05:25:21,260
Is it actually?

7581
05:25:23,500 --> 05:25:24,080
It is?

7582
05:25:24,280 --> 05:25:24,640
Okay.

7583
05:25:24,840 --> 05:25:26,800
I'm gonna sell this and then I'll sell my...

7584
05:25:27,720 --> 05:25:29,200
I'll sell my combat knife.

7585
05:25:29,240 --> 05:25:30,120
Jesus Christ.

7586
05:25:30,120 --> 05:25:32,900
The price is a hundred and forty seven.

7587
05:25:33,820 --> 05:25:34,880
Holy fuck.

7588
05:25:34,980 --> 05:25:36,200
That is a strong knife.

7589
05:25:36,340 --> 05:25:36,600
Okay.

7590
05:25:37,100 --> 05:25:39,140
I invested a lot on this knife.

7591
05:25:40,560 --> 05:25:41,120
Alright.

7592
05:25:41,220 --> 05:25:41,620
Here we go.

7593
05:25:41,940 --> 05:25:44,020
Get that shit up there.

7594
05:25:44,160 --> 05:25:45,120
And then...

7595
05:25:45,900 --> 05:25:46,020
Coop.

7596
05:25:46,680 --> 05:25:46,980
Coop.

7597
05:25:47,100 --> 05:25:47,660
Okay.

7598
05:25:47,820 --> 05:25:48,380
Nice.

7599
05:25:50,080 --> 05:25:50,640
Alright.

7600
05:25:50,760 --> 05:25:51,120
Nice.

7601
05:25:51,160 --> 05:25:52,500
We're almost there.

7602
05:25:55,480 --> 05:25:56,760
Rest in peace knife?

7603
05:25:56,880 --> 05:25:57,100
What?

7604
05:26:01,320 --> 05:26:02,240
Wait.

7605
05:26:02,360 --> 05:26:02,520
What?

7606
05:26:03,760 --> 05:26:04,680
Don't.

7607
05:26:05,020 --> 05:26:05,940
Wait.

7608
05:26:06,080 --> 05:26:06,400
What?

7609
05:26:11,460 --> 05:26:11,920
Wait.

7610
05:26:12,280 --> 05:26:12,780
What?

7611
05:26:18,750 --> 05:26:20,830
I can do a wheel?

7612
05:26:25,370 --> 05:26:26,290
Oh.

7613
05:26:26,650 --> 05:26:27,570
Whoops.

7614
05:26:28,670 --> 05:26:29,450
That's awkward.

7615
05:26:30,550 --> 05:26:31,010
That's...

7616
05:26:31,750 --> 05:26:33,390
That's very awkward.

7617
05:26:40,090 --> 05:26:40,610
Oh.

7618
05:26:40,710 --> 05:26:40,850
Whoops.

7619
05:26:41,150 --> 05:26:41,910
Oh well.

7620
05:26:42,470 --> 05:26:44,730
But look at how cool my knife is.

7621
05:26:44,830 --> 05:26:45,250
Now.

7622
05:26:45,810 --> 05:26:46,330
Guys.

7623
05:26:47,070 --> 05:26:48,990
My knife looks so cool though.

7624
05:26:49,310 --> 05:26:50,450
Look at it.

7625
05:26:52,990 --> 05:26:55,210
Look at how cool my knife is.

7626
05:26:56,530 --> 05:26:57,050
No.

7627
05:26:57,230 --> 05:26:58,910
We live with our consequences.

7628
05:27:00,450 --> 05:27:00,970
No.

7629
05:27:01,070 --> 05:27:01,490
We live.

7630
05:27:01,650 --> 05:27:02,750
We live with our choices.

7631
05:27:03,130 --> 05:27:04,930
We're not Baldur's gaining this.

7632
05:27:09,010 --> 05:27:10,870
We live with our choices.

7633
05:27:12,670 --> 05:27:14,230
With the mistakes we make.

7634
05:27:14,410 --> 05:27:15,610
Oh my god.

7635
05:27:15,810 --> 05:27:17,790
Oh, I literally, I just...

7636
05:27:17,790 --> 05:27:19,350
Oh, what?

7637
05:27:21,190 --> 05:27:22,030
What was that?

7638
05:27:22,210 --> 05:27:24,910
Oh, is that my reinforcements?

7639
05:27:26,990 --> 05:27:28,710
Bro, how did you not kill this one guy?

7640
05:27:29,610 --> 05:27:30,810
No, you could...

7641
05:27:30,810 --> 05:27:32,490
I was supposed to know!

7642
05:27:36,350 --> 05:27:36,990
Who's that?

7643
05:27:40,950 --> 05:27:41,730
Oh my god.

7644
05:27:43,790 --> 05:27:44,270
Democracy!

7645
05:27:44,850 --> 05:27:45,490
Let's go!

7646
05:27:48,290 --> 05:27:49,730
Let's go, it's democracy time.

7647
05:27:52,350 --> 05:27:52,830
Nice.

7648
05:27:53,410 --> 05:27:55,470
I can loot while he does all the work.

7649
05:27:59,560 --> 05:28:00,040
Nice.

7650
05:28:00,440 --> 05:28:01,540
I'm in the open area!

7651
05:28:03,000 --> 05:28:03,600
I'm here!

7652
05:28:04,900 --> 05:28:05,540
Shoot them!

7653
05:28:06,280 --> 05:28:06,840
Shoot them!

7654
05:28:07,100 --> 05:28:08,000
Shoot them!

7655
05:28:09,980 --> 05:28:11,220
Where is it?

7656
05:28:12,200 --> 05:28:12,840
Bro!

7657
05:28:14,300 --> 05:28:17,580
I'm doing what you told me to do!

7658
05:28:21,100 --> 05:28:22,980
Where the fuck is my...

7659
05:28:22,980 --> 05:28:24,260
Oh, now!

7660
05:28:25,020 --> 05:28:26,980
A little bit too late, man!

7661
05:28:32,040 --> 05:28:33,640
Oh my god.

7662
05:28:33,800 --> 05:28:35,200
A little too late!

7663
05:28:37,280 --> 05:28:38,820
They're still there!

7664
05:28:39,300 --> 05:28:40,000
Oh my god.

7665
05:28:41,400 --> 05:28:42,900
Not me!

7666
05:28:43,360 --> 05:28:44,620
Not me!

7667
05:28:48,740 --> 05:28:49,620
Bro!

7668
05:28:56,840 --> 05:28:57,720
Please.

7669
05:28:58,920 --> 05:28:59,360
Please.

7670
05:29:00,260 --> 05:29:01,880
They're right there.

7671
05:29:02,000 --> 05:29:03,560
They're right there.

7672
05:29:03,660 --> 05:29:04,060
Please.

7673
05:29:07,600 --> 05:29:08,600
Okay, there we go.

7674
05:29:09,480 --> 05:29:10,260
There we go.

7675
05:29:10,260 --> 05:29:10,600
Right here!

7676
05:29:10,760 --> 05:29:11,180
Right here!

7677
05:29:12,600 --> 05:29:13,160
Yeah!

7678
05:29:14,540 --> 05:29:15,460
Friendly fire!

7679
05:29:18,280 --> 05:29:18,840
Please.

7680
05:29:19,720 --> 05:29:20,860
Please, they're still there!

7681
05:29:21,520 --> 05:29:22,940
They're literally still there!

7682
05:29:24,380 --> 05:29:25,680
Bro, look behind you!

7683
05:29:25,740 --> 05:29:26,640
Look behind you!

7684
05:29:27,580 --> 05:29:29,760
Oh, thank god, he actually turned around.

7685
05:29:30,580 --> 05:29:31,700
Turn around!

7686
05:29:32,200 --> 05:29:33,480
Turn around!

7687
05:29:33,480 --> 05:29:34,080
Turn around!

7688
05:29:34,220 --> 05:29:34,740
Turn around!

7689
05:29:34,740 --> 05:29:37,280
Oh my god, thank you.

7690
05:29:37,560 --> 05:29:38,480
Thank you.

7691
05:29:39,540 --> 05:29:40,400
Thank you.

7692
05:29:41,340 --> 05:29:42,620
That's all I wanted.

7693
05:29:42,980 --> 05:29:45,080
I just wanted you to turn around.

7694
05:29:47,460 --> 05:29:48,520
Holy fuck.

7695
05:29:50,060 --> 05:29:52,660
It only took us like 20 tries.

7696
05:29:53,420 --> 05:29:54,540
But he did it.

7697
05:29:55,020 --> 05:29:56,500
He fucking did it.

7698
05:29:59,820 --> 05:30:01,160
Oh, there's boxes here.

7699
05:30:01,200 --> 05:30:01,480
Nice.

7700
05:30:02,320 --> 05:30:02,800
Boxes.

7701
05:30:03,900 --> 05:30:04,380
Money.

7702
05:30:05,040 --> 05:30:06,980
Okay, there is a treasure?

7703
05:30:08,960 --> 05:30:09,960
Okay, nice.

7704
05:30:10,160 --> 05:30:11,180
So much money.

7705
05:30:11,700 --> 05:30:13,080
Is it just money?

7706
05:30:15,180 --> 05:30:16,560
It is just money.

7707
05:30:17,600 --> 05:30:19,260
Guys, maybe I can buy back my gun.

7708
05:30:21,100 --> 05:30:23,940
Guys, guys, I think I can buy back my knife.

7709
05:30:27,060 --> 05:30:28,740
Guys, I think it's possible.

7710
05:30:32,400 --> 05:30:32,920
Okay, nice.

7711
05:30:33,000 --> 05:30:34,280
I got a red barrel.

7712
05:30:37,640 --> 05:30:38,460
Alright, here we go.

7713
05:30:41,480 --> 05:30:42,200
Here we go.

7714
05:30:42,880 --> 05:30:43,260
Let's go.

7715
05:30:46,180 --> 05:30:46,500
Nice.

7716
05:30:49,520 --> 05:30:50,260
Alright, I'll wait here.

7717
05:30:50,360 --> 05:30:51,020
Okay, I'm gonna wait here.

7718
05:30:51,080 --> 05:30:51,660
Go do your thing.

7719
05:30:53,040 --> 05:30:53,860
You go do your thing.

7720
05:30:54,820 --> 05:30:55,660
You go do your thing.

7721
05:30:57,000 --> 05:30:57,460
You go.

7722
05:30:58,200 --> 05:30:58,520
Nice.

7723
05:30:59,380 --> 05:30:59,700
Yay!

7724
05:31:01,480 --> 05:31:02,260
What can I say?

7725
05:31:02,440 --> 05:31:03,340
I never miss.

7726
05:31:04,540 --> 05:31:04,980
Um...

7727
05:31:05,780 --> 05:31:08,180
Yeah, you definitely don't.

7728
05:31:08,180 --> 05:31:09,540
You gotta hit me or the enemy.

7729
05:31:10,100 --> 05:31:10,880
That's for sure.

7730
05:31:12,320 --> 05:31:14,200
He definitely doesn't miss, guys.

7731
05:31:15,080 --> 05:31:17,780
Okay, we're gonna get him right now.

7732
05:31:18,320 --> 05:31:19,480
Bro, what the fuck?

7733
05:31:20,700 --> 05:31:21,980
Who are you shooting at?

7734
05:31:22,040 --> 05:31:22,260
Oh, there.

7735
05:31:23,120 --> 05:31:23,560
Nice.

7736
05:31:23,840 --> 05:31:24,720
I'll just stay here.

7737
05:31:25,500 --> 05:31:26,140
It's alright.

7738
05:31:26,260 --> 05:31:27,060
I'll just stay here.

7739
05:31:27,180 --> 05:31:28,340
Can you shoot that one guy?

7740
05:31:30,100 --> 05:31:31,080
Can you shoot him?

7741
05:31:31,560 --> 05:31:33,420
He's getting awfully close to me.

7742
05:31:36,300 --> 05:31:37,420
He's getting closer.

7743
05:31:41,700 --> 05:31:42,180
Helicopter?

7744
05:31:44,260 --> 05:31:44,740
Helicopter?

7745
05:31:45,320 --> 05:31:46,520
Where are you?

7746
05:31:46,580 --> 05:31:47,560
Oh, there you are.

7747
05:31:49,460 --> 05:31:50,120
Thank you.

7748
05:31:52,280 --> 05:31:53,560
Thank you for the assistance.

7749
05:31:54,640 --> 05:31:55,200
Let's see.

7750
05:31:55,320 --> 05:31:56,540
Is there anything else I'm missing here?

7751
05:31:57,260 --> 05:31:57,780
Alright.

7752
05:31:58,020 --> 05:31:58,520
Boop.

7753
05:31:59,720 --> 05:32:00,240
Apaco.

7754
05:32:04,480 --> 05:32:05,000
Apaco.

7755
05:32:06,480 --> 05:32:07,000
Nice.

7756
05:32:07,300 --> 05:32:08,200
Loot is always good.

7757
05:32:08,440 --> 05:32:09,920
Okay, I can combine this now.

7758
05:32:10,900 --> 05:32:11,420
There.

7759
05:32:11,420 --> 05:32:12,580
That was the only thing I was missing.

7760
05:32:14,440 --> 05:32:15,680
Alright, go do your thing.

7761
05:32:16,240 --> 05:32:17,000
I loot.

7762
05:32:18,940 --> 05:32:20,020
Go do your thing.

7763
05:32:20,900 --> 05:32:22,760
Oh, what is that thing?

7764
05:32:23,420 --> 05:32:23,940
Oh!

7765
05:32:25,940 --> 05:32:26,460
What

7766
05:32:34,740 --> 05:32:35,320
do you mean?

7767
05:32:37,500 --> 05:32:38,400
What the fuck?

7768
05:32:38,460 --> 05:32:40,660
I have to destroy the anti-aircraft?

7769
05:32:42,540 --> 05:32:44,200
Bro, you had one job.

7770
05:32:44,540 --> 05:32:44,960
It's locked.

7771
05:32:45,240 --> 05:32:45,840
It's locked?

7772
05:32:46,700 --> 05:32:47,180
Fuck.

7773
05:32:47,220 --> 05:32:48,260
I guess I go this way?

7774
05:32:49,260 --> 05:32:49,740
Wait.

7775
05:32:49,800 --> 05:32:50,060
Loot.

7776
05:32:50,180 --> 05:32:50,740
Don't worry.

7777
05:32:50,820 --> 05:32:51,220
He'll be fine.

7778
05:32:51,500 --> 05:32:52,360
I just got loot.

7779
05:32:54,660 --> 05:32:55,720
How do I get in?

7780
05:32:57,120 --> 05:32:58,100
How do I get in?

7781
05:33:00,620 --> 05:33:01,100
Alright.

7782
05:33:01,500 --> 05:33:02,180
Knock knock.

7783
05:33:04,960 --> 05:33:05,760
Oh, shit!

7784
05:33:07,560 --> 05:33:08,780
Okay, I did not see that.

7785
05:33:10,080 --> 05:33:10,800
I don't know.

7786
05:33:10,800 --> 05:33:12,100
I'm trying to fucking deal with this guy!

7787
05:33:15,740 --> 05:33:17,100
I am trying so hard!

7788
05:33:18,960 --> 05:33:19,900
Nobody appreciates me.

7789
05:33:22,840 --> 05:33:23,240
Wait.

7790
05:33:23,380 --> 05:33:24,080
What the fuck?

7791
05:33:25,720 --> 05:33:26,120
Wait.

7792
05:33:26,260 --> 05:33:27,000
Get the arm.

7793
05:33:27,860 --> 05:33:28,460
Excuse me.

7794
05:33:28,460 --> 05:33:28,920
Get the arm.

7795
05:33:29,600 --> 05:33:31,120
Okay, maybe I shoot like this.

7796
05:33:31,220 --> 05:33:31,860
There you go.

7797
05:33:32,220 --> 05:33:32,660
Nice.

7798
05:33:34,060 --> 05:33:34,500
Alright.

7799
05:33:35,360 --> 05:33:36,080
Where are the others?

7800
05:33:36,500 --> 05:33:37,140
Oh, it's fine.

7801
05:33:37,280 --> 05:33:37,980
The legs.

7802
05:33:40,660 --> 05:33:41,100
Nice.

7803
05:33:42,200 --> 05:33:43,020
Alright, are you dead?

7804
05:33:43,520 --> 05:33:43,960
Yay!

7805
05:33:45,820 --> 05:33:47,460
No, we're not gonna use the nade.

7806
05:33:47,480 --> 05:33:51,080
We will use everything we have on the last boss.

7807
05:33:54,080 --> 05:33:56,120
Guys, I swear.

7808
05:33:56,240 --> 05:33:57,020
Oh my god.

7809
05:33:57,040 --> 05:33:58,460
It'll be so worth it.

7810
05:33:58,460 --> 05:34:02,240
Guys, we'll use everything on the last boss.

7811
05:34:02,760 --> 05:34:03,360
Guys.

7812
05:34:08,560 --> 05:34:10,340
We'll just throw everything we have.

7813
05:34:10,600 --> 05:34:11,920
All our nades.

7814
05:34:12,400 --> 05:34:13,400
All our...

7815
05:34:13,400 --> 05:34:15,640
All the flashbangs.

7816
05:34:15,740 --> 05:34:16,340
Everything.

7817
05:34:17,740 --> 05:34:18,800
Because you gotta believe.

7818
05:34:22,460 --> 05:34:23,060
Wait.

7819
05:34:23,140 --> 05:34:23,380
What?

7820
05:34:23,540 --> 05:34:24,580
Where's the fire from?

7821
05:34:25,060 --> 05:34:26,420
Oh, there he is.

7822
05:34:26,580 --> 05:34:26,800
Wait.

7823
05:34:26,840 --> 05:34:27,020
No.

7824
05:34:27,140 --> 05:34:29,080
Where the fuck is the fire guy?

7825
05:34:29,560 --> 05:34:31,740
Oh, you're right above me.

7826
05:34:32,800 --> 05:34:33,660
So are you.

7827
05:34:37,720 --> 05:34:38,160
Alright.

7828
05:34:38,740 --> 05:34:39,620
What the fuck?

7829
05:34:39,660 --> 05:34:40,320
Okay, there you are.

7830
05:34:41,300 --> 05:34:42,660
I did not see you there.

7831
05:34:42,900 --> 05:34:43,600
Oh my god.

7832
05:34:43,620 --> 05:34:44,300
Where's your arm?

7833
05:34:46,140 --> 05:34:47,660
Where the fuck is your arm?

7834
05:34:50,060 --> 05:34:50,700
Okay, nice.

7835
05:34:53,720 --> 05:34:57,140
Wouldn't it be funny if the boss is a gimmick and you don't need...

7836
05:34:57,140 --> 05:34:57,780
Excuse me?

7837
05:35:01,800 --> 05:35:04,400
What do you mean the boss is a gimmick?

7838
05:35:06,980 --> 05:35:08,580
What does that mean?

7839
05:35:08,660 --> 05:35:09,400
I'm sorry.

7840
05:35:09,560 --> 05:35:10,780
But what does that mean?

7841
05:35:14,300 --> 05:35:14,800
No.

7842
05:35:14,800 --> 05:35:15,920
There's no way.

7843
05:35:16,160 --> 05:35:16,260
No.

7844
05:35:16,340 --> 05:35:17,220
You're fucking with me.

7845
05:35:17,240 --> 05:35:17,860
There's no way.

7846
05:35:18,540 --> 05:35:19,540
There's no way.

7847
05:35:19,660 --> 05:35:21,400
You have to be fucking with me.

7848
05:35:23,140 --> 05:35:24,660
That'd be so funny.

7849
05:35:24,860 --> 05:35:26,300
But we all know that's a joke.

7850
05:35:27,360 --> 05:35:28,580
It'd be so funny.

7851
05:35:28,680 --> 05:35:29,860
But it's a joke, right?

7852
05:35:31,740 --> 05:35:32,940
Right, guys?

7853
05:35:37,640 --> 05:35:38,400
But what?

7854
05:35:38,460 --> 05:35:39,740
Yeah, it's all like hypothetical.

7855
05:35:41,100 --> 05:35:43,240
It's just a hypothetical, right guys?

7856
05:35:43,740 --> 05:35:44,820
Yeah, what if?

7857
05:35:44,960 --> 05:35:47,120
What if in this hypothetical situation...

7858
05:35:47,860 --> 05:35:48,940
That doesn't exist?

7859
05:35:52,600 --> 05:35:53,720
That's not real.

7860
05:35:54,860 --> 05:35:57,380
This purely hypothetical situation.

7861
05:36:00,900 --> 05:36:01,960
Alright, this way.

7862
05:36:03,520 --> 05:36:04,840
What the fuck is this?

7863
05:36:05,120 --> 05:36:06,000
How do I...

7864
05:36:06,000 --> 05:36:06,220
What?

7865
05:36:06,820 --> 05:36:07,360
Wait!

7866
05:36:07,480 --> 05:36:08,220
How do I...

7867
05:36:08,690 --> 05:36:10,040
Okay, I ran in the circle.

7868
05:36:10,280 --> 05:36:12,240
I ran in a circle.

7869
05:36:15,780 --> 05:36:17,420
We go back up.

7870
05:36:21,770 --> 05:36:22,770
Alright, here we go.

7871
05:36:22,930 --> 05:36:24,490
How the fuck do I go get there?

7872
05:36:25,930 --> 05:36:26,930
Go, go, Leon!

7873
05:36:29,750 --> 05:36:30,310
Leon!

7874
05:36:30,350 --> 05:36:30,910
How?

7875
05:36:32,470 --> 05:36:33,030
How?

7876
05:36:35,310 --> 05:36:36,430
Climb the tower?

7877
05:36:36,650 --> 05:36:37,030
Where?

7878
05:36:37,390 --> 05:36:37,850
Oh, this?

7879
05:36:40,370 --> 05:36:41,770
I climbed this tower?

7880
05:36:43,590 --> 05:36:44,750
Oh my god.

7881
05:36:44,890 --> 05:36:45,870
I was so confused.

7882
05:36:46,150 --> 05:36:47,170
Oh my god.

7883
05:36:47,530 --> 05:36:49,330
Where the fuck did you come from?

7884
05:36:49,390 --> 05:36:49,770
Boom!

7885
05:36:51,890 --> 05:36:52,970
Okay, we're fine.

7886
05:36:54,990 --> 05:36:55,550
Nice.

7887
05:36:55,570 --> 05:36:56,350
And then...

7888
05:36:56,930 --> 05:36:58,750
We're gonna get rid of you real fast.

7889
05:36:59,590 --> 05:37:02,990
And then he is not gonna shoot that rocket, right?

7890
05:37:03,850 --> 05:37:04,290
Nice.

7891
05:37:04,350 --> 05:37:05,490
Wait, it didn't even hit him.

7892
05:37:05,770 --> 05:37:07,250
Did this man just tank a rocket?

7893
05:37:08,690 --> 05:37:09,810
Bro, this is not fair.

7894
05:37:12,450 --> 05:37:13,370
How can he...

7895
05:37:13,910 --> 05:37:15,150
Oh god, tank the rocket.

7896
05:37:15,230 --> 05:37:15,690
Tank the rocket.

7897
05:37:15,770 --> 05:37:16,290
Tank the rocket.

7898
05:37:16,530 --> 05:37:17,250
Tank the rocket.

7899
05:37:17,370 --> 05:37:17,910
Shoot the rocket.

7900
05:37:18,430 --> 05:37:19,290
Shoot the rocket.

7901
05:37:19,850 --> 05:37:20,710
Shoot the rocket!

7902
05:37:20,950 --> 05:37:21,350
Yeah!

7903
05:37:23,290 --> 05:37:25,370
That's how you game and he's still alive.

7904
05:37:28,630 --> 05:37:29,910
Alright, where is this guy?

7905
05:37:33,470 --> 05:37:33,870
Why?

7906
05:37:37,630 --> 05:37:39,090
I'm just gonna shoot you in the crotch.

7907
05:37:39,210 --> 05:37:39,670
Fuck this.

7908
05:37:41,590 --> 05:37:42,390
Fuck this.

7909
05:37:42,410 --> 05:37:46,570
I do not have the patience to headshot you.

7910
05:37:49,810 --> 05:37:50,590
There you go.

7911
05:37:52,730 --> 05:37:53,670
Wait, where did he go?

7912
05:37:53,750 --> 05:37:54,890
Wait, he just... Okay, nice.

7913
05:37:54,950 --> 05:37:55,150
Crit.

7914
05:37:55,150 --> 05:37:55,290
Crit.

7915
05:37:55,810 --> 05:37:56,330
Crit.

7916
05:37:57,950 --> 05:37:58,610
Let's go.

7917
05:37:58,810 --> 05:37:59,490
Up we go.

7918
05:38:00,290 --> 05:38:01,250
Up we go!

7919
05:38:02,770 --> 05:38:03,610
Anybody here?

7920
05:38:04,290 --> 05:38:05,830
Oh, machine gun.

7921
05:38:06,510 --> 05:38:07,910
Alright, so do you need shotgun?

7922
05:38:08,150 --> 05:38:08,710
Not shotgun.

7923
05:38:08,910 --> 05:38:09,550
Handgun ammo?

7924
05:38:10,430 --> 05:38:10,950
Nice.

7925
05:38:12,410 --> 05:38:13,450
Did you see this?

7926
05:38:15,090 --> 05:38:15,930
Is that it?

7927
05:38:16,390 --> 05:38:17,450
Am I doing anything?

7928
05:38:18,850 --> 05:38:19,370
Yeah!

7929
05:38:22,580 --> 05:38:25,280
It's so hard to tell if I was actually doing anything.

7930
05:38:25,380 --> 05:38:25,760
Yeah!

7931
05:38:27,900 --> 05:38:28,340
Nice.

7932
05:38:28,480 --> 05:38:28,920
Nice.

7933
05:38:32,080 --> 05:38:32,700
It's fine.

7934
05:38:34,620 --> 05:38:35,440
It's fine.

7935
05:38:35,560 --> 05:38:36,340
I don't really...

7936
05:38:37,180 --> 05:38:38,340
Like, what are you gonna do?

7937
05:38:38,660 --> 05:38:40,700
There's so... It's such a long way to get to me.

7938
05:38:42,100 --> 05:38:44,000
Like, they have to walk so long.

7939
05:38:44,260 --> 05:38:45,020
So far.

7940
05:38:46,420 --> 05:38:47,420
I'm just gonna drop down.

7941
05:38:48,440 --> 05:38:50,340
Maybe if I just beam this guy down.

7942
05:38:51,020 --> 05:38:52,000
Alright, nice.

7943
05:38:52,180 --> 05:38:52,660
Drop down.

7944
05:38:52,780 --> 05:38:52,940
Nope.

7945
05:38:54,160 --> 05:38:55,520
Let me drop down here.

7946
05:38:58,180 --> 05:38:58,820
Nice.

7947
05:38:58,820 --> 05:38:59,280
Free loot.

7948
05:39:00,120 --> 05:39:00,760
Hello?

7949
05:39:02,080 --> 05:39:02,920
Oh, nice!

7950
05:39:03,240 --> 05:39:03,880
More loot!

7951
05:39:06,480 --> 05:39:07,120
Yay!

7952
05:39:10,680 --> 05:39:11,320
Yippee!

7953
05:39:15,240 --> 05:39:16,480
Holy shit.

7954
05:39:17,320 --> 05:39:18,740
Get that door open.

7955
05:39:19,160 --> 05:39:21,180
This is like an action game now.

7956
05:39:22,500 --> 05:39:23,140
Wow!

7957
05:39:24,040 --> 05:39:25,320
What the fuck?

7958
05:39:28,370 --> 05:39:29,090
I swear.

7959
05:39:30,130 --> 05:39:32,410
This is just Call of Duty.

7960
05:39:38,630 --> 05:39:40,110
We're Call of Dutying now.

7961
05:39:41,070 --> 05:39:44,210
The only issue is that I'm playing Call of Duty with a handgun.

7962
05:39:45,130 --> 05:39:46,430
That's the only issue.

7963
05:39:49,070 --> 05:39:49,550
Wooo!

7964
05:39:49,710 --> 05:39:51,230
Where did you come from?

7965
05:39:52,990 --> 05:39:53,930
Holy fuck!

7966
05:39:54,050 --> 05:39:54,530
Okay.

7967
05:39:54,710 --> 05:39:55,590
Bro, fuck this.

7968
05:39:57,090 --> 05:39:58,850
Bro, why are you running?

7969
05:40:00,290 --> 05:40:02,170
Where did they come from?

7970
05:40:03,750 --> 05:40:06,430
Where did all of them come from?

7971
05:40:10,190 --> 05:40:11,510
Okay, how strong is this?

7972
05:40:11,550 --> 05:40:12,650
This knife is actually pretty strong.

7973
05:40:14,130 --> 05:40:15,190
Like... Kick!

7974
05:40:17,250 --> 05:40:17,810
Nice.

7975
05:40:18,370 --> 05:40:19,310
Oh shit!

7976
05:40:19,390 --> 05:40:19,510
Oh!

7977
05:40:22,130 --> 05:40:24,730
Alright, nice.

7978
05:40:25,210 --> 05:40:26,150
Oh god.

7979
05:40:26,270 --> 05:40:27,130
Where is he coming from?

7980
05:40:27,130 --> 05:40:28,250
Where is it?

7981
05:40:28,470 --> 05:40:29,550
Where does it go?

7982
05:40:30,950 --> 05:40:31,570
There we go.

7983
05:40:33,690 --> 05:40:34,490
Holy fuck!

7984
05:40:34,990 --> 05:40:35,830
Give me a sec.

7985
05:40:35,950 --> 05:40:36,630
I need a reload!

7986
05:40:37,770 --> 05:40:38,610
Who shot me?

7987
05:40:42,490 --> 05:40:42,890
What?!

7988
05:40:42,890 --> 05:40:44,110
Oh my god!

7989
05:40:45,230 --> 05:40:45,810
There we go.

7990
05:40:46,650 --> 05:40:47,210
There we go.

7991
05:40:47,710 --> 05:40:48,110
Alright.

7992
05:40:48,250 --> 05:40:49,150
No, no, no, no, no, no!

7993
05:40:52,900 --> 05:40:53,540
There we go.

7994
05:40:53,540 --> 05:40:53,860
Nice.

7995
05:40:54,180 --> 05:40:55,040
What the fuck?

7996
05:40:55,180 --> 05:40:55,920
Oh, it's the parasite.

7997
05:40:57,420 --> 05:40:57,960
Fuck this.

7998
05:40:58,060 --> 05:40:58,480
I don't care.

7999
05:41:00,160 --> 05:41:00,820
There we go.

8000
05:41:00,900 --> 05:41:00,980
There we go.

8001
05:41:00,980 --> 05:41:01,780
Shoot you in the leg.

8002
05:41:02,560 --> 05:41:03,660
Is he still alive?

8003
05:41:04,040 --> 05:41:05,220
How are you still alive?

8004
05:41:09,340 --> 05:41:09,900
Where?

8005
05:41:10,140 --> 05:41:10,460
How?

8006
05:41:11,960 --> 05:41:12,680
Oh god.

8007
05:41:16,390 --> 05:41:16,950
Please!

8008
05:41:18,210 --> 05:41:21,650
He's spawning!

8009
05:41:24,630 --> 05:41:26,470
I don't have enough ammo!

8010
05:41:27,910 --> 05:41:30,050
How did you dodge all of that?

8011
05:41:32,950 --> 05:41:33,850
Oh my god.

8012
05:41:33,890 --> 05:41:34,170
Oh my god.

8013
05:41:34,170 --> 05:41:36,850
The tankiest fucking sniper out there.

8014
05:41:37,210 --> 05:41:38,770
That's actually crazy.

8015
05:41:39,170 --> 05:41:40,250
Just leave.

8016
05:41:41,090 --> 05:41:41,970
I can't!

8017
05:41:41,990 --> 05:41:43,170
They just look at me!

8018
05:41:43,230 --> 05:41:43,970
They look so delicious!

8019
05:41:45,510 --> 05:41:48,390
You ever just look at people and was like, I can shoot that.

8020
05:41:53,030 --> 05:41:53,850
Oh my god.

8021
05:41:53,890 --> 05:41:54,390
Now I know why.

8022
05:41:54,470 --> 05:41:55,870
Now I know why people hate this level.

8023
05:41:56,030 --> 05:41:56,770
Now I know.

8024
05:41:57,950 --> 05:41:59,010
Now I fucking know.

8025
05:41:59,350 --> 05:42:01,370
This level is actually insane.

8026
05:42:02,290 --> 05:42:03,630
This level is so tilty.

8027
05:42:05,030 --> 05:42:06,070
You're serious.

8028
05:42:06,450 --> 05:42:07,010
Really?

8029
05:42:09,210 --> 05:42:09,850
Okay.

8030
05:42:10,330 --> 05:42:11,910
Alright, we're just getting rid of you.

8031
05:42:14,910 --> 05:42:16,050
Alright, let's see.

8032
05:42:16,310 --> 05:42:16,950
No!

8033
05:42:17,990 --> 05:42:18,550
Thank you.

8034
05:42:18,590 --> 05:42:19,070
Thank god.

8035
05:42:19,890 --> 05:42:21,290
Thank fucking god.

8036
05:42:22,990 --> 05:42:23,630
Alright.

8037
05:42:23,890 --> 05:42:24,330
Door!

8038
05:42:26,290 --> 05:42:27,370
I'm trying!

8039
05:42:27,470 --> 05:42:28,990
There's so many people.

8040
05:42:29,630 --> 05:42:31,550
There's so many people.

8041
05:42:33,930 --> 05:42:34,490
Oh.

8042
05:42:34,570 --> 05:42:35,290
Oh my god.

8043
05:42:36,150 --> 05:42:36,710
Please.

8044
05:42:37,290 --> 05:42:39,190
I'm bringing the big guns down!

8045
05:42:40,430 --> 05:42:41,410
Get closer!

8046
05:42:43,330 --> 05:42:44,110
There you go.

8047
05:42:44,650 --> 05:42:46,690
He has to, like, super die, right?

8048
05:42:47,810 --> 05:42:49,310
Is he super dead yet?

8049
05:42:49,530 --> 05:42:50,270
Nice, okay.

8050
05:42:50,470 --> 05:42:51,550
They're super dead.

8051
05:42:54,150 --> 05:42:56,110
Are you fucking kidding me?!

8052
05:42:56,110 --> 05:42:56,950
I literally...

8053
05:42:56,950 --> 05:42:58,890
I swear to god.

8054
05:42:59,010 --> 05:43:00,470
I literally just got down.

8055
05:43:00,990 --> 05:43:01,550
Literally.

8056
05:43:03,090 --> 05:43:05,310
Are you fucking kidding me?

8057
05:43:06,270 --> 05:43:09,470
Bro, are you super- NO WAY!

8058
05:43:11,470 --> 05:43:12,210
No way.

8059
05:43:12,850 --> 05:43:13,990
No fucking way.

8060
05:43:14,050 --> 05:43:14,470
This is it.

8061
05:43:14,510 --> 05:43:15,270
This is it.

8062
05:43:15,330 --> 05:43:15,870
Fuck this.

8063
05:43:16,490 --> 05:43:17,350
This is it!

8064
05:43:18,290 --> 05:43:19,330
Super nade.

8065
05:43:20,630 --> 05:43:21,710
Super nade!

8066
05:43:21,750 --> 05:43:21,950
I-

8067
05:43:27,250 --> 05:43:31,610
Okay, I messed up super nade.

8068
05:43:37,050 --> 05:43:40,590
Guys, I might have messed up with super nade.

8069
05:43:45,290 --> 05:43:47,730
Guys, it was made a little oopsie.

8070
05:43:48,290 --> 05:43:50,450
Just a little oopsie there.

8071
05:43:54,010 --> 05:43:54,610
Look!

8072
05:43:54,810 --> 05:43:56,310
I could- It said it was super!

8073
05:43:56,630 --> 05:43:59,390
The nade was bigger than the normal nade!

8074
05:44:00,250 --> 05:44:03,830
I wasn't using- I was not used to the fucking- I was not, guys.

8075
05:44:04,010 --> 05:44:04,750
You don't understand.

8076
05:44:05,190 --> 05:44:08,850
I was not used to the fucking weight of the super nade.

8077
05:44:08,990 --> 05:44:11,550
I was throwing mini nades this entire time.

8078
05:44:16,930 --> 05:44:18,350
You don't understand.

8079
05:44:18,590 --> 05:44:20,970
I was throwing mini nades this entire time.

8080
05:44:21,170 --> 05:44:22,270
They're different weights.

8081
05:44:26,610 --> 05:44:28,890
Holy fuck I made it.

8082
05:44:29,550 --> 05:44:30,570
Oh my god.

8083
05:44:30,570 --> 05:44:31,490
I'm finally inside.

8084
05:44:31,530 --> 05:44:32,030
I'm inside.

8085
05:44:32,030 --> 05:44:33,950
I'm finally inside.

8086
05:44:35,050 --> 05:44:37,050
Oh my fucking god.

8087
05:44:38,530 --> 05:44:40,650
I'm not inside?!

8088
05:44:42,810 --> 05:44:43,430
Oh!

8089
05:44:46,370 --> 05:44:46,990
Oh!

8090
05:44:54,650 --> 05:44:56,650
I thought it was still a cutscene.

8091
05:44:56,770 --> 05:44:57,190
I don't know.

8092
05:44:57,230 --> 05:44:58,510
I thought he wanted to do something.

8093
05:45:07,000 --> 05:45:09,030
Bro, I'm not getting on that helicopter.

8094
05:45:09,810 --> 05:45:11,470
I'm so fucking dead.

8095
05:45:11,710 --> 05:45:11,890
Yeah.

8096
05:45:12,510 --> 05:45:13,910
There's no way!

8097
05:45:14,350 --> 05:45:16,410
Yeah, this man's dead dead.

8098
05:45:16,670 --> 05:45:17,070
Goodbye!

8099
05:45:18,390 --> 05:45:19,830
Oh, you're training!

8100
05:45:22,930 --> 05:45:23,810
Oh no!

8101
05:45:23,990 --> 05:45:24,590
He's training!

8102
05:45:26,230 --> 05:45:27,890
Mr. Frost, make it down!

8103
05:45:29,610 --> 05:45:31,350
Hey Cal, they give us super chat.

8104
05:45:31,410 --> 05:45:34,490
They can throw ki strikes again.

8105
05:45:36,110 --> 05:45:37,190
The freedom!

8106
05:45:37,250 --> 05:45:38,070
No, Mike!

8107
05:45:42,220 --> 05:45:43,260
Adam Sandler.

8108
05:45:46,720 --> 05:45:48,780
Oh god, now it's bug time.

8109
05:45:52,490 --> 05:45:55,150
I'll make sure you're the next to go, Sandler.

8110
05:45:56,990 --> 05:45:57,910
Oh, fuck this.

8111
05:45:58,290 --> 05:45:59,010
Fuck this.

8112
05:46:00,050 --> 05:46:00,910
Fuck this.

8113
05:46:02,030 --> 05:46:02,950
Fuck this.

8114
05:46:03,390 --> 05:46:04,050
Fuck this.

8115
05:46:04,330 --> 05:46:04,370
Fuck this.

8116
05:46:05,970 --> 05:46:06,950
I can't.

8117
05:46:06,950 --> 05:46:09,210
I can't deal with this right now.

8118
05:46:10,010 --> 05:46:10,870
Alright, here we go.

8119
05:46:13,190 --> 05:46:14,530
Oh my god, bro.

8120
05:46:14,610 --> 05:46:15,030
Oh my god, bro.

8121
05:46:15,050 --> 05:46:16,190
My HP is so fucked right now.

8122
05:46:16,350 --> 05:46:17,490
My HP.

8123
05:46:19,190 --> 05:46:19,870
Alright.

8124
05:46:19,870 --> 05:46:21,030
We gotta heal.

8125
05:46:21,730 --> 05:46:23,490
We're maxed out now.

8126
05:46:24,690 --> 05:46:26,450
We're mega maxed.

8127
05:46:28,250 --> 05:46:29,070
Oh hey.

8128
05:46:31,390 --> 05:46:32,070
Wait.

8129
05:46:32,810 --> 05:46:33,490
Nice.

8130
05:46:36,250 --> 05:46:37,550
Holy shit.

8131
05:46:39,750 --> 05:46:41,810
We gotta grab the medallions.

8132
05:46:44,150 --> 05:46:44,670
Alright.

8133
05:46:44,790 --> 05:46:46,090
Where are all these medallions?

8134
05:46:46,130 --> 05:46:47,010
Is it worth it?

8135
05:46:47,350 --> 05:46:47,870
God.

8136
05:46:47,870 --> 05:46:49,010
Is it even worth it?

8137
05:46:52,710 --> 05:46:54,750
We've already maxed out our HP.

8138
05:46:55,190 --> 05:46:57,770
We don't have to worry about that anymore.

8139
05:46:58,210 --> 05:46:59,530
Where the fuck is that?

8140
05:47:00,110 --> 05:47:01,590
Where is that medallion?

8141
05:47:03,110 --> 05:47:04,710
Is the medallion down there?

8142
05:47:07,150 --> 05:47:07,670
Okay.

8143
05:47:09,750 --> 05:47:11,750
There's like a medallion here somewhere.

8144
05:47:14,430 --> 05:47:14,990
Medallion?

8145
05:47:18,210 --> 05:47:18,770
Medallion?

8146
05:47:19,490 --> 05:47:20,050
Medallion?

8147
05:47:20,230 --> 05:47:21,730
Am I looking at it?

8148
05:47:22,410 --> 05:47:23,670
Where is it?

8149
05:47:24,370 --> 05:47:25,290
Oh my.

8150
05:47:25,350 --> 05:47:25,630
Dude.

8151
05:47:25,670 --> 05:47:26,490
I don't care enough.

8152
05:47:26,710 --> 05:47:27,110
I don't.

8153
05:47:29,690 --> 05:47:30,250
Guys.

8154
05:47:30,530 --> 05:47:35,030
I am like this close to not giving a fuck about this medallion.

8155
05:47:35,650 --> 05:47:36,830
I'm so close.

8156
05:47:40,030 --> 05:47:40,690
It's like.

8157
05:47:40,870 --> 05:47:41,790
I'm like right there.

8158
05:47:41,810 --> 05:47:42,330
Right now.

8159
05:47:45,590 --> 05:47:46,110
Guys.

8160
05:47:46,330 --> 05:47:47,470
We did not.

8161
05:47:47,490 --> 05:47:49,730
We are not close to 100% guys.

8162
05:47:50,050 --> 05:47:51,390
There's no fucking way.

8163
05:47:54,030 --> 05:47:55,290
Is the medallion here?

8164
05:47:57,430 --> 05:47:58,110
Oh wait.

8165
05:47:58,170 --> 05:47:58,570
There's treasure.

8166
05:48:00,710 --> 05:48:01,230
Treasure.

8167
05:48:03,210 --> 05:48:03,730
Yeah.

8168
05:48:05,070 --> 05:48:05,590
Okay.

8169
05:48:05,610 --> 05:48:06,750
Medallion is somewhere here.

8170
05:48:06,830 --> 05:48:07,390
I can feel it.

8171
05:48:08,050 --> 05:48:09,030
I feel it.

8172
05:48:10,070 --> 05:48:11,610
I feel the medallion.

8173
05:48:12,010 --> 05:48:15,010
The bones of our brethren rest in all nations.

8174
05:48:15,310 --> 05:48:15,950
The bones of our brethren rest in all nations.

8175
05:48:15,950 --> 05:48:17,710
The blood of our brethren provide all food.

8176
05:48:17,850 --> 05:48:18,010
The blood of our brethren provide all food.

8177
05:48:18,010 --> 05:48:19,410
We die only to be reborn.

8178
05:48:20,010 --> 05:48:21,550
We live on through eternity.

8179
05:48:21,730 --> 05:48:22,610
We reign absolute.

8180
05:48:23,950 --> 05:48:24,430
Alright.

8181
05:48:24,450 --> 05:48:24,810
What's this?

8182
05:48:25,070 --> 05:48:26,050
Oh my god.

8183
05:48:26,810 --> 05:48:29,270
This historical item that I'm gonna sell.

8184
05:48:32,690 --> 05:48:33,210
Okay.

8185
05:48:33,930 --> 05:48:35,470
It has to be here somewhere.

8186
05:48:37,410 --> 05:48:38,650
Where is it?

8187
05:48:38,690 --> 05:48:39,730
Where am I looking at?

8188
05:48:41,350 --> 05:48:41,910
Where?

8189
05:48:43,570 --> 05:48:44,130
Where?

8190
05:48:44,510 --> 05:48:46,190
Where the fuck is it?

8191
05:48:49,790 --> 05:48:51,810
It belongs in the museum.

8192
05:48:53,670 --> 05:48:54,610
Oh my god.

8193
05:48:54,630 --> 05:48:55,250
There it is.

8194
05:48:58,130 --> 05:48:58,990
Got one.

8195
05:48:59,150 --> 05:49:00,410
We need two more.

8196
05:49:03,870 --> 05:49:04,750
Just two more.

8197
05:49:07,910 --> 05:49:08,570
Alright guys.

8198
05:49:08,630 --> 05:49:09,270
Use your eyes.

8199
05:49:09,750 --> 05:49:11,170
This is your time to shine.

8200
05:49:12,850 --> 05:49:14,390
It's time to use your eyes.

8201
05:49:14,490 --> 05:49:14,750
Oh there.

8202
05:49:15,170 --> 05:49:16,210
I used my eyes.

8203
05:49:16,650 --> 05:49:17,330
Last one.

8204
05:49:18,070 --> 05:49:19,690
Last one is all the way back there.

8205
05:49:20,990 --> 05:49:21,710
Last to be.

8206
05:49:24,370 --> 05:49:26,050
There could be no other way.

8207
05:49:29,330 --> 05:49:30,210
Guys it's time.

8208
05:49:30,230 --> 05:49:30,390
Guys it's time.

8209
05:49:30,410 --> 05:49:32,110
Open your eyes.

8210
05:49:33,030 --> 05:49:33,630
Nice.

8211
05:49:34,030 --> 05:49:34,850
I knew.

8212
05:49:36,310 --> 05:49:39,090
I knew I could trust all of you guys to open your eyes.

8213
05:49:40,450 --> 05:49:41,050
Bam.

8214
05:49:41,230 --> 05:49:42,090
I did it.

8215
05:49:44,250 --> 05:49:45,430
I looked up.

8216
05:49:45,830 --> 05:49:46,110
What the?

8217
05:49:48,190 --> 05:49:48,790
No.

8218
05:49:57,530 --> 05:49:59,570
I fucking knew it.

8219
05:50:03,510 --> 05:50:05,350
I fucking knew it.

8220
05:50:05,990 --> 05:50:07,050
I was like.

8221
05:50:07,130 --> 05:50:07,730
I was like.

8222
05:50:08,390 --> 05:50:09,530
I knew it.

8223
05:50:09,530 --> 05:50:11,170
I fucking knew it.

8224
05:50:11,310 --> 05:50:12,090
I was like.

8225
05:50:12,170 --> 05:50:12,910
Body bag?

8226
05:50:13,270 --> 05:50:13,870
No.

8227
05:50:17,250 --> 05:50:18,650
There's no way.

8228
05:50:18,750 --> 05:50:23,270
There's a random fucking pile of body bags here.

8229
05:50:27,150 --> 05:50:29,190
I'm just swinging around.

8230
05:50:30,790 --> 05:50:32,630
As if there's nothing at all.

8231
05:50:32,990 --> 05:50:35,030
It's like they're wearing nothing at all.

8232
05:50:37,750 --> 05:50:37,890
Alright.

8233
05:50:39,570 --> 05:50:40,810
I felt it.

8234
05:50:42,730 --> 05:50:43,410
Oh.

8235
05:50:43,870 --> 05:50:44,550
Guys.

8236
05:50:44,930 --> 05:50:46,070
I felt it.

8237
05:50:49,950 --> 05:50:51,730
The repairs were complete.

8238
05:50:52,610 --> 05:50:53,770
Completed without issue.

8239
05:50:54,150 --> 05:50:57,490
Since the facility was previously used for confinement.

8240
05:50:57,850 --> 05:51:01,410
The work required to reinforce the airtight ceiling was minimal.

8241
05:51:01,790 --> 05:51:05,290
As long as we don't run into any issues with the cooling system test.

8242
05:51:05,510 --> 05:51:07,730
We plan to bring in all of the.

8243
05:51:07,750 --> 05:51:09,730
remaining specimens from facility 1.

8244
05:51:11,270 --> 05:51:13,650
All specimens were successfully transferred.

8245
05:51:13,870 --> 05:51:16,370
However, we experienced a slight hiccup during the transfer.

8246
05:51:16,470 --> 05:51:16,590
However, we experienced a slight hiccup during the transfer.

8247
05:51:16,590 --> 05:51:17,590
As one of them became violent.

8248
05:51:17,830 --> 05:51:20,950
Luckily, the number of casualties was less than anticipated.

8249
05:51:21,290 --> 05:51:23,850
Please be extra careful when dealing with them.

8250
05:51:23,970 --> 05:51:27,990
I received reports that they are beginning to acquire a tolerance to the low temperature.

8251
05:51:28,370 --> 05:51:28,530
I received reports that they are beginning to acquire a tolerance to the low temperature.

8252
05:51:28,530 --> 05:51:29,470
Oh my god.

8253
05:51:29,490 --> 05:51:30,290
Bro, why?

8254
05:51:30,770 --> 05:51:32,170
Do you really need more?

8255
05:51:33,750 --> 05:51:36,130
Do you really need to fuck me over even more?

8256
05:51:36,370 --> 05:51:36,450
Do you really need to fuck me over even more?

8257
05:51:38,470 --> 05:51:39,850
Oh no.

8258
05:51:44,420 --> 05:51:45,580
Where is it?

8259
05:51:46,460 --> 05:51:47,780
Where is that one?

8260
05:51:48,100 --> 05:51:49,300
There you are.

8261
05:51:49,860 --> 05:51:51,760
I can see you.

8262
05:51:53,480 --> 05:51:55,180
I see you.

8263
05:52:00,300 --> 05:52:01,840
I see you.

8264
05:52:02,740 --> 05:52:04,300
I see you.

8265
05:52:04,640 --> 05:52:05,700
I see you.

8266
05:52:05,700 --> 05:52:06,240
I see you.

8267
05:52:09,060 --> 05:52:09,820
Oh.

8268
05:52:11,680 --> 05:52:12,680
Wait, what?

8269
05:52:12,860 --> 05:52:13,240
What?

8270
05:52:13,560 --> 05:52:15,160
Oh no.

8271
05:52:15,260 --> 05:52:16,940
It's the Iron Maiden bullshit!

8272
05:52:18,600 --> 05:52:19,200
Okay.

8273
05:52:19,780 --> 05:52:21,240
I have to do this again.

8274
05:52:24,320 --> 05:52:25,460
What the fuck?

8275
05:52:25,580 --> 05:52:25,800
Okay.

8276
05:52:28,840 --> 05:52:29,740
Do you need more?

8277
05:52:30,540 --> 05:52:31,660
Wait, was there...

8278
05:52:31,660 --> 05:52:32,980
Oh my god.

8279
05:52:33,040 --> 05:52:34,260
This was the way to...

8280
05:52:34,260 --> 05:52:35,640
Oh my god.

8281
05:52:36,100 --> 05:52:36,700
No!

8282
05:52:36,700 --> 05:52:36,780
No!

8283
05:52:38,020 --> 05:52:38,580
Okay.

8284
05:52:41,240 --> 05:52:44,200
Oh, I thought this was not the way to go!

8285
05:52:48,940 --> 05:52:49,780
Oh, I thought this was not the way to go!

8286
05:52:49,780 --> 05:52:52,680
I legitimately thought I went the, like, the detour.

8287
05:52:54,660 --> 05:52:55,920
Just wanna be sure.

8288
05:52:56,480 --> 05:52:57,200
You know.

8289
05:52:58,020 --> 05:52:59,360
Just wanna be sure.

8290
05:53:00,760 --> 05:53:02,540
Can't trust anybody anymore.

8291
05:53:04,860 --> 05:53:06,080
Oh my god.

8292
05:53:06,100 --> 05:53:07,220
There's still the snake?

8293
05:53:07,800 --> 05:53:07,880
Oh my god.

8294
05:53:07,880 --> 05:53:07,880
There's still the snake?

8295
05:53:07,880 --> 05:53:10,280
Where did he go?

8296
05:53:11,560 --> 05:53:13,840
Where did the snake go?

8297
05:53:14,460 --> 05:53:16,120
Where did the snake go?

8298
05:53:17,440 --> 05:53:18,160
Where did the snake go?

8299
05:53:18,160 --> 05:53:19,300
Guys, I lost the snake.

8300
05:53:19,440 --> 05:53:21,200
I lost the snake.

8301
05:53:22,740 --> 05:53:24,100
He just disappeared!

8302
05:53:26,340 --> 05:53:27,600
Where did he go?

8303
05:53:32,540 --> 05:53:34,080
Bro, he's slithered out!

8304
05:53:34,440 --> 05:53:34,780
Bro, he's slithered out!

8305
05:53:34,780 --> 05:53:35,800
He's just gone!

8306
05:53:37,000 --> 05:53:38,800
He's actually just gone!

8307
05:53:39,360 --> 05:53:40,080
Like...

8308
05:53:43,390 --> 05:53:44,110
There you go.

8309
05:53:44,410 --> 05:53:44,890
Nice.

8310
05:53:48,250 --> 05:53:49,090
There he was.

8311
05:53:49,910 --> 05:53:52,610
He thought he could fuck me over here.

8312
05:53:55,330 --> 05:53:56,310
It's not through here.

8313
05:53:56,870 --> 05:53:58,270
I guess it's through here then.

8314
05:54:00,330 --> 05:54:01,850
Oh my god, I see you.

8315
05:54:08,860 --> 05:54:10,280
I see you over there.

8316
05:54:11,500 --> 05:54:13,000
I hate that noise!

8317
05:54:13,200 --> 05:54:14,600
I think that's the worst part.

8318
05:54:15,100 --> 05:54:16,240
Is this noise.

8319
05:54:18,980 --> 05:54:19,500
Really?

8320
05:54:20,860 --> 05:54:21,380
Okay.

8321
05:54:23,060 --> 05:54:23,580
Oops.

8322
05:54:25,640 --> 05:54:26,380
There we go.

8323
05:54:27,160 --> 05:54:28,860
I think that's what I don't like.

8324
05:54:28,960 --> 05:54:29,200
Like...

8325
05:54:29,200 --> 05:54:31,500
Like the body bag.

8326
05:54:34,080 --> 05:54:35,340
Are you fucking...

8327
05:54:35,340 --> 05:54:35,560
Okay.

8328
05:54:36,460 --> 05:54:37,660
He bent his head.

8329
05:54:44,060 --> 05:54:45,620
That was unfortunate.

8330
05:54:46,420 --> 05:54:47,340
I didn't mean to...

8331
05:54:48,200 --> 05:54:49,360
There's no way that hits me.

8332
05:54:49,460 --> 05:54:49,860
Yeah, there's no way that hits me.

8333
05:54:49,860 --> 05:54:50,200
There's no way.

8334
05:54:52,540 --> 05:54:53,220
Okay.

8335
05:54:53,780 --> 05:54:55,040
I'll make sure.

8336
05:54:56,920 --> 05:54:57,760
God!

8337
05:54:57,760 --> 05:54:58,220
Bro!

8338
05:54:59,520 --> 05:55:02,760
God, I'm so anxious just listening to that!

8339
05:55:03,620 --> 05:55:04,040
The...

8340
05:55:04,040 --> 05:55:04,360
The...

8341
05:55:06,040 --> 05:55:09,180
It just makes me so fucking anxious.

8342
05:55:11,100 --> 05:55:11,940
The...

8343
05:55:11,940 --> 05:55:12,660
The...

8344
05:55:12,660 --> 05:55:13,040
The...

8345
05:55:14,380 --> 05:55:15,220
The...

8346
05:55:15,660 --> 05:55:16,080
The...

8347
05:55:20,580 --> 05:55:27,220
It's so annoying and I'm like just filled with anxiety just listening to the body bags.

8348
05:55:33,150 --> 05:55:33,870
Nice.

8349
05:55:35,250 --> 05:55:37,190
Oh, fucking hell!

8350
05:55:37,310 --> 05:55:38,110
Fuck that room!

8351
05:55:40,790 --> 05:55:42,450
The sound of chains!

8352
05:55:43,450 --> 05:55:44,970
Fioom fioom fioom fioom!

8353
05:55:48,190 --> 05:55:49,230
Oh, my God.

8354
05:55:50,170 --> 05:55:50,990
Here you go.

8355
05:55:51,050 --> 05:55:52,690
Here's your fucking spinettas.

8356
05:55:53,990 --> 05:55:55,190
Grab the staff!

8357
05:55:56,750 --> 05:55:57,570
Alright, nice.

8358
05:55:57,790 --> 05:55:59,450
And then I'll sell the viper too.

8359
05:55:59,570 --> 05:56:00,190
I don't need that.

8360
05:56:00,490 --> 05:56:01,510
Do I have a machine gun?

8361
05:56:01,710 --> 05:56:02,170
Yeah, I do.

8362
05:56:02,270 --> 05:56:03,190
I knew I had some.

8363
05:56:03,990 --> 05:56:06,870
I always have like submachine gun ammo for some reason.

8364
05:56:07,070 --> 05:56:07,750
I have an egg?

8365
05:56:08,290 --> 05:56:09,110
What do I do with it?

8366
05:56:09,170 --> 05:56:10,070
I guess I can eat the egg.

8367
05:56:12,630 --> 05:56:13,530
You don't need no...

8368
05:56:13,530 --> 05:56:14,850
No, I will kill them.

8369
05:56:15,350 --> 05:56:16,130
I don't care.

8370
05:56:16,850 --> 05:56:19,190
I will kill them no matter what.

8371
05:56:19,310 --> 05:56:20,130
Oh, I have enough money.

8372
05:56:21,870 --> 05:56:22,950
We'll upgrade this.

8373
05:56:23,330 --> 05:56:25,070
And then...

8374
05:56:25,070 --> 05:56:26,410
I might as well.

8375
05:56:28,010 --> 05:56:28,490
Yeah.

8376
05:56:28,870 --> 05:56:30,310
I fully upgrade my shotgun.

8377
05:56:31,450 --> 05:56:31,930
Okay.

8378
05:56:33,010 --> 05:56:35,830
And then I guess after that...

8379
05:56:36,750 --> 05:56:37,970
We can save a little bit.

8380
05:56:39,410 --> 05:56:40,750
Oh, my God.

8381
05:56:44,610 --> 05:56:46,590
Oh, my God.

8382
05:56:46,590 --> 05:56:46,990
Here we go.

8383
05:56:47,470 --> 05:56:48,050
Here we go!

8384
05:56:48,050 --> 05:56:48,290
I'm ready!

8385
05:56:49,470 --> 05:56:50,050
Reload!

8386
05:56:52,350 --> 05:56:52,930
Reload!

8387
05:56:53,850 --> 05:56:54,430
Hello?

8388
05:56:54,710 --> 05:56:57,010
I swear to God if there's more body bags...

8389
05:56:57,010 --> 05:56:58,810
I swear to fucking God.

8390
05:56:59,190 --> 05:57:01,070
I cannot deal with this.

8391
05:57:01,210 --> 05:57:01,790
I cannot.

8392
05:57:03,270 --> 05:57:04,330
Ashley, please.

8393
05:57:05,110 --> 05:57:06,110
Are you- Where?

8394
05:57:06,630 --> 05:57:07,010
Oh.

8395
05:57:07,610 --> 05:57:08,490
Oh, bug!

8396
05:57:08,490 --> 05:57:08,710
Bug!

8397
05:57:08,710 --> 05:57:09,810
Okay, bug is fine.

8398
05:57:09,950 --> 05:57:10,350
I'm fine.

8399
05:57:11,750 --> 05:57:12,410
He's fine.

8400
05:57:12,690 --> 05:57:13,490
Bug is fine!

8401
05:57:14,590 --> 05:57:16,050
Bug, I don't care as much.

8402
05:57:22,760 --> 05:57:24,320
So you're like... okay.

8403
05:57:25,660 --> 05:57:26,100
What?!

8404
05:57:27,160 --> 05:57:29,300
Man, I was gonna say, that's fucked up.

8405
05:57:32,000 --> 05:57:32,440
Okay.

8406
05:57:32,440 --> 05:57:33,140
There you go.

8407
05:57:33,780 --> 05:57:36,980
Just gonna make sure I get rid of all of you guys first.

8408
05:57:37,380 --> 05:57:38,560
And also that mine.

8409
05:57:40,360 --> 05:57:41,040
There you go.

8410
05:57:42,060 --> 05:57:43,040
I don't know?

8411
05:57:43,240 --> 05:57:43,580
What?

8412
05:57:44,280 --> 05:57:45,360
What do I not know?

8413
05:57:45,460 --> 05:57:46,080
What, guys?

8414
05:57:48,480 --> 05:57:49,560
What do you mean?

8415
05:57:52,840 --> 05:57:54,460
What do you mean?

8416
05:57:55,020 --> 05:57:55,500
Chat!

8417
05:57:58,140 --> 05:57:59,260
What do you mean?

8418
05:57:59,400 --> 05:58:00,800
She doesn't know!

8419
05:58:01,080 --> 05:58:01,940
God damn it!

8420
05:58:02,760 --> 05:58:03,800
Don't tell it.

8421
05:58:03,840 --> 05:58:04,720
What do you...

8422
05:58:04,720 --> 05:58:05,620
What?!

8423
05:58:06,700 --> 05:58:07,680
I don't like this.

8424
05:58:08,560 --> 05:58:09,580
I don't like this.

8425
05:58:11,040 --> 05:58:12,860
I don't like how you're like, she doesn't know.

8426
05:58:14,320 --> 05:58:16,700
I don't like this at all.

8427
05:58:18,980 --> 05:58:20,780
I don't like what that implies.

8428
05:58:22,440 --> 05:58:23,900
Why wouldn't I know?

8429
05:58:27,650 --> 05:58:29,530
Why wouldn't I know, chat?

8430
05:58:36,650 --> 05:58:38,250
This is terrible.

8431
05:58:38,530 --> 05:58:39,850
This is really terrible.

8432
05:58:41,190 --> 05:58:43,410
I hate this so much.

8433
05:58:45,570 --> 05:58:46,590
Oh no.

8434
05:58:46,690 --> 05:58:48,390
Where the fuck is the rocket launcher, man?

8435
05:58:49,190 --> 05:58:50,670
Oh, I got the fish at least.

8436
05:58:51,270 --> 05:58:52,270
I got fish.

8437
05:58:52,970 --> 05:58:54,130
I got fish.

8438
05:58:57,590 --> 05:58:59,070
It's not important.

8439
05:58:59,790 --> 05:59:01,050
What do you mean?

8440
05:59:01,130 --> 05:59:02,510
I feel like it's very important!

8441
05:59:05,650 --> 05:59:07,010
Give me a break already.

8442
05:59:07,350 --> 05:59:09,050
I feel like it's so important!

8443
05:59:10,090 --> 05:59:10,630
Wow!

8444
05:59:13,470 --> 05:59:14,010
I'm so sorry.

8445
05:59:14,030 --> 05:59:14,730
How?!

8446
05:59:15,610 --> 05:59:16,630
Bro, I can't.

8447
05:59:20,610 --> 05:59:21,370
Oh my god!

8448
05:59:21,390 --> 05:59:22,430
That's where you were!

8449
05:59:22,710 --> 05:59:25,090
Oh, my armor does not look so well.

8450
05:59:25,170 --> 05:59:28,770
I don't feel fine.

8451
05:59:28,890 --> 05:59:30,010
I do not feel fine.

8452
05:59:30,130 --> 05:59:31,710
I do not feel fine at all.

8453
05:59:36,850 --> 05:59:37,450
Let's see.

8454
05:59:37,570 --> 05:59:39,090
I'm just gonna make sure there's no bugs here.

8455
05:59:41,270 --> 05:59:42,190
I mean, eventually.

8456
05:59:42,490 --> 05:59:42,850
You know what?

8457
05:59:42,890 --> 05:59:43,350
Fuck it.

8458
05:59:44,650 --> 05:59:46,010
I can't care enough.

8459
05:59:46,010 --> 05:59:47,190
I can't care enough.

8460
05:59:48,730 --> 05:59:49,370
Oh, fuck.

8461
05:59:50,090 --> 05:59:51,870
Look at all these iron gun ammo.

8462
05:59:54,410 --> 05:59:56,290
All will be revealed?

8463
05:59:56,970 --> 05:59:57,610
All will be revealed?

8464
05:59:57,610 --> 05:59:58,750
Oh, guys.

8465
06:00:01,090 --> 06:00:02,370
Oh, guys.

8466
06:00:03,270 --> 06:00:03,910
Oh, guys.

8467
06:00:03,910 --> 06:00:06,610
But what if I want you to reveal it now?

8468
06:00:10,780 --> 06:00:13,160
Is that not a fucking beeper?

8469
06:00:13,520 --> 06:00:13,580
Is that not a fucking beeper?

8470
06:00:15,260 --> 06:00:17,500
I swear to fucking god.

8471
06:00:17,560 --> 06:00:17,760
I swear to fucking god.

8472
06:00:17,760 --> 06:00:18,280
I swear to fucking god.

8473
06:00:19,740 --> 06:00:20,260
Alright.

8474
06:00:22,620 --> 06:00:23,620
Okay, it's time!

8475
06:00:24,760 --> 06:00:25,340
Grenade!

8476
06:00:25,520 --> 06:00:26,100
Oop!

8477
06:00:26,900 --> 06:00:27,480
Ow!

8478
06:00:28,180 --> 06:00:29,140
Alright, here we go.

8479
06:00:31,820 --> 06:00:32,540
It's okay.

8480
06:00:32,620 --> 06:00:32,980
We're fine.

8481
06:00:34,480 --> 06:00:35,740
We used our grenades.

8482
06:00:37,560 --> 06:00:38,860
We're using our grenades!

8483
06:00:39,280 --> 06:00:40,060
That's good!

8484
06:00:41,180 --> 06:00:42,280
That's so good!

8485
06:00:45,120 --> 06:00:45,700
Next.

8486
06:00:45,700 --> 06:00:45,980
Next.

8487
06:00:47,980 --> 06:00:49,360
Oh my god, please.

8488
06:00:49,400 --> 06:00:50,080
I have so much ammo.

8489
06:00:50,680 --> 06:00:51,120
Oop!

8490
06:00:52,780 --> 06:00:55,260
Alright, nice.

8491
06:00:57,960 --> 06:00:58,400
Alright.

8492
06:00:58,580 --> 06:00:59,380
We got the head.

8493
06:00:59,860 --> 06:01:01,700
We got the...

8494
06:01:03,420 --> 06:01:03,860
Okay.

8495
06:01:04,520 --> 06:01:05,560
Please give me more.

8496
06:01:07,380 --> 06:01:07,820
Nice.

8497
06:01:08,780 --> 06:01:09,980
Give me a break already.

8498
06:01:10,320 --> 06:01:10,620
It's fine.

8499
06:01:10,700 --> 06:01:11,040
It's fine.

8500
06:01:11,120 --> 06:01:11,740
We're doing it!

8501
06:01:12,680 --> 06:01:13,480
We're surviving!

8502
06:01:15,100 --> 06:01:15,680
Stop it!

8503
06:01:17,500 --> 06:01:18,660
I told you.

8504
06:01:18,900 --> 06:01:19,780
We're survivors.

8505
06:01:21,820 --> 06:01:23,600
Now we can go in here.

8506
06:01:25,460 --> 06:01:26,620
Holy shit.

8507
06:01:26,660 --> 06:01:28,000
There's so many enemies.

8508
06:01:28,120 --> 06:01:30,640
I feel like I should have been stealthing this entire time.

8509
06:01:36,360 --> 06:01:37,460
Holy fuck.

8510
06:01:38,440 --> 06:01:39,720
If this was...

8511
06:01:39,720 --> 06:01:45,120
If this was stealth, I would not have to worry about all these fucking people.

8512
06:01:45,220 --> 06:01:45,680
I would not have to worry about all these fucking people.

8513
06:01:48,420 --> 06:01:49,640
Get out.

8514
06:01:49,680 --> 06:01:50,880
Get outta here.

8515
06:01:53,960 --> 06:01:55,700
Oh my god.

8516
06:01:56,260 --> 06:01:58,420
Get the fuck outta here.

8517
06:02:00,400 --> 06:02:02,840
Oh, if only we had Mike!

8518
06:02:03,320 --> 06:02:04,580
Where's Mike?

8519
06:02:06,820 --> 06:02:08,400
I miss Mike.

8520
06:02:08,680 --> 06:02:10,620
I miss him so much.

8521
06:02:14,260 --> 06:02:15,680
Mike, what happened?

8522
06:02:15,680 --> 06:02:16,980
Mike, you're the one that fucking saved me.

8523
06:02:18,920 --> 06:02:20,080
What the fuck?

8524
06:02:22,260 --> 06:02:22,780
Nice.

8525
06:02:24,640 --> 06:02:25,160
There.

8526
06:02:25,340 --> 06:02:27,840
Yeah, my fucking sniper is so tanky.

8527
06:02:28,260 --> 06:02:29,500
Holy shit.

8528
06:02:30,020 --> 06:02:32,060
I like two-shot this man.

8529
06:02:33,760 --> 06:02:34,280
Just...

8530
06:02:34,900 --> 06:02:35,420
No!

8531
06:02:35,960 --> 06:02:37,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

8532
06:02:39,120 --> 06:02:39,840
Oh god.

8533
06:02:39,940 --> 06:02:40,480
Oh god.

8534
06:02:40,620 --> 06:02:40,880
Oh.

8535
06:02:43,360 --> 06:02:43,880
Okay.

8536
06:02:44,160 --> 06:02:44,840
That's fine.

8537
06:02:45,040 --> 06:02:45,660
Oh, that's fine.

8538
06:02:45,680 --> 06:02:46,380
This is not fine.

8539
06:02:46,440 --> 06:02:47,060
This is not fine!

8540
06:02:47,100 --> 06:02:48,160
Where did you come from?

8541
06:02:52,280 --> 06:02:53,240
Jesus Christ!

8542
06:02:56,560 --> 06:02:57,460
Oh god!

8543
06:02:57,660 --> 06:02:58,320
Oh, this is...

8544
06:03:01,730 --> 06:03:02,890
This is not good!

8545
06:03:11,270 --> 06:03:11,750
Okay.

8546
06:03:13,670 --> 06:03:14,390
Alright, we're good.

8547
06:03:15,030 --> 06:03:15,790
We're okay.

8548
06:03:15,950 --> 06:03:16,830
We're okay.

8549
06:03:18,750 --> 06:03:19,810
Oh, we're okay.

8550
06:03:20,190 --> 06:03:20,990
We're okay.

8551
06:03:21,850 --> 06:03:22,810
We're okay.

8552
06:03:22,910 --> 06:03:23,470
We lived.

8553
06:03:23,850 --> 06:03:24,630
We lived.

8554
06:03:24,770 --> 06:03:25,430
We're okay.

8555
06:03:25,910 --> 06:03:27,230
We are alive.

8556
06:03:27,950 --> 06:03:29,230
We are alive.

8557
06:03:30,350 --> 06:03:30,950
Lure.

8558
06:03:32,010 --> 06:03:33,410
Give me all the loot.

8559
06:03:36,410 --> 06:03:37,450
Holy shit.

8560
06:03:37,510 --> 06:03:37,970
Thank you.

8561
06:03:37,990 --> 06:03:39,190
Thank you for all the ammo.

8562
06:03:40,130 --> 06:03:41,370
I'm so poor.

8563
06:03:43,930 --> 06:03:44,830
Thank god.

8564
06:03:45,970 --> 06:03:47,030
Not panicking.

8565
06:03:47,090 --> 06:03:47,790
I'm not panicking.

8566
06:03:48,150 --> 06:03:50,350
I am very calm.

8567
06:03:51,010 --> 06:03:51,910
Turn off.

8568
06:03:52,830 --> 06:03:54,890
I'm so fucking calm right now.

8569
06:03:55,290 --> 06:03:55,890
I'm so fucking calm right now.

8570
06:03:57,270 --> 06:03:57,950
Okay.

8571
06:03:58,050 --> 06:03:58,950
We gotta go this way.

8572
06:03:59,970 --> 06:04:01,090
Down I go.

8573
06:04:02,090 --> 06:04:03,570
Down I go.

8574
06:04:04,730 --> 06:04:06,190
We're so calm.

8575
06:04:06,390 --> 06:04:08,710
We need more fucking shotgun ammo.

8576
06:04:10,430 --> 06:04:12,410
We're so fucking calm.

8577
06:04:12,790 --> 06:04:13,230
We're so fucking calm.

8578
06:04:16,950 --> 06:04:17,630
We're so fucking calm.

8579
06:04:18,030 --> 06:04:19,410
We made it here.

8580
06:04:19,970 --> 06:04:21,750
We made it so far.

8581
06:04:23,210 --> 06:04:24,110
Wait, what?

8582
06:04:25,130 --> 06:04:25,810
Why?

8583
06:04:25,810 --> 06:04:26,030
Why?

8584
06:04:26,870 --> 06:04:28,190
What if I just press this?

8585
06:04:31,910 --> 06:04:32,450
What?

8586
06:04:32,750 --> 06:04:33,290
Okay.

8587
06:04:35,250 --> 06:04:35,790
Okay.

8588
06:04:39,150 --> 06:04:40,270
I'm so calm.

8589
06:04:41,530 --> 06:04:42,650
I'm so calm.

8590
06:04:46,020 --> 06:04:48,960
I am so very calm.

8591
06:04:50,080 --> 06:04:51,060
Oh my god.

8592
06:04:51,080 --> 06:04:52,580
My HP was not very calm.

8593
06:04:53,380 --> 06:04:56,620
My HP was like not calm at all.

8594
06:04:57,500 --> 06:04:58,140
Okay.

8595
06:04:58,300 --> 06:04:58,880
Let's see.

8596
06:04:58,940 --> 06:04:59,240
Let's go.

8597
06:05:00,900 --> 06:05:01,540
Hello?

8598
06:05:02,720 --> 06:05:03,900
Oh man.

8599
06:05:04,260 --> 06:05:05,620
Why does that look like that?

8600
06:05:06,700 --> 06:05:08,320
Why does it look like that?

8601
06:05:08,760 --> 06:05:09,400
Oh.

8602
06:05:09,400 --> 06:05:10,100
Come on.

8603
06:05:11,300 --> 06:05:12,600
Go after Ashley?

8604
06:05:16,580 --> 06:05:19,060
What if I don't Adam.

8605
06:05:19,320 --> 06:05:20,300
Adam and Eve?

8606
06:05:24,510 --> 06:05:25,150
Oh.

8607
06:05:25,970 --> 06:05:26,610
Oh.

8608
06:05:27,890 --> 06:05:28,530
Ashley.

8609
06:05:28,630 --> 06:05:28,650
Ashley.

8610
06:05:32,750 --> 06:05:33,390
Ashley...

8611
06:05:36,510 --> 06:05:37,150
Ashley...

8612
06:05:44,560 --> 06:05:45,200
Ashley...

8613
06:05:45,200 --> 06:05:46,020
Oh, Adam sadly!

8614
06:05:48,000 --> 06:05:53,240
I simply wish to share this gift with as many as possible.

8615
06:05:54,240 --> 06:05:56,240
A humble wish, don't you think?

8616
06:05:57,520 --> 06:06:01,800
You see, we are all connected through the Holy Body.

8617
06:06:20,300 --> 06:06:22,300
Bro, what if I just let you keep Ashley?

8618
06:06:22,460 --> 06:06:23,180
Can I just leave?

8619
06:06:41,760 --> 06:06:44,560
Oh shit!

8620
06:06:51,520 --> 06:06:53,180
I'm okay!

8621
06:06:53,500 --> 06:06:55,020
This butterfly!

8622
06:06:55,220 --> 06:06:55,940
Scratch!

8623
06:06:57,260 --> 06:06:58,420
Oh my... Ada!

8624
06:06:58,520 --> 06:06:59,880
You could have done this earlier, Ada!

8625
06:07:01,900 --> 06:07:03,240
Oh no!

8626
06:07:04,580 --> 06:07:06,020
Oh no!

8627
06:07:13,670 --> 06:07:16,070
Why am I carrying her?

8628
06:07:17,930 --> 06:07:19,370
Oh no!

8629
06:07:28,550 --> 06:07:29,970
Ashley, wake up!

8630
06:07:30,150 --> 06:07:30,790
Ashley!

8631
06:07:30,970 --> 06:07:32,010
Wake up!

8632
06:07:36,950 --> 06:07:38,070
Ashley, please!

8633
06:07:38,450 --> 06:07:39,150
Please!

8634
06:07:39,270 --> 06:07:40,690
Wake up, Ashley!

8635
06:07:46,570 --> 06:07:47,750
Ashley, no!

8636
06:07:48,430 --> 06:07:49,610
No, Ashley!

8637
06:07:50,930 --> 06:07:52,250
Ashley, no!

8638
06:07:56,190 --> 06:08:00,130
Ashley, wake up!

8639
06:08:00,170 --> 06:08:01,470
Wake up, Ashley, please!

8640
06:08:01,470 --> 06:08:02,870
Please, Ashley!

8641
06:08:03,570 --> 06:08:04,250
Please!

8642
06:08:06,710 --> 06:08:07,750
Ashley, please!

8643
06:08:07,870 --> 06:08:08,750
You're so heavy!

8644
06:08:10,370 --> 06:08:11,510
I'm losing it!

8645
06:08:11,730 --> 06:08:12,030
I'm losing it!

8646
06:08:15,230 --> 06:08:16,190
I'm losing it!

8647
06:08:16,190 --> 06:08:17,070
Oh no!

8648
06:08:21,010 --> 06:08:21,690
No!

8649
06:08:22,130 --> 06:08:22,810
No!

8650
06:08:23,150 --> 06:08:24,170
Oh no!

8651
06:08:26,010 --> 06:08:27,250
What is this?

8652
06:08:30,870 --> 06:08:33,470
Still you resist, child.

8653
06:08:33,590 --> 06:08:34,070
Still you resist, child.

8654
06:08:34,070 --> 06:08:34,750
Run!

8655
06:08:36,890 --> 06:08:37,610
Let's go!

8656
06:08:43,660 --> 06:08:44,380
Huh?

8657
06:08:49,940 --> 06:08:51,200
What do I do?

8658
06:08:51,880 --> 06:08:54,120
Go towards the light...

8659
06:08:55,520 --> 06:08:57,780
Just go towards the light!

8660
06:08:58,240 --> 06:08:58,640
No!

8661
06:08:59,360 --> 06:09:01,800
Just go towards the light!

8662
06:09:04,120 --> 06:09:04,980
I'm already ...

8663
06:09:04,980 --> 06:09:05,160
Go Leah!

8664
06:09:05,280 --> 06:09:06,160
Go faster!

8665
06:09:07,380 --> 06:09:08,600
God damn it!

8666
06:09:09,480 --> 06:09:10,360
Liam, please!

8667
06:09:10,440 --> 06:09:11,420
She's not that heavy!

8668
06:09:11,420 --> 06:09:13,280
She's like a fucking teenager!

8669
06:09:13,940 --> 06:09:16,580
I don't fucking know, just go faster.

8670
06:09:17,160 --> 06:09:18,580
Leon, please!

8671
06:09:20,860 --> 06:09:22,080
You're tired?

8672
06:09:28,140 --> 06:09:33,040
You were never tired when you were fucking running for 20 years!

8673
06:09:37,910 --> 06:09:40,890
Oh my god, I have the one key.

8674
06:09:41,750 --> 06:09:43,230
Ashley, too heavy.

8675
06:09:45,110 --> 06:09:46,630
Oh, holy shit.

8676
06:09:47,830 --> 06:09:49,190
Get in there, Ashley.

8677
06:09:53,830 --> 06:09:55,410
Get in there.

8678
06:09:56,070 --> 06:09:57,690
Get in there, sit in that chair.

8679
06:09:58,310 --> 06:10:00,230
Sit in the fucking chair!

8680
06:10:17,940 --> 06:10:19,100
Get in there!

8681
06:10:19,580 --> 06:10:20,120
Get in the robot, Ashley.

8682
06:10:23,320 --> 06:10:24,800
Don't worry, it's not gonna hurt.

8683
06:10:25,040 --> 06:10:29,160
We have no morphine to help you not feel pain.

8684
06:10:32,440 --> 06:10:34,140
Close your eyes, Ashley.

8685
06:10:34,860 --> 06:10:35,960
It won't hurt.

8686
06:10:36,020 --> 06:10:37,660
It's only gonna hurt a little.

8687
06:10:38,060 --> 06:10:38,240
Just a little bit.

8688
06:10:39,890 --> 06:10:41,120
We're gonna shoot the bug?

8689
06:10:41,830 --> 06:10:43,420
Ooooh, god!

8690
06:10:46,580 --> 06:10:49,560
Bro, that's like so close to her heart!

8691
06:10:50,300 --> 06:10:55,900
We did

8692
06:11:01,780 --> 06:11:02,260
it, yay!

8693
06:11:04,140 --> 06:11:05,200
You're okay.

8694
06:11:19,960 --> 06:11:20,590
The end.

8695
06:11:20,930 --> 06:11:24,570
And thus Leon could never continue the bloodline.

8696
06:11:25,350 --> 06:11:26,770
Oh my god.

8697
06:11:26,930 --> 06:11:27,630
Oh my god.

8698
06:11:27,630 --> 06:11:28,950
That level fucking sucked.

8699
06:11:34,770 --> 06:11:37,370
That level was fucking terrible.

8700
06:11:37,850 --> 06:11:39,530
That had to be the worst chapter.

8701
06:11:40,510 --> 06:11:42,550
That actually was the worst chapter.

8702
06:11:55,950 --> 06:11:57,930
Not the bloodline.

8703
06:12:04,050 --> 06:12:05,730
Bro, she healed up so fast.

8704
06:12:07,990 --> 06:12:11,570
I like how Leon gets to have the procedure while he's unconscious.

8705
06:12:14,170 --> 06:12:18,070
He had the privilege of being unconscious for this entire thing.

8706
06:12:30,460 --> 06:12:33,260
Oh yeah, how the fuck did Ashley put him on the chair?

8707
06:12:34,020 --> 06:12:34,920
Bro, what the fuck?

8708
06:12:34,940 --> 06:12:35,520
Fuck Ashley.

8709
06:12:36,080 --> 06:12:37,840
We're fucking jacked.

8710
06:12:38,480 --> 06:12:39,420
Removing the parasites.

8711
06:12:40,700 --> 06:12:43,220
There are two ways to eradicate Las Plagas.

8712
06:12:43,600 --> 06:12:44,980
Antigen injection and surgery.

8713
06:12:45,420 --> 06:12:50,020
If the parasite is not hatched yet, it can be treated by administrating antigen directly into the body.

8714
06:12:50,180 --> 06:12:53,940
Once it is hatched, however, there's not much that can be done besides slow its growth.

8715
06:12:54,900 --> 06:13:00,100
With surgery, the plasma can be targeted and killed using a certain wavelength of radiation.

8716
06:13:01,140 --> 06:13:02,100
That is...

8717
06:13:03,100 --> 06:13:04,720
That was a lot of radiation.

8718
06:13:04,720 --> 06:13:05,080
That was a lot of radiation.

8719
06:13:05,140 --> 06:13:06,760
Near the fucking heart!

8720
06:13:07,880 --> 06:13:09,140
This is not without its risk.

8721
06:13:09,220 --> 06:13:09,860
Oh shit, yeah?

8722
06:13:10,240 --> 06:13:14,820
This parasite has attached itself to the host's nervous system.

8723
06:13:15,040 --> 06:13:17,320
The host will experience excruciating pain.

8724
06:13:17,700 --> 06:13:21,440
And there is no effective anesthesia for this kind of procedure.

8725
06:13:22,880 --> 06:13:28,360
Surgical removal carries considerable risk even before the parasite is fully developed.

8726
06:13:28,720 --> 06:13:33,860
Once fully grown, however, if it is too late, removing the parasite will kill the host.

8727
06:13:33,860 --> 06:13:35,680
But considering what will happen to them...

8728
06:13:35,680 --> 06:13:37,620
Death may be a mercy.

8729
06:13:38,200 --> 06:13:38,520
Adüss!

8730
06:13:42,280 --> 06:13:43,480
Thank you, Luis.

8731
06:13:43,820 --> 06:13:45,300
He's alive, too, by the way!

8732
06:13:45,480 --> 06:13:49,240
There's Luis!!!

8733
06:13:49,240 --> 06:13:49,740
Yo!

8734
06:13:53,300 --> 06:13:56,300
I bet the guy that opened that umbrella is fucking dead.

8735
06:13:58,340 --> 06:13:59,200
Alright, what's this?

8736
06:13:59,360 --> 06:14:01,600
To be not be fooled into thinking that..

8737
06:14:01,600 --> 06:14:03,840
Las Plagas are merely tools for protecting...

8738
06:14:28,040 --> 06:14:30,140
We have empowered Saddler.

8739
06:14:30,300 --> 06:14:32,500
It is clear what he intends to do next.

8740
06:14:33,860 --> 06:14:35,820
Can you imagine if Saddler had that much control?

8741
06:14:36,200 --> 06:14:39,420
Six billion loyal servants at his sole command.

8742
06:14:39,780 --> 06:14:41,040
There will be no opposition.

8743
06:14:41,400 --> 06:14:42,100
No war.

8744
06:14:42,360 --> 06:14:43,060
That's not bad.

8745
06:14:43,500 --> 06:14:44,080
No war.

8746
06:14:44,880 --> 06:14:46,720
Maybe for the first time in human history...

8747
06:14:46,720 --> 06:14:47,180
Yeah, see?

8748
06:14:47,460 --> 06:14:49,580
In human history, the world will know peace.

8749
06:14:50,200 --> 06:14:53,920
But I know how Saddler and the others have oppressed the people of this island for generations.

8750
06:14:54,400 --> 06:14:56,200
I know how he treats them.

8751
06:14:56,380 --> 06:14:57,780
There's no way to live.

8752
06:14:58,040 --> 06:15:00,320
And because of that, I won't let it happen.

8753
06:15:03,220 --> 06:15:04,500
Yeah, but like...

8754
06:15:04,500 --> 06:15:06,100
Not the most uncomfortable place I've seen before.

8755
06:15:06,100 --> 06:15:09,040
But like, if it's like one person, you know, like one...

8756
06:15:09,040 --> 06:15:11,240
Like, you wouldn't care when you get control.

8757
06:15:11,680 --> 06:15:12,440
These drugs just didn't even boot it up.

8758
06:15:12,960 --> 06:15:15,320
Oh god, you know how old this PC is.

8759
06:15:15,460 --> 06:15:16,020
What the fuck?

8760
06:15:16,060 --> 06:15:17,500
Look how thick that PC is.

8761
06:15:18,780 --> 06:15:20,020
Look how thick it is.

8762
06:15:20,720 --> 06:15:25,060
This sample, which I've come to call the Yamber, was just sitting in the storeroom collecting dust.

8763
06:15:25,460 --> 06:15:29,080
We used to have ample specimens for experimentation in the past.

8764
06:15:29,080 --> 06:15:31,260
So it makes sense that this one was overlooked.

8765
06:15:31,700 --> 06:15:36,420
In fact, the only reason I brought it back in my lab was because of its peculiar shape.

8766
06:15:37,000 --> 06:15:39,800
After a basic analysis, I've changed my mind.

8767
06:15:40,340 --> 06:15:42,660
The Yamber possesses a very unique quality.

8768
06:15:43,180 --> 06:15:51,320
Although small and in a suspended state, it contains the same organ found in a dominant species, which we've only seen in Saddler himself.

8769
06:15:51,800 --> 06:15:56,960
When fully developed, the Yamber may rival or perhaps even surpass Saddler's power.

8770
06:15:57,060 --> 06:15:57,920
Oh, this is the one!

8771
06:15:57,920 --> 06:16:01,060
This was the one that was in Ashley!

8772
06:16:02,000 --> 06:16:07,480
Unfortunately, the Yamber was confiscated by Saddler before I could make any further progress in my research.

8773
06:16:07,760 --> 06:16:09,080
He may be onto me.

8774
06:16:09,220 --> 06:16:14,380
I need to get my hands on that sample again and escape in order to continue my research elsewhere.

8775
06:16:14,740 --> 06:16:16,760
It's the only way to counter Saddler.

8776
06:16:17,260 --> 06:16:20,700
Of course, I don't think I can trust this outside group either.

8777
06:16:20,920 --> 06:16:22,780
But I've already come this far.

8778
06:16:23,200 --> 06:16:25,940
Hopefully, I can sweet-talk my way out of this one too.

8779
06:16:26,240 --> 06:16:27,080
I'll have to.

8780
06:16:27,080 --> 06:16:28,520
For the world's sake.

8781
06:16:28,740 --> 06:16:29,800
Jesus Christ!

8782
06:16:30,580 --> 06:16:31,340
Lewis!

8783
06:16:31,460 --> 06:16:33,400
Keep all your notes in one area!

8784
06:16:39,840 --> 06:16:41,660
Lewis, why are your notes...

8785
06:16:41,660 --> 06:16:44,220
...fucking spread to like four PCs?

8786
06:16:49,760 --> 06:16:53,160
All of Lewis's notes are scattered everywhere.

8787
06:16:54,840 --> 06:16:57,240
Keep it in one PC, Lewis!

8788
06:17:01,040 --> 06:17:02,440
Alright, here we go.

8789
06:17:03,020 --> 06:17:04,360
I like this.

8790
06:17:05,960 --> 06:17:06,480
Get up.

8791
06:17:08,080 --> 06:17:09,860
The chink office.

8792
06:17:15,840 --> 06:17:16,560
Alright.

8793
06:17:16,920 --> 06:17:18,680
No way they're healthier.

8794
06:17:19,180 --> 06:17:20,260
I'll be right back.

8795
06:17:22,440 --> 06:17:23,820
Do not get kidnapped.

8796
06:17:23,880 --> 06:17:25,400
I swear to fucking God.

8797
06:17:29,580 --> 06:17:31,160
I swear to God.

8798
06:17:31,540 --> 06:17:34,320
Do not get kidnapped while I grab this.

8799
06:17:35,580 --> 06:17:36,340
There you go.

8800
06:17:38,940 --> 06:17:39,460
Yeah.

8801
06:17:39,580 --> 06:17:40,380
Go up.

8802
06:17:44,340 --> 06:17:46,240
Yeah, it was 30 seconds last time.

8803
06:17:46,300 --> 06:17:47,240
I just don't trust her.

8804
06:17:48,120 --> 06:17:49,740
I don't trust her at all.

8805
06:17:54,590 --> 06:17:55,810
Oh, I'm so fine.

8806
06:17:57,030 --> 06:17:58,150
I'm so okay.

8807
06:17:58,210 --> 06:17:59,950
Just a little radiation in my heart.

8808
06:18:00,930 --> 06:18:01,610
That's okay.

8809
06:18:04,250 --> 06:18:05,230
Doesn't hurt nobody.

8810
06:18:08,810 --> 06:18:09,250
Yeah.

8811
06:18:09,630 --> 06:18:10,670
Oh, no.

8812
06:18:11,090 --> 06:18:13,370
Why do I have to bring out my rifle?

8813
06:18:19,580 --> 06:18:20,020
Why?

8814
06:18:23,100 --> 06:18:24,320
This is where you died.

8815
06:18:25,080 --> 06:18:26,180
Do you think she's alright?

8816
06:18:27,800 --> 06:18:29,040
Oh, I'm sure she's fine.

8817
06:18:29,940 --> 06:18:31,900
She's not the type to roll over that easy.

8818
06:18:33,000 --> 06:18:33,960
Yeah, don't worry.

8819
06:18:34,200 --> 06:18:37,080
The effects will show up in like 10 to 15 years.

8820
06:18:37,360 --> 06:18:39,520
And maybe by then we'll find the cure.

8821
06:18:40,080 --> 06:18:41,000
Right, Ashley?

8822
06:18:41,720 --> 06:18:42,280
Yeah.

8823
06:18:45,360 --> 06:18:45,700
Yeah.

8824
06:18:46,140 --> 06:18:46,620
Yeah.

8825
06:18:55,290 --> 06:18:55,850
Yeah.

8826
06:18:57,710 --> 06:18:58,270
Yeah.

8827
06:18:59,870 --> 06:19:00,430
Yeah.

8828
06:19:00,850 --> 06:19:01,410
Yeah.

8829
06:19:02,450 --> 06:19:03,010
Yeah.

8830
06:19:04,510 --> 06:19:05,070
Yeah.

8831
06:19:07,950 --> 06:19:08,630
What cure?

8832
06:19:08,790 --> 06:19:09,510
I don't know.

8833
06:19:09,530 --> 06:19:13,070
What do you guys think is gonna happen when you have all that radiation in your heart, chat?

8834
06:19:14,950 --> 06:19:16,350
Do I really need that treasure?

8835
06:19:17,610 --> 06:19:18,850
Do I care enough?

8836
06:19:23,430 --> 06:19:27,350
Do I really care enough about that fucking treasure, chat?

8837
06:19:29,050 --> 06:19:29,530
Fine.

8838
06:19:30,370 --> 06:19:31,250
Super heart?

8839
06:19:31,530 --> 06:19:33,130
That's how you get super powers.

8840
06:19:33,190 --> 06:19:34,250
You don't understand.

8841
06:19:42,700 --> 06:19:43,180
Super heart?

8842
06:19:43,180 --> 06:19:43,180
That's how you get super powers.

8843
06:19:43,180 --> 06:19:43,180
You don't understand.

8844
06:19:43,280 --> 06:19:44,820
That's how super powers work.

8845
06:19:47,440 --> 06:19:48,480
Wait, which one was it?

8846
06:19:48,560 --> 06:19:48,720
Is it?

8847
06:19:49,220 --> 06:19:51,460
Okay, it's this.

8848
06:19:51,520 --> 06:19:52,440
This is what I'm looking at.

8849
06:19:52,480 --> 06:19:52,900
There we go.

8850
06:19:53,320 --> 06:19:54,420
Yeah, what the fuck?

8851
06:19:54,500 --> 06:19:55,840
I swear I shot that.

8852
06:19:58,460 --> 06:19:58,860
Okay.

8853
06:20:01,000 --> 06:20:02,340
That superhero's taught us.

8854
06:20:02,980 --> 06:20:04,460
Please do not... guys.

8855
06:20:04,920 --> 06:20:07,040
I don't think that's what's gonna happen.

8856
06:20:09,540 --> 06:20:11,300
Praise be to the holy inside...

8857
06:20:11,860 --> 06:20:13,260
Lord Kuros is thinking of his soul.

8858
06:20:13,280 --> 06:20:14,240
Super chat, thank you, thank you.

8859
06:20:14,280 --> 06:20:15,080
Super powers.

8860
06:20:15,220 --> 06:20:18,680
How else do you explain Chris Redfield's ability to punch boulders?

8861
06:20:19,020 --> 06:20:20,980
Women promise paradise on earth.

8862
06:20:21,240 --> 06:20:23,220
Man, women, or child.

8863
06:20:23,440 --> 06:20:24,860
His love does not discriminate.

8864
06:20:25,440 --> 06:20:27,280
Beast, fish, or bird.

8865
06:20:27,520 --> 06:20:28,560
Or creature.

8866
06:20:28,660 --> 06:20:30,340
All creatures shall be equally blessed.

8867
06:20:30,760 --> 06:20:33,100
Praise be to the holy insects.

8868
06:20:33,520 --> 06:20:35,780
We are the humble servants of God.

8869
06:20:36,140 --> 06:20:39,000
His wisdom will overcome any mountain.

8870
06:20:39,300 --> 06:20:42,900
His omnipotence will cross any ocean.

8871
06:20:43,280 --> 06:20:45,300
The light of heaven dwells in all things.

8872
06:20:45,580 --> 06:20:47,400
Let our bodies be seated.

8873
06:20:47,800 --> 06:20:50,140
Praise be to the holy insects.

8874
06:20:50,620 --> 06:20:53,440
We are the flock and the shepherd guides us.

8875
06:20:53,680 --> 06:20:56,420
Our prayers will be sung all over the world.

8876
06:20:56,900 --> 06:20:58,880
And they will be heard by all.

8877
06:20:59,220 --> 06:21:02,260
At last, we shall exceed in the stars.

8878
06:21:03,220 --> 06:21:04,060
Good time!

8879
06:21:05,180 --> 06:21:05,780
Yay!

8880
06:21:07,820 --> 06:21:09,200
Oh my god, Adam Sandler.

8881
06:21:09,340 --> 06:21:09,920
Big fan.

8882
06:21:11,640 --> 06:21:13,600
I love you and Hansel and Gretel.

8883
06:21:13,740 --> 06:21:15,600
I actually watched that movie.

8884
06:21:22,080 --> 06:21:24,380
I actually watched it.

8885
06:21:24,440 --> 06:21:27,560
I watched that twin movie from Adam Sandler.

8886
06:21:31,150 --> 06:21:32,210
No way.

8887
06:21:32,870 --> 06:21:34,050
Unfortunately, yes.

8888
06:21:35,670 --> 06:21:37,410
Unfortunately, yes way.

8889
06:21:41,410 --> 06:21:45,150
I have watched a lot of really bad movies.

8890
06:21:48,120 --> 06:21:52,530
And I mean a lot of bad movies.

8891
06:21:54,210 --> 06:21:54,990
Why?

8892
06:21:55,550 --> 06:21:57,890
Look, I watched...

8893
06:21:57,890 --> 06:22:04,110
I paid for movie tickets to like movies that I should not have paid for.

8894
06:22:06,690 --> 06:22:12,210
Because like back in those days, you would see the trailers on TV and stuff.

8895
06:22:12,370 --> 06:22:15,610
And all you're thinking was like, it can't be that bad.

8896
06:22:16,170 --> 06:22:16,630
Whoa!

8897
06:22:16,850 --> 06:22:24,510
And then like you and your parents would just be like the one of the ten people at the theater watching that movie.

8898
06:22:24,790 --> 06:22:26,590
There was this movie with...

8899
06:22:26,590 --> 06:22:27,410
God, what was it?

8900
06:22:27,490 --> 06:22:30,150
Like this like alien race controlling like a...

8901
06:22:30,150 --> 06:22:32,290
like controlling this robot person.

8902
06:22:32,570 --> 06:22:33,850
It was so bad.

8903
06:22:34,050 --> 06:22:34,410
I...

8904
06:22:34,410 --> 06:22:35,890
It was so bad.

8905
06:22:36,850 --> 06:22:37,490
I'm done.

8906
06:22:40,150 --> 06:22:42,890
I don't remember what that movie was called.

8907
06:22:43,110 --> 06:22:46,710
But all I remember was we were one out of like ten...

8908
06:22:46,710 --> 06:22:48,150
like five people in the theater.

8909
06:22:51,110 --> 06:22:52,310
All right.

8910
06:22:52,310 --> 06:22:59,990
I think we can upgrade durability, armor.

8911
06:23:01,450 --> 06:23:03,270
And then we should be good.

8912
06:23:04,950 --> 06:23:06,670
Yeah, the Eddie Murphy one.

8913
06:23:11,090 --> 06:23:12,610
All right.

8914
06:23:14,690 --> 06:23:19,390
Um, so we actually have a meatsharing party little Pakistan restaurant right now.

8915
06:23:19,390 --> 06:23:23,480
in the parking lot of this restaurant.

8916
06:23:23,480 --> 06:23:23,540
I think he probably won't be making any potential payments.

8917
06:23:23,540 --> 06:23:32,940
He might just have an, uh...

8918
06:23:32,940 --> 06:23:36,460
He might just do everything for victory.

8919
06:23:36,460 --> 06:23:37,160
Nice.

8920
06:23:37,620 --> 06:23:38,760
I'm not very much...

8921
06:23:38,780 --> 06:23:38,800
Think it's pretty cool?

8922
06:23:38,800 --> 06:23:39,080
If anyone needs something.

8923
06:23:42,460 --> 06:23:43,500
I'm gonna do it!

8924
06:23:43,600 --> 06:23:43,700
I'm gonna do it!

8925
06:23:43,700 --> 06:23:43,920
I'm gonna do it!

8926
06:23:44,240 --> 06:23:44,980
I did it.

8927
06:23:46,100 --> 06:23:47,000
Alright, let's see.

8928
06:23:47,200 --> 06:23:48,740
I still... oh wait, I do have it.

8929
06:23:48,820 --> 06:23:49,640
Alright, might as well.

8930
06:23:50,000 --> 06:23:51,420
I might as well max it up.

8931
06:23:53,360 --> 06:23:54,880
Okay, I maxed it up.

8932
06:23:54,880 --> 06:23:56,700
And then, I might as well get the...

8933
06:23:58,220 --> 06:24:01,440
I don't really care about the gun and like this gun.

8934
06:24:01,500 --> 06:24:02,800
I might as well upgrade this.

8935
06:24:05,240 --> 06:24:07,300
Ammo capacity... I don't have that much ammo.

8936
06:24:07,920 --> 06:24:08,860
So I'll just...

8937
06:24:08,860 --> 06:24:10,000
I'll just do ammo capacity.

8938
06:24:11,800 --> 06:24:13,300
There we go.

8939
06:24:13,560 --> 06:24:14,580
I might as well do one.

8940
06:24:15,040 --> 06:24:15,420
Yeah.

8941
06:24:17,220 --> 06:24:17,740
Alright.

8942
06:24:19,560 --> 06:24:20,960
Alright, enough reload speed.

8943
06:24:22,820 --> 06:24:23,600
Reload fire?

8944
06:24:23,860 --> 06:24:24,360
Might as well.

8945
06:24:24,480 --> 06:24:25,060
Alright, that's good.

8946
06:24:26,940 --> 06:24:29,340
Alright, let's figure out the inventory.

8947
06:24:30,320 --> 06:24:30,840
Situation.

8948
06:24:33,500 --> 06:24:34,020
Okay.

8949
06:24:36,800 --> 06:24:37,100
Nice.

8950
06:24:38,600 --> 06:24:41,260
I might as well use my spinners too.

8951
06:24:41,860 --> 06:24:43,020
Alright, what do I need?

8952
06:24:44,840 --> 06:24:45,800
Uh, 23.

8953
06:24:47,580 --> 06:24:49,140
Uh, gun powder.

8954
06:24:50,260 --> 06:24:50,740
Uh...

8955
06:24:52,680 --> 06:24:56,940
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh I guess I could get the chip.

8956
06:24:57,160 --> 06:24:58,020
Oh my god.

8957
06:24:58,280 --> 06:25:00,080
These are... oh my god, I could...

8958
06:25:02,720 --> 06:25:05,860
There's some things money can't buy.

8959
06:25:06,800 --> 06:25:07,640
I could've...

8960
06:25:07,640 --> 06:25:10,520
I could've bought the challenge.

8961
06:25:15,680 --> 06:25:17,900
Oh my god.

8962
06:25:18,480 --> 06:25:20,480
God fucking damn it.

8963
06:25:20,640 --> 06:25:23,000
How do I keep doing this to myself?

8964
06:25:27,020 --> 06:25:27,820
Oh...

8965
06:25:31,960 --> 06:25:32,900
It's fine!

8966
06:25:33,280 --> 06:25:34,700
We don't reload anything!

8967
06:25:35,080 --> 06:25:36,780
We live... we live...

8968
06:25:36,800 --> 06:25:38,840
We live with our bad decisions!

8969
06:25:39,180 --> 06:25:39,720
Chat!

8970
06:25:40,700 --> 06:25:44,820
We have to live with our bad decisions in life.

8971
06:25:47,760 --> 06:25:50,900
Oh my god, I'm so stupid.

8972
06:25:51,600 --> 06:25:53,020
I'm so stupid.

8973
06:26:01,120 --> 06:26:02,960
Look where?

8974
06:26:03,340 --> 06:26:04,560
Look what?

8975
06:26:04,560 --> 06:26:06,440
What am I looking at?

8976
06:26:07,240 --> 06:26:07,820
What?

8977
06:26:09,900 --> 06:26:10,480
What?

8978
06:26:10,620 --> 06:26:11,320
Oh, this!

8979
06:26:11,620 --> 06:26:12,960
I was like, who?

8980
06:26:13,520 --> 06:26:14,100
Where?

8981
06:26:19,210 --> 06:26:19,790
Okay...

8982
06:26:22,310 --> 06:26:23,870
Is that... I'm like, huh?

8983
06:26:24,910 --> 06:26:26,070
Alright, before...

8984
06:26:26,070 --> 06:26:27,310
We're gonna look at her.

8985
06:26:27,530 --> 06:26:28,850
And then we use the bathroom.

8986
06:26:29,930 --> 06:26:30,890
I'll be right back.

8987
06:26:31,110 --> 06:26:32,250
Last bathroom break.

8988
06:26:32,290 --> 06:26:33,190
I'll be right back.

8989
06:27:52,080 --> 06:27:53,300
Alright, Ada.

8990
06:27:53,540 --> 06:27:55,820
I'm coming for you!

8991
06:27:57,720 --> 06:27:58,580
I'm coming for you!

8992
06:27:58,580 --> 06:28:00,120
I'm gonna save you, Ada!

8993
06:28:00,800 --> 06:28:02,980
I'm gonna save you, Ada!

8994
06:28:04,540 --> 06:28:05,140
I'm gonna save you, Ada!

8995
06:28:05,140 --> 06:28:05,240
Woo!

8996
06:28:05,440 --> 06:28:05,900
Let's go!

8997
06:28:06,760 --> 06:28:07,360
Woo!

8998
06:28:07,360 --> 06:28:07,360
Let's go!

8999
06:28:07,360 --> 06:28:07,460
Let's go!

9000
06:28:09,000 --> 06:28:10,260
Oh, thank god.

9001
06:28:10,960 --> 06:28:11,860
Oh, thank god.

9002
06:28:11,860 --> 06:28:12,420
Yes, stay here!

9003
06:28:12,700 --> 06:28:13,760
Oh, thank god.

9004
06:28:13,760 --> 06:28:13,760
Yes, stay here!

9005
06:28:16,300 --> 06:28:18,440
That makes me feel a lot better.

9006
06:28:18,580 --> 06:28:18,740
That makes me feel a lot better.

9007
06:28:20,780 --> 06:28:21,880
Please stay there.

9008
06:28:22,060 --> 06:28:22,520
Please stay there.

9009
06:28:29,280 --> 06:28:31,280
Oh, that is very...

9010
06:28:35,620 --> 06:28:36,180
Bro!

9011
06:28:36,560 --> 06:28:39,520
You're so lucky she did not land on her head.

9012
06:28:39,720 --> 06:28:41,460
You're so fucking lucky.

9013
06:28:44,700 --> 06:28:46,620
Bro, that's fucking meta.

9014
06:28:48,980 --> 06:28:50,100
That gotta hurt.

9015
06:29:01,930 --> 06:29:02,950
Bro, she's okay.

9016
06:29:03,130 --> 06:29:04,690
She's in heals, but she's okay.

9017
06:29:06,930 --> 06:29:07,990
Shoot the head!

9018
06:29:08,130 --> 06:29:09,390
Stop shooting the arm!

9019
06:29:09,510 --> 06:29:10,650
You're like five feet!

9020
06:29:13,890 --> 06:29:14,770
Oh, shit.

9021
06:29:14,870 --> 06:29:15,610
Oh, shit.

9022
06:29:19,170 --> 06:29:19,810
Oh!

9023
06:29:39,630 --> 06:29:40,910
Oh, shit!

9024
06:29:42,650 --> 06:29:43,210
Bro!

9025
06:29:47,470 --> 06:29:48,310
Oh, fuck!

9026
06:29:48,670 --> 06:29:50,430
Those are a lot of eyes!

9027
06:29:52,670 --> 06:29:53,770
This is it!

9028
06:29:56,890 --> 06:29:58,030
This is it!

9029
06:29:58,290 --> 06:29:58,410
Oh!

9030
06:29:59,010 --> 06:30:00,690
This is not it.

9031
06:30:01,550 --> 06:30:02,150
Hahaha!

9032
06:30:03,850 --> 06:30:04,450
Hahaha!

9033
06:30:04,550 --> 06:30:04,610
Hahaha!

9034
06:30:06,050 --> 06:30:08,690
This might not be it, guys.

9035
06:30:09,110 --> 06:30:10,370
Let me go!

9036
06:30:10,710 --> 06:30:12,110
Let me go!

9037
06:30:12,350 --> 06:30:13,190
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

9038
06:30:13,290 --> 06:30:13,770
I got it.

9039
06:30:13,850 --> 06:30:14,390
Guys!

9040
06:30:17,490 --> 06:30:18,410
This is it!

9041
06:30:18,470 --> 06:30:20,950
This is it!

9042
06:30:20,950 --> 06:30:21,470
Wait.

9043
06:30:21,770 --> 06:30:23,370
Why is your eyes not open?

9044
06:30:25,610 --> 06:30:26,130
Why is your eyes not open?

9045
06:30:26,150 --> 06:30:29,870
This is not...

9046
06:30:31,470 --> 06:30:31,990
Wow!

9047
06:30:33,270 --> 06:30:35,950
Oh, I go down!

9048
06:30:36,750 --> 06:30:37,970
Go down, Leon!

9049
06:30:44,470 --> 06:30:46,790
Why am I... Why am I using my pistol?

9050
06:30:49,970 --> 06:30:50,750
Oh, God!

9051
06:30:51,230 --> 06:30:52,290
Oh, God, run!

9052
06:30:52,650 --> 06:30:53,690
Oh, but what if it's...

9053
06:30:53,870 --> 06:30:54,430
What if I get lo...

9054
06:30:55,550 --> 06:30:57,030
Oh, I can stab your eyes!

9055
06:30:57,130 --> 06:30:57,850
Stab his eyes!

9056
06:31:01,050 --> 06:31:01,930
Stab his eyes!

9057
06:31:05,370 --> 06:31:05,810
Stab his eyes!

9058
06:31:05,810 --> 06:31:05,850
Oh!

9059
06:31:06,070 --> 06:31:07,430
Run, run, run, run, run!

9060
06:31:07,730 --> 06:31:08,170
No!

9061
06:31:12,050 --> 06:31:13,110
This is it.

9062
06:31:13,850 --> 06:31:14,750
Where's my nades?

9063
06:31:14,770 --> 06:31:16,030
Where is my big nade?

9064
06:31:16,750 --> 06:31:17,570
Where is he?

9065
06:31:20,170 --> 06:31:20,770
Oh, God.

9066
06:31:21,310 --> 06:31:21,750
Oh, God.

9067
06:31:23,870 --> 06:31:24,150
Oh, God.

9068
06:31:25,990 --> 06:31:27,390
Oh, the babies!

9069
06:31:29,430 --> 06:31:31,310
Oh, where is he jumping to?

9070
06:31:36,330 --> 06:31:37,590
I'm so lost!

9071
06:31:37,890 --> 06:31:39,890
Okay, where... Why am I using my pistol?

9072
06:31:40,010 --> 06:31:41,070
I am so confused.

9073
06:31:42,630 --> 06:31:43,390
Please throw.

9074
06:31:43,490 --> 06:31:44,090
Please throw.

9075
06:31:44,190 --> 06:31:44,350
No!

9076
06:31:52,330 --> 06:31:53,630
I'm trying to throw everything.

9077
06:31:54,690 --> 06:31:56,550
I'm trying to throw everything right now.

9078
06:31:58,290 --> 06:31:58,810
Wait!

9079
06:31:59,070 --> 06:32:00,330
I have a Magna!

9080
06:32:05,380 --> 06:32:05,900
Guys!

9081
06:32:10,260 --> 06:32:11,080
Oh, my God.

9082
06:32:12,940 --> 06:32:13,460
No!

9083
06:32:13,640 --> 06:32:14,060
No!

9084
06:32:16,920 --> 06:32:17,440
No!

9085
06:32:17,580 --> 06:32:18,700
Let me go!

9086
06:32:23,770 --> 06:32:24,290
Bro!

9087
06:32:26,870 --> 06:32:27,910
Oh, please!

9088
06:32:30,530 --> 06:32:31,270
Oh, God.

9089
06:32:31,270 --> 06:32:31,430
Oh, God.

9090
06:32:31,690 --> 06:32:32,570
This is it.

9091
06:32:32,910 --> 06:32:33,590
Oh, no.

9092
06:32:33,650 --> 06:32:34,210
This is it.

9093
06:32:35,370 --> 06:32:36,170
Let me out.

9094
06:32:36,250 --> 06:32:36,690
Let me out.

9095
06:32:36,770 --> 06:32:37,410
Let me out.

9096
06:32:37,410 --> 06:32:37,930
Let me out.

9097
06:32:37,930 --> 06:32:38,550
Let me out.

9098
06:32:43,370 --> 06:32:44,430
Let me out.

9099
06:32:45,450 --> 06:32:46,330
Let me out.

9100
06:32:46,330 --> 06:32:46,490
Let me out.

9101
06:32:47,910 --> 06:32:48,350
Stab!

9102
06:32:49,610 --> 06:32:50,050
Stab!

9103
06:32:52,830 --> 06:32:53,770
Oh, thank God!

9104
06:32:55,270 --> 06:32:55,950
Phase 2!

9105
06:32:56,110 --> 06:32:57,490
This has to be Phase 2!

9106
06:33:03,030 --> 06:33:03,850
There's no way.

9107
06:33:03,930 --> 06:33:04,870
There's no way.

9108
06:33:04,930 --> 06:33:05,870
There's a Phase 2.

9109
06:33:05,930 --> 06:33:07,110
There's no fucking way.

9110
06:33:07,590 --> 06:33:09,550
There's no fucking way.

9111
06:33:09,690 --> 06:33:11,210
I didn't get an achievement.

9112
06:33:32,650 --> 06:33:34,610
There's always a Phase 2.

9113
06:33:35,010 --> 06:33:37,170
There's always a Phase 2!

9114
06:33:38,530 --> 06:33:39,170
How?

9115
06:33:39,870 --> 06:33:40,970
What do I do?

9116
06:33:43,810 --> 06:33:44,450
Okay.

9117
06:33:49,270 --> 06:33:50,330
There you go.

9118
06:33:52,210 --> 06:33:53,290
Oh, God.

9119
06:33:55,570 --> 06:33:56,570
Oh, God.

9120
06:33:56,750 --> 06:33:57,290
Oh, God.

9121
06:33:58,550 --> 06:33:59,350
Invade!

9122
06:33:59,350 --> 06:33:59,710
Invade!

9123
06:34:00,410 --> 06:34:01,210
Yes!

9124
06:34:01,510 --> 06:34:02,470
Rocket Launcher!

9125
06:34:06,570 --> 06:34:07,710
Where is it?

9126
06:34:07,870 --> 06:34:08,950
Where is it?

9127
06:34:11,050 --> 06:34:11,850
Boom!

9128
06:34:18,600 --> 06:34:19,780
Don't miss!

9129
06:34:20,280 --> 06:34:21,080
Don't miss!

9130
06:34:21,080 --> 06:34:21,480
Don't miss!

9131
06:34:21,860 --> 06:34:23,760
It was possible.

9132
06:34:23,760 --> 06:34:24,720
It was possible.

9133
06:34:39,470 --> 06:34:40,410
Oh, fuck!

9134
06:34:40,630 --> 06:34:41,370
Oh, fuck!

9135
06:34:43,570 --> 06:34:45,690
One last shank for the ride.

9136
06:34:49,270 --> 06:34:50,750
Goodbye, Adam Sandler.

9137
06:34:50,890 --> 06:34:52,670
Your Netflix deals are over!

9138
06:34:58,200 --> 06:34:59,420
I didn't miss.

9139
06:34:59,600 --> 06:35:02,040
All those eggs trained me for this moment.

9140
06:35:03,320 --> 06:35:04,220
Hello, Ada.

9141
06:35:07,140 --> 06:35:07,620
Ada.

9142
06:35:08,860 --> 06:35:10,120
What the hell are you doing?

9143
06:35:10,940 --> 06:35:12,280
Nothing personal, Leon.

9144
06:35:12,760 --> 06:35:15,800
God, I hate her voice acting in this one.

9145
06:35:16,000 --> 06:35:16,220
Don't worry.

9146
06:35:16,380 --> 06:35:17,500
I'll take good care of it.

9147
06:35:17,720 --> 06:35:19,160
It's just so dead inside.

9148
06:35:20,560 --> 06:35:25,040
Like, I guess she's supposed to be dead inside, but still...

9149
06:35:26,060 --> 06:35:26,800
You coming?

9150
06:35:27,320 --> 06:35:29,300
She's like mega dead inside.

9151
06:35:30,400 --> 06:35:31,900
I think we both know this.

9152
06:35:31,900 --> 06:35:34,020
This is where we go our separate ways.

9153
06:35:37,740 --> 06:35:38,580
I see.

9154
06:35:48,710 --> 06:35:49,830
I see.

9155
06:35:49,830 --> 06:35:50,130
Oh.

9156
06:35:50,630 --> 06:35:51,190
Ada?

9157
06:35:52,050 --> 06:35:53,310
Better get a move on.

9158
06:35:53,370 --> 06:35:53,870
Ada?

9159
06:35:56,090 --> 06:35:56,650
What?

9160
06:35:59,050 --> 06:36:01,070
Better get a move on.

9161
06:36:01,530 --> 06:36:01,550
Better get a move on.

9162
06:36:01,550 --> 06:36:02,950
Better get a move on.

9163
06:36:03,690 --> 06:36:05,130
Ada, what can I...

9164
06:36:05,130 --> 06:36:05,890
Ada, why?

9165
06:36:06,010 --> 06:36:07,330
Why can't I join you on the helicopter?

9166
06:36:15,050 --> 06:36:15,970
Where she go?

9167
06:36:15,990 --> 06:36:17,050
Who knows.

9168
06:36:17,310 --> 06:36:18,250
I don't understand.

9169
06:36:18,450 --> 06:36:19,230
Why would she just...

9170
06:36:19,230 --> 06:36:19,510
Oh!

9171
06:36:20,190 --> 06:36:22,610
Yeah, we better move, Ashley.

9172
06:36:24,270 --> 06:36:24,970
Oh no.

9173
06:36:30,440 --> 06:36:35,020
You know, Ada, you could've just like let Ashley and I on the fucking boat.

9174
06:36:35,120 --> 06:36:36,280
Like, on the fucking helicopter.

9175
06:36:36,820 --> 06:36:37,380
You know?

9176
06:36:38,420 --> 06:36:39,180
When it hurt.

9177
06:36:40,000 --> 06:36:40,560
Which way?

9178
06:36:40,640 --> 06:36:41,000
Which way?

9179
06:36:41,040 --> 06:36:41,400
Which way?

9180
06:36:42,700 --> 06:36:43,320
Which way?

9181
06:36:44,880 --> 06:36:45,820
Okay, we gotta go.

9182
06:36:45,880 --> 06:36:46,320
We gotta go.

9183
06:36:47,720 --> 06:36:49,060
I'm reloading every fucking thing.

9184
06:36:49,080 --> 06:36:49,640
I have.

9185
06:36:49,820 --> 06:36:50,820
We gotta go.

9186
06:36:51,680 --> 06:36:52,980
Now we can go home.

9187
06:36:53,240 --> 06:36:54,660
Yes, we can, Ashley.

9188
06:36:56,200 --> 06:36:57,420
Just keep running.

9189
06:36:58,320 --> 06:36:59,160
Just keep running.

9190
06:36:59,160 --> 06:36:59,480
Whoa!

9191
06:37:01,060 --> 06:37:01,900
Don't worry.

9192
06:37:03,120 --> 06:37:03,680
Jump!

9193
06:37:07,080 --> 06:37:09,120
Leon, why the fuck did you refuse?

9194
06:37:10,100 --> 06:37:10,780
Leon, why the fuck did you refuse?

9195
06:37:11,500 --> 06:37:12,060
What?

9196
06:37:12,580 --> 06:37:13,140
Oh,

9197
06:37:17,870 --> 06:37:18,030
God.

9198
06:37:19,210 --> 06:37:20,390
Oh, my God.

9199
06:37:21,210 --> 06:37:22,150
Keep running.

9200
06:37:22,190 --> 06:37:22,810
Keep running.

9201
06:37:22,950 --> 06:37:24,730
They're nothing now their master's gone.

9202
06:37:25,350 --> 06:37:26,350
Keep running!

9203
06:37:28,670 --> 06:37:29,650
Keep running!

9204
06:37:30,290 --> 06:37:30,630
Keep running!

9205
06:37:33,850 --> 06:37:34,130
Move!

9206
06:37:35,910 --> 06:37:39,410
Ashley, I would love it if you could help out.

9207
06:37:41,270 --> 06:37:43,430
Ashley, I would love it if you could help out.

9208
06:37:43,430 --> 06:37:44,050
Ashley, I would love it if you could help out.

9209
06:37:44,050 --> 06:37:46,110
Thank you for watching, Ashley.

9210
06:37:46,490 --> 06:37:46,950
All right.

9211
06:37:47,490 --> 06:37:48,590
Not bad, Ada.

9212
06:37:48,710 --> 06:37:51,410
I... I really appreciate that.

9213
06:37:51,490 --> 06:37:51,590
I...

9214
06:37:51,590 --> 06:37:51,590
I really appreciate that.

9215
06:37:52,330 --> 06:37:53,170
You like thrill rides?

9216
06:37:54,710 --> 06:37:55,910
You're gonna love this!

9217
06:38:00,560 --> 06:38:01,500
Wait, what?

9218
06:38:01,820 --> 06:38:03,240
I still have to play?

9219
06:38:06,260 --> 06:38:10,460
What do you mean I still have... where's my cutscene?

9220
06:38:13,320 --> 06:38:15,100
No cutscene for me, I guess.

9221
06:38:15,820 --> 06:38:16,100
Ow!

9222
06:38:16,360 --> 06:38:16,940
Oh, fuck.

9223
06:38:17,080 --> 06:38:18,400
Oh, this is not good.

9224
06:38:18,400 --> 06:38:20,880
This is... what?

9225
06:38:25,600 --> 06:38:28,060
The slowest fucking jump to the ramp.

9226
06:38:29,960 --> 06:38:32,740
Oh my god, I can't believe no cutscene privileges.

9227
06:38:34,220 --> 06:38:36,320
No cutscene privileges for me.

9228
06:38:39,400 --> 06:38:40,360
Oh god!

9229
06:38:40,480 --> 06:38:41,200
Oh shit!

9230
06:38:41,260 --> 06:38:41,780
Oh shit!

9231
06:38:41,860 --> 06:38:42,640
Oh, we're dead.

9232
06:38:42,820 --> 06:38:43,900
Actually, this is it.

9233
06:38:44,180 --> 06:38:45,440
Actually, I fucked up.

9234
06:38:46,060 --> 06:38:47,700
Please, please tell me this is the end.

9235
06:38:51,470 --> 06:38:53,730
Oh god, oh, this is so bad.

9236
06:38:56,230 --> 06:38:58,090
Actually, the bonus 1 HP!

9237
06:39:01,390 --> 06:39:04,470
We are one hit, guys.

9238
06:39:07,410 --> 06:39:09,990
We are... we are one hit!

9239
06:39:13,630 --> 06:39:19,490
We are one

9240
06:39:36,220 --> 06:39:36,580
HP.

9241
06:39:37,120 --> 06:39:42,450
I'm not sure that was insane.

9242
06:39:44,610 --> 06:39:46,330
We did it, yeah!

9243
06:39:57,650 --> 06:39:59,330
Finally got my cutscene.

9244
06:39:59,770 --> 06:40:01,010
I did it.

9245
06:40:01,170 --> 06:40:02,230
I did it.

9246
06:40:21,350 --> 06:40:24,150
Bro, nepotism?

9247
06:40:24,950 --> 06:40:26,350
Bro.

9248
06:40:32,890 --> 06:40:34,650
Ashley, I can't.

9249
06:40:34,690 --> 06:40:35,630
Chris won't let me.

9250
06:40:35,790 --> 06:40:37,590
I gotta hook up with Claire.

9251
06:40:37,870 --> 06:40:38,710
I can't, Ashley.

9252
06:40:43,870 --> 06:40:45,930
Bro, I'm scared of Chris, man.

9253
06:40:57,550 --> 06:40:58,030
Bro,

9254
06:41:01,090 --> 06:41:01,450
answer!

9255
06:41:02,010 --> 06:41:02,930
This is a... Bro!

9256
06:41:03,170 --> 06:41:06,510
If I don't answer, she's gonna think I killed the president's daughter.

9257
06:41:07,390 --> 06:41:07,870
Like...

9258
06:41:13,310 --> 06:41:13,790
Bro...

9259
06:41:14,310 --> 06:41:15,810
She's gonna be like, oh no.

9260
06:41:15,890 --> 06:41:15,910
Oh no.

9261
06:41:16,390 --> 06:41:17,830
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

9262
06:41:17,910 --> 06:41:18,930
Your daughter's dead.

9263
06:41:19,890 --> 06:41:21,450
Leon did not answer.

9264
06:41:23,950 --> 06:41:26,290
I can't believe that he's coasting his work.

9265
06:41:27,130 --> 06:41:28,270
Man, thank you for the super chat.

9266
06:41:28,330 --> 06:41:28,990
Thank you, thank you.

9267
06:41:28,990 --> 06:41:30,630
Congrats on clearing Resident Evil 4!

9268
06:41:30,910 --> 06:41:33,050
8 out of 10 out of 10 until she opens her mouth.

9269
06:41:33,230 --> 06:41:34,070
Can't wait to hear...

9270
06:41:34,070 --> 06:41:34,590
Oh, yeah.

9271
06:41:35,470 --> 06:41:36,450
Don't worry, guys.

9272
06:41:36,550 --> 06:41:38,690
We're totally coming back for part 4.

9273
06:41:41,690 --> 06:41:42,490
Don't worry.

9274
06:41:42,490 --> 06:41:42,710
Don't worry.

9275
06:41:45,270 --> 06:41:46,630
Zonderman, thank you for the super chat.

9276
06:41:46,670 --> 06:41:47,430
Thank you, thank you.

9277
06:41:47,590 --> 06:41:49,770
I missed a scene in the OG when she...

9278
06:41:49,770 --> 06:41:50,130
Oh, wait.

9279
06:41:50,250 --> 06:41:51,630
Does she actually do this?

9280
06:41:51,650 --> 06:41:53,570
Like, no one kicks her off the jet ski.

9281
06:41:53,810 --> 06:41:54,830
Thank you for the super chat.

9282
06:41:54,910 --> 06:41:55,890
Thank you, thank you.

9283
06:41:56,870 --> 06:41:58,410
Chris Redfield, thank you for the super chat.

9284
06:41:58,490 --> 06:41:59,250
Thank you, thank you.

9285
06:41:59,270 --> 06:42:01,030
Yes, the bloodline will continue.

9286
06:42:01,230 --> 06:42:02,410
Thank you for the super chat.

9287
06:42:02,450 --> 06:42:03,250
Thank you, thank you.

9288
06:42:04,350 --> 06:42:05,510
Oh, my God.

9289
06:42:05,610 --> 06:42:08,490
I'm so happy to beat Resident Evil 4 chat.

9290
06:42:08,850 --> 06:42:10,230
I'm so fucking happy.

9291
06:42:10,470 --> 06:42:11,450
We did it, everybody.

9292
06:42:12,150 --> 06:42:13,270
I'm so tired.

9293
06:42:13,490 --> 06:42:14,690
I'm so tired.

9294
06:42:17,950 --> 06:42:19,290
What a journey.

9295
06:42:20,950 --> 06:42:22,950
What a fucking journey.

9296
06:42:23,470 --> 06:42:24,810
Oh, my God.

9297
06:42:24,930 --> 06:42:26,830
Almost seven hours today.

9298
06:42:27,770 --> 06:42:29,290
I'm definitely gonna take it easy.

9299
06:42:29,450 --> 06:42:30,770
I'm definitely gonna be with you.

9300
06:42:31,790 --> 06:42:32,370
What's this?

9301
06:42:32,630 --> 06:42:33,590
Oh, that's the cup.

9302
06:42:34,570 --> 06:42:35,370
That's the cup.

9303
06:42:35,550 --> 06:42:37,170
Is there after credits scene chat?

9304
06:42:39,070 --> 06:42:40,290
Are you actually gonna do it?

9305
06:42:40,290 --> 06:42:40,810
Of course not.

9306
06:42:49,010 --> 06:42:52,470
Guys, there's always been a line for DLC, guys.

9307
06:42:52,650 --> 06:42:54,330
I'm already... I'm fucking tired.

9308
06:42:54,610 --> 06:42:55,410
I'm tired.

9309
06:43:00,390 --> 06:43:02,150
Lord Corosus, thank you for the super chat.

9310
06:43:02,230 --> 06:43:02,950
Thank you, thank you.

9311
06:43:03,070 --> 06:43:09,970
Considering in Resident Evil 5, Chris Redfield can backhand zombies so hard, their heads detonate due to his biceps being the size of tree trunks.

9312
06:43:09,970 --> 06:43:11,750
Yeah, I'm afraid of him too.

9313
06:43:12,050 --> 06:43:13,290
Thank you for the super chat.

9314
06:43:13,410 --> 06:43:14,250
Thank you, thank you.

9315
06:43:15,450 --> 06:43:17,290
Yeah, DLC gets in the line.

9316
06:43:17,750 --> 06:43:19,210
It has to be in the line.

9317
06:43:20,850 --> 06:43:21,950
Oh, after credits.

9318
06:43:24,670 --> 06:43:25,390
Is that Ada?

9319
06:43:28,270 --> 06:43:29,270
Oh, that's the Amber.

9320
06:43:32,730 --> 06:43:34,350
Callan, thank you for the 10 gift shits.

9321
06:43:34,410 --> 06:43:35,070
Thank you, thank you.

9322
06:43:37,050 --> 06:43:37,770
Catch me through.

9323
06:43:40,530 --> 06:43:41,370
Mike too.

9324
06:43:41,850 --> 06:43:42,990
I've obtained the Amber.

9325
06:43:43,230 --> 06:43:44,050
Is that Wesker?

9326
06:43:44,210 --> 06:43:44,890
Hey Wesker.

9327
06:43:45,090 --> 06:43:45,130
Excellent.

9328
06:43:47,170 --> 06:43:48,370
Just one question.

9329
06:43:49,270 --> 06:43:51,070
What are you planning to do with this?

9330
06:43:51,450 --> 06:43:54,070
I do not pay you to ask questions.

9331
06:43:54,090 --> 06:43:54,650
Whoa!

9332
06:43:55,630 --> 06:43:59,850
All you need to know is a new dawn is breaking in.

9333
06:43:59,850 --> 06:44:00,430
Damn!

9334
06:44:00,750 --> 06:44:03,250
You let him talk to you like that, Ada?

9335
06:44:03,590 --> 06:44:04,830
Just one may live.

9336
06:44:07,550 --> 06:44:09,810
I'm expediting that change.

9337
06:44:11,790 --> 06:44:12,590
Wesker.

9338
06:44:12,790 --> 06:44:15,410
So, we're talking millions of casualties.

9339
06:44:16,830 --> 06:44:17,630
Billions.

9340
06:44:20,350 --> 06:44:21,530
How ambitious.

9341
06:44:26,620 --> 06:44:28,580
We're changing course now.

9342
06:44:32,460 --> 06:44:36,340
He's like, bro, I watched my twins dead.

9343
06:44:37,780 --> 06:44:38,920
That's fine.

9344
06:44:39,640 --> 06:44:40,780
Oh, that's them.

9345
06:44:41,200 --> 06:44:41,900
There's Leon.

9346
06:44:42,480 --> 06:44:43,440
And Ashley.

9347
06:44:45,040 --> 06:44:46,580
Also, have they eaten at all?

9348
06:44:57,550 --> 06:44:58,690
We did it!

9349
06:44:59,010 --> 06:45:01,150
Oh my god, we fucking did it.

9350
06:45:03,770 --> 06:45:05,030
DDragon, thank you for the super chat.

9351
06:45:05,110 --> 06:45:05,890
Thank you, thank you.

9352
06:45:05,990 --> 06:45:07,070
I'm sorry, Chris.

9353
06:45:07,410 --> 06:45:11,810
But an OG canon Leon and Ada have gotten jiggy with it.

9354
06:45:11,890 --> 06:45:13,670
And at one point between games.

9355
06:45:14,190 --> 06:45:15,850
Please, thank you for the super chat.

9356
06:45:15,930 --> 06:45:16,770
Thank you, thank you.

9357
06:45:17,850 --> 06:45:18,570
GG's, everyone.

9358
06:45:19,970 --> 06:45:20,450
GG's.

9359
06:45:20,450 --> 06:45:21,710
We fucking did it.

9360
06:45:21,790 --> 06:45:24,310
We fucking beat Resident Evil 4.

9361
06:45:25,170 --> 06:45:26,230
I'm so happy.

9362
06:45:27,430 --> 06:45:28,650
Productions, thank you for the super chat.

9363
06:45:28,690 --> 06:45:29,290
Thank you, thank you.

9364
06:45:29,350 --> 06:45:32,450
I didn't know Naomi from JJK was in Resident Evil 4.

9365
06:45:32,930 --> 06:45:33,330
Many.

9366
06:45:33,430 --> 06:45:34,390
Thank you for the super chat.

9367
06:45:34,450 --> 06:45:35,210
Thank you, thank you.

9368
06:45:35,930 --> 06:45:37,630
PilotFood, it's so easy to Ada.

9369
06:45:37,850 --> 06:45:38,190
Same.

9370
06:45:38,410 --> 06:45:39,190
Thank you for the super chat.

9371
06:45:39,270 --> 06:45:40,050
Thank you, thank you.

9372
06:45:41,510 --> 06:45:42,470
Oh my god.

9373
06:45:43,770 --> 06:45:45,790
Is there another actor after credits scene?

9374
06:45:46,270 --> 06:45:46,670
Guys?

9375
06:45:47,430 --> 06:45:47,950
Is there?

9376
06:45:48,010 --> 06:45:50,070
I just need a note.

9377
06:45:50,070 --> 06:45:53,170
Is there another actor after credits scene?

9378
06:45:55,270 --> 06:45:57,530
I can't trust any games anymore.

9379
06:45:57,790 --> 06:46:00,790
Everyone always adds an actor after credits scene to everything.

9380
06:46:01,290 --> 06:46:02,370
It's like...

9381
06:46:03,070 --> 06:46:05,850
There's always actor after credits scenes for every fucking...

9382
06:46:05,850 --> 06:46:07,610
Like actor after... I fucking knew it.

9383
06:46:11,460 --> 06:46:13,420
The actor after credits scene.

9384
06:46:14,160 --> 06:46:15,540
The Marvel syndrome.

9385
06:46:19,180 --> 06:46:20,020
That's us.

9386
06:46:20,320 --> 06:46:21,160
We're safe.

9387
06:46:23,100 --> 06:46:23,620
Good work.

9388
06:46:24,320 --> 06:46:24,920
B?

9389
06:46:25,900 --> 06:46:26,820
Excuse me?

9390
06:46:27,320 --> 06:46:30,380
I had an 80 plus percent fucking...

9391
06:46:31,180 --> 06:46:32,380
14 hour...

9392
06:46:32,380 --> 06:46:34,980
I had an 80 percent play... like...

9393
06:46:34,980 --> 06:46:37,540
80 percent accuracy rate average.

9394
06:46:39,940 --> 06:46:41,420
I can't believe it.

9395
06:46:41,620 --> 06:46:42,900
Well, I got sunglasses though.

9396
06:46:43,360 --> 06:46:43,960
Nice.

9397
06:46:44,200 --> 06:46:44,560
Look!

9398
06:46:44,640 --> 06:46:45,240
80 percent!

9399
06:46:45,920 --> 06:46:46,140
Cole!

9400
06:46:46,260 --> 06:46:47,560
Thank you for the Akasupa.

9401
06:46:47,700 --> 06:46:48,400
Thank you, thank you.

9402
06:46:48,460 --> 06:46:49,080
Here, catch.

9403
06:46:49,240 --> 06:46:50,200
Thank you, Cole.

9404
06:46:50,640 --> 06:46:52,580
I can't... too many saves?

9405
06:46:53,100 --> 06:46:53,940
Are you serious?

9406
06:46:54,360 --> 06:46:56,080
Is... does that actually...

9407
06:46:56,080 --> 06:46:58,700
Does that actually affect your... your...

9408
06:46:58,700 --> 06:46:59,200
What?

9409
06:46:59,840 --> 06:47:02,500
Look, you can't be too careful with saving.

9410
06:47:05,360 --> 06:47:07,300
You can't be too careful!

9411
06:47:07,720 --> 06:47:10,300
I grew up with saving all the time!

9412
06:47:14,020 --> 06:47:16,240
We're always saving our games.

9413
06:47:16,280 --> 06:47:19,560
No matter... no matter where we're... where we are at.

9414
06:47:19,940 --> 06:47:22,280
We loot one thing, we save the game.

9415
06:47:23,100 --> 06:47:25,380
We take one damage, we save the game.

9416
06:47:29,220 --> 06:47:30,940
Oh my god.

9417
06:47:31,160 --> 06:47:32,420
We did it.

9418
06:47:32,840 --> 06:47:34,100
I'm so happy.

9419
06:47:34,200 --> 06:47:35,900
We fucking did it.

9420
06:47:36,100 --> 06:47:38,320
Our second game completed.

9421
06:47:39,720 --> 06:47:41,560
My game's not closing.

9422
06:47:42,000 --> 06:47:43,740
I was like...

9423
06:47:43,740 --> 06:47:46,880
I was like, why isn't my game closing?

9424
06:47:47,500 --> 06:47:48,240
Hehehehehe.

9425
06:47:49,360 --> 06:47:50,100
Hahaha.

9426
06:47:52,040 --> 06:47:52,410
Oh.

9427
06:47:52,410 --> 06:47:53,470
Oh my god.

9428
06:47:53,490 --> 06:47:54,310
I'm so tired.

9429
06:47:54,410 --> 06:47:55,150
I'm so tired.

9430
06:47:55,190 --> 06:47:56,750
I bet you guys are really tired too.

9431
06:47:56,950 --> 06:47:58,190
But I had such a fun time!

9432
06:47:58,670 --> 06:48:02,790
I had a really fun time beating this game, chat.

9433
06:48:02,970 --> 06:48:04,650
I can't believe we did it.

9434
06:48:04,830 --> 06:48:05,390
Hahaha.

9435
06:48:05,810 --> 06:48:10,670
I apologize to everybody who are fucking dying right now.

9436
06:48:10,750 --> 06:48:14,190
Watching a seven... like almost seven hours of this.

9437
06:48:14,410 --> 06:48:16,210
But we fucking did it, chat.

9438
06:48:16,470 --> 06:48:17,890
We fucking...

9439
06:48:17,890 --> 06:48:18,570
Hahaha.

9440
06:48:19,430 --> 06:48:20,670
We made it!

9441
06:48:20,710 --> 06:48:21,690
That's all that matters!

9442
06:48:21,690 --> 06:48:24,150
We fucking made it to the end.

9443
06:48:24,370 --> 06:48:25,230
Thank you everybody.

9444
06:48:25,430 --> 06:48:31,410
The next game series we're gonna start next is Dead Rising!

9445
06:48:31,710 --> 06:48:39,910
We're gonna start Dead Rising next week because it's also a game I've been really wanting to play for a very, very long time.

9446
06:48:40,150 --> 06:48:43,050
And I can actually finally play it.

9447
06:48:43,150 --> 06:48:44,210
And I'm so excited.

9448
06:48:44,490 --> 06:48:45,270
Johnny, thank you!

9449
06:48:45,290 --> 06:48:46,390
Welcome to the tomato farm!

9450
06:48:46,530 --> 06:48:47,170
Welcome, welcome!

9451
06:48:47,470 --> 06:48:47,890
Yes.

9452
06:48:48,050 --> 06:48:48,810
The first one.

9453
06:48:48,910 --> 06:48:49,850
I wanna be a journalist.

9454
06:48:50,370 --> 06:48:51,250
I wanna...

9455
06:48:51,250 --> 06:48:51,630
Hahaha.

9456
06:48:53,770 --> 06:48:55,130
Yes, the first one.

9457
06:48:55,270 --> 06:48:56,990
I've always wanted to be a journalist.

9458
06:48:57,490 --> 06:48:59,010
So I'm gonna play Dead Rising.

9459
06:48:59,670 --> 06:49:01,050
Uh, yeah, thank you for the super chat.

9460
06:49:01,110 --> 06:49:01,770
Thank you, thank you.

9461
06:49:01,930 --> 06:49:04,350
I'm a speed runner for this game and I got an A-.

9462
06:49:04,490 --> 06:49:06,870
So three hours of completion one time?

9463
06:49:07,290 --> 06:49:08,210
What the fuck?

9464
06:49:08,650 --> 06:49:10,390
Then how do you get like an A-?

9465
06:49:11,450 --> 06:49:15,470
Like, like, I mean like how... like why is it so hard to get like a good grade?

9466
06:49:17,270 --> 06:49:18,690
Uh, yeah, thank you for the super chat.

9467
06:49:18,750 --> 06:49:19,550
Thank you, thank you.

9468
06:49:19,850 --> 06:49:20,750
It was really fun.

9469
06:49:20,750 --> 06:49:22,430
Not, not as scary.

9470
06:49:22,530 --> 06:49:23,130
Congrats, Doki.

9471
06:49:23,290 --> 06:49:25,630
Okay, the regenerator part was so fucked up.

9472
06:49:25,750 --> 06:49:27,970
That shit, that one was fucked up.

9473
06:49:28,070 --> 06:49:29,030
I did not like that.

9474
06:49:29,150 --> 06:49:30,610
I did not...

9475
06:49:34,550 --> 06:49:38,890
I, I did not like the regenerators at all.

9476
06:49:39,030 --> 06:49:41,210
That shit was so fucked up, man.

9477
06:49:41,430 --> 06:49:44,030
That shit was so messed up.

9478
06:49:47,230 --> 06:49:48,610
Oh my god.

9479
06:49:48,890 --> 06:49:50,730
Oh, I think the worst part was that...

9480
06:49:50,730 --> 06:49:51,750
I have to like...

9481
06:49:51,750 --> 06:49:53,050
I, I, the body bags.

9482
06:49:53,290 --> 06:49:55,710
I hated the body bag area so much.

9483
06:49:55,870 --> 06:49:59,850
Because even though I know there was no regenerators, the fucking sound of it was like...

9484
06:49:59,850 --> 06:50:01,630
bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.

9485
06:50:01,950 --> 06:50:02,990
Bling, bom, bom, bing.

9486
06:50:04,090 --> 06:50:06,890
Bling, bom, bom, bling, bom, bom, bling, bom, bom, bling.

9487
06:50:08,030 --> 06:50:12,750
I've been like listening to that song non-stop for like last two days.

9488
06:50:15,510 --> 06:50:17,290
Uh, T, thank you for the super chat.

9489
06:50:17,350 --> 06:50:17,990
Thank you, thank you.

9490
06:50:17,990 --> 06:50:25,350
I don't know like... I know like I'm like one month late.

9491
06:50:25,750 --> 06:50:28,430
Which is like me with every fucking anime out there.

9492
06:50:28,510 --> 06:50:33,030
I'm like way too late for the trend of Bling Bang Bang Born.

9493
06:50:33,370 --> 06:50:35,810
But like that song is so fucking addicting.

9494
06:50:35,930 --> 06:50:36,990
That is such a sick hook.

9495
06:50:37,650 --> 06:50:39,690
