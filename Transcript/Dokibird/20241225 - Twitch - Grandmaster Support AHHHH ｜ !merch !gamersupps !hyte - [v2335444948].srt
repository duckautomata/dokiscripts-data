00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,750
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,390
Sorry I took so long to start my stream.

3
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,690
I woke up from my nap so I had to wake up mentally and emotionally.

4
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,850
So I had to wake up.

5
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,250
Oh my god.

6
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,030
I was like, do I stream today?

7
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,130
I just really just want to play Marvel Rivals.

8
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,170
And then I was like, what if I just stream Marvel Rivals?

9
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,630
But Merry Christmas for those on the other side of the world!

10
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,590
Also, Crim, thank you for the Twitch Prime!

11
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,290
Thank you, thank you!

12
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,790
For those who don't know what Twitch Pri- Oh my gosh, it's been so long since I showed my Twitch.

13
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,810
I also realized, wait, I should like update my like, Twitch stuff too.

14
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,050
Cause I'm like, ooh I tabbed out and my PC's like, no.

15
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,670
Wait, what is my title?

16
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,870
I realized I should update a lot of stuff on my Twitch.

17
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,050
Oh yeah, okay.

18
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,270
Wait, I'm gonna make a Nendoroid tag right now.

19
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,650
Nendoroid, okay.

20
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,050
And then, let me- Nightbot.

21
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,810
Guys, I'm doing it all live.

22
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,870
I realized I never made my Nendoroid.

23
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,670
Okay, nightbot.tv.

24
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,650
Authorized.

25
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,990
Wait, is one my monster?

26
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,590
You make my Nendoroid tag.

27
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,190
Oh wait, maybe I should make my own tag.

28
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,270
Alright, new command.

29
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,910
Nendoroid.

30
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,610
I have a Nendoroid now!

31
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,010
Bye, bye, bye!

32
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,030
Okay, what are the links?

33
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,830
I have a Nendoroid, but like what are my links to Nendoroid again?

34
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,370
Alright, don't worry, I'm gonna find it.

35
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,810
Okay, I have like- Okay, here we go.

36
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,690
NA international, there we go.

37
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,710
NA international, there we go.

38
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,270
Create.

39
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,810
Oh, command name- Wait, I already have it?

40
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,030
Oh shit, someone else made it!

41
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,710
Yay!

42
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,390
Alright, cool.

43
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,810
Oh, nice.

44
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,850
Okay, that's great.

45
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,830
Someone else did the job for- Oh, thank god.

46
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,850
I have mods.

47
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,690
I was like, gonna make it and it was like, command is already created.

48
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,990
And I was like, oh shit, nice.

49
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:14,850
Alright, so, I am- I think it's safe to admit that I have a really, really, really big issue with Marvel Rivals in the terms of- I definitely have a problem.

50
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,230
I- King, thank you for the 1,000 bitties!

51
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,990
Thank you, thank you!

52
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,250
Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot to show.

53
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:27,890
If you don't know what Twitch Prime is, it's when you have to- You can subscribe to your favorite Twitch streamer for free!

54
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,930
As in me!

55
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,530
So you don't have to pay extra, because you already paid like, I don't know, 60 plus dollars to Amazon already.

56
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,750
So you might as well use that free Prime subscription!

57
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,590
Other than that, yes, I know it's like, super late at night now.

58
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,450
I did not celebrate Christmas Eve.

59
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:52,090
I never- Not never, but like, I didn't grow up celebrating the- Oh my god, I knew shilling works.

60
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,630
Look at all these Twitch Primes.

61
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,250
That's why it doesn't hurt to be a shameless shiller.

62
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,710
Oh, look at all that free money.

63
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,090
Damn, look at all that free- Thank you guys for the free money, I really appreciate it.

64
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,290
Pace, Lil, and Zman, and Tara, thank you for the Twitch Prime!

65
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,210
Thank you, thank you!

66
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:31,650
Anyway, so, we have basically two hours until it's Christmas, but I normally don't celebrate- I normally don't celebrate the holidays, because I didn't grow up celebrating the holidays.

67
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,870
So like, I don't see Christmas Eve, or Christmas, anything special, in general.

68
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,710
So like, it was funny, because I was like, where is everybody?

69
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,590
And then I forgot people, you know.

70
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:49,730
Normal people spend time with their family during this day, so that's why I was like, oh, so that's where people are.

71
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,730
Because I was like, waiting for people to be online to like, play Marvel Rivals for me.

72
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:01,470
Because I was like, I didn't wanna- I didn't wanna like, solo, because I was like, I hate soloing Marvel Rivals.

73
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,850
It's just- It's just way too painful.

74
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,290
Like, as a support player, soloing in Marvel Rivals as a support player is like, fucking terrible.

75
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,510
It's not fun at all.

76
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:21,230
And then, but like, um, if you're duoing with somebody, at least they share the exact same pain as you.

77
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,870
And then, at least it guarantees that you're not playing with another support player.

78
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,130
Like, that's really all I care about.

79
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,530
Like, I just want somebody to share- Oh my god, Quan!

80
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,090
QuanTumblr, thank you for the 10 gifted subs!

81
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,080
Thank you for the- wait, wait, is this the real Valorant?

82
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,460
Wait, wait a minute.

83
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:54,560
Wait a- wait a minute, let me- Oh, is Valorant giving bonus subs?

84
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:04,260
Oh, so like, does it mean that like, if you gift a sub, if you gift subs, then Valorant will give you- Oh, it's a Valorant!

85
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,600
I love how they're doing a Twitch promotion when I'm playing Marvel Rivals.

86
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Oh, they give free subs!

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,580
Guys, they give free- oh my god, I love free stuff.

88
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,920
They give five subs- okay, five subs for every five subs, I think.

89
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,280
Yeah, yeah, every five subs you do, they give the sub.

90
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,620
Oh, it's like bonus too!

91
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,540
Oh my god, let's farm Valorant!

92
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,780
Oh my god, thank you!

93
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,680
Hat and Clogs and Valorant and Ramiel for the gifted subs, thank you, thank you!

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,380
Oh my god, nice, we're gonna farm Valorant.

95
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,120
Guys, they have enough money already.

96
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,380
One skin is like fucking $40, and like, we know people are farming that skin right now.

97
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,260
Medi, thank you for the five gifted subs, thank you, thank you!

98
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,660
Tron, thank you for the five gifted subs, thank you, thank you!

99
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,380
Guys, it's okay, like, if anything, this is like nothing to them, honestly.

100
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,900
This is like nothing to them.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,900
They're actually trying to bribe you to play- it has to be like five, I think.

102
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,680
Yeah, five subs triggers the gifted.

103
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,620
Tron girl, Nexi, thank you for the five gifted subs, thank you, thank you!

104
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,460
But yeah, normally I don't- I don't celebrate, uh...

105
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,060
I normally don't celebrate, uh...

106
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,520
Oh my god, thank you guys!

107
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,480
Kaz, Mike, thank- buddy!

108
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,320
Oh my- yes, take all their- take their skin money.

109
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:49,420
Honestly, like, what we farm from Valorant- from the Valorant gifted promotion is like literally 0.1% of what they make in general.

110
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,900
From one- one skin, from one skin that they release, it's...

111
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,620
It's 0.1% of their wallet.

112
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,860
Fever, thank you for the five gifted subs!

113
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,640
And, uh...

114
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,220
Psycure, and Fillion, and, uh...

115
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,080
Pitesize!

116
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,120
Thank you so much for the gifted subs, I really appreciate it.

117
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,960
Thank you guys so much, thank you for the love!

118
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,080
Merry Christmas and Christmas Eve to all my Dragoons!

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:25,020
But yes, like I said, I normally don't celebrate the holidays, because my family never really celebrated the holidays.

120
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,140
Especially Christmas.

121
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,300
At best, like, I never really got, like, Christmas presents.

122
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,220
My parents would just be like, here's some money, or like, oh hey, what do you want?

123
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,080
And then they'll just, like, if I say I want something, they just buy it for me.

124
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,420
Uh, like...

125
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,120
I think, like, after Christmas.

126
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,560
So, like, I never really saw it as, like, anything, like, special special.

127
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,640
Um, and then sometimes there's a Christmas dinner, and sometimes there's, like, Christmas buffet.

128
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
And sometimes there isn't.

129
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,180
But it was just never, like, a super special holiday for me, because, like, I never really...

130
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,620
Um, I never really had a chance to actually celebrate the holidays.

131
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,280
And also, I live alone.

132
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,160
So, like, you know, like, what do I do?

133
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,060
I walked my dog.

134
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,820
I, like, woke up.

135
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,600
And then, like, did my... did, like, work stuff.

136
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,400
And then walked Doki Amber Doge.

137
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,060
And then, like, took a nap, because I was waiting for people to be online.

138
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,520
And then I woke up, and then nobody was online, because it's goddamn Christmas Eve.

139
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,660
I can't believe it.

140
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,080
People would rather spend time with family than grind...

141
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,660
Than get... than do the grind.

142
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,280
I'm not dedicated enough.

143
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
You know what I'm saying?

144
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,610
Like...

145
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,690
Oh my god.

146
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,370
They're not dedicated like I am.

147
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,570
To Marvel Rivals.

148
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,390
How fucking dare they.

149
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,270
If you don't pick Marvel Rivals over your family, then you're not... you're not in it.

150
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,910
You're not in it for real.

151
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,070
Whoa.

152
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,250
How dare they.

153
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,510
They don't like... they don't love rivals like I do.

154
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,510
That's a weird way to pronounce addicted.

155
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,730
Lacrosse says thank you for the 10 gifted subs.

156
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,970
And OshieSpark, thank you for the 5 gifted.

157
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,190
And Pelo and C.

158
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,250
Sensetsu and Quantz.

159
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,570
And Minler and Vivrian, thank you so much for the gifted subs.

160
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,430
Thank you, thank you.

161
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,930
Yes, I am a true FPS geek.

162
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,490
This is why I'm a... even though this is a third person, this is exactly why I'm a third person.

163
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,250
I'm your FPS VTuber of the year.

164
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,770
I am that dedicated to the grind.

165
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,750
Get a VTuber that's willing to grind Marvel Rivals on fucking Christmas Eve.

166
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,810
I would totally play Marvel Rivals on Christmas.

167
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,930
But then I realized that maybe you guys aren't into that.

168
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,550
I was thinking about it.

169
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,270
I was like, do I do it?

170
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:57,910
I was like, no.

171
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,350
No, I shouldn't.

172
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,410
I was like, I shouldn't do this to the dragoons.

173
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,470
I shouldn't.

174
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,530
I literally played Marvel Rivals at the concert.

175
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,110
I shouldn't.

176
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,750
That's a little bit too much.

177
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,210
That's a little... that's a little bit too fucking much.

178
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,830
Maybe I shouldn't do that.

179
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,790
So like, I legitimately, I could play Marvel Rivals and stream Marvel Rivals every day for the next month.

180
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,490
Like, until the season is over.

181
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,610
Guys, I just need you to know, this is only because it's season one.

182
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,950
The moment season one is over, I'll be okay.

183
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,450
It's just that season one... season one, I need to be top 500 in season one.

184
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,250
You don't understand.

185
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,150
You don't understand.

186
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,570
It's the first season.

187
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,010
Like, I have to be top 500.

188
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,110
It's season...

189
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,050
The first season, I have to be top 500.

190
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,930
Like, you don't understand.

191
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,510
Like, that's where my... that's why I can't stop.

192
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,150
Like, that's exactly why I can't stop.

193
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,670
It's like the first season.

194
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,270
So like, I'm too far gone.

195
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,430
I have to be on the leaderboards, guys.

196
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,830
Like, I'm desperate.

197
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,810
I really need to be on the leaderboards.

198
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,670
Chat, I...

199
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,610
So after the season is over, I'll return back to normal.

200
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,550
Like, things will be okay again.

201
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,810
Like, my head can't do variety.

202
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,350
But like, I forced myself this week to do variety.

203
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,550
Because I was like, Yo, could you really want to lose like 80% of your audience?

204
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,710
Is this how you want to ruin your career?

205
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,070
For Marvel Rivals?

206
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,070
And then the 50% side of me was like, It'll be... yeah.

207
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,930
Sorry, no.

208
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,450
The 49% of me was like, You know what?

209
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,350
Would it be that bad?

210
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,270
But then the 51% side of me was like, No, you shouldn't.

211
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,110
That's a little...

212
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,790
No.

213
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,570
After everything you've built, Doki, You're really going to ruin your career for Marvel Rivals.

214
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,430
So I was like, Okay, okay.

215
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,330
You gotta put some variety this week, Doki.

216
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,850
You gotta do some variety stuff this week.

217
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,990
Also like, Tomorrow, I originally had something special planned for Christmas.

218
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,390
Like a special upload.

219
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,710
But the video ended up not being done in time.

220
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,930
Because there was a lot of edits I wanted to do.

221
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,770
And obviously, They couldn't make it in time for the Christmas upload.

222
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,350
Because they wanted to spend time with family.

223
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,050
And it was a hard decision.

224
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,330
I was like, I don't want to force them to work days before Christmas.

225
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,770
And oh my god, look it's...

226
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,310
Oh my god!

227
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,530
Oh my god!

228
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,030
Thank

229
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,140
you!

230
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,720
Thank you for farming Valorant for me.

231
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,820
I really appreciate it.

232
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,060
I really appreciate us farming Valorant.

233
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,500
Maybe at one point, we'll hit the 1% of the Valorant wallet.

234
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,820
Oh my god, thank you again!

235
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,160
Anyway, so...

236
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,520
So I was like, No, Doki, you should...

237
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,980
You should not...

238
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,560
You should play other games, you know?

239
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,580
You should play stuff that, you know...

240
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,840
The Dragoons actually want to watch you play.

241
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,460
And I was like, alright.

242
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,700
We'll add variety.

243
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,620
I'll scratch my Marvel Rivals itch off stream.

244
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,420
I hope I end top 500.

245
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,880
I really do.

246
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,060
Because like, I'm trying.

247
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,860
I'm trying.

248
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm trying.

249
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,080
But I've been getting games.

250
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,360
I legit...

251
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,840
Okay, so for those who don't know.

252
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,080
I've been playing with other streamers, but I don't stream.

253
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,280
Because I get really distracted when I'm streaming.

254
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,020
AKA, I'm streaming right now.

255
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,400
But I'm going to get super distracted when I'm streaming ranked.

256
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,440
So when I'm playing off stream, I'm more focused up.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,300
So I had several...

258
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,040
I had a game.

259
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,480
We actually bumped into people.

260
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,540
If they're losing, they would DDOS the server.

261
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,380
They would DDOS the server.

262
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,960
So they won't lose any rank points.

263
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,020
It was so fucking crazy.

264
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,260
And then my team called them out.

265
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,800
Like, we got them on our team.

266
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,780
The next game.

267
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,840
And then we called them out.

268
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,860
And they're like, I don't know what you're talking about.

269
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,520
We don't do that.

270
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,340
It's not me.

271
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

272
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,120
And then because we called them out.

273
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,240
They didn't DDOS the server for the second game.

274
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,220
Because we were about to win.

275
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,600
And then our servers got DDOS'd.

276
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,500
And then people on our team was calling out that guy.

277
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,300
And then like...

278
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,040
And then we called them out the next game.

279
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,980
Because we got them on our team.

280
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,980
And we were intentionally not trying.

281
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,520
Because we were like, fuck you guys.

282
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,800
Because apparently, they got into Shroud's game several times.

283
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,580
And kept DDOSing the server when they were losing the Shroud.

284
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,420
And then so like...

285
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,060
So we knew that it was them.

286
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,640
Because chat was telling us.

287
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,740
The chat was telling my friends.

288
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,400
Who I was playing with.

289
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,540
That they were purposely DDOSing the servers.

290
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,260
For Shroud's games.

291
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,460
And then so we called them out on it.

292
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,260
On our game.

293
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,680
And then they were like, oh we were talking about.

294
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,100
We didn't DDOS the server.

295
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,180
And they were three stacking too.

296
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,580
One of the DDOSers was three stacking with two other people.

297
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,020
They were so fucking bad.

298
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,280
Because they literally can't lose.

299
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,160
They only win from...

300
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,500
They don't DDOS when they win.

301
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,340
So they were so fucking bad.

302
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,020
Because they were so easy to kill.

303
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,960
Because they don't have any game sense at all.

304
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,520
Because they are literally climbing from DDOSing the servers.

305
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,560
And then.

306
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,800
Because they don't lose anything when the servers get shut down.

307
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,640
So when we called them out.

308
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,320
They were like, woah I don't know what you are talking about.

309
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,800
And then they don't DDOS the servers.

310
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,620
So they were like, see we lost it and the servers aren't DDOSed.

311
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,020
And we were like, are you fucking kidding me.

312
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,420
Because they were like.

313
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,180
Woah look at that.

314
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,380
Now you lost points.

315
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,620
And we were like, do you think we fucking care.

316
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,960
We can get our points back so easily.

317
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,880
Well not me.

318
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,740
My friends.

319
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,380
Not me because I'm a support player.

320
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,460
But my friends were like, do you think we care.

321
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,120
It was a sacrifice I had to make.

322
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,320
It was a sacrifice.

323
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,800
I had to make.

324
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,940
But my friends were like, do you think.

325
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,580
Do you think we care.

326
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,740
We can get our points back.

327
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,220
Me I was like, well I can.

328
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,760
But like, yeah fuck you guys.

329
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,260
I was just like, not me.

330
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,100
But like, yeah.

331
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,420
I care.

332
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
But like, yeah fuck you guys.

333
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,000
Doki in the background.

334
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,900
I care.

335
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,780
I care about my rank points.

336
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,640
So yeah.

337
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,420
So basically those are like.

338
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,700
My adventures.

339
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,480
Of more of a rival ring so far.

340
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,140
Oh yeah, also story time.

341
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,340
I'll talk about this tomorrow.

342
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,500
But like today I walked dad.

343
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,040
I walked dad, Doki and Brioge today.

344
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,740
And then like.

345
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,360
What happened was that he found.

346
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:03,980
Another.

347
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,540
There was another dog in front of us.

348
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,100
And he was so excited.

349
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,980
And then he was a tiny dog.

350
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,000
He's ok with tiny dogs.

351
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,520
Because he's like, I'm bigger than you.

352
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,060
So like, I'm in charge.

353
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,200
So like basically what happened.

354
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
Was that, he, also.

355
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,180
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

356
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,060
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

357
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:43,560
So basically they were he was sniffing him and then like he was like Yippee another dog and then like he didn't bark at him So I was really happy because it was like honestly some 80 80 20% whether he's gonna bark at them or not 20% of him not barking at them because he's a wiener dog.

358
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,900
So every dog is technically bigger than him.

359
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,140
Anyway, so What happened was that?

360
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,820
basically uh He was sniffing the other dog and he's like

361
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,000
He sniffed him and then he tried to pee on him I was like

362
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,660
NOT NEAR GRANDSON!

363
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,280
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

364
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,420
I was like, PLEASE!

365
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,160
Oh my god, if it were near Grandson it would make sense, but then he tried to PEE ON THE OTHER SMALLER DOG!

366
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,520
And obviously, the other smaller dog instantly backed off and was like, What the fuck?

367
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,580
What the fuck, you fucking freak!

368
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,500
Like, yeah!

369
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:55,120
That is so... bro wanted to claim and he's like, You're smaller than me, you're mine now!

370
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,480
Like, he's so fucking freaky!

371
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,040
That was the first time!

372
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,080
I've never seen him done that before on any other dog before!

373
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,060
This is the first time he tried to pee on another dog!

374
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,340
I didn't know what to do, I was like, I'm so...

375
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,800
And I walked away, I'm like, I'm so sorry!

376
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,600
And then I pulled him and I just walked away, cause I was like, what do I say?

377
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,980
Like, I'm like, what do I do after that?

378
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,180
And I just walked away!

379
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,040
I didn't know what else to do!

380
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,980
He's just like... I don't even know what the owner said, I was so embarrassed!

381
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,000
I literally was like, no!

382
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,440
And then I walked away cause I don't know what else to do!

383
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,320
I was like, this is... this is not it!

384
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,860
This is not it!

385
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,840
Um, but yeah, anyway, like I said, I bumped into like, so many...

386
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,640
Um, I bumped into so many support players, I would get like, three to four support mains on my own team.

387
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:07,580
So I have to like, play with other people to guarantee that I have someone that is not a support player.

388
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,520
Like, I can't, I legitimately can't.

389
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,480
This is like, solo queue hell for me.

390
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,340
There's so many support mains in high elo, I can't.

391
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,460
Like, where did you guys...

392
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,880
Why are you in my lobbies?

393
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,640
And then my friends would be like, how do you get so many support players?

394
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,100
All I get were DPS players.

395
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,180
And I'm like, bro, I wish I just get DPS players.

396
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,240
Bro, I've been avoiding, I use my voice chat for support players cause I'm so tired!

397
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,260
I'm so tired of getting support, other support mains on my team!

398
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,860
I'm so tired.

399
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,720
So, so I have to like, I actually like, avoid support players and I only get three slots too.

400
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,100
Also like, a lot of people recognize me in high elo, it's crazy.

401
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,460
They're like, is this the real DokiBrit?

402
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,320
Oh my god, Doki, is this you?

403
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,640
Sometimes I don't say anything and then sometimes I grease them with my, with a response.

404
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,960
Sometimes, sometimes I don't know all people if they ask me if it's me and then sometimes I'm like, I feel nice today.

405
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,720
So like, I don't say anything so they'll always be like, oh my god, is it?

406
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,520
Or like, is it really her or is it not her?

407
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,840
Will I ever know?

408
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,640
And then I like to have them like, think about that.

409
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,280
They'll be like, even though like, technically you can't have, you can't have the same name.

410
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,820
So like, so like, it's obviously me because you can't share a name.

411
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:48,980
But like, if they can't, if they ask me if I'm the real Doki and they still don't recognize the fact that I'm literally the only one that owns the tag DokiBrit, then they deserve to be DonaWald.

412
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:56,520
They, they, they deserve to be DonaWald.

413
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:07,510
If they like, are absolute that they know it's 100% me, then I'll be like, ah yes, then you definitely watch me.

414
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,190
That's so true.

415
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,110
If they're like, if they're like, is that the real you?

416
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,590
Then you're getting DonaWald.

417
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,530
We would never, exactly, you would never make, you would never hesitate.

418
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,030
If you're a real Dragoon, you won't hesitate.

419
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,270
You would know it's me.

420
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:43,470
Also like, um, I've had several, okay, so I bumped into people in my team or like, um, against me and they would be like, um, oh my god, Doki, I'm a huge fan.

421
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:49,070
Can like, can like, um, can you say, like, can I respond or something like on my team?

422
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,810
Or like, they'll be like, oh, can I have you added?

423
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,450
And I would be like, if we lose this game, I'm banning you from my chat.

424
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,970
And then we lose, I'd be like, sorry, I'm, guess, guess you're banned.

425
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,140
And then, and then, no pressure or anything.

426
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,460
No, no pressure.

427
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:32,640
And then, and then, and then if I get them on my team again, they'll be like, please, please, can we, can, please, am I banned?

428
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,320
And I was like, if we win this game, I'll unban you.

429
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,620
Clutch or ban.

430
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,560
And then if I get farmed by a Dragoon, I'd be like, I'm fucking banned.

431
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:53,240
And then if I get farmed by a Dragoon and they say something in the match chat, I'd be like, well, guess I'm banning you.

432
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,900
I was like, how dare you, how dare you farm me.

433
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,880
Real Tokyo behavior, that's what happens if you acknowledge me.

434
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,660
There is no justice.

435
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,320
That's what happens.

436
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,600
The rank warrants are that serious, guys.

437
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,180
I am that committed to the grind.

438
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,040
How dare you farm me.

439
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,380
But yeah, that's how it's been going so far.

440
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,680
I love my role rivals.

441
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,100
Honestly, I've never been this addicted to a competitive shooter in a fucking long ass time.

442
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,820
So this is like, I'm feeling the passion right now.

443
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,600
Also, now I can play other characters because Luna Snow keeps getting banned.

444
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,960
They always ban Mantis and Luna Snow now.

445
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,400
So now I can actually play lowkey, guys.

446
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:59,440
I can actually, I'm feeling way less bad about Tokyo's queue time now.

447
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,800
These two are like always banned.

448
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,660
So now I can play lowkey, I don't know how to play Adam yet, but apparently he's also really, really good.

449
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,960
I can play lowkey, Rocky Raccoon and Cloak and Dagger.

450
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,260
I'm still learning Adam.

451
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,220
Yeah, people ban supports on high elo.

452
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,700
Because there's literally, these two are the only defensive ults.

453
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,180
These two are the only ones that can save the team.

454
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:33,320
If any of these characters ult, we have these two to save the team.

455
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:43,500
But because they ban these two, all these characters with the 5 million fucking aggression ults can kill all of us.

456
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:52,320
So it's whoever team, whichever team does their aggressive fucking ults first and we don't have a defensive ult.

457
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,380
And it's fucking terrible.

458
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,940
Yes, Cloak and Dagger ult is insane.

459
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,000
But like, the thing is, people don't stand on her ult sometimes.

460
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,860
That's the issue.

461
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,040
People don't stand on her ult.

462
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,400
Like, there's like, stand here and they don't stand here.

463
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,420
Like, it's just stand there.

464
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,880
That's all you do.

465
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,700
But they don't.

466
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,620
They run away.

467
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,600
And I'll be like, look at this blue area.

468
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,440
Stand in the blue.

469
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:33,860
Like, stand, like, like, basically you can outlive so much stuff if you stand here.

470
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,020
That's all you need to do.

471
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,160
Stand here.

472
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,320
But yeah, that's really all I want to rant about.

473
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Let me check.

474
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,280
Let me check if people are...

475
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,420
All right.

476
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,120
All right.

477
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,240
Let me see.

478
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,120
All right.

479
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,260
Let me see if anybody is online to play right now.

480
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,780
If not, we're going to lose our GM2 on solo queue.

481
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,060
Okay, that's my life update.

482
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,980
So yeah, I've been enjoying the break a lot.

483
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,160
Because I get to play Marvel Rivals.

484
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,920
Sorry, I did get some work done.

485
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,260
I got some work done.

486
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,360
But like, also, I have been playing Marvel Rivals like 10 plus hours a day.

487
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,480
Which is really nice because I was like, yippee!

488
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,500
I did, but they were like, oh yeah, message around this time if they're ready.

489
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,940
So, um, so I've been going to sleep at like 6 to 8 a.m.

490
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,340
every day since I had my break.

491
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,820
I'm sorry, I have a problem.

492
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,280
I can't help it.

493
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,060
And so I really like Marvel Rivals.

494
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,180
I'm sorry.

495
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,820
I just, I just really, really like Marvel Rivals, guys.

496
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,440
I just, I just, I'm that committed to the grind, everybody.

497
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,200
I know, I have a problem.

498
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,680
Time is like non-existent anymore to me.

499
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,240
But I wish I could get sponsored by Marvel Rivals.

500
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,860
I wish I can...

501
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,560
Wait, do I have drops on this?

502
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,160
Because I feel like everybody's like, drops?

503
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,560
Let me check.

504
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll look at drops again.

505
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,740
Okay, drops.

506
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
Is there, do I have Marvel Rivals drops?

507
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,900
I don't know if that's like for everybody.

508
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,900
Oh, there it is.

509
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,940
Oh, it is enabled.

510
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,160
By the way, I have drops.

511
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,020
It's enabled.

512
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,100
I don't really know what it does.

513
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,700
I don't really...

514
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,660
Oh, you get sprays.

515
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,680
I don't really care about sprays.

516
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,900
But like, you guys care about...

517
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,520
I care, okay.

518
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,460
But if Marvel Rivals sponsors me, I care so much about sprays.

519
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,340
I...

520
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,240
And the Magneto skin.

521
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:53,900
Oh, shit.

522
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,400
And the Magneto skin.

523
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,520
If I get sponsored by Marvel Rivals, I will buy the Battle Pass.

524
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,740
That's how dedicated I am.

525
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,580
I will buy the Battle Pass if I get sponsored by Marvel Rivals.

526
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:11,970
I love Marvel.

527
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,550
Okay, like, but I'm literally like...

528
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:21,010
Okay, I feel like I converted so many people into playing this game because like of my fucking addiction.

529
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:30,990
During my meet and greet at Holiday Matsuri, people like went up to me and was like, oh my god, like I got into Marvel Rivals because of you.

530
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:38,210
And I was like, oh my god, I'm like so addicted because like watching you play Marvel Rivals and then it got me into it, so into it.

531
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,170
And I'd be like, oh, I'm so sorry.

532
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,710
I feel like I'm like the...

533
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,410
I told you, I said this before.

534
00:31:46,590 --> 00:32:00,910
I don't know if I said this at the panel during Holiday Matsuri, but I was just like, I feel like I'm like that picture on the cigarette carton on the packaging where like, don't smoke because this is what happens to you, but people still buy it.

535
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,190
That's me right now.

536
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,410
Don't, don't play Marvel Rivals or you get super addicted just like her.

537
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:21,170
And the people still, people are like, oh my god, like, um, people...

538
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:26,950
Oh my god, oh my god, get it now.

539
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:36,110
Okay, okay, one of my, one of my friends was like, I don't have a, they're like, I don't have a name change right now.

540
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,190
They're like, I don't know if I want to play today.

541
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,770
I don't have a name change.

542
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,190
And I was like, how bad could it be?

543
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,610
Oh my god.

544
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,350
Okay, I understand now.

545
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,110
I can't understand.

546
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,830
Okay, all right.

547
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,010
Because like, it's like seven days.

548
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,210
They're like, I don't know what we should play on.

549
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:12,730
I'm like, I don't know what I should play on stream because I don't, I don't have a name change at the moment.

550
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,770
Oh my god, I'm the only GM too?

551
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,570
That's gonna be rough, buddy.

552
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,950
Oh my god, okay.

553
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,890
That's fine.

554
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,910
That's fine, we're fine.

555
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,930
Oh my god, oh my god, I'm batting.

556
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,950
Okay, Hela and then Hawkeye.

557
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,310
Hela and then Hawkeye.

558
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,330
No, there is, hero bands are in Diamond Up.

559
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,990
I'm so fine.

560
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,170
And then, oh, they got Hawkeye.

561
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,390
Um, we'll ban, uh, Dr. Strange, actually.

562
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,510
Dr. Strange.

563
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,810
Yeah, Dr. Strange.

564
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,210
No, it's like Diamond and Up, so...

565
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,230
Um, so it should be okay.

566
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,390
I hope they don't ban Psylocke.

567
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,510
Um, Strange is so broken.

568
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,870
Oh, they banned Psylocke.

569
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,570
Okay, that's...

570
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,070
Okay, that's fine.

571
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,330
That's fine.

572
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,770
That's totally okay.

573
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,250
The reason why I was like, I hope they don't ban Psylocke is because my duo plays, I mean, Psylocke.

574
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,150
Oh my god.

575
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,870
And so I was like, oh man, that'd be pretty rough.

576
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,390
But like, they can flex.

577
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,940
All right, 1, 2, 3, thank you for the...

578
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,490
For the donation.

579
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,630
Thank you, thank you.

580
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,390
Um, I'm one button away from purchasing a very nice PC case.

581
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,690
But you be convinced on hitting the pay button because I have way too many PC case.

582
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,090
Am I gonna regret this midnight purchase or will I be able to just...

583
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,890
Okay, but like, does the PC case have my face on it?

584
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,150
I feel like that's justification enough.

585
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,330
It has my face on it.

586
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,030
I'd rather they ban a healer because I can flex.

587
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,550
Like, that's right, exactly.

588
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,310
And when it's...

589
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,590
We have like, technically, it's limited edition.

590
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,650
So when all the stock is gone, it's gone forever.

591
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,930
So that's all I'm saying.

592
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,930
Um, do you really want to get FOMO'd?

593
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:31,670
Do you?

594
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,410
All right, do we have one?

595
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,790
Okay, I'm gonna put it on the story.

596
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,070
All right.

597
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,070
All right, guys.

598
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,530
It's okay, guys.

599
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,690
If we lose, we're not GM2 anymore.

600
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,650
That's okay.

601
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,810
I've accepted it.

602
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,090
I've acce...

603
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,110
Guys, it's okay.

604
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,430
I'm okay, we don't...

605
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,450
Oh, I shouldn't have pressed shift.

606
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,350
I'm like, I'm already throwing, technically.

607
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,850
I'm actually throwing already.

608
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,850
That's fine.

609
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,050
Groot.

610
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,750
I am Groot.

611
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,610
I am Groot.

612
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,170
I am Groot.

613
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,570
I am Groot.

614
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,350
Please.

615
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,230
Please, let me see you.

616
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,670
Let me see you!

617
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,490
I am Groot.

618
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,110
Nice.

619
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:31,630
I need to not play against Groot players or play with Groot players because literally every time I have a Groot player on my team, in my head, I'm just like, I am Groot.

620
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,150
I am Groot.

621
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,890
I am Groot.

622
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,270
Like, I can't...

623
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,690
I can't help it.

624
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,490
It's like, literal brain rot.

625
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,530
Like, for me, all I want to say is just, I am Groot.

626
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:51,330
And like, when I play off stream, my duos would be like, please stop.

627
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,050
Please stop.

628
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,370
I can't.

629
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,530
But I can't.

630
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,310
I'm so...

631
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,990
I can't stop.

632
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,830
Oh, fuck!

633
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,170
Okay.

634
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,550
All right.

635
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,590
Nice.

636
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,170
Get in my dance.

637
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,870
I'm dancing.

638
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,110
Oh, I'm fucking, I'm fucking, I'm dancing my heart out.

639
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,230
We're

640
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
forced into it.

641
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,440
Oh my god, we're actually in the fucking Cloak and Dagger ult.

642
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,280
Just cause we're forced into it by Groot.

643
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,000
Thank fucking god.

644
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,480
Guys, no heals.

645
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,660
No heals.

646
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,100
Oh my god.

647
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,760
Please, we have no heals.

648
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,260
Don't do this to me.

649
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,840
We have Nidalee for so long.

650
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,160
What the fuck, you're a killer.

651
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,520
Please.

652
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,060
I am Groot.

653
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
Okay, I don't wanna...

654
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,600
I'm not looking back.

655
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm not gonna look back.

656
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,800
Okay.

657
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,540
There we go, he's low.

658
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,000
As long as I don't look back, we're fine.

659
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,700
All right, nice.

660
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,020
Yay, yippee.

661
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,620
I almost said Overwatch.

662
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,880
I love Marvel rivals.

663
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,940
Go, Groot, go.

664
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,480
There we go.

665
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,920
We did it.

666
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,320
Oh my god, Sylvanas, thank you for the 50 gifted subs.

667
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,900
Thank you, thank you.

668
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,880
Thank you so much.

669
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,480
I really appreciate it.

670
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,980
Thank you for farming Valorant subs for me.

671
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:44,720
I...

672
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,020
They have too much money, so let's just farm it all.

673
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,440
Unlike Amazon, who's like, going negative from buying Twitch.

674
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,060
I should say that clearly on Twitch.

675
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,380
Like, you know how like, Twitch did that special promotion too?

676
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,940
But like, you guys didn't know.

677
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,760
Amazon's literally losing money with Twitch because it's not sustainable.

678
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,900
Because like, having a platform is like, not...

679
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,240
It's not as sustainable as you think it is.

680
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,320
But Valorant is very sustainable, so...

681
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,760
At least like, Valorant's not losing money from this.

682
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,820
I mean, YouTube...

683
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,760
It took YouTube like, years before it became profitable.

684
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,520
Uh, because like, buying servers is like, so expensive in general.

685
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,660
We have Black Panther?

686
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,920
I think like, Twitch for them is just like, an...

687
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,500
Oh shit, okay, we got it.

688
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,160
Oh my god!

689
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,220
Oh my god!

690
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,240
Oh no!

691
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,360
They have a Wolverine!

692
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,460
Oh!

693
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,520
Bro, they're so armed!

694
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,200
We can't let this guy die.

695
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,220
If he dies, he gets it again.

696
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,560
We can't.

697
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,860
We can't let that happen.

698
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,500
Wait, where's our Thor?

699
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm dead.

700
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,120
I'm so dead.

701
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,580
I dropped!

702
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,080
No!

703
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,240
I accidentally dropped!

704
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,740
Oh, it's because our Thor swapped!

705
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,040
I got like, Wolverine jumpscared into falling down.

706
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,320
Why the fuck did our other tank swap?

707
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,800
We were doing so well!

708
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,740
Sorry, I got like, I legitimately got like, jumpscared from...

709
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,060
From the Groot, so like, it fucked me up.

710
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,160
It actually like, fucked me up.

711
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,920
I was just like, what the fuck was that?

712
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,660
Did he get anything?

713
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,120
I don't- I don't even know.

714
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,160
Oh shit, I'm backing up.

715
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,680
Oh, I'm backing up.

716
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,100
This is why I don't normally stream ranking.

717
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,600
I get so distracted in general.

718
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,020
Um...

719
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,180
We really just need another tank.

720
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,160
That's- That's really it.

721
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:09,740
What happened?

722
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Is it Glenn?

723
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,240
Glenn.

724
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,540
Glenn, buddy.

725
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,280
You were doing great on Thor.

726
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:15,980
Like, what?

727
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,380
Were you like, you know what?

728
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,680
Fuck having an easy game to win.

729
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,180
You know?

730
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,860
Fuck that shit.

731
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,740
I don't want to fucking win this easily.

732
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,620
Jesus.

733
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,200
Okay.

734
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,560
Okay.

735
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,540
Are we okay?

736
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,560
Are we- We're so healthy.

737
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,860
We're- We're so okay.

738
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,500
We're- We're so okay.

739
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,660
Please, just- It's just Magneto.

740
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:45,800
Please.

741
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,900
Now it's just Wolverine.

742
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,420
Okay.

743
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,260
Thank- Okay, we used a bit too many ults there.

744
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,820
We- You okay, Grunt?

745
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,260
Are you okay?

746
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,600
What's the real challenge?

747
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,460
He was like, no, that- That game was way too- That round was too easy.

748
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,500
I want to earn my rank here.

749
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:16,820
Bro, I'm here for- Okay, like, some of my friends, they were like, Oh man, I'm happy when the games are just good.

750
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,400
But I'm like, I'm not.

751
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,620
They're like, uh, when the game's like, real- They're like, oh man.

752
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,660
I wish- Oh my god, bro.

753
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,940
Oh my god.

754
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:35,220
I'm just- Oh my god, as long as you're- I can't- I can't- No!

755
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,840
I can't keep you alive anymore!

756
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,100
I- I can't!

757
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,820
Just- I can't keep you alive anymore!

758
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,640
Oh my god!

759
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,340
They're like- They're like, oh man, I told my friends, it would be like, I don't like easy games.

760
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,100
I like- It's so boring.

761
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,000
And I was like, I like winning.

762
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,840
I was like, I don't fucking care.

763
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,760
I don't care if it's easy.

764
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,780
I like winning.

765
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,080
Like-

766
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,760
Again, true.

767
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,380
I don't care.

768
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,780
They're like, man, when games get too easy.

769
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,180
It's so boring.

770
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,580
Or like- Or like, man.

771
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,160
And then like, I get crazy.

772
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,840
If it's like, win-loss, win-loss, win-loss.

773
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,340
I get fucking crazy.

774
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,980
Because I was like, it's so frustrating.

775
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,180
But then, my friends would be like, man, like, the games are good though.

776
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,400
Like, I'm like- Wish games were easier.

777
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,480
Winning above all.

778
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,660
A win is a win.

779
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,540
Oh, now he plays Thor!

780
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,140
Okay!

781
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,360
Okay, buddy!

782
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,920
Oh, fucking K!

783
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,020
He's like, alright, now it's a real challenge.

784
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,460
Now, this round, this game is an actual challenge.

785
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,540
Let me play another tank now.

786
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,200
Went over having fun.

787
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,720
Yes, a real game.

788
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,220
He's just like, now, now it's fine.

789
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,300
Yeah, we'll bring the second Seer for the tanks.

790
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,920
I'm gonna wait.

791
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,260
I don't care about good games.

792
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,220
I just wanna win.

793
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,220
A game is good when I win.

794
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,740
That's basically it.

795
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,680
If the game is- Is he alive?

796
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,480
Wait, he's alive!

797
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,680
What happened there?

798
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,640
I was like, what the fuck happened there?

799
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,230
God, he's alive!

800
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,230
I'm just going to hide.

801
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:03,730
Whoa!

802
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:04,710
No!

803
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,440
Oh my god!

804
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,280
I didn't mean to fucking hit that!

805
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,540
I'm so sad!

806
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,180
I'm so fucking sad!

807
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,800
Let's try to fucking get cover!

808
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,120
Oh my god, that's terrible!

809
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,360
I'm so depressed!

810
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,980
Oh my god.

811
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,240
That was absolutely depressing for me.

812
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,540
That was so depressing!

813
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,580
Oh my god.

814
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,440
Groot, please, Groot.

815
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,180
You're gonna take a million fucking damage over there, Groot.

816
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,160
I'm so fucking scared for you.

817
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,760
I'm mad!

818
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,320
Goodbye.

819
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,600
I don't live there anymore!

820
00:45:59,940 --> 00:45:59,960
I don't live there anymore!

821
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,860
You can have...

822
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,860
You can have the area.

823
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,540
Where...

824
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,880
Oh, he killed two!

825
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,040
Why are you up there?

826
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,700
Oh my god!

827
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Guys, please!

828
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,400
Oh, the double support!

829
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,260
Oh, no!

830
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,380
Oh my god!

831
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,180
Oh, where am I?

832
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,520
Where am I?

833
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,840
I don't know!

834
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,580
Oh my god.

835
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,540
I couldn't tell where I am anymore.

836
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,680
All right, that's fine.

837
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,460
Someone needs a snowball in the face.

838
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,380
That's fine.

839
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,880
Everything is so A-okay.

840
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,620
Everything is...

841
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,400
Oh, no.

842
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,540
Oh, no, that's a lot of...

843
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,880
Okay, I froze Magneto.

844
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,340
Can we do anything with that?

845
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,260
I'm scared of, you know...

846
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:55,160
That...

847
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,740
That was unfortunate because nobody was actually near my ult when this happened.

848
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,860
Wait, what?

849
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,860
Okay, just keep me up.

850
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,620
Just keep me up.

851
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm just gonna be over there.

852
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:06,820
All right.

853
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,880
Okay, Magneto.

854
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,400
I know you would like the thrill of almost losing, but like, Magneto, please.

855
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,140
Oh my god!

856
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:16,980
He's so low!

857
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,200
Please, just focus on him!

858
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,460
Oh my god!

859
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,420
He's so low also!

860
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:22,580
Please!

861
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,160
Oh, he actually gets healed!

862
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,240
What a freaking freak!

863
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,260
Oh, that's huge!

864
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

865
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,840
Oh my god, that's crazy.

866
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,180
We just gotta keep our Groot alive.

867
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,480
Damn!

868
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,500
Oh.

869
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,760
Guys, I don't know if we can keep our Groot alive anymore.

870
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,540
Is this worth it?

871
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,240
Oh, fuck.

872
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:01,600
Okay.

873
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,040
Oh!

874
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,220
I heard that too late.

875
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,280
That's fine!

876
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:05,880
I baited!

877
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,960
I baited Bucky ult!

878
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,560
It's fine!

879
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,480
I baited Bucky ult!

880
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,180
That's...

881
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,960
It's worth it.

882
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,320
It's so worth it.

883
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,220
It's fine!

884
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,520
We baited Bucky ult!

885
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,240
Haha, it's fine!

886
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,940
Okay.

887
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,080
They don't have Bucky ult.

888
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:29,980
That's fine.

889
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,440
Just don't die here.

890
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,220
Cause...

891
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,300
I think our Groot dies here.

892
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,180
I don't know why they peek when...

893
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,820
I don't know why our Groot...

894
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,060
Like, I don't know why.

895
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,260
Why did he peek?

896
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:46,540
Haha.

897
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,500
Oh my god.

898
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:50,980
Okay.

899
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,920
Okay.

900
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,600
This is last fight.

901
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,500
I can't...

902
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,560
I don't... I don't think I can build.

903
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,540
Guys, guys.

904
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,060
I don't feel comfortable in this choke point right now.

905
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,640
I...

906
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,680
I don't...

907
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,740
I don't feel comfortable.

908
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,780
Oh.

909
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,380
Guys, it was great being GM2 for a second.

910
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,620
What the fuck?

911
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,300
Why didn't we ult?

912
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,040
Why didn't we ult?

913
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,480
I don't understand.

914
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,660
The records.

915
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,880
Oh, that was actually...

916
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,880
Reports looking for not knowing.

917
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:40,820
Okay.

918
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:47,160
Oh my god.

919
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:47,960
Wait, I...

920
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,040
I don't know.

921
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,720
They were all terrible.

922
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,800
I'm not gonna lie.

923
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,880
They were all fucking terrible.

924
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,160
No, our...

925
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,260
Our Thor was pretty...

926
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:57,720
Our...

927
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,220
Our Thor was like, I'm gonna play DPS.

928
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,620
Like...

929
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,940
Like, he just made the game so much harder...

930
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,400
Than it needed to be.

931
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,180
Literally, he did not have to play fucking tank.

932
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,060
Yeah.

933
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,720
He's having a hard time during Christmas.

934
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,280
Yeah, he is.

935
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,400
All right.

936
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,720
That was...

937
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,140
Yeah.

938
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,780
Yeah, yeah.

939
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,040
That...

940
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,680
Guys, it was nice being like GM2 for like...

941
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,860
Like for two hours.

942
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,840
It was a good time.

943
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:42,780
I...

944
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,180
I had a great time being GM2 for two hours.

945
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:45,900
I...

946
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,900
Oh my god, there's so many people like I've like talked to.

947
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,460
I'm just gonna be like, Hey Drake, pick Kayder.

948
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,900
No Psylocke today.

949
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,900
Remember when...

950
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,660
Yeah, remember when we saw myself in GM2 for like...

951
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,660
A couple of seconds.

952
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,420
Those were the good old days.

953
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,920
I don't care what they ban.

954
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,320
I don't want Hawkeye on my fucking games.

955
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,240
I...

956
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,100
I can't.

957
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,500
No, it wasn't two hours because I slept, guys.

958
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,820
I slept and I was still GM2 because I didn't queue.

959
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,640
So technically, I was GM2 for like...

960
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,020
At least 10 hours.

961
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:35,880
I...

962
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,440
I was GM2 for at least 10 hours.

963
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,400
That's something.

964
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:48,150
Okay.

965
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:56,990
All right.

966
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,260
I like messaged my duo.

967
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,120
I was like, why are you not playing Psylocke?

968
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,720
Because like they're a Psylocke main.

969
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,360
And then they're like...

970
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,800
They're like, oh, I'm practicing new heroes.

971
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,160
Do you want to win or is it okay if I...

972
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,280
I was just like...

973
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,060
But if you want me to win...

974
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,900
I was like, can I get back GM2 first?

975
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,480
And then I was just like, can I get back GM2 first?

976
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,780
And then you can practice.

977
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,780
And then they're like, okay, but after this Ironman game...

978
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,060
They're like, okay, but after this Ironman game...

979
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,880
That's crazy.

980
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,200
Bro, you're getting greeted by everybody right now.

981
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,260
I was like, bro, Psylocke's finally not banned.

982
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,580
Why aren't you on Psylocke?

983
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,340
I fucking love that character.

984
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,540
Okay.

985
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,220
Oh.

986
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,640
Oh, that's fine.

987
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,580
That's not fine.

988
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,200
That's not fine.

989
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,940
That's not fine.

990
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,660
That's 100% not fine.

991
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,100
Oh my god.

992
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,420
My positioning is pretty bad right now.

993
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,200
Oh my god.

994
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,280
They have an Ironman as well, which is scary.

995
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:41,680
Okay.

996
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,280
Okay.

997
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:49,740
Yeah, we can't do anything about it because they have an Ironman with this fucking orb on it too.

998
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:49,880
Okay, here we go.

999
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,820
Holy shit!

1000
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,180
Okay.

1001
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,980
Alright, I froze him again.

1002
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,100
Come on!

1003
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,140
You should be out of mech now.

1004
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,380
Get him out of mech.

1005
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,320
Get him out of mech.

1006
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:04,820
Okay.

1007
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,920
I'm pushing up.

1008
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,020
It's so free!

1009
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,740
Where's my Ironman?

1010
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,380
There it is.

1011
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,740
There we go.

1012
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,280
Can't see you.

1013
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:18,800
Can't see you.

1014
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,560
No, he's out of mech form!

1015
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,060
Oh.

1016
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,000
Oh, I hit him.

1017
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,420
Oh, I even hit him too.

1018
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,120
Alright, here we go.

1019
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,420
Alright, get back in the mech.

1020
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,280
First banner.

1021
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,320
Back in that mech.

1022
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,940
My positioning is so garbage right now.

1023
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:41,740
Like...

1024
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,860
It's actually pretty bad positioning.

1025
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,360
I need to get better at positioning.

1026
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,900
There's just so many maps.

1027
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,720
So it's like...

1028
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,360
Oh my god.

1029
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:57,940
It's fine.

1030
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,820
Oh my god, it's an Ironman off.

1031
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,020
It's an Ironman off, but it's not even a 1v1.

1032
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,300
It's like...

1033
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,120
It's like a freaking...

1034
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,060
Trying to 1v1 and then the rest of us is just here.

1035
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,260
Oh, okay.

1036
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,520
Alright, that's fine.

1037
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:19,820
Yippee!

1038
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,360
Yippee!

1039
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,280
Let's...

1040
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:22,820
No!

1041
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,880
Oh my god, I'm alive.

1042
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,780
I'm alive.

1043
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,060
I'm so healthy.

1044
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,800
Oh my god, I'm so healthy.

1045
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:33,880
I'm not healthy anymore.

1046
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,980
I'm not healthy.

1047
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,780
Oh, that's like the scariest shit.

1048
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,360
It's fine.

1049
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,180
It's fine.

1050
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,560
This is an Ironman off again.

1051
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,740
Yo, Jarvan, don't clip that.

1052
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,720
Oh, it's fine.

1053
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,420
It's fine.

1054
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,440
We still have a support that's still alive.

1055
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:53,780
Alright.

1056
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,000
Guys, guys.

1057
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,460
Guys, they're sort of capping for free, guys.

1058
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,320
But that's okay.

1059
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,680
We all make mistakes here.

1060
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,280
Oh my god.

1061
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,680
Guys, I don't think he's okay.

1062
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:08,680
He's okay.

1063
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,820
He's okay.

1064
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,960
Oh my god, this is not...

1065
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,440
This is not...

1066
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,000
There's no hold.

1067
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,020
Sorry, I thought there was a...

1068
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,040
I forgot that there's a hold now.

1069
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,860
So I was like, don't worry, I have cover to...

1070
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,300
Dodge all that.

1071
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,860
I did not have cover.

1072
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,180
I did not have cover.

1073
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,260
I'm so bad at positioning on this map.

1074
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,440
I don't know how to position myself properly on this one.

1075
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,340
That's not how you position yourself.

1076
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,040
It's fine.

1077
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,120
Okay, I'm well up.

1078
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,520
Guys.

1079
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:52,860
Okay.

1080
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,700
That's fine.

1081
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,200
What am I getting hit by?

1082
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,460
What am I getting hit by?

1083
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,540
Okay, nice.

1084
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:03,900
There's a hold.

1085
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,360
I always forget the hold.

1086
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,620
I always...

1087
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,200
I always forget the fucking hold.

1088
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,440
Oh, they swapped a penny.

1089
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,420
Drivers clip that.

1090
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,260
I love all the Marvel Rivals memes.

1091
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,560
This is my favorite meme that I like sent to my friend.

1092
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,740
Because I thought it was...

1093
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,340
I don't know, I'm sorry.

1094
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,300
I'm just fucking...

1095
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,260
There's something wrong with me.

1096
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:29,780
All my...

1097
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,320
I closed my eyes and all I think about is Marvel Rivals stuff now.

1098
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,020
That's all I think about trying to...

1099
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,980
No, where is...

1100
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,120
Oh yeah, like this meme.

1101
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,320
Guys, I'm gonna send you guys Marvel Rivals meme now.

1102
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,780
This is...

1103
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,380
I'm like, I relate to that.

1104
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,620
Oh wait, I know...

1105
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,120
I understand that reference.

1106
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,000
I'll be like, I know that reference.

1107
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,380
So true.

1108
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,900
I really like that meme.

1109
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,540
I'm too far gone.

1110
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,320
No, I am.

1111
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,460
I'm way too far gone right now.

1112
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:16,900
Like...

1113
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:20,340
Like, there's no saving.

1114
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,480
Oh my...

1115
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,920
What is this positioning?

1116
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,400
Like, where's my...

1117
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,940
Why is my stream there?

1118
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,880
I'm so confused.

1119
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,780
I mean, okay.

1120
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,400
I mean, okay.

1121
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:36,920
Hi.

1122
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,820
Are you having fun?

1123
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:39,750
Are you...

1124
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,210
Did you...

1125
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,700
Did you have fun?

1126
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,440
I didn't even...

1127
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,480
I hope...

1128
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,300
Bro, okay.

1129
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:52,680
You got that, Luna.

1130
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,260
You got that.

1131
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,360
Wait, who?

1132
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,760
Oh my god.

1133
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,620
Okay.

1134
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,260
Like, what do you mean I got that?

1135
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,320
I'm not gonna push up.

1136
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,120
Okay, goodbye.

1137
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,070
Okay, we're gonna...

1138
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,160
Also, when I stream, I like, I'm...

1139
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,680
I think...

1140
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,100
Oh no.

1141
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,280
Oh no.

1142
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,760
Like, you look at me and I look at you.

1143
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,140
When I stream, my hands shake more, too.

1144
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,040
Because I'm more nervous.

1145
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,080
Because you guys are like, watching me.

1146
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,620
Because you guys watch me and then my hands start shaking.

1147
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,900
Because you're like, you're like, observing.

1148
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,000
You know?

1149
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,740
You're like, observing.

1150
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,260
And you're like, trying...

1151
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,680
I'm being observed.

1152
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:57,000
So, my hands shake more because...

1153
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,180
Bro, what the f...

1154
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:58,700
Bro, okay.

1155
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,640
I'll kill him myself.

1156
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,660
But like, what the fuck?

1157
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Bro, I'll kill him, too.

1158
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,000
I'll fucking kill him, too.

1159
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,240
Alright.

1160
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,760
Oh, okay.

1161
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,280
Our Mantis also got involved.

1162
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,080
That's every stream.

1163
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,200
I have like...

1164
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,160
This is high elo.

1165
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,380
It's different.

1166
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,760
I haven't streamed high elo rank in a long time, too.

1167
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,600
I haven't streamed GM rank before.

1168
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,480
So, I get like, more nervous.

1169
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,380
That's why I'm like, missing more.

1170
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,540
Don't worry!

1171
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,820
Oh, okay.

1172
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,740
We don't need to worry, apparently.

1173
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,140
We definitely don't need to worry.

1174
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,460
Alright, they're born again.

1175
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:48,220
Oh.

1176
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,000
Okay, guys.

1177
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,080
I'm fucking rolling out.

1178
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,500
Did you have fun, Psylocke?

1179
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,140
Did you have fun?

1180
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,180
Oh my god.

1181
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,120
There we go.

1182
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:04,880
Yay!

1183
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,160
We did it!

1184
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,440
What the fuck?

1185
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,680
You have no fu...

1186
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,320
Oh my god!

1187
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,300
Holy shit!

1188
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:29,900
Technically, we are all playing Rivals on Christmas.

1189
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,760
Oh my god.

1190
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,700
Oh my god, that's crazy.

1191
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,660
Travis put him on the naughty list.

1192
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,080
Holy fuck!

1193
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,320
On Christmas.

1194
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,680
You have no family.

1195
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,760
Oh my god.

1196
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,380
That's actually insane.

1197
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,700
Straight to the naughty list, bro.

1198
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,120
On fucking Christmas?

1199
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,640
That's actually...

1200
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,460
Oh my god.

1201
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:13,580
Bro!

1202
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,440
What happened on Christmas?

1203
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,620
Is he for you?

1204
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,120
We're all messed up.

1205
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,760
Well, we all saw it, too.

1206
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,750
We all saw it.

1207
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,160
Travis twisted his balls.

1208
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,340
Technically, I can report him.

1209
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,400
Wait, does Xyphel got to GM3?

1210
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,300
He was top 500, like...

1211
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,560
Yesterday!

1212
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,220
Oh no, is he too...

1213
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,960
I think he's doom queuing.

1214
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,740
And he was...

1215
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,260
He was Eternity yesterday.

1216
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,540
Oh my god.

1217
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,900
Oh my god, he has to...

1218
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:00,880
Oh my god.

1219
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,640
This guy has to be doom queuing.

1220
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,780
There's no way.

1221
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,180
He was literally Eternity.

1222
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,060
He was Eternity yesterday.

1223
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,260
He's 24 out.

1224
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,640
Bro, he's been streaming.

1225
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,380
Oh my god, he's been streaming Rivals for 24 hours.

1226
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,460
Holy fuck, okay.

1227
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:24,940
Oh my god.

1228
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,080
Don't ban Hawkeye for us.

1229
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,140
Oh my god.

1230
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,560
Shield tanks, we should get rid of them.

1231
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,500
Holy fuck.

1232
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:34,660
Oh my god.

1233
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,220
He's in Duty.

1234
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,960
You guys think I have a problem.

1235
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,700
At least I stop after 10 hours.

1236
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,040
Oh my god, he's literally at the 23rd hour mark.

1237
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,220
Shit, okay.

1238
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,560
Oh my god.

1239
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,440
There are bigger fish in the sea.

1240
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,820
Now, now I think you're normal.

1241
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:02,440
Yeah, I played 10 to 15 hours but not...

1242
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,380
But that was off stream.

1243
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,780
I could never stream 24 hours.

1244
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:12,420
Bro, I literally saw him in GM 1 this morning.

1245
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,620
I saw him in GM 1 the second morning.

1246
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,280
Also, TsunamiCat, thank you for the raid.

1247
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,420
I really appreciate it.

1248
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,640
Thank you, thank you.

1249
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,440
Brother, it's Christmas.

1250
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:26,700
It doesn't happen.

1251
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,260
Oh my god.

1252
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,860
Happy Merry Christmas, everybody.

1253
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,880
Merry Christmas.

1254
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,500
So, hello everybody from Tsunami's cat raid.

1255
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,820
My name is DokiBird.

1256
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,620
I usually stream on YouTube.

1257
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,880
But today I'm on Twitch.

1258
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,840
Because I want to stream Marvel Rivals rink right now.

1259
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,800
And I usually...

1260
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,800
And it's like a guerrilla stream.

1261
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,160
So that's where I do my guerrilla stuff.

1262
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,500
So like, this is what I do.

1263
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,440
I don't climb up the stairs.

1264
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,400
And I won't do it like quick.

1265
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,060
I just do this.

1266
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,700
I don't think he knows you can't jump there unless you're...

1267
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,680
I don't think he knows you can't jump there unless you're Luna.

1268
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,340
This is quicker than using the stairs.

1269
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,000
And I don't have to...

1270
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,860
I don't have to like travel up.

1271
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,180
Travel behind for it.

1272
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:15,560
I don't think he knew that you can't climb that unless you're like...

1273
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,340
Unless you're literally on Luna.

1274
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:24,920
Okay.

1275
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,820
Okay, I'm gonna put my thing on...

1276
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,400
I need to put it on the Venom.

1277
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,200
If the Venom's gonna dive like that.

1278
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,800
There, I froze him.

1279
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,940
Oh my god, bro.

1280
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,460
This team is way too split for me to do anything right now.

1281
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,900
Okay, look at me.

1282
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:51,460
No!

1283
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,520
No, Mantis!

1284
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,700
Okay, that's bad.

1285
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:01,540
Does he have...

1286
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,020
No, please.

1287
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,020
Oh my god, please.

1288
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:08,660
Do not hit him!

1289
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,600
Do not hit him!

1290
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,300
Why did you hit him?!

1291
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,500
If he didn't hit him, I'll be okay.

1292
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,160
Oh, thank god I lived.

1293
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:19,820
No, Venom!

1294
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,680
Okay, Venom.

1295
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,420
Okay, Venom.

1296
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,660
Venom!

1297
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,160
Venom!

1298
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,600
Okay.

1299
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,560
That's...

1300
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,820
That's fine.

1301
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,860
That's fine.

1302
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,580
I'm gonna use...

1303
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,460
That's so fine.

1304
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:44,920
Okay.

1305
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:46,640
Don't...

1306
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,020
Oh my god, how many times do I have to freeze this guy, honestly?

1307
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,500
Wait, okay.

1308
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,080
I'm just gonna leave.

1309
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:54,780
That's fine.

1310
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:56,580
That's...

1311
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,500
That's so fine.

1312
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,120
I'm alive.

1313
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:01,500
Venom!

1314
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,360
Luna's my favorite, but like, I can play any support.

1315
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,340
It's just Luna's way too good.

1316
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,540
And I trust myself on...

1317
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,360
I trust to make an impact on...

1318
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,800
Well, I trust on every support I can make an impact, but...

1319
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,380
Literally, like...

1320
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,080
Like, look at my team right now.

1321
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,600
They're not...

1322
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,700
They're not feeling...

1323
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,640
I don't think they're feeling it right now.

1324
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:29,800
Okay.

1325
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,100
Okay.

1326
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,460
We can kill him, right?

1327
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,740
Oh, hey guys!

1328
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,520
Hey, guys!

1329
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,260
All right.

1330
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,080
Hey, everybody!

1331
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,660
I hope we have...

1332
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,340
We have Mantis ult for...

1333
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,700
Psylocke ult, but like, okay.

1334
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,380
That's fine.

1335
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:47,860
I...

1336
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,880
I was really worried about this team.

1337
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,060
Not gonna lie.

1338
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,420
Like...

1339
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:54,200
This...

1340
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,660
This team...

1341
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:00,020
Was not giving me any inspiration.

1342
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,480
Shit.

1343
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,820
Get shit on, I guess.

1344
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,180
I don't know what the fuck to get shit on.

1345
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,160
All right.

1346
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,100
Okay, I need to be on the Venom.

1347
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,400
All right.

1348
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,420
Oh my god.

1349
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:26,180
Venom, please.

1350
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,500
Venom, please.

1351
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,000
Venom.

1352
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,320
Venom!

1353
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,160
Captain America!

1354
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,040
Captain America as well!

1355
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,160
Please!

1356
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,040
They have Psylocke ult.

1357
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,720
Psylocke.

1358
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,440
Oh my god, he's alive!

1359
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,520
Holy shit, he's alive!

1360
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,480
So proud!

1361
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,240
Poor Venom.

1362
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,480
Venom!

1363
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,900
You're swinging so bad!

1364
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,480
Where are you?!

1365
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,520
My sensitivity's not...

1366
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,260
It's not high enough for this!

1367
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,400
I fucking feel like I have ADHD!

1368
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,500
Okay, here we go.

1369
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,180
All right.

1370
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,280
It's fine.

1371
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,200
We're so fine.

1372
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,440
I don't!

1373
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,040
I actually don't have ADHD!

1374
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:20,420
But like...

1375
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:23,460
This Venom moves like he has like...

1376
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,600
He's fucking riddled with ADHD right now, or Adderall.

1377
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,920
Like, the way he's fucking moving.

1378
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,960
Holy fuck.

1379
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,080
Please, we can definitely kill Venom!

1380
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,980
Oh my god, he is hyped up in so much fucking Adderall.

1381
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:47,860
Jesus.

1382
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,780
Oh, this is bad.

1383
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,040
Oh!

1384
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,680
I'm ready to...

1385
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,100
Dance!

1386
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,440
Oh my god, we gotta run!

1387
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,580
Guys, we gotta fucking...

1388
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:03,820
All right, we're all full HP.

1389
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:04,580
Captain, please!

1390
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:05,580
Captain!

1391
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,740
I'm running!

1392
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,680
I'm running!

1393
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,880
We have zero shields!

1394
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,980
I'm fucking goodbye design for...

1395
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,140
Goodbye.

1396
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,760
You are not living.

1397
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,560
There we go.

1398
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,840
I swear...

1399
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,640
I swear!

1400
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:23,540
God!

1401
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,280
Holy shit!

1402
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:25,740
Okay.

1403
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,260
That's fine.

1404
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,920
Oh my god, please!

1405
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:30,780
He came back!

1406
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,940
Oh my fucking god!

1407
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,960
Oh, he came back!

1408
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,060
That's so fucked!

1409
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,360
That's actually so...

1410
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,020
Oh my god!

1411
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,720
Why did you come back?!

1412
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,280
Why did you come back?!

1413
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,200
Bro!

1414
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,180
You guys!

1415
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,760
I don't wanna deal with this!

1416
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:58,600
Okay.

1417
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,060
All right, Venom.

1418
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:01,260
Venom has the thing.

1419
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,340
He has again.

1420
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,460
He fucking 100% has it.

1421
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,980
Oh my god, please.

1422
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:10,840
That's good.

1423
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,340
That's good.

1424
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,340
But they have again after.

1425
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,100
I can feel it.

1426
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,140
Oh my god, design for...

1427
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,280
We're gonna make it.

1428
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,920
We're so...

1429
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,200
We're so...

1430
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,880
I wanna use my fucking frozen freeze.

1431
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,860
Please, just burn him.

1432
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,660
He's so low.

1433
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:32,860
Oh my god!

1434
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,040
You're still alive?!

1435
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:37,540
Yay!

1436
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,500
He really...

1437
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,220
I don't know I'm alive!

1438
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,660
I don't know!

1439
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,080
I don't know why he came back!

1440
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:51,820
Oh my god.

1441
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,020
Wait, that's 0 deaths?

1442
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,000
I don't fucking...

1443
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,760
How?!

1444
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,740
How the fuck that's 0 deaths?!

1445
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:57,720
Oh my god!

1446
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,540
I feel like I've been jumping...

1447
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,640
Jumping around every time!

1448
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,040
Bro, how?

1449
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,520
Literally every time that Venom dies me, I just...

1450
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,880
Freeze him.

1451
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,680
And then I run away.

1452
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,820
Because I'm like, I'm not winning that fight.

1453
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:17,920
I literally freeze him and I'm like, bye.

1454
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,500
Oh my god.

1455
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,720
I was just like, bro, fuck you, come on.

1456
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,120
I'm not dealing with that.

1457
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,520
That's why I was like, why did he come back?

1458
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,180
Why the fuck did he come back for me?

1459
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,060
He was 1 HP, I was 1 HP.

1460
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:41,400
And then, like, right as we hit main, dive and I'll try to save a bubble for you.

1461
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:43,780
Venom!

1462
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,840
I don't even know where that came from.

1463
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:50,360
I just know everybody keeps making that 19 inches of Venom joke.

1464
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,380
I've never watched the Venom movies.

1465
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,580
You keep literally saving the Xynos mental.

1466
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,040
What if I avoid him?

1467
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,680
I know, but it's not gonna work.

1468
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,380
He's at the 20!

1469
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,980
Guys, he's at the 24 hour mark.

1470
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:12,480
He is not, like, he is not okay at the moment.

1471
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,560
There's a higher percentage that he's crashing out.

1472
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:24,860
He's literally at 24 hours of marble arrivals.

1473
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,680
That is not...

1474
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:26,880
He was...

1475
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,340
The fact that he was eternity in the fucking morning.

1476
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:35,280
Not morning, like, yesterday is what's, like, concerning.

1477
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,340
That's what I'm concerned about.

1478
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,100
I'm sure he's fine.

1479
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,420
All right.

1480
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,460
Let's see, Trudas?

1481
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,520
Seriously?

1482
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,460
I thought I had a problem.

1483
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,660
That's why I'm like, maybe I should...

1484
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:07,700
Like, the Xypho's an amazing player, but, like...

1485
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:16,420
If in the morning I saw him at eternity and now he's in the GM3, that does not make me feel confident.

1486
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,140
I am a passenger princess.

1487
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:30,600
Yeah, that's like when I was playing, like, 12 hours...

1488
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,370
Like, 11 hours of...

1489
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,840
11 hours of rank and I was not okay.

1490
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,900
His 24 hours is my 11 hour mark on stream.

1491
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:44,480
And I was 100...

1492
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,740
I was not okay, guys.

1493
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,660
I was absolutely...

1494
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,780
Like, I was losing a lot.

1495
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,600
My first, like, miss on the freeze.

1496
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,060
Yay!

1497
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,510
Make way for the princess.

1498
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,220
That has been a really bad loss for me.

1499
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,020
Honestly.

1500
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,520
Yay!

1501
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,540
I mean...

1502
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,520
Plus 17?

1503
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,440
I don't understand how...

1504
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,820
I don't understand how the...

1505
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,460
The point system works.

1506
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:31,680
I feel like I should've got 20...

1507
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,560
Plus 20 for that.

1508
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,540
Remove his whimsy.

1509
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,080
Oh, shit.

1510
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,540
That was an instant kill.

1511
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:43,460
Okay.

1512
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,800
That was so fast.

1513
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,380
Wait, no, I won.

1514
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,400
I won't be that fast.

1515
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:50,800
Nacho, thank you for the 100 bits.

1516
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,520
Thank you, thank you.

1517
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,020
Ecom, thank you for tier 1 sub.

1518
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,020
Thank you, thank you.

1519
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,860
I really appreciate it.

1520
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,700
It doesn't make sense.

1521
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:58,240
I don't know.

1522
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,600
Yeah, no, he's been playing for...

1523
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,880
That's why I was, like, surprised.

1524
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:04,220
I was like, whoa.

1525
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,220
That's why I'm...

1526
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:09,460
I'm just like, whoa.

1527
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,060
Like, how the fuck...

1528
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,020
How the fuck was he in that deep?

1529
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:22,680
Alright.

1530
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,140
Alright, here we go.

1531
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:28,980
On Christmas...

1532
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,680
Well, for me, I just don't celebrate the holidays.

1533
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:31,780
That's why I'm fucking playing.

1534
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,140
Like, that doesn't matter for me.

1535
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,700
1, 2, 3, thank you for...

1536
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,660
1, 2, 3, and Revi, thank you for tier 1 sub.

1537
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,560
Thank you, thank you.

1538
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:40,900
I really appreciate it.

1539
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,840
Oh my god, is that the real Doki?

1540
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,080
Did they say that?

1541
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:44,940
No, okay.

1542
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,360
There's a lot of Dragoons in GM.

1543
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,620
I was very surprised.

1544
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,260
I was incre...

1545
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,040
Like, I was...

1546
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:52,720
I'm sorry.

1547
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,740
I don't mean to...

1548
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,080
I'm sorry, that sounded so fucking condescending.

1549
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,000
But, like, I'm just...

1550
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,800
Guys, I was so surprised because I was like, you guys watch me?

1551
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:07,180
Even, like, I was like, whoa, you guys watch me?

1552
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,080
Oh my god.

1553
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:13,000
It just makes me so happy that, like, gamers, like, watch me.

1554
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:13,660
You know?

1555
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:17,800
Like, a lot of, like, GM players were like, oh my god, I'm a huge fan, Doki.

1556
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:28,600
So, like, usually, you know, I'm just surprised that, like, high-ranking gamers actually, like, like to watch me even though I do, like, the dumbest shit.

1557
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,900
So, it just makes me really happy.

1558
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:37,920
Like, you guys are really good at video games and you like watching me too.

1559
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:42,560
Travis Gracef, rawr.

1560
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,560
No, I'm just...

1561
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:50,000
I'm just really happy, guys, that high-heeled gamers are, like, fans of me.

1562
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:53,140
I bumped into so many, like, GM Dragoon players.

1563
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,880
I bumped into a top, like, a top...

1564
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:02,860
This guy that peaked top five and then he added me and was like, oh my god, I'm a fan.

1565
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,640
He's like, do you remember Niko from four years ago?

1566
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,800
Like, he's my best pro.

1567
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,840
Like, oh my god, have you ever won a duo or anything?

1568
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,240
And I'm like, what the fuck?

1569
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,640
Like, that's crazy.

1570
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:20,300
Yeah, yeah, this guy peaked top five in my rivals and he, like, we got him against...

1571
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:24,940
In a team game against him and he was like, oh my god, like, I'm actually...

1572
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,640
Oh my god, I'm fucking...

1573
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,100
Guys, that was a terrible portal.

1574
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,060
Oh my god, thank you for the 10 subs.

1575
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:37,040
Thank you, thank you.

1576
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,040
Guys, I don't think...

1577
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,680
Guys, I'm gonna...

1578
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:40,780
There.

1579
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,360
I don't want to be in that portal again.

1580
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:52,980
And they're like, oh yeah, if you ever need a DPS, like, duo or, like, player in your stack, like, invite me.

1581
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,880
And I was like, bro, you peaked top five.

1582
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,160
Like...

1583
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:02,900
Bro, I'm just a fucking VTuber that's just playing this as a fucking hobby.

1584
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:06,040
Because I'm so down bad for Marvel Rivals.

1585
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,660
Oh god.

1586
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,300
Oh my god.

1587
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,860
Oh my god.

1588
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,920
Jesus Christ.

1589
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:21,940
I'm fucking leaving.

1590
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,740
Okay, goodbye.

1591
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,480
Goodbye.

1592
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:29,540
You had to die for that.

1593
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,340
All right, I'm sorry, Rocket.

1594
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:34,320
I did my best.

1595
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,610
Yeah, but like, you know, this is like...

1596
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,000
I do other stuff too.

1597
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,420
Like, I can't...

1598
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,040
I don't come...

1599
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,860
I can't commit my...

1600
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,080
Guys, I don't think this is a win.

1601
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:45,550
This looks...

1602
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,480
This looks...

1603
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,540
This does not look great.

1604
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,680
I need to cross.

1605
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:56,480
I need to cross the road and look at both sides.

1606
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,000
I'm just gonna do simple geometry here.

1607
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,520
Guys, where the fuck are we going?

1608
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,500
Oh, I thought I had this.

1609
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,380
Okay.

1610
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,220
Guys, I...

1611
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,160
I don't know.

1612
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,980
I'll do this to save us.

1613
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,860
All right, how the fuck did Dom from stat in this?

1614
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,100
Guys, this team is not it.

1615
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,460
100%.

1616
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,960
This is actually not it.

1617
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,020
Where are we...

1618
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,460
Where are we going?

1619
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,080
Like, what?

1620
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,900
Oh wait, we got kills.

1621
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:41,600
Nice.

1622
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,720
Hey, we got two kills.

1623
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,360
Nice.

1624
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,460
Guys, I...

1625
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,060
Guys.

1626
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:51,720
Guys.

1627
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,540
Guys, this is...

1628
01:20:58,540 --> 01:20:59,220
Whoa.

1629
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,780
I don't think this game...

1630
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:05,040
This team is a little special.

1631
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,780
Not gonna lie.

1632
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:10,200
This is a very special team.

1633
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:15,500
This is definitely a very special team right here.

1634
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,420
Oh my god.

1635
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,980
Like, what do I do?

1636
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,700
I can't do anything because I'm supporting.

1637
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,100
Yippee!

1638
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:26,580
Whoa!

1639
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,880
All I can do is just...

1640
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,620
Oh, this is where I die.

1641
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:35,940
Yeah, I think...

1642
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,480
Yeah, we have one fight.

1643
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:39,480
No, I don't even think...

1644
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,060
I don't even...

1645
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,560
I don't even think we would win...

1646
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,180
Like, win the defense round if we make it.

1647
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:51,390
All right.

1648
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:53,770
This is fine.

1649
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,390
This is so fine.

1650
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:58,400
This is...

1651
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:00,430
Guys, we gotta...

1652
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:02,570
We gotta go, girl.

1653
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,370
We gotta go.

1654
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,050
All right, I'm on it.

1655
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:10,370
I'm on it.

1656
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:11,910
Whoa!

1657
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:14,410
Whoa!

1658
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:16,470
Okay, stand!

1659
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:16,930
Stand!

1660
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:18,690
Literally, stand on my arm!

1661
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:23,590
Okay.

1662
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:24,770
All right.

1663
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,050
He flew up.

1664
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:29,110
Like...

1665
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:32,530
Like, what's the point?

1666
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:37,030
What's the point of flying up?

1667
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:40,930
Like, he flew up!

1668
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:43,210
Like, why did you fly?

1669
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:45,610
I had ult right here!

1670
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:48,150
Okay.

1671
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:49,570
This is our...

1672
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:52,190
This is the only reason why I hate playing Cloak and Dagger.

1673
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:52,950
They don't know...

1674
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,650
They don't know how Cloak and Dagger works.

1675
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:58,750
Well, it works and we're like literally in GM Diamond queues.

1676
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:01,930
Like, how do you not know how Cloak and Dagger well works?

1677
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:06,230
You actually have to scream at your team and be like, Stand on it!

1678
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:07,610
There's blue on the floor.

1679
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:09,210
There's blue glue.

1680
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:11,530
Just stand.

1681
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:14,110
Stand on it.

1682
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:16,590
It's not that hard.

1683
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:20,390
It's apparently very hard, apparently.

1684
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:27,850
I'm not gonna look at this.

1685
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:29,290
Did he get anything?

1686
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,690
Apparently, like...

1687
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:36,010
He's one.

1688
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:36,850
He's so low.

1689
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:37,790
Please.

1690
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:40,450
Please.

1691
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:41,850
He's so...

1692
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:42,630
Oh my god.

1693
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,370
Oh my...

1694
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:46,250
It's not worth it.

1695
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:48,010
I don't think this fight is worth it.

1696
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,630
Yeah, I'm just gonna die to this fight.

1697
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:57,250
It was not worth it.

1698
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:02,290
Alright.

1699
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:03,910
Uh oh, next fight.

1700
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:04,670
I waited.

1701
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:06,510
I knew that was an unwinnable fight.

1702
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:07,870
So that's why I waited.

1703
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:09,310
So sick.

1704
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,290
Oh my gosh, I've been...

1705
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,210
Well, it's like...

1706
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:13,190
I'm not sick.

1707
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:15,230
It's just my cough comes and goes.

1708
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,630
But it's not as bad now.

1709
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:19,030
I'm a...

1710
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:20,510
It's a little better because I haven't...

1711
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:21,290
On a break.

1712
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:22,170
So like...

1713
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:22,770
Okay, guys.

1714
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:23,830
You think they're gonna stand on my glue?

1715
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:25,090
Let's find out.

1716
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:28,250
Alright.

1717
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:30,370
Alright.

1718
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:31,850
Oh my god!

1719
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:32,310
They're standing!

1720
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,770
We didn't need that rocky raccoon ult!

1721
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:34,410
But that's okay.

1722
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:35,370
I'm not gonna judge.

1723
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:38,590
There was a guy right here.

1724
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,110
Is he gone now?

1725
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:47,290
He was gone now.

1726
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:47,590
Okay.

1727
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,130
I thought there was a guy right here.

1728
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:50,850
Alright, simple geometry.

1729
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:53,150
You see like the...

1730
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:54,030
Heals bounce off.

1731
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,010
So I can literally do that and it heals them.

1732
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:57,690
Okay!

1733
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:58,570
Okay!

1734
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,370
Oh, okay!

1735
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:03,510
Holy shit!

1736
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:04,170
That pop!

1737
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:04,790
Oh my god!

1738
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:06,310
He jumped into the ult!

1739
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:06,990
That's crazy!

1740
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,710
That's actually so smart!

1741
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,430
Holy fuck!

1742
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:11,030
Oh my god!

1743
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:12,770
That's like crazy!

1744
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:17,470
Oh my god!

1745
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:19,130
He literally jumped into hell!

1746
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:25,290
That was a really smart play, not gonna lie.

1747
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,490
I'm gonna suck.

1748
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:27,210
I'm gonna suck.

1749
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,210
Oh, sorry!

1750
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:29,630
I'll heal.

1751
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:30,610
I'm gonna heal.

1752
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:31,570
I'm gonna be a support player.

1753
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:35,930
I'm gonna be a support player, guys.

1754
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:37,170
Oh my god!

1755
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:38,070
I'm actually...

1756
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:39,570
Nope!

1757
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:40,410
Nope!

1758
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:41,130
JK!

1759
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:41,770
Goodbye!

1760
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:43,110
Goodbye!

1761
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,510
Guys, turn around!

1762
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:48,070
Turn around!

1763
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,550
There's a security screen!

1764
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:50,950
There's a fucking surgeon!

1765
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,350
All right.

1766
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:57,250
There's a surgeon behind us.

1767
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:59,210
We should have broke his hands when we could.

1768
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:04,050
Damn, dude.

1769
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:06,130
He has a fucking wild vision stick.

1770
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:11,170
We shouldn't have let him.

1771
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:15,390
I am a surgeon!

1772
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:19,110
Yeah, we should have kept his hands broken.

1773
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:23,950
All right, this is technically last fight, so...

1774
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:27,610
Guys, this is scary.

1775
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:31,170
Oh my god!

1776
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:32,370
Oh my god!

1777
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:33,350
My ult's gone!

1778
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:35,430
There's too much damage!

1779
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:43,410
You know, we made it pretty far for like, where we had to do.

1780
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:47,610
Like, where we came from, that's pretty good.

1781
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:50,410
We went through a lot.

1782
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:59,330
Yeah, pretty far for what it was, chat.

1783
01:26:59,530 --> 01:26:59,940
That is...

1784
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:02,390
That was pretty far.

1785
01:27:04,830 --> 01:27:05,550
Maybe it's...

1786
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,230
Bro, I've only been grinding at these hours.

1787
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:09,780
I've only...

1788
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:14,710
I've only been playing my pro rivals at these hours.

1789
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:18,190
I have not been playing at like, actual hours.

1790
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:23,330
That's the thing.

1791
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:27,430
I try to play decent hours, but it's the same quality of game.

1792
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:29,090
So I was like, this doesn't matter.

1793
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:33,110
Except at this time, I have people to play with, like...

1794
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:44,350
I'm like, I'm the duo partner that people call up on when there's like, nobody else online, bro.

1795
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:47,610
Because I'm a support player.

1796
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:49,770
They're like, why would you ever...

1797
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:56,510
They're like, no, none of the actual gamers are online at this time.

1798
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:01,490
I know my place.

1799
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:03,490
I'm the last...

1800
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:05,130
I know my place, chat.

1801
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:09,230
I'm not even plan B.

1802
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,470
I'm like, plan Z.

1803
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:17,210
Guys, no, I've accepted it.

1804
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,250
I've known my place.

1805
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:19,130
That's why I'm at...

1806
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:22,890
I'm playing Marvel Rivals at this hour.

1807
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:28,190
Hi, that's so cake.

1808
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:29,490
I've accepted it.

1809
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,150
This is why I play at these hours.

1810
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:36,750
So I didn't...

1811
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,330
Exactly.

1812
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:40,010
It's like, this or solo queue, chat.

1813
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:43,010
Like, of course I'll take this.

1814
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,650
Hey, Rocket.

1815
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:51,310
I'm gonna stay on the ground.

1816
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:52,470
Rocket can't pick me.

1817
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,770
I'm gonna stay up here.

1818
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:58,650
I feel safer up here.

1819
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,310
Jesus Christ, okay.

1820
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:06,910
It'll be fine.

1821
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,070
Penny, please!

1822
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:11,110
Penny!

1823
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,930
Oh my god!

1824
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:14,330
Penny!

1825
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:14,670
Penny!

1826
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,430
Penny, please!

1827
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,690
Oh my god!

1828
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:25,010
Oh my god!

1829
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:36,910
I can't outlive her!

1830
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:37,670
Fuck you, punish her!

1831
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:41,650
Why did no one push up?

1832
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:43,370
I don't understand.

1833
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:45,490
We have the same support line.

1834
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:47,730
Penny, please!

1835
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:54,990
Oh my god.

1836
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:56,990
Guys, it's okay.

1837
01:29:58,430 --> 01:29:59,710
It's okay.

1838
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:03,110
Bro, Penny is really good at this map.

1839
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:03,750
It's just...

1840
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:05,270
I can't heal.

1841
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,170
I can't.

1842
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:08,410
I don't have enough heal output for this.

1843
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:11,630
What the fuck?

1844
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,010
Jesus Christ.

1845
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:15,870
Oh my god, bro.

1846
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:16,590
He's just gonna...

1847
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:20,030
I'm just...

1848
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:20,790
I'm fucking...

1849
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:21,510
Oh, Christ.

1850
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:25,230
Again!

1851
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:26,990
Again!

1852
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:29,190
Oh, that's...

1853
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:30,710
Guys, that's two ults.

1854
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,130
It's fine.

1855
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:32,790
I just didn't think we need the Penny ult.

1856
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:33,490
That's for sure.

1857
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:40,220
All right, I'll take the high ground here.

1858
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:42,580
Oh my god!

1859
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:45,220
I didn't fucking wait for one second because I wanted high ground!

1860
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,300
It's fine.

1861
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:52,500
He has his eye.

1862
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,420
He has eye right here.

1863
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,380
No!

1864
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:02,520
Oh!

1865
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,260
Okay!

1866
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:08,400
There we go!

1867
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,320
Okay, bro!

1868
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,080
There you go!

1869
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,080
Oh my god!

1870
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:12,980
You're so alive!

1871
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:13,800
You're so healthy!

1872
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:15,680
Oh my god!

1873
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,020
You have life insurance!

1874
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,560
All right, there we go.

1875
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:21,180
We're fine.

1876
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,820
We're so healthy.

1877
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:27,500
I don't think we need ults for this for now.

1878
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,760
I'll do it later.

1879
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,420
I'll do it later.

1880
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:33,260
Okay, now.

1881
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,700
You're so healthy.

1882
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,260
You're so healthy!

1883
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:39,480
Oh my god!

1884
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,460
I'm a fucking gamer!

1885
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:43,380
Okay!

1886
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,620
All right, let's go.

1887
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:46,260
You know what?

1888
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:47,000
Fuck it.

1889
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:47,640
Let's go.

1890
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,260
That's right.

1891
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,920
I'm fucking gaming.

1892
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,420
That was coming at me.

1893
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,360
That's right.

1894
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:55,040
FPS.

1895
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:56,140
Okay!

1896
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,380
Yeah, I don't think...

1897
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,300
Yeah, let's...

1898
01:31:59,300 --> 01:31:59,780
I'm leaving.

1899
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:07,170
All right, that's fine.

1900
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:09,750
That's fine.

1901
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:11,210
We can...

1902
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:12,310
I'll give you the reset.

1903
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:15,210
I did that for his reset.

1904
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:17,110
Oh, did he not get...

1905
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,930
Did he not hit him?

1906
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:19,610
Oh, he didn't hit him!

1907
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:21,370
I was gonna say, where the fuck is your reset?

1908
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:24,090
You should have got a reset there.

1909
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:24,730
Bye!

1910
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:26,350
Bye!

1911
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:28,830
Goodbye!

1912
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:30,410
I'm sorry!

1913
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:33,810
Yeah, that's the sacrifice I have to make.

1914
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:35,490
Did I get far?

1915
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:37,830
Oh, goodbye, Penny!

1916
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:40,810
You're so fucking staggered.

1917
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:42,970
There's no way I'm leaving.

1918
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:44,230
Goodbye.

1919
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:45,310
I'll patch you up.

1920
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:46,470
I'll get you next time.

1921
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:46,810
Goodbye.

1922
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:47,830
You better stop that evil!

1923
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:48,550
Ew!

1924
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:52,490
Bro, there's nothing I can do.

1925
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:53,790
Like, what do you want me to do?

1926
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:55,730
I'm just a little guy.

1927
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:58,130
I'm literally just a little guy.

1928
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:03,310
I think I improved a lot, though.

1929
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:08,330
He's not looking at me.

1930
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:09,850
Oh, thank god!

1931
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:10,890
Okay!

1932
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:12,730
We lost two, though.

1933
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:15,110
That's okay.

1934
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:17,050
No!

1935
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:18,370
Oh, god.

1936
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:19,370
Oh, god.

1937
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,350
Oh, my...

1938
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,690
No!

1939
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:24,090
I had one percent!

1940
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:27,310
I did the...

1941
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,850
Okay, it wouldn't matter if I lived.

1942
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:30,390
We were all dead, anyway.

1943
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:32,850
It didn't matter, chat.

1944
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:35,650
We were all dead during that part.

1945
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:37,890
I tried.

1946
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:38,650
I did.

1947
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:41,030
Gsharko, thank you for the thousand bitties!

1948
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:41,830
Thank you, thank you!

1949
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:43,970
Will we see Marble Rivals pros where you do?

1950
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:44,910
Can you mention the future?

1951
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:47,910
No, I don't think Marble Rivals pros know who I am.

1952
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:51,570
I'm just...

1953
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:52,990
I'm just a little guy.

1954
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:53,990
I'm not that...

1955
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:54,630
I'm, like...

1956
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:55,530
Oh, wow!

1957
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:56,230
Please!

1958
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:57,730
Ah, please!

1959
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:59,490
Ah!

1960
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:00,390
Oh, my god!

1961
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:01,510
It's actually huge!

1962
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:04,190
Please!

1963
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,210
It's actually huge!

1964
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:10,730
Bro, where is he?

1965
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:11,890
Where is he?

1966
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:13,690
Holy shit!

1967
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:15,850
Oh, my god!

1968
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:19,170
That was the biggest ult of his fucking life.

1969
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:22,050
And I was the only one that could secure it for him.

1970
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:27,290
Jesus Christ, that was a huge ult for him.

1971
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:29,670
We have...

1972
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:33,150
We have to hold this for two minutes!

1973
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,350
Yeah, I...

1974
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:35,830
Yeah.

1975
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:37,450
Yeah.

1976
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:39,650
Yeah!

1977
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:48,510
Oh, I'm trying my best to keep you alive, Rocket.

1978
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:50,050
Hahaha!

1979
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:51,830
There we go!

1980
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:53,010
There we go!

1981
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:56,850
Please, give me, like, a little poke.

1982
01:34:57,790 --> 01:34:58,670
Give me...

1983
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,770
Give me a little...

1984
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:01,390
Literally one fight and that's it.

1985
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:03,110
We have, like, one fight to live.

1986
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:06,110
I'm playing out of my mind right now.

1987
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:12,950
I'm, like, sort of locked in, but sort of not.

1988
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:17,110
Like, because I'm...

1989
01:35:17,110 --> 01:35:18,510
I'm never locked in when I'm streaming.

1990
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:19,450
I'm just gonna let you guys...

1991
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:21,930
I'm gonna be brutally honest with you guys.

1992
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:28,170
I'm gonna be so truthful right now.

1993
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:30,020
If I'm online, it's not...

1994
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:32,990
Oh my god.

1995
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:34,850
This is bad.

1996
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:38,730
Please, play on this.

1997
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:39,110
Please.

1998
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:40,270
This is literally it.

1999
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:41,130
Please.

2000
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:43,410
Please.

2001
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:44,910
Play...

2002
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:45,690
Play on my ult.

2003
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:46,590
Please.

2004
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:50,430
Oh my god.

2005
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:54,610
Oh my god, the reload.

2006
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:57,470
I gotta reload.

2007
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:04,300
Can...

2008
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,320
Maybe kill him?

2009
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:06,440
Okay.

2010
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,220
Oh no.

2011
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,180
Oh no.

2012
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:14,420
Oh no!

2013
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:19,140
No!

2014
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,220
No!

2015
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:20,940
There was nothing!

2016
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,260
There was nothing!

2017
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,080
I was so low!

2018
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,880
I was so low already.

2019
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:31,320
Oh my god.

2020
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:32,920
I'm fucking heading over.

2021
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,420
I'm heading over.

2022
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,280
We have again!

2023
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:37,220
No!

2024
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,260
We didn't touch!

2025
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,980
We didn't touch!

2026
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,180
Oh my god.

2027
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:45,140
I was so...

2028
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:47,180
I was playing such a good game too.

2029
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,700
Oh my god.

2030
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:52,740
I was actually playing an insane game.

2031
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:54,400
Holy shit.

2032
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:58,540
That game was actually insane.

2033
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,940
My team didn't touch.

2034
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:02,320
Fucking feels bad.

2035
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,480
Yeah, I played really well.

2036
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:08,800
I think I played really well there.

2037
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:12,280
Minus 25!

2038
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,120
I got lost more than I came.

2039
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,280
Oh my god.

2040
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,620
Oh my god.

2041
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,360
Wait, I think Mac is ready.

2042
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:22,240
All right, let's see.

2043
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:23,580
I don't know if he's on now.

2044
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:24,160
Oh, he is!

2045
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:25,520
All right.

2046
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:26,380
All right.

2047
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,640
Okay, is he...

2048
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:31,320
Okay, is he...

2049
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,280
Did he just get in the game?

2050
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:33,440
All right.

2051
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:34,240
All right.

2052
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,880
I queue up one more then.

2053
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,380
Um, since I think you just started.

2054
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:43,820
All right.

2055
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,200
All right.

2056
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,980
All right, we're gonna three stack.

2057
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,140
In these hours.

2058
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:59,020
All right.

2059
01:38:05,490 --> 01:38:06,390
Here we go.

2060
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:08,570
No, it's not!

2061
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:09,710
We're doing great!

2062
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:11,230
We're doing great!

2063
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:12,670
It's not!

2064
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:15,010
We're doing so good!

2065
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:19,270
We're doing so good!

2066
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:20,710
We don't need clown music.

2067
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:26,330
I'm actually like playing the most insane game of my life right now.

2068
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:28,850
Even though I'm not locked in.

2069
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:33,230
I'm like not locked in.

2070
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:34,930
I'm playing fucking insane.

2071
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:37,070
Okay, I'm doing Hawkeye.

2072
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,730
We got Hella?

2073
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:40,890
Who the fuck said we got Hella?

2074
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:46,670
I'm actually doing well.

2075
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:48,350
Are you...

2076
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:50,170
Fucking, I'm banning Hawkeye.

2077
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:50,870
There's no way.

2078
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:51,190
I...

2079
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,250
I refuse.

2080
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:55,450
I refuse to play against a Hawkeye.

2081
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:56,210
Like...

2082
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:58,350
I...

2083
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:01,250
I don't care we wasted our bans.

2084
01:39:01,490 --> 01:39:04,030
I don't trust the enemy team.

2085
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:05,710
I like...

2086
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:07,170
I don't fucking care.

2087
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:08,810
I cannot play against a Hawkeye.

2088
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:10,590
Like, it actually tilts me.

2089
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:12,750
It tilts me so hard.

2090
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,090
It's actually one of the most tilting...

2091
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:23,850
One of the most tilting characters to play against.

2092
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:28,800
That's why like...

2093
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,440
Oh my gosh.

2094
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,020
It's...

2095
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,080
It's so...

2096
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:31,980
Like, it's not fun.

2097
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:33,500
It's basically like...

2098
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:36,140
Yeah, it's fun when you have the better Hawkeye.

2099
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,000
But it's not fun when you're Hawkeye...

2100
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,060
When your own team's Hawkeye is dog shit.

2101
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,120
It's not fun.

2102
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,820
Also, some guy, thank you for the 100 bitties.

2103
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,840
Thank you, thank you.

2104
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,420
The way you say Hawkeye sounds like hot guy.

2105
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,340
I mean, Jeremy Renner?

2106
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:54,300
Jeremy Renner though?

2107
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:56,940
Okay.

2108
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:03,640
You guys might think like I'm playing really well, but I'm actually like...

2109
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:04,140
Not...

2110
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:06,200
Not locked in when I'm streaming.

2111
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:11,040
When I'm like playing off stream, I play even better, which is pretty...

2112
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,400
I'm just surprised that like I'm doing as well as I am on stream.

2113
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:26,890
I think one of my favorite things about the Spider-Man meme is like people were like...

2114
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:28,810
Um, Spider-Man, do something!

2115
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,790
And then they're like, Spider-Man does not kill.

2116
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,130
Jeremy Renner?

2117
01:40:36,290 --> 01:40:38,890
Fucking everybody was a Jeremy Renner kind of...

2118
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:39,630
Oh, um...

2119
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,470
I remember Venom was like, follow me, guys!

2120
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:44,270
I did not follow.

2121
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:47,890
I did not...

2122
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:48,530
I'm scared.

2123
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:50,890
I did...

2124
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:52,970
I did not follow and I'm scared.

2125
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:55,670
I'm scared right now.

2126
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:58,750
Oh wait, he's one.

2127
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:00,430
Nice.

2128
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:06,960
Might need to work on my positioning 100%.

2129
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,800
I think that's like my only...

2130
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,860
My biggest weakness is my positioning.

2131
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:15,040
I have good aim, but I don't know where the fuck to stand.

2132
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:17,480
Like, sometimes...

2133
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,180
Someone break this.

2134
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:19,360
Someone please break this.

2135
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:20,260
Please.

2136
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:22,920
Okay, I can't break stuff right now.

2137
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,160
Jesus Christ.

2138
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:26,500
You guys okay?

2139
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,880
Are you guys okay?

2140
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,400
Are you...

2141
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,000
Oh my god, are you guys okay?

2142
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:31,780
Are you...

2143
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,380
Are you guys okay?

2144
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:34,600
Are you guys...

2145
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,120
Guys...

2146
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:38,040
Are you guys healthy?

2147
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:39,740
What...

2148
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:41,020
What am I playing against?

2149
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:41,800
What is this?

2150
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:44,240
What...

2151
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,580
That's okay!

2152
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,220
Okay!

2153
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:52,400
What the fuck is going on?

2154
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,340
They're not okay.

2155
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,240
They are not okay.

2156
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,140
RoboKitty, thank you for the five gift subs!

2157
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:00,320
Thank you, thank you!

2158
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,220
I need them to break this.

2159
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:05,360
I don't...

2160
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:05,840
Like...

2161
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:06,820
I want to climb.

2162
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,000
I'm just a...

2163
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,140
I'm just a dancer at that time.

2164
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,580
Like, I'm just...

2165
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,620
I'm literally just a dancer.

2166
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:18,520
I can't...

2167
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,960
Oh my god, he's so low.

2168
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,800
Like, who's...

2169
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,300
Where?

2170
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:29,940
Where are people?

2171
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:32,580
Where's my team?

2172
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:35,780
Oh my god!

2173
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,340
Just...

2174
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,480
Dance here!

2175
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,600
I can't find anybody.

2176
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,660
I'm so good.

2177
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,400
Where is everybody?

2178
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,820
Oh my god, please!

2179
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:49,680
I'm gonna stand here.

2180
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:52,320
I feel safe in here.

2181
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,360
Please just stand here.

2182
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,060
Oh my god!

2183
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,340
Where is everybody?

2184
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:02,550
What is...

2185
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,140
Where is anybody?

2186
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,060
There's a gem!

2187
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:12,840
Thank you for the five.

2188
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:14,060
I hope you jump off.

2189
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:16,420
Oh my god, you're so dumb!

2190
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:19,560
Please!

2191
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,480
What's going on?

2192
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,620
What's going on?

2193
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:30,900
Shit.

2194
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,460
My boy Gem...

2195
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:34,200
I don't know!

2196
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:35,740
I don't know what happened!

2197
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,700
What the fuck was that game?

2198
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,140
I'm fucking...

2199
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:43,200
What is this game?

2200
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,420
No, our...

2201
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:50,360
Their team is much worse than our team.

2202
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,240
It's very surprising.

2203
01:43:56,830 --> 01:43:57,780
I'm like...

2204
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,990
This cop is...

2205
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:02,710
The fucking most terrible cop I've ever seen in my life.

2206
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:04,750
And the third cop was somehow worse.

2207
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:06,710
I don't understand how it was worse.

2208
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:09,150
I don't understand.

2209
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:12,650
Oh my god.

2210
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:17,210
That is actually crazy.

2211
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:24,630
This is a GM Diamond game.

2212
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:26,130
Like, how the fuck...

2213
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:27,990
How the fuck was it worse?

2214
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:31,510
That fighter could've beaten anyone.

2215
01:44:31,570 --> 01:44:31,790
Okay.

2216
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:32,670
He could've beaten me.

2217
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:34,830
Like, I fucking don't understand this team.

2218
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:36,790
Like, how...

2219
01:44:36,790 --> 01:44:39,750
They end up having a worse comp than that we have.

2220
01:44:40,630 --> 01:44:44,190
And like, there's no working together here.

2221
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:48,470
There's absolutely no cohesion.

2222
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:54,050
Hey, do you think he'll help me?

2223
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:57,110
There we go.

2224
01:44:57,730 --> 01:44:58,530
He's one.

2225
01:44:58,790 --> 01:44:59,210
How?

2226
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:01,350
How did we win this team fight?

2227
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:05,370
We had three people that was literally looking at Iron Fist alone.

2228
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,880
He dodged my fucking...

2229
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,920
Please, that's crazy.

2230
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:16,680
Please.

2231
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:19,100
Please, just kill this magic.

2232
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:19,820
Please.

2233
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:24,760
Oh my god.

2234
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:29,580
Yeah, look at...

2235
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:30,100
Oh my god.

2236
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:32,160
I see the hit markers, but like...

2237
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:34,900
That's fine.

2238
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:38,100
I'm just gonna farm all the charge off with damage, I guess.

2239
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:39,980
Oh my god.

2240
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:42,620
What the fuck is going on?

2241
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:45,600
What's going on?

2242
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:47,360
Where's this fucking party?

2243
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:50,620
From this...

2244
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:52,340
Shit!

2245
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,100
Okay, I'm alive.

2246
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:57,980
I'm so alive.

2247
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:01,100
Guys, being alive was so much more important.

2248
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:07,320
That was so much more important.

2249
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,720
I don't care.

2250
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:10,360
I don't care.

2251
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,200
I have to live.

2252
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:15,360
That was targeted.

2253
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,920
That was actually a hate crime.

2254
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:22,460
Hey.

2255
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:23,800
Hey.

2256
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,000
Hey.

2257
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:26,920
Oh my god.

2258
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,900
Like, I don't know what your plan is, sir.

2259
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:33,340
Oh, just to beat up...

2260
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:34,120
Beat up her.

2261
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:42,410
I'm fucking running.

2262
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:45,830
Oh no!

2263
01:46:46,170 --> 01:46:47,050
I'm sorry!

2264
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:48,990
I'm so sorry!

2265
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:52,990
Oh my god, I'm sorry for looking at you.

2266
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:55,110
I'm so sorry.

2267
01:46:55,670 --> 01:46:57,050
I shouldn't have looked.

2268
01:46:57,610 --> 01:46:59,530
Oh my god, why did I look?

2269
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:01,630
Don't keep, please.

2270
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:02,730
I didn't know.

2271
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:04,730
I didn't know that was gonna happen.

2272
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:06,870
I just wanted to get out of there.

2273
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:11,570
Please, Venom.

2274
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:12,330
Venom!

2275
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:18,250
I can surely heal without worrying about my teammates, right?

2276
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:20,510
Oh, I should heal my teammates.

2277
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:22,650
Oh.

2278
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:24,690
Sorry.

2279
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:27,030
I missed.

2280
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:31,970
Sorry, I'm fucking...

2281
01:47:31,970 --> 01:47:33,170
Oh my god, sir.

2282
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:35,110
Oh my god!

2283
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:37,470
From one hit to the next!

2284
01:47:44,510 --> 01:47:45,110
Okay.

2285
01:47:47,110 --> 01:47:49,050
Like, I don't know.

2286
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:49,630
Let's just...

2287
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:52,850
Oh my god, like, what do I do?

2288
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:54,790
Literally from one...

2289
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:58,770
From one flanker to the second flanker.

2290
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:01,370
Like, I just...

2291
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:02,110
I just die.

2292
01:48:04,730 --> 01:48:06,410
Like, literally, it's just...

2293
01:48:06,410 --> 01:48:07,410
It's just you die.

2294
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:13,210
Please, just kill him.

2295
01:48:14,210 --> 01:48:16,010
How does he have so much...

2296
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:16,870
I'm just leaving.

2297
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:18,650
Go.

2298
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:20,310
I'm capping.

2299
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:23,090
Guys, we didn't cap.

2300
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:24,290
Oh, it's just Venom.

2301
01:48:24,850 --> 01:48:28,650
I like how we, like, shot four people and then none of us capped it.

2302
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:33,590
We literally killed everybody and no one capped.

2303
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:39,730
Alright.

2304
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:43,070
We did that...

2305
01:48:43,330 --> 01:48:46,790
What the fuck was that game?

2306
01:48:47,410 --> 01:48:48,730
What the fuck?

2307
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:51,890
What the fuck was that game?

2308
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:05,730
Alright.

2309
01:49:09,610 --> 01:49:11,550
Alright, my duo might leave.

2310
01:49:11,830 --> 01:49:12,570
But that's okay.

2311
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:13,730
We got...

2312
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:14,930
We got Mac in.

2313
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:18,130
Oh my god, did I got plus 16?

2314
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:19,650
Oh my god.

2315
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:21,470
Okay.

2316
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:25,950
I got plus 16.

2317
01:49:26,510 --> 01:49:27,030
Okay.

2318
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:28,650
Alright.

2319
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:30,090
That's fine.

2320
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:35,050
Oh my god.

2321
01:49:35,050 --> 01:49:36,770
How the fuck did I...

2322
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:38,310
Oh, it's because I was in a diamond...

2323
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:39,490
Mostly diamond lobby.

2324
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:40,790
That's why.

2325
01:49:41,130 --> 01:49:42,030
Oh my gosh.

2326
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:42,970
Okay, now I know.

2327
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:45,330
It's because I was in a mostly diamond lobby.

2328
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:46,490
That's why.

2329
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:49,550
That's why.

2330
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:51,010
I was, like, so confused.

2331
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:54,250
I was like, how the fuck am I getting lower ELO?

2332
01:49:59,390 --> 01:50:02,150
Okay, this time I really shouldn't get low ELO for this.

2333
01:50:02,190 --> 01:50:03,110
This is a GM3.

2334
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:04,510
It's a GM2 lobby.

2335
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:09,270
Yeah, yeah.

2336
01:50:12,590 --> 01:50:13,710
This is fine.

2337
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:24,960
Do we just ban Hulk then?

2338
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:35,900
That guy is a terrible Hulk if he's...

2339
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:41,420
Okay, I'm banning Hawkeye.

2340
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:42,260
I don't fucking care.

2341
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,880
I'm banning Hawkeye.

2342
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:46,860
I don't care.

2343
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,180
I'm not playing against the Hawkeye.

2344
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:50,800
Do not make me play against the fucking Hawkeye.

2345
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,100
I swear to god.

2346
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:53,800
I would...

2347
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:55,580
I'm gonna freak out.

2348
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:06,970
Bro!

2349
01:51:07,530 --> 01:51:08,870
My dude roasted me.

2350
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:10,370
They're like, you're level 37.

2351
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:11,530
Get a fucking life.

2352
01:51:11,730 --> 01:51:12,450
Oh my god.

2353
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:16,230
Oh my god.

2354
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,730
It's fine.

2355
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:17,570
I can play Mantis.

2356
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:20,310
Wait, is PvC xQc?

2357
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:22,090
Oh my god.

2358
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:23,170
Do we have xQc on our team?

2359
01:51:23,570 --> 01:51:24,090
All right.

2360
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:25,670
Do we actually have to comp?

2361
01:51:25,850 --> 01:51:26,690
Oh my god.

2362
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:27,230
Fuck.

2363
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:27,610
Okay.

2364
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,330
Okay, give me a sec.

2365
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:34,230
I'm higher.

2366
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:35,890
Okay, let's see.

2367
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:37,870
Where's my push to talk?

2368
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:39,730
Oh my god.

2369
01:51:42,570 --> 01:51:43,330
All right.

2370
01:51:47,610 --> 01:51:48,490
Let's see.

2371
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:49,730
Mikebot.

2372
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:52,150
Yeah, I'll put it at 75.

2373
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:55,350
There we go.

2374
01:51:59,330 --> 01:51:59,790
All right.

2375
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:02,010
I don't want him to yell at me.

2376
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:02,790
So I'll comp.

2377
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:05,310
His chat's gonna yell at me because I'm comping.

2378
01:52:06,650 --> 01:52:07,510
There's no winning.

2379
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:08,690
There's no winning.

2380
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:12,570
I had to don't comp and I get roasted and then I comp and also get roasted.

2381
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:14,870
Like, there's no winning.

2382
01:52:14,870 --> 01:52:14,970
There's no winning.

2383
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:17,490
Real.

2384
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:21,470
But if I win, then there's a win.

2385
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:23,050
Then it'll be fine.

2386
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:28,190
Yeah, if I win, then I get less roasted.

2387
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:42,350
Upload.

2388
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:44,430
Kill my clone.

2389
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:45,930
All right.

2390
01:52:46,570 --> 01:52:47,610
Oh my god.

2391
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:51,030
It's fine.

2392
01:52:51,130 --> 01:52:52,510
Everything will be fine.

2393
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:54,430
Now damage boost.

2394
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:59,240
It's fine.

2395
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:01,180
It's fine.

2396
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,300
We're so healthy.

2397
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,400
I need to be careful because they have Ironman.

2398
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:05,480
Ironman's so fucking scary.

2399
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:06,740
But like, good play.

2400
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:11,230
Okay.

2401
01:53:12,690 --> 01:53:13,370
Nice.

2402
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:18,110
Oh my god.

2403
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:24,150
Oh.

2404
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:26,490
I'm trying to heal.

2405
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:32,930
Oh.

2406
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:35,410
Oh my god, please.

2407
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:36,890
Oh, you're so far from heals.

2408
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:42,870
Okay.

2409
01:53:43,470 --> 01:53:45,410
I have to heal this.

2410
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:46,310
I ulted.

2411
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:47,590
Just push up.

2412
01:53:50,670 --> 01:53:52,050
Okay, it's fine.

2413
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:54,470
Fuck one.

2414
01:53:56,190 --> 01:53:57,690
We're absolutely sublime, by the way.

2415
01:54:00,150 --> 01:54:01,570
Oh my god.

2416
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:04,390
Behind us, behind us.

2417
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:08,230
No, no, it's okay.

2418
01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:09,670
It's okay.

2419
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:14,390
I'm backing up.

2420
01:54:20,690 --> 01:54:21,530
Oh,

2421
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:27,090
goodbye, guys.

2422
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:29,890
Where did he go?

2423
01:54:32,370 --> 01:54:33,490
Oh my god.

2424
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:35,090
I don't know where he went.

2425
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:37,070
I don't- where did he go?

2426
01:54:42,350 --> 01:54:43,870
Where did he go?

2427
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:47,150
I was like, where did he go?

2428
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:52,550
I was trying to fucking- trying to kill him for- Oh, she's low, she's low.

2429
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,450
Hulk behind us.

2430
01:54:59,470 --> 01:55:00,070
Oh my god.

2431
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,360
Oh, there's a huge ult.

2432
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:14,660
Nice.

2433
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:16,940
We could stagger Bruce if we want to.

2434
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:19,460
Nope, guess we don't.

2435
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,320
Oh.

2436
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:25,540
I mean, of course he's on kick.

2437
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:28,020
He literally had- gets like a fucking million dollar deal.

2438
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:30,240
I would be on kick if I get a hundred million dollars.

2439
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:31,800
I won't be on kick.

2440
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,160
I mean, honestly, no.

2441
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,200
Guys, I'm gonna be truthful with you.

2442
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:46,660
If you get a hundred million dollar deal to stream on kick and it's not like an exclusive deal, I would 100- Like, I'm sorry guys, but like...

2443
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:52,880
A hundred million dollars is a hundred million dollars.

2444
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,580
I don't have heals for you.

2445
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:54,680
Nope.

2446
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:03,020
He has I ult.

2447
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:05,720
And Ironman.

2448
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:13,920
Yeah, I'm gonna be truthful with you guys.

2449
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:18,800
Because if it's not an exclusive deal, like, it doesn't matter.

2450
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:21,280
Careful of I- Ironman.

2451
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:23,120
Goodbye.

2452
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,680
This is funny.

2453
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,380
Goodbye, you guys.

2454
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:31,060
Goodbye.

2455
01:56:31,060 --> 01:56:31,300
Oh shit!

2456
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:32,440
Okay, I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

2457
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:34,020
I can- I can ult this.

2458
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,180
I ulting, I'm ulting.

2459
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:41,420
Jeff's low too.

2460
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,760
Wait, no ults, no ults.

2461
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:53,180
We can fire him and leave him in Bruce form.

2462
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:55,440
Or not.

2463
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:02,780
Yeah, it's not.

2464
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:03,360
We don't need it.

2465
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:06,200
We don't- Careful of I.

2466
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:10,820
Minus, minus!

2467
01:57:16,090 --> 01:57:18,230
Oh my god, it's okay, I'm okay.

2468
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:21,570
I'm cocooning.

2469
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:33,190
Oh, Mac, I can't keep you up.

2470
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:35,970
I'm on him, get him, get him.

2471
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:43,510
Goodbye.

2472
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:49,370
Hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk, hulk!

2473
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:52,290
He's solo.

2474
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:56,830
Behind me?

2475
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:57,610
I have Ironman.

2476
01:57:58,790 --> 01:57:59,190
He's half.

2477
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:02,750
I'm on point.

2478
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:04,010
See you guys.

2479
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:04,450
I'm low.

2480
01:58:06,790 --> 01:58:07,550
Oh, I'm low.

2481
01:58:08,810 --> 01:58:09,310
Is he asleep?

2482
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:11,090
Oh, he's solo.

2483
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:16,060
Oh, I might be dead.

2484
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:17,720
He's low, he's low.

2485
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:20,040
I have ult here.

2486
01:58:21,640 --> 01:58:22,420
I'm gonna use it to stabilize.

2487
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,060
Let's see if we can get picks here.

2488
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,900
Um, Mantis one, Mantis didn't click once.

2489
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:31,080
Find me.

2490
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:36,000
Hulk one, Hulk one.

2491
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:45,980
Strangers low.

2492
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:48,040
Strangers low, but I don't know if I can live.

2493
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:51,460
Strangers one, strangers one.

2494
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:53,740
Hunter is half.

2495
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:59,620
Let's go!

2496
01:59:05,250 --> 01:59:05,590
Yeah!

2497
01:59:07,490 --> 01:59:09,610
I'm so locked in.

2498
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:12,990
I'm locked in.

2499
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:14,270
I don't want to get flamed.

2500
01:59:16,910 --> 01:59:19,190
I don't want to get flamed.

2501
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:25,270
Yo, is that Albert Lally from Apex?

2502
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:28,090
What's up, bro?

2503
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:30,590
You're cooking, hold on.

2504
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:32,050
Do you have a lot?

2505
01:59:34,910 --> 01:59:37,430
If I lose, it's not my fault.

2506
01:59:40,790 --> 01:59:42,310
You come stacking with the boys?

2507
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:43,970
I'm just playing with Dirk.

2508
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:46,290
Are you trying to play or what?

2509
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:48,170
I don't know, I was just gonna see.

2510
01:59:50,990 --> 01:59:51,430
Bro!

2511
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:53,970
I'm playing with Dirk.

2512
01:59:54,130 --> 01:59:55,030
Oh man, never mind.

2513
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:00,650
Wow!

2514
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:04,350
Wow!

2515
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:11,710
Jesus Christ!

2516
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:16,050
Oh my God!

2517
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:16,970
Bro!

2518
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:20,570
It's alright, I told you I'm plan Z.

2519
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:24,850
Guys, I told you guys.

2520
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,050
I was on plan Z.

2521
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:32,470
Holy crap!

2522
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:41,230
I know my place, I've accepted it.

2523
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:46,290
I have accepted my fucking place in the hierarchy.

2524
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:57,790
Oh my God, I've accepted it.

2525
02:00:57,990 --> 02:01:00,230
This is my place.

2526
02:01:07,310 --> 02:01:08,230
Strange is low.

2527
02:01:09,570 --> 02:01:10,710
Hulk is sleeping.

2528
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:17,360
Bro.

2529
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:25,900
I don't have heals, I don't have heals.

2530
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:28,460
Hulk is half, Hulk is one.

2531
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:36,040
Strange is asleep.

2532
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,120
Strange is half.

2533
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:43,720
I'm gonna use this to engage.

2534
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:46,680
Strange one, strange one, strange one!

2535
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,640
Behind us!

2536
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:50,340
Oh!

2537
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:54,880
Oh hey, I'm back.

2538
02:01:56,580 --> 02:02:00,940
Guys, it's okay, I know my place.

2539
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:01,600
I'm plan Z.

2540
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,420
I'm plan Z, it's okay.

2541
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:10,060
This is why I play these hours.

2542
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:16,500
It's okay, I've accepted it, guys.

2543
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:18,500
I've accepted it.

2544
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:21,180
I say as I cry.

2545
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:24,520
I close my eyes and cry.

2546
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:27,380
Guys, I've accepted it, I swear.

2547
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,300
Oh my God, that's crazy.

2548
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:47,290
Oh my God, I'm alive, I was not paying attention.

2549
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:48,870
I cannot hit you.

2550
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:54,150
Strange is half.

2551
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:00,830
Jesus.

2552
02:03:07,490 --> 02:03:08,830
Oh my God.

2553
02:03:10,190 --> 02:03:11,170
Panther behind us.

2554
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:13,990
He's half, he's half, he's one!

2555
02:03:16,510 --> 02:03:17,450
Uh-oh.

2556
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:20,850
I fucked up my sleep there.

2557
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:30,630
Strange can die.

2558
02:03:32,350 --> 02:03:33,150
Hawkeye's ult.

2559
02:03:35,230 --> 02:03:36,410
Yeah, he has ult.

2560
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:40,930
I have sleep, he's asleep.

2561
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:44,890
Hawkeye's half.

2562
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:53,270
Oh no.

2563
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:58,270
I always get hit by the back.

2564
02:04:01,330 --> 02:04:03,050
I never live.

2565
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:06,020
Always gets me.

2566
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,420
Oh my God.

2567
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:16,940
I can use my mantis ult to engage.

2568
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:18,680
Oh, we got help here, Starlord.

2569
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,740
Go, go, go, go, go.

2570
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:25,340
I damaged booster, Starlord.

2571
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,360
Strange is asleep, Strange is one!

2572
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:33,720
There's Iron Man in front.

2573
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:37,400
Hawkeye, Hawkeye, Hawkeye.

2574
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:40,500
I'm ulting.

2575
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:44,920
Okay, we should have three on cart.

2576
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:46,520
Three on cart.

2577
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:53,340
We can shred mantis.

2578
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:56,160
I'm asleep.

2579
02:04:57,380 --> 02:04:58,460
That's huge, that's huge.

2580
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:04,140
Iron Man behind, Iron Man behind!

2581
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:09,230
No!

2582
02:05:15,490 --> 02:05:17,350
I'm spawning in back now.

2583
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:19,390
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

2584
02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:20,370
I still sleep.

2585
02:05:23,530 --> 02:05:24,010
Hello?

2586
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:26,050
Where's Banner, Bruce, Bruce?

2587
02:05:35,330 --> 02:05:35,810
Yippee!

2588
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:38,770
Alright, we did it.

2589
02:05:39,650 --> 02:05:41,330
Oh wait, we didn't do it, we didn't do it.

2590
02:05:41,830 --> 02:05:43,230
I'm fucking running in.

2591
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:44,970
Yippee!

2592
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:54,070
We did it.

2593
02:05:55,110 --> 02:05:56,230
He ulted.

2594
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:00,710
Winners don't get flamed.

2595
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:01,250
Yeah!

2596
02:06:02,290 --> 02:06:03,890
That's the only reason why I try.

2597
02:06:04,190 --> 02:06:05,810
I don't want to get flamed by xQc.

2598
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:11,870
I would never join comps unless I'm like, do I want to get flamed or not?

2599
02:06:11,950 --> 02:06:13,090
And I'm like, I don't want to get flamed.

2600
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:15,530
Are you fucking...

2601
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:17,350
Are you serious?

2602
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:19,050
Are you serious?

2603
02:06:19,590 --> 02:06:21,250
I just needed 21.

2604
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:22,790
Oh my god.

2605
02:06:23,650 --> 02:06:25,030
That's fucked.

2606
02:06:26,110 --> 02:06:27,670
That's fucked.

2607
02:06:28,170 --> 02:06:29,270
Oh my god.

2608
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:11,720
Oh my god.

2609
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:11,900
Oh my god.

2610
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:12,700
That was so...

2611
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:15,160
I can't believe they did that.

2612
02:07:28,150 --> 02:07:28,790
Okay.

2613
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:32,250
Alright, let's...

2614
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:36,310
Let's see.

2615
02:07:36,630 --> 02:07:38,090
Let's turn...

2616
02:07:38,090 --> 02:07:39,390
Let me just...

2617
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:41,150
Let me just...

2618
02:07:41,150 --> 02:07:42,830
You know what that means, guys.

2619
02:07:43,370 --> 02:07:45,410
It's time to...

2620
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:47,830
Turn voice chat off.

2621
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:48,790
You know what that means.

2622
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:52,330
You know what that means.

2623
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:53,810
Where is it though?

2624
02:07:53,970 --> 02:07:56,170
Where is my fucking thing?

2625
02:07:56,730 --> 02:07:57,310
Okay.

2626
02:08:00,070 --> 02:08:01,350
Voice chat.

2627
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:04,650
Where the fuck... Oh, it's communication, right?

2628
02:08:04,730 --> 02:08:05,310
There you go.

2629
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:07,730
There we go.

2630
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:10,390
Thank you for 10 gifted subs!

2631
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:12,030
Thank you, thank you.

2632
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:13,910
Back to this.

2633
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:28,700
That's crazy.

2634
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:30,460
Back to the grind.

2635
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:47,660
Alright.

2636
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:48,380
Let's see.

2637
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:49,700
I mean, we do have a third.

2638
02:09:01,530 --> 02:09:03,430
Alright, we're one off the GM too.

2639
02:09:04,590 --> 02:09:05,990
Grind never stops.

2640
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:14,890
Oh my god.

2641
02:09:15,410 --> 02:09:16,730
That's actually crazy.

2642
02:09:16,970 --> 02:09:17,730
Holy fuck.

2643
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:18,530
Also, Pyroblast!

2644
02:09:18,670 --> 02:09:20,190
Thank you for 10 gifted subs!

2645
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:21,350
Thank you!

2646
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:23,390
I really appreciate it.

2647
02:09:26,030 --> 02:09:27,270
I'll never forget.

2648
02:09:28,170 --> 02:09:28,530
Oh my god.

2649
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:31,410
Three instant... Three insta...

2650
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:32,690
Fucking...

2651
02:09:32,690 --> 02:09:34,150
DPS pings.

2652
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:34,850
I love it.

2653
02:09:35,110 --> 02:09:36,070
That's what you love to see.

2654
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:37,770
That's what you love to see.

2655
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:49,550
Nah, I'm good.

2656
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:52,890
Guys, I'm okay.

2657
02:09:53,490 --> 02:09:54,810
I'm so okay.

2658
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:58,690
Thank you for the raid!

2659
02:09:58,910 --> 02:09:59,790
Thank you!

2660
02:09:59,790 --> 02:10:00,930
Thank you for those who were needed.

2661
02:10:01,610 --> 02:10:03,230
For the messed up roads.

2662
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:04,770
Okay, I've accepted it.

2663
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:07,630
There's tears behind...

2664
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:10,550
Clenched out tears behind my eyes.

2665
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:14,070
She lied as easily as she breathed.

2666
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:19,790
Oh shit.

2667
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:21,730
Whoops, sorry.

2668
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:23,510
Oh, thank god.

2669
02:10:23,650 --> 02:10:24,590
Okay, I was like...

2670
02:10:24,590 --> 02:10:27,330
I swear to god.

2671
02:10:27,330 --> 02:10:29,970
I hope that player is fucking garbage.

2672
02:10:30,270 --> 02:10:31,710
Compared to...

2673
02:10:31,710 --> 02:10:33,750
I play Rocky Raccoon.

2674
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:34,670
Because we have...

2675
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:36,190
Literally have two fucking...

2676
02:10:39,950 --> 02:10:42,230
Please call for infinite.

2677
02:10:42,670 --> 02:10:43,590
If you can.

2678
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:50,050
Tears don't fall, they crash around me.

2679
02:10:50,890 --> 02:10:51,890
No, basically...

2680
02:10:52,690 --> 02:10:54,250
xQc asked...

2681
02:10:54,250 --> 02:10:56,110
Mac if he wanted to like...

2682
02:10:56,450 --> 02:10:57,730
Stack with xQc.

2683
02:10:58,130 --> 02:10:59,390
And then...

2684
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,730
Mac was like...

2685
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:04,630
I'm with Doki right now, unless you want to join us.

2686
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:06,810
And then xQc was like...

2687
02:11:06,810 --> 02:11:07,270
Nah, I'm good.

2688
02:11:13,770 --> 02:11:15,750
It's a TLDR.

2689
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:21,010
It's a TLDR of what happened.

2690
02:11:21,010 --> 02:11:21,310
No!

2691
02:11:24,850 --> 02:11:26,670
I was just like, it's okay.

2692
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:29,030
I've accepted my place in...

2693
02:11:29,550 --> 02:11:31,590
I've accepted my place in...

2694
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:32,910
In Marvel Rivals.

2695
02:11:39,170 --> 02:11:41,790
Most likely, this is a bad armor pack.

2696
02:11:41,970 --> 02:11:43,570
Just because like...

2697
02:11:46,990 --> 02:11:48,550
This might be a bad armor pack.

2698
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:50,070
Just because like...

2699
02:11:50,070 --> 02:11:52,310
If they TP behind us, we're fucked.

2700
02:12:03,190 --> 02:12:05,610
Let's just hope I don't get fucked up.

2701
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:10,210
Alright, I'm just putting this for Hella.

2702
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:13,550
It'll be fine.

2703
02:12:13,630 --> 02:12:15,270
They're not gonna break my walls, right?

2704
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:16,690
They're not gonna break it, right guys?

2705
02:12:17,250 --> 02:12:19,070
They're not gonna...

2706
02:12:19,070 --> 02:12:21,190
They're not gonna break my...

2707
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:24,490
They're not gonna break my fucking tower, right?

2708
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:25,730
It's fine.

2709
02:12:27,130 --> 02:12:28,490
They're not gonna break it.

2710
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:32,330
They're not gonna break this.

2711
02:12:32,630 --> 02:12:33,910
That's the only thing I'm worried about.

2712
02:12:33,970 --> 02:12:34,910
They're just gonna break this.

2713
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:36,850
My little thing here.

2714
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:39,410
It's fine.

2715
02:12:39,550 --> 02:12:40,390
They don't know I'm up here.

2716
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:40,890
They're okay.

2717
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:41,750
It's safe.

2718
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:43,310
I'm in my safe place.

2719
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:46,170
I'm in my safe place right here.

2720
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:48,890
It's fine.

2721
02:12:48,970 --> 02:12:49,790
I'm so healthy.

2722
02:12:50,170 --> 02:12:51,430
I'm so healthy.

2723
02:12:52,330 --> 02:12:53,570
I'm so healthy.

2724
02:12:54,210 --> 02:12:55,610
You're so healthy too.

2725
02:12:56,030 --> 02:12:56,950
You're so healthy.

2726
02:12:57,130 --> 02:12:57,850
I need to reload.

2727
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:58,750
But you're so healthy.

2728
02:12:59,130 --> 02:13:00,610
You're so fucking healthy.

2729
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:02,430
Oh my god.

2730
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:03,350
Look at you go.

2731
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:04,810
You're so healthy.

2732
02:13:05,150 --> 02:13:06,510
Look at you go.

2733
02:13:06,990 --> 02:13:08,310
Oh my god.

2734
02:13:10,070 --> 02:13:11,070
Oh god.

2735
02:13:11,170 --> 02:13:11,470
Okay.

2736
02:13:11,470 --> 02:13:11,530
Okay.

2737
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:13,450
You're still so fucking healthy.

2738
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:20,130
Fucking here.

2739
02:13:22,610 --> 02:13:26,030
I just come in and go goodbye.

2740
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:29,190
There you go.

2741
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:31,550
I'm doing my job.

2742
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:34,130
I'm doing my fucking job.

2743
02:13:34,850 --> 02:13:35,470
Let's go.

2744
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:38,030
Back to my hidey hole.

2745
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:44,670
The thing is, they can and they...

2746
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:45,430
Okay, wait.

2747
02:13:45,570 --> 02:13:46,490
Did they break this?

2748
02:13:47,830 --> 02:13:48,570
I'm sorry.

2749
02:13:48,610 --> 02:13:49,750
I didn't realize this was broken.

2750
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:53,690
I didn't realize they broke it.

2751
02:13:53,730 --> 02:13:54,810
I was like, wait a minute.

2752
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:56,110
What the hell?

2753
02:13:57,310 --> 02:13:57,830
Okay.

2754
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:01,310
Okay.

2755
02:14:01,670 --> 02:14:01,990
There you go.

2756
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:06,130
Come fucking live.

2757
02:14:06,610 --> 02:14:07,130
Live.

2758
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:12,210
Live.

2759
02:14:13,970 --> 02:14:18,470
There you go.

2760
02:14:19,010 --> 02:14:19,430
Live.

2761
02:14:19,910 --> 02:14:20,870
You have infinite.

2762
02:14:21,570 --> 02:14:23,290
Oh my god.

2763
02:14:24,350 --> 02:14:26,650
Oh my god.

2764
02:14:28,430 --> 02:14:30,990
Oh my god.

2765
02:14:31,210 --> 02:14:33,030
Okay, we don't stand there.

2766
02:14:36,770 --> 02:14:39,830
Oh, that's a lot of stuff.

2767
02:14:40,970 --> 02:14:42,350
That's a lot.

2768
02:14:42,790 --> 02:14:43,550
Whoa.

2769
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:45,790
Whoa.

2770
02:14:45,990 --> 02:14:48,590
I'm alive, but at what cost?

2771
02:14:49,930 --> 02:14:51,010
Good luck.

2772
02:14:51,790 --> 02:14:52,310
Alright.

2773
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:54,310
Yes, I leave now.

2774
02:14:54,810 --> 02:14:55,250
Goodbye.

2775
02:14:57,490 --> 02:14:58,670
You know what?

2776
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:02,010
I'm proud of us for living that long.

2777
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:06,390
I don't have...

2778
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:06,970
It's okay.

2779
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:14,090
I'm okay.

2780
02:15:14,270 --> 02:15:15,050
I'm fucking crawling.

2781
02:15:17,290 --> 02:15:18,630
I'm a little rat.

2782
02:15:18,990 --> 02:15:19,950
I'm a little rat.

2783
02:15:20,330 --> 02:15:21,390
Oh, fuck!

2784
02:15:24,470 --> 02:15:26,070
Oh my god.

2785
02:15:26,170 --> 02:15:28,050
Where did he come from?

2786
02:15:28,630 --> 02:15:30,190
I was a little rat.

2787
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:34,150
I was a little rat.

2788
02:15:34,710 --> 02:15:37,730
Just a little rat having a good time.

2789
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:38,810
Riding around.

2790
02:15:40,690 --> 02:15:41,270
I'm okay.

2791
02:15:42,470 --> 02:15:44,530
I need to wait until...

2792
02:15:44,530 --> 02:15:46,950
I need to wait until our fucking punisher is here.

2793
02:15:47,410 --> 02:15:47,950
Alright.

2794
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:49,710
Alright.

2795
02:15:53,190 --> 02:15:54,430
Use your infinite!

2796
02:15:54,670 --> 02:15:55,110
It's time!

2797
02:15:56,570 --> 02:15:57,330
It's time!

2798
02:15:57,450 --> 02:15:57,930
It's time!

2799
02:15:58,110 --> 02:15:58,950
Just shoot!

2800
02:15:59,070 --> 02:15:59,450
Just shoot!

2801
02:15:59,590 --> 02:15:59,970
Just shoot!

2802
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:01,910
Just shoot!

2803
02:16:02,170 --> 02:16:02,330
Just shoot!

2804
02:16:02,490 --> 02:16:02,770
Just shoot!

2805
02:16:02,770 --> 02:16:03,210
Just shoot!

2806
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:06,470
That's unfortunate.

2807
02:16:07,010 --> 02:16:09,130
That's so unfortunate.

2808
02:16:10,170 --> 02:16:12,390
That really is so unfortunate.

2809
02:16:13,450 --> 02:16:15,350
That he didn't...

2810
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:17,450
He didn't just shoot.

2811
02:16:21,170 --> 02:16:21,930
Oh my god.

2812
02:16:22,010 --> 02:16:22,590
It's midnight!

2813
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:24,150
Merry Christmas, everybody!

2814
02:16:26,150 --> 02:16:27,670
Merry Christmas!

2815
02:16:28,190 --> 02:16:30,230
Merry Christmas!

2816
02:16:32,370 --> 02:16:33,150
Oh, is he Ironman?

2817
02:16:33,230 --> 02:16:33,450
Okay.

2818
02:16:33,690 --> 02:16:34,930
We have Ironman now.

2819
02:16:35,550 --> 02:16:37,150
We don't have a Hulk for this.

2820
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:41,350
Alright.

2821
02:16:42,270 --> 02:16:43,330
Here we go.

2822
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:46,450
Oh my god.

2823
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:46,870
Okay.

2824
02:16:47,030 --> 02:16:47,410
That's fine.

2825
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:48,450
You have infinite too.

2826
02:16:48,890 --> 02:16:50,190
You have infinite too.

2827
02:16:50,610 --> 02:16:52,110
You have infinite too.

2828
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:54,090
Oh my god.

2829
02:16:55,390 --> 02:16:56,910
Oh my god.

2830
02:16:56,910 --> 02:16:57,870
They have everything.

2831
02:17:00,270 --> 02:17:01,990
I'm staying here.

2832
02:17:03,990 --> 02:17:05,110
Oh my god.

2833
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:05,990
I'm staying here.

2834
02:17:06,090 --> 02:17:07,110
That's fine.

2835
02:17:12,530 --> 02:17:13,410
That's fine.

2836
02:17:13,950 --> 02:17:16,270
That is not fine.

2837
02:17:17,370 --> 02:17:20,270
That is absolutely not fine.

2838
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:21,230
I'm not okay.

2839
02:17:21,970 --> 02:17:22,850
Oh my god.

2840
02:17:22,930 --> 02:17:25,190
I lived for as long as I could there.

2841
02:17:29,090 --> 02:17:31,250
Guys, I think like...

2842
02:17:31,250 --> 02:17:33,870
I think we're getting DPS.

2843
02:17:34,450 --> 02:17:37,350
Oh, somebody's not doing their job.

2844
02:17:41,310 --> 02:17:42,330
Who is it?

2845
02:17:43,810 --> 02:17:45,070
Who is it?

2846
02:17:45,110 --> 02:17:46,450
Who's not doing their job?

2847
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:47,330
Who is it?

2848
02:17:47,810 --> 02:17:48,430
Who is it?

2849
02:17:53,150 --> 02:17:55,070
I tried to fly up!

2850
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,930
They don't know!

2851
02:17:55,930 --> 02:17:56,450
They knew.

2852
02:17:56,650 --> 02:17:57,030
They knew.

2853
02:17:57,450 --> 02:17:59,630
I tried to...

2854
02:18:00,830 --> 02:18:03,170
Somebody's not doing their job.

2855
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:05,610
Somebody's not.

2856
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:09,910
Somebody's not doing...

2857
02:18:09,910 --> 02:18:10,710
Oh wait, they got...

2858
02:18:10,710 --> 02:18:11,610
Oh, 1 minute 45.

2859
02:18:13,590 --> 02:18:16,630
We have four DPS players.

2860
02:18:17,430 --> 02:18:18,090
And like...

2861
02:18:18,090 --> 02:18:20,310
Two of them are not doing their jobs.

2862
02:18:22,130 --> 02:18:23,730
I don't need to say their names.

2863
02:18:23,730 --> 02:18:26,290
I can literally just...

2864
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:34,110
Damn, that's fucking...

2865
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:36,070
They're like, you need Alvron.

2866
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:48,290
Wait, is he gonna...

2867
02:18:49,410 --> 02:18:49,870
Okay.

2868
02:18:50,390 --> 02:18:52,570
Alright, I'll be cloaking daggers then.

2869
02:18:56,690 --> 02:18:57,970
Guys, I knew...

2870
02:18:57,970 --> 02:18:58,710
That's so fucked.

2871
02:18:58,850 --> 02:19:00,210
I needed like one point.

2872
02:19:00,350 --> 02:19:02,190
That is actually so fucked up to me.

2873
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:04,690
I needed one point to be GM too.

2874
02:19:08,630 --> 02:19:10,770
That's so fucked up.

2875
02:19:13,970 --> 02:19:15,770
That's so fucked up.

2876
02:19:20,210 --> 02:19:21,150
That's fine.

2877
02:19:21,370 --> 02:19:22,270
I'm fine.

2878
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:23,430
I'm okay.

2879
02:19:25,410 --> 02:19:27,110
I don't need a comm anymore.

2880
02:19:27,270 --> 02:19:28,190
I'm so okay.

2881
02:19:32,110 --> 02:19:34,090
Guys, I just want to be GM too again.

2882
02:19:34,410 --> 02:19:35,370
That's really it.

2883
02:19:35,430 --> 02:19:37,210
We just need one good win streak.

2884
02:19:37,330 --> 02:19:38,110
And then we're fine.

2885
02:19:40,350 --> 02:19:40,970
Just one.

2886
02:19:41,090 --> 02:19:41,950
That's all I ask.

2887
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:43,210
Just one.

2888
02:19:44,390 --> 02:19:45,330
What the fuck?

2889
02:19:45,430 --> 02:19:47,390
Oh, he's like right behind us.

2890
02:19:48,250 --> 02:19:49,910
I was like, what the fuck was that?

2891
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:57,090
Oh, shit.

2892
02:19:59,970 --> 02:20:02,210
Yeah, that's... yeah, that's awkward.

2893
02:20:05,350 --> 02:20:07,770
I feel like we need infinite right here.

2894
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:11,150
I mean, he'll do it by himself over here.

2895
02:20:12,910 --> 02:20:13,830
Hey, guys.

2896
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:17,830
I'm worried about us getting flanked over here.

2897
02:20:18,630 --> 02:20:20,090
Woah, Groot!

2898
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:21,090
Woah!

2899
02:20:22,590 --> 02:20:24,400
Woah, you're fucking crazy.

2900
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:29,090
Oh, my God.

2901
02:20:30,090 --> 02:20:31,450
Oh, my God.

2902
02:20:31,550 --> 02:20:31,910
Okay.

2903
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:33,970
I healed, though.

2904
02:20:34,330 --> 02:20:34,910
I healed.

2905
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:37,250
Not like I didn't heal.

2906
02:20:37,410 --> 02:20:38,490
I did my job.

2907
02:20:39,790 --> 02:20:41,950
I think he might be dead.

2908
02:20:43,950 --> 02:20:44,510
Unless...

2909
02:20:44,510 --> 02:20:45,190
Geometry.

2910
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:45,930
Oh, wait.

2911
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:47,870
I shouldn't be fancy with that.

2912
02:20:50,910 --> 02:20:53,530
I was like, what if I just...

2913
02:20:55,650 --> 02:20:56,510
There we go.

2914
02:20:57,210 --> 02:20:58,210
Let me just...

2915
02:20:58,210 --> 02:20:59,610
Guys, I just think it's a team dip.

2916
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:01,250
Not gonna lie.

2917
02:21:03,730 --> 02:21:06,150
I lowkey just think this is a hella team dip.

2918
02:21:10,890 --> 02:21:11,410
Like...

2919
02:21:11,410 --> 02:21:12,490
I think they're just better.

2920
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:19,690
This hellion is just...

2921
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:26,010
Guys, why did we not ban the two heroes that everybody always bans?

2922
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:33,050
Guys, this is exactly why we banned those...

2923
02:21:33,050 --> 02:21:35,790
Those two exact heroes.

2924
02:21:36,390 --> 02:21:40,930
This is exactly why.

2925
02:21:42,550 --> 02:21:43,450
Goodbye, Hella.

2926
02:21:44,270 --> 02:21:45,310
Please don't look, Hella.

2927
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:45,690
Please.

2928
02:21:46,050 --> 02:21:51,170
This is exactly why you banned Hella and Hawkeye!

2929
02:21:51,170 --> 02:21:52,930
I don't fucking care!

2930
02:21:53,710 --> 02:21:57,590
I don't care what other characters we play against.

2931
02:21:59,270 --> 02:22:02,730
It's always whoever has the better Hella and Hawkeye.

2932
02:22:03,070 --> 02:22:08,330
And my rank warrants, I do not want to throw all my rank warrants into two people.

2933
02:22:15,430 --> 02:22:16,450
Jesus Christ.

2934
02:22:17,430 --> 02:22:21,850
And I don't want my entire life dependent on two fucking people.

2935
02:22:25,410 --> 02:22:26,070
No!

2936
02:22:26,570 --> 02:22:28,570
Jesus, let him block him!

2937
02:22:30,610 --> 02:22:32,190
The rank warrants.

2938
02:22:32,450 --> 02:22:32,790
God.

2939
02:22:37,650 --> 02:22:38,470
That's okay.

2940
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,250
We know this is just a team diff.

2941
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:45,870
We know this is literally just...

2942
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:50,470
Oh my god, Mac, are you winning?

2943
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:52,110
I was.

2944
02:22:55,710 --> 02:22:56,910
I was.

2945
02:22:59,090 --> 02:23:00,890
It is what it is.

2946
02:23:03,850 --> 02:23:05,270
It is what...

2947
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:06,510
Guys, I don't even...

2948
02:23:09,710 --> 02:23:11,010
Oh my god.

2949
02:23:13,870 --> 02:23:14,810
Oh my god.

2950
02:23:14,810 --> 02:23:15,570
Groot, please.

2951
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,650
Groot, Groot.

2952
02:23:16,730 --> 02:23:18,570
I can't heal all of that!

2953
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:21,450
Literally, I don't do anything else but heal.

2954
02:23:21,970 --> 02:23:25,390
I don't do anything else but heal, you guys.

2955
02:23:25,490 --> 02:23:25,790
Please.

2956
02:23:26,430 --> 02:23:27,630
I swear to god.

2957
02:23:30,030 --> 02:23:33,230
Guys, all I do is just hold left click, guys.

2958
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:36,050
I don't know what you want from me.

2959
02:23:41,660 --> 02:23:42,840
Oh my god, okay.

2960
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:46,320
Oh my god.

2961
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:51,500
Oh my god, I don't even want to ult this because I feel like...

2962
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:52,820
Oh my god.

2963
02:23:55,580 --> 02:23:58,660
But like, what if Magneto just fucking dies?

2964
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:01,040
What if he just dies?

2965
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:03,300
We gotta keep going.

2966
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:06,020
We gotta keep going.

2967
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:06,540
Let's go.

2968
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:09,000
Let's fucking go, I guess.

2969
02:24:13,490 --> 02:24:14,450
It's fine.

2970
02:24:16,610 --> 02:24:17,490
That's fine.

2971
02:24:17,610 --> 02:24:18,930
I guess we'll just keep going.

2972
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:20,010
Just keep playing.

2973
02:24:22,430 --> 02:24:23,650
Do you not like playing DPS?

2974
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:24,770
Not in Healers Shooters.

2975
02:24:25,390 --> 02:24:27,150
Healers Shooters, because I'm...

2976
02:24:27,150 --> 02:24:29,470
I was originally a support main in Overwatch.

2977
02:24:31,330 --> 02:24:32,370
Like, knowing...

2978
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:32,690
God.

2979
02:24:35,790 --> 02:24:37,190
Hella is always behind.

2980
02:24:37,750 --> 02:24:39,470
Like, I don't know what to say.

2981
02:24:39,980 --> 02:24:41,770
She is always behind.

2982
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:44,710
Alright, there we go.

2983
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:45,530
Goodbye.

2984
02:24:58,460 --> 02:25:00,620
We are Groot.

2985
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:03,480
We are Groot.

2986
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,700
I'm fucking solo'd.

2987
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:08,440
Oh my god, please.

2988
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:13,520
Yeah, I have a feeling we're gonna die there anyway.

2989
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:15,780
Alright, we just live.

2990
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:17,900
I was not out healing all that shit.

2991
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:19,720
I wasn't gonna heal that.

2992
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:21,580
Simple geometry?

2993
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:22,840
Is it gonna hit them?

2994
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,120
Let's find out.

2995
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:29,000
It's like...

2996
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:35,440
When you're playing DPS and your support doesn't heal you as DPS, it's more tilting for me, because I play support.

2997
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:38,900
Because I play support in high rank.

2998
02:25:39,060 --> 02:25:40,700
So I'd rather just play...

2999
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:42,500
I don't wanna learn DPS just because of that.

3000
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:47,280
It's just way too tilting to play.

3001
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:52,340
I don't know, guys.

3002
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:56,500
Like, I'll just commit to it.

3003
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:01,160
I'm just gonna stand here, I guess.

3004
02:26:02,220 --> 02:26:03,780
This is where we live now.

3005
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:06,380
Oh my god, but who's gonna fucking...

3006
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:07,740
Oh my god, that was insane.

3007
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:09,720
That was insane.

3008
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:11,120
Oh, he's coming in.

3009
02:26:11,740 --> 02:26:13,280
He's coming in!

3010
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:19,220
Oh, nope.

3011
02:26:19,340 --> 02:26:20,320
I was gonna die to that.

3012
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:27,040
There was no living there.

3013
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:29,100
Oh my god, let's keep going!

3014
02:26:30,300 --> 02:26:31,740
Let's keep going!

3015
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:35,140
Let's go!

3016
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:37,140
I'm not tired.

3017
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:38,940
I feel like I have a lot of energy playing this.

3018
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:40,800
Let's try to keep three on for time.

3019
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:44,820
Alright, here I go.

3020
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:45,880
I'm coming over.

3021
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:48,200
I'm coming over.

3022
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:50,000
I'm fucking coming over.

3023
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:52,960
He's slowly floating over, guys.

3024
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:53,760
There we go.

3025
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:55,460
Your cloak is here.

3026
02:26:57,900 --> 02:26:59,800
Your cloak is here now.

3027
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:00,720
Don't worry.

3028
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:04,700
I did that.

3029
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:08,600
I fucking knew it.

3030
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:10,340
Okay.

3031
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:12,800
Good luck, everybody.

3032
02:27:13,860 --> 02:27:16,180
Good luck, everyone.

3033
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:19,520
Good luck, everybody.

3034
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,280
If you live, you live.

3035
02:27:22,580 --> 02:27:23,680
Good luck, you guys.

3036
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:26,560
Good luck.

3037
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:28,500
I lived.

3038
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:30,440
That was pretty neat.

3039
02:27:31,300 --> 02:27:32,220
Alright, let's go.

3040
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:35,160
We're gonna use this.

3041
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:36,960
I give up.

3042
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:37,820
I can die.

3043
02:27:40,580 --> 02:27:41,180
Alright.

3044
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:43,200
Oh, that's ours.

3045
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:44,560
That's theirs, too.

3046
02:27:46,980 --> 02:27:48,020
Oh my god!

3047
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:48,580
Stop!

3048
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:53,220
Oh my god!

3049
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:54,160
Okay, you're...

3050
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:54,500
Whoa!

3051
02:27:55,180 --> 02:27:55,200
Whoa!

3052
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:00,240
You're alive.

3053
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:01,940
You're so healthy.

3054
02:28:02,270 --> 02:28:02,800
Whoa!

3055
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:04,580
Whoa!

3056
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:05,520
Whoa!

3057
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
You're so healthy.

3058
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:12,500
I'm never letting go of left click.

3059
02:28:13,860 --> 02:28:14,460
Please.

3060
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:17,260
No.

3061
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:19,940
No.

3062
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:23,760
No.

3063
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:25,820
No.

3064
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:28,640
Hey, guys.

3065
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:31,320
Hey, let's all chill.

3066
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:32,000
Hey, guys.

3067
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:35,600
I'm alive.

3068
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:43,560
Yeah, I...

3069
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:48,460
The fact that we made it this far is good enough for me.

3070
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:51,160
It's good enough.

3071
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:58,740
Honestly, this match should have ended during the first point.

3072
02:28:58,840 --> 02:28:59,540
Not gonna lie.

3073
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:03,000
Alright, let's see who was the most under... I actually don't know.

3074
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,020
Because we swapped DPS and everything, too.

3075
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:09,480
Oh my god.

3076
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:11,740
I love this game.

3077
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:13,320
Wait.

3078
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:16,940
Are you R or no?

3079
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:20,600
Are you R or no?

3080
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:23,080
I'm gonna make Mack leader.

3081
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:24,480
I can't be leader.

3082
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:27,040
It's just the lobby.

3083
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:31,500
You're leader.

3084
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:34,700
Because I'm bad at this.

3085
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:43,840
Alright.

3086
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:46,720
I made him leader.

3087
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:51,780
I don't wanna deal with fucking readying it up and everything.

3088
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:55,640
Too...

3089
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:58,940
If I get 22 points, I make it in.

3090
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:04,920
We're just gonna put it all on the fact that maybe I'll get 22 points.

3091
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:05,560
You know?

3092
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,360
Maybe I won't get fucked over.

3093
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:09,440
You know?

3094
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:13,460
That's not too much to ask for.

3095
02:30:13,860 --> 02:30:16,200
I just need 22 points.

3096
02:30:18,020 --> 02:30:20,200
Can't be that bad.

3097
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:22,160
22 points?

3098
02:30:22,900 --> 02:30:23,420
Whoa.

3099
02:30:27,370 --> 02:30:28,610
That's fun.

3100
02:30:30,010 --> 02:30:31,290
I believe.

3101
02:30:32,970 --> 02:30:33,750
I didn't get the...

3102
02:30:34,050 --> 02:30:35,290
Don't say that, guys.

3103
02:30:36,110 --> 02:30:38,750
We just gotta...

3104
02:30:38,750 --> 02:30:41,530
We're just getting 22 points.

3105
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:54,880
Can you actually hear what they're saying?

3106
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:57,900
What voice chat people were saying?

3107
02:30:58,380 --> 02:30:59,200
Or was it too quiet?

3108
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:01,920
Because I turned it up all the way to the max, I'm pretty sure.

3109
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:03,980
Let's see.

3110
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:06,240
Yeah.

3111
02:31:06,460 --> 02:31:07,620
I could turn it up even more.

3112
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:08,640
Barely?

3113
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:10,580
Okay, it's still too quiet.

3114
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,840
Alright, I'll turn it 100 then.

3115
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:14,140
I didn't know you guys could actually hear them.

3116
02:31:15,140 --> 02:31:17,760
Oh, so you didn't hear when fucking xQc was like, nah?

3117
02:31:23,300 --> 02:31:25,060
So, you know, that's good.

3118
02:31:25,060 --> 02:31:25,740
That's fine.

3119
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:27,080
Thank God.

3120
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:28,880
No, we heard that!

3121
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:32,360
Okay, out of everything, you could hear...

3122
02:31:32,360 --> 02:31:34,280
Okay, that's actually fucked.

3123
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:37,860
You could hear that, but not anything else.

3124
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:41,100
Not anything else.

3125
02:31:45,560 --> 02:31:48,240
We should've just lied to her.

3126
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:58,940
I like how like, you could hear everything else, but you could not hear anything.

3127
02:31:59,360 --> 02:32:02,740
You could hear the fact that he fucking roasted me.

3128
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:09,540
It's fine.

3129
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:13,240
It's fine.

3130
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:16,800
I'm okay.

3131
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:19,360
I'm okay.

3132
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:22,600
It's okay.

3133
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:33,250
It's fine, she said brokenly.

3134
02:32:38,230 --> 02:32:39,630
Alright, this is it.

3135
02:32:41,290 --> 02:32:43,130
This is it, guys.

3136
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:54,700
How do we have two fucking two Iron Man players?

3137
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:55,320
That's crazy.

3138
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:00,420
That's fine.

3139
02:33:01,240 --> 02:33:03,260
I'll never have another Hawkeye.

3140
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:04,000
I don't care.

3141
02:33:04,260 --> 02:33:06,120
I don't care if I have a Hawkeye main.

3142
02:33:06,280 --> 02:33:07,600
I don't fucking care.

3143
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:18,720
Okay, Bruce Banner.

3144
02:33:19,260 --> 02:33:23,000
Oh, fuck off Oh, because we have two Iron Man one tricks.

3145
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:24,680
That's actually crazy.

3146
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:30,360
Okay, I'll tell you the story about the banning thing.

3147
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:37,780
I got over it within a day, but I was so sad that day, because like I was having a really bad day already.

3148
02:33:39,080 --> 02:33:41,660
Oh, yeah, I remember why I had a really bad day.

3149
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:47,540
I was like, I'm gonna use a form of escapism and play Marvel Rivals.

3150
02:33:48,240 --> 02:34:00,860
And then so I was like, we have a duo and then like basically what happened was that we had a Groot one trick and no, I got over it really quick because I needed to vent that out because I was like really fucking sad about it when it happened.

3151
02:34:00,940 --> 02:34:03,260
Like I literally was crying like when it was happening.

3152
02:34:03,620 --> 02:34:08,060
Because like it was like I was already having a really bad day.

3153
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:10,560
So like I didn't need that extra shit.

3154
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:13,620
So like I was just like okay, I'm gonna...

3155
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:26,400
So we got a Groot one trick and it was so funny because we had two Groot one tricks and then and then like we were all like teasing the two Groot one tricks and everybody was like locking in Groot but then we banned Psylocke.

3156
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:31,940
It was like five people chose to ban Psylocke and I was like, he he what if I ban Groot?

3157
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:34,900
And then I ban Groot but it's not majority.

3158
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:37,140
Banning wise is not majority.

3159
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:40,680
It's literally like, it's random chance.

3160
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:42,100
It's like a probability.

3161
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:49,660
Like it's literally a probability for bans.

3162
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:51,740
So it's not even like majority.

3163
02:34:53,180 --> 02:34:55,100
Oh my god, yes we got him.

3164
02:34:55,560 --> 02:35:03,140
So that's why I was like it was so fucked because like literally I'm Groot.

3165
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:07,240
And then like obviously my team got so fucked.

3166
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:08,240
I didn't know that.

3167
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:14,640
I thought because this is the first time I had a ban that was like not Oh my god.

3168
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:21,640
That's fine.

3169
02:35:21,740 --> 02:35:25,920
I'm just gonna I'm gonna fight on point because like I'm scared.

3170
02:35:26,580 --> 02:35:27,660
Like I'm scared.

3171
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:32,900
And then so like I was like, oh okay we should be fine right?

3172
02:35:33,420 --> 02:35:38,380
But then it actually it flipped to... Jesus what?

3173
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:40,300
Like why?

3174
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:43,960
It flipped to Groot.

3175
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:46,380
And then my team was so mad at me.

3176
02:35:46,460 --> 02:35:48,020
They all like yelled at me and was like leave.

3177
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:48,660
Just leave.

3178
02:35:48,940 --> 02:35:52,580
And were like yelling at me and was like you you threw the game.

3179
02:35:52,700 --> 02:35:53,100
Just leave.

3180
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:54,140
Just fucking dodge.

3181
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:57,800
And they all kept sitting on spawn and they wouldn't play the game.

3182
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:03,980
And I was so like depressed and sad about it because I was like I didn't know.

3183
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:06,340
I even like apologized I was like I'm so sorry.

3184
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:14,940
I didn't know it was like Oh my god Please let me look at you!

3185
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:22,660
Okay I I couldn't.

3186
02:36:22,700 --> 02:36:27,000
I was looking at I was looking at the Ironman If I knew I would have pressed.

3187
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:34,820
I was looking at the Ironman so like couldn't And then And then like they were like sitting in spawn.

3188
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:39,000
Like two people were sitting in spawn and was like just yelling at me to leave and everything.

3189
02:36:39,420 --> 02:36:45,160
So that's why like it like fucked me up cause I was like I had like a really bad day.

3190
02:36:45,320 --> 02:36:52,720
I was like and I like cried because of it because I was like I don't know anything Please get down!

3191
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:58,440
Okay Okay I can't save that They used Lunala too so that's fine I guess.

3192
02:36:59,540 --> 02:37:04,240

So yeah that's basically what happened Yeah he's fucking dead And then like even like my duo was like oh you're trolling Why did you do that?

3195
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:23,120
And I was like I didn't know!

3196
02:37:23,380 --> 02:37:27,380
So like really That's why I was like really sad about it.

3197
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:30,200
But I'm okay now I'm okay now.

3198
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:34,000
Cause if I didn't have like a really bad day I would've been okay.

3199
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:38,240
Like I would've been like uh fine Like I wouldn't care.

02:42:33,460 --> 02:42:34,900
Literally inting me.

3236
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:36,240
Oh my god.

02:42:36,340 --> 02:42:37,400

02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:44,400
No, I couldn't!

3240
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:45,260
There's a...

3241
02:42:48,660 --> 02:42:49,460
Okay,

3242
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:54,300
I called out a silenced...

3243
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:55,640
And I got...

3244
02:42:55,640 --> 02:42:56,280
Nothing.

3245
02:42:57,960 --> 02:42:59,420
And she was in the air.

3246
02:42:59,460 --> 02:43:00,560
Double shit for me.

3247
02:43:07,100 --> 02:43:09,420
We had to do so much!

3248
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:12,640
We had to do so...

3249
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:13,480
Okay, I did lock in.

3250
02:43:13,540 --> 02:43:15,360
I was trolling the first half, not gonna lie.

3251
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:16,720
I was actually...

3252
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:18,980
I was trolling the first half!

3253
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:20,940
Okay, I'm locked in for real.

3254
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:27,240
I had to rant out what happened there.

3255
02:43:27,540 --> 02:43:28,980
Alright, this time...

3256
02:43:28,980 --> 02:43:29,880
This time...

3257
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:30,900
I'm not gonna...

3258
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:32,200
I'm not gonna...

3259
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:35,620
No, I'm not gonna troll the first half.

3260
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:37,380
I was not locked in.

3261
02:43:41,100 --> 02:43:43,100
I literally have the orb on him.

3262
02:43:43,100 --> 02:43:43,900
She's definitely gonna go Psy.

3263
02:43:44,180 --> 02:43:44,940
So like...

3264
02:43:45,720 --> 02:43:46,940
Probably gonna be Psy...

3265
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:48,420
Wolverine, right?

3266
02:43:48,740 --> 02:43:49,120
Right.

3267
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:49,960
It's fine.

3268
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:53,100
When will Ironman...

3269
02:43:53,500 --> 02:43:56,040
Why would Ironman ult the support like they did to me?

3270
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:57,260
That was so sad.

3271
02:43:57,360 --> 02:43:58,780
That was so fucking sad.

3272
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:01,340
When will...

3273
02:44:01,340 --> 02:44:02,800
When would I...

3274
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:05,660
Just watch that happen to the other support?

3275
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:16,060
But yeah, that...

3276
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:16,740
That...

3277
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:17,720
When that happened...

3278
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:20,680
That's when I learned it was not majority vote.

3279
02:44:20,880 --> 02:44:21,380
Like...

3280
02:44:21,380 --> 02:44:23,400
You would assume it was majority vote.

3281
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:25,020
But it's literally random probability.

3282
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:26,640
It was like probability.

3283
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:28,760
And it flipped to my...

3284
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:29,620
It like...

3285
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:31,780
The fact that it flipped...

3286
02:44:31,780 --> 02:44:32,380
To like...

3287
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:35,000
They're not portaling?

3288
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:35,760
No, they're not.

3289
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:36,940
I'm so confused.

3290
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:45,620
I'm trying to like...

3291
02:44:45,620 --> 02:44:47,380
Be aware of what they're gonna...

3292
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:50,220
I'm like a little scared.

3293
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:51,680
I'm like a little scared.

3294
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:55,700
God,

3295
02:45:03,890 --> 02:45:04,770
I can't see.

3296
02:45:05,490 --> 02:45:05,990
Please.

3297
02:45:08,770 --> 02:45:10,730
I had to get off high ground for that.

3298
02:45:10,850 --> 02:45:11,590
I was so scared.

3299
02:45:15,810 --> 02:45:18,370
They are portaling to the left here.

3300
02:45:23,030 --> 02:45:24,190
There's people behind.

3301
02:45:25,170 --> 02:45:26,570
This is the place to watch.

3302
02:45:27,890 --> 02:45:29,490
Oh, my frames are dropping here.

3303
02:45:29,730 --> 02:45:30,630
There's someone behind us.

3304
02:45:30,850 --> 02:45:32,070
There's... My frames are dropping.

3305
02:45:35,170 --> 02:45:36,790
He's on health pack over here right now.

3306
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:40,490
Oh...

3307
02:45:40,490 --> 02:45:41,690
I'm sorry, I got you.

3308
02:45:42,970 --> 02:45:43,470
Oh...

3309
02:45:43,470 --> 02:45:45,230
I don't got you, I guess.

3310
02:45:49,830 --> 02:45:51,030
Oh my god.

3311
02:45:52,490 --> 02:45:52,990
What?

3312
02:45:53,810 --> 02:45:54,310
What?

3313
02:45:58,630 --> 02:45:59,150
Okay.

3314
02:46:02,390 --> 02:46:02,910
Jesus.

3315
02:46:04,730 --> 02:46:06,770
Oh no, I got fucking pushed.

3316
02:46:07,910 --> 02:46:08,850
Just back up, back up.

3317
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:10,050
Oh, this is bad.

3318
02:46:13,230 --> 02:46:15,610
I don't think I can live, can I?

3319
02:46:18,850 --> 02:46:19,690
That's fine.

3320
02:46:22,650 --> 02:46:23,670
Until I see...

3321
02:46:24,410 --> 02:46:24,930
Oh...

3322
02:46:25,810 --> 02:46:26,330
Oh...

3323
02:46:26,330 --> 02:46:26,870
Okay.

3324
02:46:30,490 --> 02:46:32,590
I thought I could get it off.

3325
02:46:33,190 --> 02:46:34,150
Look at the cart.

3326
02:46:34,690 --> 02:46:35,170
It's all good.

3327
02:46:38,250 --> 02:46:39,370
Oh my god.

3328
02:46:40,210 --> 02:46:41,070
That's bad.

3329
02:46:41,170 --> 02:46:42,810
I didn't realize he was gonna ult that.

3330
02:46:43,270 --> 02:46:45,510
You always knew to ult the Psylocke ult.

3331
02:46:48,070 --> 02:46:48,910
That's unlucky.

3332
02:46:49,270 --> 02:46:50,690
One heal, one heal, one heal.

3333
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:52,070
That's unlucky.

3334
02:46:56,260 --> 02:46:57,400
Oh my god.

3335
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:02,400
That's unlucky.

3336
02:47:02,980 --> 02:47:04,220
Okay, we got it.

3337
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:06,400
I'll let Mac ult first then.

3338
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:08,080
Knowing that.

3339
02:47:10,480 --> 02:47:11,260
Yeah.

3340
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:12,350
Be like...

3341
02:47:12,800 --> 02:47:15,840
For me, I would always do Luna, Psylocke.

3342
02:47:16,540 --> 02:47:17,330
Cause it's just...

3343
02:47:17,780 --> 02:47:19,250
Mantis does not guarantee...

3344
02:47:19,880 --> 02:47:20,060
Oh!

3345
02:47:29,780 --> 02:47:31,060
Jesus Christ.

3346
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:37,090
Oh my god.

3347
02:47:41,050 --> 02:47:43,330
Yeah, I'm getting 2v1'd right now.

3348
02:47:44,990 --> 02:47:45,750
I don't know, whatever.

3349
02:47:46,070 --> 02:47:46,510
Oh!

3350
02:47:51,370 --> 02:47:52,450
Oh my god.

3351
02:47:56,490 --> 02:47:57,530
Yeah, dude.

3352
02:47:57,870 --> 02:47:58,470
Play Iron Man.

3353
02:48:01,070 --> 02:48:02,570
Oh my god.

3354
02:48:03,530 --> 02:48:05,210
Wait, dude.

3355
02:48:05,390 --> 02:48:06,510
We do have 2...

3356
02:48:06,510 --> 02:48:08,670
We have 2 Iron Man 1-tricks.

3357
02:48:09,070 --> 02:48:09,310
How?

3358
02:48:11,190 --> 02:48:11,890
Okay.

3359
02:48:12,390 --> 02:48:13,690
What are the odds?

3360
02:48:17,430 --> 02:48:19,590
Actually, what are the odds?

3361
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:28,370
What are the odds of having 2 Iron Man 1-tricks in a lobby?

3362
02:48:28,470 --> 02:48:30,190
I think that's it, yeah.

3363
02:48:33,430 --> 02:48:34,750
That's crazy.

3364
02:48:43,630 --> 02:48:44,290
Okay.

3365
02:48:45,890 --> 02:48:47,170
I'm scared here.

3366
02:48:51,230 --> 02:48:52,550
Oh,

3367
02:48:56,090 --> 02:48:56,590
fuck!

3368
02:48:56,770 --> 02:48:59,170
Why can't they do that?!

3369
02:48:59,990 --> 02:49:03,170
Why does that happen to me?!

3370
02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:04,770
Every time!

3371
02:49:05,510 --> 02:49:06,990
I don't understand!

3372
02:49:07,610 --> 02:49:09,250
It always hits me!

3373
02:49:10,310 --> 02:49:11,930
Guys, I didn't want to be GM too.

3374
02:49:12,190 --> 02:49:12,810
Right now.

3375
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:14,450
I didn't want...

3376
02:49:18,870 --> 02:49:21,630
Iron Man 2...

3377
02:49:24,270 --> 02:49:27,430
Jarvis type Iron Man...

3378
02:49:27,430 --> 02:49:29,370
Guys, I fucking love this game.

3379
02:49:36,010 --> 02:49:37,510
Oh my god.

3380
02:49:37,990 --> 02:49:39,450
Oh my god.

3381
02:49:39,570 --> 02:49:41,250
At least it's minus 18.

3382
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:44,910
You know, at least it's minus 18.

3383
02:49:49,270 --> 02:49:50,870
12 deaths and...

3384
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:52,370
Okay, not gonna lie.

3385
02:49:52,370 --> 02:49:57,090
Elka should not be saying shit because he literally had perma-orb this entire time.

3386
02:49:57,270 --> 02:49:59,450
Like, he had...

3387
02:49:59,450 --> 02:50:00,470
He had like...

3388
02:50:00,970 --> 02:50:01,250
He...

3389
02:50:01,250 --> 02:50:03,250
Oh my god, I'm surprised I even hit 20k healing.

3390
02:50:03,650 --> 02:50:04,790
He never...

3391
02:50:04,790 --> 02:50:09,130
He got to live throughout everything because I literally orbed him throughout it.

3392
02:50:11,970 --> 02:50:12,530
True.

3393
02:50:13,190 --> 02:50:14,750
He can't save.

3394
02:50:15,090 --> 02:50:16,830
I have less deaths because of it.

3395
02:50:20,810 --> 02:50:23,810
I'll join VC after the next game because I feel bad.

3396
02:50:24,390 --> 02:50:28,090
At least the Iron Mans avoided each other.

3397
02:50:28,410 --> 02:50:29,330
That's the best part.

3398
02:50:31,830 --> 02:50:34,370
They avoided each other so I don't have to deal with that bullshit.

3399
02:50:40,170 --> 02:50:42,630
Okay, I was gonna say another Iron Man player.

3400
02:50:43,470 --> 02:50:47,450
Okay, I can join VC after this game.

3401
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:54,020
Who am I gonna banish from this match?

3402
02:50:54,980 --> 02:50:56,000
Oh my god.

3403
02:50:58,320 --> 02:50:59,900
That's actually crazy.

3404
02:51:00,740 --> 02:51:01,900
That's actually...

3405
02:51:01,900 --> 02:51:03,900
I can't believe...

3406
02:51:03,900 --> 02:51:06,740
I can't believe we had two Iron Man 1 tricks.

3407
02:51:09,480 --> 02:51:10,640
Okay, I...

3408
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:13,400
I locked in after the first half, guys.

3409
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:15,880
You can't admit that I didn't lock in after the first half.

3410
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:17,120
It's just...

3411
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:18,200
My team couldn't...

3412
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:21,600
My team couldn't do anything with it after that.

3413
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:24,940
We got no Hulk players?

3414
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:32,200
I like how I complain about all the support mains.

3415
02:51:32,380 --> 02:51:34,560
Now I actually just have DPS players.

3416
02:51:35,660 --> 02:51:39,580
You know, I assumed that I would have one tank player on my team.

3417
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:42,500
Alright, I'll go...

3418
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:43,580
I'll go...

3419
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:45,240
I'll go Cloak.

3420
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:46,700
I don't know if I wanna go Cloak or...

3421
02:51:46,700 --> 02:51:47,780
Okay, he went Loki.

3422
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:49,240
Okay, guys.

3423
02:51:49,640 --> 02:51:50,000
Guys.

3424
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:50,600
Guys.

3425
02:51:50,780 --> 02:51:51,240
Come on.

3426
02:51:51,580 --> 02:51:52,360
Come on, guys.

3427
02:51:52,620 --> 02:51:54,400
We just need one more healer.

3428
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:54,980
Guys.

3429
02:51:55,420 --> 02:51:55,920
Come on.

3430
02:51:56,920 --> 02:51:57,380
Guys.

3431
02:51:57,960 --> 02:51:58,540
Come on.

3432
02:51:58,680 --> 02:52:00,280
Let's all be flexible here.

3433
02:52:00,580 --> 02:52:03,100
Let's all be super flexible here.

3434
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:04,080
Wow.

3435
02:52:07,580 --> 02:52:09,120
Come on, everybody.

3436
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:10,700
Let's just...

3437
02:52:13,460 --> 02:52:14,100
Guys.

3438
02:52:14,100 --> 02:52:15,480
Yippee.

3439
02:52:15,540 --> 02:52:16,220
So much support.

3440
02:52:16,480 --> 02:52:16,880
Yippee.

3441
02:52:23,810 --> 02:52:24,570
Yeah.

3442
02:52:28,430 --> 02:52:28,670
Yeah.

3443
02:52:28,950 --> 02:52:30,310
We totally got this.

3444
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:33,470
That 99 was so fucking cursed, honestly.

3445
02:52:34,010 --> 02:52:38,750
That 99 was the most cursed shit.

3446
02:52:48,870 --> 02:52:51,410
It just went downhill after that.

3447
02:52:51,410 --> 02:52:54,610
After I got 99, it went downhill.

3448
02:52:57,810 --> 02:52:58,210
Alright.

3449
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:04,480
Here we go.

3450
02:53:06,340 --> 02:53:07,220
I run.

3451
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:15,820
I don't think he's gonna realize that there's not gonna be a lot of heals.

3452
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:18,100
With...

3453
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:20,560
With fucking...

3454
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:23,260
Loki Iron Man.

3455
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:28,000
Oh my god, he's alive.

3456
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:30,380
Holy shit.

3457
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:32,620
Okay, nevermind.

3458
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:34,180
Didn't matter.

3459
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:37,040
Oh my god.

3460
02:53:39,820 --> 02:53:40,260
Okay.

3461
02:53:40,920 --> 02:53:42,100
They still captured?

3462
02:53:42,280 --> 02:53:43,240
Who got off?

3463
02:53:47,690 --> 02:53:50,450
Who fucking got off the point?

3464
02:53:51,110 --> 02:53:52,630
Oh my god, Hawks.

3465
02:53:52,750 --> 02:53:53,210
No!

3466
02:53:53,210 --> 02:53:53,230
No!

3467
02:53:56,390 --> 02:53:57,130
Please.

3468
02:53:57,670 --> 02:53:59,430
Please, Outcast.

3469
02:53:59,770 --> 02:54:03,610
I have to pretend nobody other... no one else exists.

3470
02:54:06,170 --> 02:54:06,910
Please.

3471
02:54:07,290 --> 02:54:09,550
I literally got all in one fight.

3472
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:13,530
Okay.

3473
02:54:14,310 --> 02:54:16,190
Alright, I'm going in then.

3474
02:54:16,250 --> 02:54:16,550
Alright.

3475
02:54:17,010 --> 02:54:18,210
Let's fucking go.

3476
02:54:23,630 --> 02:54:24,370
Alright.

3477
02:54:29,050 --> 02:54:29,570
Woah!

3478
02:54:32,850 --> 02:54:34,050
Okay, I'm sorry.

3479
02:54:36,130 --> 02:54:37,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

3480
02:54:40,030 --> 02:54:41,270
Oh my god.

3481
02:54:41,430 --> 02:54:42,570
Oh, they have Born Again.

3482
02:54:44,050 --> 02:54:44,570
Guys.

3483
02:54:45,810 --> 02:54:47,610
Guys, I don't know what else to do.

3484
02:54:48,410 --> 02:54:49,630
I don't know.

3485
02:54:53,230 --> 02:54:58,190
I don't know if I have enough healing for Adam... Adam... Loki.

3486
02:55:00,090 --> 02:55:01,710
Merry Christmas, everybody.

3487
02:55:02,490 --> 02:55:03,610
Merry Christmas.

3488
02:55:06,750 --> 02:55:08,650
They're taking us away from me.

3489
02:55:10,430 --> 02:55:11,370
Oh, alright.

3490
02:55:11,610 --> 02:55:11,870
Cool.

3491
02:55:12,690 --> 02:55:14,750
I think we just gotta avoid...

3492
02:55:14,750 --> 02:55:17,430
I know there's a few people I would definitely avoid.

3493
02:55:18,250 --> 02:55:19,530
We just got...

3494
02:55:20,230 --> 02:55:24,030
We just gotta channel our voice properly.

3495
02:55:24,510 --> 02:55:26,330
This is where people die.

3496
02:55:26,650 --> 02:55:27,590
Oh, he gave up.

3497
02:55:30,110 --> 02:55:33,270
I like how Mac just stood still.

3498
02:55:35,270 --> 02:55:35,950
Oh.

3499
02:55:36,970 --> 02:55:38,750
Oh, there's nothing I can do.

3500
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:45,360
We need two... Yo, someone else go healer.

3501
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:46,760
We need two tanks.

3502
02:56:05,750 --> 02:56:07,490
I don't play healer.

3503
02:56:09,150 --> 02:56:10,550
I'd rather tank this.

3504
02:56:11,290 --> 02:56:13,350
Now all the support players are gone.

3505
02:56:16,250 --> 02:56:16,950
Hey guys.

3506
02:56:17,270 --> 02:56:18,730
I don't need to be GM too.

3507
02:56:18,910 --> 02:56:19,750
I do.

3508
02:56:19,810 --> 02:56:21,030
I do need to be GM too.

3509
02:56:21,110 --> 02:56:21,730
But hey guys.

3510
02:56:22,430 --> 02:56:24,630
Guys, I just need one good win streak, guys.

3511
02:56:24,670 --> 02:56:25,550
That's all I need.

3512
02:56:26,070 --> 02:56:26,330
Please.

3513
02:56:26,450 --> 02:56:29,210
I have a Christmas karaoke tomorrow and I did not prep anything.

3514
02:56:29,370 --> 02:56:30,510
I literally just going in for it.

3515
02:56:30,510 --> 02:56:31,210
I'm fucking blind.

3516
02:56:33,010 --> 02:56:34,970
I did not prep a single thing for my...

3517
02:56:34,970 --> 02:56:37,310
I literally decided what I was going to do like today.

3518
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:50,100
I literally just was like, what do I do?

3519
02:56:50,580 --> 02:56:52,780
Oh man, my original plan got delayed.

3520
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:54,180
So like, what the fuck do I do?

3521
02:57:00,070 --> 02:57:01,290
Wait, did we make a portal?

3522
02:57:01,570 --> 02:57:02,530
And then...

3523
02:57:03,410 --> 02:57:03,810
Like...

3524
02:57:03,810 --> 02:57:05,050
Nothing was said?

3525
02:57:07,850 --> 02:57:09,550
I'm just going to stay here.

3526
02:57:10,610 --> 02:57:12,430
I feel safe down here.

3527
02:57:13,290 --> 02:57:15,220
He did not feel safe down there.

3528
02:57:19,870 --> 02:57:20,370
Hey.

3529
02:57:22,550 --> 02:57:23,050
Hey.

3530
02:57:24,090 --> 02:57:25,290
Oh my god, he has a turret.

3531
02:57:25,630 --> 02:57:26,650
Oh my god.

3532
02:57:27,650 --> 02:57:28,910
Oh my god.

3533
02:57:29,450 --> 02:57:30,150
I'm fucking...

3534
02:57:30,150 --> 02:57:31,690
I don't even know if he's going to live.

3535
02:57:32,230 --> 02:57:33,070
Oh my god.

3536
02:57:33,090 --> 02:57:33,770
Okay, that's fine.

3537
02:57:33,810 --> 02:57:34,890
I didn't want to be down there anyway.

3538
02:57:35,570 --> 02:57:37,830
Where is my team?

3539
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:45,300
Guys, I think...

3540
02:57:45,300 --> 02:57:47,300
I think this is a team diff right there.

3541
02:57:49,200 --> 02:57:49,540
Like...

3542
02:57:50,180 --> 02:57:52,040
Simple geometry, guys.

3543
02:57:52,500 --> 02:57:57,900
Yeah, this is definitely a team diff right there.

3544
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:04,100
No, it's literally just a team diff.

3545
02:58:07,970 --> 02:58:09,770
Where the fuck does this portal go?

3546
02:58:14,330 --> 02:58:15,870
What the fuck?

3547
02:58:16,090 --> 02:58:17,970
Guys, can we not kill one guy?

3548
02:58:18,250 --> 02:58:19,290
Can we not?

3549
02:58:22,570 --> 02:58:26,030
Okay, I guess not.

3550
02:58:26,130 --> 02:58:27,870
We can't kill one guy.

3551
02:58:31,850 --> 02:58:34,150
I like how Iron Man player is not playing Iron...

3552
02:58:34,150 --> 02:58:35,030
No, there's no...

3553
02:58:35,030 --> 02:58:37,970
The reason why there's no reason to play Iron Man...

3554
02:58:37,970 --> 02:58:39,350
Is that there's no Hulk.

3555
02:58:39,490 --> 02:58:43,170
Plus the fact it's the worst fucking support for Iron Man.

3556
02:58:43,550 --> 02:58:44,110
Legitimately.

3557
02:58:44,930 --> 02:58:47,850
There's no reason to play Iron Man with this support lineup.

3558
02:58:48,510 --> 02:58:50,350
Because like, he's not going to get healed.

3559
02:58:50,970 --> 02:58:53,370
I literally can't look at him because I'm main support.

3560
02:58:55,650 --> 02:58:57,390
Alright, I float away.

3561
02:59:01,250 --> 02:59:01,810
Alright.

3562
02:59:02,990 --> 02:59:03,550
Alright.

3563
02:59:05,030 --> 02:59:05,470
It's okay.

3564
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:11,570
It was just a GG by character select.

3565
02:59:13,490 --> 02:59:14,430
That's really it.

3566
02:59:16,950 --> 02:59:18,350
That's really it.

3567
02:59:18,470 --> 02:59:19,030
It's just...

3568
02:59:20,770 --> 02:59:21,690
It happens.

3569
02:59:24,650 --> 02:59:25,410
Yeah.

3570
02:59:25,410 --> 02:59:25,530
Yeah.

3571
02:59:32,310 --> 02:59:34,650
There's... There's like...

3572
02:59:34,650 --> 02:59:36,470
There's nothing you can do.

3573
02:59:37,090 --> 02:59:38,470
It just happens.

3574
02:59:41,950 --> 02:59:44,630
Like, I... What do I do?

3575
02:59:47,230 --> 02:59:49,010
Now it's three more games.

3576
02:59:49,850 --> 02:59:50,650
Now...

3577
02:59:51,450 --> 02:59:53,990
Now, why does Grandmaster look like Silver?

3578
02:59:54,130 --> 02:59:55,150
Because people have egos.

3579
02:59:56,670 --> 02:59:57,770
People have fucking egos.

3580
02:59:57,910 --> 02:59:58,490
That's why.

3581
03:00:00,470 --> 03:00:02,690
Just don't heal next time.

3582
03:00:02,850 --> 03:00:04,110
No one wants to be support!

3583
03:00:04,610 --> 03:00:05,950
What do you mean?

3584
03:00:06,170 --> 03:00:08,930
You can't say, just don't heal next time.

3585
03:00:09,070 --> 03:00:11,670
When no one was willing to play support.

3586
03:00:16,350 --> 03:00:16,910
Like...

3587
03:00:22,860 --> 03:00:24,380
Holy shit.

3588
03:00:26,520 --> 03:00:29,160
4722 damage and you talk.

3589
03:00:32,940 --> 03:00:34,680
That's actually crazy.

3590
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:38,500
I can't believe he said that.

3591
03:00:38,680 --> 03:00:40,020
I can't believe.

3592
03:00:42,840 --> 03:00:44,520
He's like...

3593
03:00:44,520 --> 03:00:45,720
It wasn't blaming me.

3594
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:48,340
It was blaming our other support partner.

3595
03:00:49,820 --> 03:00:52,360
Because like, our other support literally failed.

3596
03:00:55,660 --> 03:00:58,620
He literally failed and was like...

3597
03:00:58,620 --> 03:01:00,460
And then he was like, can somebody else go support?

3598
03:01:00,780 --> 03:01:02,040
I'm a tank player.

3599
03:01:02,480 --> 03:01:04,640
Or, I'm a tank slash DPS player.

3600
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:09,400
And he was the only tank DPS player that was willing to fail and flex.

3601
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:11,420
And then, oh yeah, we got a call.

3602
03:01:11,740 --> 03:01:12,240
Got a call.

3603
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:16,260
Okay, I need to get my mute button because I like talking to you guys too.

3604
03:01:16,260 --> 03:01:18,880
I need to register the mute button.

3605
03:01:21,220 --> 03:01:22,180
Let's see.

3606
03:01:23,220 --> 03:01:28,220
Because that's why I also don't like streaming when I'm in a stack sometimes.

3607
03:01:28,420 --> 03:01:31,100
Because I like talking to you guys while I'm playing.

3608
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:37,100
But then, I know people would just mute their own.

3609
03:01:37,180 --> 03:01:40,340
But then it's like, you know, you're muting.

3610
03:01:40,460 --> 03:01:42,300
You have to mute and talk at the same time.

3611
03:01:42,440 --> 03:01:43,520
And play.

3612
03:01:43,840 --> 03:01:45,100
And there's just so many buttons.

3613
03:01:45,100 --> 03:01:45,980
I hate that.

3614
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:48,140
I hate that there's so many buttons.

3615
03:01:48,260 --> 03:01:50,000
But people are like, you gotta do it.

3616
03:01:51,940 --> 03:01:52,420
Unassign.

3617
03:01:53,580 --> 03:01:54,540
Toggle mute.

3618
03:01:55,160 --> 03:01:57,080
What's a good button for toggle mute, guys?

3619
03:01:57,940 --> 03:01:59,720
What button should I use for toggle mute?

3620
03:02:00,260 --> 03:02:01,260
I guess F?

3621
03:02:02,440 --> 03:02:03,560
Is there anything on F?

3622
03:02:08,350 --> 03:02:09,310
Does Loki...

3623
03:02:10,230 --> 03:02:11,610
We have to do cloak and dagger.

3624
03:02:11,970 --> 03:02:12,450
Loki...

3625
03:02:12,450 --> 03:02:15,410
Loki raccoon is not strong enough.

3626
03:02:15,410 --> 03:02:16,890
I swear to god.

3627
03:02:17,390 --> 03:02:19,570
I was gonna say we cannot keep doing another.

3628
03:02:21,450 --> 03:02:22,370
Maybe F?

3629
03:02:24,510 --> 03:02:26,030
No, they always ban those supports.

3630
03:02:26,310 --> 03:02:27,470
It's just...

3631
03:02:27,470 --> 03:02:27,890
Okay.

3632
03:02:28,830 --> 03:02:29,690
I'm gonna...

3633
03:02:29,690 --> 03:02:30,570
I'll do F.

3634
03:02:30,710 --> 03:02:32,510
So like, I can just press F next to me.

3635
03:02:34,130 --> 03:02:36,410
I can't do it because like, my...

3636
03:02:40,470 --> 03:02:41,430
Let's see.

3637
03:02:42,570 --> 03:02:43,430
Is there anything on F?

3638
03:02:43,490 --> 03:02:43,990
No, okay.

3639
03:02:43,990 --> 03:02:44,690
That's good.

3640
03:02:44,970 --> 03:02:45,410
Alright.

3641
03:02:46,030 --> 03:02:46,970
I can toggle mute.

3642
03:02:54,320 --> 03:02:54,600
Alright.

3643
03:02:56,460 --> 03:02:57,440
I have toggle mute.

3644
03:02:57,480 --> 03:02:59,140
I gotta remember whenever I'm toggling mute.

3645
03:02:59,360 --> 03:02:59,580
Hello!

3646
03:03:01,120 --> 03:03:02,620
Our games were fucking terrible.

3647
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:03,820
Yeah.

3648
03:03:04,520 --> 03:03:06,560
Oh wait, I don't know if they can hear you.

3649
03:03:06,620 --> 03:03:08,540
Because I don't know if I have to screw this up.

3650
03:03:09,620 --> 03:03:10,080
Oh boy.

3651
03:03:10,540 --> 03:03:11,080
Where are you?

3652
03:03:11,160 --> 03:03:11,920
Are you...

3653
03:03:11,920 --> 03:03:13,140
Are you Ironman?

3654
03:03:13,480 --> 03:03:14,620
Okay, you're not getting healed.

3655
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:16,700
Because we're low-key and we're low-key cloak and dagger.

3656
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:18,580
Yeah, it'll be fine.

3657
03:03:19,140 --> 03:03:22,380
Oh my god, my toggle mute doesn't work so you're gonna hear me talk to my chat.

3658
03:03:23,100 --> 03:03:23,860
That's fine.

3659
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:27,080
I think my... I forgot to do mine too.

3660
03:03:27,560 --> 03:03:29,320
My toggle mute doesn't work.

3661
03:03:32,300 --> 03:03:33,300
Oh, please.

3662
03:03:33,560 --> 03:03:35,320
No, my beam ran out.

3663
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:40,820
I'm just saying, you're not gonna live a lot because our heal situation is not great.

3664
03:03:41,620 --> 03:03:42,340
It'll be okay.

3665
03:03:43,540 --> 03:03:44,080
Really?

3666
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:48,560
I don't feel good.

3667
03:03:50,140 --> 03:03:54,420
I don't know, this team comp is fucking terrible, not gonna lie.

3668
03:03:59,710 --> 03:04:00,510
Punisher low.

3669
03:04:04,360 --> 03:04:07,360
Okay, I'm gonna fucking start left-clicking.

3670
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:08,340
They're very low.

3671
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:09,200
Thor one, Thor one.

3672
03:04:11,080 --> 03:04:11,600
Nice.

3673
03:04:12,500 --> 03:04:13,540
Alright, hey, we lived.

3674
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:14,420
Sexy, good shit.

3675
03:04:15,640 --> 03:04:17,300
Did he just say you were sexy?

3676
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:19,120
Damn right.

3677
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:19,900
Damn.

3678
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:20,820
I...

3679
03:04:22,940 --> 03:04:25,500
I was hitting crazy backshots on their backline.

3680
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:26,400
Cool.

3681
03:04:27,640 --> 03:04:28,980
Did he get... did he get pregnant?

3682
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:31,800
Oh, maybe.

3683
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:33,520
Oh my god.

3684
03:04:34,420 --> 03:04:36,120
Oh shit, there's two, there's three, there's three.

3685
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:37,100
Come here.

3686
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:41,500
I'm so dead.

3687
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:43,260
They have no healers, what a bull.

3688
03:04:45,100 --> 03:04:46,560
Oh, we're not... I can't heal.

3689
03:04:46,880 --> 03:04:48,100
Thor, chase me.

3690
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:53,380
Uh, you have no healers too.

3691
03:04:54,020 --> 03:04:55,320
So you have to fight without a healer.

3692
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:57,960
Loki and I are coming over now.

3693
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:02,400
I'm gonna ult when I'm in.

3694
03:05:02,740 --> 03:05:03,480
Is it worth ulting?

3695
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:04,340
Actually, no, you guys got it.

3696
03:05:04,340 --> 03:05:04,860
I don't think so.

3697
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:11,880
Oh, maybe it is worth it.

3698
03:05:11,880 --> 03:05:13,000
Yeah, I'm gonna ult, I'm gonna ult.

3699
03:05:14,640 --> 03:05:15,680
Stun on my thing.

3700
03:05:15,900 --> 03:05:16,020
Oh.

3701
03:05:18,480 --> 03:05:21,160
I'm just trying to hit Rakan with my ult and he didn't die.

3702
03:05:21,900 --> 03:05:22,060
Okay.

3703
03:05:24,880 --> 03:05:26,880
We got the cloak, but...

3704
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:29,140
I don't know if we can live.

3705
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:34,600
Oh my god, why is my toggle muted now?

3706
03:05:35,720 --> 03:05:38,380
Okay, it only works if I tab into my Discord.

3707
03:05:39,340 --> 03:05:41,940
Yeah, you have to restart Discord and launch it as admin.

3708
03:05:42,480 --> 03:05:42,840
Oh!

3709
03:05:43,720 --> 03:05:45,180
That's what I was doing the other day.

3710
03:05:45,560 --> 03:05:45,840
Okay.

3711
03:05:50,180 --> 03:05:51,260
Alright, that makes sense.

3712
03:05:52,040 --> 03:05:52,620
I'm gonna heal you.

3713
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:54,340
Just wait and get a full push.

3714
03:05:59,550 --> 03:05:59,910
Alright.

3715
03:06:03,570 --> 03:06:03,930
Oh.

3716
03:06:06,870 --> 03:06:08,330
Fine, they have...

3717
03:06:10,830 --> 03:06:11,690
They have...

3718
03:06:11,690 --> 03:06:13,330
They have Eye, Thor and Eye.

3719
03:06:15,570 --> 03:06:16,870
I'm fucking dead.

3720
03:06:16,970 --> 03:06:19,510
Yeah, I couldn't... I didn't know where you were.

3721
03:06:19,990 --> 03:06:21,410
I didn't know you were looking for me.

3722
03:06:22,350 --> 03:06:23,350
He's so low.

3723
03:06:23,670 --> 03:06:25,030
Starlord's actually one.

3724
03:06:31,620 --> 03:06:33,680
Please heal me, Loki, please.

3725
03:06:37,360 --> 03:06:38,340
Come, Starlord.

3726
03:06:40,400 --> 03:06:41,580
I got you, I got you.

3727
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:45,360
I'm healing you through the Thor and Strange.

3728
03:06:47,720 --> 03:06:48,240
Oh!

3729
03:06:48,880 --> 03:06:50,680
No, he Eyed me.

3730
03:06:51,940 --> 03:06:52,960
I'm dead here, I think.

3731
03:06:54,920 --> 03:06:56,220
Strange is low.

3732
03:06:57,500 --> 03:06:58,660
I'm trying to keep our Loki up.

3733
03:06:58,980 --> 03:07:00,400
They have one healer, they have one healer.

3734
03:07:03,900 --> 03:07:06,240
I have ult.

3735
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:07,680
I'm ulting him.

3736
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:08,940
Stand in my ult, please.

3737
03:07:09,820 --> 03:07:11,100
I got Punisher with that.

3738
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:14,580
Thor one, Thor one, Thor one, Thor one.

3739
03:07:16,980 --> 03:07:17,520
Starlord's one.

3740
03:07:18,560 --> 03:07:19,640
He's one, he's solo.

3741
03:07:20,180 --> 03:07:20,700
I got him.

3742
03:07:20,880 --> 03:07:21,180
I got him.

3743
03:07:21,940 --> 03:07:23,360
There's still a rocket around here, though.

3744
03:07:24,740 --> 03:07:25,620
He's dead.

3745
03:07:27,360 --> 03:07:27,800
Alright.

3746
03:07:29,960 --> 03:07:30,200
Damn.

3747
03:07:32,760 --> 03:07:37,160
Okay, chat, the reason why he has reverb is that I have him unmuted in-game.

3748
03:07:42,480 --> 03:07:44,340
Please, pick me, ding it!

3749
03:07:44,400 --> 03:07:45,800
Okay, fuck you, I guess.

3750
03:07:47,140 --> 03:07:48,720
Who cares about you, I don't.

3751
03:07:55,500 --> 03:07:57,120
Um, I don't know where you are.

3752
03:07:57,300 --> 03:07:59,980
I'm looking at 200 people at the same time.

3753
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:02,800
And then our fucking Loki got Bruce Banner'd.

3754
03:08:03,080 --> 03:08:04,920
I don't think our Hulk plays Hulk.

3755
03:08:05,800 --> 03:08:07,880
He definitely does not play Hulk.

3756
03:08:08,380 --> 03:08:08,860
I killed one.

3757
03:08:09,220 --> 03:08:10,260
No, I'm out of juice!

3758
03:08:11,580 --> 03:08:12,220
Oh!

3759
03:08:12,600 --> 03:08:13,040
Where are you?

3760
03:08:13,140 --> 03:08:14,460
I got you, I got you, I got you.

3761
03:08:17,780 --> 03:08:18,420
I...

3762
03:08:19,280 --> 03:08:20,780
You're getting punished, sweetheart.

3763
03:08:22,800 --> 03:08:23,740
I'm leaving.

3764
03:08:24,140 --> 03:08:24,560
Goodbye.

3765
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:29,200
Who's over there?

3766
03:08:29,380 --> 03:08:29,620
Oh!

3767
03:08:30,620 --> 03:08:31,380
Fuck it!

3768
03:08:32,040 --> 03:08:32,920
Fuck it.

3769
03:08:36,770 --> 03:08:39,290
Um, Loki fucked up his ult.

3770
03:08:40,410 --> 03:08:41,330
That's fine.

3771
03:08:41,330 --> 03:08:42,430
Cloak is one.

3772
03:08:43,110 --> 03:08:46,110
Alright, I'm cloaking for it.

3773
03:08:46,690 --> 03:08:48,030
Cloak is low.

3774
03:08:49,870 --> 03:08:51,630
Cloak is so low.

3775
03:08:53,330 --> 03:08:55,590
Standing by ult because they also have ult.

3776
03:08:57,550 --> 03:08:58,910
They have eye.

3777
03:09:00,290 --> 03:09:01,410
I'm looking to pick us apart.

3778
03:09:03,310 --> 03:09:05,290
Please, Hulk, please!

3779
03:09:06,470 --> 03:09:08,050
All you do is feed!

3780
03:09:09,530 --> 03:09:12,950
I can't heal you, I have to heal my feeding Hulk.

3781
03:09:15,210 --> 03:09:17,370
I assassinated the support, that's all I can do.

3782
03:09:19,930 --> 03:09:22,790
Oh my god, Dean, please don't die.

3783
03:09:23,590 --> 03:09:23,950
Please!

3784
03:09:24,710 --> 03:09:25,150
Okay.

3785
03:09:26,730 --> 03:09:27,830
Okay, that's cool.

3786
03:09:28,310 --> 03:09:29,330
He didn't do anything with that.

3787
03:09:30,870 --> 03:09:31,470
Okay.

3788
03:09:31,890 --> 03:09:32,170
Kobe!

3789
03:09:33,310 --> 03:09:33,930
Messed it.

3790
03:09:34,290 --> 03:09:34,910
That's cool.

3791
03:09:35,690 --> 03:09:36,410
That's alright.

3792
03:09:36,990 --> 03:09:37,870
That's fine.

3793
03:09:38,050 --> 03:09:39,350
Strange can die.

3794
03:09:39,930 --> 03:09:42,870
Oh, that's not fine.

3795
03:09:46,030 --> 03:09:47,370
Hulk is half.

3796
03:09:49,010 --> 03:09:49,630
Starlord behind.

3797
03:09:50,890 --> 03:09:52,410
I don't know what to do here.

3798
03:09:53,050 --> 03:09:53,830
I'm dead.

3799
03:09:55,130 --> 03:09:55,630
Yeah.

3800
03:09:55,810 --> 03:09:56,950
Starlord's in ult behind, Kurt.

3801
03:09:57,870 --> 03:09:58,230
Yeah.

3802
03:10:00,070 --> 03:10:02,350
I don't know what to do here.

3803
03:10:03,710 --> 03:10:05,690
You're doing so great, you're fine.

3804
03:10:05,910 --> 03:10:06,670
I'm not.

3805
03:10:06,670 --> 03:10:07,630
I'm not.

3806
03:10:09,330 --> 03:10:10,910
Okay, I'm going to restart my Discord.

3807
03:10:12,850 --> 03:10:13,290
I'm trying.

3808
03:10:14,050 --> 03:10:14,270
No.

3809
03:10:15,710 --> 03:10:16,810
Alright, restarting Discord.

3810
03:10:17,050 --> 03:10:17,670
I'll be right back.

3811
03:10:18,470 --> 03:10:19,350
I'm going to do the same thing.

3812
03:10:21,070 --> 03:10:22,610
Alright, let me restart.

3813
03:10:22,910 --> 03:10:24,130
Oh my god, I can't even...

3814
03:10:24,130 --> 03:10:25,790
I can't close the application!

3815
03:10:26,190 --> 03:10:28,870
I have to force quit it because I'm in game!

3816
03:10:30,530 --> 03:10:31,250
That's fine.

3817
03:10:31,870 --> 03:10:32,690
Oh my god.

3818
03:10:32,830 --> 03:10:33,390
Okay, I can.

3819
03:10:33,450 --> 03:10:34,210
I just need to tab out.

3820
03:10:34,550 --> 03:10:35,510
I just need to tab out.

3821
03:10:35,510 --> 03:10:36,210
Oh my god.

3822
03:10:36,270 --> 03:10:37,230
That's why my frames are dropping.

3823
03:10:37,350 --> 03:10:38,170
I had people...

3824
03:10:38,170 --> 03:10:40,690
I had max stream on this entire time.

3825
03:10:41,310 --> 03:10:41,690
I'm...

3826
03:10:41,690 --> 03:10:42,790
I'm going to freak out.

3827
03:10:45,850 --> 03:10:47,510
Alright, we're on as admin.

3828
03:10:49,790 --> 03:10:50,230
Nice.

3829
03:10:50,450 --> 03:10:51,110
Oh my god.

3830
03:10:51,210 --> 03:10:52,790
That's why my frames are dropping.

3831
03:10:52,910 --> 03:10:54,390
I was like, what the fuck?

3832
03:10:55,870 --> 03:10:59,310
Okay, I should be able to tab mute.

3833
03:11:01,070 --> 03:11:01,510
Hello?

3834
03:11:01,810 --> 03:11:02,810
Okay, let me try.

3835
03:11:03,610 --> 03:11:04,770
Yes, it works!

3836
03:11:04,770 --> 03:11:05,630
Alright, let's go.

3837
03:11:06,270 --> 03:11:07,010
Let's go.

3838
03:11:07,490 --> 03:11:09,230
Guys, okay, now I can talk to you guys.

3839
03:11:09,410 --> 03:11:09,770
I can...

3840
03:11:12,690 --> 03:11:14,350
Now I can talk to you.

3841
03:11:15,610 --> 03:11:16,830
Oh my god.

3842
03:11:19,270 --> 03:11:21,830
I'm a professional streamer, everybody.

3843
03:11:22,370 --> 03:11:24,070
Oh yeah, I'm supposed to fix this group too.

3844
03:11:25,950 --> 03:11:29,030
Wait, can you guys hear him or do I need to up the volume, chat?

3845
03:11:31,510 --> 03:11:32,810
Do I need to up his volume?

3846
03:11:32,990 --> 03:11:33,770
I actually don't know.

3847
03:11:34,970 --> 03:11:35,790
Let me know.

3848
03:11:36,710 --> 03:11:37,230
Can hear?

3849
03:11:37,430 --> 03:11:38,250
Okay, I'll up it.

3850
03:11:38,730 --> 03:11:40,230
Up it by like 40.

3851
03:11:42,010 --> 03:11:42,690
Alright, I'm...

3852
03:11:42,690 --> 03:11:44,330
We're so ready, we're so locked in.

3853
03:11:46,950 --> 03:11:48,530
Alright, now I'm locked in.

3854
03:11:50,090 --> 03:11:50,890
Wait, can you say something?

3855
03:11:51,050 --> 03:11:52,230
I want to check if the volume's okay.

3856
03:11:52,590 --> 03:11:52,850
Yeah.

3857
03:11:54,330 --> 03:11:55,470
You'll hear me yapping.

3858
03:11:56,010 --> 03:11:57,750
Okay, guys, what about now?

3859
03:11:58,490 --> 03:11:59,210
Okay, now I can...

3860
03:11:59,210 --> 03:11:59,870
Oh my fucking god.

3861
03:12:01,930 --> 03:12:02,890
You good?

3862
03:12:02,990 --> 03:12:03,790
Alright, nice.

3863
03:12:03,790 --> 03:12:05,190
Left, thank you.

3864
03:12:06,790 --> 03:12:08,810
Okay, I'm healing, I'm healing.

3865
03:12:10,310 --> 03:12:13,150
I have to look at a million people, but I'm doing it.

3866
03:12:13,390 --> 03:12:14,170
That's better.

3867
03:12:15,210 --> 03:12:15,450
Alright.

3868
03:12:17,050 --> 03:12:24,570
Oh, this is why I don't like playing with Magneto when like Mantis and Luna being bad.

3869
03:12:27,310 --> 03:12:27,810
This is why.

3870
03:12:30,490 --> 03:12:31,390
This is fine.

3871
03:12:32,630 --> 03:12:33,690
Is he too loud?

3872
03:12:33,950 --> 03:12:33,950
Okay.

3873
03:12:36,630 --> 03:12:38,110
Oh my god, I...

3874
03:12:38,730 --> 03:12:40,730
I'm fucking healing, I'm healing, I'm healing.

3875
03:12:42,710 --> 03:12:44,410
I'm trying my best to keep everybody alive.

3876
03:12:45,870 --> 03:12:46,370
Okay.

3877
03:12:50,550 --> 03:12:51,410
Okay, good stuff.

3878
03:12:51,570 --> 03:12:52,910
We're not on Hulk anymore.

3879
03:12:53,190 --> 03:12:56,430
Yeah, that's like... I don't know if that was the choice.

3880
03:12:58,430 --> 03:12:59,570
I think I'm dead here.

3881
03:13:01,950 --> 03:13:03,670
Yeah, I'm just gonna jump off.

3882
03:13:06,870 --> 03:13:08,270
I'm just gonna jump off.

3883
03:13:11,450 --> 03:13:11,970
Okay.

3884
03:13:16,540 --> 03:13:17,360
That's fine.

3885
03:13:17,580 --> 03:13:21,680
I had to because... I had to because like there was nowhere for me to go.

3886
03:13:22,480 --> 03:13:25,020
I literally was gonna get staggered if I walked there.

3887
03:13:25,640 --> 03:13:26,300
That's alright, guys.

3888
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:28,620
GM2 was really cool being there for a bit.

3889
03:13:29,420 --> 03:13:30,440
It was really fucking cool.

3890
03:13:30,440 --> 03:13:32,460
Ever since our third left, everything went downhill.

3891
03:13:32,900 --> 03:13:33,540
Always just play.

3892
03:13:38,580 --> 03:13:40,560
It was all downhill.

3893
03:13:44,580 --> 03:13:46,940
Okay, I thought they were closer, not gonna lie.

3894
03:13:47,240 --> 03:13:49,300
I legitimately thought they were closer.

3895
03:13:50,040 --> 03:13:53,440
Guys, why are we giving so much free space?

3896
03:13:54,040 --> 03:13:56,120
Fuck, I'm walking in.

3897
03:13:57,920 --> 03:13:59,120
Down in Darkblade?

3898
03:13:59,220 --> 03:13:59,600
Okay.

3899
03:14:03,260 --> 03:14:04,140
I'm in!

3900
03:14:04,460 --> 03:14:04,760
Whoa!

3901
03:14:05,140 --> 03:14:06,080
Surely Thor dies.

3902
03:14:06,840 --> 03:14:07,760
Oh my god.

3903
03:14:10,160 --> 03:14:11,340
Don't fucking...

3904
03:14:11,340 --> 03:14:12,500
I killed their Sarlord.

3905
03:14:12,660 --> 03:14:12,980
Nice.

3906
03:14:14,020 --> 03:14:15,860
If you need... Oh, okay.

3907
03:14:16,240 --> 03:14:16,640
Nevermind.

3908
03:14:18,100 --> 03:14:19,060
He's low.

3909
03:14:19,320 --> 03:14:20,800
The strange is low.

3910
03:14:22,520 --> 03:14:25,720
Hey, I'm so excited to hold this for four minutes.

3911
03:14:27,480 --> 03:14:29,420
This is gonna be great.

3912
03:14:29,420 --> 03:14:31,360
I'm so excited.

3913
03:14:31,900 --> 03:14:34,420
Guys, being GM2 for like...

3914
03:14:35,400 --> 03:14:38,320
For like the start of the stream and everything going downhill?

3915
03:14:39,060 --> 03:14:39,920
That's fine.

3916
03:14:41,020 --> 03:14:42,100
That's so fine.

3917
03:14:43,940 --> 03:14:45,520
I love Mario.

3918
03:14:45,520 --> 03:14:46,840
I feel like the strange is about to look for an eye.

3919
03:14:47,320 --> 03:14:48,120
No, 100%.

3920
03:14:48,120 --> 03:14:48,620
No, he is.

3921
03:14:48,720 --> 03:14:49,260
He has an eye.

3922
03:14:50,880 --> 03:14:51,500
He does.

3923
03:14:52,380 --> 03:14:55,400
He got one guy, but I think that one guy's dead.

3924
03:14:56,360 --> 03:14:56,880
Okay!

3925
03:14:57,800 --> 03:14:58,260
Woo!

3926
03:15:05,460 --> 03:15:06,380
Okay.

3927
03:15:07,920 --> 03:15:08,840
Okay.

3928
03:15:09,540 --> 03:15:11,940
Okay, that's cool.

3929
03:15:16,760 --> 03:15:18,240
Does anyone touch?

3930
03:15:18,440 --> 03:15:19,200
Can anyone touch?

3931
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:19,840
I don't know.

3932
03:15:22,720 --> 03:15:24,580
I'm heading over here.

3933
03:15:26,180 --> 03:15:28,340
I'm not getting out, but I'll head over.

3934
03:15:30,740 --> 03:15:31,500
Oh, I'm dead.

3935
03:15:31,760 --> 03:15:33,360
Oh yeah, I also have a third coming in.

3936
03:15:33,460 --> 03:15:34,600
I think we might need it.

3937
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:36,680
Yeah, we might.

3938
03:15:37,460 --> 03:15:39,400
We might need some reinforcements.

3939
03:15:46,120 --> 03:15:47,140
Oh my god.

3940
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:50,840
It's fine.

3941
03:15:54,240 --> 03:15:55,080
It's okay.

3942
03:15:56,120 --> 03:15:58,330
It was really cool being GM2 yesterday.

3943
03:16:02,520 --> 03:16:03,700
It was really cool.

3944
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:05,460
It's alright, I'm back in GM3 as well.

3945
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:06,860
We're back.

3946
03:16:07,880 --> 03:16:08,420
Okay.

3947
03:16:08,940 --> 03:16:11,000
Alright, let's not get... don't queue up.

3948
03:16:11,080 --> 03:16:11,760
I got a third.

3949
03:16:12,080 --> 03:16:13,300
I got a third.

3950
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:17,060
Alright.

3951
03:16:18,580 --> 03:16:19,400
Oh wait.

3952
03:16:19,540 --> 03:16:21,280
Oh wait, give me leader so I can invite.

3953
03:16:27,670 --> 03:16:29,010
Alright, let's see.

3954
03:16:31,510 --> 03:16:33,730
Wait, can I not invite if I'm leader?

3955
03:16:34,190 --> 03:16:35,550
Oh, is it because he's in game?

3956
03:16:35,710 --> 03:16:37,430
Oh my god, get the fuck out of that game.

3957
03:16:39,190 --> 03:16:41,390
Get... when is game over?

3958
03:16:43,290 --> 03:16:45,010
I thought he was ready.

3959
03:16:45,250 --> 03:16:46,490
He's like, next game I'm ready.

3960
03:16:49,430 --> 03:16:50,270
Alright guys.

3961
03:16:51,410 --> 03:16:53,430
I can't... oh wait, he's in practice range?

3962
03:16:54,970 --> 03:16:55,910
Why can't I invite?

3963
03:16:56,010 --> 03:16:57,090
Oh, because he's in... okay.

3964
03:16:57,090 --> 03:17:02,430
Do I... oh wait, he's...

3965
03:17:02,430 --> 03:17:04,030
Oh, he's ready.

3966
03:17:04,230 --> 03:17:05,850
Okay, get out of practice range.

3967
03:17:06,010 --> 03:17:06,190
Okay.

3968
03:17:09,190 --> 03:17:09,750
Alright.

3969
03:17:14,170 --> 03:17:14,730
Oh.

3970
03:17:15,750 --> 03:17:16,870
I'm gonna make him leader.

3971
03:17:18,290 --> 03:17:19,790
You're... you're leader.

3972
03:17:20,670 --> 03:17:22,690
Alright, let's add him to the call.

3973
03:17:23,970 --> 03:17:25,430
Okay, I'll add him to the call.

3974
03:17:35,990 --> 03:17:37,690
Alright, things will be different now.

3975
03:17:37,690 --> 03:17:39,250
Things will be so different.

3976
03:17:40,350 --> 03:17:42,550
It'll be so... okay, we're the three GMs.

3977
03:17:42,610 --> 03:17:44,590
Okay, no, we have an extra GM player, I was gonna say.

3978
03:17:48,890 --> 03:17:50,590
Okay, we're gonna climb this time.

3979
03:17:50,990 --> 03:17:52,070
We had some bad luck.

3980
03:17:52,410 --> 03:17:52,760
We had some...

3981
03:17:53,250 --> 03:17:56,690
We had some really bad luck earlier, but it'll be different now.

3982
03:18:02,170 --> 03:18:04,590
Our other third left and then things went downhill.

3983
03:18:05,510 --> 03:18:06,010
You're...

3984
03:18:06,730 --> 03:18:08,090
It'll be different, right?

3985
03:18:08,250 --> 03:18:10,610
You'll be the third that brings it back, right?

3986
03:18:11,310 --> 03:18:12,690
Yes, we win these.

3987
03:18:12,790 --> 03:18:13,530
Alright, okay.

3988
03:18:13,890 --> 03:18:14,350
Who do you play?

3989
03:18:15,130 --> 03:18:15,950
I play...

3990
03:18:15,950 --> 03:18:16,710
He plays everything.

3991
03:18:16,890 --> 03:18:17,630
A lot of things.

3992
03:18:18,170 --> 03:18:20,230
He basically can flex to anything.

3993
03:18:20,910 --> 03:18:23,410
No, they banned Psylocke.

3994
03:18:23,890 --> 03:18:24,390
Fuck.

3995
03:18:25,010 --> 03:18:27,170
Okay, you can flex too.

3996
03:18:27,270 --> 03:18:28,690
I saw you flexing.

3997
03:18:28,950 --> 03:18:31,250
I can flex, but like...

3998
03:18:31,250 --> 03:18:32,750
I'm banning Hawkeye, I swear to God.

3999
03:18:33,430 --> 03:18:35,010
I'm not playing against a Hawkeye.

4000
03:18:35,270 --> 03:18:37,030
Oh, dude, it's gonna be a 50-50.

4001
03:18:37,290 --> 03:18:37,850
Please, I know.

4002
03:18:38,310 --> 03:18:39,930
Ruben, why did you ban Hella?

4003
03:18:40,110 --> 03:18:44,770
I'd rather play against a Hella than a fucking Hawkeye.

4004
03:18:44,830 --> 03:18:45,830
Oh, thank fucking God.

4005
03:18:46,150 --> 03:18:49,250
We're gonna play with a fucking Hella in the lobby, bro.

4006
03:18:50,010 --> 03:18:53,250
I'd rather play against a Hella than a Hawkeye.

4007
03:18:53,350 --> 03:18:54,250
There's no fucking way.

4008
03:18:55,170 --> 03:18:55,650
Okay.

4009
03:18:56,270 --> 03:18:58,110
I'll play whatever the team needs.

4010
03:18:58,370 --> 03:19:00,590
Oh, they banned Psylocke, my baby.

4011
03:19:00,590 --> 03:19:02,710
Alright, I'm playing...

4012
03:19:02,710 --> 03:19:04,250
Oh my God, I really don't want to.

4013
03:19:05,570 --> 03:19:07,690
They don't have flankers, right?

4014
03:19:10,790 --> 03:19:11,590
Oh my God.

4015
03:19:13,430 --> 03:19:14,230
Wait a second.

4016
03:19:14,370 --> 03:19:15,210
It's gonna be okay.

4017
03:19:15,530 --> 03:19:16,670
It's gonna be okay.

4018
03:19:17,290 --> 03:19:19,630
It's gonna be okay.

4019
03:19:20,470 --> 03:19:22,770
Like, there's no way it can get worse.

4020
03:19:26,170 --> 03:19:26,690
Alright.

4021
03:19:27,690 --> 03:19:29,590
I'm playing tank, I guess.

4022
03:19:29,590 --> 03:19:31,890
We lock the fuck in, we win these.

4023
03:19:32,850 --> 03:19:34,230
Play what you want.

4024
03:19:34,670 --> 03:19:37,330
Oh my God, that's so kind of Imdrubbq.

4025
03:19:38,130 --> 03:19:40,190
Oh my God, do you think he actually is?

4026
03:19:41,010 --> 03:19:43,090
He's picking Thor on defense, so maybe.

4027
03:19:44,090 --> 03:19:46,390
He's picking Thor on defense, he's gotta be.

4028
03:19:49,950 --> 03:19:54,430
What could possibly go wrong?

4029
03:19:54,690 --> 03:19:56,110
Nothing will go wrong.

4030
03:19:56,110 --> 03:19:59,830
I don't mind being Diamond 1 again, I've been there so many times.

4031
03:20:00,150 --> 03:20:01,610
I'm like okay with that.

4032
03:20:01,710 --> 03:20:03,350
We're not falling that far today.

4033
03:20:03,950 --> 03:20:06,370
I literally need three losses to be back there.

4034
03:20:07,510 --> 03:20:09,830
I'm okay with being back there, guys.

4035
03:20:09,970 --> 03:20:11,850
No, no, no, we're not going back.

4036
03:20:13,650 --> 03:20:16,430
I'm so sad that they always ban Luna, man.

4037
03:20:16,550 --> 03:20:18,310
It's like, they don't want fun.

4038
03:20:22,010 --> 03:20:23,110
Where's our Thor?

4039
03:20:23,250 --> 03:20:24,470
Oh, there he is.

4040
03:20:25,290 --> 03:20:27,330
He's fucking in there, bro.

4041
03:20:30,010 --> 03:20:31,350
I need to heal our Thor.

4042
03:20:33,570 --> 03:20:35,210
Oh, there hell is one bottom left.

4043
03:20:35,230 --> 03:20:35,910
Oh, I should grab Mega.

4044
03:20:39,510 --> 03:20:41,930
Jesus Christ, okay, alright, Panther.

4045
03:20:42,330 --> 03:20:43,950
Oh my God, I'm a hero.

4046
03:20:46,330 --> 03:20:47,870
I'm trying to keep our Thor alive.

4047
03:20:47,990 --> 03:20:49,510
I'm trying to keep both our tanks alive.

4048
03:20:49,930 --> 03:20:51,810
Thor is dead, Thor is dead, Thor is dead.

4049
03:20:52,390 --> 03:20:53,190
Unbelievably dead.

4050
03:20:53,190 --> 03:20:54,670
You're so dead too, maybe.

4051
03:20:54,850 --> 03:20:56,250
No, no, no, I live these, I'm here.

4052
03:20:58,190 --> 03:20:59,610
But I do got a kite.

4053
03:21:03,270 --> 03:21:03,990
I'm dead?

4054
03:21:04,790 --> 03:21:05,150
Punisher.

4055
03:21:09,170 --> 03:21:10,430
I don't think we can contest.

4056
03:21:10,730 --> 03:21:11,230
Are we contesting?

4057
03:21:11,670 --> 03:21:12,790
Yeah, we don't touch, we don't touch.

4058
03:21:12,790 --> 03:21:14,130
Yeah, I was gonna say, there's no way.

4059
03:21:14,490 --> 03:21:16,310
Oh, wait a second, John Power?

4060
03:21:18,650 --> 03:21:19,250
You're dead.

4061
03:21:20,010 --> 03:21:21,050
Nope, no, I live these.

4062
03:21:22,110 --> 03:21:23,070
Okay, but I don't.

4063
03:21:23,930 --> 03:21:25,270
No, no, no, you also live these.

4064
03:21:25,390 --> 03:21:25,970
Do I?

4065
03:21:26,150 --> 03:21:28,290
I got you, I got you with the Zarya bubble, don't worry.

4066
03:21:28,650 --> 03:21:30,370
Okay, okay, I'm gonna ult forward.

4067
03:21:30,690 --> 03:21:31,150
Okay, big.

4068
03:21:31,590 --> 03:21:32,070
I'm gonna do it.

4069
03:21:35,010 --> 03:21:36,310
He ulted forward too.

4070
03:21:37,250 --> 03:21:37,730
Hold up.

4071
03:21:39,610 --> 03:21:41,970
Just play my thing, just play my thing.

4072
03:21:43,670 --> 03:21:44,070
Okay.

4073
03:21:45,710 --> 03:21:46,510
I'm in it.

4074
03:21:47,190 --> 03:21:49,590
I don't know, oh, they are rocket.

4075
03:21:50,010 --> 03:21:52,110
I'm solo healing, I'm solo healing, I'm solo healing, I'm solo healing.

4076
03:21:52,210 --> 03:21:53,290
There's top right, top right, top right.

4077
03:21:53,670 --> 03:21:54,570
Oh, I'm dead to Hella.

4078
03:21:55,970 --> 03:21:57,070
I'm backing up.

4079
03:21:58,210 --> 03:22:01,890
Oh my god, guys, I'm gonna fucking freak out here.

4080
03:22:03,130 --> 03:22:05,890
There's a Hella turret left, I can't heal you guys, there's a Hella turret left.

4081
03:22:06,470 --> 03:22:07,990
I'm chilling, I live these.

4082
03:22:07,990 --> 03:22:09,890
You're not chilling, you are so not healthy.

4083
03:22:10,790 --> 03:22:12,210
You're not healthy at all.

4084
03:22:12,290 --> 03:22:13,970
Neo, next time I live those.

4085
03:22:15,470 --> 03:22:16,650
Oh my god.

4086
03:22:17,690 --> 03:22:20,310
Okay, we're on Strange now, okay, we're good.

4087
03:22:20,390 --> 03:22:22,530
Oh, thank god, he figured it out.

4088
03:22:22,710 --> 03:22:23,730
Thank fucking god, bro.

4089
03:22:24,030 --> 03:22:25,690
Oh, I'm getting killed too, I'm getting killed too.

4090
03:22:25,870 --> 03:22:26,070
Nice!

4091
03:22:26,750 --> 03:22:27,470
I'm coming over.

4092
03:22:27,630 --> 03:22:28,390
Alright, I'm gonna shift out.

4093
03:22:28,550 --> 03:22:30,410
Oh, we're down one then, I think.

4094
03:22:34,070 --> 03:22:36,310
They have no DPS with them, they can walk up.

4095
03:22:38,350 --> 03:22:39,670
I'll help pick top left.

4096
03:22:39,690 --> 03:22:41,590
Yeah, I don't know, I think our Strange might...

4097
03:22:43,210 --> 03:22:44,030
Oh no!

4098
03:22:45,270 --> 03:22:47,810
From Trunk, you could have just...

4099
03:22:47,810 --> 03:22:49,590
Oh my god, please!

4100
03:22:50,450 --> 03:22:51,090
He's alive.

4101
03:22:51,810 --> 03:22:52,770
I'm running here to help him real quick.

4102
03:22:54,410 --> 03:22:55,950
I'm not ulting this, I'm not ulting this.

4103
03:22:56,670 --> 03:22:57,090
I'm just...

4104
03:22:57,090 --> 03:22:59,950
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.

4105
03:23:00,450 --> 03:23:01,230
I got you.

4106
03:23:01,370 --> 03:23:02,190
I'm dying over here.

4107
03:23:02,790 --> 03:23:04,170
Please kill the Penny at least.

4108
03:23:05,190 --> 03:23:07,890
Dude, I'm like babying over JonPower.

4109
03:23:08,110 --> 03:23:09,590
I gotta make sure this guy lives.

4110
03:23:09,590 --> 03:23:10,430
Guys, we're alive!

4111
03:23:10,430 --> 03:23:11,690
Bubbling him up, cooldown.

4112
03:23:11,970 --> 03:23:13,370
Oh my god!

4113
03:23:13,630 --> 03:23:15,610
And the Barbarabas!

4114
03:23:16,130 --> 03:23:16,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4115
03:23:16,950 --> 03:23:18,510
And someone help Jon!

4116
03:23:20,190 --> 03:23:21,030
I can run.

4117
03:23:21,170 --> 03:23:22,430
I wish I could!

4118
03:23:22,510 --> 03:23:23,030
Jon!

4119
03:23:24,010 --> 03:23:24,390
Please!

4120
03:23:25,810 --> 03:23:26,430
Rocket, why?

4121
03:23:28,690 --> 03:23:30,450
Why did you just run?

4122
03:23:30,450 --> 03:23:30,950
Jump hook.

4123
03:23:31,330 --> 03:23:31,890
I need help on left.

4124
03:23:32,050 --> 03:23:33,470
There's a Hella behind us.

4125
03:23:33,490 --> 03:23:34,170
Wait, who's back there?

4126
03:23:34,250 --> 03:23:36,370
There's a Hella behind us.

4127
03:23:36,530 --> 03:23:39,230
Our Rocket looked at two DPS players.

4128
03:23:40,430 --> 03:23:42,210
You know, I'm...

4129
03:23:42,790 --> 03:23:43,510
I'm dead.

4130
03:23:43,730 --> 03:23:45,030
I can ult on point.

4131
03:23:45,090 --> 03:23:45,850
Where am I going?

4132
03:23:46,150 --> 03:23:46,930
What is over here?

4133
03:23:47,450 --> 03:23:47,810
There's nothing over here.

4134
03:23:47,810 --> 03:23:48,730
Is it worth ulting on point?

4135
03:23:48,890 --> 03:23:49,510
Is it worth it?

4136
03:23:50,210 --> 03:23:50,570
Maybe?

4137
03:23:51,050 --> 03:23:51,510
No, never.

4138
03:23:51,710 --> 03:23:52,110
No, it's not.

4139
03:23:52,210 --> 03:23:52,490
No, it's not.

4140
03:23:52,570 --> 03:23:53,650
The stream just blocked me on point.

4141
03:23:53,970 --> 03:23:56,410
Dude, why is there no health pack over there?

4142
03:23:57,830 --> 03:23:59,150
Guys, I think I'm dead.

4143
03:24:00,450 --> 03:24:01,450
I can try and...

4144
03:24:01,450 --> 03:24:02,630
I can cloak you.

4145
03:24:02,690 --> 03:24:03,690
I can try and cloak you guys.

4146
03:24:04,190 --> 03:24:06,070
Wait, I need to give that guy a little...

4147
03:24:06,070 --> 03:24:06,950
They're cloaking you guys.

4148
03:24:08,130 --> 03:24:09,070
JonPower makes it out.

4149
03:24:10,450 --> 03:24:11,090
Jon is...

4150
03:24:11,090 --> 03:24:13,450
Oh, please stream.

4151
03:24:14,270 --> 03:24:15,170
Guys, I love...

4152
03:24:15,170 --> 03:24:17,850
I can't wait to fight this for minutes.

4153
03:24:18,550 --> 03:24:19,310
I'm going to ult it for it.

4154
03:24:19,350 --> 03:24:19,890
I'm going to ult it for it.

4155
03:24:21,350 --> 03:24:23,490
When the car is closer, I'm going to do it now.

4156
03:24:23,490 --> 03:24:24,210
This is the turret...

4157
03:24:24,850 --> 03:24:26,730
They're bastion turreting on car, bro.

4158
03:24:27,770 --> 03:24:28,730
Yeah, I ult it for it.

4159
03:24:28,810 --> 03:24:29,290
I ult it for it.

4160
03:24:29,670 --> 03:24:30,210
We kill him.

4161
03:24:30,230 --> 03:24:30,590
We kill him.

4162
03:24:30,610 --> 03:24:30,950
We kill him.

4163
03:24:30,970 --> 03:24:31,310
We kill him.

4164
03:24:31,310 --> 03:24:31,610
He's one.

4165
03:24:31,610 --> 03:24:31,930
He's one.

4166
03:24:31,930 --> 03:24:32,210
He's one.

4167
03:24:32,670 --> 03:24:33,270
I killed him.

4168
03:24:33,350 --> 03:24:33,570
I killed him.

4169
03:24:33,570 --> 03:24:34,450
I'm very low behind you.

4170
03:24:34,610 --> 03:24:34,990
Hella behind you.

4171
03:24:35,030 --> 03:24:35,370
Hella behind you.

4172
03:24:35,390 --> 03:24:36,610
Hella behind you.

4173
03:24:36,610 --> 03:24:37,610
I can't look.

4174
03:24:40,150 --> 03:24:43,030
The hella and cloak are just flanking together with the cloak.

4175
03:24:43,270 --> 03:24:43,870
Oh, that's huge.

4176
03:24:43,950 --> 03:24:44,230
That's huge.

4177
03:24:44,470 --> 03:24:45,750
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.

4178
03:24:45,890 --> 03:24:46,950
What the fuck?

4179
03:24:46,950 --> 03:24:48,850
It's just literally me and Magneto.

4180
03:24:49,670 --> 03:24:51,010
And it's just going to be me.

4181
03:24:55,530 --> 03:24:57,230
Oh, that is insane.

4182
03:24:57,730 --> 03:24:58,690
Mac, I saw that.

4183
03:25:00,110 --> 03:25:00,870
Little three-tap person.

4184
03:25:01,710 --> 03:25:02,790
I saw that.

4185
03:25:02,850 --> 03:25:03,450
I'm dead.

4186
03:25:03,730 --> 03:25:03,930
Okay.

4187
03:25:03,930 --> 03:25:05,930
Dude, their cloak is a demon.

4188
03:25:06,770 --> 03:25:07,250
What?

4189
03:25:07,390 --> 03:25:08,050
Yo, what's up, guys?

4190
03:25:08,050 --> 03:25:10,430
We're locked from the right side.

4191
03:25:10,430 --> 03:25:10,790
Oh, wait.

4192
03:25:10,850 --> 03:25:12,390
He trapped us in spawn.

4193
03:25:12,950 --> 03:25:13,290
Yeah.

4194
03:25:13,750 --> 03:25:14,610
We can't go.

4195
03:25:17,530 --> 03:25:18,490
This is...

4196
03:25:18,490 --> 03:25:22,110
I mean, I literally can't do anything because I'm always healing.

4197
03:25:22,890 --> 03:25:24,410
I'm literally stuck in spawn.

4198
03:25:24,910 --> 03:25:25,290
Oh, no.

4199
03:25:25,410 --> 03:25:25,710
John.

4200
03:25:25,950 --> 03:25:26,030
John.

4201
03:25:26,030 --> 03:25:26,870
John's doing stuff.

4202
03:25:28,190 --> 03:25:29,150
Oh, no.

4203
03:25:29,390 --> 03:25:29,550
Yeah.

4204
03:25:29,570 --> 03:25:30,290
I got all of them dead.

4205
03:25:31,410 --> 03:25:33,070
Yeah, I am so good.

4206
03:25:33,070 --> 03:25:33,150
I'm healing.

4207
03:25:34,530 --> 03:25:35,790
It's just you and John.

4208
03:25:36,010 --> 03:25:36,350
I'm doki.

4209
03:25:38,910 --> 03:25:40,470
I got you with a shield!

4210
03:25:40,770 --> 03:25:41,250
Okay.

4211
03:25:43,110 --> 03:25:44,210
Now we live these.

4212
03:25:44,450 --> 03:25:44,770
I'm so good.

4213
03:25:44,970 --> 03:25:46,190
I have health all of a second.

4214
03:25:46,550 --> 03:25:48,050
I'm so good.

4215
03:25:51,410 --> 03:25:52,350
I'm ulting her.

4216
03:25:53,070 --> 03:25:54,250
Yeah, just hope...

4217
03:25:54,250 --> 03:25:55,890
We have all the tanks alive.

4218
03:25:56,210 --> 03:25:57,150
And Rock is literally healing.

4219
03:25:57,150 --> 03:25:57,770
My shield got shattered instantly.

4220
03:25:59,630 --> 03:26:01,230
I have bubble in six.

4221
03:26:01,350 --> 03:26:03,050
I have all in four percent.

4222
03:26:03,050 --> 03:26:04,170
If you guys can live...

4223
03:26:04,170 --> 03:26:06,510
Guys, point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point.

4224
03:26:07,090 --> 03:26:08,110
I got it, I got it.

4225
03:26:08,110 --> 03:26:08,450
No!

4226
03:26:08,630 --> 03:26:10,990
I got killed by Penny.

4227
03:26:11,470 --> 03:26:12,090
I'm alive!

4228
03:26:13,990 --> 03:26:15,950
I couldn't get in.

4229
03:26:17,370 --> 03:26:19,270
I got killed by Penny.

4230
03:26:20,370 --> 03:26:21,430
Oh, man.

4231
03:26:22,730 --> 03:26:24,050
I think like...

4232
03:26:26,090 --> 03:26:27,670
I don't know.

4233
03:26:27,670 --> 03:26:29,750
Why is it three and seven?

4234
03:26:30,970 --> 03:26:33,170
I think it's because he's drunk.

4235
03:26:34,150 --> 03:26:34,450
No!

4236
03:26:36,090 --> 03:26:37,270
All right, team.

4237
03:26:38,670 --> 03:26:41,410
How many shots have we had tonight?

4238
03:26:42,170 --> 03:26:43,170
I'm going to go low-key.

4239
03:26:43,630 --> 03:26:43,990
I think...

4240
03:26:44,790 --> 03:26:46,850
I don't think Cloak's the answer.

4241
03:26:47,450 --> 03:26:47,990
I don't think...

4242
03:26:49,590 --> 03:26:51,930
I don't think Cloak is the answer.

4243
03:26:53,450 --> 03:26:54,610
He's drunk.

4244
03:26:54,850 --> 03:26:56,290
Oh, no, bro.

4245
03:27:05,730 --> 03:27:07,110
You know what, dude?

4246
03:27:07,410 --> 03:27:10,030
Maybe I should have gotten Captain America when I was on board.

4247
03:27:10,730 --> 03:27:11,910
Maybe that's what went wrong.

4248
03:27:12,070 --> 03:27:12,410
Maybe, yeah.

4249
03:27:12,730 --> 03:27:13,010
Maybe.

4250
03:27:13,690 --> 03:27:14,470
I don't...

4251
03:27:14,470 --> 03:27:16,990
I think we know who to avoid, that's for sure.

4252
03:27:17,890 --> 03:27:21,230
Do we want to let him solo tank and I go DPS?

4253
03:27:21,530 --> 03:27:22,070
We can try.

4254
03:27:22,610 --> 03:27:22,950
Sure.

4255
03:27:25,510 --> 03:27:27,730
At this point, anything can work.

4256
03:27:29,090 --> 03:27:29,810
Like...

4257
03:27:29,810 --> 03:27:31,150
We need...

4258
03:27:31,590 --> 03:27:32,750
We need anything.

4259
03:27:35,290 --> 03:27:37,810
Today the real Degens are playing because it's Christmas.

4260
03:27:38,950 --> 03:27:41,610
They're on Penny and Strange, right?

4261
03:27:41,810 --> 03:27:42,030
Yeah.

4262
03:27:42,450 --> 03:27:44,170
Okay, I'll go Punisher.

4263
03:27:48,650 --> 03:27:52,050
I could go Adam, actually, with this.

4264
03:27:52,490 --> 03:27:52,990
I don't know.

4265
03:27:54,430 --> 03:27:56,710
Oh, their Strange is low already.

4266
03:27:56,710 --> 03:27:58,090
I'm gonna fucking walk.

4267
03:28:01,410 --> 03:28:02,470
Fucking turret.

4268
03:28:08,780 --> 03:28:09,480
Alright.

4269
03:28:10,220 --> 03:28:11,560
We're healing you.

4270
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:13,720
We're healing you so hard.

4271
03:28:14,000 --> 03:28:14,280
Woah.

4272
03:28:14,920 --> 03:28:16,900
We're healing you so hard.

4273
03:28:16,980 --> 03:28:17,980
Oh, their Penny is low.

4274
03:28:18,660 --> 03:28:20,660
We're healing you so hard.

4275
03:28:22,220 --> 03:28:24,540
Oh my god, you are...

4276
03:28:24,540 --> 03:28:25,400
Ah, shit.

4277
03:28:27,080 --> 03:28:28,100
Oh my god.

4278
03:28:28,100 --> 03:28:29,600
Guys, I don't feel too good.

4279
03:28:29,740 --> 03:28:30,580
Oh, fuck.

4280
03:28:30,900 --> 03:28:31,280
It's alright.

4281
03:28:32,100 --> 03:28:33,340
This is not...

4282
03:28:33,340 --> 03:28:35,480
This is just the warm-up game, right?

4283
03:28:35,720 --> 03:28:36,500
No, no, no.

4284
03:28:36,520 --> 03:28:37,440
We're winning this game.

4285
03:28:42,880 --> 03:28:43,240
Okay.

4286
03:28:44,220 --> 03:28:46,160
Okay, I'm shooting him with my clone.

4287
03:28:49,380 --> 03:28:50,020
Turret's gone.

4288
03:28:50,140 --> 03:28:50,580
Punisher's dead.

4289
03:28:50,840 --> 03:28:51,160
Nice.

4290
03:28:51,900 --> 03:28:52,680
He's gonna get revved.

4291
03:28:53,360 --> 03:28:53,720
Yeah.

4292
03:28:56,220 --> 03:28:57,720
I'm reloading my heals.

4293
03:28:57,720 --> 03:28:58,560
Okay.

4294
03:29:00,140 --> 03:29:01,400
I got a little scared.

4295
03:29:05,980 --> 03:29:07,900
I love the Punisher.

4296
03:29:08,200 --> 03:29:09,480
Alright, this is it.

4297
03:29:09,560 --> 03:29:10,160
We just...

4298
03:29:10,160 --> 03:29:10,520
Oh, here.

4299
03:29:10,600 --> 03:29:11,020
I got you.

4300
03:29:12,020 --> 03:29:12,060
Yeah.

4301
03:29:13,880 --> 03:29:14,540
Hey, see?

4302
03:29:14,660 --> 03:29:14,800
Look.

4303
03:29:14,920 --> 03:29:15,400
It's okay.

4304
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:16,380
Everything is okay.

4305
03:29:18,620 --> 03:29:20,360
Everything is so healthy.

4306
03:29:22,400 --> 03:29:23,260
Oh, perfect.

4307
03:29:26,360 --> 03:29:27,380
There's people behind us.

4308
03:29:27,460 --> 03:29:27,700
There's a health pack.

4309
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:28,020
There's people behind us.

4310
03:29:28,020 --> 03:29:28,940
There's people behind us.

4311
03:29:29,060 --> 03:29:29,880
The hell is that?

4312
03:29:29,880 --> 03:29:30,620
That guy's a freak.

4313
03:29:30,940 --> 03:29:32,800
What is that guy doing?

4314
03:29:32,800 --> 03:29:33,500
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

4315
03:29:34,040 --> 03:29:35,020
I don't know.

4316
03:29:36,200 --> 03:29:41,200
Guys, I just realized my mute button is on F, so every time I press F, I fucking switch.

4317
03:29:43,460 --> 03:29:43,940
Wicked.

4318
03:29:44,440 --> 03:29:44,760
Yeah.

4319
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:45,700
Whoops.

4320
03:29:50,420 --> 03:29:52,840
SuperFishy9000 is eating shit right now.

4321
03:29:54,040 --> 03:29:54,580
Penny's one.

4322
03:29:55,400 --> 03:29:56,280
I am healing.

4323
03:29:56,580 --> 03:29:57,260
I am healing.

4324
03:29:57,980 --> 03:30:01,260
I'm gonna clone you and then see what happens.

4325
03:30:03,060 --> 03:30:04,240
I'm gonna peel one.

4326
03:30:04,440 --> 03:30:04,600
Okay.

4327
03:30:05,140 --> 03:30:05,800
Hold on there.

4328
03:30:06,100 --> 03:30:06,600
Alright.

4329
03:30:07,340 --> 03:30:08,400
I'm hella now.

4330
03:30:09,300 --> 03:30:10,340
Yeah, hella no bird.

4331
03:30:10,420 --> 03:30:11,500
I'm hella now.

4332
03:30:12,840 --> 03:30:14,060
Oh my god, that's crazy.

4333
03:30:14,060 --> 03:30:18,660
It's gonna be so funny because they're gonna be like, wait, why do we have another hella?

4334
03:30:21,140 --> 03:30:24,300
Dude, she almost shit on me, bro.

4335
03:30:24,300 --> 03:30:26,440
Battlefield ready again.

4336
03:30:26,760 --> 03:30:28,760
Alright, MS3 on part.

4337
03:30:30,520 --> 03:30:33,160
They are not taking this high ground.

4338
03:30:34,060 --> 03:30:35,360
They're TPing, they're TPing.

4339
03:30:35,580 --> 03:30:36,640
Oh, they're TPing, nevermind.

4340
03:30:40,220 --> 03:30:41,080
I'm ulting.

4341
03:30:44,460 --> 03:30:45,620
I have...

4342
03:30:45,620 --> 03:30:46,420
I killed the Punisher.

4343
03:30:47,620 --> 03:30:48,200
No!

4344
03:30:48,800 --> 03:30:50,180
I got killed by their hella.

4345
03:30:50,700 --> 03:30:53,580
Oh, their Penny and their Cloak are low behind us.

4346
03:30:53,580 --> 03:30:56,640
Yeah, but we lost both supports.

4347
03:31:00,020 --> 03:31:02,020
Yeah, they just had...

4348
03:31:02,020 --> 03:31:03,160
Wait, I misclicked.

4349
03:31:03,280 --> 03:31:03,920
What did he do?

4350
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:05,520
He...

4351
03:31:05,520 --> 03:31:06,560
I think he ulted.

4352
03:31:07,420 --> 03:31:08,460
Did he ulted?

4353
03:31:08,640 --> 03:31:09,500
Oh, it's fine.

4354
03:31:10,060 --> 03:31:10,240
It's fine.

4355
03:31:10,240 --> 03:31:11,980
He's just a silly little guy.

4356
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:14,200
Maybe they'll shoot this guy.

4357
03:31:15,040 --> 03:31:16,040
They shot him.

4358
03:31:16,720 --> 03:31:18,260
Oh, their hella is just chilling top right.

4359
03:31:21,420 --> 03:31:21,900
Ow.

4360
03:31:21,900 --> 03:31:23,200
Oh, they have a Bucky now too.

4361
03:31:23,400 --> 03:31:25,460
The Bucky is running it down.

4362
03:31:26,800 --> 03:31:27,300
It's fine.

4363
03:31:28,880 --> 03:31:30,900
So is our Strange, but that's okay.

4364
03:31:34,040 --> 03:31:36,100
Their Cloak and hella are playing together up top.

4365
03:31:36,380 --> 03:31:38,180
Oh my god, that guy...

4366
03:31:38,680 --> 03:31:39,340
There we go.

4367
03:31:39,980 --> 03:31:42,240
There we go, I kept our Strange alive.

4368
03:31:42,620 --> 03:31:43,100
Surprisingly.

4369
03:31:43,400 --> 03:31:45,200
I'm pushing the hella top right.

4370
03:31:45,280 --> 03:31:45,820
Oh my gosh.

4371
03:31:45,820 --> 03:31:46,440
Hella one, hella one.

4372
03:31:48,540 --> 03:31:49,460
Hella dead, hella dead.

4373
03:31:52,780 --> 03:31:53,320
Strange!

4374
03:31:54,660 --> 03:31:55,920
Guys, we lost one.

4375
03:31:56,100 --> 03:31:56,320
I'm solo.

4376
03:31:58,180 --> 03:31:59,180
I can't.

4377
03:31:59,380 --> 03:32:00,060
I can't.

4378
03:32:00,160 --> 03:32:02,440
I literally used all my resources on the stage.

4379
03:32:04,140 --> 03:32:04,880
You are...

4380
03:32:04,880 --> 03:32:07,340
You're gonna be solo healing for a little bit until our Raccoon comes back.

4381
03:32:07,360 --> 03:32:08,660
The HTC!

4382
03:32:10,020 --> 03:32:12,740
What is wrong with my Qs?

4383
03:32:14,960 --> 03:32:16,780
What the fuck, man?

4384
03:32:18,940 --> 03:32:19,480
Why?

4385
03:32:20,300 --> 03:32:20,960
It's okay.

4386
03:32:20,960 --> 03:32:22,000
I'm okay.

4387
03:32:23,670 --> 03:32:25,320
This is fine.

4388
03:32:25,560 --> 03:32:26,780
Their Bucky's one.

4389
03:32:27,160 --> 03:32:27,300
Dead.

4390
03:32:27,800 --> 03:32:28,680
Thank you.

4391
03:32:30,180 --> 03:32:31,520
Everything is fine.

4392
03:32:31,680 --> 03:32:33,800
I have ult soon and then I'm gonna copy hella.

4393
03:32:36,300 --> 03:32:37,520
Oh, he's back!

4394
03:32:40,340 --> 03:32:42,020
I feel so safe.

4395
03:32:43,100 --> 03:32:44,340
Okay, where are you?

4396
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:46,360
Hella's one bottom left.

4397
03:32:48,380 --> 03:32:48,920
She ulted.

4398
03:32:50,520 --> 03:32:51,720
Okay, this is the...

4399
03:32:51,720 --> 03:32:52,540
It's a very bad ult.

4400
03:32:56,040 --> 03:32:56,540
Unless...

4401
03:32:56,540 --> 03:32:56,940
It's fine.

4402
03:32:57,040 --> 03:32:57,500
They all...

4403
03:32:57,500 --> 03:33:00,060
They rocket Raccoon just as I wanted to.

4404
03:33:00,140 --> 03:33:03,340
I wanted them to rocket Raccoon anyway.

4405
03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:07,180
Their Bucky's low.

4406
03:33:08,220 --> 03:33:08,720
Okay.

4407
03:33:10,120 --> 03:33:10,840
We're fine.

4408
03:33:10,900 --> 03:33:11,180
We're fine.

4409
03:33:11,240 --> 03:33:12,180
We have...

4410
03:33:12,840 --> 03:33:13,600
We're fine.

4411
03:33:13,720 --> 03:33:13,900
See?

4412
03:33:14,380 --> 03:33:15,020
We're so fine.

4413
03:33:15,920 --> 03:33:16,620
Penny dead.

4414
03:33:20,680 --> 03:33:21,940
We're so okay.

4415
03:33:22,140 --> 03:33:23,240
We're so talented.

4416
03:33:24,180 --> 03:33:24,540
See?

4417
03:33:24,700 --> 03:33:28,080
That's how you know we're gonna win this game because we had a DC and we still won that point.

4418
03:33:28,440 --> 03:33:30,060
No, he came back when we won the point.

4419
03:33:30,220 --> 03:33:31,860
He came back when we won the point.

4420
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:33,740
He came back when we won the point.

4421
03:33:33,920 --> 03:33:34,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

4422
03:33:35,500 --> 03:33:37,980
He didn't DC at all and us winning that?

4423
03:33:38,060 --> 03:33:38,920
We're winning this game.

4424
03:33:40,200 --> 03:33:41,180
Also, I might be dead.

4425
03:33:41,560 --> 03:33:41,940
No, you're fine.

4426
03:33:42,020 --> 03:33:42,380
You're fine.

4427
03:33:42,980 --> 03:33:44,080
I'm healing you guys.

4428
03:33:45,320 --> 03:33:46,780
Yeah, I think Lowkey was the play here.

4429
03:33:53,490 --> 03:33:54,370
I'm keeping you up.

4430
03:33:55,550 --> 03:33:56,390
Depending on that.

4431
03:33:57,630 --> 03:33:58,330
Oh my god!

4432
03:33:58,490 --> 03:33:59,670
Go, Jon Power!

4433
03:33:59,910 --> 03:34:00,250
Go!

4434
03:34:01,050 --> 03:34:01,770
He's dead.

4435
03:34:02,910 --> 03:34:04,030
No, Jon.

4436
03:34:04,330 --> 03:34:06,210
He's dead.

4437
03:34:06,850 --> 03:34:08,470
But it was so cool, Zoe.

4438
03:34:09,270 --> 03:34:11,250
Oh, I cancelled his ult with my fucking E.

4439
03:34:11,530 --> 03:34:11,730
Nice.

4440
03:34:11,730 --> 03:34:12,390
I didn't know I could do that.

4441
03:34:12,770 --> 03:34:14,250
I put up a...

4442
03:34:17,210 --> 03:34:18,510
I got close, I got close.

4443
03:34:18,530 --> 03:34:18,830
Okay, I'm ulting.

4444
03:34:18,990 --> 03:34:19,730
I have to...

4445
03:34:21,470 --> 03:34:21,950
Oh!

4446
03:34:22,510 --> 03:34:22,830
Strange is one!

4447
03:34:23,010 --> 03:34:23,870
Strange is so low!

4448
03:34:24,110 --> 03:34:24,690
Hello, dad.

4449
03:34:25,210 --> 03:34:27,410
Oh my god, Strange was actually so low.

4450
03:34:29,590 --> 03:34:30,430
I'm on HP.

4451
03:34:30,610 --> 03:34:31,030
Do you have your Deku?

4452
03:34:31,270 --> 03:34:31,890
Oh, yep.

4453
03:34:31,890 --> 03:34:32,390
I got you.

4454
03:34:33,630 --> 03:34:34,010
Penny does.

4455
03:34:34,090 --> 03:34:34,450
Penny does.

4456
03:34:34,730 --> 03:34:35,090
Nice.

4457
03:34:35,870 --> 03:34:36,410
Strange above.

4458
03:34:36,570 --> 03:34:37,010
Strange left.

4459
03:34:37,370 --> 03:34:37,470
Jon Power!

4460
03:34:38,150 --> 03:34:40,310
You're gonna be okay, Jon Power!

4461
03:34:42,770 --> 03:34:45,450
It's okay, he didn't hit that, but it's okay.

4462
03:34:45,970 --> 03:34:48,930
And then I have my invincibility here.

4463
03:34:50,390 --> 03:34:51,950
I'm trying to focus Hello.

4464
03:34:52,590 --> 03:34:53,850
Oh my god, please!

4465
03:34:54,050 --> 03:34:54,450
Get me off!

4466
03:34:54,550 --> 03:34:55,010
Oh no!

4467
03:34:55,030 --> 03:34:55,470
No!

4468
03:34:55,750 --> 03:34:57,130
I thought that was the smart...

4469
03:34:57,130 --> 03:35:00,010
I literally whaled on point and I thought that was so smart.

4470
03:35:00,870 --> 03:35:01,310
Fuck.

4471
03:35:02,390 --> 03:35:03,450
Oh, he got killed!

4472
03:35:04,730 --> 03:35:05,170
No.

4473
03:35:05,610 --> 03:35:07,650
But I still died because you got killed.

4474
03:35:08,670 --> 03:35:09,050
Dude.

4475
03:35:09,090 --> 03:35:11,250
All I did was stagger you by carrying that guy.

4476
03:35:11,350 --> 03:35:11,790
He had me!

4477
03:35:12,790 --> 03:35:15,030
I staggered me because of it!

4478
03:35:15,610 --> 03:35:17,450
Why did you have to get a kill?

4479
03:35:18,630 --> 03:35:23,110
Dude, I ulted that and got the hell out of ult and that's it.

4480
03:35:23,170 --> 03:35:23,970
I'm so sad.

4481
03:35:24,270 --> 03:35:26,230
I did the whale, but then the strange...

4482
03:35:26,230 --> 03:35:29,550
I did the whale on the point and the strange blocked the whale.

4483
03:35:29,910 --> 03:35:33,850
Uh-oh.

4484
03:35:36,320 --> 03:35:36,820
Goodbye, world.

4485
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:39,060
I had my...

4486
03:35:39,060 --> 03:35:39,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4487
03:35:39,800 --> 03:35:40,620
I clutched that.

4488
03:35:41,240 --> 03:35:41,760
We have to go, though.

4489
03:35:41,780 --> 03:35:42,360
We have to go.

4490
03:35:42,700 --> 03:35:43,300
Run, I'm dead.

4491
03:35:43,380 --> 03:35:43,860
They have no tanks.

4492
03:35:45,400 --> 03:35:46,060
They're at him chasing.

4493
03:35:46,420 --> 03:35:47,240
Not the fish!

4494
03:35:47,560 --> 03:35:50,260
The fish one-tap me from below!

4495
03:35:50,380 --> 03:35:52,240
The cloak is low behind!

4496
03:35:54,180 --> 03:35:54,780
No!

4497
03:35:55,940 --> 03:35:57,260
It's not us.

4498
03:35:57,440 --> 03:35:58,960
I don't think it was us.

4499
03:35:59,140 --> 03:36:00,820
I don't think we were the problem.

4500
03:36:00,940 --> 03:36:01,680
It was oppressing tab.

4501
03:36:01,820 --> 03:36:03,120
That shit was not us.

4502
03:36:03,360 --> 03:36:04,360
That was not...

4503
03:36:04,360 --> 03:36:05,940
Alright, who were we avoiding?

4504
03:36:06,400 --> 03:36:08,860
We were actually gaming there.

4505
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:11,600
Like, all three of us actually played our part.

4506
03:36:12,020 --> 03:36:14,740
We all played our part in this.

4507
03:36:15,020 --> 03:36:15,560
I was...

4508
03:36:15,560 --> 03:36:21,900
Dude, I was tank for the first half of the game, and Jon Powers just not cutting it, bro.

4509
03:36:22,500 --> 03:36:24,060
He got picked, at least.

4510
03:36:24,200 --> 03:36:25,480
Just not when it matters.

4511
03:36:26,140 --> 03:36:26,320
No.

4512
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:30,260
That was a warm-up game.

4513
03:36:30,300 --> 03:36:30,780
I just got on.

4514
03:36:31,080 --> 03:36:32,060
Yeah, that's true.

4515
03:36:32,440 --> 03:36:32,960
That's true.

4516
03:36:35,080 --> 03:36:37,100
Guys, I don't mind being Diamond 1 again.

4517
03:36:37,320 --> 03:36:38,480
It's fun down there.

4518
03:36:38,500 --> 03:36:40,260
I am negative 11...

4519
03:36:40,260 --> 03:36:40,700
No, no, no.

4520
03:36:40,700 --> 03:36:42,660
I'm negative 11 into GM3.

4521
03:36:42,880 --> 03:36:44,480
We are not losing this game.

4522
03:36:44,480 --> 03:36:45,460
I'm avoiding.

4523
03:36:45,720 --> 03:36:45,860
I'm avoiding.

4524
03:36:45,860 --> 03:36:46,200
I'm drunk.

4525
03:36:46,220 --> 03:36:47,160
I'm avoiding.

4526
03:36:47,380 --> 03:36:48,140
I'm drunk.

4527
03:36:48,240 --> 03:36:50,160
Why would you avoid the guy named...

4528
03:36:50,160 --> 03:36:51,240
I'm drunk, dude.

4529
03:36:51,280 --> 03:36:55,080
You have Void down, kid.

4530
03:36:58,380 --> 03:37:00,820
Liz, he was...

4531
03:37:00,820 --> 03:37:01,640
They were popping off.

4532
03:37:01,660 --> 03:37:05,780
Maybe I should have stayed on Magneto so I could keep bubbling him to prevent him from inting.

4533
03:37:06,460 --> 03:37:07,840
I think that's...

4534
03:37:07,840 --> 03:37:10,120
I think you actually clutched it with that, too.

4535
03:37:11,020 --> 03:37:11,500
Fuck.

4536
03:37:13,120 --> 03:37:13,660
That was fun.

4537
03:37:14,720 --> 03:37:15,900
Please don't ban Psylocke.

4538
03:37:15,900 --> 03:37:17,080
I'm going to shit my pants.

4539
03:37:17,500 --> 03:37:18,260
It's fine.

4540
03:37:19,520 --> 03:37:20,900
Who are we banning first?

4541
03:37:21,420 --> 03:37:21,800
Hawkeye.

4542
03:37:22,040 --> 03:37:22,980
Don't fucking...

4543
03:37:22,980 --> 03:37:23,920
I don't want to play...

4544
03:37:23,920 --> 03:37:24,520
I don't care.

4545
03:37:24,600 --> 03:37:27,600
I don't care if they ban Hawkeye as long as I don't have to play against Hawkeye.

4546
03:37:27,680 --> 03:37:28,000
It's fine.

4547
03:37:28,520 --> 03:37:28,680
True.

4548
03:37:29,200 --> 03:37:31,900
I like how I accidentally picked Hawkeye, but that's...

4549
03:37:32,580 --> 03:37:34,720
Like, my character select is on Hawkeye.

4550
03:37:36,080 --> 03:37:36,460
Okay.

4551
03:37:37,460 --> 03:37:38,960
We can come back from this.

4552
03:37:39,400 --> 03:37:39,960
Oh, no.

4553
03:37:40,100 --> 03:37:41,280
We do come back from this.

4554
03:37:41,300 --> 03:37:42,280
We can come back from this.

4555
03:37:43,200 --> 03:37:45,380
I don't want to know what it's like to be GM2 again.

4556
03:37:47,260 --> 03:37:47,620
Okay.

4557
03:37:47,700 --> 03:37:48,380
Now we ban Hela.

4558
03:37:48,480 --> 03:37:49,900
There's no chance I'm playing against Hela.

4559
03:37:50,060 --> 03:37:50,520
I just don't want to do that.

4560
03:37:50,520 --> 03:37:51,420
Why did they ban Psylocke?

4561
03:37:52,840 --> 03:37:54,180
I'm going to shit my pants.

4562
03:37:54,240 --> 03:37:55,020
Why did they ban Psylocke?

4563
03:37:55,680 --> 03:37:57,720
I don't want them to ban Psylocke.

4564
03:37:57,880 --> 03:38:00,780
Every time I play with a Psylocke main, their Psylocke gets banned.

4565
03:38:01,300 --> 03:38:02,340
No matter what I do.

4566
03:38:02,340 --> 03:38:04,180
Dude, how are they supposed to know that...

4567
03:38:04,180 --> 03:38:04,720
They don't know.

4568
03:38:04,720 --> 03:38:05,720
How are they supposed to know that I'm a Psylocke player?

4569
03:38:05,740 --> 03:38:05,900
That's the thing.

4570
03:38:05,960 --> 03:38:06,540
They don't know.

4571
03:38:07,060 --> 03:38:08,860
Dude, I'm going to get that Moon Knight banner.

4572
03:38:09,200 --> 03:38:13,960
Everyone's going to start banning Moon Knight because they're like, Oh, this guy, he's a Moon Knight player.

4573
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:14,880
We got to ban his Moon Knight.

4574
03:38:14,880 --> 03:38:16,720
And then I get Psylocke every game.

4575
03:38:18,740 --> 03:38:18,980
See?

4576
03:38:19,440 --> 03:38:19,740
It worked.

4577
03:38:20,320 --> 03:38:21,460
That's why they didn't ban Psylocke.

4578
03:38:21,660 --> 03:38:23,080
I didn't have my Psylocke banner equipped.

4579
03:38:24,080 --> 03:38:24,680
I'm a genius.

4580
03:38:26,540 --> 03:38:31,040
There's always a gamble between Luna or Mantis or Psylocke.

4581
03:38:32,820 --> 03:38:35,900
I want to say, I don't mind Mantis, but Luna...

4582
03:38:35,900 --> 03:38:39,140
She stays in ult for 12 seconds!

4583
03:38:40,460 --> 03:38:40,980
12!

4584
03:38:40,980 --> 03:38:41,300
12!

4585
03:38:44,220 --> 03:38:45,640
Sucks to be you, I guess.

4586
03:38:45,740 --> 03:38:47,020
Sucks to be you, I guess.

4587
03:38:49,760 --> 03:38:53,240
She just busts it down for so long.

4588
03:38:53,360 --> 03:38:54,320
It's so annoying.

4589
03:38:55,280 --> 03:38:56,260
Sucks to suck.

4590
03:38:58,020 --> 03:38:59,680
Alright, how's the volume, by the way?

4591
03:38:59,740 --> 03:39:00,900
Oh my god, I'm so happy.

4592
03:39:01,020 --> 03:39:01,480
No empathy?

4593
03:39:01,920 --> 03:39:05,360
Guys, I'm down like five games.

4594
03:39:05,520 --> 03:39:07,900
Like, I have zero empathy right now.

4595
03:39:12,360 --> 03:39:14,480
I need five games to even recover.

4596
03:39:14,980 --> 03:39:16,480
By fucking you, though.

4597
03:39:18,300 --> 03:39:18,780
For a roof?

4598
03:39:18,880 --> 03:39:19,420
Okay, okay.

4599
03:39:19,560 --> 03:39:20,000
That's good.

4600
03:39:20,180 --> 03:39:23,940
Oh my god, Mac, back on the magic?

4601
03:39:25,540 --> 03:39:27,500
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

4602
03:39:28,260 --> 03:39:32,140
Magic's not even your best character, what the fuck are you talking about?

4603
03:39:33,020 --> 03:39:35,480
It's not even your best character!

4604
03:39:36,680 --> 03:39:37,720
We're portaling, by the way.

4605
03:39:38,160 --> 03:39:40,740
By the way, my two DPS players are not memes.

4606
03:39:43,060 --> 03:39:45,720
No, dude, I'm taking an off angle, you don't get it.

4607
03:39:45,720 --> 03:39:46,900
You don't fuck with the vision.

4608
03:39:47,520 --> 03:39:48,300
I froze the Hulk.

4609
03:39:48,680 --> 03:39:49,240
Where are they?

4610
03:39:49,700 --> 03:39:50,540
Hulk is one.

4611
03:39:51,740 --> 03:39:54,140
Oh, I need help.

4612
03:39:55,660 --> 03:39:57,700
Oh, I need so much help.

4613
03:39:58,040 --> 03:39:59,080
Oh, no way.

4614
03:39:59,360 --> 03:40:00,520
There's no way.

4615
03:40:01,700 --> 03:40:04,920
Guys, we cannot lose to Nutsack Jones.

4616
03:40:05,600 --> 03:40:09,360
All I'm seeing is that...

4617
03:40:10,180 --> 03:40:12,640
My DPS players did not take the portal.

4618
03:40:13,920 --> 03:40:15,240
I'm taking an off angle.

4619
03:40:16,680 --> 03:40:17,660
I'm taking my portal!

4620
03:40:19,420 --> 03:40:20,700
Is this a West Coast server?

4621
03:40:21,380 --> 03:40:23,140
It is, I have 130 ping.

4622
03:40:23,600 --> 03:40:26,600
I have 67 ping, I am West Coast!

4623
03:40:28,800 --> 03:40:31,120
To be fair, the server routing here is not great.

4624
03:40:31,840 --> 03:40:32,100
Yeah.

4625
03:40:33,400 --> 03:40:36,240
Let me know when you're ready to engage and I'll hop on over.

4626
03:40:37,440 --> 03:40:38,360
Yeah, I'm here.

4627
03:40:38,360 --> 03:40:40,240
I usually just help pressure tanks.

4628
03:40:40,520 --> 03:40:41,380
Black Panther!

4629
03:40:41,520 --> 03:40:41,980
Black Panther!

4630
03:40:45,340 --> 03:40:47,800
I'm just beating the Panther's ass, or trying to.

4631
03:40:48,540 --> 03:40:50,300
I can't.

4632
03:40:55,040 --> 03:40:56,620
Oh, my God.

4633
03:40:59,520 --> 03:41:01,780
I cannot keep him up.

4634
03:41:02,400 --> 03:41:03,720
I have to ult, too.

4635
03:41:03,920 --> 03:41:05,680
We had to ult in the backline.

4636
03:41:07,360 --> 03:41:09,420
We had Nutsack who would die.

4637
03:41:12,420 --> 03:41:13,990
Nutsack Jones can die.

4638
03:41:14,980 --> 03:41:15,640
Can he?

4639
03:41:16,660 --> 03:41:17,320
Maybe.

4640
03:41:17,800 --> 03:41:20,560
We have no support ults, by the way.

4641
03:41:20,640 --> 03:41:22,740
I have Panther and Hulk on me.

4642
03:41:23,200 --> 03:41:24,900
I just have Panther.

4643
03:41:25,180 --> 03:41:27,500
I'm going low-key, fuck this.

4644
03:41:27,700 --> 03:41:28,080
I can't.

4645
03:41:29,300 --> 03:41:30,960
My other support doesn't help me.

4646
03:41:32,340 --> 03:41:33,580
Yo, kill the Hulk.

4647
03:41:34,840 --> 03:41:37,340
This guy is just a wall of meat, bro.

4648
03:41:38,220 --> 03:41:40,560
I'm going to do one more death and I swear to God...

4649
03:41:40,560 --> 03:41:41,940
No, you are not Ayagamoto-ing me.

4650
03:41:42,360 --> 03:41:45,220
If they don't support me, I'm going low-key.

4651
03:41:48,680 --> 03:41:49,560
I'm ulting her.

4652
03:41:50,080 --> 03:41:51,620
Oh, help her.

4653
03:41:52,260 --> 03:41:52,940
Help her fucking swing.

4654
03:41:53,080 --> 03:41:54,380
Magic's gotta die.

4655
03:41:56,480 --> 03:41:58,400
I swear to God, I am helping her.

4656
03:41:58,660 --> 03:41:59,300
I help her, guy.

4657
03:41:59,880 --> 03:42:00,920
There we go.

4658
03:42:02,180 --> 03:42:02,940
I did the thing.

4659
03:42:02,940 --> 03:42:09,200
Guys, I hate playing with a support partner that doesn't fucking peel.

4660
03:42:11,460 --> 03:42:15,500
At the moment, my support partner doesn't peel for me, I go low-key.

4661
03:42:15,640 --> 03:42:16,960
Because that's the only way to survive.

4662
03:42:17,800 --> 03:42:20,240
It's literally the only way you can live.

4663
03:42:21,940 --> 03:42:22,960
Like, I can't.

4664
03:42:23,040 --> 03:42:24,760
I legitimately cannot deal with that shit.

4665
03:42:26,560 --> 03:42:29,660
I don't get covered, nobody... I'm not playing.

4666
03:42:30,160 --> 03:42:32,600
I'd rather be a character that can survive.

4667
03:42:35,020 --> 03:42:36,860
I guess I go for it.

4668
03:42:37,280 --> 03:42:38,160
Change is low.

4669
03:42:39,740 --> 03:42:41,320
Oh, have point, but we're one away.

4670
03:42:43,520 --> 03:42:44,660
I'm on point, I'm on point.

4671
03:42:45,560 --> 03:42:46,400
It's Black Panther.

4672
03:42:46,800 --> 03:42:49,100
I'm gonna die because I sacrificed myself to be here.

4673
03:42:50,500 --> 03:42:52,160
Okay, Black Panther on point.

4674
03:42:52,940 --> 03:42:54,020
He's like actually one.

4675
03:42:54,700 --> 03:42:55,640
He's about to fight, yeah.

4676
03:42:57,960 --> 03:42:59,020
What the fuck?

4677
03:42:59,120 --> 03:43:00,540
Okay, what is this guy doing?

4678
03:43:00,780 --> 03:43:01,520
I hate this.

4679
03:43:03,640 --> 03:43:04,880
Nice, that's a good sentence.

4680
03:43:04,980 --> 03:43:07,840
Oh my god, the things I do to help my team.

4681
03:43:07,840 --> 03:43:08,440
They have Lunal, right?

4682
03:43:10,160 --> 03:43:11,200
They do, they do.

4683
03:43:11,400 --> 03:43:12,580
I'm gonna see if I can force it.

4684
03:43:17,150 --> 03:43:18,510
Here comes the pain.

4685
03:43:19,090 --> 03:43:21,010
If you force Lunal, you're the goat.

4686
03:43:21,690 --> 03:43:22,510
I don't think I can.

4687
03:43:23,090 --> 03:43:23,830
I have to do this.

4688
03:43:24,510 --> 03:43:27,290
Oh my god, you exploded.

4689
03:43:29,230 --> 03:43:30,350
Oh, I got my one.

4690
03:43:30,490 --> 03:43:30,890
You all exploded.

4691
03:43:30,890 --> 03:43:30,930
You exploded.

4692
03:43:37,770 --> 03:43:38,810
I'm backing...

4693
03:43:38,810 --> 03:43:43,690
I don't know how he lived, but I don't think I'm gonna live.

4694
03:43:45,390 --> 03:43:46,770
I definitely don't live.

4695
03:43:46,930 --> 03:43:47,970
I definitely don't live.

4696
03:43:48,110 --> 03:43:49,310
I definitely...

4697
03:43:49,310 --> 03:43:50,110
Oh, I live.

4698
03:43:51,070 --> 03:43:52,210
Oh, there's Black Panther's one.

4699
03:43:53,150 --> 03:43:53,810
That's a huge ult.

4700
03:43:55,210 --> 03:43:55,630
Please!

4701
03:43:56,270 --> 03:43:57,770
Oh, this is even more huge.

4702
03:43:59,870 --> 03:44:01,210
I'm gonna pop my ult here.

4703
03:44:01,430 --> 03:44:03,770
I don't know, I don't think you should.

4704
03:44:07,570 --> 03:44:08,330
Nah, it's a good ult.

4705
03:44:08,690 --> 03:44:09,110
Oh, is it?

4706
03:44:09,170 --> 03:44:09,790
Nice, okay.

4707
03:44:11,130 --> 03:44:12,150
Magic slow, magic slow.

4708
03:44:12,410 --> 03:44:12,750
Magic slow.

4709
03:44:13,010 --> 03:44:13,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4710
03:44:14,530 --> 03:44:15,790
Oh, Hulk's lunging my meat.

4711
03:44:15,950 --> 03:44:16,750
Get him off of me, bro.

4712
03:44:20,210 --> 03:44:21,870
I get my ult pretty quick, so it's fine.

4713
03:44:21,990 --> 03:44:22,770
Okay, that's good.

4714
03:44:23,870 --> 03:44:24,190
Nice.

4715
03:44:25,150 --> 03:44:25,910
It's just that easy.

4716
03:44:26,990 --> 03:44:28,790
Honestly, me dying is alright, then.

4717
03:44:30,470 --> 03:44:33,150
I can have three people on me at all times.

4718
03:44:34,710 --> 03:44:35,550
But it's okay.

4719
03:44:35,950 --> 03:44:38,650
Because everybody is on me, so you guys can kill the backline.

4720
03:44:40,170 --> 03:44:41,490
I don't need to be alive.

4721
03:44:42,230 --> 03:44:45,070
It's so nice they used Luna ult at the end.

4722
03:44:45,390 --> 03:44:46,010
Oh, man.

4723
03:44:46,750 --> 03:44:49,030
Guys, I don't need to be alive.

4724
03:44:49,070 --> 03:44:51,870
Guys, I don't need to be alive.

4725
03:44:52,510 --> 03:44:54,030
This is so free.

4726
03:44:54,270 --> 03:44:57,710
I stand near the cloak, I die.

4727
03:44:58,250 --> 03:45:00,470
I position myself away, I die.

4728
03:45:00,630 --> 03:45:01,470
There's no winning.

4729
03:45:01,810 --> 03:45:02,870
I just die.

4730
03:45:04,030 --> 03:45:07,190
I don't know where to position myself in a way where I don't die.

4731
03:45:07,210 --> 03:45:10,010
They have Caitlyn backline for the first minute of the game.

4732
03:45:10,110 --> 03:45:12,630
Yeah, just being an absolute little bastard.

4733
03:45:13,230 --> 03:45:14,430
Just terrorizing their supports.

4734
03:45:14,690 --> 03:45:15,390
For the greater good!

4735
03:45:16,170 --> 03:45:22,390
After we portaled and we lost the teamfight and I didn't take the portal, I was just like standing there.

4736
03:45:22,970 --> 03:45:27,170
I wasn't even shooting them because I couldn't engage on them.

4737
03:45:27,270 --> 03:45:28,870
You just watched us die like that?

4738
03:45:28,970 --> 03:45:29,130
That's fucked.

4739
03:45:29,130 --> 03:45:31,070
I just watched you guys die.

4740
03:45:31,910 --> 03:45:33,730
I'm playing for Kaydee, fuck you guys.

4741
03:45:34,190 --> 03:45:36,270
I wish I could play for Kaydee.

4742
03:45:37,950 --> 03:45:39,630
Oh, fuck, he's right there.

4743
03:45:42,110 --> 03:45:43,810
Hey guys, there's a Black Panther.

4744
03:45:45,770 --> 03:45:46,870
Panther's breaking my neck.

4745
03:45:46,970 --> 03:45:47,790
Don't know where he was.

4746
03:45:52,110 --> 03:45:54,050
That's a lot of dead people.

4747
03:45:56,010 --> 03:45:56,850
Panther's one health.

4748
03:45:57,130 --> 03:45:58,510
Wait, do we win this?

4749
03:45:58,990 --> 03:45:59,190
Yeah.

4750
03:45:59,710 --> 03:46:01,550
Okay, there's a Black Panther.

4751
03:46:01,690 --> 03:46:02,610
I don't think we win this.

4752
03:46:03,350 --> 03:46:04,910
I think I died to this guy.

4753
03:46:04,930 --> 03:46:05,770
Nah, I'm him though.

4754
03:46:09,130 --> 03:46:09,870
I'm fine.

4755
03:46:10,110 --> 03:46:11,210
There's a Black Panther behind us.

4756
03:46:11,230 --> 03:46:11,530
I got Panther.

4757
03:46:12,010 --> 03:46:12,710
Thank you.

4758
03:46:15,390 --> 03:46:17,550
Oh, their Nutsack Jones is low.

4759
03:46:17,670 --> 03:46:18,430
I forgot his name.

4760
03:46:18,710 --> 03:46:19,290
Stalker's range.

4761
03:46:19,390 --> 03:46:19,810
There we go.

4762
03:46:21,450 --> 03:46:22,210
We have one.

4763
03:46:22,350 --> 03:46:22,710
We're down.

4764
03:46:22,890 --> 03:46:23,630
We're up one.

4765
03:46:23,950 --> 03:46:24,990
Never mind, we're even.

4766
03:46:25,030 --> 03:46:26,310
I just ran it down.

4767
03:46:27,290 --> 03:46:30,210
You know, when I say we're up one, I didn't think you would do that.

4768
03:46:33,030 --> 03:46:33,830
Oopsie daisies.

4769
03:46:34,370 --> 03:46:35,010
My bad.

4770
03:46:35,610 --> 03:46:36,030
Hulk is one.

4771
03:46:36,070 --> 03:46:36,410
Hulk is low.

4772
03:46:36,470 --> 03:46:36,890
Hulk is low.

4773
03:46:37,290 --> 03:46:38,730
Psylocke is one HP on health.

4774
03:46:39,350 --> 03:46:40,350
Hulk is low too.

4775
03:46:41,890 --> 03:46:42,570
I'm coming back.

4776
03:46:43,410 --> 03:46:45,830
Um, I have fucking Panther on me.

4777
03:46:46,710 --> 03:46:47,670
I'm sorry.

4778
03:46:47,830 --> 03:46:49,410
I'm so sorry, Cloak.

4779
03:46:49,570 --> 03:46:50,370
Please, Cloak.

4780
03:46:50,390 --> 03:46:51,790
Oh, he's so low.

4781
03:46:53,170 --> 03:46:54,370
I'm gonna ult this.

4782
03:46:55,110 --> 03:46:55,490
I'm ulting.

4783
03:46:56,290 --> 03:46:57,110
I like this ult.

4784
03:47:00,270 --> 03:47:01,490
Um, it runs.

4785
03:47:01,850 --> 03:47:02,610
Oh my god.

4786
03:47:04,590 --> 03:47:05,230
I'm backing out.

4787
03:47:05,330 --> 03:47:05,810
I'm backing out.

4788
03:47:06,390 --> 03:47:07,250
My thing's over.

4789
03:47:07,710 --> 03:47:08,790
I'm trying to get Hulk off here.

4790
03:47:10,130 --> 03:47:12,110
Oh, he's so low once he finishes ulting.

4791
03:47:12,110 --> 03:47:13,010
Hulk is off.

4792
03:47:15,510 --> 03:47:16,330
Support's coming back.

4793
03:47:16,390 --> 03:47:17,250
You guys can contest point.

4794
03:47:18,590 --> 03:47:19,290
Yeah, I'm engaging.

4795
03:47:20,730 --> 03:47:21,090
Okay.

4796
03:47:22,010 --> 03:47:23,410
I'm trying to help right now.

4797
03:47:23,890 --> 03:47:24,250
Hulk one.

4798
03:47:24,330 --> 03:47:24,790
Hulk one.

4799
03:47:25,370 --> 03:47:26,090
I got Hulk off.

4800
03:47:27,810 --> 03:47:28,390
I'm killing both of them.

4801
03:47:28,870 --> 03:47:30,290
No, we have to flip the point back.

4802
03:47:31,430 --> 03:47:31,790
Okay.

4803
03:47:31,790 --> 03:47:32,470
That's a good fight.

4804
03:47:33,310 --> 03:47:34,490
I hate playing against this team.

4805
03:47:34,490 --> 03:47:35,230
I don't hate my team.

4806
03:47:35,650 --> 03:47:36,270
I hate playing.

4807
03:47:36,690 --> 03:47:37,490
They used Cloak.

4808
03:47:37,570 --> 03:47:39,210
I don't know if they used Cloak, actually.

4809
03:47:39,970 --> 03:47:41,270
Yeah, I don't know if that was them or us.

4810
03:47:41,270 --> 03:47:41,810
It was us.

4811
03:47:41,890 --> 03:47:42,470
It was us.

4812
03:47:42,930 --> 03:47:43,350
Oh, they did?

4813
03:47:43,410 --> 03:47:43,650
Okay.

4814
03:47:44,830 --> 03:47:47,090
I'm, like, 78% sure.

4815
03:47:47,790 --> 03:47:49,430
I'm not 100% sure.

4816
03:47:49,650 --> 03:47:51,010
That's a passing grade.

4817
03:47:51,150 --> 03:47:51,850
They have Black Panther ult, though.

4818
03:47:53,110 --> 03:47:53,990
They have Black Panther ult.

4819
03:47:56,590 --> 03:47:57,610
Our Stringy's ult.

4820
03:47:58,550 --> 03:47:59,250
Our Stringy's ult.

4821
03:48:00,050 --> 03:48:00,490
No!

4822
03:48:00,590 --> 03:48:01,350
Fuck, I knew it!

4823
03:48:01,850 --> 03:48:02,770
Oh, thank god.

4824
03:48:05,530 --> 03:48:06,410
Our supports are little.

4825
03:48:06,690 --> 03:48:07,030
Nice.

4826
03:48:08,710 --> 03:48:10,950
Uh, there's a guy down here.

4827
03:48:11,170 --> 03:48:11,450
Psylocke.

4828
03:48:14,330 --> 03:48:16,230
Nutsack Jones is kind of eating the shit.

4829
03:48:16,490 --> 03:48:16,670
Lowkey.

4830
03:48:17,350 --> 03:48:17,910
Nevermind.

4831
03:48:18,170 --> 03:48:18,930
I have to reload.

4832
03:48:20,350 --> 03:48:21,170
I have ult, too.

4833
03:48:27,890 --> 03:48:29,910
What is that guy doing?

4834
03:48:30,490 --> 03:48:30,970
No!

4835
03:48:31,630 --> 03:48:32,630
I couldn't!

4836
03:48:35,900 --> 03:48:38,500
You only have, uh...

4837
03:48:38,500 --> 03:48:39,440
Poke heals.

4838
03:48:40,580 --> 03:48:41,840
I'm coming back!

4839
03:48:42,240 --> 03:48:44,240
I'm gonna try to get my ult as soon as I can.

4840
03:48:44,500 --> 03:48:45,000
I'm coming back.

4841
03:48:45,040 --> 03:48:46,000
You guys can live.

4842
03:48:46,700 --> 03:48:47,880
I have support ult.

4843
03:48:48,820 --> 03:48:49,520
I think it's winnable.

4844
03:48:50,380 --> 03:48:51,620
No, I'm dead.

4845
03:48:52,620 --> 03:48:52,960
I'm here!

4846
03:48:54,460 --> 03:48:55,940
Fuck, okay!

4847
03:48:57,000 --> 03:48:58,320
Um, this is bad.

4848
03:48:58,480 --> 03:49:00,900
I didn't think...

4849
03:49:01,740 --> 03:49:02,180
That's...

4850
03:49:02,180 --> 03:49:03,640
I think we win that?

4851
03:49:04,220 --> 03:49:04,660
Maybe.

4852
03:49:06,080 --> 03:49:06,560
Maybe.

4853
03:49:10,140 --> 03:49:11,340
Oh, wait!

4854
03:49:11,420 --> 03:49:11,840
That's fine!

4855
03:49:11,920 --> 03:49:13,140
They used I, too.

4856
03:49:15,280 --> 03:49:17,020
We totally killed Black Panther here.

4857
03:49:17,880 --> 03:49:18,760
I might die, though.

4858
03:49:19,680 --> 03:49:20,620
We can reset.

4859
03:49:20,780 --> 03:49:21,220
We can reset.

4860
03:49:22,420 --> 03:49:23,040
Psylocke's one.

4861
03:49:24,760 --> 03:49:26,040
He's just getting healed.

4862
03:49:26,320 --> 03:49:27,920
We should reset here.

4863
03:49:28,880 --> 03:49:29,860
We're down two.

4864
03:49:29,920 --> 03:49:30,980
I don't think we should fight this.

4865
03:49:31,940 --> 03:49:32,560
We're down three.

4866
03:49:32,560 --> 03:49:34,180
I'll just take height.

4867
03:49:37,760 --> 03:49:38,900
I'll just farm my ult.

4868
03:49:41,320 --> 03:49:44,640
I'm trying to save the strange, but he might...

4869
03:49:45,160 --> 03:49:45,820
He's fine.

4870
03:49:46,020 --> 03:49:46,540
He's back.

4871
03:49:47,400 --> 03:49:48,560
They used I, so...

4872
03:49:51,000 --> 03:49:52,920
They don't have I, but they might have support ult.

4873
03:49:53,280 --> 03:49:54,580
And they used Psylocke ult, too.

4874
03:49:56,620 --> 03:49:57,480
I froze somebody.

4875
03:49:57,780 --> 03:49:58,920
Oh, no.

4876
03:49:58,920 --> 03:49:58,960
I froze.

4877
03:50:03,010 --> 03:50:04,250
I'm trying to send their supports.

4878
03:50:08,300 --> 03:50:09,260
I have Black Panther on me.

4879
03:50:10,660 --> 03:50:11,060
Oh!

4880
03:50:12,020 --> 03:50:12,580
He's low.

4881
03:50:12,620 --> 03:50:12,880
He's low.

4882
03:50:12,920 --> 03:50:13,220
He's low.

4883
03:50:13,720 --> 03:50:14,240
He's one.

4884
03:50:14,320 --> 03:50:14,560
He's one.

4885
03:50:14,640 --> 03:50:14,800
He's one.

4886
03:50:14,800 --> 03:50:15,120
He's one.

4887
03:50:15,200 --> 03:50:15,420
He's one.

4888
03:50:15,560 --> 03:50:16,780
Yeah, but we're down.

4889
03:50:16,900 --> 03:50:17,420
We're down.

4890
03:50:18,420 --> 03:50:21,240
I don't think it's worth it.

4891
03:50:21,260 --> 03:50:23,020
We gotta play against next round.

4892
03:50:24,960 --> 03:50:25,760
I think...

4893
03:50:28,480 --> 03:50:30,360
I'm gonna see if I can farm my Luna ult, then.

4894
03:50:33,560 --> 03:50:36,100
Okay, we go into this fight with 6 ults, so we're good.

4895
03:50:37,640 --> 03:50:39,140
Yeah, but we gotta make sure we don't ult everything.

4896
03:50:39,820 --> 03:50:40,220
Yeah.

4897
03:50:42,020 --> 03:50:45,220
Uh, I'll use Psylocke ult to force Luna.

4898
03:50:46,060 --> 03:50:46,460
Yippee!

4899
03:50:46,580 --> 03:50:49,020
Okay, I'll just kill everything after the Luna's down.

4900
03:50:49,100 --> 03:50:49,980
Yeah, sounds good.

4901
03:50:53,160 --> 03:50:54,300
We're gonna do it the other way around.

4902
03:50:54,380 --> 03:50:54,880
We can use mine.

4903
03:50:55,240 --> 03:50:56,060
I'm not sure.

4904
03:50:56,640 --> 03:50:57,880
Which one do you think has more kill pressure?

4905
03:50:59,340 --> 03:50:59,740
What?

4906
03:51:00,600 --> 03:51:02,100
Which ult do you think has more kill pressure?

4907
03:51:02,280 --> 03:51:02,880
Mine or his?

4908
03:51:04,120 --> 03:51:06,000
One of us has to force Luna ult.

4909
03:51:06,320 --> 03:51:09,740
Ideally, Ruben's ult would have more kills, because...

4910
03:51:10,740 --> 03:51:10,940
Okay.

4911
03:51:11,700 --> 03:51:15,740
He can kill the supports easily, but it really depends on the positioning of people.

4912
03:51:16,580 --> 03:51:18,680
Because he can't kill people if there's more than three.

4913
03:51:19,500 --> 03:51:19,840
Yeah.

4914
03:51:21,900 --> 03:51:26,720
And their supports have been playing a little spread, which has made it hard to ult both of them.

4915
03:51:26,720 --> 03:51:29,140
Then we should just use...

4916
03:51:29,140 --> 03:51:30,900
Yeah, you can force ult then.

4917
03:51:36,380 --> 03:51:39,000
I am having a rough time this game.

4918
03:51:39,400 --> 03:51:42,200
I feel like I'm not getting peeled at all from my other support.

4919
03:51:42,720 --> 03:51:45,040
So I have to play my life every time.

4920
03:51:45,620 --> 03:51:46,620
And I can't...

4921
03:51:46,620 --> 03:51:48,680
The freeze is so hard for this one.

4922
03:51:48,780 --> 03:51:52,240
This guy... The guy that plays Black Panther is so difficult to freeze.

4923
03:51:53,560 --> 03:51:54,020
Got you.

4924
03:51:54,020 --> 03:51:55,540
Thank you.

4925
03:51:56,360 --> 03:51:57,120
Oh, nice.

4926
03:51:59,420 --> 03:52:00,600
Black Panther top left.

4927
03:52:03,120 --> 03:52:06,020
He is just...

4928
03:52:06,680 --> 03:52:08,820
Wait, that's really good.

4929
03:52:09,580 --> 03:52:10,500
Oh, Black Panther won!

4930
03:52:11,000 --> 03:52:12,240
I got Black Panther.

4931
03:52:13,840 --> 03:52:15,000
I'm not using anything.

4932
03:52:15,220 --> 03:52:15,640
I don't think we should.

4933
03:52:15,680 --> 03:52:16,780
Nah, this is good.

4934
03:52:17,020 --> 03:52:17,880
I don't think we should use anything.

4935
03:52:18,500 --> 03:52:21,500
I can actually die from that.

4936
03:52:21,500 --> 03:52:22,740
This is really good.

4937
03:52:23,540 --> 03:52:24,580
Dude, I just blew everything.

4938
03:52:24,980 --> 03:52:25,500
Yeah, that's good.

4939
03:52:25,620 --> 03:52:26,100
We didn't use anything.

4940
03:52:27,680 --> 03:52:30,500
Psylocke, Cloak, Eye, Luna.

4941
03:52:31,820 --> 03:52:34,700
And they swapped off Psylocke to Magic.

4942
03:52:35,400 --> 03:52:36,560
Oh, wait, no.

4943
03:52:36,960 --> 03:52:37,520
That's bad.

4944
03:52:37,700 --> 03:52:38,220
That's bad.

4945
03:52:38,260 --> 03:52:40,420
I didn't mag.

4946
03:52:45,700 --> 03:52:47,560
They might force my ult then.

4947
03:52:47,940 --> 03:52:48,780
Because I'm just going to get hard.

4948
03:52:48,780 --> 03:52:51,540
Like, me and the Cloak are just going to get hard dived.

4949
03:52:53,400 --> 03:52:54,260
Change dives.

4950
03:52:54,960 --> 03:52:55,400
Nice.

4951
03:52:58,760 --> 03:52:59,520
Magic ban.

4952
03:53:00,740 --> 03:53:01,300
Wow.

4953
03:53:02,000 --> 03:53:03,280
And we only used one for that.

4954
03:53:05,720 --> 03:53:07,120
I'm scared, guys.

4955
03:53:07,300 --> 03:53:08,300
I'm so scared.

4956
03:53:09,060 --> 03:53:10,000
I'm so...

4957
03:53:10,000 --> 03:53:13,580
Yo, literally scream whenever you get dove and I'll help out.

4958
03:53:13,600 --> 03:53:15,100
That's every time!

4959
03:53:15,560 --> 03:53:18,280
I want you to fucking yell at me whenever you die.

4960
03:53:18,380 --> 03:53:20,280
Okay, but now I'm paying attention to it.

4961
03:53:20,360 --> 03:53:21,780
What do you mean?

4962
03:53:22,460 --> 03:53:23,300
I'm getting dove!

4963
03:53:25,120 --> 03:53:26,480
There we go.

4964
03:53:26,580 --> 03:53:26,780
See?

4965
03:53:28,080 --> 03:53:29,900
Okay, everything is fine.

4966
03:53:31,000 --> 03:53:32,120
Their Luna's one!

4967
03:53:33,140 --> 03:53:33,980
Strange is low.

4968
03:53:34,040 --> 03:53:34,640
Strange is half.

4969
03:53:34,740 --> 03:53:35,340
Strange is half.

4970
03:53:37,300 --> 03:53:38,320
McNeil's low too.

4971
03:53:38,520 --> 03:53:39,220
McNeil's one.

4972
03:53:40,520 --> 03:53:41,200
I'm good.

4973
03:53:41,360 --> 03:53:42,080
Don't worry about me.

4974
03:53:44,140 --> 03:53:44,940
McNeil's low.

4975
03:53:44,940 --> 03:53:45,920
Oh, he lives!

4976
03:53:50,140 --> 03:53:53,920
I don't know, but I'm trying to make sure you guys are alive.

4977
03:53:55,980 --> 03:53:57,520
Black Panther on the right!

4978
03:53:59,480 --> 03:54:00,040
Help!

4979
03:54:00,540 --> 03:54:01,660
He's on my team!

4980
03:54:01,680 --> 03:54:02,820
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

4981
03:54:03,200 --> 03:54:04,100
I'm ulting this.

4982
03:54:05,240 --> 03:54:06,120
Don't, don't, don't!

4983
03:54:06,700 --> 03:54:07,760
Don't mean, okay?

4984
03:54:08,520 --> 03:54:09,420
We're okay.

4985
03:54:10,620 --> 03:54:12,120
That's a lot of ults.

4986
03:54:12,600 --> 03:54:14,080
I'm backing up.

4987
03:54:16,360 --> 03:54:17,980
Nah, but like, what if I win this though?

4988
03:54:18,000 --> 03:54:19,260
Oh my god, they're all behind me!

4989
03:54:19,660 --> 03:54:20,420
They're coming for me!

4990
03:54:21,840 --> 03:54:23,800
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

4991
03:54:24,820 --> 03:54:25,760
That's fine, that's fine.

4992
03:54:25,800 --> 03:54:26,700
Our tanks are...

4993
03:54:27,220 --> 03:54:28,360
Our tanks are okay.

4994
03:54:29,200 --> 03:54:30,600
Our tanks are okay!

4995
03:54:32,460 --> 03:54:32,980
It's fine!

4996
03:54:33,380 --> 03:54:35,600
Everything is fine.

4997
03:54:35,820 --> 03:54:36,440
This is it.

4998
03:54:36,800 --> 03:54:38,360
This is where our win streak starts.

4999
03:54:38,920 --> 03:54:40,100
It's not just that simple.

5000
03:54:40,100 --> 03:54:42,800
I've honestly never had an easier game in my life.

5001
03:54:42,860 --> 03:54:43,940
Oh my god!

5002
03:54:44,000 --> 03:54:45,960
That was the hardest game in my fucking life!

5003
03:54:46,280 --> 03:54:46,740
Dude!

5004
03:54:47,420 --> 03:54:49,180
That felt like a silver game.

5005
03:54:49,260 --> 03:54:50,140
What rank are we again?

5006
03:54:51,440 --> 03:54:55,340
I literally am getting, getting fucked right there.

5007
03:54:55,420 --> 03:54:57,200
That was just so free!

5008
03:54:58,220 --> 03:55:03,500
That was, I'm surprised I even passed 30k healing with the amount of pressure they put on me.

5009
03:55:04,300 --> 03:55:05,580
It's just too easy.

5010
03:55:08,860 --> 03:55:09,980
Guys, I...

5011
03:55:09,980 --> 03:55:13,200
That game actually sucked so much.

5012
03:55:13,960 --> 03:55:15,980
I've never hated...

5013
03:55:17,340 --> 03:55:20,320
I've never hated this game before.

5014
03:55:20,580 --> 03:55:20,960
I've never hated this game before.

5015
03:55:22,260 --> 03:55:23,620
I told you to do it.

5016
03:55:23,760 --> 03:55:24,960
You're just tuning it out.

5017
03:55:28,400 --> 03:55:33,520
I like how that was the first time I ever got saved by you guys.

5018
03:55:34,540 --> 03:55:36,240
I've never got saved before.

5019
03:55:37,220 --> 03:55:37,980
Oh jeez.

5020
03:55:39,160 --> 03:55:40,280
That was...

5021
03:55:41,500 --> 03:55:42,060
Yes,

5022
03:55:45,300 --> 03:55:45,760
Hawkeye.

5023
03:55:45,860 --> 03:55:48,040
I refuse to play against a Hawkeye.

5024
03:55:48,100 --> 03:55:48,840
We always lose.

5025
03:55:51,240 --> 03:55:55,960
I've never played a game since I got to Diamond with Hawkeye unbanned.

5026
03:55:56,440 --> 03:56:01,880
And the only reason why I've ever played in a game with Hela unbanned is because the other team assumed we would ban Hela.

5027
03:56:02,320 --> 03:56:03,780
We should ban Hulk second.

5028
03:56:04,320 --> 03:56:05,980
If Hela's open, I'll just...

5029
03:56:05,980 --> 03:56:06,780
I'll gap there, Hela.

5030
03:56:07,120 --> 03:56:09,180
Do they have a Hulk player?

5031
03:56:09,380 --> 03:56:11,380
The Ironman-Hulk combo's just broken.

5032
03:56:11,620 --> 03:56:12,800
Do they have one?

5033
03:56:13,720 --> 03:56:16,800
I don't know, but I would just rather never play against Hulk.

5034
03:56:16,820 --> 03:56:18,340
I'll just put Hulk.

5035
03:56:20,080 --> 03:56:22,640
He's got the highest win rate right now in the game.

5036
03:56:23,460 --> 03:56:25,400
Guys, do we know any Hulk 1 tricks?

5037
03:56:26,420 --> 03:56:27,860
That we can...

5038
03:56:27,860 --> 03:56:28,400
I'll vote for Hulk.

5039
03:56:29,700 --> 03:56:30,200
No!

5040
03:56:30,200 --> 03:56:30,280
No!

5041
03:56:33,780 --> 03:56:34,220
Fuck!

5042
03:56:36,580 --> 03:56:37,460
My baby!

5043
03:56:38,220 --> 03:56:42,300
Guys, do any one of us know a Hulk 1 trick that wants to stack with us?

5044
03:56:42,520 --> 03:56:42,920
Maybe you...

5045
03:56:42,920 --> 03:56:45,400
Alright, I'm voting Hulk right now!

5046
03:56:45,720 --> 03:56:46,060
No!

5047
03:56:47,820 --> 03:56:49,880
I mean, if you play Hulk, I can...

5048
03:56:49,880 --> 03:56:50,940
I've never played Hulk before, no.

5049
03:56:50,940 --> 03:56:52,420
Okay, I was gonna say...

5050
03:56:55,810 --> 03:56:56,250
Fuck.

5051
03:56:56,430 --> 03:56:57,090
Okay, Cable.

5052
03:56:57,190 --> 03:56:57,950
You play Tank, right?

5053
03:57:00,770 --> 03:57:01,170
Cable?

5054
03:57:01,930 --> 03:57:03,110
Alright, we'll find out.

5055
03:57:03,530 --> 03:57:05,390
Cable, you're not gonna make me solo tank, right?

5056
03:57:05,930 --> 03:57:07,050
He's gonna make you solo tank.

5057
03:57:07,130 --> 03:57:07,970
I hope he does.

5058
03:57:08,490 --> 03:57:09,970
It's okay, I'll front line with you.

5059
03:57:10,410 --> 03:57:10,790
You'll be okay.

5060
03:57:10,790 --> 03:57:11,450
Thank God.

5061
03:57:14,070 --> 03:57:16,970
Okay, but he's on Strange, so like, what if I just go with third DPS?

5062
03:57:18,650 --> 03:57:19,890
You're the bastard now.

5063
03:57:21,450 --> 03:57:22,630
You're the problem.

5064
03:57:22,870 --> 03:57:26,530
I guilt this guy into playing Strange, and I'm like, you know what, dude?

5065
03:57:26,590 --> 03:57:27,730
What if I just go with third DPS?

5066
03:57:27,930 --> 03:57:28,690
I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

5067
03:57:30,130 --> 03:57:31,710
What if I just pick Spider-Man?

5068
03:57:31,870 --> 03:57:34,650
What if I just run it down the entire game?

5069
03:57:35,050 --> 03:57:38,030
Yo, guys, I'm actually the greatest Black Widow player on Earth.

5070
03:57:41,830 --> 03:57:42,190
So...

5071
03:57:42,190 --> 03:57:42,850
Alright.

5072
03:57:44,370 --> 03:57:45,090
Magneto time.

5073
03:57:46,250 --> 03:57:49,210
Also, I'll bubble you off cooldown, and you just beat them up.

5074
03:57:49,990 --> 03:57:50,930
Are we portaling?

5075
03:57:51,490 --> 03:57:52,010
We're portaling.

5076
03:57:52,010 --> 03:57:52,770
Portaling.

5077
03:57:54,290 --> 03:57:55,510
Cable's daddy's gonna portal.

5078
03:57:59,710 --> 03:58:01,570
Alright, guys.

5079
03:58:01,850 --> 03:58:02,710
Let's see if I live.

5080
03:58:03,110 --> 03:58:03,830
Now we're defending.

5081
03:58:05,570 --> 03:58:06,670
They pushed up.

5082
03:58:06,750 --> 03:58:07,770
There's no one in high ground.

5083
03:58:08,110 --> 03:58:09,290
You're just gonna have to do it, brother.

5084
03:58:09,570 --> 03:58:10,070
Alright, bet.

5085
03:58:15,230 --> 03:58:15,990
He's low, he's low.

5086
03:58:16,290 --> 03:58:18,050
Oh my God.

5087
03:58:18,050 --> 03:58:18,630
I'm high-bubbling.

5088
03:58:19,050 --> 03:58:19,450
Not now.

5089
03:58:20,310 --> 03:58:21,410
In two, one...

5090
03:58:21,410 --> 03:58:22,650
Jesus Christ!

5091
03:58:22,890 --> 03:58:23,590
What the fuck?

5092
03:58:23,590 --> 03:58:24,330
How are you guys...

5093
03:58:26,390 --> 03:58:27,250
I'm scared.

5094
03:58:27,890 --> 03:58:28,370
Wait.

5095
03:58:28,530 --> 03:58:29,270
Nah, don't be scared.

5096
03:58:29,370 --> 03:58:29,850
I got you.

5097
03:58:30,230 --> 03:58:30,870
I'm scared.

5098
03:58:32,670 --> 03:58:33,410
No, wait.

5099
03:58:33,570 --> 03:58:34,290
I shield you.

5100
03:58:35,250 --> 03:58:37,710
I think you have to die.

5101
03:58:39,430 --> 03:58:42,230
How did everybody die so fast?

5102
03:58:42,410 --> 03:58:43,770
Oh no, they have a panther too.

5103
03:58:48,050 --> 03:58:49,890
This is not a good magic game with our comp.

5104
03:58:51,490 --> 03:58:52,590
Alright, what are you gonna play?

5105
03:58:53,810 --> 03:58:54,510
I'm not sure.

5106
03:58:57,110 --> 03:58:58,290
I'll figure it out.

5107
03:58:58,950 --> 03:59:00,170
I might assassinate someone.

5108
03:59:01,470 --> 03:59:04,010
I'm either about to force an ult here or...

5109
03:59:04,010 --> 03:59:05,170
I froze somebody.

5110
03:59:07,850 --> 03:59:09,230
He shifted out.

5111
03:59:10,630 --> 03:59:12,010
I got you.

5112
03:59:15,750 --> 03:59:16,850
My panther's low.

5113
03:59:16,970 --> 03:59:17,610
Oh my God.

5114
03:59:18,870 --> 03:59:20,850
Okay, I just leave I guess.

5115
03:59:21,770 --> 03:59:24,030
They used two ults for it though.

5116
03:59:24,350 --> 03:59:25,430
So we can chill.

5117
03:59:27,510 --> 03:59:29,090
This guy's getting pocketed.

5118
03:59:29,170 --> 03:59:30,290
I can't fucking win.

5119
03:59:30,590 --> 03:59:31,630
Even though he's horrible.

5120
03:59:31,830 --> 03:59:32,610
Oh my God, I won!

5121
03:59:33,230 --> 03:59:35,050
Yeah, your magneto helped you.

5122
03:59:35,650 --> 03:59:36,250
Or not magneto.

5123
03:59:36,250 --> 03:59:37,650
Yeah, you're a Dr. Strange.

5124
03:59:37,770 --> 03:59:38,830
No, yeah, it was the magneto.

5125
03:59:38,870 --> 03:59:39,450
I did that.

5126
03:59:41,150 --> 03:59:42,130
I'm taking credit.

5127
03:59:42,930 --> 03:59:45,290
Yo, this magneto's running it down high key.

5128
03:59:46,030 --> 03:59:48,330
I'm trying to save our Dr. Strange right now.

5129
03:59:48,610 --> 03:59:49,690
Oh wait, we have two picks.

5130
03:59:49,890 --> 03:59:50,190
We should go.

5131
03:59:51,410 --> 03:59:54,410
Yeah, we got two picks there.

5132
03:59:55,150 --> 03:59:56,690
I'm trying to help you guys over there.

5133
03:59:57,250 --> 03:59:59,890
And I'm gonna go back to the main point.

5134
04:00:00,490 --> 04:00:02,010
Use my main point.

5135
04:00:02,890 --> 04:00:04,730
Nah, but like, what if I kill Aethel?

5136
04:00:04,990 --> 04:00:06,150
Alright, I die here I guess.

5137
04:00:06,390 --> 04:00:06,730
Okay.

5138
04:00:07,890 --> 04:00:13,690
I got thrown a whale and then a magneto ult to finish the job.

5139
04:00:15,330 --> 04:00:16,950
That's so fucked.

5140
04:00:19,830 --> 04:00:21,830
Oh, that's beautiful.

5141
04:00:22,550 --> 04:00:23,970
Guys, what the fuck?

5142
04:00:24,290 --> 04:00:25,950
That was so fucked up.

5143
04:00:26,370 --> 04:00:29,330
That was actually so fucked up.

5144
04:00:29,330 --> 04:00:29,750
Oh, shit.

5145
04:00:31,730 --> 04:00:34,610
I've never had an easier capture in my life, I think.

5146
04:00:34,870 --> 04:00:35,270
In particular.

5147
04:00:36,890 --> 04:00:39,070
That's a hate crime right there.

5148
04:00:39,630 --> 04:00:42,010
Wait, am I a terrible person for making us play double shield?

5149
04:00:43,590 --> 04:00:44,630
Holy shit.

5150
04:00:46,190 --> 04:00:46,930
Bro, like...

5151
04:00:46,930 --> 04:00:47,490
I'm gonna save.

5152
04:00:48,710 --> 04:00:49,750
Oh, fuck.

5153
04:00:50,170 --> 04:00:51,870
I knew this would happen.

5154
04:00:55,570 --> 04:00:57,050
Like, I don't understand.

5155
04:00:57,050 --> 04:01:00,150
What did I do to deserve that?

5156
04:01:03,210 --> 04:01:07,310
ArtStrange is not this fucking Narnia right now.

5157
04:01:09,570 --> 04:01:11,470
There's a magneto on me.

5158
04:01:14,820 --> 04:01:16,090
Okay, that's unlucky.

5159
04:01:20,170 --> 04:01:23,150
I might be dead through this, unless...

5160
04:01:23,150 --> 04:01:23,770
I'm ulting too.

5161
04:01:23,770 --> 04:01:24,610
Oh, shit.

5162
04:01:25,830 --> 04:01:29,730
Oh my god, I can't save you down there because there's trees!

5163
04:01:30,390 --> 04:01:32,090
Nah, but like...

5164
04:01:32,090 --> 04:01:32,330
Nice.

5165
04:01:33,510 --> 04:01:35,310
If you can get in here, I can heal you.

5166
04:01:37,190 --> 04:01:39,490
Did you get the biggest magneto ult of all time?

5167
04:01:39,730 --> 04:01:41,370
I got no one, actually.

5168
04:01:42,590 --> 04:01:43,390
There's a tree.

5169
04:01:43,550 --> 04:01:45,610
I can't heal anybody through it.

5170
04:01:47,390 --> 04:01:48,790
Kill the magneto.

5171
04:01:49,170 --> 04:01:49,750
Magneto on point.

5172
04:01:49,750 --> 04:01:50,730
Magneto on point.

5173
04:01:51,350 --> 04:01:52,370
Magneto on point.

5174
04:01:52,750 --> 04:01:55,950
What are you doing?

5175
04:01:59,090 --> 04:02:01,950
Woah, what am I watching?

5176
04:02:03,770 --> 04:02:05,810
I just wanna live.

5177
04:02:05,890 --> 04:02:07,510
Oh, I just took ArtStrange's portal.

5178
04:02:07,630 --> 04:02:09,490
I thought it was theirs and I was about to have a sick flank.

5179
04:02:10,310 --> 04:02:11,590
Fuck, I'm walking back to spawn.

5180
04:02:14,790 --> 04:02:17,850
ArtStrange is flying into them.

5181
04:02:20,270 --> 04:02:21,850
The meat wall's down!

5182
04:02:22,030 --> 04:02:23,030
We can kill this guy!

5183
04:02:24,030 --> 04:02:24,790
Oh, thank god.

5184
04:02:24,810 --> 04:02:27,110
I hate the meat wall.

5185
04:02:33,570 --> 04:02:36,130
I don't think we can win this fight.

5186
04:02:37,890 --> 04:02:40,070
I don't think we're winning this.

5187
04:02:40,970 --> 04:02:42,970
We gotta back up.

5188
04:02:44,590 --> 04:02:46,830
All I know is I have gold limbs, so I'm chilling.

5189
04:02:47,090 --> 04:02:52,350
I don't know what to do Sometimes I feel like I'm getting targeted so hard.

5190
04:02:52,570 --> 04:02:55,650
What have I ever done to deserve that chat?

5191
04:02:58,170 --> 04:02:59,350
I killed myself.

5192
04:02:59,590 --> 04:03:00,310
I was greedy.

5193
04:03:00,750 --> 04:03:04,490
At least I'm honest.

5194
04:03:06,030 --> 04:03:07,370
Alright, I'm back.

5195
04:03:09,670 --> 04:03:11,210
Hopefully we don't start engaging.

5196
04:03:11,390 --> 04:03:12,070
There's a namor.

5197
04:03:12,210 --> 04:03:12,990
Namor's frozen.

5198
04:03:13,770 --> 04:03:15,870
I don't know what to do with it, but he's frozen.

5199
04:03:15,870 --> 04:03:17,590
That is... okay, bro.

5200
04:03:17,910 --> 04:03:18,630
They have Groot ult.

5201
04:03:19,970 --> 04:03:21,290
Yeah, they almost...

5202
04:03:21,290 --> 04:03:22,450
They don't have a Groot.

5203
04:03:22,850 --> 04:03:24,910
He's going in.

5204
04:03:25,330 --> 04:03:27,910
Namor's behind you guys!

5205
04:03:28,690 --> 04:03:29,010
Okay.

5206
04:03:32,030 --> 04:03:32,410
Groot slow!

5207
04:03:33,930 --> 04:03:34,650
Groot slow, yeah.

5208
04:03:35,410 --> 04:03:36,610
No, she froze me.

5209
04:03:38,370 --> 04:03:39,670
It's fine, we cap point.

5210
04:03:40,870 --> 04:03:43,190
This Magneto ult is gonna go crazy.

5211
04:03:43,190 --> 04:03:44,010
Alright.

5212
04:03:44,330 --> 04:03:45,310
There's a Magneto in front of us.

5213
04:03:45,370 --> 04:03:46,070
There's a Magneto on point.

5214
04:03:47,650 --> 04:03:48,610
Please, don't...

5215
04:03:48,610 --> 04:03:49,450
Magneto's behind you, Ruben!

5216
04:03:49,590 --> 04:03:50,370
Magneto's one!

5217
04:03:54,470 --> 04:03:57,070
My bubble went to someone across my screen.

5218
04:03:58,750 --> 04:04:00,950
There's a Magneto to our left!

5219
04:04:01,010 --> 04:04:01,950
There's a Magneto to our left!

5220
04:04:02,250 --> 04:04:04,670
I'm gonna freaking freak out.

5221
04:04:05,050 --> 04:04:06,310
I got freaking scammed.

5222
04:04:08,510 --> 04:04:09,930
I swear to god.

5223
04:04:09,930 --> 04:04:10,710
Uh-oh.

5224
04:04:10,790 --> 04:04:11,940
I don't like that.

5225
04:04:13,810 --> 04:04:14,950
I blocked it.

5226
04:04:15,250 --> 04:04:16,330
I'm him.

5227
04:04:16,370 --> 04:04:17,650
Who is this one Magneto?

5228
04:04:17,790 --> 04:04:19,310
Thank god he's actually dead.

5229
04:04:19,770 --> 04:04:21,350
Oh, he cancelled Groot ult!

5230
04:04:22,010 --> 04:04:22,550
Nice.

5231
04:04:22,730 --> 04:04:23,890
They have no tank ults.

5232
04:04:25,090 --> 04:04:25,950
Oh my god.

5233
04:04:26,070 --> 04:04:29,010
This Magneto lived for twenty fucking years!

5234
04:04:29,530 --> 04:04:31,450
How many times do I have to scream Magneto?

5235
04:04:31,830 --> 04:04:32,630
What are they doing up there?

5236
04:04:33,350 --> 04:04:34,710
To my team!

5237
04:04:35,190 --> 04:04:36,610
There's teams to our left.

5238
04:04:37,930 --> 04:04:38,570
It's okay.

5239
04:04:38,570 --> 04:04:39,930
Meat Wall's here to save us.

5240
04:04:41,110 --> 04:04:42,790
I'm opening the meat.

5241
04:04:42,830 --> 04:04:43,310
Pause.

5242
04:04:44,230 --> 04:04:45,570
There's more over here.

5243
04:04:45,970 --> 04:04:47,050
Wait, what?

5244
04:04:48,430 --> 04:04:49,530
Fish guy's like one.

5245
04:04:50,250 --> 04:04:52,590
There's a Meat Wall separating you from...

5246
04:04:52,590 --> 04:04:53,090
It's okay.

5247
04:04:53,390 --> 04:04:54,350
Meat Wall is my friend.

5248
04:04:55,010 --> 04:04:56,130
I love Meat Wall.

5249
04:04:56,270 --> 04:04:58,910
Meat Wall will always be here for me whenever I need someone.

5250
04:04:59,710 --> 04:05:01,490
Meat Wall will never let me down.

5251
04:05:02,410 --> 04:05:04,610
Meat Wall is the most reliable friend I have.

5252
04:05:05,570 --> 04:05:08,610
Meat Wall will always be there to have my back.

5253
04:05:09,070 --> 04:05:10,410
Protect me from evil.

5254
04:05:11,210 --> 04:05:12,210
Just shoot the Magneto!

5255
04:05:12,890 --> 04:05:14,350
I'm so sorry, what?

5256
04:05:14,930 --> 04:05:17,810
I'm just trying to do the shoot to Magneto.

5257
04:05:18,490 --> 04:05:20,370
I'm still alive!

5258
04:05:21,430 --> 04:05:22,870
Oh, he let's him live!

5259
04:05:26,280 --> 04:05:29,000
I do the fucking Meat Wall.

5260
04:05:29,220 --> 04:05:29,920
Yippee!

5261
04:05:30,360 --> 04:05:32,540
The Magneto just runs around!

5262
04:05:38,860 --> 04:05:40,200
Oh, but it's fine.

5263
04:05:40,300 --> 04:05:41,040
I'm fine.

5264
04:05:42,300 --> 04:05:43,280
I'm fine.

5265
04:05:43,440 --> 04:05:46,520
I feel like I was more locked in when I wasn't in voice chat.

5266
04:05:50,520 --> 04:05:51,500
No, I am.

5267
04:05:51,780 --> 04:05:54,400
I mean, I was definitely more locked in.

5268
04:05:58,980 --> 04:05:59,960
I'm fine.

5269
04:06:01,020 --> 04:06:01,820
I'm fine.

5270
04:06:02,020 --> 04:06:04,580
I'm playing like an idiot right now.

5271
04:06:04,580 --> 04:06:06,460
I'm my own worst enemy.

5272
04:06:06,720 --> 04:06:08,260
It's more fun.

5273
04:06:08,660 --> 04:06:14,720
I'm definitely more like my gameplay and positioning is so much better when I'm in VC.

5274
04:06:15,080 --> 04:06:17,100
When I'm in VC, I'm not locked in.

5275
04:06:22,840 --> 04:06:25,480
I fucked it up.

5276
04:06:25,580 --> 04:06:26,880
Don't take that.

5277
04:06:29,540 --> 04:06:34,720
Nah, you think they're gonna TP up there onto Doki?

5278
04:06:34,920 --> 04:06:35,680
That would never happen.

5279
04:06:36,140 --> 04:06:38,540
Nah, they would never just assassinate Doki.

5280
04:06:38,640 --> 04:06:40,160
No, don't say that, please.

5281
04:06:40,360 --> 04:06:43,120
The Magneto literally W-keys into me.

5282
04:06:43,760 --> 04:06:44,300
They're walking?

5283
04:06:49,400 --> 04:06:49,860
Nice.

5284
04:06:50,940 --> 04:06:52,720
Wait, they're walking or are they taking portal?

5285
04:06:53,240 --> 04:06:53,920
They're going left.

5286
04:06:54,500 --> 04:06:55,020
Okay.

5287
04:06:55,720 --> 04:06:57,800
I'm moving to the right then.

5288
04:06:58,940 --> 04:06:59,700
Oh, yeah.

5289
04:07:05,770 --> 04:07:07,090
I'm looking perfect.

5290
04:07:08,170 --> 04:07:09,330
Oh my god, you got the pig.

5291
04:07:11,790 --> 04:07:12,390
Killed one.

5292
04:07:14,070 --> 04:07:14,870
Oh, fuck!

5293
04:07:15,190 --> 04:07:16,670
You're so healthy, you're so healthy.

5294
04:07:17,850 --> 04:07:20,430
I'm glad they made Sigma into a hero in this game.

5295
04:07:22,190 --> 04:07:25,090
Do you guys see the human torch Lee?

5296
04:07:25,750 --> 04:07:26,710
I think Sigma's cool.

5297
04:07:27,450 --> 04:07:28,710
I think he's a pretty wicked guy.

5298
04:07:28,870 --> 04:07:30,210
Do you guys see the human torch Lee?

5299
04:07:31,210 --> 04:07:31,610
Yeah.

5300
04:07:31,610 --> 04:07:31,670
Yeah.

5301
04:07:34,030 --> 04:07:35,570
Dude, he looks kind of wicked.

5302
04:07:35,750 --> 04:07:39,010
I can't wait for Mr. Fantastic with his tanky body.

5303
04:07:40,170 --> 04:07:42,330
And he has a team up with Storm.

5304
04:07:44,070 --> 04:07:45,390
Yeah, that's sick.

5305
04:07:46,590 --> 04:07:48,170
Who the fuck plays Storm?

5306
04:07:48,510 --> 04:07:50,130
Who the fuck plays it?

5307
04:07:51,870 --> 04:07:53,330
That's going to be my next main, what do you mean?

5308
04:07:53,330 --> 04:07:54,390
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk!

5309
04:07:55,090 --> 04:07:58,190
Nah, dude, Storm's taunts are up, I'm telling you.

5310
04:07:59,650 --> 04:08:00,870
Oh, they have Moon Knight.

5311
04:08:00,950 --> 04:08:03,090
They have Moon Knight now.

5312
04:08:05,790 --> 04:08:06,730
He's low, he's low!

5313
04:08:07,130 --> 04:08:07,750
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk!

5314
04:08:08,110 --> 04:08:09,150
Hulk half, Hulk half.

5315
04:08:10,890 --> 04:08:12,030
Fuck him up.

5316
04:08:13,530 --> 04:08:15,050
Oh, I died to Moon Knight, but I killed Groot.

5317
04:08:15,210 --> 04:08:16,410
Yeah, Moon Knight's not one.

5318
04:08:17,790 --> 04:08:18,250
Nice!

5319
04:08:22,530 --> 04:08:25,350
Oh, I got hit.

5320
04:08:25,590 --> 04:08:26,470
I forgot his name.

5321
04:08:26,470 --> 04:08:29,590
The Skull Dude with the leather jacket got leaked too.

5322
04:08:30,110 --> 04:08:31,710
The Skull Dude with the leather jacket?

5323
04:08:32,070 --> 04:08:33,430
Ghost Rider's going to be in-game?

5324
04:08:33,630 --> 04:08:35,130
I'm pretty sure.

5325
04:08:36,130 --> 04:08:38,690
I saw people saying he got leaked as well.

5326
04:08:39,030 --> 04:08:40,490
I saw the new outfits.

5327
04:08:40,690 --> 04:08:41,950
The new outfits are really cool.

5328
04:08:42,570 --> 04:08:44,190
Yeah, the new magic skin looks sick.

5329
04:08:44,790 --> 04:08:46,190
Lunar New Year or Chinese New Year?

5330
04:08:46,850 --> 04:08:47,430
Yeah, yeah.

5331
04:08:47,670 --> 04:08:48,970
Or the Year of the Snake?

5332
04:08:50,330 --> 04:08:51,570
I like the Mantis skin.

5333
04:08:52,130 --> 04:08:53,110
Oh, left side, left side, left side!

5334
04:08:54,750 --> 04:08:56,330
Oh my god!

5335
04:08:58,290 --> 04:09:00,190
I'm good, I'm good.

5336
04:09:02,170 --> 04:09:03,950
I'm fine, I'm altered.

5337
04:09:05,150 --> 04:09:05,630
I'm fine.

5338
04:09:05,750 --> 04:09:06,810
He didn't get anybody, he didn't get anybody.

5339
04:09:06,970 --> 04:09:07,710
He's so stupid.

5340
04:09:08,530 --> 04:09:11,110
I bubbled our guy who's basically invulnerable.

5341
04:09:12,110 --> 04:09:12,730
I'm a genius, I tell you.

5342
04:09:12,730 --> 04:09:15,150
I froze the...

5343
04:09:15,150 --> 04:09:16,610
Jeff look, Jeff look, Jeff one, Jeff look.

5344
04:09:18,270 --> 04:09:20,730
They're just pressing buttons, I think.

5345
04:09:21,110 --> 04:09:22,170
Oh, and he presses another button.

5346
04:09:22,170 --> 04:09:23,550
He's literally just pressing buttons.

5347
04:09:23,630 --> 04:09:25,430
He presses another button.

5348
04:09:27,210 --> 04:09:28,410
I froze, oh wait, never mind.

5349
04:09:28,550 --> 04:09:34,990
Dude, they used Moon Knight ult, they used Jeff ult, they used Magneto ult, they used Iron Man.

5350
04:09:35,150 --> 04:09:36,770
Bro, they used everything!

5351
04:09:37,430 --> 04:09:38,390
Except for Magical.

5352
04:09:39,050 --> 04:09:40,550
Yeah, so they'll have Magical up next.

5353
04:09:43,230 --> 04:09:44,030
Magic's asleep.

5354
04:09:44,790 --> 04:09:45,950
Oh, they have Iron Man now.

5355
04:09:47,150 --> 04:09:50,090
Oh, they've had an Iron Man and he just hasn't been doing anything.

5356
04:09:50,650 --> 04:09:52,870
I didn't even realize they had Iron Man.

5357
04:09:53,330 --> 04:09:56,970
No, yeah, he used his ult last fight too, he's been there for a while.

5358
04:09:58,070 --> 04:09:59,010
Ah, that's chill.

5359
04:09:59,530 --> 04:10:00,530
We're fine, right?

5360
04:10:01,430 --> 04:10:02,190
Are we fine?

5361
04:10:03,790 --> 04:10:04,730
Are we fine?

5362
04:10:05,210 --> 04:10:06,370
I'm trying to help you, Athol.

5363
04:10:06,750 --> 04:10:08,130
He's half, he's low, he's one.

5364
04:10:08,910 --> 04:10:09,690
Knock him up.

5365
04:10:10,890 --> 04:10:11,590
He's out of mech.

5366
04:10:11,670 --> 04:10:13,690
He's out of mech.

5367
04:10:14,830 --> 04:10:16,910
I'm good, don't worry about me.

5368
04:10:18,030 --> 04:10:20,250
What is this, where are you going?

5369
04:10:20,710 --> 04:10:21,550
What the fuck?

5370
04:10:22,190 --> 04:10:24,250
Why can't these be our games, Mac?

5371
04:10:24,870 --> 04:10:26,790
These are our games!

5372
04:10:27,230 --> 04:10:30,030
No, you should have seen our games earlier, Ruben.

5373
04:10:32,330 --> 04:10:34,830
Our games earlier were not great.

5374
04:10:35,190 --> 04:10:37,130
They were pretty bad.

5375
04:10:38,490 --> 04:10:42,770
I was playing out of my fucking mind on those games.

5376
04:10:44,030 --> 04:10:47,270
That was like my fifth time playing Magneto, that was great.

5377
04:10:47,670 --> 04:10:51,950
I literally am playing worse right now versus the games we lost, because I'm not focused.

5378
04:10:53,310 --> 04:10:58,490
I think it's a magic gap, I just can't win if I'm not on magic anymore.

5379
04:10:58,850 --> 04:11:00,550
I mean, there's no other explanation.

5380
04:11:02,690 --> 04:11:04,270
Because I played Moon Knight earlier.

5381
04:11:04,590 --> 04:11:07,470
Bro, I need to avoid every single person on their team.

5382
04:11:09,370 --> 04:11:11,750
Oh no, yeah, their team was a little special.

5383
04:11:12,790 --> 04:11:15,070
They were a bunch of little silly guys.

5384
04:11:18,030 --> 04:11:20,530
Their magic has like 7k damage.

5385
04:11:21,210 --> 04:11:23,050
I didn't get to avoid anyone, that's chill.

5386
04:11:23,870 --> 04:11:25,970
Oh my gosh, I feel like we should have avoided their magic.

5387
04:11:26,210 --> 04:11:27,610
Magic Lily has 7k damage.

5388
04:11:27,610 --> 04:11:29,070
Yeah, I mean, we didn't get any of them.

5389
04:11:29,250 --> 04:11:29,730
Are you sure?

5390
04:11:29,910 --> 04:11:30,550
Okay, we didn't.

5391
04:11:30,610 --> 04:11:31,170
Okay, that's good.

5392
04:11:31,910 --> 04:11:32,890
That was getting me a little worried.

5393
04:11:33,290 --> 04:11:34,730
Oh hey, there's the cable guy.

5394
04:11:36,110 --> 04:11:39,130
He was a decent strange, I think.

5395
04:11:40,010 --> 04:11:40,810
Yeah, he was.

5396
04:11:42,910 --> 04:11:44,130
Oh my god.

5397
04:11:44,190 --> 04:11:46,210
Guys, is this what it's like to win on stream?

5398
04:11:46,710 --> 04:11:47,530
Is this...

5399
04:11:48,250 --> 04:11:49,170
Is this...

5400
04:11:50,010 --> 04:11:51,590
Is this what it's like?

5401
04:11:54,550 --> 04:11:56,610
I don't remember what it was like.

5402
04:11:56,770 --> 04:11:57,810
It's been so long.

5403
04:11:58,510 --> 04:12:00,770
It's actually been so long since I...

5404
04:12:05,030 --> 04:12:06,790
It's been so long.

5405
04:12:07,350 --> 04:12:08,770
Stop cursing me!

5406
04:12:09,050 --> 04:12:10,930
God fucking, I went through so much!

5407
04:12:10,930 --> 04:12:11,170
Okay.

5408
04:12:12,070 --> 04:12:16,970
I went through so much.

5409
04:12:17,330 --> 04:12:18,730
I went through so much, guys.

5410
04:12:20,030 --> 04:12:21,310
Is this an Adam game?

5411
04:12:22,170 --> 04:12:23,010
Mantis Adam?

5412
04:12:23,390 --> 04:12:23,510
Is this an Adam game?

5413
04:12:24,790 --> 04:12:25,350
You think?

5414
04:12:25,410 --> 04:12:26,770
Am I throwing if I play Adam?

5415
04:12:26,830 --> 04:12:28,190
The one character I can't play?

5416
04:12:32,000 --> 04:12:33,140
I think it is.

5417
04:12:33,220 --> 04:12:34,600
Nah, it'll be a learning experience.

5418
04:12:34,720 --> 04:12:35,380
That's true.

5419
04:12:35,920 --> 04:12:36,400
No!

5420
04:12:40,760 --> 04:12:43,100
You should have been like, I got Psylocke.

5421
04:12:43,100 --> 04:12:44,460
Can you guys get Hella?

5422
04:12:45,220 --> 04:12:46,260
You should have said that.

5423
04:12:49,160 --> 04:12:50,120
Oh yeah!

5424
04:12:50,980 --> 04:12:52,700
Yeah, I played Deadlock with...

5425
04:12:52,700 --> 04:12:54,420
Was it him that I played Deadlock?

5426
04:12:54,580 --> 04:12:55,220
I don't remember.

5427
04:12:56,440 --> 04:12:57,420
Chat, was it him?

5428
04:12:58,680 --> 04:13:00,720
I've collabed with so many people.

5429
04:13:00,940 --> 04:13:02,440
I'm getting like...

5430
04:13:02,440 --> 04:13:03,800
My name's mixed up now.

5431
04:13:05,180 --> 04:13:06,200
Oh, it was!

5432
04:13:06,260 --> 04:13:08,000
Yeah, he played Deadlock with me.

5433
04:13:08,040 --> 04:13:08,700
He was pretty good.

5434
04:13:13,220 --> 04:13:14,620
On the plane of rain.

5435
04:13:16,080 --> 04:13:16,320
And then...

5436
04:13:16,320 --> 04:13:20,180
To be fair, every pro player in every different type of game is playing this now.

5437
04:13:20,780 --> 04:13:21,080
Yeah.

5438
04:13:21,640 --> 04:13:23,180
Like, it doesn't matter what game.

5439
04:13:23,300 --> 04:13:26,560
I like how Valorant players are trying to learn Kyo shooters too.

5440
04:13:26,760 --> 04:13:27,860
I think it's pretty funny.

5441
04:13:28,120 --> 04:13:28,840
It's cute.

5442
04:13:29,340 --> 04:13:33,020
And then they're saying how they try to go back to Valorant and they're like, I don't know what to do.

5443
04:13:33,060 --> 04:13:34,140
I can't play Valorant anymore.

5444
04:13:34,640 --> 04:13:35,640
The aiming is so different.

5445
04:13:36,040 --> 04:13:42,180
No, they're literally like, I'm losing streaks in Valorant because the aim is so different versus Marvel Rivals.

5446
04:13:42,460 --> 04:13:43,660
And I'm like, good.

5447
04:13:43,980 --> 04:13:46,060
Fuck Valorant.

5448
04:13:47,180 --> 04:13:51,060
I say as I get gifted subs from the Valorant promotion.

5449
04:13:51,060 --> 04:13:51,520
Yo, Valorant!

5450
04:13:51,620 --> 04:13:53,620
They have 100 gifted subs!

5451
04:13:54,160 --> 04:13:54,180
Yo!

5452
04:13:55,080 --> 04:13:57,700
Dude, you know what I'm so sad about?

5453
04:13:57,880 --> 04:14:00,760
They fixed the infinite money glitch from September.

5454
04:14:01,860 --> 04:14:08,960
If you had 70-30, you would profit 25 cents every single time you gift yourself 5 subs.

5455
04:14:09,120 --> 04:14:11,260
25 cents at least!

5456
04:14:12,260 --> 04:14:17,540
So then, if you got bonus subs more than one sub, you'd get even more money.

5457
04:14:18,060 --> 04:14:19,040
And they patched it.

5458
04:14:19,200 --> 04:14:21,680
You can't give subs to yourself anymore and farm infinite money.

5459
04:14:23,600 --> 04:14:24,760
It's so sad.

5460
04:14:26,100 --> 04:14:27,820
Alright, I'm trying out Adam.

5461
04:14:27,940 --> 04:14:29,320
Let's see how it goes.

5462
04:14:29,400 --> 04:14:30,580
Let's see how it goes with Adam.

5463
04:14:31,240 --> 04:14:34,160
I don't have, like, his...

5464
04:14:34,160 --> 04:14:34,380
Uh oh!

5465
04:14:35,140 --> 04:14:36,040
You're fine.

5466
04:14:37,640 --> 04:14:38,620
They portaled somewhere?

5467
04:14:39,580 --> 04:14:40,620
I don't have soul link yet.

5468
04:14:45,960 --> 04:14:47,520
Oh my god.

5469
04:14:48,100 --> 04:14:48,800
No heals on point.

5470
04:14:50,480 --> 04:14:51,780
I'm setting up a turret.

5471
04:14:51,940 --> 04:14:52,520
It's okay.

5472
04:14:53,940 --> 04:14:55,340
I'm charging it up.

5473
04:14:57,660 --> 04:14:58,260
Ho ho!

5474
04:14:58,540 --> 04:14:59,060
Fuck!

5475
04:14:59,180 --> 04:14:59,440
Okay.

5476
04:15:01,080 --> 04:15:02,820
I just accidentally pressed E.

5477
04:15:02,900 --> 04:15:03,120
Whoops.

5478
04:15:05,940 --> 04:15:07,560
Guys, I'm, like, a little scared.

5479
04:15:10,500 --> 04:15:13,440
Oh, I got shit on.

5480
04:15:15,300 --> 04:15:17,120
I don't have heals at all.

5481
04:15:18,160 --> 04:15:20,400
Oh, but, like, I can spawn in.

5482
04:15:20,560 --> 04:15:20,800
Okay.

5483
04:15:21,180 --> 04:15:22,520
I should not have cocoon.

5484
04:15:25,740 --> 04:15:27,320
Yo, plus one death?

5485
04:15:27,620 --> 04:15:28,260
Let's go!

5486
04:15:29,980 --> 04:15:31,520
I should not have hooked you.

5487
04:15:31,620 --> 04:15:33,160
I thought I could stall on point.

5488
04:15:33,440 --> 04:15:35,640
Alright, I'll swap off after my ult soon.

5489
04:15:36,980 --> 04:15:37,360
Uh oh.

5490
04:15:40,280 --> 04:15:41,760
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

5491
04:15:43,000 --> 04:15:43,440
Okay.

5492
04:15:43,900 --> 04:15:46,480
I'll wait for all of us before I do a soul bond.

5493
04:15:46,820 --> 04:15:48,060
Oh, he's so low!

5494
04:15:50,200 --> 04:15:50,960
Are you okay?

5495
04:15:51,440 --> 04:15:51,780
No.

5496
04:15:52,720 --> 04:15:54,980
I missed my E on the fucking Punisher.

5497
04:15:56,900 --> 04:15:57,120
Oh!

5498
04:15:57,480 --> 04:15:57,780
Oh!

5499
04:15:58,340 --> 04:15:58,860
What?

5500
04:15:59,760 --> 04:16:01,000
What is this?

5501
04:16:01,800 --> 04:16:02,360
Are we fighting?

5502
04:16:03,300 --> 04:16:03,800
I guess.

5503
04:16:03,980 --> 04:16:04,880
Our tanks just went through.

5504
04:16:09,560 --> 04:16:10,800
And we reset.

5505
04:16:11,500 --> 04:16:12,160
Oh, we reset?

5506
04:16:12,400 --> 04:16:12,720
Okay.

5507
04:16:13,640 --> 04:16:15,680
Okay, that's bad.

5508
04:16:16,140 --> 04:16:17,360
Wait, no, wait, we win these!

5509
04:16:18,040 --> 04:16:20,660
I'm getting just gunned down by an AA gun.

5510
04:16:21,240 --> 04:16:22,180
Alright, I swapped.

5511
04:16:22,560 --> 04:16:26,480
I guess Look, Adam is not it.

5512
04:16:28,300 --> 04:16:28,960
Oh.

5513
04:16:29,300 --> 04:16:32,720
I legitimately thought we could make Adam work because it's meta.

5514
04:16:35,400 --> 04:16:38,120
But it could be me not knowing how to play Adam.

5515
04:16:38,360 --> 04:16:38,820
Who knows?

5516
04:16:39,040 --> 04:16:41,600
I have my Punisher ult.

5517
04:16:42,980 --> 04:16:44,360
Dude, okay.

5518
04:16:44,880 --> 04:16:45,160
Okay.

5519
04:16:46,100 --> 04:16:47,220
The Mantis ulted.

5520
04:16:47,760 --> 04:16:50,260
I get shit on.

5521
04:16:52,900 --> 04:16:53,780
Strange Ironman.

5522
04:16:53,800 --> 04:16:54,340
I killed Punisher.

5523
04:16:54,840 --> 04:16:56,500
Yeah, but we're down, we're down.

5524
04:16:57,520 --> 04:16:59,540
We have one... I don't know.

5525
04:16:59,760 --> 04:17:01,580
I don't know if we can get a fight in.

5526
04:17:02,320 --> 04:17:02,660
No.

5527
04:17:05,080 --> 04:17:05,520
Stop.

5528
04:17:06,960 --> 04:17:07,720
What do we do?

5529
04:17:10,600 --> 04:17:12,600
Well, we have a Punisher now to shoot.

5530
04:17:13,740 --> 04:17:15,300
Wait, can you play Starlord?

5531
04:17:15,580 --> 04:17:17,100
Starlord is a great counter to Adam.

5532
04:17:17,640 --> 04:17:18,840
I can get a summon.

5533
04:17:19,220 --> 04:17:20,080
Are we able to touch?

5534
04:17:20,480 --> 04:17:21,320
No, I don't think so.

5535
04:17:21,460 --> 04:17:25,380
I think if we shut down the Ironman with Starlord Punisher, then like...

5536
04:17:25,380 --> 04:17:32,600
I think the biggest problem that round is just we kept staggering in and like, losing ults when like, nobody's there.

5537
04:17:32,800 --> 04:17:34,160
Like our guy.

5538
04:17:34,460 --> 04:17:35,240
Our strange guy.

5539
04:17:35,780 --> 04:17:37,920
He went and ulted when it was just two of them there.

5540
04:17:40,560 --> 04:17:42,220
He's just trying his best.

5541
04:17:42,940 --> 04:17:43,580
Yeah, no.

5542
04:17:43,720 --> 04:17:45,380
He's gonna do his best this round.

5543
04:17:45,380 --> 04:17:46,480
And then we win.

5544
04:17:46,620 --> 04:17:48,340
Trying his best.

5545
04:17:49,220 --> 04:17:53,560
We're just not gonna die so that we can't stagger in the first place and then there's no problems.

5546
04:17:54,020 --> 04:17:54,500
Yeah.

5547
04:17:55,580 --> 04:17:56,180
Yeah.

5548
04:17:58,640 --> 04:18:02,580
Would I be a Turbo Griefer if I picked Widow here?

5549
04:18:02,840 --> 04:18:03,200
Yes.

5550
04:18:07,160 --> 04:18:10,120
I mean, that's a pretty decent point for it.

5551
04:18:11,980 --> 04:18:12,440
Okay.

5552
04:18:13,160 --> 04:18:15,720
Just so you know, I'm not Mantis so you gotta ask.

5553
04:18:15,960 --> 04:18:17,820
You have to ask the Mantis for damage boost.

5554
04:18:18,400 --> 04:18:20,040
Mantis, just pocket me a little bit.

5555
04:18:20,440 --> 04:18:21,300
I'll get a fix at the beginning.

5556
04:18:21,480 --> 04:18:23,600
Can Widow get damage boosted?

5557
04:18:23,760 --> 04:18:24,000
Yes.

5558
04:18:24,380 --> 04:18:25,260
She one shots.

5559
04:18:25,860 --> 04:18:26,300
Really?

5560
04:18:26,580 --> 04:18:26,800
Yeah.

5561
04:18:27,160 --> 04:18:29,920
That's why like, Widow players only play if there's a Mantis.

5562
04:18:30,280 --> 04:18:32,660
Because she can actually one shot and like, kill people.

5563
04:18:34,320 --> 04:18:35,420
Okay, they're all top right.

5564
04:18:37,680 --> 04:18:39,120
Are you getting damage boosted?

5565
04:18:39,120 --> 04:18:40,600
I can't tell.

5566
04:18:41,860 --> 04:18:43,240
Oh my god.

5567
04:18:43,260 --> 04:18:44,760
I just got ran at by this range.

5568
04:18:46,340 --> 04:18:47,460
I got...

5569
04:18:47,460 --> 04:18:48,980
I'm backing out.

5570
04:18:49,300 --> 04:18:51,060
The hog literally ulted into us.

5571
04:18:52,000 --> 04:18:52,560
Goodbye!

5572
04:18:54,020 --> 04:18:54,880
Oh Jesus.

5573
04:18:55,280 --> 04:18:57,300
I don't think he's gonna live.

5574
04:18:59,140 --> 04:18:59,700
Okay.

5575
04:19:00,560 --> 04:19:01,700
You guys are about to get ran at.

5576
04:19:04,620 --> 04:19:06,320
Oh, their punish is so low.

5577
04:19:09,600 --> 04:19:10,800
Okay, we're fine.

5578
04:19:12,160 --> 04:19:13,860
Yeah, I have my punish going for this fight.

5579
04:19:14,980 --> 04:19:16,740
We have a strange...

5580
04:19:16,740 --> 04:19:18,020
Not strange, we have a captain.

5581
04:19:18,180 --> 04:19:19,060
I killed the Ironman.

5582
04:19:19,940 --> 04:19:20,400
Nice!

5583
04:19:21,240 --> 04:19:21,800
I got you.

5584
04:19:22,760 --> 04:19:26,900
Alright, Captain America is fucking going at it.

5585
04:19:29,060 --> 04:19:31,020
I'm trying to keep our Captain America alive.

5586
04:19:34,260 --> 04:19:34,720
Mantis one.

5587
04:19:34,720 --> 04:19:36,000
Change this half, change this half, change this half.

5588
04:19:36,000 --> 04:19:37,280
I forced Mantis ult.

5589
04:19:40,840 --> 04:19:42,100
I might be dead.

5590
04:19:43,240 --> 04:19:44,460
Oh, please.

5591
04:19:44,760 --> 04:19:45,420
I'm so dead.

5592
04:19:45,480 --> 04:19:46,220
I'm so dead here.

5593
04:19:47,480 --> 04:19:47,900
Yeah.

5594
04:19:49,440 --> 04:19:50,400
Kill Mantis.

5595
04:19:50,540 --> 04:19:51,100
Oh, that's huge.

5596
04:19:51,660 --> 04:19:52,300
I couldn't.

5597
04:19:52,400 --> 04:19:52,840
Oh my god.

5598
04:19:52,900 --> 04:19:54,560
Four people ran at me.

5599
04:19:57,760 --> 04:19:58,640
I think our...

5600
04:19:58,640 --> 04:20:00,840
I think...

5601
04:20:00,840 --> 04:20:03,200
Our kicks are not having it.

5602
04:20:06,000 --> 04:20:06,280
Mantis one.

5603
04:20:07,240 --> 04:20:09,280
I'm keeping you up, Mac.

5604
04:20:12,300 --> 04:20:12,860
Nice!

5605
04:20:13,320 --> 04:20:15,040
We should push up with that.

5606
04:20:15,140 --> 04:20:15,680
Just fight on point.

5607
04:20:16,320 --> 04:20:17,120
I'm coming back.

5608
04:20:18,520 --> 04:20:19,000
Where is it?

5609
04:20:21,960 --> 04:20:23,080
He was...

5610
04:20:23,080 --> 04:20:24,440
He was trying something.

5611
04:20:26,680 --> 04:20:28,260
I'm gonna ult on point.

5612
04:20:28,760 --> 04:20:30,240
If we get engaged on.

5613
04:20:31,840 --> 04:20:33,700
Guys, this is...

5614
04:20:33,700 --> 04:20:35,720
They have strength and iron mantle.

5615
04:20:36,800 --> 04:20:37,580
They're gonna do that combo.

5616
04:20:40,200 --> 04:20:41,540
I'm trying to wake...

5617
04:20:41,540 --> 04:20:43,320
My auto attack doesn't wake people up.

5618
04:20:43,600 --> 04:20:44,120
My bad.

5619
04:20:44,380 --> 04:20:45,140
I didn't know you were there.

5620
04:20:45,180 --> 04:20:47,180
Okay, I guess I use this then.

5621
04:20:49,000 --> 04:20:49,560
Just in case.

5622
04:20:50,600 --> 04:20:52,060
I'm getting hard ran at by Hulk right now.

5623
04:20:52,060 --> 04:20:52,360
Yeah, yeah.

5624
04:20:52,440 --> 04:20:53,580
I can't do anything about it.

5625
04:20:54,380 --> 04:20:55,240
He stunned me.

5626
04:20:55,520 --> 04:20:56,360
Hulk behind you guys.

5627
04:20:56,620 --> 04:20:58,060
I'm healing you.

5628
04:20:59,500 --> 04:21:00,840
I come back with punish roll.

5629
04:21:00,840 --> 04:21:01,860
This is winnable.

5630
04:21:02,580 --> 04:21:04,160
The Hulk is back.

5631
04:21:06,600 --> 04:21:08,460
I'm getting solo ulted by Strange.

5632
04:21:08,600 --> 04:21:09,140
What is this?

5633
04:21:09,760 --> 04:21:10,720
I'm okay.

5634
04:21:11,840 --> 04:21:14,700
I stayed on point for so long.

5635
04:21:14,840 --> 04:21:15,840
Guys, we have to fight on point.

5636
04:21:18,440 --> 04:21:19,540
Mantis is so low.

5637
04:21:23,800 --> 04:21:27,800
They're investing so many resources into trying to kill me.

5638
04:21:27,800 --> 04:21:30,320
Yeah, thinking you ran out.

5639
04:21:31,220 --> 04:21:31,800
Punisher one.

5640
04:21:35,020 --> 04:21:36,720
I'm coming back now.

5641
04:21:42,470 --> 04:21:45,070
I have to heal the tanks right now.

5642
04:21:47,670 --> 04:21:48,390
Please!

5643
04:21:52,540 --> 04:21:54,680
What the fuck where did I get hit from?

5644
04:21:59,580 --> 04:22:03,200
Wait, Iron Man's projectiles go through walls?

5645
04:22:03,780 --> 04:22:06,420
No, they blow a hole in the wall the first one.

5646
04:22:06,600 --> 04:22:07,260
Wait, what?

5647
04:22:07,480 --> 04:22:09,440
He literally shot me through the wall.

5648
04:22:10,180 --> 04:22:11,040
Splash damage.

5649
04:22:12,040 --> 04:22:13,720
Oh yeah, they splash.

5650
04:22:14,060 --> 04:22:14,740
Yay, okay.

5651
04:22:19,940 --> 04:22:20,980
Got you.

5652
04:22:21,200 --> 04:22:22,420
As best as I could.

5653
04:22:26,500 --> 04:22:28,220
I mean, I have support ults too.

5654
04:22:31,830 --> 04:22:33,490
I'm just gonna stay with you.

5655
04:22:33,790 --> 04:22:35,530
Oh my god!

5656
04:22:35,650 --> 04:22:36,010
Okay.

5657
04:22:37,070 --> 04:22:37,890
Okay.

5658
04:22:43,830 --> 04:22:48,770
I think it was just a tank stiff.

5659
04:22:49,230 --> 04:22:49,870
Yeah.

5660
04:22:49,890 --> 04:22:51,350
I think.

5661
04:22:51,830 --> 04:22:54,330
I think it was just tank stiff.

5662
04:22:56,570 --> 04:22:57,890
Oh man.

5663
04:23:02,970 --> 04:23:05,450
Their tanks just freely walked up to us.

5664
04:23:05,810 --> 04:23:10,010
Yeah, they were like, I don't know what to do there.

5665
04:23:11,650 --> 04:23:15,030
It did help that when Adam first fight, but...

5666
04:23:16,590 --> 04:23:17,790
And we lost 19.

5667
04:23:18,010 --> 04:23:18,490
I'm not mad.

5668
04:23:19,190 --> 04:23:20,470
He lost 19?

5669
04:23:21,590 --> 04:23:22,110
Yeah.

5670
04:23:22,550 --> 04:23:23,370
I lost 21.

5671
04:23:24,670 --> 04:23:26,730
Damn, get fucked.

5672
04:23:27,970 --> 04:23:30,970
Um, I have you know, I invited you to this...

5673
04:23:30,970 --> 04:23:33,710
I was supposed to be invited to this stack and I can kick you out whenever I want.

5674
04:23:33,850 --> 04:23:35,270
I just wanted to remind you that.

5675
04:23:35,530 --> 04:23:35,990
No!

5676
04:23:39,530 --> 04:23:41,650
I just wanted to remind you that you're the plus one here.

5677
04:23:42,730 --> 04:23:43,190
Fuck!

5678
04:23:46,450 --> 04:23:46,910
Listen.

5679
04:23:48,010 --> 04:23:48,810
Winstreak time.

5680
04:23:50,170 --> 04:23:53,850
Look, Mac literally gave up playing with xQc to play with me.

5681
04:23:54,710 --> 04:23:56,070
Oh my god.

5682
04:23:57,810 --> 04:23:58,510
Holy shit.

5683
04:23:58,510 --> 04:24:00,390
He's gonna eat me.

5684
04:24:01,290 --> 04:24:03,450
That's my fucking goat right there.

5685
04:24:04,330 --> 04:24:05,130
Okay, watch.

5686
04:24:05,750 --> 04:24:07,170
They don't ban Psylocke.

5687
04:24:07,570 --> 04:24:08,690
They're not gonna do it.

5688
04:24:08,950 --> 04:24:14,890
We ban Hawkeye and then I play Psylocke.

5689
04:24:16,590 --> 04:24:17,170
Cool.

5690
04:24:18,150 --> 04:24:21,210
Anytime you get to play Psylocke, you can actually play the game.

5691
04:24:21,990 --> 04:24:23,770
I can play the game even if I'm not on Psylocke.

5692
04:24:23,770 --> 04:24:25,310
Typical Psylocke player.

5693
04:24:25,310 --> 04:24:28,550
I am obsessively addicted to Marvel Rivals.

5694
04:24:28,690 --> 04:24:29,650
I'm just trying to get it back.

5695
04:24:30,770 --> 04:24:31,990
I'm just trying to get it back.

5696
04:24:32,830 --> 04:24:33,470
That's a good ban.

5697
04:24:34,530 --> 04:24:35,350
I'm banning Hulk.

5698
04:24:36,870 --> 04:24:37,570
Ah, shit.

5699
04:24:42,000 --> 04:24:43,080
Doki, ban Hulk.

5700
04:24:43,560 --> 04:24:44,740
Wait, I ban Hulk?

5701
04:24:45,440 --> 04:24:46,180
Ban Hulk.

5702
04:24:46,580 --> 04:24:48,260
Make it 50-50.

5703
04:24:49,700 --> 04:24:51,840
I always lose coin flips, so Hela will get banned.

5704
04:24:52,700 --> 04:24:55,240
Oh, they ban Hela.

5705
04:24:55,240 --> 04:24:56,440
Hela's banned anyways.

5706
04:24:59,500 --> 04:25:02,420
I'm not a one trick.

5707
04:25:02,600 --> 04:25:04,380
I'm just sad when I'm not on Psylocke.

5708
04:25:04,520 --> 04:25:06,280
Everyone else is so much less fun.

5709
04:25:08,380 --> 04:25:09,460
You should try to learn magic.

5710
04:25:10,400 --> 04:25:11,460
This character is hella fun.

5711
04:25:11,960 --> 04:25:12,660
I should.

5712
04:25:13,600 --> 04:25:15,760
I like how you lied and said, I don't tank.

5713
04:25:18,860 --> 04:25:21,060
Dude, I'm just so sick of tanking.

5714
04:25:21,400 --> 04:25:23,000
I like how you lied.

5715
04:25:23,000 --> 04:25:24,960
What do you mean?

5716
04:25:25,140 --> 04:25:26,700
You barely tanked today.

5717
04:25:28,880 --> 04:25:31,440
I tanked so much the past few days.

5718
04:25:35,480 --> 04:25:37,640
I don't know.

5719
04:25:37,720 --> 04:25:38,720
I was too nice yesterday.

5720
04:25:38,960 --> 04:25:40,720
You were way too nice.

5721
04:25:40,780 --> 04:25:42,500
You literally played fucking support.

5722
04:25:42,720 --> 04:25:43,640
What was wrong with you?

5723
04:25:43,840 --> 04:25:45,540
I was playing Rocket and shit, man.

5724
04:25:46,280 --> 04:25:47,840
This is why we don't climb.

5725
04:25:49,120 --> 04:25:50,780
You're not greedy enough.

5726
04:25:50,780 --> 04:25:52,060
You're not selfish enough.

5727
04:25:52,400 --> 04:25:53,080
You're right.

5728
04:25:53,500 --> 04:25:57,060
I don't fucking care if we have two other support mains.

5729
04:25:57,140 --> 04:25:58,200
I still lock in support.

5730
04:25:59,980 --> 04:26:01,840
You gotta ego the other people.

5731
04:26:01,960 --> 04:26:02,980
You have to ego.

5732
04:26:03,320 --> 04:26:06,080
See, who's more desperate for fucking points?

5733
04:26:06,680 --> 04:26:07,340
You or them.

5734
04:26:08,340 --> 04:26:09,560
Definitely not me.

5735
04:26:10,320 --> 04:26:11,900
You have the insta-lock.

5736
04:26:12,020 --> 04:26:12,680
Who the fuck cares?

5737
04:26:13,100 --> 04:26:13,940
You know you're better.

5738
04:26:15,740 --> 04:26:16,700
I guess not.

5739
04:26:17,480 --> 04:26:18,480
I'm just walking.

5740
04:26:21,060 --> 04:26:21,960
Is the bridge open?

5741
04:26:22,840 --> 04:26:23,680
I don't fucking know.

5742
04:26:24,100 --> 04:26:24,740
Yeah, they're main.

5743
04:26:25,780 --> 04:26:26,920
They have Punisher.

5744
04:26:28,500 --> 04:26:30,700
They have Punisher and they're main right now.

5745
04:26:31,220 --> 04:26:31,580
Okay.

5746
04:26:33,060 --> 04:26:34,820
I'm gonna see if I can one-shot one.

5747
04:26:36,280 --> 04:26:38,200
I'm not one-shotting one, but I did kill their Rez.

5748
04:26:39,000 --> 04:26:40,160
I'm with you.

5749
04:26:42,500 --> 04:26:44,380
There's a Psylocke behind!

5750
04:26:44,380 --> 04:26:45,180
Sword us!

5751
04:26:46,180 --> 04:26:47,840
Oh, I knocked him over the fucking group wall.

5752
04:26:48,680 --> 04:26:50,720
Okay, he doesn't die then.

5753
04:26:52,680 --> 04:26:53,720
I'm playing on point.

5754
04:26:54,420 --> 04:26:55,400
I'm looking at point.

5755
04:26:55,560 --> 04:26:56,440
Psylocke's still behind.

5756
04:26:57,920 --> 04:26:59,160
I have to walk off.

5757
04:27:01,080 --> 04:27:02,100
There's Psylocke still behind.

5758
04:27:02,380 --> 04:27:04,680
And the Punisher's just reshooting me.

5759
04:27:07,500 --> 04:27:08,940
Psylocke has Orb on.

5760
04:27:13,190 --> 04:27:13,750
Where's our tank?

5761
04:27:13,750 --> 04:27:14,710
Oh, our tank's dead.

5762
04:27:16,210 --> 04:27:16,890
Psylocke behind!

5763
04:27:17,010 --> 04:27:17,770
Psylocke behind again!

5764
04:27:22,680 --> 04:27:24,220
Can you keep snowflake on me, Ducky?

5765
04:27:24,460 --> 04:27:25,100
Yeah, I can.

5766
04:27:28,440 --> 04:27:29,700
Our tanks are here.

5767
04:27:39,320 --> 04:27:40,780
There's someone on the right.

5768
04:27:41,020 --> 04:27:42,040
There's a rocket on the right.

5769
04:27:43,420 --> 04:27:45,600
Oh my god, Psylocke's so low!

5770
04:27:47,160 --> 04:27:48,200
I'm back, I'm back.

5771
04:27:49,540 --> 04:27:50,220
I have ult here.

5772
04:27:50,960 --> 04:27:52,100
I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

5773
04:27:54,420 --> 04:27:55,380
I'm dancing!

5774
04:27:56,080 --> 04:27:57,820
I'm gonna dance!

5775
04:27:58,800 --> 04:28:00,900
Please kill them while I dance!

5776
04:28:01,840 --> 04:28:02,360
Kill this...

5777
04:28:02,360 --> 04:28:03,500
Strange is low, Strange is low.

5778
04:28:06,440 --> 04:28:07,440
I have to reload, I have to reload.

5779
04:28:08,080 --> 04:28:09,040
She's one!

5780
04:28:09,420 --> 04:28:11,460
I had to reload my hands!

5781
04:28:12,000 --> 04:28:12,480
No!

5782
04:28:12,480 --> 04:28:13,040
No!

5783
04:28:13,260 --> 04:28:15,620
Why don't you have infinite ammo in your hands?

5784
04:28:16,560 --> 04:28:17,300
I don't know.

5785
04:28:17,880 --> 04:28:21,000
Honestly, we should have more infinite ammo in our hands.

5786
04:28:21,800 --> 04:28:24,340
Yeah, Groot has to reload his arms like a fucking boxer.

5787
04:28:24,400 --> 04:28:25,020
Yeah, like what the fuck?

5788
04:28:25,140 --> 04:28:27,240
And then Jeff has to eat to reload water?

5789
04:28:27,420 --> 04:28:28,660
Like, what the fuck does that mean?

5790
04:28:29,300 --> 04:28:30,320
Nah, that makes sense.

5791
04:28:30,460 --> 04:28:31,440
How does that make sense?

5792
04:28:31,520 --> 04:28:32,740
Where does he get the water?

5793
04:28:33,940 --> 04:28:35,740
How does he swim in the ground?

5794
04:28:36,420 --> 04:28:37,860
Cause he's a magic shark.

5795
04:28:38,640 --> 04:28:39,480
Magic shark?

5796
04:28:39,480 --> 04:28:40,000
Fuck.

5797
04:28:41,300 --> 04:28:46,320
Um, I can't peek that because I have...

5798
04:28:46,320 --> 04:28:47,680
Wait, he's low.

5799
04:28:47,900 --> 04:28:48,420
In there.

5800
04:28:49,840 --> 04:28:51,480
Psylocke behind me, Psylocke behind me.

5801
04:28:51,600 --> 04:28:53,100
He's gonna...

5802
04:28:53,100 --> 04:28:53,700
Goodbye.

5803
04:28:55,460 --> 04:28:56,640
Oh no, what the?

5804
04:28:56,800 --> 04:28:58,580
Thank you for healing me.

5805
04:28:58,600 --> 04:29:00,100
Their raccoon is so low.

5806
04:29:01,320 --> 04:29:02,520
Psylocke got nobody with it.

5807
04:29:04,280 --> 04:29:05,040
Yeah, what a bum.

5808
04:29:05,040 --> 04:29:05,760
Couldn't beat me.

5809
04:29:05,760 --> 04:29:05,900
Couldn't beat me.

5810
04:29:07,780 --> 04:29:09,040
I don't know where the Psylocke went.

5811
04:29:09,080 --> 04:29:10,120
She went invisible again.

5812
04:29:12,540 --> 04:29:13,800
I'm playing up.

5813
04:29:13,940 --> 04:29:15,760
But the tanks aren't taking damage, so...

5814
04:29:16,500 --> 04:29:16,700
Yeah.

5815
04:29:18,540 --> 04:29:20,100
Chunk the shit out of Thor, there.

5816
04:29:20,800 --> 04:29:21,520
Portaling to my right.

5817
04:29:21,760 --> 04:29:22,480
Portaling, portaling.

5818
04:29:23,760 --> 04:29:24,960
Watch for eye, watch for eye.

5819
04:29:30,710 --> 04:29:31,110
Um...

5820
04:29:31,110 --> 04:29:33,170
I don't think...

5821
04:29:33,170 --> 04:29:34,350
We live this.

5822
04:29:34,350 --> 04:29:35,710
I'm frozen too.

5823
04:29:37,090 --> 04:29:38,330
We don't live it.

5824
04:29:38,470 --> 04:29:39,670
We both support are down.

5825
04:29:39,970 --> 04:29:42,350
No, I got shotgunned.

5826
04:29:43,830 --> 04:29:44,910
He's a land shark.

5827
04:29:45,350 --> 04:29:45,790
Exactly!

5828
04:29:46,150 --> 04:29:47,390
He's a magic shark!

5829
04:29:48,370 --> 04:29:49,110
I got...

5830
04:29:49,110 --> 04:29:51,290
I have ult for this fight.

5831
04:29:52,150 --> 04:29:53,190
Okay, that's good, that's good.

5832
04:29:53,390 --> 04:29:56,630
They don't have Psylocke ult, so I'll just engage with it.

5833
04:29:57,230 --> 04:29:57,730
Okay, okay.

5834
04:29:58,370 --> 04:30:01,110
And they use strange ult, so they literally have no DPS ults.

5835
04:30:02,670 --> 04:30:03,290
Oh wait, no.

5836
04:30:03,350 --> 04:30:04,750
They have punish ult, so... I don't know.

5837
04:30:07,030 --> 04:30:08,630
Oh my god, I got nuked by an RFC.

5838
04:30:08,630 --> 04:30:09,290
Oh my god.

5839
04:30:14,920 --> 04:30:16,020
We have to wait, then.

5840
04:30:21,450 --> 04:30:22,710
Wait, this is so chill.

5841
04:30:22,790 --> 04:30:23,350
We can just wait.

5842
04:30:23,590 --> 04:30:25,550
Oh, but we lost Groot, we lost Groot.

5843
04:30:27,870 --> 04:30:28,590
Oh, fuck!

5844
04:30:28,650 --> 04:30:28,950
Okay!

5845
04:30:30,070 --> 04:30:31,070
I guess we go.

5846
04:30:31,330 --> 04:30:32,490
I guess we go in.

5847
04:30:32,490 --> 04:30:33,930
And I ult Groot.

5848
04:30:35,650 --> 04:30:36,570
That was...

5849
04:30:36,570 --> 04:30:38,010
That was ambitious.

5850
04:30:38,570 --> 04:30:41,630
Yeah, I'm ulting on point if you want kills.

5851
04:30:42,670 --> 04:30:43,130
Coming back.

5852
04:30:43,870 --> 04:30:44,870
I have no more ult.

5853
04:30:46,370 --> 04:30:47,190
Strange is low.

5854
04:30:49,250 --> 04:30:50,550
Psylocke is low, Psylocke is low.

5855
04:30:50,650 --> 04:30:51,110
Psylocke one.

5856
04:30:52,730 --> 04:30:53,370
Strange, strange, strange.

5857
04:30:55,570 --> 04:30:56,030
Please.

5858
04:30:59,050 --> 04:31:00,330
Luna to the left, Luna to the left.

5859
04:31:01,850 --> 04:31:03,330
He's trying to run away.

5860
04:31:03,470 --> 04:31:04,550
Oh, goodbye Luna.

5861
04:31:06,470 --> 04:31:07,250
Okay, that's huge.

5862
04:31:08,870 --> 04:31:09,610
I want to cut.

5863
04:31:09,710 --> 04:31:10,810
I want to cut all trees.

5864
04:31:12,450 --> 04:31:13,970
I want to burn them all down.

5865
04:31:13,970 --> 04:31:15,250
Yeah, I want to burn all the trees down.

5866
04:31:15,270 --> 04:31:18,810
Oh my god, Human Torch should absolutely do bonus damage to Groot.

5867
04:31:18,810 --> 04:31:22,070
Oh my god, that's why I didn't release Human Torch.

5868
04:31:22,990 --> 04:31:26,310
It should do like times five bonus damage to Groot only.

5869
04:31:26,610 --> 04:31:27,010
Yes!

5870
04:31:27,690 --> 04:31:29,490
Human Torch looks at Thor and he just incinerates.

5871
04:31:29,490 --> 04:31:32,190
You only play Human Torch if there's a Groot player.

5872
04:31:33,710 --> 04:31:36,870
If you're a Groot player, you're just about to ban Human Torch every game.

5873
04:31:37,190 --> 04:31:38,750
Please, Groot, I want to play Groot.

5874
04:31:39,710 --> 04:31:41,850
Please, I don't want to get burned down.

5875
04:31:41,990 --> 04:31:45,790
Yeah, but then that wastes a ban slot.

5876
04:31:47,230 --> 04:31:47,670
True.

5877
04:31:48,790 --> 04:31:54,150
Literally, a Groot one trick is throwing the entire game just because he's wasting an avoid slot.

5878
04:31:54,150 --> 04:31:54,990
You're right.

5879
04:31:55,670 --> 04:31:59,750
Do you think they're going to nerf Hela in any meaningful way?

5880
04:32:00,650 --> 04:32:01,750
I don't think they're going to nerf them.

5881
04:32:01,750 --> 04:32:03,610
I think they're only going to nerf them after Season 1.

5882
04:32:03,790 --> 04:32:06,230
I don't think they're touching the characters until then.

5883
04:32:06,730 --> 04:32:07,830
When does Season 1 even start?

5884
04:32:08,550 --> 04:32:08,950
January.

5885
04:32:09,510 --> 04:32:10,430
January something.

5886
04:32:10,810 --> 04:32:11,750
I just know it's in January.

5887
04:32:12,910 --> 04:32:15,010
Maybe like first or second week of January.

5888
04:32:15,810 --> 04:32:16,690
No, fuck Groot.

5889
04:32:16,770 --> 04:32:17,870
I don't care about Groot.

5890
04:32:18,710 --> 04:32:20,730
Groot is actually like hell.

5891
04:32:21,930 --> 04:32:25,390
A good Groot and a good Hulk is like terrible play again.

5892
04:32:28,730 --> 04:32:30,110
Oh my god, that's huge!

5893
04:32:31,370 --> 04:32:32,510
That's actually huge!

5894
04:32:33,450 --> 04:32:34,950
I'm fucking dead here though.

5895
04:32:38,010 --> 04:32:39,190
We're up one.

5896
04:32:39,630 --> 04:32:40,150
Okay, never mind.

5897
04:32:40,450 --> 04:32:43,410
How did everybody die?

5898
04:32:44,550 --> 04:32:47,250
I was just hitting that penny the whole time and she just wouldn't die.

5899
04:32:47,790 --> 04:32:49,230
That was such a huge ult.

5900
04:32:49,370 --> 04:32:50,010
That was crazy.

5901
04:32:50,830 --> 04:32:52,130
I'm coming back now.

5902
04:32:53,250 --> 04:32:54,570
I can't hear you, Ruben.

5903
04:32:55,070 --> 04:32:57,150
I thought they would just forget about me.

5904
04:32:57,450 --> 04:32:59,650
I couldn't heal you, Ruben.

5905
04:33:00,690 --> 04:33:01,370
That's okay.

5906
04:33:01,390 --> 04:33:02,350
I got my value.

5907
04:33:05,110 --> 04:33:05,590
What?

5908
04:33:06,150 --> 04:33:07,550
We lost the point.

5909
04:33:09,630 --> 04:33:10,910
I got my one.

5910
04:33:11,150 --> 04:33:12,070
I did my job.

5911
04:33:12,190 --> 04:33:12,630
Right, guys?

5912
04:33:12,710 --> 04:33:13,550
That's how it works.

5913
04:33:13,710 --> 04:33:14,290
Team shooter.

5914
04:33:14,990 --> 04:33:16,290
We lost the point.

5915
04:33:17,830 --> 04:33:21,790
I don't have a snowflake on you, Mac.

5916
04:33:22,590 --> 04:33:23,530
It's okay.

5917
04:33:26,590 --> 04:33:28,610
I'm gonna go contest penny with you.

5918
04:33:29,570 --> 04:33:30,290
I'm portaling in.

5919
04:33:31,350 --> 04:33:32,670
Oh, it's rude.

5920
04:33:32,930 --> 04:33:35,550
I had to reload in that moment.

5921
04:33:37,530 --> 04:33:39,170
Oh my god, strange!

5922
04:33:39,870 --> 04:33:42,730
Why, strange, why are you like this?

5923
04:33:45,150 --> 04:33:48,610
Why are you like this, strange?

5924
04:33:48,730 --> 04:33:51,190
I'm breaking all the mines as much as I can.

5925
04:33:52,350 --> 04:33:54,070
That's a huge ult.

5926
04:33:56,030 --> 04:33:58,630
I didn't want my E to hit the penny, so I didn't E there.

5927
04:34:02,690 --> 04:34:04,070
We should regroup.

5928
04:34:05,190 --> 04:34:07,110
I cannot believe that hit me.

5929
04:34:10,990 --> 04:34:12,350
Oh my god, group, please.

5930
04:34:12,350 --> 04:34:14,310
I killed Psylocke.

5931
04:34:14,470 --> 04:34:16,510
Nice, but we need a reset though.

5932
04:34:17,590 --> 04:34:21,450
Our tanks are not... our group is feeding really hard.

5933
04:34:22,350 --> 04:34:23,810
Or he got hooked, who knows.

5934
04:34:24,230 --> 04:34:24,890
I'm hiding.

5935
04:34:25,070 --> 04:34:28,470
Nah, he's been doing that until he locks in this fight.

5936
04:34:30,190 --> 04:34:32,150
He missed the hook, there's no hook.

5937
04:34:32,470 --> 04:34:34,130
Are you serious?

5938
04:34:35,830 --> 04:34:37,030
Guys, we...

5939
04:34:37,030 --> 04:34:40,390
Our other tank is not coming back to us.

5940
04:34:42,870 --> 04:34:44,230
He missed, he missed, he missed.

5941
04:34:45,370 --> 04:34:45,730
Huge.

5942
04:34:47,010 --> 04:34:49,370
I'm just gonna put the orb on the fucking Groot.

5943
04:34:49,610 --> 04:34:51,490
I don't think there's no other way to live.

5944
04:34:51,550 --> 04:34:52,210
Psylocke right.

5945
04:34:53,930 --> 04:34:54,990
Yeah, she's still right.

5946
04:34:55,970 --> 04:34:56,570
She's low.

5947
04:34:57,830 --> 04:34:59,790
Groot, please, for the love of god, Groot.

5948
04:34:59,930 --> 04:35:03,550
We only have like... wait, she's just for the Recon, Recon, kill the tank.

5949
04:35:05,550 --> 04:35:06,350
Guys, I...

5950
04:35:06,350 --> 04:35:07,730
I hate this Groot.

5951
04:35:07,850 --> 04:35:09,050
You gotta get the Recon.

5952
04:35:09,050 --> 04:35:11,330
I can't heal you.

5953
04:35:11,330 --> 04:35:11,750
I'm back.

5954
04:35:12,470 --> 04:35:13,510
I'm good, I'm good.

5955
04:35:16,350 --> 04:35:17,470
They have...

5956
04:35:17,470 --> 04:35:19,050
They have Bucky and...

5957
04:35:20,290 --> 04:35:22,810
Oh, yeah, okay.

5958
04:35:23,030 --> 04:35:23,870
Yeah, and they have Psylocke.

5959
04:35:24,070 --> 04:35:25,450
I don't have it yet.

5960
04:35:26,370 --> 04:35:27,270
I have it in 60.

5961
04:35:29,170 --> 04:35:30,810
This is fun, guys.

5962
04:35:31,090 --> 04:35:32,170
This is so fun.

5963
04:35:34,790 --> 04:35:36,570
I'm gonna break the Red's beacon.

5964
04:35:36,570 --> 04:35:37,890
Oh, my god.

5965
04:35:38,350 --> 04:35:39,270
Groot, please.

5966
04:35:39,810 --> 04:35:40,570
Top, top, top, top.

5967
04:35:40,890 --> 04:35:43,250
I just got one tapped.

5968
04:35:44,790 --> 04:35:45,310
What?

5969
04:35:46,070 --> 04:35:46,750
No Red's beacon?

5970
04:35:47,530 --> 04:35:48,890
I have to, I have to.

5971
04:35:48,930 --> 04:35:50,310
Oh, no, I didn't realize there.

5972
04:35:54,230 --> 04:35:56,330
They're gonna Psylocke the next fight.

5973
04:35:57,490 --> 04:35:58,610
The Psylocke is up top.

5974
04:36:00,010 --> 04:36:01,550
We used way too many ults there.

5975
04:36:02,530 --> 04:36:02,970
Shit.

5976
04:36:07,090 --> 04:36:07,490
Nice.

5977
04:36:07,670 --> 04:36:08,590
Okay, that's a stagger.

5978
04:36:08,930 --> 04:36:10,030
They have Psylocke.

5979
04:36:10,150 --> 04:36:12,050
They have all their DPS ults and support ult.

5980
04:36:12,130 --> 04:36:14,250
I don't know if they have Luna ult, right?

5981
04:36:14,630 --> 04:36:15,410
They haven't used it yet.

5982
04:36:15,650 --> 04:36:17,770
I think so.

5983
04:36:19,090 --> 04:36:20,190
Yeah, they haven't used it.

5984
04:36:20,290 --> 04:36:22,190
We have one fight after this, though.

5985
04:36:22,350 --> 04:36:23,790
I think, if we can portal it.

5986
04:36:24,670 --> 04:36:25,930
I'm gonna look to assassinate a support.

5987
04:36:27,550 --> 04:36:28,430
I know I'm here.

5988
04:36:30,450 --> 04:36:31,170
Thank you.

5989
04:36:31,170 --> 04:36:32,150
I need to keep fruit.

5990
04:36:32,370 --> 04:36:32,790
No!

5991
04:36:33,750 --> 04:36:34,490
Hold their Luna.

5992
04:36:37,450 --> 04:36:37,890
Please.

5993
04:36:42,730 --> 04:36:44,970
Oh, no, we're not gonna live through that.

5994
04:36:45,350 --> 04:36:46,270
We can portal.

5995
04:36:48,970 --> 04:36:49,930
Oh, no, we can't.

5996
04:36:49,970 --> 04:36:51,270
Our Strange didn't die.

5997
04:36:51,470 --> 04:36:53,050
I have portal, I have portal, I have portal.

5998
04:36:54,050 --> 04:36:55,490
Our Strange didn't die, though.

5999
04:36:56,130 --> 04:36:57,470
So, you might be a touch.

6000
04:36:57,970 --> 04:36:59,130
Yeah, I'm gonna try to go first.

6001
04:36:59,130 --> 04:37:00,350
I give you...

6002
04:37:00,350 --> 04:37:01,990
Yeah, our Strange didn't die.

6003
04:37:03,390 --> 04:37:04,990
It took 20 years to...

6004
04:37:04,990 --> 04:37:06,190
I have to be so quick.

6005
04:37:06,390 --> 04:37:08,210
I can touch, I can touch, I can touch.

6006
04:37:08,790 --> 04:37:10,590
Go in, go in, go in, go in, go in.

6007
04:37:11,170 --> 04:37:12,170
Where, where, where?

6008
04:37:13,250 --> 04:37:15,330
No way, he countered portal.

6009
04:37:16,990 --> 04:37:19,210
Oh, wait, no, they portaled us, they portaled us, they portaled us.

6010
04:37:20,190 --> 04:37:21,990
What do you mean they portaled us?

6011
04:37:22,110 --> 04:37:22,870
They countered portal.

6012
04:37:26,690 --> 04:37:27,850
I'm trying to stall on point.

6013
04:37:27,850 --> 04:37:28,790
No!

6014
04:37:29,730 --> 04:37:30,590
I got...

6015
04:37:33,520 --> 04:37:34,460
I killed Elena.

6016
04:37:34,780 --> 04:37:35,760
I got eyes, though.

6017
04:37:35,880 --> 04:37:36,040
No!

6018
04:37:39,460 --> 04:37:39,940
No!

6019
04:37:41,920 --> 04:37:42,860
Ah, shit.

6020
04:37:45,120 --> 04:37:46,220
Oh, my God.

6021
04:37:46,480 --> 04:37:49,700
Why did our Strange have to die last when he had portal?

6022
04:37:52,280 --> 04:37:52,760
Um...

6023
04:37:52,760 --> 04:37:54,400
We got ults for this fight.

6024
04:37:54,460 --> 04:37:55,460
What did they use that fight?

6025
04:37:56,460 --> 04:37:56,860
They...

6026
04:37:56,860 --> 04:37:57,620
I don't know.

6027
04:37:57,720 --> 04:37:58,420
They don't have portal.

6028
04:37:59,720 --> 04:38:00,280
That's true.

6029
04:38:01,680 --> 04:38:02,680
No, we don't either.

6030
04:38:03,120 --> 04:38:03,520
Fuck.

6031
04:38:07,470 --> 04:38:08,750
They used Penny ult.

6032
04:38:08,830 --> 04:38:09,670
That's all I can remember.

6033
04:38:10,530 --> 04:38:11,970
They have Raccoon ult here.

6034
04:38:12,490 --> 04:38:14,270
But that was actually...

6035
04:38:14,270 --> 04:38:18,610
They used Luna ult the second last fight.

6036
04:38:18,690 --> 04:38:19,570
So they might get it here.

6037
04:38:19,910 --> 04:38:20,770
Because I have my ult.

6038
04:38:21,690 --> 04:38:23,630
So they might get their ult after the first fight.

6039
04:38:25,330 --> 04:38:25,770
So...

6040
04:38:25,770 --> 04:38:26,810
I guess like...

6041
04:38:26,810 --> 04:38:28,170
Matt could just start the fight off.

6042
04:38:28,550 --> 04:38:29,850
And kill everybody off.

6043
04:38:29,910 --> 04:38:31,070
Because they don't have Luna ult.

6044
04:38:34,410 --> 04:38:35,010
Oh, my God.

6045
04:38:36,070 --> 04:38:37,290
Oh, my God.

6046
04:38:42,970 --> 04:38:43,990
I'm just keeping...

6047
04:38:43,990 --> 04:38:45,930
I need to keep the orb on our group.

6048
04:38:46,050 --> 04:38:47,030
Because all he does is feed.

6049
04:38:47,330 --> 04:38:49,170
I literally can't keep him alive.

6050
04:38:49,170 --> 04:38:51,310
This is a very rough map for Magic.

6051
04:38:51,630 --> 04:38:52,910
I'm probably going to ult and then swap.

6052
04:39:02,350 --> 04:39:04,070
I killed their Psylocke.

6053
04:39:05,570 --> 04:39:07,170
I'm trying to keep their...

6054
04:39:08,030 --> 04:39:09,790
Their Strange is frozen.

6055
04:39:15,370 --> 04:39:17,270
I'm fucking ulting.

6056
04:39:20,090 --> 04:39:20,910
And he does.

6057
04:39:21,330 --> 04:39:22,890
Oh, my God.

6058
04:39:28,230 --> 04:39:29,130
There we go.

6059
04:39:29,510 --> 04:39:31,930
I had to ult to keep everybody alive.

6060
04:39:32,150 --> 04:39:34,450
After I saw Groot fucking ass out.

6061
04:39:37,910 --> 04:39:39,870
Okay, we do have a Jeff.

6062
04:39:39,990 --> 04:39:42,270
So it's going to be a little difficult.

6063
04:39:42,770 --> 04:39:43,870
We have a Jeff?

6064
04:39:44,170 --> 04:39:44,950
Oh, shit.

6065
04:39:46,910 --> 04:39:47,950
Oh, no.

6066
04:39:49,090 --> 04:39:49,610
Wait.

6067
04:39:50,890 --> 04:39:51,490
Wait.

6068
04:39:51,490 --> 04:39:52,070
Unless...

6069
04:39:52,070 --> 04:39:52,830
I'm good.

6070
04:39:54,190 --> 04:39:55,490
Penny is half.

6071
04:39:56,150 --> 04:39:58,050
Left side is a Strange.

6072
04:40:00,730 --> 04:40:02,350
I'm going to look to ult in here.

6073
04:40:02,950 --> 04:40:03,630
Groot, look for an ult.

6074
04:40:06,970 --> 04:40:08,730
I got ulted, though.

6075
04:40:08,890 --> 04:40:09,870
I got Jeffed.

6076
04:40:10,170 --> 04:40:11,670
Are you serious?

6077
04:40:11,870 --> 04:40:12,890
Jeff, spit me out.

6078
04:40:13,590 --> 04:40:15,070
What the fuck, Jeff?

6079
04:40:15,070 --> 04:40:15,190
What?

6080
04:40:15,470 --> 04:40:18,530
What are you doing?

6081
04:40:21,230 --> 04:40:22,430
I'm in my ult.

6082
04:40:22,550 --> 04:40:24,710
Jeff ate me and threw me off the map.

6083
04:40:30,610 --> 04:40:31,130
Yo,

6084
04:40:36,770 --> 04:40:36,990
Bucky.

6085
04:40:37,810 --> 04:40:39,250
Okay, we got point.

6086
04:40:39,810 --> 04:40:41,170
I'm so mad.

6087
04:40:41,330 --> 04:40:42,470
Oh, my God.

6088
04:40:42,730 --> 04:40:44,870
I literally had the God play.

6089
04:40:44,870 --> 04:40:46,630
And this guy just murdered me.

6090
04:40:54,530 --> 04:40:57,010
Just fight on point.

6091
04:40:57,430 --> 04:40:58,290
We have point.

6092
04:41:00,210 --> 04:41:04,770
Guys, this is why Jeff is not the pick.

6093
04:41:05,510 --> 04:41:06,910
Never the pick.

6094
04:41:07,870 --> 04:41:09,430
He gave you a heart.

6095
04:41:09,750 --> 04:41:10,510
You are...

6096
04:41:12,410 --> 04:41:13,890
That is the most...

6097
04:41:13,890 --> 04:41:16,590
That is the singular most tilting response he could have given.

6098
04:41:17,110 --> 04:41:17,570
I know.

6099
04:41:19,710 --> 04:41:20,290
I'm dead.

6100
04:41:21,170 --> 04:41:22,090
Oh, no.

6101
04:41:23,170 --> 04:41:23,770
There's a...

6102
04:41:24,340 --> 04:41:26,270
Did they use Luna ult last fight?

6103
04:41:27,390 --> 04:41:28,730
I don't think they did.

6104
04:41:29,370 --> 04:41:30,570
But you can try and bait it out.

6105
04:41:30,730 --> 04:41:31,690
That Bucky is so low.

6106
04:41:32,170 --> 04:41:33,330
Oh, my gosh.

6107
04:41:33,710 --> 04:41:35,550
The worst part is I have to save my ult.

6108
04:41:35,790 --> 04:41:37,450
I can't use my ult to engage.

6109
04:41:38,330 --> 04:41:39,350
Okay, there we go.

6110
04:41:42,490 --> 04:41:42,890
Okay.

6111
04:41:43,470 --> 04:41:45,190
They're gonna use Psylocke ult after this.

6112
04:41:45,690 --> 04:41:46,330
I'm broken now.

6113
04:41:46,890 --> 04:41:48,010
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

6114
04:41:50,590 --> 04:41:51,950
They're gonna Psylocke ult us.

6115
04:41:52,130 --> 04:41:52,650
Luna, Luna, Luna.

6116
04:41:53,790 --> 04:41:54,710
That's huge, that's huge, that's huge.

6117
04:41:55,370 --> 04:41:55,830
Bro, this...

6118
04:41:55,830 --> 04:41:58,570
Oh, my God, Bucky.

6119
04:42:00,350 --> 04:42:00,910
Strange one.

6120
04:42:01,090 --> 04:42:02,670
Strange actual legit one.

6121
04:42:03,070 --> 04:42:04,070
No, not again.

6122
04:42:04,070 --> 04:42:06,410
I might be dead though from this.

6123
04:42:07,730 --> 04:42:09,190
Bucky's half, Bucky's half.

6124
04:42:11,830 --> 04:42:14,430
I don't think Jeff was the pick.

6125
04:42:15,130 --> 04:42:16,470
Why did we play Jeff?

6126
04:42:16,510 --> 04:42:20,410
Not enough, but this guy's about to eat six and go off the map.

6127
04:42:23,170 --> 04:42:24,330
Oh, my God.

6128
04:42:27,950 --> 04:42:29,010
He's getting six.

6129
04:42:30,310 --> 04:42:31,950
What is she doing?

6130
04:42:31,950 --> 04:42:33,110
Go point, go point, go point.

6131
04:42:33,190 --> 04:42:37,070
5% Luna, Luna, Luna.

6132
04:42:37,330 --> 04:42:38,390
Oh, that's a waste.

6133
04:42:38,990 --> 04:42:41,110
Oh, the fuck.

6134
04:42:41,470 --> 04:42:43,950
He actually ate people.

6135
04:42:46,370 --> 04:42:47,950
Behind me, behind me, behind me.

6136
04:42:49,290 --> 04:42:49,730
She's half.

6137
04:42:51,010 --> 04:42:52,110
I'm so low.

6138
04:42:52,590 --> 04:42:52,870
Okay.

6139
04:42:53,830 --> 04:42:55,170
They popped their infinite already.

6140
04:42:55,950 --> 04:42:56,450
Okay.

6141
04:42:57,730 --> 04:42:58,850
Do they have Luna ult?

6142
04:42:58,850 --> 04:43:00,690
No, no, no.

6143
04:43:00,690 --> 04:43:01,650
They don't have Luna.

6144
04:43:07,220 --> 04:43:08,500
I'm getting...

6145
04:43:08,500 --> 04:43:09,740
Spider time can die.

6146
04:43:11,060 --> 04:43:12,120
He's one, he's one.

6147
04:43:13,000 --> 04:43:13,940
Bucky's one.

6148
04:43:14,180 --> 04:43:15,000
Oh, my God.

6149
04:43:15,480 --> 04:43:17,080
I'm dead to Psylocke though.

6150
04:43:18,280 --> 04:43:19,300
Psylocke's one though.

6151
04:43:19,900 --> 04:43:20,800
Our group's doing stuff.

6152
04:43:23,260 --> 04:43:24,320
Oh, no.

6153
04:43:25,220 --> 04:43:25,700
Oh, nice.

6154
04:43:26,020 --> 04:43:26,480
Bucky won.

6155
04:43:31,320 --> 04:43:33,040
I forced Bucky off the map.

6156
04:43:33,180 --> 04:43:34,420
A good amount of time.

6157
04:43:34,800 --> 04:43:35,820
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

6158
04:43:36,300 --> 04:43:36,940
Luna ult.

6159
04:43:39,720 --> 04:43:40,700
I'm fucking damaged.

6160
04:43:43,200 --> 04:43:44,600
I killed the Raccoon.

6161
04:43:44,960 --> 04:43:45,620
I'm 1-0.

6162
04:43:46,040 --> 04:43:48,140
Get in my ult, get in my ult.

6163
04:43:49,040 --> 04:43:50,560
2 seconds, 2 seconds, 2 seconds.

6164
04:43:55,180 --> 04:43:56,140
Psylocke's so low.

6165
04:43:56,480 --> 04:43:57,140
I got you.

6166
04:43:57,140 --> 04:43:59,140
Oh, my God.

6167
04:44:01,900 --> 04:44:02,960
Oh, my God.

6168
04:44:02,980 --> 04:44:03,320
Oh, my God.

6169
04:44:03,320 --> 04:44:04,100
Holy fuck.

6170
04:44:06,160 --> 04:44:09,800
I was gonna fucking fucking punch a shark and we didn't win.

6171
04:44:10,340 --> 04:44:15,000
Dude, I was gonna bam Jeff every game if we didn't win, dude.

6172
04:44:15,960 --> 04:44:20,080
I was gonna watch Jaws and fucking punch a fucking shark.

6173
04:44:20,820 --> 04:44:22,980
I didn't even see if his heart went away.

6174
04:44:24,140 --> 04:44:24,780
Oh, my God.

6175
04:44:24,780 --> 04:44:31,760
Okay, I was gonna say God, I wanted to say something so fucked up, but I shouldn't because I don't want to.

6176
04:44:31,760 --> 04:44:34,720
His highlight play is him kidnapping me.

6177
04:44:34,760 --> 04:44:36,880
His highlight play is him throwing me off the map.

6178
04:44:37,260 --> 04:44:38,920
Don't queue, I want to see.

6179
04:44:39,080 --> 04:44:40,820
I want to see this highlight clip.

6180
04:44:41,300 --> 04:44:44,460
His highlight is him throwing me off the fucking map.

6181
04:44:50,480 --> 04:44:52,360
He fucking jumps off.

6182
04:44:52,360 --> 04:44:54,680
He didn't need to jump off.

6183
04:44:56,400 --> 04:44:58,580
He could have just spat you out.

6184
04:44:58,760 --> 04:45:01,200
No, why did he jump off?

6185
04:45:04,740 --> 04:45:13,800
Bro, the Groot and the shark Jeff, the Groot and the Jeff were like hyping each other up but they were the fucking most tilted players on my team.

6186
04:45:14,940 --> 04:45:17,320
They were hyping each other up.

6187
04:45:17,340 --> 04:45:20,880
That was our Groot from the other game that ran it down.

6188
04:45:20,880 --> 04:45:22,940
Oh my god, let's go.

6189
04:45:25,780 --> 04:45:31,920
I can't believe the Groot and the fucking Jeff were just hyping each other up in the chat.

6190
04:45:32,760 --> 04:45:38,860
Oh my god, that Jeff was so fucking, oh my god I'm gonna fucking freak out when I use the bathroom.

6191
04:45:42,380 --> 04:45:44,080
Alright, banning Hawkeye.

6192
04:46:01,490 --> 04:46:04,790
What's up with these bums banning Black Panther?

6193
04:46:07,670 --> 04:46:11,070
Wait, no way this guy just voted to ban Psylocke.

6194
04:46:11,350 --> 04:46:15,890
I swear to god if Psylocke gets banned, I'm gonna be so fucking tilted.

6195
04:46:16,650 --> 04:46:18,070
80-20 odds.

6196
04:46:18,770 --> 04:46:19,310
Please.

6197
04:46:20,130 --> 04:46:20,850
Please.

6198
04:46:21,670 --> 04:46:22,270
Please.

6199
04:46:24,730 --> 04:46:25,750
Thank god.

6200
04:46:26,350 --> 04:46:27,470
Thank fucking god.

6201
04:46:32,010 --> 04:46:34,550
Oh my god, that stressed me out.

6202
04:46:36,290 --> 04:46:37,970
Wow, we got a Spider-Man?

6203
04:46:38,330 --> 04:46:38,810
Alright.

6204
04:46:38,970 --> 04:46:44,870
Dude, we had four votes for Hela and one vote for Psylocke from our Spider-Man.

6205
04:46:45,430 --> 04:46:46,950
You could've lost it.

6206
04:46:47,270 --> 04:46:50,950
I could've lost the Psylocke to the fucking guy.

6207
04:46:51,370 --> 04:46:54,870
I think our guy is a Iron Man one trick maybe?

6208
04:46:57,470 --> 04:47:01,790
I mean, they banned Iron Man and Black Panther so like, maybe that's somebody's hero pool.

6209
04:47:03,290 --> 04:47:03,710
Yeah.

6210
04:47:04,010 --> 04:47:06,230
What's up with all these Black Panther banners?

6211
04:47:06,990 --> 04:47:09,290
I just realized, guys, I forgot to do the Discord.

6212
04:47:09,470 --> 04:47:09,990
I'm sorry.

6213
04:47:10,310 --> 04:47:11,270
I don't know why.

6214
04:47:11,410 --> 04:47:13,130
This always happens when I fucking play.

6215
04:47:13,310 --> 04:47:20,610
Oh, sorry, I was gonna say, I forgot to do the Fugi thing and I was like, this always happens when I do when I do Marvel Rivals.

6216
04:47:23,710 --> 04:47:25,210
Oh yeah, the Fugi's break?

6217
04:47:25,790 --> 04:47:27,530
No, I just forgot to put it up.

6218
04:47:28,530 --> 04:47:28,950
Oh.

6219
04:47:28,950 --> 04:47:29,630
Oh.

6220
04:47:33,060 --> 04:47:34,620
Okay, guys, we're gonna put it up.

6221
04:47:34,720 --> 04:47:35,780
We're gonna put it up.

6222
04:47:37,460 --> 04:47:37,900
Um.

6223
04:47:39,640 --> 04:47:40,080
After.

6224
04:47:41,220 --> 04:47:41,800
I'm lazy.

6225
04:47:46,760 --> 04:47:47,940
Because I'm in game.

6226
04:47:48,040 --> 04:47:48,560
I'm not lazy.

6227
04:47:48,680 --> 04:47:49,520
I'm just in game.

6228
04:47:51,460 --> 04:47:52,760
Wait, the Fugi's are there?

6229
04:47:53,300 --> 04:47:54,020
No way.

6230
04:47:54,460 --> 04:47:55,300
You guys are lying to me.

6231
04:47:58,820 --> 04:47:59,420
Okay.

6232
04:48:02,870 --> 04:48:04,410
Okay, I'm locking in.

6233
04:48:05,170 --> 04:48:05,770
Oh.

6234
04:48:09,280 --> 04:48:12,180
Oh, they're like pre-pushing this.

6235
04:48:13,840 --> 04:48:14,960
Nice, Ruben.

6236
04:48:16,700 --> 04:48:18,020
We should push up.

6237
04:48:18,080 --> 04:48:18,900
We should push up with this.

6238
04:48:19,340 --> 04:48:20,240
This Magneto dies.

6239
04:48:21,260 --> 04:48:22,620
On the penny, yes.

6240
04:48:23,100 --> 04:48:24,300
I put the orb on you.

6241
04:48:24,940 --> 04:48:27,560
Okay, you are so low.

6242
04:48:29,200 --> 04:48:30,320
Ow, they really hurt.

6243
04:48:30,320 --> 04:48:30,700
Penny's half.

6244
04:48:30,920 --> 04:48:31,200
Penny's half.

6245
04:48:32,460 --> 04:48:32,980
Penny's one.

6246
04:48:33,060 --> 04:48:33,500
Penny's one.

6247
04:48:35,440 --> 04:48:35,800
Nevermind.

6248
04:48:39,530 --> 04:48:40,450
Where the fuck did you go?

6249
04:48:40,470 --> 04:48:41,030
Oh, you disappeared.

6250
04:48:42,290 --> 04:48:43,950
I'm putting it on the Spider-Man now.

6251
04:48:44,290 --> 04:48:45,170
Oh, you are so low.

6252
04:48:45,230 --> 04:48:46,330
I should have left it on you.

6253
04:48:46,630 --> 04:48:47,090
Nah, I'm good.

6254
04:48:48,290 --> 04:48:52,110
I'm putting it back on you, the orb.

6255
04:48:52,730 --> 04:48:53,450
Thank you.

6256
04:48:53,450 --> 04:48:53,630
Oh.

6257
04:48:56,150 --> 04:48:57,730
I'm not close at all.

6258
04:48:58,150 --> 04:48:58,750
She's dead.

6259
04:48:59,010 --> 04:48:59,710
Nah, we're good.

6260
04:49:00,890 --> 04:49:02,610
Uh, Magneto won.

6261
04:49:02,830 --> 04:49:03,470
Magneto's low.

6262
04:49:03,910 --> 04:49:04,730
Magneto's so low.

6263
04:49:05,810 --> 04:49:07,950
Wait, wait, there's a magic behind.

6264
04:49:08,050 --> 04:49:08,610
There's a magic behind.

6265
04:49:09,710 --> 04:49:10,890
There's a magic behind me.

6266
04:49:12,730 --> 04:49:13,570
It's not you.

6267
04:49:17,610 --> 04:49:18,790
I don't need healing.

6268
04:49:19,030 --> 04:49:20,950
I can't move my mouse and ping.

6269
04:49:20,950 --> 04:49:24,810
I hear the magic and the Psylocke walking around.

6270
04:49:24,930 --> 04:49:26,170
I'm fucking so scared.

6271
04:49:26,950 --> 04:49:28,490
They're gonna kill me.

6272
04:49:29,050 --> 04:49:29,470
No, no, no.

6273
04:49:29,630 --> 04:49:31,710
I'm watching you from the rooftops.

6274
04:49:31,750 --> 04:49:32,210
Don't worry.

6275
04:49:32,730 --> 04:49:33,210
Okay.

6276
04:49:38,690 --> 04:49:40,130
Oh my god, I'm missing every shot.

6277
04:49:40,270 --> 04:49:40,630
I'm sorry.

6278
04:49:41,990 --> 04:49:43,630
I'm not locked in right now.

6279
04:49:43,870 --> 04:49:44,690
I'm locked in now.

6280
04:49:46,470 --> 04:49:47,130
That's huge.

6281
04:49:47,310 --> 04:49:48,190
I'm gonna ult after this.

6282
04:49:48,710 --> 04:49:49,530
I ulted.

6283
04:49:49,850 --> 04:49:50,930
Big, big, big, big, big.

6284
04:49:54,130 --> 04:49:58,610
Oh my god, are you trying to tell me Mantis is not bad and we are not willingly playing Mantis?

6285
04:50:01,670 --> 04:50:05,730
There is a magic behind me and I'm gonna be dead.

6286
04:50:10,390 --> 04:50:11,710
I'll avenge you.

6287
04:50:13,750 --> 04:50:14,790
We have no heals.

6288
04:50:14,790 --> 04:50:15,550
We have no heals.

6289
04:50:17,430 --> 04:50:18,850
Our cloak died first.

6290
04:50:28,770 --> 04:50:30,070
Everything will be fine.

6291
04:50:32,450 --> 04:50:33,590
I can put orb on you, Mac.

6292
04:50:33,690 --> 04:50:34,730
Oh, they have a Moon Knight now.

6293
04:50:36,590 --> 04:50:37,430
Destroy the orb.

6294
04:50:38,590 --> 04:50:39,470
Oh, Spiderman.

6295
04:50:40,630 --> 04:50:41,390
Poor guy.

6296
04:50:43,710 --> 04:50:44,810
I instantly killed her.

6297
04:50:46,310 --> 04:50:49,470
There's a dozen left and they've got Psylocke.

6298
04:50:49,470 --> 04:50:50,410
Moon Knight won.

6299
04:50:50,930 --> 04:50:53,090
You only have cloak heals.

6300
04:50:53,370 --> 04:51:00,150
I just saw the craziest rollout from Spiderman.

6301
04:51:02,190 --> 04:51:05,670
Even if he's not doing anything, he knows how to do rollouts.

6302
04:51:08,370 --> 04:51:09,970
He went and practiced those in customs.

6303
04:51:11,230 --> 04:51:13,050
That was insane.

6304
04:51:13,870 --> 04:51:17,030
He might not be doing shit, but I was impressed with that rollout.

6305
04:51:20,010 --> 04:51:21,810
You're fine because I'm healing.

6306
04:51:22,130 --> 04:51:22,990
People are taking damage.

6307
04:51:24,570 --> 04:51:25,690
Okay, nice.

6308
04:51:29,450 --> 04:51:32,490
He might be useless, but that was pretty cool.

6309
04:51:35,690 --> 04:51:38,390
Not gonna lie, that was pretty fucking cool.

6310
04:51:43,170 --> 04:51:44,830
I'm gonna jump on the Moon Knight.

6311
04:51:49,830 --> 04:51:52,030
The Hulk is half.

6312
04:51:55,670 --> 04:51:56,990
Psylocke won HP beyond.

6313
04:51:57,530 --> 04:51:59,310
This is where I died though.

6314
04:52:01,030 --> 04:52:05,110
Psylocke got me in the support area.

6315
04:52:05,510 --> 04:52:06,450
No supports.

6316
04:52:11,570 --> 04:52:13,710
I just got my ult too.

6317
04:52:13,790 --> 04:52:14,390
That sucks.

6318
04:52:14,930 --> 04:52:18,030
I mean, I could ult into Saul if you guys can make it.

6319
04:52:18,170 --> 04:52:19,430
Touch the Saul, Spidey.

6320
04:52:19,550 --> 04:52:20,630
Oh, shit.

6321
04:52:21,930 --> 04:52:22,990
Oh, shit.

6322
04:52:25,910 --> 04:52:28,550
He's like, alright, I guess this is where I die.

6323
04:52:29,690 --> 04:52:31,330
He's like, oh, shit.

6324
04:52:31,890 --> 04:52:34,490
Oh, shit, I was blowing their backline.

6325
04:52:39,770 --> 04:52:41,190
I killed their Mantis.

6326
04:52:45,710 --> 04:52:48,610
He's just like, dude, I have to touch, dude.

6327
04:52:48,970 --> 04:52:51,390
Oh, shit, I don't want to play.

6328
04:52:52,690 --> 04:52:54,210
Well, that's a strange ult.

6329
04:52:56,330 --> 04:52:57,150
That's fine.

6330
04:52:58,970 --> 04:53:02,690
Oh, shit.

6331
04:53:05,710 --> 04:53:08,110
Bro, jumped on play and instantly died.

6332
04:53:09,630 --> 04:53:13,130
He's just like, God, I have to do it, bro.

6333
04:53:13,130 --> 04:53:14,050
Oh, fuck.

6334
04:53:14,570 --> 04:53:18,370
I was busy in their backline doing shit, man.

6335
04:53:18,510 --> 04:53:21,750
He's doing Overwatch rollouts, that's the only thing he was doing.

6336
04:53:22,350 --> 04:53:23,970
The fuck was he doing?

6337
04:53:24,490 --> 04:53:28,470
I don't know what their Spidey's doing either, but I'm glad he's not Spidey.

6338
04:53:29,150 --> 04:53:30,450
They have a Spider-Man.

6339
04:53:31,230 --> 04:53:32,410
They had one.

6340
04:53:33,970 --> 04:53:35,770
Yeah, their Spider-Man is just legit.

6341
04:53:36,110 --> 04:53:37,430
That's their Jett player.

6342
04:53:37,610 --> 04:53:39,390
Wait, wait.

6343
04:53:39,390 --> 04:53:40,870
Strange one, strange one, strange one.

6344
04:53:41,790 --> 04:53:43,110
Okay, nevermind, he's getting healed.

6345
04:53:44,630 --> 04:53:45,450
Oh, fuck.

6346
04:53:46,610 --> 04:53:46,970
I'm okay.

6347
04:53:47,710 --> 04:53:48,290
I'm doing stuff.

6348
04:53:48,790 --> 04:53:50,550
Yo, what is that Spider-Man doing?

6349
04:53:55,490 --> 04:53:56,950
I'm trying to get to you.

6350
04:53:57,530 --> 04:53:58,670
There's a Spider-Man heading in.

6351
04:53:59,410 --> 04:54:00,590
They have Mantis ult, right?

6352
04:54:00,790 --> 04:54:02,030
I'm so fucking low.

6353
04:54:03,270 --> 04:54:05,030
You have to bait them.

6354
04:54:06,210 --> 04:54:08,250
Get the bait the ult out though, anyway.

6355
04:54:08,570 --> 04:54:09,490
Okay, perfect.

6356
04:54:16,990 --> 04:54:18,030
I'm ulting this.

6357
04:54:19,290 --> 04:54:20,190
I'm taking a nap.

6358
04:54:20,950 --> 04:54:22,310
Give me a sec, I'm feeling a little sleepy.

6359
04:54:24,950 --> 04:54:26,070
I'm ulting this.

6360
04:54:31,890 --> 04:54:33,490
Oh my god, I exposed him though.

6361
04:54:33,510 --> 04:54:33,990
I froze him.

6362
04:54:35,070 --> 04:54:36,270
Whoa, what the?

6363
04:54:36,410 --> 04:54:38,390
Yo, this guy loves me.

6364
04:54:40,070 --> 04:54:42,470
I hear the Spider-Man, but I just can't see him.

6365
04:54:44,490 --> 04:54:46,250
That was such a good freeze too.

6366
04:54:46,390 --> 04:54:47,110
God damn it.

6367
04:54:48,510 --> 04:54:49,990
The Spider-Man's above us.

6368
04:54:51,650 --> 04:54:52,610
I'm trying to live.

6369
04:54:53,250 --> 04:54:54,310
It's just range.

6370
04:54:55,070 --> 04:54:56,730
What is this guy doing?

6371
04:54:57,790 --> 04:54:58,270
Feeding.

6372
04:55:00,190 --> 04:55:01,750
Yeah, but he has...

6373
04:55:01,750 --> 04:55:02,810
He's so low.

6374
04:55:03,530 --> 04:55:05,670
I got you.

6375
04:55:08,590 --> 04:55:10,310
Oh my god.

6376
04:55:10,690 --> 04:55:12,770
Their range is low again.

6377
04:55:12,970 --> 04:55:14,510
And so is their hulk.

6378
04:55:17,430 --> 04:55:19,390
Oh my god.

6379
04:55:19,910 --> 04:55:21,410
I think we might need a second pink.

6380
04:55:27,350 --> 04:55:28,950
I can't do anything.

6381
04:55:29,170 --> 04:55:29,750
I'm sleeping.

6382
04:55:31,070 --> 04:55:31,710
No!

6383
04:55:31,710 --> 04:55:33,530
Oh my god.

6384
04:55:33,670 --> 04:55:33,990
Wait, wait.

6385
04:55:34,250 --> 04:55:34,710
No,

6386
04:55:37,750 --> 04:55:38,570
I lied.

6387
04:55:39,190 --> 04:55:40,990
Why did I TP on the cart?

6388
04:55:43,170 --> 04:55:45,130
Bro, why are you on cloak and dagger?

6389
04:55:46,050 --> 04:55:47,570
Mantis is not even bad.

6390
04:55:47,690 --> 04:55:49,930
You're willingly playing cloak and dagger.

6391
04:55:53,810 --> 04:55:56,650
I don't know.

6392
04:55:56,870 --> 04:55:58,190
That sounded like a dude from Chowder.

6393
04:55:58,190 --> 04:55:59,910
What happened?

6394
04:56:03,890 --> 04:56:05,830
Oh my god.

6395
04:56:06,930 --> 04:56:08,410
I'm waiting right now.

6396
04:56:08,650 --> 04:56:09,870
Are you guys destabilized?

6397
04:56:10,350 --> 04:56:11,610
We're staggering in.

6398
04:56:13,150 --> 04:56:14,890
I would never stagger.

6399
04:56:15,230 --> 04:56:16,690
Reuben, you're gonna stagger right here.

6400
04:56:16,790 --> 04:56:17,830
No, no, no, no, no.

6401
04:56:18,450 --> 04:56:19,910
I'm not staggering.

6402
04:56:20,090 --> 04:56:21,470
I'm not doing it.

6403
04:56:21,970 --> 04:56:24,210
Are you serious?

6404
04:56:24,330 --> 04:56:25,990
Spider-Man clipped me off.

6405
04:56:27,070 --> 04:56:28,270
I'm going to touch cart.

6406
04:56:28,270 --> 04:56:29,790
Okay, I can...

6407
04:56:29,790 --> 04:56:31,310
There's a Spider-Man that's just...

6408
04:56:31,310 --> 04:56:32,230
Don't look at the hole.

6409
04:56:32,390 --> 04:56:34,290
He's just ripping people off the hole.

6410
04:56:36,590 --> 04:56:38,950
Bro, why can't our Spider-Man do that?

6411
04:56:39,870 --> 04:56:42,070
Okay, look at where our cloak is real quick.

6412
04:56:44,250 --> 04:56:45,230
I got you.

6413
04:56:46,410 --> 04:56:47,730
Dude, their Spider-Man's low.

6414
04:56:47,890 --> 04:56:48,410
So low.

6415
04:56:48,590 --> 04:56:49,350
I can't do anything.

6416
04:56:49,530 --> 04:56:50,390
I'm getting...

6417
04:56:51,910 --> 04:56:52,550
He's one.

6418
04:56:52,550 --> 04:56:53,010
He's one.

6419
04:56:53,150 --> 04:56:55,050
I need to back up into the spawn though.

6420
04:56:55,550 --> 04:56:58,030
That's a huge kill on Hulk.

6421
04:56:58,170 --> 04:56:58,410
Yeah.

6422
04:56:58,990 --> 04:57:00,510
This is last fight.

6423
04:57:00,850 --> 04:57:02,660
Yeah, they weren't pushing cart, so like...

6424
04:57:04,390 --> 04:57:06,710
There's a Psylocke behind us.

6425
04:57:12,670 --> 04:57:13,410
Don't work.

6426
04:57:13,490 --> 04:57:15,150
He's trying to grip people out into the hole.

6427
04:57:15,390 --> 04:57:16,710
Okay, I...

6428
04:57:16,710 --> 04:57:17,210
What?

6429
04:57:20,310 --> 04:57:21,070
I'm so bad.

6430
04:57:21,850 --> 04:57:22,910
Oh my god.

6431
04:57:24,090 --> 04:57:24,550
Psylocke's one.

6432
04:57:25,670 --> 04:57:28,250
We have to focus on Hulk and...

6433
04:57:28,650 --> 04:57:30,410
I'm trying to get back to point, but I'm one health.

6434
04:57:31,510 --> 04:57:32,830
Yeah, I can't...

6435
04:57:32,830 --> 04:57:33,930
I got you, I got you, I got you.

6436
04:57:34,630 --> 04:57:36,530
We have to kill them because...

6437
04:57:36,530 --> 04:57:37,850
Staggers are coming in.

6438
04:57:40,430 --> 04:57:41,710
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, Hulk, please.

6439
04:57:41,890 --> 04:57:42,450
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

6440
04:57:42,450 --> 04:57:44,110
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk.

6441
04:57:47,150 --> 04:57:47,670
Okay.

6442
04:57:48,370 --> 04:57:49,730
Their Maxis is one.

6443
04:57:50,570 --> 04:57:52,290
Bro, I'm gonna squish a spider today.

6444
04:57:52,590 --> 04:57:52,930
Where is he?

6445
04:57:54,410 --> 04:57:55,970
I'm gonna squish the spider.

6446
04:57:56,630 --> 04:57:59,450
Dude, I was trying to fucking zone him out the whole time.

6447
04:57:59,610 --> 04:58:00,770
And he's just on the ceiling.

6448
04:58:00,810 --> 04:58:02,490
Like, what am I gonna do against that?

6449
04:58:02,930 --> 04:58:06,030
I just gripped like four people into the...

6450
04:58:06,030 --> 04:58:08,010
Four people into the pit.

6451
04:58:10,070 --> 04:58:12,610
Look at their Spider-Man stat line.

6452
04:58:13,390 --> 04:58:16,270
Why can't our Spider-Man do that?

6453
04:58:16,430 --> 04:58:16,870
Like, I...

6454
04:58:17,570 --> 04:58:19,070
I don't understand.

6455
04:58:20,010 --> 04:58:21,430
I don't understand.

6456
04:58:21,650 --> 04:58:23,170
Why can't our Spider-Man do that?

6457
04:58:23,230 --> 04:58:25,050
He just has cool roll outs, that's it.

6458
04:58:25,530 --> 04:58:26,790
Just looks cool.

6459
04:58:26,950 --> 04:58:28,150
He can't do anything else.

6460
04:58:31,370 --> 04:58:33,290
Guys, our Spider-Man...

6461
04:58:33,290 --> 04:58:35,630
Fucking sucked compared to the other Spider-Man.

6462
04:58:36,230 --> 04:58:38,370
Spooner-Man versus Spider-Man.

6463
04:58:38,750 --> 04:58:40,470
Bro, it's...

6464
04:58:40,470 --> 04:58:42,530
It's so fucking sad.

6465
04:58:43,170 --> 04:58:44,690
It's so sad.

6466
04:58:48,130 --> 04:58:50,230
Oh my god, 11-10.

6467
04:58:53,930 --> 04:58:55,530
I don't understand.

6468
04:58:55,950 --> 04:58:57,470
I think it's because we have Punisher, too.

6469
04:58:58,070 --> 04:58:58,610
We have Punisher.

6470
04:58:59,430 --> 04:59:03,710
I like how the enemy Spider-Man looked so cool doing the shit he did, but he had 11 deaths.

6471
04:59:03,850 --> 04:59:05,710
I thought he had more kills, honestly.

6472
04:59:06,430 --> 04:59:08,390
He was fucking so annoying.

6473
04:59:12,530 --> 04:59:14,890
This guy is saying, I've been Punisher this entire game.

6474
04:59:16,990 --> 04:59:21,350
Bro, the other enemy Spider-Man looked so fucking cool.

6475
04:59:22,470 --> 04:59:23,730
Now we're just gaslighting him.

6476
04:59:24,230 --> 04:59:28,050
He's just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

6477
04:59:32,190 --> 04:59:35,510
Oh, they have Squirrel.

6478
04:59:35,650 --> 04:59:37,690
There's, like, Psylocke to the left side.

6479
04:59:43,840 --> 04:59:45,540
They have a Squirrel girl.

6480
04:59:45,560 --> 04:59:46,280
Yeah, they do.

6481
04:59:48,160 --> 04:59:52,120
Why doesn't he want to play play Mantis?

6482
04:59:52,700 --> 04:59:53,940
Mantis is so good.

6483
04:59:54,320 --> 04:59:55,460
Oh, I'm a piece of shit.

6484
04:59:55,560 --> 04:59:56,780
Oh my fucking god.

6485
04:59:57,640 --> 04:59:59,160
Wait, didn't you have the...

6486
04:59:59,160 --> 05:00:00,240
Oh, you had the orb.

6487
05:00:00,680 --> 05:00:02,920
Wow, you got fucking gapped.

6488
05:00:05,020 --> 05:00:06,180
Oh, Strange is low.

6489
05:00:06,180 --> 05:00:06,740
Oh, Strange is low.

6490
05:00:11,460 --> 05:00:12,140
Squirrel girl low.

6491
05:00:12,260 --> 05:00:12,920
Squirrel girl low.

6492
05:00:13,920 --> 05:00:15,860
I have an orb on you, Ruben.

6493
05:00:16,360 --> 05:00:17,040
Thank you.

6494
05:00:18,520 --> 05:00:19,080
Focus Hulk.

6495
05:00:21,660 --> 05:00:22,480
Hulk is half.

6496
05:00:22,560 --> 05:00:22,960
Hulk is half.

6497
05:00:23,040 --> 05:00:23,860
He was looking for the medkit.

6498
05:00:24,300 --> 05:00:24,680
Hulk is one.

6499
05:00:25,420 --> 05:00:26,360
He's actually one.

6500
05:00:26,820 --> 05:00:28,280
Oh my god, he was so low.

6501
05:00:28,640 --> 05:00:29,300
I have to reload, though.

6502
05:00:29,320 --> 05:00:29,720
I can't heal.

6503
05:00:32,500 --> 05:00:33,220
You're fine.

6504
05:00:34,020 --> 05:00:34,380
Wait.

6505
05:00:36,400 --> 05:00:37,780
I swear, I'm going to start banning Hulk, too.

6506
05:00:37,860 --> 05:00:39,400
I'm going to ban Hulk at this point.

6507
05:00:39,860 --> 05:00:41,440
Like, I can't deal with Hulk.

6508
05:00:41,660 --> 05:00:45,780
I don't know why I thought my tank was with me up there.

6509
05:00:46,840 --> 05:00:47,920
You mean you are one tank?

6510
05:00:48,740 --> 05:00:50,460
Yeah, I thought he was up there with me.

6511
05:00:50,620 --> 05:00:51,180
I don't know why.

6512
05:00:51,320 --> 05:00:53,780
To be fair, it's literally our one tank.

6513
05:00:54,480 --> 05:00:55,320
Damn, really?

6514
05:00:59,830 --> 05:01:00,190
Really?

6515
05:01:00,610 --> 05:01:02,630
We had two DPS and no kills?

6516
05:01:02,630 --> 05:01:05,510
Yeah, no, I did it to stay alive.

6517
05:01:05,690 --> 05:01:06,550
I was going to die otherwise.

6518
05:01:06,990 --> 05:01:08,250
There's a Moon Knight right up here.

6519
05:01:08,330 --> 05:01:10,970
Moon Knight is...

6520
05:01:10,970 --> 05:01:11,310
He's one.

6521
05:01:11,390 --> 05:01:11,870
Moon Knight's one.

6522
05:01:11,970 --> 05:01:12,190
They're one.

6523
05:01:19,290 --> 05:01:21,530
Can we use...

6524
05:01:21,530 --> 05:01:23,190
Oh, Manta's low.

6525
05:01:27,290 --> 05:01:29,630
Oh my god, I don't know what to do.

6526
05:01:32,650 --> 05:01:34,370
Their tank is just...

6527
05:01:34,370 --> 05:01:36,570
Very aggressive on us.

6528
05:01:37,550 --> 05:01:39,130
We'll get point with my Night's Salt.

6529
05:01:41,430 --> 05:01:42,950
Their tank's really good.

6530
05:01:46,580 --> 05:01:47,460
I am kin.

6531
05:01:49,320 --> 05:01:51,540
I have to save my ult for...

6532
05:01:51,540 --> 05:01:52,780
I have ult.

6533
05:01:55,600 --> 05:01:57,680
Oh, he's going to go DPS if we don't...

6534
05:01:57,680 --> 05:01:58,120
He's turning.

6535
05:02:03,360 --> 05:02:04,480
Oh, I'm so low.

6536
05:02:07,820 --> 05:02:08,820
Oh, I'm easy.

6537
05:02:10,960 --> 05:02:12,540
Good job surviving that.

6538
05:02:13,040 --> 05:02:15,000
I don't know where the Psylocke is.

6539
05:02:15,520 --> 05:02:16,320
She's top left.

6540
05:02:16,700 --> 05:02:18,040
We can mini-hulk, mini-hulk.

6541
05:02:19,140 --> 05:02:19,860
Their Moon Knight's low.

6542
05:02:20,780 --> 05:02:22,000
He has Moon Knight all.

6543
05:02:22,060 --> 05:02:22,600
I'm going for him.

6544
05:02:23,840 --> 05:02:25,180
I have Moon Knight all here.

6545
05:02:27,880 --> 05:02:29,080
I put it on you, Ruben.

6546
05:02:30,840 --> 05:02:31,900
That hits me?

6547
05:02:31,920 --> 05:02:32,320
Keep me up.

6548
05:02:35,840 --> 05:02:36,440
Oh, I need help.

6549
05:02:44,630 --> 05:02:45,490
I can't.

6550
05:02:45,610 --> 05:02:46,930
I'm coming back with Psylocke ult.

6551
05:02:48,170 --> 05:02:49,070
I'm trying to heal.

6552
05:02:49,370 --> 05:02:51,570
Okay, I got it.

6553
05:02:51,730 --> 05:02:52,430
This is the last fight.

6554
05:02:53,790 --> 05:02:55,170
Psylocke top left, half HP.

6555
05:02:58,490 --> 05:02:59,370
I can't...

6556
05:03:03,470 --> 05:03:04,350
Mini-hulk,

6557
05:03:07,930 --> 05:03:09,390
mini -hulk.

6558
05:03:10,230 --> 05:03:11,350
I don't know if...

6559
05:03:11,350 --> 05:03:12,950
I don't know if magic is it here.

6560
05:03:13,430 --> 05:03:14,550
Yeah, I'm switching to Psylocke.

6561
05:03:15,470 --> 05:03:15,910
Okay.

6562
05:03:16,770 --> 05:03:19,490
We gotta kill these guys before they push us, so they don't push us.

6563
05:03:20,810 --> 05:03:21,530
Nice, we got it.

6564
05:03:21,530 --> 05:03:21,950
Thank you.

6565
05:03:22,810 --> 05:03:23,150
Alright.

6566
05:03:28,750 --> 05:03:29,870
I'm gonna pull up.

6567
05:03:31,910 --> 05:03:33,310
Ruben, you have...

6568
05:03:33,310 --> 05:03:34,630
You have the orb.

6569
05:03:35,410 --> 05:03:36,270
Thank you.

6570
05:03:39,770 --> 05:03:41,450
Oh, I thought he was going good.

6571
05:03:47,380 --> 05:03:47,960
Nice.

6572
05:03:49,540 --> 05:03:51,180
You almost fell, I saw that.

6573
05:03:52,280 --> 05:03:55,100
I almost fell off the map.

6574
05:03:55,800 --> 05:03:57,120
I saw that.

6575
05:03:57,460 --> 05:03:59,160
Jesus, I got so scared.

6576
05:04:01,220 --> 05:04:03,140
I am careful.

6577
05:04:03,540 --> 05:04:05,980
Dude, their hulk is just matching me everywhere I go.

6578
05:04:06,780 --> 05:04:07,640
That's so annoying.

6579
05:04:08,980 --> 05:04:10,500
Maybe it's time to play hulk.

6580
05:04:11,140 --> 05:04:14,500
The hulk is low.

6581
05:04:14,580 --> 05:04:16,140
The main tank is dead.

6582
05:04:21,140 --> 05:04:21,940
Alright.

6583
05:04:22,620 --> 05:04:23,660
We're dancing.

6584
05:04:25,100 --> 05:04:27,440
We're dancing.

6585
05:04:29,140 --> 05:04:31,360
We're dancing.

6586
05:04:31,360 --> 05:04:31,900
I'm popping ult.

6587
05:04:37,240 --> 05:04:41,780
Alright, they have...

6588
05:04:41,780 --> 05:04:42,640
Psylocke on her.

6589
05:04:42,900 --> 05:04:45,100
Oh my god, strange is so low.

6590
05:04:49,580 --> 05:04:51,580
I'm going for a Psylocke ult.

6591
05:04:52,120 --> 05:04:52,400
Okay.

6592
05:04:53,620 --> 05:04:54,180
Psylocke dead.

6593
05:04:59,960 --> 05:05:01,400
Got you.

6594
05:05:01,400 --> 05:05:02,420
Get the strange.

6595
05:05:02,500 --> 05:05:04,080
She has ult.

6596
05:05:05,080 --> 05:05:06,500
I know, but he has ult.

6597
05:05:06,560 --> 05:05:09,200
He is actually looking for ult.

6598
05:05:12,120 --> 05:05:13,940
Oh my god.

6599
05:05:14,440 --> 05:05:16,820
Why is this so fucking hard?

6600
05:05:18,140 --> 05:05:19,080
Okay, we're fine.

6601
05:05:19,720 --> 05:05:20,460
No, I'm stuck.

6602
05:05:20,960 --> 05:05:23,260
We're fine.

6603
05:05:24,060 --> 05:05:24,980
Oh my god.

6604
05:05:25,280 --> 05:05:26,820
Why are these games like this?

6605
05:05:27,360 --> 05:05:28,240
Grab my ankles.

6606
05:05:28,240 --> 05:05:29,560
Oh my god.

6607
05:05:29,680 --> 05:05:32,960
Thank you for the 50 gifted subs.

6608
05:05:34,200 --> 05:05:34,940
Thank you.

6609
05:05:35,260 --> 05:05:36,240
Oh my god.

6610
05:05:37,860 --> 05:05:39,100
Thank you so much.

6611
05:05:44,480 --> 05:05:46,380
I think he's just saving...

6612
05:05:46,380 --> 05:05:48,400
He's saving ult for the last fight.

6613
05:05:51,600 --> 05:05:52,760
I think that's what he's doing.

6614
05:05:53,100 --> 05:05:54,160
He still has it.

6615
05:05:59,260 --> 05:06:00,720
I'm scared of the eye.

6616
05:06:00,880 --> 05:06:02,240
We can push up.

6617
05:06:02,780 --> 05:06:04,560
We have two picks.

6618
05:06:07,520 --> 05:06:08,140
I have ult too.

6619
05:06:09,740 --> 05:06:12,040
I just killed that guy while he was typing.

6620
05:06:12,460 --> 05:06:12,940
Nice.

6621
05:06:13,420 --> 05:06:14,840
I'm damage boosting this.

6622
05:06:15,760 --> 05:06:17,340
I'm damage boosting this.

6623
05:06:19,520 --> 05:06:21,020
I got one anyway.

6624
05:06:24,380 --> 05:06:25,740
Oh no.

6625
05:06:26,760 --> 05:06:27,480
That was...

6626
05:06:27,480 --> 05:06:28,560
No ult.

6627
05:06:29,140 --> 05:06:31,020
We used two ults there.

6628
05:06:31,680 --> 05:06:33,280
And the more ult was so good.

6629
05:06:34,460 --> 05:06:35,140
Damn.

6630
05:06:35,340 --> 05:06:36,980
I got fished.

6631
05:06:37,480 --> 05:06:38,020
Yeah.

6632
05:06:38,240 --> 05:06:39,460
We have one fight left.

6633
05:06:39,960 --> 05:06:41,880
We have Raccoon ult for it.

6634
05:06:43,760 --> 05:06:45,360
I can't heal you there.

6635
05:06:48,020 --> 05:06:48,560
Oh...

6636
05:06:48,560 --> 05:06:50,360
I'm gonna give you the thing.

6637
05:06:50,640 --> 05:06:51,920
And then we'll see how it goes.

6638
05:06:54,560 --> 05:06:56,380
Yeah, but they live forever.

6639
05:06:57,020 --> 05:06:57,440
That's the thing.

6640
05:07:01,640 --> 05:07:02,860
There's a Psylocke behind.

6641
05:07:03,140 --> 05:07:04,120
Oh my god.

6642
05:07:07,820 --> 05:07:08,740
Be safe.

6643
05:07:09,020 --> 05:07:09,240
Okay.

6644
05:07:10,380 --> 05:07:12,160
They didn't do anything with that.

6645
05:07:16,010 --> 05:07:17,470
I'm trying to keep our...

6646
05:07:17,470 --> 05:07:17,970
I killed Alana.

6647
05:07:18,470 --> 05:07:19,630
Strange, strange, strange.

6648
05:07:19,750 --> 05:07:21,750
I couldn't do it.

6649
05:07:25,070 --> 05:07:26,670
Oh no, we can't leave.

6650
05:07:27,550 --> 05:07:28,310
I'm dead.

6651
05:07:29,570 --> 05:07:30,610
Nah, this is winnable.

6652
05:07:34,110 --> 05:07:35,090
No, no, no.

6653
05:07:37,510 --> 05:07:38,970
Couldn't do anything.

6654
05:07:38,970 --> 05:07:39,190
Dang.

6655
05:07:40,590 --> 05:07:41,570
Oh man.

6656
05:07:43,790 --> 05:07:44,510
Damn.

6657
05:07:44,990 --> 05:07:46,390
Oh, that was so close.

6658
05:07:49,070 --> 05:07:53,210
No, the Jett player won!

6659
05:07:54,790 --> 05:07:56,610
How did we let him win?

6660
05:07:57,530 --> 05:07:58,250
Oh my god.

6661
05:07:59,570 --> 05:08:01,450
I think maybe a second tank would've...

6662
05:08:01,450 --> 05:08:02,970
I don't have a second tank without...

6663
05:08:03,510 --> 05:08:04,230
Oh no.

6664
05:08:06,250 --> 05:08:07,090
Oh man.

6665
05:08:07,090 --> 05:08:10,090
Oh my god, and you diffed that Psylocke too.

6666
05:08:10,190 --> 05:08:11,350
Yeah, dude.

6667
05:08:11,950 --> 05:08:12,550
Fuck.

6668
05:08:15,210 --> 05:08:17,390
I did all that for nothing.

6669
05:08:17,470 --> 05:08:19,210
Oh my god, the BM.

6670
05:08:19,510 --> 05:08:21,110
He says, don't fail.

6671
05:08:23,470 --> 05:08:25,130
Mac, are you okay, Mac?

6672
05:08:25,690 --> 05:08:26,630
I'm fine.

6673
05:08:26,750 --> 05:08:27,470
Are you okay?

6674
05:08:28,950 --> 05:08:30,490
I'm not fine at all.

6675
05:08:31,310 --> 05:08:32,810
I'm really kidding.

6676
05:08:33,310 --> 05:08:35,870
To go a second fucking tank on my team.

6677
05:08:35,870 --> 05:08:39,150
I never want to see this guy play DPS on my team ever again.

6678
05:08:39,230 --> 05:08:40,850
Wow, really, kid?

6679
05:08:41,190 --> 05:08:44,250
Yeah, that guy should've filled.

6680
05:08:49,920 --> 05:08:52,280
That is so fucked up.

6681
05:08:52,480 --> 05:08:53,700
I can't believe it.

6682
05:08:55,640 --> 05:08:57,240
Our queues are so fucked up.

6683
05:08:57,600 --> 05:08:58,100
Our queues.

6684
05:08:59,420 --> 05:09:04,120
Can we get five gifted subs to make up for the mental turmoil of that game?

6685
05:09:08,980 --> 05:09:10,980
I love Marvel Rivals.

6686
05:09:11,600 --> 05:09:13,080
It's my favorite.

6687
05:09:13,860 --> 05:09:14,820
I love it.

6688
05:09:16,920 --> 05:09:19,820
I wonder what it's like to be GM2 again.

6689
05:09:24,600 --> 05:09:26,040
It's okay.

6690
05:09:26,940 --> 05:09:28,400
We can climb back up.

6691
05:09:29,220 --> 05:09:30,780
We can climb back.

6692
05:09:30,920 --> 05:09:31,680
Believe in us.

6693
05:09:32,420 --> 05:09:33,500
We'll be fine.

6694
05:09:33,920 --> 05:09:35,360
We're so healthy.

6695
05:09:37,480 --> 05:09:38,360
Oh my god.

6696
05:09:38,440 --> 05:09:40,420
Thank you so much for the five gifted subs.

6697
05:09:40,740 --> 05:09:41,480
Thank you.

6698
05:09:42,160 --> 05:09:44,200
I really appreciate it.

6699
05:09:44,880 --> 05:09:45,740
Oh my god.

6700
05:09:45,780 --> 05:09:47,000
We got Golden Kappa.

6701
05:09:47,700 --> 05:09:48,820
Holy fuck.

6702
05:09:49,800 --> 05:09:50,920
Holy moly.

6703
05:09:51,660 --> 05:09:52,620
Oh my god.

6704
05:09:52,780 --> 05:09:54,620
We got the Golden Kappa hype train.

6705
05:09:55,200 --> 05:09:58,240
Guys, if you don't give five subs, you're not going to get the Golden Kappa.

6706
05:10:01,360 --> 05:10:02,960
I love them.

6707
05:10:02,960 --> 05:10:03,000
I love them.

6708
05:10:06,140 --> 05:10:08,100
We're going to ignore Valorant.

6709
05:10:08,200 --> 05:10:09,500
We'll always ignore Valorant.

6710
05:10:11,080 --> 05:10:12,840
Let's farm Valorant's money.

6711
05:10:15,060 --> 05:10:16,800
I need some more water.

6712
05:10:22,140 --> 05:10:23,740
I'm so locked in.

6713
05:10:24,040 --> 05:10:25,540
I'm so locked in, guys.

6714
05:10:26,220 --> 05:10:27,800
I'm so locked in.

6715
05:10:28,440 --> 05:10:31,060
I'm pretty sure being in a call has made me less locked in.

6716
05:10:31,060 --> 05:10:32,420
But I'm so locked in.

6717
05:10:32,580 --> 05:10:33,680
Oh wait, they are in here.

6718
05:10:33,800 --> 05:10:35,360
Wait, there is a Fugi there.

6719
05:10:35,440 --> 05:10:38,940
I didn't even realize there was a Fugi there this entire time.

6720
05:10:39,700 --> 05:10:40,580
Which one is it?

6721
05:10:40,600 --> 05:10:40,880
Is it this one?

6722
05:10:42,880 --> 05:10:43,580
There you go.

6723
05:10:45,100 --> 05:10:46,280
That's them right there.

6724
05:10:46,500 --> 05:10:49,060
I want to use the icons, but like...

6725
05:10:50,520 --> 05:10:51,280
There you go.

6726
05:10:51,460 --> 05:10:52,040
That's them.

6727
05:11:02,010 --> 05:11:02,750
That's fine.

6728
05:11:03,150 --> 05:11:05,190
I can actually stream this for such long hours.

6729
05:11:05,190 --> 05:11:06,490
I just love...

6730
05:11:06,490 --> 05:11:08,650
I don't know what it is about competitive games.

6731
05:11:08,770 --> 05:11:11,610
I can literally stream competitive games for so fucking long.

6732
05:11:11,790 --> 05:11:15,170
Any team where we have one tank, I just can't play Magic.

6733
05:11:16,770 --> 05:11:18,270
Yeah, I think so too.

6734
05:11:20,870 --> 05:11:23,430
We've been just getting...

6735
05:11:23,430 --> 05:11:25,450
I don't think we've encountered a tank player.

6736
05:11:25,970 --> 05:11:28,610
Oh no, we definitely have not been encountering tank players.

6737
05:11:30,150 --> 05:11:31,530
We got a Lord Wolverine.

6738
05:11:34,170 --> 05:11:34,770
Fuck.

6739
05:11:35,790 --> 05:11:37,330
I mean, if you start to suck Lord...

6740
05:11:37,330 --> 05:11:39,530
If he's Wolverine and he starts to suck GM3...

6741
05:11:41,710 --> 05:11:43,350
Then there's problems.

6742
05:11:46,470 --> 05:11:48,970
Cause Wolverine is scary in higher elo.

6743
05:12:01,820 --> 05:12:02,360
Oops.

6744
05:12:02,680 --> 05:12:05,100
No accident opened.

6745
05:12:10,600 --> 05:12:11,080
Alright.

6746
05:12:13,200 --> 05:12:13,680
Fine.

6747
05:12:14,320 --> 05:12:15,740
Thank you for the 100 bitties.

6748
05:12:15,900 --> 05:12:17,680
Cosmic, thank you also for the 100 bitties.

6749
05:12:18,080 --> 05:12:20,440
And OldManShark, I thank you a thousand bitties.

6750
05:12:20,580 --> 05:12:20,800
Thank you.

6751
05:12:21,740 --> 05:12:23,760
Jokey, you have a rival's problem.

6752
05:12:23,880 --> 05:12:25,500
I see that's someone that's playing Destiny 2 for...

6753
05:12:25,500 --> 05:12:26,600
No, I agree.

6754
05:12:26,840 --> 05:12:27,300
I do.

6755
05:12:28,020 --> 05:12:29,120
It's not okay.

6756
05:12:29,320 --> 05:12:30,180
I'm not okay.

6757
05:12:31,860 --> 05:12:33,860
I'm also not locked in.

6758
05:12:34,100 --> 05:12:35,080
I was more locked in.

6759
05:12:35,080 --> 05:12:36,240
I was locked in in the first couple of games.

6760
05:12:36,360 --> 05:12:37,720
I was doing some crazy shit.

6761
05:12:38,180 --> 05:12:41,320
I was definitely doing some really fucking crazy shit.

6762
05:12:41,440 --> 05:12:42,400
In the first couple of games.

6763
05:12:42,800 --> 05:12:43,900
Now I'm just fucking around more.

6764
05:12:46,140 --> 05:12:47,620
Where is that?

6765
05:12:48,520 --> 05:12:48,920
Oh.

6766
05:12:50,040 --> 05:12:52,060
I've never seen a portal here before.

6767
05:12:52,820 --> 05:12:53,200
Oh.

6768
05:12:54,820 --> 05:12:55,420
What the?

6769
05:12:56,040 --> 05:12:57,340
Oh my god.

6770
05:12:57,440 --> 05:12:58,340
I don't like this.

6771
05:12:58,680 --> 05:13:02,720
Wait, I forgot they can just break our high ground.

6772
05:13:03,200 --> 05:13:05,480
Wolverine killed their tank, but he killed himself too.

6773
05:13:07,600 --> 05:13:09,160
Hulk is so low.

6774
05:13:09,740 --> 05:13:11,700
I'm getting slammed in the back.

6775
05:13:11,840 --> 05:13:13,300
There's a Jiff behind us.

6776
05:13:13,840 --> 05:13:14,920
Yeah, the flanking Jiff.

6777
05:13:15,020 --> 05:13:15,940
That dude is a demon.

6778
05:13:17,140 --> 05:13:18,180
Alright, nice.

6779
05:13:18,820 --> 05:13:19,380
He's back.

6780
05:13:21,660 --> 05:13:23,740
Oh my god, you guys got the golden cap back.

6781
05:13:26,000 --> 05:13:28,880
Oh my god, I'm going this way.

6782
05:13:29,340 --> 05:13:30,560
I went the wrong way.

6783
05:13:30,560 --> 05:13:33,060
I was debating which way to go.

6784
05:13:33,960 --> 05:13:36,800
Their Hulk's name is fuck overwatch 2?

6785
05:13:37,780 --> 05:13:38,820
Nice, I agree.

6786
05:13:39,440 --> 05:13:41,580
Honestly, so fucking true.

6787
05:13:44,140 --> 05:13:46,500
I like that game.

6788
05:13:48,600 --> 05:13:49,780
Everything is fine.

6789
05:13:52,540 --> 05:13:54,860
There's a lot of things above us.

6790
05:13:55,000 --> 05:13:57,920
Oh my god, what happened to our strange?

6791
05:13:57,920 --> 05:13:59,660
What happened to you?

6792
05:14:00,200 --> 05:14:02,300
They kept running me over and I kept backing up.

6793
05:14:02,400 --> 05:14:03,180
And I kept getting exploded.

6794
05:14:03,180 --> 05:14:04,620
I'm just going to die on point.

6795
05:14:12,620 --> 05:14:16,100
Jesus Christ, they like ran at us so fast.

6796
05:14:16,760 --> 05:14:20,160
Yeah, I tried backing up, but ow.

6797
05:14:20,700 --> 05:14:22,180
I'm your solo tank, dude.

6798
05:14:22,200 --> 05:14:23,020
What could you do?

6799
05:14:23,960 --> 05:14:24,440
Ow.

6800
05:14:25,200 --> 05:14:27,440
They have Jeff ult, by the way.

6801
05:14:28,860 --> 05:14:29,660
Oh my god.

6802
05:14:29,660 --> 05:14:30,160
So like...

6803
05:14:30,160 --> 05:14:33,900
Oh my god.

6804
05:14:34,240 --> 05:14:35,460
Raccoon, are you okay?

6805
05:14:38,900 --> 05:14:39,860
I might die.

6806
05:14:40,280 --> 05:14:42,360
We can push up.

6807
05:14:45,550 --> 05:14:47,830
Bro, what the...

6808
05:14:47,830 --> 05:14:48,230
Okay.

6809
05:14:50,670 --> 05:14:51,470
Goodbye.

6810
05:14:51,990 --> 05:14:53,270
The raccoon and I both...

6811
05:14:53,270 --> 05:14:54,770
He's going to jump off.

6812
05:14:54,770 --> 05:14:55,950
He's going to jump off.

6813
05:14:56,090 --> 05:14:58,170
He's going to jump off.

6814
05:14:58,250 --> 05:14:58,630
It's fine.

6815
05:14:59,250 --> 05:15:00,710
You guys got the point, right?

6816
05:15:01,610 --> 05:15:04,150
You guys got the point.

6817
05:15:04,310 --> 05:15:04,970
That's fine.

6818
05:15:06,570 --> 05:15:07,230
Oh, they portaled.

6819
05:15:07,290 --> 05:15:07,990
You have no support.

6820
05:15:08,150 --> 05:15:11,390
Oh, it's just two of you.

6821
05:15:11,510 --> 05:15:11,930
We're coming back.

6822
05:15:12,130 --> 05:15:15,710
We're coming back.

6823
05:15:15,790 --> 05:15:16,990
I can ult on.

6824
05:15:18,190 --> 05:15:19,030
Guys, I'm scared.

6825
05:15:19,690 --> 05:15:20,250
You're fine.

6826
05:15:20,250 --> 05:15:20,890
You're fine.

6827
05:15:20,910 --> 05:15:22,270
I have orb on you.

6828
05:15:23,690 --> 05:15:25,030
Kill the fish guy!

6829
05:15:25,490 --> 05:15:26,850
Fish is to your right.

6830
05:15:28,510 --> 05:15:29,650
Kill the other fish!

6831
05:15:29,930 --> 05:15:31,370
Get Dr.Shane!

6832
05:15:31,430 --> 05:15:32,270
Dr.Shane is behind you!

6833
05:15:33,950 --> 05:15:34,830
He's like...

6834
05:15:34,830 --> 05:15:37,030
He has no shield, but...

6835
05:15:37,030 --> 05:15:38,030
He's getting healed now.

6836
05:15:39,010 --> 05:15:43,170
I got you, Mac.

6837
05:15:45,590 --> 05:15:47,530
I'm just using this as cover for now.

6838
05:15:47,530 --> 05:15:48,790
He has...

6839
05:15:48,790 --> 05:15:49,430
Oh, shit!

6840
05:15:50,290 --> 05:15:51,330
I canceled his I.

6841
05:15:52,170 --> 05:15:53,730
I got you.

6842
05:15:55,670 --> 05:15:56,150
Ironman!

6843
05:15:59,130 --> 05:16:00,550
And there's no more above.

6844
05:16:01,190 --> 05:16:02,570
I'm not going to ult.

6845
05:16:02,610 --> 05:16:03,290
I'm going to die on point.

6846
05:16:04,030 --> 05:16:05,590
I'm going to go beat up the Namor.

6847
05:16:05,750 --> 05:16:06,350
How dare he.

6848
05:16:07,610 --> 05:16:09,110
I'm going to eat some fucking fish.

6849
05:16:09,250 --> 05:16:09,930
That's for sure.

6850
05:16:12,850 --> 05:16:15,830
I started hating things more after Marvel Rivals.

6851
05:16:15,830 --> 05:16:19,510
There's so many things I realize I fucking hate in this world.

6852
05:16:21,630 --> 05:16:23,950
Shane just turned you into a turbo pessimist.

6853
05:16:24,670 --> 05:16:25,110
Yeah!

6854
05:16:25,470 --> 05:16:26,290
I was like, you know what?

6855
05:16:26,310 --> 05:16:27,410
I'm glad the world's dying.

6856
05:16:30,290 --> 05:16:31,010
You know what?

6857
05:16:31,070 --> 05:16:34,490
We should dump more barrels of oil into the ocean, I think.

6858
05:16:35,390 --> 05:16:37,310
No, BP!

6859
05:16:37,530 --> 05:16:38,690
Maybe they're not so bad.

6860
05:16:40,590 --> 05:16:41,370
You know what?

6861
05:16:41,370 --> 05:16:42,570
I see their point now.

6862
05:16:42,630 --> 05:16:43,310
I get it.

6863
05:16:44,150 --> 05:16:45,630
I understand now.

6864
05:16:45,670 --> 05:16:46,670
I understand.

6865
05:16:48,430 --> 05:16:49,230
Dude, honestly.

6866
05:16:49,590 --> 05:16:50,370
Fuck it, dude.

6867
05:16:50,930 --> 05:16:52,730
More drink rings in the ocean.

6868
05:16:53,570 --> 05:16:54,950
Oh, I hate that!

6869
05:16:56,250 --> 05:16:58,090
That's a whole another level.

6870
05:16:58,490 --> 05:16:59,150
I'm just saying.

6871
05:17:00,830 --> 05:17:03,790
I'm not one to use plastic straws again, dude.

6872
05:17:04,050 --> 05:17:08,270
So an oil spill in the ocean is fine, but plastic rings is where we draw the line.

6873
05:17:08,490 --> 05:17:09,550
I get it now.

6874
05:17:09,850 --> 05:17:11,530
I fucking get it.

6875
05:17:13,310 --> 05:17:15,250
There's only one guy who wants to take my portal.

6876
05:17:15,310 --> 05:17:15,690
You know what?

6877
05:17:15,790 --> 05:17:17,630
You didn't say anything!

6878
05:17:18,190 --> 05:17:19,630
I'm on Strange.

6879
05:17:19,630 --> 05:17:21,490
I said it by picking Strange.

6880
05:17:22,730 --> 05:17:24,270
I didn't know you had your cooldown.

6881
05:17:27,170 --> 05:17:28,730
I think I'm going to use my oil early.

6882
05:17:28,830 --> 05:17:30,170
There's a shark up here.

6883
05:17:30,270 --> 05:17:32,390
Bro, there's a shark in the skybox.

6884
05:17:33,470 --> 05:17:34,610
I literally, I can't.

6885
05:17:34,670 --> 05:17:36,370
I need to use my health pack.

6886
05:17:38,190 --> 05:17:40,230
There's a flanking shark behind us.

6887
05:17:41,950 --> 05:17:43,470
Why did I get...

6888
05:17:43,470 --> 05:17:45,110
Please, please, live.

6889
05:17:45,350 --> 05:17:45,610
Nice.

6890
05:17:46,010 --> 05:17:49,470
If you need heals, just go into my dance.

6891
05:17:49,650 --> 05:17:50,710
Just dance with me.

6892
05:17:51,170 --> 05:17:51,970
I'm dancing.

6893
05:17:52,290 --> 05:17:53,090
I'm shaking ass.

6894
05:17:53,350 --> 05:17:53,890
There's Jeff.

6895
05:17:53,910 --> 05:17:55,030
Jeff has ult, by the way.

6896
05:17:55,110 --> 05:17:56,110
Jeff is looking for it.

6897
05:17:56,130 --> 05:17:57,650
I am throwing it back.

6898
05:17:58,810 --> 05:18:00,390
I froze Magneto.

6899
05:18:00,990 --> 05:18:02,330
Oh, no.

6900
05:18:02,950 --> 05:18:03,890
They broke it.

6901
05:18:03,930 --> 05:18:04,490
They broke it.

6902
05:18:04,790 --> 05:18:06,110
What do I do?

6903
05:18:06,790 --> 05:18:08,570
What if I win these, though?

6904
05:18:10,470 --> 05:18:10,830
Just die on point.

6905
05:18:11,110 --> 05:18:11,830
Just die on point.

6906
05:18:15,290 --> 05:18:17,390
I got beat up by Hulk behind me.

6907
05:18:17,450 --> 05:18:18,230
I didn't even notice.

6908
05:18:20,970 --> 05:18:22,250
I don't know how to give you orbs.

6909
05:18:24,890 --> 05:18:26,930
I feel like we should just ban Hulk.

6910
05:18:27,610 --> 05:18:28,550
Hulk guy and Hulk.

6911
05:18:28,670 --> 05:18:29,710
That's all I care about now.

6912
05:18:30,110 --> 05:18:32,750
If hell is open, I'll diff whoever's on it.

6913
05:18:33,310 --> 05:18:34,370
I got my hope for this fight.

6914
05:18:34,450 --> 05:18:35,010
We can win this.

6915
05:18:35,710 --> 05:18:40,430
I can't deal with Hulk anymore.

6916
05:18:42,630 --> 05:18:45,110
Yo, what is this guy doing over here?

6917
05:18:45,230 --> 05:18:46,670
He's just sticking to the wall.

6918
05:18:51,730 --> 05:18:54,810
I thought that wall was going to save me.

6919
05:18:55,310 --> 05:18:56,570
And that's why I hid there.

6920
05:18:57,130 --> 05:18:59,230
But I realized it did not.

6921
05:19:00,610 --> 05:19:01,730
Yes, you are.

6922
05:19:01,730 --> 05:19:04,310
Yes, you are.

6923
05:19:04,890 --> 05:19:04,990
Nope.

6924
05:19:09,610 --> 05:19:10,990
Jesus Christ.

6925
05:19:11,250 --> 05:19:12,770
Please look at me.

6926
05:19:16,610 --> 05:19:18,910
We're running over.

6927
05:19:19,570 --> 05:19:21,150
We're up too.

6928
05:19:21,270 --> 05:19:21,910
We should just go.

6929
05:19:27,430 --> 05:19:28,970
I forced Luna ult.

6930
05:19:29,630 --> 05:19:31,650
I forced Luna ult.

6931
05:19:32,390 --> 05:19:33,770
I'm going to ult after this.

6932
05:19:39,740 --> 05:19:40,820
You're going to get eaten.

6933
05:19:42,300 --> 05:19:43,100
I'm getting eaten.

6934
05:19:43,280 --> 05:19:44,120
Goodbye, I guess.

6935
05:19:44,800 --> 05:19:45,280
He's not.

6936
05:19:45,340 --> 05:19:47,200
He's like 170 HP.

6937
05:19:47,420 --> 05:19:47,860
He's 140.

6938
05:19:48,680 --> 05:19:49,900
He blew me up.

6939
05:19:50,620 --> 05:19:51,240
He blew you?

6940
05:19:51,380 --> 05:19:52,280
He blew me up.

6941
05:19:52,420 --> 05:19:52,960
You did what?

6942
05:19:54,360 --> 05:19:54,980
We're up.

6943
05:19:55,120 --> 05:19:55,400
We're up.

6944
05:19:55,540 --> 05:19:55,740
We're up.

6945
05:19:55,980 --> 05:19:57,340
You have a freaky ass shark.

6946
05:19:58,960 --> 05:19:59,800
Oh no.

6947
05:20:00,520 --> 05:20:01,260
I blocked it.

6948
05:20:01,300 --> 05:20:02,080
I can't get out of this hole.

6949
05:20:02,080 --> 05:20:03,020
No you didn't.

6950
05:20:03,080 --> 05:20:04,340
I died next to you.

6951
05:20:09,300 --> 05:20:10,320
You're by yourself.

6952
05:20:10,420 --> 05:20:13,060
I killed their Luna.

6953
05:20:15,540 --> 05:20:16,680
We don't need to regroup.

6954
05:20:18,160 --> 05:20:19,220
But we don't have time to regroup.

6955
05:20:24,200 --> 05:20:26,600
I'll save the ult first.

6956
05:20:26,820 --> 05:20:27,360
Next fight.

6957
05:20:27,460 --> 05:20:29,260
I don't think it's worth...

6958
05:20:30,340 --> 05:20:32,260
I don't think it's worth using my ult here.

6959
05:20:33,640 --> 05:20:34,020
I agree.

6960
05:20:34,200 --> 05:20:34,840
Good call.

6961
05:20:35,880 --> 05:20:38,380
I don't think we would have won that.

6962
05:20:39,520 --> 05:20:43,940
Alright, so our Lord Wolverine is rocking a steady even KD.

6963
05:20:44,100 --> 05:20:46,100
I'm going to need this guy to start doing God's work.

6964
05:20:46,380 --> 05:20:51,360
I gave him orb, but he's not doing anything with it.

6965
05:20:52,240 --> 05:20:52,720
Yeah.

6966
05:20:53,700 --> 05:20:55,460
Yeah, you know where to put the orb.

6967
05:20:55,980 --> 05:20:56,740
Yeah, I'll just put it in.

6968
05:20:56,740 --> 05:20:57,760
You don't know?

6969
05:20:58,620 --> 05:21:00,160
I didn't have to say anything.

6970
05:21:00,160 --> 05:21:02,360
I thought he'd do something.

6971
05:21:02,540 --> 05:21:06,180
I mean, I stopped giving him orb this round, but...

6972
05:21:06,180 --> 05:21:08,320
Yeah, he's just not doing anything.

6973
05:21:10,080 --> 05:21:11,360
Oh, we have two tanks now.

6974
05:21:11,500 --> 05:21:11,840
Nice.

6975
05:21:12,480 --> 05:21:13,700
Oh my god, finally!

6976
05:21:14,240 --> 05:21:16,400
Okay, your orb privileges are gone.

6977
05:21:16,540 --> 05:21:18,520
Did you guys see this robot playing the bongos?

6978
05:21:19,940 --> 05:21:21,440
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

6979
05:21:21,920 --> 05:21:23,120
Nothing, he's just chilling.

6980
05:21:23,920 --> 05:21:26,540
I'm putting the orb on the tanks.

6981
05:21:26,760 --> 05:21:28,180
Sorry, they gotta live.

6982
05:21:28,180 --> 05:21:29,260
Oh, okay.

6983
05:21:29,480 --> 05:21:32,060
I'll give it to you first to see how you do it.

6984
05:21:32,180 --> 05:21:33,960
If you don't get a pick, it's going back to the tanks.

6985
05:21:34,160 --> 05:21:34,460
Portal!

6986
05:21:38,300 --> 05:21:39,380
Goodbye, Starlord.

6987
05:21:44,050 --> 05:21:44,670
I'm coming back.

6988
05:21:44,850 --> 05:21:45,770
Oh, I saw the Jeff.

6989
05:21:47,110 --> 05:21:47,990
Fuck him up!

6990
05:21:48,430 --> 05:21:49,390
Kill the shark!

6991
05:21:50,530 --> 05:21:51,390
Get his ass!

6992
05:21:52,450 --> 05:21:54,430
Please, he baited you guys.

6993
05:21:54,630 --> 05:21:56,090
And now we might...

6994
05:21:56,090 --> 05:21:58,010
No, I'm back on the hype.

6995
05:21:58,010 --> 05:21:59,910
Oh my god, Jeff.

6996
05:22:00,350 --> 05:22:02,850
Guys, he literally baited you guys.

6997
05:22:03,190 --> 05:22:04,090
Please, come back!

6998
05:22:04,210 --> 05:22:04,770
Why did you walk away?

6999
05:22:06,170 --> 05:22:08,510
Why did you walk away?

7000
05:22:09,010 --> 05:22:09,470
I do.

7001
05:22:10,410 --> 05:22:11,010
Oh my god.

7002
05:22:11,870 --> 05:22:12,690
Oopsie daisies.

7003
05:22:13,610 --> 05:22:15,830
Your ult blended in with the floor.

7004
05:22:16,350 --> 05:22:17,230
Oh my god.

7005
05:22:18,630 --> 05:22:19,750
Oopsie daisies.

7006
05:22:20,710 --> 05:22:21,210
Really?

7007
05:22:21,430 --> 05:22:22,710
My bad.

7008
05:22:24,330 --> 05:22:26,410
There's a Hulk who is scaring me.

7009
05:22:26,410 --> 05:22:29,190
He made me not want to be near him anymore.

7010
05:22:29,330 --> 05:22:32,150
Guys, I don't think this is a climbing stack anymore.

7011
05:22:32,770 --> 05:22:34,250
No, no, no, no, no.

7012
05:22:34,950 --> 05:22:37,610
I don't think this is a climbing stack.

7013
05:22:44,210 --> 05:22:45,770
Hulk to my right, Hulk!

7014
05:22:46,230 --> 05:22:47,610
Oh my god.

7015
05:22:49,870 --> 05:22:51,110
Give me the flake.

7016
05:22:52,370 --> 05:22:53,870
Give me the snow.

7017
05:22:54,730 --> 05:22:55,970
Got my one.

7018
05:22:56,250 --> 05:22:57,230
Oh my god.

7019
05:22:57,230 --> 05:22:58,670
What the fuck?

7020
05:22:59,030 --> 05:23:00,550
I'm a man.

7021
05:23:00,650 --> 05:23:01,870
Yeah, you are.

7022
05:23:03,150 --> 05:23:04,350
Yo, look at me, Neo.

7023
05:23:04,710 --> 05:23:06,430
Yeah, you are.

7024
05:23:06,970 --> 05:23:07,370
Okay.

7025
05:23:10,450 --> 05:23:12,610
Yo, I need care.

7026
05:23:12,990 --> 05:23:14,370
I'm getting shit on.

7027
05:23:14,810 --> 05:23:16,670
Guys, I'm getting...

7028
05:23:16,670 --> 05:23:17,290
Fuck me, dude.

7029
05:23:18,530 --> 05:23:21,350
I got so ulted by the Iron Man in the sky.

7030
05:23:26,410 --> 05:23:27,210
There is...

7031
05:23:27,210 --> 05:23:28,430
Ruben, you're fine.

7032
05:23:28,550 --> 05:23:29,430
You're so healthy.

7033
05:23:30,570 --> 05:23:31,750
Wait, he's one, he's one, he's one.

7034
05:23:33,890 --> 05:23:34,290
Why?

7035
05:23:34,690 --> 05:23:35,590
I never...

7036
05:23:35,590 --> 05:23:37,070
I always get so ulted.

7037
05:23:37,190 --> 05:23:38,070
I'm so sad.

7038
05:23:40,710 --> 05:23:41,630
I'm shitting on them.

7039
05:23:42,310 --> 05:23:44,430
Oh wait, that was such a good ult, Ruben.

7040
05:23:44,790 --> 05:23:46,170
I fucking swear!

7041
05:23:46,970 --> 05:23:47,810
Yo, guys, watch out.

7042
05:23:47,850 --> 05:23:48,250
There's a jam.

7043
05:23:48,290 --> 05:23:49,450
No, Iron Man's one.

7044
05:23:50,670 --> 05:23:50,910
No!

7045
05:23:50,910 --> 05:23:51,310
No!

7046
05:23:52,750 --> 05:23:53,650
Yo, no supports.

7047
05:23:54,290 --> 05:23:55,470
But they also have one support.

7048
05:23:56,910 --> 05:23:58,750
That was both their supports, so be careful.

7049
05:23:59,290 --> 05:23:59,530
Yep.

7050
05:24:01,690 --> 05:24:02,370
I think they're portaling.

7051
05:24:03,150 --> 05:24:03,590
Care portal.

7052
05:24:04,550 --> 05:24:05,330
I'm so sad.

7053
05:24:05,430 --> 05:24:05,890
I'm coming over.

7054
05:24:05,910 --> 05:24:06,850
I'm coming over with...

7055
05:24:06,850 --> 05:24:08,290
I'm gonna ult on the point.

7056
05:24:09,590 --> 05:24:10,950
I'm gonna just live.

7057
05:24:10,970 --> 05:24:12,190
Just live and I'll ult on the point.

7058
05:24:12,450 --> 05:24:14,070
I am living so hard right now.

7059
05:24:14,710 --> 05:24:15,470
There we go.

7060
05:24:15,830 --> 05:24:17,690
Just fucking brawl it out, I guess.

7061
05:24:17,690 --> 05:24:19,550
No, Namor's one.

7062
05:24:19,950 --> 05:24:21,310
Their Luna is still low.

7063
05:24:21,330 --> 05:24:23,770
Their Luna's literally right there, just running away!

7064
05:24:26,470 --> 05:24:27,030
Please!

7065
05:24:27,110 --> 05:24:28,110
Oh my god, I'll kill her.

7066
05:24:30,270 --> 05:24:32,530
I guess I'll do the job.

7067
05:24:33,350 --> 05:24:35,030
I'll do it myself.

7068
05:24:36,130 --> 05:24:36,950
That Magneto's one.

7069
05:24:37,050 --> 05:24:38,650
They have no supports.

7070
05:24:40,810 --> 05:24:42,330
That's a fucking lie.

7071
05:24:44,510 --> 05:24:45,310
Yup, beautiful.

7072
05:24:45,310 --> 05:24:45,770
Oh shit.

7073
05:24:46,430 --> 05:24:48,730
Honestly, I might be the strange goat.

7074
05:24:51,110 --> 05:24:56,370
62% Yeah, maybe the best range North America.

7075
05:24:56,670 --> 05:24:57,530
What can I say?

7076
05:25:00,110 --> 05:25:04,250
Is this live or pre-recorded?

7077
05:25:06,030 --> 05:25:08,650
Oh my god.

7078
05:25:11,230 --> 05:25:12,850
Oh my god.

7079
05:25:13,730 --> 05:25:14,630
Oh my god.

7080
05:25:15,410 --> 05:25:20,230
Oh, you're now gonna be- Oh my god, I'm freaking avoiding our Wolverine.

7081
05:25:20,230 --> 05:25:22,410
I'm avoiding our Wolverine.

7082
05:25:23,570 --> 05:25:25,190
There's no way.

7083
05:25:27,450 --> 05:25:29,590
There's no fucking way.

7084
05:25:32,010 --> 05:25:34,110
What a good guy.

7085
05:25:53,230 --> 05:25:53,630
Alright.

7086
05:25:54,610 --> 05:25:56,850
Guys, this is where the win streak starts, right?

7087
05:25:57,090 --> 05:25:58,370
Can you stop the queue?

7088
05:25:58,450 --> 05:25:59,130
I need to go pee.

7089
05:26:00,170 --> 05:26:01,670
How long is the pee gonna be?

7090
05:26:01,790 --> 05:26:02,350
You're gonna make it.

7091
05:26:04,890 --> 05:26:06,210
Just do it fast.

7092
05:26:06,390 --> 05:26:06,970
Just do it fast.

7093
05:26:07,470 --> 05:26:09,710
No, just do it fast.

7094
05:26:11,350 --> 05:26:13,510
How long do you fucking pee?

7095
05:26:13,690 --> 05:26:15,830
Dude, I washed my hands.

7096
05:26:17,170 --> 05:26:17,570
So?

7097
05:26:18,770 --> 05:26:19,970
We have bands.

7098
05:26:19,970 --> 05:26:21,230
We literally have two bands.

7099
05:26:22,130 --> 05:26:22,610
Nah,

7100
05:26:26,150 --> 05:26:27,790
he's gonna be fucking squirming in his seat.

7101
05:26:27,990 --> 05:26:29,210
This is not good.

7102
05:26:30,690 --> 05:26:31,690
Oh my god.

7103
05:26:31,730 --> 05:26:33,250
Try to win this game as fast as possible.

7104
05:26:33,370 --> 05:26:35,510
Oh my god, just freaking pee.

7105
05:26:36,010 --> 05:26:38,310
Like, I pee in between queues too.

7106
05:26:38,750 --> 05:26:43,070
No, we got the- Oh my god, remember that guy?

7107
05:26:43,150 --> 05:26:44,170
The Mickey Poo guy?

7108
05:26:45,390 --> 05:26:47,370
He was not great.

7109
05:26:47,370 --> 05:26:50,230
I think I removed him from my brain to protect myself.

7110
05:26:50,550 --> 05:26:54,490
He was not doing that great.

7111
05:26:55,130 --> 05:26:55,790
What did he play?

7112
05:26:56,210 --> 05:26:57,910
He did not do so well.

7113
05:26:58,090 --> 05:27:00,170
He was a Black Panther.

7114
05:27:01,130 --> 05:27:05,390
And he had very low DPS damage.

7115
05:27:07,330 --> 05:27:08,630
Wait, somebody DC'd.

7116
05:27:10,030 --> 05:27:10,970
I think it's you.

7117
05:27:11,090 --> 05:27:12,030
I don't see your bar.

7118
05:27:12,290 --> 05:27:14,750
Your bar just didn't move.

7119
05:27:14,750 --> 05:27:17,530
Your bar and someone on the enemy team's bar hasn't moved.

7120
05:27:18,010 --> 05:27:20,990
You know what?

7121
05:27:21,110 --> 05:27:22,010
Maybe I can pee.

7122
05:27:22,170 --> 05:27:23,330
Alright, alright.

7123
05:27:23,810 --> 05:27:25,990
I'm reconnecting.

7124
05:27:26,190 --> 05:27:27,510
It was me.

7125
05:27:28,490 --> 05:27:29,470
It was me.

7126
05:27:30,990 --> 05:27:33,130
I was like, huh?

7127
05:27:33,610 --> 05:27:35,050
It was me all along.

7128
05:27:35,490 --> 05:27:38,030
I got scared there for a second.

7129
05:27:40,490 --> 05:27:41,470
That was scary.

7130
05:27:45,690 --> 05:27:46,810
How did I...

7131
05:27:46,810 --> 05:27:48,350
I've never had that happen before.

7132
05:28:01,420 --> 05:28:02,940
Yeah, fuck Hawkeye.

7133
05:28:11,930 --> 05:28:13,630
We should ban Doctor Strange.

7134
05:28:14,310 --> 05:28:14,810
Or Hulk?

7135
05:28:14,930 --> 05:28:16,350
Do you think they have a Hulk player though?

7136
05:28:16,810 --> 05:28:18,990
No, I just don't want to gamble.

7137
05:28:19,130 --> 05:28:20,010
I just hate Hulk.

7138
05:28:20,270 --> 05:28:22,310
I'm sick and tired of that fucking character.

7139
05:28:22,430 --> 05:28:24,150
I'm tired of playing against Hulk too.

7140
05:28:25,490 --> 05:28:27,030
You're gonna have a Strange then.

7141
05:28:27,890 --> 05:28:28,750
That's fine.

7142
05:28:28,750 --> 05:28:31,530
I think I'd rather play against Strange than Hulk.

7143
05:28:32,710 --> 05:28:34,690
Why is my Starlord banned?

7144
05:28:37,270 --> 05:28:38,550
Stream sniping?

7145
05:28:40,430 --> 05:28:41,890
Who's got a tab up?

7146
05:28:42,490 --> 05:28:44,830
I just started playing him three games ago.

7147
05:28:45,330 --> 05:28:46,110
What the fuck?

7148
05:28:46,750 --> 05:28:49,430
I like how he just locked the magic after that.

7149
05:28:54,110 --> 05:28:55,810
Maybe stream sniping?

7150
05:29:01,880 --> 05:29:03,500
Wait, we didn't ban Hulk?

7151
05:29:04,540 --> 05:29:05,200
What the fuck?

7152
05:29:05,320 --> 05:29:05,880
Yeah, you can play Psy.

7153
05:29:05,980 --> 05:29:06,840
Oh wait, no.

7154
05:29:07,860 --> 05:29:10,240
Why do we have so many DPS players?

7155
05:29:10,340 --> 05:29:11,280
Okay, I'll go support.

7156
05:29:11,640 --> 05:29:13,080
Unless Mac wants to trade.

7157
05:29:16,880 --> 05:29:17,700
Alright, Mac.

7158
05:29:17,840 --> 05:29:18,980
Do you think...

7159
05:29:18,980 --> 05:29:19,640
What do we want?

7160
05:29:19,680 --> 05:29:20,900
Magic or Psylocke?

7161
05:29:21,240 --> 05:29:22,940
This is all up to you to decide.

7162
05:29:23,400 --> 05:29:23,680
You can go Psylocke.

7163
05:29:26,180 --> 05:29:27,140
Thank you!

7164
05:29:27,140 --> 05:29:28,680
You owe him.

7165
05:29:28,840 --> 05:29:29,400
I'll make you proud.

7166
05:29:31,340 --> 05:29:32,960
I'll make you proud.

7167
05:29:33,040 --> 05:29:35,000
If we lose, we never let Ruben play.

7168
05:29:35,240 --> 05:29:36,680
There is no if.

7169
05:29:36,880 --> 05:29:39,460
There is no if we lose because we will win.

7170
05:29:40,100 --> 05:29:41,180
We will win.

7171
05:29:42,200 --> 05:29:42,760
Okay.

7172
05:29:47,780 --> 05:29:48,340
Alright.

7173
05:29:49,540 --> 05:29:53,640
I'm a little scared of Penny Solotank, but...

7174
05:29:53,640 --> 05:29:57,460
Okay guys, I can't mute myself because I realize it's my damage boost.

7175
05:29:57,800 --> 05:29:58,420
Alright, here we go.

7176
05:30:00,960 --> 05:30:02,240
Yeah, that's...

7177
05:30:05,140 --> 05:30:07,400
Why did we not ban Hulk?

7178
05:30:08,040 --> 05:30:08,560
Yep.

7179
05:30:08,860 --> 05:30:10,760
Who would have thought Hulk was open?

7180
05:30:11,600 --> 05:30:13,560
My whole time, man.

7181
05:30:13,680 --> 05:30:14,860
On a good map for it.

7182
05:30:17,200 --> 05:30:18,280
Oh my god.

7183
05:30:22,200 --> 05:30:23,720
I'm damage boosting.

7184
05:30:23,720 --> 05:30:25,780
I'm breaking the red beacon.

7185
05:30:27,280 --> 05:30:27,760
Punisher.

7186
05:30:27,820 --> 05:30:29,060
Punisher, I'm gonna give you infinite on this corner.

7187
05:30:29,700 --> 05:30:30,020
Yeah.

7188
05:30:32,200 --> 05:30:33,720
I have damage boosting in here.

7189
05:30:34,420 --> 05:30:35,200
They're all so low.

7190
05:30:35,260 --> 05:30:36,220
They're all so low in there.

7191
05:30:40,320 --> 05:30:43,020
We can't, like, progress because...

7192
05:30:43,580 --> 05:30:44,420
I got slapped.

7193
05:30:45,120 --> 05:30:46,060
The turret's one.

7194
05:30:49,660 --> 05:30:51,020
They're all so low.

7195
05:30:52,040 --> 05:30:53,280
I can't heal you up there.

7196
05:30:53,280 --> 05:30:54,640
I'm okay, I'm okay.

7197
05:30:54,820 --> 05:30:57,280
Okay, I'm just gonna try and keep our...

7198
05:30:59,460 --> 05:31:00,260
They're like...

7199
05:31:00,260 --> 05:31:01,160
Oh, just change his ult!

7200
05:31:02,820 --> 05:31:04,400
They're gonna get rez here.

7201
05:31:05,020 --> 05:31:05,180
I think.

7202
05:31:06,460 --> 05:31:08,040
Hulk, burn Hulk, burn Hulk, burn Hulk.

7203
05:31:09,220 --> 05:31:10,640
Oh, it's unlucky.

7204
05:31:10,820 --> 05:31:11,180
I'm asleep.

7205
05:31:11,960 --> 05:31:15,300
Wait, how did you not get rezzed?

7206
05:31:16,240 --> 05:31:17,060
I just didn't.

7207
05:31:17,280 --> 05:31:17,800
Alright, manair.

7208
05:31:18,780 --> 05:31:20,480
My rez has been down the whole time.

7209
05:31:21,680 --> 05:31:23,100
Does it have a radius on it?

7210
05:31:23,420 --> 05:31:24,220
I think it might.

7211
05:31:25,120 --> 05:31:26,540
Because I was pretty deep in their background.

7212
05:31:26,820 --> 05:31:28,200
I don't know, I don't really play Rocket that much.

7213
05:31:28,960 --> 05:31:30,000
I don't know, I understand.

7214
05:31:30,000 --> 05:31:31,380
I think you've got a good hang of him.

7215
05:31:32,160 --> 05:31:33,020
Alright, nice.

7216
05:31:34,180 --> 05:31:37,000
I'm damage boosting this random guy.

7217
05:31:42,750 --> 05:31:47,330
Alright, I might go in and out of mute because my mute button is F and I need damage boost.

7218
05:31:47,890 --> 05:31:48,590
Okay, bad.

7219
05:31:52,430 --> 05:31:58,350
F is my self damage boost, so there is a chance that I might go in and out.

7220
05:31:59,630 --> 05:32:01,010
Okay, they used M.O.

7221
05:32:04,830 --> 05:32:05,310
Okay.

7222
05:32:06,170 --> 05:32:07,130
I have ult here.

7223
05:32:07,830 --> 05:32:08,590
I'm backing up.

7224
05:32:10,010 --> 05:32:11,790
They fucked up the fish.

7225
05:32:14,090 --> 05:32:15,270
Oh, there's the Hulk over there.

7226
05:32:16,230 --> 05:32:17,310
Left side Hulk, oh wait.

7227
05:32:17,510 --> 05:32:19,770
Hulk is low, Hulk is low.

7228
05:32:23,990 --> 05:32:25,390
Ulti in front of us, snowball, okay?

7229
05:32:26,710 --> 05:32:27,750
I'm ulting for him.

7230
05:32:27,830 --> 05:32:28,650
Just snowball up on us.

7231
05:32:29,390 --> 05:32:31,950
I'm pushing cart, I'm pushing cart.

7232
05:32:33,250 --> 05:32:34,130
We need...

7233
05:32:34,130 --> 05:32:35,670
No, that was behind us!

7234
05:32:36,210 --> 05:32:37,810
I die out of my shift.

7235
05:32:38,270 --> 05:32:38,410
Yeah.

7236
05:32:39,690 --> 05:32:40,450
Can we cap it?

7237
05:32:41,230 --> 05:32:43,010
Can we still cap it maybe?

7238
05:32:43,230 --> 05:32:43,370
Yes.

7239
05:32:44,370 --> 05:32:45,290
This is winnable, this is winnable.

7240
05:32:46,430 --> 05:32:46,870
Nice.

7241
05:32:50,270 --> 05:32:51,330
Wait, everybody split up.

7242
05:32:51,330 --> 05:32:52,330
Wait, what?

7243
05:32:53,370 --> 05:32:54,630
Why did all you guys split up?

7244
05:32:55,170 --> 05:32:55,930
I'm going right side.

7245
05:32:57,110 --> 05:32:58,570
I think everybody came back though.

7246
05:33:00,790 --> 05:33:01,250
No!

7247
05:33:02,930 --> 05:33:03,850
I thought...

7248
05:33:03,850 --> 05:33:04,270
I'm dead.

7249
05:33:05,170 --> 05:33:06,170
The damage boost to you?

7250
05:33:06,850 --> 05:33:08,950
I have a Hulk trying to run at me.

7251
05:33:10,230 --> 05:33:11,650
I wanted to save.

7252
05:33:12,170 --> 05:33:12,610
I slept him.

7253
05:33:13,730 --> 05:33:14,630
Hulk is one, Hulk is one.

7254
05:33:15,390 --> 05:33:16,090
It's fine.

7255
05:33:17,910 --> 05:33:18,510
Oh, he's solo.

7256
05:33:18,510 --> 05:33:20,390
Dude, this Mantis just ran me down.

7257
05:33:21,670 --> 05:33:22,210
It's fine.

7258
05:33:23,410 --> 05:33:24,410
It's not fine.

7259
05:33:24,570 --> 05:33:25,650
I don't have enough heals for you.

7260
05:33:25,970 --> 05:33:26,830
Hulk one, Hulk one.

7261
05:33:27,430 --> 05:33:28,130
Dead, bro.

7262
05:33:28,830 --> 05:33:30,530
I don't know what you want, we're dead.

7263
05:33:31,650 --> 05:33:33,810
There's definitely a Mantis right behind you.

7264
05:33:33,850 --> 05:33:35,210
I had no more leaves!

7265
05:33:36,350 --> 05:33:37,870
I get four heals, brother.

7266
05:33:40,090 --> 05:33:42,250
Oh my god, my leaves were gone!

7267
05:33:42,350 --> 05:33:43,470
What do you want me to do?

7268
05:33:43,530 --> 05:33:45,250
You were taking 200 damage!

7269
05:33:45,250 --> 05:33:46,110
What do you want me to do?

7270
05:33:46,950 --> 05:33:47,430
Okay.

7271
05:33:50,670 --> 05:33:52,230
They can pull a headshot!

7272
05:33:52,610 --> 05:33:53,750
They have so much shields!

7273
05:33:55,610 --> 05:33:57,150
Alright, I'm going right side.

7274
05:33:57,250 --> 05:33:59,210
Let me know if you're going to ult.

7275
05:33:59,550 --> 05:34:00,390
I can damage boost you.

7276
05:34:01,030 --> 05:34:01,350
Alright.

7277
05:34:03,010 --> 05:34:03,490
I can damage boost you.

7278
05:34:06,570 --> 05:34:07,530
No ammo.

7279
05:34:08,730 --> 05:34:09,210
Okay.

7280
05:34:09,870 --> 05:34:11,090
I put him up.

7281
05:34:11,090 --> 05:34:12,210
I put him up.

7282
05:34:12,350 --> 05:34:13,890
Oh, Loki one, Loki one!

7283
05:34:18,530 --> 05:34:20,150
There's a door.

7284
05:34:21,890 --> 05:34:22,730
Hulk low.

7285
05:34:24,350 --> 05:34:26,570
Oh my god, that damage boosted the wrong person.

7286
05:34:30,400 --> 05:34:31,620
I can't heal him.

7287
05:34:31,800 --> 05:34:33,660
Oh my god, I had no...

7288
05:34:34,180 --> 05:34:35,260
They used ammo.

7289
05:34:36,160 --> 05:34:37,040
Hulk does!

7290
05:34:37,800 --> 05:34:38,800
No, he lives.

7291
05:34:38,800 --> 05:34:40,320
Do they have medical?

7292
05:34:41,160 --> 05:34:42,780
They should, yes, they should.

7293
05:34:43,480 --> 05:34:44,860
There it is.

7294
05:34:44,940 --> 05:34:47,060
They used poke support ult too.

7295
05:34:48,120 --> 05:34:49,260
I don't know if he lives though.

7296
05:34:51,120 --> 05:34:52,760
I'm just going back, I'm not going to use anything.

7297
05:34:54,080 --> 05:34:55,540
They used three ults here.

7298
05:35:00,360 --> 05:35:01,660
Hulk one, Hulk one!

7299
05:35:05,620 --> 05:35:07,160
I can't save him.

7300
05:35:07,160 --> 05:35:08,100
Oh my god.

7301
05:35:11,680 --> 05:35:15,280
We need to reset, but everybody is...

7302
05:35:15,280 --> 05:35:16,360
No more, please!

7303
05:35:16,460 --> 05:35:17,120
I can't!

7304
05:35:17,320 --> 05:35:18,020
No more!

7305
05:35:20,360 --> 05:35:21,560
I need heals.

7306
05:35:23,260 --> 05:35:24,460
Okay, I got Iron Man.

7307
05:35:25,540 --> 05:35:26,480
Can you heal me real quick?

7308
05:35:26,900 --> 05:35:27,200
Thank you.

7309
05:35:27,980 --> 05:35:29,660
I'm going to go in with...

7310
05:35:29,660 --> 05:35:30,220
Oh no.

7311
05:35:32,560 --> 05:35:34,000
Where do I go in, where do I go in?

7312
05:35:34,820 --> 05:35:35,900
I'm ulting on Kurt.

7313
05:35:36,380 --> 05:35:36,680
Okay.

7314
05:35:36,680 --> 05:35:36,880
We're fine.

7315
05:35:38,140 --> 05:35:40,180
Hulk on your back, Hulk on your back Punisher.

7316
05:35:40,940 --> 05:35:41,900
Hulk right behind you.

7317
05:35:42,000 --> 05:35:42,820
I stopped him.

7318
05:35:47,860 --> 05:35:48,640
We're fine.

7319
05:35:49,080 --> 05:35:49,620
I got out.

7320
05:35:52,000 --> 05:35:53,220
I'll focus on killing clones.

7321
05:35:53,440 --> 05:35:55,160
I'm dead, goodbye.

7322
05:35:58,100 --> 05:36:00,680
I don't think we can...

7323
05:36:01,240 --> 05:36:05,220
I don't think this guy is blaming the right person.

7324
05:36:05,800 --> 05:36:08,420
Yeah, I don't think he is.

7325
05:36:09,040 --> 05:36:12,820
I haven't played Loki before, but I've got a good feeling about this.

7326
05:36:13,840 --> 05:36:15,320
I don't think we can touch.

7327
05:36:19,340 --> 05:36:20,820
Our Penny might...

7328
05:36:20,820 --> 05:36:22,680
No, there's no way.

7329
05:36:22,940 --> 05:36:24,320
She's not touching that, no.

7330
05:36:26,380 --> 05:36:28,300
I might just go a second tank for defense.

7331
05:36:28,600 --> 05:36:30,000
I don't think we can run the solo Penny.

7332
05:36:31,020 --> 05:36:32,400
No, I don't think so either.

7333
05:36:36,060 --> 05:36:37,580
Mag, do you want to do Mantis?

7334
05:36:37,740 --> 05:36:39,060
Or what support do you want to play?

7335
05:36:44,060 --> 05:36:45,600
I don't know, to be honest.

7336
05:36:46,860 --> 05:36:48,120
I'll probably just say Rocket.

7337
05:36:48,640 --> 05:36:49,220
Say Rocket?

7338
05:36:49,360 --> 05:36:50,880
Okay, I'll say Mantis then.

7339
05:36:59,330 --> 05:37:02,150
Oh my god, why the fuck do we have solo Penny?

7340
05:37:03,390 --> 05:37:04,830
She has to be a one trick.

7341
05:37:05,970 --> 05:37:07,230
I feel like today...

7342
05:37:07,230 --> 05:37:07,910
Yesterday...

7343
05:37:07,910 --> 05:37:10,190
We always have these weird queues where it's like...

7344
05:37:10,190 --> 05:37:11,110
Yesterday...

7345
05:37:11,110 --> 05:37:12,790
Yesterday, we always get support.

7346
05:37:12,970 --> 05:37:14,710
Today, it's literally zero tanks.

7347
05:37:15,110 --> 05:37:16,150
It's actually crazy.

7348
05:37:20,690 --> 05:37:25,890
All the tank players have actual lives where they're actually spending Christmas with their families.

7349
05:37:26,730 --> 05:37:28,190
Yeah, they're all the wholesome guys.

7350
05:37:28,290 --> 05:37:31,590
They're all the people that actually have families to spend Christmas on.

7351
05:37:32,370 --> 05:37:32,930
DPS players and...

7352
05:37:32,930 --> 05:37:34,550
They have families because they're tanks.

7353
05:37:34,550 --> 05:37:38,410
Yeah, DPS players and supports have nobody.

7354
05:37:40,230 --> 05:37:42,550
We have more than rivals, okay?

7355
05:37:43,010 --> 05:37:43,390
We got...

7356
05:37:43,390 --> 05:37:46,050
You have your open mic, Ruben.

7357
05:37:50,370 --> 05:37:52,270
They must be like, what the fuck?

7358
05:37:53,110 --> 05:37:56,210
Dude, I'm so fucking pissed.

7359
05:37:56,550 --> 05:37:58,150
This game does that.

7360
05:37:58,230 --> 05:38:00,850
It just puts me on open mic sometimes when I tap out.

7361
05:38:04,550 --> 05:38:06,550
I have to...

7362
05:38:07,090 --> 05:38:09,710
My frames are good this round.

7363
05:38:11,190 --> 05:38:12,710
That's very reassuring.

7364
05:38:15,840 --> 05:38:17,880
That's very reassuring.

7365
05:38:18,320 --> 05:38:19,780
There is somebody behind us.

7366
05:38:22,220 --> 05:38:23,300
Okay,

7367
05:38:26,640 --> 05:38:27,060
nice.

7368
05:38:30,520 --> 05:38:31,120
Nice!

7369
05:38:31,120 --> 05:38:31,480
Nice!

7370
05:38:33,320 --> 05:38:34,200
You're fine, right?

7371
05:38:34,280 --> 05:38:34,660
Over there?

7372
05:38:38,020 --> 05:38:38,680
What's going on down here?

7373
05:38:38,680 --> 05:38:40,620
There's somebody behind here.

7374
05:38:40,760 --> 05:38:41,560
Yeah, there we go.

7375
05:38:42,700 --> 05:38:43,000
Alright.

7376
05:38:50,490 --> 05:38:52,570
Guys, I'm gonna smell on a full hold here.

7377
05:38:53,250 --> 05:38:54,030
No, don't say that.

7378
05:38:54,050 --> 05:38:55,170
Now you're gonna jinx it.

7379
05:38:55,810 --> 05:38:57,490
Now you're gonna jinx this shit.

7380
05:38:57,510 --> 05:38:58,110
No, no, no.

7381
05:38:58,210 --> 05:38:58,910
It's not possible.

7382
05:38:59,650 --> 05:39:01,530
My thing wasn't deploying?

7383
05:39:01,530 --> 05:39:03,250
Okay, it's not on a 5 second cooldown.

7384
05:39:06,350 --> 05:39:08,110
They're above on the right.

7385
05:39:08,610 --> 05:39:09,670
Psylocke on bridge.

7386
05:39:10,650 --> 05:39:11,290
What?

7387
05:39:11,970 --> 05:39:13,650
I died from that far?

7388
05:39:15,690 --> 05:39:18,050
There's a Psylocke behind us.

7389
05:39:21,760 --> 05:39:23,620
I can't kill these guys over there.

7390
05:39:24,940 --> 05:39:25,580
I have to jump.

7391
05:39:28,900 --> 05:39:30,300
Oh, their name was half.

7392
05:39:31,380 --> 05:39:32,400
Their Psylocke's low too.

7393
05:39:32,720 --> 05:39:33,500
I got you.

7394
05:39:33,940 --> 05:39:37,440
Give you

7395
05:39:40,530 --> 05:39:40,830
infinite.

7396
05:39:42,930 --> 05:39:44,190
There's a Hulk in front of us.

7397
05:39:44,230 --> 05:39:44,650
Hulk is one.

7398
05:39:45,530 --> 05:39:46,490
Hulk is on high ground.

7399
05:39:50,190 --> 05:39:51,390
Little baby banner.

7400
05:39:54,330 --> 05:39:55,310
Strange is half.

7401
05:39:55,410 --> 05:39:57,490
Okay, but he's getting healed though.

7402
05:40:01,300 --> 05:40:02,160
Strange is...

7403
05:40:02,160 --> 05:40:03,680
Oh my god, he's just getting healed.

7404
05:40:04,060 --> 05:40:05,580
Psylocke just killed our Punisher.

7405
05:40:06,140 --> 05:40:06,440
Yep.

7406
05:40:09,180 --> 05:40:10,240
This is scary.

7407
05:40:10,900 --> 05:40:12,060
Psylocke's on the height on the left.

7408
05:40:12,780 --> 05:40:13,420
Oh, hell no.

7409
05:40:14,920 --> 05:40:15,880
Did I get the Hulk?

7410
05:40:16,340 --> 05:40:16,920
No, wait.

7411
05:40:17,180 --> 05:40:17,920
I got you.

7412
05:40:18,040 --> 05:40:18,180
I got you.

7413
05:40:18,760 --> 05:40:23,080
Yeah, but we're using a lot though.

7414
05:40:23,080 --> 05:40:23,440
Haha.

7415
05:40:26,480 --> 05:40:27,180
Psylocke behind.

7416
05:40:32,560 --> 05:40:35,240
Oh, I got Psylocke ulted in the back.

7417
05:40:36,100 --> 05:40:37,500
This is great.

7418
05:40:39,320 --> 05:40:41,440
Brother, you're standing in the middle of the opening and it's four.

7419
05:40:41,520 --> 05:40:42,620
What do you mean great heals?

7420
05:40:42,960 --> 05:40:44,540
My heals are on you and you're dead.

7421
05:40:45,440 --> 05:40:45,620
Haha.

7422
05:40:47,120 --> 05:40:49,020
Oh my god, he's just dead.

7423
05:40:49,160 --> 05:40:50,900
Oh, I didn't get anyone with that.

7424
05:40:51,060 --> 05:40:55,760
Do you think I'm Jesus Christ and I can just touch you and save you from any fucking illness, brother?

7425
05:40:57,100 --> 05:40:58,480
What the fuck do you expect?

7426
05:40:58,540 --> 05:40:59,880
I'm a raccoon with a gun.

7427
05:41:00,160 --> 05:41:00,260
Haha.

7428
05:41:03,260 --> 05:41:04,960
I don't think that's...

7429
05:41:04,960 --> 05:41:06,540
I think you're not okay.

7430
05:41:07,520 --> 05:41:08,540
I think we're just...

7431
05:41:08,540 --> 05:41:09,860
Why are you wanting more by the way?

7432
05:41:10,160 --> 05:41:11,920
Are you just retarded or what?

7433
05:41:12,120 --> 05:41:14,500
Oh my god, bro.

7434
05:41:15,440 --> 05:41:15,960
Bro.

7435
05:41:18,320 --> 05:41:18,840
Bro.

7436
05:41:19,480 --> 05:41:21,320
I told you that Mickey Pooh.

7437
05:41:21,380 --> 05:41:22,780
I told you guys.

7438
05:41:23,000 --> 05:41:23,920
I told you.

7439
05:41:24,000 --> 05:41:24,800
I was like, oh my god.

7440
05:41:24,880 --> 05:41:25,320
Okay, look.

7441
05:41:25,380 --> 05:41:28,000
I need you guys to use your void slots because I don't have any left.

7442
05:41:29,960 --> 05:41:32,460
Like I really need you guys to use it.

7443
05:41:33,740 --> 05:41:34,540
I can't.

7444
05:41:34,660 --> 05:41:35,680
I don't have heals.

7445
05:41:36,180 --> 05:41:36,200
I'm trying.

7446
05:41:36,200 --> 05:41:37,200
I'm giving you so much.

7447
05:41:37,300 --> 05:41:38,120
I'm doing so much.

7448
05:41:39,300 --> 05:41:40,600
I'm trying to.

7449
05:41:41,240 --> 05:41:41,820
I'm ulting.

7450
05:41:43,560 --> 05:41:46,120
He just showed up and is about to die immediately again.

7451
05:41:47,640 --> 05:41:48,040
Okay.

7452
05:41:48,040 --> 05:41:48,160
I'm on it.

7453
05:41:48,860 --> 05:41:49,700
I'm on here.

7454
05:41:50,400 --> 05:41:53,100
I'm just hoping it hits people.

7455
05:41:53,480 --> 05:41:54,800
I dropped infinite right in front of you, Punisher.

7456
05:41:56,240 --> 05:41:58,340
He's just standing outside the infinite.

7457
05:41:59,100 --> 05:42:01,360
Oh my god.

7458
05:42:03,180 --> 05:42:03,880
My god.

7459
05:42:05,160 --> 05:42:06,420
Get 1v1, bitch.

7460
05:42:06,860 --> 05:42:08,520
Bro, he has getting healed.

7461
05:42:08,920 --> 05:42:09,680
Oh my god.

7462
05:42:10,360 --> 05:42:12,700
Okay, the Psylocke is low.

7463
05:42:12,960 --> 05:42:13,340
Nice.

7464
05:42:13,960 --> 05:42:16,120
Alright, now we gotta defend this for two minutes.

7465
05:42:16,120 --> 05:42:17,140
Whoa.

7466
05:42:19,680 --> 05:42:21,100
Oh, thank god.

7467
05:42:21,240 --> 05:42:22,380
Now he knows who to blame.

7468
05:42:22,380 --> 05:42:23,160
I'm trying.

7469
05:42:24,060 --> 05:42:25,600
Now he knows who to blame.

7470
05:42:25,660 --> 05:42:28,380
He wants him to go Psylocke into that.

7471
05:42:30,440 --> 05:42:32,680
Yeah, that's a good comp to pick Psylocke into, I think.

7472
05:42:35,440 --> 05:42:37,660
Honestly, he might be a genius.

7473
05:42:37,980 --> 05:42:39,560
Someone make this an NRG coach.

7474
05:42:39,700 --> 05:42:40,380
Fuck, bro.

7475
05:42:42,320 --> 05:42:43,540
I can't see that.

7476
05:42:43,540 --> 05:42:43,840
Oh my god.

7477
05:42:44,080 --> 05:42:45,620
This is where we die.

7478
05:42:45,620 --> 05:42:47,300
I dropped infinite for you.

7479
05:42:47,480 --> 05:42:49,120
I'm trying to heal you.

7480
05:42:50,120 --> 05:42:51,900
He destroyed the rez.

7481
05:42:52,140 --> 05:42:53,380
Mantis, help!

7482
05:42:54,080 --> 05:42:54,740
Help me!

7483
05:42:58,420 --> 05:43:01,400
No, I think...

7484
05:43:01,400 --> 05:43:02,960
Bro!

7485
05:43:04,480 --> 05:43:07,560
He's blaming everybody who's losing!

7486
05:43:09,100 --> 05:43:13,000
He's actually blaming everybody who had to fill around his dumb ass.

7487
05:43:13,020 --> 05:43:16,300
It's everybody's fault, except for us.

7488
05:43:16,700 --> 05:43:18,280
Except for him, himself.

7489
05:43:18,980 --> 05:43:21,040
That's actually crazy.

7490
05:43:27,740 --> 05:43:29,240
That's actually crazy.

7491
05:43:29,440 --> 05:43:31,360
He's blaming everybody but himself.

7492
05:43:31,540 --> 05:43:32,380
What the fuck?

7493
05:43:32,880 --> 05:43:35,060
Yeah, the dude would just like peek, fall over.

7494
05:43:35,500 --> 05:43:36,060
Don't Q.

7495
05:43:36,660 --> 05:43:37,060
Don't Q.

7496
05:43:37,060 --> 05:43:40,580
Okay, so we got the avoid Mikipoo.

7497
05:43:40,680 --> 05:43:42,120
I got avoid slots.

7498
05:43:43,120 --> 05:43:45,360
Someone got to get Mikipoo.

7499
05:43:46,800 --> 05:43:47,280
Okay.

7500
05:43:49,180 --> 05:43:50,300
Mikipoo avoided.

7501
05:43:51,240 --> 05:43:52,940
Avoid me, all of you.

7502
05:43:54,200 --> 05:43:55,360
Wait, we shouldn't!

7503
05:43:55,620 --> 05:43:59,920
Let's not avoid the Punisher, because he's going to piss him off if we get on his team again.

7504
05:43:59,960 --> 05:44:02,760
That'd be funny, but I don't mind.

7505
05:44:03,200 --> 05:44:05,500
I won't piss him off if we do get him again.

7506
05:44:06,180 --> 05:44:07,600
Yeah, you can Q now.

7507
05:44:08,040 --> 05:44:09,740
He's like, avoid me.

7508
05:44:14,420 --> 05:44:16,000
That's fucking hilarious.

7509
05:44:17,340 --> 05:44:18,420
Oh, he's on the enemy team!

7510
05:44:18,500 --> 05:44:19,700
Yo, we got to lock the fuck in.

7511
05:44:20,120 --> 05:44:22,960
Yo, we got to lock the fuck in.

7512
05:44:23,320 --> 05:44:25,980
If I'm locking in, I'm muting myself.

7513
05:44:28,120 --> 05:44:29,740
I'm deafening in chat.

7514
05:44:30,200 --> 05:44:31,460
I'm putting on a three minute delay.

7515
05:44:31,800 --> 05:44:34,940
Okay, I'm locking in, but I'm literally going to deafen myself.

7516
05:44:39,560 --> 05:44:41,760
Alright, I'm locking in chat.

7517
05:44:42,100 --> 05:44:44,780
If I'm locking in, I have to deafen myself.

7518
05:44:48,280 --> 05:44:49,840
I can't lock in.

7519
05:44:49,920 --> 05:44:52,680
I told you guys, this is why I don't stream when I'm in a stack.

7520
05:44:52,900 --> 05:44:53,980
I don't lock in.

7521
05:44:58,560 --> 05:45:02,140
I literally need to focus on here.

7522
05:45:02,140 --> 05:45:03,940
Okay, I'm banning Hawkeye.

7523
05:45:04,100 --> 05:45:05,460
I'm not playing against the Hawkeye.

7524
05:45:05,560 --> 05:45:07,120
I never want to play against the Hawkeye.

7525
05:45:08,380 --> 05:45:11,260
Okay, I actually have to focus up then.

7526
05:45:11,640 --> 05:45:14,640
I definitely play so much better when I'm not in a call with people.

7527
05:45:23,710 --> 05:45:24,230
Alright.

7528
05:45:30,470 --> 05:45:31,370
That's fine.

7529
05:45:31,370 --> 05:45:31,850
That's fine.

7530
05:45:33,410 --> 05:45:35,010
That's totally fine.

7531
05:45:35,570 --> 05:45:38,190
We have a solo Penny again, but that's okay.

7532
05:45:42,250 --> 05:45:42,790
Alright.

7533
05:45:44,130 --> 05:45:45,110
We're gonna lock in.

7534
05:45:46,290 --> 05:45:48,830
That's- today's the day we lock in, everybody.

7535
05:45:49,010 --> 05:45:50,010
Today's the day.

7536
05:45:52,390 --> 05:45:57,650
Okay, only if I'm gonna die, but I'll unmute myself just so you know, I don't fucking die.

7537
05:45:57,650 --> 05:45:57,990
Okay.

7538
05:45:59,890 --> 05:46:01,510
I'll unmute myself after.

7539
05:46:05,620 --> 05:46:07,720
If I get like, died 24-7.

7540
05:46:08,640 --> 05:46:10,340
Cause I actually hit more.

7541
05:46:13,320 --> 05:46:14,040
Uh...

7542
05:46:14,040 --> 05:46:15,640
If you don't play...

7543
05:46:15,640 --> 05:46:18,300
Oh my god.

7544
05:46:19,820 --> 05:46:21,040
Bro, that's fucking funny.

7545
05:46:26,330 --> 05:46:28,310
Dude, I just deceived him.

7546
05:46:28,810 --> 05:46:29,930
Come on, man.

7547
05:46:31,630 --> 05:46:33,170
What is this?

7548
05:46:35,510 --> 05:46:39,370
Like, they're trying to deceive us.

7549
05:46:39,370 --> 05:46:40,390
I think they're lying.

7550
05:46:46,510 --> 05:46:47,790
Okay, focus up.

7551
05:46:48,450 --> 05:46:49,550
I actually hit more shots.

7552
05:46:50,550 --> 05:46:52,730
I think cause I'm not distracting when I'm talking to people.

7553
05:46:54,230 --> 05:46:54,590
Yeah.

7554
05:46:59,630 --> 05:47:01,970
Maybe I'll put- I'm putting on the Penny.

7555
05:47:02,890 --> 05:47:04,910
She's taking much more damage than I expected.

7556
05:47:11,500 --> 05:47:11,940
Alright.

7557
05:47:13,620 --> 05:47:13,880
Nice.

7558
05:47:17,480 --> 05:47:18,160
Nice.

7559
05:47:22,410 --> 05:47:23,430
Are they on Hella?

7560
05:47:23,810 --> 05:47:24,610
Hey, they're on Hella.

7561
05:47:30,450 --> 05:47:31,410
He's one.

7562
05:47:32,250 --> 05:47:32,910
Nice.

7563
05:47:36,940 --> 05:47:37,400
Cool.

7564
05:47:37,780 --> 05:47:39,300
We're doing it, guys.

7565
05:47:39,580 --> 05:47:40,560
We're doing it.

7566
05:47:43,380 --> 05:47:44,060
Alright.

7567
05:47:44,780 --> 05:47:45,720
Guys, they lied.

7568
05:47:46,000 --> 05:47:47,680
I can't believe they also lied.

7569
05:47:47,680 --> 05:47:48,740
That's fucked up.

7570
05:47:49,440 --> 05:47:50,980
Oh my god.

7571
05:47:51,080 --> 05:47:52,540
They also lied?

7572
05:47:59,420 --> 05:48:02,360
I can't believe they would do such a thing.

7573
05:48:02,900 --> 05:48:04,520
Lying in a video game?

7574
05:48:09,640 --> 05:48:10,440
Okay.

7575
05:48:10,780 --> 05:48:11,080
What?

7576
05:48:11,820 --> 05:48:12,400
Okay.

7577
05:48:17,680 --> 05:48:18,480
What?

7578
05:48:22,200 --> 05:48:23,000
Okay.

7579
05:48:27,250 --> 05:48:28,050
Alright.

7580
05:48:32,620 --> 05:48:33,420
Okay.

7581
05:48:34,000 --> 05:48:35,540
What is this team?

7582
05:48:48,280 --> 05:48:48,680
Alright.

7583
05:48:51,140 --> 05:48:51,940
Alright.

7584
05:48:53,520 --> 05:48:55,060
Okay, guys.

7585
05:48:55,440 --> 05:48:59,020
Guys, you can still die from this, although...

7586
05:48:59,020 --> 05:49:02,060
Guys, okay, I don't think he realized you can still die from this.

7587
05:49:10,560 --> 05:49:11,340
Oh my god.

7588
05:49:11,380 --> 05:49:11,680
Please.

7589
05:49:11,760 --> 05:49:12,620
He's so low.

7590
05:49:13,060 --> 05:49:13,880
Oh, nice.

7591
05:49:13,980 --> 05:49:14,800
I distracted him.

7592
05:49:14,840 --> 05:49:15,400
Let's go.

7593
05:49:15,960 --> 05:49:16,880
Let's go.

7594
05:49:17,240 --> 05:49:18,620
I told you, guys.

7595
05:49:18,960 --> 05:49:20,320
The moment I'm deafened.

7596
05:49:21,360 --> 05:49:22,320
I don't know why.

7597
05:49:22,420 --> 05:49:24,140
Talking to you guys, I'm more focused.

7598
05:49:27,380 --> 05:49:29,400
Legitimately, I can aim better.

7599
05:49:29,540 --> 05:49:31,060
I can freeze everything.

7600
05:49:31,240 --> 05:49:33,640
Talking to you guys, I'm playing better.

7601
05:49:33,640 --> 05:49:36,780
Like, I should be more distracted.

7602
05:49:37,380 --> 05:49:39,650
I'm looking at chat, but for some reason...

7603
05:49:41,260 --> 05:49:42,880
Like, here, it's just different.

7604
05:49:45,080 --> 05:49:46,180
It's just different.

7605
05:49:46,280 --> 05:49:46,980
I just play different.

7606
05:49:47,520 --> 05:49:50,260
That is not great.

7607
05:49:51,580 --> 05:49:53,080
I'm fucking cheating.

7608
05:49:57,780 --> 05:49:59,160
Like, look at that.

7609
05:49:59,980 --> 05:50:01,080
Holy shit.

7610
05:50:02,000 --> 05:50:04,120
That looked like I was walling.

7611
05:50:04,420 --> 05:50:06,000
That prediction there.

7612
05:50:09,280 --> 05:50:11,000
Alright, let's lock in now.

7613
05:50:11,640 --> 05:50:13,120
Let's actually focus up.

7614
05:50:14,520 --> 05:50:17,140
Okay, there was no saving him at all.

7615
05:50:19,240 --> 05:50:19,800
What?

7616
05:50:21,880 --> 05:50:23,160
Oh my god.

7617
05:50:23,540 --> 05:50:26,020
I need to look at where my cloak was.

7618
05:50:26,160 --> 05:50:27,280
Where the fuck were you looking at?

7619
05:50:27,680 --> 05:50:27,760
Where?

7620
05:50:28,020 --> 05:50:28,380
Ha!

7621
05:50:28,500 --> 05:50:28,940
Okay.

7622
05:50:28,940 --> 05:50:30,400
Alright.

7623
05:50:30,900 --> 05:50:32,660
We gotta regroup.

7624
05:50:34,940 --> 05:50:35,660
Okay.

7625
05:50:38,760 --> 05:50:40,940
I hope, like...

7626
05:50:42,020 --> 05:50:42,860
Oh my god.

7627
05:50:42,960 --> 05:50:43,680
I need...

7628
05:50:43,680 --> 05:50:48,000
Please, I can't see you.

7629
05:50:50,920 --> 05:50:51,620
Okay.

7630
05:50:57,380 --> 05:50:57,720
Okay.

7631
05:50:59,040 --> 05:51:01,160
Oh, that's alright.

7632
05:51:01,620 --> 05:51:03,140
He was not gonna live anyway.

7633
05:51:03,380 --> 05:51:05,480
Look at that damage.

7634
05:51:05,720 --> 05:51:07,120
I don't think he was gonna live.

7635
05:51:08,080 --> 05:51:09,740
Look at that damage.

7636
05:51:13,220 --> 05:51:14,320
Oh, Ruben.

7637
05:51:14,780 --> 05:51:16,220
You take so much damage.

7638
05:51:16,400 --> 05:51:17,360
It scares me.

7639
05:51:19,960 --> 05:51:21,240
Oh, Ruben.

7640
05:51:22,580 --> 05:51:24,700
You take so much damage.

7641
05:51:25,060 --> 05:51:27,820
It's scaring the shit out of me right now.

7642
05:51:31,930 --> 05:51:33,390
Oh my god, please.

7643
05:51:36,010 --> 05:51:36,470
Please.

7644
05:51:39,510 --> 05:51:42,250
Oh, I'm putting on a show.

7645
05:51:43,850 --> 05:51:45,450
They have Groot ult.

7646
05:51:48,610 --> 05:51:51,170
I know they're gonna Groot ult this.

7647
05:51:53,550 --> 05:51:55,410
They're gonna Groot ult.

7648
05:51:57,510 --> 05:51:59,450
They have Groot ult.

7649
05:51:59,450 --> 05:52:01,450
Right here.

7650
05:52:05,070 --> 05:52:05,490
No!

7651
05:52:12,750 --> 05:52:13,170
No!

7652
05:52:15,730 --> 05:52:16,570
No!

7653
05:52:21,890 --> 05:52:23,730
Okay, that's fine.

7654
05:52:24,850 --> 05:52:25,570
That's fine.

7655
05:52:26,690 --> 05:52:28,290
We have three up.

7656
05:52:28,450 --> 05:52:29,110
We're three up.

7657
05:52:29,170 --> 05:52:29,770
That's fine.

7658
05:52:30,610 --> 05:52:31,990
Oh, we're so healthy.

7659
05:52:34,490 --> 05:52:35,930
Oh my god.

7660
05:52:35,930 --> 05:52:39,410
Oh my god.

7661
05:52:39,890 --> 05:52:40,070
Oh my god.

7662
05:52:40,070 --> 05:52:40,530
That's fine.

7663
05:52:41,710 --> 05:52:42,790
That's fine.

7664
05:52:44,410 --> 05:52:46,050
Travis, I have to go now.

7665
05:52:46,270 --> 05:52:47,730
Have a good rest.

7666
05:52:48,310 --> 05:52:48,630
Wait.

7667
05:52:49,010 --> 05:52:50,950
Wait, Viva is 4-6?

7668
05:52:52,470 --> 05:52:55,030
Guys, Viva is 4-6.

7669
05:52:56,210 --> 05:52:57,290
Let's go!

7670
05:52:59,510 --> 05:53:01,850
He has four kills on Hela.

7671
05:53:02,670 --> 05:53:03,990
Let's let you go.

7672
05:53:03,990 --> 05:53:05,810
Let's let you go.

7673
05:53:06,030 --> 05:53:07,510
Alright, back to deafened mode.

7674
05:53:07,670 --> 05:53:08,990
Good luck, everybody.

7675
05:53:10,810 --> 05:53:14,690
I actually, not gonna lie, if I was deafened, I think we would actually climb.

7676
05:53:16,090 --> 05:53:17,510
No, dude!

7677
05:53:18,230 --> 05:53:21,450
I'm hitting like every fucking shot and I freeze.

7678
05:53:21,730 --> 05:53:22,710
I don't know.

7679
05:53:23,510 --> 05:53:28,970
I will say, when you deafened, I just started hitting the biggest range ults ever seen by man.

7680
05:53:28,990 --> 05:53:30,850
Yeah, I think we're all just locked in.

7681
05:53:31,490 --> 05:53:36,050
But dude, it's either that or the fact that we really, really wanna beat Viva.

7682
05:53:36,230 --> 05:53:38,710
I think we all sat down to beat him.

7683
05:53:38,830 --> 05:53:42,610
Yeah, we all just really wanna... He's the only one negative on their team.

7684
05:53:42,850 --> 05:53:43,930
Oh my god.

7685
05:53:44,650 --> 05:53:47,130
Alright, I'm locking in.

7686
05:53:47,810 --> 05:53:48,990
Alright, he locked back in.

7687
05:53:49,370 --> 05:53:50,590
Alright, here we go.

7688
05:53:53,090 --> 05:53:54,670
Travis humiliate Viva.

7689
05:53:56,150 --> 05:53:56,590
Hey.

7690
05:53:56,590 --> 05:53:57,230
Hey.

7691
05:54:02,660 --> 05:54:03,440
I'll put it on Penny.

7692
05:54:03,560 --> 05:54:05,020
I feel like Penny is...

7693
05:54:05,680 --> 05:54:08,060
For some reason, Penny looks like a feeder.

7694
05:54:12,110 --> 05:54:14,770
For some fucking reason, I can tell Penny...

7695
05:54:16,350 --> 05:54:18,410
Penny looks like the feeder of the team.

7696
05:54:20,210 --> 05:54:22,110
For some fucking reason...

7697
05:54:22,770 --> 05:54:24,110
I fucking...

7698
05:54:24,110 --> 05:54:25,490
I just knew it.

7699
05:54:26,190 --> 05:54:26,670
Oh.

7700
05:54:32,810 --> 05:54:34,590
I fucking called it, guys.

7701
05:54:35,230 --> 05:54:38,350
I fucking called it.

7702
05:54:38,630 --> 05:54:40,310
Wait, did our Penny DC there?

7703
05:54:40,430 --> 05:54:41,450
What the fuck was that?

7704
05:54:43,690 --> 05:54:44,750
What was that?

7705
05:54:52,220 --> 05:54:53,320
Oh my god.

7706
05:54:56,640 --> 05:54:58,700
I hope I see the Penny walking back.

7707
05:54:58,800 --> 05:54:59,620
Oh, he does.

7708
05:54:59,720 --> 05:55:00,700
Okay, I was gonna say.

7709
05:55:04,230 --> 05:55:04,830
Okay.

7710
05:55:06,750 --> 05:55:08,070
Oh my god, guys.

7711
05:55:08,170 --> 05:55:08,770
The whole thing, guys.

7712
05:55:11,030 --> 05:55:12,410
I knew Penny was...

7713
05:55:12,410 --> 05:55:16,790
I can tell playing support has let me realize who's a feeder.

7714
05:55:24,870 --> 05:55:26,370
I can tell.

7715
05:55:27,310 --> 05:55:28,530
I can read.

7716
05:55:28,970 --> 05:55:31,130
I can read the feeder minds.

7717
05:55:38,360 --> 05:55:38,840
Alright.

7718
05:55:40,180 --> 05:55:41,620
Alright, I'm fucking gonna hide.

7719
05:55:41,760 --> 05:55:42,320
Guys, please.

7720
05:55:42,980 --> 05:55:44,900
Guys, you don't outlive this.

7721
05:55:45,240 --> 05:55:47,320
You don't outlive this, guys.

7722
05:55:47,540 --> 05:55:49,500
You don't outlive the damage.

7723
05:55:50,580 --> 05:55:51,300
Okay, nice.

7724
05:55:56,550 --> 05:55:57,390
That's fine.

7725
05:56:00,890 --> 05:56:01,830
That's fine.

7726
05:56:06,890 --> 05:56:07,910
That's fine.

7727
05:56:07,910 --> 05:56:08,210
That's fine.

7728
05:56:10,790 --> 05:56:12,810
Everything is fine.

7729
05:56:17,990 --> 05:56:19,730
Everything is fine.

7730
05:56:23,670 --> 05:56:26,110
Oh my god, it's all good.

7731
05:56:26,670 --> 05:56:28,450
How did he still play Hella?

7732
05:56:29,650 --> 05:56:31,790
He's still letting him play Hella.

7733
05:56:32,470 --> 05:56:33,550
Holy fuck.

7734
05:56:33,550 --> 05:56:41,930
LOL That's actually crazy that they're still giving him Hella.

7735
05:56:42,470 --> 05:56:45,770
That's actually insane.

7736
05:56:51,420 --> 05:56:53,570
He should never be on Hella duty.

7737
05:57:04,980 --> 05:57:06,040
Goodbye.

7738
05:57:08,940 --> 05:57:10,320
Yes, sir.

7739
05:57:12,620 --> 05:57:13,440
Oh no.

7740
05:57:13,800 --> 05:57:14,760
Oh no.

7741
05:57:16,300 --> 05:57:17,480
It's fine, I have ult.

7742
05:57:19,060 --> 05:57:19,720
I have ult.

7743
05:57:22,340 --> 05:57:23,100
Guys.

7744
05:57:24,660 --> 05:57:26,760
Please, I don't want to peek.

7745
05:57:29,740 --> 05:57:31,580
Alright, nice.

7746
05:57:35,440 --> 05:57:36,800
Let's go, Penny.

7747
05:57:37,000 --> 05:57:38,060
Let's go.

7748
05:57:38,600 --> 05:57:40,840
Let's fucking go, Penny.

7749
05:57:46,180 --> 05:57:47,560
Wait, he lives?

7750
05:57:49,700 --> 05:57:54,920
Oh, this is bad.

7751
05:57:58,740 --> 05:58:00,180
Like, I don't know where to look yet.

7752
05:58:04,200 --> 05:58:04,820
Nice.

7753
05:58:09,060 --> 05:58:09,960
Let's go.

7754
05:58:09,960 --> 05:58:09,980
Let's go.

7755
05:58:13,880 --> 05:58:15,700
Oh my god.

7756
05:58:17,600 --> 05:58:19,420
Oh my god.

7757
05:58:19,700 --> 05:58:20,880
I fucking did it.

7758
05:58:21,100 --> 05:58:22,740
It wasn't even close.

7759
05:58:23,140 --> 05:58:25,120
That was so free.

7760
05:58:25,400 --> 05:58:26,520
Holy shit.

7761
05:58:27,660 --> 05:58:28,960
Oh my god.

7762
05:58:29,580 --> 05:58:31,920
Despite both ways.

7763
05:58:33,080 --> 05:58:36,240
Bro, I locked in so hard.

7764
05:58:37,580 --> 05:58:39,880
This first grandmastering, bro.

7765
05:58:40,020 --> 05:58:41,460
That poor guy.

7766
05:58:42,240 --> 05:58:47,120
Bro, you must be so mad.

7767
05:58:47,860 --> 05:58:49,640
I hope you lose it.

7768
05:58:50,460 --> 05:58:52,740
Bro, I hope you lose it.

7769
05:58:52,800 --> 05:58:54,500
You don't deserve it.

7770
05:58:54,920 --> 05:58:57,820
Oh my god, he's flaming the support player.

7771
05:58:59,320 --> 05:59:02,460
Less damage and the loudest.

7772
05:59:02,740 --> 05:59:03,980
Oh my god.

7773
05:59:06,240 --> 05:59:06,960
Damn.

7774
05:59:08,560 --> 05:59:10,580
Oh my god.

7775
05:59:12,540 --> 05:59:14,180
Just like...

7776
05:59:16,400 --> 05:59:18,040
No heals.

7777
05:59:18,180 --> 05:59:19,360
Holy fuck.

7778
05:59:19,820 --> 05:59:22,120
He's actually the worst kind of DPS.

7779
05:59:26,840 --> 05:59:28,480
Mama Haktur.

7780
05:59:29,300 --> 05:59:30,240
Oh my god.

7781
05:59:30,700 --> 05:59:31,340
He's that good.

7782
05:59:32,060 --> 05:59:33,360
We got Mama Haktur.

7783
05:59:33,500 --> 05:59:34,380
There's no way we lose.

7784
05:59:34,380 --> 05:59:36,360
We're gonna dive in mines with him.

7785
05:59:36,520 --> 05:59:37,180
He goes.

7786
05:59:39,780 --> 05:59:42,160
Oh, I can play Mantis.

7787
05:59:45,300 --> 05:59:47,820
We at least have two supports.

7788
05:59:48,440 --> 05:59:49,640
You know, it's the little things.

7789
05:59:51,660 --> 05:59:54,260
Are you banning Hawkeye or Bruce first?

7790
05:59:54,740 --> 05:59:55,300
Hawkeye.

7791
05:59:56,120 --> 05:59:59,880
Hawkeye and then Bruce because it guarantees the Hawkeye ban.

7792
06:00:01,880 --> 06:00:05,500
And then we ban Bruce because fuck Hawke now.

7793
06:00:06,960 --> 06:00:10,860
We have a really good Hella player, so I'm not too...

7794
06:00:10,860 --> 06:00:14,120
Not too, like, worried about it.

7795
06:00:18,860 --> 06:00:20,420
Oh, they got Hella.

7796
06:00:20,680 --> 06:00:21,840
We got Hella.

7797
06:00:22,480 --> 06:00:23,380
We definitely do.

7798
06:00:27,060 --> 06:00:32,860
It's not like three of us are streaming and I'm pretty sure they can look up our streams.

7799
06:00:34,140 --> 06:00:35,100
Yeah.

7800
06:00:35,980 --> 06:00:36,940
Oh,

7801
06:00:41,930 --> 06:00:43,270
he went Widow.

7802
06:00:47,410 --> 06:00:48,870
Why hull carry?

7803
06:00:49,330 --> 06:00:50,470
It's broken.

7804
06:00:51,630 --> 06:00:53,230
Oh, Luna.

7805
06:00:55,310 --> 06:00:58,050
I guess Luna Loki could work.

7806
06:01:00,370 --> 06:01:01,050
Uh...

7807
06:01:01,050 --> 06:01:04,490
I can do...

7808
06:01:04,490 --> 06:01:05,290
Do Loki.

7809
06:01:07,670 --> 06:01:09,630
I feel like Loki would work in this comp.

7810
06:01:16,440 --> 06:01:17,120
Okay,

7811
06:01:21,680 --> 06:01:22,660
Loki or Cloak?

7812
06:01:23,200 --> 06:01:24,480
I think you should.

7813
06:01:25,020 --> 06:01:26,120
This is really good.

7814
06:01:26,220 --> 06:01:27,840
We need a double tank for this.

7815
06:01:32,540 --> 06:01:32,940
Hmm...

7816
06:01:32,940 --> 06:01:34,560
I'll go Cloak, actually, for the heals.

7817
06:01:37,200 --> 06:01:40,840
Would you guys prefer I Magneto and then I bubble you whenever you go in?

7818
06:01:41,620 --> 06:01:43,900
Oh, yeah, you can bubble me when I ult.

7819
06:01:44,580 --> 06:01:44,800
Alright.

7820
06:01:49,380 --> 06:01:49,780
Oh...

7821
06:01:49,780 --> 06:01:52,140
Just cause, like, I feel like we might need the extra heals.

7822
06:01:52,940 --> 06:01:54,940
Loki might be good for offensive, not defensive.

7823
06:01:59,600 --> 06:02:01,960
Honestly, dude, filling is kind of fun.

7824
06:02:02,680 --> 06:02:03,680
No, it's not.

7825
06:02:04,100 --> 06:02:06,060
I don't mind it that much.

7826
06:02:07,080 --> 06:02:07,860
Penny over there.

7827
06:02:17,290 --> 06:02:19,070
I can't heal you over there.

7828
06:02:19,470 --> 06:02:20,490
We also lost one.

7829
06:02:20,770 --> 06:02:21,630
Oh my god.

7830
06:02:21,810 --> 06:02:22,230
Oh, wait.

7831
06:02:22,470 --> 06:02:23,590
Oh, they DC'd.

7832
06:02:24,010 --> 06:02:26,430
Oh, and then he reconnects?

7833
06:02:26,510 --> 06:02:26,830
Really?

7834
06:02:27,850 --> 06:02:29,190
Oh my god.

7835
06:02:29,930 --> 06:02:30,730
Yo, yo!

7836
06:02:30,750 --> 06:02:31,770
Oh my god, I'm stuck.

7837
06:02:32,230 --> 06:02:33,530
Why did he type?

7838
06:02:33,670 --> 06:02:34,510
He was typing!

7839
06:02:35,610 --> 06:02:37,090
That's actually crazy.

7840
06:02:38,650 --> 06:02:40,150
He, like, typed to apologize.

7841
06:02:43,110 --> 06:02:43,890
That's unlucky.

7842
06:02:44,070 --> 06:02:45,290
We literally lost that because of...

7843
06:02:47,450 --> 06:02:47,850
Uh...

7844
06:02:48,530 --> 06:02:48,930
Hmm...

7845
06:02:48,930 --> 06:02:50,810
This is just really unfortunate.

7846
06:02:50,970 --> 06:02:53,290
Me and the Salak have just been having a 1v1 for like 10 minutes.

7847
06:02:57,440 --> 06:02:58,760
I'm trying to keep you guys up.

7848
06:03:03,850 --> 06:03:05,490
I'm slowly rotating to the other side.

7849
06:03:10,050 --> 06:03:11,370
They're so low.

7850
06:03:11,870 --> 06:03:12,710
Yeah, they're all just...

7851
06:03:13,270 --> 06:03:17,130
Shut up, Raccoon and Groot.

7852
06:03:18,650 --> 06:03:19,430
Penny dies.

7853
06:03:19,790 --> 06:03:20,010
Okay.

7854
06:03:20,370 --> 06:03:20,910
Maybe not.

7855
06:03:22,310 --> 06:03:22,590
She dies.

7856
06:03:22,750 --> 06:03:25,490
I think...

7857
06:03:25,490 --> 06:03:26,090
I don't know.

7858
06:03:26,310 --> 06:03:27,230
No, they got rez.

7859
06:03:27,410 --> 06:03:28,150
They have rez here.

7860
06:03:28,710 --> 06:03:30,250
I can aggressively ult this.

7861
06:03:31,150 --> 06:03:31,670
Okay.

7862
06:03:34,710 --> 06:03:35,490
I'm on my way.

7863
06:03:35,590 --> 06:03:36,770
I have no DPS up right now.

7864
06:03:37,370 --> 06:03:38,390
Um, we're down.

7865
06:03:38,570 --> 06:03:39,830
We're down too.

7866
06:03:40,030 --> 06:03:40,930
I don't know.

7867
06:03:42,070 --> 06:03:42,770
I'm coming.

7868
06:03:46,550 --> 06:03:47,450
Our Luna died.

7869
06:03:48,010 --> 06:03:48,290
Yeah.

7870
06:03:50,270 --> 06:03:51,530
I forced Luna ult.

7871
06:03:51,570 --> 06:03:52,330
That's actually huge.

7872
06:03:52,610 --> 06:03:53,070
Yeah, yeah.

7873
06:03:53,350 --> 06:03:54,590
But we don't have spoilers.

7874
06:03:54,790 --> 06:03:56,430
They still... Did they use rocket ult?

7875
06:03:57,510 --> 06:03:58,550
They did use rocket ult, yeah.

7876
06:03:58,550 --> 06:03:59,650
Okay, so we both...

7877
06:04:00,430 --> 06:04:01,410
I'm not sure, actually.

7878
06:04:01,530 --> 06:04:01,830
I lied.

7879
06:04:02,110 --> 06:04:03,210
I don't know if they used it.

7880
06:04:03,530 --> 06:04:05,890
I know that...

7881
06:04:05,890 --> 06:04:07,810
Wait, they did use rocket ult.

7882
06:04:08,010 --> 06:04:08,310
Oh, yeah.

7883
06:04:08,390 --> 06:04:08,750
That's fine.

7884
06:04:17,040 --> 06:04:18,380
I'm getting rid of the mines.

7885
06:04:19,320 --> 06:04:19,620
I'm dead.

7886
06:04:20,700 --> 06:04:23,000
I can try and...

7887
06:04:23,000 --> 06:04:23,560
kill you.

7888
06:04:23,660 --> 06:04:28,300
I can't heal you.

7889
06:04:28,380 --> 06:04:28,760
I can't heal...

7890
06:04:29,320 --> 06:04:31,320
Yeah, they rez too.

7891
06:04:37,610 --> 06:04:38,050
Oh!

7892
06:04:40,310 --> 06:04:41,330
I can't do anything.

7893
06:04:42,750 --> 06:04:44,210
I literally can't do anything.

7894
06:04:45,570 --> 06:04:46,230
I killed Psylocke.

7895
06:04:47,290 --> 06:04:48,930
They walled us off.

7896
06:04:49,970 --> 06:04:50,410
Damn.

7897
06:04:51,290 --> 06:04:52,210
I have ult here.

7898
06:04:52,470 --> 06:04:53,610
You have to play on my ult, though.

7899
06:04:54,050 --> 06:04:54,530
I'm done.

7900
06:04:59,800 --> 06:05:02,120
The only thing I can do is just try and keep you alive.

7901
06:05:03,160 --> 06:05:04,920
I come back with the Megiddo ult.

7902
06:05:04,920 --> 06:05:06,940
Groot's gonna have his ult in like one second.

7903
06:05:06,940 --> 06:05:07,600
I can't do anything.

7904
06:05:08,140 --> 06:05:10,160
I am...

7905
06:05:10,160 --> 06:05:11,980
Our Groot is gonna die too.

7906
06:05:12,220 --> 06:05:12,780
Our Groot's dead.

7907
06:05:14,680 --> 06:05:15,920
You have no supports.

7908
06:05:16,140 --> 06:05:19,280
I don't know if I should...

7909
06:05:19,280 --> 06:05:20,220
Should I play rocket?

7910
06:05:21,380 --> 06:05:22,920
I feel like a defensive ult.

7911
06:05:23,480 --> 06:05:23,600
I think I...

7912
06:05:23,600 --> 06:05:26,120
I think I ult on Megiddo and swap off.

7913
06:05:26,260 --> 06:05:27,580
I'm doing fucking nothing.

7914
06:05:29,980 --> 06:05:30,740
Yeah, alright.

7915
06:05:31,400 --> 06:05:31,880
Alright.

7916
06:05:35,080 --> 06:05:38,880
Yeah, our Widow got hella staggered.

7917
06:05:43,480 --> 06:05:44,620
There's three on it.

7918
06:05:46,660 --> 06:05:47,840
Yeah, I can't do anything.

7919
06:05:48,560 --> 06:05:49,840
I can't heal you there.

7920
06:05:50,780 --> 06:05:51,480
I'm coming out.

7921
06:05:52,160 --> 06:05:52,700
Okay.

7922
06:05:53,060 --> 06:05:54,780
We're giving them so much free space.

7923
06:05:55,480 --> 06:05:56,820
They're hard pushing us.

7924
06:05:57,020 --> 06:05:57,500
Okay.

7925
06:05:57,780 --> 06:06:00,400
I got...

7926
06:06:01,100 --> 06:06:03,120
We have to help Ruben with the Bourbons.

7927
06:06:03,460 --> 06:06:03,480
Yeah.

7928
06:06:03,480 --> 06:06:03,860
We got nothing.

7929
06:06:07,660 --> 06:06:08,140
Nice.

7930
06:06:08,340 --> 06:06:08,720
That's huge.

7931
06:06:09,520 --> 06:06:10,740
We have to push up.

7932
06:06:12,660 --> 06:06:15,820
We have to help our...

7933
06:06:15,820 --> 06:06:16,220
Nice.

7934
06:06:18,900 --> 06:06:19,520
He's low.

7935
06:06:19,580 --> 06:06:19,900
They're low.

7936
06:06:22,180 --> 06:06:22,800
They're low.

7937
06:06:22,920 --> 06:06:23,480
They're so low.

7938
06:06:23,720 --> 06:06:24,300
Oh my god.

7939
06:06:24,340 --> 06:06:25,180
They're so fucking...

7940
06:06:25,180 --> 06:06:25,980
They're all so low.

7941
06:06:26,380 --> 06:06:27,360
Back up, I think.

7942
06:06:27,860 --> 06:06:28,620
We should back up.

7943
06:06:29,440 --> 06:06:29,920
Man.

7944
06:06:31,260 --> 06:06:32,320
There's a Penny to my left.

7945
06:06:33,740 --> 06:06:34,500
Penny's hot.

7946
06:06:35,540 --> 06:06:35,920
I can't.

7947
06:06:35,980 --> 06:06:36,300
I'm ulting.

7948
06:06:36,860 --> 06:06:37,180
I'm sent.

7949
06:06:41,200 --> 06:06:42,000
I'm done.

7950
06:06:42,320 --> 06:06:44,140
I just got no more head units from so far.

7951
06:06:48,020 --> 06:06:49,660
I only have solo ulting.

7952
06:06:50,380 --> 06:06:51,640
I mean, I'm the only solo healer.

7953
06:06:52,380 --> 06:06:52,860
Be careful.

7954
06:06:55,240 --> 06:06:56,260
We're both back.

7955
06:06:56,260 --> 06:06:58,200
But we're giving them so much free space.

7956
06:07:03,160 --> 06:07:04,440
Never mind.

7957
06:07:04,560 --> 06:07:07,360
Never mind.

7958
06:07:07,460 --> 06:07:08,120
They have rez.

7959
06:07:09,940 --> 06:07:12,160
Our Groot is having trouble.

7960
06:07:16,110 --> 06:07:17,910
They have so much free space.

7961
06:07:18,010 --> 06:07:18,770
That's the only issue.

7962
06:07:20,090 --> 06:07:20,470
Yeah.

7963
06:07:23,290 --> 06:07:24,790
They're just freely pushing.

7964
06:07:24,790 --> 06:07:25,830
Oh, there's a Psylocke there.

7965
06:07:26,090 --> 06:07:27,130
Yeah, I saw.

7966
06:07:29,690 --> 06:07:31,210
They're all... their Luna's one.

7967
06:07:36,310 --> 06:07:37,790
We're coming back.

7968
06:07:38,630 --> 06:07:40,330
We don't have Luna ult anymore though.

7969
06:07:40,530 --> 06:07:41,030
Psylocke behind.

7970
06:07:41,230 --> 06:07:41,510
On my right.

7971
06:07:42,330 --> 06:07:44,290
I'm coming back.

7972
06:07:45,690 --> 06:07:46,650
Psylocke looking for me.

7973
06:07:48,590 --> 06:07:49,670
I'm coming back.

7974
06:07:51,690 --> 06:07:52,210
Wow.

7975
06:07:53,090 --> 06:07:54,010
Oh, that's huge.

7976
06:07:54,090 --> 06:07:54,290
That's huge.

7977
06:07:55,670 --> 06:07:57,030
That's actually...

7978
06:07:57,030 --> 06:07:57,670
Oh my god.

7979
06:07:57,770 --> 06:07:58,590
That's fine.

7980
06:07:59,130 --> 06:07:59,390
That's fine.

7981
06:08:01,470 --> 06:08:03,390
Help our Groot if we can.

7982
06:08:04,030 --> 06:08:05,770
I'm coming back fast.

7983
06:08:10,710 --> 06:08:11,510
Nice.

7984
06:08:18,750 --> 06:08:21,450
They have two fights here.

7985
06:08:26,650 --> 06:08:28,250
I'm one.

7986
06:08:29,050 --> 06:08:30,650
We're trying to heal you right now.

7987
06:08:30,650 --> 06:08:32,510
I'm trying to get all ults here.

7988
06:08:32,750 --> 06:08:33,710
I have all here.

7989
06:08:41,690 --> 06:08:42,930
Oh my god.

7990
06:08:43,010 --> 06:08:43,870
Groot, please.

7991
06:08:44,530 --> 06:08:48,030
I got ulted by Groot.

7992
06:08:51,090 --> 06:08:51,870
You should live this.

7993
06:08:52,690 --> 06:08:54,110
Oh, we used double support also.

7994
06:08:55,510 --> 06:08:56,150
Killed Psylocke.

7995
06:08:56,810 --> 06:08:57,290
Nice.

7996
06:08:57,290 --> 06:08:58,670
I'm flexing Penny.

7997
06:09:04,400 --> 06:09:05,640
Psylocke has ult.

7998
06:09:07,480 --> 06:09:08,480
Groot dies.

7999
06:09:09,480 --> 06:09:10,520
Raccoon dies.

8000
06:09:10,620 --> 06:09:11,100
Raccoon's one.

8001
06:09:12,520 --> 06:09:13,320
Oh my god.

8002
06:09:16,340 --> 06:09:18,680
They have one full fight.

8003
06:09:18,820 --> 06:09:19,560
They have one full fight.

8004
06:09:20,900 --> 06:09:21,420
Alright.

8005
06:09:22,240 --> 06:09:23,400
They have Psylocke ult too.

8006
06:09:23,940 --> 06:09:25,060
I don't think we should stay close.

8007
06:09:25,140 --> 06:09:26,040
We have no support ults.

8008
06:09:27,360 --> 06:09:29,100
I'm trying to get out.

8009
06:09:32,420 --> 06:09:33,400
Psylocke's on my right.

8010
06:09:33,980 --> 06:09:36,620
Yeah, our Psylocke is waiting for us.

8011
06:09:37,500 --> 06:09:38,020
Penny!

8012
06:09:39,940 --> 06:09:40,640
That's fine.

8013
06:09:44,480 --> 06:09:45,300
Psylocke on the right.

8014
06:09:45,480 --> 06:09:45,960
I have assemble.

8015
06:09:47,580 --> 06:09:48,140
Assemble!

8016
06:09:48,140 --> 06:09:48,240
Assemble!

8017
06:09:54,600 --> 06:09:56,500
Oh my god, I just got blown up.

8018
06:09:57,140 --> 06:09:59,220
He's looking for ult to Psylocke.

8019
06:10:00,760 --> 06:10:02,140
Oh, I think...

8020
06:10:04,120 --> 06:10:05,520
I'm just going to die on Karthus.

8021
06:10:09,180 --> 06:10:10,380
Do we have one more touch?

8022
06:10:10,880 --> 06:10:12,180
I don't think so.

8023
06:10:13,220 --> 06:10:16,920
Yeah, that was literally the last fight.

8024
06:10:18,080 --> 06:10:20,040
We just couldn't build support ults in time.

8025
06:10:20,200 --> 06:10:21,540
Because we double support ulted.

8026
06:10:22,060 --> 06:10:23,060
That's fucked.

8027
06:10:25,000 --> 06:10:26,880
They did cap an OT though, so we got time.

8028
06:10:27,100 --> 06:10:27,440
Yeah.

8029
06:10:33,160 --> 06:10:35,180
I just feel like...

8030
06:10:35,180 --> 06:10:36,740
I think I have to go Cloak.

8031
06:10:36,880 --> 06:10:38,840
Just because of the heal output.

8032
06:10:42,680 --> 06:10:43,560
Jesus Christ.

8033
06:10:43,640 --> 06:10:45,760
These games are so sweaty now, chat!

8034
06:10:46,580 --> 06:10:48,720
These games are so sweaty!

8035
06:10:51,520 --> 06:10:52,820
Oh my god.

8036
06:10:55,000 --> 06:10:56,300
Oh my god.

8037
06:10:57,560 --> 06:10:58,380
These times.

8038
06:10:58,820 --> 06:10:59,900
They're so sweaty.

8039
06:11:00,460 --> 06:11:03,080
When do the games get so fucking difficult?

8040
06:11:03,400 --> 06:11:04,880
I'm going to kick some plants.

8041
06:11:05,520 --> 06:11:07,620
Kick some fucking plants.

8042
06:11:10,460 --> 06:11:12,460
GM2 was such a nice place to be.

8043
06:11:12,580 --> 06:11:14,620
And now I'm back here in the fucking dungeons.

8044
06:11:15,760 --> 06:11:15,940
What?

8045
06:11:21,960 --> 06:11:22,580
Goddamnit!

8046
06:11:23,760 --> 06:11:24,380
Because...

8047
06:11:24,380 --> 06:11:26,760
All these players...

8048
06:11:26,760 --> 06:11:28,000
They're so over Christmas.

8049
06:11:28,480 --> 06:11:29,900
They're all just...

8050
06:11:29,900 --> 06:11:31,540
Nothing else in their lives, just like me.

8051
06:11:31,760 --> 06:11:33,000
Playing Barbaral Rivals.

8052
06:11:33,360 --> 06:11:34,860
But I just have a problem.

8053
06:11:41,680 --> 06:11:43,560
I just have issues.

8054
06:11:43,560 --> 06:11:45,120
With mines.

8055
06:11:48,540 --> 06:11:49,220
Careful!

8056
06:11:51,240 --> 06:11:53,440
It's fine, he's a tree.

8057
06:11:55,400 --> 06:11:56,660
Trees are weak to fire.

8058
06:11:57,080 --> 06:11:59,020
Trees are immune to fire now.

8059
06:11:59,280 --> 06:12:00,040
No, they're okay.

8060
06:12:00,440 --> 06:12:01,200
It's fine.

8061
06:12:05,380 --> 06:12:06,700
There's a penny running at me.

8062
06:12:08,060 --> 06:12:08,400
What?

8063
06:12:09,980 --> 06:12:10,960
He's out.

8064
06:12:12,300 --> 06:12:12,900
He's out.

8065
06:12:13,180 --> 06:12:13,700
He's out.

8066
06:12:14,180 --> 06:12:16,600
Oh, there's a red beacon!

8067
06:12:17,760 --> 06:12:19,160
You can't get healed up there, by the way.

8068
06:12:19,280 --> 06:12:20,540
You know you can't get healed up there.

8069
06:12:21,060 --> 06:12:22,280
You guys can't.

8070
06:12:22,560 --> 06:12:24,620
Dude, there was a red beacon up there that we didn't get.

8071
06:12:28,970 --> 06:12:29,890
Bro, I can't.

8072
06:12:30,090 --> 06:12:31,890
Oh my god, they just keep...

8073
06:12:31,890 --> 06:12:33,310
I don't think we should fight.

8074
06:12:33,390 --> 06:12:34,590
They literally just lock us.

8075
06:12:35,310 --> 06:12:37,010
They just keep locking people in there.

8076
06:12:38,530 --> 06:12:39,410
Yeah, we need to go left.

8077
06:12:39,410 --> 06:12:42,470
Yeah, I can't do anything about it.

8078
06:12:49,790 --> 06:12:51,790
Yeah, I can't do anything.

8079
06:12:56,080 --> 06:12:58,260
Oh my god, this spot is fucking...

8080
06:12:58,260 --> 06:12:59,160
fucking baller.

8081
06:13:01,320 --> 06:13:02,960
I think we should go left.

8082
06:13:03,640 --> 06:13:04,600
Yeah, let's go there.

8083
06:13:04,980 --> 06:13:06,660
We're trying to put pressure on them on the right.

8084
06:13:06,660 --> 06:13:09,320
Their group literally just kept walling us off.

8085
06:13:12,560 --> 06:13:13,500
What the fuck?

8086
06:13:15,680 --> 06:13:17,540
There's also a red beacon up there.

8087
06:13:17,580 --> 06:13:17,880
Go left.

8088
06:13:19,680 --> 06:13:21,340
I'm just trying to keep you up.

8089
06:13:23,900 --> 06:13:24,720
I can't fight.

8090
06:13:25,260 --> 06:13:25,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8091
06:13:26,880 --> 06:13:29,200
You should back up into my bubble if you can.

8092
06:13:29,640 --> 06:13:31,220
Oh my god, I'm fucking fine.

8093
06:13:31,900 --> 06:13:32,180
Alright.

8094
06:13:32,820 --> 06:13:35,300
Oh my god, he threw the mine at me.

8095
06:13:36,380 --> 06:13:36,880
Ow.

8096
06:13:36,880 --> 06:13:37,880
I killed Luna.

8097
06:13:38,720 --> 06:13:40,120
She just got rezzed.

8098
06:13:40,760 --> 06:13:41,580
She got rezzed on height.

8099
06:13:42,140 --> 06:13:42,760
To your left, Namor.

8100
06:13:44,340 --> 06:13:45,460
Alright, Namor died instantly.

8101
06:13:46,340 --> 06:13:46,720
Oof.

8102
06:13:48,200 --> 06:13:49,640
I took the risk with that ult.

8103
06:13:49,840 --> 06:13:50,960
It was not a good risk.

8104
06:13:53,940 --> 06:13:57,180
There's always a 50-50 when it comes to the mines like that.

8105
06:14:02,320 --> 06:14:03,140
Oh my god.

8106
06:14:04,260 --> 06:14:05,140
I don't know where I should go.

8107
06:14:05,740 --> 06:14:06,220
Hmm.

8108
06:14:07,140 --> 06:14:09,740
I could go low-key here.

8109
06:14:09,760 --> 06:14:10,740
I just ulted.

8110
06:14:10,980 --> 06:14:11,300
Whatever.

8111
06:14:13,040 --> 06:14:14,380
We can't heal you though.

8112
06:14:14,540 --> 06:14:15,240
We can't heal you.

8113
06:14:18,100 --> 06:14:18,800
Oh, Namor.

8114
06:14:18,800 --> 06:14:20,320
I got the Sunlock ult and I killed the Namor.

8115
06:14:20,840 --> 06:14:24,220
What the fuck?

8116
06:14:24,720 --> 06:14:26,880
Where did that mine come from?

8117
06:14:27,480 --> 06:14:28,720
It can walk from...

8118
06:14:28,720 --> 06:14:31,780
If she connects her webs, the mines can walk along them from her shaft.

8119
06:14:31,800 --> 06:14:33,460
Oh my, that's so broken.

8120
06:14:33,460 --> 06:14:34,820
I didn't even know that.

8121
06:14:35,280 --> 06:14:36,680
I was like, what?

8122
06:14:37,540 --> 06:14:38,620
How did that get here?

8123
06:14:42,080 --> 06:14:42,980
Got you.

8124
06:14:43,560 --> 06:14:44,580
This is the last fight.

8125
06:14:50,280 --> 06:14:53,020
I got like...

8126
06:14:53,020 --> 06:14:53,320
Yeah.

8127
06:14:55,680 --> 06:14:56,720
Yeah, I couldn't.

8128
06:14:56,760 --> 06:14:57,680
I got Psylocked.

8129
06:15:05,470 --> 06:15:06,050
I...

8130
06:15:06,050 --> 06:15:08,570
Oh, we lost the Luna ult.

8131
06:15:08,570 --> 06:15:09,670
Oh, we lost the Luna ult?

8132
06:15:09,890 --> 06:15:10,070
Okay.

8133
06:15:13,710 --> 06:15:16,130
No way he doesn't die there.

8134
06:15:18,470 --> 06:15:20,370
I just think we just didn't have tank waves.

8135
06:15:21,070 --> 06:15:22,010
Jesus Christ.

8136
06:15:22,130 --> 06:15:24,210
I almost hate the mine there.

8137
06:15:24,830 --> 06:15:25,950
I don't have...

8138
06:15:27,430 --> 06:15:32,530
I feel scared to ult this after last time I exploded.

8139
06:15:32,530 --> 06:15:34,610
We have to go though.

8140
06:15:35,050 --> 06:15:36,490
I did a quick portal.

8141
06:15:45,690 --> 06:15:48,070
I can't dash because of the Nemoro.

8142
06:15:48,850 --> 06:15:49,430
Damn.

8143
06:15:51,550 --> 06:15:54,590
There's so many fucking things.

8144
06:15:55,170 --> 06:15:55,910
I can't...

8145
06:15:55,910 --> 06:15:57,110
I can't live through this.

8146
06:15:58,290 --> 06:16:01,870
We're getting so unlucky getting no tank players every single game.

8147
06:16:01,870 --> 06:16:03,610
Alright, do we know any tank friends?

8148
06:16:03,810 --> 06:16:04,250
Do we...

8149
06:16:06,410 --> 06:16:07,490
Call up xQc.

8150
06:16:07,510 --> 06:16:09,410
I might have to start doing it every game.

8151
06:16:09,630 --> 06:16:11,130
I might just bite the bullet.

8152
06:16:11,570 --> 06:16:12,450
And play tank?

8153
06:16:13,930 --> 06:16:15,290
I suppose I can.

8154
06:16:15,970 --> 06:16:16,530
I'll play Duke.

8155
06:16:17,010 --> 06:16:18,710
Fucking strange if it's open.

8156
06:16:20,930 --> 06:16:22,090
And then this point...

8157
06:16:22,090 --> 06:16:23,070
It's just...

8158
06:16:23,070 --> 06:16:25,590
The reason why we're losing is just we don't have tank players.

8159
06:16:27,030 --> 06:16:28,510
Ah, it's so fucked.

8160
06:16:29,790 --> 06:16:31,150
It actually is.

8161
06:16:33,390 --> 06:16:40,170
The fact that we don't... Like, everyone individually are good players, but we just don't have anyone that actually can play tank.

8162
06:16:41,790 --> 06:16:42,670
Especially like...

8163
06:16:42,670 --> 06:16:48,950
Because the previous game I played tank and went fine, but those tank players were just so much better because they play their role.

8164
06:16:48,950 --> 06:16:49,110
Yeah.

8165
06:16:56,270 --> 06:16:57,910
I think like... I don't know.

8166
06:16:57,910 --> 06:16:59,450
Visually we all did okay.

8167
06:16:59,810 --> 06:17:00,950
I just don't think we...

8168
06:17:01,510 --> 06:17:02,970
We just don't have tank players.

8169
06:17:03,290 --> 06:17:03,870
What is this?

8170
06:17:08,550 --> 06:17:10,470
Wait, the sleep guy was the group player.

8171
06:17:10,590 --> 06:17:11,270
He was really good.

8172
06:17:11,510 --> 06:17:11,910
Wasn't he?

8173
06:17:13,190 --> 06:17:13,610
Maybe?

8174
06:17:13,890 --> 06:17:14,630
I don't remember.

8175
06:17:14,990 --> 06:17:15,770
No, I remember.

8176
06:17:15,870 --> 06:17:16,790
He was the tank player.

8177
06:17:16,790 --> 06:17:19,490
I don't know if he actually played tank or was a filly.

8178
06:17:20,030 --> 06:17:22,570
They have our group on their team from last game.

8179
06:17:23,250 --> 06:17:25,850
I don't really know if our group was good or not, honestly.

8180
06:17:27,550 --> 06:17:27,930
Oh look!

8181
06:17:28,070 --> 06:17:28,670
Oh my god!

8182
06:17:28,730 --> 06:17:29,750
We have a strange locker?

8183
06:17:30,310 --> 06:17:30,990
Oh my god!

8184
06:17:32,010 --> 06:17:33,830
Oh wait, that was you.

8185
06:17:34,590 --> 06:17:36,190
Oh my god, it's working!

8186
06:17:37,710 --> 06:17:38,390
Wait, okay.

8187
06:17:38,450 --> 06:17:39,170
We just win this game.

8188
06:17:39,730 --> 06:17:40,350
Oh my god!

8189
06:17:40,690 --> 06:17:42,470
Bruce or Hawkeye first?

8190
06:17:43,390 --> 06:17:43,790
Hawkeye.

8191
06:17:44,410 --> 06:17:44,890
Hawkeye.

8192
06:17:45,250 --> 06:17:46,110
Always Hawkeye.

8193
06:17:46,250 --> 06:17:47,610
I'm too traumatized.

8194
06:17:49,570 --> 06:17:50,670
Oh my god, he's a natural.

8195
06:17:50,870 --> 06:17:53,190
Guys, we have a doctor on Dr. Strange.

8196
06:17:55,010 --> 06:17:56,490
Oh my god, thank god.

8197
06:18:02,860 --> 06:18:04,060
And then Bruce, right?

8198
06:18:09,340 --> 06:18:10,500
I'm banning Bruce.

8199
06:18:12,120 --> 06:18:13,360
Yeah, they got the hella.

8200
06:18:15,400 --> 06:18:16,840
They definitely got the hella.

8201
06:18:17,180 --> 06:18:18,800
Dr. Unique!

8202
06:18:19,460 --> 06:18:23,720
Yeah, he's a doctor, so of course he's gonna be on Dr. Strange.

8203
06:18:29,470 --> 06:18:30,850
There's another 3-stack?

8204
06:18:32,210 --> 06:18:37,810
Well, 3-stacks tries to match 3-stack always matches other 3-stacks.

8205
06:18:38,490 --> 06:18:39,430
Oh my god, this is it.

8206
06:18:39,510 --> 06:18:40,630
If we lose, we're just bad.

8207
06:18:42,470 --> 06:18:44,430
No, if we lose, our teammates are bad.

8208
06:18:44,830 --> 06:18:46,090
If we lose, it's us.

8209
06:18:46,250 --> 06:18:46,990
We're the problem.

8210
06:18:47,490 --> 06:18:49,830
No teammate can save us.

8211
06:18:49,830 --> 06:18:52,490
We have 4 people on their hero.

8212
06:18:52,610 --> 06:18:54,490
How long have I been streaming for?

8213
06:18:55,190 --> 06:18:56,570
Oh my god, 6 hours.

8214
06:18:57,410 --> 06:18:58,270
Oh my grinder.

8215
06:18:58,670 --> 06:19:03,850
Guys, do you think we can win back all the stuff we lost today?

8216
06:19:05,620 --> 06:19:06,250
Eternity today.

8217
06:19:06,830 --> 06:19:13,330
Guys, do you think we can make it back at least even?

8218
06:19:17,070 --> 06:19:20,610
I think I'm either even or up one right now.

8219
06:19:20,610 --> 06:19:22,030
We're definitely...

8220
06:19:22,030 --> 06:19:23,550
Mac and I are definitely not even.

8221
06:19:25,230 --> 06:19:28,230
We need like 4 wins.

8222
06:19:28,550 --> 06:19:30,730
We were so good yesterday.

8223
06:19:32,330 --> 06:19:33,610
We farmed.

8224
06:19:33,610 --> 06:19:37,670
We farmed yesterday, but today our team matches are so bad.

8225
06:19:39,630 --> 06:19:42,130
All the tank players have fucking families.

8226
06:19:43,050 --> 06:19:43,570
Yeah.

8227
06:19:44,170 --> 06:19:46,270
They're celebrating Christmas and shit, man.

8228
06:19:46,510 --> 06:19:47,270
Come on, losers.

8229
06:19:48,350 --> 06:19:49,230
Get on Rivals, bro.

8230
06:19:49,670 --> 06:19:50,710
We need you in the Qs.

8231
06:19:51,550 --> 06:19:52,790
Don't have families.

8232
06:19:57,970 --> 06:19:59,110
Aw, they're playing Rocket.

8233
06:19:59,810 --> 06:20:01,530
Oh, what the fuck just killed me?

8234
06:20:02,170 --> 06:20:02,570
Psylocke?

8235
06:20:04,290 --> 06:20:05,430
I'm worried now.

8236
06:20:05,750 --> 06:20:07,630
But where's their Psy...

8237
06:20:08,850 --> 06:20:13,150
Their Psylocke might come for me, so I'm just gonna go into this corner.

8238
06:20:14,190 --> 06:20:15,090
Oh, no.

8239
06:20:17,850 --> 06:20:18,790
Psylocke in hole.

8240
06:20:20,070 --> 06:20:21,130
Is it Psylocke?

8241
06:20:21,410 --> 06:20:22,410
He's like half.

8242
06:20:24,010 --> 06:20:25,050
I broke the red beacon.

8243
06:20:25,450 --> 06:20:26,370
Psylocke to our right.

8244
06:20:29,790 --> 06:20:30,410
Where is he?

8245
06:20:32,150 --> 06:20:33,330
We got one.

8246
06:20:35,190 --> 06:20:36,330
Their Penny's one.

8247
06:20:36,970 --> 06:20:38,270
We need a cap soon, though.

8248
06:20:39,230 --> 06:20:39,870
Their Penny can die.

8249
06:20:39,870 --> 06:20:41,830
Penny dead.

8250
06:20:47,090 --> 06:20:48,710
Bro, why didn't you wake him up?

8251
06:20:48,730 --> 06:20:49,550
Oh, thank God.

8252
06:20:49,690 --> 06:20:50,850
I'm fucking happy.

8253
06:20:51,670 --> 06:20:53,530
You like woke him up.

8254
06:20:56,890 --> 06:20:57,830
Oh, my God.

8255
06:20:58,330 --> 06:20:58,910
I got you.

8256
06:20:59,810 --> 06:21:02,890
Okay, huge.

8257
06:21:06,750 --> 06:21:08,350
Oh, Dr. Unique, please live.

8258
06:21:08,590 --> 06:21:09,550
You're so unique.

8259
06:21:10,970 --> 06:21:12,070
Oh, this is perfect.

8260
06:21:12,070 --> 06:21:13,790
I'm gonna use my ult after this.

8261
06:21:13,950 --> 06:21:14,810
I have to hide.

8262
06:21:14,950 --> 06:21:16,410
I'm hiding.

8263
06:21:17,810 --> 06:21:19,250
We used Mantis ult.

8264
06:21:19,290 --> 06:21:20,370
We double-spoilt it.

8265
06:21:23,750 --> 06:21:25,150
I'm damage boosting this.

8266
06:21:26,150 --> 06:21:27,730
Let's use everything.

8267
06:21:28,910 --> 06:21:30,270
I don't mind that.

8268
06:21:31,790 --> 06:21:32,950
There's a Penny up top.

8269
06:21:33,610 --> 06:21:39,630
And he lives.

8270
06:21:40,810 --> 06:21:44,310
Can you tell Mantis Luna first, then Mantis.

8271
06:21:50,090 --> 06:21:51,850
We don't double-spoilt ult.

8272
06:21:56,030 --> 06:21:58,190
I literally can't heal this.

8273
06:21:58,550 --> 06:21:59,750
I'm trying to shoot it up.

8274
06:22:00,070 --> 06:22:02,730
There's literally a wall in front of you.

8275
06:22:06,090 --> 06:22:07,870
I'm in the air if you can give a heal up top.

8276
06:22:08,110 --> 06:22:08,930
I have to.

8277
06:22:08,930 --> 06:22:09,790
I'm trying to...

8278
06:22:09,790 --> 06:22:11,610
I can't.

8279
06:22:11,610 --> 06:22:12,050
I can't.

8280
06:22:12,050 --> 06:22:12,890
I can't peek now.

8281
06:22:13,650 --> 06:22:15,230
No, Groot just two-tapped me.

8282
06:22:23,260 --> 06:22:24,380
We can't.

8283
06:22:24,400 --> 06:22:24,840
We can't.

8284
06:22:25,000 --> 06:22:25,920
I don't know...

8285
06:22:25,920 --> 06:22:29,240
Their Groot blocked the door.

8286
06:22:29,760 --> 06:22:30,340
I'm backing out.

8287
06:22:35,280 --> 06:22:36,580
I got you.

8288
06:22:37,720 --> 06:22:41,570
I got you.

8289
06:22:41,570 --> 06:22:42,770
I got you.

8290
06:22:45,070 --> 06:22:47,170
I got the Groot, though.

8291
06:22:48,290 --> 06:22:50,090
Jesus, you're taking so much damage.

8292
06:22:51,830 --> 06:22:53,150
Okay, that's Luna.

8293
06:22:53,170 --> 06:22:55,370
Wait, did you tell them Mantis Luna?

8294
06:22:55,730 --> 06:22:56,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8295
06:22:59,790 --> 06:23:00,750
I'm ulting.

8296
06:23:04,930 --> 06:23:08,250
Oh my god, we're coordinated, Mantis!

8297
06:23:08,250 --> 06:23:10,370
We're doing it!

8298
06:23:11,490 --> 06:23:12,490
We're coordinating!

8299
06:23:13,430 --> 06:23:14,190
I killed three.

8300
06:23:14,410 --> 06:23:14,930
That's all I can do.

8301
06:23:15,250 --> 06:23:16,670
Let's kill this Raccoon, too.

8302
06:23:17,270 --> 06:23:18,490
Fuck this Raccoon.

8303
06:23:19,470 --> 06:23:20,190
Fuck him up.

8304
06:23:21,250 --> 06:23:22,530
Turn him into Roadkill.

8305
06:23:23,210 --> 06:23:24,690
Okay, the Raccoon ran away.

8306
06:23:27,590 --> 06:23:29,230
And the fish guy.

8307
06:23:32,110 --> 06:23:33,510
Yeah, they used Luna.

8308
06:23:33,610 --> 06:23:35,250
I'm gonna go for my ult this fight.

8309
06:23:35,250 --> 06:23:36,530
Yeah, it's fine.

8310
06:23:39,710 --> 06:23:41,250
Oh my god.

8311
06:23:42,130 --> 06:23:43,430
Chat, this...

8312
06:23:43,430 --> 06:23:46,030
This game is so much more difficult.

8313
06:23:46,030 --> 06:23:47,150
Holy fucking mines.

8314
06:23:47,930 --> 06:23:48,250
Yeah.

8315
06:23:51,550 --> 06:23:52,690
What did they do?

8316
06:23:53,470 --> 06:23:53,910
Groot!

8317
06:23:54,490 --> 06:23:54,790
Groot!

8318
06:23:56,690 --> 06:23:57,570
Oh, that's huge, that's huge!

8319
06:23:58,230 --> 06:24:02,130
I froze the Mantis Penny, too!

8320
06:24:03,930 --> 06:24:05,050
Oh, it doesn't matter.

8321
06:24:05,110 --> 06:24:09,290
Oh my god!

8322
06:24:09,450 --> 06:24:10,130
Penny one, Penny one!

8323
06:24:16,920 --> 06:24:17,280
Alright.

8324
06:24:17,800 --> 06:24:20,300
I've never been so sweaty before in Marvelous.

8325
06:24:22,540 --> 06:24:23,940
I'm fucking impassioned.

8326
06:24:24,060 --> 06:24:26,240
I want my points back.

8327
06:24:27,880 --> 06:24:29,820
We will get them back.

8328
06:24:30,480 --> 06:24:30,900
I'm 1HP.

8329
06:24:30,960 --> 06:24:31,620
We're not 1HP.

8330
06:24:31,800 --> 06:24:32,680
We're not 1HP.

8331
06:24:32,820 --> 06:24:34,180
I'm literally...

8332
06:24:36,780 --> 06:24:38,400
The face of a liar.

8333
06:24:38,980 --> 06:24:39,500
Yeah.

8334
06:24:40,120 --> 06:24:41,580
Who desperately wants heals.

8335
06:24:42,700 --> 06:24:43,820
Oh my god.

8336
06:24:44,080 --> 06:24:45,380
No way, bro!

8337
06:24:45,400 --> 06:24:46,480
I'm not ulting you.

8338
06:24:46,820 --> 06:24:47,540
It's just you.

8339
06:24:47,620 --> 06:24:48,600
I'm not ulting this.

8340
06:24:49,440 --> 06:24:51,920
It's literally just you that got hit!

8341
06:24:52,420 --> 06:24:54,080
That's so fucked up!

8342
06:24:54,660 --> 06:24:56,060
Like, I can't do any...

8343
06:24:56,060 --> 06:24:58,140
Like, I'm not gonna solo ult for you.

8344
06:24:58,480 --> 06:24:58,920
No, no, no.

8345
06:24:58,960 --> 06:25:00,240
I'm saying, why did they solo me?

8346
06:25:00,240 --> 06:25:02,880
Yeah, they solo ulted you, but I was not solo ulting.

8347
06:25:02,880 --> 06:25:03,580
No, no, no.

8348
06:25:03,660 --> 06:25:05,800
It was worth that I got that out.

8349
06:25:05,840 --> 06:25:06,900
But it's like, why the fuck did they solo me?

8350
06:25:06,900 --> 06:25:07,060
Mac!

8351
06:25:07,960 --> 06:25:08,080
Mac!

8352
06:25:08,520 --> 06:25:08,520
Mac!

8353
06:25:09,860 --> 06:25:10,220
Why?!

8354
06:25:11,200 --> 06:25:11,560
Why?!

8355
06:25:12,540 --> 06:25:14,540
I should have yelled at you to get back here.

8356
06:25:16,500 --> 06:25:18,340
The Psylocke above me, I didn't know.

8357
06:25:19,060 --> 06:25:21,900
You were literally by yourself.

8358
06:25:24,900 --> 06:25:25,820
Okay, I got it.

8359
06:25:26,080 --> 06:25:27,180
Psylocke behind!

8360
06:25:28,120 --> 06:25:28,660
That's fine.

8361
06:25:28,760 --> 06:25:29,500
I have my ult.

8362
06:25:31,100 --> 06:25:31,800
I have my ult.

8363
06:25:31,800 --> 06:25:32,840
I have my ult here.

8364
06:25:33,060 --> 06:25:34,020
I killed her.

8365
06:25:34,300 --> 06:25:34,660
Nice.

8366
06:25:37,170 --> 06:25:37,820
That's huge!

8367
06:25:39,240 --> 06:25:41,500
Penny is fucking bouncing up and down.

8368
06:25:42,460 --> 06:25:45,480
Oh my god, that's not...

8369
06:25:47,430 --> 06:25:48,910
That's fine.

8370
06:25:53,540 --> 06:25:56,920
Guys, there's literally just this Penny that's just chilling there.

8371
06:25:57,520 --> 06:25:58,360
Penny is solo.

8372
06:25:59,440 --> 06:26:00,140
I...

8373
06:26:00,140 --> 06:26:02,020
I hate these mines.

8374
06:26:02,620 --> 06:26:04,140
There were so many.

8375
06:26:04,220 --> 06:26:05,140
Where do I go?

8376
06:26:05,620 --> 06:26:07,620
Where do I go to be alive?

8377
06:26:08,980 --> 06:26:12,440
My first fucking...

8378
06:26:12,440 --> 06:26:14,400
I should have went left instead of forward.

8379
06:26:19,980 --> 06:26:21,260
I know.

8380
06:26:24,180 --> 06:26:24,820
Please.

8381
06:26:25,180 --> 06:26:27,380
It was my one death.

8382
06:26:30,140 --> 06:26:31,480
Every other...

8383
06:26:31,480 --> 06:26:35,280
I was playing out of my mind until that death.

8384
06:26:38,700 --> 06:26:40,540
Wait, what happened?

8385
06:26:40,940 --> 06:26:43,220
I walked into all the mines.

8386
06:26:45,240 --> 06:26:46,500
It's her.

8387
06:26:47,200 --> 06:26:50,980
Then the strange watched me walk into all the mines.

8388
06:26:51,740 --> 06:26:52,160
Perfect.

8389
06:26:53,200 --> 06:26:54,300
You know what?

8390
06:26:54,340 --> 06:26:55,380
Sometimes it happens.

8391
06:27:02,940 --> 06:27:05,040
Thank you, doctor.

8392
06:27:05,820 --> 06:27:09,380
I don't have health insurance, so...

8393
06:27:14,660 --> 06:27:19,480
Damn, should have told him that afterwards.

8394
06:27:21,060 --> 06:27:23,220
Maybe he'll do it pro bono.

8395
06:27:23,220 --> 06:27:24,540
Oh, yeah.

8396
06:27:30,800 --> 06:27:32,320
Maybe we should invite him.

8397
06:27:32,380 --> 06:27:33,200
I like this guy.

8398
06:27:36,420 --> 06:27:38,300
Bro, I don't mind playing with Doctor Unique.

8399
06:27:38,400 --> 06:27:39,360
I like this guy.

8400
06:27:40,920 --> 06:27:43,700
Yo, guys, I think there's some spider mines in front.

8401
06:27:43,720 --> 06:27:44,180
Let's pick him up.

8402
06:27:44,200 --> 06:27:45,240
There might be some bombs.

8403
06:27:47,480 --> 06:27:48,360
Doctor Unique.

8404
06:27:54,340 --> 06:27:56,580
My strongest doctor, bro.

8405
06:27:56,640 --> 06:27:58,680
This is the guy doing my brain surgery.

8406
06:27:59,640 --> 06:28:01,380
I got fished!

8407
06:28:01,420 --> 06:28:03,220
He was the guy, I was like...

8408
06:28:03,800 --> 06:28:04,660
Oh my god.

8409
06:28:05,380 --> 06:28:07,460
Guys, what happened?

8410
06:28:07,660 --> 06:28:08,360
What's going on?

8411
06:28:09,300 --> 06:28:10,900
I need to rebook my appointment.

8412
06:28:11,360 --> 06:28:11,760
Fuck this.

8413
06:28:12,760 --> 06:28:19,520
Okay, Mr. Sleep is not getting the memo right now.

8414
06:28:19,900 --> 06:28:22,120
By the way, you have no support in your poor lariat.

8415
06:28:22,540 --> 06:28:23,640
I'm him.

8416
06:28:26,680 --> 06:28:28,280
I walked into a mine.

8417
06:28:29,080 --> 06:28:30,500
Oh my god.

8418
06:28:30,620 --> 06:28:31,760
I froze him.

8419
06:28:35,020 --> 06:28:36,520
That's fucking karma.

8420
06:28:41,610 --> 06:28:43,550
I have spider on me.

8421
06:28:43,950 --> 06:28:44,730
He froze him again.

8422
06:28:46,510 --> 06:28:48,610
I know somebody hit him.

8423
06:28:53,590 --> 06:28:54,110
Please.

8424
06:28:54,310 --> 06:28:54,710
Dude.

8425
06:28:55,470 --> 06:28:56,310
I can ult this.

8426
06:28:56,490 --> 06:28:57,190
Is it worth ulting?

8427
06:28:59,110 --> 06:29:00,250
I think so.

8428
06:29:00,830 --> 06:29:01,230
Okay.

8429
06:29:02,290 --> 06:29:03,950
It's fine, you guys are fine.

8430
06:29:06,270 --> 06:29:08,710
I am ulting this for our group.

8431
06:29:09,090 --> 06:29:10,210
Oh, I fucked up.

8432
06:29:10,870 --> 06:29:12,390
Okay, I don't know.

8433
06:29:12,510 --> 06:29:14,010
I don't think it was worth ulting it.

8434
06:29:15,070 --> 06:29:15,890
Ah, shit.

8435
06:29:16,390 --> 06:29:17,630
I couldn't.

8436
06:29:17,630 --> 06:29:19,370
He body blocked me.

8437
06:29:21,050 --> 06:29:23,350
I think we got regrouped.

8438
06:29:24,790 --> 06:29:27,770
Yeah, we're just staggering in over and over again.

8439
06:29:30,490 --> 06:29:32,310
And we used both support ults.

8440
06:29:34,410 --> 06:29:38,710
Wait, we can totally kill Penny here.

8441
06:29:39,870 --> 06:29:41,050
Yeah, but they have rez.

8442
06:29:42,010 --> 06:29:43,970
I'm just gonna go in and ult.

8443
06:29:43,970 --> 06:29:45,710
I'm here.

8444
06:29:45,810 --> 06:29:46,450
I have your orb on you.

8445
06:29:46,510 --> 06:29:48,470
I'm ulting.

8446
06:29:52,450 --> 06:29:55,310
I don't see you for...

8447
06:29:55,310 --> 06:29:55,610
Okay.

8448
06:29:59,110 --> 06:30:00,890
Oh, his ult is still going.

8449
06:30:00,990 --> 06:30:02,950
Yeah, nothing crit ulted.

8450
06:30:03,530 --> 06:30:05,030
We have three fights left.

8451
06:30:06,610 --> 06:30:08,190
Or two fights actually.

8452
06:30:09,370 --> 06:30:12,750
We have a crit ult and a snowball in the face.

8453
06:30:13,410 --> 06:30:16,530
We don't have support ults, I don't think so.

8454
06:30:19,150 --> 06:30:20,590
I gave you...

8455
06:30:20,590 --> 06:30:22,390
There's so many fish up there, man.

8456
06:30:22,630 --> 06:30:23,510
I got one of them.

8457
06:30:23,850 --> 06:30:25,410
What are fish doing in the sky?

8458
06:30:29,610 --> 06:30:33,670
Fish got...

8459
06:30:34,000 --> 06:30:35,130
I got you.

8460
06:30:37,350 --> 06:30:40,710
This might be our last fight if we stall it here.

8461
06:30:42,030 --> 06:30:44,250
Oh, their Punisher's one.

8462
06:30:46,490 --> 06:30:48,030
I'm trying to find their rez.

8463
06:30:52,630 --> 06:30:54,650
Their Namor's still on top right.

8464
06:30:54,890 --> 06:30:55,370
Punisher's low.

8465
06:30:58,890 --> 06:31:01,610
I'm on point.

8466
06:31:03,750 --> 06:31:04,670
Then I can die.

8467
06:31:05,870 --> 06:31:06,870
That's huge.

8468
06:31:06,970 --> 06:31:08,550
Dude, their Namor's one top.

8469
06:31:08,550 --> 06:31:10,190
Raccoon, raccoon, raccoon!

8470
06:31:12,090 --> 06:31:12,850
Groot, please!

8471
06:31:13,370 --> 06:31:14,190
Groot's on point!

8472
06:31:14,490 --> 06:31:15,970
Literally, a Groob and a Namor on point.

8473
06:31:17,750 --> 06:31:18,910
Please, Groot and Namor.

8474
06:31:19,630 --> 06:31:20,690
I can't survive.

8475
06:31:20,790 --> 06:31:21,670
I can't survive here.

8476
06:31:25,860 --> 06:31:27,440
We need one on point.

8477
06:31:29,340 --> 06:31:30,920
We need three on point.

8478
06:31:32,900 --> 06:31:33,460
Okay, nice.

8479
06:31:33,700 --> 06:31:33,880
Okay.

8480
06:31:36,220 --> 06:31:36,700
Alright.

8481
06:31:36,700 --> 06:31:38,880
That was stressful, guys.

8482
06:31:39,180 --> 06:31:40,200
Yeah, a little bit.

8483
06:31:40,300 --> 06:31:42,180
Oh, I killed myself.

8484
06:31:48,930 --> 06:31:49,230
Alright.

8485
06:31:50,350 --> 06:31:52,450
Please, Mantis, you're stressing me the fuck out.

8486
06:31:57,590 --> 06:31:58,710
I am...

8487
06:31:59,890 --> 06:32:01,810
I just got two-tapped out of spawn.

8488
06:32:06,210 --> 06:32:08,510
Yeah, we're not saving Doctor.

8489
06:32:09,730 --> 06:32:11,370
I'm not saving that guy.

8490
06:32:11,370 --> 06:32:11,470
Yeah.

8491
06:32:12,090 --> 06:32:15,250
I'm just trying to...

8492
06:32:15,250 --> 06:32:17,710
Whoa, I froze the Groot, though.

8493
06:32:21,030 --> 06:32:22,310
Oh, Mantis.

8494
06:32:23,550 --> 06:32:24,370
Namor's one.

8495
06:32:24,470 --> 06:32:25,410
I'm tipped to mines.

8496
06:32:29,470 --> 06:32:30,890
We got our Groob.

8497
06:32:31,050 --> 06:32:31,490
We're staggering.

8498
06:32:31,730 --> 06:32:35,070
We're literally going in one by one.

8499
06:32:37,090 --> 06:32:39,950
Yeah, but we're still staggering.

8500
06:32:39,950 --> 06:32:42,410
We're literally looking out.

8501
06:32:45,570 --> 06:32:46,210
Guys?

8502
06:32:47,730 --> 06:32:48,810
Guys, please.

8503
06:32:49,610 --> 06:32:50,490
I'm waiting in spawn.

8504
06:32:50,750 --> 06:32:53,170
I'm waiting in spawn.

8505
06:32:56,070 --> 06:32:58,050
I don't trust any of you guys anymore.

8506
06:32:59,530 --> 06:33:00,470
Oh, mine.

8507
06:33:02,130 --> 06:33:02,770
I have ult.

8508
06:33:09,820 --> 06:33:10,680
Penny does.

8509
06:33:10,860 --> 06:33:11,220
Penny does.

8510
06:33:11,220 --> 06:33:11,720
Yeah.

8511
06:33:13,120 --> 06:33:15,160
I froze Groot.

8512
06:33:19,540 --> 06:33:20,900
I'm trying to peek you for a heal.

8513
06:33:21,040 --> 06:33:22,600
Okay, I'm ulting.

8514
06:33:22,600 --> 06:33:23,520
I'm ulting this for us.

8515
06:33:25,460 --> 06:33:26,380
We have...

8516
06:33:26,380 --> 06:33:27,700
Guys, guys, Namor, Namor, Namor!

8517
06:33:27,960 --> 06:33:29,080
Please, please, please, Namor!

8518
06:33:29,540 --> 06:33:30,000
Guys!

8519
06:33:32,460 --> 06:33:33,640
There we go.

8520
06:33:34,980 --> 06:33:35,440
Penny?

8521
06:33:35,900 --> 06:33:36,620
Penny low.

8522
06:33:37,420 --> 06:33:39,220
I'm gonna break something.

8523
06:33:42,540 --> 06:33:43,120
I'm dead.

8524
06:33:43,120 --> 06:33:43,660
Penny dead.

8525
06:33:44,440 --> 06:33:45,300
Rocket, rocket.

8526
06:33:45,740 --> 06:33:47,000
There's a rez up there.

8527
06:33:47,480 --> 06:33:49,480
I can't heal because I'm on point.

8528
06:33:49,620 --> 06:33:50,620
You're getting Luinta's heals.

8529
06:33:54,840 --> 06:33:56,000
Rocket's dead.

8530
06:34:07,830 --> 06:34:09,450
Their Penny's pretty low.

8531
06:34:09,870 --> 06:34:10,390
I froze him.

8532
06:34:10,490 --> 06:34:11,670
Please, please.

8533
06:34:12,150 --> 06:34:13,090
Oh, thank god.

8534
06:34:17,970 --> 06:34:18,690
I'm dead.

8535
06:34:18,690 --> 06:34:19,270
I can't...

8536
06:34:19,270 --> 06:34:20,690
I was gonna say I can't.

8537
06:34:20,830 --> 06:34:21,590
This is overtime.

8538
06:34:24,870 --> 06:34:26,930
I'll get there quickly with ult.

8539
06:34:28,710 --> 06:34:30,310
Our Groot's going crazy.

8540
06:34:31,260 --> 06:34:31,550
Yes!

8541
06:34:31,590 --> 06:34:32,550
Oh my god!

8542
06:34:33,370 --> 06:34:34,070
So free.

8543
06:34:35,270 --> 06:34:37,190
Oh my god!

8544
06:34:37,650 --> 06:34:39,770
Soon I'm playing out of my fucking mind there.

8545
06:34:39,770 --> 06:34:42,310
Honestly, the chillest game I've ever had.

8546
06:34:42,310 --> 06:34:43,230
I literally...

8547
06:34:43,230 --> 06:34:44,770
Oh my god!

8548
06:34:45,370 --> 06:34:50,510
I was gonna break a table if we lost because I'm the most fucking solid in the game.

8549
06:34:51,970 --> 06:34:54,510
I was gonna break something.

8550
06:34:56,450 --> 06:34:58,370
Wait, you did get the drip.

8551
06:34:59,250 --> 06:35:00,950
Of course I got the drip.

8552
06:35:01,530 --> 06:35:02,210
Goddamn.

8553
06:35:02,830 --> 06:35:03,770
Oh my god.

8554
06:35:05,010 --> 06:35:07,070
I'm officially up one.

8555
06:35:07,390 --> 06:35:08,370
I was so mad.

8556
06:35:08,370 --> 06:35:10,330
It's like...

8557
06:35:10,330 --> 06:35:19,630
I was... Okay, the thing that tilted me the most was that I was screaming about the Nemoir and then I saw Ruben not even turn around.

8558
06:35:22,510 --> 06:35:23,290
That's...

8559
06:35:24,160 --> 06:35:26,270
That's what got me going the most.

8560
06:35:28,490 --> 06:35:30,330
Not even just...

8561
06:35:30,330 --> 06:35:31,730
Not even just Ruben.

8562
06:35:31,870 --> 06:35:34,710
Everybody was just...

8563
06:35:34,710 --> 06:35:37,710
I was about to fucking...

8564
06:35:37,710 --> 06:35:39,270
I was about to punch something.

8565
06:35:43,350 --> 06:35:44,850
Oh my god.

8566
06:35:45,630 --> 06:35:47,190
I was so mad.

8567
06:35:47,630 --> 06:35:49,010
I was so fucking mad.

8568
06:35:49,930 --> 06:35:50,850
Is it Hawkeye?

8569
06:35:52,910 --> 06:35:54,130
Hawkeye, let's go.

8570
06:35:54,310 --> 06:35:55,710
This guy wants to ban Mantis.

8571
06:35:56,190 --> 06:35:57,510
Oh, too bad for him.

8572
06:35:58,130 --> 06:36:00,090
It sucks to fucking suck.

8573
06:36:00,590 --> 06:36:01,910
Oh, he's gonna flip to Mantis.

8574
06:36:01,930 --> 06:36:02,610
I can feel it.

8575
06:36:02,610 --> 06:36:04,590
It always does this to me.

8576
06:36:04,810 --> 06:36:05,630
Oh, thank god.

8577
06:36:06,750 --> 06:36:07,490
Now, who do we ban?

8578
06:36:09,550 --> 06:36:09,990
Bruce.

8579
06:36:12,090 --> 06:36:12,530
Bruce.

8580
06:36:12,630 --> 06:36:13,010
Okay.

8581
06:36:14,650 --> 06:36:16,070
Sucks to be that guy.

8582
06:36:16,470 --> 06:36:18,110
Why is he not curious about Mantis?

8583
06:36:20,370 --> 06:36:22,110
Yeah, they're gonna have a Mantis anyways.

8584
06:36:22,310 --> 06:36:22,730
Yeah.

8585
06:36:24,790 --> 06:36:27,150
It's just because he doesn't want to deal with the defensive bullshit.

8586
06:36:28,390 --> 06:36:32,370
I feel like it's worse to play into Luna with Psylocke.

8587
06:36:32,730 --> 06:36:34,670
Because her ult is even better against your ult.

8588
06:36:34,910 --> 06:36:35,390
Yeah.

8589
06:36:37,530 --> 06:36:40,210
If Mantis has no one around him, you kill through Mantis ult.

8590
06:36:40,510 --> 06:36:41,510
That's basically it.

8591
06:36:41,510 --> 06:36:43,610
This guy took my fucking Psylocke.

8592
06:36:43,950 --> 06:36:45,430
Oh, guess who's tanking again.

8593
06:36:46,750 --> 06:36:47,230
Okay.

8594
06:36:47,750 --> 06:36:49,770
Do we endorse the Captain America pick?

8595
06:36:50,570 --> 06:36:52,510
With Thor, it's actually not bad.

8596
06:36:52,550 --> 06:36:53,690
With Thor, it's actually not bad.

8597
06:36:53,710 --> 06:36:56,590
Yeah, I mean, we could try with Thor.

8598
06:36:57,030 --> 06:36:57,330
Okay.

8599
06:36:57,330 --> 06:36:58,330
We are on offense.

8600
06:36:59,970 --> 06:37:00,210
Yeah.

8601
06:37:02,650 --> 06:37:05,170
Yo, but I do have the best skin in the game.

8602
06:37:05,350 --> 06:37:06,170
Check it out.

8603
06:37:06,690 --> 06:37:09,570
I've been so locked in for like four games now.

8604
06:37:11,130 --> 06:37:12,970
You like my Captain America skin?

8605
06:37:13,890 --> 06:37:14,070
No.

8606
06:37:14,390 --> 06:37:15,870
What the fuck?

8607
06:37:16,210 --> 06:37:17,010
Why is it yellow?

8608
06:37:17,690 --> 06:37:19,250
Yo, I'm Captain Peach, dude.

8609
06:37:19,310 --> 06:37:22,070
What country is that?

8610
06:37:22,710 --> 06:37:23,790
That's not America.

8611
06:37:23,790 --> 06:37:25,110
Is it A for America?

8612
06:37:26,570 --> 06:37:28,170
I'm fighting for Peach, buddy.

8613
06:37:28,270 --> 06:37:29,250
I don't know what to tell you.

8614
06:37:29,390 --> 06:37:29,830
What the fuck?

8615
06:37:30,390 --> 06:37:31,290
A for America?

8616
06:37:32,170 --> 06:37:32,490
Yeah.

8617
06:37:35,770 --> 06:37:36,650
What's the lore?

8618
06:37:37,410 --> 06:37:39,590
Dude, we're matching.

8619
06:37:40,050 --> 06:37:40,610
Okay, guys.

8620
06:37:41,930 --> 06:37:47,150
I just realized I'm going to be on and off mute again because I'm on Mantis and my mute key is bound on F.

8621
06:37:47,670 --> 06:37:49,670
Why is your push to mute F?

8622
06:37:49,670 --> 06:37:50,810
Because it's close.

8623
06:37:50,810 --> 06:37:52,910
It's like so close to me.

8624
06:37:53,190 --> 06:37:54,950
I really like having it off.

8625
06:37:55,810 --> 06:37:59,070
So I can like press it instantly if I need to talk.

8626
06:38:00,230 --> 06:38:01,390
Oh, I'm dead.

8627
06:38:01,870 --> 06:38:02,930
Spider-Man just took my butt.

8628
06:38:03,670 --> 06:38:04,130
It's okay.

8629
06:38:05,090 --> 06:38:06,650
Captain America is on the rooftops.

8630
06:38:07,270 --> 06:38:08,110
Alright, that's fine.

8631
06:38:09,770 --> 06:38:10,710
Do you know what you're doing?

8632
06:38:11,710 --> 06:38:11,950
Yeah.

8633
06:38:12,790 --> 06:38:13,090
Okay.

8634
06:38:16,290 --> 06:38:16,770
I'm...

8635
06:38:17,810 --> 06:38:19,210
I'm pushing up with you guys.

8636
06:38:21,890 --> 06:38:22,690
Do it guys again.

8637
06:38:22,790 --> 06:38:23,270
Do it guys again.

8638
06:38:25,750 --> 06:38:28,330
We can't heal you by the way because it's just me.

8639
06:38:28,490 --> 06:38:29,510
It's just me that's healing.

8640
06:38:29,670 --> 06:38:30,410
Adam can't do it.

8641
06:38:30,510 --> 06:38:30,850
I'm good.

8642
06:38:30,950 --> 06:38:31,150
I'm good.

8643
06:38:31,190 --> 06:38:31,530
I'm good.

8644
06:38:34,310 --> 06:38:35,410
Oh my god.

8645
06:38:35,570 --> 06:38:36,010
No more shifting.

8646
06:38:36,950 --> 06:38:38,490
I'm going to push cart a little bit.

8647
06:38:39,050 --> 06:38:41,050
And then I'll push cart a little bit.

8648
06:38:42,870 --> 06:38:44,010
Alright, I'm pushing up.

8649
06:38:44,130 --> 06:38:44,750
I'm damage boosting.

8650
06:38:44,750 --> 06:38:44,850
I'm damage boosting.

8651
06:38:48,790 --> 06:38:49,670
I got you.

8652
06:38:49,810 --> 06:38:50,270
He's asleep.

8653
06:38:50,330 --> 06:38:50,670
He's asleep.

8654
06:38:51,990 --> 06:38:52,710
Fuck him up.

8655
06:38:54,050 --> 06:38:57,070
I just need to waste a leaf just so I can be able to push the top.

8656
06:38:58,630 --> 06:38:59,030
Okay.

8657
06:39:00,690 --> 06:39:01,410
I got you.

8658
06:39:01,450 --> 06:39:01,810
I got you.

8659
06:39:01,850 --> 06:39:02,270
I got you.

8660
06:39:02,290 --> 06:39:03,570
I got damage boost on you.

8661
06:39:06,190 --> 06:39:07,610
There's more to my left.

8662
06:39:07,910 --> 06:39:08,770
Here's another damage boost.

8663
06:39:09,010 --> 06:39:11,330
We really got to break these walls.

8664
06:39:11,330 --> 06:39:13,350
We are undefeatable.

8665
06:39:13,470 --> 06:39:14,310
I have all here too.

8666
06:39:14,390 --> 06:39:15,130
I'm going to wait a little bit.

8667
06:39:15,610 --> 06:39:16,750
Oh, never mind.

8668
06:39:17,610 --> 06:39:18,250
I got damage.

8669
06:39:19,550 --> 06:39:20,570
Almost fell off the map.

8670
06:39:22,490 --> 06:39:23,250
Please kill the group.

8671
06:39:23,970 --> 06:39:25,170
Oh my god.

8672
06:39:25,330 --> 06:39:26,290
Wait, I'm shielding you.

8673
06:39:26,870 --> 06:39:27,570
I'm okay.

8674
06:39:28,490 --> 06:39:30,230
I'm going to rez up.

8675
06:39:33,330 --> 06:39:35,750
I hope our cocoon boy is okay too.

8676
06:39:36,810 --> 06:39:38,310
I have assemble for next wave.

8677
06:39:38,310 --> 06:39:39,170
Let's do it.

8678
06:39:40,150 --> 06:39:42,830
These walls are really fucking me up.

8679
06:39:44,510 --> 06:39:45,350
I got him.

8680
06:39:46,230 --> 06:39:47,650
I am trying to...

8681
06:39:49,250 --> 06:39:50,830
There's like people over there.

8682
06:39:50,910 --> 06:39:52,290
I don't know if I'm muted or not muted.

8683
06:39:52,430 --> 06:39:54,310
I'm just fucking...

8684
06:39:55,090 --> 06:39:56,730
That's good because I just damage boosted.

8685
06:39:58,470 --> 06:39:58,830
Alright.

8686
06:40:01,350 --> 06:40:01,830
Alright.

8687
06:40:02,510 --> 06:40:03,610
I need a rebind.

8688
06:40:03,610 --> 06:40:03,770
I need a rebind.

8689
06:40:07,430 --> 06:40:09,930
I'm pushing cart right now.

8690
06:40:10,430 --> 06:40:11,550
Okay, I'm coming over.

8691
06:40:11,770 --> 06:40:12,950
I damage boosted you.

8692
06:40:13,110 --> 06:40:14,210
I'm going to push up with you guys.

8693
06:40:17,130 --> 06:40:18,770
I've been standing in the blue orbs.

8694
06:40:18,850 --> 06:40:19,790
Why am I not getting healed?

8695
06:40:19,990 --> 06:40:20,790
It's fucking poor.

8696
06:40:23,730 --> 06:40:24,990
I'm fucking cooked.

8697
06:40:25,090 --> 06:40:26,470
The group pushed up.

8698
06:40:28,130 --> 06:40:29,830
You only have Adam heals.

8699
06:40:32,170 --> 06:40:32,770
Nope.

8700
06:40:33,270 --> 06:40:34,850
We got assemble.

8701
06:40:36,470 --> 06:40:37,790
Most of us are dead.

8702
06:40:39,750 --> 06:40:41,230
I'm healing us.

8703
06:40:41,470 --> 06:40:42,810
I'm the support player now.

8704
06:40:43,010 --> 06:40:44,090
I'm pushing cart.

8705
06:40:45,410 --> 06:40:46,730
Thor is dead though.

8706
06:40:46,970 --> 06:40:48,630
We should settle a little bit.

8707
06:40:49,350 --> 06:40:49,950
You're right.

8708
06:40:52,070 --> 06:40:53,790
America's tank is backing up.

8709
06:40:54,030 --> 06:40:54,270
No.

8710
06:40:55,450 --> 06:40:56,330
I'm rezzing.

8711
06:40:56,330 --> 06:40:58,130
Fucking hell.

8712
06:40:58,830 --> 06:40:59,350
No.

8713
06:41:00,150 --> 06:41:01,710
We died through this.

8714
06:41:02,590 --> 06:41:05,090
No, we reset by dying to the...

8715
06:41:05,090 --> 06:41:06,330
Yeah, by mantis ulted.

8716
06:41:10,070 --> 06:41:11,890
Did they mantis ult as well?

8717
06:41:12,530 --> 06:41:13,090
Yeah, they did.

8718
06:41:14,070 --> 06:41:15,850
Sucks though, I had to mantis ult.

8719
06:41:16,870 --> 06:41:18,170
Wait, he got off Psylocke.

8720
06:41:20,370 --> 06:41:23,590
Actually, this is definitely not a Psylocke map.

8721
06:41:27,990 --> 06:41:28,090
Nice.

8722
06:41:32,010 --> 06:41:34,710
I got heals on you, but not on the support.

8723
06:41:35,950 --> 06:41:36,850
I'm gonna ult here.

8724
06:41:38,930 --> 06:41:39,410
Okay.

8725
06:41:40,690 --> 06:41:41,650
I am...

8726
06:41:41,650 --> 06:41:43,410
I got you.

8727
06:41:43,910 --> 06:41:45,310
I damage boosted you too.

8728
06:41:48,090 --> 06:41:49,390
What the fuck?

8729
06:41:49,710 --> 06:41:50,250
Kill this guy.

8730
06:41:50,410 --> 06:41:50,790
Kill him.

8731
06:41:52,110 --> 06:41:52,610
There you go.

8732
06:41:52,630 --> 06:41:54,430
Get rid of his fucking wood.

8733
06:41:58,330 --> 06:42:00,270
There's a Moon Knight to the right.

8734
06:42:05,020 --> 06:42:06,100
Oh my god, where are you?

8735
06:42:06,220 --> 06:42:07,320
I damage boosted you back.

8736
06:42:10,670 --> 06:42:11,810
I can't see you.

8737
06:42:12,770 --> 06:42:14,610
Yeah, there's still that Moon Knight to my right.

8738
06:42:15,830 --> 06:42:16,470
You got rezzed?

8739
06:42:18,110 --> 06:42:19,430
Oh, the Moon Knight's low.

8740
06:42:19,450 --> 06:42:20,710
No, I'm dead and I'm more, man.

8741
06:42:21,730 --> 06:42:22,130
Nice.

8742
06:42:22,230 --> 06:42:24,090
Our Adam didn't drop a heal when he rezzed me.

8743
06:42:24,750 --> 06:42:25,890
That Psylocke sucks, bro.

8744
06:42:26,090 --> 06:42:27,830
Second chance is over.

8745
06:42:27,830 --> 06:42:29,250
Wait, Grizzlow, Grizzlow!

8746
06:42:30,050 --> 06:42:30,910
I'm back in.

8747
06:42:30,990 --> 06:42:31,210
Okay.

8748
06:42:39,250 --> 06:42:40,650
He's so low, he's so low!

8749
06:42:41,790 --> 06:42:42,230
No!

8750
06:42:44,350 --> 06:42:45,050
Fuck, he's one.

8751
06:42:45,210 --> 06:42:45,750
There we go.

8752
06:42:47,110 --> 06:42:47,750
He's so low.

8753
06:42:49,610 --> 06:42:50,110
No more, no more.

8754
06:42:51,790 --> 06:42:53,210
No, you were so bad!

8755
06:42:53,430 --> 06:42:54,990
You were actually so bad!

8756
06:42:57,750 --> 06:42:58,970
Oh no, oh no.

8757
06:42:58,970 --> 06:42:59,910
Why are you doing that?

8758
06:43:01,190 --> 06:43:01,930
I'm so sad.

8759
06:43:02,510 --> 06:43:03,210
Ow.

8760
06:43:03,570 --> 06:43:05,550
That's fine, we got it.

8761
06:43:06,650 --> 06:43:08,310
I don't think I can turn back.

8762
06:43:11,750 --> 06:43:12,450
That's...

8763
06:43:14,530 --> 06:43:15,530
Oh my gosh.

8764
06:43:15,650 --> 06:43:16,870
It's fine, it's fine.

8765
06:43:17,030 --> 06:43:20,490
We made them waste...

8766
06:43:20,490 --> 06:43:22,150
Manta's up.

8767
06:43:24,510 --> 06:43:25,550
It's okay.

8768
06:43:25,930 --> 06:43:28,510
Everything is okay.

8769
06:43:30,530 --> 06:43:31,630
Two minutes is pretty solid.

8770
06:43:32,530 --> 06:43:33,010
Yeah.

8771
06:43:34,090 --> 06:43:36,650
Our items did, but that's okay, everything is still okay.

8772
06:43:36,650 --> 06:43:37,290
Who's getting fucked?

8773
06:43:38,590 --> 06:43:39,230
Fuck them!

8774
06:43:41,330 --> 06:43:42,710
Is this worth fighting or no?

8775
06:43:43,050 --> 06:43:44,010
For now, I'm up top.

8776
06:43:45,170 --> 06:43:46,230
Okay, it's worth fighting.

8777
06:43:47,470 --> 06:43:48,910
I'm fucking fighting this.

8778
06:43:54,480 --> 06:43:55,540
Raccoon, raccoon, raccoon!

8779
06:43:57,240 --> 06:43:57,720
Okay.

8780
06:43:58,000 --> 06:43:58,660
There we go.

8781
06:43:58,820 --> 06:43:59,440
Penny, penny, penny!

8782
06:43:59,440 --> 06:43:59,800
Penny, penny, penny!

8783
06:44:00,900 --> 06:44:01,780
I got her.

8784
06:44:03,340 --> 06:44:04,220
Oh my god.

8785
06:44:05,780 --> 06:44:07,420
Oh my god, I'm okay.

8786
06:44:08,060 --> 06:44:09,620
I just realized they have Chimes.

8787
06:44:10,280 --> 06:44:10,540
Solo.

8788
06:44:11,180 --> 06:44:11,660
Okay.

8789
06:44:16,440 --> 06:44:17,680
I'm so healthy.

8790
06:44:19,060 --> 06:44:19,580
Kill them all.

8791
06:44:20,940 --> 06:44:22,100
Grid, grid, grid, Ken.

8792
06:44:22,860 --> 06:44:23,940
I'm gonna be on them.

8793
06:44:24,920 --> 06:44:25,400
Okay.

8794
06:44:25,400 --> 06:44:26,120
Okay.

8795
06:44:26,980 --> 06:44:28,360
I damage boosted you.

8796
06:44:29,260 --> 06:44:31,760
I still died, but I'm okay.

8797
06:44:32,040 --> 06:44:32,940
Wait, I...

8798
06:44:32,940 --> 06:44:33,560
Oh, nevermind.

8799
06:44:34,160 --> 06:44:35,040
We're okay.

8800
06:44:36,700 --> 06:44:38,260
We're so okay.

8801
06:44:39,120 --> 06:44:40,740
We're so okay.

8802
06:44:42,400 --> 06:44:47,280
I feel like you're hearing me cut in and out because...

8803
06:44:47,280 --> 06:44:49,540
I hit my F key.

8804
06:44:49,540 --> 06:44:56,570
I hit my F key.

8805
06:44:56,570 --> 06:44:57,610
Oh my god.

8806
06:44:57,830 --> 06:44:58,730
Come on, man.

8807
06:44:59,750 --> 06:45:03,030
Winning this would be my Christmas present.

8808
06:45:14,710 --> 06:45:16,670
At least I'm desperate.

8809
06:45:16,670 --> 06:45:16,850
I'm gonna do it.

8810
06:45:18,450 --> 06:45:21,170
It's gonna be a Doki Christmas miracle.

8811
06:45:25,830 --> 06:45:28,030
Yeah, I probably should change my bind.

8812
06:45:28,330 --> 06:45:29,690
But like...

8813
06:45:29,690 --> 06:45:31,250
The thing is, all the...

8814
06:45:31,250 --> 06:45:33,090
All the fucking...

8815
06:45:33,090 --> 06:45:36,550
Thank you, Ruben and Doki for...

8816
06:45:39,390 --> 06:45:41,050
The thing is...

8817
06:45:41,050 --> 06:45:42,410
F is a key is so close.

8818
06:45:42,530 --> 06:45:45,490
And only Mantis is the only support character.

8819
06:45:46,090 --> 06:45:47,610
Where like, F is a key.

8820
06:45:47,610 --> 06:45:48,710
The thing is...

8821
06:45:48,710 --> 06:45:51,490
The thing about all the keybinds is that...

8822
06:45:51,490 --> 06:45:52,450
They're so...

8823
06:45:52,450 --> 06:45:54,970
The abilities have to be close to each other.

8824
06:45:55,070 --> 06:45:57,610
So it makes sense to be able to like...

8825
06:45:57,610 --> 06:45:58,230
Talk to each other.

8826
06:45:58,510 --> 06:46:01,650
Not talk, but be able to access the buttons.

8827
06:46:02,250 --> 06:46:02,910
So I...

8828
06:46:02,910 --> 06:46:04,330
I didn't know.

8829
06:46:05,450 --> 06:46:06,310
I forgot.

8830
06:46:06,970 --> 06:46:08,350
I don't know what else to do.

8831
06:46:08,790 --> 06:46:11,610
I guess there's cat, but it's not as...

8832
06:46:14,050 --> 06:46:14,530
What?

8833
06:46:14,530 --> 06:46:14,910
What?

8834
06:46:14,910 --> 06:46:16,910
He has open mic too?

8835
06:46:17,110 --> 06:46:18,990
What the fuck is going on?

8836
06:46:18,990 --> 06:46:22,010
That's the Krampus that they were talking about.

8837
06:46:24,130 --> 06:46:27,650
What is going on?

8838
06:46:28,550 --> 06:46:30,710
Are they literally mind-boomed already?

8839
06:46:32,230 --> 06:46:34,250
Oh yeah, he's super boomed.

8840
06:46:34,410 --> 06:46:35,790
Oh my god.

8841
06:46:35,950 --> 06:46:37,230
Like, what happened there?

8842
06:46:38,450 --> 06:46:39,850
How did they mind-boom?

8843
06:46:39,990 --> 06:46:41,550
They literally...

8844
06:46:42,070 --> 06:46:43,030
One minute?

8845
06:46:43,390 --> 06:46:43,770
That's such...

8846
06:46:43,770 --> 06:46:46,610
Honestly, I'd be mind-boomed against us too.

8847
06:46:46,810 --> 06:46:48,430
I mean, it's just kind of hopeless for them.

8848
06:46:48,770 --> 06:46:49,790
How are they supposed to win?

8849
06:46:51,850 --> 06:46:53,150
Oh my god.

8850
06:46:53,250 --> 06:46:54,830
I need to self-heal myself.

8851
06:46:55,010 --> 06:46:55,490
I killed him.

8852
06:46:55,970 --> 06:46:56,910
Nice, thank you.

8853
06:46:57,090 --> 06:47:00,250
How do you mind-boom?

8854
06:47:00,410 --> 06:47:02,290
Like, you have one minute.

8855
06:47:04,890 --> 06:47:06,730
That doesn't make sense.

8856
06:47:08,770 --> 06:47:09,730
It's Christmas.

8857
06:47:10,730 --> 06:47:11,690
It's Christmas?

8858
06:47:12,170 --> 06:47:13,710
Yeah, what the fuck?

8859
06:47:15,050 --> 06:47:16,890
Remember what we said about...

8860
06:47:16,890 --> 06:47:17,450
Oh wait, guys.

8861
06:47:18,350 --> 06:47:20,750
Guys, we're sort of trolling now.

8862
06:47:22,350 --> 06:47:25,770
Guys, if they think they're going to win, they will stop mind-booming.

8863
06:47:26,130 --> 06:47:27,610
We need to keep making sure they have no hope.

8864
06:47:28,570 --> 06:47:30,370
Their Strange really wants me dead.

8865
06:47:30,910 --> 06:47:32,630
I damage boosted you, man.

8866
06:47:33,370 --> 06:47:33,730
I'm alright.

8867
06:47:33,990 --> 06:47:36,930
We need to not give them hope and hope they still feel like shit.

8868
06:47:37,230 --> 06:47:39,050
Holy shit, he got exploded.

8869
06:47:39,230 --> 06:47:39,670
Yeah, he did.

8870
06:47:39,850 --> 06:47:40,850
Yeah, fuck their Christmas up.

8871
06:47:44,530 --> 06:47:46,150
I need this more than them.

8872
06:47:46,370 --> 06:47:49,030
I mean, they're already playing Marvel Rivals and losing.

8873
06:47:49,390 --> 06:47:50,330
How much worse can it be?

8874
06:47:55,290 --> 06:47:56,990
Don't worry, I believe in you guys.

8875
06:48:02,010 --> 06:48:03,750
We gotta make sure they stop trying.

8876
06:48:06,850 --> 06:48:08,050
I can't heal.

8877
06:48:08,590 --> 06:48:09,610
Wait, are you ulting?

8878
06:48:11,470 --> 06:48:12,770
What if I...

8879
06:48:12,770 --> 06:48:17,330
I was gonna say, what if I just hit the nastiest sleep of my life there?

8880
06:48:20,030 --> 06:48:21,590
That shit worked, right?

8881
06:48:22,270 --> 06:48:23,250
Yeah, I got him.

8882
06:48:24,290 --> 06:48:26,570
Oh my god, the defensive Magneto ult.

8883
06:48:26,790 --> 06:48:28,610
What do you want me to do, Sylak?

8884
06:48:28,670 --> 06:48:29,950
Fucking run in and open?

8885
06:48:29,950 --> 06:48:35,390
Dude, the fuck up thing is I hear the I need healing thing and I can't do that.

8886
06:48:35,710 --> 06:48:36,730
That's not in my kit.

8887
06:48:36,870 --> 06:48:39,830
I literally fucking ran in the open for him.

8888
06:48:40,950 --> 06:48:41,990
Sylak trying to flank.

8889
06:48:42,170 --> 06:48:43,230
She's on our backstage.

8890
06:48:44,370 --> 06:48:44,690
Okay.

8891
06:48:44,930 --> 06:48:45,730
She just dropped.

8892
06:48:46,990 --> 06:48:52,710
Okay, before we Q mech, we gotta figure out who to avoid from that team.

8893
06:48:54,110 --> 06:48:56,730
We gotta figure out who the fuck blew the fuck up.

8894
06:48:57,950 --> 06:48:58,770
It's Provy.

8895
06:48:58,930 --> 06:48:59,690
It's Provy?

8896
06:48:59,690 --> 06:49:00,130
Okay.

8897
06:49:00,710 --> 06:49:03,670
Yeah, but then they're saying like somebody refused to swap and stuff.

8898
06:49:05,130 --> 06:49:06,730
Uh, I don't care.

8899
06:49:06,950 --> 06:49:09,730
That guy is the fucking Grinch incarnate.

8900
06:49:09,830 --> 06:49:11,290
I don't want him on my team on Christmas.

8901
06:49:11,630 --> 06:49:13,590
Yeah, but we also don't want someone that doesn't swap.

8902
06:49:18,870 --> 06:49:21,470
You know how it's like, all it takes is one bad day?

8903
06:49:22,750 --> 06:49:25,050
Whoever that didn't swap was his third bad day.

8904
06:49:25,050 --> 06:49:26,930
And like, he was the bad day.

8905
06:49:30,750 --> 06:49:31,310
Sylak?

8906
06:49:33,210 --> 06:49:33,670
Yeah.

8907
06:49:36,050 --> 06:49:36,610
Whoa.

8908
06:49:37,710 --> 06:49:38,270
Whoa.

8909
06:49:39,630 --> 06:49:40,190
Whoa.

8910
06:49:40,570 --> 06:49:42,550
Oh my god, there's a Spider-Man too!

8911
06:49:43,390 --> 06:49:44,210
Oh, that boy's swinging!

8912
06:49:44,390 --> 06:49:45,330
What the fuck?

8913
06:49:45,370 --> 06:49:46,530
When is this team?

8914
06:49:47,750 --> 06:49:49,230
What is going on?

8915
06:49:51,490 --> 06:49:52,930
Yeah, that guy's dead.

8916
06:49:52,930 --> 06:49:53,470
Oh!

8917
06:49:54,530 --> 06:49:54,990
Goodbye.

8918
06:49:56,090 --> 06:49:56,550
Goodbye.

8919
06:49:57,570 --> 06:49:58,030
Goodbye.

8920
06:50:02,710 --> 06:50:03,170
Goodbye.

8921
06:50:04,890 --> 06:50:05,390
Ah, fuck!

8922
06:50:07,270 --> 06:50:08,150
Oh, I'm okay.

8923
06:50:09,110 --> 06:50:09,910
That's okay.

8924
06:50:11,690 --> 06:50:12,310
I have ult.

8925
06:50:12,370 --> 06:50:13,330
I have ult for you.

8926
06:50:13,710 --> 06:50:15,230
I mean, not ult, but damage boost.

8927
06:50:17,670 --> 06:50:19,690
I don't think I should be up here.

8928
06:50:19,870 --> 06:50:20,070
Whoa.

8929
06:50:20,070 --> 06:50:20,230
Oh.

8930
06:50:21,810 --> 06:50:22,350
How?

8931
06:50:24,230 --> 06:50:25,030
How are we?

8932
06:50:25,350 --> 06:50:25,630
Okay.

8933
06:50:26,410 --> 06:50:27,730
Ha, they're all one!

8934
06:50:31,130 --> 06:50:32,930
There's a Spider-Man behind us.

8935
06:50:33,030 --> 06:50:33,610
And a Sylak.

8936
06:50:35,810 --> 06:50:36,350
Wow.

8937
06:50:36,470 --> 06:50:36,750
Wow.

8938
06:50:37,310 --> 06:50:37,950
What a game.

8939
06:50:38,730 --> 06:50:39,730
What a fucking game.

8940
06:50:45,470 --> 06:50:47,290
Worth the loss!

8941
06:50:47,390 --> 06:50:49,030
Wait, they have zero tanks!

8942
06:50:49,590 --> 06:50:50,930
Okay, okay.

8943
06:50:51,190 --> 06:50:56,350
Holy shit, I'm being warned.

8944
06:50:56,370 --> 06:50:56,810
Alright.

8945
06:51:05,030 --> 06:51:13,530
And okay, aFatBiH said, asking a negative DPS to swap to tank is yapping, and the eSymp said, I need to be normal.

8946
06:51:14,490 --> 06:51:17,050
I think this guy might be off the goop.

8947
06:51:17,150 --> 06:51:18,110
A little bit.

8948
06:51:20,030 --> 06:51:22,270
He might be gooping a little too hard.

8949
06:51:22,530 --> 06:51:23,470
Is he okay?

8950
06:51:24,190 --> 06:51:25,790
I don't think so.

8951
06:51:26,550 --> 06:51:28,730
Only a- wait, wait, wait, wait.

8952
06:51:29,630 --> 06:51:30,770
I'm female.

8953
06:51:34,290 --> 06:51:37,830
Alright, I got you.

8954
06:51:37,890 --> 06:51:39,150
I'm getting you good.

8955
06:51:39,930 --> 06:51:44,990
Oh my god, 27% accuracy magnus, only a female can do that!

8956
06:51:45,410 --> 06:51:46,750
You're a good one!

8957
06:51:47,670 --> 06:51:49,850
Holy shit!

8958
06:51:49,850 --> 06:51:50,530
Holy shit!

8959
06:51:50,930 --> 06:51:52,270
What the fuck?

8960
06:51:53,810 --> 06:51:56,550
Dude, look at this guy's record!

8961
06:51:57,610 --> 06:52:00,030
Wait, I didn't, okay, Will's not quoted.

8962
06:52:00,930 --> 06:52:03,070
Did one of you avoid him, or am I avoiding him?

8963
06:52:03,090 --> 06:52:04,070
I avoided him.

8964
06:52:04,990 --> 06:52:09,730
Also, I guess I should have put their masses, like...

8965
06:52:09,730 --> 06:52:12,650
27% is not ideal, not gonna lie, I'm sorry.

8966
06:52:13,330 --> 06:52:15,170
He's 3 and 8 for the day.

8967
06:52:15,910 --> 06:52:20,350
27% is not ideal for your accuracy if you're on that.

8968
06:52:22,490 --> 06:52:23,790
Are you quing it?

8969
06:52:24,250 --> 06:52:27,670
Yeah, I'm looking his stuff up.

8970
06:52:27,830 --> 06:52:29,430
I'm sorry, bro.

8971
06:52:31,510 --> 06:52:31,890
Okay.

8972
06:52:36,470 --> 06:52:40,410
I'm getting reports that he was a classic COD lobby player.

8973
06:52:44,590 --> 06:52:46,950
Bro, no, if you scroll down, he was having a...

8974
06:52:46,950 --> 06:52:48,130
I think it's Christmas.

8975
06:52:48,430 --> 06:52:50,650
I don't think he's okay.

8976
06:52:50,970 --> 06:52:52,530
I think before then he was happy.

8977
06:52:52,750 --> 06:52:55,470
If you scroll down, before then.

8978
06:52:55,550 --> 06:52:56,550
Let me see this.

8979
06:52:56,670 --> 06:53:04,330
Before he was happy, and then he started Christmas queuing, that's when things got hard for him.

8980
06:53:05,750 --> 06:53:08,870
Dude, he gets a natural debuff.

8981
06:53:08,890 --> 06:53:11,290
Why is he practicing versus AI?

8982
06:53:13,550 --> 06:53:18,510
God was real.

8983
06:53:18,790 --> 06:53:19,110
Damn.

8984
06:53:20,810 --> 06:53:21,770
What a name.

8985
06:53:23,030 --> 06:53:23,370
Katamatic.

8986
06:53:25,010 --> 06:53:26,830
Is that the Mercy Katamatic?

8987
06:53:27,010 --> 06:53:29,630
I got this guy on my team the other day.

8988
06:53:30,070 --> 06:53:30,750
Katamatic.

8989
06:53:32,430 --> 06:53:34,070
He's going to be so annoying.

8990
06:53:34,070 --> 06:53:34,370
Okay.

8991
06:53:34,690 --> 06:53:39,750
Do we ban Thor?

8992
06:53:40,850 --> 06:53:41,490
Nah.

8993
06:53:41,950 --> 06:53:43,130
Why would we ban Thor?

8994
06:53:45,470 --> 06:53:47,610
Are we really about to waste a ban on Thor?

8995
06:53:49,270 --> 06:53:49,770
I'm banning Hawkeye.

8996
06:53:49,770 --> 06:53:50,810
Can you play anything else?

8997
06:53:53,030 --> 06:53:54,210
I'll ban Thor.

8998
06:53:54,530 --> 06:53:54,990
Alright.

8999
06:53:55,570 --> 06:53:58,230
We'll do Thor Hawkeye then.

9000
06:53:59,270 --> 06:53:59,910
Okay.

9001
06:54:00,510 --> 06:54:02,070
Cause I'd rather...

9002
06:54:02,070 --> 06:54:03,630
Unless they'll do Hawkeye.

9003
06:54:03,750 --> 06:54:04,670
Do you think they'll do Hawkeye?

9004
06:54:05,190 --> 06:54:05,630
Nah.

9005
06:54:06,130 --> 06:54:07,190
I think they'll do Hawkeye.

9006
06:54:07,690 --> 06:54:08,990
You're really going to bet that?

9007
06:54:10,290 --> 06:54:11,530
I'm a gambling man.

9008
06:54:11,690 --> 06:54:11,990
Okay.

9009
06:54:14,930 --> 06:54:16,650
I'm banning Bruce for you.

9010
06:54:16,970 --> 06:54:18,730
We are not banning Psylocke.

9011
06:54:20,690 --> 06:54:22,890
I'm banning Bruce for you.

9012
06:54:28,390 --> 06:54:30,470
I'm never listening to you again.

9013
06:54:30,470 --> 06:54:35,310
This is my first game with Hawkeye not banned.

9014
06:54:37,150 --> 06:54:39,510
Oh wait, we have one tank.

9015
06:54:39,930 --> 06:54:41,410
Is this even a good Hawkeye map?

9016
06:54:41,550 --> 06:54:41,770
I don't know.

9017
06:54:45,950 --> 06:54:46,830
This is...

9018
06:54:46,830 --> 06:54:48,910
I mean any map is a good Hawkeye map.

9019
06:54:49,070 --> 06:54:50,090
If you believe hard enough.

9020
06:54:51,050 --> 06:54:51,930
Definitely not.

9021
06:54:52,030 --> 06:54:55,050
If you're good enough, any map is a Hawkeye map.

9022
06:54:55,370 --> 06:54:55,810
IMO.

9023
06:54:55,810 --> 06:54:56,390
IMO.

9024
06:54:57,630 --> 06:54:59,790
It's gotta be a really good Hawkeye player.

9025
06:55:03,490 --> 06:55:04,750
That's really it.

9026
06:55:06,050 --> 06:55:07,370
Maybe I'm just an asshole character.

9027
06:55:08,690 --> 06:55:09,050
I'm...

9028
06:55:10,090 --> 06:55:11,750
I'm not saying...

9029
06:55:11,750 --> 06:55:12,850
I'm not...

9030
06:55:14,570 --> 06:55:19,030
I'm just saying every map is a very good Hawkeye map.

9031
06:55:21,790 --> 06:55:23,250
Am I the only...

9032
06:55:23,250 --> 06:55:24,390
I'm the only healer guys.

9033
06:55:24,390 --> 06:55:26,110
Wait, what?

9034
06:55:26,370 --> 06:55:27,230
I'm the only healer.

9035
06:55:28,050 --> 06:55:30,450
And our other tank is Captain America without a Thor.

9036
06:55:35,290 --> 06:55:35,810
Guys...

9037
06:55:35,810 --> 06:55:39,010
Guys, can we have one more healer?

9038
06:55:39,750 --> 06:55:41,330
One more healer.

9039
06:55:44,190 --> 06:55:45,230
Pretty please?

9040
06:55:46,590 --> 06:55:50,770
I still can't get over the fact that the guy was like, you're the only good healer player.

9041
06:55:51,130 --> 06:55:52,110
That shit was so fucking funny.

9042
06:55:52,110 --> 06:55:54,230
I'm going healer instead of Magneto.

9043
06:55:57,910 --> 06:56:00,270
That was the little tank cap though.

9044
06:56:00,450 --> 06:56:03,870
I'm putting it on the Captain America because I feel sick.

9045
06:56:03,890 --> 06:56:04,390
Panther!

9046
06:56:05,430 --> 06:56:06,070
Watch out!

9047
06:56:08,610 --> 06:56:14,110
There's a Panther and Iron Fist and there's a...

9048
06:56:14,910 --> 06:56:15,990
Bro, that...

9049
06:56:15,990 --> 06:56:18,010
I just watched you guys get murdered right before my eyes.

9050
06:56:18,010 --> 06:56:18,830
That shit was scary.

9051
06:56:22,250 --> 06:56:22,730
Yes.

9052
06:56:23,210 --> 06:56:23,690
Yeah.

9053
06:56:26,470 --> 06:56:27,430
I'm scared.

9054
06:56:27,830 --> 06:56:29,830
I don't think this is the game.

9055
06:56:30,430 --> 06:56:34,590
This Panther and Iron Fist are so poorly made.

9056
06:56:38,050 --> 06:56:41,790
I was jumping but I think I was literally jumping into one spot.

9057
06:56:41,930 --> 06:56:42,290
There's a pillar.

9058
06:56:44,810 --> 06:56:45,290
Nice.

9059
06:56:47,870 --> 06:56:48,810
He's so low.

9060
06:56:48,810 --> 06:56:49,970
Wait, who woke him up?

9061
06:56:50,230 --> 06:56:51,770
Who was it?

9062
06:56:52,130 --> 06:56:52,390
Seriously?

9063
06:56:53,970 --> 06:56:56,630
Guys, I'm never listening.

9064
06:56:56,830 --> 06:56:58,650
I'm never letting Mac gamble.

9065
06:57:00,490 --> 06:57:02,730
I'm never letting that happen again.

9066
06:57:04,870 --> 06:57:05,850
That Gru is one!

9067
06:57:05,950 --> 06:57:06,870
That Gru is literally one!

9068
06:57:06,970 --> 06:57:07,730
Okay, thank god.

9069
06:57:07,770 --> 06:57:08,870
I was going to fucking punch somebody.

9070
06:57:14,410 --> 06:57:14,890
Alright.

9071
06:57:15,810 --> 06:57:18,270
I will actually find one of you guys and beat you.

9072
06:57:18,410 --> 06:57:18,830
He's over there.

9073
06:57:18,910 --> 06:57:21,110
Oh my god!

9074
06:57:21,550 --> 06:57:24,930
I saw that Captain America actually run past him.

9075
06:57:29,130 --> 06:57:29,990
Oh, fine.

9076
06:57:30,330 --> 06:57:32,250
We beat you with the friendlier team.

9077
06:57:33,330 --> 06:57:34,710
What the fuck?

9078
06:57:37,250 --> 06:57:39,010
That came out of nowhere.

9079
06:57:39,590 --> 06:57:42,330
Did you start talking shit to her anymore?

9080
06:57:42,990 --> 06:57:43,550
Yeah.

9081
06:57:45,050 --> 06:57:46,630
We slammed you last game.

9082
06:57:46,930 --> 06:57:48,290
You had that friend.

9083
06:57:48,490 --> 06:57:49,250
We slammed you.

9084
06:57:49,630 --> 06:57:50,290
Like, what the fuck?

9085
06:57:50,290 --> 06:57:51,410
That's so real.

9086
06:57:52,830 --> 06:57:56,250
You had a streamer on your team and we fucking beat you up.

9087
06:57:58,010 --> 06:57:59,390
I'm going to ult first, okay?

9088
06:57:59,670 --> 06:58:00,690
I'm just spinning.

9089
06:58:00,970 --> 06:58:01,510
I got slept.

9090
06:58:02,730 --> 06:58:03,330
That's fine.

9091
06:58:05,110 --> 06:58:06,550
Wait, I slept you?

9092
06:58:06,610 --> 06:58:07,770
How the fuck did you ult?

9093
06:58:07,770 --> 06:58:09,770
I'm frozen.

9094
06:58:11,770 --> 06:58:12,250
I'm frozen.

9095
06:58:12,750 --> 06:58:13,750
We're fine.

9096
06:58:13,830 --> 06:58:14,390
We're fine.

9097
06:58:15,090 --> 06:58:18,130
I had damage for one second, but we're okay.

9098
06:58:21,070 --> 06:58:22,150
There's a guy right above.

9099
06:58:22,250 --> 06:58:23,530
There's nearly a Panther.

9100
06:58:23,950 --> 06:58:26,870
I can't save all of you.

9101
06:58:30,630 --> 06:58:31,730
I'm alive.

9102
06:58:33,930 --> 06:58:36,030
They never miss and I'm scared.

9103
06:58:36,030 --> 06:58:37,630
Oh no.

9104
06:58:38,510 --> 06:58:41,910
Yeah, we have no supports though.

9105
06:58:44,270 --> 06:58:46,850
Just peek our Mantis if you can.

9106
06:58:49,350 --> 06:58:51,350
You say you're crazy.

9107
06:58:53,950 --> 06:58:54,770
I'm coming over.

9108
06:58:56,070 --> 06:58:57,050
I'm spinning.

9109
06:58:58,650 --> 06:59:00,570
Bro, get that guy.

9110
06:59:02,970 --> 06:59:07,190
I still can't believe he was like, Hey bro, we fucking owned you.

9111
06:59:07,730 --> 06:59:08,990
And you had that frag.

9112
06:59:09,810 --> 06:59:10,770
That was such a whop.

9113
06:59:12,330 --> 06:59:13,690
This guy just dies.

9114
06:59:15,290 --> 06:59:16,330
Oh shit!

9115
06:59:18,610 --> 06:59:19,570
Oh my god!

9116
06:59:20,590 --> 06:59:21,630
I'm going in their spawn!

9117
06:59:21,830 --> 06:59:22,790
I'm on HP!

9118
06:59:23,150 --> 06:59:23,290
Help!

9119
06:59:24,330 --> 06:59:25,050
I'm helping!

9120
06:59:26,150 --> 06:59:28,350
I basically let them so far away.

9121
06:59:28,390 --> 06:59:29,390
Help Hawkeye!

9122
06:59:34,850 --> 06:59:37,570
I dragged the Iron Fist away from us.

9123
06:59:37,610 --> 06:59:38,770
I did it guys.

9124
06:59:38,830 --> 06:59:41,470
Yeah, you were just fucking booking it.

9125
06:59:43,270 --> 06:59:44,810
I saved us.

9126
06:59:45,050 --> 06:59:47,330
I sacrificed myself just for all of you.

9127
06:59:48,870 --> 06:59:50,690
Because I was fucking terrifying.

9128
06:59:55,390 --> 06:59:58,390
Bro, that was actually...

9129
06:59:58,390 --> 07:00:00,050
Guys, that was so fucking terrifying.

9130
07:00:00,050 --> 07:00:00,490
That was so fucking terrifying, chat.

9131
07:00:02,010 --> 07:00:04,050
I did not deserve that.

9132
07:00:07,910 --> 07:00:08,950
Oh my god.

9133
07:00:11,010 --> 07:00:13,130
Bro, you guys are fucking...

9134
07:00:13,130 --> 07:00:16,010
You guys are spin botting for me.

9135
07:00:18,210 --> 07:00:19,890
Gotta lay off on the Adderall, please.

9136
07:00:25,220 --> 07:00:25,740
I have 3M.

9137
07:00:26,560 --> 07:00:27,680
Oh shit.

9138
07:00:28,140 --> 07:00:30,820
That's fine, we better win this then.

9139
07:00:31,400 --> 07:00:33,780
If we don't win this, I'll be so very sad.

9140
07:00:33,780 --> 07:00:33,980
I want that Black Panther dead.

9141
07:00:34,800 --> 07:00:38,560
I'm gonna go save our Captain America and I'm coming back.

9142
07:00:38,740 --> 07:00:39,600
Solid one on the left.

9143
07:00:43,610 --> 07:00:44,670
Oh my god.

9144
07:00:46,250 --> 07:00:47,170
Please, Magneto.

9145
07:00:47,590 --> 07:00:48,810
Please, I'm gonna beat him up.

9146
07:00:49,310 --> 07:00:52,870
Alright, we better win this with the double support ult that we just did.

9147
07:00:53,610 --> 07:00:55,110
I can freeze anyone on the left side.

9148
07:00:55,550 --> 07:00:55,810
Panther.

9149
07:00:56,050 --> 07:00:57,250
Nevermind, it's Panther.

9150
07:00:59,410 --> 07:01:00,130
I killed him.

9151
07:01:00,130 --> 07:01:00,410
Nice.

9152
07:01:02,330 --> 07:01:03,690
We gotta just focus.

9153
07:01:05,090 --> 07:01:05,810
Oh, nevermind.

9154
07:01:07,910 --> 07:01:09,370
This might be where I die?

9155
07:01:11,070 --> 07:01:11,430
Yeah.

9156
07:01:15,290 --> 07:01:16,290
We can still win this.

9157
07:01:16,410 --> 07:01:17,030
We can still win this.

9158
07:01:17,150 --> 07:01:17,850
You're up one.

9159
07:01:20,170 --> 07:01:21,250
Yes, you can still win this.

9160
07:01:21,250 --> 07:01:21,730
This is Starlord.

9161
07:01:24,250 --> 07:01:25,470
You know what, you're right.

9162
07:01:25,510 --> 07:01:26,090
We took the gamble.

9163
07:01:26,210 --> 07:01:27,110
We had the better Hawkeye.

9164
07:01:27,110 --> 07:01:28,850
Yup, exactly.

9165
07:01:29,250 --> 07:01:29,710
Bye guys.

9166
07:01:29,810 --> 07:01:31,830
Even when I lose, I win.

9167
07:01:34,330 --> 07:01:35,630
We took the Hawkeye.

9168
07:01:35,770 --> 07:01:37,470
We took the Hawkeye dip.

9169
07:01:39,790 --> 07:01:41,470
Should we BM and match chat?

9170
07:01:41,650 --> 07:01:41,810
No.

9171
07:01:44,970 --> 07:01:47,510
Karma will get us if we do that.

9172
07:01:47,590 --> 07:01:49,150
Do you guys want to ban Hawkeye now?

9173
07:01:49,710 --> 07:01:51,650
No, I 100% Yes, fucking crazy.

9174
07:01:53,730 --> 07:01:55,330
We never have a chance.

9175
07:01:55,330 --> 07:01:56,330
It's lucky we're good.

9176
07:01:56,510 --> 07:01:58,090
I think we're just absolutely destroying them.

9177
07:01:58,370 --> 07:02:05,410
Oh my god.

9178
07:02:10,150 --> 07:02:15,350
Chat, I'm not willing to take the gamble of whichever team has the better Hawkeye.

9179
07:02:15,470 --> 07:02:16,910
It's actually so fucking frustrating.

9180
07:02:17,430 --> 07:02:24,650
If a team has the worst Hawkeye, it's so frustrating to play as when you have the worst Hawkeye because you can't do anything about it.

9181
07:02:24,950 --> 07:02:26,410
You literally can't do anything about it.

9182
07:02:26,410 --> 07:02:28,730
You have to watch your Hawkeye get fucking destroyed.

9183
07:02:29,890 --> 07:02:30,690
And lose.

9184
07:02:34,450 --> 07:02:36,450
It's not worth it.

9185
07:02:36,630 --> 07:02:40,550
Yeah, you might get the better Hawkeye, but 99% of the time, you do not.

9186
07:02:42,450 --> 07:02:43,270
It's just not fun.

9187
07:02:43,410 --> 07:02:46,350
It's not fun at all when you get absolutely destroyed by a better Hawkeye.

9188
07:03:00,370 --> 07:03:01,330
It's fine.

9189
07:03:01,510 --> 07:03:02,050
It's fine.

9190
07:03:04,870 --> 07:03:05,590
Play slow.

9191
07:03:05,670 --> 07:03:06,750
You don't have Mantis yet.

9192
07:03:09,570 --> 07:03:10,050
Alright.

9193
07:03:10,370 --> 07:03:11,210
They have a Venom.

9194
07:03:11,870 --> 07:03:12,610
Alright, I'm back.

9195
07:03:13,530 --> 07:03:15,970
I don't know where he's trying to land on, but he's there.

9196
07:03:16,530 --> 07:03:17,790
I'm not sure, but that dude was swinging.

9197
07:03:18,790 --> 07:03:21,090
Yeah, he swung somewhere.

9198
07:03:21,090 --> 07:03:22,870
He fucking swung!

9199
07:03:23,130 --> 07:03:26,950
I don't like how we're giving them so much free space.

9200
07:03:27,070 --> 07:03:27,890
It's actually crazy.

9201
07:03:28,130 --> 07:03:28,290
Venom!

9202
07:03:30,210 --> 07:03:32,110
19 inches of Venom, cut!

9203
07:03:33,770 --> 07:03:34,810
Oh god!

9204
07:03:34,990 --> 07:03:36,210
Hey, can you...

9205
07:03:36,210 --> 07:03:36,570
Please!

9206
07:03:37,310 --> 07:03:40,190
I was healing you as much as I could.

9207
07:03:40,450 --> 07:03:41,290
Yeah, I know.

9208
07:03:42,110 --> 07:03:43,890
It's just not great.

9209
07:03:43,890 --> 07:03:43,930
Alright.

9210
07:03:43,930 --> 07:03:43,930
Alright,

9211
07:03:46,950 --> 07:03:49,710
I'm coming back.

9212
07:03:50,230 --> 07:03:51,650
19 inches of Venom back.

9213
07:03:52,990 --> 07:03:53,650
Venom!

9214
07:03:54,030 --> 07:03:55,630
Oh, you're all dead.

9215
07:03:56,590 --> 07:03:56,770
Oh.

9216
07:04:02,460 --> 07:04:03,780
I hear...

9217
07:04:04,350 --> 07:04:04,680
Yeah.

9218
07:04:05,420 --> 07:04:07,040
Yeah, I heard him.

9219
07:04:07,860 --> 07:04:08,800
Oh my god!

9220
07:04:08,800 --> 07:04:10,380
I killed one Flanker first!

9221
07:04:10,480 --> 07:04:11,100
Oh my god.

9222
07:04:11,360 --> 07:04:12,660
Watch out.

9223
07:04:12,980 --> 07:04:13,720
Nuked by Venom.

9224
07:04:15,200 --> 07:04:16,600
Yeah, this...

9225
07:04:16,600 --> 07:04:20,720
This comp might not be ideal for two Flankers.

9226
07:04:27,740 --> 07:04:30,060
Yeah, they have double tanks.

9227
07:04:37,520 --> 07:04:38,640
Venom's one.

9228
07:04:38,760 --> 07:04:39,480
Venom's one.

9229
07:04:40,400 --> 07:04:42,800
Venom has no... Oh my god!

9230
07:04:42,800 --> 07:04:44,880
The Black Panther gets shielded!

9231
07:04:47,380 --> 07:04:48,800
And my Ashley...

9232
07:04:52,040 --> 07:04:53,400
Alright, I'm coming back.

9233
07:04:54,020 --> 07:04:55,660
We're manned in solo, so don't take too much damage.

9234
07:04:57,340 --> 07:04:57,960
Alright, I'll spin.

9235
07:04:58,180 --> 07:04:58,720
Walk above that.

9236
07:04:59,800 --> 07:05:01,440
I got the Luna ult.

9237
07:05:03,100 --> 07:05:04,260
I'm gonna break his ult.

9238
07:05:04,420 --> 07:05:04,860
I broke it.

9239
07:05:05,420 --> 07:05:05,840
Nice.

9240
07:05:09,700 --> 07:05:10,720
They used Luna ult.

9241
07:05:11,460 --> 07:05:14,140
Guys, the Venom is...

9242
07:05:14,140 --> 07:05:15,060
I'm looking for it.

9243
07:05:15,400 --> 07:05:16,600
Oh my god.

9244
07:05:17,520 --> 07:05:19,320
Oh, I should have ulted that.

9245
07:05:20,120 --> 07:05:21,260
That was pretty huge.

9246
07:05:21,600 --> 07:05:23,720
I didn't think, like...

9247
07:05:28,040 --> 07:05:29,640
I should not have done that.

9248
07:05:29,800 --> 07:05:31,340
I thought we were gonna lose that fight.

9249
07:05:31,340 --> 07:05:31,820
Nah, that's fine.

9250
07:05:31,860 --> 07:05:32,900
I'm close to Mantis ult.

9251
07:05:33,600 --> 07:05:33,880
Alright.

9252
07:05:35,140 --> 07:05:36,260
I get those.

9253
07:05:37,700 --> 07:05:39,220
Oh my god, Hawkeye, please.

9254
07:05:39,220 --> 07:05:40,620
I just need you to diff everybody.

9255
07:05:40,860 --> 07:05:42,300
You're, like, literally our carry.

9256
07:05:51,700 --> 07:05:54,180
Oh my god, he has no more shields.

9257
07:05:54,820 --> 07:05:56,260
Oh, there's the...

9258
07:05:56,260 --> 07:05:57,800
Oh my god, okay.

9259
07:05:58,140 --> 07:05:59,320
I'm fucking leaving now.

9260
07:06:02,520 --> 07:06:05,080
No, not the building collapse behind me.

9261
07:06:05,600 --> 07:06:07,520
I hate that mechanic.

9262
07:06:09,220 --> 07:06:10,040
Oh my god.

9263
07:06:10,460 --> 07:06:11,420
Good luck, everybody.

9264
07:06:12,260 --> 07:06:12,940
Good luck.

9265
07:06:14,520 --> 07:06:15,920
He is not low.

9266
07:06:17,300 --> 07:06:19,100
Someone shot him while he was shielding.

9267
07:06:20,060 --> 07:06:21,560
It could have been me.

9268
07:06:22,260 --> 07:06:23,320
It could have been me.

9269
07:06:23,460 --> 07:06:26,100
I fucking just shoot when things are getting bad.

9270
07:06:31,210 --> 07:06:33,930
No, I think we do need a second tank.

9271
07:06:37,570 --> 07:06:39,370
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

9272
07:06:41,690 --> 07:06:44,050
I'm going in as a support and then I run back.

9273
07:06:45,750 --> 07:06:46,270
Nice.

9274
07:06:46,690 --> 07:06:48,310
Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna.

9275
07:06:49,050 --> 07:06:49,570
Please.

9276
07:06:50,910 --> 07:06:52,010
Oh my god.

9277
07:06:52,430 --> 07:06:53,830
I'm going back on the point.

9278
07:06:57,730 --> 07:06:58,250
Nice.

9279
07:07:00,810 --> 07:07:01,330
Please.

9280
07:07:04,350 --> 07:07:04,790
Oh my god.

9281
07:07:04,890 --> 07:07:06,570
Venoms, I just won.

9282
07:07:07,490 --> 07:07:08,530
Oh no.

9283
07:07:09,050 --> 07:07:10,630
It was so low.

9284
07:07:17,150 --> 07:07:17,650
Yeah.

9285
07:07:19,210 --> 07:07:20,610
I have champs in January.

9286
07:07:25,090 --> 07:07:26,150
Free agent team.

9287
07:07:28,470 --> 07:07:29,230
Hell yeah.

9288
07:07:30,190 --> 07:07:31,830
Hell yeah, no money, let's go.

9289
07:07:31,850 --> 07:07:34,050
I don't think that's a hell yeah type of thing.

9290
07:07:35,490 --> 07:07:37,250
I don't think he knows what that means.

9291
07:07:40,070 --> 07:07:40,630
Ow.

9292
07:07:41,070 --> 07:07:42,270
I'm stuck on the payload.

9293
07:07:47,030 --> 07:07:47,890
I'm fine.

9294
07:07:48,390 --> 07:07:49,190
I'm not fine.

9295
07:07:51,490 --> 07:07:53,650
I'm standing behind so I can't...

9296
07:07:55,810 --> 07:07:56,890
No, I got froze.

9297
07:07:58,070 --> 07:08:01,530
I have to leave here now.

9298
07:08:01,630 --> 07:08:02,270
Luna can die.

9299
07:08:02,410 --> 07:08:02,630
I slept.

9300
07:08:07,240 --> 07:08:09,040
It's just a Captain America.

9301
07:08:09,040 --> 07:08:11,220
If you can peek me, I...

9302
07:08:11,220 --> 07:08:12,480
I'm cooked.

9303
07:08:12,720 --> 07:08:13,720
I'm out of boosters.

9304
07:08:14,120 --> 07:08:15,300
Alright, we won.

9305
07:08:15,720 --> 07:08:17,460
We won or you're going to die.

9306
07:08:19,480 --> 07:08:23,520
I don't think anyone wants to swap except...

9307
07:08:23,520 --> 07:08:24,400
I'll go Penny.

9308
07:08:25,000 --> 07:08:25,620
Fuck it.

9309
07:08:33,860 --> 07:08:35,420
Alright, we're going to go Penny.

9310
07:08:35,500 --> 07:08:36,660
I'll put my orb on.

9311
07:08:37,120 --> 07:08:41,340
Oh yeah, that's right.

9312
07:08:41,340 --> 07:08:43,420
I can play around on mines.

9313
07:08:43,960 --> 07:08:45,240
And he'll blow up.

9314
07:08:46,540 --> 07:08:47,140
Oh my god.

9315
07:08:47,340 --> 07:08:48,280
Thank god.

9316
07:08:49,040 --> 07:08:49,520
W.

9317
07:08:50,660 --> 07:08:53,200
Oh my god, this is a pick.

9318
07:08:53,500 --> 07:08:53,840
This is...

9319
07:08:53,840 --> 07:08:54,340
Magnio.

9320
07:08:56,580 --> 07:08:58,400
That's right, they can't do shit now.

9321
07:09:00,060 --> 07:09:00,920
Oh my god, it's just win.

9322
07:09:01,900 --> 07:09:02,380
Venom?

9323
07:09:06,760 --> 07:09:08,340
Oh my god, guys.

9324
07:09:08,340 --> 07:09:09,380
This is it.

9325
07:09:10,700 --> 07:09:13,240
Yeah, W swap.

9326
07:09:15,220 --> 07:09:16,520
This is two fights.

9327
07:09:19,260 --> 07:09:19,760
Where's your mines?

9328
07:09:20,580 --> 07:09:21,580
I'm going to stand next to them.

9329
07:09:22,920 --> 07:09:22,940
Yeah.

9330
07:09:23,960 --> 07:09:24,480
Panther?

9331
07:09:26,220 --> 07:09:26,740
Pyro.

9332
07:09:27,640 --> 07:09:29,160
I got a squid on you.

9333
07:09:31,400 --> 07:09:33,300
What is that, Captain America?

9334
07:09:33,600 --> 07:09:35,540
I'm keeping you alive.

9335
07:09:35,540 --> 07:09:36,780
Because you have the mines.

9336
07:09:38,720 --> 07:09:39,660
He's hitting my mines.

9337
07:09:42,780 --> 07:09:43,180
Groot.

9338
07:09:43,600 --> 07:09:44,460
Groot's eating mines.

9339
07:09:44,740 --> 07:09:45,240
I'm going to ult here.

9340
07:09:47,260 --> 07:09:48,220
Yo, they're low.

9341
07:09:49,720 --> 07:09:50,740
You meant his ult first.

9342
07:09:50,900 --> 07:09:51,540
Oh, fuck.

9343
07:09:53,240 --> 07:09:54,300
That's why, yeah.

9344
07:09:55,120 --> 07:09:55,980
I didn't have it.

9345
07:09:57,620 --> 07:09:58,440
They used Luna.

9346
07:09:58,560 --> 07:09:59,380
Oh, their Penny's low.

9347
07:09:59,540 --> 07:10:00,000
Okay, that's good.

9348
07:10:02,300 --> 07:10:03,100
I have...

9349
07:10:03,100 --> 07:10:06,420
I can ult here if you all live.

9350
07:10:07,040 --> 07:10:08,100
What the hell?

9351
07:10:09,460 --> 07:10:10,360
Can you walk up?

9352
07:10:12,580 --> 07:10:17,130
Can you keep me up?

9353
07:10:18,510 --> 07:10:19,950
Oh my god.

9354
07:10:19,970 --> 07:10:21,710
I have to use this or I'll die.

9355
07:10:23,130 --> 07:10:23,830
He's one.

9356
07:10:24,250 --> 07:10:26,750
We can make this last fight.

9357
07:10:31,020 --> 07:10:32,300
Oh, damn.

9358
07:10:34,040 --> 07:10:36,220
He ulted me the moment I got up.

9359
07:10:36,540 --> 07:10:37,580
Oh, that's crazy.

9360
07:10:42,360 --> 07:10:44,300
I have to heal our Hawkeye.

9361
07:10:46,100 --> 07:10:46,980
Hawkeye, please.

9362
07:10:47,720 --> 07:10:48,760
You're stressing me out.

9363
07:10:54,100 --> 07:10:55,160
I'm on it.

9364
07:10:55,940 --> 07:10:57,120
I'm on it, but I die.

9365
07:10:58,840 --> 07:11:00,040
I die for it, though.

9366
07:11:00,040 --> 07:11:03,500
They had Mantis ult, too.

9367
07:11:10,200 --> 07:11:12,480
Oh my god.

9368
07:11:25,100 --> 07:11:26,060
I fucking...

9369
07:11:26,060 --> 07:11:27,940
Now I wanna...

9370
07:11:27,940 --> 07:11:31,100
Other Luna, how much heals you have?

9371
07:11:31,260 --> 07:11:33,040
The fuck is he comparing dick sizes?

9372
07:11:33,580 --> 07:11:35,380
That's what I say!

9373
07:11:36,860 --> 07:11:40,440
Dude, there's so many dick measures in this game.

9374
07:11:40,660 --> 07:11:44,060
How much heals I have?

9375
07:11:44,280 --> 07:11:46,440
Just wait until the end of the game.

9376
07:11:47,680 --> 07:11:49,360
You had two tanks.

9377
07:11:49,500 --> 07:11:53,080
I had one for like 80% of that game.

9378
07:11:54,040 --> 07:11:54,480
Like...

9379
07:11:55,800 --> 07:11:58,420
No fucking wonder you have more heals than me.

9380
07:11:59,620 --> 07:12:02,420
You have a venom that feeds out of his fucking mind.

9381
07:12:02,620 --> 07:12:04,160
And you just put an orb on him.

9382
07:12:04,840 --> 07:12:06,080
Yeah, how many heals do you have?

9383
07:12:06,200 --> 07:12:07,060
I have 22k.

9384
07:12:09,560 --> 07:12:10,480
Wait, Ruben.

9385
07:12:11,460 --> 07:12:12,340
Wait, Ruben.

9386
07:12:12,740 --> 07:12:13,440
Oh, dude.

9387
07:12:15,060 --> 07:12:15,500
14k?

9388
07:12:15,620 --> 07:12:16,300
Okay, I'm healing.

9389
07:12:23,080 --> 07:12:26,240
Okay, we gotta break the penny traps then.

9390
07:12:27,760 --> 07:12:29,160
Unless... Wait, actually, they're playing...

9391
07:12:29,160 --> 07:12:31,600
There's no way they play Penny on attack for this point, right?

9392
07:12:33,600 --> 07:12:35,940
That's fucking stupid, but it can work for them.

9393
07:12:42,180 --> 07:12:44,080
Are they playing Penny or not?

9394
07:12:45,220 --> 07:12:45,840
Yeah, they are.

9395
07:12:47,440 --> 07:12:48,700
They're playing Penny and Groot.

9396
07:12:51,060 --> 07:12:53,980
Okay, my frames are a lot better this round, so we win.

9397
07:12:54,400 --> 07:12:54,960
Nice.

9398
07:12:56,460 --> 07:12:57,580
I can't...

9399
07:12:57,580 --> 07:12:59,420
We can't heal Captain America here.

9400
07:13:01,000 --> 07:13:01,480
Nice.

9401
07:13:03,700 --> 07:13:05,920
I'm gonna go for a stun on Cloaker.

9402
07:13:06,480 --> 07:13:06,840
Close stun.

9403
07:13:07,300 --> 07:13:08,440
Aw, thank you.

9404
07:13:09,760 --> 07:13:11,360
One last fight, one last fight.

9405
07:13:11,480 --> 07:13:11,940
We got...

9406
07:13:11,940 --> 07:13:14,580
Oh, Captain America, you're fucking crazy!

9407
07:13:15,540 --> 07:13:16,660
Just like America.

9408
07:13:21,410 --> 07:13:22,530
Okay, we're fine.

9409
07:13:25,630 --> 07:13:27,790
I've got the mines, like, fucking wrapping the corner.

9410
07:13:28,090 --> 07:13:28,990
Kill Groot, kill Groot, kill Groot.

9411
07:13:29,970 --> 07:13:30,870
Groot's stunned, Groot's stunned.

9412
07:13:32,010 --> 07:13:32,690
Wait, I'm gonna die.

9413
07:13:33,690 --> 07:13:34,310
No, you're not.

9414
07:13:34,950 --> 07:13:35,290
Penny won.

9415
07:13:39,040 --> 07:13:40,220
Penny won, Penny won, Penny won.

9416
07:13:40,560 --> 07:13:40,920
I'm ulting.

9417
07:13:41,580 --> 07:13:42,820
Penny's still...

9418
07:13:45,180 --> 07:13:46,840
I'm trying to not give them any more scores.

9419
07:13:47,480 --> 07:13:48,460
Okay, I'm backing up.

9420
07:13:51,820 --> 07:13:52,640
I can't reload.

9421
07:13:54,160 --> 07:13:54,980
I have ult.

9422
07:13:56,240 --> 07:13:56,960
I got stun.

9423
07:13:59,800 --> 07:14:01,040
I have to...

9424
07:14:01,040 --> 07:14:03,500
We Luna and then we...

9425
07:14:04,100 --> 07:14:05,440
And then Mantis later.

9426
07:14:06,020 --> 07:14:07,120
Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna dead.

9427
07:14:08,400 --> 07:14:09,920
Groot, focus Groot, focus Groot.

9428
07:14:09,940 --> 07:14:11,980
Focus Groot, focus Groot, I'm on heals.

9429
07:14:12,340 --> 07:14:13,400
I'm on my...

9430
07:14:13,400 --> 07:14:14,100
Penny next.

9431
07:14:14,600 --> 07:14:15,740
Actually, Cloak, Cloak, Cloak stun.

9432
07:14:15,760 --> 07:14:16,860
Cloak, Cloak, Cloak, and then Penny.

9433
07:14:17,480 --> 07:14:18,740
Get her out, get her out.

9434
07:14:20,720 --> 07:14:21,780
Never miss.

9435
07:14:22,600 --> 07:14:22,940
Nice.

9436
07:14:24,480 --> 07:14:25,480
We're so...

9437
07:14:25,480 --> 07:14:27,560
We're so good at this game.

9438
07:14:29,060 --> 07:14:31,400
Guys, I feel like I've never tried this hard before.

9439
07:14:31,540 --> 07:14:32,380
I'm nearly calming.

9440
07:14:32,680 --> 07:14:34,800
Look at their supports versus us.

9441
07:14:34,860 --> 07:14:36,140
I'm nearly calming.

9442
07:14:36,220 --> 07:14:36,900
What bums.

9443
07:14:37,480 --> 07:14:39,020
Calling focus.

9444
07:14:39,640 --> 07:14:40,640
Oh my god.

9445
07:14:40,740 --> 07:14:41,900
We're just so talented.

9446
07:14:42,340 --> 07:14:44,040
Merry Christmas, it's 5am.

9447
07:14:44,040 --> 07:14:44,260
It's 5am.

9448
07:14:47,560 --> 07:14:49,420
Don't gotta tell me twice.

9449
07:14:50,120 --> 07:14:51,460
Merry Christmas.

9450
07:14:59,880 --> 07:15:09,320
I really don't know how much this really matters now.

9451
07:15:14,040 --> 07:15:14,420
Yay.

9452
07:15:16,680 --> 07:15:19,240
Hey, 50% accuracy, I'll take it.

9453
07:15:20,540 --> 07:15:22,960
I'm like, starting to get better at headshots.

9454
07:15:23,180 --> 07:15:31,980
Because like, I got trained to do body shots for Apex, so like I'm not used to at all doing like, headshots.

9455
07:15:33,980 --> 07:15:35,900
You have to completely readjust.

9456
07:15:36,140 --> 07:15:36,500
Yeah.

9457
07:15:36,740 --> 07:15:40,400
So imagine like, you were probably good at headshotting before if you played Overwatch.

9458
07:15:40,800 --> 07:15:41,660
Yeah, yeah.

9459
07:15:41,660 --> 07:15:48,600
And then I readjusted my aim to like, body, like just having it center body for Apex.

9460
07:15:48,840 --> 07:15:52,520
And now I have to readjust to headshots again, which is freaking hard.

9461
07:15:53,420 --> 07:15:59,000
The annoying thing about this game is I do it a lot of times I'll aim at the head and it'll be a body shot.

9462
07:15:59,060 --> 07:16:00,020
It's the offset.

9463
07:16:00,560 --> 07:16:01,420
The crosshair offset.

9464
07:16:02,620 --> 07:16:04,200
And also mouse access.

9465
07:16:04,540 --> 07:16:07,180
I'm getting fucking ran at by a Panther.

9466
07:16:07,640 --> 07:16:08,200
You're fine.

9467
07:16:09,500 --> 07:16:10,640
He's on me again.

9468
07:16:10,940 --> 07:16:11,660
I'm dead.

9469
07:16:13,380 --> 07:16:14,440
You're fine.

9470
07:16:14,760 --> 07:16:15,880
You're so fine.

9471
07:16:19,680 --> 07:16:20,260
Fundy.

9472
07:16:20,640 --> 07:16:22,540
You're scaring me, Fundy.

9473
07:16:23,540 --> 07:16:25,220
I'm just gonna stare at this Panther.

9474
07:16:25,700 --> 07:16:27,140
Can you peek me so I can damage you?

9475
07:16:27,500 --> 07:16:28,760
Yep, there we go.

9476
07:16:30,140 --> 07:16:31,620
I'm just staring at the Panther.

9477
07:16:33,840 --> 07:16:36,320
I just wanna Captain America fucking die.

9478
07:16:37,540 --> 07:16:38,720
Oh my god!

9479
07:16:44,660 --> 07:16:45,680
Magneto, please.

9480
07:16:45,840 --> 07:16:47,140
He's just frontlining everything.

9481
07:16:50,420 --> 07:16:51,960
Oh my god.

9482
07:16:57,760 --> 07:16:59,280
I can...

9483
07:16:59,280 --> 07:17:01,580
We can force this if we have to.

9484
07:17:02,480 --> 07:17:03,580
I'm forcing this.

9485
07:17:08,530 --> 07:17:08,970
Alright.

9486
07:17:09,330 --> 07:17:10,030
I got you.

9487
07:17:10,570 --> 07:17:11,230
Black Panther behind.

9488
07:17:12,810 --> 07:17:13,250
Hawkeye one.

9489
07:17:13,350 --> 07:17:13,770
Hawkeye one.

9490
07:17:14,070 --> 07:17:15,730
No way you headshot me while I'm spinning.

9491
07:17:15,850 --> 07:17:16,590
We got Penny.

9492
07:17:16,830 --> 07:17:17,650
There's no mines.

9493
07:17:18,090 --> 07:17:19,190
We're fucking free!

9494
07:17:19,650 --> 07:17:20,390
We're free!

9495
07:17:22,170 --> 07:17:22,850
Oh shit!

9496
07:17:24,350 --> 07:17:25,070
Okay, thank you.

9497
07:17:25,570 --> 07:17:26,750
I'm ulting as soon as I get it.

9498
07:17:27,630 --> 07:17:28,650
We need to get rid of Penny.

9499
07:17:31,390 --> 07:17:32,690
I'm very free.

9500
07:17:33,490 --> 07:17:34,630
I have no more mines.

9501
07:17:40,810 --> 07:17:41,810
Too easy.

9502
07:17:43,370 --> 07:17:45,210
No Penny, let's go!

9503
07:17:45,610 --> 07:17:46,210
USA!

9504
07:17:47,070 --> 07:17:47,670
USA!

9505
07:17:50,230 --> 07:17:52,510
That's what they get for not banning Hawkeye.

9506
07:17:52,590 --> 07:17:54,990
That guy has 41k.

9507
07:17:55,090 --> 07:17:56,070
Jesus Christ.

9508
07:17:57,070 --> 07:17:58,990
Oh my god, you're back!

9509
07:17:59,430 --> 07:18:00,950
I need one more win.

9510
07:18:01,750 --> 07:18:02,910
I need one more win.

9511
07:18:03,510 --> 07:18:04,550
And then I'll be...

9512
07:18:04,550 --> 07:18:06,490
I'll be up, I think.

9513
07:18:06,530 --> 07:18:07,050
I'll be up again.

9514
07:18:07,050 --> 07:18:09,450
I think we get eternity tonight.

9515
07:18:09,670 --> 07:18:10,350
Okay.

9516
07:18:14,610 --> 07:18:20,650
Love it when we don't ban Hawkeye and I'm the one with a shitty Hawkeye player.

9517
07:18:21,550 --> 07:18:23,610
Now they know how I feel.

9518
07:18:26,850 --> 07:18:28,510
Poor guy did what he could.

9519
07:18:29,030 --> 07:18:31,070
He had 19 deaths.

9520
07:18:31,210 --> 07:18:32,090
That's crazy.

9521
07:18:32,930 --> 07:18:34,110
Wait, BP?

9522
07:18:35,290 --> 07:18:36,010
BP?

9523
07:18:36,010 --> 07:18:36,390
Black Panther.

9524
07:18:36,630 --> 07:18:37,430
Oh, Black Panther.

9525
07:18:38,010 --> 07:18:45,470
Oh my god, you guys all our DPS were farming.

9526
07:18:47,210 --> 07:18:52,970
How the fuck did we struggle that much with that amount of kills?

9527
07:18:55,950 --> 07:18:58,690
Oh, it's like the same team.

9528
07:18:59,050 --> 07:19:00,470
They got Fungie now.

9529
07:19:01,330 --> 07:19:03,930
Wait, was Fungie on our team or last game?

9530
07:19:03,970 --> 07:19:05,410
No, we played with him.

9531
07:19:05,950 --> 07:19:06,630
Oh, Deathcook.

9532
07:19:07,090 --> 07:19:08,290
I'll be Mantis then.

9533
07:19:11,270 --> 07:19:12,630
See, I don't have an ego.

9534
07:19:12,970 --> 07:19:15,290
I'm willing to give this one trick to one trick.

9535
07:19:15,290 --> 07:19:16,630
I'm sorry, man.

9536
07:19:17,050 --> 07:19:22,910
He had 12k damage.

9537
07:19:23,610 --> 07:19:26,330
We are not banning Black Panther, bro.

9538
07:19:29,390 --> 07:19:30,670
We're banning...

9539
07:19:30,670 --> 07:19:33,210
No, we are not banning Black Panther!

9540
07:19:33,930 --> 07:19:35,190
Oh, thank god.

9541
07:19:37,170 --> 07:19:39,490
Okay, do we get Hella?

9542
07:19:39,950 --> 07:19:41,230
I don't know if they're gonna do Hella.

9543
07:19:45,290 --> 07:19:47,490
You're gonna be the one guy that got Hulk.

9544
07:19:47,670 --> 07:19:49,410
You're gonna be that 20%.

9545
07:19:53,290 --> 07:19:55,790
Do you believe in yourself enough?

9546
07:19:56,750 --> 07:19:58,550
I just don't fuck with Hulk players.

9547
07:20:00,290 --> 07:20:00,810
No more.

9548
07:20:07,050 --> 07:20:08,670
Jarvis got Hella.

9549
07:20:10,370 --> 07:20:11,110
Thank god.

9550
07:20:11,570 --> 07:20:11,790
No.

9551
07:20:12,890 --> 07:20:13,830
Hawkeye bullshit.

9552
07:20:25,390 --> 07:20:26,270
That's crazy.

9553
07:20:26,670 --> 07:20:28,130
Oh, we got Thor one trick.

9554
07:20:31,310 --> 07:20:32,150
Then we'll get Howard.

9555
07:20:32,370 --> 07:20:34,370
Honestly, I won't be surprised if Howard the Duck is in Marvel.

9556
07:20:34,670 --> 07:20:38,890
I looked at NetEase games when the stuff they did...

9557
07:20:38,890 --> 07:20:40,830
This is not their first Marvel games.

9558
07:20:40,930 --> 07:20:42,710
This is literally their third Marvel game.

9559
07:20:43,170 --> 07:20:43,990
I'm glad they...

9560
07:20:43,990 --> 07:20:51,370
The other two Marvel games they made, the 3D models they used was like not the...

9561
07:20:51,370 --> 07:20:54,850
It was more realistic Marvel realistic models.

9562
07:20:55,190 --> 07:21:02,570
So I'm really happy they went with a more cartoony comic book style for this one because it definitely works a lot more.

9563
07:21:05,350 --> 07:21:08,710
It's such an improvement from their other Marvel games.

9564
07:21:09,390 --> 07:21:11,570
Yeah, the stylized shit is so much better.

9565
07:21:17,690 --> 07:21:23,150
Alright guys, get ready for me being muted unmuted.

9566
07:21:27,010 --> 07:21:30,610
Get ready for the best Captain America gameplay you've ever seen in your life.

9567
07:21:39,830 --> 07:21:40,770
Oh, nice.

9568
07:21:40,790 --> 07:21:40,810
Oh, nice.

9569
07:21:41,190 --> 07:21:41,930
That's gone.

9570
07:21:43,490 --> 07:21:44,010
Woah!

9571
07:21:47,910 --> 07:21:48,970
Captain America won!

9572
07:21:49,070 --> 07:21:49,550
I'm gonna cap.

9573
07:21:50,390 --> 07:21:52,130
Holy shit, I'm him!

9574
07:21:52,510 --> 07:21:53,370
I capped.

9575
07:21:54,750 --> 07:21:55,830
Cap point, hold corner.

9576
07:21:57,170 --> 07:21:57,450
Alright.

9577
07:21:58,090 --> 07:22:00,530
Mac, I can't see you for damage boost.

9578
07:22:01,130 --> 07:22:02,710
It's okay, I'm just being a bastard.

9579
07:22:03,030 --> 07:22:03,630
Here, I got you.

9580
07:22:03,970 --> 07:22:04,750
I leave now.

9581
07:22:05,310 --> 07:22:06,330
I'm playing solo.

9582
07:22:06,710 --> 07:22:08,870
Oh, that's fine.

9583
07:22:08,930 --> 07:22:10,050
I don't need to live anyway.

9584
07:22:15,010 --> 07:22:16,030
I broke a nest.

9585
07:22:16,770 --> 07:22:17,210
Nice.

9586
07:22:17,870 --> 07:22:18,770
I damage boosted you.

9587
07:22:19,290 --> 07:22:21,330
You're by yourself, Ruben, just so you know.

9588
07:22:21,450 --> 07:22:22,430
Nah, yeah, I'm chillin'.

9589
07:22:22,430 --> 07:22:23,230
I'm Captain America.

9590
07:22:24,890 --> 07:22:25,770
I'm chillin'.

9591
07:22:26,770 --> 07:22:27,210
Alright.

9592
07:22:27,450 --> 07:22:28,970
I'm fuckin' runnin' around.

9593
07:22:29,590 --> 07:22:30,510
What are they gonna do to me?

9594
07:22:30,670 --> 07:22:31,150
Kill me?

9595
07:22:31,290 --> 07:22:31,750
They kill you?

9596
07:22:32,270 --> 07:22:33,270
They're all going home.

9597
07:22:33,270 --> 07:22:33,590
Oh.

9598
07:22:36,990 --> 07:22:38,470
Oh my god, okay.

9599
07:22:41,490 --> 07:22:46,670
Alright, I'm just fuckin' I'm throwing leaves around and hoping things will be okay.

9600
07:22:50,970 --> 07:22:51,610
Nice.

9601
07:22:54,830 --> 07:22:56,210
Oh my god.

9602
07:22:57,070 --> 07:22:57,510
Luna low.

9603
07:22:58,850 --> 07:23:00,470
I'm gonna ult this.

9604
07:23:00,710 --> 07:23:01,870
I think it's worth, yeah.

9605
07:23:04,930 --> 07:23:04,970
Yay.

9606
07:23:07,790 --> 07:23:08,150
Alright.

9607
07:23:09,190 --> 07:23:10,370
I'm fuckin' going back.

9608
07:23:10,750 --> 07:23:11,990
Oh, I might be dead though.

9609
07:23:16,350 --> 07:23:16,710
Oh.

9610
07:23:19,070 --> 07:23:19,430
Nice.

9611
07:23:21,330 --> 07:23:23,050
Oh my god, you're so healthy.

9612
07:23:23,630 --> 07:23:24,930
I'm gonna get rid of this fire nest.

9613
07:23:25,090 --> 07:23:26,630
I'm trying to get rid of this fire nest right now.

9614
07:23:26,890 --> 07:23:27,650
I got rid of it.

9615
07:23:28,830 --> 07:23:29,570
I'm gonna ult here.

9616
07:23:31,390 --> 07:23:32,070
Where are you?

9617
07:23:32,270 --> 07:23:32,930
I got you.

9618
07:23:34,930 --> 07:23:36,470
Alright, this is where I die.

9619
07:23:37,950 --> 07:23:38,670
Assemble!

9620
07:23:40,470 --> 07:23:41,690
Oh my god.

9621
07:23:42,110 --> 07:23:43,650
Where was my assemble?

9622
07:23:44,650 --> 07:23:45,370
Assemble!

9623
07:23:46,370 --> 07:23:48,550
Where was my assemble, Ruben?

9624
07:23:48,910 --> 07:23:49,290
Yeah!

9625
07:23:50,870 --> 07:23:52,710
I lived, I did my job.

9626
07:23:56,870 --> 07:23:58,410
I hope you die next game.

9627
07:23:59,150 --> 07:23:59,610
Beautiful.

9628
07:24:00,490 --> 07:24:02,390
No, don't let me die!

9629
07:24:02,390 --> 07:24:03,850
No, please.

9630
07:24:04,710 --> 07:24:06,110
Wait, Mac has zero deaths.

9631
07:24:06,570 --> 07:24:07,010
He's better.

9632
07:24:07,270 --> 07:24:09,910
He's actually doing stuff.

9633
07:24:10,630 --> 07:24:16,190
Bro, my chat was like, it's cause Mantis isn't an Avenger.

9634
07:24:18,790 --> 07:24:20,210
That's so fucked.

9635
07:24:20,830 --> 07:24:21,830
That's so fucked.

9636
07:24:21,910 --> 07:24:23,750
Why did Starlord didn't die?

9637
07:24:24,390 --> 07:24:26,490
I'm just running around.

9638
07:24:26,750 --> 07:24:28,510
This is the funniest thing ever.

9639
07:24:29,670 --> 07:24:31,790
This hero is so silly.

9640
07:24:35,730 --> 07:24:37,990
We always get insta-queues.

9641
07:24:42,310 --> 07:24:45,610
Starlord Ping would play with 200 ping!

9642
07:24:46,650 --> 07:24:46,670
Crazy!

9643
07:24:48,690 --> 07:24:50,350
Damn, we should've avoid that guy.

9644
07:24:53,170 --> 07:24:53,770
Damn.

9645
07:24:54,590 --> 07:24:56,030
Poor guy is playing for both teams.

9646
07:24:59,110 --> 07:25:04,130
EU player thinks NA trash so he switch and he's Who the fuck is he stream sniping?

9647
07:25:04,230 --> 07:25:04,470
Me?

9648
07:25:05,350 --> 07:25:07,530
I predicted him being us.

9649
07:25:08,230 --> 07:25:10,710
Who the fuck is he stream sniping?

9650
07:25:20,150 --> 07:25:21,270
Hold up.

9651
07:25:21,350 --> 07:25:22,090
I have a plan.

9652
07:25:22,370 --> 07:25:25,090
That was not my plan.

9653
07:25:25,810 --> 07:25:26,910
What's your plan?

9654
07:25:27,170 --> 07:25:27,970
You're fine.

9655
07:25:28,330 --> 07:25:31,950
Oh my god.

9656
07:25:31,970 --> 07:25:33,150
How did you die?

9657
07:25:38,350 --> 07:25:39,870
Oh my god.

9658
07:25:40,070 --> 07:25:41,490
I'm gonna die here.

9659
07:25:41,610 --> 07:25:43,050
I just let myself die.

9660
07:25:43,350 --> 07:25:46,990
I was like, who do I want to get killed by?

9661
07:25:47,210 --> 07:25:48,030
The Starlord?

9662
07:25:48,330 --> 07:25:52,070
Or the Psylocke?

9663
07:25:56,880 --> 07:25:58,240
Just group up here.

9664
07:25:59,040 --> 07:25:59,560
Alright.

9665
07:26:07,470 --> 07:26:08,510
It's fine.

9666
07:26:09,150 --> 07:26:10,190
He's so healthy.

9667
07:26:12,430 --> 07:26:13,310
He's half.

9668
07:26:13,450 --> 07:26:14,290
Oh, he's got healed.

9669
07:26:14,850 --> 07:26:15,970
Can't believe you get healed.

9670
07:26:18,910 --> 07:26:21,230
Oh, Ruben, you're taking so much damage.

9671
07:26:23,790 --> 07:26:24,510
He's asleep.

9672
07:26:24,610 --> 07:26:24,930
He's asleep.

9673
07:26:25,650 --> 07:26:26,610
I'm gonna ult this.

9674
07:26:27,530 --> 07:26:28,030
Here you go.

9675
07:26:32,610 --> 07:26:33,870
Oh my god.

9676
07:26:33,930 --> 07:26:38,910
Oh my god.

9677
07:26:38,910 --> 07:26:42,350
Yeah, but we might have to use ours after this too.

9678
07:26:43,490 --> 07:26:44,190
I feel like.

9679
07:26:49,420 --> 07:26:50,320
Oh my god.

9680
07:26:50,460 --> 07:26:51,720
Please get a nice.

9681
07:26:56,040 --> 07:26:58,460
They have Psylocke and

9682
07:27:02,020 --> 07:27:04,900
Psylocke and and Penny on.

9683
07:27:07,220 --> 07:27:08,420
And Starlord.

9684
07:27:12,700 --> 07:27:15,020
I'm gonna assemble all over the place.

9685
07:27:15,540 --> 07:27:16,660
I'm gonna ult behind them.

9686
07:27:20,000 --> 07:27:21,500
I'm giving it to everyone.

9687
07:27:22,640 --> 07:27:23,720
Are we okay?

9688
07:27:24,360 --> 07:27:26,480
Alright, that's cool.

9689
07:27:27,020 --> 07:27:28,700
I just assembled so hard.

9690
07:27:29,560 --> 07:27:31,180
I killed two, but I killed myself.

9691
07:27:31,920 --> 07:27:32,800
That's fine, that's fine.

9692
07:27:32,900 --> 07:27:33,760
We killed three in the back.

9693
07:27:34,600 --> 07:27:36,520
We gotta kill the Penny.

9694
07:27:39,580 --> 07:27:40,460
Oh my.

9695
07:27:41,040 --> 07:27:41,600
Penny's one.

9696
07:27:42,440 --> 07:27:43,280
Guys, are you guys okay?

9697
07:27:46,860 --> 07:27:49,820
Please, I killed the freaking Cloak.

9698
07:27:53,840 --> 07:27:56,780
Because I'm like thinking, who else could he be stream sniping?

9699
07:27:56,940 --> 07:27:58,320
It's only us three that are streaming.

9700
07:27:58,900 --> 07:27:59,920
Four DPS.

9701
07:28:01,720 --> 07:28:02,560
Four DPS?

9702
07:28:03,000 --> 07:28:04,340
Oh my god, he's right.

9703
07:28:06,800 --> 07:28:08,080
I got you.

9704
07:28:10,540 --> 07:28:12,340
That Starlord's low, by the way.

9705
07:28:14,560 --> 07:28:15,460
He's in the air.

9706
07:28:15,840 --> 07:28:16,920
Yeah, he's so low.

9707
07:28:17,520 --> 07:28:18,880
Might be healed now, though.

9708
07:28:20,320 --> 07:28:21,860
Don't overextend, he said.

9709
07:28:22,000 --> 07:28:22,500
Oh shit.

9710
07:28:24,680 --> 07:28:25,620
We're fine.

9711
07:28:29,240 --> 07:28:32,360
I gave damage boost back.

9712
07:28:33,340 --> 07:28:34,580
He tried to hook me.

9713
07:28:39,490 --> 07:28:41,550
Guys, I can't do any headshots if they don't push up.

9714
07:28:44,950 --> 07:28:46,670
Let me know when they walk in and I'll drop.

9715
07:28:46,910 --> 07:28:47,890
Let me know when they walk in and I'll drop.

9716
07:28:51,110 --> 07:28:52,070
Where are you?

9717
07:28:54,850 --> 07:28:56,810
Oh, they did everything.

9718
07:28:57,890 --> 07:29:00,030
They did everything.

9719
07:29:00,170 --> 07:29:01,190
It's everything.

9720
07:29:01,350 --> 07:29:02,210
Do we live?

9721
07:29:03,250 --> 07:29:03,890
Ensemble!

9722
07:29:05,130 --> 07:29:05,950
Oh my god.

9723
07:29:07,850 --> 07:29:09,490
Oh my god.

9724
07:29:09,590 --> 07:29:11,290
Oh my god.

9725
07:29:11,610 --> 07:29:13,350
That's actually everything.

9726
07:29:14,030 --> 07:29:14,630
What the fuck?

9727
07:29:15,870 --> 07:29:16,510
Wow.

9728
07:29:17,370 --> 07:29:18,790
I didn't even know what to look at.

9729
07:29:18,830 --> 07:29:20,170
I was so confused.

9730
07:29:20,170 --> 07:29:21,730
Which one was my loot hold?

9731
07:29:22,530 --> 07:29:25,230
Dude, Captain America is so fun.

9732
07:29:25,410 --> 07:29:26,710
Oh my god.

9733
07:29:31,710 --> 07:29:33,350
Holy press Q.

9734
07:29:34,210 --> 07:29:36,070
OCE player?

9735
07:29:36,690 --> 07:29:37,210
Nissan?

9736
07:29:37,750 --> 07:29:40,090
Holy shit, what the fuck?

9737
07:29:40,850 --> 07:29:42,490
Oh my god.

9738
07:29:44,010 --> 07:29:45,370
Yeah, GM2!

9739
07:29:46,930 --> 07:29:48,350
Yeah, GM2!

9740
07:29:50,170 --> 07:29:51,290
Oh my god.

9741
07:29:51,390 --> 07:29:53,870
Top .09%.

9742
07:29:53,870 --> 07:29:55,570
Who was their player?

9743
07:29:55,930 --> 07:29:56,430
That was like...

9744
07:29:56,430 --> 07:29:59,110
You avoided them?

9745
07:29:59,490 --> 07:30:04,470
I mean, all their DPS lineup their stat numbers are not that great.

9746
07:30:05,290 --> 07:30:08,410
I feel like...

9747
07:30:08,410 --> 07:30:09,910
Their entire stat line...

9748
07:30:09,910 --> 07:30:10,950
That guy was horrible.

9749
07:30:11,150 --> 07:30:12,310
He kept trying to 1v1 me.

9750
07:30:12,390 --> 07:30:13,230
He's just getting slammed.

9751
07:30:14,070 --> 07:30:14,710
Yeah.

9752
07:30:17,410 --> 07:30:18,590
Oh my god.

9753
07:30:19,210 --> 07:30:20,070
We did it.

9754
07:30:20,370 --> 07:30:22,670
I got to feel like...

9755
07:30:22,670 --> 07:30:24,170
In GM2 again.

9756
07:30:24,490 --> 07:30:25,610
To see what it's like.

9757
07:30:26,270 --> 07:30:27,170
GM1 next.

9758
07:30:27,690 --> 07:30:29,130
Whoa, okay.

9759
07:30:29,990 --> 07:30:31,110
I hope so.

9760
07:30:31,490 --> 07:30:34,750
I want to end top 500 this season.

9761
07:30:35,690 --> 07:30:36,450
You will.

9762
07:30:37,030 --> 07:30:37,890
Mac, what?

9763
07:30:37,970 --> 07:30:40,110
Okay, I know Ruben will gas me up no matter what.

9764
07:30:40,110 --> 07:30:40,970
But Mac, do you?

9765
07:30:45,430 --> 07:30:47,970
But Mac, I know you'd tell the truth.

9766
07:30:49,110 --> 07:30:52,230
Do you think I have what it takes to be Eternity?

9767
07:30:53,610 --> 07:30:55,410
Yeah, your support is actually good.

9768
07:30:55,650 --> 07:30:56,250
Oh, thank you.

9769
07:30:56,570 --> 07:30:57,010
Really?

9770
07:30:58,090 --> 07:31:03,050
I mean, to be fair, you're queuing with me so I'm dragging you down with me if you don't think I'm good enough.

9771
07:31:03,890 --> 07:31:05,030
Nah, yeah, it's fine.

9772
07:31:05,090 --> 07:31:05,490
You're good.

9773
07:31:06,850 --> 07:31:09,210
As long as you don't play tank, I think we're fine.

9774
07:31:09,690 --> 07:31:10,150
Yay!

9775
07:31:10,870 --> 07:31:12,090
What happened on tank?

9776
07:31:13,730 --> 07:31:16,430
I haven't seen it yet, but she said she's horrible at it.

9777
07:31:16,430 --> 07:31:18,250
No, I had less than an hour on tank.

9778
07:31:18,910 --> 07:31:20,970
Let's put her on Captain America next game.

9779
07:31:24,070 --> 07:31:25,150
See what happens.

9780
07:31:25,190 --> 07:31:26,250
Just a little experiment.

9781
07:31:27,490 --> 07:31:29,090
Yeah, we'll just 5v6 next game.

9782
07:31:31,050 --> 07:31:33,330
I'm still thinking back about that time.

9783
07:31:33,490 --> 07:31:36,090
The guy was like 27% accuracy.

9784
07:31:36,090 --> 07:31:37,590
Yeah, that's a female player.

9785
07:31:37,770 --> 07:31:39,970
I'm still thinking about that guy.

9786
07:31:40,830 --> 07:31:42,230
You're one of the good ones.

9787
07:31:42,310 --> 07:31:43,130
Just remember that.

9788
07:31:43,450 --> 07:31:45,830
He's like, yeah, you're one of the good ones.

9789
07:31:46,050 --> 07:31:47,270
I just can't.

9790
07:31:47,270 --> 07:31:49,710
I can't help but think about that chat.

9791
07:31:53,710 --> 07:31:55,230
One of the good ones.

9792
07:31:55,410 --> 07:31:56,850
What the fuck?

9793
07:31:58,670 --> 07:32:03,210
He's like so misogynist but yet not at the same time.

9794
07:32:03,210 --> 07:32:03,250
What?

9795
07:32:05,070 --> 07:32:06,770
How is he not?

9796
07:32:07,150 --> 07:32:11,350
I feel like I just changed his world view when I said I was female.

9797
07:32:11,990 --> 07:32:13,450
I'm a female player.

9798
07:32:15,250 --> 07:32:16,270
God damn.

9799
07:32:17,450 --> 07:32:21,190
Also, we got to GM2 and now we're sitting in a fucking Overwatch queue time.

9800
07:32:21,270 --> 07:32:21,830
What is this?

9801
07:32:23,130 --> 07:32:27,710
We are the remaining GM2 players playing on Christmas.

9802
07:32:28,770 --> 07:32:30,790
Did we all get GM2 back that game?

9803
07:32:30,790 --> 07:32:32,050
No, no.

9804
07:32:32,590 --> 07:32:35,250
Mac is ahead of us by a couple.

9805
07:32:36,930 --> 07:32:40,630
Yeah, because he's higher elo.

9806
07:32:41,970 --> 07:32:44,770
How is your bar so low compared to us?

9807
07:32:45,750 --> 07:32:46,990
What's wrong with your internet?

9808
07:32:48,370 --> 07:32:49,110
My bar?

9809
07:32:49,230 --> 07:32:51,290
Yeah, your like yellow bar for me.

9810
07:32:51,530 --> 07:32:54,090
What servers are we on?

9811
07:32:54,230 --> 07:32:54,730
All of them?

9812
07:32:55,470 --> 07:32:58,530
I still haven't put East back on.

9813
07:33:01,110 --> 07:33:06,850
The Oregon server is fucked because I'm getting like 70 ping to it when normally it would be 40.

9814
07:33:07,130 --> 07:33:09,030
Yeah, yeah, the servers are horrible.

9815
07:33:09,370 --> 07:33:10,550
They got to fix something.

9816
07:33:11,050 --> 07:33:16,570
I know Reg a shitload if I play projectile characters and my ping is way higher than it should be.

9817
07:33:18,030 --> 07:33:22,690
My ping goes from anywhere from like 80 to like 140 sometimes.

9818
07:33:23,170 --> 07:33:23,990
That's weird.

9819
07:33:24,750 --> 07:33:28,650
Yeah, in other games I get like 20 to 40 ping in other games.

9820
07:33:28,650 --> 07:33:30,630
And if I'm on Texas server I got 8.

9821
07:33:30,990 --> 07:33:34,510
Which is just, I'm doing the worm when I play on Texas.

9822
07:33:36,770 --> 07:33:38,410
So fucked up.

9823
07:33:38,990 --> 07:33:39,370
Dude.

9824
07:33:41,030 --> 07:33:42,490
We're climbing guys.

9825
07:33:43,230 --> 07:33:44,410
Can you bring us some?

9826
07:33:44,770 --> 07:33:47,270
Guys, I can't believe we're climbing.

9827
07:33:47,690 --> 07:33:49,590
I don't know how that feels like.

9828
07:33:49,910 --> 07:33:51,650
I don't know what that feels like anymore.

9829
07:33:52,350 --> 07:33:56,730
It's such a new experience chat.

9830
07:33:56,730 --> 07:33:58,410
That's my fucking news.

9831
07:33:59,550 --> 07:34:01,470
We started on GM2.

9832
07:34:01,590 --> 07:34:02,930
No, please I can't.

9833
07:34:02,970 --> 07:34:04,550
We have to end on GM2.

9834
07:34:04,730 --> 07:34:05,070
Guys.

9835
07:34:05,670 --> 07:34:12,190
If any, GM1 is a bonus, but if anything it took me 6 hours to get back here.

9836
07:34:12,490 --> 07:34:15,290
It took me 6 hours to get back here chat.

9837
07:34:16,010 --> 07:34:24,730
Honestly like, I don't know what is up with, I think like competitive wise, but like when I stream competitive games, I don't get tired.

9838
07:34:24,730 --> 07:34:26,890
I can stream it for a very long time.

9839
07:34:27,230 --> 07:34:29,830
Now I know how designful felt when he went 24 hours.

9840
07:34:30,610 --> 07:34:36,270
If I have enough players to play with, I can actually just keep going.

9841
07:34:36,430 --> 07:34:41,430
I can legitimately just keep going until I get what I want.

9842
07:34:43,230 --> 07:34:46,590
But like for any other game, I get tired after a while.

9843
07:34:46,850 --> 07:34:54,910
Like when Trevor was saying how when you YouTube VTubers, you get tired after 4-5 hours and you call it a day.

9844
07:34:55,290 --> 07:34:58,970
I'm like, true, but for rival rivals, I can keep going.

9845
07:34:59,330 --> 07:35:03,790
I can just play I can play for as long as I want.

9846
07:35:06,890 --> 07:35:08,430
I know, I shouldn't.

9847
07:35:08,490 --> 07:35:09,790
I shouldn't, it's not healthy.

9848
07:35:10,130 --> 07:35:11,710
I can't help it.

9849
07:35:12,030 --> 07:35:14,190
Also, CaptainGira, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

9850
07:35:14,310 --> 07:35:14,930
Thank you, thank you.

9851
07:35:14,950 --> 07:35:15,570
It's Christmas.

9852
07:35:15,690 --> 07:35:22,010
Yeah, that's why we're gonna have a Christmas karaoke later today.

9853
07:35:22,830 --> 07:35:25,810
I was just setting up stuff for it too.

9854
07:35:26,070 --> 07:35:27,190
I don't know what to do.

9855
07:35:28,450 --> 07:35:32,650
Also, for those who are new here, for those who are new here, my name is DokiBird.

9856
07:35:33,530 --> 07:35:44,570
I usually stream on YouTube, but I'm doing my Marvel Rivals grind on Twitch because I did a 3-day stream on Marvel Rivals when it first launched where I got to top 500 within 3 days.

9857
07:35:46,710 --> 07:35:53,650
And now I'll just do the rest of the grind here on Twitch because I don't know when I'll be able to get to top 500, like end on top 500.

9858
07:35:53,930 --> 07:35:56,030
I feel like I'm gonna be playing this for a fucking ever.

9859
07:35:59,350 --> 07:36:00,370
Oh, what'd he get?

9860
07:36:00,450 --> 07:36:01,350
A chocolate chip what?

9861
07:36:02,430 --> 07:36:08,170
Yes, please check me out on YouTube and follow me on Twitter if you guys like wanna check me out more.

9862
07:36:08,410 --> 07:36:12,290
I usually tweet out when I'm streaming on Twitch and it's gonna be GorillaStreams most likely.

9863
07:36:12,690 --> 07:36:16,510
So like, like impromptu streams with no schedule and stuff for Twitch streams.

9864
07:36:16,870 --> 07:36:18,210
And also, buy my merch.

9865
07:36:18,450 --> 07:36:19,330
You know, I have an Android.

9866
07:36:19,330 --> 07:36:21,290
I have an Android pre-order.

9867
07:36:21,510 --> 07:36:22,750
For those who are like, whoa!

9868
07:36:23,470 --> 07:36:24,810
She might be a pretty big deal.

9869
07:36:28,790 --> 07:36:29,710
Wait a minute.

9870
07:36:29,970 --> 07:36:34,810
She seems, she actually seems pretty important if she has an Android deal.

9871
07:36:35,390 --> 07:36:36,970
Alright, where the fuck is my thing?

9872
07:36:37,170 --> 07:36:37,910
Is it this one?

9873
07:36:39,350 --> 07:36:40,950
Yeah, look guys.

9874
07:36:41,130 --> 07:36:46,590
For those who are new here, who don't know about my Nendroid.

9875
07:36:46,590 --> 07:36:49,710
Yes, this person might not look like me but this was me.

9876
07:36:51,110 --> 07:36:52,850
They're like, wait a minute.

9877
07:36:52,950 --> 07:36:54,250
That does look like you right now.

9878
07:36:54,390 --> 07:36:55,170
This was me.

9879
07:36:55,790 --> 07:36:59,990
Do we have enough sales on this retro jokey version?

9880
07:37:00,410 --> 07:37:01,270
Who's that?

9881
07:37:02,750 --> 07:37:04,450
Who the fuck is that?

9882
07:37:04,610 --> 07:37:09,070
You can tell who are new here who's just watching Marvel Rivals.

9883
07:37:09,650 --> 07:37:12,490
But this was me, but now it's not me.

9884
07:37:13,210 --> 07:37:14,590
I mean, it's still me.

9885
07:37:14,590 --> 07:37:15,770
It's still me.

9886
07:37:15,990 --> 07:37:18,210
But like, I look like this now.

9887
07:37:18,350 --> 07:37:22,410
But we have more, we have a lot of sales on retro dokey.

9888
07:37:22,630 --> 07:37:24,590
We might get current dokey.

9889
07:37:28,610 --> 07:37:31,550
Yeah, so yeah, that's me.

9890
07:37:32,710 --> 07:37:34,870
I'll put it here while we're waiting queue.

9891
07:37:37,950 --> 07:37:38,750
Guys, now.

9892
07:37:38,890 --> 07:37:39,650
Oh, yeah!

9893
07:37:40,130 --> 07:37:43,570
I was gonna say, now I know why I got a 15 minute queue earlier.

9894
07:37:43,570 --> 07:37:44,790
But it's okay, we're in.

9895
07:37:45,190 --> 07:37:46,750
This is a fucking...

9896
07:37:47,330 --> 07:37:48,890
This is a hard game.

9897
07:37:49,750 --> 07:37:52,390
This is gonna be a hard game.

9898
07:37:54,810 --> 07:37:56,490
Yeah, but we have Kelvin.

9899
07:37:57,090 --> 07:37:59,190
We have Kelvin.

9900
07:37:59,430 --> 07:38:01,330
We have one above all.

9901
07:38:02,090 --> 07:38:03,370
And they have Jesus.

9902
07:38:04,690 --> 07:38:08,590
Wait, they have Groot God and LCQ Jesus.

9903
07:38:10,250 --> 07:38:13,870
Maybe his name is Groot God to get us to ban Groot.

9904
07:38:13,870 --> 07:38:14,930
Oh, that's true.

9905
07:38:15,510 --> 07:38:16,830
I'm gonna ban Groot.

9906
07:38:17,650 --> 07:38:21,650
Wait, guys, can somebody look up Groot God 69's profile and tell me?

9907
07:38:22,030 --> 07:38:23,250
Yeah, someone check really quick.

9908
07:38:23,350 --> 07:38:24,310
Come on, go, go, go.

9909
07:38:24,310 --> 07:38:30,430
Someone who has Marvel Rivals up right now.

9910
07:38:30,850 --> 07:38:34,990
Look up Groot God 69 and look at their statistic.

9911
07:38:35,330 --> 07:38:37,770
Are they a Groot one trick and now ban Groot.

9912
07:38:41,670 --> 07:38:44,490
Our guy is taking half an hour to load and I'm scared.

9913
07:38:44,650 --> 07:38:45,450
Oh, it's not me.

9914
07:38:45,510 --> 07:38:46,510
At least it's not me.

9915
07:38:46,690 --> 07:38:48,430
At least it's not you DC.

9916
07:38:50,530 --> 07:38:53,190
Some people are like I'm launching it right now.

9917
07:38:55,190 --> 07:38:55,670
I'm...

9918
07:38:56,650 --> 07:38:57,130
Alright.

9919
07:38:57,590 --> 07:38:59,170
Guys, pull up the info faster.

9920
07:38:59,450 --> 07:39:02,850
Guys, it determines whether or not we ban Groot.

9921
07:39:04,850 --> 07:39:06,110
It's the choice.

9922
07:39:06,570 --> 07:39:09,370
The most important decisions of our lives right now.

9923
07:39:09,370 --> 07:39:14,430
Elicit saw LQC Jesus and was terrified shameless.

9924
07:39:17,110 --> 07:39:21,450
I Googled Groot 69 and I don't feel so good.

9925
07:39:22,410 --> 07:39:23,050
Guys, no.

9926
07:39:23,250 --> 07:39:25,190
You missed out the God part.

9927
07:39:25,550 --> 07:39:30,350
Guys, this is not, technically this isn't stream sniping.

9928
07:39:30,530 --> 07:39:32,350
It's called gathering intel.

9929
07:39:33,350 --> 07:39:36,230
We're nearly just scouting up their stats.

9930
07:39:36,230 --> 07:39:36,890
Exactly.

9931
07:39:38,970 --> 07:39:39,950
Completely different.

9932
07:39:40,210 --> 07:39:41,230
Completely different.

9933
07:39:41,690 --> 07:39:44,290
I mean, pro teams do it.

9934
07:39:44,350 --> 07:39:46,790
They scout out people, what they play and everything.

9935
07:39:46,890 --> 07:39:50,370
Yeah, they try getting other people scrim vods and checking them out.

9936
07:39:50,390 --> 07:39:54,370
Someone's like, GrootGod69 has 81 wins out of 114.

9937
07:39:54,490 --> 07:39:55,550
Holy fuck.

9938
07:39:55,630 --> 07:39:57,370
Is it on Groot though?

9939
07:39:57,530 --> 07:40:00,110
Is he on Groot though?

9940
07:40:00,310 --> 07:40:01,370
Is it on Groot though?

9941
07:40:01,470 --> 07:40:02,030
That's the important part.

9942
07:40:02,050 --> 07:40:03,890
We don't need to know their stats, guys.

9943
07:40:03,890 --> 07:40:07,390
We don't need to know that he has an 80% win rate, guys.

9944
07:40:07,590 --> 07:40:09,410
That's unnecessary information.

9945
07:40:09,530 --> 07:40:10,070
We need to know.

9946
07:40:12,530 --> 07:40:17,310
Bro, we waited a half an hour for that game.

9947
07:40:23,230 --> 07:40:25,550
This is an entirely different match.

9948
07:40:25,570 --> 07:40:27,230
This is a completely different...

9949
07:40:27,230 --> 07:40:28,330
How the fuck?

9950
07:40:30,370 --> 07:40:33,710
Everyone from the last game just got tossed into limbo.

9951
07:40:34,730 --> 07:40:35,270
No.

9952
07:40:36,530 --> 07:40:41,310
The fucking GrootGod Intel there was no reason.

9953
07:40:41,790 --> 07:40:42,790
It was pointless.

9954
07:40:43,490 --> 07:40:45,750
Our guy dodged because he was so scared of the Groot.

9955
07:40:46,350 --> 07:40:48,050
He was scared of GrootGod69.

9956
07:40:48,970 --> 07:40:49,990
Alright, who are we banning?

9957
07:40:50,230 --> 07:40:50,490
Hawk?

9958
07:40:51,670 --> 07:40:52,550
Yeah, Hawkeye.

9959
07:40:55,270 --> 07:40:57,030
And then Bruce Laughter.

9960
07:40:57,550 --> 07:41:00,670
I love how I still don't know what he plays.

9961
07:41:01,030 --> 07:41:05,130
My chat has only told me that it's an 80% win rate.

9962
07:41:05,930 --> 07:41:07,090
Oh, he was a strange player?

9963
07:41:07,730 --> 07:41:10,030
Oh, so he was fucking with us.

9964
07:41:10,350 --> 07:41:11,450
That's a genius.

9965
07:41:13,270 --> 07:41:15,310
I can't believe your chat.

9966
07:41:15,690 --> 07:41:18,970
Bro, you play everything.

9967
07:41:19,290 --> 07:41:22,090
You don't even main Starlord.

9968
07:41:23,570 --> 07:41:25,230
You literally play everything.

9969
07:41:25,390 --> 07:41:27,810
Should I toss a 5% vote in for Hella?

9970
07:41:29,190 --> 07:41:30,750
Wait, are we not banning Bruce?

9971
07:41:33,170 --> 07:41:33,930
I guess not.

9972
07:41:39,450 --> 07:41:40,470
That's 5.

9973
07:41:41,010 --> 07:41:49,910
Oh, they really are target banning you.

9974
07:41:50,230 --> 07:41:51,850
Can we...

9975
07:41:51,850 --> 07:41:52,650
got to?

9976
07:41:53,970 --> 07:41:55,190
You don't even...

9977
07:41:55,190 --> 07:41:58,630
You literally started playing Starlord today.

9978
07:42:01,790 --> 07:42:04,070
Ain't no way y'all play only DPS.

9979
07:42:04,170 --> 07:42:05,410
I play support.

9980
07:42:11,330 --> 07:42:17,490
Do I ego and stay on DPS and hope that Gati 2k support or celebrating Christmas?

9981
07:42:18,050 --> 07:42:18,630
No, no, no, no.

9982
07:42:18,650 --> 07:42:19,010
I got it.

9983
07:42:20,310 --> 07:42:20,950
I got it.

9984
07:42:20,950 --> 07:42:23,050
I got it.

9985
07:42:23,990 --> 07:42:25,110
Iron Fist, baby.

9986
07:42:25,310 --> 07:42:25,490
Okay.

9987
07:42:26,610 --> 07:42:29,110
Oh, but your fucking Psylocke is insane, though.

9988
07:42:29,110 --> 07:42:30,830
Yeah, I know.

9989
07:42:31,710 --> 07:42:34,030
With your Psylocke, when your Psylocke's open, I'll support.

9990
07:42:34,290 --> 07:42:35,250
Okay, bet.

9991
07:42:36,690 --> 07:42:37,650
Thank you.

9992
07:42:38,810 --> 07:42:39,910
I'll make you proud.

9993
07:42:40,970 --> 07:42:41,830
I'm playing Jeff, though.

9994
07:42:42,950 --> 07:42:44,070
Okay, Mack, do you want Luna?

9995
07:42:44,510 --> 07:42:45,470
Mack, do you want Luna?

9996
07:42:49,310 --> 07:42:52,110
After we should talk to all those Jeff players, you cannot.

9997
07:42:53,110 --> 07:42:55,890
You've lost your privilege as a Jeff.

9998
07:42:55,890 --> 07:42:58,730
We can't threaten to turn them into fucking soup.

9999
07:42:59,030 --> 07:43:01,850
I saw how you yelled at that Jeff player.

10000
07:43:02,390 --> 07:43:03,590
He deserved it, though.

10001
07:43:03,630 --> 07:43:04,530
I'm one of the good ones.

10002
07:43:04,750 --> 07:43:07,350
Oh my god, you don't even like Jeff.

10003
07:43:08,610 --> 07:43:11,290
You can't be one of the good ones if you don't even.

10004
07:43:11,310 --> 07:43:12,430
Black Panther's above you guys.

10005
07:43:13,610 --> 07:43:14,490
Guys, guys.

10006
07:43:16,070 --> 07:43:17,110
I'm soulbinding us.

10007
07:43:17,510 --> 07:43:18,290
Thank you.

10008
07:43:18,430 --> 07:43:20,450
We lost Bob, though.

10009
07:43:20,450 --> 07:43:21,430
Bob.

10010
07:43:23,370 --> 07:43:24,150
Hey, Bob.

10011
07:43:24,470 --> 07:43:25,150
We lost.

10012
07:43:25,690 --> 07:43:26,590
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

10013
07:43:26,610 --> 07:43:27,450
We can catch this.

10014
07:43:31,390 --> 07:43:32,510
Oh my god.

10015
07:43:34,430 --> 07:43:35,530
I got the hella.

10016
07:43:38,510 --> 07:43:40,690
We gotta get Groot.

10017
07:43:40,730 --> 07:43:41,530
Oh, no.

10018
07:43:41,770 --> 07:43:44,050
I got Thor.

10019
07:43:46,350 --> 07:43:47,870
We gotta get Groot.

10020
07:43:47,870 --> 07:43:49,370
He's literally so little.

10021
07:43:51,730 --> 07:43:53,570
I gave you...

10022
07:43:53,570 --> 07:43:55,270
Oh my god, Groot.

10023
07:43:55,370 --> 07:43:55,750
Never mind.

10024
07:43:55,870 --> 07:43:56,470
You didn't have it.

10025
07:43:56,530 --> 07:43:58,190
Groot stood in front of me like three times.

10026
07:44:01,030 --> 07:44:02,610
I might need a little snap.

10027
07:44:12,270 --> 07:44:12,670
Villager?

10028
07:44:20,630 --> 07:44:21,150
Soulbinding.

10029
07:44:22,070 --> 07:44:23,750
Oh, I fucked up.

10030
07:44:24,470 --> 07:44:26,330
They're all really low, though.

10031
07:44:29,090 --> 07:44:29,970
I'm on the point.

10032
07:44:30,670 --> 07:44:31,270
Because there's a Black Panther.

10033
07:44:33,470 --> 07:44:34,370
Oh, no.

10034
07:44:34,370 --> 07:44:35,970
He was just chilling above you.

10035
07:44:42,870 --> 07:44:44,790
I'm gonna try...

10036
07:44:44,790 --> 07:44:46,410
Call out when they use emo, okay?

10037
07:44:46,530 --> 07:44:47,790
Oh, Panther.

10038
07:44:49,150 --> 07:44:50,270
You might need it.

10039
07:44:50,290 --> 07:44:51,050
Did they use emo yet?

10040
07:44:51,050 --> 07:44:52,470
I don't have soulbinding.

10041
07:44:52,470 --> 07:44:53,850
They used Luna.

10042
07:44:54,270 --> 07:44:56,910
Oh, you might need to rez us.

10043
07:44:57,310 --> 07:44:58,890
I'm gonna go try to run away.

10044
07:44:58,950 --> 07:45:00,210
You gotta hide.

10045
07:45:01,990 --> 07:45:03,370
We're dying on point.

10046
07:45:03,750 --> 07:45:05,030
We're losing point, though.

10047
07:45:05,070 --> 07:45:06,310
So I don't know if you should rez now.

10048
07:45:06,590 --> 07:45:07,230
No, I'm not.

10049
07:45:10,780 --> 07:45:11,810
Oh my god.

10050
07:45:12,090 --> 07:45:14,290
Yo, I need a heal please.

10051
07:45:16,330 --> 07:45:17,670
You're so healthy.

10052
07:45:17,670 --> 07:45:19,710
I was just too deep.

10053
07:45:19,990 --> 07:45:20,990
I'm fucking...

10054
07:45:20,990 --> 07:45:22,050
I'm gonna give it a buck.

10055
07:45:22,130 --> 07:45:24,730
I could've healed you, but I'm not in my heal mindset right now.

10056
07:45:24,750 --> 07:45:25,450
No, you're good.

10057
07:45:25,850 --> 07:45:27,050
That was on me.

10058
07:45:27,870 --> 07:45:29,770
No, I definitely could've pressed E.

10059
07:45:29,910 --> 07:45:31,050
You were like right in front of me.

10060
07:45:31,250 --> 07:45:32,970
It was 100% my fault.

10061
07:45:33,090 --> 07:45:33,990
You don't understand.

10062
07:45:34,230 --> 07:45:36,110
As Adam, it's very easy.

10063
07:45:36,390 --> 07:45:36,890
I died.

10064
07:45:39,590 --> 07:45:40,030
Okay.

10065
07:45:42,150 --> 07:45:45,250
Alright, I'm just gonna...

10066
07:45:45,250 --> 07:45:47,030
heal our Kingston.

10067
07:45:48,210 --> 07:45:50,850
I'll give you orb and see if you do anything.

10068
07:45:54,430 --> 07:45:55,570
I froze Penny.

10069
07:45:56,130 --> 07:45:57,350
Yeah, Penny can die.

10070
07:45:59,610 --> 07:46:01,190
She did not die.

10071
07:46:05,490 --> 07:46:06,830
I tried to heal him.

10072
07:46:07,070 --> 07:46:07,690
I have no heals.

10073
07:46:07,830 --> 07:46:08,750
I sold out for him.

10074
07:46:08,870 --> 07:46:11,110
Oh my god, I'm fucking... I'm scared now.

10075
07:46:13,290 --> 07:46:14,010
I broke it.

10076
07:46:14,390 --> 07:46:14,850
I got heal.

10077
07:46:14,910 --> 07:46:15,290
I got heal.

10078
07:46:15,290 --> 07:46:16,250
Oh, we should fight this.

10079
07:46:17,150 --> 07:46:18,210
We need to fight this.

10080
07:46:20,870 --> 07:46:21,390
Panther one.

10081
07:46:23,890 --> 07:46:24,810
I'm ulting on point.

10082
07:46:24,930 --> 07:46:25,470
I'm ulting on point.

10083
07:46:29,570 --> 07:46:30,590
They have Luna ult.

10084
07:46:30,690 --> 07:46:31,850
They have double Luna ult now.

10085
07:46:32,590 --> 07:46:33,250
I'm going to hide.

10086
07:46:34,710 --> 07:46:35,450
Alright, Mercy.

10087
07:46:35,590 --> 07:46:36,510
Go hide, Mercy.

10088
07:46:49,950 --> 07:46:51,030
Oh my god.

10089
07:46:51,030 --> 07:46:52,890
We... you might need to put up now.

10090
07:46:53,170 --> 07:46:53,770
We're all dying.

10091
07:46:55,190 --> 07:46:56,870
And if you can...

10092
07:46:56,870 --> 07:46:57,550
Soap on us.

10093
07:46:57,610 --> 07:46:58,210
Soap on us again.

10094
07:47:01,650 --> 07:47:03,290
There's mines just everywhere.

10095
07:47:03,610 --> 07:47:05,030
Oh, they're Black Panther squad.

10096
07:47:07,190 --> 07:47:09,370
I was not able to do anything there.

10097
07:47:10,870 --> 07:47:12,510
Alright, maybe you...

10098
07:47:13,000 --> 07:47:14,850
I'll get healed eventually.

10099
07:47:18,530 --> 07:47:19,250
Yeah, I know.

10100
07:47:20,130 --> 07:47:21,450
I think it's a swap angle.

10101
07:47:21,670 --> 07:47:23,710
Our tank was taking a lot of damage.

10102
07:47:31,830 --> 07:47:32,230
Alright.

10103
07:47:32,630 --> 07:47:34,290
Don't worry, now we have double the healing.

10104
07:47:36,210 --> 07:47:39,370
You know, I missed the first Q that we could've got.

10105
07:47:41,550 --> 07:47:43,370
I feel like that would've been a lot better.

10106
07:47:43,670 --> 07:47:44,870
I think that game would've been a lot...

10107
07:47:44,870 --> 07:47:44,990
There was just...

10108
07:47:45,590 --> 07:47:47,130
There was like a penny...

10109
07:47:48,190 --> 07:47:51,050
Spider nest, and there were a bunch of immortality fields.

10110
07:47:51,050 --> 07:47:53,710
I just don't think the Holy Bob might be a good...

10111
07:47:53,710 --> 07:47:55,070
I don't think he's a good group player.

10112
07:47:56,450 --> 07:47:56,690
Wait.

10113
07:47:56,890 --> 07:47:58,330
Oh, I just pressed that.

10114
07:48:00,090 --> 07:48:03,770
I did see him do a little bit of silliness every now and then.

10115
07:48:09,050 --> 07:48:11,170
Why is it always Hela that bitch and moans?

10116
07:48:11,850 --> 07:48:15,270
Look, he gets Hela banned like 90% of the time.

10117
07:48:15,710 --> 07:48:20,630
The fact that the one game he gets to play Hela and he fucking loses, I fucking bitch and moan too.

10118
07:48:23,230 --> 07:48:23,750
Alright.

10119
07:48:27,670 --> 07:48:28,190
Nice.

10120
07:48:28,430 --> 07:48:29,170
I am Brute.

10121
07:48:30,330 --> 07:48:31,270
Hello, Top Riot.

10122
07:48:32,670 --> 07:48:33,670
I am Brute.

10123
07:48:34,550 --> 07:48:36,490
Oh my god, this Hela still...

10124
07:48:36,490 --> 07:48:37,070
Oh, he's fine.

10125
07:48:37,130 --> 07:48:37,910
Our Hela killed him.

10126
07:48:38,490 --> 07:48:39,170
You're still healing.

10127
07:48:39,670 --> 07:48:41,610
I was just getting...

10128
07:48:43,030 --> 07:48:43,550
Fucking...

10129
07:48:43,550 --> 07:48:44,830
Forged by Hela.

10130
07:48:50,470 --> 07:48:51,730
Oh, I'm fucking...

10131
07:48:51,730 --> 07:48:52,190
Skating.

10132
07:48:53,470 --> 07:48:54,890
I'm skating over.

10133
07:48:59,930 --> 07:49:01,650
I have cloak off for this fight.

10134
07:49:02,210 --> 07:49:02,730
Nice.

10135
07:49:02,850 --> 07:49:03,470
I have ult too.

10136
07:49:04,090 --> 07:49:05,130
Hela, top left.

10137
07:49:05,810 --> 07:49:06,650
Heal first.

10138
07:49:07,730 --> 07:49:09,150
Can you heal our Hela?

10139
07:49:09,410 --> 07:49:09,910
Okay, nice.

10140
07:49:11,630 --> 07:49:13,030
Hela, top left.

10141
07:49:13,330 --> 07:49:14,350
Yeah, I'm pressuring her.

10142
07:49:20,180 --> 07:49:21,160
I got our Hela.

10143
07:49:22,300 --> 07:49:23,840
There's a guy to our right side.

10144
07:49:23,840 --> 07:49:25,680
I have no idea who he is.

10145
07:49:28,100 --> 07:49:29,560
Oh my god, Groot, please.

10146
07:49:30,220 --> 07:49:30,960
I can't see...

10147
07:49:30,960 --> 07:49:31,900
Hela, top right.

10148
07:49:32,460 --> 07:49:33,800
I ulted before I died.

10149
07:49:33,980 --> 07:49:36,080
I ulted the Groot.

10150
07:49:37,680 --> 07:49:39,060
Oh my god.

10151
07:49:39,880 --> 07:49:40,760
He's alive.

10152
07:49:41,220 --> 07:49:42,840
There's still a Hela on the right high ground, I think.

10153
07:49:43,720 --> 07:49:45,440
Oh, let's all press Q.

10154
07:49:48,000 --> 07:49:48,720
Ah, shit.

10155
07:49:48,980 --> 07:49:50,780
No, I don't think... That's 6 ults.

10156
07:49:50,780 --> 07:49:51,760
That's 6 ults.

10157
07:49:52,900 --> 07:49:54,780
They literally use every ult except for Pantheon.

10158
07:49:55,740 --> 07:49:56,760
Can he ult, maybe?

10159
07:50:01,760 --> 07:50:02,940
Alright, I'm coming back.

10160
07:50:09,950 --> 07:50:11,190
Alright, I'm putting on our Groot.

10161
07:50:14,090 --> 07:50:14,530
Jesus.

10162
07:50:21,950 --> 07:50:24,610
I'm healing our Captain America, so...

10163
07:50:25,190 --> 07:50:26,490
Yeah, I got them for now.

10164
07:50:27,030 --> 07:50:27,790
Alright, Hela.

10165
07:50:28,010 --> 07:50:29,010
That's a huge pick.

10166
07:50:31,190 --> 07:50:32,950
I'm trying to speed you guys up.

10167
07:50:34,490 --> 07:50:35,710
The Panthers won.

10168
07:50:37,410 --> 07:50:38,590
This is so low.

10169
07:50:38,750 --> 07:50:39,670
There we go.

10170
07:50:39,830 --> 07:50:40,270
Okay, okay.

10171
07:50:40,650 --> 07:50:41,870
If you beat this up, we...

10172
07:50:42,450 --> 07:50:43,530
We're locked in.

10173
07:50:43,830 --> 07:50:45,610
We're locked in the wall.

10174
07:50:48,090 --> 07:50:49,770
That's actually crazy.

10175
07:50:50,750 --> 07:50:51,090
No.

10176
07:50:57,270 --> 07:50:58,870
What do you want us to do?

10177
07:50:58,870 --> 07:51:02,090
There's 200 million people!

10178
07:51:03,730 --> 07:51:05,770
Oh, I'm dead.

10179
07:51:05,850 --> 07:51:06,370
I should've shifted.

10180
07:51:06,730 --> 07:51:07,830
I'm ulting this.

10181
07:51:08,190 --> 07:51:09,650
You just need to kill Penny.

10182
07:51:10,170 --> 07:51:10,870
That's a good gap.

10183
07:51:12,830 --> 07:51:14,230
Just kill Penny, please.

10184
07:51:15,110 --> 07:51:16,250
Oh, he's gonna live.

10185
07:51:16,600 --> 07:51:18,670
Back up, back up, back up, please!

10186
07:51:19,470 --> 07:51:20,430
Captain America!

10187
07:51:20,810 --> 07:51:22,330
I'm so fucking scared.

10188
07:51:24,550 --> 07:51:25,530
I have ult for this fight.

10189
07:51:25,530 --> 07:51:27,030
They used Groot ult on us, right?

10190
07:51:27,410 --> 07:51:27,550
No.

10191
07:51:28,710 --> 07:51:29,810
They did, okay.

10192
07:51:30,950 --> 07:51:31,750
I'm pretty sure they didn't.

10193
07:51:31,830 --> 07:51:32,490
Unless our Groot did.

10194
07:51:36,310 --> 07:51:40,540
I'm just forming a little triangle on point.

10195
07:51:42,860 --> 07:51:44,080
I might be dead, though.

10196
07:51:46,420 --> 07:51:47,660
Just die on point.

10197
07:51:52,220 --> 07:51:52,940
Die on point.

10198
07:51:53,000 --> 07:51:53,780
Don't let them cap it.

10199
07:51:59,700 --> 07:52:01,220
Don't let them cap it.

10200
07:52:02,160 --> 07:52:04,000
It's fine as long as we don't stagger.

10201
07:52:06,000 --> 07:52:06,940
Nice, good pick.

10202
07:52:09,920 --> 07:52:12,620
We can go in with a pick.

10203
07:52:17,820 --> 07:52:19,400
We should start going now.

10204
07:52:19,920 --> 07:52:22,560
Yeah, there's Panthers coming back.

10205
07:52:22,780 --> 07:52:23,560
No, no!

10206
07:52:24,180 --> 07:52:25,700
Captain America, don't worry!

10207
07:52:25,780 --> 07:52:26,740
You have the orb!

10208
07:52:29,420 --> 07:52:30,560
I'm shredding the Groot.

10209
07:52:30,560 --> 07:52:32,140
I hear someone behind me.

10210
07:52:34,520 --> 07:52:35,600
Oh no!

10211
07:52:35,860 --> 07:52:36,820
I'm trying, I'm trying.

10212
07:52:37,140 --> 07:52:41,600
I'm reloading.

10213
07:52:42,260 --> 07:52:43,440
Oh no, we lost.

10214
07:52:46,100 --> 07:52:47,560
You can break the wall!

10215
07:52:48,340 --> 07:52:49,200
I'm breaking the wall!

10216
07:52:49,620 --> 07:52:51,120
I'm trying so hard!

10217
07:52:52,320 --> 07:52:54,000
We got locked out.

10218
07:52:54,640 --> 07:52:57,460
We actually got locked out of the wall.

10219
07:52:57,660 --> 07:52:59,320
That's actually so unfortunate.

10220
07:53:00,560 --> 07:53:02,940
That's what I mean, these walls are so strong!

10221
07:53:06,240 --> 07:53:08,700
There's nothing we can do!

10222
07:53:09,000 --> 07:53:10,000
That's so annoying.

10223
07:53:10,440 --> 07:53:13,820
I wanna burn the fucking trees down!

10224
07:53:14,920 --> 07:53:16,920
Supports can't break the wall!

10225
07:53:18,220 --> 07:53:20,860
I was actually just shooting that thing.

10226
07:53:21,000 --> 07:53:22,620
I saw that, dude!

10227
07:53:23,760 --> 07:53:24,840
Supports can't...

10228
07:53:25,540 --> 07:53:28,320
Supports can't do anything against the wall!

10229
07:53:34,910 --> 07:53:37,750
Let's see, this is why deforestation is okay.

10230
07:53:40,090 --> 07:53:41,870
If I can cut it, if I can...

10231
07:53:41,870 --> 07:53:46,150
You saw me just shooting the fucking walls the entire time!

10232
07:53:46,210 --> 07:53:48,110
I saw you, I was watching you.

10233
07:53:48,670 --> 07:53:52,330
I just danced and tried to watch it as I danced.

10234
07:53:52,870 --> 07:53:54,230
That was so sad.

10235
07:53:54,910 --> 07:53:56,190
Did we avoid...

10236
07:53:56,190 --> 07:53:57,990
Oh, I think we have all DPS players again.

10237
07:53:59,590 --> 07:54:01,730
The Gattic guy is the... yeah.

10238
07:54:02,510 --> 07:54:03,750
Oh my god.

10239
07:54:03,950 --> 07:54:06,170
Oh my god!

10240
07:54:06,630 --> 07:54:08,410
Guys, I'm okay with being GM3 again.

10241
07:54:09,190 --> 07:54:10,830
No, no, no, we're getting it back.

10242
07:54:14,650 --> 07:54:16,030
Alright, Hawkeye?

10243
07:54:16,410 --> 07:54:16,970
Yeah.

10244
07:54:20,190 --> 07:54:23,130
Alright, we gotta start avoiding other DPS players too.

10245
07:54:23,950 --> 07:54:30,270
Okay, looks like we're not banning Hella because our guy really wants to play Hella.

10246
07:54:31,010 --> 07:54:32,710
But isn't that the...

10247
07:54:32,710 --> 07:54:34,170
Isn't that Hella from our last...

10248
07:54:34,170 --> 07:54:36,390
No, that's... he's the fucking god Hawkeye!

10249
07:54:37,870 --> 07:54:38,350
Right?

10250
07:54:38,550 --> 07:54:39,370
That's him!

10251
07:54:40,030 --> 07:54:41,290
Oh yeah, it was.

10252
07:54:41,730 --> 07:54:43,250
Okay, I'm not banning Hella, bro.

10253
07:54:43,330 --> 07:54:47,130
If he was a fucking god on Hella, like Hawkeye that time...

10254
07:54:47,130 --> 07:54:48,090
I'm banning Bruce.

10255
07:54:49,930 --> 07:54:51,250
We'll see who gets it.

10256
07:54:51,850 --> 07:54:54,690
I'm not 100%, but I'm pretty sure that's our Hella from last game.

10257
07:54:56,630 --> 07:54:58,550
Chat, is that our Hella from last game?

10258
07:55:00,270 --> 07:55:01,490
My Starlord's gone again!

10259
07:55:01,750 --> 07:55:02,970
You motherfuckers!

10260
07:55:03,590 --> 07:55:03,930
Damn.

10261
07:55:05,010 --> 07:55:05,870
Oh, it was?

10262
07:55:06,330 --> 07:55:09,230
No, our Hella from last game was Jervis.

10263
07:55:10,090 --> 07:55:11,210
Because he kept complaining.

10264
07:55:11,410 --> 07:55:12,490
Oh yeah, it was Jerwin.

10265
07:55:12,550 --> 07:55:14,770
Yeah, he was like, please, please, please, please!

10266
07:55:16,230 --> 07:55:17,650
Yeah, it's Jerwin, yeah.

10267
07:55:23,600 --> 07:55:25,580
Please, please, please, please.

10268
07:55:28,180 --> 07:55:31,680
Wait, no, no, no, no.

10269
07:55:39,810 --> 07:55:40,330
Okay.

10270
07:55:41,210 --> 07:55:42,150
Okay, we don't want him.

10271
07:55:42,590 --> 07:55:46,810
Yeah, because Gatik only plays Captain America, so I don't feel...

10272
07:55:46,810 --> 07:55:47,290
Oh, okay.

10273
07:55:47,770 --> 07:55:49,270
I don't feel confident in her.

10274
07:55:49,910 --> 07:55:51,470
Not confident about that.

10275
07:55:51,990 --> 07:55:52,950
It's very situational.

10276
07:56:01,670 --> 07:56:03,330
He played Cap last game, too.

10277
07:56:03,590 --> 07:56:03,930
Yeah.

10278
07:56:04,870 --> 07:56:06,890
He plays... he's a...

10279
07:56:08,190 --> 07:56:09,930
He's an Iron Fist Cap player.

10280
07:56:11,450 --> 07:56:13,690
What an interesting hero pool.

10281
07:56:14,390 --> 07:56:16,810
I mean, Captain America is like Iron Fist.

10282
07:56:16,950 --> 07:56:18,230
You both beat the shit out of people.

10283
07:56:18,230 --> 07:56:19,530
He's like Tank Iron Fist.

10284
07:56:19,630 --> 07:56:19,870
Yeah.

10285
07:56:26,880 --> 07:56:27,900
Oh, Jerwin is on the enemy team.

10286
07:56:27,900 --> 07:56:29,220
They're trying to break this wall up here.

10287
07:56:30,040 --> 07:56:30,700
On me?

10288
07:56:30,900 --> 07:56:31,440
They're probably done.

10289
07:56:41,530 --> 07:56:43,330
My aunt did the stupid shit, goddammit.

10290
07:56:43,970 --> 07:56:45,390
What the fuck?

10291
07:56:47,570 --> 07:56:49,750
We're trying to help you guys, but...

10292
07:56:51,730 --> 07:56:52,230
Whoa!

10293
07:56:55,630 --> 07:56:57,670
Okay, I'm fucking okay, I guess.

10294
07:56:57,790 --> 07:56:58,310
I'm dead.

10295
07:56:58,390 --> 07:56:59,070
You're not, though.

10296
07:57:06,590 --> 07:57:07,090
Whoa.

10297
07:57:07,390 --> 07:57:08,650
This is dangerous.

10298
07:57:10,170 --> 07:57:11,950
We're gonna get hit by people in the back.

10299
07:57:12,050 --> 07:57:12,830
Those who died early.

10300
07:57:13,690 --> 07:57:15,210
That's what I'm worried about.

10301
07:57:16,810 --> 07:57:17,850
Are they still on that high ground?

10302
07:57:18,570 --> 07:57:19,210
I can't...

10303
07:57:19,210 --> 07:57:19,950
Oh, yeah.

10304
07:57:19,950 --> 07:57:22,410
We're so...

10305
07:57:22,410 --> 07:57:23,550
fucking split up there.

10306
07:57:29,870 --> 07:57:32,170
This is so awkward to heal.

10307
07:57:32,790 --> 07:57:34,310
I just got fucking one-tapped.

10308
07:57:34,650 --> 07:57:36,310
I'm gonna go low-key here after my ult.

10309
07:57:36,970 --> 07:57:37,950
Because they have Black Panther.

10310
07:57:38,310 --> 07:57:39,630
And I can't fuck with that.

10311
07:57:46,870 --> 07:57:48,430
I'm gonna be fine, yo.

10312
07:57:51,310 --> 07:57:52,450
Come on.

10313
07:57:53,510 --> 07:57:54,150
Come on.

10314
07:57:54,150 --> 07:57:56,190
Show me your fucking...

10315
07:57:56,190 --> 07:57:58,550
Oh my god, I...

10316
07:57:59,630 --> 07:58:02,030
I healed you as much as I could.

10317
07:58:04,210 --> 07:58:06,430
I'm pocketing our fucking...

10318
07:58:06,430 --> 07:58:07,070
uh, health.

10319
07:58:08,010 --> 07:58:09,830
Can't there's one other Venom diving me?

10320
07:58:11,430 --> 07:58:12,750
I'm just getting...

10321
07:58:12,750 --> 07:58:13,750
Yeah, I can't...

10322
07:58:13,750 --> 07:58:14,490
I'm solo-healing.

10323
07:58:14,490 --> 07:58:14,930
What?

10324
07:58:18,900 --> 07:58:19,860
Uh-oh.

10325
07:58:20,300 --> 07:58:20,380
No!

10326
07:58:21,000 --> 07:58:22,020
I'm ulting this.

10327
07:58:23,520 --> 07:58:24,460
I'm ulting this.

10328
07:58:24,520 --> 07:58:25,220
We have to push up.

10329
07:58:26,220 --> 07:58:28,440
And I really don't want to play fucking...

10330
07:58:31,980 --> 07:58:32,940
No way!

10331
07:58:40,040 --> 07:58:41,120
There's nothing I can do!

10332
07:58:43,000 --> 07:58:45,260
I mean, there's Venom.

10333
07:58:45,500 --> 07:58:46,320
I just have to switch.

10334
07:58:46,440 --> 07:58:47,840
There's Venom just hard-focusing me.

10335
07:58:52,620 --> 07:58:53,260
Oh my god.

10336
07:58:53,540 --> 07:58:55,480
We can still have... I'm gonna low-key too.

10337
07:58:55,940 --> 07:58:57,020
Because of the Black Panther.

10338
07:58:57,680 --> 07:58:59,740
And we have Hella...

10339
07:58:59,740 --> 07:59:01,720
We have Hella for this anyway.

10340
07:59:06,160 --> 07:59:06,680
Alright.

10341
07:59:08,780 --> 07:59:10,240
Surely this guy dies.

10342
07:59:10,840 --> 07:59:11,260
He's blind.

10343
07:59:12,720 --> 07:59:13,720
I'm blocking Hella.

10344
07:59:14,560 --> 07:59:14,860
No!

10345
07:59:16,780 --> 07:59:17,560
I can't.

10346
07:59:17,560 --> 07:59:18,280
I can't go through.

10347
07:59:18,520 --> 07:59:19,600
I need somebody to open this door.

10348
07:59:20,160 --> 07:59:21,140
I got it.

10349
07:59:21,860 --> 07:59:23,220
I just got...

10350
07:59:23,220 --> 07:59:25,320
fucking killed while in a Luna ult.

10351
07:59:26,820 --> 07:59:27,500
Hella no burden!

10352
07:59:29,520 --> 07:59:31,600
I'm on the point, but...

10353
07:59:38,690 --> 07:59:41,570
Oh my god, I'm fucking... I'm fucking swapping everywhere.

10354
07:59:41,730 --> 07:59:42,830
I'm fucking switching.

10355
07:59:43,070 --> 07:59:43,630
I'm healing.

10356
07:59:46,830 --> 07:59:47,370
Ow.

10357
07:59:48,430 --> 07:59:50,870
I've just spawn-died six times in a row.

10358
07:59:52,630 --> 07:59:53,630
I'm so mad.

10359
07:59:59,550 --> 08:00:01,050
This is a little awkward here.

10360
08:00:01,970 --> 08:00:03,050
Don't worry, Hella.

10361
08:00:03,230 --> 08:00:05,770
My low-key clone will tank everything for you.

10362
08:00:07,170 --> 08:00:09,950
My low-key clone will continue to tank things for you.

10363
08:00:12,990 --> 08:00:13,510
Yes!

10364
08:00:14,130 --> 08:00:14,430
Oh.

10365
08:00:17,650 --> 08:00:18,250
There we go.

10366
08:00:20,990 --> 08:00:21,970
Venom is low.

10367
08:00:21,970 --> 08:00:22,010
Venom is low.

10368
08:00:22,970 --> 08:00:24,190
Venom is one.

10369
08:00:24,790 --> 08:00:26,290
We gotta push up.

10370
08:00:29,830 --> 08:00:31,390
I have...

10371
08:00:32,170 --> 08:00:34,030
There's a Panther above us.

10372
08:00:34,730 --> 08:00:35,210
I know.

10373
08:00:35,910 --> 08:00:36,690
No,

10374
08:00:42,560 --> 08:00:45,000
I needed to...

10375
08:00:48,000 --> 08:00:49,140
I'm good.

10376
08:00:51,940 --> 08:00:52,720
Damn.

10377
08:00:52,720 --> 08:00:53,040
I'm good.

10378
08:00:54,020 --> 08:00:55,260
Where the fuck is our Hella?

10379
08:00:55,400 --> 08:00:56,240
I need to clone her!

10380
08:00:57,740 --> 08:00:58,260
No!

10381
08:00:58,540 --> 08:00:59,680
Did she die?

10382
08:01:01,180 --> 08:01:03,000
Did our Hella die?

10383
08:01:03,180 --> 08:01:04,340
Oh, she did.

10384
08:01:04,380 --> 08:01:05,560
I was trying to clone her.

10385
08:01:11,660 --> 08:01:12,860
Oh my god.

10386
08:01:13,280 --> 08:01:14,320
You can walk around this.

10387
08:01:14,720 --> 08:01:15,400
Okay, fine.

10388
08:01:15,520 --> 08:01:16,100
I'll do that.

10389
08:01:18,620 --> 08:01:19,820
Just walk through it.

10390
08:01:19,820 --> 08:01:21,360
I walked through.

10391
08:01:26,950 --> 08:01:28,150
Oh, shit.

10392
08:01:29,270 --> 08:01:30,910
Are you serious?!

10393
08:01:31,990 --> 08:01:34,430
I'm through!

10394
08:01:34,850 --> 08:01:36,170
Jesus Christ.

10395
08:01:36,710 --> 08:01:37,670
I actually threw that.

10396
08:01:37,690 --> 08:01:39,850
Even through your ult?!

10397
08:01:39,850 --> 08:01:40,950
I actually threw that.

10398
08:01:41,070 --> 08:01:42,850
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

10399
08:01:43,610 --> 08:01:45,090
I'm actually so sad.

10400
08:01:45,450 --> 08:01:46,490
I actually threw that.

10401
08:01:46,590 --> 08:01:48,950
I can't believe I'm not tall enough for it.

10402
08:01:52,170 --> 08:01:53,690
Oh my god.

10403
08:01:55,390 --> 08:01:56,710
We gotta get points.

10404
08:02:02,650 --> 08:02:04,670
Oh my god.

10405
08:02:07,170 --> 08:02:08,530
I like...

10406
08:02:08,530 --> 08:02:15,390
Ulted as Hella and then I didn't realize I don't go taller than the rock so the rock blocked me the entire time.

10407
08:02:16,870 --> 08:02:17,310
I...

10408
08:02:17,310 --> 08:02:18,790
I thought people would avoid the cat.

10409
08:02:18,830 --> 08:02:19,730
I don't think he's the problem.

10410
08:02:19,890 --> 08:02:20,550
He just doesn't...

10411
08:02:20,550 --> 08:02:22,430
He's literally filling for us.

10412
08:02:25,190 --> 08:02:27,010
The gothic guy is literally filling.

10413
08:02:27,810 --> 08:02:29,110
Because he's a DPS player.

10414
08:02:36,400 --> 08:02:38,760
I thought I'd be taller than the fucking rock.

10415
08:02:39,020 --> 08:02:40,280
I don't... I don't know.

10416
08:02:40,500 --> 08:02:41,560
I never had to do that.

10417
08:02:44,460 --> 08:02:46,460
You know the rock that's on the side?

10418
08:02:46,460 --> 08:02:50,320
I thought when you're on the rock and you ult as Hella that you go above it.

10419
08:02:50,380 --> 08:02:51,140
But you don't.

10420
08:02:59,940 --> 08:03:01,500
I really... gothic shit.

10421
08:03:01,720 --> 08:03:03,140
I want gothic to play.

10422
08:03:04,060 --> 08:03:05,460
Because he's an Iron Fist player.

10423
08:03:05,580 --> 08:03:10,140
I wonder if he's good at Iron Fist or not.

10424
08:03:23,330 --> 08:03:24,110
I don't know.

10425
08:03:24,110 --> 08:03:25,930
I feel like we need to avoid these DPS players.

10426
08:03:26,390 --> 08:03:28,830
I need more avoids.

10427
08:03:29,870 --> 08:03:30,990
I have...

10428
08:03:30,990 --> 08:03:32,130
I think Reuben has avoids, right?

10429
08:03:32,250 --> 08:03:32,790
You have avoids?

10430
08:03:33,030 --> 08:03:33,970
I have one.

10431
08:03:38,850 --> 08:03:40,950
I thought we were going to be TPing.

10432
08:03:42,930 --> 08:03:43,490
Please.

10433
08:03:43,810 --> 08:03:44,190
Please.

10434
08:03:47,630 --> 08:03:48,710
There's a panther.

10435
08:03:48,710 --> 08:03:49,110
There's a panther.

10436
08:03:52,230 --> 08:03:52,910
Panther's low.

10437
08:03:53,050 --> 08:03:54,030
Panther's literally low.

10438
08:03:55,050 --> 08:03:55,910
Panther's one.

10439
08:03:56,510 --> 08:03:57,270
Oh my god.

10440
08:03:57,430 --> 08:03:58,110
Thank you.

10441
08:03:58,750 --> 08:03:59,650
Thank you.

10442
08:04:03,970 --> 08:04:05,410
Strange can die on the left, I think.

10443
08:04:11,370 --> 08:04:11,890
Okay.

10444
08:04:13,230 --> 08:04:14,650
I'm going on the flank here.

10445
08:04:15,650 --> 08:04:16,530
Oh my god.

10446
08:04:22,880 --> 08:04:24,200
He's so low over there.

10447
08:04:24,280 --> 08:04:24,780
I killed their Loki.

10448
08:04:25,780 --> 08:04:26,260
Nice.

10449
08:04:27,440 --> 08:04:28,220
Strange is low.

10450
08:04:28,560 --> 08:04:29,620
I have a panther on me.

10451
08:04:30,140 --> 08:04:30,420
All right.

10452
08:04:30,600 --> 08:04:31,820
Stand near this if you need...

10453
08:04:31,820 --> 08:04:32,100
Panther.

10454
08:04:32,440 --> 08:04:32,440
Panther.

10455
08:04:32,560 --> 08:04:32,820
Panther.

10456
08:04:33,660 --> 08:04:34,840
Panther and Strange.

10457
08:04:34,940 --> 08:04:37,560
Strange is low.

10458
08:04:38,400 --> 08:04:39,620
Oh my god.

10459
08:04:39,640 --> 08:04:40,360
He was so low.

10460
08:04:42,380 --> 08:04:43,660
I'm going to ult here in a sec.

10461
08:04:45,560 --> 08:04:46,180
Good ult.

10462
08:04:47,180 --> 08:04:48,180
They all walked out of it.

10463
08:04:48,180 --> 08:04:48,560
Never mind.

10464
08:04:48,640 --> 08:04:49,180
My ult sucks.

10465
08:04:50,640 --> 08:04:51,640
It's okay.

10466
08:04:52,180 --> 08:04:52,940
It's okay.

10467
08:04:53,920 --> 08:04:55,120
I killed Luna.

10468
08:04:57,480 --> 08:04:58,080
Wait.

10469
08:04:58,120 --> 08:04:58,480
I'm back.

10470
08:04:58,660 --> 08:04:58,880
Hello.

10471
08:05:01,740 --> 08:05:03,840
I can't do anything.

10472
08:05:04,520 --> 08:05:04,960
Damn.

10473
08:05:06,720 --> 08:05:07,380
No!

10474
08:05:08,060 --> 08:05:09,820
You can get another kill, I believe!

10475
08:05:12,200 --> 08:05:13,440
Oh my god.

10476
08:05:13,520 --> 08:05:14,000
No.

10477
08:05:14,000 --> 08:05:14,100
Oh.

10478
08:05:16,220 --> 08:05:16,680
I knew it.

10479
08:05:16,720 --> 08:05:17,200
I knew it.

10480
08:05:17,280 --> 08:05:19,480
I knew you could get another kill, but I might be dead now.

10481
08:05:21,860 --> 08:05:22,260
Okay.

10482
08:05:30,700 --> 08:05:31,500
I'm getting...

10483
08:05:32,100 --> 08:05:35,660
Oh, that's huge.

10484
08:05:35,760 --> 08:05:36,020
That's huge.

10485
08:05:37,740 --> 08:05:39,060
That's terrible for us.

10486
08:05:44,000 --> 08:05:46,260
I don't think it's worth...

10487
08:05:46,260 --> 08:05:47,840
I don't know if I should contest.

10488
08:05:48,140 --> 08:05:48,700
I killed Penny.

10489
08:05:49,160 --> 08:05:49,640
Okay.

10490
08:05:51,920 --> 08:05:52,480
Okay.

10491
08:05:53,020 --> 08:05:53,680
I'll copy you.

10492
08:05:53,760 --> 08:05:53,840
Okay.

10493
08:05:53,880 --> 08:05:54,700
I got one.

10494
08:05:58,600 --> 08:05:59,760
Oh my god.

10495
08:05:59,820 --> 08:06:00,900
Guess I don't copy you.

10496
08:06:01,840 --> 08:06:04,080
She doesn't even need LOS for that.

10497
08:06:04,720 --> 08:06:05,480
So dumb.

10498
08:06:07,620 --> 08:06:09,820
I got frozen in that?

10499
08:06:09,940 --> 08:06:10,380
Okay.

10500
08:06:11,300 --> 08:06:11,860
Yulted?

10501
08:06:12,100 --> 08:06:12,400
Oh no.

10502
08:06:12,400 --> 08:06:13,600
What happened?

10503
08:06:13,960 --> 08:06:16,480
Yeah, their Loki ulted and copied me.

10504
08:06:23,880 --> 08:06:25,080
That's okay, guys.

10505
08:06:25,740 --> 08:06:27,360
GM2 lobbies are hard.

10506
08:06:27,880 --> 08:06:28,400
No, no, no.

10507
08:06:28,520 --> 08:06:29,120
We win these.

10508
08:06:30,380 --> 08:06:31,200
It's okay.

10509
08:06:32,400 --> 08:06:32,880
What?

10510
08:06:33,420 --> 08:06:33,900
Okay.

10511
08:06:34,160 --> 08:06:34,920
I just got jumped.

10512
08:06:35,280 --> 08:06:36,840
Maybe we should just dodge this Q.

10513
08:06:37,100 --> 08:06:39,240
We're literally playing the same people over and over again.

10514
08:06:40,360 --> 08:06:42,700
Is it possible to dodge a Q at this rank?

10515
08:06:42,700 --> 08:06:43,940
No, you can't.

10516
08:06:43,980 --> 08:06:44,820
You just look at the list.

10517
08:06:45,160 --> 08:06:46,040
And see if they're in game.

10518
08:06:47,740 --> 08:06:50,780
I'm actually tired of playing against these same people.

10519
08:06:57,590 --> 08:07:02,430
I just shoot my gun and hope for the best.

10520
08:07:03,230 --> 08:07:03,950
I just...

10521
08:07:04,950 --> 08:07:06,490
I just shoot my gun.

10522
08:07:08,670 --> 08:07:11,470
I just shoot my gun and hope for the best.

10523
08:07:13,770 --> 08:07:15,170
At least I can get that guy.

10524
08:07:15,170 --> 08:07:16,730
Oh, I just got one-tapped.

10525
08:07:18,370 --> 08:07:20,210
Oh, portal, portal, portal.

10526
08:07:21,110 --> 08:07:21,510
What?

10527
08:07:24,310 --> 08:07:26,190
No, that's the enemy portal.

10528
08:07:26,530 --> 08:07:28,190
Goodbye, Overwatch Neil.

10529
08:07:28,410 --> 08:07:28,910
Goodbye.

10530
08:07:29,650 --> 08:07:30,070
No.

10531
08:07:31,910 --> 08:07:32,470
Fuck.

10532
08:07:33,670 --> 08:07:36,530
I think I have one more before I do rank.

10533
08:07:36,890 --> 08:07:37,330
I think.

10534
08:07:37,530 --> 08:07:38,090
Before I do.

10535
08:07:38,610 --> 08:07:40,370
Depends on how...

10536
08:07:40,370 --> 08:07:44,070
Depends on how fucked the the matchmaking was.

10537
08:07:51,590 --> 08:07:52,230
Yeah!

10538
08:07:52,670 --> 08:07:53,810
Holy shit!

10539
08:07:54,210 --> 08:07:55,530
I'm hanged by the thread!

10540
08:07:55,890 --> 08:07:56,370
Wait, wait, wait.

10541
08:07:56,690 --> 08:07:57,610
I wanna dodge that.

10542
08:07:57,930 --> 08:08:00,730
I don't wanna play with these failures and against them.

10543
08:08:01,250 --> 08:08:06,730
Okay, two more wins and then I'm GM2 again.

10544
08:08:07,530 --> 08:08:08,450
Oh, you deranked?

10545
08:08:08,850 --> 08:08:09,610
Yeah, I deranked.

10546
08:08:11,350 --> 08:08:11,670
Fuck.

10547
08:08:16,540 --> 08:08:17,760
Why are they just in team?

10548
08:08:17,760 --> 08:08:19,180
They're not even queuing.

10549
08:08:23,630 --> 08:08:27,710
The team that we just had and against, they're not even queuing.

10550
08:08:28,250 --> 08:08:28,970
What's wrong with them?

10551
08:08:28,990 --> 08:08:29,970
Are they all dodging too?

10552
08:08:30,110 --> 08:08:31,190
I'm so sorry.

10553
08:08:31,270 --> 08:08:33,310
If you're saying things, I can't hear you.

10554
08:08:33,790 --> 08:08:34,710
I think they're dodging.

10555
08:08:34,770 --> 08:08:35,210
Okay, no.

10556
08:08:35,350 --> 08:08:36,290
One of them is queuing.

10557
08:08:37,630 --> 08:08:38,470
The others are queuing.

10558
08:08:39,830 --> 08:08:42,230
Alright, while we dodge this queue, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

10559
08:08:42,830 --> 08:08:43,950
Alright, sounds good.

10560
08:08:48,350 --> 08:08:55,190
Guys, while Doki uses the bathroom, we should get five gifted subs and farm Valorant out of all the money they have left.

10561
08:08:56,290 --> 08:08:57,230
I fully agree.

10562
08:08:57,610 --> 08:09:00,650
Me, personally, I'm always down to make money off of Riot Games.

10563
08:09:01,170 --> 08:09:01,570
Yup.

10564
08:09:01,790 --> 08:09:02,230
Come on.

10565
08:09:02,290 --> 08:09:03,750
Get the five gifteds rolling in.

10566
08:09:03,990 --> 08:09:05,250
It'll be the funniest prank.

10567
08:09:05,410 --> 08:09:08,410
She'll come back and she'll be like, Whoa, where did all these five gifted come from?

10568
08:09:09,930 --> 08:09:11,250
And she'll never know.

10569
08:10:01,980 --> 08:10:02,460
What?

10570
08:10:03,180 --> 08:10:03,940
Oh, shit.

10571
08:10:05,360 --> 08:10:05,820
Ren!

10572
08:10:05,820 --> 08:10:05,900
Ren!

10573
08:10:07,660 --> 08:10:09,680
Thank you for the five gifted subs!

10574
08:10:09,880 --> 08:10:10,920
Thank you!

10575
08:10:11,200 --> 08:10:12,080
Oh my gosh.

10576
08:10:12,200 --> 08:10:14,300
I'm starting to hit it though.

10577
08:10:14,700 --> 08:10:15,660
I'm starting to...

10578
08:10:15,660 --> 08:10:16,600
Oh no, I fucked up.

10579
08:10:16,820 --> 08:10:21,040
I accidentally moved my layout around.

10580
08:10:21,120 --> 08:10:21,580
Oh no.

10581
08:10:22,000 --> 08:10:22,480
Oh, there you go.

10582
08:10:22,520 --> 08:10:23,000
I fixed it.

10583
08:10:23,220 --> 08:10:24,420
Guys, what if I just run ads?

10584
08:10:26,540 --> 08:10:27,640
Guys, I'm gonna run a...

10585
08:10:27,640 --> 08:10:29,200
I'm gonna run...

10586
08:10:29,200 --> 08:10:30,360
I'm gonna run a two minute ad.

10587
08:10:30,360 --> 08:10:30,940
I'm gonna run...

10588
08:10:34,460 --> 08:10:36,140
Just out of nowhere.

10589
08:10:36,840 --> 08:10:39,620
Hey guys, you know how to get out of ads?

10590
08:10:44,160 --> 08:10:44,500
Subscribe!

10591
08:10:46,040 --> 08:10:46,720
Yippee!

10592
08:10:54,550 --> 08:10:56,170
Oh my god.

10593
08:10:56,550 --> 08:10:57,630
Oh my god, wait.

10594
08:10:57,730 --> 08:10:59,550
Someone gifted five and you got five?

10595
08:10:59,550 --> 08:11:02,310
Oh my god, Mary, thank you for the ten gifted subs!

10596
08:11:02,690 --> 08:11:03,830
Thank you, thank you!

10597
08:11:05,770 --> 08:11:06,770
Sorry, Kat.

10598
08:11:06,910 --> 08:11:08,970
I hear you over your ads.

10599
08:11:18,080 --> 08:11:18,900
Oh my god.

10600
08:11:19,180 --> 08:11:20,020
Oh my god!

10601
08:11:20,560 --> 08:11:22,840
Thank you for the five gifted subs!

10602
08:11:23,020 --> 08:11:24,080
Thank you!

10603
08:11:24,520 --> 08:11:26,600
No ads here!

10604
08:11:27,840 --> 08:11:30,620
I don't really run ads before so there's no ads.

10605
08:11:30,740 --> 08:11:33,020
I'm just like, whoa, ads!

10606
08:11:35,520 --> 08:11:37,960
This is like the one few times I actually ran an ad.

10607
08:11:40,700 --> 08:11:45,080
I just figured, wait, how did I increase viewers by running an ad?

10608
08:11:45,480 --> 08:11:46,940
How does that happen?

10609
08:11:53,320 --> 08:11:54,220
Oh my god!

10610
08:11:54,800 --> 08:11:55,960
Oh my god, it's Provy!

10611
08:11:58,780 --> 08:11:59,980
Guys, remember that guy?

10612
08:12:00,900 --> 08:12:03,020
Oh my god, he lives rent-free in my head.

10613
08:12:03,200 --> 08:12:04,860
He still lives rent-free in my head.

10614
08:12:05,460 --> 08:12:08,380
I fucking love when my voids pay off.

10615
08:12:09,200 --> 08:12:10,920
Oh god, no, not Medic!

10616
08:12:11,980 --> 08:12:12,960
What's wrong with him?

10617
08:12:13,300 --> 08:12:14,320
He's so bad.

10618
08:12:16,040 --> 08:12:20,020
I played with this guy yesterday, so look, he's so fucking bad.

10619
08:12:21,920 --> 08:12:30,460
He's a Punisher one trick and then he was like, dude, this guy's missing me with his turret and I'm taking damage and we're like, you know it's splash damage, right?

10620
08:12:30,500 --> 08:12:31,740
Like, you don't need to hit people.

10621
08:12:32,720 --> 08:12:33,460
And he's like, what?

10622
08:12:33,760 --> 08:12:33,820
No!

10623
08:12:33,820 --> 08:12:34,360
I'm scared.

10624
08:12:35,000 --> 08:12:37,800
He didn't know that his character had splash damage.

10625
08:12:38,100 --> 08:12:39,020
I'm banning Hawkeye.

10626
08:12:40,680 --> 08:12:42,040
Get Hawkeye out of there.

10627
08:12:42,340 --> 08:12:43,240
Get Hawkeye out.

10628
08:12:44,840 --> 08:12:45,440
I'm...

10629
08:12:45,440 --> 08:12:46,120
I'm...

10630
08:12:46,120 --> 08:12:48,180
I'm worried.

10631
08:12:48,920 --> 08:12:50,780
I'm worried we're gonna let Misogynist win.

10632
08:12:51,920 --> 08:12:52,900
Guys, no.

10633
08:12:53,100 --> 08:12:54,120
No, it's not gonna happen.

10634
08:12:55,400 --> 08:12:56,940
You better have good accuracy.

10635
08:12:57,940 --> 08:13:00,120
I'm worried it's gonna happen.

10636
08:13:00,220 --> 08:13:03,100
You better have a better than 40% accuracy.

10637
08:13:05,420 --> 08:13:07,520
Don't want him to think he was wrong earlier.

10638
08:13:08,160 --> 08:13:10,120
Oh, we have three support players.

10639
08:13:10,520 --> 08:13:12,920
Well, one of you guys better go tank, I guess.

10640
08:13:13,580 --> 08:13:15,020
I'm making Medic go tank.

10641
08:13:19,840 --> 08:13:21,180
I don't think...

10642
08:13:24,340 --> 08:13:24,940
Unfortunate.

10643
08:13:24,940 --> 08:13:25,540
Allegedly.

10644
08:13:26,440 --> 08:13:27,040
Allegedly.

10645
08:13:28,200 --> 08:13:29,980
We have the mental boom improving.

10646
08:13:30,360 --> 08:13:31,520
We have...

10647
08:13:31,520 --> 08:13:32,800
Yo, guys, hear me out.

10648
08:13:32,960 --> 08:13:34,160
Honestly, we have three supports.

10649
08:13:34,280 --> 08:13:35,480
Let's just fucking go goats.

10650
08:13:38,000 --> 08:13:39,040
Just go goats.

10651
08:13:39,180 --> 08:13:40,180
What's the worst that could happen?

10652
08:13:40,420 --> 08:13:46,580
It goes for this game, it's like two tanks and one DPS.

10653
08:13:47,320 --> 08:13:50,740
Guys, I don't think Medic wants to go.

10654
08:13:52,020 --> 08:13:52,940
He'll do it.

10655
08:13:54,380 --> 08:13:54,960
I don't mind.

10656
08:13:55,080 --> 08:13:56,280
I guess we just run.

10657
08:13:58,820 --> 08:13:59,660
He'll fold.

10658
08:14:00,080 --> 08:14:01,180
Oh, he's not folding.

10659
08:14:01,580 --> 08:14:02,420
He's not folding.

10660
08:14:03,620 --> 08:14:06,100
He's not folding.

10661
08:14:07,020 --> 08:14:08,380
He's not folding.

10662
08:14:10,040 --> 08:14:12,220
I don't think you understand.

10663
08:14:12,980 --> 08:14:14,160
We need a tank.

10664
08:14:15,480 --> 08:14:20,960
He says we need a tank and stays Iron Man?

10665
08:14:21,140 --> 08:14:22,560
No, no, that was Doctor.

10666
08:14:23,520 --> 08:14:24,780
Oh, thank God.

10667
08:14:24,840 --> 08:14:26,940
I was gonna freak out.

10668
08:14:27,000 --> 08:14:29,860
I was actually gonna freak out.

10669
08:14:30,800 --> 08:14:31,920
Oh, they got...

10670
08:14:31,920 --> 08:14:33,880
Okay, now we extra gotta win this game.

10671
08:14:34,100 --> 08:14:35,300
They got the homies.

10672
08:14:36,880 --> 08:14:39,540
Well, the homies has an actual team comp.

10673
08:14:42,240 --> 08:14:43,660
Homies run RNG.

10674
08:14:43,880 --> 08:14:47,380
The fucking homie really wants to win.

10675
08:14:48,080 --> 08:14:50,740
Oh, hell no.

10676
08:14:50,740 --> 08:14:57,700
Yeah, like, we're keeping you alive, but like, it's definitely very difficult.

10677
08:15:01,840 --> 08:15:03,060
You're welcome.

10678
08:15:03,520 --> 08:15:04,740
Thank you.

10679
08:15:05,760 --> 08:15:08,740
By the way, I don't know...

10680
08:15:11,220 --> 08:15:15,020
You're literally in front of everybody, so...

10681
08:15:22,900 --> 08:15:24,020
The homies...

10682
08:15:24,020 --> 08:15:27,620
The homies get an actual comp, and the medic went fucking Widow.

10683
08:15:33,760 --> 08:15:35,200
That's actually crazy.

10684
08:15:36,040 --> 08:15:37,080
I think we...

10685
08:15:37,080 --> 08:15:38,220
Oh my God.

10686
08:15:38,340 --> 08:15:40,600
I mean, I can... I guess I can go tank.

10687
08:15:41,240 --> 08:15:45,780
Maybe if I flirt with the enemy team, they will let us win.

10688
08:15:46,440 --> 08:15:47,860
I don't...

10689
08:15:47,860 --> 08:15:49,300
Yeah, you know what?

10690
08:15:50,040 --> 08:15:51,520
You think my plan sucks?

10691
08:15:51,600 --> 08:15:53,800
I think your plan fucking sucks.

10692
08:15:54,200 --> 08:15:57,060
They just win.

10693
08:15:58,560 --> 08:15:59,260
That's okay.

10694
08:15:59,780 --> 08:16:01,540
You're not getting healed, by the way, Mac.

10695
08:16:02,180 --> 08:16:02,640
Woohoo!

10696
08:16:05,380 --> 08:16:10,680
We might have three healers, but one of them is a fucking raccoon.

10697
08:16:11,200 --> 08:16:13,440
That's a huge ult, but we can't do anything about it.

10698
08:16:14,100 --> 08:16:14,460
Ow.

10699
08:16:16,300 --> 08:16:18,680
That was actually a huge ult, but we just can't do anything about it.

10700
08:16:21,880 --> 08:16:23,760
You're being blocked by everything.

10701
08:16:27,400 --> 08:16:30,340
I froze... Oh my God, I got knocked everywhere.

10702
08:16:31,880 --> 08:16:32,620
Alright, it's time.

10703
08:16:32,680 --> 08:16:33,580
I'm pulling up the Magneto.

10704
08:16:33,720 --> 08:16:34,220
It's time.

10705
08:16:36,160 --> 08:16:37,260
Alright, important question.

10706
08:16:37,320 --> 08:16:39,000
Do I start flaming, even though it's Christmas?

10707
08:16:39,180 --> 08:16:40,820
Bro, you are not a Widow main.

10708
08:16:40,900 --> 08:16:41,760
I pointed it out to you yesterday.

10709
08:16:41,980 --> 08:16:42,940
You're a Punisher one trick.

10710
08:16:43,520 --> 08:16:44,060
Allegedly.

10711
08:16:44,240 --> 08:16:46,260
Who didn't know that his turret had AOE?

10712
08:16:46,880 --> 08:16:47,580
It's time.

10713
08:16:48,200 --> 08:16:50,980
I just don't even know how some people get to this point.

10714
08:16:51,680 --> 08:16:52,040
Oh!

10715
08:16:52,680 --> 08:16:55,280
Oh my God, he doesn't even know who you fucking are!

10716
08:16:55,840 --> 08:16:57,500
That's fucking crazy!

10717
08:16:58,860 --> 08:17:01,060
That's actually crazy!

10718
08:17:04,900 --> 08:17:06,620
Oh my God!

10719
08:17:08,900 --> 08:17:09,340
Ow.

10720
08:17:13,700 --> 08:17:18,280
Remember when we asked for more support players, and then we ended up getting... Oh my God.

10721
08:17:22,860 --> 08:17:23,740
It's okay.

10722
08:17:23,960 --> 08:17:24,420
Can we kill this one?

10723
08:17:24,440 --> 08:17:25,780
I'm okay with this game.

10724
08:17:28,640 --> 08:17:32,100
For some reason, I thought I was healer, so I tried to shoot our Raccoon.

10725
08:17:34,340 --> 08:17:36,920
This guy just burped in BC.

10726
08:17:37,480 --> 08:17:39,140
Oh my God.

10727
08:17:40,440 --> 08:17:41,080
That's...

10728
08:17:41,080 --> 08:17:42,200
What a gamer.

10729
08:17:45,560 --> 08:17:47,160
Oh my God.

10730
08:17:47,340 --> 08:17:48,920
Yo, FenixMelo dies!

10731
08:17:49,640 --> 08:17:51,780
We can forfeit.

10732
08:17:52,080 --> 08:17:53,000
Maybe if we forfeit...

10733
08:17:53,000 --> 08:17:54,040
No, no, no, no, no.

10734
08:17:54,100 --> 08:17:56,340
We lack the fucking...

10735
08:17:56,340 --> 08:17:58,460
Guys, we have four bits.

10736
08:17:59,040 --> 08:17:59,640
I have all of them.

10737
08:18:02,040 --> 08:18:03,000
Oh no!

10738
08:18:05,900 --> 08:18:06,600
Oh no!

10739
08:18:10,660 --> 08:18:11,140
Alright.

10740
08:18:16,640 --> 08:18:18,640
Alright, I don't know where the arm went.

10741
08:18:20,380 --> 08:18:22,960
Well, I don't know who you're telling that to, because it's definitely not me.

10742
08:18:24,020 --> 08:18:25,280
I'm fucking thinking.

10743
08:18:31,060 --> 08:18:33,580
We are not letting FenixMelo get out of here.

10744
08:18:33,820 --> 08:18:34,980
He's getting out of here.

10745
08:18:35,080 --> 08:18:35,460
I'm sorry.

10746
08:18:35,620 --> 08:18:36,940
No, FenixMelo dies.

10747
08:18:37,060 --> 08:18:38,160
I don't know what to tell you.

10748
08:18:38,820 --> 08:18:40,540
FenixMelo's gonna die right now.

10749
08:18:42,100 --> 08:18:42,660
Get fucked.

10750
08:18:43,060 --> 08:18:43,800
Wait, I got you.

10751
08:18:45,480 --> 08:18:47,000
I got you.

10752
08:18:48,020 --> 08:18:49,520
I held right click so good.

10753
08:18:51,740 --> 08:18:52,160
I'm ulting.

10754
08:18:53,180 --> 08:18:55,040
I don't have shield for you.

10755
08:18:55,260 --> 08:18:56,140
Guys, I'm kiting.

10756
08:18:56,140 --> 08:18:58,040
Oh my god.

10757
08:18:58,180 --> 08:18:59,740
I was trying to wait for the shield.

10758
08:19:00,920 --> 08:19:03,020
I'm blocking as much as I can.

10759
08:19:04,260 --> 08:19:05,320
Wait a second.

10760
08:19:05,840 --> 08:19:07,240
No, that would be stupid.

10761
08:19:08,480 --> 08:19:12,320
Okay, I was gonna say I'm blocking too,

10762
08:19:15,960 --> 08:19:16,520
but...

10763
08:19:16,520 --> 08:19:17,960
Oh, he's so low.

10764
08:19:18,120 --> 08:19:18,960
They're so low.

10765
08:19:20,240 --> 08:19:20,800
Wait.

10766
08:19:22,740 --> 08:19:23,720
Fuck, he's low too.

10767
08:19:23,720 --> 08:19:25,620
I'm fucking... I'm going for it.

10768
08:19:25,660 --> 08:19:26,800
Oh, he's so low.

10769
08:19:29,520 --> 08:19:29,980
Groot's one.

10770
08:19:34,080 --> 08:19:35,440
He's boxing himself in.

10771
08:19:36,020 --> 08:19:36,360
Nice.

10772
08:19:38,860 --> 08:19:40,980
I don't know if we should push up that much.

10773
08:19:41,160 --> 08:19:43,480
I don't think we should push up.

10774
08:19:45,520 --> 08:19:47,720
I don't have shield too, so...

10775
08:19:47,720 --> 08:19:48,320
Okay.

10776
08:19:52,400 --> 08:19:52,840
Alright.

10777
08:19:53,780 --> 08:19:55,360
They have eye, by the way.

10778
08:19:55,720 --> 08:19:57,220
At best, I can try and shield too.

10779
08:19:58,380 --> 08:19:58,980
I got a pick.

10780
08:20:01,780 --> 08:20:02,860
What's going on back there?

10781
08:20:03,980 --> 08:20:04,280
Alright.

10782
08:20:10,070 --> 08:20:10,510
Alright.

10783
08:20:12,390 --> 08:20:13,430
I don't have a Star Lord ult.

10784
08:20:13,950 --> 08:20:14,370
I'm going.

10785
08:20:16,190 --> 08:20:16,630
No!

10786
08:20:16,630 --> 08:20:17,210
No!

10787
08:20:17,610 --> 08:20:19,730
Oh my god, I saw that.

10788
08:20:20,070 --> 08:20:23,230
That was gonna be the best ult of all time too.

10789
08:20:23,850 --> 08:20:25,430
No, he dodged it.

10790
08:20:25,910 --> 08:20:27,670
Wait, he's so low.

10791
08:20:29,130 --> 08:20:29,710
Nice.

10792
08:20:32,310 --> 08:20:34,250
Keep shooting, keep fucking hitting.

10793
08:20:34,290 --> 08:20:35,090
Okay, I kind of went crazy.

10794
08:20:37,110 --> 08:20:37,850
Oh my god.

10795
08:20:37,870 --> 08:20:41,690
You went crazy there.

10796
08:20:43,250 --> 08:20:44,290
Oh my god.

10797
08:20:44,290 --> 08:20:45,370
I have no idea what I'm doing.

10798
08:20:46,290 --> 08:20:47,330
I'm just...

10799
08:20:47,330 --> 08:20:48,510
I'm clicking buttons.

10800
08:20:48,990 --> 08:20:52,030
Chat, there's an F key, so they don't hear me sometimes.

10801
08:20:52,170 --> 08:20:52,770
That's okay.

10802
08:20:57,250 --> 08:20:58,670
Alright, this is fine.

10803
08:21:00,370 --> 08:21:00,830
Nice.

10804
08:21:02,050 --> 08:21:02,770
Nuh-uh.

10805
08:21:03,830 --> 08:21:05,310
I don't wanna...

10806
08:21:05,310 --> 08:21:05,990
He's aiming for me.

10807
08:21:08,250 --> 08:21:09,190
Oh my god.

10808
08:21:09,190 --> 08:21:09,750
Oh my god.

10809
08:21:17,910 --> 08:21:19,850
Oh, it's gigantic.

10810
08:21:20,110 --> 08:21:22,310
Oh my god, I'm him.

10811
08:21:27,050 --> 08:21:28,850
Yes, I'm okay.

10812
08:21:29,090 --> 08:21:30,330
I'm okay.

10813
08:21:30,650 --> 08:21:32,210
Alright, looks like we're about to have a couple.

10814
08:21:32,430 --> 08:21:32,530
Bro.

10815
08:21:32,810 --> 08:21:36,390
I don't know what I'm doing.

10816
08:21:37,530 --> 08:21:39,590
I don't know what I'm doing.

10817
08:21:40,450 --> 08:21:40,950
I don't know what I'm doing.

10818
08:21:40,950 --> 08:21:42,370
I'm just pressing buttons.

10819
08:21:43,970 --> 08:21:45,710
You're being greedy, trying to farm my ult.

10820
08:21:48,050 --> 08:21:49,110
I have shield.

10821
08:21:49,550 --> 08:21:52,890
I'm gonna give it to you now, just in case.

10822
08:21:53,410 --> 08:21:53,830
Oh!

10823
08:21:54,350 --> 08:21:55,830
Let me know when your next shield's up, and I'm gonna ult.

10824
08:21:56,590 --> 08:21:57,530
12 seconds, 12 seconds.

10825
08:21:58,010 --> 08:21:58,390
Watch out.

10826
08:22:00,650 --> 08:22:01,270
Fuck you, Zed.

10827
08:22:02,990 --> 08:22:03,910
I have it, one.

10828
08:22:03,910 --> 08:22:04,650
I have it, one.

10829
08:22:05,230 --> 08:22:05,730
Okay, I'm going.

10830
08:22:07,430 --> 08:22:08,570
I got you.

10831
08:22:13,110 --> 08:22:15,130
I'm trying to... got him.

10832
08:22:15,890 --> 08:22:16,890
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

10833
08:22:17,170 --> 08:22:19,290
Oh my god, what the fuck?

10834
08:22:20,050 --> 08:22:21,590
Can we push this far, though?

10835
08:22:22,590 --> 08:22:23,190
We're talented.

10836
08:22:26,250 --> 08:22:28,030
Oh my god.

10837
08:22:28,670 --> 08:22:30,430
Time to switch things up.

10838
08:22:30,810 --> 08:22:32,550
You did a troll.

10839
08:22:33,590 --> 08:22:35,290
Like the whole first half of the game.

10840
08:22:35,590 --> 08:22:36,270
What the fuck?

10841
08:22:36,310 --> 08:22:37,210
Who fucking me?

10842
08:22:38,170 --> 08:22:39,790
No, no, no, I'm better.

10843
08:22:40,550 --> 08:22:41,530
Okay, I'm better, okay.

10844
08:22:42,570 --> 08:22:43,050
Alright.

10845
08:22:44,070 --> 08:22:44,730
I was gonna say.

10846
08:22:46,490 --> 08:22:48,330
I fucking worked so hard for this.

10847
08:22:49,690 --> 08:22:50,490
What did they say?

10848
08:22:50,510 --> 08:22:51,570
You win, Black Widow.

10849
08:22:51,710 --> 08:22:52,890
I don't even want to hear it.

10850
08:22:54,010 --> 08:22:55,730
Don't antagonize him, please!

10851
08:22:58,950 --> 08:22:59,450
Don't antagonize him, please!

10852
08:22:59,450 --> 08:22:59,830
No, I know.

10853
08:23:00,370 --> 08:23:01,270
He's just talking.

10854
08:23:01,490 --> 08:23:02,710
Talking some crazy shit.

10855
08:23:05,650 --> 08:23:07,430
Don't antagonize him, please!

10856
08:23:08,790 --> 08:23:13,630
I mean, I guess it'll be a good Christmas day with someone trying to, you know, cause some problems.

10857
08:23:14,010 --> 08:23:16,470
Bro, what's wrong with you?

10858
08:23:16,530 --> 08:23:17,990
What the fuck is wrong with you?

10859
08:23:19,570 --> 08:23:20,630
What's Christmas about?

10860
08:23:26,190 --> 08:23:28,270
My brother, it's about God.

10861
08:23:28,990 --> 08:23:31,830
If you ain't celebrating God, you're not doing it right.

10862
08:23:35,510 --> 08:23:36,470
Worship him.

10863
08:23:40,510 --> 08:23:46,430
I'm turning into a fucking priest mid-game to try to keep this guy's sanity intact, bro.

10864
08:23:48,330 --> 08:23:51,950
Yo, I'm making a portal.

10865
08:23:52,830 --> 08:23:53,190
Okay.

10866
08:23:53,190 --> 08:23:53,650
Oh, fuck.

10867
08:23:57,390 --> 08:23:58,270
Worship God.

10868
08:23:58,730 --> 08:23:59,450
Yo, they have a Luna?

10869
08:23:59,770 --> 08:24:01,350
Yo, I'm gonna jump scare this Luna, okay?

10870
08:24:02,310 --> 08:24:03,410
What the fuck is this?

10871
08:24:03,550 --> 08:24:04,150
Where am I?

10872
08:24:04,370 --> 08:24:04,930
Oh, I'm dead.

10873
08:24:06,610 --> 08:24:08,390
You guys took the wrong portal.

10874
08:24:08,810 --> 08:24:11,650
I jumped in your portal and you guys took the wrong portal.

10875
08:24:12,250 --> 08:24:12,990
I jumped off.

10876
08:24:13,110 --> 08:24:13,930
We're resetting.

10877
08:24:14,110 --> 08:24:17,110
We're resetting this.

10878
08:24:17,510 --> 08:24:19,710
My portal's right here and the Luna's right there.

10879
08:24:19,710 --> 08:24:20,810
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10880
08:24:20,810 --> 08:24:22,710
That is so easy to see.

10881
08:24:24,650 --> 08:24:28,690
Wait, you guys actually...

10882
08:24:30,510 --> 08:24:31,170
That's two.

10883
08:24:31,230 --> 08:24:31,810
That's two picks.

10884
08:24:32,250 --> 08:24:32,890
You're up one.

10885
08:24:35,770 --> 08:24:36,830
You're literally up one.

10886
08:24:36,910 --> 08:24:37,950
I'm going from main.

10887
08:24:38,930 --> 08:24:40,150
I didn't realize you were gonna live.

10888
08:24:40,250 --> 08:24:41,530
I fucking jumped off the point.

10889
08:24:45,490 --> 08:24:46,130
There you go.

10890
08:24:46,530 --> 08:24:48,490
I gave you a bubble to kill that one.

10891
08:24:48,490 --> 08:24:48,970
Fuck you.

10892
08:24:49,490 --> 08:24:50,690
Fuck that one guy.

10893
08:24:52,510 --> 08:24:53,290
Good bub.

10894
08:24:54,090 --> 08:24:58,490
I thought that you guys are all gonna die so I just jumped off.

10895
08:24:58,830 --> 08:25:01,090
I went through that portal and I was like, where am I?

10896
08:25:01,110 --> 08:25:02,090
And then I fell off the map.

10897
08:25:02,690 --> 08:25:03,450
How did you...

10898
08:25:03,990 --> 08:25:05,990
You were able to retake the portal.

10899
08:25:06,230 --> 08:25:07,250
I was gonna be like...

10900
08:25:07,250 --> 08:25:09,870
I just didn't even process where that portal dropped me.

10901
08:25:09,930 --> 08:25:11,950
I was still looking around, taking in the scenery.

10902
08:25:17,350 --> 08:25:19,730
I'm playing above him right now.

10903
08:25:20,290 --> 08:25:22,230
Yeah, I gave you a bubble just in case.

10904
08:25:23,730 --> 08:25:24,730
I'm just being a bastard.

10905
08:25:24,910 --> 08:25:25,350
There's a bunch of them.

10906
08:25:26,090 --> 08:25:27,270
I'm out of gas!

10907
08:25:28,170 --> 08:25:29,170
That's bad.

10908
08:25:33,510 --> 08:25:34,590
I need a bubble.

10909
08:25:36,390 --> 08:25:36,550
Okay.

10910
08:25:41,090 --> 08:25:41,490
Ow.

10911
08:25:42,290 --> 08:25:43,530
Oh my god.

10912
08:25:44,350 --> 08:25:45,710
What's going on?

10913
08:25:45,750 --> 08:25:46,700
I can't tell.

10914
08:25:48,120 --> 08:25:49,100
Runes in a corner.

10915
08:25:49,260 --> 08:25:50,040
He built a house.

10916
08:25:50,720 --> 08:25:51,560
He's dead.

10917
08:25:53,600 --> 08:25:54,600
He's dead though.

10918
08:25:54,620 --> 08:25:55,660
I got ripped to death.

10919
08:25:58,720 --> 08:25:59,920
Oh my god.

10920
08:26:01,280 --> 08:26:02,140
It's fine.

10921
08:26:03,460 --> 08:26:04,200
I'm fucking...

10922
08:26:04,200 --> 08:26:05,460
I'm doing this.

10923
08:26:07,180 --> 08:26:08,640
Okay, I forced Luna ult.

10924
08:26:08,720 --> 08:26:09,500
I forced Luna ult.

10925
08:26:09,820 --> 08:26:13,960
I was not gonna hit that shot but he still ulted.

10926
08:26:13,960 --> 08:26:15,540
Here, I gave you...

10927
08:26:15,540 --> 08:26:16,720
Let me know when you're ulting.

10928
08:26:17,540 --> 08:26:18,060
Not yet.

10929
08:26:18,220 --> 08:26:20,860
I got you.

10930
08:26:21,320 --> 08:26:23,400
I'm gonna fucking shit myself.

10931
08:26:25,660 --> 08:26:28,100
I don't have another bubble so good luck.

10932
08:26:30,340 --> 08:26:31,720
At best I can do this.

10933
08:26:35,920 --> 08:26:37,640
Focus so fucking low, bro.

10934
08:26:37,780 --> 08:26:39,720
Oh, I'm fucking... I'm so low too.

10935
08:26:41,020 --> 08:26:41,580
Focus low.

10936
08:26:41,580 --> 08:26:42,440
Close low.

10937
08:26:43,380 --> 08:26:43,980
Nice.

10938
08:26:48,740 --> 08:26:50,540
I'm just playing on this.

10939
08:26:51,720 --> 08:26:53,960
I'm on the strange right now.

10940
08:26:54,800 --> 08:26:55,680
No, I'm dead.

10941
08:26:55,760 --> 08:26:56,680
I couldn't get in the puddle.

10942
08:26:57,700 --> 08:27:01,040
Bro, I'm fucking 1v1ing this fucking strange and he's whipping my ass.

10943
08:27:05,080 --> 08:27:07,560
He's like whipping my ass right now.

10944
08:27:07,560 --> 08:27:08,680
Oh.

10945
08:27:10,600 --> 08:27:11,420
Okay, sorry.

10946
08:27:11,540 --> 08:27:13,000
I blocked it for myself.

10947
08:27:15,340 --> 08:27:16,140
Oh my god.

10948
08:27:16,260 --> 08:27:17,840
I go away now.

10949
08:27:17,980 --> 08:27:18,860
I go away.

10950
08:27:23,780 --> 08:27:24,980
There's a...

10951
08:27:24,980 --> 08:27:26,040
He's right up here.

10952
08:27:29,600 --> 08:27:30,700
He's up there.

10953
08:27:31,140 --> 08:27:32,500
He's just chilling up there.

10954
08:27:37,860 --> 08:27:38,600
Oh my god.

10955
08:27:38,760 --> 08:27:39,860
My hands.

10956
08:27:40,740 --> 08:27:42,700
I didn't know you could stand up here.

10957
08:27:42,780 --> 08:27:43,800
But the guys won.

10958
08:27:46,920 --> 08:27:48,940
Okay, I don't know if he's done anything.

10959
08:27:52,740 --> 08:27:53,620
I'm just...

10960
08:27:53,620 --> 08:27:54,020
Alright.

10961
08:27:55,060 --> 08:27:55,880
I have ult though.

10962
08:27:56,180 --> 08:27:56,640
Is it worth it?

10963
08:27:56,640 --> 08:27:57,720
I have a really good ult cooking up.

10964
08:27:58,740 --> 08:27:59,500
Is it worth it?

10965
08:27:59,540 --> 08:28:00,220
I can ult too.

10966
08:28:00,220 --> 08:28:00,360
Oh.

10967
08:28:04,640 --> 08:28:06,080
Oh my god.

10968
08:28:06,300 --> 08:28:06,580
No.

10969
08:28:08,420 --> 08:28:09,360
I have ult for next.

10970
08:28:11,300 --> 08:28:12,240
Oh my god.

10971
08:28:12,560 --> 08:28:13,840
Fucking strange.

10972
08:28:15,100 --> 08:28:15,920
I have bubble.

10973
08:28:15,960 --> 08:28:16,740
I have bubble for you.

10974
08:28:19,740 --> 08:28:20,600
Fuck you.

10975
08:28:21,520 --> 08:28:23,340
Okay, you know what?

10976
08:28:23,740 --> 08:28:25,640
I don't know what I'm doing, but it's fine.

10977
08:28:31,260 --> 08:28:32,740
I'm gonna push the cart.

10978
08:28:32,960 --> 08:28:33,780
I'm gonna be a cart bitch.

10979
08:28:35,580 --> 08:28:36,900
I'm running it down.

10980
08:28:40,580 --> 08:28:42,500
I am gonna be a cart bitch.

10981
08:28:42,580 --> 08:28:43,660
Our healers are not here.

10982
08:28:44,220 --> 08:28:45,300
Wait, there's a... Okay.

10983
08:28:48,100 --> 08:28:49,740
I bubble you just in case.

10984
08:28:51,640 --> 08:28:52,840
This guy wants a Starlord gel.

10985
08:28:53,780 --> 08:28:54,300
Insta diff.

10986
08:28:54,420 --> 08:28:55,940
Okay, I'm coming pushing up with you.

10987
08:29:01,450 --> 08:29:02,090
Nice.

10988
08:29:02,750 --> 08:29:03,950
Just in case.

10989
08:29:06,430 --> 08:29:07,070
Nice.

10990
08:29:08,390 --> 08:29:10,570
I'm pushing cart a bit with our team.

10991
08:29:11,910 --> 08:29:13,190
Oh no.

10992
08:29:15,990 --> 08:29:17,210
You're back though.

10993
08:29:20,030 --> 08:29:20,830
Luna's one!

10994
08:29:20,950 --> 08:29:21,370
Luna's one!

10995
08:29:21,950 --> 08:29:23,290
Oh my god.

10996
08:29:23,390 --> 08:29:24,030
She's actually one.

10997
08:29:24,070 --> 08:29:24,630
I'm bubbling you.

10998
08:29:24,630 --> 08:29:26,370
I'm gonna double kill now.

10999
08:29:27,010 --> 08:29:28,910
They have strange ult.

11000
08:29:29,970 --> 08:29:31,370
I can try to shield it.

11001
08:29:32,150 --> 08:29:33,250
I'm trying to whip him.

11002
08:29:33,330 --> 08:29:34,310
I'm whipping him too.

11003
08:29:34,830 --> 08:29:35,970
Oh my god!

11004
08:29:37,490 --> 08:29:39,130
Oh my god!

11005
08:29:39,950 --> 08:29:41,130
Oh my god!

11006
08:29:41,330 --> 08:29:43,630
Oh my god!

11007
08:29:44,290 --> 08:29:45,790
There's no way!

11008
08:29:46,510 --> 08:29:47,910
There's no way!

11009
08:29:50,290 --> 08:29:52,650
100% win rate Magneto.

11010
08:29:52,650 --> 08:29:53,830
Oh my god!

11011
08:29:57,810 --> 08:29:58,850
Misogyny defeated!

11012
08:29:59,170 --> 08:30:00,670
We defeated Misogyny!

11013
08:30:03,090 --> 08:30:05,390
I got 18 for that?

11014
08:30:05,530 --> 08:30:06,530
I got 17.

11015
08:30:06,710 --> 08:30:08,990
That was not a 17 point game.

11016
08:30:09,110 --> 08:30:10,530
From how much... I'm avoiding medic.

11017
08:30:10,650 --> 08:30:11,110
I'll do it.

11018
08:30:11,210 --> 08:30:12,610
I'll fucking... I have...

11019
08:30:12,610 --> 08:30:13,870
I don't think I'm drunk.

11020
08:30:13,950 --> 08:30:14,510
He's still playing.

11021
08:30:14,630 --> 08:30:15,030
There's no way.

11022
08:30:15,050 --> 08:30:16,510
It's like he's passed out after drinking.

11023
08:30:20,830 --> 08:30:22,150
Oh my god.

11024
08:30:22,490 --> 08:30:23,930
Who do I have to avoid?

11025
08:30:24,070 --> 08:30:25,690
It's actually a Christmas miracle.

11026
08:30:25,870 --> 08:30:27,690
I avoided the medic lolikid.

11027
08:30:28,230 --> 08:30:30,010
Is there anyone that I need to get?

11028
08:30:30,470 --> 08:30:31,970
Do what you feel like.

11029
08:30:32,130 --> 08:30:32,990
Do what your heart desires.

11030
08:30:33,970 --> 08:30:36,370
I'm gonna actually use the bathroom I did in last time.

11031
08:30:36,430 --> 08:30:37,110
I just got water.

11032
08:30:38,850 --> 08:30:39,730
You lied.

11033
08:30:42,290 --> 08:30:46,150
Why is the avoidance teammate so out of the way?

11034
08:30:51,780 --> 08:30:56,460
Okay, now that Doki's in the bathroom, we should get five gifted subs to farm Valorant out of their money.

11035
08:30:57,800 --> 08:30:59,460
Also, I have no slots.

11036
08:31:00,080 --> 08:31:04,660
I just have Mikipoo, VivaPalestina, and Provy.

11037
08:31:06,800 --> 08:31:08,460
Pretty stacked avoid list.

11038
08:31:51,950 --> 08:31:54,070
That was such a hard game.

11039
08:31:56,130 --> 08:31:58,390
We both had to go tank.

11040
08:31:59,310 --> 08:32:01,010
Oh my god, chat.

11041
08:32:01,070 --> 08:32:05,490
That was actually crazy.

11042
08:32:06,530 --> 08:32:07,290
We won though.

11043
08:32:07,390 --> 08:32:09,790
You have 100% winrate on Magneto now.

11044
08:32:10,070 --> 08:32:11,270
I can't believe.

11045
08:32:11,990 --> 08:32:14,830
I can't believe I won a game on tank.

11046
08:32:15,150 --> 08:32:20,530
I literally never used a bubble on myself and I literally just bubbled Mac the entire time.

11047
08:32:20,530 --> 08:32:23,950
I feel like Mac just took...

11048
08:32:23,950 --> 08:32:25,930
I was like, okay, here's a bubble for Mac.

11049
08:32:26,030 --> 08:32:27,350
Here's another bubble for Mac.

11050
08:32:27,450 --> 08:32:29,870
Here's one for Ruben.

11051
08:32:29,990 --> 08:32:31,110
Just for good luck.

11052
08:32:32,010 --> 08:32:34,030
I feel like Magneto is pretty easy to get a hang of.

11053
08:32:34,210 --> 08:32:36,770
You just, you know, you just press his buttons.

11054
08:32:37,150 --> 08:32:38,110
Yeah, literally, that's what I did.

11055
08:32:38,170 --> 08:32:39,830
I just pressed his buttons on repeat.

11056
08:32:42,030 --> 08:32:43,310
Oh my god, we have a tank player.

11057
08:32:43,430 --> 08:32:45,290
We have an actual tank player.

11058
08:32:45,390 --> 08:32:47,410
We have a Magneto hero portrait.

11059
08:32:48,190 --> 08:32:51,430
He also has a board portrait for Strange.

11060
08:32:52,890 --> 08:32:55,070
Oh my god, he's an actual tank tank player.

11061
08:32:58,250 --> 08:33:00,110
Does somebody want to play Magneto?

11062
08:33:01,170 --> 08:33:04,450
He asked for all the DPS players.

11063
08:33:09,070 --> 08:33:09,830
Man.

11064
08:33:11,150 --> 08:33:13,630
They're just target banning you.

11065
08:33:15,090 --> 08:33:16,230
Okay, Hawkeye?

11066
08:33:16,510 --> 08:33:19,630
I guess my Starlord has rapidly become my best character.

11067
08:33:20,750 --> 08:33:23,770
According to just everyone who's suddenly target banning me.

11068
08:33:24,090 --> 08:33:27,870
I've never seen anyone ban Starlord, besides now.

11069
08:33:28,350 --> 08:33:28,670
Yeah.

11070
08:33:31,430 --> 08:33:35,170
You literally must have pulled up your stream and just saw all the Starlords.

11071
08:33:36,030 --> 08:33:37,570
That's basically it.

11072
08:33:38,110 --> 08:33:38,850
Hawkeye's no issue.

11073
08:33:39,410 --> 08:33:40,630
Pick your hero.

11074
08:33:41,510 --> 08:33:43,850
Did he just say Hawkeye is not an issue?

11075
08:33:44,070 --> 08:33:46,290
What the fuck is wrong with you and what queues were you in?

11076
08:33:48,230 --> 08:33:52,190
Okay, I like this.

11077
08:33:54,430 --> 08:33:55,230
It's alright.

11078
08:34:00,610 --> 08:34:03,150
I can't believe we made it this far, chat.

11079
08:34:03,470 --> 08:34:06,930
We actually won our first GM.

11080
08:34:06,930 --> 08:34:10,010
The fact that it was a GM tank game and we won.

11081
08:34:10,110 --> 08:34:12,690
Like, what?

11082
08:34:14,290 --> 08:34:17,370
We actually won a GM tank game.

11083
08:34:17,450 --> 08:34:19,250
That's actually fucking crazy.

11084
08:34:19,950 --> 08:34:21,310
I have good frames.

11085
08:34:21,990 --> 08:34:23,010
It's meant to be.

11086
08:34:23,610 --> 08:34:26,550
I wish this game got like 600 FPS, bro.

11087
08:34:27,150 --> 08:34:28,290
Dude, I'm told.

11088
08:34:29,910 --> 08:34:32,350
I try not to stream.

11089
08:34:32,350 --> 08:34:36,070
I don't like streaming Marble Rivals that much just because my frames drop too.

11090
08:34:36,630 --> 08:34:38,270
I haven't played it without streaming yet.

11091
08:34:38,530 --> 08:34:41,430
I get like 240 to like 300 while streaming.

11092
08:34:41,430 --> 08:34:44,810
When I stream, I get like 200, but sometimes it drops to 100.

11093
08:34:45,410 --> 08:34:46,950
But it's not like often.

11094
08:34:47,610 --> 08:34:51,570
It's just hanging around 100 in the middle of a fight.

11095
08:34:51,650 --> 08:34:52,730
It's really annoying.

11096
08:34:53,130 --> 08:34:56,110
Oh, if a strange portal opens, my shit goes double digits sometimes.

11097
08:34:56,450 --> 08:34:57,210
Oh, fuck.

11098
08:34:57,610 --> 08:34:59,050
Alright, I put it on you, Ruben.

11099
08:34:59,230 --> 08:35:00,470
You better impress me.

11100
08:35:00,550 --> 08:35:02,250
I'm gonna Pug Champ all over the place.

11101
08:35:03,030 --> 08:35:03,950
You better...

11102
08:35:03,950 --> 08:35:04,350
Oh.

11103
08:35:05,770 --> 08:35:07,850
Oh, we forgot about...

11104
08:35:07,850 --> 08:35:09,150
I'm just gonna shrug them early.

11105
08:35:09,430 --> 08:35:11,550
We forgot to ban Hulk.

11106
08:35:11,870 --> 08:35:13,670
We forgot our one rule.

11107
08:35:15,730 --> 08:35:16,050
Luna one.

11108
08:35:16,130 --> 08:35:16,410
Luna one.

11109
08:35:16,510 --> 08:35:16,750
Luna one.

11110
08:35:18,930 --> 08:35:19,850
Luna's so low.

11111
08:35:20,310 --> 08:35:20,750
Mag.

11112
08:35:21,170 --> 08:35:21,630
Mag.

11113
08:35:21,730 --> 08:35:21,870
Mag.

11114
08:35:21,970 --> 08:35:22,090
Mag.

11115
08:35:23,150 --> 08:35:23,630
Hulk one.

11116
08:35:23,990 --> 08:35:24,670
Ironman one.

11117
08:35:24,710 --> 08:35:25,330
Ironman one too.

11118
08:35:25,430 --> 08:35:26,230
Ironman's so low.

11119
08:35:26,670 --> 08:35:28,010
Wow, he was literally one.

11120
08:35:29,050 --> 08:35:29,670
Mag low.

11121
08:35:29,750 --> 08:35:30,030
Mag low.

11122
08:35:30,030 --> 08:35:30,850
They have no healers.

11123
08:35:30,890 --> 08:35:31,050
Go.

11124
08:35:31,150 --> 08:35:31,170
Go.

11125
08:35:31,290 --> 08:35:31,350
Go.

11126
08:35:31,710 --> 08:35:32,070
Go.

11127
08:35:32,390 --> 08:35:32,390
Go.

11128
08:35:32,710 --> 08:35:32,790
Go.

11129
08:35:32,790 --> 08:35:32,850
Go.

11130
08:35:32,850 --> 08:35:32,890
Hulk.

11131
08:35:32,970 --> 08:35:32,970
Hulk.

11132
08:35:33,150 --> 08:35:33,150
Hulk.

11133
08:35:33,310 --> 08:35:33,310
Hulk.

11134
08:35:33,350 --> 08:35:34,010
Make a minion.

11135
08:35:34,130 --> 08:35:34,430
Leave him.

11136
08:35:35,270 --> 08:35:35,790
Leave him.

11137
08:35:35,930 --> 08:35:36,050
Leave him.

11138
08:35:36,110 --> 08:35:36,330
Leave him.

11139
08:35:36,350 --> 08:35:36,590
Leave him.

11140
08:35:36,870 --> 08:35:39,410
Just let him chill.

11141
08:35:39,670 --> 08:35:40,890
He's having a good time.

11142
08:35:49,230 --> 08:35:50,950
Alright, Ruben.

11143
08:35:51,130 --> 08:35:54,590
It really depends on if our tank ever takes any damage for you to get healed.

11144
08:35:55,190 --> 08:35:55,550
I bet.

11145
08:35:56,550 --> 08:35:59,130
And at the moment, he's taking zero damage.

11146
08:36:01,530 --> 08:36:02,610
I think they're gonna go hype.

11147
08:36:02,610 --> 08:36:05,790
I think it's hype is where the party's at.

11148
08:36:05,930 --> 08:36:06,370
Are they going hype?

11149
08:36:07,390 --> 08:36:08,050
Uh, yes.

11150
08:36:08,810 --> 08:36:10,050
Oh, I'm falling down.

11151
08:36:10,150 --> 08:36:10,690
I'm out of there.

11152
08:36:12,250 --> 08:36:13,190
I got you.

11153
08:36:13,250 --> 08:36:13,670
I got you.

11154
08:36:13,970 --> 08:36:14,970
Oh, he's hulking out.

11155
08:36:15,070 --> 08:36:16,090
They have a tank now.

11156
08:36:18,750 --> 08:36:19,130
Settlock.

11157
08:36:19,230 --> 08:36:19,490
Settlock.

11158
08:36:20,650 --> 08:36:21,430
I got you.

11159
08:36:23,210 --> 08:36:23,930
Hulk on point.

11160
08:36:24,090 --> 08:36:25,230
Oh, he fucking bubbled.

11161
08:36:25,370 --> 08:36:25,830
Hulk is low.

11162
08:36:25,930 --> 08:36:26,710
Hulk is half.

11163
08:36:26,810 --> 08:36:27,250
Hulk is half.

11164
08:36:27,690 --> 08:36:28,350
Hulk is right here.

11165
08:36:28,470 --> 08:36:28,830
He's half.

11166
08:36:28,910 --> 08:36:29,610
He's so low.

11167
08:36:29,830 --> 08:36:30,710
He's actually one.

11168
08:36:30,710 --> 08:36:30,990
Oh, shit.

11169
08:36:31,290 --> 08:36:33,010
Oh, huge rez.

11170
08:36:34,410 --> 08:36:35,970
I'm gonna fucking...

11171
08:36:35,970 --> 08:36:38,230
I got him out of mech.

11172
08:36:38,730 --> 08:36:39,750
Fuck you.

11173
08:36:42,500 --> 08:36:43,230
I got you.

11174
08:36:43,850 --> 08:36:45,190
I'm just killing all.

11175
08:36:48,310 --> 08:36:49,550
I got the turret.

11176
08:36:49,770 --> 08:36:50,910
I love this orb.

11177
08:36:55,280 --> 08:36:55,960
You're fine.

11178
08:36:58,670 --> 08:36:59,040
Punisher.

11179
08:36:59,540 --> 08:36:59,960
Punisher.

11180
08:36:59,960 --> 08:37:00,520
Punisher is one.

11181
08:37:01,240 --> 08:37:01,820
No more?

11182
08:37:05,580 --> 08:37:06,880
I mean, this is just great.

11183
08:37:07,480 --> 08:37:08,500
This is so nice.

11184
08:37:09,740 --> 08:37:11,680
Why can't our games be like this?

11185
08:37:12,160 --> 08:37:13,940
I'm having a great time just chilling up here.

11186
08:37:14,480 --> 08:37:16,840
Yeah, you gotta have a break after the stressful game last time.

11187
08:37:17,400 --> 08:37:20,080
Yeah, I'm stressing out playing Starlord, dashing everywhere right now.

11188
08:37:20,140 --> 08:37:21,300
I'm just vibing on a turret.

11189
08:37:22,000 --> 08:37:22,560
With a raccoon.

11190
08:37:24,940 --> 08:37:25,400
Oh, behind us.

11191
08:37:25,560 --> 08:37:25,740
Behind us.

11192
08:37:28,480 --> 08:37:29,360
Back, back, back.

11193
08:37:29,380 --> 08:37:31,100
There's a Magneto just slowly walking up.

11194
08:37:33,180 --> 08:37:36,600
Oh my god, I get to play Psylocke and do whatever I want.

11195
08:37:36,720 --> 08:37:38,180
This is so nice.

11196
08:37:41,940 --> 08:37:43,500
Oh my god.

11197
08:37:44,440 --> 08:37:45,700
I don't have to fill.

11198
08:37:45,940 --> 08:37:46,740
This is beautiful.

11199
08:37:48,420 --> 08:37:50,800
They should have both.

11200
08:37:51,060 --> 08:37:52,220
Yeah, they didn't even do anything.

11201
08:37:52,860 --> 08:37:55,640
I'm gonna pop mine and they're both gonna pop theirs.

11202
08:37:55,640 --> 08:37:57,120
Who the fuck is talking?

11203
08:37:57,560 --> 08:37:58,380
I wish I knew.

11204
08:37:58,620 --> 08:38:00,740
I wish it don't be in the top left.

11205
08:38:02,420 --> 08:38:03,560
Who are you?

11206
08:38:03,720 --> 08:38:04,520
It always happens.

11207
08:38:05,280 --> 08:38:05,960
Is it Magneto?

11208
08:38:09,060 --> 08:38:10,360
No, it's Ironfist.

11209
08:38:10,900 --> 08:38:12,300
Oh, okay.

11210
08:38:15,860 --> 08:38:17,800
This game is so buggy, bro.

11211
08:38:19,860 --> 08:38:23,380
You gotta say your name first before we know who it is.

11212
08:38:25,640 --> 08:38:26,400
I'm gonna pop my ult.

11213
08:38:26,960 --> 08:38:28,360
No, don't use everything.

11214
08:38:32,900 --> 08:38:34,420
You're making space.

11215
08:38:35,020 --> 08:38:37,020
I love having a tank player.

11216
08:38:37,640 --> 08:38:39,320
It's so nice.

11217
08:38:39,580 --> 08:38:40,400
It's so nice.

11218
08:38:40,440 --> 08:38:42,000
And he's comfy solo tanking too.

11219
08:38:42,860 --> 08:38:44,200
Yeah, he's just nice.

11220
08:38:44,760 --> 08:38:46,520
I gave him the snowflake, by the way.

11221
08:38:48,720 --> 08:38:50,520
I know where the health packs are.

11222
08:38:50,560 --> 08:38:52,360
I'm gonna break the pole in the middle.

11223
08:38:53,740 --> 08:38:54,640
Nice!

11224
08:38:55,160 --> 08:38:56,180
There's a Magneto.

11225
08:38:56,680 --> 08:38:57,400
To our right.

11226
08:39:03,370 --> 08:39:05,950
Alright, time to dance.

11227
08:39:06,170 --> 08:39:06,890
I'm dancing.

11228
08:39:09,570 --> 08:39:10,470
Okay.

11229
08:39:13,130 --> 08:39:14,930
Good luck.

11230
08:39:15,650 --> 08:39:17,190
You popped the second defensive ult.

11231
08:39:19,130 --> 08:39:20,930
I think we die here, maybe.

11232
08:39:21,610 --> 08:39:22,690
We're down.

11233
08:39:23,130 --> 08:39:24,690
Yeah, yeah, we just back up.

11234
08:39:28,690 --> 08:39:29,470
It's fine.

11235
08:39:29,710 --> 08:39:30,970
I can engage on them whenever.

11236
08:39:31,430 --> 08:39:33,630
We have max ult for...

11237
08:39:33,630 --> 08:39:34,750
and they have zero defensive ult.

11238
08:39:36,590 --> 08:39:37,290
This is it.

11239
08:39:37,350 --> 08:39:38,590
This is your time to shine.

11240
08:39:40,110 --> 08:39:42,170
I'm gonna peek and break the turret.

11241
08:39:45,370 --> 08:39:46,610
He didn't give you infinite.

11242
08:39:47,050 --> 08:39:49,850
Yeah, what else is new with these fucking Raccoon players?

11243
08:39:53,690 --> 08:39:55,450
I got one shot at him.

11244
08:39:56,450 --> 08:39:57,970
This is where I die.

11245
08:39:58,570 --> 08:40:00,390
Nope, this is where I die.

11246
08:40:01,430 --> 08:40:03,090
Not from the Psylocke ult.

11247
08:40:04,510 --> 08:40:05,290
Yo, can you play Mantis?

11248
08:40:06,690 --> 08:40:13,060
You think that Lucio would like to play Mantis?

11249
08:40:13,320 --> 08:40:14,540
Oh my god.

11250
08:40:19,880 --> 08:40:21,680
Yeah, I think they're gonna get their spoil soon.

11251
08:40:21,680 --> 08:40:22,420
Can you use Mag?

11252
08:40:23,300 --> 08:40:23,700
Rocket,

11253
08:40:29,950 --> 08:40:31,330
give me infinite here and I can push tomorrow.

11254
08:40:32,850 --> 08:40:34,290
I don't think he knows what you're talking about.

11255
08:40:34,730 --> 08:40:36,250
Oh, there he goes, there he goes.

11256
08:40:38,670 --> 08:40:40,470
We're double healing, pocketing you.

11257
08:40:44,810 --> 08:40:46,150
Mag dies, Mag dies.

11258
08:40:53,100 --> 08:40:54,280
Oh my god.

11259
08:40:54,480 --> 08:40:56,860
We got fucking...

11260
08:40:56,860 --> 08:40:59,100
I thought our Mag would bubble me next round.

11261
08:41:00,320 --> 08:41:01,220
I don't think he has it.

11262
08:41:04,200 --> 08:41:06,200
Because he bubbled himself.

11263
08:41:06,960 --> 08:41:08,720
This just wasn't our map, guys!

11264
08:41:13,480 --> 08:41:14,960
What is he saying?

11265
08:41:15,060 --> 08:41:15,600
Is Mike...

11266
08:41:15,600 --> 08:41:17,540
Sounds like he's in a submarine.

11267
08:41:21,520 --> 08:41:23,100
I think I can touch.

11268
08:41:23,800 --> 08:41:24,120
Alright.

11269
08:41:24,120 --> 08:41:24,140
Alright.

11270
08:41:25,700 --> 08:41:27,040
I don't think we should use anything.

11271
08:41:27,600 --> 08:41:30,620
Oh my god, did you get headshot there?

11272
08:41:31,440 --> 08:41:33,540
I just insta-died as soon as I touched.

11273
08:41:33,660 --> 08:41:36,100
Yeah, you got headshot, there's no way!

11274
08:41:36,900 --> 08:41:38,580
I'm like, you know, I ulted there for some reason.

11275
08:41:41,040 --> 08:41:43,080
I think after...

11276
08:41:44,200 --> 08:41:47,940
After my ult, I think I'm gonna swap because this Namor...

11277
08:41:47,940 --> 08:41:50,840
Okay, maybe that was just a really good Namor map against Psylocke.

11278
08:41:54,120 --> 08:41:56,140
Yeah, I mean our Iron Fist is just doing nothing, I think.

11279
08:42:07,420 --> 08:42:08,860
Tis the Iron Fist player.

11280
08:42:20,860 --> 08:42:22,240
That has to be our tank.

11281
08:42:24,120 --> 08:42:25,240
You can go Mantis.

11282
08:42:25,920 --> 08:42:28,560
The rocket's enabling me a bit.

11283
08:42:34,320 --> 08:42:34,920
Also,

11284
08:42:38,240 --> 08:42:41,960
I can go Buggy if Psylocke doesn't work for his fight.

11285
08:42:43,540 --> 08:42:45,040
I'm gonna follow you two.

11286
08:42:46,020 --> 08:42:46,800
Where are you going, man?

11287
08:42:47,140 --> 08:42:49,100
My Magneto's following you guys.

11288
08:42:50,600 --> 08:42:51,040
Nice.

11289
08:42:51,040 --> 08:42:53,780
They already destroyed the platform.

11290
08:42:54,820 --> 08:42:55,260
Nice.

11291
08:42:56,340 --> 08:42:57,480
Mantis, Mantis, Mantis.

11292
08:42:59,540 --> 08:43:00,460
Psylocke on the left.

11293
08:43:00,800 --> 08:43:01,160
Psylocke one.

11294
08:43:03,280 --> 08:43:04,440
Our tank is on point.

11295
08:43:05,220 --> 08:43:06,340
Namor one, Namor one.

11296
08:43:06,440 --> 08:43:07,220
Psylocke and left all.

11297
08:43:07,860 --> 08:43:09,220
I'm pushing up to you guys.

11298
08:43:10,600 --> 08:43:11,880
That was a nice blink.

11299
08:43:12,380 --> 08:43:14,720
I'm gonna hop onto it and start breaking walls.

11300
08:43:20,140 --> 08:43:22,580
Do they have Luna or Mantis ult?

11301
08:43:22,620 --> 08:43:23,100
Yes, they do.

11302
08:43:25,500 --> 08:43:27,920
You force it out and I'll use mine after.

11303
08:43:31,320 --> 08:43:32,400
You died so fast.

11304
08:43:32,460 --> 08:43:39,030
Oh my god.

11305
08:43:40,970 --> 08:43:44,350
I hope he's forcing stuff right now.

11306
08:43:46,590 --> 08:43:47,650
Punisher, Punisher.

11307
08:43:47,990 --> 08:43:48,430
Namor.

11308
08:43:49,110 --> 08:43:50,670
I froze somebody.

11309
08:43:53,470 --> 08:43:54,950
A Magneto, a Magneto one.

11310
08:43:57,750 --> 08:43:59,410
Namor's one, Namor's one, Namor's one.

11311
08:43:59,490 --> 08:44:00,270
Namor's actually one.

11312
08:44:03,130 --> 08:44:04,850
He's so low, he's actually low.

11313
08:44:05,350 --> 08:44:06,070
There we go.

11314
08:44:06,870 --> 08:44:08,770
Oh my god, I love this hero.

11315
08:44:09,210 --> 08:44:12,430
Okay, okay, okay, I don't know if we should push up so close.

11316
08:44:14,470 --> 08:44:16,590
They should still have support ult.

11317
08:44:18,590 --> 08:44:20,850
There's a Psylocke under us, I think.

11318
08:44:23,530 --> 08:44:24,530
I got you.

11319
08:44:25,570 --> 08:44:27,130
I'm backing up.

11320
08:44:28,990 --> 08:44:30,270
Where are they going?

11321
08:44:31,610 --> 08:44:33,370
They're going right side, they're going Mania.

11322
08:44:38,380 --> 08:44:39,800
I have to use this.

11323
08:44:40,260 --> 08:44:42,380
Oh, that's huge, that's huge.

11324
08:44:42,380 --> 08:44:43,080
Namor, Namor, Namor.

11325
08:44:47,940 --> 08:44:49,440
I'm ulting after this.

11326
08:44:49,720 --> 08:44:50,480
I'm dead here.

11327
08:44:53,960 --> 08:44:55,000
I'm gonna...

11328
08:44:55,000 --> 08:44:56,460
I killed the man.

11329
08:44:58,160 --> 08:44:59,780
Wait, we win this, we win this.

11330
08:45:01,800 --> 08:45:05,220
Oh my god, Ruben, you fucking...

11331
08:45:05,840 --> 08:45:07,800
You fucking popped off.

11332
08:45:08,060 --> 08:45:09,460
Yeah, it's just that easy.

11333
08:45:10,040 --> 08:45:11,180
You pushed the button.

11334
08:45:11,480 --> 08:45:13,520
It's just that free, what can I say.

11335
08:45:14,960 --> 08:45:15,700
That's crazy.

11336
08:45:16,000 --> 08:45:17,340
I did that in my sleep.

11337
08:45:18,340 --> 08:45:20,220
You were so quiet, you were so locked in.

11338
08:45:21,260 --> 08:45:23,040
You literally stopped talking.

11339
08:45:23,040 --> 08:45:24,560
You were so locked in.

11340
08:45:24,880 --> 08:45:29,220
If I stop talking, that's how you know something's going on.

11341
08:45:30,240 --> 08:45:32,780
You literally stopped saying words.

11342
08:45:34,080 --> 08:45:34,800
That's crazy.

11343
08:45:38,100 --> 08:45:39,940
Oh my god.

11344
08:45:40,680 --> 08:45:41,680
Look at us go.

11345
08:45:41,880 --> 08:45:43,360
Back to GM2.

11346
08:45:43,560 --> 08:45:46,140
Let's go, we're back in it.

11347
08:45:46,700 --> 08:45:48,460
Oh wow, that was an instant kill.

11348
08:45:49,320 --> 08:45:51,360
I'm so happy we had a tank clear there.

11349
08:45:51,360 --> 08:45:52,740
Now it's all going to be downhill.

11350
08:45:56,910 --> 08:45:58,670
I like, some of them I don't even recognize.

11351
08:45:59,010 --> 08:46:01,130
I'm like, they must have just woke up.

11352
08:46:01,550 --> 08:46:03,530
Top 1 GunZ player.

11353
08:46:03,970 --> 08:46:05,410
That's not Carter, is it?

11354
08:46:08,870 --> 08:46:10,430
Guys, we don't have... no.

11355
08:46:10,670 --> 08:46:12,330
We have 3 support players again.

11356
08:46:14,370 --> 08:46:15,210
Oh no.

11357
08:46:18,390 --> 08:46:19,790
I'm banning Hawkeye.

11358
08:46:19,790 --> 08:46:20,950
Alright.

11359
08:46:22,450 --> 08:46:24,070
Always ban Hawkeye.

11360
08:46:27,690 --> 08:46:28,950
No, I can't.

11361
08:46:28,990 --> 08:46:31,790
I have to go through another...

11362
08:46:32,930 --> 08:46:33,950
3 support players.

11363
08:46:34,270 --> 08:46:36,350
Why did this guy ban Black Panther?

11364
08:46:37,430 --> 08:46:38,110
Oh, thank god.

11365
08:46:38,610 --> 08:46:38,970
Dude!

11366
08:46:38,970 --> 08:46:39,310
Dude!

11367
08:46:47,330 --> 08:46:48,930
Do we ban Hawkeye?

11368
08:46:49,190 --> 08:46:49,910
Do we do it?

11369
08:46:51,170 --> 08:46:52,150
Black Panther?

11370
08:46:52,410 --> 08:46:52,750
Why?

11371
08:46:53,230 --> 08:46:54,970
Do they actually...

11372
08:46:59,300 --> 08:47:02,600
I'm going to be the one guy to ban Hawkeye.

11373
08:47:03,200 --> 08:47:03,720
Bro!

11374
08:47:06,120 --> 08:47:06,640
Fuck!

11375
08:47:06,640 --> 08:47:06,860
Fuck!

11376
08:47:09,020 --> 08:47:10,720
I mean, they left Hela open.

11377
08:47:10,860 --> 08:47:13,220
So I guess I just have to terrorize them on this.

11378
08:47:13,460 --> 08:47:15,960
You gotta do something to make them remember.

11379
08:47:16,940 --> 08:47:18,120
But we don't have a tank.

11380
08:47:18,180 --> 08:47:18,540
Oh, wait.

11381
08:47:19,540 --> 08:47:24,080
I'm pretty good at this character too.

11382
08:47:28,220 --> 08:47:29,680
Wait, we didn't ban Mantis.

11383
08:47:32,860 --> 08:47:34,040
No, sir.

11384
08:47:36,320 --> 08:47:37,000
You're playing Punisher?

11385
08:47:37,080 --> 08:47:38,420
You're playing Punisher?

11386
08:47:38,600 --> 08:47:40,120
How are you not going to do more damage?

11387
08:47:40,240 --> 08:47:42,880
I think you should go to federal prison if you don't do more damage.

11388
08:47:43,540 --> 08:47:44,980
You have a turret and full auto.

11389
08:47:48,700 --> 08:47:49,580
Why are you on my dick?

11390
08:47:50,680 --> 08:47:52,020
Why are you on my dick?

11391
08:47:52,460 --> 08:47:52,760
No.

11392
08:47:53,460 --> 08:47:54,660
The answer is no.

11393
08:47:55,260 --> 08:47:56,500
I just flipped the strip.

11394
08:47:56,600 --> 08:47:57,740
I just used your logic.

11395
08:48:02,660 --> 08:48:04,580
Oh man, I'm sad we don't get Mantis Luna.

11396
08:48:05,360 --> 08:48:09,780
Let's hope this Loki can sustain without a Mantis.

11397
08:48:10,740 --> 08:48:13,500
Yo, okay, he's going to get five if he doesn't get more damage.

11398
08:48:16,540 --> 08:48:18,580
And if he does get more damage, he gets nothing.

11399
08:48:19,360 --> 08:48:20,880
I'm a master of the deal.

11400
08:48:22,600 --> 08:48:23,740
I'll give it to...

11401
08:48:23,740 --> 08:48:24,400
You read the book.

11402
08:48:24,680 --> 08:48:25,980
I don't have...

11403
08:48:25,980 --> 08:48:27,180
I'll give it to her tank.

11404
08:48:27,980 --> 08:48:30,440
Okay, I'll freeze somebody.

11405
08:48:31,280 --> 08:48:34,380
And I will bubble you if they...

11406
08:48:34,380 --> 08:48:36,360
They blocked my freeze.

11407
08:48:37,380 --> 08:48:38,220
That's fucked up.

11408
08:48:38,520 --> 08:48:40,300
That's fucked up, that's fucked actually.

11409
08:48:45,160 --> 08:48:46,460
I dropped down a little.

11410
08:48:48,120 --> 08:48:50,020
I got a little scared, not going to lie.

11411
08:48:52,480 --> 08:48:53,200
Okay.

11412
08:48:53,200 --> 08:48:54,220
Our Loki's dead.

11413
08:48:54,660 --> 08:48:55,540
I don't know how.

11414
08:48:55,880 --> 08:48:57,740
Oh, because they're over here.

11415
08:49:00,320 --> 08:49:01,580
I got you.

11416
08:49:03,240 --> 08:49:05,000
Yo, nice.

11417
08:49:05,740 --> 08:49:05,960
Okay.

11418
08:49:08,780 --> 08:49:14,140
Oh my god, someone be wanting our fucking...

11419
08:49:15,000 --> 08:49:17,480
I hear some footsteps near me.

11420
08:49:18,200 --> 08:49:19,720
There's like a Luna or someone up there.

11421
08:49:20,020 --> 08:49:20,840
Yeah, there's...

11422
08:49:20,840 --> 08:49:24,420
There's a Luna and a other guy in our spawn.

11423
08:49:26,020 --> 08:49:26,980
There's a Luna, right?

11424
08:49:27,540 --> 08:49:29,580
Yeah, I was like, why are these footsteps?

11425
08:49:30,260 --> 08:49:32,880
Dude, it's so satisfying to save people with bubbles, man.

11426
08:49:32,960 --> 08:49:33,760
It's so much fun.

11427
08:49:34,760 --> 08:49:36,080
I'm going to put it on our tank.

11428
08:49:36,140 --> 08:49:37,700
Our tank really fucking needs these heals.

11429
08:49:41,460 --> 08:49:44,460
After what I just saw, that shit was crazy.

11430
08:49:45,560 --> 08:49:46,760
Oh, shit!

11431
08:49:46,860 --> 08:49:48,040
Oh my god!

11432
08:49:48,160 --> 08:49:49,420
Top one guts player!

11433
08:49:50,100 --> 08:49:50,940
Fucking doing it.

11434
08:49:51,040 --> 08:49:52,260
That timing is insane.

11435
08:49:53,680 --> 08:49:54,380
I'm out here.

11436
08:49:55,260 --> 08:49:56,520
I just got camera diff'd.

11437
08:49:57,820 --> 08:49:58,720
What happened?

11438
08:49:59,820 --> 08:50:02,060
I was walking on a corner where my camera was covered.

11439
08:50:04,800 --> 08:50:08,940
Oh, I'm fucking...

11440
08:50:08,940 --> 08:50:10,620
Magic, hit her twice.

11441
08:50:12,040 --> 08:50:13,660
I'm going to... I'm ulting on point.

11442
08:50:14,400 --> 08:50:15,400
I'm ulting on point.

11443
08:50:15,600 --> 08:50:17,040
We're letting them free cap.

11444
08:50:18,280 --> 08:50:19,460
Oh, I'm getting in your ult.

11445
08:50:20,000 --> 08:50:21,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11446
08:50:21,780 --> 08:50:25,420
They're going to have a lot of ult still for them after this.

11447
08:50:29,360 --> 08:50:30,260
Strange, strange, strange!

11448
08:50:32,180 --> 08:50:33,120
I'm trying to keep you up.

11449
08:50:33,240 --> 08:50:35,220
I'm trying to keep you up.

11450
08:50:35,320 --> 08:50:36,500
I'm trying so hard.

11451
08:50:38,340 --> 08:50:39,560
Oh, that's not you.

11452
08:50:39,560 --> 08:50:40,740
I forgot you're a non-punisher.

11453
08:50:43,320 --> 08:50:45,180
Oh my god, magic solo!

11454
08:50:48,680 --> 08:50:49,680
Oh, nice!

11455
08:50:53,060 --> 08:50:54,060
Magneil, Magneil!

11456
08:50:54,440 --> 08:50:55,580
I froze him, I froze him!

11457
08:50:56,240 --> 08:50:57,680
God, I froze him because of me!

11458
08:51:00,420 --> 08:51:02,440
Top one gunsie player, nice!

11459
08:51:03,100 --> 08:51:04,600
The guy's just lurking on Hela.

11460
08:51:04,780 --> 08:51:06,600
He's actually so strange.

11461
08:51:07,280 --> 08:51:10,140
If he's going to lurk, I can give you...

11462
08:51:10,140 --> 08:51:11,780
Oh my god, I can give you Orb.

11463
08:51:12,200 --> 08:51:13,720
Where are you?

11464
08:51:15,020 --> 08:51:18,300
I'll give you Orb first before I give it to Ting.

11465
08:51:26,060 --> 08:51:27,880
I might be able to build ults here.

11466
08:51:31,580 --> 08:51:33,880
I missed the...

11467
08:51:36,880 --> 08:51:38,020
I forgot I'm alive!

11468
08:51:38,420 --> 08:51:38,720
What?

11469
08:51:38,720 --> 08:51:40,000
Ah, shit.

11470
08:51:40,700 --> 08:51:42,560
No, I didn't see the heal up!

11471
08:51:44,480 --> 08:51:46,460
I almost have ult too.

11472
08:51:49,480 --> 08:51:51,440
I have to reload, man.

11473
08:51:51,660 --> 08:51:51,880
Fuck me.

11474
08:51:51,880 --> 08:51:55,480
I'm coming back, but I don't know if we're going to be able to cut guard it.

11475
08:51:59,040 --> 08:52:00,120
I can...

11476
08:52:00,120 --> 08:52:01,480
I can maybe stall?

11477
08:52:05,680 --> 08:52:07,260
Oh, our Punisher has ult.

11478
08:52:07,260 --> 08:52:08,780
Yeah, I'm ulting.

11479
08:52:11,320 --> 08:52:12,620
Stand into this ult!

11480
08:52:12,720 --> 08:52:13,000
Punisher!

11481
08:52:13,400 --> 08:52:14,620
I'm so safe!

11482
08:52:19,440 --> 08:52:20,680
They're going to have...

11483
08:52:20,990 --> 08:52:21,700
They're going to have...

11484
08:52:23,010 --> 08:52:23,300
No!

11485
08:52:24,580 --> 08:52:25,160
What?

11486
08:52:25,480 --> 08:52:26,500
How did we get off?

11487
08:52:26,700 --> 08:52:28,420
That is the most depressing thing ever.

11488
08:52:28,780 --> 08:52:33,360
I can't believe we got off with all Ting and DPS and support.

11489
08:52:34,220 --> 08:52:35,300
And I was one of them.

11490
08:52:35,820 --> 08:52:37,280
I was coming back.

11491
08:52:37,340 --> 08:52:38,180
I'm so sad.

11492
08:52:38,400 --> 08:52:38,960
That's okay.

11493
08:52:39,040 --> 08:52:40,540
Two minutes, that's super doable.

11494
08:52:41,600 --> 08:52:42,440
Oh, man.

11495
08:52:43,600 --> 08:52:44,420
I'm so sad.

11496
08:52:44,520 --> 08:52:47,100
I got off because I was like, I'm going to heal on the side.

11497
08:52:48,360 --> 08:52:49,360
That is so sad.

11498
08:52:54,880 --> 08:52:56,140
He's like nonchalant.

11499
08:52:56,200 --> 08:52:58,820
The fact that we lost the point and just went...

11500
08:52:58,820 --> 08:52:59,500
Weepy!

11501
08:53:04,100 --> 08:53:06,060
Yeah, bye.

11502
08:53:08,260 --> 08:53:08,700
Bro.

11503
08:53:11,400 --> 08:53:12,280
I can't.

11504
08:53:12,280 --> 08:53:13,380
I can't with my Punisher.

11505
08:53:14,260 --> 08:53:15,800
I can't heal you, by the way, up there.

11506
08:53:16,400 --> 08:53:16,840
Oh!

11507
08:53:17,480 --> 08:53:17,940
Venom on me!

11508
08:53:18,040 --> 08:53:18,380
Look up!

11509
08:53:19,600 --> 08:53:20,480
I can't.

11510
08:53:20,500 --> 08:53:21,380
I couldn't heal you up there.

11511
08:53:23,180 --> 08:53:23,940
Venom's a problem.

11512
08:53:24,040 --> 08:53:25,200
I have to just stand on the edge.

11513
08:53:29,140 --> 08:53:29,700
Arm.

11514
08:53:30,500 --> 08:53:31,060
Arm.

11515
08:53:32,100 --> 08:53:32,540
Arm.

11516
08:53:36,420 --> 08:53:38,980
We have to regroup and have one push together.

11517
08:53:39,360 --> 08:53:40,220
Or not, actually.

11518
08:53:41,880 --> 08:53:43,000
So when...

11519
08:53:43,000 --> 08:53:44,080
I can ult and touch.

11520
08:53:44,100 --> 08:53:45,440
I just got headshot over.

11521
08:53:46,000 --> 08:53:46,560
Are we touching?

11522
08:53:48,140 --> 08:53:50,040
Okay, I'm going in.

11523
08:53:56,670 --> 08:53:58,310
We have hell ult, though.

11524
08:53:58,310 --> 08:53:59,570
They took it all.

11525
08:54:03,180 --> 08:54:04,160
Venom on HP, beyond.

11526
08:54:05,220 --> 08:54:06,560
There's nothing I can do.

11527
08:54:08,520 --> 08:54:09,800
We have almost...

11528
08:54:09,800 --> 08:54:10,320
That's huge!

11529
08:54:14,480 --> 08:54:16,360
We're coming back.

11530
08:54:18,820 --> 08:54:19,760
Oh, no.

11531
08:54:20,320 --> 08:54:21,620
No, no, no.

11532
08:54:22,460 --> 08:54:23,460
I killed their Manta.

11533
08:54:23,540 --> 08:54:24,940
I am Captain America!

11534
08:54:25,700 --> 08:54:26,660
You're Captain, you're him!

11535
08:54:30,800 --> 08:54:31,280
Wow.

11536
08:54:35,300 --> 08:54:36,520
Not the Wailord.

11537
08:54:38,020 --> 08:54:38,820
There's support.

11538
08:54:39,000 --> 08:54:40,140
There's a Luna at the backline.

11539
08:54:48,720 --> 08:54:50,540
Kill the Carnage Johnson!

11540
08:54:52,800 --> 08:54:53,540
I killed Luna.

11541
08:54:55,380 --> 08:54:56,600
You did not kill Venom.

11542
08:54:56,680 --> 08:54:57,780
I see him walking around.

11543
08:54:59,380 --> 08:55:00,040
Oh, sorry.

11544
08:55:00,100 --> 08:55:00,240
Luna.

11545
08:55:01,780 --> 08:55:02,580
I think it's just magic.

11546
08:55:02,580 --> 08:55:04,480
Magic, magic, magic, magic!

11547
08:55:04,660 --> 08:55:05,280
Magic's one!

11548
08:55:05,620 --> 08:55:07,100
God, I love Captain America!

11549
08:55:07,580 --> 08:55:09,760
You ran into him and went America!

11550
08:55:11,820 --> 08:55:14,040
Oh, dude, I got 90 to all two!

11551
08:55:15,720 --> 08:55:18,700
Can you own up like a man to our agreement?

11552
08:55:20,380 --> 08:55:21,340
What's your damage?

11553
08:55:23,260 --> 08:55:23,860
13k.

11554
08:55:24,120 --> 08:55:25,240
14 kills.

11555
08:55:26,200 --> 08:55:27,260
Less deaths.

11556
08:55:27,900 --> 08:55:28,520
Now why?

11557
08:55:30,220 --> 08:55:31,680
You're not a man.

11558
08:55:32,360 --> 08:55:34,720
You're not a man.

11559
08:55:34,820 --> 08:55:35,080
You're not a man.

11560
08:55:35,080 --> 08:55:36,060
You're a little boy.

11561
08:55:38,620 --> 08:55:40,580
I'm her friend.

11562
08:55:44,330 --> 08:55:46,620
I bet you cheat on your girlfriend.

11563
08:55:51,600 --> 08:55:53,520
I know, right?

11564
08:55:55,120 --> 08:55:55,760
Wow!

11565
08:55:58,520 --> 08:55:58,800
Wow!

11566
08:56:00,480 --> 08:56:01,980
Who hit you?

11567
08:56:05,040 --> 08:56:06,960
What a sweetie pie!

11568
08:56:08,220 --> 08:56:09,700
He agreed to our agreement.

11569
08:56:09,940 --> 08:56:11,020
I'm better than him at everything.

11570
08:56:11,040 --> 08:56:13,620
Wait, I didn't even agree!

11571
08:56:13,860 --> 08:56:15,740
I told you to get off my dick!

11572
08:56:16,140 --> 08:56:17,020
I didn't even agree!

11573
08:56:18,820 --> 08:56:20,640
Where's the five gift cards?

11574
08:56:21,840 --> 08:56:22,780
I don't know.

11575
08:56:22,880 --> 08:56:26,580
You give me five gifted and you get nothing.

11576
08:56:28,520 --> 08:56:29,900
You're in the right place.

11577
08:56:30,040 --> 08:56:31,080
It's over now.

11578
08:56:32,180 --> 08:56:34,520
Oh my god!

11579
08:56:34,580 --> 08:56:35,960
Oh my god!

11580
08:56:36,200 --> 08:56:36,940
This poor man!

11581
08:56:40,800 --> 08:56:41,460
Portal!

11582
08:56:45,640 --> 08:56:45,800
Portal!

11583
08:56:48,210 --> 08:56:48,800
Let's go back.

11584
08:56:49,220 --> 08:56:51,400
I love VCs.

11585
08:56:52,520 --> 08:56:53,000
That's ours!

11586
08:56:53,000 --> 08:56:54,080
That was ours!

11587
08:56:54,940 --> 08:56:56,600
I was like, I don't know where he is.

11588
08:56:58,880 --> 08:57:00,140
Oh my god!

11589
08:57:01,100 --> 08:57:01,660
Yeah, I know.

11590
08:57:04,060 --> 08:57:05,160
That scared me.

11591
08:57:05,240 --> 08:57:06,440
I legit thought that wasn't ours.

11592
08:57:06,760 --> 08:57:08,400
I went through so much trauma.

11593
08:57:09,940 --> 08:57:10,460
Get the Groot!

11594
08:57:10,720 --> 08:57:11,560
Literally Groot!

11595
08:57:12,540 --> 08:57:13,440
What the hell?

11596
08:57:13,880 --> 08:57:14,800
Is he playing Fortnite?

11597
08:57:14,800 --> 08:57:15,840
What the fuck?

11598
08:57:16,160 --> 08:57:22,280
Oh no no no!

11599
08:57:22,440 --> 08:57:22,780
Damn!

11600
08:57:24,580 --> 08:57:26,440
Top one gun player is fucking you down.

11601
08:57:27,420 --> 08:57:30,220
I just got Mantis headshot into a Hella headshot.

11602
08:57:30,400 --> 08:57:31,280
Like, what the fuck?

11603
08:57:32,520 --> 08:57:34,360
I'm gonna take my anchor off on my Teemo.

11604
08:57:36,120 --> 08:57:37,440
Yeah, fuck her up!

11605
08:57:41,700 --> 08:57:43,760
I'm like, so awake now after that.

11606
08:57:45,020 --> 08:57:48,280
I'm gonna start shooting tanks with stat pads so I can damage them.

11607
08:57:51,260 --> 08:57:52,880
You're really gonna let him win?

11608
08:57:53,040 --> 08:57:55,020
You're really gonna...

11609
08:57:55,020 --> 08:57:56,700
Nah, I'm killing tanks.

11610
08:57:56,800 --> 08:57:57,400
I'm stat padding.

11611
08:58:03,580 --> 08:58:06,360
Damn, you're like risking your life for this now.

11612
08:58:06,580 --> 08:58:07,680
You're motivated.

11613
08:58:08,200 --> 08:58:10,300
There's some passion right there.

11614
08:58:12,640 --> 08:58:13,080
Damn!

11615
08:58:13,780 --> 08:58:14,720
Oh, he's catching up.

11616
08:58:14,760 --> 08:58:15,740
He's gonna catch up now.

11617
08:58:16,120 --> 08:58:18,000
He's gonna catch up now.

11618
08:58:23,240 --> 08:58:24,160
Oh, this is huge.

11619
08:58:25,160 --> 08:58:27,480
Yo, check out this boulder, okay?

11620
08:58:28,980 --> 08:58:30,800
Just give me a second, I'm waiting for the Luna ult to end.

11621
08:58:33,880 --> 08:58:35,140
And the Mantis ult too.

11622
08:58:38,500 --> 08:58:40,980
Oh, we have a double Luna.

11623
08:58:41,620 --> 08:58:42,440
Mantis ult should have ended.

11624
08:58:51,180 --> 08:58:52,800
I got her.

11625
08:58:53,260 --> 08:58:55,160
Oh, she's coming over.

11626
08:58:56,060 --> 08:58:56,240
No!

11627
08:58:59,690 --> 08:59:01,460
Oh my god, I'm so scared.

11628
08:59:03,060 --> 08:59:05,600
Please, I got magicked.

11629
08:59:07,280 --> 08:59:09,780
There's magic Penny and Luna and Mantis.

11630
08:59:09,860 --> 08:59:10,900
I don't think we're winning this.

11631
08:59:13,340 --> 08:59:14,620
Oh, you're stat padding.

11632
08:59:14,900 --> 08:59:15,800
Maybe you'll win this.

11633
08:59:16,080 --> 08:59:16,260
I'm stat padding.

11634
08:59:18,300 --> 08:59:19,600
We have four minutes.

11635
08:59:20,640 --> 08:59:21,660
I'm coming back.

11636
08:59:22,760 --> 08:59:24,020
You gotta back up, back up, back up.

11637
08:59:26,780 --> 08:59:28,640
Back up if you can, back up if you can.

11638
08:59:28,740 --> 08:59:29,440
Oh, that's good, that's good.

11639
08:59:29,860 --> 08:59:30,440
That's good, that's good.

11640
08:59:30,920 --> 08:59:33,760
Oh, I knocked him back as he went for it.

11641
08:59:33,760 --> 08:59:35,120
I'm a mechanical genius.

11642
08:59:35,320 --> 08:59:37,820
By the way, I cannot heal you from up there.

11643
08:59:38,140 --> 08:59:38,560
I'm faking.

11644
08:59:39,000 --> 08:59:40,080
I give you an orb.

11645
08:59:41,620 --> 08:59:42,740
Jesus Christ.

11646
08:59:42,940 --> 08:59:43,580
Look at that Penny.

11647
08:59:44,120 --> 08:59:45,780
I made him overextend.

11648
08:59:46,840 --> 08:59:49,760
I have ult soon.

11649
08:59:51,320 --> 08:59:51,880
Nice.

11650
08:59:52,380 --> 08:59:53,720
I'm reloading.

11651
08:59:55,340 --> 08:59:56,800
We haven't won!

11652
08:59:58,600 --> 09:00:00,000
But you did a nice job!

11653
09:00:03,760 --> 09:00:04,440
Oh my god.

11654
09:00:06,380 --> 09:00:08,180
Their entire team is back now.

11655
09:00:09,620 --> 09:00:11,000
Nah, check out this boulder.

11656
09:00:11,880 --> 09:00:12,900
Yeah, I'm checking it out.

11657
09:00:14,580 --> 09:00:15,300
Hold up.

11658
09:00:16,380 --> 09:00:17,340
It's gonna be a boulder moment.

11659
09:00:18,380 --> 09:00:19,520
I'm getting dived.

11660
09:00:23,420 --> 09:00:27,240
Yeah, but you only have low-key heals.

11661
09:00:28,000 --> 09:00:28,640
Nah, it's chill.

11662
09:00:30,860 --> 09:00:32,020
Oh, it's not chill.

11663
09:00:32,020 --> 09:00:33,200
They're so low.

11664
09:00:33,380 --> 09:00:34,480
We gotta regroup.

11665
09:00:34,800 --> 09:00:36,960
We gotta regroup.

11666
09:00:43,540 --> 09:00:44,880
Oh my god!

11667
09:00:45,080 --> 09:00:46,340
There's so much damage.

11668
09:00:49,540 --> 09:00:50,780
Oh, I missed it.

11669
09:00:52,880 --> 09:00:53,960
Okay, I'm not peeking.

11670
09:00:54,060 --> 09:00:54,920
I'm not cocky anymore.

11671
09:00:55,500 --> 09:00:56,940
Yeah, but what if you did it one more time?

11672
09:00:59,320 --> 09:01:00,940
Yeah, we need to kill the healers.

11673
09:01:05,600 --> 09:01:06,540
We still have it!

11674
09:01:08,920 --> 09:01:10,360
What just killed me?

11675
09:01:10,580 --> 09:01:14,540
That was a Mantis one-tap!

11676
09:01:15,680 --> 09:01:17,420
We have two fights left.

11677
09:01:18,600 --> 09:01:22,580
I can get all, but they have all two.

11678
09:01:25,320 --> 09:01:27,220
They pushed it really far.

11679
09:01:27,360 --> 09:01:28,160
Oh my god.

11680
09:01:37,600 --> 09:01:38,120
Yeah.

11681
09:01:38,660 --> 09:01:39,180
Okay.

11682
09:01:40,780 --> 09:01:42,740
They pushed pretty far, so...

11683
09:01:42,740 --> 09:01:45,000
No, there's a Helmeteer left!

11684
09:01:45,100 --> 09:01:45,920
There's a Helmeteer left!

11685
09:01:46,600 --> 09:01:48,080
I have to ult.

11686
09:01:51,640 --> 09:01:53,140
Yo, Punisher, look right!

11687
09:01:53,220 --> 09:01:53,940
Shoot her ult, bro!

11688
09:01:55,200 --> 09:01:56,940
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

11689
09:02:03,000 --> 09:02:04,960
Just fight on point if we can.

11690
09:02:05,120 --> 09:02:05,780
I'm coming over.

11691
09:02:05,780 --> 09:02:07,640
Punisher, I'm coming over with ult.

11692
09:02:09,320 --> 09:02:10,660
You just two-tapped me!

11693
09:02:11,740 --> 09:02:12,860
I got two-tapped!

11694
09:02:15,620 --> 09:02:16,340
Dude, what?

11695
09:02:17,560 --> 09:02:20,360
We have to back up, we have to reset, we have to reset, we have to reset.

11696
09:02:20,960 --> 09:02:22,200
I'm not ulting, I'm not ulting this.

11697
09:02:22,540 --> 09:02:23,080
Let me just reset.

11698
09:02:23,260 --> 09:02:24,580
This is good that we died to that.

11699
09:02:24,740 --> 09:02:25,780
Yeah, I'm resetting.

11700
09:02:27,500 --> 09:02:27,860
No,

11701
09:02:34,770 --> 09:02:35,310
no, no!

11702
09:02:35,850 --> 09:02:37,330
Let's see if we can two-tap them.

11703
09:02:37,450 --> 09:02:38,310
We got time, we got time.

11704
09:02:39,270 --> 09:02:41,410
We wait for our Luna, and we win this.

11705
09:02:42,330 --> 09:02:43,230
I don't know if you guys...

11706
09:02:43,230 --> 09:02:45,570
I don't know if you guys can wait for me.

11707
09:02:45,610 --> 09:02:45,750
Okay.

11708
09:02:47,590 --> 09:02:48,310
I'm about to die.

11709
09:02:49,410 --> 09:02:49,770
Hello?

11710
09:02:53,050 --> 09:02:55,910
I have to go in with ult then.

11711
09:02:59,210 --> 09:02:59,930
Gotta go.

11712
09:03:00,950 --> 09:03:02,510
I'm on it.

11713
09:03:05,310 --> 09:03:06,790
I'm ready to put on a show!

11714
09:03:08,250 --> 09:03:09,890
My ult ends in three seconds.

11715
09:03:11,070 --> 09:03:13,130
We can definitely stall this for long now.

11716
09:03:14,830 --> 09:03:16,470
I might die from this.

11717
09:03:16,690 --> 09:03:16,930
Yeah.

11718
09:03:19,390 --> 09:03:21,170
You only have low-key heals.

11719
09:03:22,890 --> 09:03:24,930
Where are my shots coming from?

11720
09:03:25,130 --> 09:03:25,630
Damn.

11721
09:03:26,430 --> 09:03:29,810
Oh my god, we had so many picks too.

11722
09:03:30,670 --> 09:03:32,390
That thing's just about to die.

11723
09:03:34,410 --> 09:03:35,610
That's unfortunate.

11724
09:03:38,950 --> 09:03:43,990
Bro, this guy is still talking about it!

11725
09:03:44,070 --> 09:03:46,310
Hey man, I'd expect that from Punisher.

11726
09:03:48,830 --> 09:03:51,270
Bro, he lost it!

11727
09:03:51,450 --> 09:03:53,510
He's like, I'm just damage though.

11728
09:03:56,850 --> 09:03:57,450
Okay.

11729
09:04:00,700 --> 09:04:02,360
I'm minus 12 in GM too.

11730
09:04:02,360 --> 09:04:03,740
We gotta win this next one.

11731
09:04:04,320 --> 09:04:05,600
I'm not demoting.

11732
09:04:06,800 --> 09:04:10,000
The worst part was I wasn't even getting slammed by their Hello.

11733
09:04:10,100 --> 09:04:11,260
It was their Mantis.

11734
09:04:11,940 --> 09:04:15,500
Their Mantis would randomly headshot me across the fucking map.

11735
09:04:15,820 --> 09:04:18,080
Oh my god, that guy had a lot of damage.

11736
09:04:18,260 --> 09:04:18,980
Holy shit!

11737
09:04:19,800 --> 09:04:20,300
Yeah!

11738
09:04:24,080 --> 09:04:25,740
That guy was...

11739
09:04:25,740 --> 09:04:26,180
Wow.

11740
09:04:26,180 --> 09:04:26,280
Wow.

11741
09:04:29,160 --> 09:04:31,820
I think if we had a Mantis though, it would have been easier.

11742
09:04:32,540 --> 09:04:33,940
With the damage boost.

11743
09:04:34,940 --> 09:04:37,060
But I think this guy is a low-key one-trick.

11744
09:04:38,780 --> 09:04:39,840
There's no way.

11745
09:04:40,960 --> 09:04:42,140
Oh my god.

11746
09:04:45,570 --> 09:04:47,570
There's no way to win that.

11747
09:04:48,790 --> 09:04:50,810
Man, that game was going so well too.

11748
09:04:50,990 --> 09:04:53,530
It would have been less painful if we weren't so close to winning.

11749
09:04:53,850 --> 09:04:54,330
I know!

11750
09:04:54,330 --> 09:04:56,590
We actually got so many picks but we couldn't kill them.

11751
09:04:56,670 --> 09:04:58,470
They had double support ult.

11752
09:04:59,070 --> 09:04:59,990
But we didn't.

11753
09:05:03,540 --> 09:05:06,040
It would be fine when low-key a Mantis was banned.

11754
09:05:07,320 --> 09:05:08,880
How do you even one-trick in these ranks?

11755
09:05:09,020 --> 09:05:09,400
You can't.

11756
09:05:10,760 --> 09:05:11,820
Don't worry.

11757
09:05:12,180 --> 09:05:13,040
People can.

11758
09:05:13,780 --> 09:05:16,560
Because you one-trick a character that never gets banned.

11759
09:05:17,260 --> 09:05:17,800
That's how.

11760
09:05:20,520 --> 09:05:22,360
Because who the fuck would ban low-key?

11761
09:05:22,460 --> 09:05:23,580
It's such a dogshit hero.

11762
09:05:29,280 --> 09:05:30,500
Okay, it's not dogshit.

11763
09:05:30,620 --> 09:05:32,620
But when you have other options.

11764
09:05:33,020 --> 09:05:35,360
When you actually have other options.

11765
09:05:39,100 --> 09:05:44,180
When you have Luna, Mantis, Cloak, and Adam.

11766
09:05:45,460 --> 09:05:47,360
Why would you pick low-key?

11767
09:05:52,840 --> 09:05:59,860
Why would you pick any of those characters when you literally have the other stuff?

11768
09:06:02,500 --> 09:06:03,220
Hawkeye?

11769
09:06:05,320 --> 09:06:06,040
Yes.

11770
09:06:06,560 --> 09:06:08,920
I guess I'm the only person voting.

11771
09:06:09,160 --> 09:06:09,720
Let's go.

11772
09:06:09,920 --> 09:06:10,560
Let's go.

11773
09:06:11,280 --> 09:06:12,400
Grab Hulk next.

11774
09:06:12,580 --> 09:06:14,140
This is a really good Ironman map.

11775
09:06:15,120 --> 09:06:19,180
Adam is meta depending on what is banned.

11776
09:06:20,020 --> 09:06:22,820
If Luna's banned, you play Adam and Mantis.

11777
09:06:24,600 --> 09:06:26,460
In high elo.

11778
09:06:27,980 --> 09:06:29,320
I'm going to shit my pants.

11779
09:06:29,500 --> 09:06:30,700
It's going to happen.

11780
09:06:37,820 --> 09:06:38,900
No way.

11781
09:06:40,360 --> 09:06:41,800
The 20%.

11782
09:06:42,760 --> 09:06:46,020
Bro, he took your one trick.

11783
09:06:46,100 --> 09:06:47,240
That's so fucked up.

11784
09:06:48,920 --> 09:06:50,340
Let's see.

11785
09:06:51,020 --> 09:06:51,620
Damn.

11786
09:06:56,980 --> 09:06:58,080
Oh, he wants to play Adam?

11787
09:06:58,240 --> 09:06:58,560
Okay.

11788
09:06:59,080 --> 09:07:01,060
I was going to decide which one.

11789
09:07:01,960 --> 09:07:04,600
Please give him a Star Lord.

11790
09:07:18,280 --> 09:07:20,860
Yeah, but what if he wants it on his Christmas day?

11791
09:07:21,380 --> 09:07:23,020
Fuck his Christmas day.

11792
09:07:23,260 --> 09:07:24,260
Spider-Man it is.

11793
09:07:24,860 --> 09:07:25,840
Mack, please.

11794
09:07:27,820 --> 09:07:29,080
Mack, I will...

11795
09:07:31,920 --> 09:07:34,000
I just had to threaten terrorism.

11796
09:07:35,520 --> 09:07:38,080
I will find out where you live.

11797
09:07:41,240 --> 09:07:43,720
You are not holding me hostage in this lobby.

11798
09:07:44,600 --> 09:07:48,540
As the person in my sack, I refuse to let somebody hold me hostage.

11799
09:07:50,400 --> 09:07:51,560
I'm on Mantis.

11800
09:07:51,720 --> 09:07:53,180
I'll be randomly muted.

11801
09:07:57,120 --> 09:07:58,580
He went Spider-Man.

11802
09:07:58,580 --> 09:08:00,460
You made him go Spider-Man.

11803
09:08:00,700 --> 09:08:01,640
Oh, that's okay.

11804
09:08:02,040 --> 09:08:02,640
O.W.

11805
09:08:02,800 --> 09:08:04,160
Neal is the goat on Spider-Man.

11806
09:08:05,760 --> 09:08:06,340
Oh,

11807
09:08:11,620 --> 09:08:11,620
wait.

11808
09:08:12,660 --> 09:08:14,580
They also have...

11809
09:08:18,620 --> 09:08:19,340
Grits won!

11810
09:08:19,420 --> 09:08:19,720
Grits won!

11811
09:08:19,820 --> 09:08:20,680
Grits actually won!

11812
09:08:21,120 --> 09:08:21,980
Oh my god.

11813
09:08:22,140 --> 09:08:22,960
I'm so sad.

11814
09:08:24,260 --> 09:08:25,020
Mantis is dead.

11815
09:08:29,380 --> 09:08:31,140
Oh my god, I'm so low.

11816
09:08:34,990 --> 09:08:36,290
He's doing the wall shit.

11817
09:08:36,530 --> 09:08:37,770
You are not rezzing.

11818
09:08:42,520 --> 09:08:43,620
No, they're one!

11819
09:08:45,180 --> 09:08:46,160
Oh my god.

11820
09:08:47,020 --> 09:08:47,360
Got him.

11821
09:08:49,180 --> 09:08:50,180
Wait, I'm...

11822
09:08:50,180 --> 09:08:51,360
Oh my god, there's a Nomura.

11823
09:08:51,460 --> 09:08:52,360
There's Nomura over here.

11824
09:08:54,520 --> 09:08:55,400
Oh my god.

11825
09:08:55,660 --> 09:08:57,880
Nomura just two-tapped me from so far.

11826
09:09:02,650 --> 09:09:03,090
Fuck.

11827
09:09:04,710 --> 09:09:04,910
Alright.

11828
09:09:05,190 --> 09:09:06,530
I'm gonna get five picks here.

11829
09:09:09,110 --> 09:09:09,550
Alright.

11830
09:09:09,770 --> 09:09:12,790
We got so many picks too, but we didn't play on point.

11831
09:09:16,580 --> 09:09:18,000
So, Starlord's looking for you.

11832
09:09:20,600 --> 09:09:21,260
I... yeah.

11833
09:09:23,220 --> 09:09:24,020
Oh, he missed!

11834
09:09:24,100 --> 09:09:24,280
He missed!

11835
09:09:24,300 --> 09:09:24,580
He missed!

11836
09:09:24,860 --> 09:09:25,240
I'm damaged.

11837
09:09:25,380 --> 09:09:31,520
I slept through it.

11838
09:09:31,980 --> 09:09:32,540
Grew one!

11839
09:09:32,660 --> 09:09:32,900
Grew one!

11840
09:09:33,000 --> 09:09:33,300
Grew one!

11841
09:09:36,180 --> 09:09:37,060
Damage boosting you?

11842
09:09:40,240 --> 09:09:40,640
Ah!

11843
09:09:41,240 --> 09:09:42,100
Oh, he's dead.

11844
09:09:42,680 --> 09:09:43,680
He got...

11845
09:09:43,680 --> 09:09:44,540
I killed Starlord.

11846
09:09:45,580 --> 09:09:46,520
Wait, he's so low!

11847
09:09:46,680 --> 09:09:47,000
Thor's low!

11848
09:09:47,080 --> 09:09:47,460
Thor's low!

11849
09:09:49,420 --> 09:09:49,980
Thor one!

11850
09:09:50,080 --> 09:09:50,420
Thor one!

11851
09:09:50,500 --> 09:09:50,820
Thor one!

11852
09:09:50,880 --> 09:09:51,220
I got Thor.

11853
09:09:55,240 --> 09:09:57,420
Oh my god, I hear a Nomura right now.

11854
09:09:57,420 --> 09:09:57,920
I'm scared.

11855
09:09:57,920 --> 09:09:59,960
Oh my god.

11856
09:10:00,040 --> 09:10:00,960
Oh my god.

11857
09:10:05,690 --> 09:10:07,290
Alright, I'm heading over to you.

11858
09:10:07,610 --> 09:10:09,010
I got damage boost on you.

11859
09:10:10,370 --> 09:10:12,170
And I'm damage boosting your Spider-Man.

11860
09:10:12,390 --> 09:10:13,550
Eventually, that'll hit something.

11861
09:10:14,690 --> 09:10:16,370
And then I slept the Thor.

11862
09:10:17,230 --> 09:10:18,230
And the Thor...

11863
09:10:18,230 --> 09:10:19,930
Thor should be a little bit dead.

11864
09:10:20,090 --> 09:10:20,230
Nope.

11865
09:10:21,350 --> 09:10:24,250
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's possible to heal me.

11866
09:10:24,510 --> 09:10:24,910
Yeah, no.

11867
09:10:25,010 --> 09:10:25,470
That's on me.

11868
09:10:26,010 --> 09:10:26,570
I got you.

11869
09:10:30,350 --> 09:10:30,710
Oh my god.

11870
09:10:32,310 --> 09:10:32,910
Nice.

11871
09:10:35,630 --> 09:10:37,250
Oh my god, please.

11872
09:10:40,770 --> 09:10:42,590
Oh my god, what?!

11873
09:10:42,590 --> 09:10:44,950
Does he fucking breathe to me?!

11874
09:10:44,950 --> 09:10:45,110
No!

11875
09:10:46,630 --> 09:10:47,450
I'm dying.

11876
09:10:48,830 --> 09:10:49,850
Okay, good job.

11877
09:10:51,110 --> 09:10:52,370
No, I'm fucking bleeding.

11878
09:10:54,410 --> 09:10:58,390
Okay, that's fine.

11879
09:10:58,410 --> 09:10:59,290
I have ult on me.

11880
09:11:02,030 --> 09:11:05,670
There's a Groot literally on my ass right now.

11881
09:11:10,070 --> 09:11:11,790
Oh my god, Spider-Man.

11882
09:11:12,030 --> 09:11:13,030
I hope you live.

11883
09:11:14,610 --> 09:11:15,110
Oh,

11884
09:11:18,470 --> 09:11:19,210
Ace, please.

11885
09:11:21,970 --> 09:11:22,570
Here, Reuben.

11886
09:11:22,750 --> 09:11:23,830
I'm giving you damage boost.

11887
09:11:24,170 --> 09:11:25,090
Do something with it.

11888
09:11:26,170 --> 09:11:27,090
So is one.

11889
09:11:28,950 --> 09:11:30,190
Oh, he missed again!

11890
09:11:30,810 --> 09:11:32,390
He's so bad at Groot.

11891
09:11:32,550 --> 09:11:33,950
Please, we can't let this happen.

11892
09:11:35,190 --> 09:11:36,150
He's literally asleep.

11893
09:11:36,330 --> 09:11:36,930
He's asleep.

11894
09:11:37,070 --> 09:11:37,730
He's everything.

11895
09:11:39,810 --> 09:11:40,190
Here we go.

11896
09:11:41,830 --> 09:11:44,190
Oh my god, I'm like...

11897
09:11:44,870 --> 09:11:50,170
How is this Groot still alive?!

11898
09:11:52,910 --> 09:11:53,350
I'm...

11899
09:11:53,350 --> 09:11:54,150
Here, they have Born.

11900
09:11:54,190 --> 09:11:54,670
They have Born again.

11901
09:11:55,190 --> 09:11:56,430
Oh, beautiful.

11902
09:11:57,850 --> 09:11:58,250
Alright.

11903
09:11:59,430 --> 09:12:00,430
No more, no more, no more!

11904
09:12:00,550 --> 09:12:01,250
To your left, to your left!

11905
09:12:02,590 --> 09:12:02,990
Alright.

11906
09:12:06,450 --> 09:12:07,170
I'm using mine.

11907
09:12:13,140 --> 09:12:14,240
Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor, Thor!

11908
09:12:15,000 --> 09:12:16,440
Oh, he got healed.

11909
09:12:18,360 --> 09:12:18,760
Beautiful.

11910
09:12:19,880 --> 09:12:20,280
Fucking...

11911
09:12:20,280 --> 09:12:21,020
I fucked it.

11912
09:12:21,160 --> 09:12:21,800
I fucked it.

11913
09:12:24,140 --> 09:12:25,440
Oh, we got back out.

11914
09:12:25,640 --> 09:12:26,380
We got back out.

11915
09:12:26,380 --> 09:12:27,160
We don't win this.

11916
09:12:27,680 --> 09:12:28,760
We don't win this.

11917
09:12:28,960 --> 09:12:29,620
We got back out.

11918
09:12:29,720 --> 09:12:31,260
No, we don't, we don't, we don't.

11919
09:12:32,860 --> 09:12:33,200
Um...

11920
09:12:35,100 --> 09:12:35,780
Me and...

11921
09:12:36,460 --> 09:12:38,260
We're trying very hard.

11922
09:12:38,600 --> 09:12:41,340
They have no support ults, so I just went for the kill on their supports.

11923
09:12:43,000 --> 09:12:43,740
Oh my god!

11924
09:12:43,980 --> 09:12:45,880
I didn't realize they're... all of them are here.

11925
09:12:47,780 --> 09:12:48,460
They're right...

11926
09:12:52,510 --> 09:12:53,130
Where are you?

11927
09:12:53,470 --> 09:12:55,250
I don't have... I got you, I got you.

11928
09:12:56,890 --> 09:12:58,290
Nah, I don't wanna.

11929
09:12:59,810 --> 09:13:00,350
I don't even know...

11930
09:13:00,350 --> 09:13:00,830
Do we live this?

11931
09:13:00,930 --> 09:13:01,390
Yes, okay.

11932
09:13:01,630 --> 09:13:02,850
I'm probably dead.

11933
09:13:03,590 --> 09:13:04,250
Just gonna get out.

11934
09:13:08,050 --> 09:13:08,490
Okay.

11935
09:13:10,310 --> 09:13:11,970
Thor is so low, too.

11936
09:13:16,390 --> 09:13:16,830
Why?

11937
09:13:17,030 --> 09:13:18,490
I couldn't...

11938
09:13:18,490 --> 09:13:22,150
I don't have enough heals for this.

11939
09:13:23,970 --> 09:13:25,890
Only 60 seconds left.

11940
09:13:26,750 --> 09:13:28,270
Oh my fucking god.

11941
09:13:28,450 --> 09:13:29,150
Got it.

11942
09:13:31,690 --> 09:13:32,970
Oh my god, he's so low!

11943
09:13:33,110 --> 09:13:33,990
Adam is so low.

11944
09:13:35,490 --> 09:13:36,830
I don't have enough heals.

11945
09:13:37,390 --> 09:13:38,610
I got... nice, nice, nice, nice.

11946
09:13:39,430 --> 09:13:40,590
He might have Born again, though.

11947
09:13:41,930 --> 09:13:42,730
I'm gonna use this ult.

11948
09:13:43,930 --> 09:13:44,910
I'm pushing this.

11949
09:13:45,690 --> 09:13:46,910
We are undefeatable!

11950
09:13:46,910 --> 09:13:47,330
Use it.

11951
09:13:47,930 --> 09:13:48,370
Yeah.

11952
09:13:48,630 --> 09:13:50,730
Okay, I'm gonna wait for Mantis ult to end, and then I ult.

11953
09:13:52,010 --> 09:13:53,230
I just don't...

11954
09:13:53,230 --> 09:13:54,710
I got two guys, I think.

11955
09:13:55,590 --> 09:13:57,610
This is the last fight that we fight here.

11956
09:14:00,710 --> 09:14:02,110
Yeah, this is the last fight.

11957
09:14:03,010 --> 09:14:03,450
I'm...

11958
09:14:05,230 --> 09:14:06,910
Can we even touch it, though?

11959
09:14:09,150 --> 09:14:10,210
I'm... aw, shit.

11960
09:14:10,830 --> 09:14:12,330
Yeah, I don't think any of us can touch it.

11961
09:14:16,470 --> 09:14:17,990
I can't... I can't see you.

11962
09:14:17,990 --> 09:14:18,690
I can't.

11963
09:14:19,190 --> 09:14:20,750
I was gonna try to go for the touch.

11964
09:14:22,930 --> 09:14:24,690
I might be able to... aw.

11965
09:14:25,210 --> 09:14:26,330
Aw, that's fucked.

11966
09:14:29,590 --> 09:14:30,270
Aw.

11967
09:14:37,590 --> 09:14:38,490
That's fucked.

11968
09:14:41,990 --> 09:14:45,870
Neil tried taking my Psylocke after going 8 and 5.

11969
09:14:45,870 --> 09:14:46,850
Nuh-uh.

11970
09:14:47,110 --> 09:14:47,750
Nope.

11971
09:14:48,790 --> 09:14:53,130
I think he's just a... I think he's literally a Psylocke player.

11972
09:14:54,150 --> 09:14:55,550
I think he might terrorize.

11973
09:14:56,850 --> 09:14:58,410
I mean, I can.

11974
09:15:04,620 --> 09:15:06,700
Yeah, he fucking got you.

11975
09:15:09,780 --> 09:15:11,380
He fucking got you.

11976
09:15:13,800 --> 09:15:15,320
He terrorized you.

11977
09:15:15,560 --> 09:15:17,540
To be fair, he actually filled the last...

11978
09:15:17,540 --> 09:15:19,200
He filled last time we got him.

11979
09:15:19,820 --> 09:15:20,440
To be fair.

11980
09:15:21,640 --> 09:15:22,360
He took Luna.

11981
09:15:32,730 --> 09:15:36,410
This Mantis out-counter ults me, so like...

11982
09:15:36,410 --> 09:15:36,750
Yeah.

11983
09:15:37,890 --> 09:15:40,970
If I ult, she'll ult, so then you'll get your DPS ult after.

11984
09:15:52,780 --> 09:15:55,000
Is Captain America good on this map?

11985
09:15:55,000 --> 09:15:59,000
I don't know.

11986
09:15:59,000 --> 09:16:02,740
See that, Starlord?

11987
09:16:02,900 --> 09:16:04,040
Not for long, you don't.

11988
09:16:04,640 --> 09:16:06,000
What am I doing?

11989
09:16:07,300 --> 09:16:08,800
I don't know.

11990
09:16:10,020 --> 09:16:11,780
But I believe in you.

11991
09:16:12,140 --> 09:16:12,960
Thank you.

11992
09:16:14,020 --> 09:16:15,700
Okay, where is my HP?

11993
09:16:16,700 --> 09:16:17,360
Same.

11994
09:16:19,560 --> 09:16:21,480
I don't see.

11995
09:16:21,680 --> 09:16:23,560
You guys are like so far away.

11996
09:16:23,560 --> 09:16:25,240
Oh my god, he just got a heal.

11997
09:16:25,580 --> 09:16:26,000
Fuck.

11998
09:16:26,480 --> 09:16:27,360
Thought he was alone.

11999
09:16:28,420 --> 09:16:28,840
Okay.

12000
09:16:30,020 --> 09:16:32,040
You guys are way too far.

12001
09:16:32,740 --> 09:16:33,920
Like, you're everywhere.

12002
09:16:34,100 --> 09:16:35,800
So we couldn't... Adam and I couldn't do anything.

12003
09:16:36,620 --> 09:16:37,500
Can you touch or no?

12004
09:16:39,120 --> 09:16:39,540
Wait,

12005
09:16:50,330 --> 09:16:51,010
Mantis no sleep.

12006
09:16:54,130 --> 09:16:54,550
Nice.

12007
09:16:54,830 --> 09:16:56,990
But we can't help you there, though.

12008
09:16:57,070 --> 09:16:58,030
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

12009
09:16:58,030 --> 09:16:59,150
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

12010
09:16:59,570 --> 09:17:01,350
We have to fight closer.

12011
09:17:02,390 --> 09:17:04,150
They get so much free push.

12012
09:17:06,290 --> 09:17:06,810
Where was that?

12013
09:17:07,870 --> 09:17:09,430
I have to always use my heals.

12014
09:17:09,670 --> 09:17:10,830
I need to use this.

12015
09:17:14,550 --> 09:17:16,110
I had to use that.

12016
09:17:16,210 --> 09:17:16,950
We were so low.

12017
09:17:17,570 --> 09:17:18,530
I have to get picked here.

12018
09:17:19,850 --> 09:17:20,810
Oh no.

12019
09:17:21,090 --> 09:17:22,130
My HP evaporated.

12020
09:17:24,190 --> 09:17:25,130
That's unlucky.

12021
09:17:28,030 --> 09:17:29,650
If I didn't use it...

12022
09:17:29,650 --> 09:17:32,070
If I didn't use it, we'd all die there.

12023
09:17:33,230 --> 09:17:33,710
Yeah.

12024
09:17:39,700 --> 09:17:41,740
Okay, what do we avoid after this game?

12025
09:17:47,880 --> 09:17:49,500
I can't heal anybody.

12026
09:17:50,320 --> 09:17:51,080
I'm gonna heal on your right.

12027
09:17:51,460 --> 09:17:53,240
I don't have a lot of heals left.

12028
09:17:56,600 --> 09:17:57,600
They're slow, though.

12029
09:17:58,060 --> 09:17:59,880
Oh my god, they're so low.

12030
09:18:01,260 --> 09:18:02,260
I have nothing.

12031
09:18:03,940 --> 09:18:04,860
I'm about to melt.

12032
09:18:05,340 --> 09:18:06,100
I'm done.

12033
09:18:07,280 --> 09:18:08,860
I'm kicking them.

12034
09:18:10,960 --> 09:18:13,200
Oh my god, do we have rez?

12035
09:18:13,220 --> 09:18:14,580
We do, thanks guys.

12036
09:18:19,070 --> 09:18:21,070
I don't have enough heals for this.

12037
09:18:21,070 --> 09:18:23,290
I'm eating so much shit.

12038
09:18:23,950 --> 09:18:24,270
I know.

12039
09:18:24,990 --> 09:18:26,690
I literally just got my ult.

12040
09:18:28,530 --> 09:18:29,130
What?

12041
09:18:30,250 --> 09:18:31,070
No wait.

12042
09:18:31,870 --> 09:18:32,410
Hold up.

12043
09:18:34,290 --> 09:18:34,790
Assemble!

12044
09:18:36,850 --> 09:18:37,610
Oh my god.

12045
09:18:38,370 --> 09:18:40,430
I'm damage boosting you.

12046
09:18:42,290 --> 09:18:43,370
I'm assembling.

12047
09:18:44,250 --> 09:18:45,290
Oh my god.

12048
09:18:46,310 --> 09:18:48,630
There's assembling all over the point.

12049
09:18:49,990 --> 09:18:53,410
You guys are taking so much damage.

12050
09:18:55,410 --> 09:18:57,330
Oh my god.

12051
09:18:57,610 --> 09:18:58,770
I couldn't assemble hard enough.

12052
09:18:58,770 --> 09:19:00,670
I can't.

12053
09:19:00,710 --> 09:19:02,130
I can't do anything.

12054
09:19:03,710 --> 09:19:04,870
I'm trying to touch.

12055
09:19:05,090 --> 09:19:05,430
No.

12056
09:19:08,250 --> 09:19:10,830
I just had two tank players.

12057
09:19:11,390 --> 09:19:17,450
I just had two

12058
09:19:21,320 --> 09:19:22,360
tank players.

12059
09:19:24,390 --> 09:19:25,940
What do we do about that?

12060
09:19:30,010 --> 09:19:31,050
Oh thank god.

12061
09:19:31,050 --> 09:19:31,830
I almost...

12062
09:19:32,550 --> 09:19:34,570
I'm almost like...

12063
09:19:34,570 --> 09:19:35,570
Wait, do we avoid people?

12064
09:19:35,630 --> 09:19:36,290
We should avoid people.

12065
09:19:36,630 --> 09:19:36,930
Wait,

12066
09:19:39,990 --> 09:19:42,630
I'm negative 30 but I'm still GM 2?

12067
09:19:42,790 --> 09:19:43,250
How?

12068
09:19:44,350 --> 09:19:45,570
Oh you avoided me?

12069
09:19:45,610 --> 09:19:46,190
Alright.

12070
09:19:50,850 --> 09:19:53,730
Hey 42% accuracy.

12071
09:19:53,990 --> 09:19:54,670
Let's go.

12072
09:19:55,490 --> 09:19:56,850
Let's fucking go.

12073
09:19:57,750 --> 09:19:59,510
Never below 40.

12074
09:20:01,750 --> 09:20:09,830
One thing I don't understand is when Overwatch players would always name every account they have that's not Overwatch Overwatch at the end.

12075
09:20:09,830 --> 09:20:12,390
Why would you want to out yourself as an Overwatch player?

12076
09:20:12,390 --> 09:20:12,970
I don't understand.

12077
09:20:13,210 --> 09:20:14,490
We're in Marvel Rivals.

12078
09:20:14,810 --> 09:20:16,570
Why do you want to tell people you're from Overwatch?

12079
09:20:21,470 --> 09:20:22,990
There's no reason to.

12080
09:20:23,650 --> 09:20:25,350
It's so fucked up.

12081
09:20:25,790 --> 09:20:27,930
Like you just hate yourself I think.

12082
09:20:32,280 --> 09:20:32,940
Okay.

12083
09:20:33,960 --> 09:20:35,380
We have a tank player?

12084
09:20:35,580 --> 09:20:37,280
Or that guy was feeling...

12085
09:20:37,280 --> 09:20:38,440
Oh we have double tank.

12086
09:20:38,640 --> 09:20:40,680
The damn pocket link was the tank.

12087
09:20:40,940 --> 09:20:42,240
Played Thor really well.

12088
09:20:43,200 --> 09:20:43,620
Yeah!

12089
09:20:44,320 --> 09:20:45,000
Let's go!

12090
09:20:46,840 --> 09:20:50,700
Even our other guy was fed up with Neal last game.

12091
09:20:51,680 --> 09:20:55,780
If Neal randomly gets better, I'm gonna...

12092
09:20:55,780 --> 09:20:58,000
Even he was fed up!

12093
09:20:58,340 --> 09:20:58,580
Oh my god!

12094
09:20:58,580 --> 09:21:00,440
That's fucking hilarious.

12095
09:21:01,080 --> 09:21:02,280
Oh my god!

12096
09:21:02,340 --> 09:21:04,200
Even he knows what the problem was!

12097
09:21:12,420 --> 09:21:14,620
I'm gonna lose it.

12098
09:21:15,060 --> 09:21:15,820
Nice.

12099
09:21:17,280 --> 09:21:18,900
Alright, now who do we ban?

12100
09:21:19,500 --> 09:21:19,920
Banner?

12101
09:21:20,260 --> 09:21:20,720
Bruce?

12102
09:21:21,060 --> 09:21:21,480
Banner.

12103
09:21:24,260 --> 09:21:24,920
Thank god.

12104
09:21:24,920 --> 09:21:26,360
That means Hela might be free then.

12105
09:21:27,860 --> 09:21:28,640
That's fine.

12106
09:21:34,880 --> 09:21:36,020
Yeah, we win these.

12107
09:21:36,660 --> 09:21:37,040
Yeah.

12108
09:21:39,000 --> 09:21:39,760
Black Panther?

12109
09:21:40,040 --> 09:21:41,580
Where the fuck is a Panther player?

12110
09:21:41,700 --> 09:21:43,660
Dude, what's up with these Black Panther bans?

12111
09:21:48,300 --> 09:21:50,560
At least I get to go Shylock.

12112
09:21:50,960 --> 09:21:52,020
Mantis isn't banned.

12113
09:21:52,680 --> 09:21:53,240
Nice.

12114
09:21:55,060 --> 09:21:55,620
Nice.

12115
09:21:55,620 --> 09:21:55,780
Nice.

12116
09:22:01,220 --> 09:22:03,060
That's what I like to see.

12117
09:22:08,990 --> 09:22:12,970
Guys, after my Christmas stream, what if I just stream more Marvel Rivals?

12118
09:22:15,350 --> 09:22:18,130
I don't know.

12119
09:22:22,490 --> 09:22:27,990
What if I just do more DJM after my Christmas stream?

12120
09:22:27,990 --> 09:22:30,070
Oh my god, and my frames are good this game!

12121
09:22:33,350 --> 09:22:34,250
Alright, let's go.

12122
09:22:48,340 --> 09:22:51,660
I'm like counting how many hours of sleep I'm gonna get before my next stream.

12123
09:22:52,380 --> 09:22:54,700
And Neo might be on Hela, we're fine!

12124
09:22:55,300 --> 09:22:59,560
Oh my god, bro!

12125
09:23:00,800 --> 09:23:02,720
He does not like Neo.

12126
09:23:05,400 --> 09:23:05,940
Magneto!

12127
09:23:06,660 --> 09:23:07,680
What the fuck?

12128
09:23:08,240 --> 09:23:09,740
I just slept out of a dodge.

12129
09:23:12,300 --> 09:23:14,300
Oh my god, Ace is taking a lot of damage.

12130
09:23:14,460 --> 09:23:16,880
I'm trying to get in your LRS.

12131
09:23:17,760 --> 09:23:18,540
I got you.

12132
09:23:19,020 --> 09:23:22,220
I literally have to...

12133
09:23:22,220 --> 09:23:22,940
Punish her dead.

12134
09:23:24,900 --> 09:23:24,900
Neo!

12135
09:23:25,120 --> 09:23:26,660
You died to Neo!

12136
09:23:29,830 --> 09:23:31,790
You're gonna let Neo out Hela you?

12137
09:23:32,710 --> 09:23:33,990
I ain't even on Hela.

12138
09:23:34,250 --> 09:23:35,690
He got that.

12139
09:23:37,230 --> 09:23:37,790
Okay,

12140
09:23:41,510 --> 09:23:42,830
I'm going bottom real quick.

12141
09:23:45,010 --> 09:23:48,470
I'm just a little bit worried about the Hela.

12142
09:23:51,790 --> 09:23:52,910
Jesus Christ.

12143
09:23:55,470 --> 09:23:56,670
I literally have this guy.

12144
09:23:57,450 --> 09:23:58,930
Just teleported when I swung in.

12145
09:24:00,210 --> 09:24:01,570
There's some guy on high ground.

12146
09:24:01,690 --> 09:24:02,650
There's Neo on high ground.

12147
09:24:06,080 --> 09:24:06,840
Don't worry.

12148
09:24:08,320 --> 09:24:11,480
Oh my god, our Stalker Strange has a fucking vendetta against Neo.

12149
09:24:12,140 --> 09:24:13,940
This server is so fucking bad.

12150
09:24:16,980 --> 09:24:18,120
Oh my god.

12151
09:24:18,140 --> 09:24:18,900
This is West Coast.

12152
09:24:19,980 --> 09:24:22,660
I have 70 ping to West Coast.

12153
09:24:23,140 --> 09:24:27,440
It says I have 90 ping or 80 ping roughly.

12154
09:24:27,440 --> 09:24:27,960
It's Oregon.

12155
09:24:29,400 --> 09:24:31,300
That's not good.

12156
09:24:32,100 --> 09:24:33,440
That's not good.

12157
09:24:35,180 --> 09:24:36,160
I just need a little bit.

12158
09:24:36,540 --> 09:24:38,000
Oh my god.

12159
09:24:41,300 --> 09:24:42,280
Everything's fine.

12160
09:24:43,700 --> 09:24:47,720
Wait, can you tell them Luna, Mantis first.

12161
09:24:48,140 --> 09:24:48,760
Mantis ult first.

12162
09:24:50,140 --> 09:24:52,120
Luna, Mantis ult first, okay?

12163
09:24:53,240 --> 09:24:54,360
Don't do it first.

12164
09:24:55,360 --> 09:24:57,300
No, I said Mantis ult first.

12165
09:24:57,580 --> 09:25:00,660
Yeah, yeah.

12166
09:25:00,660 --> 09:25:01,820
There we go.

12167
09:25:02,360 --> 09:25:03,540
Oh shit, I didn't...

12168
09:25:03,540 --> 09:25:06,600
Oh my god, I didn't realize she was up there.

12169
09:25:08,220 --> 09:25:08,700
That's fine.

12170
09:25:10,500 --> 09:25:14,020
No, I didn't realize Hella was that close.

12171
09:25:14,120 --> 09:25:14,960
We can still fight this.

12172
09:25:15,080 --> 09:25:15,740
I have my Luna ult.

12173
09:25:16,620 --> 09:25:17,860
They use Luna ult.

12174
09:25:17,980 --> 09:25:18,580
It's recontestable.

12175
09:25:21,400 --> 09:25:24,180
I'm gonna I'm gonna go in with my Luna ult.

12176
09:25:26,420 --> 09:25:27,360
I'm going in now.

12177
09:25:27,940 --> 09:25:28,500
Okay, my man.

12178
09:25:29,080 --> 09:25:29,340
Go!

12179
09:25:30,380 --> 09:25:31,180
Let's go!

12180
09:25:31,840 --> 09:25:32,860
Have they used their ult?

12181
09:25:33,620 --> 09:25:34,660
I don't know.

12182
09:25:35,060 --> 09:25:36,180
I know they don't have Luna ult.

12183
09:25:36,280 --> 09:25:37,120
I know they don't have Luna ult.

12184
09:25:39,040 --> 09:25:40,100
I'm focusing Mantis.

12185
09:25:40,400 --> 09:25:40,660
Okay.

12186
09:25:42,320 --> 09:25:43,300
There's a Groot on point.

12187
09:25:44,980 --> 09:25:46,020
Stay on point though.

12188
09:25:47,180 --> 09:25:48,480
Oh my god, this is beautiful.

12189
09:25:50,480 --> 09:25:50,960
Okay.

12190
09:25:51,340 --> 09:25:51,820
Nice.

12191
09:25:56,480 --> 09:25:59,860
They have They have Groot ult.

12192
09:26:01,820 --> 09:26:02,420
Punisher top.

12193
09:26:03,640 --> 09:26:04,660
Wait, no, they don't.

12194
09:26:04,760 --> 09:26:05,960
They just swapped to Groot, right?

12195
09:26:06,960 --> 09:26:08,200
Um, no.

12196
09:26:08,240 --> 09:26:08,800
They were never Groot.

12197
09:26:09,680 --> 09:26:11,280
Oh, okay.

12198
09:26:11,540 --> 09:26:13,500
I felt like they were very non-existent as Groot.

12199
09:26:16,260 --> 09:26:16,640
Okay.

12200
09:26:16,640 --> 09:26:16,760
Okay.

12201
09:26:18,140 --> 09:26:19,420
Yeah, be ready for a Groot ult.

12202
09:26:20,880 --> 09:26:21,240
Okay.

12203
09:26:21,240 --> 09:26:22,760
I don't know if I have anything.

12204
09:26:23,640 --> 09:26:24,000
No!

12205
09:26:29,220 --> 09:26:30,520
I might be dead here.

12206
09:26:30,600 --> 09:26:31,240
I'm so low.

12207
09:26:31,880 --> 09:26:32,860
Can I help you, Ducky?

12208
09:26:33,760 --> 09:26:34,020
I don't.

12209
09:26:36,860 --> 09:26:37,680
That's a Groot ult.

12210
09:26:38,920 --> 09:26:39,200
Woah!

12211
09:26:40,800 --> 09:26:41,200
Mantis one!

12212
09:26:41,340 --> 09:26:41,600
Mantis one!

12213
09:26:41,660 --> 09:26:42,040
Mantis one!

12214
09:26:42,060 --> 09:26:42,540
I got Mantis.

12215
09:26:42,540 --> 09:26:44,540
I got it, I got it, I got it.

12216
09:26:46,040 --> 09:26:46,820
I got Neal.

12217
09:26:47,700 --> 09:26:48,800
We got Neal!

12218
09:26:48,960 --> 09:26:49,940
Let's fucking go!

12219
09:26:51,520 --> 09:26:53,280
I got Neal, nothing changed.

12220
09:26:54,320 --> 09:26:54,520
Okay.

12221
09:26:55,760 --> 09:26:56,700
They're walling.

12222
09:26:58,720 --> 09:26:59,580
Then I can die.

12223
09:27:00,420 --> 09:27:03,060
Oh my god, I have to fucking reload my head.

12224
09:27:03,980 --> 09:27:05,600
Oh my god, I got you!

12225
09:27:05,720 --> 09:27:06,340
I'm dancing!

12226
09:27:06,540 --> 09:27:07,100
I'm dancing!

12227
09:27:07,300 --> 09:27:08,380
I'm fucking dancing!

12228
09:27:08,600 --> 09:27:09,140
Let's go!

12229
09:27:09,400 --> 09:27:10,140
Let's go!

12230
09:27:10,140 --> 09:27:11,660
Keep shaking ass, you're doing great!

12231
09:27:11,920 --> 09:27:12,640
Let's go!

12232
09:27:13,200 --> 09:27:14,720
Look, watch me dance!

12233
09:27:20,920 --> 09:27:25,060
I've never whiffed my Psylocke ult harder than that.

12234
09:27:25,380 --> 09:27:28,240
I think I didn't see anything.

12235
09:27:28,860 --> 09:27:30,420
I was too busy dancing.

12236
09:27:33,020 --> 09:27:37,320
Luna has the goofiest ult I've ever seen in a fucking shooter game.

12237
09:27:37,320 --> 09:27:40,420
Sometimes I don't know if she's actually hitting her targets.

12238
09:27:42,160 --> 09:27:45,800
Her circle adder moves extremely fast or so slow.

12239
09:27:49,610 --> 09:27:53,470
I tried dashing and then ulting and then I didn't have dash.

12240
09:27:54,770 --> 09:27:57,870
I love that she dances for you.

12241
09:27:58,230 --> 09:27:59,930
It's just so funny to me.

12242
09:28:00,890 --> 09:28:02,110
It's such a meme.

12243
09:28:02,910 --> 09:28:04,530
I don't have to...

12244
09:28:04,530 --> 09:28:07,370
I'm not sad whenever I see her dance.

12245
09:28:10,090 --> 09:28:13,890
I wish Zenyatta would dance when he does his trance.

12246
09:28:17,270 --> 09:28:19,170
It just makes me so happy.

12247
09:28:20,350 --> 09:28:23,310
If only Zen can also dance when he does it.

12248
09:28:30,630 --> 09:28:35,930
It would make the game so much better if he just starts dancing when he trance.

12249
09:28:37,090 --> 09:28:39,090
Yeah, Zen just breaking it down.

12250
09:28:39,230 --> 09:28:40,050
It should be a skin.

12251
09:28:45,060 --> 09:28:50,980
I still love the fact that Ace was like I'm gonna fucking lose it and you'll get better at this game.

12252
09:28:52,280 --> 09:28:53,700
That was so funny.

12253
09:28:54,460 --> 09:28:56,960
That was actually so fucking funny.

12254
09:29:00,920 --> 09:29:03,940
It was just like, he knows who the weak link was too.

12255
09:29:08,910 --> 09:29:10,250
Jesus Christ.

12256
09:29:14,450 --> 09:29:16,590
They let us push this far?

12257
09:29:16,890 --> 09:29:17,890
Oh my god, Nioh!

12258
09:29:18,530 --> 09:29:20,310
Aw, Nioh was one.

12259
09:29:26,800 --> 09:29:28,080
What the fuck?

12260
09:29:28,100 --> 09:29:31,760
Penny is one too.

12261
09:29:32,480 --> 09:29:33,880
Oh my god.

12262
09:29:34,160 --> 09:29:36,560
They got it so fast.

12263
09:29:37,360 --> 09:29:38,220
It's crazy.

12264
09:29:39,300 --> 09:29:40,000
I have it too.

12265
09:29:41,360 --> 09:29:43,440
It's time for my turn to dance.

12266
09:29:43,820 --> 09:29:44,720
That's looking right.

12267
09:29:46,160 --> 09:29:47,780
That's looking right.

12268
09:29:48,720 --> 09:29:51,440
Nioh just tried TPing up to me to 1v1 me.

12269
09:29:53,660 --> 09:29:55,480
Good effort, good effort Nioh.

12270
09:29:55,520 --> 09:29:57,240
A little silly from Nioh.

12271
09:29:58,120 --> 09:29:58,640
Good effort.

12272
09:30:04,360 --> 09:30:06,040
Good job, guys.

12273
09:30:10,000 --> 09:30:11,820
Nioh, get off the game!

12274
09:30:12,200 --> 09:30:13,360
Oh my god!

12275
09:30:18,060 --> 09:30:21,460
This guy is a professional hater.

12276
09:30:21,660 --> 09:30:23,020
Holy shit.

12277
09:30:23,340 --> 09:30:25,240
I can't even blame him, Nioh deserves it.

12278
09:30:25,720 --> 09:30:26,760
So true.

12279
09:30:29,700 --> 09:30:31,140
Oh my god.

12280
09:30:31,580 --> 09:30:32,440
I get it.

12281
09:30:33,120 --> 09:30:34,280
He gets it.

12282
09:30:34,880 --> 09:30:36,920
Everyone wants him gone.

12283
09:30:37,400 --> 09:30:39,060
Oh my god, that poor guy.

12284
09:30:39,280 --> 09:30:42,040
This is how he spends his Christmas.

12285
09:30:49,260 --> 09:31:05,020
For those who want the character arc of Nioh, he was really bad at DPS on our last game, and then I think us and the tank avoided Nioh, and then the one time when we got a game, Ace was like, if Nioh randomly gets better, I'm gonna fucking lose it.

12286
09:31:07,380 --> 09:31:10,540
And then, a bitch troll not to go hella here.

12287
09:31:10,960 --> 09:31:13,240
Nioh might be on hella work fine.

12288
09:31:13,480 --> 09:31:17,240
The thing is, he didn't say anything before.

12289
09:31:17,760 --> 09:31:22,720
He had said nothing about Nioh before in last game.

12290
09:31:23,080 --> 09:31:24,380
It was just...

12291
09:31:24,380 --> 09:31:25,220
It was...

12292
09:31:26,440 --> 09:31:33,380
When we got to this game, he fucking went full on straight hater.

12293
09:31:33,760 --> 09:31:37,120
We didn't know how much Ace hated Nioh until now.

12294
09:31:39,120 --> 09:31:42,280
He literally said nothing last game.

12295
09:31:42,620 --> 09:31:47,020
And in this game, he was like, oh my god, I fucking hate you, Nioh.

12296
09:31:54,500 --> 09:31:56,500
Get off the game.

12297
09:31:57,180 --> 09:32:00,760
I can't believe he was silent hating Nioh in the last game.

12298
09:32:00,960 --> 09:32:07,980
It was so much... He had all that hate within himself, trying to keep it in until he goes on the enemy team.

12299
09:32:09,260 --> 09:32:13,040
I think... Oh my god, that was crazy when he was like...

12300
09:32:15,100 --> 09:32:20,520
I love how... I don't know if it's the sleep deprivation or like, Nioh might be on hella, so we're fine.

12301
09:32:25,420 --> 09:32:28,660
Thank you for the tier 1 sub and the prime.

12302
09:32:28,720 --> 09:32:30,140
I really appreciate it.

12303
09:32:30,140 --> 09:32:32,880
Bro, waited for this one moment.

12304
09:32:32,980 --> 09:32:34,780
Yeah, he fucking waited for that.

12305
09:32:36,780 --> 09:32:38,180
John, thank you for giving us sub.

12306
09:32:38,340 --> 09:32:39,400
Tier 1 sub to Thunder.

12307
09:32:39,840 --> 09:32:40,700
Appreciate it.

12308
09:32:40,840 --> 09:32:41,560
Thank you.

12309
09:32:44,320 --> 09:32:44,860
Yeah!

12310
09:32:47,700 --> 09:32:48,820
It was waiting for you.

12311
09:32:49,400 --> 09:32:51,080
Oh my god, this is a diamond game.

12312
09:32:53,460 --> 09:32:56,920
Oh my god, we have a diamond game.

12313
09:32:58,040 --> 09:33:00,420
And they're like, we can't find anybody here.

12314
09:33:00,700 --> 09:33:02,720
Okay, if we lose this, we lose a lot.

12315
09:33:02,800 --> 09:33:04,560
Because we're in a diamond game, just saying.

12316
09:33:04,980 --> 09:33:05,680
No, we just lose.

12317
09:33:06,640 --> 09:33:08,220
The Smegma Smuggler.

12318
09:33:09,340 --> 09:33:10,780
What a gamer.

12319
09:33:14,940 --> 09:33:16,600
Do you think they'll both fail for...

12320
09:33:16,600 --> 09:33:18,220
We have Asianlover69.

12321
09:33:23,180 --> 09:33:26,120
He's not shy but look, he loves.

12322
09:33:28,760 --> 09:33:34,520
Look at these names, welcome to competitive shooters.

12323
09:33:39,380 --> 09:33:41,500
Daniel is not doing a lot.

12324
09:33:43,340 --> 09:33:44,540
These motherfuckers!

12325
09:33:45,840 --> 09:33:47,540
Five names in a row!

12326
09:33:47,880 --> 09:33:49,640
I'm doing Bruce.

12327
09:33:57,640 --> 09:33:58,740
I love Daniel.

12328
09:33:58,980 --> 09:34:04,980
I love how, as a stack, we're just trying to control the queues.

12329
09:34:07,040 --> 09:34:10,140
Oh my god, these guys are such bums.

12330
09:34:10,300 --> 09:34:15,160
To be fair, I won't be surprised if they're stream sniping me.

12331
09:34:15,460 --> 09:34:19,620
If they're stream sniping me, because I'm like, number 5th right now on Marvel Rivals.

12332
09:34:20,080 --> 09:34:22,220
They can literally boot up the stream.

12333
09:34:24,080 --> 09:34:27,560
They can literally open up my directory and just see me.

12334
09:34:34,800 --> 09:34:36,280
Yeah, I'm in Canada, bro.

12335
09:34:38,940 --> 09:34:40,280
Yeah, it's crazy.

12336
09:34:40,520 --> 09:34:41,800
I'm fish right now.

12337
09:34:44,240 --> 09:34:46,800
I tend to confuse people.

12338
09:34:49,700 --> 09:34:49,920
Alright.

12339
09:34:50,940 --> 09:34:52,520
I give it...

12340
09:34:52,520 --> 09:34:53,940
Why do we have Captain America?

12341
09:34:54,240 --> 09:34:55,720
It's not even like it's recent.

12342
09:34:55,880 --> 09:34:57,160
It's like you've been there for a while.

12343
09:35:00,980 --> 09:35:02,340
Look at that.

12344
09:35:05,320 --> 09:35:08,860
I didn't give all my left big game.

12345
09:35:09,340 --> 09:35:10,320
Holy shit.

12346
09:35:18,740 --> 09:35:20,980
Bro is bad ass.

12347
09:35:21,240 --> 09:35:23,260
Dude just reminded him of his trauma.

12348
09:35:23,280 --> 09:35:24,380
No, I did back in the day.

12349
09:35:24,760 --> 09:35:25,800
Holy shit.

12350
09:35:27,340 --> 09:35:31,620
I can't believe they banned my fucking Psylocke, bro.

12351
09:35:32,020 --> 09:35:33,320
We just got double targeted.

12352
09:35:33,740 --> 09:35:34,040
Yeah.

12353
09:35:34,060 --> 09:35:37,180
You gotta teach them a lesson they don't forget.

12354
09:35:37,600 --> 09:35:38,900
You play everything else.

12355
09:35:38,900 --> 09:35:41,940
It doesn't matter if you ban my Psylocke, I'll just be unhappy and I'll steal shit on you.

12356
09:35:43,720 --> 09:35:44,700
Oh wait, they have Groot.

12357
09:35:44,840 --> 09:35:46,440
Oh, I'm gonna shotgun the shit out of this guy.

12358
09:35:47,720 --> 09:35:48,600
They have Groot.

12359
09:35:49,660 --> 09:35:50,320
They have Groot.

12360
09:35:51,020 --> 09:35:52,420
I'm putting this on the fucking Groot.

12361
09:35:52,420 --> 09:35:54,680
I feel like out of all of them, Groot is the feediest.

12362
09:35:57,460 --> 09:35:58,960
Nevermind, I should put on Captain America.

12363
09:35:59,200 --> 09:36:00,520
God, I love having a shotgun.

12364
09:36:04,340 --> 09:36:04,760
Okay.

12365
09:36:05,700 --> 09:36:07,140
The hell is just looking at me?

12366
09:36:08,540 --> 09:36:08,980
Alright.

12367
09:36:09,320 --> 09:36:11,580
I'm putting it on Captain America.

12368
09:36:12,520 --> 09:36:13,420
Oh, I'm frozen.

12369
09:36:15,160 --> 09:36:15,600
Nice.

12370
09:36:17,240 --> 09:36:17,980
Oh wait, yeah.

12371
09:36:18,100 --> 09:36:19,040
Hella's not banned.

12372
09:36:19,040 --> 09:36:19,820
Yeah.

12373
09:36:20,240 --> 09:36:22,180
Wait, you could've played Hella this entire time.

12374
09:36:23,020 --> 09:36:23,380
No.

12375
09:36:25,840 --> 09:36:27,720
You could've played Hella this entire time.

12376
09:36:33,140 --> 09:36:34,520
Alright, I have no idea.

12377
09:36:36,700 --> 09:36:38,640
Someone in my chat was like, in love with you, Mac.

12378
09:36:38,740 --> 09:36:39,800
Bro, this is my chat.

12379
09:36:40,920 --> 09:36:42,700
Nah, that's so real of them.

12380
09:36:44,020 --> 09:36:45,560
That's so fucking real of them.

12381
09:36:45,580 --> 09:36:47,380
Guys, Alpernator has his own stream, guys.

12382
09:36:47,380 --> 09:36:51,060
You can tell it to him on his own stream.

12383
09:36:51,920 --> 09:36:52,440
Oh, that's huge.

12384
09:36:52,620 --> 09:36:52,860
That's huge.

12385
09:36:52,900 --> 09:36:53,480
That's actually huge.

12386
09:36:53,540 --> 09:36:53,920
That's huge.

12387
09:36:55,220 --> 09:36:56,280
Oh my god.

12388
09:36:58,140 --> 09:36:58,580
Oh,

12389
09:37:04,060 --> 09:37:05,100
I can ult after this?

12390
09:37:05,120 --> 09:37:05,600
You can ult.

12391
09:37:06,140 --> 09:37:07,180
Oh, after this.

12392
09:37:09,380 --> 09:37:10,560
Dope, that's fine.

12393
09:37:10,700 --> 09:37:11,100
That's fine.

12394
09:37:11,140 --> 09:37:12,140
I'm bodyblocking this.

12395
09:37:12,220 --> 09:37:12,800
That's fine.

12396
09:37:13,860 --> 09:37:15,580
Oh my god, I fell.

12397
09:37:15,580 --> 09:37:18,140
No shot, there's a giant pillar here.

12398
09:37:18,260 --> 09:37:19,500
Why is there a pillar here?

12399
09:37:19,600 --> 09:37:20,680
I'm sliding, I'm moving.

12400
09:37:21,380 --> 09:37:24,240
Dude, that pillar has fucked me over so many times.

12401
09:37:26,420 --> 09:37:27,200
Strange, can die.

12402
09:37:28,240 --> 09:37:29,420
I'm gonna slap him if I have to.

12403
09:37:30,840 --> 09:37:34,720
Dude, I am legit just spamming my shock wards.

12404
09:37:35,620 --> 09:37:36,120
We're fine.

12405
09:37:36,300 --> 09:37:36,880
We're so fine.

12406
09:37:36,980 --> 09:37:37,540
We're so healthy.

12407
09:37:41,460 --> 09:37:42,500
We're so healthy.

12408
09:37:42,500 --> 09:37:42,620
We're so healthy.

12409
09:37:44,840 --> 09:37:46,500
I've legit just been using...

12410
09:37:47,400 --> 09:37:48,760
Somebody's probably gonna accept the name.

12411
09:37:51,080 --> 09:37:52,300
Oh, Groot.

12412
09:37:53,700 --> 09:37:54,760
Oh, Captain.

12413
09:37:55,620 --> 09:37:56,900
He's going American.

12414
09:38:00,020 --> 09:38:01,580
I'm like, really worried.

12415
09:38:01,880 --> 09:38:02,160
Yeah, they're bad.

12416
09:38:04,040 --> 09:38:05,160
Strange one, strange one.

12417
09:38:05,400 --> 09:38:08,240
Oh my god, I fucked that one guy in particular.

12418
09:38:09,760 --> 09:38:10,280
Rocks.

12419
09:38:12,560 --> 09:38:13,720
Our cat might die.

12420
09:38:16,820 --> 09:38:18,320
I'm not using my ult.

12421
09:38:18,740 --> 09:38:20,780
Oh, that's a really good ult for us.

12422
09:38:20,840 --> 09:38:21,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12423
09:38:22,280 --> 09:38:24,200
I knew he was gonna use more.

12424
09:38:26,780 --> 09:38:30,260
Oh yeah, tell our Mantis he ults first, I'll ult later.

12425
09:38:31,320 --> 09:38:32,740
I wanna keep my Luna if we can.

12426
09:38:33,780 --> 09:38:35,220
That he ults first?

12427
09:38:35,320 --> 09:38:36,020
Yeah, he ults first.

12428
09:38:36,360 --> 09:38:38,200
I'm keeping my Luna ult, because it's better.

12429
09:38:42,280 --> 09:38:44,120
It's better for the next round when we have Luna.

12430
09:38:45,760 --> 09:38:46,560
Yeah, cycle him.

12431
09:38:46,620 --> 09:38:48,120
I'm down with that.

12432
09:38:53,850 --> 09:38:55,170
Alright, here we go.

12433
09:38:57,690 --> 09:38:58,990
That Raccoon wants to die.

12434
09:38:59,690 --> 09:39:01,090
Alright, here we go!

12435
09:39:01,250 --> 09:39:02,430
Here we go!

12436
09:39:02,710 --> 09:39:04,290
We don't die to this!

12437
09:39:05,950 --> 09:39:08,270
Didn't get a chance to save my ult, but that's fine.

12438
09:39:10,230 --> 09:39:12,610
They respawned Spider-Man.

12439
09:39:13,030 --> 09:39:13,930
I was in the air.

12440
09:39:15,350 --> 09:39:17,990
I'm trying to keep you up, but I don't know if I can.

12441
09:39:18,490 --> 09:39:19,110
I killed Iron Man.

12442
09:39:24,420 --> 09:39:25,620
That's huge, that's a huge ult.

12443
09:39:26,540 --> 09:39:27,520
That was a huge ult.

12444
09:39:27,580 --> 09:39:28,580
Oh no.

12445
09:39:31,920 --> 09:39:33,180
We have to reset.

12446
09:39:33,380 --> 09:39:34,380
I don't think we win this.

12447
09:39:35,500 --> 09:39:35,900
Wow.

12448
09:39:37,600 --> 09:39:39,140
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

12449
09:39:39,140 --> 09:39:41,440
Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't think we win that.

12450
09:39:47,610 --> 09:39:49,710
I didn't realize that so many of us died.

12451
09:39:49,790 --> 09:39:50,990
I thought we still had like 5 up.

12452
09:39:51,410 --> 09:39:52,050
Yeah, yeah.

12453
09:39:52,210 --> 09:39:53,730
We had to regroup.

12454
09:39:54,890 --> 09:39:56,490
This is like our last fight.

12455
09:39:58,090 --> 09:39:59,270
So we can't die here.

12456
09:40:02,630 --> 09:40:04,890
I need to make sure we're all...

12457
09:40:05,770 --> 09:40:06,170
No.

12458
09:40:07,630 --> 09:40:08,570
He's using heals.

12459
09:40:08,570 --> 09:40:09,330
He used a mirror kill.

12460
09:40:13,070 --> 09:40:14,030
Oh no.

12461
09:40:15,370 --> 09:40:16,170
I've only killed one.

12462
09:40:16,770 --> 09:40:17,070
Nice.

12463
09:40:17,710 --> 09:40:18,690
I have my ult here too.

12464
09:40:19,410 --> 09:40:21,330
I'm gonna use it right after.

12465
09:40:25,230 --> 09:40:26,270
I'm using it now.

12466
09:40:28,110 --> 09:40:29,070
I don't know where he just went.

12467
09:40:32,370 --> 09:40:34,090
We had to get something.

12468
09:40:34,090 --> 09:40:35,470
Can I just come back?

12469
09:40:36,490 --> 09:40:37,910
Oh no way.

12470
09:40:38,050 --> 09:40:38,990
I love headshotting.

12471
09:40:39,970 --> 09:40:40,770
I couldn't.

12472
09:40:47,350 --> 09:40:48,310
That's unlucky.

12473
09:40:55,080 --> 09:40:56,620
Need this 100 men killed.

12474
09:40:56,960 --> 09:40:57,440
Please.

12475
09:40:58,260 --> 09:40:59,500
The rest of my coffee.

12476
09:41:02,400 --> 09:41:04,360
Oh my god, that's so lucky.

12477
09:41:04,940 --> 09:41:06,700
I'm talking to this guy with like 1 HP and he flies away.

12478
09:41:06,920 --> 09:41:07,860
I'm begging you guys.

12479
09:41:12,320 --> 09:41:12,900
I literally just saw him.

12480
09:41:12,900 --> 09:41:13,360
Okay, but a bug.

12481
09:41:13,440 --> 09:41:14,700
I just haven't seen that guy.

12482
09:41:15,080 --> 09:41:16,320
I think I just saw him.

12483
09:41:17,640 --> 09:41:19,060
Yeah, I literally just saw him.

12484
09:41:28,060 --> 09:41:29,380
Oh sorry, whoops.

12485
09:41:32,660 --> 09:41:35,340
I pre-answered yours.

12486
09:41:36,680 --> 09:41:38,400
I'm stream sniping them.

12487
09:41:40,440 --> 09:41:42,760
I helped you answer your question.

12488
09:41:48,720 --> 09:41:50,220
Oh my god.

12489
09:41:57,400 --> 09:42:01,480
I'm going to put on Captain America.

12490
09:42:02,480 --> 09:42:04,780
Because I feel like he's going to fucking die.

12491
09:42:04,800 --> 09:42:07,320
Oh, this is going to be a really bad map for Iron Man.

12492
09:42:09,340 --> 09:42:10,800
I mean, he doesn't have Hulk.

12493
09:42:10,940 --> 09:42:13,300
So he shouldn't be too...

12494
09:42:15,660 --> 09:42:16,600
Oh, I see you, I see you.

12495
09:42:17,820 --> 09:42:18,920
I... oh my god.

12496
09:42:18,980 --> 09:42:20,240
I can't save him though.

12497
09:42:23,200 --> 09:42:24,840
I'm trying to group behind you.

12498
09:42:24,960 --> 09:42:25,740
Group behind you, group behind you.

12499
09:42:25,800 --> 09:42:28,080
Oh shit, well I got my one.

12500
09:42:31,260 --> 09:42:32,580
I'm being ran at by a strange.

12501
09:42:33,560 --> 09:42:34,100
I'm in the air.

12502
09:42:35,000 --> 09:42:35,860
Please, please don't...

12503
09:42:35,860 --> 09:42:37,760
I'm trying to, I'm trying to, I'm trying to.

12504
09:42:37,900 --> 09:42:40,020
I had to look at Captain America.

12505
09:42:40,960 --> 09:42:41,500
Oh no.

12506
09:42:42,840 --> 09:42:44,680
I think we might die though, maybe?

12507
09:42:46,360 --> 09:42:47,240
Yeah, unless...

12508
09:42:47,240 --> 09:42:48,760
Oh, they haven't capped it yet, they haven't capped it.

12509
09:42:49,140 --> 09:42:50,160
Strange one, strange one.

12510
09:42:50,260 --> 09:42:53,780
I got strange, I got strange.

12511
09:42:53,800 --> 09:42:55,080
Hella close right, hella close right.

12512
09:42:57,760 --> 09:42:58,420
Shotgun time.

12513
09:42:58,440 --> 09:43:00,560
Someone shoot the Iron Man, please.

12514
09:43:01,320 --> 09:43:02,000
He's one.

12515
09:43:02,300 --> 09:43:03,340
I got him.

12516
09:43:06,140 --> 09:43:06,580
Alright.

12517
09:43:06,580 --> 09:43:06,740
Okay.

12518
09:43:10,160 --> 09:43:11,060
This is fine.

12519
09:43:14,430 --> 09:43:16,010
They have, they use Groot ult.

12520
09:43:16,510 --> 09:43:18,090
But they have Raccoon ult.

12521
09:43:19,870 --> 09:43:21,490
I can't see our Captain America.

12522
09:43:21,950 --> 09:43:22,250
Fucking hell.

12523
09:43:22,650 --> 09:43:25,530
Our Captain America scares me.

12524
09:43:29,620 --> 09:43:30,340
Nice.

12525
09:43:32,620 --> 09:43:36,000
Our Captain America scares me so fucking much.

12526
09:43:37,920 --> 09:43:40,280
I have to fight this.

12527
09:43:40,280 --> 09:43:40,800
I have to fight this here.

12528
09:43:44,820 --> 09:43:46,560
Oh man, I got frozen.

12529
09:43:46,940 --> 09:43:48,460
I stalled as long as I can.

12530
09:43:48,740 --> 09:43:50,140
But I'm gonna die on the point.

12531
09:43:57,900 --> 09:43:59,900
Oh, I stalled for so long though.

12532
09:44:00,660 --> 09:44:01,760
We still have point, we still have point.

12533
09:44:01,860 --> 09:44:02,920
Just die on point if you can.

12534
09:44:04,780 --> 09:44:06,060
Don't leave point, please.

12535
09:44:07,660 --> 09:44:09,680
Don't let my efforts go unnoticed.

12536
09:44:10,480 --> 09:44:11,820
Honestly, I come back with my ult.

12537
09:44:11,880 --> 09:44:12,520
We can win this.

12538
09:44:13,720 --> 09:44:14,540
Oh no!

12539
09:44:15,360 --> 09:44:16,140
Nah, okay, nevermind.

12540
09:44:22,090 --> 09:44:23,270
Oh, I'm not dying.

12541
09:44:23,490 --> 09:44:24,190
Gotta wait for Groot.

12542
09:44:24,190 --> 09:44:24,850
Actually, I got you.

12543
09:44:27,610 --> 09:44:28,350
I'm trying to keep...

12544
09:44:28,350 --> 09:44:30,330
I can't wait for them to fix this crosshair shit.

12545
09:44:32,850 --> 09:44:33,790
I got you.

12546
09:44:38,580 --> 09:44:39,620
I have it on...

12547
09:44:39,620 --> 09:44:40,540
Oh, we have Thor now.

12548
09:44:41,880 --> 09:44:44,620
How does one...

12549
09:44:46,120 --> 09:44:46,660
Please.

12550
09:44:47,240 --> 09:44:48,580
Oh my god.

12551
09:44:54,320 --> 09:44:54,860
Okay.

12552
09:44:55,440 --> 09:44:56,620
That is...

12553
09:44:57,300 --> 09:44:57,860
Don't care.

12554
09:44:58,920 --> 09:44:59,980
Don't care.

12555
09:45:00,380 --> 09:45:01,760
Groot, focus on Groot first.

12556
09:45:01,920 --> 09:45:02,840
Oh no.

12557
09:45:05,220 --> 09:45:06,160
I might be dead to this.

12558
09:45:06,300 --> 09:45:06,520
No.

12559
09:45:07,220 --> 09:45:08,420
We have no supports.

12560
09:45:08,680 --> 09:45:11,420
We have Mantis, but he's trying to LOS.

12561
09:45:11,420 --> 09:45:11,880
I already killed the...

12562
09:45:11,880 --> 09:45:12,520
Hello.

12563
09:45:15,220 --> 09:45:15,560
Nice.

12564
09:45:15,960 --> 09:45:17,500
I'm coming over with ult.

12565
09:45:18,540 --> 09:45:19,600
Thankfully, I have a shotgun.

12566
09:45:20,300 --> 09:45:21,680
Thankfully, I have a shotgun!

12567
09:45:22,060 --> 09:45:22,460
Thank god.

12568
09:45:25,460 --> 09:45:26,980
LOS our Mantis if you can.

12569
09:45:32,830 --> 09:45:34,210
I got you, Mac.

12570
09:45:42,490 --> 09:45:43,770
Okay, nice.

12571
09:45:45,530 --> 09:45:47,230
They're walking left.

12572
09:45:47,710 --> 09:45:48,030
Okay.

12573
09:45:48,030 --> 09:45:49,030
Okay.

12574
09:45:49,350 --> 09:45:50,510
Thank you for letting me know.

12575
09:46:02,220 --> 09:46:03,520
Jesus Christ.

12576
09:46:04,200 --> 09:46:05,420
I have to use this.

12577
09:46:06,280 --> 09:46:07,920
We were all so low.

12578
09:46:08,280 --> 09:46:08,600
Bye.

12579
09:46:08,980 --> 09:46:09,700
No!

12580
09:46:10,440 --> 09:46:12,340
I couldn't get out of that.

12581
09:46:13,700 --> 09:46:15,380
We were down three, though.

12582
09:46:16,620 --> 09:46:18,160
We should reset.

12583
09:46:22,380 --> 09:46:23,820
It's fine.

12584
09:46:23,820 --> 09:46:24,180
It's fine.

12585
09:46:24,240 --> 09:46:25,680
We have one fire here.

12586
09:46:26,400 --> 09:46:27,140
They have...

12587
09:46:27,140 --> 09:46:28,780
They have I.

12588
09:46:29,720 --> 09:46:30,860
And they have...

12589
09:46:30,860 --> 09:46:31,640
I don't know if they have Luna.

12590
09:46:31,900 --> 09:46:33,040
I think they have Luna ult, too.

12591
09:46:35,180 --> 09:46:36,060
Yeah, they did.

12592
09:46:36,180 --> 09:46:37,160
They have Hello ult and I.

12593
09:46:37,720 --> 09:46:38,340
And Luna.

12594
09:46:52,100 --> 09:46:53,360
I froze Iron Man!

12595
09:46:53,940 --> 09:46:54,440
I killed him.

12596
09:46:56,900 --> 09:46:57,380
Nice.

12597
09:46:59,220 --> 09:47:00,160
I'm shooting it.

12598
09:47:01,140 --> 09:47:01,700
He's low.

12599
09:47:01,740 --> 09:47:01,880
He's low.

12600
09:47:02,000 --> 09:47:02,980
No way she's one!

12601
09:47:05,360 --> 09:47:06,180
I can't.

12602
09:47:06,220 --> 09:47:07,100
I won't be able to grab.

12603
09:47:07,760 --> 09:47:08,500
I'm ulting.

12604
09:47:10,180 --> 09:47:11,160
No, I used everything.

12605
09:47:17,500 --> 09:47:18,180
That's huge.

12606
09:47:18,680 --> 09:47:19,400
That's huge.

12607
09:47:20,280 --> 09:47:21,960
No, I got eyed!

12608
09:47:23,240 --> 09:47:25,080
Oh no, I got eyed.

12609
09:47:25,220 --> 09:47:25,980
There's two of you there.

12610
09:47:26,020 --> 09:47:26,480
I come back.

12611
09:47:27,940 --> 09:47:29,580
I got eyed.

12612
09:47:29,660 --> 09:47:30,880
I killed both supports.

12613
09:47:31,080 --> 09:47:32,120
I did all I could.

12614
09:47:33,820 --> 09:47:34,400
Are Thor...

12615
09:47:34,400 --> 09:47:36,000
It's just Thor, though.

12616
09:47:36,720 --> 09:47:38,560
I don't think he lives that.

12617
09:47:39,160 --> 09:47:39,640
He's got...

12618
09:47:39,640 --> 09:47:41,560
No, he ulted and he put him off point.

12619
09:47:41,760 --> 09:47:42,820
He left point!

12620
09:47:44,040 --> 09:47:45,300
All he did was ult.

12621
09:47:45,400 --> 09:47:47,400
He would have killed them both in one with that ult, too.

12622
09:47:47,480 --> 09:47:48,720
Oh my god.

12623
09:47:49,840 --> 09:47:50,280
GG.

12624
09:47:52,640 --> 09:47:53,520
He ulted.

12625
09:47:53,520 --> 09:47:54,680
That's unfortunate.

12626
09:47:56,420 --> 09:47:57,860
Oh my god.

12627
09:47:58,080 --> 09:47:59,500
I hope they fix that.

12628
09:47:59,760 --> 09:48:00,740
That sure has to count.

12629
09:48:02,460 --> 09:48:05,360
That's actually crazy that he ulted that.

12630
09:48:07,860 --> 09:48:08,980
Jesus Christ.

12631
09:48:09,860 --> 09:48:11,180
Are there... do you rank there?

12632
09:48:11,520 --> 09:48:12,480
Did I do rank on that?

12633
09:48:13,180 --> 09:48:13,620
No!

12634
09:48:15,920 --> 09:48:16,960
No, I didn't!

12635
09:48:17,420 --> 09:48:18,480
Oh my god, I did it!

12636
09:48:18,600 --> 09:48:20,260
I just sucked the edge.

12637
09:48:20,260 --> 09:48:24,040
That's why I said the diamond queues are bad.

12638
09:48:24,840 --> 09:48:26,120
That was rough.

12639
09:48:27,120 --> 09:48:27,920
Oh my god.

12640
09:48:28,000 --> 09:48:29,660
I'm literally at zero points.

12641
09:48:30,240 --> 09:48:32,580
I'm literally at zero points.

12642
09:48:33,920 --> 09:48:37,000
I need to win two games in a row to be back to GM2.

12643
09:48:38,000 --> 09:48:39,960
Bro, these games have been rough, though.

12644
09:48:41,080 --> 09:48:42,920
Okay, if we win this next one, I'm out.

12645
09:48:43,580 --> 09:48:45,040
No, we need to win two.

12646
09:48:45,800 --> 09:48:48,080
Okay, if we win the next two, I'm out.

12647
09:48:48,080 --> 09:48:49,020
Okay, okay, okay.

12648
09:48:49,440 --> 09:48:50,460
When we win the next two.

12649
09:48:51,000 --> 09:48:52,220
If we don't.

12650
09:48:52,600 --> 09:48:53,900
If we win one...

12651
09:48:53,900 --> 09:48:54,500
There is no if.

12652
09:48:54,860 --> 09:48:55,720
When we win both.

12653
09:48:56,160 --> 09:48:57,880
Okay, Mac, what's your ideal?

12654
09:48:58,020 --> 09:48:59,780
What's your ideal situation here?

12655
09:49:01,540 --> 09:49:01,860
Huh?

12656
09:49:01,940 --> 09:49:02,960
My brain was off.

12657
09:49:03,000 --> 09:49:03,840
I didn't hear shit.

12658
09:49:04,360 --> 09:49:05,360
We talking about getting off?

12659
09:49:05,600 --> 09:49:06,560
Oh my god.

12660
09:49:06,680 --> 09:49:07,760
Wait, Mac, are you done?

12661
09:49:08,580 --> 09:49:08,900
Huh?

12662
09:49:09,020 --> 09:49:09,320
No.

12663
09:49:09,820 --> 09:49:10,460
You're not.

12664
09:49:11,760 --> 09:49:14,280
Okay, if we win two, I'm out.

12665
09:49:14,580 --> 09:49:15,500
I'm fucking... I'm out.

12666
09:49:16,600 --> 09:49:17,160
I'm out.

12667
09:49:17,340 --> 09:49:18,520
I'm out for the day.

12668
09:49:32,780 --> 09:49:34,880
Bro, we're not going to Zineful.

12669
09:49:35,020 --> 09:49:36,420
Bro, I bumped into the Zineful.

12670
09:49:36,620 --> 09:49:38,400
And he was at his 24 hour mark.

12671
09:49:38,600 --> 09:49:40,120
And apparently, I broke his last streak.

12672
09:49:40,260 --> 09:49:41,540
Like, that shit was so depressing.

12673
09:49:42,740 --> 09:49:45,940
He got off at 29 hours, apparently.

12674
09:49:45,940 --> 09:49:49,580
He was Eternity yesterday, Mac.

12675
09:49:49,680 --> 09:49:52,080
Yeah, he said he went from Eternity to D1.

12676
09:49:52,460 --> 09:49:53,880
Back to GM2 before he got off.

12677
09:49:53,880 --> 09:49:56,240
They have a Pope on their team, dude.

12678
09:49:56,360 --> 09:49:56,940
The Pope.

12679
09:49:57,040 --> 09:49:58,160
Oh my gosh, the Pope.

12680
09:49:58,960 --> 09:50:01,320
Like, I'm not...

12681
09:50:01,320 --> 09:50:03,040
We're not going full Zineful.

12682
09:50:05,700 --> 09:50:06,820
I'm Luna Snow.

12683
09:50:07,400 --> 09:50:09,100
Whoa, a magic player.

12684
09:50:09,280 --> 09:50:09,760
I shine in darkness.

12685
09:50:10,820 --> 09:50:13,360
His name's Saber, so you know they've gotta be good.

12686
09:50:18,180 --> 09:50:18,800
Man,

12687
09:50:24,600 --> 09:50:26,200
that game really hurt.

12688
09:50:26,440 --> 09:50:27,340
Like, extra.

12689
09:50:29,260 --> 09:50:30,700
We win these next two.

12690
09:50:31,900 --> 09:50:34,880
So fucked up they target banned both of our characters.

12691
09:50:34,960 --> 09:50:36,180
And then they won.

12692
09:50:38,480 --> 09:50:40,420
Okay, to be fair.

12693
09:50:41,640 --> 09:50:42,380
Okay.

12694
09:50:42,380 --> 09:50:43,960
Everybody, we can flex.

12695
09:50:44,520 --> 09:50:46,560
I've shown that I can flex to a tank.

12696
09:50:52,380 --> 09:50:53,860
We got Luna?

12697
09:50:54,460 --> 09:50:56,040
Okay, I'm banning Bruce Banner.

12698
09:50:56,760 --> 09:50:58,460
Fuck no defensive ults.

12699
09:50:59,020 --> 09:51:01,240
This shit's fucking hard as fuck.

12700
09:51:09,760 --> 09:51:10,500
Alright.

12701
09:51:20,420 --> 09:51:21,580
Guys, what the fuck you mean?

12702
09:51:21,700 --> 09:51:22,320
Oh god, dude.

12703
09:51:22,440 --> 09:51:24,860
I literally won on my one tank game today.

12704
09:51:25,020 --> 09:51:26,440
I literally won that game.

12705
09:51:26,960 --> 09:51:27,420
Alright guys.

12706
09:51:27,720 --> 09:51:29,660
Most likely, if we win this, I'm out.

12707
09:51:30,780 --> 09:51:32,000
I'm not even gonna...

12708
09:51:32,000 --> 09:51:34,340
I'm not even gonna entertain a second game.

12709
09:51:34,400 --> 09:51:35,160
I'm fucking tired.

12710
09:51:35,440 --> 09:51:37,680
I'm hitting my tired streak now.

12711
09:51:39,840 --> 09:51:40,280
Alright.

12712
09:51:41,460 --> 09:51:43,660
If we don't, I'm fucking getting my GN2 back.

12713
09:51:43,660 --> 09:51:45,360
Oh, it's this fucking mad.

12714
09:51:46,860 --> 09:51:48,280
You guys like this map?

12715
09:51:49,320 --> 09:51:50,240
What map are we?

12716
09:51:50,580 --> 09:51:50,900
No.

12717
09:51:51,160 --> 09:51:53,660
I think everybody hates this map.

12718
09:51:54,040 --> 09:51:55,580
Dude, it's so ass.

12719
09:51:55,660 --> 09:51:58,640
They actually learned nothing from Overwatch hybrid maps.

12720
09:51:58,980 --> 09:52:00,800
And they just made another one, but worse.

12721
09:52:03,240 --> 09:52:05,160
And the meat walls.

12722
09:52:06,180 --> 09:52:07,540
No, those are the worst.

12723
09:52:07,640 --> 09:52:08,600
The walls are the worst.

12724
09:52:08,700 --> 09:52:11,300
They actually can fuck your entire team over.

12725
09:52:12,120 --> 09:52:13,300
And they have a cooldown.

12726
09:52:15,360 --> 09:52:18,500
The battle starts in 5...

12727
09:52:18,500 --> 09:52:19,100
4...

12728
09:52:19,100 --> 09:52:19,980
3...

12729
09:52:19,980 --> 09:52:21,060
2...

12730
09:52:21,060 --> 09:52:22,220
1...

12731
09:52:22,220 --> 09:52:23,560
Alright, here we go.

12732
09:52:24,000 --> 09:52:26,680
Here we go.

12733
09:52:29,000 --> 09:52:29,920
Woah.

12734
09:52:31,280 --> 09:52:33,020
They got a bookie.

12735
09:52:33,660 --> 09:52:34,520
Here we go.

12736
09:52:39,060 --> 09:52:39,980
Woah.

12737
09:52:40,940 --> 09:52:41,340
I'm good.

12738
09:52:41,340 --> 09:52:42,180
Okay.

12739
09:52:42,760 --> 09:52:43,960
There's no one playing there.

12740
09:52:44,040 --> 09:52:46,900
Oh my god.

12741
09:52:48,000 --> 09:52:49,480
Oh my god, our poor Groot.

12742
09:52:53,980 --> 09:52:55,180
Oh my god.

12743
09:52:55,680 --> 09:52:56,680
He's so low though.

12744
09:52:56,960 --> 09:52:57,420
Wait, wait, wait.

12745
09:52:57,520 --> 09:52:59,260
If he can get strange, he's won.

12746
09:52:59,320 --> 09:52:59,980
He's actually won.

12747
09:53:01,180 --> 09:53:01,620
Nice.

12748
09:53:02,620 --> 09:53:03,260
Oh, I'm on.

12749
09:53:04,240 --> 09:53:05,120
I got you.

12750
09:53:07,260 --> 09:53:08,640
Okay, I don't got you.

12751
09:53:08,640 --> 09:53:09,460
Raccoon's low.

12752
09:53:12,060 --> 09:53:13,780
I swear to god, he's actually won.

12753
09:53:13,860 --> 09:53:15,360
You fucking make him extinct.

12754
09:53:15,880 --> 09:53:16,800
There we go.

12755
09:53:17,840 --> 09:53:18,280
Roadkill.

12756
09:53:18,920 --> 09:53:20,200
Get him out of here.

12757
09:53:20,260 --> 09:53:24,000
I'm gonna call the animal control on him.

12758
09:53:29,720 --> 09:53:30,660
I got you, man.

12759
09:53:30,700 --> 09:53:32,060
I damage boosted you.

12760
09:53:32,360 --> 09:53:33,460
You can chase him if you want.

12761
09:53:34,280 --> 09:53:35,600
Oh, that's the entire team.

12762
09:53:35,680 --> 09:53:36,420
Don't chase them.

12763
09:53:36,920 --> 09:53:37,560
Nah, I'm chasing.

12764
09:53:37,680 --> 09:53:37,980
I'm him.

12765
09:53:38,660 --> 09:53:40,400
No, the meat wall!

12766
09:53:40,800 --> 09:53:42,900
Fuck the meat wall.

12767
09:53:49,960 --> 09:53:51,120
I am...

12768
09:53:51,120 --> 09:53:52,180
I damage boosted you.

12769
09:53:53,500 --> 09:53:55,200
I slept the strange too.

12770
09:53:58,040 --> 09:53:58,920
He's dead.

12771
09:53:59,240 --> 09:54:01,200
Alright, I'm pushing cart with Raccoon.

12772
09:54:01,240 --> 09:54:02,580
Only one ult too.

12773
09:54:02,700 --> 09:54:03,300
That's so good.

12774
09:54:03,900 --> 09:54:05,500
Guys, I need to increase my accuracy.

12775
09:54:05,700 --> 09:54:06,260
It's 38.

12776
09:54:06,260 --> 09:54:07,860
Oh shit.

12777
09:54:08,500 --> 09:54:09,580
She's throwing.

12778
09:54:09,920 --> 09:54:12,260
I can't be throwing with 27% accuracy.

12779
09:54:15,950 --> 09:54:17,980
Close the meat wall.

12780
09:54:18,000 --> 09:54:19,540
Nah, that'd be fucked up.

12781
09:54:19,760 --> 09:54:21,120
Right here.

12782
09:54:23,320 --> 09:54:25,060
I killed the rocket.

12783
09:54:29,020 --> 09:54:30,560
Oh my god, I used...

12784
09:54:30,560 --> 09:54:31,540
Okay, I got rez.

12785
09:54:31,920 --> 09:54:32,240
Just live.

12786
09:54:32,240 --> 09:54:32,720
Just live.

12787
09:54:33,680 --> 09:54:34,420
This is winnable.

12788
09:54:35,100 --> 09:54:38,020
It's not winnable.

12789
09:54:38,140 --> 09:54:39,080
I don't think it's winnable.

12790
09:54:44,520 --> 09:54:48,560
Oh my god,

12791
09:54:52,370 --> 09:54:52,950
he's so low.

12792
09:54:53,150 --> 09:54:54,550
The strange is actually so low.

12793
09:54:55,170 --> 09:54:56,550
I can't boost with T.

12794
09:54:56,570 --> 09:54:57,250
He has no healers.

12795
09:54:58,910 --> 09:54:59,810
We can finish this.

12796
09:54:59,810 --> 09:55:01,490
We're getting a little silly with it.

12797
09:55:04,610 --> 09:55:06,770
I got the...

12798
09:55:06,770 --> 09:55:08,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12799
09:55:08,210 --> 09:55:09,010
It was so winnable.

12800
09:55:09,730 --> 09:55:10,770
Fuck you, yo.

12801
09:55:11,210 --> 09:55:12,990
Oh my god, I'm fucking insane.

12802
09:55:14,310 --> 09:55:16,170
My accuracy is at 33%.

12803
09:55:16,170 --> 09:55:16,890
I'm insane.

12804
09:55:18,950 --> 09:55:20,510
Okay, I...

12805
09:55:22,430 --> 09:55:24,310
And he has to know I was slouching.

12806
09:55:24,410 --> 09:55:26,950
I was lying back on my chair slouching playing Mantis.

12807
09:55:27,510 --> 09:55:28,650
I'm locked in now.

12808
09:55:28,750 --> 09:55:29,850
We're unlocked.

12809
09:55:29,850 --> 09:55:31,550
Feet up on the desk and everything.

12810
09:55:31,890 --> 09:55:33,390
Yeah, basically.

12811
09:55:34,310 --> 09:55:36,230
Eating ice cream with one hand.

12812
09:55:36,570 --> 09:55:37,910
Moving with the other hand.

12813
09:55:38,450 --> 09:55:39,930
Okay, now I'm sitting upright.

12814
09:55:43,490 --> 09:55:43,970
Okay.

12815
09:55:44,950 --> 09:55:45,710
This is good.

12816
09:55:47,350 --> 09:55:48,110
I'm gonna ult you.

12817
09:55:48,710 --> 09:55:50,750
Fuck, he's low.

12818
09:55:52,910 --> 09:55:53,390
Nice.

12819
09:55:53,790 --> 09:55:55,310
I hear footsteps somewhere.

12820
09:55:55,430 --> 09:55:56,230
Yeah, he's on the left.

12821
09:55:58,470 --> 09:55:59,250
I'm like...

12822
09:56:00,070 --> 09:56:00,810
He's one.

12823
09:56:01,050 --> 09:56:02,510
I don't know my left and right.

12824
09:56:04,330 --> 09:56:04,790
Oh my god.

12825
09:56:05,250 --> 09:56:06,270
I damage boost you too?

12826
09:56:07,410 --> 09:56:08,450
I'm gonna go back to the cart.

12827
09:56:15,710 --> 09:56:16,470
Here's damage boost.

12828
09:56:16,610 --> 09:56:17,130
If you need it.

12829
09:56:18,410 --> 09:56:18,950
I'm Groot.

12830
09:56:21,470 --> 09:56:22,730
Oh, I don't have anything for that.

12831
09:56:22,970 --> 09:56:23,370
I'm hiding.

12832
09:56:23,790 --> 09:56:24,650
Oh, nice.

12833
09:56:29,660 --> 09:56:30,480
That's huge.

12834
09:56:32,440 --> 09:56:33,520
That's so fun.

12835
09:56:33,520 --> 09:56:35,100
I only have one support.

12836
09:56:36,620 --> 09:56:37,020
No!

12837
09:56:38,760 --> 09:56:39,160
Goodbye!

12838
09:56:43,500 --> 09:56:44,100
Wait, it's winnable.

12839
09:56:44,940 --> 09:56:46,320
We have both...

12840
09:56:46,320 --> 09:56:47,180
Oh wait, we don't have supports.

12841
09:56:47,620 --> 09:56:48,720
But it's still winnable.

12842
09:56:49,940 --> 09:56:51,260
We have all supports.

12843
09:56:52,560 --> 09:56:52,960
Rocket.

12844
09:56:54,900 --> 09:56:55,640
I'm beating his ass.

12845
09:56:55,900 --> 09:56:57,360
I punched him out.

12846
09:56:58,020 --> 09:57:00,540
I don't know now if it's winnable, but I'm coming back with heals.

12847
09:57:02,240 --> 09:57:02,960
Get over here.

12848
09:57:04,820 --> 09:57:06,160
That's fucking right.

12849
09:57:06,300 --> 09:57:07,280
Go to sleep.

12850
09:57:08,180 --> 09:57:10,140
We're fucking him up.

12851
09:57:11,000 --> 09:57:12,200
Oh my god.

12852
09:57:12,780 --> 09:57:13,920
I'm shooting shit.

12853
09:57:14,220 --> 09:57:15,920
We're actually doing it.

12854
09:57:16,680 --> 09:57:23,840
I accidentally ended up in their spawn because I dashed through the side of the strange portal and I just was there.

12855
09:57:24,400 --> 09:57:25,620
Guys, it's not looking so good.

12856
09:57:25,720 --> 09:57:26,940
I have 32% accuracy.

12857
09:57:30,180 --> 09:57:31,140
Guys, please.

12858
09:57:31,300 --> 09:57:32,400
Not a good look for women.

12859
09:57:35,580 --> 09:57:37,200
Good luck to women?

12860
09:57:38,120 --> 09:57:40,220
Not a good look for women.

12861
09:57:42,600 --> 09:57:43,200
I'm sorry.

12862
09:57:43,260 --> 09:57:45,560
As the women representative, I'm so sorry.

12863
09:57:52,060 --> 09:57:54,620
Guys, for those who want context, we bumped it.

12864
09:57:54,620 --> 09:58:01,320
For those who are new here and didn't see one of our matches, for context, we bumped into this guy that was in the enemy team.

12865
09:58:01,680 --> 09:58:09,420
And he was flaming this other female player on his own team and talking about it in the match chat.

12866
09:58:09,760 --> 09:58:12,220
And he was like, 27% accuracy.

12867
09:58:12,460 --> 09:58:13,540
Yeah, that's a woman.

12868
09:58:14,180 --> 09:58:18,520
And then I was like, but I'm female too.

12869
09:58:18,640 --> 09:58:21,100
And I had 47% accuracy on Mantis.

12870
09:58:21,100 --> 09:58:24,120
Like, she had 27% and I had 47% on my team.

12871
09:58:24,520 --> 09:58:27,260
And he was like, yeah, but you're one of the only good ones.

12872
09:58:27,680 --> 09:58:29,140
You're one of the good ones.

12873
09:58:33,360 --> 09:58:35,460
I was just like, holy fuck.

12874
09:58:35,600 --> 09:58:35,980
Like, what?

12875
09:58:38,860 --> 09:58:40,580
It doesn't look like it.

12876
09:58:40,860 --> 09:58:42,560
Because I was like, the fuck you mean?

12877
09:58:42,760 --> 09:58:44,700
That's a female player.

12878
09:58:45,000 --> 09:58:46,440
He's like, that's a female player.

12879
09:58:47,720 --> 09:58:48,740
Bucky, I'm going to tag him.

12880
09:58:48,820 --> 09:58:49,440
He's walking to you.

12881
09:58:49,840 --> 09:58:50,880
I hit him a little bit.

12882
09:58:52,500 --> 09:58:53,980
I shot him a little bit for you.

12883
09:58:54,360 --> 09:58:55,360
I got you damage boost.

12884
09:58:55,520 --> 09:58:56,160
Oh, nice.

12885
09:58:57,040 --> 09:59:00,560
Bro, that poor fucking...

12886
09:59:00,560 --> 09:59:01,400
I'm going to break their ass.

12887
09:59:03,320 --> 09:59:04,200
I'll break their ass.

12888
09:59:11,100 --> 09:59:12,380
I'm trying to help you there.

12889
09:59:12,540 --> 09:59:13,020
I got you.

12890
09:59:13,220 --> 09:59:13,660
I got you.

12891
09:59:13,720 --> 09:59:14,080
I got you.

12892
09:59:15,300 --> 09:59:15,980
You're safe.

12893
09:59:17,180 --> 09:59:21,940
I've never played this fucking ahead this up in a while.

12894
09:59:21,960 --> 09:59:23,100
Do you see that Magneto?

12895
09:59:24,420 --> 09:59:24,880
Yeah.

12896
09:59:25,360 --> 09:59:26,760
This guy is not...

12897
09:59:26,760 --> 09:59:26,960
I gave up.

12898
09:59:27,260 --> 09:59:28,280
This guy gave up.

12899
09:59:28,360 --> 09:59:30,100
I'm fucking farming my accuracy on him.

12900
09:59:31,860 --> 09:59:32,660
Let's go.

12901
09:59:32,800 --> 09:59:33,860
We're going for 70%.

12902
09:59:33,860 --> 09:59:36,520
How did I actually drop down?

12903
09:59:37,220 --> 09:59:39,640
I hit like three headshots in a row.

12904
09:59:42,500 --> 09:59:44,400
That's actually so fucked.

12905
09:59:47,240 --> 09:59:48,880
I can't believe it.

12906
09:59:48,880 --> 09:59:50,300
What the fuck?

12907
09:59:50,860 --> 09:59:51,880
Look at this raccoon.

12908
09:59:52,960 --> 09:59:55,640
Bro, I don't think they're playing the game anymore.

12909
09:59:55,820 --> 09:59:57,100
Merry Christmas, bro.

12910
09:59:57,560 --> 09:59:58,200
Merry Christmas.

12911
09:59:59,000 --> 10:00:00,120
Look at the raccoon, bro.

12912
10:00:00,280 --> 10:00:01,300
How am I supposed to hit that?

12913
10:00:02,020 --> 10:00:03,360
I want my accuracy.

12914
10:00:03,360 --> 10:00:05,720
How am I supposed to hit that?

12915
10:00:07,740 --> 10:00:09,160
I want my accuracy.

12916
10:00:09,400 --> 10:00:10,320
Let me hit you.

12917
10:00:10,320 --> 10:00:12,320
Bro, let me...

12918
10:00:15,140 --> 10:00:16,780
Oh look, there's a Dr. Strange here.

12919
10:00:16,820 --> 10:00:18,460
I'll give you damage boost and...

12920
10:00:18,460 --> 10:00:19,000
Thank you.

12921
10:00:19,360 --> 10:00:20,540
Hold up, I have a plan.

12922
10:00:23,720 --> 10:00:25,540
No, the Pope!

12923
10:00:26,840 --> 10:00:27,720
There you go.

12924
10:00:30,040 --> 10:00:31,320
You think I killed the raccoon?

12925
10:00:33,460 --> 10:00:34,360
Bro, this is sad.

12926
10:00:34,520 --> 10:00:35,420
This is so sad.

12927
10:00:35,560 --> 10:00:38,400
I feel like we should avoid everybody on the enemy team.

12928
10:00:39,500 --> 10:00:40,400
This is actually...

12929
10:00:40,940 --> 10:00:43,480
I just want to know the context of what happened over there.

12930
10:00:43,560 --> 10:00:45,100
Yeah, what happened on the 19th?

12931
10:00:45,100 --> 10:00:47,340
I think it's Christmas and they know we deserve it.

12932
10:00:48,080 --> 10:00:49,360
They had 2-2-2.

12933
10:00:49,640 --> 10:00:50,940
What happened to them?

12934
10:00:56,800 --> 10:00:58,480
Bro, what's going on?

12935
10:00:58,960 --> 10:01:00,360
This is a Christmas miracle.

12936
10:01:03,940 --> 10:01:06,120
I think this guy wants the Agamotto.

12937
10:01:07,620 --> 10:01:08,500
There's no way.

12938
10:01:11,600 --> 10:01:12,740
There's no way.

12939
10:01:12,740 --> 10:01:14,580
Oh, I found a hole in the wall.

12940
10:01:15,960 --> 10:01:16,880
I'm Groot.

12941
10:01:17,700 --> 10:01:18,920
Oh, he's coming over.

12942
10:01:19,060 --> 10:01:20,240
He's definitely looking to I.

12943
10:01:21,800 --> 10:01:22,720
He's coming over.

12944
10:01:22,800 --> 10:01:24,100
He's going to I you right there.

12945
10:01:24,980 --> 10:01:25,380
Uh oh.

12946
10:01:26,040 --> 10:01:26,900
You're fine.

12947
10:01:28,520 --> 10:01:29,460
You're so healthy.

12948
10:01:29,800 --> 10:01:31,580
I don't want to die against that.

12949
10:01:32,080 --> 10:01:32,920
I'm 1v1-ing the Pope.

12950
10:01:33,680 --> 10:01:35,400
Oh my god, not the Pope.

12951
10:01:38,660 --> 10:01:39,940
The Pope has aimbot!

12952
10:01:40,600 --> 10:01:41,980
You're fine, I ulted.

12953
10:01:42,740 --> 10:01:46,120
If you lose to that, it dents on you.

12954
10:01:51,420 --> 10:01:54,480
I don't care, I'm stat-padding.

12955
10:01:55,100 --> 10:01:56,940
Sorry if you guys want to be friendly, but...

12956
10:01:57,920 --> 10:01:59,500
I'm stat-padding too, don't worry.

12957
10:02:00,120 --> 10:02:01,500
My accuracy keeps going lower.

12958
10:02:01,640 --> 10:02:02,380
I don't understand.

12959
10:02:02,820 --> 10:02:04,880
They're actually making my accuracy worse.

12960
10:02:05,080 --> 10:02:08,380
I'm going to lie and say that I didn't notice.

12961
10:02:09,060 --> 10:02:11,800
How are they making my accuracy worse?

12962
10:02:11,900 --> 10:02:13,580
I'm literally hitting my shots.

12963
10:02:17,080 --> 10:02:18,200
What happened?

12964
10:02:18,640 --> 10:02:23,180
He was just jumping at me innocently like he wanted to be friends.

12965
10:02:23,800 --> 10:02:26,060
What happened in the team chat?

12966
10:02:26,620 --> 10:02:27,940
I need to know.

12967
10:02:30,540 --> 10:02:31,800
He wants to show you something.

12968
10:02:35,420 --> 10:02:37,180
Who boomed and why?

12969
10:02:38,380 --> 10:02:39,740
You liked that.

12970
10:02:44,540 --> 10:02:45,980
Merry Christmas.

12971
10:02:54,400 --> 10:02:58,820
No one in the NA team is saying anything about what happened.

12972
10:02:59,420 --> 10:03:03,280
I don't know if I want any of those people on my team.

12973
10:03:03,700 --> 10:03:04,260
18?

12974
10:03:04,720 --> 10:03:05,160
Really?

12975
10:03:05,660 --> 10:03:06,580
I got 20!

12976
10:03:10,100 --> 10:03:11,340
Yo, I'm happy with 20.

12977
10:03:14,140 --> 10:03:14,580
Okay,

12978
10:03:18,420 --> 10:03:21,600
I can either leave right now or give Ruben another game.

12979
10:03:21,940 --> 10:03:22,700
One more game.

12980
10:03:22,880 --> 10:03:23,940
That wasn't a real game.

12981
10:03:29,340 --> 10:03:32,720
If I lose this, we're playing until I'm back to GM2.

12982
10:03:32,720 --> 10:03:33,280
There is no if.

12983
10:03:33,420 --> 10:03:34,620
We will win this one.

12984
10:03:34,640 --> 10:03:38,100
If we lose this, we're going until I'm back to GM2.

12985
10:03:38,100 --> 10:03:39,220
Okay, bet.

12986
10:03:40,120 --> 10:03:41,100
Say less.

12987
10:03:41,260 --> 10:03:42,160
I'm jumping off the map.

12988
10:03:42,300 --> 10:03:42,840
I'm picking Jeff.

12989
10:03:44,740 --> 10:03:46,000
We don't lose a game.

12990
10:03:46,320 --> 10:03:46,720
Not possible.

12991
10:03:49,960 --> 10:03:54,600
Somehow there's less GM players now than there were two hours ago.

12992
10:03:54,780 --> 10:03:55,320
Three hours ago.

12993
10:03:55,340 --> 10:03:55,980
It's Christmas!

12994
10:03:56,220 --> 10:03:57,140
What do you...

12995
10:03:57,140 --> 10:03:59,720
Okay, fucking and!

12996
10:04:00,380 --> 10:04:02,000
You're going to be grinding rifles!

12997
10:04:02,660 --> 10:04:04,240
Get that Christmas SR!

12998
10:04:05,120 --> 10:04:07,000
Bro, it's like that trauma shit.

12999
10:04:08,000 --> 10:04:09,000
Enthiruses SR.

13000
10:04:10,140 --> 10:04:19,180
Okay, the biggest reason is because on Christmas, a lot of the biggest streamers don't stream on Christmas playing Marvel Rivals.

13001
10:04:19,420 --> 10:04:22,100
Because they actually have things to do on Christmas.

13002
10:04:22,480 --> 10:04:29,120
So there's no stream snipers that are like, this is how I'm going to get on Shroud's team and become the next biggest streamer.

13003
10:04:30,880 --> 10:04:32,520
So we don't have that.

13004
10:04:32,800 --> 10:04:36,080
So now there's less GM players because they don't have a Shroud to stream snipe.

13005
10:04:37,000 --> 10:04:38,920
Oh, I get it now.

13006
10:04:39,760 --> 10:04:41,360
That's basically it.

13007
10:04:41,720 --> 10:04:44,180
See, I'm done celebrating Christmas.

13008
10:04:44,340 --> 10:04:46,660
So now all the Christmas SR is mine.

13009
10:04:47,540 --> 10:04:54,500
No, I think it's like people who actually want to grind the game that's on.

13010
10:04:55,980 --> 10:04:57,580
Or just, you know, they're depressed.

13011
10:04:58,520 --> 10:05:00,660
Okay, get to that.

13012
10:05:01,860 --> 10:05:02,700
What's the opposite?

13013
10:05:02,800 --> 10:05:04,280
Maybe they already celebrated.

13014
10:05:04,720 --> 10:05:06,320
I won't say it.

13015
10:05:06,460 --> 10:05:06,580
We'll never know.

13016
10:05:06,580 --> 10:05:08,400
Maybe they already celebrated Christmas.

13017
10:05:08,780 --> 10:05:10,920
Well, that's true, but they won't be on NA servers.

13018
10:05:11,180 --> 10:05:16,840
Because that's just, that's just like, wanting to lose.

13019
10:05:17,160 --> 10:05:20,060
This guy has CBP in his fucking banner.

13020
10:05:20,840 --> 10:05:21,880
Do we have a tank player?

13021
10:05:22,480 --> 10:05:22,960
Aww.

13022
10:05:24,000 --> 10:05:24,880
Uh oh.

13023
10:05:25,100 --> 10:05:26,580
Lord Hades, you're a tank player, right?

13024
10:05:26,580 --> 10:05:28,220
Lord Hades.

13025
10:05:28,480 --> 10:05:30,980
Lord Hades, 0-9-3-5.

13026
10:05:31,420 --> 10:05:32,800
He's about to hover Wolverine.

13027
10:05:35,580 --> 10:05:36,600
Okay, Hawkeye?

13028
10:05:37,140 --> 10:05:37,740
Yeah.

13029
10:05:38,700 --> 10:05:39,700
Stands for chicken bacon.

13030
10:05:39,920 --> 10:05:41,800
This guy's stream sniping!

13031
10:05:42,560 --> 10:05:44,040
Who's he stream sniping though?

13032
10:05:44,060 --> 10:05:44,760
There's so many.

13033
10:05:44,920 --> 10:05:46,240
One of us.

13034
10:05:47,720 --> 10:05:49,540
Who is he stream sniping?

13035
10:05:49,720 --> 10:05:52,460
He just repeated, he just answered my question.

13036
10:05:52,840 --> 10:05:53,820
Yo, what up Maddie?

13037
10:05:53,840 --> 10:05:54,520
How you doing?

13038
10:05:56,580 --> 10:05:57,400
Reuben on top.

13039
10:05:57,460 --> 10:05:57,820
Yo!

13040
10:05:59,620 --> 10:06:00,900
Oh my god.

13041
10:06:01,740 --> 10:06:05,180
Wait, did they know exactly what they're, what we're banning?

13042
10:06:05,660 --> 10:06:06,680
Nah, it's chill.

13043
10:06:07,520 --> 10:06:12,580
No, no, if they stream snipe our bans, then they are working with us.

13044
10:06:12,580 --> 10:06:13,560
Yeah, yeah, they're working with us.

13045
10:06:13,580 --> 10:06:14,980
Sorry, Lord's about to be gone.

13046
10:06:16,000 --> 10:06:16,840
Alright, we'll see.

13047
10:06:18,000 --> 10:06:18,420
Oh!

13048
10:06:18,700 --> 10:06:20,420
Oh my god, I get to play.

13049
10:06:20,500 --> 10:06:22,080
Wait, actual perfect bans.

13050
10:06:22,500 --> 10:06:24,020
Okay, but would Lord Hades play tank?

13051
10:06:25,980 --> 10:06:27,420
Would Lord Hades play tank?

13052
10:06:27,420 --> 10:06:28,520
I hope to god he does.

13053
10:06:28,800 --> 10:06:30,920
Would Lord Hades do the thing?

13054
10:06:33,080 --> 10:06:34,000
No, I didn't peep.

13055
10:06:34,180 --> 10:06:37,480
Listen, if you did peep, just so that you don't double ban, that's chill.

13056
10:06:37,880 --> 10:06:39,000
Oh shit, there he goes.

13057
10:06:39,460 --> 10:06:41,060
Wait, then he knows our comp exactly.

13058
10:06:41,580 --> 10:06:43,160
Nah, he's not peeping though.

13059
10:06:43,480 --> 10:06:45,740
Yo, I'm on Punisher right now guys.

13060
10:06:45,740 --> 10:06:50,220
I'm literally on the front page of, I'm literally on the front for Bible Rivals.

13061
10:06:51,480 --> 10:06:54,460
Guys, I'm on Punisher right now by the way.

13062
10:06:54,460 --> 10:06:57,600
I can't wait to punish your entire team with a shotgun.

13063
10:06:59,860 --> 10:07:01,940
Okay, you said don't peep in my eyes.

13064
10:07:02,080 --> 10:07:03,220
Ahem, fuck!

13065
10:07:04,740 --> 10:07:06,160
Maddy Figgs, no!

13066
10:07:07,440 --> 10:07:08,580
No, you know exactly.

13067
10:07:09,420 --> 10:07:10,800
This is why, well.

13068
10:07:11,760 --> 10:07:13,140
It's fine, we can just be better.

13069
10:07:13,280 --> 10:07:15,160
They know our comp, but we're just better players.

13070
10:07:15,160 --> 10:07:19,460
We pick the most random heroes and then swap, literally.

13071
10:07:20,480 --> 10:07:22,160
Nah, Maddy Figgs is chill.

13072
10:07:22,420 --> 10:07:23,320
Maddy Figgs would not leave our comp.

13073
10:07:23,320 --> 10:07:26,720
Yeah, but what if there's five other teammates?

13074
10:07:28,280 --> 10:07:29,920
Wait, oh yeah, they have Chime too.

13075
10:07:30,220 --> 10:07:30,460
Ah, fuck.

13076
10:07:31,580 --> 10:07:35,440
Chime is for sure stream sniping and counter swapping.

13077
10:07:38,800 --> 10:07:40,760
Watch, they're gonna have Namor, Loki.

13078
10:07:42,620 --> 10:07:44,620
I don't know what tank is good against Psylocke.

13079
10:07:44,620 --> 10:07:48,060
They have your stream open on the side so they know where you're invisible at.

13080
10:07:48,680 --> 10:07:49,180
Ah, fuck.

13081
10:07:49,380 --> 10:07:50,640
On the second monitor.

13082
10:07:50,760 --> 10:07:53,080
Oh, and now my frames are bad too, shit.

13083
10:07:53,340 --> 10:07:55,460
Okay, you didn't have to say that to us.

13084
10:07:55,600 --> 10:07:56,800
We didn't have to know.

13085
10:07:57,400 --> 10:07:58,400
They have Iron Man.

13086
10:07:58,500 --> 10:08:02,340
They have Iron Man?

13087
10:08:02,360 --> 10:08:03,400
Wait, did we not ban Hulk?

13088
10:08:03,780 --> 10:08:04,980
No, we didn't ban Hulk.

13089
10:08:05,680 --> 10:08:07,160
The strange ban went through instead.

13090
10:08:10,480 --> 10:08:12,640
Oh no, not the Hulk.

13091
10:08:15,990 --> 10:08:18,150
I literally can't get out of this choke because of the Hulk.

13092
10:08:19,850 --> 10:08:22,310
I'm almost back, just try not to die.

13093
10:08:24,670 --> 10:08:26,790
I can't get out of this choke.

13094
10:08:29,270 --> 10:08:29,950
Who banned Hulk?

13095
10:08:30,250 --> 10:08:31,170
Who banned Strange?

13096
10:08:31,270 --> 10:08:31,950
Who did it?

13097
10:08:33,010 --> 10:08:33,990
I killed their Mag.

13098
10:08:35,590 --> 10:08:36,770
Yeah, but I can't do anything.

13099
10:08:36,790 --> 10:08:38,290
I'm just insta-dead, bro.

13100
10:08:39,530 --> 10:08:42,250
Oh my god, who banned Strange over Hulk?

13101
10:08:42,270 --> 10:08:44,190
They have two tanks too.

13102
10:08:48,460 --> 10:08:49,460
That's unlucky.

13103
10:08:54,560 --> 10:08:55,920
Oh my god.

13104
10:08:57,880 --> 10:08:59,580
And they have Iron Man ult.

13105
10:09:01,320 --> 10:09:03,120
Oh my god, they have...

13106
10:09:04,260 --> 10:09:05,940
Iron Man's one, pushed him away.

13107
10:09:06,900 --> 10:09:09,400
Oh my god, crew, I can't see anything, dude.

13108
10:09:09,780 --> 10:09:10,180
It's all good.

13109
10:09:10,480 --> 10:09:10,880
Nice.

13110
10:09:11,540 --> 10:09:15,600
They have... they're gonna do a combo or something.

13111
10:09:16,920 --> 10:09:17,980
I damage boosted.

13112
10:09:18,080 --> 10:09:19,040
I can't heal you, Ruben.

13113
10:09:19,280 --> 10:09:19,880
I got you.

13114
10:09:24,680 --> 10:09:26,040
I don't know what that is.

13115
10:09:26,320 --> 10:09:26,840
Oh my god.

13116
10:09:26,840 --> 10:09:27,960
I jumped into it.

13117
10:09:28,900 --> 10:09:29,660
That's crazy.

13118
10:09:29,880 --> 10:09:31,560
I don't think we win this, though.

13119
10:09:35,300 --> 10:09:37,420
They used... I don't think we win this.

13120
10:09:37,480 --> 10:09:39,320
I just died without using my ult.

13121
10:09:43,440 --> 10:09:43,840
Ah.

13122
10:09:43,960 --> 10:09:46,280
I didn't go in with the Mantis ult.

13123
10:09:46,600 --> 10:09:50,820
They had... they had Psylocke ult, so I'm not gonna go in.

13124
10:09:56,170 --> 10:09:57,210
He's gonna... yeah.

13125
10:09:58,430 --> 10:09:59,230
Yeah, I...

13126
10:10:01,390 --> 10:10:05,430
I just woke him up because I feel like... there's no way.

13127
10:10:05,510 --> 10:10:06,070
No, I can touch.

13128
10:10:06,870 --> 10:10:09,090
Yeah, I can definitely touch, don't worry about it.

13129
10:10:10,750 --> 10:10:12,210
Or... do you wanna touch or do I touch?

13130
10:10:12,210 --> 10:10:13,310
I'll touch.

13131
10:10:13,570 --> 10:10:14,370
Okay, okay.

13132
10:10:14,370 --> 10:10:16,430
I'm not gonna use my... I don't know if we win this here.

13133
10:10:16,810 --> 10:10:17,790
Do we use ults for this?

13134
10:10:20,970 --> 10:10:21,830
This is winnable.

13135
10:10:22,210 --> 10:10:22,750
Hey, okay.

13136
10:10:27,210 --> 10:10:28,390
Okay, I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

13137
10:10:28,470 --> 10:10:29,070
You can peek me.

13138
10:10:29,710 --> 10:10:30,850
I'm ulting this in.

13139
10:10:31,930 --> 10:10:32,910
I'm damage boosting.

13140
10:10:35,850 --> 10:10:37,070
I got Psylocke.

13141
10:10:39,410 --> 10:10:41,130
We can try and chase the Hulk.

13142
10:10:41,290 --> 10:10:42,130
I'm damage boosting you.

13143
10:10:45,890 --> 10:10:47,210
Okay, he got away, he got away.

13144
10:10:48,850 --> 10:10:49,470
Oh, I'm dead.

13145
10:10:50,110 --> 10:10:50,670
It's fine.

13146
10:10:50,910 --> 10:10:52,450
Our bike bucky is okay too.

13147
10:10:53,950 --> 10:10:56,050
Jesus Christ, the fucking...

13148
10:10:56,530 --> 10:11:00,070
The only bad thing about it is that my... our heals don't outheal this.

13149
10:11:04,380 --> 10:11:05,820
I can't see you guys for heals.

13150
10:11:09,790 --> 10:11:10,730
I see you guys, I see you guys!

13151
10:11:10,730 --> 10:11:11,270
That's a huge ult!

13152
10:11:16,220 --> 10:11:16,620
Why?

13153
10:11:18,560 --> 10:11:19,560
Oh my god.

13154
10:11:20,420 --> 10:11:21,900
I'm just dead, man.

13155
10:11:21,940 --> 10:11:23,560
Iron Man is so bullshit.

13156
10:11:25,900 --> 10:11:26,980
Groot, Groot!

13157
10:11:28,900 --> 10:11:30,400
Yeah, she's won!

13158
10:11:30,620 --> 10:11:40,150
Oh my god, please!

13159
10:11:41,490 --> 10:11:42,450
Please, no!

13160
10:11:42,670 --> 10:11:43,930
I almost got my ult!

13161
10:11:44,530 --> 10:11:45,370
I had no...

13162
10:11:47,450 --> 10:11:50,990
The Mantis ult, that... we were definitely way too pushed up there.

13163
10:11:52,970 --> 10:11:55,730
I can't have Mantis ult for the next round.

13164
10:11:58,970 --> 10:11:59,690
Not a round.

13165
10:11:59,830 --> 10:12:01,290
That was just a really good Iron Man map.

13166
10:12:01,710 --> 10:12:02,010
Yeah.

13167
10:12:03,030 --> 10:12:06,130
Oh my god, I can't see the strange fucking picture.

13168
10:12:06,250 --> 10:12:08,110
Who was it?

13169
10:12:08,370 --> 10:12:09,310
Give me names!

13170
10:12:10,330 --> 10:12:10,970
I don't know.

13171
10:12:11,210 --> 10:12:12,750
I definitely think I voted for...

13172
10:12:12,750 --> 10:12:13,790
I'm gonna look at the vine.

13173
10:12:14,510 --> 10:12:15,710
Yeah, we're gonna flame that guy.

13174
10:12:16,310 --> 10:12:18,170
I'm not gonna flame him, but I'll remember him.

13175
10:12:18,510 --> 10:12:19,190
Nah, flame him.

13176
10:12:19,210 --> 10:12:21,450
He's on my personal int list, but like, I won't actually flame him.

13177
10:12:21,450 --> 10:12:23,110
Oh shit, she's got an int list.

13178
10:12:25,050 --> 10:12:28,190
I won't int, but like, he's there.

13179
10:12:29,090 --> 10:12:31,190
In my mind, I'll be inting.

13180
10:12:33,610 --> 10:12:35,570
I'll be inting his reputation.

13181
10:12:38,530 --> 10:12:40,030
I'm gonna remember you.

13182
10:12:42,270 --> 10:12:44,810
I got my list and I'm checking it twice, exactly.

13183
10:12:48,630 --> 10:12:50,730
Oh my god, it's 8am.

13184
10:12:51,190 --> 10:12:52,530
Holy fuck.

13185
10:12:53,910 --> 10:12:54,710
What you opening up?

13186
10:12:55,510 --> 10:12:56,330
A cough drop.

13187
10:12:56,530 --> 10:12:58,710
I've been talking for like 9 hours.

13188
10:12:59,110 --> 10:13:01,030
Or 10, honestly, I've lost track.

13189
10:13:01,170 --> 10:13:01,550
That's so irresponsible of you.

13190
10:13:02,190 --> 10:13:03,470
I've lost track of time.

13191
10:13:04,390 --> 10:13:05,790
Guys, how long have I been streaming for?

13192
10:13:09,610 --> 10:13:11,270
So many things happened today.

13193
10:13:12,230 --> 10:13:13,750
I'm damage booster you, Max?

13194
10:13:14,730 --> 10:13:16,450
I damage boosted our Bucky.

13195
10:13:17,390 --> 10:13:18,890
Alright, he's asleep now.

13196
10:13:19,670 --> 10:13:21,290
He just insta killed me.

13197
10:13:22,230 --> 10:13:24,110
Dude, I got slapped.

13198
10:13:27,470 --> 10:13:30,710
Oh my god, not the whole smash.

13199
10:13:30,990 --> 10:13:32,490
Oh, I got stomped.

13200
10:13:37,710 --> 10:13:41,670
Alright guys, we're gonna be gaming until I'm back to GM2.

13201
10:13:41,830 --> 10:13:43,250
No, no, no, we're not losing this game.

13202
10:13:44,170 --> 10:13:45,030
That's one.

13203
10:13:45,210 --> 10:13:48,910
I damage boosted you, but I don't know if it's gonna do anything.

13204
10:13:56,100 --> 10:13:58,740
Um, I'm on point.

13205
10:13:59,480 --> 10:14:00,940
There's nobody here.

13206
10:14:04,460 --> 10:14:09,650
Oh my god, he's solo.

13207
10:14:10,670 --> 10:14:11,550
He's actually solo.

13208
10:14:12,610 --> 10:14:13,070
I ulted.

13209
10:14:13,070 --> 10:14:13,450
Judge!

13210
10:14:16,070 --> 10:14:19,670
Jesus, what's going on?

13211
10:14:23,030 --> 10:14:25,530
There's so many things on my screen.

13212
10:14:26,650 --> 10:14:28,390
Oh my god.

13213
10:14:30,090 --> 10:14:33,430
There were so many things on my screen there.

13214
10:14:35,410 --> 10:14:38,570
I actually over sensitized there.

13215
10:14:39,310 --> 10:14:39,810
Over there?

13216
10:14:39,850 --> 10:14:40,550
There, yeah.

13217
10:14:44,920 --> 10:14:46,420
I'm flanking so I can catch one.

13218
10:14:49,320 --> 10:14:51,040
You have to rely on...

13219
10:14:51,660 --> 10:14:52,100
Okay.

13220
10:14:56,240 --> 10:14:56,680
Whoa!

13221
10:14:56,860 --> 10:14:58,140
Oh, I used my sleep accidentally.

13222
10:14:59,140 --> 10:15:02,520
I thought that was the last guy and I just triple stacked up there.

13223
10:15:08,530 --> 10:15:10,130
There's people in the corner.

13224
10:15:11,110 --> 10:15:12,450
I'm gonna damage boost you, Ruben.

13225
10:15:12,910 --> 10:15:13,350
Okay.

13226
10:15:14,770 --> 10:15:17,110
They're in this corner and I'll damage boost you too, Max.

13227
10:15:17,890 --> 10:15:18,730
Oh, shotgun, care.

13228
10:15:19,590 --> 10:15:21,070
Okay, I got your heals.

13229
10:15:26,540 --> 10:15:27,740
There's a Psylocke on me.

13230
10:15:27,940 --> 10:15:29,560
Oh, fucking Iron Man!

13231
10:15:30,780 --> 10:15:31,740
Holy shit.

13232
10:15:32,160 --> 10:15:33,840
I got Psylocke, I got Psylocke.

13233
10:15:34,780 --> 10:15:35,260
Nice.

13234
10:15:37,920 --> 10:15:39,220
Damage boosting you, Max.

13235
10:15:40,120 --> 10:15:42,040
And then you get the regen too.

13236
10:15:42,480 --> 10:15:43,480
And I'll damage boost you too.

13237
10:15:45,580 --> 10:15:46,880
You both have damage boost.

13238
10:15:47,920 --> 10:15:48,400
Wicked.

13239
10:15:48,900 --> 10:15:50,100
I'll give you another damage boost too.

13240
10:15:51,920 --> 10:15:52,320
My luck.

13241
10:15:55,320 --> 10:15:56,140
Oh no.

13242
10:15:56,920 --> 10:15:57,920
You're by yourself.

13243
10:15:58,760 --> 10:15:59,460
I'm trying to get up.

13244
10:16:01,360 --> 10:16:02,260
Oh, fuck.

13245
10:16:02,760 --> 10:16:03,200
Got you.

13246
10:16:06,660 --> 10:16:07,740
Oh, he's so low.

13247
10:16:07,740 --> 10:16:08,020
I killed Iron Man.

13248
10:16:10,760 --> 10:16:11,640
Hulk didn't get many.

13249
10:16:11,720 --> 10:16:12,020
Nice!

13250
10:16:16,820 --> 10:16:18,540
No, no, I fell asleep!

13251
10:16:18,760 --> 10:16:19,060
Ah!

13252
10:16:21,500 --> 10:16:23,740
Wait, I have Mantis Law for retake.

13253
10:16:23,740 --> 10:16:24,480
No.

13254
10:16:24,900 --> 10:16:25,760
And we can all regroup.

13255
10:16:31,780 --> 10:16:32,260
Alright.

13256
10:16:33,440 --> 10:16:33,920
Ow.

13257
10:16:36,180 --> 10:16:37,880
What the fuck did Breakout was doing?

13258
10:16:41,770 --> 10:16:42,850
What the fuck?

13259
10:16:43,550 --> 10:16:44,070
I'm fine.

13260
10:16:44,310 --> 10:16:44,850
I gave you damage boost.

13261
10:16:44,850 --> 10:16:45,630
I almost got all.

13262
10:16:46,450 --> 10:16:47,170
I have all too.

13263
10:16:47,210 --> 10:16:48,250
I just got stunned.

13264
10:16:49,950 --> 10:16:51,370
You got damage boosted.

13265
10:16:52,570 --> 10:16:53,670
Oh no, our Tendi!

13266
10:16:53,670 --> 10:16:56,150
That's not good, that guy just ate Iron Man missiles.

13267
10:16:57,330 --> 10:16:57,930
That poor guy.

13268
10:16:58,010 --> 10:16:58,990
I'm gonna try to look for a flank.

13269
10:17:01,330 --> 10:17:02,070
Wait, we got one.

13270
10:17:04,370 --> 10:17:05,990
Wait, that's huge, that's huge, that's a huge fight.

13271
10:17:07,090 --> 10:17:07,570
Where are you?

13272
10:17:07,750 --> 10:17:08,590
I got you, I got you.

13273
10:17:12,210 --> 10:17:13,930
I'm on the point and he's asleep.

13274
10:17:14,770 --> 10:17:15,610
He was asleep.

13275
10:17:15,910 --> 10:17:17,670
He got everything possible.

13276
10:17:18,870 --> 10:17:19,410
There we go.

13277
10:17:20,830 --> 10:17:22,490
I'm keeping my Mantis Law, I'm keeping it.

13278
10:17:22,990 --> 10:17:24,550
I'm zoning Psylocke.

13279
10:17:24,590 --> 10:17:25,430
I'm coming with you, I'm coming with you.

13280
10:17:27,070 --> 10:17:28,490
I'm damage boosting you for it.

13281
10:17:30,290 --> 10:17:31,190
Iron Man slow.

13282
10:17:32,310 --> 10:17:32,890
Huge, huge, huge.

13283
10:17:32,950 --> 10:17:34,170
Yeah, okay.

13284
10:17:34,930 --> 10:17:35,330
I'm on the ball.

13285
10:17:36,330 --> 10:17:37,230
Oh my god.

13286
10:17:39,030 --> 10:17:39,510
Okay.

13287
10:17:41,890 --> 10:17:42,370
Okay.

13288
10:17:42,970 --> 10:17:44,910
I'm like forehead to monitor for this game.

13289
10:17:45,370 --> 10:17:46,570
Me too, I'm like sitting upright.

13290
10:17:47,270 --> 10:17:49,310
I'm so fucking locked in right now.

13291
10:17:49,310 --> 10:17:49,470
Oh.

13292
10:17:53,590 --> 10:17:54,070
Boop.

13293
10:17:54,850 --> 10:17:55,070
Boop.

13294
10:17:55,110 --> 10:17:58,950
I'm so glad that anytime I did die to the Iron Man that round, he died immediately after.

13295
10:17:59,110 --> 10:17:59,750
That was so nice.

13296
10:18:00,190 --> 10:18:01,030
Oh my god.

13297
10:18:03,710 --> 10:18:04,530
It's fine.

13298
10:18:04,950 --> 10:18:06,590
We're so, we're so okay.

13299
10:18:12,350 --> 10:18:13,450
We're so okay.

13300
10:18:13,450 --> 10:18:14,830
We're so okay.

13301
10:18:16,770 --> 10:18:19,070
Guys, remember when I was a humble Luna one trick?

13302
10:18:19,230 --> 10:18:21,290
Look how much I evolved since hitting Diamond.

13303
10:18:24,470 --> 10:18:25,330
Look at me.

13304
10:18:32,790 --> 10:18:34,330
Thank you so much.

13305
10:18:34,490 --> 10:18:35,050
What's up there?

13306
10:18:35,550 --> 10:18:37,550
Oh, and this is a really bad Iron Man map.

13307
10:18:38,310 --> 10:18:39,750
Isn't this a good Iron Man map?

13308
10:18:39,930 --> 10:18:41,310
This is not a bad Iron Man map.

13309
10:18:41,710 --> 10:18:44,190
I feel like it's a pretty terrible Iron Man map.

13310
10:18:44,270 --> 10:18:45,930
No, this is a very good Iron Man map.

13311
10:18:45,950 --> 10:18:47,730
Look, if he wins this round, it's a terrible Iron Man map.

13312
10:18:50,010 --> 10:18:50,410
Okay.

13313
10:18:53,270 --> 10:18:54,230
Oh my god.

13314
10:18:54,290 --> 10:18:54,850
I don't use this.

13315
10:18:55,890 --> 10:18:57,470
We fucking go up for this.

13316
10:18:58,610 --> 10:18:59,350
Solox one.

13317
10:18:59,850 --> 10:19:00,950
Here, I give you damage boost.

13318
10:19:03,490 --> 10:19:04,710
Can you give me damage boost too?

13319
10:19:05,670 --> 10:19:07,570
We got the point, we got the cap at least.

13320
10:19:08,250 --> 10:19:09,050
I'm at low.

13321
10:19:09,870 --> 10:19:10,610
Here you go.

13322
10:19:12,650 --> 10:19:14,050
I give you damage boost, Mac.

13323
10:19:14,270 --> 10:19:15,130
Solox on the right.

13324
10:19:16,150 --> 10:19:17,730
And I give damage boost to you too.

13325
10:19:18,430 --> 10:19:19,030
Oh, behind you Reuben.

13326
10:19:19,250 --> 10:19:19,550
Fuck.

13327
10:19:22,090 --> 10:19:23,430
There's a Magneto that's asleep.

13328
10:19:27,630 --> 10:19:29,150
They're gonna come in for him.

13329
10:19:30,450 --> 10:19:31,450
Oh my god.

13330
10:19:34,850 --> 10:19:36,350
I can't see shit.

13331
10:19:37,850 --> 10:19:39,070
I'm trying to get you.

13332
10:19:39,210 --> 10:19:39,970
Oh no!

13333
10:19:43,450 --> 10:19:45,110
We gotta just die on point, I think.

13334
10:19:45,530 --> 10:19:45,890
Yeah.

13335
10:19:48,570 --> 10:19:49,310
This is cool.

13336
10:19:49,890 --> 10:19:50,350
That's fine.

13337
10:19:50,390 --> 10:19:51,370
They have no support ults.

13338
10:19:51,590 --> 10:19:53,230
They have no support ults, no Solox ult.

13339
10:19:54,310 --> 10:19:56,010
They're gonna have Mag and Iron Man.

13340
10:19:57,670 --> 10:19:58,990
We have low heal too.

13341
10:20:02,550 --> 10:20:02,950
Okay.

13342
10:20:04,450 --> 10:20:05,610
I'm giving you damage boost.

13343
10:20:06,410 --> 10:20:07,650
Yeah, I'm gonna look for an ult here.

13344
10:20:07,650 --> 10:20:09,150
And I'll give you damage boost too, Reuben.

13345
10:20:09,810 --> 10:20:10,730
Okay, we're good.

13346
10:20:12,250 --> 10:20:13,010
Alright, goodbye.

13347
10:20:13,990 --> 10:20:14,590
I'm ulting.

13348
10:20:15,410 --> 10:20:16,490
Are you serious?

13349
10:20:16,610 --> 10:20:17,210
That hits me?

13350
10:20:17,210 --> 10:20:18,430
Nah, I still think this is winnable.

13351
10:20:18,950 --> 10:20:19,610
No, it's not.

13352
10:20:19,710 --> 10:20:19,910
Yeah.

13353
10:20:21,730 --> 10:20:22,090
Unless...

13354
10:20:22,090 --> 10:20:23,470
It's winnable, it's winnable, it's winnable.

13355
10:20:23,710 --> 10:20:24,570
I killed three, I killed three.

13356
10:20:24,850 --> 10:20:25,090
Yeah.

13357
10:20:27,170 --> 10:20:28,410
We have low key, we have low key.

13358
10:20:30,370 --> 10:20:31,450
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

13359
10:20:32,110 --> 10:20:32,650
Good shit.

13360
10:20:35,270 --> 10:20:36,350
I'm coming back to you.

13361
10:20:39,150 --> 10:20:41,390
Bro, I've never felt so much rage at that.

13362
10:20:41,490 --> 10:20:42,730
That was so bullshit.

13363
10:20:43,310 --> 10:20:44,230
I gave you both damage boost.

13364
10:20:45,110 --> 10:20:45,910
Thank you.

13365
10:20:49,850 --> 10:20:51,390
This Iron Man...

13366
10:20:51,390 --> 10:20:52,050
Wait, no.

13367
10:20:52,230 --> 10:20:52,890
No, he didn't use ult.

13368
10:20:52,890 --> 10:20:53,770
Iron Man's low on the right.

13369
10:20:54,030 --> 10:20:55,290
He did use ult, he did use ult.

13370
10:20:55,530 --> 10:20:55,890
Okay, okay.

13371
10:20:56,890 --> 10:20:57,790
I got Ike's ult.

13372
10:20:58,450 --> 10:20:59,010
It's fine.

13373
10:21:01,350 --> 10:21:02,390
Nice, that's a pick.

13374
10:21:05,270 --> 10:21:05,990
Iron Man half.

13375
10:21:06,390 --> 10:21:06,710
Nice.

13376
10:21:07,350 --> 10:21:08,250
I damage boosted you, Reuben.

13377
10:21:09,150 --> 10:21:09,370
Big.

13378
10:21:12,750 --> 10:21:13,190
Okay.

13379
10:21:14,230 --> 10:21:15,110
I'm looking for you.

13380
10:21:16,250 --> 10:21:16,710
I'm damage boosting.

13381
10:21:17,050 --> 10:21:17,910
I'm damage boosting you.

13382
10:21:18,190 --> 10:21:18,590
Huge.

13383
10:21:18,810 --> 10:21:19,550
I healed you too.

13384
10:21:19,910 --> 10:21:20,810
Psylocke, Psylocke ult.

13385
10:21:21,070 --> 10:21:21,310
Nice.

13386
10:21:23,470 --> 10:21:25,510
Oh my god, I hear so many.

13387
10:21:25,710 --> 10:21:26,030
I'm backing up.

13388
10:21:27,290 --> 10:21:29,330
Oh my god, Punisher, you're not them.

13389
10:21:29,410 --> 10:21:29,930
You're not him.

13390
10:21:31,270 --> 10:21:32,410
You know who is him?

13391
10:21:32,590 --> 10:21:32,990
Me.

13392
10:21:33,350 --> 10:21:34,690
I got my Psylocke ult again.

13393
10:21:35,270 --> 10:21:35,730
I damage boost.

13394
10:21:36,210 --> 10:21:37,430
Hulk to the right, Hulk to the right.

13395
10:21:37,510 --> 10:21:38,030
He's jumping in.

13396
10:21:38,630 --> 10:21:39,550
Yeah, I'm on him.

13397
10:21:40,470 --> 10:21:41,150
Hulk ulted.

13398
10:21:41,870 --> 10:21:42,070
Oh no.

13399
10:21:42,070 --> 10:21:42,650
I can ult this.

13400
10:21:43,090 --> 10:21:43,570
Oh no.

13401
10:21:44,210 --> 10:21:44,830
It's fine.

13402
10:21:45,550 --> 10:21:46,210
Just make a mini.

13403
10:21:46,290 --> 10:21:46,650
Make a mini.

13404
10:21:47,670 --> 10:21:48,370
Oh no.

13405
10:21:48,630 --> 10:21:49,590
Okay, that's fine.

13406
10:21:49,830 --> 10:21:50,350
I'm gonna hide.

13407
10:21:50,630 --> 10:21:50,650
I'm gonna hide.

13408
10:21:50,670 --> 10:21:51,250
I'm gonna hide.

13409
10:21:51,370 --> 10:21:51,890
I can go crazy.

13410
10:21:52,130 --> 10:21:52,470
Yeah.

13411
10:21:56,270 --> 10:21:57,510
That's fine to use Psylocke too.

13412
10:21:57,590 --> 10:21:58,190
I come back with Psy.

13413
10:21:58,290 --> 10:21:58,510
Nice, nice, nice.

13414
10:21:58,830 --> 10:21:59,350
Don't use anything.

13415
10:21:59,470 --> 10:21:59,910
Don't use anything.

13416
10:22:01,070 --> 10:22:01,730
No ults.

13417
10:22:04,330 --> 10:22:05,410
Oh wait, wait, we can fight.

13418
10:22:05,510 --> 10:22:05,970
We can win this.

13419
10:22:06,030 --> 10:22:06,590
We can win this.

13420
10:22:06,590 --> 10:22:07,490
I killed two.

13421
10:22:07,610 --> 10:22:08,310
I killed both supports.

13422
10:22:08,810 --> 10:22:09,910
Psylocke, Psylocke, Psylocke.

13423
10:22:10,230 --> 10:22:11,290
I'm coming back.

13424
10:22:12,550 --> 10:22:13,190
Nice.

13425
10:22:15,890 --> 10:22:17,370
Oh my god.

13426
10:22:18,450 --> 10:22:19,550
It's that easy.

13427
10:22:20,050 --> 10:22:21,350
We clutched the fuck up.

13428
10:22:21,530 --> 10:22:22,930
We actually win this.

13429
10:22:24,130 --> 10:22:25,030
Oh my god.

13430
10:22:25,050 --> 10:22:26,010
Oh my god.

13431
10:22:26,090 --> 10:22:27,110
We fucking...

13432
10:22:27,110 --> 10:22:29,510
Everything was riding on that game.

13433
10:22:29,610 --> 10:22:32,830
If we lost, we would be stuck queuing for another four hours.

13434
10:22:34,370 --> 10:22:37,210
We all fucking clutched it up there.

13435
10:22:37,450 --> 10:22:38,750
Holy shit.

13436
10:22:40,370 --> 10:22:41,410
That was...

13437
10:22:41,410 --> 10:22:43,150
So much stress has been relieved.

13438
10:22:43,250 --> 10:22:44,590
Taking off my shoulders.

13439
10:22:44,910 --> 10:22:45,430
Oh my god.

13440
10:22:45,870 --> 10:22:46,750
You're ranked up.

13441
10:22:46,750 --> 10:22:47,230
Plus 19.

13442
10:22:47,610 --> 10:22:48,510
Don't even give a fuck.

13443
10:22:48,530 --> 10:22:48,750
Plus 18.

13444
10:22:48,930 --> 10:22:49,470
I'm fine.

13445
10:22:49,610 --> 10:22:50,090
I'm done.

13446
10:22:50,990 --> 10:22:51,650
GG's guys.

13447
10:22:52,250 --> 10:22:52,770
GG's.

13448
10:22:52,910 --> 10:22:53,630
I'm up.

13449
10:22:53,750 --> 10:22:54,970
I'm up two games.

13450
10:22:55,110 --> 10:22:56,350
That's all that matters for me.

13451
10:22:56,550 --> 10:22:56,590
I'm up.

13452
10:22:56,910 --> 10:22:58,410
I think I'm back where I started.

13453
10:22:59,970 --> 10:23:01,490
I'm up four games.

13454
10:23:01,650 --> 10:23:02,090
I'm happy.

13455
10:23:02,090 --> 10:23:02,730
I'm up two games.

13456
10:23:02,850 --> 10:23:03,750
I'm happy too.

13457
10:23:03,850 --> 10:23:04,830
I'm so happy.

13458
10:23:05,050 --> 10:23:06,430
I'm fine with that.

13459
10:23:06,490 --> 10:23:08,490
I'm just gonna go to bed, guys.

13460
10:23:09,190 --> 10:23:09,750
GG's.

13461
10:23:09,950 --> 10:23:11,630
We'll do this again tomorrow, I guess.

13462
10:23:11,930 --> 10:23:12,330
Yeah.

13463
10:23:13,890 --> 10:23:17,790
Guys, I'm just thinking if we grinded normal hours, do you think we'd actually climb?

13464
10:23:18,770 --> 10:23:19,730
Probably not.

13465
10:23:21,070 --> 10:23:23,450
Well, I climbed.

13466
10:23:26,170 --> 10:23:30,350
These matches have been some of the hardest matches I've ever played.

13467
10:23:31,090 --> 10:23:33,310
These are the matches I actually calmed.

13468
10:23:35,670 --> 10:23:37,970
I've never calmed this much before.

13469
10:23:39,110 --> 10:23:44,150
I'm honestly just impressed at how many games we played.

13470
10:23:45,070 --> 10:23:49,850
Coming from Overwatch, three games an hour tops.

13471
10:23:51,010 --> 10:23:52,050
We played so much.

13472
10:23:52,470 --> 10:23:52,830
We played a lot.

13473
10:23:52,830 --> 10:23:53,990
We played so many games.

13474
10:23:54,310 --> 10:23:55,070
This is awesome.

13475
10:23:55,270 --> 10:23:58,910
I love when I'm playing a game and I get to play the game.

13476
10:23:58,910 --> 10:24:00,350
It's fucking insane.

13477
10:24:00,830 --> 10:24:01,230
Yeah.

13478
10:24:01,310 --> 10:24:02,550
It's just very addicting.

13479
10:24:03,110 --> 10:24:06,050
Are you guys still going to play more Marvel Rivals?

13480
10:24:06,230 --> 10:24:06,810
Are you guys done?

13481
10:24:07,190 --> 10:24:10,030
I need to level up my second alt account.

13482
10:24:10,110 --> 10:24:11,150
Oh, you're fucking weak.

13483
10:24:11,270 --> 10:24:12,170
You're not gonna play on your main.

13484
10:24:12,350 --> 10:24:12,790
You're fucking...

13485
10:24:12,790 --> 10:24:17,710
Mac, if you keep playing on your main right now, I'll raid you.

13486
10:24:18,830 --> 10:24:22,530
If I keep playing on my main right now, I ain't okay.

13487
10:24:22,530 --> 10:24:24,870
Ruben, I was gonna offer it to you, but...

13488
10:24:24,870 --> 10:24:25,730
Shit, you know what?

13489
10:24:25,790 --> 10:24:27,890
Okay, I guess I'll keep queuing on the main.

13490
10:24:29,390 --> 10:24:30,830
I'm ready to go on your main!

13491
10:24:31,670 --> 10:24:32,830
That's a good deal!

13492
10:24:35,250 --> 10:24:36,470
Bro, Ruben, I'm sorry.

13493
10:24:36,970 --> 10:24:38,930
You missed the opportunity.

13494
10:24:40,130 --> 10:24:40,170
Fuck!

13495
10:24:40,730 --> 10:24:42,830
You missed the shots you don't take.

13496
10:24:43,250 --> 10:24:43,610
GG.

13497
10:24:44,050 --> 10:24:45,050
It's fucking over.

13498
10:24:45,750 --> 10:24:47,610
Wait, Mac, are you actually still gonna keep going?

13499
10:24:47,810 --> 10:24:47,870
I'll take it.

13500
10:24:47,870 --> 10:24:48,390
You're gonna keep going?

13501
10:24:48,390 --> 10:24:49,190
Yeah, I'll take it.

13502
10:24:49,630 --> 10:24:50,630
You're gonna fucking doom queue.

13503
10:24:51,070 --> 10:24:51,210
Let's go!

13504
10:24:51,490 --> 10:24:52,150
You're gonna wait.

13505
10:24:52,310 --> 10:24:54,370
You're gonna doom queue this shit.

13506
10:24:54,550 --> 10:24:55,790
Okay, GG, guys.

13507
10:24:55,790 --> 10:24:58,150
You're gonna be the next Designful stream.

13508
10:24:58,670 --> 10:24:59,810
Yep, you already know.

13509
10:25:00,090 --> 10:25:01,930
Alright, GGs, I'm gonna talk to my chat before I go.

13510
10:25:02,330 --> 10:25:02,690
Alright, GGs.

13511
10:25:02,730 --> 10:25:03,430
Bye-bye!

13512
10:25:03,630 --> 10:25:04,110
GGs.

13513
10:25:04,110 --> 10:25:04,890
Bye-bye!

13514
10:25:05,950 --> 10:25:07,130
That was fun!

13515
10:25:07,270 --> 10:25:11,450
I had a lot of fun playing with Ruben and Mac today.

13516
10:25:12,610 --> 10:25:15,950
We broke even and are up two games.

13517
10:25:16,030 --> 10:25:17,010
That's all that matters.

13518
10:25:17,550 --> 10:25:20,030
We actually ended on such a nice game, too.

13519
10:25:20,150 --> 10:25:22,950
That shit, all of us just locked in.

13520
10:25:23,550 --> 10:25:24,590
I'm up two games.

13521
10:25:24,590 --> 10:25:26,130
I'm fine being GM2 for today.

13522
10:25:26,330 --> 10:25:28,230
We'll get to GM1 another time.

13523
10:25:28,310 --> 10:25:29,250
I had a lot of fun playing.

13524
10:25:29,390 --> 10:25:30,030
I was up.

13525
10:25:30,170 --> 10:25:31,650
I streamed for 10 hours.

13526
10:25:32,070 --> 10:25:33,570
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

13527
10:25:33,630 --> 10:25:34,090
I'm so...

13528
10:25:34,090 --> 10:25:35,190
I love Marvel Rivals.

13529
10:25:35,330 --> 10:25:35,970
I'm so addicted.

13530
10:25:36,290 --> 10:25:37,290
I'm so sorry.

13531
10:25:38,490 --> 10:25:41,570
Kobato, thank you for the 10,000 bitties!

13532
10:25:41,790 --> 10:25:42,950
Thank you, thank you!

13533
10:25:43,170 --> 10:25:44,190
I really appreciate...

13534
10:25:44,190 --> 10:25:45,750
Alright, if you've seen some of the games...

13535
10:25:45,750 --> 10:25:46,270
I'm fucking...

13536
10:25:46,270 --> 10:25:53,910
If you've watched the entire 10-hour VOD and some of the games I fucking went through, like, there were some fucking ELO terrorists in my lobbies.

13537
10:25:54,030 --> 10:25:54,250
Like...

13538
10:25:54,250 --> 10:26:00,110
I would play out of my goddamn mind and I got the most ELO terrorists there.

13539
10:26:00,210 --> 10:26:01,290
It didn't matter.

13540
10:26:01,470 --> 10:26:02,870
I got fucking Neil.

13541
10:26:05,350 --> 10:26:07,430
Anyway, for those who are new here, my name is DokiBird.

13542
10:26:07,870 --> 10:26:10,170
I usually stream on YouTube, so please check me out there.

13543
10:26:10,270 --> 10:26:13,630
But I'm going to be doing a lot of my Marvel Rivals rank grind on Twitch.

13544
10:26:14,230 --> 10:26:18,810
And please follow me on Twitter if you want to keep up to date.

13545
10:26:19,090 --> 10:26:20,070
Exclamation point, Twitter.

13546
10:26:20,930 --> 10:26:24,010
I mean, everything is just DokiBird, so it's not really that difficult.

13547
10:26:24,010 --> 10:26:26,830
If you want to support me via other means, I have merch!

13548
10:26:27,070 --> 10:26:27,730
Exclamation point, merch.

13549
10:26:27,930 --> 10:26:29,430
I also have an Android!

13550
10:26:29,970 --> 10:26:30,910
Yes, that's me!

13551
10:26:31,030 --> 10:26:31,790
I actually have...

13552
10:26:31,790 --> 10:26:31,970
Yes!

13553
10:26:32,150 --> 10:26:33,610
I'm a pretty big deal.

13554
10:26:33,790 --> 10:26:34,590
Hee hee hee.

13555
10:26:34,790 --> 10:26:37,350
I have an Android there.

13556
10:26:37,610 --> 10:26:38,230
So, yeah.

13557
10:26:38,570 --> 10:26:39,770
My merch and stuff.

13558
10:26:40,090 --> 10:26:41,350
It really helps a lot.

13559
10:26:41,990 --> 10:26:43,310
And whatever stuff...

13560
10:26:43,310 --> 10:26:44,650
I have a Gamersubs code.

13561
10:26:44,770 --> 10:26:49,290
When you use my code, you get 10% off.

13562
10:26:49,830 --> 10:26:52,010
And I have my own custom PC case.

13563
10:26:52,050 --> 10:26:53,270
So you do exclamation point.

13564
10:26:53,270 --> 10:26:57,330
I also have a custom PC case and custom keycaps.

13565
10:26:57,550 --> 10:27:00,290
Yes, thank you so much for all the follows, for all the bitties, for all the subs.

13566
10:27:00,730 --> 10:27:04,430
For milking Valorant's wallet.

13567
10:27:04,750 --> 10:27:06,930
Because they have too much money anyway.

13568
10:27:09,810 --> 10:27:11,130
I really appreciate it.

13569
10:27:11,330 --> 10:27:13,850
Please subscribe to me on YouTube if you like more of my content.

13570
10:27:13,950 --> 10:27:15,450
I'll be doing a Christmas stream later today.

13571
10:27:15,770 --> 10:27:19,290
I went to sleep and then fucking set up my Christmas stream stuff.

13572
10:27:19,730 --> 10:27:20,110
And then...

13573
10:27:20,110 --> 10:27:22,290
Wait, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

13574
10:27:22,290 --> 10:27:23,530
Okay, I can sleep 7 hours.

13575
10:27:23,690 --> 10:27:24,370
And then I'll have time.

13576
10:27:24,530 --> 10:27:25,770
I have 2 hours to set things up.

13577
10:27:25,970 --> 10:27:28,750
And then maybe after the Christmas stream, I'll play more Marble Rivals.

13578
10:27:28,870 --> 10:27:29,210
Who knows?

13579
10:27:29,850 --> 10:27:30,810
Anyway, thank you guys.

13580
10:27:31,030 --> 10:27:32,010
Thank you all for coming.

13581
10:27:32,390 --> 10:27:33,630
As always, stay hydrated.

13582
10:27:33,770 --> 10:27:34,250
Posture check.

13583
10:27:34,310 --> 10:27:35,710
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

13584
10:27:35,810 --> 10:27:37,450
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

13585
10:27:37,570 --> 10:27:38,810
Because you deserve it.

13586
10:27:38,910 --> 10:27:40,070
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

13587
10:27:40,270 --> 10:27:40,930
Bye, guys.

13588
10:27:41,310 --> 10:27:41,630
Bye.

13589
10:27:42,010 --> 10:27:42,790
Oh, thank you so much.

13590
10:27:42,850 --> 10:27:44,050
There's so many people watching today.

13591
10:27:44,410 --> 10:27:45,570
I can't believe I was on the...

13592
10:27:45,570 --> 10:27:47,430
I was like top 5 Marble Rivals streams today.

13593
10:27:47,670 --> 10:27:48,130
Bye, guys.

13594
10:27:48,210 --> 10:27:50,470
Oh, to be fair, there was zero competition, to be fair.

13595
10:27:51,130 --> 10:27:52,510
It was late night queues.

13596
10:27:52,590 --> 10:27:54,090
Late night DJ queues.

13597
10:27:54,270 --> 10:27:56,430
And like, there was actually zero competition.

13598
10:27:56,970 --> 10:27:57,910
Alright, bye, guys.

13599
10:27:58,150 --> 10:27:58,390
Bye.
