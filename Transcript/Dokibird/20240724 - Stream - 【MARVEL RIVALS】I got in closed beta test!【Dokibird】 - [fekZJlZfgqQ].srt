1
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,830
Sorry guys for being late.

2
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,390
I went outside to get food.

3
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,990
Cause I was hungry.

4
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,970
And then cause I didn't eat dinner last night.

5
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,230
I was like so...

6
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,670
Oh my god.

7
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,190
Sorry I don't have ADHD.

8
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,350
I just got distracted.

9
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,150
Alright.

10
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,190
Doki bird.

11
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,250
I swear to god.

12
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,670
Somebody claim fucking doki bird.

13
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:12,670
Doki bird.

14
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,230
Uh.

15
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,570
Terms of use.

16
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,110
Okay good.

17
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,570
Nobody claim doki bird.

18
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,190
Nobody else claim doki bird during the beta test.

19
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,150
That's great to know.

20
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,190
Alright.

21
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,790
Oh no you guys are not seeing the cool ass intro.

22
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,590
I'm so sorry.

23
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:26,890
No!

24
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,510
Sorry.

25
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,330
You guys missed out on the cool ass intro.

26
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,270
It was really fucking cool.

27
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,230
You guys missed out on the cool ass intro.

28
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,470
Because I was too... Oh my god is this window capture?

29
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,830
I forgot.

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,270
This is window... Oh my god I forgot.

31
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,450
Sorry I'm a mess right now.

32
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,750
I literally just got back from eating.

33
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,150
And then I could have went straight to do stream.

34
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,270
But then I also...

35
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,790
Teehee.

36
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,450
I also... Other than eating I also went over to... To pet my dog.

37
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,290
Because like he deserves it cause he's a good boy.

38
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:10,930
Uh.

39
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,770
Hahaha.

40
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,030
So.

41
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,910
So.

42
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,870
So.

43
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,810
And then... And I didn't realize that there was a huge ass patch that was going on.

44
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,470
So I had to wait for the patch to finish and everything.

45
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,550
But I didn't eat dinner last night and I didn't eat... Oh my gosh.

46
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,870
Dad is still here looking at me.

47
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,910
Did you miss me?

48
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,690
Did you miss me?

49
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,590
Ugh.

50
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,530
You know how like... Okay I don't know if like your dog does this.

51
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,270
Um.

52
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,510
But like whenever like...

53
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,090
My...

54
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,390
Whenever like I stick my hand out.

55
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:49,970
Uh.

56
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,970
Dad like gets two little stubby hands and like um...

57
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,550
And like latches onto one hand while I pick him up.

58
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,070
Hahaha.

59
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,410
And it's so cute.

60
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,850
Like he... He has... He just latches onto one arm.

61
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,430
Like... Like... Like a koala.

62
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,610
And then like... And then I pick him up.

63
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,330
Hahaha.

64
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,850
It's so fucking cute.

65
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,670
Oh my god.

66
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,290
And then he started tucking his head underneath my...

67
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,110
Arms' now.

68
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,250
Awwww.

69
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,450
Sorry.

70
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,390
Sorry.

71
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,210
I don't have ADHD, I'm just...

72
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,350
I- I think I don't have ADHD.

73
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,990
Um.

74
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,850
But yes.

75
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,550
That's why.

76
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,730
I'm really sorry for being late.

77
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,110
Umm.

78
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,810
I didn't have lunch and I didn't have dinner last night because I was so tired...

79
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,230
that I went straight to bed.

80
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,790
I went...

81
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,430
Straight to bed.

82
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,710
And then...

83
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,570
Um, and then I just slept all the way until 3pm.

84
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,290
I slept all the way until...

85
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,870
No not even 3pm.

86
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,550
I slept all the way till 4pm.

87
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,350
And then after that, I woke up and went out to eat at a...

88
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,070
You know, took a shower, went out to eat at a restaurant.

89
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,630
And... Oh wait, no!

90
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,010
JK!

91
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,170
I woke up to make my waiting room.

92
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,510
And then I went back to sleep.

93
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,010
I was like, I gotta make my waiting room.

94
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,090
And I made my waiting room, went back to sleep.

95
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,590
And then I woke up at 4, took a shower, and then went out to eat.

96
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,850
Because I was so fucking hungry.

97
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,250
Since I didn't eat anything.

98
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,130
And then I finished eating at like 4.50 or whatever.

99
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,590
And I fucking... I like... sprint walked over...

100
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,910
I hate... I hate... What is it called?

101
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,290
Because I know sprint walking is an actual Olympic sport.

102
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,310
What is it called again?

103
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,870
That thing where you like... Power walk!

104
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,790
Is it power walk?

105
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,310
Because I know that's an Olympic sport.

106
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,650
Yeah, I power walked back home.

107
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,290
And then dad was like pet me.

108
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,110
And then I was like, ooh, okay, I'm sorry, dragoons.

109
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,410
But if dad wants petsies, that's important.

110
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:03,130
So... So I was petting dad for like a couple of minutes before I was like, okay, now...

111
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,550
I... I turn on the PC.

112
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,490
But yes!

113
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,390
Anyway, speaking of Olympics, they just... literally just announced that...

114
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,390
E-sports is gonna be an Olympic sport now.

115
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,910
You know how... Okay, for those who didn't watch the collab with Zen...

116
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,050
And Amelie, I was talking about how like they had...

117
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,590
Video games as an Olympic sport, but they weren't really like...

118
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,230
They weren't really... E-sport titles.

119
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,230
They were like archery and... Like archery and soccer and all that.

120
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,030
And like...

121
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,870
It's like... It's like Wii sports, but like Olympics anyway.

122
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,370
So they had that back.

123
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,030
But today, they... The committee finally voted in...

124
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,730
They finally voted in...

125
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,090
E-sport titles as a real... As a real Olympic...

126
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,810
For the real Olympics.

127
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,070
But the funniest thing is that there's no FPS games.

128
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,710
I thought that was so funny!

129
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,890
I... I fucking... You guys were like coping.

130
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,510
They're like, no!

131
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,450
FPS isn't dying!

132
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,350
I fucking... Shooters are dead!

133
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,670
You know what?

134
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,330
FPS shooters... Not just FPS...

135
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,050
But shooters in general!

136
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,270
Shooting games!

137
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,910
It's dying!

138
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,470
We're not even invited!

139
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,670
League... Rocket League got into the Olympics!

140
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,410
Before us!

141
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,370
That's fucked up!

142
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,970
Mobile games are in the Olympic E-sport games!

143
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,450
Is that fucked up?

144
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,650
Like...

145
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:43,930
Mobile games are in it!

146
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,950
And shooters are not!

147
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,090
We are the new RTS of the generation!

148
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,670
We are the RTS of this generation!

149
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,990
Anyway, speaking of... Speaking of shooters...

150
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,430
I'm gonna be playing Marvel Rivals!

151
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,170
I...

152
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,250
Alright, you guys wanna know...

153
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,310
Which... Okay, these are the games I got in.

154
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,670
League of Legends...

155
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,010
Rocket League...

156
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,610
Street Fighter...

157
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,730
Tekken...

158
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,890
iRacing!

159
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,750
NBA 2K!

160
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,390
How the fuck do you make an Olympic sport out of NBA 2K?

161
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,110
Anyway, and then there's FIFA and mobile games.

162
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,910
So...

163
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,210
All I'm saying is that...

164
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,890
Developers... Publishers of shooting games did not give them a big enough check.

165
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,410
Because apparently, majority of these games that got in...

166
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,450
Was funded by the Saudi government.

167
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,030
So...

168
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,510
So...

169
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,910
So...

170
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,010
So...

171
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,750
I'm surprised Apex didn't get in.

172
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,330
Because...

173
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,150
Because...

174
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,350
Falcon has an Apex team.

175
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,130
That's literally Imperial House team.

176
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,310
So...

177
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,650
So...

178
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,110
So...

179
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,130
So...

180
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,310
So...

181
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:01,350
So...

182
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,690
So...

183
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:01,730
So...

184
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,010
All I'm saying is that Apex did not pay enough to be in the Olympics.

185
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,510
They literally had oil money.

186
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,630
We don't have oil money, guys!

187
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,630
The shooter...

188
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,690

Yes, it's the actual Olympics.

194
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,650
They literally voted for the Olympic eSport games.

195
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:38,930
No!

196
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,230
We deserve oil money!

197
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,050

198
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,250

Thank you!

203
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,010
Yeah, unfortunately we did not have enough funding to have...

204
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,770
We didn't have enough funding for...

205
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,850
To be in the Olympics.

206
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,530
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat!

207
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:07,850

I told you guys!

210
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,530
I think I'm really good at analyzing the current trends.

211
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,450
Because I told you guys.

212
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,650
I was like, oh yeah, fighting games.

213
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,610
Fighting games are clearly like on the rise right now.

214
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,010
Because I mean they're expanding.

215
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,650
They literally announced like an expansion for Evo.

216
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,210
So...

217
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,170
I had a feeling that fighting games is like the newest gaming trend.

218
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,250
Um...

219
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,670
Alright, let's see.

220
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:32,910
Alright!

221
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,070
So, Marvel Rivals!

222
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,390
Marvel Rivals!

223
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,790
Um...

224
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,870
A huge shout out to the devs for giving me an invite to Marvel Rivals closed beta.

225
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,050
I did an alpha.

226
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,090
I did the alpha test.

227
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,470
And now I'm here for the closed beta!

228
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,610
So, the interesting about it is that there are new characters now.

229
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,050
Venom's in here now.

230
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:53,750
Whoa!

231
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,550
I hope the volume is okay.

232
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,490
I don't know if Sound Guy is still at Evo.

233
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,130
Oh, that's so cool!

234
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,170
Wait, I want to watch that again.

235
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,390
That is actually really cool.

236
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,630
Oh!

237
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,890
Yeah, the devs DMed me on Discord to give me some codes.

238
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:10,890
Um...

239
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,450
Let's see.

240
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,530
Using his symbi- Oh, it's Eddie!

241
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,810
It's Eddie Brock!

242
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,150
Oh!

243
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,230
That's so fucking cool!

244
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,010
I really like the animation.

245
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,970
We can be- Oh, we can be Blue Eddie!

246
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,090
First appears in Marvel Rivals.

247
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,250
Oh, this is his first appearance!

248
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,250
Sight and Clash.

249
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,150
Surrender now or I'll be feasting on you.

250
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,390
What's the difference between- I guess he's blue.

251
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,690
Oh!

252
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,150
Oh my god, that's so fucking cool.

253
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,690
Wait, I really like- Is he a tank?

254
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,310
What is he?

255
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,390
Okay, abilities.

256
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,850
Wait, I want to know what is he.

257
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,890
He is- What is that?

258
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,610
What is two fists?

259
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,630
Oh, you guys can't see it.

260
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,430
Uh- Okay, you can see his head.

261
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,050
What is two arms?

262
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,750
Oh, he's a tank!

263
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,590
Okay, that makes sense because of his hip box.

264
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,850
Okay, he's a tank.

265
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,130
Oh, he's a tank.

266
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,130
All right, what does he do?

267
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,870
Unleashes tentacles forward to attack enemies.

268
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,770
Oh, that's his normal primary.

269
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,810
Feast of- Oh!

270
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,810
Okay, I'll bring up the game volume a little bit.

271
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:11,770
Okay.

272
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,410
All right.

273
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,090
What is this?

274
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,370
I didn't get to see this.

275
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:15,870
What is this?

276
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,090
Underground for free movement.

277
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,060
Oh my god!

278
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,380
What the fuck?

279
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,860
Wait, that's so cool.

280
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,500
That's his Q.

281
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,360
What's his shift?

282
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,060
Oh, he can swing around!

283
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,680
Oh, he can swing around!

284
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:32,700
Oh, he can swing around!

285
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,600
Hey, dad.

286
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,860
Sorry, he looked up at me and was like, kiss?

287
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,700
And I was like, okay.

288
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,960
All right.

289
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,600
Symbiote generates bonus health against damage.

290
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,620
The greater the bonus health generates- Oh, what?

291
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:49,960
Oh!

292
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,800
That's, um...

293
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,780
That's basically Hammond!

294
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,520
That's Hammond, Orisa, Sigma thing.

295
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,700
Where you press it and then you get like health back.

296
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Oh, that's- Oh, frenzy arrival.

297
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,180
What's this?

298
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,580
Ooh.

299
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,940
That's the- Oh, so I brought up the volume a little bit more in the sound guide.

300
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,700
Thank you for the five-kithed ships!

301
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,060
Thank you!

302
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,600
Thank you!

303
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,500
Cellular corrosion.

304
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,860
Unleash technicals to slow enemies within reach.

305
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,700
Okay, that- That slows them down and also gives them that- Also damages them.

306
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,020
And then- Oh my- Oh, that's the Spider-Man shit!

307
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Okay, that- No matter what this and the Spider-Man one is like, it's so disorienting.

308
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,500
I- I do not- I don't know how anybody can play this.

309
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:50,660
Because like, we were Spider-Man, we were like fucking everywhere and I was like- I wanted to- I don't get motion sickness, but like that shit fucking sucked.

310
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,240
Like- Alright, what's this?

311
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,980
Venom shares a part of the symbiote with Spider-Man Peter Parker, activating your symbiotic abilities.

312
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,200
Spider-Man Peter Penny Parker can convert this time into explosive spikes.

313
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,400
Oh, so like, if we have Penny and- Oh my god!

314
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,180
What the fuck?

315
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,420
Okay, that's cra- That's actually crazy.

316
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,060
Alright.

317
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,020
What's this?

318
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,820
Hero story.

319
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,280
Oh my god, you can unlock hero stories?

320
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,440
Alright.

321
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,880
I just realized I should check the- the- my settings.

322
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,920
My settings for this.

323
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,740
Oh no.

324
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,260
Not fucking- No, no, no, no, no.

325
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,020
Alright, let's see.

326
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,860
Limit FPS.

327
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,680
Uh... 120?

328
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,800
That's like the max?

329
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,500
I didn't even realize that was the max.

330
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,560
There's no way!

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,560
Okay, show my FPS please.

332
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,260
Yeah, I realized they reset everything.

333
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,060
Oh yeah, everything has been reset.

334
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,980
Okay, I'm gonna set medium.

335
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,660
Um...

336
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,920
Confirm.

337
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,200
I forgot everything has been reset.

338
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:56,900
Uh...

339
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,540
Fullscreen...

340
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,640
Uh...

341
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,460
V-sync...

342
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,660
Audio...

343
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,080
Let's see...

344
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Alright, audio guy.

345
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,020
Let me know what I should bring up from here.

346
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,820
Uh...

347
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,400
Playback, voice chat...

348
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,900
Voice over subtitles...

349
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:15,720
Yeah.

350
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,920
We always want voice over subtitles.

351
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,380
Uh...

352
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,260
I don't know.

353
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,080
I actually don't know if...

354
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,200
If this is the default.

355
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,880
I don't know.

356
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,220
I don't remember.

357
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,380
Has anyone...

358
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,620
Did anyone get into the beta?

359
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,180
Is this the default or do I have to redo my...

360
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,780
Um...

361
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,020
Uh...

362
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,840
Meme settings at 100?

363
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,260
No, it's at 200 and...

364
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,460
Okay.

365
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,100
Okay, dad, you're going down.

366
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,160
Alright.

367
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,380
Is that default?

368
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,560
Dad, this is the...

369
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,680
Okay, that's default.

370
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,460
Alright, I have to change that then.

371
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,660
Uh...

372
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,580
Let's see...

373
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,440
Dot...

374
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Oh my god.

375
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,010
Everything reset.

376
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,510
Everything reset!

377
00:15:59,230 --> 00:15:59,830
No!

378
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,330
I hate it when everything resets itself.

379
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,410
Play with dot...

380
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,630
Ally on...

381
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,090
Um...

382
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,710
Is melee...

383
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,010
Did they reset melee as well?

384
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,390
Melee attack.

385
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:11,990
Yeah, they did.

386
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,910
Everything is reset.

387
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,830
So guys, nothing...

388
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,310
Alright.

389
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:15,610
Oh.

390
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,530
Sorry, dad's gone now.

391
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,910
They actually reset everything!

392
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,570
Oh, that sucks.

393
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,890
That really sucks.

394
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,770
Because I know...

395
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:25,990
I know...

396
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,650
I know that...

397
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,890
Alright, bring mastery to 11...

398
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,350
Oh, 100.

399
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:31,710
Okay.

400
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,950
I know that like...

401
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,910
I...

402
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,790
I had like specific controls.

403
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,830
So...

404
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,310
Yeah.

405
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,790
I hate it when that happens.

406
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:39,890
Because...

407
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,310
Ah...

408
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,110
Because I...

409
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,710
I didn't...

410
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,610
Does anyone remember what my sense was?

411
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,390
Did anyone?

412
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,470
Guys!

413
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,510
Can anyone go through my...

414
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,670
My first Marvel Rival streams and tell me what my sense is?

415
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,990
Please, my sense is...

416
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,730
I need to know!

417
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,750
I need to know what my sense is!

418
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,590
Somebody check my VOD!

419
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,230
People are like, why don't you check your own VOD?

420
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:11,230
Because then you guys can plus more views on it and I can get more ad...

421
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,170
At least I'm being truthful!

422
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,230
At least I give it to you straight and I don't lie!

423
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,370
Okay?

424
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,870
1.09.

425
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,290
Nice.

426
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:23,650
Okay.

427
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,990
1.09.

428
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,970
1.09.

429
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,810
1.09.

430
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,890
Is it 1.09?

431
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,730
Is it actually?

432
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,050
That's not smart!

433
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,610
Look, I give it to you straight.

434
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,230
I don't...

435
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,690
I didn't lie about it.

436
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:41,970
Okay?

437
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,590
Alright.

438
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,630
Is it actually 1.09?

439
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,170
Okay.

440
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:48,410
1.

441
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:48,890
Okay.

442
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,590
1.09.

443
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,170
That's great.

444
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,750
Thank you guys.

445
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,770
And thank you for giving me that plus one view on that Marvel Rival VOD so I can get one more cent.

446
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,470
And add revenue.

447
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,430
I really...

448
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,750
I really appreciate it.

449
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,310
Thank you for boosting my viewer engagement on the other VOD as well.

450
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,070
For those who are watching the VOD, hey, can you guys...

451
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,230
For those who are watching the VOD, can you comment down below what my sense is in the...

452
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:21,550
For those who are watching that VOD, comment below to tell me what sense I was using on my last VOD.

453
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,870
Anyway, let's see.

454
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,610
I think that's everything.

455
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:25,970
Okay.

456
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,930
I think.

457
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,810
I'm gonna double check.

458
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,070
Yeah, I think that's everything.

459
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,730
I think that's all I have to reset in.

460
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,090
Alright.

461
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,030
What are the other ones?

462
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,210
I know there was another...

463
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,190
They added another new hero.

464
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:37,950
Oh yeah!

465
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,470
There you go!

466
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,290
Adam Warlock!

467
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,410
This is the other guy.

468
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,490
The gold guy!

469
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,190
The guy with mommy issues!

470
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,490
The genetically engineered Adam Warlock wields mighty quantum magic, allowing him to...

471
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,070
Wait, is he a fucking heel slut?

472
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,750
I don't know.

473
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:55,930
I don't know.

474
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,670
Oh, he is!

475
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,670
Wait, he is?

476
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,830
Oh my god!

477
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,830
He is!

478
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,530
He was so strong in Guardians of the Galaxy!

479
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,610
Alright.

480
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,770
And heals souls with a gentle touch when the time comes for his allies to unite.

481
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,390
But like, he killed so many people in Guardians of the Galaxy!

482
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,730
I don't understand!

483
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,710
Cosmic Jade.

484
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,390
Okay.

485
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,110
So that's him but with jade colors.

486
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,390
That's the NC version.

487
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,190
He got better!

488
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,850
He became a support player!

489
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:37,950
He's better!

490
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,770
Alright, what's this?

491
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,590
Launch the quantum energy to deal damage.

492
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,110
Wait.

493
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,630
Is this?

494
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,210
Oh my god!

495
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:51,850
He's Mercy!

496
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,430
Oh my god!

497
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:57,550
Mercy!

498
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,130
He's mercy!

499
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,050
He is!

500
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,050
He's a heel slut of Marvel Rivals!

501
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,110
Die!

502
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,550
I have Rezz!

503
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,810
He has the OG Rezz ability!

504
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,210
Everybody, die on point.

505
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,030
I have Rezz.

506
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,850
Everybody, die on point!

507
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,990
No way!

508
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,630
Guys, die on point!

509
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,330
I have reds!

510
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,130
I have karmic revival!

511
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,530
Guys, I have karmic die on point!

512
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,890
Oh gee, Brissy.

513
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,010
We're running it back.

514
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,310
Avengers never die!

515
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,670
Monster, thank you for the super chat.

516
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,470
Thank you, thank you.

517
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,490
Fun fact, Adam Warlock in the comics is the primary enemy of Thanos.

518
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,570
Thank you for the super chat.

519
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,350
Thank you, thank you.

520
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,470
That's his ult too, by the way.

521
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,570
That's his ult.

522
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,590
Unite the souls, granting them healing over time and distributing damage taken across the bond.

523
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,990
Oh, okay.

524
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,170
So like we share the damage... wait, that's so fucked.

525
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,850
Wait, do they die?

526
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,170
Oh my... wait, that's so fucked.

527
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,370
Wait!

528
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,430
Oh, you guys like take damage.

529
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,650
You guys like share damage as a soul bond.

530
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,330
Oh, you guys like take damage.

531
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:19,330
You guys like share damage as a soul bond.

532
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,790
What's this?

533
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,470
I mean, this is actually a really cool ability.

534
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,990
Target an enemy for a bouncing stream of healing, which also heals himself upon casting.

535
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,750
Self-targets if no ally is selected.

536
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,230
Uh... oh, okay.

537
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,530
Okay, so healing them will heal me.

538
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,390
I see.

539
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,790
Uh... what's this?

540
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,710
And then swiftly launch... okay, that's just the attack.

541
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,430
And then regenerative cocoon.

542
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,570
Adam can freely move as a soul and reforges his body.

543
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,410
Oh!

544
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,890
So he has... he has second life.

545
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,670
Wait, that's... wait, he's pretty broken.

546
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,230
I think his heal must not be that strong then.

547
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:05,210
He must not have a strong heal because like all his heals are... all his heals are abilities.

548
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,130
Yeah.

549
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,010
He... all he... all he does... he can attack.

550
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,350
There's this damage.

551
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:17,630
His like secondary and primary are damage, but his healing ability are abilities.

552
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,570
Like, I mean... sorry, his Because healing are just abilities.

553
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,410
So basically, he's mostly...

554
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,870
He's like a DPS more than a healer.

555
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,930
He's like a DPS more than a healer.

556
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,430
Umm...

557
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,390
I feel like.

558
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,150
And then he can...

559
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,650
Okay, what's this?

560
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,290
Enhances the Reaper power of Starlord.

561
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,230
Oh, they will all... If you have Starlord and Mantis, they can also revive.

562
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,390
His E is strong and has two charges.

563
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,470
Oh, this one?

564
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:44,870
Okay.

565
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,630
It has two charges.

566
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,970
Yeah, but I feel like he's more so of a damage character.

567
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,290
Because he only heals from his abilities alone.

568
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,130
So he doesn't heal from anything else.

569
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,310
So there's only two new characters?

570
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,070
I believe... This is why I mean...

571
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,530
Wait, wait.

572
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,990
No, not her.

573
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,950
This is Juno.

574
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,170
This is literally Juno.

575
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,730
But like, K-pop.

576
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,330
This is literally her.

577
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,310
Alright.

578
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,370
Umm...

579
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,470
Let's see.

580
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:16,370
Umm...

581
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,670
It's the clap healer.

582
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,670
Yeah, it's clap to heal.

583
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,590
That's her.

584
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,230
Alright, so...

585
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,750
What did sound guy say?

586
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,290
Bring up... Turn down sound effects and bring up... Alright.

587
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,150
Let's see.

588
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,870
Sound effects...

589
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,890
Let's bring you down.

590
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,010
And then I'll bring you down to 85.

591
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,810
And then I'll bring up the volume a little bit.

592
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,110
Boop, boop, boop.

593
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,730
There you go.

594
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,350
I brought it up a little bit.

595
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,150
Alright guys, time to check it out.

596
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,670
Time to check out the game.

597
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,650
It's just me.

598
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:56,850
Quick match, conquest, respond to a flexible location and eliminate as many... Oh, is this deathmatch?

599
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,910
I think this is deathmatch.

600
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,150
This has to be deathmatch.

601
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,470
Cause it's like conquest.

602
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,390
Yeah, she claps to heal.

603
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,190
Uhhh...

604
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,010
And you'll bring more effects than just healing.

605
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,230
Monster, thank you super chat.

606
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,730
Thank you, thank you.

607
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,610
Yeah, that's very interesting.

608
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,530
Because like Adam is clearly a very like DPS character.

609
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,770
Um... Versus the healer.

610
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,590
So it's very interesting to like see in general.

611
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,210
Alright, royal palace.

612
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,410
Time for deathmatch.

613
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,170
I wanna play Adam.

614
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,970
Let's see what it's gonna be like as Adam.

615
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:34,750
Alright.

616
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,230
Where is...

617
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,110
Alright.

618
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,950
To maintain a fair game environment, voice chat...

619
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,490
Oh, okay.

620
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,450
You're recording.

621
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,310
Alright, that's cool.

622
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,030
Alright.

623
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,390
What is everybody else playing for deathmatch?

624
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,550
Is this deathmatch?

625
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,250
I should...

626
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,230
I don't know.

627
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,650
Is it?

628
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,970
Yeah, but like...

629
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,090
Wait!

630
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,270
Oh!

631
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,690
Oh, it's a team deathmatch!

632
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,090
Okay, it's team deathmatch.

633
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,050
Alright.

634
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,330
And then...

635
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,590
Okay, I can charge the...

636
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,570
I can charge that.

637
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,970
Oh, what the f...

638
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:17,850
Oh, we're straight in!

639
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,250
Okay, we're straight in!

640
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,090
Okay!

641
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,770
Holy shit!

642
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,010
That is so disorienting!

643
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:27,610
I'm sorry.

644
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,090
That is actually so disorienting.

645
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,270
I was not ready for that.

646
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,190
Oh my god!

647
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,530
There's so many things!

648
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,290
Ah!

649
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,490
The workacoon!

650
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,310
Oh god.

651
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,810
Oh god, I'm running away!

652
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,010
I'm running away!

653
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,590
Bro, what the f...

654
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,890
They only have 10 kills!

655
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,310
Eww!

656
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,170
Jesus Christ!

657
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,950
Okay guys, I don't know if I wanna...

658
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,010
Guys, I...

659
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,850
Who am I playing against?

660
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,770
Are they f... in a stack?

661
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,110
Cause what the f... is going on?

662
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,350
They have to be in a stack or something!

663
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,530
Cause what the...

664
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,610
Oh god.

665
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,290
Oh god.

666
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,270
This is bad.

667
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,870
This is...

668
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:19,930
What?!

669
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,590
This is...

670
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,850
Alright, who is...

671
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,750
Alright, it's time.

672
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,670
It's time.

673
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,930
I don't remember the abilities, but it's time.

674
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,970
By the way, I don't remember the abilities at all, guys.

675
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,770
I think I forgot I think I remember like, the one thing I did not like is I did not remember the abilities.

676
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,490
Oh god!

677
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,790
I remember now!

678
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,190
I have to set these up!

679
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,490
I'm really...

680
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,390
Okay, this should not have been my first game.

681
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,130
I'm so disoriented right now.

682
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,970
I am really...

683
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,170
disoriented.

684
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,390
Holy shit.

685
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,370
Alright!

686
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,390
That was fast.

687
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,890
That was so fast!

688
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,590
That was so fast!

689
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,890
Alright, we're gonna play Conquest another time.

690
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,370
I...

691
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,570
I can't.

692
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,610
I literally did not have time to learn the game.

693
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,890
I did not!

694
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,430
Bro!

695
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,330
I didn't have time to learn the game!

696
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,030
What?!

697
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,810
Alright, Conquest fucking sucks.

698
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,850
I'm gonna do a quick catch.

699
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,630
Okay.

700
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,370
If you want to learn the game, do not play Conquest.

701
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,910
I did not have time to like, register anything.

702
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:56,190
I literally showed up and then the enemy team got 20 kills in literally 10 seconds.

703
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,530
I don't know how that was possible.

704
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,750
I don't know how that was possible.

705
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,970
That was so fast.

706
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,610
Oh, the game is over.

707
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,170
How did I get 10 kills that fast?

708
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,530
Okay, now I can learn the game.

709
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,630
Okay.

710
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,170
Let's see.

711
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,450
F1.

712
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,170
I need to remember.

713
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:20,610
Okay.

714
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,130
Q.

715
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,590
Shift is to Soulbond.

716
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:24,730
E.

717
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,310
Okay, Shift is Soulbond.

718
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,710
E is to Avatar Lifesteal.

719
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,470
Okay, so E is to heals and I can get Soulbond to people.

720
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,570
Alright, I'm just gonna get Soulbond to everybody.

721
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,110
Um...

722
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,390
I'm gonna get Soulbond to everybody I see.

723
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,530
Why learn when you can die?

724
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,670
Jesus Christ.

725
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,850
Alright, it's okay.

726
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,990
We're fine now.

727
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,270
We're fine now.

728
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,850
We've learned how to play this game now.

729
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,330
Everything is fine.

730
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,070
I can finally learn... Wait, this isn't even a map.

731
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,770
This is a new map, right?

732
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,010
Or is this...

733
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,110
Yeah, wait.

734
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,890
Is this...

735
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,310
No, no, no.

736
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,590
This is not the new map.

737
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,550
This is an old map.

738
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,210
It looks a lot better.

739
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,730
Wait, they changed stuff.

740
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,510
I just realized.

741
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,750
Alright, Soulbond time!

742
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,730
You too!

743
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,550
You're Soulbonded even if you did not want to be.

744
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,090
Congratulations!

745
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,570
Congratulations!

746
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,430
Oh, God.

747
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:36,870
I have to reload.

748
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,130
There is not a lot of ammo, by the way.

749
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,070
There is not a lot of ammo.

750
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,430
Holy shit!

751
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,690
Get hit!

752
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,450
Get hit!

753
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,990
Oh, I guess...

754
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,850
Get hit!

755
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,370
I keep thinking... I keep trying to shoot the heal right now.

756
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,370
This is not good.

757
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,710
Come on, Magneto's load!

758
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,410
Soulbond!

759
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,750
Even if you didn't want to, you're Soulbonded now!

760
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,570
I don't like the lack of ammo.

761
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,810
I'm not gonna lie.

762
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,410
I feel like I do not have a lot of ammo.

763
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,170
Get Soulbonded!

764
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,410
It's okay.

765
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,590
Oh, wait.

766
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:24,870
He's one.

767
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,170
He's one.

768
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:25,610
Nice.

769
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:25,970
I got him.

770
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:27,410
Okay.

771
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,170
Yeah!

772
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,450
Well, poor Spider-Man already used up my abilities.

773
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,410
Wait.

774
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,390
Who was that?

775
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,310
Who's that?

776
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,030
Who's that?

777
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,010
Who did that?

778
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,410
Oh, God.

779
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,150
Get healed!

780
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,810
Get healed!

781
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,650
Soulbounded!

782
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,670
Even if you didn't want to!

783
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,370
Oh, my God.

784
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,890
Clap to heal!

785
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,130
Clap to heal!

786
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,510
Nice.

787
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,350
Easy.

788
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,270
It's so fucking easy.

789
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,250
Alright.

790
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,090
Aggressive healing.

791
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,950
I don't know what some of these items are.

792
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:08,830
Alright.

793
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,350
Nice.

794
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,870
What is that?

795
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:11,730
Who is that guy?

796
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,670
Heals.

797
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,230
Get healed!

798
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,010
Get Soulbounded!

799
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,290
Get Soulbounded!

800
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,430
That's fucking right now your best friend!

801
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,350
Heal!

802
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,030
Wait.

803
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,970
I snapped a heal.

804
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,490
That's cool.

805
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,250
I like that I'm snapping my heal.

806
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,570
I like that I'm snapping my heal.

807
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,210
Soulbound!

808
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,090
Raise!

809
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,770
I have raise!

810
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,030
There you go!

811
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,690
Best decision of my life!

812
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,470
Woo!

813
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,670
There you go.

814
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,050
All the buttons!

815
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,330
Snap!

816
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,130
Oh, don't!

817
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:54,630
I can't snap!

818
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,270
I can't snap!

819
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:55,490
Snap!

820
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,450
Hahaha!

821
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,470
I snapped guys!

822
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,290
Snap to heal!

823
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,510
Snap!

824
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,790
Hahaha!

825
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,390
I tried my best!

826
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,630
Alright.

827
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,290
Soulbounded!

828
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,290
You're best friends now!

829
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:11,910
You're welcome!

830
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,610
You're welcome!

831
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,790
You're now best friends!

832
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,510
Alright.

833
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,330
It's only the support alive right now.

834
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,410
But I can headshot though.

835
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,110
So it's fine.

836
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,090
Guys!

837
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,210
Where's our tank?

838
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:26,930
Guys!

839
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,310
They're getting closer!

840
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,210
Guys, where's our tank?

841
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,470
I do not feel safe!

842
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,610
Snap!

843
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,090
Hahaha!

844
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,750
Friend!

845
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,930
Oh, get away healer!

846
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,090
Only I can... Snap!

847
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:41,830
Snap!

848
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:42,870
Hahaha!

849
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,810
Oh shit!

850
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,130
I like the snap ability.

851
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,290
It's actually really fun.

852
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,030
Hahaha!

853
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,470
Bro, who keeps healing this bitch?

854
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,470
Hahaha!

855
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:54,950
Hahaha!

856
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,290
Best friends!

857
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,310
What does the soulbound do?

858
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,890
Basically, like, it makes it so...

859
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,770
Um...

860
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,330
Snap!

861
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,270
Snap!

862
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:04,910
Oh no!

863
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,090
Oh no!

864
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,030
I don't wanna fear... Oh!

865
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,790
He missed!

866
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,490
That's fucking right, bitch!

867
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,030
Get shit out!

868
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,730
Snap!

869
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,310
Snap!

870
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,630
He's too far away!

871
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,170
I can't snap!

872
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,530
He's... Oh, I don't have abilities.

873
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,150
That's why.

874
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:18,970
That makes more sense.

875
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,370
I just did it.

876
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,290
What the fuck?

877
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,670
Is he that... Not him?

878
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,130
Is that... Hahaha!

879
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,110
Why is he moving?

880
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,450
Oh god.

881
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,570
I... Die!

882
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,430
I have friends!

883
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,590
Die on point!

884
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,650
Die on point!

885
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,690
Die on point!

886
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,730
I don't think I should, like, spam that though.

887
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,150
I should use that when, like, we're actually in danger.

888
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,270
Hahaha!

889
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,690
Oh no, he's gonna dance!

890
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,790
He's gonna dance now!

891
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,710
Soulbound!

892
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,590
Okay, nice.

893
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,310
This is so easy.

894
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,490
Wait, already?

895
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,590
That's a really fast ult.

896
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,830
This is such an easy game.

897
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,890
This should have been my first game.

898
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:04,910
Hahaha!

899
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,850
Stop shipping!

900
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,130
No, I'm shipping my own team!

901
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,350
That's different!

902
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,490
Bro, this is sad.

903
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,810
This is so... This should have been my first game.

904
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,390
Hahaha!

905
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,370
Yay!

906
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:21,630
Yay!

907
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,970
I'm gonna make a big victory!

908
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,370
Big win!

909
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:26,790
Soulbinding.

910
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,290
I'm just making sure they're, like, best friends now!

911
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:30,970
Hahaha!

912
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,910
They are...

913
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,770
No, they're real people!

914
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,490
They're real people!

915
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,770
Hahaha!

916
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:39,730
Hahaha!

917
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,370
So fucking easy.

918
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,810
I know, cause I got absolutely fucking destroyed in my first game.

919
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,630
Like...

920
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,710
There's no way.

921
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,430
There's no way these guys aren't real.

922
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,950
I got destroyed in my first game.

923
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:57,570
Chat.

924
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,370
I...

925
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,130
Jesus Christ!

926
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,530
9000 damage!

927
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,350
There's no way.

928
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,730
A bot would not be...

929
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,210
There's no way.

930
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,650
This has to be a real person.

931
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,490
I refuse.

932
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,590
I will prove to you this, guys, that this is a real person.

933
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,450
I'm gonna add them as a friend.

934
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,050
Hahaha!

935
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,430
Hahaha!

936
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,010
I will... I will prove to you they're a real person!

937
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,910
Cause I will add them as a friend.

938
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,430
If they accept they're real.

939
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,870
Hahaha!

940
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:33,450
Hahaha!

941
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:33,910
Hahaha!

942
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,410
No way.

943
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,850
Hahaha!

944
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,470
A.I.

945
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,910
best friend.

946
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,550
Alright.

947
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,190
What if...

948
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,410
If bots and A.I.

949
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,710
is truly taking over?

950
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,580
If bots can add friends?

951
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:50,950
I don't know.

952
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,330
I think Adam's pretty fun.

953
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,830
I don't like his projectile speed that much though.

954
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,690
His projectile speed is not like the best.

955
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:58,910
No!

956
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,310
They took Adam!

957
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,130
No!

958
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,370
Um...

959
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,770
That was fun to play.

960
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,630
Alright.

961
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,810
I remember she was fun.

962
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,430
Uh... let's see.

963
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,890
Shift... E...

964
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,530
Project an explosive...

965
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:18,610
No!

966
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,170
I forgot her abilities!

967
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,190
Please!

968
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,110
I wanted to read a little longer!

969
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,090
Play magic!

970
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,970
But magic has like portals and melee!

971
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,990
And I get very confused!

972
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:31,810
Okay.

973
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,490
There's that.

974
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,490
And then...

975
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,610
What was the E again?

976
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,470
How do I look at her thing?

977
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:39,770
Okay.

978
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,170
There you go.

979
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,190
Uh... E... Okay.

980
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:42,770
To stun.

981
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,150
Okay.

982
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,230
That stuns.

983
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,450
And then...

984
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,150
This is my escape ability.

985
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:47,990
Okay.

986
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,530
Uh... Okay.

987
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,290
I can fall slowly.

988
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:50,730
Okay.

989
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:53,790
Wait.

990
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,090
How do I fall slowly?

991
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,650
Oh there you go.

992
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:56,970
Weeeee!

993
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,330
Alright.

994
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,650
I know Hela is like really strong.

995
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,630
Like especially her ult.

996
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,230
What the fuck?

997
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:06,490
Oh!

998
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,930
That's just the...

999
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,610
The decoration.

1000
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,830
Okay sorry.

1001
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,570
I got really confused.

1002
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,970
I was like what the fuck is that?

1003
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,930
Oh that's the card!

1004
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,810
Wait that...

1005
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,130
I swear to god that was not what it looked like before.

1006
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,910
That was not what it looked like.

1007
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,330
Take us!

1008
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,250
Someone save the tank!

1009
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,950
Someone save the tank!

1010
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:28,950
Oh no I'm so bonded.

1011
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,230
Who am I best friends with?

1012
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,030
Who am I...

1013
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,470
Who is my best friend?

1014
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,410
Okay.

1015
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,650
I need to know who it is.

1016
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:40,770
Okay.

1017
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,250
Alright.

1018
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,010
I need to use my...

1019
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,850
I need to know who it is.

1020
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,070
Our... our Loki is like tanking so hard.

1021
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,930
Get over there!

1022
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,810
That's right!

1023
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,030
No!

1024
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,430
He can block that?

1025
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,390
Wait that's new!

1026
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:54,970
That is new!

1027
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,070
We gotta get the tank.

1028
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,830
Come on!

1029
00:37:59,290 --> 00:37:59,770
Headshot!

1030
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,710
No!

1031
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,510
Stupid Reinhardt's shield!

1032
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,750
What the fuck?

1033
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,090
Who's that?

1034
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,710
Oh that's Iron Man.

1035
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,230
Come on, man!

1036
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,230
Come on!

1037
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,810
Come on, anime!

1038
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,630
You can't glide forever!

1039
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,410
God damn it.

1040
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,050
Okay, he can.

1041
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,170
Come on, man!

1042
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:15,650
That's right!

1043
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,250
Get over here!

1044
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,910
That's fucking right!

1045
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,010
Yeeeeeeah!

1046
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,910
Wait, why am I flying?

1047
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,290
How did I start flying?

1048
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,810
Who got me up in the sky?

1049
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,430
Who got me there?

1050
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,990
Alright, get that rocky raccoon.

1051
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,510
Goodbye.

1052
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,810
Goodbye, rocky raccoon.

1053
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,910
Oh, shit!

1054
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,230
Oh no, it's Magneto.

1055
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,930
It's Magneto.

1056
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,210
Guys!

1057
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,010
He has Zarya bubble!

1058
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,690
Okay, I'm gonna just...

1059
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,590
Let's just walk, guys.

1060
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,350
Let's just walk away.

1061
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,030
We don't have to be there.

1062
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,150
Wait, no!

1063
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,790
This is a new map.

1064
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,630
I've never seen this map before.

1065
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,510
Alright, get that rocky raccoon.

1066
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,730
Get over here.

1067
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,430
Get over here, you rodent!

1068
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:04,510
Oh, shit!

1069
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,230
I'm joking!

1070
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,290
JK, JK, JK!

1071
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,930
Where am I getting shot from?

1072
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,770
Oh, it's you.

1073
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,270
No.

1074
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,010
So, buy me!

1075
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:14,830
So, buy me!

1076
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,810
So, buy me!

1077
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,150
Okay.

1078
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,610
There we go.

1079
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,030
Nice.

1080
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,630
That's fucking right!

1081
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,150
Oh, I see you!

1082
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,050
I have waz!

1083
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,170
Nice.

1084
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,330
Easy.

1085
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,030
Don't choke!

1086
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,010
I never choke.

1087
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:39,790
Watch this.

1088
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,730
Wait, where am I getting shot from?

1089
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,550
Oh, shit!

1090
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,550
So, buy me!

1091
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,150
So, buy me!

1092
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,330
I know we have an Atom!

1093
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,570
I know we have an Atom!

1094
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,050
I know we have an Atom!

1095
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,330
Oh, my god!

1096
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,350
Oh, god!

1097
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:54,770
Oh, god!

1098
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,710
Where am I getting shot from?

1099
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,570
No, that's not...

1100
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,830
I'm so confused.

1101
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,750
Like, where am I getting shot from?

1102
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:01,830
Oh, that's you!

1103
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,710
That's fucking right.

1104
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,910
You can't fuck with me.

1105
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,390
Yeah, Hela's damage is insane.

1106
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,830
Yeah, Hela's damage is insane.

1107
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,490
She used... her damage used to be really, really good.

1108
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,690
But, like, I feel like they buffed her damage.

1109
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,330
Not gonna lie.

1110
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,450
Oh, we have high ground?

1111
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,190
We have to go up?

1112
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,790
Where are they?

1113
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,350
Get over here.

1114
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,310
You think flying's gonna stop you?

1115
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,030
Oh, I see you, little guy!

1116
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:29,890
Oh, I see you, little guy!

1117
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,710
I see you!

1118
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,350
Where did he go?

1119
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,830
Oh, wait!

1120
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,350
It's Atom!

1121
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,670
Get over here, Atom!

1122
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:40,190
That's fu- Get your ass over here!

1123
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:41,990
Oh, no!

1124
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,430
Save me!

1125
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,330
So, buy me!

1126
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,630
Oh, thank god!

1127
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,490
Oh, thank god!

1128
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:52,630
Alright.

1129
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,690
I'm okay.

1130
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,890
I'm okay.

1131
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,430
Sorry, it was an overreaction.

1132
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,250
Sorry, it was just a little overreaction, but I'm okay now.

1133
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,690
They know the carry!

1134
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,070
They're always trying to...

1135
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,070
Oh my god.

1136
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,110
Oh, that was scary.

1137
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,790
I don't know what that was!

1138
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,230
I have no idea what that was there.

1139
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:17,730
Okay.

1140
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,830
Am I gonna go high ground?

1141
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,090
Maybe?

1142
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,030
Oh, shit!

1143
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,250
Nice!

1144
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,050
Okay.

1145
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,870
I can only literally hit one person.

1146
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,470
Guys, break the...

1147
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,870
Break the area!

1148
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,170
Yes!

1149
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:30,770
Oh!

1150
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,290
Nice!

1151
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:32,490
No!

1152
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,570
It's fine.

1153
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,950
We're fine.

1154
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,990
We're fine.

1155
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,410
And then...

1156
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,250
Where's my team?

1157
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,210
Wait, did everybody die?

1158
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,370
I am not fine.

1159
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:42,690
Goodbye.

1160
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,130
Goodbye, everybody.

1161
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,710
I didn't realize everybody was dead.

1162
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,850
I didn't...

1163
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,050
How long is this point?!

1164
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:51,950
I...

1165
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,990
Venom, are you okay?!

1166
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,470
But also, how long is this point?!

1167
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,630
I swear!

1168
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,450
I swear to god, this is...

1169
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,250
Okay.

1170
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,050
I can fucking kill you.

1171
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,330
Wait, where...

1172
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,770
Wait, that's not fair!

1173
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,230
He just flew away!

1174
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:15,950
That's not fair!

1175
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,490
That's fucking right.

1176
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,850
Okay, I did back off a little.

1177
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,690
I do have the soul bond.

1178
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,970
So we're fine.

1179
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,210
Jesus!

1180
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,770
This is so hard to push!

1181
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,370
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1182
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,590
Oh, oh!

1183
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,770
Where did you come from?!

1184
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,810
It's okay, I'm a crow!

1185
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:37,750
I'm crow now!

1186
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,270
Any heals?

1187
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,050
Thank you, he snapped a heal.

1188
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,230
Jesus Christ!

1189
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,190
This one area is so hard to push.

1190
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,270
This is like the Anamura.

1191
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,090
Oh, he's insane!

1192
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:50,550
Get him!

1193
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,350
He's insane!

1194
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,430
No bot would just fucking stop moving.

1195
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,930
That's when you know he's real.

1196
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,950
Why did he stop moving?!

1197
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,150
Oh, this is good.

1198
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:05,950
I have ult soon.

1199
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,430
The ult is so strong for this area.

1200
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,890
Wait, did we do it?!

1201
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,130
That's it?!

1202
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,950
They backed off!

1203
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,790
Wait, they just backed off and let us push that!

1204
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,930
That's fucking...

1205
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:22,650
right!

1206
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,930
Sorry, the bot stopped moving.

1207
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,090
That's fucking right.

1208
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,490
Endorse me.

1209
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,090
Oh my god!

1210
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,450
Okay, she is so strong.

1211
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,790
Wait, she's actually so fucking strong.

1212
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,210
Holy shit!

1213
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,370
11,000 damage!

1214
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,230
Oh my god!

1215
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,290
That's actually crazy.

1216
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,910
That's really...

1217
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,770
um...

1218
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:51,930
That's really...

1219
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,950
That's a lot.

1220
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,310
That's a lot!

1221
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,610
Compared to everybody else.

1222
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,650
That's right.

1223
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,230
You all...

1224
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,550
Who the fuck is she?!

1225
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,710
What did she do?!

1226
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,790
She had 6k...

1227
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,590
You guys are stacking, you fucking losers.

1228
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,670
She did nothing!

1229
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,070
You really gotta get...

1230
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:21,930
Give the person who has 6k half my damage!

1231
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,250
The same amount of endorsements?!

1232
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,610
The same amount of endorsements?!

1233
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,170
There's no way a bot do a stack.

1234
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,410
Affiliate, thank you for 10k!

1235
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,210
Give the shivs!

1236
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:40,510
Thank you!

1237
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:42,090
Alright.

1238
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,970
Oh, I'm fucking...

1239
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,110
Okay, they have zero support.

1240
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,290
Oh wait, no, they have Rocket Raccoon.

1241
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,470
It's Adam time.

1242
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,270
Oh my god.

1243
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,290
Don't worry.

1244
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,610
It's Adam time.

1245
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,150
Snap to heal.

1246
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,450
Don't worry, everybody!

1247
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,810
I am rea- Where do I go?

1248
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,030
Guys!

1249
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,990
The moment I figure out this map!

1250
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,030
Do not worry, everybo- Snap!

1251
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:14,730
Snap!

1252
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,870
So bonded!

1253
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,490
Best friends forever!

1254
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,290
Where are they?

1255
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,230
I think the only issue- Jesus Christ!

1256
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:26,630
Guys!

1257
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:27,190
Guys!

1258
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,110
I don't have a lot of snaps to give you guys!

1259
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:31,410
Guys!

1260
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,430
I'm running out of snaps!

1261
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,210
Chill!

1262
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,030
Snap!

1263
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,210
Guys, I'm running out of snaps!

1264
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,990
Nooooo!

1265
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,270
We got so fun!

1266
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,630
I'm trying to snap!

1267
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:50,090
I'm trying to snap!

1268
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:50,450
I'm trying to snap!

1269
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:54,650
Guys, I don't- Guys, these guys are good!

1270
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:56,530
We're so bonding!

1271
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,690
Oh god!

1272
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,810
I'm running out!

1273
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:04,730
Snap!

1274
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,390
Okay.

1275
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,890
Guys, I can't snap forever.

1276
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:14,750
You guys can't be best- I don't have enough friendship bonds for all of you.

1277
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,250
You guys can't be best- I don't have enough friendship bonds for all of you.

1278
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,250
I don't have enough friendships!

1279
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:19,530
Friendship!

1280
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,750
Guys, I'm running out of friendship bracelets!

1281
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,250
Snap!

1282
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:27,890
Please!

1283
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:34,650
Snap.

1284
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,370
Oh my god, I snapped so many times.

1285
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,350
So bad!

1286
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:40,530
Oh god.

1287
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:41,550
No!

1288
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,710
It's okay, I have cocoon.

1289
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:45,990
Goodbye.

1290
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,330
I should not have cocoon there.

1291
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,430
Little spiders, get over here.

1292
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:54,390
Little spiders.

1293
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,790
Leave me alone!

1294
00:46:59,390 --> 00:46:59,930
Snap!

1295
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,330
Oh god, I'm sorry.

1296
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,370
You're fucking dead.

1297
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,630
I'll do born again here.

1298
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,510
I don't think our team is good.

1299
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,530
Guys, I have a feeling my team is dog shit.

1300
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,170
Just a little bit.

1301
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,230
Oh my god.

1302
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,250
These guys... Snap!

1303
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:23,530
Snap!

1304
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:23,650
Snap!

1305
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:23,830
Oh!

1306
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:24,950
Fuck them!

1307
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:25,910
They know!

1308
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:28,890
Please.

1309
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,970
Somebody soul bond right now.

1310
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:32,370
Snap!

1311
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,510
Oh god.

1312
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,470
Oh god, there's so many soul bonders.

1313
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,730
No!

1314
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,290
No!

1315
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:44,830
No!

1316
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,610
Thank god!

1317
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,350
Oh, thank god he's bad!

1318
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,490
Thank god!

1319
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:49,910
Snap!

1320
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:54,130
This is so hard to control sometimes.

1321
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,190
This is so hard to control sometimes.

1322
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:57,710
Oh, who's feasting?

1323
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:58,410
Who's feasting?

1324
00:47:58,610 --> 00:47:59,830
Who's feasting?

1325
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:01,970
I don't have snap!

1326
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:02,810
I'm sorry, sir lord!

1327
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:03,910
I'm sorry!

1328
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,310
I didn't prep enough friendship bracelets for everybody!

1329
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,310
I didn't prep enough friendship bracelets for everybody!

1330
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:13,710
Okay.

1331
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:14,930
Snap.

1332
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:15,970
Okay.

1333
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,170
This is actually so difficult.

1334
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,270
Oh my god.

1335
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,730
I'm so disoriented.

1336
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:24,570
Who are you?

1337
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:25,550
Peter Parker?

1338
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,010
Oh god, Peter Parker.

1339
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:28,970
Soul bond.

1340
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:29,330
No!

1341
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,030
Yo, you're dead!

1342
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,270
Somebody get Peter!

1343
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,030
Somebody get him!

1344
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,110
Oh god.

1345
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,490
Oh god.

1346
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:41,730
It's okay.

1347
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,270
I have health pack.

1348
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,330
I'm trying my best.

1349
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,410
I don't do enough heals for this.

1350
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,830
Snap!

1351
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:55,470
Snap!

1352
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,310
Please!

1353
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:58,590
Please!

1354
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:59,030
Please!

1355
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,230
Please!

1356
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,490
Don't die on point!

1357
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:03,770
I'm so disoriented right now, guys.

1358
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:07,150
Oh god!

1359
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:07,990
Oh god!

1360
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,310
Oh god!

1361
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,870
This is one...

1362
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:11,850
This is really one...

1363
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:12,610
Oh god.

1364
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:13,710
Oh god.

1365
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,170
I'm snapping!

1366
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,430
I'm snapping out of fear!

1367
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,590
Oh god.

1368
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:23,330
Okay, we're good.

1369
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:24,170
We're okay.

1370
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,230
We're okay, guys.

1371
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,550
Everything...

1372
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,530
Everything is fine.

1373
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,450
Sorry, I'm getting...

1374
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,730
This is a lot.

1375
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,630
Get away!

1376
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:41,310
Friendship!

1377
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,810
Oh no, I can't do friendship right now.

1378
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:44,790
I need two seconds cooldown.

1379
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:48,330
I feel like I see somebody behind us.

1380
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,850
Is somebody behind us?

1381
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:52,450
No!

1382
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:53,930
Friendship!

1383
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:55,010
Okay.

1384
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,130
That's good.

1385
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:58,790
Oh no.

1386
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,650
They went Marvel Aquaman.

1387
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,170
I'm sorry for all...

1388
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:04,730
Namor?

1389
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,710
Where is his movie?

1390
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:09,930
Oh shit.

1391
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:10,150
No.

1392
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:11,930
I have to heal by myself.

1393
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:12,230
I have to heal by myself now.

1394
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,110
I'm sorry.

1395
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,990
I'm sorry.

1396
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,990
Oh no!

1397
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:18,010
Please live a little bit longer!

1398
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:20,130
Okay.

1399
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,710
I don't have enough heals.

1400
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,930
I don't have enough snaps for everybody.

1401
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,810
Please calm down!

1402
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:29,790
Okay, nice.

1403
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:30,970
We're good.

1404
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,110
Where is he?

1405
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:34,970
Alright, he's over there.

1406
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,450
I mean, we're doing a lot better than the other team.

1407
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,630
Last game.

1408
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:40,870
When they had to defend.

1409
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,030
Honestly.

1410
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,310
He does not want friendship.

1411
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,030
Get him from the turret for him.

1412
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:49,270
Ooh.

1413
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:50,170
Okay, snap.

1414
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:51,730
Friendship on.

1415
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,870
I feel like it's good to give that to...

1416
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,130
Oh, he's one!

1417
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,890
Holy shit!

1418
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,190
Oh, I think our tank died.

1419
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:01,910
I think...

1420
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,330
Guys, I think our tank died.

1421
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,130
That... snap!

1422
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,310
Oh, he's dead.

1423
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:11,030
Get the fucking shit on.

1424
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,070
Get the fucking shit on.

1425
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,290
Get the fucking shit on.

1426
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,150
Get the fucking shit on.

1427
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:17,610
That's bright.

1428
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,230
I can fucking aim, bitch.

1429
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:20,770
I can fucking aim, bitch.

1430
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,350
That fish was insane, though.

1431
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:26,230
That fish was insane, though.

1432
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,330
That fish was scary as hell.

1433
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:30,290
Alright.

1434
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,150
Nice.

1435
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:35,570
Alright, nice.

1436
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,090
I think we're doing really well.

1437
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,430
That is not fair!

1438
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:38,930
That is not a bot!

1439
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,590
A bot would not have a Twitch name!

1440
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,210
Did you not see that?

1441
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,630
I saw the Twitch name!

1442
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,570
A bot would not have a DDP name!

1443
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:51,110
A bot would not have a DDP name!

1444
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,950
A bot would not have a DDP name!

1445
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,410
A bot would not have a DDP name!

1446
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,650
The real DDP...

1447
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,150
Oh my god!

1448
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,170
Was that a fucking noob?

1449
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:01,630
Come on.

1450
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,070
That's fucking right.

1451
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,110
You think you can...

1452
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,190
Oh, wait.

1453
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:05,790
Nevermind.

1454
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:06,090
You can.

1455
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,350
Okay, friendship bond?

1456
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,170
Oh, friendship bond, please.

1457
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,110
Please.

1458
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:11,790
Oh god.

1459
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:12,590
I need help!

1460
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,210
I need help!

1461
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,210
Let me live!

1462
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:14,850
Snap!

1463
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:16,690
Alright, good.

1464
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,130
We're fine.

1465
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,510
We're fine.

1466
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:19,710
We're fine.

1467
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:21,610
Snap.

1468
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,850
Oh, I snapped the wrong person.

1469
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:23,290
I'm sorry.

1470
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,670
You're gonna die now.

1471
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,090
I snapped the wrong person.

1472
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,030
I'm sorry.

1473
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:32,350
You were so far.

1474
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,150
Nice, we got an assist.

1475
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,810
Dude, they're all air!

1476
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,370
They know like...

1477
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,610
Fucking bots can't...

1478
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,030
Sorry, my teammates can't shoot air characters.

1479
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:46,550
Nice.

1480
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:47,150
We're good.

1481
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:48,950
We did it!

1482
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,550
Don't know bots have CTV.

1483
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:58,470
But the test made the bots the CTV name.

1484
00:52:58,990 --> 00:52:59,790
Yeah!

1485
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,170
I'm MVP!

1486
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,910
Nice.

1487
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,030
What is it?

1488
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:05,630
Oh, okay.

1489
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,490
It's cause I healed.

1490
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:07,390
Oh, yeah.

1491
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:08,350
Wait, how am I MVP?

1492
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:09,690
Wait, what?

1493
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:10,090
That's right.

1494
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:10,870
Endorse me.

1495
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:11,990
That's right.

1496
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:12,410
Come on.

1497
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,350
Come on, everybody.

1498
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,410
I am literally the healer.

1499
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:16,410
You have to endorse me.

1500
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:17,090
That's the rules.

1501
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,210
Guys, what?

1502
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,710
This is not a team game.

1503
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:21,570
This is...

1504
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,010
My teammates aren't team players.

1505
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:26,210
Wait, I don't even have the most damage.

1506
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,170
How do you have 626 damage?

1507
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,790
You literally only have 1000 more heals than me.

1508
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,830
Wait, how did I get MVP?

1509
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,250
How did I get MVP?

1510
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,610
He has more damage than me.

1511
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,190
Oh, the second highest kills?

1512
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:44,630
Oh!

1513
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:46,950
Oh!

1514
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,970
Oh, it's cause I have 6N kills.

1515
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:49,470
No!

1516
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:51,530
No, cause Justin has 21.

1517
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,830
Praise me.

1518
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,490
Exactly.

1519
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,150
Look, see?

1520
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:56,390
CTV.

1521
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,490
I knew they were real.

1522
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,530
I knew they were real.

1523
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:01,890
Oh, I can see their highlights.

1524
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,590
What's my highlight?

1525
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,330
What did I do?

1526
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,130
Oh.

1527
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,480
Oh, it could be my KDA too.

1528
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,960
I had a really good KDA.

1529
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,480
I think Adam's pretty fun to play.

1530
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:22,740
Alright.

1531
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,100
Can I play DPS?

1532
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,500
No.

1533
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,560
Can I play DPS?

1534
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,300
Please?

1535
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:30,480
Please?

1536
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,960
Uh, requesting back Nito's Scarlet.

1537
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:35,740
No, fuck off.

1538
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,960
I'm gonna play Lowkey.

1539
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,760
I feel like Adam's a more fun version of Lowkey, not gonna lie.

1540
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:43,940
Uh...

1541
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,660
Alright.

1542
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,120
We'll do Lowkey.

1543
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,380
I didn't get a chance to actually play Lowkey.

1544
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:55,080
I need to remember how to play him.

1545
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,420
But Lowkey bird.

1546
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,160
Alright, let me...

1547
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,020
I need to remember how to play Lowkey though.

1548
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:02,640
It's been a while.

1549
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,720
Okay, shift shift into target enemy and use...

1550
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,480
Okay, that was the...

1551
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,160
Okay, magic field that can bring damage.

1552
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,320
Oh, this is the damage.

1553
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,580
Okay, shift this to damage.

1554
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,260
Double Ganyan.

1555
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,140
Swap.

1556
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,220
Back stab.

1557
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,420
Uh, and conjure an illusion.

1558
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,540
Okay, I need to remember all...

1559
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,680
I forgot that Lowkey was...

1560
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,780
I forgot that was why Lowkey was four stars.

1561
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,500
Holy shit!

1562
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,600
That is a lot.

1563
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,180
Oh!

1564
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,180
Oh, like...

1565
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,860
There we go.

1566
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,460
Okay.

1567
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,060
I forgot how complicated Lowkey was.

1568
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,300
Hahaha!

1569
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,600
That was a lot of information!

1570
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,200
Not gonna lie.

1571
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,660
Oh, god.

1572
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,640
There we go.

1573
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,800
There we go.

1574
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,240
We're fine.

1575
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:56,720
We're fine.

1576
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,120
We're in our little...

1577
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:58,680
orb.

1578
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,400
We're fine.

1579
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,460
Get the venom.

1580
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,940
Guys, we gotta get venom!

1581
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,500
Jesus Christ.

1582
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,720
Somebody help!

1583
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,120
Jesus Christ!

1584
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,300
Magneto, you're taking so much damage!

1585
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:22,520
Um, guys, you're all taking a lot of damage.

1586
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,040
Guys.

1587
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,740
Guys, you're taking a lot of damage, everybody!

1588
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:29,880
Wee-woo!

1589
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,260
Hahaha!

1590
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,100
Did they nerf Lowkey?

1591
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,880
She does not do a lot of heals.

1592
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,660
Or they're taking a lot of damage!

1593
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,400
It's one or the other.

1594
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,120
I can't tell.

1595
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,480
Hahaha!

1596
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,460
Everybody is taking so much damage.

1597
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,800
Jesus Christ!

1598
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,640
I am healing so much, too!

1599
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,760
I'm actually healing a lot.

1600
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,120
Okay, no.

1601
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,240
Is that new?

1602
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,100
Is that a new orb?

1603
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,180
Wait, is that...

1604
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,980
What?

1605
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,200
Is that a new orb?

1606
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,440
That wasn't his orb before.

1607
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,960
I swear to God!

1608
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,980
That was not his orb before.

1609
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,140
Like, I remember his orb was not like that.

1610
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,020
Yeah.

1611
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,480
That has to be new.

1612
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,160
I do not remember his orb being like that.

1613
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,620
That's why I was not... I didn't care.

1614
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,300
Hahaha!

1615
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,780
That's why I was like, ee-ee!

1616
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,740
Because I did not remember his shit.

1617
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,000
Okay.

1618
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,520
What happened to the spider?

1619
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,560
Why did he stop?

1620
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:56,500
Oh!

1621
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,180
There you go.

1622
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,920
He's won!

1623
00:57:59,020 --> 00:57:59,240
He's won!

1624
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,300
Guys, our team!

1625
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,300
Our team is struggling!

1626
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,620
I'm gonna be Venom, too!

1627
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,100
I don't know what his moves are, but I'm gonna fuck you up!

1628
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,880
Wait, where did he go?

1629
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,540
Oh my God, these guys are good.

1630
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,160
These guys are good.

1631
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,260
Because, like, what the fuck is going on?

1632
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:20,940
What?

1633
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,320
What is going on?

1634
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,480
What is going on?

1635
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:26,900
Okay.

1636
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,640
I think they nerfed Loki.

1637
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,680
I think they nerfed him.

1638
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,080
I swear to God.

1639
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,340
His heals are so weak.

1640
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:47,500
This game... This game in sort is inspired by Overwatch, I'm pretty sure.

1641
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,260
I swear.

1642
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,860
Like, his heals...

1643
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:59,940
I think it's because, like, the reason why I think that he nerfed him is that his heals is so low.

1644
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,000
I don't like how low his heals are.

1645
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,740
Like, the damage, too.

1646
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,360
He used to...

1647
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,600
Loki used to be so strong, but, like... But his damage is so weak.

1648
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,600
Oh, God.

1649
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,400
Oh, God.

1650
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:19,840
No!

1651
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,360
Had you...

1652
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,480
That shit is so broken!

1653
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,760
That shit was actually so broken.

1654
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,840
Oh, my God.

1655
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,340
Friendship.

1656
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,440
Friendship.

1657
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,280
Like, even the damage...

1658
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,200
Like, the damage is fucking stronger, too.

1659
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,960
Like, I feel like I'm actually killing people more easily.

1660
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,000
So bad!

1661
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,740
I think it's because Adam is new.

1662
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,000
So...

1663
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,240
Since Adam is new, they gave him more... They buffed his damage for sure.

1664
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,100
Like, I can feel the buff.

1665
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,760
That's fucking right.

1666
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,760
You can't run from me.

1667
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,780
Like, it feels easier.

1668
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,220
There you go.

1669
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,320
Riz.

1670
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,740
Oh, I am sorry.

1671
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,200
Whoops.

1672
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,900
I had to do that.

1673
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,040
Alright, nice.

1674
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,520
Oh, it's 99 now.

1675
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,260
So bad!

1676
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,320
Friendship!

1677
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:27,780
Friendship!

1678
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,160
Keep giving us friendship!

1679
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,520
Oh, shit!

1680
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,580
Okay, we're fine.

1681
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,160
We're fine.

1682
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:33,960
We're fine.

1683
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,120
I just need a snap.

1684
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,020
We're fine.

1685
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,020
Yeah, Adam hasn't been rebalanced.

1686
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:45,380
Yeah.

1687
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,280
Loki has definitely got nerfed hard.

1688
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,720
Like, the heals...

1689
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,800
The heals on him is like a lot worse.

1690
01:00:54,600 --> 01:01:00,500
Um, the heals on him is definitely like less than what he was on Alpha.

1691
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:05,380
And his damage for Loki is not as strong as Adam.

1692
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,840
I felt like I...

1693
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,260
I tickled people.

1694
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,820
I was like tickling.

1695
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,680
Even with like three Lokis.

1696
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,980
I wasn't doing shit.

1697
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:13,360
...

1698
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,260
Yeah, but Adam is fucking strong as hell though.

1699
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,680
Uh, illusion focused and heal damage.

1700
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,260
They retooled him?!

1701
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,540
Like, oh, so he's more like a spy then.

1702
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,800
So, like, Loki is a spy.

1703
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,920
Instead of like a healer.

1704
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,680
Uh...

1705
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,580
I hope like... I hope, uh...

1706
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:39,340
I think most likely we'll retool Adam.

1707
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,400
He's way too strong.

1708
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,600
I can literally like, uh...

1709
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,360
survive for so long because of it.

1710
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,360
I think the support isn't supposed to be DPS.

1711
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,780
But I wasn't even healing as much!

1712
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,120
Snapping was doing more heals than shooting my friends!

1713
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,860
I was doing more heals by snapping!

1714
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,240
That's right.

1715
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,100
That's fucking right.

1716
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,300
So fun!

1717
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,600
Friendship!

1718
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,200
Guys, guys, no!

1719
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:09,900
It's okay.

1720
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,840
Guys, Finnum tried to destroy friendship but I'm still alive!

1721
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,320
Okay, the fucking double...

1722
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,060
The fucking res back is so fucked up.

1723
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:23,740
Oh god.

1724
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,040
He's coming for me, guys.

1725
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,600
He's coming for me.

1726
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,520
He knows.

1727
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:28,880
No!

1728
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,900
He knows!

1729
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,680
He wants to ruin friendship!

1730
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,920
Oh my god!

1731
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,820
He wants to ruin friendship!

1732
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,560
He wants to ruin friendship!

1733
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,100
I thought...

1734
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,320
Yeah, that guy's a really good Venom player.

1735
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,160
Holy shit.

1736
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,400
That guy was like Venoming all over the place.

1737
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,600
Friendship is dead.

1738
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:57,860
Don't worry!

1739
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,360
Friendship is coming!

1740
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,100
Yay!

1741
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,780
Everything is good.

1742
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:10,850
Okay, that's Spider-Man is dog shit.

1743
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,230
That's so bad.

1744
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,190
That's so bad.

1745
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:15,870
Alright, snap.

1746
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:18,590
I'm just gonna chill here.

1747
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:20,650
Oh, he's low.

1748
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,010
He's low.

1749
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:22,990
He's low.

1750
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:25,650
What is he doing?

1751
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:27,530
You guys hear that?

1752
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:29,450
Friendship.

1753
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:30,470
Oh, there he is!

1754
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,470
That's fucking right.

1755
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,650
You can't destroy friendship, Finnum!

1756
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,570
You can't destroy him!

1757
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:38,170
Where did he go?

1758
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:39,190
Oh, there he is.

1759
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:39,770
Oh!

1760
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,550
I can't believe that that was not my Finnum!

1761
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:44,910
That was not my K-Pop star!

1762
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,610
Where is...

1763
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:48,550
Where is...

1764
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,110
Yeah!

1765
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,330
That was so ballsy of me to do.

1766
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:55,730
That was so ballsy of me to do.

1767
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:56,810
That was so ballsy of me to do.

1768
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,550
Wait, I still died?

1769
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,150
Where is my Rez?

1770
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:04,010
I didn't get the Rez?

1771
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:07,330
I thought I would get the Cuckoo Hood.

1772
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:09,890
Nice.

1773
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,030
At least my teammates get the Rez.

1774
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,530
I thought that was my K-Pop star.

1775
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,230
No one expected the Luna Snow.

1776
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:20,970
Yay!

1777
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,770
We did it!

1778
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:24,970
Oh my god.

1779
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:25,370
Did we win?

1780
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:26,490
That's two points!

1781
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:30,030
Suddenly K-Pop idol.

1782
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:31,250
Oh, it's on cooldown!

1783
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,990
I thought like every time you die, you get it.

1784
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,730
Yeah, it's like, it's a cooldown.

1785
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:36,950
Okay, I get it now.

1786
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,390
Oh my god, that Venom.

1787
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,470
That Venom did not like...

1788
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:48,690
He was like, fuck this one person in particular.

1789
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:51,170
The Venom was good though.

1790
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,230
I don't know, I endorsed myself.

1791
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,050
Uh... Their Venom was really good.

1792
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:00,050
It was like, only cause... Yeah, that's right.

1793
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:00,870
Endorsed me.

1794
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:02,890
Endorsed me.

1795
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,650
I healed you guys.

1796
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:04,790
I gave you guys friendship.

1797
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,250
He kept fucking diving me.

1798
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:08,670
That was crazy.

1799
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,210
I just kept snapping.

1800
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,250
He was a friendship hater.

1801
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:12,550
Yeah.

1802
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:13,250
He...

1803
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,330
He really did.

1804
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:19,610
He really did.

1805
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:19,610
He really did.

1806
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:20,970
That was so fucked up.

1807
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:21,910
That was so fucked.

1808
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:24,170
I was like, bro, wait a minute.

1809
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:24,470
I'm just...

1810
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:27,830
I'm just trying to give friendship to the people.

1811
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,090
Um, I wanna play DPS.

1812
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,690
I don't know, I don't like playing tank.

1813
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,530
I think tank is really boring for me.

1814
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:35,730
Um...

1815
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,350
I wanna play...

1816
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,110
I wanna play Tracer.

1817
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:41,690
Alright.

1818
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:43,050
What's Tracer like?

1819
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:45,530
Uh...

1820
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:54,810
In the age in a free fight and walk onto enemies in sight, loosen sword forward, fire a frenzy of shots causing damage to enemies within.

1821
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,110
I didn't get a chance to finish reading.

1822
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:03,170
Is this a spider again?

1823
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:06,110
Alright, let's see.

1824
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:06,810
We have a tank.

1825
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,130
3 DPS.

1826
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,210
We're... I think we're gonna do good.

1827
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:12,110
Alright.

1828
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:16,110
Dodge in direction in the movement and swiftly reload.

1829
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,670
Fire a frenzy...

1830
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:21,110
frenzy of shots causing damage to enemies within range.

1831
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:21,510
Okay.

1832
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,810
So it's like...

1833
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,450
Okay, that's that.

1834
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,850
And then...

1835
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:29,670
Alright, that's reload.

1836
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:30,890
Okay, I got it.

1837
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:35,650
Nice.

1838
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:38,730
Oh, charge is really nice.

1839
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:39,830
Actually.

1840
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:42,110
Wait, where did it show up?

1841
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:45,210
Ah!

1842
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:49,130
Yeah, he's like reaper... Wait, he got rid of the dash.

1843
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:52,070
Didn't he have more of a dash?

1844
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:56,570
I swear.

1845
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,590
He had more.

1846
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,000
Whoa!

1847
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,480
What the fuck, Spider-Man?

1848
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,920
What the fuck?

1849
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:11,450
No, he had... he had like...

1850
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:14,210
Um... he had a... more of a bigger dash.

1851
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:15,750
I remembered.

1852
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:16,710
Did he?

1853
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:20,110
Yeah, didn't he have a bigger dash?

1854
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,570
The Venom team up, yeah.

1855
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:25,770
I'm pretty sure.

1856
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:28,470
I'm pretty sure he had like a bigger dash before.

1857
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,570
Uh... now like...

1858
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,050
He doesn't have it anymore.

1859
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:35,850
This is fucked up.

1860
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:37,150
This is fucked up.

1861
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,210
This is fucked up.

1862
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,090
This is fucked up.

1863
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,890
This is fucked up!

1864
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,150
I don't like... I don't like him.

1865
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,790
I don't like him.

1866
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:51,150
Guys.

1867
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,030
I don't like him.

1868
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,290
I don't like Star-Lord.

1869
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,010
Alright, let's see.

1870
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,950
Oh!

1871
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:01,370
We have three deep... We do not even have... Okay, we have...

1872
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:02,530
Alright, let's see.

1873
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,270
Let's try...

1874
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:08,090
No, I didn't get a chance to figure out what I wanna play!

1875
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,450
I was trying to figure out!

1876
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:13,230
At least because I don't know how to play him.

1877
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,430
I don't know how to play this guy.

1878
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:17,290
Because of the range.

1879
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:19,410
The cooldown is insane though.

1880
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:21,950
You can get the cooldown really fast.

1881
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:25,350
...

1882
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:26,830
...

1883
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:30,050
...

1884
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:32,910
Bye!

1885
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:36,060
...

1886
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:40,900
Wait.

1887
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:42,440
...

1888
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:43,860
...

1889
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,080
Alright,

1890
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:49,860
let's play.

1891
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:50,680
Let's try.

1892
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,660
Let's do Soldier.

1893
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,600
Let's do Soldier.

1894
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,300
Let's do Soldier.

1895
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,280
I don't know.

1896
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,020
I thought I...

1897
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,120
Alright, what's that?

1898
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,180
Oh, it's a zip.

1899
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,720
And then...

1900
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,580
That's the smoke.

1901
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,320
Okay.

1902
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,500
And then I have turret for him.

1903
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,180
Alright.

1904
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:08,740
Alright.

1905
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,320
I am Soldier now.

1906
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:13,600
Phew!

1907
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,460
That's fucking right.

1908
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,020
What are you gonna do?

1909
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:20,980
Get in here!

1910
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,380
Get over here, Spider-Man!

1911
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:23,940
Wait.

1912
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:24,880
Get over here!

1913
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,500
It was worth it.

1914
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,740
It was fucking...

1915
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:32,080
Whoa!

1916
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:33,640
Oh!

1917
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,300
Get him away!

1918
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:34,800
Get him away!

1919
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:36,980
Okay.

1920
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,160
Weeew!

1921
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,420
I'm on hard ground now.

1922
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,220
That's fucking right.

1923
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:44,820
This is revenge.

1924
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:45,600
No!

1925
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,420
That's so fucked!

1926
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,420
He destroyed my platform!

1927
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,100
Now I don't have high ground anymore!

1928
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,020
That's so...

1929
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,820
That's so fucked!

1930
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:57,160
That's so fucked!

1931
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,620
He got rid of my high ground!

1932
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,640
He got rid...

1933
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,900
That's so fucked.

1934
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:06,600
Imagine getting rid of my high ground.

1935
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:07,160
Imagine getting rid of my high ground.

1936
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:08,780
Let's see.

1937
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,240
We're fine.

1938
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:11,620
Oh!

1939
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,920
Right click is a...

1940
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,540
shotgun.

1941
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,020
Okay.

1942
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:14,220
Okay.

1943
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:17,800
Okay.

1944
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:18,240
Alright.

1945
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:19,780
Where is he going?

1946
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:20,500
Where's Spider-Man?

1947
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,880
You can't fucking swing forever, Spider-Man!

1948
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,580
I can track!

1949
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,800
Spider-Man, I see you!

1950
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,140
You can't stay up there forever!

1951
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:30,820
Oh, he can.

1952
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,280
Guys, he can.

1953
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,820
I learned that he actually can.

1954
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,620
I learned that he actually can.

1955
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:40,120
I have the low ground now.

1956
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:41,860
Oh, God.

1957
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:43,720
That's fucking right!

1958
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:44,320
Pew!

1959
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,060
Oh, no.

1960
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,160
Oh, no.

1961
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,620
Yeah, don't mess with me!

1962
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,480
No, wait!

1963
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:51,760
Stop!

1964
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:52,120
Stop!

1965
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:52,360
Stop!

1966
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:52,960
Stop!

1967
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,640
It actually stopped.

1968
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,380
It actually stopped.

1969
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,000
Okay.

1970
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,200
It's alright.

1971
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,760
There's too many high ground players!

1972
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,340
I had to play Soldier to get them down!

1973
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,640
I had to...

1974
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,420
I keep forgetting about Turret.

1975
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:16,500
Why does Spider-Man always...

1976
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,500
Because he's always in the sky!

1977
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,880
Okay, I need to...

1978
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,360
I need to grab the zip.

1979
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,380
Okay.

1980
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,640
It's okay.

1981
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,660
I have high ground again.

1982
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:27,720
We're fine.

1983
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,300
Oh, Turret!

1984
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:29,480
Turret!

1985
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:29,560
Turret!

1986
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,720
No, I can't!

1987
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,380
I can't put a turret here?

1988
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,880
That's fucked!

1989
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,440
That is so fucked!

1990
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:37,620
Come on!

1991
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:38,240
No!

1992
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,240
No!

1993
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,300
No!

1994
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:40,740
No!

1995
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,620
That's so...

1996
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,580
Why?

1997
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:45,900
Wait!

1998
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:50,000
That's so...

1999
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,900
When will I ever get high ground?

2000
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,140
I'm so sad.

2001
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,280
I'm so sad.

2002
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,380
Because they keep getting rid of my high ground.

2003
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,980
Because they keep getting rid of my high ground.

2004
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:07,460
No!

2005
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,160
He's won!

2006
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:10,780
He's actually won!

2007
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:11,560
He's actually won!

2008
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,060
That's not fair!

2009
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,860
Why do they all hate me?

2010
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:21,240
I can't believe it.

2011
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:21,800
They keep...

2012
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,520
They keep taking away my high ground.

2013
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:27,200
That's not fair!

2014
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,760
I just won high ground!

2015
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,880
Bro, don't you get healed so...

2016
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,040
What the fuck?

2017
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,920
I just got set up!

2018
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,240
I just got set up!

2019
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,000
I just got set up!

2020
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,100
This is fucked, guys.

2021
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,340
That is fucked.

2022
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,680
I can't do anything.

2023
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,780
I'm getting cyber bullied.

2024
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,140
I'm getting cyber bullied.

2025
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,480
I'm getting cyber bullied by Scarlet Witch.

2026
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:06,440
I'm getting cyber bullied by Scarlet Witch.

2027
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,440
Bro, get the fuck...

2028
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,500
Get Venom out of here.

2029
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,000
Get Venom out of here.

2030
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,660
I'm fucking... This is my fort.

2031
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,480
Scarlet Witch, I fucking got you, Scarlet Witch.

2032
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,300
That's fucking right.

2033
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:21,380
You're not...

2034
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,380
You're not doing shit to me this time.

2035
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,240
That's fucking right!

2036
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,820
That's fucking right!

2037
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,140
Fuck you, Scarlet Witch!

2038
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,840
Oh no!

2039
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:37,420
Oh no!

2040
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,000
I'm sorry!

2041
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:38,540
I'm so sorry!

2042
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,120
I'm so sorry!

2043
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:39,760
I'm so sorry!

2044
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,340
Please!

2045
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,540
I'm so sorry!

2046
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,880
Get away from me!

2047
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,400
I can't!

2048
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,200
Oh my god!

2049
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,400
I'm sorry!

2050
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,520
Get away!

2051
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:55,400
She won't leave me alone!

2052
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,020
She won't leave me alone!

2053
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,580
I don't know what to do!

2054
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,580
Oh god.

2055
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,880
Oh my god.

2056
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,200
I need heals, I think.

2057
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,500
Oh, there you go.

2058
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:12,980
Okay.

2059
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:13,540
Nice.

2060
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,200
Okay, that was worth the risk.

2061
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,820
I knocked two.

2062
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,380
That was worth it.

2063
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,600
Okay, this guy is so good.

2064
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:23,580
Like...

2065
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,240
This guy is actually crazy insane.

2066
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,300
Oh god!

2067
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:30,620
Guys!

2068
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:30,900
Guys!

2069
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:31,180
Guys!

2070
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:31,600
Guys!

2071
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,120
Guys!

2072
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:33,140
Guys!

2073
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:33,400
Guys!

2074
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,420
We have the VF point, guys!

2075
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,660
Oh god!

2076
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,860
Guys, we can't get off this point!

2077
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,560
Guys, we can't get off this point!

2078
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,120
Guys, we can't get off this point!

2079
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,540
This is fucked up, cause they have...

2080
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:48,820
This is fucked up, cause they have...

2081
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,740
Cause they have...

2082
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:51,580
Oh god.

2083
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,440
Get him up.

2084
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,100
No, no, knockback Nino!

2085
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:54,800
Knockback Nino!

2086
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,000
No!

2087
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:58,680
No!

2088
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:58,900
No!

2089
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,080
Oh boy.

2090
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:02,640
Yes!

2091
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,060
No!

2092
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,660
No!

2093
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,360
I did it!

2094
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,160
I right clicked!

2095
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,520
I did have the cooldown!

2096
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,880
Oh, you have to swap?

2097
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,880
Oh, you can swap weapons?

2098
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,720
I didn't realize you can swap weapons.

2099
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,560
I was like, what are you guys talking about?

2100
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:25,560
I'm doing it!

2101
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,460
I just got the smoke!

2102
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:28,880
I just got the smoke!

2103
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,880
Okay, we're gonna do that.

2104
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:31,180
We're gonna try Soldier again.

2105
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,620
Now I know we can swap weapons.

2106
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,820
Now I know...

2107
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,100
Now I know we can swap weapons.

2108
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,840
We're gonna play Soldier again.

2109
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,340
Bro, I was getting cyberbullied by the Scarlet Witch!

2110
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,120
Bitch!

2111
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,420
Oh my god.

2112
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,760
Just some guy taking a little bit of the soup.

2113
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:57,440
Thank you.

2114
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:58,880
Keep an eye on him.

2115
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:05,380
If I get the cooldown Punisher as a main, there's probably gonna be an update where they give Frank his space guns, bike chain, and flaming skull head.

2116
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,240
Bro!

2117
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:08,340
Fuck that.

2118
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,940
Fuck that Scarlet Witch though.

2119
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:12,020
Just fucking Scarlet Witch.

2120
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,960
Just fucking Scarlet Witch.

2121
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:15,500
Just fucking Scarlet Witch.

2122
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,560
Holy shit.

2123
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,680
I got bullied so hard.

2124
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:27,940
Okay.

2125
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,900
Oh my god, there he is.

2126
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:30,980
Guys.

2127
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,380
Guys, there it is.

2128
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,460
Oh my god.

2129
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,100
He has two weapons?

2130
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,900
He didn't have two weapons before, right?

2131
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,720
Oh, it's a black...

2132
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,860
Yeah, that Venom was...

2133
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:44,780
No, not that Venom.

2134
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,040
That Scarlet Witch!

2135
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,200
That's good.

2136
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,160
Thank you, Super Chat.

2137
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:49,520
Thank you.

2138
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:53,220
That Scarlet Witch fucked me up!

2139
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,900
What he did?

2140
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,100
I just never used it.

2141
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,100
Wait, where's the entrance?

2142
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,260
Here, okay.

2143
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,780
Guys, I just never used it.

2144
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,540
I didn't realize that was a thing, guys.

2145
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,660
I'm gonna get in.

2146
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,280
That's fucking right.

2147
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:13,400
Get in.

2148
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,380
Come on!

2149
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,080
Come on, you know you wanna get in!

2150
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,080
I have the high ground!

2151
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,520
Oh, there's Scarlet...

2152
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,180
Oh my god, it's the same Scarlet Witch too!

2153
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,340
It's the same one.

2154
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,980
It's the same one, guys.

2155
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:23,580
I'm scared.

2156
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:24,420
It's her!

2157
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:27,260
It's her!

2158
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,080
Oh no!

2159
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,680
No, I need to get off the thing.

2160
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:38,840
Guys, it's her.

2161
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:40,200
It's her, guys.

2162
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,120
Get the Bruce Banner!

2163
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,500
Get the D.Va Bruce Banner!

2164
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,400
Oh no.

2165
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,320
Wait, do we have a Scarlet Witch?

2166
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,160
We don't.

2167
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,000
Okay, I'm gonna be Scarlet Witch if I die to her.

2168
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,820
I'll prove to her that I'm the better Scarlet Witch.

2169
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:04,600
I still love that Bruce Banner is the D.Va of Marvel Rivals.

2170
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,840
I think that's so funny.

2171
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,160
I think that's really cute.

2172
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,480
Where's that coming from?

2173
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,540
I hear shots.

2174
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:11,880
Oh no!

2175
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:17,190
Oh no, she's coming over.

2176
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:18,270
She's coming over.

2177
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:19,510
She's coming over.

2178
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,250
She's so low.

2179
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:22,870
She can fly twice?!

2180
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:23,170
Oh no!

2181
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,690
This bitch.

2182
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,970
I'm not letting you go.

2183
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,010
I know!

2184
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,010
She's coming over.

2185
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:34,630
No!

2186
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:37,330
I got baited!

2187
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:39,050
I got baited!

2188
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:41,290
The cooldown is so fast!

2189
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:47,250
She nearly was a thing and then she was a thing again!

2190
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:51,370
Why is her cooldown insane?

2191
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:54,590
How was I supposed to know?

2192
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:57,390
I didn't play Scarlet Witch yet!

2193
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,270
Oh no.

2194
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:03,930
Oh no, she has a shield?

2195
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:07,390
Okay.

2196
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:10,490
Oh no, I'm trying to find people.

2197
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:12,610
That's fucking...

2198
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:15,190
Oh no, she's hulking up.

2199
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:16,690
She's hulking up.

2200
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,150
No!

2201
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:20,930
No!

2202
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:21,790
No!

2203
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:24,230
It's time.

2204
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:25,990
It's time.

2205
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,770
I shall become the Scarlet Witch.

2206
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:29,710
I don't know how to play her.

2207
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:32,130
But I shall become the Scarlet Witch.

2208
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:37,030
Let it hit on a target or press the generate force field that stuns the enemy.

2209
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:39,970
Hold space, consume chaos to fire explosive.

2210
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:40,670
Okay.

2211
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:44,070
Stuns and then...

2212
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,430
Okay.

2213
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:45,490
Alright.

2214
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:46,890
It's time.

2215
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:48,770
It's fucking time.

2216
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:51,750
Okay, and then that's that.

2217
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,870
And then that's what she did to me.

2218
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:55,010
Wait.

2219
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:57,010
Oh, she has two charges!

2220
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:58,610
Oh!

2221
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:00,990
Okay, that makes sense now.

2222
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:03,430
Now that I'm actually that character.

2223
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:04,690
It makes sense.

2224
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,470
It's okay.

2225
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:10,370
It's okay.

2226
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:11,970
It's okay.

2227
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:15,850
Oh no.

2228
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,450
I can't.

2229
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:19,770
Everybody is so far away!

2230
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,490
Everybody is so far away!

2231
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,470
It's fine.

2232
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,130
It's fine.

2233
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:27,250
It's not fine.

2234
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:30,830
That's fucking right.

2235
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:32,630
That's not fucking right!

2236
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:38,590
It's hella time.

2237
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:42,730
Never mind.

2238
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:45,890
Hella is stronger.

2239
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:51,650
Hella is more fun.

2240
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:52,610
Hella is more fun.

2241
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:53,390
Hella is more fun.

2242
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,130
Hella I feel like I'm actually strong.

2243
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:55,530
Hella I feel like I'm actually strong.

2244
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:58,550
Wait, I hear a scarlet witch near us.

2245
01:20:58,690 --> 01:20:59,150
Wait, I hear a scarlet witch near us.

2246
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:02,330
I hear a scarlet witch right next to us.

2247
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:03,910
Oh no, she's like right there.

2248
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:05,070
Oh.

2249
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:05,950
Guys.

2250
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:07,510
Guys!

2251
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:11,530
Guys, where's our healer?

2252
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:15,870
Guys, I need you guys to heal me.

2253
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:17,110
Please.

2254
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,070
Please snap me just once.

2255
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,410
Guys, I need some snaps right now.

2256
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:22,570
I need snaps!

2257
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:25,790
Why do they all fly?

2258
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,010
Please!

2259
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:27,830
Snap!

2260
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:28,590
Snap!

2261
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,510
I really need snaps.

2262
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,310
I don't know why they don't snap.

2263
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:37,630
Okay.

2264
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:41,110
Oh god.

2265
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:41,910
Oh god.

2266
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,890
Where's the crow?

2267
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:43,970
Hella leave!

2268
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:44,970
Hella move!

2269
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:47,450
Get closer!

2270
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:49,570
Oh, that's embarrassing.

2271
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,010
Guys, I...

2272
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:56,830
Sorry, I wanted to live.

2273
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,370
I wanted to live.

2274
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:01,490
Oh no.

2275
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:02,530
Big Hulk.

2276
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,430
I'm sorry, I just wanted to live.

2277
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:11,590
Get baby D.va!

2278
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:14,790
Look, I really wanted to live.

2279
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:15,470
Okay, guys?

2280
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:18,390
Like, it was very important to me.

2281
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:21,790
It was...

2282
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:23,410
Somebody get the Scarlet!

2283
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,110
She's literally one!

2284
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:25,110
I'll get her myself.

2285
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:31,550
Guys, it wasn't that big of a waste.

2286
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:32,390
Right, guys?

2287
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:33,090
Wooo!

2288
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:35,570
Crow.

2289
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:37,530
Adam!

2290
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,050
Get out of there, Adam!

2291
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,380
Oh, god.

2292
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,340
Guys.

2293
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,940
We are not doing so well right now.

2294
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:52,860
Oh, snap.

2295
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:54,160
I need snaps.

2296
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:54,780
Wooo!

2297
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:57,460
Guys.

2298
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:58,900
Somebody healed me!

2299
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,520
I'm one!

2300
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:01,440
Guys!

2301
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,540
Oh, he's gonna catch me!

2302
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:03,960
Yes!

2303
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,580
Oh, thank god!

2304
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,420
I got friendship!

2305
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,500
Oh, thank god!

2306
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:09,780
Friendship saved me!

2307
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,320
Oh, come on!

2308
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:12,780
I have to reload!

2309
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,520
Wait.

2310
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,320
I hear somebody.

2311
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,520
Oh, there she is!

2312
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,440
I f***ing knew it.

2313
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,080
I f***ing knew it.

2314
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:21,540
That's right.

2315
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,940
You can't f***ing...

2316
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:25,480
You can't hide from me.

2317
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,500
You can't hide from me.

2318
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:28,340
That's right!

2319
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,300
Get sh** on!

2320
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,280
Alright.

2321
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:31,880
We're okay.

2322
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:32,260
We're okay.

2323
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,080
Everything is fine.

2324
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,540
Oh, there she is.

2325
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,780
No, I need to kill that Cosme.

2326
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,080
Judge!

2327
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:37,400
Jury!

2328
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:39,260
Executioner!

2329
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,300
I'm fine.

2330
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:40,820
I'll be okay.

2331
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:42,360
Oh!

2332
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,300
Oh!

2333
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,160
She got me on high ground.

2334
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,600
Oh!

2335
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:49,120
Oh!

2336
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,240
Leave me alone!

2337
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:53,960
Oh no.

2338
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,280
Oh, god.

2339
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,120
I'm reloading.

2340
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,500
This is...

2341
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,460
This is a little scary right now.

2342
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,300
I can't... There's so many things on my screen!

2343
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,540
There's so many things on my screen!

2344
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:07,180
Nice.

2345
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,700
Oh, sh**!

2346
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:11,300
Turret mode!

2347
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,180
Turret mode!

2348
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:12,680
Crow!

2349
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,720
Oh, sh**!

2350
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,040
Turret mode!

2351
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:16,040
Crow!

2352
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,000
Bitch!

2353
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:21,160
Get f**king crowed!

2354
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:21,860
Oh!

2355
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:22,740
Nice.

2356
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:23,960
Nice.

2357
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,920
I made violence over.

2358
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:26,360
Oh!

2359
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:27,460
Crow!

2360
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,000
Crow!

2361
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:28,620
Where's my crow?

2362
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:29,800
Crow!

2363
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:30,400
Crow!

2364
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:34,110
She's getting...

2365
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,830
Oh, god.

2366
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:36,970
Oh, thank god.

2367
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:38,570
Oh, thank god.

2368
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:39,610
It's okay.

2369
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,010
Hello, Moe time!

2370
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:44,530
That's f**king right.

2371
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:46,050
That's right.

2372
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:47,630
You're gonna go inside!

2373
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:49,270
That's cheating.

2374
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:51,170
That's actually cheating.

2375
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,630
He went inside.

2376
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:55,810
How the f**k do I...

2377
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:59,150
...endorse?

2378
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,090
I can't believe it.

2379
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:05,450
No more group for him.

2380
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:07,170
He went inside!

2381
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,630
That's so cheating!

2382
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,030
That should be illegal!

2383
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:13,230
Guys, I need heals.

2384
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,550
Guys, please.

2385
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:16,690
Please.

2386
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:18,030
I need heals.

2387
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:19,770
Please.

2388
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:21,290
Do we have zero...

2389
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,110
I think we have...

2390
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,970
Do we have zero healers?

2391
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:27,230
Like, what's going on?

2392
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:29,070
Oh, there you go, Adam!

2393
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:31,130
Friendship!

2394
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:34,190
Friendship came back to save me.

2395
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:37,790
Here we go.

2396
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,350
I need to remember to use E.

2397
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,950
I keep forgetting about the existence of...

2398
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:43,310
Oh!

2399
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:45,290
He's one!

2400
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:45,610
He's one!

2401
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:46,970
No!

2402
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,950
He used the f**king tank sh**!

2403
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:49,910
No!

2404
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:50,950
Don't teleport Adam!

2405
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:52,870
He's wearing my only heals!

2406
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:57,210
You can't kill him!

2407
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:59,210
I need the heals!

2408
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:05,110
Guys, I don't know how to...

2409
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:05,650
Adam!

2410
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:07,090
Adam!

2411
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:08,890
Nice.

2412
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:09,810
We're fine.

2413
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:12,810
Okay.

2414
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,130
I know my place.

2415
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:15,470
I'm very good at Hella.

2416
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:18,410
I know.

2417
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:19,190
Oh god.

2418
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:19,810
Crow!

2419
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:20,670
Crow!

2420
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:21,490
Crow!

2421
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:23,630
There you go.

2422
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:24,390
We're okay.

2423
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:26,010
Don't worry!

2424
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:27,130
Don't worry Adam!

2425
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:27,530
I got you!

2426
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,130
Executioner!

2427
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:31,050
We're okay.

2428
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:33,310
Penny...

2429
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:34,350
Rise, my friend!

2430
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:35,770
Oh, I'm not hitting anything.

2431
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:37,010
Penny's dead.

2432
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:39,310
And we have rez, so we're okay.

2433
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:39,730
We die.

2434
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:41,390
We're okay.

2435
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:44,010
We're okay.

2436
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:48,470
I'm just a Hella main now.

2437
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:50,870
She's just so good.

2438
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:51,550
Oh!

2439
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:52,570
No!

2440
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,690
Oh my god!

2441
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,530
The moment I swapped to Hella!

2442
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:00,350
Look at that!

2443
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:04,070
I'm f**king shutting people down!

2444
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:05,810
Oh no, it's overtime.

2445
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:08,510
Oh no, not the whale!

2446
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:10,890
Not the whale!

2447
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:13,230
No!

2448
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:15,310
I f**king looked at the wrong way!

2449
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:15,590
I f**king looked at the wrong way!

2450
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,710
I went... I went backwards.

2451
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,910
Whoops.

2452
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:23,790
Hella boi!

2453
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:26,010
Oh, I didn't throw.

2454
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,690
Okay, I thought I was throwing again.

2455
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:29,490
I thought I was throwing again with that.

2456
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:32,070
Okay, I got one.

2457
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,070
No!

2458
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:35,590
No, I'm sky... I'm in!

2459
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,510
No!

2460
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:37,430
We're so...

2461
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:38,810
Is everybody dead?

2462
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:41,330
No!

2463
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,010
No, everybody's dead!

2464
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:43,350
No!

2465
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:44,850
I did so much!

2466
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:46,990
Team, please!

2467
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:49,270
I did so much!

2468
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:49,850
Team!

2469
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,230
No!

2470
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,130
I die and we lose!

2471
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:57,290
I can't believe it!

2472
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:59,470
I got whaled and then we lose!

2473
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:01,990
It's so...

2474
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,970
And then I lost MVP!

2475
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:10,070
Oh my god!

2476
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,360
I lost MVP for that!

2477
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,140
I'm getting my summoner.

2478
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,420
I did so much!

2479
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:21,360
I actually...

2480
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,040
I did so much!

2481
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:24,960
We...

2482
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:27,260
Team was too heavy!

2483
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:30,060
Team was too heavy!

2484
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:36,260
Oh my god!

2485
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:37,800
I'm sad.

2486
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:38,520
We...

2487
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,600
We did so much!

2488
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:42,980
We did so much!

2489
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,060
You'll need a top notch team to win this one.

2490
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,420
I can't believe it.

2491
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,580
I can't fucking believe it.

2492
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:51,240
I'm gonna...

2493
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,780
Alright, this is gonna be a chill game.

2494
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,780
I'm gonna show you guys...

2495
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,820
I'm gonna show you guys the key pop star.

2496
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:01,280
The Scarlet Adventure Delayed the Hella Switch.

2497
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,600
I'll show you guys what I mean when I said Hella.

2498
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:08,080
When I said Luna was basically Juno.

2499
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,040
You have only one healer?

2500
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:11,700
Alright.

2501
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,340
It's time to dance.

2502
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,300
It's time to clap everybody.

2503
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:15,620
It's time to clap everybody.

2504
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,360
She's like an ice...

2505
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,680
An ice wizard who sings too.

2506
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,240
I need to look at her stuff again.

2507
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:24,900
It's been a while.

2508
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:28,680
Her ult is basically dance to heal.

2509
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,540
And then damaging enemies or healing while storing her own health.

2510
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,160
Okay, fire is attached.

2511
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:37,680
Allies will also restore health while Luna's snow is healing others.

2512
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,900
Cast the clump of ice to freeze.

2513
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:41,260
Cast the clump of ice to freeze.

2514
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:42,420
Okay, that freezes people.

2515
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,280
Okay, that freezes people.

2516
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:46,800
Okay.

2517
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:47,760
Watch this.

2518
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,220
So she does this.

2519
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,780
This is literally Juno's run.

2520
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,720
This is literally how Juno runs.

2521
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,080
I don't know.

2522
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:02,000
This is my first time saying it.

2523
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:03,020
Okay.

2524
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:05,160
We'll give her that.

2525
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:08,400
It's okay.

2526
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,460
We have a tank?

2527
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,240
Okay, we're gonna give that to our tank then.

2528
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:15,480
Alright.

2529
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:16,960
It's alright!

2530
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:17,440
I'm healing!

2531
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,060
Because we only have one healer!

2532
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:21,560
Pansy!

2533
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,000
Alright.

2534
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:26,960
We're fine.

2535
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,720
I don't even know if I hit her.

2536
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:32,560
Oh yeah.

2537
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,060
That should be going towards our fucking...

2538
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,180
Oh god.

2539
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:39,780
Let's see.

2540
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,580
I need the tank to have it.

2541
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,580
Because it makes sense.

2542
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,440
This basically gives her passive.

2543
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:47,420
Ooh!

2544
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:49,300
That freeze though!

2545
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:51,640
Don't worry!

2546
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,160
I got you!

2547
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,620
Oh my god!

2548
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:56,320
Where the fuck?

2549
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,600
Where did Spider-Man go?

2550
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,400
He died so fast!

2551
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,100
I gotta make sure I don't die.

2552
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,640
Because I'm literally the only healer.

2553
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,120
That's fucking right!

2554
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,440
Don't attack my fucking team again!

2555
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:13,420
Since we only have one tank, I have to put a Zenado.

2556
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,980
I have to put an Aura Ball on our guy.

2557
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,140
Okay.

2558
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,460
I need to remember...

2559
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:19,140
What was shift again?

2560
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:21,840
Oh!

2561
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,440
Oh yeah!

2562
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,840
This is the clap to heal!

2563
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:24,840
Clap to heal!

2564
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,260
Clap!

2565
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:25,940
Clap!

2566
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:26,520
Clap!

2567
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:30,460
That one was clap to heal.

2568
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,440
No, I wanted to give the thing to our Magneto.

2569
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:34,920
Where's Magneto?

2570
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,360
There you are.

2571
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:38,260
Taco!

2572
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:39,740
Alright.

2573
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:40,860
Ooh!

2574
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,580
Alright, it's almost time to dance, guys.

2575
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,280
It's almost time to dance.

2576
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,160
I'm ready to dance!

2577
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,160
Holy shit!

2578
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,360
I filled my ult so fucking fast, though.

2579
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,940
I just realized.

2580
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,820
I literally took like, less than 30 seconds, I think.

2581
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,100
Sam!

2582
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,040
Clap!

2583
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,800
Clap, clap, clap, clap!

2584
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:03,740
Clap!

2585
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:04,500
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap!

2586
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:04,840
Clap!

2587
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,240
So dumb!

2588
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,800
So dumb.

2589
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,800
Our tank isn't even like up there.

2590
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:15,280
Our tank isn't up there.

2591
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,240
Get healed!

2592
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,920
There's like no point in me ulting.

2593
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:28,300
Alright, I guess we're gonna chill here for a little bit because I don't think...

2594
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,300
Don't make me clap!

2595
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:31,940
Clap!

2596
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:32,460
Clap!

2597
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,020
Clap!

2598
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,400
That's fucking right.

2599
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,560
That's right!

2600
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:39,400
It's dancing time!

2601
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,760
It's dancing time!

2602
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,920
Get healed everybody!

2603
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,840
Get healed!

2604
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:48,600
Okay,

2605
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:54,330
you can heal from that.

2606
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:56,830
You can heal from my fucking nuke.

2607
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:02,930
That's good to know, chat.

2608
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:04,890
That's good to know that...

2609
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:08,950
That you can survive.

2610
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:11,750
Dancing does not save you from...

2611
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,270
From a nuclear bomb.

2612
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:17,230
You know, I needed to learn that now.

2613
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,370
I needed to learn that.

2614
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:23,650
Fuck off!

2615
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:25,170
Clap.

2616
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:28,910
How can dancing not protect you from nukes?

2617
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:30,030
I know, right?

2618
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:31,590
How was I supposed to know?

2619
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:34,450
I thought dancing was gonna save us!

2620
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:36,690
With the power of dance!

2621
01:33:39,150 --> 01:33:40,930
I can't believe it!

2622
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:44,270
Oh no.

2623
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,550
Why does nobody shoot at the top?

2624
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,790
Wait, that's it?

2625
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:52,090
Nobody shot me when I was up there.

2626
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:53,070
I just noticed that.

2627
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:56,310
That's all it took?

2628
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:59,270
Nobody shot me!

2629
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:01,990
Oh no it's time to dance.

2630
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:03,430
Dance!

2631
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:05,310
Dance!

2632
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:05,970
Dance!

2633
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:06,530
Dance!

2634
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:07,090
Dance!

2635
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:15,290
Oh that was fast... gamers don't look up!

2636
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:16,030
That's true.

2637
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:16,030
That's true.

2638
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:17,550
That's so true.

2639
01:34:19,650 --> 01:34:20,170
Nice.

2640
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:23,110
But yeah, that's the...

2641
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:25,350
That was the K-Pop Healer.

2642
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:27,850
Uh... what the...

2643
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:31,410
That was basically the K-Pop Healer.

2644
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:33,770
How much healing did I do?

2645
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:35,870
That's why you guys would not have done any...

2646
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,210
would not have been able to survive without me.

2647
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:37,990
Just remember that.

2648
01:34:40,350 --> 01:34:43,770
Seven... zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, seven thousand.

2649
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:44,810
Yeah, that makes sense.

2650
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:45,490
That...

2651
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:53,010
Their other support had a thousand heals.

2652
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:55,170
Oh my god.

2653
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:58,450
The Rocket Raccoon had a thousand heals.

2654
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:01,330
That's embarrassing, Bing Bong.

2655
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:03,930
I got seven thousand.

2656
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,450
Alright, but I think...

2657
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:10,710
Yeah, that's right.

2658
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:11,770
Upload me.

2659
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:13,750
I think Luna Snow is done.

2660
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:15,090
She's definitely the easiest healer.

2661
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:19,870
Um... the easiest healer in the party ain't no more.

2662
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:24,650
Alright.

2663
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:27,230
I don't wanna play...

2664
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:29,110
Okay, I'll try... I don't know.

2665
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:29,850
I feel like...

2666
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:32,650
Venom is also seems like really difficult too.

2667
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:35,070
I could try Venom.

2668
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:36,410
I could try it.

2669
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:37,670
He has like...

2670
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:41,990
He seems all over the place when I was watching people play it.

2671
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:43,750
Venom's swing.

2672
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:47,450
People who are good at Venom were like crazy.

2673
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:48,890
They were like everywhere.

2674
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:51,210
Generate a bonus health.

2675
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:52,490
Okay, that's the bonus health.

2676
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:55,670
Dash to target... Oh no, I didn't finish reading!

2677
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,570
No, Venom's a tank.

2678
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,010
Um... he's a tank.

2679
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:03,970
Oh shit!

2680
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:04,950
We have team up activated!

2681
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:07,150
Alright.

2682
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:09,490
Let's see.

2683
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:13,430
Dash to target location from a certain height upon landing.

2684
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,830
Damage.

2685
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:16,830
Knocking them back towards the landing point.

2686
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:20,190
Unleash tentacles to slow enemies within reach.

2687
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:21,990
Okay.

2688
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:24,310
Enemies under break free time will suffer your damage.

2689
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:25,670
God, that is so complicated.

2690
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:27,350
Uh... shift.

2691
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:31,810
Dash to target location from a certain height upon landing.

2692
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:33,070
Oh my god!

2693
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,130
Okay, I'm gonna try.

2694
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:36,270
I'm gonna try my best.

2695
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:38,870
I'm gonna try my best.

2696
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:39,990
Alright.

2697
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:42,030
Woo!

2698
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:42,870
Oh!

2699
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:44,030
Shit!

2700
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:44,630
Okay!

2701
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:45,350
Movement.

2702
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:48,370
Okay, I did not expect to be there that fast.

2703
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:50,450
Fucking movement right there.

2704
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:54,930
Holy shit.

2705
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:59,030
Oh my god, I need to be like closer.

2706
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:01,150
No!

2707
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:05,230
I mean, look at my health.

2708
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:07,670
Oh!

2709
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:08,230
Goodbye!

2710
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:09,570
Woo!

2711
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:13,950
Nice.

2712
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,070
Oh shit, guys!

2713
01:37:16,150 --> 01:37:18,290
I forgot my thing loses HP!

2714
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:19,290
Guys!

2715
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:20,590
Come to heal me!

2716
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:25,490
That's fucking right.

2717
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:28,110
What the fuck you just read?

2718
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:31,890
You think you can run from me?

2719
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:34,590
Guys, I'm not very good at tank, guys.

2720
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:37,190
I don't think I'm a fan.

2721
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:38,850
Get over here!

2722
01:37:39,950 --> 01:37:40,510
Oh!

2723
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:41,450
Oh god.

2724
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:42,210
Okay, guys.

2725
01:37:42,210 --> 01:37:43,510
I'm not very good at tank, guys.

2726
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:43,990
I'm...

2727
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:48,670
That's fucking right!

2728
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:49,870
That's right!

2729
01:37:49,950 --> 01:37:50,470
Get over here!

2730
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:51,850
I'll fucking brawl with you!

2731
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:52,430
Oh!

2732
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:53,870
Don't brawl!

2733
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:54,550
Don't brawl!

2734
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,390
I'm stuck!

2735
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:56,630
I'm stuck!

2736
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:58,850
Guys!

2737
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,250
Guys!

2738
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:01,870
Use my heals!

2739
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:04,230
You take request assistance!

2740
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:05,870
Clap!

2741
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:10,550
Clap!

2742
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,610
Clap!

2743
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:12,250
Right now!

2744
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:14,370
Keep clapping!

2745
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:17,410
It's very important you keep clapping!

2746
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:20,970
Keep clapping!

2747
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:21,870
Keep clapping!

2748
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:22,950
Okay.

2749
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:25,010
I fucked up.

2750
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:27,370
That was not what I wanted to do, but that's okay.

2751
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:29,290
Oh god.

2752
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:30,990
I need to run.

2753
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:32,450
Where's my claps?

2754
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:34,150
Where's my claps?

2755
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:38,270
Oh shit!

2756
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:39,850
I gotta go over there!

2757
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:41,830
Gotta go over there!

2758
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:42,490
Get the heals!

2759
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:43,070
Okay.

2760
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:43,590
Nice.

2761
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,710
Okay.

2762
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:45,390
That's good.

2763
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:46,710
I got the claps.

2764
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:48,070
Oh!

2765
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:51,850
What is going on?

2766
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:55,430
What the fuck is going on?

2767
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:56,970
I'm trying to survive!

2768
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:01,350
I'm trying to survive!

2769
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:01,430
Please!

2770
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:03,250
Where's...

2771
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:04,330
Where's claps?

2772
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:05,710
No!

2773
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:10,510
Oh my...

2774
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:12,950
How the fuck do you play Venom?

2775
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:13,770
I...

2776
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:14,770
I don't know!

2777
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:17,270
How to play Venom!

2778
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:19,590
It's so fucking difficult!

2779
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:21,990
Jesus Christ!

2780
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:23,310
Okay.

2781
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:25,390
Alright.

2782
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:26,450
We're okay.

2783
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:29,430
Do we have two healers?

2784
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:30,530
We have one healer.

2785
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:30,930
Okay.

2786
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:32,090
That makes more sense guys.

2787
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:34,350
We literally have one support.

2788
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:35,270
Anyway.

2789
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:40,170
Oh my god.

2790
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:43,170
Guys, I think we need another support.

2791
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:47,070
Guys, I think we need another support.

2792
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:47,190
Please clap.

2793
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:48,010
Please clap.

2794
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:49,670
I'm never saying clap because...

2795
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:51,330
We need another healer!

2796
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:52,770
Please.

2797
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:52,850
Please.

2798
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:56,490
Clapping is not enough.

2799
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:03,230
Guys, we need more.

2800
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:06,390
Oh, we did it!

2801
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:08,670
Oh, it's because the...

2802
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:10,550
The Luna...

2803
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:12,570
The other healer...

2804
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:14,390
The Luna Snow...

2805
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:17,050
She claps to heal.

2806
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:18,810
She...

2807
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:20,250
Her ability...

2808
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:23,130
One of her abilities is that whenever she claps, she heals you.

2809
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:27,430
Alright.

2810
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:27,990
We're fine.

2811
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:33,210
With the amount of shipping and clapping that's going on, Marble Rivals will have a population boomerang.

2812
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:34,070
A couple of years.

2813
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:36,450
You know what's going to make Marble Rivals blow up?

2814
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:38,570
If those 3D models become public.

2815
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,090
All you need to do is...

2816
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:44,070
Guys...

2817
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:46,150
Honestly...

2818
01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:47,210
True.

2819
01:40:50,190 --> 01:40:53,210
That's the only way Marble Rivals will survive.

2820
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:55,230
Will become popular.

2821
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,790
Let me help you.

2822
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:02,310
What the fuck?

2823
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:03,670
Come around.

2824
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:06,470
Oh, god.

2825
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:12,090
That's fucking right.

2826
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:12,390
Clap!

2827
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:13,530
Clap!

2828
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:14,470
Clap!

2829
01:41:14,690 --> 01:41:17,170
I'm fucking gonna kill you, you little raccoon!

2830
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:18,990
Get over here!

2831
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:20,950
You think you can run from me?

2832
01:41:22,710 --> 01:41:23,990
Holy sh...

2833
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:26,450
What the...

2834
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:27,410
Fuck?

2835
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:30,270
What is going on?

2836
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:33,650
Guys, I think everybody is dead.

2837
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,510
Every time I'm not DPSed, guys...

2838
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:37,130
I think...

2839
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,270
Every time I'm not...

2840
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:41,850
You wanna fucking do this?

2841
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:42,990
You wanna do this?

2842
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:44,430
You wanna do this?

2843
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:45,910
That's fucking right.

2844
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:51,610
Every time I'm not DPSed...

2845
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:54,170
I think I was...

2846
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:55,390
Carrying, guys.

2847
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:59,210
Yeah!

2848
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:00,210
Devour!

2849
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:01,950
Oh my god!

2850
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,810
Somebody clap for me right now!

2851
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:11,230
Oh my god!

2852
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:13,610
I'm on it!

2853
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:13,950
I'm on it!

2854
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:17,630
Oh god, please!

2855
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:18,990
Oh, please!

2856
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:22,190
Please, there's so many things on me!

2857
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:23,270
Please, there's so many things on me!

2858
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:23,450
Please, there's so many things on me!

2859
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:23,630
Oh!

2860
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:29,390
I killed somebody!

2861
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:30,610
I killed somebody!

2862
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:31,450
I'm not...

2863
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:32,470
I was confused.

2864
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:33,650
Who did I kill?

2865
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:35,410
Oh, I crushed her!

2866
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:37,490
I crushed her!

2867
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:37,890
Okay.

2868
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:39,330
Okay.

2869
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:42,790
I fucking crushed the shit out of that one...

2870
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:43,410
I don't know how!

2871
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:44,450
I...

2872
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:45,490
I...

2873
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,610
Okay, to be fair, I did kill her...

2874
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:51,010
Before... Okay, guys.

2875
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:52,910
I did kill her, guys.

2876
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,530
Oh my god!

2877
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:56,950
Alright!

2878
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:58,630
I'm out.

2879
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:00,110
I'm out.

2880
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:02,850
Oh, I'm not out.

2881
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,530
I'm not out.

2882
01:43:04,530 --> 01:43:04,970
I'm not out.

2883
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:09,990
I don't know how fucking disoriented I'm playing Venom!

2884
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,590
He's so dis...

2885
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:13,710
He's so fucking...

2886
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:14,970
Alright.

2887
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:17,790
Alright, there you go.

2888
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:18,370
It's okay.

2889
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:19,070
I'm getting...

2890
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:20,310
I'm slowly learning.

2891
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:24,190
I got somebody down with me!

2892
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:24,810
Okay, guys?

2893
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:26,850
That's like a win on my book.

2894
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:30,210
Here we go.

2895
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:33,290
Here we go.

2896
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:34,210
Here we go.

2897
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:34,870
Oh, no!

2898
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:36,930
Wait.

2899
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:37,830
Where are they?

2900
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:40,970
Where... Where are the people?

2901
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:43,270
There you go.

2902
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:45,950
I... I...

2903
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:46,750
I don't know.

2904
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:48,490
They're all just...

2905
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:49,170
They're everywhere!

2906
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:55,290
Why are they everywhere?!

2907
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:55,550
Why are they everywhere?!

2908
01:43:56,850 --> 01:43:57,410
Get over here!

2909
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:59,310

2910
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:00,390

2911
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,850
Goodbye.

2912
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:02,710
Goodbye.

2913
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:05,590
They're like, literally everywhere.

2914
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:06,830
I don't know what to do sometimes.

2915
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:11,530
Woo!

2916
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,090
Alright.

2917
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:12,770
Whoops.

2918
01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:15,590
Where are they?

2919
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:16,590
Oh, shit.

2920
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:16,990
There you are.

2921
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:20,790
Where is that?

Get over here!

2923
01:44:22,690 --> 01:44:23,730
Where are you?

01:44:24,410 --> 01:44:24,970
No!

2925
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:26,570
You don't shoot them!

2926
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:28,610
I'll beat the shit out of you!

2927
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:30,810
Get over here!

2928
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:32,310

Okay.

2934
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:47,370
There you are.

2935
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:51,210
I did it!

2936
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:52,810
I figured it out!

2937
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:55,350
I figured out how to play Venom!

2938
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:56,830
I did it!

2939
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:56,830

2940
01:44:57,890 --> 01:44:59,370

01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:05,370
No, I just run!

2944
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:06,270
This works!

2945
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:08,010
What were you gonna say?

2946
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:09,550
Did you see that?

2947
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:11,290
I ate that whole tree!

2948
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:13,270
Did you guys see that?

2949
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:15,070

This guy is hard to play!

2954
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:28,890

01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:31,550
I fucking solo altered the tree!

01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:34,230
I was like, fuck that tree in particular!

2958
01:45:35,010 --> 01:45:37,630
There is great chaos in you...

2959

Oh my god!

2960
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:45,750

01:45:45,870 --> 01:45:48,390
Because it's like I'm solo tanky now.

2997
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:03,470
I'm gonna wait a little bit.

2998
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:04,330
I don't wanna go up yet.

2999
01:47:04,450 --> 01:47:05,250
I need heal though.

3000
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:06,070
Where's... nice.

3001
01:47:06,710 --> 01:47:07,150
Okay.

3002
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:07,730
He snaps.

3003
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:13,910
That's fucking right.

3004
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:14,610
Where are you?

3005
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:15,790
Where are you?

3006
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:17,390
Where are you?

3007
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:21,390
Holy shit!

3008
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:22,310
Where are they?

3009
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,590
I'm just like...

3010
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:25,870
Oh that's a lot.

3011
01:47:28,870 --> 01:47:30,110
Just keep snapping!

3012
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:33,930
Just keep snapping!

3013
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:35,790
Just keep snapping!

3014
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:36,070
Oh!

3015
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:37,170
Shit!

3016
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:37,390
Okay.

3017
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:38,190
Okay it's fine.

3018
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:38,530
We're fine.

3019
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:38,850
We're fine.

3020
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:39,090
We're fine.

3021
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:39,530
He snapped.

3022
01:47:40,230 --> 01:47:40,990
He snapped.

3023
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:42,370
He snapped enough.

3024
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:43,950
Okay.

3025
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:44,590
I got...

3026
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:45,150
I got Groot.

3027
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:46,890
I got Groot.

3028
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:49,210
Okay.

3029
01:47:49,570 --> 01:47:50,970
It's time to eat somebody!

3030
01:47:52,170 --> 01:47:55,150
Om nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!

3031
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:56,230
No!

3032
01:47:56,370 --> 01:47:57,390
You're out of my way.

3033
01:47:59,190 --> 01:47:59,670
Alright.

3034
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:00,690
Nice, we're fine.

3035
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:01,610
We're fine.

3036
01:48:02,110 --> 01:48:04,350
I couldn't eat trees this time, but...

3037
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:05,750
Where did he go?

3038
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:07,290
Where did he go?

3039
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:11,770
Okay, we gotta wait, we gotta wait.

3040
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:16,990
Boom!

3041
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:18,630
That's fucking right!

3042
01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:20,090
Get over here, Groot!

3043
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:21,370
Get over here!

3044
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:22,710
Oh, goodbye, Groot!

3045
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:23,370
Goodbye!

3046
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:26,410
I had enough trees!

3047
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:27,290
JK!

3048
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:28,430
Oh, I have enough trees!

3049
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:34,390
Oh no, I got too much damage!

3050
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:36,690
I thought I was getting healed!

3051
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:40,010
I thought I was getting healed, guys!

3052
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:42,510
But I wasn't!

3053
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:44,630
Alright, we'll wait.

3054
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:48,130
We're in obsession with the tree.

3055
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:49,850
He fucking deserved it.

3056
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:51,990
No, Star-Lord!

3057
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:53,390
Are we soulbounded?

3058
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:54,730
Who's my best friend?

3059
01:48:55,570 --> 01:48:57,190
Somebody's my best friend, but I don't know who.

3060
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:01,290
Okay, we gotta wait, we gotta wait, we gotta wait, we gotta wait.

3061
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:03,010
Guys, we gotta wait.

3062
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:05,510
Oh, what is that?

3063
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:07,750
Oh no, it's the fucking panther.

3064
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:10,190
It's okay.

3065
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:11,270
Where did he go?

3066
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:12,370
Where did he go?

3067
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:15,030
There's too many things on the screen!

3068
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:17,850
Get away!

3069
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:19,430
Get away!

3070
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:20,230
We need the support!

3071
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:21,770
Okay, are we good?

3072
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:22,530
Alright.

3073
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:24,590
Alright, I'm gonna go up.

3074
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:27,690
It's okay.

3075
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:28,910
We're fine.

3076
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:31,330
I'm fucking...

3077
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:31,910
I'm trying to...

3078
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:33,090
Oh, shit!

3079
01:49:33,730 --> 01:49:34,550
Oh, god.

3080
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:35,490
Please.

3081
01:49:35,770 --> 01:49:36,690
I need heals.

3082
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:37,770
Guys, no!

3083
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:39,110
Look out!

3084
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:40,750
I needed heals!

3085
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:43,250
My teeth...

3086
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:44,930
I needed more snaps!

3087
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:48,990
Holy shit, what is that man sense?

3088
01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:52,670
Oh, no, guys.

3089
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:53,730
Regroup!

3090
01:49:54,210 --> 01:49:54,850
Guys!

3091
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,230
Regroup, guys!

3092
01:49:57,530 --> 01:49:59,170
We have one fight!

3093
01:49:59,550 --> 01:49:59,890
We got it!

3094
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:00,930
We got away!

3095
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:01,710
Guys!

3096
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:04,250
Mantis, I swear to god, don't you dare.

3097
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:05,170
We have to wait.

3098
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:07,210
We have to wait, guys.

3099
01:50:07,490 --> 01:50:08,870
Mantis, look at me!

3100
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:13,250
Oh no, I pressed the wrong button.

3101
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:15,190
Okay, I think I'm gonna go in.

3102
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:15,710
I'm gonna go in.

3103
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:16,970
Just keep me up.

3104
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:17,710
Just keep me up.

3105
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:20,090
Okay.

3106
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:25,330
Guys, I would... guys...

3107
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:29,890
As like the only tank here...

3108
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:33,150
I don't...

3109
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:36,530
This is just DPS dip to be honest.

3110
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:39,190
I don't think it was a me issue.

3111
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:41,930
I... I did my job.

3112
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:43,270
I... I...

3113
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:45,930
I literally did my job.

3114
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:47,530
I... I...

3115
01:50:47,530 --> 01:50:49,170
I ate trees.

3116
01:50:49,530 --> 01:50:51,690
Come on, what do you want me to do?

3117
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:56,190
I blocked 22,000 damage.

3118
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:59,570
I... I blocked a lot.

3119
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:04,470
I did what I was supposed to do as a tank.

3120
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:05,350
Like...

3121
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:06,290
...

3122
01:51:10,370 --> 01:51:10,890
...

3123
01:51:13,950 --> 01:51:16,590
Venom is gonna turn so many people into tank players.

3124
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:20,810
The thing is, the only issue with Venom is that it's so hard to like...

3125
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:24,970
It's so hard to play him when you don't have heals.

3126
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:25,990
...

3127
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:30,110
Because he's bouncing around.

3128
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:32,350
I feel like you need to know where the health packs are.

3129
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:34,010
When you play Venom.

3130
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:35,050
Alright.

3131
01:51:35,650 --> 01:51:36,410
Uhhh...

3132
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,110
You know what?

3133
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:40,990
Let's try Iron Man.

3134
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:42,090
I wanna try Iron Man.

3135
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:44,710
What's his abilities?

3136
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:49,170
Okay, activate hyper velocity state.

3137
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:55,810
Activate armor overdrive enhancing damage when...

3138
01:51:57,090 --> 01:52:00,130
Hyper velocity or armor overdrive is... Wait, what?

3139
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:02,390
What was the last statement?

3140
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:07,750
Alright.

3141
01:52:09,950 --> 01:52:10,550
Uhhh...

3142
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:10,610
...

3143
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:17,350
When hyper velocity armor is used, Iron Man can launch a bombardment.

3144
01:52:17,410 --> 01:52:17,650
Okay.

3145
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:19,170
I'm gonna use...

3146
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,470
When I fly, I can launch missiles.

3147
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:22,770
Okay.

3148
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:24,490
And then...

3149
01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:26,170
Okay, so...

3150
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:28,410
If I have...

3151
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:33,270
Do I damage a repulsor blast or a uni beam?

3152
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:33,910
Oh, okay.

3153
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:35,610
That makes the...

3154
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:36,770
my attacks stronger.

3155
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:38,590
And then... Okay!

3156
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:40,550
Okay, I'm gonna try and remember that.

3157
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:42,350
So...

3158
01:52:43,130 --> 01:52:45,190
So this would...

3159
01:52:46,690 --> 01:52:47,250
...

3160
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:50,810
Whoa!

3161
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:51,850
I'm still flying!

3162
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:52,670
I...

3163
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:54,390
Okay.

3164
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:56,870
Alright.

3165
01:52:57,050 --> 01:52:58,650
This is... That's right.

3166
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:00,410
Yeah, that's right.

3167
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:04,010
That's fucking right.

3168
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:04,590
Get over here.

3169
01:53:05,890 --> 01:53:07,010
This will...

3170
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:08,990
Oh my god.

3171
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:10,030
What the fuck?!

3172
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:11,110
What is he do?

3173
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:11,670
What?

3174
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:12,170
What?

3175
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:14,110
He fucking deactivated me!

3176
01:53:15,550 --> 01:53:16,850
He uses radiation!

3177
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:20,730
That's fucked up!

3178
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:25,350
He literally uses radiation for that!

3179
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:29,570
Okay, Iron Man sucks.

3180
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:30,350
I hate Iron Man.

3181
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:35,210
What's my ult trying?

3182
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:39,210
I'm gonna try and get the... I'm gonna try and get an ult.

3183
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:42,210
Literally the only fun thing is this ult.

3184
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:46,990
I don't like... like... I don't like the...

3185
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:49,930
Wait, how do I... Oh, I have to hold it.

3186
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,850
Oh, this is the tracker.

3187
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:55,990
Okay, never mind.

3188
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:56,950
He's pretty fun now.

3189
01:53:57,170 --> 01:53:57,950
Never mind.

3190
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:59,230
I like it.

3191
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:01,270
Oh, fuck.

3192
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:02,130
Yo, fuck.

3193
01:54:02,550 --> 01:54:03,230
Never mind.

3194
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:03,810
This is easy.

3195
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:08,250
Never mind.

3196
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:09,550
This is easy.

3197
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:12,170
This is easy.

3198
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:21,370
As long as I just have the track, I'm fine.

3199
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:25,730
No.

3200
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:27,810
You think you can get away?

3201
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:29,110
That's fucking right.

3202
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:29,210
Oh, fuck.

3203
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:29,890
I can track.

3204
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:31,670
I can track.

3205
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:32,650
That's fucking...

3206
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:33,650
That's not fair!

3207
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:36,390
He's just fucking...

3208
01:54:37,090 --> 01:54:37,790
Oh, what the fuck?

3209
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:39,010
Oh, shit.

3210
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,670
What?

3211
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:47,490
Never mind.

3212
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:50,750
The moment I found out I can track, it's over.

3213
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:52,890
It's fucking over.

3214
01:54:53,130 --> 01:54:54,190
I figured it out.

3215
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:56,410
I figured it out.

3216
01:54:59,390 --> 01:55:00,910
It's a Zarya tracking.

3217
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:01,730
I can track.

3218
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:04,010
Alright, I'm gonna waste my ult.

3219
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:07,270
JK, I wanna fucking kill this guy though.

3220
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:09,390
That's right.

3221
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:10,150
Don't get healed.

3222
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:11,650
You know what?

3223
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:13,610
Should I...

3224
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:14,510
I was gonna say...

3225
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:17,870
What the fuck?

3226
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:20,330
Alright, I need like a...

3227
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:21,210
Okay.

3228
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:23,370
Maximum pulse!

3229
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:24,730
Yeah!

3230
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:26,590
Shit!

3231
01:55:26,590 --> 01:55:28,990
Holy shit!

3232
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:32,630
That shit is so fucking broken.

3233
01:55:32,990 --> 01:55:34,170
That was worth it.

3234
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:36,370
That was worth it.

3235
01:55:37,370 --> 01:55:39,690
We lost, but like...

3236
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:41,430
That was worth it though.

3237
01:55:46,850 --> 01:55:48,870
I figured out how to ult.

3238
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:50,350
Alright, let's see.

3239
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:52,150
We have two supports.

3240
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:53,450
Alright, it's time.

3241
01:55:53,570 --> 01:55:55,150
It's time to win this for the team.

3242
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:56,150
It's...

3243
01:55:58,310 --> 01:55:59,630
Totally worth it.

3244
01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:01,910
Alright, it's time for my team to win.

3245
01:56:03,490 --> 01:56:05,710
I lost, but I got a taste of power.

3246
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:06,730
That shit is crazy.

3247
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:08,510
I don't remember what his ult was.

3248
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:10,610
His ult was like a beam or something.

3249
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:11,070
I remembered.

3250
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:12,750
I'm pretty sure.

3251
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:15,410
Alright, I think we unlocked rank apparently.

3252
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:17,330
So after this, we'll go into rank.

3253
01:56:19,590 --> 01:56:21,650
Time for my meta pick.

3254
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:24,790
I remember his ult was not like that.

3255
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:25,130
I remember his ult was not like that.

3256
01:56:25,990 --> 01:56:26,430
Yeah.

3257
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:28,650
Well, his right click is good.

3258
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:30,450
I think his right click is really good.

3259
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:31,930
If you can aim.

3260
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:35,530
It was the uni beam.

3261
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:36,770
The uni beam is fun.

3262
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:39,110
I didn't like his... I don't like his left click.

3263
01:56:39,170 --> 01:56:40,570
But his uni beam is really good.

3264
01:56:42,710 --> 01:56:44,030
Alright, let's see.

3265
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:46,910
Now it's time to carry this team.

3266
01:56:51,070 --> 01:56:52,650
Oh, hope I can find people.

3267
01:56:54,710 --> 01:56:55,310
Okay.

3268
01:56:55,770 --> 01:56:56,370
How?

3269
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:57,210
How?

3270
01:56:57,630 --> 01:56:58,230
How?

3271
01:57:00,650 --> 01:57:01,250
Guys!

3272
01:57:01,570 --> 01:57:03,210
I have not played a...

3273
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:05,390
Okay.

3274
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:06,750
Now...

3275
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:14,290
I don't know what happened to me guys.

3276
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:15,730
Guys, I don't...

3277
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:18,250
I don't know what happened to me.

3278
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:19,510
What happened to me?

3279
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:21,970
What happened to me?

3280
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:26,950
Oh my god.

3281
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:30,670
I went highest to be queen of the world.

3282
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:31,890
I...

3283
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:33,870
I don't know what happened.

3284
01:57:34,190 --> 01:57:35,330
It just...

3285
01:57:35,330 --> 01:57:38,130
I just couldn't aim anymore.

3286
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:39,490
I don't...

3287
01:57:39,490 --> 01:57:41,230
I don't know what happened.

3288
01:57:43,670 --> 01:57:44,750
It just...

3289
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:46,470
It just stopped working.

3290
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:49,410
What's that?

3291
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:50,710
I don't remember what that sound was.

3292
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:55,970
Maybe they hot fixed it guys.

3293
01:57:56,090 --> 01:57:56,630
Maybe they hot fixed it guys.

3294
01:57:56,630 --> 01:57:57,670
I know what they did.

3295
01:57:57,830 --> 01:58:00,190
They like hot fixed it so like...

3296
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:04,670
They like hot fixed it so like...

3297
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:05,770
Wait, no I'm lagging.

3298
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:09,410
Wait, am I lagging or are they lagging?

3299
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:10,670
Wait, am I lagging or are they lagging?

3300
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:12,030
Guys, guys, I think...

3301
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:13,550
Guys, it's because I'm lagging guys.

3302
01:58:13,870 --> 01:58:14,810
It's not...

3303
01:58:16,350 --> 01:58:18,290
Guys, I think I'm actually lagging.

3304
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:20,490
Oh my god, actual lag!

3305
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:21,030
Oh my god, actual lag!

3306
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:23,950
Hahahaha!

3307
01:58:25,570 --> 01:58:26,250
Wait!

3308
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:28,370
Actually...

3309
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:28,490
No!

3310
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:34,810
Oh my god, thank god it was actually lagged.

3311
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:37,810
Oh my god, thank god it's actually lagged.

3312
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:38,310
Hahaha.

3313
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:44,730
Oh my god, thank god.

3314
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:45,610
I knew it.

3315
01:58:45,710 --> 01:58:49,030
I knew I was... my aim was still good.

3316
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:51,210
I knew it.

3317
01:58:52,650 --> 01:58:53,770
I fucking knew it.

3318
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:55,010
I'm just lagging guys.

3319
01:58:55,110 --> 01:58:56,030
We figured it out.

3320
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:58,350
SEE?

3321
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:02,410
I know my aim.

3322
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:06,970
What is that?

3323
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:08,410
OH FUCK!

3324
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:10,550
I thought I had a healer next to me!

3325
01:59:11,130 --> 01:59:14,710
I'm happy for lag.

3326
01:59:14,910 --> 01:59:19,130
The only reason I'm happy for lag is because my aim is still there.

3327
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:25,250
Oh my god, thank god.

3328
01:59:25,410 --> 01:59:26,190
It's not me.

3329
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:28,330
It's not me.

3330
01:59:29,730 --> 01:59:31,910
Also, I have really dog shit healers.

3331
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:34,830
This is the only reason why I like playing support.

3332
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:38,970
It's because like, when your healers are dog shit and you have to like...

3333
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:40,910
SEE?

3334
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:42,550
Look, nobody looks up!

3335
01:59:43,390 --> 01:59:44,550
Oh, there he is!

3336
01:59:44,690 --> 01:59:47,870
Is he look- there he- there he goes!

3337
01:59:48,710 --> 01:59:49,830
There he goes!

3338
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:52,070
Nobody looks up!

3339
01:59:53,270 --> 01:59:56,630
Alright, this is literally the only reason why I play support.

3340
01:59:57,030 --> 02:00:02,270
Because like, it's so tilting having bad support players that you have to support yourself.

3341
02:00:06,870 --> 02:00:10,650
Alright, let us... That guy was a really good hulk though.

3342
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:14,510
LordVenn was actually really good as hulk.

3343
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:16,270
Alright, let's go play rank.

3344
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:18,170
How do I- Alright.

3345
02:00:21,290 --> 02:00:22,610
Wait, no it's not.

3346
02:00:22,610 --> 02:00:24,370
I unlocked it!

3347
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:26,550
Know I don't want to fill it.

3348
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:27,490
Woah!

3349
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:29,070
I got so many stuff- wait!

3350
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:30,010
I got lied to!

3351
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:33,190
It opens on the 24th!

3352
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:35,010
It opens tomorrow!

3353
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:38,750
You guys lied to me!

3354
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:42,710
Alright, maybe this time, guys, maybe this time we can do a conquest.

3355
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:43,730
Yeah.

3356
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:47,170
You were like, oh you can unlock rank now and I was like yay!

3357
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:55,430
I got baited so hard.

3358
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:58,450
Like, oh now you can play Ranked.

3359
02:00:58,450 --> 02:00:59,170
I'm like, really?

3360
02:01:00,130 --> 02:01:03,610
Alright, now that I've learned how to play this game...

3361
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:07,430
Ranked is... Conquest is nothing now.

3362
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:11,650
Conquest will be so easy.

3363
02:01:19,970 --> 02:01:21,930
We got this guys, we got this.

3364
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:29,780
Alright, here we go.

3365
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:32,800
Is no one playing Conquest?

3366
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:33,960
Okay, nobody's playing Conquest.

3367
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,220
Maybe Conquest is a bad game.

3368
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:35,840
Okay, nevermind.

3369
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,340
Haha, it's a bad game!

3370
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:41,240
Guys, I think Conquest might be a bad game mode and nobody's on it.

3371
02:01:46,780 --> 02:01:48,700
Nobody's... Okay, I found a match already.

3372
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:49,180
Alright.

3373
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:50,300
Nice.

3374
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:52,960
Yeah.

3375
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:05,480
How is Conquest and... Oh my god, it's the Spider-Man, guys.

3376
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:07,900
Holy shit.

3377
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:09,400
I'm now...

3378
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,440
I'm now an...

3379
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:12,020
I'm now an Adam main.

3380
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:15,180
Friendship ended with Loki.

3381
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:17,920
Adam is now my new best friend.

3382
02:02:20,380 --> 02:02:21,220
It's him!

3383
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:23,880
It's the real Spider-Man!

3384
02:02:25,990 --> 02:02:29,280
It's not my fault they fucking butchered the shit out of Loki.

3385
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:31,740
He's literally dog shit now.

3386
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:37,080
Loki is so... The heals for Loki is just so bad.

3387
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:38,140
Like...

3388
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:39,120
He's so...

3389
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:42,560
Until Adam gets nerfed.

3390
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:43,740
Yeah, until Adam gets nerfed.

3391
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:45,420
He's my new best friend.

3392
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:48,760
I like it when I snap the heal.

3393
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:54,180
Loki is... No, Loki's not even that.

3394
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:55,160
Where is he going?

3395
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:56,000
What?

3396
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:57,420
I like got confused.

3397
02:02:57,980 --> 02:02:59,580
Nobody knows how to walk there.

3398
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:01,900
Nobody's following me.

3399
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:02,880
Nobody knows.

3400
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:06,040
Guys, it's not... Guys, it's not that way.

3401
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:06,760
Haha!

3402
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:07,420
Haha!

3403
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:08,440
Everybody's confused!

3404
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:13,120
You can see everybody doesn't know how to get there.

3405
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:18,900
We were all like, where do we go?

3406
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:20,520
Snap.

3407
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:22,640
So bonded!

3408
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:30,560
Okay.

3409
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,120
Snap.

3410
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:33,340
I love snapping to heal.

3411
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,680
It's so fun.

3412
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:36,460
Oh my god.

3413
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:39,280
Snap!

3414
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:40,060
Snap!

3415
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:40,580
Snap!

3416
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,200
I can't snap anymore!

3417
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:42,740
I'm sorry!

3418
02:03:43,540 --> 02:03:44,920
Somebody help me!

3419
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:48,780
I couldn't!

3420
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:50,200
Scarlet, you just...

3421
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:52,640
What are you doing, Scarlet?

3422
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:55,600
Guys, I don't think Scarlet's a good player.

3423
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:04,020
She literally was just watching us get shot at.

3424
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:07,000
That's so fucked up!

3425
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:09,720
Snap.

3426
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:12,400
Oh god.

3427
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,920
People are learning how to play this game now.

3428
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:14,800
Oh god.

3429
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:16,340
Oh god.

3430
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:16,980
Guys!

3431
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:19,760
Scarlet!

3432
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:23,000
I don't live my dream!

3433
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:25,060
Guys, I need more heals.

3434
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:25,680
This team.

3435
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:28,640
I have a DC?!

3436
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:30,560
How?!

3437
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:34,660
How do I have a DC?!

3438
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:35,500
This is a quick play!

3439
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:37,200
Oh god!

3440
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:38,280
You DC!

3441
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,480
Where's the fill?!

3442
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:43,980
Oh, there's the fill.

3443
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,320
Guys, it's time to clap.

3444
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:49,740
Oh god.

3445
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:51,640
God.

3446
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:54,660
I'm trying my best right now.

3447
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:58,360
Get away from me!

3448
02:04:58,940 --> 02:05:00,440
Get away from me!

3449
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:03,080
Get away!

3450
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:06,000
Oh god.

3451
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:06,580
We have tanks.

3452
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:07,700
Holy shit.

3453
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:09,240
Thank god.

3454
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,760
You have to play Luna Snow for consistent heals.

3455
02:05:15,320 --> 02:05:16,320
I'm pretty sure.

3456
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:18,340
Get away!

3457
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:23,180
I have to play him.

3458
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:26,520
I have to play her so that I can keep the team up.

3459
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:30,360
Get away!

3460
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,320
Freeze!

3461
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:33,120
Get away!

3462
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:36,920
Oh!

3463
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:37,620
Guys!

3464
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:39,520
Clap!

3465
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:40,020
Clap!

3466
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:40,580
God,

3467
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:47,930
Spiderman's the flank killer.

3468
02:05:48,070 --> 02:05:48,750
It's so scary.

3469
02:05:49,850 --> 02:05:50,650
Clap.

3470
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:51,330
Clap.

3471
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:52,870
I'm trying my best to clap.

3472
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:55,450
I'm clapping so hard.

3473
02:05:56,410 --> 02:05:57,210
Behold!

3474
02:05:57,330 --> 02:05:58,210
Dark Child!

3475
02:05:58,650 --> 02:05:59,310
Don't worry!

3476
02:06:00,050 --> 02:06:01,330
We're dancing!

3477
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:03,390
We dance!

3478
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:05,890
We keep dancing!

3479
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:09,550
I can't dance forever!

3480
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:11,430
Magneto!

3481
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:14,310
I can't dance forever!

3482
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:15,410
Magneto!

3483
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:16,730
Please!

3484
02:06:18,410 --> 02:06:19,370
Guys!

3485
02:06:19,470 --> 02:06:20,050
Stop!

3486
02:06:20,650 --> 02:06:22,130
I can't!

3487
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:23,930
Guys, please!

3488
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:24,850
Stop!

3489
02:06:27,630 --> 02:06:30,950
I'm just getting fucked over by the spiders!

3490
02:06:31,610 --> 02:06:33,410
I'm just getting fucked over by the spiders!

3491
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:35,730
I'm just getting fucked over by the spiders!

3492
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:37,330
I think this is GG's.

3493
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:38,810
My team is bad.

3494
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:46,410
I have a feeling my team is bad, guys.

3495
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:52,010
Why is she just standing there?

3496
02:06:52,690 --> 02:06:53,330
Why?

3497
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:57,710
Please!

3498
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:00,150
Are you lagging?

3499
02:07:00,190 --> 02:07:03,370
Why are you just standing there?

3500
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:07,950
Why are you on the DPS line?

3501
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:09,410
Why are you on the DPS line?

3502
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:10,610
And we are just getting...

3503
02:07:10,610 --> 02:07:12,490
And we are just getting...

3504
02:07:12,490 --> 02:07:13,850
Oh my god!

3505
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:18,770
Oh my god!

3506
02:07:18,850 --> 02:07:19,170
Oh my god!

3507
02:07:21,950 --> 02:07:22,990
Holy shit!

3508
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:23,970
Holy shit!

3509
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:25,870
Somebody get her off!

3510
02:07:26,110 --> 02:07:26,130
Somebody get her off!

3511
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:29,170
Oh god!

3512
02:07:29,210 --> 02:07:29,550
Thank god!

3513
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:32,550
Oh thank god!

3514
02:07:33,370 --> 02:07:34,170
Thank god!

3515
02:07:34,870 --> 02:07:35,590
Please!

3516
02:07:35,790 --> 02:07:37,470
Get him away from me!

3517
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:39,490
Oh my god!

3518
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:42,070
Oh my god!

3519
02:07:42,070 --> 02:07:42,670
Scarlet, please!

3520
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:44,030
Wake up!

3521
02:07:44,330 --> 02:07:45,050
Scarlet!

3522
02:07:47,930 --> 02:07:50,190
Wake the fuck up!

3523
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:55,200
Wake the fuck up!

3524
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:58,420
Get away!

3525
02:07:58,820 --> 02:07:59,500
Get away!

3526
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:00,960
I will clap!

3527
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:03,260
And I won't regret it!

3528
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:03,600
And I won't regret it!

3529
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:06,020
Okay.

3530
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:07,800
This...

3531
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,980
This is so difficult.

3532
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,240
Please!

3533
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:15,140
This team...

3534
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:17,400
This fucking team...

3535
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:18,420
Please!

3536
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:21,220
I like the coins.

3537
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:22,400
Please!

3538
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:24,500
This fucking team!

3539
02:08:24,860 --> 02:08:27,540
I will dance if I have to!

3540
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:34,340
Please, live!

3541
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:36,300
I will dance if I have to!

3542
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:38,380
Oh, I missed...

3543
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:39,300
I missed the thing.

3544
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:40,480
Okay.

3545
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,840
He's low though.

3546
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:42,280
He's low.

3547
02:08:43,940 --> 02:08:44,580
I'll clap!

3548
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:45,120
Clap!

3549
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:45,580
Clap!

3550
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:45,980
Clap!

3551
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:46,760
Clap!

3552
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,580
Oh god, where did he go?

3553
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:51,660
Where did he go?

3554
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:52,840
Get over here!

3555
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:53,560
Get over here!

3556
02:08:53,580 --> 02:08:54,260
Get over here!

3557
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:57,160
Yeah!

3558
02:08:57,580 --> 02:08:58,020
Guys!

3559
02:08:59,200 --> 02:08:59,640
Guys!

3560
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:00,720
Please!

3561
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,180
Get over here!

3562
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:08,800
Goodbye!

3563
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:10,160
He's won!

3564
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,140
He's literally won!

3565
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:14,340
I can't dance!

3566
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:16,520
I can't dance!

3567
02:09:16,820 --> 02:09:18,560
I'm dancing the best I could right now!

3568
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:19,980
I'm...

3569
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:22,700
I'm trying so hard to dance!

3570
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:24,900
I'm trying so hard to dance!

3571
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:26,720
Wait, Spider-Man isn't on Spider-Man!

3572
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:27,660
Wait, Spider-Man isn't on Spider-Man!

3573
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:28,600
What a scam!

3574
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:34,620
Spider-Man's on fucking Storm!

3575
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:38,260
Spider-Man's on fucking Storm!

3576
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:40,840
I'm gonna clap for life!

3577
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,640
I'm gonna clap for life!

3578
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:43,680
Oh no!

3579
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:44,960
He's gonna hit me again!

3580
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:50,040
Oh no, I missed!

3581
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:52,100
Oh, thank god!

3582
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:54,140
Oh, thank god!

3583
02:09:56,640 --> 02:09:58,260
Oh, thank god!

3584
02:09:58,560 --> 02:09:58,740
Oh, thank god!

3585
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:02,810
Where's Venom?

3586
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:05,730
Oh god!

3587
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:06,950
Oh god, no!

3588
02:10:08,270 --> 02:10:09,270
Skylar Witch!

3589
02:10:11,610 --> 02:10:12,750
Please, team!

3590
02:10:14,130 --> 02:10:15,290
What are you...

3591
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:16,730
What the fuck?

3592
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:20,770
Please, I lived for so long!

3593
02:10:20,930 --> 02:10:21,710
Team, please!

3594
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:23,050
Do not...

3595
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:24,090
I will dance!

3596
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:27,730
I will fucking dance if it's the last thing I do!

3597
02:10:29,810 --> 02:10:31,970
I will keep on dancing!

3598
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:36,270
Eh.

3599
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:38,770
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

3600
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:40,170
You're... you're... get healed, get healed.

3601
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:41,750
Get healed, get healed.

3602
02:10:42,270 --> 02:10:42,790
Clap!

3603
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:44,390
Clap!

3604
02:10:44,610 --> 02:10:45,030
Clap!

3605
02:10:45,150 --> 02:10:45,530
Clap!

3606
02:10:45,970 --> 02:10:46,810
Get healed!

3607
02:10:46,870 --> 02:10:47,370
Get healed!

3608
02:10:47,490 --> 02:10:47,990
Get healed!

3609
02:10:48,970 --> 02:10:50,250
I will clap!

3610
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:50,850
Clap!

3611
02:10:52,030 --> 02:10:52,550
Yay!

3612
02:10:54,890 --> 02:10:55,410
Yay!

3613
02:10:55,530 --> 02:10:57,010
Now it's attack time!

3614
02:10:57,730 --> 02:10:58,130
Yay!

3615
02:10:58,510 --> 02:10:59,430
Kill everybody!

3616
02:11:01,190 --> 02:11:01,710
Yeah!

3617
02:11:03,910 --> 02:11:04,430
Okay.

3618
02:11:04,990 --> 02:11:05,690
Oh god.

3619
02:11:07,230 --> 02:11:07,670
Oh!

3620
02:11:08,190 --> 02:11:08,630
Please.

3621
02:11:09,650 --> 02:11:11,490
I'm trying to be alive right now.

3622
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:14,450
Okay, he's dead.

3623
02:11:14,930 --> 02:11:15,590
Thank god.

3624
02:11:15,690 --> 02:11:16,950
I had the big heal.

3625
02:11:17,110 --> 02:11:20,870
You can also... it's like Lucio, where you can change into damage boost too.

3626
02:11:21,090 --> 02:11:22,850
Or not Lucio, wait, it's like Juno!

3627
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:24,730
Where you can change into damage!

3628
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:27,310
Alright.

3629
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:28,770
Who has my...

3630
02:11:28,770 --> 02:11:31,110
Okay, I'm getting rid of the Loki puppet though.

3631
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:32,850
Oh god.

3632
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:33,850
Oh god, clap!

3633
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:34,930
Clap!

3634
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:38,870
Come on, come on, Scarlet Witch, live!

3635
02:11:43,150 --> 02:11:43,650
Oh no!

3636
02:11:43,990 --> 02:11:44,650
Venom!

3637
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:46,570
Oh!

3638
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:48,430
That was close.

3639
02:11:49,030 --> 02:11:49,710
Wait!

3640
02:11:49,870 --> 02:11:50,670
Oh, that's you.

3641
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:52,350
Wait, what the fuck?

3642
02:11:52,370 --> 02:11:53,210
Who killed everybody?

3643
02:11:54,610 --> 02:11:55,190
Who's dead?

3644
02:11:56,130 --> 02:11:57,850
Like, who's fucking died?

3645
02:11:58,210 --> 02:12:00,070
I got like assists and everything.

3646
02:12:02,710 --> 02:12:03,550
Oh god.

3647
02:12:03,630 --> 02:12:04,470
Oh, I missed!

3648
02:12:04,710 --> 02:12:05,370
It's okay!

3649
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:06,590
Clap, clap, clap!

3650
02:12:09,190 --> 02:12:09,750
Guys!

3651
02:12:11,410 --> 02:12:12,010
Oh, it's okay!

3652
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:13,050
It's still okay!

3653
02:12:13,470 --> 02:12:14,830
It's still okay!

3654
02:12:15,070 --> 02:12:16,250
We're still okay!

3655
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:18,270
We're so healthy!

3656
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:20,710
Oh, we're so healthy, guys!

3657
02:12:21,630 --> 02:12:23,110
Guys, we're so healthy!

3658
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:26,230
Oh, we're so healthy, guys.

3659
02:12:28,710 --> 02:12:29,650
Where's my...

3660
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:31,870
Oh, don't worry!

3661
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:34,410
I killed just in time!

3662
02:12:36,670 --> 02:12:37,590
Now fight!

3663
02:12:38,810 --> 02:12:39,370
Now heal!

3664
02:12:39,490 --> 02:12:40,090
Now fight!

3665
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:42,130
Now heal!

3666
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:43,830
Now me!

3667
02:12:45,370 --> 02:12:46,990
I think I froze it!

3668
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:48,290
Wait, I froze the ult!

3669
02:12:48,910 --> 02:12:50,790
Wait, that's fucking... that's fucking cool.

3670
02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:52,530
I think I froze it.

3671
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:54,550
Okay, where's the...

3672
02:13:04,270 --> 02:13:06,610
Please, don't die because I'm dead!

3673
02:13:07,130 --> 02:13:08,250
Oh, nice, nice!

3674
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:09,390
Good job, Iron Man!

3675
02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:10,390
Track him!

3676
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:12,210
Oh, it's overtime!

3677
02:13:12,370 --> 02:13:12,850
It's overtime!

3678
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:14,630
I'm heading over to everybody's critical!

3679
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:16,750
Oh, we did it!

3680
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:20,090
He's getting a pocket... No!

3681
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:27,890
Oh my god, it's so painful to be...

3682
02:13:27,890 --> 02:13:31,590
It's so painful playing the only support!

3683
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:36,390
Oh my god, his team... his team...

3684
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:38,630
...lid because of me!

3685
02:13:39,170 --> 02:13:42,850
I did 18,000 heals!

3686
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:44,690
Holy shit!

3687
02:13:45,710 --> 02:13:50,590
Oh my god, you better fucking endorse me after all I did for you!

3688
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:51,370
I...

3689
02:13:52,670 --> 02:13:53,570
Oh my god!

3690
02:13:53,730 --> 02:13:55,490
They did so much damage, though.

3691
02:13:55,490 --> 02:13:58,470
12k, 13k, 12k...

3692
02:13:58,470 --> 02:14:04,010
Like, our team had the most damage, but I had to keep all of these shitters alive!

3693
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:07,650
Alright, last game.

3694
02:14:10,570 --> 02:14:11,950
That Scarlet Witch, though.

3695
02:14:12,030 --> 02:14:15,830
I wish I could... I wish there was a void system so I could avoid the Scarlet Witch right now.

3696
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:21,510
Like, I... I don't... I do not want her on my team.

3697
02:14:22,730 --> 02:14:25,230
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

3698
02:14:26,590 --> 02:14:27,150
Alright.

3699
02:14:29,450 --> 02:14:30,570
Let's see...

3700
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:34,110
Last game...

3701
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:35,250
Last game...

3702
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:36,250
You know what?

3703
02:14:37,330 --> 02:14:39,510
I will try...

3704
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:43,510
I'm going to try...

3705
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:46,190
I'll try magic.

3706
02:14:46,850 --> 02:14:48,070
Alright, let's see magic.

3707
02:14:49,290 --> 02:14:54,430
Transform into a dark child, jump through a... transporting a short distance, dash forward, and launch an enemy.

3708
02:14:54,430 --> 02:14:56,590
Magic Slash.

3709
02:14:56,630 --> 02:14:58,630
Oh god, that is so fucking... what?

3710
02:14:59,550 --> 02:15:00,150
Okay.

3711
02:15:01,710 --> 02:15:03,510
And then I can charge it.

3712
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:05,870
And then...

3713
02:15:06,610 --> 02:15:07,210
Okay.

3714
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:08,390
Nice.

3715
02:15:10,010 --> 02:15:10,610
Okay.

3716
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:11,490
And then...

3717
02:15:13,590 --> 02:15:14,970
Okay, that's the charge.

3718
02:15:15,190 --> 02:15:15,430
Alright.

3719
02:15:17,530 --> 02:15:19,430
Alright, let's see.

3720
02:15:21,370 --> 02:15:22,930
Nobody seems to play her.

3721
02:15:23,050 --> 02:15:24,410
I know, like, during the...

3722
02:15:24,410 --> 02:15:27,570
Alpha launch, she was really broken during Alpha.

3723
02:15:28,150 --> 02:15:29,610
But like, I don't know about now.

3724
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:31,790
Obviously, it could be different now.

3725
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:35,150
Alpha version was broken.

3726
02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:36,070
That's all I remember.

3727
02:15:40,430 --> 02:15:43,150
Oh my god, why are they always in the fucking sky?

3728
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:44,490
This is bullshit.

3729
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:48,730
Okay.

3730
02:15:49,630 --> 02:15:50,110
Um...

3731
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:52,330
How do I do this?

3732
02:15:54,070 --> 02:15:55,050
How do I...

3733
02:15:58,110 --> 02:15:59,310
Oh shit!

3734
02:15:59,510 --> 02:16:00,870
Wait, what a killer!

3735
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:02,550
It's not fair!

3736
02:16:02,650 --> 02:16:03,770
She's in the sky!

3737
02:16:05,210 --> 02:16:07,250
This is literally not fair!

3738
02:16:07,430 --> 02:16:08,650
She's literally in the sky!

3739
02:16:12,950 --> 02:16:14,830
She's literally in the sky!

3740
02:16:17,070 --> 02:16:19,790
How can I kill something in the sky?

3741
02:16:20,230 --> 02:16:21,590
It's not fair.

3742
02:16:21,770 --> 02:16:22,310
Oh my god, that is so fucking...

3743
02:16:22,310 --> 02:16:24,810
How do I kill something in the sky?

3744
02:16:25,610 --> 02:16:27,290
I'm so mad!

3745
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:29,030
Oh, I'm dead.

3746
02:16:33,210 --> 02:16:35,710
I'm so mad.

3747
02:16:38,930 --> 02:16:42,730
How do I... Oh, okay, that's the cooldown.

3748
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:45,270
Alright, that's the cooldown.

3749
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:46,430
You can't cook.

3750
02:16:46,430 --> 02:16:48,270
It's off-BOOM!

3751
02:16:48,970 --> 02:16:51,410
It fucking... It was in the sky!

3752
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:53,670
I can't fucking do anything about it!

3753
02:16:56,730 --> 02:16:58,750
Okay, I need to know the cooldown for that.

3754
02:16:59,010 --> 02:16:59,830
Get over here.

3755
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:01,110
Get over here.

3756
02:17:01,530 --> 02:17:02,610
Get over here.

3757
02:17:03,510 --> 02:17:05,390
Fucking... Get over here.

3758
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:09,650
Like, what do I do?!

3759
02:17:12,550 --> 02:17:13,570
That's what I do.

3760
02:17:17,150 --> 02:17:19,430
Because that's what I do.

3761
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:27,970
I thought there would be more people.

3762
02:17:31,250 --> 02:17:32,510
Mosquito god.

3763
02:17:32,930 --> 02:17:34,230
This bullshit!

3764
02:17:37,970 --> 02:17:38,870
Get over here!

3765
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:39,550
Get over here!

3766
02:17:39,630 --> 02:17:40,810
You can't block a sword!

3767
02:17:41,290 --> 02:17:42,370
Wait, that's not fair!

3768
02:17:42,890 --> 02:17:43,890
Get over here!

3769
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:45,190
Get over here!

3770
02:17:45,310 --> 02:17:46,410
You can't fucking stay here!

3771
02:17:46,430 --> 02:17:47,090
You can't stay up there forever!

3772
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:51,770
That's not fair!

3773
02:17:52,050 --> 02:17:54,670
He literally stayed up there forever!

3774
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:01,630
Get over here.

3775
02:18:01,710 --> 02:18:02,410
No.

3776
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:03,450
No.

3777
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:05,590
There we go.

3778
02:18:09,070 --> 02:18:10,970
That's literally not fair.

3779
02:18:12,370 --> 02:18:13,730
Get over... Get away.

3780
02:18:14,070 --> 02:18:14,990
Get away!

3781
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:18,770
Oh no, it's the eye.

3782
02:18:22,130 --> 02:18:22,610
Okay.

3783
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:23,990
I don't have the...

3784
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:26,830
That's fucking right!

3785
02:18:26,910 --> 02:18:27,750
Get over here!

3786
02:18:28,330 --> 02:18:28,810
Get...

3787
02:18:30,330 --> 02:18:31,830
You can't run away from me!

3788
02:18:31,830 --> 02:18:32,310
I have a sword!

3789
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:34,250
Where are you?!

3790
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:35,490
I have a sword!

3791
02:18:36,570 --> 02:18:37,650
That's fucking right!

3792
02:18:37,930 --> 02:18:39,030
Yeah, that's right, Loki.

3793
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:39,510
You scared.

3794
02:18:39,950 --> 02:18:40,750
Oh shit!

3795
02:18:40,970 --> 02:18:42,110
Oh shit, I'm scared.

3796
02:18:42,630 --> 02:18:43,590
Oh, goodbye.

3797
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:44,390
Bye.

3798
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:47,690
Oh shit!

3799
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:48,310
Oh shit!

3800
02:18:48,770 --> 02:18:49,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

3801
02:18:50,130 --> 02:18:51,010
I'm so sorry.

3802
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:52,250
I'm so sorry!

3803
02:18:52,530 --> 02:18:53,830
I'm so sorry!

3804
02:18:56,070 --> 02:18:58,370
Oh my god, he went for me!

3805
02:18:58,590 --> 02:18:59,950
That's fucked up!

3806
02:19:00,770 --> 02:19:02,170
That's fucked up!

3807
02:19:02,650 --> 02:19:05,050
You fucking ran at me!

3808
02:19:05,390 --> 02:19:08,810
Bro, they have Spider-Man and Tony Stark?!

3809
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:11,370
Alright, we're okay.

3810
02:19:12,510 --> 02:19:13,230
We're okay.

3811
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:13,890
We're okay.

3812
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,030
Okay.

3813
02:19:18,090 --> 02:19:18,550
Nice.

3814
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:19,010
Alright.

3815
02:19:19,650 --> 02:19:20,690
What I can do is that.

3816
02:19:25,230 --> 02:19:26,850
JK, I... JK, I lied!

3817
02:19:27,150 --> 02:19:27,850
Get me out of here!

3818
02:19:27,990 --> 02:19:28,710
Get me out of here!

3819
02:19:30,830 --> 02:19:32,470
Bro, he's fucking a mosquito!

3820
02:19:33,710 --> 02:19:35,150
That's the only thing that sucks.

3821
02:19:35,430 --> 02:19:36,610
The mosquito shit.

3822
02:19:37,090 --> 02:19:39,410
Like, I don't know what to do when that happens.

3823
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:42,670
Get over here.

3824
02:19:43,410 --> 02:19:44,270
Yeah, that's right!

3825
02:19:44,310 --> 02:19:44,910
You're stuck!

3826
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:45,810
You're stuck!

3827
02:19:46,570 --> 02:19:47,850
You're fucking stuck!

3828
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:49,430
Oh, wait.

3829
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:50,630
He's literally one.

3830
02:19:51,210 --> 02:19:52,390
He's literally one.

3831
02:19:52,570 --> 02:19:53,610
Somebody just...

3832
02:19:54,730 --> 02:19:55,770
Just shoot him!

3833
02:19:57,070 --> 02:19:59,410
I can't shoot him because I have a sword!

3834
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:02,150
He's gonna get this guy out of the way.

3835
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:03,490
We'll get the Spider-Man.

3836
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:06,310
Get him.

3837
02:20:06,330 --> 02:20:06,790
Get him too.

3838
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:08,090
Get him too!

3839
02:20:08,230 --> 02:20:09,710
You can't block a sword!

3840
02:20:11,630 --> 02:20:12,150
Okay.

3841
02:20:12,330 --> 02:20:16,310
I find it really dumb that you can't block a sword, though.

3842
02:20:16,550 --> 02:20:17,870
I think that's stupid.

3843
02:20:19,930 --> 02:20:20,890
That's fucking right.

3844
02:20:20,990 --> 02:20:21,850
Where are you?

3845
02:20:22,990 --> 02:20:24,170
That's fucking right!

3846
02:20:24,470 --> 02:20:24,990
Yeah!

3847
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:26,550
Oh, Luna!

3848
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:29,330
You're scared, Luna, aren't you?

3849
02:20:29,410 --> 02:20:30,290
Wait, where did you... Luna?

3850
02:20:30,390 --> 02:20:31,290
Where did Luna go?

3851
02:20:31,690 --> 02:20:33,010
Where did Luna go?

3852
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:34,590
Is she dead?

3853
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:38,070
She... What?

3854
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:38,870
It's scary.

3855
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:41,550
Alright.

3856
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:43,670
What the fuck?

3857
02:20:46,090 --> 02:20:46,690
Oh.

3858
02:20:46,690 --> 02:20:47,290
Okay.

3859
02:20:52,890 --> 02:20:53,910
That's fucking right!

3860
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:55,150
Get over here, Loki!

3861
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:55,930
Yeah!

3862
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:57,130
Yeah!

3863
02:20:57,170 --> 02:20:57,610
Oh, goodbye!

3864
02:20:58,010 --> 02:20:58,530
Goodbye!

3865
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:01,890
Okay.

3866
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:06,630
I lived longer than I thought I was going to.

3867
02:21:07,050 --> 02:21:08,430
Straight up locked.

3868
02:21:09,210 --> 02:21:10,810
Coming back, guys!

3869
02:21:11,710 --> 02:21:12,930
Magic's coming back!

3870
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:16,590
Don't worry!

3871
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:19,130
I'm coming back!

3872
02:21:20,290 --> 02:21:21,210
Where is he?

3873
02:21:21,850 --> 02:21:23,390
Where the fuck is he?

3874
02:21:25,810 --> 02:21:27,670
Where are you, Spider-Man?

3875
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:30,530
Where the fuck are you?

3876
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:31,690
Ooh, you're trying to run?

3877
02:21:32,510 --> 02:21:33,390
Get down!

3878
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:34,810
I'm the Spider-Killer!

3879
02:21:36,990 --> 02:21:38,410
Get over here!

3880
02:21:39,010 --> 02:21:40,150
That's fucking right!

3881
02:21:40,810 --> 02:21:41,890
Get over here!

3882
02:21:42,270 --> 02:21:43,330
Where are you?

3883
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:45,670
Hey, where are them, Lost?

3884
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:47,350
Actually, where are they?

3885
02:21:47,710 --> 02:21:49,110
That's fucking Tony Stark!

3886
02:21:50,250 --> 02:21:52,570
Ooh, hey there, buddy!

3887
02:21:53,010 --> 02:21:53,850
Hey there!

3888
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:58,190
Is there... Who's healing you?

3889
02:21:58,750 --> 02:21:59,830
Fucking bullshit.

3890
02:22:00,350 --> 02:22:00,930
Killers.

3891
02:22:03,550 --> 02:22:04,630
That's fucking right.

3892
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:08,330
Where the fuck is Terminator?

3893
02:22:11,330 --> 02:22:13,150
I'm the pest control.

3894
02:22:15,770 --> 02:22:17,610
I squashed some bugs.

3895
02:22:17,950 --> 02:22:20,310
I feel like I don't die!

3896
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:23,550
Like, I like... I don't know.

3897
02:22:23,610 --> 02:22:25,070
I think I had really good healers.

3898
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:25,770
Cause like, yeah!

3899
02:22:25,790 --> 02:22:27,130
Holy shit!

3900
02:22:27,790 --> 02:22:29,150
15k healing!

3901
02:22:29,630 --> 02:22:33,170
Our Rocky Raccoon, like, clutched up.

3902
02:22:33,170 --> 02:22:34,350
He healed me!

3903
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:39,510
He actually healed me so much!

3904
02:22:39,950 --> 02:22:42,430
Cause I was just going in and fucking...

3905
02:22:43,310 --> 02:22:44,910
Going in YOLO style.

3906
02:22:46,030 --> 02:22:48,110
I must be so tilting to heal.

3907
02:22:49,310 --> 02:22:53,450
I will not be surprised if I was a bitch to heal that time.

3908
02:22:54,130 --> 02:22:54,410
Uh...

3909
02:22:56,270 --> 02:22:58,430
It should not be a leaderboard.

3910
02:22:58,790 --> 02:22:59,390
Yet.

3911
02:23:01,010 --> 02:23:02,750
Oh, that was a good support player.

3912
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:05,950
He like, enabled me to do whatever the fuck I want there.

3913
02:23:07,630 --> 02:23:08,070
Alright!

3914
02:23:08,910 --> 02:23:10,650
I think that's a good time to call it.

3915
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:11,090
Woo!

3916
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:13,070
That was really fun!

3917
02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:14,690
I had a great time.

3918
02:23:14,890 --> 02:23:16,450
Checking out the, uh...

3919
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:18,750
The beta test this time.

3920
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:23,570
Um... I'm looking forward to trying out the rank system to see what they change to it.

3921
02:23:23,710 --> 02:23:24,630
But that was really, really fun!

3922
02:23:25,510 --> 02:23:30,250
Um... I hope you guys enjoyed Marvel Rivals and like, the shit you can do.

3923
02:23:30,430 --> 02:23:31,970
It's definitely right now for me.

3924
02:23:31,970 --> 02:23:33,950
Marvel Rivals feels very casual.

3925
02:23:34,170 --> 02:23:35,930
Maybe it's because I'm not playing rank at the moment.

3926
02:23:36,110 --> 02:23:37,230
But, um...

3927
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:38,770
It feels very casual.

3928
02:23:38,790 --> 02:23:40,350
Something to play to like...

3929
02:23:40,350 --> 02:23:41,050
Just like, like...

3930
02:23:41,050 --> 02:23:42,930
Uh... Just to like, fuck around with.

3931
02:23:43,110 --> 02:23:44,230
But it was really fun!

3932
02:23:44,510 --> 02:23:45,570
I definitely enjoyed it a lot.

3933
02:23:45,610 --> 02:23:46,990
I think it'll be definitely more fun with friends.

3934
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:49,690
But like, as a solo player playing it today...

3935
02:23:49,690 --> 02:23:51,810
I definitely had, um...

3936
02:23:51,810 --> 02:23:53,270
A lot of fun playing it.

3937
02:23:53,350 --> 02:23:54,850
And just like, playing around with the different characters.

3938
02:23:54,990 --> 02:23:56,030
I did not like Tank.

3939
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:56,970
Playing Tank there.

3940
02:23:57,310 --> 02:23:57,710
Uh...

3941
02:23:57,710 --> 02:23:58,810
Ha ha ha ha!

3942
02:23:59,070 --> 02:24:00,090
And you like...

3943
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:01,430
The reason why is that Tank...

3944
02:24:01,430 --> 02:24:03,110
You have to rely so much on your healers.

3945
02:24:03,250 --> 02:24:04,070
And like...

3946
02:24:04,070 --> 02:24:05,570
I don't trust healers.

3947
02:24:05,650 --> 02:24:07,470
I don't trust like, random healers.

3948
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:08,250
Ha ha ha!

3949
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:10,130
Like, I don't trust randoms.

3950
02:24:10,130 --> 02:24:10,730
At all.

3951
02:24:12,150 --> 02:24:12,630
So...

3952
02:24:12,630 --> 02:24:13,110
Uh...

3953
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:13,730
Ha ha ha!

3954
02:24:14,810 --> 02:24:15,290
So...

3955
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:17,250
So that's why...

3956
02:24:17,250 --> 02:24:18,450
I don't like playing Tank.

3957
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:19,550
And DPS is fine.

3958
02:24:19,690 --> 02:24:20,710
Because DPS are more squishy.

3959
02:24:21,310 --> 02:24:22,830
But like, at least they do damage.

3960
02:24:23,090 --> 02:24:25,770
At least they do a lot more damage to justify it.

3961
02:24:26,170 --> 02:24:26,650
Um...

3962
02:24:26,650 --> 02:24:28,610
My favorite support currently is Adam.

3963
02:24:29,010 --> 02:24:30,930
Adam seems really fun to play.

3964
02:24:30,930 --> 02:24:31,690
As a support.

3965
02:24:32,330 --> 02:24:32,770
Um...

3966
02:24:32,770 --> 02:24:34,090
They nerfed the shit out of Loki.

3967
02:24:34,210 --> 02:24:35,550
So like, he's not as fun anymore.

3968
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:37,910
And like, his heals are actually like...

3969
02:24:37,910 --> 02:24:39,010
Pretty bad.

3970
02:24:39,330 --> 02:24:39,930
Ha ha ha!

3971
02:24:40,130 --> 02:24:42,090
Compared to Adam IMO.

3972
02:24:42,610 --> 02:24:43,050
Um...

3973
02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:44,090
Because like, at this point...

3974
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:45,410
If you want a lot of healing...

3975
02:24:45,410 --> 02:24:46,210
Then you play Luna Snow.

3976
02:24:46,430 --> 02:24:47,750
Because her healings are insane.

3977
02:24:48,210 --> 02:24:49,710
Her healings are really good.

3978
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:51,270
And the reason why I liked Loki...

3979
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:52,170
Was because of like...

3980
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:53,710
His DPS and heals.

3981
02:24:53,930 --> 02:24:55,850
But like, his DPS was so low!

3982
02:24:56,370 --> 02:24:59,410
I felt like his DPS was not as high...

3983
02:24:59,410 --> 02:25:00,310
As before.

3984
02:25:00,310 --> 02:25:02,190
So I'm pretty sure they nerfed the shit out of that.

3985
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:03,110
Um...

3986
02:25:03,110 --> 02:25:04,230
DPS in general...

3987
02:25:04,230 --> 02:25:05,930
I think I like Hela the most.

3988
02:25:06,310 --> 02:25:09,050
Hela was the most fun for me when it came to DPS.

3989
02:25:10,090 --> 02:25:10,530
And...

3990
02:25:10,530 --> 02:25:11,310
Um...

3991
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:12,650
Other than that...

3992
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:14,470
Hela and...

3993
02:25:14,470 --> 02:25:15,410
Yeah, I think Hela was...

3994
02:25:15,410 --> 02:25:16,910
I guess Punisher for like...

3995
02:25:16,910 --> 02:25:18,170
Soldier for Call of Duty.

3996
02:25:19,790 --> 02:25:20,230
Um...

3997
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:21,390
And everything...

3998
02:25:21,390 --> 02:25:22,650
I felt like I was tickling the enemies.

3999
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:23,030
Yeah.

4000
02:25:23,430 --> 02:25:23,870
Uh...

4001
02:25:23,870 --> 02:25:24,530
For...

4002
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:25,310
For Loki.

4003
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:26,790
So it just didn't feel worth it.

4004
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:27,490
Because like...

4005
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:28,450
Okay, Loki was like...

4006
02:25:28,450 --> 02:25:30,230
A good balance between DPS and heals.

4007
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:31,110
But even then...

4008
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:31,370
Like...

4009
02:25:31,370 --> 02:25:32,750
It did not feel like I was healing...

4010
02:25:32,750 --> 02:25:34,670
It did not feel like I was actually healing anybody.

4011
02:25:35,030 --> 02:25:35,490
Like...

4012
02:25:35,490 --> 02:25:37,310
I felt like everybody was dying.

4013
02:25:37,710 --> 02:25:40,170
I was trying to heal people as Loki.

4014
02:25:40,470 --> 02:25:42,910
I think you're supposed to have three clones out of him.

4015
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:45,410
You're supposed to have like three clones or something.

4016
02:25:46,090 --> 02:25:46,570
Um...

4017
02:25:46,570 --> 02:25:47,770
And so...

4018
02:25:47,770 --> 02:25:49,210
To justify the heals.

4019
02:25:49,310 --> 02:25:51,490
But there's a cooldown when it came to that.

4020
02:25:51,690 --> 02:25:52,850
So I'm just like...

4021
02:25:52,850 --> 02:25:53,370
Uh...

4022
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:56,050
Oh yeah.

4023
02:25:56,110 --> 02:25:57,550
Iron Man's orb was fucking crazy.

4024
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:58,430
That shit was insane.

4025
02:25:58,430 --> 02:26:01,250
Like I was not expecting that.

4026
02:26:01,470 --> 02:26:02,210
Alright guys!

4027
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:03,210
I'm gonna call it here.

4028
02:26:03,470 --> 02:26:05,250
I think I already lost Super Chats while we were playing.

4029
02:26:05,430 --> 02:26:05,790
So...

4030
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:06,370
Um...

4031
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:07,610
I'm gonna call it here today.

4032
02:26:08,090 --> 02:26:08,570
Um...

4033
02:26:08,570 --> 02:26:10,130
As always everybody...

4034
02:26:10,130 --> 02:26:11,190
Stay hydrated.

4035
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:12,170
Posture check.

4036
02:26:12,290 --> 02:26:14,090
Get up and around to get that blood flowing.

4037
02:26:14,190 --> 02:26:16,090
And if you stayed up for me...

4038
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:16,770
Head to bed.

4039
02:26:16,910 --> 02:26:18,190
Cause you deserve it.

4040
02:26:18,290 --> 02:26:19,310
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4041
02:26:19,910 --> 02:26:20,510
Bye guys!

4042
02:26:20,830 --> 02:26:21,930
Also by the way...

4043
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:22,410
Um...

4044
02:26:22,410 --> 02:26:23,090
I think like...

4045
02:26:23,090 --> 02:26:23,510
Thursday.

4046
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:24,510
Is it Thursday?

4047
02:26:24,730 --> 02:26:25,930
Thursday is our first...

4048
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:26,410
Not first.

4049
02:26:26,430 --> 02:26:28,330
Our second official sponsor!

4050
02:26:28,350 --> 02:26:28,410
So...

4051
02:26:28,430 --> 02:26:28,750
Thursday stream!

4052
02:26:28,910 --> 02:26:29,690
With Cookie Run!

4053
02:26:29,870 --> 02:26:30,870
Cookie Run hit me up.

4054
02:26:30,910 --> 02:26:31,510
Asking if I...

4055
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:33,410
If I was willing to do a sponsored stream for them.

4056
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:34,010
So I'm super excited.

4057
02:26:34,110 --> 02:26:35,490
I've never played Cookie Run before.

4058
02:26:36,170 --> 02:26:36,570
Um...

4059
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:37,930
Never in my life before.

4060
02:26:38,210 --> 02:26:38,610
So...

4061
02:26:38,610 --> 02:26:38,950
Um...

4062
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:40,190
I'm really excited to check it out.

4063
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:40,790
Apparently...

4064
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:41,770
A lot of people were like...

4065
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:42,390
Really...

4066
02:26:42,390 --> 02:26:42,910
Really...

4067
02:26:43,370 --> 02:26:43,770
Um...

4068
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:45,910
Hyped up that I'm trying out Cookie Run.

4069
02:26:46,350 --> 02:26:46,750
Um...

4070
02:26:46,750 --> 02:26:47,250
So...

4071
02:26:47,250 --> 02:26:47,470
Yeah!

4072
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:48,490
I'm looking forward to it.

4073
02:26:48,930 --> 02:26:49,330
Anyway...

4074
02:26:49,330 --> 02:26:50,090
Um...

4075
02:26:50,090 --> 02:26:51,830
Make sure to support Thursday's stream!

4076
02:26:52,010 --> 02:26:53,890
For the sponsored Cookie Run Kingdom!

4077
02:26:54,490 --> 02:26:54,890
Uh...

4078
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:55,730
See you guys next time everybody!

4079
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:56,750
Bye guys!

4080
02:26:57,470 --> 02:26:57,870
Um...

4081
02:26:59,410 --> 02:26:59,650
Bye!

4082
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:02,010
I need to look for the ending screen.

4083
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:02,410
Where is it?

4084
02:27:02,510 --> 02:27:02,870
Oh there it is!

4085
02:27:03,050 --> 02:27:03,290
Haha!

4086
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:03,910
Bye!
