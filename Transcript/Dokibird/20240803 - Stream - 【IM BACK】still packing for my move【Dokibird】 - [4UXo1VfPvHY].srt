1
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,280
Get baited.

2
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,580
You get zero loops!

3
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,420
That's right.

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,480
I got my food.

5
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,520
So no loop for you.

6
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,520
If you guys want a loop, just play the video.

7
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,340
It's uploaded.

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,480
Just play the video.

9
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,280
So I can get my ad revenue.

10
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:30,980
Guys, you must be like, wow, Doki, you were gone for like almost one week and all you care about is money now?

11
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,460
Yes, because moving was expensive.

12
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,240
Guys, I need every penny I can get right now.

13
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,000
Holy shit.

14
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,540
I did not realize how expensive moving was.

15
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,600
Vacation, it was not a vacation.

16
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,860
Oh, no, no, no, no.

17
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,980
Anyway, guys, for those who are like, Doki, please, loop.

18
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,840
Play this video so I can get my ad revenue.

19
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,340
Loop, loop this.

20
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,240
If I owned a house I would live there until I'd fucking die.

21
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,720
I learned a leave ever again.

22
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,300
The dragon.

23
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,780
Give us back to loop.

24
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,040
Welcome back, by the way.

25
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,480
Thank you for the super cha you, thank you, thank you, Sean.

26
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,880
Thank you for this super cha.

27
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,400
Thank you.

28
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,040
Thank you, super shock.

29
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,560
Thank you for this super cha.

30
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,640
Empty voltage.

31
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,480
Thank you, thank you, my teacher!

32
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,820
No guys, no, you don't understand!

33
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,660
This is like... okay.

34
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,680
I moved around a lot before in the past.

35
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,500
Like, I've like, you know...

36
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I've always been moving.

37
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,060
But like...

38
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,500
This is the first time I've ever moved all by myself.

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,720
Like, I've done it all...

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,540
Like, usually my parents would help me with stuff like that.

41
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,960
Like, finding a place...

42
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,940
Having a car to help me with moving...

43
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,840
Arranging everything...

44
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,140
But this is the very first time...

45
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,800
I did almost everything myself.

46
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,300
Except for like, there were some parts.

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,840
And...

48
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,360
I'm a real adult now.

49
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,900
And this is the first time...

50
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,980
I've ever like...

51
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,620
Paid for everything myself too.

52
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,360
So like, now I actually know how much everything costs.

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,040
So...

54
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,920
Is this...

55
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,620
Is this the first time...

56
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,180
I've actually like, looked at how much everything costs.

57
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,920
And I was like...

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,880
Holy fucking shit!

59
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,240
Okay...

60
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,680
Yeah, so...

61
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,540
I'm finally moving to...

62
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,000
Like...

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,120
Okay, so...

64
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,420
I don't know how to stream right now.

65
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,260
It's been a while.

66
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,760
You know, like when you're out of your routine.

67
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,400
You're out of your fucking routine.

68
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,780
And...

69
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,120
You're just like...

70
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,600
How do I...

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:21,960
How do I...

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,460
How do I...

73
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,640
How do I do this again?

74
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,860
How do I interact with people?

75
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,320
How do I not be antisocial?

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,120
So, I need a while to like, get into...

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,820
Into the groove of things.

78
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,800
Also, HonGeorge!

79
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,860
Thank you for the Akasupa!

80
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,320
Thank you!

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
I just got my own house this month.

82
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,100
Is this a good time to tell you?

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,260
Thank you for the Akasupa!

84
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you!

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,140
But yes, for those who's never moved before...

86
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,320
Or have always had their parents help them...

87
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,900
Or like, relatives or friends help them...

88
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,620
And like, they've never done the adult move...

89
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,280
Um...

90
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
To like...

91
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,780
Uh...

92
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,320
Hahaha!

93
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,200
To...

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,400
To pay for like, the move and everything...

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
And all the other stuff...

96
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,020
It is a lot!

97
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,580
It...

98
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,780
I...

99
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,620
If I had to pick between...

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:07,940
Uh...

101
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,440
Hahaha!

102
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,680
Living at a place...

103
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,500
Forever...

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,220
Uh...

105
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,340
And die there...

106
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,420
Instead of ever going to another place again...

107
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,880
I would definitely pick the first option.

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,440
I would...

109
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,420
I never...

110
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh my God!

111
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,160
Thank you so much for the red carpet!

112
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,480
That's a lot of red!

113
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,900
Thank you for the Akasupa!

114
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,580
Thank you!

115
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,560
Here's the red carpet for your new place.

116
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,680
Glad to have you back bro!

117
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,200
Give us a...

118
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,460
No!

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,380
No loops for you!

120
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,160
Literally, there's a whole video for you to loop in!

121
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,940
There's a reason why there's a video!

122
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,760
Hahaha!

123
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,640
Um...

124
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,020
Oh my God!

125
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,620
Thank you!

126
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,460
Thank you everybody for the Akas!

127
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,360
I really appreciate it!

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,760
Thank you everybody!

129
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,460
Oh my God!

130
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,580
I really...

131
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,580
I really...

132
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,900
Okay look, I'll give you guys the next best thing.

133
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
Give me a sec.

134
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,200
I'll give you guys...

135
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,740
I'll give you guys the next best thing.

136
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,260
Okay?

137
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,260
Instead of...

138
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,800
Instead of a...

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,960
Okay, where is it?

140
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,800
Where...

141
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,340
Wow!

142
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,800
What is it called?

143
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,920
Oh my God!

144
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,700
Thank you everybody!

145
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,590
I feel like a celebrity!

146
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,450
Okay, it was funny.

147
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,310
Okay, I tweeted it.

148
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:31,890
I tweeted about it.

149
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,170
But, um...

150
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,930
When...

151
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,650
Um...

152
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:35,970
When...

153
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,330
Um...

154
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,330
Um...

155
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:39,750
Um...

156
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,310
By the way, I'm still at my old apartment right now.

157
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,850
I'm not at the new place yet.

158
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,810
Because like...

159
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:45,550
Uh...

160
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,310
Because like...

161
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,750
They...

162
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,150
I told them to take this last.

163
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,410
Because, you know...

164
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,930
I still need to work.

165
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,110
You know?

166
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,070
So...

167
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,790
I still have my PC here.

168
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,570
Um...

169
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,470
But, what was funny was when...

170
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,350
Um...

171
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,330
Oh my God!

172
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,950
I found Steve Nakasupa!

173
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,390
Thank you!

174
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:04,770
Thank you!

175
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,510
I want to be part of the thing too!

176
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,210
I don't want to miss out on the FOMO!

177
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:08,970
Oh my God!

178
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,530
Thank you everybody!

179
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,550
But like...

180
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,930
Um...

181
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,090
When I was working with the realtor...

182
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,510
Uh...

183
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,250
Agent...

184
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,250
Um...

185
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,130
They were like...

186
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:17,550
Because like...

187
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,870
You know...

188
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,250
They were...

189
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,310
For those who don't know...

190
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,970
We've never done the process of like...

191
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,690
Renting a place.

192
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,550
By the way, it's so difficult to find a place here.

193
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,110
Because it's so competitive.

194
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,390
And like...

195
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,410
And also like...

196
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,230
There's assholes that fucking...

197
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,330
You know...

198
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,990
Buying places just for Airbnbs.

199
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,930
This is why I fucking hate Airbnbs.

200
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:34,610
Uh...

201
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,850
Not only are there like...

202
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,930
Very asshole...

203
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,470
Like...

204
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,930
Landlords for Airbnbs.

205
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,790
That are like...

206
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,470
Really creep...

207
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,650
Sometimes really creepy...

208
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,010
Or like...

209
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,430
Really strict about the rules...

210
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,550
Of Airbnbs.

211
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,670
They buy up majority of the properties here.

212
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,210
And they don't rent it out.

213
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:49,770
They...

214
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,570
It's all like...

215
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,230
Just like...

216
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,510
You have to get it from Airbnbs.

217
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,030
So fuck that shit!

218
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,670
Uh...

219
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,050
So...

220
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,150
So it's super competitive and everything too.

221
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:00,310
So...

222
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,750
It's so fucked.

223
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,130
They're like...

224
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,950
Ruining the house...

225
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,830
We're gonna have another...

226
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,870
God damn housing bubble crash.

227
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,090
Because of it.

228
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,350
Anyway...

229
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,050
Um...

230
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,710
So...

231
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,890
For those who've never like...

232
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,110
Rented or like...

233
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,410
Uh...

234
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,730
Tried to get a place before...

235
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,390
Um...

236
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,370
What you need...

237
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,210
Is to send in pay stubs...

238
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,010
That you're employed.

239
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,650
You know?

240
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,430
That you can...

241
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,070
Afford!

242
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,050
To like...

243
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,930
Pay for a place!

244
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,830
Well...

245
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,190
Obviously...

246
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,590
I get paid...

247
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,330
By...

248
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,290
YouTube.

249
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,190
So...

250
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,290
That's...

251
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,530
So then...

252
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,030
Like by Google and YouTube.

253
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:32,990
So then...

254
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,290
I had to like...

255
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,670
I had to...

256
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,290
I basically sent in...

257
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:37,540
The...

258
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,670
Like the...

259
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,610
The YouTube payments and stuff.

260
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,230
But I didn't like...

261
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,330
Link my channel or anything.

262
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,410
I didn't like...

263
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:43,890
Link it.

264
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,390
So I just...

265
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,390
Was just showed like...

266
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,030
The pay stubs.

267
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,570
Like okay...

268
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,050
Here's like the deposits...

269
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,790
From...

270
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,550
Like YouTube.

271
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,190
Because...

272
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,130
Like they're like...

273
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,290
Who are you employed by?

274
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,130
And then I wrote...

275
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,610
Me.

276
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,150
It was like...

277
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,290
I was like...

278
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,930
Who's your employer?

279
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,890
Because you have to give like...

280
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,430
Contact information...

281
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,150
Of...

282
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,190
Your employer...

283
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:06,730
And everything.

284
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,530
So I literally wrote...

285
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,110
Me.

286
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,430
I am the boss.

287
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,070
And then...

288
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,050
And then I was like...

289
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,190
I own...

290
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,030
The company.

291
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,590
And then I just put my own phone number.

292
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,070
I was just like...

293
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,850
My own...

294
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,270
Like they're like...

295
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,090
What's their phone number?

296
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,030
So we could call them.

297
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,510
And then I put my own phone number.

298
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,430
And...

299
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,330
And then like...

300
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,110
So the realtor agent was like...

301
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,290
I was like...

302
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,210
When they were showing me the place...

303
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,330
They were like...

304
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,030
Oh yeah!

305
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:34,830
Hey!

306
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,390
This is me!

307
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,170
What do you do?

308
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,990
It's my first time working with a YouTube creator!

309
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,750
I've never worked with one before!

310
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,750
And then I was like...

311
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,490
NDA!

312
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,110
I was like...

313
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,430
I was like...

314
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,830
I'm not fucking telling you!

315
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,950
Like what the fuck!

316
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:48,950
Like...

317
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,070
I was just like...

318
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,310
Haha!

319
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,250
NDA!

320
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,090
When you know I'm fucking...

321
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,170
Who am I signing NDA for?

322
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,250
I literally work for myself.

323
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,290
So like...

324
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:56,990
I was just like...

325
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,350
I am my own NDA!

326
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,570
Hahaha!

327
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,270
So I was like...

328
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,750
I didn't sign anything...

329
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,350
But...

330
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,670
You don't know that!

331
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,370
Like...

332
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:07,890
Haha!

333
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,870
Um...

334
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,050
You mean you own the company?

335
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,970
Thank you for the super chat!

336
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,850
Thank you!

337
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,410
Thank you!

338
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,790
The NDA that I drafted myself!

339
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,870
I wrote like...

340
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,450
I'm like...

341
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,030
I'm like...

342
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,630
Um...

343
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,490
Ron Swanson and Parks and Rec.

344
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,230
And then I write on the paper.

345
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:23,890
And it's like...

346
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,750
I am the boss!

347
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,430
Like...

348
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,090
Hahaha!

349
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,150
I just write on the paper.

350
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,250
NDA!

351
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,250
And then I sign it.

352
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,350
I sign my name on it.

353
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:31,650
Haha!

354
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,130
Nox!

355
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,830
Thank you for the super chat!

356
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,170
Thank you!

357
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:33,570
Thank you!

358
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,930
It's me!

359
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,790
I'm the boss!

360
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,050
Thank you for the super chat!

361
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,370
Thank you!

362
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:36,730
Thank you!

363
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,370
Oh yeah!

364
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:37,570
Sorry!

365
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,770
Forgot to give you guys...

366
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,630
The next best thing for a loop.

367
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,450
Give me a sec.

368
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,750
I got really distracted there.

369
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,530
Hahaha!

370
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,770
Give me a sec.

371
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,650
I need to find...

372
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,830
I need to find the file.

373
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,550
Alright.

374
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,150
Let's see.

375
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:51,870
Um...

376
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,830
Is it this?

377
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,510
No.

378
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,390
It has to be this.

379
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,130
No.

380
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,510
It's not.

381
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,310
That's my signature.

382
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:56,890
Is it this?

383
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,570
Oh my god!

384
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:57,870
Okay.

385
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,670
Sorry.

386
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,350
I don't remember my stuff.

387
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,250
Uh...

388
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,430
Oh!

389
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,610
Is it my debut?

390
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,150
Has to be.

391
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,470
Right?

392
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:06,950
No.

393
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,370
It's not.

394
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:07,670
Guys.

395
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,150
I'm sorry.

396
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,670
I don't remember where everything is.

397
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,010
Like...

398
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:10,550
Hahaha!

399
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,130
I don't!

400
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,390
I don't remember where I put my own stuff!

401
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,150
Ah!

402
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:16,850
Oh wait.

403
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,670
Is it this?

404
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,150
Is this one?

405
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,070
No.

406
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,390
I don't think it is.

407
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,430
Is it?

408
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,250
No.

409
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:25,230
What?

410
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,130
Where did I put it?

411
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,810
Oh!

412
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,630
I put it here!

413
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,830
Oh I'm so stupid!

414
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,070
Alright guys.

415
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,490
I figured it out.

416
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,130
Guys it's been a while.

417
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,930
Please be gentle.

418
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,370
Please be nice to me.

419
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,590
Hahaha!

420
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,130
It's been a while.

421
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,850
Please be nice to me.

422
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:42,990
Hahaha!

423
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,510
Okay.

424
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,070
Okay.

425
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,530
I don't know how loud this is gonna be so I'm sorry.

426
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,350
Whoa!

427
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,990
Was it loud?

428
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,010
I couldn't tell.

429
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,310
Um...

430
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,470
If it is I'm sorry.

431
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,110
How do I do this?

432
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,130
How loud is this?

433
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,510
Okay.

434
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:57,910
Um...

435
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,190
We're gonna put this right here.

436
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:01,850
Okay.

437
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,550
No.

438
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,070
Not here.

439
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,470
Alright.

440
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,390
We're gonna...

441
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:04,910
We're gonna...

442
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,690
Hahaha!

443
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:06,730
Hahaha!

444
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:09,670
Okay.

445
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,150
We're gonna...

446
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,030
We're gonna...

447
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,260
No.

448
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,110
I know.

449
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,030
I paused it.

450
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,990
I know it's muted guys.

451
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,250
I literally paused it.

452
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,050
Alright.

453
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,470
Is it this?

454
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:19,790
Okay.

455
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,230
There we go.

456
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:20,750
There we go.

457
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,290
This is...

458
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,450
This is what you get.

459
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,850
This is basically what you get.

460
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,770
Hahaha!

461
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,570
I'll put it down too.

462
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,390
Alright.

463
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,310
Anyway.

464
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,250
Um...

465
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,350
Hahaha!

466
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,070
You're gonna be...

467
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,990
Hahaha!

468
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,130
Okay.

469
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,770
Um...

470
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,130
As I was saying...

471
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,170
Um...

472
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,230
So yeah.

473
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,430
Moving has been...

474
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,110
Has been really tough.

475
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,170
Um...

476
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,930
I actually went to buy more boxes.

477
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,170
I went to buy...

478
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,810
Uh...

479
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,790
Boxes today.

480
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:53,970
Uh...

481
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,090
I actually went to buy more boxes.

482
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,170
Uh...

483
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,170
More boxes today.

484
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,710
Also...

485
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,050
Um...

486
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,610
Thank you for the Akasupa!

487
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,330
Thank you!

488
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:58,850
Thank you!

489
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,790
I'm still at work!

490
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,750
Thank you for the Akasupa!

491
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,190
Thank you!

492
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,670
Thank you!

493
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,290
Okay.

494
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,410
So like...

495
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:05,870
I...

496
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,130
I bought like...

497
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,290
I had to buy boxes at Home Depot.

498
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,570
Um...

499
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,510
And it was really tough.

500
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,530
Because like...

501
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,550
I had to get the boxes myself.

502
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:15,970
And...

503
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,630
Um...

504
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,210
And...

505
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,390
Oh yeah.

506
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,590
I forgot to put it on a loop.

507
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,150
Because it's gonna stop after this one.

508
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,950
Let me actually put it on a loop.

509
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,810
And...

510
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,610
And like...

511
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,070
I...

512
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,030
I called an Uber.

513
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:27,850
And...

514
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,690
I called an Uber.

515
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,830
And I was like...

516
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:30,910
Hey...

517
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,190
Um...

518
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,810
I didn't really...

519
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,810
I bought too much.

520
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,810
I bought...

521
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,570
No car...

522
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:35,830
Guys.

523
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,570
I have not driven a car...

524
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:38,890
In...

525
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,150
Six years.

526
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,570
No.

527
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,450
Six years.

528
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,050
I have my license.

529
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,490
I have not...

530
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,430
I do not think you should ever...

531
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,970
I...

532
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,250
I should not be behind the wheel.

533
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:52,690
I...

534
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:52,870
I...

535
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,790
I should not be behind the wheel.

536
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:53,910
I...

537
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,250
I...

538
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,570
I haven't...

539
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,210
I...

540
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,710
I have not touched the wheel in six plus years.

541
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,170
For the safety of everybody.

542
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,670
I should absolutely not be behind the car.

543
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,050
Like I...

544
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,090
So...

545
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,990
Um...

546
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,470
So I do have a license.

547
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,650
I just...

548
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,170
I choose not to drive.

549
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,390
Because it's been way too long.

550
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,070
For the safety of everybody on the road.

551
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,370
And not on the road.

552
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,310
So...

553
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,690
Background is very low.

554
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:32,890
Well...

555
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,170
Sorry but...

556
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,670
You're not here to listen to the BGM.

557
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,090
Like...

558
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,650
Like what do you mean?

559
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,150
I'm here...

560
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,650
I'm here to talk.

561
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,010
Like...

562
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,070
Anyway... Why is there chat?

563
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,450
You don't wanna be there?

564
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,490
Let me... Okay.

565
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,230
Anyway, anyway, so... It was awkward because like...

566
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,490
So I had to like, obviously, I had to hold the... I bought too many boxes.

567
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,650
And like, because like, fucking, I don't know.

568
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,290
I've never done all of this myself before.

569
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,730
And um... Quiet please, I'm trying to chat.

570
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:34,810
So like, I overestimated how well I can carry boxes.

571
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:41,370
Because like, because like, I don't know if you guys know this, but it's...

572
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,770
It's really big, the...

573
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:57,630
And like... So like, I couldn't hold it in like, two arms.

574
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,650
Like, I can't hold it in like, two arms.

575
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,970
And I bought way too many.

576
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,290
I was... Because like, you know, I had like a cart.

577
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,510
So I was like, you know, driving with my cart.

578
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,010
And like, put... And I was like, that doesn't seem too bad.

579
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,550
Um... And um...

580
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,850
And like...

581
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,370
And like... So obviously, when I loaded into the car...

582
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,290
Uh, by the way, I wasn't driving the car.

583
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,050
So don't worry, everybody was safe.

584
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:28,870
Uh...

585
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,250
And I was just like... First off, I was like, how do I fit this in the car?

586
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,730
Um, and... Because like... I was like, how do I fit it?

587
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,290
It's so long.

588
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,210
And then, we were just looking at it.

589
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,790
Like, me and the driver.

590
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:45,830
And then, we were just looking at it.

591
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,830
Like, me and the driver.

592
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,150
We were just looking at it and figuring it out.

593
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,010
And then, they're like, can I bend it?

594
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,910
And I was like, you can bend...

595
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,110
I'm so smart.

596
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,990
I like, texted my friend too.

597
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,190
I texted my friend.

598
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,610
I was like, I'm so smart.

599
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:05,770
If you bend the cardboard in half, it makes it smaller.

600
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,710
So that it would fit in the car trunk.

601
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,670
And I was like, oh my god.

602
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,910
I was just like...

603
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,730
I was like...

604
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,030
Because it's a giant cardboard.

605
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:18,890
Because it's flat.

606
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,630
And it's like, I bought the big ones.

607
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,210
And like... And I was like, oh my god.

608
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,470
And I was like...

609
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,230
And then, my friend was just like, so cute.

610
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,030
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

611
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,590
And I was like, oh my...

612
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,890
That's so much easier.

613
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,410
Because I was like, how am I going to carry this?

614
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,190
Like, it's so long.

615
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,790
I can't carry this.

616
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,310
And then the driver was like, oh, can I bend it to fit in the trunk?

617
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,090
I was like, it blew my mind.

618
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,630
It blew my mind.

619
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,610
It blew my mind.

620
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,050
I was just like, you can bend the cardboard.

621
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,210
Because that's what they're supposed to be used for.

622
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,330
You can bend it.

623
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,790
Anyway...

624
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,090
Anyway, after I realized you can bend the cardboard.

625
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,910
It was a lot easier to take back to the apartment.

626
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:10,950
It was...

627
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,270
So...

628
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,850
So there was that.

629
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,810
There was...

630
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,830
That happened...

631
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,510
Today.

632
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,730
Anyway, for those who weren't reading the waiting room chat.

633
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,990
Okay, this has looped enough.

634
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:29,570
Like...

635
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,790
This has looped enough.

636
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,110
That's enough.

637
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,470
That's all you guys get.

638
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,750
Anyway, so...

639
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,790
So I ordered fiber internet.

640
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,870
Because obviously I need fiber for my job.

641
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:46,930
And...

642
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,150
And like...

643
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:49,710
So...

644
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,430
For those who don't know, like, TELUS fiber...

645
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,130
Okay, let me...

646
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,010
I use TELUS, by the way.

647
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,610
Because in Canada, it's either TELUS or Rogers.

648
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,950
Because like...

649
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,130
You know, we...

650
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,290
We all know like internet com...

651
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,890
Like, unlike Australia.

652
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,630
Or I don't know if the New Zealand's like it too.

653
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,370
Or if they're like actually normal like the rest of us.

654
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,770
The government does not allow us to use fiber.

655
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,290
It doesn't own the internet company.

656
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,170
For like...

657
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,250
For all you Australians who don't know this.

658
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,050
The government doesn't own the internet.

659
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,990
Okay, who cares about Bell?

660
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,170
Nobody cares about Bell.

661
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,790
Like...

662
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,770
It's so irrelevant.

663
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,530
Because like...

664
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,430
Even like in price comparison...

665
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,130
It's always...

666
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,250
TELUS would be like...

667
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,010
Here's our prices compared to Rogers.

668
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,290
Because they don't think Bell exists.

669
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,750
They don't think Bell exists.

670
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,850
They don't think Bell is not like relevant to them.

671
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:45,850
Um...

672
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,650
I like how someone was like...

673
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,630
Bell is still around?

674
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,570
Like...

675
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,570
So...

676
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,570
Um...

677
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,750
So...

678
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,950
We have an option to have better internet.

679
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:57,850
Um...

680
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,210
Because the government doesn't control it.

681
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,290
Um...

682
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:06,330
And the package for fiber is pretty fucking crazy.

683
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,470
Because like...

684
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:07,990
Uh...

685
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,310
It's like...

686
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,030
There's...

687
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,450
Pure fiber.

688
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,910
Um...

689
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,050
There's like...

690
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,910
Pure fiber.

691
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,110
And then there's like...

692
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,190
There's like...

693
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,850
Fiber.

694
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,090
Uh...

695
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,130
And then there's pure fiber X.

696
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,790
And then I got the...

697
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,810
I don't remember what it's called.

698
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,350
It was like...

699
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,250
Some fucking...

700
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,670
It was like...

701
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,070
Some...

702
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,090
Ultra...

703
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,050
Ultra something something something.

704
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,330
I was like...

705
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,470
Why is that name so long?

706
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,090
I was like...

707
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,970
Why...

708
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,370
Why is...

709
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,830
Why is that such a fucking...

710
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,890
Long...

711
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,010
Long...

712
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,330
Long...

713
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:42,790
Name...

714
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,290
Long...

715
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:43,510
Name...

716
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,710
Let's see.

717
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,370
Let me...

718
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,970
Let me see the package title.

719
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,090
Um...

720
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,690
Oh, my gosh.

721
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,330
Where is it?

722
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:50,570
Okay.

723
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,610
Fiber.

724
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,670
Teleteles.

725
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,710
Package.

726
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,390
Where's the pictures for it?

727
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,870
Where's the pictures?

728
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,570
Okay.

729
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,530
Package.

730
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,710
Uh...

731
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,930
Was it Ultra Mega Fiber X?

732
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,330
I was like...

733
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,690
Trying to find the packages.

734
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,010
Because I want...

735
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,410
Okay.

736
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:08,950
Okay, what's this?

737
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,050
No, it's not that.

738
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:10,730
Alright.

739
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,310
Where was it?

740
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,210
What was it called?

741
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,290
Any like, telus people know what it was called?

742
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,550
Because I don't remember.

743
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,790
I don't remember.

744
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,310
I was looking it up because I was like, Do I do that?

745
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,670
Do I...

746
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:26,850
Do I...

747
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,990
Do I get that internet?

748
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,430
Like I was just like, do I...

749
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,190
I mean it was like $20 more.

750
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,610
So I was just like, I mean...

751
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,730
It was...

752
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,030
Oh, it's PureFiberX Internet.

753
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,210
I'm like, okay, so...

754
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,750
Because it's 3x.

755
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,290
And the thing about it is that...

756
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,070
The other ones are like a thousand.

757
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,610
Or a thousand upload, download.

758
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,450
And the package I got was...

759
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,950
3000 upload and download.

760
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,630
Oh yeah, sorry, Internet 3G.

761
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,210
I forgot.

762
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,710
It's PureFiberX Internet 3G.

763
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,590
So it's...

764
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,230
I call it UltraFiber.

765
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,430
Because...

766
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,810
Basically, I call it UltraFiber.

767
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,290
Because it's 3000 uploads.

768
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,930
And 3000 downloads.

769
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:29,610
And then the other plans, the other package deals are like, Oh, you can connect like 20 devices and stuff.

770
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,450
And everything.

771
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,970
And then the other one was like, Oh, you can connect like 6 to 12 devices.

772
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,590
And the PureFiberX Internet 3G...

773
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,690
They're like, you can connect 100 devices.

774
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,650
And I was like, oh my God.

775
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,590
What am I going to do with 100 devices?

776
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:56,390
I was like, what am I going to do with 100 plus devices?

777
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,470
I was like, okay.

778
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:05,510
But 100 plus devices can connect to my Internet.

779
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,030
And...

780
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,770
So that's why.

781
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,430
Probably it's for businesses but I was like, you know what?

782
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,770
What if?

783
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,870
I'm just saying.

784
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,410
It was $20 more.

785
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:22,990
Okay.

786
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,310
All I was saying was the reason why I paid.

787
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,370
I mean.

788
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,750
I mean, it was a 1000 or 3000.

789
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,770
And the whole reason.

790
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,110
The reason why I... I was like it's only $20 more!

791
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,430
It's $20 more for 3k?

792
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,010
Like that shit is... I mean, come on!

793
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,270
What a fucking deal!

794
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,290
Like...

795
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,070
Like, what a deal!

796
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,610
Nobody else is allowed to use it except for me.

797
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,330
But like...

798
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:04,270
All I'm saying was that... I don't know if I'll ever need 3k uploads or downloads.

799
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,790
But, like, what if something happens?

800
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:18,330
What if I needed to download a 100GB game and I had 10 minutes to do it?

801
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,670
Like, what if?

802
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,370
I'll be prepared!

803
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:23,970
Exactly!

804
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,190
I'll always be prepared for it!

805
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,630
And it's a business expense!

806
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,030
It's literally for my job!

807
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:29,770
So...

808
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,050
Like, what if?

809
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:33,850
Exactly!

810
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,150
I could technically stream in 4k!

811
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,490
But I won't do it!

812
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,330
I could technically do it!

813
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,530
But I won't!

814
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,730
But I like that there is an option.

815
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,610
I like that I have the option to do it!

816
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,490
It is a business expense!

817
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,110
It's literally my job!

818
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,510
We love tax write-offs here!

819
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:03,710
Um...

820
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:05,690
Thomas!

821
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,750
Thank you for the super chat!

822
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,110
Thank you!

823
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,250
Oh, look at that loser!

824
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,010
Good morning, Doki!

825
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,490
I am Thomas, the poor one in ACGHK!

826
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,190
Love you!

827
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,010
Thank you for the super chat!

828
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,350
Thank you!

829
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,450
Alright, for those who don't understand who Thomas is...

830
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,930
Um... I played Apex...

831
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,310
For... with like... some of the dragoons in Hong Kong.

832
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,110
And... um...

833
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,110
Um... we were picking some dragoons randomly.

834
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,090
Um... and they were playing with us.

835
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,010
Thomas here was like...

836
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,830
Yeah, I'm good at the game.

837
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,830
So I was like... Alright, Thomas!

838
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,170
I was like... Alright!

839
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,450
Let's see how you do!

840
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,430
Um... needless to say...

841
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,250
Thomas sort of... you know...

842
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,550
Apparently, he was a controller player.

843
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,690
Forced to play on MNK.

844
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,750
So...

845
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:04,970
So...

846
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,970
So...

847
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,810
Um... we weren't even...

848
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,950
I found out later on... he was a controller player.

849
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,010
That unfortunately, we didn't have any controllers at the premises.

850
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,670
So... yeah.

851
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,290
So it was an unlucky day for Thomas when it came to like...

852
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,310
Playing in front of everybody.

853
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,350
And then... you know...

854
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,010
He got...

855
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,690
He got roasted!

856
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,950
A little bit.

857
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,370
Just a little bit, guys.

858
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,550
I didn't make him cry.

859
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,230
Um... and he liked it.

860
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,070
So like...

861
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,210
In the end... like... we're all winners here.

862
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,470
Um...

863
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,890
So everybody won in the end.

864
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,990
Because is it really... like... is it really fucked up?

865
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,250
If Thomas liked it in the end?

866
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,130
All... that's all I'm saying...

867
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,170
It will hold up in court, by the way.

868
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,210
This will hold up in court.

869
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,950
Like...

870
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:57,570
Alright.

871
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,150
Let me munch on my sandwich.

872
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,210
I got sandwiched because it was like the fastest...

873
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,450
Um... the fastest thing to get here.

874
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,270
So...

875
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,550
I won't say what type of sandwich because I don't want to fucking dox myself.

876
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:09,990
So...

877
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,930
I'm trying to find a very... specific sandwich.

878
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,050
Um...

879
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:21,830
Hi, Drake.

880
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,590
I haven't talked this much in a long time.

881
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,150
Sorry.

882
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,670
Um... I haven't talked this much in a while.

883
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,650
So like... I need...

884
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,310
My throat is just like...

885
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,270
What the fuck are you doing?

886
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:32,890
Like...

887
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,790
They're like...

888
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,490
Please...

889
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,310
Hydrate.

890
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,490
What are you doing, Dokie?

891
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,930
Fucking hydrate.

892
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,170
But I really miss streaming though.

893
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,510
I really, really do.

894
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,750
It's... it's been a mess.

895
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,210
Um... I remember like... I had to...

896
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,230
Um... I tried to find boxes.

897
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,350
The reason why I bought boxes so late was because...

898
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,050
I had a huge problem trying to fucking...

899
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:53,650
I don't know why!

900
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,170
It's so hard to find moving boxes.

901
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,490
Um...

902
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,290
Close to me.

903
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,450
And...

904
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,490
The reason... I was trying to find...

905
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,730
Like... moving boxes.

906
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,350
And the closest thing...

907
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,770
I went to Walmart first.

908
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,970
Because like...

909
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,470
Walmart sells moving boxes.

910
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,690
It's literally on their website.

911
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,190
And I was... I... I was so tired.

912
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,130
I like walked there.

913
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,370
Because I was like...

914
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,890
I don't wanna... I don't wanna take an Uber.

915
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,950
Like... I don't wanna take an Uber.

916
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,450
So... I was like...

917
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,390
Okay, I'm gonna...

918
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,630
I'm gonna walk to Walmart.

919
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,010
And...

920
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,190
I was so tired.

921
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:26,890
That...

922
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,690
In the middle of walking to Walmart...

923
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,370
I passed by an ice cream store.

924
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,650
So... like...

925
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,210
And my staff team was helping me out with the move and everything.

926
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,090
Um...

927
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,110
Because they were much more experienced with like...

928
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,030
Moving and stuff.

929
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,050
And I'm not.

930
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,570
Like...

931
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,370
Not on my own.

932
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,090
And they like doing it on my own.

933
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,010
Um...

934
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,470
So like...

935
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,730
My staff team was helping me.

936
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,750
With like...

937
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,170
Some of...

938
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,890
Some of the stuff that was going on.

939
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,010
And...

940
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,690
Um...

941
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,170
And...

942
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,550
Because they're like much older than me.

943
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,970
And so they have like...

944
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,810
Actual experience.

945
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,650
Because they're old.

946
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,370
Uh...

947
00:29:59,460 --> 00:29:59,960
Like...

948
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,760
Um...

949
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,980
Which is a compliment.

950
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,080
The older you are...

951
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,680
The more wisdom you have.

952
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,000
And...

953
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,400
Uh...

954
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,440
So...

955
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,520
In the middle...

956
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,100
They were like...

957
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,800
How's it go...

958
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,000
Like...

959
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,760
Because they were like trying to help me find like places to get moving boxes.

960
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:13,980
And...

961
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,540
So...

962
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,520
I was like...

963
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,000
You can't say...

964
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,420
Yes, I can.

965
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,040
Because I literally paid their...

966
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,640
Wages.

967
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,440
So...

968
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,760
I shouldn't say that.

969
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,160
Like...

970
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,600
That's so fucked up.

971
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,300
I'm sorry.

972
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,640
I should...

973
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,180
Stop it.

974
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:28,820
I'm so...

975
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:28,920
I'mop...

976
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,240
Please...

977
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,120
Please don't...

978
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,740
Um...

979
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,580
Please...

980
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,560
Please continue the work for me.

981
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,320
Um...

982
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,340
Anyways.

983
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
I didn't mean that.

984
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,260
I didn't mean that.

985
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:46,860
Um...

986
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
Anyway.

987
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,420
I was joking.

988
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,060
I was...

989
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,640
Joking.

990
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,560
Anyways...

991
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:54,600
Alright...

992
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,620
Anyway, as I was saying, they were like, how's it going?

993
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,980
And then I literally was like...

994
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,620
I literally was like...

995
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,660
I was like...

996
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,300
They texted...

997
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,100
Not texted, they Discord messaged, like, how's it going?

998
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,160
Did you find the boxes?

999
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,400
Cause you know, I sort of stayed at the ice cream place for like 30 minutes.

1000
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:22,540
And I literally wrote back, sorry I'm at the ice cream store cause I'm dead inside.

1001
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,250
And they were like, understandable.

1002
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,650
It was really hot!

1003
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:35,870
Okay?

1004
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,330
It was really hot!

1005
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:45,370
So I was there for like 30 minutes cause I just needed the break, okay?

1006
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,650
And...

1007
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,190
Cause they expected me to already... would have bought the boxes already.

1008
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,590
Because I was gone for like a long time.

1009
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,390
But...

1010
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,530
Instead I was at the ice cream store, like, eating my ice cream.

1011
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,270
Anyway, back onto the main quest.

1012
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,970
Getting the fucking boxes at Walmart.

1013
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,890
Dude, okay, I don't care!

1014
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,350
Fuck Walmart!

1015
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,470
I was like, no Dokie!

1016
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:18,570
You're gonna lose a potential sponsor with Walmart.

1017
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,330
If I'm willing to cut any cord...

1018
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,450
If I'm willing to cut any fucking cord...

1019
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,850
Any connection to any corporation...

1020
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,390
It will be fucking Walmart.

1021
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,790
Cause fuck Walmart!

1022
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,110
For what they did to me.

1023
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:42,050
And the reason why I'm passionate about my hate towards Walmart...

1024
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,690
Is because...

1025
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,770
I was sent on the fucking wildest goose chase...

1026
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,170
Trying to find moving boxes.

1027
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,710
No one knew where the moving boxes were!

1028
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,530
I was sent everywhere!

1029
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,430
I was sent everywhere!

1030
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,950
I was like, I asked six different people for boxes!

1031
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,190
But it was on their website!

1032
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,630
It was literally on their website!

1033
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,410
You can pick it up today!

1034
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,950
That's what it says on the website!

1035
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,330
So like...

1036
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,550
I'll be like, hi, I'm looking for moving boxes.

1037
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,670
And they're like, oh, um, sorry, I don't know.

1038
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,050
Maybe it's like...

1039
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,750
Maybe it's in the home area.

1040
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,090
So I was like, okay.

1041
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,430
And I walked around, I swear to God, I walked around the goddamn wall.

1042
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,090
I walked around Walmart for like...

1043
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,550
For almost like...

1044
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,990
An hour and a half!

1045
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,910
Trying to find the fucking boxes!

1046
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,470
And then I like...

1047
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,330
Walked around and I kept going...

1048
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,590
And then I asked another person.

1049
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,390
And they're like, oh, maybe it's like...

1050
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,230
Downstairs.

1051
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,350
Maybe it's like...

1052
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,330
On the...

1053
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,990
Maybe it's on the first floor instead of the third floor.

1054
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,610
And I was like, oh, okay.

1055
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,250
I'll check the first floor out.

1056
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,210
And I walked around.

1057
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,990
And I asked another person.

1058
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,470
They're like, oh, wait, I think it's like...

1059
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,010
At the hardware section.

1060
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,390
And like, you basically go up to the...

1061
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,150
Second floor.

1062
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,230
And...

1063
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:10,690
And...

1064
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:11,810
And...

1065
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,310
Turn that way and then go to the hardware section.

1066
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,630
And I looked at the hardware section.

1067
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,670
There were no fucking boxes!

1068
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,410
There was...

1069
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,350
There was...

1070
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,650
Bubble wrap.

1071
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,670
There was bubble wrap.

1072
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,650
There was tape.

1073
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,250
But no boxes!

1074
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,690
And I was like, oh, maybe I fucked up.

1075
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,390
You know?

1076
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,410
I was like, maybe...

1077
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,470
Maybe...

1078
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,090
I fucked up.

1079
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,270
Cause like, I always fuck up.

1080
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,650
So, you know, I was like...

1081
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,330
Could a big...

1082
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,010
Conglomerate...

1083
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,530
God, words.

1084
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,650
Could a big multi-billion dollar company...

1085
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,950
Really not have...

1086
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,630
Fucking moving parts?

1087
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,870
That says on their website...

1088
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,030
That they have moving boxes...

1089
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,250
That can be picked up today?

1090
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,250
Cause I checked on the website...

1091
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,690
And it was like, you can pick up these moving boxes...

1092
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,010
Today!

1093
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,210
And I was like, oh, today.

1094
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,610
Like...

1095
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,570
Oh, today!

1096
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,910
Cause I was like, why wait...

1097
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,350
To order it online...

1098
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,530
If I can just go there and pick it up...

1099
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,010
Right now.

1100
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,450
So...

1101
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,950
Anyway...

1102
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,790
I was like...

1103
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,050
I walked...

1104
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,110
I walked around!

1105
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,530
I walked around!

1106
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,010
I walked around!

1107
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,470
For a very long time!

1108
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,830
Because I kept thinking...

1109
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,050
It's my fault!

1110
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,110
It's fucking my fault!

1111
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,130
And finally, after asking 5 plus people...

1112
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,250
I found the 6th guy.

1113
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,810
And I was like...

1114
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,190
Okay, the 6th guy was the 5th guy.

1115
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,570
By the way, I found the same guy again.

1116
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,110
Cause he was the most confident.

1117
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,210
About...

1118
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,650
He was literally the...

1119
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,830
Cause he actually gave me directions.

1120
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,790
So...

1121
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,390
I was like...

1122
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,410
Okay, I'm gonna ask this guy...

1123
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,670
The 5th guy again.

1124
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,250
Because he literally actually gave me...

1125
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,990
Real fucking directions.

1126
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,010
On where the boxes were.

1127
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,710
And so...

1128
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,190
So...

1129
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,510
I was like...

1130
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,430
Hey, I walked there!

1131
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,630
I walked to that specific section you told me.

1132
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,810
And there's no boxes!

1133
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,430
And then he was like...

1134
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,210
Oh really?

1135
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,590
Okay, let me call them.

1136
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,990
And I was like...

1137
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,530
Yeah, I checked the Walmart website.

1138
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,630
And that's why I came here.

1139
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,990
At this particular store.

1140
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,290
Because it said I could pick up...

1141
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,150
Boxes today.

1142
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,690
Cause you have them in stock.

1143
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,850
And then that man straight up told me...

1144
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,030
That fucking man...

1145
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,090
It's not his fault!

1146
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,150
But still...

1147
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,330
Like...

1148
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,390
He's...

1149
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,110
He paid minimum wage!

1150
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,550
But still...

1151
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,370
I'm sorry!

1152
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,630
This is why I'm being...

1153
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,450
A minimum wage worker fucking sucks.

1154
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,770
Cause I was so angry.

1155
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,610
But I did not direct my anger towards him.

1156
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,930
He was like...

1157
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,010
He was like...

1158
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:17,930
Yeah...

1159
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:18,810
That doesn't mean today.

1160
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,170
I was like...

1161
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,670
Why did he say pick up today?

1162
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,610
He literally was like...

1163
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,030
Sorry, that doesn't...

1164
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,930
On the website it doesn't mean today.

1165
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,950
And I was just like...

1166
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,650
And they're like...

1167
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,450
Yeah, if you place an order...

1168
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,690
Then we actually don't have it in stock.

1169
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,070
They'll just change the pick up date for another time.

1170
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,110
And then...

1171
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,750
They'll send you an email and be like...

1172
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,570
Sorry, you're gonna pick it up at this date...

1173
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,410
I'm like...

1174
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,510
They say it!

1175
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,190
Just put it on the website!

1176
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,530
What if it was an emergency?

1177
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,610
What if I ordered something...

1178
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,510
At Walmart...

1179
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,450
I don't know...

1180
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,190
What if my backyard...

1181
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,590
Was filled with deadly mold...

1182
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,290
And I went to the Walmart...

1183
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,210
To pick up pesticides...

1184
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,270
Cause I need it today.

1185
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,570
Cause if I don't...

1186
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,750
I'm gonna get cancer or something.

1187
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,510
I don't know, it's fucking dead black mold.

1188
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,550
I'm like...

1189
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,290
What if it was black mold?

1190
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,250
In my house?

1191
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,490
And like...

1192
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,870
I need it now!

1193
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,430
And I saw...

1194
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,450
Walmart has the materials that I need...

1195
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,670
For it.

1196
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,450
And I pick today!

1197
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,590
Pick up today!

1198
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,130
It's already too late.

1199
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,210
Like...

1200
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,570
Okay...

1201
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,810
Anyway...

1202
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:44,970
Um...

1203
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,170
I was so mad.

1204
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,790
I was so mad!

1205
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:52,210
I was like...

1206
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,670
Why would you lie about that?

1207
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,950
Why the fuck...

1208
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,650
Why the fuck did you lie?

1209
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,230
Why the fuck does Walmart lie about today?

1210
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,830
It could have been a fucking emergency!

1211
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,950
But it wasn't.

1212
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,890
Because I went to Home Depot the other day.

1213
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:07,790
So...

1214
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,070
So the next day I went to Home Depot cause clearly it was an emergency.

1215
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,450
But it could have been!

1216
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,570
That's the thing!

1217
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,570
It could have been an emergency!

1218
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,770
Because Walmart is right today!

1219
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,310
Okay, sorry.

1220
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:19,650
Anyway...

1221
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:20,730
Anyway...

1222
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,790
He was like...

1223
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,510
Yeah...

1224
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,690
Today was a lie.

1225
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:30,870
So...

1226
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,390
Anyway...

1227
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,010
They were like...

1228
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,090
Um...

1229
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,830
They were like...

1230
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,710
Yeah, that's not true.

1231
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,330
It's not today.

1232
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,650
We don't have it and stuff.

1233
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,230
We just put it there just in case we do have it and stuff.

1234
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,170
So...

1235
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,750
They called...

1236
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,150
Oh yeah, we don't have a Target in Canada because they went bankrupt.

1237
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,650
I don't know how it's fucking Target.

1238
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,450
Like I don't know!

1239
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,630
We got one!

1240
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:58,110
Like I don't know how the fuck Target went bankrupt in Canada!

1241
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,570
Because we still have Toys R Us!

1242
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,130
For some reason, Toys R Us went bankrupt in America!

1243
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,950
But we haven't!

1244
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,270
But yet, we don't have a fucking Target!

1245
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,850
Like how?!

1246
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,950
It's convenient!

1247
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,750
It's convenient!

1248
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,240
How the fuck does Toys R Us stay alive?

1249
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,540
But not Target!

1250
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,420
We don't have enough children for Toys R Us!

1251
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,440
Like, I don't understand!

1252
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,800
We don't have enough children!

1253
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,480
We have a lower population than America!

1254
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,920
Yet somehow...

1255
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,620
Our population is sustaining the Toys R Us in the country!

1256
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,240
Our population is sustaining the Toys R Us in the country!

1257
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,460
Uh...

1258
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,940
It makes no sense!

1259
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,340
Anyway...

1260
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,120
Um...

1261
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,640
Sorry, anyway...

1262
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,800
There's a lot of things I'm mad about!

1263
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,060
There's a lot of things!

1264
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,240
Uh...

1265
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,900
Um...

1266
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,700
Uh...

1267
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,440
Anyway...

1268
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,600
So anyway...

1269
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,020
The guy... The fifth slash sixth guy...

1270
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,600
Fifth guy part two...

1271
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,620
Called the like...

1272
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,280
I guess the inventory people...

1273
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,400
And uh...

1274
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,360
What grinds... You know what grinds my gears?

1275
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,000
So...

1276
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,700
Um...

1277
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,840
Um...

1278
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,860
Um...

1279
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,740
The fifth guy part two...

1280
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,340
Called the inventory person...

1281
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,580
And was like...

1282
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,700
Sorry, we don't have any boxes...

1283
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,420
We don't have...

1284
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,760
It's out of stock...

1285
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,440
And I was like...

1286
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,720
Oh my... This entire time it was fucking out of stock...

1287
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,180
I've been trapped in this Walmart for like...

1288
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,500
An hour and a half...

1289
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,280
And all along it was out of stock... I'm tired!

1290
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,880
I walked so long to get here...

1291
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,600
To this specific Walmart...

1292
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,560
And it was out of stock...

1293
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,460
The website lied to me...

1294
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,720
I could've been at Home Depot...

1295
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,920
I chose Walmart cause it was...

1296
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,620
Closer!

1297
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,060
I could've...

1298
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,960
I could've been at Home Depot!

1299
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,000
Anyway...

1300
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,380
Um...

1301
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,320
Um... So... Yeah...

1302
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,980
So the trip was... I mean I wouldn't say the trip...

1303
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,380
Was like a failure...

1304
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,440
Because I did get ice cream in the end... Like...

1305
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,360
I did... I did...

1306
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,940
In the middle of the quest I got ice cream...

1307
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,340
So like... There's that...

1308
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,620
Also... I was...

1309
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,940
It added to my anger...

1310
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,760
Another reason why I was angry...

1311
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,680
Was because I bought... There was like a...

1312
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,240
Not Toys R Us by the way...

1313
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,780
There was like a toy store...

1314
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,820
Like a collector toy store...

1315
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,300
Nearby... And I checked it out...

1316
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,260
Cause I haven't been there in a long time...

1317
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,900
Cause I really... I wanted to see if they still had...

1318
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,760
This specific figure that I really really like...

1319
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,640
Um... Let me see what it's called...

1320
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,580
Um...

1321
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,420
Let me see if I can remember what it's called...

1322
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,860
Uh... Because it is a...

1323
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,920
It's really cute... I really love...

1324
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,280
The... Uh...

1325
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,220
I really love the... Uh...

1326
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,940
The brand... Because like...

1327
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,100
I thought it was like really really cute...

1328
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,360
I'm gonna try and find a picture of it real quick right now...

1329
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,300
Give me a sec... Cause I need you guys...

1330
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,460
Cause like... I got mad...

1331
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,300
I got mad...

1332
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,520
There's so many things...

1333
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,140
I did... I had a really...

1334
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,520
Rough week... Okay... I had a...

1335
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,160
Really rough week...

1336
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,820
It was... It was a lot of things...

1337
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,260
That made me mad...

1338
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,540
The past week... But like...

1339
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,660
This one... I was... I'm just...

1340
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,220
I'll just say it... Like...

1341
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,940
There's a lot of things that happened I couldn't really talk about...

1342
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,820
Publicly... But like...

1343
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,540
It's not like business related...

1344
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,380
It's more so like personal related...

1345
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,260
Um...

1346
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,040
And like... I...

1347
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,480
Had so many unlucky...

1348
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,140
Things happen to me...

1349
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,940
In the past week...

1350
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,440
It was absolutely fucking crazy...

1351
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,860
I was like... How do I...

1352
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,300
I was like... How is this still happening?

1353
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,180
How is this still fucking happening?

1354
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,660
Like...

1355
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,540
Um... I mean there was like...

1356
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,220
Unlucky business stuff too... Like losing my fucking...

1357
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,880
Fortnite creator code...

1358
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,340
Um... I'll talk about that story later...

1359
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,180
But um...

1360
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,640
I need to show you guys...

1361
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,960
Why... This particular...

1362
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,800
Um...

1363
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,260
Toy store... The...

1364
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,300
The collector toy store...

1365
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,540
Made me mad...

1366
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,280
I...

1367
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,640
I've just been...

1368
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,440
Because I've been so unlucky!

1369
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,920
I don't understand!

1370
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:26,980
I don't understand!

1371
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,100
Like... I'm sorry...

1372
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,360
My voice is definitely not used to talking for so long...

1373
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,280
My voice is definitely not used to talking for so long...

1374
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,800
I've just... I've been so fucking unlucky!

1375
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,980
What is it called?

1376
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,800
Okay... I need to find it...

1377
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,860
Oh my god...

1378
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,700
I can't remember like...

1379
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,000
The name of... Is this the brand?

1380
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,940
Is it... Oh!

1381
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,180
Oh!

1382
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,800
It is!

1383
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,300
Okay... Okay...

1384
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,080
The brand is called... Is it What The Bird?

1385
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,360
Do they have the other ones?

1386
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,120
Okay...

1387
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,780
What the... What...

1388
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,440
What The Bird... I think that's what it's called...

1389
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,540
I'm gonna try and find...

1390
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,980
The series... Okay... So...

1391
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,940
I really love their...

1392
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,920
Uh... Their bird...

1393
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,580
Their collection...

1394
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,800
Because it's super cute...

1395
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,080
I think like... I'm trying to see...

1396
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,160
Oh!

1397
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,260
It's called Love Bird!

1398
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:16,680
Oh!

1399
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,800
It's called Love Bird!

1400
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,680
Not What The Bird...

1401
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,120
That's like one of their collections...

1402
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,260
Um... It's called Love Bird...

1403
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,880
And it's super cute...

1404
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,440
But they did something that made me so angry...

1405
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,120
But it's not because of them...

1406
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,980
I just wanted to reiterate...

1407
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,800
It's not because of them...

1408
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,040
It's...

1409
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,960
It's because...

1410
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,500
Okay... Love Bird Collection...

1411
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,200
Figures... Where is it?

1412
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,700
Where's that spec... Is it called Love...

1413
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,720
Okay... It is...

1414
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,000
Okay... It's Love Bird Series...

1415
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,160
Okay... So... The reason being...

1416
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,860
Is that I'll show you guys the collection...

1417
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,240
I'll show...

1418
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,120
I'll show you guys the collection...

1419
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,520
And I really...

1420
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,620
There was one that I really really wanted...

1421
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,620
And...

1422
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,200
Obviously I didn't get it... But...

1423
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,380
If I did get it...

1424
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,460
I wouldn't be mad...

1425
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,480
So...

1426
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,200
So... This is the collection...

1427
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,060
This is...

1428
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,080
This is the collection...

1429
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,500
And I wanted the bad...

1430
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Bad birdie... Because I thought I was...

1431
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,980
I thought he was so fucking cool...

1432
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,700
I wanted...

1433
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,540
I wanted the... I wanted the bad...

1434
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,900
Bad birdie...

1435
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,440
And... The thing is...

1436
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,980
I didn't realize...

1437
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
That I had this in stock...

1438
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,040
Because... The first time I bought this...

1439
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,020
Was...

1440
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,360
Five months ago...

1441
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,160
Or was it four?

1442
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,180
It was either four or five months ago...

1443
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,300
And I got...

1444
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
I got poor guy bird...

1445
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,180
So obviously...

1446
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,540
Poor guy bird was pretty cool too...

1447
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,760
Five months passed!

1448
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:03,480
Five months passed!

1449
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,540
You see where I'm going?

1450
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,500
Yeah...

1451
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,060
Five months passed!

1452
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,540
I saw they still had them!

1453
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,520
I saw this particular toy collection store.

1454
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,240
They were still selling them.

1455
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:38,000
And I was like, oh, I don't mind getting any of the other six other figures in this collection.

1456
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,680
I grabbed a random box.

1457
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,960
I opened it as I went out of the store.

1458
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,260
Right the moment I went out of the store.

1459
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,540
Like, just bought it and just went out.

1460
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,600
It was poor Godford.

1461
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,300
Five months later.

1462
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,620
How?

1463
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,470
How?

1464
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,610
I literally waited five months.

1465
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,570
How unlucky can I be?

1466
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:17,310
Anyway, I was like, I've been really unlucky the past week.

1467
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:25,770
And I managed to get a double five months later.

1468
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,290
Which I was like, how is that possible?

1469
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,910
There's seven!

1470
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:32,730
There's seven!

1471
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,390
The thing about...

1472
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,650
Okay, you know like what's the craziest thing?

1473
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,770
If you guys never collect like Asian gachas.

1474
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:40,810
You know, toys before.

1475
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,070
When you buy from...

1476
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,130
Because it's all in like...

1477
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,650
They have like a box, right?

1478
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,090
They have a big box.

1479
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:52,370
And the big box...

1480
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,550
Has one of each.

1481
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,090
There's no special rates.

1482
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,410
That's the most messed up part.

1483
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,790
Like, it's one of one.

1484
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:04,170
So every box you pick up, it's a different figure.

1485
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,550
How the fuck did I...

1486
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:13,430
There's literally no doubles in the boxes.

1487
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,290
And they're not random.

1488
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,250
I just somehow...

1489
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:18,970
I didn't even pick

1490
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,680
the middle.

1491
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,680
And just...

1492
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,800
Yeah, it's...

1493
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,140
Sorry, it's sad.

1494
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,340
There's no gacha rates.

1495
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,840
There's literally no gacha rates.

1496
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,300
It's literally...

1497
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,520
It's literally...

1498
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,560
If you buy the entire collection from the box itself.

1499
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,520
You get everything.

1500
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,160
You get every single figure.

1501
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,940
In there.

1502
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,800
So somehow...

1503
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,260
I managed to get the same one.

1504
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,960
So...

1505
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,320
That made me mad too.

1506
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,800
This was before Walmart.

1507
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,520
So...

1508
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:03,160
This was before...

1509
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,340
This was...

1510
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,100
This was before Walmart.

1511
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,260
So...

1512
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,900
Yeah.

1513
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,300
So that's why...

1514
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,520
That's why I've been very unlucky.

1515
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,000
There's like so many other unlucky stuff that happened to me.

1516
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,120
But like this was one of those moments.

1517
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,880
This was...

1518
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,220
This was...

1519
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,680
This was one of them.

1520
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,520
This series...

1521
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,340
It was definitely a series of very, very unfortunate events.

1522
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,100
That happened to me.

1523
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,520
The past week.

1524
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:39,740
Yeah.

1525
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,580
So...

1526
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,080
Yeah.

1527
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,640
That's been...

1528
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,500
That's been my week.

1529
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,400
I mean there's other stuff that's happened.

1530
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,080
There's other stuff that's happened.

1531
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,820
There's so many things that happened in the world too.

1532
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,120
Like the Olympics.

1533
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,620
JP, thank you for the Akka Supa.

1534
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:50,960

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,160
Also thank you everybody for the super chats and the memberships.

00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,440

Thank you.

1544
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,880
I really miss streaming though.

1545
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,400

1546
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,520
I definitely miss like chatting with you guys.

1547
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,860
And venting a little.

1548
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,320
Like...

1549
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,380
Oh my god.

1550
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,320
Oh my god.

1551
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:12,860
Okay.

1552
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,500
Oh.

1553
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,820
What a funny...

1554
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,040
Okay.

1555
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,640
It wasn't funny.

1556
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,940
Cause like I felt really bad.

1557
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:17,640
Cause like...

1558
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,360
Um...

1559
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,420
It was like...

1560
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,040
I suppose...

1561
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,780
There was like...

1562
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,460
So...

1563
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,040
Um...

1564
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,000
So like I'm a guest.

1565
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:27,900
Um...

1566
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,440
Guest at Yuusan's concert.

1567
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,640
And we're discussing about like...

1568
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,040
What to do.

1569
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:33,920
And when...

1570
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,900
In the intermission.

1571
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,140
And...

1572
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,480
Um...

1573
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,760
And then they were like...

1574
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,120
Oh!

1575
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,040
Joki, can you like...

1576
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,000
Teach Yuusan some...

1577
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,480
Some...

1578
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:43,800
Um...

1579
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,500
Hong Kong Cantonese slang.

1580
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,880
And I was like...

1581
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,780
I don't...

1582
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,200
I...

1583
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,180
I'm sorry.

1584
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,580
I don't...

1585
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,520
I don't...

1586
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,740
I was like...

1587
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,180
I...

1588
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,720
I'm sorry but I don't...

1589
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,280
I don't...

1590
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:54,720
I don't...

1591
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,860
No...

1592
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,040
I was like...

1593
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,540
I didn't...

1594
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,380
I...

1595
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,700
I lived in Canada.

1596
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,160
For the first...

1597
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,880
10 years of my life.

1598
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,640
I'm so...

1599
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,920
I'm so...

1600
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,780
And...

1601
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,740
Because like...

1602
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,320
It was so funny because...

1603
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:13,460
I was like...

1604
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,340
Yuusan was like...

1605
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:14,720
Oh yeah!

1606
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,340
Like you know...

1607
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:15,920
Similar to...

1608
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,560
This word.

1609
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,700
I was like...

1610
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,040
What's that word?

1611
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,140
I was like...

1612
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:22,800
I'm sorry.

1613
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,680
I don't know what that means.

1614
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:25,620
And...

1615
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,560
And then...

1616
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,160
And then...

1617
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,280
Um...

1618
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,660
And then...

1619
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,380
And then...

1620
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,380
And then...

1621
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:33,960
And I was like...

1622
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,740
Um...

1623
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,240
I know one...

1624
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,280
I literally only...

1625
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,160
Know...

1626
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,040
One...

1627
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,260
Like one slang.

1628
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,660
And it was like...

1629
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,360
San cha siu hou ge san lei.

1630
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:43,440
And then...

1631
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,100
I was like...

1632
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,800
I don't know man.

1633
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,680
That feels too trauma dumpy.

1634
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,080
Like...

1635
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,840
I was like...

1636
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,360
I...

1637
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,140
Because...

1638
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,540
What that means...

1639
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:51,980
Is that...

1640
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,560
That's when your...

1641
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,180
Your mom would tell you this.

1642
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,560
And it means...

1643
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,780
Giving birth to...

1644
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,500
A...

1645
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,920
Giving birth to pork...

1646
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,540
Is better than...

1647
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,420
Giving birth to you.

1648
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,000
And I was like...

1649
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,880
I don't know if I should...

1650
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,740
Teach that.

1651
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,100
Like...

1652
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,680
I don't...

1653
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,680
I don't...

1654
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:10,820
So...

1655
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,440
So that was scrapped.

1656
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,400
Because I was like...

1657
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,440
I don't know...

1658
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,560
I don't feel...

1659
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,320
I'm barely...

1660
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,520
I'm barely a student, let alone a teacher.

1661
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,000
So...

1662
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,100
So...

1663
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,300
Yeah.

1664
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,180
I was like...

1665
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:31,820
I was like...

1666
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,400
I...

1667
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,460
I don't think we should...

1668
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,540
I don't think you should do any games where I have to teach you anything.

1669
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,620
Because like...

1670
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,180
I...

1671
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,840
I'm barely...

1672
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,800
I'm barely...

1673
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,380
We are surviving on English alone.

1674
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,100
Let alone other languages.

1675
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:59,780
Oh yeah, one of them was that, oh, why don't you teach us nursery rhymes?

1676
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,360
We could do something easy like London Bridge is falling down.

1677
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,020
And I was just like, I can do it in English?

1678
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,180
I was like, I don't fucking know.

1679
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,500
I was like, there's a Cantonese version?

1680
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,120
I was surprised.

1681
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,120
I was like, there's a Cantonese version of London Bridge is falling down?

1682
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,440
I was like, I can do that in English?

1683
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,160
I don't know.

1684
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:33,120
If you want me to teach you, the only like, like, Cantonese song that I sort of know is Monica.

1685
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,000
Because like, that was like my parents' favorite from my childhood.

1686
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,500
I'm like, Leslie?

1687
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:42,620
It's like, dance, dance, dance, dance, Monica.

1688
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,660
But also because it's half in English too.

1689
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,680
I only know the English parts.

1690
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,980
Like, I literally only know the English parts of that song.

1691
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:56,620
That's it.

1692
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:06,340
And they're like, what about like, they're like, oh, what about you sing like classic Cantonese anime openings?

1693
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,080
And I was like, I know them in English?

1694
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:21,190
They said like Hamtaro, the Cantonese opening of Hamtaro.

1695
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:27,620
I was like, oh, I grew up with that in English because it came out when I was in Canada.

1696
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,500
So I was just like, I don't know.

1697
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,560
It came out when I was in Canada.

1698
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,010
I was like, I was like, I'm sorry.

1699
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,350
I'm sorry.

1700
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:44,430
Any kid oriented stuff.

1701
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,690
Like, my child.

1702
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:49,790
I like, I went back to Hong Kong.

1703
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:59,950
To visit family and stuff like Hong Kong and like other parts in China visit family.

1704
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,390
But I missed out on like the childhood stuff.

1705
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,430
I missed out.

1706
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:18,870
And like, and like I experienced a lot of like Hong Kong stuff like later on when I was like a teenager.

1707
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,250
Not when I was a child.

1708
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,910
I had like, I would watch like, you know, TVB and stuff.

1709
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,150
And like Pearl.

1710
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:33,570
To like gain knowledge in Cantonese.

1711
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:36,990
So anyway.

1712
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:40,550
And anyway.

1713
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,170
No, I was born in Canada.

1714
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:47,010
I've been very... I was born in Canada.

1715
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,310
But I would come go back to...

1716
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,550
I did live in Hong Kong for a little bit.

1717
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:54,330
But like it was at a later stage of my life.

1718
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,370
So it was...

1719
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,790
Oh yeah, and Steven Chow movies and Zhao Xingqi.

1720
00:56:59,030 --> 00:56:59,730
Zhao Xingqi.

1721
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:00,030
Hey.

1722
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:03,870
So, so it was so funny because they're like, okay.

1723
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:04,670
All right.

1724
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,510
We need you to teach...

1725
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,410
We need you to teach nursery rhymes.

1726
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,110
And I was like, I did not grow up with it.

1727
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,690
I'm just like...

1728
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,510
I did not...

1729
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,950
I did not grow up with it.

1730
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,550
Like the anime shows I did.

1731
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,390
The Cantonese anime shows.

1732
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:24,270
I grew up with.

1733
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:27,430
Were like very, very, very old.

1734
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:31,670
Because they were like hand-me-downs from my parents' generations.

1735
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,410
So there's like...

1736
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,410
Suyinzi.

1737
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,470
Suyinzi and...

1738
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,330
Like...

1739
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,810
You know that part?

1740
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:45,270
I don't know.

1741
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:45,630
I don't...

1742
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,090
Because I was a child when I listened to it.

1743
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:48,810
I'm fucking...

1744
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:50,810
I'm fucking stupid.

1745
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,190
I just process the...

1746
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:57,870
I process the like...

1747
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:58,610
The sounds.

1748
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:00,290
But I didn't process the lyrics.

1749
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,610
And so...

1750
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,950
So it was like...

1751
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:03,250
That's...

1752
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,550
All I remember was like...

1753
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,890
And then...

1754
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,430
And also...

1755
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:19,970
Which was...

1756
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:20,870
What was it?

1757
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:21,270
Su-san?

1758
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,350
Is that...

1759
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,130
I don't know.

1760
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:23,750
I don't know.

1761
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:28,710
I just remember the melody.

1762
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:29,990
And then...

1763
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,450
What was it?

1764
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:32,510
Su-wan.

1765
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,390
Ton su-ka pum pum pum.

1766
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:38,630
That's literally the only lyrics I remembered from that song.

1767
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:39,670
From Dr. Shlump.

1768
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:40,570
Like...

1769
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,010
Literally...

1770
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,450
The only car...

1771
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,970
The only words I remember was like...

1772
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,530
Su-wan Tonsuka pum pum pum.

1773
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,160
And then...

1774
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,120
So...

1775
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,120
So they were like...

1776
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,360
Oh, you can teach us these songs!

1777
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:57,780
I was like...

1778
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:57,920
No.

1779
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,020
No, you don't understand.

1780
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,020
I don't...

1781
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,960
I can't...

1782
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,140
Put the melodies...

1783
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:10,220
So... I'm barely a student, let alone a teacher.

1784
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,600
No, you should not put that responsibility on me.

1785
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,440
So, that's why I was like...

1786
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,840
Yeah, like... I don't feel...

1787
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,520
I don't know.

1788
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,340
I don't feel comfortable.

1789
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:32,960
I was like, if we get somebody else to teach us, that would be...

1790
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,800
That would be more ideal.

1791
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,280
If we just get somebody else to teach us.

1792
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,620
But yes.

1793
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,820
Instead, we planned something else for the intermission part.

1794
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,540
Because I was like...

1795
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,420
It's not gonna go well.

1796
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,220
If I was a teacher, it's not...

1797
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,420
It's not gonna go well.

1798
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,080
I'm so sorry.

1799
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm so sorry.

1800
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,860
Barely a student.

1801
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,860
Barely a student.

1802
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,040
I'm barely...

1803
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,160
I'm barely an English student.

1804
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,180
Let alone...

1805
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,060
Let alone a Cantonese student.

1806
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,760
I'm barely...

1807
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,380
And when I speak Cantonese, I put English words in things I don't know how to say.

1808
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,400
That's...

1809
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,320
So... So that happened.

1810
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,440
I felt really bad.

1811
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,260
Because like I was asking for like...

1812
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,180
Last minute changes in the end.

1813
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,640
Because I was like... I didn't feel comfortable with being a teacher.

1814
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,040
But I still...

1815
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,100
I hope people enjoy...

1816
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,620
Yisun's concert.

1817
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,620
Like... I...

1818
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,240
I just...

1819
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,160
Mr Game Boy thank you for the super chat.

1820
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:35,480
Thank you.

1821
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:35,960
Thank you.

1822
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,500
They turn back to the original version.

1823
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,400
So Cantonese version.

1824
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,200
How nostalgic.

1825
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:40,040
Which one?

1826
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:40,780
Which one?

1827
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,340
There's so many.

1828
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,080
Also, I'm gonna get a tissue box real quick.

1829
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,020
I'll be right back guys.

1830
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,000
I'll be right back.

1831
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,460
I'm too lazy to get...

1832
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,420
I'm too lazy.

1833
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,220
Dad's at the groomers right now.

1834
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:51,840
He's getting...

1835
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,720
Oh my gosh, I shouldn't...

1836
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:54,180
Sorry.

1837
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,760
I stopped my son from making an edgy joke.

1838
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,260
Give me a sec.

1839
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:58,800
I'll be right back.

1840
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:23,660
Sorry.

1841
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,600
Sorry, I almost went Dr. Disrespect there, so...

1842
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:30,420
Sorry.

1843
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,120
Let me take a bite off of my sandwich real quick.

1844
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:37,640
Alright.

1845
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,340
As I was saying...

1846
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,680
As I was saying...

1847
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,260
Bro, what the fuck does that tweeting make?

1848
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,180
What the fuck?

1849
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,580
What the fuck?

1850
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:48,880
Okay.

1851
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:49,540
Alright.

1852
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,160
Like, his new tweet, I'm just like, what the fuck, man?

1853
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,580
Like...

1854
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,140
I'm...

1855
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,540
Jesus Christ.

1856
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,140
Anyway.

1857
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,140
Fucking internet is such a...

1858
01:01:59,140 --> 01:01:59,800
Twitter's...

1859
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:03,780
Moments where people need to fucking...

1860
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,020
get off the internet.

1861
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:06,920
Honestly.

1862
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,960
So yeah.

1863
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,900
Dad's at the groomers right now.

1864
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,240
He's trying to look pretty at the moment, so...

1865
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,720
That's why he's not there.

1866
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:20,660
Olympics!

1867
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,640
Updates on the...

1868
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,800
Updates on the Olympics.

1869
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,840
Did you guys know they fucking swim in the...

1870
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,920
The sand?

1871
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,300
The river?

1872
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,160
Like...

1873
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,500
What's wrong with...

1874
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,140
Like...

1875
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,460
Like, what the fuck is wrong with them?

1876
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,740
That river has not been cleaned in...

1877
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,120
In like...

1878
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,760
Hundreds of years.

1879
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:48,620
Like...

1880
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,860
For those who don't know...

1881
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,840
I saw...

1882
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:51,960
Okay.

1883
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,280
There was like article of it.

1884
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:54,780
I saw it.

1885
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,160
I was reading an article because it showed up on Twitter.

1886
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:58,620
Um...

1887
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,600
Let's see.

1888
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,880
Let me see if I can find it.

1889
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,980
I like sent the article...

1890
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,360
To my friend.

1891
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,820
Because I was like...

1892
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,020
Bro, that's fucking...

1893
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:08,900
Disgusting.

1894
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,540
I was like...

1895
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,000
That's so...

1896
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,820
Okay.

1897
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:13,640
Alright.

1898
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,280
I'll show you guys the picture.

1899
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,540
I'm gonna save this real quick.

1900
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:17,940
Um...

1901
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,000
I looked at this.

1902
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,420
I was like...

1903
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,540
What the fuck is wrong with people?

1904
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,920
Who agreed to this?

1905
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,420
Alright.

1906
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,520
Here's a picture.

1907
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,720
Of people...

1908
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,240
The water is brown.

1909
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,160
For those who don't know...

1910
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,260
What...

1911
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,000
Um...

1912
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,580
This river is...

1913
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,480
It is a very old river.

1914
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,620
That's been around for hundreds of years.

1915
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,940
So, it's like Italy's...

1916
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,440
Um...

1917
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,660
What is it?

1918
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,820
It's a moray.

1919
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,780
What the fuck?

1920
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,520
It's a moray.

1921
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,480
I'm trying to remember.

1922
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:04,740
Like Venice.

1923
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:05,200
Yes.

1924
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,760
Sorry.

1925
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:06,620
It's like Venice.

1926
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,260
Sorry.

1927
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,840
It's been a while since I've used my brain.

1928
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,000
I've been not using my brain.

1929
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:11,380
Like...

1930
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,140
You know how like...

1931
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,900
When I'm streaming, I don't use my brain?

1932
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,020
Now, imagine that.

1933
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,460
But like...

1934
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,860
At an even lower percentage.

1935
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:20,960
Like...

1936
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,340
At 1% of that.

1937
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:22,860
Just...

1938
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,520
Just imagine 1% of...

1939
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,460
That brain.

1940
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,860
That's me right now.

1941
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:27,480
So, I...

1942
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,100
I literally...

1943
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,040
I can't remember stuff.

1944
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:31,620
So...

1945
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,460
So, in Venice...

1946
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,280
The...

1947
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:35,880
The...

1948
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,320
The water in Venice...

1949
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,020
Where they travel everywhere...

1950
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:39,700
Um...

1951
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:40,920
That's the sewage.

1952
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,480
It's not clean either.

1953
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,920
It's fucking...

1954
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,440
Not clean there as well.

1955
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,960
Don't touch the water there in Venice.

1956
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:47,960
Um...

1957
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,580
Now, imagine that.

1958
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:49,620
But for Paris.

1959
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,920
And people are gonna swim there.

1960
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:51,980
For the Olympics.

1961
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,200
That's...

1962
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:54,500
That's...

1963
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,880
I'm not saying Venice is the sea...

1964
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,360
Is the river.

1965
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,640
I'm just saying comparing the river...

1966
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,120
The Seine river...

1967
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,940
Um...

1968
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,460
In Paris.

1969
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:04,940
Comparing the...

1970
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:05,960
The quality of that.

1971
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,080
Who like...

1972
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:07,940
The Venice water.

1973
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,380
Cause that's literally where people dump stuff.

1974
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:11,500
And like...

1975
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,120
Dump trash.

1976
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,160
And...

1977
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,060
And the sewage water.

1978
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:19,440
The Paris water has not been cleaned in hundreds of years.

1979
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,440
Like...

1980
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,320
Imagine back in the medieval days.

1981
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,240
Where...

1982
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:23,620
Fuck...

1983
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,420
There's like...

1984
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,060
Medieval poop in there.

1985
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,460
That's how fucking dirty it is.

1986
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,580
Like...

1987
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:30,280
And then...

1988
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,580
For the Paris Olympics...

1989
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:32,680
I saw this picture.

1990
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,020
I was like...

1991
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,460
There's no way they're swimming.

1992
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,020
It's...

1993
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,840
The Seine is a beautiful song.

1994
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,500
But everybody knows...

1995
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,300
This is not water anymore.

1996
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,680
Like...

1997
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,340
Um...

1998
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,280
And...

1999
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,660
Apparently...

2000
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,140
I was reading...

2001
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,640
Cause I was reading the tweets.

2002
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,220
And I was like...

2003
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,140
Under the article?

2004
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,780
Cause I get my news on Twitter nowadays.

2005
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:56,520
Like...

2006
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,180
Like everybody else in our generation these days.

2007
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,360
And the cor...

2008
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:00,780
Like...

2009
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,860
We're a problem right now.

2010
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,400
But I...

2011
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,440
Like...

2012
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,060
Like...

2013
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,160
We get our news on social media.

2014
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:06,820
On Twitter.

2015
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,620
Um...

2016
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:08,520
Like...

2017
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,800
I'm not gonna pay fucking five dollars for Washington Post.

2018
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:12,860
I'm sorry.

2019
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:19,980
I'm not gonna pay five fucking dollars to read more on Washington Post when I can get it for free on Twitter.

2020
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,100
Um...

2021
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,920
Hahaha...

2022
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,540
Hahaha...

2023
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:26,760
Anyway...

2024
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,100
I was looking at it.

2025
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,060
And apparently...

2026
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,280
People were protesting the Olympics.

2027
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:32,960
You know?

2028
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,160
Cause they're like...

2029
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:34,560
Oh...

2030
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,000
Cause like...

2031
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,940
A lot of places...

2032
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,920
A lot of places where the Olympics is hosted.

2033
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:43,160
They would spend millions of dollars for facilities and stuff.

2034
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,060
And...

2035
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,160
Like for facilities.

2036
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,780
And like to build place things for the Olympics.

2037
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,860
To build like...

2038
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:52,140
Um...

2039
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:52,840
Instead of like...

2040
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,200
And people were like...

2041
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,680
People got really mad about it.

2042
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,560
Also it's France.

2043
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,560
Also it's Paris.

2044
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,220
And like...

2045
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,640
It's apparently a thing where people like protest a lot in Paris.

2046
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,280
So...

2047
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:01,860
Hahaha...

2048
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:02,820
This was...

2049
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:03,580
This was...

2050
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,220
Another thing to protest on.

2051
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,160
So...

2052
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,880
Um...

2053
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:08,960
Obviously...

2054
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,100
France invested millions of dollars to clean the river.

2055
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,160
You know...

2056
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,880
Clean like hundreds of years of fucking shit water in the Seine.

2057
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,120
And...

2058
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:20,700
Uh...

2059
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,220
Hahaha...

2060
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,460
And...

2061
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,240
The protestors...

2062
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:25,980
To...

2063
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:28,500
To counteract...

2064
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,960
They started pooping in the water everyday.

2065
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,360
And I'm like...

2066
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,700
Are you fucking kidding me?

2067
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,340
People are actually currently...

2068
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:38,700
Um...

2069
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,120
Currently...

2070
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,940
Shitting in the wa...

2071
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:42,520
In the river.

2072
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,620
To protest against the Olympics.

2073
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,000
Um...

2074
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,160
And...

2075
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:50,760
And...

2076
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,200
It was...

2077
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,440
It was so fucked up.

2078
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:53,680
Because like...

2079
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,800
I was watching the video.

2080
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,700
And there was like this video of them like...

2081
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:59,440
Checking the pH level of the river.

2082
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,600
And...

2083
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,260
By the way...

2084
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,280
This photo is of Olympians...

2085
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,240
Looking at...

2086
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,100
Doing their fucking triathlon shit.

2087
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:07,940
In here.

2088
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:08,460
Haha...

2089
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,040
Yeah...

2090
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:09,420
Like...

2091
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,140
Pun intended.

2092
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,260
Um...

2093
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,500
Hahaha...

2094
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,660
And...

2095
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:14,760
And...

2096
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,780
By the way...

2097
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,680
The...

2098
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,080
The...

2099
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:17,820
I don't know...

2100
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,000
The...

2101
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,300
The ref or some shit.

2102
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:19,940
They like...

2103
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:20,320
Was like...

2104
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,420
They checked the pH level.

2105
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,420
And was like...

2106
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:22,960
Yay!

2107
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,500
It's an acceptable level!

2108
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,740
And I was like...

2109
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,500
I would not swim in an area...

2110
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,340
Where the fucking Olympic referee...

2111
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,940
Told everybody...

2112
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,180
That the water is now acceptable to swim.

2113
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,160
It's...

2114
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,780
Acceptable should not be the term...

2115
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,860
To describe like...

2116
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:43,840
Hahaha...

2117
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,260
Hahaha...

2118
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:45,800
Hahaha...

2119
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:45,860
Hahaha...

2120
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,540
Hahaha...

2121
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:50,820
That could not be the right word...

2122
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,380
To describe the condition...

2123
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,620
Of a swimmable water.

2124
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,120
Like...

2125
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:58,620
Hahaha...

2126
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,500
Like...

2127
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,560
What the fuck?

2128
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,800
Why did they say...

2129
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,140
Acceptable?

2130
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:05,920
Haha...

2131
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,520
Like...

2132
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,360
It's like...

2133
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,540
The water is good enough...

2134
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,100
Like...

2135
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,500
What the fuck?

2136
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,640
Um...

2137
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,480
Anyway...

2138
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,400
So...

2139
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,460
Other than...

2140
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:16,900
I know like...

2141
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:17,580
Everybody is like...

2142
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:17,760
Oh...

2143
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:17,800
I don't know...

2144
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,320
Doki...

2145
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,460
Have you seen like...

2146
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:19,900
The...

2147
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,120
The shooting...

2148
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:21,720
Uh...

2149
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,580
Competitions...

2150
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,060
And all that stuff...

2151
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:24,800
And like...

2152
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,740
All the cool poses...

2153
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,660
And everything...

2154
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:27,180
But like...

2155
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,200
Nobody is talking about the shit...

2156
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:29,540
What...

2157
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:29,720
Like...

2158
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,760
Everybody knows about that stuff...

2159
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,540
But like...

2160
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,840
I'm here to talk about this...

2161
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,080
Because this is a problem...

2162
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,320
Hahaha...

2163
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,040
This is...

2164
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,820
Hahaha...

2165
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:38,980
Hahaha...

2166
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,300
Like...

2167
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,940
This is...

2168
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,580
Um...

2169
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,480
This is a problem...

2170
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,580
Hahaha...

2171
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:47,780
Hahaha...

2172
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,820
This is...

2173
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,320
Just...

2174
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,120
I think...

2175
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,640
This is not a good thing...

2176
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,220
Something's not working...

2177
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,580
Like oh...

2178
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:06,740
Um...

2179
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,480
That was the reason...

2180
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:08,620
That he didn't feel...

2181
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:09,940
It was just parents잘 attends the Speca...

2182
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,120
The mess...

2183
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,140
What do you mean yes...?

2184
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,500
Was laying in over...

2185
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,400
That's...

2186
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,920
I think...

2187
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,140
I th...

2188
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:17,460
I think...

2189
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:17,780
That's why...

2190
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:28,680
It's been like that because it was a pollute- it was been polluted it was It's been polluted for so long That's why I'm like we can't just fix it in a year

2191
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:45,040
If a river has been polluted for hundreds of years I feel like it's not just gonna be fixed instead of a year

2192
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,280
Oh my god!

2193
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:55,660
This is medieval poop water!

2194
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:57,780
Anyway...

2195
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,280
I just don't think people should have swam in Lassen.

2196
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,660
I just...

2197
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,360
Dude...

2198
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,080
We have other sources of water!

2199
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,420
I just think we have other sources of water!

2200
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:16,740
We have other sources of water!

2201
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:21,200
We have other sources of water!

2202
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:23,640
Oh...

2203
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,860
But yeah, that was...

2204
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,020
I don't know, I just...

2205
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,740
I just thought that was the craziest shit I ever saw.

2206
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,820
I thought...

2207
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,840
I just thought that was like wild.

2208
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,640
I don't know.

2209
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,640
If it's been polluted for thousands...

2210
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,680
For like, apparently 2000 years.

2211
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,540
I don't know, it just feels...

2212
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,140
I don't know.

2213
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,860
I don't know.

2214
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,500
Nobody wants to touch Venice's water?

2215
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:55,780
Like...

2216
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:57,780
That is crazy too!

2217
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,740
It's like, this is why I don't swim in the ocean!

2218
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,340
This is why I don't do beaches.

2219
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,120
I don't touch ocean water.

2220
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:09,320
Like, I know.

2221
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,000
I know, like...

2222
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,500
It could be different.

2223
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,600
But like...

2224
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,440
It's just...

2225
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,200
Everybody poops in the ocean!

2226
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,860
And then there's microplastics in the ocean!

2227
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,920
There's literally a giant floating...

2228
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,540
I know, I'm fucking paranoid as hell.

2229
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,680
But like...

2230
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,960
I don't know, like...

2231
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,660
It's not like I'm a germaphobe.

2232
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,200
Or anything.

2233
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,820
It's literally nature's toilet.

2234
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,060
And...

2235
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:31,500
Um...

2236
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:32,860
And...

2237
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,060
And like...

2238
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,380
Like, there's...

2239
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,560
There's trash island!

2240
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,000
There's...

2241
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:41,500
There's...

2242
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:41,560
There's...

2243
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:42,700
There's...

2244
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:42,720
There's...

2245
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:44,260
There's...

2246
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:44,640
There's a fucking ocean!

2247
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,460
And...

2248
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,040
The ocean is the Earth's toilet!

2249
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,540
And it's just...

2250
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:52,300
I don't know.

2251
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,160
And then fucking Steve Irwin died in the ocean!

2252
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:55,840
Like, I don't want...

2253
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,840
What if there's a stingray?

2254
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,080
What?

2255
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,480
But like...

2256
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,260
You're like...

2257
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,520
But Doki...

2258
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,580
Doki...

2259
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,380
That was like a one in a million chance!

2260
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:08,200
Yes, but there is a one!

2261
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,040
There is...

2262
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,900
Somebody has to be that one!

2263
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,260
But...

2264
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:12,780
But...

2265
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,240
But...

2266
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:14,960
What if I...

2267
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,980
I've been unlucky?

2268
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,120
What if somehow I'm the one?

2269
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,180
I'm the one!

2270
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,920
It ain't zero!

2271
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,080
Exactly!

2272
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,460
Like...

2273
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,200
Real...

2274
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,040
And then there's like jellyfish too.

2275
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,720
I don't want to know what it's like to be stung by a jellyfish.

2276
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:33,920
Guys...

2277
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:34,760
Like, I...

2278
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:35,780
I really...

2279
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,240
I don't want to be...

2280
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:37,980
When...

2281
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,520
I don't want to be the one!

2282
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,180
To be stung by a jellyfish!

2283
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,920
I don't want to hit the lottery!

2284
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:44,220
I don't want to hit the lottery!

2285
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,540
There's like...

2286
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,760
Somebody has to hit the lottery!

2287
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,920
I don't want to be that somebody!

2288
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,360
It sucks, but...

2289
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,780
It sucks, yes, but I don't want to experience it!

2290
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,060
I don't want to experience it!

2291
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:00,820
Like...

2292
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:06,140
I'm happy to die never experiencing a jellyfish stung seeing me.

2293
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,720
Because apparently it's a high percent...

2294
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,040
Like what's the odds of getting stung by a...

2295
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:10,720
Odds...

2296
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,160
Of getting stung by a...

2297
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,360
Jellyfish...

2298
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,120
Alright...

2299
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,040
How common?

2300
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:26,360
As many as a hundred and fifty million jellyfish stings occurs around the world each year?!

2301
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,020
I could be in that one fifty million!

2302
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,080
One fifty million is way too high!

2303
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,180
Actually...

2304
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,560
That is actually very high.

2305
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,220
Like I...

2306
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,400
One hundred and fifty million!

2307
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:41,700
Like...

2308
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,220
By the way peeing on a jellyfish sting is considered stinging and not stinging.

2309
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:52,700
This is an urban myth that actually does... it's been... it was... it was spread by some sick fuck that wanted to get peed on.

2310
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,960
Because it does not help, by the way.

2311
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,000
Even I know that.

2312
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,180
Peeing on the wound does not help.

2313
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,340
Some fucking weird... weird guy was like...

2314
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,800
Was like, oh guys, what if you pee on it?

2315
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,260
Like, I heard it's helpful.

2316
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:15,260
And then apparently it spread... it spread everywhere.

2317
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:17,600
And now people think it's a real thing.

2318
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,980
But it's a... that's a myth.

2319
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,200
That's not real, by the way.

2320
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,900
Yeah, that is... that is not real.

2321
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,220
Don't ruin it for the weird...

2322
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:33,340
So if your friend got stu... if your friend...

2323
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,100
They might not even have been stung by a jellyfish.

2324
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,620
If your friend...

2325
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,200
Or your loved one...

2326
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,180
Or your...

2327
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,840
Or like, I don't know, co-worker or anything...

2328
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,360
Goes up to you... you're at the beach...

2329
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,720
And they go up to you...

2330
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,380
And was like, I got stung by a jellyfish.

2331
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,360
Please pee on it.

2332
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,340
They're a weird fucking asshole.

2333
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,700
They're a sick fuck.

2334
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,220
And then you'll know...

2335
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:07,320
And then you'll be like, thank you Doki for telling us this.

2336
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,160
My weird friend... my friend actually just ran up to me and was like...

2337
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,180
Asked me to pee on their jellyfish thing.

2338
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,160
Now I know.

2339
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,400
Now I'm gonna kink shame him.

2340
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,400
Or her, I don't know.

2341
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,740
Like... stings are not like exclusive to one gender.

2342
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:25,420
Like...

2343
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,480
It's not like they see... they see a man and it's like...

2344
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,180
Oh my god, I'm gonna sting that guy.

2345
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,580
So like, don't worry.

2346
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,780
They're very inclusive to everybody.

2347
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,860
Um, it doesn't matter to them if you get like stung.

2348
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:43,470
Um, it doesn't matter to them if you get like stung.

2349
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:45,350
Um...

2350
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:46,090
Um...

2351
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:48,910
Porziro, thank you for the super chat.

2352
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:49,810
Thank you, thank you.

2353
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:50,910
You should rub it with sand.

2354
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,850
I mean, sand is everywhere if you're at the beach.

2355
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:54,190
So, it'll be fine.

2356
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:55,550
Um...

2357
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:59,430
Real homies pee on this thing no matter what.

2358
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:00,950
Oh my god, what if the...

2359
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:02,770
The odds of it helping.

2360
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,450
Thank you for the super chat Deadpool.

2361
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:04,910
Thank you.

2362
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:05,370
Thank you.

2363
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:08,710
Also, drinking pee does not help by the way.

2364
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:09,670
It's actually very dangerous.

2365
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,270
Do not drink pee if you're like...

2366
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,470
stuck in a deserted island.

2367
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:13,850
You're stuck in the desert.

2368
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,210
And you can actually die.

2369
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,470
From drinking piss.

2370
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,390
That's a myth also.

2371
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:21,690
Do not do it.

2372
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:22,310
Like, I don't know.

2373
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:23,970
If you're ever stuck in a desert...

2374
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:24,770
And like...

2375
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:26,990
I actually looked this up.

2376
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:28,310
Cause I was like, is that real?

2377
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,590
It was invented by like fucking Bear Gryllis.

2378
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:32,830
Or whatever his name is.

2379
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:35,970
Um, Bear Gryllis literally perpetuated this myth.

2380
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,430
About drinking piss.

2381
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:38,390
To survive.

2382
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,250
In like, uh...

2383
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,890
He literally...

2384
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:45,950
He literally invented this fucking myth.

2385
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:47,010
Like...

2386
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:47,970
Just for TV.

2387
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:49,490
It's not...

2388
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:50,790
It's not real.

2389
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:51,930
It's...

2390
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:54,010
It's actually...

2391
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:57,350
Bear Gryllis... Yes, he lied to you.

2392
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:58,610
He went to a hotel.

2393
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:00,610
In the middle of filming.

2394
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:02,270
Like...

2395
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:07,150
Like... This man...

2396
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:09,710
If you researched Bear Gryllis...

2397
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:11,250
During like the film...

2398
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,090
Filming of his show.

2399
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:14,490
He literally went to a hotel.

2400
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:16,190
In the middle of it.

2401
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:21,650
He wasn't even surviving.

2402
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:23,190
He wasn't even surviving.

2403
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,590
He actually lived in a resort.

2404
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,730
In the middle of filming the show.

2405
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:28,290
Um...

2406
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:29,550
Anyway...

2407
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:32,470
Like he drank piss for no reason.

2408
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,870
Just so you guys know.

2409
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,150
There was no reason for him to do it.

2410
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,410
Um...

2411
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,630
Anyway...

2412
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:42,830
You're telling me I've been living...

2413
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:43,030
Yes!

2414
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:44,950
Reality V...

2415
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,570
Is not very real.

2416
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:48,230
Just so you guys know.

2417
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:49,610
It's not...

2418
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,650
It's not how to survive.

2419
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,850
Anyway... The reason why...

2420
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,950
You should not drink piss...

2421
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:59,270
Is that you can actually get dehydrated.

2422
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:01,690
Because it's salty.

2423
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:07,450
You will thank me later...

2424
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,850
If you're stranded in a desert.

2425
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,050
Okay guys... Instead...

2426
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:16,330
I will drink some water.

2427
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,010
So...

2428
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:20,410
And it has a lot of bacteria.

2429
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:23,230
So you would die faster.

2430
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:27,450
Um...

2431
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:28,230
Anyway...

2432
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,510
Don't listen to Bear Gryllis for survival tactics.

2433
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:32,110
Um...

2434
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:33,510
Just so you guys know.

2435
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:36,830
Do not listen to Bear Gryllis.

2436
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:39,450
I know like...

2437
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:41,710
Everyone are like...

2438
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,950
Who the fuck is Bear Gryllis?

2439
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:44,590
Oh thank god.

2440
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:45,390
Yes.

2441
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:49,590
And then the older generation would be like...

2442
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:50,790
Oh my god I'm so old.

2443
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:54,830
But...

2444
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:56,010
Instead...

2445
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:57,030
You listen to Ted Bear.

2446
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:59,350
That's the only bear I'll trust.

2447
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:00,890
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2448
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,120
Bear Gryllis.

2449
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,560
Bro he hasn't been relevant for years.

2450
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,900
Of course I'm gonna...

2451
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:11,800
Forget his name.

2452
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,300
He hasn't been relevant in so long.

2453
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,720
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2454
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,060
Who is Ted Bear?

2455
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:18,680
Okay.

2456
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,620
You just made like...

2457
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,380
Some dragoons feel very old.

2458
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,200
Ha ha ha.

2459
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,120
Jonathan Perry.

2460
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,340
Thank you Super Chat.

2461
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:26,700
Thank you.

2462
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,160
Thank you.

2463
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:30,820
So if I'm stranded in the desert, I'll survive better if I live in a hotel.

2464
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:31,360
Got it.

2465
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:31,800
Yes.

2466
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,240
Maybe you have zero surviv...

2467
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,120
Also why the fuck would you be alone in the desert?

2468
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,660
Who the fuck goes to the desert alone?

2469
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,840
That's like asking to like...

2470
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:41,900
Die alone.

2471
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,060
Like I don't know.

2472
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,320
Why would you?

2473
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,040
Why would you ever?

2474
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,340
I don't know.

2475
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:49,000
Go to the desert alone.

2476
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,120
Why?

2477
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,820
Speaking of like...

2478
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,620
You could be like...

2479
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:55,220
What's his name?

2480
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,960
The guy that's like the best rock climber in the world.

2481
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,140
What's his name?

2482
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,940
I like looked at...

2483
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,260
I was like...

2484
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,520
Um...

2485
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,460
Alex Honnold.

2486
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,440
I think that's his name.

2487
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:07,680
Yeah.

2488
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,180
So there's this guy.

2489
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,740
I was like reading about it today.

2490
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,580
Um... I live in a desert country.

2491
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:14,840
Yes but there's civil...

2492
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,000
But I meant like you know...

2493
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,220
Like the middle of the desert.

2494
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:18,080
You know what I mean?

2495
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,640
Not like where there's no civilization.

2496
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,900
Like why would you go to the middle of the desert alone?

2497
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:24,220
Or this guy.

2498
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,560
Unless you're that guy.

2499
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,020
Apparently that guy has no fear.

2500
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,800
He has brain... There's something wrong with his brain.

2501
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,200
Where he cannot feel fear.

2502
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:34,580
Or like the less... less fear.

2503
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,240
That's why he's like the best rock climber.

2504
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:38,500
Like the best like...

2505
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,000
Rock climber in the world.

2506
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:42,620
Because he literally cannot fear anything.

2507
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,780
And I was like reading like...

2508
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:45,740
A thread about him.

2509
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,160
Cause I was like who the fuck is that guy?

2510
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,340
Because they were talking about like...

2511
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,440
Um...

2512
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,100
They were talking about...

2513
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,120
Um...

2514
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,560
Uh...

2515
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,400
Like Olympians or whatever.

2516
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:00,580
Cause like...

2517
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:03,500
Cause Michael Phelps...

2518
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,320
The reason why Michael Phelps was able to win...

2519
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,840
A lot of...

2520
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:08,760
I don't know if he's dead yet.

2521
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:12,700
Literally his girlfriend begged him to stop doing rock climbing.

2522
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,160
And then...

2523
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,460
And then he straight up told her...

2524
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,940
By the way they have a child together.

2525
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,020
They straight up told her...

2526
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,040
That like...

2527
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,640
He was like I am under no obligation to spend my life span.

2528
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,180
Like what the fuck?

2529
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,960
Imagine telling your wife...

2530
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:28,160
Like...

2531
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,120
They have a child!

2532
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:38,720
Like...

2533
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,920
Like...

2534
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,560
Oh my god!

2535
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:45,700
Anyway...

2536
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:46,940
Um...

2537
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,380
Anyway as I was saying...

2538
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:51,860
It came from like...

2539
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:52,660
Cause I was like looking at...

2540
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,240
I was reading up this thing about Michael Phelps.

2541
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:55,880
By the way Michael Phelps...

2542
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,420
Literally entire body is designed to swim.

2543
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,040
Cause he's like a fucking...

2544
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,900
I don't know like fucking genetics.

2545
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:02,680
It's wild.

2546
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,760
And the only reason he got into swimming is because he has like ADHD.

2547
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,960
And like his mom...

2548
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:10,660
Threw him in the pool.

2549
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,480
To waste his energy.

2550
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,760
Which I...

2551
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,860
It's not like he wanted...

2552
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:19,020
He grew up and was like I love swimming.

2553
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,500
He was like...

2554
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,360
Cause mom was like you have too much energy.

2555
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,180
I'm gonna put you swimming classes to waste your energy.

2556
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,120
Like...

2557
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,480
Like what the fuck?

2558
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,280
Um...

2559
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,520
Um...

2560
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:36,860
Um...

2561
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:38,960
His body is literally built for swimming.

2562
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:40,940
Um...

2563
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,520
He's like double jointed or whatever.

2564
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,760
Like he has like double jointed ankles.

2565
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,820
So when he kicks...

2566
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,900
When he kicks the water...

2567
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,180
Um...

2568
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:52,920
It basically...

2569
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,240
When he kicks the water he like...

2570
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,720
Goes further because he's double jointed.

2571
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:58,980
And then...

2572
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,540
And then apparently...

2573
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,980
I mean look at this shape.

2574
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,180
Look at the shape of his...

2575
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,060
He has very long arms.

2576
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,900
Like look at the shape of his body.

2577
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:10,600
You can tell it.

2578
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,360
That is not like anatomy wise.

2579
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,300
That is not right anatomy.

2580
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:20,380
And...

2581
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,560
And the reason why he's like...

2582
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,960
Known as the best swimmer in the world is because...

2583
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,560
Not only does his like...

2584
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,420
Fucking body build different.

2585
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,680
His like...

2586
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,520
The chemicals.

2587
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,640
Like the chemicals in his body...

2588
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:44,500
Like, whatever acid or whatever... there's like an acid that is produced that causes tiredness or whatever.

2589
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:49,460
That makes you... you know, the more you work and the more of this... what was it?

2590
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,100
Lactic acid that's produced.

2591
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,780
And the more it produces, the more tired you get.

2592
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:59,400
This man's fucking body produces half of a normal Olympian.

2593
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,860
Like... what the fuck?

2594
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:04,620
Like... it's just like a typical athlete.

2595
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:11,360
You know that they have less lactic acid than like a normal person like us.

2596
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,520
Like, I don't know.

2597
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,900
I'm pretty sure there's no like Olympians here in my chat.

2598
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,740
Because you're here watching the stream instead of training for the Olympics.

2599
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,480
It's not over yet.

2600
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,280
Or partying at the Olympic Village.

2601
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,120
So like, he has half of a regular Olympic athlete.

2602
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:28,760
So...

2603
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,540
So like...

2604
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:31,840
A regular Olympic athlete...

2605
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:35,300
Already has less lactic acid than a normal person.

2606
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,420
Now Michael Phelps has half of that.

2607
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,720
That's so fucking crazy.

2608
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,880
He's literally built to swim.

2609
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:41,480
Like...

2610
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,740
He's literally built to swim.

2611
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,040
That's insane.

2612
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:53,640
That's just... biologically he's just built different.

2613
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,400
Nervous man.

2614
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:00,140
Yeah.

2615
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,980
Nothing but insurance.

2616
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,860
Oh shit.

2617
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:05,900
Braum Pro is here.

2618
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:06,980
Hey Braum Pro!

2619
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,680
Hey man.

2620
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,380
Um...

2621
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:12,400
But yeah, he's...

2622
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,620
Yeah, it's actually...

2623
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,920
It's actually crazy to think about.

2624
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,180
So yeah, anyway.

2625
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:21,140
The reason why I got to Michael Phelps is because I talked about this rock climbing dude.

2626
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,460
But that's... like...

2627
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,160
I love like...

2628
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,820
I don't know if this is true.

2629
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,820
But like this was in the article.

2630
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:32,300
About that guy that has no fear processors.

2631
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,800
And like...

2632
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,760
I was like...

2633
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,900
I love this quote.

2634
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,180
It's such a good quote.

2635
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,860
Like from a scientist.

2636
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,320
Like...

2637
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:44,480
That kid's amygdala is in fire.

2638
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,380
It's like...

2639
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,960
It's like a doctor's way of saying like...

2640
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,940
That kid ain't right.

2641
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,200
Like...

2642
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,440
Yo, that kid ain't right man.

2643
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:01,440
Like...

2644
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,540
Because like...

2645
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,200
Something ain't right about this child.

2646
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:10,800
But yeah, that's why he's able to climb.

2647
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,400
Like if you guys have ever looked at this...

2648
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:13,580
What's his name?

2649
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:14,620
Um...

2650
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,920
I'm not talking about Michael Phelps.

2651
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,220
I'm talking about the other guy.

2652
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,320
The rock climbing guy.

2653
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:22,820
I literally told his girlfriend like, why do I need to extend my lifespan for you?

2654
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,380
Like, Jesus Christ.

2655
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,980
His fucking girlfriend who has a kid with him.

2656
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,380
Um, he was like, Alex Honnold.

2657
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,840
Yeah, Alex Honnold or whatever.

2658
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,020
Um, yeah.

2659
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,080
Um, that's why he's able to...

2660
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,360
Like, for those who don't know how crazy the stuff he does.

2661
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:44,860
Let me pull up like some... because I looked him up.

2662
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,300
I was like, who the fuck is that guy?

2663
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,780
Like, he's apparently really famous.

2664
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,460
I was like, who the fuck is he?

2665
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,240
And then I looked up photos.

2666
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,400
And I looked up the photos.

2667
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:55,880
Yeah?

2668
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,680
And then I see the climbs he does.

2669
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,720
I was like, oh that scientist was definitely right.

2670
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:06,120
Like... I was like, oh yeah, no.

2671
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,880
He's... he does not fear anything.

2672
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,580
And don't worry, I'll show you guys what I mean.

2673
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:12,260
Yeah.

2674
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:13,960
Um...

2675
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:17,860
Yeah.

2676
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:22,880
I saw this and I was like, holy fuck!

2677
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,940
That... that kid ain't right.

2678
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,440
That kid ain't right.

2679
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,900
Like...

2680
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,420
What's... amygdala?

2681
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:41,140
That's where... that's the part of your brain that produces fear.

2682
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,340
That's what it is.

2683
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,780
This man doesn't produce fear.

2684
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:47,700
Um...

2685
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:51,420
This getting over... what if getting over it was real?

2686
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:52,820
Um...

2687
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,400
He's a difficult... he's a guy from the difficult game about climbing!

2688
01:28:59,040 --> 01:28:59,780
That's him!

2689
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,600
He's the climber bro!

2690
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,800
It's that game!

2691
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,700
Something wrong with that... something wrong with that boy.

2692
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,140
Um... but yeah.

2693
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,800
And you're like, how old is this man?

2694
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,960
That's a good question.

2695
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,140
He's like 38?

2696
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:20,120
He's 38 and holy fuck!

2697
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,860
Like you took this from like... somebody younger!

2698
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:25,820
You know!

2699
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:27,440
This man's 38!

2700
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,520
Oh my god.

2701
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:32,820
Um...

2702
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:33,760
But yeah.

2703
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,400
That's him.

2704
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,340
Not for long.

2705
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:38,980
Not for long.

2706
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,700
Not for long.

2707
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:42,520
But anyway.

2708
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,140
That's my... that's another life update here.

2709
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:45,940
But anyway.

2710
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:45,940
That's my...

2711
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:45,940
that's another life update here.

2712
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:46,700
Like shit I'm reading.

2713
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,800
Stuff I... stuff that shows up on my...

2714
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:51,840
Um...

2715
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,600
On my Twitter feed.

2716
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:55,680
Um...

2717
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,160
Um...

2718
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:00,800
But yeah.

2719
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,580
It's been...

2720
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,820
It's been like...

2721
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:04,040
Um...

2722
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,320
It's been a wild...

2723
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,740
It's been a wild...

2724
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:09,020
Oh speaking of wild week.

2725
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:09,880
But speaking of Olympics.

2726
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:10,860
I'm so sad.

2727
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,040
They're not making...

2728
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:12,720
Did you guys hear?

2729
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:14,060
I don't know if this is true or not.

2730
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:15,440
Um...

2731
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,340
I don't know if this is true or not.

2732
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,440
But like apparently...

2733
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,420
The reason why...

2734
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:24,720
We don't have...

2735
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,620
Um...

2736
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,180
We don't have another Sonic and Mario...

2737
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,780
Olympics game.

2738
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:32,740
Is because the Olympics decided to go for NFTs.

2739
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:34,260
Like...

2740
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,720
Four years too late.

2741
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,220
Like...

2742
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,880
Like what the f...

2743
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:41,820
Like...

2744
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:43,180
Bro...

2745
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:45,860
They could have done that four years ago.

2746
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:46,540
Like...

2747
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,440
I don't understand.

2748
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,040
Who's still investing in NFTs?

2749
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,940
Who's still...

2750
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,540
I can right click save...

2751
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,220
A PNG.

2752
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,520
Um...

2753
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:01,460
But yeah.

2754
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:03,720
They decided to be like...

2755
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,820
We're gonna go for it with...

2756
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:09,460
Having NFTs instead of Sonic and Mario Olympics.

2757
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,560
Which...

2758
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:11,920
I don't know.

2759
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:13,820
Really weird.

2760
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:16,180
They could have done that four years ago.

2761
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:18,580
It would have been more relevant four years ago.

2762
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:21,980
They would have actually made money four years ago.

2763
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:26,320
Because back then, nobody knows jack shit about NFTs.

2764
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:31,940
Like, nobody knew that NFTs are mostly pump and dump.

2765
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,540
But like, I guess...

2766
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:41,040
I guess the Olympic Committee didn't find out about that.

2767
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,080
So that's why we're not...

2768
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:47,220
That's why we're not getting another Sonic and...

2769
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,180
Sonic and Mario Olympic Games.

2770
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,540
No, not your regular people.

2771
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:57,360
I don't know if you guys know this.

2772
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,300
But NFTs got so popular that regular people were investing into it.

2773
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:03,420
Because they didn't know it better.

2774
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,620
That's how you got all those scams.

2775
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,380
From like, you know...

2776
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:08,520
Like Logan Paul.

2777
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:10,500
No, Doki.

2778
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,020
You're Logan Paul.

2779
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:11,320
Logan Paul.

2780
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:12,140
Who the fuck...

2781
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:13,980
I don't want to fucking collab with Logan Paul.

2782
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,900
No, your Prime...

2783
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:21,260
Prime tastes like shit.

2784
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:26,280
Because it's an energy drink.

2785
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,340
Prime sponsors.

2786
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:37,240
Crazy.

2787
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,580
I don't know why they sued for having an opinion.

2788
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,580
I live in NA.

2789
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,380
But they're gonna fucking...

2790
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,420
Everybody said it!

2791
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,340
It's not just...

2792
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:54,140
If they're gonna sue me because I said Prime is shit.

2793
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:56,000
And that like...

2794
01:32:56,860 --> 01:33:00,700
And that Logan Paul still has that fucking NFT scam.

2795
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,340
That he still hasn't...

2796
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,260
You know what doesn't taste like shit?

2797
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:08,500
Uh...

2798
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:09,560
Gamer subs.

2799
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:12,540
By the way, if you use my code Doki...

2800
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,120
Freaking...

2801
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,400
Doki, be careful.

2802
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,700
You can't say Logan Paul is a scammer.

2803
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:27,640
He's suing a YouTuber for doing just that.

2804
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,060
Thank you for the super chat, Chie.

2805
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:29,480
Thank you.

2806
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,040
Thank you.

2807
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:33,000
Bro, if he sues me...

2808
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,240
The amount of publicity I will get from that...

2809
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:36,720
Like...

2810
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,320
Because I said in one fucking...

2811
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,400
I didn't make it 20...

2812
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,600
I didn't make a fucking one hour docu-series about it.

2813
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:44,320
Like...

2814
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:54,040
Like, he's suing the guy that made the one hour plus docu-series.

2815
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:03,240
It's not even bad publicity for me.

2816
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:05,200
It's bad publicity for him.

2817
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:07,900
Because he's suing a fucking random VTuber.

2818
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:10,080
Like, what the fuck is wrong?

2819
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:10,960
He's fucking...

2820
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,720
He has millions of dollars.

2821
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,840
Like, I...

2822
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,400
If I had that...

2823
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,200
As much money as Logan Paul...

2824
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,040
I would fucking...

2825
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,360
Do better stuff with my time.

2826
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:23,960
Like...

2827
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,460
Did you guys see what's going on for MrBeast right now?

2828
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:30,840
Bro, everybody's getting...

2829
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,080
Everybody's getting cancelled.

2830
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,340
Like, bro...

2831
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:35,280
Every...

2832
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,600
Everybody's getting cancelled.

2833
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:37,880
Bro...

2834
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:38,440
I'm getting cancelled right now.

2835
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:39,840
It's actually insane.

2836
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,420
Like...

2837
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:43,420
Apparently...

2838
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:46,720
For those who live under the rock...

2839
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,820
Um...

2840
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:48,500
There...

2841
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,860
There was like a huge thing that got released or something.

2842
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,420
Like, you tell all...

2843
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:54,800
On MrBeast.

2844
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:56,700
By the way, Feast...

2845
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:59,160
Everybody knows Feastables taste like shit.

2846
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:00,160
Like, I don't...

2847
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:00,360
I...

2848
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:02,320
I don't understand.

2849
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:03,600
Like...

2850
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:04,580
Every...

2851
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:06,880
Everybody knows...

2852
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,260
Feastables does not taste good.

2853
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,160
Like, it's not a good chocolate brand.

2854
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,260
Like...

2855
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,900
I tried it once and it's fucking dog shit.

2856
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:16,800
Like...

2857
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:21,560
Um...

2858
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:23,000
But...

2859
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,640
Everybody's getting cancelled right now on the internet.

2860
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:27,760
I...

2861
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,380
To be fair, MrBeast has always had like a lot of people trying to cancel him.

2862
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,400
But like...

2863
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:33,920
Apparently...

2864
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,740
The newest vid...

2865
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:35,860
I watched like half of it.

2866
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:36,600
Cause it's like...

2867
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,480
The video's like almost an...

2868
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,600
Wait, how long is the video?

2869
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:40,840
I actually literally have it in my history.

2870
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:41,660
I watched it last night.

2871
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:42,660
Cause I was...

2872
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:43,620
I thought it was a joke.

2873
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:44,860
But then like...

2874
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:45,420
Cause like...

2875
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:47,200
The comic section was really funny.

2876
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:48,100
Like...

2877
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:49,980
Like...

2878
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:50,880
That's why...

2879
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,700
Cause you know, before you watch the video, you read the comments, right?

2880
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,480
Like for the...

2881
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:55,140
Like the...

2882
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:56,180
I do that.

2883
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,580
I read the comments just to...

2884
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:58,080
Yeah, like...

2885
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:58,480
See...

2886
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:01,380
Get like an appetizer about what's going on.

2887
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:01,860
You know?

2888
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,520
Like...

2889
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:03,460
I don't know.

2890
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:03,980
I don't know.

2891
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,180
I don't know.

2892
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:04,820
I don't know.

2893
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:05,780
I don't know.

2894
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:05,800
But...

2895
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,980
It's like an appy.

2896
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:07,720
Like I'll be like...

2897
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,060
Oh, okay.

2898
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:08,920
Let's see like...

2899
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:09,320
What's...

2900
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:10,400
What could be going on.

2901
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,320
And then...

2902
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:15,420
The comic section for that video was so fucking wild that I thought it was a joke.

2903
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:16,280
Cause I was like...

2904
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,980
MrBeast is always trying to get cancelled.

2905
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:18,800
So like...

2906
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,340
What's the difference this time?

2907
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,140
And then like...

2908
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:21,820
I read the comments.

2909
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,160
I was like...

2910
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,340
Oh, this has to be a joke.

2911
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:24,020
Right?

2912
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:26,300
And I watched a video and I was like...

2913
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,240
Oh, this is not...

2914
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:27,780
This is real.

2915
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,560
Yeah, this is an hour long...

2916
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:30,680
I didn't watch an hour of it.

2917
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:31,640
Because like...

2918
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:33,220
Um...

2919
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,020
He put a lot of memes into it.

2920
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:35,760
So...

2921
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,000
I was just like...

2922
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,720
That's why I didn't take it seriously.

2923
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:39,720
I...

2924
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:42,220
I...

2925
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:42,980
I...

2926
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:43,060
I...

2927
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:43,460
I...

2928
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:43,540
I...

2929
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,540
I did take it seriously because there was like...

2930
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,820
It was filled with like memes and stuff.

2931
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:48,720
And...

2932
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,560
The guy got sent a cease and desist letter.

2933
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,000
And then he made a meme video too.

2934
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:56,540
But then I like watched half of it.

2935
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:57,040
Like...

2936
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,220
I think like I watched the la...

2937
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:02,020
Like I watched the beginning a little bit and then I skipped to the end.

2938
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:02,960
Um...

2939
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:03,880
And then...

2940
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,760
Um...

2941
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:05,660
And then...

2942
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:05,740
So...

2943
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,180
I was like...

2944
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:06,660
Wait...

2945
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:08,020
That shit's pretty bad.

2946
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:08,840
Like...

2947
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,040
Yeah, he got a cease and...

2948
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:11,940
Like literally...

2949
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,220
If you look at the comments...

2950
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:13,680
I didn't...

2951
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,080
I didn't think it was real.

2952
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,820
I didn't think this video was real because I was looking at the comment section.

2953
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:20,860
And...

2954
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:23,320
And somebody was like...

2955
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:23,980
You know what?

2956
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:27,240
I'm sorry to think MrBeast might not even be his real name.

2957
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,820
And I was like...

2958
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,660
Of course if I see that...

2959
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,340
I thought it was a joke.

2960
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:35,500
Yeah...

2961
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:35,740
I was like...

2962
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,280
I...

2963
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,260
I thought the video was a joke because I saw...

2964
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:47,080
That's literally the top comment.

2965
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:48,160
So like...

2966
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,020
Of course I didn't take it seriously.

2967
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,240
Like...

2968
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:55,480
And then I watched the video and I was like...

2969
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,000
Oh shit.

2970
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:58,780
There's some serious allegations in there.

2971
01:37:59,140 --> 01:37:59,820
Um...

2972
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,740
But this is what I mean.

2973
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:05,200
This is literally like the top comment on that video.

2974
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:05,720
Like...

2975
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,260
Like...

2976
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:18,740
So, yeah...

2977
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,400
That's why...

2978
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,980
That's why I didn't think it was like, oh, this has to be a joke vid.

2979
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:24,460
It has...

2980
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:27,420
By the way, this video has 9 million views.

2981
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:31,620
So I was like, whoa, that's a lot for a one hour video.

2982
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,980
But yeah, everybody's getting cancelled.

2983
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:41,760
Yay.

2984
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:44,860
I feel like that's...

2985
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:47,920
That's basically a lifespan of a creator.

2986
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:51,760
If you create long enough, you'll eventually get cancelled.

2987
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:59,400
No, it absolutely is a sarcasm.

2988
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:01,140
That's why I thought that was a joke video.

2989
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,620
This year's been fucking wild.

2990
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:04,480
It has been.

2991
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,680
Oh my god, I had the scariest experience, by the way.

2992
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:09,660
Here's another life update.

2993
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,980
I had like one of the scariest experiences living like in my apartment alone.

2994
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:20,520
And like, it was fucking crazy because...

2995
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:24,620
Because like, I got woken...

2996
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:25,660
My door was open.

2997
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,060
My bedroom door was open.

2998
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,240
And...

2999
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,560
My bedroom door was open.

3000
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,600
And usually I have it closed.

3001
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,160
If I'm like...

3002
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:35,640
I'm not alone.

3003
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,660
But like...

3004
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:38,700
But then I had it open because I was like, okay, I'm alone.

3005
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:39,940
And...

3006
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,840
No, this isn't my current...

3007
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,900
Like, my current place.

3008
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:43,680
Not my new place.

3009
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:44,940
And then...

3010
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:45,800
And then...

3011
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:46,740
Dad...

3012
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:48,420
Woke up...

3013
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,720
And started barking...

3014
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:51,980
At the door.

3015
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:53,980
Like, outside...

3016
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:54,620
Like, at the door.

3017
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,560
Like, on my bed.

3018
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,500
And I was freaking out.

3019
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,440
Because I was like...

3020
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,060
It was like...

3021
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:01,060
Three in the morning?

3022
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,560
It was three in the morning.

3023
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:03,880
I don't even remember what day this was.

3024
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:05,440
But it was three in the morning.

3025
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,580
And then...

3026
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,680
I was like...

3027
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,560
What the fuck?

3028
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:09,260
Like, I was...

3029
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:10,040
Because like...

3030
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,860
He's never done that before.

3031
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,140
And so then...

3032
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:15,520
I closed the door.

3033
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:16,660
Because I was like...

3034
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:17,340
Oh no.

3035
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:17,940
Like...

3036
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,820
I closed the door.

3037
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,720
Because I was like...

3038
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,560
What's going on?

3039
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,260
And then...

3040
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:25,600
So...

3041
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,560
And then I just like...

3042
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,300
Looked at the door.

3043
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:28,240
And then I looked at dad.

3044
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,600
And then dad...

3045
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,860
Was like...

3046
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:31,920
Like...

3047
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,500
And then he was like...

3048
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:34,280
Like, he kept growling.

3049
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:35,420
He kept growling.

3050
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,060
And I was like...

3051
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,080
And I was like listening.

3052
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:38,740
And I didn't hear anything.

3053
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,180
And then...

3054
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:41,400
So then I was like...

3055
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,120
Then I...

3056
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,320
Because I was really...

3057
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,200
I was really freaked out.

3058
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:44,480
You know?

3059
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:45,080
I was like...

3060
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,460
So fucking freaked out.

3061
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:47,960
And then so like...

3062
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,080
I opened the door dad.

3063
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:50,080
And I pushed...

3064
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:59,240
Why get a dog if he's not going to help protect you?

3065
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:01,260
So like...

3066
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:03,380
I opened the door.

3067
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:04,560
And I...

3068
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,340
I slapped his butt to push him out.

3069
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:07,920
And I...

3070
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:08,180
And then...

3071
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:10,440
And then he like walked out.

3072
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,060
And so I was like...

3073
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:12,680
I don't know!

3074
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:13,580
I was scared!

3075
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:17,480
I was scared!

3076
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:21,710
And...

3077
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:24,190
And so...

3078
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:30,310
So I...

3079
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:33,250
I did like a playful slap.

3080
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:33,790
Like...

3081
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:34,470
You know?

3082
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:34,910
Like...

3083
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:35,430
Eee...

3084
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:36,450
And then push...

3085
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:39,270
And then push him out of the door.

3086
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:40,330
He walked away!

3087
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:40,670
He's locked out!

3088
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:43,550
It's not like he restrained himself.

3089
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:48,150
Look, somebody superchatted me too while I'm telling this story so I'm not a bad person.

3090
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:50,410
And it was their first superchat.

3091
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:56,770
Like, J.D.

3092
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:59,650
Ward, thank you for your very first superchat.

3093
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:00,730
Thank you, thank you.

3094
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:02,950
So, it's not like he like...

3095
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,610
It's not like he like, fought back.

3096
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:08,170
He willingly left the door.

3097
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:10,870
I just gave him a little motivated push.

3098
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:12,270
So...

3099
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:13,850
Um...

3100
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:16,260
So...

3101
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:18,070
So...

3102
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:19,410
He walked out.

3103
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:21,650
And then...

3104
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:24,870
And then he like, barked a little bit.

3105
01:42:25,150 --> 01:42:27,130
And then he walked back inside.

3106
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:28,410
Like, he came back.

3107
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:31,310
And then looked at the door and started going...

3108
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:33,590
So obviously...

3109
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:35,730
That freaked me out.

3110
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,970
Like...

3111
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:37,650
Like...

3112
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:39,110
He went outside.

3113
01:42:39,530 --> 01:42:40,550
He went outside.

3114
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,850
Walked a little bit further.

3115
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:44,190
But then he came back.

3116
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:45,350
So...

3117
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:48,110
Obviously...

3118
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:49,870
I was freaking out.

3119
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:54,770
And then...

3120
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:55,850
Yeah...

3121
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:57,590
Like, it's 3 in the morning!

3122
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:58,810
Like, what the fuck?

3123
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:01,410
I've never had this experience before.

3124
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:03,910
I've never...

3125
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:05,490
It's probably a cat.

3126
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:07,550
I live in a very high...

3127
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:08,030
I live in a very high floor.

3128
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:09,890
I don't think a cat...

3129
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:12,050
Is gonna be like...

3130
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:14,230
And like...

3131
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,130
There's like the entrance...

3132
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:17,630
Like my entrance door...

3133
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:20,730
Is like further away from the living room.

3134
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:24,810
So like you have to like walk like a bit to get to the entrance way.

3135
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:25,590
Cause it's like a hallway.

3136
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:28,590
It's like a hallway from that to the living room.

3137
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:29,530
And then...

3138
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,890
And then like...

3139
01:43:30,890 --> 01:43:32,050
And so then I was freaking out.

3140
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:32,930
So I looked outside.

3141
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:34,010
I see nothing.

3142
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:34,830
Obviously.

3143
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:35,790
I see nothing.

3144
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:38,790
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking I was gonna see.

3145
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,290
Like I don't know!

3146
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:43,090
Cause like I've never had that happen before!

3147
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,330
So I closed the door!

3148
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:46,350
Cause I was like...

3149
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:48,690
Okay but what if there was something and I didn't see it?

3150
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:49,530
You know?

3151
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,070
And then...

3152
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:52,990
I was on my phone.

3153
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:55,650
I wasn't playing any videos on my phone cause I was like I shouldn't make any noise.

3154
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:58,830
I shouldn't make any sound or noise.

3155
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:01,430
I shouldn't make any sound or noise.

3156
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:04,570
Because I was freaking out at 3 in the fucking morning.

3157
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:06,790
I was like freaking out!

3158
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:08,190
I was like freaking out!

3159
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:09,030
I was like freaking out!

3160
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:13,130
I was texting some friends about what's going on.

3161
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:13,270
I was texting some friends about what's going on.

3162
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:14,610
Cause what the fuck is happening?

3163
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:17,950
Never before dad's done this before.

3164
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:19,810
This has never happened before.

3165
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:21,070
Um...

3166
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:22,490
Ever since like...

3167
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:23,410
Like ever.

3168
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:25,230
Like in my life with dad.

3169
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:27,250
This has never happened before.

3170
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:28,610
Um...

3171
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:29,690
So...

3172
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:31,190
So I just sat there.

3173
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:32,730
Like on my bed.

3174
01:44:33,070 --> 01:44:35,050
And then dad was looking at the door.

3175
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:37,610
Occasionally growling at the door by the way.

3176
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:39,470
And then...

3177
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:41,690
And then like...

3178
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:44,330
And then we both heard something outside the door.

3179
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:47,150
Like I don't know how to explain it.

3180
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:48,470
We both heard something.

3181
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:50,150
I don't even know what it is.

3182
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:51,590
I heard something.

3183
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:53,810
It was like...

3184
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:56,070
I think I just got my first paranormal experience.

3185
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:57,350
It was fucking crazy.

3186
01:44:58,610 --> 01:44:58,810
Like...

3187
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:00,650
Like that.

3188
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,790
This is the sound I heard.

3189
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:05,070
This is like my sandwich paper.

3190
01:45:05,310 --> 01:45:06,650
But it was like this.

3191
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:07,250
Sort of.

3192
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:08,230
But like...

3193
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:10,130
Like that.

3194
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:13,270
Outside my door.

3195
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:15,590
But it's not like directly outside my door.

3196
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:20,130
There's no way a raccoon would be like...

3197
01:45:20,130 --> 01:45:21,390
I live in an apartment.

3198
01:45:21,610 --> 01:45:26,910
There's no way a raccoon has climbed up to this floor.

3199
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:28,590
There's no way a raccoon has climbed up to this floor.

3200
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:30,050
There's no way a raccoon has climbed up to this floor.

3201
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:33,690
And so it's high up enough that a raccoon will not be there.

3202
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:35,170
And so it's high up enough that a raccoon will not be there.

3203
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:42,610
Did you see it?

3204
01:45:43,190 --> 01:45:43,670
Did you see it?

3205
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:46,370
I don't fucking know.

3206
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:48,010
And then obviously...

3207
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:50,190
Dad freaked out and started barking.

3208
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:51,090
Really aggressively.

3209
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:55,810
He started barking aggressively again.

3210
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:57,530
And I was just like...

3211
01:45:58,590 --> 01:45:59,330
I heard that.

3212
01:45:59,650 --> 01:46:01,170
And I opened the door.

3213
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:02,230
I was like, I don't know.

3214
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:04,570
I was like, if I'm gonna die up here...

3215
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:06,710
I wanna see what it is.

3216
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:10,130
I don't fucking know.

3217
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:13,190
Like, there's only one door.

3218
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:17,030
I can't... I'm not at ground level.

3219
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:18,770
So I'm trapped, you know?

3220
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:22,390
I was... I was trapped.

3221
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:23,470
And...

3222
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:30,110
The door is like...

3223
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:32,710
There's only one entrance slash exit.

3224
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:34,230
So...

3225
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:39,870
I opened the door again after a while.

3226
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:41,730
And then...

3227
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:43,050
Because I have to pee too.

3228
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:43,990
Okay, to be fair.

3229
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:46,990
The reason why I suddenly got so brave was like...

3230
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:47,810
I had to pee.

3231
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:48,590
Like...

3232
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:52,650
So I was like...

3233
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,570
I am...

3234
01:46:53,570 --> 01:46:56,390
If I am going to get haunted...

3235
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:57,910
At least let me pee.

3236
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:10,800
Yeah, anyway...

3237
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,660
Anyway...

3238
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:16,020
Like, I had to use the bathroom.

3239
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,660
So like...

3240
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,000
So like, I opened the door.

3241
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:20,320
Nobody.

3242
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:21,480
And I just turned on...

3243
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:22,400
I went to the living room.

3244
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:23,100
Turned on the lights.

3245
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:23,920
And then went to the bathroom.

3246
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:24,920
And I was like...

3247
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:25,120
Okay.

3248
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,360
I don't know if...

3249
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:29,360
And then dad got calmed down.

3250
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:31,220
Dad wasn't barking or growling anymore.

3251
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:31,900
Because like...

3252
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:32,780
He also...

3253
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:33,140
Because like...

3254
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:35,880
I also forced him to be outside too.

3255
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:36,840
Because I was like...

3256
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,360
If I'm going to be turning on the lights...

3257
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:38,920
Like...

3258
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:39,880
You're going to be there.

3259
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:40,520
You know?

3260
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:40,960
Like...

3261
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,680
So he went...

3262
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,920
You know, he went to the living room too.

3263
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,120
And like he...

3264
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,760
He fucking like sat on his like...

3265
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,560
Dog bed.

3266
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:49,840
And just looked at me.

3267
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:50,200
And I was like...

3268
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,000
Okay, everything's fine.

3269
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:52,180
You're not freaking out anymore.

3270
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:53,800
And then I went to the bathroom.

3271
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:54,980
Went back to bed.

3272
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:56,020
I was like...

3273
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:57,160
And then I went to bed.

3274
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:57,580
And I slept.

3275
01:47:58,060 --> 01:47:59,200
And then like...

3276
01:47:59,200 --> 01:47:59,980
And then I slept.

3277
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,000
And then I remember like...

3278
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,560
My friends are texting me.

3279
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,200
Because like...

3280
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,020
I didn't reply back.

3281
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:05,640
After I was like...

3282
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:06,320
I'm going to...

3283
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:06,900
Because like...

3284
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,420
I was messaging my friends.

3285
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:09,540
And then I was like...

3286
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:10,580
I'm going...

3287
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,760
I need to pee.

3288
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:13,200
I need to use the bathroom.

3289
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,560
So I'm going to go out right now.

3290
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:15,600
And then...

3291
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,020
I didn't give them an update.

3292
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:21,640
I can't...

3293
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:23,020
And so...

3294
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:26,840
I didn't give my friends an update.

3295
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:31,620
I just went straight to bed.

3296
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:39,060
And I woke up and I received like...

3297
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:42,020
Panic messages and like...

3298
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:44,060
Calls and they're like...

3299
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:44,760
Because they're like...

3300
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,560
We thought...

3301
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,160
We thought...

3302
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,720
You didn't know what happened.

3303
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:50,940
That was the last message you sent?

3304
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:51,620
So I...

3305
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:53,260
I was like, I'm so sorry!

3306
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,880
I fell back asleep, I was so tired!

3307
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:04,980
I was like, yeah, I fell, sorry, I fell back asleep!

3308
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,040
Sorry!

3309
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,740
I felt so bad!

3310
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:10,700
No, my god!

3311
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:12,480
Thank you, MagentaSoupa!

3312
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,520
Thank you, thank you!

3313
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:15,780
Um...

3314
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,700
Yeah, yeah, so...

3315
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,580
So, so that happened.

3316
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,820
That's what I'm saying, I've been so fucking unlucky!

3317
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:30,900
Like, apparently now I'm getting haunted?

3318
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:33,720
Like, pick a struggle!

3319
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:39,360
Like, I don't know, send, don't send all this fucking bad luck shit all at once!

3320
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,220
Like, fucking wait a couple of months!

3321
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,100
Now I'm fucking apparently haunted too!

3322
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:51,340
Thank god I'm not living here anymore!

3323
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,320
Um, I'm moving.

3324
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:57,500
I'm literally moving, like, fully next week, so...

3325
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:59,720
Um, good luck to me, I guess!

3326
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:02,420
Um, but I really did miss streaming!

3327
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,440
I really miss streaming for you guys!

3328
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:07,640
And, um, just talking with you guys, hanging out...

3329
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:10,160
Oh my god, it's already been two hours?!

3330
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,660
It did not feel like two hours!

3331
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:15,180
Um...

3332
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:19,160
It definitely did not feel like two hours at all.

3333
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,940
Um, but next week, there's so many exciting things next week!

3334
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:28,080
Um, I'll be having my concert next week with Mint, um, at Anime Revolution, for those who don't know.

3335
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:33,720
Um, it is, it comes, it's free entry, so as long as you have a pass there, it's on the 9th!

3336
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:41,120
So, as long as you have a pass there, um, you basically get in, and like, there's a lot of, um...

3337
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:45,500
There's basically, like, a lot of seats, so you don't have to worry about it.

3338
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:48,240
I also have, like, a meet and greet and panel there as well, so...

3339
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:48,960
Boop boop!

3340
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:49,900
There it is!

3341
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,380
There it is!

3342
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:52,900
We're gonna have a concert!

3343
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:55,700
Let me see, where's the other picture of it?

3344
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:00,560
Where's my pretty, like, straight up Anime Revolution picture?

3345
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:01,620
Is it this one?

3346
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:02,420
No, that's not it.

3347
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:02,920
There's so...

3348
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,900
I've been... There's so many conventions that I'm losing track of time.

3349
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,460
Oh, and then there's Animathon too!

3350
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:09,220
Right after, so...

3351
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:10,080
There you go.

3352
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:10,880
The tomatoes.

3353
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:11,700
Oh, me too!

3354
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:17,740
Anime Revolution, and then right after that, I have, um...

3355
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:19,280
Animathon.

3356
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:21,620
So that's right after.

3357
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:23,600
That's right after that.

3358
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:27,760
Um, and that is in Edmonton.

3359
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:32,420
So there's one in Vancouver, and then the other one is Edmonton in Canada.

3360
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:35,300
So, for you Canadian goons out there.

3361
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:37,100
And then... Yeah!

3362
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:40,900
And then next week, I'll be also doing a Twitch Rival.

3363
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:46,060
I got invited to two different Twitch Rivals, um, next week, but then I rejected one.

3364
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:54,520
And, um, I got invited to the Elden Ring one, but then I said no, because they wanted me to be level 150, um, for it.

3365
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:56,840
I was like, I do not have time to...

3366
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:01,380
My first Elden Ring stream is not for Twitch Rivals.

3367
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:08,660
I literally was like, I cannot do Elden... Like, I'm not doing my first Elden Ring playthrough just for Twitch Rivals.

3368
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:09,580
So...

3369
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:10,940
So...

3370
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:16,240
Yeah, so I was like, yeah, I'm not... I said no, but then I said yes to the Apex one.

3371
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:19,840
So I'll be doing the Apex Twitch Rivals next week.

3372
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:20,540
Um...

3373
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:23,780
So yeah, that's the only thing I have sort of planned.

3374
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:26,520
I don't know what else I'm doing next week, so I'll figure that out.

3375
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:28,180
But I'll figure that out soon.

3376
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:30,520
I always figure stuff out last minute.

3377
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:33,360
Um...

3378
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:34,140
But yes!

3379
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:36,220
That's my current plans, I think.

3380
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,740
Um, but I'll be back to streaming more regularly.

3381
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,040
So there... Look, I was so scared.

3382
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,740
I'll be on break because like, um...

3383
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,560
And he's on Fortnite?

3384
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:46,320
Nothing.

3385
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,140
I think... I don't know what happened.

3386
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:52,740
It has... It's something related to the Fortnite Twitch Rivals event I did.

3387
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:59,000
But like, Doru didn't get... didn't get... kicked out of the creator program.

3388
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,340
So I don't know what happened.

3389
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:05,600
Like, I... Like, Twitch has actually messaged Fortnite for me to ask what's going on.

3390
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:07,040
So I'm just waiting on that.

3391
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,660
Um, I messaged Fortnite myself, but like, no replies.

3392
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:12,320
So like, it's so weird.

3393
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,760
It's actually so weird.

3394
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:19,280
And the thing is, it happened... Like, I did the Rivals event two weeks ago.

3395
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:24,680
And then they... They like, kicked me out of the... They kicked me out of the program two days...

3396
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:25,540
Like, I don't know what day.

3397
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:26,400
Like, three days ago?

3398
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,240
I got kicked out of the program three days ago.

3399
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:32,520
So they waited two weeks to kick me out.

3400
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:35,100
So I was so... Cause if it... If I said something weird...

3401
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:36,620
Or like...

3402
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:38,020
I didn't think I said anything weird.

3403
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:39,600
I just did... I was my normal self.

3404
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:43,580
I was my... I was my normal self in... In the event.

3405
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:44,920
Like, how I usually stream.

3406
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:49,880
And then like... So like, if I did say something weird, it would not take them two weeks.

3407
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:51,160
Um...

3408
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:54,340
Two weeks to like...

3409
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:56,720
Uh... Kick me out of the program.

3410
01:53:57,020 --> 01:53:58,380
Like, I can still use the account.

3411
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,980
I just don't have a creator code.

3412
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:02,700
And I can't do... Um...

3413
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:04,460
I can't do like...

3414
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,900
Uh... Custom servers anymore.

3415
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,300
Um... So like...

3416
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:10,360
And then I messaged support.

3417
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:11,720
I did a support ticket.

3418
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:13,280
And I was like, what happened?

3419
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:14,380
And they're like, we investing...

3420
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,220
And then I got an...

3421
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:16,540
Bot reply.

3422
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:17,260
Because...

3423
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:19,000
When I got my account back.

3424
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:21,200
Like the Fortnite account back a couple months ago.

3425
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,880
I got a real person that signed off their name.

3426
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:24,580
You know?

3427
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:26,660
So like, they would sign their name off.

3428
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:28,700
Saying like a real person.

3429
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,560
Like, replied back.

3430
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:34,120
And I had... Like, I talked to like two real people for that.

3431
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,520
And then...

3432
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:36,080
Um...

3433
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:36,700
But this one.

3434
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:37,880
I got an automate...

3435
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,340
Like, I felt like it was a bot reply.

3436
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:40,640
Because...

3437
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:41,780
Um...

3438
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,500
Because like...

3439
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,400
It didn't got signed off by a real person.

3440
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,600
And then all they said was like, you broke the creator guidelines.

3441
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:49,000
Like the creator TOS.

3442
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:51,080
So I was like, what the fuck?

3443
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:51,580
So I read it.

3444
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:52,780
I was like, I don't know what happened.

3445
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,140
I was just a...

3446
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:55,780
I was doing a regular Fortnite stream.

3447
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:57,120
Like how I've always done them.

3448
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:58,180
And like...

3449
01:54:58,180 --> 01:55:00,860
I'm pretty sure I've said worse things than other Fortnite streams.

3450
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:01,360
Like...

3451
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:03,520
Like...

3452
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,680
I'm pretty sure.

3453
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:05,760
Like...

3454
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:10,660
And it can't be because I said condom skins.

3455
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:11,800
Because...

3456
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:18,500
Because literally the reason why I was taught the terminology of it was because of my duo.

3457
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:21,100
Who said that shit all the time.

3458
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:22,040
Like...

3459
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,840
They were literally saying it with me.

3460
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,520
Like...

3461
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,160
Um...

3462
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:33,500
And then...

3463
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,360
And then...

3464
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:36,840
And then...

3465
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:37,840
And then...

3466
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,140
And then...

3467
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:39,300
And then...

3468
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:39,720
So...

3469
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,280
So then I sent another ticket.

3470
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:47,380
And be like, could you please elaborate what exactly I broke in the creator guidelines?

3471
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:49,140
Because I'm so confused.

3472
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:50,300
And I sent in a VOD.

3473
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:52,000
And be like, my duo was okay.

3474
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:52,620
Like...

3475
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,520
I don't understand.

3476
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:55,800
And then...

3477
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:57,080
Um...

3478
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:58,200
And then...

3479
01:55:58,880 --> 01:55:59,360
Uh...

3480
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,780
And...

3481
01:55:59,780 --> 01:56:00,700
And because I sent a VOD.

3482
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:01,540
Be like, this is my duo.

3483
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:02,480
And everything is okay.

3484
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:03,280
Like, I don't understand.

3485
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:04,880
And then they were like...

3486
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:05,480
Uh...

3487
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:06,040
Oh, sorry.

3488
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:06,660
If you don't understand.

3489
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,080
Then like...

3490
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:09,020
Please check...

3491
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:09,560
Um...

3492
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:10,600
Please check the...

3493
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:12,080
Please check how the...

3494
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:12,820
The guidelines.

3495
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,160
Like, literally almost...

3496
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:15,480
It wasn't the same reply.

3497
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:17,580
But then it was like...

3498
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:18,640
It was like...

3499
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:19,140
Um...

3500
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,000
They just linked...

3501
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,320
They didn't link me the same article.

3502
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,280
It was a different article.

3503
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:25,640
Like the eligibility to be a creator in the creator program.

3504
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:27,020
Um...

3505
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:30,660
The thing is, nothing happened to him.

3506
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:31,520
That's the thing.

3507
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:36,920
Like, if it was something related to like what I did on that stream.

3508
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,120
He would also get affected.

3509
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:41,100
But nothing happened to him.

3510
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:42,640
So I just wanted to see like...

3511
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:44,920
Like, what the f*** was going on.

3512
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:46,420
Um...

3513
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:47,640
And then like...

3514
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:48,640
Yeah.

3515
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:49,540
And then...

3516
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:50,240
And then...

3517
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:50,600
So then...

3518
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:52,380
And then they closed the ticket instantly.

3519
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:54,060
So I couldn't like ask.

3520
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,000
So I had to make a new ticket.

3521
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,160
Uh...

3522
01:56:57,160 --> 01:57:00,300
I had to make a new ticket to ask about it.

3523
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:01,380
Um...

3524
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:03,220
So I was so confused.

3525
01:57:03,580 --> 01:57:04,280
Cause like...

3526
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,420
I was like...

3527
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:05,720
What?

3528
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:06,500
What happened?

3529
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:07,820
Like...

3530
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:10,940
Anyway...

3531
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:12,780
Twitch is trying to see what happened for me.

3532
01:57:12,860 --> 01:57:13,680
Cause they were like...

3533
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:14,240
Cause you know...

3534
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:15,600
It was from their event.

3535
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,580
It was from their event.

3536
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:18,620
So they were like...

3537
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:19,340
Okay, obviously.

3538
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:19,760
You know...

3539
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,900
They didn't want to have that affect me.

3540
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:24,120
Because they were the ones that invited me to the event.

3541
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:24,700
Like I...

3542
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:27,160
The only reason why I joined was because...

3543
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:27,780
Um...

3544
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:29,200
They invited me.

3545
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:29,960
So...

3546
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:30,280
Twitch...

3547
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:31,400
Twitch staff is gonna like...

3548
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:31,980
It's like...

3549
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,440
Already sent a message out to the Fortnite team.

3550
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:35,580
To see like...

3551
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:36,660
What the fuck happened.

3552
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:37,760
Like...

3553
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,740
Like...

3554
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:40,260
I don't fucking know.

3555
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,740
Cause I don't think we're getting our Fortnite skin, guys.

3556
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:43,180
I don't...

3557
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:45,120
Guys...

3558
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:46,100
I'm in the...

3559
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:46,800
Guys...

3560
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:47,420
I'm in the...

3561
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:47,840
For...

3562
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:48,660
My...

3563
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:49,820
My...

3564
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:50,600
My...

3565
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:55,360
Me getting kicked out of the creative program is gonna be on my permanent record.

3566
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:57,680
No...

3567
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:58,500
No...

3568
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:58,640
No...

3569
01:57:58,640 --> 01:57:59,220
No...

3570
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,520
Guys...

3571
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:05,020
It's gonna be on my permanent record.

3572
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:08,160
I'm not gonna get sent to college now!!!

3573
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:11,320
What will the university see?

3574
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:12,980
Will they see my report card?

3575
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:17,820
Um...

3576
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:20,200
Um...

3577
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:20,480
Um...

3578
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,080
So...

3579
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:23,440
I don't fucking know what happened.

3580
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:24,300
Like...

3581
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:29,200
They're lost on a podcast.

3582
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:30,260
Potential Market.

3583
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:38,040
But yeah, what was I talking about before the Fortnite shit?

3584
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:39,120
I don't remember.

3585
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,200
What was I...

3586
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:44,960
Because I wanted to talk about something else and I went into the Fortnite tangent.

3587
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:50,260
What was I talking about before the Fortnite stuff?

3588
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:51,220
I forgot to.

3589
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:51,920
I forgot.

3590
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:52,860
I forgot.

3591
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:54,500
No idea.

3592
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:55,680
I remember.

3593
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:56,780
No, no, no, no.

3594
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:58,020
No, no, no.

3595
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:00,060
It was after the paranormal activity.

3596
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:02,740
It was after the being haunted thing.

3597
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:04,520
I mean, I'm moving out of here.

3598
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:07,660
So like, good luck to the next tenant.

3599
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:11,260
Unless it follows me home.

3600
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,580
Then that's... that'll be an issue.

3601
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,920
That'll definitely be an issue.

3602
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:16,300
Oh yeah.

3603
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:17,500
Oh yeah, I'll be in the...

3604
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:23,220
Was I really talking about just Twitch Rivals before I got distracted?

3605
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:25,080
Okay, anyway, I'll be at the Twitch Rivals.

3606
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:26,260
The schedule.

3607
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:31,280
Yeah, I haven't decided anything in my schedule other than the Twitch Rivals thing that I agreed to do.

3608
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,380
Blow my nose real quick.

3609
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:35,020
Give me a sec.

3610
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,020
I'm extra stuffy right now.

3611
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:44,460
But other than that...

3612
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:50,940
Yeah, nothing else planned.

3613
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,380
It's like... it's a draft system.

3614
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:56,440
So like the usual Twitch Rivals for Apex.

3615
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:58,720
They draft people for like...

3616
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,880
Like a snake-wise way.

3617
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,220
I don't know how to explain it.

3618
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:02,760
I'm not a captain.

3619
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:04,760
They were like, oh, what's your rank?

3620
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:05,360
And I was like, plat.

3621
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:13,980
I said don't play Apex often enough to justify my rank being high.

3622
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:15,240
They're like, okay.

3623
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:16,200
And I was like, yay.

3624
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:25,500
Um...

3625
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:26,860
Yeah.

3626
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:28,060
Uh...

3627
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:29,700
Yes, my PC is fixed.

3628
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:31,000
It has an AMD card now.

3629
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:31,800
Um...

3630
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:34,240
Also another reason why I didn't stream for a bit was because...

3631
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:35,320
You know, I was getting...

3632
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,340
I can't believe...

3633
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:38,940
I can't believe I lost to 50-50 twice.

3634
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:40,300
Because apparently...

3635
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:42,180
Because you know, my old PC is also Intel.

3636
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:46,700
And see, Intel was a 13th gen that had issues.

3637
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,100
And then...

3638
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:51,420
So like, obviously, I lost to 50-50 for that too.

3639
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:54,660
Because like, it's a 50% chance it's gonna...

3640
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:55,480
Sorry, CPU.

3641
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:56,460
I like to say card.

3642
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:57,900
Because I like...

3643
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:58,500
I don't know.

3644
02:00:58,640 --> 02:00:59,000
It's just...

3645
02:00:59,000 --> 02:00:59,800
It's just reflex.

3646
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:00,760
Because I'm always...

3647
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:03,400
Because usually in the past, it was my GPU that was the issue.

3648
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:04,940
So I always like to say card.

3649
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:06,680
But now it's my, like, CPU.

3650
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,780
So, like, um...

3651
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:10,700
My old PC, it wasn't...

3652
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:12,920
It was Intel 13th gen.

3653
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:16,100
This PC was 14th gen.

3654
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:18,720
And it has a 50% chance of failing.

3655
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:20,340
Guess who f...

3656
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:27,500
Guess who f...

3657
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,160
Fucked up the gacha twice in a row.

3658
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,280
Like...

3659
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:37,760
So...

3660
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:43,300
So I lost the coin flip in the 13th gen.

3661
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:46,380
And the 14th gen.

3662
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:48,480
That's why...

3663
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,860
That's why I've been, like, blue-screening.

3664
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:52,420
Because my...

3665
02:01:52,420 --> 02:01:54,140
My Intel card...

3666
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:56,620
My Intel CPU kept playing...

3667
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:58,060
Like, going crazy.

3668
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:01,040
So, yeah.

3669
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:02,020
I'm on AMD now.

3670
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:03,720
And I changed my motherboard as well.

3671
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:05,140
So...

3672
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:06,240
So, yeah!

3673
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:08,800
So, hopefully...

3674
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:11,220
Hopefully, we won't...

3675
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:14,480
We won't, like, go through another...

3676
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:17,140
We won't go through some PC problems...

3677
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:18,000
For now.

3678
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:19,040
I don't know.

3679
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:20,680
My luck has been really terrible lately.

3680
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:21,900
Like I said, like...

3681
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:22,340
My...

3682
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:25,780
My luck has been incredibly bad.

3683
02:02:26,620 --> 02:02:26,940
So...

3684
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:28,600
So, like...

3685
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:29,200
Who knows?

3686
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:31,100
I...

3687
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:31,900
I...

3688
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:32,720
Okay.

3689
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,540
I had another bad luck experience.

3690
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:37,620
Um...

3691
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:38,760
Uh...

3692
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,720
I had another, like, bad luck experience.

3693
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:42,380
Uh...

3694
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:43,060
For...

3695
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:44,140
What was it?

3696
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:44,480
Yesterday?

3697
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:44,920
Yesterday?

3698
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:46,700
Because I was, like...

3699
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:47,460
Um...

3700
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:49,860
I was, like...

3701
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:50,660
Trying to...

3702
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:51,920
Trying to get, like...

3703
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:52,700
Uh...

3704
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:54,760
I was trying to get, like...

3705
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:55,720
Uh...

3706
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:56,820
Uh...

3707
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:58,600
The elevator booked and stuff.

3708
02:02:58,860 --> 02:02:59,600
For, like...

3709
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:00,900
Like, for moving stuff.

3710
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:02,540
So, I was trying to get the elevator booked.

3711
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,520
And then, they were, like...

3712
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:05,420
Oh, sorry.

3713
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:07,980
You have to...

3714
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:09,500
Because, like...

3715
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:10,420
At first...

3716
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:11,000
But, like...

3717
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:11,720
It worked out.

3718
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:12,720
It worked out in the end.

3719
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:13,560
Because I...

3720
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:14,580
I, like...

3721
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:15,860
I lied a little bit.

3722
02:03:16,060 --> 02:03:16,480
But, like...

3723
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:17,000
It worked out.

3724
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,260
It was a white lie.

3725
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,060
And I was desperate.

3726
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:20,020
So...

3727
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:20,840
Because, like...

3728
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:21,080
Okay.

3729
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:21,620
So...

3730
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:22,900
Basically...

3731
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:23,620
Um...

3732
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:24,860
I was, like...

3733
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:25,640
I need a...

3734
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:26,500
I need a move.

3735
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:27,640
So, you're right.

3736
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:30,000
So, you need to book the elevator for it.

3737
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:31,360
Because I'm not fucking taking the stairs.

3738
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:32,580
Because I live too high up.

3739
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:33,480
And then...

3740
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:34,100
And then...

3741
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:34,620
So, like...

3742
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,240
I went...

3743
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:36,220
And was, like...

3744
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:37,240
Hey, I need to book the elevator.

3745
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:38,440
I talked to, like...

3746
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:39,080
Um...

3747
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:40,400
The person in charge for it.

3748
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:41,440
And then, they were, like...

3749
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,180
Yeah, that's no problem.

3750
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:43,440
This date and this time.

3751
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:43,660
I was, like...

3752
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:44,160
Yeah, that's great.

3753
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:45,440
And I went back up.

3754
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,480
Went to take a nap.

3755
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:48,680
Because I was fucking tired.

3756
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:51,880
I'm always tired these days now.

3757
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:52,880
Because everything is so boring.

3758
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:53,260
Things a lot.

3759
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:54,240
And then...

3760
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,260
They were, like...

3761
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:55,860
Oh!

3762
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:57,380
They tried to call.

3763
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:57,960
And then, like...

3764
02:03:57,960 --> 02:03:58,620
A couple of...

3765
02:03:58,620 --> 02:03:59,900
A couple of, like...

3766
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:00,300
Uh...

3767
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:00,980
Hours passed.

3768
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:02,120
And then, they called me.

3769
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:03,020
But I don't take calls.

3770
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:03,860
Because, like...

3771
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:06,340
I don't fucking know who the fuck calls these days.

3772
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,320
So, like...

3773
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:11,620
If they really want me to answer, they would text me or...

3774
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:14,020
Or leave a voicemail.

3775
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:20,780
Because if they're that desperate to reach me, they would leave a voicemail.

3776
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:21,780
So, like...

3777
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:22,040
They call...

3778
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:23,400
Like, three...

3779
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:23,760
Four...

3780
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:24,020
Three...

3781
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:24,320
Because, like...

3782
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:24,960
Usually, it's spam.

3783
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:26,680
Usually, it's fucking spam.

3784
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:28,700
Like, telemarketers or robocallers.

3785
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:29,700
So...

3786
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:30,420
Um...

3787
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:31,240
You know, they...

3788
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:33,860
I was sleeping and I woke up because I got called, like, three times.

3789
02:04:34,380 --> 02:04:35,140
And then...

3790
02:04:35,140 --> 02:04:35,980
And then, like...

3791
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:38,360
And then, the fourth time, they left a voicemail.

3792
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:38,820
And they're, like...

3793
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:39,820
We're so sorry.

3794
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:40,480
We...

3795
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:44,660
Please call us back because we can't do your appointment because you have to do it online!

3796
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:46,940
And, like...

3797
02:04:46,940 --> 02:04:47,320
They're, like...

3798
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:50,700
You have to give, like, X amount of times notice for it.

3799
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:52,800
So, I was, like...

3800
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:55,760
Because, like, the day I requested it, it was already past the deadline.

3801
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:58,000
Um...

3802
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,960
And then, I was, like, are you fucking kidding me?

3803
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:02,540
So, I told a white lie.

3804
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:10,200
I called them back.

3805
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:12,460
I was, like, I'm so sorry.

3806
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:13,660
I already paid the movie.

3807
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:17,320
So, I can't change the date.

3808
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:19,000
They're coming here regardless!

3809
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:26,060
I ended up paying the movers the day after I got the call.

3810
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:38,000
So I was like, dude, I already paid it.

3811
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:42,140
So like, unless you're giving me the refund, like I can't change it.

3812
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,180
They're gonna be here regardless.

3813
02:05:46,940 --> 02:05:49,060
So, thing is, I haven't paid them yet.

3814
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:50,220
They were closed.

3815
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:59,480
I was paying... I was gonna pay them the day after because they were closed.

3816
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:04,680
So I had... like I held the appointment, but...

3817
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:09,180
I held the appointment, but it wasn't fully confirmed.

3818
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:12,240
And... so...

3819
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:18,100
So obviously, the person... they were like, oh shit.

3820
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:21,220
And they're gonna... well...

3821
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:25,900
They're like, oh, okay, we don't really have anybody moving out on that date.

3822
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:27,960
So like, you should be fine.

3823
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:29,200
Like, that's fine.

3824
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,360
Just... that's fine.

3825
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:37,040
I mean, nobody was moving out on that date!

3826
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:46,460
I don't... like... who... I'm sorry that you... the paper... like the fucking... like the bureaucracy about it.

3827
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:48,760
Like, nobody was moving out.

3828
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:50,400
Out on that date anyway.

3829
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:52,200
It shouldn't matter.

3830
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:55,960
It's just they need the fucking paperwork processed.

3831
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:02,720
So it's like... it doesn't hurt anybody.

3832
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:10,320
But yeah, I was able to book the elevator.

3833
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,300
Yay!

3834
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,120
Yeah, like it worked out in the end.

3835
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:19,060
It worked out.

3836
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:21,380
Like, everything was okay.

3837
02:07:21,660 --> 02:07:23,060
So... yippee!

3838
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:26,860
It worked.

3839
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:28,100
It didn't hurt anybody.

3840
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:29,740
The lie didn't hurt anybody.

3841
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:31,780
I just...

3842
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:35,020
I beat the system!

3843
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:37,140
And that's all that matters.

3844
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:38,520
I beat the system.

3845
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:44,560
Yeah, no fucking online shit is gonna... gonna ruin my fucking move.

3846
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:45,420
Like...

3847
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:49,940
Alright, guys.

3848
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:51,880
Alright, I've been talking for two hours.

3849
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:52,800
So I'm gonna call it here.

3850
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:56,580
I'm gonna post my schedule either later today or tomorrow.

3851
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:57,560
So we'll see.

3852
02:07:58,220 --> 02:07:58,740
Um...

3853
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,380
Um, so... but...

3854
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:03,220
It was great being back again.

3855
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,340
I was so worried!

3856
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:05,620
Because, you know...

3857
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:10,960
I basically took like two... like one... a week break the week before.

3858
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:14,000
So like... and then I took another week break this week.

3859
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,740
So I was super fucking worried.

3860
02:08:15,740 --> 02:08:16,620
Because I was like...

3861
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:17,220
Oh no!

3862
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:18,860
What if dragoons forgot about...

3863
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:20,960
Taking a break as a content creator is always so scary.

3864
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:23,480
Like... and everybody knows I'm not one to take breaks.

3865
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:24,800
Um...

3866
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:25,860
So like...

3867
02:08:25,860 --> 02:08:27,060
I was obviously very scared.

3868
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:27,580
Because I was like...

3869
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:29,600
What if the dragoons forgot about me?

3870
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:31,040
Ahhhh!

3871
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:34,000
What if they've already moved on?

3872
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:38,180
So I'm really happy to be back!

3873
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:40,040
And I miss you guys a lot.

3874
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,500
I really... I really did miss you guys.

3875
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:42,220
I love streaming.

3876
02:08:42,920 --> 02:08:43,360
Um...

3877
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:44,580
I love streaming.

3878
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:45,420
And...

3879
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:47,440
I'm just glad to stream for you guys again.

3880
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:48,320
And just talk to you guys.

3881
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:49,180
It really means a lot.

3882
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:51,440
For so many people to be here.

3883
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:53,180
So many people to be here.

3884
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:54,120
Um...

3885
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:55,380
For my back stream.

3886
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:56,720
It really means a lot.

3887
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:57,740
Um...

3888
02:08:57,740 --> 02:08:59,840
And thank you everybody for the super chats.

3889
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,020
And...

3890
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:02,940
And the...

3891
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:03,780
Gifted ships.

3892
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:05,440
And joining the membership.

3893
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:06,380
And subscribing.

3894
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:07,500
Oh my god!

3895
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:08,480
By the way...

3896
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:11,400
I'm out of the shorts algorithm.

3897
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:12,520
Like...

3898
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:14,080
Who is this strange...

3899
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:16,920
Who is this strange yellow creature?

3900
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:18,260
Thank you for the super chat, Rice.

3901
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:18,680
Thank you.

3902
02:09:18,700 --> 02:09:19,160
Thank you.

3903
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:20,240
I'm unfortunate.

3904
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:22,580
I need to get back onto the shorts algorithm.

3905
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:24,760
Because I haven't uploaded...

3906
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:25,880
I didn't upload...

3907
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:28,740
It fucking sucks if I don't upload shorts consistently.

3908
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,500
I'm out of the algorithm just like that.

3909
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:33,080
I need them to know I'm alive.

3910
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:34,320
I need...

3911
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:37,940
I need the shorts algorithm to know I'm alive.

3912
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:40,320
I'm sorry, YouTube.

3913
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:43,180
I'm sorry I have a life.

3914
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:43,820
Like...

3915
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:48,560
So, I need to get back into the algorithm for shorts.

3916
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:50,920
Anyway, I'm gonna call it here.

3917
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,640
I still have lots of packing to do.

3918
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:55,120
So, thank you everybody for welcoming back.

3919
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:56,980
And for the red carpet for the super chats.

3920
02:09:57,140 --> 02:09:59,180
I'll try to have a super chat reading in the future.

3921
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,080
Because there's so much super chats today.

3922
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,020
Guys, it was moving so expensive.

3923
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:05,900
There's so many expenses.

3924
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:07,760
Like boxes.

3925
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:08,980
And...

3926
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:09,660
Um...

3927
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:11,600
Boxes.

3928
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:13,060
And moving companies.

3929
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:14,360
And cleaning.

3930
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,720
And the internet.

3931
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:19,900
And then like f***ing electricity?

3932
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:26,560
Oh my god.

3933
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:27,540
I...

3934
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:28,900
The expenses.

3935
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:30,400
Internet.

3936
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:31,800
I'm so...

3937
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:32,260
Okay.

3938
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:39,040
This is how little knowledge I knew about like being like a tenant.

3939
02:10:39,180 --> 02:10:40,840
You have to pay a deposit?

3940
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,400
And rent?

3941
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,560
Because like...

3942
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:45,080
Okay.

3943
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:46,200
Because I paid...

3944
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:50,740
I didn't realize the deposit was different from rent.

3945
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:52,800
Just like I paid the deposit.

3946
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:54,740
And then I was like...

3947
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:55,280
Yippee!

3948
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:56,860
And...

3949
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:59,220
Because it was a lot.

3950
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:01,480
The deposit was a lot.

3951
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:02,700
And then...

3952
02:11:02,700 --> 02:11:04,260
And then like...

3953
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:04,820
And then...

3954
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:05,260
And then...

3955
02:11:05,260 --> 02:11:06,820
The real agent was like...

3956
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:07,800
Hey, Doki.

3957
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:09,300
We still need the rent.

3958
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:11,120
You haven't paid the rent.

3959
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:12,160
And I was like...

3960
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:13,000
But I did.

3961
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:14,120
Like...

3962
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:14,320
I...

3963
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,680
I paid so much.

3964
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:17,040
And then like...

3965
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:17,460
No.

3966
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:18,960
You have...

3967
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:21,040
That's the deposit.

3968
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:22,920
You got to pay that same amount.

3969
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:25,980
But for like this month's rent.

3970
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:27,500
I was like...

3971
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:28,660
Oh...

3972
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:30,240
The thing is...

3973
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:32,880
The thing is...

3974
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:34,600
Like...

3975
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:39,080
I reached the limit of my e-transfer.

3976
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:41,080
For those who don't know what e-transfer is...

3977
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:41,100
I'm not going to tell you what it is.

3978
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:42,200
Because I think it was like...

3979
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:42,580
It's a...

3980
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:43,960
It's a Canadian thing.

3981
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:45,280
So, like, it's basically...

3982
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,080
It's like...

3983
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:47,860
You know, it's like a wire transfer.

3984
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:48,420
But electronically.

3985
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:49,660
So...

3986
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:51,020
So, I was like...

3987
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:54,000
I reached the limit of my e-transfer.

3988
02:11:54,280 --> 02:11:54,880
And...

3989
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:58,000
I'm sorry, I need to wait 24 hours.

3990
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:01,760
I was like...

3991
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:02,700
I need a week!

3992
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,260
I need to wait 24 hours.

3993
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:05,700
Please.

3994
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:09,600
Is it okay if we wait 24 hours?

3995
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:10,980
Another request?

3996
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:11,580
There it is!

3997
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:17,740
And they're like, oh yeah, yeah, just like, um, just like, tell them.

3998
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:18,680
You know?

3999
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:19,680
Just...

4000
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:24,260
Just like, tell them, you know, in the... in the...

4001
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:27,400
In the... like, in the text.

4002
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:28,580
I was like, okay!

4003
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:35,880
So, that's basically...

4004
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:38,660
That's basically what happened.

4005
02:12:38,660 --> 02:12:40,260
But it's a lot.

4006
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:41,060
It's...

4007
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:42,440
It's a lot.

4008
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:48,820
I know we can't, like...

4009
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:53,480
I'm glad I told that story because I'm supposed to e-transfer the rent now.

4010
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:55,900
Like, cause the 24 hours is up.

4011
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:57,460
But yeah!

4012
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:58,380
Anyway guys!

4013
02:12:58,800 --> 02:12:59,780
Thank you everybody!

4014
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:02,560
I really appreciate the support because...

4015
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:07,960
Knowing... Now that, like, I know exactly how much...

4016
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:08,640
Guys, this is...

4017
02:13:08,660 --> 02:13:09,580
This is why I'm saying...

4018
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:12,960
If you had a choice between moving or not moving...

4019
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:13,580
Don't move.

4020
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:13,940
Just...

4021
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:15,560
Just... I guess just stay there forever.

4022
02:13:15,780 --> 02:13:16,540
You live there now.

4023
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:17,800
Cause like...

4024
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:18,340
Oh my god.

4025
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:19,300
This is...

4026
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:20,700
That's a struggle.

4027
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:22,900
Really, I'm just like...

4028
02:13:22,900 --> 02:13:23,840
Oh my god.

4029
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:24,860
I should...

4030
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:26,140
I'm just like...

4031
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:26,920
I'm just like...

4032
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:28,360
No wonder people buy homes.

4033
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:29,980
This is fucking torture.

4034
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:31,040
Like...

4035
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:32,780
Like, I was just...

4036
02:13:33,610 --> 02:13:35,740
This is... This is fucking terrible.

4037
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:38,640
No wonder people have homes where they live there.

4038
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:38,820
Forever.

4039
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:40,340
And they die there.

4040
02:13:40,640 --> 02:13:41,380
Cause it...

4041
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:42,960
It's just more convenient.

4042
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:45,200
It's so much more convenient.

4043
02:13:45,580 --> 02:13:47,620
Why the fuck am I living in an apartment?

4044
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:53,100
Also, like, imagine buying a house in my area.

4045
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,300
Bro, fucking every...

4046
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:56,320
All the houses are owned by Airbnb people.

4047
02:13:56,660 --> 02:13:57,460
Fuck Airbnb.

4048
02:13:58,180 --> 02:13:58,660
Anyway...

4049
02:13:58,660 --> 02:13:59,000
Anyway...

4050
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,660
I need to go now.

4051
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:02,800
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

4052
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:03,620
Posture check.

4053
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:05,680
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4054
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:07,120
And if you stay up for me...

4055
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:07,940
Head to bed.

4056
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:09,400
Cause you deserve it.

4057
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:10,480
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

4058
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:11,920
Bye guys.

4059
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:12,940
Bye.
