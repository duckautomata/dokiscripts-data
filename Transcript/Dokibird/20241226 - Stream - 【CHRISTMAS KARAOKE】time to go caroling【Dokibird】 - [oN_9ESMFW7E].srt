1
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,580
Wow, oh shit, sorry, give me a sec.

2
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,540
I already messed it up.

3
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,560
Sorry, I'm a mess right now.

4
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,480
Give me a sec, just pretend you didn't see that, guys.

5
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,920
Pretend you didn't see that.

6
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,540
Woah, let's start, let's start that all over.

7
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,580
Let's rerun that real quick, guys.

8
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,260
Let's rerun that.

9
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,360
Alright, sorry, rerun time.

10
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,860
Let's pretend none of that happened.

11
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,920
What a great start to Christmas.

12
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,860
Sorry, I'm like not okay right now.

13
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,640
I like have to put all of this together.

14
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,300
Pretend none of that happened.

15
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,460
Woah, rerun time.

16
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,800
Round three.

17
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,670
Hey.

18
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,330
Dragons, open the door!

19
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,390
It's Christmas!

20
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,270
Woah!

21
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,610
What do you mean?

22
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,690
You know what that means, dragons?

23
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,830
Come on, open the door!

24
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,450
Open the door!

25
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,430
You really gonna spend Christmas all alone there?

26
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,850
Come on, dragons.

27
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,350
Merry Christmas, everybody.

28
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,390
Stranger danger!

29
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,190
I look like the most trustworthy person here.

30
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,430
You wanna play some Marble Rivals?

31
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,690
Come on, dragons.

32
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,170
Come on, let's do a Latin party at my place with some Marble Rivals.

33
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,190
Please, there's a bird outside who wants to play Marble Rivals.

34
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,310
Come on, dragons.

35
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,310
Come on!

36
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,610
Good knock on the glass.

37
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,210
Come on!

38
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,610
Come on!

39
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,850
Come on!

40
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,070
Come on!

41
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,510
Let me in!

42
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,870
Let me in, dragon!

43
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,690
Please, I beg of you, open the door.

44
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,870
The fun for Toki's Marble Rivals.

45
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,790
More pausing in the super chat.

46
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,190
Thank you, thank you.

47
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,490
Oh my god, it'll be great.

48
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,070
Dragons, get in here!

49
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,630
Come here!

50
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:01,730
Come here!

51
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,710
Oh my god, thank you.

52
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,070
Wait, let me in, sorry.

53
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,390
I realized I forgot all my stuff.

54
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,510
Okay, just pretend that the door was already closed.

55
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,870
And then I'll be more immersive.

56
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,970
And be like, wow!

57
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,400
I really appreciate it!

58
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,020
Thanks!

59
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,560
Sorry, I opened the door myself just then.

60
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
But like, don't worry.

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,940
I was polite enough to let you close the door.

62
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,960
And reopen the door for me.

63
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,620
There's some weak dragons there that opened the door before.

64
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,600
Yeah, I kicked off the door before you could do anything.

65
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,020
But I was polite enough to let you close the door.

66
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,340
And then, you know, let you open the door yourself.

67
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,780
Because it was your choice.

68
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,440
So do not worry.

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,740
Oh my god, Merry Christmas everybody!

70
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,600
I actually had like a whole other thing that I really wanted to set up.

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,940
I was setting up everything.

72
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,200
And I realized I forgot the one most crucial thing.

73
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,800
For the entire setup.

74
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,420
Which was you guys looking through the eye hole.

75
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,560
And then seeing like this eye hole vision.

76
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,800
Because I got inspired by this VTuber named Shindigs.

77
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,840
I think that's their name.

78
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,780
And they were doing like that shindags.

79
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,220
And they were doing this like Christmas caroling.

80
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,500
And I asked them how they did the door.

81
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,960
The eye door effect on their stream.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,860
And then I was like.

83
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,160
Oh my god, I'm gonna do it.

84
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,820
And I did all of this and I forgot to do that.

85
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,100
Because they gave me a tutorial on how to do it.

86
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,960
And then, well they didn't give me a tutorial.

87
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,300
They were like, I'll write you a tutorial in two days.

88
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
But I messaged them this morning.

89
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,580
And then they were like.

90
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,200
So they were like, I'll give you a tutorial in two days.

91
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,000
But here are the plugins.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,940
So I was gonna figure it out today.

93
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,700
And then I was like, I set up all of this.

94
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,540
And then I realized.

95
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,060
That was the one thing I forgot to set up.

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,780
Alright, immersion broken.

97
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,260
Sorry, back to the roleplay.

98
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,460
Merry Christmas, Dragoons.

99
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,980
What I just said was nothing.

100
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,700
Ignore everything I just said in the beginning.

101
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,080
Dragoons.

102
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,800
This is all real.

103
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,060
This is all real.

104
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,920
Ignore everything.

105
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,920
Do not wake up.

106
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,500
It's not a dream.

107
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,880
Do not wake up.

108
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,560
Get back in here.

109
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,740
Merry Christmas, everybody.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,840
Merry Christmas.

111
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,900
Hello.

112
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,620

I am a local caroler going door by door to give you some local Christmas cheer.

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:59,660
So I'm very excited to be, I'm just a poor old caroler trying to make sure everybody has a very merry Christmas.

117
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm not here I'm not here to like convert you to any churches or like make you buy anything or anything.

118
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:20,320
I just want to spread some Christmas cheer and sing you some archives.

119
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
Sorry, it was reflex when I said unarchived.

120
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:31,780
Some Christmas holiday songs that will be staying on my channel for the rest of its life.

121
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,140
Channel?

122
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,440
What do you mean by channel?

123
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,440
We're at your door, at your house.

124
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,180
Sorry, sorry, that was just a slip of tongue.

125
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,500
I didn't take my meds today.

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,160
There's no, I'm just a humble Christmas caroler here to sing you some Christmas songs.

127
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,820
Are we on camera?

128
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
No, no, no.

129
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,720
No, of course not.

130
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,900
No, no, no.

131
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,200
You're not on camera.

132
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:05,060
I'm just here to sing you some Christmas songs so you can have a good holiday, sir.

133
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,020
That's really, please don't close the door, please.

134
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,040
This is all I have.

135
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,840
No, please, dragons.

136
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,240
Please.

137
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,900
JK, don't go, please.

138
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,080
That was called the bad ending.

139
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,600
What do you mean good ending?

140
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,180
You waited an hour just for a god damn 10 minute stream?

141
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,520
You really wanted to wait an hour just for a 10 minute stream?

142
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,540
Really, dragon?

143
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,960
Good ending.

144
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,100
Now she's free to do Marvel Rivals.

145
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,640

You don't see the boombox right now because it's literally at my feet.

160
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,510

This is all free!

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,350
Okay, this is free entertainment, Mr. Dragoon.

And you're gonna get all cocky with me right now.

It's a tiny portable boombox, okay guys?

180
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,770
It's a goddamn portable boombox.

181
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,230
I don't know what you want from me.

182
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,930
I'm literally, I'm literally dead.

183
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,770
Immersion restored.

00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,350

I'm ready.

195
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,670
I don't know what, let me know if the instrumental's okay.

196
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,390
Alright, here we go.

Sorry, I'm a great Christmas carer.

199
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:20,810
The most famous reindeer of all Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose.

200
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,870
Who knows about the intro?

201
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:40,930
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows All of the other reindeers used to laugh and call him names They never let poor old Rudolf join in any reindeer games.

202
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,830
God, I wanna eat them.

203
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:55,350
Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say Rudolf with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

204
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:02,370
Then how the reindeers loved him cause he feezed now, as they shouted out with dearly Goddamn cloud chasers.

Busking is very hard.

238
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,180
Oh my god, it's a tough world out there.

239
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,740
Uh, yeah, I put some of my money in there myself, um, to make it seem like a lot of people were tipping me.

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,980
So you know how, like, people would... they won't make an empty jar?

241
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:00,900
The busker would, like, put, like, a little bit of cash in there so people would think, like, there's actual, um...

Sorry.

258
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,660
There we go.

00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,140
Ooh, this one sounds nicer.

260
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,840
Sorry, my boombox was messing up.

261
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,620
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

262
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,760
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

263
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,160
Yeah!

264
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,180
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

265
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,360
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

266
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,740
Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh.

267
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,760
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way.

268
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,340
Ha-ha!

269
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,260
Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright.

270
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,380
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.

271
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,840
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

272
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,060
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

273
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,480
Whoa!

274
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,440
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

275
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,720
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

276
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,760
Yeah!

277
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:51,860
Woo!

278
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,860
A day or two ago...

279
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,080
You didn't think there'd be a second chorus, right?

280
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,340
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated at my side.

281
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,180
Who the fuck is she?

282
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,880
The horse was lean and lank, Miss Fortune seen his lot.

283
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,880
He slipped upon a drifting bank and then we got upset.

284
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,700
Did she die?

285
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,560
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

286
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,700
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

287
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,020
Woo!

288
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,120
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

289
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,580
Sorry, I had to, like, breathe.

290
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,100
One-horse open sleigh.

291
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,740
Look, I'm just a caroler.

292
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,200
Alright, thank you.

293
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,680
That is what five dollars of singing gets you.

294
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,100
Whoa!

295
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,740
Sorry, my boombox is messing up right now.

296
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,620
Alright, that's what five dollars of singing gets you.

297
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,040
Pay for the carol.

298
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,620
Guys, that's when you know it's not pre-recorded.

299
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,700
Guys, caroling, sir.

300
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,380
That's when you know it's not pre-recorded, sir.

301
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,370
Me, I'm doing it all live.

302
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,510
With just me and my boombox.

303
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,350
Okay?

304
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,010
Me and my boombox back there.

305
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,610
Wham!

306
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,290
Last Christmas, I'd cry.

307
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,290
Okay, alright.

308
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,910
Never sang that before.

309
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,870
Let's see how hard that is.

310
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,370
Uh, Kaiser, thank you for the magenta soup.

311
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,110
Thank you.

312
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,950
We're just... Oh my god, there's a Taylor Swift version?

313
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,190
There's an Ariana...

314
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,350
Sorry, my boombox has a lot of songs in there.

315
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,030
It's like an Apple boombox.

316
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,910
So like, I get access...

317
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,230
I have Spotify on my boombox right now.

318
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,290
So...

319
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,470
Alright, let's see what does this sound like.

320
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,190
Oh man.

321
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,890
What the... Oh my god.

322
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,110
Last Christmas...

323
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,190
Sorry, I like skimmed through.

324
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,910
Wait, let's get a Taylor Swift version.

325
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,790
On my Spotify boombox.

326
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,450
Like, okay.

327
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,190
Okay, do you want to be more immersive?

328
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,350
Alright, give me a sec so we know...

329
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,750
We know exactly that it is...

330
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,730
Oh my god, it's like country.

331
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,130
Okay.

332
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,450
That it is a Spotify...

333
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,350
Um, sir, this is a Spotify boombox.

334
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:22,830
Um...

335
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,390

336
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,590
It costs...

337
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,970
I actually googled Spotify boombox on my phone, by the way.

338
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,550
Like, I have my phone with me while I'm Christmas caroling.

339
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,350
And everything...

340
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:33,810
No!

341
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,810
Oh my god, there's an Ariana Grande on my Spotify boom...

342
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,530
Okay, look.

343
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,490
Sir, do you really want to see the license on my boombox?

344
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,530
It is 100% from...

345
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:47,970
Um...

346
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,810
From Spotify.

347
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,490
I'll show you right now.

348
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,970
Uh, give me a sec.

349
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,130
I did not just print this out on my...

350
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,850
Print this out and attached it onto my boombox.

351
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,890
Like, I would never do something that stupid.

352
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:00,790
Um...

353
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,630
Sir, this is my Spotify boombox.

354
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,030
Alright?

355
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,830
Like, it costs a lot of money.

356
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:10,550
Okay?

357
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,030
So, like, I need you to know that, um...

358
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:19,310
I am able to access a lot of my favorite songs on my Spotify boombox.

359
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:25,950
So we can do my Christmas caroling.

360
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:26,710
Okay?

361
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,670
So please, don't think it's not fake.

362
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,750
It's all real.

363
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,890
I am actually outside your door right now.

364
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,870
Trying to make ends meet here.

365
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,090
There you go.

366
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,410
Now you see the Spotify logo as well.

367
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,110
So...

368
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,990
Um, look.

369
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,830
It's Christmas.

370
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,330
I'm trying to make ends meet.

371
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,310
I have a lot of children to feed.

372
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,770
Um, I have...

373
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,390
I have a family and everything.

374
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,570
So please, I'm trying my best here.

375
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:56,290
I'm...

376
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,730
I'm trying...

377
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,770
Please play the WAM version, man.

378
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,230
Noxbob, thank you for the magenta soup.

379
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,090
Thank you.

380
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,010
Thank you.

381
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:05,450
Where's...

382
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:05,910
That's the...

383
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,750
What does the WAM version sound like?

384
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,450
Alright, Spotify boombox.

385
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,550
Show me what it sounds like.

386
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:13,690
Okay.

387
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,370
What is this?

388
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,850
As made famous by WAM.

389
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,130
Wait, there's like a guy and a girl singing this.

390
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,950
Alright, I'm having them sing with me.

391
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,050
Also, I never...

392
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,570
Oh, I can bring up the instrument a little bit.

393
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,650
Okay, don't worry.

394
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,370
I'll bring it up.

395
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,510
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

396
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,670
But the very next day, you gave it away.

397
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,950
This year, you saved me from tears.

398
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,870
I'll give it to someone special.

399
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,570
Wait, wait.

400
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,170
Stop.

401
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,050
Sorry.

402
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,590
I have an idea.

403
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,040
Sorry, sir.

404
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,780
Give me a sec.

405
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,600
I got...

406
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,220
Sorry, let me bring one of my kids over.

407
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,300
I got...

408
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,940
Kids!

409
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,300
Come in here, kids!

410
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:09,940
Whoa!

411
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,880
Hey, sorry.

412
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,040
Sorry, I got one of my children to be a backup dancer.

413
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,660
Sorry.

414
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,780
Give me a sec.

415
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
There we go.

416
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,900
Alright, kid.

417
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,920
Alright, kid.

418
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,840
We're gonna...

419
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,360
We need you to do a backup dancing.

420
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,940
Alright, there we go.

421
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,180
Sorry.

422
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,620
Sorry, now let's double.

423
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,360
That's the...

424
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,080
Alright, there we go.

425
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,980
Alright, take two.

426
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:32,720
Alright.

427
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,080
Alright, little dokey.

428
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,960
You're gonna work hard for your money tonight.

429
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,000
Alright.

430
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,320
Alright.

431
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,440
You wouldn't...

432
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,580
Come on, dude.

433
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,220
I brought a child with me, too.

434
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,350
Alright.

435
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,070
Alright, here we go.

436
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,950
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

437
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,990
But the very next day, you gave it away.

438
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:17,390
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

439
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:23,870
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

440
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:29,010
But the very next day, you gave it away.

441
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:38,230
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

442
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,070
Did my child do great?

443
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,050
Come on.

444
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,690
She's amazing.

445
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,730
She harmonized with me, sir.

446
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,870
I brought her out.

447
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,430
It's like negative 10 degrees.

448
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,070
I bring her out to do Christmas caroling for me.

449
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,330
We got a whole family to feed here.

450
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,890
Once bitten and twice shy.

451
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:12,050
I keep my distance as soon as you catch my eye.

452
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,470
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?

453
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,950
Well, it's been a year.

454
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,730
It doesn't surprise me.

455
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,910
Merry Christmas.

456
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,890
Last Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it.

457
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,150
With a note saying, I love you, I meant it.

458
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,710
Now I know what a fool I've been.

459
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:42,070
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again.

460
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,250
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

461
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,430
But the very next day, you gave it away.

462
00:27:52,830 --> 00:28:01,810
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

463
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,170
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

464
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,930
But the very next day, you gave it away.

465
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:22,790
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

466
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,930
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes.

467
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,310
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice.

468
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,990
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on.

469
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,230
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.

470
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,870
Face of a lover, with a fire in his heart.

471
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,250
A man undercover, but you tore me apart.

472
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,990
That's fucked up, bro.

473
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,730
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again.

474
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,790
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

475
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,910
But the very next day, you gave it away.

476
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:25,270
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

477
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,630
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

478
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:36,790
But the very next day, you gave it away.

479
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:46,090
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

480
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,290
Oh, that's a sad song.

481
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,450
That's a really sad song.

482
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,270
I made my child sing it.

483
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,130
I'm gonna put my whole heart into it.

484
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:03,170
Hey, little jokey, what do you have to say about that, little jokey, after a good song?

485
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,410
After a nice song that we sang together.

486
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,590
Oh my god, what is this?

487
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,690
You have your own tiny little tip jar?

488
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,690
Please, sir.

489
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,830
This will go towards my Christmas presents today.

490
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,810
Leave the child alone.

491
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,850
Wow, little jokey.

492
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,030
I'm following your old man's footsteps.

493
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,710
I'm so proud of you.

494
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,270
I'm so proud of you, little jokey.

495
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,470
Solid Snake, thank you for the super chat.

496
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,110
Thank you, thank you.

497
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,790
Isn't this extortion and bringing your child?

498
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,490
Look, you don't tell me how I parent my child.

499
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,730
Thank you for the super chat, Solid Snake.

500
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,190
Happy Christmas, dear keeper and child keeper.

501
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,210
You don't tell me how I parent my little jokey.

502
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,790
I'm the parent here.

503
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,230
And we're trying to bring some Christmas cheer.

504
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,650
Santino, thank you for the super chat.

505
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,010
Thank you, thank you.

506
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,830
For Dokia Jr. Max Sleepy, thank you for the super chat.

507
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,250
Thank you all.

508
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,030
Thank you for the tip.

509
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,690
Thank you for the tip for little jokey.

510
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,730
Thank you, thank you.

511
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,550
This is for the child only.

512
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,670
Thank you, thank you.

513
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,530
Thank you for the little tip.

514
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,630
Thank you, thank you.

515
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,830
Tips for little jokey.

516
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,890
Alright, little jokey.

517
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,070
It's time to go, little jokey.

518
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,150
Go back in the car with the other jokeys.

519
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,110
Okay.

520
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,090
Alright.

521
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,130
Alright.

522
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,090
Thank you.

523
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,870
Thank you, sir.

524
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,550
I hope you've been enjoying the Christmas carols.

525
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,190
It has been a lot of work.

526
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,830
Oh my god.

527
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,130
You wouldn't know how many houses I've been to tonight.

528
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,910
Surprisingly one, which is yours.

529
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,770
And honestly, I know there's a lot of houses.

530
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,810
But I saw your Lamborghini out in the backyard.

531
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:22,310
And I knew this was the perfect house to bring in some Christmas cheer.

532
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,670
Oh my god, sir.

533
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,970
Is that a new Rolex watch you have there?

534
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:33,590
Alright, so I also brought my dog.

535
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,650
So, give me a sec while I bring him over.

536
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,690
Give me a sec.

537
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:43,990
Don't worry.

538
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,410
I brought my dog too.

539
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,490
But like, he's into this.

540
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,810
Okay, so don't worry.

541
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,450
Give me a sec while I bring him over.

542
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:56,890
No.

543
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,890
Excuse me, what do you mean ain't no way?

544
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,350
Dogs want Christmas cheer too.

545
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,630
Like, what's wrong with that?

546
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,330
Sometimes my pet wants to spend Christmas with me as well.

547
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,410
What's wrong with that, sir?

548
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,470
Are you judging my fucking dog now?

549
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,250
Wow, on Christmas?

550
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,610
Oh my god, no wonder you needed more Christmas cheer.

551
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,430
Oh wait, sorry.

552
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,690
Sorry for the lack of immersion there.

553
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,410
Sorry.

554
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,430
Sorry, sorry.

555
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,250
You just forgot to take your meds, sir.

556
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,810
There's no bubbles or anything.

557
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,990
You just forgot to take your meds there.

558
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,570
No, there's nothing weird in the background.

559
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,650
You just forgot to take your meds, sir.

560
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,850
That's really it.

561
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,950
There's nothing weird going on in the background.

562
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,050
Do not worry.

563
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,970
Alright, sir.

564
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,050
I'm coming back.

565
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,050
I'm coming back.

566
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,670
I brought my dog here.

567
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:04,930
Don't worry.

568
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,170
Alright.

569
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,870
Here we go.

570
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,950
Wait, that's not my... that's not it.

571
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,450
This one.

572
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,090
Alright.

573
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,110
Wait, that's not it.

574
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:12,690
Where am I?

575
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,570
Alright, here we go.

576
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,450
Alright.

577
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,830
Ah, hey there.

578
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,450
I'm back.

579
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,950
I brought my dog too.

580
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,430
I think I was like...

581
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,250
Here, this was where I was sitting.

582
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,070
Alright, there you go.

583
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,010
Yeah.

584
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,550
Oh, see?

585
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,950
Me, Doki Amber Doge.

586
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,570
We call him Dad for short.

587
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:30,750
Alright.

588
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:36,710
I brought him here to also sing us some Christmas carols.

589
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,390
He's also a separate fee if you don't know.

590
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,870
So, yeah.

591
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:49,330
It's a double, you know, double the people, double the tip.

592
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,090
He also has his own little...

593
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,950
Oh, am I taller than usual?

594
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,110
My bad.

595
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:58,970
Am I?

596
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,890
I don't even remember where I was standing, to be fair.

597
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,330
Like, you know, I like costume changes and everything.

598
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,310
It's a lot of work.

599
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,290
But, don't worry.

600
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:15,790
Don't worry.

601
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,370
We also have a...

602
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:22,610
Doki Amber Doge also has a special song to sing for you.

603
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:23,550
Alright.

604
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,390
What the fuck is this?

605
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,510
Jordan Smith version?

606
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,410
There's a gym?

607
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:27,870
Oh, wait.

608
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,970
Oh, my gosh.

609
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:29,530
Alright.

610
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,010
Alright, here we go.

611
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,170
That's right.

612
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,890
He has a little antler.

613
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,510
You know, maybe...

614
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,790
Maybe because he has a little antler, I should, like...

615
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,810
Oh, my gosh.

616
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,810
Okay, give me a sec.

617
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,770
Because he has a little antler, I feel like...

618
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,590
Alright, give me a sec.

619
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,470
Give me a sec.

620
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:45,890
Sorry.

621
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,930
Give me a...

622
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,390
Give me, like, a little bit.

623
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,010
Whoa.

624
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,150
Whoa.

625
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:51,890
Sorry.

626
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,010
You just forgot to take your meds.

627
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:55,830
That's really it.

628
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,230
There's nothing weird going on.

629
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,030
You just forgot to take your meds.

630
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:03,650
Alright.

631
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,530
There we go.

632
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,030
Now, let me stand further away so you can see this costume.

633
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,110
So, you see the little costume he has on.

634
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,330
Alright, there we go.

635
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,170
Alright, I just stood a little further...

636
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,210
Sorry, I have to go back.

637
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,250
And then...

638
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,290
Because you have a lot of steps on your porch.

639
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:21,710
You know.

640
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,630
You literally live on the hill.

641
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,370
So, I don't know why.

642
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,750
I think...

643
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,050
I don't know.

644
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,950
It feels like you don't want people, like, caroling at your doorstep.

645
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,130
Because you live on a hill.

646
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,230
Excluded from the rest of the town.

647
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,810
Looking down at the rest of the town.

648
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,910
So, I have to go down.

649
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,050
I have to, like, go down a couple of steps.

650
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,930
And that's why I, like, you know, went down a little.

651
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,470
So, now I'm, like, further away.

652
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:49,050
So, you can see my Jokey Amber, like, dad's little costume over here.

653
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,270
Alright, here we go.

654
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,490
Alright.

655
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,310
Sorry.

656
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:53,790
Give me a sec.

657
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,530
Let me reset my boombox.

658
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,270
Alright, here we go.

659
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,030
How do I get past security?

660
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:05,590
Don't...

661
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,610
We don't mention that.

662
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,650
I have, like, several children.

663
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,470
You're a mean one.

664
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,030
Mr. Grinch.

665
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:16,930
But you're very rich.

666
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,770
You really are a heel.

667
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,290
You're as cuddly as a cactus.

668
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,930
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch.

669
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:35,010
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel.

670
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,670
Sir, don't worry.

671
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,610
I'm not talking about you.

672
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,550
Don't worry.

673
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,530
It's not a song about you, sir.

674
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,690
You're a monster.

675
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,610
Yeah, that's right.

676
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,650
That's you, Mr. Grinch.

677
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,790
I'm not talking about you, by the way.

678
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,570
Your heart's an empty hole.

679
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,050
Your brain is full of spiders.

680
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,930
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch.

681
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,290
I wouldn't touch you with a 39 and a half foot pole.

682
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,950
You're a foul one, Mr. Dragon.

683
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,010
You have termites in your smile.

684
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:21,930
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Dragon.

685
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:30,530
Given the choice between the two of you, I'd take the seasick crocodile.

686
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:33,930
Oh, sorry.

687
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,870
That was a slip of tongue.

688
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,430
I didn't mean you guys.

689
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,650
Sorry, sir.

690
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:42,650
That was a slip of tongue, sir.

691
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,190
I was just thinking about how much you're not all of that.

692
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,250
You're a rider, Mr. Grinch.

693
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:55,150
You're the king of sinful thoughts.

694
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:01,390
Your heart's a dead tomato splat with moldy purple spots, Dragon.

695
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:08,730
You're a three-decker sour-crying toastless sandwich with arsenic sauce.

696
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,110
Aw, man.

697
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,010
Did I say dragon once again?

698
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,090
Aw, I'm so sorry.

699
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,710
I'm so sorry.

700
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,830
It's just another slip of tongue.

701
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,770
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch.

702
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,070
With a nausea supernause.

703
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:32,430
You're a crooked jerky jockey and you drive a crooked horse, Mr. Grinch.

704
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:46,210
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of rush-bush imaginable mangled up and tangled up nuts.

705
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:00,610
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch.

706
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,530
You're a nasty waxy skunk.

707
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:12,290
Your port is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch.

708
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,610
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote...

709
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,730
Sink, sank, sunk.

710
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:37,610
Sorry, this is like the second time I've sang this song, and then I forgot what the lyrics were at the end, so...

711
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:44,890
So I was like, whoa, that's pretty fucked up.

712
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:52,690
Twice is a coincidence, three times a problem.

713
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,170
Sorry, sorry, did I slip up again?

714
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:01,470
And I'm just thinking about how much... I was just thinking about you guys so much that it just...

715
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,710
It just like, slipped my mind, it just self-inserted itself into the song.

716
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,190
It could've been any song, Dragoons, it really could've been.

717
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:18,050
It was just, unfortunately, it was that song that like, on my head, my head was just like, Dragoons, Dragoons!

718
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:21,230
And then like, you know, because of that, like...

719
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:27,370
It just, it just like, slipped my mind, and then you got into the song.

720
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,150
It's just, unfortunately, I did not mean that, sir.

721
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,890
I did not mean that, sir, of course.

722
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,510
DK, thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

723
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,430
You're hilarious, my favorite song so far.

724
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,350
Thank you for the superchat.

725
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,270
Aw, man, really, I mean, on Christmas, aw, don't cry, guys!

726
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,070
On Christmas?

727
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,250
Come on!

728
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:51,650
You got inserted into the song, Dragoons!

729
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,650
Is that what you want?

730
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,690
You got a shout-out!

731
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,290
Even dad sang along, he even shouted you out, guys!

732
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,970
Every song is my favorite, sir.

733
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,610
Come on, don't close the door!

734
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,890
Come on!

735
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,330
He even...

736
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,370
Don't close the door!

737
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,130
He even has his own little tip jar!

738
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,690
Are you really?

739
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,690
Look at that!

740
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,810
Look at that, it's his own little tip jar!

741
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,690
You're really gonna not let him have any doggy treats tonight?

742
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:25,570
Come on!

743
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:33,890
Um, the amount of extortion for this kill makes me wonder if the ring doorbell was worth it.

744
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,950
WDN, thank you for the superchat.

745
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,370
Thank you, thank you.

746
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,930
What did we get out of so many songs?

747
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,130
Alright, alright, let me put my...

748
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,410
Let me put my dog back in the trunk real quick.

749
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,190
Alright, don't close the door though!

750
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,570
Guys, don't close the door.

751
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,770
I'll be back, just watch.

752
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,890
Leave the door open so you can watch me put the dog back in the trunk.

753
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,170
Don't worry, I'll be back.

754
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,910
I'll be back, don't worry.

755
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,610
You guys want more immersion?

756
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,130
Don't worry guys, I'm gonna...

757
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,470
Okay, I'm gonna give you guys so much immersion.

758
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,230
Don't worry.

759
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,250
Don't worry.

760
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,510
I'm going down.

761
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,490
Alright, yeah.

762
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,530
Don't worry, I'll be back.

763
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,770
There's so many stairs.

764
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,930
Oh my god.

765
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,870
Oh my god, you live so far up, sir.

766
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:32,030
You live so far up.

767
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,810
Oh my god, alright.

768
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,910
Okay, alright.

769
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,890
Dad, you gotta...

770
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,550
Alright, give me a sec.

771
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,890
I'm gonna put him...

772
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,890
I'm putting him in the trunk right now.

773
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,290
Give me a sec.

774
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,010
Alright, got it.

775
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:47,790
Get to the car.

776
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,010
There's the car.

777
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,030
Alright, here we go.

778
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,550
Where's my keys?

779
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,650
Alright, there you go.

780
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,350
Alright, get in there.

781
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,230
That's right.

782
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,290
Yeah.

783
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,670
Alright, here, let me get you some stuff real quick.

784
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:05,470
Okay.

785
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,010
Bye, little dokey.

786
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:09,930
You wanted a drink?

787
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,070
Don't worry, I got you some drinks.

788
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,730
Stop opening the car door!

789
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,530
Everything's fine.

790
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,550
I'm coming back up now.

791
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,090
I'm coming back up.

792
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,910
I'm coming back up.

793
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:25,530
You have so many stairs.

794
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,090
Oh my god.

795
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,030
Oh my god.

796
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,190
So many goddamn stairs here.

797
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,210
I'm walking back up.

798
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,890
I'm walking back up.

799
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,070
I'm walking back up.

800
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,410
Don't worry, I'm getting there.

801
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,650
Alright, there you go.

802
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,490
Woah, sorry.

803
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,770
Your house moved a little bit.

804
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,270
That was freaky as hell.

805
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,870
But I'm coming back.

806
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:52,350
Hello.

807
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,170
I'm back.

808
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,990
I hope that was very immersive.

809
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,830
So you felt like...

810
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,070
You know, you were...

811
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,930
So it felt like, you know, you were actually there.

812
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,650
I hope that was very immersive for you.

813
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,530
As it was for me.

814
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:15,630
Because I definitely went down the staircase and everything.

815
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,170
So, yeah.

816
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,790
He's in the trunk now.

817
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,630
And I'm here to sing more Christmas carols.

818
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:35,590
I'm here for to give you some more holiday cheer.

819
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:42,210
Here to take this money and buy yourself a domestic inventive gift bag.

820
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,750
Honestly, you're only away from this kidnapper.

821
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,510
Thank you for...

822
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,690
Woah, sorry!

823
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,610
Thank you for the super chat.

824
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,090
Oh my god, sorry.

825
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:58,590
I had to read Sorry, I had to read this message on my phone.

826
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,470
So, it like...

827
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,090
If I'm going back and forth, it's cause like...

828
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,170
I had to look at something real quick.

829
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,730
But everything's okay now.

830
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,750
Everything should be okay.

831
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,030
Alright, here we go.

832
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,670
Next Christmas carol that I have for you.

833
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,290
Oh my god, give me a sec.

834
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,790
Sorry, I'm moving all over the place.

835
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,650
I'm just so happy to be here.

836
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:33,470
Sorry, I'm so happy to be here, so I'm moving all over the place right now.

837
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,890
Alright, yeah.

838
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:36,770
It's just very slippery.

839
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,850
Have you ever thought about salting your porch?

840
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,930
It's very slippery right here.

841
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:43,530
Alright.

842
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:47,130
This is a classic that...

843
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,110
I love to sing.

844
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,630
I'm trying to remember the song name.

845
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,210
I don't know...

846
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,490
I don't know if you know this, but like...

847
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:59,030
I'm doing all of this live.

848
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,270
I didn't really come in here with a set list.

849
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,870
I would just be like...

850
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,770
Oh man, this is what I feel like singing right now.

851
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,330
So like...

852
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,010
Give me a sec.

853
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,470
Okay, I need to pull out my phone.

854
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:15,910
Real quick.

855
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,730
To find this thing that I'm trying to find.

856
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:21,970
Yes!

857
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:24,350
I'm winging it!

858
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:30,870
Each house I visit gets a unique experience.

859
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:38,110
A unique experience tailored towards the specific house I'm singing to.

860
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,310
So you don't understand, sir.

861
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,590
Merry Christmas!

862
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,490
Don't keep it from a fellow YouTuber to another.

863
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:46,470
God bless you!

864
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,210
Thank you for your very first tip!

865
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:50,960
Thank you!

866
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,400
I really appreciate it.

867
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,920
See, this dragon gets it.

868
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,780
Look, look, look.

869
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,760
You are the first house I visited.

870
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,040
Each house I go to, I will improve.

871
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:05,740
Okay, sir?

872
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,620
So like...

873
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,240
Why are you... This is a free experience!

874
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,080
Well, not really.

875
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:11,480
But...

876
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:19,820
Um...

877
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,760
I mean...

878
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,940
This is a free experience!

879
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,740
Why are you complaining?

880
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,560
Okay, um...

881
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,180
Alright, here.

882
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,280
Um...

883
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:40,560
Okay.

884
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,320
What was the song called?

885
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,800
Oh my gosh, sorry.

886
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,280
I'm like, okay.

887
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,800
I figured it out.

888
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,040
I figured it out.

889
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,560
Alright, Spotify Boombox.

890
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,580
Grab me the song.

891
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:55,680
There you go.

892
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,120
Thank you, Spotify Boombox.

893
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:58,980
This is a classic.

894
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,020
Alright.

895
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,040
I'll stop the instruments.

896
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,520
It's okay.

897
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,760
I don't know if it's too loud or not.

898
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,920
I'm Mr. White Christmas.

899
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,640
I'm Mrs. Snow.

900
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,900
I'm Mrs. Icicle.

901
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,060
I'm Mrs. Ten Below.

902
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,900
Friends call me Snow Mizer.

903
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,140
Whatever I touch turns to snow in my clutch.

904
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,060
I'm too much.

905
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,900
That's right!

906
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,080
That's me!

907
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,220
Wow!

908
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,640
Friends call me Snow Mizer.

909
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,960
Whatever I touch turns to snow in my clutch.

910
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:51,380
Whoa!

911
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,740
Too much.

912
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,840
I never want to know a day that's over 40 degrees.

913
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,360
I'd rather have it 20, 30, and 5 and let it freeze!

914
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,260
He's Mr. White Christmas.

915
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,960
He's Mrs. Snow.

916
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,720
That's right!

917
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,380
I'm Mrs. Icicle.

918
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,480
I'm Mrs. Ten Below.

919
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,360
Friends call me Snow Mizer.

920
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,680
Whatever I touch turns to snow in my clutch.

921
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,840
Too much.

922
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,040
Too much.

923
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,000
Wow!

924
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,720
That's honestly one of my favorite songs, sir.

925
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:47,460
So, like, I hope you appreciate this experience because this is honestly one of my favorite Christmas songs in general.

926
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,180
So, like, I'm very happy that I was able to sing this for you again.

927
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:59,720
Honestly, this is actually my go- I don't know!

928
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,540
It's honestly one of my top 10 Christmas songs- Top 5!

929
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:09,720
Top 5 Christmas songs because it's such- I feel like it fits my personality a lot so I'm really happy to be able to sing that.

930
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,240
Alright!

931
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:12,840
Alright!

932
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,360
Anyway.

933
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,940
Whatever- Okay, what other Christmas songs do I know for you guys?

934
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,320
Give me a sec.

935
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,180
I'm thinking.

936
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,860
I'm just like, there's so many Christmas songs in the world.

937
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,680
Oh, wait!

938
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,180
I know.

939
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,760
I know exactly.

940
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,460
Alright.

941
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,460
Oh, yeah.

942
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,220
Alright, so I brought a little prop for this one.

943
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:50,420
I brought a little prop for us today for this particular song because I felt like, you know, the visuals for it would really work really well for it.

944
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,560
So, give me a sec.

945
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,240
Let me grab this prop.

946
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:53,860
Don't worry!

947
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,620
I already brought- I don't have to go downstairs to the trunk again to grab this particular prop.

948
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,840
So, do not worry.

949
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,080
Um...

950
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,280
Here it is.

951
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,520
I hope it's okay if I put it in your house, though.

952
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,700
I hope that's alright.

953
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,840
Alright, so...

954
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,480
There's- There he is.

955
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,060
Alright.

956
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,260
There's a two-minute version on my boombox?

957
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,100
Alright, let's do this.

958
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:23,470
Yeah!

959
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:25,710
No way.

960
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:26,990
Yeah!

961
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:42,630
Frosty the snowman was a jolly, happy soul with a corncob pipe and a button nose and his eyes made out of coal.

962
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:54,130
Frosty the snowman made the children laugh and play and were they surprised when before their eyes he came to life that day.

963
00:52:54,370 --> 00:53:06,150
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found for when they placed it on his head he began to dance around.

964
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:06,710
Oh!

965
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:17,950
Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be and the children say he could laugh and play the same as you and me.

966
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:30,030
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day so he said, let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away.

967
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:42,050
So down to the village with a broomstick in his hand running here and there all around the square saying, catch me if you can.

968
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:53,890
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic stop and he only paused a moment when they heard him holler, stop!

969
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:54,930
Oh!

970
00:53:55,010 --> 00:54:05,510
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way but he waved goodbye saying, don't you cry, I'll be back again someday.

971
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:11,230
Thumpity, thump, thump, thumpity, thump, thump, look at Frosty go.

972
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:17,150
Thumpity, thump, thump, thumpity, thump, thump, over the hills of snow.

973
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:18,650
Yay!

974
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,570
Woo!

975
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:25,790
He will be remembered.

976
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,490
He will be remembered.

977
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,770
Yay!

978
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:41,830
Magic hat and carrot and coal and then he'll come back to life Might not be the same guy again, but like, you know, I might have some trauma in those eyes, but he'll be back Just wait next year My house

Are you going to really hurt him like that?

1078
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:07,950

01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:15,110

so I'm a sexer, right?

1210
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:55,940
This is the second best idea that we've ever had The choice can be no other, be my mother lover Happy, Merry Christmas everybody LOL

1211
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:17,510
So I told you guys, I had a...

1212
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:24,330
I had a really really big lonely island phase

1213
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:47,790
So yeah, it was a phase that I had, but don't worry, don't worry guys, don't worry because

1214
01:20:50,990 --> 01:21:15,730

1217

01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:27,630
oh man, you've been a naughty boy, oh my god, woah, you're best friends too, damn, gotta do it for your homies, right?

1221
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:49,990
I see you when you're sleeping, and he knows when you're awake, he knows if you've been bad or good, so be good, for goodness sake, yeah, hide your moms!

1222
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,550
You better watch out.

1223
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,390
You better not cry.

1224
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:56,050
You better not pout.

1225
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:58,050
I'm telling you why.

1226
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:03,050
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1227
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:07,410
You better watch out.

1228
01:24:07,770 --> 01:24:09,530
You better not cry.

1229
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:11,530
You better not pout.

1230
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:13,450
I'm telling you why.

1231
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:16,830
Santa Claus is coming.

1232
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:21,490
I mean the big fat man with the long white beard.

1233
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:25,590
He's coming to town.

1234
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:29,050
Whoa.

1235
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:32,530
Oh lord, he's coming.

1236
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,390
Thanks, Doki.

1237
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,470
That's what the lyrics were!

1238
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:39,790
I was reading the lyrics!

1239
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:45,950
Isn't that great?

1240
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:47,450
Isn't that great, Jaegun?

1241
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,130
You got the...

1242
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:56,370
Like, right after Mother Lover, we have something like really wholesome to sing right after.

1243
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:59,770
Santa knows what art you watch on Twitter.

1244
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:02,250
Mr. Tooth, thank you for the super chat.

1245
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,310
Thank you, thank you.

1246
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:04,730
Oh lord, he's coming.

1247
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:09,930
He knows.

1248
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,310
He knows what you've been doing.

1249
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:12,010
Whoa.

1250
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:15,010
Wait, I wonder...

1251
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,170
Oh, I don't think they have that.

1252
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:17,790
I was gonna say.

1253
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:22,210
Alright, let me see if they have this song.

1254
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:27,070
Oh my god, I'd be so happy if they do.

1255
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,250
Oh, they don't.

1256
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:28,870
Never mind.

1257
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:30,650
Okay, I'll do this song.

1258
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:34,610
This is a really sad song, guys.

1259
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:36,370
I just need you to know that.

1260
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:37,870
This is a really sad song.

1261
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:43,070
It's very sad.

1262
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,190
And we'll have the lead singing on the background too.

1263
01:25:48,710 --> 01:26:22,170
I thought I had everybody on my side But when I went and blew it all sky high And now she won't even spare a passing glance All just because I ripped my pants Big Larry came around just to put him down Spongebob turned into a clown But no girl ever wants to dance With a fool who went and ripped his pants I know I shouldn't mope around,

1264
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:35,850
I shouldn't kiss But the pain feels so much worse Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun Than a burn from the sun or sands in your buns

1265
01:26:39,210 --> 01:27:14,330
Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget So listen and you won't regret Be true to yourself, don't miss your chance And you won't end up like the fool Who ripped his pants So true, oh so sad Don't be like him Don't be like him Alright,

1266
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:46,310
that went to autoplay So true, so true Lessons I learned Don't be like him who ripped his pants So sad, so very sad Okay, what if like, oh my god That would be so fucked up if I do this song Okay guys, oh my god Guys, sorry, I'm gonna Did I lose viewers for the songs I've been singing?

1267
01:27:46,730 --> 01:28:06,670
Oh my god, my viewership went up Okay, okay, guys Alright, so this next song This next song that I would like to sing It would absolutely I would not be surprised If like, people left after this song Because it is

1268
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:16,990
I would not, I would not be surprised If people, if people leave Okay

1269
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:35,730
This is like I don't know if I can sing this But like, I don't know I've never sang this song before But I've listened to it But this is one of the songs that Mint rejected for the concert

1270
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:46,850
So I'm gonna sing it for my Christmas carols

1271
01:28:52,130 --> 01:29:26,410
Seven years Fuck you Things have changed a lot since he left town I gotta send a message of who's really in charge of things now Welcome home I'm gonna make you wish that you'd stay gone Say hello to a new status quo Everyone knows that there's a brand new dawn Turn the TV on...

1272
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:30,490
Camera speeds... rolling in 3, 2...

1273
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:33,250
I'm gonna mess this up.

1274
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:53,970
It's barely audible.

1275
01:29:54,290 --> 01:29:55,410
Stop giving that time of day.

1276
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:56,810
Don't listen to a word he's saying.

1277
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:59,450
I hope he had a very nice vacay, but he sure stayed away.

1278
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:04,370
While he hid in radio, we pivot to video.

1279
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:08,630
Now his medium is getting bloody rare.

1280
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:11,710
Hell's been better since he split.

1281
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:12,930
Where's he been?

1282
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,150
Who gives a shit?

1283
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,350
Yes, I know.

1284
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:22,470
It's been a while since someone with style treated hell to a broadcast.

1285
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:27,910
Singers rejoice instead of a cloud-chasing mediocre video podcast.

1286
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:30,930
This is so fast.

1287
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:34,090
I can't.

1288
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:34,890
Now I got lost.

1289
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:42,330
Is Vox as strong as he proposed or is it based on his support?

1290
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:46,470
He'd be powerless without the other Vs.

1291
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:49,390
And here's the sugar on the cream.

1292
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:51,630
He asked me to join his team.

1293
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:54,250
I said no and now he's pissy.

1294
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:55,350
That's the tea.

1295
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:58,510
I'll show you suffering.

1296
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:00,610
I have to do two rolls.

1297
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:02,110
I'll destroy you!

1298
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:06,850
Alright, now we go here.

1299
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:11,280
How did this get rejected?

1300
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:12,160
You know why.

1301
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,280
Let's begin.

1302
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:22,620
I'm gonna make you wish that I'd stayed gone.

1303
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:25,320
Tune on in.

1304
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,780
Your status quo will know it's race is run.

1305
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:37,760
All this will be fun.

1306
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,220
And

1307
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:49,570
you know why.

1308
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:55,750
You know why it got rejected.

1309
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:58,430
You know exactly why.

1310
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:04,270
I was not allowed to sing that song.

1311
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:09,050
It was sadly not a song that I was allowed to sing.

1312
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:17,730
No, no because I already shitposted too much.

1313
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:22,550
Thank you, thank you.

1314
01:32:24,230 --> 01:32:31,010
I already shitposted way too much so I wasn't allowed to include that in my setlist.

1315
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:39,610
Anyway, no because it requires two people.

1316
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:42,650
That is like a duet.

1317
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:46,830
It's a duet so it requires two people to sing that song.

1318
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:51,030
And the second person did not want to sing that song.

1319
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:58,510
So it got rejected.

1320
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:21,630
I feel generous right now and I'm willing to take your song request right now.

1321
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:30,390
Okay.

1322
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:00,290
We'll sing that later.

1323
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:05,210
I like how people were like, this chord is not on KeraFun.

1324
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:08,490
It's not on KeraFun guys.

1325
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:10,910
So is meow meow.

1326
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:14,110
I actually, there's no karaoke version.

1327
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:15,150
I don't know if there is.

1328
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:31,370
Jack Sparrow.

1329
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:32,230
Who's going to be my Michael?

1330
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:34,210
Okay, we'll do Jack Sparrow.

1331
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:36,230
We're just going to be on my Loading the Island era.

1332
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:49,410
We're going to be on my Michael Bolton era.

1333
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:54,730
Alright.

1334
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:57,670
Here we go.

1335
01:35:00,130 --> 01:35:01,450
Alright, let's lay it down.

1336
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:03,270
It's...

1337
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:06,030
Let me stop right for this.

1338
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:08,350
Here we go.

1339
01:35:39,450 --> 01:35:39,890
Yeah.

1340
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:44,990
What?

1341
01:35:57,450 --> 01:35:59,750
Yeah, that's kind of weird, but we're back in the club.

1342
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:02,290
Buying out the bar so the groupie show is love.

1343
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:04,750
Motherfucking Iceman, I'm the top gunna.

1344
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:07,190
Heater on blast, I'm the number one stunna.

1345
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:09,210
Watch it girls, cause I ain't your Mr. No.

1346
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:12,230
More like the meet ya, take ya home and fuck ya twice guy.

1347
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,330
All dressed up with nowhere to run.

1348
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:17,110
I know I make you feel crazy when I was born.

1349
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:21,790
No.

1350
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:34,650
Yeah, Jack Sparrow.

1351
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:39,110
Put your hands in the air and say hell yeah.

1352
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:39,670
Come on.

1353
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:40,610
What?

1354
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:41,830
No.

1355
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:44,030
From to the back saying we count stats.

1356
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:44,590
Come on.

1357
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:45,730
Nope.

1358
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:49,170
My father, we're really gonna need you to focus up.

1359
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:51,850
Wait.

1360
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:56,670
Not better.

1361
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:01,850
Come on.

1362
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:06,550
Oh God.

1363
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:11,820
Close enough.

1364
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,680
Tony Montana!

1365
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,040
This whole town's a pussy.

1366
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:35,780
Just waiting to get fucked.

1367
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:38,380
Alright.

1368
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:42,640
Turns out Michael Bolton is a major cinephile.

1369
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,400
Alright, I'm done with my...

1370
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,620
Sorry, I'm finished with my Lonely Island era.

1371
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,660
I'm done with... I swear it's over now.

1372
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,600
Now we go back to the... Sorry, sir.

1373
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,860
I'm done with my Lonely Island era, sir.

1374
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,180
I hope you've been liking this freestyle.

1375
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:07,160
That is wholeheartedly tailored towards you.

1376
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,180
Thank you so much for opening this door for me.

1377
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,680
So I can sing you all my favorite songs.

1378
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,060
And, you know, my Christmas carols, sir.

1379
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:20,080
Thank you for not closing the door on me when I knocked on your door.

1380
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,200
You have a lovely home, sir.

1381
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:22,760
You...

1382
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,840
You have a very lovely home.

1383
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,540
And I'm really...

1384
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:36,080
I'm really happy to be able to sing some Christmas carols for you.

1385
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,600
Oh, man.

1386
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,360
Oh, man.

1387
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,160
Alright, alright.

1388
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:42,820
Let me see.

1389
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,440
You know, I can take another...

1390
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,940
I can take another song request, sir.

1391
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,760
What would you like me to sing?

1392
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,000
On this special night.

1393
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,420
On Christmas.

1394
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,920
You know, it's Christmas.

1395
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,400
You sang well.

1396
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,420
Thank you, sir.

1397
01:38:58,700 --> 01:38:59,760
Busking is really hard.

1398
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:03,120
Christmas is the best time to busk as a singer.

1399
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:04,260
John, thank you.

1400
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,160
Thank you for the tip.

1401
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:05,480
Thank you.

1402
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:05,880
Thank you.

1403
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:06,420
Don't stop.

1404
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:08,180
Please do it like a boss.

1405
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,120
Okay, guys.

1406
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:10,340
No.

1407
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:11,600
Guys, we can't...

1408
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,480
We can't keep doing...

1409
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,580
Lonely Island songs, guys.

1410
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:20,020
We gotta move on.

1411
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,340
Oh, wait.

1412
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,720
Let's do the original.

1413
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:25,960
Wow.

1414
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,960
We'll do the original hot to go.

1415
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,660
Let me get my child over here.

1416
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:33,380
Alright, child.

1417
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,100
It's time to sing with me again.

1418
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:35,880
Yeah!

1419
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:47,580
Wait a minute.

1420
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,600
There should be more children.

1421
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,700
Let's get the mini...

1422
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:56,020
Oh, wait.

1423
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:56,560
Let's not.

1424
01:39:59,060 --> 01:39:59,820
More children!

1425
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:05,860
I said, young men, there's no need to feel down.

1426
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,600
I said, young men, pick yourself off the ground.

1427
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:17,360
I said, young men, if you're in a new town, there's no need to be unhappy.

1428
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,820
Young men, there's a place you can go.

1429
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:26,080
I said, young men, when you're short on your dope, you can stay there.

1430
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:32,840
And I'm sure you will find many ways to have a good time.

1431
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:38,480
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1432
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:42,300
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1433
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:43,520
Wow!

1434
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:47,260
They have everything for young men to enjoy.

1435
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,520
You can hang out with all the boys.

1436
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,020
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1437
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:57,360
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1438
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,460
You can get yourself clean.

1439
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:02,300
You can have a good meal.

1440
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:05,740
You can do whatever you feel.

1441
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:06,220
Whoa!

1442
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:10,040
Young men, are you listening to me?

1443
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:13,660
I said, young men, what do you wanna be?

1444
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:21,920
I said, young men, you can make clear your dreams, but you've got to know this one thing.

1445
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,100
No man does it all by himself.

1446
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:32,460
I said, young men, put your pride on the shelf and just go there to the YMCA.

1447
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:37,020
I'm sure they can help you today.

1448
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:39,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1449
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:42,760
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1450
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,560
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1451
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:51,540
They have everything for young men to enjoy.

1452
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:57,800
You can hang out with all the boys at YMCA.

1453
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,640
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1454
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,800
You can get yourself clean.

1455
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,640
You can have a good meal.

1456
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:09,960
You can do whatever you feel.

1457
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:14,280
Young men, I was once in your shoes.

1458
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:18,140
I said, I was down and out with the blues.

1459
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,940
I felt no man cared if I were alive.

1460
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:26,300
I felt the whole world was so jive.

1461
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:33,220
That's when someone came up to me and said, young men, take a walk up the street.

1462
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:36,680
There's a place there called the YMCA.

1463
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:41,340
They can start you back on your way.

1464
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1465
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:46,920
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1466
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:50,880
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1467
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:55,820
They have everything for young men to enjoy.

1468
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:59,100
You can hang out with all the boys.

1469
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,020
YMCA, yeah!

1470
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:06,020
YMCA.

1471
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:11,200
Young men, there's no need to feel down.

1472
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:12,980
Oh, wait, how does that go?

1473
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,940
I beat myself off the ground.

1474
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:17,700
Oh my god, they sang this part.

1475
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,360
And I was like, how the fuck does this go?

1476
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:20,960
It's like, young man, young man.

1477
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:21,780
I'm like, what?

1478
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:25,340
Anyway, my little jokey choir.

1479
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:27,000
Carollers right here.

1480
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,800
I fumbled the last part.

1481
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:36,240
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

1482
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,900
Young, young, what is this?

1483
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:41,280
How does this go?

1484
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:44,980
Young man, young man, what do you wanna be?

1485
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,480
YMCA.

1486
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,340
You'll find it at the YMCA.

1487
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,640
No man, no man.

1488
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,320
Does it all by himself.

1489
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:00,140
Young man, young man, put your pride on the show.

1490
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:02,860
I had to listen to him.

1491
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,380
This just goes to the YMCA.

1492
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,900
I had to look at how he sang that part.

1493
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,660
I've never heard the ending of YMCA before.

1494
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:21,500
Young man, young man, we all just know YMCA.

1495
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:29,300
Sorry, I didn't know what the ending of YMCA sounded like until now.

1496
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:34,780
That was the first time I've ever heard the ending of YMCA.

1497
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:40,300
All right, that's gonna appear real quick because I need to right click real fast.

1498
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:40,920
I should have.

1499
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:41,720
All right, here we go.

1500
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:49,400
This is my little band of children carollers.

1501
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,500
Wait, whoops, not that.

1502
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:53,600
Whoops, not that.

1503
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:53,920
Sorry.

1504
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,800
This, there we go.

1505
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,320
I moved the wrong thing.

1506
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:58,940
All right, there we go.

1507
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:03,540
My other band of carollers right here.

1508
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:04,760
All right, there we go.

1509
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:07,080
There we go.

1510
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:07,830
My little...

1511
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:14,380
Sorry, I did control Z, so you saw so many things popped up from that.

1512
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:19,220
Let me make sure they all are resized as much as I'd like.

1513
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:23,200
All right, boop, there we go.

1514
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,700
All right, look at that.

1515
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,580
My little band of carollers.

1516
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:30,840
My children, that I need to feed.

1517
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,880
Yeah, my kids.

1518
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,150
All right, there you go.

1519
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:42,270
I didn't want to be too close.

1520
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:45,470
I felt like that was a little awkward being like way too close to you guys.

1521
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:52,010
All right.

1522
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:54,510
What other song?

1523
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:56,210
What other song should we do?

1524
01:45:56,990 --> 01:46:00,090
What other songs would you guys like?

1525
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:01,670
Oh wait, there was one.

1526
01:46:01,710 --> 01:46:03,130
I was thinking one song that I really want.

1527
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,130
Oh wait, all right, guys.

1528
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:06,670
I'll do a favorite of mine.

1529
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:08,670
I'm not very good at this, but like...

1530
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:09,410
Oh my gosh, sorry.

1531
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:10,430
Sorry, wrong child.

1532
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,150
All right, children, move.

1533
01:46:13,650 --> 01:46:14,930
Daddy's gonna sing now.

1534
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:18,270
Daddy's gonna do some songs that she wants to sing.

1535
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:20,730
All right.

1536
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:24,010
We'll do this and then Feliz Navidad.

1537
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:26,090
And then I'm gonna come into your house.

1538
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:27,710
You're gonna invite me into your house.

1539
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:28,630
All right, after that.

1540
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:30,050
Yeah!

1541
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,270
It's one of my favorites.

1542
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:36,010
It's not Christmas, but I like singing this song.

1543
01:46:55,810 --> 01:47:01,570
Extravagant, the moon on the Seine, the Seine, the Seine.

1544
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:10,190
Everything is not easy, lost on the Seine, the Seine, the Seine.

1545
01:47:10,730 --> 01:47:14,550
I don't know, don't know, don't know why.

1546
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:18,050
Together like this, the Seine and me.

1547
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:23,090
I don't know, don't know, don't know why.

1548
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:26,770
Together like this, the Seine and me.

1549
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:29,710
I love this song.

1550
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:37,730
Mr. Lucille, when you are on the Seine, the Seine, the Seine.

1551
01:47:40,330 --> 01:47:46,350
Extravagant, when we are on the Seine, the Seine, the Seine.

1552
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:50,650
I don't know, don't know, don't know why.

1553
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:54,230
Together like this, the Seine and me.

1554
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:59,050
I don't know, don't know, don't know why.

1555
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:02,870
Together like this, the Seine and me.

1556
01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:13,050
It's the bridge of the Seine, my little Lucille, in the middle of the Seine.

1557
01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:16,730
It's so beautiful, it's so beautiful.

1558
01:48:17,270 --> 01:48:22,810
I breathe it, the waves are pushing on this bridge.

1559
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:32,770
Together like this, the Seine and me.

1560
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:41,170
Together like this, the Seine and me.

1561
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:49,810
Together like this, the Seine and me.

1562
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:58,250
Together like this, the Seine and me.

1563
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:09,840
That's one of my favorite songs.

1564
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,220
I really wanted to sing it because it was my favorite song.

1565
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:14,640
I hope you let me, I'm glad you let me.

1566
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:18,700
I can't believe you stood here for two hours listening to this caroler sing.

1567
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:21,420
Like, don't you have a Christmas party to go to?

1568
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:23,000
But it's alright, you know?

1569
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,320
I'm technically free entertainment.

1570
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:29,220
So like, maybe your Christmas party was just not it.

1571
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,080
But don't worry, that's why I'm here.

1572
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:33,840
Oh my god, sorry, sorry.

1573
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:36,440
And I also left you Frosty the Snowman here too.

1574
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:40,440
So like, everything is great.

1575
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:52,120
But I hope you've been having a good time listening to this good old caroler sing for you.

1576
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:56,070
Trying to make ends meet here down here in the...

1577
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,720
I'm trying to make ends meet, you know?

1578
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:06,620
For her family and her dog.

1579
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:13,220
Merry Christmas!

1580
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:14,060
Merry Christmas!

1581
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:14,700
You know what?

1582
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:17,800
I'll give you one last Christmas song.

1583
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:21,940
Before you invite me in.

1584
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:24,340
Invite me into your home.

1585
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,300
Alright.

1586
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:31,800
Alright, as promised.

1587
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:32,740
Yeah!

1588
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,000
But...

1589
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,820
I already missed the entrance.

1590
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,960
That's when you know it's live.

1591
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,720
Wait, this is the Spanish version.

1592
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,120
There should be an English version.

1593
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:11,080
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1594
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:14,380
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1595
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:20,860
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

1596
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,140
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1597
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:27,380
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1598
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,420
I don't know how to sing in Spanish.

1599
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:34,380
Merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

1600
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:35,340
How do you pronounce it?

1601
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,220
Feliz Navidad.

1602
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,500
Feliz Navidad.

1603
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:45,680
Feliz Navidad, prospero, something, felicidad.

1604
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:46,840
Apparently I'm not supposed to say that.

1605
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:47,120
No.

1606
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,160
Feliz Navidad.

1607
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,820
Feliz Navidad, año.

1608
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:53,440
Okay.

1609
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:58,620
Feliz Navidad, prospero, año, y felicidad.

1610
01:51:58,900 --> 01:51:59,720
I did it!

1611
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,720
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1612
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:03,820
Spanish 101 here.

1613
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,160
But I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1614
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:11,650
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

1615
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,120
I'm learning today.

1616
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:15,900
Wish you a merry Christmas.

1617
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:16,560
Yeah!

1618
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,140
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1619
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:24,670
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

1620
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,840
Feliz Navidad.

1621
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:28,740
Whoa!

1622
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:31,160
Feliz Navidad.

1623
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:32,100
Yeah!

1624
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:37,360
Feliz Navidad, prospero, año, y felicidad.

1625
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:40,780
Feliz Navidad.

1626
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:41,660
Whoa!

1627
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:42,300
Merry Christmas!

1628
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,040
Feliz Navidad.

1629
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:44,980
Yippee!

1630
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:45,540
Yeah!

1631
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:50,040
Feliz Navidad, prospero, año, y felicidad.

1632
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:51,840
I'm doing it!

1633
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:54,460
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1634
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,140
Yeah!

1635
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:57,660
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1636
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:58,360
Whoo!

1637
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,880
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1638
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,140
From the bottom of my heart.

1639
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:07,300
I wanna wish you a merry Christmas.

1640
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:07,880
Whoo!

I wanna wish you a merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

1643
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,260
Feliz Navidad.

1644
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,440
Yippee!

1645
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:22,520
Feliz Navidad.

1646
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:23,220
Whoa!

1647
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:28,560
Feliz Navidad, prospero, año, y felicidad.

1648
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:31,680
Yeah!

1649
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:33,220
You know what?

1650
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,740
I feel very, like, festive.

1651
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:37,360
I'll do, like, two more songs.

1652
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,540
I feel incredibly festive right now.

1653
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:45,300
The more I sing, the more festive I'm starting.

1654
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:47,000
I'm starting to feel it, guys.

1655
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:50,060
I'm just starting to feel the festivities here.

1656
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,880
So I'm gonna do...

1657
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,860
I can do, like, two more songs.

1658
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:55,800
I have two more songs in me.

1659
01:53:56,380 --> 01:53:57,180
It's hitting.

1660
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:58,920
Yeah, it's hitting right now.

1661
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:01,220
All right.

1662
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,280
I'm on a festive streak.

1663
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:05,020
Exactly.

1664
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,320
Wait, let me see.

1665
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:08,620
Wait, maybe I could do...

1666
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:13,040
I'm trying to think of, like...

1667
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:15,620
I'm in the zone.

1668
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:19,720
Yeah, but now I gotta think of a song quick or I'll get out of the zone.

1669
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:27,680
I gotta quickly find another song or this zone is gonna be gone.

1670
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,380
Feeling the vibes right now.

1671
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:33,440
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

1672
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,460
I'm fucking feeling it right now.

1673
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:39,600
Okay, let me see.

1674
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:42,380
Let's see.

1675
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:47,320
I'm trying to see what are some good songs.

1676
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,160
Where are some good songs?

1677
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:52,160
Something Christmas-y, guys.

1678
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:53,940
Something Christmas-y.

1679
01:54:54,080 --> 01:55:00,180
I need more Christmas songs that I can just pull up.

1680
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:04,770
All right, let's see.

1681
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:15,930
Deck the halls with boughs of holly, Fa la la la, la la la la.

1682
01:55:15,970 --> 01:55:16,970
Wait, is there, like...

1683
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:17,770
Wait a minute.

1684
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:21,390
Is there...

1685
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:24,270
Wait, what's that song called?

1686
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:30,930
Okay, I wanna know if they actually have this song.

1687
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:37,170
There's this song, I'm, like, wondering if they actually have it.

1688
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,360
Let's see.

1689
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,520
I'm trying to see if they have it.

1690
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:45,400
Guys, I'm sorry.

1691
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:46,180
This is...

1692
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:47,340
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1693
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:48,560
I'm looking through my...

1694
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:49,220
I'm looking through my...

1695
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:52,350
I'm looking through my Spotify boombox right now.

1696
01:55:58,070 --> 01:55:59,610
Wait, this is actually...

1697
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:02,250
Wait, I'm wondering if this is right.

1698
01:56:05,210 --> 01:56:05,810
All right.

1699
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:10,770
I don't know if I can actually sing this, but we can listen to it.

1700
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:12,790
We can listen to this.

1701
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:32,790
Right, let's go.

1702
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:35,250
My my my my...

1703
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:37,890
Mamon nana na na na na.

1704
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:12,550
Banana!

1705
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:14,810
Banana!

1706
01:57:21,310 --> 01:57:29,330
Na na na na na na na na nana bada bada bada.

1707
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:33,750
Banana.

1708
01:57:36,050 --> 01:57:36,790
Banana.

1709
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:39,010
Banana!

1710
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:43,710
I'm so locked in.

1711
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:08,330
I'm so locked in.

1712
01:58:10,130 --> 01:58:13,050
This is Lucy from the Muppets.

1713
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:16,490
I'm speaking the word of God.

1714
01:58:17,470 --> 01:58:18,870
You are...

1715
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:20,930
This is the sentence.

1716
01:58:21,650 --> 01:58:22,260
It's called...

1717
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:24,790
Muna Muna from the Muppets.

1718
01:58:24,930 --> 01:58:27,650
Oh my God, you don't know this song?

1719
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:30,230
Oh my God, Zoomers don't know.

1720
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:31,410
You guys don't know.

1721
01:58:31,670 --> 01:58:33,790
Fucking peak there.

1722
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:35,510
It's actual peak.

1723
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:42,930
It's actual peak from the Muppets.

1724
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:44,010
It's a classic.

1725
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:04,150
It's actually a peak song right there.

1726
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:07,370

Thanks for all that you've done this year from the charity stream and the Phantom Thief concert.

1732
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:24,710

I like how I used up my one song to be like...

1738
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:48,750
I like how one guy actually joined my membership after that.

1739
01:59:48,870 --> 01:59:51,630
They're like, oh my God, I get her now.

02:02:24,850 --> 02:02:26,310
Don't close the door.

1774
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:28,350

Oh my god.

1877
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:15,690
Okay, I actually, this is like the third time I've ever listened to this song, by the way.

1878
02:08:16,110 --> 02:08:19,290
I didn't have PokéRap.

1879
02:08:19,650 --> 02:08:25,130
I think I stopped, I didn't ever see the opening of the PokéRap when I was growing up.

1880
02:08:25,170 --> 02:08:26,910
I only saw the original intro.

1881
02:08:27,470 --> 02:08:32,070
So I was just like, so the only time I've ever seen PokéRap was on YouTube.

1882
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:36,450
And I was just like, and I don't know some of the actual names.

1883
02:08:37,430 --> 02:08:40,010
Like, I didn't have to pronounce the actual names.

1884
02:08:40,370 --> 02:08:47,190
So like, pronouncing some of the Pokémon, I'm actually pronouncing those names out loud for the very first time.

1885
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:54,470
So I was just like, oh that's a, oh my god, I pronounced that person's name.

1886
02:08:54,890 --> 02:08:56,390
Oh, okay, okay.

1887
02:08:56,410 --> 02:08:57,210
I'll do one more.

1888
02:08:59,870 --> 02:09:00,410
Alright.

1889
02:09:02,150 --> 02:09:02,990
For real.

1890
02:09:02,990 --> 02:09:03,070
Oh.

1891
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:05,530
Alright.

1892
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:16,390
Everyone always says, Princess Peach, won't you listen to my speech?

1893
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:20,750
I don't have any stars of invincibility.

1894
02:09:21,450 --> 02:09:25,870
But you're the brightest star in the sky tonight for me.

1895
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:29,110
I'm your Luigi.

1896
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:32,450
What up, bitch?

1897
02:09:32,530 --> 02:09:33,750
I got a one-up, bitch.

1898
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:35,310
What's inside the question box?

1899
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:36,330
It's my dick.

1900
02:09:36,510 --> 02:09:39,090
It's a me, a Mario, my Italian, and pastrami.

1901
02:09:39,170 --> 02:09:41,530
I'll take you by the peaches and give you the hot salami.

1902
02:09:41,630 --> 02:09:43,970
I save you from dragons and evil booze that are spooky.

1903
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:46,430
Must I be a raccoon to get inside you, Tanooki?

1904
02:09:46,610 --> 02:09:49,050
I'll mount you like Yoshi and show you things you've never seen.

1905
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:51,290
My mushroom's not mega, if you know what I mean.

1906
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:52,450
So suck it, Mario.

1907
02:09:52,770 --> 02:10:01,030
You always do this shit on Like A Girl and then you ruin it by yelling stuff about your dick until they go away.

1908
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:03,670
Okay, someone else be Peach.

1909
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:07,190
I don't wanna be Peach.

1910
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:14,140
You really mean that, Peach?

1911
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:15,800
Oh, princess.

1912
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:19,300
It means so much for me to hear you say that.

1913
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:23,780
The only thing I've ever wanted to tell you is that I'm here to pleasure the ass.

1914
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:26,440
I like to go first, princess, but I always come last.

1915
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:28,920
And you say we'll get together, but I'm jacking off alone.

1916
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:31,420
Koopa Troopa skeletons aren't the only dry bones.

1917
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:33,940
I'm tired of your running around such a fucking hassle.

1918
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,540
I go through shit and then you're in another fucking castle.

1919
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,960
You gotta think about it while I don't believe the hype.

1920
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:41,880
You'll have a lot of time to think when you're smoking on my warp pipe.

1921
02:10:42,340 --> 02:10:42,820
Ahahaha!

1922
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:44,680
Hahaha!

1923
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:47,620
Yeah!

1924
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:54,200
I'm ready to give love a shot.

1925
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:56,540
It's not about how many coins you've got.

1926
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:59,240
I just know I like you a lot.

1927
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:01,040
Yo, slut, check out my yacht!

1928
02:11:01,980 --> 02:11:04,320
Let me take you on a magic car ride.

1929
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:06,820
I'll bust all your balloons when I smack your backside.

1930
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:08,020
We'll have some fun.

1931
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:09,160
I'll bring my friends along.

1932
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:11,780
I'll kick that donkey car right in the conky dong.

1933
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:13,000
Come on, peach.

1934
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:14,200
It's time to make your choice.

1935
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:16,740
I'm the only plumber that can make your boobies rejoice.

1936
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,280
Green lanky-ass brethren got shit on me.

1937
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:22,080
It's time to live out our story of the princess and the penis.

1938
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:23,040
Hahaha!

1939
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:24,200
So...

1940
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:27,400
I choose...

1941
02:11:27,820 --> 02:11:28,280
Toad.

1942
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:31,700
His whole body's shaped like a dick.

1943
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:34,000
Alright, sorry.

1944
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,820
I saw somebody said, do Starbomb.

1945
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:40,140
And then, I was like, okay.

1946
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:47,820
Just after Pokemon is final!

1947
02:11:48,420 --> 02:11:50,060
Oh my god!

1948
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:53,240
I've never sang this song before.

1949
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:54,600
I've just listened to it.

1950
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:59,660
I've literally just I've literally only just listened to this song.

1951
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:01,640
I've never sang it before.

1952
02:12:01,940 --> 02:12:04,440
So I was like, I don't know if I can do the rap part.

1953
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:12,380
But like, everyone says I'm like Aaron Hansen by being bad at video games and just complaining and blaming the game itself instead of reading the instructions.

1954
02:12:12,940 --> 02:12:14,620
So I thought like, okay man.

1955
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:20,190
I was just like, you know what?

1956
02:12:20,250 --> 02:12:25,710
I just channeled in my Aaron Hansen to... I channeled it in.

1957
02:12:26,130 --> 02:12:27,350
Is that Egoraptor?

1958
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:28,610
Oh my god.

1959
02:12:28,930 --> 02:12:29,950
That Egoraptor?

1960
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:35,310
Next scene.

1961
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:36,310
Thank you for the super chat.

1962
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:36,970
Thank you, thank you.

1963
02:12:37,090 --> 02:12:39,070
Oh my god.

1964
02:12:42,450 --> 02:12:43,810
Alright, okay.

1965
02:12:44,890 --> 02:12:46,010
Alright, okay.

1966
02:12:46,110 --> 02:12:46,410
Sorry.

1967
02:12:46,910 --> 02:12:50,070
This karaoke, this Christmas... I'm sorry, sir.

1968
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:55,330
I'm sorry if your kids are watching and you heard me talking about my penis.

1969
02:13:01,770 --> 02:13:05,550
Alright, anyway.

1970
02:13:06,610 --> 02:13:07,710
I'm sorry.

1971
02:13:08,170 --> 02:13:15,030
I know I sang explicit Luigi's blood during your Christmas session.

1972
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:18,070
I'm not doing your Christmas holiday.

1973
02:13:20,550 --> 02:13:25,450
The reason why you're commenting is because you're the VTuber Aaron Hansen embracing.

1974
02:13:26,010 --> 02:13:27,870
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

1975
02:13:28,030 --> 02:13:30,210
I don't know if that's a compliment or an insult.

1976
02:13:30,610 --> 02:13:31,290
I don't know.

1977
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:34,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1978
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:37,070
Thank you, thank you.

1979
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:39,350
Sing peaches.

1980
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:40,330
Okay, wait.

1981
02:13:40,450 --> 02:13:41,490
Is it on carophone?

1982
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:42,870
If it is, I'll sing it.

1983
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:44,290
Alright.

1984
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:45,610
Oh, it is.

1985
02:13:45,730 --> 02:13:45,950
Alright.

1986
02:13:46,650 --> 02:13:48,110
Encore number three.

1987
02:13:48,710 --> 02:13:49,350

1988
02:13:49,810 --> 02:13:51,850
Bro, you gotta invite me to the house now.

1989
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:52,530
Come on.

1990
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:53,590
Alright.

1991
02:13:55,130 --> 02:13:58,850
This one is for my one and only true love.

1992
02:13:59,750 --> 02:14:00,990
Princess Peach.

1993
02:14:01,250 --> 02:14:05,490
I've never sang this song, but Peach, you're so cool.

1994
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:11,590
And with my star, we're gonna rule.

1995
02:14:13,370 --> 02:14:15,690
Peach, understand.

1996
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:21,990
I'm gonna love you till the very end.

1997
02:14:23,550 --> 02:14:32,050

2005
02:15:41,070 --> 02:15:44,190
That's literally the second time I've heard this song today

2006
02:15:48,170 --> 02:15:51,710
Do you think I nailed it for my second time?

02:20:54,750 --> 02:20:58,890
I've always, I don't know, apparently the newest Disney songs fucking suck.

2051
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:01,190
I 100% they're terrible.

2052
02:21:03,230 --> 02:21:08,410
Actually, literally that's the only part I like because it's so fucking stupid.

2053
02:21:08,850 --> 02:21:10,550
Apparently the new, what was it?

2054
02:21:11,890 --> 02:21:13,110
What was the sequel they made?

2055
02:21:13,170 --> 02:21:14,830
Oh, yeah, Moana 2 was fucking terrible.

2056
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:18,750
The song, apparently the songs for Moana 2 were really, really bad.

2057
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:24,110
Like all the most recent Disney musicals and stuff like that are really bad.

2058
02:21:26,050 --> 02:21:28,030
Like, I can't believe it.

2059
02:21:29,050 --> 02:21:29,530
Sad.

2060
02:21:31,310 --> 02:21:34,310
Good sound writing is when you say the same thing three times in a row.

2061
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:37,070
Bravo, Lin-Manuel Miranda.

2062
02:21:39,390 --> 02:21:40,350
Actual showdown.

2063
02:21:40,450 --> 02:21:41,350
Thank you for the super chat.

2064
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:41,710
Thank you.

2065
02:21:41,730 --> 02:21:42,270
Thank you.

2066
02:21:42,890 --> 02:21:44,730
Have you heard the scuttlebutt?

2067
02:21:44,730 --> 02:21:46,910
Well, uh, stick a butter.

2068
02:21:47,010 --> 02:21:48,390
Thank you for the akasupa.

2069
02:21:48,690 --> 02:21:49,050
Thank you.

2070
02:21:49,070 --> 02:21:51,850
Thank you, but a scuttlebutt.

2071
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:54,810
Have you heard of the scuttlebutt?

2072
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:57,530
Wow, the scuttlebutt.

2073
02:22:00,590 --> 02:22:02,490
All right, let's see what I can find.

2074
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:03,110
Let's see.

2075
02:22:03,710 --> 02:22:05,230
This is...

2076
02:22:05,230 --> 02:22:06,410
Do they have this one?

2077
02:22:06,590 --> 02:22:07,190
Okay, wait.

2078
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:09,250
Or maybe this one?

2079
02:22:10,990 --> 02:22:14,630
Oh my god, I'm looking up some really cursed songs right now.

2080
02:22:14,730 --> 02:22:16,330
And see if they have it.

2081
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:19,630
Hey Digimon, hey Digimon.

2082
02:22:22,290 --> 02:22:23,870
Hey Digimon, hey Digimon.

2083
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:30,610
They don't have Digimon, but they have Butterfly, but we know that's not what we're here for.

2084
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:35,890
What can I say except you're welcome.

2085
02:22:35,890 --> 02:22:36,470
Um...

2086
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:44,690
Let's see, stick a butter.

2087
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:47,230
Anyway, did I already say thank you to akasupa to stick a butter?

2088
02:22:47,350 --> 02:22:48,530
Thank you again if I didn't.

2089
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:48,910
Thank you.

2090
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:49,790
Thank you.

2091
02:22:52,470 --> 02:22:55,070
All right, I'll do one more encore.

2092
02:22:56,830 --> 02:22:58,730
I'll do... Sorry, I'm just...

2093
02:22:58,730 --> 02:22:59,970
It's been a while, Kiri.

2094
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:02,230
This has been a two hour and 30 minute Kiri.

2095
02:23:02,270 --> 02:23:03,990
Okay, I was having way too much fun.

2096
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:06,610
Just shitposting my karaoke.

2097
02:23:08,850 --> 02:23:15,690
After Christmas caroling, I was like I can sing anything, but my vibe might disappear, but I can...

2098
02:23:17,210 --> 02:23:19,090
I'm definitely not monetized.

2099
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:22,170
That's for sure, but like I can sing anything.

2100
02:23:26,510 --> 02:23:30,350
I just I like opened my eyes about it.

2101
02:23:30,690 --> 02:23:31,670
Let's see.

2102
02:23:32,570 --> 02:23:34,790
I'm checking if there's anything I want to sing.

2103
02:23:35,210 --> 02:23:40,790
Yeah, anything else I want to sing before I get invited into your home.

2104
02:23:42,710 --> 02:23:43,750
Let's see.

2105
02:23:47,450 --> 02:23:49,570
I think I found it.

2106
02:24:02,770 --> 02:24:04,690
You're gonna invite me to your house.

2107
02:24:04,770 --> 02:24:05,850
Oh, wait, let's go.

2108
02:24:07,610 --> 02:24:08,330
This one.

2109
02:24:10,190 --> 02:24:11,630
This is what we're here for.

2110
02:24:13,610 --> 02:24:15,110
Wait, actually, no, wait.

2111
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:16,410
Wait, not this one.

2112
02:24:16,570 --> 02:24:18,590
I'll do... Wait, do they have this other one?

2113
02:24:19,130 --> 02:24:19,670
It'll be funny.

2114
02:24:19,730 --> 02:24:21,430
You guys can predict exactly what...

2115
02:24:22,850 --> 02:24:25,350
Is this what I think it is?

2116
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:39,870
I don't know, but I'll find out.

2117
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:08,450
Built a tent and say the world is dry.

2118
02:25:08,590 --> 02:25:09,730
Chocolate rain.

2119
02:25:11,210 --> 02:25:13,970
Zoom the camera out and see the light.

2120
02:25:14,050 --> 02:25:15,030
Chocolate rain.

2121
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:18,930
Forecast BB falling yesterday.

2122
02:25:19,370 --> 02:25:20,250
Chocolate rain.

2123
02:25:21,630 --> 02:25:24,450
Only in the past is what they say.

2124
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:25,890
Chocolate rain.

2125
02:25:27,170 --> 02:25:29,730
Raise your neighborhood insurance rate.

2126
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:31,390
Chocolate rain.

2127
02:25:32,210 --> 02:25:35,150
Make us happy living in the game.

2128
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:36,300
Chocolate rain.

2129
02:25:38,010 --> 02:25:40,470
Made me cross the street the other day.

2130
02:25:40,770 --> 02:25:42,030
Chocolate rain.

2131
02:25:42,970 --> 02:25:45,790
Made you turn your head the other way.

2132
02:25:46,090 --> 02:25:47,230
Chocolate rain.

2133
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:51,110
History quickly crashing through the waves.

2134
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:52,530
Chocolate rain.

2135
02:25:53,770 --> 02:25:56,350
Using you to fall back down again.

2136
02:25:56,630 --> 02:25:57,850
Chocolate rain.

2137
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:12,390
Dude, that's four minutes to help them mention on the radio.

2138
02:26:12,690 --> 02:26:13,790
Chocolate rain.

2139
02:26:15,370 --> 02:26:17,750
It's a fear your leaders call control.

2140
02:26:17,990 --> 02:26:19,430
Chocolate rain.

2141
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:21,730
Worse than sweating.

2142
02:26:22,010 --> 02:26:23,170
Worse than calling names.

2143
02:26:23,310 --> 02:26:24,430
Chocolate rain.

2144
02:26:25,810 --> 02:26:27,830
Say it publicly and you're in trouble.

2145
02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:27,830
Chocolate rain.

2146
02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:28,450
You're insane.

2147
02:26:28,710 --> 02:26:30,170
Chocolate rain.

2148
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:33,870
No one wants to hear about it now.

2149
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:34,550
I can't.

2150
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:12,540
Finish the song.

2151
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,620
Finish the song.

2152
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:24,820
You wanted to finish it now.

2153
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:32,740
Okay, all right, here we go.

2154
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:38,100
Wish, wish real hard it goes away somehow.

2155
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:39,580
Chocolate rain.

2156
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:43,600
Make the best of friends begin the fight.

2157
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:44,740
Chocolate rain.

2158
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:49,900
But did they know each other and they're like chocolate rain.

2159
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:54,200
Every February washed away.

2160
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:55,260
Chocolate rain.

2161
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:59,520
Stays behind as colors celebrate.

2162
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:00,780
Chocolate rain.

2163
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:04,880
The same crime has a higher price to pay.

2164
02:28:05,240 --> 02:28:06,020
Chocolate rain.

2165
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:10,340
The judge and jury swear is not the face.

2166
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:11,420
Chocolate rain.

2167
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:15,640
History quickly crashing through your veins.

2168
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:16,660
Chocolate rain.

2169
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:20,800
Using you to fall back down again.

2170
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:21,940
Chocolate rain.

2171
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:36,760
Dirty secrets of economy.

2172
02:28:36,980 --> 02:28:38,080
Chocolate rain.

2173
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:41,900
Turns that body into GDP.

2174
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:43,780
Chocolate rain.

2175
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:47,240
The bell curve blames the baby's DNA.

2176
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:49,180
Chocolate rain.

2177
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:51,920
But test scores are how much they're worth.

2178
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:51,920
Chocolate rain.

2179
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:54,240
Parents make chocolate rain.

2180
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:58,340
Flipping cars in France the other night.

2181
02:28:58,800 --> 02:28:59,760
Chocolate rain.

2182
02:29:01,060 --> 02:29:03,520
Cleans the sewer else beneath Mumbai.

2183
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:04,700
Chocolate Mumbai.

2184
02:29:05,940 --> 02:29:08,020
Cross the world and back.

2185
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:08,940
It's all the same.

2186
02:29:09,100 --> 02:29:10,200
Chocolate rain.

2187
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:14,240
Angels cry and shake their heads in shame.

2188
02:29:14,400 --> 02:29:15,780
Chocolate rain.

2189
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:19,600
Lifts the arc of paradise insane.

2190
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:20,680
Chocolate rain.

2191
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:25,160
Which part do you think you're living in?

2192
02:29:25,420 --> 02:29:26,380
Chocolate rain.

2193
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:30,340
More than marching, more than passing love.

2194
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:31,280
Chocolate rain.

2195
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:35,580
Remake how we got to where we are.

2196
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:36,640
Chocolate rain.

2197
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:41,040
History quickly crashing through your veins.

2198
02:29:41,220 --> 02:29:42,500
Chocolate rain.

2199
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:46,220
Using you to fall back down again.

2200
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:47,720
Chocolate rain.

2201
02:29:48,900 --> 02:29:51,820
History quickly crashing through your veins.

2202
02:29:52,380 --> 02:29:53,120
Chocolate rain.

2203
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:56,940
Using you to fall back down again.

2204
02:29:57,180 --> 02:29:58,040
Chocolate rain.

2205
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,680
Oh my god.

2206
02:30:01,100 --> 02:30:02,860
Oh my god.

2207
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:07,620
I felt like I sang this song for 20 years.

2208
02:30:08,220 --> 02:30:09,820
Oh my god.

2209
02:30:16,290 --> 02:30:18,490
Oh my god.

2210
02:30:18,650 --> 02:30:19,930
This shit is long.

2211
02:30:19,930 --> 02:30:21,510
It doesn't end.

2212
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:24,970
I didn't realize how long this song was until now.

2213
02:30:24,990 --> 02:30:27,310
I only listened to the first minute.

2214
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:31,230
I've never listened to the full song.

2215
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:37,210
I didn't realize this song was 5 minutes long.

2216
02:30:37,350 --> 02:30:40,490
It's 5 minutes long and it's 2 chords.

2217
02:30:45,330 --> 02:30:49,210
It's 5 minutes long of the same melody!

2218
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:56,110
Holy shit, I didn't realize it was like that!

2219
02:30:56,570 --> 02:31:00,150
Alright, alright.

2220
02:31:00,870 --> 02:31:02,170
Okay, okay, okay.

2221
02:31:02,410 --> 02:31:07,710
Last, last, last, last, last, last song before you invite me in.

2222
02:31:08,390 --> 02:31:08,710
Right?

2223
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:10,310
You're gonna invite me in, right?

2224
02:31:10,310 --> 02:31:12,190
Dragons, right?

2225
02:31:12,610 --> 02:31:14,370
You're gonna let me inside, right?

2226
02:31:14,490 --> 02:31:14,910
Dragons!

2227
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:23,470
Alright, alright, last song.

2228
02:31:24,610 --> 02:31:26,010
The very last song.

2229
02:31:26,530 --> 02:31:30,170
I don't know if, like, I hope the volume will be okay for this because, like, I don't know.

2230
02:31:30,690 --> 02:31:30,950
Alright.

2231
02:31:32,770 --> 02:31:34,430
Alright, I'm gonna fumble this.

2232
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:35,530
Alright.

2233
02:31:35,530 --> 02:31:39,010
I don't remember how to actually sing this song.

2234
02:31:43,370 --> 02:31:44,130
Alright.

2235
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:57,180
Someday, we'll have our last conversation and drink our last cup of coffee.

2236
02:31:58,100 --> 02:32:05,720
Someday, we might be 80 and think about the different things we used to say.

2237
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:13,140
All the memories of you will just become a ghost of a smile caught in the wind.

2238
02:32:14,060 --> 02:32:18,740
Someday, it'll be the last day.

2239
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:41,350
I won't forget how it feels to be loved, to be remembered by someone as special as you.

2240
02:32:41,350 --> 02:32:52,450
Someday, I will drink that last cup of coffee with a smile.

2241
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:10,780
Yeah?

2242
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:13,460
Do you forgive me now?

2243
02:33:13,580 --> 02:33:14,380
Can I come in?

2244
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:20,940
Can I come in now, guys?

2245
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:22,420
Can I come in?

2246
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:24,020
Yeah?

2247
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:25,640
Good, I'm already inside.

2248
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:28,440
Wow!

2249
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:29,700
So, my God!

2250
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:30,560
See, I told you.

2251
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,680
Wow, Mr. Rich Guy over here.

2252
02:33:33,880 --> 02:33:34,200
Whoa!

2253
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:39,260
Oh, my God!

2254
02:33:39,740 --> 02:33:40,660
You live here?

2255
02:33:40,980 --> 02:33:42,540
Oh, my God!

2256
02:33:44,620 --> 02:33:45,220
Wow!

2257
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:47,240
Look at this place!

2258
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:48,180
Crazy!

2259
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:50,320
I can't believe you live here.

2260
02:33:52,980 --> 02:33:54,560
Thank you for the super chat.

2261
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:55,580
Thank you, thank you.

2262
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:56,420
Let's get it, Doki.

2263
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:57,980
I'm a doge in here, too.

2264
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:01,940
Damn!

2265
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:05,380
I can't believe you live in this place like this.

2266
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:07,220
Whose house is that?

2267
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:10,080
That's your house.

2268
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:11,000
What do you mean?

2269
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:13,240
Maddie, thank you for the Akasupa.

2270
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:14,680
Thank you, thank you.

2271
02:34:14,820 --> 02:34:15,960
Dragoon Red super chat.

2272
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:17,080
Merry Christmas, Doki.

2273
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,440
It's been an amazing year.

2274
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:25,640
Thank you for the Akasupa.

2275
02:34:25,720 --> 02:34:26,280
Oh, my God!

2276
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:27,900
Thank you for all the Akasupa!

2277
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:32,860
Thank you for the super chat that you can't make me feel sad after the past 30 minutes.

2278
02:34:34,120 --> 02:34:38,440
I think I like the last three of the other songs are like absolute shitposts.

2279
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,200
And I'm like, now it's time for you to be sad.

2280
02:34:43,060 --> 02:34:45,940
Not sad, but now it's time for you to cry.

2281
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:49,240
That's right.

2282
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:54,640
Let's get some Christmas music in the background, too.

2283
02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:00,160
Let's see, royalty-free Christmas songs.

2284
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:03,960
What the f- Okay.

2285
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:06,360
Oh, okay.

2286
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:07,740
Sorry, that's Jacksfilms.

2287
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:11,920
I was like, royalty-free Christmas songs?

2288
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:14,360
And I realized that's from Jacksfilms.

2289
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:15,360
And I was like, what the?

2290
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:17,040
It, like, scared me.

2291
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:19,000
I was like, what the fuck was that?

2292
02:35:21,180 --> 02:35:21,980
Like, Jacksfilms.

2293
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:24,440
Yeah, I got scared, too, guys.

2294
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:25,980
I got scared.

2295
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:33,040
It was- It's literally- I looked up royalty-free Christmas songs, and it was the first thing.

2296
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:35,440
Like, it was literally the first result.

2297
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:38,020
Oh, my God.

2298
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:40,220
Thank you all for the Akasupa.

2299
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:42,800
Thank you, thank you, everyone.

2300
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:44,400
I really appreciate it.

2301
02:35:44,820 --> 02:35:46,960
Guys, I'm gonna take off my fucking nose.

2302
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:47,960
Give me a sec.

2303
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:49,400
I'm gonna take it off.

2304
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,220
Alright, and then...

2305
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:53,040
Thank you, everybody.

2306
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:54,620
I had a lot of fun.

2307
02:35:54,760 --> 02:35:56,240
So many Red Supas.

2308
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:56,960
Merry Christmas.

2309
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,040
I need to get drunk.

2310
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:01,320
Thank you for the- Thank you for the Akasupa.

2311
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:02,860
Parbo, thank you for the Akasupa.

2312
02:36:02,940 --> 02:36:03,700
Thank you, everybody.

2313
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:05,520
Oh, there's so many- Oh, my God.

2314
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:08,340
Sorry, I'm zooming in and out because I'm fucking- Oh, my God.

2315
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:09,180
It's so emotional.

2316
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:10,020
Wow.

2317
02:36:14,440 --> 02:36:15,460
Oh, my God.

2318
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:17,060
I really appreciate it, everyone.

2319
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:19,320
Hope you guys had a lot of fun.

2320
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:23,160
I'm- Honestly, I had something else planned for the holidays, for Christmas.

2321
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:26,640
But, obviously, it didn't come through.

2322
02:36:27,140 --> 02:36:31,000
But, like, I'm so very happy to be able to still spend Christmas with you guys.

2323
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:33,440
Spend the special holidays with all of you.

2324
02:36:33,580 --> 02:36:36,920
It really was- It was really a great time.

2325
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:44,700
I'm so happy to be able to spend it with my Dragoons, since I don't have any- I won't have it any other way.

2326
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:47,440
And I hope you guys had a great time spending your holidays with me.

2327
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:48,700
Oh, yeah.

2328
02:36:48,900 --> 02:36:52,080
I mean, this isn't really a Christmas present, but I really want to show you guys this.

2329
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:54,540
But...

2330
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:58,680
My- The Dragoons reference sheet is finally officially done!

2331
02:36:58,880 --> 02:36:59,080
Done!

2332
02:36:59,640 --> 02:37:00,900
So, I'll show you what it looks like.

2333
02:37:00,980 --> 02:37:01,920
Whoa, okay, here we go.

2334
02:37:02,660 --> 02:37:03,060
Look!

2335
02:37:04,100 --> 02:37:05,280
That's you guys!

2336
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:09,240
The official reference sheet is finally finished!

2337
02:37:10,160 --> 02:37:13,580
I have a few edits and everything to make.

2338
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:18,340
But, like, I just wanted to show you guys this.

2339
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:21,620
Before, like, I do some small little edits and everything.

2340
02:37:21,700 --> 02:37:22,260
It's just tech.

2341
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:22,820
It's just layout.

2342
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:25,440
All the illustrations are finalized.

2343
02:37:26,780 --> 02:37:31,340
It's just I'm here to fix the layout of everything to make it look prettier.

2344
02:37:31,420 --> 02:37:32,680
Like, the overlay and everything.

2345
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:35,020
And the text placement and stuff.

2346
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:37,660
So, yeah!

2347
02:37:38,140 --> 02:37:42,420
I think it's- I think this is really- I love how it all came out and everything.

2348
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:44,600
And I love the little lore that we have in there.

2349
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:52,040
I just thought it was incre- I thought it looked really cute!

2350
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:55,240
I thought everything looks amazing and really cute.

2351
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:57,860
And everything.

2352
02:37:58,300 --> 02:38:03,360
But, I'm super happy to be here for another year.

2353
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:08,440
I cannot- I'll be more sentimental on our New Year countdown chat.

2354
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:10,020
But don't worry.

2355
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:13,120
We'll be a lot more sentimental during the New Year countdown.

2356
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:16,640
Where we look through, you know, all the stuff that happened this year.

2357
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:19,320
But for now, let's think about the holiday cheer.

2358
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:22,160
And spending time together, Dragons.

2359
02:38:22,780 --> 02:38:23,260
Noriko!

2360
02:38:23,400 --> 02:38:25,140
They gave me the five gifted chips!

2361
02:38:25,240 --> 02:38:26,140
Thank you, thank you!

2362
02:38:26,140 --> 02:38:29,740
I'm going to sub because I did a ten hour fucking Twitch stream of Marvel Rivals!

2363
02:38:34,180 --> 02:38:35,140
But, yeah!

2364
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:40,200
I hope you guys- We started off Christmas-y and then later on we got very shitpost-y.

2365
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:46,620
I feel like I was- It was all over the place.

2366
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:50,680
Today was- Today's stream was all over the place.

2367
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:53,080
And like, I- Honestly, I was improv-ing.

2368
02:38:53,240 --> 02:38:55,340
Like, I was doing everything live.

2369
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:58,580
I was improv-ing like 70% of that.

2370
02:39:00,120 --> 02:39:04,440
I was trying to set up- For you guys.

2371
02:39:08,340 --> 02:39:09,400
It wasn't great.

2372
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:11,140
Oh, you guys had a great Christmas.

2373
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:17,140
For me, I ordered too much- Before this stream, I ordered way too much food because I was talking to a friend.

2374
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:19,360
I was just like- Because they were like, Merry Christmas!

2375
02:39:19,540 --> 02:39:20,620
I was like, Merry Christmas!

2376
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:22,280
And I was ordering food.

2377
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:24,400
And I was like, should I order from two different restaurants?

2378
02:39:24,460 --> 02:39:27,120
Because I really want to eat these two specific things.

2379
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:31,580
And then, I accidentally ordered an entire- Um...

2380
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:33,180
Entire chicken.

2381
02:39:33,740 --> 02:39:34,320
Like...

2382
02:39:34,320 --> 02:39:39,320
I ordered a full chicken.

2383
02:39:39,980 --> 02:39:42,160
And if you guys don't know how much that is...

2384
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:44,260
It came in two boxes.

2385
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:51,040
It came- It came in two boxes!

2386
02:39:51,560 --> 02:39:52,860
Because they were cutting it!

2387
02:39:52,980 --> 02:39:57,740
And I didn't- I thought- I thought I ordered a half order.

2388
02:39:58,500 --> 02:40:01,560
But I accidentally ordered an entire chicken.

2389
02:40:02,820 --> 02:40:05,920
But the thing is, it wasn't the only thing I ordered.

2390
02:40:06,440 --> 02:40:08,420
I also ordered like...

2391
02:40:08,420 --> 02:40:09,700
Char siu and...

2392
02:40:09,700 --> 02:40:11,220
Char siu and...

2393
02:40:11,220 --> 02:40:11,980
Uh...

2394
02:40:11,980 --> 02:40:13,940
Barbecued duck on rice.

2395
02:40:14,380 --> 02:40:18,480
Because I was just like- I was really craving, like, classic Hong Kong food.

2396
02:40:18,740 --> 02:40:19,920
So I ordered that.

2397
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:21,340
Plus...

2398
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:23,300
The Hainanese chicken hot pot.

2399
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:26,120
But the chicken was in two boxes!

2400
02:40:26,780 --> 02:40:27,300
And then...

2401
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:30,600
From the other restaurant, I really wanted dumplings.

2402
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:33,300
So I was like, I'm gonna order some dumplings too.

2403
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:34,780
So I ordered dumplings.

2404
02:40:35,020 --> 02:40:36,300
But it came after.

2405
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:38,140
It came like...

2406
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:40,540
It came like 30 minutes after.

2407
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:43,560
So I was like, well, I'm fucking full now.

2408
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:47,020
And then, not only did I order dumplings from the other restaurant...

2409
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:48,660
I also ordered...

2410
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:52,940
I also ordered, like, some cold noodles.

2411
02:40:53,060 --> 02:40:55,740
With spicy cold noodles with sesame sauce on it.

2412
02:40:55,780 --> 02:40:58,040
Because I was just like, I'll just have a little bit of everything.

2413
02:40:58,540 --> 02:41:04,060
Because I'm- I just- It's Christmas, and I want to set up- I just want to have a nice day.

2414
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:05,220
Because I didn't eat lunch.

2415
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:06,960
I woke up at 4 fucking PM.

2416
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:14,860
Oh my god.

2417
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:17,060
I was like...

2418
02:41:17,060 --> 02:41:18,020
I was like...

2419
02:41:18,020 --> 02:41:18,800
Oh my god.

2420
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:22,520
I was just like, whoop.

2421
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:26,260
Yes, I have leftovers for the next week, apparently.

2422
02:41:29,180 --> 02:41:30,240
Oh my god.

2423
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:33,200
Merry Christmas, everybody.

2424
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:34,480
Merry, merry Christmas.

2425
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:37,800
Yeah, I'm so happy to spend it with all of you guys.

2426
02:41:38,280 --> 02:41:39,060
Oh my god, what a year.

2427
02:41:39,140 --> 02:41:40,100
What a fucking year.

2428
02:41:40,420 --> 02:41:40,920
Oh my gosh.

2429
02:41:40,980 --> 02:41:42,140
Oh yeah, I forgot.

2430
02:41:42,300 --> 02:41:43,400
I need to show this one thing.

2431
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:45,640
But...

2432
02:41:45,640 --> 02:41:47,160
If you're in Hong Kong...

2433
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:51,720
I'm gonna be doing a very special fan meet in Hong Kong.

2434
02:41:52,080 --> 02:41:55,160
And I would really mean a lot to see you guys.

2435
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:56,220
Because like...

2436
02:41:56,220 --> 02:41:58,200
As- Wait, let me grab the links.

2437
02:41:58,320 --> 02:42:00,600
I can- Guys, I'm doing it all live.

2438
02:42:04,180 --> 02:42:07,340
There's also exclusive merch too being sold.

2439
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:07,940
But yes.

2440
02:42:09,620 --> 02:42:12,240
Hong Kong fan meet.

2441
02:42:12,900 --> 02:42:16,040
I would really appreciate seeing all of you guys there.

2442
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:20,180
If you are traveling to Hong Kong, it's gonna be on January 11th.

2443
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:21,620
So yeah.

2444
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:26,740
Purchase your tickets and grab some exclusive merch over there.

2445
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:29,680
I really wanna go- I really miss Hong Kong.

2446
02:42:29,820 --> 02:42:30,660
I wanna go back there.

2447
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:33,300
I'm planning on going back there next year.

2448
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:34,400
So like...

2449
02:42:34,400 --> 02:42:40,640
I'm super excited because it's been so long since I've been back.

2450
02:42:40,700 --> 02:42:45,200
I think it's been like 5 or 6 plus years since I've been back.

2451
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:50,980
Because when COVID happened, I never- It's been a long- Basically, I haven't gone back since COVID.

2452
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:53,780
But I also haven't gone back even before COVID.

2453
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:55,260
But like, ah man.

2454
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:55,840
But yes.

2455
02:42:57,080 --> 02:42:57,800
Please purchase.

2456
02:42:58,260 --> 02:42:59,340
Sorry, whoop, dad's here.

2457
02:42:59,460 --> 02:43:00,580
Sorry, dad's gone again.

2458
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:04,200
He comes in and out because like...

2459
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:06,540
There's a reason why.

2460
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:07,840
But here's dad again.

2461
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:10,140
And he's gonna disappear again soon.

2462
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:11,080
But yes.

2463
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:14,400
My fan meet right here.

2464
02:43:14,400 --> 02:43:14,880
Guys.

2465
02:43:15,180 --> 02:43:17,040
There's a lot of community posts I need to make.

2466
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:19,240
Maybe I still don't know.

2467
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:19,980
Please.

2468
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:21,180
Come to Hong Kong.

2469
02:43:21,380 --> 02:43:23,620
If you've never been to Hong Kong, you should totally come to Hong Kong.

2470
02:43:24,340 --> 02:43:25,260
It's great.

2471
02:43:25,460 --> 02:43:28,720
It's actually a great place.

2472
02:43:28,940 --> 02:43:29,520
Great place.

2473
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:31,900
Honestly, I love the food there.

2474
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:32,960
It's also really nice.

2475
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:33,380
But yes.

2476
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:36,540
If you're not from Hong Kong, you should totally come over too.

2477
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:42,900
I heard there's gonna be like lots of fun stuff there at the fan meet.

2478
02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:44,420
But yeah.

2479
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:45,800
I'm super excited.

2480
02:43:46,360 --> 02:43:47,080
Please visit.

2481
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:51,640
Buy tickets now.

2482
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:54,640
Good thing.

2483
02:43:54,720 --> 02:43:55,700
I almost forgot to show this.

2484
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:58,320
Because I had to show this.

2485
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:01,340
Because they're like, can you please talk about this on stream?

2486
02:44:01,400 --> 02:44:02,220
And I was like, I will.

2487
02:44:02,320 --> 02:44:02,800
Don't worry.

2488
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:04,180
And I forgot to yesterday.

2489
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:05,500
So I was like, I'm gonna do it now.

2490
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:09,240
I was like, oh my god.

2491
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:09,520
Okay.

2492
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:10,760
I'm gonna remember now.

2493
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,560
I'm a professional.

2494
02:44:11,560 --> 02:44:13,200
I'm a fucking professional.

2495
02:44:19,860 --> 02:44:21,400
Delta, thank you for the superchat.

2496
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:23,720
Thank you for the congratulations on an amazing stream and amazing year.

2497
02:44:23,780 --> 02:44:24,960
Just being genuinely amazing.

2498
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:26,220
Merry Christmas Doki Bird.

2499
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:27,600
Merry Christmas Little Dragons.

2500
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:29,340
To an amazing 2025 together.

2501
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:29,940
Yes!

2502
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:32,060
I'm super excited for 2025.

2503
02:44:32,540 --> 02:44:35,840
And spending the new year countdown with you guys.

2504
02:44:35,940 --> 02:44:39,640
I'm super duper excited for it.

2505
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:44,320
Because I'll be releasing transparent PNGs of the Dragoons.

2506
02:44:44,460 --> 02:44:45,800
Because we're going to follow tradition.

2507
02:44:46,220 --> 02:44:49,220
And you can submit your own Dragoon Sona to me.

2508
02:44:49,540 --> 02:44:51,120
I'll make a tweet about it.

2509
02:44:51,500 --> 02:44:53,800
Like, maybe tomorrow or today.

2510
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:54,860
I don't know.

2511
02:44:55,180 --> 02:44:56,060
I'm a wild card.

2512
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:59,460
Depending on if I'm fucking gone in the Marvel Rivals minds.

2513
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:06,240
It really depends on if right after the stream, I'm just fucking gone in the Marvel Rivals minds.

2514
02:45:09,660 --> 02:45:11,260
So it's a 50-50.

2515
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:13,340
If it's going to be today or tomorrow.

2516
02:45:16,280 --> 02:45:23,780
But I will be releasing the transparent PNGs of the Dragoons.

2517
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:25,800
So you can make your own Dragoon Sonas.

2518
02:45:26,360 --> 02:45:28,480
So we can do a countdown together.

2519
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:29,320
As always.

2520
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:30,360
As per tradition.

2521
02:45:32,940 --> 02:45:39,960
I'm always super happy to just hang out with all of you guys.

2522
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:43,800
And just be there with you guys.

2523
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,780
And you guys made this Christmas amazing.

2524
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:53,260
I mean, I always love celebrating it with my fans and my community and everything.

2525
02:45:55,100 --> 02:45:56,260
Thank you for the superchat.

2526
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:56,920
Thank you, thank you.

2527
02:45:56,940 --> 02:45:58,320
Yeah, delay no more.

2528
02:45:58,720 --> 02:45:59,420
Thank you.

2529
02:45:59,420 --> 02:46:00,440
Thank you for the superchat.

2530
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:00,800
Thank you.

2531
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:01,620
Thank you.

2532
02:46:01,960 --> 02:46:03,580
There's so many things going on.

2533
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:05,400
I'm like trying to catch up with everything.

2534
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:08,160
Marvel Rivals could not have released at a worse fucking time.

2535
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:09,000
I'm not gonna lie.

2536
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:14,260
They couldn't have released at a worse time.

2537
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:18,720
Trying to catch up with everything.

2538
02:46:22,360 --> 02:46:24,440
Yeah, I hope you guys had a great holiday.

2539
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:27,260
I mean, I have a lot of other stuff planned for 2025.

2540
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:28,880
I mean, I had stuff planned for this year.

2541
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:30,180
That's to be pushed to 2025.

2542
02:46:30,480 --> 02:46:32,000
Because I was just so overworked.

2543
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:33,460
There's been so many things going on.

2544
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:38,120
But I'm hoping to chill a little more.

2545
02:46:38,920 --> 02:46:41,800
And for the next week or two.

2546
02:46:41,960 --> 02:46:44,360
If I get back into the whole grind again.

2547
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:48,560
But yeah, I can't believe we've been streaming for three hours now.

2548
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:52,780
I got like really lost in the script of my Christmas karaoke.

2549
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:55,440
I'm sorry for being an hour late.

2550
02:46:56,280 --> 02:46:59,020
Setup took a lot longer than I thought it would.

2551
02:46:59,400 --> 02:47:02,380
Because I had a lot of fucking dumb ideas in my head.

2552
02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:04,320
And I realized I fucked up.

2553
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:07,860
I forgot the most important thing of the setup.

2554
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:15,520
I still hope you guys enjoyed it and everything.

2555
02:47:15,740 --> 02:47:17,760
I think it's because I woke up way too late for setup.

2556
02:47:18,860 --> 02:47:21,080
It usually takes me like an hour.

2557
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:24,660
An hour and a half to set up all my scenes for it.

2558
02:47:24,660 --> 02:47:26,500
But I hope you guys still...

2559
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:30,320
I hope you guys enjoyed the theme of everything.

2560
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:35,680
Anyway guys.

2561
02:47:37,720 --> 02:47:39,300
I'm gonna call it here.

2562
02:47:39,780 --> 02:47:41,860
Thank you all for the Akasupa's.

2563
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:43,160
I hope you guys had...

2564
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:44,360
And all the superchats.

2565
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:45,760
And all the subs.

2566
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:48,600
And all the memberships.

2567
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:52,820
I hope you guys had a great, great Christmas.

2568
02:47:52,820 --> 02:47:55,100
Spending it time with me.

2569
02:47:57,600 --> 02:48:00,520
Also, we're gonna have a new emote.

2570
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:01,680
By the way.

2571
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:03,100
I'll show it to you guys.

2572
02:48:03,160 --> 02:48:04,000
You guys might recognize.

2573
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:05,760
I'm asking for a few edits.

2574
02:48:05,940 --> 02:48:07,280
Sorry, that's gonna disappear for a sec.

2575
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:09,380
Because I'm starting to save this.

2576
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:10,080
And then he's back.

2577
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:13,740
But I'll show you guys this.

2578
02:48:14,260 --> 02:48:15,340
We have a new emote.

2579
02:48:16,660 --> 02:48:17,100
Here.

2580
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:19,820
You might recognize what this face is supposed to be.

2581
02:48:24,470 --> 02:48:29,130
I really wanted to have this particular face.

2582
02:48:29,410 --> 02:48:38,480
The side eye.

2583
02:48:45,740 --> 02:48:46,860
So yeah.

2584
02:48:46,940 --> 02:48:47,800
That's gonna be a new emote.

2585
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:49,580
I'm just gonna get a few edits made to it.

2586
02:48:49,660 --> 02:48:51,520
And then we're gonna have it soon.

2587
02:48:51,980 --> 02:48:52,540
Anyway.

2588
02:48:54,660 --> 02:48:55,200
Oh yeah.

2589
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:55,620
I mean.

2590
02:48:55,780 --> 02:48:56,720
Since it's the holidays.

2591
02:48:56,860 --> 02:48:58,480
I can show you guys more stuff before I go.

2592
02:48:58,820 --> 02:48:58,960
Wait.

2593
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:00,480
I have so many things to show you guys.

2594
02:49:00,580 --> 02:49:00,860
Actually.

2595
02:49:01,220 --> 02:49:03,500
Actually, I have a lot of things to show you guys.

2596
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:04,320
Not gonna lie.

2597
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:08,220
I actually have a lot.

2598
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:08,860
It's not.

2599
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:11,900
Let me see.

2600
02:49:12,220 --> 02:49:13,560
That's gonna disappear again.

2601
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:15,000
Because I need to save this.

2602
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:17,580
Actually, I have a lot of stuff working in the background.

2603
02:49:18,620 --> 02:49:19,820
And I need to answer them.

2604
02:49:19,860 --> 02:49:21,640
Because I'm a little late in answering these.

2605
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:22,760
I'm sorry.

2606
02:49:22,880 --> 02:49:23,880
I'm so sorry.

2607
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:27,060
They've been like on standby on these for so long.

2608
02:49:27,100 --> 02:49:31,180
But I had so many million other things going on in the background.

2609
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:33,720
But.

2610
02:49:33,900 --> 02:49:35,340
I'm gonna have a.

2611
02:49:36,020 --> 02:49:36,900
I'm sorry.

2612
02:49:36,980 --> 02:49:38,300
That's just gonna jump in and out.

2613
02:49:38,620 --> 02:49:41,040
I'm gonna have a little chibi model.

2614
02:49:41,660 --> 02:49:43,120
I got very inspired by.

2615
02:49:45,440 --> 02:49:48,720
Mint's chibi skin suit.

2616
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:53,220
And I got very inspired by Mint's chibi skin suit.

2617
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:54,860
It's not the same artist.

2618
02:49:55,220 --> 02:49:55,660
But.

2619
02:49:58,380 --> 02:49:59,200
That's me.

2620
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:01,120
That's me.

2621
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:04,640
Wow.

2622
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:06,420
That's mini me.

2623
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:10,500
It's being worked on right now.

2624
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:11,360
Well, to be fair.

2625
02:50:11,440 --> 02:50:11,780
It's almost.

2626
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:13,200
It was almost done a month ago.

2627
02:50:13,280 --> 02:50:14,480
And then I got really busy.

2628
02:50:14,500 --> 02:50:16,040
So I haven't been able to give them notes.

2629
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:16,940
But yeah.

2630
02:50:17,720 --> 02:50:18,100
Yeah.

2631
02:50:18,180 --> 02:50:20,140
There's gonna be a lot of like toggles and everything.

2632
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:21,200
Yeah.

2633
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:21,880
Anyway.

2634
02:50:21,880 --> 02:50:23,400
I just want to show you guys this.

2635
02:50:23,620 --> 02:50:23,980
Wow.

2636
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:24,300
I was.

2637
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:26,040
I was wondering if I should keep it a surprise.

2638
02:50:26,180 --> 02:50:27,360
But then I might as well show it during.

2639
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:28,520
For Christmas.

2640
02:50:28,940 --> 02:50:29,620
As a little gift.

2641
02:50:29,880 --> 02:50:30,060
Gift.

2642
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:30,260
Like.

2643
02:50:30,340 --> 02:50:30,500
Look.

2644
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:30,720
Look.

2645
02:50:30,760 --> 02:50:31,040
Look.

2646
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:31,740
Look at this.

2647
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:35,000
I'm sorry.

2648
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:36,140
I don't really have a gift.

2649
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:37,260
Gift for you guys.

2650
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:39,420
This year.

2651
02:50:39,860 --> 02:50:41,840
There's a lot of things happening in the background though.

2652
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:44,980
So there will be some little gifts for you guys in the future.

2653
02:50:44,980 --> 02:50:45,720
For 2025.

2654
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:47,940
But thank you everybody.

2655
02:50:48,120 --> 02:50:49,060
I'm gonna call it here.

2656
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:50,280
As always everybody.

2657
02:50:50,500 --> 02:50:50,900
Stay hydrated.

2658
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:52,720
Posture check.

2659
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:53,840
Get up and move around.

2660
02:50:53,980 --> 02:50:54,960
To get that blood flowing.

2661
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:55,560
Any of you?

2662
02:50:55,660 --> 02:50:56,300
Still for me?

2663
02:50:56,640 --> 02:50:57,220
Head to bed.

2664
02:50:57,420 --> 02:50:57,720
Guys.

2665
02:50:57,940 --> 02:50:58,620
You deserve it.

2666
02:50:58,840 --> 02:50:59,100
I mean.

2667
02:50:59,260 --> 02:51:01,680
For those who watched my 10 hour fucking VOD of Marvel Rivals.

2668
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:02,060
You're way.

2669
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:03,500
You're so strong.

2670
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:04,420
And then right after.

2671
02:51:04,700 --> 02:51:06,060
A three hour karaoke.

2672
02:51:06,540 --> 02:51:07,240
Oh my god.

2673
02:51:07,280 --> 02:51:08,300
You're so strong.

2674
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:12,120
And thank you all for the Akasupas.

2675
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:14,440

02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:29,060
Bye bye everyone.
