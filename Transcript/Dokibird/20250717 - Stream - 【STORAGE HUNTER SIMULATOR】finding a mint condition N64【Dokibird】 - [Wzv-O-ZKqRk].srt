1
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,420
Oh, sorry.

2
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,660
Dad's mad because he wants food and I'm like, right now, my chicken wrap.

3
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,520
Sorry, not chicken wrap, it's a breakfast wrap.

4
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,100
I'm like, right now, I mean, aw.

5
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,460
Oh, yeah.

6
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,240
I'm all over the place right now because I was so hungry, but like, I have like, two more dishes.

7
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,420
Two more days of bad eating, as in like ordering.

8
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,040
No, no.

9
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,500
He's always such a hungry boy.

10
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,100
He's such a fucking hungry boy.

11
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,060
You know what I realized?

12
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,100
Yesterday, he was like barking a lot yesterday.

13
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,440
And I was so confused.

14
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,580
I was like, why are you barking?

15
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,020
Like, what's going on?

16
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:40,060
I realized he's been barking at me to give him his meds because he wanted his meds early.

17
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,040
And like, you're like, wow.

18
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,140
I can't believe dad is reminding you to feed him his meds.

19
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,440
No, it's because he gets two meds, two specific medication.

20
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,620
One is a syrup that he really likes because it's like a, it's like a thing.

21
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,520
I had to do a syringe for him.

22
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,340
And then, and then apparently, it's like a syrupy sweet taste.

23
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,680
So, every time I do the syringe, he like gets super excited.

24
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,880
He's like, yum, yum, yum, yum.

25
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,960
He's like, stick it in my mouth.

26
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:32,480
Om nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom liquid.

27
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,880
And then the thing about his like pills, I have to put the pills in the in a tree on top of a tree.

28
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,360
So he'll eat it because he doesn't like eat the pill itself.

29
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,700
But he knows he knows he's like, well, if you want to give me pills, I need a treat on top of it.

30
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,200
That's right.

31
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,040
You better give me don't hold out.

32
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,760
He's an addict.

33
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,320
Yeah.

34
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:06,340
So then I realized because I always give him his meds at 8pm around 8pm, but he's been like barking, barking at me to give it to him earlier.

35
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
So I did because I was like, is it because of the meds?

36
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,580
I was so confused.

37
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
And then because I was like, why are you barking at me?

38
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,640
Because he was like barking at me since like 6pm.

39
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,200
And I was so fucking confused because I was like, you already had dinner.

40
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,740
It's not walkies time.

41
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,480
So like, I know it's not that.

42
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,420
And then um, and I was like, I said the meds.

43
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,620
And then I gave him his like, I gave it an hour early.

44
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,400
And in a moment, he's like, guys meds.

45
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,460
He's like, He's like, okay, sleep time.

46
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,230
He's like, sorry, sleep time.

47
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,670
No, I didn't do the chat over there yet because I was getting food.

48
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,190
Getting my food.

49
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,610
No, he's like, I'm satisfied now.

50
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,290
So, yeah.

51
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,190
But, I have a few days left of eating terribly.

52
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,990
As in, like, eating, like, takeout for a few days.

53
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,490
Well, to be fair, yesterday I made spaghetti.

54
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,350
Yeah.

55
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,290
I bought, like...

56
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,890
Daiso Daiso.

57
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,950
So, like, I bought these, like...

58
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,550
I love Daiso because you can get, like, really cheap things.

59
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,370
Like, really cheap things made in Japan.

60
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,310
And they have, like, a food section area.

61
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,950
So, I bought, like, these packets.

62
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,070
Where it's, like, pasta sauce packets.

63
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,950
Um, like, Japanese packet sauce.

64
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,690
Uh, packet sauce.

65
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,170
Um, sauces.

66
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,690
And, like, I got, like, carbonara and, um, sesame oil.

67
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,190
And I got, like, um, some packets of, like, you know, carbonara sauces.

68
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,390
And, like, um, um, sesame oil and stuff.

69
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,350
And I decided, oh, you know, I want to try it out.

70
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:53,610
You know?

71
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,710
I had them for, like, a, like, a couple of months now.

72
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:58,890
Mmm.

73
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,970
So, I decided to try it out.

74
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,050
Japanese carbonara.

75
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,950
I'll say, like, for those who've never tried Japanese pasta.

76
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,470
The way...

77
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,790
It's so different.

78
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,590
It's really different from, like, um, American pasta.

79
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,430
There's just something about it.

80
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:14,850
I don't know.

81
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,630
Is it because...

82
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,070
I don't know.

83
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,110
Is it because it's sweet?

84
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:17,870
I can't...

85
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,330
I don't know.

86
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,270
There's just...

87
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,870
It's a different taste in general.

88
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,030
When you try to eat Japanese pasta versus, like, uh, it's just totally different.

89
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,590
Especially carbonara sauce.

90
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,710
Like, carbonara, like, American carbonara, it's, like, super...

91
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,010
I guess, like, um...

92
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,630
What's the word?

93
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,150
There's, like, bits and pieces on it and stuff like that.

94
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,390
Like, soggy and everything.

95
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,650
Like, there's a lot...

96
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,010
Um...

97
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,310
There's, like, a lot of, like...

98
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,690
I don't know what it's called.

99
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,650
But, like, it even looks different.

100
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,990
It's chunky.

101
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:50,390
Yes.

102
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,610
American carbonara.

103
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,870
It's, like, extra chunky and everything.

104
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,670
But, like, Japanese carbonara.

105
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,950
It's more...

106
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,630
Iggy.

107
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,150
It's, like, more...

108
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,470
Iggy.

109
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,310
I'll just say it like that.

110
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,710
Ha ha ha she ba .

111
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,090
And...

112
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,710
So, it's, like, a lot different.

113
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,610
The taste is different.

114
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,890
So, I was, like, oh...

115
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,130
I'll try it out.

116
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,770
So, I made, like, last night.

117
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,170
I made, like, creamy-smooth.

118
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,430
Yeah.

119
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,670
It's more creamy and smooth...

120
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,690
Compared to, like, chunky American carbonara.

121
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,050
Or Canadian.

122
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:24,970
I don't know, N A carbonara.

123
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,350
Like say American carbonara.

124
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,490
I'm, like, I'm Canadian.

125
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,010
But...

126
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,450
And we're, N A carbonara.

127
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,410
So, it's chunky versus creamy.

128
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,250
Yeah, but Alexander, please don't say chunky versus creamy.

129
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,890
I was like, oh, that's a great description.

130
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,930
But yeah, anyway, last night I made some Japanese carbonara last night with spam.

131
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,050
I know, great comment.

132
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,270
Very Asian.

133
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,810
I fucking love spam.

134
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:07,010
Anyway, so yeah, today I ordered from my favorite breakfast place where I got, like, a booster juice, my funky monkey.

135
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,130
It was a breakfast wrap, and it took so long for it to get here, so I'm sorry that I started streaming late, guys.

136
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,290
I'm just, I was really hungry, guys.

137
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:32,200
And I have, like, two more days of, like, eating my favorite comfort food before I have to try it.

138
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,180
Well, I mean, I'd say I'm a fucking being held hostage, but I know it's going to be really good for me health-wise.

139
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,720
I saw some of the food that, like, the pictures of some of the food, and it looks really good and healthy, too.

140
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:57,040
And, like, you know, I'll be starting to count my calories a bit better, because I've been so stressed out and eating very unhealthily the last, like, month or so because of how much stress I was having.

141
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:17,100
Um, but, starting in two days, I'm eating more healthy, um, because it's, like, I think it's, like, 1,600 calories a day, um, which is, like, um, which is, like, all right, because it's, like, the lower end in terms of, like, um, calorie counting.

142
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Um, but, like, I'm really excited, because, um, um, I don't know, the food looks really good.

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,480
The food looks really good.

144
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,320
It's, like, lunch.

145
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,940
Um, I think it's, I don't know if it's 1,600.

146
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,800
Maybe I'm, like, fucking making shit up.

147
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,280
I don't know.

148
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,860
I forgot.

149
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,320
Let me check, actually.

150
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:42,480
Because my particular meal plan, um, my particular meal plan is, like, the lower end of the calorie count.

151
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,060
Because I wanted to, like, focus more on health-wise.

152
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,700
Uh, so let me check, actually.

153
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,740
It is, actually, I don't, where is it?

154
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,940
Where is it?

155
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,920
I already ordered it, though, so I don't want to accidentally cancel it.

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,080
Like, I paid for it, so I'm worried I'll accidentally cancel it.

157
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,240
Um, and I can't say what I'm using, too, because then it'll dox me.

158
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,140
It is the low... Oh wait, it's... Oh, I shouldn't say it.

159
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,380
Sorry.

160
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm here not to read this out.

161
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Okay, but it is half the carbs, but more protein.

162
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,640
It's half the carbs though, so...

163
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,680
There is protein in there.

164
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,460
Um, and, uh, but it looks really good.

165
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,400
It looks really... I don't remember the actual...

166
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,900
I actually don't remember how many calories this is, because I can't see it.

167
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,740
I can't... it doesn't... I can't see it, guys.

168
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,140
It won't let me look at it anymore.

169
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,000
It had the thing.

170
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,060
It had it when I ordered it, because it was like, uh, what type of... how many calories would you like per day?

171
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,760
And I was like, this amount, because it gives you, like, various choices.

172
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,740
And I was like, this amount.

173
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,840
And they're like, okay, uh, we'll send this amount.

174
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,980
And I'm like, yippee!

175
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,140
Um, uh, but yeah, but, like, because I was like, 1600 is not a lot.

176
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,520
I was like, maybe it wasn't 1600.

177
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,820
I don't fucking know anymore.

178
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,960
Maybe, yeah, maybe, uh, maybe it wasn't.

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,600
I don't know.

180
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,680
I might be making shit up.

181
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,020
I just know it was at the... it was the lower end.

182
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,700
Um, because I was doing a calorie calculator counter thing.

183
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:50,940
Um, just to be like, oh, what do I do to make myself healthy to, like, starting to be more healthy for this last half of the year?

184
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,420
Um...

185
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,200
I figured it was a...

186
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,420
I figured it was a good step in the right direction.

187
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,120
Because I haven't been eating very healthily.

188
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,560
I mean, I'm...

189
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,580
The thing about me is that I try to eat healthy.

190
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,420
But, like, it...

191
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,860
Oh, 1600 is okay?

192
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,280
Okay, maybe it was 1600 then.

193
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,700
Yippee!

194
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,520
But, um...

195
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,100
Um, but anyway...

196
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,260
Uh, what was I gonna say?

197
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,620
Oh, yeah.

198
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,420
Like, I always try to eat healthy.

199
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,280
But it comes in fat...

200
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,240
Like, comes in waves.

201
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,460
So, like, I would at one point, I'll be like, Okay, I'm gonna start eating salad more.

202
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,960
And then, like, I just stop.

203
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,500
Because I have to order new groceries.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,020
And then, um...

205
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,920
And then I got...

206
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,680
I was like, I'm tired of salad.

207
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,160
I want to eat something else.

208
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,320
And then I start...

209
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,880
And then I'm like, you know, I'll just eat bread.

210
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,680
Bread and some free cheese with some deli meat.

211
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,900
And then I do that.

212
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,280
I was like, that's pretty healthy.

213
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,720
And then I do that.

214
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,180
And then I'm like, I'm tired of eating.

215
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,020
It's not fun.

216
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:58,400
And then I like, you know, I relapse into like ordering out because I'm like, I want to eat pasta.

217
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,140
I want to eat junk food.

218
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,080
I want pizza.

219
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:17,240
And I figured like, um, to resist the temptation of Uber Eats and ordering out, uh, I was like, I want to eat pasta.

220
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,040
I want sushi.

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,520
I don't want my sushi.

222
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't want to eat fucking salad.

223
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,420
Yeah, like, like, I just give up very easily.

224
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:48,980
So I would go into like, you know, like random, uh, months of like eating, like, I'll go like a month of eating healthy and then I give up and then I like, I do like one, like, I'll be like, okay, this is just gonna be a cheat day.

225
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,480
I'll just have a cheat day.

226
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,660
You know, like, it's just one day.

227
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:59,260
And then and then that one day turns into two days and then that and then three days and then three months pass.

228
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:14,120
And I'm like, oh, my, my, my, um, box of, uh, unopened box of spinach lies in my fridge for three months now.

229
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:28,800
I am like, actually, I wish I was joking, but I do have an unopened box of spinach in my refrigerator for at least like two months and I haven't done it away.

230
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,090
It's like judging me.

231
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,390
And then the worst part is there's a box of pizza underneath that box.

232
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,150
There's a, there's a pizza box underneath the fucking box of spinach.

233
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,590
Forever judging me and knowing what I did.

234
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,990
It sees me, it knows.

235
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:24,710
Anyway, so yeah, so I hope that by doing like a meal plan where every day they deliver me like, um, a prepared meal every day, um, that I would actually follow, follow in terms of like eating healthy again and not ordering out anymore.

236
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,370
Well, I won't say I won't order out anymore.

237
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:35,710
I feel like I will have like some cheat days, but I feel like it's a lot more healthier because like the meals are definitely a lot more, like there's more variation with the meals itself.

238
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,310
And, um, and, uh, you know, like, it's, it seems like they know what they're doing.

239
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,590
Like, it's like a, not a big, right?

240
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,010
Like, it's a big brand in Canada from what I've read about.

241
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,890
So it's like well known in Canada.

242
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,550
And like, uh, it's easier to stick to.

243
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,770
Yeah, it's easier routine to do it too.

244
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,370
Uh, so I'm hoping that, uh, that that will help me.

245
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,090
Um, thank you for the super chat.

246
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:02,390
Thank you.

247
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:02,810
Thank you.

248
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,350
Here's a tip from someone lost with Team House.

249
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,510
Keep a daily record to keep track of your health goals.

250
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,350
The start being healthy is hard, but it gets easier to longer stay on it.

251
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:09,850
You can do it.

252
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,530
Thank you for the super chat.

253
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,850
Thank you.

254
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,410
Thank you.

255
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,830
Fools, welcome to Team A The Fire.

256
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,190
Welcome.

257
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:13,670
Welcome.

258
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,490
Yeah.

259
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,790
Um, is that?

260
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,550
No, it's not because it's like well known in Canada.

261
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,810
Like the, from what I researched, it is a well known, it's in several provinces basically.

262
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,250
Like they do, they operate this in several provinces.

263
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,770
So it's not just in my province.

264
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,150
Um, uh, so it's not like a doxing thing.

265
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:41,850
Cause like I did research for one and like, like I said, I feel like I've been like very unhealthy for a while now in terms of like, um, just not eating very healthily.

266
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,530
Uh, which is not good in general.

267
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,010
Uh, because like I've been very tired lately.

268
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:52,590
Um, I've been trying to, but to be fair, I always like forget to do a routine with my vitamins and stuff.

269
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,110
So, uh, I haven't been like eating my vitamins as well.

270
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:04,550
And, uh, and, uh, you know, I've been like super like overworked in the, lately because of like all the stuff that was going on.

271
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,170
Um, but I'm much more like this month right now is much more relaxed now after my birthday stuff.

272
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,510
It's definitely much more relaxed.

273
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:19,230
And, um, I have a lot more, uh, I have a lot more, um, time to focus on myself and on myself now.

274
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:26,470
And, uh, and yeah, like recently in the last couple of days, I've been sleeping earlier and earlier.

275
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,330
And like, I, it's so hard for me to stay up.

276
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:39,030
So I feel like I just need to start, um, doing like baby steps in terms of, uh, uh, in terms of just like focusing on myself and my health now.

277
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,550
Uh, but yeah, I hope this, this is a good first step for me.

278
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,770
Uh, oh yeah.

279
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,250
Okay.

280
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,610
I've, this is that, I wanted to tell this story because I thought it was fucking hilarious.

281
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,930
Um, before we played a game, but, um,

282
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:05,010
anyway, so, um, so I got a text message from my old place.

283
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:12,850
I was very confused because I haven't been there for, I haven't lived there for, um, a year, uh, more than a year now.

284
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,070
And, um, they're like, pick up your package.

285
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,330
We received your package.

286
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,030
Can you please come over and pick it up?

287
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,390
I was so confused.

288
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,070
I was like, I don't have any, I didn't send any, I, I, I, all this stuff that was at my old place.

289
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,670
Um, for delivery, I picked it up.

290
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:35,650
I, there was only one time where I had something sent to my old place that I didn't, um, that forgot to forward to my new place.

291
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:43,330
And I picked that up like beginning of the year, but for some reason, um, something new was sent over.

292
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,550
So I was really confused.

293
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,210
I was like, why was there something new that was sent over?

294
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,190
Like, that's under my name.

295
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,310
So I went over and I picked up the package.

296
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,870
And I was like, yeah, I like moved out a long time ago.

297
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,230
I don't know why I had this package.

298
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,110
And I opened it up.

299
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,260
Okay.

300
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,380
Okay, I feel like if I say what it is, people will be like, what?

301
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,140
But I'll give some context.

302
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Before I say what it was.

303
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:35,560
So, um, but I realized when I opened it up, I was so confused.

304
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:43,200
Because I was like, I was like, I never ordered this.

305
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,200
I was like, why would I order this?

306
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,440
Okay.

307
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,780
So, before I say what the item was.

308
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,260
I, when I, I realized that I was so fucking confused.

309
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,520
And I was like, and then like realization came out.

310
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,820
Realization hit me as to how it came to be.

311
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,740
And I logged.

312
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,160
Okay.

313
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,220
Okay.

314
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,560
So, I forgot.

315
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,100
My throne account was still around.

316
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,580
All right.

317
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,740
Well, now that you know this context.

318
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
So, I opened it up.

319
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,880
And it was lingerie.

320
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,340
And then I checked my throne account.

321
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,180
Because I was like, this is the only thing I could think of.

322
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,760
And a fan.

323
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,960
I think.

324
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,920
I don't know.

325
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,740
A dragoon.

326
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,600
Sent in.

327
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,060
A surprise me gift.

328
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,380
And it was lingerie.

329
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,740
I was like, I checked my email.

330
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,920
I checked my email.

331
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,740
By the way, the last time this throne account was active was February, 2024.

332
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,600
So, somebody actively looked for my throne account.

333
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,120
Last, like, at the end of June.

334
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,020
This year.

335
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,280
June, 27th, 2025.

336
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,060
And when it made me lingerie.

337
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,940
I have an option on that account.

338
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,500
I have an option on that account.

339
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,800
Where the fans can buy me surprise gifts back then.

340
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,160
And then I checked the throne account.

341
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,760
And there it was.

342
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,640
Because you can reveal what the surprise gift is.

343
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,020
Because you can reveal it to yourself.

344
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,800
It won't be like actual surprise surprise.

345
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,840
Because there's an option for you to like click on it.

346
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,300
And it'll show you what they ordered.

347
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,100
And there it was.

348
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,720
And there it was.

349
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,200
The lingerie.

350
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,320
That's...

351
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,700
Yeah.

352
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,160
It's...

353
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,020
Oh, my God.

354
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,460
It's right there.

355
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,340
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

356
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:48,920
Thank you.

357
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,900
Thank you.

358
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,240
And I was just...

359
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,740
So, I was just like, what the fuck?

360
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,400
So, you can tell why I was so fucking confused.

361
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,740
When I...

362
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,620
When I...

363
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,200
When I received it.

364
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,200
When I...

365
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,280
By the way...

366
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,280
The lobby of my old place.

367
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,560
Because I did not think it was lingerie.

368
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,720
So, the fucking receptionist...

369
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,220
Saw me open it.

370
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,980
In front of him.

371
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,140
And I...

372
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,720
I was just like...

373
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,400
I...

374
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,460
I...

375
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:35,580
I...

376
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,560
Because I...

377
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,860
By the way I think...

378
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,980
Malathar, thank you for the super chat.

379
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,620
Thank you.

380
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,380
Thank you.

381
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,320
Quick, Dragon Spire.

382
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,700
Like, the thing is...

383
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,480
There was nothing in there.

384
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,440
Except for that.

385
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,520
So, like...

386
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:58,760
I...

387
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,100
I...

388
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,680
I was like, who sent this?

389
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,680
I was so confused.

390
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,380
Because it doesn't tell you it came from Throne.

391
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,540
It doesn't tell you.

392
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,380
Literally, you open the package.

393
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,800
And that's all there is.

394
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,680
It had zero context.

395
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,200
That's the word it was from.

396
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
So, I was so fucking confused.

397
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,340
And I was like, in my head, just being like...

398
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,540
Who fucking sent this to me?

399
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,340
Oh my god.

400
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,200
I...

401
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,460
But yes...

402
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,260
I...

403
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,340
That happened to me yesterday.

404
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,960
I was like...

405
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,800
I was like, oh my gosh.

406
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,420
I was like...

407
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Oh, I don't live there anywhere.

408
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,240
But I can come over.

409
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,120
Like, right now.

410
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,880
Let me pick it up.

411
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,720
And oh my...

412
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,180
This is...

413
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,360
I paid...

414
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,180
I paid $20 of Uber.

415
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,520
I paid $20 of Uber fees.

416
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,580
Go there and back to pick the package up.

417
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,020
So, who was it?

418
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,360
I demand my $20 back.

419
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,480
Bacon, thank you for the super chat.

420
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,480
Thank you.

421
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,600
Thank you.

422
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,420
I spent $20 of Uber fees to go there.

423
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,420
And back to...

424
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,180
All right.

425
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,080
So, that was...

426
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,720
My day...

427
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,080
Yesterday.

428
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,460
Kevin, thank you for the super chat.

429
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,020
Thank you.

430
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,760
Thank you.

431
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,920
A weird dragon does that for creepy reasons.

432
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,100
A cool dragon does that because they know you'll rant about it on stream.

433
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,800
And it will be funny.

434
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,720
Thank you for the super chat.

435
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,240
Thank you.

436
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:50,920
Thank you.

437
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,180
Well, thank you for the super chat.

438
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:54,680
Thank you.

439
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,260
Thank you.

440
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,840
Here's your Uber fee back.

441
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:58,820
Thank you.

442
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,220
Thank you for the reimbursement of my $20.

443
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,560
Michael, I love how the...

444
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,400
Thank you for the super chat.

445
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:06,660
Thank you.

446
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,120
Thank you.

447
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,720
I love how the first thing most dragons say is...

448
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,140
But did you wear it?

449
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,520
No.

450
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,300
Thank you for the super chat.

451
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,640
Thank you.

452
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,200
Thank you.

453
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,660
Chee, thank you for the super chat.

454
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,000
Thank you.

455
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,500
Thank you.

456
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,260
Thank you.

457
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,300
This is the reason you're eating healthy.

458
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,220
Push, thank you for the super chat.

459
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,060
Thank you, thank you.

460
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,880
He could be any of one of us.

461
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,740
He could be you.

462
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,280
He could even be me.

463
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,000
Pungun, thank you for the super chat.

464
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,820
Thank you, thank you.

465
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,560
It wasn't me, but this story was worth at least $20.

466
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,840
Thank you for the super chat.

467
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,920
Thank you, thank you.

468
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,820
Thank you.

469
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,560
Thank you for the super chat.

470
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:43,980
Thank you.

471
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,540
Thank you.

472
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,320
$20 for laundry sounds like a good deal.

473
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,700
Thank you for the super chat.

474
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,460
Thank you.

475
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,220
Thank you.

476
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,160
All right.

477
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,980
All right, guys.

478
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,920
George, thank you for the super chat.

479
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,360
Thank you.

480
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:01,980
Thank you.

481
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,240
Hope that bro do it again.

482
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,080
It looks nice.

483
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,140
Thank you for the super chat.

484
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,620
Thank you.

485
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,480
Thank you.

486
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,400
All right.

487
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,620
Let's play my Storage Wars.

488
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,640
Yes, we never expected the story on my Storage Wars... Storage Hunters Simulator.

489
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:19,580
Alright.

490
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,540
I didn't send it, but I'll give you 20 dollars to show us what... Oh, you can see it on my throne.

491
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,340
Don't...

492
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,360
It's there.

493
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,400
He can see it.

494
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,400
We'll never know who sent it because it's from anonymous.

495
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,860
But you can see it on the throne.

496
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,760
The exact item that was sent to me.

497
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,120
Let's see.

498
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,280
Thank you for the super chat.

499
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:50,900
Thank you.

500
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,820
Thank you.

501
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,080
Alright.

502
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,900
Someone found it.

503
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,180
Someone looked up the throne and instantly went, Jesus.

504
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900
It could be any one of us.

505
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,400
He might be here...

506
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,560
He or she might be here in this chat right now.

507
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,820
And he...

508
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,220
Knowing exactly what they did.

509
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,900
And they're recent, too.

510
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
Because apparently this was sent during...

511
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,220
There was a spot on the 27th of June.

512
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,400
Um...

513
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,640
Um...

514
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:29,780
Um...

515
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,920
Sajan, thank you for the super chat.

516
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,080
Super sticker.

517
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,580
Thank you.

518
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,140
Thank you.

519
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,100
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

520
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,640
Thank you.

521
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,420
Thank you.

522
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,140
Okay.

523
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,000
Put the black one or the white one.

524
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,540
No comment.

525
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,800
If you were the dragoon that bought it, you answered them.

526
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,320
You can answer it.

527
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,560
The dragoon that bought it.

528
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,100
Alright.

529
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,140
Only they know what color it was.

530
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,090
Alright.

531
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:13,810
Let's see.

532
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,910
Um...

533
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,170
For those who don't know...

534
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,190
Um...

535
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,380
For those who don't know...

536
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,230
The...

537
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,470
The...

538
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,510
What storage...

539
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:22,590
Uh...

540
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,730
What storage hunter is.

541
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,130
I think it's an American thing.

542
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,270
I don't know if they do this in any other country.

543
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,310
But like...

544
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,550
Uh...

545
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,650
People would buy like...

546
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,190
Storage areas to...

547
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,010
Place stuff.

548
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,090
Um...

549
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,370
Like...

550
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,910
Place like items that they couldn't...

551
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,170
Like if they're moving or something.

552
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,590
Or they're placing items.

553
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,130
Um...

554
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,610
Uh...

555
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,850
Extra items and stuff.

556
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,710
They store it there.

557
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,410
And if you don't pay...

558
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,530
If you don't pay the...

559
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:45,830
Uh...

560
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,210
Fees.

561
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,130
Um...

562
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,710
Each month.

563
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,250
Or like...

564
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:48,510
I don't know.

565
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,110
Each year.

566
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,430
To house your items.

567
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,410
They would put your storage...

568
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,370
Up for auction.

569
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,850
And then like...

570
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,690
We...

571
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,110
Are the people that would be...

572
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,790
Uh...

573
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:57,970
Yeah.

574
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,650
They're considered abandoned storages.

575
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,290
Cause you don't pay the fees...

576
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,070
Rent fees anymore.

577
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:02,810
Um...

578
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,370
You missed out on paying the rent fee.

579
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,690
And so...

580
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,290
They auctioned them out.

581
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,230
And then like...

582
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,190
We are the people that are trying to...

583
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,530
Buy...

584
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,170
Cause we don't know what's in those storages.

585
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,270
So they'll like...

586
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,690
Be like...

587
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,110
This is storage 576.

588
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,310
Um...

589
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,850
We'll start the bidding at like...

590
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,390
Five dollars.

591
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,090
Or some shit.

592
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,470
And then like...

593
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,230
And then like...

594
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,300
After you buy the storage...

595
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,630
They open it.

596
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:24,590
And like...

597
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,730
Let you see what you get.

598
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,330
Basically.

599
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,810
And then everything that's in there...

600
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,670
We get to keep.

601
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,430
It's like...

602
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,230
IRL gotcha.

603
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,810
But with people's belongings.

604
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,470
Alright.

605
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,450
Thank you for the super chat.

606
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:35,830
Thank you.

607
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,310
Thank you.

608
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,390
Do we get to...

609
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,130
Drive me if you want.

610
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,830
I won't stop you.

611
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,150
It's a free country.

612
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:44,790
Yeah.

613
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,530
It's like a...

614
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:45,990
IRL...

615
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,950
The original...

616
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,290
Gotcha.

617
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:47,930
Yeah.

618
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,130
IRL loot boxes.

619
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,150
Alright.

620
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,150
Uh...

621
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:54,810
Moderate risk.

622
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,070
Ooh.

623
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,710
Let's do it.

624
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,670
We love a good risk.

625
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,870
Alright.

626
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,550
Let's be...

627
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,730
Alright.

628
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,850
Who do we wanna be?

629
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:07,810
Alright.

630
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:08,870
Let's look like...

631
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,160
Moody plumbers.

632
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,430
Hahaha.

633
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,210
Alright.

634
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,310
Let's be a dragon.

635
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,270
Wait.

636
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,870
We don't have a yellow skin color.

637
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:20,330
Okay.

638
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:20,930
Nevermind.

639
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:21,430
Okay.

640
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,090
This is...

641
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,610
This is...

642
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,770
Jeff Bezos.

643
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,890
Hahaha.

644
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,310
I guess we just...

645
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,910
We're just Jeff Bezos now.

646
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,350
Isn't this his current?

647
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,150
No.

648
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:33,530
He's...

649
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,870
He's beardless at the moment.

650
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:36,870
Alright.

651
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,270
We're Jeff Bezos.

652
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,790
Don't worry.

653
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,150
We're gonna make it big.

654
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:45,830
Before...

655
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,610
Before Amazon.

656
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,170
We were...

657
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,530
We were storage hunters.

658
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:50,990
Alright.

659
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,350
Summer event.

660
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,010
Whoa.

661
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,210
Oh my god.

662
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,810
There's exclusive summer outfits.

663
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:57,370
Guys.

664
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,950
Oh my...

665
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,210
Oh my god.

666
00:33:59,290 --> 00:33:59,870
I can build...

667
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,090
No.

668
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,690
Don't put me back in Scandinavia.

669
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,210
I don't wanna build my own car again.

670
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,210
I...

671
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,490
Please.

672
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,030
Not again.

673
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,370
I can't go back to Scandinavia.

674
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,210
I...

675
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,910
Uh...

676
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,190
Uh...

677
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,450
Oh...

678
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:19,590
Hosni.

679
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,690
Thank you for the super chat.

680
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:20,990
Thank you.

681
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,430
Thank you.

682
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,310
Not to nitpick.

683
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,550
But aren't gifts from that throne account technically supposed to be for dad?

684
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,450
I don't know if he could fit...

685
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,070
With the laundry.

686
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:30,770
Guys.

687
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:31,630
I...

688
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,310
Hahahaha.

689
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,350
Thank you for the super chat.

690
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:35,810
Thank you.

691
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,630
Thank you.

692
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,010
Alright.

693
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,290
Let's see.

694
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,490
Alright, how do I... Press tab to open or close your tablet.

695
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,710
Open your tablet and sign up for the auctions in Blueberry.

696
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,790
Oh, right?

697
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:52,690
Auctions.

698
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,290
Oh, okay.

699
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,810
I have to go to Village People, opening price.

700
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:57,890
Alright, nice.

701
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,090
Take the car, enter, drive, and win my first.

702
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,750
That's right.

703
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,510
We're gonna make it big!

704
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,250
I have one vehicle taking out at a time.

705
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,130
Alright, let's go.

706
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:08,890
Yeah.

707
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:09,890
Aw, man.

708
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:17,710
Guys, I might not be rich now, but just you see, I'm gonna win... I'm gonna win the biggest auction of my life.

709
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,710
Yeah.

710
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,250
A big one.

711
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,230
And then you'll all regret making fun of me in high school.

712
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,350
Okay.

713
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,550
Where the fuck is the auction?

714
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,710
Oh, let's turn down this whimsical storage music.

715
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,850
Okay.

716
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,290
Let's turn this down.

717
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,490
Alright.

718
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,230
My copyright-free music right there.

719
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,430
We'll gamble it all.

720
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,010
The first garage, the first storage unit is always the best one.

721
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,490
Oh, wait.

722
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,090
How the fuck did I get there?

723
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,070
We're off-road, baby.

724
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,870
Yeah, where we're going, we don't need no roads.

725
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,010
Off-road time.

726
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,350
But I'm on-road.

727
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,730
Alright, I'm here now.

728
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,010
Alright, I'm ready.

729
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,270
Use the W and S key to select the amount.

730
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,530
To bid, press the E key.

731
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,390
Hold it down.

732
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,470
Alright, where's the auction?

733
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:33,990
Alright.

734
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,570
Sign me up.

735
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,390
Please be on time.

736
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:38,990
I'm ready.

737
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,170
Where is it?

738
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,570
I'm ready to win my first auction.

739
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,030
Oh, it's over there.

740
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,550
And then I'm going to get my mid-conditioned N64.

741
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,180
Here I go.

742
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,720
You're all going to regret it.

743
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,480
You're not getting this beautiful store.

744
00:36:59,560 --> 00:36:59,680
Oh, yeah.

745
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,380
You get like...

746
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,700
Okay, that's...

747
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,380
Okay.

748
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,960
Wait, this is... This is not how it's done in Storage Wars.

749
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,960
Storage Wars?

750
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,240
Why am I able to see... Oh, but there's a chest right there.

751
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,560
Wait, there's a chest.

752
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,000
Wait, that might be good.

753
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,640
Yeah.

754
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,160
Yeah.

755
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,820
Give me that chest.

756
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,660
There's a chest right there.

757
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,500
It could be... There could be actual treasure.

758
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,100
Oh, really?

759
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,360
Don't worry, I can afford it.

760
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,820
That's right.

761
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,940
Going once.

762
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,960
I did it!

763
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,520
I won!

764
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:47,890
No!

765
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,090
Alright, what did I get?

766
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,530
Hold down on the...

767
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,810
You want to verify.

768
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,390
Instant cell?

769
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,550
Gym steps?

770
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,190
Oh, verify this.

771
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,230
What is this?

772
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:04,970
Verify.

773
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,870
I need level 2 verification!

774
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:09,910
Oh my god.

775
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,250
Oh, this is...

776
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,530
Okay.

777
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,470
What the fuck do I do?

778
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,310
I have to visit the locksmith?

779
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,590
Alright, let's just...

780
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,510
Verify this right now.

781
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,210
Okay.

782
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,610
That's fine.

783
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,410
We can fix it.

784
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,050
I need a fixing tool of level 2.

785
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,150
Okay, we sell this.

786
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,310
That's 4 dollars.

787
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,050
That's 2 dollars.

788
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,250
That's 1 dollar.

789
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,550
Alright, let's verify this.

790
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,330
This seems rare.

791
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,450
Okay, 65 dollars.

792
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,150
Okay.

793
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,890
I need verification.

794
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,330
What about this?

795
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:44,950
12 dollars?

796
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:45,890
Oh my god.

797
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,550
How do I get a...

798
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:47,870
Okay.

799
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,270
Oh.

800
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,550
Pack items.

801
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,790
Okay.

802
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,850
Okay, we're gonna...

803
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,010
Okay.

804
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,230
We can...

805
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,310
We can salvage this.

806
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,430
I'm gonna...

807
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,310
I'll fix you.

808
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,690
I will fix you.

809
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,490
I'll make you better.

810
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,990
Don't worry.

811
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,410
I can fix you.

812
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,370
How do I...

813
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,050
Okay, wait.

814
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,150
Okay, we gotta be able to pack this up.

815
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,530
Don't worry.

816
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,890
I'll fix you.

817
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,370
I'll fix this rusty ladder.

818
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,030
You can unrust anything.

819
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,810
Okay, wait.

820
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,450
What's this?

821
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,810
What is this little shit?

822
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,850
Why is it all broken?

823
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,550
Wait, this is...

824
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,750
This isn't even broken.

825
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,050
Where are you?

826
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:38,150
No.

827
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,830
Okay.

828
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,450
We have...

829
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,650
Two dollar profit.

830
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,250
Let's go.

831
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,150
Look at that.

832
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,130
See, a profit...

833
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,670
Profit is profit, guys.

834
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,390
Profit is profit.

835
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,690
Alright, let's bring you over to the pawn shop.

836
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,510
Jedi storage.

837
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,070
For each other.

838
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,870
Oh my god.

839
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:02,670
Don't worry.

840
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,870
Eventually, I'll have like a thing that can help me and move things faster.

841
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,950
We gotta sell this, though.

842
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,970
Oh my...

843
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:10,370
Look at that.

844
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,130
Ten dollar profit right there.

845
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:12,490
It's...

846
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,530
That's almost ten dollars.

847
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:14,310
Okay.

848
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,890
I can fix you.

849
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,530
I can fix you.

850
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,110
Don't worry.

851
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,170
No, no, no, no, no.

852
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:21,830
No, no, no, no.

853
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,730
I get my gas all natural.

854
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,690
I don't pay for gas.

855
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,210
Ha ha ha ha.

856
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,190
Uh...

857
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,710
Juan George, thank you for the super chat.

858
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,070
Thank you.

859
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:35,650
Thank you.

860
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,750
I used to have one storage space and I was too lazy to clean it when I moved.

861
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,710
So the storage guy just telling me to leave it and they can auction.

862
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,150
P.S.

863
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,670
It's full of my old techs for that stuff.

864
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:47,970
Wait a minute.

865
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,010
That sounds like a scam.

866
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,590
Ha ha ha ha.

867
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,510
You have rare items verified each expert and is responsible for verif...

868
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:58,750
Okay.

869
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,690
All right, we just got...

870
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,590
Wait.

871
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,590
Wait a minute.

872
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,210
You knew what was inside that storage.

873
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,010
Ha ha ha ha.

874
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,170
Ha ha ha ha.

875
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,430
You knew exactly what was inside that storage.

876
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,790
That poor guy that won textbooks.

877
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,470
Ha ha ha ha.

878
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,850
Okay guys, I played Tetris.

879
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,350
And it all fits.

880
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,350
Oh my god.

881
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,290
Okay, we'll just leave this here for now.

882
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,730
I'll come back for you.

883
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,290
I'll come back for you.

884
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,870
This is like the 600...

885
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,230
665 dollars one.

886
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,870
Okay, so we gotta...

887
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,170
No!

888
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,010
Oh wait, that's fine.

889
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:42,770
Wait, what's that?

890
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,210
Did I steal this?

891
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,310
Oh no, it's okay.

892
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,410
You didn't see.

893
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,350
There was no cameras.

894
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:48,690
You don't know.

895
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:49,750
No one knows.

896
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,950
No one knows.

897
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,190
Don't...

898
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,850
They won't know.

899
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,470
No one will know.

900
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,070
All right.

901
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,430
So we gotta go find someone that can unlock...

902
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,190
Okay, that's for cars.

903
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,010
Okay, that's the locksmith over there.

904
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,830
But I'll go to the locksmith.

905
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,030
All right.

906
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,130
This could be something very special.

907
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,870
All right.

908
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,970
What's in this?

909
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,950
Select item.

910
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,170
Okay, it's only a...

911
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:26,910
It's fine.

912
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,930
It's only 20 dollars.

913
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,610
There could be a treasure map in there.

914
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,350
There could be an N64.

915
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,810
You don't know that.

916
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,590
Oh my god, I could buy a gun.

917
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,130
Okay, wait.

918
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,630
I need to find a place to buy my fixing tool.

919
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,150
Rifle, swords, and clothes.

920
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,330
Buy, sell, trade.

921
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,570
It could be my Pokemon cards.

922
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:52,830
Guys.

923
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,110
I'll be one of those people that have no idea what Pokemans are.

924
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,050
But I'm here to scalp them.

925
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,490
Where is?

926
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,650
Oh, so how's the music now?

927
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:06,950
Sound guy.

928
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,370
Okay, local pawn shop.

929
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,050
For real.

930
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:22,870
There's like, scalpers that, like, clearly don't know anything about, like, Pokemans, but they're all buying up all the fucking Pokeman cards.

931
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,870
That's me.

932
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,510
That's going to be me.

933
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,730
That's right.

934
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,750
I'm going to Walmart.

935
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,310
And I'm going to Walmart while they're stocking up those Pokeman cards.

936
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,790
And buying them all.

937
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,090
Alright.

938
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,390
Assist quality is bad.

939
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,250
Quest complete.

940
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,170
Okay, we'll sell these and then I'll fix the gym step later.

941
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,370
You can sell verified items at the pawn shop.

942
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:51,790
Okay.

943
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:53,650
Alright.

944
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,290
What is this?

945
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,510
Don't worry, I'll fix you.

946
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,710
You don't know what's good.

947
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,990
Think about the children.

948
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,410
Think about my paycheck.

949
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,610
Alright, let's go back.

950
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,370
I need to go back.

951
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,690
People still scalping.

952
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,130
Yeah, I was so surprised that Pokemon cards...

953
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:20,590
Sorry, I got into the bit too real.

954
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:21,410
It got too real.

955
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,390
I was so surprised that, like, Pokemon cards got, like, became a thing again.

956
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,130
Like, the scalping of Pokemon.

957
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,410
But, like, it got worse.

958
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:39,030
Because I remember when, like, Logan Paul did that whole, like, like, um, unboxing shit.

959
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,850
And that, like, set off, like, a huge fucking trend of Pokemon cards unboxing.

960
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,670
And prices started surging.

961
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,770
And then, like, I was so surprised it, like, happened again.

962
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,210
I don't even know what triggered it.

963
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,430
Oh, it was, like, the Evolution card packs that triggered it or something.

964
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:00,330
Yeah, it, like, things went even crazier.

965
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,590
Because you would think that things were, like, crazy during the COVID times.

966
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,630
Because, like, people couldn't, like, had nothing else to do.

967
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,950
So they were just, like, opening Pokemon packs.

968
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,310
But now it's, like, even worse now.

969
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,910
Can I buy a gun?

970
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,660
Wait, this is...

971
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,520
Oh, fuck it.

972
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,480
I'll just sell it for now.

973
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,620
Fuck it.

974
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,760
I have a good rep now.

975
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
Can I buy anything else?

976
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,920
No, okay.

977
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,500
That's not a gun.

978
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,480
Yeah, same with Magic cards.

979
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,260
I don't even know.

980
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,080
I don't even know what trick...

981
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,220
Do you guys know what triggered, like, the second coming of scalping?

982
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,380
I think it's funny that American cards are worth more than the Japanese cards, too.

983
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,000
The second coming of...

984
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,220
Captain, thank you for the super chat.

985
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,120
Thank you, thank you.

986
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:08,480
As someone currently into Magic right now, it's becoming a nightmare with this Final Fantasy wave.

987
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,800
Where it's pretty much the Pokemon people buying out the stores.

988
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,400
Yeah, because you see the money.

989
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:18,080
They're like, oh, if I can do that on Pokemans, I can do that on the Magic, the Gathering cards.

990
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,020
What do I do?

991
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,160
I need to earn money?

992
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,460
I sold everything.

993
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,120
Oh, the guy with the...

994
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,660
The guy that was unlocking my chest.

995
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,860
Alright.

996
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,900
Similar with, like, Garage Hunters.

997
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,840
The people who, like, hunt garage sales for, like...

998
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,840
For, like, rare finds and stuff like that.

999
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,940
I had, like, some of those shorts recommended on my YouTube feed.

1000
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,280
And I swear to God, they all sound like fucking pretentious assholes.

1001
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,080
Like...

1002
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,840
I hate watch them.

1003
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:54,720
Um...

1004
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,840
Whenever their shorts come up, I hate watch it.

1005
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,940
And I'm part of the problem.

1006
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:58,800
I'm...

1007
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,120
I'm...

1008
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,300
I'm...

1009
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:00,360
I'm...

1010
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,220
I'm part of the problem.

1011
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,180
Uh...

1012
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,940
They are...

1013
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,320
They're...

1014
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,020
The comment section is filled with people calling them assholes for doing it.

1015
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,240
And being like...

1016
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,100
Yeah, I'm glad the garage sale people...

1017
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,400
Um...

1018
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,200
Aren't...

1019
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,680
Uh...

1020
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,000
Aren't selling you the stuff that you want.

1021
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,220
But then, like, we're all enabling them.

1022
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,000
We're all...

1023
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,260
We're all...

1024
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,180
We're all enablers.

1025
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:30,330
Hello?

1026
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,110
Just let me be part of the bid!

1027
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:34,450
Oh, I have a map.

1028
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,410
Okay.

1029
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:36,930
What is this, anyway?

1030
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:37,990
What's the legend?

1031
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,170
Uh...

1032
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:42,170
Okay, that's the pawn shop.

1033
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:43,670
The mo...

1034
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,510
Oh, this is where I build my car.

1035
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,850
I guess that's for gas.

1036
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:48,690
There's a locksmith.

1037
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:49,990
What the fuck is that?

1038
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,090
Uh...

1039
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:51,570
Preppers?

1040
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:52,870
What, for my...

1041
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,970
Mine detector?

1042
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,290
Oh, who's fucking putting out mines?

1043
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:57,490
Wait.

1044
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,250
New auction tiers.

1045
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,570
New auction tier and pawn shop.

1046
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,950
How do I fix my stuff later, though?

1047
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,450
I wanna fix my things.

1048
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:07,870
Uh...

1049
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:08,130
Oops.

1050
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,750
Oh my god.

1051
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,650
There's even, like, a little legend thing here.

1052
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:12,430
Uh...

1053
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,870
Blueberry pawn shop.

1054
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,450
Oh, I can buy it.

1055
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:17,530
And then I'll be part...

1056
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,590
And then I can...

1057
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:19,870
Um...

1058
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,290
And then I can be part of the system.

1059
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:26,530
Artemis!

1060
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:27,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1061
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:28,630
Thank you, thank you.

1062
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,930
Oh, the green spot to the left?

1063
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,250
What green spot to the left?

1064
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,510
Where is it?

1065
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:38,690
Oh my god.

1066
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:39,390
There's more?

1067
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:39,950
Oh my god.

1068
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:40,710
That's the city!

1069
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:42,390
Oh!

1070
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,770
There's so much more.

1071
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,270
Toys that make noise.

1072
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,230
What am I gonna do with that?

1073
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:49,890
Oh, shit.

1074
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:50,450
Oh my god.

1075
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,070
I'm gonna be late.

1076
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,250
Hello?

1077
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:56,690
Where's my auction?

1078
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:57,230
I saw...

1079
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:57,330
Oh!

1080
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:57,730
Oh!

1081
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:58,690
I have to stand there!

1082
00:48:58,990 --> 00:48:59,350
Oh, wait!

1083
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:00,430
Don't start the auction!

1084
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:03,950
Alright.

1085
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:07,070
There's a sink.

1086
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:08,090
Okay.

1087
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,410
That has to be worth a lot.

1088
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,390
It might be rusted.

1089
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:11,230
But I think...

1090
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,010
I think that...

1091
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,310
That stove right there?

1092
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,850
That has to be a lot of money.

1093
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,550
I'm gonna bid it.

1094
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:17,530
I'm gonna win it.

1095
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,430
That's right.

1096
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,530
Get me in there!

1097
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:25,990
That's...

1098
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,350
Get out of here, Gabriel!

1099
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:31,850
I bet there's an N64 located underneath that stove!

1100
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,550
That's right!

1101
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,550
It's not junk!

1102
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,890
I can fix it!

1103
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,670
Get me in there!

1104
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,990
I can smell the N64 underneath that sink!

1105
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,070
That's the holy grail!

1106
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,190
Watch this!

1107
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:00,650
Okay.

1108
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,650
Watch this!

1109
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:02,810
Oh!

1110
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,490
I told you!

1111
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,290
It's the holy grail!

1112
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,630
I knew it!

1113
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,230
Oh my god!

1114
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,290
And I got a...

1115
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:13,030
Oh my god!

1116
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,270
You guys didn't see it!

1117
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,210
But there was a chest here!

1118
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,110
Look at that!

1119
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,530
Oh my god!

1120
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,770
My labubu!

1121
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,130
Oh my god!

1122
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,230
I got labubu!

1123
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,430
You all laughed at me!

1124
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,410
But look who's laughing now!

1125
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,770
I got a fucking labubu!

1126
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,810
I got a birdcage too!

1127
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,250
The fuck do I fix all these stuff?

1128
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:40,530
Okay.

1129
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,330
Wait, that's actually a lot of shit.

1130
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,370
My rare labubu!

1131
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,910
My rare labubu!

1132
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,430
That...

1133
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:50,310
Don't die!

1134
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,090
My 24th care labubu!

1135
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:55,430
That's right!

1136
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,950
It's not a lafufu!

1137
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,190
It's a labubu!

1138
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,210
Already got my money back!

1139
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,150
Look at that!

1140
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,130
I already got it back!

1141
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,610
And I got a rare ass chest too!

1142
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,710
It looks...

1143
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,970
I got myself some profit!

1144
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,850
You all laughed at me!

1145
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,590
You were like, Stop Doki!

1146
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,690
Stop!

1147
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,610
And I knew...

1148
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:18,690
Never quit!

1149
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,030
Winners don't quit!

1150
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,010
Jeff Bezos never quit!

1151
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,290
Alright!

1152
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,430
Gotta make sure I get my labubu!

1153
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,490
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1154
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,610
Ha ha ha ha!

1155
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,150
Ha ha ha ha!

1156
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,470
You gotta make sure!

1157
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,510
Gotta stay there!

1158
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,820
Alright!

1159
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,380
What's this?

1160
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,780
Okay, I gotta sell this!

1161
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,620
I'm using the force!

1162
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:44,860
I'm using the force!

1163
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,000
Maybe I'm Voldemort instead!

1164
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,040
This is what happens after...

1165
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,720
After the franchise died!

1166
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,540
Ha ha ha ha!

1167
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,140
After the franchise died, I got it!

1168
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,300
Voldemort had to make ends meet!

1169
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,340
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1170
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,160
Ha ha ha ha!

1171
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:04,920
Ha ha ha ha!

1172
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,880
I'm a wizard!

1173
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,260
I'm a what?

1174
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:08,700
Alright!

1175
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,040
Jeff is Voldemort!

1176
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,080
Ha ha ha ha!

1177
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,400
Ha ha ha ha!

1178
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:13,940
Ooh!

1179
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,040
Ooh!

1180
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:15,440
Ooh!

1181
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,300
I didn't say that!

1182
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,500
He he he he!

1183
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,380
Alright!

1184
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,160
I bet you...

1185
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,980
My...

1186
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,600
I'll need to get my Holy Grail!

1187
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,420
One day!

1188
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,080
One day!

1189
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,700
I'll have the Holy Grail!

1190
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,220
The N64!

1191
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,580
Alright!

1192
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,460
Here I go!

1193
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,020
Here I go!

1194
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:36,780
See...

1195
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,080
Okay!

1196
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,660
I can't...

1197
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,180
I'll pick these up later!

1198
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,760
I have too much stuff on my van right now!

1199
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,860
Pick it up later!

1200
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,500
I'll go and sell this!

1201
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,980
And make my thousand dollars!

1202
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,760
No one steal my shit!

1203
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,640
I don't know!

1204
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,240
Okay!

1205
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:52,900
Yeah!

1206
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,380
It's been tough for...

1207
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,580
For...

1208
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,540
The wizard who can't be named!

1209
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,440
Oh my god!

1210
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:00,880
Okay!

1211
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,700
Ha ha ha ha!

1212
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,270
I saw a really...

1213
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,160
I saw a really fucked up tweet!

1214
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,000
Um...

1215
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,120
Um...

1216
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,120
A couple of days ago!

1217
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,660
Um...

1218
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,490
About the...

1219
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,640
I did not realize...

1220
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,320
That...

1221
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,580
Irish people exploding...

1222
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,980
Is a very...

1223
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,160
Is an actual stereotype...

1224
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,920
About Irish people!

1225
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,680
I was not aware!

1226
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:25,860
Ha ha ha!

1227
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:26,740
Ha ha ha!

1228
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,140
Ha ha ha!

1229
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,640
Ha ha ha!

1230
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,220
I was like...

1231
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,960
What the fuck?

1232
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,920
That's a thing?

1233
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,480
Ha ha ha!

1234
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,300
Ha ha ha!

1235
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:34,960
What?

1236
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,700
I did not know...

1237
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,080
About that!

1238
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,280
Ha ha ha!

1239
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,280
Yeah!

1240
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:42,380
Yeah!

1241
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,820
I was like...

1242
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,100
What?

1243
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,260
That's a stereotype?

1244
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,300
I did not know!

1245
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:49,940
I was learn...

1246
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,120
I learned about...

1247
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,420
History!

1248
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,580
Oh my god!

1249
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,200
I was so surprised!

1250
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,480
Ha ha ha!

1251
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,540
I was like...

1252
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,240
Holy shit!

1253
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,140
That's fucked up!

1254
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,040
All right!

1255
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,040
Let's put this stove...

1256
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,720
It's Tetris time!

1257
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,960
Do do do do, do do do do!

1258
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,620
Do do do do do!

1259
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,700
Do do do!

1260
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,340
Do do do do!

1261
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:16,380
Do do do do!

1262
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,020
Okay!

1263
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:17,600
That's...

1264
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:17,760
Okay!

1265
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,280
Nevermind!

1266
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,400
It's not Tetris time!

1267
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,560
It's just one item!

1268
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,560
It's just...

1269
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
It's just one!

1270
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,480
All right, it's just one item.

1271
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,420
My beautiful Tetris of one item.

1272
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:37,760
Here we go.

1273
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:38,920
Oh, shit.

1274
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:39,700
It's fine.

1275
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,440
Do I need gas?

1276
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,320
Oh, shit!

1277
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,280
Okay, it's okay.

1278
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,780
I can afford gas soon.

1279
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:44,780
Don't worry.

1280
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:44,820
Okay.

1281
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,170
All right, here we go.

1282
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,630
All right, nice.

1283
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,230
We're gonna make it back.

1285
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:03,850

00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,470
Okay, now we Tetris.

00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,330
Oh, shit.

00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:14,590
I'm almost back.

1289
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:15,250
Don't worry.

1290
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,150
I know there's an N64 in that chest.

1291
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,670
Eventually, I'll get my Grail.

1292
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:25,390
I'll get it eventually.

1293
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:31,430
Also, did you guys know that thrift shops are, like, for-profit?

1294
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,530
You think, like...

1295
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:40,330
You think, like, thrift shops are, like, you know, doing stuff for, like, charity-wise?

But, like, thrift stores are, what are, is owned by a fucking million dollar doctor.

1297
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:53,630
By a million, a doctor who's a millionaire.

1298
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,030
It's all for profit.

1299
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:56,710
Yeah.

1300
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,950
I didn't realize that.

1301
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,490
It's, like, people were, like...

1302
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:07,790
People...

1303
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:12,710

It's crea- Like, there was a chair or couch or something.

1306
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:22,350
Like, somebody donated a $50,000 couch to a thrift store.

1307
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:26,890
And this lady was, like, uh, talking about this- the item itself.

1308
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,790
And was like, yeah, this is a- Oh, wait.

1309
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,290
I got- I got a journal.

1310
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,150
Oh, I'm almost there.

1311
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:33,650
Wait.

1312
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,110

00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:44,590
And then, the lady was talking about the- the chest- uh, sorry, not chest.

1317
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:49,870
The, uh, the couch that- the $50,000 couch that someone donated to a thrift store.

1318
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:55,010
And then the- the thrift store was selling it for, like, nine- like, $10,000.

1319
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:00,070
But, like, they pocket that entire- like, they pocket it, basically.

1320
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:03,230
Like, they get to keep all the money from that cell.

1321
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,490
Which is fucking crazy to think about.

1322
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:09,110
Wait, what was in it?

1323
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,870
Where's my chest?

1324
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,450
Oh, it's over here.

1335
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,270
I can't open it.

1336
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:35,610
Wait, what?

1337
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,150

Okay, that- okay.

Ooh, god, necklace!

1345
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:51,250
That has to be- Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

1346
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,470
I can't even verify... Can I sell the chest?

1347
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,390
Can I...

1348
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,510
What do you mean I need a verification tool number two?

1349
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:02,830
What the fuck am I gonna do with this?

1350
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:08,830
Alright, at least I paid back the... I paid the opening for that chest from my fishing rod.

1351
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:09,890
Alright.

1352
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:19,470
What the fuck am I gonna do with like... with like this... this chest?

00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,190
Thank you, thank you!

00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,210
Hello, everybody!

1357
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:30,150
Hello, hello!

1358
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:32,490
Alright, let's go to the pond store.

1359
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,230
Alright, we gotta sell that chest tool.

1360
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:37,330
I'll put it up on eBay.

1361
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,010
Someone will want it.

1362
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:42,990
Okay, we'll sell the fishing rod first.

1363
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,930
I don't know what it's in here.

1364
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,870
I gotta keep this chest.

1365
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,310
I don't know what the fuck is in my chest.

1366
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,670
Get out!

1367
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,330
Get out!

1368
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,330
I'm a business owner!

1369
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,290
I'm a future millionaire.

1370
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,990
You don't wanna make me angry.

1371
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,170
Alright, let's go do one more auction.

1372
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,410
Uh, this way.

Alright.

1375
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:12,250
We gotta go this way.

Alright, it's...

1378
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:28,370
I don't know how I... I forgot how to get to like the only source of income for me.

1379
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:33,030
I think it's this way, and then there should be one more storage that I can bid on.

1380
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,290
That's right.

1381
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,270
I'm here for the last auction.

1382
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,050
Oh fuck.

1383
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:41,950
Never mind.

1384
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,030

1385
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,140

1386
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,290
I'm $200 short for my rent!

1387
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:55,130
You can't do this to me!

1388
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:57,470
Okay, where do I live?

1389
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,830
Wait, where is my house?

1390
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,410
Is this where I live?

1391
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,810
Oh, I can sell it.

Wait, did I say a week?

1402
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,730
$200 a week?

1403
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:20,050
I'm not made of money!

The troubles sounded like...

1426
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:07,450
Not so troubling.

1427
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:08,570

That's right!

01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,070
That's a threat!

1438
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:35,270
Don't make me start scalping the Pokemans!

1439

It's crazy how they just recently blew up!

1450

When were they a thing?

1454
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:11,230
Cause I used to be like...

1455
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:11,350
A...

1456
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,310
Yeah, it started in...

1457
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:14,110
2019!

1458
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,930
So I've seen them around since 2019!

1459
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:19,330
And...

1460
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:19,810
Like...

1461
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:22,270
They only recently became super popular...

1462
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:23,130
This year!

1463
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,150
Uh...

1464
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,910
Because some...

1465
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:27,250
Apparently a K-pop celebrity...

1466
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,930
Was seen wearing them!

1467
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:30,930
So the K-pop fandom...

1468
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:32,130
Blew up with it!

1469
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,330
Blew up about it!

1470
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:34,930
And then it traveled everywhere...

1471
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,430
Around the world...

1472
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:36,910
Because of it!

1473
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,050
But it was already popular...

1474
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,370
In Asia for like...

1475
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:40,950
A while!

1476
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,350
But not that popular!

1477
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:43,310
Uh...

1478
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:43,910
And Popmart...

1479
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:44,930
Popmart is actually...

1480
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,290
I think like...

1481
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,130
Popmart...

1482
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,370
Popmart is like...

1483
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:49,510
Cause the Booboo is actually from...

1484
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,690
A Hong Kong designer!

1485
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:52,670
Um...

1486
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,090
And Popmart...

1487
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:54,950
I don't know if it's like...

1488
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:55,910
Ch...

1489
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:56,530
It's Chinese!

1490
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:57,010
Yeah!

1491
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,290
Popmart has been like...

1492
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,550
A well-known...

1493
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:00,770
Chinese...

1494
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:01,330
Uh...

1495
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,070
Figure company since...

1496
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:03,630
2010!

1497
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,150
So I've known about...

1498
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,830
Popmart for the longest time!

1499
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,810
And I actually have a couple of...

1500
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:09,610
Popmart figures!

1501
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,090
Um...

1502
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,010
When they do like...

1503
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,270
Like the cute collection ones!

1504
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,630
The one with the little dogs and stuff!

1505
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:15,570
Um...

1506
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:16,410
So...

1507
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:17,730
Um...

1508
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:18,790
So that...

1509
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:19,610
I've been like...

1510
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:21,110
A Popmart collector over the years!

1511
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:22,190
But never LaBooBoos!

1512
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:22,670
Cause I was...

1513
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:23,810
I always thought they were like...

1514
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:24,350
Pretty ugly!

1515
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,250
IMO!

1516
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,730
Ha ha ha ha!

1517
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:27,410
Ha ha ha!

1518
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,090
Ha ha ha!

1519
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:28,130
Yeah!

1520
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:30,010
Uh...

1521
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:30,370
Yeah!

1522
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,590
They're like the new Beanie Babies right now!

1523
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:33,490
And...

1524
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:33,690
Uh...

1525
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,290
I was watching a short about like...

1526
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:36,170
This...

1527
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:36,850
Girl...

1528
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:37,650
This woman...

1529
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:38,390
I would say girl...

1530
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,890
But she's like a fucking grown-ass adult!

1531
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,110
Ha ha ha!

1532
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:41,610
Ha ha ha!

1533
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:42,630
Ha ha ha!

1534
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,470
Ha ha ha!

1535
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:43,510
Ha ha ha!

1536
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:55,230
Ha ha ha!

1537
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:55,590
Uh...

1538
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:56,390
Box collection!

1539
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:56,910
Like...

1540
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,150
That's based off of like...

1541
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:58,970
Pastel colors!

1542
01:03:59,230 --> 01:03:59,610
Cause like...

1543
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,730
Bitches love pastel colors!

1544
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:01,770
And I'm one of those bitches!

1545
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,150
Um...

1546
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,210
Ha ha ha!

1547
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:05,250
Ha ha ha!

1548
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:05,330
Ha ha ha!

1549
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:06,710
Ha ha ha!

1550
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,450
That's right!

1551
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,350
I'm one of them too!

1552
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:10,750
Ha ha ha!

1553
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:11,850
And...

1554
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:12,550
Ha ha ha!

1555
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:13,870
Um...

1556
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:25,210
Um...

1557
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,530
They do like these like...

1558
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:26,970
What is it?

1559
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,130
Pop Mart auctions?

1560
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,690

1561
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:30,110
Uh...

1562
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:31,570
They basically like...

1563
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:31,950

So it's like...

1567
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:34,690

You can only buy it on like...

1583
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:52,910

Oh my god!

1585
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:03,790
Even how...

1586
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:05,310
Hire scalpers to scalp for...

1587
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:05,850
Yeah!

1588
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:06,310
Yeah!

1589
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,990
It's actually...

1590
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,770
Influencer marketing is so crazy!

1591
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:09,130
Yeah!

1592
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:11,190
It's so crazy right now!

1593
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,890
It's actually so interesting!

1594
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:15,170
Cause like...

1595
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:16,950
TikTok now has a section for...

1596
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:17,730
Where you just...

1597
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,290
You can auction items out!

1598
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:19,510
Like...

1599
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,870
It was like the TikTok marketplace!

1600
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:23,870
Yeah!

1601
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:25,290
It's like the Beanie Babies again!

1602
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:26,030
But it's like...

1603
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:26,950
I guess like...

1604
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:27,490
Less...

1605
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,150
Mass-produced!

1606
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:28,830
Because like...

1607
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:30,390
Popmark figures...

1608
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,710
Popmark figures are more of like...

1609
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,070
Artistic figures and stuff!

1610
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,290
Because a lot of the...

1611
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,170
Um...

1612
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:38,050
A lot of the figures you see from Popmark...

1613
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:38,890
Are like...

1614
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:39,970
Higher quality...

1615
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:40,950
Resin figures!

1616
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,050
Which is a lot more...

1617
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:43,130
Expensive!

1618
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,790
Yeah!

1619
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:48,910
TikTok has a marketplace!

1620
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,690
So at least like...

1621
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:51,870
The quality is better!

1622
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:56,310
When I was at like a night market...

1623
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:57,410
There were so many...

1624
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:57,870
Like...

1625
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,070
When I was at like a night market...

1626
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,870
Um...

1627
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:01,110
Um...

1628
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:02,010
There's like...

1629
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,690
Like where they sell like random stuff...

1630
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:04,170
Like you know...

1631
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:04,430
Like...

1632
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:05,570
Like stalls there...

1633
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:06,810
That would sell their own stuff...

1634
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:08,350
There were so many stalls...

1635
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,910
Dedicated to like...

1636
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,230
Like...

1637
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,230
La Boo Boo...

1638
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:12,850
Accessories!

1639
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:19,970
And there was one song that said, we have la boo-boos.

1640
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:28,390
They're like, we have authentic la boo-boos.

1641
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,430
Like on the side.

1642

And then it was like, full of people.

1644
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:47,510
la boo-boos with like custom made, like, hand knitted clothes and stuff.

1645
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,570
So they can like put, like dress them up and shit like that.

1646
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:51,690
There were so many.

1647
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,210
I was like, it was crazy.

1648
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,790
I've never had Dubai chocolate before.

1649
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,730
I've always wanted to try it.

1650
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,050
Alright, what's in this?

1651
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:02,830
What's in my chest?

1652
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,450
I have a football helmet.

1653
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,470
Oh my god, this might be rare.

1654
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,010
Okay, $19.

1655
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:12,230
That's, oh my god, and a screwdriver.

1656
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,030
Mama's making some money now.

1657
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:16,230
Oh.

1658
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:17,830
Okay, $6.

1659
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,190
Wait, that's fucking it?

1660
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,990
Wait, he's a collector.

1661
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:27,870
Maybe it's like, a screwdriver from the 1950s.

1662
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,170
Oh my god, I know what to do.

1663
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,360
Don't worry guys.

1664
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,720
I got a screwdriver from the war.

1665
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,940
From one of the world wars.

1666
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,160
This screwdriver...

1667
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,040
I'm like, what is it called?

1668
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:42,660
Pawn Stars?

1669
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,800
This screwdriver was from what...

1670
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,780
From World War II during the 1940s.

1671
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:53,880
Where this particular screwdriver was used to make...

1672
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,880
To make the plane that was at...

1673
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,080
What was it?

1674
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:01,400
Britain?

1675
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:02,620
Uh...

1676
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,380
Was it No Man's Day?

1677
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:03,760
No.

1678
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:04,960
What was it?

1679
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:05,780
On D-Day.

1680
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,980
That made the boat.

1681
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,840
That drove to D-Day.

1682
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,940
I know a guy.

1683
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:14,800
Don't worry.

1684
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,700
Um...

1685
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,900
Best I can do is $5.

1686
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:25,140
This screwdriver made that boat.

1687
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,520
That drove over to Europe on D-Day.

1688
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:30,860
Hehehehe.

1689
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,040

01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:38,800
Hehehehe.

1693
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:40,640
Wait, how do I make him buy my screwdriver?

1694
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,340
Bringing up collectibles to unlock unique outfits.

1695
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,300
The list of items.

1696
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,780
Wait, I have a collectible!

1697
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,120
Right here.

1698
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,240
Buy my screwdriver.

1699
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:53,600

1702
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,420
Take my fucking screwdriver!

1703
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,380
How fuck do I give you my screwdriver?

1704
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,220
Instructions unclear!

1705
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:09,480

1706
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,620
You're a collector and I have a collection!

1707
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,700
Hehehehe.

1708
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:17,660
Take it!

1709
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,220
Okay.

1710
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:21,560
I...

1711
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,660
There is the screwdriver!

1712
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,660
It's the same thing!

1713
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,300
Hehehehe.

1714
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,840
I show you my screwdriver!

1715
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,200
Please respond!

1716
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:34,580
Why?

1717
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,080
Oh no, it's stuck now.

1718
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,300
Hehehehe.

1719
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,120
It's stuck.

1720
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,200
Oh no!

1721
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:41,240
No!

1722
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,160
It's underneath the map!

1723
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:43,540
No!

1724
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,520
My 1940 screwdriver!

1725
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,760
It's okay.

1726
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:51,780
I still have my helmet.

1727
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,700
It's fine.

1728
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,340
I still have my helmet.

1729
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,520
It's gone forever.

1730
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,620
I still have my helmet.

1731
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,900
Don't worry.

1732
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,120
They all laugh at me now.

1733
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,860
Wait until I invent Amazon.

1734
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:08,780
Hehehehe.

1735
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,140
My investment.

1736
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,860
My investment!

1737
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,120
Hehehehe.

1738
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:14,620
Alright.

1739
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:15,920
It's fine.

1740
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,040
I'm gonna sell my helmet before I go home.

1741
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:18,880
No!

1742
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,460
It's closed!

1743
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,320
Okay, I'll go home then, I guess.

1744
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,600
Today was an...

1745
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,260
I might...

1746
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:26,620
Don't worry.

1747
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,020
I might be short on rent.

1748
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,020
But like...

1749
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,280
They know...

1750
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,920
I'll write an I.O.U.

1751
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,660
to my...

1752
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,260
Rent Lord.

1753
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,780
My Land Lord.

1754
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,480
Alright.

1755
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:37,620
It's fine.

1756
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,100
I'll be...

1757
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,420
I'll have enough money to like...

1758
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:45,060
Buy those like tools that let me see what chest it is.

1759
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:45,960
We didn't lose!

1760
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,060
The Storage Wars!

1761
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,540
We won!

1762
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,380
We won our two auctions!

1763
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:51,480
Oh!

1764
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,000
Rent Lord.

1765
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:54,800
Hehehehe.

1766
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,220
Alright.

1767
01:10:58,580 --> 01:10:59,300
Let's see.

1768
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,460
I'll put you here.

1769
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,780
No one will steal this.

1770
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,200
Like, we all live in a dump.

1771
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,120
Why would you...

1772
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,660
Why would any of you steal this?

1773
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:08,720
Okay.

1774
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:09,520
There you go.

1775
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,320
It's time to sleep.

1776
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:12,460
Alright.

1777
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,700
My loans.

1778
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:15,140
Oh!

1779
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,280
I can take a loan!

1780
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:19,920
Okay.

1781
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,620
I am paying it in.

1782
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,220
I shouldn't.

1783
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,700
Oh, but it's...

1784
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:31,640
I...

1785
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:31,960
But...

1786
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,960
Imagine the amount of storages I can win though.

1787
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:36,900
Alright.

1788
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:37,360
Sleep.

1789
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,540
Hey, all items outside of your warehouse and car will be cleared.

1790
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:47,680
Every day, all items outside of your warehouse and car will be cleared.

1791
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:48,720
Wait!

1792
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,220
What?

1793
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:49,960
No!

1794
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,000
Oh my god.

1795
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:51,960
They can't take it.

1796
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:52,960
They can't take this.

1797
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,060
I worked so hard!

1798
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:54,860
Okay.

1799
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,920
I'll put it in my house.

1800
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,360
They're like decorations.

1801
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,880
It's decorations!

1802
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:02,880
Look!

1803
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,700
It's my favorite football helmet!

1804
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,220
And then, like...

1805
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,560
This is the necklace that I wear.

1806
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,000
That I wear every time I go to sleep.

1807
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,040
No!

1808
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,160
It said if they put...

1809
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:17,240
Oh!

1810
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:17,800
It's my necklace!

1811
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:18,220
Oh!

1812
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:18,800
It's my necklace!

1813
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,120
It said like...

1814
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,240
This is my necklace that I got from my grandma.

1815
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,140
No!

1816
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:25,860
Don't disappear!

1817
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,140
Don't disappear!

1818
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,980
It says everything in my car will disappear!

1819
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,120
No!

1820
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:31,920
Don't disappear!

1821
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,090
I'm like that Batman holding...

1822
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,520
Holding his...

1823
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,000
Dead parents.

1824
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,140
Body's like...

1825
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:36,220
No!

1826
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:36,480
No!

1827
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:36,820
No!

1828
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:37,780
No!

1829
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,340
Don't leave me!

1830
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:42,920
No!

1831
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,760
Don't leave me!

1832
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:51,840
Okay.

1833
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:54,720
Okay.

1834
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,900
I love this chest like it's my parent.

1835
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,340
It's got dark rope.

1836
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,680
Damn, Batman.

1837
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,260
You need therapy.

1838
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,680
Did Batman ever go to therapy?

1839
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,340
Or did like...

1840
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,860
Or did he just, as a child, just...

1841
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,880
Was just rich?

1842
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,080
Is that therapy enough?

1843
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,720
I don't know if they ever gave Batman therapy.

1844
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,120
Okay.

1845
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:19,680
I...

1846
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,180
Wait.

1847
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,480
Outside of my warehouse and car will be...

1848
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:23,680
Wait!

1849
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,500
Does that mean if it's in the car, it'll be okay?

1850
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,900
It says outside of my car.

1851
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:30,800
Oh!

1852
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,380
Is it outside of warehouse and outside a car?

1853
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,580
Or outside of warehouse and in the car?

1854
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:38,440
Like...

1855
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,600
It doesn't make sense!

1856
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,000
Okay.

1857
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,160
In the car will be fine.

1858
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:48,420
Okay.

1859
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,320
It's 3am.

1860
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,180
It's okay.

1861
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,860
They understand.

1862
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:55,340
Wait, what?

1863
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:56,220
What's this?

1864
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,360
What the fuck is this?

1865
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,820
What the fuck is this?

1866
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:02,680
Is that my money?

1867
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:03,860
Okay.

1868
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:04,400
Don't worry.

1869
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,440
We gotta keep this chest.

1870
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,060
It's fine.

1871
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,600
It's Tetris again.

1872
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:34,620
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and that's why we don't see them as often anymore.

1873
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,720
I've never actually seen a real firefly to be fair.

1874
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:38,300
Yeah.

1875
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:43,460
Yeah, fireflies are... That's why Minecraft removed fireflies.

1876
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:59,500
Because they thought it was like... Also because they're poisonous to frogs, but... But apparently, fireflies are like endangered species now.

1877
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,040
Yeah.

1878
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,200
It's pretty sad.

1879
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,720
I think it's like because of pesticides or some shit.

1880
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:08,680
It's usually pesticides.

1881
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,160
Wait, it's 4 in the morning.

1882
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:10,920
It's already sun?

1883
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,180
Alright.

1884
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,060
We sleep now.

1885
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:21,010
I earn... spent... Yay!

1886
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,950
$62 profit!

1887
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:24,190
Look at that.

1888
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:25,490
See, guys?

1889
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:30,330
You gotta... You gotta... Uh... Wait, what the fuck is that?

1890
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:31,330
Holy shit.

1891
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:32,090
Go, Grandpa.

1892
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:32,550
Go.

1893
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,790
You gotta spend money to earn money.

1894
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:36,890
Look at him.

1895
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:37,070
Go.

1896
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:37,950
Oh my god.

1897
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:40,050
He was a nom, guys.

1898
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:44,250
Uh... He's a grown ass man that dresses like a bat to punch people.

1899
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:47,190
And you think he went to therapy.

1900
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:48,490
NSD.

1901
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:49,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1902
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,350
Thank you.

1903
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:51,070
Thank you.

1904
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:52,690
Uh... Ultra.

1905
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:53,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1906
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:54,050
Thank you.

1907
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:54,650
Thank you.

1908
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:56,030
Flashback Batman.

1909
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,850
This is where I watch my parents die.

1910
01:15:58,230 --> 01:15:58,950
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1911
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:00,790
Oh my god.

1912
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:01,490
Batman.

1913
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:03,390
Ha ha ha ha.

1914
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,710
Grandpa.

1915
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:07,510
I got these gains, bro.

1916
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,570
I don't need gas yet, right?

1917
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:10,310
No.

1918
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:13,790
I'm not wasting my money on stupid things like gas.

1919
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,390
Oh my god.

1920
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:20,350
I wasted gas.

1921
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:31,870
Oh my god.

1922
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:32,810
Stupid pull.

1923
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:34,490
Why did you put that there?

1924
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:37,990
Alright.

1925
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:38,350
Alright.

1926
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,070
I'm ready for my next storage war.

1927
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:43,870
Sign me up, baby.

1928
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,150
Or is it?

1929
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:48,950
Nobody's gonna outbid me.

1930
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:52,210
I know what I want.

1931
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:54,110
Get me in there.

1932
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:55,150
Okay.

1933
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:55,850
There's another chest.

1934
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:56,410
Oh my god.

1935
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:56,810
There's two.

1936
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:57,570
Oh my god.

1937
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:58,550
Do you see that box right there?

1938
01:16:58,770 --> 01:16:59,950
That's my N64.

1939
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,970
Ha ha ha ha.

1940
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:02,670
Ha ha ha.

1941
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,030
We're getting rich today.

1942
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,260
Get me in there.

1943
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:12,780
Fuck you, Dennis.

1944
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:13,860
You don't need this.

1945
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,460
You go to college.

1946
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,240
I'm a high school dropout.

1947
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,520
That's right.

1948
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,380
Didn't Jeff Bezos dropout?

1949
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,540
Oh no, that's like all the other multi-millionaires.

1950
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:31,620
I was gonna say, like... I know, like... You know the crazy thing?

1951
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,480
People would be like, yeah, they dropped out of college and became millionaires.

1952
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,300
But then, like, majority of those people that do that?

1953
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:37,840
Alright.

1954
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,540
Harvard dropouts.

1955
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,580
Like... Ha ha ha.

1956
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,040
Like, they fucking already made it to Harvard.

1957
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,160
Like, you're different.

1958
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:45,940
You're not him.

1959
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,400
You're... Ha ha ha.

1960
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:47,900
Yeah.

1961
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,320
It's always like... Wait, is that a... Oh, a Valentine's bouquet.

1962
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,220
Oh, that's sad.

1963
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,820
They're always like, yeah, but they dropped out of college.

1964
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:00,560
And look, they're okay.

1965
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,460
Yeah, because they fucking went to Harvard.

1966
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:04,640
Yeah.

1967
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,460
I had a phone.

1968
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:06,360
Oh my god!

1969
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,380
That's a phone from the 1800s.

1970
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,680
Ha ha ha ha.

1971
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,380
Ha ha ha.

1972
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:17,920
Oh my god, those ancient phones went like... Ha ha ha ha.

1973
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,040
This must be a phone from the 1800s.

1974
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,520
Look at how ancient it is.

1975
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,060
Ha ha ha ha.

1976
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:26,520
You only see them in hotels now.

1977
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,040
Is this instant sales?

1978
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:30,800
Is this instant sales?

1979
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:30,800
Instant sales?

1980
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,400
Instant sales?

1981
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:32,920
Instant sales?

1982
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:33,440
Kitchen module?

1983
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,580
Look at that.

1984
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,740
I made back my money instantly.

1985
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,160
Alright.

1986
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,260
The ancient Nokia from the 1900s.

1987
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,320
Ha ha ha ha.

1988
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,520
Alright, let's grab this phone.

1989
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,420
Is that the first phone ever made?

1990
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:54,900
I only see these in old hotels.

1991
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:55,980
Ha ha ha ha.

1992
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,600
Ha ha ha ha.

1993
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,080
I will put the chest here for now.

1994
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,100
Uh... Ha ha ha.

1995
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:03,060
Physical!

1996
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,080
Look at them!

1997
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:05,020
You have...

1998
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:05,760
There's buttons!

1999
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:06,820
Ha ha ha.

2000
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,460
There's... There's... Oh my god.

2001
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,040
Wait, how rare is this cowboy boot?

2002
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,520
How do I afford verification too?

2003
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,800
I'm putting this cowboy boot in here.

2004
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,580
I'm gonna hoard all these chests.

2005
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,680
Until that I can... I can, like, sell them.

2006
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,060
Alright.

2007
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,800
Put this phone in here.

2008
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,940
Yep, that obsolete phone is, like, $300.

2009
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:36,200
Oh, the pawn store.

2010
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,100
This should be, like, pawn store simulator.

2011
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:40,280
Pawn store and storage hunter simulator.

2012
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,700
We got both of them at the same time.

2013
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,280
Like, can I even... I can't even fix anything.

2014
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,440
Like, I'm useless.

2015
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,100
Create... I miss pawn stores when they, like... When they were, like, not assholes.

2016
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,540
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2017
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:06,800
Cause that show was actually so... Cause, like... I like how it was on the History Channel.

2018
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,400
Cause they were, like, oh, yes.

2019
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:12,280
This item used to be, like, uh, in the 1800s.

2020
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:12,680
Like, yeah.

2021
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,380
And, like, they made the ghost sound, like, so fucking smart.

2022
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:18,640
Like, knowing exactly, like... Ha ha ha ha.

2023
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,300
Oh, what?

2024
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:19,880
The items.

2025
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,520
Like, back then, they used to do this and that.

2026
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,740
I'm like, wow, he's so smart.

2027
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:26,860
Ha ha ha ha.

2028
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,420
Can't believe he knew all of these fun facts.

2029
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,160
Yeah, it was fun.

2030
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,220
And then he's like, best I could do was ten dollars.

2031
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,060
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2032
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:41,320
Ha ha ha ha.

2033
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,580
Yeah, and then fucking, what's the same, Steve Carell showed up and I was like, wait a minute.

2034
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,920
What the fuck is Steve Carell doing in Las Vegas right now in pawn stores?

2035
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:54,860
Like... Ha ha ha ha.

2036
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,680
Like, I was like, excuse me, Steve Carell?

2037
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,760
You're not that desperate for money.

2038
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,960
You have... You have the office money that you can live up...

2039
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,340
That you... Oh my god.

2040
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:07,780
Dude, dude...

2041
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:13,500
Steve Carell literally has office, like, um, serialization money.

2042
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,220
He doesn't need to wear your shit.

2043
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:17,000
He's set for life.

2044
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,190
Yeah, the syndication money.

2045
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:24,770
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2046
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:25,990
He was gambling.

2047
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:27,230
Ha ha ha ha.

2048
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,290
The royalties from the office.

2049
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:33,290
Like, he could get more money.

2050
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:37,750
I feel like Steve Carell is, like, one of those actors that's just doing it for fun now.

2051
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:41,410
Cause he's like, he does so many, like, serious shit these days.

2052
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:43,390
Okay.

2053
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:45,790
Nice.

2054
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:47,470
A thousand yet?

2055
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:50,150
How do I have less than a thousand dollars?

2056
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:53,310
Oh my god, it includes, like, money I've spent.

2057
01:21:53,630 --> 01:21:54,290
I'll never...

2058
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:57,690
Oh my god, it's gonna take me fucking forever and make it to a thousand.

2059
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:04,270
I feel like a lot of comedy actors now do, like...

2060
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:05,830
Um...

2061
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:06,890
Do, like, serious shit.

2062
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:10,710
Alright.

2063
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,690
Like, all the old...

2064
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:15,430
Like, the old...

2065
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,670
I, like, I say old school comedy actors.

2066
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,290
I'm gonna make someone feel so fucking old saying that.

2067
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:23,710
Steve Carell, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller.

2068
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:30,010
Like, the old classic comedy actors are now, like, going into, like, drama.

2069
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:31,190
Um...

2070
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:31,670
And everything.

2071
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:33,050
Is this Steve Carell?

2072
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:34,050
Like, almost 60?

2073
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:40,310
Ben Toki?

2074
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:40,690
Ben Toki?

2075
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:41,970
They're, like, vintage now, right?

2076
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,800
I love Ben Stiller's, um...

2077
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,200
What was it?

2078
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:53,620
Severin?

2079
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,360
Severin's is...

2080
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,260
Okay, I think...

2081
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,760
Oh, I'm gonna refill my gas.

2082
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,120
It's okay.

2083
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,180
I still have some left.

2084
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:00,360
Okay.

2085
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,580
It's fine.

2086
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,420
I still have some gas left.

2087
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:07,820
Oh, my God.

2088
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,480
Almost there.

2089
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:09,840
Oh, my God.

2090
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:09,880
Nice.

2091
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:10,560
69.

2092
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:11,960
All right.

2093
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,160
We gotta go to a gas station.

2094
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,420
Oh, my God.

2095
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,720
Steve Carell is 67?

2096
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,000
That's crazy.

2097
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,560
I did not realize he is 67 now.

2098
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,240
Yeah.

2099
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,900
Ben Stiller's also old school.

2100
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,100
Don't worry.

2101
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:27,960
We'll fill up our gas.

2102
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,340
Guys, I don't think we're ever making it to a thousand.

2103
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,240
Nice.

2104
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,320
Wait.

2105
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,520
That didn't refill shit.

2106
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,320
Okay, we'll spend half money.

2107
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:42,760
All right.

2108
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:43,840
And then we'll go back.

2109
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,600
We're gonna go back.

2110
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,140
Oh, shit.

2111
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,240
Don't worry.

2112
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,800
I know where it is.

2113
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,540
That's my money maker right there.

2114
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,200
Don't worry.

2115
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,240
I'll get to a thousand soon.

2116
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:04,080
Don't worry.

2117
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:07,580
All right.

2118
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,600
This is my big ticket item.

2119
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,560
This is what's gonna push me over the edge.

2120
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,500
Right here.

2121
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,880
I think when I hit a thousand dollars, I can start repairing shit.

2122
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:19,580
All right.

2123
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:24,900
This is it.

2124
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,320
This is it, guys.

2125
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:34,680
The moment I sell this, I'll finally stop living paycheck by paycheck.

2126
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:38,910
Don't worry.

2127
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:39,710
We'll make it.

2128
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:42,250
I'll make it back there for the second storage wars.

2129
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:44,930
Nice.

2130
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:46,390
All right.

2131
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:47,790
And I should...

2132
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:51,030
I'm not bankrupt yet.

2133
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:54,570
I just need to complete this tutorial mission.

2134
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:56,530
That I'm still doing.

2135
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:58,270
We're almost there.

2136
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:01,830
We'll progress past tutorial.

2137
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,710
It's just a thousand dollars.

2138
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:09,440
Here we go.

2139
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:10,860
All right.

2140
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,000
Coming up.

2141
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,780
It's at 3 p.m.

2142
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:15,780
Are you serious?

2143
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,380
How would I make money?

2144
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,620
Open the trade.

2145
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,600
Open up.

2146
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,260
I need my money.

2147
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:27,580
Wait.

2148
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,140
Where's my truck?

2149
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,380
Oh shit.

2150
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:29,980
It's over there.

2151
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:32,020
Oh my.

2152
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:32,820
What do I do now?

2153
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,300
There's no storages for me to bid.

2154
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:36,760
This is my only job.

2155
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,560
I can't.

2156
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,380
I can't sell any of these stupid chests.

2157
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,140
This is gas.

2158
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,500
This is a car.

2159
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,240
Do I get a cell at the bunker?

2160
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:52,840
I mean...

2161
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,300
I can buy a bomb.

2162
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,280
What the fuck am I gonna do with a bomb?

2163
01:25:59,140 --> 01:25:59,620
Wait.

2164
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:00,680
Maybe the big city.

2165
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,140
Maybe they'll need me there at the big city.

2166
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:05,440
Okay.

2167
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:06,620
There's an archaeologist.

2168
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,160
Oh my god.

2169
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:07,760
I told you guys.

2170
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,540
I know a guy.

2171
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:09,460
I...

2172
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,020
Guys, I told you.

2173
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,420
I know a guy.

2174
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:19,360
Mr. Broken Bond.

2175
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,380
Thank you for the super chat.

2176
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,000
Thank you.

2177
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,800
For the next movie.

2178
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:22,760
Watch that.

2179
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,920
Can we do the Mario live action movie?

2180
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,280
Oh, the really shitty one?

2181
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,240
The one that made Nintendo be like...

2182
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:29,800
No more...

2183
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,680
No more movies.

2184
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,540
So there's that.

2185
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:37,700
This reminds me of...

2186
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,540
Like the map reminds me of schedule one.

2187
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,660
The taste of art.

2188
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:41,520
Oh my god.

2189
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:41,740
Wait.

2190
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,620
I can find...

2191
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,140
I can find the Mona Lisa!

2192
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,740
It's crazy that...

2193
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:50,160
Uh...

2194
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,260
Illumination...

2195
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:53,640
Basically saved Nintendo and movies.

2196
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:56,920
Eh...

2197
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,480
It starts at 3...

2198
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,920
What the fuck am I gonna do with my time until 3pm?

2199
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,220
Okay.

2200
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,540
I can't waste gas though.

2201
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:03,480
Because like...

2202
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,380
Gas is expensive.

2203
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:08,880
Eh...

2204
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,560
I can't believe you did it with my screwdriver from the 1950s.

2205
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:15,920
A blueberry pawn shop.

2206
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,480
I only got an hour.

2207
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:18,920
You're right.

2208
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:19,540
I have an hour.

2209
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:20,660
I can wait for an hour.

2210
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,220
Illumination saved Nintendo by making the Switch 2.

2211
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,700
I still can't believe they retconned Donkey Kong and gave him pants.

2212
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,840
In the new game.

2213
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:41,330
That's crazy.

2214
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,770
I think that one was the craziest thing.

2215
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:47,010
They made it so that him wearing pants is like default now.

2216
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:48,010
Like...

2217
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:49,510
Only in...

2218
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:50,450
Yeah, like...

2219
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:51,750
In the newest game.

2220
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:54,610
His default outfit is him with pants on.

2221
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:56,010
The truest tragedy.

2222
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:56,970
Yeah.

2223
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,670
But you can't take off his clothes.

2224
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:00,450
But then like...

2225
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:01,470
The...

2226
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:03,710
Description to take off his clothes like...

2227
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:04,290
Judges you.

2228
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:05,170
You're like...

2229
01:28:05,170 --> 01:28:05,390
Wow.

2230
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:06,650
He's naked now.

2231
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:07,610
Uh...

2232
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:08,930
Like the day he was born.

2233
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:10,370
And it sounded like...

2234
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:12,070
It's like obviously judging you.

2235
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:14,190
Like why did you take off his pants like...

2236
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:14,630
Like...

2237
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:14,990
Like...

2238
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:17,930
Three donkeys Kong!

2239
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:20,850
Like...

2240
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:25,130
Like...

2241
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:25,690
Like...

2242
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:26,930
Like...

2243
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:28,190
Like...

2244
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,050
Like...

2245
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:46,550
I...

2246
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:47,670
Apparently the game...

2247
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:48,550
Oh...

2248
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:48,970
Uh...

2249
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:51,590
Apparently the new Donkey Kong game is really good.

2250
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:53,370
From what I've read.

2251
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:55,190
But then the review was from IGN.

2252
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:55,890
So I don't know.

2253
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:56,650
I never...

2254
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:00,230
The review itself is from IGN.

2255
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:00,810
So like...

2256
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:01,810
Is it actually...

2257
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:02,390
That good?

2258
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:04,570
IGN gave it a 10 out of 10.

2259
01:29:04,910 --> 01:29:05,410
But...

2260
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:05,610
Like...

2261
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:08,590
I've never trusted IGN since they said too much water.

2262
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:11,830
In the...

2263
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:14,110
In the Pokemon game...

2264
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:15,090
That...

2265
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:16,330
Was about...

2266
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:16,990
Water.

2267
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:26,470
That's when I stopped trusting IGN.

2268
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:28,130
Sign me up.

2269
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,430
I'm ready.

2270
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:33,270
I'm fucking ready.

2271
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:36,170
I'm fucking ready.

2272
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:36,670
Let me see.

2273
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:38,210
Oh my god!

2274
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:39,050
There's a dead man!

2275
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:39,950
I'm bidding.

2276
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:48,010
That could be a lot of money guys.

2277
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:50,390
I mean that's some clout.

2278
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:55,010
He might still have his wallet on him.

2279
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:56,010
No way.

2280
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:58,670
I'm...

2281
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:01,030
They think of the potential organ.

2282
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:03,010
Give it to me.

2283
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,810
That's right!

2284
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,650
Yes!

2285
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:05,410
Going one...

2286
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:05,650
No!

2287
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:07,010
You bitch, Kate!

2288
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:08,870
What are you gonna do with a dead body?

2289
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:12,210
Oh my god.

2290
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:13,370
A dead body.

2291
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:13,970
I'm in.

2292
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:17,590
Doki, what are you gonna do with a dead body?

2293
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:18,270
Yay!

2294
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:22,050
Holy shit!

2295
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:25,370
I can instantly sell this dead body.

2296
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:26,410
Nice.

2297
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:27,110
Alright.

2298
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,610
There's a Valentine's.

2299
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:29,990
Aww!

2300
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:31,530
He got rejected.

2301
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,150
Okay.

2302
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:32,910
Aww!

2303
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,030
You know...

2304
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:34,710
What the fuck?

2305
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:36,050
An eyewash station.

2306
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:37,790
You can tell why he died.

2307
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:38,710
Aww.

2308
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:42,170
A Christmas present bag.

2309
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:43,990
Okay.

2310
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:46,950
I need a fixing tool too for this.

2311
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:48,390
And I can't open it yet.

2312
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:50,170
Alright.

2313
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:50,310
Alright.

2314
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:51,930
That's $210.

2315
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:53,710
$22.

2316
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:54,850
Oh wait!

2317
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:55,490
Some...

2318
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:56,950
That's a collector's item, isn't it?

2319
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:00,090
Instant cell.

2320
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,330
A snow tube.

2321
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:02,390
Alright.

2322
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:04,570
There's a...

2323
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:07,470
This guy got rejected on Valentine's Day.

2324
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:09,290
And now he's...

2325
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:09,530
Yeah.

2326
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:14,130
Look at him.

2327
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:16,050
This poor guy.

2328
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:17,130
How much...

2329
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:17,870
How much money...

2330
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:18,410
Okay, guys.

2331
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:19,070
Alright.

2332
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,490
How much money do you think I'll get from this dead body?

2333
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:26,190
And then his heart broke and he was...

2334
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:26,930
I can't...

2335
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:28,770
Unfortunately, I can't scan him.

2336
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:29,590
I know.

2337
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:34,270
I have nine items in here.

2338
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:35,670
Alright.

2339
01:31:35,670 --> 01:31:35,890
Alright.

2340
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,350
Let's see how much icky...

2341
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:37,930
How much he is.

2342
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:38,890
I have...

2343
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:39,950
$675.

2344
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,420
Oh, that's sad.

2345
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:52,960
It's like...

2346
01:31:54,580 --> 01:32:01,860
Imagine being rejected on Valentine's Day and all you're worth was $1 in the end.

2347
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:03,160
A whole dollar.

2348
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,260
A whole dollar.

2349
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,780
Jesus Christ.

2350
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,420
A whole dollar.

2351
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:10,080
Bro, it's only worth $1.

2352
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,140
That reminded me of that time...

2353
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,300
Like...

2354
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,820
This guy...

2355
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:19,320
This woman donated her body to science.

2356
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:29,000
And then the son found out that the hospital donated her body to the military.

2357
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,720
And then the military exploded...

2358
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,220
Used it to test explosions.

2359
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,600
Used it to test explosions.

2360
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:41,860
Yeah.

2361
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:42,860
Yeah.

2362
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,140
It blew up the...

2363
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:47,200
The fucking mom's body.

2364
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,560
It was so fucked up.

2365
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,040
It was like...

2366
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:50,820
It was like...

2367
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:56,100
My mom donated her body for science in hopes that it can help the student...

2368
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,480
Medical students there.

2369
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:01,840
And then the hospital sold it to the military.

2370
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,560
What the hell?

2371
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:11,260
It is so messed up.

2372
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:15,700
You don't get to choose the science.

2373
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,380
They got...

2374
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,500
Yeah, they got the wrong science.

2375
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,140
Clearly.

2376
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,320
Alright.

2377
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,420
Buy my shit.

2378
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,020
Oh my...

2379
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:30,760
I'm gonna get it.

2380
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:33,060
I'm gonna make you to a thousand dollars, baby.

2381
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,260
Why are you laughing?

2382
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:39,020
His mom got turned into a lunatic...

2383
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:39,500
Yeah.

2384
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,140
And it was actually crazy.

2385
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:48,220
She thought that her body was being used for some like...

2386
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:51,020
To help medical students everywhere.

2387
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:52,380
Instead it...

2388
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,220
Got sold.

2389
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:55,620
That's like crazy.

2390
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,080
What's this?

2391
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,400
Halloween haystack.

2392
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:02,600
Yeah.

2393
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,020
I can donate it to the horses.

2394
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,360
Oh my god.

2395
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:09,960
I need a bigger car.

2396
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,420
A hat.

2397
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:15,460
Thank you for the super chat.

2398
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:15,840
Thank you.

2399
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:16,620
Thank you.

2400
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,860
Almost as funny as that time when the hospital sent the son a huge bill for transportation costs.

2401
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:23,520
After his son donated...

2402
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,120
After his mom donated her body...

2403
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,200
Oh my god.

2404
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:29,300
That's crazy.

2405
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:33,360
Actually donating your body...

2406
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,140
For the sake of science.

2407
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:36,440
And then they're like...

2408
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:36,560
Alright.

2409
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:37,680
Here's the bill.

2410
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,280
Your mom was not worth that much in scientific discovery.

2411
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,000
That's actually insane.

2412
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:46,960
That that's...

2413
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,360
Happened.

2414
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,680
I didn't even know about that.

2415
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:53,220
Oh my god.

2416
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,380
This is the fucking...

2417
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:55,800
Crustiest...

2418
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,140
Fucking beach...

2419
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,000
Towel ever.

2420
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:01,680
Yeah, I can Tetris.

2421
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:02,320
Actually...

2422
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:02,880
Yeah, I can...

2423
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:03,960
I can Tetris this.

2424
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:08,540
For those of you who aren't American...

2425
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:10,280
And don't know about this...

2426
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,020
But like...

2427
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:11,660
Even like...

2428
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:12,780
Ambulance rides...

2429
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:14,220
You need to pay a bill...

2430
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:15,240
For ambulance rides.

2431
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:16,040
And they're like what?

2432
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:17,960
Four figures or some shit?

2433
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,360
So some people...

2434
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,460
If they're in like an act...

2435
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,100
If they're like...

2436
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:21,520
I don't know...

2437
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,460
Bleeding or something...

2438
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:24,040
You know...

2439
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:24,680
With like...

2440
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:25,540
A sort of...

2441
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:25,920
Like...

2442
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,220
Major injury...

2443
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:28,440
And they're bleeding out...

2444
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,220
Some people...

2445
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:30,020
Or like...

2446
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:31,400
Or their water broke...

2447
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,740
Some people will just like...

2448
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:34,320
Order an Uber...

2449
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,320
For it...

2450
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,140
Cause it's cheaper.

2451
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,500
I read stories of people ordering Ubers...

2452
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,480
Uh...

2453
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,220
Ordering Ubers to the hospital...

2454
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:44,340
Cause it's cheaper than getting an ambulance over.

2455
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:48,760
Okay...

2456
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:49,600
I sell that...

2457
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,960
And then getting the chest...

2458
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,460
Get that chest over here.

2459
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:54,720
Yeah...

2460
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:55,460
Uber is cheaper...

2461
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,340
And sometimes faster.

2462
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,240
Oh that's...

2463
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:00,580
Okay...

2464
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:02,060
That's like...

2465
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:02,860
Funny...

2466
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:03,680
But also fucked up.

2467
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:04,980
Someone in chat was like...

2468
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:05,540
Oh yeah...

2469
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:07,840
There was a story of a guy that got hit by an ambulance...

2470
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:08,420
And then they...

2471
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:09,680
Charged him!

2472
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,700
That's actually...

2473
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,120
That's crazy...

2474
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,220
Imagine getting hit by...

2475
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:17,980
Oh my god...

2476
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,000
Getting hit by an ambulance...

2477
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:20,460
And then...

2478
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:21,080
You're like...

2479
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:21,920
Oh thank god...

2480
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,920
At least it was an ambulance that hit me...

2481
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,120
And then you get charged from the ride...

2482
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:27,720
Oh man...

2483
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:35,860
It was an accident guys...

2484
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:36,480
Like...

2485
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:36,920
With a...

2486
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,960
Crying...

2487
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:46,470
The infinite money glitch...

2488
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:51,890
Holy

2489
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:58,910
shit...

2490
01:36:58,910 --> 01:36:59,750
The man...

2491
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:00,810
Thank you for the super chat...

2492
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:01,130
Thank you...

2493
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:02,690
Thank you...

2494
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:05,950
A body farm to watch people rot?

2495
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:08,690
Holy shit...

2496
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:10,630
Okay...

2497
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:11,690
That's crazy...

2498
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:12,890

2499
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:14,690
I mean...

2500
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:15,950
I guess...

2501
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:16,310
Science?

2502
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:20,070
I guess like...

2503
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:20,770
Science?

2504
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:21,930
Yippee...

2505
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:23,050
Also...

2506
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:23,470
I found...

2507
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:24,410
Remember those like...

2508
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:26,650
I recently found out...

2509
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:27,230
Like...

2510
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:28,170
The...

2511
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:29,610
You know like those...

2512
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:30,730
That famous exhibit?

2513
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:32,410
Where like...

2514
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:33,510
Um...

2515
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,530
Where like...

2516
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:35,110
People...

2517
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:35,610
Have like...

2518
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:36,570

2519
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:37,030
Like...

2520
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:38,590
Being shown and stuff...

01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:40,050
But they're all like...

2522
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:41,010
Like...

2523
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:41,450
Like...

2524
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:42,010
I don't know...

2525
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:42,930
It doesn't rot...

2526
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:43,610
Because they're all like...

2527
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:44,190
Filled with like...

2528
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:45,770
Plasticine or some shit...

2529
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:47,950
And I just recently found out...

2530
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:50,010
That the owner of that exhibit...

2531
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:52,150
Is a fucking crazy billionaire...

2532
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:52,590
Like...

2533
01:37:53,890 --> 01:37:54,450
Like...

2534
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:55,570
Of course like...

2535
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:55,990
You know what?

2536
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:56,790
I'm not surprised...

2537
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:57,090
Cause like...

2538
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:58,390
The idea to do that...

2539
01:37:58,390 --> 01:38:00,230
Had to be absolutely...

2540
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:01,210
Fucking crazy...

2541
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,070
Like...

2542
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,450
To...

2543
01:38:02,450 --> 01:38:02,930
To...

2544
01:38:03,950 --> 01:38:04,290
Um...

2545
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,150
To even have that idea...

2546
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:07,510
But the owner of it...

2547
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:07,890
Is some...

2548
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:08,630
I think he's like...

2549
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:10,370
Austrian or some shit...

2550
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:10,890
Um...

2551
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:12,210
But he's actually...

2552
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:13,570
A crazy billionaire...

2553
01:38:13,570 --> 01:38:13,910
He's like...

2554
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:14,850
Incredibly eccentric...

2555
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:15,670
And everything...

2556
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:16,490
And he's like...

2557
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:17,030
He's like...

2558
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:17,890
Obsessed...

2559
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:19,150
He has like...

2560
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:20,710
He actually has...

2561
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:22,150
A storage...

2562
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:23,250
Filled with fucking...

2563
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,070
Dead bodies...

2564
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:24,470
Like...

2565
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:31,450
I was reading his Wikipedia...

2566
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:33,270
And he's...

2567
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:35,250
He's like an...

2568
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:37,550
He's like an actual...

2569
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:38,390
Like...

2570
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:39,290
Eccentric...

2571
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:40,110
Crazy billionaire...

2572
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:41,110
Like...

2573
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:41,350
Fuck...

2574
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:43,530
It's a private collection...

2575
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:44,450
I thought...

2576
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:45,790
That...

2577
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:47,490
Body exhibit thing...

2578
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:47,930
Okay...

2579
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:48,210
Like...

2580
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:48,730
I mean...

2581
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:49,650
I don't know if he's actually...

2582
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:51,350
I know he's a European...

2583
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:51,850
But like...

2584
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:52,770
He's like...

2585
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:54,510
One of the Germans...

2586
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:54,990
No...

2587
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:56,290
One of the dramatic countries...

2588
01:38:57,790 --> 01:38:58,550
Um...

2589
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:00,410
But...

2590
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:02,290
I legitimately thought...

2591
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:03,210
That like...

2592
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:05,210
I thought...

2593
01:39:05,210 --> 01:39:06,450
That it was like...

2594
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:06,850
An actual...

2595
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:08,290
It's a private collection...

2596
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:09,570
It's not even...

2597
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:09,970
Like...

2598
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:11,950
It's not even like...

2599
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:12,450
A medical...

2600
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:13,290
Like...

2601
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:13,850
Exhibit...

2602
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:14,650
Like an actual...

2603
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:15,650
You know...

2604
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:17,010
Medical exhibit...

2605
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:18,170
For like, science or anything.

2606
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:20,810
It's literally a...

2607
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:28,370
It's his private collection.

2608
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:31,070
And I was like, holy fuck.

2609
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:34,350
And I found out about this, like, this year.

2610
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:36,390
I went to that exhibit, too.

2611
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:43,090
I actually... I went to that exhibit when I was a child.

2612
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:46,790
Okay, he's German.

2613
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:50,310
Okay, his name is Gunther Von Higgins.

2614
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:52,010
And he's German.

2615
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:53,010
And like...

2616
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:02,390
He is German.

2617
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,510
Locally source.

2618
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:11,230
He's Gunther Von Higgins.

2619
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:13,230
And he is an eccentric billionaire.

2620
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:15,250
And...

2621
01:40:16,730 --> 01:40:17,850
He said...

2622
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:20,130
Propond villain to your name.

2623
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:25,810
There were roughly a thousand to one human bones found buried under Benjamin Franklin's house.

2624
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:26,630
Thank you.

2625
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:27,930
I...

2626
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:28,610
Like, because I...

2627
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:30,210
My parents brought me...

2628
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:31,050
Brought me to see.

2629
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:33,030
Because they're like, oh, this is so interesting.

2630
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:35,290
Because it's a traveling exhibit.

2631
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:41,350
It's a worldwide traveling exhibit.

2632
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:45,470
And I thought it was like a medical museum thing.

2633
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:52,770
You know, like a museum dedicated to, like, medical studies and, like, research.

2634
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:56,770
But it's just a private collection owned by this man.

2635
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:00,470
Because he's obsessed with plasticine.

2636
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:04,290
He's obsessed with, like, putting things...

2637
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:05,670
Like, preserving things.

2638
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:17,710
Because he was the one that invented the technique to preserve biological tissue.

2639
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,850
Because he invented it.

2640
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:23,470
So he has a fucking private collection of this.

2641
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:24,670
So I'm like...

2642
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:29,290
Yes, that man actually invented it.

2643
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:32,090
No way.

2644
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:40,010
Like, that shit blew my mind.

2645
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:43,310
Because I was like...

2646
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:43,570
Alright.

2647
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:45,670
Gotta take my fucking chest.

2648
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:48,310
Wait, did that fall out from my chest?

2649
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:49,910
Oh my god.

2650
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:50,850
A medallion?

2651
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:54,830
Oh, I can't even fucking verify this.

2652
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:57,510
That is...

2653
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:58,810
Lord is crazy.

2654
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:06,290
He invented it and perfected it.

2655
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:15,090
Look at my...

2656
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:16,830
Jurassic Park.

2657
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:17,810
I'm a people.

2658
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:19,630
Mr. Broken Vaughn.

2659
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:20,850
Thank you for the super chat.

2660
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:21,310
Thank you.

2661
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:21,830
Thank you.

2662
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:23,630
That shit, like, blew my mind.

2663
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:25,070
I was not...

2664
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:26,050
Oh wait, it's closed.

2665
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:28,630
I was not expecting that extra lore.

2666
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:29,490
You know what I mean?

2667
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:30,170
I saw it.

2668
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:32,890
Because I don't know.

2669
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:35,310
You think that it was like an actual...

2670
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:37,110
Like, you think it was a fucking museum.

2671
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:39,430
Like...

2672
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:43,490
Said it's owned by some fucking crazy billionaire.

2673
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:47,810
Alright.

2674
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:50,150
Let's put this...

2675
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:50,870
One day.

2676
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:51,950
I'm almost there, guys.

2677
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:54,430
I'm only $101 away.

2678
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:56,530
Oh my god.

2679
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:58,010
I need to figure out how to fuck.

2680
01:42:58,750 --> 01:42:59,230
Okay.

2681
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:01,430
And then I will be able to sell my chest.

2682
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:07,290
I'll be able to sell this soon.

2683
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:13,970
Oh, Papa Smurf.

2684
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:15,090
Thank you for the super chat.

2685
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:15,550
Thank you.

2686
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:16,310
Thank you.

2687
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:19,490
Alright.

2688
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:20,270
Let's go home.

2689
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:21,630
It's time for...

2690
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:23,130
It's time to go home now.

2691
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:24,230
Yay.

2692
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:27,670
Yay.

2693
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:32,610
Wait.

2694
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:33,270
Is this home?

2695
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:34,030
This is home.

2696
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:35,130
I know.

2697
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:35,850
You know what?

2698
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:37,010
We made like, what?

2699
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,710
At least $10 profit.

2700
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:39,650
Look.

2701
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:40,750
We didn't go broke.

2702
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:41,850
That's all that matters.

2703
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:43,590
We didn't lose money, guys.

2704
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,730
That's all that matters.

2705
01:43:44,990 --> 01:43:47,130
As long as we're still making money...

2706
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,050
Eventually, I'll have my big break.

2707
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:53,750
I'll have my big break.

2708
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:57,730
And then I can...

2709
01:43:57,730 --> 01:43:59,490
I got a medallion, though.

2710
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:00,950
I got a medallion.

2711
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:02,930
So that means...

2712
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:04,470
That's big ass money right there.

2713
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:06,490
I just need to be able to verify it later.

2714
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:07,950
But I can't afford that yet.

2715
01:44:08,370 --> 01:44:09,750
So I'll save it up.

2716
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:14,040
How do I buy up?

2717
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:15,240
It doesn't say how I can buy up.

2718
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:15,660
Look at that.

2719
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:16,340
I got $87.

2720
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:18,740
Look at that.

2721
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:22,460
No, it still says the tools are not available to me.

2722
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,620
I got $82.

2723
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:29,460
That's profit right there.

2724
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,160
It's still week one.

2725
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:35,140
I don't have to pay rent yet.

2726
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:38,840
No, it won't let me verify it at stores.

2727
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:39,820
They're like...

2728
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:40,580
They're like...

2729
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:42,620
Oh, we don't know what that is.

2730
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:44,440
We're slowly getting...

2731
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:46,220
We're surviving in this economy.

2732
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:47,720
This harsh ass economy.

2733
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,920
The Pokemon bubble burst.

2734
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,140
So this is what I have to do now.

2735
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:57,080
Alright.

2736
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:57,900
Here I go.

2737
01:45:05,310 --> 01:45:06,870
Also, by the way...

2738
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:08,370
I forgot to mention...

2739
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:10,510
Regarding the lingerie story...

2740
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:10,990
I...

2741
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:14,070
I changed my address for it.

2742
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:15,650
So it doesn't go to my old place.

2743
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:17,290
If it happens again.

2744
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:20,450
Because I am not paying a $20 Uber again.

2745
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:21,470
I am...

2746
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:26,470
If you're gonna send me weird shit...

2747
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:28,730
I do not want an Uber $20.

2748
01:45:35,770 --> 01:45:36,810
Wait, hold up.

2749
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:37,570
What happened?

2750
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:38,010
Okay.

2751
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:39,750
Check the beginning of the stream.

2752
01:45:40,230 --> 01:45:40,830
Check this...

2753
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:45,330
Okay.

2754
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:46,510
Tldr.

2755
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:47,850
For those who are like...

2756
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:48,670
What the fuck happened?

2757
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:50,590
If you missed out the beginning of the stream.

2758
01:45:51,150 --> 01:45:51,550
A dragon...

2759
01:45:53,150 --> 01:45:54,050
Reminded me...

2760
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:55,070
That I had a...

2761
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:56,110
A throne account.

2762
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:59,070
And sent a surprise gift over...

2763
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:00,070
To my old place.

2764
01:46:02,590 --> 01:46:03,070
Right.

2765
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:03,730
Thank you.

2766
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:04,710
Thank you for the rain.

2767
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:05,190
Thank you.

2768
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:06,050
Thank you.

2769
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,610
I'm storage hunting right now.

2770
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,650
I've won every auction...

2771
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:11,470
So far.

2772
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:12,950
I'm winning.

2773
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:16,310
That's right.

2774
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:17,830
Get out of here, Abigail.

2775
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:20,090
This is my fucking storage.

2776
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:27,910
I saw an N64 underneath that shelf.

2777
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:32,710
What the fuck, Mateo?

2778
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:34,070
You own a suit.

2779
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:35,230
You don't need this.

2780
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:39,950
I'm living paycheck by paycheck.

2781
01:46:43,150 --> 01:46:45,990
Abigail, go back to your fucking suburban house.

2782
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:47,590
Find another hobby.

2783
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,810
Your kids missed you.

2784
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:53,170
Alright, nice.

2785
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:53,590
I won.

2786
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:55,010
Yeah.

2787
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:58,390
I got it.

2788
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:00,850
I know there's an N64 here somewhere.

2789
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:01,750
Alright.

2790
01:47:01,990 --> 01:47:03,470
I have a chemical vessel.

2791
01:47:04,190 --> 01:47:04,650
Okay.

2792
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:05,350
What the fuck?

2793
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:06,390
I need a level 2.

2794
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:08,030
A chemical container.

2795
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:08,970
Oh my god.

2796
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:10,650
Were they making crystal?

2797
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:15,790
What are all these chemical shit?

2798
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:18,270
A constellation poster.

2799
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:19,230
Oh my god.

2800
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:20,770
They made it on this dishwasher.

2801
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:21,430
$78.

2802
01:47:21,570 --> 01:47:22,050
Okay.

2803
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:22,890
Nice.

2804
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:23,890
Alright.

2805
01:47:24,830 --> 01:47:26,510
This has to be worth something.

2806
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:27,390
$30.

2807
01:47:27,830 --> 01:47:28,010
Okay.

2808
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:29,610
There is another chest.

2809
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:32,350
We can also cook too.

2810
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:33,590
Alright.

2811
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:36,190
I found Walter's stash.

2812
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:38,090
Alright.

2813
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:39,830
Which one was the chest with stuff?

2814
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,590
It was this one.

2815
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:40,810
No.

2816
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:41,830
Okay.

2817
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:43,370
It was this one.

2818
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:43,730
Okay.

2819
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:45,290
This has a toy train.

2820
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:47,570
And...

2821
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:48,510
A medallion.

2822
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:48,870
Okay.

2823
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:50,550
That's fine.

2824
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:51,510
We have...

2825
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:51,970
Oh my god.

2826
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:53,470
They need level 2.

2827
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:55,290
That's fine.

2828
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:59,090
Transport this chest.

2829
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:01,410
Alright.

2830
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:03,170
Alright.

2831
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:04,630
We're almost there at...

2832
01:48:04,630 --> 01:48:05,970
We almost make back the money.

2833
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:07,130
$248.

2834
01:48:08,890 --> 01:48:09,670
Flash grenade.

2835
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:10,630
Oh my god.

2836
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:10,910
Okay.

2837
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:11,810
The collector...

2838
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:13,430
Oh, the collector would want this.

2839
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:13,830
Alright.

2840
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:14,670
We have a grenade.

2841
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:16,670
Wait.

2842
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:17,990
Actually, a flash grenade.

2843
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:18,430
Wait.

2844
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:20,290
How much does the collector want?

2845
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:24,850
Nice bomb...

2846
01:48:24,850 --> 01:48:25,630
AK-47.

2847
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:26,330
Okay.

2848
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:27,890
He doesn't want a...

2849
01:48:27,890 --> 01:48:29,350
Flash grenade yet.

2850
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:30,930
But he will want it eventually.

2851
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:31,730
I'll keep it.

2852
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:32,170
For now.

2853
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,870
I'll put in my special chest.

2854
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:35,890
I have several of them.

2855
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:38,370
Special chest number one.

2856
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:40,570
I have a lot of special chests.

2857
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:40,990
Oh wait.

2858
01:48:41,810 --> 01:48:42,330
Actually...

2859
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:42,590
Okay.

2860
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:43,370
I can sell this.

2861
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:44,330
I forgot about the helmet.

2862
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:45,430
Alright.

2863
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:49,630
Throw it in for a little surprise.

2864
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:51,010
Okay.

2865
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,270
And then I have a chair.

2866
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:56,550
And a constellation poster.

2867
01:48:58,570 --> 01:48:59,050
Okay.

2868
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:00,370
I practically...

2869
01:49:00,370 --> 01:49:00,810
Look at that.

2870
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:02,070
I broke even...

2871
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,750
Oh look at that.

2872
01:49:02,890 --> 01:49:04,050
$2 profit.

2873
01:49:04,650 --> 01:49:04,950
Wait.

2874
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:06,290
$3 profit.

2875
01:49:06,430 --> 01:49:07,510
Look at me, mom.

2876
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:09,650
She said I'd be a disappointment.

2877
01:49:09,650 --> 01:49:10,610
But look at her.

2878
01:49:10,930 --> 01:49:12,990
I've made at least $6 today.

2879
01:49:13,610 --> 01:49:14,510
Look at that.

2880
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:16,850
I ain't no disappointment, mom.

2881
01:49:18,290 --> 01:49:20,270
Where's your $6 profit, huh?

2882
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:22,390
That's fucking right.

2883
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:23,550
No ice soap tonight.

2884
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:27,050
I can buy at least one chicken nuggy.

2885
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:31,710
Oh, $6.

2886
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:33,430
Let's go.

2887
01:49:38,110 --> 01:49:38,870
Alright.

2888
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:40,250
Let's put this in.

2889
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:42,910
Alright.

2890
01:49:44,770 --> 01:49:45,970
And then...

2891
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:47,250
What a deal.

2892
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:50,890
Yeah.

2893
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:52,350
Exactly.

2894
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:57,250
If you bid on every auction, eventually you'll hit it big.

2895
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:58,130
Guys.

2896
01:49:58,830 --> 01:50:00,730
I looked into that storage.

2897
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:01,570
Storage.

2898
01:50:01,830 --> 01:50:03,470
And I saw money, money, money.

2899
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:04,650
Look at that.

2900
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,650
The bigger the item, the more money you get.

2901
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:07,030
Look at that.

2902
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:08,230
I got a fucking dishwasher.

2903
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:12,950
That's the key to success, guys.

2904
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:15,810
Oh my god!

2905
01:50:17,190 --> 01:50:19,590
Got a family heirloom.

2906
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:20,770
Right there.

2907
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:23,850
From the 1700s.

2908
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:26,750
This necklace was worn by Abraham Lincoln's wife.

2909
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:28,770
Before he got shot.

2910
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:30,670
Look at that.

2911
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:33,010
Alright.

2912
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:34,030
Let's put this here.

2913
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:37,650
And then...

2914
01:50:37,650 --> 01:50:38,650
That's right.

2915
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:40,830
90% of gamblers quit before winning.

2916
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:41,810
Exactly.

2917
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:45,010
I think that's everything in that...

2918
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:45,950
In that thing.

2919
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:49,820
Alright.

2920
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:53,000
We'll take it over to the pawn shop.

2921
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:54,440
Let's go.

2922
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,040
The best I can do is $10.

2923
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:01,780
How about...

2924
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:02,820
How about $15?

2925
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:05,300
And you throw me in a...

2926
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:06,500
A chocolate bar.

2927
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:10,480
Alright.

2928
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:11,820
Buy my shit.

2929
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:14,260
Okay.

2930
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:15,380
Chemical vessel.

2931
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:16,120
Alright.

2932
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:17,220
We're gonna sell this.

2933
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:18,900
The necklace.

2934
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,960
He doesn't know the value of this.

2935
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:23,660
So I'm not selling that to him.

2936
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:24,740
And then...

2937
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:25,760
And then...

2938
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,520
I...

2939
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:38,540
Wait.

2940
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,680
Did I sold my box?

2941
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,320
Where's my chest?

2942
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:48,480
No!

2943
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:53,020
He took...

2944
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:54,440
How much did he give me?

2945
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:57,280
How much did he even give me?

2946
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:57,940
He...

2947
01:51:58,840 --> 01:51:59,480
No!

2948
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:03,790
No!

2949
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:04,810
That was my...

2950
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:08,610
Oh my god.

2951
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:11,010
How much did he even give me?

2952
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:13,210
He...

2953
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:13,850
Yoinked it!

2954
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:15,330
He stole it from me!

2955
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:18,750
He distracted me.

2956
01:52:20,110 --> 01:52:21,850
The world will never know.

2957
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:25,690
That would have been where the N64 was!

2958
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:29,070
That could have been the N64!

2959
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:32,650
Ma was right.

2960
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:38,330
The Papa Smurfs.

2961
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:39,530
Thank you for the super chat.

2962
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:39,870
Thank you.

2963
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:40,910
Thank you.

2964
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:41,630
Just let's do it.

2965
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,490
He's a cat.

2966
01:52:42,730 --> 01:52:44,450
Thank you for the super chat.

2967
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:44,930
Thank you.

2968
01:52:45,070 --> 01:52:45,350
Thank you.

2969
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:46,650
That's not true.

2970
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:48,390
Ma was never right.

2971
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:50,530
I'll make something of myself.

2972
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:52,170
Just you wait, Ma.

2973
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:54,410
Just you wait.

2974
01:52:57,450 --> 01:52:59,430
She doesn't know anything.

2975
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:06,500
Being a successful businesswoman takes day...

2976
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,100
Not take...

2977
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,240
Can't just happen overnight, guys.

2978
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,580
It takes months.

2979
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,020
Maybe even years.

2980
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,280
Alright.

2981
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:17,940
Don't worry.

2982
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,240
Don't worry.

2983
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,220
This next...

2984
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:21,260
This next...

2985
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:22,920
6 p.m.?

2986
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:26,040
I have to wait till 6 p.m.?

2987
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,200
Oh my god.

2988
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:30,960
Maybe I'll have...

2989
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:31,560
Okay, that's fine.

2990
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,760
I'll put my...

2991
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:33,820
My tre...

2992
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:34,780
In my treasures.

2993
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:35,940
My special treasure.

2994
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:37,200
Okay.

2995
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,660
I have...

2996
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:40,740
A toy...

2997
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:42,480
Okay, let's put like...

2998
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,000
Is there anything in this chest?

2999
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:45,600
Okay, there's nothing in this chest.

3000
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,020
We'll put all my...

3001
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:49,880
My special treasure in the big chest, though.

3002
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:52,140
Okay, this is my flash grenade.

3003
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,020
My little pink can.

3004
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:58,540
And these cool-ass stylish cowboy boots.

3005
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:59,220
Yeehaw.

3006
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:00,780
And then...

3007
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:01,980
I'll just put...

3008
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:02,700
Stack them up here.

3009
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,100
My family jewels.

3010
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:05,540
Oh my god.

3011
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,240
Can I put a chest within a chest?

3012
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:08,360
Oh my god.

3013
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,040
It's like those little Russian dolls.

3014
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,380
Oh my god.

3015
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,900
Now we're Tetris-ing, guys.

3016
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:21,300
Now we're playing real Tetris.

3017
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:22,360
And...

3018
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:28,020
Oh guys, I don't think I was supposed to...

3019
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,340
Yeah, I don't think it was meant...

3020
01:54:30,340 --> 01:54:30,700
It's alright.

3021
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,220
It wasn't meant to...

3022
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,240
This game does not like that.

3023
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,020
It's vibrate.

3024
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,740
Guys, eventually...

3025
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:46,460
Eventually, I'll complete my first mission.

3026
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,160
My first...

3027
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,000
The tutorial.

3028
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:55,200
I will complete this tutorial.

3029
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:58,400
It will happen.

3030
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:01,420
Alright.

3031
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:03,600
How the fuck are we gonna kill...

3032
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:04,360
Time?

3033
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:06,520
Oh my...

3034
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:06,960
That's it.

3035
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:07,320
I'm...

3036
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,040
No, I can't.

3037
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,600
I can't wait another day.

3038
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:11,840
Because then Rent's gonna show up.

3039
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:18,740
Guys, I can't wait another day or the Rent will go up.

3040
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,000
If I pay...

3041
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:21,920
Actually, maybe I can.

3042
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:22,980
Okay, that's it.

3043
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:24,020
No.

3044
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:26,780
Not the Rent.

3045
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:28,660
Anything but that.

3046
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:32,680
I can't believe there's only two storages.

3047
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:33,800
Hello?

3048
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:37,640
There has to be another storage for my Storage Wars.

3049
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:39,560
I'm addicted.

3050
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:42,220
There is one more.

3051
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,860
There is one more.

3052
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:46,900
It is all the way...

3053
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:47,700
Wait, where was it?

3054
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:49,220
Pawn shop.

3055
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:50,960
Taste of art.

3056
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,040
The West Pawn shop.

3057
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:54,280
Is that another storage war?

3058
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,040
I gotta go to the next town.

3059
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,040
I will do it.

3060
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:00,200
I'll go to the next town.

3061
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:02,620
That's it.

3062
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:06,320
That's how dedicated I am.

3063
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:08,960
I'll go to the next town over.

3064
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:10,920
For my Storage Wars.

3065
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:13,900
I need to storage my wars.

3066
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:17,000
Honey, please find a real job.

3067
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:19,040
This is my real job.

3068
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:22,180
Or will we go back to the Pookie Man days?

3069
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:26,640
Do you want me to get arrested again for fighting children?

3070
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,520
I can't go back.

3071
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:38,900
That's all right.

3072
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,860
Why don't you support my passion, wife?

3073
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,860
I mean, that was...

3074
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:48,640
That's all right.

3075
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,860
I'll go to the next town over.

3076
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:53,040
And win my Storage Wars.

3077
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:57,680
All right.

3078
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:00,020
They won't let me back at Walmart.

3079
01:57:03,860 --> 01:57:06,080
Some man was trying to film me.

3080
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:07,140
And I got mad.

3081
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:13,260
I am a reputable business owner.

3082
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,520
What did I do at Walmart?

3083
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,780
They had that new Eeveelution.

3084
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,480
Those like...

3085
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:25,200
Those new Eeveelution.

3086
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:27,460
Pokemon cards.

3087
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:33,180
And some little fucking brat trying to take them from me.

3088
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:38,000
All right.

3089
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:40,040
Small...

3090
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:40,640
Yeah, I know.

3091
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,140
Small businesses are the backbone of this country.

3092
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:43,760
Yeehaw.

3093
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,200
How dare they?

3094
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:52,840
How do we not know if that child was also a reseller, huh?

3095
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,500
How do we not know?

3096
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,120
Alright, this way.

3097
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:02,540
They come in all shapes and sizes.

3098
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:08,620
Where's my Storage Wars?

3099
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:10,860
Wait, they're not holding any...

3100
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:12,540
I literally drove to the next town.

3101
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,720
Where the fuck is my Storage Wars?

3102
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:20,120
Yeah, it could be some scalpers, child.

3103
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,420
Oh, shit.

3104
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:25,140
Blind auctions?

3105
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,040
Oh my god, just like my blind boxes.

3106
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,980
Oh my god, this is even better!

3107
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:33,060
Sign me up!

3108
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:35,480
Wait, this is even better!

3109
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:37,440
Oh my god, I'm gonna get my mystery box!

3110
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:38,500
Let's go!

3111
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:46,960
Oh my god, $500 mystery boxes, you know those?

3112
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:49,300
Oh my god, 500...

3113
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:50,640
Get me in there.

3114
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:51,880
600?

3115
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,840
That's right, I have just enough.

3116
01:58:55,580 --> 01:58:56,980
Oh, I don't.

3117
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,040
$991,000?!

3118
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:04,800
The gambling story.

3119
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:07,980
You know, remember, like, I don't know if people still do this.

3120
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:12,760
But those, like, um, like, $500 to $1,000...

3121
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:15,180
Yeah, of course, of course, I don't have $1,000!

3122
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,440
Stupid Miguel.

3123
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:18,100
They're richer.

3124
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:28,000
Remember, like, those, like, eBay auctions where it's, like, $500 mystery boxes, haunted mystery boxes?

3125
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:31,860
And, like, YouTubers used to buy, like, these boxes to unbox.

3126
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:35,740
Um, and there's, like, this, this mystery box is actually haunted!

3127
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:42,180
You guys remember back then on YouTube, they did that shit?

3128
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:47,420
Yeah, the, yeah, the deep web mystery box era.

3129
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:50,500
I got this.

3130
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:54,020
It's sport category!

3131
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:58,520
I have enough.

3132
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:00,720
Oh, my God!

3133
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:08,170
Oh, my God!

3134
02:00:08,450 --> 02:00:08,550
I'm...

3135
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:09,070
I'm...

3136
02:00:09,070 --> 02:00:11,270
I'm not rich enough for the blind boxes!

3137
02:00:11,730 --> 02:00:14,430
Even the auctioneer is more fancy!

3138
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:15,550
He...

3139
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:18,530
Look at the auctioneer!

3140
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:20,950
He's wearing a cowboy hat!

3141
02:00:21,310 --> 02:00:23,050
He knows what's up!

3142
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:28,590
We're too poor to play in the big leagues!

3143
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:31,330
This is the fucking big leagues!

3144
02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:32,950
I can't afford it!

3145
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:38,040
Come on!

3146
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:40,480
It's military grade!

3147
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:42,660
Oh, my God!

3148
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:44,000
Matteo!

3149
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:49,460
I remember, like, there's, like, people that actually, like, sent in, like...

3150
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:51,020
They already went to a thousand?!

3151
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:55,400
The big...

3152
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,920
Bro, they're all so fancy!

3153
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,880
This guy's wearing Beats by Dr. Dre headphones!

3154
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:03,260
All I have is the one I got from...

3155
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:04,320
From Walmart!

3156
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:09,700
Bro, that guy seems...

3157
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:11,900
He's, like, Rudy the streamer on Twitch.

3158
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:13,160
This guy...

3159
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:14,440
He's, like...

3160
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:15,000
Yeah, I'm a...

3161
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,380
I'm a live streamer on Twitch.tv.

3162
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:18,260
Like...

3163
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,120
You know that guy is a billionaire!

3164
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:23,160
Look at his aura!

3165
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:25,840
I'm out of my tent!

3166
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:26,900
I...

3167
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:29,880
I shouldn't even be in this city!

3168
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:33,340
I'm going back to my small town!

3169
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,220
In Albuquerque!

3170
02:01:36,220 --> 02:01:36,680
Turkey!

3171
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,460
Oh, no!

3172
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,400
And I need gas!

3173
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:47,460
Okay, that's fine.

3174
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,060
Yeah, he streamed all this, too.

3175
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:53,480
I'm not...

3176
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:56,640
I'm not even in the same tax bracket!

3177
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:00,100
Get me out of here!

3178
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:01,400
Yo-oh-oh!

3179
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:04,680
I need to get gas!

3180
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:13,220
Go back to poor vill!

3181
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:20,340
All right, let's get the gas.

3182
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:24,280
I hope the gas isn't too expensive... here.

3183
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,820
Where you belong.

3184
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:36,860
Okay, the gas is not that bad.

3185
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:40,500
All right, at least the gas is not that bad.

3186
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:42,900
All right, don't worry.

3187
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:45,440
I'll show them.

3188
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:47,460
I'll show them all.

3189
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:53,640
I'll show them.

3190
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:59,340
I'll be able to afford your stupid blind boxes.

3191
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:02,080
Life is hard.

3192
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:11,220
I'll be a thousand dollar person only.

3193
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:12,660
I'll have a thousand... okay.

3194
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,160
I'll have a thousand dollars and I'll show them all.

3195
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:19,140
One day!

3196
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:24,760
I'm Solid Snake.

3197
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,300
Thank you for the super chat.

3198
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:26,740
Thank you.

3199
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:27,540
Thank you.

3200
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:35,120
Like Lil Doki, we're selling extra cards to people and then... lol, it's a... it's a cycle.

3201
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:37,140
I'll be a thousandaire!

3202
02:03:37,420 --> 02:03:37,900
Yeah!

3203
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:40,940
Then you'll all pay!

3204
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:44,300
Kel, thank you for the super chat.

3205
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:44,780
Thank you.

3206
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,580
Thank you.

3207
02:03:45,580 --> 02:03:46,720
That's right!

3208
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,320
I bet you haven't seen someone who owns a thousand dollars before!

3209
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:55,220
Well, I guess I'll wait.

3210
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:56,760
I'll wait.

3211
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,200
Then you'll see!

3212
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:08,400
And I don't trust no banks, so I'll just hide it all underneath my bed sheets.

3213
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,240
They'll never know!

3214
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:16,440
I don't need no banks!

3215
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:19,200
I don't trust those bankers!

3216
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:24,360
Just hide... and then I invested...

3217
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:26,060
And then I invested in gold!

3218
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:29,860
Cause gold... the value of gold will never devalue!

3219
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:31,980
They'll never lose its value!

3220
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:33,940
Alright.

3221
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:36,760
Okay, here it is.

3222
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:44,870
Oh my god.

3223
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:49,370
I think... that coke...

3224
02:04:49,370 --> 02:04:51,950
Oh my god, there's a little... there's a gift box in there!

3225
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:54,010
Oh my... there's two chests!

3226
02:04:54,450 --> 02:04:55,090
Let's go!

3227
02:04:55,310 --> 02:04:55,990
I'm ready!

3228
02:04:56,930 --> 02:04:58,270
I'm ready to bid!

3229
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:01,190
There's treasures!

3230
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:02,410
And a pumpkin!

3231
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:06,290
There's so many mystery boxes!

3232
02:05:08,210 --> 02:05:09,630
Get outta here!

3233
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:16,020
I waited six hours for this!

3234
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:18,200
I'm locked in!

3235
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:19,160
Okay!

3236
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,500
Amber, you're here too?!

3237
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:27,180
Don't you have enough?!

3238
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:32,040
What are you doing?!

3239
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:32,860
Leave!

3240
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:34,240
Go back to your city!

3241
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:36,320
Go back...

3242
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:37,060
Go back...

3243
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:38,480
Go back to your city, Amber!

3244
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:39,980
Go back to your city, Amber!

3245
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:42,320
I need this!

3246
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:43,500
Alright.

3247
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,620
Okay, we have our chest here.

3248
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:47,140
Okay.

3249
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:48,400
I'm gonna sell this.

3250
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:50,340
I have a Christmas present.

3251
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:51,920
That is a little sad...

3252
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:53,400
That's 57 dollars!

3253
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:54,660
Oh my god!

3254
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:56,480
And a Valentine's present!

3255
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,600
Let's fucking go!

3256
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:00,180
Okay, there is a 98 dollar shelf.

3257
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:01,340
An 82!

3258
02:06:01,700 --> 02:06:02,460
Oh my god!

3259
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,820
I'm making bake!

3260
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:04,740
And a heater?!

3261
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:06,820
Okay.

3262
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:08,320
So these...

3263
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:09,500
And then...

3264
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:10,700
A beach soda can.

3265
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:12,600
For 34 dollars?!

3266
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:15,700
Oh my god!

3267
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:16,800
Is this Coca-Cola?!

3268
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:20,520
The very first time Coca-Cola was ever bottled up!

3269
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:21,400
Like...

3270
02:06:24,340 --> 02:06:26,620
The very first time!

3271
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:29,740
When they were made from real sugar canes!

3272
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:30,520
The...

3273
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:31,720
The crystal...

3274
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:33,300
Yeah, it's Crystal Pepsi!

3275
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:36,560
The original Coke with cocaine in it!

3276
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:43,120
The first edition!

3277
02:06:43,580 --> 02:06:44,940
Oh my god!

3278
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:48,600
And a Coca-Cola with Coke!

3279
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:49,800
Alright!

3280
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:53,540
I'm gonna sell someone's fucking Christmas present too!

3281
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:55,340
What even is in there?!

3282
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,900
I'm gonna sell my mystery!

3283
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,380
My blind box right here!

3284
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,760
Age like wine!

3285
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:06,460
My Valentine's Day!

3286
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:08,780
And Christmas blind boxes!

3287
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:10,440
Oh my god!

3288
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:12,000
I'm gonna make so much money!

3289
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:13,820
I miss...

3290
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:14,240
Oh my...

3291
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:15,260
Remember the loot box date?

3292
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:15,920
Like the...

3293
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:16,640
The actual...

3294
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:17,860
Loot Crate days!

3295
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:20,840
When loot crate was a fucking thing!

3296
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,600
There's no way loot crate is like...

3297
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,260
A sustainable business model now!

3298
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:27,240
I feel like...

3299
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,580
I feel like...

3300
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:28,860
That...

3301
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:31,960
People have finally realized that it's mostly junk!

3302
02:07:32,380 --> 02:07:32,700
Like...

3303
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:34,980
I used to be a loot crate subscriber!

3304
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:36,200
Um...

3305
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:36,840
Because like...

3306
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:38,760
Every YouTuber fucking showed that shit!

3307
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,720
And I was like...

3308
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:40,420
Oh my god!

3309
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:41,700
That...

3310
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:42,840
That seems so cool!

3311
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:45,020
It's like a little present every month!

3312
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:48,380
I fell for it!

3313
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:50,000
I was one of those...

3314
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:50,700
I was like...

3315
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:51,880
She fell for it!

3316
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:52,820
And I wore it!

3317
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,060
But it's just a way for people...

3318
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:58,280
For like companies to get rid of extra stock!

3319
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,520
So you see like...

3320
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:00,400
People doing like...

3321
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:01,320
Mystery bags!

3322
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:01,760
Or like...

3323
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:02,380
Mystery boxes!

3324
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:03,360
Like...

3325
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,120
At anime convention!

3326
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:04,740
It's just...

3327
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:06,200
I'm trying to get rid of like...

3328
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:06,600
Extra stock!

3329
02:08:06,660 --> 02:08:07,620
That people don't want!

3330
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:08,980
And that was me!

3331
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:10,280
She fell for it again!

3332
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:11,600
Alright!

3333
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:18,560
I think that pushes me a thousand!

3334
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:20,220
I'm pretty sure!

3335
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:23,740
I think this is it!

3336
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:26,520
I am finally gonna own a thousand dollars!

3337
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:30,540
What if I make a loot box?

3338
02:08:30,780 --> 02:08:32,400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3339
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:33,520
A mystery...

3340
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:34,680
...box!

3341
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:36,260
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3342
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:39,760
Alright!

3343
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:41,900
So that...

3344
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:43,820
The Doki box!

3345
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:44,300
Exactly!

3346
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:45,760
Okay!

3347
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:47,420
So this...

3348
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:47,760
This...

3349
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:48,940
Okay!

3350
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,260
And then we keep our box!

3351
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:51,960
And then we'll drive to the locksmith!

3352
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:55,240
Alright!

3353
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:00,220
Get over here!

3354
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:02,060
I'm so close!

3355
02:09:02,060 --> 02:09:03,180
I need fifty dollars!

3356
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,600
Open my box!

3357
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,040
Twenty dollars!

3358
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:09,540
It's fine!

3359
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,520
Alright!

3360
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:14,400
This is it!

3361
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:17,480
I think the moment I sell the shelf and the table...

3362
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:19,540
I'll finally own a thousand dollars!

3363
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:20,500
That is my goal!

3364
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:22,420
That is literally my goal today!

3365
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,440
The moment I own that thousand dollars!

3366
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:29,140
I'll be the one to laugh last!

3367
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:33,700
Alright!

3368
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:36,300
Okay!

3369
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:37,820
This game, not gonna lie, is pretty addicting!

3370
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:39,780
Ha ha ha ha!

3371
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:40,860
Ha ha ha ha!

3372
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:42,580
See, this is exactly why I don't play gotcha!

3373
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:44,420
Ha ha ha ha!

3374
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:46,120
I...

3375
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:46,960
Had a...

3376
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,160
A problem...

3377
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:48,980
With loot box...

3378
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:50,340
Loot boxes and mystery...

3379
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:53,520
I actually have a problem with mystery boxes and gotcha...

3380
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,620
And blind boxes and...

3381
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:55,540
And...

3382
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,020
Ha ha ha!

3383
02:09:56,220 --> 02:09:57,180
With IRL!

3384
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:57,720
Gotcha!

3385
02:09:58,280 --> 02:09:58,740
I...

3386
02:09:58,740 --> 02:09:59,660
Ha ha ha ha!

3387
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:01,440
Ha ha ha!

3388
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:02,160
Ah!

3389
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,120
Okay, it's fine!

3390
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:04,000
It's fine!

3391
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:05,260
I think if I...

3392
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:06,760
If I actually...

3393
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:07,520
Did like a...

3394
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:09,240
A bid at a storage...

3395
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:10,560
A storage hunter thing...

3396
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:11,960
Um...

3397
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:13,660
I think I'd...

3398
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:15,360
I think I'd actually do it!

3399
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:15,500
I...

3400
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:17,420
I actually...

3401
02:10:17,420 --> 02:10:18,820
I'll actually do it!

3402
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:19,200
Like...

3403
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:20,340
I actually wanna go to...

3404
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:21,660
NOOOOO!

3405
02:10:29,790 --> 02:10:30,970
My dog!

3406
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:37,220
Right in my face!

3407
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:38,440
No!

3408
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:42,540
No!

3409
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:44,360
I can't fit the chest!

3410
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:46,340
Okay, we gotta figure out how to fit the chest in!

3411
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:47,040
We gotta...

3412
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:49,140
He taps the side!

3413
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:50,580
He...

3414
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:52,120
NOOOOO!

3415
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,800
This one's gonna be it!

3416
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,420
This one's gonna be it!

3417
02:10:57,560 --> 02:10:58,120
How...

3418
02:10:58,120 --> 02:10:59,420
How do we...

3419
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:00,980
Oh my god!

3420
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,300
How am I gonna fit this?

3421
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:03,220
Okay!

3422
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:04,580
We can figure this out!

3423
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:06,200
Oh my god!

3424
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:07,940
I cannot fit two chests...

3425
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:08,860
At once!

3426
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:09,900
Okay!

3427
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:12,540
This is fine!

3428
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:14,460
We gotta figure this Tetris out!

3429
02:11:14,700 --> 02:11:16,600
So I can keep everything, guys!

3430
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:17,640
Okay!

3431
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,280
I put it now in here!

3432
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:21,200
Maybe it'll work!

3433
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:23,640
As long as it doesn't explode in...

3434
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:24,760
Outside of the box!

3435
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:26,300
It should be fine!

3436
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:30,840
Bum ba da dum ba da bum ba da dum ba...

3437
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:31,580
Oh no!

3438
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:33,640
It's exploding outside of the box, guys!

3439
02:11:33,860 --> 02:11:34,460
It's not working!

3440
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:35,640
It's not...

3441
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:36,320
Working!

3442
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:39,860
I can't put a chest within a chest!

3443
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:42,340
The game engine won't let me!

3444
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:46,220
Oh no!

3445
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:46,320
No!

3446
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:47,180
Okay!

3447
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:48,220
Okay!

3448
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:48,580
It's fine!

3449
02:11:52,340 --> 02:11:52,860
Alright!

3450
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:53,540
This is it!

3451
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:55,480
And then...

3452
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:57,140
I'll put this here!

3453
02:11:57,480 --> 02:11:57,600
Okay!

3454
02:11:57,640 --> 02:11:59,160
We have to put both of the...

3455
02:11:59,160 --> 02:11:59,340
Okay!

3456
02:11:59,380 --> 02:12:00,840
We'll put the small chest last!

3457
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:02,800
And then...

3458
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,200
Put this here!

3459
02:12:04,460 --> 02:12:05,800
And then we'll put...

3460
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,880
The bigger chest...

3461
02:12:10,210 --> 02:12:10,930
Bigger chest...

3462
02:12:10,930 --> 02:12:11,470
Oh my god!

3463
02:12:11,550 --> 02:12:11,810
Please!

3464
02:12:12,430 --> 02:12:13,430
We'll put this here!

3465
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:13,510
There!

3466
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:16,670
And then...

3467
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:19,050
Please!

3468
02:12:19,390 --> 02:12:19,850
Fit!

3469
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:21,970
And then...

3470
02:12:21,970 --> 02:12:23,390
We will put...

3471
02:12:24,150 --> 02:12:25,370
The shelf...

3472
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:26,170
Right here!

3473
02:12:26,330 --> 02:12:26,470
Oh!

3474
02:12:26,570 --> 02:12:27,130
This is perfect!

3475
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:28,630
And then...

3476
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:31,530
We will put...

3477
02:12:31,530 --> 02:12:33,230
The table...

3478
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:35,330
On top of the shelf!

3479
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:36,570
On top of the shelf!

3480
02:12:36,850 --> 02:12:37,590
Oh my god!

3481
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:38,210
This is perfect!

3482
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:39,010
We're Tetris-ing!

3483
02:12:39,750 --> 02:12:40,810
And then...

3484
02:12:40,810 --> 02:12:41,670
Oh my god!

3485
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:43,070
We'll put...

3486
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:45,470
Right here!

3487
02:12:45,690 --> 02:12:45,910
Oh!

3488
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:46,490
It's perfect!

3489
02:12:46,890 --> 02:12:47,430
There we go!

3490
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:48,670
We did it!

3491
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:50,390
It's perfect!

3492
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:51,150
It's so safe!

3493
02:12:51,370 --> 02:12:53,470
It's not gonna file a destination to anybody!

3494
02:12:53,810 --> 02:12:54,990
This is so safe!

3495
02:13:00,630 --> 02:13:01,850
We did it!

3496
02:13:02,310 --> 02:13:04,070
The Tetris is paying off!

3497
02:13:04,410 --> 02:13:04,970
I knew!

3498
02:13:05,090 --> 02:13:06,970
Instead of paying attention to the map...

3499
02:13:06,970 --> 02:13:07,430
And play...

3500
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:08,850
And play Tetris friends!

3501
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:10,570
Was a good idea!

3502
02:13:13,050 --> 02:13:13,650
Alright!

3503
02:13:15,010 --> 02:13:16,250
Wait, is it gonna close?

3504
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:18,270
Is he open for like the rest?

3505
02:13:18,270 --> 02:13:19,270
Is he 24 hours?

3506
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:20,950
I know you're in there!

3507
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:22,370
Let me in!

3508
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:24,890
Let me in!

3509
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:26,070
I'm like on the...

3510
02:13:26,070 --> 02:13:27,250
It's like that video...

3511
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:27,570
I don't know...

3512
02:13:27,570 --> 02:13:28,650
Is that TikTok video?

3513
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:29,650
And...

3514
02:13:29,650 --> 02:13:31,010
Where he's like...

3515
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:32,250
And the window is like...

3516
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:33,130
Let me in!

3517
02:13:33,170 --> 02:13:34,170
I see you!

3518
02:13:34,410 --> 02:13:35,610
Let me in!

3519
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:40,290
That's like McDonald's or some shit!

3520
02:13:47,030 --> 02:13:47,650
Alright...

3521
02:13:50,690 --> 02:13:51,210
No!

3522
02:13:51,450 --> 02:13:51,490
No!

3523
02:13:51,650 --> 02:13:51,730
No!

3524
02:13:51,730 --> 02:13:51,790
No!

3525
02:13:51,830 --> 02:13:52,110
Not the...

3526
02:13:52,110 --> 02:13:53,090
Not the Eric Andre!

3527
02:13:53,210 --> 02:13:53,930
Like an actual...

3528
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:54,930
There's an actual video!

3529
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:57,050
There's an old ass video!

3530
02:13:57,090 --> 02:13:58,310
Of some guy!

3531
02:13:58,630 --> 02:14:00,610
Like knocking on the McDonald's!

3532
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:01,970
And he's like...

3533
02:14:01,970 --> 02:14:02,650
He's like...

3534
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:03,290
Let me...

3535
02:14:03,290 --> 02:14:03,690
Like...

3536
02:14:03,690 --> 02:14:04,090
Oh my god!

3537
02:14:04,270 --> 02:14:04,490
Please!

3538
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:05,530
Please sir!

3539
02:14:05,790 --> 02:14:06,230
Please!

3540
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:06,870
Please!

3541
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:07,230
I...

3542
02:14:11,090 --> 02:14:11,690
I...

3543
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:12,930
Alright...

3544
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:13,630
Wait...

3545
02:14:13,630 --> 02:14:14,150
Where is it?

3546
02:14:14,350 --> 02:14:15,170
This way!

3547
02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:16,210
This way!

3548
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:16,590
It's home!

3549
02:14:18,190 --> 02:14:18,790
Trucks...

3550
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:19,330
Trucks stuck!

3551
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:29,590
But there's like an old-ass video of some guy outside of McDonald's and he keeps like, he's like knocking on the window, like demanding the employees to let them in.

3552
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:31,370
That was an old-ass video.

3553
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,720
Alright, wait, where do I live?

3554
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:38,280
Oh, not this way.

3555
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:41,820
Alright, it's okay.

3556
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:44,380
The next day I'll be a thousand-aer there.

3557
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,300
The next day!

3558
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:48,720
Just you wait, Ma!

3559
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:51,020
You didn't believe in me, Ma!

3560
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:52,900
Just you wait!

3561
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,060
I'll show Darlene.

3562
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:04,720
She didn't go to the prom with me because she thought I was a loser.

3563
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:06,300
I'll show them all.

3564
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:11,360
Alright, nice.

3565
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:12,740
Look at that!

3566
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:14,900
$40 profit!

3567
02:15:15,380 --> 02:15:16,100
See Ma!

3568
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:17,540
I made money!

3569
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:24,580
Alright, that's why I can finally sell my...

3570
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:29,840
I can finally sell my tables.

3571
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:31,720
I'm $40 richer!

3572
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:32,900
Song's up!

3573
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:38,280
This is the song for a winner!

3574
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,460
But I don't know, then they'll regret.

3575
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:42,860
They'll regret it all.

3576
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:47,160
They said most likely to not succeed.

3577
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:48,940
I'll show them all.

3578
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:52,220
Oh, it's so close.

3579
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:54,580
Wait, what time does the fucking pawn shop open?

3580
02:15:56,600 --> 02:15:57,440
Just wait.

3581
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:58,320
Just wait.

3582
02:15:58,800 --> 02:15:59,600
I'll wait.

3583
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:00,420
I'll wait in my truck.

3584
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:01,820
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3585
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:02,400
I'll wait.

3586
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:09,820
I can wait in my truck until you open up!

3587
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:11,600
I'll be right back.

3588
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:13,520
I'm ready!

3589
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:15,240
Take my table!

3590
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:17,340
And then I can be a thousandaire there!

3591
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:20,100
Alright, this...

3592
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:21,940
This...

3593
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:24,260
This...

3594
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:24,980
There we go.

3595
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:27,000
I can buy a fixing tool!

3596
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:30,060
You can buy better tools for verifying...

3597
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:32,440
Fixing in the tools app.

3598
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:33,320
Oh my god!

3599
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:36,340
Two thousand!

3600
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:36,800
Okay!

3601
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:38,420
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

3602
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:39,920
I can buy a fixer, though.

3603
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:42,600
Yes!

3604
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:44,880
I can fix things!

3605
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:46,160
I can fix you!

3606
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:46,900
I...

3607
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:51,380
You guys, crazy, purple!

3608
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:52,880
Thank you for the super chat!

3609
02:18:53,060 --> 02:18:53,300
Thank you!

3610
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:56,060
I can fix you!

3611
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:58,060
Let's go!

3612
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:03,780
The tool is a gun?

3613
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:04,860
Wait, does it look like...

3614
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:05,640
No, it's not.

3615
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:06,940
Wait, is it?

3616
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:10,380
No, it's like those, like, barcode scanner shit.

3617
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:15,300
Don't worry.

3618
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:16,420
I'm gonna sign up.

3619
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:19,380
Okay.

3620
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:20,840
It's time!

3621
02:19:22,260 --> 02:19:23,040
It's time!

3622
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:24,280
I can fix stuff now!

3623
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:26,600
Open that...

3624
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:27,980
Open the storage!

3625
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:30,800
Oh my god, there's a chest there.

3626
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:33,160
Oh my god, there's a skateboard!

3627
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:36,760
That skateboard was used by Tony Hawk himself!

3628
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:38,340
I gotta win that.

3629
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:39,000
I can tell.

3630
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:41,320
I can tell that's a Tony Hawk skateboard.

3631
02:19:45,700 --> 02:19:46,680
Did you see it?

3632
02:19:46,680 --> 02:19:47,320
Okay.

3633
02:19:50,820 --> 02:19:51,460
Really?

3634
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:53,960
I know it is!

3635
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:56,280
It's from the Tony...

3636
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:56,920
Mr. Tony!

3637
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:00,240
That's right!

3638
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:01,940
Yeah!

3639
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:03,760
Get out of there, Kate!

3640
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:04,080
That...

3641
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:04,920
Oh my god, Leo?

3642
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:07,720
As in like...

3643
02:20:08,460 --> 02:20:08,780
Wait!

3644
02:20:09,300 --> 02:20:10,160
Isn't that...

3645
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:12,860
I like how it actually sort of looks like him.

3646
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,980
He's just there for the fun of it.

3647
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:28,140
He's just people watching.

3648
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:31,780
That's right.

3649
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:33,040
I have nothing to lose!

3650
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:36,020
Doki, this is an intervention.

3651
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:37,440
You have a problem.

3652
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:38,180
Push.

3653
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:39,300
Thank you for the super chat.

3654
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:39,760
Thank you.

3655
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:40,580
Thank you.

3656
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:44,900
You know there's like people who are like...

3657
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:45,400
Like...

3658
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:46,960
There's like people that...

3659
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:48,020
Sellers hire...

3660
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:49,560
To like...

3661
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:50,380
Or assholes.

3662
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:51,440
There's like assholes.

3663
02:20:51,580 --> 02:20:52,440
Or people who like...

3664
02:20:53,020 --> 02:20:53,440
Hire...

3665
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:55,260
Specific...

3666
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:56,620
Bidders.

3667
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:57,660
That whole...

3668
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:58,580
His whole job...

3669
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:59,600
Their whole job...

3670
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:00,340
Is to like...

3671
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:02,660
Artificially raise the price of an item.

3672
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:04,060
To make it seem more valuable.

3673
02:21:08,130 --> 02:21:09,270
Oh, I can fix you.

3674
02:21:09,750 --> 02:21:11,030
I need level 3?

3675
02:21:11,190 --> 02:21:12,570
For a fucking magazine?

3676
02:21:13,210 --> 02:21:14,330
Can I fix the hay?

3677
02:21:15,230 --> 02:21:16,170
Oh my god.

3678
02:21:16,350 --> 02:21:16,530
Guys.

3679
02:21:16,850 --> 02:21:18,010
Guys, this might be a...

3680
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:18,610
This is not...

3681
02:21:18,610 --> 02:21:19,190
Guys, don't worry.

3682
02:21:19,530 --> 02:21:20,070
Don't worry.

3683
02:21:21,130 --> 02:21:22,510
I can fix this cabinet.

3684
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:23,490
Don't worry.

3685
02:21:23,570 --> 02:21:24,210
I fixed it.

3686
02:21:24,330 --> 02:21:25,530
And it's now $36.

3687
02:21:28,090 --> 02:21:28,830
Don't worry.

3688
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:30,610
The Tony Hawk skateboard.

3689
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:34,690
The Tony Hawk skateboard is gonna change it all.

3690
02:21:36,730 --> 02:21:37,610
This is all.

3691
02:21:37,690 --> 02:21:38,930
It's gonna change it all.

3692
02:21:39,630 --> 02:21:41,490
This license plate from...

3693
02:21:41,490 --> 02:21:42,230
From...

3694
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:43,910
From Alaska.

3695
02:21:45,250 --> 02:21:46,790
That will change it all.

3696
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:51,330
Oh my.

3697
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:52,390
Don't worry guys.

3698
02:21:52,950 --> 02:21:56,210
This pad was clearly from the 1800s.

3699
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:57,810
During the Victorian era.

3700
02:21:59,070 --> 02:21:59,430
Guys.

3701
02:21:59,590 --> 02:22:00,170
In this chest.

3702
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:01,510
I bet you there is a...

3703
02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:03,370
I bet you there's a ring in there.

3704
02:22:06,930 --> 02:22:07,890
I believe.

3705
02:22:10,510 --> 02:22:12,330
Why is there a lock on that?

3706
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:13,430
How do I...

3707
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:15,430
Oh, is that the...

3708
02:22:15,430 --> 02:22:16,090
Did you see that?

3709
02:22:16,230 --> 02:22:17,590
What the fuck is that lock?

3710
02:22:18,250 --> 02:22:19,970
How do I open the lock?

3711
02:22:23,050 --> 02:22:23,810
It's fine.

3712
02:22:23,970 --> 02:22:24,890
Everything will be fine.

3713
02:22:26,770 --> 02:22:28,150
Everything will be fine.

3714
02:22:29,350 --> 02:22:30,330
It'll all be okay.

3715
02:22:30,930 --> 02:22:32,210
It'll all be okay.

3716
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:33,870
It's okay.

3717
02:22:34,050 --> 02:22:34,670
It's okay.

3718
02:22:34,670 --> 02:22:36,050
It'll all be okay.

3719
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:41,690
You can buy...

3720
02:22:41,690 --> 02:22:42,300
It's five...

3721
02:22:42,830 --> 02:22:43,830
Two thousand dollars.

3722
02:22:44,070 --> 02:22:45,390
I can't afford it yet.

3723
02:22:46,170 --> 02:22:46,990
Don't worry.

3724
02:22:47,170 --> 02:22:48,130
It'll all be okay.

3725
02:22:51,730 --> 02:22:52,730
Don't worry.

3726
02:22:54,250 --> 02:22:57,090
We'll be a thousand dollar near soon again.

3727
02:22:57,090 --> 02:22:57,710
Guys.

3728
02:22:58,370 --> 02:22:59,770
I have my tool.

3729
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:01,250
That I can fix things.

3730
02:23:03,270 --> 02:23:05,430
I can fix things now guys.

3731
02:23:08,450 --> 02:23:09,050
Guys.

3732
02:23:09,910 --> 02:23:11,290
My Tony Hawk skateboard.

3733
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:12,990
The value is just lost.

3734
02:23:13,130 --> 02:23:14,630
Because it's a little...

3735
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:16,370
Fucked up right now.

3736
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:17,510
It's a PSA 5.

3737
02:23:17,810 --> 02:23:18,450
But that's okay.

3738
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:21,530
Also PSA is a fucking scam.

3739
02:23:22,490 --> 02:23:23,990
Use the other grading system.

3740
02:23:24,270 --> 02:23:24,610
But anyway.

3741
02:23:24,710 --> 02:23:25,790
This is a PSA 5.

3742
02:23:25,790 --> 02:23:27,810
So that's why it's a little...

3743
02:23:27,810 --> 02:23:28,670
It's a little low.

3744
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:33,590
Alright.

3745
02:23:34,990 --> 02:23:35,970
For those who don't know.

3746
02:23:36,210 --> 02:23:37,730
PSA is like...

3747
02:23:37,730 --> 02:23:39,190
Not a great grading system.

3748
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:40,210
For trading cards.

3749
02:23:40,630 --> 02:23:41,830
Because it's actually like...

3750
02:23:41,830 --> 02:23:42,090
Low key.

3751
02:23:42,250 --> 02:23:42,650
I wanna...

3752
02:23:42,650 --> 02:23:43,950
Oh, I need two thousand dollars.

3753
02:23:44,550 --> 02:23:45,650
If I own the pawn shop.

3754
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:47,210
Does that mean like...

3755
02:23:47,210 --> 02:23:48,010
Like...

3756
02:23:48,010 --> 02:23:51,450
I don't have to worry about like...

3757
02:23:52,690 --> 02:23:53,210
Um...

3758
02:23:53,210 --> 02:23:54,290
I don't have to like...

3759
02:23:54,290 --> 02:23:55,430
Worry about like...

3760
02:23:55,430 --> 02:23:56,390
Selling things anymore.

3761
02:23:56,890 --> 02:23:57,410
Like...

3762
02:23:57,410 --> 02:23:58,430
Ha ha ha ha ha.

3763
02:23:59,750 --> 02:24:01,470
Apparently there's a better grading system.

3764
02:24:01,470 --> 02:24:02,670
That actually like...

3765
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:04,430
Tells you why they graded it like that.

3766
02:24:05,050 --> 02:24:05,510
Cause like...

3767
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:06,550
People were saying that like...

3768
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:07,050
The PSA...

3769
02:24:07,050 --> 02:24:07,970
For the PSA system.

3770
02:24:08,170 --> 02:24:10,630
They don't tell you why things are graded...

3771
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:11,710
Like certain ways.

3772
02:24:12,010 --> 02:24:13,830
And instead they just like...

3773
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:14,910
You can like...

3774
02:24:14,910 --> 02:24:15,870
Unpack the card.

3775
02:24:16,070 --> 02:24:16,710
And send it back.

3776
02:24:16,850 --> 02:24:17,630
If you think your card...

3777
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:19,510
If you got PSA 9.

3778
02:24:19,690 --> 02:24:20,790
And you think your card is a 10.

3779
02:24:21,130 --> 02:24:22,730
Some people have actually like...

3780
02:24:22,730 --> 02:24:23,810
Unpacked the card.

3781
02:24:24,250 --> 02:24:24,730
And like...

3782
02:24:25,230 --> 02:24:25,450
Uh...

3783
02:24:25,450 --> 02:24:25,930
Oh my god.

3784
02:24:25,970 --> 02:24:26,850
It's a hand sculpture.

3785
02:24:28,930 --> 02:24:29,370
Wait.

3786
02:24:29,470 --> 02:24:30,510
What the fuck do I do?

3787
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:32,310
How do I know there's a natural...

3788
02:24:32,310 --> 02:24:33,890
There isn't a natural hand there?

3789
02:24:34,670 --> 02:24:35,390
What the fuck?

3790
02:24:35,470 --> 02:24:36,210
I got like...

3791
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:37,910
Somebody's...

3792
02:24:38,370 --> 02:24:38,810
Pumpkin?

3793
02:24:40,230 --> 02:24:41,330
It's in the art.

3794
02:24:41,710 --> 02:24:42,790
I'm gonna take it to the museum.

3795
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:43,710
Wait a minute.

3796
02:24:44,150 --> 02:24:45,570
I'll take it to the museum.

3797
02:24:47,230 --> 02:24:48,290
Oh my god.

3798
02:24:48,730 --> 02:24:50,910
This is a rare find for the art gallery.

3799
02:24:53,190 --> 02:24:53,670
Okay.

3800
02:24:54,370 --> 02:24:55,470
Is the hand still in there?

3801
02:24:56,190 --> 02:24:56,690
Don't worry.

3802
02:24:57,310 --> 02:24:58,690
I'll show the snooty...

3803
02:24:58,690 --> 02:24:59,630
Rich fuckers.

3804
02:24:59,770 --> 02:25:00,610
In that city.

3805
02:25:01,430 --> 02:25:02,410
I'll show them.

3806
02:25:03,310 --> 02:25:04,630
I'll show them all.

3807
02:25:06,410 --> 02:25:07,910
I have real art.

3808
02:25:08,410 --> 02:25:09,230
Oh my god.

3809
02:25:10,610 --> 02:25:11,290
I'm stuck.

3810
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:13,650
Wait.

3811
02:25:13,790 --> 02:25:15,690
There's some like PSA systems now.

3812
02:25:15,910 --> 02:25:16,910
That can like...

3813
02:25:17,530 --> 02:25:18,010
Is it this?

3814
02:25:18,090 --> 02:25:18,170
No.

3815
02:25:18,230 --> 02:25:19,110
That's the archaeologist.

3816
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:20,730
Where's the art gallery?

3817
02:25:24,350 --> 02:25:24,750
Wait.

3818
02:25:24,810 --> 02:25:26,970
I knew there was an art gallery here.

3819
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:32,600
What is that make noise?

3820
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:35,440
Where did it go?

3821
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:36,400
Oh there it is.

3822
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:37,320
There it is.

3823
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:38,020
Oh there it is.

3824
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:38,620
There it is.

3825
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:40,560
Alright.

3826
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:40,980
But yeah.

3827
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:41,900
That actually like...

3828
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:43,740
You scan a QR code for it.

3829
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:44,940
And then they'll like...

3830
02:25:44,940 --> 02:25:46,460
Show you exactly like...

3831
02:25:46,460 --> 02:25:48,380
Why they gave you the grade that they've given you.

3832
02:25:53,720 --> 02:25:54,640
I'll show you.

3833
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:55,540
I have real art.

3834
02:25:56,260 --> 02:25:56,860
That's right.

3835
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:58,420
You snooty...

3836
02:25:58,420 --> 02:25:59,280
You snooty guys!

3837
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:00,420
Look down on me!

3838
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:01,980
But now I have art.

3839
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:05,620
I have art in my hands.

3840
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:11,240
I got a hand.

3841
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:13,040
A little hand.

3842
02:26:15,740 --> 02:26:17,820
I'll show you all.

3843
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:25,920
I'll show you all.

3844
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:27,780
Let's go.

3845
02:26:28,580 --> 02:26:29,380
Real art.

3846
02:26:30,580 --> 02:26:31,940
Man please.

3847
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:32,600
This is art.

3848
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:34,380
I got them's art.

3849
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:37,340
I bet you this hand was made.

3850
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:39,660
By the Leonardo Da Vinci.

3851
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,440
Alright, it's this way.

3852
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:52,680
Where is that art gallery?

3853
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:57,600
Now, I shall truly be a thousandaire!

3854
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:02,440
Hello!

3855
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:06,740
Miss art gallery own it!

3856
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:10,880
Oh, it's this way.

3857
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:16,870
Hello?

3858
02:27:17,390 --> 02:27:18,410
What have you got?

3859
02:27:18,730 --> 02:27:19,330
Wait.

3860
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,080
I got this.

3861
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:26,940
That's right.

3862
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:29,200
Real art.

3863
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:32,780
Verify.

3864
02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:35,000
That's right.

3865
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:37,760
Real ass art.

3866
02:27:38,180 --> 02:27:39,380
That's right.

3867
02:27:39,780 --> 02:27:45,160
You didn't think I would earn something as valuable as this.

3868
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:49,780
You look down from me because I live in Poresville.

3869
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:51,860
But look at me now.

3870
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:55,020
Look who's looking down on you now.

3871
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:57,080
Miss Snooty Miss Snoot.

3872
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:00,620
I have real ass art.

3873
02:28:05,500 --> 02:28:07,080
I can wait, guys.

3874
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:08,180
I can wait.

3875
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:09,600
Also, it's a very long drive back.

3876
02:28:09,740 --> 02:28:10,160
I don't want to...

3877
02:28:13,620 --> 02:28:15,500
I don't want to drive back.

3878
02:28:15,900 --> 02:28:17,600
It's so far away.

3879
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,720
It's so far.

3880
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:23,640
I can wait.

3881
02:28:25,420 --> 02:28:26,660
I feel like... No!

3882
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:27,520
No!

3883
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:32,660
It's... It's... The hand was sculpted from Leonardo da Vinci!

3884
02:28:34,660 --> 02:28:36,480
Um... He's, like, gay, right?

3885
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:38,080
Like, he... Right?

3886
02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:41,340
It was, like... I don't know if it's rumors or, like, true or not.

3887
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:43,700
He surrounded himself with a lot of...

3888
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:44,160
What have you got?

3889
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:46,060
Male assistants, like...

3890
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:51,640
What?

3891
02:28:52,020 --> 02:28:52,280
Oh, yeah.

3892
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:53,500
Apparently, there was a rumor...

3893
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:58,620
That, like... Um... That he's, like... He's, like, gay.

3894
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:00,020
So, like... I was gonna say...

3895
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:02,000
That hand was sculpted!

3896
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:06,280
Um... From one of his... Little boy... Little... Wait.

3897
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:06,480
No.

3898
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:06,660
No.

3899
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:07,040
Don't say that.

3900
02:29:08,020 --> 02:29:11,200
His... His... His... His older assistants!

3901
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:13,120
I... Sorry.

3902
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:13,740
I caught myself.

3903
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:14,740
I was, like, oh, my God.

3904
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:16,440
That sounded so wrong.

3905
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:18,420
That sounded so bad.

3906
02:29:20,020 --> 02:29:20,700
Chill.

3907
02:29:21,140 --> 02:29:21,620
Sorry.

3908
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:22,240
Sorry.

3909
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:24,880
From his... From his assistants.

3910
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:27,460
From his men... Assistant men!

3911
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:29,940
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

3912
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:30,280
Oh, there.

3913
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:31,720
I stopped myself.

3914
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,980
I stopped myself before I said something bad.

3915
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:35,620
I...

3916
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:37,160
Accidentally.

3917
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:40,460
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

3918
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:46,920
It was... Big strong men of self... Male assistants!

3919
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:48,360
That's right.

3920
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:50,460
That hand was sculpted!

3921
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:54,760
From one of those big strong ass assistants!

3922
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:04,020
I succeeded in my QuickTime event.

3923
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:05,920
Don't worry, guys.

3924
02:30:06,700 --> 02:30:10,840
I made sure to not fail my QuickTime event.

3925
02:30:13,320 --> 02:30:18,280
I mean, wasn't that why he liked sculpting, like, naked men all the times?

3926
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:20,560
Was that Michelangelo?

3927
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:21,240
I don't remember.

3928
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:23,020
No, no, that was Michelangelo.

3929
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:26,540
Michelangelo's the one that did the David and Goliath statue, right?

3930
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:27,640
Right?

3931
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:33,440
I wonder if someone's like, are you guys talking about teenage mutant?

3932
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:36,680
This is not the teenage mutant ninja turtles I grew up with.

3933
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:41,740
The turtle?

3934
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:44,220
It's Aritoki.

3935
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:50,760
It was Aritoki.

3936
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:53,120
You don't understand, Aritoki.

3937
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:00,560
Cowabunga, dude.

3938
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:11,560
Remember when PSA gave Tyler the Great Warrior a one-of-only kind make-a-wish card a 7 out of 10?

3939
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:13,520
Did they actually do that?

3940
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:15,700
Bro, Dan, I don't like PSA.

3941
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:17,840
Kong, thank you for the super chat.

3942
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:18,200
Thank you.

3943
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:18,840
Thank you.

3944
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:21,380
Is she done?

3945
02:31:21,700 --> 02:31:23,220
It's only an hour left.

3946
02:31:28,030 --> 02:31:31,210
That's actually fucked up, though, that PSA did that.

3947
02:31:31,770 --> 02:31:33,670
It sounds like PSA.

3948
02:31:36,090 --> 02:31:37,730
Yeah, I don't like...

3949
02:31:37,730 --> 02:31:40,450
I like the stories I hear from PSA.

3950
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:42,410
And how, like...

3951
02:31:42,410 --> 02:31:43,010
I don't know.

3952
02:31:43,010 --> 02:31:46,090
Like, I feel like, you know, it makes sense for them.

3953
02:31:46,350 --> 02:31:46,890
What's PSA?

3954
02:31:46,970 --> 02:31:53,310
For those who don't know what the PSA is, they're like the card grading company that everybody uses.

3955
02:31:53,310 --> 02:31:57,350
So, like, if you get a PSA 10 or something, then you can sell it for a lot of fucking money.

3956
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:11,310
But they're, like, the go-to card grading company if you're a scalper or, like, you know, a card collector.

3957
02:32:11,310 --> 02:32:16,350
And you want to be like, oh, my card is, like, the best card in the world because it's a PSA 10.

3958
02:32:16,350 --> 02:32:19,570
And they grade the conditions of the cards and stuff like that.

3959
02:32:19,730 --> 02:32:20,610
But they're so...

3960
02:32:20,610 --> 02:32:21,250
They're so...

3961
02:32:21,250 --> 02:32:27,310
People think it's, like, super random because they don't tell you why they grade the card the way the grade is.

3962
02:32:27,450 --> 02:32:31,150
But there's other grading companies that actually use, like...

3963
02:32:31,150 --> 02:32:32,430
That are much better.

3964
02:32:32,670 --> 02:32:34,010
That even tells you...

3965
02:32:34,010 --> 02:32:38,150
Like, they'll give you, like, play-by-play on why a card would get a grade.

3966
02:32:40,430 --> 02:32:42,010
Mostly scalpers use it.

3967
02:32:42,750 --> 02:32:44,090
And I'm one of them!

3968
02:32:45,010 --> 02:32:45,710
That's right.

3969
02:32:45,710 --> 02:32:47,090
I've got, uh...

3970
02:32:47,090 --> 02:32:50,190
I've got my Pokemon Charizard card.

3971
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:52,230
PSA 10 from one of them.

3972
02:32:56,530 --> 02:32:57,470
That's right.

3973
02:32:58,950 --> 02:33:02,370
Apparently, Magic the Gathering cards are also getting, like, fucked up, too.

3974
02:33:03,070 --> 02:33:03,670
But...

3975
02:33:03,670 --> 02:33:05,470
Which is surprising to me.

3976
02:33:05,690 --> 02:33:08,870
Because everyone always complains about the Pokemon scalpers.

3977
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:13,190
But Magic the Gathering cards are, like, um...

3978
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:15,170
Are also, like, um...

3979
02:33:15,170 --> 02:33:16,230
Getting fucked over now.

3980
02:33:18,310 --> 02:33:20,750
I also recently found out that Yu-Gi-Oh!

3981
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:23,230
was supposed to be a parody of Magic the Gathering.

3982
02:33:23,690 --> 02:33:24,390
And that...

3983
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:25,670
And, uh...

3984
02:33:25,670 --> 02:33:27,830
And I recently found that, uh...

3985
02:33:27,830 --> 02:33:28,210
Found...

3986
02:33:28,210 --> 02:33:29,830
I recently, like, found out about it.

3987
02:33:30,310 --> 02:33:31,430
And, uh...

3988
02:33:33,790 --> 02:33:36,950
And, like, Magic the Gathering tried to, like...

3989
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:37,690
Make a...

3990
02:33:38,330 --> 02:33:38,910
What is it called?

3991
02:33:38,990 --> 02:33:39,790
Is it Duel Masters?

3992
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:43,270
And Duel Masters is actually owned by Magic the Gathering.

3993
02:33:43,410 --> 02:33:44,710
I did not know that.

3994
02:33:46,050 --> 02:33:46,570
Yeah.

3995
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:49,450
Duel Masters is owned by Magic the Gathering.

3996
02:33:49,590 --> 02:33:50,350
And Yu-Gi-Oh!

3997
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:50,830
was supposed...

3998
02:33:50,830 --> 02:33:52,530
Supposed to be a parody.

3999
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:54,950
Uh...

4000
02:33:54,950 --> 02:33:56,470
Of Magic the Gathering cards.

4001
02:33:57,410 --> 02:33:59,750
I thought Duel Masters was, like, its own thing.

4002
02:34:01,130 --> 02:34:02,770
Oh, how much money did I make?

4003
02:34:03,650 --> 02:34:05,150
You just graded it.

4004
02:34:07,190 --> 02:34:08,390
Oh my god!

4005
02:34:08,390 --> 02:34:11,450
A hundred and sixty dollar Roonies?

4006
02:34:11,910 --> 02:34:13,670
Oh my god!

4007
02:34:13,970 --> 02:34:14,730
I'm rich!

4008
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:19,130
Eighty dollars?

4009
02:34:19,650 --> 02:34:23,250
This statue was carved by Banksy.

4010
02:34:27,010 --> 02:34:28,850
We're rich, ma!

4011
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:30,770
We're rich!

4012
02:34:33,070 --> 02:34:34,950
Alright, how do I go back?

4013
02:34:35,870 --> 02:34:36,990
I got a...

4014
02:34:36,990 --> 02:34:38,310
A Banksy original!

4015
02:34:39,670 --> 02:34:41,190
Oh, where am I driving to?

4016
02:34:44,970 --> 02:34:46,630
Oh no, I'm stuck.

4017
02:34:46,890 --> 02:34:47,510
Okay, it's fine.

4018
02:34:48,510 --> 02:34:49,930
Wait, this is not the way I have to go.

4019
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:51,750
How do I go home to Portsville?

4020
02:34:52,970 --> 02:34:53,350
Alright.

4021
02:34:56,370 --> 02:34:57,270
Here we go.

4022
02:34:59,650 --> 02:35:01,890
We eating good tonight, boys!

4023
02:35:03,630 --> 02:35:04,930
Duel Monsters was...

4024
02:35:04,930 --> 02:35:07,630
A dream called Magic and Wizards in Volume 2.

4025
02:35:07,850 --> 02:35:08,930
Yeah, because, like...

4026
02:35:08,930 --> 02:35:09,550
Rather than...

4027
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:10,990
Yeah, because it's apparently, like...

4028
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:11,350
Yu-Gi-Oh!

4029
02:35:11,370 --> 02:35:13,050
was not a card game at first.

4030
02:35:13,210 --> 02:35:14,590
It was, like, a...

4031
02:35:14,590 --> 02:35:15,950
It was a...

4032
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:17,030
Just, like...

4033
02:35:17,030 --> 02:35:17,510
Oh yeah!

4034
02:35:17,790 --> 02:35:18,170
Yu-Gi-Oh!

4035
02:35:18,190 --> 02:35:18,610
was...

4036
02:35:19,450 --> 02:35:19,930
Psychopathic.

4037
02:35:20,030 --> 02:35:21,610
Or sociopathic at first.

4038
02:35:21,950 --> 02:35:22,790
Not the...

4039
02:35:22,790 --> 02:35:23,650
Not the...

4040
02:35:23,650 --> 02:35:25,010
The child, but the...

4041
02:35:25,010 --> 02:35:26,130
The Egyptian guy.

4042
02:35:27,650 --> 02:35:28,430
He was...

4043
02:35:28,430 --> 02:35:29,890
He was, like, an actual, like...

4044
02:35:29,890 --> 02:35:30,750
Psychopath.

4045
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:32,270
In the original manga.

4046
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:34,010
Yeah.

4047
02:35:34,310 --> 02:35:34,530
Yeah.

4048
02:35:34,670 --> 02:35:36,490
Yami Yu-Gi was actually very evil.

4049
02:35:36,630 --> 02:35:37,050
I remember.

4050
02:35:37,210 --> 02:35:37,650
Because, like...

4051
02:35:37,650 --> 02:35:39,130
He was gonna burn someone alive.

4052
02:35:41,950 --> 02:35:42,910
He was...

4053
02:35:42,910 --> 02:35:43,450
He...

4054
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:44,650
In the original...

4055
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:46,430
In the original manga...

4056
02:35:46,430 --> 02:35:47,370
Uh...

4057
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:47,810
He...

4058
02:35:47,810 --> 02:35:48,170
There was...

4059
02:35:48,170 --> 02:35:49,370
There's a scene...

4060
02:35:49,370 --> 02:35:50,510
A famous scene...

4061
02:35:50,510 --> 02:35:52,710
Where he was actually gonna burn someone alive.

4062
02:35:52,950 --> 02:35:54,230
For, like, losing a game.

4063
02:35:54,410 --> 02:35:55,810
And he's like, It's just a game.

4064
02:35:55,950 --> 02:35:56,410
And then...

4065
02:35:58,190 --> 02:35:59,210
Oh, he did?

4066
02:35:59,530 --> 02:36:00,210
Oh, okay.

4067
02:36:00,350 --> 02:36:00,590
He did.

4068
02:36:00,730 --> 02:36:01,850
He actually did it.

4069
02:36:02,030 --> 02:36:04,570
He's like, It's a real shadow game.

4070
02:36:05,130 --> 02:36:05,510
Yeah.

4071
02:36:05,650 --> 02:36:07,310
And he put Kaiba in a coma, too.

4072
02:36:07,830 --> 02:36:07,970
Yeah.

4073
02:36:08,690 --> 02:36:10,110
And they're like, Wait a minute.

4074
02:36:10,510 --> 02:36:11,890
This card thing...

4075
02:36:11,890 --> 02:36:13,730
Is actually making us a lot of money.

4076
02:36:14,070 --> 02:36:14,370
Yeah.

4077
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:14,810
Children.

4078
02:36:15,130 --> 02:36:16,410
Maybe we should make the...

4079
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:17,690
Make it more kid-friendly.

4080
02:36:21,770 --> 02:36:23,410
And then they realize that...

4081
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:26,490
When they geared towards kid- A kid-friendlier version...

4082
02:36:26,490 --> 02:36:27,130
Um...

4083
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:28,730
They started making even more money.

4084
02:36:31,470 --> 02:36:33,450
Gotta love season zero.

4085
02:36:36,210 --> 02:36:38,930
Maybe a little less murder.

4086
02:36:39,450 --> 02:36:40,210
You know what?

4087
02:36:40,430 --> 02:36:42,510
I'm happy with our progress, dude.

4088
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:43,450
Let's sell our...

4089
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:45,270
Million dollar art collection.

4090
02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:46,930
And then...

4091
02:36:46,930 --> 02:36:47,930
Call it a day.

4092
02:36:49,310 --> 02:36:50,750
Bring back...

4093
02:36:50,750 --> 02:36:51,310
Evil...

4094
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:52,490
Evil Yugi.

4095
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:53,490
Evil...

4096
02:36:54,290 --> 02:36:55,430
He was like...

4097
02:36:55,430 --> 02:36:56,010
The Joker.

4098
02:36:56,370 --> 02:36:56,990
He was like...

4099
02:36:56,990 --> 02:36:57,690
Egyptian Joker.

4100
02:37:01,850 --> 02:37:02,410
Alright.

4101
02:37:03,770 --> 02:37:05,870
Wasn't there a spin-off of that...

4102
02:37:05,870 --> 02:37:06,790
Of that...

4103
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:07,770
Stupid...

4104
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:08,770
Dice...

4105
02:37:08,770 --> 02:37:10,750
Dice game that they did?

4106
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:13,230
It's not stupid!

4107
02:37:13,470 --> 02:37:15,270
You just didn't understand the game, Doki.

4108
02:37:15,890 --> 02:37:16,370
Doki.

4109
02:37:18,870 --> 02:37:19,430
Yeah.

4110
02:37:19,550 --> 02:37:20,930
Dungeon Dice Monster.

4111
02:37:21,010 --> 02:37:21,130
Yeah.

4112
02:37:21,230 --> 02:37:22,870
They tried to make Dungeon Dice a monster.

4113
02:37:23,130 --> 02:37:23,410
Yeah.

4114
02:37:23,630 --> 02:37:24,830
And then it died.

4115
02:37:25,650 --> 02:37:29,970
They're trying to make it a spin-off of Dungeon Dice Monster.

4116
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:34,750
Where's the gas station?

4117
02:37:35,050 --> 02:37:36,930
My car is not doing so well.

4118
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:38,270
It's here.

4119
02:37:40,230 --> 02:37:40,950
Slander.

4120
02:37:44,010 --> 02:37:46,590
There was a real strategy.

4121
02:37:47,770 --> 02:37:50,790
It was dope as fuck, Doki.

4122
02:37:51,310 --> 02:37:53,110
You're just a hater.

4123
02:37:57,420 --> 02:37:59,420
Just a guy, thank you for the super chat.

4124
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:00,360
Thank you, thank you.

4125
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:09,360
Kaiba also hired an axe-wielding serial killer to try and murder Joey on live television towards the end of season zero.

4126
02:38:09,780 --> 02:38:12,200
What the fuck was going on?

4127
02:38:16,680 --> 02:38:17,200
Alright.

4128
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:19,940
I think...

4129
02:38:20,580 --> 02:38:21,860
This is a good time to call it.

4130
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:23,520
I think I did okay today.

4131
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:24,740
You know what?

4132
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:26,120
That was a fun game, guys.

4133
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:27,360
I think this is a good time.

4134
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:28,600
I didn't even have to pay rent.

4135
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:30,600
I never made it past the first week.

4136
02:38:30,860 --> 02:38:34,160
But there is surprisingly a lot of content in this game.

4137
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:36,480
In this simulator.

4138
02:38:36,480 --> 02:38:37,980
I was not expecting it.

4139
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:43,320
I reached my goal.

4140
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:45,200
2010, thank you for the super chat.

4141
02:38:45,280 --> 02:38:45,900
Thank you, thank you.

4142
02:38:46,300 --> 02:38:50,280
Ironically, someone did get roasted alive for losing game two in season one.

4143
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:54,300
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

4144
02:38:54,400 --> 02:38:55,300
Thank you, thank you.

4145
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:56,100
Well, not exactly.

4146
02:38:56,400 --> 02:38:57,280
Oh, I already read that.

4147
02:38:57,420 --> 02:38:58,220
But thank you for the super chat.

4148
02:38:58,300 --> 02:38:58,820
Thank you, thank you.

4149
02:38:58,900 --> 02:38:59,180
Ultra!

4150
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:00,340
Thank you for the super chat.

4151
02:39:00,460 --> 02:39:01,200
Thank you, thank you.

4152
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:05,080
I was bored so I decided to buy your hot case and make something with it.

4153
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:06,840
I look forward to seeing end results.

4154
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,380
Thank you for the super chat, Ultra!

4155
02:39:08,660 --> 02:39:09,760
Thank you, thank you!

4156
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:11,000
Oh my god, I can't wait.

4157
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,120
I hope you post bonus of the results, guys.

4158
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:16,440
But yeah, you can still get my PC case at the Hyatt store.

4159
02:39:16,940 --> 02:39:18,960
I'm gonna call it here for the game.

4160
02:39:19,140 --> 02:39:21,080
Let's swap it off real quick.

4161
02:39:21,320 --> 02:39:22,200
That was fun, though.

4162
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:24,140
I had a lot of fun with that one.

4163
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:26,940
I just wanted, like, a one...

4164
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:27,900
You know, like...

4165
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:31,540
Sometimes it's, like, really difficult to find one-off games these days.

4166
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:33,840
So it was cool that I found them.

4167
02:39:34,060 --> 02:39:37,460
It was, like, on the new one trending.

4168
02:39:37,460 --> 02:39:39,240
So I was like, let's try this out.

4169
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:44,040
But it was really fun.

4170
02:39:44,380 --> 02:39:46,640
We had some crazy topics, too, today.

4171
02:39:47,660 --> 02:39:51,340
We had some crazy fun facts today.

4172
02:39:54,100 --> 02:39:57,280
But we do have another stream later tonight at 9pm.

4173
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:59,800
Where we're just gonna help me plan my vacation.

4174
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:03,800
I don't know when I'll be taking my vacation.

4175
02:40:04,620 --> 02:40:07,320
But I just felt like it'd be cool to just, like, plan it out.

4176
02:40:07,420 --> 02:40:09,820
So I won't be confused on what to do when I'm there.

4177
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:11,880
Uh...

4178
02:40:11,880 --> 02:40:12,800
Uh...

4179
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:15,460
Yeah, let me look through my super chats.

4180
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:16,400
Yeah!

4181
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:18,320
Oh, I never saved game, guys.

4182
02:40:18,540 --> 02:40:18,780
I...

4183
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:20,600
I just realized, like...

4184
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:23,060
They don't have autosave in this game.

4185
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:23,760
Hahaha!

4186
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:25,460
So I went save game.

4187
02:40:25,460 --> 02:40:29,100
It was literally empty slot, empty slot, empty slot.

4188
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:29,820
Hahaha!

4189
02:40:31,580 --> 02:40:32,440
But I saved it.

4190
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:33,320
Don't worry.

4191
02:40:33,740 --> 02:40:35,220
I saved it, guys.

4192
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:36,860
I was there.

4193
02:40:38,300 --> 02:40:38,900
Uh...

4194
02:40:39,700 --> 02:40:40,540
But yeah!

4195
02:40:40,820 --> 02:40:41,220
It was...

4196
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:42,880
It was just fun to...

4197
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:44,460
Um...

4198
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:45,700
Just, like...

4199
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:47,240
Just play a casual game.

4200
02:40:47,580 --> 02:40:48,700
And, uh...

4201
02:40:48,700 --> 02:40:50,600
Hang out with all of you guys today.

4202
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:51,520
Uh...

4203
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:52,500
It was a nice one-off.

4204
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:52,980
Yeah.

4205
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:54,240
Um...

4206
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:56,400
Cause it's so hard to find one-off games these days.

4207
02:40:56,620 --> 02:40:57,920
Especially for this time slot.

4208
02:40:58,160 --> 02:40:58,500
Uh...

4209
02:40:58,500 --> 02:40:59,280
Cause I know, like...

4210
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:01,480
This is a more EU-friendly time slot.

4211
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:03,580
Um...

4212
02:41:03,580 --> 02:41:04,280
So, like...

4213
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:06,420
I'm trying to find games that are, like, more...

4214
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:07,120
You know, they're not...

4215
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:09,180
Not too boring to play on stream.

4216
02:41:09,560 --> 02:41:10,620
And also, like...

4217
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:14,460
Usually I try to avoid starting a new series at this time slot.

4218
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:15,720
Cause I like putting...

4219
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:18,120
I like starting a new series at 5.

4220
02:41:18,260 --> 02:41:19,280
My usual...

4221
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:20,420
My NA time slot.

4222
02:41:20,660 --> 02:41:21,960
And then, like, if it's a long...

4223
02:41:21,960 --> 02:41:25,000
If I want to do a long session, then I'll, like, start at 1230.

4224
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:26,660
Um...

4225
02:41:26,660 --> 02:41:27,460
Yeah, so...

4226
02:41:27,460 --> 02:41:28,940
It's one of the more, you know...

4227
02:41:28,940 --> 02:41:29,980
More EU-friendly ones.

4228
02:41:29,980 --> 02:41:31,220
So, sometimes it's my...

4229
02:41:31,220 --> 02:41:31,840
Hard to find...

4230
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:33,960
Hard to find games for this time slot.

4231
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:34,800
But I'm glad I did.

4232
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:35,940
Um...

4233
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:37,640
I'm glad we tried the Storage Hunter game.

4234
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:38,660
Cause that was really fun.

4235
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:40,080
Um...

4236
02:41:41,740 --> 02:41:42,180
Yeah.

4237
02:41:43,580 --> 02:41:44,020
Uh...

4238
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:44,820
Yeah, cause that...

4239
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:46,580
You know, sometimes I don't want to play a series.

4240
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:47,460
And I just want to chill.

4241
02:41:51,320 --> 02:41:51,760
Uh...

4242
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:53,820
Alright, let's go...

4243
02:41:54,480 --> 02:41:54,920
To...

4244
02:41:58,880 --> 02:41:59,320
Superchats!

4245
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:01,280
Today's a wild day.

4246
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:02,520
I was a little entrenched today.

4247
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:03,200
Haha!

4248
02:42:05,860 --> 02:42:06,360
Uh...

4249
02:42:06,360 --> 02:42:07,520
Seijian, thank you for the superchat.

4250
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:08,340
Thank you, thank you.

4251
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:08,480
Yo!

4252
02:42:10,180 --> 02:42:10,680
Um...

4253
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:12,060
Angrius, thank you for the superchat.

4254
02:42:12,140 --> 02:42:12,640
Thank you, thank you.

4255
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:14,740
Have you set up the exercise bike machine?

4256
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,080
No, it's still...

4257
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:17,060
Um...

4258
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:18,320
It's still just, like...

4259
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:20,100
Up against the wall.

4260
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:21,240
Um...

4261
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:22,080
At my hallway.

4262
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:23,260
Uh...

4263
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:23,800
Hahaha!

4264
02:42:25,140 --> 02:42:25,640
Cause...

4265
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:26,240
Cause...

4266
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:27,300
Cause it's so...

4267
02:42:27,300 --> 02:42:27,800
Heavy!

4268
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:30,580
It's been...

4269
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:31,700
It's been...

4270
02:42:31,700 --> 02:42:32,000
It's been...

4271
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:32,120
It's been against...

4272
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:32,780
The wall.

4273
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:33,920
For like...

4274
02:42:33,920 --> 02:42:34,000
How...

4275
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:35,260
Yeah, it's been...

4276
02:42:35,260 --> 02:42:35,380
What?

4277
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:37,040
Hahaha!

4278
02:42:38,220 --> 02:42:39,520
Baby steps, guys!

4279
02:42:39,980 --> 02:42:41,060
Baby steps!

4280
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:42,960
I'll eat healthy...

4281
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:43,920
And then maybe...

4282
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:45,560
By then...

4283
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:47,060
I'll have enough energy...

4284
02:42:47,800 --> 02:42:48,260
To...

4285
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:49,500
Construct my bike...

4286
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:50,380
By then.

4287
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:52,020
Thank you for the superchat.

4288
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:53,160
Thank you, thank you.

4289
02:42:53,780 --> 02:42:53,960
Thank you.

4290
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:55,780
Um...

4291
02:42:55,780 --> 02:42:56,280
Um...

4292
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:56,980
Baconator.

4293
02:42:57,100 --> 02:42:57,860
Thank you for the superchat.

4294
02:42:57,960 --> 02:42:58,820
Thank you, thank you.

4295
02:43:01,300 --> 02:43:01,760
Uh...

4296
02:43:03,460 --> 02:43:03,920
Uh...

4297
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:09,840
Broken bun, thank you for the super chat.

4298
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,480
Thank you, thank you.

4299
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:11,940
Here for no reason, Tokyo.

4300
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:14,080
Tacos burrito, thank you for the super chat.

4301
02:43:14,180 --> 02:43:14,940
Thank you, thank you.

4302
02:43:14,940 --> 02:43:16,000
No rice cooker yet.

4303
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,480
I mean, now that you guys know my throne.

4304
02:43:21,020 --> 02:43:22,820
Actually, no, I shouldn't say that.

4305
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,780
I'm worried I get sent, like, four rice cookers.

4306
02:43:29,640 --> 02:43:31,200
That's what I'm worried about.

4307
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:33,060
Actually, do not do that.

4308
02:43:33,060 --> 02:43:36,560
I don't want to be sent four fucking rice cookers.

4309
02:43:40,660 --> 02:43:42,360
Put it up here.

4310
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:43,900
Too late.

4311
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:47,180
Like, what am I going to do?

4312
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:50,320
The doki box, I'll sign...

4313
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:53,820
If I get four rice cookers, I'll sign one of the...

4314
02:43:53,820 --> 02:43:57,500
I'll sign three of the rice cooker and then auction it off.

4315
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:59,520
I'll be my own storage.

4316
02:43:59,880 --> 02:44:01,880
I'll be my own auctioneer.

4317
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:04,680
That's a lot of rice.

4318
02:44:05,240 --> 02:44:07,020
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

4319
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:07,380
Thank you.

4320
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:08,260
Thank you.

4321
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:14,660
Please don't send me five rice cookers, guys.

4322
02:44:17,980 --> 02:44:18,440
Um...

4323
02:44:18,440 --> 02:44:19,140
Oh, George.

4324
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:20,240
Thank you for the super chat.

4325
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:21,240
Thank you, thank you.

4326
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:26,500
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

4327
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:26,900
Thank you.

4328
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:30,800
Simple-minded, thank you for the super chat.

4329
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:31,100
Thank you.

4330
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:31,560
Thank you.

4331
02:44:31,640 --> 02:44:32,720
I bet it was both.

4332
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:36,660
Only the dragon that bought it knows what color it is.

4333
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:39,920
Will you step up and reveal yourself?

4334
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:41,000
Question mark.

4335
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,640
Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

4336
02:44:46,740 --> 02:44:46,940
Thank you.

4337
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:47,540
Thank you.

4338
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:50,340
You're gonna get like 20 rice cookies.

4339
02:44:53,900 --> 02:44:56,160
Uh, uh... Kevin, thank you for the super chat.

4340
02:44:56,280 --> 02:44:57,320
Thank you, thank you.

4341
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:04,720
On the topic of the stream title, a main condition N64 would be so sad because it can't play Metal Gear Solid.

4342
02:45:04,880 --> 02:45:05,580
Thank you for the super chat.

4343
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:06,160
Thank you, thank you.

4344
02:45:06,180 --> 02:45:09,200
I never owned an N64, uh, to be fair.

4345
02:45:09,400 --> 02:45:12,940
But, because it was a Nintendo console, so I never owned one.

4346
02:45:13,140 --> 02:45:18,440
I think I owned like a bootleg console that was similar to an N64.

4347
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:18,660
N64.

4348
02:45:18,920 --> 02:45:22,580
I don't remember what... No, actually... No, I think I...

4349
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:23,840
No, it wasn't an N64.

4350
02:45:23,940 --> 02:45:25,360
It was purple... It was like...

4351
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:26,720
Gray slash purple.

4352
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:28,120
What is that?

4353
02:45:28,460 --> 02:45:30,440
It was like... A gray...

4354
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:34,300
It was gray, and then in the middle, it's like...

4355
02:45:34,300 --> 02:45:37,600
There's like this purple design in the middle of it.

4356
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:40,120
Um... What was it called?

4357
02:45:40,220 --> 02:45:41,240
Is it a Famicom?

4358
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:46,520
Was... Or was it purple?

4359
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:47,660
I don't remember.

4360
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:49,860
No, I had a Famicom!

4361
02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:50,900
It wasn't purple.

4362
02:45:50,900 --> 02:45:52,180
It was...

4363
02:45:52,180 --> 02:45:54,540
Oh, I had a Famicom!

4364
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:56,940
Yeah, I remember this.

4365
02:45:57,360 --> 02:45:57,820
Yeah.

4366
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:00,600
I think my...

4367
02:46:01,480 --> 02:46:02,220
Dad...

4368
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:04,720
This was my dad's console?

4369
02:46:05,100 --> 02:46:06,000
I think?

4370
02:46:07,820 --> 02:46:08,940
What... Was...

4371
02:46:08,940 --> 02:46:10,500
Was it a Famicom?

4372
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:11,740
It had Bomberman.

4373
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:15,500
It had...

4374
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:17,420
The Bomberman games in it.

4375
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:19,460
Uh...

4376
02:46:19,460 --> 02:46:20,840
Anyway, I broke it.

4377
02:46:20,980 --> 02:46:21,700
I burned it.

4378
02:46:23,080 --> 02:46:24,260
Smoke came out of it.

4379
02:46:24,300 --> 02:46:25,100
I didn't burn it.

4380
02:46:25,460 --> 02:46:26,940
But like...

4381
02:46:26,940 --> 02:46:27,720
Um...

4382
02:46:27,720 --> 02:46:29,020
One day...

4383
02:46:29,020 --> 02:46:30,380
I was playing...

4384
02:46:30,380 --> 02:46:31,180
Bomberman...

4385
02:46:31,740 --> 02:46:33,000
On it...

4386
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,380
And the smoke came out of the plug.

4387
02:46:36,940 --> 02:46:39,200
I shouldn't laugh about it.

4388
02:46:39,640 --> 02:46:40,440
But...

4389
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:41,860
Um...

4390
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:42,900
And then...

4391
02:46:42,900 --> 02:46:44,620
And then smoke came out.

4392
02:46:44,940 --> 02:46:47,240
And I don't think that's supposed...

4393
02:46:47,240 --> 02:46:48,160
And then...

4394
02:46:50,220 --> 02:46:52,160
It was like...

4395
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:54,060
Dude, that's real...

4396
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:56,680
Damn, that's realism right there.

4397
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:58,120
Was that on the Fam...

4398
02:46:58,120 --> 02:46:58,800
Yeah, it was.

4399
02:46:58,940 --> 02:47:00,480
It was developed on the...

4400
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:02,380
Oh, it's the Super Famicom!

4401
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:03,820
That's the purple one!

4402
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:04,200
Yeah!

4403
02:47:04,980 --> 02:47:05,900
I had...

4404
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:07,700
I had this one!

4405
02:47:08,760 --> 02:47:09,900
I had...

4406
02:47:09,900 --> 02:47:12,000
I had this one!

4407
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:15,040
That's the one that my dad...

4408
02:47:16,120 --> 02:47:16,720
Um...

4409
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:19,220
My dad got me.

4410
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:20,960
Or got himself.

4411
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:21,980
Because he played on it.

4412
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:24,020
This was the one.

4413
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:25,880
I remember.

4414
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:26,580
It had...

4415
02:47:26,580 --> 02:47:27,560
It had like...

4416
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:28,680
Purple on it.

4417
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:30,540
That's why I remember it.

4418
02:47:30,740 --> 02:47:31,720
Because it had purple.

4419
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:34,040
Uh...

4420
02:47:34,040 --> 02:47:36,000
Yeah, because we played...

4421
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,660
My dad and I would play...

4422
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:38,500
Uh...

4423
02:47:38,500 --> 02:47:40,400
Bomberman on this console.

4424
02:47:40,820 --> 02:47:42,160
Like the one with the...

4425
02:47:42,160 --> 02:47:43,380
Little kangaroos and stuff.

4426
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:45,360
Yeah.

4427
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:47,140
Oh, is that...

4428
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:47,580
When...

4429
02:47:47,580 --> 02:47:48,680
Okay, Super...

4430
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:50,380
Okay, what's the difference between...

4431
02:47:50,380 --> 02:47:51,100
Oh...

4432
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:52,500
What's the difference between the...

4433
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:54,660
Famicom and the original Famicom?

4434
02:47:55,140 --> 02:47:56,320
When did the original...

4435
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:57,200
1983?

4436
02:47:58,100 --> 02:47:59,500
Yeah, I didn't have...

4437
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:01,420
Uh...

4438
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:04,020
Yeah, I had this one.

4439
02:48:04,240 --> 02:48:05,340
And then like...

4440
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:07,420
One day I was playing Bomberman on it.

4441
02:48:07,980 --> 02:48:08,520
Um...

4442
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:11,180
And then smoke came out of the plug sockets.

4443
02:48:11,440 --> 02:48:12,420
And then like...

4444
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:13,240
I was freaking...

4445
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:14,420
And then I was like...

4446
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:16,440
Just sitting there looking at it.

4447
02:48:17,380 --> 02:48:17,860
And...

4448
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:19,000
Um...

4449
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:19,860
And...

4450
02:48:19,860 --> 02:48:20,700
No, it was so...

4451
02:48:20,700 --> 02:48:21,920
I don't remember which Bomber...

4452
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:22,760
I love Bomberman.

4453
02:48:22,900 --> 02:48:23,260
Because my...

4454
02:48:23,260 --> 02:48:24,740
Bomberman was like...

4455
02:48:24,740 --> 02:48:25,940
One of my childhood games.

4456
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:27,520
And my dad and I would play...

4457
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:30,420
I would beg my dad to play Bomberman with me all the time.

4458
02:48:30,680 --> 02:48:32,240
Because I love Bomberman.

4459
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:33,380
And...

4460
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:33,880
Um...

4461
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:34,680
I love...

4462
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:37,800
I think it was Bomberman 3 and 4 that I played.

4463
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:39,120
Yeah, 3 and 4.

4464
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:40,760
I think 4 was on...

4465
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:41,660
The...

4466
02:48:42,140 --> 02:48:43,120
Amicom too, right?

4467
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:46,520
And I would play like 3 and 4 with my dad all the time.

4468
02:48:47,220 --> 02:48:47,500
And...

4469
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:48,960
Um...

4470
02:48:48,960 --> 02:48:50,400
And it was like...

4471
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:50,840
One of my...

4472
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:51,840
And then like one...

4473
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:52,200
And then...

4474
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:55,000
But I'm pretty sure they were the bootleg version games.

4475
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,960
Because I'm pretty sure my dad bought those like...

4476
02:48:57,960 --> 02:49:00,160
100 games in one...

4477
02:49:04,210 --> 02:49:05,230
I'm pretty sure.

4478
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:06,950
I'm pretty sure.

4479
02:49:07,250 --> 02:49:09,450
That's what my dad bought.

4480
02:49:09,830 --> 02:49:11,070
It was the...

4481
02:49:11,070 --> 02:49:14,010
The 100 games in one thing.

4482
02:49:14,670 --> 02:49:15,270
I'm...

4483
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:31,590
Yeah, it's like, now that I'm thinking, yeah, now that I'm thinking about it, um, like, we just selected the game from, like, a list.

4484
02:49:31,730 --> 02:49:39,330
Like, we didn't, like, swap, we didn't, like, swap, like, uh, the, the cartridges or anything.

4485
02:49:45,310 --> 02:49:46,650
Oh, it's an economy.

4486
02:49:47,090 --> 02:49:50,870
Oh, it's an economy port, not a mood.

4487
02:49:51,010 --> 02:49:52,250
Like, I don't know.

4488
02:49:52,450 --> 02:49:53,270
I don't know.

4489
02:49:53,410 --> 02:49:59,830
Because I just, I just remembered, like, it was not, like, we didn't, like, swap the game.

4490
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:02,630
And we literally, like, selected it.

4491
02:50:02,750 --> 02:50:05,750
Like, because I don't remember, like, ever swapping games.

4492
02:50:08,410 --> 02:50:12,210
Yeah, we, I, it was just, um, but one day.

4493
02:50:12,930 --> 02:50:15,030
Oh, he caught, right, right, he caught him.

4494
02:50:15,170 --> 02:50:16,070
Nothing legal here.

4495
02:50:19,530 --> 02:50:24,170
Because I, I, I actually don't remember if we ever swapped it.

4496
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:28,450
Um, what was that Bomberman game where we headed to the carnival?

4497
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:29,710
That one was fun.

4498
02:50:30,130 --> 02:50:32,890
Was that also on the carnival game?

4499
02:50:36,990 --> 02:50:37,590
Bomberman.

4500
02:50:37,590 --> 02:50:38,190
Bomberman.

4501
02:50:38,590 --> 02:50:39,190
Bomberman.

4502
02:50:39,810 --> 02:50:40,410
Carnival.

4503
02:50:42,670 --> 02:50:45,790
Was that, what, what game was that?

4504
02:50:46,470 --> 02:50:48,690
Or was it, like, at the amusement park?

4505
02:50:48,810 --> 02:50:51,990
Do you guys remember that Bomberman game where you're at an amusement park?

4506
02:50:53,250 --> 02:50:54,190
Bomberman land!

4507
02:50:54,610 --> 02:50:56,250
Oh, that one was fun.

4508
02:50:56,870 --> 02:50:59,150
It was all in Japanese, but that...

4509
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:04,130
Bomberman land!

4510
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:07,190
Was all in Japanese.

4511
02:51:07,190 --> 02:51:09,910
I had no idea how to play this game.

4512
02:51:10,130 --> 02:51:11,570
But that game was fun.

4513
02:51:12,750 --> 02:51:15,650
I don't know how to play it.

4514
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:20,510
Because, because, like, um, I was so confused.

4515
02:51:20,770 --> 02:51:23,410
But it seemed like a fun game.

4516
02:51:24,290 --> 02:51:26,050
Because I played it a lot.

4517
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:28,250
I don't know what I was doing.

4518
02:51:28,570 --> 02:51:29,670
But it was fun.

4519
02:51:31,770 --> 02:51:32,330
Yeah.

4520
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:36,110
I don't even know if it ever got ported into English, guys.

4521
02:51:36,750 --> 02:51:37,230
I...

4522
02:51:37,230 --> 02:51:39,710
I don't think it was...

4523
02:51:39,710 --> 02:51:41,290
Was it ever released in English?

4524
02:51:41,730 --> 02:51:42,510
Let's see.

4525
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:43,590
Release.

4526
02:51:43,590 --> 02:51:44,710
No, okay.

4527
02:51:44,850 --> 02:51:45,190
Yeah, no.

4528
02:51:45,310 --> 02:51:46,490
I definitely just played.

4529
02:51:46,790 --> 02:51:49,290
I've only just played the English version.

4530
02:51:49,470 --> 02:51:50,610
There's only a...

4531
02:51:50,610 --> 02:51:51,230
I'm looking.

4532
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:51,530
Yeah.

4533
02:51:51,730 --> 02:51:52,270
Japan.

4534
02:51:52,570 --> 02:51:53,730
December 21.

4535
02:51:54,270 --> 02:51:55,010
Dude, that...

4536
02:51:55,010 --> 02:51:56,690
My dad used to do that a lot.

4537
02:51:56,970 --> 02:51:57,970
He would, like...

4538
02:51:57,970 --> 02:52:00,030
He would buy me...

4539
02:52:01,270 --> 02:52:01,830
Like...

4540
02:52:01,830 --> 02:52:03,150
Children games.

4541
02:52:03,850 --> 02:52:05,590
But they were all in Japanese.

4542
02:52:05,590 --> 02:52:06,290
Japanese.

4543
02:52:06,830 --> 02:52:07,950
So, like...

4544
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:12,930
I didn't know how to play.

4545
02:52:14,010 --> 02:52:14,670
Like...

4546
02:52:14,670 --> 02:52:15,370
Oh, my...

4547
02:52:15,370 --> 02:52:16,230
I think, like...

4548
02:52:16,230 --> 02:52:16,450
Okay.

4549
02:52:16,850 --> 02:52:17,090
This...

4550
02:52:17,090 --> 02:52:18,050
This is an Asian...

4551
02:52:18,050 --> 02:52:19,530
This is definitely, like...

4552
02:52:19,530 --> 02:52:20,970
If you're...

4553
02:52:22,450 --> 02:52:23,110
Um...

4554
02:52:23,110 --> 02:52:24,630
If you're, like...

4555
02:52:24,630 --> 02:52:25,730
Chinese...

4556
02:52:25,730 --> 02:52:27,190
You might know, like...

4557
02:52:27,190 --> 02:52:28,650
These types of stores...

4558
02:52:28,650 --> 02:52:29,530
Where, like...

4559
02:52:29,530 --> 02:52:30,750
They just sell discs.

4560
02:52:34,430 --> 02:52:35,450
You know?

4561
02:52:35,650 --> 02:52:36,310
Where...

4562
02:52:36,310 --> 02:52:37,430
They just sell...

4563
02:52:37,430 --> 02:52:38,510
The discs.

4564
02:52:42,150 --> 02:52:43,310
And, like...

4565
02:52:43,310 --> 02:52:45,110
I remember...

4566
02:52:45,110 --> 02:52:46,910
Growing up...

4567
02:52:46,910 --> 02:52:47,450
Um...

4568
02:52:47,450 --> 02:52:49,710
My dad would take me to these, like...

4569
02:52:49,710 --> 02:52:50,670
Obviously, like...

4570
02:52:50,670 --> 02:52:51,570
Gaming stores.

4571
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:53,070
Yeah, like...

4572
02:52:53,070 --> 02:52:55,270
Packaging is...

4573
02:52:55,270 --> 02:52:55,970
Pricy.

4574
02:52:56,150 --> 02:52:56,890
Or worldwide.

4575
02:52:57,250 --> 02:52:57,570
Like...

4576
02:52:57,570 --> 02:52:58,130
But, like...

4577
02:52:58,130 --> 02:52:59,090
It was, like...

4578
02:52:59,090 --> 02:53:00,210
It was, like...

4579
02:53:00,210 --> 02:53:01,270
These, like...

4580
02:53:01,270 --> 02:53:01,750
Like...

4581
02:53:01,750 --> 02:53:03,130
Stores that were, like...

4582
02:53:03,130 --> 02:53:03,930
Selling...

4583
02:53:05,170 --> 02:53:06,950
That were selling games and stuff.

4584
02:53:07,270 --> 02:53:08,630
But then you're, like...

4585
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:09,690
Okay, we want...

4586
02:53:09,690 --> 02:53:11,450
I don't remember what my dad would say.

4587
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:11,990
But, like...

4588
02:53:11,990 --> 02:53:12,330
We're, like...

4589
02:53:12,330 --> 02:53:13,250
Oh, we want these...

4590
02:53:13,250 --> 02:53:14,650
We want those ones.

4591
02:53:14,750 --> 02:53:15,110
And they're, like...

4592
02:53:15,110 --> 02:53:15,370
Oh...

4593
02:53:15,370 --> 02:53:16,190
And then they, like...

4594
02:53:16,190 --> 02:53:18,290
Bring out a giant box...

4595
02:53:18,290 --> 02:53:19,050
Of, like...

4596
02:53:19,050 --> 02:53:21,410
They'll bring out a giant box of, like...

4597
02:53:21,410 --> 02:53:22,730
Like, a cardboard box.

4598
02:53:22,770 --> 02:53:24,470
And it's just filled with, like...

4599
02:53:24,470 --> 02:53:26,030
Like, different games and stuff.

4600
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:27,050
Like, just a disc.

4601
02:53:27,330 --> 02:53:28,470
And, like, clear packaging.

4602
02:53:29,090 --> 02:53:29,490
And...

4603
02:53:31,170 --> 02:53:34,510
And you just flip through it, and shit like that.

4604
02:53:34,850 --> 02:53:37,030
Yeah, it's just the plastic sleeves.

4605
02:53:37,230 --> 02:53:43,590
Yeah, Burning Disc was a... Yeah, and then like... And then, but they're like Japanese games, too.

4606
02:53:43,830 --> 02:53:48,370
And then... My dad would like, be like, oh, hey, look.

4607
02:53:48,710 --> 02:53:59,150
You should be able to buy them for me, because they're... And then, you know, because they'll be like, you have to ask for it.

4608
02:53:59,150 --> 02:54:03,850
And they'll just bring it out from under their desk, and it's like, literally... Wait, let me draw it out.

4609
02:54:03,930 --> 02:54:07,750
This is like a flashbulb memory that... Like, he would take me to these stores.

4610
02:54:08,110 --> 02:54:11,910
And like, literally, like, there's this cardboard box like this.

4611
02:54:12,170 --> 02:54:17,750
And then it's like... Filled with... And then you flip through him.

4612
02:54:18,150 --> 02:54:21,510
Wait, let me... Okay, you don't see it yet, but I'm drawing it right now.

4613
02:54:24,150 --> 02:54:26,310
I just have, like, a memory of that.

4614
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:29,190
But... Alright.

4615
02:54:30,930 --> 02:54:33,290
And then, it's like DVDs, too, you know?

4616
02:54:33,410 --> 02:54:36,130
Like, I know, like, people do it for DVDs and stuff as well.

4617
02:54:36,190 --> 02:54:37,970
But my dad did it for games.

4618
02:54:38,830 --> 02:54:40,750
We would buy legit games, though.

4619
02:54:40,970 --> 02:54:42,770
We would buy legit English games.

4620
02:54:42,850 --> 02:54:46,650
But this is like... I think it was like the only way for my dad to get Chinese games.

4621
02:54:46,870 --> 02:54:49,190
Like, games with, like, Chinese subtitles on.

4622
02:54:49,370 --> 02:54:51,270
Or he'll just buy the Japanese version.

4623
02:54:52,810 --> 02:54:54,730
I'll just buy the Japanese version.

4624
02:54:55,050 --> 02:54:56,290
Because, um...

4625
02:54:56,290 --> 02:54:58,970
The Japanese version has, like, kanji.

4626
02:54:59,170 --> 02:55:00,150
And he... You know, you like...

4627
02:55:00,150 --> 02:55:03,430
Kanji has, like, similar Chinese words on it.

4628
02:55:03,610 --> 02:55:07,650
So then, like, that was his way of, like, being able to read what's going on.

4629
02:55:16,030 --> 02:55:17,750
Yeah, so you can sort of read it.

4630
02:55:17,870 --> 02:55:18,950
So, like...

4631
02:55:20,070 --> 02:55:21,470
So it looked like this.

4632
02:55:22,350 --> 02:55:22,510
You know?

4633
02:55:22,850 --> 02:55:24,710
Like, there's the cardboard box.

4634
02:55:24,930 --> 02:55:27,910
And then, like, there would be, like, stacks of discs in there.

4635
02:55:28,010 --> 02:55:29,250
And you just flip through it.

4636
02:55:30,410 --> 02:55:30,850
Like...

4637
02:55:33,860 --> 02:55:34,300
Yeah.

4638
02:55:34,300 --> 02:55:36,720
You remember those times.

4639
02:55:36,860 --> 02:55:38,840
You remember those times.

4640
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:41,260
100% disc with a name.

4641
02:55:41,640 --> 02:55:43,520
No, but sometimes they would, like...

4642
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:44,900
They would, like...

4643
02:55:44,900 --> 02:55:47,560
Print the game on the disc, too.

4644
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:49,960
Or, like, they'll have, like...

4645
02:55:49,960 --> 02:55:50,740
They'll have the...

4646
02:55:50,740 --> 02:55:53,120
They'll print out a piece of paper with the packaging.

4647
02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:54,400
Like, what the game is.

4648
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:56,000
Oh, yeah.

4649
02:55:56,180 --> 02:55:57,600
Sweet memories.

4650
02:55:58,740 --> 02:55:59,300
Yeah.

4651
02:55:59,680 --> 02:56:00,220
They would not...

4652
02:56:00,220 --> 02:56:01,640
It won't just be, like, written...

4653
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:03,000
It won't just be a blank disc.

4654
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:04,660
They actually, like...

4655
02:56:04,660 --> 02:56:05,640
It was, like...

4656
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:07,020
High quality bootleg.

4657
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:08,800
Where, um...

4658
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:12,300
They actually have, like, the game art on the disc itself.

4659
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:13,740
Or, like...

4660
02:56:13,740 --> 02:56:15,740
They'll print out a piece of paper.

4661
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:16,720
Um...

4662
02:56:16,720 --> 02:56:17,200
And...

4663
02:56:17,200 --> 02:56:18,000
With the packaging.

4664
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,240
And be like, this is this game.

4665
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:26,440
Um...

4666
02:56:26,440 --> 02:56:26,720
All right.

4667
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:27,960
Thank you for the super chat.

4668
02:56:28,100 --> 02:56:28,360
Thank you.

4669
02:56:28,520 --> 02:56:29,040
Thank you.

4670
02:56:29,800 --> 02:56:30,240
Uh...

4671
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:31,900
My dad bought me a...

4672
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:36,800
PSP in China that came with a custom firmware installed and a stack of DVDs with ROMs.

4673
02:56:36,880 --> 02:56:37,260
Good times.

4674
02:56:37,380 --> 02:56:38,060
Thank you for the super chat.

4675
02:56:38,200 --> 02:56:39,060
Thank you, thank you.

4676
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:41,960
Uh, Solid Snake, thank you for the super chat.

4677
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:42,660
Thank you, thank you.

4678
02:56:42,740 --> 02:56:45,560
100% disc with a name written with marker on bags.

4679
02:56:45,740 --> 02:56:47,120
Thank you, Dad and Latin America.

4680
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:49,580
Those games and movies were so fun.

4681
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:51,800
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4682
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:54,260
My- Oh my gosh, that reminds me.

4683
02:56:54,600 --> 02:56:59,260
And then, like, um, back then, when I lived in Asia.

4684
02:57:00,980 --> 02:57:09,120
Back then, it was so hard because there wasn't any streaming services, actually.

4685
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:12,220
Back then, there wasn't streaming services.

4686
02:57:12,580 --> 02:57:15,620
And it's so hard to watch...

4687
02:57:17,460 --> 02:57:22,180
Sometimes it's really difficult to watch English movies, too.

4688
02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:25,100
So my dad, it was very similar.

4689
02:57:25,420 --> 02:57:28,480
My dad would take me to a place...

4690
02:57:30,180 --> 02:57:34,580
Where it's also termed like this, but for movies instead.

4691
02:57:38,240 --> 02:57:39,520
Like this.

4692
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:40,760
And like...

4693
02:57:40,760 --> 02:57:42,760
I remember it was when...

4694
02:57:45,320 --> 02:57:46,200
The...

4695
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:48,780
What was that movie?

4696
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:51,420
The Wolverine Origins movie?

4697
02:57:51,700 --> 02:57:53,040
The one where...

4698
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:56,060
Ryan Reynolds was in it as...

4699
02:57:56,060 --> 02:57:57,940
OG Deadpool?

4700
02:57:58,500 --> 02:58:00,340
The OG Deadpool.

4701
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:02,120
And...

4702
02:58:02,120 --> 02:58:03,320
But...

4703
02:58:04,060 --> 02:58:04,680
But...

4704
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:06,440
When we bought that movie...

4705
02:58:12,100 --> 02:58:14,360
It was the version...

4706
02:58:14,360 --> 02:58:15,900
That was...

4707
02:58:15,900 --> 02:58:17,820
Not finished...

4708
02:58:17,820 --> 02:58:18,860
CGI...

4709
02:58:18,860 --> 02:58:19,900
At the end.

4710
02:58:20,280 --> 02:58:21,600
So I was...

4711
02:58:21,600 --> 02:58:22,700
So...

4712
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:23,720
Confused.

4713
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:25,220
I was...

4714
02:58:26,050 --> 02:58:29,340
I remember trying to watch this with my dad.

4715
02:58:30,030 --> 02:58:32,360
And it was the not finished...

4716
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:34,120
CGI one.

4717
02:58:34,400 --> 02:58:36,600
But I was so young...

4718
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:38,410
That I was just like...

4719
02:58:38,410 --> 02:58:40,210
What's going on?

4720
02:58:40,330 --> 02:58:41,690
I was so confused.

4721
02:58:42,670 --> 02:58:44,810
Because it was literally...

4722
02:58:44,810 --> 02:58:45,410
Like...

4723
02:58:46,050 --> 02:58:46,810
The old...

4724
02:58:46,810 --> 02:58:47,670
The old...

4725
02:58:47,670 --> 02:58:48,050
The green...

4726
02:58:48,050 --> 02:58:48,930
Yeah, it was...

4727
02:58:48,930 --> 02:58:49,430
I got...

4728
02:58:49,430 --> 02:58:50,030
We got...

4729
02:58:50,030 --> 02:58:52,870
The actual green screen version...

4730
02:58:52,870 --> 02:58:53,810
Copy of that.

4731
02:58:54,390 --> 02:58:54,750
And...

4732
02:58:58,350 --> 02:58:59,350
I don't know.

4733
02:58:59,470 --> 02:59:02,330
I don't know how they got that version of the movie.

4734
02:59:02,570 --> 02:59:03,890
It was the...

4735
02:59:04,470 --> 02:59:04,970
Post...

4736
02:59:04,970 --> 02:59:05,690
It was not...

4737
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:07,790
Not finished CGI one.

4738
02:59:07,990 --> 02:59:08,900
That my dad...

4739
02:59:09,490 --> 02:59:10,530
And I bought.

4740
02:59:14,110 --> 02:59:16,110
I don't know if I still have it.

4741
02:59:16,290 --> 02:59:17,050
I don't know.

4742
02:59:17,170 --> 02:59:19,330
It might be in some fucking box somewhere.

4743
02:59:20,490 --> 02:59:21,030
Like...

4744
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:22,250
Yeah, I got the...

4745
02:59:22,250 --> 02:59:24,550
I got the raw edit of it.

4746
02:59:25,230 --> 02:59:25,770
Uh...

4747
02:59:25,770 --> 02:59:26,830
Amongst, thank you in the super chat.

4748
02:59:26,930 --> 02:59:27,170
Thank you.

4749
02:59:27,330 --> 02:59:27,870
Thank you.

4750
02:59:28,230 --> 02:59:30,340
You see, you guys laugh about the Minecraft...

4751
02:59:31,710 --> 02:59:32,250
Production...

4752
02:59:32,250 --> 02:59:34,550
Like pre-production Minecraft movie.

4753
02:59:34,690 --> 02:59:35,590
But back then...

4754
02:59:35,590 --> 02:59:36,610
I...

4755
02:59:36,610 --> 02:59:37,050
Had the...

4756
02:59:37,050 --> 02:59:37,990
I had the...

4757
02:59:37,990 --> 02:59:41,670
X-Men Origins Wolverine version.

4758
02:59:42,050 --> 02:59:44,050
Where Deadpool is like...

4759
02:59:44,050 --> 02:59:44,890
Fully CGI.

4760
02:59:45,490 --> 02:59:47,510
On top of a fucking...

4761
02:59:47,510 --> 02:59:47,890
Like...

4762
02:59:47,890 --> 02:59:49,270
It was so weird.

4763
02:59:49,670 --> 02:59:49,870
He...

4764
02:59:49,870 --> 02:59:50,010
I...

4765
02:59:50,010 --> 02:59:50,510
I like...

4766
02:59:50,510 --> 02:59:51,550
Remember it vaguely.

4767
02:59:51,770 --> 02:59:52,050
But...

4768
02:59:52,050 --> 02:59:54,390
It was a scene where he was just CGI.

4769
02:59:54,870 --> 02:59:56,110
On top of like...

4770
02:59:56,110 --> 02:59:57,290
Some fucking...

4771
02:59:57,890 --> 02:59:58,230
Like...

4772
02:59:58,770 --> 02:59:59,030
Like...

4773
02:59:59,030 --> 02:59:59,750
I guess like...

4774
02:59:59,750 --> 03:00:00,670
Disc or some shit.

4775
03:00:00,790 --> 03:00:01,290
And also...

4776
03:00:01,290 --> 03:00:02,610
Cause it was like...

4777
03:00:02,610 --> 03:00:03,210
It like...

4778
03:00:03,210 --> 03:00:04,370
It was at the end.

4779
03:00:04,490 --> 03:00:05,770
It was like...

4780
03:00:05,770 --> 03:00:07,590
Everything looked okay.

4781
03:00:07,950 --> 03:00:09,810
Until the last...

4782
03:00:09,810 --> 03:00:10,430
Like...

4783
03:00:10,430 --> 03:00:11,190
30 minutes.

4784
03:00:11,350 --> 03:00:12,790
Where it was just all CGI.

4785
03:00:13,490 --> 03:00:14,010
Like...

4786
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:19,600
It was...

4787
03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:20,640
It was unfinished CGI.

4788
03:00:25,380 --> 03:00:26,020
Like...

4789
03:00:26,020 --> 03:00:27,100
You don't know...

4790
03:00:27,100 --> 03:00:27,500
Like...

4791
03:00:27,500 --> 03:00:28,280
You don't know...

4792
03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:29,720
It was so normal.

4793
03:00:29,800 --> 03:00:30,660
It was so normal.

4794
03:00:30,680 --> 03:00:31,280
Until then.

4795
03:00:33,160 --> 03:00:33,640
Um...

4796
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:33,940
NSD.

4797
03:00:34,120 --> 03:00:34,880
Thank you for the super chat.

4798
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:35,240
Thank you.

4799
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:35,840
Thank you.

4800
03:00:36,100 --> 03:00:37,100
If you're gonna...

4801
03:00:37,100 --> 03:00:38,080
Bring up that Deadpool...

4802
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:38,780
I gotta ask...

4803
03:00:38,780 --> 03:00:39,580
Why the hell...

4804
03:00:39,580 --> 03:00:41,720
I gotta go out streaming services...

4805
03:00:41,720 --> 03:00:42,800
Doing in a school.

4806
03:00:43,060 --> 03:00:44,680
Thank you for the super chat.

4807
03:00:44,780 --> 03:00:45,120
Thank you.

4808
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:45,960
Thank you.

4809
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:49,400
Yeah.

4810
03:00:50,080 --> 03:00:50,560
No?

4811
03:00:51,220 --> 03:00:53,080
Oh, he wants food early.

4812
03:00:53,340 --> 03:00:54,040
It's not...

4813
03:00:54,040 --> 03:00:54,920
It's not...

4814
03:00:54,920 --> 03:00:55,120
Ready.

4815
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:56,120
Um...

4816
03:00:56,120 --> 03:00:58,300
I don't remember how my dad reacted to it.

4817
03:00:58,360 --> 03:01:00,600
I just remember being so fucking confused.

4818
03:01:02,340 --> 03:01:02,780
Um...

4819
03:01:04,020 --> 03:01:04,460
Um...

4820
03:01:04,460 --> 03:01:05,040
But yeah.

4821
03:01:05,180 --> 03:01:05,700
I think like...

4822
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:06,640
Back then too.

4823
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:08,520
I think it was cause like...

4824
03:01:09,120 --> 03:01:09,360
Uh...

4825
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:09,980
Back then.

4826
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:11,500
I don't know if people know about this.

4827
03:01:11,720 --> 03:01:12,060
Um...

4828
03:01:12,060 --> 03:01:12,420
But...

4829
03:01:12,420 --> 03:01:14,320
The only way you can buy...

4830
03:01:14,320 --> 03:01:15,400
Actual like...

4831
03:01:15,400 --> 03:01:16,260
Games too.

4832
03:01:16,520 --> 03:01:17,000
Back then.

4833
03:01:17,220 --> 03:01:18,560
When I used to live in Asia.

4834
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:19,360
Like when I used to...

4835
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:20,640
Also like when I used to live in China.

4836
03:01:20,780 --> 03:01:21,520
Was in...

4837
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:22,360
Hong Kong.

4838
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:23,260
Um...

4839
03:01:23,260 --> 03:01:23,700
Cause I...

4840
03:01:23,700 --> 03:01:24,260
You guys...

4841
03:01:24,260 --> 03:01:25,020
I told you guys before.

4842
03:01:25,100 --> 03:01:26,880
But I used to live in Shenzhen as well.

4843
03:01:27,560 --> 03:01:28,080
And...

4844
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:28,240
Uh...

4845
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:29,140
When I lived in Shenzhen.

4846
03:01:29,780 --> 03:01:30,840
Consoles back then.

4847
03:01:31,100 --> 03:01:33,100
I don't know if they changed the law.

4848
03:01:33,480 --> 03:01:34,140
Where like...

4849
03:01:34,140 --> 03:01:36,320
You can't get consoles back then.

4850
03:01:36,600 --> 03:01:37,880
Because of the laws.

4851
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:38,460
Uh...

4852
03:01:38,460 --> 03:01:39,040
Because...

4853
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:39,280
Um...

4854
03:01:39,280 --> 03:01:40,660
You can only buy like...

4855
03:01:40,660 --> 03:01:41,040
Uh...

4856
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:42,280
Consoles made in China.

4857
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:44,600
Cause they did have like their own type of consoles.

4858
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:45,520
But...

4859
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:46,500
You can't...

4860
03:01:47,360 --> 03:01:47,880
Um...

4861
03:01:47,880 --> 03:01:48,840
You can't...

4862
03:01:49,220 --> 03:01:49,480
Um...

4863
03:01:49,480 --> 03:01:50,340
Have like...

4864
03:01:50,340 --> 03:01:55,160
You can't buy, like, PlayStations or Xbox 360s and stuff like that.

4865
03:01:55,300 --> 03:01:59,680
So it was a lot harder to get games as well if you do own the consoles.

4866
03:02:00,420 --> 03:02:10,360
And so because of that, the only way to get, like, the actual games itself is if you go to Hong Kong to buy them.

4867
03:02:11,420 --> 03:02:13,800
Or you go to the underground market.

4868
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:20,880
Does anyone remember the underground gaming market?

4869
03:02:26,220 --> 03:02:29,300
Like, I remember when my dad would take me there.

4870
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:31,080
And they're like...

4871
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:34,400
Yeah, and it was just all, like, you know, PC stuff you can buy.

4872
03:02:34,740 --> 03:02:36,900
And everything, like, the legit games.

4873
03:02:36,900 --> 03:02:40,460
But then they have, like, you know, the special box.

4874
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:47,760
The special box.

4875
03:02:50,020 --> 03:02:51,120
Alright, let me pick him.

4876
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:52,480
Maybe if I pick him up.

4877
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:52,960
Oh.

4878
03:02:54,380 --> 03:02:54,740
Alright.

4879
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:11,460
He's on my lap.

4880
03:03:12,820 --> 03:03:14,440
He's barking too much.

4881
03:03:14,880 --> 03:03:16,120
He's barking too much!

4882
03:03:16,300 --> 03:03:17,660
So he's on my lap right now.

4883
03:03:20,460 --> 03:03:21,680
My head, what is that?

4884
03:03:22,640 --> 03:03:23,140
Yeah.

4885
03:03:23,500 --> 03:03:24,080
Forget him.

4886
03:03:24,280 --> 03:03:25,340
Since he's on my lap.

4887
03:03:25,800 --> 03:03:27,640
I'll let you guys see him.

4888
03:03:28,280 --> 03:03:28,860
There you go.

4889
03:03:29,140 --> 03:03:30,620
Class president is here now.

4890
03:03:34,300 --> 03:03:36,120
We have Mr. Class President.

4891
03:03:36,720 --> 03:03:37,760
He's a naughty boy.

4892
03:03:38,740 --> 03:03:39,660
But let me...

4893
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:39,940
Okay.

4894
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:41,340
Give me a sec.

4895
03:03:42,140 --> 03:03:43,500
Let me make it so you guys can action.

4896
03:03:43,660 --> 03:03:44,480
So he's not cut off.

4897
03:03:46,560 --> 03:03:47,080
Uh...

4898
03:03:47,080 --> 03:03:47,700
Alright.

4899
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:50,180
There you go.

4900
03:03:51,160 --> 03:03:53,420
It was a different time back then.

4901
03:03:55,360 --> 03:03:55,880
Um...

4902
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:56,660
No.

4903
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:57,520
No.

4904
03:03:57,640 --> 03:03:58,300
No barking.

4905
03:03:58,700 --> 03:04:00,660
No barking, Mr. Class President.

4906
03:04:01,640 --> 03:04:02,160
Uh...

4907
03:04:02,160 --> 03:04:02,500
Oh yeah!

4908
03:04:02,680 --> 03:04:03,200
I can have him on my...

4909
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:04,160
Oh my god, you're right!

4910
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:05,000
What's happening?

4911
03:04:05,180 --> 03:04:06,120
I forgot about that.

4912
03:04:06,940 --> 03:04:07,740
It's been so long.

4913
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:09,700
Where is it?

4914
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:11,280
Give me a sec.

4915
03:04:11,380 --> 03:04:12,100
Get out of here!

4916
03:04:12,100 --> 03:04:14,120
I'm gonna put down my phone.

4917
03:04:14,720 --> 03:04:15,680
There you go.

4918
03:04:16,080 --> 03:04:16,340
Yay!

4919
03:04:17,660 --> 03:04:18,640
There he is.

4920
03:04:18,920 --> 03:04:19,960
Mr. Class President.

4921
03:04:24,900 --> 03:04:25,440
Um...

4922
03:04:25,440 --> 03:04:25,940
But I don't know.

4923
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:26,800
Is it still the same?

4924
03:04:27,180 --> 03:04:28,520
It's easier now, right?

4925
03:04:28,840 --> 03:04:30,240
They changed the...

4926
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:31,140
laws, right?

4927
03:04:31,400 --> 03:04:33,100
I'm pretty sure it's a lot easier now.

4928
03:04:34,920 --> 03:04:35,460
Um...

4929
03:04:36,100 --> 03:04:36,520
But...

4930
03:04:36,520 --> 03:04:37,020
Yeah.

4931
03:04:37,340 --> 03:04:38,180
There he is.

4932
03:04:38,720 --> 03:04:39,180
Um...

4933
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:40,220
But yeah, that's what I...

4934
03:04:40,220 --> 03:04:42,580
It just brought back memories and stuff.

4935
03:04:42,940 --> 03:04:43,300
Yeah.

4936
03:04:43,400 --> 03:04:44,060
Much easier.

4937
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:45,180
That's good to know.

4938
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:47,360
Um...

4939
03:04:48,040 --> 03:04:48,560
Let's see.

4940
03:04:50,620 --> 03:04:51,640
I saw...

4941
03:04:51,640 --> 03:04:54,400
Doki, I saw the same unfinished Wolverine movie.

4942
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:55,760
Thank you for the super chat, Monks.

4943
03:04:55,860 --> 03:04:56,120
Thank you.

4944
03:04:56,280 --> 03:04:56,780
Thank you.

4945
03:04:58,940 --> 03:04:59,460
Uh...

4946
03:05:00,140 --> 03:05:00,740
Let's see.

4947
03:05:05,270 --> 03:05:05,710
Uh...

4948
03:05:05,710 --> 03:05:06,150
Jay...

4949
03:05:06,150 --> 03:05:06,390
Uh...

4950
03:05:06,390 --> 03:05:06,850
LeCone.

4951
03:05:06,970 --> 03:05:07,890
Thank you for the super chat.

4952
03:05:08,030 --> 03:05:08,250
Thank you.

4953
03:05:08,390 --> 03:05:08,970
Thank you.

4954
03:05:09,850 --> 03:05:11,410
What surprised me is that...

4955
03:05:11,410 --> 03:05:14,370
I revisited one of the shops when seeing family in Hong Kong.

4956
03:05:14,550 --> 03:05:17,950
And they're still doing a brisk trade even in the modern digital era.

4957
03:05:18,270 --> 03:05:19,270
Thank you for the super chat.

4958
03:05:19,390 --> 03:05:19,650
Thank you.

4959
03:05:19,790 --> 03:05:20,430
Thank you.

4960
03:05:21,510 --> 03:05:22,290
That's funny.

4961
03:05:22,530 --> 03:05:23,510
That's silly thing.

4962
03:05:23,510 --> 03:05:24,370
Um...

4963
03:05:24,370 --> 03:05:33,790
I feel like cause like now that Steam is more accessible, and it's a lot easier now to get games these days, that I feel like, you know, people don't have to do this anymore.

4964
03:05:34,210 --> 03:05:35,430
Cause like for...

4965
03:05:35,430 --> 03:05:40,830
Like back then, when I was growing up, it was more so like the lack of accessibility.

4966
03:05:41,430 --> 03:05:41,770
You know?

4967
03:05:41,770 --> 03:05:43,930
It was just harder to...

4968
03:05:44,530 --> 03:05:45,010
Like...

4969
03:05:45,010 --> 03:05:47,130
Play the games that we wanted to play.

4970
03:05:48,210 --> 03:05:49,650
Cause like I try to...

4971
03:05:49,650 --> 03:05:50,050
You know...

4972
03:05:50,050 --> 03:05:50,350
Every...

4973
03:05:50,350 --> 03:05:51,050
I do try...

4974
03:05:51,050 --> 03:05:51,510
I try...

4975
03:05:51,510 --> 03:05:51,830
I...

4976
03:05:51,830 --> 03:05:52,770
Um...

4977
03:05:52,770 --> 03:05:56,770
We traveled a lot to Hong Kong so I can buy like video games and stuff too.

4978
03:05:57,130 --> 03:06:00,250
Well, I try to buy video games and movies that I wanna watch.

4979
03:06:06,430 --> 03:06:09,890
Yeah, it used to be like the only option because of accessibility.

4980
03:06:14,550 --> 03:06:15,230
Yeah.

4981
03:06:15,530 --> 03:06:17,910
I think that's why Spotify was invented.

4982
03:06:18,390 --> 03:06:19,830
I don't know if you guys know this.

4983
03:06:20,150 --> 03:06:20,370
I...

4984
03:06:20,370 --> 03:06:22,190
I recently found out Spotify was...

4985
03:06:22,190 --> 03:06:23,230
Was made by...

4986
03:06:23,830 --> 03:06:24,510
The Swedish?

4987
03:06:25,190 --> 03:06:25,850
I think?

4988
03:06:26,910 --> 03:06:29,290
Was it the Swedish that invented Spotify?

4989
03:06:30,810 --> 03:06:31,490
Um...

4990
03:06:32,210 --> 03:06:32,570
But...

4991
03:06:33,210 --> 03:06:33,650
Um...

4992
03:06:33,650 --> 03:06:38,690
That's why like piracy only comes about when things are not accessible.

4993
03:06:40,490 --> 03:06:41,130
But...

4994
03:06:41,130 --> 03:06:41,890
Basically...

4995
03:06:41,890 --> 03:06:42,870
I recently learned that...

4996
03:06:42,870 --> 03:06:43,670
This lore...

4997
03:06:43,670 --> 03:06:44,590
About Spotify.

4998
03:06:45,830 --> 03:06:46,470
But...

4999
03:06:46,470 --> 03:06:47,150
Um...

5000
03:06:47,150 --> 03:06:48,250
Back then...

5001
03:06:48,250 --> 03:06:48,810
Um...

5002
03:06:48,810 --> 03:06:50,090
Pirate Bay was everywhere.

5003
03:06:50,430 --> 03:06:51,990
And people were just like...

5004
03:06:51,990 --> 03:06:52,690
What was it?

5005
03:06:52,850 --> 03:06:55,910
Pirate Bay or LimeWire songs that that one...

5006
03:06:55,910 --> 03:06:57,350
Or Torrent songs and stuff.

5007
03:06:57,550 --> 03:06:58,990
To listen to their songs.

5008
03:06:59,410 --> 03:07:00,250
And then...

5009
03:07:00,250 --> 03:07:00,510
Um...

5010
03:07:00,510 --> 03:07:02,510
Pirate Bay went through like several lawsuits.

5011
03:07:02,830 --> 03:07:03,430
Because like...

5012
03:07:03,430 --> 03:07:03,710
You know...

5013
03:07:03,710 --> 03:07:05,550
From music producers and music...

5014
03:07:05,550 --> 03:07:06,750
Music label companies.

5015
03:07:06,970 --> 03:07:07,650
Because people were like...

5016
03:07:07,650 --> 03:07:08,710
You're taking away...

5017
03:07:08,710 --> 03:07:09,770
Money from the...

5018
03:07:11,050 --> 03:07:11,490
Um...

5019
03:07:11,490 --> 03:07:12,490
From the artists!

5020
03:07:13,530 --> 03:07:16,070
When they're mostly taking money away from...

5021
03:07:16,490 --> 03:07:16,710
Uh...

5022
03:07:16,710 --> 03:07:18,450
From music label companies.

5023
03:07:18,570 --> 03:07:20,710
Because music label companies are like a scam sometimes.

5024
03:07:20,950 --> 03:07:21,230
But...

5025
03:07:21,230 --> 03:07:22,090
But that was back then.

5026
03:07:22,110 --> 03:07:23,150
I think they're a lot better now.

5027
03:07:23,310 --> 03:07:24,490
But I know like back then...

5028
03:07:24,490 --> 03:07:26,470
Music label companies were like...

5029
03:07:26,470 --> 03:07:27,170
Very predatory.

5030
03:07:27,490 --> 03:07:28,270
But they're like...

5031
03:07:28,270 --> 03:07:29,850
I think they're a lot better now.

5032
03:07:29,930 --> 03:07:30,270
I don't know.

5033
03:07:30,310 --> 03:07:31,790
I know they went through a lot of lawsuits.

5034
03:07:32,230 --> 03:07:33,750
Especially with the whole Kesha situation.

5035
03:07:34,130 --> 03:07:36,170
So I heard they're a lot better now.

5036
03:07:36,170 --> 03:07:38,410
Obviously, they're still pretty predatory.

5037
03:07:38,690 --> 03:07:42,710
But anyway, funny fact.

5038
03:07:43,670 --> 03:08:04,990
The reason why Spotify came to be was because people were... got tired of pirating stuff because they're like... they're like... people were like... the people who developed Spotify was like, why pirate when the free version, the legal version, is a lot easier and more accessible.

5039
03:08:04,990 --> 03:08:07,990
And that's why Spotify blew up.

5040
03:08:08,270 --> 03:08:17,530
Because people, in general, they would rather... if there was an... if it was legal and it was easier to access, then people would get it legally.

5041
03:08:18,010 --> 03:08:25,510
But because of the... because things are... when things aren't accessible, then they have to turn to the option of pirating.

5042
03:08:25,830 --> 03:08:32,230
And that's why Spotify became like, you know, the gigantic multi-million dollar company that it is today.

5043
03:08:32,230 --> 03:08:43,070
Because, like, it was just... easier to listen to it legally and buying a subscription... than, um... than just, like, doing it illegally and stuff.

5044
03:08:43,590 --> 03:08:43,730
Yeah.

5045
03:08:48,360 --> 03:08:52,660
Yeah, they didn't know what the legal version needed to reach and lock and go back to downloading... yeah, that's so true.

5046
03:08:55,180 --> 03:08:55,580
Um...

5047
03:08:55,580 --> 03:08:58,540
Yeah, it's also why piracy dropped that scene became popular in video games.

5048
03:08:58,720 --> 03:09:02,000
And why piracy picked up again when publishers started attacking...

5049
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,260
like, accesses and ownership and such.

5050
03:09:04,440 --> 03:09:05,140
I'm not surprised.

5051
03:09:05,380 --> 03:09:11,040
Like I said, like, um... usually people pirate only because, like, it's just things that aren't, like, easily accessible.

5052
03:09:11,820 --> 03:09:14,740
Um... it's just, like... just a pattern, in general.

5053
03:09:16,260 --> 03:09:16,720
Uh...

5054
03:09:16,720 --> 03:09:18,060
Lotta, thank you for the super chat.

5055
03:09:18,160 --> 03:09:18,980
Thank you, thank you.

5056
03:09:20,200 --> 03:09:21,620
I'm regionblocked from... oof.

5057
03:09:21,800 --> 03:09:22,400
That sucks.

5058
03:09:23,660 --> 03:09:25,520
Um... even then, I just listen to...

5059
03:09:25,520 --> 03:09:26,940
I don't... I don't...

5060
03:09:26,940 --> 03:09:28,660
use Spotify, really.

5061
03:09:29,100 --> 03:09:30,380
Because, like, for me...

5062
03:09:31,220 --> 03:09:31,780
Um...

5063
03:09:31,780 --> 03:09:35,560
I mostly listen to instrumental music when I'm working.

5064
03:09:35,920 --> 03:09:37,920
Because, like, I have no time...

5065
03:09:37,920 --> 03:09:39,860
Like, when I listen to music, what...

5066
03:09:39,860 --> 03:09:40,460
So, like...

5067
03:09:40,460 --> 03:09:43,840
I just YouTube, like, a playlist of instrumental music when I'm working.

5068
03:09:44,060 --> 03:09:44,720
So, like, I normally...

5069
03:09:44,720 --> 03:09:46,120
I don't normally use Spotify.

5070
03:09:47,860 --> 03:09:48,420
Uh...

5071
03:09:48,420 --> 03:09:49,800
And then, what about my phone?

5072
03:09:50,060 --> 03:09:52,380
Well, my phone is filled with...

5073
03:09:52,380 --> 03:09:54,540
I used to buy albums and stuff, back then.

5074
03:09:55,180 --> 03:09:55,640
Um...

5075
03:09:55,640 --> 03:09:58,080
So, my phone is just filled with, like...

5076
03:09:58,080 --> 03:09:58,980
Legally owned...

5077
03:09:58,980 --> 03:10:00,400
Legally owned music.

5078
03:10:01,120 --> 03:10:02,560
That I actually bought.

5079
03:10:03,920 --> 03:10:04,520
Um...

5080
03:10:04,520 --> 03:10:06,620
And also, like...

5081
03:10:06,620 --> 03:10:08,600
Tumblr songs that I downloaded.

5082
03:10:09,220 --> 03:10:11,940
That may not be legal, but...

5083
03:10:19,300 --> 03:10:22,080
That may or may not be legal, but, like...

5084
03:10:22,580 --> 03:10:23,540
It's there.

5085
03:10:27,520 --> 03:10:28,480
Back when...

5086
03:10:28,480 --> 03:10:30,320
Tumblr had a music player.

5087
03:10:30,740 --> 03:10:34,080
And you'd be like, Oh, that's a funky song that people made.

5088
03:10:39,800 --> 03:10:42,780
To be fair, they were mostly, like, mashups, you know?

5089
03:10:42,860 --> 03:10:45,420
I don't remember if people remember those times on Tumblr.

5090
03:10:46,480 --> 03:10:46,960
Um...

5091
03:10:46,960 --> 03:10:48,720
But, there were a lot of, like...

5092
03:10:48,720 --> 03:10:50,040
Like, there was a phase.

5093
03:10:50,380 --> 03:10:51,280
There was a fad.

5094
03:10:51,280 --> 03:10:54,700
Where people were mashing up songs together.

5095
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:56,660
And posting it on Tumblr.

5096
03:10:57,100 --> 03:10:57,840
And, like...

5097
03:10:57,840 --> 03:10:59,780
There were some really, really good ones.

5098
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:01,480
I think, like, one of my favorite ones...

5099
03:11:02,480 --> 03:11:03,040
Um...

5100
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:05,300
There was one where it was...

5101
03:11:06,220 --> 03:11:06,780
Um...

5102
03:11:06,780 --> 03:11:09,160
It was Daft Punk and Steven Universe.

5103
03:11:09,440 --> 03:11:10,460
Let me see if I can pull it up.

5104
03:11:10,780 --> 03:11:11,460
I remember...

5105
03:11:11,460 --> 03:11:12,620
That one was from Tumblr.

5106
03:11:15,040 --> 03:11:15,480
Uh...

5107
03:11:15,480 --> 03:11:17,660
I actually have it on my phone, too.

5108
03:11:18,300 --> 03:11:18,420
Okay.

5109
03:11:18,560 --> 03:11:19,940
Daft Punk...

5110
03:11:24,860 --> 03:11:25,300
Steven...

5111
03:11:25,300 --> 03:11:26,040
Universe.

5112
03:11:27,120 --> 03:11:28,060
It's actually really...

5113
03:11:28,060 --> 03:11:28,460
Oh, it's here.

5114
03:11:28,460 --> 03:11:28,920
This one.

5115
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:31,040
I think it was this one.

5116
03:11:35,360 --> 03:11:36,500
I think it was this one.

5117
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:36,760
Yeah.

5118
03:11:37,720 --> 03:11:38,600
This one...

5119
03:11:38,600 --> 03:11:40,620
I have this one on my playlist.

5120
03:11:41,880 --> 03:11:43,340
There's the one I remember.

5121
03:11:43,640 --> 03:11:44,800
That was a mashup.

5122
03:11:44,800 --> 03:11:46,940
And then there was that...

5123
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:48,660
Um...

5124
03:11:48,660 --> 03:11:52,000
Oh, there's the other one with Daft Punk.

5125
03:11:52,240 --> 03:11:53,580
And it was with...

5126
03:11:53,580 --> 03:11:55,040
Another anime song.

5127
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:57,080
What was it?

5128
03:11:57,160 --> 03:11:58,800
It's, uh...

5129
03:11:58,800 --> 03:11:59,680
Mmm...

5130
03:11:59,680 --> 03:12:02,500
I remember I showed it to you guys on stream before.

5131
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:04,640
It was...

5132
03:12:04,640 --> 03:12:06,100
Get Lucky with...

5133
03:12:07,260 --> 03:12:08,580
With another...

5134
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:09,700
With an anime song.

5135
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:12,800
Get Lucky mashup.

5136
03:12:15,650 --> 03:12:17,510
Get Lucky mashup.

5137
03:12:18,550 --> 03:12:19,890
What was it?

5138
03:12:20,430 --> 03:12:21,670
It was so good.

5139
03:12:23,030 --> 03:12:24,910
No, no, no, no, no.

5140
03:12:24,990 --> 03:12:26,350
It was an anime song.

5141
03:12:27,110 --> 03:12:28,190
With Get Lucky.

5142
03:12:28,650 --> 03:12:29,670
I don't know...

5143
03:12:29,670 --> 03:12:30,530
Is it on YouTube?

5144
03:12:30,570 --> 03:12:31,570
I hope it's on YouTube.

5145
03:12:32,050 --> 03:12:33,890
I have it on my phone.

5146
03:12:34,790 --> 03:12:36,610
But I don't know if it's on YouTube.

5147
03:12:37,810 --> 03:12:39,030
Get Lucky.

5148
03:12:39,510 --> 03:12:41,630
Get Lucky mashup.

5149
03:12:44,550 --> 03:12:44,870
Uh...

5150
03:12:45,730 --> 03:12:47,110
What was it?

5151
03:12:47,510 --> 03:12:48,530
Does anyone remember?

5152
03:12:49,270 --> 03:12:52,230
It was Get Lucky with another song.

5153
03:12:53,190 --> 03:12:54,950
Does anyone remember which song?

5154
03:12:55,230 --> 03:12:55,990
Does anyone like...

5155
03:12:55,990 --> 03:12:57,270
Does anyone remember it?

5156
03:12:57,730 --> 03:12:59,590
It was with an anime song.

5157
03:12:59,850 --> 03:13:01,070
It was with a Japanese song.

5158
03:13:02,890 --> 03:13:05,190
And I know I showed it on stream before.

5159
03:13:05,490 --> 03:13:06,750
Alright, are you calm now?

5160
03:13:07,450 --> 03:13:08,550
Are you calm?

5161
03:13:09,290 --> 03:13:10,390
Just sitting on my lap.

5162
03:13:11,090 --> 03:13:12,170
Like, chilling on my lap.

5163
03:13:12,430 --> 03:13:12,550
Okay?

5164
03:13:12,950 --> 03:13:13,790
Calm now, right?

5165
03:13:14,770 --> 03:13:15,370
Yeah?

5166
03:13:15,990 --> 03:13:16,710
You're satisfied?

5167
03:13:16,710 --> 03:13:18,710
I swear to God, if he starts barking.

5168
03:13:20,710 --> 03:13:22,190
Alright, I'm gonna...

5169
03:13:22,190 --> 03:13:22,890
Okay.

5170
03:13:23,910 --> 03:13:25,990
Okay, I'm gonna, like...

5171
03:13:25,990 --> 03:13:27,510
Stop moving for a sec.

5172
03:13:27,810 --> 03:13:29,170
Because I'm gonna check my phone.

5173
03:13:29,350 --> 03:13:31,250
Because I do have it on my phone.

5174
03:13:31,250 --> 03:13:32,730
So maybe I can find it.

5175
03:13:33,890 --> 03:13:34,290
Okay.

5176
03:13:35,490 --> 03:13:36,910
I know I have it.

5177
03:13:39,870 --> 03:13:40,390
Uh...

5178
03:13:40,390 --> 03:13:41,910
Is it even called Get Lucky?

5179
03:13:48,190 --> 03:13:49,050
Is it not?

5180
03:13:49,390 --> 03:13:49,810
Oh, wait.

5181
03:13:50,050 --> 03:13:50,210
Okay.

5182
03:13:51,490 --> 03:13:52,390
Is it...

5183
03:13:55,150 --> 03:13:56,210
Is it this one?

5184
03:13:59,830 --> 03:14:01,190
Oh, is it this one?

5185
03:14:01,450 --> 03:14:03,570
Okay, I'm worried that, like...

5186
03:14:05,670 --> 03:14:07,030
I wonder if it's this one.

5187
03:14:07,750 --> 03:14:08,450
Is it Get Lucky?

5188
03:14:08,570 --> 03:14:10,030
It has to be Get Lucky, right?

5189
03:14:11,530 --> 03:14:13,390
I'm pretty sure it was Get Lucky.

5190
03:14:13,570 --> 03:14:15,150
Unless it was another one.

5191
03:14:15,530 --> 03:14:16,410
Daft Punk.

5192
03:14:17,050 --> 03:14:17,750
Mashup.

5193
03:14:19,490 --> 03:14:20,190
Anime.

5194
03:14:22,510 --> 03:14:25,570
If all fails, put anime at the bottom.

5195
03:14:28,790 --> 03:14:31,910
I swear to God, it was another song?

5196
03:14:32,710 --> 03:14:33,810
It could be.

5197
03:14:34,370 --> 03:14:35,030
I don't know.

5198
03:14:35,250 --> 03:14:36,390
Now I'm, like...

5199
03:14:36,390 --> 03:14:37,710
Now I'm doubting myself.

5200
03:14:38,070 --> 03:14:39,710
I'm Get Lucky Kiki Slider.

5201
03:14:40,150 --> 03:14:40,650
Okay.

5202
03:14:41,610 --> 03:14:41,790
Okay.

5203
03:14:47,280 --> 03:14:48,620
I'm looking at my library.

5204
03:14:48,880 --> 03:14:50,240
Just to see if I can find it.

5205
03:14:52,340 --> 03:14:52,760
Songs.

5206
03:14:53,880 --> 03:14:55,780
Show me Daft Punk songs in my phone.

5207
03:14:57,220 --> 03:14:57,880
Oh my God.

5208
03:14:57,980 --> 03:15:01,600
I have Megalovania versus Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.

5209
03:15:01,600 --> 03:15:17,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

5210
03:15:17,380 --> 03:15:23,980
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha Dad's being an asshole right now.

5211
03:15:24,920 --> 03:15:26,560
I guess we'll never know.

5212
03:15:27,420 --> 03:15:29,700
It was so good, though.

5213
03:15:30,480 --> 03:15:31,120
Okay.

5214
03:15:32,080 --> 03:15:34,880
I know it was really cute.

5215
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:36,260
It was a really good song.

5216
03:15:36,580 --> 03:15:39,080
I can't remember it on the top of my head.

5217
03:15:40,180 --> 03:15:42,320
I'm looking through my phone, too.

5218
03:15:44,140 --> 03:15:46,780
I think he just wants to be fed earlier.

5219
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:48,360
Is this one?

5220
03:15:50,520 --> 03:15:51,160
Okay.

5221
03:15:56,340 --> 03:15:57,440
Is this one?

5222
03:15:59,320 --> 03:15:59,800
No!

5223
03:16:03,720 --> 03:16:08,860
He just... No, he just wants to be... He just wants to be fed early.

5224
03:16:10,040 --> 03:16:11,380
He's a... Wait, is this?

5225
03:16:14,560 --> 03:16:18,600
Oh my god, I'm like, looking through my playlist to try and find this.

5226
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:24,700
Guys, I'm sorry.

5227
03:16:25,980 --> 03:16:27,820
I'll never find it.

5228
03:16:28,120 --> 03:16:30,740
I'll never find it.

5229
03:16:31,660 --> 03:16:33,740
It's lost in history.

5230
03:16:34,280 --> 03:16:36,640
It was a... It was cute.

5231
03:16:36,820 --> 03:16:38,700
It was a cute song, too.

5232
03:16:39,220 --> 03:16:41,420
I know it was Daft Punk.

5233
03:16:42,120 --> 03:16:44,040
So, I'm like, what happened?

5234
03:16:47,940 --> 03:16:49,640
Where did it go?

5235
03:16:53,260 --> 03:16:55,420
Was Get Lucky the only...

5236
03:16:55,420 --> 03:16:56,660
Wait, let me double check.

5237
03:16:57,700 --> 03:16:59,780
Get Lucky is a song by...

5238
03:17:00,960 --> 03:17:02,520
What album was it?

5239
03:17:03,860 --> 03:17:05,940
It wasn't Lose Yourself to Dance.

5240
03:17:05,940 --> 03:17:07,800
It was with Pharrell Williams.

5241
03:17:07,800 --> 03:17:09,880
I know it was...

5242
03:17:09,880 --> 03:17:10,800
This is what...

5243
03:17:11,380 --> 03:17:12,140
Yeah, it's so...

5244
03:17:12,140 --> 03:17:12,900
Maybe it got re...

5245
03:17:12,900 --> 03:17:13,400
Maybe.

5246
03:17:13,760 --> 03:17:14,340
I don't know.

5247
03:17:14,740 --> 03:17:16,720
I don't know if it got removed or not.

5248
03:17:16,880 --> 03:17:17,400
Mashup.

5249
03:17:17,980 --> 03:17:19,760
I just knew it was like...

5250
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:21,000
It was really good.

5251
03:17:21,380 --> 03:17:22,540
That's all I remember.

5252
03:17:23,020 --> 03:17:24,700
It was with an anime...

5253
03:17:24,700 --> 03:17:26,340
It was with a Japanese song, too.

5254
03:17:26,660 --> 03:17:27,200
But...

5255
03:17:27,200 --> 03:17:30,000
I can't seem to find it on my...

5256
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:31,100
On my playlist.

5257
03:17:31,640 --> 03:17:32,700
I don't know.

5258
03:17:35,820 --> 03:17:36,760
Oh, well.

5259
03:17:37,080 --> 03:17:38,160
Maybe one day.

5260
03:17:39,980 --> 03:17:42,200
Maybe one day I'll find it.

5261
03:17:42,900 --> 03:17:43,580
For now.

5262
03:17:44,380 --> 03:17:45,160
For now.

5263
03:17:45,780 --> 03:17:47,800
For now it'll be lost in time.

5264
03:17:48,320 --> 03:17:49,140
I know I...

5265
03:17:49,140 --> 03:17:51,060
I know I showed it on stream before.

5266
03:17:51,560 --> 03:17:52,900
A long time ago.

5267
03:17:54,080 --> 03:17:55,120
I know I...

5268
03:17:55,120 --> 03:17:57,600
I remember I showed it on stream.

5269
03:17:57,900 --> 03:18:00,060
So I don't know if any lore masters...

5270
03:18:00,700 --> 03:18:01,540
Remember it.

5271
03:18:08,750 --> 03:18:10,810
I can't remember.

5272
03:18:13,050 --> 03:18:14,490
One day...

5273
03:18:14,490 --> 03:18:15,990
One of us will remember.

5274
03:18:16,470 --> 03:18:18,110
One day, guys.

5275
03:18:18,350 --> 03:18:20,450
I know one of us will remember.

5276
03:18:24,540 --> 03:18:26,080
Actual lost media.

5277
03:18:28,580 --> 03:18:30,380
You know what's a classic, though?

5278
03:18:31,240 --> 03:18:31,540
Oops.

5279
03:18:32,380 --> 03:18:32,600
Classic.

5280
03:18:33,720 --> 03:18:34,520
Like...

5281
03:18:34,520 --> 03:18:38,040
The classic is the Snoop Dog...

5282
03:18:38,040 --> 03:18:40,120
The Snoop Dog...

5283
03:18:40,120 --> 03:18:41,240
Bittersweet song.

5284
03:18:41,500 --> 03:18:42,980
Snoop Dog...

5285
03:18:44,420 --> 03:18:45,820
Snoop Dog...

5286
03:18:45,820 --> 03:18:46,160
Sugar...

5287
03:18:46,160 --> 03:18:46,860
Spice...

5288
03:18:50,460 --> 03:18:52,300
A surprise.

5289
03:18:56,300 --> 03:18:58,460
Snoop Dog...

5290
03:18:58,460 --> 03:18:58,980
Snoop Dog...

5291
03:18:58,980 --> 03:19:00,480
Surprise...

5292
03:19:00,480 --> 03:19:01,940
Song...

5293
03:19:01,940 --> 03:19:02,740
Surprise...

5294
03:19:02,740 --> 03:19:04,560
Snoop Dogg, Mashup.

5295
03:19:04,680 --> 03:19:05,900
I want to listen to that song again.

5296
03:19:06,580 --> 03:19:07,300
What was it called?

5297
03:19:08,780 --> 03:19:12,060
Does anyone remember what that song was called?

5298
03:19:13,480 --> 03:19:14,040
Blend?

5299
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:15,380
Yeah, Blend W.

5300
03:19:15,780 --> 03:19:16,780
That's a classic.

5301
03:19:17,860 --> 03:19:19,180
I love the internet.

5302
03:19:21,540 --> 03:19:22,800
A true classic.

5303
03:19:28,780 --> 03:19:29,340
Surprise?

5304
03:19:29,480 --> 03:19:29,980
What does this say?

5305
03:19:30,020 --> 03:19:30,380
Surprise!

5306
03:19:33,660 --> 03:19:38,280
I love the song.

5307
03:19:47,700 --> 03:19:50,980
If I could, I'll sing this at a concert.

5308
03:19:55,630 --> 03:20:00,100
I hope one day I can sing this at a concert.

5309
03:20:01,700 --> 03:20:03,100
Did you know?

5310
03:20:04,520 --> 03:20:09,320
Did you know the co-founder of Yishoujo made this video?

5311
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:10,840
Did you guys...

5312
03:20:10,840 --> 03:20:13,320
Did you guys know that?

5313
03:20:14,520 --> 03:20:20,340
The co-founder of Yishoujo actually made this shitpost.

5314
03:20:20,340 --> 03:20:23,220
Yeah, that's so wild.

5315
03:20:23,540 --> 03:20:24,560
Yeah, yeah.

5316
03:20:24,560 --> 03:20:24,920
Oh, Jesus He or she, how?

5317
03:20:24,920 --> 03:20:24,920
Yeah,

5318
03:20:29,080 --> 03:20:32,080
I don't know.

5319
03:20:40,710 --> 03:20:41,110
He's totally okay.

5320
03:20:41,130 --> 03:20:41,210
We will sing...

5321
03:20:41,910 --> 03:20:43,090
But he's too much.

5322
03:20:44,090 --> 03:20:44,410
Mom goes again!

5323
03:20:58,930 --> 03:21:02,410
I think that's like... Honestly, that's like a classic.

5324
03:21:02,630 --> 03:21:06,510
Anyway, guys... Anyway, guys, I'm gonna call it here because we have another stream later today.

5325
03:21:07,830 --> 03:21:09,790
I didn't make the waiting room for it yet.

5326
03:21:10,570 --> 03:21:13,130
So, I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me, everybody!

5327
03:21:14,450 --> 03:21:16,090
All right, guys, I had a fun time!

5328
03:21:17,310 --> 03:21:20,210
Dad's just me, little asshole, because he wants to be fed an hour early.

5329
03:21:20,370 --> 03:21:26,110
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5330
03:21:26,230 --> 03:21:29,570
And if you suffer me, head to bed, because you deserve it!

5331
03:21:29,650 --> 03:21:30,910

Bye, guys!
