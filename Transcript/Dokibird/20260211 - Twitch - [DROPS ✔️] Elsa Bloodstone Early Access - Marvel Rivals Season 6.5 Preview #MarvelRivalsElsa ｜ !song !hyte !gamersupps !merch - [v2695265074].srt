1
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,960
Whoa, oh, oh, wrong one.

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,600
Give me a sec.

3
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,220
Give me a sec.

4
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,340
I was like, I was all over the place.

5
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,860
I was really all over the place today.

6
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,360
Give me a sec.

7
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,840
Let me fix this real quick.

8
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,160
It's okay.

9
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,640
It's okay.

10
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,740
We still have five more minutes to the sponsored portion.

11
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,560
So it's all right.

12
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,600
I have time for, I have room for air.

13
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,060
I have five more minutes till the, till it's time for the
sponsored portion.

14
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,220
I'm all over the place.

15
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,020
All right, give me a sec.

16
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,300
Oh my gosh.

17
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,100
Oh my gosh.

18
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,900
I got so distracted, guys.

19
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,100
I actually got really distracted because I was like, Twitter
changed.

20
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,500
I was like, no!

21
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,360
What happened to Twitter?

22
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,920
And then I was like focused on that.

23
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,920
And I was like, okay, I should look at other.

24
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,340
And I was like, oh my God, why is Twitter so different?

25
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,080
different while i was i was trying to figure that out and
then i forgot about it's like oh yeah i have a stream today

26
00:04:49,080 --> 00:05:00,640
i i literally had started my stream i was i was so
preoccupied with the fact that my my game looked different

27
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:10,120
um i'm sorry my my twitter feed looked different today so
for those who didn't know um for those who didn't know uh

28
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:19,500
twitter has night mode but you could the color of what of
your night mode so the color of my twitter feed was the same

29
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:28,380
as my twitter as my mobile twitter which was dark blue so i
was just but then because i don't like it being pure black

30
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:36,280
because i like a little bit of color in there i don't know
it just it's less depressing when i'm on night mode you know

31
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:46,140
um it's like less depressing when it's like when it's not
full on just pure so I like having just a little bit of

32
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:53,580
color to the darkness so I have it dark blue so because like
you know like the sky you know like the night sky when you

33
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:07,360
look out there so I can I can simulate being outside instead
of being a degenerate in my PC room like you know I'm trying

34
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:17,360
to like you know be a little bit like a little bit of a
simulation of of the outside but now it's pure darkness and

35
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,720
that fucked with me and i was like i don't like that i was
just like oh i don't i don't like that it's just full on

36
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:31,060
black with no color to it but now you can't even choose
anymore you can't even choose it's like light mode or dark

37
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:40,900
mode and it's crazy i was just like no they took the choice
away from me yeah like the midnight blue color um anyway so

38
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:49,760
that freaked me out and i was trying to figure out how to
fix it but there's no fix there's and i was like wait there

39
00:06:49,760 --> 00:07:01,580
is no fixing so so i'm like why change it though what good
does it do like oh i'm sorry did that take too much of your

40
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:09,860
fucking database or some like what was the point of removing
my rights for dark blue and i like how i'm saying all this

41
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:18,680
what about me on the screen um i just realized i wasn't even
on the screen while being incredibly passionate about the

42
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:33,380
about this um just the fucking voice in the background um
all right um i didn't even finish standing up i was so i was

43
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:40,860
just like it just took away all my attention that was like
the most important thing in my life at that time I was like

44
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:55,900
it's no where is my dark blue the voices are the voice of
God that speaks because they took away my my night mode it's

45
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:09,620
shouting into the void um anyway all right it is almost time
so let me pull this up um and then make sure the volume is

46
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,980
Okay, so give me a sec.

47
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,240
Make sure the volume stuff is okay.

48
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,940
Where do I normally set it up as?

49
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,260
We still have one minute before the official sponsored
portion starts.

50
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,980
Okay, 14.8.

51
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,060
There we go.

52
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,340
All right, so, oh, it's two now.

53
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,460
You know the drill.

54
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,460

Yay!

56
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:46,020
So as you guys know, this is the early season preview of
Elsa Bloodstone.

57
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,960
I keep messing up her name.

58
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,180
For some reason, I kept thinking it's Elsa Bloodworm and
then Elsa Bloodwood.

59
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,620
And then Elsa, I wrote like everything but Elsa Bloodstone.

60
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,200
At one point, I wrote like, I wrote like, what was it?

61
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:08,820
At one point, I thought her name was, was like, I think it
was like Emily Bloodwood or some shit.

62
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:19,540
Elsa Bloodborne I kept getting confused with her last name I
got the Elsa part right But I kept forgetting what her last

63
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:26,900
name is Anyway, she's very broken That was my honest opinion
when I first tried her out She is a duelist There's a bunch

wanted to show you guys but anyway let's go into practice

97
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:31,560
ring for Elsa bloodstone sorry so there's just she is pretty
her damage is pretty strong this is the fallout by the way

98
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:42,440
this is the so this is her damage I did try her a little bit
um but there is a combo but i don't know if i can do it

99
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:49,240
correctly let me read her thing again she is also like an
essay i got confused like there's there's a lot okay um

100
00:13:49,240 --> 00:14:02,980
there's there's there's a lot of information here um all
right so i need to show you this this one was crazy um all

101
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,500
right she has dash to her look at her cooldowns okay wait
i'll show you guys i'll show you guys the cooldowns her

102
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:18,900
cooldown is like look at that four seconds look at that
another dash another four second dash and then there's this

103
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:29,180
all right so um so that's like yeah so her cooldowns is
actually pretty insane not gonna lie uh but that's not the

104
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,920
craziest part so all right So you see this alt?

105
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,920
You're like, all right, that seems easily dodgeable, right?

106
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:46,440
In theory, in theory, you would think that this alt is,
like, easy to dodge.

107
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,660
In theory, let me kill her real fast, though.

108
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,060
All right, now let me show you this.

109
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,030
Okay, what?

110
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,430
In theory, it should be easy to dodge.

111
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,830
But, like, I don't know.

112
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,670
Wait.

113
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,450
I mean, it is.

114
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,190
He's thick as hell.

115
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,430
Let me get my cough drops.

116
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,450
that's her oath.

117
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,310
By the way, I figured this out, too.

118
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,370
So, you're like, all right, that's cool.

119
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,970
I mean, that's not cool.

120
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,130
Where the fuck did the thing, did she go?

121
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,070
Where did she go?

122
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,950
I need a killer to reset this.

123
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,190
Oh, there she, oh, wait, no, where is she?

124
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:54,070
Alright, so, um, oh my god, I need a reset.

125
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,510
Okay, so I'll just put Mag in there.

126
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,270
Alright, so I can shoot it, and then I can bring it back,
and I can still shoot it.

127
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,590
So, basically, you can technically shoot the killer.

128
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:19,830
character that's in the alt itself so that's very scary i
think like so i could do this and then i could shoot him

129
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:31,130
bring him back continue to shoot him and then kill him it
can grab as many people as you want in it so like it's very

130
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:39,550
scary especially if you're on brawl comp um i dps rejoice we
have another character for you It's not like you guys

131
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,650
already get everything.

132
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,610
So, and then...

133
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,170
Yep.

134
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,390
So I can grab as many people as...

135
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,690
And then now you're thinking, surely there's no...

136
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,750
Surely there's a range.

137
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,110
Well, ha ha ha ha.

138
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,210
Let me show you this.

139
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,010
Wait, let me see it.

140
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,730
Oh, man.

141
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,630
How far is he gonna go?

142
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,070
Whoa, that's pretty far.

143
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,030
Oh, let me...

144
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,170
Oh, come on, boy.

145
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,270
Come on.

146
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,710
good boy.

147
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,210
He has a range.

148
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,030
I tested it out last night.

149
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,110
He does have a range.

150
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,410
The range is yes.

151
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,810
But like it literally I think you can chuck it.

152
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:32,030
If you find a straight line with no obstacle in one map, you
can chuck it on one side of the map and to the other side.

153
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,210
That's the range.

154
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,450
The range is the map.

155
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,190
I have checked, tried it out.

156
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,650
He does stop eventually.

157
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,210
But it's like, it's pretty far.

158
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,750
I don't think there is a map that would be, like, far
enough.

159
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,490
Yeah, it's like, fetch, blah, fetch.

160
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,870
Anyway, so that's, I think the crazy part is just this.

161
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,050
Wait, not this part.

162
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,650
It's this part.

163
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,630
Like, you might be like, I'm totally safe.

164
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,950
But, like, you might not be.

165
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:11,170
You might think you're safe, but there's a possibility that
you are not.

166
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,590
In the...

167
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,230
The on is very scary.

168
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,650
He does stop eventually.

169
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,630
If he has an obstacle, he's dead.

170
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,130
So, yeah.

171
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,850
You can technically...

172
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,850
You can force the C9.

173
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,470
You can force the C9.

174
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,730
If everybody's, like, in front of you in the cart.

175
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,430
Yeah, you kidnap healers.

176
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,230
He can...

177
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,850
I mean, you can't...

178
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,070
You don't even kidnap the healers.

179
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,330
You can kill the healers.

180
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,150
Can you kill it?

181
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,090
That is a good question.

182
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:51,290
I I will have to say it I do not know But I feel like I feel
like if you kidnap enough people like how are you gonna kill

183
00:18:51,290 --> 00:19:02,810
it It has 500 okay so apparently has 500 HP so you just
gotta hope that everybody shoots it but like all the people

184
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:10,010
that got kidnapped are the people that can kill it because
um If all the DPS gets kidnapped good luck to the supports

185
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:16,870
on saving you Good luck if you think your supports are going
to kill that.

186
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,250
Yeah, let's hope that you kill it before it grabs you.

187
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,050
But even then, it's pretty scary.

188
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:30,930
I think if you get grabbed, it's sort of like, it's sort of
GG's at that point if you get grabbed.

189
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,010
IMO.

190
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,730
I got shoot.

191
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,970
It's like when you look up the Phoenix song, you're like,
gosh, shoot the Phoenix song, shoot it.

192
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,210
And then you find out.

193
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:50,610
you were the only one that shot the phoenix all you know
stuff like that you know silly things like that all right

194
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:57,510
let me see dash forward your next double blaster becomes a
monster dash forward gaining bonus help and launching

195
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:04,990
enemies hip follow up with a double shot that prepares tells
you backwards using otter stage empowers your next smoky

196
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:12,770
snare launch a trap containing the monster diablo once it
becomes invincible and invulnerable Okay, all right, so I

197
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,370
saw this.

198
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,390
This one's crazy.

199
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:21,050
Fire a living bullet round that splits upon seeking nearby
enemies and making each with a spectral sigil.

200
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:32,830
Hitting mark targets with double barrel blastered and grants
living bullets deal extra damage to shields and enemies with

201
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,090
bullets.

202
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,930
Okay, she's very strong.

203
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,330
Dealing damage increases.

204
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,530
Hunting instincts defeating enemy caught by smoky snares.

205
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:49,370
additional higher instance okay so so you see the little
thing at the bottom um the more the more orange you have

206
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:56,350
this only resets the little thing the um it only resets when
you die so you keep this forever the little orange thing and

207
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:03,650
that reduces your cooldown every okay so the snare thing is
actually pretty cool if the okay watch him watch apparently

208
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:09,930
it's invisible to him and then it grabs him and then you can
dash to it too but you only have a couple of seconds so like

209
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,070
i do this And then, don't worry, he's going to go over
there.

210
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,890
And, okay, I put it on the wrong side.

211
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,510
And then, boom!

212
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,110
So, it's an invisible mine.

213
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,950
I don't know what the range is for the dash yet.

214
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,970
But, yeah, so, basically, you can hide in a corner.

215
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,970
Or, like, you know, anti-dive.

216
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,830
And you're like, oh, he doesn't.

217
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,710
No, he doesn't.

218
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,650
And it's like, boom!

219
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:50,710
so that's a little scary if you do like really cool flanks
with this character i feel i'm still trying to remember the

220
00:21:50,710 --> 00:22:03,950
combo the combo was crazy um it was like what was it it was
like okay it was like this okay it was like you can

221
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:10,670
basically do a combo that kills a tank but i don't remember
but don't We'll do a combo that kills Luna instead and it

222
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:20,230
was like what it was like it's like this Or was it like But
she you could kill support super fast with a fucking combo

223
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:28,770
or some shit I don't know if I can do it correctly Like but
I know that if you hit your shots you can do a crazy-ass

224
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:39,310
combo Yeah, she's DPS Oh my god if I can get it correctly
Okay, never mind.

225
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,330
No, that's fast.

226
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,030
Wait, actually, that was pretty fast.

227
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:53,030
That was a... I'm fucking up my combo, but that's still
killed there pretty fast, though.

228
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:53,870
We have...

229
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,110
If I could get it correctly.

230
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,870
If I could get the combo.

231
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,320
Oh my god.

232
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,380
Wait, what the fuck?

233
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,300
Wait, oh my god, wait, what the fuck?

234
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,160
Wait a minute.

235
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,700
Wait a minute.

236
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,080
Okay, wait, wait.

237
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,260
That's actually, I was not expecting that.

238
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,940
All right, wait.

239
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,540
Wait, what?

240
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
Oh, okay.

241
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,020
Okay, that's a little scary.

242
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,740
Not gonna lie, especially the...

243
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,480
fling up.

244
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,680
Okay, so Eve flings people up, by the way.

245
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,020
Alright, I'll do it without the Eve flings people up.

246
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,760
So if I do...

247
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,220
Oh, yeah, there you go.

248
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,140
I did the combo.

249
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,900
That's...

250
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,720
Is that scary?

251
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,100
Is that a little scary, guys?

252
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't know.

253
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,900
There you go.

254
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,220
There you go.

255
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,780
I did it.

256
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,380
There you go.

257
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,280
That's the combo.

258
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,980
Yeah, that's... That's one of the combos that you can do.

259
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,600
So it's right click.

260
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,740
You could do that.

261
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,240
Or you could do... Oh, and I could do another.

262
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,040
I can do another click.

263
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,200
Yeah, so anyway, it's basically it's right click E.

264
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,840
There.

265
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,660
Right click E and then hit again.

266
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,240
Like a two second.

267
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,560
Yeah, that's really fast, by the way.

268
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,640
There we go.

269
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,560
And I get a shield, too.

270
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,900
Yeah, and that combo gives you a shield.

271
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,100
I can't wait to get insta killed by...

272
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,640
Alright, let's enable test it on, Luna.

273
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,460
Now that I remember the combo, it's alright.

274
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,800
Right click.

275
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:50,960
Oh.

276
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,340
Shouldn't have lived.

277
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,200
Yeah, you get a shield, too.

278
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,520
Alright.

279
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,380
There you go.

280
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,980
Yeah, so, goodbye, Luna.

281
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,720
Oh, wait.

282
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,720
Let me try out on a squishier character, too.

283
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,340
If I hit...

284
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,420
You see, if I was an actual DPS player, that would be
scarier.

285
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,240
Like...

286
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,800
I can't wait for it.

287
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
Oh my god.

288
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,300
If I was an actual DPS player, it'd be even scarier, guys.

289
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,980
Alright, let's see it.

290
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,880
Yeah, I can't wait for the DPS players to do this to me.

291
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,840
No, no, you're supposed to stall and then be the change.

292
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,120
Yeah, you see the vision, though.

293
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,820
You see the vision, exactly.

294
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
You see the vision.

295
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,380
I wonder if I could do, like, a shift on it.

296
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,340
Wait, actually, wait.

297
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,860
I could do, like, a double E, maybe, right?

298
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,920
Oh, wait, yeah, I can.

299
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,980
If I get him my E, too.

300
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,020
But if I do that, he's just dead.

301
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,640
I feel like, yeah.

302
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,420
Anyway, let's make it so...

303
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,240
Let's see Adam.

304
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,640
So what was about Adam?

305
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,020
Adam?

306
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,920
Wait, let's see.

307
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,080
Adam, apparently he can fly now.

308
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,160
Oh, my God.

309
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,300
Be the change you want to be.

310
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,360
Oh, my God.

311
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,650
Apparently he hovers.

312
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,510
Oh, my God.

313
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,390
And yet Magneto still can't fly.

314
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,430
And it...

315
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,270
Move it.

316
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,210
Woo.

317
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,310
What the fuck?

318
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,770
He can fucking fly.

319
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,350
Oh, my God.

320
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,470
They finally, he's finally the perfect human being.

321
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,550
I've seen enough and saw the nerf Adam again.

322
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,330
He decided super Adam.

323
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,570
Oh, Lord.

324
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,750
He coming.

325
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,650
For those who don't know, there's the cooldown is two
seconds, but it's also recharging the fuel.

326
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,730
I guess his legs got tired from floating.

327
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,990
We go break his legs again.

328
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,710

329
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,330
Why that's so fucking silly.

330
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,070
Can he respite air?

331
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,490
I assume so.

332
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:24,910
Yeah.

333
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,410

334
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,810
I can.

335
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,090
I can also hover.

336
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,790

337
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,610

338
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,690
Oh, no.

339
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,130

00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,850
No, don't do it.

341
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,890
I actually want to play Adam.

342
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,370
Adam Haines can fight.

343
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,970
Stop complaining.

344
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,010
We hear you.

345
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,430
We get out of that wheelchair.

346
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,850
It's a Christmas miracle.

347
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,870
You can fly now.

348
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,690

00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,390

357
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:50,450
is there any what other big changes that they do chat other
than those two other than um elsa and Adam.

358
00:28:52,670 --> 00:29:00,250
But honestly, Elsa, I mean, compared to Deadpool, Elsa isn't
like, doesn't have like super not a lot of different things.

359
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,970
Like, she's just, she's apparently a really fun DPS
character, from what I'm told.

360
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,830
Like, guys, she's a very fun hit scat.

361
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,030
I mean, like, this is really fun to do.

362
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,090
I feel that.

363
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:10,810
Like, this.

364
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,790
Like, that's really fun.

365
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:24,670
It won't be fun for me, but if you are a hit scat player, um
this will be very fun this will yeah i'm pretty sure this is

366
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:38,250
instant yeah no this is hit scan guys look it's literally
instant yeah it's like dps player don't worry we hear you we

367
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:50,750
always hear you um um i feel like i wonder like the dash
like i could Dash anywhere, basically.

368
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,230
Oh, yeah.

369
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,810
My Dash, like, increases my speed, too.

370
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:56,730
Yeah.

371
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,310
I forgot about that.

372
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,970
Yeah, see, it hits two, by the way.

373
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,250
The right click hits two bots.

374
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,250
Or, like, it splits up.

375
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,790
So it'll target, like, everyone around you.

376
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,930
Since it's AoE.

377
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,730
That is gonna...

378
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,770
I'm gonna be so scared.

379
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,750
I'm gonna...

380
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,170
I'm gonna be so scared.

381
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:24,990
I don't know the range of it but it didn't go to this spot
so I think you have to be close by for it what is her

382
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,150
ultimate watch this

383
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:37,090
like I said you can that's her ultimate you can shoot people
while they're trapped in there and also it immobilizes thing

384
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:47,390
as well so and I can bring her back and shoot it and you're
like oh that's cool the range is not that bad right and then

385
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,890
you're like oh yeah sure

386
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:08,730
so like you have to be like okay so this one this one i
think you're safe never mind so maybe here if you're here

387
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,630
all right where's the other bot if you're here you're safe
Never mind?

388
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,290
If you're, if you're here, you're safe.

389
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,990
If you're, there you go.

390
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,430
If you're here, you're safe, guys.

391
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,730
So this is the range between, I think, here maybe.

392
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:29,910
Nope.

393
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,630
Here you go.

394
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,510
If you're there, not there though, not there.

395
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,390
So, so that's the, that's the range.

396
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:49,990
it follows you it comes back if you press q so look at this
and then you see call back i can call him back so that's the

397
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:57,110
thing all right storm oh yeah there's new team ups almost
forgot i have like 10 more minutes before we'll show new

398
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:10,170
team ups too um two gets everything so i think it was like
what was it guys how do i pull them in Oh, there you go.

399
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,150
I can pull people in with my E now.

400
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,950
Yeah, so I can pull people in.

401
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,990
Can you do it in the air?

402
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,390
I'm pretty sure you can.

403
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,010
But, like, why would you be in...

404
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,170
I mean, you can't even want to get your streamer clips, I
guess.

405
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,150
Like, you see... You see an Ultron in the sky?

406
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,570
I'm pretty sure.

407
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:34,710
Alright, let's see.

408
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,030
Yeah.

409
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,850
Like, you don't have, like, a...

410
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,030
You don't have, like, a...

411
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:50,030
floating ability when you pull it off like Adam but you
could technically do that yeah oh yeah Reed has a rocket

412
00:32:50,030 --> 00:33:03,470
team up what was his team up they should pop Elsa so she can
make the monster jump what was the other team up uh receives

413
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:15,550
a removing his and letting him actively enter the inflation
mode wow wow So how do I activate inflation mode?

414
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,250
Is that it?

415
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,750
Is that inflation?

416
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,630
Oh, enlarge.

417
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,490
There we go.

418
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,370
Oh, so like, there it is.

419
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,170
The what?

420
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,110
Yeah, I'm like, the what mode?

421
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,650
Mr. Fantastic.

422
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,490
Keep that in your bedroom.

423
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,850
So basically, I can...

424
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,910
Okay, he can go inflation mode whenever he wants.

425
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,790
Now, they know what they are doing.

426
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:47,370
All right.

427
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:55,530
She also has her own team up, but I feel like it's not, you
don't really see it unless you're on the enemy team.

428
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,350
So targets with Deadpool's chatter while slowing.

429
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,810
So yeah, you don't really notice this unless you're that.

430
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,890
So like, they're basically distracted by Deadpool.

431
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:09,710
Yeah.

432
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,430
Anyway, so there's that, and then...

433
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,430
Oh, yeah, apparently the Fantastic Four broke up.

434
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:17,370
No!

435
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,510
Yeah.

436
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,990
They no longer have a team up together.

437
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,050
The bed's broken!

438
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,410
No!

439
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,110
Okay.

440
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,390
No!

441
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,830
I was going to go to their tour.

442
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,590
I thought they will have another tour.

443
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,550
Yeah, so...

444
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,030
Yeah, the thing joined...

445
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,690
The thing joined Hulk and Black Panther.

446
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,570
They can't split up, guys.

447
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,350
I can't believe it.

448
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,450
What happened?

449
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,870
All right, the thing.

450
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,790
The thing gains Gamma Gauntlet boosting damage and range of
his Rocky Jab.

451
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,670
Dealing damage with those grants bonus health.

452
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,770
So you have to do it.

453
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,190
But you have to do a team up with.

454
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,250
How far is this?

455
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,110
Wow!

456
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,070
That's a far range.

457
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,970
Okay, that range is far.

458
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:21,450
oh okay yeah that's the that's the range for that um and
then and then i believe you guys said that suit uh not uh

00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:11,270
marvel rivals preview nobody's day i don't think people they
realize i don't think they realize that um they changed it

497
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:19,470
to 30 minutes for the uh for the thing instead of the usual
the usual like what because you in the past we had one we

498
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:25,070
had one hour to look over everything but I think it's
because there's not a lot of big changes other like Elsa

499
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:35,170
herself is very she's very straightforward I feel like in
general honestly I feel she's very straightforward so like I

500
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:43,090
don't think there's like much to really show for one hour
compared to like compared to like the previous early access

501
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,550
yeah like yeah she's just like as long as you get

502
00:39:50,650 --> 00:40:05,870
like like and then we have that too like oh my god what wait
there's no way wait okay yeah she's too shot okay yeah yeah

503
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:11,990
she's not deadpool where you need like a fucking doctorate
to be able to understand what the fuck is going on oh no

504
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:19,070
adam thing is yeah oh no she's i saw a tweet there like i'm
not batting elsa because she's broken I'm banning her

505
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,530
because she's British.

506
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,610
All right, for those who want to know what her fistfly looks
like, watch this.

507
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,210
Finally!

508
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,470
The perfect human being!

509
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,370
The perfect specimen!

510
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,710
The perfect specimen is here.

511
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,570
No longer shall he be constrained in his wheelchair.

512
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,810
His recovery, it is a Christmas miracle.

513
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,850
He can fly!

514
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,000
He flies now!

515
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,420
Finally, he's been unleashed.

516
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,560
I've seen enough.

517
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,340
Nerf Adam.

518
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,280
I prayed for time like these.

519
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,200
And then I could do this and hover.

520
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
And then I can continue my flight.

521
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,620
I think that's always been the main complaint about Adam.

522
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,940
that he literally is like the slowest guy in the entire
roster like everyone has like some form of mobility to go in

523
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:38,440
and he's just there like like 20 miles behind the team can
you fly yes he can oh wait no he can't no he can't when

524
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:45,060
you're healed so that means you gotta stop healing there's a
simple solution for that just never heal

525
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:59,840
guys then you can fly forever i think you can hover okay the
shift is his if you're in shift form you can also but you

526
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:14,010
can you can heal while you're in shift form though he's dps
now he's ultron even better than ultron yeah when you use

527
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:22,830
any other when you attack you can fucking air bomb though
you can fly behind them be like fly behind him he's right

528
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:34,670
behind me isn't he and then get him from the sky right there
all right let me check plus one dive character he could yeah

529
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:42,070
you could technically just whoops all dive if you think
about it you could just have all dive all right streamer

530
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:49,770
mode is disabled oh that means i think everyone else is on
streamer mode okay i think everyone's heading over all right

531
00:42:49,770 --> 00:43:06,830
i think it's almost time time adam is finally real all right
let me let me set up yo guru so because i'm on your team now

00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:19,810
No.

649
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,090
No, it's okay.

650
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,670
Oh my gosh, the damage is crazy though.

651
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:25,690
Um.

652
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:29,670
We're so healthy.

653
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:30,530
Pin roll play.

654
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,890
Oh, you can shoot the trap before you even...

655
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:35,590
I saw it.

656
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:37,270
Oh, I have so bad, unfortunately.

657
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,610
Yeah, there's too much damage.

658
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:40,850
This Thing Hulk is terrifying.

659
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,750
I can't even lie to you.

660
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,330
Is Thing Hulk like the new tank lineup?

661
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,110
Wait, wait.

662
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,750
I mean, they got the Gamma team up now.

663
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:53,130
Does that mean we're getting our own Thing Hulk?

664
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:55,010
Maybe about after.

665
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,250
After Strange Alture.

666
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:58,410
Yeah, after Strange Alt.

667
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,590
That pull is so cheeky.

668
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:02,450
Oh, wait.

669
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,870
There is a hook behind us.

670
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,750
There's still a Hulk behind us.

671
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:08,870
All right, Malaya, that's on you.

672
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,430
Wait, Hulk behind us, I think, right?

673
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,790
I'm in the trap.

674
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,170
Is there a Hulk behind us?

675
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,310
I couldn't, I don't know.

676
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,190
I'm scared.

677
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:20,810
You're not scared.

678
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:21,270
I'm scared.

679
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,370

00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,090

681
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,050
Go tell him I said that.

682
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,890
There's a gap top.

683
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,090
Oh, it's so Adam.

684
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:33,770

No, no, no, no, no, you just fly right.

704
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:27,650

All of you!

710
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,290
That old is terrifying!

711
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,950
Apparently he has 500 HP, so you technically...

712
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,830
You could technically kill him.

713
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,850
Oh, my goodness, bro.

714
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:51,910
That thing owns...

715
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,050
That is scary.

716
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,250
Can you shoot it when you're getting charged?

717
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:56,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.

718
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,650
Not when you're in it, but your teammates can.

719
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,450
I'm really stunned.

720
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,950
I mean, why can't...

721
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,690
Moxie, let's relax here, bro.

722
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,330

724
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,710

00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:14,130
Oh, okay.

727
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,410
Where's the Orel?

728
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:18,150
Where is it, Moxie?

729
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:19,530

730
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,270

731
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:23,770
Oh, I got you.

732
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,470
I got you right here.

733
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,830
You can't shoot the little...

734
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:28,830
Oh.

735
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,090
The trap.

736
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:31,590
You cannot?

737
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:32,030
Right here.

738
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:32,650

00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:33,470

Dude, if that thing pulled me from the other side of the
vehicle, are you scrolling?

763
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,620
I don't think it's weird.

764
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,780
It was on the opposite side.

765
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,380

766
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:01,940

We wanted to see the duck, right?

838

839
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,440

01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,680
They had the read.

854
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,160
Wait, Punisher one, Punisher one.

855
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,860
I'm still bonding us in.

856
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:37,580
Get in there.

857
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,640
I'm scared now.

858
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,580
Oh my god.

859
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,240
It's going off the map.

860
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:41,920
It's going off the map.

861
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,020
Oh, no, it's not.

862
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,180
It's okay.

863
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,880
Oh, it's no longer okay.

864
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,500
Oh, thank you.

865
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:49,520
I'm snapping.

866
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,340
I'm getting smacked around.

867
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:51,460
I'm getting smacked.

868
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,280
I'm snapping.

869
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,900
I don't have snaps no more.

870
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,800
I don't have snaps no more.

871
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,260
I have two guys.

872
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,980
Two guys back here.

873
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,260

874
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:00,460
Don't worry.

01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,480
Nice, nice, nice.

876
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,340
Point again, point again.

877
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,020
I'm flying in to get you guys in.

878
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,600
There is a atom at the very top.

879
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,680
How much health does puffer have?

880
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,840
Yeah, right.

881
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,020
We have an atom in the middle of our...

882
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,240
Yeah, no, he's left.

883
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,880
I know how to handle this.

884
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,440
Just don't need to look at it.

885
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,500
Wait, I'm getting shot at by something.

886
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,920
It's happening.

887
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:24,740

It's okay.

894
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:03,910
We can all reset right here.

895
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,560
And Thing Hulk is actually insane.

896
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:12,720
Is it?

897
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,080
Yeah, it's crazy, yeah.

898
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,280
The range for the Thing and the Hulk.

899
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,690
We gotta get in there.

900
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:24,330
I'm scared too.

901
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,350
I don't know if it's gonna work, though.

902
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,570
Oh, that's true, that's true, that's smart.

903
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,490
Although, it's gonna be hard to do that.

904
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,570
Yeah, I'm gonna try here, though.

905
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:31,670
And whatever.

906
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840
Buffalo, Buffalo.

907
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,900
I think they have a res, don't they?

908
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:40,620
Beautiful Jeff.

909
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,660
Yeah, there it is.

910
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,960
The res is on the board.

911
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:45,680
He's dead.

912
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:46,120
He's dead.

913
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,480
Oh my god.

914
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,520
I still find it.

915
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,920
Oh my god.

916
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,260
No, I can't live.

917
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:55,700
No.

918
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:56,440
It res.

919
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,420
Oh, come on.

920
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:04,580
Nice.

921
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:06,440
Nice.

922
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:06,880
Good job.

923
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:08,460
We can push that.

924
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,440
I think, yeah, that's totally doable.

925
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:18,380
Every time I fly, the Hulk just grabs me from the skies
traumatizing.

926
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,080
So who said they're going Hulk and thing?

927
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:26,600
All right, wait.

928
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,600
No, we're not getting the gamma going?

929
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:28,700

Oh, goodbye.

You guys are... Yeah, yeah, we are.

955
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:07,170
They're gone.

956
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,510
Don't worry, the healers are still alive.

957
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,060
Yo, this might be the worst composition to run Hulk Femin 2.

958
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:19,620
Let's get him.

959
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:21,960
I believe.

960
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,500
This might be a really bad heal cop, too.

961
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,280
No, I don't know.

962
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:29,760
It's perfect.

963
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,080
Oh, wait.

Wait, strange is one.

1007
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,600
Yeah, strange little change little.

1008
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,240
Yeah, yeah, nice.

1009
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,020
Huge.

1010
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:20,620
Oh, no, not the gripper.

1011
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:21,840
Wait, who's portaling?

1012
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,520
Is that our portal?

1013
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,160
I have a portal.

1014
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:23,820
Don't let him touch me.

1015
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:24,840
They're gonna try to- Wait, wait.

1016
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,280
Angela, they're gonna touch you.

1017
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:26,940
They're gonna touch you.

1018
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,300
Yeah, I'm putting a chop right here.

1019
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,440
I like that.

1020
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,640
All right, I might swap off.

1021
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,780
I'm hearing a Hulk.

1022
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:35,440
Oh, shit.

1023
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:35,920
Stop TP.

1024
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,080
That's not just- That's not just any Hulk.

1025
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:38,700
Nice!

1026
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,160
That's the Tim Hulk.

1027
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,060
Are you going to be okay, Moxie?

1028
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,740
They're all chasing you right now.

1029
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:53,980
I save you.

1030
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,160
I only got...

1031
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,400
I can only get one person, though.

1032
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:57,480
Yeah, that's my bad.

1033
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,540
I don't have any more heals, though.

1034
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,160
I could die.

1035
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,080
Okay.

1036
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:09,180
I'm swapping.

1037
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:10,180
I'm swapping.

1038
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:13,020
What goes well with...

1039
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,600
Invis.

1040
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,600
They nerfed at Loki, right?

1041
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,600
They nerfed the bullets.

1042
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:21,940
Could that be...

1043
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:26,180
Oh, maybe Cloak for the counter of Elsa?

1044
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:28,960
Maybe.

1045
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,220
Oh, Tim?

1046
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,220
What are you doing?

1047
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,700
Why are you portaling me off the map?

1048
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,640
Why are you doing?

1049
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,520
I had to.

1050
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,820
That's why we were down a player the whole time.

1051
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,520
Yeah, that makes sense, actually.

1052
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,700
Oh, wait, that's him!

1053
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:57,180
That's him!

1054
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:57,960
It's good, it's good.

1055
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,400
Oh, my God.

1056
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,820
Did you get anyone?

1057
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,240
No, I tried to bring it back.

1058
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,520
Wow, well, here.

1059
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,530
I hope you guys will be okay.

1060
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:13,930
Okay, I'm lying to me.

1061
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:15,710
You know what I'm saying?

1062
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:18,370
I'm boker.

1063
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:21,710
I am so fucked up right now back here.

1064
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:23,010
I'm okay.

1065
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:24,030
Yeah.

1066
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,570
How about that, Puffer?

1067
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,030
Bro, do you see how fast Adam's flying in the air right
here?

1068
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:29,270
Look at me.

1069
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:31,350
Don't worry about it, bro.

1070
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:32,210
I love Puffer.

1071
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:32,970
Everything's fine.

1072
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:34,390
It's all good, man.

1073
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,470
Keep going.

1074
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:37,010
I'll just hear for the vibes, guys.

1075
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:38,050
Nice, Moxie.

1076
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:38,910
Good 1v1, bro.

1077
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,430
I'm here, I'm here.

1078
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:40,630
Let's go.

1079
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:41,870
I'm running, I'm low.

1080
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:42,750
Go, go fight him.

1081
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:43,710
I'm here, I'm right here.

1082
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:44,070
All right.

1083
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,210
Yeah, we believe in you.

1084
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:46,890
Oh, they're scared.

1085
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:48,910
Yeah, I still got you.

1086
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,010
What is going on here?

1087
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:52,090
I'm going in, I guess.

1088
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:52,390
Good action.

1089
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:54,170
Massive heals.

1090
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:56,830
Oh, oh, oh.

1091
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:57,750
Wow.

1092
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:58,390
You guys are fine.

1093
01:09:58,410 --> 01:09:58,750
Oh, my God.

1094
01:09:58,850 --> 01:09:59,050
You live.

1095
01:09:59,090 --> 01:09:59,310
You live.

1096
01:09:59,390 --> 01:09:59,550
You live.

1097
01:09:59,630 --> 01:09:59,750
You live.

1098
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,310
You love.

1099
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:01,030
Oh, thank you.

1100
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:01,770
Thank you.

1101
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:04,710
You're so healthy.

1102
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:09,700
Nice.

1103
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,380
See, he's so healthy.

1104
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,300
A moxie pocket.

1105
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,220
A moxie pocket.

1106
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,600
Guys, are we pushing the crow defending?

1107
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,260
I'm confused.

1108
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,940
That's how we play.

1109
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,320
Yeah.

1110
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,320
Oh, that crow.

1111
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,280
I can't kill him.

1112
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,400
This guy's unkillable.

1113
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,580
I've grabbed him three times.

1114
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:28,640
I got you.

1115
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:29,660
I got you.

1116
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,460
What was that?

1117
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,300
He's unkillable.

1118
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:34,380
Oh, there's a dust.

1119
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,840
Oh, it's a dust.

1120
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:37,640
It's a body.

1121
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:38,860
Yeah.

1122
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,400
Oh, Tim, be careful.

1123
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,180
He's portaling.

1124
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,460
Tim, be careful.

1125
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,140
He's portaling.

1126
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:52,000
They're all supporting the battle of the mines.

1127
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,520
Yeah, whose portal is gonna hit?

1128
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,360
Took you a really long time.

1129
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:02,340
Oh.

1130
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:03,480
Oh.

1131
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,760
What's going on there?

1132
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,320
I have a lot of first.

1133
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:08,820
There's a paper angle.

1134
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,320
That's a few people I think off the map.

1135
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:13,220
Oh!

1136
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:13,900
Oh, did you do it?

1137
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,480
Oh!

1138
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,220
Oh!

1139
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,700
Wait, I just won?

1140
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,780
No, I don't see anybody right now.

1141
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,120
Wait, I see the res.

1142
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,540
Guys, the res.

1143
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:27,520
Huge.

1144
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:28,640
Oh, nice.

1145
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,600
Nice up.

1146
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,000
Thank you.

1147
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,820
There's someone over here.

1148
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,380
Yeah, they are not winning.

1149
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,640
Oh, the items up top.

1150
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,740
Nice, good stuff.

1151
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,760
Nice, guys.

1152
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,360
Good round.

1153
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:44,940
Good round.

1154
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,200
GG's.

1155
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,260
See, we don't need a Punisher, guys.

1156
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:50,680
True, bro.

1157
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,160
That literally...

1158
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,440
But that guy farmed all so fast.

1159
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,620
Every fight, it felt like...

1160
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,860
Wait, so which Tim had the 25 finals?

1161
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,700
It was Guru, right?

1162
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:02,920
Mm-hmm.

1163
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,260
No.

1164
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,340
No, just checking.

1165
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,320
That was this Tim.

1166
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,340
Good shit, Goo.

1167
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,880
You gotta step it up, Tim.

1168
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:11,480
Okay, dude.

1169
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,040
Six finals is...

1170
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,460
That's really...

1171
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:16,100
How is Moxie stealing my MVP?

1172
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:23,500
Oh, wait, how do I have more finals than the other team?

1173
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,340
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1174
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,140
It's because you, it's because you soaked up all that damage
in my ult.

1175
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:29,700
Good job.

1176
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,020
You probably, literally.

1177
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,900
That's not me for the record.

1178
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:36,680
That's Guru.

1179
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,380
Actually, wait.

1180
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:38,780
Yeah, yeah.

1181
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:39,420
That funny joke.

1182
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,500
You can play it then.

1183
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,120
You can play it.

1184
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:41,600
No, I'll play it.

1185
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,380
Yeah, you can play it, man.

1186
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,180
Uh, no, I'll play.

1187
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:44,920
I want me.

1188
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:45,880
Shockborn.

1189
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:46,800
You're so stupid.

1190
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,280
I can do whatever.

1191
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,240

It's okay.

1340
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:29,170
It's still winnable.

1341
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:29,970
Reportedly.

1342
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:31,310
He's pulling off a God TP.

1343
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:31,610
Hang on.

1344
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,010
I see it happening in real time.

1345
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:35,810
I don't know what I was waiting for.

1346
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,270
I'll be on it.

1347
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:37,890
Yeah, I was going to say.

1348
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:39,830
It's not getting more crafty than you think it was.

1349
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:42,450
It's okay.

1350
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,350

01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:38,390
Oh, this is not looking good.

01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:39,850
That's not, that's a little awkward.

Yeah, to be fair, they're counting.

1848
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,360
It's when the other team does it.

1849
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,220
That's what it matters.

1850
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:06,400
That was okay.

1851
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,540

Dude, stop doing that.

1876
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:04,980
Because if we lose on Tim's map, then Tim might have to go
to AIM Labs.

1877
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:06,480
No, no, no.

1878
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:07,340

Guru said go to the pal.

1891
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,240
No, he said go to the pal.

1892
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,280
I don't know why you're doing this.

1893
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,600
There is fine proof.

1894
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,540
I'm down to play the old map.

1895
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,700
It's not a big team.

1896
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:39,060
This is weird.

1897
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:40,920
Wait, why are we playing this map again?

1898
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:42,140
Are we rematching?

1899
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:45,420
I guess so.

1900
01:43:45,740 --> 01:43:46,040
Yeah.

1901
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:51,200

It's literally just a strange job, Tim I'm popping off.

2042

Well, you're popping off, Tim.

2043
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:00,940
This character is so crazy.

2044
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:02,140
I might move.

2045
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:04,460
Or, uh, whatever.

2046
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:05,840
Wait, who?

2047
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:06,640
It died in something.

2048
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,540
I think they realized they can burn it now.

2049
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:12,460
Well, this.

2050
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:13,960

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2054
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:18,580
I pulled him back too.

2055
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:19,080
I pulled him back.

2056
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:21,760
Bye, Puffer.

2057
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:25,540
But I would live.

2058
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:33,520
I count me and Puffer had literally the same idea on that
portal.

2059
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:34,780
Around that corner.

2060
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:38,860
I think he executed it better.

2061
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:42,900
They're going to have Stormball, by the way.

2062
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:44,280

01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:39,580
They're definitely going to storm on this.

2098
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:45,010
Nice.

2099
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:45,830
Storm's dead.

01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:49,270
Easy.

2101
01:53:50,130 --> 01:53:51,190

Let's go, team.

2106
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:03,810
Good job, Tim.

01:54:07,030 --> 01:54:08,450
That's what we do.

2110
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:10,470
Oh, thank you for the raid, heavily.

2111
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:12,130
Zio's so locked in.

2112
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:13,590
Responsed right now.

2113
01:54:13,690 --> 01:54:14,810
Thank you for the raid.

2114
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:17,030
I know there was another raid earlier.

2115
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:19,010
Dear, thank you also for a raid.

2116
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:20,790
Zio's super locked in on them.

2117
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,210
The fights were intense.

2118
01:54:22,530 --> 01:54:22,990
Her kit is insane.

2119
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:25,410
Like, her all is really cool, but her kit is cracked.

2120
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:28,930
I just feel like she does so much damage.

2121
01:54:29,130 --> 01:54:29,850
Like, I said that.

2122
01:54:29,850 --> 01:54:30,770
She does a lot of damage.

2123
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:32,230
Okay, bro.

2124
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:37,910
She could technically, if you do get the combos, right, you
can, like, two to three shot, like, any non-tank.

2125
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:45,740
All right, what combo are we playing now?

2126
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,120
Oh, my God.

2127
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:48,540
You have the same idea as me.

2128
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,040
I just got the skin, too.

2129
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:51,780
Are you wearing the skin?

2130
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,220
I am wearing the skin.

2131
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:53,760
Hulk one.

2132
01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:54,740
Do you want to Hulk her thing?

2133
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:55,340
You can have it.

2134
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,420
I'm more of a thing guy.

2135
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:56,840
No, no, no.

2136
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:57,220
You have it.

2137
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:57,480
You can have it.

2138
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:58,700
No, I already played it.

2139
01:54:58,840 --> 01:54:59,360
I already played it.

2140
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:00,860
Oh, really?

2141
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:01,320

2142
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,180
I'll try.

2143
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:03,520
How does Storm feel?

2144
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:05,540
Does she feel?

2145
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:13,740
she's pretty strong she's pretty strong insane i never
thought she was a bad character but like she's even better

2146
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:20,320
now in my opinion i just feel like she can get shot down
quickly though wasn't that the issue sorry what's up like

2147
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:26,400
she can get shot down pretty easily by all the other hit
scan players yeah i think she might still have that but you

2148
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:34,600
do get a little bit of shields when you're on yeah mode you
look so cute in your little ducky outfit oh thank you thank

Wait, he has a heel.

2243
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:56,020
He has two heels.

2244
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:58,420
Why are they so strong?

2245
01:58:58,980 --> 01:58:58,980
No.

2246
01:58:59,340 --> 01:58:59,440
I die.

2247
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:00,060
I die.

2248
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,560
Oh, wait, I think it's because I was shooting.

2249
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:04,700
It's okay.

2250
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:05,180
It's okay.

2251
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:06,580
I'm stupid.

No, you're not stupid.

2253
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:09,620
You're my little angel.

01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:12,960
Yo, Chad, tell Bougar.

Okay, I have it again and I'm ready.

01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:25,780
No, isn't that Jeff first?

2264
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:26,460

2265
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:27,160
No, no, no.

2266
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:27,700

02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:46,880
You guys only have solo heals, Jeff.

2419
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:49,600
Okay, okay.

2420
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:51,020
That's all we need.

2421
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:51,980
Not just any solo heals.

2422
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:53,500
Okay, I'm getting grabbed.

2423
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:54,260
Thank you so much.

2424
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:55,020
Oh, wow.

2425
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:55,460
Wow.

2426
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,660
Thank you so much.

2427
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:57,580
Oh, my God.

2428
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,160
I got...

2429
02:04:58,160 --> 02:04:59,880
Oh, oh, it's okay.

2430
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:00,240
It's okay.

2431
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:02,920
It's time to pull out.

2432
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:04,960
Wait, out of behind.

2433
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:05,460
Out of behind.

2434
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:08,060
Wait, did they buff Ultron?

2435
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,360
Did they do anything on Ultron?

2436
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:11,440
No.

2437
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:12,500
Uh, a little bit.

2438
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:13,000
A little bit.

2439
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:13,920
What did they do on Ultron?

2440
02:05:14,260 --> 02:05:16,360
I think they just took range on the pads.

2441
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:17,000
Yes.

2442
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:18,000
Oh, yeah.

2443
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:19,100
Five more meters on your arm.

2444
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:19,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2445
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:20,860
That's what he needed.

2446
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:25,960
That's definitely what he needed.

2447
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:27,580
I'm glad someone agrees.

2448
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:28,180
Yeah.

2449
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,040
The longer beam.

2450
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:31,640
See you guys.

2451
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,480
I'm going to go over here.

2452
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:33,560
I'm actually going this way now.

2453
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:35,800
Oh, that is...

2454
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:37,180
Hey, guys, I just spawned in.

2455
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:40,060
I'm going to leave now.

2456
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,120
No one's getting credit for that kill.

2457
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:43,440
Don't worry, Moxie.

2458
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:45,880
I got you.

2459
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:48,360
Oh, my God, you actually can't break it.

2460
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:52,560
All right, your thing is gone, Moxie, so good luck.

2461
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:54,620
Oh, shit.

2462
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:57,200
Thank you.

2463
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:03,040
Mox?

2464
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:04,060
Yep.

2465
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:05,140
You okay?

2466
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:06,640
Help.

2467
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:12,000
I'm the one that needs help.

2468
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:13,680
Where's her?

2469
02:06:14,620 --> 02:06:15,100
Oh, shit.

2470
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:15,740
Oh, I got you.

2471
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:16,080
I got you.

2472
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:16,360
I'm healing.

2473
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:17,160
No.

02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:18,020
Oh, I tried.

2475
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:19,280
He ulted me.

2476
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:19,860
It's okay.

2477
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:20,560
An ult for an ult.

2478
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:21,440
An ult for an ult.

2479
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:21,900
Oh, no.

2480
02:06:24,020 --> 02:06:24,660
Oh, no.

2557
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:57,480
Going in the air, going in the air.

02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:10,060
It's him.

2567
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,200
I think they also have res, right?

2568
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:13,400
Yeah, I think so.

2569
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:14,520
Oh my God, he's mad.

2570
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:15,540
He's so mad.

2571
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:16,040
Oh, there you go.

2572
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:16,420
There you go.

2573
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:19,340
Oh, crud.

2575
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,880
I'm pretty sure they have...

2576
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:26,340
Oh, never mind.

2577
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:26,940
You got him.

2578
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:27,600
Oh my God.

2579
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:27,900

2580
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:28,160
How many?

2581
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:28,480
How many?

2582
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:29,320
How many?

2583
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:30,500
It's okay.

2584
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:34,660
They definitely have...

2585
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:37,720
Oh, they definitely played up.

2586
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:38,660
They're it, they're it.

2645
02:14:07,210 --> 02:14:15,790
couple of i want to today's going to be a little variety day
a variety shooters day uh but yes more dokey more dokey do

2646
02:14:15,790 --> 02:14:23,750
not worry that's fun though trying out all the different
stuff um elsa seems very strong her alt when you figure it

2647
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:28,770
out i feel like for all you just gotta like surprise people
with the alt because if you give too much distance when

2648
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:36,390
you're alting like it's easier to destroy like i almost
destroyed the Jeff alone, but like, I'm not strong enough.

2649
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:42,350
Like, I feel like if it was I was a DPS, I could shoot him,
shoot the ult, but like, I don't know if you guys saw it,

2650
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:48,050
but I almost killed I almost killed the Jeff ult, like, just
from my left click.

2651
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:53,550
I think like, if like, obviously if I was DPS, it was like
if I could have definitely destroyed it.

2652
02:14:54,490 --> 02:15:01,770
But like, I think like it's easier if you're surprising
people, but her damage alone is crazy, I feel.

2653
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:05,250
I think her damage alone without the is already really
strong.

2654
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:07,210
I am so sad.

2655
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:11,490
They got rid of the colored night mode.

2656
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:12,810
I'm so sad.

2657
02:15:12,950 --> 02:15:15,910
I want my dark blue midnight sky back.

2658
02:15:16,610 --> 02:15:19,990
Oh, it's just too depressing when it's just pitch black.

2659
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:30,150
And makes me feel like a real D-Gen when I'm on Twitter in
my bed.

2660
02:15:32,710 --> 02:15:38,610
when I'm on Twitter, At 4 in the morning, it's like, I feel
like a real degenerate.

2661
02:15:39,670 --> 02:15:45,170
Yeah, but then when it was dark blue, I felt less sad about
myself.

2662
02:15:50,570 --> 02:15:53,230
I felt less sad.

2663
02:15:57,540 --> 02:16:01,380
Yeah, but then, like, I could cope when it's midnight blue.

2664
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:04,640
When it's midnight blue, I could cope.

2665
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:18,200
yeah we had a lot of funny moments today um very uh fun

Like, you have to complete challenges to earn points to
receive to get the skin.

I can watch a trailer.

2740
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:35,500

2757
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:49,590
Okay, that should be fine.

2758
02:25:50,510 --> 02:25:50,830
Nice.

2759
02:25:56,090 --> 02:25:57,410
I'm just gonna let them...

2760
02:25:57,410 --> 02:25:58,610
Yeah, I was gonna stagger this.

2761
02:25:59,090 --> 02:25:59,450
Alright, nice.

2762
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:00,090
Dive gone.

2763
02:26:00,250 --> 02:26:01,250
Dive gone, chat.

2764
02:26:02,070 --> 02:26:02,710
Dive gone.

2765
02:26:04,710 --> 02:26:06,970
No longer have to worry about it.

2766
02:26:07,010 --> 02:26:07,450
It's okay.

2767
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:09,940
They have egotistical DPS.

2768
02:26:10,430 --> 02:26:12,110
That's definitely not gonna swap off.

2769
02:26:12,590 --> 02:26:14,130
Swap off to play triple support.

2770
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:15,650
There's no way.

2771
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:24,460
It's okay.

2772
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:25,400
There we go.

2773
02:26:29,420 --> 02:26:31,620
Maybe which one are we going to use first?

2774
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:34,720
Oh, that first.

2775
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:38,040
Oh, nice.

2776
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:40,060
Don't worry.

2777
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:41,400
Oh.

2778
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:46,980
It's okay.

2779
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:49,140
They technically have two support ups.

2780
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:53,860
So in the end, it's like, you know, we just got the same.

2781
02:26:53,880 --> 02:27:05,700
amount of us you know if you think about it they use two
support us so and we used two support us so it's like very

2782
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:25,160
similar it's the maps add up think about it the map adds up
okay we have to kill oh my god why did you oh my god why did

2783
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:34,580
you us off why did it take us so long to kill oh

2784
02:27:39,220 --> 02:27:43,360
my god why did it take us so long oh my god they see nine

2785
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:54,540
the math added up guys they had two support ults they used
their two support ults and we used two of our support ults

2786
02:27:54,540 --> 02:28:00,060
too i don't know how she see nine that was crazy i like it

2787
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:21,320
all right i'll i'll do i'll be last okay me last okay i look
at that communication is key see look at that i am

2788
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:31,980
communicating just feels like easier game yes because i'm
playing in gm celestial 3 it should better be easy i

2789
02:28:31,980 --> 02:28:35,160
literally was in the lobby with one above all, like

2790
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:40,380
this better be easy.

2791
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,020
These players do not aim like the other players.

2792
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:50,940
I'll do that now, just in case, because they're fucking
fast.

2793
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:54,340
Alright.

2794
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:56,380
There you go.

2795
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:57,980
If they...

2796
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:00,420
Yeah.

2797
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:01,820
They have all...

2798
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:03,020
So, ooh, that's unlucky.

2799
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:04,420
Oh.

2800
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:06,260
Yep.

2801
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:08,840
I mean, it's just on...

2802
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:09,340
Oh, okay.

2803
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:12,540
I was hoping that's fine.

2804
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:15,780
That's okay.

2805
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:22,910
We can kill her, right?

2806
02:29:23,190 --> 02:29:24,110
Like, technically?

2807
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:25,650
Like, in theory?

2808
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:28,390
Holy shit.

2809
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:29,330
Okay, the double.

2810
02:29:32,730 --> 02:29:33,770
Oh, shit.

2811
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:35,630
Okay, that's...

2812
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:37,750
I have already, so...

2813
02:29:39,710 --> 02:29:41,970
Yeah, I didn't think like double...

2814
02:29:41,970 --> 02:29:46,570
I don't know, the double melee does not do much against one
cloak.

2815
02:29:46,970 --> 02:29:49,430
I don't know.

2816
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:55,750
I felt like the double cloak just you know, double melee
against one little woman.

2817
02:29:58,330 --> 02:30:00,750
Didn't seem the smartest.

2818
02:30:05,410 --> 02:30:06,010
Oh my god.

2819
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:07,950
I just got more dangerous.

2820
02:30:08,270 --> 02:30:30,180
said me last so all right me last all right me last and then
i don't think i have to use this honestly it would be crazy

2821
02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:34,240
if i had to use another support up like this is so winnable

2822
02:30:38,370 --> 02:30:42,390
maybe not okay yeah i didn't have to use it

2823
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:47,920
Bro, that rogue...

2824
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:49,800
Wait, living way too long.

2825
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:51,520
See, look at that.

2826
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:52,360
Restraint!

2827
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:53,000
Guys!

2828
02:30:54,580 --> 02:30:56,660
I practiced restraint!

2829
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:01,600
Oh my god, alright.

2830
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:03,220
Hope I got him.

2831
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,100
Look at that.

2832
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:10,720
Look at that restraint over there!

2833
02:31:14,410 --> 02:31:15,670
Look at that!

2834
02:31:15,850 --> 02:31:16,730
Oh shit!

2835
02:31:20,270 --> 02:31:30,190
it's all right there is a panther behind us but it's okay i
did not know how i got that that seems so far away from us

2836
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:46,410
that makes that's what makes me different from me and the
other players i think we can you know what there we go all

2837
02:31:46,410 --> 02:31:48,450
right and then i'll fucking leave i guess

2838
02:31:53,330 --> 02:31:54,490
Oh, fuck.

2839
02:31:54,770 --> 02:31:55,650
What the fuck?

2840
02:31:59,530 --> 02:32:01,630
I did not expect all that.

2841
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:05,780
Oh, my God.

2842
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:06,260

Oh, my God.

2844
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:10,160

2846
02:32:16,060 --> 02:32:16,600

It was some Canadian holiday that I'm not aware of.

2917
02:38:40,480 --> 02:38:45,120
Like, uh, because like we have some weird ass Canadian
holidays that are considered federal holidays.

2918
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:51,240
And then, and then like I actually showed up, like I showed
up at class and I, like, I was just like, where is

2919
02:38:51,240 --> 02:38:51,660
everybody?

2920
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:58,280
And then the professor came to class after like 15 minutes
and she was like, what are you doing here?

2921
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:01,280
I don't remember what holiday it was.

2922
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:10,880
me and another student and there she's like what are you
doing here did you not read the syllabus and it's like she

2923
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:20,600
pulled the did you not read the syllabus i was like no now
she does i don't read the syllabus because in university

2924
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:27,060
they were every the first class there's a syllabus that
tells you what every day is gonna be that's what the

2925
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:33,220
syllabus does and it tells you if there's class on that day
or like what they're gonna be learning on specific like

2926
02:39:33,220 --> 02:39:47,220
weeks and stuff and she got me she caught me i didn't know i
read the syllabus during finals because like i'm like why do

2927
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:51,980
i need to read the syllabus where i can just show up in
class you know because i don't i i always try to show up in

2928
02:39:51,980 --> 02:39:56,920
class i don't wait for the powerpoints because the
professors always add additional information i have a

2929
02:39:56,920 --> 02:40:01,940
professor that'll do these quizzes um that were like 25% of
your grade for each quiz.

2930
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:08,680
And, and like, she would like, she would, like, add
additional information that you can only get in lectures

2931
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:15,940
that are not in the, like, in her specific lectures that are
not in any of the reading, like, in the reading materials or

2932
02:40:15,940 --> 02:40:17,860
in the PowerPoints that she uploads.

2933
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:24,600
And so, like, I have to go to every class because some of
the questions will come from lectures themselves where,

2934
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:28,040
like, you can't, you won't know the answer unless you come
to the lecture.

2935
02:40:28,040 --> 02:40:37,580
like so like it became a habit of mine to always show up to
i like i try my best to show up to lectures and like and i

2936
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:43,400
felt like i didn't have to read the syllabus because like i
if i show up for class it's just gonna i'm gonna learn it

2937
02:40:43,400 --> 02:40:53,800
anyway like um star style they give a twitch brown thank you
there are but then what i thought it depends on the class

2938
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:59,260
themselves there was some classes I did like didn't attend
fully but there were like I some I try my best to attend all

2939
02:40:59,260 --> 02:41:05,260
the classes uh because I wanted I was like a very studious
person back then I don't know what I did I became a vtuber

2940
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:21,820
um um and then also um and then also like I remember like uh
I took a movie class before like I took like a uh movie film

2941
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:29,340
class where like it's all about like learn I don't even the
job what the exact theme like the theme of the class but all

2942
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:37,100
we do is just watch films and they'll give us quiz quizzes
about based off of the film and then um they're so specific

2943
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:44,660
i remember like the quizzes would be and it's like 10 this
is the worst it was like 10 questions if you get one like 10

2944
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:53,720
questions quiz is 25 of your grade if you get one question
wrong it's 90 percent If you get two questions wrong, you

2945
02:41:53,720 --> 02:42:01,420
get, it's like, you went from like 100% will be A plus, 90%
will be A, 80%, like, and then if you get two questions

2946
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:10,700
wrong, um, A minus or like B plus, and then like you have to
get like at least 90, nine of the 10 questions right to be

2947
02:42:10,700 --> 02:42:11,640
in a good grades.

2948
02:42:12,140 --> 02:42:12,880
It was crazy.

2949
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:17,260
It was intense.

2950
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:25,420
And then one of my friends made me take the class, made me
take the class with her because, um, She was like, oh, don't

2951
02:42:25,420 --> 02:42:25,780
worry.

2952
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:27,400
We're just going to be watching movies.

2953
02:42:29,080 --> 02:42:34,700
You know, because you need those classes to pad your
schedule for like EZA classes.

2954
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:36,660
Like, oh, this apparently is an EZA class.

2955
02:42:36,940 --> 02:42:38,020
You just got to watch films.

2956
02:42:38,180 --> 02:42:39,360
I was like, oh, that's cool.

2957
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:42,600
Sure.

2958
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:44,780
Why are we not bad at Gambit?

2959
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:50,440
I swear to God, if Gambit goes through, I swear, I'm not
playing Gambit.

2960
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:51,680
If Gambit goes through.

2961
02:42:54,830 --> 02:42:56,610
I swear to God.

2962
02:42:58,550 --> 02:42:59,510
I'm not playing Gambit.

2963
02:42:59,650 --> 02:43:02,650
That's on the DPS for not fucking playing Gambit.

2964
02:43:03,290 --> 02:43:04,390
Oh my God.

2965
02:43:08,370 --> 02:43:09,870
Someone play Gambit.

2966
02:43:09,990 --> 02:43:11,250
I'm not playing Gambit.

2967
02:43:12,270 --> 02:43:14,330
That's on the DPS as well.

2968
02:43:16,070 --> 02:43:18,550
Yeah, because they're planning Phoenix.

2969
02:43:18,690 --> 02:43:19,550
That's on them.

2970
02:43:24,540 --> 02:43:27,120
I refuse to play Gambit right now.

2971
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:42,220
and we got to run Gambit by the way why did it okay there we
put our cloak player on Gambit let's go like they must live

2972
02:43:42,220 --> 02:43:50,360
with their oh yeah the DPS player being like by the way
supports you gotta play Gambit now I'm like oh yeah you're

2973
02:43:50,360 --> 02:43:52,620
the ones that didn't ban Gambit

2974
02:44:00,660 --> 02:44:10,180

want to play in scam and then fucking ban gamut i hate that

2975
02:44:10,180 --> 02:44:15,460

the supports if they we have the reason why i don't play i

2976
02:44:15,460 --> 02:44:20,880
don't want to do it when they don't ban gambit is because
they're just gonna blame our gambit player if their other

2977
02:44:20,880 --> 02:44:27,460
gambit dips them but they were the ones then and then we're
like well why didn't you ban gambit i

2978
02:44:34,010 --> 02:44:38,350
feel like okay if they're running... Oh, no.

2979
02:44:41,310 --> 02:44:41,930

02:44:41,930 --> 02:44:42,270
Okay, wait.

2981
02:44:42,350 --> 02:44:44,230

They're not running mag, so I can actually...

I see a lot of rogue players.

2985
02:44:54,230 --> 02:44:56,570

Okay.

2988
02:45:00,950 --> 02:45:02,350
I feel like Cloak would be strong.

3000

They're like, oh, now we need triple.

3001
02:46:32,550 --> 02:46:34,250
I don't know if I can save him.

3002
02:46:34,290 --> 02:46:34,970
That's the thing.

3003
02:46:37,270 --> 02:46:39,690

What happened to the code?

3047
02:49:51,730 --> 02:49:54,390
The code has been broken.

3048
02:49:56,270 --> 02:49:57,330
Oh no.

3049
02:49:58,290 --> 02:49:59,230
Oh no.

02:50:00,410 --> 02:50:03,330
Oh why are you all running from my...

3051
02:50:05,370 --> 02:50:06,730
And if only you were in the...

3052
02:50:06,730 --> 02:50:07,350
You want to go in?

3053
02:50:07,430 --> 02:50:07,890
You want to go in?

3054
02:50:07,990 --> 02:50:08,550
You got...

3055
02:50:08,550 --> 02:50:10,310
Oh, I guess not.

3056
02:50:13,310 --> 02:50:17,490
If he actually healed me while we were doing this, it would
have been one of them.

3057
02:50:18,470 --> 02:50:19,930
It would have been like...

3058
02:50:19,930 --> 02:50:21,230
We could have capped that.

3059
02:50:23,590 --> 02:50:24,590
Oh, shit.

3060
02:50:26,490 --> 02:50:27,570
He's so dead.

3061
02:50:27,710 --> 02:50:29,150
I'm fucking leaving.

3062
02:50:30,830 --> 02:50:31,270
Like...

3063
02:50:31,730 --> 02:50:33,670
Holy shit, unless...

3064
02:50:33,670 --> 02:50:34,030
Alright.

3065
02:50:36,750 --> 02:50:39,710
Can we get the squirrel, Sam, please?

3066
02:50:41,990 --> 02:50:42,550
Geometry!

3067
02:50:44,050 --> 02:50:46,270
Simple geometry will save you!

3068
02:50:47,470 --> 02:50:49,310
I don't know if our daredevil is alive.

3069
02:50:51,650 --> 02:50:52,930
Okay, he has all for sure.

3070
02:50:53,090 --> 02:50:54,110
I'm fucking...

3071
02:50:55,630 --> 02:50:57,070
I'm worried about that.

3072
02:50:59,930 --> 02:51:01,430
Alright, two four fights.

3073
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:03,090
Oh, okay.

3074
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:07,750
Man,

3075
02:51:15,410 --> 02:51:17,810
this guy has a lot of suggestions right now.

3076
02:51:22,040 --> 02:51:22,820
Gambit never folds.

3077
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:24,700
Gambit never folds.

3078
02:51:27,860 --> 02:51:27,880
Gambit never folds.

3079
02:51:27,880 --> 02:51:30,960
Gambit never folds.

3080
02:51:34,940 --> 02:51:35,580
Holy!

3081
02:51:36,420 --> 02:51:37,300
What is that?

3082
02:51:37,320 --> 02:51:42,840

3084
02:52:11,670 --> 02:52:12,650
we can keep each other.

3085
02:52:14,010 --> 02:52:16,290
Okay, like, I don't know about that now.

3086
02:52:21,010 --> 02:52:24,030
I'm trying to keep each other alive right now.

3087
02:52:24,690 --> 02:52:25,410
Hello, Gambit.

3088
02:52:25,670 --> 02:52:25,910
Hello.

3089
02:52:27,910 --> 02:52:28,990
I live.

3090
02:52:31,570 --> 02:52:32,890
All right, all right, all right, all right.

3091
02:52:33,330 --> 02:52:37,690
The amount of stuff I'm doing for my Gambit.

3092
02:52:40,230 --> 02:52:42,770
Hello guys, um, point.

3093
02:52:51,190 --> 02:52:51,710
Point.

3094
02:52:52,790 --> 02:52:54,630
Maybe I should play Gambit.

3095
02:52:55,930 --> 02:52:58,130
Of course your story's in Worship.

3096
02:53:02,910 --> 02:53:05,870
I don't think our Gambit plays Gambit.

3097
02:53:06,750 --> 02:53:09,110
I think I'll play Gambit.

3098
02:53:09,590 --> 02:53:09,770
I don't think I'll play Gambit.

3099
02:53:11,010 --> 02:53:15,410
I have a feeling they don't play Gavit.

3100
02:53:16,070 --> 02:53:18,810
I don't want to play Gavit!

3101
02:53:24,150 --> 02:53:27,910
I don't want to play Gavit!

3102
02:53:28,970 --> 02:53:36,290
Oh my god.

3103
02:53:40,250 --> 02:53:48,150
It has too much with gambol just fucking rip it like the
hesitation is too much when they get it they hesitate they

3104
02:53:48,150 --> 02:53:54,350
like hold it for some fucking reason they hold it as a
counter on and i'm like bro just rip it you're supposed to

3105
02:53:54,350 --> 02:53:56,950
use it before they defensive i'll

3106
02:54:02,740 --> 02:54:15,220
all right here we go all right here we go we do this i just
didn't want to play gambit i wish we banned gambit

3107
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:20,880
We're in chat.

3108
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:21,640
Oh.

3109
02:54:22,280 --> 02:54:23,960
Well, it's still a critique.

3110
02:54:24,480 --> 02:54:26,910
There's too much hesitation for it.

3111
02:54:36,660 --> 02:54:37,840
Alright, there you go.

3112
02:54:41,970 --> 02:54:42,630
It's fine.

3113
02:54:43,950 --> 02:54:44,750
That's unlucky.

3114
02:54:47,370 --> 02:54:48,110
Oh my god.

3115
02:54:48,170 --> 02:54:48,830
I'm missing my...

3116
02:54:48,830 --> 02:54:50,290
I haven't done this in so long.

3117
02:54:50,930 --> 02:54:52,830
I am missing my cards, though.

3118
02:54:52,970 --> 02:54:53,690
Are you serious?

3119
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:57,850
Yeah, he's fucking dead.

3120
02:54:59,830 --> 02:55:00,790
He's fucking dead.

3121
02:55:05,620 --> 02:55:06,940
Yo, this door is fucking out.

3122
02:55:12,380 --> 02:55:12,780
Unlucky.

3123
02:55:18,550 --> 02:55:20,570
I don't think it's a Thor problem.

3124
02:55:20,750 --> 02:55:21,290
I think.

3125
02:55:21,630 --> 02:55:22,950
We don't even need to play Gabman.

3126
02:55:23,030 --> 02:55:24,550
They don't even have Gabman, to be fair.

3127
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:28,930
I didn't want to use that, but whatever.

3128
02:55:31,490 --> 02:55:32,770
Do we kill anything with it?

3129
02:55:34,270 --> 02:55:35,270
I'm going to rip at the moment.

3130
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:48,320
let's fucking go go in there we go is there anything else in
there we're five

hesitation you get it you use it you don't fucking you don't

3132
02:56:02,460 --> 02:56:13,060

advantage oh my god i fucking yeah i didn't see the rogue i

3133
02:56:13,060 --> 02:56:14,520

sorry when did i chase other women i've been so loyal

3141
02:57:30,210 --> 02:57:31,010
Does he have ult?

3142
02:57:31,230 --> 02:57:32,210
I don't remember if he used it.

3143
02:57:32,510 --> 02:57:33,710
What the fuck?

3144
02:57:34,170 --> 02:57:35,650
He got deleted so fast.

3145
02:57:37,570 --> 02:57:41,460
And I want to use heal cards, but what else can I do about
it?

3146
02:57:43,330 --> 02:57:45,750
We have... I want to use it, but...

3147
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:50,580
There you go.

3148
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:50,960
See?

3149
02:57:55,510 --> 02:57:56,130
There you go.

3150
02:57:57,790 --> 02:57:58,250
Alright.

3151
02:57:58,810 --> 02:58:01,210
I saw Daredevil ult, and I was like, it's time.

3152
02:58:01,370 --> 02:58:02,450
I feel like I'm being watched.

3153
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:07,760
Who is he fighting anyway?

3154
02:58:08,740 --> 02:58:10,140
He's trying to...

3155
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:12,260
Wait, is it the squirrel girl?

3156
02:58:13,200 --> 02:58:15,440
But she's still behind us!

3157
02:58:23,740 --> 02:58:25,820
Okay, I got it.

3158
02:58:26,980 --> 02:58:28,680
What about the squirrel girl, guys?

3159
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:29,920
Is she still there?

3160
02:58:31,820 --> 02:58:32,540
Like...

3161
02:58:34,320 --> 02:58:35,740
I can't tell!

3162
02:58:46,180 --> 02:58:47,480
Oh, that's unlucky.

3163
02:58:48,300 --> 02:58:48,840
That's fine.

3164
02:58:51,060 --> 02:58:52,560
I'm gonna stay in that corner.

3165
02:58:58,470 --> 02:58:59,450
I mean, that's five.

3166
02:59:00,350 --> 02:59:01,290
Oh, that's a lot.

3167
02:59:03,950 --> 02:59:06,390
That's a lot of stuff, guys.

3168
02:59:06,570 --> 02:59:08,350
I think we just die.

3169
02:59:10,210 --> 02:59:11,270
I'll grab old charge.

3170
02:59:11,810 --> 02:59:14,370
I was like, wow, that's a lot of us.

3171
02:59:15,410 --> 02:59:16,230
They all press.

3172
02:59:16,750 --> 02:59:17,750
They all press Q.

3173
02:59:18,050 --> 02:59:19,100
We just walk and then we win.

3174
02:59:22,470 --> 02:59:24,070
How many others were there?

3175
02:59:24,750 --> 02:59:25,350

Alright.

3183
03:00:12,330 --> 03:00:13,090
That's unlucky.

3184
03:00:13,550 --> 03:00:14,610
They used the...

3185
03:00:17,790 --> 03:00:18,650
That's unlucky.

3186
03:00:20,090 --> 03:00:21,610
I mean, I know all it's to...

3187
03:00:25,190 --> 03:00:26,150
I mean, we could kill this guy.

3188
03:00:26,230 --> 03:00:26,950
We didn't actually kill him.

3189
03:00:28,070 --> 03:00:28,650
No, never mind.

3190
03:00:28,810 --> 03:00:29,050
We cannot.

3191
03:00:29,490 --> 03:00:30,490
We cannot kill him.

3192
03:00:30,770 --> 03:00:31,770
We cannot kill him.

3193
03:00:33,110 --> 03:00:45,510
holy don't let him he just literally walked up okay maybe
our story is a problem too but we gave gambit

3194
03:00:51,060 --> 03:00:58,260

3195
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:17,180
oh bro can we not go through that fucking dead trap Can we
not go through this death trap?

3196
03:01:19,740 --> 03:01:22,160
We went through the death trap.

3197
03:01:22,580 --> 03:01:25,940
Sorry, I got...

3198
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:27,140
Alright, to be fair, I...

3199
03:01:27,140 --> 03:01:29,500
When he said that, I was not paying attention.

3200
03:01:30,360 --> 03:01:33,040
I will say when he said that, I was just like, that...

3201
03:01:33,720 --> 03:01:34,860
I was just like, lol.

3202
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:38,220
I could have...

3203
03:01:38,220 --> 03:01:39,760
I should have focused up.

3204
03:01:40,680 --> 03:01:42,040
Is he not wrong?

3205
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:45,280
I need all charge.

3206
03:01:45,440 --> 03:01:46,980
I hope she lets me build all charge here.

3207
03:01:47,560 --> 03:01:49,060
Like, we literally need a win with Milo.

3208
03:01:49,960 --> 03:01:51,820
So I need him to let me build all here.

3209
03:02:02,370 --> 03:02:02,850
Oh my god.

3210
03:02:03,110 --> 03:02:03,450
Literally just.

3211
03:02:03,970 --> 03:02:05,090
I literally just needed.

3212
03:02:05,650 --> 03:02:08,050
I just needed like a little bit more all charge.

3213
03:02:11,770 --> 03:02:12,370
Yeah, we love.

3214
03:02:12,630 --> 03:02:13,070
These.

3215
03:02:14,610 --> 03:02:16,170
This door is just firing this.

3216
03:02:20,610 --> 03:02:22,070
Sit Thor.

3217
03:02:22,530 --> 03:02:24,890
When is 1916?

3218
03:02:25,670 --> 03:02:27,070
Oh my god.

3219
03:02:29,810 --> 03:02:31,330
Holy shit.

3220
03:02:32,210 --> 03:02:33,070
No, that guy.

3221
03:02:33,590 --> 03:02:34,710
Yeah, that guy ain't it.

3222
03:02:36,970 --> 03:02:37,730
1916.

3223
03:02:39,570 --> 03:02:40,290
Oh, wow.

If only.

3226
03:02:44,570 --> 03:02:46,970
Thor was something.

3227
03:02:47,190 --> 03:02:47,930
Yeah, let me avoid that.

3228
03:02:47,950 --> 03:02:58,740
this guy bro he like fucking was 1v1ing some guy by himself
and didn't even kill him

3229
03:03:04,070 --> 03:03:11,390

3232
03:03:36,020 --> 03:03:37,920
But, and I'm tired.

3233
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:46,880
Oh, you're on 200 ping?

Say, you can say in the team chat.

3236
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:54,160
If I knew, I'd pick up Gambit.

3237
03:03:56,720 --> 03:03:58,560
Sometimes I don't catch chat messages.

3238
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:01,840
Also, 200 ping Gambit.

3239

03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:27,040
Yes!

3251
03:04:27,500 --> 03:04:27,500
Yes!

3252
03:04:30,400 --> 03:04:31,840
Yeah, I'm trying to check it out.

3253
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:34,320
I'm planning on checking out next week.

3254
03:04:34,580 --> 03:04:39,740
I'm not a tactical RPG person, so we'll see how it goes.

3255
03:04:44,600 --> 03:04:46,600
But like, everyone's saying it's like really fun.

3256
03:04:48,060 --> 03:04:49,300
So, I don't mind.

3257
03:04:49,360 --> 03:04:51,920
I really want to try it and just see how it is.

3258
03:05:02,250 --> 03:05:04,350
The music is banger.

3259
03:05:04,530 --> 03:05:05,390
I know it's roguelike.

3260
03:05:05,470 --> 03:05:06,930
I like roguelikes, too.

3261
03:05:08,410 --> 03:05:10,510
I heard it's a really, really long game.

3262
03:05:10,630 --> 03:05:13,350
And apparently the intro is like a Simpsons intro.

3263
03:05:13,510 --> 03:05:26,890
we're like uh it's a simpson intro so uh yeah maybe look
maybe i'll do cloak yeah i'm gonna say look look double

3265
03:05:39,730 --> 03:05:41,030
marvel rivals

3266
03:05:45,150 --> 03:05:48,130
two to three more names of rivals and we're swapping the
apex.

3267
03:05:48,770 --> 03:05:50,150
Look at my skin.

3268
03:05:53,170 --> 03:05:54,070
Oh my god, not this map.

3269
03:05:54,230 --> 03:05:56,770
I hate this map so much.

3270
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:07,220
Yeah, but never.

3271
03:06:07,480 --> 03:06:08,440
I'm just so tired.

3272
03:06:08,640 --> 03:06:09,380
It's like PTSD.

3273
03:06:10,160 --> 03:06:14,440
Every time I hear Gavin never fuzz, I get trauma.

3274
03:06:18,740 --> 03:06:20,680
Yes, I have official skin in the apex.

3275
03:06:20,860 --> 03:06:22,920
That's why I want to check it out on stream.

3276
03:06:24,100 --> 03:06:26,460
Manny, thank you for giving the tier one sub to Lama.

3277
03:06:27,180 --> 03:06:28,540

03:06:36,120 --> 03:06:36,360
Alright.

3281
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:38,240
She's dead.

3282
03:06:39,380 --> 03:06:41,880
Oh, I knew it.

3283
03:06:47,820 --> 03:06:47,960

3297
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:42,120
We did it.

3298
03:08:42,600 --> 03:08:43,500
Oh my god.

3299
03:08:43,780 --> 03:08:46,660
This, I think the two DPS are dueled together.

3300
03:08:47,080 --> 03:08:48,060
That's why they're running.

3301
03:08:48,680 --> 03:08:59,440
Who would fucking, why would you one trick magic and, and,
and then duel together to force us to run two melees?

3302
03:08:59,920 --> 03:09:01,660
That's so fucked up.

3303
03:09:02,020 --> 03:09:05,960
That, that is messed up.

3304
03:09:06,920 --> 03:09:10,020
So we have to play with two melee characters.

3305
03:09:10,120 --> 03:09:12,120
We have no choice.

3306
03:09:17,470 --> 03:09:19,310
That's actually crazy.

3307
03:09:19,850 --> 03:09:20,930
There's no choice.

3308
03:09:27,900 --> 03:09:29,260
I'm trying.

3309
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:34,480
Let them have fun.

3310
03:09:35,360 --> 03:09:37,780
We can't even do anything about it.

3311
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:41,100
The fact that...

3312
03:09:41,100 --> 03:09:42,940
Oh my god, I still can't believe it.

3313
03:09:45,420 --> 03:09:47,060
It's their date, dude.

3314
03:09:47,660 --> 03:09:49,220
Don't ruin it for them.

3315
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:52,780
Where's the cart?

3316
03:09:54,380 --> 03:09:55,660
I'm like, where is it?

3317
03:10:11,190 --> 03:10:12,710
Alright, I'm going to be here.

3318
03:10:16,110 --> 03:10:17,110
Alright, watch this.

3319
03:10:17,950 --> 03:10:18,590
Oh, not yet.

3320
03:10:18,670 --> 03:10:18,950
Not yet.

3321
03:10:19,070 --> 03:10:19,270
Not yet.

3322
03:10:19,350 --> 03:10:19,630
Not yet.

3323
03:10:20,110 --> 03:10:21,330
It's going to be here soon.

3324
03:10:22,350 --> 03:10:23,690
It's going to be right here.

3325
03:10:25,550 --> 03:10:26,530
I'm waiting for it.

3326
03:10:26,650 --> 03:10:27,350
I'm waiting for it.

3327
03:10:28,690 --> 03:10:29,750
I'm waiting for it.

3328
03:10:32,550 --> 03:10:33,430
Oh, not yet.

3329
03:10:33,530 --> 03:10:33,830
Not yet.

3330
03:10:34,010 --> 03:10:34,230
All right.

3331
03:10:35,390 --> 03:10:36,190
Very surprising.

3332
03:10:37,310 --> 03:10:38,070
It's not here yet.

3333
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:43,420
Oh, goodbye.

3334
03:10:46,720 --> 03:10:47,080
Oh, all right.

3335
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:47,400
That's good.

3336
03:10:47,420 --> 03:10:47,640
That's good.

3337
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:48,820
We have this for Legendary.

3338
03:10:50,440 --> 03:10:50,720
That's good.

3339
03:10:50,860 --> 03:10:51,140
That's good.

3340
03:10:51,820 --> 03:10:52,500
No Legendary.

3341
03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:54,400
Any moment now.

3342
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:06,640
It's gonna be right here But you shouldn't let me farm up
though

3343
03:11:10,620 --> 03:11:12,000
Stand in the buffer!

3344
03:11:13,300 --> 03:11:13,560
Don't worry

3345
03:11:24,820 --> 03:11:30,020
There you go, there you go, there you go, there you There it
is, there it is Aw man, he jumped down

3346
03:11:33,180 --> 03:11:36,040
There it is, there it is There it is, there it is We wait

3347
03:11:44,140 --> 03:11:44,760
There you go.

3348
03:11:44,900 --> 03:11:45,360
I saved us.

3349
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:46,500
I saved us.

3350
03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:47,840
Oh my god.

3351
03:11:48,640 --> 03:11:49,380
We're saved.

3352
03:11:51,480 --> 03:11:52,240
You're welcome.

3353
03:11:52,540 --> 03:11:52,980
I'm a hero.

3354
03:11:53,880 --> 03:11:55,020
I'm actually a hero.

3355
03:11:56,300 --> 03:11:58,960
Well, I can still... I'm still a hero.

3356
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:02,280
Oh, don't you can't see me?

3357
03:12:03,020 --> 03:12:03,680
Still a hero?

3358
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:04,680
Still a hero, technically?

3359
03:12:05,620 --> 03:12:06,300
Still a hero?

3360
03:12:07,280 --> 03:12:09,500
He's dead, but like, I did my job.

3361
03:12:15,680 --> 03:12:16,740
Oh, they're teleporting.

3362
03:12:16,940 --> 03:12:17,140
No.

3363
03:12:20,720 --> 03:12:22,160
Oh, that's not good.

3364
03:12:23,120 --> 03:12:24,360
Where's my team?

3365
03:12:27,800 --> 03:12:28,940
It's not good.

3366
03:12:29,620 --> 03:12:30,300
It's right here, right here.

3367
03:12:30,940 --> 03:12:31,560
I'm right here.

3368
03:12:31,700 --> 03:12:32,160
I'm right here.

3369
03:12:32,300 --> 03:12:33,060
Whenever you're ready.

3370
03:12:34,080 --> 03:12:34,940
Whenever you're ready.

3371
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:41,560
All right.

3372
03:12:45,440 --> 03:12:45,920
Nice.

3373
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:54,620
Oh, shit.

3374
03:12:54,720 --> 03:12:55,380
Oh, shit.

3375
03:12:56,760 --> 03:12:57,680
Oh, no.

3376
03:12:58,260 --> 03:12:58,480
It's okay.

3377
03:12:58,500 --> 03:12:59,280
We have portal.

03:13:38,870 --> 03:13:40,510
That cloak saved our lives!

3382
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:45,920
Look at that!

3383
03:13:46,600 --> 03:13:51,100
My cloak fades, saves, and saves the game.

3384
03:13:54,580 --> 03:13:55,880
Look at that.

3385
03:13:57,580 --> 03:13:58,660
Actual hero.

3386
03:13:59,940 --> 03:14:01,140
He got the...

3387
03:14:01,860 --> 03:14:05,040
It's because like, I faded the... I faded the ult too.

3388
03:14:05,620 --> 03:14:06,620
So we're able to do it.

3389
03:14:06,820 --> 03:14:07,300
Good shit.

3390
03:14:07,400 --> 03:14:08,140
Good job, Doki.

3391
03:14:09,300 --> 03:14:10,360
Good job.

3392
03:14:10,960 --> 03:14:12,400
I'm patting myself on the back.

3393
03:14:12,700 --> 03:14:13,440
Good job, Doki.

3394
03:14:14,860 --> 03:14:16,060
Excellent job.

3395
03:14:20,050 --> 03:14:20,830
Thank you, Doki.

3396
03:14:21,230 --> 03:14:21,390
Thank you.

3397
03:14:21,590 --> 03:14:21,910
I know.

3398
03:14:22,330 --> 03:14:23,410
I know, Doki.

3399
03:14:23,970 --> 03:14:24,430
I know.

3400
03:14:24,710 --> 03:14:26,390
You did so good, Doki.

3401
03:14:26,810 --> 03:14:27,370
Thank you, Doki.

3402
03:14:31,080 --> 03:14:31,390
Three

3403
03:14:39,760 --> 03:14:41,220
seconds before you attack.

3404
03:14:41,520 --> 03:14:42,020
Get ready.

3405
03:14:42,260 --> 03:14:44,240
Why doesn't Cloak have any legs?

3406
03:14:45,080 --> 03:14:46,680
Oh, that's a good question.

3407
03:14:47,080 --> 03:14:48,720
I would say his figure skating.

3408
03:14:48,880 --> 03:14:50,800
emote is pretty silly.

3409
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:53,060
I don't think I saw.

3410
03:14:53,120 --> 03:14:53,660
I don't have it.

3411
03:14:53,660 --> 03:14:53,840
I don't know.

3412
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:54,760
I don't have it quit.

3413
03:14:54,920 --> 03:14:56,400
But he has a figure skating emote.

3414
03:14:56,880 --> 03:14:58,620
Because like a dagger has one.

3415
03:14:58,780 --> 03:15:00,160
And it's just he's just gliding.

3416
03:15:02,460 --> 03:15:04,660
Apparently in the comics he actually does have legs.

3417
03:15:14,390 --> 03:15:16,670
That's why like he lost them in the war.

3418
03:15:17,530 --> 03:15:18,670
Adam took the legs.

3419
03:15:18,850 --> 03:15:19,030
You know?

3420
03:15:20,310 --> 03:15:22,010
It's because Adam took it.

3421
03:15:23,870 --> 03:15:24,170
Okay.

3422
03:15:24,270 --> 03:15:31,690
I'm gonna And I can make sure he took the legs.

3423
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:36,220
There's someone behind us.

3424
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:37,720
Okay, I thought there was someone behind us.

3425
03:15:37,800 --> 03:15:38,940
I was getting scared.

3426
03:15:40,700 --> 03:15:42,580
Holy fuck, he got deleted.

3427
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:46,060
Oh my god.

3428
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:49,540
Bro, tanks are getting deleted so fast.

3429
03:15:49,660 --> 03:15:52,720
I don't think the Loki and I have stopped left clicking yet.

3430
03:15:54,020 --> 03:15:54,980
I'm pretty sure.

3431
03:15:55,660 --> 03:15:57,680
Oh my god, the one time I...

3432
03:15:57,920 --> 03:16:09,080
decided no he's fucking dead i mean you could copy me
whenever if you want to give never mind oh he fucked up he

3433
03:16:09,080 --> 03:16:10,580
messed up fight was lost

3434
03:16:13,620 --> 03:16:24,800
he wasted the up what the what i mean share okay what is our
hella doing

3435
03:16:27,920 --> 03:16:29,200
All right, I mean, that's fine.

3436
03:16:33,020 --> 03:16:35,800
Okay, he has to use it fast or, like, the alt's going to run
out soon.

3437
03:16:36,640 --> 03:16:38,000
Oh, they're using...

3438
03:16:42,360 --> 03:16:42,920
Don't worry.

3439
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:45,220
I got my own, too.

3440
03:16:48,360 --> 03:16:50,040
Oh, no, I wasn't in close for...

3441
03:16:50,040 --> 03:16:53,080
Oh, that's unlucky.

3442
03:16:57,160 --> 03:16:57,960
Oh, um...

3443
03:17:00,340 --> 03:17:04,260
I think the two melee thing is catching up on us now.

3444
03:17:04,520 --> 03:17:10,440
I think having two melee kickthroughs, it's not working no
more.

3445
03:17:15,670 --> 03:17:17,530
Oh, this is bad.

3446
03:17:25,120 --> 03:17:25,580
Oh, shit.

3447
03:17:25,700 --> 03:17:26,120
We stopped it.

3448
03:17:26,140 --> 03:17:26,800
We stopped it.

3449
03:17:30,380 --> 03:17:32,440
That's a lot of damage.

3450
03:17:34,480 --> 03:17:38,020
There's a lot of damage, guys.

3451
03:17:38,200 --> 03:17:39,880
I don't know.

3452
03:17:39,900 --> 03:17:42,860
if i can i'll i'll do this

3453
03:17:46,120 --> 03:17:48,920
what the he still pulls me where was it

3454
03:17:54,680 --> 03:18:08,060
um i know it's not there is something wrong okay there you
go okay all right one from one melee to the next but at

3455
03:18:08,060 --> 03:18:16,060
least the other melee is a tank you know it's the it's the
little things guys it's another melee but this time it's a

3456
03:18:16,060 --> 03:18:21,980
take melee which means more hp we need that we need that
guys

3457
03:18:25,180 --> 03:18:46,780
oh my god oh my god i'm not the i'm not the oh i'm not the

3458
03:18:46,780 --> 03:18:57,440
pushed it higher what i was behind the oh my god i was
behind the bus

3459
03:19:03,580 --> 03:19:19,100
i think guys i think the two melee might have might have
fucked us over i i think i think the two melee i mean

3460
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:27,860
looking at stats alone yeah no the other team really
deserved it more yeah i don't realize the thing all goes

3461
03:19:27,860 --> 03:19:40,880
under the buses maybe yeah looking at stats wise i think i
think maybe their dps was just a lot better just just a

3462
03:19:40,880 --> 03:19:50,540
maybe thank you and this thank you very much brad thank you

03:20:31,440 --> 03:20:35,440
has been like bad non-stop in rank because he's too strong

3468
03:20:38,800 --> 03:20:48,700
john halo is the strongest dps and jetpack cat is the
strongest support yeah he's been bad non-stop in rank guys

3469

I'm literally like almost one deer away from plat.

3505
03:24:28,550 --> 03:24:33,070
This rank, by the way, this rank is where some of the pred
players are at right now.

3506
03:24:33,470 --> 03:24:36,670
Gold and plat is where some of the pred players are at.

03:29:41,640 --> 03:29:43,340
Are they online?

3590
03:29:46,380 --> 03:29:46,820
No.

3591
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:47,800
Unfortunately, my...

3592
03:29:47,820 --> 03:29:58,720

3596
03:30:27,770 --> 03:30:30,670
The account is too weird.

3597
03:30:31,210 --> 03:30:32,890
It may have ended.

3598
03:30:33,190 --> 03:30:33,350
Okay.

3599
03:30:34,330 --> 03:30:35,370
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

3600
03:30:35,910 --> 03:30:37,810
Maybe I'll just play wild card.

3601
03:30:37,970 --> 03:30:41,690
It was not my go-to mode after yesterday.

3602
03:30:42,110 --> 03:30:44,990
But, like, maybe it'll be different this time.

3603
03:30:46,310 --> 03:30:49,590
I won't say it's my go-to game mode.

3604
03:30:49,730 --> 03:30:51,830
Because it's pretty fucked up.

3605
03:30:52,230 --> 03:30:54,810
But, like, maybe it'll be different.

3606
03:30:59,400 --> 03:31:00,080
Maybe.

03:31:05,160 --> 03:31:14,800

And it's like, that's where all the Pred players are lurking

minute clip of one game.

Under mode than rank.

3637
03:34:59,480 --> 03:35:00,120
Holy fuck.

3638
03:35:01,660 --> 03:35:02,020
Oh my god.

3639
03:35:02,180 --> 03:35:03,820
By reflex, I went bottom, right?

3640
03:35:05,220 --> 03:35:07,440
You ain't getting me over there.

3641
03:35:10,020 --> 03:35:10,160
Oh.

3642
03:35:11,760 --> 03:35:12,580
That's awkward.

3643
03:35:13,540 --> 03:35:14,500
I'll grab that, though.

3644
03:35:23,980 --> 03:35:24,460
Oh no.

3645
03:35:24,600 --> 03:35:25,020

You're not getting my body!

3647
03:35:26,700 --> 03:35:27,460
Get out of here!

3648
03:35:27,700 --> 03:35:29,020
I needed that self-risk.

3649
03:35:29,100 --> 03:35:29,880
I knew it.

3650
03:35:30,120 --> 03:35:31,180
I was just like...

3651
03:35:33,760 --> 03:35:36,560
Do I leave high ground?

3652
03:35:36,940 --> 03:35:38,100
Okay, this is less hell.

3653
03:35:38,420 --> 03:35:40,520
I just don't want to have a havoc right now.

3654
03:35:40,820 --> 03:35:41,600
Oh my god.

3655
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:43,280
It's okay he does it.

3656
03:35:53,370 --> 03:35:54,030
There you go.

3657
03:35:55,110 --> 03:35:55,430
Worth it.

3658
03:35:56,630 --> 03:35:57,910
Worth it.

3659
03:36:02,880 --> 03:36:04,160
Worth it.

3660
03:36:11,410 --> 03:36:13,210
Oh, you two again.

3661
03:36:14,870 --> 03:36:15,870
Two kills.

3662
03:36:16,470 --> 03:36:19,390
Guys, two whole kills.

3663
03:36:20,730 --> 03:36:22,950
It's so worth it.

3664
03:36:23,330 --> 03:36:24,410
Wait, I told you.

3665
03:36:24,730 --> 03:36:26,610
I told you I could get it.

3666
03:36:27,030 --> 03:36:28,410
Two whole kills.

3667
03:36:28,570 --> 03:36:29,970
I hate this place so much.

3668
03:36:30,510 --> 03:36:31,370
I fucking...

3669
03:36:31,370 --> 03:36:32,930
I hate this area.

3670
03:36:33,650 --> 03:36:35,910
Oh my god.

3671
03:36:36,110 --> 03:36:37,390
I'm going to my buddy here.

3672
03:36:38,170 --> 03:36:39,190
I'll fight with you.

3673
03:36:40,130 --> 03:36:40,630
Don't worry.

3674
03:36:44,310 --> 03:36:46,830
I shall no longer fight with you.

3675
03:36:47,170 --> 03:36:47,750
I...

3676
03:36:47,750 --> 03:36:51,910
I was like, don't worry, bro.

3677
03:36:52,070 --> 03:36:53,250
I'm here for you.

3678
03:36:56,130 --> 03:36:59,630
Alright, no longer shall I fight for you.

3679
03:37:01,230 --> 03:37:02,030
Where is...

3680
03:37:02,030 --> 03:37:03,430
Oh my god, what?

3681
03:37:04,350 --> 03:37:09,770
I don't fucking know.

3682
03:37:09,890 --> 03:37:11,070
Maybe it'll hit something.

3683
03:37:16,510 --> 03:37:17,110
Okay.

3684
03:37:18,230 --> 03:37:19,670
Is there anyone behind me?

3685
03:37:20,850 --> 03:37:22,030
paranoid right now.

3686
03:37:25,510 --> 03:37:26,610
Jesus Christ.

3687
03:37:28,210 --> 03:37:29,330
Instantly abandoned.

3688
03:37:31,270 --> 03:37:31,670
It's okay.

3689
03:37:31,990 --> 03:37:32,870
Everything is fine.

3690
03:37:37,100 --> 03:37:38,820
You think they're still fighting in there?

3691
03:37:44,640 --> 03:37:46,180
Are you fucking...

3692
03:37:46,180 --> 03:37:47,060
Who's shooting at me?

3693
03:37:47,340 --> 03:37:48,320
Who's shooting at me?

3694
03:37:48,740 --> 03:37:49,400
Who is it?

3695
03:37:50,660 --> 03:37:51,800
I still got it, though.

3696
03:37:51,820 --> 03:37:53,420
That movement was pretty clean.

3697
03:37:54,200 --> 03:37:54,820
Oh, no.

3698
03:37:54,980 --> 03:37:55,700
Oh, no.

3699
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:56,560
Anastasia.

3700
03:37:56,660 --> 03:38:02,340

3705
03:39:08,640 --> 03:39:22,220
wild card i'm i i'm not it's just i'm not a fan of landing
in that spot that spot fucking sucks like it actually sucks

3706
03:39:22,220 --> 03:39:32,280
so much wherever you look at go wherever you look at there's
nowhere to go i think this this character is really strong

3707
03:39:32,280 --> 03:39:48,660
in this game mode they took me to hell they they took me to
hell they're like welcome to hell Doki welcome

3708
03:39:53,540 --> 03:39:56,260
They're like welcome back Doki brain.

3709
03:39:56,720 --> 03:40:00,120
Why don't we land in your favorite spot?

3710
03:40:03,200 --> 03:40:05,320
Oh my god, you know, I trust my randoms.

3711
03:40:05,500 --> 03:40:14,220
Maybe this random won't land me to wherever the fuck that
was again I did not consent to be in that area

3712
03:40:17,840 --> 03:40:18,440
He's gone.

3713
03:40:18,460 --> 03:40:19,280
No, we're so far.

3714
03:40:19,620 --> 03:40:20,340
It's on the other side.

3715
03:40:20,400 --> 03:40:22,640
We're literally the other side of the map from that area.

3716
03:40:23,260 --> 03:40:26,780
That was the... That area is actually the fucking worst area
to ever land.

3717
03:40:27,520 --> 03:40:30,860
Like, the fact that, like, my teammate picked that, too.

3718
03:40:31,380 --> 03:40:32,520
It's literally the worst one.

3719
03:40:32,600 --> 03:40:37,660
Out of all the places they could land, that has to be the
worst spot of them all.

3720
03:40:42,180 --> 03:40:44,480
Out of every fucking spot that exists here.

3721
03:40:45,340 --> 03:40:46,640
Is there anyone even down there?

3722
03:40:49,480 --> 03:40:50,340
I don't think so.

3723
03:40:50,480 --> 03:40:51,460
I think there's a fight here.

3724
03:40:51,600 --> 03:40:53,040
I want to fight that though.

3725
03:40:55,700 --> 03:41:00,500
Okay I'm just gonna go there.

3726
03:41:01,640 --> 03:41:02,400
Oh my god, they're coming.

3727
03:41:03,180 --> 03:41:15,520
Oh my god All right, let the ambush begin guys Oh my god, I
hear them this time.

3728
03:41:15,800 --> 03:41:17,580
We will be the third party here

3729
03:41:24,200 --> 03:41:25,180
What the?

3730
03:41:25,520 --> 03:41:26,840
I was thirsting you.

3731
03:41:27,020 --> 03:41:28,940
I don't care if you weren't even part of this.

3732
03:41:33,080 --> 03:41:34,480
Wait, I hear it.

3733
03:41:37,020 --> 03:41:38,300
I don't care.

3734
03:41:40,920 --> 03:41:42,480
I hear another, Rez.

3735
03:41:44,220 --> 03:41:45,400
I hear you.

3736
03:41:46,380 --> 03:41:47,620
I hear you.

3737
03:41:48,160 --> 03:41:49,460
Oh, that's my teammate.

3738
03:41:51,440 --> 03:41:52,060
I'm sorry.

3739
03:41:52,320 --> 03:41:53,640
The trigger finger happened.

3740
03:41:56,520 --> 03:41:58,080
Oh my god, it's a cage.

3741
03:41:58,460 --> 03:41:59,800
Wait, they're back here.

3742
03:42:02,650 --> 03:42:04,530
Where they're behind us, aren't they?

3743
03:42:05,130 --> 03:42:07,250
Oh my god, they landed here instead.

3744
03:42:09,010 --> 03:42:11,970
Might become the thing you destroy.

3745
03:42:14,130 --> 03:42:14,690
Oh,

3746
03:42:18,990 --> 03:42:19,870
he queued.

3747
03:42:20,590 --> 03:42:21,850
That could have been our kill.

3748
03:42:23,210 --> 03:42:24,190
He's literally one.

3749
03:42:26,670 --> 03:42:27,450
What the fuck?

3750
03:42:30,660 --> 03:42:32,420
On the high ground?

3751
03:42:34,700 --> 03:42:35,940
There you go.

3752
03:42:36,420 --> 03:42:38,040
Ooh, you dirty dog dancer.

3753
03:42:43,780 --> 03:42:46,180
All right, is there any extra ammo?

3754
03:42:46,460 --> 03:42:48,700
I'm a little poor in ammo right now.

3755
03:42:50,420 --> 03:42:51,580
Where are...

3756
03:42:51,580 --> 03:42:51,960
Holy shit!

3757
03:42:52,220 --> 03:42:52,360
See?

3758
03:42:52,480 --> 03:42:55,280
Look how nicer this is.

3759
03:42:56,700 --> 03:43:00,640
Look how much calmer this is, guys.

3760
03:43:04,520 --> 03:43:05,080
Wow!

3761
03:43:06,500 --> 03:43:08,880

03:43:18,780 --> 03:43:19,680

3783
03:44:59,970 --> 03:45:04,070
What if, guys, they're gonna run out of ammo eventually,
too.

3784
03:45:04,710 --> 03:45:07,910

3796
03:46:56,470 --> 03:46:57,810

You shot our Valhalla.

03:49:47,870 --> 03:49:48,930
That's unfortunate.

3823
03:49:49,570 --> 03:49:51,670
Our Valhalla got shot.

3824
03:49:53,790 --> 03:49:56,830
Alright, so what's the plan?

03:49:58,370 --> 03:49:58,830

Hmm.

3827
03:50:01,710 --> 03:50:03,950

Holy shit, you're wild for that.

03:50:44,300 --> 03:50:45,500
I'm gonna check behind us.

3833
03:50:46,420 --> 03:50:49,780
In case anybody wants to do a little flankerunny behind us.

3834
03:50:50,220 --> 03:50:51,380
I'm very paranoid.

3835
03:50:58,810 --> 03:51:00,990
This guy is crazy if you're still peeking that.

3836
03:51:04,090 --> 03:51:05,030
No one flying?

3837
03:51:05,470 --> 03:51:06,290
No one flying?

3838
03:51:08,390 --> 03:51:09,890
That's good, no flyers?

3839
03:51:10,230 --> 03:51:11,010
No flyers?

3840
03:51:11,110 --> 03:51:11,370
All right.

3841
03:51:11,390 --> 03:51:12,150
No flyers.

3842
03:51:16,860 --> 03:51:18,220
What the fuck?

3843
03:51:19,680 --> 03:51:21,680
Oh, man.

3844
03:51:22,160 --> 03:51:23,400
I did not expect that.

3845
03:51:24,820 --> 03:51:26,180
It's like, where did he come from?

3846
03:51:31,430 --> 03:51:32,810
Wait, this zone is...

3847
03:51:34,910 --> 03:51:36,910
I want to make sure I don't waste my bullet.

3848
03:51:38,930 --> 03:51:41,430
I do wish I have a scout right now.

3849
03:51:42,210 --> 03:51:43,850
I feel like definitely be a lot helpful.

3850
03:51:46,230 --> 03:51:46,790
Okay.

3851
03:51:46,810 --> 03:51:49,190
If there's like one teeny scout.

3852
03:51:58,400 --> 03:51:59,420
Oh, you're so lucky.

3853
03:52:00,200 --> 03:52:01,620
We actually are so lucky.

3854
03:52:06,160 --> 03:52:06,440
Oh.

3855
03:52:06,480 --> 03:52:10,140
Did you hear that?

3856
03:52:16,680 --> 03:52:17,720
Oh, oh my god.

3857
03:52:17,840 --> 03:52:18,780
I almost fell down.

3858
03:52:19,220 --> 03:52:20,140
Oh, oh my god.

3859
03:52:20,300 --> 03:52:20,560
What's that?

3860
03:52:20,620 --> 03:52:21,420
Oh, we're next to zone.

3861
03:52:22,780 --> 03:52:23,980
We are next to zone.

3862
03:52:26,080 --> 03:52:27,120
Five squads.

3863
03:52:27,740 --> 03:52:28,580
Five squads.

3864
03:52:35,020 --> 03:52:35,640
I don't know.

3865
03:52:35,660 --> 03:52:36,640
I'm not shooting anymore.

3866
03:52:37,200 --> 03:52:38,920
I'm only 124 bullets.

3867
03:52:39,120 --> 03:52:39,620
I'll wait.

3868
03:52:40,480 --> 03:52:41,180
I'm patient.

3869
03:52:45,020 --> 03:52:45,900
I'm patient.

3870
03:52:47,140 --> 03:52:48,080
I can wait.

3871
03:52:49,160 --> 03:52:50,660
You mean it's like this in zone?

3872
03:52:52,200 --> 03:52:53,120
Yeah, this is in zone.

3873
03:52:53,680 --> 03:52:54,020
What the fuck?

3874
03:52:54,100 --> 03:52:55,040
Wait, this is in zone.

3875
03:53:02,490 --> 03:53:04,210
Whatever I take the wild card.

3876
03:53:04,310 --> 03:53:05,070
Do you think they'll know?

3877
03:53:10,640 --> 03:53:11,580
Oh, nice.

3878
03:53:13,780 --> 03:53:14,160
Nice.

3879
03:53:14,400 --> 03:53:15,720
Oh, I should have grabbed the third one.

3880
03:53:16,580 --> 03:53:17,820
It heals my teammates, too.

3881
03:53:17,900 --> 03:53:18,860
I got a little greedy.

3882
03:53:25,160 --> 03:53:26,180
I definitely got greedy.

3883
03:53:28,480 --> 03:53:28,880
Last squad.

03:53:47,120 --> 03:53:48,000
Is that crazy?

3888
03:53:48,520 --> 03:53:51,920

Oh, wait, never mind.

We're not cool.

3937
03:57:20,960 --> 03:57:22,720
We are no longer cool.

3938
03:57:27,720 --> 03:57:29,800

That was smart.

3951
03:59:49,790 --> 03:59:50,190
What's that?

3952
03:59:50,290 --> 03:59:52,910
That was a fucking smart-ass play I did there.

3953
03:59:53,650 --> 03:59:56,650
Through that nade, knew he had there's nowhere else to go.

3954
03:59:57,430 --> 03:59:58,450
Planked him from behind.

3955
03:59:58,910 --> 04:00:00,130
Didn't need an R9.

3956
04:00:00,230 --> 04:00:01,570
I should get my R9 right now.

3957
04:00:03,290 --> 04:00:06,630
Didn't even need an R9 for that shit.

3958
04:00:07,630 --> 04:00:08,190
That's it.

3959
04:00:08,210 --> 04:00:09,290
I'm going all in.

3960
04:00:09,790 --> 04:00:10,790
My 301.

3961
04:00:14,450 --> 04:00:14,930
Alright.

3962
04:00:16,110 --> 04:00:17,030
Is that it?

3963
04:00:20,520 --> 04:00:21,760
Still got it.

3964
04:00:23,020 --> 04:00:24,280
Still fucking got it.

3965
04:00:26,940 --> 04:00:27,280
Anyone?

3966
04:00:28,020 --> 04:00:29,340
Oh, they're all like over there.

3967
04:00:29,820 --> 04:00:30,700
We're sort of safe.

3968
04:00:32,640 --> 04:00:33,460
Yeah, head over.

3969
04:00:34,840 --> 04:00:35,500
Let's go.

3970
04:00:41,880 --> 04:00:43,740
Alright, let's fucking go.

3971
04:00:55,010 --> 04:00:55,850
Oh, yeah.

3972
04:00:55,930 --> 04:00:56,590
I told you.

3973
04:00:57,230 --> 04:00:58,970
Took me a while to get it back.

3974
04:00:59,130 --> 04:01:00,050
But I told you guys.

3975
04:01:01,910 --> 04:01:03,010
You know, best part?

3976
04:01:03,110 --> 04:01:04,790
Nobody's gonna respawn behind me.

3977
04:01:04,930 --> 04:01:06,190
That's the best part, too.

3978
04:01:13,310 --> 04:01:14,190
Alright, here we go.

3979
04:01:15,810 --> 04:01:17,450
I have no idea where the enemy team is.

3980
04:01:17,530 --> 04:01:19,850
I trust my bloodhound with my fucking life.

3981
04:01:21,210 --> 04:01:22,330
I'm not jumping that.

3982
04:01:23,410 --> 04:01:24,910
Yeah, they actually stay dead.

3983
04:01:25,130 --> 04:01:25,890
Isn't that crazy?

3984
04:01:29,770 --> 04:01:30,130
Hmm.

3985
04:01:32,130 --> 04:01:32,610
Fuck.

3986
04:01:33,190 --> 04:01:34,690
I'll take your light ammo, though.

3987
04:01:34,850 --> 04:01:36,610
If he doesn't take the flatline, I'll take it.

3988
04:01:39,410 --> 04:01:41,010
Yeah, takes it.

3989
04:01:42,090 --> 04:01:44,490
Alright, then I'll take this.

3990
04:01:45,390 --> 04:01:46,650
Oh yeah, too many shields.

3991
04:01:48,070 --> 04:01:49,270
Oh wait, I need that actually.

3992
04:01:50,810 --> 04:01:52,710
I forgot to enhance my light gun.

3993
04:01:53,390 --> 04:01:54,750
Almost forgot that was a feature.

3994
04:01:56,170 --> 04:01:57,030
Staying dead?

3995
04:01:57,130 --> 04:01:59,370
What a wild concept, I know, right?

3996
04:01:59,750 --> 04:02:00,690
That's crazy.

3997
04:02:01,590 --> 04:02:03,550
That I get to experience that.

3998
04:02:08,920 --> 04:02:10,380
Actually, I need a shield battery.

3999
04:02:10,460 --> 04:02:10,940
I have none.

4000
04:02:11,740 --> 04:02:12,820
Oh, they're fighting.

4001
04:02:13,140 --> 04:02:15,080
Oh, you know what that means.

4002
04:02:17,800 --> 04:02:17,920
Oh.

4003
04:02:33,320 --> 04:02:34,740
Is he gonna go through that?

4004
04:02:35,120 --> 04:02:36,420
That would be very surprised.

4005
04:02:44,100 --> 04:02:45,080
Well, I lift.

4006
04:02:45,280 --> 04:02:46,580
Oh my god, that's a window.

4007
04:02:56,860 --> 04:02:57,600
Oh, what?

4008
04:03:01,160 --> 04:03:02,080
Just in case.

4009
04:03:04,540 --> 04:03:05,500
Where did they go?

4010
04:03:09,330 --> 04:03:10,670
What the fuck?

4011
04:03:13,210 --> 04:03:14,390
Where did they go?

4012
04:03:15,150 --> 04:03:15,730
Excuse me?

4013
04:03:20,200 --> 04:03:21,500
That's another squad.

4014
04:03:23,580 --> 04:03:25,200
Oh my god, you're crazy for peeking that.

4015
04:03:25,300 --> 04:03:25,960
You are insane.

4016
04:03:27,260 --> 04:03:28,000
I have an upgrade.

4017
04:03:30,760 --> 04:03:33,100
I know I should- I don't like using F1.

4018
04:03:33,320 --> 04:03:34,320
It just takes two to die.

4019
04:03:35,040 --> 04:03:35,820
To F1 it.

4020
04:03:36,420 --> 04:03:37,480
That's why I don't use it.

4021
04:03:37,560 --> 04:03:38,080
I have a...

4022
04:03:38,080 --> 04:03:39,700
I just realized I have a naked R9.

4023
04:03:51,700 --> 04:03:52,400
Oh, fuck.

4024
04:03:53,980 --> 04:03:55,560
Oh, I messed up.

4025
04:03:57,040 --> 04:03:57,840
Oh, I didn't...

4026
04:03:57,840 --> 04:03:59,620
I didn't realize there were so many people there.

4027
04:04:00,260 --> 04:04:00,560
That's fine.

4028
04:04:00,680 --> 04:04:01,380
I can...

4029
04:04:01,380 --> 04:04:02,420
That's a third party.

4030
04:04:03,660 --> 04:04:04,020
Oh, my God.

4031
04:04:04,240 --> 04:04:04,740
Please, Bloodhound.

4032
04:04:04,900 --> 04:04:05,480
You gotta live.

4033
04:04:05,880 --> 04:04:06,860
For us, Bloodhound.

4034
04:04:07,660 --> 04:04:08,300
For us.

4035
04:04:08,940 --> 04:04:10,320
That was a third party.

4036
04:04:12,340 --> 04:04:12,620
Bloodhound.

4037
04:04:12,760 --> 04:04:13,500
You can't 1v1 this.

4038
04:04:13,700 --> 04:04:13,820
Bloodhound.

4039
04:04:13,960 --> 04:04:14,480
You gotta live.

4040
04:04:15,540 --> 04:04:15,940

the edge of it too That's actually really good Yeah That's

4052
04:06:38,320 --> 04:06:51,820
such a we're on the slow side so we're fine theoretically
we're fine i always believed guys i never doubted for a

4053
04:06:51,820 --> 04:07:12,470
second i have zero attachments that's right i never doubted

4054
04:07:12,470 --> 04:07:19,050
carbine i think i need it Never doubted my bloodhound for a
second.

4055
04:07:19,550 --> 04:07:21,830
I knew leaving me to die was the right move.

4056
04:07:28,100 --> 04:07:28,620
Alright.

4057
04:07:32,400 --> 04:07:32,860
Oh, man.

4058
04:07:32,940 --> 04:07:34,260
I don't think we're winning this stuff.

4059
04:07:35,960 --> 04:07:36,600
We're sort of like...

4060
04:07:36,600 --> 04:07:37,020
Oh, kidding.

4061
04:07:37,520 --> 04:07:38,280
We're sort of like...

4062
04:07:38,280 --> 04:07:39,120
We sort of have like...

4063
04:07:39,120 --> 04:07:40,620
Nothing right now.

4064
04:07:41,820 --> 04:07:42,540
Oh, it...

4065
04:07:42,540 --> 04:07:43,700
It did reset.

4066
04:07:47,180 --> 04:07:48,820
Oh, it did reset.

4067
04:07:49,900 --> 04:07:52,060
I have zero attachments, but...

4068
04:07:52,060 --> 04:07:54,040
But the bins reset itself.

4069
04:07:54,600 --> 04:07:55,280
So there's hope.

4070
04:07:58,880 --> 04:07:59,780
Replicator incoming.

4071
04:08:00,280 --> 04:08:01,680
Let's exercise our craft.

4072
04:08:03,420 --> 04:08:04,640
I just gotta figure out where they are.

4073
04:08:06,860 --> 04:08:07,640
I mean, yeah.

4074
04:08:07,740 --> 04:08:08,740
I think, yeah, you're right.

4075
04:08:16,000 --> 04:08:16,980
Here we go.

4076
04:08:20,160 --> 04:08:23,120
Let's hope they're not right behind us or anything.

4077
04:08:23,460 --> 04:08:24,880
That'd be so awkward.

4078
04:08:26,280 --> 04:08:26,620
Wait.

4079
04:08:27,500 --> 04:08:41,750
actually oh wait no because they won't see it you know fuck
okay wait no actually I thought they won't know because it's

4080
04:08:41,750 --> 04:08:54,830
invisible remember chat it'll be invisible so they won't see
it and then they'll come here and then they'll open this and

4081
04:08:54,830 --> 04:08:55,910
they'll get hit by the spike.

4082
04:09:00,000 --> 04:09:00,600
Should I need that?

4083
04:09:02,260 --> 04:09:03,060
I should need that.

4084
04:09:06,340 --> 04:09:08,960
I don't know what I picked up but I need that.

4085
04:09:11,040 --> 04:09:12,080
We can actually...

4086
04:09:13,040 --> 04:09:16,880
We don't want to guard the...

4087
04:09:16,880 --> 04:09:18,160
They haven't destroyed.

4088
04:09:21,080 --> 04:09:21,960
Infinite ammo.

4089
04:09:22,180 --> 04:09:22,920
I don't need it.

4090
04:09:24,860 --> 04:09:26,260
I don't know if I want the Kraber.

4091
04:09:28,260 --> 04:09:37,860
not if it's i don't know i don't know it's a little too
risky it's like craver it's a little too risky right now

4092
04:09:37,860 --> 04:09:48,220
infinite app yeah but like it's it's way too risky to do
this but the content don't keep i don't even know if these

4093
04:09:48,220 --> 04:09:58,380
are coming from here i swear to god they end up being in
front of us i swear to god is it worth it is it risk but the

4094
04:09:58,380 --> 04:10:07,460
clips you're right you're right he got it the bloodhound
took it wait but i could grab this though

4095
04:10:15,160 --> 04:10:18,240
infinite ammo oh my god we could do it

4096
04:10:33,390 --> 04:10:39,050
hey you're right Oh, you guys were right.

4097
04:10:41,730 --> 04:10:42,810
Hey, guys.

4098
04:10:42,890 --> 04:10:43,740
You guys might be right.

4099
04:11:19,320 --> 04:11:20,720
See, guys.

4100
04:11:21,880 --> 04:11:24,520
Who said I was washed?

4101
04:11:27,400 --> 04:11:30,180
Who said I was washed?

4102
04:11:34,760 --> 04:11:36,600
And he gave my touch.

4103
04:11:37,520 --> 04:11:39,560
Doesn't matter how long it's been.

4104
04:11:40,160 --> 04:11:41,920
Just, I don't know.

4105
04:11:42,120 --> 04:11:42,700
I'm so humble.

4106
04:11:42,820 --> 04:11:43,640
I'm just a natural.

4107
04:11:44,700 --> 04:11:46,840
Doesn't matter how long it's been.

4108
04:11:47,280 --> 04:11:48,920
It's like riding a bicycle.

4109
04:11:52,120 --> 04:11:54,280
Mr. McFluffy can't think of it.

4110
04:11:54,580 --> 04:11:56,300
Dear, it was so humble.

4111
04:11:58,640 --> 04:12:01,160
My Oshi is so humble.

4112
04:12:01,760 --> 04:12:02,420
Look at that.

4113
04:12:03,460 --> 04:12:04,640
Look at that.

4114
04:12:09,720 --> 04:12:20,420
easiest game of my life why past doki would have done it
you're right i would have finished the game in five minutes

4115
04:12:20,420 --> 04:12:30,600
you're so right you're so fucking right chat the past retro
doki could have completed that game in five minutes

4116
04:12:34,760 --> 04:12:36,340
my Watson skin, guys.

4117
04:12:36,500 --> 04:12:39,300
You can hit those headshots just like that.

4118
04:12:39,880 --> 04:12:40,420
See that?

4119
04:12:40,580 --> 04:12:41,560
Just like that.

4120
04:12:41,680 --> 04:12:44,040
You too can also hit those headshots.

4121
04:12:45,600 --> 04:12:47,260
Alright, got a top 10, play 5.

4122
04:12:47,320 --> 04:12:49,080
You know, I could grab like two more points here.

4123
04:12:49,320 --> 04:12:50,920
I did not raise anybody.

4124
04:12:51,240 --> 04:12:51,920
Fuck that.

4125
04:12:53,840 --> 04:12:54,920
Alright, let's see.

4126
04:12:56,320 --> 04:12:57,700
Is it the shoes?

4127
04:13:00,400 --> 04:13:00,880
Don't...

4128
04:13:00,880 --> 04:13:01,520
Alright.

4129
04:13:02,420 --> 04:13:02,980
By player.

4130
04:13:03,640 --> 04:13:04,160
Oh, I can do.

4131
04:13:04,160 --> 04:13:04,740
We'll get another top 10.

4132
04:13:04,760 --> 04:13:17,460
10 it should be easy okay i need to grab a pk next she hits
those i sure do that's me all right we'll do a wild card i

4133
04:13:17,460 --> 04:13:27,260
think it's the easiest to grab the pk what was it oh you
don't buy it's free it's actually free so all you have to do

4134
04:13:27,260 --> 04:13:36,660
is grind out your dailies here the dailies challenges these
points and anniversary legend challenges all of these and um

4135
04:13:36,660 --> 04:13:47,860
and then you can unlock it you basically unlock it in the
past i automatically get top 10 because wildcard only has 10

4136
04:13:47,860 --> 04:13:54,060
squads yeah and it's free too i

4137
04:13:58,600 --> 04:14:01,000
be like holy shit the double caustic

4138
04:14:05,220 --> 04:14:09,900
wait that's cheating it's not cheating we're trying to get
my skin.

4139
04:14:15,440 --> 04:14:16,640
Oh, get that, guys.

4140
04:14:18,140 --> 04:14:19,240

Come back, baby.

4142

What can I say?

4143
04:14:28,380 --> 04:14:30,980
I heard you guys were like, you should do it for content.

4144
04:14:31,160 --> 04:14:32,100
I was like, you're right.

4145
04:14:32,820 --> 04:14:34,620
Toki always does it for content.

4146
04:14:38,020 --> 04:14:41,420
She never backs down from content.

4147
04:14:52,410 --> 04:15:02,970

The teammates are coming over, guys.

04:18:32,330 --> 04:18:34,940

4184
04:18:39,480 --> 04:18:39,920
Okay.

4185
04:18:41,360 --> 04:18:42,500
Wait, did they leave?

04:18:42,620 --> 04:18:43,400
Oh, they left.

quarters but aren't none is aren't none okay i think the

4188
04:18:53,080 --> 04:19:05,480
double caustic is a little scary uh guys i understand now i
yeah no we literally gassed up the fucking house like that

4189
04:19:05,480 --> 04:19:14,520
that should break some code shouldn't it like didn't we
establish a geneva convention for something like this a real

4190
04:19:14,520 --> 04:19:18,460
thank you for this thank you for the twitch prize thank you

Oh my god, again?

4196
04:20:02,480 --> 04:20:05,440
I did not expect him to do a round two in there.

4197
04:20:05,800 --> 04:20:08,740
Okay, that's...

4198
04:20:10,110 --> 04:20:11,890
I didn't expect a round two.

4199
04:20:25,600 --> 04:20:27,080
Oh my god, same.

4200
04:20:46,320 --> 04:20:46,840
We didn't know.

4203
04:21:36,640 --> 04:21:39,260
Oh, wait, did he go that way and he died for it?

4204
04:21:41,040 --> 04:21:42,120
Alright, it's fine.

4205
04:21:43,700 --> 04:21:44,900
What was that?

4206
04:21:47,400 --> 04:21:48,280
Oh, here.

4207
04:21:50,280 --> 04:21:50,620
Wait.

4208
04:21:54,430 --> 04:21:55,330
Oh, no.

4209
04:21:59,670 --> 04:22:02,270
There, I gave them a little treat.

4210
04:22:03,990 --> 04:22:04,530
What the?

4211
04:22:07,980 --> 04:22:09,300
What the fuck?

4212
04:22:11,080 --> 04:22:13,020
I don't think his teammate got the menmo.

4213
04:22:15,320 --> 04:22:16,740
I don't know if you saw that.

4214
04:22:17,280 --> 04:22:20,140
But, like, did you see that?

4215
04:22:20,240 --> 04:22:22,100
His teammate was like, we're fighting them, right?

4216
04:22:22,500 --> 04:22:22,640
Like,

4217
04:22:31,730 --> 04:22:34,970
yeah, they definitely did not get the breathing in.

4218
04:22:41,490 --> 04:22:43,910
I don't really have long range, so I'll be here.

4219
04:22:49,440 --> 04:22:50,480
Alright, that's fine.

4220
04:22:52,880 --> 04:22:53,840
Don't worry, I'm mapping you up.

4221
04:22:56,340 --> 04:22:57,740
Where are we shooting at?

4222
04:22:58,020 --> 04:22:59,020
What the fuck?

4223
04:23:01,100 --> 04:23:02,940
I don't think I can hit that.

4224
04:23:04,880 --> 04:23:05,940
Unfortunately, I can't.

4225
04:23:11,280 --> 04:23:11,840
Wee.

4226
04:23:12,080 --> 04:23:13,080

Look at that.

4232
04:23:27,770 --> 04:23:29,070
Look at all that money.

4233
04:23:35,600 --> 04:23:36,160

Alright, now now I can do this.

04:24:35,350 --> 04:24:37,110
And where the fuck is the scope?

4242
04:24:37,270 --> 04:24:37,950
I guess not.

4243
04:24:45,210 --> 04:24:45,770
Oh shit.

4244
04:24:46,050 --> 04:24:47,810
Alright, let me grab this real quick.

4245
04:24:49,490 --> 04:24:51,610
Is there no one behind us just in case?

4246
04:24:59,660 --> 04:25:00,320
Take a deep breath!

4247
04:25:02,840 --> 04:25:03,740
Please, it's so long!

4248
04:25:03,800 --> 04:25:04,820
It's okay, I have another self-rest!

4249
04:25:07,420 --> 04:25:08,040
Nice!

4250
04:25:08,260 --> 04:25:09,480
No need to use stealth for us!

4251
04:25:11,580 --> 04:25:13,880
But we do have to go.

4252
04:25:16,220 --> 04:25:17,940
Wait, can we break these windows, chat?

4253
04:25:18,940 --> 04:25:20,600
Are these windows breakable, guys?

4254
04:25:38,320 --> 04:25:38,960
Okay, here.

4255
04:25:43,680 --> 04:25:44,300
Oh, no.

4256
04:25:52,270 --> 04:25:54,270
We're, like, slowly going up.

4257
04:25:56,270 --> 04:25:58,430
Okay, we have to leave, though.

4258
04:26:02,220 --> 04:26:02,920
Okay, that's good.

4259
04:26:03,040 --> 04:26:03,260
That's good.

4260
04:26:03,420 --> 04:26:03,980
That's not good.

4261
04:26:08,020 --> 04:26:08,720
Yeah, I had a feeling.

4262
04:26:09,560 --> 04:26:11,360
I was like, that does not feel like one team.

4263
04:26:18,460 --> 04:26:20,400
You think they'll let me...

4264
04:26:25,800 --> 04:26:26,180
Alright.

They did let me.

4270
04:26:43,360 --> 04:26:43,740

by the time you finish all your challenges, you should be

4308
04:31:20,050 --> 04:31:24,870
able to, you should be able to get a Doki Bird Watson skin.

4309
04:31:24,970 --> 04:31:26,110
Some people were asking why Watson.

4310
04:31:26,610 --> 04:31:34,470
It was the very first skin, it was the very first character
I got that led me to get my first Apex Predator slash Top

4311
04:31:34,470 --> 04:31:34,830
500.

4312
04:31:35,330 --> 04:31:37,470
So I was a Watson player of my squad.

4313
04:31:38,090 --> 04:31:39,310
At that time, Watson was meta.

4314
04:31:39,350 --> 04:31:42,250
You had to have Watson in your rank squad.

4315
04:31:42,710 --> 04:31:47,170
And that was my character that I had to play to get me Top
500.

4316
04:31:47,430 --> 04:31:53,590
And so, you know, she took me there and that's why I
figured, you know, I figured to, it's like, it symbolizes,

4317
04:31:53,590 --> 04:31:58,250
like, my journey in Apex on how I got my first top 500.

4318
04:31:58,970 --> 04:32:04,350
But yeah, like I said, just complete the challenges, and
then, bam, you get the skin.
