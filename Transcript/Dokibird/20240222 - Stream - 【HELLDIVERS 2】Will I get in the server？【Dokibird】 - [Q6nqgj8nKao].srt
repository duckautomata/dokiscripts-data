00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,780
Hello everybody!

2
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,380
I'm finally gonna get to try out Helldive!

3
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay, I'll say it before I start.

4
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,700
Fuck that one guy in my chat that was like, I'm gonna log into Helldive so Dokicat log in and get into a server.

5
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,260
Like, fuck you!

6
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,000
What is wrong with you?

7
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,100
Alright, so basically, I was like, I didn't realize...

8
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,700
Okay, so like, I've been in tutorial for like two hours now because I was scared.

9
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:36,440
And then I was like asking in chat, I was like, okay guys, cause like when I got in, it was like, oh server is at capacity, please try again later.

10
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,620
So like, you know, I've never played Helldivers before by the way.

11
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,980
I've never played Helldivers 1 and I've never fucking tried out Helldivers 2 because I was like, oh, I'm gonna try it out.

12
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,620
I was like, okay, if I'm gonna play Helldivers, I wanna play it on stream for the first time with you guys.

13
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,220
Cause like, I had friends being like, you guys wanna play Helldivers?

14
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,200
I was like, no!

15
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,620
I'm gonna do this for my dragoons.

16
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,020
But then everyone was like, good luck getting in.

17
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,380
I was like, what do you mean, good luck getting in?

18
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,980
So then, I was like, asking my chat, also, Mom, thank you for the...

19
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Machete Super, thank you, cheese.

20
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,680
Anyway, I apologize.

21
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,180
I'm a wizard.

22
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,500
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

23
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,940
Anyway, so I was like, asking in my chat, I was like, hey guys, so like, I'm in the tutorial.

24
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,460
Does this count?

25
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,600
And then, so like, obviously, the first two people were like, yeah, if you're in the tutorial right now, that means you're in the server.

26
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,800
So I was like, sweet!

27
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,300
And then right after that, one guy, I swear, if that one guy was correct, they're like, no, you're not in the server.

28
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,780
And I was like, oh.

29
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,140
So I was just like, oh, no, wait a minute.

30
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,760
And then, so then I was like, guys, please, I need to know.

31
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,080
Cause like, being in the tutorial doesn't mean being in the game.

32
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,880
Then, we are so fucked.

33
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,080
Cause like, I could just finish the tutorial right now, before the stream.

34
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,380
So then people, one person was like, no, you're okay.

35
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,540
You're in the game, you're in the server.

36
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,120
And I was like, nice.

37
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,340
And at the moment I wrote, nice, one other guy was like, no, you're not.

38
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,020
So I was just like, okay, well, we're gonna do it.

39
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,860
I swear to God, I feel like I'm gonna crash.

40
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,660
Cause like, people were like...

41
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,320
People were like, oh yeah, I mean, you could be in.

42
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,080
But like, that doesn't stop you from crashing.

43
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,880
And I was like, wait.

44
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,420
What do you mean?

45
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,140
It doesn't stop you from...

46
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, no!

47
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,940
Cause apparently when you crash, obviously you have to go back in there again.

48
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,660
So like, I'm just like, please.

49
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,800
Please, just at least let me finish the tutorial.

50
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,220
Also, Amelia, thank you for the Akasupa.

51
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,480
Thank you, thank you.

52
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,340
What do you call Helldiver squad?

53
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,860
Composed of Tyler Dragoons, Freebirds!

54
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,420
Thank you again.

55
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,920
Alright, so, yeah.

56
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,820
I just wanna do my part and squash some bugs for democracy.

57
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,640
So, let's get this started.

58
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,000
Where am I?

59
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,420
Alright, I've been like...

60
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,580
I don't even remember what happened.

61
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,940
Cause I've been like, looking at this.

62
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,380
Earn your cape.

63
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Check your map to...

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
Oh, I want a cape.

65
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,100
I wanna be cool.

66
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,420
Alright.

67
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,520
Time to find the one guy.

68
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,160
Alright, here we go.

69
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,780
I've never played Helldivers.

70
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,860
I'm actually going in blind.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,840
I heard it's really, really fun though with friends.

72
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,080
Alright, instructors, we'll see you on the other side.

73
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:52,980
Alright.

74
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,800
This is where all your tax dollars go to.

75
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,280
Honestly, I'm glad this is where all my tax dollars are going to.

76
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,660
Alright, nice.

77
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,400
The upcoming obstacles will take everything your exceptional physique can possibly take.

78
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,840
Let me see.

79
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,780
What about control?

80
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,120
Wait, what does control do then?

81
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,040
It's a real deal.

82
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,780
Get to it, soldier.

83
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,860
Alright.

84
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,320
I feel like I should have done this already before I got signed.

85
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,720
Like, before I'm in the field.

86
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,520
You know?

87
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,460
I feel like I showed the bugs why I was man who was made in God's image.

88
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,460
That was so fast and point.

89
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,780
Thank you for the super chat.

90
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,860
Thank you, thank you.

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,740
I'm a realistic battlefield simulator.

92
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,740
That's right.

93
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,360
Okay.

94
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,580
Oh!

95
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,110
Sorry.

96
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,390
I did it too soon.

97
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,650
Don't worry.

98
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,130
It'll be different.

99
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,810
Oh, fuck.

100
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,190
Okay.

101
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,830
It will not be different.

102
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,730
Okay.

103
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,550
Okay.

104
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,010
What do you mean?

105
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:07,570
Okay.

106
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,610
Alright.

107
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,650
I'll have to dive in.

108
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,910
Okay.

109
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,290
Then what?

110
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,550
After that, what happens?

111
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,170
What do I do after that?

112
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,610
Boom.

113
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,870
What do you mean?

114
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,910
Oh, my God.

115
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,910
Oh, my God.

116
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,130
Oh, my God.

117
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:19,530
Oh, my God.

118
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,350
I'm doing my part.

119
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,550
Well, I think of a magenta super thing.

120
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:24,810
Okay.

121
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,950
Alright.

122
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,390
Do I hold up?

123
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,790
What?

124
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,850
I can't hold on.

125
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,610
I can't get off.

126
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,390
Oh, don't hold shift.

127
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:36,890
Okay.

128
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,270
Okay.

129
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,850
Oh, my fucking God.

130
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,970
That's not me.

131
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,370
I swear.

132
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,530
Look at us.

133
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:49,830
I'm going to get up.

134
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,430
Oh, my.

135
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,910
Look at all these bodies.

136
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,770
That's definitely not me.

137
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,250
Thank you.

138
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,730
Thank you.

139
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,310
Thank you.

140
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,070
Thank you.

141
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,350
That's good.

142
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,090
That's good.

143
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,330
That won't happen to me in the real game.

144
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,530
E.

145
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:08,910
What?

146
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,450
How's the volume, by the way?

147
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,490
Grab a stim?

148
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,650
Where's the stim?

149
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,970
Oh, in front of me.

150
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,110
Okay.

151
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,430
V.

152
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,230
Alright.

153
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,650
Nice.

154
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,530
Yeah.

155
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,110
That wasn't me.

156
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,110
That was a different player.

157
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,400
You miss a bit load?

158
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:35,800
Okay.

159
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,560
Let me fix the volume real fast.

160
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,340
Boop.

161
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,700
I'll boost it up.

162
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,120
I don't know if sound guy's here today.

163
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,000
Let me...

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,260
Yeah.

165
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,120
Sound guy's not here.

166
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,860
I don't know actually if sound guy's here today.

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,060
Imagine that...

168
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,580
Oh, yes.

169
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,060
If you didn't fucking run.

170
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,860
Everybody runs.

171
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,500
Oh, my God.

172
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,740
I'm so sorry.

173
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:54,960
No.

174
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,700
Okay.

175
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,160
Give me a sec.

176
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,220
Okay.

177
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,920
Give me a sec.

178
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,540
This is way too low to sense.

179
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,600
Alright.

180
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,840
Mouse sensitivity.

181
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,800
I don't...

182
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,480
Okay.

183
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,360
Mouse scope...

184
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,700
Okay.

185
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,140
Mouse...

186
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,180
Why is it on 10?

187
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,720
Okay.

188
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,240
Mouse aim should definitely not be on 10.

189
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,560
Let me fix that real fast.

190
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,760
Okay.

191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,280
Let me...

192
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,500
No.

193
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,380
That's way too high.

194
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,940
The best part about being a gamer is that you're super anal about...

195
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,740
You're super focused.

196
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,500
You're super fucking anal when it comes to...

197
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,720
Oh, I have no bullets.

198
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,920
When it comes to sensitivity.

199
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,180
Step one.

200
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
Grab a fistful of freedom.

201
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,720
Send the swarm something warm.

202
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,700
Step two.

203
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,140
Penetrate and detonate.

204
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,380
Maximum death for maximum damage.

205
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,560
Terminate the...

206
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,540
Terminate the...

207
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,160
Termin...

208
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,720
Termin...

209
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,040
Headshot.

210
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,820
Nice.

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,560
More cheese, man.

212
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,740
Thank you for the aqua soup.

213
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,280
Thank you.

214
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:50,720
Thank you.

215
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,140
Alright.

216
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,720
So, I'm going to...

217
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:54,920
Is that it?

218
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,680
Where are the ones that keep coming?

219
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,860
Oh, pick up the grenades!

220
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,560
Okay.

221
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:00,940
Sorry.

222
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,620
I keep forgetting that I can't read.

223
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,880
How do I throw?

224
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,200
G to throw a grenade?

225
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
What do I throw?

226
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,720
In there?

227
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,460
Boop!

228
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,980
Nice!

229
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,280
Super destroyer.

230
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,700
Super destroyer.

231
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:21,820
Okay.

232
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,700
Ice.

233
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:24,720
Ice.

234
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,500
Use a stratagem now to take care of those...

235
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,040
Stratagem?

236
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,500
Just make sure you take a few steps back.

237
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,100
How do I do this?

238
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,200
Orbital WASD to die...

239
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,400
Oh!

240
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,340
Activating.

241
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm doing it!

242
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,040
Where is it?

243
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,560
Oh, throw it!

244
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,140
I'm doing it!

245
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,060
For real this time!

246
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,080
Sorry!

247
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,900
I keep forgetting to read.

248
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,140
Okay, now I got it.

249
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,420
It's okay, I'm doing it now.

250
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,980
I'm reading it!

251
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,020
I'm learning how to read, guys!

252
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,620
Look, you normally don't have to read in other FPS games.

253
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,420
Reading is a little hard.

254
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,160
How's the sound now?

255
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,640
Is it better?

256
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,120
Nice.

257
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,980
Yeah, it's just frie- yeah!

258
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,400
See?

259
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,040
It's like- it's just life!

260
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
Voice is a bit low?

261
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,660
Okay, don't worry, I got you guys!

262
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,520
Alright, that should be better.

263
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,000
Alright, control the whole strat- again?

264
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,460
Oh!

265
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,460
Okay.

266
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,580
Activating.

267
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,040
Throw the stratagem ball.

268
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,100
Right there, here.

269
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,180
Here?

270
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,660
Reinforce.

271
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,800
Whoa.

272
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,220
Greetings, soldier!

273
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,020
Are you doing your part?

274
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,620
If you don't do your part, you know what's gonna happen.

275
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,900
Just like America!

276
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,280
America!

277
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,000
Alright, what's this?

278
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,840
Moving makes it hard.

279
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
Stand still for maximum- But I don't wanna stand still.

280
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,360
Oh shit, whoops.

281
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,560
That's so easy.

282
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,820
What do I have to do to have Doki shoot me too?

283
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,580
Thank you for the Akasufa meme.

284
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,720
Thank you, thank you.

285
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,200
That it?

286
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,260
Oh, I need to throw it in.

287
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,380
Thank you for getting me to throw it in.

288
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,700
Thank you for getting me to throw it in.

289
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:55,820
Nice.

290
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,600
Woo!

291
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,300
Mill Mouse for first person?

292
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,640
It's not activating first- I think you have to get out of tutorial first.

293
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,440
To activate first person.

294
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,100
Don't reload.

295
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:12,760
Oh wait!

296
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,880
The mag is left up- What?

297
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,100
Really?

298
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,760
Really?

299
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,040
That's so dumb!

300
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,980
I'm so used to reloading all the time.

301
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,020
I just activate it here.

302
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,860
Oh!

303
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,440
Oh!

304
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:32,880
Oh!

305
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,140
Why would I ever- I'm gonna- I'm just gonna Fortnite this.

306
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,240
I- I don't think I would- This is actually disgusting.

307
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm sorry!

308
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,760
This actually looks fucking terrible.

309
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,480
It's not for me.

310
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,710
Hold the reload button.

311
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,610
You're- I mean, look- look at this!

312
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,990
It's so gross!

313
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:10,690
Like- I need to hold R for- Oh!

314
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,210
That's so interesting.

315
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,730
Alright, what is this?

316
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:24,010
Press 1, 2, 3 to swap your support or your- Uh...

317
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,370
What's my support gun?

318
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:25,710
Okay.

319
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,990
What is this?

320
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,330
Okay, what is this?

321
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,450
Do I have everything?

322
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,350
Alright, here we go.

323
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,510
I mean, it's so gross.

324
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,850
I can just- I can just aim in third person cause I'm not...

325
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:37,990
stupid.

326
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,950
This is not a competitive shooting!

327
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,850
Okay, maybe if I'm sniping- I'll do this.

328
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,810
Woah!

329
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,190
I might not be able to read!

330
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,150
But I know I'm not that stupid!

331
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,750
Wait, is that it?

332
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,550
What do I do?

333
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,230
Retrieve the flag of Super Earth.

334
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,030
Oh my god.

335
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,590
What's the difference between regular Earth and Super Earth?

336
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,410
More democracy?

337
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,630
I'm heading over!

338
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,990
What do I plant it here?

339
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,390
Is this where Super Earth goes?

340
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,290
Okay, no.

341
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,670
Oh, salute!

342
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,990
Press B to salute.

343
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,430
Sorry, I pressed N.

344
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,090
Oh, shit!

345
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,490
Okay.

346
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,130
Where's my other gun?

347
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,110
Where's my- There you go.

348
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,390
Oh, shit!

349
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:51,890
There's your granade!

350
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,150
If I- Hold left!

351
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,490
Oh, I need a grenade!

352
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,030
I need a grenade!

353
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,070
Oh, I don't need a grenade.

354
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,230
Super Earth has a cape!

355
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,230
Thank you, with the Super Chat!

356
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,970
I'm gonna- Thank you, thank you.

357
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,690
I know, right?

358
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,470
I'm so fucking good at this.

359
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,370
I can wear a cape!

360
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,870
I'm ready!

361
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,390
Dragons!

362
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,770
I'm just like you and- I have a younger me.

363
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,590
I'm doing my part!

364
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,190
Oh my god, it's it!

365
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,430
Justice!

366
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,640
Oh my god, that one...

367
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:52,240
Okay, to be fair, if it really takes like less than like 15 minutes to train a soldier to go to war, I don't think like we're winning this war.

368
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,640
I get the cool cape though!

369
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,760
But guys, I get a cool fucking cape!

370
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,480
Justice, welcome to the tomato farm!

371
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,160
Welcome, welcome!

372
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,820
Monster Envy, thank you for the super chat!

373
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,580
Thank you, thank you!

374
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,440
Regular Earth was destroyed in the first game.

375
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,460
Along with a bunch of super earths, they just move on to a new world and call it Super Earth.

376
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,640
It's mine now, smile.

377
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:23,920
Smile.

378
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,740
Oh god, I like this song.

379
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,100
I feel the democracy right now.

380
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,000
I really do feel the freedom.

381
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,520
Oh shit!

382
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,980
Wait, I can change my name?

383
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,400
Oh shit!

384
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,260
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

385
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,960
I wanna be called...

386
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,740
WINGS!

387
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:08,060
Wings of pride, of science, of starlight, of super wings of the people.

388
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,400
Okay, wait.

389
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,880
Of war, of victory, of twilight, of truth, of the stars.

390
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,320
Oh my god, what do we want wings of?

391
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,100
Wings of law.

392
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,960
Oh yeah, definitely not honor.

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,320
Of authority!

394
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,960
Of authority!

395
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,380
No, wait, wait, no.

396
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,180
Of democracy.

397
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,880
Wings of...

398
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,480
There was one that actually won.

399
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,080
Where was it?

400
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,660
Destruction, there we go.

401
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,780
Alright, doesn't matter whose side gets destroyed.

402
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm here for it.

403
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,240
Wings of destruction.

404
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,900
Is that me?

405
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
Where's my Kate?

406
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,600
Where's my Kate?

407
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,540
Hello.

408
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,740
I got in the server.

409
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,280
You're in charge of this vessel now.

410
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,620
The democracy officer awaits you on the bridge.

411
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,380
Welcome to the galactic war.

412
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,940
I'm doing my part.

413
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,740
Open your so- here you can see your friends activities and join a mission.

414
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,740
Alright.

415
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,220
Well, we're doing it solo.

416
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,560
We might try to queue like randoms and then have people yell at me.

417
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,060
Also, is the sound a lot better now?

418
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,720
Guys?

419
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,840
How's the sound so far?

420
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,320
My sound guy's not here so I don't know.

421
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,420
May liberty guide me.

422
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,100
What is orders?

423
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,760
Have launch, kill 60 enemies using.

424
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,600
It's okay now?

425
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,620
Sound is good?

426
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,580
Alright, nice.

427
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,760
I don't want it to be too loud.

428
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,260
That's really it for the background.

429
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:52,380
Go to the story bridge and use the- Okay, apparently, people were yelling at me and was like, Do not customize your character or you will crash.

430
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,680
So, like, I'm gonna make sure I don't customize.

431
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,100
The galaxy awaits your salvation.

432
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,020
Alright.

433
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,140
Where are you?

434
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,700
Here at war, you may cast your vote many times.

435
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,420
Alright.

436
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:11,440
Once on election day and another with every bullet bearing in an enemy combatant.

437
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:12,820
Alright.

438
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,760
The freedom of the galaxy- Where do I go?

439
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,320
Welcome to the galactic war.

440
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,820
Here, the community fights together against its common enemy.

441
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,180
The path to the barrier of planets is clear.

442
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:36,920
Upon each barrier of planets, engineers have begun construction of the Termin- Termin- control system, a network of massive towers that will cover each planet in the well-tested neurotoxins known as termicide.

443
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,080
Soon, our citizens will be able to rest easy, knowing their children are safe from the threats of being eaten alive.

444
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,320
But, like, are we the- But, did they live on the planet first?

445
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,080
Or did we live on the planet first?

446
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,780
Doesn't matter because they're the bad guys.

447
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,640
Because they're not about democracy!

448
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,640
Was that- Is that it?

449
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,220
Am I- Am I fitting in?

450
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,040
Am I-

451
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,980
Doesn't matter because they're not about freedom and democracy!

452
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,540
We deserve that planet!

453
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:21,280
Hovering over a sector shows you how much of its super- Earth has already been liberated.

454
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,380
Do not worry, in- in-sects!

455
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,560
We will liberate you!

456
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,160
Um...

457
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,060
All operations contribute to pushing the enemies of super-Earth back.

458
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,580
Select a sector to see what planets are currently playable.

459
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,260
Alright.

460
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,580
Is this...

461
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,060
Alright.

462
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,480
So, this is...

463
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,400
This is our planet.

464
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,720
So I guess we just go here, right?

465
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,860
Depending on the war progress, different planets will be available.

466
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,080
Select a planet to see what operations are available.

467
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,940
Oh, wait, they're 100% liberated already.

468
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,740
Oh shit, we gotta go in!

469
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,140
Alright.

470
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,520
Operation is a collection.

471
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,180
Okay, we're gonna go liberate.

472
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,500
Alright.

473
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,380
Spread democracy.

474
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,900
Raise the super-flag as an un-assailable beacon of liberty.

475
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,520
Don't worry, I'm coming in!

476
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
Wings of destruction is coming in!

477
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,780
To deliver freedom!

478
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,840
They definitely do not want me as a teammate, but it's too bad.

479
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,420
Shots fired.

480
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,680
I- Oh, hey guys!

481
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,580
I'm level one!

482
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,120
Um...

483
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,220
I'm just a little baby.

484
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,420
Babyyyyyy.

485
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,940
Do not worry!

486
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,020
Do not worry!

487
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,760
You didn't need any help!

488
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,680
But I'm coming in anyway!

489
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,960
Joe, thank you for the super chat!

490
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,920
Thank you, thank you!

491
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,340
Don't worry, Doki Bird.

492
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,220
You're manifesting destiny right now.

493
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,060
Nice, that's good to know.

494
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,720
Give me a sec, I'm still figuring this out.

495
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,540
Alright.

496
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,480
What do I- S-O-S?

497
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,420
Wait, I didn't- What- What's going on?!

498
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,960
I didn't get to see what was going on!

499
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,900
Where am I?!

500
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,820
I'm so confused!

501
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,540
Um...

502
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,940
Yes?

503
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,840
Is- Is this it?

504
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,580
Don't worry, I put- Push to talk.

505
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,740
Am I ready?

506
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,080
Wait, am I open mic?

507
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,820
No, no, I already changed it.

508
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,400
I already changed it to push to talk.

509
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,580
Don't worry guys, I made sure to change it to push to- I'm so confused.

510
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,300
But I think I'm ready.

511
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,920
It's okay!

512
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,340
This man's level 21!

513
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,840
There's no way I can fuck up!

514
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,640
He's literally level 21!

515
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,040
We can do this!

516
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,180
We can spread democracy!

517
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,720
We can get carried!

518
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,080
That's all that matters!

519
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,880
There's no way it's over!

520
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,280
We literally have a guy that's- First off, his name is Chief.

521
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,900
Second off, he's level 21.

522
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,300
Like, how can I fuck up?

523
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,180
Come on!

524
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,020
Come on!

525
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm confused and ready to do my part.

526
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,900
Alright!

527
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,720
Here I am!

528
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,520
Who's C3?

529
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,860
Oh, what are we doing?

530
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,040
Guard dog!

531
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,660
Okay!

532
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,560
What are you guys- What are you guys doing?

533
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,220
Biggest- Thank you for the super chat!

534
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,660
Thank you!

535
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,120
Thank you!

536
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,300
Thank you!

537
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:24,180
I'm- I'm a little confused, but I have- Who's the- Who's like the strongest one?

538
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,120
Who's the- New ta- Oh, they're calling in their weapons!

539
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,320
Do I have any weapons?

540
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,440
Sorry.

541
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,360
I don't- Call in your M- I don't need my MG!

542
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,640
I don't need my MG!

543
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,420
I need my MG!

544
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,080
Don't worry!

545
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,500
I will do my part!

546
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,500
I can aim!

547
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,800
We don't need MG's!

548
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,860
I can aim!

549
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,960
Guys!

550
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,900
That is- I can aim!

551
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,700
That's my part!

552
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,500
Fuck!

553
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,660
I forgot not to reload.

554
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,440
I need to remember not to reload.

555
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,740
Don't worry.

556
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,320
Here I am.

557
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,620
I'm on baby difficulty?

558
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,440
Then what are you guys saying about these level 21's on baby difficulty, huh?

559
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,840
What does that say about them?

560
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,080
Who are they calling?

561
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,220
They're calling so many things!

562
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,280
I'm doing my part.

563
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,960
Oh shit!

564
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,620
Oh shi- I can't see!

565
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,940
I'm doing it.

566
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,800
Don't worry.

567
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,680
I'm doing it.

568
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,500
They're the babysitters!

569
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,600
It's fine!

570
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,480
We're so good!

571
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,100
We're so good at this game!

572
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,380
Oh, I love my team!

573
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,740
I love my team!

574
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,460
For freedom and liberty!

575
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,200
Seeing isn't mandatory.

576
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,600
You do not need to see anything.

577
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,280
All you need to do is shoot.

578
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,220
So what do we do now guys?

579
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,620
Where is this song playing from?

580
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,060
You know what?

581
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,540
I do feel the freedom right now.

582
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,640
I do feel this freedom.

583
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,160
Oh I just loot the flag.

584
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,600
You're right.

585
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,580
We gotta wait for the flag.

586
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,800
I feel so patriotic with everything going on.

587
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,560
Oh oh!

588
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,600
Is there bugs behind us?

589
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,780
There's bugs behind us.

590
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,940
Don't worry.

591
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,580
We can do this.

592
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,380
What do I do?

593
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,360
Do I need a machine gun?

594
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,460
Nah.

595
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,460
Glory to Super Earth!

596
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,740
Yay!

597
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,680
Did someone die?

598
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,460
Oh my god!

599
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,200
What happened?

600
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
How did you die?

601
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,440
How the fuck did this guy die?

602
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,820
Did we save him?

603
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,800
How did we get across?

604
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,300
Did he step on the mine?

605
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,040
Did he step on... No!

606
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,680
The other baby!

607
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,880
Hahaha!

608
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,100
I... oh... oh... oh...

609
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,300
I hope I don't step on the mine.

610
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,780
He ran over the mine.

611
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,620
See guys?

612
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,260
I'm not the baby here.

613
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,260
Guys... I wasn't the baby here.

614
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,500
I didn't step in any mines.

615
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,500
Freedom comes at a cost, Doki.

616
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,320
You think it's gonna be easy?

617
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,780
Defend extraction zone.

618
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,460
I can do that.

619
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,220
Alright, use all your materials.

620
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,480
I'll just shoot my gun.

621
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,120
Little baby man.

622
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,940
He died a hero.

623
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,960
You either die a hero or you die... or you live as a coward.

624
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,820
Isn't that right guys?

625
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,820
Freedom is free.

626
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
That one guy.

627
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,820
Thank you Super Chef.

628
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,300
Thank you.

629
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:37,880
Thank you.

630
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,980
We need more men at the creek for Super Earth.

631
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,520
Look!

632
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm doing my part!

633
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,620
I'm shooting my gun!

634
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,760
Is that nice?

635
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,420
Oh my god.

636
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,680
This is the... this has to be the easiest game of my life.

637
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,060
Oh shit.

638
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,840
I shouldn't have reloaded.

639
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,380
Fuck.

640
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,000
I...

641
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,040
Oh my god.

642
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,700
So easy.

643
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,960
This game's been out for like a week and it's already got first community.

644
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,180
Shake my head.

645
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,280
Look.

646
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,620
See?

647
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,140
Look at that.

648
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,120
So easy.

649
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,830
Orbital inbound.

650
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,130
Wait.

651
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,370
Whoa!

652
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,520
Man down!

653
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,300
Man down!

654
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,070
Oh shit.

655
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,570
Oh shit.

656
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,130
I can't see!

657
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,410
I'm slowed!

658
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,740
We're good.

659
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,140
We're good.

660
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,500
Fire at hostile state clear on the field.

661
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,100
Nice.

662
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,450
Oh we got clear landing zone.

663
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,710
See I can listen.

664
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,730
This is it?

665
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,240
Where is it?

666
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,050
Oh my god.

667
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,550
It's coming in.

668
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,970
It's coming in.

669
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,090
The freedom's coming in.

670
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:15,570
Oh!

671
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,430
The baby!

672
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,050
Oh my god!

673
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:19,970
Please!

674
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,110
I'm a good person I swear!

675
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,510
Hahaha!

676
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,270
Oh I'm so scared!

677
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,110
I'm too scared I'm going in!

678
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:31,770
I'm too scared!

679
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,010
I'm scared he's gonna shoot me too!

680
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,650
I'm too scared!

681
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,430
I went inside and don't want him to shoot me!

682
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,330
I don't...

683
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:43,970
Hahaha!

684
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,130
He would... he would just witness the murder.

685
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,610
Hahaha!

686
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,690
Hahaha!

687
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,470
That's a true friendly fire!

688
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,410
This horror is on!

689
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,910
Oh my god!

690
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,770
They smell gunpowder.

691
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,690
I... I smell democracy.

692
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,590
We are not the same!

693
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:10,390
Hahaha!

694
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,790
Holy shit!

695
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,450
Oh my god!

696
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,610
Witness...

697
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,970
I witnessed a fucking murder!

698
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,810
I got so scared!

699
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:24,790
Hahaha!

700
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,570
Oh my god!

701
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:27,670
Yay!

702
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,850
Glorious victory!

703
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:30,910
Hahaha!

704
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,570
Hahaha!

705
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,090
The other baby... that could have been me!

706
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,150
Guys!

707
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,050
I could have been the baby that got shot!

708
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,490
Hahaha!

709
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:45,690
Hahaha!

710
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,390
Hahaha!

711
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,030
Hahaha!

712
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,470
Look at that!

713
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,590
First game!

714
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,370
First liberation!

715
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,530
Marines, we are leaving!

716
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,430
Thank you for the super chat!

717
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:00,870
Thank you!

718
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,430
Thank you!

719
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,090
Yay!

720
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,710
It was a lesson!

721
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,170
Hahaha!

722
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,310
Woo!

723
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,740
Oh my god!

724
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,620
This guy is like... suit is like decked out already!

725
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,540
Alright, I'm going back.

726
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,580
Where am I?

727
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,700
Okay, return to ship.

728
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,740
I unlocked... What difficulty was I in if I unlocked easy?

729
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,760
Excuse me?

730
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,460
There's a difficulty below zero?

731
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,440
Hahaha!

732
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,720
Hahaha!

733
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,100
What difficulty was I in?

734
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,560
Guys, I unlocked easy.

735
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,240
I can't believe it guys!

736
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,100
I can't believe I unlocked easy!

737
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,560
Alright, new customize... No, I'm too scared to customize after like...

738
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,620
That one chatter was like, do not customize!

739
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,420
How do I... How do I move this?

740
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,920
I wanna... I wanna go do war.

741
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,780
How come it won't let me do war?

742
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,760
I wanna leave this group.

743
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,340
Hahaha!

744
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,160
I don't wanna leave this...

745

871
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,020
Where's my thing?

873
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,720
Oh, there he is.

874
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,260

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,620
Oh my god!

884
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,640
He's like a dad teaching his...

885
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,320
Teenagers... teenage son how to play the game!

886
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,560
Wait, what's my mission?

887
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,380
I was not paying attention.

888
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,300
What if she was open mic?

889
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,120
No, I'm not.

890
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,820
I made sure I was not open mic.

891
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,100
Wait, where's our super citizen?

892
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,900

00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,980
Oh my god, look at them go.

895
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,640
Bug breach detected.

896
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,360
Don't worry!

897
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,900
The babies will stay in the back!

898
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,060
Go dads!

899
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,400

900
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,340

00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,840
I thought someone hit me.

902
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,400
I was just wondering where all the eggs are.

903
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,880
Don't worry!

904
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,980

Oh no!

919
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,440
When your friends die, you have to call them back in.

920
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,220
With the strat again.

921
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:31,420

00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,620
I'm not fucking healing jack shit.

935
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,700
We did it!

936
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,280
Bug holes, you just chuck a nade in them.

937
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,040
Kind of like grab holes, yeah?

938
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,340
We did it guys!

939
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,940
We did it!

940
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,760
I took a turretle rifle.

941
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,500
What the fuck?

942
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,500
Now I know... Now I realize why...

943
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,400
We normally don't do open vs... Like why we don't go into voice chat.

944
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,540
It's so hard to like listen to my class and do this.

945
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,400
Now...

946
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,660
Yeah, okay.

947
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,540
He's in class!

948
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,600

954
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,140

956
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,020

00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,900
It wasn't even TV!

959
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,620
He's literally playing video games while in class.

960
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,100
It's good to just take out all these albums and stuff.

961
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,620
Holy shit.

962
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,320
Bro, he's the teacher, bro.

963
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,080
He's the teacher.

964
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,140
Yeah, I was like, I'm fucking... I'm just trying to figure out shit.

965
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,080
He's just like me for real.

966
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,820
For real.

967
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,540

That's actually great.

Look at that!

975
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,040
You don't have to pay tuition!

976
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,880
You can literally learn everything from my stream!

977
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,780
Is he gonna be on the test?

978
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:03,660
Doki!

979
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,660

981
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,100

Yeah, he is.

990
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,080
Am I stuck?

991
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,020

00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,020
Oh, there you go.

00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,280
Destroying enemies of super before the school.

1007
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,880
Tuition down payment.

1013
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,920
What do I use?

1014
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,100
I don't know what to use so I'm just gonna shoot my gun.

1015
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,740
Finally, the free education.

1016
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,200
I've always wanted it.

1021
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,230

1023
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,220
Oh god, I hope I'm not shooting.

1024
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,560
Don't worry!

1025
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,520

1026
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,820

00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,780
I was hoping the other guy would do it.

1030
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,840
Don't worry, I'm doing it!

1031

Guys, I'm sorry I'm too busy trying to pay attention to class right now!

1035
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,580
Okay?

Whoa!

1049
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:37,140
As an American, I appreciate the free education today.

1050
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,860
This is the freedom we strive for.

1051

00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,100
You're so right.

1062
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,180

We must know.

1084
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,900
We must know what he's learning.

1085
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,240
Alright, nice.

1086
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,760
Are you learning about freedom, son?

1087
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,480
Mission at 30 minutes remaining.

1088
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,840
Don't worry, we finished it, we're just extraction now.

1089
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,960
It's extractions now.

1090
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,940
Welcome to Tokyo.

1091
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,720
I've got 10 minutes of class left.

1092
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,200
Stop!

1093
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,560
There's something weird to the left here.

1094
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,960
It's like some medals or something.

1095
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,820
We gotta finish this before class is over!

1096
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,840
Guys!

1097
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,820
Bro is not learning.

1098
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,700
I don't know.

1099
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,800
It's okay, dude.

1100
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,760
Oh my god.

1101
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:17,580
Guys!

1102
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,500
We need to hurry before his class is over!

1103
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,560
We need to hurry before his class is over!

1104
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,320
Or he won't be able to...

1105
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,200
People will think it's suspicious if he's not leaving his class.

1106
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,740
I guess we'll just extract here.

1107
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,600
Whoa!

1108
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:36,980
Ow!

00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,620
I'm following C3.

1110
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,020
I'm following C3.

1111
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,100
We gotta do it for Super Earth and his education!

1112
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,220
We gotta do it for Super Earth and his education!

1113
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,300
Okay, nice.

1114
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,160
Nice.

1115
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:51,980
Thank you, C3.

1116
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,120
Thank you, Super Citizen!

1117
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,020
Oh my god!

1118
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,040
He smiled too!

1119
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,200
He smiled at me!

1120
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,620
Oh my god.

1121
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,480
Look at him.

1122
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,600
Team player.

1123
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,040
Okay, okay.

1124
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,080
I'll ask him later.

1125
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,240
When we're not getting like...

1126
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,780
When we're not trying to like, you know, survive.

1127
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,640
When we're not getting like...

1128
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,380
I'm doing my part.

1129
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,800
I'm doing my part.

1130
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,580
Where will he come from?

1131
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,440
Ask him to turn up the volume.

1132
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,180
No goons if you don't.

1133
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,940
Bruce, thank you for the Super Chat.

1134
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,360
Thank you.

1135
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:28,880
Bruce, thank you for the Super Chat.

1136
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,400
Thank you.

1137
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,440
Not bad.

1138
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,480
Not bad though.

1139
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,980
Now he's asking us if we can hear him.

1140
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:38,420
Now he's asking us if we can hear him.

1141
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:38,640
Bro!

1142
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,060
I was like, wait, can you guys actually?

1143
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,800
Nice.

1144
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,200
Oh my god, I just got like 13 kills of better.

1145
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,280
Nice.

1146
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,560
We're doing it.

1147
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,900
Is there any other insects coming from this way or is it all from here?

1148
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,340
I don't think we even need to shoot our guns.

1149
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,380
Okay, I'll help this way.

1150
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,600
Ask to compare notes.

1151
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,080
Ask to compare notes.

1152
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,700
He asked me like, How's your class going on right now?

1153
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,460
Like...

1154
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,600
Have you been like taking any notes?

1155
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,200
Whoa!

1156
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:21,760
Shit.

1157
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,100
Jesus Christ.

1158
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:24,760
Nice.

1159
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,060
Extraction 26.

1160
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,460
Okay, I'm gonna ask in like 10 seconds.

1161
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,660
This is so calm compared to like the first one.

1162
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:32,820
Oh, shit.

1163
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,520
I'm not even playing on that hard.

1164
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,280
In 10 seconds we'll ask them.

1165
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,000
Ridiculous.

1166
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,500
I can use my mini-map to see where the enemies are.

1167
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,340
Constant onslaught.

1168
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,340
Yeah, but I'm lazy.

1169
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,040
Alright, here it is.

1170
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,420
Here it is.

1171
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,460
So what class is it?

1172
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,020
I'm

1173
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:00,610
talking!

1174
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,250
He's so embarrassed!

1175
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,730
You can extract your sets.

1176
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:12,970
You'll never know!

1177
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,630
You'll never know what class it was!

1178
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,280
They're like, A woman!

1179
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,900
So what class were you in?

1180
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,840
That's uh...

1181
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,720
MRI.

1182
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,500
MRI?

1183
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,480
So I'm doing a...

1184
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,060
Fuck.

1185
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,280
What are you... which class?

1186
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,040
This is my uh...

1187
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,140
I don't even know what he's learning!

1188
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,060
It's the sequence parameters and shit.

1189
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,940
Sequence parameters?

1190
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,040
All about the peg, feg, and sec, and coding gradients, and fuckin' MROs.

1191
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,240
But it's a review, so I'm like, I don't give a shit anymore.

1192
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,660
He's so immense!

1193
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,540
I'm like, I actually fucking did my homework, so I'm good.

1194
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:10,900
I'm like, I actually fucking did my homework, so I'm good.

1195
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,060
Wait, he's a doctor?!

1196
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,660
He's an actual doctor?!

1197
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,780
He's an actual doctor?!

1198
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,320
Bro, oh he's a technician!

1199
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,600
Oh my god!

1200
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,100
Bro, he did his homework, guys!

1201
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,340
Guys!

1202
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,320
He did his fucking homework!

1203
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,620
He doesn't give a fuck!

1204
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,640
This is our future doctor!

1205
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:40,900
This is our future doctor!

1206
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,620
Ready for freedom!

1207
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,260
The technician for...

1208
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,760
Oh my god.

1209
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,020
I don't want this person to...

1210
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:02,640
If I'm getting an MRI scan, and like, this is...

1211
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,640
I'm leaving.

1212
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,100
I'm leaving.

1213
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,600
Goodbye.

1214
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,800
He's a combat medic.

1215
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,720
Guys, I can't believe it.

1216
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,260
I basically gave you guys a free medical lecture.

1217
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,660
Right there.

1218
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,660
Okay, but if he's like...

1219
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,360
If like...

1220
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,520
MRI... There's something wrong with the MRI.

1221
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,980
And he was too busy to like...

1222
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,980
know what to do because he was playing Helldivers.

1223
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,760
I would be scared.

1224
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,880
I would be very scared.

1225
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,180
A true patriot saving lives both as a medical staff and kill bugs.

1226
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,240
Glory to Super Earth.

1227
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,960
I mean, thank you for the Akka soup, but thank you.

1228
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,660
Thank you.

1229
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,680
Maj!

1230
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,980
Good to know the medical future of Super Earth is in good hands.

1231
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,640
Thank you for the super chat.

1232
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,000
Thank you.

1233
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,640
Thank you.

1234
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,020
I can't believe it.

1235
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,860
We had a real doctor with us, guys!

1236
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,480
Holy fuck!

1237
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,500
We had a medical combat officer.

1238
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,580
We had a medical combat officer.

1239
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:14,980
We had a medical combat officer.

1240
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:15,200
We had a medical combat officer.

1241
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,500
I was paying attention to his class more than he was.

1242
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1243
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:21,820
Thank you.

1244
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,520
Thank you.

1245
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Alright, let's see.

1246
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,300
Spread democracy.

1247
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:26,960
Let's see.

1248
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,060
Oh my god.

1249
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,620
How was the volume throughout all of that?

1250
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,460
I guess it was pretty good because you guys were able to listen to it.

1251
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,520
It was class, right?

1252
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,740
Choose where you will use your race.

1253
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:47,420
I'm pretty sure it was all right because you guys could actually learn from his class.

1254
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,780
Can I do the medium now?

1255
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,900
Get down there and eradicate them.

1256
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,380
Yeah, that was fine.

1257
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,620
We heard everything.

1258
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,880
Alright, one, one out of four.

1259
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,240
Learned a lot.

1260
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,540
I'm now a doctor.

1261
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,000
I wanted to learn more from him.

1262
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,480
You're like, Doki, why did you leave this team?

1263
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,020
We could have learned so much!

1264
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,400
We could have had another lecture!

1265
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,960
There's nothing in medium, guys.

1266
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,500
I literally can't find a medium planet.

1267
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,220
Is there a medium planet here?

1268
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,280
Have to complete a section to unlock... Oh, I need to complete a section to unlock this...

1269
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,020
Okay, we gotta keep fucking saving the world.

1270
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,780
Alright let's see, one outta four.

1271
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,620
I could have had a higher education.

1272
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,860
Guys, this is the strat!

1273
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:49,440
Guys, no no, this is the strat guys, all we have to do...

1274
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,940
...is, umm, we just keep fucking queuing up until we can find more doctors.

1275
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,260
So like, instead of like going to school, we can leech off of their education.

1276
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,320
Come on guys!

1277
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,780
Think about fucking the chips.

1278
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,260
Think about...

1279
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,780
Thank you!

1280
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,980
What the fuck is going on?

1281
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,260
Alright.

1282
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,760
Nice.

1283
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,360
Who's our babysitter?

1284
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:19,560
Wait, what?

1285
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,000
Did they finish?

1286
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,520
Did they fin- Where am I?

1287
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,020
Am I- Wait!

1288
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,900
They kicked me out already?!

1289
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,020
I think they did it.

1290
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,220
They're like, oh- I'm kicked from the game!

1291
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,620
Bro!

1292
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,740
I know I'm just a baby, but I wanna be included!

1293
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,640
I can't believe I got kicked!

1294
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,320
The Clutcher kicked me!

1295
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,580
They saw the level and was like, no.

1296
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,320
We cannot let this baby- play.

1297
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,400
Okay, perch, hatchet trees.

1298
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:07,940
Alright.

1299
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,820
Can't join this team.

1300
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,440
No women!

1301
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,180
Alright, here we go.

1302
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,000
Wait, we're all babies here.

1303
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,100
This is not good.

1304
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,320
Guys!

1305
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,100
Guys!

1306
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,740
Where's our super citizen?!

1307
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,220
Be gone, child!

1308
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,660
Guys, this is not good!

1309
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,080
Oh no!

1310
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,940
We're the baby team!

1311
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,580
Who's gonna hold my head?!

1312
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,690
Where's our MRI tech?!

1313
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,590
Don't worry babies!

1314
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,230
It can't be that bad!

1315
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,290
Oops, sorry, I keep forgetting.

1316
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:03,390
Uhhhhhhhhhh...

1317
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,510
This is my machine gun.

1318
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:05,890
This is my machine gun.

1319
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,110
Oop!

1320
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,550
I'm gonna get my machine gun.

1321
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,290
Alright, let me get my machine gun.

1322
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,290
Use your orb, laser, and star gem for a large group before they notice you.

1323
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,310
Open the mini-map to see mission and side location.

1324
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,790
Alright, how do I open my mini-map again?

1325
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:24,930
Oh shit!

1326
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,390
There's fall damage?!

1327
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,550
I have armor!

1328
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:30,270
Okay.

1329
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:34,010
If I wear armor, there should be no fall damage.

1330
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,530
That should be a rule.

1331
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,110
That should be...

1332
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,490
Oh, there it is.

1333
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,470
Oh my god!

1334
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:42,150
There it is!

1335
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,410
You guys can't see it, but I'm looking at it right now.

1336
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,810
I like just destroy the eggs from here.

1337
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:49,610
Oh, I can.

1338
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:50,850
I don't even have to walk over.

1339
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:52,050
Nice.

1340
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:55,170
Nice.

1341
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:56,670
Don't worry!

1342
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,270
We are... we might be babies!

1343
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,530
But babies are strong together!

1344
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,910
Three babies can make one super citizen!

1345
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:07,690
Oh!

1346
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:09,930
Babies!

1347
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,220
Guys, we all had one job.

1348
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,760
Guys, what happened to our one job together?

1349
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,260
We should be strong together, babies.

1350
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,420
Here we go.

1351
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:33,080
Wow, the difference between not getting killed...

1352
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,280
Oh, I'm so happy.

1353
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,740
I'm so happy.

1354
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,660
It's a... it's a huge difference.

1355
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,900
Oh, shit!

1356
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,860
Why heal when I can make them heal for me?

1357
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,320
Why use my own resources, guys?

1358
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,360
What the fuck?

1359
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:53,980
It's not...

1360
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,760
It's not...

1361
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,060
It's not...

1362
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,640
It's not...

1363
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,640
It's not...

1364
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,480
It's not...

1365
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,820
It's not...

1366
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,080
It's not...

1367
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,600
I feel like I wasted that.

1368
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,200
Babies together strong!

1369
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,220
Okay.

1370
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:11,840
It's alright.

1371
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:12,440
It's okay.

1372
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,080
This is fine.

1373
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,040
I don't need ammo, guys.

1374
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,520
This is fine.

1375
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,020
Look at us go!

1376
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:21,780
We're so strong!

1377
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,020
Alright.

1378
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,840
We're gonna get rid of all of these.

1379
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,380
Okay.

1380
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,160
I don't need the pistol.

1381
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,220
It's alright.

1382
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,500
We're destroying it!

1383
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,400
We did it, guys!

1384
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,480
Yoink.

1385
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,240
Yoink.

1386
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,380
Alright.

1387
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:46,100
I swear, if I fucking get fall damage, I fucking swear.

1388
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,060
Okay.

1389
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,180
Now, I'm like so paranoid right now.

1390
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,560
I'm actually so paranoid.

1391
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,060
Oh, shit.

1392
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,660
Oh, my God.

1393
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:58,900
Do not worry.

1394
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,560
Liberty is coming.

1395
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:02,200
Oh, shit.

1396
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:12,560
It's like, those birds that like lay their eggs on the side of the cliff and when they like, grow up, when they like, are at age, it- the parents like kick them out of the nest to learn how to fly.

1397
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,080
If they don't fly, they just die.

1398
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,600
That's us right now.

1399
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,900
That's actually us right now.

1400
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,960
It's time for us to fly, guys.

1401
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,460
To spread democracy!

1402
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,020
We must be kicked out of the nest.

1403
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,140
Alright.

1404
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,840
Oh, there's this one guy coming up.

1405
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,020
Okay, I'm a little scared because I'm running out of ammo.

1406
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,440
I need to like call my...

1407
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,940
That's fucking right!

1408
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,800
Guys, can we like move on?

1409
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,560
It's okay, we don't have to kill them!

1410
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,460
Spread the wings of freedom.

1411
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,800
Who am I playing with?

1412
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,760
I'm playing with a... well, my last partner was a doctor.

1413
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,860
He was learning about MRIs.

1414
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,980
Okay, let's see.

1415
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,360
Where's the resupply?

1416
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,420
I don't have the resupply.

1417
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:13,660
What?

1418
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,540
A quote-unquote doctor.

1419
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,940
I hope he passes his exams.

1420
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,280
Look, he did his homework guys.

1421
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,840
You guys remember what he said?

1422
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,300
He was like, I did the homework.

1423
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,080
Do not retreat.

1424
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,740
Defend liberty at all costs.

1425
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,540
But my ammo!

1426
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,060
I don't have... what are we doing?

1427
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,060
Okay.

1428
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,140
Oh no.

1429
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,120
Oh no, the bugs are coming.

1430
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,940
The bugs are coming.

1431
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,140
Am I... alright.

1432
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,300
I'm helping.

1433
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:46,980
Okay.

1434
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,660
But he passed the pills.

1435
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,280
How do I demonstrate your MRI?

1436
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,380
Is that worth it?

1437
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,580
Would you want your MRI technique?

1438
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:00,080
What do you mean?

1439
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,280
If you don't have the mission to be like playing Helldivers?

1440
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,020
I need to know.

1441
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:11,920
If you're about to get an MRI scan and your doctor is out here playing Helldivers, and that is why your MRI scan is getting delayed.

1442
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,160
Is that okay?

1443
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:16,940
Hell, yeah.

1444
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,280
If it's for freedom.

1445
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,000
Fuck, yeah, it is.

1446
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,840
Oh my god, I keep accidentally proning.

1447
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,040
Okay.

1448
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,480
Okay, do I have enough for resupply?

1449
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,220
God damn it.

1450
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:35,960
I would get an MRI scan by a patriot!

1451
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,520
It's for a worthy cause!

1452
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,320
That's fucking right!

1453
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,320
Good answer!

1454
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,360
It was a test all along!

1455
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:51,880
Of fucking course you want your MRI scan by a goddamn American of super-hearts!

1456
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,000
Yay!

1457
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,560
We did it!

1458
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,140
Get a super MRI.

1459
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,730
All right, here we go.

1460
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,370
Where are you going guys?

1461
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:08,250
Babies!

1462
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,530
Where are we going babies?

1463
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:11,890
Hallelujah brothers!

1464
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:15,970
Get a freedom MRI!

1465
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,710
With extra freedom!

1466
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:28,210
Why check map when I can just follow one person?

1467
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:30,990
See?

1468
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:33,070
I don't need to check anything.

1469
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:34,910
They're doing it all for me.

1470
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:35,990
Oh nice.

1471
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:37,210
I need the ammo actually.

1472
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:40,610
Nice.

1473
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:44,890
Oh, is it more supplies?

1474
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:47,710
Oh, more supplies.

1475
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:48,610
I like that.

1476
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:52,880
Oh, nice.

1477
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:53,780
More reload.

1478
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:01,000
The donation to further cause a managed democracy.

1479
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1480
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,040
Thank you.

1481
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,420
Thank you.

1482
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:04,900
Thank you, Major.

1483
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:11,260
Kaz, there won't be any bucks in that MRI!

1484
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1485
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:14,280
Thank you.

1486
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:14,940
Thank you.

1487
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,960
Thank you.

1488
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,500
I mean, oh shit!

1489
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:22,220
Fucking yeah!

1490
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,280
Fuck yeah, brothers!

1491
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,220
Yeah, I feel bad taking that medal.

1492
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:29,340
Like...

1493
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,460
All right, nice.

1494
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:32,840
Okay.

1495
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:34,420
I just want to make sure I have...

1496
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,020
enough ammo for...

1497
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:36,280
Oh, hey!

1498
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:37,520
It's daytime now!

1499
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:37,980
Nice!

1500
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:39,580
Oh?

1501
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,160
There's like people behind us.

1502
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,220
Wait, they can fly?!

1503
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,180
Oh wait, they're bugs.

1504
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,080
Of course they can fly.

1505
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,520
All right.

1506
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,260
It's all right.

1507
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:51,620
We're fine.

1508
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,400
You have to go like this way.

1509
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:58,260
Nowhere.

1510
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,160
Oh, the loot is shared?

1511
01:07:59,340 --> 01:07:59,660
Nice.

1512
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,280
All right, guys.

1513
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,080
Look, I can look at the map too!

1514
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,400
I can look at the map too!

1515
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,340
Oh, it's over here.

1516
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,200
That's where they are.

1517
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,820
Pull down to the machine gun.

1518
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,360
All right, we gotta...

1519
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,260
We gotta go kill the big mama.

1520
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,580
You know what?

1521
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:17,080
Fuck this.

1522
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:17,840
I'm just gonna throw it.

1523
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,460
I already have so many nades anyway.

1524
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,760
It's fine.

1525
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,980
I can aim.

1526
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,000
Oh, great!

1527
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,280
They fly now!

1528
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,300
Wait, bug breach?

1529
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,340
What does that mean?

1530
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,940
Where is it coming from?

1531
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,140
Where is the bug breach coming from?

1532
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,780
Where is the bug breach coming from?

1533
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:38,800
Oh.

1534
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:39,640
Oh.

1535
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,060
That means reload.

1536
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:41,660
Reload!

1537
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:42,700
Reloading!

1538
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:44,620
Reloading!

1539
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,480
Don't let him get any nades!

1540
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:45,940
Don't touch me!

1541
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:49,960
Oh shit.

1542
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,680
Get the ones that fly!

1543
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,140
We gotta put the ones that fly down!

1544
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:54,660
Okay.

1545
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,200
Liberty!

1546
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:57,980
Liberty!

1547
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:00,300
All right, we can go up, right?

1548
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,400
I hope I get to go to medium difficulty soon.

1549
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,180
I...

1550
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:07,980
Here they come!

1551
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:12,970
All right.

1552
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:14,610
We gotta shoot them in the head.

1553
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:17,030
Okay.

1554
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:17,670
Please.

1555
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:20,650
The drag for this.

1556
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:23,470
Nice.

1557
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:24,330
All right.

1558
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,250
Can we go up?

1559
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,270
Can we go up now?

1560
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,670
Guys, we have enough violence!

1561
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,470
I think I'm ready for medium.

1562
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,230
Guys, it can't be that hard.

1563
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:37,650
All right.

1564
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:38,110
I'm going in.

1565
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:39,470
I'm going in.

1566
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,210
I ain't afraid!

1567
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:45,470
These guns are made for Super Earth!

1568
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:46,530
These guns are made for Super Earth!

1569
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:48,850
All right.

1570
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:49,770
We got rid of these guys.

1571
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:51,310
Okay.

1572
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,110
Please don't shoot me.

1573
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:52,650
Woohoo!

1574
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:54,650
Nice.

1575
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,390
Extraction available.

1576
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:56,270
Where do we go?

1577
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:57,990
All right.

1578
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:58,690
We gotta go to extraction.

1579
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,230
Let's go, babies!

1580
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:01,510
Let's go!

1581
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,770
Thank you for the super chat!

1582
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:04,130
Thank you!

1583
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:04,710
Thank you!

1584
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:05,950
I'm gonna miss this.

1585
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:08,570
Babies!

1586
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:09,390
Let's go, babies!

1587
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:11,690
I'm going the wrong way!

1588
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:12,510
Don't follow me!

1589
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,010
No!

1590
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:20,910
Never mind!

1591
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:23,430
Don't follow me!

1592
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:28,990
All right.

1593
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:31,810
The moment I tried to lead, I already went the wrong way.

1594
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:32,990
Like, I don't...

1595
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,030
I don't know.

1596
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,610
For Super Earth...

1597
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,430
The super special soldier...

1598
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,730
I'm just directionally challenged!

1599
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,710
What is this?

1600
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:48,790
I got a sample.

1601
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:49,670
What is it for?

1602
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,310
Look, that's not my fault!

1603
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:54,530
I just...

1604
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,050
I'm gonna wait for them to interact.

1605
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,270
What's this?

1606
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,170
Do you need a transport?

1607
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:03,030
Is there anything else to loot?

1608
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:06,910
It took Doki longer to kill them than the actual one.

1609
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:07,810
All right!

1610
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:11,670
Thank you for the super chat, Tai!

1611
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:12,610
Thank you!

1612
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,110
All right.

1613
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:16,890
Are you guys ready?

1614
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:18,010
I'm not.

1615
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:18,690
Okay.

1616
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,260
All right.

1617
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:23,660
We're ready.

1618
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,180
All right, guys!

1619
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,140
I don't think you guys were ready, but we're ready now.

1620
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,600
You guys might have not actually been ready, but we're ready now, guys.

1621
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,500
Do not worry!

1622
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,960
We don't need a super citizen!

1623
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,560
We are super together!

1624
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,440
Baby's never ready.

1625
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,200
There's enough of us to be ready!

1626
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,840
Oh my god.

1627
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,860
Wait, if this was easy, then why the fuck was that level 41 in the easy lobby?

1628
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:58,340
What...

1629
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,560
What is he doing?

1630
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,100
Is it to boost his own ego?

1631
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,780
To be like, look at these little babies?

1632
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:08,600
Okay.

1633
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,160
Get rid of these guys.

1634
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,420
T-chain babysitting.

1635
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,360
Yeah, but the super citizen was not a friend of them!

1636
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:21,820
Like...

1637
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,020
I'm pretty sure...

1638
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:25,260
Whoa!

1639
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,060
Probably farming resources.

1640
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,040
We gotta farm resources?

1641
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:36,140
What?

1642
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,500
Oh, there's like one of them all the way back there.

1643
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,100
Sniped them from all the way here.

1644
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,560
Flexing his level, I guess.

1645
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,480
It was nice though.

1646
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,300
The C3 guy.

1647
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,120
That was just like...

1648
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,280
Being like, pick this up.

1649
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,260
And I was like, yeeeah!

1650
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,740
Oh, the resources are the samples I'm picking up.

1651
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:01,320
Oh, I see.

1652
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,540
I guess they like upgrade your ship and everything, right?

1653
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,260
Helping newbies, I guess.

1654
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,500
Oh my god, like true... like true...

1655
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,400
Freedom fighters.

1656
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,320
ART, thank you for the super chat!

1657
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:19,700
Thank you!

1658
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,300
Thank you!

1659
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,640
Go, go, Doki Bear!

1660
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,780
This is great to watch!

1661
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:23,720
FREEDOM!

1662
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,020
Alright, go.

1663
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:34,540
Can you actually get like... Can you actually die from the ship landing on you?

1664
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,180
Is that possible?

1665
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:40,200
We're super... like a true super citizen.

1666
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,660
Babies, we did it!

1667
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,760
We fucking did it, babies!

1668
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,220
Babies!

1669
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,560
Oh my god!

1670
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,180
Look at us!

1671
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,400
We fucking did it, babies!

1672
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,600
We don't need a babysitter!

1673
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,640
We are the babysitter!

1674
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,200
Look at us go!

1675
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,060
We even did the optional objective.

1676
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,690
I cannot smell freedom.

1677
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:20,690
We're fucking doomed.

1678
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:21,790
Can we do that?

1679
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:22,810
Oh, we didn't do that.

1680
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:24,090
I didn't know how to do that.

1681
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:25,290
Nice.

1682
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,690
We had to multitask.

1683
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:31,470
Whoa!

1684
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:33,510
Five stars!

1685
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:34,950
Yeah!

1686
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,050
We got five stars!

1687
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,930
Alright, our goal today is to unlock medium.

1688
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:42,410
What?

1689
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:43,810
He gets to level up and I can?

1690
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,470
What did he do?

1691
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:49,710
You!

1692
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:51,310
The squad impact... zero?

1693
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,310
Wait, was it fully liberated already?

1694
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:54,570
Have we...

1695
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:57,130
Have we colonized the planet and rid of...

1696
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,530
rid of the anti-freedom monsters?

1697
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:07,430
He did more democracy.

1698
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:14,210
Oh, it's not liberate... liberated?

1699
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:15,370
Oh, it's not liberate...

1700
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:15,370
liberated?

1701
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,150
Okay, where's my ship?

1702
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:17,670
I need to get to the other ship.

1703
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:17,910
I need to go to the other ship.

1704
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:18,350
Oh, it's not liberated?

1705
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:18,830
I got medium!

1706
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:19,310
Let's go!

1707
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:21,390
That's all I wanted!

1708
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:23,090
See ya, suckers.

1709
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:25,750
I got what I want and I'm leaving you.

1710
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,360
There we go.

1711
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,760
We're finally... we're finally teenagers now!

1712
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,640
We've upgraded from babies to teenagers!

1713
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,800
Or is it like tweens?

1714
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,660
Are we tweens?

1715
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,780
I feel like we're tweens now.

1716
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:46,740
Guys!

1717
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,480
From babies to tweens!

1718
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,440
Let's go!

1719
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,640
We're preteens!

1720
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,420
We gotta upgrade our ship.

1721
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,580
I threw them away like, I'm done playing with you.

1722
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,900
Can I afford anything?

1723
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:03,880
I can't!

1724
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,120
I'm still too fucking broke!

1725
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,120
Are you serious?

1726
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,820
Guys, I'm still broke.

1727
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,300
I can't afford anything.

1728
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,760
Why do you guys want me to go?

1729
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,420
You just want me to... Okay, change my ship.

1730
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,940
Oh wait, this is...

1731
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:18,540
Guys...

1732
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,080
Why did you guys make me look at this when you know I'm broke?

1733
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,640
Oh, I can purchase these!

1734
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,500
Wait, I can!

1735
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:31,300
Wait, I can!

1736
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:31,900
Okay, wait.

1737
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,000
What do I purchase?

1738
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,280
I can buy the yellows.

1739
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,380
Okay, orbital, galling, barrage...

1740
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,320
Eoschafing, cluster bomb...

1741
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,480
Precision...

1742
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,560
Anti-personnel...

1743
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,720
Supply pack...

1744
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,860
What about allows you to distribute boxes?

1745
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,440
Oh my god, I can be like...

1746
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,280
Uber Eats.

1747
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,910
Hello, Uber Eats here.

1748
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:06,670
Doki Eats.

1749
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:09,130
Hello, did anyone order some Doki Eats?

1750
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,870
Doki delivery service.

1751
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:15,950
Alright, which Eats?

1752
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:16,690
What Ego do I get?

1753
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:19,910
Ego cluster?

1754
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,290
Or I'll get the Ego cluster.

1755
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:23,770
Alright, I can afford it.

1756
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,830
Hey Doki, I was at level 20 in your last match.

1757
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:29,790
I didn't have a payment thing set up.

1758
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,490
I'm a bit late on the job for this.

1759
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:32,530
It was a really nice match.

1760
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:33,290
Thank you!

1761
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:33,990
Oh my god!

1762
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:35,770
That's the super... Are you the super citizen?

1763
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:39,210
You were the one that was listening to the lecture with me?

1764
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:41,310
Thank you for the super chat.

1765
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,570
Thank you, thank you.

1766
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,230
It's him!

1767
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:51,850
He was the one holding my hand to be like, pick this fucking shield up.

1768
01:17:55,770 --> 01:17:58,550
No, no, this one wasn't the medical student.

1769
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:02,050
He was the other guy listening to the medical student.

1770
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,750
He and I were both listening.

1771
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:09,070
He was the super citizen just listening.

1772
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:15,390
Alright, let's see.

1773
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:19,350
Let's see.

1774
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:20,850

1775
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,510
Okay, here we go, let's see.

1776
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:26,470
Launch... Wait, you guys want to see robots.

1777
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,290
What is the robots?

1778
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:29,230
Okay, let's see.

01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,390
Eliminate Charger.

1780
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:31,910
Would it say like robots?

1781
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,130
Activate Pums, Purge, Hatcheries...

1782
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,050
Let's see, press R on the ship to spend medals.

1783
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:40,350
Ooh!

01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,530

1785
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:42,330
Battle Pass?

1786
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:44,330
I can spend it on Fortnite Battle Pass?

1787
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:46,970
Where is it?

1788
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:50,450
On the Super Store?

1789
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:52,570
No.

1790
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:53,610
Super Credits?

1791
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:54,010
No.

1792
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,230
Okay, War Bounds.

1793
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,590
Zero medals spent.

1794
01:18:57,890 --> 01:18:58,610
Do I go here?

1795
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,810
What is this?

1796
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,330
Can get better cape?

1797
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:04,570
Ooh, wait.

1798
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:06,590
What do I get?

1799
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:07,310
Oh, wait.

1800
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:07,390
Wait.

1801
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:10,310
Let's see.

1802
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:11,090
What can I afford?

1803
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:12,950
I can afford...

1804
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:18,950
Okay, wait.

1805
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:19,550
I'm buying this.

1806
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,090
No, it's locked!

1807
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,710
No!

1808
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:24,370
But this is the best one!

1809
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:30,470
I like how you guys are like, get the gun!

1810
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:33,550
And I'm just like, put the finger guns.

1811
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:34,170
No.

1812
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:40,110
You guys are like, Doki, no!

1813
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,770
Get the gun, Doki!

1814
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:43,450
And I'm like, finger guns?

1815
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,310
Finger guns?

1816
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,930
But finger guns are so much better!

1817
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,250
What do you mean?

1818
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:53,890
The finger guns is cooler!

1819
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:55,990
You don't understand!

1820
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:58,690
I regret clapping too.

1821
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,490
No, I want to equip it.

1822
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:00,810
No.

1823
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:01,390
How do I equip?

1824
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:02,770
I'm too scared.

1825
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,290
Finger guns.

1826
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,890
The finger guns is important!

1827
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:11,230
You don't understand!

1828
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:13,650
I'm so scared!

1829
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:18,610
Because of that one person that was like, be careful, it might crash your game.

1830
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:21,090
So I'm always like, scared now.

1831
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,070
Okay.

1832
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:26,010
What did I... I got like, a character.

1833
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:26,570
Okay.

Oh, nice.

There you go.

1840
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:36,570
Clapping.

1841
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,510
I want... that's good.

1842
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,370
That's good that it's fixed.

1843
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,990
They fixed it.

1844
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:40,970
Okay.

1845
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,350
Okay, it's randomized.

1846
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,630
Oh no, I want to be brawny!

1847
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,150
Alright, here we go.

1848
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,290
Let's go.

1849
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:55,990
Alright.

1850
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,190
Let's see.

1851
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:58,350
Are we at... we're at medium now.

1852
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:02,550
We need to liberate this planet.

1853
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:02,950
Alright.

1854
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:05,910
We need to get...

1855
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:07,570
What does it say?

1856
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,910
What does it say?

1857
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,730
Someone was like, we have to do the robots.

1858
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,010
What does it... go to red area?

1859
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:14,730
Here?

1860
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:17,330
Is this not the red?

1861
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:19,350
Oh, go to red area on the other side!

1862
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:20,230
Oh!

1863
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:22,410
Okay, defend.

1864
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:25,870
Oh, is it here?

1865
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:28,990
Okay, 44%.

1866
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,390
These are all liberated.

1867
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:33,810
Go to...

1868
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:35,530
The creek.

1869
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:36,910
Where the fuck is the creek?

1870
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,110
Oh, here!

1871
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:39,830
Alright, I'm at the creek.

1872
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:42,210
Where do I go?

1873
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,170
Okay, these guys.

1874
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:44,230
Maybe don't...

1875
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:45,050
Okay, they're level 2.

1876
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,990
Level 18!

1877
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:47,990
Okay, level 12.

1878
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:49,050
Level 4.

1879
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:50,330
Level 5.

1880
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:51,690
Level 20.

1881
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:54,670
What the fuck is this guy doing at level 20?

1882
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,070
Level 2.

1883
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:57,670
Yeah, we're not hanging out with the babies.

1884
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:59,910
We're not hanging out...

1885
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,470
Wait!

1886
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:04,970
Okay, parent launch.

1887
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:06,750
Wait, am I gonna regret it?

1888
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:08,070
Wait, what do you mean?

1889
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:11,830
I was there for the battle of the creek.

1890
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,130
Okay, we be...

1891
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:15,890
Okay, wait.

Level... Okay, I'll go here.

1893
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:18,430
No!

1894
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:20,670
No!

1895
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,370
I need... I need the...

1896
01:22:25,370 --> 01:22:26,770
Oh my god, there's a level 23 baby!

1897
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:28,010
Okay, no!

1898
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:28,890
Let me in!

1899
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:34,510
Let me in!

1900
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,930
I need somebody to... Oh my god, he's level 29!

1901
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,430
Let me in!

1902
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:41,790
Let me in!

1903
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:43,410
Babysit... No!

1904
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,590
Please!

1905
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:52,350
Please, I need somebody to babysit me!

1906
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:53,370
Please!

1907
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,450
Please, that's all... What the fuck?

1908
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:01,170
That's all I asked for.

1909
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:03,050
Let me in.

1910
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:05,190
Let me in!

1911
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,250
Level 15.

1912
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:08,910
Okay.

1913
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:11,950
Level 14 and level... Okay, we'll do...

1914
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:12,470
No!

1915
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:13,810
Fine.

1916
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:14,630
Fine.

1917
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:16,870
I'll do quick play.

1918
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:25,190
But if I pick random, I might be in the baby squad!

1919
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,610
And I want to be the only baby!

1920
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,010
Evil, thank you for the super chat.

1921
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:32,930
Thank you, thank you!

1922
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:37,090
You can throw supply drop orbital strike markers on your friends.

1923
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,210
Do what you will.

1924
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:39,430
Oh my god, level 25!

1925
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:42,730
Hey guys.

1926
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:45,190
Level 50?

1927
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:48,250
Whoa!

1928
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,190
Hello there.

1929
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:51,330
Oh, hey!

1930
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:53,970
Helldivers to help pods.

1931
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,510
Repeat, Helldivers to help pods.

1932
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,030
There's a level 50?

1933
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:59,950
How long you been playing this game?

1934
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,610
Anyways, you're here to fight the robots, aren't you?

1935
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,090
Hell yeah.

1936
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:05,210
Hell yeah.

1937
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:07,330
Hell yeah!

1938
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:09,290
Yeah, I'm... alright.

1939
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:11,950
I don't think he's confident.

1940
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:16,250
Mission preparation aborted.

1941
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,610
I've been watching your stream for a hot while now.

1942
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:19,710
Oh my god!

1943
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:22,030
Tell pods, go!

1944
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:23,270
What?

1945
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:23,770
What?

1946
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:27,850
Once you're ready, just help them to help out a pod.

1947
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:28,310
Whatever.

1948
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:29,730
Yeah!

1949
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:31,490
Wait, how do I do this?

1950
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,390
Wait, how do I do this?

1951
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:33,750
Oh, here you go.

1952
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,350
There you go.

1953
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:39,390
Where the fuck was your level 50?

1954
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:41,030
They exist?

1955
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:43,710
Just like...

1956
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,810
They...

1957
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,050
They exist?

1958
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,100
Oh my god, look at him!

1959
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:55,360
Look at his gear!

1960
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,480
Shush, look at this guy.

1961
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,660
Oh my god.

1962
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,100
Bro, how the fuck do you get to the level...

1963
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,420
This game came out like...

1964
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:07,840
You know what?

1965
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:08,380
That's okay.

1966
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:09,600
How...

1967
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,540
Well paid a babysit.

1968
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:11,980
Lazy.

1969
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,300
Thank you for the super chat.

1970
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:13,720
Thank you.

1971
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,280
Thank you.

1972
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,780
Bro, he actually got the drip!

1973
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,020
Bro!

1974
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,900
Help pod launch initiated.

1975
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,820
Hell drivers to help pod.

1976
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:24,620
It's not uncommon.

1977
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:28,860
How do you get in the server long enough to be level 50?

1978
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,120
Sigma male grind set.

1979
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,060
You're not... I'm not losing today, boys!

1980
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:42,320
You guys were like, oh no, Doki's so fucked.

1981
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:48,440
Like, oh no.

1982
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:54,860
If everybody thinks that's the point of fighting the bugs, just learn how to take cover.

1983
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,780
Learn how to take cover?

1984
01:25:59,360 --> 01:25:59,840
Learn how to take cover?

1985
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,320
Guys...

1986
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,280
I don't know... I don't think I'm that type of person.

1987
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,420
Okay.

1988
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,500
Oh my god.

1989
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:11,680
There's so many...

1990
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,220
There's so many...

1991
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:13,560
I have a gun.

1992
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,280
Okay.

1993
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,800
Wait, I'm wearing a shotgun.

1994
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:19,640
What am I doing?

1995
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,120
I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my gun.

1996
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,480
Okay.

1997
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,380
Don't worry, guys.

1998
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:24,840
You guys...

1999
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,080
But yeah, the robots...

2000
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:27,840
Alright.

2001
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:28,600
Alright.

2002
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:29,720
Don't worry, guys.

2003
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:30,960
Cover me!

2004
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:32,280
I'm getting my machine gun!

2005
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:35,460
Don't worry!

2006
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:37,840
Alright.

2007
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:38,280
Nice.

2008
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,480
I got my machine gun.

2009
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,180
Wait, can they shoot back?

2010
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,440
Wait, they can shoot back!

2011
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:44,960
Wooo!

2012
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,860
That's what I'm talking about.

2013
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,520
They can shoot back!

2014
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,200
Wait, that's fucked up.

2015
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,300
That's fucked up.

2016
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,600
I just saw some guy explode behind me.

2017
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:03,760
I've marked it on the map.

2018
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:04,660
They have guns.

2019
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:05,460
We'll be there.

2020
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:05,840
We'll be there.

2021
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:06,640
Where do we go?

2022
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:08,580
Right now.

2023
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:09,300
Where's S4?

2024
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:10,900
Surefour.

2025
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,900
S4, we'll follow you!

2026
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,760
I cannot stress how much of a fucking dragoon I am, donkey.

2027
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,960
I've been watching you for a fucking year.

2028
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:25,780
Oh shit, they're shooting!

2029
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,180
If you're a dragoon...

2030
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,360
If you die...

2031
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,020
If you die...

2032
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,620
If you let me die, you get kicked.

2033
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,120
A real dragoon wouldn't let me die.

2034
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:37,700
Oh god.

2035
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,280
Oh god.

2036
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:39,720
Oh god.

2037
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:41,740
There's so many things going on.

2038
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,340
Don't worry, we're fine.

2039
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,180
Wait, is that like a fucking Star Wars?

2040
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:48,440
They'll just fucking...

2041
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,580
They'll just drop it on us.

2042
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,180
This thing...

2043
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,180
It'll shoot them all down.

2044
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:51,960
Oh shit.

2045
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:51,980
Oh shit.

2046
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:52,120
They're shooting.

2047
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,180
Is that like a fucking AT&T walker right there?

2048
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,740
Guys, don't mind if we just wait here to do a quick... a big quick stop.

2049
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,440
Defend or kick.

2050
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:01,340
I can't speak fucking English.

2051
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:05,880
Defend or kick!

2052
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:07,500
Right now!

2053
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,320
Also, hello, Doughkeeper and public squad Discord.

2054
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:15,020
I know you're making fun of me right now.

2055
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,040
What the fuck?

2056
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:17,620
Bro.

2057
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:22,660
Bro.

2058
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:27,240
Wait, are you also a fucking dragoon?

2059
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,740
How the fuck did all of you snipe me?

2060
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,400
How the fuck?

2061
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:39,320
Oh my god, even the level 50 is a dragoon!

2062
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,580
I learned it quickly!

2063
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,720
Am I that easy to snipe?

2064
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,840
Am I actually that easy to snipe?

2065
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:47,980
I'm not.

2066
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,780
I'm not.

2067
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,520
I'm not.

2068
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:50,760
I'm not.

2069
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:51,440
I'm not.

2070
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,560
Oh shit.

2071
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,280
That's right, guys.

2072
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,760
I ain't losing any time soon!

2073
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,020
I don't know where I'm going.

2074
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,960
I don't... I don't... I don't know where I'm going.

2075
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:02,780
I got the side effect.

2076
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,080
You guys can go for like the younger... the younger...

2077
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:05,380
Okay.

2078
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,380
S4, go do the thing.

2079
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,760
We are everywhere.

2080
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:15,400
90% of the Helldiver server is just drag goons.

2081
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,220
You guys really didn't want me in the server, did you?

2082
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:19,260
Hahaha.

2083
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:20,460
Hahaha.

2084
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,360
Alright, nice.

2085
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:25,040
We'll be fine.

2086
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,580
Do I even need to shoot my gun?

2087
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:31,460
The one guy that's not a dragoon is the one that's getting fucked over right now.

2088
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,820
We did it!

2089
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,580
Easiest mission of my fucking life.

2090
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:48,860
Easy... Ow!

2091
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,320
Wait!

2092
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,940
You can get on fire?

2093
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,520
I don't even know...

2094
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,440
Okay, here we go.

2095
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:55,840
We're good.

2096
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,260
We're good.

2097
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,700
I don't even have to stream open anymore.

2098
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:58,660
We're good.

2099
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,480
Ah!

2100
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:01,740
We're not good!

2101
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,080
We're not good!

2102
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:04,100
Tap for map!

2103
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:04,660
I

2104
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,270
mean S4!

2105
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:10,890
Where's S4?

2106
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:11,750
S4, lead us!

2107
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:13,210
S4, lead us!

2108
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:13,910
You're the highest level!

2109
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:15,210
Well, can't get in there.

2110
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:17,990
There's the main objective.

2111
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:19,750
So we gotta launch a nuke.

2112
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,490
S4, lead us!

2113
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:26,350
I'll never have to tap if I follow one person!

2114
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:28,490
S4...

2115
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,930
Oh my god, this is so easy.

2116
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:40,530
I mean, this is...

2117
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:42,750
This is so... Oh my god!

2118
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:44,790
This is so easy.

2119
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:49,890
Uh... Oh, there's the coach.

2120
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:52,830
Look, I didn't think I'd... I didn't think I'd get shot!

2121
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:54,170
Don't be so...

2122
01:30:54,170 --> 01:31:01,310
You're gonna wanna collect as many of those samples as possible, cause that's what you want to upgrade your ship in order to get buffed for your strategies and such.

2123
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:05,410
Why do I have to pick it up if you guys can pick it up for me?

2124
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:10,710
Wait, it's like... Okay, what the samples mean, chat, what the samples mean, I have to pick it up myself?

2125
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:12,910
He's teaching us!

2126
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:15,510
Free lesson!

2127
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:17,310
Free lesson!

2128
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:23,890
We're dragoons, our legion.

2129
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:26,570
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, Zach.

2130
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,930
Okay, wait, it's shared?

2131
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:33,710
It's in... Okay, I like how, like, the... It's shared and it's individual are both, like, right next to each other.

2132
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:34,370
I...

2133
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:40,190
I liked how... I liked how that's next to each other.

2134
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:42,410
So it's like, what is it?

2135
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:46,310
Oh, nice.

2136
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:51,390
I'm getting so many lessons on this server alone.

2137
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:53,830
It's all shared.

2138
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:55,570
Start pulling up these boxes over here.

2139
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:56,670
Everyone gets at the end?

2140
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,950
Oh, so I don't have to do anything!

2141
01:31:58,830 --> 01:32:00,790
Oh, wait, let me shoot this one guy.

2142
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:01,970
Nice.

2143
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:03,790
Interact.

2144
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:04,470
I'm doing it!

2145
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:05,470
I'm doing my part!

2146
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,170
I'm doing my part!

2147
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,170
I got a supply by the terminal if you need ammo.

2148
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:13,550
I did it!

2149
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,530
Open the silo!

2150
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,770
Open the silo!

2151
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:17,850
Good.

2152
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:21,960
Good.

2153
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:23,440
I hate the creek.

2154
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,820
I love the... What do you mean?

2155
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:28,160
This is the fucking easiest game of my fucking life.

2156
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:29,500
I don't... No!

2157
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:30,020
T2!

2158
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:31,160
Oh, why does this look like a...

2159
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:38,970
The babies!

2160
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:40,410
Oh, hey, I'm back.

2161
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:41,650
It's like I never died.

2162
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:43,110
I got to fucking do it, okay?

2163
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:44,410
Where is he?

2164
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:44,670
Alright.

2165
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:46,030
We gotta kill this guy now.

2166
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:48,170
Don't... No res!

2167
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:49,310
Do not res him!

2168
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:51,010
Do not res this man!

2169
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:52,630
I'm gonna steal his gun.

2170
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:56,290
We don't res him!

2171
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:57,490
This is my gun now.

2172
01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:58,430
Where is he?

2173
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:00,150
If you res him, I'm just killing him again.

2174
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:02,710
I'm gonna kill him again.

2175
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:03,730
Where is he?

2176
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:05,310
Point me to the enemy.

2177
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:06,730
Where is he?

2178
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,750
We don't res him.

2179
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:10,690
We don't res him.

2180
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:11,750
He doesn't come back.

2181
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:12,590
But hey!

2182
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:15,210
He doesn't come back.

2183
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:15,790
Congratulations.

2184
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,770
S4, I swear to God.

2185
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,550
S4, I swear to God.

2186
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:25,170
We don't bring him back.

2187
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:27,650
We don't bring him back.

2188
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:30,090
I saw him sitting here in heaven, lost in the river or something.

2189
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:32,630
The dead don't talk!

2190
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:34,850
No.

2191
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:36,830
The dead don't talk!

2192
01:33:40,350 --> 01:33:41,550
Wait, he's back!

2193
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:42,310
Where is he?

2194
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:43,590
Where is he?

2195
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:52,530
The dead don't talk!

2196
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:59,690
That's how you're right.

2197
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:02,110
S4, you know what's good for you.

2198
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:07,610
There we go.

2199
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:14,970
Oh, it's so unlucky that there was some friendly fire there.

2200
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:17,590
That was so unlucky.

2201
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:18,490
No!

2202
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:19,890
Oh, fuck!

2203
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:20,970
Wait, we might lose this!

2204
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:23,310
S4, we might lose this!

2205
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:23,790
Oh, wait, we don't.

2206
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:24,150
We win.

2207
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,790
We win.

2208
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:25,570
Okay, nice.

2209
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:26,850
Nice.

2210
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:27,610
We did it.

2211
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:29,330
We're doing it!

2212
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:35,750
We don't need to bring them back.

2213
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:37,590
S4 and I, we're getting them back.

2214
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:38,130
We're gamers!

2215
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:40,870
Doki never forgets.

2216
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:43,050
Doki never forgets.

2217
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:48,670
Alright, here we go.

2218
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:50,630
We're good.

2219
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:52,130
What do you mean?

2220
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:54,810
Wait, he struck first!

2221
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:56,850
I was just...

2222
01:34:56,850 --> 01:34:58,870
Look, he hit me first!

2223
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:01,590
Guys, this was self-defense.

2224
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,770
This was self-defense, guys.

2225
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:06,890
Oh, no.

2226
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:08,410
Oh, no.

2227
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:12,170
This was self-defense, guys.

2228
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:15,470
I was all about self-defending.

2229
01:35:16,730 --> 01:35:18,670
It's okay, S4 can carry us.

2230
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:22,750
He ran in front of them, though.

2231
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:28,150
Self-defense three times?

2232
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:28,910
Yeah!

2233
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:30,850
What are you trying to say?

2234
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:31,290
Huh?

2235
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:34,650
Nice.

2236
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:36,870
I missed it.

2237
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:37,930
What do you mean?

2238
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:39,790
What do you mean?

2239
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,710
S4, I swear to god, S4.

2240
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:51,910
Look at us go.

2241
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,410
We're gamers.

2242
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:55,590
We're gaming.

2243
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:01,470
Wait, we get more points if we bring him back?

2244
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:03,150
Oh, shit.

2245
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:03,510
Okay.

2246
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:04,590
We bring him back.

2247
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:06,590
I love points.

2248
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:07,820
Oh.

2249
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:13,470
Oh, shit!

2250
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:15,790
Oh, shit!

2251
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:18,610
Don't worry.

2252
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:20,110
No!

2253
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:21,250
Guys!

2254
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:22,590
Oh, fuck!

2255
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:28,330
Guys, it's okay!

2256
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:30,270
I'm coming back!

2257
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:31,790
Look at that!

2258
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,650
Team player!

2259
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:37,610
Oh, shit!

2260
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:38,430
Oh, shit!

2261
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:38,790
Oh, shit!

2262
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:40,310
Well, that's a good thing.

2263
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:43,670
It's a good thing I brought people back, guys.

2264
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:47,210
Ooh, let me pick this up and then let me pick this up.

2265
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:48,730
Okay.

2266
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,990
Oh, no, no, no!

2267
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:53,170
Don't stand in front of me!

2268
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,310
Don't stand in front of me!

2269
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:57,110
All right, we're good, we're good, we're good.

2270
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:58,490
We're good.

2271
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:00,990
What the?

2272
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:04,430
I told you guys I can be a team player.

2273
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:06,690
Whose gun is this?

2274
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:07,270
It's my gun.

2275
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:07,790
Oh, yeah, this is...

2276
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:09,970
Holy shit.

2277
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:11,170
Holy shit.

2278
01:37:11,230 --> 01:37:11,650
I need reload.

2279
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:13,630
I need reload!

2280
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:16,910
Oh, shit, he's not dead anymore.

2281
01:37:16,910 --> 01:37:17,090
Oh!

2282
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,180
All right.

2283
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,560
We did it.

2284
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:27,220
If you're a real dragoon, you get crushed by the ship.

2285
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:33,780
If you want to get unmuted right now, get crushed by the ship right now.

2286
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,000
I will only unmute if you get crushed by the ship.

2287
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:54,560
Wait, you lose those points?

2288
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,640
What do you mean?

2289
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,120
S4 was willing to do it.

2290
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,680
Die for me.

2291
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,760
He's a real...

2292
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:03,840
S4 was willing to do it.

2293
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,080
A real one.

2294
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,520
Liberty has seen you through.

2295
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,340
He's the real one.

2296
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:14,500
A true mad lad.

2297
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:16,300
He survived.

2298
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:18,200
A true mad lad.

2299
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,240
He survived.

2300
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:21,440
He survived.

2301
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:26,480
S4, you selfless soul.

2302
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,100
Loyal to the end.

2303
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:33,680
A true freedom.

2304
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:33,740
He survived.

2305
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:34,740
Freedom Enthusiast.

2306
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,560
Now we know...

2307
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,820
who's really there for freedom.

2308
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,240
Look at that!

2309
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,280
I still got five stars!

2310
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:50,900
I still got five stars after all the unfortunate accidents of self-defense.

2311
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:53,520
Nicholas, thank you for the super chat.

2312
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,000
Thank you.

2313
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:56,860
Look at that.

2314
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,480
Stay muted forever.

2315
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,080
Hey!

2316
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:05,060
I said get crushed by the ship if you want to get unmuted.

2317
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,960
I'm doing my part.

2318
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:09,460
Lofa, thank you for the super chat.

2319
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:09,880
Thank you.

2320
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,720
Still a second mission to do.

2321
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:18,020
This is... democracy?

2322
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,200
Hell yeah, brother!

2323
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:24,360
Look at us go.

2324
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,780
We're fucking gamers.

2325
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,620
Alright, where's my ship?

2326
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,740
Alright, see ya losers.

2327
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,200
Wait, we're done.

2328
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,320
Zachary, Sponger is truly the best of us.

2329
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:46,460
Thank you for the super chat.

2330
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:46,860
Thank you.

2331
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:47,300
Thank you.

2332
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,260
Can you leave the game real quick?

2333
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,020
I wanna play.

2334
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:53,280
Thank you for the super chat.

2335
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:53,760
Thank you.

2336
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,420
Thank you.

2337
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,040
I'm gonna go.

2338
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:56,760
I'm gonna go.

2339
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:57,000
Alright.

2340
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,780
Here we go.

2341
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:01,700
Thank you.

2342
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:03,260
I did my part.

2343
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,600
I'm doing so well, guys.

2344
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:08,360
Alright.

2345
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,160
Okay, the robots are scary.

2346
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,320
Not gonna lie.

2347
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:19,000
The robots are actually pretty scary.

2348
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:20,260
I don't know.

2349
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,020
I don't know if I wanna keep doing the robots.

2350
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:28,240
Yeah, back to the... back to the bugs.

2351
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:32,500
I feel like the bugs were definitely a lot safer.

2352
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:39,180
The robots were a little scary.

2353
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:42,020
That was... that was not cool.

2354
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,980
That was not cool at all.

2355
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:48,220
Alright, let's see.

2356
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:51,000
What are some levels 3?

2357
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:51,760
They're all babies.

2358
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:54,180
Where are all the adults?

2359
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:56,260
They're all like babies.

2360
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,180
They're not even tweens.

2361
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:00,140
Okay, doctor, bullet, and recovery FPS.

2362
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:01,140
Alright.

2363
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:05,840
I'll get babysat by like a teenage... a college student.

2364
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:19,200
All of those lost hell dabbers were clearly traitors to democracy who stood in the way of Emperor President Doki.

2365
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:20,220
Hey, guys.

2366
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,760
I'm here to... Oh my god, another super citizen!

2367
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:25,900
Hey, guys.

2368
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,220
I'm here to leech off your mission.

2369
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:40,130
I was here to leech it off.

2370
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:41,390
Alright, what is this?

2371
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:42,850
Clothes are bug holes.

2372
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:44,350
Hey, guys.

2373
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:47,950
I'm trying... I'm trying... guys, give me a sec.

2374
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:50,730
I'm trying to... I'm trying to get my machine gun.

2375
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:52,370
Oh.

2376
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:54,410
Nice.

2377
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:55,350
Oh!

2378
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:57,730
Don't worry.

2379
01:41:58,690 --> 01:41:59,630
I can do this.

2380
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:00,970
Boop.

2381
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:02,050
Boop.

2382
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:02,870
Boop.

2383
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,210
Go higher difficulty.

2384
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:07,910
It'll go well, I swear.

2385
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:10,030
Okay, guys.

2386
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:13,070
I have to get there first.

2387
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:14,830
Oh my god!

2388
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:16,490
He blew up my gun!

2389
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:20,250
I'm coming back.

2390
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:23,930
Hey, guys.

2391
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:26,570
Oh, shit.

2392
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:29,250
Guys, let me come up!

2393
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:31,970
I wanna be cool just like you guys!

2394
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:33,630
Ow.

2395
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:36,590
Guys!

2396
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:37,790
There you go.

2397
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:39,410
Hello.

2398
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:42,830
Are we supposed to... go somewhere?

2399
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:45,210
Oh, we did it.

2400
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:48,090
Oh my god, did I successfully leech off of you guys?

2401
01:42:55,290 --> 01:42:55,730
Sponger!

2402
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:56,950
Thank you for the super chat!

2403
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:57,310
Thank you!

2404
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,930
Thank you!

2405
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:02,850
Oh, my god!

2406
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:04,230
There's a level 50 chat!

2407
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:09,090
The one that actually fucking...

2408
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:11,870
got crushed by the ship for me!

2409
01:43:13,850 --> 01:43:15,410
We're not a cult, by the way.

2410
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:16,450
We could be a religion.

2411
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:18,430
For tax purposes.

2412
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:22,190
No!

2413
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:23,070
Shit!

2414
01:43:25,130 --> 01:43:25,810
Heal me.

2415
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:32,090
Yeah, that's S4...

2416
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:33,390
Where do we go?

2417
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:33,990
Oh, my god!

2418
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:35,170
It's Uber Eats?!

2419
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:40,130
He has... he has the Uber Eats pack!

2420
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:46,980
What's our church?

2421
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,120
I don't know, I haven't filled up the forms to be legally a church.

2422
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:54,450
Reload!

2423
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,830
Oh, my god!

2424
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:58,890
The Democracy Deliverer!

2425
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:01,530
We're...

2426
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:02,730
Nabi, thank you for the super chat.

2427
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:03,090
Thank you.

2428
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:03,630
Thank you.

2429
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:08,050
We're definitely... No, we're not because we're not registered yet.

2430
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:16,870
We're not... we're not registered yet to be a cult for tax purposes.

2431
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:22,410
Because even though you're a cult, you can still be... you still like register as a church.

2432
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:24,390
For...

2433
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:28,010
For like... for no taxes.

2434
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:37,890
So we can't be categorized as one yet.

2435
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:42,590
Oh, hell boy.

2436
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:43,310
Hell bomb.

2437
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:44,690
What's happening?

2438
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:47,270
How does she know this?

2439
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:49,410
Because YouTube is like...

2440
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:51,970
You can learn a lot from YouTube.

2441
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:58,970
Because there was a YouTube content creator that wanted to legally be a church for like a day.

2442
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:01,770
And then he like did all... like he was...

2443
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:03,190
All you need is like a...

2444
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:03,970
Place of worship.

2445
01:45:04,530 --> 01:45:07,250
You need like a place of worship and you have to like...

2446
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:08,470
Get like a church.

2447
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:11,290
And like you have to have like a sermon.

2448
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,220
Hey guys.

2449
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:18,520
I was a little stupid.

2450
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:27,720
Hey, thank you guys.

2451
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:30,620
I'm happy you guys let me leech off your mission.

2452
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,680
I'm happy you guys let me leech off your mission.

2453
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:35,820
Thanks everybody.

2454
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2455
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:39,560
Okay.

2456
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:42,580
Just a little bit.

2457
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:44,980
Guys, I lost my gun.

2458
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:46,120
I don't know where he went.

2459
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:47,820
I'm just gonna follow you.

2460
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:49,640
No.

2461
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,180
Wait, where is my things?

2462
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:53,020
Where did I die?

2463
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,720
I don't even...

2464
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,540
Where did I die?

2465
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:02,140
Yeah.

2466
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,380
Oh, there it is.

2467
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:03,700
What?

2468
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,480
If I die again?

2469
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:04,680
Yeah.

2470
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:04,960
Hello.

2471
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:07,840
There you go.

2472
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:08,540
I found it.

2473
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:10,120
Nice.

2474
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,520
Oh shit.

2475
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:13,160
Let me...

2476
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:13,880
Guys!

2477
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:15,780
I won't step in another mine!

2478
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:17,060
I swear to God!

2479
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:18,620
Don't worry!

2480
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:19,540
I'm here now!

2481
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,120
I'm here now!

2482
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:24,660
Do not worry!

2483
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,920
I feel bad because like...

2484
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,580
I literally just like...

2485
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,260
They didn't even want me here and I showed up.

2486
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,900
It was like, please...

2487
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,280
Take care of me.

2488
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:47,820
They might be like on a fucking E-date right now and I just came in the third wheel.

2489
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:48,960
Like...

2490
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:52,900
If you think about it.

2491
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:53,520
High five!

2492
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:55,180
Thank you for the five gifted ships!

2493
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:55,600
Thank you!

2494
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:56,200
Thank you!

2495
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:00,420
Please help.

2496
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:01,480
They're like...

2497
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,200
This is the child you never wanted.

2498
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:09,130
Date later.

2499
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:10,370
This is war!

2500
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:13,110
There is no time for E-dates!

2501
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:15,290
We're here to spread democracy!

2502
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:19,390
Nothing like a democracy date.

2503
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:20,450
Exactly!

2504
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:24,570
Oh, a laser cannon.

2505
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:25,250
Can I steal this?

2506
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:34,400
Alright.

2507
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,380
Where do we go?

2508
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,460
D1 and R2.

2509
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:41,980
Do you tell they are totally in a discord together right now?

2510
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:51,540
Hey guys.

2511
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,860
So like...

2512
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:54,600
How you guys doing?

2513
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:58,520
How is your E-date going right now?

2514
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:01,200
I'm sorry for like...

2515
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,020
Interrupting your couple time.

2516
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:05,340
Uh...

2517
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:08,700
And like...

2518
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:11,160
Dying in the middle of your date.

2519
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,320
So you're forced to revive me.

2520
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:14,620
I'm sorry.

2521
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,520
Democracy doesn't wait for callbacks.

2522
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:23,420
Leave them alone, Doki!

2523
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:24,380
What?

2524
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,120
I'm trying to have a conversation!

2525
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:30,600
LurkCrow says thank you for the super chat.

2526
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:30,980
Thank you.

2527
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:31,500
Thank you.

2528
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:36,140
They gotta spread enough democracy to earn the freedom to date on this planet.

2529
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:39,080
If you take over leadership, I'm gonna go AFK for four minutes.

2530
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:49,680
Bro!

2531
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:00,100
Shit!

2532
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:03,260
I have a third wheel!

2533
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:03,980
Bro!

2534
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,220
Guys... alright.

2535
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:10,500
Well...

2536
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:13,380
Here we go.

2537
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,040
I can't believe it.

2538
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:24,640
I can't believe I was the third wheel this entire time!

2539
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:27,280
I was a joke!

2540
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:29,800
You ruined the freedom date!

2541
01:49:34,450 --> 01:49:37,140
We need you to come back from your toilet break!

2542
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:40,080
He can't lead us!

2543
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:44,560
Oh my god.

2544
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:48,880
Oh my god.

2545
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:49,460
Axeman!

2546
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:50,800
Thank you for the super chat!

2547
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,260
Thank you!

2548
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:51,780
Thank you!

2549
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,400
Hi Doki!

2550
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,860
I was the traitor who killed you!

2551
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:57,380
Have fun spreading managed democracy into the galaxy!

2552
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,380
Don't worry.

2553
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,240
I'm already ruining the date right now.

2554
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:03,460
Everything's going great.

2555
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:07,860
It's everything I've always wanted.

2556
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:12,020
Stop crying in the bathtub.

2557
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:12,340
Stop.

2558
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:18,500
Here we go.

2559
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:20,880
Can we do this?

2560
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:25,360
I can't believe it.

2561
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:28,860
He even like gave leadership... to his date.

2562
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:29,920
What's this?

2563
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:31,660
The screen is frozen.

2564
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:35,900
Oh shit, there's babies.

2565
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:40,440
I like... how is he like able to just AFK?

2566
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,320
Get out of the corner!

2567
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,420
Alright, you know what?

2568
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:46,920
Fuck this.

2569
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:48,040
I'm just gonna... bye.

2570
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:51,480
I'm just gonna... kill these guys.

2571
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:56,500
No one close to us, right?

2572
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:58,480
Nice.

2573
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:58,920
We're fine.

2574
01:50:58,980 --> 01:50:59,300
We're fine.

2575
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:02,180
Oh.

2576
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:04,040
Get out!

2577
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:04,420
Get out!

2578
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:05,560
Your laser is too slow!

2579
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,640
I'm just gonna...

2580
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:10,240
I should kill him before.

2581
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:11,320
Please!

2582
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,840
Come back from your toilet break!

2583
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,680
Come back from your toilet break!

2584
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:22,340
Fine!

2585
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:23,740
I'll heal myself!

2586
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:25,320
Fine!

2587
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:28,200
Mission at 30 minutes remaining.

2588
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:29,860
Activate terminal?

2589
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,500
Are we activated yet?

2590
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,600
Did you do it?

2591
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:34,120
You're the leader.

2592
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,000
Did you do it?

2593
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:41,140
Crying on the toilet from getting third wheeled.

2594
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:42,320
Did you do it?

2595
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:42,900
You're the leader!

2596
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,140
I don't know what to do!

2597
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,320
Think I know what to do!

2598
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:51,380
I don't know what to do!

2599
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:51,420
Look!

2600
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,700
He assigned you to be the leader!

2601
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:56,740
Literally useless!

2602
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,600
Look!

2603
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:59,940
He assigned him to be the leader!

2604
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,000
I'm just here to shoot my gun!

2605
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:03,320
I'm just a leecher!

2606
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,560
It's their day!

2607
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,700
I'm just freeloading!

2608
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:23,280
Are you doing it?

2609
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:25,020
Are you doing it R2?

2610
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:25,860
We did it!

2611
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:27,480
I'm on the terminal.

2612
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:29,480
Oh my god!

2613
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:29,900
He's back!

2614
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,220
He's back from his bathroom break!

2615
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,340
Look at him go!

2616
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,660
You need to help.

2617
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:43,300
I am just here to shoot my...

2618
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:43,720
Oh my god!

2619
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,520
He's doing it!

2620
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:46,120
Look at him!

2621
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:47,220
Think it worked!

2622
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,520
I bet like R2 was literally like screaming.

2623
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:54,600
Was like screaming to his like duo and be like...

2624
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:55,600
Oh my god!

2625
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:58,500
She is not even fucking aligning anything!

2626
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,840
She's literally just standing there!

2627
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:11,100
He just watched me like not do anything.

2628
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:16,040
I didn't know I was supposed to do this!

2629
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:19,640
I was not given any instructions.

2630
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:26,540
Look if there was no instructions given to me I don't know what to do.

2631
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,700
I just shoot guns.

2632
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:34,660
I was just waiting for D1 to come back.

2633
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,820
Just standing there.

2634
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:52,390
I bet you like normally people would just do like quick play and I'm just like freeloading other people's games.

2635
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:56,690
I bet you like normally people would just do like quick play and I'm just like freeloading other people's games.

2636
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:58,610
Shouldn't have made your lobbies public!

2637
01:54:01,230 --> 01:54:02,010
That's on you!

2638
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:09,650
If you didn't make your lobbies public I wouldn't be here!

2639
01:54:11,590 --> 01:54:14,150
Yeah, this is basically Starship Troopers.

2640
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:16,610
God, it's so toxic.

2641
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:19,370
What did we do?

2642
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:20,790
Did we activate our stuff?

2643
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:26,430
I'm cold, apparently.

2644
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:27,610
Extreme cold.

2645
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:34,390
You need to help so they can enjoy their date.

2646
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:35,970
I am helping!

2647
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:42,250
I'm giving them like... the true experience of freedom.

2648
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:43,830
I'm giving them the freedom experience!

2649
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:47,210
Public is freedom.

2650
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:54,110
If they really didn't want me to interrupt their date, they would have made this a private lobby.

2651
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:06,510
Objective, guys?

2652
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:12,110
Guys, I know this is like a beautiful scenery to enjoy with your significant other.

2653
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:14,030
But guys, come on.

2654
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:17,490
I'll be here for a very long time if we don't complete the objective.

2655
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:26,910
If you want me to leave, we gotta finish this objective, guys.

2656
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:29,930
That's fucking right.

2657
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:34,430
Check your map.

2658
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:38,390
I did!

2659
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:42,250
And I knew the objective was over there, but I wanted them to fucking...

2660
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:45,890
I love... I really love the Uber Eats ability.

2661
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:49,610
The hostage situation.

2662
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:57,460
Watch them kick you before...

2663
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:58,260
What do you mean?

2664
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:00,160
I was... I'm contributing.

2665
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:01,040
I'm doing my part.

2666
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:07,020
I hope they used your church for the wedding.

2667
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:09,120
Blue, thank you for the super chat.

2668
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:09,980
Thank you, thank you.

2669
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:17,680
They want you to watch their weird life.

2670
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,380
Oh my god, it makes sense.

2671
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:22,780
That's why their lobbies were public.

2672
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:26,140
Oh my god, it makes sense now.

2673
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:29,280
I was... they're freaks.

2674
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:30,820
I was their plus one.

2675
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,780
Oh yeah, there it is.

2676
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:40,580
Nice.

2677
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,260
Oh no, not another bug breach.

2678
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:44,180
Is it just that way?

2679
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:46,620
Okay, it's just over there.

2680
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:47,540
It's not that many.

2681
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:49,660
Which is good.

2682
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,640
Oh wait, the nuke's coming.

2683
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:52,500
The nuke's coming!

2684
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:55,280
Just keep going!

2685
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:56,020
Just keep running!

2686
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:58,500
Oh, there's some bugs in front of us!

2687
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:02,640
We're fine.

2688
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:07,310
Yeah!

2689
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:08,190
Freedom!

2690
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:09,730
Liberty!

2691
01:57:13,330 --> 01:57:14,270
Alright, let's go.

2692
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:14,950
I'm going back there.

2693
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:16,070
I'm gonna go loot.

2694
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:18,270
Is there no loot here?

2695
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:19,890
Why is there so much light?

2696
01:57:22,930 --> 01:57:25,270
How can there be so much light if there's no loot?

2697
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:25,490
Dude!

2698
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:29,170
Okay, we're... it's like... up top.

2699
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:30,350
See, look at that.

2700
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:31,090
I looked at my...

2701
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:33,050
I looked at my map, guys.

2702
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:36,930
Look at that.

2703
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:40,350
I looked at my fucking map for us.

2704
01:57:41,150 --> 01:57:42,670
Can I climb up?

2705
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:43,170
No?

2706
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:45,210
No?

2707
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:47,470
At least I can horse this.

2708
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:49,250
I can horse this.

2709
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:51,450
You can horse this!

2710
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:53,510
It's possible!

2711
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:54,550
No!

2712
01:57:54,550 --> 01:57:56,910
I can horse... I can horse this!

2713
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:59,390
I told you it was possible.

2714
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:01,950
I knew it was.

2715
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:08,670
I knew it was Skyrim horseable.

2716
01:58:13,450 --> 01:58:13,990
Nice.

2717
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:14,490
Oh, interact.

2718
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:16,230
I'm gonna grab some ammo.

2719
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:17,290
This?

2720
01:58:18,850 --> 01:58:19,770
I'm gonna do it.

2721
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:22,330
I'm gonna do it.

2722
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:24,530
Did I do it?

2723
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:28,510
It just works.

2724
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:29,990
I'm on the tunnel.

2725
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:31,150
Oh.

2726
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:34,410
There you go.

2727
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:35,550
I did it, guys.

2728
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:36,990
Huh?

2729
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:39,650
Huh?

2730
01:58:44,930 --> 01:58:45,530
Guys.

2731
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:48,590
Guys, someone else needs to do this.

2732
01:58:48,890 --> 01:58:49,250
Hahaha!

2733
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:51,390
Hahaha!

2734
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:53,090
Hahaha!

2735
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:53,790
Hahaha!

2736
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:53,850
Hahaha!

2737
01:58:55,610 --> 01:58:56,130
Hahaha!

2738
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,010
The leader!

2739
01:58:58,610 --> 01:59:00,070
Leader, do it, leader!

2740
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:01,270
Hahaha!

2741
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:02,190
Hahaha!

2742
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:03,330
Hahaha!

2743
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:05,970
Do it, leader!

2744
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:07,150
Hahaha!

2745
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:09,630
Wait, I don't think the...

2746
01:59:09,630 --> 01:59:10,990
I think the leader is struggling too.

2747
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:13,210
We can watch him struggle together, guys.

2748
01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:14,930
Oh my god, he did it!

2749
01:59:15,710 --> 01:59:16,230
Alright.

2750
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:20,070
Manually adjust flow rate values.

2751
01:59:20,670 --> 01:59:21,730
Are you doing it?

2752
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:23,810
Okay.

2753
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:24,990
Oh my god, D1.

2754
01:59:25,330 --> 01:59:26,730
Go do your job!

2755
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:28,670
It didn't even take one.

2756
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:29,950
Hahaha!

2757
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:35,740
He's a genius!

2758
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:39,160
He's so smart!

2759
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:45,240
Oh my god, he's going to the other valve now!

2760
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:46,660
Hahaha!

2761
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:48,620
Hahaha!

2762
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:00,270
Oh shit, I need a help.

2763
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:02,030
I need to help him.

2764
02:00:02,190 --> 02:00:02,410
I need to help him.

2765
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:06,150
Don't worry.

2766
02:00:07,110 --> 02:00:07,670
I'm going to let the leader do it.

2767
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:09,030
I know what my job is.

2768
02:00:09,730 --> 02:00:10,290
Hahaha!

2769
02:00:11,230 --> 02:00:12,870
And it's not useless!

2770
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:14,630
I'm not useless, guys!

2771
02:00:14,670 --> 02:00:15,170
I swear!

2772
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:17,310
I'm shooting my gun.

2773
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:18,390
Ah!

2774
02:00:20,670 --> 02:00:23,710
I can't be useless if I'm shooting my gun, guys.

2775
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:25,770
Hahaha!

2776
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:29,710
If you think about it...

2777
02:00:29,710 --> 02:00:30,730
Good job guys, thank you.

2778
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:31,390
Hahaha!

2779
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:37,310
It sounded so condescending.

2780
02:00:39,910 --> 02:00:42,890
It sounded so condescending.

2781
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:45,930
It actually did sound condescending.

2782
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:53,890
Good job guys.

2783
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,440
What did you expect?

2784
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:03,400
What do you mean?

2785
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:16,620
If I give us the loot, then he'll know I'm trying my best.

2786
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:27,420
I did it.

2787
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:34,950
Your job is standing there and being like, did you do it?

2788
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:36,430
That's my job.

2789
02:01:37,790 --> 02:01:38,570
It's this way.

2790
02:01:40,290 --> 02:01:41,910
Okay, I know where to go guys.

2791
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:44,110
Guys, I know where to go.

2792
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:46,670
Is it this way?

2793
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:53,390
Doki say thank you to your babysitter.

2794
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:58,590
Guys, we're a team.

2795
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:02,270
Just remember that before you do anything.

2796
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:04,490
We're a team.

2797
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:09,850
Wait, what are they doing?

2798
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:12,790
They don't want to do the extraction?

2799
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:17,670
What are they doing?

2800
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:19,910
Are they writing an angry letter to my manager?

2801
02:02:25,890 --> 02:02:28,550
Are they trying to vote kick me?

2802
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:29,210
Right now?

2803
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:38,790
Are they trying to vote kick me before we leave?

2804
02:02:39,450 --> 02:02:40,490
Please no.

2805
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:42,570
I'll give you guys supplies.

2806
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:45,250
Do you guys like supplies?

2807
02:02:51,470 --> 02:02:53,090
Oh wait, whoops.

2808
02:02:53,230 --> 02:02:54,890
I'll give you guys supplies guys.

2809
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:56,490
Look.

2810
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:58,690
Boop.

2811
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:03,970
I don't have ammo.

2812
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:06,950
I can't even do my one job.

2813
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:12,880
Nice.

2814
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:15,080
Look, see?

2815
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:17,020
I gave him supplies.

2816
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,840
He can't be mad at me anymore.

2817
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:28,220
Officer, that's her over there.

2818
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,780
Alright, here we go.

2819
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:31,280
We're coming over.

2820
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:33,380
I'm useful.

2821
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:35,740
What are they doing?

2822
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:36,740
Are they doing the side objective?

2823
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:40,380
You're in the marriage.

2824
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:44,080
If they can take care of me, they can have a child.

2825
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:46,700
I'm the child test.

2826
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:51,140
It's like how like parents are like, oh, can we take care of a...

2827
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:52,540
Should we have a kid?

2828
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:55,100
And then they were like, no, we have to...

2829
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:56,980
We have to make sure we...

2830
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:58,060
Let's get a dog first.

2831
02:03:58,260 --> 02:03:59,780
So we know if it's possible.

2832
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:00,700
You know, I'm that.

2833
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:01,260
I'm the dog.

2834
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:03,980
I'm the dog test.

2835
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,160
Like the egg test.

2836
02:04:11,340 --> 02:04:11,520
Yeah.

2837
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:15,520
But like instead, I'm the dog test, which is even better.

2838
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:22,470
If they can take care of me, they can handle a child.

2839
02:04:28,230 --> 02:04:29,950
What side quest are they trying to do?

2840
02:04:30,990 --> 02:04:31,630
How can...

2841
02:04:31,630 --> 02:04:31,830
Whoa!

2842
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,270
Oh shit.

2843
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:34,770
Oh shit.

2844
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:35,310
No, I'm poisoned.

2845
02:04:35,490 --> 02:04:36,010
Oh shit.

2846
02:04:36,770 --> 02:04:37,390
It's okay.

2847
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:37,790
I'm fine.

2848
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,570
I know you guys are so worried about me too.

2849
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:44,990
I know.

2850
02:04:46,030 --> 02:04:48,890
I know you guys are very worried about me, guys.

2851
02:04:58,190 --> 02:05:00,330
Now I can like fully reload this.

2852
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:03,790
Nice.

2853
02:05:04,570 --> 02:05:06,890
Guys, what side quest are you guys trying to do?

2854
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:09,910
The extraction point is like right next to us.

2855
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:13,530
Okay.

2856
02:05:16,270 --> 02:05:16,890
That's fine.

2857
02:05:16,970 --> 02:05:17,310
We're fine.

2858
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:17,710
We're fine.

2859
02:05:20,030 --> 02:05:20,990
Guys, the extract...

2860
02:05:20,990 --> 02:05:24,750
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but the extraction is available, guys.

2861
02:05:25,370 --> 02:05:30,170
I don't know if you guys know this, but the extraction is, is very available.

2862
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:32,790
Oh shit.

2863
02:05:32,890 --> 02:05:33,210
Okay.

2864
02:05:38,970 --> 02:05:39,370
Here we go.

2865
02:05:39,450 --> 02:05:39,730
Oh!

2866
02:05:39,730 --> 02:05:39,770
Oh!

2867
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:41,670
There we go.

2868
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:44,950
Guys!

2869
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:48,290
Guys!

2870
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:49,810
Are you guys done?

2871
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:51,590
Are you guys done?

2872
02:05:53,530 --> 02:05:54,210
Yeah!

2873
02:05:58,970 --> 02:06:01,090
He's gonna be on his way.

2874
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:01,990
Wait, me?

2875
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:05,110
Wait, which way is extraction?

2876
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:07,930
Wait, what?

2877
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:08,990
Guys!

2878
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:10,690
Wait!

2879
02:06:13,130 --> 02:06:14,310
It's like he knew!

2880
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:21,770
I already forgot which way was extraction.

2881
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:24,450
Who's fucking beating me up?

2882
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:28,460
Okay.

2883
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:30,500
It's like this way.

2884
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:32,620
Oh, it is.

2885
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:33,480
It's like this way.

2886
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:39,920
Bro!

2887
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:41,380
He knew!

2888
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:41,700
He knew!

2889
02:06:41,780 --> 02:06:43,840
Sorry guys, I bounced off the hill.

2890
02:06:56,750 --> 02:07:00,410
Sorry guys, I bounced off the hill.

2891
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:02,650
Thanks man.

2892
02:07:03,670 --> 02:07:04,430
Thanks.

2893
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:09,850
Look, he said sorry.

2894
02:07:10,190 --> 02:07:10,970
I guess.

2895
02:07:11,330 --> 02:07:12,190
I guess.

2896
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:14,770
Oh my god.

2897
02:07:14,770 --> 02:07:16,710
He failed the baby test.

2898
02:07:17,710 --> 02:07:18,230
Guys.

2899
02:07:20,690 --> 02:07:21,850
Guys, I don't know.

2900
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:23,930
He failed the baby test, guys.

2901
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:30,400
I tried to run!

2902
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:31,820
What do you mean?

2903
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:33,500
I swear to god!

2904
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:34,060
Oh god!

2905
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:34,760
Oh god!

2906
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:41,220
Guys, I think...

2907
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:42,100
I think he's done.

2908
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:45,360
I think he wants the state to be over.

2909
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:50,200
I don't know.

2910
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:51,020
I have a feeling.

2911
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:53,300
Oh shit!

2912
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:54,360
I killed 150 enemies!

2913
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:54,900
Let's go!

2914
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,960
I did what I've always wanted to do.

2915
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,140
Ruined somebody's date.

2916
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:07,160
He is done, baby.

2917
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:07,700
Sick.

2918
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:08,280
No!

2919
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:08,840
No!

2920
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:09,160
Stop!

2921
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:09,920
Stop poking me!

2922
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:11,680
Yeah.

2923
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:14,540
We're almost there.

2924
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:17,040
Extraction is so far.

2925
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:18,240
I don't know.

2926
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:20,600
The baby bounced off the hill.

2927
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:21,120
Nice.

2928
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,820
Well, thank you for the super chat.

2929
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:23,300
Thank you!

2930
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:23,920
Thank you.

2931
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,840
And then thank you for the super chat.

2932
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:26,200
Thank you.

2933
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:26,760
Thank you.

2934
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:28,560
Mom, Dad!

2935
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:30,380
I want to go home.

2936
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:34,060
Thank you for the super chat.

2937
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:34,500
Thank you.

2938
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,140
Thank you.

2939
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:38,120
I made them break up!

2940
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:38,840
Look.

2941
02:08:39,020 --> 02:08:44,220
If I was the one that broke their marriage, then maybe they were never compatible in the first place.

2942
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:44,960
Okay?

2943
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:47,740
I am not the main reason.

2944
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:49,580
Listen, I was the breaking point.

2945
02:08:54,690 --> 02:08:55,410
Wanna do it?

2946
02:09:00,530 --> 02:09:02,790
Yes, but also...

2947
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:07,950
I was like the one that pushed them off the edge.

2948
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:13,150
But it doesn't mean that I was the sole cause of this.

2949
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:19,690
Why do you sound proud of that?

2950
02:09:19,690 --> 02:09:21,870
I didn't say I was proud of it.

2951
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:22,650
I'm just saying.

2952
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:26,810
It's not my fault that they broke up.

2953
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:32,810
I was just there.

2954
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:38,610
Doki opening marriage counseling.

2955
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:40,150
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

2956
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:40,990
Thank you, thank you.

2957
02:09:41,330 --> 02:09:44,490
Uh, Tia, thank you for the 20 gift-a-shifts.

2958
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:45,410
Thank you, thank you.

2959
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:54,650
Alright, woah, WOAH!

2960
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:55,510
WOAH!

2961
02:09:55,530 --> 02:09:57,110
HE ALMOST KILLED YOUR WIFE!

2962
02:10:00,350 --> 02:10:01,850
Guys, this isn't good.

2963
02:10:02,090 --> 02:10:03,730
I don't think they're gonna last any longer.

2964
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:12,640
Oh my god, he actually almost nated him.

2965
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:15,500
He actually almost...

2966
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:23,160
Can you convince your teammates to turn off the game of trying to fight for freedom?

2967
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,740
Gator, thank you for the super chat.

2968
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,760
Thank you, thank you.

2969
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:28,280
It's all going wrong.

2970
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,700
It's all going wrong!

2971
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:37,660
Everything's going wrong right now!

2972
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:43,960
Okay.

2973
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:47,040
Oh no.

2974
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:49,040
It's okay, I have my shotgun.

2975
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:53,280
It's alright!

2976
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:56,640
We're fine!

2977
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:57,820
The ship's coming down!

2978
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:00,660
It's almost freedom hours!

2979
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:05,660
I just have my pistol!

2980
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:11,540
Alright, here we go.

2981
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,800
We're doing it, we're doing it.

2982
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:17,580
Nice.

2983
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:18,240
Goodbye.

2984
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:23,320
Stoops, thank you for the super chat.

2985
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:24,020
Thank you, thank you!

2986
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:26,580
We

2987
02:11:35,530 --> 02:11:36,250
did it!

2988
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:37,330
For freedom!

2989
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:44,250
Yay!

2990
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:48,090
Guys, you know what?

2991
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:51,190
I think they'll make it in the end.

2992
02:11:57,510 --> 02:12:00,070
I feel like they're gonna make it.

2993
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:08,210
We did it, chat!

2994
02:12:08,650 --> 02:12:09,750
We did it!

2995
02:12:09,750 --> 02:12:10,370
Four stars?

2996
02:12:10,930 --> 02:12:11,530
No!

2997
02:12:12,110 --> 02:12:13,430
I love it!

2998
02:12:13,570 --> 02:12:14,570
Only four stars.

2999
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:16,550
But why?

3000
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:18,610
We did so much!

3001
02:12:22,010 --> 02:12:23,730
Freedom from marriage.

3002
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,710
I don't understand!

3003
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:32,850
We couldn't get five because of...

3004
02:12:32,850 --> 02:12:33,350
Hey!

3005
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:34,190
Hey!

3006
02:12:34,770 --> 02:12:36,610
I don't know what you're talking about.

3007
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:42,910
I don't know what you're talking about.

3008
02:12:42,950 --> 02:12:43,790
I didn't do anything wrong.

3009
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:45,030
I didn't do anything.

3010
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:48,790
I can't do anything wrong if I didn't do anything.

3011
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:50,530
If you think about that.

3012
02:12:51,850 --> 02:12:52,930
No impact.

3013
02:12:59,170 --> 02:12:59,730
True.

3014
02:13:02,230 --> 02:13:03,370
Why can't I leave?

3015
02:13:03,630 --> 02:13:04,410
Oh, okay.

3016
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:06,050
I was just standing behind this man.

3017
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:07,350
Alright, see you guys.

3018
02:13:07,450 --> 02:13:08,550
Good luck with your marriage.

3019
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:19,240
I got hard!

3020
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:21,380
Difficulty.

3021
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,880
Because I realized that sounded weird out of context.

3022
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:30,180
Alright, I think this was a good time.

3023
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:31,260
I got...

3024
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:31,680
Wait.

3025
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:32,960
Oh, he has finger guns?

3026
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:34,320
Oh my god.

3027
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:36,200
Pearl still has Belle and the Beast.

3028
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:37,400
Now DNR.

3029
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:38,080
Chucho.

3030
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:39,240
Thank you for the super chat.

3031
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:39,680
Thank you.

3032
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:40,260
Thank you.

3033
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:41,380
Alright, guys.

3034
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:43,520
I think this is a good time to call it here.

3035
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:48,420
I think saving a marriage is a good way to end today's stream.

3036
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:57,420
I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

3037
02:13:58,500 --> 02:13:59,580
That's fun though.

3038
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:00,440
It's really fun.

3039
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:04,380
Just like encountering all these different people today.

3040
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:09,600
We encountered so many different people today.

3041
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:12,560
Man, I had a lot of fun.

3042
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,780
I hope you guys had fun watching too.

3043
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:16,380
Thank you everybody.

3044
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:17,680
Thank you guys.

3045
02:14:20,140 --> 02:14:21,100
That was...

3046
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:22,720
That was actually like...

3047
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,200
That was honestly like really, really fun.

3048
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:25,760
I'm really glad that I got to...

3049
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:28,840
I got to try out Helldivers.

3050
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:31,200
Alright, guys.

3051
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:32,160
You guys can...

3052
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:36,900
I gave you guys one spot in the Helldivers server.

3053
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:38,400
Good luck.

3054
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:47,640
Good luck to that one person that gets to fight for freedom.

3055
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:49,040
Good luck to you.

3056
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:50,540
Oh, yes!

3057
02:14:50,980 --> 02:14:52,280
For those who don't...

3058
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:54,220
Before I call it here.

3059
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,040
Tomorrow is gonna...

3060
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,160
I'll be streaming on Twitch.

3061
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:01,180
For the PAL World's Twitch Rivals.

3062
02:15:01,660 --> 02:15:04,600
And my team is going to be...

3063
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:11,800
Surefour, ShyLily, and this little indie slime called P.O.P.

3064
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:12,460
I think that...

3065
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:13,300
I don't really know...

3066
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:14,720
How to pronounce her name.

3067
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:18,240
But I saw that she won a PAL World competition.

3068
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:20,400
So I invited her to join us.

3069
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:23,400
So, yeah.

3070
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:26,200
So, I am very excited.

3071
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:27,860
To play...

3072
02:15:27,860 --> 02:15:28,940
To... I just...

3073
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:31,120
Honestly, I don't really care if we get last.

3074
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:33,760
Because what I love about Twitch Rivals...

3075
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:36,380
Is that no matter what placement you get...

3076
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:37,660
You get automatic money.

3077
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:44,800
It's just...

3078
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:45,740
No matter...

3079
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:46,420
You know...

3080
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:47,960
No matter what placement...

3081
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:50,240
We still win money in the end.

3082
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:51,480
And like last...

3083
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:53,000
For last place...

3084
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,820
You win like $500.

3085
02:15:55,660 --> 02:15:56,800
So I was like...

3086
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:57,220
What?

3087
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:58,640
I'm fine with that.

3088
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,360
I was just like...

3089
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,500
Money is money.

3090
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:09,260
It's...

3091
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:10,880
Yeah, it's pure profit.

3092
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:14,920
So like...

3093
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:15,740
I'm just here...

3094
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:16,640
I just want to have fun.

3095
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,640
I just want to have like fun...

3096
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:20,700
With people.

3097
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:21,400
Oh yeah.

3098
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:22,860
Shallow and I were actually supposed to...

3099
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,200
We were going to collab next week.

3100
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:25,140
So...

3101
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:26,900
We were going to collab next week.

3102
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:27,960
But then I asked her...

3103
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,140
Because I had like an extra spot.

3104
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:29,760
And I was like...

3105
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:31,200
Oh, do you want to join?

3106
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:32,420
Because like she actually was...

3107
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:34,500
Was originally trying to join...

3108
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:35,900
PAL World Twitch Rivals.

3109
02:16:36,060 --> 02:16:37,600
But like her team...

3110
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:38,460
Um...

3111
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:41,780
They couldn't get like a team together in time.

3112
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:42,500
Uh...

3113
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,100
Last minute.

3114
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:47,020
So then like she was actually supposed to do PAL World Twitch Rivals.

3115
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:51,640
But then like she had their team ended up like dropping out at the end because they couldn't find enough people.

3116
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,360
So I was like...

3117
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:53,160
Oh hey, I still have a spot.

3118
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:54,480
Do you want to join me?

3119
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:55,160
And she's like...

3120
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:55,280
Yeah.

3121
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:56,040
So I was like...

3122
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:56,500
Yeah, nice.

3123
02:16:58,600 --> 02:16:59,000
Um...

3124
02:16:59,000 --> 02:16:59,400
Uh...

3125
02:16:59,400 --> 02:16:59,960
So yeah.

3126
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:00,860
Um...

3127
02:17:00,860 --> 02:17:03,720
And I'm going to be having a collab with Shia Lili next week.

3128
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:06,460
I don't really know the details because we're still organizing it.

3129
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,280
But yeah.

3130
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:09,000
There's a lot of fun things.

3131
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,880
There's a lot of fun things that are coming up for uh...

3132
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:11,900
Next week too.

3133
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:12,640
Uh...

3134
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:13,000
So yeah.

3135
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:15,120
That is what's happening for tomorrow.

3136
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:16,380
It's a two day event.

3137
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:17,100
Uh...

3138
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:19,680
We don't know what the achievements are that we're supposed to get.

3139
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:24,180
They're going to give us like a list of achievements that we're supposed to uh...

3140
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:24,680
Like...

3141
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:25,860
Like fight for.

3142
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:26,540
Like...

3143
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:32,180
Like you know like whichever team has the most achievements by X amount of time basically wins uh...

3144
02:17:32,180 --> 02:17:33,840
Basically like uh...

3145
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:35,120
Wins or something.

3146
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:36,260
Get like ranked and stuff.

3147
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:37,140
Um...

3148
02:17:37,140 --> 02:17:38,980
So we're supposed to find out like 15 minutes of stuff.

3149
02:17:38,980 --> 02:17:39,360
But then we're going to have to figure out like an hour and a half of stuff.

3150
02:17:39,360 --> 02:17:42,140
We're going to have to do like an hour and a half or so before the tournament starts.

3151
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:44,540
And so those are the rules.

3152
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:46,580
But they're already people?

3153
02:17:46,980 --> 02:17:47,980
It's so funny.

3154
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,900
I was looking at the discord and I was like reading the rules and they're already people that were like can we...

3155
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:55,460
Like can we exploit?

3156
02:17:57,140 --> 02:18:02,000
Can we exploit and do like speedrun strats and stuff like that.

3157
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:04,720
And it was so funny because the staff was like...

3158
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,200
No.

3159
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:05,900
No.

3160
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:06,600
No.

3161
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:11,460
Because they were like, can we do this speedrun track?

3162
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:13,380
Can we do that speedrun track?

3163
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:14,800
Can we do this exploit?

3164
02:18:14,940 --> 02:18:18,440
And then Sam was just like, no, no, no, no, no!

3165
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:21,940
And I thought it was so funny, I was like, what the fuck?

3166
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:25,000
People are already training for this!

3167
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:27,720
And I was like, bro, it's just PAL World!

3168
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:35,620
Yeah, I was like, holy shit, this is like, this is so sweaty already!

3169
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:36,980
That is crazy!

3170
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:40,060
It's so competitive!

3171
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:43,200
I didn't realize how competitive it was gonna be!

3172
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:46,440
Because it's like, it's just like an achievement run.

3173
02:18:49,140 --> 02:18:57,060
But yeah, they're like fucking brainstorming like speedrun strats right now in the PAL World, like Twitch Rivals Discord.

3174
02:18:57,460 --> 02:18:59,220
I was just like, holy fuck!

3175
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:03,160
I just wanted to fuck around and have fun!

3176
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:13,880
But like, honestly, whatever placement we get, I just hope to have lots of fun!

3177
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:16,660
With old and new friends.

3178
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:17,900
Oh yeah!

3179
02:19:18,180 --> 02:19:24,380
Also like, I'm not sure when we're gonna be debut- like when it's gonna be up on the store!

3180
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:30,020
But we do have the Lunar New Year merch fully done.

3181
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:34,840
But it's not on the store yet, because we're still like setting some stuff up.

3182
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:36,960
Here's a little preview for that.

3183
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:42,460
So that's gonna be on the merch store.

3184
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:45,460
It's gonna be soon, because we're still setting stuff up.

3185
02:19:46,680 --> 02:19:55,200
But yeah, so there's gonna be an acrylic stand, some button badges, some stickers, the pillow, the red pocket envelopes.

3186
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:57,200
And then like, there's gonna be a limited bundle.

3187
02:19:57,480 --> 02:19:59,000
This is gonna be a limited set.

3188
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:02,420
Except for the red pocket envelopes.

3189
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:06,300
The button badges, stickers, acrylic stand, pillow is a limited run.

3190
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:06,960
But yeah, we're gonna be doing that.

3191
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:12,380
But the red pocket- because it's like themed around Year of the Dragon.

3192
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:15,560
So like, this is themed around Year of the Dragon and everything.

3193
02:20:16,100 --> 02:20:22,680
Red pocket envelopes aren't, but because it's themed around Year of the Dragon, it's gonna be a limited set for- Like, as in like a limited run.

3194
02:20:22,980 --> 02:20:27,500
Not just a set, but like, it'll be over- the pre-orders are gonna stop at a specific month.

3195
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:30,180
And then it's not gonna be brought back.

3196
02:20:30,300 --> 02:20:31,700
And it's not gonna be staying in the store forever.

3197
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,820
But the red pocket envelopes will stay in the store forever.

3198
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:40,900
Since I feel like- Since the red pocket envelopes isn't like specific to like the Year of the Dragon.

3199
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:42,120
Um...

3200
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:43,080
But yeah!

3201
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:45,320
