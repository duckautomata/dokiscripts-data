1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,460
I'm loud.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,040
Oh my gosh, I'm so loud.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,820
Hello, everybody.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,260
Hello.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,060
Can you guys hear me?

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,220
I don't know if I'm loud or not.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,960
I don't know.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,200
Hello?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,560
Hello?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,160
Okay, give me a sec.

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,180
Oh my god, to listen to BGM, but I don't want to listen to BGM.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,820
Hello?

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,200
Wait, I got an idea.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,060
Maybe if I... Okay, so I'm not forced to listen to BGM, but you are.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,240
Okay, hello.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,140
Okay, where's my chat?

18
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,700
Okay, here we go.

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,060
Oh, everything is so scuffed right now.

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,480
Everything is so scuffed.

21
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,480
I couldn't... I'm updating my phone to see if I can get my skin suit on.

22
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,080
But right now, I'm just a... There is no BGM.

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,020
There's no way.

24
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,880
There's no way.

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,660
I worked so hard sitting on it.

26
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,500
Is there actually no BGM?

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,320
Can you guys not hear this?

28
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,740
In the background?

29
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,360
Can you... Oh, is it crispy?

30
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,820
Moist.

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,800
Okay, I'll up the BGM.

32
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,320
Okay, SoundGat, you gotta Discord message me because...

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,500
Um... Because I can't see shit.

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,560
Oh, am I peeking the mic?

35
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,480
Oh, no.

36
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,980
Okay, let me tone it down a little.

37
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,140
Let me... I'm at the... If you guys didn't know... Hello?

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,680
Hello?

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,380
Yo, I am at the... Uh... Marvel Rivals studio right now.

40
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,880
So, like... Yeah, like...

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,480
I was here an hour early.

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,620
And I still couldn't fucking figure out how to set this up.

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,520
I...

44
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,480
I said...

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,520
I woke up at 6 in the morning.

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,180
I woke up at 6 in the morning.

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,860
Got breakfast.

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,280
Came over here.

49
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,620
And, um...

50
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,320
And, like, you know...

51
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,780
Like...

52
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,480
Just try to set up this PC.

53
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,640
Uh...

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,380
So, if any of my sound people...

55
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,540
I can't even tweet out that I'm live right now.

56
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,180
Um...

57
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,780
Because I'm trying to update my phone.

58
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,760
And I didn't log on to my Twitter on the PC.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,580
So, like...

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,540
I was like, oh, maybe my phone needs an update.

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,040
And that's why, like, my skin suit stuff don't work.

62
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:19,940
Um...

63
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,480
Because I have to connect via USB.

64
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,180
And it's like...

65
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,480
Okay, here's some technical...

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,660
Oh, am I peaking the mic really bad?

67
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,120
I'll put it farther away from me.

68
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,260
There you go.

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,920
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm...

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,600
I'm figuring stuff as we go along.

72
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,520
I...

73
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,680
The mic is...

74
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,420
Like, really far away from my face now.

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,660
Is that better?

76
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
Is it better?

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,480
No, you're...

78
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
Wait, where did I put my water?

79
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
Also, I got sick.

80
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,360
I literally got sick on the day I was gonna stream.

81
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,540
I was okay.

82
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,500
And then, uh...

83
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:56,760
Uh...

84
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,700
Oh, am I low now?

85
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,200
God, fucking okay.

86
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,060
Um...

87
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,200
I'll boost up myself.

88
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,760
But I put the mic away from me.

89
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,680
But, um...

90
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,340
Yeah, I'm...

91
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,960
Today...

92
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,240
The day I decided to stream, I got sick in the end.

93
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,580
I think it's because, like, I'm going through, like, hot and cold environments.

94
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,680
Like, it'll be, like, super hot outside.

95
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,420
For those who don't know!

96
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,060
Okay, I'll explain more.

97
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,180
As soon as you guys, like, tell me if everything sounds okay.

98
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,840
Um...

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,300
Let me know.

100
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
If you tell me...

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,000
Whenever my volume, my mic stuff is, like, okay.

102
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,280
Just let me know.

103
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,400
And then I'll tell the story.

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,440
Oh...

105
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,840
No, it's, like...

106
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,180
Super hot, humid environment.

107
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,000
And then I go into a super cold environment.

108
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
And then back and forth.

109
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,100
So, like, that's not very good for your body.

110
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,980
I don't know if you guys know that.

111
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,420
They even warned us, too.

112
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,720
They're, like, if you get, like, extra, like, super hot.

113
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,480
And then move into a super cold environment.

114
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,660
And do it, like, back and forth.

115
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,980
You're more likely to get sick.

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,760
Because your body is not good at, you know, adjusting to the different temperatures.

117
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,600
Um...

118
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,300
Uh...

119
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,640
Okay.

120
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,520
I don't know if any of my sound people are alive.

121
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,260
Because I don't...

122
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,760
I don't know.

123
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,420
I don't know.

124
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:16,920
Alright.

125
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,800
Are any of my mods alive?

126
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,720
Because I can't start the story until we figure this shit out, guys.

127
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,140
I can't start any of my stories.

128
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,780
Oh, okay.

129
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,180
Okay.

130
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,360
One of them was, like, I'm sort of here.

131
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm...

132
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,700
I don't know how much that's gonna help.

133
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,480
But they're sort of here.

134
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,440
You know?

135
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,960
I don't know.

136
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,500
Why am I also, like...

137
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:39,680
Yeah.

138
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,800
It's a lot.

139
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,860
Everything is...

140
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,900
I think I spent, like, an hour and 15 minutes just trying to fix my...

141
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,800
Like, trying to see if I can...

142
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,340
Um...

143
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,140
If I could, like, get my skin suit to work.

144
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,520
But I guess that...

145
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,500
I wasted an hour and 15 minutes of my life.

146
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,280
I...

147
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,300
I guess.

148
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,180
Okay.

149
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,440
Wait.

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,080
Let me see.

151
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,020
All right.

152
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,060
Let's see if this connects via USB.

153
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,440
All right.

154
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,500
Oh, well.

155
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,000
Never mind.

156
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,180
I have to download and update first.

157
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,020
Never mind.

158
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,260
For my...

159
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,000
For my VTube studios.

160
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,140
All right.

161
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,840
Oh, it's...

162
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,140
Oh, it's picking up Discord.

163
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,080
Bling.

164
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,800
Sorry.

165
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,700
If you guys are hearing notifications.

166
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,320
Um...

167
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,700
That was from my sound team.

168
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,660
They're like...

169
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:27,940
Bling.

170
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,660
Bling.

171
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,520
Wait.

172
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:31,900
Can I...

173
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,340
I need to set up streamer mode, too.

174
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:33,840
I guess.

175
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,340
Oh.

176
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,380
Where's streamer mode?

177
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,040
Oh.

178
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,160
It's not automatic?

179
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,700
Where's my streamer mode?

180
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,660
Not automatic.

181
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,340
Okay.

182
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,100
Streamer mode.

183
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,340
Oh.

184
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,540
I think it's, like...

185
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,760
Where was here last turn?

186
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,600
Not streamer mode.

187
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,780
That's why.

188
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,720
That makes sense.

189
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,600
Bling.

190
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,360
Bling.

191
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,700
All right.

192
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,100
Notifications are off.

193
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,680
You guys won't be tortured by the...

194
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,380
Um...

195
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,060
By the notifications now.

196
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,460
Um...

197
00:05:59,460 --> 00:05:59,880
All right.

198
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,380
I'm just waiting for them to tell me if everything's gonna be okay.

199
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,980
Don't worry, Toki.

200
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,360
Everything's gonna be okay.

201
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,700
Even though I...

202
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,040
I...

203
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,600
I don't feel like it.

204
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,580
But everything's gonna...

205
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,380
Be okay.

206
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,100
Hehehehehe.

207
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,160
All right.

208
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,320
Let's see if this works.

209
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,580
All right.

210
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,820
All right.

211
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,440
Connect to USB.

212
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,280
Come on.

213
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,060
Why don't you work?

214
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,580
Come on.

215
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,980
Work.

216
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,540
Oh my god.

217
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,920
I worked so hard.

218
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,780
Oh my god.

219
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,040
Okay.

220
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,220
Updating my phone was not it.

221
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,200
I thought updating my phone would fix it.

222
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,580
But it didn't fix anything.

223
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,820
All right.

224
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,900
Because they were like...

225
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,820
Oh, maybe it's because your phone isn't updated.

226
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,500
And maybe when you update your phone, it will be okay.

227
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,940
I was like, okay.

228
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,400
When was the last time I updated?

229
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,160
And I was like...

230
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,640
I had to delete stuff off my phone.

231
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,900
Because the update was too big.

232
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,700
So I had to like...

233
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,420
I had to like...

234
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,180
Delete like 10 gigabytes worth of stuff on my phone.

235
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,540
And to get to like my new iPhone update.

236
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,860
So I was like, okay, I did that.

237
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,700
I just deleted like 10 gigabytes of stuff.

238
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,080
Maybe then it will work.

239
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,420
Maybe then the world will be kind to me.

240
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,460
Um, but sadly that was a lie.

241
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,020
That...

242
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,300
Yeah, because my phone is like maxed out in...

243
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,260
Um, my phone has like...

244
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,120
Is maxed out in memory stuff.

245
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,060
Um, because I've been transferring my files since I first got an iPhone.

246
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,820
Which is the iPhone 1.

247
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,820
So, um...

248
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,860
I haven't deleted anything since then.

249
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,800
So I have like stuff from like...

250
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,140
I don't know.

251
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,840
Whenever the iPhone 1 first came out.

252
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,480
I still have stuff from that.

253
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Like on my phone.

254
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,580
And I've just been like transferring it.

255
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,620
Over and over.

256
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,240
Like just like the next generation.

257
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,080
Next generation.

258
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,780
Like over and over and over again.

259
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,200
Until like, you know.

260
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,140
Instead of like deleting anything.

261
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,060
I just...

262
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,600
I just buy a bigger...

263
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,020
I just buy more gigabytes.

264
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,040
You see.

265
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,440
When I first started.

266
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,360
It was like what?

267
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,740
8 gigabytes I think.

268
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,660
I think that was like the original.

269
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,560
It was 8 gigabytes.

270
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,540
And then, you know.

271
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,980
After that they made 32.

272
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,440
And then after 32.

273
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,960
They made like 64.

274
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,860
And then 128.

275
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,540
So I just...

276
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,940
I just kept...

277
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,300
Um...

278
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,100
Um...

279
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,620
I just kept like upgrading.

280
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,860
More and more.

281
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,620
I just keep...

282
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,180
I just keep adding more data.

283
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,500
Because if...

284
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,740
Instead of deleting...

285
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:40,960
Uh...

286
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,220
Deleting...

287
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,140
Uh...

288
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,620
More...

289
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,580
Deleting any of my stuff.

290
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,440
I just add more.

291
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm hearing a buzz in the background.

292
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,500
It could just be the air con.

293
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,940
My sound guy is like...

294
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,680
Um...

295
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,580
Saying like...

296
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,640
Oh, I'm hearing a buzz.

297
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,660
It could be the air con.

298
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,720
I don't fucking know.

299
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,340
There's a...

300
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,280
I'm like...

301
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm like in my own room.

302
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,100
For this.

303
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,080
Alright, let's try one more time.

304
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,240
Connect to USB.

305
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,540
I can't do it via Wi-Fi for some reason.

306
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
So I have to do it via...

307
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,100
Connect via USB.

308
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,840
But it's still...

309
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,520
Oh my gosh.

310
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,740
It's still not connecting.

311
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,620
I guess we'll...

312
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,480
Maybe I need like an official iPhone cable.

313
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,480
And I don't have that.

314
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,720
Maybe that's why...

315
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,220
Oh, whatever.

316
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,400
We'll just be a PNG.

317
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
We'll just be a PNG.

318
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,700
We'll figure this out one day.

319
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,680
Um...

320
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,940
Is it the mic?

321
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,020
Um...

322
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,740
You hear it?

323
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,580
I don't know.

324
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,470
Do you guys actually hear it?

325
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,420
I feel like it's the air con.

326
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,600
Maybe I'll do like...

327
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,360
This?

328
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,500
Uh...

329
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,080
Is it the air con?

330
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,640
It could be the air con.

331
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,800
Yeah.

332
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,740
Okay.

333
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,600
Alright.

334
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,900
Alright.

335
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,020
It's fine.

336
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,780
Like, this is the way it is.

337
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,920
Okay, so they actually have a different room.

338
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,200
But because it's the launch of the new...

339
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,180
Uh...

340
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,880
It's the launch of the new season.

341
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,440
Um...

342
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,120
Um...

343
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,040
The actual streaming rooms are taken right now.

344
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,280
And...

345
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,860
So like...

346
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,060
Because there's an actual like...

347
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,820
They have like a little...

348
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,360
It's so crazy.

349
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,160
Okay, so...

350
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,420
Okay.

351
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,720
So for those who don't know...

352
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm currently in Guangzhou right now in China.

353
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,600
Uh...

354
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Because that is where the Marvel Rivals Studio is.

355
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,840
So I'm literally in China right now.

356
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,940
That's why I'm like...

357
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,780
I have to wake up at 6 in the morning.

358
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,560
I...

359
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,740
I...

360
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,360
So...

361
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,520
That's where they're...

362
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:37,780
Okay.

363
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,520
So the Marvel Rivals Studio is actually in two different areas.

364
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,500
They have campuses in...

365
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,300
Um...

366
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,060
Different places.

367
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,920
Okay.

368
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,740
It's literally public information.

369
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,560
Like...

370
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,440
The literally...

371
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,080
Marvel Rivals First Land...

372
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,260
Is in Guangzhou.

373
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,000
Like it's everywhere.

374
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,420
Like...

375
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,800
What do you mean fucking...

376
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,280
Like...

377
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't dox yourself.

378
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,500
Like...

379
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,140
It's like literally...

380
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,740
If you Google...

381
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,440
Marvel Rivals Studio...

382
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,000
It's like...

383
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,560
Guangzhou.

384
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,880
How do I fucking hide that?

385
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,780
How do I...

386
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,340
How do I fucking hide that shit?

387
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,100
Anyway.

388
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,000
So...

389
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
It's actually crazy.

390
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,580
Because...

391
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,060
Um...

392
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,980
They have...

393
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,740
Four campuses...

394
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,200
Across Guangzhou.

395
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,320
And then you know how like...

396
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,420
Okay.

397
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,980
So like in NA...

398
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,580
Um...

399
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,020
You know when you go to like a studio?

400
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,500
It's like in one building.

401
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,120
Right?

402
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,640
But like...

403
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:35,740
Here?

404
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,260
It was like a fucking university campus.

405
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,740
So like you go to...

406
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,180
There's like different buildings...

407
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,560
For different like...

408
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:42,940
Um...

409
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,880
For different like...

410
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,080
Uh...

411
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,500
Areas.

412
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,960
But it was like one out of four campuses...

413
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,980
Around...

414
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,500
Um...

415
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:50,800
Uh...

416
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,660
Around Guangzhou.

417
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,480
So...

418
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,420
And they also have some in Hangzhou too.

419
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,940
So it was...

420
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,360
They have like...

421
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,980
It's like their own little university campus.

422
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,860
So they'll have like...

423
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,740
A coffee shop.

424
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,660
They'll have like stores.

425
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,800
They'll have like pharmacies.

426
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,820
And stuff like that.

427
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,160
They have like...

428
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,280
A giant-ass cafeteria building and everything.

429
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,900
It's crazy.

430
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,340
They also have peacocks.

431
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,340
I'll show you a picture of them.

432
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,560
Because apparently... Also, SoundGuy, let me know if I need to lower my mic.

433
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:28,140
So, apparently, their CEO of NetEase... By the way, Marble Rival Studio is like...

434
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,940
The company that makes it is NetEase.

435
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,700
And they're one of the biggest game companies in China.

436
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,540
But anyway, the NetEase CEO believes in Feng Shui.

437
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,240
So, basically, the reason why there's...

438
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,380
There's basically a bunch of random animals in different campuses.

439
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,240
And one of the staff took me to the peacock area.

440
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,320
Because the Feng Shui master told them...

441
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,660
If you put peacocks in your campus, you'll be more lucky for the company.

442
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,440
So, they literally have a peacock area.

443
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,860
And the funny thing is that they're all men.

444
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,740
I was like, wait, where are the female peacocks?

445
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,440
They're all men.

446
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,840
And then the staff was like, wait, how do you can tell?

447
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
Because, like, male peacocks are the ones with the flashy feathers.

448
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
You know, the blue peacocks.

449
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,440
And then, like, the females are, like, brown.

450
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,060
So, like, um...

451
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,120
But yeah, they have, like, a fucking peacock area.

452
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
It was so cool.

453
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,020
It was so cool.

454
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,680
Yeah, they're, like, um...

455
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,320
Uh, they're...

456
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,600
But yeah, apparently it was, like, for Feng Shui and stuff.

457
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,160
Because, like, I don't know if you ever...

458
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,700
Because, like, my mom was, like, obsessed with Feng Shui.

459
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,440
So, like, I know a lot about it.

460
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,560
Um, but I thought it was very interesting.

461
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,700
Like, how the campus was designed to optimize Feng Shui.

462
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:44,860
Um...

463
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:45,740
Uh...

464
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,440
Yeah, the boys only club.

465
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,900
Yeah, it was just all men.

466
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,120
I was, like, where are the ladies here?

467
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

468
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,840
Uh...

469
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,560
Uh...

470
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,960
But yeah, no, I'm so...

471
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,140
I'm so tired, though.

472
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,080
Like, I have...

473
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,820
I wanted to stream at, still, like, an NA time.

474
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,900
But, yeah, it took a lot of sacrifice.

475
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:20,360
Okay, so, for those who don't know, I was invited by the, uh, Marvel Rivals Studio slash NetEase To, uh, fly out of Guangzhou.

476
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,920
To, like, you know, get a little tour of... Oh my gosh, it's been so long since I've streamed.

477
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,240
I don't even know how to talk anymore.

478
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,020
I... Oh wait, I can do it live now!

479
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,100
Let me, give me a sec, let me tweet that out that I'm live now.

480
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,620
But, like, I can't really, um, do the... share it on Twitter.

481
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,940
I'll just quote retweet myself and be like, live now!

482
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,200
So I'm bouncing all over the place.

483
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,280
I'm, like, actually all over the place right now.

484
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,260
I forgot how to stream.

485
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,760
Um, but I've been very incognito.

486
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,180
So, also, like, only the staff sort of know.

487
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,780
Like, only the staff... So, for those who don't know, there's a lot of people here.

488
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,960
There's, like, um, you know, other content creators here that they invited.

489
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,860
Um, and, um, other, you know, players and everything.

490
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,440
But the great thing about me is that I can blend in.

491
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,520
Because, you know, like, I'm Chinese.

492
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,220
That's... That's the best part.

493
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,400
So, like, I just look like a staff member while I walk around.

494
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,240
Yeah, so, like, I don't have to worry.

495
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,960
I...

496
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,640
The best is guys.

497
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,540
Um, but I don't talk.

498
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:40,780
Okay.

499
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,240
And then, the best thing is that I've actually been speaking Chinese with the staff, too.

500
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:52,620
Because, like, um, for those who don't know, people, um, uh, people in Guangzhou speak Cantonese.

501
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,740
And then, so, I've just been speaking Cantonese with all the staff members.

502
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,080
I've been hanging out with them.

503
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,720
And, like, we've been gossiping and stuff.

504
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,640
We've been... We've been gossiping.

505
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,020
And, uh, like, I've had, like, dinners with the staff, too.

506
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,280
So, like, we would just all, like, get together.

507
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,100
And, like, you know, after... After Latin.

508
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,180
And we just, like, gossip and, like, have beer.

509
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
And, like, I actually had beer with the staff.

510
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,100
And we were just hanging out and, like, talking in Chinese.

511
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,340
I'm basically staff, yeah, yeah.

512
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,300
Okay, so, wait, let me tweet out that I'm live.

513
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,300
Bureau clock, yeah.

514
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,220
It's been fun, though.

515
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:42,120
It's been really fun, like, interacting with, like, I like to say interacting with everyone, but, like, interacting with the staff.

516
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
I have not talked to anybody else.

517
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,520
I have not talked to anybody else.

518
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,380
I've mostly been talking to staff, because I've been, like, you know, like, incognito, like, ooh.

519
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:06,820
Apparently, um, um, some of, I've, from what I've heard, some of the players were like, wait, Doki Bird is here?

520
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:20,760
And, like, apparently, one, like, I don't remember which social media manager, but the social media manager requested if I could, like, give them an autograph.

521
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:34,260
After I posted, tweeted out that, like, it was, like, one of the eSport team's social media managers, and they, like, requested from the staff if, like, like, if they could get my autograph or something, because they're, like, wait, she's here?

522
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,220
Like, I'm...

523
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,360
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

524
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,060
I was, like, perfect disguise.

525
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,120
I'm Chinese.

526
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,500
Perfect.

527
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,120
No one will expect anything.

528
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,520
Okay, wait, let me tweet out that I'm live real quick.

529
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
No worries.

530
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,320
The only issue is that I cannot read.

531
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,260
Oh my gosh.

532
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,860
Okay, wait.

533
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:05,920
Okay.

534
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,940
I know I'm, like, jumping all over it, because I have so many things I want to tell you guys, but, uh, okay.

535
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,080
Uh, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

536
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:24,280
Uh, okay, so apparently the sound guy was like, we gotta do something with your compressor later, but for now, um, we'll fix that later.

537
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,180
Don't worry, I'm just doing one stream, and then I'm out.

538
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And then I'll do my, and then my next stream will be back home.

539
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,760
I just wanted to, like, talk about a little bit of my trip, and then the next stream I'll be back home.

540
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,540
I also miss you guys.

541
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,100
I hope you guys didn't forget who I am.

542
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,720
I am in Versaunt.

543
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,180
I'm sorry, it's the aircon.

544
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,540
It's so fucking hot.

545
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,740
It's so fucking hot outside.

546
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,820
Uh, it's the aircon.

547
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,960
It's, it's like that, sadly.

548
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,140
I'm sorry about the buzzing.

549
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,860
Um, okay, let me tweet out that I'm live.

550
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,980
Is the buzzing, like, super annoying, or is it okay?

551
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,960
Uh, it's fine?

552
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,300
Okay, I'm trying to...

553
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,420
Oh, Twitter's so slow.

554
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm trying to tweet out that I'm here.

555
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,600
But, like, okay, whatever.

556
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,900
You guys can... Oh my gosh, wait, no, I should do it.

557
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,960
Alright, uh, it's not that bad.

558
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,980
Okay, I'm gonna use my data real quick so I can just tweet out that I'm here.

559
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
I'm, I'm live.

560
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,480
I'm gonna use my data super quick just for that.

561
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,820
I think I'm gonna be paying a lot of money on my data.

562
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,460
Because I want faster internet.

563
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,260
My data is the fastest.

564
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,280
Live!

565
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,020
Now!

566
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,440
Alright.

567
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,420
There you go.

568
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,160
I did it.

569
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,280
Okay, and then I put back my Wi-Fi.

570
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,140
Okay.

571
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,980
Oh.

572
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,400
What was I gonna say?

573
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,900
Okay.

574
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,600
Um.

575
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,380
I'll explain the story later.

576
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,260
But.

577
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,040
Every time.

578
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,720
Okay, so it's been so long since I spoke or, like, I guess, like, listened to Chinese.

579
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,360
Both Mandarin and Cantonese.

580
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,520
So, like, um, whenever, like, I don't know what the fuck you're saying to me.

581
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,080
I'd be like,

582
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,120
I'm sorry, I'm Canadian.

583
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,560
I've been, I've been using that excuse everywhere.

584
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,980
Every time I don't know what they're saying, I just be like, I'm sorry, I'm Canadian.

585
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,340
And then it works every time.

586
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,300
They'll be like, oh, okay.

587
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,000
And they'll, like, treat me like a child because I don't know what they're saying.

588
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,880
Because, like, there's some words, there's some words that I don't know what they're saying at all.

589
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,700
So I was just like, oh, I'm sorry.

590
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,800
And it works.

591
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,640
So I just be like, oh.

592
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,060
Because, like, if we're ordering food or if we're paying and I don't know what they're saying, I'm just like, I'm sorry, I'm Canadian.

593
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
So, it's just... So, it works.

594
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,660
It works every time.

595
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,000
It works every time.

596
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,340
And then, like, try it through, like, oh, I understand.

597
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,600
I understand.

598
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,420
We gotta treat this one like a child.

599
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm like, yay!

600
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,160
Using the Canadian card.

601
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,340
Cause, like, okay.

602
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,660
I'll tell you guys why.

603
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,280
Okay, so.

604
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,520
So, it's been eight years since I've been in China.

605
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,440
I think.

606
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,060
I don't know.

607
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,540
Maybe more.

608
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,020
So, those eight years, a lot have changed.

609
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,100
It's crazy.

610
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,880
It's actually crazy how everything changed in eight years.

611
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,220
And one of the biggest changes is that they don't accept cash or credit cards anymore.

612
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,420
And, like, I don't...

613
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:02,940
So, everything has to be done by... by paid, like, electronically by, like, um, a chat thing called WeChat.

614
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,640
Or Alipay.

615
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,260
Mostly.

616
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,060
So, yeah.

617
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,280
It's all QR codes.

618
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,680
That's why, like, you see, like, in, like, Asian streaming sites, everybody uses QR codes.

619
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,500
Cause it's so integrated into society.

620
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,720
But not for, like, NA.

621
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,300
Cause we're, like, we... we're, like, what the fuck is a QR code?

622
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:18,940
We're...

623
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,420
They're, like, why are we... why do we need to scan a QR code for shit?

624
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,980
Um...

625
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,200
So, yeah.

626
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,860
So, they don't accept cash or they don't accept credit card.

627
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,020
So, sometimes, um, we have to scan a QR code to, like, look... get a menu.

628
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,300
So, like, when I'm, like, walking around, I'm, like, walking around by myself to, like, restaurants.

629
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:47,880
Like, when I walked around to my first restaurant, I didn't realize that, like, even menus are now QR codes.

630
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,780
And it, like... and when you scan a QR code, like, you don't get a physical menu.

631
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,920
When you scan a QR code, it directs you straight to an app.

632
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,460
And, like, the thing is, I'm using data.

633
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:12,360
So, because I'm not connected to Chinese internet, or, like, a Chinese data plan, or, I don't know, Chinese Wi-Fi, my data plan, which is Canadian, can't connect to the menu app.

634
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,760
I can't... I can't connect to the app.

635
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,280
Because I need... I need, like, a Chinese internet plan to, like, access it.

636
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:24,920
Yeah.

637
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,240
So... so... yeah.

638
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,460
And...

639
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,020
Um...

640
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,380
So, I was so confused.

641
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,240
I was, like, oh, no.

642
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,760
I should have got... I should have got an internet plan when I came here.

643
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,280
By the way, my decision to accept the invitation was so last-minute.

644
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,900
Literally, like, you know, when I was, like, guys, I'm gonna go on a vacation.

645
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:58,020
Two, like, like, like, um, when I... after the Fate Trigger tournament, I'm like, yippee, vacation starts tomorrow.

646
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,560
The day before that tournament, I decided to go to China.

647
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,040
Like...

648
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,140
So, I...

649
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,000
Needless to say, I didn't prepare a lot for this trip.

650
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,840
I was not... I was not prepared.

651
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,800
I was not ready at all for a 14-hour-plus journey.

652
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,320
Um...

653
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,540
Dookie, please.

654
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,020
It's my first day as a submarine captain.

655
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:29,720
Okay.

656
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,440
Anyway.

657
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,120
Anyway.

658
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,400
So, um, um...

659
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,620
So, when I tried to scan the app, it, like, didn't lead me to anywhere.

660
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,140
Because, like, you have to use, like, um, the Chinese internet plan.

661
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,860
Like, like, it has to be Chinese internet.

662
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,520
It can't be, like, like, foreign countries.

663
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,400
Like, you know, like, because my plan was...

664
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,720
I'm using roaming data from Canada.

665
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,080
Uh, so I could, like, access Twitter because I'm brainwanted.

666
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,260
Um, and YouTube videos.

667
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,100
Anyway.

668
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,620
So, um...

669
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,220
So, I, like, the...

670
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,260
I, like, held a lady over.

671
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,780
Because, like, uh, I don't know if you guys know this, but, like, waiters aren't assigned to your tables in Asian countries.

672
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,680
So, you can hail anyone over.

673
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,100
So, I hailed a lady over.

674
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,520
And then she was, like, oh, just...

675
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,280
Because I was, like, can I have a menu?

676
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,020
And I was, like, because I don't know how to say menu in Chinese.

677
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,160
And...

678
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,080
So, she was, like, oh, you can scan the app.

679
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,500
And I was, like...

680
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,280
Well, she's not a darn.

681
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm Canadian.

682
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,120
And then she gave me a physical menu.

683
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,660
It works every time.

684
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,100
It hasn't failed me yet.

685
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,260
And then she just gave me a physical menu.

686
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,600
And it was, like, oh, you just ticked this.

687
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,980
And then when you pay, they give you...

688
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,260
So, when they give you the receipt, there's, like, a QR code on the receipt.

689
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,200
So, when you pay for it, you scan the QR code.

690
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,040
And then it leads you to the app to pay.

691
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,280
Because, like, nothing... everything is digital now.

692
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,160
Like, you don't, like, have to, like...

693
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,180
You don't... you literally pay and you can just leave on your...

694
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,660
Like, you can pay on your phone and just leave.

695
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,700
And then, so, I was, like, okay.

696
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,600
Well, clearly, I can't do that.

697
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,280
So, I, like, held a waitress over.

698
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,640
And she was, like, oh, you can just come over here.

699
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,240
And I just... I just scanned my QR...

700
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,460
Because I have a QR code to my wallet now.

701
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,660
Because I use WeChat.

702
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,020
So, I have my QR code.

703
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,940
And I just scanned it.

704
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,760
Like, I had to, like, physically walk there and scan it.

705
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,240
And I'm, like, yay.

706
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,300
I don't have to, like, wash dishes.

707
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,480
Yeah, so, yeah, so, you know, it's been fun.

708
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,160
Oh, my gosh.

709
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,840
It's crazy.

710
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,840
Learning about...

711
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,640
Okay, so, I've been hanging out with a lot of the Marvel Rivals staff team.

712
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,260
Because, like, I just speak...

713
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,480
Because they're, like, oh, my God, you speak Cantonese?

714
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,600
And I was, like, yeah, I speak Cantonese.

715
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Yeah, I grew up here, like, for 10 years.

716
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,560
So, like, I was, like, chatting with them.

717
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,320
And I was telling them about, like, you know, how everything's digital now.

718
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,160
Like, with WeChat.

719
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,480
Like, paying with WeChat and stuff like that.

720
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,560
And then one of the staff was, like...

721
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,700
Because I was just having a conversation with one of them.

722
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,160
And she was telling me how, like, oh, yeah.

723
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,900
Like, even, like, the homeless people.

724
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,640
When you, like...

725
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,920
When they, like, ask for money.

726
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,980
They, like...

727
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,820
They don't want cash.

728
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,420
They put out their QR code out.

729
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,180
And then you...

730
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,740
You give money via QR code.

731
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,600
I was, like, wait, are you...

732
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,220
You're not fucking with me, right?

733
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,280
I was, like, what?

734
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,900
Like, yeah.

735
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,380
I was, like, oh, my God.

736
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,820
I was, like, what?

737
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,240
Oh, you...

738
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,180
I was, like, oh, my God.

739
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,820
This is, like, a whole new world.

740
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,120
I was, like, oh, my God.

741
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,120
Um...

742
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,180
Yeah, so...

743
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,820
They have...

744
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,120
They use, like, QR code cheats and stuff, too.

745
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,040
They, like, have their QR codes printed out.

746
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,140
And you can give homeless people money by scanning the QR code and everything.

747
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,860
I was, like, holy shit.

748
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,560
I was, like, whoa.

749
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,720
Yeah, like, uh...

750
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,540
Because, like, nobody, like...

751
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,020
Because, like, no one uses cash anymore.

752
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,620
Like, no one really accepts cash.

753
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,620
Um...

754
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,860
Because, like, it's linked to your WeChat wallet or Alipay.

755
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,460
I think that...

756
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,620
Yeah, Alipay is the other one.

757
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,700
Um...

758
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,240
But I thought it was so interesting.

759
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,280
I was, like, what?

760
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,160
That's real?

761
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,660
And then she was, like, yeah, no, it's true.

762
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,380
It's actually true.

763
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,720
Um...

764
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,300
Oh, yeah.

765
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,240
And, like...

766
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,140
Okay, so...

767
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,740
Everything here...

768
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,460
Um...

769
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,560
Um...

770
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,100
Everything here...

771
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,960
Um...

772
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Is, like, has its own app.

773
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,120
So there's no Uber here.

774
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,840
Because Uber is so fucking expensive in general.

775
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,640
So, like, um...

776
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:09,940
Uh...

777
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,720
Wake up, Samurai!

778
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,480
You got spare change to get...

779
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,000
Um...

780
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,140
Luca, thank you for the super chat.

781
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,420
Thank you.

782
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:16,880
Thank you.

783
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,720
So, um...

784
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,760
It's, uh...

785
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,280
Oh, no, sorry.

786
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,640
I lost my train of thought.

787
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,980
I lost my...

788
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,620
I lost my train of thought.

789
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
What was I talking...

790
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,300
I'm sorry.

791
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,140
I'm all over the place.

792
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,500
It's been a while since I've streamed.

793
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,120
And it's been a while since I've, like, talked in English, too.

794
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,980
To be fair.

795
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,540
I've been talking in Chinese, like, majority of my time here.

796
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,340
Um...

797
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:37,720
Oh, yeah, sorry.

798
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,500
Uber is, like, super expensive.

799
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,460
So, um...

800
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,020
Um...

801
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,880
So, in China, they made their own app called Didi.

802
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,140
And, like, I was so confused at first.

803
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,540
Because, like, they're like, oh, can you book us a Didi?

804
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,740
And I was like, what the fuck is a Didi?

805
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,140
And then, like...

806
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,840
But that's basically Uber in China.

807
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,840
But, like, own...

808
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,680
Like, this, like...

809
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,120
Um...

810
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,320
It's an app for, like...

811
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,920
Uh...

812
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,640
Uh...

813
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,940
For, like, Chinese citizens.

814
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:05,940
Um...

815
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,200
And...

816
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,480
So...

817
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,760
So...

818
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,160
I...

819
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,860
Oh, my gosh.

820
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,860
I'm, like...

821
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,240
I feel like I'm getting robbed by Uber.

822
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,900
I...

823
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,320
I...

824
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:15,800
Okay.

825
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:16,860
So...

826
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:22,240
It cost me, like, five RMB for, like, a six-minute drive.

827
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,740
Uh...

828
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,040
To, like...

829
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,640
Um...

830
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,020
To...

831
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,200
Like, for a six-minute drive.

832
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,200
Because, like, you know, from the hotel to the...

833
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,760
Uh...

834
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,360
From the hotel to the campus.

835
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,600
To a university campus.

836
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,140
And it cost six RMB...

837
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,580
Like, five to six RMB.

838
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,220
And for those who don't know how much that is...

839
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,060
That is 70 US cents.

840
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:40,980
That...

841
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,600
That is...

842
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,740
70 US cents.

843
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,540
Yeah.

844
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,340
Yeah.

845
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
And I'm, like, thinking...

846
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,480
Oh, my God.

847
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,520
I would have had to pay, like, seven fucking US dollars.

848
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,280
Yeah.

849
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,520
I was, like...

850
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,400
Oh, my God.

851
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,760
Yeah.

852
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,780
I would have had to pay...

853
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,380
70...

854
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,240
Do you...

855
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,380
Like, 70 RMB if I used Uber.

856
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,560
But there's not a lot of fees, though.

857
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,100
That's the thing.

858
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,000
I think the reason why it's so cheap is that they don't take a lot of fees, like Uber.

859
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,840
Um...

860
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,120
Uh...

861
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,160
Because there's ads on DD, too.

862
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,300
So, like, Uber, you don't really see ads.

863
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,460
But, um...

864
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,340
DD runs with ads, though.

865
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:29,840
So...

866
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,200
But, like...

867
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,600
I mean, I don't fucking care.

868
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,500
Five...

869
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,120
70 cents?

870
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,880
Give me all the ads you want.

871
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,620
Like...

872
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,200
I don't think I care.

873
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,700
Oh, my God.

874
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,920
Give me a commercial break if it's 70 cents.

875
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,380
Like...

876
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,800
But, yeah.

877
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,580
It's actually worth it.

878
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,660
Um...

879
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:57,800
But, yeah.

880
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,560
Because, like, Uber, it puts fees.

881
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,280
Like, you know.

882
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,400
Handling fee.

883
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,260
Tip fee.

884
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,680
Um...

885
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,180
Uh...

886
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,020
I don't know.

887
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,620
It gives me, like, three fucking fees.

888
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,600
I think DD had, like, zero fees.

889
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,400
Uh...

890
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:10,920
Anyway.

891
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:11,760
Uh...

892
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,520
I could not care less for the ads, man.

893
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,520
I mean, that saves me fucking money.

894
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,660
I don't care.

895
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,140
I'll consume all your ads.

896
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,420
Sorry.

897
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,520
Um...

898
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:23,780
Anyway.

899
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,280
Um...

900
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,700
Oh, my gosh.

901
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,340
I wrote, like, all the stuff I want to...

902
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:27,760
I want...

903
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,040
Oh, yeah.

904
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,340
Okay.

905
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,200
So...

906
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,860
Um...

907
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,240
I'm so fucking stupid, too.

908
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,140
Because, like...

909
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,640
I forgot.

910
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,320
Like...

911
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,660
You know.

912
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,320
Like I said.

913
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,540
YouTube...

914
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,120
And, like, a lot of stuff is, like...

915
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,360
You can't really access here.

916
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,340
Um...

917
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,000
The reason why I'm here...

918
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm able to is because, you know...

919
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm at the studio.

920
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,740
But...

921
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,420
Um...

922
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:46,610
Um...

923
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,800
So, they have their own apps for a lot of things.

924
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,920
But I forgot.

925
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,980
Because, like, you know...

926
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,600
It's been eight years.

927
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,100
I used to use Google Maps all the time.

928
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,380
Even when I was here.

929
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,320
So...

930
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,040
But I forgot.

931
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,520
Like, now...

932
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,480
You don't use Google Maps anymore.

933
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,360
Alright.

934
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,940
So, this is leading to a story.

935
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:04,720
Alright.

936
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,460
So...

937
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,060
One day...

938
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,080
One day...

939
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,000
Um...

940
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,780
The staff...

941
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,660
One of the staff members recommended me a really good restaurant.

942
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,240
So, I decided...

943
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,400
Okay.

944
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,960
I was gonna...

945
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,020
I'm gonna DD over there.

946
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,460
And then I'll walk back.

947
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,680
Because it seems really...

948
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,100
It was like...

949
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,460
Oh, I looked at my Google Maps.

950
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,680
And it was like...

951
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,280
You know...

952
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,500
It's like a...

953
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,400
14 minute walk or some shit.

954
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,060
And I was like...

955
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,820
I can do that.

956
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,740
And, like...

957
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,720
I'm so full.

958
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,480
It would be good to walk off all that meat inside me.

959
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,560
So, I was like...

960
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,360
Alright, Google Maps.

961
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,300
I'll follow you.

962
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,340
And then...

963
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,420
I kept walking.

964
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,180
And I kept walking.

965
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,580
And I was like...

966
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,260
This is long...

967
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,640
I feel like this is longer than 14 minutes.

968
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

969
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,680
And then...

970
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,320
And then...

971
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,640
Finally...

972
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,200
I was getting close.

973
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,220
And then I was like...

974
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,600
It was like...

975
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,980
Your destination is here.

976
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,240
And I looked up...

977
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:08,860
And it was an empty lot filled with, like, a giant-ass empty lot where it's, like, construction and everything.

978
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,680
And I was like, what happened?

979
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:20,940
I was like, did they, like, smash down the hotel?

980
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,240
What happened?

981
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,120
This says I'm supposed to be at the hotel.

982
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:38,680
I was like, did, like, did my hotel got fucking sucked up by a UFO and then it's gone now?

983
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,120
Like, am I, while I was walking, was I, like, in an alternate dimension?

984
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,100
I accidentally walked through a, like, a time, like, a portal.

985
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:55,880
Like, it was, like, time portals or whatever where it transports me into, like, an alternate universe where the hotel never existed.

986
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,700
Doki.

987
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:08,460
It was, like, it was so fucking creepy, too, because it was literally, like, a giant empty lot where, like, they're building something.

988
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,220
Like, they're just starting construction.

989
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:16,580
So, so, it's, like, it was just, like, a giant empty fucking lot.

990
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,520
And there was, like, cranes and everything.

991
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,220
And I was so, I was actually panicking because I was, like, where did I go?

992
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,400
Like, what happened to the hotel?

993
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,160
Like, what happened within two hours?

994
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,940
Like, did, like, the building, like, got smashed down and I wasn't aware of it?

995
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,500
Like,

996
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,740
and so, like, so I kept walking.

997
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:52,180
So, I was, like, oh, maybe the hotel is just straightforward, like, and then I kept walking and then I saw a giant, like, lit up building.

998
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,660
I was, like, that has to be the hotel, right?

999
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,840
And I walked up to it.

1000
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,580
It was not a hotel.

1001
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,860
I don't even know what building it was.

1002
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,300
But I was just so confused.

1003
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,600
I was, like, where am I?

1004
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,000
It says I'm here.

1005
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,240
I don't understand.

1006
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,520
My Google Maps says I'm here.

1007
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,600
And then I had to, like, I had to, like, WeChat message one of the staff members.

1008
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,020
And I was, like, SOS, I don't know where I am.

1009
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,540
It's like, like, I don't know where I am.

1010
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,780
My map says I'm here, but I'm not here.

1011
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,520
And then they're, like, oh, share your location because you can do that on WeChat.

1012
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,600
And then I shared my location.

1013
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,000
And then, like, she was, like, wait, did you say Google Maps?

1014
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,300
And I was, like, yeah.

1015
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,500
And she was, like, we don't use that here.

1016
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,360
We use something called do.

1017
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,220
And I was, like, do?

1018
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,400
And then they're, like, oh, you're actually, it's okay.

1019
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,600
You're actually, like, like, ten, like, six minutes away from the hotel.

1020
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,860
Like, you can, here's how, this is how you can walk over there.

1021
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,640
I was, like, thank you.

1022
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,300
I don't, thank you for saving me.

1023
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,080
I was, like, and I was, like, oh, my God.

1024
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,460
And apparently, and I turned left when I should have turned right.

1025
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,400
And because, like, I had to go, like, a huge, giant loop around to get back to my hotel.

1026
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,080
So, I went on a fucking adventure.

1027
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:43,140
I, I, I, you have no idea how, I wish, I wish I took a picture of the construction lot.

1028
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,400
Because you guys have no idea how fucking scared I was.

1029
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,500
I was, like, did I, did I actually went through a fucking mini portal?

1030
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,180
Like, there's, like, pocket dimensions accidentally.

1031
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,520
I crossed through, like, this is, like, one in a million chance where a pocket dimension spawned.

1032
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,500
And I walked right directly to it.

1033
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,420
And then, like, the hotel was just not there anymore.

1034
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:09,640
Like, I was, like, looking at my Google map.

1035
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,540
It's, like, it says I'm there.

1036
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,420
I was so confused.

1037
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,400
It literally says I'm here.

1038
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,820
Like, how is this possible?

1039
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,440
And, like, the fact that it was a giant construction lot.

1040
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,100
Like, I was, like, oh my god.

1041
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,400
Like, after I travel back, like, I don't know, in the future or in the past or an alternate universe.

1042
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,140
Oh my god.

1043
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,660
Like, so, yeah.

1044
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,800
So, that's my, that's my, that's my, one of my many stories.

1045
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,240
Oh my god.

1046
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,660
All right.

1047
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,360
I'll tell you about my most unlucky day of my life so far.

1048
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,920
I don't know why this happens every time I travel.

1049
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,060
But, like, every time I travel, something will happen to me.

1050
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,460
And, like, the whole time I was, like, it couldn't possibly get worse.

1051
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,900
But, oh, absolutely it could.

1052
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,760
And, like, I actually, I wrote down this adventure.

1053
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,340
I had to take, like, a log note of everything that was happening to me, like, at that point.

1054
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,300
All right.

1055
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:23,780
So.

1056
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,140
Um.

1057
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Okay, so, you know how I said that I decided super last minute that I was going to come over?

1058
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,100
Because, you know, I thought for a long time about this.

1059
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,580
Because I told you guys earlier that they invited me.

1060
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,540
But, like, I was like, hmm, I don't know.

1061
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,100
I don't know if I should go.

1062
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,400
And then, at the last minute, I was like, you know what, fuck it.

1063
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,740
It's the first land.

1064
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,320
You know?

1065
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,560
Maybe it'll be fun.

1066
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:03,100
Maybe... By the way, I found out that no matter what land it is, I'm not really that interested in land.

1067
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,700
I'll say it down.

1068
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,080
So, like, I was like, oh, maybe it's because of Apex.

1069
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,020
Like, um, you know, I don't play as a regular anymore.

1070
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,740
So, like, maybe it was that.

1071
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,500
But then I was like, let me test it out with Marvel Rivalists.

1072
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,920
And then I watched it a little bit.

1073
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,680
I was like, oh, no, I just... I'm just not a land person.

1074
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,240
I just... I'm just... I'm just not a land person in general.

1075
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,580
So, I need to, like, blow my nose.

1076
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,960
Oh, my gosh.

1077
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,940
I don't have tissues.

1078
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,600
Let me text the staff person to be like, can you bring me tissues?

1079
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,880
I need to blow my nose.

1080
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,560
Um... Give me a sec.

1081
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,020
Because I... Like I said, I got sick today.

1082
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,060
This morning.

1083
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,460
Of course, I did.

1084
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,680
I was like, yippee!

1085
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,320
I feel so healthy.

1086
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,480
I need some tissues.

1087
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,560
So, I can blow my nose.

1088
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:03,920
Alright.

1089
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,120
I messaged the staff person for it.

1090
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,600
Um...

1091
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,240
Anyway.

1092
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,720
Um... Sorry.

1093
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:13,960
Okay.

1094
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,620
So... So, I decided super last minute.

1095
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,500
But I had to, like, research stuff.

1096
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,760
Because, like...

1097
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,480
Um... I was like, okay.

1098
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,580
Because they changed some laws regarding how to enter... How to enter China.

1099
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,860
Because of, like... Like, I have a Canadian passport.

1100
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,900
So, I looked up.

1101
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,000
And I was like, oh, okay.

1102
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,820
So... Because I couldn't get a visa.

1103
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,080
Like, uh... Like, uh... A visa in time.

1104
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,540
So, I was like, oh, can I still enter China without a visa?

1105
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,220
And then there was, like... There is one thing.

1106
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,060
And you just have to leave within 10 days.

1107
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,280
So, I was like, oh, that works for me.

1108
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,040
I'll just leave within 10 days.

1109
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,580
And I looked it up to be like, okay, make sure that I got everything correct.

1110
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,800
And I even, like, called, like, the airport company.

1111
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,220
And be like, can I do this?

1112
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,880
And they're like, oh, yeah.

1113
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,440
No, you can.

1114
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,800
As long as you do this and that.

1115
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,920
And I was like, oh, sweet.

1116
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,140
Cool.

1117
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,460
Okay.

1118
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:10,020
And then, and I even, like, called, like, my embassy to be like, hey, can I do this?

1119
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,540
Can I just, like, uh, go there?

1120
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,980
And then, like, leave?

1121
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,580
At least as long as it's, like, within 10 days, I just leave?

1122
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,020
And they're like, yeah, you can.

1123
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,440
Because, like, it's a visa-free travel.

1124
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,280
Like, and you're in one of the countries.

1125
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,740
So, I was like, oh, sweet.

1126
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,060
Cool.

1127
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,020
Foreshadowing.

1128
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:34,760
Foreshadowing.

1129
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,240
So, uh.

1130
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,160
Because I wanted to be straight.

1131
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,300
Because, like, there was no way I could get a, like, a 10-year visa done in time.

1132
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,800
Um, because, like, you can get a 10-year visa.

1133
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,420
Uh, but there was no way I could get.

1134
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,220
Oh, my gosh, I really need to blow my nose.

1135
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,680
Oh, okay.

1136
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,620
Uh, yeah, that's okay.

1137
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,960
Yeah, that's okay.

1138
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,440
And also, okay.

1139
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,980
No, I shouldn't ask for more.

1140
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,840
I was like, can you also get me, like, a drink?

1141
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,240
By the way, they give us free drinks and, like, tea and stuff.

1142
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,340
So, like, I've been taking advantage of that.

1143
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,660
Because it's paid, it's paid by net ease.

1144
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,240
So, like, um, so I was just like, yippee.

1145
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,560
Uh, I have water here.

1146
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,100
I just want to blow my nose, really.

1147
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,300
So, because I'm so stuffy right now.

1148
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,640
Um, you are so demanding.

1149
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,400
Okay, so.

1150
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,740
All right, let me look through my logs.

1151
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,320
Oh, my gosh.

1152
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,300
Okay, I'll tell you the story of one of my tissues here.

1153
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,540
I can't.

1154
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,780
I can't.

1155
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,080
I'm just like...

1156
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,140
I'm just like...

1157
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,540
I'm just like...

1158
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,020
I want to blow my nose.

1159
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,940
Oh, shit, sorry.

1160
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,820
Guys, if you heard that, I was...

1161
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,100
I leaned back a little bit.

1162
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,200
Uh...

1163
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,560
What else can I talk about?

1164
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,960
Uh, before I tell you, like, the story.

1165
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,220
Sorry, guys.

1166
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,320
I leaned back and my headphone hit against my chair.

1167
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,000
Uh...

1168
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,660
I just used your shirt like a man.

1169
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,440
Uh...

1170
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:23,980
Oh, my gosh.

1171
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,460
I, like, scroll down and I have, like, so much...

1172
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,140
So, messages of me just documenting one day.

1173
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,340
Because I was sad and lucky.

1174
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,140
Um...

1175
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,900
Oh!

1176
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,100
They gave me a labubu.

1177
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,020
I got...

1178
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,600
I finally have a labubu, guys.

1179
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,240

00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,600
I got...

1181
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,100
I got a labubu.

1182
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,380
The Marvel Rivals staff was like, this is our present to you, Joki.

1183
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,180
Here, have a labubu.

1184
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,120
And they got me...

1185
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,160
They got me a custom printed outfit, too.

1186
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,480
For my labubu.

1187
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,260
So, like, um...

1188
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:02,980
Like, so, yeah.

1189
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,860
Like, like, they gave me, like, like, an outfit where it's, like, a hoodie and pants.

1190
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,760
So, he's not naked.

1191
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,800
So, my labubu is not naked.

1192
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,420
And, like, the hoodie says, Doki Braid.

1193
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,200
That's...

1194
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,460
And so, I have...

1195
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,960
I have a labubu now.

1196
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,220
It's my first one.

1197
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,000
And my only one.

1198
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,640
I'll show you guys.

1199
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,660
I didn't take a picture of my labubu, but I took a picture of the outfit.

1200
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,260
Wait, I can show you guys the outfit.

1201
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:32,900
Let me see.

1202
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,180
I know.

1203
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,640
It's just so stuffy.

1204
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:37,900
I don't...

1205
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,980
I don't have tissues.

1206
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,180
I didn't bring tissues.

1207
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,180
I have...

1208
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,780
Pop Drops, though.

1209
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,760
Alright.

1210
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,920
Let me see if I can find...

1211
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,360
La la, babubu.

1212
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,600
Oh, wait.

1213
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,060
I want to show you guys this picture, though.

1214
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:01,180
The staff helped me get a picture of this, and I need to show you guys.

1215
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,080
I...

1216
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,200
Okay.

1217
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,100
Image.

1218
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,980
They showed...

1219
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,120
They got me this picture.

1220
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,180
I am forever in their debt.

1221
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,440
Let me...

1222
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,940
Let me, uh...

1223
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,060
Okay, you sort of tell what this picture is, but I still need to resize it.

1224
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,340
But they got me this picture.

1225
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,200
I'm so tired of you.

1226
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,580
Look how tired me I am.

1227
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,140
There's me.

1228
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,740
I'm with Venom.

1229
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,780
It's size accurate, guys.

1230
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,020
No way.

1231
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,360
It got grabbed.

1232
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,720
The costume hides nothing.

1233
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,660
It's so cool.

1234
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,660
There's so many cosplay...

1235
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,180
Like, they hire, like...

1236
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,420
Uh...

1237
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,960
Cosplayer groups to...

1238
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,580
Go to the LAN event and cosplay and stuff.

1239
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,160
And, uh...

1240
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,920
So, like...

1241
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,680
They had Doom.

1242
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,020
I saw Doom.

1243
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,360
Uh...

1244
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,980
Squirrel Girl.

1245
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,440
Psylocke.

1246
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,740
Um...

1247
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,900
Invisible Girl.

1248
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,040
Sorry.

1249
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,200
Invisible Woman.

1250
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,680
Uh...

1251
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,760
Ha ha ha ha!

1252
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:29,760
Ha ha ha!

1253
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,400
Uh...

1254
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,100
Hawkeye.

1255
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:32,980
Star Lord.

1256
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,460
I don't know.

1257
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,020
And the rest.

1258
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:35,680
I...

1259
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,220
Ha ha ha!

1260
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,440
I'm so tired.

1261
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,780
And the rest.

1262
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,700
Ha ha ha!

1263
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,020
Oh my god.

1264
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,820
Oh, I can't tell this story.

1265
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,720
I wish I could.

1266
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:46,960
But...

1267
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,360
Ha ha.

1268
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,700
There was some juicy drama and gossip.

1269
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,160
During the LAN.

1270
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,860
But I can't say it.

1271
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,580
Ha ha ha!

1272
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,520
I can't...

1273
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,940
I can't say it though.

1274
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,440
Ha ha ha!

1275
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,500
Ha ha ha!

1276
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:00,620
Ha ha ha!

1277
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,140
Ha ha ha!

1278
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,060
It was funny.

1279
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,380
I wish I could, guys.

1280
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,860
I wish I could, but, like...

1281
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,200
I'm...

1282
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,160
I'm scared.

1283
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,260
Ha ha ha!

1284
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:10,880
Like...

1285
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,580
Guys, I'm...

1286
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,520
I can't.

1287
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:12,900
Sorry.

1288
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,400
I'm sorry for teasing you guys about this juicy gossip that I could never tell you.

1289
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,820
Maybe in...

1290
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,140
Remind...

1291
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:19,320
Okay.

1292
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,300
Add chat.

1293
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,120
Remind me in two months to reveal the juicy gossip.

1294
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,060
Because then I'd be back in Canada.

1295
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,700
Remind me...

1296
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,380
In two months.

1297
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,360
I'll be back in Canada.

1298
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,480
And, like...

1299
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,100
People might have forgot about it.

1300
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,240
So I could talk about it.

1301
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,700
Ha ha ha ha!

1302
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,040
Ha ha ha!

1303
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:38,660
Ha ha ha!

1304
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,560
And then I could talk about it.

1305
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:42,420
Ha ha ha!

1306
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,100
Because people might have forgotten.

1307
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,820
So then I won't get in trouble.

1308
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,780
Ha ha ha ha!

1309
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:49,660
Ha ha ha!

1310
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:49,860
Ha ha ha!

1311
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:50,660
It's a...

1312
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,080
It's a pretty funny story, though.

1313
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,740
It's pretty funny...

1314
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,240
But...

1315
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,620
But...

1316
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,460
I can't tell it now.

1317
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,700
So...

1318
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,180
Remind me in two months.

1319
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,260
Ha ha ha ha!

1320
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,000
Ha ha ha ha!

1321
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,720
No, it's nothing to do with doxing.

1322
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,480
It's just a really funny story.

1323
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,360
About, like...

1324
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,540
Something that happened to...

1325
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,540
Like...

1326
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,780
For the content creators.

1327
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:14,360
It's...

1328
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,580
It's a really funny story.

1329
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,460
But, like...

1330
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,440
I don't think I can tell the story today.

1331
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,280
I...

1332
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,260
Ha ha ha ha!

1333
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,820
They're gonna find you.

1334
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:23,780
Ha ha ha ha!

1335
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,580
Thank you, the super chat.

1336
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:24,900
Thank you.

1337
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,380
Thank you.

1338
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,480
Where's my tissue?

1339
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,660
Ha ha ha!

1340
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,140
Please!

1341
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,040
The more I talk, the more...

1342
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,220
The more stuffy I get.

1343
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,080
Where is it?

1344
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,520
Ha ha ha ha!

1345
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,440
Ha ha ha ha!

1346
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,260
Please!

1347
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,700
I just want...

1348
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,060
Tissue.

1349
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:47,720
Oh yeah!

1350
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,400
I was trying to be super incognito.

1351
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,100
Because, like I said...

1352
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,380
Um...

1353
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,240
I decided to come...

1354
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,120
Super last minute.

1355
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:57,880
Uh...

1356
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,720
So...

1357
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Because that I decided to come super last minute...

1358
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,360
Um...

1359
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,020
People didn't...

1360
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,400
I had to join the...

1361
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:04,500
Oh!

1362
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,020
Thank you!

1363
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,100
I...

1364
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,040
Look, they got me.

1365
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,980
They got me the thing.

1366
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,640
I needed.

1367
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:09,940
Oh!

1368
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,540
Okay, I'm gonna do my stuff so I can blow my nose.

1369
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,120
Give me a sec.

1370
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:34,270
Okay, I'm back.

1371
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:34,690
Okay.

1372
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,310
Okay, what was I...

1373
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,030
Okay, so...

1374
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,130
I joined the...

1375
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,130
The WeChat group.

1376
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,910
Where it was, like, all the other content creators...

1377
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,570
That were officially announced and everything.

1378
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:43,770
So, like, where...

1379
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:44,990
That everybody knew we're going.

1380
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,130
And stuff, like, publicly.

1381
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,390
So, then I was added...

1382
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,730
Into the WeChat group.

1383
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,950
But the thing is...

1384
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:53,290
Like...

1385
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,510
I've had a WeChat account for a very long time.

1386
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,230
Because, like, that's how, like, I talked to...

1387
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,190
Like, my parents and stuff.

1388
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:02,310
So, like, you know, when WeChat was first, like, super...

1389
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,450
Like, 10 plus years ago.

1390
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:05,190
So...

1391
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,650
The thing about that...

1392
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:07,650
Is that...

1393
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,690
Back then...

1394
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,550
Um...

1395
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,490
It's, like, user ID and stuff like that.

1396
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:12,330
Like, you just know...

1397
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,250
It was, like, first...

1398
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:13,910
Before then...

1399
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,590
Now it's, like, linked to your phone number, I think.

1400
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,750
But before then, you can log in via user ID and stuff.

1401
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,510
Because it was, like, a social media platform.

1402
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,390
Like, it was just a messaging platform and stuff.

1403
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,350
But now it's, like, even bigger.

1404
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:30,130
So, because of that, my account had, like, a nickname that I used.

1405
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:32,130
I had a nickname and everything on the account.

1406
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:33,350
And also...

1407
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:35,710
Um...

1408
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,390
Um...

1409
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,010
The profile picture is, like, something random.

1410
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,330
So, like, people won't know who it is.

1411
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:44,090
People...

1412
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,810
People don't know who it is.

1413
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,130
Because, like...

1414
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:51,470
Because it was, like, literally some random person that joined into the...

1415
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:52,670
Into the WeChat group.

1416
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,250
So...

1417
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,270
The thing is...

1418
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,190
I came over late compared to the others.

1419
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,010
I'll explain why.

1420
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,350
Foreshadowing.

1421
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,030
So, I came in late compared to the other people that arrived.

1422
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,250
Because everyone was supposed to arrive at a certain time.

1423
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:08,850
And I...

1424
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,410
Like, um...

1425
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,850
Or, like, around in the...

1426
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:12,690
In the morning.

1427
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:13,950
And I arrived at night.

1428
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,630
Like, really late at night.

1429
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,610
So, um...

1430
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:22,410
So, uh...

1431
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,030
So, people were like, man...

1432
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,870
Hmm...

1433
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,130
Who is this person in the Discord...

1434
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,350
Like, in the WeChat group?

1435
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,810
So, um...

1436
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,470
Okay, let me see if I can...

1437
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:31,790
Alright.

1438
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,370
So, it's like...

1439
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:34,890
Okay, sweet.

1440
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,410
No one knows.

1441
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:35,810
It's me.

1442
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,650
No one knows I'm coming over.

1443
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:38,810
That's the...

1444
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,030
That's the best part.

1445
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,350
As long as no one knows.

1446
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,090
I'm gonna...

1447
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:43,770
Uh...

1448
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:52,290
As long as no one knows that I'm coming over, that's fine.

1449
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,310
Because I didn't even want the content creators to know.

1450
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:57,450
Because, like, you know, I'm, like, super paranoid and everything.

1451
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,030
Like, I'm fine with, like, you know, staff.

1452
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,190
Just because they're taking me around and everything.

1453
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,430
But, like, you know...

1454
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,270
I don't know a lot of these people.

1455
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:05,150
The content creators.

1456
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,670
I got invited.

1457
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:06,250
So...

1458
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,110
And they also had, like, plus ones and stuff, too.

1459
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,030
That are coming.

1460
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,810
And, like, I'm worried that, you know, they're taking photos and videos and stuff like that.

1461
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,710
So like I didn't want them to know that like you know I'm here.

1462
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:24,330
So I actually haven't met any of them because I've been like incognito and like doing my own thing.

1463
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,790
So I was like sweet this plan is gonna work.

1464
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:35,850
And then... I messaged in the Discord group.

1465
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:40,410
Hey, so what about the portable Wi-Fi?

1466
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,530
Anyway, with the badge of Jokey Bird.

1467
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:54,910
I'm like, no!

1468
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,090
My plan!

1469
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:57,310
No!

1470
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:05,490
So they all knew I was there.

1471
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:09,050
They all knew that one of them is Jokey Bird.

1472
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,850
One of us is Jokey Bird.

1473
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:20,730
In the group chat, like they know I'm... they know I'm there.

1474
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,290
They just don't know which one.

1475
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,390
I blend right in.

1476
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:25,530
But they know now.

1477
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,430
They know.

1478
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:34,070
This was... this was like... the... the... um...

1479
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,970
This was literally like the day I arrived.

1480
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:40,910
I covered, blown, abort the mission.

1481
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,010
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

1482
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,090
Thank you, thank you.

1483
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:45,270
So...

1484
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,750
So I was like, no!

1485
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,110
I have my perfect plan!

1486
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:54,950
So...

1487
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,130
So they know I'm among them.

1488
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,490
But they don't know which one.

1489
00:54:58,690 --> 00:54:59,190
I don't know.

1490
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,970
They keep playing Among Us IRL.

1491
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,290
Thank you for the super chat.

1492
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,490
Thank you, thank you, Luca.

1493
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:07,430
Okay.

1494
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:07,950
Okay.

1495
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:08,250
All right.

1496
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,290
Let me... I can tell you the story.

1497
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:09,750
Okay.

1498
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:10,370
So...

1499
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:12,690
Back to this actual story.

1500
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:13,890
So...

1501
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:14,630
Um...

1502
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,170
The thing is...

1503
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:17,250
The thing is...

1504
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:17,770
So...

1505
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:18,930
I was like...

1506
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,350
Okay.

1507
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,170
Cool.

1508
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,470
I can come over.

1509
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:23,810
And like...

1510
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:25,290
As long as like...

1511
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:25,830
Um...

1512
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:26,910
I leave within...

1513
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:27,390
Uh...

1514
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,590
I leave within...

1515
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:29,030
Three days.

1516
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:30,110
I'm not sorry.

1517
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,190
Leave within 10 days.

1518
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:32,610
And...

1519
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,630
Um...

1520
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,350
And...

1521
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,590
Make sure...

1522
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:36,530
I fly...

1523
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:36,750
Like...

1524
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,990
Out from the Guangzhou airport.

1525
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,170
So...

1526
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,430
My original ticket...

1527
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,370
Was that...

1528
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,630
I...

1529
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,990
Fly from...

1530
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,790
Hong Kong...

1531
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:45,270
To...

1532
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:45,670
Guangzhou.

1533
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:46,790
Like the transit area.

1534
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,010
And then...

1535
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,010
From Guangzhou...

1536
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:49,790
Back to Hong Kong.

1537
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,470
So that was my original plan.

1538
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:52,910
Anyway...

1539
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:53,590
Onto the story.

1540
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:55,710
Onto...

1541
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:57,470
Onto the rest of the story.

1542
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,210
So...

1543
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,150
Um...

1544
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,710
I missed my first flight.

1545
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,130
Because...

1546
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,970
I thought...

1547
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,030
That...

1548
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,550
The time...

1549
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:15,210
Was at...

1550
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,070
1pm...

1551
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,310
Instead of...

1552
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:20,150
1am.

1553
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:21,770
And...

1554
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,050
That day...

1555
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,790
I had a lot of stuff to do that day.

1556
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,030
So I had like...

1557
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:28,810
I had to finish all my work stuff.

1558
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,310
And so...

1559
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,610
Because of that...

1560
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:32,070
I...

1561
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,210
Mixed up my...

1562
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,110
Because I want to finish...

1563
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,970
I had to finish a lot of work stuff before I go.

1564
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:36,930
So...

1565
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:37,390
Because like...

1566
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,790
Obviously I still wanted to use this as a vacation.

1567
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:40,850
So...

1568
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:41,890
Because of that...

1569
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,490
I was like...

1570
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:42,770
Okay...

1571
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,730
I'm just gonna stay up.

1572
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:45,330
So I can just sleep on the plane too.

1573
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,730
And in my head...

1574
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,550
I like...

1575
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:47,970
Thought...

1576
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:48,150
Like...

1577
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,550
Usually I would like...

1578
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:50,370
Check...

1579
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,210
Like...

1580
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:51,970
Double check and be like...

1581
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:52,210
Okay...

1582
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,930
It's 1pm or 1am.

1583
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,210
And I usually do that.

1584
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,870
But I was so tired...

1585
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,550
That I laid on my bed...

1586
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,230
And just...

1587
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:00,130
Disassociated.

1588
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,430
Because I was so tired.

1589
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,550
And then like...

1590
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,850
And then I went back to work.

1591
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:06,670
And then like...

1592
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:07,710
Um...

1593
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,830
I got a message from staff being like...

1594
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,210
Oh, we're gonna be picking you up...

1595
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:11,690
Um...

1596
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,310
At this time.

1597
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:12,870
And I was like...

1598
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:13,930
This does not add up.

1599
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,430
This does not add up.

1600
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,130
Because my plane ride is like...

1601
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:17,770
10 plus hours.

1602
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,790
And then they're picking me up at this time.

1603
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:20,370
Like...

1604
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:20,810
I should...

1605
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:22,370
I should be arriving...

1606
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,590
They should be picking up later.

1607
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:24,890
And so...

1608
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:25,510
By the way...

1609
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,170
By the time I discovered this...

1610
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:28,350
It was 5 in the morning.

1611
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,210
Because I was just staying up...

1612
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:33,990
The entire day.

1613
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:35,910
So...

1614
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,090
It was 5 in the morning.

1615
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,430
And then I looked up...

1616
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,270
And I was like...

1617
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,530
Oh my god.

1618
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,690
Because they're using...

1619
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,690
I don't use the 24 hour...

1620
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:44,050
Like...

1621
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:44,690
Clock time.

1622
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:45,890
It's just like...

1623
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:46,370
You know...

1624
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:46,710
Like...

1625
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,990
PM and AM.

1626
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:49,550
But in Asia...

1627
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,190
They use the...

1628
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:52,450
They usually use the 24 hour clock.

1629
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:53,610
So like...

1630
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,030
That's why I didn't notice...

1631
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,030
It said 1 AM.

1632
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,210
I thought it was like...

1633
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:57,810
1 PM.

1634
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:01,770
Sorry.

1635
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,370
But anyway...

1636
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,090
Anyway...

1637
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,730
I was like...

1638
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:06,610
Um...

1639
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,250
I was like...

1640
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:07,870
Okay...

1641
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,570
Okay...

1642
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:08,790
Shit.

1643
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:10,490
I guess...

1644
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,030
But...

1645
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,690
Because...

1646
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,290
By the way...

1647
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,990
I got business class.

1648
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,970
Because...

1649
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:15,890
I was not...

1650
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,170
Going to...

1651
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,650
Sit in economy...

1652
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:19,570
For 10 plus hours.

1653
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:20,630
I was like...

1654
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,370
This is a vacation.

1655
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:22,150
I'm gonna relax.

1656
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,190
So in business class...

1657
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,690
You can...

1658
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,210
Readjust your flight.

1659
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,730
Even if you miss your flight...

1660
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:28,320
You can...

1661
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:29,330
Um...

1662
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,150
Get a new flight.

1663
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,010
And...

1664
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:31,890
Uh...

1665
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:32,330
And...

1666
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:33,630
It won't charge you that much.

1667
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:34,010
So...

1668
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,910
It only charged me like...

1669
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,770
50 dollars...

1670
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:37,510
To get a new flight.

1671
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,170
So I was like...

1672
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:39,470
Oh...

1673
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:39,990
Thank God.

1674
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,410
I was like...

1675
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:41,910
You know...

1676
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:42,690
I was like...

1677
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,550
Oh my God.

1678
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:46,650
Thank...

1679
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:47,930
Fucking God.

1680
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:48,370
I...

1681
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,750
I did not have to...

1682
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,850
Have to pay so much for a new flight.

1683
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,850
And the new flight was like...

1684
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,110
Within like...

1685
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,050
Two or three hours.

1686
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:56,810
So...

1687
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,310
I didn't pack by the way.

1688
00:58:58,490 --> 00:58:59,930
I was planning on packing later.

1689
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,310
And I didn't do laundry too.

1690
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,110
So...

1691
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,050
Cause I was planning on doing it...

1692
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:04,590
Later.

1693
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:05,330
Like...

1694
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,890
I was literally planning on doing that like...

1695
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:08,070
In like an hour or two.

1696
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:08,850
And then they're like...

1697
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:09,010
Okay.

1698
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,870
The next flight has actually been two to three hours.

1699
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:11,590
So you gotta get there.

1700
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:12,470
So I was just like...

1701
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:14,190
And I was like...

1702
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:14,730
I'll do laundry.

1703
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,110
I'll do laundry in Guangzhou.

1704
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:16,810
It's fine.

1705
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:17,970
I'll just do laundry there.

1706
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,470
So...

1707
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:22,790
So...

1708
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:23,730
So...

1709
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:24,110
So I like...

1710
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:24,610
You know...

1711
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:30,030
I got new clothes on, but then I packed some, like, dirty clothes in there because I was like, I'll do laundry in Guangzhou.

1712
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:30,550
It's fine.

1713
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:31,930
It's fine.

1714
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,410
I did.

1715
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:33,770
I did.

1716
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:34,990
We get free laundry here.

1717
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,290
And then I got there.

1718
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:47,930
And I was like, okay, surely, surely, that's all the bad luck I don't have to deal with anymore.

1719
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,650
Surely, that's, that's everything.

1720
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:56,410
And then I got on the plane.

1721
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:19,490
And the seat next to me was a four-month-old baby and his mother, who also brought her three-year-old daughter in business class.

1722
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:26,690
And, you know, you do business class to avoid the situation.

1723
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:42,010
And I swear to God, you're like, um, I swear to God, like, I knew it was like less than four months.

1724
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:46,990
It was four months and under because it was a, it hasn't even opened its eyes yet.

1725
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:50,110
And it was tiny as fuck.

1726
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,850
Like, it was a tiny-ass baby.

1727
01:00:53,210 --> 01:01:01,070
And I was, there is no way that baby was older than four months because it hasn't even opened its eyes yet.

1728
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:18,910
So, yeah, so, so I was like, okay, maybe I'm so fucking mentally and physically exhausted that I can just sleep through this.

1729
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:35,570
Needless to say, I was very wrong because all that fucking baby did was cry and cry and cry.

1730
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,610
I recorded it.

1731
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,070
I will play this when I'm back.

1732
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:42,110
I'll play the recording when I recorded the baby crying.

1733
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:50,690
And I was literally like, please, someone do something in Minecraft.

1734
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:59,050
I recorded the baby crying because all it did was cry.

1735
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:07,710
Even, even when I, no, I had noise-canceling earbuds.

1736
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:11,310
And even then, I could hear the baby.

1737
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:20,450
Like, it's not, it's the type of baby crying where he, oh my god, where it's like, you know, they're crying because it's like a defense mechanism because they want, like, they need something.

1738
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:27,610
And it's so, okay, so, um, she, I needed someone to know.

1739
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,450
Yeah, yeah.

1740
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,350
And, um,

1741
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:39,090
so, so, I was just like, why did you bring your baby gear?

1742
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:41,330
I was just like, why?

1743
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:46,150
And I picked my seat, too.

1744
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,950
I could have picked up, so there's, like, two, two sections.

1745
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:54,570
I decided to get the back section because I wanted the window seat.

1746
01:02:55,510 --> 01:03:02,610
And because, like, the back section still had window seats, so I was like, okay, I wanted to, but the front section had no babies.

1747
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:09,070
Anyway.

1748
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:18,410
So, I got, like, I don't know, um, three to four hours, maybe, like, three to four hours of sleep.

1749
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:23,710
But, which, by the way, I did not sleep for 24 hours before I got on that plane, too.

1750
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:31,850
So, because, like, I purposely just wanted to, like, be exhausted and just, like, sleep on the plane because I really don't, I've been having, like, a fear of flying lately.

1751
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,930
You know, I flew a lot back, like, growing up.

1752
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:37,490
Like, I've been lately, um, developing a fear of flying.

1753
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,930
So, like, to help that, I just wanted to sleep on the plane.

1754
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,450
Just, like, be really tired and just sleep on the plane.

1755
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:48,230
So, so, but then I only had, like, three to four hours of sleep.

1756
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,370
So, I was, like, you know, not fucking there.

1757
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:55,570
I'm like, I was not okay.

1758
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:03,110
So, I got off the plane.

1759
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,050
I'm in Hong Kong now.

1760
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:10,690
Yeah, I'm in Hong Kong.

1761
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:14,910
I was like, surely that's the end of it.

1762
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,310
To my bad, horrible day.

1763
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,270
That should be the last of it.

1764
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:24,530
But, oh, past doki could not have been more wrong.

1765
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:29,410
It was just getting started.

1766
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:50,510
So, I'm, because it's a transfer from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, um, um, there, um, I had to, you know, check in again, um, in the Hong Kong airport.

1767
01:04:50,510 --> 01:05:00,230
So, when I checked in, when I checked in with my, like, uh, booking, um, at the, uh, by the way, I love, I use Cafe Pacific.

1768
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,370
It's my go-to airline for anything.

1769
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:06,270
If I could, if I can pick an airline, Cafe Pacific is my go-to airline.

1770
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:09,250
And for those who don't know, they actually recently updated their business class.

1771
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:11,090
So, like, their planes are so much better now.

1772
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:15,810
Um, because they have, like, I used, I haven't used Cafe Pacific for a long time.

1773
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,210
But they recently updated their planes.

1774
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,770
So, it's actually crazy.

1775
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:23,730
Like, um, they're, the, the plane, the planes they use now, it's so good.

1776
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:24,870
Um, anyway.

1777
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,530
So, I went to the, I went to the check-in booth.

1778
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:30,790
And they're, like, where's your visa?

1779
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,190
And I was, like, huh?

1780
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:38,850
Oh, I'm using the visa-free, um, travel.

1781
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:42,090
And they're, like, you can't do that.

1782
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:50,610
I was, like, what do you, what do you mean?

1783
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:52,430
I can't do that.

1784
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:57,490
I called Cafe, I was, like, I called Cafe Pacific in Canada.

1785
01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:00,530
And my embassy, and they said it was okay.

1786
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,290
And then that's why I came here.

1787
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:06,810
And then they're, like, yeah, but you can't fly back to Hong Kong.

1788
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:13,090
You have to fly back from a, to a, you have to fly to a different country.

1789
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,590
I was, like, what?

1790
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,250
What do you mean?

1791
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:34,850
So, so, so, so the thing is, is that, when you fly back, it has to, it's the only way to use the visa-free travel.

1792
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:38,450
Is it supposed to be a transit travel.

1793
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:43,450
So, there's no direct flights from Guangzhou to where I live.

1794
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:48,990
So, and the only way to get, uh, we have to do transit flights.

1795
01:06:49,210 --> 01:07:05,510
And I thought, and I called them to see if it's possible that Hong Kong is, like, can be, like, an exception for the transit travel to, like, um, go to Guangzhou, and then fly to Hong Kong, and then fly back to where I live.

1796
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:13,150
And then, but you, you could do it, you could do it, you could do it when you're going to Guangzhou, but you can't do it when you're flying back.

1797
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:20,770
So, I had to fly to a different country slash region.

1798
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:32,310
So, I was, I was very lucky that my flight was not gonna, um, was not gonna be available until, like, like, four to five hours.

1799
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:41,510
So, for an hour, for an hour, we were trying, me and Cafe Pacific were trying to figure out how to fix this.

1800
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:45,090
Because they were like, do you have to go to Guangzhou right now?

1801
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,610
And I was like, yes, I have to be there by today.

1802
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:53,110
So, they were like, okay, because they were like, okay, you could stay in Hong Kong and try to get a visa now, like, there.

1803
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:55,170
And then, like, go and get the visa.

1804
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,830
And I was like, no, I actually have to go there, like, now.

1805
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:18,330
So, so, and they're like, how about, like, and they're like, okay, what about you, like, um, fly, like, uh, you, like, um, uh, they're, like, trying to figure out, it's like, okay, how about, When you're in Guangzhou, you take a ferry ride to Macau, and then from Macau,

1806
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:25,990
you fly to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong, you fly back to where I live.

1807
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:28,890
And I was like, at that point, I was desperate.

1808
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:31,430
I was like, I'll do anything.

1809
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:37,110
Because they're like, okay, if you take a ferry to Macau, it's shorter counts.

1810
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:43,410
So I was just like, I don't know, we were trying to figure out what to do.

1811
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:57,210
And the thing is, they were saying, like, if it was anywhere but Guangzhou, we could have been able to fix this easily.

1812
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:04,390
But because Guangzhou is so close to Hong Kong, like, we had to, like, do some fucking weird shit.

1813
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:16,150
Because Guangzhou was so close to Hong Kong, so, like, they can't, like, adjust it so that I can fly back to Hong Kong.

1814
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:18,570
They have to, like, I have to go somewhere else.

1815
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,790
I have to go somewhere else.

1816
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:27,730
And then, and then later on, they're like, okay, we don't think we can...

1817
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,750
They're like, okay, maybe you shouldn't go to Macau, because we don't even know if you could do that.

1818
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:38,030
Like, they're like, they're like, they gave me the plan, but they're like, we actually don't know if this actually works.

1819
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,690
So maybe we should not do the Macau thing.

1820
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:46,570
And so...

1821
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:47,970
So...

1822
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,510
Because they're calling everyone.

1823
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:54,090
They're calling everyone, and they're like, trying to figure out what to do with me.

1824
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:55,510
And because they're like...

1825
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:58,270
And then later on, they're like, okay, you have...

1826
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:04,490
Okay, you have to book a new flight to Guangzhou.

1827
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,830
And then we have to cancel your return flight.

1828
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:13,190
I was just like, what?

1829
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:20,950
They're like, yes, because if we cancel your return flight, you won't be able to fly to Guangzhou right now.

1830
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,950
Because it's linked.

1831
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,370
The tickets are linked.

1832
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:25,750
So...

1833
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:31,970
I had to book a single ticket to go to Guangzhou.

1834
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:33,370
Like, while...

1835
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:33,990
Like, right now.

1836
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,070
Like, my flight was literally in like, three hours.

1837
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,690
So I had to book the flight right now.

1838
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:39,570
Um...

1839
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:40,570
So...

1840
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,090
So I booked a flight right now.

1841
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,810
And then like...

1842
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:45,950
And then like, they canceled my tickets.

1843
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:47,210
Oh no, they didn't.

1844
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:47,990
Because then...

1845
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:48,510
Okay, I'll...

1846
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,610
I'll explain more.

1847
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,210
I'll explain more later.

1848
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:52,210
It's gonna be explained.

1849
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:53,250
I booked a ticket.

1850
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:53,810
A new ticket.

1851
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:54,590
A new ticket!

1852
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,470
But this time it's economy.

1853
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:56,630
Because they're like...

1854
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,870
Because I was just like...

1855
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:58,710
There's no more seats.

1856
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:00,670
So they're like, yeah, you're gonna have to book economy too.

1857
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,590
So I was like, it's fine.

1858
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:03,790
It's just an hour.

1859
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:04,150
Okay?

1860
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:04,890
It's just...

1861
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,110
It's just an hour.

1862
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:08,470
I could survive an hour in economy.

1863
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:10,890
So...

1864
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:11,810
And then...

1865
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:17,550
They're like, you have to find a flight that flies out of country.

1866
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:21,730
And then from there, a direct flight back to your home.

1867
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,090
So then while I was there, I was like looking on...

1868
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,650
And I was like, can you do that for me?

1869
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,310
And they were like, no.

1870
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,530
You have to do it yourself.

1871
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:32,830
So...

1872
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:34,910
And so I was like...

1873
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:36,590
I was like on the phone.

1874
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:37,550
Like I was like...

1875
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,930
Because I was so stressed out.

1876
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,830
Because I was like, I did everything to avoid the situation.

1877
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,030
I was like...

1878
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:46,850
I was like...

1879
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:47,670
On my phone.

1880
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,390
And like trying to...

1881
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,010
Trying to find like a flight.

1882
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:52,990
And it was...

1883
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:58,410
$3,000 more expensive than my original flight ticket.

1884
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,170
Because I...

1885
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:01,870
Have to fly...

1886
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:03,070
To Tokyo.

1887
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:06,010
It's like...

1888
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:06,770
Wow, Doki.

1889
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:07,890
That's so cool.

1890
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,590
You get to have a Japan vacation.

1891
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:10,490
No.

1892
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:13,270
Because I can only stay in Tokyo.

1893
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:15,330
For two hours.

1894
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,490
And then I go...

1895
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,050
Back home.

1896
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:26,290
For a ticket that's $3,000 more expensive.

1897
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,490
And I'm only in Tokyo for two hours.

1898
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:32,950
And then I fly home.

1899
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:36,550
And then...

1900
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,570
And then...

1901
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,910
And then...

1902
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:46,250
So, I was like, okay, that should be it, right?

1903
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:49,110
And I thought, you guys canceled my other tickets, right?

1904
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:53,610
And they're like, no, you have to cancel your ticket yourself.

1905
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,890
Call this number.

1906
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:01,950
And I'm like, please, please, can you cancel my ticket for me?

1907
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,730
Because I was so stressed out already.

1908
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:07,370
I was like, can you cancel?

1909
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:10,370
They're like, no, you have to call them yourself and do it.

1910
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:15,550
So, then, I was like, but I thought you guys were gonna do it for me.

1911
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:16,370
Like, we can't.

1912
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:22,110
But you can get, like, a 3K refund.

1913
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:23,630
I was like, yay.

1914
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:28,010
At least I can get a 3K refund.

1915
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:38,530
But then I also lose 3K for my new flight ticket because I have to fly to fucking Tokyo on business class.

1916
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:44,430
I still have a net loss of 3K.

1917
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:47,990
But at least it's not business class.

1918
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:51,190
It's not even on Cafe Pacific.

1919
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:53,430
I have to fly back.

1920
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,210
Not even on Cafe Pacific.

1921
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,770
I don't get my free food.

1922
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:05,030
Anyway.

1923
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,390
So, I called.

1924
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:11,950
Got my refund.

1925
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:13,570
Canceled my return.

1926
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,030
My other return flight.

1927
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:16,530
I thought that was it.

1928
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:18,530
I thought it was over.

1929
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,510
And I thought I was freed.

1930
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:24,130
I was like, it can't get any worse than that.

1931
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:32,130
I was wrong.

1932
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:33,990
It most certainly can.

1933
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:37,150
In ways I didn't think was possible.

1934
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,490
So, there's more.

1935
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:44,870
So, I waited for my flight.

1936
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:47,910
I was supposed to be ready in 2 hours.

1937
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,530
And I was like, yippee.

1938
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:56,150
Can't wait to finally arrive to the hotel and relax.

1939
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,350
Because the flight is only an hour.

1940
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:07,390
I was like, that's weird.

1941
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:11,310
It's 10 minutes till the flight is supposed to leave.

1942
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,010
Why aren't we boarding?

1943
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,990
Why are we all still sitting here?

1944
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:21,290
Why aren't we boarding?

1945
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:23,310
We're supposed to leave in 10 minutes.

1946
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,210
The flight got delayed.

1947
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,170
But not only.

1948
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:33,370
Did the flight get delayed.

1949
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,570
It also moved to a different gate.

1950
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,170
And if anyone has ever been.

1951
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,110
To Hong Kong airport.

1952
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,730
You know how big the airport is.

1953
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:54,850
So, the gate changed from 40, number 40, to number 5.

1954
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:04,490
So, I had to walk from gate 40 to gate 5.

1955
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,190
Sorry, I hit the mic.

1956
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:08,750
I'm sorry.

1957
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:13,610
So, I was like, what happened?

1958
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:17,070
So, I walked over there.

1959
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:19,310
And I was like, okay.

1960
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:20,490
That's fine.

1961
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,930
That should be the last delay.

1962
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:23,530
Right?

1963
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:27,910
And then, I got to the new gate.

1964
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,390
And then saw that it got delayed.

1965
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:32,770
Again.

1966
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,690
And I was like, oh.

1967
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:38,970
But at least we get to stay here this time.

1968
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:42,210
So, how long was this flight delayed from?

1969
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:47,290
The flight originally was supposed to depart.

1970
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:49,030
At 8 p.m.

1971
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:56,350
It was supposed to depart.

1972
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:57,970
At 8 p.m.

1973
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:00,090
And then it got delayed.

1974
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:01,830
To boarding.

1975
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,250
At 11 p.m.

1976
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,030
At 11 p.m.

1977
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:09,150
And then.

1978
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:11,630
I was messaging the staff.

1979
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:15,250
And they were like, you know.

1980
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,450
If you took a train ride.

1981
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,050
From Hong Kong.

1982
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:20,510
To Guangzhou.

1983
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:22,430
It's like an hour.

1984
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:28,350
So.

1985
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:29,790
To recap.

1986
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:33,390
I've been waiting in the airport.

1987
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:35,570
For like four hours.

1988
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:36,870
For my flight.

1989
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:39,210
And then.

1990
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:40,550
After that.

1991
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:41,950
I waited.

1992
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:43,670
Another three hours.

1993
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,230
Because of the delay.

1994
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,210
But that's not over.

1995
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:50,170
It's not over.

1996
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,530
It's not over.

1997
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:56,150
It's not over.

1998
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:56,550
So.

1999
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:57,470
To be honest.

2000
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:58,790
I have waited.

2001
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:59,890
I have waited at the airport.

2002
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:01,050
For like.

2003
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:02,830
Maybe seven hours.

2004
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:04,930
And.

2005
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:06,010
All right.

2006
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:06,470
So.

2007
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:07,930
You think that was it, right?

2008
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,030
Oh.

2009
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:09,930
Oh boy.

2010
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:11,170
Haha.

2011
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,830
Oh man.

2012
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:19,690
Today's just getting started.

2013
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:20,690
Dragoons.

2014
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:22,130
Okay.

2015
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:22,690
So.

2016
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:24,590
So.

2017
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,130
I was like.

2018
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:26,530
Okay.

2019
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:27,750
I'm hungry.

2020
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:28,810
I'm so hungry.

2021
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:32,650
I didn't eat dinner again, I'm just waiting here.

2022
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:42,130
Anyway, so, they're like, the airport staff was like, we're so sorry for the delay.

2023
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:50,190
Don't worry, we'll give you a 150 Hong Kong dollar voucher for any restaurant in the airport.

2024
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:58,350
All you have to do is just let them scan your boarding ticket, and then it'll be included into, like, a free meal.

2025
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:00,730
Worth, at least, worth, at most, $20.

2026
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:04,030
Sorry, 150 Hong Kong dollars.

2027
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:09,910
For those who don't know, the exchange rate for that, that's 20 US dollars for three hours of my time.

2028
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:17,670
That's 20 US dollars for three hours of my time.

2029
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,630
And I was like, okay.

2030
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:24,510
At least, at least I get a free meal.

2031
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:28,330
So, I decided, you know what?

2032
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:30,870
I still have an hour left.

2033
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:32,490
I'm gonna get my free meal.

2034
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:34,690
And let me blow my nose real quick.

2035
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:35,710
This is the intermission.

2036
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:44,450
Alright, so, I found a restaurant.

2037
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:47,170
And the meal was, like, less than $20.

2038
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:49,270
So, I was like, sweet.

2039
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:50,850
And I was so tired.

2040
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:50,870
Okay.

2041
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:52,290
Let me remind you.

2042
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:52,570
Let me remind you.

2043
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:56,910
I only slept three to four hours within the last, technically, two days.

2044
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,930
It included, like, the 24 hours I stayed up to wait for this flight.

2045
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:07,570
And also, the hours I was, I did not, I stayed up from, like, on that flight.

2046
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:09,110
And then, two to Hong Kong.

2047
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,810
So, like, I was so tired.

2048
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:15,130
Mentally and exhausted.

2049
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:26,890
And then, when I waited, I subconsciously brought out my Apple, my phone and just showed my Apple Pay.

2050
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:33,230
And by the time, I realized, wait, no.

2051
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:37,270
It's a free meal.

2052
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:39,310
They scanned my phone.

2053
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:52,670
So, I ended up paying 15 US dollars for my meal instead of my voucher.

2054
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:55,850
Because all I had to do was bring out my boarding pass.

2055
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:58,390
But instead, I brought out my phone.

2056
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:01,650
Because, you know, you know, routine.

2057
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,270
Like, you know, it's muscle memory.

2058
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:11,770
So, I didn't get my free dinner.

2059
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:15,330
And you must be thinking, oh, well.

2060
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,570
Doki, why didn't you buy something?

2061
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,810
I was, I did not want to eat anymore.

2062
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:21,790
I don't, I don't know what to tell you guys.

2063
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:23,650
I really just did not want to eat anymore.

2064
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:25,570
I was, I ate so much.

2065
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:26,610
I don't need more food.

2066
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,510
I, I, I...

2067
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,350
I couldn't even finish my paid meal.

2068
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,170
That forgot to get for free.

2069
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,370
I couldn't even finish it.

2070
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:35,870
I didn't want to, there was just nothing.

2071
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,990
It was, it was pointless.

2072
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,250
It was pointless at that point.

2073
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:39,070
I've accepted it.

2074
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:40,970
I, I was just done.

2075
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:42,010
I...

2076
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:46,570
Anyway.

2077
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,370
You thought that was over, right?

2078
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:49,370
Well.

2079
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:51,430
So, I got up.

2080
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:56,290
I got up from my chair.

2081
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:01,290
I've already paid because I paid when I was ordering Namiya.

2082
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:04,310
And I forgot there were stairs.

2083
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:07,290
There were two stairs.

2084
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:11,010
Because the restaurant was like heightened a little bit.

2085
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:14,230
I thought it was a ramp, but it was two stairs.

2086
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,090
And this is where fall damage came in.

2087
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:23,530
And, well, technically, I should have been able to stop myself with my two hands.

2088
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:33,810
But, coincidentally, one hand was carrying a bag of gifts that I was going to give to the Marvel Rivals staff that I bought in the airport.

2089
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,610
The other hand, I was holding my phone.

2090
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:41,550
And then my bag had my laptop in it.

2091
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,470
So, there was a lot of front weight going on.

2092
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:54,150
So, I couldn't cushion my fall with my arms or my head.

2093
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:57,970
So, I landed straight down on my legs.

2094
01:22:58,290 --> 01:22:59,370
Like, hard.

2095
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,890
And then nobody held me up.

2096
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:03,550
I was like...

2097
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:13,130
So, my right leg was filled with, had like bruises.

2098
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:19,750
And then, and then like, my left foot, I semi-sprayed my left foot.

2099
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:24,650
But, I couldn't rest because they're boarding.

2100
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:37,570
So, I was, I was hobbling to the gate because the gate, the gate was like a little bit far because I had to walk to the restaurant.

2101
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:41,150
So, I was like hobbling back to the gate.

2102
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,130
Like, I was like, I gotta make it.

2103
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,270
I gotta make it.

2104
01:23:51,410 --> 01:23:52,250
Bro, okay.

2105
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,150
The fake, the fucked up thing is that it still hurts.

2106
01:23:55,150 --> 01:23:58,630
My right leg, if I touch the bruises, I, it hurts.

2107
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:01,870
Like, I, like, that's how painful I landed on my legs.

2108
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:11,490
Like I said, I couldn't cushion my fall with my hands because one hand literally had like a bag filled with like, like, like snacks and stuff that I bought for the staff.

2109
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:15,070
And then my left hand was my phone, so I couldn't cushion at all.

2110
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,430
So, like, all the momentum went towards my legs.

2111
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,950
And fall, so that's when I learned fall damage exists, guys.

2112
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,990
Fall damage exists.

2113
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:28,450
And I was just like, I was like hobbling back to the gate.

2114
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:29,530
Alright.

2115
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:41,090
And then you think, well, that's surely, surely that's, surely that's, that's, I thought that was the last thing that was gonna happen to me.

2116
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,490
And then I made my tweet because I was like, it's over.

2117
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:47,790
I'm gonna get on that plane and everything's gonna be fine.

2118
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:52,690
That's, and I, and I tweeted, I tweeted.

2119
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:54,730
And I was like, this is it.

2120
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:58,290
This, this is the last thing.

2121
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:02,030
And my day will be over because I'm boarding now.

2122
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:09,330
And so, and so, and so, I was, I was, I was ready.

2123
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:10,170
I was on the plane.

2124
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,850
I was, I got the middle seat too.

2125
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:14,330
That's how fucked up it was with me booking this ticket.

2126
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:16,650
Literally, like, a new economy ticket.

2127
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:20,110
All they had left was the middle seat in between two other guys.

2128
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:24,350
So, I had that middle seat, like, in between two people.

2129
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:27,450
And, and then, so I was like, okay, that's fine.

2130
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:28,190
I'm on the plane.

2131
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:29,750
I'm finally on the fucking plane.

2132
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:33,410
Like, after two delays, I'm finally there.

2133
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:41,990
And then the guy, the pilot, was like, uh, good morning, everybody.

2134
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:50,090
Uh, it seems that we're gonna have a slight delay because, uh, there, it seems to be thunder outside.

2135
01:25:56,270 --> 01:26:11,800
And in my head, I was like, oh my god, am I gonna die?

2136
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:25,800
So, so, so, so, so.

2137
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,700
So, so, so, so.

2138
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:33,560
So we had to sit on the plane and wait a little bit more.

2139
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,440
And it was delayed.

2140
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:53,400
It was delayed again while I was on the fucking plane because I was like, okay, I mean, maybe, Maybe, at least even though it's late, maybe the thunderstorm will be gone.

2141
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,980
That's a good tradeoff.

2142
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:13,860
Anyway, the plane finally was going to take off.

2143
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:20,360
And then, the pilot was like, uh, hello everybody.

2144
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,440
Thank you for flying, Cafe Pacific.

2145
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,900
It seems that there's going to be some turbulence because we're going to be flying in a thunderstorm.

2146
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:33,520
So if you see the fastened seatbelts, remember to make sure your seatbelts are fastened.

2147
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:37,120
I'm like, what do you mean we're flying in a thunderstorm?

2148
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:49,160
Wait, what's the point of delaying for a thunder if we're still going to fly in a thunderstorm?

2149
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,160
What's the point?

2150
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,120
Wait, what's the point?

2151
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,320
What's the point?

2152
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,380
In my head, I was like, oh my god, I'm going to die.

2153
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,140
I'm going to fucking die.

2154
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,040
This is not a good day for me.

2155
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:07,720
This is not a good day.

2156
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,180
This could actually happen any other day.

2157
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,880
I'll say that jokingly.

2158
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:17,040
But today, today, everything is happening.

2159
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:19,700
This is going to be the day.

2160
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,580
Because I was like, everything happened.

2161
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:27,220
I won't even be surprised if I'm on Google search.

2162
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:35,560
So, I was actually freaking out.

2163
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:39,560
Because I was like, oh my god, we're flying in a thunderstorm.

2164
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,220
Oh my god.

2165
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:44,000
The signs are all there.

2166
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:48,480
The entire... The world was telling me to not board that flight.

2167
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,460
And I still... The world was telling me not to fly over.

2168
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,380
And I kept pushing on.

2169
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:56,000
This is my punishment.

2170
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,180
Right here.

2171
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,360
And then...

2172
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:11,020
And what did not fucking help was the guy to my left who was sitting on the window seat.

2173
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,220
He had the window seat open.

2174
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,180
Like, the windows open.

2175
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:28,280
And he was taking fucking selfies and pictures of the fucking thunderstorm that was happening outside while the turbulence was going on.

2176
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:31,020
I was like, please, sir.

2177
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,240
Please, we don't need this.

2178
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:37,300
We just closed the fucking window.

2179
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,480
Like, oh my god.

2180
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:41,720
While we were in turbulence.

2181
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,860
Like, it was so... I was like, bro.

2182
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:48,720
And then he was like, taking selfies and photos of outside.

2183
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:52,600
I could see the thunder and he was taking photos.

2184
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:53,800
I...

2185
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,600
And then...

2186
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:06,240
I just... I just sat there and looked at the TV and looked at the elevation.

2187
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,460
Because there's...

2188
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,100
On the TV...

2189
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,940
On the TV...

2190
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,060
There's like...

2191
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:16,460
Like, you could see, like, where your plane was flying to.

2192
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,300
Or like, the direction your plane is flying to.

2193
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,060
And like, how close you are to...

2194
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:22,980
To the final destination.

2195
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,980
And also the elevation and stuff like that.

2196
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:28,500
So like, I was just looking at it.

2197
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:30,540
And I was like, I couldn't sleep.

2198
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:31,700
You don't understand.

2199
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,380
After everything, I...

2200
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:34,520
I couldn't sleep.

2201
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,460
Because I was like, if I'm gonna die, maybe I could die in my sleep.

2202
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,640
But I can't.

2203
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,480
There was no...

2204
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:39,960
I can't.

2205
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,660
Not with this fucking turbulence.

2206
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,100
Not with it.

2207
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:46,620
So...

2208
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:52,220
Every time the elevation goes down, I was like, this is it.

2209
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:53,480
This is...

2210
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,760
Oh my god.

2211
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,560
The elevation is going down.

2212
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:57,640
This is it.

2213
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,160
This is it.

2214
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,560
And then, I freaked out a little...

2215
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:01,900
Okay.

2216
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,100
This is where I freaked out a bit.

2217
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,020
Just a little bit.

2218
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:07,240
But...

2219
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,080
When...

2220
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,360
When, like...

2221
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,760
We took off.

2222
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,080
Because like...

2223
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:12,520
The...

2224
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,720
It takes 30 minutes.

2225
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,800
It takes 30 minutes to fly from Hong Kong to Guangzhou.

2226
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:17,420
That's how close.

2227
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:18,720
And...

2228
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,980
And so like...

2229
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,240
We took off.

2230
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:24,280
And then literally five minutes later...

2231
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,040
The pilot was like...

2232
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,280
Cabin crew.

2233
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:28,660
Go to your seats.

2234
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,320
We're getting ready for departure.

2235
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,080
We're getting...

2236
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,100
Gonna get ready for landing.

2237
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,600
And I'm like...

2238
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,620
What do you mean we're getting ready for landing?

2239
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,600
We just took off.

2240
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,760
Are we doing an emergency landing?

2241
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,220
What do you mean?

2242
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,740
I don't like...

2243
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:43,540
What do you mean?

2244
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,720
What do you mean?

2245
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,020
We've been in the air...

2246
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:54,560
Like, for, like, five to ten minutes.

2247
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,080
What do you mean we're getting ready for landing?

2248
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,620
I don't understand.

2249
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,020
I don't...

2250
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:03,960
Nani?

2251
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:06,700
Like...

2252
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:12,700
So, but yeah, so, like, everything was in my head.

2253
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,620
Anyway, I landed safely in Guangzhou.

2254
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:17,960
Despite flying through a thunderstorm.

2255
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:21,180
And then you think, well...

2256
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:22,440
Surely...

2257
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,700
I was like, I'm here.

2258
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:29,260
I'm alive.

2259
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,160
I'm in Guangzhou.

2260
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:32,920
I'm here.

2261
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:49,100
So, if you've ever, um, went through immigration in China, you would know how fucking long it is, how long it takes, and how long the lines are.

2262
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,000
So...

2263
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,200
I line up.

2264
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:55,780
I had my, like, um, arrival sheet done already.

2265
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:56,780
And everything.

2266
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,040
Because I did it on the plane.

2267
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,820
And then...

2268
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:02,420
So...

2269
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:03,480
Um...

2270
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,040
It takes, like...

2271
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,980
It took me... I was in the line...

2272
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:08,960
For...

2273
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,040
I think, 40 minutes.

2274
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,200
I was in the line for 40 minutes.

2275
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,440
And then finally, I got up to the immigration officer.

2276
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,380
And he was like...

2277
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:25,080
And he was like...

2278
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:25,720
Where's your visa?

2279
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:32,320
I was like...

2280
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,160
Oh, I'm visa-free.

2281
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,360
I'm leaving within 10 days.

2282
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,620
And they're like...

2283
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:39,560
No, no.

2284
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,300
No, no.

2285
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:41,500
No, no.

2286
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,280
You need a visa.

2287
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,360
If you're entering Guangzhou.

2288
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,080
And I was like...

2289
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:49,820
No, no, no.

2290
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:51,760
Here's my flight ticket to Tokyo.

2291
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:52,300
See?

2292
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,780
I'm gonna fly to Tokyo.

2293
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:55,540
After.

2294
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:56,780
See?

2295
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:57,560
Visa-free.

2296
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,260
I...

2297
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,080
They said I can.

2298
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,360
And then they were like...

2299
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,160
Oh, you're on the wrong line.

2300
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,520
Oh, sorry.

2301
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,320
You're actually on the wrong line.

2302
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:20,540
So...

2303
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:21,960
There's a special line.

2304
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,360
For the visa-free...

2305
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,120
For the visa-free...

2306
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:28,940
Uh...

2307
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:29,740
Travelers.

2308
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,500
They're heading over.

2309
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:36,270
And...

2310
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:41,330
And you can't really see it.

2311
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:42,310
Because it's like...

2312
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,910
All the way...

2313
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:44,750
Far right.

2314
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:46,250
It's far right.

2315
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:47,610
And like...

2316
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:48,550
It's a tiny sign.

2317
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:50,770
So the foreigner line...

2318
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:51,650
Is far left.

2319
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:52,730
And...

2320
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,590
The visa-free line...

2321
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:55,950
Is very far right.

2322
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:57,290
With a very tiny sign.

2323
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:59,550
And then when I got there...

2324
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:01,490
There was no line.

2325
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:03,450
There was literally one person.

2326
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:05,290
There was literally...

2327
01:35:05,290 --> 01:35:06,450
One person...

2328
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:08,650
Manning the booth.

2329
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:10,230
By the way...

2330
01:35:10,230 --> 01:35:11,450
When I was in the other line...

2331
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:13,810
I was fucking...

2332
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:14,490
I was...

2333
01:35:14,490 --> 01:35:15,650
I arrived at 2 in the...

2334
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:16,450
I don't even know.

2335
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:17,870
I arrived at like...

2336
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:18,390
I don't know.

2337
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:19,810
It was like 1 or 2 a.m.

2338
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:20,410
I...

2339
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:21,110
1 a.m.

2340
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:21,890
There was 1 a.m.

2341
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:22,850
They're...

2342
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:24,770
Like they were closing booths and...

2343
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:27,110
Like I was seeing them closing more and more terminals.

2344
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:28,590
Because it was so late.

2345
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:29,490
So like...

2346
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:31,170
It was like 5 that started...

2347
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:31,990
And then went to 2.

2348
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,690
Like...

2349
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:35,730
I just seen them closing more and more terminals.

2350
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:38,050
So it got slower and slower.

2351
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:40,390
Anyway.

2352
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:43,150
So then I went to the far right.

2353
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:44,770
And I decided...

2354
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:46,170
Like I had to write a new form...

2355
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:47,230
For it.

2356
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:50,550
Oh sorry.

2357
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:51,050
Is my mic...

2358
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:51,410
I'm sorry.

2359
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:52,290
I'm going through a lot.

2360
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:55,210
I'm sorry for peeking.

2361
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:56,650
I'm going through a lot.

2362
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:58,930
I'm sorry everyone.

2363
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:00,910
My mic is peaking a lot.

2364
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:02,470
It's a very...

2365
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:05,010
It's a very sensitive story for me.

2366
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:05,730
I...

2367
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:06,790
I get...

2368
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:07,690
I get...

2369
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:09,310
I was very emotional.

2370
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:10,530
I had to keep this...

2371
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:12,470
I had to keep this quiet.

2372
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:13,790
I...

2373
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:14,810
Just let me...

2374
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:17,630
Drama dump just a little bit more guys.

2375
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:19,790
I had to keep this all in.

2376
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:22,590
Until I revealed that I was in Guangzhou.

2377
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:24,670
I didn't want to say anything until I...

2378
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:26,450
I did my big reveal.

2379
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,100
And...

2380
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:32,500
And...

2381
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:34,020
And...

2382
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:34,220
And...

2383
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,320
So...

2384
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,480
So...

2385
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:40,440
I...

2386
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,680
Went to this...

2387
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:42,240
The new...

2388
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,020
The new area.

2389
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,640
I gave them my passport.

2390
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,960
And everything.

2391
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,500
And then they were like...

2392
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:54,480
Show me your hotel booking.

2393
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,500
And I was like...

2394
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:58,940
Huh?

2395
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,940
They were like...

2396
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:07,920
We need proof that you are staying at this hotel.

2397
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:09,860
And I was like...

2398
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:12,100
Oh, my friend booked it for me.

2399
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:12,880
I...

2400
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,740
They never sent me a confirmation...

2401
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,640
Thing about it.

2402
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,160
Cause they booked it for me.

2403
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,300
And...

2404
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:20,360
And...

2405
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,500
They're like...

2406
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:22,560
Okay...

2407
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:22,960
Well...

2408
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,240
Message your friend for it.

2409
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,640
And by the way...

2410
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,200
It was like...

2411
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,300
1.30 in the morning.

2412
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:28,860
It was...

2413
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:30,780
But...

2414
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:32,240
So I was like...

2415
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:32,760
So...

2416
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,300
I messaged the staff.

2417
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,260
And I was like...

2418
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:38,580
I need the confirmation letter.

2419
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,220
I need like the receipt.

2420
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:43,380
And the main person that booked my hotel...

2421
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:44,240
Was asleep.

2422
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,800
So the staff...

2423
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:47,780
Had to...

2424
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:48,720
Call the hotel.

2425
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,420
So they could send...

2426
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,880
The...

2427
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,840
Receipt over...

2428
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:53,600
To them.

2429
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:55,020
And they could send...

2430
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:55,500
To me.

2431
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,220
And then while we were waiting...

2432
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,140
The lady...

2433
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:00,740
Was like...

2434
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,500
Like...

2435
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,640
Just staring at me.

2436
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,980
And I was just standing there.

2437
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:04,600
Mad emoji.

2438
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,560
And she was just standing there.

2439
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:07,740
She was just sitting there.

2440
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:08,980
Mad emoji.

2441
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:09,860
Back at me.

2442
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,800
And we were just looking at each other.

2443
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:12,480
Awkwardly.

2444
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,840
And I'm like, I'm sorry, they're like, trying to get it right now.

2445
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:30,580
And then, and then, and then, and then, she was like, yeah, literally, literally, the green mad emoji, that was us.

2446
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:36,380
And then, and then she was like, do you still have your Hong Kong ID?

2447
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:37,980
And I was like, no.

2448
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,000
She's like, are you sure?

2449
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,960
I was like, yeah, I'm sure.

2450
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,820
She was interrogating me.

2451
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,120
I was like, please, I'm not, please, I'm not, I swear, I'm not doing anything illegal.

2452
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:53,120
And then, later, we're still waiting.

2453
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:55,100
And I need to blow my nose real quick.

2454
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:04,730
Later, we're still waiting.

2455
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:12,490
And then she looked at me in the eye and was like, you didn't book your hotel, did you?

2456
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:24,830
I was like, no, I swear, I swear, they're sending me the hotel right now.

2457
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:28,430
I swear, I swear, I know.

2458
01:39:32,110 --> 01:39:38,330
And then, and then they're like, and I was like, and then I got, and I got the, and then I got the confirmation.

2459
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:41,670
See, the moment she was like, you didn't book the hotel, did you?

2460
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:48,730
I was like, no, I did, I swear, and then I got, I was like, bing, bing, here's the hotel confirmation.

2461
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,830
And then I was like, here's the hotel receipt.

2462
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:01,250
And then, and then I'm like, I'm so sorry.

2463
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:03,270
I'm so sorry.

2464
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:13,110
Okay, and, um, and then I was freed.

2465
01:40:13,410 --> 01:40:14,810
They freed me from immigration.

2466
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:17,610
I was, I got to leave.

2467
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:23,630
I didn't get, I didn't get detained and sent back home.

2468
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:26,150
And I got, I, I was freed.

2469
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,270
And I went to find my luggage.

2470
01:40:28,670 --> 01:40:35,730
And like, thank God, the moment I got there, when, like, it was just like three bags left, and one of them was my bag.

2471
01:40:35,950 --> 01:40:40,190
And on the screen, it was, it said like, oh my God, what did it say on the screen?

2472
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:50,250
You know, in the, on the screen, it was says, coming to an end, luggage claim.

2473
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:55,710
So it literally was about to end for that, for that, like, plane.

2474
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:57,970
And they would have, like, confiscated the luggage.

2475
01:40:58,170 --> 01:40:59,410
It was like, coming to an end.

2476
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:02,850
So I got my luggage just in time before that happened.

2477
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:14,790
And then, and then, I, like, met the staff, and I told, I was like, I'm freed.

2478
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:16,750
Doki is free.

2479
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:22,510
And they're like, oh my God, I can't believe you had to go through all that.

2480
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:25,250
And I was like, how long have you guys been waiting for me?

2481
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:27,470
And they were like, five hours.

2482
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:39,770
They're like, we've been waiting for you for five hours at the airport, ever since the delay.

2483
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:42,430
And I'm like, I'm so sorry.

2484
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:44,430
I'm so...

2485
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:57,450
So, and that was my most unlucky day of my life.

2486
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:59,190
So far.

2487
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:06,670
So far.

2488
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:12,770
Oh no.

2489
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:15,910
For now.

2490
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:19,070
That was my most unlucky day.

2491
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:20,290
For now.

2492
01:42:21,450 --> 01:42:23,570
Don't say that.

2493
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:31,690
I don't know how I'm functioning as an adult.

2494
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:35,490
Guys, I don't know how I get through life in general these days.

2495
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:36,590
I don't know.

2496
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:42,370
God is trying so hard to be like, you should not be alive.

2497
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:43,790
But I'm still here.

2498
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,250
I'm still here, guys.

2499
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:49,950
TokiBur did a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.

2500
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:52,310
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

2501
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:52,750
Thank you.

2502
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:01,070
But yeah, that was day one.

2503
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:08,450
That was day one, chat.

2504
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:13,910
Why I had a terrible day that day.

2505
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:17,330
You guys didn't think it could get worse, right?

2506
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:18,670
It's like you're crazy.

2507
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:21,750
I literally thought I was going to die in the thunderstorm.

2508
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:23,850
I thought it was going to be a fucking statistic.

2509
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:26,910
I was like, why are we still flying?

2510
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:28,770
What the fuck?

2511
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:31,930
Why would you tell us we're going to fly in the thunderstorm?

2512
01:43:32,330 --> 01:43:34,290
Like, what's wrong with you?

2513
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:38,770
Please, no part two.

2514
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:39,590
Okay.

2515
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:42,830
So what we learned from this experience...

2516
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:51,310
Maybe I shouldn't decide to go to China, like, or travel anywhere, like, two days before my actual trip.

2517
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:52,390
Maybe I...

2518
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:59,590
Maybe I shouldn't, like, go overseas, like, two days before I actually go overseas, guys.

2519
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:01,770
I think that's, like, a good idea to do.

2520
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:03,970
I think maybe I...

2521
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:11,030
But after that, I've had a lot of fun.

2522
01:44:11,250 --> 01:44:15,770
After that, I had so much fun, though.

2523
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:17,590
It's been really fun here so far.

2524
01:44:18,270 --> 01:44:20,390
The food has been so good, though.

2525
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:22,090
I love... oh my gosh, I took so much pictures.

2526
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:24,290
I'll show the pictures when... I'll show food pictures.

2527
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:27,990
I'll show some more food pictures when I get back, when I have my skin suit.

2528
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:32,110
Um, and... but, yeah, dude, I took... oh my gosh, the food is great.

2529
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:34,110
I went to the biggest mall in Guangzhou.

2530
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:35,150
It's, like, crazy.

2531
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:36,930
They have, like, four fucking...

2532
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:37,330
Okay.

2533
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:40,230
They have, like, four...

2534
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:45,310
Miniature, like, zoos in there, like, for some miniature animals.

2535
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:46,330
I was like, what the fuck?

2536
01:44:46,610 --> 01:44:49,670
It was, like, seven... seven floors and everything.

2537
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:51,390
It's... it's crazy.

2538
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:55,570
And I'm gonna see pandas later today, too.

2539
01:44:55,570 --> 01:44:58,010
So, uh, I'm gonna go to another...

2540
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:00,610
I'm gonna go to, like, the biggest zoo, uh, here.

2541
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:02,230
I think... I don't know.

2542
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:03,170
There's so many zoos here.

2543
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,430
But I'm gonna go see pandas.

2544
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:06,270
And there's, like, so many pandas.

2545
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:07,530
And I don't wanna see a panda.

2546
01:45:07,730 --> 01:45:08,730
That's really it.

2547
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:10,750
And then, like, eat good shit.

2548
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:12,670
I'm gonna eat good shit.

2549
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:13,750
I'm gonna...

2550
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:14,950
Oh my gosh.

2551
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:16,570
I don't know if I can say I'm gonna eat that.

2552
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:18,250
Because, like, it's illegal in America.

2553
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:23,910
Guys, can I get a pass to eat foie gras?

2554
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:26,850
Guys, I love foie gras.

2555
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:38,210
I know, I know, guys, I know that foie gras, there's some, you know, you know, it's bad in America, but so good.

2556
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:41,030
Why is it so wrong, but so good at the same time?

2557
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:43,390
Why is it so bad?

2558
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:49,130
No, it is, foie gras is bad in the states, I'm pretty sure.

2559
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:54,250
Did they legalize it again?

2560
01:45:57,050 --> 01:46:00,130
I know, oh, wait, they legalized it back?

2561
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:02,550
It used to be bad, I remember.

2562
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,490
Was it not?

2563
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:05,250
No, it was.

2564
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:06,550
I remember it was.

2565
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:08,330
I remembered it was.

2566
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:13,490
Yeah, it's illegal in, it's illegal in some states in America.

2567
01:46:14,110 --> 01:46:18,550
But yeah, apparently, I was told there was a really good foie gras place.

2568
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:23,830
I know foie gras is French, but like, but like, we love foie gras.

2569
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:30,150
And like, um, and like, there's a really good foie gras place, like here.

2570
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:33,110
I was told, I'm gonna eat one time, guys, I swear.

2571
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:34,190
It's my one pass.

2572
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:35,090
Guys, I had a bad day.

2573
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:35,950
I had a bad day.

2574
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:39,310
And I, I guess that duck's gonna have a bad day, too, because I'm gonna eat it.

2575
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:41,590
Equivalent exchange.

2576
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:43,070
Equivalent exchange.

2577
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:44,430
We both had bad days.

2578
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:48,130
But like, I'm gonna eat something to cure my bad day.

2579
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:49,270
I'm gonna eat it.

2580
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:50,410
I'm gonna eat it.

2581
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:50,410
No.

2582
01:46:51,010 --> 01:46:52,170
Go eat it.

2583
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:55,390
One duck must...

2584
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:56,850
Pain for pain.

2585
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:58,530
This is my one pass.

2586
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:00,150
I've had foie gras in a long time.

2587
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:01,130
I haven't...

2588
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:05,450
You know...

2589
01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:09,810
Two wrongs doesn't make a right, Doki.

2590
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:13,250
I had to do so many wrongs, so...

2591
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:15,190
This is my pass.

2592
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:26,910
The one bird shall be sacrificed to bring balance to my day.

2593
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:28,770
Well, yeah, guys.

2594
01:47:29,330 --> 01:47:30,390
Don't travel overseas.

2595
01:47:31,090 --> 01:47:31,550
Last minute.

2596
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:34,250
That's my tip of the day.

2597
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:39,910
I thought, I don't know, I thought it'd be easier.

2598
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:42,050
I even called and everything.

2599
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:45,450
I didn't know how difficult it'd be.

2600
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:47,630
They said it'd be fine.

2601
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,370
I even Googled.

2602
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:51,010
I...

2603
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:54,130
I even Googled.

2604
01:47:54,370 --> 01:47:56,070
But I've been having a good time, though.

2605
01:47:57,050 --> 01:47:59,090
The staff have been, like, super nice to me.

2606
01:47:59,090 --> 01:48:01,130
And, like, um...

2607
01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:05,350
I saw Guan Guan, who is, like, the head dev of Marvel Rivals.

2608
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:08,670
And, like...

2609
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:09,890
I didn't take a picture with him, though.

2610
01:48:10,030 --> 01:48:11,830
But, like, I saw him.

2611
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:13,150
And, uh...

2612
01:48:13,150 --> 01:48:16,410
I saw, like, a bunch of...

2613
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:18,990
A bunch of, like...

2614
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:19,690
What is it called?

2615
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:22,910
Like, a bunch of, like, cool stuff around the campus, too.

2616
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:24,610
I saw fucking peacocks, guys.

2617
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:31,410
And, like, the staff took me to a lot of cool places, too.

2618
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:33,410
And, like, to a lot of places to eat.

2619
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:34,370
Which is the best part.

2620
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:36,590
Honestly, the food is the best part so far.

2621
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:37,310
Um...

2622
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:39,430
Maybe the pandas will also be my top three.

2623
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:40,190
But...

2624
01:48:40,190 --> 01:48:41,310
I haven't seen the pandas yet.

2625
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:42,570
But so far...

2626
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:43,830
So far...

2627
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:45,250
Um...

2628
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:45,930
Um...

2629
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:46,490
Love...

2630
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:47,390
Love the food.

2631
01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:48,630
And it's been great.

2632
01:48:48,670 --> 01:48:49,370
It's been really fun.

2633
01:48:51,470 --> 01:48:51,870
Um...

2634
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:55,250
Never flying to see Toki again.

2635
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:56,470
How did my...

2636
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:59,410
My flying story traumatized everyone?

2637
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:03,230
It was like...

2638
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:04,990
Well, now I'm never gonna fly again, too.

2639
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:09,130
Everyone's, like, traumatized now.

2640
01:49:09,610 --> 01:49:09,690
Yeah.

2641
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:12,410
Um...

2642
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:12,770
But, yeah.

2643
01:49:13,090 --> 01:49:13,630
Freeho...

2644
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:15,030
They put me on, like...

2645
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:15,870
The V...

2646
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:16,750
Oh, it's so funny.

2647
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:17,050
Okay.

2648
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:19,690
Apparently, I found out that, like...

2649
01:49:19,690 --> 01:49:20,150
Um...

2650
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:21,430
We're in the same hotel.

2651
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:24,090
Like, the content creators and, like...

2652
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:24,970
Influencers...

2653
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:27,390
Are in the same hotel as, like...

2654
01:49:27,390 --> 01:49:27,910
The...

2655
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:28,870
The players.

2656
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:31,270
But the players got the...

2657
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:32,230
The...

2658
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:33,670
Like, the lower floors.

2659
01:49:34,150 --> 01:49:36,110
And, like, the lower regular...

2660
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:36,670
Rooms.

2661
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:37,970
And then, like...

2662
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:40,430
All the content creators and influencers...

2663
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:41,710
Got the VIP rooms.

2664
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:42,290
Like...

2665
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:47,130
I was like...

2666
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:47,990
I was like...

2667
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:49,030
Yeah, that's right.

2668
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:50,370
That's right.

2669
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:53,410
I got a fucking king-size bed.

2670
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:55,410
That's right.

2671
01:49:57,590 --> 01:49:58,270
That's right.

2672
01:49:58,270 --> 01:49:58,750
Yeah.

2673
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:01,670
And I don't even need to...

2674
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:01,950
Oh, yeah.

2675
01:50:02,190 --> 01:50:03,650
Do a watch party.

2676
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:06,070
I'm here on vacation.

2677
01:50:06,510 --> 01:50:08,130
Technically, I paid for my own flight.

2678
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:08,470
Okay.

2679
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:10,190
I paid for my own flight.

2680
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:10,890
But...

2681
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:12,950
The Marrival staff paid for, like...

2682
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:13,470
My hotel.

2683
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:14,510
My travel.

2684
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:15,690
Like, my...

2685
01:50:15,690 --> 01:50:16,270
Like...

2686
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:17,670
Like, Guangzhou travel stuff.

2687
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:18,270
Like, you know...

2688
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:19,590
Ordering DDs for me.

2689
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:21,850
And, um...

2690
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:22,750
You know...

2691
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:23,970
Food and drinks.

2692
01:50:24,170 --> 01:50:24,930
And stuff like that.

2693
01:50:24,930 --> 01:50:26,150
Oh, my God.

2694
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:27,190
Like...

2695
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:27,630
Um...

2696
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:28,050
I forgot.

2697
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:31,370
So, one of the staff recommended me a place to eat.

2698
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:33,250
And then, they were like...

2699
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:34,170
Oh, um...

2700
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:34,850
This is really good.

2701
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:35,990
Like, we all love to go here.

2702
01:50:36,110 --> 01:50:36,570
And I was like...

2703
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:36,930
Oh, cool.

2704
01:50:37,190 --> 01:50:37,870
And then...

2705
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:38,730
So...

2706
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:40,670
Obviously, we have to scan a QR code.

2707
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:41,810
And I was like...

2708
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:42,410
Well...

2709
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:43,850
I don't know...

2710
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:44,450
What...

2711
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:45,650
I don't know what this says.

2712
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:47,930
I can't access it.

2713
01:50:48,110 --> 01:50:49,090
So, I, like...

2714
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:50,990
Screenshot the QR code.

2715
01:50:51,110 --> 01:50:52,130
And sent it to the staff.

2716
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:52,670
And I was like...

2717
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:53,770
Can you order for me?

2718
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:55,250
And then, she was like...

2719
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:55,870
Yeah, no problem.

2720
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:57,290
And then...

2721
01:50:58,090 --> 01:50:58,570
Um...

2722
01:50:58,570 --> 01:51:00,030
And then, like...

2723
01:51:00,030 --> 01:51:00,750
Uh...

2724
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:01,610
Like, she...

2725
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:02,210
She, like...

2726
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:03,610
Ordered all the food for me.

2727
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:05,550
And it was a lot of fucking food.

2728
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:06,330
And I was like...

2729
01:51:06,330 --> 01:51:06,850
Holy shit.

2730
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:07,970
And then, like...

2731
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:08,830
I tried to pay.

2732
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:10,210
And I didn't know...

2733
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:12,650
What the lady was trying to say to me.

2734
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:13,710
And I was like...

2735
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:14,730
Sorry, I'm Canadian.

2736
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:18,450
Because I didn't...

2737
01:51:18,450 --> 01:51:20,690
I didn't know what she was saying.

2738
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:21,590
I was like...

2739
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:28,250
I was like, why can't I pay?

2740
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:29,870
I'm so confused.

2741
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:32,170
Why isn't she accepting my payment?

2742
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:34,790
Like, hello, scan my WeChat receipt.

2743
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:39,070
And then, and then I, like, messaged the staff.

2744
01:51:39,330 --> 01:51:41,210
I was like, did you pay for my mail?

2745
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:45,470
I don't know what she's saying, but, like, she won't accept my payment.

2746
01:51:45,790 --> 01:51:49,090
And the staff was like, oh, yeah, yeah, I paid for your mail.

2747
01:51:51,590 --> 01:51:54,590
So, I was like, oh my god, I couldn't understand.

2748
01:51:55,010 --> 01:51:58,510
I have selective hearing for certain words.

2749
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:04,370
Because, like, it's easier for me to listen to Cantonese than it is to listen to Mandarin.

2750
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:11,530
Because, like, a lot of words, like, Cantonese, there's, like, a lot of words don't really overlap sometimes in Mandarin.

2751
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:16,450
So, when they say some words that I don't understand, I lose context for the entire sentence.

2752
01:52:16,590 --> 01:52:18,130
So, I was so confused.

2753
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:20,050
I was like, what do you, I, what?

2754
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:23,090
What is she saying to me?

2755
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:25,550
But, yeah, the staff paid for my meals.

2756
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:28,370
Even when I was going out by myself to eat, which was super nice.

2757
01:52:28,470 --> 01:52:31,450
I was like, yay, free food.

2758
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:33,150
Yippee.

2759
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:37,750
Yay.

2760
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:46,510
What other, what other, uh, what other stuff happened?

2761
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:49,090
Um, oh my god.

2762
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:50,250
And one of them have a corgi.

2763
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:51,670
They showed me their corgi.

2764
01:52:51,790 --> 01:52:53,270
I sat in a car with their corgi.

2765
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,030
It was so cute.

2766
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:55,910
He was, like, 12 years old.

2767
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:57,850
And his name is, like, Pansu.

2768
01:52:58,090 --> 01:52:59,390
Or, I think, I don't know.

2769
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:01,830
I don't, actually, why did you doxing her dog, Doki?

2770
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:02,310
I don't know.

2771
01:53:02,410 --> 01:53:04,230
I'm pretty sure that's not his name either, too.

2772
01:53:04,630 --> 01:53:06,110
Ha ha ha ha.

2773
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:07,090
Ha ha ha ha.

2774
01:53:08,670 --> 01:53:11,830
Look, look, I'm pretty sure I don't even actually remember his name.

2775
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:12,570
I was drunk.

2776
01:53:12,570 --> 01:53:13,430
I had beer.

2777
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:21,390
I just, I was, I had, like, a dinner with, like, some of the staff members.

2778
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:24,270
Like, they were treating, like, we were drinking beer and everything.

2779
01:53:24,270 --> 01:53:26,050
I'm not, I was, like, drunk.

2780
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:28,210
I don't even think I remember the dog's name.

2781
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:30,010
I just made up a name for him.

2782
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:31,030
Ha ha ha ha.

2783
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:33,610
But I remember he was 12 years old.

2784
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:35,350
Because I was like, holy shit, he's old.

2785
01:53:35,670 --> 01:53:36,150
Oh!

2786
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:36,950
Wait.

2787
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:45,390
Oh, we, like, um, the staff members, like, one of the staff members' husband was feeding some stray cats, like, the meat that we were eating.

2788
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:47,650
Like, we had, like, takeout for some of the meat.

2789
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:48,470
Okay, wait.

2790
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:50,330
Um.

2791
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:54,770
Um, let me see if I could find it.

2792
01:53:54,810 --> 01:53:57,110
I was like, oh my god, look at him go.

2793
01:53:57,310 --> 01:54:02,510
But this is, like, this is one of the staff members' husband, um, like, feeding the stray cat.

2794
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:03,450
Let me see if I can save it.

2795
01:54:03,610 --> 01:54:05,910
I was, yeah, I got a, I got a picture of it.

2796
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:07,170
Because I thought it was cute.

2797
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:08,670
I was like, look at that.

2798
01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:09,670
Look at that.

2799
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:10,550
Look at that cat.

2800
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:16,100
Let's see.

2801
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,240
Oh, this is a big picture.

2802
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:18,280
Alright.

2803
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:23,000
Alright, here we go.

2804
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:24,120
Look!

2805
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:25,520
Look at him!

2806
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:27,600
He's feeding the cat!

2807
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:30,500
There are so many stray cats here, by the way.

2808
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:34,460
There's, like, you're talking toxing this cat.

2809
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:37,200
We gave this cat fucking good ass meat.

2810
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:38,720
That's for sure.

2811
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:43,900
We gave, we gave this cat some good ass fucking meat.

2812
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:44,660
Yeah!

2813
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:49,180
There are so many kitties around.

2814
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:54,060
There's, like, a lot of campus cats, too, around the NetEase campus, too.

2815
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:55,240
Which is pretty cool.

2816
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:58,020
Um, whatever stuff can I show you guys.

2817
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,740
Oh, I'm getting a little lightheaded.

2818
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:00,580
I'm not.

2819
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:01,480
I'm sick, guys.

2820
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:05,100
So, I'm, like, I'm so...

2821
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:09,400
Oh, let me show you, uh, I've been talking a lot.

2822
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:11,020
I don't think I was supposed to talk this much.

2823
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:12,580
I literally woke up.

2824
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,520
I was, like, oh, no.

2825
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:14,940
Oh, no.

2826
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,480
I want to see my pandas.

2827
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:19,300
Oh, wait, here.

2828
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:20,680
Here we go.

2829
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,800
Here's, like, my...

2830
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:22,140
Oh, yeah.

2831
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:22,720
I forgot.

2832
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,400
Let me show you guys the LaBubu...

2833
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,780
The LaBubu outfit that they got me.

2834
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:29,860
My first LaBubu outfit.

2835
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:30,500
Look at this.

2836
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:33,220
Look at this.

2837
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:35,160
He has pants.

2838
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:38,560
This is my...

2839
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,620
I didn't put on my LaBubu yet.

2840
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:42,280
But they got me...

2841
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,780
They gave me a LaBubu and a custom Donkey Bird outfit.

2842
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:47,260
Like...

2843
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,880
It's for my LaBubu.

2844
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:55,460
It looks just like Donkey Bird.

2845
01:55:57,140 --> 01:55:59,380
The Donkey LaBubu.

2846
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,240
Yeah, they got me this.

2847
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,440
And then...

2848
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:03,840
What else?

2849
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,240
What else can I show you guys?

2850
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:07,720
Uh...

2851
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:09,600
Let's see.

2852
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:12,900
Uh...

2853
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:15,440
I'm trying to see what I can show you guys.

2854
01:56:17,020 --> 01:56:17,720
Oh, yeah.

2855
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:18,580
I'll show...

2856
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,740
Wait, okay.

2857
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:27,660
This is, like, the picture I took when we were arriving and being, like...

2858
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:29,900
When I was, like, arriving to Hong Kong.

2859
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:33,620
And I was, like, nothing's gonna get worse from then on.

2860
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:35,960
Everything's gonna go, okay.

2861
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:38,500
Little does she know.

2862
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,400
This is when I...

2863
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,460
I looked up.

2864
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:43,900
I was, like, there's Hong Kong.

2865
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:45,940
Surely nothing's gonna get worse.

2866
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:46,920
Oh, my gosh.

2867
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,180
I was so hopeful.

2868
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:49,900
Back then, I was...

2869
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:52,960
Filled with so much joy.

2870
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,860
Little does she know.

2871
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:02,400
Things are not gonna go okay for the rest of that day.

2872
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,600
Um...

2873
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,140
Last photo before disaster.

2874
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:07,020
Yeah.

2875
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,460
So...

2876
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:09,440
There's this photo.

2877
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,060
And then, uh...

2878
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:14,460
She doesn't know.

2879
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:17,660
She...

2880
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:18,420
Oh, yeah.

2881
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:21,000
By the way, the LAN is actually...

2882
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,820
This LAN, the background, is actually in the campus.

2883
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,540
This is in NetEase Studios.

2884
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:27,660
Um...

2885
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:28,800
So, like...

2886
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:29,360
Uh...

2887
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,240
There's no actual, like, audience.

2888
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:32,620
Like, I mean, there is audience.

2889
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:33,960
But it's, like, staff.

2890
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:35,740
Like, NetEase staff.

2891
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:37,200
Uh...

2892
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:37,540
Company.

2893
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:38,820
Like, the NetEase staff.

2894
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:40,360
Like, family and friends.

2895
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:42,980
And, like, other, like, invited guests and stuff.

2896
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,320
So...

2897
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,200
Um...

2898
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:46,640
Yeah, I peaked at getting the window seat.

2899
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:48,300
That was the best part of my entire day.

2900
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:50,000
Uh...

2901
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,780
So...

2902
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:53,820
And the entire LAN event is hosted within...

2903
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:55,600
One of the...

2904
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:56,760
Within, like...

2905
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:58,800
One of the floors of the building.

2906
01:57:59,180 --> 01:57:59,900
So, like...

2907
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,820
I was like, that's crazy.

2908
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:01,760
Because it, like...

2909
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:02,360
You know...

2910
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:03,860
That was so much production stuff.

2911
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:05,080
For, like, just one room.

2912
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:05,460
You know?

2913
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:07,500
Um...

2914
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:07,860
But, yeah.

2915
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:08,940
That's, like, the arena.

2916
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:09,320
Wait.

2917
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:10,540
And then...

2918
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:11,020
Uh...

2919
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:12,180
What else can I show you guys?

2920
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:12,840
Oh, wait.

2921
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:13,700
I forgot.

2922
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:15,900
I have a very important photo to show you guys.

2923
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:16,820
I forgot to show.

2924
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:19,180
I have a very, very, very important photo.

2925
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:20,280
Give me a sec.

2926
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,620
This is very important.

2927
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,640
I specifically requested the staff to get this photo for me.

2928
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:26,560
I...

2929
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:30,040
Apparently, there's videos, too.

2930
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,160
But they haven't sent me the videos yet.

2931
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:33,360
But...

2932
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:38,140
I asked the staff to get me this...

2933
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:45,800
That's right.

2934
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:46,940
Jealous.

2935
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:48,520
That's right.

2936
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,100
My Marvel rival wife.

2937
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:55,300
Jealous.

2938
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:05,320
You're my main.

2939
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:06,400
That's right.

2940
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,000
I got my main.

2941
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,280
Give me a kiss.

2942
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:10,960
That's looking great.

2943
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:15,540
But, yeah.

2944
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:17,420
They even got a video for me, too.

2945
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:18,220
Oh, yeah.

2946
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:19,520
So...

2947
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:20,360
You guys didn't see?

2948
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:23,120
See this photo?

2949
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:25,020
Only I got this photo.

2950
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:25,240
Okay.

2951
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:25,840
Not this one.

2952
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:28,400
But, like, all the other content creators got, like, a photo of the cosplayers.

2953
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:29,080
But...

2954
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:29,800
But...

2955
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,600
It should have been me.

2956
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:32,920
But this photo.

2957
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:34,060
This photo?

2958
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:34,720
Okay.

2959
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:37,880
Technically, I wasn't even supposed to get this photo.

2960
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:40,620
Because none of the content creators are allowed in this room.

2961
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:43,080
Like, none of the invited people, players, or whatever.

2962
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,960
They're not allowed in this dev room.

2963
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:50,200
Because this room where they take pictures or film the dev updates.

2964
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:56,600
You know, where, like, Wong Wong sits on the chair and be like, Today, we're gonna, we're gonna launch the patch updates and stuff like that.

2965
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:59,800
And the thing is, um...

2966
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:04,560
Um, if you watch the dev, like, you know, the dev update video, This is literally the same, this is the same area.

2967
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:06,100
But no one's allowed in there.

2968
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:08,560
Unless you're, like, a developer or, like, a staff member.

2969
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:13,760
Because the room is actually for, like, is, like, where they're actually working and stuff.

2970
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:15,460
Like, doing, like, updates and stuff.

2971
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:17,160
Like, working on the new Marvel Rivals stuff.

2972
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:19,560
So they didn't want things to get leaked, you know?

2973
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:24,340
Um, so, but the thing is, um, they let me...

2974
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:26,280
And the thing is, they have to, like...

2975
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:28,820
There's, like, desks originally on here and everything.

2976
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,600
So they have to set up, like, a photo shoot for this in general, too.

2977
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:34,040
So they have to move the desk around.

2978
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,260
And so they have, like, the perfect angle and everything.

2979
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:40,800
And so, I was allowed to have a picture.

2980
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,800
Because all I had to do was just give them the plushie.

2981
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:44,940
That's it!

2982
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:46,820
So I don't need to be in there.

2983
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:49,100
I just gotta give them me.

2984
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:50,980
I might give them the plushie.

2985
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:52,600
And they set this whole thing up for me.

2986
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:56,280
So I'm, like, the only content creator that got this photo because of it.

2987
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:58,200
Because I was, like...

2988
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,720
Yeah, I got the doki privilege.

2989
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:01,960
Because they literally, like, set up their...

2990
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:02,980
It's literally their office.

2991
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:04,260
This whole thing...

2992
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,400
The developer update is filmed in their office.

2993
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:11,780
And they have to, like, actually, like, move the desk and stuff around to take this photo and film it.

2994
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:13,960
Um, because I asked.

2995
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,740
I was, like, you know, the worst thing they can say is no.

2996
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:16,800
And they're, like, no, we can do it.

2997
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:18,480
We can help you get this photo.

2998
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:21,820
And I was waiting for so long, too, for this photo.

2999
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:24,460
Because that photo was going to be my big reveal that I'm here.

3000
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,240
So I was waiting for so long.

3001
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:29,880
This was my big reveal.

3002
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:32,380
This is why it took so long for me to tweet.

3003
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:37,340
Because this was the photo that I wanted to reveal that I was in China.

3004
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:46,800
So, you know, I had to hold on my trauma until then, until I got the photo.

3005
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:49,360
And I'm really thankful for the staff for setting that up.

3006
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:54,480
Because, you know, it was a lot of work, you know, setting that photo up.

3007
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:58,180
Because they even photoshopped the picture to look just like the dev update, too.

3008
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:59,760
To have, like, the lighting and everything.

3009
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:02,500
Like, this, apparently they photoshopped this picture for me, too.

3010
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:04,700
To make it look, like, exactly like the dev update.

3011
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:07,660
Um, you know, because when they're filming it, they do, like, lighting stuff.

3012
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:08,480
So I'm like, yay!

3013
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:14,660
So, yeah.

3014
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:15,440
Anyway.

3015
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:18,300
That's some of my stories.

3016
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,160
I have a lot of stories.

3017
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:20,480
But that's, I'm tired now.

3018
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,300
I've talked a lot.

3019
02:02:21,420 --> 02:02:22,860
And, like, I'm getting a little lightheaded.

3020
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,300
I'm actually, I was like, okay, stream for two hours and you're good.

3021
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:29,040
I'm getting a little lightheaded now.

3022
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:30,320
So I'm going to rest.

3023
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:31,540
Anyway, guys.

3024
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:32,560
My next stream.

3025
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:33,960
My next stream.

3026
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:36,200
I'll be back in Canada.

3027
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:37,080
Um.

3028
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:38,800
I'll tell you when.

3029
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,660
But that will be my next stream.

3030
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:42,820
And I hope you guys refilled your Dokium.

3031
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:45,060
And, um, that you remember me.

3032
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:49,420
And that wasn't a statistic, guys.

3033
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:50,060
Alright.

3034
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:54,340
I'm going to see some pandas today.

3035
02:02:54,940 --> 02:02:55,500
Yippee.

3036
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,260
Anyway, guys.

3037
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:59,440
I'll show you guys more photos.

3038
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:02,280
Because I didn't actually, like, look through my photos that I wanted to send.

3039
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:04,280
Because, like, I was, you know.

3040
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:08,220
I was trying to figure out how to get my skin suit to work for an hour plus.

3041
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:09,900
But, and yet, it didn't fucking matter.

3042
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:15,580
So, thank you all for the super chats.

3043
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:18,360
And the, the, the gifted memberships.

3044
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:19,060
And membering.

3045
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:19,500
And everything.

3046
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,920
I really appreciate it, guys.

3047
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:22,680
Thank you for subscribing.

3048
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:24,900
And, uh, I'll see you guys later.

3049
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,820
As always, everybody.

3050
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:27,120
Stay hydrated.

3051
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:28,100
Pause your check.

3052
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:28,860
Get them around.

3053
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:29,740
Get that blood flow.

3054
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:30,920
And if you step for me.

3055
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:31,780
Head to bed.

3056
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:32,980
Because you deserve it.

3057
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:34,420
I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

3058
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:35,520
Bye, guys.

3059
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:36,240
Bye.

3060
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:36,740
Bye.
