1
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,460
That's a fake-out.

2
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,540
You don't have a loop.

3
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
You don't get no loop.

4
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,240
You guys didn't notice.

5
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,660
Sorry, I had to close my door.

6
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,600
But I've been trying.

7
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,000
I've been trying to do... be more active on Twitter.

8
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,040
Being a content creator by tweeting out that I'm live now.

9
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,320
So that's why it took me a while to swap scenes.

10
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,760
But yes, welcome back to Elden Ring.

11
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,240
So it's been a while since the last time we played Elden Ring.

12
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,140
And I've forgotten all my controls.

13
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,200
What's even worse is that I'm going to go back to Controller.

14
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
And by saying go back, I'm going to relearn this game.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,940
But on Controller.

16
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,440
Even though I was playing on mouse and keyboard controls earlier.

17
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,920
So the reason why...

18
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,600
For those who didn't know.

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,480
Because I was explaining it in a non-Elden Ring stream.

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,060
The reason why I'm not playing on M&K anymore.

21
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,760
Is because after part one of Elden Ring.

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,820
My hands started cramping up.

23
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,700
Afterwards.

24
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,520
So I realized that I can't play Souls-like on M&K.

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,640
Because my hand hurts.

26
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,040
So I gotta play on Controller.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,060
I think it's just...

28
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,040
I think it's the movement.

29
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,800
When I have to...

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,600
I think...

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:20,920
I don't know.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,880
Maybe it's the sensitivity.

33
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,140
But like...

34
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,040
I don't remember which hand it was that started cramping up.

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,180
I think it was...

36
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,660
I don't remember.

37
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,560
I don't know if it was the keyboard hand or the mouse hand.

38
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,840
But something was fucking with me.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,840
Later on.

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,780
Because I didn't feel it when I was playing Elden Ring.

41
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,980
It started happening like...

42
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,660
After.

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
Like after a little bit.

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,080
And then I...

45
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,940
Like I was trying to play...

46
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,760
Like I think I was trying to play like Rivals or some shit.

47
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,640
But I couldn't.

48
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,760
Because my hands were cramping up and stuff.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,520
And I was like...

50
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,120
Like you know...

51
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,540
The worst part is that...

52
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,620
It doesn't cramp up.

53
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,520
I've done like 16 plus hour Marvel Rivals streams.

54
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,140
But I've never had like...

55
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,540
A cramping issue before.

56
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,000
And I've done like...

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,760
I've like...

58
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,560
I've had problems with my wrist before.

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,400
When I...

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,920
In Overwatch.

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,900
When I had to do like...

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,780
Six hours of scrims.

63
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,800
And then rank in Overwatch.

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,240
And then you know...

65
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,360
Obviously you shouldn't...

66
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,460
And then I had to do that like...

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,260
Back to back to back.

68
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,500
And my wrist started like...

69
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,140
Feeling really sore.

70
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,380
But I've never...

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,240
Like I've never had an issue with...

72
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,400
My fingers...

73
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,340
Starting to cramp.

74
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,620
So I don't know why.

75
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,600
But it's only happened...

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,420
In Elden Ring.

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,140
I've never had that happen before.

78
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,260
In any other...

79
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,520
In any other game.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,140
So like...

81
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,520
I was like...

82
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:34,620
Okay.

83
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,800
We're gonna play with controller.

84
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,960
Because I don't...

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,540
I don't...

86
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't wanna...

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,560
I don't wanna deal with that.

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,960
Party ball.

89
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,800
Thank you for the super chat.

90
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,080
Thank you.

91
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,580
Thank you.

92
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,140
Doki tweeting live now.

93
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,060
No way.

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,640
I know.

95
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:49,980
Right?

96
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,200
It's crazy.

97
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,220
Because I was like...

98
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,680
Oh man.

99
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,800
I should really...

100
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,680
Be more active...

101
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,180
On social media.

102
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,500
I've yet to...

103
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,860
Go to the stage...

104
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,460
Where...

105
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,480
Um...

106
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,780
Where I start like...

107
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,720
Replying to people.

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,600
Because like...

109
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
That's a little bit too much for now.

110
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,540
We're...

111
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,100
We're taking baby steps here.

112
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,400
Okay?

113
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,260
Like...

114
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,760
Ha ha ha.

115
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,180
That's a little bit too much energy...

116
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,580
That I don't have at the moment.

117
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,120
So...

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,600
We're gonna...

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,400
We're gonna take...

120
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,440
Little baby steps.

121
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,600
Like sharing that I'm live now...

122
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
Is like...

123
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,520
A giant leap of progress for me.

124
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,520
Uh...

125
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,540
Thank you for the super chat.

126
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:24,880
Thank you.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,500
Thank you.

128
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
Gave up on M&K so quickly.

129
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,140
Roller on Apex.

130
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,720
Thank you for the super chat.

131
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,080
Thank you.

132
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,640
Thank you.

133
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,140
Okay.

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
There's no like...

135
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,980
Life update or anything.

136
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,540
But I really want to talk about this...

137
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,860
Before we start with Elden Ring.

138
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,100
But like...

139
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,500
Uh...

140
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,200
There were like...

141
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,520
Apparently new updates...

142
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,000
On the new Donkey Kong game.

143
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,800
And like...

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,700
People are like...

145
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,240
Fucking...

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,940
Freaking out.

147
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,700
Because like...

148
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:45,980
There's...

149
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,060
They just dropped so much lore.

150
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,320
And like...

151
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,640
Lore and content.

152
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,200
That everyone's like...

153
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
What the fuck is this?

154
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,140
And so like...

155
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,840
Apparently in the new Donkey Kong game...

156
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,040
Uh...

157
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,640
Pauline is in it.

158
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,220
The thing about...

159
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,880
That...

160
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
Is that...

161
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,460
Um...

162
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,280
She's like a child now.

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,180
So like...

164
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,180
Everyone is like...

165
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,500
Super fucking confused.

166
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,740
Because...

167
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,180
Uh...

168
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,500
Okay.

169
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,220
So...

170
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,880
They're like...

171
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,120
Okay.

172
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,880
That makes sense.

173
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,700
Because the Donkey Kong...

174
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,460
That kidnapped Pauline...

175
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,540
Is...

176
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,140
Um...

177
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,580
Is...

178
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,880
Donkey Kong's...

179
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,060
Dad.

180
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,380
So like...

181
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,060
Cranky Kong.

182
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,320
So...

183
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,840
Um...

184
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,920
So like...

185
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,660
Maybe like...

186
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,040
You know...

187
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,000
That's why...

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,500
Pauline and Donkey Kong...

189
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,560
Don't hang out anymore.

190
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
Because his dad...

191
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,880
Kidnapped her.

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,340
And then like...

193
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,900
So like...

194
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,220
They're like...

195
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,700
Trying to like...

196
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,100
Figure out...

197
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,160
How the fuck does this work...

198
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,380
In the whole lore...

199
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,160
And like...

200
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,980
Timeline...

201
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,400
Of...

202
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,700
Mario.

203
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:40,880
Mario.

204
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,920
And...

205
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,700
So then...

206
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,060
But then the thing is...

207
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,500
They showed a...

208
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,840
Screenshot...

209
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,320
Of...

210
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,840
Donkey Kong's dad...

211
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,800
But he's like...

212
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,240
Super fucking old.

213
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,660
So everyone's like...

214
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:52,920
Okay.

215
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,500
What the fuck?

216
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,000
It's like...

217
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,460
Okay.

218
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,860
Now that's like...

219
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,120
Weird.

220
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,760
Like...

221
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,500
How...

222
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,060
Is this like...

223
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,980
An alternate...

224
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,980
Cinematic universe?

225
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,080
Uh...

226
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,020
Like...

227
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,880
Is this like...

228
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,980
Are we in like...

229
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,480
Are we not in the main...

230
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
Mario timeline?

231
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,580
Are we in like...

232
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,540
An alternate...

233
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:12,880
You know...

234
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,300
It's like Zelda timeline...

235
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,680
Like a little...

236
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,560
There's like a little fucking...

237
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,660
Time paradox right now...

238
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,380
Are we in like...

239
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,740
Some like...

240
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,560
Is this like a Zelda timeline shit?

241
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,480
Where like...

242
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,880
Every version of Zelda games...

243
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,240
Or like...

244
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,580
Legend of Zelda games...

245
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,300
Is like...

246
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,940
A different version...

247
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Of Link and Zelda?

248
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,520
Like...

249
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,220
No...

250
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,120
We don't know...

251
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,620
Like...

252
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,160
It just...

253
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,520
This entire new...

254
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,720
Donkey Kong game...

255
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,280
Like...

256
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,860
Um...

257
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,680
Ruined...

258
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
The whole timeline...

259
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,100
And lore of Donkey Kong...

260
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,040
Like, we don't know what's going on anymore in the DKverse.

261
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,100
So, like, people saw this screenshot in, like, the Donkaverse.

262
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:59,700
Like, it was, like, all our theories, all, like, everything we know about Mario doesn't make sense anymore.

263
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,960
Like, like, everyone's like, oh, yeah, it's Donkey Kong's dad that kidnapped Pauline.

264
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,580
And that's what, like, Mario is trying to save Pauline from Donkey Kong's dad.

265
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,140
And then now you're like, wait, but Donkey Kong and Pauline are working together?

266
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,040
And they're actually close friends?

267
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,120
But then, like, okay, so, yeah, but that makes sense.

268
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,880
Like, maybe that's why they're not close friends anymore, because his dad kidnapped her.

269
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:34,540
But then, but then, why is Donkey, why is Cranky Kong so fucking old in the screenshot?

270
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,440
Then who kidnaps her?

271
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:36,980
Like,

272
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,180
who the fuck is, who the fuck kidnapped her?

273
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,860
Oh, yeah.

274
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,960
By the way, Donkey Kong wears clothes now, because in the game, um...

275
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,860
In the game, they started, like, kink, like, sorry, kink-shaming Donkey Kong for being naked all the time.

276
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,820
Because all his, all the other Kongs wear clothes.

277
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,320
And then Donkey Kong wears, like, a tie.

278
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,740
And then, like, apparently there's, like, an outfit selection.

279
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,080
And then in the outfit selection, they're, like, Donkey Kong is naked just like the way he was born.

280
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,840
But then you can give him clothes.

281
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,040
Like, apparently his default isn't, like, isn't naked anymore, because...

282
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,920
Because he, he started, like, kink-shaming him.

283
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,570
He's...

284
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,560
Donkey Kong is a free spirit.

285
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,320
Set him free!

286
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,180
He doesn't need clothes!

287
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,440
But they called, they basically called him a nudist.

288
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,940
And I was, like, what the fuck is going on?

289
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,860
I, this, this new Donkey Kong game, like, it's...

290
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,660
It's, like, everything you knew about Donkey Kong is not...

291
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,380
Like, what's the word?

292
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:01,040
It basically, like, changed everything for all Donkey Kong fans.

293
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,280
Everything you know is gone now.

294
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,900
Also, apparently he can turn into a fucking ostrich.

295
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,140
And a zebra.

296
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,240
Like...

297
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,640
Like, what the fuck?

298
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm so confused!

299
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,320
Why can Donkey Kong turn into a fucking zebra?

300
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,400
I...

301
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,480
And he can fly?

302
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,140
Like...

303
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,120
Yeah.

304
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,860
Alright, yeah, I'll show you guys...

305
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,900
I'll show you guys a clip.

306
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,920
So, like, whenever...

307
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,900
I think it's, like, whenever Pauline starts singing...

308
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,920
He, he can turn into a...

309
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,320
An ostrich gorilla.

310
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,440
And I'm...

311
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,960
I don't know.

312
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,820
It's, it's...

313
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,400
It's really fucking cursed.

314
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,100
Like, um...

315
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,460
Like, look at the...

316
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,960
Okay, the ostrich gorilla looks...

317
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,980
It looks so fucking wrong.

318
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,460
Because the ostrich gorilla has, like, fucking muscles.

319
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,160
Like, he's, like, buff as hell.

320
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,080
And...

321
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,240
But then, like...

322
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,660
His wings are feathers?

323
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,700
Like, I...

324
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,260
Sorry, sorry.

325
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:07,600
His...

326
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:07,900
Not feathers.

327
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,020
His wings are fingers.

328
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,680
But, like, there's feathers, too.

329
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,600
It's so cursed.

330
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,920
I, like, saw a screenshot.

331
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,340
Like, I saw the video.

332
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,480
I'm like...

333
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,820
What the fuck am I...

334
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,580
What the fuck am I looking at?

335
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,620
I like how someone was like, that's somebody's type.

336
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh, but don't worry.

337
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:25,900
They...

338
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,140
They included...

339
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,300
They made sure to include at least one furry bait in there.

340
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,020
And I'll show you a picture of her.

341
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,840
You'll...

342
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,180
You'll know exactly.

343
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,720
Okay.

344
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,060
These are apparently the villains of the new Donkey Kong game.

345
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,320
And, like...

346
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,900
And I'm like, guess which one is...

347
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,600
Guess which one's the furry bait.

348
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,020
One...

349
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,600
Oh, yeah.

350
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,840
Their name isn't...

351
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,480
Her name isn't that.

352
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,700
So, okay.

353
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,440
Okay.

354
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,240
So, there's, like, a viral tweet going on where they're...

355
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,760
Okay.

356
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,820
They're like, oh, yeah.

357
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,680
I can't believe...

358
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,060
Like, these are the villains of Donkey Kong.

359
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,380
And then everyone thought that her name is...

360
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,480
I can't say it.

361
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,640
I don't have an Australian to give me a pass right now.

362
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,560
But...

363
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,700
Everyone thought that that was her name.

364
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,420
Because of this one guy.

365
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,260
Like, everyone got one guy.

366
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,880
And...

367
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Her actual name is...

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,340
Poppy Kong.

369
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,740
But, like...

370
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,820
If her name was like that...

371
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,900
If her name was like that...

372
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,280
I...

373
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,040
I...

374
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,260
Will not...

375
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,840
I don't know.

376
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,560
It really fits.

377
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,600
I won't be surprised if her name was actually that.

378
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,480
And I'll be like...

379
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,880
I'll be like, wow, Nintendo.

380
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,580
I never thought you'd be progressive for once.

381
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,820
Um...

382
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,520
But...

383
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,940
But, yeah.

384
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,240
Anyway.

385
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,480
Oh, so I'll show you guys the description of this.

386
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,100
I love this.

387
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,060
I love this description.

388
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,540
Uh...

389
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,460
And there's...

390
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,340
Oh, yeah.

391
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,920
Never mind.

392
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,720
Never mind.

393
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,240
Nintendo wasn't actually kink-shaming me.

394
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,000
It's like, it's okay.

395
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,060
Naked as the day you were born.

396
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,520
And there's nothing to be ashamed of.

397
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,700
So, apparently...

398
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,640
He's just...

399
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,980
He's actually just walking around naked.

400
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,200
Uh...

401
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,080
It feels like...

402
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,860
If you're the best nudist Nintendo...

403
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,540
Uh...

404
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,340
Why is it not default?

405
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,780
Apparently...

406
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,840
Apparently...

407
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,100
Him wearing pants is the default.

408
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,580
I mean, in the trailer...

409
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,320
In the trailer, it's all, like...

410
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,880
Um...

411
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,960
It's all, like...

412
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,300
Uh...

413
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,740
Donkey Kong with pants.

414
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,740
So, like...

415
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,800
I assume that...

416
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,220
Like, being naked is not default anymore.

417
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,880
But he has...

418
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,460
Alright.

419
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,680
But would you...

420
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:02,920
Okay.

421
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,340
But would you go out in public wearing just a tie, though?

422
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,600
Um...

423
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,580
Okay.

424
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,440
But yeah, that's...

425
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,040
I really wanted to talk about...

426
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,640
The new Nintendo Donkey Kong game.

427
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Because, like...

428
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,460
That...

429
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,340
Those up...

430
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,020
I don't know.

431
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,660
When they...

432
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,200
When I saw all the tweets...

433
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,520
And...

434
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,820
All the tweets and all, like...

435
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,460
Um...

436
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,860
The news about the new Donkey Kong game.

437
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,980
I felt like my whole world view was shattered.

438
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Like, everything I know just was not true anymore.

439
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,460
Like, I...

440
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,940
Like, I thought I knew...

441
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,020
I thought I was confident in my...

442
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,380
Mario Donkey Kong lore.

443
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,660
But apparently, Nintendo was like...

444
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,280
Was like...

445
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,900
Was like...

446
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,940
Was like...

447
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,300
Bam!

448
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,620
Dropped, like...

449
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,740
In a fucking hidden bomb that exploded...

450
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,120
And destroyed all the lore that we knew.

451
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,200
Uh...

452
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,060
They fucking flipped the table.

453
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,520
Like, I don't know...

454
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,240
Like, I don't know if this is the main timeline.

455
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,520
Or if we're in the alternate universe.

456
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
In the Donkiverse.

457
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,800
I don't know anymore.

458
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,160
Like, everything I know is a lie now.

459
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,660
Uh...

460
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,560
Yeah, I need like a Donkey Kong multiverse diagram.

461
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,500
All theories were wrong.

462
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,380
Goodbye.

463
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:28,900
Now.

464
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,720
Also, I ordered from Uber Eats.

465
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,200
I trusted Uber Eats one more time.

466
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,800
And I got really sad yesterday.

467
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,380
This is a sad update.

468
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,020
For my life update.

469
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,140
But basically...

470
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,560
Um...

471
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,080
Uh...

472
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,240
Basically...

473
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,340
What?

474
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,820
Oh, sorry.

475
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,800
I got a message.

476
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,280
I'm gonna put you on a cliffhanger real quick.

477
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,020
Uh...

478
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay.

479
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,560
Uh...

480
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:58,880
Alright.

481
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,220
Sorry.

482
00:15:59,580 --> 00:15:59,660
Okay.

483
00:15:59,760 --> 00:15:59,980
Anyway.

484
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,320
Life...

485
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,180
Sad life update.

486
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,540
I ordered from Uber Eats.

487
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,220
Because I was craving mac and cheese.

488
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,480
But I was craving like...

489
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,000
The homemade style type of mac and cheese.

490
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,200
Where...

491
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,960
They have like...

492
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,340
You know...

493
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,260
Chopped hot dogs in it.

494
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,140
You know...

495
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,420
You know...

496
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,820
The...

497
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,240
The...

498
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,600
You know...

499
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,500
Like the actual homemade style type ones.

500
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,800
And...

501
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,460
Um...

502
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:22,700
Like...

503
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,300
I don't know.

504
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,040
It's just a little...

505
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,580
Little plus.

506
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:24,880
You know?

507
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,520
Just a little...

508
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,300
Little like...

509
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,220
Just...

510
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,580
I don't know.

511
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,100
It just feels so much better.

512
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
When a mac and cheese have like...

513
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,020
The classic chopped hot dogs.

514
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,700
Anyway.

515
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,080
Anyway.

516
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,240
So...

517
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,300
Um...

518
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,800
Um...

519
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,560
I ordered it.

520
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,140
But like...

521
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,320
I ordered it where it was like...

522
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,520
Meat lovers combo.

523
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,820
So it would have like...

524
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
Pepperoni...

525
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,920
Chopped hot dogs.

526
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,580
And bacon.

527
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,680
And like...

528
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,320
I was like...

529
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,020
But what I was craving for the most...

530
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,300
Was the chopped hot dogs.

531
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,720
I got it.

532
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,520
And it had everything...

533
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,340
But the fucking hot dogs.

534
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,260
I'm so sad.

535
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,540
That was like...

536
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,240
The one thing I craved.

537
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,640
I was so fucking upset.

538
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,720
And hot dogs.

539
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,960
And pepperoni.

540
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,860
And bacon.

541
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,060
But where were my hot dogs?

542
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,960
I was literally...

543
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,520
That was the only thing.

544
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,480
If they didn't include the pepperoni...

545
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,640
If they didn't include the bacon...

546
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,200
I would have been fine.

547
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,300
I would have been...

548
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,520
So okay.

549
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
But no!

550
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,740
The one thing I wanted...

551
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,880
Was not there!

552
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,380
I couldn't even complain about it.

553
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,800
Because I was so hungry.

554
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,740
I was like...

555
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,780
Om-yum-yum-yum.

556
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,140
Maybe the hot dogs...

557
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,320
Are like...

558
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,960
On the side.

559
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,880
Like on this side.

560
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,580
And I was like eating.

561
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:38,980
I was like...

562
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,060
Where's the hot dogs?

563
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,180
And then like...

564
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,720
There was like...

565
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,500
One third left.

566
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,540
And then obviously...

567
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:43,940
I was like...

568
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,120
Wait.

569
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,740
There was no hot dogs.

570
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:53,280
So I like, I like fucking went to the Uber Eats app and I was like trying to complain and like take a picture of the food.

571
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,000
But then like, obviously, one third of it was fucking gone already.

572
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,380
So I was like, okay, like if I, if I take a picture of this, they'll just think I'm lying.

573
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,500
They'll just think I like, I just wanted a free refund.

574
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,740
Yeah, it was too late already.

575
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,400
I have one third of the fucking mac and cheese left.

576
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,300
So I was like, they'll just think I'm fucking lying if I took a picture of what I have left.

577
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,160
So I, I didn't get a refund or a complaint.

578
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,420
It was a little bit too late.

579
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,500
I was like, yum yum, maybe the hot dog is over.

580
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,540
I don't know, I thought the hot, I was, it looked really good and I thought the hot dog pieces were like, I was just missing it, you know?

581
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,680
I was just like, wow, I can't believe I would coincidentally just miss the hot dog pieces when I started eating.

582
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,720
I was like, maybe it's on this side.

583
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,980
It was like, om yum yum.

584
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,360
I was like, wait, it's still not there.

585
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,720
Maybe it's on this side.

586
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:49,040
And I finally realized after there was one third of it left, I was like, wait a minute.

587
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,180
There was no hot dog pieces in the end.

588
00:18:52,540 --> 00:19:01,820
I was like, wow, I can't believe they put all these hot dog pieces on the one side I didn't eat.

589
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
That's where my brain went to.

590
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,920
So I had that.

591
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,240
Also, Overwatch update.

592
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,740
I want to talk about this.

593
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,360
I want, I'm going to be a drama alert.

594
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,380
Sorry, I thought this was really crazy.

595
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,680
So I really wanted to talk about this.

596
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,140
But drama alert.

597
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,460
We're going to be a drama channel for like five minutes.

598
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,620
Because I thought this was absolutely insane and a little funny.

599
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,120
But also not funny because it's fucked up.

600
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,800
But like, I don't know if you guys remember who, I don't know if you guys know who Kefri is.

601
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,000
But back in the Overwatch days, he used to be like this Widow, Widowmaker streamer.

602
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,160
That all he'll do is just one chick Widowmaker.

603
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,300
He's an asshole.

604
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,820
But he has a lot of like drama associated with him.

605
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,660
And throughout the years of playing Overwatch.

606
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,500
Overwatch, it's crazy shit.

607
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,980
Like if you ever go into the fucking Kefri Overwatch rabbit hole.

608
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,780
You're going to find some fucking crazy shit.

609
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,720
I know a person that was in that Discord call.

610
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,200
Where they were reading out the DMs.

611
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,160
If you know what that means.

612
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,860
You know exactly what I was talking about.

613
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,860
When I say all of that.

614
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:28,560
Anyway, so, um, so his ex-girlfriend, um, like his ex-girlfriend, like they broke up.

615
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,620
And, um, that was, I don't know.

616
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,720
It was surprising, but also not surprising due to the person Kefri is.

617
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,920
And, um, and she revealed that he cheated on her with multiple Instagram girls.

618
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:50,740
And, um, what was fucking crazy was that, uh, apparently, um, he made her sign an NDA.

619
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,600
But by getting, by being in a relationship with him, she had to sign an NDA.

620
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,240
So where the fuck happens?

621
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,540
Like in that relationship.

622
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,560
And when they're broken up, she can't reveal anything.

623
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:21,180
And then, apparently, anyone that interacts with Kefri in DMs or privately has to sign an NDA to even interact with him.

624
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,900
And I was like, holy fuck.

625
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:33,360
Like, I was like, you cannot have a conversation with him privately, like in Discord or on Twitter, without signing an NDA.

626
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,320
That's absolutely crazy.

627
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,920
I was like, holy fuck.

628
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,580
But like, okay, it's sort of understandable because you got, there was so much drama leaks come.

629
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:56,760
Because I believe it's because there was so much drama and leaks associated with Kefri, that at that point, he was like, if anything gets leaked, he can legally sue you.

630
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,440
Oh my god.

631
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:11,120
Like, he got too many DMs leaked that now he needs to be sure that no one can ever leak anything from him again.

632
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,420
It seems like he has too many secrets.

633
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:24,140
No, this guy, he quit his job working for the CIA to become an Overwatch streamer.

634
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:31,840
Like, that guy, he like, I think it was like the CIA and like, some, yeah, he was, he used to work in the CIA.

635
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,000
So, yeah, that's why he does so much shit.

636
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:48,000
He quit working in the CIA to become an Overwatch Widowmaker one trick.

637
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,780
Um, I mean, like, do what you love, you know?

638
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,600
Like, like, chase those dreams.

639
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,080
The natural progression.

640
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,380
Of course, the dudes are fed.

641
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,500
Oh my...

642
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,940
Yeah, an NDA for you, girl!

643
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,260
Nefret is fucking crazy.

644
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,960
Okay, I can understand a little bit of this.

645
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:22,500
Because, I heard in the, the, the sports scenes, like, for basketball players, and like, um, for basketball players especially, because like, people, and like, um, football players, because they make so much fucking money.

646
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:33,680
Um, the reason, apparently, like, if you pay attention to basketball or like, American football, you will notice that a lot of them date, like, some, like, the same girls.

647
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:40,920
So, like, like, like, one girl would be passed around different, like, uh, basketball, NBA, and NFL players.

648
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,560
Because, like, they're, like, they're, they, like, sign NDAs when they get into a relationship with them.

649
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:56,640
Um, so, like, they always, like, they date the same person, because they, they already know the process of, uh, they already know the process of dating, like, a sports celebrity.

650
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,400
So, they don't, they don't have to worry about, like, her leaking anything.

651
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:09,140
So, so, like, you know, if she gets broken up by a different, by, like, her boyfriend, then she'll date another, like, football player or a basketball player.

652
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,580
So, like, they're, like, oh, you already know the whole process.

653
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,340
So, like, you know, you have to sign this NDA and that NDA.

654
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,900
So, and I know you don't leak anything, because you used to date this basketball player.

655
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,720
And I know you don't leak stuff, so I'll date you next.

656
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,000
Like, so, so, like, it's, like, a common thing within that scene.

657
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,220
But it's just crazy to hear, hear that in, like, I guess, like, in esports in general.

658
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,320
Because it's, it's fucking esports.

659
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,300
Like, it's, it's just, he's not even a pro player, you know?

660
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,460
Jeffrey's not even a pro player.

661
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,700
He's just, he's just a content creator.

662
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,000
So, it's weird to hear that in, like, content creation.

663
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,280
And, like, as a content creator, too.

664
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,740
But, but yeah, anyway.

665
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,820
Anyway, that's my drama alert for the day.

666
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,560
Let's actually play Elden Ring.

667
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,060
I just, I really, I just really wanted to talk about it.

668
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,480
It just blew my mind when I was reading about it.

669
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,840
Um, Peter, thank you for the super chat.

670
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,600
Thank you, thank you.

671
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,160
Imagine giving up a career in the intelligence community to be an Overwatch streamer.

672
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,080
Name a worse trade-off.

673
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,480
Okay, to be fair, at that time, at that time, he was the number one Widowmaker at that time.

674
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,460
He, he used to have, like, before, like, people realized he was, like, an asshole.

675
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,680
Like, okay, to be fair, on his stream, everyone knew he was an asshole.

676
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,500
But, like, he was really, really good at Widowmakers.

677
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,600
So, people were just, like, giving him the pass.

678
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,080
But now, now people were like, wait, oh my God.

679
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,460
You're a little bit weird, too.

680
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,220
Like...

681
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,940
Anyway, uh, guys, thank you for the super chat.

682
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,820
Thank you, thank you.

683
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,120
Wait, Doki, you do, you know too much.

684
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,040
Aren't you breaking an NDA?

685
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,880
Thank you for the super chat.

686
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,720
Thank you, thank you.

687
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,980
I was lucky enough to be one of the people who has never ever interacted with Kefri, personally.

688
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,480
Thank fucking god.

689
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:29,920
I have- I am one degree separation from- from Kefri, though, because I know someone who was- I know someone who knows someone- wait, no, two degrees of separation.

690
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:36,900
I know someone who knows someone that was part- that was in those DM leaks.

691
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,840
Hahaha!

692
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,480
The original DM leaks.

693
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:50,920
And I know more details about the first DM leaks than any of you guys know that I can never talk about in public.

694
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,120
Hahaha!

695
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,400
That was actually one of the people involved in those DM leaks.

696
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,680
I know too much.

697
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,420
And I wish I didn't know this information.

698
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,520
I- I- I don't- Toki, don't get near the window, Toki!

699
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,220
Um...

700
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,720
Toki, you have to avoid windows now.

701
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,900
Hahaha!

702
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:29,660
I- I wish- I didn't know some of the information that I know, because it's like- You know, it's like those types of info where you're like, why did you tell me this?

703
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,720
Like, I don't want to know about this.

704
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,480
Hahaha!

705
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:44,800
And then- And then- I also- know, like- Um, one of my friends have seen the pictures.

706
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,860
And then they're like- Hahaha!

707
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,500
They're like, I wish this picture was never sent to me.

708
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,620
Hahaha!

709
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:52,700
Hahaha!

710
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:54,680
Hahaha!

711
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,020
So- The pictures!

712
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,460
Uh-huh!

713
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay.

714
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,300
If you know the lore- the lore behind it, then you'll know- Oh no!

715
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:12,840
What- If you know the Kefri rabbit hole drama, then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about when I say pictures.

716
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,900
Hahaha!

717
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:15,660
Hahaha!

718
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,020
Hahaha!

719
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,120
Hahaha!

720
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,300
Hahaha!

721
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,280
Hahaha!

722
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:27,360
So- This is like the context for like- This is like- The people who are still- Who still remember ancient Overwatch lore.

723
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,120
It's actually like a throwback in history.

724
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:30,720
Hahaha!

725
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:31,960
Nitro!

726
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,260
Thank you for the super chat!

727
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,160
Thank you, thank you!

728
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,260
This is a wild start to this stream.

729
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,480
Thank you for the super chat!

730
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,300
Thank you, thank you!

731
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:39,640
Start!

732
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,680
Thank you for the super chat!

733
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,560
Thank you, thank you!

734
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,740
The pictures!

735
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,660
What do they- You don't want- You don't want- Hahaha!

736
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,200
Literally- The people- People who know the ancient hidden lore.

737
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,560
Wish they didn't know the ancient hidden lore!

738
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,020
Anyway guys, let's play some Elden Ring.

739
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,280
Um, it took me a while to boot up the game at first.

740
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,200
Because, it- For some reason, It went to my third monitor.

741
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:13,260
So like, I was trying to figure out how the fuck to get it back to my first mon- The third monitor, which is the vertical monitor too.

742
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,020
So it was like a little- Like, a little bit- Uh, A little bit troublesome to like, play on that monitor.

743
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,900
Um, Yeah, you guys are all like- The ones who get to live in blissful ignorance.

744
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,900
You guys avoided one of the darkest times in Overwatch history.

745
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,500
Uh,

746
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,230
It's- Clearly- It was pretty funny.

747
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,170
Okay, It was like- At that time, I- Oh my gosh.

748
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:47,270
When those messages got leaked, There were some wild fucking phrases in there.

749
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,530
Some wild shit in there.

750
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,830
At that time, it was pretty funny.

751
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,870
Because you're like, I can't believe he said that.

752
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,150
Coolen, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

753
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,570
These pictures sound cursed.

754
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,970
He let me know where to find them so I can avoid them.

755
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,330
Thank you for the super chat.

756
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:11,690
Thank you.

757
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,170
Thank you.

758
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:21,410
I'll just say that the original messages that got leaked had the pictures, but it was censored.

759
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:28,130
But my friend, one of my friends saw the picture uncensored.

760
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,450
That's all I'll say.

761
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,770
The ones that got leaked to the public were censored.

762
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,890
Oh shit, not my flask.

763
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,310
Okay, I need to know how to play this game.

764
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,570
Wait, did I boot up?

765
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,990
Okay, I thought I was in Night Ring for a sec.

766
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,710
Doki, please, I'm scared.

767
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,970
Please, he used to work in the CIA, Doki.

768
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:55,910
Stop!

769
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,930
That's okay, I live in Canada.

770
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,710
They can't get me.

771
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,850
I live in Canada, guys.

772
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,970
Alright, let's... I forgot to like put the game on stream... on screen.

773
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:11,870
Alright.

774
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,230
Okay, I need to remember how to play this game, guys.

775
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,330
I actually don't know.

776
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,870
Okay, that's the sneak.

777
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,730
I don't know how to play it on a controller.

778
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,770
Uh, okay.

779
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,790
Guys, how do I make it so like... okay.

780
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,770
How do I... okay guys, I have an Xbox controller, guys.

781
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:30,590
Okay.

782
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,770
How do I make it so I hold this sword to hand?

783
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,850
I...

784
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,150
How do I... I have... I'm on an Xbox controller right now.

785
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,630
Uh, Y plus RB.

786
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,110
Okay, that's not it.

787
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,440
Oh, I forgot I rebinded everything.

788
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,520
I thought that... do my things rebind?

789
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,200
Do my things rebind if I...

790
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,680
Okay, wait.

791
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,860
Oh, there we go.

792
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,860
Okay, operate.

793
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay, it doesn't.

794
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,480
Thank God.

795
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:05,820
Okay.

796
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,040
It doesn't rebind.

797
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,040
Wait, why doesn't it work?

798
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,960
Why am I not holding it two-handed?

799
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,240
Oh, I can't do it on the round table.

800
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:13,880
Oh, fuck.

801
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,160
Okay, I have to leave the round table.

802
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,080
Okay, I just gotta figure out how to leave.

803
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,620
Alright.

804
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,740
Where is safe?

805
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,680
Wait, what's that?

806
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,620
Where is a safe place?

807
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,900
Okay, we gotta go to the tutorial.

808
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,200
Is that the cave of knowledge?

809
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,100
Okay, there we go.

810
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,680
We'll go back.

811
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,720
We'll go back to the tutorial.

812
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,340
Doki, the CIA works outside of the US.

813
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,100
No, no, we'll be fine.

814
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,760
We'll be so fine.

815
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,540
We'll be safe.

816
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:46,540
Okay.

817
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,780
Alright, there's that.

818
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,720
Okay, and then...

819
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,420
Okay, two-handed.

820
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,680
Alright, and then...

821
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,320
Oh, shit, guys.

822
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,160
Guys, stop.

823
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,780
I'm okay.

824
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,820
Don't appraise yet.

825
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,680
So you can appraise me later.

826
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,060
I don't know why it still says mouse and keyboard.

827
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,640
What's this?

828
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,640
How do I do this?

829
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,880
Oh, okay.

830
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,740
That's how I do it.

831
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,080
Okay.

832
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,540
And then...

833
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,680
Okay, and then that's block.

834
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,920
And then...

835
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,100
And that's where I'll do that.

836
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,280
That's where I use the octopus.

837
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,180
Okay, and that's...

838
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,740
Okay, and that's my last.

839
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,820
And then that's jump.

840
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,620
How do I roll?

841
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,300
The f...

842
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,700
Oh wait.

843
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,420
Oh there it is.

844
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,860
Okay, that's how I roll it.

845
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:32,540
Alright.

846
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,440
Okay.

847
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,600
Guys, I figured it out.

848
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,240
It's been 64 years.

849
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,980
Alright, I'm ready.

850
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
I'm so ready.

851
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,180
Why does it keep saying E?

852
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:49,840
Okay.

853
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,880
Oh, I forgot.

854
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,300
I need to put my death counter on.

855
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:52,880
Give me a sec.

856
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:54,800
Death.

857
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,240
Alright.

858
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,460
There you go.

859
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,800
My death counter should show up now.

860
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,920
I think.

861
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,360
Where was it?

862
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,040
Was it this?

863
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:02,980
Oh, there you go.

864
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,820
Eleven deaths.

865
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,220
Oh, is it graphics?

866
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,080
Oh, okay.

867
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,240
Let's change our system.

868
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,840
Where is it?

869
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,360
HUD.

870
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,000
Where is it?

871
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,680
Where is it?

872
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,740
It's not eleven deaths!

873
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,980
I had to go to tutorials so I could live!

874
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,080
So I could be alive!

875
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,400
Okay, there you go.

876
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,440
I have to relearn my controls!

877
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,160
I don't want something to, like, come up when I'm trying to level up.

878
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,380
When I'm trying to relearn my controls, guys.

879
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,280
Okay.

880
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,480
Uh...

881
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,140
Where the fuck do I go?

882
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,520
Do I go here?

883
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,580
Where I killed him?

884
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,480
Oh!

885
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,580
Okay, we have to go...

886
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,640
To where I killed the lion.

887
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,220
Right?

888
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,180
Yeah.

889
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,200
I don't remember.

890
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,540
Was it here or do I have to go to the lion?

891
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,400
Where did I kill him?

892
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,500
It's been so long.

893
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,940
Did I level up yet?

894
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,400
Alright, let me double check.

895
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,280
Okay, I did.

896
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,260
Okay, that's good.

897
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,380
Alright.

898
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,420
I think it was...

899
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,020
Here?

900
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,440
Right?

901
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,820
No, that's the bridge.

902
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,680
Where the fuck did I kill the lion?

903
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,620
Do I just remember?

904
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,960
That one?

905
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,660
Right here?

906
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,100
Okay.

907
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,300
This is where I killed him.

908
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,180
Alright, I don't know how many bosses I'm gonna...

909
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,040
beat today.

910
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,160
Alright.

911
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,060
I remember how...

912
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,860
But at least I remember how to play the game.

913
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,700
Can you sprint in this game?

914
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,740
Or is that just Night Ring?

915
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,240
Here?

916
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah.

917
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,940
Here it is.

918
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,040
Hold B?

919
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,560
Oh, yeah.

920
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,260
Okay, I can.

921
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,020
It's hold B.

922
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,780
Oh, wait.

923
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,680
This giant's dead.

924
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,360
Who killed him?

925
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,040
Who killed this guy?

926
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,050
Let's go.

927
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,530
Okay, here we go.

928
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:34,590
Okay, here we go.

929
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,470
Is it worth killing him?

930
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,390
Is it...

931
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,770
Is it worth killing?

932
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,850
Oh my god!

933
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,010
Okay, there's several.

934
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:44,450
Okay.

935
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,670
Wait.

936
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,270
I can summon...

937
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,890
My little...

938
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,350
Oh, whoops.

939
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:50,710
Sorry.

940
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,950
Oh, sorry!

941
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,810
Oh, I didn't even use that!

942
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,190
Okay.

943
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,270
Okay.

944
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,090
I can summon...

945
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,890
My little...

946
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:02,750
Okay.

947
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,330
Let me...

948
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,350
Okay.

949
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,990
Let me go heal.

950
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:07,590
Alright.

951
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,010
Let me go heal.

952
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,890
Okay, apparently they're not worth it.

953
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,630
Let me heal real quick, guys.

954
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,550
Let me...

955
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,170
If they're...

956
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,690
If it's not worth it, let me just...

957
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,090
Let me just heal real quick.

958
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:20,990
Alright.

959
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:21,870
Now.

960
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,450
It's rewind time.

961
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,370
It's...

962
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,790
It's rewind time.

963
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,430
It's...

964
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:32,450
It's rewind time.

965
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,490
Tactical...

966
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,610
Reposition.

967
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,730
Yeah, but like...

968
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,830
Now they'll be asleep again, guys.

969
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,930
They'll be asleep.

970
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,250
That's what we wanted.

971
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,450
Now that they're asleep, I can make my move.

972
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,210
Alright.

973
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,070
Full reset.

974
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,310
It's like nothing happened.

975
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:52,690
Oh my god.

976
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,030
Oh my god.

977
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,490
Oh my god.

978
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,790
What the fuck?!

979
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,030
Oh my god.

980
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:00,650
There's so many.

981
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,650
Oh my god.

982
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,410
There's so many.

983
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,790
Oh my god.

984
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:03,830
Oh my god.

985
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,050
Why did I go that way?

986
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:05,750
Oh!

987
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,170
Oh!

988
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:07,290
Oh!

989
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,870
Don't worry, I have a rock.

990
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,530
Okay.

991
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,970
Maybe I should worry.

992
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,070
Maybe... Maybe I should...

993
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,930
Alright, that's fine.

994
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,770
That's fine.

995
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,310
What's this?

996
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,010
What's this?

997
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,190
Examine.

998
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,870
Yes!

999
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,870
Goodbye.

1000
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,470
That's right.

1001
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,830
Can't get me now.

1002
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,210
Oh, I have a horse.

1003
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,670
I forgot about him.

1004
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,010
What was his name again?

1005
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,110
I forgot he existed.

1006
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,910
How do I summon him?

1007
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,710
Is that him?

1008
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:49,890
Wait.

1009
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:50,590
No.

1010
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,430
Is that him?

1011
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:54,830
Where is he?

1012
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,310
I forgot he existed.

1013
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,390
What?

1014
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,710
Bro, I've been, like, walking this entire time.

1015
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,210
I mean...

1016
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,330
Oh, I can't summon in here.

1017
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,810
Guys, I've been actually walking this entire time.

1018
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,590
Let there be wrath?

1019
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,390
Ah, you don't have the right...

1020
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,230
Right of what?

1021
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,670
Lack of information.

1022
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,710
Poor!

1023
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,430
Alright, open.

1024
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,770
That's right.

1025
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,530
The information was...

1026
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,690
Too poor.

1027
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,000
Something incredible.

1028
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,700
Oh, something incredible.

1029
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,540
What is it?

1030
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
What is that?

1031
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,200
Why is he 2D?

1032
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,560
Hello?

1033
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,240
What's going on here?

1034
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,320
Why is it always a liar?

1035
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,840
Wait, is there nothing...

1036
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,700
Important?

1037
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,170
I'm so confused.

1038
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,230
What's going on?

1039
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,870
Oh!

1040
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,210
Oh!

1041
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,190
I'm going up!

1042
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,190
Why are these black blobs 2D?

1043
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,140
Oh my god, this is the longest elevator.

1044
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,880
Wait, that means I can bait someone to come down here and then he'll fall to his death.

1045
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,040
Eh?

1046
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,360
What does it say?

1047
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,440
Time for head.

1048
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,520
Time for head?

1049
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,000
Wait, is it just head?

1050
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,580
Wait!

1051
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:55,940
Really?

1052
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:56,960
For free?

1053
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,380
Oh, hey!

1054
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,120
There's another grease!

1055
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,000
Alright.

1056
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,780
Let's see...

1057
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,980
Do I have any extra?

1058
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,000
Anyway...

1059
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,680
Oh, I do!

1060
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,260
Yeah!

1061
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,520
Wait, why is it 6?

1062
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,380
Why does it say 6?

1063
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh!

1064
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,860
Oh, not enough.

1065
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,820
I wasn't reading.

1066
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,940
I got too excited.

1067
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,220
I thought it meant I did have to.

1068
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,160
I got too excited, guys.

1069
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,540
Bloodsting, don't you dare!

1070
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,660
No necessary item ahead?

1071
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,880
Too high up?

1072
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,240
Oh my god, why are all these ominous messages?

1073
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,220
Oh...

1074
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,160
Oh...

1075
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh...

1076
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,820
Still no head.

1077
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,600
Oh...

1078
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,480
Okay, guys.

1079
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,680
Let me put my influencer build right down here.

1080
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,500
Let me...

1081
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,180
Ahaha!

1082
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,900
Ahaha!

1083
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,180
Ha ha ha ha ha...

1084
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,200
Ahaha!

1085
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,020
Ahaha!

1086
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,440
Time for head!

1087
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,560
Ahaha!

1088
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:26,960
There we go!

1089
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,440
I'm gonna praise this message.

1090
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,440
It's time for influencer build.

1091
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,160
Alright.

1092
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,220
If only I had chaos.

1093
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,480
Be wary of fingers.

1094
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,320
Oh.

1095
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,020
Restore the power of the great runes.

1096
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,180
Oh, Godric's great runes.

1097
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:53,640
Oh!

1098
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,020
Wait, that's the guy I killed!

1099
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,440
Finger.

1100
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,340
Oh, my God!

1101
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,940
He does have no head!

1102
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,180
Okay.

1103
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,170
Wait.

1104
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:23,910
Actually, no.

1105
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,450
This one.

1106
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,150
This is better.

1107
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,830
There you go.

1108
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,290
Right here.

1109
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,270
For anyone.

1110
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,050
Please.

1111
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:37,210
Please.

1112
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,750
Save this man.

1113
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,840
Gorgeous.

1114
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,140
Time for tranquility.

1115
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:49,640
Okay.

1116
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,400
I think this guy got baited.

1117
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,720
Where do I do it?

1118
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,020
Here.

1119
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,880
I am not gonna jump.

1120
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,440
Liar ahead.

1121
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,680
Guys.

1122
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,500
I feel like all of these is telling me not to jump.

1123
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,660
That's it?

1124
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,800
Oh.

1125
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,360
Just leave.

1126
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:09,980
Okay.

1127
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,720
Do a flip.

1128
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,000
Alright.

1129
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,920
I'll go back to the divine tower.

1130
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:19,740
Wait.

1131
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,320
Do I go back to where I killed that other guy?

1132
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,840
Do I just go back?

1133
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,000
Oh, my God.

1134
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,360
How far did I go?

1135
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,900
It's like actually TP.

1136
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,860
Do I just go back here?

1137
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,480
Okay.

1138
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,600
Yeah.

1139
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,500
This is where I beat him.

1140
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,260
Oh.

1141
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,980
I can see a rune thing?

1142
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:43,760
What's that?

1143
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,600
What's that?

1144
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,240
Is this great runes?

1145
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,100
Oh, there it is!

1146
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,040
That there.

1147
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,900
You can use...

1148
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,080
Oh.

1149
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,540
Oh!

1150
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,500
Nice.

1151
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,560
Raises all my attributes.

1152
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,060
Nice.

1153
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:57,980
Let's go.

1154
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,300
Hello, sir.

1155
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,260
Yes.

1156
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,040
You are.

1157
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,200
You're a free boy now.

1158
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,260
He gave you a sock.

1159
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:12,760
Yeah.

1160
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,280
Alright.

1161
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,300
You're a free man now.

1162
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,240
What's this?

1163
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,720
Silver pickled file feet.

1164
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,420
Anything that's worth buying?

1165
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,640
Material used for festering bloody fingers.

1166
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,220
Oh, there's like all the invasion stuff.

1167
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:38,740
Yeah, no.

1168
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,280
I don't trust you, dragoons.

1169
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,600
I feel like...

1170
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,060
Yes, I'll invite co-op.

1171
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,120
But I feel like...

1172
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,800
I feel like you will all invade me more than help me.

1173
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,120
Oh, this is mostly PvP?

1174
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,260
Alright.

1175
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,940
Let's go over here.

1176
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,720
Still no tarnish.

1177
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,700
Oh, well done.

1178
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,980
But just getting started.

1179
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,900
I know you dragoons.

1180
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,320
If I was a fucking god at Soul's Leg, I would definitely invade too.

1181
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,520
Behold, victory.

1182
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:15,720
Left.

1183
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,780
Oh, this way.

1184
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,080
Okay.

1185
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,380
What's over here?

1186
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,720
Seek head.

1187
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,520
Left.

1188
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:24,940
Okay.

1189
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:26,460
This...

1190
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,260
This way is left.

1191
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,640
Wait, but what's over here though?

1192
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,040
What's over here?

1193
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,000
But Doki, you can be better if you invade more.

1194
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,540
Yeah, I feel like, you know...

1195
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,760
I feel like you dragoons and playing Soul's Leg for maybe like...

1196
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,620
I don't know, five plus years?

1197
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,740
Like how...

1198
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,980
When was the first Dark Souls game up?

1199
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,040
I feel like you guys might have...

1200
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,760
May or may not have more experience in Soul's Leg than me before I could fucking catch up.

1201
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,260
Oh, left.

1202
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,420
Left again?

1203
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,940
I always left.

1204
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,840
It's been...

1205
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,820
Oh my god, it's been like...

1206
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,320
Almost...

1207
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,280
Fifteen...

1208
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,440
Yeah, you guys have been fucking grinding, so it's like for almost fifteen plus years.

1209
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,220
I don't trust myself against you guys.

1210
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,380
I have no confidence.

1211
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,360
Whee!

1212
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,560
Oh, is this a friend?

1213
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,480
Behold, fruit.

1214
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,800
Oh, it is fruit.

1215
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:39,520
Nice.

1216
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,670
Hello?

1217
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:44,430
Are you okay?

1218
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,990
Only eleven years.

1219
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,970
I know, Doki.

1220
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,830
It's so little.

1221
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,190
I just...

1222
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:02,330
I'm just a new player.

1223
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,410
Eleven years.

1224
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,510
Where the fuck is the secret passage?

1225
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,910
Then...

1226
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:18,610
Behold...

1227
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,610
Okay, I'm getting invaded.

1228
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,990
I feel like there's nothing here.

1229
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,550
I feel like I just have to go this way.

1230
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:26,990
Liar.

1231
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,630
Yeah, I think he's lying.

1232
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,500
Ah, comfort.

1233
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,320
Am I supposed to feel safe here?

1234
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,460
Oh, no.

1235
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,760
I don't feel that safe.

1236
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,040
Why did so many people die here?

1237
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,580
What happened here?

1238
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:51,860
There's...

1239
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,920
Everybody do a flip?

1240
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,480
This is the flip code?

1241
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,990
Like, was there a meaning I wasn't aware of?

1242
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,220
Oh, they were trying to...

1243
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,400
Oh, I see what they were trying to do.

1244
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,720
Oh!

1245
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,660
They tried to parkour.

1246
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,800
Oh, they failed the shortcut.

1247
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,560
I see.

1248
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,100
It was a shortcut they were trying to do.

1249
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,260
Oh, there's a grease here.

1250
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,220
Little lemons.

1251
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,200
They're like, I saw this on a YouTube video once.

1252
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,500
I could do it, too.

1253
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,360
Where do I go?

1254
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,380
It's your turn.

1255
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,080
They failed to get the beef.

1256
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,420
Oh, is this my goat?

1257
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,820
Oh, there he is.

1258
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,520
Oh, my God.

1259
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,360
No, I ruined my no-goat speedrun.

1260
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,640
No!

1261
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,260
My speedrun!

1262
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,920
It's ruined!

1263
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,920
My no-goat speedrun!

1264
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,310
Oh, nice.

1265
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,250
I got a secret tier.

1266
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,030
Wait, who are you?

1267
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,800
Okay, now I gotta restart.

1268
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:18,940
Yeah, that's me.

1269
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,760
Then, perhaps you could spare some runes.

1270
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,180
Believe it or not, I studied blinstone sorceries at the Academy of Rhea Lucaria.

1271
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:33,100
For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.

1272
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,040
What does he want?

1273
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,320
Do I have ten runes?

1274
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,420
What are runes again?

1275
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,580
Is it worth it?

1276
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,480
I don't even think I have ten runes.

1277
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,860
Oh, my solos.

1278
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,460
Oh, I have ten solos.

1279
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,480
That's pretty cheap.

1280
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,020
Oh.

1281
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,120
He's asking for ten cents.

1282
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,420
Or you could step on a rat and get ten runes.

1283
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,500
If I study...

1284
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,360
If you want to play magic, you can learn a bit.

1285
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,600
Do I need magic?

1286
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,820
No, magic is for pussies.

1287
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,300
Yeah, magic's for the fucking weak.

1288
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:18,620
Yeah!

1289
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,220
You know what?

1290
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,380
I'll even kill...

1291
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,920
What if I kill him?

1292
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:24,760
You know what?

1293
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,300
I'll show you how much I don't need...

1294
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,140
What if I just kill him now?

1295
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:31,980
I...

1296
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,480
Whoa!

1297
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,620
Save the archer.

1298
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,120
I'll show you what I feel about magic.

1299
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:37,820
Whoa!

1300
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,140
Now, hold on.

1301
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,200
Optional, but...

1302
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,880
Don't kill him.

1303
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:48,500
He's...

1304
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,140
Whoa!

1305
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,100
Stop!

1306
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:50,680
Whoa!

1307
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,360
Whoa!

1308
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,400
Whoa!

1309
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,000
Alright, let's see.

1310
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:57,600
I got...

1311
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,860
I saw...

1312
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,920
I saw the speedrunners with magic.

1313
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,340
I...

1314
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,460
I know what they did.

1315
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,400
You...

1316
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:06,760
Oh!

1317
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:07,300
Yeah!

1318
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:07,680
Oh!

1319
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,380
That's it!

1320
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,860
I don't like being called a coward!

1321
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,240
I'm going back!

1322
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,480
That's right!

1323
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,200
You tried to rage bait, and you rage baited successfully!

1324
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,320
I'm coming!

1325
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,360
No!

1326
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,240
Alright!

1327
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,860
Wait, what does this say?

1328
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,060
Wait, no.

1329
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,280
I wanna read what this says.

1330
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,120
Alright!

1331
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,020
Give me a reason why I should spare his life!

1332
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,980
Right now!

1333
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,180
Don't!

1334
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:40,980
Oh, thank you.

1335
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:41,860
That's enough reason.

1336
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,380
Money is enough reason.

1337
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,340
Bye, Talon!

1338
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,100
Thank you for the super chat!

1339
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:47,680
Thank you!

1340
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,440
Thank you!

1341
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:48,920
Thank you!

1342
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,800
Your lucky money is enough reason.

1343
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,620
Oh, shit!

1344
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,480
Alright, nice.

1345
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,680
What's that?

1346
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,860
Is that gonna explode?

1347
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,160
Oh!

1348
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,600
I have to double kill him!

1349
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,120
Mike, thank you for the super chat!

1350
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:11,540
Thank you!

1351
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,260
Thank you!

1352
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,080
Do it!

1353
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,060
Zyko!

1354
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:14,960
Thank you for the super chat!

1355
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:15,300
Thank you!

1356
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:15,820
Thank you!

1357
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,040
Back in my day!

1358
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:17,720
Old days!

1359
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,740
Magic invasion!

1360
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,300
Especially Moonville!

1361
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,040
Thank you for the super chat!

1362
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:22,320
Thank you!

1363
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:22,900
Thank you!

1364
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:23,880
How did you die?

1365
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:25,840
Oh!

1366
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:27,640
Oh!

1367
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:27,780
Oh!

1368
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,140
I see!

1369
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,280
Oh, I see!

1370
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:33,740
Oh!

1371
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,340
Oh, fuck!

1372
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,720
Okay, I see now.

1373
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,920
Wait, can I, like, hit that?

1374
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,680
Or do I have to dodge?

1375
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,160
Okay, is there a range, though?

1376
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,830
Okay, watch this.

1377
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:55,390
Nice!

1378
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,670
Oh, wait, I should double kill him, just in case.

1379
00:53:58,670 --> 00:53:59,130
Wait.

1380
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:01,890
Get out of here!

1381
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:03,530
Get out of here!

1382
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,150
What the fuck?!

1383
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,110
I said GET OUT!

1384
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:10,710
Okay.

1385
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:12,290
There we go.

1386
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:13,870
There's a double kill.

1387
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,510
I guess that was a bleed.

1388
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,810
How come you screwed up?

1389
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:20,270
Where do I go?

1390
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,050
I forgot about locking on.

1391
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,080
Alright, nobody did a flip here.

1392
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,500
Except for this guy.

1393
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,630
What the fuck?

1394
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:39,630
Is that another shortcut?

1395
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:40,110
Oh!

1396
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,510
That's another shortcut.

1397
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:44,950
Do I do a flip here?

1398
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,960
Yeah, but do I go up, though?

1399
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:58,580
Alright.

1400
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,840
Is that...

1401
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,260
I'm okay.

1402
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,790
I'm okay.

1403
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,590
Where's the river?

1404
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,130
Where's the river?

1405
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:29,210
I did something that no one else could do, chat.

1406
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:30,110
I'm gaming.

1407
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,170
Wait, what's over there?

1408
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,450
Never punish.

1409
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:35,650
Do I go up here?

1410
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,670
I think we're going down now.

1411
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:44,750
Look at that.

1412
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,310
I'm a natural parkourer.

1413
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,170
Wait, I don't know which way to go.

1414
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,070
I go up here.

1415
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:49,910
Yes, you go there.

1416
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:50,290
Okay.

1417
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:51,650
I couldn't tell.

1418
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,730
Do it again!

1419
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,030
Guys, I think I'm at one life now.

1420
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:01,710
I...

1421
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,170
I think...

1422
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,350
I'm pretty sure I'm on one life now.

1423
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,090
Is he gonna do a walk forward?

1424
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,750
My eight lives are gone after that one jump.

1425
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,250
Wait, he has magic?

1426
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,370
Fucking pussy.

1427
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,690
What the fuck, you pussy?!

1428
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,930
Oh my god!

1429
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,670
Get out of here.

1430
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,170
Can't believe it!

1431
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,370
You brought a sword!

1432
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,070
I thought you were a real man!

1433
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,190
That's it!

1434
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:39,370
Okay.

1435
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,520
Fine, I got it.

1436
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:45,660
Alright.

1437
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,640
Nice.

1438
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,260
The magic rock.

1439
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,940
Is there another one?

1440
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,020
Okay.

1441
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,440
I'll do it one by one.

1442
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,200
Get over here.

1443
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,560
That's fucking right.

1444
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,320
Get over here.

1445
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,960
Slowly walk up towards me.

1446
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,560
That's fucking right.

1447
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,420
Come on.

1448
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,580
Come on, a little too slow.

1449
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,400
Okay, you're...

1450
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,600
Okay, stuck by a jar.

1451
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,540
Okay, now I definitely know you're not a threat.

1452
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:13,620
Oh shit!

1453
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,020
Alright.

1454
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,600
Okay, he is, like, blocked by a jar.

1455
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,820
Like, he is not a threat.

1456
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,540
Alright.

1457
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,220
Nice.

1458
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,700
Okay.

1459
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,000
Come on, swing that sword.

1460
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,400
Come on!

1461
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,300
That's right!

1462
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,360
Come on, swing that sword again!

1463
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,040
That's right!

1464
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,400
My turn!

1465
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,200
My turn!

1466
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:39,720
Oh!

1467
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,680
Get out of here!

1468
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:44,860
Nice!

1469
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,900
Hey guys, thank you for the super chat!

1470
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,760
Thank you, thank you!

1471
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,720
Do it!

1472
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:49,840
Do it!

1473
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:51,300
Do it!

1474
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,240
Alright, I guess I go forward.

1475
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,460
Uh, not-so-deadful!

1476
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,060
Oh, hey!

1477
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,120
There's that guy.

1478
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,700
Oh, I could've just...

1479
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,280
I could've got backstabbed.

1480
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,040
I'm pretty sure.

1481
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,660
Behold, Rump.

1482
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,860
Uh, by the way, Doki, if you ever want easier from soft games with sexy robots, you should check out Armored Core.

1483
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,100
It's the most accessible, but Last Raven is the easiest one.

1484
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:15,960
Thank you for the super chat.

1485
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:16,780
Thank you, thank you!

1486
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,200
Visions are plump.

1487
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,760
One day.

1488
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,240
One day.

1489
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,180
Alright, let's head this way.

1490
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,060
What's that over there?

1491
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,560
Oh, is this a river?

1492
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,640
That people told me to follow?

1493
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,180
There's a grace here.

1494
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,980
Wait, who was that guy fighting?

1495
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,400
There was a- there was something that guy was fighting.

1496
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,840
Who the fuck was he fighting?

1497
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:50,460
Wait.

1498
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,080
Oh, is that- Oh, I should do that, right?

1499
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,020
When the fuck did I get Sacred Tear?

1500
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,640
Did I use it?

1501
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,680
I don't know when I- Oh, in the church?

1502
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,120
Oh!

1503
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,000
Okay.

1504
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:09,680
Alright.

1505
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,980
I don't know if I'm, like, accidentally using something I shouldn't.

1506
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,320
Oh, is he trying to kill this po- this merchant?

1507
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,620
This- This small business owner?

1508
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,960
Oh, hey, nice.

1509
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:24,900
It's really a butterfly.

1510
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,720
I can't believe it!

1511
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,500
He's trying to kill this small business owner!

1512
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,720
Don't you take a look at my wares?

1513
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,460
Oh, but...

1514
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:44,720
Don't ask me how I got my hands on them, eh?

1515
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,780
Don't worry, I'm also a murderer.

1516
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:50,820
Uh...

1517
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,780
Oh, I need that.

1518
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:52,860
Do I have one yet?

1519
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,220
Do I have a lantern?

1520
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,920
I'm always blind.

1521
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,360
I feel like I don't.

1522
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,420
Oh, I need that!

1523
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,100
Yeah, I'll get the lantern.

1524
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,660
Yeah, I feel like I should.

1525
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,320
Oh, lantern crafting kit?

1526
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,060
Oh, I'm too- Wait, I don't know what it is, but I'm too poor for that.

1527
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,880
Alright, equipment.

1528
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,200
Where the fuck's my lantern?

1529
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,860
How the fuck do I equip that?

1530
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:30,950
Put it on here?

1531
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:32,930
No, that's not it.

1532
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:34,570
It has to be inventory, then.

1533
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:35,730
Oh, there you go.

1534
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:36,630
Use.

1535
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:39,710
Nice.

1536
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:43,310
Alright, I don't know if it'll always be there, but...

1537
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,890
Oh, should I put it on my hotbar?

1538
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,910
Oh, I could!

1539
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,910
Let me try that.

1540
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,150
Uh...

1541
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,190
I don't want to put it on my hotbar.

1542
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,010
Oh, there it is.

1543
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:56,370
Uh...

1544
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:57,630
Wait, what?

1545
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,090
Oh, switch.

1546
01:00:59,230 --> 01:00:59,610
There you go.

1547
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:00,290
Wait, no.

1548
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:01,770
There you go.

1549
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,500
You just follow this river?

1550
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:09,940
Hey.

1551
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,260
Did I steal your horse?

1552
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,700
First off, here.

1553
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,220
And then try a horse.

1554
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,180
Oh, what's up here?

1555
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,190
Alright, come over here, horse.

1556
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,190
What's up here?

1557
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:33,870
Where do I get up here?

1558
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:34,770
Oh my god.

1559
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,010
Oh.

1560
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:39,650
Oh my god.

1561
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,890
Horse parkour.

1562
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,670
One of the hardest parkours out there.

1563
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:43,370
But don't worry.

1564
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,110
I'm a natural.

1565
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:49,210
If only I had ladder.

1566
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:53,870
Wait, what do you mean wasted time?

1567
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,320
Oh, no.

1568
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:01,700
I'm okay.

1569
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,220
Okay, I'm not gonna try that again.

1570
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:03,840
I...

1571
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,120
I don't think I'll try that again, guys.

1572
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,060
I don't think...

1573
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,680
I don't think that was worth it.

1574
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:13,520
What?

1575
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,440
Oh my god!

1576
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,320
My horse!

1577
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,380
Oh!

1578
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:19,940
Please!

1579
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,980
Someone embrace new head!

1580
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,280
Thank you.

1581
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,220
There you go.

1582
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,920
Nothing to worry about.

1583
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,700
Nothing to worry about, guys.

1584
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,060
Nice.

1585
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:36,980
I got a map.

1586
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:37,940
I...

1587
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,180
The fu...

1588
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,640
First off, map.

1589
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:42,980
Where is this?

1590
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,760
We're fine.

1591
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:46,520
We're fine.

1592
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,120
Everything is fine.

1593
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,880
The heroes.

1594
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,320
There you go.

1595
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,320
My best build.

1596
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,420
Hey, what is he ringing for?

1597
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,260
Oh, shit!

1598
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,660
Oh, that's what he's ringing.

1599
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,060
Oh, that's what he's ringing.

1600
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,620
He's ringing for it.

1601
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,540
Okay.

1602
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:09,840
That's fine.

1603
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,280
That's fine.

1604
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,260
That's right.

1605
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,440
No magic here.

1606
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,060
I kill all magic users.

1607
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,840
Alright, let's grab this.

1608
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:22,480
Okay.

1609
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,180
I don't know why it does these mini setters.

1610
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,020
I wonder if you could fix that, chat.

1611
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,180
This is a little annoying.

1612
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:35,120
It doesn't happen often, but it does get a little annoying.

1613
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:40,690
Alright.

1614
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,160
Oh, my flash?

1615
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,580
Oh, wait!

1616
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,640
What happened to my flash?

1617
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,260
Wait a minute.

1618
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,460
Wait a minute.

1619
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,260
Wait.

1620
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:00,500
Wait.

1621
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,340
What happened to my...

1622
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,240
Wait a minute.

1623
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,240
Wait.

1624
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,580
What did I bind my fucking...

1625
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:06,340
Oh!

1626
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,360
So dumb.

1627
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:10,740
Oh, my God.

1628
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:11,480
Wait.

1629
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:12,900
Oh, no.

1630
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:13,640
Not the bear.

1631
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,320
I was like...

1632
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:15,980
There's no way.

1633
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,040
When the fuck did I use the ball of my flash?

1634
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,560
It's over there.

1635
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,900
What the fuck?

1636
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:24,660
Where were you?

1637
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,180
Oh, my God.

1638
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:27,860
You fucking whore.

1639
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,740
He was like...

1640
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,480
I like how he, like, waited for me to, like...

1641
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,380
Figure out how...

1642
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,600
Do I fight that guy?

1643
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,960
Is it worth it?

1644
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:43,330
Yeah?

1645
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:47,370
You think he knows I'm here?

1646
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,030
No, right?

1647
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:51,850
Okay.

1648
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:52,490
Don't worry.

1649
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:53,150
I got this.

1650
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,510
Wait.

1651
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:56,870
Wait.

1652
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,070
Why is my...

1653
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:58,410
Wait.

1654
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,170
Why is my octopus buddy...

1655
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,710
My friend not coming over?

1656
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,670
Wait.

1657
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:03,510
What is he doing?

1658
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,630
What is he doing?

1659
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,470
Oh, my God.

1660
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:12,770
Okay.

1661
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:13,430
It's fine.

1662
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,270
It's fine.

1663
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,170
I got so confused.

1664
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,610
I was like, what the fuck was he doing?

1665
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:17,330
But...

1666
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:17,950
Alright.

1667
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:18,450
That's...

1668
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,170
Not as scary as I thought it'd be.

1669
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:20,690
I...

1670
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:21,470
No.

1671
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,310
There's no summons here?

1672
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:25,130
Okay.

1673
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:25,610
I...

1674
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:27,270
I was like, but he was on a horse.

1675
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,570
I thought he was more impressive.

1676
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,910
He was on a horse.

1677
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,910
I didn't know he was pathetic.

1678
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,650
That guy brought another player into the game.

1679
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:42,110
Oh, nice.

1680
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:42,890
I got a Firefly.

1681
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:43,090
That guy.

1682
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:44,570
Yeah.

1683
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,310
To be fair, he did have Aura.

1684
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:48,230
Alright.

1685
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:48,930
Grace time.

1686
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,640
Alright.

1687
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,820
Uh...

1688
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,720
Enough for level up yet?

1689
01:05:59,240 --> 01:05:59,700
No.

1690
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,420
I definitely don't have enough.

1691
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,040
Oh, nice.

1692
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:07,900
Another cookbook.

1693
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,100
Yay!

1694
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,380
Lobster?

1695
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,740
Is he a nice lobster?

1696
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,670
Hey.

1697
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,590
That's just too late.

1698
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,970
Where is...

1699
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,590
Good luck, buddy.

1700
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:51,090
One day...

1701
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:52,830
Strong foe...

1702
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:53,290
Ahead.

1703
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:54,470
Therefore, try tree.

1704
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,290
This tree?

1705
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,890
Wait, where is he?

1706
01:06:59,110 --> 01:06:59,870
Oh...

1707
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:00,950
Oh...

1708
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:01,350
No!

1709
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:02,270
Choice!

1710
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:03,630
Ahead!

1711
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:09,490
Aww...

1712
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,190
I don't know.

1713
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:14,030
There seems to be a lot of dead bodies.

1714
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:20,510
Aww, man.

1715
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,390
Bro, what the fuck happened to him?

1716
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,470
Bro, what the fuck happened to him?!

1717
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,170
Okay, what if I go this way?

1718
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:33,090
Should've he like...

1719
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,390
Oh man.

1720
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:38,690
Why go left or forward?

1721
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:41,530
I'm so scared.

1722
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:45,290
No, my chat died.

1723
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:46,370
My chat.

1724
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,930
How would I act?

1725
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:49,570
Okay, don't worry.

1726
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:50,210
Don't worry.

1727
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:51,430
Don't worry.

1728
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:52,830
My chat's back.

1729
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,290
Think of the loot.

1730
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:58,130
Wait, so I can't summon though, right?

1731
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,010
What the fuck?

1732
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,030
Where did he come from?

1733
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,570
Where the fuck did this guy come from?

1734
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,450
Excuse me.

1735
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,230
Okay, I can see you.

1736
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:12,430
My thing is locked.

1737
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:15,570
Get over here.

1738
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,750
Get over here.

1739
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:20,050
I can see you.

1740
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,530
I have locked targets.

1741
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,150
You're not hiding from me.

1742
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:25,810
Oh my god, please.

1743
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:28,270
Get out of here.

1744
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,430
Okay, nice.

1745
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,250
Just go forward?

1746
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:37,890
Okay.

1747
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:39,570
Yay.

1748
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,530
And brave Doki, it ran away.

1749
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:46,610
I'm so brave.

1750
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,350
Go left.

1751
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,510
There's loot.

1752
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:51,450
I'll come back.

1753
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:51,990
Don't worry.

1754
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:52,650
I'll come back.

1755
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:54,650
I'll come back to it, guys.

1756
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:55,630
I swear to god.

1757
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,850
And then she never came back.

1758
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:05,650
Don't worry.

1759
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,110
Don't worry, guys.

1760
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:06,990
I will.

1761
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,530
I'll be back there, guys.

1762
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:09,750
Do not worry.

1763
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:13,190
I'll make sure to come back for sure.

1764
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:13,250
I'll be back there.

1765
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,950
I'll be back there.

1766
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:17,770
Hello.

1767
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:20,850
Hello.

1768
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:21,790
Hello.

1769
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:21,810
Hi.

1770
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:21,810
Hi.

1771
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:22,030
Maiden!

1772
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:23,310
Over here.

1773
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:24,070
Hello.

1774
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:24,970
Hi.

1775
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:25,110
Hi.

1776
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:27,050
It's rather chilly here, isn't it?

1777
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:29,690
My mistress sent me off on an errand.

1778
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:31,410
There's more than one maiden?

1779
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,430
By a ruffian.

1780
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,310
But you're blind?

1781
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:35,430
Don't worry.

1782
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:36,790
I'm very hot and sexy.

1783
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,430
The hottest man you've ever seen.

1784
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:43,850
Uh-huh.

1785
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:45,610
What's up with your posture?

1786
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,350
That's some gamer posture right there.

1787
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:56,970
Hear the request?

1788
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:57,390
Okay.

1789
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:00,630
Oh, she said bye, not blind?

1790
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:01,610
Oh, I thought she...

1791
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:01,910
Oh, yeah.

1792
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,050
She can definitely see me.

1793
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:07,390
The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way.

1794
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,010
Yeah, she knows where I am.

1795
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,690
I must have the necklace back.

1796
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:12,710
Okay.

1797
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:13,730
Yeah, I can do that.

1798
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:16,770
Snake the head, but try love.

1799
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,050
Wait, she's a...

1800
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:20,250
Lovable sort of head.

1801
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:21,690
She seems pretty lovable.

1802
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:25,030
Doesn't seem like there's anything wrong with her.

1803
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,030
I'm a little lost now.

1804
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:31,050
I strayed from the path and I don't know where to go.

1805
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:34,630
I saw a woman and now I'm lost.

1806
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,810
Wait, where are the lights that are supposed to take me to...

1807
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:39,570
Where'd it go?

1808
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:42,610
Oh, my map.

1809
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:43,810
I forgot that existed.

1810
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:47,470
Wait.

1811
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:50,310
This is not helpful.

1812
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,030
Wait a minute.

1813
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,090
What the fuck do I go here?

1814
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,680
Oh, no.

1815
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,700
Where the fuck is the next map?

1816
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,360
Well, then.

1817
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,080
This way?

1818
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,160
Oh, hey.

1819
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,230
Oh, no.

1820
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:23,910
I'm off path.

1821
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:23,950
Yeah.

1822
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,750
I'm off path, guys.

1823
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,890
There's no messages to help me.

1824
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,530
I'm off-roading it.

1825
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,020
Yeah, but that's the...

1826
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,400
That's the girl that needed my help.

1827
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,300
No, these are my old arrows.

1828
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,000
I made those.

1829
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:51,460
I made those.

1830
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,520
I don't know how to take it off.

1831
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,180
See?

1832
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,160
One is like right over here.

1833
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,140
I don't know.

1834
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,920
Oh, I took it off.

1835
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,040
The lob.

1836
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,080
For some reason.

1837
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,720
I don't know why, but...

1838
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,980
I don't believe you.

1839
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,760
Look north.

1840
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,220
Okay.

1841
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,120
Okay.

1842
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,380
In your back.

1843
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,160
Go west.

1844
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,000
Nice.

1845
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:23,120
Oh, nice.

1846
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,540
There's invincibility frames there.

1847
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:25,160
That's good.

1848
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:26,920
I like that.

1849
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,820
Oh, my God.

1850
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,780
He, like, slapped me for his final death.

1851
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,520
Alright, get over here.

1852
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,440
Okay, but not like that.

1853
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,740
But, like, get over here.

1854
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,160
Come on!

1855
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:40,940
Get over here!

1856
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:42,880
Come on!

1857
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:44,020
Oh, shit!

1858
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,440
Oh, fuck!

1859
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,600
Not like that, though!

1860
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,240
Alright, it's okay.

1861
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,000
That's okay.

1862
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:52,440
I'm okay.

1863
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,460
Wait, I'm lost now.

1864
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:55,860
Oh, my God.

1865
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,860
This guy disoriented me.

1866
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:57,700
Okay, this way.

1867
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:03,240
This guy, like, fucking disoriented me, so I didn't know where to go.

1868
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:05,860
How did he die?

1869
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:10,890
The fuck you just stood there?

1870
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:12,570
Who killed you?

1871
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:14,550
Death...

1872
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:15,270
Oh, that.

1873
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,170
Okay, never mind.

1874
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,650
Okay, I think I might know who killed him.

1875
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:21,890
I think...

1876
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,470
I think I might know who killed this guy.

1877
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:26,630
Yo, Wes?

1878
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:28,690
Where's Wes?

1879
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,050
Oh, there's Wes.

1880
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,710
There's so many people died that way.

1881
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,040
Oh...

1882
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:50,530
I'm too scared to run!

1883
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:53,570
I'm too scared!

1884
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,010
Oh, wait, there's a...

1885
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:03,690
Yay, there's a grease.

1886
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:04,270
Let's go!

1887
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:05,650
Yippee!

1888
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:08,030
Never punish!

1889
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,670
Yippee!

1890
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:11,770
There's a shack!

1891
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:13,810
Oh, wait!

1892
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:14,650
There's lobsters!

1893
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:18,930
See, I told you guys it can't be that bad.

1894
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:23,510
What are you looking at?

1895
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,150
You trying to start something, mate?

1896
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,070
Give me the necklace.

1897
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:30,790
That necklace, what you're after, is it?

1898
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,640
Show me what it's worth to you, and I'll consider parting ways with it.

1899
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,840
Wait, what do I have?

1900
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,460
You don't have it or nothing.

1901
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:43,220
Dear.

1902
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,200
You're a shrewd one, Chief.

1903
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,880
First, you hand me the runes.

1904
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,880
And don't try nothing, neither.

1905
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,120
Wait, all my money?

1906
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:54,960
Wait, what?

1907
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:55,600
Oh!

1908
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,720
That's fine.

1909
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,800
How fucking bad?

1910
01:14:58,940 --> 01:14:59,780
It's just a thousand.

1911
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,280
Yeah, it's literally 1k!

1912
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,960
I killed one guy with that.

1913
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,740
Don't go crying to me later.

1914
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:13,780
Alright, nice.

1915
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,360
I did it.

1916
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:15,600
Did I break into your house?

1917
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,680
Okay, I just have to go back now.

1918
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:19,140
Okay.

1919
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,560
Oh my god, how do I go back?

1920
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,280
I'm just like...

1921
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,340
Where is...

1922
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,320
Where is home?

1923
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,800
I have a map!

1924
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,160
Okay, I just gotta follow this.

1925
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,240
Oh my god.

1926
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,120
The one time I remember I have a map.

1927
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,680
Map time, map time.

1928
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,020
Map time, map time.

1929
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:47,640
I have a horse.

1930
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,120
I do.

1931
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,340
I forgot he doesn't die.

1932
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:56,120
But he died like one time and I thought he was just gone forever for some reason.

1933
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,560
Oh, I could be his friend?

1934
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,700
I like friends!

1935
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:06,760
Alright, wait.

1936
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,820
I'll talk to her and then I'll talk to him again.

1937
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,500
I'll talk to her first.

1938
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,220
Oh, I have to get off my horse.

1939
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,160
The thug should be resting at an abandoned home, please.

1940
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,200
Oh, here.

1941
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,340
There you go.

1942
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,820
There you go.

1943
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:30,580
Thank you kindly.

1944
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,460
I am in your debt.

1945
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,900
Did I forget to announce myself?

1946
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,900
I am Raya.

1947
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:40,280
In the service of Lady Tanith of the Vulcan.

1948
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:40,620
Whoa!

1949
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:45,560
I seek stalwart tarnished, who might join our house.

1950
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,680
You are very brave yourself.

1951
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:52,040
Not only a steady hand, but a steady heart.

1952
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:53,530
Merciless.

1953
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,920
Even to your own kind.

1954
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,120
Wow, we have like the same posture too.

1955
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,800
We're so perfect for each other.

1956
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:01,560
Please.

1957
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,120
Take this.

1958
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,260
Oh!

1959
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,180
Okay.

1960
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,900
Grave tarnished.

1961
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,460
Seek the Altus Plateau.

1962
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:11,380
Oh my god.

1963
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,840
I got an invitation, guys.

1964
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,520
I'm going to go to a party!

1965
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,020
An exclusive party!

1966
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,460
Time to sign an NDA.

1967
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:20,060
Ha ha ha ha.

1968
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:24,180
But you are no ordinary tarnished.

1969
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:35,200
And once that is proven, the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation to fight amongst a family of champions.

1970
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,040
Oh!

1971
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,040
Wait, to fight?

1972
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,600
Wait, I thought this was a fun party!

1973
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,000
Not a death party!

1974
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,020
One more thing.

1975
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,980
Only for you.

1976
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:52,300
This land of Liarnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the grand lift of Dectus.

1977
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,280
Beyond the high road.

1978
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,700
Wait, this is like...

1979
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:59,500
It's like the island where they kill other humans.

1980
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,600
There's no simple means of passage.

1981
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,640
Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.

1982
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,600
At the base of the valley.

1983
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,260
Near the grand lift.

1984
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,540
Oh my god, this is exclusive exclusive.

1985
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,840
I have a fucking instruction on how to get there.

1986
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,840
Linking Liarnia to the Altus Plateau.

1987
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:20,500
I have faith in you.

1988
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,680
A champion through and through.

1989
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,060
I do hope...

1990
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,460
All I did was get you a necklace.

1991
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,420
How do you believe me so much?

1992
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,420
I didn't even fight for it.

1993
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:31,940
I just paid to win.

1994
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,160
Alright, time to...

1995
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,480
Wait, what the fuck is that?

1996
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,360
I don't know.

1997
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,900
What is that?

1998
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:41,860
What the fuck?

1999
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,660
I didn't see that before.

2000
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,340
Alright, time to go back to the house.

2001
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:55,310
I'm sure it's fine.

2002
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,250
I can touch it, right?

2003
01:18:59,350 --> 01:18:59,790
Alright.

2004
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:01,870
Time to find...

2005
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,130
Okay, the house is in front of me.

2006
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:03,530
Okay.

2007
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:04,990
It's crazy.

2008
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,530
I haven't found a single boss yet.

2009
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:09,310
I've just been, like, exploring.

2010
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,090
Do I have a grace here?

2011
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:15,070
Oh my god, I could TP.

2012
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:17,090
I forgot about the TP.

2013
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:22,570
Uh...

2014
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:26,310
It's not natural for me right now.

2015
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,550
Man, I'm so hungry.

2016
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:36,070
So very hungry.

2017
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:38,790
It's so good.

2018
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:44,230
Another price?

2019
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,730
You could be persuaded to sell you some other bits too.

2020
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:49,210
If you've got the runes.

2021
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:51,630
Wait...

2022
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:53,010
Purchase...

2023
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:53,550
What is it?

2024
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:55,270
Oh, it boosts physical damage.

2025
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:55,710
Okay.

2026
01:19:57,310 --> 01:19:58,450
So you met the girl, did ya?

2027
01:19:59,050 --> 01:19:59,890
Alright, well...

2028
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:01,910
Sod the particulars of the matter.

2029
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:05,350
But it ain't my fault she's stupid enough to get duped.

2030
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:05,950
Whoa!

2031
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:08,250
Anyway...

2032
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:10,890
She's just like me, for real, for real.

2033
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:16,530
I thought you guys said he'll be my best friend.

2034
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,000
How come he no friends with me yet?

2035
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,340
Do I just go west?

2036
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,660
Or west?

2037
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,180
So many possibilities.

2038
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,280
Oh, hey, Bandai!

2039
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:40,880
Why suffer...

2040
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,140
I gotta pay to be friends with him?

2041
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,960
Oh my god, just like...

2042
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,060
Just like real life.

2043
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,440
I can't believe it.

2044
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,420
Pay to win.

2045
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:55,940
Alright.

2046
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,640
Just like me!

2047
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,700
Oh my god, now we're best friends!

2048
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:06,360
Oh, spread out.

2049
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,200
Wait, I just did like that.

2050
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:09,360
I can't believe it.

2051
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,400
I have to give him money.

2052
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,640
Rent a friend.

2053
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,320
Instead of rent a girlfriend, it's rent a friend.

2054
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:21,200
About to talk to him again?

2055
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,340
Oh my god, how much time do you want me...

2056
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,960
How much do you want me to talk to you?

2057
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,720
You're tarnished too, ain't you?

2058
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,060
Can you see it then?

2059
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,080
Rent a hole, me.

2060
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,320
The guidance of grace, I mean.

2061
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,380
I can't see it at all no more.

2062
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,280
Makes no bloody sense anyway.

2063
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:41,140
Why some no-name shithead like me should get called to the lands between.

2064
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,140
Cruel bloody joke, you ask me.

2065
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,280
Maybe something went tits over there.

2066
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,360
Maybe he's been broke for a good long time.

2067
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,060
The air tree, I'm saying.

2068
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,020
What?

2069
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,940
I don't know what any of that means, but okay.

2070
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:58,680
Alright, let's get my horse on here.

2071
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,560
Let's go, my little horse!

2072
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,240
Alright.

2073
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:07,140
There has to be something up ahead, right?

2074
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,160
Please, there's so much to explore.

2075
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:11,680
I'm so low.

2076
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,440
Oh, that's a map!

2077
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,180
There has to be a- Wait.

2078
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:16,820
I fucking knew it.

2079
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,280
I fucking knew you were not- Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

2080
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:20,920
Alright.

2081
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,180
Uhhhhhhhhh.

2082
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,340
Uhhhhhhhhh.

2083
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:31,600
Uhhhhhhhhh.

2084
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:36,510
No way he knows.

2085
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:38,510
That's a lobster!

2086
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:40,370
Okay.

2087
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:41,790
No way.

2088
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,350
Oh my god, that's him!

2089
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:44,790
Oh!

2090
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:46,350
And there's so much babies!

2091
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:49,730
Look at all these babies on his fucking tail!

2092
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:55,250
That's the- That's the lobster.

2093
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:57,610
Can't see me.

2094
01:22:57,810 --> 01:22:59,470
Cause he's blind!

2095
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:02,030
Oh, it wasn't even a map.

2096
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:04,530
Thought it was a fucking map.

2097
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:06,210
Okay.

2098
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:08,370
Slowly walk away.

2099
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:10,550
He doesn't know.

2100
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:12,990
There we go.

2101
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:14,510
Dinner time!

2102
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,730
Guys, I- I don't know.

2103
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:24,070
They seem- They're sort of like- Really, really, really, really big, guys.

2104
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:26,670
I-I don't know if I could make it through.

2105
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,030
I don't know.

2106
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,710
I don't know if I'd win this.

2107
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,120
Wow, this area is so fucking big.

2108
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,720
I'm like, eternally lost.

2109
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,840
Like, there's like, no pathway or anything.

2110
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,520
Guys, there were three of them.

2111
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,700
If it wasn't whatever he was, then maybe.

2112
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,880
But there was like- Oh, there's a child.

2113
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:53,820
Okay, look at this.

2114
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:54,440
Guys.

2115
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,080
Fine, guys.

2116
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,000
I'll take him.

2117
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:02,000
I know you guys really wanted me to fight him.

2118
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:02,740
Look.

2119
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:03,360
Oh, look.

2120
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,300
It's a family too.

2121
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:06,580
Let's get that.

2122
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,660
Oh my god!

2123
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:07,960
Wait!

2124
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:08,480
Wait!

2125
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,960
I thought you were a baby!

2126
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,020
I-

2127
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:15,900
Wait a minute!

2128
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:16,520
Oh!

2129
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,340
Wait a minute!

2130
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:17,960
Oh!

2131
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,620
I just- I wanted- Wait!

2132
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,680
They're doing flips and shit?!

2133
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,520
I thought I was a baby!

2134
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,280
Why is this baby flipping?!

2135
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,120
Oh my god!

2136
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:45,770
Oh my- Holy shit!

2137
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:46,750
Oh my god!

2138
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:49,650
It's so- Holy fuck!

2139
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:51,850
Okay.

2140
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:52,830
Okay, guys.

2141
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:53,390
I can do this.

2142
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:54,050
I can do this.

2143
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:55,090
I can do this.

2144
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:55,730
I can do this.

2145
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:56,530
I can do- Okay, there we go.

2146
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,450
We killed a family.

2147
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:58,070
Alright.

2148
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,650
See, I told you guys.

2149
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:04,530
I took you walk into the wrong family.

2150
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:06,410
How the fuck am I supposed to know?!

2151
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:11,090
It was like a fucking family of acrobatics!

2152
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:15,810
I didn't know they were from the circus.

2153
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:18,630
I just- I didn't know the first try.

2154
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:23,250
I just- I didn't know the first try.

2155
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:24,290
Alright.

2156
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:26,390
Let's get out of here.

2157
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:28,490
I don't trust this family anymore.

2158
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:34,860
Alright.

2159
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:35,780
That's fine.

2160
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:37,560
They can join their dead wife.

2161
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:39,780
Slash mom.

2162
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,440
Alright.

2163
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,420
Maybe there's something over here?

2164
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,820
What's that?

2165
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,080
Oh, that's the tree!

2166
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:50,300
Oh my god.

2167
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,540
There's so many of them.

2168
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:53,720
That's right.

2169
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,580
I'm gonna kill Robin's family again.

2170
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,380
What's that?

2171
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,540
Another smithing stone.

2172
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:07,990
Wait, is that- What is that over there?

2173
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:09,450
The fuck is that?

2174
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:10,630
Can I see that?

2175
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:14,850
Why is this just in the air like that?

2176
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:18,530
What is that?

2177
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:19,730
Oh, wait.

2178
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:21,690
Did I shoot it?

2179
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:25,970
Guys, I know you guys say look at Matt, but look at where Matt-

2180
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:31,990
I don't know.

2181
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:34,910
I think they're like archers or some shit.

2182
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,980
They look like archers and I don't know.

2183
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,840
I don't trust my luck.

2184
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:46,580
What Matt?

2185
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:49,820
Exactly.

2186
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,900
There's an icon?

2187
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,860
What the fucking giant ass tree?

2188
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,060
No, that's my icon.

2189
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:03,520
I put that there.

2190
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:09,100
Oh, that one?

2191
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,320
That pillar?

2192
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,620
Wait, have I been to this area?

2193
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:24,670
I'll grab this.

2194
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:26,830
What is this?

2195
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:29,530
OH SHIT!

2196
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:32,710
Oh, okay.

2197
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,190
I don't know why I freaked out.

2198
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:36,410
Oh, okay.

2199
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:36,910
Okay.

2200
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:38,290
Now I know why I freaked out.

2201
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:39,510
Oh my god.

2202
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:40,110
It's not a cliff.

2203
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:40,990
It's not a cliff.

2204
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:42,790
It's not a cliff.

2205
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:43,690
It's not a cliff.

2206
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:44,230
I'm okay.

2207
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:44,970
I'm okay.

2208
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:47,810
It's not a cliff, guys.

2209
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:48,930
I'm so healthy.

2210
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:50,730
Oh my god.

2211
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,700
Oh my

2212
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:05,460
god.

2213
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:06,340
Oh my god.

2214
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,400
Oh my god.

2215
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,640
Wait, what?

2216
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,440
Where do I go?

2217
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,680
What do I... I don't...

2218
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:27,460
Where?

2219
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,420
Where, okay.

2220
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,680
Okay, okay, here.

2221
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,280
Okay, I don't even know where to go.

2222
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,040
Where am I?

2223
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:49,500
Where... Where the fuck did I... Oh, wait, I died next door?

2224
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,400
Okay, nice, nice.

2225
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,480
I died next door.

2226
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,640
Where he fucked me up.

2227
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,040
Okay, thank God.

2228
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,360
Okay, it was literally right where I died.

2229
01:28:58,540 --> 01:28:59,040
Thank God.

2230
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,260
Wait, where the fuck is my... Oh, there it is.

2231
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,920
Okay, now I know.

2232
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:07,240
That's right.

2233
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,000
That's right.

2234
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,820
Wait, can I still summon?

2235
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,100
Okay, I figured it out.

2236
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:19,800
Bye.

2237
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:21,780
Bye.

2238
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:23,060
I figured it out.

2239
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:28,350
No, it's okay.

2240
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:30,110
Shit.

2241
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:31,770
That's fucking right.

2242
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:32,810
Oh, shit.

2243
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:33,650
Oh, shit.

2244
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:34,530
Okay.

2245
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:35,310
Okay.

2246
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,050
That's fine.

2247
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:36,850
I'll bait him.

2248
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:37,950
I'll bait him.

2249
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:39,690
Oh, that's right.

2250
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:41,290
You don't know where I'm going to go.

2251
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:42,070
That's okay, right?

2252
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:43,210
Watch this.

2253
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:46,150
Oh, no.

2254
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:46,690
Oh, no.

2255
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:47,350
Oh, no.

2256
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:49,410
That's fine.

2257
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:50,250
Watch this.

2258
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:55,610
Oh, my God.

2259
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:56,890
Oh, my God.

2260
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:56,990
Oh, my God.

2261
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:57,170
It's fine.

2262
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:57,830
I still did it.

2263
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,290
Oh, that's right.

2264
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:00,690
I got a cliff.

2265
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:01,790
I have high ground.

2266
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:05,930
Oh, shit.

2267
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:07,110
Oh, shit.

2268
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:09,250
Oh, yes, I got that, too.

2269
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:11,070
Yes, I got that, too.

2270
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:11,830
What did I do?

2271
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,930
Oh, my God.

2272
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:14,790
You expected to get high ground with me.

2273
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:18,070
Oh, my God.

2274
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:18,790
It's fine.

2275
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:19,330
It's fine.

2276
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,170
I'm so healthy.

2277
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,390
I'm so healthy.

2278
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,750
I'm so healthy.

2279
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:24,650
Whoa.

2280
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:25,610
Whoa.

2281
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:26,650
Whoa.

2282
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:28,370
Whoa.

2283
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:30,010
Fine.

2284
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:33,910
Yeah.

2285
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:35,150
What you gonna do?

2286
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:37,270
What you gonna do?

2287
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:40,070
Oh, shit.

2288
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:40,690
Shit.

2289
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:41,250
I'm sorry.

2290
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:42,110
I'm sorry.

2291
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:43,570
I'm fucking sorry.

2292
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,010
Oh my god, my controller.

2293
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:57,910
Sorry, I played around with him for too long.

2294
01:30:58,490 --> 01:30:59,190
It's my bad.

2295
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:00,810
Oh no.

2296
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:04,110
Okay, I played around with my food.

2297
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:10,330
Okay, okay.

2298
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:12,530
I'll take it seriously this time.

2299
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:12,970
I swear.

2300
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:13,450
I swear.

2301
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:14,990
I'll take it seriously this time.

2302
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:17,570
I swear.

2303
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:21,050
This time, I'll take this fight seriously.

2304
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:24,430
Okay, because I forgot I have a death counter.

2305
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:30,360
That's right.

2306
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:31,920
First slice.

2307
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:32,820
Oh no.

2308
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:37,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2309
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:39,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2310
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,720
Whoa.

2311
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:40,780
Whoa.

2312
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:46,970
There you go.

2313
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,030
Okay, I figured it out.

2314
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:55,000
What?

2315
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:05,470
See, look at that.

2316
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:07,690
I took it seriously, chat.

2317
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:08,890
Look at that.

2318
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,310
I took it seriously.

2319
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,230
Look at that.

2320
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:15,710
I fucking cheese my way out.

2321
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,850
I hear the power of the rock.

2322
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:20,350
That's right.

2323
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:24,070
I win with the power of the rock!

2324
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:26,950
The high ground!

2325
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:29,350
Get anything out of here.

2326
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:30,170
What the fuck?

2327
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:31,790
Is this gonna be there forever?

2328
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,530
Wait, he respawns?

2329
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:38,230
Hey, what the fuck was the point of killing him?

2330
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:41,330
If he just respawns.

2331
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:45,470
Got the... Oh my god!

2332
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:46,550
Oh my god!

2333
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,410
Why are they there?

2334
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,890
Why are they there?

2335
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,970
And a whole family!

2336
01:32:53,970 --> 01:32:54,450
Alright.

2337
01:32:55,710 --> 01:32:56,550
For his weapon.

2338
01:32:56,690 --> 01:32:57,210
Did I got it?

2339
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:58,710
I didn't even know if I got his weapon.

2340
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:01,850
Or why is mine?

2341
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:04,350
There's a fucking gang there!

2342
01:33:05,930 --> 01:33:07,930
And Toki, they live there.

2343
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:09,250
You're their invader.

2344
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:12,650
Oh, I got the cookbook.

2345
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:13,450
Oh, hey!

2346
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:14,770
Wait, I need that item.

2347
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,250
That's a good item.

2348
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:20,630
I don't know what it is, but I assume it's a good item.

2349
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:22,650
Get your ass back here.

2350
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:24,670
Get your ass back here.

2351
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:27,230
Fucking right.

2352
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:28,130
Oh my god.

2353
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:30,230
He's just fucking running.

2354
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:31,370
Come on.

2355
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:33,710
Oh my god.

2356
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:35,750
He's just running.

2357
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,610
Little bitch!

2358
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:44,450
Get over here!

2359
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:46,630
Ah!

2360
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,610
Oh, where did he take me?

2361
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:50,370
I'm in a new area.

2362
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:52,610
Where did this guy take me?

2363
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:56,490
Oh, nice.

2364
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:57,450
He took me somewhere.

2365
01:33:58,770 --> 01:33:59,970
I don't know where.

2366
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:04,930
But like, this seems like a good place to explore.

2367
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:08,930
Oh, nice.

2368
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:09,190
Look.

2369
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:14,090
I got a hatchet.

2370
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:15,570
Oh, I got a new incantation?

2371
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:16,430
What's that?

2372
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:19,210
Where do I equip it?

2373
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:23,070
What's this?

2374
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,790
Uh, the blood thing?

2375
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:25,330
Oh, here!

2376
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:25,810
Okay.

2377
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:29,270
Wait, how do I equip this?

2378
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,660
Oh, it's magic.

2379
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:41,000
Oh, it's magic.

2380
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,560
What the fuck?

2381
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,160
Oh, are you following me this entire time?

2382
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,620
Oh my god, I was in the menu.

2383
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,160
I was like, why can't I kill him?

2384
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,700
Oh, it's a spell.

2385
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:51,300
Oh, it's a spell.

2386
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:52,200
I have to learn it.

2387
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:52,460
Okay.

2388
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,420
Oh, they've been slowly following me.

2389
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,460
Fire ahead?

2390
01:34:58,780 --> 01:34:59,280
This guy?

2391
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,700
Armant ahead.

2392
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:04,280
Him?

2393
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,640
What's around with him?

2394
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:14,800
Jellyfish.

2395
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:19,120
All right, go.

2396
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,540
There you go.

2397
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:26,740
That's fine.

2398
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:27,720
I'll just do this.

2399
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:28,800
All right, jellyfish.

2400
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:29,040
Go.

2401
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:30,900
Go, jellyfish!

2402
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:31,240
Go!

2403
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,660
That's fine.

2404
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,780
You do your thing, little man.

2405
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,460
Oh my god.

2406
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,780
Oh my god.

2407
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,060
Oh my god, there's so many.

2408
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:45,100
There's so many.

2409
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,560
Oh, that's why he said liar ahead.

2410
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:53,240
Oh my god.

2411
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:54,260
Oh, I'm leaving.

2412
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:55,900
Goodbye.

2413
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,020
Die for me!

2414
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:04,110
It's fine.

2415
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:05,790
It's fine.

2416
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:07,270
I can slowly, I can take them.

2417
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:09,250
Wait, what?

2418
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:11,070
Oh, it's ice magic.

2419
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:13,930
What?

2420
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:15,030
How does he hit first?

2421
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:17,630
All right.

2422
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:20,410
It's okay.

2423
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:26,310
Oh my god, it's not okay.

2424
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:27,470
It's no longer okay.

2425
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:28,630
It's no longer...

2426
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:30,310
Oh my god, he got me in a corner!

2427
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:35,260
Okay.

2428
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,060
Oh, I am...

2429
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,560
I am all everywhere.

2430
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:40,180
Please.

2431
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,480
Oh, please!

2432
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:42,080
I'm everywhere!

2433
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:43,000
I can't see!

2434
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,200
I can't see!

2435
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,820
Oh my god, he's doing flips and shit.

2436
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,680
All right, we got one.

2437
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,060
Okay, it's fine.

2438
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:06,840
Oh, it's not fine.

2439
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,120
It's not fine.

2440
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,820
JK, it's fine!

2441
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:14,260
Oh my god, I'm leaving a message down.

2442
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,860
There we go.

2443
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,460
Remember the...

2444
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,020
There's head here!

2445
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:32,210
All right.

2446
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:35,490
I'm gonna get the flowers out.

2447
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:42,030
Okay, I have to get rid of these guys first before I grab the loot.

2448
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:46,770
All right.

2449
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:48,470
Things are fine.

2450
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:50,810
Things are fine.

2451
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:51,710
Everything is fine.

2452
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:55,150
Okay, now I can grab the loot.

2453
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:02,630
Oh, I don't know if that's helpful or not, but I'll take it.

2454
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,080
I'm so good.

2455
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,240
Like, everything just looks the same.

2456
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,780
It all just looks the same.

2457
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:19,980
Oh, hey!

2458
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:21,020
Oh, there's Grace!

2459
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:21,540
Nice!

2460
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:24,340
All right.

2461
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:28,580
I'm gonna get this Grace up real quick.

2462
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:32,160
And then hope nothing comes towards me.

2463
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,060
Yeah, I feel safe.

2464
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,080
No, I feel safe here.

2465
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,060
There's no way anything's gonna kill me, right?

2466
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,180
All right.

2467
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,260
Oh, I still don't have enough.

2468
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:40,820
All right.

2469
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,000
Oh, wait.

2470
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:43,540
I can memorize the spell.

2471
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,560
Can I do this?

2472
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:49,260
Oh, I need more faith.

2473
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:49,860
Okay.

2474
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:52,100
I'm next to the...

2475
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,180
Wait, what?

2476
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,960
Am I next to a dragon?

2477
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:58,400
Wait, am I not safe?

2478
01:38:59,060 --> 01:38:59,900
But I'm...

2479
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,020
I'm Mother Grace!

2480
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,220
How can I not be safe?

2481
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,500
Oh, God.

2482
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:05,840
Okay.

2483
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:07,040
Okay, okay.

2484
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:07,380
I'm...

2485
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,580
No, I should be fine.

2486
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:09,320
I'm sitting down.

2487
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:10,420
I'm sitting down.

2488
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:11,860
Okay, I'll be right back, guys.

2489
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,680
I'll take a call real quick.

2490
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,020
I notice I got a call.

2491
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:15,840
I'll be right back.

2492
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:01,610
I'm back.

2493
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:03,050
I'm back, guys.

2494
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:04,010
Okay, I knew it.

2495
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:04,870
I knew I'd be safe.

2496
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:08,590
So, I had to take a call because Dad's at the vet for his checkup.

2497
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:11,030
And they were telling me what time I could pick him up.

2498
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:13,390
So, I just had to, like, check my voicemail.

2499
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:20,110
God, this is, like...

2500
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:20,890
I swear, this...

2501
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:22,890
This is, like, the most non...

2502
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:25,830
I know, like, Elden Ring is, like, super...

2503
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:26,690
Uh...

2504
01:42:26,690 --> 01:42:28,710
It's, like, different from the other Souls-like game.

2505
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:29,970
And it's, like, more...

2506
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:31,350
More open world.

2507
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,510
But, like...

2508
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:33,510
This is, like...

2509
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:34,810
The first part was easy.

2510
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:36,330
It felt like a straight line.

2511
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:39,290
This one is, like, so fucking open world.

2512
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:41,510
I'm so fucking lost.

2513
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:43,450
I don't know where I am.

2514
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:44,310
I...

2515
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:49,750
Where am I?

2516
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:54,870
I'm so lost.

2517
01:42:58,350 --> 01:42:59,130
It's...

2518
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:00,890
All I see is water.

2519
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:05,050
Where the fuck is the...

2520
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:09,430
I've been trying to find this map for 80 years.

2521
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:15,770
I wish I knew where this map is.

2522
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:18,930
Maybe there's a map here.

2523
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:20,230
Is that where I kill...

2524
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:21,370
Is that the lobsters?

2525
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:29,480
North-west?

2526
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:30,840
Here?

2527
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,380
Wait, who's trying to kill me?

2528
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,700
Oh my god!

2529
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:34,680
Don't worry.

2530
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,040
That can't hit me, right?

2531
01:43:37,180 --> 01:43:38,400
Yeah, he doesn't know.

2532
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:39,620
All right.

2533
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:44,440
North-west.

2534
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,560
Okay, I'll go north-west.

2535
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:51,950
Surely I'll...

2536
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:53,190
I'll figure it out.

2537
01:43:54,570 --> 01:43:55,770
Wait, what's all that?

2538
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:00,790
What is that?

2539
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:01,670
Are they nice?

2540
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,710
Is this...

2541
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:04,490
Oh, they're all the dunk beaters!

2542
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:06,590
Oh!

2543
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:10,210
Oh!

2544
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:12,490
Look at all these dunk beaters!

2545
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:16,450
Okay, I can get that.

2546
01:44:17,550 --> 01:44:18,370
Let him go!

2547
01:44:18,370 --> 01:44:18,450
Oh!

2548
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:23,880
That's cool!

2549
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:25,380
It's all that free loot!

2550
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,680
Wait, why are there dead bodies next to me?

2551
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:35,330
There you go!

2552
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:36,330
One more hit!

2553
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:38,910
Yeah!

2554
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:44,760
Where's my free loot?

2555
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:45,460
Oh!

2556
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,400
Oh, bitch!

2557
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:47,660
Bitch.

2558
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,580
That's what they were trying to do.

2559
01:44:58,900 --> 01:44:59,840
That's right.

2560
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,300
Never punished.

2561
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:11,070
Fucking knew it.

2562
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:12,110
Never punished.

2563
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:15,330
That's right.

2564
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:16,730
You almost got me.

2565
01:45:17,050 --> 01:45:19,470
You almost fucking got me.

2566
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:20,130
There.

2567
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:25,760
Okay.

2568
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:27,040
Let's go this way.

2569
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,480
This is still northwest, right?

2570
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:30,260
Why do I go up here?

2571
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:31,280
There's a cliff here.

2572
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:35,920
Okay.

2573
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,180
Let me... get over here, little guy.

2574
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:41,560
I will go up.

2575
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:43,480
That's northwest, right?

2576
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:44,740
Oh, we're out of the lake.

2577
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,300
Oh my god.

2578
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:47,780
We're finally out of the lake.

2579
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:49,300
Oh my god.

2580
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:51,100
It's not just water now.

2581
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:52,980
It's just grass this time.

2582
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:57,040
Oh, I went past the destination?

2583
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:00,000
I don't even know where I am, guys.

2584
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:03,200
You think I know where destination is anymore?

2585
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,180
I...

2586
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,980
Guys, I don't even know where destination is.

2587
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:17,730
That's the secret.

2588
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:19,010
I don't even know.

2589
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:21,250
I'm so fucking lost.

2590
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:24,110
There's worms.

2591
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:26,510
Oh, look at these little guys.

2592
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:28,290
They're so pathetic.

2593
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:29,170
Look at them.

2594
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:29,710
Look at that.

2595
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:32,050
Look at these little... Wait, they're not worms.

2596
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:33,090
Wait.

2597
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,510
Oh, wait.

2598
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:34,670
It's just... They're just rocks.

2599
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:35,110
Oh.

2600
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:36,730
They're so pretty.

2601
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:37,730
Pathetic.

2602
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:38,250
Look at that.

2603
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:39,990
Look at these dumb fucking rocks.

2604
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:42,770
There you go.

2605
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:43,850
I'll grab that.

2606
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:46,050
Yeah, your friend died and you don't care.

2607
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:48,310
Hey, they didn't even care their friend died.

2608
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:53,050
I'll kill this sheep.

2609
01:46:54,130 --> 01:46:54,530
That's right.

2610
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:56,150
Get over here.

2611
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:57,070
I need loot.

2612
01:46:58,610 --> 01:46:59,990
Wait, you didn't give me any loot.

2613
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:02,290
Hey, you saw that?

2614
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:03,570
I'm gonna kill you too.

2615
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:05,770
Get over here.

2616
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:06,550
Give me your loot.

2617
01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:07,830
Nice.

2618
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:08,570
Oh, there you go.

2619
01:47:08,570 --> 01:47:10,910
Hey, I needed those bones.

2620
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:12,790
What the fuck?

2621
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:13,730
He's just rolling.

2622
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:15,270
It's so inefficient.

2623
01:47:15,490 --> 01:47:16,390
Running was faster.

2624
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:24,030
Alright.

2625
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:26,270
No boss.

2626
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:26,870
Just...

2627
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:27,730
Just loot.

2628
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:30,710
Maybe there's something here.

2629
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:35,460
Oh.

2630
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:36,880
Crafting.

2631
01:47:42,650 --> 01:47:44,930
There's one boss.

2632
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:45,790
I just...

2633
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:48,910
One...

2634
01:47:48,910 --> 01:47:50,570
One story boss.

2635
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:51,390
Where is...

2636
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:51,770
I just...

2637
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:54,430
I just wanna find one story boss.

2638
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:57,490
Map.

2639
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:58,650
Lantern like...

2640
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:00,510
There's no lantern like area though.

2641
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:03,730
Lantern like icon.

2642
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:04,930
This?

2643
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:08,370
Oh.

2644
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:09,350
No.

2645
01:48:14,090 --> 01:48:14,790
This?

2646
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:20,800
Wait, is it that?

2647
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,960
Oh, is that a map?

2648
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:25,990
Wait, where's...

2649
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:27,030
That's the map, right?

2650
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:29,310
Oh my god.

2651
01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:30,590
Where did I go?

2652
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:35,870
Where did I...

2653
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:37,030
Where did I...

2654
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:38,310
Where did I go?

2655
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:39,610
Oh, I fucking...

2656
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:40,730
Oh my god.

2657
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:41,690
Okay, let's go back.

2658
01:48:42,910 --> 01:48:44,090
Let's go back.

2659
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:46,070
Where am I?

2660
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:47,490
What do you...

2661
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:49,150
I went so far.

2662
01:48:52,850 --> 01:48:54,030
Holy shit.

2663
01:48:54,710 --> 01:48:55,830
I actually like...

2664
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:58,050
Went on like...

2665
01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:59,070
Around the world.

2666
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:01,670
Around the world.

2667
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:03,130
Around the world.

2668
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:06,450
I went far, far away.

2669
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:08,230
I don't even know where my journey...

2670
01:49:08,230 --> 01:49:08,870
Ended.

2671
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:13,330
I went off road.

2672
01:49:13,670 --> 01:49:14,390
Oh my god.

2673
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:15,310
That's the lobster.

2674
01:49:15,910 --> 01:49:18,210
I heard many things about that man.

2675
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:22,270
I was like...

2676
01:49:22,270 --> 01:49:24,490
I was so cold from the destination.

2677
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:26,530
It wasn't even hot...

2678
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:26,850
Hot...

2679
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:27,670
Cold anymore.

2680
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:28,550
It was like...

2681
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:29,190
We're in Antarctica.

2682
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:33,700
Huh?

2683
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,040
How did I get off?

2684
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:35,320
Okay.

2685
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:36,980
That's the faster way.

2686
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,080
Apparently there's a map here.

2687
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:51,060
Map, map...

2688
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:01,300
Wait, I walked past the map?

2689
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,260
Is that a map?

2690
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:03,040
No.

2691
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:06,680
Wait, what?

2692
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,320
I ran past the map?

2693
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:13,860
I don't see no map.

2694
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,360
A little pillar?

2695
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,000
Oh shit, there it is.

2696
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:23,780
Found the map.

2697
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:27,220
Finally, I shall no longer be lost.

2698
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,380
Oh my god.

2699
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:30,600
Finally.

2700
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:31,680
Oh my god.

2701
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,960
This is a lot different than I expected it to be.

2702
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:35,420
All right.

2703
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,140
Where's the nearest boss, guys?

2704
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,440
We did it.

2705
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:44,860
Mission accomplished.

2706
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:49,040
Everything looks the same.

2707
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,540
Boss and building?

2708
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:56,600
Oh, that building?

2709
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,400
Oh, in the academy?

2710
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,460
All right, let's go.

2711
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:06,560
Guys, I don't trust you when you... I no longer trust you when you say...

2712
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,400
What?

2713
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:10,180
When you say in the... in the dragon.

2714
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:16,160
For some reason, I don't really trust you guys when you say the dragon.

2715
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,920
Wait, I do need to kill the dragon for the academy?

2716
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:26,700
I'm just a little... Wait, what's this crab doing here?

2717
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:27,920
Get out of here.

2718
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:29,560
Give me your loot.

2719
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,120
Oh, I stilled his eggs.

2720
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:35,480
Dragon wasn't wrong in the end?

2721
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,400
Wait, so that's the academy.

2722
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:44,060
Where's the door?

2723
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:48,940
What the fuck's the door?

2724
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:49,520
What the fuck's the door?

2725
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:49,680
Wait, no.

2726
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:50,220
It's here.

2727
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:03,430
Yeah.

2728
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:04,770
There's a gate here.

2729
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:08,310
That's just a town?

2730
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:10,610
What's that?

2731
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:14,570
Oh, it's that thing over here.

2732
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:16,290
Yeah.

2733
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:17,230
Okay, I see it.

2734
01:52:17,370 --> 01:52:17,730
I see it.

2735
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:18,890
Okay, I just gotta...

2736
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:19,310
All right.

2737
01:52:19,490 --> 01:52:20,930
Let's go kill that dragon then.

2738
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:23,630
I don't remember where the dragon is.

2739
01:52:29,070 --> 01:52:30,710
Wait, where did I...

2740
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:32,770
Where did I leave the dragon?

2741
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:34,410
I traveled so far.

2742
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:35,350
I...

2743
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:38,250
I traveled so fucking far.

2744
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:42,630
Where the fuck did we find him?

2745
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:47,120
Was he here?

2746
01:52:48,580 --> 01:52:50,280
Oh my god, guys.

2747
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:51,040
We like...

2748
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:53,180
We traveled so much.

2749
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:57,820
All right, I got this.

2750
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,340
I can kill that dragon.

2751
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:01,060
Oh, there he is.

2752
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:02,200
That's where all the bait was.

2753
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:02,560
Okay.

2754
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:03,940
I see it.

2755
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:05,980
All right.

2756
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,040
I got this.

2757
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,020
Don't worry.

2758
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:11,200
I have a friend.

2759
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:14,480
Wait, I can sneak?

2760
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:14,960
Okay.

2761
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:16,260
Don't worry.

2762
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:17,940
I'm a coward.

2763
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:19,900
Wait, where is he?

2764
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:26,410
Oh, there he is.

2765
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:28,610
Oh, I see him.

2766
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:31,730
Wait, is this fly trying to kill me?

2767
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:33,970
Okay, get out of here.

2768
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:35,070
You're not part of this story.

2769
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:39,510
Okay.

2770
01:53:40,330 --> 01:53:41,070
There you go.

2771
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:42,030
Don't worry.

2772
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:42,930
He's very sleepy.

2773
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:48,030
You should be very, very quiet.

2774
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:51,210
Being a little bitch right now.

2775
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,320
Okay, so he's right here.

2776
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:59,460
Oh, I see the body.

2777
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:04,750
Wait.

2778
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:05,770
Wait.

2779
01:54:07,050 --> 01:54:07,830
Wait a minute.

2780
01:54:08,770 --> 01:54:09,550
Wait a minute.

2781
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:10,850
Wait a minute.

2782
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:12,010
Wait a minute.

2783
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:13,310
Wait a minute.

2784
01:54:13,690 --> 01:54:14,490
Wait a minute.

2785
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:15,510
Wait, don't worry.

2786
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:15,830
Don't worry.

2787
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:16,470
I got a plan.

2788
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:22,360
You got this.

2789
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:23,560
Goodbye.

2790
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:37,000
You got this!

2791
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,480
I believe it!

2792
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:44,440
You got this jellyfish!

2793
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:48,120
You already did it.

2794
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:52,160
Okay, now I can go back here.

2795
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:53,200
I'm safe now.

2796
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:56,980
That's how it's...

2797
01:54:56,980 --> 01:54:59,040
He just...

2798
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:06,000
He knew what he signed up for when he decided to become one of my spirit animals.

2799
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:08,600
He knew what he signed up for!

2800
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:10,840
He signed that contract!

2801
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:21,020
He knew exactly what his purpose in life was.

2802
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:28,280
Alright.

2803
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:31,360
Am I under leveled?

2804
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:33,240
I don't know.

2805
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:34,640
I'm a little...

2806
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:36,880
So worried about that.

2807
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,320
Probably?

2808
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,880
I feel like... Oh shit, that's a giant crab!

2809
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:43,540
You know what?

2810
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:44,580
I can take him.

2811
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:49,140
Watch this.

2812
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:57,570
Oh wait, that crab is easy.

2813
01:55:58,970 --> 01:55:59,950
Watch that.

2814
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,090
Look at him.

2815
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:03,170
Look at him.

2816
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:05,090
He's actually such a little baby!

2817
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:07,110
Look at this baby crab!

2818
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:09,830
That's fucking right!

2819
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:12,810
I knew he was a baby!

2820
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:15,430
That's right.

2821
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:17,770
I only kill the babies.

2822
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:19,070
In game.

2823
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:19,790
In Elden Ring.

2824
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:24,350
Wait, this guy died to a baby?

2825
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:25,030
Wait, no.

2826
01:56:25,090 --> 01:56:26,170
I think he died to all that.

2827
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:34,750
Wait, I need to make sure he died to whatever all those shit is.

2828
01:56:38,030 --> 01:56:39,150
Where's the...

2829
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:40,050
Where do I go next?

2830
01:56:40,310 --> 01:56:40,490
Okay.

2831
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:43,870
I just followed all the way here?

2832
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:50,450
Yeah, I feel like I should avoid those.

2833
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:56,090
I'm trying to like...

2834
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:57,610
Oh my god, how am I lost?

2835
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:59,050
I have a map!

2836
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:03,780
Don't worry.

2837
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,560
We'll find our first boss somewhere.

2838
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:09,360
I have more items.

2839
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:09,880
Dude!

2840
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:11,540
Oh, it's Golden Seed!

2841
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:12,720
Oh, it's here.

2842
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:13,640
Okay, I figured it out.

2843
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:16,460
I see the area.

2844
01:57:17,320 --> 01:57:17,780
Oh, wait.

2845
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:23,750
Did I like, avoid them?

2846
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:25,930
No, I can take him.

2847
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:29,090
I believe.

2848
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:31,430
I've...

2849
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:32,790
I have a special weapon.

2850
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:41,520
This is my special weapon.

2851
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:48,980
My special weapon.

2852
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:56,260
Alright, come over here.

2853
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,000
Oh my god, nice.

2854
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:00,600
Friendly fire.

2855
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:01,840
Nice!

2856
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:02,880
Oh, thank god!

2857
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:03,820
You go!

2858
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:04,880
Jellyfish!

2859
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:05,720
You go!

2860
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:06,540
Jellyfish!

2861
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:07,040
I believe!

2862
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:10,320
Oh my god.

2863
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:11,820
It's fine.

2864
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:12,920
He's tanking it all.

2865
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:16,280
Yippee!

2866
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:19,420
I told you I have a special weapon.

2867
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:24,550
Okay, I gotta get him out of the way.

2868
01:58:25,130 --> 01:58:26,590
And then also hit him too.

2869
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:28,710
That's right.

2870
01:58:28,890 --> 01:58:30,070
Shitty bodyguard.

2871
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:31,490
Right there.

2872
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:35,170
Damn, should have protected your team better.

2873
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:38,410
We did...

2874
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:39,050
Wait, there's loot?

2875
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:40,210
Did he have loot?

2876
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:40,990
I didn't see.

2877
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:43,730
Holy fuck!

2878
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:44,870
Oh my god, he's angry.

2879
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:46,030
Oh, they have loot!

2880
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:51,110
He's like, let me at him!

2881
01:58:51,110 --> 01:58:51,230
He's like, let me at him!

2882
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:58,740
Do not do the academy, not only...

2883
01:58:58,740 --> 01:58:59,440
Oh, fuck!

2884
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:00,700
Oh, I was reading!

2885
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:01,500
Whoa!

2886
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:05,320
Wait, then what do I do?

2887
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:08,140
If I don't do the academy, what do I do?

2888
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:09,360
I'm so lost!

2889
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:19,210
What do I have if I don't do the academy?

2890
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:22,750
Okay.

2891
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:24,770
Ignore it.

2892
01:59:25,570 --> 01:59:26,070
Okay.

2893
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:28,770
My energy is so low.

2894
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:33,390
Don't listen to that guy.

2895
01:59:33,570 --> 01:59:33,970
Oh no.

2896
01:59:34,370 --> 01:59:35,850
My dragoons are fighting now.

2897
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:36,690
Door.

2898
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:43,860
Bad message!

2899
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:50,100
No door?

2900
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:51,940
What the fuck are you talking about?

2901
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:56,480
Precious item ahead?

2902
01:59:56,660 --> 01:59:57,800
Oh, I already killed at that.

2903
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:01,400
The one guys are fighting.

2904
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,160
Oh yeah, there's an item here.

2905
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,680
Oh, it was just arrows.

2906
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:15,480
Oh, fuck!

2907
02:00:15,660 --> 02:00:16,200
That combo!

2908
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:17,900
No!

2909
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:21,460
Oh, he's here.

2910
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:23,160
Oh, there he is.

2911
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:27,920
Nice.

2912
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:32,420
Alright.

2913
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,300
My buddy and I.

2914
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:38,780
Okay, we gotta quit.

2915
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:39,380
Oh, butterflies.

2916
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,580
Let me kill these butterflies real quick.

2917
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:45,020
Oh my god!

2918
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:45,880
Oh my god!

2919
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,100
I know that guy from Night Reign!

2920
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,360
Oh my god!

2921
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:52,100
I know him!

2922
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:53,960
He was in Night Reign!

2923
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:00,240
Okay.

2924
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:05,060
Yeah, I think we're gonna start running.

2925
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:07,540
Don't get one.

2926
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:08,280
Don't eat.

2927
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,600
It will be fine.

2928
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:10,660
Mostly.

2929
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,580
Alright, goodbye.

2930
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,240
I believe in you, jellyfish.

2931
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:14,880
I believe in you!

2932
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:16,560
I believe in you!

2933
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:19,200
Hey guys!

2934
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:22,480
Let's go!

2935
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:22,560
No!

2936
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,080
Oh, I think my friend died.

2937
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:28,380
It's okay.

2938
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:29,080
He'll be back.

2939
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:31,280
Nice.

2940
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:31,960
See you guys?

2941
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:34,220
We made it.

2942
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:37,500
Look at that.

2943
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:38,180
See?

2944
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:41,180
Running away from your problems is the right move.

2945
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:42,980
Don't listen to your therapist.

2946
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:45,920
But also, maybe listen to your therapist.

2947
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:47,600
Oh, nice.

2948
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:48,700
Okay, add charge.

2949
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:49,760
Yay!

2950
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:49,840
Yay!

2951
02:01:52,660 --> 02:01:53,620
Okay, but...

2952
02:01:53,620 --> 02:01:55,100
I'm almost too leveled up.

2953
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:57,660
Alright, that has to be a boss.

2954
02:01:57,780 --> 02:01:59,100
That is so boss-like.

2955
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:01,540
That has to be a boss.

2956
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:09,780
Alright, we could kill one guy.

2957
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:12,800
Thanks, Zookie.

2958
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,820
I now have crippling...

2959
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:15,060
Oh.

2960
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:17,120
It's not?

2961
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,240
But there's so many bloodstains.

2962
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:21,800
So many people died.

2963
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:30,020
Does say visions of good fortune are ahead.

2964
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:31,360
Oh, nice.

2965
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:31,960
I got a map.

2966
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:35,820
Seek west, but be wary of a dragon.

2967
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:37,120
Seek dra...

2968
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:37,980
Oh wait, I already did that.

2969
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:38,680
I did it!

2970
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:39,860
I got the dragon.

2971
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,380
A foot.

2972
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:48,860
Thank you.

2973
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:50,420
Welcome to the tomato farm.

2974
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:51,580
Welcome, welcome.

2975
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:53,800
Oh my god, I'm alive.

2976
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:56,140
Merchant ahead.

2977
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:56,560
Ooh!

2978
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:57,480
Nice.

2979
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,500
Likely blood loss.

2980
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:05,540
Don't worry.

2981
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:08,860
I think my jellyfish is still fighting that dragon to this day.

2982
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:10,520
I think he...

2983
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,960
I'm pretty sure he won, guys.

2984
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:14,480
Up here?

2985
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:19,340
Therefore order required ahead.

2986
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,220
Wait, where did the merchant go?

2987
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,220
No horseback battle ahead.

2988
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:30,540
What's over here?

2989
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:34,600
Yeah, this looks like a PvP spot.

2990
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:36,520
Yeah, this does look like one.

2991
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,240
Examine seal?

2992
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:47,830
Was I just here?

2993
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,750
Oh.

2994
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:55,650
Wait, no, this is new.

2995
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:57,330
Yeah, I've never been here.

2996
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,860
Yeah, this is a new spot.

2997
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:06,860
I've never been here before.

2998
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:08,120
Whoops.

2999
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:09,840
Forgot to charge my phone.

3000
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:12,420
Oopsie.

3001
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:13,940
There you go.

3002
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:14,720
Nice charge.

3003
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,280
Oh!

3004
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:18,840
Nice.

3005
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:19,680
New spot.

3006
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:24,060
I'm out on the back door.

3007
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:27,480
Heard is a little more exciting.

3008
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:31,860
Alright.

3009
02:04:33,700 --> 02:04:36,200
Okay, so we go forward to the academy.

3010
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:44,440
Okay, no horseback riding.

3011
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:45,540
Alright.

3012
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:46,780
Up I go!

3013
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:48,980
Yeah!

3014
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:03,940
No!

3015
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:06,120
I can't put it on the emplivator!

3016
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,580
What's the point?

3017
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,460
What's the point?

3018
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:12,380
What's the point?

3019
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:16,080
Oh, where am I?

3020
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,000
Oh, there's the academy.

3021
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,100
Oh, is this where all the magic students are?

3022
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:21,180
Is this the magic?

3023
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:22,000
The...

3024
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,420
The fucking teacher level?

3025
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:25,460
That I always see like...

3026
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:26,840
People...

3027
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:27,740
Like, clips of?

3028
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:30,280
Ah, man.

3029
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:31,920
This is where all the fucking nerds live.

3030
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:34,660
Stupid nerds.

3031
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,340
God damn it.

3032
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:39,820
Fucking nerds.

3033
02:05:39,820 --> 02:05:40,920
Oh my god!

3034
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:43,360
Okay.

3035
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:46,500
I got one of the nerds.

3036
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:48,500
That's fucking right!

3037
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,760
What you gonna do now, nerd?

3038
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,940
That's right!

3039
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:54,840
I don't even recharge my stamina!

3040
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:00,400
Wait, you can say that?

3041
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:02,320
That bird...

3042
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:03,020
Be wary up?

3043
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:03,600
Oh, wait.

3044
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:04,840
What's up above...

3045
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,380
What's ahead?

3046
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:07,280
Alright.

3047
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:08,900
Let's put my message down.

3048
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:10,620
Ah!

3049
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:17,000
Let's see.

3050
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:17,820
Is there a nerd?

3051
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:19,180
Ha ha ha ha!

3052
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:21,080
Sinner!

3053
02:06:21,620 --> 02:06:22,500
Ha ha ha ha!

3054
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,160
That's it.

3055
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:25,040
Ah ha!

3056
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,120
Sinner!

3057
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:28,580
He he he he!

3058
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:30,500
Wasn't there a thing where like...

3059
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:31,780
Uh...

3060
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:33,160
People who are like...

3061
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:36,760
Extra Christian can't read any books about magic because like...

3062
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:37,660
You get sent to hell?

3063
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:39,280
Because like...

3064
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,400
Because magic is like...

3065
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:42,320
The source...

3066
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:44,060
Like the power of the devil.

3067
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:45,580
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3068
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:47,000
That's right!

3069
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:48,800
Look at all these sinners!

3070
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,440
You're all going to hell!

3071
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:57,970
That's fucking right!

3072
02:06:58,670 --> 02:06:59,970
Oh my god!

3073
02:07:01,150 --> 02:07:01,790
Wait, what?

3074
02:07:02,110 --> 02:07:03,310
Wait, I can't send jellyfish?

3075
02:07:06,470 --> 02:07:07,770
Wait, what's the point if I...

3076
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:08,770
Holy shit!

3077
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:10,310
Oh!

3078
02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:12,010
Okay, he tripped and fell.

3079
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:14,310
Oh my god, they don't have to use stairs.

3080
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:14,990
Thank god.

3081
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:20,250
Okay, it's not a summon area.

3082
02:07:21,130 --> 02:07:24,230
Why they never summon area when I need him?

3083
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:28,670
Okay.

3084
02:07:32,110 --> 02:07:33,170
Alright, that's fine.

3085
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:35,610
Get this nerd out of here.

3086
02:07:37,770 --> 02:07:38,850
I like how they...

3087
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:40,470
I like how they can trip on stairs.

3088
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:41,130
Like...

3089
02:07:41,790 --> 02:07:43,050
That brings me joy.

3090
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:43,190
What?

3091
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:46,870
Oh, there we go.

3092
02:07:47,070 --> 02:07:47,890
I needed this.

3093
02:07:52,490 --> 02:07:52,930
Alright.

3094
02:07:56,790 --> 02:07:57,230
Nice.

3095
02:07:57,530 --> 02:07:57,950
Do I know?

3096
02:07:58,250 --> 02:07:59,170
Oh, I almost do.

3097
02:07:59,270 --> 02:08:00,230
I can just fight them here.

3098
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:04,030
It's true.

3099
02:08:04,530 --> 02:08:05,450
It's true.

3100
02:08:05,450 --> 02:08:06,130
The instant they...

3101
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:11,670
The moment they look at a book about magic, they go straight to hell.

3102
02:08:12,950 --> 02:08:13,330
Hello?

3103
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:13,990
Hey.

3104
02:08:19,650 --> 02:08:21,050
Okay, I don't have...

3105
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:23,050
Okay, the only...

3106
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:24,030
Oh my god!

3107
02:08:24,250 --> 02:08:25,170
Oh my god!

3108
02:08:25,170 --> 02:08:25,510
Oh no!

3109
02:08:29,870 --> 02:08:30,670
Oh no!

3110
02:08:31,190 --> 02:08:31,630
Oh no!

3111
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:33,030
I just wanted more...

3112
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:35,830
Oh, thank you for the message was a praise.

3113
02:08:36,210 --> 02:08:36,530
Thank...

3114
02:08:36,530 --> 02:08:37,290
Thank you guys.

3115
02:08:37,550 --> 02:08:38,670
Thank you.

3116
02:08:38,850 --> 02:08:40,930
The airport, thank you for the super chat.

3117
02:08:41,170 --> 02:08:41,550
Thank you.

3118
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:42,350
Thank you.

3119
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:45,310
I really...

3120
02:08:45,310 --> 02:08:46,370
Thanks guys.

3121
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:48,550
Thank you for the message.

3122
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:50,190
I was gonna leave.

3123
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:51,050
I don't wanna fight...

3124
02:08:51,050 --> 02:08:52,250
I don't wanna fight those guys.

3125
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:53,730
Those guys are a little...

3126
02:08:53,730 --> 02:08:55,250
A little too freaky for me.

3127
02:08:56,490 --> 02:08:57,550
I'm right outside.

3128
02:08:58,570 --> 02:08:58,870
What?

3129
02:08:59,130 --> 02:09:00,030
Why am I outside?

3130
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:02,430
Be wary of the right...

3131
02:09:02,430 --> 02:09:02,950
Oh, there he is.

3132
02:09:04,230 --> 02:09:05,630
Oh, and he still gets me.

3133
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:08,730
It's fine.

3134
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:11,970
Oh, I should be...

3135
02:09:11,970 --> 02:09:12,930
Almost close too.

3136
02:09:13,810 --> 02:09:15,290
I almost have a level up.

3137
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:15,810
Alright guys.

3138
02:09:15,930 --> 02:09:16,670
What do I level up?

3139
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:23,080
Wait, that's the entrance to the school?

3140
02:09:26,810 --> 02:09:28,250
I thought that...

3141
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:28,630
Am I...

3142
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:29,250
I thought...

3143
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:29,550
Oh wait.

3144
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:35,050
Actual good message.

3145
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:36,510
I have enough.

3146
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:37,350
Figure?

3147
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:37,990
Alright.

3148
02:09:41,580 --> 02:09:42,100
Alright.

3149
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:42,900
Level up.

3150
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:46,700
Alright.

3151
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:47,240
We have...

3152
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:47,720
Figure.

3153
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:51,260
Alright.

3154
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,540
So I was going the right way.

3155
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:56,240
Alright.

3156
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:56,900
I'll kill him again.

3157
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:57,940
I know you're here.

3158
02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:58,840
Come on.

3159
02:09:59,220 --> 02:09:59,680
Come on.

3160
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:00,880
Get over here.

3161
02:10:00,940 --> 02:10:01,460
I know you're here.

3162
02:10:01,580 --> 02:10:02,100
Oh, fuck!

3163
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:02,520
I...

3164
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:04,880
He got me again.

3165
02:10:04,980 --> 02:10:05,560
I don't know how.

3166
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,260
How does he keep doing it?

3167
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:10,900
Jesus.

3168
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:11,800
Oh, he got me.

3169
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:12,280
No!

3170
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:12,380
No!

3171
02:10:12,420 --> 02:10:12,720
No!

3172
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:13,200
Oh wait.

3173
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:13,800
I don't...

3174
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:14,460
Joke's on you!

3175
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:15,760
I don't use magic!

3176
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:17,100
Cause I ain't no pussy!

3177
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,060
That's okay, right.

3178
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:22,320
Joke's on you!

3179
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:25,460
Maybe I'll start using magic here though.

3180
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:32,960
Nice.

3181
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:33,960
What the fuck?

3182
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,100
He just watched his friend die.

3183
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:37,380
Did not care.

3184
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:42,200
Secret passage ahead?

3185
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:42,720
Yeah?

3186
02:10:48,490 --> 02:10:49,110
Fucker.

3187
02:10:49,410 --> 02:10:50,450
You fucker.

3188
02:10:50,610 --> 02:10:51,790
You fucker!

3189
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:52,690
No!

3190
02:10:54,310 --> 02:10:54,870
No!

3191
02:10:58,110 --> 02:11:00,510
There was no secret message!

3192
02:11:08,130 --> 02:11:09,010
My god.

3193
02:11:12,550 --> 02:11:13,110
No.

3194
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:13,870
No, it's okay.

3195
02:11:13,970 --> 02:11:14,650
I don't have magic.

3196
02:11:14,830 --> 02:11:15,610
Oh my god.

3197
02:11:15,610 --> 02:11:17,750
It doesn't matter if I don't have magic!

3198
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:22,340
It's fine.

3199
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:23,020
I can...

3200
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:23,920
That's good.

3201
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:25,320
I just wanted more...

3202
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:25,940
More souls.

3203
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:30,420
It's okay.

3204
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:34,860
It got me.

3205
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,740
It actually got me.

3206
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:48,780
I...

3207
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:48,940
Alright.

3208
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:49,780
Is there...

3209
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:51,360
Where's the word for true?

3210
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:00,340
Do it.

3211
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:06,330
Alright.

3212
02:12:07,130 --> 02:12:07,570
Wait.

3213
02:12:07,730 --> 02:12:07,750
Wait.

3214
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:09,990
There is actually a secret passage?

3215
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:12,570
Swear to god.

3216
02:12:13,110 --> 02:12:14,030
Oh my god.

3217
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:17,680
Wait.

3218
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:19,220
He wasn't lying?

3219
02:12:20,180 --> 02:12:20,620
Oh.

3220
02:12:25,050 --> 02:12:25,490
Okay.

3221
02:12:25,770 --> 02:12:27,370
I'm glad that he like...

3222
02:12:27,370 --> 02:12:27,890
It was like...

3223
02:12:27,890 --> 02:12:28,210
Oh wait.

3224
02:12:28,390 --> 02:12:28,650
Hey there.

3225
02:12:28,870 --> 02:12:29,810
It's like those hikers.

3226
02:12:30,130 --> 02:12:32,030
You know, like you bump into another hiker.

3227
02:12:32,150 --> 02:12:32,690
And you're like, hey.

3228
02:12:33,530 --> 02:12:34,950
Nice hike we're having, aren't we?

3229
02:12:38,130 --> 02:12:39,450
It's the type of hiker.

3230
02:12:39,630 --> 02:12:40,110
It's like, oh yeah.

3231
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:40,910
We're having a night.

3232
02:12:41,110 --> 02:12:42,190
On your right.

3233
02:12:46,990 --> 02:12:48,210
There's no way.

3234
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:49,950
There's no way.

3235
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:51,570
There's no way.

3236
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:52,850
I don't believe it.

3237
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:58,950
I don't believe it.

3238
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:05,200
Okay.

3239
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:07,520
There's no blood though.

3240
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:08,100
Turkey.

3241
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:09,860
You can trust it.

3242
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:10,980
My god.

3243
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:11,360
Okay.

3244
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:12,060
I'm gonna...

3245
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:12,180
Okay.

3246
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:12,560
I'm gonna...

3247
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:13,780
I'm gonna make this jump.

3248
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:15,040
No blood.

3249
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:15,940
No light.

3250
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:24,740
Jump for the beam.

3251
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:25,360
Alright.

3252
02:13:25,680 --> 02:13:26,560
Where do I...

3253
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:26,840
Okay.

3254
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:27,280
Okay.

3255
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:27,620
I'm looking.

3256
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:28,660
Where is it?

3257
02:13:33,060 --> 02:13:33,620
Where is it?

3258
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:34,580
I'm looking at it.

3259
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:36,240
Where the fuck is it?

3260
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:39,540
Where is it?

3261
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:40,400
Where is it?

3262
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:41,040
I'm looking.

3263
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:42,080
Where is it?

3264
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:42,520
Right.

3265
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:44,080
It's down there.

3266
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:44,600
Turkey.

3267
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:45,720
Look down.

3268
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:46,520
Alright.

3269
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:46,900
Alright.

3270
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:47,580
I'm gonna look down.

3271
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:48,820
I'm gonna look down.

3272
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:49,520
Where is it?

3273
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:50,340
Where is it?

3274
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:51,860
It's invisible.

3275
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:54,280
There's an invisible wall, turkey.

3276
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,100
Oh, hey.

3277
02:14:05,010 --> 02:14:06,110
What the fuck?

3278
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:10,270
Oh, there's a...

3279
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:15,130
Oh.

3280
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:22,740
It teleports you.

3281
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,400
Don't worry.

3282
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:25,960
I swear to God.

3283
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:28,280
I... I swear to God.

3284
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:32,420
If I... if I go there and I swear...

3285
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:40,340
Cuz you are tempting me right now.

3286
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:42,700
I am actually... cuz no bloodstains.

3287
02:14:43,220 --> 02:14:46,160
There's no bloodstains.

3288
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:50,540
It's safe to us.

3289
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:55,800
Oh my God.

3290
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:59,080
Oh my God.

3291
02:15:05,330 --> 02:15:06,850
I don't trust you.

3292
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:10,530
I don't trust any of you.

3293
02:15:13,250 --> 02:15:14,910
You almost got me.

3294
02:15:15,170 --> 02:15:16,910
You almost got me.

3295
02:15:17,070 --> 02:15:18,550
I... I thought about it.

3296
02:15:18,690 --> 02:15:20,110
I thought about it.

3297
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:21,590
It was in my head.

3298
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:22,590
It was...

3299
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:28,840
I... I thought about it.

3300
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:29,960
It was right there.

3301
02:15:33,980 --> 02:15:35,500
So it was this way?

3302
02:15:35,780 --> 02:15:36,900
Wait, do I go...

3303
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:39,420
You were... I was... I was this close!

3304
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:40,600
I...

3305
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:42,220
Wait.

3306
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:44,840
Left side or right side chat?

3307
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:46,660
Bridge or not bridge?

3308
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:49,360
Cuz I went in the secret path.

3309
02:15:51,940 --> 02:15:53,260
Oh, that's where I was?

3310
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:54,480
Here?

3311
02:15:57,140 --> 02:15:58,600
Oh, not the bridge.

3312
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:58,920
Okay.

3313
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:03,040
I was this close.

3314
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:04,440
I almost did it.

3315
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,260
I almost did it.

3316
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,900
I really was so close.

3317
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:13,120
I thought about it.

3318
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:20,720
Okay, let's get him out.

3319
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,180
I was like...

3320
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:25,240
Oh my God!

3321
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:26,260
Oh my God!

3322
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,200
What the fuck he's like?

3323
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:28,160
I want in too!

3324
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:33,060
Nice.

3325
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:36,680
Oh.

3326
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:40,060
Let's drop off here?

3327
02:16:52,010 --> 02:16:52,570
Alright.

3328
02:16:55,230 --> 02:16:56,310
So many.

3329
02:16:57,390 --> 02:16:58,610
Oh my God!

3330
02:16:58,830 --> 02:16:59,610
Okay, okay.

3331
02:17:00,310 --> 02:17:02,030
Okay, let me think about this.

3332
02:17:02,150 --> 02:17:02,950
I'll kill him first.

3333
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:10,350
The only thing I worry about is I accidentally fall off.

3334
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:11,790
That's the one thing.

3335
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:14,450
Let's grab...

3336
02:17:14,450 --> 02:17:15,290
Where do I go?

3337
02:17:19,050 --> 02:17:21,730
Where do I go if I just grab and go...

3338
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:22,150
Where?

3339
02:17:22,850 --> 02:17:24,050
Where do I go?

3340
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,160
Okay, he's too busy.

3341
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:42,740
Oh my God!

3342
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:43,280
I didn't wanna...

3343
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:43,960
Okay, that's fine.

3344
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:47,520
Okay, that's fine.

3345
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:48,680
That's also fine.

3346
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:49,520
That's...

3347
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:51,580
That's also fine.

3348
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:52,540
Oh nice!

3349
02:17:52,820 --> 02:17:52,960
Oh!

3350
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:54,560
And he's the best armor?

3351
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:57,760
Alright.

3352
02:17:58,820 --> 02:17:59,740
Let's equip.

3353
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:02,740
Wait, is it?

3354
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:03,740
Oh, it is.

3355
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,760
Oh my God!

3356
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:09,380
It's like so much better.

3357
02:18:13,230 --> 02:18:14,190
Alright.

3358
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:15,550
Oh!

3359
02:18:16,110 --> 02:18:19,190
I am looking pretty handsome right now!

3360
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:20,590
Ladies!

3361
02:18:21,170 --> 02:18:21,670
Ladies!

3362
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:24,190
What at a time!

3363
02:18:25,550 --> 02:18:26,430
Behold!

3364
02:18:28,850 --> 02:18:29,810
Okay.

3365
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:32,130
Where is it?

3366
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:33,210
Look at Mia!

3367
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:34,290
Look at Mia!

3368
02:18:34,290 --> 02:18:35,430
Behold!

3369
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:41,000
Lover!

3370
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:45,100
Look at me!

3371
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,300
I'm your knight in shining armor!

3372
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:49,360
Look at me!

3373
02:18:49,540 --> 02:18:52,120
That is lover material right there!

3374
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:53,240
Behold!

3375
02:18:54,140 --> 02:18:54,820
Lover!

3376
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:59,620
HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE Item ahead!

3377
02:18:59,960 --> 02:19:00,120
Ooh!

3378
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:02,300
Item ahead!

3379
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:02,760
Oh hey!

3380
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:03,780
Where's the item?

3381
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:05,240
Oh!

3382
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:05,880
it's a golden room!

3383
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:06,560
Oh that's good!

3384
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:08,920
Hubba hubba!

3385
02:19:09,220 --> 02:19:09,920
Look at me!

3386
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:10,640
And ladies!

3387
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:15,380
Look at the worst place for our message!

3388
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:17,160
What do you mean?

3389
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:21,780
That's the perfect place for our message!

3390
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:26,060
Oh, there's the item.

3391
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,040
Oh, magic grease.

3392
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:29,040
Oh, hey.

3393
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,460
That's right.

3394
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:35,660
Look at you slowly rise up from the grave.

3395
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:38,200
Oh, fuck!

3396
02:19:39,060 --> 02:19:40,560
Oh my god, there's so many dogs!

3397
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:41,400
There's so many dogs!

3398
02:19:41,820 --> 02:19:42,000
Oh

3399
02:19:45,580 --> 02:19:48,340
my god, oh my god, oh my god,

3400
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,560
oh my god, there's so many dogs!

3401
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:08,760
Get me out of here!

3402
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:09,760
Get me out of here!

3403
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:11,780
Get me out of here!

3404
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:12,840
It's just dogs!

3405
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:18,560
Oh my god,

3406
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:22,560
please.

3407
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:25,040
Oh my god, I lived.

3408
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:25,920
I lived.

3409
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:27,480
Influencer built!

3410
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:29,040
Read Supreme!

3411
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:29,500
Save!

3412
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:36,400
Oh my god!

3413
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:39,120
Save because I'm a content creator!

3414
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:40,460
Let's go!

3415
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:45,700
Start your content creation journey today!

3416
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:51,500
That's like crazy.

3417
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:52,700
I don't know how.

3418
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:53,680
That's crazy.

3419
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:54,900
I should be dead.

3420
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:57,740
I should be dead.

3421
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:00,920
How do I get... It's easy.

3422
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:08,520
Start streaming, get thousands of people to watch you, and then you too can beat Elden Ring with this build.

3423
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:14,920
Chat, don't let Turki's new trip distract you from the fact that... Not yet!

3424
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:16,420
You don't know that!

3425
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:20,380
Just you wait.

3426
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:22,480
This is who you bullied in high school.

3427
02:21:30,820 --> 02:21:32,120
Oh, he fell down.

3428
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:33,820
Wait, this is the guy I was like...

3429
02:21:33,820 --> 02:21:36,940
I was trying to beat... Oh my god, this is bullshit.

3430
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:40,620
I literally can't do a combo because he's stuck against the wall.

3431
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:43,100
Okay.

3432
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:46,320
Jesus, how is he faster?

3433
02:21:52,300 --> 02:21:52,900
Okay.

3434
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:53,760
He's fine.

3435
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:56,200
Oh wait, he stopped moving.

3436
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:57,660
He's tired.

3437
02:21:58,280 --> 02:21:59,360
He's so tired.

3438
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:01,580
Behind.

3439
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:02,000
Behind.

3440
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:02,540
Item ahead.

3441
02:22:04,180 --> 02:22:06,240
Oh nice, another golden rune.

3442
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:09,240
Oh my god.

3443
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,880
I'm not okay right now.

3444
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,060
My guy is so fucked up.

3445
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:17,160
I'm so fucked up.

3446
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:22,980
If only I had a giant butthole.

3447
02:22:27,890 --> 02:22:29,770
Where the fuck are the...

3448
02:22:29,770 --> 02:22:30,570
Graces?

3449
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:32,850
I need a grace like right now.

3450
02:22:37,490 --> 02:22:38,830
I don't like this.

3451
02:22:41,310 --> 02:22:43,130
Oh, I don't like it.

3452
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:46,170
I don't know where all the grace is.

3453
02:22:47,710 --> 02:22:49,170
But I like this.

3454
02:22:50,290 --> 02:22:52,610
Oh, I definitely don't like this.

3455
02:22:53,890 --> 02:22:54,970
Oh my god.

3456
02:22:55,190 --> 02:22:56,470
I can never summon anything.

3457
02:23:01,810 --> 02:23:02,910
Oh my god!

3458
02:23:03,370 --> 02:23:03,890
Jesus!

3459
02:23:04,330 --> 02:23:04,550
Oh!

3460
02:23:06,050 --> 02:23:06,610
Oh!

3461
02:23:08,870 --> 02:23:09,350
I'm running.

3462
02:23:09,650 --> 02:23:11,090
I don't think I live this.

3463
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:12,710
I don't think I live this, guys.

3464
02:23:12,710 --> 02:23:14,670
Oh, I can't reach it!

3465
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:17,230
Aha, JK.

3466
02:23:17,490 --> 02:23:17,930
Yes, I can.

3467
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:20,670
Aha!

3468
02:23:21,390 --> 02:23:23,270
Wait, I think I can kill him by high ground.

3469
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:34,980
Wait, I think I can high ground abuse him.

3470
02:23:41,780 --> 02:23:42,260
Oh!

3471
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:42,920
Oh my god!

3472
02:23:43,060 --> 02:23:43,320
He does!

3473
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:44,200
He does!

3474
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:45,040
Oh,

3475
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:49,800
you freeze!

3476
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:53,920
Goodbye.

3477
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:54,000
Goodbye.

3478
02:23:55,460 --> 02:23:56,980
Goodbye, goodbye.

3479
02:23:57,160 --> 02:23:58,180
Goodbye, goodbye.

3480
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:00,380
Goodbye, goodbye.

3481
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,960
I'm not a coward, guys!

3482
02:24:06,460 --> 02:24:07,220
Okay,

3483
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:14,600
it's a tactical retreat.

3484
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:17,800
It's a tactical retreat, guys.

3485
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:19,260
Oh my god!

3486
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:20,920
I'm okay.

3487
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:21,560
I'm okay.

3488
02:24:21,560 --> 02:24:22,760
I'm okay.

3489
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:24,020
I'm safe.

3490
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:26,020
I'm so safe.

3491
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:28,540
I feel so safe.

3492
02:24:29,220 --> 02:24:30,440
Oh my god.

3493
02:24:37,180 --> 02:24:38,440
That's right.

3494
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:41,320
Get backstabbed.

3495
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:44,000
I got bullied, so I bully you.

3496
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:47,880
Behold.

3497
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:48,840
God.

3498
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:50,600
Oh.

3499
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,800
I'm not gonna make that.

3500
02:24:56,880 --> 02:24:58,860
I continue the cycle.

3501
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:05,040
Time for left?

3502
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:07,360
Oh, okay.

3503
02:25:07,420 --> 02:25:08,160
I'll get that later.

3504
02:25:11,860 --> 02:25:12,920
Oh, there's a grace here.

3505
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:13,320
Nice.

3506
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:16,140
Oh, thank god.

3507
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:17,120
I found a grace.

3508
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:18,640
Thank fucking god.

3509
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:24,700
Alright, I wanna get that item.

3510
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:27,260
Like, right here.

3511
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:36,780
Okay, but there's a...

3512
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:39,420
There's an item right here, though.

3513
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:43,980
Yeah!

3514
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:46,860
I don't know what that is, but I'm grabbing it.

3515
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:47,300
Oh, hey.

3516
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:48,020
Yeah, that's right.

3517
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:48,820
I've killed your friend.

3518
02:25:50,200 --> 02:25:52,440
This makes me feel good about myself.

3519
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:54,520
Yeah, I feel stronger.

3520
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:56,600
I feel like the bigger man.

3521
02:25:57,560 --> 02:25:58,360
That's right.

3522
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:09,330
No down ahead.

3523
02:26:09,650 --> 02:26:11,050
Who said go down?

3524
02:26:15,750 --> 02:26:16,510
No down.

3525
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:17,750
You're like, go down.

3526
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:20,530
No down ahead.

3527
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:33,460
Alright, let's go this way.

3528
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:37,520
Try running.

3529
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:41,180
Oh!

3530
02:26:49,330 --> 02:26:51,830
Okay, now try running.

3531
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:57,070
Weeeee!

3532
02:26:59,310 --> 02:27:00,670
Weeeee!

3533
02:27:02,690 --> 02:27:03,390
That's fine.

3534
02:27:03,650 --> 02:27:04,410
That's fine.

3535
02:27:04,610 --> 02:27:04,950
That's fine.

3536
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:06,070
I just need to...

3537
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:07,090
Okay, I'll follow this.

3538
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:08,690
Open.

3539
02:27:08,830 --> 02:27:09,090
No!

3540
02:27:09,350 --> 02:27:09,550
Open!

3541
02:27:09,710 --> 02:27:09,990
No!

3542
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:10,530
Open!

3543
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:11,030
No!

3544
02:27:11,330 --> 02:27:12,410
I can't open from...

3545
02:27:12,410 --> 02:27:12,570
No!

3546
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:15,430
Okay.

3547
02:27:15,950 --> 02:27:16,250
Alright.

3548
02:27:16,470 --> 02:27:16,970
This way.

3549
02:27:18,170 --> 02:27:19,450
Okay, now go up.

3550
02:27:19,770 --> 02:27:20,490
Oh my god.

3551
02:27:20,750 --> 02:27:21,650
Oh my god.

3552
02:27:21,770 --> 02:27:22,550
What's going on?

3553
02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:24,150
And then I heal.

3554
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:25,430
Okay, and then...

3555
02:27:25,430 --> 02:27:26,230
Okay, it's fine.

3556
02:27:26,370 --> 02:27:26,650
It's fine.

3557
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:27,330
Everything's fine.

3558
02:27:27,330 --> 02:27:28,070
I dodged everything.

3559
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:28,830
Let's go.

3560
02:27:29,190 --> 02:27:30,170
Let's go.

3561
02:27:31,170 --> 02:27:32,550
There we go.

3562
02:27:33,310 --> 02:27:34,410
Oh, it's a wolf.

3563
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:37,550
Okay, that's fine.

3564
02:27:38,670 --> 02:27:39,210
Oh!

3565
02:27:40,070 --> 02:27:40,610
Hey.

3566
02:27:42,230 --> 02:27:43,470
Oh, hey!

3567
02:27:43,710 --> 02:27:44,450
Hey, buddy.

3568
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:47,090
Jesus Christ!

3569
02:27:48,330 --> 02:27:48,950
Oh!

3570
02:27:54,030 --> 02:27:54,750
Okay.

3571
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:56,510
I was not ready.

3572
02:27:56,670 --> 02:27:58,870
I was not ready for that.

3573
02:28:02,770 --> 02:28:05,050
This is the nerd I put in the locker.

3574
02:28:06,230 --> 02:28:07,970
Revenge for the dogs.

3575
02:28:09,210 --> 02:28:09,690
Alright.

3576
02:28:09,890 --> 02:28:10,630
No, I got this.

3577
02:28:11,230 --> 02:28:15,690
I was, like, trying to figure out what the fuck was going on, and then he killed me.

3578
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:19,490
My brain was, like, ten seconds behind.

3579
02:28:21,510 --> 02:28:22,810
Guys, it's not my fault!

3580
02:28:22,810 --> 02:28:26,670
My mind was ten seconds behind from what was actually happening.

3581
02:28:28,510 --> 02:28:30,170
That was a warm-up round.

3582
02:28:31,990 --> 02:28:32,930
Alright, here we go.

3583
02:28:33,130 --> 02:28:33,890
For real this time.

3584
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:37,310
Okay, and then I can do this.

3585
02:28:38,710 --> 02:28:40,610
Come here, my jellyfish!

3586
02:28:40,870 --> 02:28:41,430
Oh!

3587
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:44,870
I said, come here!

3588
02:28:47,250 --> 02:28:48,330
What the fuck?!

3589
02:28:51,030 --> 02:28:53,310
Why is he still trying to kill me?!

3590
02:28:54,190 --> 02:28:56,130
Oh my god, jellyfish!

3591
02:28:56,530 --> 02:29:00,110
Oh my god, jellyfish!

3592
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,600
Okay.

3593
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:04,280
Okay, that's good.

3594
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:06,200
That's good.

3595
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:07,000
He's distracted.

3596
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:09,060
Oh my- Not anymore!

3597
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,380
Oh my god, please.

3598
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:15,380
Please, he's so fast.

3599
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:22,800
It's, like, really fucked up because he's, like, going for him, running away from me, and then running towards me, and I'm- Every time.

3600
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:23,580
Please!

3601
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:25,100
Please!

3602
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:35,780
Please!

3603
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:35,920
Please!

3604
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:37,660
Oh my god, you fucker!

3605
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:40,780
He has no chance.

3606
02:29:43,020 --> 02:29:50,740
He goes back and- Okay, my jellyfish- My jellyfish is, like, maybe low-key fucking me up.

3607
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:51,520
I-

3608
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:59,800
My jellyfish is- My jellyfish is, like, fucking up the playstyle.

3609
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:02,120
Okay, no.

3610
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:06,160
I promise- I promise myself, I'll take him to endgame.

3611
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:14,340
Nobody believed in you, jellyfish, but me.

3612
02:30:14,340 --> 02:30:17,900
Even though I told you that you're fucking me up.

3613
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:21,280
Nobody believed in you, but me.

3614
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:24,260
I believe in you, jellyfish.

3615
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:27,040
Even though you're fucking up this run for me.

3616
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:29,880
Okay.

3617
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:32,880
I- Oh my god, that's me.

3618
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:37,540
Wow!

3619
02:30:45,130 --> 02:30:47,510
Please, I just- Let me shoot you!

3620
02:30:50,230 --> 02:30:50,750
Please!

3621
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:56,230
Oh my god, this stupid knife.

3622
02:30:58,470 --> 02:30:58,990
Okay.

3623
02:30:59,530 --> 02:31:01,430
I- That hits me!

3624
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:05,690
Stop jumping!

3625
02:31:06,350 --> 02:31:08,710
Oh my god, this fucker!

3626
02:31:08,930 --> 02:31:09,790
This fucker!

3627
02:31:15,370 --> 02:31:17,870
Oh my god, my jellyfish is dead.

3628
02:31:17,870 --> 02:31:19,990
I don't know what he did, but he's dead.

3629
02:31:21,890 --> 02:31:22,330
Okay.

3630
02:31:34,150 --> 02:31:36,990
Oh my god, I thought he was gonna do something else.

3631
02:31:37,330 --> 02:31:38,090
That's my bad.

3632
02:31:38,910 --> 02:31:41,050
That's my fucking bad for thinking that.

3633
02:31:43,210 --> 02:31:45,210
That's- Oh my god, I hate your moves!

3634
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:48,710
Okay.

3635
02:31:50,430 --> 02:31:51,070
Okay.

3636
02:31:51,070 --> 02:31:51,610
Oh my god.

3637
02:31:52,550 --> 02:31:53,730
I'm not downloading his moves.

3638
02:31:53,990 --> 02:31:56,370
I'm not downloading his moves right now!

3639
02:31:57,350 --> 02:31:57,850
Ah!

3640
02:31:58,030 --> 02:32:00,130
His rage baby man is working!

3641
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:08,060
Okay.

3642
02:32:11,410 --> 02:32:12,050
Okay.

3643
02:32:14,970 --> 02:32:16,010
Okay, nice.

3644
02:32:18,850 --> 02:32:19,690
You fucker.

3645
02:32:19,930 --> 02:32:20,770
I hate you.

3646
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:23,470
I wanna know where your family lives.

3647
02:32:25,810 --> 02:32:27,350
Where does your wife live?

3648
02:32:28,710 --> 02:32:29,130
Fix

3649
02:32:34,050 --> 02:32:34,510
me!

3650
02:32:34,890 --> 02:32:35,430
Oh!

3651
02:32:36,850 --> 02:32:37,730
Oh my god.

3652
02:32:38,110 --> 02:32:40,350
Influencer build is actually coming in clutch right now.

3653
02:32:40,490 --> 02:32:41,490
Oh my god!

3654
02:32:41,490 --> 02:32:42,250
Please!

3655
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:52,340
Jesus!

3656
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:53,200
I hate this combo!

3657
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:54,680
I hate this combo!

3658
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:01,880
What the fuck was

3659
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:07,220
that?!

3660
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:08,960
Oh, I used up everything.

3661
02:33:09,220 --> 02:33:09,560
It's fine.

3662
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:11,140
I still have my Influencer build.

3663
02:33:13,880 --> 02:33:14,440
Okay.

3664
02:33:17,300 --> 02:33:18,300
Jesus Christ.

3665
02:33:19,220 --> 02:33:20,600
Stupid back and forth.

3666
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:22,020
Oh my god.

3667
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:23,100
He has a third strike.

3668
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:24,800
You strike a third time?

3669
02:33:30,010 --> 02:33:30,570
Okay.

3670
02:33:32,910 --> 02:33:33,990
I hate you.

3671
02:33:35,090 --> 02:33:35,650
I

3672
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:42,360
can't hit you three times!

3673
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:47,580
You're such a fucker!

3674
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:49,260
You're actually such a whore!

3675
02:33:57,120 --> 02:33:58,100
Oh my god.

3676
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:01,280
If I wasn't a content creator, I'd be dead ten times already.

3677
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:01,700
I...

3678
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:02,060
I...

3679
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:02,820
I...

3680
02:34:02,820 --> 02:34:03,700
I...

3681
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:05,440
I...

3682
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:09,640
Oh!

3683
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:10,980
I'm keeping so greedy!

3684
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:11,800
I'm...

3685
02:34:11,800 --> 02:34:12,000
No!

3686
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:12,980
No!

3687
02:34:13,300 --> 02:34:13,400
No!

3688
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:13,620
Oh!

3689
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:17,880
That's right!

3690
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:21,360
You should've started streaming, little one!

3691
02:34:21,740 --> 02:34:25,260
If you started streaming, dog, you would've lived!

3692
02:34:25,740 --> 02:34:26,520
That's right!

3693
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,360
Get content created!

3694
02:34:31,320 --> 02:34:33,300
After 30 heals!

3695
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:34,500
I did...

3696
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:36,420
I did not deserve that win!

3697
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:39,380
I 100% did not deserve it!

3698
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:40,800
But I'll take it!

3699
02:34:41,180 --> 02:34:41,560
I...

3700
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:45,160
I found ten health bars!

3701
02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:46,020
Finally!

3702
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:47,600
You know those bosses?

3703
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:58,340
Where...

3704
02:34:58,340 --> 02:34:59,980
I can finally feel like an actual boss!

3705
02:35:00,140 --> 02:35:00,700
I...

3706
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:03,340
I...

3707
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:06,340
I...

3708
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:09,740
I can finally play like a fucking actual boss fight!

3709
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:12,460
I am the boss fight in the end!

3710
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:13,760
That's me!

3711
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:16,020
I'm the fucking boss fight!

3712
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:18,100
That they have to deal with!

3713
02:35:18,480 --> 02:35:18,900
I...

3714
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:19,180
I can...

3715
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:20,900
I am...

3716
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:27,360
Alright!

3717
02:35:29,300 --> 02:35:30,780
What do we upgrade guys?

3718
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:32,480
I...

3719
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:32,700
I...

3720
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:32,760
I...

3721
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:33,460
I knew...

3722
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:34,780
Dexterity?

3723
02:35:35,060 --> 02:35:35,680
Okay!

3724
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,400
We can upgrade two things!

3725
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:38,740
How many...

3726
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:39,580
How man...

3727
02:35:39,580 --> 02:35:41,240
How many phases does she have?

3728
02:35:45,330 --> 02:35:46,390
It's time...

3729
02:35:46,390 --> 02:35:47,030
Is it time...

3730
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,490
to pivot...

3731
02:35:47,490 --> 02:35:48,890
To big heavy hangover!

3732
02:35:49,910 --> 02:35:51,450
Yeah, I think it was a super chat!

3733
02:35:51,630 --> 02:35:51,890
Thank you!

3734
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:52,590
Thank you!

3735
02:35:52,890 --> 02:35:54,290
Two with dexterity?

3736
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:57,890
No dog was fighting all the fans.

3737
02:35:58,230 --> 02:36:01,790
It was like... it was 1v a thousand.

3738
02:36:03,870 --> 02:36:04,590
Alright.

3739
02:36:05,530 --> 02:36:07,090
Put two on dexterity.

3740
02:36:07,290 --> 02:36:08,530
Oh, we did it guys.

3741
02:36:08,930 --> 02:36:09,730
I'm crazy.

3742
02:36:10,430 --> 02:36:12,790
Thank you for the super chat.

3743
02:36:13,130 --> 02:36:14,030
Thank you, thank you.

3744
02:36:16,650 --> 02:36:18,330
Thank you for the super chat.

3745
02:36:18,450 --> 02:36:19,170
Thank you, thank you.

3746
02:36:19,330 --> 02:36:21,450
I'm not locked in here with you.

3747
02:36:21,610 --> 02:36:23,610
You're locked in here with me.

3748
02:36:25,870 --> 02:36:26,350
Alright.

3749
02:36:32,250 --> 02:36:33,630
What would be streaming?

3750
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:38,470
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3751
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:39,310
I got one.

3752
02:36:46,770 --> 02:36:47,590
Where is it?

3753
02:36:48,930 --> 02:36:50,370
Still no parrying.

3754
02:36:52,430 --> 02:36:53,070
No parrying.

3755
02:36:53,790 --> 02:36:55,650
Me, thank you for the 10 gift of shoes.

3756
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:56,870
Thank you, thank you.

3757
02:36:57,790 --> 02:36:58,850
Props, thank you for the super chat.

3758
02:36:58,950 --> 02:36:59,450
Thank you, thank you.

3759
02:36:59,530 --> 02:37:00,970
You can go back to the big water meal.

3760
02:37:02,470 --> 02:37:03,350
Go to the bottom.

3761
02:37:03,490 --> 02:37:05,250
Go eat... get eaten by the Iron Man.

3762
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:06,650
There is a fun secret there.

3763
02:37:06,810 --> 02:37:07,730
I'll do it...

3764
02:37:08,210 --> 02:37:09,150
...before I end stream.

3765
02:37:10,750 --> 02:37:11,810
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

3766
02:37:11,890 --> 02:37:12,790
Thank you, thank you.

3767
02:37:13,490 --> 02:37:14,390
Guess I'll go forward?

3768
02:37:14,910 --> 02:37:17,150
Go to that big scary castle over there?

3769
02:37:17,330 --> 02:37:18,050
Oh, guess I can.

3770
02:37:18,270 --> 02:37:18,950
Oh, wait, no, I can.

3771
02:37:20,630 --> 02:37:22,190
It is not fun.

3772
02:37:27,450 --> 02:37:28,670
Oh, I think it was super chat.

3773
02:37:28,790 --> 02:37:29,150
Thank you, thank you.

3774
02:37:29,250 --> 02:37:29,950
Oh, yeah, I got a key.

3775
02:37:30,990 --> 02:37:32,150
Get these guys out of here.

3776
02:37:32,830 --> 02:37:33,730
He's like, hey.

3777
02:37:34,830 --> 02:37:35,690
Why'd you kill him?

3778
02:37:38,970 --> 02:37:39,690
Oh, wait.

3779
02:37:43,970 --> 02:37:45,310
You got this, jellyfish.

3780
02:37:46,690 --> 02:37:47,610
I believe in you.

3781
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:48,530
Oh, my God.

3782
02:37:50,470 --> 02:37:51,730
I believe in him.

3783
02:37:54,870 --> 02:37:55,930
Oh, my God.

3784
02:37:56,030 --> 02:37:57,150
That guy almost baited me.

3785
02:37:58,890 --> 02:37:59,690
Holy shit.

3786
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:00,590
I do no damage.

3787
02:38:00,870 --> 02:38:02,190
I do no damage, guys.

3788
02:38:02,630 --> 02:38:02,920
I do...

3789
02:38:06,050 --> 02:38:07,070
Wait a minute.

3790
02:38:07,390 --> 02:38:09,010
I don't do any damage.

3791
02:38:18,740 --> 02:38:21,360
How do I kill him if I don't do damage?

3792
02:38:24,060 --> 02:38:25,020
Holy shit.

3793
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:26,180
Okay, I leave.

3794
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:27,580
No, no.

3795
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:28,340
You got this.

3796
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:29,460
Oh, he's dead.

3797
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:32,740
Oh, hey, guys.

3798
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:42,880
Okay,

3799
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:46,500
let me...

3800
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:47,940
Let me just go over here.

3801
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:49,740
I'm going to leave now.

3802
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:53,680
Toki, it's half health.

3803
02:38:53,740 --> 02:38:54,400
You can do this.

3804
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:55,340
Okay, wait.

3805
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:56,980
Wait, I can?

3806
02:38:57,380 --> 02:38:58,840
You guys really believe in me?

3807
02:38:59,670 --> 02:39:00,620
Wait, where am I?

3808
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,000
Oh, what the fuck?

3809
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:04,920
Wait, I'm inside him!

3810
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:07,840
How the fuck did he get me?

3811
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:14,200
I jumped inside.

3812
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:19,280
I didn't even know I got inside.

3813
02:39:20,240 --> 02:39:21,440
All right, I'm leaving.

3814
02:39:21,660 --> 02:39:22,580
Oh, shit!

3815
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:24,100
Okay, now I'm leaving.

3816
02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:27,480
Okay, I'm leaving.

3817
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:29,840
For real now.

3818
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:33,120
Wait, he seems like a fun guy.

3819
02:39:36,220 --> 02:39:37,640
Oh, never mind.

3820
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:38,420
Never mind.

3821
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:39,140
Never mind.

3822
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:39,780
Not friendly.

3823
02:39:40,020 --> 02:39:40,720
Not friendly.

3824
02:39:40,940 --> 02:39:41,620
Not friendly.

3825
02:39:41,820 --> 02:39:42,500
Not friendly!

3826
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:46,040
Okay, to be fair, I thought we were friends.

3827
02:39:46,220 --> 02:39:47,280
Because I didn't see anything.

3828
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:51,380
I thought we were friends.

3829
02:39:54,280 --> 02:39:56,800
I legitimately thought we were going to be best of friends.

3830
02:40:00,850 --> 02:40:01,530
Goodness.

3831
02:40:05,260 --> 02:40:06,000
All right.

3832
02:40:08,460 --> 02:40:10,080
No way this magic hits there.

3833
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:11,980
Oh!

3834
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:17,100
There was a way, guys.

3835
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:20,160
There was indeed a way.

3836
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,780
There was a way.

3837
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:23,620
Oh my god.

3838
02:40:23,740 --> 02:40:24,100
No!

3839
02:40:24,620 --> 02:40:26,300
He one-shot me!

3840
02:40:29,050 --> 02:40:30,420
Oh my god!

3841
02:40:31,580 --> 02:40:34,440
It actually one-shot me.

3842
02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:37,260
Get her next.

3843
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:40,440
I didn't think it would happen.

3844
02:40:41,410 --> 02:40:43,460
I don't even know where I am.

3845
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:44,520
Oh, it's swift.

3846
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:46,780
Okay, I know where I died.

3847
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:46,800
What?

3848
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:50,320
The nerds fight back.

3849
02:40:51,340 --> 02:40:53,560
Who showed these nerds how to fight?

3850
02:40:58,240 --> 02:40:59,880
Okay, I figured it out though.

3851
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:03,780
All right.

3852
02:41:04,060 --> 02:41:04,760
They saw me.

3853
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:06,700
They're slowly wandering over.

3854
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:09,400
Wait, they all saw me.

3855
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:10,480
Wait a minute.

3856
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:11,700
How did you all saw me?

3857
02:41:13,420 --> 02:41:15,160
What's the boss now?

3858
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:18,620
Oh my god.

3859
02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:19,880
Wait, how did he see me?

3860
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:26,350
Okay.

3861
02:41:29,090 --> 02:41:29,730
Oh my god.

3862
02:41:29,810 --> 02:41:30,030
That's fine.

3863
02:41:30,190 --> 02:41:30,450
That's fine.

3864
02:41:30,630 --> 02:41:30,930
That's fine.

3865
02:41:32,950 --> 02:41:33,990
I just gotta kill him.

3866
02:41:34,410 --> 02:41:35,030
That's okay.

3867
02:41:37,890 --> 02:41:38,570
That's okay.

3868
02:41:41,150 --> 02:41:42,350
Thank you for the super chat.

3869
02:41:42,350 --> 02:41:43,170
Thank you, thank you.

3870
02:41:43,290 --> 02:41:46,450
Imagine getting killed by a nerd.

3871
02:41:49,100 --> 02:41:49,490
Okay.

3872
02:41:50,130 --> 02:41:50,710
Bye.

3873
02:41:53,100 --> 02:41:53,970
Oh my god.

3874
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:55,010
Oh my god!

3875
02:41:55,170 --> 02:41:56,650
He just slowly backed away!

3876
02:41:58,530 --> 02:41:59,650
That's cheating!

3877
02:42:01,670 --> 02:42:03,030
Oh my god.

3878
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:07,130
He just slowly backed away!

3879
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:11,190
Oh.

3880
02:42:13,130 --> 02:42:13,810
Yeah.

3881
02:42:15,930 --> 02:42:16,610
Yeah.

3882
02:42:19,630 --> 02:42:20,610
Right, nerd.

3883
02:42:21,050 --> 02:42:21,970
That's right!

3884
02:42:24,710 --> 02:42:26,930
Okay, now I can lose- loot this.

3885
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:28,790
All right, there's the jar.

3886
02:42:30,150 --> 02:42:31,510
Oh, I got another crackpot.

3887
02:42:31,870 --> 02:42:32,250
Nice.

3888
02:42:33,270 --> 02:42:34,270
Take that, nerd.

3889
02:42:34,950 --> 02:42:35,910
That's fucking right.

3890
02:42:37,430 --> 02:42:38,390
Did it.

3891
02:42:39,490 --> 02:42:41,870
I don't know how, but I did it.

3892
02:42:43,190 --> 02:42:45,230
I don't fucking...

3893
02:42:45,790 --> 02:42:46,250
Push it.

3894
02:42:46,430 --> 02:42:47,470
Oh, shit!

3895
02:42:49,490 --> 02:42:50,450
I got baited.

3896
02:42:50,710 --> 02:42:52,710
I got baited by the nerds again.

3897
02:42:53,290 --> 02:42:54,410
I fucking...

3898
02:42:55,810 --> 02:42:56,470
Okay, that's it.

3899
02:42:56,590 --> 02:42:57,650
I'm taking my anger out on you.

3900
02:42:59,530 --> 02:43:00,970
Continue the cycle.

3901
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:06,320
And that's fine.

3902
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:10,240
That's not fine.

3903
02:43:14,420 --> 02:43:14,940
Okay.

3904
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:16,640
Okay, I...

3905
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:18,200
Okay, give me a sec.

3906
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:19,720
Let me figure out what to do.

3907
02:43:33,370 --> 02:43:33,890
Okay.

3908
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:42,160
I didn't figure it out, guys.

3909
02:43:48,650 --> 02:43:49,130
Okay.

3910
02:43:49,130 --> 02:43:50,090
All right, take this.

3911
02:43:51,490 --> 02:43:52,450
You got...

3912
02:43:53,990 --> 02:43:55,210
Oh, my God.

3913
02:43:59,380 --> 02:43:59,860
Okay.

3914
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:01,400
Do I have arrows?

3915
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:03,180
I don't think I have any arrows.

3916
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:05,080
Let me check.

3917
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:05,920
Oh, I do.

3918
02:44:06,900 --> 02:44:07,780
Oh, my God.

3919
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:08,500
I don't...

3920
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:09,260
Never mind.

3921
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:10,900
I don't think it's worth it.

3922
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:14,280
I don't think it's worth it.

3923
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:16,520
Okay, they're...

3924
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:17,540
Oh, my God.

3925
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:20,000
They're just spamming me.

3926
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:21,040
That's cheating.

3927
02:44:21,300 --> 02:44:22,080
Okay, let me...

3928
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:23,480
Let me get my...

3929
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:24,040
Oh, my God.

3930
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:25,400
Okay, I got this.

3931
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:26,880
I need the element of surprise.

3932
02:44:31,990 --> 02:44:32,570
All right.

3933
02:44:32,790 --> 02:44:33,710
I figured this out.

3934
02:44:36,670 --> 02:44:37,250
All right.

3935
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:39,470
I also don't remember how to use my bow.

3936
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:40,430
All right.

3937
02:44:50,030 --> 02:44:51,530
I know what to do.

3938
02:44:51,970 --> 02:44:53,330
I don't know what to do.

3939
02:44:59,710 --> 02:45:00,190
Okay.

3940
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:01,850
Give me a sec.

3941
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:06,420
Wait.

3942
02:45:06,820 --> 02:45:06,920
Wait.

3943
02:45:08,720 --> 02:45:09,200
Okay.

3944
02:45:09,500 --> 02:45:10,460
They're getting involved, though.

3945
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:11,160
They shouldn't be.

3946
02:45:11,800 --> 02:45:12,500
Give me a sec.

3947
02:45:12,740 --> 02:45:13,260
Okay, now.

3948
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:15,140
Now I know what to do.

3949
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:17,320
No, I have arrows.

3950
02:45:17,320 --> 02:45:17,500
Look at this.

3951
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:18,540
See?

3952
02:45:20,760 --> 02:45:21,360
Oh, wait.

3953
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:21,880
I don't.

3954
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:22,140
Wait.

3955
02:45:22,260 --> 02:45:22,560
No, see?

3956
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:23,020
I do.

3957
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:23,500
Oh, wait.

3958
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:24,020
I don't.

3959
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:28,980
Never mind.

3960
02:45:31,140 --> 02:45:31,920
It's time.

3961
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:33,140
Three.

3962
02:45:34,220 --> 02:45:34,620
Two.

3963
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:36,480
Okay.

3964
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:37,240
Three.

3965
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:37,300
Three.

3966
02:45:37,500 --> 02:45:37,900
Two.

3967
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:38,380
One.

3968
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:38,860
Let's go.

3969
02:45:47,240 --> 02:45:47,760
One.

3970
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:47,840
One.

3971
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:48,260
What you see?

3972
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:53,400
It wasn't that way.

3973
02:45:53,620 --> 02:45:54,760
It wasn't that way.

3974
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:04,600
Guys, we gotta reset this.

3975
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:05,220
Okay, wait.

3976
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:06,020
Okay.

3977
02:46:08,800 --> 02:46:09,320
Okay.

3978
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:12,320
Oh, there was?

3979
02:46:12,700 --> 02:46:15,300
I had to jump the... Okay, gotta reset.

3980
02:46:15,580 --> 02:46:18,040
I wasn't paying attention because I was panicking.

3981
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:19,960
I don't know if that was noticeable, guys.

3982
02:46:20,140 --> 02:46:20,640
I...

3983
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:32,400
I don't know if it was noticeable, but I may have been panicking.

3984
02:46:33,060 --> 02:46:35,660
I didn't see the other pathway.

3985
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:39,220
But let me get rid of these guys first before I do anything.

3986
02:46:40,700 --> 02:46:42,700
Yeah, it was not that noticeable, right?

3987
02:46:42,980 --> 02:46:43,680
It wasn't, right?

3988
02:46:43,980 --> 02:46:45,000
I didn't think so.

3989
02:46:45,420 --> 02:46:46,300
Okay, I can do this again.

3990
02:46:48,980 --> 02:46:49,460
Okay.

3991
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:49,480
Okay.

3992
02:46:50,700 --> 02:46:51,540
Oh my god, it's right here.

3993
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:52,740
Whoa!

3994
02:46:54,440 --> 02:46:54,920
Oh!

3995
02:46:55,160 --> 02:46:55,900
Oh, dang!

3996
02:46:57,560 --> 02:46:58,200
Okay.

3997
02:46:58,720 --> 02:46:59,180
Okay.

3998
02:46:59,180 --> 02:46:59,180
Bye.

3999
02:46:59,660 --> 02:47:00,640
We did it.

4000
02:47:02,100 --> 02:47:03,460
Okay, we figured it out.

4001
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:06,220
And now I can open this door.

4002
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:08,080
There we go.

4003
02:47:08,880 --> 02:47:09,600
There we go.

4004
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:13,260
That's right.

4005
02:47:13,420 --> 02:47:15,440
No time to use your magic now, nerd.

4006
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:16,960
That's fucking right!

4007
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:18,660
Aha!

4008
02:47:19,820 --> 02:47:22,780
I beat the nerds at their own game.

4009
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:26,340
Wait.

4010
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:26,880
Wait.

4011
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:27,640
This is not the path?

4012
02:47:28,140 --> 02:47:28,840
Wait a minute.

4013
02:47:29,080 --> 02:47:30,420
Then why the fuck did I go here?

4014
02:47:31,540 --> 02:47:32,120
Oh, wait.

4015
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:33,100
There's another path here.

4016
02:47:41,230 --> 02:47:42,630
Oh, is it parkour time?

4017
02:47:43,510 --> 02:47:43,990
Parkour.

4018
02:47:45,390 --> 02:47:46,250
I got this.

4019
02:47:46,350 --> 02:47:46,730
Watch this.

4020
02:47:49,270 --> 02:47:50,670
Oh, he did say try jumping.

4021
02:47:52,530 --> 02:47:53,390
Item ahead?

4022
02:47:55,310 --> 02:47:57,370
Why is it always something incredible?

4023
02:47:59,270 --> 02:47:59,750
Parkour.

4024
02:48:00,250 --> 02:48:01,370
Time to do a flip.

4025
02:48:03,090 --> 02:48:03,730
Alright.

4026
02:48:04,130 --> 02:48:04,470
Alright.

4027
02:48:04,470 --> 02:48:05,050
Up I go.

4028
02:48:05,950 --> 02:48:07,870
I'm not afraid of these guys.

4029
02:48:12,020 --> 02:48:13,240
Oh my god.

4030
02:48:14,040 --> 02:48:15,240
Oh my god.

4031
02:48:15,460 --> 02:48:15,980
Oh my god.

4032
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:15,980
Okay.

4033
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:17,440
Okay.

4034
02:48:17,620 --> 02:48:17,920
I'm okay.

4035
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:19,020
I'm okay.

4036
02:48:19,940 --> 02:48:20,580
I'm okay.

4037
02:48:20,580 --> 02:48:21,640
Wait, where's the arrow guy?

4038
02:48:22,520 --> 02:48:23,540
Where did he go?

4039
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:27,480
He like... What?

4040
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:29,960
Okay.

4041
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:31,660
How the fuck does that hit me?

4042
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:34,480
He's just slowly backing in the corner.

4043
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:34,560
He's just slowly backing in the corner.

4044
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:39,460
What the fuck is he doing?

4045
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:43,020
Oh my god.

4046
02:48:43,180 --> 02:48:44,780
Is that... Am I gonna be okay?

4047
02:48:45,880 --> 02:48:46,400
Okay?

4048
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:52,360
Guys, you think I'm gonna live?

4049
02:48:55,380 --> 02:48:59,240
Bro, it's just... Bro, I think that hit the heart.

4050
02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:02,160
It looks like a heart.

4051
02:49:02,160 --> 02:49:02,160
Okay.

4052
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:03,860
Oh my god.

4053
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:03,920
Oh my god.

4054
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:04,520
I almost jumped off.

4055
02:49:04,820 --> 02:49:06,700
I actually almost jumped off.

4056
02:49:08,140 --> 02:49:10,420
I wanted it to look cool.

4057
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:12,680
I almost jumped off.

4058
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:17,660
There's no way.

4059
02:49:17,740 --> 02:49:18,900
I don't fucking believe you.

4060
02:49:19,300 --> 02:49:21,080
I... It's just...

4061
02:49:26,470 --> 02:49:27,610
Not here?

4062
02:49:28,210 --> 02:49:30,170
Wait, it is the right jump?

4063
02:49:31,310 --> 02:49:32,290
I believe.

4064
02:49:33,930 --> 02:49:35,070
Right on my head.

4065
02:49:35,070 --> 02:49:35,750
Oh, right here.

4066
02:49:39,750 --> 02:49:40,530
Oh, nice.

4067
02:49:40,710 --> 02:49:41,670
More golden runes.

4068
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:42,390
I need those.

4069
02:49:44,650 --> 02:49:45,170
Okay.

4070
02:49:56,360 --> 02:49:57,980
There's a ladder, you fuckers.

4071
02:49:57,980 --> 02:50:01,080
I was so ready.

4072
02:50:01,320 --> 02:50:01,600
I...

4073
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:04,420
I was ready to do it.

4074
02:50:04,520 --> 02:50:05,720
I was gonna do it.

4075
02:50:09,720 --> 02:50:10,260
I...

4076
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:12,060
I was actually...

4077
02:50:12,060 --> 02:50:13,620
I was just gonna do it.

4078
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:15,900
I wasn't gonna question anything.

4079
02:50:19,100 --> 02:50:20,120
Oh, him.

4080
02:50:22,780 --> 02:50:23,960
Oh, you...

4081
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:26,200
I didn't see you, huh?

4082
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:27,580
Oh my god.

4083
02:50:27,780 --> 02:50:28,880
Oh my god.

4084
02:50:28,900 --> 02:50:29,400
It's you.

4085
02:50:29,780 --> 02:50:31,220
It's one of these guys.

4086
02:50:38,420 --> 02:50:39,180
That's right.

4087
02:50:39,560 --> 02:50:40,020
What?

4088
02:50:40,380 --> 02:50:41,120
Oh my god.

4089
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:42,100
Oh my god.

4090
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:44,360
He baited me.

4091
02:50:44,580 --> 02:50:45,860
He actually baited me.

4092
02:50:50,450 --> 02:50:50,970
He's...

4093
02:50:50,970 --> 02:50:51,930
I don't have a summon.

4094
02:50:55,310 --> 02:50:57,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4095
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:04,800
Fucking right.

4096
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:06,020
Get in this corner.

4097
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:07,480
Oh no.

4098
02:51:09,140 --> 02:51:10,280
Oh my god.

4099
02:51:10,280 --> 02:51:10,840
Get out here.

4100
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:11,780
You're not bleeding me.

4101
02:51:14,480 --> 02:51:15,780
Okay, that shouldn't hit me.

4102
02:51:20,510 --> 02:51:21,030
Okay.

4103
02:51:23,210 --> 02:51:24,510
Are you serious?

4104
02:51:24,870 --> 02:51:26,870
Wait, does your mana expire?

4105
02:51:29,870 --> 02:51:30,850
Okay, we're fine.

4106
02:51:33,410 --> 02:51:35,770
Oh, the fuck did he have so much mana?

4107
02:51:38,390 --> 02:51:39,650
Here we go this way.

4108
02:51:40,510 --> 02:51:41,090
Never.

4109
02:51:44,210 --> 02:51:45,950
That's the funny part, Doki.

4110
02:51:46,150 --> 02:51:47,410
They never expire.

4111
02:51:48,730 --> 02:51:49,850
Can't mute your butt.

4112
02:51:55,560 --> 02:51:56,460
All right.

4113
02:51:57,920 --> 02:51:59,180
Let's do this here.

4114
02:51:59,380 --> 02:52:01,100
Why did so many people die here, though?

4115
02:52:06,950 --> 02:52:08,590
He's got a book.

4116
02:52:09,430 --> 02:52:11,210
He reads, Doki.

4117
02:52:15,480 --> 02:52:16,660
What the fuck?

4118
02:52:18,220 --> 02:52:20,360
I don't feel like it is that way.

4119
02:52:25,550 --> 02:52:27,010
Must be another way.

4120
02:52:29,530 --> 02:52:31,970
Is it really across those roofs?

4121
02:52:33,130 --> 02:52:35,690
It's like, if only I had a ladder.

4122
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:45,520
Try it down.

4123
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:46,600
And then...

4124
02:52:50,460 --> 02:52:51,740
And then what?

4125
02:53:01,110 --> 02:53:01,790
Okay.

4126
02:53:03,630 --> 02:53:05,370
How did all these people die?

4127
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:09,900
Oh.

4128
02:53:10,260 --> 02:53:10,720
Oh.

4129
02:53:11,940 --> 02:53:13,340
That makes sense.

4130
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:15,540
That is...

4131
02:53:22,900 --> 02:53:23,640
Yes.

4132
02:53:27,050 --> 02:53:27,790
Okay.

4133
02:53:34,370 --> 02:53:35,110
Hello.

4134
02:53:41,350 --> 02:53:41,890
First.

4135
02:53:42,590 --> 02:53:42,970
First.

4136
02:53:43,110 --> 02:53:43,450
Oh!

4137
02:53:43,670 --> 02:53:44,390
What the fuck?

4138
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:51,300
Oh my god, he's bugging out.

4139
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:52,820
He's actually glitching out right now.

4140
02:53:53,420 --> 02:53:55,900
Oh my god, like, he's just vibrating.

4141
02:53:56,860 --> 02:53:58,640
He's like, stuck on the roof.

4142
02:54:03,180 --> 02:54:04,680
What does he mean, like?

4143
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:08,020
First off, left?

4144
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:09,820
Like, do I drop here?

4145
02:54:11,140 --> 02:54:13,280
What does he mean, left side?

4146
02:54:20,140 --> 02:54:20,740
Huh?

4147
02:54:23,420 --> 02:54:24,720
So lonely.

4148
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:27,060
Lonely.

4149
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:29,340
Mr. Lonely.

4150
02:54:30,020 --> 02:54:32,080
I have no body.

4151
02:54:33,080 --> 02:54:34,000
Come on.

4152
02:54:35,480 --> 02:54:36,640
I got this this way.

4153
02:54:37,200 --> 02:54:37,540
Oh, wait.

4154
02:54:37,580 --> 02:54:38,280
There is an item here.

4155
02:54:42,280 --> 02:54:43,400
Oh, I got a sword.

4156
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:44,760
I got a sword key.

4157
02:54:46,300 --> 02:54:47,920
Okay, but what if I jump there?

4158
02:54:48,560 --> 02:54:49,300
No, don't do it.

4159
02:54:49,380 --> 02:54:50,800
Don't let the intrusive thoughts win.

4160
02:54:53,260 --> 02:54:55,280
Don't let them win, doki.

4161
02:54:59,380 --> 02:55:00,600
There's a ladder here.

4162
02:55:06,690 --> 02:55:07,650
What's over here?

4163
02:55:12,670 --> 02:55:14,290
Where the fuck am I?

4164
02:55:14,690 --> 02:55:15,870
Oh, hey, there's an item.

4165
02:55:17,910 --> 02:55:18,350
There's...

4166
02:55:18,350 --> 02:55:20,210
Oh my god, the crabs are eating him.

4167
02:55:21,810 --> 02:55:23,510
What if I kill one of your friends?

4168
02:55:25,730 --> 02:55:27,210
Oh, I get nothing out of it.

4169
02:55:27,350 --> 02:55:27,730
Never mind.

4170
02:55:33,110 --> 02:55:34,030
Okay, back up.

4171
02:55:34,130 --> 02:55:35,030
Now I go back up.

4172
02:55:35,650 --> 02:55:36,310
It's okay.

4173
02:55:37,270 --> 02:55:39,290
That other friend was, like, the third wheel.

4174
02:55:40,330 --> 02:55:41,650
Now they can...

4175
02:55:45,390 --> 02:55:47,210
It was the third wheel.

4176
02:55:47,690 --> 02:55:49,350
That couple's gonna thank me.

4177
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:55,800
Now they can get freaky.

4178
02:55:57,860 --> 02:55:59,340
Did I jump through this room?

4179
02:55:59,620 --> 02:56:00,120
I don't know.

4180
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:01,120
There's, like, guys here.

4181
02:56:04,120 --> 02:56:04,900
I'm gonna do it.

4182
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:08,140
I don't know where else to go.

4183
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:12,920
I don't think he heard me.

4184
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:14,880
Guys, he heard me.

4185
02:56:17,020 --> 02:56:18,000
Oh my god!

4186
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:18,980
What the fuck?

4187
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:19,720
It was a trap!

4188
02:56:27,390 --> 02:56:28,950
What's he gonna do now?

4189
02:56:30,630 --> 02:56:32,550
Aha, I'm on the other side.

4190
02:56:33,890 --> 02:56:35,210
Wait, he's following me.

4191
02:56:37,110 --> 02:56:38,910
Aha, what you gonna do now?

4192
02:56:39,670 --> 02:56:41,810
Aha, oh shit!

4193
02:56:42,470 --> 02:56:42,510
Oh shit, haha!

4194
02:56:45,030 --> 02:56:46,030
Can't catch me!

4195
02:56:47,230 --> 02:56:48,690
Oh shit, maybe he can.

4196
02:56:49,250 --> 02:56:54,070
Aha, the AI's confused now!

4197
02:56:54,630 --> 02:56:55,990
Oh wait, there's an item over here.

4198
02:56:59,710 --> 02:57:00,370
Oh nice!

4199
02:57:01,010 --> 02:57:03,370
Haha, they don't know what to do.

4200
02:57:05,290 --> 02:57:06,390
Oh no, they split up.

4201
02:57:06,390 --> 02:57:07,250
Wait.

4202
02:57:09,570 --> 02:57:10,630
That's not good.

4203
02:57:11,430 --> 02:57:12,470
Wait, where do I go?

4204
02:57:16,550 --> 02:57:19,490
Oh my god, what the fuck was that?!

4205
02:57:25,370 --> 02:57:27,750
I'm so sick.

4206
02:57:29,290 --> 02:57:30,570
Can't catch me.

4207
02:57:31,850 --> 02:57:32,850
Watch this.

4208
02:57:35,370 --> 02:57:36,230
That's right.

4209
02:57:36,670 --> 02:57:37,670
Where am I?

4210
02:57:38,250 --> 02:57:39,810
I don't know.

4211
02:57:40,390 --> 02:57:41,390
Where did I...

4212
02:57:42,350 --> 02:57:43,710
Drop Chandelier!

4213
02:57:43,730 --> 02:57:45,270
There was a right doll!

4214
02:57:45,850 --> 02:57:47,670
I don't even know where I am!

4215
02:57:49,470 --> 02:57:50,610
Where did I go?

4216
02:57:50,710 --> 02:57:51,770
Who's that guy?

4217
02:57:53,630 --> 02:57:56,710
Oh, he does... Oh, he... Oh my god!

4218
02:57:56,870 --> 02:57:58,630
He definitely does not look friendly!

4219
02:57:59,210 --> 02:57:59,370
Oh!

4220
02:58:01,850 --> 02:58:02,530
No!

4221
02:58:06,150 --> 02:58:07,630
Oh my god!

4222
02:58:09,810 --> 02:58:10,910
I'm dead.

4223
02:58:13,350 --> 02:58:14,490
Where am I?

4224
02:58:14,970 --> 02:58:17,170
I don't want to do this all over here.

4225
02:58:17,690 --> 02:58:17,950
No!

4226
02:58:21,350 --> 02:58:23,010
Oh my god.

4227
02:58:23,810 --> 02:58:24,070
Okay.

4228
02:58:24,510 --> 02:58:25,830
Okay, I know where to go now.

4229
02:58:26,490 --> 02:58:28,270
No, I can get those runes again.

4230
02:58:28,550 --> 02:58:29,770
Guys, I can get it.

4231
02:58:30,110 --> 02:58:30,950
Don't worry.

4232
02:58:31,670 --> 02:58:32,530
I believe.

4233
02:58:32,930 --> 02:58:35,070
You just gotta believe, guys.

4234
02:58:35,470 --> 02:58:37,810
I realized I didn't have to go this way.

4235
02:58:38,210 --> 02:58:39,310
But it's too late.

4236
02:58:39,430 --> 02:58:40,170
I'm in too deep.

4237
02:58:41,610 --> 02:58:42,230
Ow!

4238
02:58:43,070 --> 02:58:43,350
Ow!

4239
02:58:46,130 --> 02:58:46,990
It's fine.

4240
02:58:48,170 --> 02:58:49,150
I believe.

4241
02:58:50,830 --> 02:58:53,470
It feels like 20 years since I was here.

4242
02:58:53,950 --> 02:58:54,930
But I remember.

4243
02:58:57,050 --> 02:58:58,630
Wait, I don't remember.

4244
02:58:59,570 --> 02:58:59,930
Wait.

4245
02:59:00,070 --> 02:59:00,930
Oh, I remember!

4246
02:59:04,070 --> 02:59:04,690
JK!

4247
02:59:07,150 --> 02:59:08,250
Oh my god!

4248
02:59:08,370 --> 02:59:08,810
Okay, it's fine.

4249
02:59:08,970 --> 02:59:09,970
Oh my god!

4250
02:59:10,130 --> 02:59:10,490
It's fine!

4251
02:59:11,050 --> 02:59:12,490
It's... I'm so healthy.

4252
02:59:12,710 --> 02:59:13,510
Oh my god!

4253
02:59:13,670 --> 02:59:13,850
It's okay.

4254
02:59:13,990 --> 02:59:14,850
My ass is okay.

4255
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:15,950
It's just my ass.

4256
02:59:17,090 --> 02:59:18,670
It's extra cushioned.

4257
02:59:18,690 --> 02:59:19,310
Don't worry.

4258
02:59:24,110 --> 02:59:27,630
My ass is like extremely cushioned for this.

4259
02:59:28,050 --> 02:59:28,510
It's okay.

4260
02:59:31,250 --> 02:59:34,690
It was trained for this one moment.

4261
02:59:36,130 --> 02:59:37,670
I'm thick as hell.

4262
02:59:42,330 --> 02:59:44,510
Alright, it's here.

4263
02:59:45,570 --> 02:59:46,150
Here.

4264
02:59:47,010 --> 02:59:47,810
Here.

4265
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:52,400
Here.

4266
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:53,760
Here.

4267
02:59:53,820 --> 02:59:55,180
Here.

4268
02:59:55,320 --> 02:59:55,320
Here.

4269
02:59:56,480 --> 03:00:00,840
Okay, next time I won't, uh...

4270
03:00:01,940 --> 03:00:06,200
I will not, like, engage in the... in the... in that.

4271
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:11,180
Where did I drop last time?

4272
03:00:11,380 --> 03:00:12,020
Here, right?

4273
03:00:12,620 --> 03:00:13,080
Oh, hey!

4274
03:00:13,140 --> 03:00:13,840
There's an item here.

4275
03:00:15,180 --> 03:00:16,060
Wait, where did I drop?

4276
03:00:16,160 --> 03:00:17,300
Oh my god!

4277
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:18,300
I got that item.

4278
03:00:18,460 --> 03:00:18,820
Okay, guys.

4279
03:00:18,960 --> 03:00:20,420
I need to get my other stuff first.

4280
03:00:27,810 --> 03:00:28,630
It's gonna be worth it.

4281
03:00:30,790 --> 03:00:31,950
Hello, sir.

4282
03:00:37,290 --> 03:00:38,210
Oh my god.

4283
03:00:38,370 --> 03:00:39,290
Wait, I...

4284
03:00:40,070 --> 03:00:41,770
My soul is literally right there.

4285
03:00:41,890 --> 03:00:42,250
No!

4286
03:00:42,830 --> 03:00:43,190
No!

4287
03:00:57,020 --> 03:01:00,930
I forgot what color it was.

4288
03:01:00,930 --> 03:01:01,390
I...

4289
03:01:02,850 --> 03:01:05,050
Now I have to...

4290
03:01:05,050 --> 03:01:06,870
I ran past it.

4291
03:01:06,950 --> 03:01:08,410
I was like, wait a minute.

4292
03:01:08,870 --> 03:01:10,510
Wait, that's not my...

4293
03:01:10,510 --> 03:01:11,850
Wait a minute.

4294
03:01:12,290 --> 03:01:14,510
I just ran past my soul.

4295
03:01:14,750 --> 03:01:15,630
I forgot.

4296
03:01:15,950 --> 03:01:17,830
I forgot what it looked like.

4297
03:01:18,010 --> 03:01:21,530
Guys, I actually forgot what it looked like.

4298
03:01:22,050 --> 03:01:23,030
Oh my god.

4299
03:01:23,530 --> 03:01:25,190
I was like, wait a minute.

4300
03:01:25,670 --> 03:01:27,490
Where those my souls over there?

4301
03:01:27,990 --> 03:01:28,490
I...

4302
03:01:28,490 --> 03:01:30,590
That's why I turned around.

4303
03:01:30,930 --> 03:01:32,610
That's why I turned around.

4304
03:01:32,910 --> 03:01:34,510
I was like, oh shit.

4305
03:01:34,650 --> 03:01:36,790
Wait, I think that's the right soul back there.

4306
03:01:37,310 --> 03:01:37,810
I...

4307
03:01:42,330 --> 03:01:42,890
Okay.

4308
03:01:43,530 --> 03:01:45,090
Now I have nothing.

4309
03:01:45,150 --> 03:01:46,230
Oh my god.

4310
03:01:46,450 --> 03:01:47,490
It dodges.

4311
03:01:48,210 --> 03:01:50,610
Now I have nothing to lose.

4312
03:01:52,630 --> 03:01:53,850
Okay, it's fine.

4313
03:01:54,070 --> 03:01:55,290
I have nothing to lose now.

4314
03:01:56,030 --> 03:01:58,370
Guys, I have nothing to lose.

4315
03:01:58,950 --> 03:02:00,770
Are you sure you can't believe it?

4316
03:02:00,770 --> 03:02:01,610
Because I can.

4317
03:02:03,170 --> 03:02:05,230
That seems like something I do.

4318
03:02:06,850 --> 03:02:07,390
Alright.

4319
03:02:09,290 --> 03:02:11,870
I have no pressure anymore.

4320
03:02:19,250 --> 03:02:20,690
No more pressure.

4321
03:02:23,350 --> 03:02:24,490
Alright, here we go.

4322
03:02:26,870 --> 03:02:29,110
I was going to say, how did you not believe it?

4323
03:02:29,110 --> 03:02:31,150
I fucking think that was the first thing I do.

4324
03:02:33,790 --> 03:02:35,750
That was the first thing I think I do.

4325
03:02:39,140 --> 03:02:40,180
And then here.

4326
03:02:40,620 --> 03:02:42,000
Back at it again.

4327
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:47,060
Now I have no fear.

4328
03:02:48,960 --> 03:02:51,140
Can't fear something I don't have.

4329
03:02:53,660 --> 03:02:56,280
Okay, now I know which chandelier to jump on.

4330
03:02:56,520 --> 03:02:56,740
Guys.

4331
03:02:57,320 --> 03:02:58,220
I know now.

4332
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:06,180
There you go.

4333
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:08,680
There's the chandelier.

4334
03:03:12,230 --> 03:03:12,790
Alright.

4335
03:03:14,070 --> 03:03:14,390
Nice.

4336
03:03:14,910 --> 03:03:14,950
Nice.

4337
03:03:14,950 --> 03:03:15,530
Okay, now where the...

4338
03:03:15,530 --> 03:03:16,230
Do I go down here?

4339
03:03:16,570 --> 03:03:18,190
Where the fuck do I go after that?

4340
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:23,200
Oh shit.

4341
03:03:24,540 --> 03:03:25,360
I guess I'll go outside.

4342
03:03:25,880 --> 03:03:26,740
I feel safer.

4343
03:03:27,800 --> 03:03:28,100
Oh!

4344
03:03:30,780 --> 03:03:31,920
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

4345
03:03:35,320 --> 03:03:35,960
Okay.

4346
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:38,400
Here we go.

4347
03:03:39,880 --> 03:03:41,120
Alright, here we go.

4348
03:03:41,420 --> 03:03:42,160
Here we go.

4349
03:03:42,280 --> 03:03:42,580
Oh, hey.

4350
03:03:43,940 --> 03:03:44,620
Dog ahead.

4351
03:03:47,060 --> 03:03:48,340
Hey, why are you...

4352
03:03:48,340 --> 03:03:49,300
Oh shit!

4353
03:03:49,460 --> 03:03:50,420
You fight back?

4354
03:03:54,390 --> 03:03:55,390
Okay, nice.

4355
03:03:55,790 --> 03:03:56,310
Pre-loot.

4356
03:04:00,100 --> 03:04:01,680
First off, friend.

4357
03:04:02,340 --> 03:04:03,180
But item.

4358
03:04:05,860 --> 03:04:06,820
It's true, though.

4359
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:07,760
It's true.

4360
03:04:08,740 --> 03:04:09,720
He has item.

4361
03:04:09,940 --> 03:04:10,620
It's friend-shaped.

4362
03:04:10,800 --> 03:04:11,340
But item.

4363
03:04:14,260 --> 03:04:15,120
Again, head.

4364
03:04:18,280 --> 03:04:19,620
You wary of, right?

4365
03:04:19,900 --> 03:04:20,920
Oh, that's the crab.

4366
03:04:24,580 --> 03:04:25,060
Item.

4367
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:27,760
What the fuck?

4368
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:31,800
It's fucking right.

4369
03:04:32,140 --> 03:04:32,860
Oh my!

4370
03:04:32,980 --> 03:04:33,520
Okay, that's it.

4371
03:04:33,640 --> 03:04:33,900
That's it.

4372
03:04:33,960 --> 03:04:34,540
I'm taking you outside.

4373
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:37,080
I'm taking you outside.

4374
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:38,980
Your friend can't help you now.

4375
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:46,120
Alright.

4376
03:04:47,880 --> 03:04:50,260
Let's make sure we kill everything around here.

4377
03:04:51,580 --> 03:04:52,360
Oh, nice.

4378
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:53,100
I got crystal.

4379
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:56,500
Oh my god.

4380
03:04:56,620 --> 03:04:58,620
Did I actually have to go to that guy?

4381
03:05:00,500 --> 03:05:01,540
Get out of here.

4382
03:05:06,010 --> 03:05:07,130
Get out of here.

4383
03:05:09,490 --> 03:05:10,410
What is it, ladder?

4384
03:05:12,630 --> 03:05:13,770
I don't think I saw that.

4385
03:05:13,950 --> 03:05:14,490
Oh, there it is.

4386
03:05:14,610 --> 03:05:15,130
Oh, I see it.

4387
03:05:19,160 --> 03:05:19,520
Alright.

4388
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:20,220
Kick ladder.

4389
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:21,240
Whoa!

4390
03:05:22,840 --> 03:05:23,400
There we go.

4391
03:05:26,180 --> 03:05:26,540
Okay.

4392
03:05:27,340 --> 03:05:29,480
Do I actually have to fucking kill that guy?

4393
03:05:32,620 --> 03:05:33,880
There's a crossbow guy?

4394
03:05:33,880 --> 03:05:35,020
Where the fuck is he?

4395
03:05:43,410 --> 03:05:45,190
If you want to, I don't.

4396
03:05:45,310 --> 03:05:46,930
He like, he like fucked me up.

4397
03:05:51,010 --> 03:05:52,550
I don't, guys.

4398
03:05:53,070 --> 03:05:55,490
He really fucked me up, guys.

4399
03:06:04,520 --> 03:06:06,260
He was really scary.

4400
03:06:08,380 --> 03:06:09,720
Wait, then where do I go?

4401
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:13,340
Wait, I...

4402
03:06:13,340 --> 03:06:14,020
What the fuck?

4403
03:06:14,080 --> 03:06:15,080
They clapped the stairs?

4404
03:06:15,480 --> 03:06:16,560
I didn't get up here!

4405
03:06:17,060 --> 03:06:17,300
Ah!

4406
03:06:17,560 --> 03:06:18,940
They both of them get up here!

4407
03:06:23,070 --> 03:06:23,970
Excuse me?

4408
03:06:29,550 --> 03:06:30,450
Oh my god.

4409
03:06:30,470 --> 03:06:31,070
I hate you.

4410
03:06:33,770 --> 03:06:34,810
They can collapse!

4411
03:06:35,030 --> 03:06:36,130
Who gave them thumbs?

4412
03:06:37,650 --> 03:06:39,770
I won't have that.

4413
03:06:43,590 --> 03:06:44,490
Anything here?

4414
03:06:46,110 --> 03:06:46,570
No.

4415
03:06:47,830 --> 03:06:49,790
I'm like, eternally lost.

4416
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:00,480
They're like...

4417
03:07:00,480 --> 03:07:01,600
Beware of ambush.

4418
03:07:01,820 --> 03:07:02,660
Ladder, ladder.

4419
03:07:07,700 --> 03:07:08,880
That crossbow guy?

4420
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:09,500
That guy?

4421
03:07:09,500 --> 03:07:09,500
Why?

4422
03:07:12,340 --> 03:07:13,120
Him?

4423
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:15,980
Boys, you're gonna fuck me up!

4424
03:07:23,690 --> 03:07:24,450
Beat him.

4425
03:07:26,470 --> 03:07:27,250
Okay.

4426
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:33,440
He's alone now.

4427
03:07:36,220 --> 03:07:38,620
Kadoki, it's just one guy.

4428
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:40,540
Okay, you're right.

4429
03:07:41,460 --> 03:07:42,760
You're so right.

4430
03:07:43,040 --> 03:07:44,260
You're so right.

4431
03:07:44,800 --> 03:07:45,880
You're so right!

4432
03:07:46,680 --> 03:07:47,820
Oh, I bleed him!

4433
03:07:48,040 --> 03:07:48,940
That's right!

4434
03:07:48,940 --> 03:07:49,060
Fight!

4435
03:07:49,180 --> 03:07:49,940
I'm a boss!

4436
03:07:50,120 --> 03:07:50,340
Fight!

4437
03:07:51,700 --> 03:07:52,500
Oh, my god.

4438
03:07:52,740 --> 03:08:03,130
Oh, my g... Oh, just don't get shot.

4439
03:08:03,830 --> 03:08:05,490
Thank you for telling me that.

4440
03:08:08,210 --> 03:08:09,170
Thank you.

4441
03:08:09,550 --> 03:08:10,310
Hey, guys.

4442
03:08:10,630 --> 03:08:12,870
Guys, I really appreciate it.

4443
03:08:13,410 --> 03:08:14,030
Thank you.

4444
03:08:14,350 --> 03:08:15,070
Oh, man.

4445
03:08:16,510 --> 03:08:17,790
Thanks, guys.

4446
03:08:20,290 --> 03:08:23,250
I didn't know he could do that!

4447
03:08:23,710 --> 03:08:28,790
I... Where am I in this area?

4448
03:08:28,990 --> 03:08:29,650
Oh, I'm here.

4449
03:08:29,830 --> 03:08:30,130
Okay.

4450
03:08:32,630 --> 03:08:34,110
Like, was it here?

4451
03:08:34,850 --> 03:08:37,090
Just don't get shot.

4452
03:08:44,630 --> 03:08:45,290
Alright.

4453
03:08:47,570 --> 03:08:48,830
I was here, right?

4454
03:08:49,030 --> 03:08:49,750
Yeah, it was.

4455
03:08:50,010 --> 03:08:52,990
And then... Okay, there's the ladder.

4456
03:08:53,450 --> 03:08:54,570
I'm going for the ladder.

4457
03:08:56,370 --> 03:08:57,770
I'm faster than this.

4458
03:08:58,490 --> 03:09:00,490
Oh, my... Oh, my... Oh,

4459
03:09:05,040 --> 03:09:05,500
my...

4460
03:09:05,500 --> 03:09:17,360
Oh, my... I wasn't... I wasn't... I wasn't... Oh, my god.

4461
03:09:17,560 --> 03:09:17,760
Please.

4462
03:09:18,020 --> 03:09:19,200
Please, I'm... Please.

4463
03:09:19,340 --> 03:09:19,800
Please.

4464
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:19,880
Please.

4465
03:09:20,540 --> 03:09:20,860
Please.

4466
03:09:21,280 --> 03:09:21,280
Please.

4467
03:09:21,720 --> 03:09:21,720
Please.

4468
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:23,680
Please.

4469
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:23,820
Please.

4470
03:09:28,090 --> 03:09:28,410
Please.

4471
03:09:30,610 --> 03:09:30,930

4574
03:09:47,810 --> 03:09:48,850
Please I don't know why.

4575
03:09:49,050 --> 03:09:53,990
I don't know why.

4576
03:10:02,320 --> 03:10:02,880
Okay.

03:10:16,490 --> 03:10:17,310
We got two.

4585
03:10:19,450 --> 03:10:21,150
Oh, hey, my zero souls.

4586
03:10:21,310 --> 03:10:21,690
Let's go.

4587
03:10:25,140 --> 03:10:27,340
I don't know why I thought I was faster.

4588
03:10:27,540 --> 03:10:28,800
I don't know, guys.

4589
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,200
I just had such high hopes.

4590
03:10:31,520 --> 03:10:34,460
I am not able to climb the ladder.

4591
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:36,780
Who's the nerd now?

4592
03:10:37,400 --> 03:10:38,780
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

4593
03:10:38,960 --> 03:10:39,340

Thank you.

4598
03:10:44,140 --> 03:10:44,560
Thank you.

4599
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:46,260
I'm faster than them.

4600
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:48,240
Brod, who was slower?

4601
03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:50,920
I don't know.

4602
03:10:51,300 --> 03:10:52,880
I just thought, I don't know.

4603
03:10:53,100 --> 03:10:53,340
Maybe.

4604
03:10:54,320 --> 03:10:56,580
Maybe I was for once.

4605
03:10:59,400 --> 03:10:59,960
Okay.

4606
03:11:00,100 --> 03:11:00,440
That's fine.

4607
03:11:06,240 --> 03:11:10,400
I just thought maybe luck was on my side.

4608
03:11:10,580 --> 03:11:11,580
Oh my god.

4609
03:11:11,880 --> 03:11:12,240
Oh my god.

4610
03:11:12,400 --> 03:11:12,480
Okay.

4611
03:11:12,700 --> 03:11:14,000
My range was not it.

4612
03:11:19,450 --> 03:11:20,390
Jesus Christ.

4613
03:11:20,650 --> 03:11:20,690
Okay.

4614
03:11:21,050 --> 03:11:21,530
That's fine.

4615
03:11:24,250 --> 03:11:24,710
Prospect.

4616
03:11:24,850 --> 03:11:26,030
Thank you for the super chat.

4617
03:11:26,330 --> 03:11:26,450
Thank you.

4618
03:11:26,670 --> 03:11:27,090
Thank you.

4619
03:11:27,090 --> 03:11:32,030
I like to pay to see Doki because I run back and try to explode.

4620
03:11:32,470 --> 03:11:32,470
Dang.

4621
03:11:33,830 --> 03:11:34,650
All right.

4622
03:11:35,390 --> 03:11:36,030
Okay.

4623
03:11:36,250 --> 03:11:38,670
Now, now that I know how it works.

4624
03:11:41,090 --> 03:11:42,510
Now that I know.

4625
03:11:43,150 --> 03:11:44,010
All right.

4626
03:11:45,410 --> 03:11:46,130
That's it.

4627
03:11:46,230 --> 03:11:46,590
Oh!

4628
03:11:49,170 --> 03:11:49,810
Okay.

4629
03:11:52,190 --> 03:11:52,830
Okay.

4630
03:11:53,610 --> 03:11:54,690
That's fucking right.

4631
03:11:55,190 --> 03:11:56,030
That's right.

4632
03:11:57,350 --> 03:11:58,210
That's right.

4633
03:11:59,030 --> 03:11:59,570
Oh!

4634
03:12:00,150 --> 03:12:01,350
Get dodged!

4635
03:12:07,240 --> 03:12:08,160
Oh shit!

4636
03:12:08,280 --> 03:12:08,600
That's fine.

4637
03:12:08,980 --> 03:12:10,240
Oh, that's wrecking blitz!

4638
03:12:10,800 --> 03:12:11,180
Yeah!

4639
03:12:11,640 --> 03:12:12,820
I figured it out.

4640
03:12:13,380 --> 03:12:14,720
Guys, I figured it out.

4641
03:12:14,940 --> 03:12:16,460
I actually figured it out.

4642
03:12:17,480 --> 03:12:18,260
All right.

4643
03:12:19,320 --> 03:12:20,340
Oh, wait.

4644
03:12:20,680 --> 03:12:21,320
Wait, that's it?

4645
03:12:21,900 --> 03:12:22,560
Wait.

4646
03:12:23,680 --> 03:12:24,340
Wait.

4647
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:25,320
I did this for no reason?

4648
03:12:26,160 --> 03:12:27,240
Wait a minute.

4649
03:12:27,940 --> 03:12:28,660
Guys!

4650
03:12:29,020 --> 03:12:31,060
You took me to a fucking detour!

4651
03:12:33,960 --> 03:12:36,020
Why did you take me to a...

4652
03:12:36,020 --> 03:12:37,620
Oh my god.

4653
03:12:42,140 --> 03:12:43,860
You got the staff?

4654
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:45,880
I'm not even a nerd!

4655
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:50,160
Oh my god.

4656
03:12:50,700 --> 03:12:52,560
I don't even use magic!

4657
03:12:52,560 --> 03:12:52,780
I don't even use magic!

4658
03:12:56,080 --> 03:12:58,680
The staff was the cult.

4659
03:13:00,100 --> 03:13:02,360
Oh, I can memorize sorcery?

4660
03:13:02,600 --> 03:13:03,760
You must have a staff.

4661
03:13:03,880 --> 03:13:04,340
Oh, wow.

4662
03:13:04,440 --> 03:13:04,980
I wish...

4663
03:13:04,980 --> 03:13:06,220
I wish that was helpful.

4664
03:13:07,480 --> 03:13:10,340
The shortest way is the detour.

4665
03:13:11,400 --> 03:13:12,360
The staff...

4666
03:13:12,360 --> 03:13:12,740
Wow!

4667
03:13:13,260 --> 03:13:14,740
I wish I was...

4668
03:13:14,740 --> 03:13:17,260
I wish I could use it!

4669
03:13:21,560 --> 03:13:25,360
Oh, now you can invest in arcane.

4670
03:13:25,740 --> 03:13:26,100
Okay.

4671
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:28,420
Where the fuck do I...

4672
03:13:28,420 --> 03:13:31,800
Okay, now for the real path.

4673
03:13:36,050 --> 03:13:37,310
The wolf room?

4674
03:13:38,470 --> 03:13:40,070
Is this the wolf room?

4675
03:13:40,270 --> 03:13:40,490
No.

4676
03:13:40,810 --> 03:13:42,230
This was not the wolf room.

4677
03:13:46,140 --> 03:13:49,420
Have I been going the wrong way this entire time?

4678
03:13:51,260 --> 03:13:54,040
Let's check every crevice and every corner.

4679
03:13:54,260 --> 03:13:55,460
Get good, right?

4680
03:13:55,740 --> 03:13:57,120
Thank you for the super chat.

4681
03:13:57,280 --> 03:13:57,940
Thank you, thank you.

4682
03:13:58,340 --> 03:13:58,780
Yes!

4683
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:02,040
You made me parkour for no reason!

4684
03:14:06,220 --> 03:14:06,980
Hey, buddy.

4685
03:14:07,440 --> 03:14:08,820
Thank you for the super chat.

4686
03:14:08,940 --> 03:14:09,780
Thank you, thank you.

4687
03:14:10,060 --> 03:14:11,560
At least you have a cool stick.

4688
03:14:11,560 --> 03:14:13,500
You got the staff.

4689
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:15,200
Head right!

4690
03:14:15,520 --> 03:14:17,040
I went left!

4691
03:14:17,940 --> 03:14:20,280
And it was right all...

4692
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:21,340
Oh my god.

4693
03:14:21,720 --> 03:14:24,560
I head left and it was right...

4694
03:14:24,560 --> 03:14:25,320
Oh my god.

4695
03:14:25,420 --> 03:14:27,500
Don't tell me I was supposed to go down here.

4696
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:28,320
I...

4697
03:14:29,700 --> 03:14:31,080
Oh my god.

4698
03:14:39,680 --> 03:14:42,360
I went all the way there.

4699
03:14:42,740 --> 03:14:43,920
Oh my god.

4700
03:14:45,180 --> 03:14:47,760
I think I wasn't paying attention.

4701
03:14:50,640 --> 03:14:52,120
Guys, I don't think...

4702
03:14:52,700 --> 03:14:53,000
Oh!

4703
03:14:54,220 --> 03:14:55,520
How did I live that?

4704
03:14:55,880 --> 03:14:56,720
Oh my god.

4705
03:14:56,840 --> 03:14:58,900
I accidentally healed because I was scared.

4706
03:14:58,900 --> 03:14:59,500
I...

4707
03:14:59,500 --> 03:14:59,750
I...

4708
03:15:01,740 --> 03:15:02,960
I faced her.

4709
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:06,340
Okay.

4710
03:15:09,320 --> 03:15:10,320
Try parrying.

4711
03:15:10,960 --> 03:15:11,520
Okay, guys.

4712
03:15:11,700 --> 03:15:12,580
We are now.

4713
03:15:13,300 --> 03:15:14,160
Let's go ahead.

4714
03:15:19,740 --> 03:15:20,560
Oh my god.

4715
03:15:20,640 --> 03:15:21,640
He's running at me, isn't he?

4716
03:15:21,800 --> 03:15:22,220
He's...

4717
03:15:22,220 --> 03:15:23,140
Oh my god!

4718
03:15:23,460 --> 03:15:23,900
I...

4719
03:15:25,960 --> 03:15:27,200
Oh my god!

4720
03:15:27,560 --> 03:15:28,060
Step in!

4721
03:15:28,060 --> 03:15:32,140
I saw him running at me in the fucking distance.

4722
03:15:34,620 --> 03:15:35,760
Oh my god.

4723
03:15:38,340 --> 03:15:39,500
Oh my god.

4724
03:15:39,660 --> 03:15:40,600
Oh my god.

4725
03:15:43,280 --> 03:15:44,520
Oh my god.

4726
03:15:44,520 --> 03:15:48,200
Oh my god.

4727
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:48,460
Oh my god.

4728
03:15:48,460 --> 03:15:49,100
Wait, he's me.

4729
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:53,880
Oh, I'm trying to...

4730
03:15:53,880 --> 03:15:55,040
He said jump attack!

4731
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:56,580
I'm trying to do the jump attack!

4732
03:16:00,920 --> 03:16:02,080
Holy fuck!

4733
03:16:05,260 --> 03:16:05,840
Goodbye.

4734
03:16:08,740 --> 03:16:09,320
Oh...

4735
03:16:09,320 --> 03:16:10,860
He doesn't let me...

4736
03:16:10,860 --> 03:16:11,640
He doesn't let me leave.

4737
03:16:11,880 --> 03:16:12,700
He doesn't let me be.

4738
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:13,740
He doesn't...

4739
03:16:13,740 --> 03:16:14,080
Ah!

4740
03:16:16,260 --> 03:16:16,840
Okay.

4741
03:16:25,750 --> 03:16:26,910
Fight back!

4742
03:16:27,770 --> 03:16:29,130
Oh my god!

4743
03:16:29,330 --> 03:16:29,750
I'm trying!

4744
03:16:30,870 --> 03:16:33,690
Please, I'm actually trying to fight back.

4745
03:16:33,930 --> 03:16:35,730
He's me, but he's so much cooler.

4746
03:16:36,530 --> 03:16:39,730
He's me, but he's so much cooler, guys.

4747
03:16:42,770 --> 03:16:45,430
He's also faster?!

4748
03:16:45,430 --> 03:16:46,930
Oh my god.

4749
03:16:54,560 --> 03:16:56,800
You can never beat him.

4750
03:16:57,720 --> 03:16:58,500
That's fair!

4751
03:16:58,680 --> 03:17:00,000
Why is he so much faster?!

4752
03:17:04,230 --> 03:17:06,170
Oh my god, he didn't parry that.

4753
03:17:06,470 --> 03:17:06,930
That's right.

4754
03:17:07,230 --> 03:17:09,150
That's right, you didn't parry that.

4755
03:17:09,910 --> 03:17:11,970
He can heal?!

4756
03:17:14,870 --> 03:17:15,510
Wait!

4757
03:17:15,930 --> 03:17:16,910
That's illegal!

4758
03:17:17,470 --> 03:17:18,430
Wait a minute!

4759
03:17:19,250 --> 03:17:21,430
And he uses magic!

4760
03:17:21,750 --> 03:17:22,590
Pick a struggle!

4761
03:17:32,930 --> 03:17:36,290
They're passing because they got...

4762
03:17:36,610 --> 03:17:43,050
The better that he has everything that's not...

4763
03:17:43,050 --> 03:17:46,210
He does everything that you don't do, Doki.

4764
03:17:47,250 --> 03:17:48,390
He's so cool!

4765
03:17:50,830 --> 03:17:55,750
And with that, you reached the same number of deaths as last stream, Doki.

4766
03:17:56,570 --> 03:17:57,050
Congrats!

4767
03:17:57,730 --> 03:17:59,650
Thank you with the super chat.

4768
03:17:59,830 --> 03:18:00,890
Thank you, thank you.

4769
03:18:01,190 --> 03:18:02,550
That's the part of Doki.

4770
03:18:02,790 --> 03:18:04,650
Thank you, Reed and Parry.

4771
03:18:05,030 --> 03:18:06,670
Thank you with the super chat, Alan.

4772
03:18:06,910 --> 03:18:07,970
Thank you, thank you.

4773
03:18:07,970 --> 03:18:11,320
Oh my god, who is he?!

4774
03:18:11,870 --> 03:18:14,990
I didn't know they made Doki burn too.

4775
03:18:15,350 --> 03:18:18,450
Why is he... Why is... Oh my god!

4776
03:18:18,930 --> 03:18:20,110
Oh my god!

4777
03:18:20,390 --> 03:18:22,190
I'm such a mess now!

4778
03:18:25,610 --> 03:18:27,010
He's that guy.

4779
03:18:27,510 --> 03:18:28,390
I can't...

4780
03:18:28,390 --> 03:18:29,930
He fucked me up, guys.

4781
03:18:34,760 --> 03:18:36,180
I'm so scared.

4782
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:40,540
He's so much better than me, and I'm so scared.

4783
03:18:44,540 --> 03:18:45,260
Hehehehe.

4784
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:49,020
Like, why is he so fast?!

4785
03:18:49,020 --> 03:18:49,660
No!

4786
03:18:50,240 --> 03:18:50,660
No!

4787
03:18:50,660 --> 03:18:51,040
AHHHHH!

4788
03:18:53,180 --> 03:18:54,380
AHHHHH!

4789
03:19:00,100 --> 03:19:02,840
Why are you so much...

4790
03:19:02,840 --> 03:19:04,580
Wait, he breathes!

4791
03:19:04,700 --> 03:19:08,720
Does Doki actually breathes?

4792
03:19:08,760 --> 03:19:10,100
Get parried.

4793
03:19:10,400 --> 03:19:12,540
You've got better...

4794
03:19:12,540 --> 03:19:14,600
Get fucking parried.

4795
03:19:15,740 --> 03:19:20,700
Oh my god, he's you if you know how to parry, Toki.

4796
03:19:22,900 --> 03:19:24,280
Oh my god.

4797
03:19:25,920 --> 03:19:30,040
I tried to jump attack, but he just fucks me up.

4798
03:19:32,620 --> 03:19:33,260
Okay.

4799
03:19:40,730 --> 03:19:42,390
I just gotta go this way.

4800
03:19:43,110 --> 03:19:46,250
Okay, I should make it before the rocket's summoned, right?

4801
03:19:48,170 --> 03:19:49,330
Okay, I got it.

4802
03:19:51,470 --> 03:19:52,230
Oh my god.

4803
03:19:55,370 --> 03:19:56,330
Oh, yeah.

4804
03:19:58,950 --> 03:19:59,970
Guys, I don't know.

4805
03:20:01,890 --> 03:20:03,310
Oh my god, not again.

4806
03:20:03,510 --> 03:20:04,190
Not again.

4807
03:20:11,370 --> 03:20:13,130
Guys, that's fucking...

4808
03:20:13,130 --> 03:20:13,630
Oh, no!

4809
03:20:13,890 --> 03:20:14,330
I'm bad!

4810
03:20:14,510 --> 03:20:15,130
I'm sorry, no!

4811
03:20:19,910 --> 03:20:20,550
Oh my god.

4812
03:20:20,550 --> 03:20:22,810
Is that the infamous Toko bird?

4813
03:20:23,070 --> 03:20:25,390
Fatty, thank you for the super chat.

4814
03:20:25,770 --> 03:20:26,090
Thank you.

4815
03:20:26,290 --> 03:20:26,870
Thank you.

4816
03:20:27,610 --> 03:20:29,450
I got too confident.

4817
03:20:29,730 --> 03:20:31,730
I got too confident.

4818
03:20:33,450 --> 03:20:34,810
Oh my god.

4819
03:20:36,530 --> 03:20:37,630
Oh my god.

4820
03:20:37,750 --> 03:20:38,750
Okay, I figured it out.

4821
03:20:41,050 --> 03:20:42,530
I figured it out, guys.

4822
03:20:42,690 --> 03:20:44,350
I can beat a Toko bird.

4823
03:20:44,350 --> 03:20:45,730
I can beat her.

4824
03:20:46,910 --> 03:20:49,310
She'll never be as good as the original.

4825
03:20:51,810 --> 03:20:53,330
I got this.

4826
03:20:54,390 --> 03:20:58,170
She can never be better than the original Toki bird.

4827
03:20:58,170 --> 03:20:58,330
Okay.

4828
03:21:00,170 --> 03:21:01,630
You figured out how to parry?

4829
03:21:01,850 --> 03:21:02,470
No.

4830
03:21:02,790 --> 03:21:03,990
Even better.

4831
03:21:08,140 --> 03:21:09,360
Alright, here we go.

4832
03:21:16,580 --> 03:21:17,160
Alright.

4833
03:21:20,790 --> 03:21:21,100
Okay.

4834
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:23,440
Oh, that's fucking right.

4835
03:21:24,580 --> 03:21:25,560
Oh fuck!

4836
03:21:25,820 --> 03:21:25,880
Oh fuck!

4837
03:21:26,740 --> 03:21:27,420
Oh my god.

4838
03:21:27,560 --> 03:21:28,300
He thought...

4839
03:21:28,300 --> 03:21:30,780
He thought I was gonna hit that, but I didn't!

4840
03:21:45,720 --> 03:21:46,710
Watch this.

4841
03:21:52,280 --> 03:21:53,850
Oh shit, he's doing...

4842
03:21:53,850 --> 03:21:54,950
He's copying me!

4843
03:21:57,110 --> 03:21:58,130
That's illegal!

4844
03:21:59,190 --> 03:21:59,850
Oh!

4845
03:21:59,850 --> 03:22:00,050
Oh!

4846
03:22:07,230 --> 03:22:08,830
Oh, and you're also gonna heal too?

4847
03:22:16,390 --> 03:22:17,350
You fucker!

4848
03:22:18,230 --> 03:22:19,510
Oh my god, that's strange.

4849
03:22:22,070 --> 03:22:23,030
You fucker!

4850
03:22:31,800 --> 03:22:32,280
Bro!

4851
03:22:33,660 --> 03:22:35,040
He's copying me!

4852
03:22:35,200 --> 03:22:35,960
He's actually fucking...

4853
03:22:36,380 --> 03:22:36,960
Oh my god.

4854
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:37,540
Oh my god.

4855
03:22:37,600 --> 03:22:38,620
I'm gonna kill him.

4856
03:22:39,100 --> 03:22:39,560
I...

4857
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:40,860
He ran you like...

4858
03:22:40,860 --> 03:22:42,680
He got anti-aired now.

4859
03:22:42,880 --> 03:22:45,140
He fucking anti-aired me!

4860
03:22:45,580 --> 03:22:46,580
That whore!

4861
03:22:49,720 --> 03:22:50,200
Oh!

4862
03:22:50,360 --> 03:22:52,220
When he has the staff, he can't parry?

4863
03:22:52,340 --> 03:22:53,340
Okay, I didn't know that.

4864
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:54,840
Okay, now that I know.

4865
03:22:56,160 --> 03:22:57,920
Magic seems pretty cool now, does it?

4866
03:22:58,040 --> 03:22:58,280
No!

4867
03:22:58,780 --> 03:23:00,280
You can't convince me!

4868
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:05,900
I just need more gains!

4869
03:23:06,280 --> 03:23:07,000
That's it!

4870
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:09,740
That's it, guys!

4871
03:23:10,900 --> 03:23:12,460
I'm just lacking more...

4872
03:23:12,460 --> 03:23:13,520
I just need more gains!

4873
03:23:13,720 --> 03:23:15,020
And then I can beat up this nerd.

4874
03:23:18,810 --> 03:23:21,290
No, they can never be better than the original...

4875
03:23:26,030 --> 03:23:26,510
Okay.

4876
03:23:29,450 --> 03:23:30,030
Here we go.

4877
03:23:31,490 --> 03:23:31,870
Here we go.

4878
03:23:31,990 --> 03:23:32,450
Oh my god!

4879
03:23:32,590 --> 03:23:33,130
He still hits me!

4880
03:23:34,490 --> 03:23:35,270
What the fuck?

4881
03:23:35,290 --> 03:23:36,230
How does he still hit me?

4882
03:23:37,590 --> 03:23:38,490
Oh my god!

4883
03:23:38,670 --> 03:23:39,890
I'm trying to jump!

4884
03:23:44,550 --> 03:23:44,950
Okay,

4885
03:23:48,150 --> 03:23:48,550
nice.

4886
03:23:50,690 --> 03:23:51,090
Nice.

4887
03:23:51,290 --> 03:23:51,410
Okay.

4888
03:23:52,930 --> 03:23:53,650
What?

4889
03:23:57,750 --> 03:23:58,650
Oh my god!

4890
03:23:58,830 --> 03:23:59,390
The range!

4891
03:24:03,260 --> 03:24:03,980
Yeah.

4892
03:24:05,980 --> 03:24:06,700
Yes!

4893
03:24:06,960 --> 03:24:07,880
That's right!

4894
03:24:08,340 --> 03:24:09,420
My turn!

4895
03:24:11,360 --> 03:24:12,920
That's fucking right!

4896
03:24:13,240 --> 03:24:14,520
It's my turn!

4897
03:24:14,880 --> 03:24:15,280
Bitch!

4898
03:24:15,500 --> 03:24:16,380
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

4899
03:24:21,590 --> 03:24:22,310
Fucker.

4900
03:24:25,550 --> 03:24:27,730
Oh my god, you're such a fucker.

4901
03:24:27,730 --> 03:24:28,310
You're such a whore.

4902
03:24:28,410 --> 03:24:29,550
You're actually such a whore.

4903
03:24:30,030 --> 03:24:31,890
He's just slowly walking up to me.

4904
03:24:35,330 --> 03:24:35,930
Okay.

4905
03:24:36,250 --> 03:24:38,030
I'm not doing so well.

4906
03:24:42,550 --> 03:24:42,850
Okay.

4907
03:24:45,350 --> 03:24:45,950
Nice.

4908
03:24:52,370 --> 03:24:52,970
Stop!

4909
03:24:57,570 --> 03:24:59,490
You're such a bitch!

4910
03:24:59,830 --> 03:25:00,490
Don't go burn!

4911
03:25:02,390 --> 03:25:03,850
Oh my god.

4912
03:25:04,230 --> 03:25:05,690
You're actually such a bitch.

4913
03:25:06,830 --> 03:25:08,210
You're such a bitch!

4914
03:25:08,350 --> 03:25:09,530
I let you heal!

4915
03:25:10,190 --> 03:25:11,230
I let you heal!

4916
03:25:19,080 --> 03:25:20,500
That's fucking right!

4917
03:25:20,860 --> 03:25:22,780
You're never better than the original!

4918
03:25:23,360 --> 03:25:25,080
You'll never be better than me!

4919
03:25:25,280 --> 03:25:26,540
You're just a copy!

4920
03:25:26,900 --> 03:25:28,280
That's fucking right!

4921
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:30,120
That's right!

4922
03:25:30,580 --> 03:25:35,540
You're just a copy of an- You're an inferior version of the original.

4923
03:25:37,460 --> 03:25:38,980
Oh my god!

4924
03:25:39,760 --> 03:25:41,060
Love your time!

4925
03:25:41,720 --> 03:25:42,940
Love your time!

4926
03:25:43,960 --> 03:25:45,220
Love your time!

4927
03:25:47,720 --> 03:25:49,440
Oh, where am I?

4928
03:25:50,020 --> 03:25:51,440
Where the fuck am I?

4929
03:25:54,780 --> 03:25:55,800
Weak flow.

4930
03:25:56,200 --> 03:25:57,200
And then strong flow.

4931
03:25:57,400 --> 03:25:58,880
Didn't expect strong flow.

4932
03:26:02,280 --> 03:26:03,460
Oh, there was a shortcut?

4933
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:04,020
Okay.

4934
03:26:04,280 --> 03:26:04,900
Let me go back.

4935
03:26:10,550 --> 03:26:11,270
Bro, god.

4936
03:26:11,410 --> 03:26:11,810
That's right!

4937
03:26:12,050 --> 03:26:12,910
I DMCA'd him!

4938
03:26:13,950 --> 03:26:15,130
That's fucking right!

4939
03:26:15,370 --> 03:26:16,270
And I'll do it again!

4940
03:26:17,150 --> 03:26:18,730
Three strikes and you're out!

4941
03:26:25,900 --> 03:26:26,200
Alright.

4942
03:26:27,740 --> 03:26:29,200
Sorry I had to blow my nose.

4943
03:26:29,680 --> 03:26:32,120
Got too lazy to mute myself after that.

4944
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:36,860
Apparently there's- Is there like- Shortcut here?

4945
03:26:37,380 --> 03:26:38,320
Is it here?

4946
03:26:39,280 --> 03:26:40,460
Oh my god.

4947
03:26:48,980 --> 03:26:50,120
Oh my god!

4948
03:26:50,280 --> 03:26:52,140
That's so- Oh my god!

4949
03:26:52,140 --> 03:26:54,520
He hit me back the staircase.

4950
03:26:57,890 --> 03:26:59,280
Let's get rid of these guys first.

4951
03:27:03,420 --> 03:27:04,120
Wait.

4952
03:27:04,260 --> 03:27:04,580
Ahead?

4953
03:27:08,240 --> 03:27:10,380
That Goko Brint would mute.

4954
03:27:16,420 --> 03:27:17,120
Wait.

4955
03:27:17,320 --> 03:27:18,200
Where's the shortcut?

4956
03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:19,380
Is it up top?

4957
03:27:21,760 --> 03:27:23,840
You're left by the ball?

4958
03:27:24,020 --> 03:27:24,400
Yeah?

4959
03:27:29,450 --> 03:27:29,970
Oh.

4960
03:27:30,230 --> 03:27:30,830
Jump the ledge.

4961
03:27:31,010 --> 03:27:31,150
Okay.

4962
03:27:36,590 --> 03:27:37,110
No.

4963
03:27:37,250 --> 03:27:37,690
Go straight?

4964
03:27:37,950 --> 03:27:38,210
Oh.

4965
03:27:38,470 --> 03:27:38,630
Okay.

4966
03:27:40,130 --> 03:27:41,310
I'm so confused.

4967
03:27:45,470 --> 03:27:48,870
I feel like- One chat's telling the lie.

4968
03:27:49,030 --> 03:27:50,270
The other is telling the truth.

4969
03:27:50,470 --> 03:27:51,010
Oh there it is.

4970
03:27:51,110 --> 03:27:51,470
Nevermind.

4971
03:27:51,630 --> 03:27:52,070
Trick cut!

4972
03:27:53,030 --> 03:27:53,810
What's him?

4973
03:27:54,070 --> 03:27:55,090
It's this area.

4974
03:27:55,270 --> 03:27:56,790
It's that fucking door.

4975
03:27:57,350 --> 03:27:57,590
It's-

4976
03:28:01,410 --> 03:28:03,030
It's that fucking area.

4977
03:28:05,580 --> 03:28:06,030
Okay.

4978
03:28:06,150 --> 03:28:06,770
What's here then?

4979
03:28:10,980 --> 03:28:12,600
You wary of fruit?

4980
03:28:23,170 --> 03:28:24,070
Oh.

4981
03:28:26,890 --> 03:28:27,790
One...

4982
03:28:30,670 --> 03:28:31,570
Two...

4983
03:28:31,570 --> 03:28:31,910
Alright.

4984
03:28:32,530 --> 03:28:33,890
That's more than enough.

4985
03:28:35,070 --> 03:28:36,130
Time to leave.

4986
03:28:36,130 --> 03:28:37,670
I mean...

4987
03:28:37,670 --> 03:28:38,030
You cute.

4988
03:28:39,490 --> 03:28:40,290
Yeah.

4989
03:28:40,850 --> 03:28:41,170
Sesame.

4990
03:28:44,590 --> 03:28:45,390
Yeah!

4991
03:28:48,130 --> 03:28:49,430
So it is here.

4992
03:28:49,890 --> 03:28:50,510
Oh.

4993
03:28:51,230 --> 03:28:52,430
How is that shortcut?

4994
03:28:52,590 --> 03:28:53,130
Wait, what's this?

4995
03:28:58,330 --> 03:28:59,770
First off, done.

4996
03:29:01,550 --> 03:29:02,050
Okay.

4997
03:29:02,050 --> 03:29:02,070
Okay?

4998
03:29:11,690 --> 03:29:12,450
Touch it?

4999
03:29:16,720 --> 03:29:17,220
Oh.

5000
03:29:18,100 --> 03:29:19,100
Don't touch it?

5001
03:29:19,500 --> 03:29:20,880
I won't touch it.

5002
03:29:22,240 --> 03:29:23,520
Why should I level first?

5003
03:29:23,760 --> 03:29:25,620
Where the fuck is my level up area?

5004
03:29:27,480 --> 03:29:29,380
Is there like a grace anywhere?

5005
03:29:31,900 --> 03:29:35,160
I don't even know where- Oh my god, there has to be a grace somewhere.

5006
03:29:42,520 --> 03:29:44,040
I have to go back?

5007
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:47,100
Are you- Okay.

5008
03:29:47,860 --> 03:29:49,020
No, it should be fine.

5009
03:29:49,240 --> 03:29:50,140
I should be fine.

5010
03:29:50,320 --> 03:29:51,060
I got this.

5011
03:29:52,700 --> 03:29:53,700
I don't- Wait.

5012
03:29:53,960 --> 03:29:54,840
Where was that area?

5013
03:29:57,320 --> 03:29:58,120
Is it here?

5014
03:29:59,100 --> 03:30:00,240
Where was that part?

5015
03:30:00,380 --> 03:30:00,940
It was here.

5016
03:30:03,940 --> 03:30:04,380
Okay.

5017
03:30:04,380 --> 03:30:05,100
It's fine.

5018
03:30:08,280 --> 03:30:08,900
It's fine.

5019
03:30:09,040 --> 03:30:09,580
I'll level up.

5020
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:10,620
I think I have enough, right?

5021
03:30:13,460 --> 03:30:13,820
Okay.

5022
03:30:13,920 --> 03:30:15,380
Okay, the ball run was not that bad.

5023
03:30:15,740 --> 03:30:17,020
The ball- Oh wait, I don't have enough.

5024
03:30:17,140 --> 03:30:17,380
Fuck!

5025
03:30:17,700 --> 03:30:19,480
I don't have enough for the level up.

5026
03:30:20,700 --> 03:30:22,220
Okay, I need to- a thousand.

5027
03:30:22,320 --> 03:30:23,000
God damn it.

5028
03:30:23,060 --> 03:30:23,220
Okay.

5029
03:30:23,700 --> 03:30:24,680
But if I die here...

5030
03:30:25,400 --> 03:30:26,220
Okay, I got it.

5031
03:30:26,280 --> 03:30:27,000
I know what to do.

5032
03:30:28,580 --> 03:30:28,940
Okay.

5033
03:30:31,080 --> 03:30:32,560
I can kill some babies.

5034
03:30:33,680 --> 03:30:35,460
Oh my god, I have runes.

5035
03:30:35,560 --> 03:30:36,940
I forgot I carried so many.

5036
03:30:37,240 --> 03:30:38,480
I found so many runes.

5037
03:30:38,620 --> 03:30:39,900
I was just keeping collection.

5038
03:30:42,380 --> 03:30:44,200
Alright, where is my runes?

5039
03:30:47,780 --> 03:30:48,900
Oh, there it is.

5040
03:30:51,620 --> 03:30:52,780
Okay, that should be enough.

5041
03:30:53,820 --> 03:30:55,020
That's like 6k.

5042
03:30:56,440 --> 03:30:57,320
Okay, nice.

5043
03:30:57,760 --> 03:30:58,140
Alright.

5044
03:31:00,220 --> 03:31:01,060
Level up.

5045
03:31:01,060 --> 03:31:02,520
Okay, what do we level up, guys?

5046
03:31:06,520 --> 03:31:07,620
What do we level up?

5047
03:31:12,010 --> 03:31:13,350
HP or dexterity?

5048
03:31:14,310 --> 03:31:16,070
Vigor or dexterity, guys?

5049
03:31:16,450 --> 03:31:16,790
Vigor?

5050
03:31:17,110 --> 03:31:17,490
Okay.

5051
03:31:17,830 --> 03:31:18,830
We'll do dexterity next.

5052
03:31:20,590 --> 03:31:21,070
Alright.

5053
03:31:21,550 --> 03:31:23,050
Now it's time to run.

5054
03:31:32,540 --> 03:31:34,120
Okay, we're in the arcane soon.

5055
03:31:34,980 --> 03:31:35,460
Alright.

5056
03:31:35,920 --> 03:31:36,600
Don't worry.

5057
03:31:36,900 --> 03:31:37,900
First we go this way.

5058
03:31:38,560 --> 03:31:40,520
Oh wait, I should upgrade my weapon as well.

5059
03:31:40,520 --> 03:31:41,300
You're right.

5060
03:31:41,460 --> 03:31:43,040
I haven't upgraded my weapon in a while.

5061
03:31:47,720 --> 03:31:48,880
God, it's so far.

5062
03:31:49,540 --> 03:31:50,620
It's so far.

5063
03:31:54,680 --> 03:31:56,040
Alright, where is that guy?

5064
03:31:58,360 --> 03:32:01,640
Oh, legitimately when I first boot up this game, I thought I booted up Night Ring.

5065
03:32:01,820 --> 03:32:02,580
It's been that long.

5066
03:32:03,380 --> 03:32:04,620
I was just like...

5067
03:32:04,620 --> 03:32:05,580
I accidentally...

5068
03:32:05,580 --> 03:32:07,780
I accidentally played like Night Ring.

5069
03:32:09,200 --> 03:32:09,620
Alright.

5070
03:32:10,260 --> 03:32:11,320
Wait, I don't have enough money.

5071
03:32:11,400 --> 03:32:11,980
Oh wait, I do.

5072
03:32:11,980 --> 03:32:12,080
I do.

5073
03:32:12,120 --> 03:32:12,540
Okay.

5074
03:32:13,460 --> 03:32:14,360
I'm gonna...

5075
03:32:14,520 --> 03:32:16,020
Do another...

5076
03:32:18,860 --> 03:32:20,240
I'm gonna do another rune.

5077
03:32:23,810 --> 03:32:25,170
One rune!

5078
03:32:26,830 --> 03:32:27,390
Alright.

5079
03:32:29,570 --> 03:32:30,690
Okay.

5080
03:32:31,750 --> 03:32:32,610
So that...

5081
03:32:32,610 --> 03:32:33,750
I don't...

5082
03:32:34,510 --> 03:32:35,590
Ashes of what?

5083
03:32:38,730 --> 03:32:39,290
Okay.

5084
03:32:41,490 --> 03:32:42,790
Wait, I don't have enough?

5085
03:32:42,990 --> 03:32:43,510
What do I need?

5086
03:32:45,890 --> 03:32:46,450
Oh!

5087
03:32:49,800 --> 03:32:51,160
I need two more.

5088
03:32:51,880 --> 03:32:53,400
I have no stones.

5089
03:32:53,860 --> 03:32:54,420
It's okay.

5090
03:32:55,860 --> 03:32:56,980
I know...

5091
03:32:56,980 --> 03:32:57,580
I know a guy.

5092
03:32:58,580 --> 03:32:59,840
I know a guy.

5093
03:33:00,860 --> 03:33:01,860
Where was he?

5094
03:33:04,080 --> 03:33:04,900
Is it him?

5095
03:33:07,400 --> 03:33:08,760
What the fuck was that guy?

5096
03:33:13,910 --> 03:33:14,470
What the fuck was that guy?

5097
03:33:14,470 --> 03:33:15,350
Why should...

5098
03:33:15,850 --> 03:33:16,550
It's that guy!

5099
03:33:16,750 --> 03:33:18,170
That guy that was like...

5100
03:33:18,170 --> 03:33:18,810
The guy...

5101
03:33:18,810 --> 03:33:20,210
The guy that started kicking him.

5102
03:33:24,240 --> 03:33:24,760
Oh.

5103
03:33:25,220 --> 03:33:25,640
Oh.

5104
03:33:25,640 --> 03:33:26,620
The girl you brought here.

5105
03:33:27,520 --> 03:33:30,780
She's crestfallen and can scarcely swing a blade.

5106
03:33:31,300 --> 03:33:32,860
But she has a gift.

5107
03:33:33,200 --> 03:33:34,640
For spirit tuning.

5108
03:33:35,820 --> 03:33:36,520
Oh, at the lake!

5109
03:33:36,620 --> 03:33:37,320
Yeah, I know him!

5110
03:33:37,900 --> 03:33:39,040
I know that guy!

5111
03:33:39,560 --> 03:33:40,360
The church!

5112
03:33:40,580 --> 03:33:41,220
There are many guys!

5113
03:33:41,360 --> 03:33:41,780
That's right!

5114
03:33:42,300 --> 03:33:43,660
I know many guys!

5115
03:33:45,460 --> 03:33:45,940
I'm...

5116
03:33:47,400 --> 03:33:48,940
I'm a guy for everything!

5117
03:33:49,940 --> 03:33:50,380
Okay.

5118
03:33:50,860 --> 03:33:51,540
Is that guy?

5119
03:33:52,740 --> 03:33:53,920
No, that's not him.

5120
03:33:54,420 --> 03:33:55,580
Guys, there's so many guys.

5121
03:33:58,860 --> 03:33:59,700
Oh, it's him!

5122
03:33:59,940 --> 03:34:00,720
There you go, there you go.

5123
03:34:00,780 --> 03:34:01,500
See, I told you!

5124
03:34:02,020 --> 03:34:03,120
I know a guy!

5125
03:34:09,440 --> 03:34:10,380
There he is.

5126
03:34:12,860 --> 03:34:14,600
There's like three guys.

5127
03:34:16,560 --> 03:34:17,240
Not every...

5128
03:34:18,660 --> 03:34:19,960
Okay, which stone was it?

5129
03:34:20,040 --> 03:34:20,840
Was it a one or...

5130
03:34:20,840 --> 03:34:21,820
Oh my god, I didn't pick...

5131
03:34:21,820 --> 03:34:22,540
Oh, it was one!

5132
03:34:22,700 --> 03:34:23,860
It was one because I had only...

5133
03:34:23,860 --> 03:34:24,580
I only had...

5134
03:34:24,580 --> 03:34:24,940
Uh...

5135
03:34:24,940 --> 03:34:25,140
Two.

5136
03:34:25,600 --> 03:34:26,140
I only had four.

5137
03:34:26,460 --> 03:34:27,140
Okay, there you go.

5138
03:34:30,970 --> 03:34:32,050
God, it's so far.

5139
03:34:37,750 --> 03:34:38,090
Alright.

5140
03:34:41,270 --> 03:34:42,450
Told you I knew a guy!

5141
03:34:43,510 --> 03:34:44,250
Told you chat!

5142
03:34:47,270 --> 03:34:49,050
Oh, Y and X instantly...

5143
03:34:49,050 --> 03:34:49,210
Oh!

5144
03:34:49,470 --> 03:34:50,150
Okay, that's gonna be...

5145
03:34:50,150 --> 03:34:50,990
That's nice to know.

5146
03:34:54,670 --> 03:34:55,150
Okay.

5147
03:34:56,630 --> 03:34:57,390
Here we go.

5148
03:34:58,030 --> 03:34:59,570
And then I need...

5149
03:35:01,070 --> 03:35:01,550
Four...

5150
03:35:01,550 --> 03:35:03,290
Okay, I need smithing stone too.

5151
03:35:03,670 --> 03:35:04,290
Don't worry!

5152
03:35:05,070 --> 03:35:06,250
I know a guy!

5153
03:35:08,850 --> 03:35:10,370
Oh wait, I can zoom out!

5154
03:35:13,470 --> 03:35:15,350
I still know so many!

5155
03:35:18,640 --> 03:35:19,240
Okay.

5156
03:35:24,010 --> 03:35:25,490
Alright, let me...

5157
03:35:25,490 --> 03:35:27,570
Okay, I was definitely incredibly underleveled.

5158
03:35:27,890 --> 03:35:29,470
I realized...

5159
03:35:30,210 --> 03:35:32,590
I realized when I was upgrading my weapon...

5160
03:35:32,990 --> 03:35:35,750
That may or may not have been incredibly...

5161
03:35:35,750 --> 03:35:36,170
Oh wait!

5162
03:35:37,610 --> 03:35:40,710
May or may not have been incredibly underleveled.

5163
03:35:43,270 --> 03:35:44,610
No, I need more stones!

5164
03:35:44,850 --> 03:35:45,330
I had...

5165
03:35:45,330 --> 03:35:46,490
I ran out of stones!

5166
03:35:48,210 --> 03:35:49,910
I ran out of these stones!

5167
03:35:50,630 --> 03:35:51,230
Oh wait!

5168
03:35:51,330 --> 03:35:51,870
No, I have enough!

5169
03:35:52,110 --> 03:35:52,470
Wait, no!

5170
03:35:52,790 --> 03:35:53,230
JK!

5171
03:35:53,650 --> 03:35:54,690
I don't need you!

5172
03:35:58,450 --> 03:35:59,410
I thought...

5173
03:35:59,410 --> 03:36:00,730
I thought it needed...

5174
03:36:00,730 --> 03:36:01,790
I needed 14...

5175
03:36:01,790 --> 03:36:03,330
I thought I had four, but...

5176
03:36:03,330 --> 03:36:03,570
I...

5177
03:36:03,570 --> 03:36:04,630
It was the opposite.

5178
03:36:06,970 --> 03:36:08,310
I'll need you no more.

5179
03:36:08,310 --> 03:36:08,450
Alright.

5180
03:36:09,630 --> 03:36:11,170
The guy I knew was actually you!

5181
03:36:11,350 --> 03:36:12,090
Sorry about that!

5182
03:36:12,510 --> 03:36:12,950
Hahaha!

5183
03:36:18,490 --> 03:36:19,270
Oh my god!

5184
03:36:19,850 --> 03:36:20,390
Okay, wait.

5185
03:36:22,370 --> 03:36:23,930
Okay, I need smithing stone 3.

5186
03:36:24,050 --> 03:36:24,610
Okay, I don't...

5187
03:36:24,610 --> 03:36:25,710
I don't know a guy for that.

5188
03:36:25,910 --> 03:36:27,690
Okay, now...

5189
03:36:28,350 --> 03:36:29,010
Which girl?

5190
03:36:29,370 --> 03:36:30,310
Isn't there a woman?

5191
03:36:32,570 --> 03:36:33,270
Which one?

5192
03:36:34,370 --> 03:36:35,030
Oh, her?

5193
03:36:35,030 --> 03:36:35,410
Where?!

5194
03:36:36,090 --> 03:36:36,770
Grr?

5195
03:36:37,030 --> 03:36:38,170
My name is Rodaarica.

5196
03:36:39,410 --> 03:36:41,130
I should've told you sooner.

5197
03:36:41,570 --> 03:36:44,110
Isn't this place impressive though?

5198
03:36:44,390 --> 03:36:47,050
The round table hold...

5199
03:36:47,050 --> 03:36:52,050
... Covert quarters of the two fingers, ...and gathering place of champions...

5200
03:36:52,050 --> 03:36:53,790
...who vied to become Elder Lord.

5201
03:36:54,130 --> 03:36:57,590
I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us tarnished.

5202
03:36:57,790 --> 03:36:59,850
Had such fantastic roots.

5203
03:37:00,550 --> 03:37:01,230
Although...

5204
03:37:01,230 --> 03:37:04,190
It's all a bit much for me, in truth.

5205
03:37:04,750 --> 03:37:06,310
Oh, she can treat my jellyfish?

5206
03:37:08,410 --> 03:37:08,970
Okay.

5207
03:37:09,950 --> 03:37:13,170
You're telling me I possess some kind of gift.

5208
03:37:13,230 --> 03:37:15,910
Oh my god, my jellyfish was also underleveled.

5209
03:37:16,330 --> 03:37:25,870
But if I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first, I suppose I should try to hone it, shouldn't I?

5210
03:37:25,870 --> 03:37:28,670
I'll ask Master Hugh to teach me.

5211
03:37:29,190 --> 03:37:34,330
Certainly he does appear intimidating and holds no love for us tarnished.

5212
03:37:35,050 --> 03:37:37,990
Yeah, my jellyfish was literally at level zero.

5213
03:37:39,170 --> 03:37:41,190
I don't know how I got this far.

5214
03:37:41,370 --> 03:37:42,370
Oh, I know how.

5215
03:37:43,390 --> 03:37:46,470
With the power of a thousand drag wounds.

5216
03:37:46,850 --> 03:37:49,650
I suppose I should try to hone it, shouldn't I?

5217
03:37:50,190 --> 03:37:52,450
I'll ask Master Hugh to teach me.

5218
03:37:53,590 --> 03:37:54,210
Wait, what?

5219
03:37:54,530 --> 03:37:55,450
Who's Master Hugh?

5220
03:38:01,540 --> 03:38:02,480
Okay, you're not that.

5221
03:38:02,840 --> 03:38:05,900
You want to have a bear bear that lets you buy smithy stone from Roundtable?

5222
03:38:06,180 --> 03:38:07,880
No need to find your guy anymore?

5223
03:38:08,080 --> 03:38:09,380
Propsky, thank you to the super chat.

5224
03:38:09,500 --> 03:38:09,740
Thank you.

5225
03:38:10,700 --> 03:38:11,820
Oh, it's a blacksmith.

5226
03:38:12,060 --> 03:38:12,200
Okay.

5227
03:38:12,500 --> 03:38:13,780
Oh, it's a back and forth.

5228
03:38:17,520 --> 03:38:17,900
Okay.

5229
03:38:29,100 --> 03:38:31,660
Hey, you might have a wonderful personality.

5230
03:38:33,660 --> 03:38:35,640
It's about the end of beauty!

5231
03:38:35,640 --> 03:38:37,860
I refuse to believe it.

5232
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:42,540
I don't doubt you, but I know when something's too good to be true.

5233
03:38:44,240 --> 03:38:44,880
Alright.

5234
03:38:46,380 --> 03:38:46,920
Let's go.

5235
03:38:47,300 --> 03:38:48,680
Maybe she's blind.

5236
03:38:50,980 --> 03:38:54,220
If I do have a talent for spirit tuning.

5237
03:38:54,700 --> 03:38:57,100
And goodness knows that would be a surprise.

5238
03:38:57,620 --> 03:39:00,540
I suppose I should try to hone it, shouldn't I?

5239
03:39:00,820 --> 03:39:03,320
I'll ask Master Hugh to teach me.

5240
03:39:04,280 --> 03:39:05,040
Wait, what?

5241
03:39:06,320 --> 03:39:07,960
Wait, I already talked to him.

5242
03:39:09,700 --> 03:39:10,180
Oh!

5243
03:39:10,420 --> 03:39:11,420
I have to rest.

5244
03:39:11,840 --> 03:39:13,420
Pretend I didn't talk to you.

5245
03:39:13,960 --> 03:39:14,520
It's fine.

5246
03:39:16,340 --> 03:39:17,640
I'll just come back here.

5247
03:39:19,500 --> 03:39:19,980
Hello.

5248
03:39:21,160 --> 03:39:22,120
It's like I...

5249
03:39:22,120 --> 03:39:22,860
Oh, she's gone.

5250
03:39:23,040 --> 03:39:23,800
Wait, where did she go?

5251
03:39:26,080 --> 03:39:28,480
Oh, I actually have to wait an entire day?

5252
03:39:30,620 --> 03:39:32,080
Where the fuck did she go?

5253
03:39:39,820 --> 03:39:40,920
Oh, there she is.

5254
03:39:41,160 --> 03:39:42,720
Oh, she took off her hoods.

5255
03:39:43,380 --> 03:39:43,920
I couldn't tell.

5256
03:39:47,520 --> 03:39:49,840
Yeah, I like left the door and came back.

5257
03:39:50,260 --> 03:39:51,460
I walked out the door.

5258
03:39:56,240 --> 03:39:57,080
Oh, that fast?

5259
03:39:57,080 --> 03:39:59,220
I was out for like 10 seconds.

5260
03:39:59,220 --> 03:39:59,260
I was out for like 10 seconds.

5261
03:39:59,720 --> 03:40:01,140
What I might be able to accomplish.

5262
03:40:02,100 --> 03:40:06,720
But if I might be able to help you all, I'd certainly like to try.

5263
03:40:07,460 --> 03:40:11,300
And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men...

5264
03:40:11,300 --> 03:40:12,180
My first found her?

5265
03:40:12,340 --> 03:40:12,640
Who is...

5266
03:40:12,640 --> 03:40:13,140
I don't...

5267
03:40:13,140 --> 03:40:13,760
Who is she?

5268
03:40:14,840 --> 03:40:16,760
Guys, I met so many maidens.

5269
03:40:16,860 --> 03:40:18,640
I don't even remember when I met her.

5270
03:40:18,940 --> 03:40:20,700
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

5271
03:40:22,180 --> 03:40:22,800
Okay.

5272
03:40:23,140 --> 03:40:23,820
Spear tuning.

5273
03:40:24,960 --> 03:40:25,580
Okay.

5274
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:29,060
I need the grave glove wart.

5275
03:40:29,320 --> 03:40:30,220
The fuck is that?

5276
03:40:31,140 --> 03:40:32,360
Guys, do I know a guy?

5277
03:40:34,780 --> 03:40:36,140
Wait, when did she...

5278
03:40:36,140 --> 03:40:37,360
She gave me that?

5279
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:39,400
I didn't fucking adopt it?

5280
03:40:41,020 --> 03:40:43,540
Yeah, but what's the grave glove wart?

5281
03:40:43,540 --> 03:40:44,700
It's a flower.

5282
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:45,140
It's a flower.

5283
03:40:45,140 --> 03:40:45,220
Oh.

5284
03:40:47,980 --> 03:40:48,820
Oh, okay.

5285
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:50,220
Where the fuck is that flower?

5286
03:40:53,760 --> 03:40:55,100
Do I know a guy?

5287
03:40:58,560 --> 03:41:00,140
I explored those dungeons.

5288
03:41:00,340 --> 03:41:01,620
Where the fuck is that?

5289
03:41:04,680 --> 03:41:05,200
Catacombs?

5290
03:41:05,320 --> 03:41:06,860
I was in the catacombs?

5291
03:41:13,890 --> 03:41:15,070
There's a graveyard.

5292
03:41:16,450 --> 03:41:18,210
Oh, I didn't do a dungeon.

5293
03:41:18,550 --> 03:41:18,950
I...

5294
03:41:22,850 --> 03:41:23,450
Okay.

5295
03:41:23,950 --> 03:41:25,370
Here, there's a church here.

5296
03:41:25,550 --> 03:41:27,110
Maybe we'll find a dungeon here.

5297
03:41:30,280 --> 03:41:31,800
I skipped all of them.

5298
03:41:32,020 --> 03:41:32,520
That's fine.

5299
03:41:33,240 --> 03:41:34,100
Oh yeah, there's Santa.

5300
03:41:34,980 --> 03:41:35,580
Alright.

5301
03:41:35,960 --> 03:41:37,200
Let's find this dungeon.

5302
03:41:37,700 --> 03:41:39,320
Apparently, there's one here somewhere.

5303
03:41:42,780 --> 03:41:43,980
Is that a dungeon?

5304
03:41:45,080 --> 03:41:46,180
That's a building.

5305
03:41:51,320 --> 03:41:52,760
There's one north of the church.

5306
03:41:52,940 --> 03:41:53,400
Okay, north.

5307
03:41:53,540 --> 03:41:54,080
That's this way.

5308
03:41:56,120 --> 03:41:57,440
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

5309
03:41:57,540 --> 03:41:58,200
Thank you, thank you.

5310
03:41:58,240 --> 03:41:59,460
You skipped every...

5311
03:42:00,360 --> 03:42:01,080
How the fuck?

5312
03:42:01,200 --> 03:42:01,600
It's like...

5313
03:42:01,600 --> 03:42:02,900
It's like when I played Minecraft.

5314
03:42:03,160 --> 03:42:03,600
And we...

5315
03:42:04,280 --> 03:42:04,600
We...

5316
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:05,320
Somehow...

5317
03:42:05,320 --> 03:42:07,760
Went past every fucking...

5318
03:42:09,940 --> 03:42:11,360
There was a castle there.

5319
03:42:17,700 --> 03:42:18,620
Look for the reaper.

5320
03:42:18,780 --> 03:42:19,400
Oh, there's a cat.

5321
03:42:19,480 --> 03:42:20,200
Oh, there it is.

5322
03:42:20,360 --> 03:42:21,400
Over here, I see it.

5323
03:42:22,380 --> 03:42:24,500
Yeah, every nether fortress.

5324
03:42:28,690 --> 03:42:29,570
Okay.

5325
03:42:29,890 --> 03:42:30,610
I'm too lazy.

5326
03:42:32,430 --> 03:42:33,270
It's right here.

5327
03:42:33,710 --> 03:42:34,970
That's a dungeon, right?

5328
03:42:44,620 --> 03:42:45,500
What?

5329
03:42:48,340 --> 03:42:48,780
Oh!

5330
03:42:49,580 --> 03:42:50,660
I'll live.

5331
03:42:52,380 --> 03:42:52,920
Okay.

5332
03:42:55,400 --> 03:42:56,220
It's this way.

5333
03:43:00,940 --> 03:43:02,340
You point it that way.

5334
03:43:05,920 --> 03:43:07,700
See, I told you I know a guy.

5335
03:43:10,180 --> 03:43:11,220
Oh, there it is.

5336
03:43:11,400 --> 03:43:12,160
I see it.

5337
03:43:16,250 --> 03:43:17,730
Alright, we gotta get the glove.

5338
03:43:20,830 --> 03:43:21,790
Alright, here I go.

5339
03:43:21,790 --> 03:43:21,910
Oh.

5340
03:43:24,630 --> 03:43:27,230
Maybe it's a baby dungeon because I haven't been in one yet.

5341
03:43:34,680 --> 03:43:35,120
Okay.

5342
03:43:35,320 --> 03:43:36,580
It might be a baby dungeon.

5343
03:43:40,380 --> 03:43:42,500
Proper death means returning to Earth Tree.

5344
03:43:42,800 --> 03:43:45,060
Have patience until the time comes.

5345
03:43:45,680 --> 03:43:46,480
And the root costs you.

5346
03:43:46,620 --> 03:43:46,860
Alright.

5347
03:43:47,040 --> 03:43:48,480
There's no way I could fuck this up.

5348
03:43:48,580 --> 03:43:49,420
It's a baby dungeon.

5349
03:43:50,520 --> 03:43:51,260
Oh!

5350
03:43:55,260 --> 03:43:56,000
Okay.

5351
03:43:56,220 --> 03:43:57,040
That was bullshit.

5352
03:43:57,260 --> 03:43:58,180
That was actually bullshit.

5353
03:43:58,460 --> 03:43:58,800
That...

5354
03:43:58,800 --> 03:44:01,040
That was...

5355
03:44:04,560 --> 03:44:05,300
Okay.

5356
03:44:05,780 --> 03:44:06,460
Okay.

5357
03:44:06,680 --> 03:44:06,880
Okay.

5358
03:44:06,880 --> 03:44:07,900
That was not fair.

5359
03:44:08,120 --> 03:44:09,400
That... that was not fair.

5360
03:44:11,100 --> 03:44:12,740
Oh, thank you.

5361
03:44:13,100 --> 03:44:14,040
Thank you.

5362
03:44:14,860 --> 03:44:16,720
Be wary of left.

5363
03:44:17,140 --> 03:44:17,960
Oh, man.

5364
03:44:19,020 --> 03:44:22,780
I wish... I wish I... I read that.

5365
03:44:23,900 --> 03:44:27,880
Of course, the one message I decided to not read.

5366
03:44:32,480 --> 03:44:33,200
Okay.

5367
03:44:35,580 --> 03:44:36,480
Oh, hey.

5368
03:44:36,820 --> 03:44:37,980
There's a guy over there.

5369
03:44:38,180 --> 03:44:38,800
Does he throw something?

5370
03:44:38,820 --> 03:44:39,020
Do these things?

5371
03:44:42,000 --> 03:44:42,400
Okay.

5372
03:44:42,500 --> 03:44:43,620
There's multiple guys here.

5373
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:45,400
Wait.

5374
03:44:45,580 --> 03:44:46,420
Is there more flowers?

5375
03:44:46,700 --> 03:44:48,760
Or, like, is that one flower I'm gonna find?

5376
03:44:53,150 --> 03:44:53,650
Come on.

5377
03:44:53,750 --> 03:44:54,810
I'll take you one by one.

5378
03:44:56,030 --> 03:44:56,430
Ow.

5379
03:44:56,710 --> 03:44:56,930
Okay.

5380
03:44:57,030 --> 03:44:57,410
Never mind.

5381
03:44:58,570 --> 03:44:59,470
Oh, there's more?

5382
03:44:59,650 --> 03:44:59,910
Okay.

5383
03:45:00,590 --> 03:45:01,270
Oh, what's this?

5384
03:45:04,850 --> 03:45:05,550
Summoning pool.

5385
03:45:09,880 --> 03:45:10,760
Oh, there's more?

5386
03:45:10,900 --> 03:45:11,060
Okay.

5387
03:45:11,120 --> 03:45:11,460
That's good.

5388
03:45:14,540 --> 03:45:16,660
Oh, it's like a little pig statue.

5389
03:45:16,960 --> 03:45:17,740
Look at this guy.

5390
03:45:20,300 --> 03:45:21,120
Oh, there's more.

5391
03:45:21,260 --> 03:45:21,360
Nice.

5392
03:45:21,540 --> 03:45:21,740
Oh, wait.

5393
03:45:21,860 --> 03:45:22,680
No, that's not what I wanted.

5394
03:45:23,980 --> 03:45:25,000
Oh, there is more.

5395
03:45:25,260 --> 03:45:25,900
Look at that.

5396
03:45:34,330 --> 03:45:34,770
Alright.

5397
03:45:34,770 --> 03:45:36,110
I'm just gonna heal up.

5398
03:45:36,170 --> 03:45:36,970
I don't trust myself.

5399
03:45:38,650 --> 03:45:39,770
Be wary of right.

5400
03:45:40,230 --> 03:45:42,030
What the fuck is that?

5401
03:45:42,030 --> 03:45:42,070
What the fuck is that?

5402
03:45:43,850 --> 03:45:45,390
No fucking shit.

5403
03:45:45,390 --> 03:45:46,310
I should be wary.

5404
03:45:47,210 --> 03:45:48,230
Are I throwing?

5405
03:45:48,970 --> 03:45:49,850
Throwing what?

5406
03:45:53,380 --> 03:45:54,860
What do I throw?

5407
03:45:57,220 --> 03:45:58,060
Wait.

5408
03:45:58,120 --> 03:45:58,740
I can craft.

5409
03:46:03,140 --> 03:46:04,780
I'm missing one.

5410
03:46:05,580 --> 03:46:06,100
I...

5411
03:46:10,020 --> 03:46:11,720
I'm missing one.

5412
03:46:17,220 --> 03:46:18,520
Okay, maybe, guys.

5413
03:46:18,840 --> 03:46:19,300
Oh, I have that.

5414
03:46:19,480 --> 03:46:19,980
Oh, thank god.

5415
03:46:20,200 --> 03:46:20,940
Oh, thank god.

5416
03:46:21,380 --> 03:46:21,500
Okay.

5417
03:46:22,100 --> 03:46:22,780
Thank god.

5418
03:46:23,080 --> 03:46:23,240
Okay.

5419
03:46:32,400 --> 03:46:32,940
Oh, my god.

5420
03:46:33,020 --> 03:46:33,600
How do I do this?

5421
03:46:33,760 --> 03:46:34,100
Okay, here.

5422
03:46:37,080 --> 03:46:37,740
Oh, my god.

5423
03:46:37,900 --> 03:46:38,400
Where is the...

5424
03:46:41,580 --> 03:46:43,100
Where the fuck is the...

5425
03:46:43,100 --> 03:46:44,300
Where the fuck... Okay.

5426
03:46:45,240 --> 03:46:46,380
Guys, I'm trying to figure out...

5427
03:46:48,540 --> 03:46:49,580
I don't have...

5428
03:46:49,580 --> 03:46:50,260
I don't have...

5429
03:46:50,260 --> 03:46:51,260
I don't have arrows.

5430
03:46:55,480 --> 03:46:57,220
I think I don't have arrows.

5431
03:47:01,010 --> 03:47:01,970
Lower row?

5432
03:47:04,750 --> 03:47:05,330
Wait.

5433
03:47:05,410 --> 03:47:06,460
How do I get to my...

5434
03:47:08,250 --> 03:47:08,830
Oh.

5435
03:47:10,370 --> 03:47:10,810
The fuck?

5436
03:47:10,850 --> 03:47:12,630
How do I use my daggers?

5437
03:47:16,110 --> 03:47:17,430
How do I...

5438
03:47:18,450 --> 03:47:19,230
That's it.

5439
03:47:20,550 --> 03:47:21,210
That's it.

5440
03:47:23,250 --> 03:47:24,170
Did it hit?

5441
03:47:24,890 --> 03:47:26,330
Guys, I don't think it hit.

5442
03:47:27,610 --> 03:47:28,170
I...

5443
03:47:28,170 --> 03:47:30,430
I don't think...

5444
03:47:33,150 --> 03:47:35,890
I don't think I hit it, guys.

5445
03:47:36,190 --> 03:47:36,910
Oh, okay.

5446
03:47:36,950 --> 03:47:37,390
There we go.

5447
03:48:00,160 --> 03:48:01,800
I'm just gonna run.

5448
03:48:10,620 --> 03:48:13,300
I'm just gonna run.

5449
03:48:13,540 --> 03:48:14,860
There's no point.

5450
03:48:15,420 --> 03:48:17,520
There actually...

5451
03:48:17,520 --> 03:48:19,320
There's no point.

5452
03:48:19,540 --> 03:48:21,680
I don't know why I even tried.

5453
03:48:22,400 --> 03:48:22,660
I...

5454
03:48:22,660 --> 03:48:23,920
I don't know why.

5455
03:48:25,220 --> 03:48:26,920
I don't know why.

5456
03:48:27,240 --> 03:48:27,520
I don't know why.

5457
03:48:31,730 --> 03:48:32,330
I don't know why.

5458
03:48:32,330 --> 03:48:32,670
Fuck, I hit it?

5459
03:48:32,770 --> 03:48:32,990
Okay.

5460
03:48:38,890 --> 03:48:39,490
There we go.

5461
03:48:40,890 --> 03:48:41,790
There we go.

5462
03:48:43,130 --> 03:48:44,850
I fucking knew you were a fake.

5463
03:48:45,030 --> 03:48:45,370
I knew.

5464
03:48:45,570 --> 03:48:48,790
Oh my god, but I didn't know you have friends!

5465
03:48:48,790 --> 03:48:49,170
I

5466
03:48:52,260 --> 03:48:52,600
got it!

5467
03:48:52,700 --> 03:48:53,040
He hit it!

5468
03:48:53,140 --> 03:48:53,780
He hit it!

5469
03:48:54,040 --> 03:48:54,200
Oh!

5470
03:48:59,110 --> 03:49:00,270
Thank you guys.

5471
03:49:01,170 --> 03:49:01,690
I...

5472
03:49:13,470 --> 03:49:14,750
Get out of here.

5473
03:49:15,790 --> 03:49:17,250
It worked out.

5474
03:49:20,470 --> 03:49:22,710
Okay, I got more ghost flowers.

5475
03:49:23,270 --> 03:49:26,330
I didn't know they could bring it back up.

5476
03:49:29,150 --> 03:49:30,810
Alright, I'll back up.

5477
03:49:32,190 --> 03:49:33,810
Two steps ahead.

5478
03:49:34,270 --> 03:49:36,270
I'm always two steps ahead.

5479
03:49:40,610 --> 03:49:41,530
It's you.

5480
03:49:43,390 --> 03:49:43,930
How?

5481
03:49:45,370 --> 03:49:45,490
How?

5482
03:49:45,710 --> 03:49:46,130
How?

5483
03:49:49,870 --> 03:49:50,750
Oh my god.

5484
03:49:51,550 --> 03:49:52,470
Oh my god.

5485
03:49:52,590 --> 03:49:52,990
Oh my god.

5486
03:49:54,690 --> 03:49:55,430
That's fine.

5487
03:49:55,610 --> 03:49:55,890
That's fine.

5488
03:49:56,070 --> 03:49:56,490
I'm okay.

5489
03:49:58,430 --> 03:49:59,330
I'm lit.

5490
03:50:01,010 --> 03:50:02,370
First off, down.

5491
03:50:05,450 --> 03:50:07,070
Watch your head and be worried.

5492
03:50:07,250 --> 03:50:08,770
Okay, we'll go down first.

5493
03:50:09,410 --> 03:50:11,710
Just to see why he said first off.

5494
03:50:15,480 --> 03:50:16,460
I love her.

5495
03:50:18,740 --> 03:50:20,960
Was my weapon not too... Oh my god, I didn't even notice.

5496
03:50:24,180 --> 03:50:25,660
What did I do with that?

5497
03:50:27,140 --> 03:50:29,020
Oh my god, you fucker!

5498
03:50:33,730 --> 03:50:35,050
I can't fucking...

5499
03:50:35,850 --> 03:50:37,910
Wait, why can't I move?

5500
03:50:39,910 --> 03:50:43,510
Oh my god, he fucking hit me when I couldn't move!

5501
03:50:49,950 --> 03:50:51,370
Oh my god.

5502
03:50:54,270 --> 03:50:55,210
It's fine.

5503
03:50:56,430 --> 03:50:57,370
It's fine.

5504
03:50:57,550 --> 03:50:58,670
I had to press Y.

5505
03:50:58,990 --> 03:50:59,870
Oh my god.

5506
03:51:00,170 --> 03:51:01,130
I had to press Y.

5507
03:51:03,790 --> 03:51:04,310
Alright.

5508
03:51:04,310 --> 03:51:05,110
It's time.

5509
03:51:10,380 --> 03:51:11,080
It's fine.

5510
03:51:11,080 --> 03:51:11,840
We got enough.

5511
03:51:12,000 --> 03:51:12,620
We got enough.

5512
03:51:12,840 --> 03:51:13,860
We got enough.

5513
03:51:14,040 --> 03:51:14,440
It's fine.

5514
03:51:15,000 --> 03:51:15,920
We got enough.

5515
03:51:17,840 --> 03:51:18,800
Oh, it's a cat.

5516
03:51:20,720 --> 03:51:21,980
Don't worry, I've got it.

5517
03:51:22,400 --> 03:51:24,780
Oh, I've seen this guy in Night Ring.

5518
03:51:26,540 --> 03:51:27,600
Holy fuck.

5519
03:51:28,280 --> 03:51:29,620
That's a big-ass cat.

5520
03:51:29,880 --> 03:51:30,620
That's not a rat.

5521
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:32,100
Don't be lying to me.

5522
03:51:32,100 --> 03:51:34,160
He said it was a rat.

5523
03:51:40,470 --> 03:51:41,850
Jesus Christ.

5524
03:51:48,260 --> 03:51:49,020
Okay.

5525
03:51:52,920 --> 03:51:53,680
Alright.

5526
03:51:59,080 --> 03:52:00,220
Got greedy.

5527
03:52:04,080 --> 03:52:05,300
Okay, that's fine.

5528
03:52:06,460 --> 03:52:07,460
That's fine.

5529
03:52:08,840 --> 03:52:10,440
Too busy looking at him.

5530
03:52:15,240 --> 03:52:16,700
Oh, I got greedy again.

5531
03:52:17,360 --> 03:52:18,660
I never learned.

5532
03:52:19,120 --> 03:52:20,360
Why don't I ever learn?

5533
03:52:20,740 --> 03:52:21,640
Don't be afraid.

5534
03:52:25,220 --> 03:52:26,160
There we go.

5535
03:52:26,360 --> 03:52:26,920
We're fine.

5536
03:52:27,660 --> 03:52:28,440
We're fine.

5537
03:52:28,980 --> 03:52:29,480
Stop.

5538
03:52:30,700 --> 03:52:31,540
That's fine.

5539
03:52:31,720 --> 03:52:32,520
I learned now.

5540
03:52:33,340 --> 03:52:33,820
There we go.

5541
03:52:33,820 --> 03:52:35,440
On that degree.

5542
03:52:36,020 --> 03:52:36,620
Dog.

5543
03:52:37,080 --> 03:52:37,600
Oh, dog.

5544
03:52:38,880 --> 03:52:40,060
Turn to the entrance.

5545
03:52:40,060 --> 03:52:41,720
That's fine.

5546
03:52:41,860 --> 03:52:41,860
That's fine.

5547
03:52:41,860 --> 03:52:42,200
I learned.

5548
03:52:42,720 --> 03:52:45,160
Learning is burners.

5549
03:52:47,700 --> 03:52:51,260
We were definitely over-leveled.

5550
03:52:51,760 --> 03:52:52,160
Alright.

5551
03:52:52,220 --> 03:52:52,840
I learned.

5552
03:52:54,860 --> 03:52:55,820
No.

5553
03:52:55,980 --> 03:52:57,880
We are committed to the jellyfish.

5554
03:53:00,760 --> 03:53:02,080
Okay, maybe this time.

5555
03:53:02,460 --> 03:53:03,580
Okay, so there was a flower.

5556
03:53:07,320 --> 03:53:09,440
Is he still- Oh my god, he's still at it.

5557
03:53:12,880 --> 03:53:13,720
Yeah, I can make it.

5558
03:53:13,760 --> 03:53:14,200
I can make it.

5559
03:53:14,260 --> 03:53:14,760
I can make it.

5560
03:53:15,400 --> 03:53:16,320
I can make it.

5561
03:53:16,380 --> 03:53:17,400
I knew I could make it.

5562
03:53:18,760 --> 03:53:19,480
Wait, what?

5563
03:53:20,460 --> 03:53:22,240
Is there a guy following me?

5564
03:53:30,280 --> 03:53:31,000
Oh, hey.

5565
03:53:31,140 --> 03:53:31,380
I am.

5566
03:53:32,660 --> 03:53:33,980
Oh, there is the flower.

5567
03:53:36,320 --> 03:53:37,740
Oh, but what's over here?

5568
03:53:40,740 --> 03:53:42,000
Oh, I see you.

5569
03:53:44,060 --> 03:53:45,540
I fucking see you.

5570
03:53:45,660 --> 03:53:46,640
That's fucking right.

5571
03:53:46,820 --> 03:53:47,620
Get over here.

5572
03:53:47,920 --> 03:53:49,060
I see you.

5573
03:53:49,280 --> 03:53:50,480
Get your ass over here.

5574
03:53:50,720 --> 03:53:51,300
Come on.

5575
03:53:51,760 --> 03:53:53,500
Get your ass over here, bitch.

5576
03:53:53,500 --> 03:53:53,720
Bitch.

5577
03:53:58,040 --> 03:53:59,880
Okay, I- I don't know, man.

5578
03:54:02,220 --> 03:54:03,140
Oh, fuck this.

5579
03:54:03,260 --> 03:54:04,020
I don't need that flower.

5580
03:54:07,500 --> 03:54:08,240
Fuck that.

5581
03:54:08,960 --> 03:54:10,000
I'll get this flower.

5582
03:54:10,120 --> 03:54:10,500
I'm leaving.

5583
03:54:12,380 --> 03:54:13,460
We could have that.

5584
03:54:18,820 --> 03:54:19,880
Alright, we go back.

5585
03:54:20,140 --> 03:54:21,600
We have our flower for our jellyfish.

5586
03:54:25,000 --> 03:54:25,820
Joki out.

5587
03:54:28,540 --> 03:54:31,220
Look at all these people that died to that cat thing.

5588
03:54:31,760 --> 03:54:33,000
It can't be me.

5589
03:54:33,540 --> 03:54:35,420
Not like I'm over leveled or anything.

5590
03:54:40,160 --> 03:54:42,560
I don't need that imps validation!

5591
03:54:49,150 --> 03:54:52,190
Alright, now I can level up the jellyfish.

5592
03:54:58,710 --> 03:54:59,310
Alright.

5593
03:54:59,730 --> 03:55:01,670
Time to finally evolve my jellyfish.

5594
03:55:03,850 --> 03:55:06,530
I want one day eventually accidentally hit him.

5595
03:55:10,900 --> 03:55:12,480
Oh my god.

5596
03:55:13,160 --> 03:55:15,000
Where the fuck is that?

5597
03:55:15,880 --> 03:55:18,720
I didn't do an- I'm not doing another dungeon.

5598
03:55:18,880 --> 03:55:19,260
Let's go.

5599
03:55:20,160 --> 03:55:21,320
We're going in.

5600
03:55:21,640 --> 03:55:23,700
I'm not doing another dungeon, guys.

5601
03:55:24,040 --> 03:55:24,740
We're going in.

5602
03:55:25,800 --> 03:55:26,240
Here?

5603
03:55:28,240 --> 03:55:29,480
Where was it?

5604
03:55:33,280 --> 03:55:33,720
I don't remember.

5605
03:55:33,720 --> 03:55:34,020
Oh, thank god.

5606
03:55:34,200 --> 03:55:36,520
I keep worrying that I might accidentally...

5607
03:55:37,420 --> 03:55:37,860
Like...

5608
03:55:37,860 --> 03:55:38,900
Accidentally, like, hit her.

5609
03:55:41,780 --> 03:55:42,700
Where was it?

5610
03:55:42,800 --> 03:55:43,620
I don't remember.

5611
03:55:44,920 --> 03:55:45,700
Oh, debate parlor.

5612
03:55:45,820 --> 03:55:46,860
Okay, I have to go up the rocks.

5613
03:55:51,940 --> 03:55:52,380
Okay.

5614
03:55:53,280 --> 03:55:54,440
Alright, it's rock time.

5615
03:55:55,100 --> 03:55:55,920
Rock time!

5616
03:55:56,160 --> 03:55:56,640
Rock time!

5617
03:55:56,640 --> 03:55:56,940
Rock time!

5618
03:55:57,080 --> 03:55:57,800
Rock time!

5619
03:55:59,340 --> 03:56:00,840
Rock time!

5620
03:56:03,340 --> 03:56:04,580
Alright, here we go.

5621
03:56:11,720 --> 03:56:12,400
Alright.

5622
03:56:14,420 --> 03:56:15,560
Jump down!

5623
03:56:18,040 --> 03:56:18,760
Alright.

5624
03:56:19,100 --> 03:56:19,460
Nice.

5625
03:56:20,460 --> 03:56:22,120
I just know I have to go this way.

5626
03:56:23,880 --> 03:56:25,300
And I should make it.

5627
03:56:30,480 --> 03:56:31,500
Here we go.

5628
03:56:33,880 --> 03:56:34,980
I believe.

5629
03:56:34,980 --> 03:56:38,500
I believe... I believe in us, guys.

5630
03:56:43,500 --> 03:56:44,300
I...

5631
03:56:58,720 --> 03:57:03,560
I thought... I didn't realize the elevator wasn't there anymore.

5632
03:57:08,890 --> 03:57:14,030
I just... I just... I thought it was...

5633
03:57:14,030 --> 03:57:16,290
The elevator is quite black right now.

5634
03:57:20,290 --> 03:57:20,950
Okay.

5635
03:57:21,570 --> 03:57:21,890
Okay.

5636
03:57:23,110 --> 03:57:24,410
Let's go back.

5637
03:57:27,930 --> 03:57:31,870
It's like, you know when it doesn't move, I can't see it.

5638
03:57:35,840 --> 03:57:39,370
When it doesn't move, it can't see it, you know?

5639
03:57:40,730 --> 03:57:43,190
Don't keep believing too hard.

5640
03:57:44,350 --> 03:57:45,170
Usually...

5641
03:57:45,720 --> 03:57:46,550
Oh my god.

5642
03:57:46,830 --> 03:57:49,450
Usually the elevator is on...

5643
03:57:49,450 --> 03:57:52,530
Usually the elevator is below on default.

5644
03:57:52,830 --> 03:57:55,870
How was I supposed to know it wasn't on default?

5645
03:57:57,690 --> 03:57:58,810
Get your goat.

5646
03:58:01,070 --> 03:58:04,170
My vision is based on movement.

5647
03:58:06,970 --> 03:58:08,170
Alright, here we go.

5648
03:58:18,050 --> 03:58:19,150
Alright, where am I?

5649
03:58:21,970 --> 03:58:23,190
Oh my god.

5650
03:58:23,530 --> 03:58:24,750
Oh, it's the teachers.

5651
03:58:26,690 --> 03:58:28,690
Oh, it's the Grand Professor.

5652
03:58:40,760 --> 03:58:42,580
Oh my god, that's so creepy.

5653
03:58:46,370 --> 03:58:47,950
It's the ultimate nerd.

5654
03:58:50,050 --> 03:58:52,250
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

5655
03:58:52,790 --> 03:58:55,270
There's so many of these nerds!

5656
03:58:57,590 --> 03:58:58,870
Where's the Grand Nerd?

5657
03:59:00,750 --> 03:59:02,010
There she is.

5658
03:59:04,110 --> 03:59:05,150
What?

5659
03:59:07,690 --> 03:59:08,730
What?

5660
03:59:08,730 --> 03:59:09,130
What's that?

5661
03:59:09,650 --> 03:59:12,510
Oh, is that the wound?

5662
03:59:13,790 --> 03:59:17,790
A sweeting, fresh, and pure...

5663
03:59:23,520 --> 03:59:26,160
The jellyfish is a strong spirit!

5664
03:59:26,680 --> 03:59:27,860
I'll show you.

5665
03:59:28,160 --> 03:59:29,780
I'll show you all.

5666
03:59:30,600 --> 03:59:32,280
Oh, fuck my legs.

5667
03:59:36,780 --> 03:59:37,740
My knees.

5668
03:59:54,740 --> 03:59:58,680
Oh my god, I'm trying so hard to let... Oh, there she is.

5669
03:59:59,060 --> 04:00:00,240
Wait, no, where is she?

5670
04:00:01,480 --> 04:00:02,740
Oh my god, there she is.

5671
04:00:05,140 --> 04:00:07,480
I found her for real this time.

5672
04:00:09,420 --> 04:00:11,280
I was like, wait a minute.

5673
04:00:11,780 --> 04:00:12,520
Oh, fuck.

5674
04:00:12,680 --> 04:00:14,340
Oh, I didn't realize that was a move.

5675
04:00:20,670 --> 04:00:21,270
Okay.

5676
04:00:21,270 --> 04:00:22,590
Oh my god.

5677
04:00:28,320 --> 04:00:29,480
Where are they singing?

5678
04:00:43,690 --> 04:00:45,110
Oh my god!

5679
04:00:51,800 --> 04:00:52,660
Who's singing?

5680
04:00:53,000 --> 04:00:54,240
Oh, they're not singing anymore.

5681
04:00:54,580 --> 04:00:54,960
Okay.

5682
04:01:02,680 --> 04:01:03,760
Stop singing!

5683
04:01:06,880 --> 04:01:07,480
Okay.

5684
04:01:08,220 --> 04:01:08,700
All right.

5685
04:01:12,090 --> 04:01:13,970
No, I know there's phase two, guys.

5686
04:01:14,150 --> 04:01:19,390
I saw... I saw the... I saw a lot of people fighting this boss.

5687
04:01:19,390 --> 04:01:21,750
I know there's a... You can't fuck with me.

5688
04:01:22,070 --> 04:01:22,750
I...

5689
04:01:22,750 --> 04:01:22,770
I...

5690
04:01:22,770 --> 04:01:23,370
Ah,

5691
04:01:29,030 --> 04:01:30,310
my beloved.

5692
04:01:32,090 --> 04:01:33,730
Have no fear.

5693
04:01:34,190 --> 04:01:36,390
I will hold thee...

5694
04:01:37,290 --> 04:01:37,970
Patience.

5695
04:01:39,190 --> 04:01:40,330
Oh, there he is.

5696
04:01:40,330 --> 04:01:40,930
Patience.

5697
04:01:45,670 --> 04:01:46,610
I killed her.

5698
04:01:47,310 --> 04:01:48,670
That's why I killed your mom.

5699
04:01:49,010 --> 04:01:50,010
What you gonna do now?

5700
04:01:50,850 --> 04:01:53,550
I know you're a lot harder, but what you gonna do now?

5701
04:02:06,310 --> 04:02:07,090
Oh, shit.

5702
04:02:07,710 --> 04:02:09,430
Wait, you grew up so tall.

5703
04:02:11,030 --> 04:02:12,010
What the fuck?

5704
04:02:12,190 --> 04:02:13,190
You were just four!

5705
04:02:13,190 --> 04:02:16,850
Send word, far and wide.

5706
04:02:25,240 --> 04:02:27,580
Of the last queen of Karia.

5707
04:02:28,640 --> 04:02:30,200
Oh, where did she take me?

5708
04:02:30,920 --> 04:02:31,720
Oh my god.

5709
04:02:31,760 --> 04:02:33,000
Where did she take me?

5710
04:02:35,980 --> 04:02:37,480
Oh, that's her mom?

5711
04:02:39,700 --> 04:02:40,780
Oh, shit.

5712
04:02:41,580 --> 04:02:42,220
That's right.

5713
04:02:42,240 --> 04:02:43,080
I beat up your daughter.

5714
04:02:43,300 --> 04:02:44,300
What you gonna do now?

5715
04:02:49,630 --> 04:02:51,760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

5716
04:02:52,300 --> 04:02:52,960
Where's my octopus?

5717
04:02:53,240 --> 04:02:54,120
Oh, there she is.

5718
04:02:58,910 --> 04:03:00,290
Oh my god.

5719
04:03:06,610 --> 04:03:09,250
Wait, she fucking just walked away?!

5720
04:03:11,770 --> 04:03:12,310
Okay.

5721
04:03:12,890 --> 04:03:14,350
Oh my god, that's fucking...

5722
04:03:14,350 --> 04:03:14,930
That's illegal.

5723
04:03:16,530 --> 04:03:17,030
Fuck her.

5724
04:03:18,290 --> 04:03:19,030
What's she doing?

5725
04:03:21,730 --> 04:03:24,030
Like, I don't know half of these moves that she's doing.

5726
04:03:25,290 --> 04:03:27,770
But to be fair, I am fighting her for the first time.

5727
04:03:31,210 --> 04:03:32,330
Oh my god, what's she doing?

5728
04:03:32,490 --> 04:03:33,090
What's she doing?

5729
04:03:33,230 --> 04:03:34,390
She's the fucking moon!

5730
04:03:35,130 --> 04:03:37,030
What do I do when she's the moon?!

5731
04:03:40,850 --> 04:03:41,730
Oh, shit!

5732
04:03:41,950 --> 04:03:42,130
Okay.

5733
04:03:42,770 --> 04:03:43,330
I'll get...

5734
04:03:43,330 --> 04:03:44,310
Oh my god!

5735
04:03:50,070 --> 04:03:51,130
Oh no, no.

5736
04:03:59,520 --> 04:03:59,960
Okay.

5737
04:04:01,060 --> 04:04:02,060
Oh, you guys are praised!

5738
04:04:02,240 --> 04:04:03,260
I didn't see you guys are praised!

5739
04:04:05,500 --> 04:04:05,900
I

5740
04:04:09,000 --> 04:04:09,400
didn't see you guys are praised!

5741
04:04:09,820 --> 04:04:10,700
Oh my god.

5742
04:04:15,480 --> 04:04:16,820
Oh my god, not the moon.

5743
04:04:17,680 --> 04:04:18,480
Not the moon.

5744
04:04:21,760 --> 04:04:22,160
Oh!

5745
04:04:23,000 --> 04:04:24,480
Oh my god, now there's dogs!

5746
04:04:38,030 --> 04:04:39,210
Jesus fucking Christ.

5747
04:04:42,010 --> 04:04:43,570
Oh, what the fuck is that?!

5748
04:04:57,320 --> 04:04:58,920
I don't know where she is!

5749
04:04:59,160 --> 04:05:00,280
I'm so lost!

5750
04:05:00,980 --> 04:05:01,800
Oh my god!

5751
04:05:02,240 --> 04:05:02,460
Oh my god!

5752
04:05:02,460 --> 04:05:02,480
No!

5753
04:05:04,120 --> 04:05:04,700
No!

5754
04:05:25,790 --> 04:05:27,670
Oh, I got greedy!

5755
04:05:28,050 --> 04:05:29,750
I got so greedy!

5756
04:05:32,510 --> 04:05:33,530
I didn't...

5757
04:05:33,530 --> 04:05:35,250
I thought I could get the heal off!

5758
04:05:35,880 --> 04:05:37,530
I thought I could get it off!

5759
04:05:38,790 --> 04:05:39,910
I almost...

5760
04:05:39,910 --> 04:05:41,030
I got greedy!

5761
04:05:41,310 --> 04:05:44,010
Why do I always get so greedy?!

5762
04:05:44,530 --> 04:05:45,290
I just...

5763
04:05:45,290 --> 04:05:46,650
It was so low!

5764
04:05:47,070 --> 04:05:48,330
I saw it!

5765
04:05:50,510 --> 04:05:51,650
I saw it!

5766
04:05:51,650 --> 04:05:52,550
It was so low!

5767
04:05:52,710 --> 04:05:53,830
And I was like, I got this!

5768
04:05:53,970 --> 04:05:54,530
I could just...

5769
04:05:54,530 --> 04:05:55,250
Oh!

5770
04:05:57,910 --> 04:05:58,490
I...

5771
04:05:58,490 --> 04:05:59,770
I saw it!

5772
04:05:59,890 --> 04:06:00,710
And I was like...

5773
04:06:00,710 --> 04:06:00,850
Oh!

5774
04:06:02,050 --> 04:06:02,910
That's right!

5775
04:06:03,230 --> 04:06:04,270
I got you!

5776
04:06:04,910 --> 04:06:05,090
Oh!

5777
04:06:07,950 --> 04:06:08,810
Oh my god!

5778
04:06:09,530 --> 04:06:10,250
Leverage this!

5779
04:06:10,470 --> 04:06:10,830
Oh my god.

5780
04:06:10,910 --> 04:06:11,590
Okay, I didn't go through.

5781
04:06:13,870 --> 04:06:14,450
Oh...

5782
04:06:14,450 --> 04:06:16,230
No, now it's downhill!

5783
04:06:16,230 --> 04:06:16,470
Downhill.

5784
04:06:16,610 --> 04:06:18,490
I always do the best on my first try.

5785
04:06:18,770 --> 04:06:20,070
Now it's downhill, chat.

5786
04:06:23,230 --> 04:06:24,710
Oh my god.

5787
04:06:25,950 --> 04:06:27,330
Revenge of the Nerd.

5788
04:06:28,190 --> 04:06:30,750
I'll never learn to not be greedy.

5789
04:06:31,170 --> 04:06:32,690
I'll never learn.

5790
04:06:34,310 --> 04:06:35,850
That's the worst part.

5791
04:06:41,930 --> 04:06:43,930
Oh my god, and I did so well.

5792
04:06:44,050 --> 04:06:45,070
That's the worst part, too.

5793
04:06:45,170 --> 04:06:46,430
I actually was doing so well.

5794
04:06:46,850 --> 04:06:47,890
I'm so sad.

5795
04:06:50,190 --> 04:06:50,310
Huh.

5796
04:06:53,870 --> 04:06:57,990
The worst part is that I know that I'm not going to do as good as that run now.

5797
04:07:01,670 --> 04:07:03,410
Like, that was actually my best run.

5798
04:07:03,610 --> 04:07:04,970
That's going to be my best run.

5799
04:07:05,210 --> 04:07:06,750
And we all know it.

5800
04:07:25,810 --> 04:07:26,470
There we go.

5801
04:07:27,910 --> 04:07:29,650
Oh my god, a fucking course.

5802
04:07:32,130 --> 04:07:32,810
Where is he?

5803
04:07:33,230 --> 04:07:34,010
He's over there.

5804
04:07:38,260 --> 04:07:38,660
Okay.

5805
04:07:40,240 --> 04:07:41,880
Okay, here's one of them.

5806
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:48,400
Where's the other singer?

5807
04:07:51,800 --> 04:07:53,180
Oh my god, where is he?

5808
04:07:53,820 --> 04:07:55,240
I don't see him.

5809
04:07:59,500 --> 04:08:00,740
Oh my god!

5810
04:08:01,020 --> 04:08:03,000
I don't know where the other fucking singer is!

5811
04:08:05,360 --> 04:08:06,300
I hear her!

5812
04:08:07,860 --> 04:08:08,800
I hear her!

5813
04:08:12,320 --> 04:08:14,080
Get out of me, you whore!

5814
04:08:15,940 --> 04:08:16,960
Oh, I see you!

5815
04:08:21,480 --> 04:08:22,500
That's the last one!

5816
04:08:23,200 --> 04:08:26,020
I know that's the last- Wait, that's not the last one?

5817
04:08:26,140 --> 04:08:27,980
Oh, I know that's the last one!

5818
04:08:30,160 --> 04:08:35,670
I know that's the last one!

5819
04:08:35,670 --> 04:08:36,710
One more hit!

5820
04:08:36,990 --> 04:08:37,310
Yes!

5821
04:08:39,570 --> 04:08:40,270
Okay!

5822
04:08:42,830 --> 04:08:43,390
Okay.

5823
04:08:43,550 --> 04:08:43,550
Okay.

5824
04:08:58,180 --> 04:08:59,220
Oh, nice.

5825
04:08:59,600 --> 04:09:00,160
Go, squid.

5826
04:09:00,340 --> 04:09:00,460
Go.

5827
04:09:00,880 --> 04:09:01,260
Go.

5828
04:09:01,480 --> 04:09:02,020
Oh, fuck.

5829
04:09:08,790 --> 04:09:09,530
That's fine.

5830
04:09:09,930 --> 04:09:10,890
That's not fine.

5831
04:09:20,970 --> 04:09:21,530
Okay.

5832
04:09:23,270 --> 04:09:24,390
I hate you.

5833
04:09:24,570 --> 04:09:26,310
I hate you so much.

5834
04:09:30,440 --> 04:09:32,360
Why do you keep doing this to me?

5835
04:09:33,680 --> 04:09:34,600
Oh, my God.

5836
04:09:34,680 --> 04:09:35,260
Not the moon.

5837
04:09:36,040 --> 04:09:37,080
Not the moon.

5838
04:09:39,480 --> 04:09:40,820
Not the moon.

5839
04:09:45,910 --> 04:09:47,450
Not the moon!

5840
04:09:53,960 --> 04:09:54,720
Okay.

5841
04:09:57,430 --> 04:09:59,350
Jesus, he keeps... she keeps just...

5842
04:10:02,810 --> 04:10:03,570
Okay.

5843
04:10:04,490 --> 04:10:06,130
Are you fucking kidding me?

5844
04:10:10,440 --> 04:10:11,200
I...

5845
04:10:15,540 --> 04:10:16,840
It's the range.

5846
04:10:27,260 --> 04:10:28,160
Okay.

5847
04:10:33,570 --> 04:10:34,020
Okay.

5848
04:10:34,470 --> 04:10:34,690
All right.

5849
04:10:35,970 --> 04:10:37,630
Just gotta slowly walk over.

5850
04:10:37,910 --> 04:10:39,870
I just gotta slowly...

5851
04:10:41,690 --> 04:10:43,430
You fucker!

5852
04:10:43,430 --> 04:10:46,170
You actual fucker!

5853
04:10:50,150 --> 04:10:51,130
Oh, my God!

5854
04:10:52,390 --> 04:10:54,510
You had to send in the troll!

5855
04:11:02,310 --> 04:11:02,770
Yes.

5856
04:11:03,190 --> 04:11:03,470
Okay.

5857
04:11:05,970 --> 04:11:07,430
I hate you so much.

5858
04:11:13,010 --> 04:11:13,850
Okay.

5859
04:11:26,540 --> 04:11:27,540
I don't trust myself.

5860
04:11:27,760 --> 04:11:28,520
I knew it!

5861
04:11:28,820 --> 04:11:29,280
I knew it!

5862
04:11:34,180 --> 04:11:34,920
Oh, my God.

5863
04:11:35,020 --> 04:11:36,020
Get closer, you fucking whore.

5864
04:11:36,020 --> 04:11:36,120
Get closer, you fucking whore!

5865
04:11:48,250 --> 04:11:48,850
Please!

5866
04:11:53,460 --> 04:11:54,720
It's fucking wolves.

5867
04:12:01,030 --> 04:12:01,630
Okay.

5868
04:12:04,530 --> 04:12:05,370
There you go.

5869
04:12:05,750 --> 04:12:08,070
She only lets me hit her once this time!

5870
04:12:11,800 --> 04:12:13,240
Oh, my God.

5871
04:12:13,240 --> 04:12:13,500
I hate you.

5872
04:12:13,520 --> 04:12:15,440
I hate you so much.

5873
04:12:15,540 --> 04:12:17,680
I hate you so much.

5874
04:12:18,540 --> 04:12:19,260
Oh

5875
04:12:26,480 --> 04:12:26,820
my god.

5876
04:12:26,960 --> 04:12:27,820
I hate you.

5877
04:12:33,120 --> 04:12:34,200
Oh my god.

5878
04:12:34,900 --> 04:12:35,500
Watch you.

5879
04:12:35,740 --> 04:12:37,040
I'm looking for you.

5880
04:12:43,770 --> 04:12:44,830
You fucker.

5881
04:12:54,530 --> 04:12:55,590
Oh my god.

5882
04:13:00,410 --> 04:13:02,330
No, you fucker!

5883
04:13:06,820 --> 04:13:07,540
Okay.

5884
04:13:10,800 --> 04:13:11,680
One hit.

5885
04:13:12,520 --> 04:13:13,820
That's fucking right!

5886
04:13:13,820 --> 04:13:14,700
Oh my god.

5887
04:13:14,860 --> 04:13:15,200
Oh my god.

5888
04:13:15,300 --> 04:13:15,960
The wolves are coming.

5889
04:13:18,220 --> 04:13:19,960
Oh my god.

5890
04:13:20,540 --> 04:13:21,920
Oh my god.

5891
04:13:22,540 --> 04:13:22,700
Rush here.

5892
04:13:23,020 --> 04:13:23,520
Rush me.

5893
04:13:24,220 --> 04:13:25,280
Rush me.

5894
04:13:26,000 --> 04:13:27,220
Oh, he did it.

5895
04:13:27,760 --> 04:13:28,460
He did it.

5896
04:13:30,760 --> 04:13:33,520
I had to be so patient there.

5897
04:13:34,100 --> 04:13:35,620
Oh my god.

5898
04:13:39,950 --> 04:13:41,830
Oh my god.

5899
04:13:42,190 --> 04:13:42,190
Oh my god.

5900
04:13:43,030 --> 04:13:45,310
Oh, we did it.

5901
04:13:45,570 --> 04:13:47,590
You flee, my sweetings.

5902
04:13:47,830 --> 04:13:50,490
Come out from whence ye hide.

5903
04:13:50,490 --> 04:13:50,970
What's that?

5904
04:13:51,850 --> 04:13:55,190
There are books and light aplenty.

5905
04:13:55,490 --> 04:13:57,530
That's such a huge rune.

5906
04:13:57,910 --> 04:13:59,410
Come out, say I.

5907
04:13:59,670 --> 04:14:05,630
Or will ye be gravestones to be better born anew?

5908
04:14:13,150 --> 04:14:14,430
What are you talking to?

5909
04:14:14,570 --> 04:14:14,710
Me?

5910
04:14:15,050 --> 04:14:16,770
To become a sweeting...

5911
04:14:17,690 --> 04:14:20,870
Reborn of my beloved egg.

5912
04:14:21,410 --> 04:14:22,950
Oh, she's friend now?

5913
04:14:23,210 --> 04:14:23,710
Oh!

5914
04:14:24,370 --> 04:14:25,470
Wait, what's this for?

5915
04:14:30,090 --> 04:14:30,690
Reborn of my beloved egg.

5916
04:14:30,690 --> 04:14:31,730
And change how I look.

5917
04:14:34,170 --> 04:14:35,350
Wait, what's rebirth?

5918
04:14:36,770 --> 04:14:38,690
A larval tear is...

5919
04:14:40,210 --> 04:14:42,890
She respect... Oh, you can respect stats?

5920
04:14:45,750 --> 04:14:46,350
Oh!

5921
04:14:47,390 --> 04:14:50,490
Oh, so like if I don't like my stuff, I can reset everything.

5922
04:14:50,490 --> 04:14:51,350
Oh!

5923
04:14:52,010 --> 04:14:52,550
Oh, I see.

5924
04:14:54,250 --> 04:14:55,210
I see.

5925
04:14:57,250 --> 04:14:58,570
What if I kill her?

5926
04:14:59,210 --> 04:14:59,950
Do I get...

5927
04:14:59,950 --> 04:15:01,610
If I kill her, do I get souls?

5928
04:15:06,430 --> 04:15:08,650
I don't need to respect anything.

5929
04:15:14,910 --> 04:15:17,030
All right, Vigor or Dex, guys?

5930
04:15:21,120 --> 04:15:21,680
He can...

5931
04:15:21,680 --> 04:15:22,280
Oh, she's...

5932
04:15:22,280 --> 04:15:22,960
God damn it.

5933
04:15:23,360 --> 04:15:23,900
God damn it.

5934
04:15:23,940 --> 04:15:25,080
I want her out of here.

5935
04:15:25,300 --> 04:15:26,360
I want that egg.

5936
04:15:26,600 --> 04:15:28,700
I want that giant ass rune.

5937
04:15:29,440 --> 04:15:30,720
Okay, Vigor to 30.

5938
04:15:31,080 --> 04:15:31,860
Oh, I can get it to 30.

5939
04:15:34,580 --> 04:15:35,960
All right, Vigor to 30.

5940
04:15:36,660 --> 04:15:37,080
We do it?

5941
04:15:37,260 --> 04:15:38,500
Vigor to 30, guys?

5942
04:15:43,100 --> 04:15:44,060
Okay, hit 30.

5943
04:15:44,380 --> 04:15:45,240
Okay, now what?

5944
04:15:45,480 --> 04:15:45,660
Dex?

5945
04:15:51,950 --> 04:15:53,450
The Arcane and Dex?

5946
04:15:53,570 --> 04:15:54,330
What's Arcane for?

5947
04:15:59,710 --> 04:16:00,470
We do...

5948
04:16:00,470 --> 04:16:01,630
Do we actually need Arcane?

5949
04:16:02,830 --> 04:16:05,350
Okay, I'll put one in Dex and one in Arcane.

5950
04:16:05,590 --> 04:16:06,770
Okay, I'll put one in the other.

5951
04:16:07,010 --> 04:16:07,590
All right, guys.

5952
04:16:07,770 --> 04:16:08,690
I'm gonna call it here.

5953
04:16:08,930 --> 04:16:09,850
We did two bosses.

5954
04:16:11,390 --> 04:16:12,290
I'm gonna call it here.

5955
04:16:12,350 --> 04:16:13,390
I'm going back to the round table.

5956
04:16:13,630 --> 04:16:14,070
Fuck this.

5957
04:16:14,750 --> 04:16:15,490
I'm going back home.

5958
04:16:17,930 --> 04:16:18,550
All right.

5959
04:16:20,170 --> 04:16:21,750
Oh, we're gonna call it here.

5960
04:16:21,950 --> 04:16:22,830
We did two bosses.

5961
04:16:23,230 --> 04:16:24,790
I need to pick up that today.

5962
04:16:25,090 --> 04:16:26,150
Oh, I can have new items.

5963
04:16:26,310 --> 04:16:26,510
Nice.

5964
04:16:27,250 --> 04:16:30,470
But thank you, everybody, for coming.

5965
04:16:30,630 --> 04:16:32,350
I really appreciate it, guys.

5966
04:16:32,870 --> 04:16:35,110
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

5967
04:16:36,230 --> 04:16:38,310
I'm gonna have to pick up that now.

5968
04:16:38,530 --> 04:16:39,050
But don't worry.

5969
04:16:39,150 --> 04:16:40,570
Tomorrow is a double stream day.

5970
04:16:40,570 --> 04:16:42,510
So you're just gonna be double the Doki's.

5971
04:16:42,590 --> 04:16:43,350
The double D's.

5972
04:16:45,190 --> 04:16:46,750
But thank you all for coming.

5973
04:16:47,070 --> 04:16:51,250
As I'm gonna go head out because I was supposed to pick him up like 30 an hour ago.

5974
04:16:52,810 --> 04:16:58,870
So I hope I don't get charged extra for taking a while to pick him up.

5975
04:17:01,370 --> 04:17:03,410
I really wanted to beat another boss.

5976
04:17:03,970 --> 04:17:05,170
Anyway, but don't worry.

5977
04:17:05,250 --> 04:17:06,330
It's a 24 hour hospital.

5978
04:17:06,590 --> 04:17:08,650
So like, he was getting a checkup done.

5979
04:17:09,190 --> 04:17:10,090
So, yeah.

5980
04:17:10,370 --> 04:17:10,870
Anyway, guys.

5981
04:17:11,070 --> 04:17:12,310
As always, everybody.

5982
04:17:12,550 --> 04:17:13,470
Stay hydrated.

5983
04:17:13,710 --> 04:17:14,190
Pacha check.

5984
04:17:14,450 --> 04:17:16,170
Get him around to get that blood flowing.

5985
04:17:16,350 --> 04:17:17,990
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

5986
04:17:18,130 --> 04:17:19,310
Because you deserve it.

5987
04:17:19,470 --> 04:17:21,190
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5988
04:17:21,590 --> 04:17:22,410
Bye, guys.

5989
04:17:23,110 --> 04:17:23,550
Bye.

5990
04:17:23,550 --> 04:17:23,710
Bye.
