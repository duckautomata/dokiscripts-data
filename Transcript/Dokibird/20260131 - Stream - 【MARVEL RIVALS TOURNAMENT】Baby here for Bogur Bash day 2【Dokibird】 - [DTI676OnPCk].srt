Vlad now.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,200
I mean, what does he play?

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,300
Then he has to play Thing 2 and that's kind of it.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,160
I got...

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,120
Do they have a good player?

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,880
Who's the other tank player?

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,300
Vlad's just playing a lot of Deadpool tank.

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,580
You know what would cheer me up?

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,900
Times Square.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,980
I think it just falls for you.

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,180
Here we go.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,340
It's usually on Deadpool or Thor.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,680
Hey, give me a sec.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,180
The tier, don't worry.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,840
I know what to do to dry these tiers.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,780
That's right.

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,720
I know what to do to dry these tiers.

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,260
It trickles down.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,640
I shall continue the cycle.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,020
Alright, come on.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,820
One of you.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,620
this time.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,520
Oh, Gabe.

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,140
Wait, he's level one.

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:33,720
Wait, Gabe?

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,820
9-1?

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,360
Bro, this guy's a natural baby.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,780
Gabe, where are you, Gabe?

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,620
Gabe.

34
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,140
Oh, Gabe.

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,760
Found out an actual child is here.

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,620
Oh, it's Jared.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,820
Okay, Jared.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,420
Wait, no.

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,420
Where the fuck did Gabe go?

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,500
Where he left?

41
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,760
Gabe left.

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,100
I mean, what do you when I save them.

43
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,460
Invis?

44
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,200
No!

45
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,020
Where else can I take my...

46
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,000
Where else can I be like...

47
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,780
Where else can I do that?

48
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,220
Also, if I have e-business, like...

49
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,900
Where are the children out?

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Where are the little kids?

51
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,300
I got dope.

52
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,840
Now I must beat up children.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,320
In-game, in-game, in-game, in-game, guys, in-game.

54
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,240
Okay, Maron's keeping you.

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,140
Stop.

56
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,800
There we go.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,740
We continue the cycle.

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,340
All right, let's see.

59
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,500
I got Tex Moe.

60
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,620
Oh, my God, Josiah.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,040
Someone will say yes.

62
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,340
Alright, let's see it.

63
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,600
There's so many console players, actually.

64
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,420
It really is a lot.

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,940
Oh, it's Josiah again.

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,300
God damn it, Josiah, leave.

67
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,440
You don't want to fight.

68
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,280
I actually think that's a good idea.

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:20,880
Alright, chess.

70
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,320
I don't really think that's a really good idea.

71
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,160
Where's chess?

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
Because then, like, the next two bands are going to be
like...

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,020
Oh, there's chess.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,140
We go Lentus and Jeff or something, and we just...

75
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,380
Yeah.

76
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,560
Happy birthday!

77
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,880
Fantastic.

78
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,000
Thank you for the super chat.

79
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,400
Thank you.

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you.

81
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,880
But watching my comment, you always want to wait for my
friends.

82
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,740
So I got this.

83
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,400
Thank you.

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,440
Thank you for the super chat.

85
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,760
Happy birthday to you.

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Happy birthday to you.

87
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,640
Happy birthday dear.

88
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,400
I like that.

89
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,400
Oh my God.

90
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,120
Child support.

91
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,580
Happy birthday to you.

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,160
I think so too, yeah.

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,600
I think that's a good idea.

94
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm going to clap going against you.

95
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,580
Oh, gee.

96
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,980
Because otherwise, I mean, you guys.

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,100
How did they know?

98
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,920
How did they know what my rank is?

99
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,760
How did they know?

100
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,080
My profile is private just so I can do this.

101
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,680
There's a reason why my profile is private.

102
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,860
Just so I can, just so they don't know.

103
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,760
If we're on EU, yeah, I agree.

104
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,980

108
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,320

109
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,100
My reputation.

110
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,340
I only went to Clobbery Club on stream one time.

111
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,620
And now everyone knows what I did.

112
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,400
Now all of China knows.

113
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,000
I just, I was just there one time.

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,400
And somehow all of China now knows what I do at the Clobbery
Club.

115
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,300
I, I've been exposed.

116
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,220
I don't...

117
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,760

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,980
Nobody's accepting my invites now!

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,680
It was you, wasn't it?

122
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,840
Chat, it was you.

123
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,200
You ratted me out, didn't you?

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,760

130
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,690
What the?

131
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,290
Shit.

132
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,130
Okay, he...

133
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,850
I did not expect her to hit that.

134
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,590
I need my cooldowns.

135
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,190
Okay.

136
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,850
All right.

137
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,790
I can't fucking go in a straight line for her, though.

138
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,470
That's the thing.

139
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,410
All right.

140
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,370
Yo, this is scary.

141
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,100
There we go.

142
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,560
I actually couldn't go in a straight line because of the
headshots.

143
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,680
I didn't want to get headshot.

144
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,440
All right.

145
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,880
My turn.

146
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,740
I was like, oh, shit.

147
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,440
One headshot, I'm out.

148
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,880
No, warn, warn, warn everyone.

149
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,940
She's coming.

150
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,100
Okay.

151
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,440
Scarlet.

152
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,120
It's alright.

153
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,760
If I give her space, she can't get me.

154
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,160
What do I do when she comes over?

155
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,860
Oh, shit.

156
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,200
Wait.

157
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,000
No, I missed the first shot!

158
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah!

159
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,800
Stupid point and click!

160
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,580
I missed the last shot.

161
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:24,060
I'll be fucking I'm pulling it out It's goddamn stupid auto

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,620

165
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,190
I take those.

166
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,590
I'm teaching them a lesson.

167
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,070
There's no such thing as fair play.

168
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,750
I'm merely just teaching them all a fucking lesson.

169
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,690
Life's unfair.

170
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,830
Life's fucking unfair.

171
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,710
They gotta live with it.

172
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,570
I did.

173
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,250
I had to live with it.

174
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,210
Hello, what's your name, Miss?

175
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,070
Uh, you know, now plat is too much.

176
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,970
I already have to deal with that.

177
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,030
That would be such a great bet.

178
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,610
Life's unfair, and you just gotta live with it.

179
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,350
Back to the lobby.

180
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,250
No one will help you.

181
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,670
You gotta fend for yourself.

182
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,410
I don't think so.

183
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,750
I'm still in the schedule.

184

Not a coward.

196

playing um But anyway, but no one played dive.

202
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,590

203
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:43,050
anything because no one was fucking playing dive Like and it
doesn't care about dive and he is like I'm too stupid like

220
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:51,440
it's a bad idea i'm throwing ideas out i think we can try to
do that yeah i think we played like that pool for plus camp

221
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,500
like we should have um i have nine hours this tournament
won't be seven nine hours long

222
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,880
don't worry this tournament won't be nine hours loud we
still got this so anyway we're gonna have to watch a movie

223
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,180
trailer i think some guys because there's some guys might
have watched this already it's called shelter and then i

224
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:25,260
could play arc nights for an hour and then also rivals for
an hour so it's fine so we're first banning magic against

225
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:36,820
this team right yeah i mean not no no no no no no no no no
if they ever save it we can't prevent it but Hey, I still

226
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,380
got time.

227
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,540
I still got time.

228
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,920
But I swear I'm hilarious sometimes.

229
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,270
It's like four hours long.

230
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,030
That's fine.

231
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,610
I just have to play one hour of that tutorial.

232
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,650
That's better for you.

233
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,390
And then I just got to play one hour of that tutorial.

234
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,730
Because it's literally just one hour stream.

235
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,550
I mean, that's good.

236
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,190
More room for cheese.

237
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,710
How would you?

238
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,130
Is that easy?

239
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,170
Sigh.

240
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,590
See, here, I'll read this out.

241
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,070
This is my requirement.

242
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,650
Play one hour of Arc Nights.

243
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,990
And then remember to say, what do I have to say?

244
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,770
Activate my streamer read ad.

245
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,710
And then it's like, we encourage you to integrate all.

246
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:41,170
Okay, and I'd be like, Arc Nights Enfield is a 3D time, real
time strategy RPG available on PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile

247
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:50,230
i'll be like immersive storytelling and do not make i make
sure i do not say anything negative um do not include

248
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:59,390

Okay, it's fine.

251
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,130
This is not the stream.

252
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,130
It's for tonight.

253
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,790
It's for tonight, guys.

254
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:18,230
Let's see.

255
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,150
This is a very... This is a stream.

256
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,890
This is a stream that's not associated with the sponsor.

257
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,070
Yeah.

258
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,090
It's okay.

259
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,630
we're fine I just gotta remember to say all of this

260
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:52,660
you can say on the spot before it's loopo technically I'm
not sponsored yet or attack and if it's bunker we just play

261
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,480
Groot thing or Groot mug stuff like that are you good with
that

262
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:11,020
alright here we go thing is probably the best complain yeah
i just listen i'm a good listener i literally like oh my

263
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:20,220
gosh last night was so rough for me because all i did i i
was just coughing uh i was just coughing uh non-stop last

264
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:31,700
night and i was like it sucks life sucks what was it like
before i coughed i don't remember what that was like

265
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,940
was having a really right after the stream i literally
disassociated like for the rest of the night i was not a

266
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,650
real person i did i i uh

267
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:59,430
uh i sound better now but in the morning i was coughing
really really badly in general

268
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:13,140
we're just saying benland um and team captain team did
against them yesterday I slept a lot.

269
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,420
It's not like we should play Spider-Man, but other than
that, yeah.

270
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,180
I slept a lot, lot.

271
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,380
I mean, like, say Spider-Man.

272
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,400
Does someone say Spider-Man?

273
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
I got real excited.

274
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,800
What did you say?

275
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,600
We're playing Spider-Man?

276
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
I'm down for the mag band in the floods.

277
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,660
I think so, too.

278
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,620
I think it's fine, yeah.

279
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,870
The thing...

280
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,610
I didn't play in front of the bag against them.

281
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,690
It's like, really good.

282
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,210
They don't have that sludge, like, a strong front line.

283
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:52,970
you should probably just turn them over yeah i agree i mean
i think wolf is very good against them just play for punish

284
00:20:52,970 --> 00:21:03,910
pits matt plus if you play saying wolf you just watch the
pit spot man all right are you ready also like i was having

285
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,610
the hardest time in screams today he's gonna counter them
because like they play magic as well i've hit the point

286
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:21,690
where all the acts european accents blurred together so i
couldn't tell who was speaking it was so bad like i was so

287
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:30,510
bad like they all blurred together into oh yeah i'm ready
i'm ready we'll go wait speedily is the band captain by the

288
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:48,270
way so i don't know i did my job good fucking eye yeah yeah
job done did my captain job it's over now clocked out

289
00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:01,510
it was I was it was so hard like it was all like all the
accents actually blurred in the one and then why I knew it

290
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,730
was like you gotta turn me up because like you like I'm
trying to tell you stuff but you like you you're following

291
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:14,670
the wrong person I'm like I'm sorry I'm so sorry it's not
you

292
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,910
I'm so sorry

293
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:31,150
I followed the wrong guy because I thought it was him
talking or Winnie, okay

294
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:43,150
I was like, I didn't want to be like oh yeah, okay, I'll
turn, I didn't turn him up I just, it's literally, I it's

295
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:57,970
literally like I fucking hit the point where all their
access blur to get it to me so I was struggling all right

296
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:11,530
can you hear me yep good yeah I think we got this in the
back by the way I think so this one is mandatory I think we

297
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:25,590
got my own brain so stupid okay do we save PD then yes we
and i've been i'm feeling it i'm pulling the full screen

298
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:31,450
mode that's when you know i'm serious loki instead of mantis
i think so too actually but they're gonna go triple with

299
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:39,090
mantis for today it's interesting i don't think it was a
problem though for team captain team they just ban low-key

300
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:46,610
mag and phoenix oh but now we can't phoenix that's the
question do we just ban magic i think we've been lucky for

301
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:52,630
sure ban lucky here for sure i think okay that's in king
who's it's cooked.

302
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,370
Guys, I don't think Flats and Kingsmans are the scariest.

303
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,610
The scariest is nearly Terra.

304
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,710
And level one, Crook, he's gonna get his revenge.

305
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:10,630
He's gonna beat me up because of the last turn, but he's
like, finally finally in time.

306
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,870
After he was done beating up his next door neighbor, he's
gonna come for me now.

307
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,730
I think your last time, Envis, or That sounds creepy.

308
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,070
Do we save Mantis here?

309
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,330
Yeah, I think so.

310
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,790
We can play triple with, we can play, we can play triple
with.

311
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,410
It's like you're next.

312
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,390
I think it's either Mantis or Jeff.

313
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,970
I think Jeff would have.

314
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,850
You finished beating up my friend.

315
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,650
Now he's going to kick my ass.

316
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,770
But then I would play Mantis, Jeff and Cloak all three.

317
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:46,650
Yeah.

318
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,610
Maybe it's something against the Phoenix.

319
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,690
So it's which tank can defeat it?

320
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,470
Angela, I guess.

321
00:24:52,990 --> 00:25:03,230
okay this is perfect yeah i think so yeah i think so guy is
his friend it's his name

322
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:15,550
even he wasn't saying i think it's either mag or cap or
mentis i think you do mag because actually mentis might be

323
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:26,370
better they knew each other for like seven plus years and
even he was it safe and now i'm next i'm next wait you guys

324
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:32,130
don't want to play like die with triple support yeah all
right i don't know if triple support is like good but we

325
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:43,230
have a cool jeff open thing just do e-breed with three
support huh okay yeah like this what we have right now this

326
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:53,490
should be okay we could even play your friendship that
donkey yeah we can do that as well Hawkeye or Mantis guys?

327
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,370
I think Mantis first, if you don't work at it, we go normal.

328
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,010
Yeah, Mantis first and then go Hawkeye.

329
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,830
I don't think... I think we just stayed jet.

330
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,370
I think jet is really good.

331
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,250
Yeah, I think so too.

332
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,030
You have team up too.

333
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,890
It helps me see the darkness.

334
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,150
Can you destroy things all with Hawkeye?

335
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,530

508
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:05,470
we should we should try to play we should try to play a slow
flame though they're mantis all i go dashes i think we can

509
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:15,130
play aggro with my dashes are you fully upgraded first man
no not yet need a few more the gunner does so much i just

510
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:24,910
need to play for gunner all the time try to try to take
damage you guys here if you trust me they have phoenix ult

511
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:35,500
i'm pretty sure no they use phoenix i think they might go
cap instead of randula

512
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,860
maybe they go grude i think but we can just one shot the
grude every e cycle just play for my e and play you want to

513
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,220
play left go i think we go mid and try to build our I go
right side.

514
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,500
I go right side.

515
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,500
I'm playing front to back this first fight.

516
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,000
Engie Main.

517
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:55,540

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,940

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,160

00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,140

You boost us by Maxi?

528
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
I'm coming back.

529
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,080
I'm gonna walk, I'm gonna walk.

530
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,320
Yeah, yeah.

531
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,780
Engie won.

532
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,080

534
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:21,940

And help me, help me, help me, help me, help me.

540
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:31,980
They have no link.

541
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,820
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

542
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm dead.

543
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,600
Yeah, I'm dead.

544
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,620
In this one, in this one, in this one, in this one.

545
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,340
He's dead, I'm dead.

546
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:40,520
I'm gonna race.

547
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm gonna race.

548
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,080
Yeah, yeah.

549
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,080
I need help, I need help.

550
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,340
I need help.

551
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,640
I need help.

552
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,500
I got two supports.

553
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,360
Oh, I'm dead.

554
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,860
Go next fight, I think.

555
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,480
Go next fight.

556
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,180
We lost that fight.

557
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,420
Please keep me more up.

558
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,540
I don't know how to say it otherwise.

559
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,820
You need to walk forward a bit more.

560
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,600
We have three supports.

561
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,240
We shouldn't be this afraid to walk.

562
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,660
We just need to walk more.

563
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,160
It's fine.

564
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,740
What they used there?

565
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,160
Res, Enix.

566
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,360
Go left side, actually.

567
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,320
Go left side, I think.

568
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,860
Be careful of the...

569
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,780
GP's not up, or no?

570
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,380
Oh, we can't.

571
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:06,860
Yeah, we can't.

572
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,280
We can't.

573
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,840
Then just wait.

574
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,600
I think we just walked in.

575
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,500
I think we just walked in.

576
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,360
Can we kill the Mantis through?

577
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,120
I don't think we can.

578
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,480
I'll use my ult.

579
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,020
I'll use my ult.

580
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:17,760
I'm gonna go.

581
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,600
I'm gonna go on Phoenix.

582
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,280
I'm gonna jump on Phoenix.

583
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,080
I'm gonna jump on Phoenix.

584
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,160

I'll match this if I need to.

592
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,160

I can't even touch you.

I got it.

635
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,540
I've got it.

636
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,940
I forced the invis.

637
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,920
In this left, in this left.

638
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,160
I die point, I die points.

639
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm dying point, I'm dying point.

640
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,660
We might need to TP.

641
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,480
Do we TP?

642
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,580
No, no, no, no.

643
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,100
We only need to.

644
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,300
I think we need to.

645
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:20,900
I think we need to.

646
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,600
I think we need to.

647
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,560
They can mantis, they can.

648
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,880
Someone else can you do it?

649
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,280
Can you do it?

650
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,860
I think we're good.

651
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,200
Okay.

652
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,100
Okay, I'll do it.

653
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,500
It's fine, it's fine.

654
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,180
They have tanks.

655
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,780
Come, come, come, come.

656
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,500
We need to farm real though.

657
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,240
We need to farm real tight.

658
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,480
TP their side on their tree.

659
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,220
Just TP in the point and we just farm with Cloak ult.

660
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,080
Go, go, go, go.

661
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,720
On the...

662
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,040
Okay, okay, okay.

663
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,320
I just got it.

664
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:55,780
It's fine.

665
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,040
It's fine.

666
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,940
We have it for the next round.

667
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,780
Adam 1.

668
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,420
Adam 1.

669
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,020
I need to be out.

670
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,720
Do you know how to support stuff?

671
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,340
DRP 1.

672
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,860
DRP is 1.

673
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:15,940
point i'm coming i'm coming i'm one i'm one i'm one i have
old we have no heals uh no here uh when he is here i live i

674
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:22,320

can't strange you can all in first max because you're ahead

675
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:30,580

676
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:40,240
what do i mean they have that i only have envy i'm pretty
sure yeah they only have imbs and torch i only have I think

677
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,620
I keep strange for me.

678
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,400
I think so too.

679
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,340
I think we'll just press double into them, we look cool and
then look for strange.

680
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,180
Trust me, can you try to bait out their Invispush maybe?

681
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,640
Or no?

682
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,760
Yeah, it's very risky for me to play.

683
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,620
I just die.

684
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,560
I need a little bit more resource, I think.

685
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,920
Like they just like Angela grabbed me in and I just instead
I only have 500 HP and Terra is not bad at the game.

686
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,680
So he hits a lot of shots on me.

687
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,740
collectively, I think.

688
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,020
Yeah, we split up a lot.

689
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,160
If we damage boost here, we push Terra first fight, then we
just win.

690
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,120
Should we just play Loki at a point?

691
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,040
I was like, I don't know.

692
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,560
No, no, no.

693
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,240
I think this is fine.

694
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,520
We don't have it as well, I think.

695
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,800
I feel like we're split up.

696
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,320
I think what we have right now is fine.

697
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,380
Yeah.

698
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,800

Yeah.

701
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,440
Because they can't really contest.

702
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,980
We can go to the cloak.

703
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,900

thinking

863
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:21,830
a good class captain follows or an exact i'm such a good
captain guys I'm such a good puppet leader.

864
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,230
That's honestly probably gonna be the band of the
tournament.

865
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,530
That shit is OP.

866
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,630
Save magic maybe?

867
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,890
If the magic save, we ban Phoenix, I guess.

868
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:41,430
Okay.

869
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,010
Okay.

870
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:42,770
I guess.

871
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,010
Just do low key magic.

872
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:44,910
Low key magic?

873
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:45,550
Yeah.

874
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:46,570
No, my cloak.

875
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,310
My cloak.

876
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,370
Guys, I got target bed!

877
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,190
Yeah!

878
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,450
No!

879
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,450
No, I got target bed!

880
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,210
No!

881
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,230
How did they know I'm only good at Cloak?

882
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,610
Crook hates playing Cloak, by the way.

883
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:02,530
They will not play Cloak.

884
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,410
That's a good part.

885
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,690
Every other team will play Cloak.

886
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,510
One of the other, wouldn't like his teammate play Cloak?

887
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:09,330
Grovo?

888
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,150
I don't think Grovo plays Cloak, no?

889
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,370
I don't think I've ever seen Grovo play Cloak either.

890
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,850
I don't think both of them play Cloak.

891
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,270
They don't have a Cloak player.

892
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:18,230
That's kind of crazy.

893
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,170
How did they know?

894
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:21,850
Yeah!

895
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:22,730
Oh no!

896
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:33,170
yay wait no they might just go Adam on this map to be honest
we could think about banning it what did we last been last

897
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:43,290
time Mac Mac I couldn't like the mag ban that was the only
way I could live from time before it made sense I think Adam

898
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:54,430
ban or mantis ban makes more sense I think mantis I don't
want to give terror damage boost and I'm gonna save this

899
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:59,170
hero Oh, I mean, we gotta go Groot, he said play Sing as
well.

900
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,250
No, I think it's fine.

901
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,190
I really think if they go Thing, I just go Deadpool and I
just headshot everyone.

902
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:05,110
They're just all done.

903
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,310
I can go Groot, I think.

904
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:06,830
I just trust it.

905
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:07,470
Oh, that, yeah.

906
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,290
We can go...

907
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,290
If they go Groot, in example, we can go Thing and Deadpool
and we can just shoot them.

908
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:16,990
They gave us Mantis again.

909
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:18,770
I trust the goal.

910
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,510
We're looking at final boss comp if we go Groot, Mantis.

911
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:22,590
I think so, yeah.

912
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:23,630
I think so.

913
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:36,050
spawn hole we might go dive uh what with what dps i think dd
and uh why can't you play moxie as dive i guess i think we

914
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:49,030
just go i think we just go can we not just go full dive
moxie and we just like full one what does that mean are you

915
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:57,570
sure that we have mantis yeah we do have mantis isn't triple
support better play triple by multi-state that's what we

916
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:02,750
that's what we played last month i think yeah we did pretty
good with triples they're gonna be on thing now i think

917
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:11,990
they're gonna i think if they spawn a whole i go i don't
know we go for life yeah i think so we go shower let's think

918
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:18,570
maybe are you sure we have i think we can play i think you
can play mantis jeff uh mantis jeff rocket like this i think

919
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:26,730
so i think so too like this i think it was the school and
everything but what is the Can we play this if there's a

920
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:27,470
train tank for support?

921
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,190
I want to play to take the high run.

922
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,510
I see thing, I see thing.

923
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,830
Yeah, they are.

924
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,050
Yeah, yeah, spawn holders.

925
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:38,730
I'm gonna flank.

926
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:39,850
Take the high, take the high.

927
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:40,750
Can you double damage me?

928
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:41,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, double.

929
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:43,650

00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:16,910
Kill him.

1095
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:17,370
Kill him.

1096
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:17,630
Kill him.

1097
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:18,130
Okay.

1098
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,310

I'll go.

1106
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,110
They have cap pill though.

1107
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:33,810
I think.

1108
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,010
They have no...

1109
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:35,210
Yeah.

1110
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:36,830
They go Unison.

1111
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,790
They have no spores other than cap pill.

1112
00:57:40,870 --> 00:58:13,150
I think we can go with raccoon maybe Look, look for us!

1113
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:14,270
What?

1114
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:14,410

1115
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,710
Killed, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

1116
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:35,090
I'm gonna solve now, I bet that's what you got, don't you.

1117
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,090
It's open, it's open.

1118
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:39,470
Yeah, I start, I start.

1119
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:41,190
It's okay.

1120
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,010
Go next round.

1121
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:42,470
It's okay.

1122
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:43,110
Yeah.

1123
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,330
It's a tough situation.

1124
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:46,250
We can't really...

1125
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,750
It's fucking cloak, bro.

1126
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:48,530
It's just cloak.

1127
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,330
Like, it's just...

1128
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,130
Like, it's just so broken.

1129
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,550
I thought Karuba played good.

1130
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,270
That's what I was like.

1131
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,870
I'm pretty sure they have a cloak there.

1132
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:59,510
Oh my god, bro.

1133
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,710
And they're playing three tank clog.

1134
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,130
They're just farming it every second.

1135
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:02,770
Yeah, I know.

1136
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:03,910
It's just so stupid.

1137
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,330
And they just spawn hold here.

1138
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,330
They could, like, really good counter spawn hold.

1139
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:08,290
Yeah.

1140
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:09,150
Uh, yeah.

00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:10,410

Yeah.

1150
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,410
We don't really have Link or anything.

1151
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:53,210
Can we hold the room?

1152
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,090

00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:55,370

That's fine, no?

01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:01,330
Yeah.

1161
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,070
There's a lot of players.

1162
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:04,590
Why do we hold?

1163
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:05,910
The first tank would...

1164
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,410
Wait, how do I hold here?

1165
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:08,370

01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,410
I can kill him.

1213
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:09,470
I got you, I got you.

1214
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:10,550
Did you do TP?

1215
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:11,550
UTP, UTP survivors.

1216
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:14,870
MAC, MAC, MAC, MAC, MAC, MAC, Mac, MAC, MAC.

1217
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:16,770
MAC, MAC, MAC, MAC, MAC, MAC.

1218
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,050
Come back, come back.

1219
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:18,230
Alright.

1220
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:19,430
Nice.

1221
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:23,110
They only have one more.

1222
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:23,430
Fresh wall.

1223
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:23,790
Fresh wall.

1224
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:24,430
Fresh wall.

1225
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:25,310
No, Polish shoe.

1226
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1227
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:30,170
Oh, Angela.

1228
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,390
They slow, they slow.

1229
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:33,810
I want to help her.

1230
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:34,290
I'm playing her.

1231
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,310
I can kill, I can kill the green Moonlight.

1232
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:38,750
Ready?

1233
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:40,370
I'm careful.

1234
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:40,890
I Guys, I touched, I touched.

1235
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:41,050
I touched.

1236
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,630
Hide!

1237
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:42,430
I'm just watching.

1238
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,590
I'm cutting it back.

1239
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,110
Okie, I'm cutting it back.

1240
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,210
He didn't hit me.

1241
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:48,590
He didn't hit me.

1242
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:48,870
I'm fine.

1243
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:49,690
I'm going to attack her.

1244
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:50,010
I'll TP.

1245
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,290
Better get out.

1246
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:56,690
I'm TPing.

1247
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,170
I'm TPing.

1248
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,330
Yeah, yeah, I'm leaving.

1249
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:58,710
I'm leaving.

1250
01:01:59,230 --> 01:01:59,370
I'm leaving.

1251
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:00,530
Come on.

1252
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:00,670
Okay.

1253
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,150
Everyone live.

1254
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:02,970
Everyone just take it.

1255
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:04,170
Go behind.

1256
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:04,510
Go behind.

1257
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,170
The card's on the left here, Priya.

1258
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,730
No in the shield!

1259
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,330
Wait, 2-2-2-1!

1260
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:14,230
2-1-2-1!

1261
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:15,610
Okay, chill, 2-2-2.

1262
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:17,750
Oh, I can kill you, Welfare.

1263
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:20,750
And they're hiding, hiding, hiding, hiding, hiding.

1264
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:22,370
I'm hiding, I'm hiding.

1265
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:23,850
Why can't I hide?

1266
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:25,070
I'm probably dead.

1267
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,170
I'll kill him, I kill him.

1268
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:31,930
Oh, they're all one.

1269
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:34,470
It's okay.

1270
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,210
I'm going back, Dood.

1271
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:39,810
We need to go dive.

1272
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,390
Do I stay in this?

1273
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:42,890
You can fold.

1274
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,310
That's good.

1275
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:45,190
Swabbing.

1276
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,090
Yeah, Phoenix is good.

1277
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,150
No, Phoenix is not good.

1278
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,130
Go Hawkeye or something.

1279
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:49,210
Or Wolf.

1280
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:49,750
Say Wolf.

1281
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:50,550
Wolf is good.

1282
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:52,950
Is the wolf walking my main?

1283
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:53,770
Just stop that vehicle.

1284
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:55,690
Just wait.

1285
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:55,870
Just wait.

1286
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:56,570
Can we stop the car right now?

1287
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:57,530
Can we stop the car right now?

1288
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:58,150
Yeah.

1289
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:58,890
We'll pull up.

1290
01:02:59,150 --> 01:02:59,650
We'll pull up you guys.

1291
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:01,130
Yeah, he's there.

1292
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:01,830
We're getting here.

1293
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:02,410
I'm about to go back then.

1294
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:02,970
I'm about to go back then.

1295
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:03,670
There's like five cars.

1296
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:04,170
Yeah, I go.

1297
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:04,450
Ready?

1298
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,990
Three, two, one.

1299
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,490
One.

1300
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,530
Come on, Injury, Injury, Injury, Injury, injury, injury!

1301
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,330
Yeah, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

1302
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,270
Yeah, shoot!

1303
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:16,890
Oh, probably bad.

1304
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,750
Oh, crap.

1305
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:22,250
Oh, crap.

1306
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,210
Win the bullets, win the bullets, win the bullets.

1307
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:23,670
Can you TP?

1308
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:24,610
Yeah, yeah, solid card.

1309
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:25,150
No, we don't have TP.

1310
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,810
I just need a slow card.

1311
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,170
I can nil maybe, uh, Winnie, and we combo.

1312
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:30,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1313
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,950
Touch with the...

1314
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:34,930
Make sure to get cloak, because now she's gonna face
everyone.

1315
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:37,010
Just go, I think you can go now.

1316
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,490
I'm dead.

1317
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:40,690
No, no, I'm gonna go now.

1318
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,190
You wanna go now?

1319
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:41,550
Go now?

1320
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:41,730
Go now?

1321
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:42,090
Yeah, yeah.

1322
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,690
Wait, no, no, no, no.

1323
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,310
I can't, but I got three, I think.

1324
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:46,930
Disappear!

1325
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:48,250
Yeah, let's see what to do.

1326
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:48,430
What?

1327
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:49,250
Peace.

1328
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:54,470
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, yeah, but I'm dying from one
point.

1329
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:55,310
Do you have anything?

1330
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:55,730
I'm dead.

1331
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:57,810
No, I'm dead here.

1332
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:01,010
I think we really need a bad close.

1333
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,170
Yeah.

1334
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:02,650
Yeah.

1335
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:02,890
Yeah.

1336
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:03,090
Yeah.

1337
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:03,270
Yeah.

1338
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,090
Yeah.

1339
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:04,550
Yeah.

1340
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:05,970
Yeah.

1341
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:12,410
It's like if I do damage, they just can't cloak over it.

1342
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:14,210
If I don't do damage, they can't play the game.

1343
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:15,910
It's like, I don't know what to do.

1344
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:18,950
And we just consistently lose the cloak every time.

1345
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:23,450
I mean, there's a reason they banned cloak.

1346
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:24,170
It's just OP.

1347
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:26,230
I guess.

1348
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:32,290
What do we do last save cloak?

1349
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,190
What do we do then?

1350
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,290
Back to crime.

1351
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:38,050
I think we just banned, we just banned cloak instead of
Loki.

1352
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:46,670
but it wasn't my fault i think i played very well this time
yeah we just not instead of mentis we just ban do we do we

1353
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:54,310
need to give loki i think i played really well i don't i
don't think it was my fault i mean crook is good with it

1354
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:59,390
maybe not yeah this time not my fault yeah

1355
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,430
i still cry

1356
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:22,330
I sound like that puffer fish where you give him a cure and
he's like I feel like we can still play I read with okay I

1357
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:33,690
think I played a lot better than yesterday you know that
puffer fish where you're like yeah I think the map was just

1358
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:43,110
really hard for us yeah but Mac mandatory it's either Mac or
cloak last I think yeah I think do that i think i think

1359
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:48,290
cloak needs to be banned in the middle i think it's just
like legit ob but how do we ban it then you didn't save it

1360
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:56,530
though i mean how do we ban it uh speedily if they we have
to like unban we have to give loki is that fine i i would

1361
01:05:56,530 --> 01:06:03,630
rather play against the loki than the cloak like i think
loki is too much i mean especially we're gonna play against

1362
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:13,350
like we've dive which will instantly like one should look
you know oh my god they added five five on dive it's like

1363
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:20,750
they they just stack in the bubble that's crazy dive doesn't
kill anything they listened they actually added five you can

1364
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:26,770
force out lamps and it's not like they're gonna have a 15
second rank like after we don't yeah also where the is this

1365
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:33,430
is this do we pick convergence pick the convergence map do
we have to pick convergence can we not pick yeah i think we

1366
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,510
No, you have to pick Convergence.

1367
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,430
What the fuck?

1368
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:38,510
This is Snowbreak?

1369
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:40,250
What the fuck is this?

1370
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,490
Is this the newest update?

1371
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,070
Like, they're discussing strats, and I'm looking at
Snowbreak right now.

1372
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,110
I'm looking at...

1373
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:48,970
I'm scrolling...

1374
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:50,270
I'm doom-scrolling Twitter.

1375
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:51,370
Look at this.

1376
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:52,950
They had a new update on Snowbreak.

1377
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:54,570
Yeah, we pick Convergence.

1378
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:59,270
Yeah, where they fucking beat up a slot machine with their
ass.

1379
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,210
Oh, jolly, is there another one?

1380
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,010
I think so.

1381
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:04,290
That's crazy.

1382
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:12,150
It's like the best dive map.

1383
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:13,450
We can try all of the chala.

1384
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,730
I think that's good for us.

1385
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,290
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1386
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,210
I feel like it's gonna be like a hellah.

1387
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,230
Terra's gonna go hellah.

1388
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:22,610
We can't go that.

1389
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:23,250
We can't go that.

1390
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:24,530
What else is there?

1391
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:25,710
Symbiotic.

1392
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:26,490
Symbiotic.

1393
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:27,070
Yeah.

1394
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,470
Wait, can we go the vampire map?

1395
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:30,750
The central part?

1396
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,450
Oh, central part.

1397
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,450
Yeah, that is a good idea.

1398
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:34,450
Let's go central then.

1399
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:34,930
There you go.

1400
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:43,450
go central the that's the speedily classic map speedily
never loses on that map yeah wait but we but didn't we lost

1401
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:50,770
on that map yesterday no but that's not fair speedily on
torch never loses whatever it doesn't doesn't count yeah

1402
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:59,630
speedily on torch doesn't lose there i was like wait a
minute i think we didn't we lose on that map wait a minute

1403
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:06,870
that's not true i could try it did the impossible We lost on
that map.

1404
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,410
Did you just play triple support or children?

1405
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,530
Oh, Macapair's Iron Lung just came out.

1406
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:15,290
I think it's like...

1407
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,510
You need a second DPS nowadays with Torch?

1408
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:19,510
Yeah, I think so.

1409
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:23,670
Was it good?

1410
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,810
Was it good or bad?

1411
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:47,410
Okay, as a very good viewer rating?

1412
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:54,570
Okay, but how many of those viewers are markiplier fans
that's the thing i mean it's either we ban maglas or cloak

1413
01:08:54,570 --> 01:09:04,550
depending on which one they save no yeah i think so uh
blessing like is it that's the thing because sometimes like

1414
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:11,610
viewers would just like just go straight for good and we
glaze it up what's the word would just like hype it up but

1415
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:25,240
it's like not as good as they say it's slow but i really
liked it i feel like really slow isn't it iron run isn't it

1416
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:34,700
based off of that movie that the game where you're in that
fucking submarine thing yeah I'm typing R okay we got this

1417
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:47,710
yeah yeah I remember the game itself is like super slow in
general so so like I'm not surprised like maybe they're just

1418
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:56,090
trying to be but then like I'm I hate slow burn though I'm
really bad at slow burn I just want to go you guys want to

1419
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:58,810
go if they give us all right let's see draft first

1420
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:13,850
i'm i know snowburn is good for horror but i i don't know
what i mean i don't need snowburn overall it doesn't matter

1421
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:22,110
what john does it matter oh yeah you guys want to know what
it looks like when i'm afk admin safety yeah we will win it

1422
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:40,310
problem is they might just say i mean like play for clock
kills in attack that's why i think that's why i want to ban

1423
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:50,410
it like i mean we can just play gruten whenever they want to
kill him but the loki i think loki no i said i think so too

1424
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:56,190
we can't give loki and mantis i'm fine giving mantis but i
can yeah they're gonna have loki mantis too i mean yeah

1425
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:56,970
That's fine.

1426
01:10:57,070 --> 01:10:59,730
Which heroes will get my cosmic favor today?

1427
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,290
But I feel like that's fine if they do that.

1428
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:05,130
We just go mag, wall them, and they're kind of cooked.

1429
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:06,830
Aero is also kind of asleep.

1430
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:09,330
He hasn't cooked as much as he normally does, I think.

1431
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:10,830
We can use it to our advantage.

1432
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:12,810
Are we gonna ban cloak?

1433
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:15,010
No, we're gonna ban magic.

1434
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,490
Ban magic and I think last ban mag.

1435
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:18,530
I think so.

1436
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:18,890
Then we win.

1437
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:20,190
Micro cloak, macro cloak.

1438
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,270
Wait, are we actually banning magic?

1439
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:23,610
Yeah.

1440
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:23,990
Yeah.

1441
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:24,990
But...

1442
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:37,790
I think on defense, I think on defense we can play all the
yeah, I was gonna say I don't think Kingsman has that I

1443
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:44,950
don't think he's allowed to play magic anymore because his
team prohibited him.

1444
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,370
I don't think you should have saved Mike, no?

1445
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:56,350
No, because like apparently Terra and Crimso was like
telling him not to play magic.

1446
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,110
I don't want to play against the cloak.

1447
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:03,170
That's why I was like, there was like, like Terra and Crimso
were doing bot reviews with Kingsman.

1448
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:06,350
And he was like, we're not playing magic.

1449
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:12,010
And then, like, because like, apparently he was doing, he,
in the team environment, he was not.

1450
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:13,470
That's why I was so confused.

1451
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,230
I was like, wait, but I was so confused.

1452
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,470
Why are we banning magic?

1453
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:22,150
No, the thing is they were losing because Kingsman was on
magic and then Terra.

1454
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:27,510
And then, like, apparently there was like slight, there was
like a slight argument between Terra and Kingsman last night

1455
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,830
where like Tara was like, don't, you're not allowed, you
can't play.

1456
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:31,390
Do you not?

1457
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:32,350
No!

1458
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:34,750
I thought we were planning cook.

1459
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:36,330
What happened?

1460
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,710
Do we not just play Hawkeye Groot?

1461
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:46,830
And if they try to farm an ult, we just like, why do we
always change our plans?

1462
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,390
Well, we don't have Mantis.

1463
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,590
We don't have Turbine.

1464
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:51,270
We can still be.

1465
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:53,110
I mean, I mean, I can go Mantis.

1466
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,170
Oh, no, no, no, it's banned.

1467
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:54,910
You freak.

1468
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:59,750
Invis Cloak as well.

1469
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:00,810
Invis Rocket then.

1470
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:01,890
Cloak is bad.

1471
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:04,070
Yeah, Invis Rocket is fine.

1472
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:05,150
I think we should Jeff Rocket.

1473
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:06,530
It's not my fault.

1474
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,550
It was my team doing bad bans.

1475
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:09,630
You don't think so?

1476
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,190
Oh, we're defense.

1477
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,610
Yeah, but I thought we were going to ban...

1478
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:14,810
That's why I was like, we should ban Cloak.

1479
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:16,090
Why are we...

1480
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:19,010
That's why I was like, we should ban Cloak instead of Magic.

1481
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,130
I think Raccoon, though.

1482
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,270
I think I'm going to win this.

1483
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,930
This bad Cloak doesn't ban Cloak.

1484
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:32,090
actually really tilted me if they try like i'm we kept
saying every time we lose they play club but i felt like

01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,010
Okay, I see guys, see, I knew it.

My opinion was wrong.

01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:22,770
See guys, I didn't know what I was talking about when I was
like, I'm still, let's see, that they didn't ban club.

Look at that.

1604
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:25,350

Yep.

1685
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:04,590

1686
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:05,230
Yeah.

1687
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,270

This would just not happen.

1696
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:23,770
You need an eye.

01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:28,210
I'm jumping out walls.

1700
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,490

We did it.

1707
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:52,710

It's the same thing with Metro.

1721
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:23,490
Moxie was a little bit better.

1722
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:26,490
Oh, maybe a little bit more.

1723
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,550
I'm just happy.

1724
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,310
I'm just happy.

1725
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:30,370
We're not last.

1726
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:31,750
That was like my goal.

1727
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:33,330
46 maybe, but that was like...

1728
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:35,610
Like me, like me, like...

1729
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,090
Wait, wait, do I hug?

1730
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:37,870
You mean?

1731
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:38,270
Yes.

1732
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:39,690
I was like, what does that mean?

1733
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:42,550
You are me.

1734
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:43,310
Yes.

1735
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:44,690
What?

1736
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:52,410
I'm just like, what does yes mean?

1737
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:58,570
I was panicking because I was like, what do you mean, yeah?

1738
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:10,360
I was like freaking out because everyone else was like, all
right, here's the plan.

1739
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,160
And I'm like, wait, I still don't know whose own thing
first.

1740
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,160
Not last.

1741
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:17,420
Not.

1742
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:23,910
Someone said to me, Moxie, Hawkeye, respect.

1743
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:28,130
Oh my God.

1744
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:29,290
Wait, then you got it.

Yeah, why is she good now?

1758
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:11,270
It was close to somehow, but I mean, all right.

1759
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,030
Terror is crashing off bad.

1760
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:14,870
Oh, shit.

1761
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,730
That's crazy.

1762
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:17,250
We just need to stop comp.

1763
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:17,870
We never.

1764
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:19,950
What the fuck?

1765
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,590
What's the standing now?

1766
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:24,250
We're not last.

1767
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:25,250
We're not last point.

1768
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,950
We're six or seven.

1769
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,210
We're six or seven.

1770
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:39,550
and ironically we're sixth place or seventh place if we
right now at this current moment if we win the next game

1771
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:51,750
we're we're fifth or six yeah yeah i've carried oh my god
kingsman is wait no you go first i was saying like if it's e

1772
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:58,630
if it's if next match is eu is it going to be aids like i
don't know no it's forced on an a it's forced on an a no but

1773
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,090
uh They'll do balance latency if the other team doesn't
agree.

1774
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:03,870
Oh, yes.

1775
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:04,570
Oh, my God.

1776
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,710
Kingsman's apparently being God-reviewed right now.

1777
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:09,070
Everyone should be on ping then, if that's the case.

1778
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:10,010
Maybe it's more playable.

1779
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,220
Wait, let's see.

1780
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:22,180
I'm going to check what Terra's chat said when he hit a 0-5.

1781
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,080
Can I look at how they lost a map against...

1782
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:25,880
Where's Terra?

1783
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:26,660
Aramari's team.

1784
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,560
Because I think it's the only map they dropped in the whole
tourney.

1785
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,120
Yeah, they were...

1786
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,480
I thought, yeah, their team is really strong, isn't it?

1787
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:43,420
it j like j3's team yeah yeah yeah like what comp did they
play maybe they figure it out the comp i can i can send you

1788
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:53,000
the the replay code their their dps are gale and j3 i think
that's pretty sus hero pool but isn't the the replay code

1789
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:02,440
the team chat if you want to watch it no tarot doesn't have
vods on i mean i have vod replay even when i have the

1790
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:08,200
plug-in where you you hide your vase you can still replay it
but there's no chat so i can't i literally cannot see what

1791
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:14,740
chat says i'm so sad i'm so sad he actually doesn't have
chat and like he doesn't have it

1792
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:28,540
enabled they didn't they didn't play cloak even though they
had it open they played raccoon in this oh

1793
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:46,930
no last team are fighting guys yeah i know i was watching a
little bit of that fighting i'm watching all of that oh my

1794
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,730
god tara versus kingsman

1795
01:28:54,170 --> 01:29:01,630
are fighting right now because tara's doing a vod review on
kingsman and kingsman is like is like not taking the

1796
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:10,790
criticism very well no right yeah and and then like they're
like there's like chat rating chat hoppers going in between

1797
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:15,670
the two chats you criticize the king No.

1798
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:20,610
Well, they have two kings on their team.

1799
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:22,910
You need to strike for the king.

1800
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,930
You better aim for the head.

1801
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:28,930
Ash, it's cold, bro.

1802
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:30,190
I got chills.

1803
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:32,090
That edit goes hard.

1804
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:33,790
I want an edit like that.

1805
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:35,570
That's a hard ass edit.

1806
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:40,190
But they're saying kings flat.

1807
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:41,310
What did the flat say?

1808
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:45,270
I think maybe he calmed the situation.

1809
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:55,070
situation be like guys stop fighting guys we're all a team i
mean they didn't lose yet yeah but i think he's just mad

1810
01:29:55,070 --> 01:30:06,370
that he had an 05 stat i think i think terry's always a bit
uh he's passionate he's passionate like from what i'm

1811
01:30:06,370 --> 01:30:13,010
hearing and from what i'm seeing terry has a point i mean i
think he's he has a point i'm pretty sure yeah yeah but

1812
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:18,690
terry is always like that hell is trying to help i don't
think it means uh bad thing yeah but he's also like me you

1813
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:25,250
know he's super blunt and aggressive yeah yeah i think i
think i'm like that too to be honest i can't he was just

1814
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:42,520
german it's just oh like that's how it works that's how it
works i don't think he knows that like german people have a

1815
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:51,280
way of being very blunt and real he's like really because
like i think it's like i think like for europeans it's like

1816
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:59,300
dutch and germans are very blunt and direct when they're
talking crook is chill he's angry or is he just german

1817
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:11,380
that's what you think sorry he's so chill yeah yeah very
chill it's crazy has that thing about him it's fine i'm the

1818
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:21,580
oldest okay you have right girl at least toilet for eight
hours though and he just doesn't is he wait i'm gonna in the

1819
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:31,640
bootcamp he did that he was jerking off in the shower for
four hours he said he was sick but i didn't believe him he

1820
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:36,900
was definitely getting a few loads out to um to relax

1821
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:50,860
damn i'm listening i'm listening right now to the drama wait
what were they saying yeah he's doing a general speech he's

1822
01:31:50,860 --> 01:32:03,060
making the team more or else go up oh good for him well he
asked you as a team captain yeah because like then they'll

1823
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:10,740
start exploding oh he's right bro terra is getting insanely
rich like the problem is also this is like the same thing

1824
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:22,760
that i told you yesterday uh jerky uh jerky dokey oh my god
like everyone in chat has infinite suggestions everyone has

1825
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:31,860
and they're all right and they're all boss everyone in chat
is worse than terror everyone in chat is worse than me

1826
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:37,920
everyone doesn't understand what's going on we try to make
suggestions it is hard you know especially when you're

1827
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:48,120
losing but bro it is extremely tilting to have dms people
dming me try this try that like okay I mean, great.

1828
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,220
This is like so annoying.

1829
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,080
And it's the same for Terra.

1830
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:53,020
Like he reads infinite suggestions.

1831
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,680
At this point, it's better to turn off Twitch chat and just
play.

1832
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,900
And it's the same for everyone else, right?

1833
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:03,880
And then you have five people on your team, cook up all
different suggestions, and then everyone just all over the

1834
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:04,080
place.

1835
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,000
At that point, everyone just plays for themselves and it's
not a team anymore.

1836
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,440
That's how it always is.

1837
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,680
That's why you need like two people that you can listen to
and then it's fine.

1838
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,640
And who are these two people?

1839
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,480
I mean, in Terra's team, it should be Terra and Krook, for
sure.

1840
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:19,860
Yeah.

1841
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:22,840
Wait, has Krook talked in the game?

1842
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,460
Speeds and Vinny also has good suggestions.

1843
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:26,880
What?

1844
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:30,780
Has Krook helped out in the argument?

1845
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,560
Because everyone's, like, against Terra right now.

1846
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:34,860
Yeah, no.

1847
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,760
Krook is always holding back.

1848
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:40,700
If he lets it, if he lets the beast out, it'll be bad.

1849
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:45,480
He does greenlight a lot of things, which I told him he
needs to get better at not doing that.

1850
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:52,580
back then when we when we were screaming for words i think
crook was like always greenlighting the bands and then

1851
01:33:52,580 --> 01:34:00,660
afterwards he complained about the bands he's like he lets
his rage build yeah i mean it is what it is you know

1852
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:10,720
especially if you play eight hours a day you know he's just
gotta let the beast out he's got he's gotta let it out

1853
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:21,780
let the devil out very similar to me you know i try to also
not crash out but of course things annoy me you know if we

1854
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:27,080
if i think we have a good matchup and we're losing you know
i try to make something different maybe make the matchup

1855
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:34,240
better but it's very hard to do that so it's like bro it's
not always working out i feel bad for bogey he was like guys

1856
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,560
don't start any drama

1857
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:45,240
I mean, it's as I said, like Kingsman was the pro in the
last tournament.

1858
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:51,900
As hard as it sounds, he was in the content creator
tournament where they were like mostly lower rated players.

1859
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:53,620
No, he was the pro in that tournament.

1860
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,800
And now it's just not the case anymore.

1861
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,740
So it's just like not drama, though.

1862
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,880
Like it happens in every team environment.

1863
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:08,380
Like if you ever watch like those like, yeah, but the thing
is videos of like teams and their comms, like it's just on

1864
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:08,680
everything.

1865
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,040
Yeah.

1866
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:13,020
But the thing is, there's a lot of people watching,
especially on Kingsman Stream.

1867
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:17,940
So it could eventually lead to drama only because of the
chat itself causing it.

1868
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:19,840
Yeah, they're just like...

1869
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,200
That's just exactly what I said.

1870
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,840
That's just casuals and boss, right?

1871
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,440
They're just like full casuals.

1872
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,300
Yeah, they've never been in an environment like this.

1873
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,280
They've never been at the top.

1874
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:29,040
They don't know what it's like.

1875
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,240
Yeah, they might twist it into drama because they came from
drama.

1876
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,940
Of course, there's a reputation that we want to have, right?

1877
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:36,540
We want to uphold.

1878
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:37,140
We want to win.

1879
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:39,020
We don't earn a lot of money, 6K.

1880
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:46,820
a month is a lot you know of course people are passionate
makes sense of course in a streamer tournament like this you

1881
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:54,180
can say it's different but for to think like this there
needs to be way less money on the line like the j yeah 50k

1882
01:35:54,180 --> 01:36:00,580
50k is a lot it's a bit too much in my opinion for the money
compared to the i mean only the top four teams are earning

1883
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:07,300
in in rivals and not even that well like yeah if i win this
tournament and we get first place i get 6k that's like

1884
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:16,340
almost two times my salary what really a month trade trade
first place is 6k is it free no it's not i think it's it's

1885
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:28,920
18s there's 18s so no maybe not maybe it's like 22 it's like
22 by six which is wait are you euros euros or a us i get us

1886
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:36,780
dollars from navy okay i get i get i use euros in germany so
it's like yeah i it's like worse for me so it's like three

1887
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:44,900
three k a month that's what i'm saying wait so it's 3k a
month i didn't say that i can't say the exact number oh wait

1888
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:52,980
but you said double it's double your salary i'm saying it's
not a lot like people always think pro plays earn so much

1889
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:59,240
but it's just wrong i think it's like i think if you're in i
think only if you're in like valorant maybe and you're like

1890
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:05,560
the top the top the top there's like five esports that make
like a ton of money i would say it's like i would say it's

1891
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:14,500
like cs Valorant like League Dota League yeah and like maybe
like fortnight like I don't think fortnight I think

1892
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:22,520
fortnight is only as a shit ton of money I think like only
as a content creator if you if you're on the top of

1893
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:29,720
fortnight you make so much money I'm telling you like yeah
he that bought an example he has a 20k contract a month for

1894
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:38,100
sure yeah but he's the best and there's a lot of yeah I
mean, if you look at, like, most top Fortnite players, like,

1895
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,560
earnings, it's like, it's, they make a lot.

1896
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,760
I mean, Jockey, Jockey was a good Fortnite player, right?

1897
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:47,140
And he said he made, like, with contract, he made, like, 7K
a month, which is so, so crazy, right?

1898
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,660
I think, Honor of Kings as well.

1899
01:37:51,660 --> 01:37:52,240
It's, like, lol.

1900
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:55,960
I'm, like, so crazy as in, like, a lot or a little?

1901
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:04,900
Because I feel like, 7K a month grinding video, like,
grinding, like, 10-plus hours a day.

1902
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:12,060
doing a trade job in order for terra to calm down he would
literally have to go off stream right now because i mean

1903
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:21,080
trade jobs does a lot too i mean nothing is gonna call him
down he's just gonna retweet that's why i didn't say it i

1904
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:26,980
was just like by so many people you know why why you're
saying this why you're saying that you're such a baby it's

1905
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:33,960
so annoying to read that it is a lot it's a lot of money but
i but i don't think you guys realize pro play is very

1906
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:42,080
stressful job you can clock out this is the thing no one is
a trade job you can clock in and clock out and there's like

1907
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:51,180
a set hours when you're a pro player you don't have downtime
you're 24 7 always grinding and mentally it is also very

1908
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:59,700
very taxing mentally as well and then you have to yeah no
that's what i'm trying to say i can try to make the matchup

1909
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:06,900
better and i can tell you guys you also like fuck up your
art hands too yeah you break your body and it breaks your

1910
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:13,280
body yeah but you guys don't understand pro play a lot of
pro players they fuck up their arms a lot as i said like

1911
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:23,620
right now uh gomez is like semi on a medical break because
he fucked up his his arm so he has to get a he has to get

1912
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:34,000
surgery apparently uh to fix his wrist and that's already
like a lot as well from pro play yeah so like he got carpal

1913
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:42,640
yeah carpal tunnel that's why i'm saying like i'm like
saying like i feel like pro play in general you do so much i

1914
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:52,100
mean you can always do so much like i like always grinding
rank always scrimming always vibe reviews and like it's like

1915
01:39:52,100 --> 01:40:02,360
you're destroying your mental and your body like so as well
slowly versus like clocking in and It's just for you, for

1916
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:02,500
you.

1917
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,700
And it's like the high end of gaming as well.

1918
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:05,400
Is it only me?

1919
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:07,100
I've never seen any Minecraft.

1920
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:07,480
Yeah.

1921
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,500
And so that's what I'm saying.

1922
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,340
I'm not saying like it is a lot of money.

1923
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:11,360
Like, oh, that's not a lot.

1924
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:15,360
I'm saying like how much they're dedicating themselves to a
game.

1925
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:18,060
I feel like they should be paid more in general.

1926
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:25,240
I feel like pro players get taken advantage a lot in like
orgs and like payment wise.

1927
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:30,780
Like I know like some pro teams and rivals got paid like 1k
for those who even qualify.

1928
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:39,860
qualified in ignite they got paid like one k a month you're
even qualifying you're like oh i'm so motivated ignite yeah

1929
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:45,720
we can do it tomorrow trust me we can do it tomorrow we're
rivals that's what i'm saying like i'm saying like i feel

1930
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:56,540
like they deserve to be paid more or like how much how much
they're how much work they're putting into yeah everyone

1931
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:06,860
needs to be paid more overall in all fields that's true yeah
uh i just said i'm down for about that's why a lot of them

1932
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:13,180
do streaming on the side that's why you see a lot of pro
players quit the moment they make it as a content creator

1933
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:20,820
because you make more as a content creator and they deal as
a game as a pro player yeah esports don't make money it's

1934
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:29,220
just all like a fucking it's all an investment and like uh
money like uh what's it called like a money like when is

1935
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:38,440
when is when it's late buddy you said when I fucking want it
to be and I put gold and that was the end yeah I was like if

1936
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:48,200
it's by hourly I feel like the amount of hours pro players
you put in versus like the amount of hours they put in to oh

1937
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:56,940
I don't know riding the game professionally feel like they
should be paid more because like i feel like like i said

1938
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:03,580
there's no you don't like as a content creator we don't have
half hours we don't have off hours same with professional

1939
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:11,320
players they don't really have off hours you supposed not to
come half an hour before what is that sleep schedule bro you

1940
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:16,680
live in america or what yeah i woke up at 6 a.m i i stayed
up i was like you know what i'm gonna take a little nap at

1941
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:25,660
noon wake up refreshed and ready i'm at least that makes a
counter shelf life later so it's i was watching by the way i

1942
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:33,820
was watching the the guy i was watching a guy tune pianos as
a trade job that looks so cool what's his name piano doctor

1943
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:41,360
and he travels around every day tuning pianos and he makes
like i think he makes like he was saying like oh this is how

1944
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:46,900
much i make per month like he was doing a new series but
he's making like this how much i make per month honestly i

1945
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:52,460
think he deserves to be paid more just because like he
spends a lot of hours tuning pianos and like Like, at the

1946
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:53,880
moment, it was a day 30.

1947
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,800
He's made, like, 10K, I think?

1948
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,320
10K so far.

1949
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,960
No, he gets paid for it.

1950
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:01,660
He does appointments.

1951
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:05,560
Yeah, apparently it's a super hard job because you have to
have a year for it, too.

1952
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,240
It's so cool.

1953
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:09,660
I have a lot of respect for people in trade jobs.

1954
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:15,700
Because, like, with the new day and age, we don't have
enough of people working in trade jobs.

1955
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:19,160
Because everyone, like, looks down at trade jobs now.

1956
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,720
Because they're like, oh, I should get a degree, blah, blah,
blah.

1957
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:29,100
i think trade is such an important i think we actually trade
jobs is such an important um just go phoenix wolf important

1958
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:37,020
for like like like i guess like how do i explain oh my gosh

go a different role we can't just all of ttk zeros

1961
01:43:52,940 --> 01:44:05,080
especially in um yeah i'm gonna mute real quick uh but like
especially in the uh especially in like the um like new

1962
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:15,980
generation uh a lot of people don't really know how to like
do your do what your diy stuff nowadays including me because

1963
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:18,140
all i do is call people i'm i'm part of the

1964
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:30,720
I'm part of the problem, but trade jobs are so important for
society So I have a lot of respect for people who go into

1965
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:36,600
trade because it's a lot of knowledge and it pays very well
I remember that self-park episode where like tradesmen

1966
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:45,660
became like So so in demand and then they're like um And
then they begin and they're like like please please we just

1967
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:48,100
need someone to fix the sink

1968
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:53,680
I just overlooked.

1969
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:56,920
Yeah, because everyone's like, I can just hire someone to do
it.

1970
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,980
But then, like, who's going to do it when everyone just
wants to hire someone?

1971
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,700
And a lot of people don't even know how to do it themselves
anymore.

1972
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:08,660
Yeah.

1973
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:17,420
I know, like, a lot of people, a lot of people in trade make
a lot of money now because they're so in demand.

1974
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:26,700
I know.

1975
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:30,540
Bro, one of my friends, one of my friends...

1976
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:41,080
friends dad dad's became a millionaire because he like he
started a trades company because i was like what the fuck

1977
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:50,520
like he's like he's like yeah because he so he like sources
like he employs a lot of tradesmen and then sourced them out

1978
01:45:50,520 --> 01:46:00,750
and then the guy literally became a millionaire and i'm like
oh my god i'm in the wrong market i like he was a tradesman

1979
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:06,150
and then he started his own company employing other
tradesmen and sourcing them out to people.

1980
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:12,830
I was like, damn, what the fuck?

1981
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:14,610
That guy, he's smart as hell.

1982
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:23,720
A lot of times when I hire someone for trade work, I try to
take note what they do in case I can do it myself next time.

1983
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:25,560
You stole.

1984
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,760
You're cheating the system.

1985
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,620
Do you not care about the poor tradesmen you're hiring?

1986
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:35,940
You're taking jobs from other tradesmen.

1987
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:59,540
do you not care trade sniping it's called knowledge I care
about my my trade now you know what's also easy you could

1988
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:07,820
there's also YouTube videos that you can to be fair I'm more
scared of looking up YouTube videos and trying to do it

1989
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:15,820
myself because I feel like I could I feel like I'm gonna
make it worse and then I and then I even more expensive be

1990
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:24,000
like hello um I sort of I fucked up and now my it's like I'm
trying to fix a leaky faucet and now the faucet won't give

1991
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,880
me water no more knowledge should be free

1992
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:42,720
yeah i feel like i can't that's why i'm i have to call
people

1993
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:53,500
hello the floor is flooded there's a floor in my apartment

1994
01:47:59,690 --> 01:48:03,930
yeah luckily i don't have anything broken in my apartment
for now

1995
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:15,910
but yeah any dragon's working in a trade job I acknowledge
and respect you

1996
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:26,490
also I think I think like nowadays like I remember seeing
people were like don't get don't get compute like because

1997
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:33,150
back then back then um I remember in the past I remember
like a couple of years like a couple of years ago people

1998
01:48:33,150 --> 01:48:41,330
were like you gotta get a computer science degree you gotta
get a engineer degree you gotta get like um it's always like

1999
01:48:41,330 --> 01:48:48,290
computer science science because like Silicon Valley and now
no one's hiring in Silicon Valley because there's too many

2000
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:56,210
people who got computer science degrees and now they're like
you oh you gotta do trade jobs now because apparently trade

2001
01:48:56,210 --> 01:49:05,570
jobs um pay and yeah yeah apparently like trade jobs pay
more than um a lot of college degrees now

2002
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:11,330
yeah the market got over flooded

2003
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:21,150
Yeah, new meta, guys, new meta drops.

2004
01:49:21,850 --> 01:49:23,810
It's no longer computer science.

2005
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:25,610
It's plumbing.

2006
01:49:28,810 --> 01:49:30,110
It's new meta.

2007
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,420
Which trade pays the best?

2008
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:42,220
I assume air conditioning.

2009
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:44,380
Air conditioning and heating.

2010
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:46,080
Air conditioning, heating, and plumbing.

2011
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:48,060
Not because of community, guys.

2012
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,760
The job meta is crazy.

2013
01:49:51,020 --> 01:50:06,100

it hvac what's hvac yeah oh yeah heating vending i assume so

2014
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:13,000
i feel like hvac pays the most because people especially if
you live somewhere especially if you live somewhere that's

2015
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:19,660
really fucking hot or cold they like people are desperate
including me i'm desperate um if it's like really hot and

feel like that

2018
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:54,190

opening window doesn't work anymore because the air is also

2019
01:50:54,190 --> 01:51:01,790
very hot It's not like the air is really hot or the air is
really cold.

2020
01:51:02,090 --> 01:51:04,660
So opening a window does not work no more.

2021
01:51:12,130 --> 01:51:14,710
You just use a fan.

2022
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:21,400
This is propaganda by Big Fly.

2023
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:28,240
Yeah, bugs and criminals can enter my very tall apartment
building.

2024
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:38,320
Yellow contractors, a low HVAC, plumbers, moving with trucks
pays deep cleaning wells but that can be tough to judge

2025
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:44,740
think of the super chat solid they get thank you i feel like
deep cleaning is like it's too much deep cleaning for me

2033
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:46,620
Yeah, I was just like, mold is the last thing you have to
worry about when you're deep cleaning.

Pop, pop, pop, pop.

2036
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:29,220
But yeah, in the end.

2037
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:37,520
Everyone should be paid more in all any of the jobs they
were, except for CEOs.

2038
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:44,240
Except for the CEOs, CTOs, CCOs, CEO.

2039
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:52,420
True.

2040
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,040
Don't give that to you.

2041
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:58,460
No, that's not me.

2042
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,580
I stop me.

2043
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:05,460
Wait, what Bougar got involved in what?

2044
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:06,920
What happened?

2045
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:08,260
In the Terra drama?

2046
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:10,600
The Terra versus Kingsman?

2047
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:12,920
No, I'm not.

2048
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:13,840
I'm the talent.

2049
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:18,980
Wait.

2050
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:22,500
The Bougar, someone said Bougar got involved.

2051
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:30,390
Really?

2052
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:32,630
Wait, who was the guy that said it?

2053
01:54:32,730 --> 01:54:34,550
The one guy was saying it.

2054
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:41,330
Bro, I'm sorry.

2055
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:48,130
so confused about it everyone said crisis was actually like
super toxic and everything i'm listening we picked them up

2056
01:54:48,130 --> 01:55:00,030
it was like the least toxic of our team the least did he
play for an a with oh okay i oh to kgc want to play n a but

2057
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:10,150
necros refuse oh shit oh that's the situation wait the
reason oh my god that's the reason why the matches haven't

2058
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:12,990
Are you fucking kidding?

2059
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:14,930
He did a really good job.

2060
01:55:15,150 --> 01:55:16,990
Wait, they haven't even started.

2061
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:21,030
They haven't started their matches yet for the tournament.

2062
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:24,750
They haven't started because they're just arguing about
whether they play EU or NA.

2063
01:55:24,770 --> 01:55:27,410
How long have they been arguing for?

2064
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:30,370
Necros and Kaiji.

2065
01:55:30,610 --> 01:55:33,330
There's 10 people from EU, but they want to force an A.

2066
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:33,790
So Necros.

2067
01:55:33,870 --> 01:55:35,550
Wait, so we can't start?

2068
01:55:36,090 --> 01:55:36,530
Yeah.

2069
01:55:36,990 --> 01:55:40,730
Yeah, because they're trying, they have every bracket.

2070
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:49,770
j3 no yeah yeah i'm so confused but maybe they wanted our
match to be broadcasted or some it could be that oh maybe

2071
01:55:49,770 --> 01:56:03,130
nine out of ten players are eu why not play eu wait the
other force in na so is it a dps unplayable that's great

2072
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:11,570
wait who is their na player for kaiji millennia oh so they
just want yeah they wanted their dps i just got a dm from

2073
01:56:11,570 --> 01:56:20,930
millennia saying i can't play daredevil on 140 thing well
apparently they're lobbying as bugs as well are they oh so

2074
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:27,910
it's still zero it's still zero zero are you how long have
they been arguing for like i thought i legit said in the

2075
01:56:27,910 --> 01:56:35,970
rule set if they can't agree it's balanced it's on balance
yeah latency i guess the eu players don't want balanced

2076
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:38,130
latency because it just adds for them

2077
01:56:47,900 --> 01:57:06,940
thinking I was just like why are we how long have they been
fighting for that's crazy that they're still fighting I

2078
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:15,480
thought like I thought you meant like the terror situation
because also there's chat hopped I literally went up and

2079
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:24,920
pull up uh I pulled pull it up TerraStream first and there's
a lot of people angry but yeah like anyway I said more

2080
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:35,590
people deserve to be paid more except for CEO, CTO, COOs all
the C's in in corporate America and the rest of the world

2081
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:47,280
and the rest of the world oh I think Bougar side oh Bougar
sided with Necros I think when

2082
01:57:50,340 --> 01:58:03,540
I am a talent you see I am a talent and CEO but like my
talent over over rules the CEO

2083
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:39,580
yeah oh my god what are they playing on oh they're playing
on EU now wait Necro's won

2084
01:58:43,090 --> 01:58:57,080
bro delena has to play on 165 ping bro that's that's crazy
yeah

2085
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:12,870
i'm one of the people guys bro one has to play 165 ping rest
in peace

2086
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:27,770
but i gotta use the bathroom i'll be right back guys

2087
02:00:46,130 --> 02:00:58,310
i'm back every tournament is to have drama yeah I I think
it's just the drama hype right now for the tournament

2088
02:01:08,370 --> 02:01:16,010
I have a lot of water it's because I'm coughing a lot yeah
literally draw it's it's it's I mean drama farming works why

2089
02:01:16,010 --> 02:01:24,650
do you think like all the biggest content creators just farm
drama now because I said it before it's because it put it

2090
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:32,610
makes people it puts you on the radar so people get you if
you're consistently farming drama that's why people always

2091
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:41,830
like reply to drama tweets too and engage in drama farming
because it just works like their names are always like their

2092
02:01:41,830 --> 02:01:48,670
names are always like in like in front of you too but

2093
02:01:52,150 --> 02:02:05,170
the community you get is like not worth it in general if you
consistently do it if you consistently do it it's like

2094
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:12,770
you're not really building a community you're just building
on people who are just there to be like when's the next drop

2095
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:21,910
like whoever's watching you to be like when's the next drama
and you're like hey my favorite TMZ I'm part of the problem

2096
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:29,230
I that's what I do on Twitter I'll be like hey hey time to
doom scroll

2097
02:02:32,850 --> 02:02:46,530
because like you know what's crazy like right after like
right after the kingsman drama um every even the girls that

2098
02:02:46,530 --> 02:02:55,970
were involved in the drama their viewership quadrupled right
after they have to put on followers mode but like like for

2099
02:02:55,970 --> 02:03:04,770
them they're literally farming ads off of it like it might
be like short term But there's like I saw they had some of

2100
02:03:04,770 --> 02:03:09,910
them had like 1 to 2k plus plus viewers now.

2101
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:15,870
But they do have to put followers mode or sub only mode.

2102
02:03:16,230 --> 02:03:23,990
But then the thing is that people would sub to them to like
to like troll them.

2103
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:25,970
And I'm like, you're so stupid.

2104
02:03:27,190 --> 02:03:31,750
Why are you giving money if you don't like them?

2105
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:35,070
Yeah, they sub just the shit talk.

2106
02:03:35,370 --> 02:03:37,710
I'm like, bro, you know what they...

2107
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:42,850

2131
02:04:49,410 --> 02:04:49,410
Right?

2132
02:04:49,730 --> 02:04:51,170

02:04:51,190 --> 02:04:51,430
Thank you.

2134
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:52,330
Thank you.

2135
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:54,250
We only hate.

2136
02:04:54,810 --> 02:04:55,130
All right.

2137
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:57,530
Type one of your hate watcher.

2138
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:01,770
Guys, type one of your hate watcher.

2139
02:05:02,230 --> 02:05:10,790
you with a super chat thank you thank you i don't like how
good you are at being a support all right i guess time to

2140
02:05:10,790 --> 02:05:21,850
run ads exactly what they do they're like whoa one to two k
viewers now all right time to run ads time to farm ads on

2141
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:31,530
these people don't worry i don't run ads i could make a lot
of money if i did run ads but i think i make it enough this

2142
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:35,250
is why i personally don't run ads even on Twitch or YouTube.

2143
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:40,830
If you get an ad on Twitch, it's an automatic ad that Twitch
forces you to, that just forces it to play.

2144
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:51,990
But I turn ads off on both Twitch and YouTube only because I
personally feel like I make enough money to not have to run

2145
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:52,470
ads.

2146
02:05:53,110 --> 02:06:02,910
And because of that, I want you guys to have a better
viewing experience because, uh, because that's I don't like,

2147
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:13,390
I don't run ads or use ad, uh, well, no, I, which I do not
encourage you to use.

2148
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:13,870
I,

2149
02:06:17,010 --> 02:06:21,830
I use one, dokey.

2150
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:28,470
Tokey.

2151
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:29,690
I didn't say anything.

2152
02:06:30,650 --> 02:06:43,850
I meant or use YouTube premium, which I also have guys i
guys i have youtube premium so i don't get ads and you could

2153
02:06:43,850 --> 02:07:00,200
also use youtube premium and you'll never get ads ever again
i didn't say anything i didn't and youtube premium is legal

2154
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:02,480
perfect landing that's a 10 out of 10.

2155
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:06,280
if i was on the olympics gymnastics team i would have have a
gold medal right now.

2156
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:14,920
Oh my god, they even paused the Necros match.

2157
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:17,220
When will we get her game?

2158
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:25,540
I have six hours to do the sponsored thing on Twitch.

2159
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:31,540
Please.

2160
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,600
Oh, crisis DC.

2161
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:39,640
Oh, no.

2162
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:41,600
They're stalling.

2242
02:13:21,450 --> 02:13:24,190
Waiting for next game.

2243

I'm waiting for the next game right now.

2246
02:13:35,270 --> 02:13:38,050
We all wait for Necro's game to end.

2247
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:42,290
because I think our game is

2248
02:13:46,620 --> 02:13:47,300
broadcasted.

2249
02:14:08,170 --> 02:14:09,690
Oh my god.

2250
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:11,770
Apparently every team has to wait.

2251
02:14:12,110 --> 02:14:12,270
Wait.

2252
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:15,830
Is this literally the first matchup?

2253
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:17,850
Oh my god.

2254
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:18,610

2255
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:29,150
this is the first game and they still have it.

2256
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:31,250
Oh my god.

2257
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:40,390

one to one right now it's game three no it's game three but

2258

I can't believe it how long were they arguing for

2264
02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:40,790
you just need to have a 50-minute argument.

2265
02:15:41,410 --> 02:15:45,150
Like, how long were they fighting before?

2266
02:15:48,870 --> 02:15:50,810
That's crazy.

2267
02:15:53,110 --> 02:15:54,870
Around 30...

2268
02:15:54,870 --> 02:15:56,250
Oh, my God.

2269
02:15:56,350 --> 02:15:58,910
They were fighting for 30 minutes.

2270
02:15:59,410 --> 02:16:03,750
There's no way they've been arguing for 30 minutes straight.

2271
02:16:09,370 --> 02:16:23,130
Bro, been streaming for two hours and they had a 30 minute

Thank you, thank you.

2278
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:58,770
As a consumer of Do-Keybird content, I've been influenced by
the advertisements presented to me live on stream and will

2279
02:16:58,770 --> 02:17:02,530
be making purchases using the Do-Keybird affiliation links
and codes provided.

2280
02:17:02,890 --> 02:17:03,750
Thank you for the super chat.

02:17:03,890 --> 02:17:04,610
Thank you, thank you.

2282
02:17:04,650 --> 02:17:05,090
Look at that.

2283
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:05,830
So natural.

2284
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,890
No paid actors.

2285
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:09,970
Thank you for your very...

2286
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:11,430
Oh, wait.

2287
02:17:12,930 --> 02:17:13,430
What is...

2288
02:17:13,430 --> 02:17:14,770
Oh, that's a replay?

2289
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:19,450
Are they like...

2290
02:17:19,970 --> 02:17:21,550
Oh, wait, that's like the real game.

2291
02:17:22,550 --> 02:17:23,210
Look at that.

2292
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:24,730
All natural.

2293
02:17:26,030 --> 02:17:28,470
A real consumer wrote that.

2294
02:17:33,990 --> 02:17:35,950
I can't even tell who's...

2295
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:36,430
Oh, wait.

2296
02:17:36,630 --> 02:17:37,510
Okay, he's defending.

2297
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:44,710
Oh, my God.

2298
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:45,170
Wait.

2299
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:47,010
Necros is 2 and 5.

2300
02:17:47,090 --> 02:17:53,670
He argued for 30 minutes, got his server, and Delana with
165 ping.

2301
02:17:53,830 --> 02:17:55,930
It's eight kills higher than him

2302
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:11,850
His his DPS partner who has a hundred and sixty five ping
right now has more guilt like does quadruple his kills Bro,

2303
02:18:12,190 --> 02:18:18,130
that's that's I'm sorry, but like that might be karma Might
be karma

2304
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:33,570
be karma right there no they they got necros won the
argument like boker cider with necros

2305
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:51,060
to be fair i feel like necros was in the right even if even
i don't know who's in the right it we just we lost 30

2306
02:18:51,060 --> 02:19:02,260
minutes i don't i it doesn't matter who's right or wrong
right now the rest of us waited 30 minutes.

2307
02:19:09,650 --> 02:19:11,950
I think it's also because they just rulebook.

2308
02:19:12,050 --> 02:19:13,730
They just use their rulebook excuse.

2309
02:19:17,910 --> 02:19:19,390
Yeah, we lost time.

2310
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:23,510
There are no winners in war.

2311
02:19:23,690 --> 02:19:24,690
We all suffered.

2312
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:46,940
It also cooled down everybody, including me.

2313
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:48,700
I'm not warmed up no more.

2314
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:52,680
You've been God for an hour?

2315
02:19:53,140 --> 02:19:53,140
Nothing.

2316
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:55,340
We've been stuck in purgatory.

2317
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:58,580
Don't worry.

2318
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,300
You missed nothing.

2319
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:02,480
We've been stuck in purgatory.

2320
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,480
Oh.

2321
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:08,840
They got the point.

2322
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:16,570
Wait.

2323
02:20:16,650 --> 02:20:18,210
Waiting for next game.

2324
02:20:18,450 --> 02:20:26,670
Watching the game that delayed the entire tournament.

2325
02:20:28,590 --> 02:20:30,010
There we go.

2326
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:33,770
There we go.

2327
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:37,950
For those who are wondering what we're doing here.

2328
02:20:47,910 --> 02:20:48,930
What's the score is left?

2329
02:20:58,290 --> 02:20:59,170
Yeah, we all...

2330
02:20:59,170 --> 02:21:01,110
The thing is, some teams are screaming again.

2331
02:21:01,350 --> 02:21:02,850

right now tarot just woke up oh my god wait i'm looking at

2370
02:26:51,860 --> 02:27:00,240

a broken dps you can't even win with me crashing I go

2372
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:23,820
support Shara's going support bro Sinatra can't hold back
the last holy shit that's crazy oh never win that's insane

2373
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:33,500
and then Necro's is complaining about triple support play
skillful heroes

2374
02:27:37,890 --> 02:27:39,770
that's insane

2375
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:55,040
this is the eu beef why does sinatra always say he wants to
play bro he could easily play you just need to like ask and

2376
02:27:55,040 --> 02:28:09,520
everyone will put it in wait terra's on rocket did you know
what okay you know what i'm i'm not in sinatra's chat

2377
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:15,180
actually i didn't know that i just yeah see they're
screaming right now

2378
02:28:24,930 --> 02:28:30,850
all right whose match is being streamed now i refresh do we
even know

2379
02:28:36,930 --> 02:28:45,430
what made him so mad is because they logically speaking it
should just be eu servers because there's all the both teams

2380
02:28:45,430 --> 02:28:53,870
only had two na players combined so like each team only had
one na player so logically they're like we should just go eu

2381
02:28:53,870 --> 02:29:04,650
fuck our na players like whatever um but then KGU was like
nah I want NA because it's default that's the default Matt

2382
02:29:04,650 --> 02:29:10,430
like that's the default just like terror is just like young
as you know and then it's just like that because in the rule

2383
02:29:10,430 --> 02:29:18,610
book he got rule booked and he's like it's NA or balanced
latency because uh they're their other deep uh their other

2384
02:29:18,610 --> 02:29:27,730
DPS has 160 ping and then one yeah they just wanted to screw
over the the these because they know Necro's hates ping You

2385
02:29:27,730 --> 02:29:36,870
know, they know Necro's hates playing with ping and he
always hated playing with ping And he's very vocal about

2386
02:29:36,870 --> 02:29:57,190
playing with ping So So they were trying Terra has Kings
been muted like in discord Wait, really Yeah, they won they

2387
02:29:57,190 --> 02:30:07,110

there's actually jerky flashbacks bro he did that too in the

2388
02:30:07,110 --> 02:30:18,830
boot camp we set beside him and he just full muted that's
how bad it was the boot camp it's crazy that's crazy they

2389

king's bin because he he's done with I think he just didn't

2390
02:30:28,990 --> 02:30:29,130
talk.

2391
02:30:29,150 --> 02:30:31,870
He's actually, he was like, I'm done with you.

2392
02:30:35,630 --> 02:30:36,510

2393
02:30:41,150 --> 02:30:41,190
Oh.

2394
02:30:41,830 --> 02:30:44,230
The Sinatra said he wouldn't, it's too funny.

2395
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:47,990
The Sinatra watch parties are always the best.

2396

He's just like so, so right about what he says all the time.

2398
02:30:54,890 --> 02:30:55,490
That's like the thing.

2399
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:58,470
I actually feel like he actually knows what's going on as a
spectator.

2400
02:30:58,470 --> 02:31:06,930
he's not a bot like he actually spectates and he understands

there was a comparison of Leon where Leon was handcrafted by

2487
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:57,500
the female devs of Resident Evil to make sure he appeals to
all women to the point where even the wrinkle placements,

2488
02:37:58,200 --> 02:38:02,200
even the wrinkle placements had to be like...

2489
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:09,900
happening for the good it had to be like approved by the
women literally 12 in the 16 hours yeah the women devs like

2499
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:53,160
two times with cloak mesh just went cloak but the next game
I mean we had we had moxie on starlord and I went there that

2500
02:39:53,160 --> 02:40:00,860
no it was two I saw I think I need to play that pool against
these guys was it and what if it was like version evil I

2501
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:06,940
also think cloak like hard counter starlord yeah i was like
resident evil 2 versus 4.

2502
02:40:07,540 --> 02:40:14,480
no but we played star it was a similar pose and everything
and i was like holy and then you can literally see his arm

2503
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:24,240
buffed up in requiem we should have won i need no why didn't
i bookmark it it's like oh but look at this look at this

2504
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:33,860
cute dog though what exactly do you want to do though but

2506
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:48,960
opening the cabinet for them we just kill him and he was
like yeah i think if we force someone heliphenix i think

2507
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:53,920
it's good for us that's like hella diemable hella phoenix is
not that good hella phoenix will shake his on by every dive

2508
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:59,120
tank it was like the same pose and everything again focus
their hell out of the whole game yeah mag is good

2509
02:41:04,870 --> 02:41:13,070
i can't wait for the modders i think they're just gonna play
cap like damn look at this like that's not the comparison

2510
02:41:13,070 --> 02:41:17,970
someone found like like what the the shirt stretch too

2511
02:41:21,090 --> 02:41:31,570

2512
02:41:31,570 --> 02:41:36,770

2513
02:41:37,530 --> 02:41:38,870
Leon deserves better.

2514
02:41:41,150 --> 02:41:42,210
I think they might put legion thing.

2515
02:41:42,410 --> 02:41:44,210
My manager found it!

2516
02:41:44,870 --> 02:41:47,350
Yesterday, just played like Darshtunk and Chippen's run.

2517
02:41:47,770 --> 02:41:49,890
He was very interested in this discussion.

2518
02:41:50,370 --> 02:41:51,690
Guys, look at this shit!

2519
02:41:53,490 --> 02:41:55,370
My manager started to switch.

2520
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:57,430
Guys, like, oh my god!

2521
02:41:57,890 --> 02:41:58,510
Look at him!

2522
02:41:58,610 --> 02:42:00,070
He went to the gym.

2523
02:42:00,230 --> 02:42:01,950
Yeah, what happened in three years?

2524
02:42:02,530 --> 02:42:05,930
I also like the triple support that was made from the Yeah,
I think so.

2525
02:42:06,110 --> 02:42:06,710
Like, look at that.

2526
02:42:07,150 --> 02:42:07,730
It's crazy.

2527
02:42:08,150 --> 02:42:08,610
That's like...

2528
02:42:09,030 --> 02:42:09,490
The only problem...

2529
02:42:09,490 --> 02:42:11,430
The only, like, thing that's bad.

2530
02:42:12,050 --> 02:42:13,930
Like, the only bad matchup for Triple Sport.

2531
02:42:14,210 --> 02:42:15,030
They're disgusting strats.

2532
02:42:15,190 --> 02:42:15,770
I'm disgusting.

2533
02:42:16,270 --> 02:42:17,090
Leon's glow up.

2534
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:18,730
They might play...

2535
02:42:18,730 --> 02:42:20,270
Don't worry for those who...

2536
02:42:20,270 --> 02:42:22,450
This is...

2537
02:42:22,450 --> 02:42:22,870
Don't worry.

2538
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:24,310
I just need...

2539
02:42:24,310 --> 02:42:25,690
I don't need to listen to this yet.

2540
02:42:26,010 --> 02:42:27,530
The Gale Hulk comes out.

2541
02:42:28,110 --> 02:42:29,150
The Kale Hulk.

2542
02:42:30,090 --> 02:42:31,090
The Gale Hulk.

2543
02:42:31,370 --> 02:42:31,890
Oh, my God.

2544
02:42:31,970 --> 02:42:32,390
Look at this.

2545
02:42:32,590 --> 02:42:33,030
Oh, my God.

2546
02:42:33,070 --> 02:42:33,790
Wait, not like that.

2547
02:42:35,290 --> 02:42:44,790
Deadpool gun and e like holy shit bro the e is on tank
Deadpool is so OP it's literally higher it's literally

2548
02:42:44,790 --> 02:42:54,450
higher damage yeah no it's literally more damage than DPS
Deadpool it's just this is higher DPS Deadpool the women

2549
02:42:54,450 --> 02:43:04,770
knew what they wanted they knew what they wanted guys 20%
teammates the women knew I actually have like no idea why

2550
02:43:04,770 --> 02:43:11,530
like like DPS Deadpool's key and like tank Deadpool's key
upgrade aren't like swapped like why even like every wrinkle

2551
02:43:11,530 --> 02:43:22,110
was like purposely placed yeah it makes no sense I mean then
kind of DPS then tank Deadpool is kind of well they said

2552
02:43:22,110 --> 02:43:31,130
ready whenever I like this look at this tweet look at this
ready whenever is what they said in this tweet I don't know

2553
02:43:31,130 --> 02:43:34,450
I'm ready L7 I think so

2554
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:50,560
his chest grew like six inches bro no he deserves better
than Ada guys and I think there's a lot of volunteers

2555
02:43:50,560 --> 02:44:07,620
outside yeah oh I just don't worry a lot of us are willing
to take that sacrifice yeah it just came up again someone

2556
02:44:07,620 --> 02:44:17,460
like uploaded like a file that yeah you know aida has been
checking everything he she has faded leo for too long i

2557
02:44:17,460 --> 02:44:30,260
think we just he wants to settle down i'll take the ball
i'll take it just interesting it's gonna be out soon i don't

2558
02:44:30,260 --> 02:44:36,660
remember when let's lock in speedery you got it you got this
i believe in all of us i think we can bring it home i

2559
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:40,620
actually think i was watching so as well I'm confident.

2560
02:44:41,700 --> 02:44:43,780
I think we just figured out what we need to play.

2561
02:44:43,800 --> 02:44:46,420
I know at least one girl who hated that change.

2562
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:49,600
Look, there's always going to be critics.

2563
02:44:53,280 --> 02:44:55,800
Look, there's always going to be critics.

2564
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:56,960
We can play triple support.

2565
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:59,680
There's always going to be people with bad tastes.

2566
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:02,380
Yeah, save TV first and maybe last save mentors.

2567
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:05,600
Who am I going to vanish in this match?

2568
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:09,020
There's always one person that has bad taste.

2569
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:25,480
and that's your friend i think so too i think actually so
too okay i think if we get cloak out we just play the game

2570
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:34,720
and we just win yeah like i just go deadpool and i just
shoot them and we just win in the safe i guess yeah i'm

2571
02:45:34,720 --> 02:45:46,120
banning it then loki and cloak no last yeah yeah sounds good
because who's gonna go mantis in the team no one no no no

2572
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:55,400
one yeah i mean maybe gail can wait but we said we said that
last time for cloak and then they went like what they safe

2573
02:45:55,400 --> 02:46:03,740
did you mean no no no gail like he can i mean he can play
mantis i've seen he can pick it but it's not good at it okay

2574
02:46:03,740 --> 02:46:11,120
yes yeah good they've been wrong jeff i'm saving jeff It's
okay.

2575
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:12,180
I think I have to save it.

2576
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:14,520
I don't want to play Luna Invis, to be honest.

2577
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:17,120
I could save Invis, but I don't want to play it.

2578
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:19,120
We could play triple support with Jeff too.

2579
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:19,880
Yeah, we'll do this.

2580
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:21,640
Because we still have Cloak open.

2581
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:22,760
Yeah, I think so.

2582
02:46:22,820 --> 02:46:24,600
We have Cloak and Grook open.

2583
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:27,240
Cloak, Adam, or like Loki, yeah, true.

2584
02:46:27,420 --> 02:46:29,200
Yeah, Loki's like, I bet they ban Cloak.

2585
02:46:29,660 --> 02:46:30,360
Watch this.

2586
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:31,520
Beat has a mean Jeff in him.

2587
02:46:31,580 --> 02:46:32,200
Oh, nice!

2588
02:46:32,700 --> 02:46:33,280
That's fine.

2589
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:33,540
Phoenix.

2590
02:46:33,740 --> 02:46:35,000
Okay, I'll ask for the name more, okay?

2591
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:36,180
Yeah, no more.

2592
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:38,280
If they save it, I ban Mac, okay?

2593
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:39,020
Yeah.

2594
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:40,160
Oh, they banned Namor.

2595
02:46:40,360 --> 02:46:41,260
Are they saving Namor?

2596
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:41,700
Streamsnapping.

2597
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:42,660
See what we can do.

2598
02:46:43,180 --> 02:46:44,020
Is it not Phoenix now?

2599
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:45,600
We can take another support here.

2600
02:46:45,700 --> 02:46:46,640
They're going to take Hello.

2601
02:46:46,940 --> 02:46:48,520
See if they can.

2602
02:46:48,540 --> 02:46:48,800
Ah.

2603
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:50,720
We can also ban Hella.

2604
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:53,940
Hello's not a bad ban, but they're going to go Namor, Namor
Phoenix.

2605
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:55,620
We could ban Hello, I think.

2606
02:46:56,460 --> 02:46:56,700
Yeah.

2607
02:46:56,840 --> 02:46:58,580
A rocket, maybe.

2608
02:46:58,720 --> 02:46:59,780

2609
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:02,360

We're playing.

2613
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:06,100
We're playing through support, I think.

2614
02:47:06,380 --> 02:47:06,640
Okay.

02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:07,740

02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:05,260
The Emma has a problem.

2722
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:07,040

2723
02:52:07,040 --> 02:52:08,040
I think Black is good here.

2724
02:52:08,820 --> 02:52:09,880

2726
02:52:11,660 --> 02:52:12,180

2731
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:23,340

02:52:27,020 --> 02:52:28,460
DLP, I want you to swap, though.

2736
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:30,140
I don't think you should play what you're playing.

2737
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:32,100
We need something to play.

2738
02:52:32,260 --> 02:52:34,900
Yeah, I think you need to go Emma too.

2739
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:36,660
You can play Emma herself, that's open.

2740
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:37,840

2741
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:38,100

2744
02:52:40,440 --> 02:52:42,820
You'll meet open Jeff because they used the Eon.

2745
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:47,120
Can you try Loki?

2746
02:52:47,620 --> 02:52:47,720

2749
02:52:51,720 --> 02:52:52,100

Yeah, I think Jeff.

2752
02:52:54,400 --> 02:52:55,940
I think Jeff is a Joker character.

2753
02:52:57,660 --> 02:52:58,820
Just go, just go.

2754
02:52:59,040 --> 02:52:59,380

They used underline for it.

2760
02:53:05,060 --> 02:53:05,980
I think they used it.

2761
02:53:06,840 --> 02:53:07,740
Yeah, they're walking them in.

2762
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:08,140

2808
02:54:53,060 --> 02:54:53,700
I'm on rocket, trust me.

2809
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:55,360
Rocket off.

2810
02:54:55,940 --> 02:54:56,300
Low.

2811
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:57,800
Oh, he's just on the pillar.

2812
02:54:58,060 --> 02:54:58,420
Good.

2813
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:01,300
Oh, he's just on the pillar.

2814
02:55:01,300 --> 02:55:01,340
Yeah.

2815
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:02,880
I'm one, do you have anything?

2816
02:55:03,240 --> 02:55:03,860
I'm probably right.

2817
02:55:03,860 --> 02:55:03,960
I'm probably right.

2818
02:55:04,960 --> 02:55:05,780
I'm going side.

2819
02:55:06,560 --> 02:55:07,980
Yeah, yeah.

2820
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:12,040
Still getting chased by Angela on the side.

2821
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:13,820
No, Angela is a problem.

2822
02:55:15,140 --> 02:55:15,920
Go, group up.

2823
02:55:16,060 --> 02:55:16,500
Next fight.

2824
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:20,740
I think if you need to name one again.

2825
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:22,960
I think stay name one, Moxie, honestly.

2826
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:24,740
Okay, I'll go swap.

2827
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:26,180
Yeah, wait a minute.

2828
02:55:26,340 --> 02:55:26,900
Play one fight.

2829
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:27,540
Play one fight.

2830
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:30,740
I go from behind.

2831
02:55:30,880 --> 02:55:31,540
I go from behind.

2832
02:55:32,020 --> 02:55:32,360
Thank you Laura.

2833
02:55:32,460 --> 02:55:33,120
Thank you, Laura.

2834
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:34,080
3, 2.

2835
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:34,520
Okay.

2836
02:55:34,640 --> 02:55:35,540
Just mocking me.

2837
02:55:35,960 --> 02:55:36,100
Angela.

2838
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:38,500
Angelou, look, look.

2839
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:38,740
Look, look, look.

2840
02:55:39,640 --> 02:55:40,000
Wow.

2841
02:55:42,580 --> 02:55:42,980
You're in the army.

2842
02:55:43,500 --> 02:55:44,300
Can you, can you, can you can.

2843
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:45,360
Please don't, rock forward.

2844
02:55:45,620 --> 02:55:45,960
Rock forward.

2845
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:46,300
Walk forward.

2846
02:55:47,700 --> 02:55:48,420
Oh no.

2847
02:55:49,860 --> 02:55:50,640
She got broke.

2848
02:55:50,660 --> 02:55:51,580
TP if someone touches.

2849
02:55:51,580 --> 02:55:52,260
TP if someone touches.

2850
02:55:56,620 --> 02:55:58,100
I'm gonna put it facing us.

2851
02:55:58,900 --> 02:55:59,980
It's facing the corner to a point.

2852
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:00,580
It's facing the corner.

2853
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:10,900
I'm trying to get him I'm going to be close to you I'm
banning Emma from this guy There's no chance He just does

2854
02:56:10,900 --> 02:56:18,200
infinite damage We can never walk anywhere on map He's just
in main and he's just not dying Wait, no more, no more, no

2855
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:20,960
more No more, no more

2856
02:56:25,240 --> 02:56:31,520
That's huge, that's huge There's a phoenix behind No more
one, no more one.

2857
02:56:31,980 --> 02:56:33,660
They're done, they're done, Rocket.

2858
02:56:35,320 --> 02:56:37,180
You have no support.

2859
02:56:37,660 --> 02:56:38,580
You have no support.

2860
02:56:40,660 --> 02:56:42,660
I won't disappear so easily.

2861
02:56:47,260 --> 02:56:48,260
What is this so annoying?

2862
02:56:50,440 --> 02:56:51,860
I don't know what to do.

2863
02:56:52,060 --> 02:56:54,000
Crying doesn't work no more, guys.

2864
02:56:54,240 --> 02:56:55,800
No, I really think it's the Emma.

2865
02:56:56,160 --> 02:56:57,240
I actually think it's the Emma.

2866
02:56:57,340 --> 02:56:59,180
The crying doesn't work no more.

2867
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:00,140
Yeah, but it lasts.

2868
02:57:01,440 --> 02:57:13,440
can also match it no we have we have it open i don't know i
feel like i like i i ult deep i die i ult my team i die with

2869
02:57:13,440 --> 02:57:21,220
cloak and i'm like i don't know where to go where do i go
what is about the cloak then we just get cooked by it then

2870
02:57:21,220 --> 02:57:31,200
will they save clock yeah we lost when we had clock so i
think not a big deal no they will have a cloak that's a

2871
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:42,420
problem no crying got patch i mean we won against clock
already when not again yeah but i mean we lost with clock as

2872
02:57:42,420 --> 02:57:54,040
well what i mean we're saying he's saying he's saying this
map we lost with cloak but there is like no more altering it

2873
02:57:54,040 --> 02:58:01,140
but yeah i think we can also if we just lived there we
actually win the fights i think like but the first the first

2874
02:58:01,140 --> 02:58:09,320
half there was no room there was no room for me to cloak
also that's the thing there was no room for me to cloak for

2875
02:58:09,320 --> 02:58:18,020
me to get into but second one i could have gone into a room
then emma mag yeah or something like that what does

2876
02:58:18,020 --> 02:58:25,840
typically play then and the second map there was no room for
me to because I tried to go into that little cubby hole but

2877
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:37,720
it was I didn't have an extra I didn't have an extra dash
yeah we need to take it's rough because it's like there's

2878
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:47,400
it's harder to find a room we probably have to take loki and
we can ban emma instead it's the first slot I mean we can

2879
02:58:47,400 --> 02:58:50,160
also ban phoenix but like not you want about namer dps

2880
02:58:56,320 --> 02:59:03,300
I'd much rather I have Jay on anything else but name more
yeah I think we've been named I'm shooting the squids but

2881
02:59:08,590 --> 02:59:17,050
yeah I know I should be on club for him when I fade but even
then I had no too much there was there was like how do we

2882
02:59:17,050 --> 02:59:22,790
stop it's so hard to like to like pat like to do it because
they always grab me too.

2883
02:59:24,790 --> 02:59:25,510
Banned Invis maybe?

2884
02:59:26,810 --> 02:59:27,390
We can't ban Invis.

2885
02:59:27,730 --> 02:59:28,870
No, we can't just save it first.

2886
02:59:29,310 --> 02:59:29,710
Ban Rocket.

2887
02:59:31,050 --> 02:59:31,770
Doesn't really help.

2888
02:59:32,330 --> 02:59:36,830
I think I think we can probably just I mean, you can
probably just ban ban the more and match the Emma if they

2889
02:59:36,830 --> 02:59:37,310
have an Emma.

2890
02:59:38,430 --> 02:59:39,650
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

2891
02:59:41,790 --> 02:59:42,970
You think you can match it.

2892
02:59:43,030 --> 02:59:44,450
I really think we need to ban it.

2893
02:59:44,910 --> 02:59:46,770
Like I just see that like the problem.

2894
02:59:46,770 --> 02:59:49,050
I was spam right click sometimes it doesn't matter.

2895
02:59:49,310 --> 02:59:55,530
It doesn't work when you already get the if they have emma
on point too if he's on mac then he should just die but on

2896
02:59:55,530 --> 03:00:01,630
emma he just lives because he has diamond form he can go out
he has shield he has uh good awareness on how to play i

2897
03:00:01,630 --> 03:00:08,650
don't think he has the same on mac yeah if i guess you see
it once you can't fade so it's all like it really sucks too

2898
03:00:08,650 --> 03:00:13,950
because they are hard focus you i get what you guys are
saying though like we can ban both emma mac or we can ban

2899
03:00:13,950 --> 03:00:21,690
name of phoenix you know that's also i think we i we ban
emma no more in the middle i think i'm pretty they won't

2900
03:00:21,690 --> 03:00:28,290
save they won't save emma i'm pretty sure they will save cro
czasie anything you want to ban both namor phoenix or what

2901
03:00:28,290 --> 03:00:34,770
no i think you no i think you do look at gambit into leon
again and then if you do namor middle and then that's what

2902
03:00:34,770 --> 03:00:41,030
you can do i think they will either save thing angela but
i'm gonna scroll through twitter while they've figured this

2903
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:47,410
out did you guys know you can play call of duty now on
hightail if they if they suddenly just save emma then yeah

2904
03:00:47,410 --> 03:00:55,090
yeah like literally there is someone telling him what to do
what map should we pick did you guys see that yeah that's a

2905
03:00:55,090 --> 03:01:04,190
good question modders modders added uh call of duty in
hightail let me say you find the mod the mokey map is there

2906
03:01:04,190 --> 03:01:18,650
still proof yeah yeah yeah i think that one's good modding's
crazy they literally they literally recreated the ship in

2907
03:01:18,650 --> 03:01:33,460
call of duty yeah we can do the flop your back no actually i
want to try this oh it looks like we play roblox yeah it

2908
03:01:33,460 --> 03:01:36,920
looks very well done Bro, there's even movement tech.

2909
03:01:37,100 --> 03:01:37,880
You see that shit?

2910
03:01:38,280 --> 03:01:38,620
They lost the map against.

2911
03:01:38,900 --> 03:01:41,680
Yeah, they lost the map against, but they never lost the
series.

2912
03:01:43,580 --> 03:01:46,200
That was the only map they lost on Hell's Heaven.

2913
03:01:50,900 --> 03:01:52,000
What did these other teams ban?

2914
03:01:53,380 --> 03:01:56,460
Also blue guys, blue is now Minecraft!

2915
03:01:57,280 --> 03:01:59,680
We should play this on stream.

2916
03:01:59,800 --> 03:02:02,060
I'm going to put, I'm going to write this down for myself.

2917
03:02:02,460 --> 03:02:03,060
Stream ideas.

2918
03:02:03,360 --> 03:02:06,000
It was on Mag, not even Emma here.

2919
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:14,960
they don't want to write this down but he also played
hawkeye i want to remind myself next next whenever i have a

2920
03:02:14,960 --> 03:02:18,460
schedule opening oh games

2921
03:02:22,250 --> 03:02:36,370
ready i haven't found out here maybe we need to give loki
honestly like if we play and then they low key close do you

2922
03:02:36,370 --> 03:02:38,710
think they can defend themselves well Yeah, Loki.

2923
03:02:40,550 --> 03:02:41,110
Yeah, okay.

2924
03:02:41,410 --> 03:02:43,870
And take Nemo or Phoenix.

2925
03:02:44,210 --> 03:02:44,610
It's fine.

2926
03:02:45,270 --> 03:02:46,070
Minecraft 2 is fine.

2927
03:02:46,570 --> 03:02:46,910
It's okay.

2928
03:02:47,750 --> 03:02:48,290
We do that.

2929
03:02:49,170 --> 03:02:50,310
But I think we save...

2930
03:02:50,310 --> 03:02:52,750
Actually, I think we should go a completely different road.

2931
03:02:53,250 --> 03:02:55,590
I think we should ban Emma Mac and we take...

2932
03:02:55,590 --> 03:02:56,450
And we save Mantis.

2933
03:02:57,650 --> 03:02:58,450
That's what I'm thinking.

2934
03:02:59,250 --> 03:02:59,610
You get what I mean?

2935
03:02:59,730 --> 03:03:01,110
They would just go Angela though.

2936
03:03:02,090 --> 03:03:02,270
So?

2937
03:03:02,810 --> 03:03:03,570
We just shoot him, no?

2938
03:03:04,710 --> 03:03:06,790
Yeah, I think we just play Bunker and we...

2939
03:03:06,790 --> 03:03:07,830
Yeah, I think we just Bunker and we...

2940
03:03:07,850 --> 03:03:13,730
shoot him like i don't think these guys can play like dive
or like um they can only play this yeah they will not go for

2941
03:03:13,730 --> 03:03:20,390
long they will not happen they will not go there they will
full dive oh it's so crazy that this guy climbed up this

2942
03:03:20,390 --> 03:03:25,790
will not happen and they will not pull it out that tower on
netflix they don't have a match is gonna go jeff but then we

2943
03:03:25,790 --> 03:03:34,190
have i think it's crazy that we had literally had a live
stream of that man climbing up the fucking tower live on

2944
03:03:34,190 --> 03:03:44,130
camera i think we do gambit i think that's insane they had
so much hope on that guy we do we do ben gambit save mantis

2945
03:03:44,130 --> 03:03:55,770
ben uh they had so much hope that he will not die live on
stream yeah i'm gonna say it ready and then the last one

2946
03:03:55,770 --> 03:03:57,610
yeah yeah the last one we do mark

2947
03:04:01,330 --> 03:04:09,490
be honest of a guy climbing like one of the tallest
buildings in the world with like no harness no harness no

2948
03:04:09,490 --> 03:04:17,750
like wires or like no safety net he literally just climbed a
town like a thousand two thousand almost what was it it was

2949
03:04:17,750 --> 03:04:26,290
like two like a thousand 900 something meters or some yeah
super annoying for him um i think we do that we we play a

2950
03:04:26,290 --> 03:04:41,230
little and it was like all live and he only got 500k like
bro that guy literally risked his entire life on live on

2951
03:04:41,230 --> 03:04:56,210
stream that's crazy okay which heroes will get my confidence
No, you don't like five bro like he deserves like at least a

2952
03:04:56,210 --> 03:05:07,650
million dollars for that shit And that's before taxes that's
That's I'm pretty sure he didn't pay all up front in cash.

2953
03:05:07,750 --> 03:05:15,750
I'm pretty sure Netflix did not pay all up front in cash
That's before the taxes hit Is it that good though?

2954
03:05:16,730 --> 03:05:19,830
If we have like brawl, I don't think it should be that good.

2955
03:05:20,470 --> 03:05:27,010
Yeah, I don't think you can get anyone a good triple support
bro yeah i just think he deserves to be paid more for that

2956
03:05:29,690 --> 03:05:37,270
let me see what he said he would have to it's like those i
don't like people who do this like extreme sports they

2957
03:05:37,270 --> 03:05:44,050
literally like in their brain they have no like they don't
have the in him the the fear in their brain like they they

2958
03:05:44,050 --> 03:05:51,730
it's like actual like like like their brain doesn't have the
the function to tell them to be afraid of something and then

2959
03:05:51,730 --> 03:05:59,110
last but and is emma name or mac or phoenix like that's why
they just feel they don't yeah no inhibitions at all that's

2960
03:05:59,110 --> 03:06:03,830
why people do extreme sports we have cloake because they
don't have i think i think we banned it more but it's

2961
03:06:03,830 --> 03:06:24,350
actually like a mental thing it's like one less thing to

03:21:27,960 --> 03:21:29,000
I blinded them.

3499
03:21:29,020 --> 03:21:30,120
Two, one.

3500
03:21:30,340 --> 03:21:30,540
I'm holding them.

3501
03:21:30,540 --> 03:21:31,120
I'm holding them.

3502
03:21:31,220 --> 03:21:32,620
I'm holding them.

3503
03:21:32,760 --> 03:21:34,020
I have mine.

3504
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:35,680
I have mine.

3505
03:21:35,740 --> 03:21:36,020
I have mine.

3506
03:21:36,180 --> 03:21:36,480
I have mine after soon.

3507
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:38,440
Yo, can we go back then soon?

3508
03:21:39,220 --> 03:21:40,160
Yeah, I can hold.

3509
03:21:40,280 --> 03:21:40,940
I can hold this.

3510
03:21:40,940 --> 03:21:41,420
Two, one.

3511
03:21:41,620 --> 03:21:44,240

03:21:47,640 --> 03:21:51,740
Need a lift, need a lift, need a lift.

3514
03:21:53,100 --> 03:21:54,740
Come back, come back, come back to me.

3515
03:21:54,740 --> 03:21:55,220
Back to me!

3516
03:21:55,680 --> 03:21:56,100
Where are they?

3517
03:21:56,320 --> 03:21:57,440
Come here, come here, come here.

3518
03:21:58,380 --> 03:21:59,780
I'll go met this.

3519
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:02,240
Yeah, go met this, go met this, go met this.

3520
03:22:02,940 --> 03:22:04,780
Wait, there's a guy behind us.

3521
03:22:04,800 --> 03:22:06,040
Wait, what thing, what thing, what thing?

3522
03:22:08,260 --> 03:22:08,720
I got my own.

3523
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:10,080
They have nothing, guys.

3524
03:22:10,140 --> 03:22:10,760
They both support us.

3525
03:22:10,940 --> 03:22:11,060
Yeah, yeah.

3526
03:22:11,300 --> 03:22:12,080
You only have my, right?

3527
03:22:12,780 --> 03:22:13,640
Yeah, they're looking bad.

3528
03:22:14,020 --> 03:22:16,060
I can probably force them up with my shovel.

3529
03:22:17,400 --> 03:22:18,120
Yeah, I can bubble you.

3530
03:22:18,120 --> 03:22:18,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3531
03:22:21,240 --> 03:22:22,200
Come to me, come to me.

3532
03:22:22,340 --> 03:22:23,020
Let's get me this.

3533
03:22:23,180 --> 03:22:23,700
I want to watch.

3534
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:24,580
Oh, God.

3535
03:22:24,740 --> 03:22:25,500
Yeah, what the?

3536
03:22:25,560 --> 03:22:26,660
We're both together.

3537
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:27,320
I need to hop on you.

3538
03:22:28,540 --> 03:22:28,660
I have a hunt.

3539
03:22:28,660 --> 03:22:29,920
You're killing me.

3540
03:22:30,040 --> 03:22:30,240
You're damage.

3541
03:22:30,460 --> 03:22:31,020
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

3542
03:22:31,400 --> 03:22:33,200
Bucky one, Bucky one, Bucky one.

3543
03:22:33,260 --> 03:22:33,500
No fight.

3544
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:34,420
No fight.

3545
03:22:35,380 --> 03:22:36,180
Think, think, think, think, think.

3546
03:22:36,180 --> 03:22:36,900
Think one, think one.

3547
03:22:37,540 --> 03:22:39,260
Think one, think one, think one.

3548
03:22:39,280 --> 03:22:41,160
Live it, live it, live it, live it, live it.

3549
03:22:41,220 --> 03:22:41,840
I got pushed back.

3550
03:22:41,980 --> 03:22:42,520
I got pulled back.

3551
03:22:43,740 --> 03:22:44,220
I have all in one.

3552
03:22:44,340 --> 03:22:44,760
I have all in one.

3553
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:45,100
Well now.

3554
03:22:45,340 --> 03:22:45,520
What thing?

3555
03:22:45,880 --> 03:22:46,020
What thing?

3556
03:22:46,140 --> 03:22:46,320
What thing?

3557
03:22:46,360 --> 03:22:46,500
What thing?

3558
03:22:46,720 --> 03:22:46,860
What thing?

3559
03:22:49,100 --> 03:22:49,740
I'm here.

3560
03:22:50,660 --> 03:22:51,120
I'm going.

3561
03:22:52,360 --> 03:22:52,680
I'm going.

3562
03:22:56,860 --> 03:23:04,700
I think you go Hawkeye.

3563
03:23:04,780 --> 03:23:05,720
I mean, I want Hawkeye.

3564
03:23:06,960 --> 03:23:07,700
No, no, no.

3565
03:23:07,700 --> 03:23:09,140
I want a speedery to go Mantis.

3566
03:23:09,200 --> 03:23:09,820
It's too late now.

3567
03:23:09,920 --> 03:23:10,640
We just played the fight.

3568
03:23:11,100 --> 03:23:12,680
Just damage boost me and pray for the best.

3569
03:23:13,580 --> 03:23:14,560
Let's walk up.

3570
03:23:16,780 --> 03:23:17,600
I eat this.

3571
03:23:18,640 --> 03:23:18,820
Yeah.

3572
03:23:19,080 --> 03:23:20,160
Walk up, walk up, walk up.

3573
03:23:20,300 --> 03:23:20,740
Can we go with mine?

3574
03:23:20,860 --> 03:23:21,120
Can we go with mine?

3575
03:23:21,260 --> 03:23:21,520
Can we go with mine?

3576
03:23:21,720 --> 03:23:22,060
Walk up.

3577
03:23:22,140 --> 03:23:22,980
Kill the thing.

3578
03:23:23,060 --> 03:23:23,420
Kill the thing.

3579
03:23:26,540 --> 03:23:27,260
I blinded?

3580
03:23:27,260 --> 03:23:28,360
I blinded, I blinded, I blinded.

3581
03:23:29,840 --> 03:23:30,560
I can't.

3582
03:23:31,060 --> 03:23:32,000
Damage me, damage me.

3583
03:23:32,140 --> 03:23:32,920
It's everyone, it's everyone.

3584
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:35,100
Three, two, one.

3585
03:23:35,980 --> 03:23:36,840
I'm alting this?

3586
03:23:37,940 --> 03:23:38,780
Oh, you altered too.

3587
03:23:40,860 --> 03:23:41,980
Kill the Bucky, kill the Bucky.

3588
03:23:42,780 --> 03:23:44,760
Come to me, come to me, come to me.

3589
03:23:45,280 --> 03:23:47,420
Sue, Sue, Sue, no jump, Sue, no jump on me.

3590
03:23:47,740 --> 03:23:49,200
I can't, I can't.

3591
03:23:50,620 --> 03:23:52,140
I'll hit, I'll hit, I'll hit.

3592
03:23:52,360 --> 03:23:53,140
I'm trying to heal you, Winnie.

3593
03:23:56,040 --> 03:23:58,200
I don't have fade, I don't have fade, I don't have fade.

3594
03:24:08,180 --> 03:24:13,400
I just can't kill it.

3595
03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:14,120
It's impossible.

3596
03:24:14,480 --> 03:24:15,540
Every cloak wins the fight.

3597
03:24:15,860 --> 03:24:16,300
It's so annoying.

3598
03:24:20,920 --> 03:24:26,880
Yeah, even on Hawkeye, like, the instantly bubble, I'd break
in there like body blocking I thought I was next.

3599
03:24:27,340 --> 03:24:33,680
on me just think jumps mag is shielding i thought i was next

3600
03:24:40,290 --> 03:24:51,850
we were swapping comms non-stop too me and wendy didn't say
who's supposed to yeah yeah to try to find it when i crudled

3601
03:24:53,070 --> 03:25:01,310
but it's okay i also feel like it's not up to me to figure
out who's like to to be aware of who's alting first but i

3602
03:25:01,310 --> 03:25:07,970
really i feel like it I don't say who's gonna do the same
thing on any hero in the game yeah but I feel like why why

3603
03:25:07,970 --> 03:25:12,570
am I always the one asking who else first you know the
raccoon at least we can kill I don't know what I'm supposed

3604
03:25:12,570 --> 03:25:18,090
to do in this matchup but it's like when I forget to ask
like this is a hundred yeah what matchup but it's like

3605
03:25:18,090 --> 03:25:26,090
doesn't matter we don't win it so we need to play something
different I feel like it sucks because when I'm like focused

3606
03:25:26,090 --> 03:25:31,290
sometimes I don't remember how or more remembering to ask
who else first and i don't check we're just gonna fight them

3607
03:25:31,290 --> 03:25:44,090
again on the final it's just how it has to go but i'm always
the one asking who else first and i'm the baby though i'm

3608
03:25:44,090 --> 03:25:51,690
the baby we're just not killing locals bro it's so like we
also we also just completely i we also completely threw a

3609
03:25:51,690 --> 03:25:58,250
fight because i got like tp'd off the map randomly yeah i
know yeah she actually got tp'd

3610
03:26:03,570 --> 03:26:05,410
They patched the crike.

3611
03:26:05,650 --> 03:26:06,810
No more crying.

3612
03:26:07,130 --> 03:26:08,390
They patched it.

3613
03:26:09,430 --> 03:26:10,710
No more crying.

3614
03:26:11,310 --> 03:26:12,110
I just got to be aware.

3615
03:26:12,350 --> 03:26:14,290
I have to always, gotta be aware to ask.

3616
03:26:14,630 --> 03:26:23,930
I fixed the, I fixed the dying up thing, but now I have to
remember to ask who, like I have to check tab and ask who

3617
03:26:23,930 --> 03:26:24,890
else first.

3618
03:26:31,790 --> 03:26:34,890
that game was so winnable

3619
03:26:37,980 --> 03:26:42,140
fucking close someone said you need to make decision
yourself instead of waiting for them that i like the thing

3620
03:26:42,140 --> 03:26:50,340
is i make a decision myself i double all with them i i
either i have to it's like i can't win somehow it shouldn't

3621
03:26:50,340 --> 03:26:56,520
be when i make the decision for myself it's the wrong
decision because even if you go siloed you know so i have to

3622
03:26:56,520 --> 03:27:02,000
like it's either i wait for them to tell them what to do or
i fuck up because i make the wrong decision for you to get

3623
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:02,740
value if you're old

3624
03:27:06,400 --> 03:27:07,840
I don't know.

3625
03:27:08,180 --> 03:27:09,240
It shouldn't be like that.

3626
03:27:09,360 --> 03:27:10,380
I know, but it is.

3627
03:27:10,560 --> 03:27:11,220
It is how it is.

3628
03:27:15,710 --> 03:27:17,350
I don't even know if I said next.

3629
03:27:17,770 --> 03:27:22,050
Like, it was the TP thing, and then there was, like, another
time we went into their spawn and died.

3630
03:27:22,850 --> 03:27:24,310
And then we just kept feeding Cloakwood.

3631
03:27:24,570 --> 03:27:25,730
I think we should have stayed Dive.

3632
03:27:26,190 --> 03:27:26,810
I really think that.

3633
03:27:27,190 --> 03:27:28,390
Yeah, I think so, too.

3634
03:27:28,970 --> 03:27:29,150
Yeah.

3635
03:27:29,830 --> 03:27:33,650
Well, it's after recap first, like, we just, like, walked to
their spawn and died, too.

3636
03:27:34,010 --> 03:27:36,010
But the thing is, it changes.

3637
03:27:36,250 --> 03:27:43,450
Every time I ask Wynne, who else first it's he picks it the
order changes every time the order changes every time so

3638
03:27:43,450 --> 03:27:50,750
it's like i don't know who else at that time at that point i
always have to ask to be like because she's like no i go

3639
03:27:50,750 --> 03:27:59,010
first or like you go first so the order changes every time
so that's why like i'm not confident in like establishing

3640
03:27:59,010 --> 03:28:08,850
that i alt first because it depends on the situation that
like what the what's going on next you can't stick with one

3641
03:28:08,850 --> 03:28:16,950
thing because each all is good depending on what the enemy
does or like what the plan is so that's why i always have to

3642
03:28:16,950 --> 03:28:29,070
ask because i don't know they know what the plan is um
because it depends on it depends on like what what their

3643
03:28:29,070 --> 03:28:36,130
what the plan is and that's why i always have to figure ask
first but when the fight is like all over that fight was so

3644
03:28:36,130 --> 03:28:48,510
messy that fight was so messy in general i think everyone
was all over the place meant it was fine we just needed to

3645
03:28:48,510 --> 03:28:59,750
fight better i think like they fucking made moxie swap off
like seven times i mean that's okay though yeah not really

3646
03:28:59,750 --> 03:29:08,590
what they just saved dd first they they banned they d first
by the way they bend c first we need to say yeah they give

3647
03:29:08,590 --> 03:29:15,330
us they give us gambit there's no way we can't win with
gambit we gotta oh that's what happened yesterday i mean

3648
03:29:15,330 --> 03:29:27,910
just lucky then no yeah yeah we give mantis we ban low key
we ban cloak we wait for the next game we're playing j3

3649
03:29:27,910 --> 03:29:33,150
again not j we're playing against flats again if we banned
all three supports here cloak Loki then we could have played

3650
03:29:33,150 --> 03:29:40,630
fruitful without problems it's just infinite it's just just
annoying.

3651
03:29:40,990 --> 03:29:42,930
It's draft literally we just met up yesterday

3652
03:29:48,070 --> 03:29:53,890
well I can't confirm one because like the alt is situational
that's why every time before I've always asked them who else

3653
03:29:53,890 --> 03:30:02,450
first but that entire fight was so fucking messy and like
was so fucking messy there was no time to because we're

3654
03:30:02,450 --> 03:30:03,150
always fighting.

3655
03:30:03,330 --> 03:30:04,370
We never really regroup.

3656
03:30:05,310 --> 03:30:11,330
Like, that last two minutes of fighting, the last two
minutes of fighting, literally, we never had a chance to

3657
03:30:11,330 --> 03:30:11,610
regroup.

3658
03:30:11,810 --> 03:30:16,750
We literally was just going in over and over again.

3659
03:30:17,150 --> 03:30:17,570
No, no.

3660
03:30:17,710 --> 03:30:21,710
The only force you because the enemy didn't have 5 you
players, but we have 3 teams.

3661
03:30:22,290 --> 03:30:23,310
But how much do they have?

3662
03:30:24,570 --> 03:30:25,270
They have.

3663
03:30:25,290 --> 03:30:28,370
So it's like, at that time, I didn't have time to ask
Winnie.

3664
03:30:28,850 --> 03:30:28,930
Yeah.

3665
03:30:29,770 --> 03:30:30,610
So that's 7.

3666
03:30:30,750 --> 03:30:31,930
Why are they, because they're discussing back.

3667
03:30:31,950 --> 03:30:41,850
right now the mistakes are like what i'm talking right now
doesn't matter because we're saying like oh oh you should

3668
03:30:41,850 --> 03:30:49,530
talk about like but it's like it's situational like it's not
like rank it's not like rank where i'll be like i'll first

3669
03:30:49,530 --> 03:30:55,470
whatever um in the competitive setting in a tournament
setting you can't do that it depends on what the enemy else

3670
03:30:55,470 --> 03:31:06,570
is and like what the game plan is and because i forgot i
like i'm always asking for it and it's my first time playing

3671
03:31:06,570 --> 03:31:07,650
with winnie since yesterday

3672
03:31:10,770 --> 03:31:16,950
it's winnable we just gotta lock in the next game we could
have won this game too we just needed a bit better gameplay

3673
03:31:16,950 --> 03:31:24,670
and then we win a little bit more focus from everyone a
little bit more communication you know when we do what and

3674
03:31:24,670 --> 03:31:36,450
who protects who you know if we have bubble can go deep with
cloak or not and then we're good i really think that was the

3675
03:31:36,450 --> 03:31:42,910
main thing communication even then i also kind of wanted
speedily to go uh mantis because we already had hawkeye and

3676
03:31:42,910 --> 03:31:48,790
i thought hawkeye had an opportunity to kill the cloak but i
couldn't i legit couldn't i was like legit stuck behind them

3677
03:31:48,790 --> 03:31:59,290
though you gotta look at how like they play the cloak holds
like and i'm on hawkeye it's it's yeah i mean it's like it's

3678
03:31:59,290 --> 03:32:03,270
annoying because it should at least force them to path
different then we shouldn't die to it but we still die to

3679
03:32:03,270 --> 03:32:11,470
the cloak holes like every time like it's actually so the
thing is competitive support is so different from ranked

3680
03:32:11,470 --> 03:32:20,430
support even in like land during finals or like even during
like like land and like championships they weren't playing

3681
03:32:20,430 --> 03:32:29,030
i'll give an example in sentinels kurova and aramori yeah
but i mean double all almost every fight even though they've

3682
03:32:29,030 --> 03:32:36,190
been screaming and playing together for two almost two years
or like not yours for like one plus year since the game

3683
03:32:36,190 --> 03:32:44,110
wasn't closed beta beta during the during the i think it's
better when during the land they doubled alted every time

3684
03:32:44,110 --> 03:32:54,630
the last like like they double alted so many times yet they
play together no but they can't save so many times it was a

3685
03:32:54,630 --> 03:33:04,930
huge thing yeah it just sucks because like in the moment
decision making too it wasn't even one time it was like a

3686
03:33:04,930 --> 03:33:17,810
huge thing too people were like oh oh man why did they keep
double elting you have to always like coordinate even though

3687
03:33:17,810 --> 03:33:26,470
they like yeah and it happened too to like was it to hundred
thieves team too i don't remember who their supports are but

3688
03:33:26,470 --> 03:33:32,950
like i think it was like sjp and the other support They were
double ulting all the time and they were ranked one in NA.

3689
03:33:33,450 --> 03:33:34,850
Wait, it's not over?

3690
03:33:36,310 --> 03:33:37,930
Nope, they're still on the last move.

3691
03:33:39,430 --> 03:33:41,310
Yeah, one one against Klog's team.

3692
03:33:41,570 --> 03:33:43,670
Someone updated the wrong score.

3693
03:33:44,010 --> 03:33:48,050
Someone showed like that it was Necros in loser bracket.

3694
03:33:48,930 --> 03:33:50,690
Yeah, that sucks.

3695
03:33:50,790 --> 03:33:56,850
I had two really shitty ults here too, because I was like, I
have, because I was like, I have Klogos and then I hear it's

3696
03:33:56,850 --> 03:33:57,110
fine.

3697
03:33:57,410 --> 03:34:08,390
And then in my head, I was like, I alt then i was like i
thought he meant like it's fine as in like oh why can't the

3698
03:34:08,390 --> 03:34:24,110
people just use yes no it's fine is not a good descriptor
it's so ambiguous i hear it's fine and i'm like i go in it's

3699
03:34:24,110 --> 03:34:31,590
gonna get pocketed from five 15 million years range that's
what you would like full dive is the meta bro that's just

3700
03:34:31,590 --> 03:34:40,310
how you know they're gonna have like um nexus on spidey they
only have like one dps yeah it just it's for me for me when

3701
03:34:40,310 --> 03:34:48,010
so i i got confused because it was so ambiguous so i ripped
it on triple support we're just not killing them it will

3702
03:34:48,010 --> 03:34:54,630
just not happen i think yeah maybe they just have a full
like two supports

3703
03:34:58,550 --> 03:35:07,670
I mean I think I think triple support with if we have man
you are good as long as like they don't have triple tank I

3704
03:35:07,670 --> 03:35:15,310
think triple tank is the only like really hard matchup yeah
I'll I'll tell them I'll be like I need better comms I I

3705
03:35:15,310 --> 03:35:27,310
need yes or no not it's fine see what's happening there
because play wolf on wolf sits on car and just like yeah

3706
03:35:27,310 --> 03:35:31,470
because i was like do i up just like i have all now it's
fine

3707
03:35:39,000 --> 03:35:39,880
but i'm

3708
03:35:44,310 --> 03:35:52,790
all right are they finished talking wait i want to know in
case people are like deafened or whatever all right

3709
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:06,170
all right when i say like when i say like oh should i all
right i think it's better yes or no, because I heard it's

3710
03:36:06,170 --> 03:36:06,490
fine.

3711
03:36:06,650 --> 03:36:10,950
And in my head, I was like, okay, I alt, because I thought
that meant go alt.

3712
03:36:13,250 --> 03:36:14,430
I said safe alts.

3713
03:36:14,710 --> 03:36:20,930
No, you said it's, you know, when I said, during that one
fight, I built it up just that one time.

3714
03:36:21,450 --> 03:36:24,810
And then I said, should I, do I alt it now?

3715
03:36:24,970 --> 03:36:26,030
And it's like, it's fine.

3716
03:36:26,930 --> 03:36:28,530
And then... You mean first point, right?

3717
03:36:28,690 --> 03:36:28,990
Yeah.

3718
03:36:28,990 --> 03:36:30,010
Yeah, first fight.

3719
03:36:30,070 --> 03:36:32,590
I need yes or no, because it's like ambiguous.

3720
03:36:33,130 --> 03:36:34,190
I said safe alts.

3721
03:36:34,250 --> 03:36:35,750
I was very...

3722
03:36:35,750 --> 03:36:38,130
No, I asked my chat and they said they heard it's fine.

3723
03:36:39,990 --> 03:36:41,210
I mean, I said it's fine after you.

3724
03:36:41,230 --> 03:36:44,470
I was saying it's fine maybe for like...

3725
03:36:44,470 --> 03:36:51,650
Yeah, but for me, like in the moment, I need like yes or no
is better for me because it's more direct versus like it

3726
03:36:51,650 --> 03:36:52,430
felt ambiguous.

3727
03:36:53,550 --> 03:36:55,210
Okay, we will try to say yes or no then.

3728
03:36:55,550 --> 03:36:56,810
Yeah, we can try that.

3729
03:36:57,150 --> 03:37:01,450
Then I was saying it's fine maybe because like they were
using ult and we didn't use any.

3730
03:37:01,910 --> 03:37:02,970
So we're kind of winning.

3731
03:37:03,430 --> 03:37:03,950
Yeah, that's fine.

3732
03:37:04,690 --> 03:37:06,450
No, no, that was the fight where we all died.

3733
03:37:08,270 --> 03:37:09,610
Not that it was in the winning fight.

3734
03:37:09,770 --> 03:37:12,750
We all died in the...

3735
03:37:15,270 --> 03:37:17,310
I just wanted yes or no.

3736
03:37:17,870 --> 03:37:20,290
Yeah, but Craigie's team is playing.

3737
03:37:20,650 --> 03:37:22,230
That's like the only way to live it.

3738
03:37:22,490 --> 03:37:22,990
But I feel like...

3739
03:37:22,990 --> 03:37:27,310
Because it's like in the moment, phrases like that is so
ambiguous.

3740
03:37:28,610 --> 03:37:30,210
Because it's like, do I...

3741
03:37:30,210 --> 03:37:31,050
Yeah, I don't think so.

3742
03:37:31,090 --> 03:37:31,370
Yeah.

3743
03:37:33,810 --> 03:37:35,570
And he's just gonna troll now.

3744
03:37:36,770 --> 03:37:39,190
No, I don't need ambiguous wording.

3745
03:37:39,370 --> 03:37:41,090
I need clear comms.

3746
03:37:44,530 --> 03:37:46,770
Like, look, she's gonna...

3747
03:37:47,410 --> 03:37:47,830
Oh, shit.

3748
03:37:50,610 --> 03:37:51,930
As long as they know now.

3749
03:37:53,830 --> 03:37:55,950
As long as they know now, I just don't like...

3750
03:37:55,950 --> 03:37:59,190
For me, in that moment, I can't do ambiguous comms.

3751
03:38:00,270 --> 03:38:03,030
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3752
03:38:03,270 --> 03:38:03,890
Like, just like...

3753
03:38:03,890 --> 03:38:05,690
Hey, there's no way you kill someone with...

3754
03:38:06,770 --> 03:38:12,150
man into that's what i'm saying you just see them point and
yeah they are legit but but you're gonna move the payload

3755
03:38:12,150 --> 03:38:19,010
you know like they cannot stop forever because like they're
like because like because they're pros they know when to

3756
03:38:19,010 --> 03:38:33,410
save all i don't i i know i like in the moment i don't know
if it's winnable or not i just i need that's why they're

3757
03:38:33,410 --> 03:38:41,730
like yeah but you should you should know like if it's
winnable i was like i don't i don't know i don't know all i

3758
03:38:41,730 --> 03:38:47,170
do is play rake this is different like create chances to
kill them

3759
03:38:52,090 --> 03:38:58,990
you're like suggesting all of this one yeah yeah but the
bucky is a major contributor to denying everything because

3760
03:38:58,990 --> 03:39:01,390
you shift the enemy spider-man and then he just dies

3761
03:39:04,530 --> 03:39:12,550
oh you shift the enemy and i was weird because i was like
save else i was like you didn't say that i was like when

3762
03:39:12,550 --> 03:39:22,270
wait did he actually say save us when i altered it i thought
he said it's fine oh what is this uh is this a real match no

3763
03:39:22,270 --> 03:39:33,090
no this is the last match by the to see who advances oh yeah
yeah so if karie's team win we play karie yeah yeah i see if

3764
03:39:33,090 --> 03:39:35,370
they lose No?

3765
03:39:35,750 --> 03:39:36,950
They just lose a bucket.

3766
03:39:37,310 --> 03:39:37,950
I'll lose a bucket.

3767
03:39:43,770 --> 03:39:44,910
Yeah, he said, it's fine.

3768
03:39:45,370 --> 03:39:45,710
Save up.

3769
03:39:45,870 --> 03:39:48,830
Yeah, I heard it was fine and then ripped it.

3770
03:39:49,130 --> 03:39:50,130
You could, that's what I'm saying.

3771
03:39:50,250 --> 03:39:52,550
It's better say, no, save up.

3772
03:39:54,390 --> 03:40:01,530
Because like, if you start, if they started with save up,
then I would have saved it.

3773
03:40:01,610 --> 03:40:02,370
That's the thing.

3774
03:40:03,110 --> 03:40:03,990
Clearer comms.

3775
03:40:04,370 --> 03:40:07,710
And the comms were a lot clearer and I heard save up.

3776
03:40:08,010 --> 03:40:10,190
as the first word

3777
03:40:13,250 --> 03:40:18,390
or no i hear it's fine and then i went for it

3778
03:40:27,960 --> 03:40:34,120
yeah that's why i'm saying it would be better because i
fucked up there because it's a situation right the fight is

3779
03:40:34,120 --> 03:40:40,060
going on for 15 years no one is that's why i need clear
comms because in my head i just go off i can't because like

3780
03:40:40,060 --> 03:40:50,340
hesitating is so bad too is really bad in these types of
situations so i always go off i go off with what i hear

3781
03:40:50,340 --> 03:40:57,940
first because i don't want to hesitate because if i hesitate
then we everyone dies no way he didn't he's touching now

3782
03:40:57,940 --> 03:41:09,200
five seconds too late kind of and necros just went in and
died yeah i mean yeah it's just that's why i needed the

3783
03:41:09,200 --> 03:41:17,380
clear comms because hesitation really will Also, like, I
feel bad for Moxie because they were juggling him around.

3784
03:41:19,360 --> 03:41:21,120
They're like, Moxie swap!

3785
03:41:21,500 --> 03:41:22,280
Moxie swap!

3786
03:41:22,660 --> 03:41:25,360
Moxie swap again!

3787
03:41:25,800 --> 03:41:28,000
Moxie swap to the character that's bad!

3788
03:41:29,020 --> 03:41:33,160
It's just, like, so hard because it's just every support is
OP.

3789
03:41:33,700 --> 03:41:35,200
That was pretty funny.

3790
03:41:35,560 --> 03:41:40,820
They were like, Moxie play this character that's bad, and
they told him to do it two times.

3791
03:41:41,400 --> 03:41:45,780
There's, like, six supports that are, like, And Moxie was
just like, guys, it's bad.

3792
03:41:46,220 --> 03:41:49,360
And then he had to repeat it because they're like, Moxie,
why are you not playing?

3793
03:41:49,580 --> 03:41:49,880
What was it?

3794
03:41:49,880 --> 03:41:50,360
Was it Phoenix?

3795
03:41:50,660 --> 03:41:52,880
He was like, Moxie, why aren't you playing Phoenix?

3796
03:41:53,140 --> 03:41:56,340
And then he's like, guys, Phoenix is a bad.

3797
03:42:01,280 --> 03:42:01,840
That's true.

3798
03:42:01,960 --> 03:42:03,060
You should be on spot, man.

3799
03:42:05,220 --> 03:42:07,260
That's a note of vibe that she needs to be told.

3800
03:42:07,400 --> 03:42:08,380
I'm a good soldier.

3801
03:42:08,620 --> 03:42:09,260
I guess that's true.

3802
03:42:09,940 --> 03:42:11,780
Simple thing with the Super Chat.

3803
03:42:13,480 --> 03:42:15,600
Ooh, Melio is off the map.

3804
03:42:16,060 --> 03:42:22,000
No, but we can stay like saving TV or Mantis, and then we
can run for supports against teams, no?

3805
03:42:24,800 --> 03:42:25,200
Yeah.

3806
03:42:25,760 --> 03:42:28,040
Like, if they have just, like, a super weak backline,
then...

3807
03:42:28,040 --> 03:42:29,700
Also, that Groot was not...

3808
03:42:29,700 --> 03:42:30,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3809
03:42:30,980 --> 03:42:32,800
I was just like, why didn't we...

3810
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:33,900
Everyone's like...

3811
03:42:34,400 --> 03:42:35,960
I know, there's Trash on Groot, right?

3812
03:42:35,960 --> 03:42:42,520
You fucking rat, he's like, we... I don't worry, like, don't
die, and then he chucks a Groot all, and then we still died

3813
03:42:42,520 --> 03:42:42,940
anyway.

3814
03:42:44,060 --> 03:42:51,060
it's always easier to say that afterwards yeah every cloak
would just run that one was funny i was just like why did we

3815
03:42:51,060 --> 03:43:04,000
okay i was like what wait okay yeah just because of cloak
yeah yeah i was on a phoenix yeah they actually win

3816
03:43:04,000 --> 03:43:14,440
interesting i mean why would he stay spider-man this is just
blatant win trade no it's like not even fun I mean, the game

3817
03:43:14,440 --> 03:43:15,900
they lost, the game they lost.

3818
03:43:16,120 --> 03:43:16,800
He goes Cobra.

3819
03:43:17,740 --> 03:43:18,800
Oh, look at him.

3820
03:43:19,960 --> 03:43:20,820
Yo, he heard you.

3821
03:43:20,940 --> 03:43:21,520
He heard you.

3822
03:43:21,540 --> 03:43:22,820
We're winning anyway.

3823
03:43:24,460 --> 03:43:26,800
I mean, the game they lost, he was playing.

3824
03:43:26,800 --> 03:43:28,020
Oh my god, we have to wait again.

3825
03:43:29,120 --> 03:43:30,220
Oh, I canceling the TP.

3826
03:43:30,780 --> 03:43:31,980
Oh my god.

3827
03:43:33,480 --> 03:43:34,780
It's waiting time.

3828
03:43:35,340 --> 03:43:37,660
I feel like I play a ranked game, but I don't know.

3829
03:43:37,900 --> 03:43:39,320
Just like the Spider-Man dream, though.

3830
03:43:39,400 --> 03:43:46,460
You always do nothing and then you just pull two people off
the map and you find the Let me put the text up.

3831
03:43:47,020 --> 03:43:49,240
This could be me guys, just saying I got a Spider-Man.

3832
03:43:53,500 --> 03:43:55,940
I don't want to be rage faded actually at this time.

3833
03:43:56,200 --> 03:43:58,700
I'm too annoyed to be rage faded now.

3834
03:43:58,940 --> 03:44:00,460
I got like 300 hours on the character.

3835
03:44:01,100 --> 03:44:04,040
I mean, Dennis just said, because you're not really good at
it.

3836
03:44:04,200 --> 03:44:05,560
You've seen me play one game.

3837
03:44:05,740 --> 03:44:08,080
You've seen me play one round in a ranked match.

3838
03:44:08,380 --> 03:44:09,780
Yeah, he went four and seven, I think.

3839
03:44:10,100 --> 03:44:10,880
That's who cares?

3840
03:44:11,960 --> 03:44:12,660
Oh, who cares?

3841
03:44:15,840 --> 03:44:26,640
oh my who cares i care so you're not locking spider-man in
my game that's just what it is that's how easy it is right

3842
03:44:32,570 --> 03:44:36,390
oh my god did crook win are they out

3843
03:44:40,830 --> 03:44:49,450
i think the spark chief team is out that's crazy really they
won against spark just I mean, yeah, that team legit got

3844
03:44:49,450 --> 03:44:49,940
shut on.

3845
03:44:51,610 --> 03:44:53,370
Who's on Spark Chief's team?

3846
03:44:53,690 --> 03:44:54,570
SK, I think.

3847
03:44:54,770 --> 03:44:55,650
Oh, SK.

3848
03:44:56,890 --> 03:44:58,950
Yeah, I see SK on Deadlock.

3849
03:44:59,330 --> 03:45:00,990
Sparker and Donatello.

3850
03:45:01,470 --> 03:45:01,750
That's right.

3851
03:45:02,030 --> 03:45:05,130
Our Amori can't escape if she always gets lost in these
creator tournaments.

3852
03:45:05,550 --> 03:45:06,430
I have to say it.

3853
03:45:07,070 --> 03:45:09,090
It's actually almost every single tournament.

3854
03:45:09,250 --> 03:45:10,170
So not even close.

3855
03:45:16,220 --> 03:45:17,500
It's like every single tournament.

3856
03:45:20,850 --> 03:45:21,190
Oh.

3857
03:45:21,950 --> 03:45:28,510
can we get a pull into the team here bro this is so it's i
hate spider-man for that like if i want the enemy crewed

3858
03:45:28,510 --> 03:45:35,970
here i this happens so often to me just goes from behind and
he pulls me into his team and i just don't know why i didn't

3859
03:45:35,970 --> 03:45:45,510
try it oh my god he's going full german oh my god because
he's playing spider-man here is just wrong oh my god so

3860
03:45:45,510 --> 03:45:53,150
people no no not not like the character itself i mean like
the way he's playing yeah that's a good good oh it plays it

3861
03:45:53,150 --> 03:45:59,070
no no no no he needs to pull the boot more they need to he
needs to call that they need to clear the big wall and then

3862
03:45:59,070 --> 03:46:07,570
he needs to pull the food into his team oh he was saying how
like pushing backline for the basically someone cutters mike

3863
03:46:07,570 --> 03:46:15,010
he was saying how basically every time he was our boy joins
these creative tournaments she gets last place and he was

3864
03:46:15,010 --> 03:46:26,070
just like i was like oh my god you're not supposed to say
that i was loud choke kill it and he was like it's expected

3865
03:46:26,070 --> 03:46:27,330
and i was like oh

3866
03:46:31,690 --> 03:46:43,120
could be like there's another or around the castle yeah
who's better you are maluki on that pool support i'm just

3867
03:46:43,120 --> 03:46:56,800
like oh she gave up on the hill i see oh enjoy that another
cloak bolt It's just like fucking Luna Loki meta all over

3868
03:46:56,800 --> 03:46:57,580
again.

3869
03:46:57,580 --> 03:46:58,040
Just fucking.

3870
03:46:58,240 --> 03:46:58,680
It's worse.

3871
03:46:58,900 --> 03:47:00,000
It's definitely worse.

3872
03:47:00,260 --> 03:47:01,420
Coco last longer.

3873
03:47:01,840 --> 03:47:04,240
Um, I am just a bystander.

3874
03:47:05,200 --> 03:47:06,020
You can't kill.

3875
03:47:06,100 --> 03:47:07,620
I'm just a bystander.

3876
03:47:07,680 --> 03:47:08,340
You could actually die.

3877
03:47:08,580 --> 03:47:09,300
I'm just a bystander.

3878
03:47:10,140 --> 03:47:12,620
I said, I'm reacting.

3879
03:47:13,240 --> 03:47:14,280
Now thing is also stronger.

3880
03:47:14,420 --> 03:47:15,520
So it's like even harder to die.

3881
03:47:15,640 --> 03:47:18,900
It's like, well, I'm just like, oh my god.

3882
03:47:20,900 --> 03:47:22,960
Oh, bro.

3883
03:47:23,980 --> 03:47:31,080
he's he's on hinge like such an unrewarding game like dive
is so strong in scrims and in ranked is just so bad because

3884
03:47:31,080 --> 03:47:39,640
no one can coordinate please i i didn't know they always
nerve the wrong stuff kind of i didn't know why you think

3885
03:47:39,640 --> 03:47:47,080
that like playing dive on this type of tournament is not
that i didn't i just asked who was on that team but like

3886
03:47:47,080 --> 03:47:49,260
what do we do here that's i just i was

3887
03:47:55,120 --> 03:47:58,880
Maybe like playing front to back with Hawkeye or some shit
works better.

3888
03:48:00,980 --> 03:48:04,350
I mean, I'm finding that sometimes, but like only when it's
good.

3889
03:48:05,700 --> 03:48:08,720
I know that sometimes like we should have like instantly
like winning matchups.

3890
03:48:09,160 --> 03:48:10,940
Also, I will say though.

3891
03:48:17,960 --> 03:48:23,620
I will say for a tournament that is 80% EU players.

3892
03:48:23,800 --> 03:48:26,900
Why the fuck is this tournament on NA time?

3893
03:48:29,160 --> 03:48:32,860
I think they have more EU players than NA players in this
tournament.

3894
03:48:33,360 --> 03:48:38,300
So why the fuck is this tournament at NA time slot?

3895
03:48:38,740 --> 03:48:39,880
Like 30 times and they don't die.

3896
03:48:40,100 --> 03:48:42,880
I think that's like maybe a hindsight thing.

3897
03:48:43,000 --> 03:48:43,380
I'll count.

3898
03:48:43,440 --> 03:48:44,840
I'll count the EU players right now.

3899
03:48:44,960 --> 03:48:46,260
He like perfectly comboed their back.

3900
03:48:46,280 --> 03:48:48,320
I shall count the NA players because they might be faster.

3901
03:48:49,080 --> 03:48:49,520
One.

3902
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:52,940
I guess I should have to Google this.

3903
03:48:53,860 --> 03:49:04,300
he's from even times better than like being spied all right
because i know okay yeah all right one two three four one of

3904
03:49:04,300 --> 03:49:11,060
the two things needed to happen five six seven eight i mean
cloak shift coordination is impossible in this tournament

3905
03:49:11,060 --> 03:49:20,420
nine yeah ten only last game was the first time i've seen
someone do it 11 12 13 14.

3906
03:49:20,900 --> 03:49:29,620
in this entire tournament from any team i can't lie 16, 16,
17, 18, 19.

3907
03:49:30,580 --> 03:49:34,660
That's why I think that just playing like front to back
triple support is 20, 21.

3908
03:49:35,160 --> 03:49:35,860
Okay, there's 21.

3909
03:49:36,100 --> 03:49:37,160
We made it and we lost the cloak.

3910
03:49:38,460 --> 03:49:40,680
21 players, 21 and in.

3911
03:49:42,580 --> 03:49:43,780
Just like drop the fucking cloak.

3912
03:49:43,980 --> 03:49:49,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,
11, 12, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.

3913
03:49:49,260 --> 03:49:51,500
Wow, he transformed back to Loki and he's full HP again.

3914
03:49:51,500 --> 03:49:52,620
Enjoy that, yeah.

3915
03:49:53,800 --> 03:49:59,740
one three two three and he's far away down the decade and
i'm 44 on 42 yeah four four five four six seven 48.

3916
03:50:00,220 --> 03:50:05,600
yeah there's more eu players than nna that's not bad i feel
like i don't think it's that's super good 48.

3917
03:50:05,920 --> 03:50:12,240
it's okay at least he plays yeah i feel like most of dna
players can play cap so it's like there's like only one good

3918
03:50:12,240 --> 03:50:20,840
cap player in an a i feel that good in the sense of like
they should always i unless i count it wrong i feel like

3919
03:50:20,840 --> 03:50:30,880
maybe it would have been better if at least he knows if it
was like even or because like some teams are full eu and

3920
03:50:30,880 --> 03:50:41,180
some teams are half half well if it's either like how i
don't host his tournament eu time slot or have more na

3921
03:50:41,180 --> 03:50:49,600
players in it or have more na players yeah the liquefedia
has it yeah or have more player na players in it because

3922
03:50:49,600 --> 03:50:56,160
like look it's a detriment it's more like a it's harder for
EU players to play later on.

3923
03:50:57,300 --> 03:50:57,860
Later on.

3924
03:50:57,960 --> 03:51:00,900
Because it's getting later and later for the EU players.

3925
03:51:01,380 --> 03:51:02,420
Also, I have...

3926
03:51:02,420 --> 03:51:05,580
I have four more hours to do this one.

3927
03:51:07,640 --> 03:51:10,100
This is getting close, guys.

3928
03:51:11,260 --> 03:51:12,920
This is getting real close.

3929
03:51:13,060 --> 03:51:16,900
I have four more hours to do the sponsored portion.

3930
03:51:17,100 --> 03:51:18,820
Like, look at support picks in example, right?

3931
03:51:18,880 --> 03:51:20,960
Like, we were third pick for support.

3932
03:51:21,360 --> 03:51:21,980
But, like...

3933
03:51:24,000 --> 03:51:33,020
no side but there was no crooks so it's like it's like look
at the kds on both teams and one team the game is just like

3934
03:51:33,020 --> 03:51:39,400
perfectly equal it's funny it's watching the trailer the
trailer is easy we just watch the trailer but it has to be

3935
03:51:39,400 --> 03:51:49,040
the ad like the overlay the sponsor overlay has to be on it
for one hour on dps no fletzer still in are they okay yeah

3936
03:51:49,040 --> 03:52:00,340
no i mean kingsman played really bad he just heavily
underperformed it is what it is you know if if like Kingsman

3937
03:52:00,340 --> 03:52:06,540
was the pro in the last tournament now he's just like he's
the dead weight in this tournament which is okay you know

3938
03:52:07,020 --> 03:52:14,580
just like flats he also underperformed like Terra has a
point in my opinion but of course it's like normal Delano's

3939
03:52:14,580 --> 03:52:25,760
like 40 and 4 and he's about to lose yeah he's not gonna be
happy or end he shoots the gun he cannot kill through cloak

3940
03:52:25,760 --> 03:52:31,520
yeah there's nothing like it yeah that's why that's why i
hate playing dps like on this patch like it's literally just

3941
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:38,280
like you have like a 10 second window to do any damage
before they have a cloak bubble or a cloak ult yeah most of

3942
03:52:38,280 --> 03:52:43,900
the damage is not up to you it's like still it depends on
what your supports are doing a lot you know i kind of feel

3943
03:52:43,900 --> 03:52:52,120
like that bro yeah the one has 40 and four and they're gonna
lose he's not happy they're gonna wing as of uh paramount

3944
03:52:52,120 --> 03:53:00,980
wait why did he swap wait wait i was gonna say why did why
did uh yeah i don't know i don't know we're all watching

3945
03:53:00,980 --> 03:53:10,440
necrus well now i'm watching necrus no no he swapped back
he's not back he's watching the rest of it oh my god the

3946
03:53:10,440 --> 03:53:15,380
necrus has worked now i know they definitely talk about me
behind the scenes

3947
03:53:20,120 --> 03:53:23,440
This are two flats in Aurobori.

3948
03:53:24,020 --> 03:53:25,460
No, I don't.

3949
03:53:26,140 --> 03:53:26,760
Oh, no.

3950
03:53:27,160 --> 03:53:29,280
What did they say about me?

3951
03:53:30,100 --> 03:53:31,940
Oh, he's fighting you on these lands.

3952
03:53:32,140 --> 03:53:32,580
Oh, they're winning.

3953
03:53:35,540 --> 03:53:36,260
No way.

3954
03:53:36,460 --> 03:53:38,660
What did they say about me?

3955
03:53:38,920 --> 03:53:41,240
Now they need to stall the cleric so they come back with
another cloak.

3956
03:53:41,660 --> 03:53:43,800
They have lucky compi.

3957
03:53:43,800 --> 03:53:45,740
Wait, that trade on the Desly is huge, I think.

3958
03:53:46,280 --> 03:53:46,620
They can't.

3959
03:53:46,640 --> 03:53:47,540
They don't have time.

3960
03:53:48,160 --> 03:53:49,700
They don't have time.

3961
03:53:50,120 --> 03:53:51,900
They should, no, they can, they can touch.

3962
03:53:52,180 --> 03:53:53,460
Saipa has ult though, Saipa has ult.

3963
03:53:55,560 --> 03:53:56,800
Come on, Saipa, lock in.

3964
03:53:57,500 --> 03:53:58,640
The sun has to lock in.

3965
03:54:00,360 --> 03:54:02,240
They have a, wait, what's, what character is Saipa on?

3966
03:54:02,380 --> 03:54:03,240
I wouldn't want to hear it.

3967
03:54:03,320 --> 03:54:03,920
I'd cry.

3968
03:54:04,340 --> 03:54:05,140
I'd cry.

3969
03:54:06,300 --> 03:54:09,980
They'd be like, I'm ugly cry.

3970
03:54:10,220 --> 03:54:10,940
It would be so bad.

3971
03:54:11,080 --> 03:54:13,580
I'll have to start ugly crying in the middle of the game.

3972
03:54:13,620 --> 03:54:14,260
I think the enemy team has Cloakult.

3973
03:54:15,120 --> 03:54:16,340
Yeah, I think they both have Cloakult.

3974
03:54:17,180 --> 03:54:17,800
It's over.

3975
03:54:17,940 --> 03:54:18,860

03:54:19,000 --> 03:54:20,000

I mean, on defense, we can just play like triple tank cloak.

4030
03:57:48,700 --> 03:57:48,880
Necros.

4031
03:57:49,260 --> 03:57:50,280
We lost to Necros.

4032
03:57:51,380 --> 03:57:53,240
But we beat Craigie.

4033
03:57:53,520 --> 03:57:54,780
And Craigie beat Necros.

4034
03:57:55,220 --> 03:57:57,660
So in the end, we beat Necros.

4035
03:57:58,320 --> 03:58:00,380
Oh, my God.

4036
03:58:00,480 --> 03:58:02,020

They lost the last seed.

4038
03:58:04,520 --> 03:58:06,140
We beat last seed.

4039
03:58:06,620 --> 03:58:09,640
And they lost the last seed, which means they're last seed.

4040
03:58:10,120 --> 03:58:11,020
So in the...

4041
03:58:11,020 --> 03:58:12,100

Barack Obama.

4067
04:01:43,160 --> 04:01:44,560

Herden, who was in Jane Mansfield car with Kevin Bacon.

4101
04:04:11,470 --> 04:04:12,710

50 cent was in Righteous Kill with Robert De Niro.

4106
04:04:27,720 --> 04:04:30,960

4113
04:04:48,540 --> 04:04:54,260
So it's like everybody is somehow linked to Kevin Bacon and
I was like, there's no way 50 Cent is linked to Kevin Bacon.

4114
04:04:56,020 --> 04:04:59,020
Kevin Bacon actor.

4115
04:04:59,600 --> 04:05:07,830

I think they want us to play.

4122
04:05:47,750 --> 04:05:49,730
No, no, no, just for next game.

4123
04:05:50,050 --> 04:05:51,190
I'll go next game.

4124
04:05:51,370 --> 04:05:51,430
Oh.

4125
04:05:52,550 --> 04:05:52,570
Yeah.

4126
04:05:53,090 --> 04:05:57,330
Win this one, then I'll get some monsters or something, and
I'll be back.

4127
04:05:58,950 --> 04:06:02,670
Yeah, guys, just drink infinite energy and then you pop off
as fuck, and then you win.

4128
04:06:03,010 --> 04:06:03,610
I believe that.

4129
04:06:03,770 --> 04:06:04,050
Yeah.

4130
04:06:04,790 --> 04:06:05,570
Then you die.

4131
04:06:07,750 --> 04:06:08,330
Too much.

4132
04:06:08,390 --> 04:06:08,750
For that.

4133
04:06:08,750 --> 04:06:10,810
That's the smudge and strut.

4134
04:06:11,090 --> 04:06:11,610
He used to be loose.

4135
04:06:11,610 --> 04:06:13,490
As long as it's after, it's fine, you know.

4136
04:06:13,810 --> 04:06:14,110
Yeah.

4137
04:06:16,690 --> 04:06:18,610
I mean, it's better to take no sugar.

4138
04:06:19,930 --> 04:06:20,150
Yeah.

4139
04:06:22,370 --> 04:06:28,170
It's where like people say like no sugar is like bad for
you, but I feel like it's only bad for the teeth.

4140
04:06:28,650 --> 04:06:30,590
Yeah, I think it's only bad for the teeth if anything.

4141
04:06:31,630 --> 04:06:35,870
I mean, if you have too much sugar, then like you'll be so
tired in like less than one hour.

4142
04:06:36,130 --> 04:06:36,810
Yeah, I know, I know.

4143
04:06:41,940 --> 04:06:44,800
Flora just saving Phoenix for Terra, then Swades.

4144
04:06:51,250 --> 04:06:52,750
Oh, it's going to be balanced at that time, see.

4145
04:06:57,190 --> 04:06:58,890
Yeah, but they set it up wrong.

4146
04:06:59,190 --> 04:07:00,730
I don't know how to set it up.

4147
04:07:00,730 --> 04:07:02,950
Papa Spurpa Felia, WB4, Solid.

4148
04:07:02,950 --> 04:07:03,670
She doesn't say anything.

4149
04:07:03,870 --> 04:07:05,090
Alan, dig in the super chat.

4150
04:07:05,150 --> 04:07:06,070
Thank you, thank you.

4151
04:07:06,250 --> 04:07:06,810
They just did.

4152
04:07:06,930 --> 04:07:07,250
I'm lucky.

4153
04:07:07,370 --> 04:07:09,510
Oh, we're still in the same room.

4154
04:07:10,110 --> 04:07:12,870
Oh, is we're against Greg now?

4155
04:07:13,370 --> 04:07:13,790
Oh, this is...

4156
04:07:13,790 --> 04:07:14,550
Yeah, yeah, it should be fine.

4157
04:07:14,650 --> 04:07:17,030
I mean, they're a little nervous because like last time...

4158
04:07:17,030 --> 04:07:25,630
they have more pinged on us they uh realistically he's like
they sort of figured out how to play against us so i'm a

4159
04:07:25,630 --> 04:07:39,010
little nervous we ready yep yep yeah are we ready all right
i'll type yeah let's look in oh we did beat this team

4160
04:07:39,010 --> 04:07:48,730
already in the seeds yep yeah but they sort of figured it
out uh yeah they sort of figured it out out how like comp

4161
04:07:48,730 --> 04:07:51,610
was yeah

4162
04:07:58,550 --> 04:08:08,910
we're banning venom and cap against us last time these guys
are what yeah i really think we should play more venom or

4163
04:08:08,910 --> 04:08:21,130
cap i mean if we buy low key definitely they're doing i mean
they're doing latency though zen how's that gonna be better

4164
04:08:21,130 --> 04:08:25,910
double uh i think 80 is fine i can play on an 80.

4165
04:08:26,810 --> 04:08:30,170
as long as it's not over 100 it should be good yeah i think
it's fun

4166
04:08:34,160 --> 04:08:42,360
let's see it's also like an annoying tournament system
because you can't cheese opponents by banning not banning

4167
04:08:42,360 --> 04:08:49,480
gambit you need to ban them who am i gonna banish from this
match all right no they might not ban yeah okay no they

4168
04:08:49,480 --> 04:08:56,040
don't mind they're banking now we that's the other team yeah
that's the other team are we doing for support bans this

4169
04:08:56,040 --> 04:09:03,720
guys they don't really have a dd player we do lucky clock
for sure yeah lucky cloak right now i think i i don't see we

4170
04:09:03,720 --> 04:09:09,480
do sue and cloak then maybe we let them figure it out

4171
04:09:13,220 --> 04:09:21,620
maybe they play triple support though what if they save
mantis next we are playing even at 6 8 6 p.m that's when we

4172
04:09:21,620 --> 04:09:29,800
start worrying i was not to say i'm not that's when we start
to worry That's when I might need a multi-stream.

4173
04:09:30,760 --> 04:09:32,120
I just pull up multi-stream.

4174
04:09:34,000 --> 04:09:38,600
Just be like, I'm alive on Twitch right now because I don't
want to bug up this spot.

4175
04:09:38,780 --> 04:09:39,900
Mantis look here on this map, Branker.

4176
04:09:39,960 --> 04:09:40,900
It looks scary, bro.

4177
04:09:43,120 --> 04:09:43,940
Can we just...

4178
04:09:44,420 --> 04:09:45,340
Can we play Iron Man?

4179
04:09:46,360 --> 04:09:47,120
Iron Man.

4180
04:09:47,440 --> 04:09:49,880
We will have a Hawkeye.

4181
04:09:50,340 --> 04:09:50,600
Don't worry.

4182
04:09:50,600 --> 04:09:51,620
We have a Mantis as well.

4183
04:09:53,760 --> 04:09:54,460
It's fine.

4184
04:09:54,900 --> 04:09:55,580
We have a Mantis.

4185
04:09:57,920 --> 04:10:00,540
The only thing they have is a map for Hawkeye.

4186
04:10:01,340 --> 04:10:02,300
You think they save Cloak here?

4187
04:10:02,940 --> 04:10:04,600
The map for Hawkeye is pretty mid.

4188
04:10:06,140 --> 04:10:06,500
Yeah, we're cooked.

4189
04:10:07,120 --> 04:10:08,620
They're gonna save Mantis, I'm pretty sure.

4190
04:10:09,560 --> 04:10:09,920
Yeah, they will.

4191
04:10:10,780 --> 04:10:10,960
Yeah.

4192
04:10:11,500 --> 04:10:13,020
We need to think what can destroy the Loki.

4193
04:10:14,380 --> 04:10:14,920
Kind of need it.

4194
04:10:15,620 --> 04:10:17,840
One, two, three, four.

4195
04:10:19,020 --> 04:10:20,260
Ah, fuck, man.

4196
04:10:20,380 --> 04:10:21,680
What other supports can we play?

4197
04:10:23,220 --> 04:10:24,600
One, two, three, four.

4198
04:10:24,880 --> 04:10:25,520
They're still... Don't worry.

4199
04:10:25,940 --> 04:10:29,960
As long as they keep releasing supports, I will have
supports to play.

4200
04:10:30,120 --> 04:10:31,380
Oh, ban Mantis.

4201
04:10:31,800 --> 04:10:32,440
Ban Mantis, no?

4202
04:10:33,040 --> 04:10:34,100
Yeah, I think so.

4203
04:10:34,860 --> 04:10:35,620
Yeah, ban Mantis.

4204
04:10:35,840 --> 04:10:36,480
Yeah, I need to ban it.

4205
04:10:37,200 --> 04:10:40,240
They're going to go Rocket Invis, let's just dive into W.

4206
04:10:40,260 --> 04:10:41,620
No, I think they're going to go...

4207
04:10:41,620 --> 04:10:43,020
No, no, they don't have Invis, guys.

4208
04:10:43,220 --> 04:10:44,800
They're going to go Rocket.

4209
04:10:44,900 --> 04:10:46,340
They're going to go Rocket.

4210
04:10:46,520 --> 04:10:46,800
They're going to go Rocket to now.

4211
04:10:47,220 --> 04:10:48,400
I think they're going to go dive.

4212
04:10:48,920 --> 04:10:49,920
They have no Jeff player.

4213
04:10:50,160 --> 04:10:50,720
They're going to play Jeff.

4214
04:10:51,500 --> 04:10:52,100
Oh, well.

4215
04:10:52,240 --> 04:10:52,600
Yeah.

4216
04:10:52,780 --> 04:10:53,180
Oh, no.

4217
04:10:53,700 --> 04:10:54,920
I think go Mantis, Moxley.

4218
04:10:55,100 --> 04:10:55,380
Weird.

4219
04:10:55,820 --> 04:10:57,380
We go back here?

4220
04:10:58,240 --> 04:10:59,800
I think you go Magneto.

4221
04:11:01,120 --> 04:11:04,460
No, no, no, no, I think we play Dive, but like, I think we
go...

4222
04:11:04,460 --> 04:11:05,780
Oh, you mean...

4223
04:11:05,780 --> 04:11:07,240
Hybrid Dive we play...

4224
04:11:07,240 --> 04:11:07,500
Yeah.

4225
04:11:09,720 --> 04:11:11,820
We don't have Shep, by the way, guys, so...

4226
04:11:12,800 --> 04:11:13,420
Yeah, it's fine.

4227
04:11:13,720 --> 04:11:14,440
We can still play this.

4228
04:11:14,800 --> 04:11:16,660
Just go triple with this.

4229
04:11:16,920 --> 04:11:19,480
They go Groot, we just one-shot Groot, I think.

4230
04:11:19,740 --> 04:11:23,600
I think I can actually play... I think I can play Ultron if
we play those supports.

4231
04:11:24,420 --> 04:11:24,920
Up to you guys.

4232
04:11:25,820 --> 04:11:32,660
30 seconds uh that could be good actually i think mantis all
turned pretty good too but it's up to you yeah i think dv is

4233
04:11:32,660 --> 04:11:40,360
really good this is about atoms we need it just for punish
we need it on the streets if anything i will group say for

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4237
04:12:01,940 --> 04:12:03,980
You should always try to chase into them.

4238
04:12:04,060 --> 04:12:06,380
They have Venom, they have Venom on the pillar in the
middle.

4239
04:12:06,380 --> 04:12:07,640
And then you have Starlord.

4240

04:12:24,700 --> 04:12:25,940
Angie on me, Angie on me.

Yeah, we're dead, we're dead here.

4255
04:12:32,120 --> 04:12:33,020
Rocket one, rocket one!

4256
04:12:33,760 --> 04:12:35,400

04:12:35,680 --> 04:12:37,540
Come back, go back, next slide, next slide.

4258
04:12:37,620 --> 04:12:39,020
Yeah, I'm dead.

4259
04:12:39,560 --> 04:12:40,040
Can you kill Venom?

4260
04:12:40,380 --> 04:12:40,560
I guess.

4261
04:12:40,560 --> 04:12:41,460
I can kill you in one second.

4262
04:12:42,320 --> 04:12:44,440
Yeah, I'll just pump my crew down.

4263
04:12:45,060 --> 04:12:46,080
You need to play to lift, guys.

4264
04:12:48,680 --> 04:12:49,720
There's an Angela here.

4265
04:12:50,920 --> 04:12:52,060
Can we shoot the Angela?

4266
04:12:52,760 --> 04:12:53,260
Angela half?

4267
04:12:54,700 --> 04:12:55,920
Do I have red set inside again?

4268
04:12:55,920 --> 04:12:56,320
Can he use?

4269
04:12:56,500 --> 04:12:56,740
Yeah.

4270
04:12:57,380 --> 04:12:57,580
Yep.

4271
04:12:58,520 --> 04:12:59,060
How about it?

4272
04:12:59,160 --> 04:12:59,580
Go on there, Jeff!

4273

4661
04:25:58,540 --> 04:25:58,780
I can kill.

4662
04:26:02,320 --> 04:26:03,480
You have no supports.

4663
04:26:03,940 --> 04:26:05,000

Okay, never mind.

4671
04:26:18,280 --> 04:26:19,000

I get that for you.

4674
04:26:23,300 --> 04:26:24,520
Yeah, they have no support also.

4675
04:26:26,320 --> 04:26:26,960
I'm trying.

4676
04:26:28,920 --> 04:26:29,420
I can't.

4677
04:26:30,700 --> 04:26:31,140
It's fine.

4678
04:26:31,420 --> 04:26:32,440
Roof up and go with my ult, guys.

4679
04:26:32,600 --> 04:26:33,000
No, nothing.

4680
04:26:33,100 --> 04:26:33,960
Yeah, he can just die.

4681
04:26:34,180 --> 04:26:34,620
I got that.

4682
04:26:34,620 --> 04:26:35,020
I got out.

4683
04:26:35,120 --> 04:26:35,600
Next fight, next fight.

4684
04:26:35,620 --> 04:26:36,960
Left, arm, left, they're chasing.

4685
04:26:37,440 --> 04:26:38,380
They're chasing, they're chasing.

4686
04:26:38,540 --> 04:26:39,460
I don't have anything for it.

4687
04:26:39,480 --> 04:26:39,780
The star one's left.

4688
04:26:40,340 --> 04:26:41,500
I'm trying to help you, trying to help you.

4689

04:26:42,100 --> 04:26:42,480
And you're fine.

4691
04:26:43,080 --> 04:26:44,340
I can't help them with the or push.

4692
04:26:45,640 --> 04:26:47,540
I'm gonna ult and look, hook and start some rumors again.

4693
04:26:48,020 --> 04:26:50,680
Yo, there's a venom top left, like above this door where I'm
at.

4694
04:26:50,800 --> 04:26:51,480
I'm about to hook him.

4695
04:26:51,540 --> 04:26:51,660

He's like behind the wall now.

4698
04:26:56,320 --> 04:26:56,600

4699
04:26:56,720 --> 04:26:57,660

4725
04:27:37,240 --> 04:27:38,460
We set two more supports.

4726
04:27:40,440 --> 04:27:41,620
There's a Venom 1 HP up point.

4727
04:27:41,820 --> 04:27:42,580
Venom 1 point, please.

4728
04:27:43,020 --> 04:27:45,440
Venom, Venom, help her too.

04:27:47,060 --> 04:27:47,600
Venom is one.

4730
04:27:47,620 --> 04:27:47,960
Venom's one.

4731
04:27:47,960 --> 04:27:48,720

I pushed back that, I pushed that.

4748
04:28:17,340 --> 04:28:19,080

4753
04:28:29,860 --> 04:28:30,580

4754
04:28:30,720 --> 04:28:31,460

04:28:31,480 --> 04:28:32,420
Sorry, buddy, help me, help.

4756
04:28:32,420 --> 04:28:32,620
Nice.

04:28:33,880 --> 04:28:34,780
Dude, oh my god.

4758
04:28:37,740 --> 04:28:38,880
No, AD ping is still eight.

4759
04:28:39,040 --> 04:28:43,120
It's like half of my ability is just like, oh my god.

4760
04:28:54,150 --> 04:28:56,630
Too much stuff going on.

4761
04:28:58,230 --> 04:29:02,610
Forever on that type of like front to back and they're on
Rocket Jack, like you guys should just shoot the guys in

4762
04:29:02,610 --> 04:29:04,270
front because I can just kill their backline for free.

4763
04:29:04,490 --> 04:29:17,630
he can't do anything about it yeah kind of too much stuff
going on we he got cloak i don't know jeff storm probably

4764
04:29:17,630 --> 04:29:26,270
the jeff nato it's deadly got cloak though and mila said he
could come away but he could cancel at the same moment

4765
04:29:31,630 --> 04:29:35,370
yeah see guys we get cloak can we win?

4766
04:29:47,510 --> 04:29:48,390
I'm glad.

4767
04:29:48,770 --> 04:29:50,530
I'm glad we got the first game.

4768
04:29:55,200 --> 04:29:56,200
Maybe go Groot there.

4769
04:29:56,720 --> 04:29:58,000
And we just went easier, maybe.

4770
04:29:58,780 --> 04:30:00,000
Solo with the tanks, I guess.

4771
04:30:00,640 --> 04:30:01,500
I think it was fun.

4772
04:30:01,620 --> 04:30:02,020
To have a DD.

4773
04:30:02,860 --> 04:30:03,300
Yeah.

4774
04:30:03,760 --> 04:30:05,340
I mean, DD is really good.

4775
04:30:05,740 --> 04:30:07,800
To Rockwind, I think it's literally so free.

4776
04:30:07,980 --> 04:30:09,680
Like, they don't shoot me ever.

4777
04:30:09,820 --> 04:30:20,580
They have no clue if i can't go any support it's it's so
cool now it's time to disassociate that's fine like i think

4778
04:30:20,580 --> 04:30:33,500
let them look and just like let them like look in with it
it's kind of ass no i mean we need to take mantis though

4779
04:30:33,500 --> 04:30:36,820
like we take mantis and we take cloak i'm doing that

4780
04:30:41,420 --> 04:30:42,880
should be diveable.

4781
04:30:46,100 --> 04:30:49,100
Yeah, and it's like gonna be either Alex or Maluki on on
Loki.

4782
04:30:49,420 --> 04:30:50,880
I don't think they can cook much.

4783
04:30:53,820 --> 04:30:56,540
Wait, this is the perfect face for disassociation.

4784
04:31:06,730 --> 04:31:08,030
I'm gonna go to the lobby right back.

4785
04:31:27,990 --> 04:31:28,870
Oh my god.

4786
04:31:28,930 --> 04:31:36,790
But okay, I will say I think eight teams is too many teams.

4787
04:31:39,110 --> 04:31:43,390
Eight teams might be too many teams, guys.

4788
04:31:44,300 --> 04:31:49,190
I think maybe it should be less teams.

4789
04:31:53,870 --> 04:31:56,470
Just a little too many teams.

4790
04:32:03,730 --> 04:32:06,330
Wait, Tyler, that's funny.

4791
04:32:06,870 --> 04:32:12,770
Wait, Tyler 1 was in Twitch Rivals for like, like, for one
round.

4792
04:32:12,970 --> 04:32:18,010
And then he went and booted back and he booted back League
of Legends after getting knocked out.

4793
04:32:20,550 --> 04:32:26,170
Yeah, he got knocked out in first round and he went back to
League.

4794
04:32:27,710 --> 04:32:29,210
Wait, who won the winner bracket match?

4795
04:32:29,470 --> 04:32:30,750
Probably the right amazing team, right?

4796
04:32:31,190 --> 04:32:31,410
Yeah.

4797
04:32:31,830 --> 04:32:33,630

Ooh, King's been on rocket this time.

Wait, is this the right map?

4823
04:35:35,650 --> 04:35:36,130
It's Convoy.

4824
04:35:36,370 --> 04:35:37,410
What are they talking about?

4825
04:35:37,650 --> 04:35:38,670
It's not the domination map.

4826
04:35:40,070 --> 04:35:42,030
Maybe the prod put the domination on.

4827
04:35:42,290 --> 04:35:42,390
Oh.

4828
04:35:43,590 --> 04:35:45,150
Wait, the enemy team left Cloak open.

4829
04:35:46,090 --> 04:35:46,250
Yeah.

4830
04:35:46,750 --> 04:35:47,190

4841
04:36:45,200 --> 04:36:53,700
got a little tp going or do we not have tp oh this like the
latest tp of all time they've now they know that now they

4842
04:36:53,700 --> 04:37:09,500
can't wait what they'd be taking their time oh he's at one
one what are we waiting for for everyone is hating on

4843
04:37:09,500 --> 04:37:17,840
Kingsman it's crazy the road oh wait they're asking if we're
ready oh yeah yeah they actually have a match to play shit

4844
04:37:17,840 --> 04:37:25,700
yeah I was gonna say it's like are we all just if all teams
just watching this yeah I was like we guys we still have one

4845
04:37:25,700 --> 04:37:33,040
more game I was just like, guys, why are we like watching a
game right now?

4846
04:37:34,280 --> 04:37:37,840
We still have one for a game.

4847
04:37:38,920 --> 04:37:39,680
Yeah, that, yeah.

4848
04:37:41,080 --> 04:37:44,320
I feel like if cloak is open, you just need like way too
much things to go.

4849
04:37:44,340 --> 04:37:48,880
I'm just like, what am I waiting for?

4850
04:37:49,400 --> 04:37:52,580
Like, it like tabbed and I was like, wait a minute.

4851
04:37:53,060 --> 04:37:55,740
Why is nobody fucking saying art?

4852
04:37:57,960 --> 04:38:02,700
Now the best is when there's like a cloak bubble and an
invis shield like stack on top of each other and it's

4853
04:38:02,700 --> 04:38:04,000
basically like a Luna ult.

4854
04:38:05,400 --> 04:38:07,360
And then they gain all their ult charge.

4855
04:38:27,890 --> 04:38:29,490
There's no way they put him on Raccoon.

4856
04:38:32,650 --> 04:38:33,070
Tonight.

4857
04:38:33,810 --> 04:38:35,290
But they put the Legion Kingsman.

4858
04:38:36,910 --> 04:38:37,490
Oh my god.

4859
04:38:37,690 --> 04:38:39,290
Holy shit, sit down kid.

4860
04:38:39,770 --> 04:38:40,350
You guys saw that?

4861
04:38:40,910 --> 04:38:41,270
Yeah.

4862
04:38:43,050 --> 04:38:44,470
Oh, Millennia's a wolf.

4863
04:38:44,790 --> 04:38:46,790
Oh, there goes his passive.

4864
04:38:48,770 --> 04:38:49,810
You're not going to get water.

4865
04:38:50,690 --> 04:38:51,790
If I can get water.

4866
04:38:52,150 --> 04:38:54,570
I ran out again, I'll be your bat.

4867
04:38:55,870 --> 04:38:57,910
Terra with Mantis token should be illegal.

4868
04:38:58,450 --> 04:38:59,870
I think it's something that should not get out.

4869
04:39:07,990 --> 04:39:12,490
It's just like boring to play wolf against champs like sewer
thing.

4870
04:39:13,090 --> 04:39:14,210
That's like the main thing.

4871
04:39:26,240 --> 04:39:26,860
I'm starting.

4872
04:39:27,440 --> 04:39:28,300
Oh, we're starting, yeah.

4873
04:39:28,800 --> 04:39:29,580
Need poly leveling.

4874
04:39:31,100 --> 04:39:33,760
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

4875
04:39:34,000 --> 04:39:35,600
Wait, we picked attack.

4876
04:39:36,840 --> 04:39:37,100
Yeah.

4877
04:39:40,500 --> 04:39:41,780
Redo map.

4878
04:39:42,640 --> 04:39:43,320
Or bust.

4879
04:39:54,120 --> 04:39:55,380
I'm here.

4880
04:39:56,940 --> 04:39:57,940
Oh, shit.

4881
04:39:59,180 --> 04:39:59,500
What?

4882
04:40:00,460 --> 04:40:01,940
What happened?

4883
04:40:04,300 --> 04:40:05,580
Why would you pause?

4884
04:40:06,500 --> 04:40:09,100
Bro, Kruk is more on defense instead of attack.

4885
04:40:09,760 --> 04:40:11,360
Yeah, we picked attack.

4886
04:40:15,520 --> 04:40:17,020
Why did they pass?

4887
04:40:18,900 --> 04:40:20,140
So he'd be on the other side.

4888
04:40:20,560 --> 04:40:21,440
Can they see the chat?

4889
04:40:22,540 --> 04:40:25,920
I think we might have to mention them on this course.

4890
04:40:27,900 --> 04:40:29,460
Wait, who's our referee?

4891
04:40:30,640 --> 04:40:32,280
I think it's Ailey.

4892
04:40:33,080 --> 04:40:35,920
It's the Barry at B-E-R-I.

4893
04:40:43,110 --> 04:40:53,170

4897
04:41:41,490 --> 04:41:47,550

help were buried Yes Yeah, we can do that if anything.

4898
04:41:48,330 --> 04:41:49,410
He's losing, I think.

4899
04:41:49,690 --> 04:41:52,610
That was a limp-ass combo that I just saw.

4900
04:41:52,630 --> 04:41:54,350
Yay, they fixed it.

4901
04:41:55,770 --> 04:41:56,650
Limp-ass.

4902
04:41:57,010 --> 04:41:58,230
King's been on magic.

4903
04:42:00,170 --> 04:42:02,150
Wait, did he let him play magic?

4904
04:42:02,950 --> 04:42:03,790
He's 4-5.

4905
04:42:04,850 --> 04:42:05,730
Oh, no.

4906
04:42:06,410 --> 04:42:08,550
I'm going to open up Terra's chat.

4907
04:42:09,730 --> 04:42:10,350
Last fight.

4908
04:42:10,530 --> 04:42:11,970
Oh, last fight, one team has...

4909
04:42:11,970 --> 04:42:13,550
Last fight, one team has Cloak ult.

4910
04:42:13,670 --> 04:42:14,350
Let's see how this goes.

4911
04:42:16,450 --> 04:42:17,590
Oh, no.

4912
04:42:17,870 --> 04:42:19,290
Whoa, that's a little early, buddy.

4913
04:42:20,430 --> 04:42:21,470
Oh, never mind.

4914
04:42:23,130 --> 04:42:24,290
I'm so delayed.

4915
04:42:25,170 --> 04:42:26,570
Damn, they played that fight really well.

4916
04:42:26,790 --> 04:42:29,110
They used Cloak and walked forward and killed everyone.

4917
04:42:31,590 --> 04:42:33,250
Wait, it's winnable.

4918
04:42:34,750 --> 04:42:35,330
TP back?

4919
04:42:35,830 --> 04:42:37,630
Oh, are you ready?

4920
04:42:38,750 --> 04:42:38,990
Yeah.

4921
04:42:41,150 --> 04:42:45,510
Oh, my gosh.

4922
04:42:46,270 --> 04:42:57,810
those stats are not great how do you know he's not happy i
can see it in the space they're probably gonna go i don't

4923
04:42:57,810 --> 04:43:01,010
know i think we just go same and dive i think so too

4924
04:43:08,600 --> 04:43:21,080
what if this was like um okay or is it called like a lot
illuminati shit like bogey planted

4925
04:43:24,900 --> 04:43:25,860
for kingsman

4926
04:43:29,780 --> 04:43:38,240
they're gonna go bucky i think now i don't know why they
didn't play last game they're playing star diddy and star

4927
04:43:38,240 --> 04:43:46,740
and then it's a conspiracy it's a conspiracy theory maybe
don't bend this term why does he rise and downfall no i've

4928
04:43:46,740 --> 04:43:51,560
been in cloak and mental If they save Invis here, if they
save Mantis, I'm going to Cloak and Invis.

4929
04:43:52,000 --> 04:43:52,260
Oh!

4930
04:43:53,100 --> 04:43:53,980
Oh, they figured it out!

4931
04:43:54,680 --> 04:43:56,600
This is like all of these streams, right?

4932
04:43:57,000 --> 04:43:57,320
Yeah.

4933
04:43:57,540 --> 04:43:59,040
Maybe we should have moved the comms here.

4934
04:43:59,320 --> 04:43:59,460
Yeah.

4935
04:44:00,240 --> 04:44:01,620
I think Ban Loki for sure.

4936
04:44:01,820 --> 04:44:02,660
I don't want to go Cloak.

4937
04:44:03,220 --> 04:44:04,560
Yeah, do Ban Loki first.

4938
04:44:04,980 --> 04:44:05,120
Yeah.

4939
04:44:05,860 --> 04:44:07,500
And then I think we ban...

4940
04:44:08,460 --> 04:44:08,900
Mantis?

4941
04:44:09,740 --> 04:44:10,660
Mantis or Invis?

4942
04:44:11,020 --> 04:44:11,340
No, no.

4943
04:44:11,820 --> 04:44:13,120
I think it has to be Invis.

4944
04:44:14,260 --> 04:44:17,400
I think it's Invis too, because we already have Loki banned
from Mantis.

4945
04:44:17,500 --> 04:44:20,680
Ben and this Ben and this.

4946
04:44:20,700 --> 04:44:21,220
Are you sure?

4947
04:44:21,420 --> 04:44:22,100
They run Mantis.

4948
04:44:22,220 --> 04:44:23,820
I think it's fine too for me.

4949
04:44:24,000 --> 04:44:25,140
Lucky we can just go Hawkeye.

4950
04:44:25,520 --> 04:44:27,200
We go Hawkeye.

4951
04:44:27,400 --> 04:44:29,640
Yeah, they go Triple Support, which is much the Triple
Support move.

4952
04:44:31,000 --> 04:44:31,180
Yeah.

4953
04:44:31,820 --> 04:44:33,220
They're figuring, they're cooking.

4954
04:44:34,260 --> 04:44:35,040
And I exist.

4955
04:44:35,360 --> 04:44:37,860
They need to ban Mantis here, I think.

4956
04:44:38,480 --> 04:44:39,360
Yeah, we save it, I think.

4957
04:44:39,500 --> 04:44:40,540
Yeah, we save Mantis here.

4958
04:44:40,640 --> 04:44:43,500
If we play Triple and Hawkeye, I think I'll play fucking...

4959
04:44:45,280 --> 04:44:46,560
I actually think we ban Phoenix.

4960
04:44:47,500 --> 04:44:56,860
no they banned cloak they figured it out i mean i can ban
mentus now and then they have to play like rocket cloko i

4961
04:44:56,860 --> 04:45:04,440
think they run lentus it's fine for arkai so that's just
they're going to be on triple with uh they're going to be on

4962
04:45:04,440 --> 04:45:11,880
triple i think like triple support with like make his cloak
rocket or something same thing but now we can go phoenix

4963
04:45:11,880 --> 04:45:17,800
they can't but we don't really need to go so they're buying
chat they might buy an invid's no No, I think they lose

4964
04:45:17,800 --> 04:45:18,060
Jeff.

4965
04:45:20,700 --> 04:45:22,680
I think they don't know how to play against Jeff, really.

4966
04:45:22,680 --> 04:45:24,400
Oh, I couldn't.

4967
04:45:26,340 --> 04:45:26,700
Bad.

4968
04:45:27,120 --> 04:45:30,540
Oh, I mean, yeah, for the club.

4969
04:45:32,000 --> 04:45:33,240
I think we go full dive, honestly.

4970
04:45:34,060 --> 04:45:34,200
Yeah.

4971
04:45:34,680 --> 04:45:37,140
I don't see how they stop Rocket Jeff, honestly.

4972
04:45:37,320 --> 04:45:40,520
We could also go, we could also go bunker with Cluck and
Mantis.

4973
04:45:40,540 --> 04:45:41,320
We're attacked, though.

4974
04:45:42,160 --> 04:45:45,000

I think we are Angela too, no.

5144
04:52:36,690 --> 04:52:36,770
No.

5145
04:52:37,010 --> 04:52:37,450
Taylor's too good.

5146
04:52:38,810 --> 04:52:45,400

I'm trying to.

5150
04:53:09,390 --> 04:53:09,930
I have mine.

5151
04:53:10,070 --> 04:53:10,470
I have mine.

5152
04:53:10,630 --> 04:53:10,810
I'm out of the way.

5153
04:53:10,950 --> 04:53:12,890
We have so much time!

5154
04:53:12,910 --> 04:53:14,130
We have costing.

5155
04:53:15,310 --> 04:53:15,710
I'm touching.

5156
04:53:15,710 --> 04:53:16,950
Can you live it?

5157
04:53:17,050 --> 04:53:18,330
Can you live it?

5158
04:53:18,450 --> 04:53:18,670
I'm dying.

5159
04:53:19,270 --> 04:53:21,550
I'm on the old.

5160
04:53:21,710 --> 04:53:22,130
I live.

5161
04:53:22,850 --> 04:53:23,110
I got two.

5162
04:53:23,510 --> 04:53:24,490
I got you.

5163
04:53:24,490 --> 04:53:24,950
Just survive.

5164
04:53:25,110 --> 04:53:25,950
You only have Jeff.

5165
04:53:27,370 --> 04:53:28,210
Can you get it?

5166
04:53:31,010 --> 04:53:33,450
Do we have TP?

5167
04:53:35,910 --> 04:53:41,290
You're UTP Doki, UTP, oh, I don't, wait, I already have alt
though.

5168
04:53:42,530 --> 04:53:42,650
Yeah.

5169
04:53:44,190 --> 04:53:48,270
The current score is 1, 2, 0.

5170
04:53:50,790 --> 04:53:53,910
Time to switch things up, including which side you're on.

5171
04:53:54,390 --> 04:53:55,190
Angela's doing too much, DAP.

5172
04:53:55,330 --> 04:53:56,890
You need to go Angela too, I think, in this matchup.

5173
04:53:57,750 --> 04:54:00,510
I don't see I can play Angela in too torrent luck, you know?

5174
04:54:01,090 --> 04:54:02,450
You can't do any damage with Emma.

5175
04:54:03,070 --> 04:54:03,230
No?

5176
04:54:03,450 --> 04:54:05,170
Then go for yourself in this matchup.

5177
04:54:05,390 --> 04:54:07,310
I think Thor is probably better.

5178
04:54:08,710 --> 04:54:10,150
I think we go bunker.

5179
04:54:10,350 --> 04:54:11,250
I actually think we bunker.

5180
04:54:11,630 --> 04:54:13,010
Yeah, I think we go bunker with Dp.

5181
04:54:14,090 --> 04:54:18,070
We just have to carry the bunker with the global Dp.

5182
04:54:18,930 --> 04:54:22,630
I think we just go with this again, I think.

5183
04:54:22,810 --> 04:54:23,510
We don't want Alan.

5184
04:54:24,870 --> 04:54:26,370
Why don't we not play Mantis?

5185
04:54:26,990 --> 04:54:27,390
There we go.

5186
04:54:27,550 --> 04:54:29,610
Adam and Envis the rocket, huh?

5187
04:54:29,770 --> 04:54:30,030
Right.

5188
04:54:30,850 --> 04:54:32,010
Yeah, I think stay rocket.

5189
04:54:32,210 --> 04:54:32,750
I think stay rocket.

5190
04:54:34,050 --> 04:54:37,330
I also think you should stay stiff, anonymously.

5191
04:54:38,110 --> 04:54:38,830
Yeah, where do I go?

5192
04:54:39,250 --> 04:54:39,310
Yeah.

5193
04:54:39,730 --> 04:54:41,270
Just stay this, just stay this, this is okay.

5194
04:54:41,650 --> 04:54:42,210
This is fine, no?

5195
04:54:42,570 --> 04:54:42,710
Yeah.

5196
04:54:42,730 --> 04:54:43,330
Just play it normally.

5197
04:54:43,570 --> 04:54:43,990
Just play it normally.

5198
04:54:45,630 --> 04:54:50,770
No, bait them to think we're playing like three times, even
though they walk on a storm on the way of the D.

5199
04:54:51,570 --> 04:54:52,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5200
04:54:52,850 --> 04:54:54,770
I'm gonna play main and brawl tanks because we have Mantis.

5201
04:54:56,130 --> 04:54:57,210
So let's go save Asgard.

5202
04:54:57,370 --> 04:54:58,910
Are we spot holding or are we like holding this oneer?

5203
04:55:00,090 --> 04:55:01,310
Uh, they're playing Punisher.

5204
04:55:01,530 --> 04:55:03,430
I don't think I can play that.

5205
04:55:03,450 --> 04:55:03,890
points

5206
04:55:08,690 --> 04:55:19,950
I think we do play the point side okay okay okay spawn new
damage tree damage tree yep yep can lift can lift yeah yeah

04:55:36,430 --> 04:55:38,350
We should be able to get two fights still.

5210
04:55:38,470 --> 04:55:39,630
Angela up off.

5211
04:55:40,150 --> 04:55:40,730

Yeah, we're getting the one.

5560
05:08:17,620 --> 05:08:18,340
We're getting the one.

5561
05:08:18,740 --> 05:08:19,700
Who's on KG's team?

5562
05:08:19,780 --> 05:08:20,820
That was the team we scrimmed.

5563
05:08:20,880 --> 05:08:22,840
Andrew, Ragero, crisis.

5564
05:08:23,360 --> 05:08:24,700
That's the team we scrimmed.

5565
05:08:25,540 --> 05:08:26,420
I see, I see.

5566
05:08:27,060 --> 05:08:28,020
Yeah, the guy was scrimmed.

5567
05:08:29,340 --> 05:08:30,520
You want me to watch that, right?

5568
05:08:30,740 --> 05:08:31,620
Just force them on the KG.

5569
05:08:31,620 --> 05:08:32,260
Just the cap.

5570
05:08:32,460 --> 05:08:33,380
I can do it.

5571
05:08:33,880 --> 05:08:34,280
Wait.

5572
05:08:35,560 --> 05:08:38,240
Do you do the animation cancel on controller, or is it like
impossible?

5573
05:08:38,540 --> 05:08:46,440
no i think i did i tried to whenever yeah it's very slow
animation cancel all right you know what i won this game so

5574
05:08:46,440 --> 05:08:55,360
i'm treating myself with a cough drop can be a lot faster
treat yourself with a cush good treat yourself with a cop

5575
05:08:55,360 --> 05:09:05,840
wait does that mean i have i'm higher rate than than crooks
team now oh no i need one of my friends

5576
05:09:08,960 --> 05:09:13,200
Oh, no, he might go come over and beat him up.

5577
05:09:13,380 --> 05:09:15,100
I feel like you stacked the ults really poorly.

5578
05:09:15,960 --> 05:09:18,360
Like, here we stacked our ults really badly.

5579
05:09:18,600 --> 05:09:19,480
Even you were ults early.

5580
05:09:19,820 --> 05:09:20,800
Like, really early.

5581
05:09:20,840 --> 05:09:22,720
Why did she play like this at J3?

5582
05:09:23,040 --> 05:09:27,120
I just used when they started using storm and punish her.

5583
05:09:27,200 --> 05:09:28,040
But it was, I wouldn't have used.

5584
05:09:28,300 --> 05:09:29,840
But look, the problem is now we got it.

5585
05:09:30,140 --> 05:09:36,160
And, like, yeah, because of this situation, now you've got
like, normally what I would want, I would want everyone to

5586
05:09:36,160 --> 05:09:36,500
fight here.

5587
05:09:36,540 --> 05:09:37,940
I'm actually doing well now.

5588
05:09:38,560 --> 05:09:47,160
we can't do that so capital is the bare minimum but i have
to use my my and i have to pay the attention from him by

5589
05:09:47,160 --> 05:09:54,280
staying inside of him he's gonna give you guys right so this
is like all risky i would rather play the fight slow and

5590
05:09:54,280 --> 05:10:01,940
then have after yeah i have infinite or you have like three
gauge yeah and i have 40 damage reduction if i press e so i

5591
05:10:01,940 --> 05:10:07,900
will not die but like i want to keep the cooldowns for after
the cloak ends right obviously so it's like it's annoying

5592
05:10:07,900 --> 05:10:14,160
that i have to use it here oh yeah i mean they just turned i
mean look how much we used right and he just insta died he

5593
05:10:14,160 --> 05:10:21,440
was still into he was still he still had the look how much
damage he just took oh i got him just a few misses just

5594
05:10:21,440 --> 05:10:32,180
insta kill him it's so crazy oh if i hit better here we just
win lobbies up yeah lobbies runs through and just dies i see

5595
05:10:32,180 --> 05:10:42,180
that i mean overall it's okay you know Just important to
prioritize if we if we have cap, you know, and they use

5596
05:10:42,180 --> 05:10:48,280
cloacled we just need to kite and you just touch Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, and then we're fine Like I can also say when I

5597
05:10:48,280 --> 05:10:54,580
can touch or not if I have sword ult then I can touch but
otherwise I don't want to Well, what did I do?

5598
05:10:54,680 --> 05:10:55,100
What did I do?

5599
05:10:56,080 --> 05:10:59,160
You just walked into the enemy team and died with mantis ult
up.

5600
05:10:59,440 --> 05:11:04,800
That's like illegal It is pretty illegal Well, what was
that?

5601
05:11:04,900 --> 05:11:05,940
I thought the angel ulted me

5602
05:11:27,890 --> 05:11:39,390
i'm gonna start this all right disassociating tab yay all
right guys i need a disassociate guys in between games thank

5603
05:11:39,390 --> 05:11:52,750
you i'm gonna find the password would i have you added
anybody yeah you invited me before no not last in fact not

5604
05:11:52,750 --> 05:11:55,730
second last in fact not even third last

5605
05:11:59,470 --> 05:12:11,510
pack average that's what i like to see when it's really does
so much on that pool it's actually insane that pool no that

5606
05:12:11,510 --> 05:12:21,730
ever i mean that pool it's always the same like it's both
middle of the pack let's go you know how it is lowest ranked

5607
05:12:21,730 --> 05:12:30,530
player in this entire tournament but yet not last a win.

5608
05:12:32,850 --> 05:12:38,430
Might be the lowest ranked player, but yet I am not last.

5609
05:12:39,370 --> 05:12:43,410
I always feel like if I would lowest ranked captain in this
tournament.

5610
05:12:44,370 --> 05:12:45,250
Might I add?

5611
05:12:46,110 --> 05:12:46,130
Clots.

5612
05:12:46,590 --> 05:12:47,690
Let's take the best one.

5613
05:12:48,070 --> 05:12:48,630
Might I add.

5614
05:12:49,390 --> 05:12:53,410
Clots or don't go Prime Sinatra or anyone that is like a
really good aimer.

5615
05:12:53,810 --> 05:12:56,690
Then I feel like the character has infinite potential.

5616
05:12:58,410 --> 05:13:03,990
I don't think Gail has that super crazy aim like i i would
compare gale to quartz and quartz is just infinitely better

5617
05:13:03,990 --> 05:13:12,590
it's like not even close oh my manager sent me like how much
money i'm gonna get for flat it's like here's the

5659
05:19:44,840 --> 05:19:54,740

strategies and bands It's like brain empty No thoughts

5660
05:19:54,740 --> 05:20:01,340
inside I just try to stay alive As long as

5661
05:20:04,510 --> 05:20:12,190
They tell me to go rock You're like what's the game plan
Should be set up I'm like muted in the discord you'll hear

5662
05:20:12,190 --> 05:20:19,370
each other through the vmix cool oh wait we'll hear each
other through the what is this website called the oh the

5663
05:20:19,370 --> 05:20:23,550
vmix okay yeah all right so make sure the tab is unmuted

5664
05:20:31,300 --> 05:20:37,080
okay it's 3 30 a.m and i'm getting frightened we have three
more matches and the last match will be a best of five so

5665
05:20:37,080 --> 05:20:46,140
i'm gonna be awake until 8 a.m so hopefully we get going as
soon as possible But before that, we are going to have an

5666
05:20:46,140 --> 05:20:50,280
interview with Ms. Doki and who, Andrew?

5667
05:20:52,100 --> 05:20:52,600
Is it Andrew?

5668
05:20:53,720 --> 05:20:54,500
I don't know.

5669
05:20:54,540 --> 05:20:54,900
I believe so.

5670
05:20:55,320 --> 05:20:56,020
I think Andrew.

5671
05:20:56,460 --> 05:20:57,500
It's going to be Andrew, correct.

5672
05:20:57,980 --> 05:21:04,940
So, both teams have had a very good run today, even though
they were the worst performing teams in the third round.

5673
05:21:04,960 --> 05:21:05,840
What the fuck?

5674
05:21:06,080 --> 05:21:10,700
And now they are getting closer and closer to the finals.

5675
05:21:11,040 --> 05:21:12,220
And that's when it comes out.

5676
05:21:12,340 --> 05:21:20,120
that the winner of this team didn't have to mention that a
second time because team kaiji kaiji won the tournament last

5677
05:21:20,120 --> 05:21:28,300
time would trust me so whoever wins here they might get a
chance to win the booger bash back to back um we weren't

5678
05:21:28,300 --> 05:21:39,440
last seed and the lower bracket run would go crazy so i am
hyped are you hyped cozy yes yes the more booger bash

5679
05:21:39,440 --> 05:21:45,900
stories that we have the more you know the more vogue rashes
we have the more stories that were unfold and what a great

5680
05:21:45,900 --> 05:21:51,400
one in front of our eyes right now i'm impressed with how
both these teams have bounced back and once you've touched

5681
05:21:51,400 --> 05:21:58,260
the heat man you just you just keep going here as we see in
the lower so excited to interview them are they uh are we

5688
05:22:40,440 --> 05:22:47,880

mostly our pros uh trust me speedily they're like this is

5689
05:22:47,880 --> 05:22:53,680
the game plan and then they'll start discussing the
strategies and the banning phase and then i'll be

disassociating pulling up twitter and doom scrolling and

05:23:11,900 --> 05:23:13,160
But they're focused.

5694
05:23:13,520 --> 05:23:15,120
I'm also focused.

5695
05:23:16,000 --> 05:23:18,160
And I'm surprised we're all the way here.

5696
05:23:18,560 --> 05:23:19,980
But yay, we're here.

5697
05:23:21,980 --> 05:23:22,380
Wonderful.

5698
05:23:23,180 --> 05:23:25,220
I mean, you guys have had a really good run.

5699
05:23:25,480 --> 05:23:26,420
Really good run today.

5700
05:23:26,800 --> 05:23:28,080
But so has Team Kaiji.

5701
05:23:28,740 --> 05:23:30,280
Andrew, are you feeling confident?

5702
05:23:30,580 --> 05:23:32,580
You guys have had a crazy run so far.

5703
05:23:33,760 --> 05:23:34,680
Yeah, it's pretty good.

5704
05:23:34,760 --> 05:23:35,100
It's pretty good.

5705
05:23:35,120 --> 05:23:35,780
I'm just tired.

5706
05:23:36,040 --> 05:23:36,720
I'm so tired.

5707
05:23:36,840 --> 05:23:37,380
Are you tired?

5708
05:23:37,480 --> 05:23:38,700
I think we're all tired here.

5709
05:23:38,820 --> 05:23:39,180
Like what?

5710
05:23:39,200 --> 05:23:39,980
What changed, bro?

5711
05:23:40,060 --> 05:23:40,620
What changed?

5712
05:23:40,880 --> 05:23:42,720
That one win against NecroSteam.

5713
05:23:43,160 --> 05:23:44,100
That really flipped things.

5714
05:23:44,160 --> 05:23:45,240
Yeah, I told you I'm going to win.

5715
05:23:45,280 --> 05:23:46,420
It was a super-pitched game ever.

5716
05:23:47,880 --> 05:23:50,320
And also, this guy delayed the whole thing.

5717
05:23:50,660 --> 05:23:51,920
Can we cancel this guy, by the way?

5718
05:23:52,020 --> 05:23:52,640
Can we cancel this guy?

5719
05:23:52,740 --> 05:23:54,080
He delayed the whole thing.

5720
05:23:54,320 --> 05:23:55,660
Okay, we're not sorry.

5721
05:23:55,780 --> 05:23:56,120
No, we're not sorry.

5722
05:23:56,580 --> 05:23:57,660
Make a video.

5723
05:23:57,660 --> 05:24:00,360
Get the editors in right now.

5724
05:24:01,060 --> 05:24:01,800
Make the video.

5725
05:24:03,180 --> 05:24:05,620
Long story short, he delayed the whole thing by two hours.

5726
05:24:05,820 --> 05:24:07,720
I have to make a nice two-hour-long video now, right?

5727
05:24:09,340 --> 05:24:17,540
questions for them or are they free they are free I want to

5736
05:25:51,100 --> 05:25:58,940

5737

okay all right lock in yep we got this we can win we can win

5740
05:26:57,490 --> 05:27:04,370
ah These guys are actually all beatable.

5741
05:27:04,650 --> 05:27:06,190
I think we just need to abuse their weakness.

5742
05:27:07,590 --> 05:27:10,790
Just abuse the fact they have why Andrew and Tank, I think.

5743
05:27:11,710 --> 05:27:17,390
Just go something that punishes him like will flow with a
thing or Angela that can grab him and won't show them

5744
05:27:17,390 --> 05:27:19,010
anything that punishes stuff.

5745
05:27:19,170 --> 05:27:19,990
I think we need to play.

5746
05:27:20,450 --> 05:27:21,430
This is like a very good team.

5747
05:27:21,570 --> 05:27:22,850
They have like five players that are great.

5748
05:27:23,970 --> 05:27:24,910
It's gonna be hard to win.

5749
05:27:25,310 --> 05:27:25,750
Oh no.

5750
05:27:26,610 --> 05:27:27,470
There it is.

5751
05:27:27,970 --> 05:27:28,590
There it is.

5752
05:27:28,870 --> 05:27:29,350
My headphone.

5753
05:27:29,990 --> 05:27:39,590
first then no all right it's back to 80 in the mic sorry
yeah but like still annoying where would they do that beyond

5754
05:27:39,590 --> 05:27:50,770
north virginia it would not do it though it is it is north
virginia but it's just balancing yeah i know it's like 80 is

5755
05:27:50,770 --> 05:28:02,330
fine it's fine it's fine finishing the system huh

5756
05:28:05,630 --> 05:28:19,530
Yeah, we're ready in the freaking...

5757
05:28:20,690 --> 05:28:21,570
Yeah, we're ready.

5758
05:28:21,870 --> 05:28:22,530
Yeah, we're ready.

5759
05:28:23,910 --> 05:28:27,670
I swear everyone is trying to bait me with my past, but I'm
not letting it get to me.

5760
05:28:29,210 --> 05:28:30,570
It will not happen.

5761
05:28:34,740 --> 05:28:36,760
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

5762
05:28:38,060 --> 05:28:39,920
I think there's a venom first.

5763
05:28:43,890 --> 05:28:44,310
Broly.

5764
05:28:45,050 --> 05:28:45,270
Broly.

5765
05:28:46,690 --> 05:28:54,690
we just do the support bans no yeah they get cloaked out of
the game oh wait i'm leaving you need that then gambit

5766
05:28:54,690 --> 05:29:05,570
gambit not cloaked yeah then give it there's one more
support that's better than cloak actually just saying did

5767
05:29:09,720 --> 05:29:20,000
you save i actually think here do we want to save dd because
i feel like this is like a matchup where we want a wolf and

5768
05:29:20,000 --> 05:29:26,780
and thing right I could also yeah also if they bandy I can
just go I actually think save Mantis yeah save Mantis I

5769
05:29:26,780 --> 05:29:28,820
actually think that's better right now

5770
05:29:37,970 --> 05:29:47,930
ideally we ban either low-care or if they save low-care
cloak I mean to ban the other one yeah yeah I think so sure

5771
05:29:51,120 --> 05:29:57,140
and it's not the way around we have to do it that way I
think we meant to slam ban last though I think we should

5772
05:29:57,140 --> 05:30:04,080
have done it on this path to Mantis ban instead of what did
we ban Phoenix Phoenix I think we should have done Mantis

5773
05:30:04,080 --> 05:30:04,540
ban instead.

5774
05:30:04,880 --> 05:30:13,020
Okay, this is great ban ban Loki cloak Or we know not maybe
not Loki I'll look low first and then we can think yeah

5775
05:30:13,020 --> 05:30:18,060
Okay, do we go in this cloak Go cloak Ban cloak guaranteed.

5776
05:30:18,380 --> 05:30:23,900
I think we have to you know, you know, then the thing is
annoying Ban cloak ban mantis ban cloak trusted ban cloak

5777
05:30:23,900 --> 05:30:24,520
ban mantis.

5778
05:30:24,680 --> 05:30:38,220
Okay The thing with like Loki is okay okay wait let me think
yeah it's okay yeah it's okay i think loki isn't it i don't

5779
05:30:38,220 --> 05:30:42,580
even think they're banning dd but if they do like it's just
annoying if i have to deal with lamps on starlight or

5780
05:30:42,580 --> 05:30:49,700
something last thing last thing we can ban we can ban
anything don't forget that i think this looks like a dd safe

5781
05:30:49,700 --> 05:31:00,140
to be honest to me yeah we can ban phoenix we can ban Invis
or Loki, you know, I think here, to me, this looks like a

5782
05:31:00,140 --> 05:31:00,520
Phoenix ban.

5783
05:31:01,940 --> 05:31:02,260
Phoenix?

5784
05:31:02,540 --> 05:31:04,800
I think it's the most like ban, you know?

5785
05:31:05,680 --> 05:31:06,280
What else can we ban?

5786
05:31:06,540 --> 05:31:07,300
I think it's good, too.

5787
05:31:07,380 --> 05:31:07,920
I think it's good, too.

5788
05:31:08,460 --> 05:31:09,740
We can ban Groot if we want.

5789
05:31:10,060 --> 05:31:11,400
That's also, but they won't play Groot.

5790
05:31:11,640 --> 05:31:14,400
Groot is only good on, like, it should be only decent on
like one map.

5791
05:31:14,860 --> 05:31:15,580
Yeah, get rid of Phoenix.

5792
05:31:15,940 --> 05:31:17,200
Yeah, yeah, I think that's a good ban.

5793
05:31:18,160 --> 05:31:18,520
Save.

5794
05:31:19,260 --> 05:31:19,620
Save.

5795
05:31:20,240 --> 05:31:21,280
TD, maybe?

5796
05:31:21,720 --> 05:31:22,140
Did you grow?

5797
05:31:22,240 --> 05:31:23,340
Wait, I just realized.

5798
05:31:23,340 --> 05:31:33,200
Necro's team was the one where they did the stupid swap
captain and Venom swap shit and then yeah and then they got

5799
05:31:33,200 --> 05:31:46,920
last oh my god we did we beat the system we did it it didn't
matter round robin never matters yes round robin doesn't

5800
05:31:46,920 --> 05:32:08,940

5887
05:35:05,940 --> 05:35:13,240
are we just dedocing every opponent or what's i'm not even
gonna lie i'm getting dedoc like my like this is crazy ping

5888
05:35:13,240 --> 05:35:19,380
80 from like the last game yeah it's probably the balance
thing it's bugged yeah also i'm better either backline i

5889
05:35:19,380 --> 05:35:25,520
don't think i don't think they can dodge this i think they
have name or spoon yeah yeah no no i beveled the mooks

5890
05:35:28,620 --> 05:35:34,920
maybe maybe venom is better i don't i don't think they have
name more they just use name more before whitipit yeah maybe

5891
05:35:34,920 --> 05:35:43,640
i think they close to copy and close to vd venom yeah we
don't have any support rewards dude it's like dude i'm not

5892
05:35:43,640 --> 05:35:50,440
gonna lie this map is so a Heather's venom like if she can
never kill this guy like she's just a boy I think you can go

5893
05:35:50,440 --> 05:35:58,420

press team up and their venom is useless yeah yeah you can

the venom right now anyways yeah oh oh never mind all right

kind of want to to get ability first did they throw 800 hp

don't think they have lamps either i don't think they have

5901
05:36:45,180 --> 05:36:51,960
lamps either what's the situation looking like for you guys
guys guys listen isn't maybe possible to turn around and

5902
05:36:51,960 --> 05:36:58,180
look at dd there's a dd alone like behind us on the part of
the point moxie if you look at my pov i'm literally like one

5903
05:36:58,180 --> 05:37:06,040

are living in the back line right yeah yeah we're sure yeah

5906
05:37:19,880 --> 05:37:25,900
can you guys walk forward then for us okay yeah we can yeah
okay good i maybe need like one leave or something behind

5907
05:37:25,900 --> 05:37:31,460
because we need to kill now they don't have anything they're
gonna get no no no they have they used they used they used

5908
05:37:31,460 --> 05:37:39,240
dd they should have support right and uh only one no they
use one too they use one too they also use naval they don't

5909
05:37:39,240 --> 05:37:46,080
have that yeah they have nothing i think they only have one
support yeah but i'm about to eye the sue i don't have

5910
05:37:46,080 --> 05:37:51,260
either you guys need a shooter i don't have my e i hope it
now he gets time to react to it and poop you you know i hope

5911
05:37:51,260 --> 05:37:56,960
that doesn't happen i think i'm praying i don't think he has
it are you you been on them for a while they probably used

5912
05:37:56,960 --> 05:37:59,100
to see these cities by now yeah probably probably probably

5913
05:38:04,260 --> 05:38:14,620
oh my god he's not back yet yeah tain is gonna come back in
like 10 minutes 10 minute and we win by forfeit really yeah

5914
05:38:20,660 --> 05:38:28,700
really is that true i mean there's only 10 minutes no no it
is it is it's only 10 minutes oh my god Okay.

5915
05:38:31,040 --> 05:38:31,920
Let's hope.

5916
05:38:33,940 --> 05:38:35,640
I just need to play better and we win.

5917
05:38:35,940 --> 05:38:36,860
I think that's just about it.

5918
05:38:37,200 --> 05:38:37,260
Let's hope.

5919
05:38:38,020 --> 05:38:39,740
Then the tournament will end sooner.

5920
05:38:40,060 --> 05:38:41,060
I actually think I go Venom though.

5921
05:38:41,280 --> 05:38:43,320
I think I'm a little worried that I might not.

5922
05:38:43,440 --> 05:38:44,180
I believe in you so much, Spidly.

5923
05:38:44,280 --> 05:38:46,240
You're just going to gap Malenia so hard.

5924
05:38:46,380 --> 05:38:49,060
I'm a little bit concerned about the sponsor.

5925
05:38:50,520 --> 05:38:55,920
You can sit in the pillar in the middle for five years,
install the point and like have every dive angle.

5926
05:38:56,460 --> 05:38:56,860
Yeah, I know.

5927
05:38:58,720 --> 05:38:59,160
Yeah.

5928
05:39:00,040 --> 05:39:00,080
Okay.

5929
05:39:00,100 --> 05:39:02,180
I also think that my ult can one-shot through.

5930
05:39:02,580 --> 05:39:04,660
Like, it's more consistent than playing this matchup.

5931
05:39:04,680 --> 05:39:05,900
They only have two supports.

5932
05:39:08,160 --> 05:39:10,100
You'll also have Mantis damage boost.

5933
05:39:11,960 --> 05:39:13,320
Oh, my God.

5934
05:39:15,620 --> 05:39:16,880
Oh, she's back.

5935
05:39:17,080 --> 05:39:17,580
She's back.

5936
05:39:19,660 --> 05:39:20,560
I mean, Sven.

5937
05:39:21,200 --> 05:39:22,020
All right, he's back.

5938
05:39:22,280 --> 05:39:22,500
All right.

5939
05:39:22,620 --> 05:39:24,080
So we're pushing backline.

5940
05:39:24,920 --> 05:39:25,040
Yeah.

5941
05:39:25,340 --> 05:39:25,720
Yeah.

5942
05:39:25,960 --> 05:39:27,320
Make sure we kill this too.

5943
05:39:27,520 --> 05:39:28,920
We can actually kill this too.

5944
05:39:29,000 --> 05:39:29,580

5960
05:41:38,160 --> 05:41:38,620

5961
05:41:40,860 --> 05:41:41,900
Moxie's back now.

5962
05:41:42,780 --> 05:41:44,500
I have ult and I've only 90 90.

5963
05:41:46,340 --> 05:41:46,980
I can't stop.

5964
05:41:49,320 --> 05:41:49,860
I can't.

5965
05:41:49,860 --> 05:41:50,220
I can't stop.

5966
05:41:52,040 --> 05:41:53,700
We can commit cloak as well to start.

5967
05:41:53,880 --> 05:41:54,580
I can't, I can't, I can't.

5968
05:41:54,700 --> 05:41:55,880
Do I have the computer?

5969
05:41:55,900 --> 05:41:56,660

Here, I'm okay.

5974
05:42:02,840 --> 05:42:03,620
They used Invis.

5975
05:42:03,960 --> 05:42:06,740
They only have Cop, here and there are Volvos.

5976
05:42:07,840 --> 05:42:08,820
They have Walls, man.

5977

Okay, I'm fine.

5984
05:42:20,540 --> 05:42:23,100
He can fight him.

5985
05:42:23,500 --> 05:42:24,360
I'm going to go back out on him.

5986
05:42:24,520 --> 05:42:25,600

Okay, I got you.

5988
05:42:26,760 --> 05:42:27,120
Wapping.

05:42:27,560 --> 05:42:27,780
Walk in.

5990
05:42:28,000 --> 05:42:28,520
Oh, wait!

5991
05:42:28,620 --> 05:42:28,940
I'm dead.

5992
05:42:29,280 --> 05:42:29,460

5993
05:42:29,640 --> 05:42:29,960

5994
05:42:30,140 --> 05:42:30,300
I'm back.

5995
05:42:33,220 --> 05:42:34,700
I need to chill.

5996
05:42:34,860 --> 05:42:35,020
Need to chill.

5997
05:42:35,200 --> 05:42:35,880
Fault on me.

5998
05:42:39,500 --> 05:42:40,420
No passive, no passive.

5999
05:42:40,520 --> 05:42:40,900
You can't kill.

6000
05:42:40,960 --> 05:42:41,420
Chill, chill.

6001
05:42:41,760 --> 05:42:42,520

6002
05:42:42,640 --> 05:42:42,740

05:42:44,260 --> 05:42:44,620
Venom on, Venom on.

6005
05:42:46,180 --> 05:42:47,420
I can maybe grab here.

6006
05:42:48,180 --> 05:42:48,500
Grab bag?

6007
05:42:49,820 --> 05:42:50,140
Okay.

05:42:52,340 --> 05:42:52,880
We can walk through.

6011
05:42:52,880 --> 05:42:53,800
Can we push the neighbor?

6012
05:42:54,160 --> 05:42:54,500
What is our neighbor?

6013
05:42:54,740 --> 05:42:55,360
What is our neighbor?

6014
05:42:55,600 --> 05:42:56,960
Run it down, Mantis, I think.

05:42:56,960 --> 05:42:57,240
Yeah.

05:42:57,300 --> 05:42:58,220
Yeah, can you go?

6017
05:42:58,260 --> 05:42:58,800

No lamps, no lamps, no lamps, no lamps.

No key, no key.

6024
05:43:07,160 --> 05:43:08,220
Kill, kill, kill.

6025
05:43:08,820 --> 05:43:09,460
Oh, no, no, no, biggie, biggie.

Nice, nice.

6028
05:43:13,000 --> 05:43:13,820
There's a Neymar in point.

6029
05:43:13,880 --> 05:43:14,880
Neymar in point.

6030
05:43:16,200 --> 05:43:16,580
Neymar in point.

6031
05:43:17,040 --> 05:43:17,180
Don't die.

6032
05:43:17,660 --> 05:43:18,220
Let me kill Neymar.

6033
05:43:18,440 --> 05:43:19,960
Okay, we can kill Neymar in point.

6034
05:43:20,480 --> 05:43:20,940
I'm killing back.

6035
05:43:21,040 --> 05:43:21,300
I'm killing back.

6036
05:43:21,300 --> 05:43:23,160
Venom Venom Venom Venom Venom on me.

6037
05:43:23,180 --> 05:43:23,680
They don't have TP.

6038
05:43:23,840 --> 05:43:24,100
It's last.

6039
05:43:24,140 --> 05:43:25,080
Go early with my heroes.

6040
05:43:25,260 --> 05:43:25,260
Okay.

6041
05:43:25,400 --> 05:43:26,140
Go early with my heroes.

Yes, yes.

6052
05:43:34,160 --> 05:43:34,380
Can we go soon?

6053
05:43:34,440 --> 05:43:36,040
Three, two, one.

6058
05:43:51,300 --> 05:43:51,820
Blinded Venom.

6059

6067
05:44:03,620 --> 05:44:04,120

I'm on him.

6070
05:44:05,680 --> 05:44:05,780
He's one.

6072
05:44:06,960 --> 05:44:07,600

Walk in Meg.

05:44:37,040 --> 05:44:37,080
The more one.

6098
05:44:37,080 --> 05:44:37,440
Can you live?

6099
05:44:37,540 --> 05:44:37,820
Can you live?

6100
05:44:38,040 --> 05:44:38,440
I don't know.

6101
05:44:38,740 --> 05:44:39,820
I'm trying, trying, trying to live.

6102
05:44:40,940 --> 05:44:41,440
I'm almost black.

6103
05:44:41,560 --> 05:44:43,300
I live though, but...

6104
05:44:45,180 --> 05:44:45,720
I got Magra.

6105
05:44:46,020 --> 05:44:46,040
I got you.

6106
05:44:47,060 --> 05:44:47,740
I got you.

6107
05:44:47,760 --> 05:44:48,520
I got you.

6108
05:44:48,520 --> 05:44:48,880
I got you.

6109
05:44:49,300 --> 05:44:49,780
I got you.

6110
05:44:49,780 --> 05:44:49,940
I'm okay.

6111
05:44:51,900 --> 05:44:53,560
Yeah, kill everyone at first except Venom.

6112
05:44:53,560 --> 05:44:54,600
Look, he won him!

6113
05:44:55,420 --> 05:44:55,640
Look him!

6114
05:44:55,920 --> 05:44:56,020
Look him!

6115
05:44:56,020 --> 05:44:56,280
Look him!

6116
05:44:56,280 --> 05:44:57,660
No support.

6117
05:44:57,880 --> 05:44:58,660
No support.

6118
05:44:58,940 --> 05:45:00,020
I got you, I got you.

6119
05:45:00,180 --> 05:45:01,000
Venom, Venom won!

6120
05:45:01,160 --> 05:45:01,800
Venom actually won!

6121
05:45:03,040 --> 05:45:03,160
Nice.

6122
05:45:03,520 --> 05:45:07,360
Yo, by the way, even when it's like a 6v4, we can't kill
Venom, bro.

6123
05:45:07,500 --> 05:45:09,720
It's like you have to kill the rest of their team.

6124
05:45:10,460 --> 05:45:13,360
I legit can't, I can't even touch the Venom.

6125
05:45:13,420 --> 05:45:14,440
I mean, the cardboard is done.

6126
05:45:14,660 --> 05:45:15,020
Unless I hook him.

6127
05:45:15,480 --> 05:45:15,680
Yeah.

6128
05:45:15,880 --> 05:45:16,080
Yeah.

6129
05:45:17,080 --> 05:45:20,320
But I'm sorry, if it's not 6v1, there's no need to look at
him, lazy.

6130
05:45:21,300 --> 05:45:22,520
He's not even trying to kill you guys.

6131
05:45:22,600 --> 05:45:23,560
He's trying to stall off like.

6132
05:45:24,080 --> 05:45:24,540
It's fine.

6133
05:45:28,440 --> 05:45:29,260
I don't even know what.

6134
05:45:29,680 --> 05:45:30,680
Did they use it?

6135
05:45:31,560 --> 05:45:32,660
They used Venomous.

6136
05:45:32,980 --> 05:45:33,620
They used Skull PC.

6137
05:45:33,620 --> 05:45:34,800
I kind of want to play to react.

6138
05:45:34,960 --> 05:45:35,540
I kind of want to...

6139
05:45:35,540 --> 05:45:37,300
If they got Divers, we can push with Mantis ult.

6140
05:45:37,400 --> 05:45:38,280
Otherwise, we chill, okay?

6141
05:45:38,540 --> 05:45:38,800
Okay.

6142
05:45:39,000 --> 05:45:39,420
We can play with...

6143
05:45:39,420 --> 05:45:41,080
We can play Aggro with Speed ult, though.

6144
05:45:41,320 --> 05:45:42,120
I really want to do it.

6145
05:45:42,340 --> 05:45:43,480
I want to try to go early with mine.

6146
05:45:43,740 --> 05:45:44,360
We go bottom.

6147
05:45:44,400 --> 05:45:45,060
We go bottom, though.

6148
05:45:45,180 --> 05:45:46,100
I really think we go bottom.

6149
05:45:46,220 --> 05:45:47,940
Because if they drop on us, we just Mantis ult, okay?

6150
05:45:48,800 --> 05:45:49,120
Yeah.

6151
05:45:50,040 --> 05:45:50,800
Yeah, that's fine.

6152
05:45:51,040 --> 05:45:52,660
I'm pretty sure they have like 6th on Lunas.

6153
05:45:52,760 --> 05:45:54,720
but I'm not sure why you're gonna keep Luna.

6154
05:45:54,940 --> 05:45:55,880
They probably are so Luna.

6155
05:45:56,480 --> 05:45:56,960
They don't have Luna.

6156
05:45:57,560 --> 05:45:58,340
They did.

6157
05:46:00,420 --> 05:46:01,620
They low key copied.

6158
05:46:03,080 --> 05:46:05,280
I don't think he got Luna though, if he don't swap.

6159
05:46:07,120 --> 05:46:09,840
Go bottom, go bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom,
bottom.

6160
05:46:10,640 --> 05:46:12,860
I want to build from slope.

6161
05:46:14,300 --> 05:46:14,980
We can walk up.

6162
05:46:15,360 --> 05:46:16,480
Just walk forward, just walk forward.

6163
05:46:16,580 --> 05:46:17,860
If they did just man this one.

6164
05:46:18,200 --> 05:46:18,840
I'm on this water.

6165
05:46:19,080 --> 05:46:21,180
Can you damage me?

6166
05:46:21,520 --> 05:46:21,980
Can you damage me?

6167
05:46:22,900 --> 05:46:23,620
You're damaged.

6168
05:46:23,980 --> 05:46:24,240
Two.

6169
05:46:24,840 --> 05:46:25,020
One.

6170
05:46:25,540 --> 05:46:26,580
Going in.

6171
05:46:26,680 --> 05:46:27,040
Eying.

6172
05:46:27,620 --> 05:46:28,180
Oh, he got back.

6173
05:46:28,560 --> 05:46:29,500
Back, back, back, back, back, back.

6174
05:46:29,500 --> 05:46:30,500
He can't, he can't get down.

6175
05:46:30,620 --> 05:46:30,880
He's down.

6176
05:46:31,220 --> 05:46:31,260
Yeah.

6177
05:46:31,680 --> 05:46:32,000
Oh, still.

6178
05:46:32,640 --> 05:46:33,000
Fuck.

6179
05:46:33,200 --> 05:46:33,860
Oh, one.

6180
05:46:33,880 --> 05:46:36,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

6181
05:46:36,840 --> 05:46:37,640
I can't live.

6182
05:46:38,620 --> 05:46:38,920
Oh, I can't live.

6183
05:46:38,920 --> 05:46:43,520
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

6184
05:46:43,820 --> 05:46:45,140
Okay, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill,
chill, slow, slow, slow, slow.

6185
05:46:46,180 --> 05:46:47,240
No, no, no, you can't.

6186
05:46:48,600 --> 05:46:49,500
I can't live.

6187
05:46:51,160 --> 05:46:51,340
Oh.

6188
05:46:51,720 --> 05:46:52,260
I can't live.

6189
05:46:52,260 --> 05:46:53,140
I got pushed.

6190
05:46:53,520 --> 05:46:53,920
Oh my god.

6191
05:46:54,300 --> 05:46:56,780
I mean, we're Venomous on back, so I'm...

6192
05:46:56,780 --> 05:46:58,580
I said when they push into us, we just walk forward.

6193
05:46:58,840 --> 05:46:59,480
It's fine, though.

6194
05:46:59,560 --> 05:47:00,180
Just wait, just wait.

6195
05:47:00,440 --> 05:47:00,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6196
05:47:01,480 --> 05:47:02,540
They don't have a lot against it.

6197
05:47:02,580 --> 05:47:03,880
We can just always stop on the back lane.

6198
05:47:04,020 --> 05:47:05,200
Let's go top above them, okay?

6199
05:47:05,560 --> 05:47:06,200
Top above them.

6200
05:47:06,380 --> 05:47:06,820
Here's the way.

6201
05:47:07,440 --> 05:47:08,080
I'm looking back.

6202
05:47:08,280 --> 05:47:10,280
Back, back, back, back, back in, back in, back in.

6203
05:47:10,280 --> 05:47:10,700
All right, ult him.

6204
05:47:11,280 --> 05:47:11,940
No bubble, no bubble.

6205
05:47:12,280 --> 05:47:12,640
I can't.

6206
05:47:13,000 --> 05:47:15,000
I can look back, but chill, just chill, just chill, just
chill.

6207
05:47:15,240 --> 05:47:15,560
Wait, my cooldown.

6208
05:47:15,700 --> 05:47:16,380
Go right, go right.

6209
05:47:16,400 --> 05:47:16,600
Go right.

6210
05:47:17,060 --> 05:47:17,600
I'm going right.

6211
05:47:18,100 --> 05:47:18,580
Make them flip.

6212
05:47:18,840 --> 05:47:19,680
They have no hook.

6213
05:47:19,680 --> 05:47:20,200
Good after.

6214
05:47:21,180 --> 05:47:21,760
Yeah, yeah.

6215
05:47:21,760 --> 05:47:22,360
I'm going all the way by.

6216
05:47:22,640 --> 05:47:22,720
Okay.

6217
05:47:23,940 --> 05:47:27,080
I got you.

6218
05:47:27,420 --> 05:47:30,140
I got you.

6219
05:47:37,040 --> 05:47:37,540
I got you.

6220
05:47:37,760 --> 05:47:38,620
I need all.

6221
05:47:41,900 --> 05:47:42,160
Nice.

6222
05:47:43,360 --> 05:47:44,500
No more, no, sorry.

6223
05:47:44,840 --> 05:47:45,760
I was one HP.

6224
05:47:46,040 --> 05:47:46,700
I met this one.

6225
05:47:47,440 --> 05:47:48,280
I met this one.

6226
05:47:48,500 --> 05:47:48,520
I...

6227
05:47:50,820 --> 05:47:51,180
standen

6228
05:47:58,980 --> 05:47:59,340
Good.

6229
05:47:59,340 --> 05:48:01,740
It's good.

6230
05:48:02,120 --> 05:48:03,520
It's good.

6231
05:48:03,600 --> 05:48:06,240
We need to wait footholds.

6232
05:48:06,380 --> 05:48:07,040
We need to wait for it.

6233
05:48:07,600 --> 05:48:08,060
Play slow.

6234
05:48:08,480 --> 05:48:09,020
No support.

6235
05:48:09,220 --> 05:48:09,980
I will control the yeller.

6236
05:48:10,140 --> 05:48:10,800
Just come top Moxy.

6237
05:48:10,980 --> 05:48:11,240
Come top.

6238
05:48:11,400 --> 05:48:12,880
Help me control it.

6239
05:48:13,000 --> 05:48:13,480
I need control.

6240
05:48:13,780 --> 05:48:14,060
Just go in.

6241
05:48:19,800 --> 05:48:21,260
How did we play this weight pretty slow?

6242
05:48:21,660 --> 05:48:23,120
Can we just kill that kid?

6243
05:48:23,120 --> 05:48:23,460
I'm on Venom.

6244
05:48:23,620 --> 05:48:24,400
Venom Choline.

6245
05:48:24,500 --> 05:48:25,580

6246
05:48:25,660 --> 05:48:25,740
Venom.

6247
05:48:26,260 --> 05:48:26,420
Venom.

6248
05:48:26,980 --> 05:48:27,580

05:48:29,600 --> 05:48:30,440

05:48:31,040 --> 05:48:31,640
Ah, we are down!

05:48:32,320 --> 05:48:33,300
Drop it, HP!

6256
05:48:34,000 --> 05:48:34,480

05:50:06,880 --> 05:50:07,160
Look inside.

6332
05:50:07,540 --> 05:50:08,360

6333
05:50:08,380 --> 05:50:09,360

Look your point.

6338
05:50:12,840 --> 05:50:14,960
No support.

6339
05:50:15,080 --> 05:50:15,400
No support.

6340
05:50:15,600 --> 05:50:15,820
Look at that.

6341
05:50:18,660 --> 05:50:19,580

I'm full HP.

6346
05:50:53,160 --> 05:50:53,700
Raccoon legit.

6347
05:50:54,000 --> 05:50:54,280
Back smooth.

6348
05:50:55,180 --> 05:50:55,540
I need care.

6349
05:50:55,540 --> 05:50:55,940
I need care now.

6350
05:50:56,000 --> 05:50:56,320
I'm trying.

6351
05:50:56,660 --> 05:50:57,160
Trust me.

6352
05:50:57,260 --> 05:50:57,460
I'm back.

6353
05:50:57,520 --> 05:51:00,480
I got hit.

6354
05:51:00,760 --> 05:51:01,080
I got hit.

6355
05:51:01,160 --> 05:51:01,800
I got hit.

6356
05:51:01,940 --> 05:51:02,200
I got hit.

6357
05:51:02,880 --> 05:51:03,080
I'm okay.

6358
05:51:03,180 --> 05:51:03,640
I'm okay.

6359
05:51:03,860 --> 05:51:10,320
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk,
walk, walk, walk, think that, think that, think that.

6360
05:51:11,400 --> 05:51:13,280
Siler, Siler, Siler's up, Siler's up, Siler's up.

6361
05:51:13,700 --> 05:51:14,020
Nice.

6362
05:51:14,780 --> 05:51:15,400
Good job, guys.

6363
05:51:15,620 --> 05:51:16,000
No, no, no.

6364
05:51:16,220 --> 05:51:17,180
Nice one.

6365
05:51:17,960 --> 05:51:18,640
Bro, why do you need someone?

6366
05:51:18,660 --> 05:51:31,600
fucking carrying holy shit everything is a win god what are
you they use they use yeah yeah that boy say black bus up

6367
05:51:31,600 --> 05:51:39,000
then there's no way i have a good old 20.

6368
05:51:40,520 --> 05:51:41,360
all your bubble men

6369
05:51:44,950 --> 05:51:52,990
all right i'll be repaired i need to go toilet oh my god i
want to go bathroom break too all right i'll be right back i

6370
05:51:52,990 --> 05:51:58,370
got it do bathroom break that's one guys you carried that
game i played chit i'll play by the next game and then it's

6371
05:51:58,370 --> 05:52:04,050
not even close the unkillable venom strikes again

6372
05:52:16,690 --> 05:52:23,290
i don't think venom can get value though in rather than
selling points into our comp yeah not yeah not really it's a

6373
05:52:23,290 --> 05:52:27,210
selling point it's annoying every con is just like fan was
against that

6374
05:52:55,270 --> 05:53:02,090
yeah dude there's like this aids bug in the game where like
if a loki copies i can't use my my f like my mark yeah yeah

6375
05:53:02,090 --> 05:53:03,350
it's actually so annoying

6376
05:53:20,380 --> 05:53:35,020
all right i'm back i'm back no i'm still baby i'm still baby
all right here we go again

6377
05:53:38,440 --> 05:53:46,660
every game i feel like i'm so tired Every game, I'm like,
I'm tired.

6378
05:53:46,680 --> 05:53:48,360
We should probably take a brief first, though.

6379
05:53:48,900 --> 05:53:50,140
Have a chulipit.

6380
05:53:52,240 --> 05:53:53,880
Man, let's see what the map they pick.

6381
05:54:08,590 --> 05:54:09,790
Probably, uh...

6382
05:54:09,790 --> 05:54:10,430
You want Midtown?

6383
05:54:20,340 --> 05:54:21,940
That's disassociation time.

6384
05:54:32,290 --> 05:54:33,690
Midtown, Midtown, Midtown.

6385
05:54:34,350 --> 05:54:37,690
Yeah, it's going to be a triple matchup, annoyingly.

6386
05:54:39,250 --> 05:54:40,130
Or we go full dive.

6387
05:54:40,550 --> 05:54:41,570
We kind of need Jeffy.

6388
05:54:42,890 --> 05:54:43,450
Maybe?

6389
05:54:44,170 --> 05:54:44,990
Or, I don't know.

6390
05:54:45,610 --> 05:54:48,470
If they have, if they have, like, dang group or some shit.

6391
05:54:48,730 --> 05:54:50,050
I zero believe in Punisher.

6392
05:54:50,330 --> 05:54:51,650
If anything, they save Cloak.

6393
05:54:52,090 --> 05:54:52,570
Then we go.

6394
05:54:52,890 --> 05:54:53,410
Oh my God.

6395
05:54:53,530 --> 05:54:54,930
Guys, look at this.

6396
05:54:56,130 --> 05:54:57,790
The progression of Leon.

6397
05:54:58,290 --> 05:55:01,130
He just keeps wearing smaller shirts.

6398
05:55:01,210 --> 05:55:01,790
Just one thing.

6399
05:55:02,510 --> 05:55:03,710
Look at this.

6400
05:55:04,830 --> 05:55:06,150
Yeah, it's not reliable.

6401
05:55:06,630 --> 05:55:09,630
The older he gets, the tighter the shirts.

6402
05:55:12,030 --> 05:55:13,170
These guys don't have group players.

6403
05:55:13,370 --> 05:55:13,990
We don't need to worry.

6404
05:55:14,510 --> 05:55:16,950
Like if Rajaro goes crude, he's just going to get walled by
me.

6405
05:55:17,590 --> 05:55:18,590
We want to attack, right?

6406
05:55:19,210 --> 05:55:19,810
Yeah, we want to.

6407
05:55:19,870 --> 05:55:21,390
I think attack is much better.

6408
05:55:21,870 --> 05:55:26,670
I think because I clicked on my algorithm is literally just
Leon now.

6409
05:55:26,890 --> 05:55:31,030
I clicked on so many fucking Leon toys for you guys.

6410
05:55:31,470 --> 05:55:33,070
I had to show you guys.

6411
05:55:33,490 --> 05:55:34,270
Got my tires.

6412
05:55:34,310 --> 05:55:41,690
my algorithm is like half of talking about leon his buff
fucking his buff arms he's scared

6413
05:55:45,650 --> 05:55:54,050
it's so funny to me game four crisis he did you did have
aura that game though we wanted to put him in after game two

6414
05:55:54,050 --> 05:56:06,770
but like but like multiple issues yeah yeah yeah yeah i do
it for the people it's for the people so good into jeff and

6415
05:56:06,770 --> 05:56:11,670
we lost to full dive jeff every single game oh man in words

6416
05:56:15,380 --> 05:56:24,720
this will never happen again talking about the atlanta
grandfather i was so annoyed oh you're complaining you don't

6417
05:56:24,720 --> 05:56:33,900
know what i had to deal with i was told dive was the worst
comp in the game i mean it's an a you know like as hard as

6418
05:56:33,900 --> 05:56:40,100
it sounds it feels it feels no i literally agree with you
it's just na like na players don't want to play dives ever

6419
05:56:40,100 --> 05:56:47,540
for some reason yeah it's true it's only front to back no
yeah na just loves playing support front to back pockets

6420
05:56:47,540 --> 05:57:01,480
playing yeah they only play dive honestly yeah and a also
has like one dive tank player i think literally yeah spark

6421
05:57:01,480 --> 05:57:09,600
chief kind of yeah spark chief literally and windows is a of
everything he can play he can play everything but like

6422
05:57:09,600 --> 05:57:17,800
nothing really well kind of that's like the biggest problem
to it yeah oh

6423
05:57:30,980 --> 05:57:36,180
we're bringing this home if we win this game we're bringing
this home guys we're not lacking a lot of money speedy

6424
05:57:36,180 --> 05:57:44,820
speedily he missed a class for this i don't know you know
maybe yoga gym class with the ladies or any class i don't

6425
05:57:44,820 --> 05:57:50,100
know what class might have been One class.

6426
05:57:50,500 --> 05:57:51,700
Damn right.

6427
05:57:52,740 --> 05:57:53,420
What's how this?

6428
05:57:54,380 --> 05:57:56,960
Yes, he missed one class.

6429
05:57:57,360 --> 05:57:58,000
Wait, you missed a class?

6430
05:57:58,240 --> 05:57:58,280
Real?

6431
05:57:59,100 --> 05:58:01,000
Yeah, I skipped it for it to play this.

6432
05:58:01,240 --> 05:58:01,880
What class?

6433
05:58:02,200 --> 05:58:03,000
What is it?

6434
05:58:04,160 --> 05:58:05,440
Uh, some like CS class.

6435
05:58:06,060 --> 05:58:06,580
Oh, it's fine.

6436
05:58:06,720 --> 05:58:07,540
You can just Google that.

6437
05:58:07,720 --> 05:58:09,420
But it's like, but it's also like the second day.

6438
05:58:09,620 --> 05:58:10,840
So there's like not too much happening.

6439
05:58:11,300 --> 05:58:12,300
He will help you out, bro.

6440
05:58:12,540 --> 05:58:17,800
Just write an entire algorithm with Chechibity and stuff.

6441
05:58:19,860 --> 05:58:21,460
Here it is.

6442
05:58:21,520 --> 05:58:21,760
Yeah.

6443
05:58:22,620 --> 05:58:25,220
Guys, I didn't want to break it to him.

6444
05:58:25,480 --> 05:58:26,920
Like he was like, yeah, it was some CS class.

6445
05:58:27,100 --> 05:58:31,340
I didn't want to say, you know, I didn't want to say it, but
then trust me, I ended up saying it.

6446
05:58:31,860 --> 05:58:36,760
So maybe in a little way.

6447
05:58:37,020 --> 05:58:39,360
Trust me, I ended up saying, I was like, oh.

6448
05:58:39,480 --> 05:58:40,320
Counter strike class.

6449
05:58:42,200 --> 05:58:43,100
Yeah, counter strike class.

6450
05:58:51,760 --> 05:58:53,060
Moxie is looking good on the meta.

6451
05:58:53,100 --> 05:58:58,780
i like the damage boosts you do keep them up i'm trying now
keep up the damage boosts bro

6452
05:59:02,790 --> 05:59:10,250
i would have preferred a spider-man to venus well we're just
having the spider-man for the finals he just pulls it out

6453
05:59:10,250 --> 05:59:19,150
don't knock it till you try it we're about to play a day no
like you have to go spider-man if would we play ready j3 but

6454
05:59:19,150 --> 05:59:27,510
let's focus on this already yeah we need to focus on this
yeah step by step yeah step by step rock by rock break by

6455
05:59:27,510 --> 05:59:34,010
break break by break you know

6456
05:59:40,260 --> 05:59:54,990
i give you a little bit of waste trust me i need water i've
lost count how many times i've i've drink water it's always

6457
05:59:54,990 --> 06:00:02,790
like that you know when we drafted this team you know we
weren't supposed to be good on paper but we need to show up

6458
06:00:02,790 --> 06:00:05,470
when it matters a

6459
06:00:14,030 --> 06:00:24,190
group of averages until they start beating everyone that's
what we are we're getting the synergy together I believe I

6460
06:00:24,190 --> 06:00:24,650
think so

6461
06:00:30,850 --> 06:00:40,650
let's see I'm banning gambit again I think and I'm banning
cloak if they don't first save it do we ban venom that's the

6462
06:00:40,650 --> 06:00:46,230
question because I have a feeling like in the best of three
we want to like try something new so think they're not going

6463
06:00:46,230 --> 06:00:52,790
to save them first yeah yeah they will not save they might
save mantis first i'm pretty sure it feels to me like that

6464
06:00:52,790 --> 06:01:00,210
would be the best play right now i think we do meant to say
first again to be honest yeah yeah yeah i like that too yeah

6465
06:01:00,210 --> 06:01:07,530
i think so what do we want to do to break the spawn hold
though yeah we either go jet star we go i don't like storm i

6466
06:01:07,530 --> 06:01:16,230
really don't like it if anything like i feel like dive on
this map though it's always like really hard i don't Storm

6467
06:01:16,230 --> 06:01:16,990
Goudnite, right?

6468
06:01:17,410 --> 06:01:18,250
I have to play that.

6469
06:01:18,290 --> 06:01:19,330
Storm Falkite, maybe?

6470
06:01:21,190 --> 06:01:22,370
Storm Falkite, Cloak?

6471
06:01:23,050 --> 06:01:23,130
No.

6472
06:01:23,790 --> 06:01:25,350
Unless Marks, he headshots everyone.

6473
06:01:25,490 --> 06:01:25,950
I don't think so.

6474
06:01:27,490 --> 06:01:29,090
I mean, that's good.

6475
06:01:29,170 --> 06:01:29,630
Let me think.

6476
06:01:31,110 --> 06:01:32,550
Ban, Venom here is the question.

6477
06:01:32,690 --> 06:01:33,710
We definitely want Cloak on.

6478
06:01:34,310 --> 06:01:35,290
We need Cloak on.

6479
06:01:35,290 --> 06:01:37,390
Do we need to ban the Banom if we ban the Mantis?

6480
06:01:37,650 --> 06:01:38,170
Is Banom done differently?

6481
06:01:38,170 --> 06:01:39,370
I really like the Mantis plan too.

6482
06:01:39,670 --> 06:01:40,530
I really think so.

6483
06:01:40,910 --> 06:01:41,730
I really think so.

6484
06:01:41,810 --> 06:01:42,690
It is Mantis instead.

6485
06:01:43,730 --> 06:01:45,390
Maybe we can ban the last if they don't say.

6486
06:01:45,410 --> 06:01:52,850
it here but i think they can go in this phoenix is a is a
breaker though you need to be careful about that but we have

6487
06:01:52,850 --> 06:02:00,230
triple against it need to think i

6488
06:02:05,440 --> 06:02:16,040
think i save cloak i think i save cloak and i need to think
about what we ban the tank i want to ban a tank here really

6489
06:02:16,040 --> 06:02:26,120
badly i kind of want to ban mech or venom you think it's mag
or venom up to you yeah i like mag as well if you want mag

6490
06:02:26,120 --> 06:02:33,340
for yeah come on honestly venom we can just counter it by
going to support and helping yeah let me think okay we have

6491
06:02:33,340 --> 06:02:40,040
triple i definitely want to save cloak here because then if
they like even into grude i'm very confident i can just we

6492
06:02:40,040 --> 06:02:45,840
can just kill the grude with moonlight that's i think we go
grude moonlight storm here I think so too.

6493
06:02:45,860 --> 06:02:52,160
I mean for the whole map or just the beginning.

6494
06:02:52,540 --> 06:02:53,100
Attack, attack, attack.

6495
06:02:53,340 --> 06:02:53,740
Yeah, for that.

6496
06:02:54,180 --> 06:02:55,720
I think we just win off by combos.

6497
06:02:56,260 --> 06:02:56,900
Yes, I think so too.

6498
06:02:57,440 --> 06:02:58,080
Okay, that's okay.

6499
06:02:58,700 --> 06:02:59,040
I think.

6500
06:02:59,740 --> 06:03:00,000
Yeah.

6501
06:03:00,100 --> 06:03:01,620
Question is what do we go with it now?

6502
06:03:01,880 --> 06:03:02,980
We can go like everything.

6503
06:03:03,160 --> 06:03:04,120
We can go even Emma.

6504
06:03:04,660 --> 06:03:06,440
I really don't believe in the Emma though.

6505
06:03:07,180 --> 06:03:08,300
I don't like Emma too much.

6506
06:03:08,580 --> 06:03:08,680
Yeah.

6507
06:03:09,200 --> 06:03:10,700
I think Emma is really bad.

6508
06:03:11,220 --> 06:03:13,220
They actually fought with this strange, not gonna lie.

6509
06:03:13,220 --> 06:03:13,960
I think Thing.

6510
06:03:14,100 --> 06:03:15,200
I think Thing Root.

6511
06:03:15,880 --> 06:03:16,240
Unironically.

6512
06:03:17,200 --> 06:03:18,300
I really think Thing Root.

6513
06:03:18,520 --> 06:03:18,640
Yes.

6514
06:03:19,140 --> 06:03:20,200
I really think that's better.

6515
06:03:21,200 --> 06:03:22,120
With Storm Moonlight.

6516
06:03:22,180 --> 06:03:23,840
If they go in with Venom, we just kill the Venom.

6517
06:03:24,160 --> 06:03:27,000
Yeah, I can just discard one of their targets and we kill
him.

6518
06:03:27,460 --> 06:03:30,120
If they're on... Wait, if they're on Venom's spawn hold, I
think I'm gonna swap.

6519
06:03:30,260 --> 06:03:31,420
I think I should probably swap off Storm.

6520
06:03:31,760 --> 06:03:32,620
I think I'm gonna Daredevil.

6521
06:03:35,300 --> 06:03:36,780
If they're on Venom.

6522
06:03:36,920 --> 06:03:38,000
I don't like playing Storm against Venom.

6523
06:03:38,040 --> 06:03:39,820
I mean, we can always go Denim later, right?

6524
06:03:40,480 --> 06:03:40,820
Yeah.

6525
06:03:40,940 --> 06:03:41,420
If we want.

6526
06:03:43,220 --> 06:03:44,500
We can always go triple with that.

6527
06:03:44,780 --> 06:03:46,420
All right, tab back, tabbing back in.

6528
06:03:46,620 --> 06:03:48,160
Hello, yeah, yeah.

6529
06:03:48,540 --> 06:03:49,160
What do I play?

6530
06:03:49,920 --> 06:03:50,160
Cloak.

6531
06:03:50,540 --> 06:03:51,600
Cloak, okay, cool.

6532
06:03:54,560 --> 06:03:54,940
I got sing.

6533
06:03:54,980 --> 06:03:56,740
I'll give that bond is unbreakable.

6534
06:03:57,860 --> 06:04:02,040
Let me just tell the target and I can discard him.

6535
06:04:02,640 --> 06:04:04,420
Yeah, I will also amp at the same time.

6536
06:04:04,640 --> 06:04:04,940
Yeah, okay.

6537
06:04:05,420 --> 06:04:06,200
They're on Phoenix.

6538
06:04:06,240 --> 06:04:07,480
Do you trust me or?

6539
06:04:07,920 --> 06:04:08,300
They're on Phoenix?

6540
06:04:08,620 --> 06:04:09,680
Okay, I'm going DD then.

6541
06:04:09,780 --> 06:04:10,400
I'm going DD then.

6542
06:04:10,660 --> 06:04:11,500
Yeah, yeah, here you have it.

6543
06:04:11,660 --> 06:04:12,740
I'll go Mantis.

6544
06:04:12,780 --> 06:04:13,120
What do we go?

6545
06:04:13,680 --> 06:04:14,440
I'm going to finish it.

6546
06:04:14,500 --> 06:04:15,320
We can go this.

6547
06:04:15,560 --> 06:04:16,920
Triple with DD, solo DPS, no?

6548
06:04:17,220 --> 06:04:17,480
Yeah.

6549
06:04:17,540 --> 06:04:20,820
Yeah, I'll go.

6550
06:04:20,860 --> 06:04:22,320
Can you take Hydran with MiN-Ocsie?

6551
06:04:22,400 --> 06:04:22,780
Can you take Hydran?

6552
06:04:23,640 --> 06:04:24,040
Phoenix Hydran.

6553
06:04:24,140 --> 06:04:24,900
Phoenix Hydran.

6554
06:04:25,000 --> 06:04:25,580
Helping it free.

6555

Oh, I can't, I can't, I can't, yeah.

6556

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6559
06:04:30,640 --> 06:04:32,240
Just push the cart back.

6560
06:04:32,240 --> 06:04:32,560
Push the cart then I'll go.

6561
06:04:32,640 --> 06:04:33,500
Yeah, push the cart and I will go.

They have Luna 100%.

6937
06:17:47,140 --> 06:17:48,520

6938
06:17:48,540 --> 06:17:50,360

6939
06:17:50,520 --> 06:17:52,280

Let's fucking go!

6965
06:18:52,060 --> 06:18:53,340

Yay.

6970
06:18:56,560 --> 06:18:57,000
Hey!

6971
06:19:01,600 --> 06:19:03,300
Can I get them Can I get them?

6972
06:19:03,320 --> 06:19:10,740
like five minutes to go to the shop and get like i should
have like a little break time breaky time wait we should

6973
06:19:10,740 --> 06:19:25,820
because like tp back when like the car is like curving i
like always it up it's actually like aids that's three ggs i

6974
06:19:25,820 --> 06:19:41,680
told you guys ggs I told you guys GG's Top three The
question is What do we do against Slay?

6975
06:19:41,680 --> 06:19:48,680
I knew I felt the prophecy In my head I felt It's getting
sweaty guys Should we mute up the comms?

6976
06:19:49,440 --> 06:20:00,120
It's getting late Like it's getting late Into the tournament
Yeah maybe Yeah you know you know they're listening what

6977
06:20:00,120 --> 06:20:09,400
were you saying sweetie i believe so much of your talking
player i would understand you no i was i was about to say

6978
06:20:09,400 --> 06:20:14,540
something because i think the sponsored if they if they
first save if they start first saving cloak we should leave

6979
06:20:14,540 --> 06:20:22,520
bandit open and band cloak first it might be ggs are you
sure they warned me up if that's if they save

6980
06:20:27,080 --> 06:20:31,900
should first ban cloak or we should be first ban cloak or
gambit either we default gambit but like if we get shut on

6981
06:20:31,900 --> 06:20:36,140
by cloak yesterday we start first banning close bro they
have cooper on backland i don't want to do that cooper is

6982
06:20:36,140 --> 06:20:42,360
legit like i got it i'm gonna go grab one any other support
in the tournament doesn't matter crook is out cyprus out

6983
06:20:42,360 --> 06:20:49,920
cool like literally the only good gambit play like insane
gambit players left against cooper you know fate is okay but

6984
06:20:49,920 --> 06:20:51,360
like he's not yeah Yeah.

6985
06:20:52,060 --> 06:20:56,220
But like, I'm saying like we are not winning against Cooper
player.

6986
06:20:56,380 --> 06:20:56,900
We will not win.

6987
06:20:57,200 --> 06:21:00,160
It's just like if they first hit Cloak, it'll just be AIDS.

6988
06:21:00,520 --> 06:21:00,940
That's it.

6989
06:21:01,340 --> 06:21:01,540
Yeah.

6990
06:21:02,900 --> 06:21:04,820
It's just not winnable against that.

6991
06:21:05,400 --> 06:21:06,140
I know it's AIDS.

6992
06:21:06,300 --> 06:21:06,680
I know it's AIDS.

6993
06:21:06,820 --> 06:21:07,940
I don't know how to stop it though.

6994
06:21:08,240 --> 06:21:11,080
Like we can go Namor and go mirror ourselves.

6995
06:21:12,240 --> 06:21:15,900
I really think the bench that we have right now is good.

6996
06:21:16,000 --> 06:21:20,140
If they save Cloak first, I think we just like ignore every
support.

6997
06:21:22,820 --> 06:21:28,160
unironically and just play Groot and ban around that, like
ban tanks.

6998
06:21:28,340 --> 06:21:33,420
I think we ban Mac, I think we ban Emma and I think we ban
Groot last or something, like unironically.

6999
06:21:35,700 --> 06:21:36,680
Are you, do you fuck with that?

7000
06:21:37,080 --> 06:21:40,660
Yeah, I think, I think we do have to play some Groot comp if
Cloak is saved.

7001
06:21:40,840 --> 06:21:41,780
I think dive is too hard.

7002
06:21:41,820 --> 06:21:44,100
They're doing the triple support, but it doesn't matter.

7003
06:21:44,960 --> 06:21:47,600
Because they don't have good DPS, like their DPS will never
play triple.

7004
06:21:47,940 --> 06:21:50,240
They will not go triple Loki, they don't have the players
for that.

7005
06:21:51,260 --> 06:21:52,080
Yeah, I know.

7006
06:21:52,520 --> 06:21:52,580
Yeah, I know.

7007
06:21:52,800 --> 06:21:53,660
And then it's like weird.

7008
06:21:54,560 --> 06:21:55,680
Disassociation time.

7009
06:21:56,340 --> 06:22:00,560
I did a job well done, which means I can disassociate.

7010
06:22:24,140 --> 06:22:24,500
Okay.

7011
06:22:26,420 --> 06:22:28,780
I have a whisper in my ear.

7012
06:22:28,900 --> 06:22:32,920
I need to look at someone's profile to check the bands that
happened.

7013
06:22:33,980 --> 06:22:34,600
Oh, my God.

7014
06:22:34,740 --> 06:22:36,520
We've just been nonstop gaming.

7015
06:22:36,800 --> 06:22:37,880
I'm so tired.

7016
06:22:43,300 --> 06:22:49,180
god 39 support full win rate for a support full is so
actually crazy

7017
06:22:52,950 --> 06:23:06,650
we keep going the ride never stops the ride never stops that
is good that is good bands that is huge bands actually but

7018
06:23:06,650 --> 06:23:13,690
then they go name one oh they did wait i think they're
talking about bands i should mute them

7019
06:23:16,750 --> 06:23:20,370
I think they're trying, they're like, mute comms, mute
comms.

7020
06:23:20,490 --> 06:23:24,110
And then I'm like, let the comms play.

7021
06:23:32,590 --> 06:23:34,050
Wait, Moxie didn't mute comms.

7022
06:23:34,170 --> 06:23:34,550
Doesn't matter.

7023
06:23:35,750 --> 06:23:36,130
Yeah, I know.

7024
06:23:36,250 --> 06:23:36,690
Yeah, I know.

7025
06:23:36,890 --> 06:23:37,270
It's OK.

7026
06:23:37,390 --> 06:23:38,750
Moxie didn't mute comms.

7027
06:23:39,510 --> 06:23:40,150
It's OK.

7028
06:23:41,450 --> 06:23:42,750
50% for no reason.

7029
06:23:43,270 --> 06:23:43,670
Kind of annoying.

7030
06:23:45,550 --> 06:23:47,810
Yeah, but I like the bands that they did is good.

7031
06:23:48,070 --> 06:23:50,410
Like they banned Hella and Phoenix second and third.

7032
06:23:51,630 --> 06:24:00,730
because it's okay if moxie didn't mute it then it's like we
go down together yeah they don't play them yeah i think so

7033
06:24:00,730 --> 06:24:05,950
too hey like don't play mantis if they play mantis it would
be mantis in two two two which is this troll

7034
06:24:10,090 --> 06:24:21,010
that's right they say we were the weakest teams and i was
like you're right and then i was proven wrong but then i was

7035
06:24:21,010 --> 06:24:22,830
like you weren't right

7036
06:24:29,850 --> 06:24:31,390
You weren't right.

7037
06:24:33,150 --> 06:24:34,110
It's actually tough.

7038
06:24:34,470 --> 06:24:37,310
Now we're also not going to mute up that's some beta shit.

7039
06:24:37,450 --> 06:24:38,270
I can't lie.

7040
06:24:39,130 --> 06:24:39,570
That's why.

7041
06:24:40,270 --> 06:24:40,630
It's fine.

7042
06:24:41,970 --> 06:24:45,830
If we get banned out and we lose because that's, it
shouldn't be the reason why we lose.

7043
06:24:45,950 --> 06:24:47,770
Then it's create beta shit.

7044
06:24:48,110 --> 06:24:48,830
Bro, look at this.

7045
06:24:49,670 --> 06:24:51,790
Their support, enemy supports POV is just hilarious.

7046
06:24:51,950 --> 06:24:55,290
This is like Deadpool garbage all over their screen and a DD
on them.

7047
06:24:56,390 --> 06:25:03,310
the plushie inside of them is so ace man yeah i know i can

lot worse at that or like uh trying them more with bucky

break honestly and then go back fresh and clear.

7080
06:28:40,510 --> 06:28:44,230
I want to, not gonna lie, I want it to delegate the
interview.

7081
06:28:47,230 --> 06:28:52,070
I was like, Bro, what can I give them?

Oh my god.

7096
06:33:57,730 --> 06:34:00,890
I feel like this timer is the slowest timer ever seen.

7097
06:34:01,450 --> 06:34:07,810
They showed the clip of the Thor killing my two teammates
yet didn't cut to me climbing that wall and surviving it.

7098
06:34:08,470 --> 06:34:11,650
Like, yeah, that Thor got those two kills.

7099
06:34:13,990 --> 06:34:25,090

it kills 99 of the um the disinfectant kills 99.99 of germs

Me.

7103
06:34:52,000 --> 06:34:59,140
Yeah, I believe that they didn't cut to me dodging death
right after.

7104
06:34:59,300 --> 06:35:01,060
He's like, you forgot one.

7105
06:35:10,090 --> 06:35:11,130
They didn't.

7106
06:35:11,230 --> 06:35:11,410
No.

7107
06:35:11,710 --> 06:35:12,210
They didn't.

7108
06:35:12,570 --> 06:35:12,570
No.

7109
06:35:13,770 --> 06:35:14,330
They didn't.

7110
06:35:14,390 --> 06:35:15,810
Like, look, it's there again!

7111
06:35:15,970 --> 06:35:16,650
It's there again!

7112
06:35:16,710 --> 06:35:17,470
Where's me?

7113
06:35:19,850 --> 06:35:21,650
They missed the climb!

7114
06:35:23,250 --> 06:35:24,490
There I am!

7115
06:35:28,340 --> 06:35:33,340
They show that alt again, and yet Silph didn't show me
climbing up.

7116
06:36:12,330 --> 06:36:12,930
I...

7117
06:36:15,170 --> 06:36:16,470
I don't hear them.

7118
06:36:21,550 --> 06:36:22,950
I don't hear them.

7119
06:36:22,990 --> 06:36:24,810
Am I... I can't hear them at all.

7120
06:36:27,070 --> 06:36:28,110
Oh, no.

7121
06:36:57,710 --> 06:36:59,330
I literally don't hear anything.

7122
06:36:59,350 --> 06:37:01,910
I heard like the entire playthrough.

7123
06:37:06,170 --> 06:37:06,850
Wait, are you guys talking?

7124
06:37:06,990 --> 06:37:07,950
I can't hear you.

7125
06:37:08,230 --> 06:37:13,050
I can't hear anything.

7126
06:37:14,230 --> 06:37:15,010
Oh, no.

7127
06:37:19,730 --> 06:37:24,790
I don't hear anything.

7128
06:37:25,790 --> 06:37:26,430
Are they talking?

7129
06:37:27,310 --> 06:37:30,850
Oh, they can't hear me.

7130
06:37:31,190 --> 06:37:33,430
Okay, they can't hear me and then...

7131
06:37:33,950 --> 06:37:35,150
Wait, we can hear you.

7132
06:37:35,230 --> 06:37:36,730
Oh, thank God I can hear you.

7133
06:37:36,890 --> 06:37:37,430
I can...

7134
06:37:37,430 --> 06:37:37,910
Yeah, hello.

7135
06:37:38,590 --> 06:37:39,390
Hey, guys.

7136
06:37:39,910 --> 06:37:40,230
Hey.

7137
06:37:41,390 --> 06:37:42,870
Okay, cozy, go ahead again.

7138
06:37:43,730 --> 06:37:44,670
No, this is great.

7139
06:37:45,270 --> 06:37:48,690
But, hey, last time, you went against J.

7140
06:37:48,850 --> 06:37:49,890
You fell 2 to 1.

7141
06:37:50,010 --> 06:37:55,110
What's the difference this time in how to rise against team
J3?

7142
06:37:55,630 --> 06:37:57,730
Oh, you're asking the wrong person.

7143
06:37:59,390 --> 06:38:00,990
Well, I'm not leaking the strat.

7144
06:38:01,190 --> 06:38:06,730
I mean, I mean, well, obviously, I'm not going to leak the
strats of the enemy right now.

7145
06:38:06,850 --> 06:38:09,010
They got to find out during the match.

7146
06:38:09,110 --> 06:38:10,030
We figured it out.

7147
06:38:10,330 --> 06:38:15,250
And I was definitely listening to my pros when they were
analyzing them.

7148
06:38:16,070 --> 06:38:17,190
So not revealing it.

7149
06:38:17,210 --> 06:38:19,110
You're going to have to see it during the games.

7150
06:38:20,030 --> 06:38:22,840
You saw you pushing that payload.

7151
06:38:23,220 --> 06:38:27,100
Oh, it was my reward.

7152
06:38:27,400 --> 06:38:28,540
I was afraid you were sleeping.

7153
06:38:30,220 --> 06:38:31,340
It was my reward.

7154
06:38:33,020 --> 06:38:34,680
It was really funny.

7155
06:38:34,940 --> 06:38:39,320
You were sitting on cart, and then all of your teams was
just pushing into their spawn, spawn camp.

7156
06:38:39,480 --> 06:38:42,320
You were just spamming your heels into the wall ricocheting.

7157
06:38:42,480 --> 06:38:45,900
Yeah, yeah, I was like, the math numbers were going in my
head.

7158
06:38:46,020 --> 06:38:47,640
I was like, it's geometry time.

7159
06:38:48,040 --> 06:38:51,700
If I angle this right here, that's going to hit him right
there.

7160
06:38:52,760 --> 06:38:54,900
I also failed math in high school.

7161
06:38:56,580 --> 06:39:02,360
Jay, you've been, you've been, you know, waiting for a
little bit now.

06:39:34,820 --> 06:39:35,660
And Doki's falling asleep.

7169
06:39:36,000 --> 06:39:36,480
Yeah, that was close.

7170
06:39:36,640 --> 06:39:37,680
I heard my enemy talking.

7171
06:39:37,820 --> 06:39:38,500
It was so boring.

7172
06:39:39,000 --> 06:39:40,600
I am about to fall asleep from lock-in.

7173
06:39:40,900 --> 06:39:42,420
Doki and me are about to pass out.

7174
06:39:42,580 --> 06:39:43,240
Okay, let's get going.

7175
06:39:43,260 --> 06:39:44,340
Yeah, we got this.

7176
06:39:44,360 --> 06:39:44,840
Have fun.

06:39:45,260 --> 06:39:46,540
Yeah, GGs, guys.

7178
06:39:46,600 --> 06:39:46,920
Let's keep going.

7179
06:39:47,760 --> 06:39:48,200
All right.

7180
06:39:48,200 --> 06:39:49,040
All right, best of luck.

7181
06:39:50,140 --> 06:39:51,220
GGs, all right.

7182
06:39:53,480 --> 06:39:53,920
GGs.

7183
06:39:54,360 --> 06:39:55,320
Oh, my gosh.

7184
06:39:55,680 --> 06:39:57,200
Well, there you have it.

7185
06:39:58,740 --> 06:39:59,620
Really chat.

7186
06:40:00,560 --> 06:40:01,040
Really chat.

7187
06:40:01,180 --> 06:40:02,100
It's between who's more time.

7188
06:40:02,120 --> 06:40:02,160

7189
06:40:02,660 --> 06:40:05,220

06:40:18,860 --> 06:40:25,860

7191
06:40:43,250 --> 06:40:49,070
all right wait i'm listening to them talking about me

7192
06:40:57,440 --> 06:41:00,640
Oh yeah, team captain, see I have to wait for so long.

7193
06:41:57,330 --> 06:41:58,070
They just crackle.

7194
06:42:01,330 --> 06:42:02,690
I mean, it's a good dive map.

7195
06:42:03,110 --> 06:42:03,990
It's a good dive map.

7196
06:42:04,230 --> 06:42:04,670
I can't lie.

7197
06:42:04,910 --> 06:42:05,830
I don't think they chose yet.

7198
06:42:06,530 --> 06:42:07,150
They did, I did.

7199
06:42:07,910 --> 06:42:08,170
Did they?

7200
06:42:08,270 --> 06:42:08,430
Oh.

7201
06:42:09,030 --> 06:42:09,450
Yeah, they did.

7202
06:42:09,450 --> 06:42:09,910
They say crackle.

7203
06:42:11,050 --> 06:42:11,910
It's a good dive map.

7204
06:42:13,090 --> 06:42:16,390
I think we just stay with the plan that we did last last
game.

7205
06:42:16,870 --> 06:42:17,550
I think so too.

7206
06:42:17,890 --> 06:42:17,930
Don't.

7207
06:42:19,710 --> 06:42:20,350
Yeah, yeah.

7208
06:42:21,250 --> 06:42:21,270
Yeah.

7209
06:42:21,550 --> 06:42:21,570
Night.

7210
06:42:35,270 --> 06:42:38,050
I don't know why we guys just like, we're just a tab though.

7211
06:42:38,490 --> 06:42:41,090
I was like, actually, I don't know if it's Didi maybe first.

7212
06:42:41,190 --> 06:42:43,670
No, it's like, where am I hearing these voices from?

7213
06:42:44,350 --> 06:42:45,930
I'm like trying to figure out the voices.

7214
06:42:46,550 --> 06:42:49,590
You guys don't hear it, but like the interview was part was
still going on.

7215
06:42:49,830 --> 06:42:52,470
Like the main channel casting was still going on.

7216
06:42:53,170 --> 06:42:55,450
I'm like, where do the voices come from?

7217
06:42:55,990 --> 06:42:57,210
Oh, I'm here.

7218
06:42:58,390 --> 06:42:58,630
All right.

7219
06:42:58,690 --> 06:42:58,910
I'll try.

7220
06:42:59,130 --> 06:42:59,330
Hello.

7221
06:43:00,210 --> 06:43:00,390
Hmm.

7222
06:43:16,360 --> 06:43:23,540
don't have to ban um i mean i'm thinking we don't have to
save dd and i can just play sigh because i think size like

7223
06:43:23,540 --> 06:43:30,640
probably better against they'll be unlucky no we just go in
with one thing ready i guess that's how it is notice i i

7224
06:43:30,640 --> 06:43:42,280
said i said ready i see which hero do you think you guys
want to do the same bans then as yeah i think so i think we

7225
06:43:42,280 --> 06:43:45,820
just added cloak honestly Yeah, I think Gambit Cloak is like
100% done.

7226
06:43:46,100 --> 06:43:47,580
And then from that, nobody banned these.

7227
06:43:47,720 --> 06:43:49,240
The last one is like, kind of flex.

7228
06:43:50,280 --> 06:43:52,160
I don't actually think we banned Mantis, unironically.

7229
06:43:53,200 --> 06:43:53,320
Nope.

7230
06:43:53,900 --> 06:43:57,220
I mean, I think against this team, I don't think we have to.

7231
06:43:58,100 --> 06:43:58,660
This is...

7232
06:43:58,660 --> 06:44:00,320
They say they insta-save, Hela.

7233
06:44:01,880 --> 06:44:03,180
Just banned Cloak in this, no?

7234
06:44:04,200 --> 06:44:04,560
Yeah.

7235
06:44:04,860 --> 06:44:07,020
So you guys, oh my god, also, look at that.

7236
06:44:07,120 --> 06:44:08,320
You separate me and Gail?

7237
06:44:08,580 --> 06:44:09,040
Yeah, I think this is fine.

7238
06:44:09,420 --> 06:44:11,040
Do you separate me and Gail?

7239
06:44:11,460 --> 06:44:12,320
And then...

7240
06:44:12,320 --> 06:44:13,040
BAM!

7241
06:44:13,520 --> 06:44:21,520
both actually this is the highest we both ever placed in a
tournament for these creator tournaments that are not vtuber

7242
06:44:21,520 --> 06:44:32,580
related every time we put the photos together we get like
last or second last place but will you separate us too look

7243
06:44:32,580 --> 06:44:40,940
at that i think that's like good i think we're just spending
this the curse it's real i think that yeah all right and

7244
06:44:40,940 --> 06:44:46,760
then laud's better Honestly, if they say the hell at first,
I think they want us to ban Naeemur, no?

7245
06:44:46,900 --> 06:44:47,600
Yeah, I think she'll do.

7246
06:44:47,680 --> 06:44:48,460
Why would they do that?

7247
06:44:48,640 --> 06:44:49,300
I think it's a good one.

7248
06:44:49,560 --> 06:44:50,860
I think it's actually...

7249
06:44:50,860 --> 06:44:51,820
He'll just play Bucky too.

7250
06:44:52,420 --> 06:44:54,020
They won't have to just say he needs...

7251
06:44:54,020 --> 06:44:54,540
No, no, no, no, no.

7252
06:44:54,540 --> 06:44:55,540
I think you have to...

7253
06:44:55,540 --> 06:44:56,740
No, no, no, no.

7254
06:44:56,740 --> 06:44:57,580
I actually think Jeff...

7255
06:44:57,580 --> 06:44:58,720
I think on this map, Jeff's good.

7256
06:44:59,000 --> 06:44:59,660
Yeah, I think Jeff.

7257
06:45:01,000 --> 06:45:01,360
Yes, I think Jeff.

7258
06:45:01,360 --> 06:45:05,500
I actually think we can always play Cloak Jeff or Cloak
Invis or Jeff Invis or Jeff.

7259
06:45:05,820 --> 06:45:06,780
Oh, Jeff, Luna.

7260
06:45:08,680 --> 06:45:10,060
The Rocket Ban is good from them.

7261
06:45:10,060 --> 06:45:15,700
i really don't hate that but it's like okay let's see what
they save last save last pen is either mantis or phoenix

7262
06:45:15,700 --> 06:45:23,620
phoenix if we can i think no it can't be phoenix it cannot
be phoenix they saved it do we buy lucky or what's up wait

7263
06:45:23,620 --> 06:45:32,360
wait wait wait i think you want mantis no and they are first
to play lucky yeah yeah yeah yeah we do this we do this it's

7264
06:45:32,360 --> 06:45:37,100
super eight for them and speed just like one minute to love
you they don't they don't have a bit but they also like

7265
06:45:37,100 --> 06:45:49,500
don't mantis player literally like go 30 ps don't play it go
in this jeff i think should be open yep i don't think i

7266
06:45:49,500 --> 06:45:55,900
don't think it has to invest jeff i think mac is fine do we
want to play three support or have moxie on hawkeye or

7267
06:45:55,900 --> 06:46:03,980
something i mean they will play hella phoenix so do we need
i don't say we can't even support hella phoenix can we we

7268
06:46:03,980 --> 06:46:08,100
don't want no we don't want Yeah.

7269
06:46:09,140 --> 06:46:10,020
We can do that.

7270
06:46:10,820 --> 06:46:11,520
I don't like that.

7271
06:46:11,720 --> 06:46:12,620
I really don't like that.

7272
06:46:12,980 --> 06:46:15,600
I think Moxie should just like play Nemo himself.

7273
06:46:16,320 --> 06:46:18,400
But I think we can put Doki on cloak as well.

7274
06:46:18,720 --> 06:46:21,040
I can also give him DD nightly sigh because they're going to
be on.

7275
06:46:24,160 --> 06:46:24,680
No, no, no.

7276
06:46:24,820 --> 06:46:25,600
I think that's a bad idea.

7277
06:46:25,700 --> 06:46:26,700
I actually think that's a bad idea.

7278
06:46:26,820 --> 06:46:27,480
I think we just go.

7279
06:46:27,740 --> 06:46:27,920
I don't know.

7280
06:46:27,940 --> 06:46:29,040
You're referring to him on fucking.

7281
06:46:30,940 --> 06:46:31,340
Hawkeye.

7282
06:46:31,500 --> 06:46:31,980
Let's go.

7283
06:46:32,020 --> 06:46:32,580
Hawkeye is good.

7284
06:46:32,960 --> 06:46:33,780
Fuck it.

7285
06:46:34,140 --> 06:46:34,960
Fuck it.

7286
06:46:35,180 --> 06:46:36,440
Just run the comfort ship.

7287
06:46:36,800 --> 06:46:37,000
Yeah.

7288
06:46:37,300 --> 06:46:38,340
Yeah, yeah.

7289
06:46:38,340 --> 06:46:39,620
Go Venom or Deadpool.

7290
06:46:39,880 --> 06:46:39,940
Yeah.

7291
06:46:39,940 --> 06:46:41,460
I think I'm going to start bottom left, by the way.

7292
06:46:41,580 --> 06:46:43,180
They like never walk like top right.

7293
06:46:43,340 --> 06:46:44,680
They always just go to point and then initiate.

7294
06:46:44,740 --> 06:46:46,300
What if we, what if I go cap though?

7295
06:46:46,320 --> 06:46:46,980
No, I need to go with that.

7296
06:46:47,160 --> 06:46:47,380
Triple tank.

7297
06:46:48,560 --> 06:46:49,400
You can actually go cap.

7298
06:46:49,540 --> 06:46:50,720
I got the phone with Vlad as well.

7299
06:46:51,080 --> 06:46:51,360
Okay.

7300
06:46:51,500 --> 06:46:51,940
Let's do this.

7301
06:46:51,980 --> 06:46:52,180
I know.

7302
06:46:52,500 --> 06:46:53,200
That's a good idea.

7303
06:46:53,780 --> 06:46:53,960
Yeah.

7304
06:46:54,040 --> 06:46:54,280
Lucky.

7305
06:46:54,880 --> 06:46:56,420
We just need to push the win.

7306
06:46:56,500 --> 06:46:58,440
You have to have really hard pushing the hell out.

7307
06:46:58,620 --> 06:46:59,420
Where do I go?

7308
06:47:00,600 --> 06:47:01,100
Wait, where do I go?

7309
06:47:02,000 --> 06:47:03,580
I'm doing a really long rotation.

7310
06:47:03,800 --> 06:47:03,820
Okay.

7311
06:47:03,820 --> 06:47:04,740
I'm doing a really long rotation.

7312
06:47:04,880 --> 06:47:05,760
I'm going all the way bottom left.

7313
06:47:06,520 --> 06:47:06,640
Yeah.

7314
06:47:07,660 --> 06:47:08,480
I see rocket.

7315
06:47:09,400 --> 06:47:10,900
I can hit, I can hit.

7316
06:47:11,620 --> 06:47:12,400
I'm crossing down high.

7317
06:47:13,780 --> 06:47:14,740
I can break res beacon, maybe.

7318
06:47:14,980 --> 06:47:16,360
I'm not trying to break res beacon.

7319
06:47:16,800 --> 06:47:17,380
I'm breaking squids.

7320
06:47:17,540 --> 06:47:18,420
I'm on back.

06:47:18,800 --> 06:47:20,900

Hella, hella, hella, hella.

No burn, no burn, no burn.

I need help.

7325
06:47:28,800 --> 06:47:29,200
I need help.

7326
06:47:29,580 --> 06:47:30,220
I'm breaking squids.

7327
06:47:30,400 --> 06:47:31,120
I'm breaking squids.

7328
06:47:31,360 --> 06:47:31,600
I need help.

7329
06:47:31,820 --> 06:47:32,120

7451
06:52:21,220 --> 06:52:26,680
Just do it instantly next time can you speed you out there
in salai in the middle of the point then we need to save

7452
06:52:26,680 --> 06:52:31,220
food because we we had we used two supporters there we just
win the fight if we just play i think we will have killed

7453
06:52:31,220 --> 06:52:35,920
thing loki we could have just we would have just killed
thing and we would just insta win like it's we need to be

7454
06:52:35,920 --> 06:52:42,160
super careful in this matchup just do safely they use
everything i think they might have emma though it's it's so

7455
06:52:42,160 --> 06:52:47,580
if we win if we flank behind i really i really like want to
play i really want to play cybers that it's like so good i

7456
06:52:47,580 --> 06:52:49,320
think i think moxie i

7457
06:52:52,340 --> 06:52:53,060
I think that.

7458
06:52:54,580 --> 06:52:55,240
Okay, I don't know.

7459
06:52:55,540 --> 06:52:57,260
We'll just set up for a dive or what?

7460
06:52:57,560 --> 06:52:59,940
Do we not want to play, do we not want to play like Venom or
something?

7461
06:53:00,680 --> 06:53:01,300
Or maybe not on this one.

7462
06:53:02,500 --> 06:53:05,460
We could full dive, but like I don't, I don't, I don't like
that.

7463
06:53:05,560 --> 06:53:07,080
I think DAP on Venom is doing too much.

7464
06:53:08,200 --> 06:53:09,540
Oh DAP on Mac.

7465
06:53:10,400 --> 06:53:13,840
Okay, I do think Zylok is too good into that.

7466
06:53:14,000 --> 06:53:15,760
Yeah, I think it's so good too.

7467
06:53:17,440 --> 06:53:18,640
Yeah, Zylok is probably better though.

7468
06:53:19,280 --> 06:53:19,620
Just wait.

7469
06:53:22,100 --> 06:53:24,820
Can maybe play a bit slower and just build the fight
normally?

7470
06:53:26,320 --> 06:53:26,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7471
06:53:26,840 --> 06:53:28,080
I'm gonna be far left.

7472
06:53:28,940 --> 06:53:30,140
They're going window, all in window.

7473
06:53:31,040 --> 06:53:31,700
They're going wide.

7474
06:53:33,020 --> 06:53:34,760
I mean, I'm looking for the right side.

7475
06:53:34,840 --> 06:53:36,860
Can pierce three, two, one, plank?

7476

06:53:41,280 --> 06:53:41,900
I'm going to go.

7501
06:54:41,160 --> 06:54:41,600
I want to go with mine.

7502
06:54:41,740 --> 06:54:42,420
We should walk forward.

7503
06:54:43,020 --> 06:54:43,660
Pressure the neutral.

7504
06:54:43,880 --> 06:54:44,660
Yeah, I'm going to walk in the go.

7505
06:54:45,040 --> 06:54:45,120
I'm going to heal.

7506
06:54:46,240 --> 06:54:48,600
I want Hella held up her, held up her, held up her, held her
up.

7507
06:54:52,780 --> 06:54:53,100
Okay.

7508
06:54:53,540 --> 06:54:54,000
Go back, Cap.

7509
06:54:54,160 --> 06:54:54,480
Go back, Cap.

7510
06:54:54,640 --> 06:54:55,040
I don't want to kill.

7511
06:55:06,740 --> 06:55:07,060
Yeah, yeah.

7512
06:55:07,060 --> 06:55:09,440
I'm lucky to see you.

7513
06:55:09,500 --> 06:55:11,400
I'm lucky to see you guys walk inside right now.

7514
06:55:11,500 --> 06:55:11,680
Okay.

7515
06:55:11,740 --> 06:55:12,000
I can...

7516
06:55:12,000 --> 06:55:12,860
I got your best shot in three.

7517
06:55:13,360 --> 06:55:15,260
Three, two, one...

7518
06:55:16,700 --> 06:55:18,420
Rock it in, rock it out, rock it out.

7519
06:55:18,440 --> 06:55:18,580
They killed it.

7520
06:55:18,660 --> 06:55:19,380
They killed, they killed.

7521
06:55:19,820 --> 06:55:20,380

Rocket, one, rock it one, rock it one, roc 했는데.

06:56:27,580 --> 06:56:28,680
Rocket, rocket's one on the TP.

7532
06:56:29,200 --> 06:56:29,800
Luna fell off the map.

7533
06:56:29,920 --> 06:56:30,460
Luna fell off the map.

7534
06:56:33,240 --> 06:56:34,500
it's a cloud wave right now.

7535
06:56:34,740 --> 06:56:35,340
They have really low of hills.

7536
06:56:35,460 --> 06:56:35,900
They have really low hills.

7537
06:56:36,040 --> 06:56:37,080
Only rock deals it would know.

7538
06:56:37,660 --> 06:56:38,560
I might need help.

7539
06:56:44,610 --> 06:56:45,430
The TPing back.

7540
06:56:45,830 --> 06:56:46,730
I didn't know they had health.

7541
06:56:47,450 --> 06:56:48,730
If I knew I would have saved it.

7542
06:56:48,770 --> 06:56:49,330
I'm on beginner.

7543
06:56:49,330 --> 06:56:58,210
like we stopped all tracking we need to ban emma i'm saying
it oh it's doing too much it's the emma and the thing like

7544
06:56:58,210 --> 06:57:03,510
every time i go in yeah it's too much it's too much it's
both it's both he just wins every resource rate on point we

7545
06:57:03,510 --> 06:57:11,170
need to stop it just controlling aim assist i also didn't
have i didn't have my jump for invis so i couldn't do

7546
06:57:11,170 --> 06:57:20,550
anything about it so it's like i didn't have my shield i
didn't have my jump so i was just like i die i just that if

7547
06:57:20,550 --> 06:57:27,950
we go this exact matchup it's kind of shit we will not ban
mantis last maybe we'll ban emma last i don't think i don't

7548
06:57:27,950 --> 06:57:35,990
think we need to ban mantis i think we just save mantis and
still beat me to be honest and then we just yeah actually

7549
06:57:35,990 --> 06:57:48,330
you're right you're so right you are definitely 100 right we
do that okay yeah you're right i think last man should be

7550
06:57:48,330 --> 06:57:52,770
like a tank i think thing or emma instead of mantis i think
other than that we can do the same bands

7551
06:57:58,710 --> 06:58:05,250
yeah can't play dude it's like so it's playing yeah they're
playing they're just playing across the map straight on

7552
06:58:05,250 --> 06:58:12,390
point so we can't get an advantage out of like going in as
well it's like so it's yeah i also get like slammed by a

7553
06:58:12,390 --> 06:58:14,170
thing when i'm like trying to go in like

7554
06:58:18,170 --> 06:58:23,110
i don't know i think that my i don't know my i guess because
i haven't played invis this entire tournament so i was like

7555
06:58:23,110 --> 06:58:29,390
i don't mind just keep this i think i think my oaths were
not that great either yeah i really think that we just need

7556
06:58:29,390 --> 06:58:38,210
mech to i just thought we could i thought we could like we
could kill them but every time i oathed nobody died i was

7557
06:58:38,210 --> 06:58:46,550
like oh i'm gonna oath it but nobody died yeah i think we
lost against them last time though um no not ik perf i hate

7558
06:58:46,550 --> 06:58:53,090
okay psycho i'm gonna have to time you up for a little bit
because like at one point we don't want that we can play

7559
06:58:53,090 --> 06:59:00,590
conflict with the other one map it's great for us but like
no like the criticism isn't constructive i'm sorry you've

7560
06:59:00,590 --> 06:59:08,910
been very negative throughout this isn't spider i'm gonna
give you a little break time just a little break time no no

7561
06:59:08,910 --> 06:59:18,090
no they're gonna play hell and not go in a timeout yeah go
in a timeout corner i think spider island is great Yeah, I

7562
06:59:18,090 --> 06:59:19,210
think that's a good point.

7563
06:59:30,510 --> 06:59:39,910
Like, I understand, like, my Invis is not great right now,
but also I was, I didn't practice Invis at all throughout

7564
06:59:39,910 --> 06:59:49,750
the tournament, and also not even in rank, rank, because I
was told I just play Rocket, and I had to focus on these,

7565
06:59:49,910 --> 06:59:51,590
and Wining will focus on these.

7566
06:59:54,830 --> 07:00:01,010
So, I know, but you didn't have to be like, your Invis is
fucking garbage.

7567
07:00:03,990 --> 07:00:05,090
Actually, it's a winnable though.

7568
07:00:06,470 --> 07:00:07,550
Just need a little bit of adjustment.

7569
07:00:07,850 --> 07:00:08,190
Maybe need to.

7570
07:00:08,890 --> 07:00:11,390
So I have to put you in a timeout corner.

7571
07:00:12,010 --> 07:00:13,630
Can we ban both Hella and Phoenix?

7572
07:00:13,850 --> 07:00:14,650
That's kind of wasted.

7573
07:00:15,130 --> 07:00:15,870
No, if it's not.

7574
07:00:15,870 --> 07:00:16,690
They're saving at first.

7575
07:00:16,810 --> 07:00:20,690
Look, the only person that can roast me to that degree is
me.

7576
07:00:21,870 --> 07:00:24,410
And I know my Invis was pretty shit there.

7577
07:00:25,630 --> 07:00:35,110
that's it yeah i think so we can't punish the fact i mean
what we had right now is optimal i think like i really think

7578
07:00:35,110 --> 07:00:40,370
if i played solid at the end there and i played it for
longer we would just like every solid will just win a fight

7579
07:00:40,370 --> 07:00:48,350
straight up like that's like guaranteed yeah i don't know
it's just it's just so hard bro like their thing is

7580
07:00:48,350 --> 07:00:53,710
literally only playing anti-dive like he's legit not even
like in the front he's just sitting on his back way ready to

7581
07:00:53,710 --> 07:00:59,930
like shift me stuff like i think i think we probably can
play some front to back i have to change my play style my

7582
07:00:59,930 --> 07:01:05,690
positioning for the new new one i've saved mantis now and we
play front to back and i go good and i've this guy okay yeah

7583
07:01:05,690 --> 07:01:11,570
this guy's so bad on root we just win then i don't think so
too

7584
07:01:15,810 --> 07:01:17,370
did they pick the map yet

7585
07:01:22,610 --> 07:01:24,570
oh yeah we picked a map okay

7586
07:01:31,130 --> 07:01:41,210
i think it's just like dying that much I think my all
placements my all placement just hasn't been great I don't

7587
07:01:41,210 --> 07:01:44,270
know honestly I

7588
07:01:57,740 --> 07:02:05,000
definitely think my my own placements was bad but I it was
hard to figure I felt like we could have won but it was not

7589
07:02:05,000 --> 07:02:13,340
winnable I actually believe in your mentors Moxie you know
what you're doing I like it a lot yeah I should have used it

7590
07:02:13,340 --> 07:02:22,420
more defensively but it was hard to it more defensively i
think we do the same bans and we just save mantis first yeah

7591
07:02:22,420 --> 07:02:22,800
i agree

7592
07:02:26,260 --> 07:02:32,640
maybe we don't need to ban mantis last time we can just yeah
i don't i don't think you need super chat thank you you'll

7593
07:02:32,640 --> 07:02:37,980
be using some proper rest after this tournament don't worry
i'll take proper rest after this tournament and the sponsor

7594
07:02:37,980 --> 07:02:50,940
thing on twitch later and j3 is gonna be forced to play back
yeah you're right can we do a name or emma or no i think i

7595
07:02:50,940 --> 07:02:57,460
think we've been named the more i think we do emma last i
think we do emma last robert name but then the then they

7596
07:02:57,460 --> 07:03:06,040
have clock yeah i'd rather just churn it out now and then
not have to worry about it tomorrow yeah we just do the

7597
07:03:06,040 --> 07:03:13,920
three supports and then let's run look guys no matter what
placing so bad i'm still gonna try i'm still gonna try but

7598
07:03:13,920 --> 07:03:23,700
like my goal was not last we are now third place let's just
try yeah i think we go front to back this map from not last

7599
07:03:23,700 --> 07:03:34,260
to third place like legit just playing thing and afk on the
backland yeah placing bad did not expect top three i could

7600
07:03:34,260 --> 07:03:41,920
just go root if he by saying honestly i think that's what
i'm gonna do yeah yeah we can do that but uh i need i need i

7601
07:03:41,920 --> 07:03:51,940
need emma off though yeah yeah i think i think we just ban
what i'm thinking and then we go yeah just make sure to save

7602
07:03:51,940 --> 07:03:56,920
mantis so we can we're defending first we want to spawn out
there that's right that's a bronze medal right there i think

7603
07:03:56,920 --> 07:03:58,880
all right

7604
07:04:03,110 --> 07:04:05,310
which hero do you think you want to be today

7605
07:04:15,910 --> 07:04:27,360
and then you just ban moonlight first funnel now who am i
gonna banish from this match I mean, they might do that.

7606
07:04:28,480 --> 07:04:31,160
Which heroes will get my cosmic favor today?

7607
07:04:33,180 --> 07:04:38,600
You could last ban Storm, but I think Emma last ban is
better than this.

7608
07:04:41,600 --> 07:04:42,680
Maybe we can run...

7609
07:04:42,680 --> 07:04:48,120
I actually think we run triple, but with Star Lords instead
of like anything else.

7610
07:04:48,440 --> 07:04:48,820
You know what I mean?

7611
07:04:48,940 --> 07:04:49,260
Or Silo.

7612
07:04:49,480 --> 07:04:50,260
Yeah, yeah.

7613
07:04:50,400 --> 07:04:51,100
I think we can play...

7614
07:04:51,100 --> 07:04:54,020
If we play our frontal back, I think our solo DPS could
actually be Star Lords.

7615
07:04:54,100 --> 07:04:54,700
Save Mantis.

7616
07:04:55,440 --> 07:04:56,000
Yeah, Mantis.

7617
07:04:56,000 --> 07:04:56,480
Yeah, Mantis.

7618
07:04:56,760 --> 07:04:57,120
Yeah, save Mantis.

7619
07:04:57,220 --> 07:04:57,760
Save Mantis.

7620
07:04:57,780 --> 07:04:59,140
I'm going to play an AFK right now, my bad.

7621
07:05:00,200 --> 07:05:00,940
Then what do we ban?

7622
07:05:01,640 --> 07:05:01,920
Namor?

7623
07:05:04,320 --> 07:05:05,220
Invisor Loki, probably.

7624
07:05:06,480 --> 07:05:06,700
Okay.

7625
07:05:08,780 --> 07:05:09,420
We're going to be...

7626
07:05:09,420 --> 07:05:10,300
We're going to play Namor on that map.

7627
07:05:10,420 --> 07:05:11,340
It's kind of boring, though.

7628
07:05:19,250 --> 07:05:19,810
I think...

7629
07:05:19,810 --> 07:05:21,310
I think you can...

7630
07:05:22,050 --> 07:05:22,330
I...

7631
07:05:22,330 --> 07:05:22,490
I...

7632
07:05:22,490 --> 07:05:23,850
It needs to be in this, needs to be in this.

7633
07:05:25,490 --> 07:05:26,210
I didn't believe that.

7634
07:05:27,110 --> 07:05:28,070
And now we're just safe.

7635
07:05:30,090 --> 07:05:31,970
I think he's safe cloak, no?

7636
07:05:32,130 --> 07:05:32,530
Cloak?

7637
07:05:32,730 --> 07:05:33,850
No, I think mech.

7638
07:05:34,110 --> 07:05:34,890
I think mech.

7639
07:05:35,370 --> 07:05:36,010
No, no, no.

7640
07:05:36,110 --> 07:05:36,590
They're okay.

7641
07:05:37,090 --> 07:05:38,170
Okay, safe cloak.

7642
07:05:38,750 --> 07:05:39,410
It's okay.

7643
07:05:40,270 --> 07:05:41,950
And I don't think they will bump back.

7644
07:05:42,430 --> 07:05:44,670
I'm not really that worried about the Nemuron high ground.

7645
07:05:44,910 --> 07:05:46,250
I think, like, he...

7646
07:05:46,250 --> 07:05:48,230
I think their team gets ran over if we're on triple.

7647
07:05:49,310 --> 07:05:50,030
Yeah, I think so too.

7648
07:05:50,310 --> 07:05:53,850
And if we're playing Starlord, we just leave for Starlord
and he just wants us to name more?

7649
07:05:55,850 --> 07:05:56,250
Yeah.

7650
07:06:02,190 --> 07:06:02,790
That's fine.

7651
07:06:06,140 --> 07:06:07,600
Yeah, I think that's fine.

7652
07:06:12,460 --> 07:06:14,240
Now the question is, is it Phoenix?

7653
07:06:14,460 --> 07:06:14,720
I don't know.

7654
07:06:14,860 --> 07:06:15,520
I don't think it's Phoenix.

7655
07:06:15,640 --> 07:06:16,560
I really think it's Emma.

7656
07:06:17,740 --> 07:06:19,100
Yeah, get Emma, get Emma.

7657
07:06:20,800 --> 07:06:23,480
But we just can't play anything cool into it.

7658
07:06:24,380 --> 07:06:25,840
We still can run Dive if we want.

7659
07:06:26,400 --> 07:06:29,140
But like, I would want to play Mantis Cloak.

7660
07:06:29,180 --> 07:06:30,120
I think it's just with Sponhaul.

7661
07:06:30,380 --> 07:06:31,840
Yeah, I think we just play the...

7662
07:06:31,840 --> 07:06:32,300
Yeah, with Sponhaul.

7663
07:06:32,920 --> 07:06:35,800
Sponhaul first, but I think once we...

7664
07:06:35,800 --> 07:06:37,960
Like after Sponhaul, I think we go...

7665
07:06:38,480 --> 07:06:44,020
Uh, fucking Groot, Groot, Mantis, Starloot, Solo Diffias
with like Jeff Cloak Mantis or something?

7666
07:06:44,600 --> 07:06:45,260
Yeah, I think so too.

7667
07:06:45,760 --> 07:06:48,720
Should we go Mac Groot or should we go Deadpool Groot?

7668
07:06:49,320 --> 07:06:50,080
I think Deadpool Groot.

7669
07:06:50,620 --> 07:06:51,320
I also think so.

7670
07:06:51,460 --> 07:06:52,400
We have team up and everything.

7671
07:06:52,740 --> 07:06:52,940
Yeah.

7672
07:06:53,420 --> 07:06:55,420
Do we go Mantis though in Pond Hall?

7673
07:06:55,540 --> 07:06:56,220
I mean, it's Pond Break?

7674
07:06:56,420 --> 07:06:59,320
I mean, yes, I don't think so.

7675
07:06:59,440 --> 07:07:00,460
I think we go Rocket.

7676
07:07:01,040 --> 07:07:02,000
I think Rocket is a brand.

7677
07:07:02,300 --> 07:07:03,280
I think we can go Adam.

7678
07:07:04,040 --> 07:07:04,160
No?

7679
07:07:04,740 --> 07:07:05,960
Oh, then just stay there.

7680
07:07:05,980 --> 07:07:07,040
I'm just too late.

7681
07:07:07,800 --> 07:07:08,400
I swear to him, man.

7682
07:07:08,500 --> 07:07:09,500
I mean, the gruel is pretty...

7683
07:07:12,100 --> 07:07:14,880
I think it's probably Adam better.

7684
07:07:15,120 --> 07:07:15,300
You can.

7685
07:07:15,780 --> 07:07:18,200
But if you don't feel like confident on Adam, just him on
this.

7686
07:07:18,640 --> 07:07:19,140
That's fine.

7687
07:07:19,240 --> 07:07:19,460
That's fine.

7688
07:07:19,740 --> 07:07:21,480
Just make sure you play around our build as well.

7689
07:07:21,920 --> 07:07:24,360
Like every bubble, just six stack in it.

7690
07:07:24,820 --> 07:07:25,940
Because we really need to leave.

7691
07:07:27,940 --> 07:07:28,300
Like...

7692
07:07:28,300 --> 07:07:28,660
We're holding...

7693
07:07:28,660 --> 07:07:29,000
Break this wall.

7694
07:07:29,360 --> 07:07:30,120
Because I could have played Loki.

7695
07:07:30,140 --> 07:07:31,580
Break this wall, okay?

7696
07:07:31,700 --> 07:07:32,560
Play inside this wall.

7697
07:07:33,260 --> 07:07:33,680
Yeah, yeah.

7698
07:07:33,760 --> 07:07:34,600
We're holding cart, right?

7699
07:07:34,880 --> 07:07:35,520
We're holding cart.

7700
07:07:36,620 --> 07:07:37,340
We're holding cart.

7701
07:07:37,460 --> 07:07:37,760
We're holding cart.

7702
07:07:38,040 --> 07:07:38,200

We need to go Phoenix.

7750
07:09:38,400 --> 07:09:39,460
It's so important.

7751
07:09:42,460 --> 07:09:44,120
It's like a troll not to play this now.

7752
07:09:45,060 --> 07:09:46,600
Oh, give Moxie Phoenix and Hugo Memphis.

7753
07:09:46,900 --> 07:09:47,460
Two things.

07:09:47,600 --> 07:09:47,840
Yes, that's right.

Just walk up.

7760
07:09:52,760 --> 07:09:53,480
They don't have anything.

7761
07:09:53,580 --> 07:09:54,260
Can we go Moxie?

7762
07:09:54,540 --> 07:09:54,920
Mag one!

7763

Mag one!

7764
07:09:55,380 --> 07:09:55,680

Oh, we're gonna shut out.

7770
07:10:00,580 --> 07:10:00,720
Okay.

7771
07:10:00,760 --> 07:10:01,280
Walking, walking, walking.

7772
07:10:02,460 --> 07:10:02,940
Okay, okay.

7773
07:10:03,080 --> 07:10:03,480
Can we kill?

7774
07:10:03,520 --> 07:10:03,860
Can we kill?

7775
07:10:05,780 --> 07:10:07,040
Two... one, stun, stun.

7776
07:10:07,480 --> 07:10:08,200
We will go back.

7777
07:10:08,660 --> 07:10:09,320
Yeah, I need a holer here.

7778
07:10:09,880 --> 07:10:10,560
I'm touch, I touch.

7779
07:10:10,940 --> 07:10:12,480
Almost a half, I'm 5% off.

7780
07:10:13,180 --> 07:10:13,940
Hello one, hello one.

7781
07:10:18,060 --> 07:10:20,620
Always walk boast, Okay, we have infinite resources.

7782
07:10:21,220 --> 07:10:22,980
Break that, break it, break it, break it, break it.

7783
07:10:23,580 --> 07:10:26,260
I need to get our Croo next fight, next fight, next fight,
next fight.

7784
07:10:29,560 --> 07:10:31,440
There is Hella, there is Andrew, there is systemic.

7785
07:10:31,900 --> 07:10:32,460
Teens you good.

7786
07:10:32,520 --> 07:10:33,420
Cap, Rangelah maybe?

7787
07:10:33,740 --> 07:10:34,980
I didn't contest Rangel or no?

7788
07:10:35,580 --> 07:10:38,280
Yeah, I can't look at it and test the angles.

7789
07:10:39,280 --> 07:10:39,600
Yeah.

7790
07:10:40,000 --> 07:10:40,520
Can we get an Angie?

7791
07:10:40,700 --> 07:10:41,260
I think Angie's good.

7792
07:10:41,400 --> 07:10:41,680
There's that.

7793
07:10:41,780 --> 07:10:42,880
I think I go Angie, yeah.

7794
07:10:43,780 --> 07:10:44,880
Okay, I got my yield.

7795
07:10:45,980 --> 07:10:46,480
I got my yield.

7796
07:10:46,560 --> 07:10:47,980
We can combo on the left, maybe.

7797
07:10:49,980 --> 07:10:50,880
All right, I'll mock them up.

7798
07:10:52,180 --> 07:10:53,120
I can touch.

7799
07:10:53,200 --> 07:10:53,640
I can touch.

7800
07:10:54,020 --> 07:10:54,340
Angela and main.

7801
07:10:54,600 --> 07:10:56,860
Angela and main.

7802
07:10:58,420 --> 07:10:58,700
Angela and main.

7803
07:10:58,700 --> 07:10:59,520
Angela here, Angela here and left.

7804
07:11:00,520 --> 07:11:01,440
Can we lift that?

7805
07:11:01,500 --> 07:11:01,840
Can we lift that?

7806
07:11:01,860 --> 07:11:02,000
Can we lift that?

7807
07:11:02,000 --> 07:11:02,400
Yeah, we should.

7808
07:11:02,580 --> 07:11:02,700
We should.

7809
07:11:03,560 --> 07:11:06,900
Point, point, point, point, point, point, point, point,
point, point, point, point, point, I could test Lila.

7810
07:11:06,920 --> 07:11:07,420
I could test Lila.

7811
07:11:07,920 --> 07:11:08,620
Lucky one, lucky one.

7812
07:11:08,680 --> 07:11:09,180
Hello, hello.

7813
07:11:09,560 --> 07:11:10,900
There is a...

7814
07:11:10,900 --> 07:11:12,000
There is a neighbor to our left.

7815
07:11:12,020 --> 07:11:12,360
There's a...

7816
07:11:12,360 --> 07:11:12,900
Let it back one.

7817
07:11:13,220 --> 07:11:14,100
I have all the plants.

7818
07:11:15,520 --> 07:11:17,000
I have all the plants.

7819
07:11:18,080 --> 07:11:18,420
Can we go?

7820
07:11:18,560 --> 07:11:18,920
Can we go?

7821
07:11:19,160 --> 07:11:19,540
Okay.

7822
07:11:19,960 --> 07:11:22,900
Oh, I'm dead anyway.

7823
07:11:24,340 --> 07:11:25,120
I'm dead.

7824
07:11:25,480 --> 07:11:25,620
I'm dead.

7825
07:11:25,620 --> 07:11:26,420
I don't...

7826
07:11:26,420 --> 07:11:27,880
We had nothing to bubble me.

7827
07:11:29,100 --> 07:11:30,940
I need to go earlier on next night.

7828
07:11:32,240 --> 07:11:32,980
That'd be nice.

7829
07:11:33,300 --> 07:11:34,000
Pop is about.

7830
07:11:35,420 --> 07:11:36,820
Just hitting checkpoint.

7831
07:11:36,860 --> 07:11:37,820
Oh, no.

7832
07:11:37,820 --> 07:11:40,280
They just have infinite resources on the map.

7833
07:11:40,560 --> 07:11:41,360
So it's...

7834
07:11:41,360 --> 07:11:41,480
Yeah.

7835
07:11:42,480 --> 07:11:44,320
Just have a good back line, so you just don't win.

7836
07:11:44,600 --> 07:11:45,280

7837
07:11:45,540 --> 07:11:46,360
Just go early into them.

7838
07:11:46,460 --> 07:11:48,100
Just pressure more into the hellah.

7839
07:11:48,380 --> 07:11:49,380
Just walk into him.

7840
07:11:49,500 --> 07:11:50,220

7841
07:11:50,300 --> 07:11:51,260
Just walk into him.

7842
07:11:51,760 --> 07:11:52,860

8141
07:22:31,690 --> 07:22:36,550
Bye bye I thought, man, you guys are sad.

8142
07:22:36,910 --> 07:22:38,450
I thought we did pretty good.

8143
07:22:39,090 --> 07:22:39,410
Hey, hey!

8144
07:22:39,830 --> 07:22:43,670
To be fair, I got fucked up in the because I was like, oh
no.

8145
07:22:44,350 --> 07:22:50,150
And you know my path thing more, I guess but it was like,
but it was like in the moment when you're ulting and I was

8146
07:22:50,150 --> 07:22:50,690
like, papa!

8147
07:22:51,190 --> 07:22:53,150
And no papa you know

8148
07:22:56,630 --> 07:23:01,550
I was just like we're but we'll know and then so I was just
like yes I die

8149
07:23:04,610 --> 07:23:12,430
yeah I should I guess I could have went into the house dude
but it's like in the moment when you're in the moment you

8150
07:23:12,430 --> 07:23:22,590
have to figure out the path thing while you're ulting and I
was just like where do I go because I'm like trying to

8151
07:23:22,590 --> 07:23:29,030
figure out the path thing and I'm like I don't know I guess
I die I guess even when I try to go around corners I was

8152
07:23:29,030 --> 07:23:48,520
like he just floats to me yeah but I think we did pretty
well yeah yeah I mean I fucking never stopped playing cloak

8153
07:23:48,520 --> 07:23:54,360
and dagger when she was hardened like the thing that's what
I'm saying all the characters that I play aren't meta and

8154
07:23:54,360 --> 07:24:03,300
like aren't meta tournament run so then when i had to play
invis and luna again i was just like i just spent like 10

8155
07:24:03,300 --> 07:24:11,680
plus hours practicing rocket and cloak and dagger in a
tournament setting because the way i play invis and the way

8156
07:24:11,680 --> 07:24:20,360
i play luna is so different from yeah it's very different
from how you play in a tournament setting so so it's like

8157
07:24:20,360 --> 07:24:22,220
bro i don't know i didn't get chance to

8158
07:24:26,560 --> 07:24:34,760
I'm just like I'm freaking I'm ripping it I'm learning it on
the go I'm learning how to play this play Luna and Sue like

8159
07:24:34,760 --> 07:24:37,140
in this in a tournament environment on the go

8160
07:24:42,150 --> 07:24:51,950
yeah and it was hard because like they had two counters for
cloak ult so I'm just like fuck it no I still have an hour

8161
07:24:51,950 --> 07:24:57,930
and 30 minutes I'm gonna go prep for that I think I did
pretty good I honestly I'm it sucks that my team got really

8162
07:24:57,930 --> 07:25:01,630
sad of getting third plays, but for me, I'm like, yippee
third!

8163
07:25:02,170 --> 07:25:02,430
You know?

8164
07:25:02,730 --> 07:25:05,430
I'm like, yeah, third place!

8165
07:25:07,710 --> 07:25:10,270
I thought we did really good.

8166
07:25:10,730 --> 07:25:18,550
In general, J3 was the top seed, so I was just like, and
like, literally, we fucking swapped 20 plus comps.

8167
07:25:20,970 --> 07:25:25,510
We swapped 20 plus comps, and it ain't working, and I don't
think it's gonna keep working.

8168
07:25:25,930 --> 07:25:26,210
Yeah.

8169
07:25:27,170 --> 07:25:27,730
Yeah.

8170
07:25:29,190 --> 07:25:31,630
I know, they all really wanted to win, win.

8171
07:25:31,870 --> 07:25:33,750
But still, I thought we did really well.

8172
07:25:35,090 --> 07:25:39,050
We did really well for, uh...

8173
07:25:39,050 --> 07:25:41,830
Um, for, like, what happens yesterday.

8174
07:25:42,210 --> 07:25:42,510
Yeah.

8175
07:25:47,730 --> 07:25:48,330
Honestly.

8176
07:25:49,510 --> 07:25:50,250
With yesterday?

8177
07:25:50,990 --> 07:25:51,750
Yeah, they had...

8178
07:25:51,750 --> 07:25:53,110
I felt bad for Moxie.

8179
07:25:53,230 --> 07:25:56,710
