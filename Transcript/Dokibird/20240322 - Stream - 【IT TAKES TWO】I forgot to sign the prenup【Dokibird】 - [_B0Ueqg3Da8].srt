00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,710
Hello everybody!

2
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,910
Hello...

3
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,490
Wait, are you still on your phone?

4
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,010
I'm still on your phone!

5
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,890
I thought you were gonna get out your...

6
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,450
Guys, I was listening to Gumi chopping her artichokes.

7
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:17,690
And now her stomach hurts because she ate too many artichokes.

8
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,370
New artichokes.

9
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,470
I had an artichoke cam while we were... I was waiting.

10
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,590
Okay, guys, a several disargument with both me, guys.

11
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,450
Is artichoke a food or a side dish?

12
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,370
A garnish?

13
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,690
Artichokes are fucking...

14
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,670
A dressing.

15
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,290
I don't think artichoke is a food.

16
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,750
You don't just eat...

17
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,290
You don't just eat a garnishing.

18
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,670
You don't just eat a artichoke.

19
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,810
You have other things with the artichoke.

20
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,490
She just ate an artichoke for like dinner last night.

21
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,890
She like...

22
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,530
What do you...

23
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,510
What do you...

24
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,450
She just ate... I was like, you just ate an artichoke?

25
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,930
And she's like, yeah, I just ate an artichoke.

26
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,750
It's like her favorite thing.

27
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,970
I was like, that's not food.

28
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,210
That's not...

29
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,770
That's not food.

30
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,850
You can't just eat an artichoke.

31
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:23,510
And then we had like a debate about whether or not vegetables are considered food.

32
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,010
Sorry for all the vegetarians and vegans out there.

33
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,770
I'm telling you.

34
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,190
Artichoke is...

35
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,570
Do you know what a garnish or a dressing is?

36
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,550
Yes, I know what it is.

37
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,590
But like artichoke is like...

38
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,010
It's just an artichoke.

39
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,470
It's just an artichoke.

40
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:53,270
You tell me what your definition of a garnish and or a dressing is.

41
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,590
It's like a side thing.

42
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,870
Like, you know, you put it on top of real food.

43
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,990
You're pissing me off.

44
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,010
What do you mean a side thing?

45
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,770
You don't just eat artichoke.

46
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,710
You don't just order...

47
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,130
Okay, do you go to a restaurant and just order one artichoke?

48
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:08,990
Sometimes.

49
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,690
Really?

50
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,130
Yeah, is it a main dish or a side dish?

51
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,510
It's a side dish, but...

52
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,190
Hold on.

53
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,490
I got my artichokes from Costco and they're really big.

54
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,770
That's not a restaurant!

55
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,790
What are you saying?

56
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,230
That's not a restaurant!

57
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,290
I was like, do you go to a restaurant and like...

58
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,390
I said yes!

59
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,730
I said yes!

60
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,070
I said yes!

61
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,210
Then you went, I go to Costco.

62
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,010
I was telling you that...

63
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,170
I went to Costco and got these really big artichokes.

64
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,750
That's why it's not just a side dish to me.

65
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,630
Yeah, but you chop off the big artichoke and then make it into small things.

66
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,150
So you can just have...

67
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,530
You don't just eat an artichoke as a main dish.

68
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,330
You just don't.

69
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,830
What do you mean chop up the artichoke?

70
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,350
Do you know how to eat an artichoke?

71
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,170
Yeah, you chop... I literally saw you...

72
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,730
You were like live streaming yourself chopping artichokes for me.

73
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:11,990
What the fuck do you mean?

74
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,450
I was cutting the top off!

75
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,190
You have to cut the top of the leaves off!

76
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,390
It's... It's an artichoke.

77
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,970
You can't just eat an artichoke.

78
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,830
You can't.

79
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,490
It's impossible!

80
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,450
What do you mean it's impossible?

81
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,310
By the way, I never got your in line.

82
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,530
What the fuck do you mean?

83
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,470
Are you just too busy chopping artichokes?

84
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,230
I hate chopping artichokes.

85
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,450
Okay, let me invite you again.

86
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,170
I invited you.

87
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,430
I'm still not getting it.

88
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,110
Wait, what?

89
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,350
Is it because I didn't click play on mine first?

90
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,170
Yeah, I think you...

91
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,150
No!

92
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,410
Wait, what?

93
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,650
Wait, no, that's not right.

94
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:01,850
Okay.

95
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,530
You got it?

96
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:03,870
Okay.

97
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,690
Nope.

98
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,330
My sound guy was like...

99
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,550
Gumi's volume is good despite her passion for artichoke.

100
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,390
I need to talk to your sound guy.

101
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,710
Let him do the group chat.

102
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,650
Alright, I'm gonna make a poll.

103
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,570
I'm gonna make a poll.

104
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,130
I'm gonna make a poll.

105
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,090
Is artichokes...

106
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,050
Are artichokes a mini dish?

107
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,290
Guys, I need you guys to actually vote with your heart.

108
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,770
And don't vote because you...

109
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,070
You wanna fuck with me.

110
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:35,930
Like...

111
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,270
What do you mean?

112
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,650
I mean they always vote with their heart.

113
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,490
No, no, no, no.

114
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,550
No, no, no, no.

115
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,710
I need them to vote with their heart.

116
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,110
Like, would you eat...

117
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,850
I voted with my heart.

118
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,090
Okay.

119
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,390
Would you eat an artichoke as your main dish?

120
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,950
Like, okay.

121
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,910
Vegetarian.

122
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,710
Vegan.

123
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,210
Fried.

124
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,030
Vegetarians don't just eat artichokes.

125
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,490
They eat salads.

126
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,870
They can have salads and like other shit.

127
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,070
They don't just be like...

128
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,710
Halo stare.

129
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,870
I can eat salads and stuff.

130
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,270
I just want an artichoke.

131
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,150
They don't say that.

132
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,870
They don't say that.

133
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,510
I might not be a vegetarian, but I won't be like...

134
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,070
Hello, can I just have an artichoke for dinner?

135
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,550
Like, I would not say that.

136
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,130
It is like a side and an appetizer.

137
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,010
Exactly.

138
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,870
Look, 70% people agree with me that it's not a main dish.

139
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,390
I never said it was a main dish.

140
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,170
No, no, no.

141
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,730
This is our entire argument.

142
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,410
I don't eat it for dinner.

143
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,870
This was our entire argument.

144
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,430
What did you say?

145
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,210
I was like...

146
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,010
Do you see the artichoke?

147
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,310
No.

148
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,350
The argument was that you called it a dressing or a garnish.

149
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,430
No, I said dressing, garnish, side.

150
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,610
I said dressing, garnish, side.

151
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,310
It can't be all three.

152
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,450
It cannot be all three.

153
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,650
No, I said dressing, garnish, or side.

154
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,290
And you were like...

155
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,790
You were like, no, I just eat the artichoke.

156
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,630
I was like, that is not...

157
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,410
You can't do that.

158
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,350
You can't just eat an artichoke as a main dish.

159
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,970
Also, I sent you another invite.

160
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,510
I can't do that.

161
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,630
I just sent you another invite.

162
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,050
I'm not getting it.

163
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,710
Then you are what's wrong with society.

164
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,680
I sent you another invite.

165
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,160
I said it was my main dish.

166
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,700
Not anyone's main dish.

167
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,220
But my main dish.

168
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,220
So you are a freak then.

169
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,860
But you know what?

170
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,220
I'll even send you a photo of my artichoke from last night.

171
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,020
Because I was...

172
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,120
I was...

173
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,200
I was eating that shit.

174
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,360
Then you got a stomach ache after.

175
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,640
You were like, oh, I think I got a tummy hurt because it was from the artichoke.

176
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,060
Yeah.

177
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,700
Who said that?

178
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,900
Who said that?

179
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,260
No.

180
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,640
It's because I ate two artichokes yesterday.

181
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
Oh my god.

182
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,580
A whole two?

183
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,820
I wonder...

184
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,580
You can't just get a stomach ache because you...

185
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,740
Oh my god.

186
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,520
It's like, yeah, I had two eggs today.

187
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,040
That's why my tummy hurt.

188
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:50,980
Like, what?

189
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
What is that logic?

190
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,740
What is that logic?

191
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,880
No, I'm saying that logic exists because of the fiber.

192
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,560
The fiber.

193
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,320
It's gonna make me need a poo.

194
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,170
Holy shit.

195
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,750
Those are giant artichokes.

196
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,350
I told you.

197
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,410
What the fuck?

198
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,010
Look at the size of comparison.

199
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,570
What?

200
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:17,970
That...

201
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,190
You're freaking...

202
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,350
What?

203
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,590
She sent me a picture of her artichoke dish.

204
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,250
You can just stream.

205
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,610
Go ahead.

206
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,090
I don't care.

207
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,290
And I was like, what the fuck is this?

208
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,330
What the fuck is a giant artichoke?

209
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,250
What kind of...

210
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,950
What the fuck?

211
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,730
Were they grown in the...

212
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,110
Were they grown in the lab or some shit?

213
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,030
What is this fucking artichoke that I'm looking at?

214
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,590
Alright, guys.

215
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,490
I'm gonna try not to show Gumi's thighs.

216
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,210
Did I have to take the photo like that?

217
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,750
Because my keyboard was messed up.

218
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,650
Whoops, I accidentally...

219
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,990
I accidentally...

220
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,470
Okay, I sized myself bigger just for comparison with the artichoke.

221
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,870
Which...

222
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,730
It was sort of an accident, but...

223
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,450
What do you mean by comparison?

224
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,330
Like, look...

225
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,150
Oh my god.

226
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,870
That's a giant ass artichoke.

227
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,430
No wonder your tummy hurt.

228
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,630
Holy fuck.

229
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,810
Also, give me a second.

230
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,870
I need to resize myself.

231
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,550
I'm way too close to the screen.

232
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,010
What the fuck is that?

233
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,370
That's an artichoke.

234
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,230
That's...

235
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:31,670
What?

236
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,010
Oh, dang.

237
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,170
What the fuck is that?

238
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,790
It's an artichoke.

239
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,710
What the fuck is that?

240
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,410
Look, if people in my chat are like, what the fuck is that?

241
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,110
Then...

242
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,610
That's not...

243
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,570
This is not a me issue.

244
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,510
Okay, I'm just saying those are giant artichokes.

245
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,250
This is true.

246
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,110
And that's why it was a main dish to me because it was so huge.

247
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,490
But don't...

248
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,170
Why don't you just cut it up?

249
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,210
Why would I cut it up?

250
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,110
It doesn't change the way you eat it.

251
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,130
Someone was like, that thing belongs to the wilderness.

252
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,730
Not the table.

253
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:23,430
That looks like a dead space baby, genetically modified artichoke.

254
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,890
No, do you know what?

255
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:34,810
You're right, because they are fucking huge and my mom bought me them because she's like, look how big these artichokes are, and I know you love artichokes.

256
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,970
Someone was like, you're supposed to take it apart.

257
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,110
What the fuck?

258
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,870
Well you're not even eating artichokes, right?

259
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,250
No, you haven't!

260
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,310
That's what I've been saying!

261
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,430
Because you called it a garnish dude.

262
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,870
Garnish is like putting like tiny parsley on top.

263
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,050
Well, like, yeah, I mean you can still put that on top.

264
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,670
It's just gonna be the whole thing.

265
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,790
Bro, accept my fucking if, but I said you like three.

266
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,550
I'm telling you it's not working!

267
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,870
Restart your game!

268
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:12,510
I did!

269
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,950
Oh wait, no I didn't.

270
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,830
I know you didn't because you were too busy talking about my artichokes!

271
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,950
Look, it's not... look that... it was important.

272
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,090
It was a very important conversation.

273
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,390
You wouldn't understand.

274
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,270
You're out here fucking stuffing yourself with artichokes.

275
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,790
Can we talk about our wording?

276
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,890
Can we talk about how we phrase things?

277
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,730
Yeah, I'm not gonna change my wording.

278
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,770
What are you talking about?

279
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,330
What the fuck?

280
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,170
I'm not gonna change.

281
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,530
Okay, alright, let me invite you again.

282
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,470
Alright, play online.

283
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,110
I'm connecting.

284
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,490
Okay, I'm literally staring at the game.

285
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,070
I'm staring at it.

286
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,650
Alright, I sent you an invite.

287
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,290
I got it!

288
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,250
I got it!

289
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,130
See, it wasn't my fault.

290
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,850
You literally just restarted.

291
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,050
No, no, no.

292
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,370
Because you restarted too, right?

293
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,070
Alright, so we'll never know whose fault it is.

294
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,770
I didn't restart.

295
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,050
Because we'll never know.

296
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,090
No, you restarted, right?

297
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,250
You restarted.

298
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,690
We'll never know whose fault it is, guys.

299
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,250
We'll never know.

300
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,910
Alright, this is me.

301
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,750
We're getting a divorce.

302
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,970
I don't know if you guys noticed, but we're...

303
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,390
Guys, I don't know if you guys noticed, but...

304
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,350
We might be getting a divorce.

305
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,530
We might be.

306
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,710
Gumi, are you alive?

307
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,870
Gumi?

308
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,610
Oh, I think she's dead.

309
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,210
Guys...

310
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,250
Sorry, I was talking about my artichoke.

311
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,310
You're choking on your artichoke.

312
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,390
I told you to cut up the artichoke!

313
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,330
That's not how you eat it.

314
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,390
That's not how you eat it.

315
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,190
Yes, you can!

316
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,650
Just cut it up!

317
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,250
You're fucking choking!

318
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,990
I wasn't choking!

319
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,290
I was getting my controller!

320
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,270
You just said you were choking on an artichoke!

321
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,010
You're making shit up.

322
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,090
No, no, no.

323
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,230
I'm pretty sure... Chat...

324
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,030
Chat, did I hear it correctly?

325
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,890
She said she was choking on the artichoke.

326
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,950
She has so many toys.

327
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,890
Alright, what were we supposed to do here?

328
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,030
Oh, we had the car!

329
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,430
Alright, I called dibs on the car.

330
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,190
Don't do it!

331
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,150
You kept crashing last time!

332
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,290
No, no, it's because you were driving.

333
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,490
I'm a better driver.

334
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,750
It's time for a new friend.

335
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,990
Because I'm the wife.

336
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,290
She did!

337
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,130
It's not because of whatever you are.

338
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,090
I don't know why.

339
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,530
It's just that you as a person...

340
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,230
It's just that you as a person...

341
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,810
With your personality, it's just a worse driver.

342
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,250
With your personality, it's just a worse driver.

343
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,570
Nothing else.

344
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,130
That's crazy.

345
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,190
That's a crazy line.

346
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,170
That's a crazy line.

347
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,370
Oh, I see.

348
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,990
Yeah!

349
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,290
Okay.

350
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,690
What the fuck was that?

351
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,150
What the fuck was that?

352
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,630
Alright, you pulled too hard!

353
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,770
Stop pulling it!

354
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,370
What was that?

355
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,930
I fucked up!

356
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,710
Oh my god.

357
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:31,730
Okay.

358
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,930
See, this is it!

359
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,090
This is why we're getting a divorce.

360
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,430
Okay.

361
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,270
Oh, we did it!

362
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:39,490
Yay!

363
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,810
It was just for an achievement.

364
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,310
Let's leave.

365
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,910
I wanna ride in the car.

366
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,330
I wanna ride in the car.

367
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,450
Alright, alright.

368
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,550
Fine, fine, fine.

369
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,130
What the fuck?

370
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,750
What the fuck?

371
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,390
You wanna ride in the car?

372
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,630
Is that what you want?

373
00:19:59,150 --> 00:19:59,630
What?

374
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,170
Why did you do that?

375
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,790
What is going on?

376
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,510
Is that what you...

377
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,550
Whoa...

378
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,710
Is that what you want?

379
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:07,890
Yay!

380
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,470
I'm gonna ride in the car!

381
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,190
Where are we going?

382
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,370
Wait, can I send you through that hole?

383
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,150
Hold on.

384
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,150
Aim it, aim it.

385
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:17,810
Okay.

386
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,840
Well, there's an invisible wall there.

387
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,100
I'm gonna get out of here.

388
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,040
Alright.

389
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,080
I got this.

390
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,120
Go!

391
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,060
Go, wife!

392
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,920
Go!

393
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,680
What the fuck are you...

394
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:42,940
What?

395
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,140
What have you been waiting?

396
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
Go, wife!

397
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,880
Go!

398
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
Is that not how you talk to...

399
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,400
Talk to wife?

400
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,960
Hey, hey.

401
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,980
You know how I said to wait right there?

402
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,560
I can't read.

403
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,320
What do you mean you can't read?

404
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,460
I can't read.

405
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,720
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,280
What?

407
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,880
Okay, you have to do that again.

408
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,700
I thought it would be like an easy thing.

409
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,620
Alright.

410
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,620
What?

411
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,580
Did you just miss?

412
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,400
It's live!

413
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,000
It's live!

414
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,700
How do you miss?

415
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,380
It's literally right in front of you!

416
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,420
I said it slid off.

417
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,080
Why?

418
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,700
How do you miss?

419
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:27,900
Wife!

420
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,280
Wife!

421
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,740
Oh my god, look!

422
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,220
It's Woody!

423
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,300
How did you miss, wife?

424
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,320
What the fuck did I just see?

425
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,380
Nothing.

426
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,060
You didn't hit the flag!

427
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,180
You were supposed to hit the flag with Mario!

428
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,520
I was?

429
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,300
Now we can't get over.

430
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,760
I didn't grow up with Mario.

431
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,240
No, that's just an achievement.

432
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,640
Now we can't get over.

433
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,580
Here, the hole is the goal.

434
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,100
Now we can't get over to the secret side.

435
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,180
Oh yeah, blame the husband.

436
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,320
It's never your fault.

437
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,060
Wait, what's this?

438
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,020
There's like these green things.

439
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,680
What is that?

440
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,040
I don't know.

441
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,060
What is that?

442
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,660
Wait, I think math is next!

443
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,280
I'm pretty sure this is the math area.

444
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,420
Wait, was this useless?

445
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,580
Was this...

446
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
Was this a useless thing to do?

447
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,300
Catching up!

448
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,680
I'm catching up!

449
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,340
I'm catching up!

450
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,360
I'm right here now!

451
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
Hey, what's going on?

452
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,860
I'm catching up!

453
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,940
What's going on?

454
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,860
Hey!

455
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,580
Oh shit!

456
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
Okay, you're back here with me!

457
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:50,740
Yeah!

458
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,620
Hey!

459
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,380
Hey!

460
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,020
Oh fuck!

461
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,540
Okay!

462
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,080
Wait, I figured this out.

463
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,420
You can't do this without me, you know that!

464
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,860
It's fine, I'm here now.

465
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,840
What do we do?

466
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,280
Oh!

467
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,560
Oh!

468
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,820
We have to press this at the same time!

469
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,620
Oh!

470
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,360
Wait, but who's the...

471
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,040
Who's the...

472
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,360
Oh, because I have to go.

473
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,180
Oh!

474
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
Yeah, you go.

475
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,220
And then you...

476
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,880
And then you press...

477
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,340
Ah!

478
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:26,340
Mouse!

479
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,020
Mouse!

480
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,680
Mouse!

481
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,060
That's not a mouse, that's a dog!

482
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:30,920
Hey!

483
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,380
Hey!

484
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,940
Look at the fucking...

485
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,420
Look at the teeth.

486
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,580
Okay, you have a...

487
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,860
Open the mouse!

488
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,760
Open the mouse!

489
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,780
Open the mouse!

490
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,600
Did you say open the mouse?

491
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,420
Horse!

492
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:42,740
Horse!

493
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:42,980
Horse!

494
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,420
Mouse!

495
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,180
Mouse!

496
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,460
Horse!

497
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:49,960
Horse!

498
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,280
Horse!

499
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,460
Horse!

500
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,860
Oh!

501
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,240
Baby!

502
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,720
Baby!

503
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,240
Alright, Cody!

504
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Come on over!

505
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,040
That wasn't so difficult, was it?

506
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,400
Okay, you can screen cheat by the way.

507
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,200
Oh my god!

508
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,360
You're pro... wait!

509
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
Wait, I said...

510
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,600
Why did you do that?

511
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,760
I am against screen peaking.

512
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,920
Oh yeah, now you're against screen peaking!

513
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah, now you are!

514
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,540
Alright!

515
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,080
What happened?

516
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,920
Dog!

517
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,700
Horse!

518
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,540
Lion!

519
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:27,940
Lion!

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,280
Lion!

521
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,680
Lion!

522
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:28,920
Lion!

523
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,320
Sheep!

524
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,460
Sheep!

525
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:34,820
Frog!

526
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,020
Ribbit!

527
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,300
Ribbit!

528
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,540
Ribbit!

529
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:39,980
Lion!

530
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,400
Lion!

531
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:40,600
Lion!

532
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:40,720
Lion!

533
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,880
I hate that we have to work together.

534
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,360
Open it!

535
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,640
Is it great?

536
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,680
Yeah!

537
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,360
My beautiful wife!

538
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,280
Hello!

539
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,160
What took you so long?

540
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,080
My beautiful wife!

541
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,260
Who I love very much!

542
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,500
Who I love very much!

543
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,080
I fucking hate my husband.

544
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,660
Whoa!

545
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,700
I worked so hard to put food on the table!

546
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,100
I worked so hard to put food on the table!

547
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,380
And that's what you say?

548
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,100
Yeah, I'm the engineer, so...

549
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,800
Yeah!

550
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
And I'm a farmer!

551
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,160
Shut up!

552
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,680
Shut up!

553
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,860
Looks like we have to solve it?

554
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,120
Oh shit, it's this.

555
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,380
Wait, 6 plus 5?

556
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,360
6.

557
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,580
Oh, plus 3.

558
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,060
Yeah.

559
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,040
See?

560
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,560
Simple maths.

561
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,060
Yay!

562
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,460
Get off of 6, you bitch!

563
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,100
6 plus 1 makes 16.

564
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,660
You need to move an egg!

565
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,260
6 plus 1 makes 16.

566
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,000
6 plus 1!

567
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,920
Well, this is embarrassing.

568
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,120
You suck at maths.

569
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,440
6 plus 1 makes what?

570
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,300
It makes 8.

571
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,460
2!

572
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,820
2!

573
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,320
It's 2!

574
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,380
Okay, I'll go here now.

575
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,220
We can be 6 together.

576
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,960
You said this would be easy, man!

577
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,140
You're pissing me off!

578
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,040
You're pissing me off!

579
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,080
Yay!

580
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,660
Get on 3 right now!

581
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,600
Get on 3 right now!

582
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:32,620
Okay...

583
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,620
Okay, where do I go?

584
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,340
Oh, I got 6!

585
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,020
Yeah!

586
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,140
Oh, what's this?

587
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,600
Oh, what's this?

588
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,940
Okay, there's two cherries here.

589
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,480
Now they're not there anymore.

590
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
They're not there.

591
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,340
Orange.

592
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,800
Oh, strawberry.

593
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,900
I already forgot half of these.

594
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,500
Oh, strawberry!

595
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:03,980
Here!

596
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,840
And then... banana!

597
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,100
Cherry's a bo- Here, here, here!

598
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,720
No!

599
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,320
I actually- No!

600
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,640
Okay, that wasn't a cherry.

601
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,820
Where is eggplant?

602
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,340
Cherry!

603
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,440
Cherry!

604
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,800
Okay, we have two.

605
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,600
No, that's the eggplant.

606
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,500
Oh, thank god that was actually where the orange was.

607
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,240
More math!

608
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,780
That's not math.

609
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,700
It's numbers.

610
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,240
Oh, I can do that!

611
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,160
Wait, do you have- Can it just be you moving?

612
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,920
Push it!

613
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,660
Push it!

614
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,640
Oh, I go up!

615
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,500
I go up!

616
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,740
And then you go- It's this way!

617
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,100
It's right!

618
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,920
And then seven is up.

619
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,560
What do you mean it's right?

620
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,800
I'm literally going right!

621
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,520
It's up!

622
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,000
It's down!

623
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,560
Okay.

624
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:55,960
Woah!

625
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,780
Why are you going to eleven?!

626
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,980
What do you mean?

627
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm trying to- I'm trying to navigate, woman.

628
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,360
Trying to do what, woman?

629
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,520
Alright, sixty- Hey!

630
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,620
It's right side!

631
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,880
What are you doing?!

632
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,540
I'm literally going right!

633
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,460
No, you're not.

634
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:15,920
No, you're not.

635
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,880
I feel the resistance!

636
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,820
Wait, where's the twenty?

637
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,680
Is it above me?

638
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,740
Oh!

639
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,140
Where the fuck did the twenty go?!

640
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,280
Where was the twenty?!

641
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,160
Where was the twenty?!

642
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,400
Right here!

643
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:28,880
Right here!

644
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,660
Oh, I thought that was a twenty-six!

645
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,640
Right here!

646
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:31,640
Oh, I thought that was a twenty-six!

647
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,360
That looked like a twenty-six!

648
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,180
I couldn't tell!

649
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,920
Okay, you can move.

650
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:39,940
Okay.

651
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,180
I thought that was a- I thought that was a twenty-six!

652
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:45,900
I thought that was a twenty-six!

653
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,960
The zero was like- was like scratched off!

654
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,800
Okay.

655
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,800
Ten, eleven, twelve...

656
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,140
This is like- This does not look great.

657
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,960
This looks fucking ugly.

658
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,020
It's your fault.

659
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,900
Why is it my fault?!

660
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,600
It takes two to tangle!

661
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,480
Wow!

662
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,420
How did we fuck that up?!

663
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,260
You're taking too long!

664
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,660
You're taking too long!

665
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:10,880
How?!

666
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:10,920
How?!

667
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,100
How?!

668
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,180
You're taking too long!

669
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,920
I am really moving so fucking fast!

670
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,780
Alright, alright.

671
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,380
I am going so fast.

672
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,640
I'm pushing the- I'm pushing the crosshair.

673
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,940
Okay, here we go.

674
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,220
Nine...

675
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,760
Where are you going?!

676
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,940
Where are you going?!

677
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,040
Why do you keep forgetting ten?!

678
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,840
Why?!

679
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,240
Why?!

680
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,940
What did ten do to you?!

681
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,940
How do we know it's me?

682
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,740
How do we know it's me?!

683
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,020
It takes two!

684
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,120
How- how- It literally says, it takes two.

685
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,100
How do you know it's my fault?

686
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,300
Because you keep going lower than we need to!

687
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,240
You don't know that.

688
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,920
As long as I get it in, that's all that matters.

689
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,020
What?

690
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,640
How?!

691
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
How did that happen?!

692
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,420
Like, I literally pressed it!

693
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,900
I literally pressed it!

694
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,680
I swear to God!

695
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,700
I swear that was not my fault.

696
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,640
I think that was not my fault.

697
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,540
Where are you going?!

698
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,740
Okay.

699
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,500
I am!

700
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,400
It's just, the drawing is supposed to be like this!

701
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay.

702
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,380
What?

703
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,360
Fourteen... it was born this way.

704
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,020
Fifteen...

705
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,700
And then sixteen...

706
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,500
Seven...

707
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,540
Seen?!

708
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,340
Like, why does it do that?!

709
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,360
We went to seventeen!

710
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,020
That is not our fault!

711
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,020
I literally went to seventeen!

712
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,250
Went to seventeen!

713
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,390
I don't know what's wrong.

714
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:04,830
What?!

715
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,990
That wasn't even- That's not even my fault at that point!

716
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,450
Okay...

717
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,810
I don't know why we can't get past sixteen.

718
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,230
I don't know why.

719
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,330
Why?!

720
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,770
Why?!

721
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,530
Why can't we do this?!

722
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,090
I can't understand!

723
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,750
I don't...

724
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,330
What's your sense on your mouth?!

725
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,490
What's your sense on your mouth?!

726
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:29,510
I don't know.

727
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,630
No, it's not my fault!

728
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,850
It is not my fault!

729
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,910
It is not my fault!

730
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,290
Alright, I'm gonna let you move, okay?

731
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,250
There.

732
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,510
There.

733
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,270
See, look.

734
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,950
I'm letting you do most of the heavy lifting now.

735
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,650
Where are you going?

736
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,630
To eleven.

737
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,130
Okay.

738
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,250
I can't move because of you!

739
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,910
I can't move either!

740
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,790
Okay.

741
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,450
Fourteen.

742
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,870
Alright.

743
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,910
Fifteen.

744
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,330
Alright.

745
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,710
Sixteen.

746
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,270
See?!

747
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,190
See?!

748
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,090
See?!

749
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,610
That's not even us!

750
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,310
That's not even us!

751
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,180
That's not- That's not even me!

752
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,040
That is not even me!

753
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,780
Google how to do!

754
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,880
That's not even me!

755
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,100
That's not even me!

756
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,800
I swear to God!

757
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,780
It's not even me!

758
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:38,620
Help!

759
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,660
Help!

760
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,300
Help!

761
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,360
I'm all the way on the side now.

762
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Help!

763
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,420
Help!

764
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,860
We stuck on this one of all fucking problems.

765
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,860
Change your mouse TPI.

766
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,120
What do you mean?!

767
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,760
My fucking TPI is high enough!

768
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,420
Okay, let's see.

769
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,100
Change into options!

770
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,300
Change into options!

771
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,280
Okay, which one?

772
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,000
Which one?

773
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,900
Which one?

774
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,020
Am I Cody?

775
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm Cody, right?

776
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,400
You're Cody.

777
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,060
Yeah, okay.

778
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,000
Horizontal- Wait, which one?

779
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,180
Do I change it to- Okay, I'm changing it to 30.

780
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,840
It's not me!

781
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,340
I swear to God!

782
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,400
Oh wait, back.

783
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,600
Okay.

784
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,220
Okay, I'm ready.

785
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,500
Okay, we should restart this now.

786
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,320
We should restart it because I was drawing a line.

787
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,940
Like, see?

788
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,040
Look at us.

789
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,620
Look at us go.

790
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,860
Look at us go.

791
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,080
Alright, here we go.

792
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,060
Oh, it's very smooth.

793
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Uh-huh.

794
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,820
How the fuck did we progress to 6 out of 16?

795
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,600
So fast.

796
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,380
I don't understand how we did that.

797
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,640
Maybe we go left.

798
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,040
I don't know.

799
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,480
Maybe we go left instead of up.

800
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,280
Okay.

801
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:09,640
Okay.

802
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,860
And then- Oh my God!

803
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,320
We did it!

804
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,960
We have to go left!

805
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,440
Oh my God, we're making it.

806
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,080
We're doing it.

807
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,400
Go down.

808
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,100
Go down.

809
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,360
Oh my God, we progressed.

810
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,100
We got past 16.

811
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,160
This is so easy now.

812
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,380
Go up.

813
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,400
I am!

814
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,460
24.

815
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,500
What the fuck is this stupid drawing?

816
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,940
It's a cat?

817
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,440
How the fuck did it make a cat?

818
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,420
That's one ugly ass cat.

819
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,160
What the fuck?

820
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:37,600
Yeah.

821
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,580
How the fuck did we make a cat?

822
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,400
Look at

823
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:46,990
the mouse.

824
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:47,530
Ooh!

825
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,590
That's us.

826
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,370
Oh, these games.

827
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,150
I had one of these when I was a kid.

828
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,110
Mousetrap?

829
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,410
No, like the...

830
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,850
Oh my God, it's way too high now.

831
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,410
The sensitivity.

832
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,110
Give me a sec.

833
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,430
I'm going back down.

834
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,410
I'm going back down.

835
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,650
This is way too high.

836
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,170
Okay.

837
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:08,730
Nice.

838
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:08,990
Alright.

839
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,530
I'm good.

840
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,070
How do we do this?

841
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,470
I don't think those nails matter.

842
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,510
Matter.

843
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,290
I'm ready.

844
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,630
Wait, what are you doing?

845
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,970
Wait, what?

846
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,890
You have to press the button to let the mouse out.

847
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:28,890
Wait, we do?

848
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,150
Like here?

849
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,530
How?

850
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,930
I don't think we let it out now.

851
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,490
I think we have to do these first.

852
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,790
Like the ones in front of us first.

853
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,750
We have to do this because there's an objective point here.

854
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,910
Am I green or blue?

855
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,810
You're green.

856
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:47,970
Oh, I'm green.

857
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,570
Alright.

858
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,470
How do we do this?

859
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,410
Oh, we have to stand on there.

860
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:53,850
We have to stand.

861
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,430
Yeah, and then we go up.

862
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,090
Oh my god, we're doing it.

863
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,770
We're doing it.

864
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,950
We're working together as a couple.

865
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,390
Our divorce is not a mess.

866
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,490
Our marriage is salvageable.

867
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:09,990
Barely.

868
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,430
What?

869
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,730
Hey, hey, there's still hope.

870
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,650
That means there's still hope.

871
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,430
Yay!

872
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,290
See?

873
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,470
We can fix our marriage.

874
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,990
Look at us go.

875
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:27,890
Yeah.

876
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,250
Even if it's not fixable, it wasn't my fault that this marriage died.

877
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,070
What?

878
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,240
I'm just saying, I think I was the better parent.

879
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,480
Yeah, okay.

880
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,460
No!

881
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,840
That could have been a child.

882
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,880
What?

883
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,660
Did I get it?

884
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:02,460
What if that ball right there is our child and this is a metaphor of how we take care of it?

885
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,540
I'm already out there.

886
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,720
Woo!

887
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,120
I know, it's all about control, man.

888
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,900
Woo!

889
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,600
I did it!

890
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,180
Yay!

891
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,380
Where is the ball?

892
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,400
Where the fuck is the ball?

893
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,460
Oh, there it is.

894
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,800
Okay, now we push the thing.

895
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,150
Here we go, go get the cheese!

896
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,850
Here's the cheese, Mousy!

897
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,850
There it is!

898
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,530
Are you happy now?

899
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,030
Oh, that's torture.

900
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,630
That's actually torture.

901
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,690
What's this?

902
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,430
Oh!

903
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,590
What the heck?

904
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,830
Just move up.

905
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,790
And then, we have to make sure we jump fast enough.

906
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,410
But that's okay because we're gamers.

907
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,550
Ow.

908
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:56,790
.

909
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:03,630
Wait!

910
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,850
Wait up!

911
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,630
Wait up!

912
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,010
It's okay, we did it.

913
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,550
We're gamers.

914
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:12,630
.

915
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,890
Alright, hold on.

916
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,090
What do we do here?

917
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,950
Can we just jump on it?

918
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:24,950
Where do we go?

919
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,570
There's a rope thingy up there.

920
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,050
How do we get up there?

921
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,770
Wait, am I not supposed to wall jump?

922
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,150
I don't know.

923
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,190
Are we?

924
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,370
Oh!

925
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,110
Wait, what?

926
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,610
How do...

927
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,290
How?

928
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,270
I'm so confused.

929
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,430
Okay, I'm coming back.

930
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,170
Let's...

931
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:48,390
.

932
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,210
But like, how do we like...

933
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,570
.

934
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:54,610
.

935
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,690
Cause like, I can't do that though.

936
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:00,410
.

937
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,690
It's the side!

938
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,370
It's the side!

939
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:05,050
.

940
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,210
Yeah.

941
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:07,970
It's the side!

942
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:08,770
.

943
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,030
Yeah.

944
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,710
That's why I'm the gamer.

945
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,030
.

946
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,050
Yeah.

947
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:14,950
.

948
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,910
I figured it out.

949
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,450
.

950
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,370
I literally did that earlier.

951
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,910
I figured it out.

952
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:21,670
.

953
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,910
I did it.

954
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,190
.

955
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,550
Okay.

956
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:24,690
.

957
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,250
.

958
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,190
I did it.

959
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,710
Oh my god.

960
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,070
I'm a genius husband.

961
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,010
.

962
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,650
Any women would be lucky to have me.

963
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,170
.

964
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:39,490
Eww.

965
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,010
.

966
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,290
What?

967
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,350
.

968
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:41,670
.

969
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:41,670
.

970
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:47,470
What is this?

971
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:47,790
.

972
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,290
Oh, it's the whoopee cushion.

973
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:49,710
.

974
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,990
Other one, other one, other one.

975
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,230
.

976
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,430
Alright.

977
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:54,650
.

978
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:54,650
Okay.

979
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:54,830
.

980
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,690
I pumped it.

981
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,030
.

982
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,690
Wait, then what?

983
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,230
.

984
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,090
What are you doing?

985
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:00,850
.

986
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,910
Oh, okay.

987
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,650
I pumped it.

988
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,250
.

989
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,590
I pumped it.

990
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,030
.

991
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,890
I think you're supposed to land the other one.

992
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:08,130
.

993
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,150
Yeah.

994
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:08,990
.

995
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,350
I think you're supposed to...

996
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:10,610
.

997
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,410
Here and then...

998
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:12,990
.

999
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,090
There and then...

1000
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:15,130
.

1001
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:15,430
Oh, what?

1002
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:15,810
.

1003
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,650
Didn't you land on there?

1004
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,390
.

1005
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,850
Okay.

1006
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,090
.

1007
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:23,890
.

1008
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,090
Wait, what?

1009
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:24,450
.

1010
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,070
Can you not get there?

1011
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,750
.

1012
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,670
Wait, do you have to launch that one?

1013
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,150
.

1014
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,750
I don't know.

1015
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,230
.

1016
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,590
What was that for?

1017
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,530
.

1018
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:33,730
What?

1019
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,150
.

1020
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,790
Oh!

1021
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,250
Do we both have to?

1022
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:36,810
.

1023
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,130
Huh?

1024
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,410
I think it's possible.

1025
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,370
.

1026
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:39,370
Wait, I think we...

1027
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:39,370
.

1028
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,070
It says pull my finger though.

1029
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:42,790
.

1030
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,990
Wait, what does that mean?

1031
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:44,690
.

1032
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,110
.

1033
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,310
I'm letting you go up?

1034
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:47,310
.

1035
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,630
We both need to be on it.

1036
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,230
.

1037
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:49,750
And... what?

1038
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,250
.

1039
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,710
How did you... what?

1040
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:52,130
.

1041
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,770
How do I get there?

1042
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,510
.

1043
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,830
I can't get there.

1044
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:57,850
.

1045
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,010
Maybe you smash in and run over?

1046
00:40:59,250 --> 00:40:59,430
.

1047
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,650
No, because there's a timer.

1048
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,170
.

1049
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,030
Oh, maybe?

1050
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:02,890
Oh, maybe.

1051
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:03,390
.

1052
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,730
No?

1053
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,190
.

1054
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,690
Let's see.

1055
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,510
.

1056
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,830
Yeah, no, there's no...

1057
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:08,910
.

1058
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,470
There's like a delay.

1059
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,970
.

1060
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,370
Yeah, there's a delay.

1061
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:13,830
.

1062
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:13,830
.

1063
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,990
Oh!

1064
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,290
Wait, wait, wait!

1065
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:17,390
.

1066
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:17,490
Wait, wait, wait!

1067
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,310
Hold on.

1068
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:18,590
.

1069
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,190
Does pulling the finger make that spin?

1070
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,590
.

1071
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,770
No, why is it spinning?

1072
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,350
.

1073
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,170
Why is it pulled?

1074
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,770
What's activated?

1075
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:25,690
.

1076
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,550
Oh, wait, there's a thing over there!

1077
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:27,670
.

1078
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,110
Do you see that?

1079
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,670
.

1080
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,050
There was a thing on top.

1081
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:31,550
.

1082
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,490
Is that the...

1083
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:32,650
.

1084
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,490
Oh, yeah!

1085
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,370
There's a thing on top that's spinning!

1086
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:35,850
.

1087
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,910
There's a hook!

1088
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,530
I see it!

1089
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:37,950
.

1090
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,650
There's a hook!

1091
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,430
.

1092
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,150
Wait, wait, wait!

1093
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,850
Pull it, pull it!

1094
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,470
.

1095
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,230
Go here, go here.

1096
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:43,350
.

1097
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,450
There's a hook that shows up.

1098
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:44,830
.

1099
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,350
You'll see it.

1100
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:47,390
.

1101
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,330
There's a thing in there, and then there's a hook that shows up.

1102
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:49,450
.

1103
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,170
I see it now.

1104
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:51,670
.

1105
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,670
.

1106
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,070
Wait, see the hook?

1107
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,150
.

1108
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,230
There's a hook right there!

1109
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:56,250
.

1110
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,130
No, I knew about the hook!

1111
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,350
I tried to go for it earlier!

1112
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:58,890
.

1113
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,550
Yeah, but I think you're supposed to drop down after.

1114
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:00,570
.

1115
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,050
Wait, why do you keep... I did drop down!

1116
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:03,330
.

1117
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:03,330
Oh!

1118
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:03,790
.

1119
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,660
We figured it out together!

1120
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:10,920
.

1121
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,560
.

1122
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:11,920
.

1123
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,240
Yay!

1124
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,840
.

1125
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,320
.

1126
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,540
.

1127
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,320
.

1128
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,280
We did it!

1129
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:23,880
.

1130
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,320
Together!

1131
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:25,700
.

1132
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:25,700
.

1133
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,260
Because we are a lovely couple who's going through a rough patch.

1134
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:30,780
.

1135
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,220
Get on the...

1136
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,500
.

1137
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,960
Get on where?

1138
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,720
.

1139
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,180
Oh!

1140
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,540
.

1141
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,580
There you go.

1142
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,740
I'm on it.

1143
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,500
.

1144
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,840
Yay!

1145
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,360
.

1146
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,500
I pulled the thing.

1147
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:41,940
.

1148
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,580
Okay, I'm gonna head over.

1149
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:43,800
.

1150
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,460
Can you jump again?

1151
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,260
.

1152
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:45,260
.

1153
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,020
Alright, I'm on it.

1154
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:48,340
.

1155
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,980
We're a lovely couple.

1156
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,500
.

1157
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:51,860
I know.

1158
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,000
I know.

1159
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,360
.

1160
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,260
Everybody thinks so.

1161
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:54,940
.

1162
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,580
We think we're made for each other.

1163
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,260
.

1164
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,720
God, I hope they never say that again.

1165
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,360
.

1166
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,400
.

1167
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,400
We just have some little differences.

1168
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,180
.

1169
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,580
We just have some little differences.

1170
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:05,580
.

1171
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,200
Look, that's why... we should go to like therapy instead.

1172
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,800
.

1173
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:08,840
Look, that's why...

1174
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:08,840
we should go to like therapy instead.

1175
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:08,840
.

1176
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,520
You know, instead of... we should go to couples counseling.

1177
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,080
.

1178
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,500
Reddit, am I the asshole?

1179
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:13,740
.

1180
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,200
I hate my wife.

1181
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,480
.

1182
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,360
.

1183
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,300
But it's her fault.

1184
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,140
.

1185
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1186
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,480
.

1187
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:22,760
What's that?

1188
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,280
.

1189
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,060
Air dash?

1190
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,520
.

1191
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,620
What the fuck does that mean?

1192
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,240
.

1193
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,300
We just...

1194
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,540
.

1195
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,160
Where's the prize?

1196
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:29,680
.

1197
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,880
Give me something useful.

1198
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,340
.

1199
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,800
Just keep doing it?

1200
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,300
.

1201
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,080
Maybe we have to keep doing it.

1202
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,800
.

1203
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,240
What's this?

1204
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:38,700
.

1205
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,320
Air dash again.

1206
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:39,860
.

1207
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,160
That's it?

1208
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,240
.

1209
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,760
It has to be more, right?

1210
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,380
.

1211
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,560
Is that really it?

1212
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,020
.

1213
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,800
That's crotch.

1214
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:50,720
.

1215
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,540
It's crotch.

1216
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:52,620
.

1217
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,360
Oh my god, the watch.

1218
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,440
.

1219
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:55,940
.

1220
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,980
Is that crotch?

1221
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,220
.

1222
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,240
Oh, crotch!

1223
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:58,760
.

1224
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,800
I thought this says crotch.

1225
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,280
.

1226
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,060
I was like, what the fuck is crotch?

1227
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:03,800
.

1228
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,660
Yay!

1229
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,080
.

1230
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,180
Wait, we can swim?

1231
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:08,580
.

1232
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,460
What does this do?

1233
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:10,920
.

1234
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,120
Oh, we can swim!

1235
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:12,960
.

1236
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,000
Yay!

1237
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,680
.

1238
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:14,700
Oh!

1239
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:15,560
.

1240
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,400
Don't swim.

1241
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:16,840
.

1242
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,480
Don't swim.

1243
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,060
.

1244
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,040
I cranked this pipe all the way.

1245
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,440
.

1246
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
I don't know what I did though.

1247
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,360
.

1248
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,060
Don't swim.

1249
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,360
.

1250
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,640
Swimming was always a mistake.

1251
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:26,900
.

1252
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,460
Why did those balls fall?

1253
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,020
.

1254
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,880
No, the balls were always there.

1255
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:30,220
.

1256
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,340
Oh, we have to do this other one!

1257
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:31,680
.

1258
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,480
There's one over here.

1259
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,060
.

1260
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,000
I got it.

1261
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,720
.

1262
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,900
I'm pulling the lever.

1263
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,540
.

1264
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,040
Am I pulling it the right way?

1265
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,560
.

1266
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:43,960
It's spinning.

1267
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,300
.

1268
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,560
Oh, there it is!

1269
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:45,960
.

1270
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,480
Okay.

1271
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,140
.

1272
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,480
Teamwork!

1273
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:48,920
.

1274
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,220
Yay!

1275
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,020
.

1276
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,960
Alright, so we're going to couples counseling.

1277
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,740
.

1278
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,120
To fix our issues.

1279
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:55,680
.

1280
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,500
Oh my god, look!

1281
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:56,880
.

1282
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,960
Oh!

1283
00:44:59,460 --> 00:44:59,600
.

1284
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,780
It's an Etch-a-Sketch!

1285
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,040
.

1286
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,960
I used to own one of these.

1287
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:02,320
.

1288
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,460
Me too.

1289
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:03,840
.

1290
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,140
What are we trying to draw?

1291
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:05,560
.

1292
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:11,980
I don't know, but I think we just made like...

1293
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,080
.

1294
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,100
I don't know, but I think we just made like...

1295
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,460
.

1296
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,020
A Marvel logo.

1297
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,000
.

1298
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,420
.

1299
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,920
Now we just made Texas or something.

1300
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:19,980
.

1301
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,820
It's beautiful.

1302
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,800
.

1303
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,600
.

1304
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,500
What the fuck are you making?

1305
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:25,920
.

1306
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,280
It looks like Stonehenge.

1307
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:27,800
.

1308
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,840
I stopped touching the thing.

1309
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,660
.

1310
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,080
.

1311
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,120
.

1312
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,680
Wait, was that it?

1313
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:35,840
.

1314
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,220
It wasn't like an actual game?

1315
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:37,880
.

1316
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,720
Wait, we can make...

1317
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,100
.

1318
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,000
Shut up!

1319
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,740
.

1320
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,420
What was I going to say?

1321
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,480
.

1322
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,600
What was I going to say?

1323
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,000
.

1324
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,540
I don't know.

1325
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:51,860
.

1326
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,740
I just wanted to...

1327
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:52,780
.

1328
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,260
What was I going to say?

1329
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:54,460
.

1330
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,540
Clearly you think I'm going to say something.

1331
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:56,840
.

1332
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,440
What was I going to say?

1333
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:57,500
.

1334
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm going to put the last coin in.

1335
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,340
.

1336
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,320
I'm doing the teeth.

1337
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:01,920
.

1338
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,140
Oh my god, yay!

1339
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:03,880
.

1340
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,260
So cute!

1341
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:06,880
.

1342
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,880
Come over here.

1343
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,020
.

1344
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,320
I'm going to smash this.

1345
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:09,760
.

1346
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,060
I did five and I was okay.

1347
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,480
.

1348
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,720
I did five and I was okay.

1349
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:14,740
.

1350
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,080
It's your turn.

1351
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:16,700
.

1352
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,540
.

1353
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,380
Okay.

1354
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,000
Your turn.

1355
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:28,960
.

1356
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Nice.

1357
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,300
What is this?

1358
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:30,940
.

1359
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,820
It's like a little...

1360
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,080
.

1361
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,580
Our kid is like ten or some shit.

1362
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:35,800
.

1363
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,980
She should not be reading this.

1364
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:37,440
.

1365
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,180
Dude, I think these were her old toys.

1366
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:39,400
.

1367
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,520
Oh my god, game, game, game!

1368
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,980
.

1369
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,360
Game?

1370
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:41,740
Oh!

1371
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,540
What's this?

1372
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:42,860
.

1373
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,280
It's a bat time?

1374
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,020
.

1375
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,960
Swing a bat.

1376
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:45,980
.

1377
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,040
Swing a bat.

1378
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:47,400
.

1379
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,160
Oh, this will be a piece of cake.

1380
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:49,740
.

1381
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,620
Let me do this.

1382
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,060
.

1383
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:55,530
.

1384
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:55,530
Alrighty!

1385
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:56,330
.

1386
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,030
Oh.

1387
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:57,150
.

1388
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:57,390
Let it go!

1389
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:57,810
.

1390
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:58,050
Oh!

1391
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:58,670
.

1392
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,590
It took my ball forever to get that.

1393
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:02,070
.

1394
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,130
You just didn't hit it hard enough.

1395
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:04,770
.

1396
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:05,410
Oh god.

1397
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:06,730
I'm missing now.

1398
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:06,890
.

1399
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:06,890
Boom!

1400
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:07,390
You're out of here!

1401
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,850
.

1402
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,410
Please!

1403
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:08,830
.

1404
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,270
Look at that.

1405
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,390
I'm going so fast.

1406
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:10,710
.

1407
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,710
There you go!

1408
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:10,950
.

1409
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,630
It's because if you... No!

1410
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:14,310
Fuck!

1411
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:15,170
No, no, no, no!

1412
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:15,510
.

1413
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,210
It's because if you miss...

1414
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:17,670
.

1415
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,350
It's because if you miss... .

1416
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:18,770
It's true.

1417
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:19,150
.

1418
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,290
You have to like, have a...

1419
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:21,690
.

1420
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,450
It's true.

1421
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:22,450
.

1422
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:23,030
Have a rhythm.

1423
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:23,690
.

1424
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,190
Oh!

1425
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,190
Next!

1426
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:25,810
.

1427
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,730
The more you go, the faster you are.

1428
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:28,830
.

1429
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,110
I keep sending it backwards.

1430
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,610
.

1431
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,410
You hit it at the right angle.

1432
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,350
It's alright.

1433
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:33,810
.

1434
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:35,030
That's why I'm mansplaining.

1435
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:35,350
.

1436
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,150
Oh thank you, husband!

1437
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:37,710
.

1438
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,850
Oh husband, we can't afford rent.

1439
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:41,150
.

1440
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,770
You keep buying too many battle pass.

1441
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,150
.

1442
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,050
.

1443
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,070
I did it, wife!

1444
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,710
Are you proud of me?

1445
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:47,930
Please!

1446
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,050
Husband, please stop buying battle pass.

1447
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,210
We can't afford dinner.

1448
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,430
But I gotta get my John Cena!

1449
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,570
You wouldn't understand.

1450
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,530
You wouldn't understand, Rumi.

1451
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:04,310
Husband, please.

1452
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,390
But what about- who the fuck we bought fidget spinners?

1453
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,670
Your baby ain't hurt too much.

1454
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,870
In the real world, yes!

1455
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,390
Yeah, that's right.

1456
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:26,350
Gumi's not a gamer if she's trying to restrict my Fortnite passes.

1457
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,990
Husband, we need to eat.

1458
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:34,310
We could eat or...

1459
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,890
Or we could have the John Cena skin.

1460
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,990
Wait, what?

1461
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:46,630
I landed.

1462
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,570
Where do I have to go?

1463
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,650
Oh, over there.

1464
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,130
Where else would we go?

1465
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,110
I don't know!

1466
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,110
What?

1467
00:48:59,490 --> 00:48:59,810
Okay.

1468
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,070
That was weird.

1469
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,190
Alright, I got it.

1470
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,610
I'm twisting the knob.

1471
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,710
That's my special move.

1472
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:10,710
Ew.

1473
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,290
What?

1474
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:13,750
Why?

1475
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,190
Why did you use that?

1476
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,050
What did twisting this do?

1477
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,010
Why did you use that?

1478
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,110
I don't know, actually.

1479
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,010
What did it do?

1480
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,430
What does that open up?

1481
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,690
Oh, it's over to the...

1482
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:30,250
Can we have to go back there?

1483
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,350
Isn't it here?

1484
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,730
There's a... it's over here.

1485
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:34,910
Oh yeah, do that one.

1486
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,250
Yeah, there's one here.

1487
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,350
Alright, twisting the knob.

1488
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,550
Your favorite move.

1489
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:46,430
I'm gonna need you to stop coughing once and for all.

1490
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:47,690
I'm gonna need you to stop coughing once and for all.

1491
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:52,070
I don't understand!

1492
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:53,530
What did I say?

1493
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,310
What the fuck did I say?

1494
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,910
Twisting these knobs should turn this pipe off.

1495
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,710
Well, we have to find the yellow pipe.

1496
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,330
I found it.

1497
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,210
It's over behind us.

1498
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:06,230
What do you mean?

1499
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,510
We already did the yellow pipe.

1500
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:07,750
No, we didn't.

1501
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:08,730
We did the purple pipe.

1502
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,210
There's the yellow pipe right here.

1503
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:11,810
There, I got you.

1504
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:13,770
What was the purple pipe for then?

1505
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:14,710
I don't know.

1506
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:15,990
I mean, free up the red.

1507
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,010
What?

1508
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,010
It's free up the red.

1509
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,350
Oh, yeah.

1510
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:22,250
Nice.

1511
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:22,590
Okay.

1512
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,710
Then we head over there.

1513
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,210
Oh my god!

1514
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:28,950
Doki carry!

1515
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:29,550
I know!

1516
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:31,910
I'm carrying!

1517
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,550
I need a break from last week.

1518
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,030
What?

1519
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:35,490
What?

1520
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:38,870
Let's go to the beach!

1521
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:39,310
Beach!

1522
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:40,390
Yay!

1523
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,110
Ja ja!

1524
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:45,190
We bought our daughter a bouncy castle?

1525
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:47,450
You didn't go?

1526
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,090
We bought her a bouncy... Is this why we're having money issues?

1527
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,890
Hey, I make the money.

1528
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,390
You're the one that's in charge of home.

1529
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,650
And you've been spending it.

1530
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,650
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1531
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,650
There's no way I bought this for her.

1532
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,330
I'm too busy fucking farming.

1533
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,310
How the fuck...

1534
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,610
It can't be... I think it has to be you.

1535
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,650
You're trying to compensate for your lack of...

1536
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:15,950
Lack of what?

1537
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,050
Lack of presence in our daughter's life.

1538
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:22,130
You're trying way too hard to compensate for this.

1539
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:23,890
Yeah, okay, bud.

1540
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:31,890
You're like the one where you're at work like 20 hours out of the 24 hours.

1541
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,370
And then you come home with a bouncy castle.

1542
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,510
Wait, I had a bouncy castle when I was a kid.

1543
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,010
Yeah.

1544
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,070
Okay, don't think too hard about that.

1545
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,870
Don't think too hard about that.

1546
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,350
You mean it?

1547
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,450
I'm just talking about this game.

1548
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,550
It's not related to anything in real life.

1549
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,590
It's just... It's just about... It's just this game.

1550
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,110
I'm just talking about a hypothetical in this game.

1551
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,250
You mean it really?

1552
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1553
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,070
Wait, how do I...

1554
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,570
Oh, I have to smash it.

1555
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,220
Yay!

1556
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,400
I hate this guy.

1557
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:17,860
Me too.

1558
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:18,980
Oh, no!

1559
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,840
Oh, here we go again.

1560
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,300
My plan is working!

1561
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,700
You like each other more now!

1562
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,760
This guy fucking sucks.

1563
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,840
But there are more things to learn and new challenges to overcome!

1564
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,640
Let's keep on going!

1565
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,600
We got a relationship to fix!

1566
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,460
Woohoo!

1567
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,440
Woohoo!

1568
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,460
What the hell?

1569
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,620
Oh, God, that's trippy.

1570
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,840
Oh, I don't like this.

1571
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,380
I don't like this.

1572
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,760
I don't like that.

1573
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,380
Oh!

1574
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,420
I love kaleidoscopes.

1575
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,940
Oh, this is... Oh!

1576
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,320
I don't like this!

1577
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,220
Oh, my God!

1578
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,700
This is way too fucking trippy.

1579
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,320
This is actually way too uncomfortable.

1580
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,640
Why does everything have to be a rollercoaster?

1581
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,000
That would suck, actually.

1582
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,040
Haha!

1583
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,740
Dude, how the fuck... How long does this go for?

1584
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,760
Okay.

1585
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:24,980
Here we go.

1586
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,040
Is it like... Oh, does it... Maybe if I... Okay, no, don't jump off.

1587
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,280
Don't jump off!

1588
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:33,660
Oh!

1589
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,700
No, not that.

1590
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,220
What?

1591
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,720
We have to...

1592
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,540
What do I have to do?

1593
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,020
Me...

1594
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,520
Oh, wait, stand... Stand over there.

1595
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,520
Where?

1596
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:47,520
Here?

1597
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,640
Try and connect it.

1598
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:48,840
Yeah.

1599
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,640
No, one more.

1600
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,540
Oh!

1601
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:51,520
Oh!

1602
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,700
Oh, my God.

1603
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,100
This is why you're the engineer.

1604
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,720
Stand here, where I'm standing.

1605
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,440
Okay.

1606
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,520
Oh, my God!

1607
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,660
We're so smart together, sweetie!

1608
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,420
Nice stubby, hurt, hearty choke.

1609
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,660
Yeah, it's like a freaking double rainbow in here!

1610
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,420
Oh, my God!

1611
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,100
Double rainbow!

1612
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,640
What the fuck is that?

1613
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,640
What is that?

1614
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,000
That's us!

1615
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,820
Oh, my God!

1616
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,220
Double!

1617
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,580
Is that good?

1618
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,480
Now that there's two of us?

1619
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,260
No.

1620
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:28,920
Wait!

1621
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,220
Eiffel Tower.

1622
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,280
Where are we supposed to make... Go up.

1623
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,280
Go up top right.

1624
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,690
I did it.

1625
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:39,790
We did it!

1626
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:40,790
Yeah.

1627
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,670
And then...

1628
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:45,550
Whoa!

1629
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,530
Does that mean there's gonna be four of us?

1630
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,050
I don't know.

1631
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,390
My stubby hurt.

1632
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:52,110
Why?

1633
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,970
Is it because of the artichokes?

1634
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:54,610
Too much fiber.

1635
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,710
I told you not to eat all those artichokes.

1636
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,410
Oh, I don't like this.

1637
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,390
Oh, my God.

1638
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,270
I really don't like this.

1639
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,170
Oh... Oh...

1640
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:10,570
Oh, finally!

1641
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:12,990
How do we do this?

1642
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,210
Oh.

1643
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,130
Here we go.

1644
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,070
And then I guess I...

1645
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:24,790
Go from here?

1646
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:25,510
Oh, okay.

1647
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:28,130
I'm up.

1648
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:32,190
And then...

1649
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,210
Oh.

1650
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,250
I see it.

1651
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:34,970
I see it.

1652
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1653
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:36,370
There you go.

1654
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:39,590
And then what?

1655
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:40,750
Do I just bring you over?

1656
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,150
Oh, I bring you to the blue?

1657
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:44,950
Yeah.

1658
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,970
I think you can let go of it now.

1659
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,490
Yeah, but like... Oh!

1660
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:53,990
No, I can't.

1661
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:55,650
Yeah, you can.

1662
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,410
Oh, I... Oh, wait.

1663
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,650
You can.

1664
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,010
Okay.

1665
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:58,790
Okay.

1666
00:55:58,790 --> 00:55:59,510
I'm on it.

1667
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,250
And then we're here together!

1668
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:04,930
What do we do here?

1669
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,250
We push it together?

1670
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:08,330
Oh.

1671
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:08,770
Whoa!

1672
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,370
Whoa!

1673
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,750
Oh, we're refracting it.

1674
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,770
We're going up.

1675
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,870
What is happening?

1676
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:20,610
Kaleidoscope time.

1677
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,930
This is what's in your kaleidoscope.

1678
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,370
You little people.

1679
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,490
You're a doll, Cody.

1680
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:28,910
You're nothing to throw up.

1681
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:30,190
Oh!

1682
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:30,470
Ew!

1683
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,130
What the fuck was that?

1684
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,270
It's clay.

1685
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,330
I'm made of clay?

1686
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,590
I thought it was made of wood.

1687
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,530
You're sniffing it?

1688
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,230
I'm like a dog.

1689
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,670
You know it's healthy for a dog to...

1690
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:43,390
Oh, that's easy.

1691
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,850
We just have to get to the Magic Castle.

1692
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:45,130
Oh, God.

1693
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,510
Which I built, by the way.

1694
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:49,470
You built the Magic Castle?

1695
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:50,070
Yeah.

1696
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:52,990
Yeah, you're not the only one in the family who can build cool stuff.

1697
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,830
I built the Magic Castle?

1698
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,510
God, I'm so smart.

1699
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:57,350
Right over there.

1700
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,610
That'll take us straight there.

1701
00:56:58,930 --> 00:56:59,590
You're sure?

1702
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:00,850
Yes, I am sure.

1703
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,970
Would you just trust me?

1704
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:03,190
I'll try.

1705
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:03,930
Thank you.

1706
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,030
Can I go pee first?

1707
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:07,290
Okay.

1708
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:07,690
No.

1709
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:07,910
Come on.

1710
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:08,670
Let's clear the way for the hangar.

1711
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,350
What the hell?

1712
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,050
Don't say anything weird while I'm gone.

1713
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:17,190
Wait, what constitutes as weird?

1714
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,810
What's considered weird?

1715
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,950
Guys, what would be weird anyway?

1716
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,310
Oh my gosh, I got a little person right here.

1717
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:28,870
Whoop.

1718
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,770
This little person.

1719
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,150
What do I do with this?

1720
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,310
I shoot the plane?

1721
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,470
The fuck am I...

1722
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,510
I'm so confused.

1723
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,890
Oh, that's a telescope.

1724
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,690
I'm so confused without my wife.

1725
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,670
She knew what to do.

1726
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:49,050
All I did was take credit.

1727
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:54,970
The doki way.

1728
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:58,850
I was so good at one thing.

1729
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,130
And it was to just take credit.

1730
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,250
What do I do?

1731
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,190
Oh, hey, nice.

1732
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:09,030
I brought it over.

1733
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:09,290
Wait!

1734
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:10,770
That's so...

1735
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,050
Wait!

1736
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,910
Oh my god, I could just die with this thing and I'll bring it over.

1737
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,210
I assume that's what it's for.

1738
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,200
Say something weird?

1739
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:23,940
My existence.

1740
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,300
No!

1741
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,100
Did I cheese that puzzle?

1742
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,580
It's not cheesing, it's strats.

1743
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:36,860
Watch this.

1744
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,220
I pick it...

1745
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,400
I pick this guy up.

1746
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,860
I pick this guy up and I go down.

1747
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,340
Easy.

1748
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,320
I got everything.

1749
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:45,940
Right?

1750
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:46,920
That's all of them.

1751
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:53,980
It's okay.

1752
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,060
She's not here.

1753
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,120
She'll never know what I said.

1754
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,180
So I can continue to take credit for things I didn't do.

1755
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,540
That's the best part.

1756
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,020
Oh my god, guys!

1757
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,560
Today...

1758
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,440
Today...

1759
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,200
I finalized my skin suit design.

1760
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,880
Today I...

1761
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,320
Not today.

1762
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:14,940
Last night!

1763
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,560
At like 5 in the morning!

1764
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,340
I finalized it.

1765
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,860
I don't know if you guys are gonna like it but I don't have to worry about it anymore.

1766
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,780
Thank fucking god!

1767
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,100
I was like freaking out about shit for the longest time.

1768
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,880
So I'm just happy I don't have to think about it anymore.

1769
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,220
Oh yeah, Gumi tried to get me to play TFT.

1770
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,600
Because apparently she's like in this...

1771
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,580
Wait...

1772
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,140
Oh, did I cheese this?

1773
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,920
Cause like I already got the thing.

1774
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,680
Yeah, I cheesed it.

1775
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,740
Oh my god, that's how I did it?

1776
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,740
Oh yeah, and she was trying to get me to play TFT cause she has this TFT tournament or some shit.

1777
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,900
And I was like, Gumi, I can't even...

1778
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,940
I only played one game of TFT.

1779
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,340
And like there's no way I'm gonna play TFT cause the whole thing about TFT is reading.

1780
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,200
It is.

1781
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,260
It is.

1782
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,660
I was like, there's no way you're gonna get me to play TFT.

1783
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,420
I'm not gonna fucking read.

1784
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,520
It's... oh, it's like team...

1785
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,180
I almost said team fortress tactics.

1786
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,980
Team fight tactics?

1787
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:27,660
Right?

1788
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,500
Is that what it means?

1789
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,980
I don't have the brain capacity for that.

1790
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,640
All I do is just... I exist.

1791
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,340
My one weakness, reading.

1792
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:45,100
I don't have the brain power.

1793
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,880
What the fuck is she kissing?

1794
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,580
Is she kissing the mailman?

1795
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,360
Who is she trying to kiss?

1796
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,440
Who is she trying to kiss?

1797
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,080
The mailman?

1798
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,120
Woah, woah, woah!

1799
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,460
Choo!

1800
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,140
Oh my god.

1801
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,480
She's gonna kiss the mailman.

1802
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,300
How could she?

1803
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,100
In front of him?

1804
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,400
Right in front of him?

1805
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,680
Just like that?

1806
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,420
Oh, there you are.

1807
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,060
I did it!

1808
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:29,900
Gume!

1809
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,980
I fixed... I solved the puzzle!

1810
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:34,880
Really?

1811
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:35,520
Yeah!

1812
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,420
Now give me a kiss for a good job.

1813
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,180
Well done.

1814
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:41,560
Mwah!

1815
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,900
Wow, that was so hot.

1816
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,980
Oh my god, you're gonna get me excited.

1817
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,180
Ew!

1818
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,340
Why am I pee-pee hard?

1819
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,340
I want to go get some Tums because I hid them from myself.

1820
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,000
Why did you hide it?

1821
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,700
Because I have a Tums addiction.

1822
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,820
I think they're really yummy.

1823
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,340
What is it, Tums?

1824
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:05,700
It...

1825
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:07,800
Why?

1826
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,140
I don't know what Tums is.

1827
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,780
It's a... It's an anti-acid.

1828
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,100
Oh!

1829
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,340
Wait.

1830
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,100
Wouldn't that like fuck your stomach up?

1831
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,660
Because you're eating it out of pure enjoyment and not for...

1832
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,600
Yeah, no, you're only supposed to have seven maximum per day.

1833
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:23,960
Wait, what?

1834
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,740
And how much... how many do you have?

1835
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,360
Well, I usually eat seven per day.

1836
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,160
Oh, that is... whoa!

1837
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,500
That is not good.

1838
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,460
Oh, look, the dinosaurs!

1839
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,620
I've never had Tums before.

1840
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,680
So, I had to hide them for myself.

1841
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,780
Because out of sight, out of mind.

1842
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:40,620
Oh!

1843
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,300
Aww!

1844
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,020
What happened to you straight to the castle route?

1845
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,900
I didn't put the dinosaur there.

1846
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:47,720
Whatever.

1847
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,580
Let's just find a way to clear the track.

1848
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,140
What?

1849
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:51,700
How?

1850
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,660
I don't think I've ever had Tums.

1851
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,580
I just like... If I Tummy her, I just suffer.

1852
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:57,820
That one can help us.

1853
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,320
It only makes you stronger.

1854
01:02:59,780 --> 01:02:59,820
Well, any Tums also?

1855
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,720
Yeah, when I drink...

1856
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,880
Because it helps with the acid from drinking.

1857
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:06,700
Oh!

1858
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,920
Yeah, I don't drink a lot.

1859
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:08,660
That's why.

1860
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,400
What do we do here?

1861
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:11,380
What?

1862
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,620
I remember the last time we drank together.

1863
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,360
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

1864
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,140
I don't know if you remember, but that was a long...

1865
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:18,400
Yeah, you abandoned me.

1866
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,820
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

1867
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,620
Wait, what's this?

1868
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,840
You take the red one on the platform.

1869
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,660
Oh, there's a red one!

1870
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,120
Where?

1871
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:29,860
They were there.

1872
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,920
I just let him go.

1873
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,140
Oh.

1874
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,080
There you go.

1875
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:33,680
There's the Stegosaurus.

1876
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,680
Did you know that Brontosaurus is not a real dinosaur?

1877
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,840
What is it then?

1878
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:48,400
Like, apparently back then, when they made the Stegosaurus, they like, they like just pieced together random dinosaur bones.

1879
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,880
And then they're like, this is a Brontosaurus.

1880
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,180
Hey.

1881
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,900
Oh, that's not a Stegosaurus!

1882
01:03:55,100 --> 01:04:00,300
That's a... that's a... that's a... I don't know what the fuck that is.

1883
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:01,520
What?

1884
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,400
I don't know what it's called.

1885
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,360
Wait, I can't push that.

1886
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:06,500
You have to do it yourself.

1887
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,540
No, no, no.

1888
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,520
You have to pull it first.

1889
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:10,860
Oh!

1890
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,560
There you go.

1891
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,540
Where are our Jurassic Park enthusiasts here?

1892
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,680
But yeah, apparently like...

1893
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,280
Wait, I did... oh, I pulled it.

1894
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:34,520
But yeah, but like back then, when they did dinosaur stuff, they were like...

1895
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,860
They didn't know like...

1896
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:38,160
I can't grab it?

1897
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,060
Oh, because I didn't go down.

1898
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,920
There you go.

1899
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,100
I'm back!

1900
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,440
I'm back!

1901
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,940
Wait, what are you doing?

1902
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:46,800
No, you need to grab the other one.

1903
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,180
Oh, okay.

1904
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,760
No, I don't.

1905
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,380
But I do.

1906
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,000
There you go.

1907
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:54,760
Get on.

1908
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,480
Get on.

1909
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,080
Get on.

1910
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,760
My lady.

1911
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:09,260
Yeah?

1912
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,580
What do you do now?

1913
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,740
Bring me back.

1914
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,620
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1915
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,120
There you go.

1916
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:22,740
Okay.

1917
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,100
They said you were wrong.

1918
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,240
Grab that one.

1919
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,120
I grabbed it.

1920
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:30,520
Okay.

1921
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,600
Wait, I know you're supposed to wait for me to grab it.

1922
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,240
But back in the day, when they were constructing dinosaurs, like what we know about the dinosaurs.

1923
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:46,160
Back then was like mostly wrong because the scientists didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

1924
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,640
And they were just piecing random bones together until it made something.

1925
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,680
Can you grab that one?

1926
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,820
No, if I grab this one, the other one will disappear.

1927
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:56,460
Because you grab this and then you knock the other one.

1928
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,780
I think that changes it.

1929
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,800
Trust me.

1930
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:01,500
No.

1931
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,320
Trust me.

1932
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,420
Do my idea first.

1933
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:07,480
How about that?

1934
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,680
It's entertainment.

1935
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,140
You can entertain my idea first.

1936
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,820
And then like if I was right...

1937
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,860
If I was wrong, you can say I told you so.

1938
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,160
Okay.

1939
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,440
There you go.

1940
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:20,500
Wow.

1941
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:21,940
You were right.

1942
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,580
Wow.

1943
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,280
Wow.

1944
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:24,820
Wow.

1945
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:25,960
Wow.

1946
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,380
It's like I knew what I was talking about.

1947
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,240
And then...

1948
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,260
And then I'm going to grab onto this and you knock it.

1949
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,020
Wow.

1950
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,060
What was that?

1951
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,280
Who is that?

1952
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,960
Sorry I just really don't trust you.

1953
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,040
Okay, let me see.

1954
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,420
There's something...

1955
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,280
Grabbing.

1956
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:02,920
No.

1957
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,160
We have to...

1958
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,200
I have to grab onto the other one.

1959
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,700
Well, don't you want to grab onto them first?

1960
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,380
Well, I can't grab onto that.

1961
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,460
Because like, it's... you have to...

1962
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,240
What do you want to grab?

1963
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,040
Just hold on.

1964
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:23,460
Okay.

1965
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,540
Okay, well...

1966
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,140
Okay.

1967
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,100
Okay, I'm grabbing on.

1968
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,420
Grabbing onto this.

1969
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:30,640
Okay, let go.

1970
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,540
Let go.

1971
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,360
Alright.

1972
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,960
Hold the other one.

1973
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,740
Alright, I'm grabbing onto it.

1974
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:42,540
Okay.

1975
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,480
Okay, I already did it.

1976
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,780
Let me on!

1977
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,940
Let me on!

1978
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,280
Don't worry.

1979
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,120
I'm here.

1980
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,540
Look how cute this one is.

1981
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,660
The hero is here.

1982
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,740
Yeah, but do you have my size?

1983
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,780
Size isn't what matters, man.

1984
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,960
You taught me that.

1985
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,740
I said that.

1986
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,860
Wait, wait a minute.

1987
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,220
What do you mean I taught you that?

1988
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:08,720
I said that.

1989
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,540
I said that.

1990
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,160
I said that.

1991
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:13,840
Look at him.

1992
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:17,440
Oh, that's not my fault.

1993
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,640
Oh, that's not my fault.

1994
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,060
They totally saw that coming.

1995
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,480
Okay, don't worry.

1996
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:22,940
I got you.

1997
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:23,860
See, look at that.

1998
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,560
My guy is still alive.

1999
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:33,170
If your guy wasn't so small, he'd be alive.

2000
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:34,550
If your guy wasn't so small, he'd be alive.

2001
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:36,970
What the f... How did you miss?

2002
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:40,230
What the f... How did you miss?

2003
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:40,670
I'm not even that far.

2004
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,310
I thought you would wait for me to land on it.

2005
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,930
I thought I'd be able to bring you to the side.

2006
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:45,310
I don't know.

2007
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,310
You should know by...

2008
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:47,170
You're married to me.

2009
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:49,050
You should know by now how I play this game.

2010
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:53,210
You're married to me.

2011
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:53,210
You should know by now how I play this game.

2012
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:54,470
Oh, now you don't trust me.

2013
01:08:58,850 --> 01:08:59,750
There, I got you.

2014
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:02,890
What am I pulling up?

2015
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:06,270
What am I pulling up though?

2016
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:11,480
What is this?

2017
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,600
I'm making a second wall jump.

2018
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:13,460
Oh!

2019
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,360
Okay.

2020
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:18,600
Oh!

2021
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:20,860
Okay, I got it.

2022
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,860
I figured it out.

2023
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:24,220
Yay!

2024
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:24,820
Thank you.

2025
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,440
Your hero is here.

2026
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,160
Do not worry.

2027
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:29,700
I'm gonna go.

2028
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,240
I was afraid to call you a hero.

2029
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,280
Your hero is here.

2030
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,080
Oh my god, we gave him a concussion!

2031
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:38,740
We're monsters!

2032
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,100
That was fucked up.

2033
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:41,940
We're monsters!

2034
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,060
Ew!

2035
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,200
Where the fuck did the gas come from?

2036
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,580
Up we go!

2037
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:56,720
Yay!

2038
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,900
Do we have to have a sensitive nose?

2039
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,260
Do these players have...

2040
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,380
Do these characters...

2041
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:12,420
Do this mom and dad have friends outside of just the relationship?

2042
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,020
Do these characters...

2043
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,580
Like, do we have friends?

2044
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,620
I feel like...

2045
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,080
Oh my god.

2046
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:19,780
Oh my god.

2047
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,860
I feel like it's just us two.

2048
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,300
This is not healthy.

2049
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,960
We need friends outside of the relationship.

2050
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,640
We isolated each other.

2051
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,560
We isolated each other.

2052
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,460
We're like...

2053
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,020
You can't... I don't...

2054
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,140
I don't like Michael.

2055
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,900
You can't be friends with him anymore.

2056
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,940
If you have any guys on your friends list, you're gonna cheat on me.

2057
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,280
Can you delete all of them?

2058
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,600
I had a guy who actually did that.

2059
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:45,860
He made me...

2060
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,860
Do you want me to... Do you want to look at my phone too?

2061
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:49,680
Here!

2062
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:51,420
I have all my passwords!

2063
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,200
Here!

2064
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,420
This is all my passwords!

2065
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:53,700
Look!

2066
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,740
There's my password!

2067
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,660
There's my contacts!

2068
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:57,920
Are we...

2069
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,860
Are we bad for each other?

2070
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,540
I'm gonna go this way.

2071
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:08,640
I'm gonna do it.

2072
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:10,640
Ow.

2073
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,440
Yeah, don't sink it!

2074
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:17,860
Yeah!

2075
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:18,700
No!

2076
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,600
It's a group ember!

2077
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,040
Shoot the fucking octopus!

2078
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,680
What do you mean?

2079
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,280
I'm not the one for shooting!

2080
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,420
We both can shoot!

2081
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,160
Wait, we can?

2082
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,000
How do I shoot?

2083
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,140
Oh!

2084
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,340
Oh my god!

2085
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:36,980
I'm doing it!

2086
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,420
Oh my god!

2087
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,140
I'm doing it!

2088
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,620
I didn't realize that's how you shoot!

2089
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,000
We have to shoot this thing!

2090
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:44,640
We have to shoot this thing!

2091
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:46,620
Fireworks!

2092
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:47,100
Fireworks!

2093
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:47,980
Fireworks!

2094
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:48,160
Fireworks!

2095
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,240
Fireworks!

2096
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,400
Someone was like...

2097
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,280
Don't divorce!

2098
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,120
Don't!

2099
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,180
Mom!

2100
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:54,760
Dad!

2101
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:55,660
Don't do it!

2102
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,860
It's too late.

2103
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,560
It's your fault.

2104
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,000
Alright, I'm gonna kill this guy.

2105
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,760
I'm doing my part.

2106
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,360
I'm doing my part.

2107
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,720
Alright, here we go.

2108
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,440
We're doing it!

2109
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,660
Die, octopus!

2110
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,400
You don't even need to kill them to be fair, I feel like.

2111
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:26,840
I think so.

2112
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:27,940
Our ship has health.

2113
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:33,180
I think sometimes we can just ride past them.

2114
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,660
Is this the water level where you're gonna shoot a big octopus?

2115
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,180
Maybe.

2116
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,560
I hate those levels.

2117
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,820
Oh, I fucking knew it.

2118
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,880
We don't have to do this!

2119
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,660
We come in peace!

2120
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,880
I don't like their cannons.

2121
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,680
Who the fuck put water?

2122
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,140
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2123
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,240
I think we missed.

2124
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,100
We're a little too early.

2125
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,660
Oh, this is bad!

2126
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,560
This is bad!

2127
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,100
What do you mean, Doki?

2128
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:05,800
Doki?

2129
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,220
What do you mean?

2130
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:08,540
Doki?

2131
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,100
This is...

2132
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:10,880
What happened to...

2133
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,980
This is a group effort.

2134
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:12,800
What happened to that?

2135
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,540
I literally have never said that line.

2136
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,900
You're the one that kept saying that!

2137
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,500
You're the one that kept saying it!

2138
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:24,060
Now it's my fault just because we took a little damage!

2139
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,400
It's now my fault!

2140
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,220
I see you!

2141
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:32,240
I remember all the times you ran into the fucking...

2142
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,080
That is a pass!

2143
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,680
I'm a better person now!

2144
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,200
I'm a better person now!

2145
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:38,720
Really?

2146
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah, I've changed.

2147
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,120
You don't have to leave.

2148
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:44,920
I've changed.

2149
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:45,920
You fixed me.

2150
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,840
I promise I'll treat you better!

2151
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:50,900
You fixed me.

2152
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:51,860
Oh, penguins!

2153
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,300
Where do we shoot that one penguin over there?

2154
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,980
Straight into the icebox now!

2155
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,960
Oh, we can't shoot them.

2156
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,280
Don't worry.

2157
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,660
I wanted a voice.

2158
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,140
What?

2159
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,900
I didn't sign the prenup!

2160
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,260
You know what?

2161
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,560
That's more beneficial.

2162
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:12,960
Oh!

2163
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,740
Oh my god, you see it?

2164
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,100
What?

2165
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,300
Oh, the giant octopus.

2166
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,240
I see it.

2167
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,840
Wait, how do we...

2168
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,140
How do we dodge that?

2169
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,480
Oh my god!

2170
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,000
How do we do?

2171
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,700
Do we shoot it?

2172
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,040
Yeah!

2173
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:29,700
Oh!

2174
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,560
You didn't tell me!

2175
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,560
What happened to context clues?

2176
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,800
I felt like it was obvious.

2177
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,760
No, it was not.

2178
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,160
No, it wasn't.

2179
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,980
You know I need to be told what to do.

2180
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:39,920
You know I...

2181
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,600
You know damn well I'm a little special.

2182
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,260
And that's why you fell in love with me.

2183
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,580
And that's why you fell in love with me.

2184
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,460
This was arranged by your parents.

2185
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:54,980
They lost the bet.

2186
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,260
They lost the bet.

2187
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,120
Hey, Mr. Octopus!

2188
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,700
Don't listen to her.

2189
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,320
You are super cute!

2190
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,260
Hey, you're so...

2191
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,240
Nick Ryder!

2192
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:06,540
Ship!

2193
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:10,620
Oh!

2194
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,060
Whoa!

2195
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:15,780
Also, you're an engineer.

2196
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,860
You're so good at engineering.

2197
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,460
Fix our ship.

2198
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,940
Stop talking, Cody!

2199
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,200
And start shooting!

2200
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,560
It's the point of having that degree if you can't even fix our boat.

2201
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,320
It's a whirlpool!

2202
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,320
Oh!

2203
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,200
We're gonna shoot the...

2204
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:30,780
There we go!

2205
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,160
There we go!

2206
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:35,070
There we go!

2207
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:36,090
Okay, there we go.

2208
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:36,790
We're good.

2209
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:37,230
We're okay.

2210
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:38,750
Nothing to worry about.

2211
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:40,990
Keep firing!

2212
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,590
We're not panicking.

2213
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:45,550
Nothing to panic about.

2214
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:47,490
Oh god.

2215
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:47,930
Oh god.

2216
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,210
Alright.

2217
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:48,730
Nice.

2218
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:49,890
We gotta turn around now.

2219
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,690
I mean, it's pretty easy so far.

2220
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,830
Cause he has a giant head.

2221
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:58,250
Why do you say things?

2222
01:15:58,450 --> 01:15:59,730
Why do you say things?

2223
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:01,910
What do you mean?

2224
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:03,310
We got full HP now!

2225
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:04,590
Keep them away!

2226
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:04,970
See?

2227
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,290
Oh god.

2228
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:08,390
It's a duck with dynamite.

2229
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,930
Who the fuck gave a kid a dynamite?

2230
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:10,350
I heard it!

2231
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:15,250
Who the fuck gave this kid a dynamite?

2232
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,850
How does she know how to make a bomb?

2233
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,970
Why is it?

2234
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,030
No, I got her the castle.

2235
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:20,290
You're the engineer.

2236
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:21,510
This is engineer stuff.

2237
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,930
Why would a farmer know how to make a bomb?

2238
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:26,830
Why do you think I fucking engineered bombs?

2239
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:27,630
Oh god.

2240
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:28,650
Oh, wait.

2241
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:29,750
How the fuck do we...

2242
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:30,870
Oh, it's okay.

2243
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:31,950
It was just special effects.

2244
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:32,510
Oh yeah!

2245
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,690
You alright, mate?

2246
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:34,650
It was just a cutscene.

2247
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:35,850
Wait, there's more.

2248
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:37,050
There's a tentacle!

2249
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:37,510
There's a door!

2250
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:39,690
Okay.

2251
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,410
I don't think we can ignore that one guy.

2252
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:44,830
Cause he's just...

2253
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:45,630
He's just existing.

2254
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,740
Oh no.

2255
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,800
Not the flip.

2256
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,260
What the flip?

2257
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,600
Hey, have you seen that video that was like a monkey flipping and goes... What?

2258
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,620
And it had like American music to it?

2259
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,300
What?

2260
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,760
What do you mean by that?

2261
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,560
I like how this... You don't know monkey flip?

2262
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,260
No!

2263
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,340
I think you live on the internet a lot more than me.

2264
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:11,920
Oh, we're gonna get hit.

2265
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:13,780
I think we can just tank this and... Oh.

2266
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,420
I'm pretty sure we can just tank this and shoot the octopus.

2267
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:22,880
Yeah, there we go.

2268
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,900
Okay, let me get you monkey flip real quick.

2269
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:31,640
What the fuck is monkey flip?

2270
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:33,440
Monkey...

2271
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:34,320
Hold on.

2272
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,200
Monkey flip.

2273
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:39,980
I said in the real world it was cute.

2274
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,280
And did not try to kill me.

2275
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,380
Oh wait.

2276
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,880
I did buy her this.

2277
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,200
I'm a good dad.

2278
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,320
I care about my child.

2279
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,100
Because...

2280
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,560
He likes it.

2281
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,520
Here, I sent it to you.

2282
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:55,840
Monkey flip.

2283
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,100
Okay, what the fuck?

2284
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:57,520
It goes...

2285
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:57,680
Woah!

2286
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,660
This is what she sent.

2287
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,050
Okay.

2288
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:20,720
Okay, well you...

2289
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:26,600
I didn't realize that you were actually singing this song to monkey flip.

2290
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:34,400
I just realized my fucking chrome tablet's off.

2291
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:39,660
No!

2292
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,800
I swear!

2293
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,300
I swear if I get DMCA'd...

2294
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,340
I swear...

2295
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:49,180
I get DMCA'd because of... I fucking...

2296
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:49,900
I'm fucking swag!

2297
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,740
That's not my fault.

2298
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
What do you mean you sent me the link?

2299
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,680
You had the chrome tablet.

2300
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,060
I didn't realize I had my chrome on.

2301
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,680
It was so high.

2302
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,520
Sound guy, fix it.

2303
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,480
I replayed it.

2304
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:16,640
It was guaranteed.

2305
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,680
This is kinda like that haunted house.

2306
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:18,980
Monkey.

2307
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,240
Monkey flip.

2308
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:25,460
Every time we flipped into Octopus, that's when my brain went...

2309
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:25,700
Woah!

2310
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:26,460
Woah!

2311
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,560
I just hope we survive this ride too!

2312
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,500
How are we still not finished with this chapter?

2313
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,260
What the fuck is this level?

2314
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,420
The bridge isn't supposed to be up!

2315
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,300
Gosh, it's winched by a balloon!

2316
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:42,760
Hey, that's Rosie's balloon!

2317
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,260
Who the fuck uses the word winched?

2318
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,320
Oh yeah, I hate that creepy balloon.

2319
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,820
Why'd you have to buy her that?

2320
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:48,200
Yeah.

2321
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:49,680
Why?

2322
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,280
See, not everything's my fault.

2323
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:53,980
Oh god.

2324
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,000
Oh, what the fuck?

2325
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,100
What parent would buy this for their child?

2326
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,780
What millennial parent would buy this for their child?

2327
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,800
Dude, don't we look like millennials here?

2328
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,040
Dude, don't we look like millennials here?

2329
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,540
I'm saying, why would millennials buy this?

2330
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,440
Millennials won't buy this.

2331
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,220
They'll just buy an iPad.

2332
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,240
I'm pretty sure this was before iPads existed, man.

2333
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,540
There's no way.

2334
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,540
Rose gave the elephant a crown.

2335
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,620
You know, a queen's crown.

2336
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,800
Dude, we live in a fucking farm.

2337
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,360
Yeah, I guess so.

2338
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,080
It's her favorite toy.

2339
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:27,900
Oh, perfect.

2340
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,120
So now we're killing a queen.

2341
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,340
Pardon me, killing who?

2342
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:32,880
No, no, no, no, no.

2343
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:33,820
She said chilling!

2344
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,580
This was made before Queen Elizabeth.

2345
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,360
Yeah, chilling with the queen we are really looking forward to.

2346
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,260
Okay, that does not mean much.

2347
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:40,920
Chilling with her, right?

2348
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,560
I see.

2349
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:47,220
Well, our visitors must prove themselves worthy of an office visit.

2350
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,620
So, let's get the audience with the queen.

2351
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,500
Get a ball over there.

2352
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:54,100
And use it to pop the balloon.

2353
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:56,300
And then you will...

2354
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,140
This is messed up.

2355
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,160
Why is she helping us kill the queen?

2356
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:00,480
Thank you!

2357
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,600
Is the queen that bad?

2358
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,340
She doesn't know we're killing the queen, man.

2359
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,560
Okay, but it could be implied.

2360
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:09,780
We literally... the storyline talked about that.

2361
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:11,280
They said we're chilling with the queen.

2362
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,320
Yeah, but like...

2363
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,620
Did she really believe that?

2364
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,680
Oh, I don't have to be there.

2365
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:19,980
Wait.

2366
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,820
Oh, and then we do this.

2367
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,120
And then it goes over to the other side.

2368
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,160
Oh, we did it!

2369
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:33,920
This is...

2370
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,720
We have to run.

2371
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,400
Are you ready?

2372
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,020
I'm ready.

2373
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,820
Wait, did you not do the thing?

2374
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,500
I'm holding the ball.

2375
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,620
I'm holding it.

2376
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,240
You have to turn the wheel to the right.

2377
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,760
Okay, I got it.

2378
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,700
I figured it out.

2379
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,140
Together with my lovely wife.

2380
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:57,800
Look at the sea!

2381
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,800
Oh, look at the sea!

2382
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:10,930
Okay, I...

2383
01:22:11,790 --> 01:22:15,470
I just want to enjoy this beautiful view a little longer.

2384
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,850
Have you ever watched the Cirque du Soleil?

2385
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:20,530
What play?

2386
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:21,190
The circus.

2387
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:22,630
Oh, yeah.

2388
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,910
I went and saw Cirque du Soleil.

2389
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:30,770
Okay, I saw Cirque du Soleil two times in my life.

2390
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:32,750
And the fucked up thing...

2391
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,130
Okay, you know how Cirque du Soleil...

2392
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:35,190
Okay, I have to look this up.

2393
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:39,510
But Cirque du Soleil has lots and lots and lots of shows.

2394
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:40,290
Did I fuck up?

2395
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:43,390
Wait, you missed.

2396
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:45,730
Okay.

2397
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:50,710
Okay, let me try that again.

2398
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:53,910
Did you get the other balloon?

2399
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,090
Yeah, you have to aim at the one between the bars.

2400
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,070
Or you can aim at that one.

2401
01:22:59,610 --> 01:22:59,850
Oh.

2402
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:01,450
Oh, okay.

2403
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:02,810
Maybe you should.

2404
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,770
Maybe you're better at this than me.

2405
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,460
Maybe you're better at this than me.

2406
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:13,860
Oh, are you sure?

2407
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,920
I literally did not say a word and you're just talking to yourself.

2408
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,280
You're literally just talking to yourself.

2409
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,580
I don't know what to tell you.

2410
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,780
You're like, oh, maybe you're better than me.

2411
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,180
Are you sure?

2412
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,300
I didn't say a single line.

2413
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,620
Are you sure this is how you're supposed to do it?

2414
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:35,840
Are you sure this is how you're supposed to do it?

2415
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,280
I don't think you can go through that.

2416
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,560
Oh, maybe we have to curve it through the side.

2417
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:42,560
I don't think you can.

2418
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:48,720
I think we're supposed to do that the one to that one first and then that's gonna open the gate.

2419
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,600
Why would you shoot me now?

2420
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,620
Because I'm timing it.

2421
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,320
There, see?

2422
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:51,940
Look at that.

2423
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:55,860
I timed that fucking perfectly!

2424
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,000
You know timings?

2425
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,660
Oh my god!

2426
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,600
I actually timed that perfectly!

2427
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:01,820
What are you doing?

2428
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:04,840
I didn't know you knew timings, man.

2429
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,780
That's gonna close the moment you get there.

2430
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:12,500
Wait, what?

2431
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:13,980
What?

2432
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,700
No, we have to get the center.

2433
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:18,720
There's the center right there.

2434
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,100
I...

2435
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,560
Why did you not see me hit that button?

2436
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:24,400
Why did you not see me hit that button?

2437
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:24,520
No, I did!

2438
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:24,520
I did!

2439
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,220
But I'm saying, there's also this one that we have to get.

2440
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:30,800
Okay, anyway, so...

2441
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,680
I saw Cirque du Soleil has like...

2442
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,240
60 plus shows.

2443
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,760
60 plus fucking shows.

2444
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:44,980
And like, I remember going to the first Cirque du Soleil when I was like really, really, really little.

2445
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,020
And...

2446
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:48,200
I really enjoyed Cirque d'Art.

2447
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,100
Because it was like my first Cirque du Soleil.

2448
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,360
So I was like, alright.

2449
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:52,460
Uh...

2450
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,740
I wanna buy the CD of it.

2451
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,180
So then I had it in my...

2452
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:01,140
I had it in my iTunes for like years and like 10 plus years.

2453
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:01,940
Maybe longer.

2454
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,580
Maybe like 15 plus years.

2455
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,840
And I would listen... It would come up in my playlist ever so often.

2456
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,440
Because I still have my, you know, I listen to it on my iPhone.

2457
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,280
Like, I always sync it up on my iPhone.

2458
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,740
And then... And then, I was...

2459
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:18,280
Luckily enough, I was able to watch a new Cirque du Soleil.

2460
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,480
Um...

2461
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,140
A new Cirque du Soleil.

2462
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:21,960
And...

2463
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,720
I didn't realize like what show it was.

2464
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,380
I was just like, oh Cirque du Soleil.

2465
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,080
Clearly it will be like a new show.

2466
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,040
I listened... The first act.

2467
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:37,240
It was the same show I watched 15 plus years ago.

2468
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:43,280
Like I somehow was able to go back and watch that same show.

2469
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,700
15 years ago!

2470
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,500
When there is...

2471
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,440
That's not new.

2472
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,040
That's not...

2473
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,560
I didn't even move my entire thing.

2474
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:55,860
I did not move nothing.

2475
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,700
There is 16 plus Cirque du Soleil shows.

2476
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,240
And I somehow was able to watch the same one.

2477
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:05,680
Like how?

2478
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,380
How is that possible?

2479
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:10,620
I'm sorry.

2480
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:11,600
I had to talk about it.

2481
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,260
It actually pissed me off when I found out.

2482
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,240
No, I don't know.

2483
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,160
Honestly, I can't even remember Cirque du Soleil.

2484
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,460
I feel like my mom like fell asleep during it.

2485
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,900
I only remembered because I was like the first act.

2486
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,020
I was like, wait a minute.

2487
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,180
I know this song.

2488
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:28,600
I was like, why would I know this song if I haven't fucking watched it?

2489
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:33,120
If I haven't had that song those songs in repeat for so long.

2490
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,400
Where do we go?

2491
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,260
Oh, I have to pass it to you.

2492
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,040
Are you ready?

2493
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,040
Catch!

2494
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,180
Oh my god.

2495
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:41,940
We're so good.

2496
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,520
It's like we're gamers.

2497
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,440
That's nice, honey.

2498
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,200
Is that an American thing?

2499
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:53,940
I have no idea.

2500
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,400
No, it's a circus thing.

2501
01:26:56,580 --> 01:27:03,000
Cirque du Soleil is like one of the biggest circuses in the world.

2502
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:09,140
And I somehow was able to watch the same show twice with a 15 plus year gap in between.

2503
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,280
Like, I don't know how it was possible.

2504
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,780
But like I somehow was able to do it.

2505
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:26,090
Honestly, I did not... Oh, what the fuck?

2506
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:26,530
We did it.

2507
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:28,290
We weren't even coordinating that.

2508
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:29,290
Oh my god, it looked at us!

2509
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:32,590
It looked at us before it died.

2510
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:35,250
We will.

2511
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:36,750
Thanks for your help.

2512
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:38,110
Yeah, thanks a lot.

2513
01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:39,530
Let's get to the castle.

2514
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:48,390
Yay, we committed mur... I feel like he would know we're committing murder now after we killed that balloon.

2515
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:55,610
Still can't believe I watched the same show.

2516
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:58,530
Honestly, why did that person let us do that?

2517
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:01,410
Maybe she really hated that clown.

2518
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,710
Maybe that clown was a fucking asshole.

2519
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:05,310
I mean, look at him.

2520
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:06,790
He looks like an asshole.

2521
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:10,110
Why do we have to kill the queen?

2522
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,090
Too many taxes.

2523
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:14,270
Okay.

2524
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:16,010
Viva la France.

2525
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:17,870
What?

2526
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:21,010
What?

2527
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,330
You don't know French history?

2528
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:25,310
Hold on, you said you never finished building the chat.

2529
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:26,710
No, it's more like...

2530
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,290
I just did not expect you to see that.

2531
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:32,810
It's time for the revolution.

2532
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:40,230
It's time!

2533
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:41,930
Get the guillotine!

2534
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:44,970
Oh my god, they must have guillotines!

2535
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:46,350
This is medieval times now.

2536
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:46,990
Oh my god, no!

2537
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:48,570
Honestly, hold on.

2538
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:51,030
If I had to die... Yeah?

2539
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:54,350
If you if.

2540
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:59,670
If I got to choose how I would die...

2541
01:28:59,670 --> 01:28:59,750
Yeah?

2542
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:02,550
I would want to go buy a guillotine.

2543
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:03,530
What the fuck?

2544
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:03,810
Why?

2545
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,110
Do you know like you can like...

2546
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:08,730
Like the head starts... You know you still process like 10 seconds?

2547
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:10,450
Hey.

2548
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:11,530
Why?

2549
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:13,490
Why a guillotine?

2550
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:13,810
Okay, hear me out.

2551
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:14,670
Hold on, hear me out.

2552
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:14,910
Okay.

2553
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:17,030
It would be so cool.

2554
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:18,510
Like I'm not gonna die from old age.

2555
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:21,870
I would go buy guillotine and I would DYI it.

2556
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:22,870
I would make my own.

2557
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:26,970
You know like if you make your own, it doesn't guarantee that you're gonna get the slice right.

2558
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:27,450
And?

2559
01:29:27,470 --> 01:29:28,250
Hold on.

2560
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:32,670
And I would trademark that shit and name it the guillotine.

2561
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:35,190
The guillotine?

2562
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,910
What the fuck would you... It already exists.

2563
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:41,590
Like you can't trademark something that already exists.

2564
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,370
What is... No.

2565
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:46,370
What is the guillotine gonna look... How is the guillotine gonna look different?

2566
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:47,310
Hold on, hold on.

2567
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:47,870
Hold on.

2568
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,110
I'll show you.

2569
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,710
The guillotine has something different to it.

2570
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:52,130
Are you ready?

2571
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:52,730
Yeah, okay.

2572
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,230
I'm gonna draw for you real quick.

2573
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:56,930
You're gonna draw for me real quick.

2574
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,990
So, the average guillotine... Here, I'll even square it.

2575
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:03,990
Okay.

2576
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:05,010
Okay.

2577
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,030
Well, let me see...

2578
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:09,750
See what this is.

2579
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:12,410
Alright.

2580
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:26,270
So, the guillotine, it's usually like this, and then it's like this, and then it's like this, and then it has like this blade here.

2581
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,050
And then you put your little head here.

2582
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:30,650
Right?

2583
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:32,790
And then they usually have a bucket to catch the head.

2584
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:35,130
A bucket?

2585
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:35,710
What?

2586
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:37,590
Oh, you mean like a bucket to catch the...

2587
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:38,610
to catch the head.

2588
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:39,010
The head.

2589
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:39,610
Yeah.

2590
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:41,530
But that's what the normal guillotine has.

2591
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,610
Yeah, that's the normal guillotine.

2592
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,810
But this is the guillotine.

2593
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:46,490
First of all, it would have little ears.

2594
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:51,060
Okay?

2595
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:52,120
Let's get that straight.

2596
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:55,560
And then...

2597
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:01,200
Instead of a normal blade, the little blade would have little teeth.

2598
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:03,100
And it would look like this.

2599
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:06,420
And then...

2600
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,500
And then...

2601
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,980
It would be right here.

2602
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,660
And that would be me.

2603
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:14,580
And that would be me.

2604
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,060
That would be...

2605
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:16,260
Try yourself!

2606
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,360
What the fuck?

2607
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,880
That would be me.

2608
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,400
And then, hold on.

2609
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,500
I can't see it yet!

2610
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,320
What do you mean?

2611
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:31,960
The string would be a little dog treat.

2612
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,200
The what would be a little dog treat?

2613
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,560
You know the like pulley thing?

2614
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,120
How you pull it to make those...

2615
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:39,460
Oh!

2616
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,520
Oh, so the dog...

2617
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,280
You won't know exactly when.

2618
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:47,340
It's whenever the dog decides to pull... That's so fucked up.

2619
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:51,660
That is actually so fucked up.

2620
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:57,620
So the only thing different about it is that it's controlled by a dog.

2621
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So you're trying to say it'll make people feel less bad because a dog did it?

2622
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:02,940
Is that why?

2623
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:03,900
No!

2624
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:03,900
No!

2625
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:04,240
No!

2626
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,480
I'm not gonna make a dog do it.

2627
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,220
It's just bone shaped.

2628
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,620
It's just bone shaped.

2629
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,460
It's just like branding.

2630
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:17,220
You're not trademarking the guillotine because you're just branding it.

2631
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,600
It has freaking teeth and everything!

2632
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,920
It's just like you put on a Fortnite skin on it.

2633
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:23,840
It's still Fortnite.

2634
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,980
You put on a gooby skin on it.

2635
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,120
It's still a guillotine.

2636
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,400
It's still... Who trademarked a guillotine?

2637
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,380
Who trademarked a guillotine?

2638
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:35,920
It would be fucked up if somebody trademarked a guillotine.

2639
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,680
So every time you use a guillotine you have to pay.

2640
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:42,840
You have to pay the trademark rights to it.

2641
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:47,840
That's why we don't even have... Wait, the guillotine is trademarked as a game.

2642
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,260
Wizards of the Coast!

2643
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:51,800
Wait!

2644
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,300
Dungeons and Dragons trademarked the guillotine!

2645
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,000
What the fuck?

2646
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,380
Okay, but they can't trademark the goomy teen.

2647
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:01,720
Oh my god!

2648
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:07,180
Magic the Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons trademarked the guillotine!

2649
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,420
That's so fucked up!

2650
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,780
Why did they...

2651
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:11,120
Hold on.

2652
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:13,940
What if I add a thing?

2653
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:15,960
Instead of a bucket?

2654
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,140
Yeah, you...

2655
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:20,440
It's already trademarked.

2656
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:21,040
You can't do it.

2657
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,980
No, they can't trademark the goomy teen!

2658
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:23,640
It's different!

2659
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:24,920
It's a skin!

2660
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:28,940
You see people trade my shit like Fushigi!

2661
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:31,240
Fushigi is just a weird weighted ball!

2662
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:32,120
Or like...

2663
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:32,800
Whoa!

2664
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:38,060
Whoa!

2665
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:44,940
Damn, you're so passionate about the Magic Gravity Ball!

2666
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,500
What the fuck?

2667
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,260
Why did you bring up that?

2668
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,380
The most obscure shit ever!

2669
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,840
Why did you bring it up?

2670
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,000
Goomy, start the game!

2671
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:08,220
Start the fucking game!

2672
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,220
And pause the game!

2673
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:14,700
I think you've cooked long enough!

2674
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,920
I think you've cooked long enough!

2675
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,520
You never even showed me the goomy teen!

2676
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,800
You drew all that out and I never got a chance to see it!

2677
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:24,820
That's the goomy teen!

2678
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:27,560
You never even showed me the goomy teen!

2679
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,680
On the right hand side!

2680
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,340
What do you mean the right hand side?

2681
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,420
You sure did!

2682
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:35,640
I showed you my drawing!

2683
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,100
No you did not!

2684
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:37,880
No you did not!

2685
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,180
I did not see it!

2686
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,020
You did not show...

2687
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:41,840
I guess it didn't screen share properly.

2688
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,600
You were screen sharing?

2689
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,520
Yeah, I was!

2690
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,820
I was gonna screen share!

2691
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,380
Sorry I wasn't listening.

2692
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,920
I thought you were gonna screen share it.

2693
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:57,000
I thought you were gonna screen share it.

2694
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:00,580
I didn't realize you still have the picture.

2695
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:00,760
I didn't realize you still have the picture.

2696
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,340
Can you screen share it for me?

2697
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,100
No I already closed paint!

2698
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,080
Get down!

2699
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,560
You'll never see the goomy teen!

2700
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,860
It looks so different!

2701
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:13,160
It looks so different!

2702
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,040
I was like why does she not see this?

2703
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,660
Okay there's a game here.

2704
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:19,800
It's a true game.

2705
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:21,040
It's a train track too!

2706
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,620
Wait what the fuck?

2707
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,460
Is this squeeze the bird to make it sing?

2708
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,080
Oh!

2709
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,560
I think it's a...

2710
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,560
What is this?

2711
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:31,480
Oh bird star!

2712
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,080
World star!

2713
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,560
Oh!

2714
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,620
It's like a rhythm game.

2715
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:41,300
Whatever rhythm.

2716
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:42,060
Kinda cute.

2717
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:45,400
Bump!

2718
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:46,320
Bump!

2719
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:48,280
Bump!

2720
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,200
When does it get harder?

2721
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:49,860
Easy!

2722
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:51,040
I don't know.

2723
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:53,160
Well done birdie!

2724
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,820
This is so easy.

2725
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,080
Bring it home!

2726
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,440
I need to eat another tub.

2727
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,180
Bump!

2728
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:00,380
Bump!

2729
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:00,620
Bump!

2730
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:00,880
Bump!

2731
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:01,220
Bump!

2732
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:01,420
Bump!

2733
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:01,660
Bump!

2734
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,020
Oh fuck!

2735
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:05,100
I didn't realize you can't spam it!

2736
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,700
Oh no!

2737
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,940
Oh god it's getting too hard!

2738
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:12,760
It's getting too hard!

2739
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:13,580
Yes!

2740
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,780
Here is team bluebird!

2741
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,880
I'm not that good at rhythm.

2742
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:21,360
I'm not that good at rhythm.

2743
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,480
It's okay.

2744
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:23,620
It's okay.

2745
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,840
I'm good at other things.

2746
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,060
That's why you marry me.

2747
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:28,380
Yeah.

2748
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,980
Oh I don't have a birthday party!

2749
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,700
It's like somebody's birthday.

2750
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:35,820
Hurry help!

2751
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:37,420
Give me a sec.

2752
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,840
I'm ruining somebody's...

2753
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:40,740
I'm ruining somebody's birthday.

2754
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:43,100
That's fucking right.

2755
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,140
Management did not give you a birthday.

2756
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:45,460
Oh!

2757
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,000
I love a birthday!

2758
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:47,480
What story is that?

2759
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:49,840
Oh you're helping.

2760
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,340
He's been a sticky white subject.

2761
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:53,180
What the fuck?

2762
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:54,620
Oh wait!

2763
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:55,040
Look!

2764
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:55,940
He's in the other one!

2765
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:59,020
Yeah I think it's over for him.

2766
01:36:59,160 --> 01:36:59,360
Yeah I think it's over for him.

2767
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,280
No it's okay!

2768
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:00,960
I got you!

2769
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,420
Why are you always in the sticky substance?

2770
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,580
What is that anyway?

2771
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:06,920
Oh yeah it's over.

2772
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:07,820
He is a pattern.

2773
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,420
I can't believe you ruined their birthday.

2774
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:12,440
I can't believe you ruined their birthday.

2775
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,160
I didn't ruin it.

2776
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:15,180
Management said they're not allowed to have a birthday.

2777
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:16,280
Alright!

2778
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,860
Let's see if we can get a better view of the castle.

2779
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:19,980
Where are you going?

2780
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,600
I'm on the team.

2781
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:23,620
Choo choo!

2782
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:29,780
This is like...

2783
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:30,540
Oh!

2784
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:31,520
Oh my god!

2785
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,080
This is a huge area.

2786
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,260
Oh there's a printer!

2787
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,100
There's paint!

2788
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:38,980
What the hell?

2789
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,420
Oh my god!

2790
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,300
I'm making art!

2791
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:46,740
I'm making beautiful art!

2792
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:47,280
Oh!

2793
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:49,100
It's so beautiful!

2794
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:51,900
Beautiful is not the word I would use for that.

2795
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,040
It's so beautiful!

2796
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,400
You're not even looking!

2797
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,800
You're on your fucking train!

2798
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,780
It's like you love the train more than me.

2799
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:57,260
Choo choo!

2800
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,000
Maybe I do!

2801
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,320
That's fucked up.

2802
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,820
How would you ever say that?

2803
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:08,180
What can the train do that I can't?

2804
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:08,240
Oh lord!

2805
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:09,900
I'm working right now.

2806
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:12,100
What can the train do that I can't?

2807
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:12,740
I don't understand.

2808
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:12,920
I don't understand.

2809
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,920
What are we supposed to do here?

2810
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:20,100
The gate's locked!

2811
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:21,840
But there's got to be a way in!

2812
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,340
Is there?

2813
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,960
I think I found what we're supposed to do.

2814
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,560
But like, what if I just want to live here?

2815
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:30,620
It seems like a good place to live.

2816
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:32,960
Uhhh...

2817
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:34,140
CPS?

2818
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,360
Evidence number...

2819
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:36,960
27.

2820
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:41,100
Why are you calling it on us?

2821
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,060
I'm calling it on you!

2822
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:45,640
You can't because it's a group effort.

2823
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,400
If I fuck up as a parent, it's on you too.

2824
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:50,540
Why do you keep saying that?

2825
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,240
So we got this big crane here.

2826
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,000
I'm sure it could be useful for this gate.

2827
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:56,180
God, go down.

2828
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:57,660
Oh, interior.

2829
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,080
It's a group effort.

2830
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,300
We can't fuck it up individually.

2831
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:04,780
We have to fuck it up as a team.

2832
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,280
Why are you moving it that way?

2833
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:10,680
Oh, it's Jenga!

2834
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:12,340
Satisfying!

2835
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,920
Wait, what's the point of that?

2836
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:18,800
There was no point.

2837
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:19,800
We had to do this anyway.

2838
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,920
No, I couldn't go the other way.

2839
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:21,220
Oh!

2840
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,540
You're crazy!

2841
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,580
How do we push it?

2842
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,500
Did you hear him?

2843
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:30,420
No, I don't...

2844
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,980
He said you're crazy, but I like it.

2845
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:32,440
Woah!

2846
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:34,400
I can fix her.

2847
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,800
Oh, I have to jump in.

2848
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:38,220
Jump in!

2849
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,740
We have to move it together.

2850
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:48,280
Oh, so you're the crazy one and I'm trying to fix you.

2851
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:51,620
Okay, okay.

2852
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:53,660
I knew I was the normal one.

2853
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:57,060
Any man that said my ex...

2854
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:57,440
I knew I was the...

2855
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,940
Dude, I dated a guy who said all my exes were crazy.

2856
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:00,780
He was the problem.

2857
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:02,640
That's full of cum.

2858
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,100
Are you trying to say I'm the problem?

2859
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:07,800
Wait, wait, wait.

2860
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:09,160
We're not here to cause trouble.

2861
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:10,740
I am.

2862
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:11,840
That guy, me.

2863
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:14,260
Wait.

2864
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,660
That sounds a lot like Winx.

2865
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,700
Queen of the Magic Castle.

2866
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,320
Queen of the Magic Castle.

2867
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:22,840
Queen of the Magic Castle.

2868
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,240
In short, her majesty.

2869
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:26,520
Oh, yes, you mean her majesty.

2870
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,640
Can you take us to her?

2871
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,120
It's kind of urgent.

2872
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:33,260
The queen does not grant audience with peasants.

2873
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:33,840
Peasants?

2874
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:34,940
Peasants?

2875
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:36,120
We made them!

2876
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,840
Okay, I built this castle.

2877
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,060
I even came up with the name Magic Castle.

2878
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,820
So if it wasn't for me, you would be the one.

2879
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:42,480
Oh, what a little bit.

2880
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,640
Excuse my underling, ma'am.

2881
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:46,340
Underling?

2882
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,120
We are messengers from a land far, far away.

2883
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:53,420
We come with a very important letter for her majesty.

2884
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:55,260
Hand it over.

2885
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,820
Oh, well, um, we need to see her majesty in person.

2886
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:01,000
It's a letter in words.

2887
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,880
Hmm, why?

2888
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:04,720
Whoa!

2889
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,100
Because they want to kill the queen.

2890
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:07,780
Whoa!

2891
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,080
What?

2892
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:14,040
This book is a fucking asshole.

2893
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,920
Yeah, snitch.

2894
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,680
You snitch.

2895
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,760
You snitch.

2896
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,880
Yeah, dick rider.

2897
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:38,800
It's a speech letter.

2898
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:41,820
It's a speech letter.

2899
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:42,160
I can't write.

2900
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,200
There is no letter!

2901
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,260
Case closed!

2902
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:46,060
Oh!

2903
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:51,950
Hold on, I received a screenshot.

2904
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:54,270
Is this like off-brand Lego?

2905
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:59,650
Are we too poor to buy real Lego?

2906
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:00,530
Thank you, Ravdude.

2907
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:03,650
I've sent you the screenshot that my moderator sent me.

2908
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:06,310
Not being this great in years.

2909
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:08,630
Oh my god, they gave us a toilet!

2910
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:09,510
Wait, no!

2911
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:11,890
There's different toys that look just like that.

2912
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:12,650
Yeah, I don't remember what.

2913
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:14,850
It wasn't Legos, they were bigger.

2914
01:42:14,990 --> 01:42:15,950
No, it's Playmobil.

2915
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:17,750
Yeah!

2916
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:21,690
Is Playmobil like Lego?

2917
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:23,490
Anyone hear us?

2918
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:25,310
I sent you the screenshot.

2919
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:27,570
I know Lego has like baby Lego.

2920
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:29,010
You're lucky for us.

2921
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:29,910
Duplo.

2922
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:31,010
Oh, Duplo!

2923
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:33,170
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2924
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:35,290
Do you mind?

2925
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:36,070
What are you doing?

2926
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:36,810
I built that.

2927
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:38,010
Yeah, I can see that.

2928
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:40,490
The toilet has no pipes.

2929
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:41,190
Yeah?

2930
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:42,450
It's a toy castle.

2931
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:44,730
Toys don't go to the bathroom.

2932
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:46,710
Yeah.

2933
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:48,450
Toys don't need to eat.

2934
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:49,790
Why did it have a pie?

2935
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:51,930
That's right.

2936
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:53,070
It was a waste of food.

2937
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:54,630
Those toys don't need to eat anyway.

2938
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:56,710
I really shouldn't have skipped those beans.

2939
01:42:57,090 --> 01:42:57,650
Ew.

2940
01:42:58,590 --> 01:42:59,810
It's like paper.

2941
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:01,690
How am I weaker than paper?

2942
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:07,620
Oh no!

2943
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,800
Am I getting...

2944
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:12,500
too flabby?

2945
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:12,700
Ew.

2946
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:18,240
Did you shard yourself or something?

2947
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:19,740
Why are you pulling your pants like that?

2948
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:19,960
What the fuck?

2949
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:21,700
Over here, quick!

2950
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:22,320
Come on!

2951
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,280
I think you sharded.

2952
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:24,260
Stop!

2953
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:27,580
Shard?

2954
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:28,480
Stop!

2955
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:31,300
Why?

2956
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,100
This is a kids game.

2957
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,500
This is a children's game.

2958
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:40,160
This is PGA.

2959
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,700
We are a PG friendly stream.

2960
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:43,740
Hahaha.

2961
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:47,640
Didn't know what shard means.

2962
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:51,980
Oh my god!

2963
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,580
We killed him!

2964
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,460
You killed him!

2965
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:55,380
We killed him!

2966
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:58,180
I get a cool fire sword.

2967
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,220
How the fuck do you get the cool weapons?

2968
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,460
Oh wait, but then you get melee.

2969
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,480
I get FPS.

2970
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:06,720
You know what?

2971
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:07,440
I'm fine with that.

2972
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:08,920
Oh my god!

2973
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:09,680
What the fuck?

2974
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,360
It's like...

2975
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:11,960
I know this type of game.

2976
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:13,320
Okay, wait.

2977
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,560
I'm trying to look at my abilities.

2978
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:15,760
It's like a roguelike.

2979
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:16,360
No, no.

2980
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,680
There's like a specific...

2981
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,180
I know this type... I played this type of game before.

2982
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:23,440
Alright, here you go.

2983
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,180
I got you.

2984
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,280
Wait, can you open these chests or no?

2985
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:27,600
No, we can't.

2986
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,340
Is this DM?

2987
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,880
Is this... No, there's like...

2988
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,460
There's like an old...

2989
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:34,940
Wait, is this you?

2990
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:35,880
You have to go through or me?

2991
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:37,340
Yeah, it's you.

2992
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,860
Oh my god!

2993
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:42,760
There's like an old game that was just like this.

2994
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:43,480
But I don't remember.

2995
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:44,860
It was like an arcade game.

2996
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:47,280
That was just like this.

2997
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:49,080
Alright, give me a sec.

2998
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:49,720
Let me kill this.

2999
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:51,620
Oh.

3000
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:53,500
Nice.

3001
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,720
I have to teleport for you.

3002
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:57,920
Okay, you gotta hurry.

3003
01:44:58,340 --> 01:44:59,180
You gotta hurry!

3004
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,320
I'm getting beat up!

3005
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,000
Okay, I got you.

3006
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:06,400
I got you.

3007
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:07,540
I'm good.

3008
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:09,060
Nice.

3009
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:09,980
Okay, I got hit.

3010
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:12,380
Is it gauntlet?

3011
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:13,900
It might be gauntlet.

3012
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:15,960
Cause I remember it looked just like this.

3013
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,120
Dude, I have a fucking fire tornado moon.

3014
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:20,300
Wait, how do we...

3015
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,220
How do I get over here?

3016
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:23,760
What do you do?

3017
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:24,760
Do you beat this up?

3018
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:28,880
Wait, can I dash through this?

3019
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:30,960
No, I can't.

3020
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:31,940
I'm too fucking...

3021
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:35,820
I can't dash through that.

3022
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,820
Is there some way to open that up for me?

3023
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,120
You stay right there.

3024
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:40,540
Oh!

3025
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,480
I have to go back.

3026
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:43,000
Okay.

3027
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:44,920
I'm too chunky.

3028
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,620
Okay, watch this.

3029
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:48,460
Ice.

3030
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:49,760
Ice.

3031
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,040
Ice.

3032
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:52,940
Ice.

3033
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,820
Don't worry, I got you!

3034
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,140
Don't worry, I got you!

3035
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:58,620
I did it.

3036
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,380
Wait, that's you.

3037
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:02,180
I don't have to do anything now.

3038
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,700
I don't have to do...

3039
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:05,880
Oh, I might be dying!

3040
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,560
Don't die!

3041
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:07,040
Don't die!

3042
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:07,520
Don't die!

3043
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:08,980
Okay, I'm back.

3044
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:09,480
I'm back.

3045
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,140
You can die now.

3046
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:11,420
Don't worry.

3047
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,800
I got you.

3048
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,840
I'll chill here.

3049
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:19,020
Oh, I have to do this.

3050
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:21,860
Woooo!

3051
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,800
I think she's dead?

3052
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:26,860
No, there's still one more.

3053
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,800
Alright, I gotta kill this one guy.

3054
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,040
I believe in you, wife!

3055
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:34,080
Woo!

3056
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:35,860
A fire tornado moon.

3057
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:36,040
Kill him.

3058
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,540
Oh, chest.

3059
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,440
I feel like the chest is useless.

3060
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:44,900
To be fair.

3061
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:46,100
You have to get them.

3062
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,100
Don't worry.

3063
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:49,560
I'm pretty sure your sword can make it over.

3064
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:51,860
There's like range.

3065
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,280
This is you.

3066
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:54,920
This is you.

3067
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:56,380
Yeah, this is you.

3068
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:58,380
This is 100% you.

3069
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,060
Come too far.

3070
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:02,780
Yay!

3071
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:04,940
Woo!

3072
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:07,440
Where am I?

3073
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,880
Wait, where am I?

3074
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,420
Oh, I keep looking at you thinking that's me.

3075
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:14,380
It's okay.

3076
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:16,060
Pew!

3077
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:19,540
Pew!

3078
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:20,640
Oh!

3079
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:24,700
Oh!

3080
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:25,940
I accidentally ulted.

3081
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,100
Okay.

3082
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:28,920
Freeze!

3083
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:32,540
Don't worry.

3084
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:33,800
The hero is here.

3085
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:36,520
Okay.

3086
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:42,940
It's crazy how many different like genres this game has.

3087
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,980
I'm coming over!

3088
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:51,320
I'm helping!

3089
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,040
Pew!

3090
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:53,180
Pew!

3091
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:53,480
Pew!

3092
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:53,740
Pew!

3093
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:53,860
Pew!

3094
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:54,100
Pew!

3095
01:47:58,580 --> 01:47:59,900
Oh, stop.

3096
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,280
I didn't look that strong.

3097
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,040
I'm coming over!

3098
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,720
That's what you get for not believing in my ice powers!

3099
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,120
No, I did.

3100
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:10,480
It's just you took too long.

3101
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:12,760
Are you blaming me?

3102
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,720
The person that has control here?

3103
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:17,180
With the ices?

3104
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:20,880
I made you a bridge.

3105
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,300
I made you a bridge.

3106
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:23,860
And this is the thanks I get?

3107
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:25,920
Okay, fine.

3108
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,080
You could have built one before we got tiny.

3109
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:29,480
Huh?

3110
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:31,180
Pew!

3111
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:31,380
Pew!

3112
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:31,560
Pew!

3113
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:31,620
Okay.

3114
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:32,260
I'm coming over.

3115
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:32,800
Oh, shit!

3116
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:33,360
What?

3117
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:36,220
What the fuck is that?!

3118
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:38,060
Okay.

3119
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:39,920
We gotta go.

3120
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:40,560
We gotta go fast.

3121
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:41,460
We gotta go fast.

3122
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,680
Wait, which way?

3123
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:48,240
It's this way.

3124
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:49,940
I went the wrong way!

3125
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,640
I'm not going anywhere.

3126
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,020
Me,

3127
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:56,540
me, me!

3128
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:57,680
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me!

3129
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:00,800
I got it, I got it, I got it!

3130
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,060
I got it, I got it, I got it!

3131
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:09,720
I got it, I got it!

3132
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:09,720
Okay.

3133
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:11,720
Alright, we're fine.

3134
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,120
We're fine.

3135
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:15,980
See, we're okay.

3136
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,260
Who the fuck gave this fucking...

3137
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:20,020
baby...

3138
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,440
a baby a thing?

3139
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,360
Okay.

3140
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:26,440
I got him!

3141
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:26,840
I got him!

3142
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:27,880
I got him!

3143
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:28,300
Goodbye!

3144
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:29,960
Goodbye!

3145
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:31,480
It's like Toy Story.

3146
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:36,560
Doom!

3147
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:40,520
There's so many references, sis.

3148
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,520
Now it's time to kill the queen.

3149
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:52,160
Bowser?

3150
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:52,880
Bowser?

3151
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,040
The immortal troll?

3152
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:56,900
The what?

3153
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:00,480
The prisoner!

3154
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:02,580
Wait, he's taking zero damage!

3155
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:05,400
Cause we have to do the chains!

3156
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:06,360
We're not going anywhere!

3157
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:08,580
Yes!

3158
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:09,080
That's it!

3159
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,720
We're going to kill the chains!

3160
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,620
Okay, I'm going to the chains!

3161
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:14,260
Oh!

3162
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:16,340
Oh my gosh!

3163
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:17,580
Okay, I'm going to the chains!

3164
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:18,660
I'm going to the chains!

3165
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:19,980
Bait him here!

3166
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:20,560
Bait him here!

3167
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:23,900
Get over here, little man!

3168
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:25,240
Nice.

3169
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:26,680
And then we bait him into the thingy.

3170
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:28,800
We're all toast!

3171
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:29,980
He has to charge it.

3172
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:30,300
Right?

3173
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:31,480
Come on!

3174
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,560
Go into the little hole!

3175
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:34,800
Go!

3176
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:34,920
Go!

3177
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:35,080
Go!

3178
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:35,160
Go!

3179
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:35,580
Get his hands!

3180
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:36,100
Get his hands!

3181
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:36,560
Get his hands!

3182
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:38,140
I'm doing it!

3183
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:40,980
Goodbye, Toy Story!

3184
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:42,480
Yeah!

3185
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,380
What she said!

3186
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,080
Oh!

3187
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:44,680
Oh me!

3188
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:45,260
Come on!

3189
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:45,700
Over here!

3190
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:46,380
Let's go!

3191
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,230
My fire sword is so cool!

3192
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:52,130
Oh!

3193
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:52,530
Oh!

3194
01:50:52,850 --> 01:50:53,250
Doki?

3195
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:53,790
What?

3196
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:54,690
You left!

3197
01:50:55,910 --> 01:50:56,890
My game crashed.

3198
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:58,130
It said EA servers.

3199
01:50:58,510 --> 01:50:58,870
What?

3200
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:00,550
It says the other player left.

3201
01:51:02,190 --> 01:51:02,910
No!

3202
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:03,590
No!

3203
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:04,450
They have to do that again!

3204
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:06,550
The EA servers!

3205
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:07,890
No!

3206
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:10,190
EA!

3207
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:13,970
No!

3208
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:18,170
We have to do dungeon crawler again!

3209
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:22,070
Oh my god!

3210
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:23,910
We just made it!

3211
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:26,290
The curse passed over to you!

3212
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:28,850
Oh, apparently that was a Terminator reference.

3213
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:29,550
Not Doom.

3214
01:51:29,730 --> 01:51:31,250
I saw it on Doom though!

3215
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:37,550
Sorry.

3216
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:38,710
Terminator reference.

3217
01:51:39,050 --> 01:51:39,950
I remember seeing... Oh!

3218
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:40,250
We did!

3219
01:51:40,430 --> 01:51:40,630
We saved!

3220
01:51:41,590 --> 01:51:42,270
It saved!

3221
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:44,130
This is my old chess board.

3222
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:46,730
Hey, do you know how to play chess?

3223
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:48,110
Yeah.

3224
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:49,550
I used to be in a chess club.

3225
01:51:50,090 --> 01:51:51,270
Because I don't have the time.

3226
01:51:51,710 --> 01:51:53,070
Plus it's not a toy.

3227
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:54,870
You know it was my grandmother's.

3228
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:55,270
Oh!

3229
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:58,130
She would appreciate that it's actually being used.

3230
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:01,570
I don't think we're actually playing chess.

3231
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:04,350
Chess board's alive.

3232
01:52:04,670 --> 01:52:05,290
There's no way.

3233
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:06,550
What if we don't know how to play chess?

3234
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:10,090
Yes.

3235
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:11,910
We have to kill the king and the queen.

3236
01:52:13,070 --> 01:52:14,150
Kill the queen first!

3237
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:16,230
The queen knows the most moves!

3238
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:17,350
That's literally who I'm targeting!

3239
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:20,570
We gotta kill... Wait.

3240
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:23,650
If we kill the king, that means the game ends instantly, right?

3241
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:25,470
Because that's how it should work.

3242
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:26,970
Okay.

3243
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:27,850
I'll go for the king.

3244
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:29,490
I see you.

3245
01:52:30,770 --> 01:52:31,950
I'm going for the king.

3246
01:52:32,690 --> 01:52:33,130
Wait.

3247
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:33,950
Is it healing?

3248
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:34,970
No.

3249
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:36,070
I'm actually hurting him.

3250
01:52:36,170 --> 01:52:36,350
Okay.

3251
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:36,770
That's good.

3252
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:37,570
Okay.

3253
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:38,250
I was worried.

3254
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:40,490
Don't worry.

3255
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,170
I've got this!

3256
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:43,350
We're tag team!

3257
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:45,270
Okay.

3258
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:45,490
Wait.

3259
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:46,170
How did you die?

3260
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,230
How did you die though?

3261
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:49,070
It's okay!

3262
01:52:49,290 --> 01:52:51,590
The castle can only go in a cross!

3263
01:52:52,990 --> 01:52:54,270
I'm teaching you chess.

3264
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:56,590
Hehehehe.

3265
01:52:58,870 --> 01:53:00,210
Do you like this little lesson?

3266
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:00,890
Oh, wow.

3267
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:01,210
Okay.

3268
01:53:01,630 --> 01:53:02,190
Wait.

3269
01:53:02,390 --> 01:53:03,590
Actually, do you know how to play chess?

3270
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:03,850
What the fuck?

3271
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:04,010
I'm going over!

3272
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:06,390
Okay.

3273
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:10,350
That explains why the fucking horses and knights aren't going diagonal.

3274
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:11,650
In L-shape.

3275
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:13,210
Horses don't go diagonal.

3276
01:53:13,230 --> 01:53:15,090
They go in an L-shape.

3277
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:16,990
I said in an L-shape!

3278
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:18,890
Hehehehe.

3279
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:21,170
Hehehehe.

3280
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:24,410
That's why I'm here to teach you about chess.

3281
01:53:25,590 --> 01:53:26,150
Hehehehe.

3282
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:27,590
Mansplainer!

3283
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:29,130
Mansplainer!

3284
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:31,970
Oh!

3285
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:32,870
Oh!

3286
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:33,450
Oh!

3287
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:34,730
Okay.

3288
01:53:34,930 --> 01:53:35,410
I don't know.

3289
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:36,410
I didn't get hit once.

3290
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:39,050
Because I know how to play chess.

3291
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:41,310
Why does it have no handles?

3292
01:53:41,310 --> 01:53:43,370
I think it's because the queen gets something and shit.

3293
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:44,030
Oh yeah.

3294
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:44,870
You're right.

3295
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:45,890
Oh!

3296
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:47,130
Oh yeah!

3297
01:53:47,170 --> 01:53:47,590
I remember!

3298
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:49,490
Haha!

3299
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,110
What the fuck?

3300
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:53,710
What the fuck?

3301
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:55,290
Did I make this door?

3302
01:53:55,730 --> 01:53:56,210
Hehehe.

3303
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:56,850
How?

3304
01:53:57,610 --> 01:53:57,950
How?

3305
01:53:58,050 --> 01:53:58,250
Yeah.

3306
01:53:59,510 --> 01:53:59,990
Oh.

3307
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:02,130
That was not how you opened the door.

3308
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:03,610
No!

3309
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:05,370
We lost our wizard powers!

3310
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:07,910
How are we gonna kill the elephant now?

3311
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:08,810
I don't know.

3312
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:10,290
Wait a minute.

3313
01:54:10,950 --> 01:54:11,530
That's right.

3314
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:11,970
I forgot.

3315
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:16,530
I color coded them the opposite way around to fool intruders.

3316
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:17,030
What?

3317
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:21,030
It's actually very smart if you think about it.

3318
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:22,630
Who the fuck's intruders?

3319
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:23,690
Why would you do that?

3320
01:54:23,770 --> 01:54:25,030
Who's gonna intrude the castle?

3321
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:25,590
Haha.

3322
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:27,610
Oh.

3323
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:28,790
Still gonna miss my outfit.

3324
01:54:29,050 --> 01:54:29,690
Oh my god.

3325
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,980
Why do we put electricity there?

3326
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:37,400
Like, for a kid's toy?

3327
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,660
What if my daughter forgot?

3328
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,040
What if my daughter forgot?

3329
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:42,120
Yeah.

3330
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:43,920
She's gonna shock her finger.

3331
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:47,420
Greetings, your majesty.

3332
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:48,060
Greetings, your majesty.

3333
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:48,400
Hello.

3334
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,400
You don't need to bow.

3335
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:52,160
I'm Cutie the elephant.

3336
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,080
Oh my gosh.

3337
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:53,800
She's so cute.

3338
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:55,780
Do you want some cookies?

3339
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:57,720
I actually love cookies.

3340
01:54:57,820 --> 01:54:59,880
Cody, you're not here to stuff your face with cookies.

3341
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,120
Let's just do this.

3342
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,040
You sound unhappy.

3343
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,340
You can tell me what's wrong.

3344
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,200
That's what friends are for.

3345
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:07,980
No, no.

3346
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:08,740
Nothing's wrong.

3347
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,160
It's great.

3348
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,900
Everything's like super great.

3349
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:14,660
Well, I can see you're not happy.

3350
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:16,560
You need a hug.

3351
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:17,700
I kinda do.

3352
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:18,860
Aww.

3353
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:20,860
What are you doing?

3354
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:23,720
Let's kill her.

3355
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:24,800
Woah.

3356
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:26,480
Woah.

3357
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:28,800
No, no, no.

3358
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:30,200
We don't wanna kill you.

3359
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,460
We just kinda have to.

3360
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:32,740
It's a little bit.

3361
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:36,000
But we're cutie the loving elephant.

3362
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,320
Oh my god.

3363
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:37,560
Aww.

3364
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:41,520
What the fuck is wrong with you, Goomy?

3365
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:42,880
I know.

3366
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:44,220
You're the one that said it.

3367
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,340
You were like, we're gonna kill her.

3368
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:48,100
And I was like, woah.

3369
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,520
No, you made this plan.

3370
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:52,460
No, no, no.

3371
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:53,620
This is a group effort.

3372
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,720
When we get married...

3373
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:56,540
You keep saying that.

3374
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:59,800
When we got married, every idea is a group effort.

3375
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,020
There's no I in marriage.

3376
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:04,600
There's no I in marriage.

3377
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:07,820
Why the fuck does she keep turning around to look back at us?

3378
01:56:08,220 --> 01:56:08,700
Why the fuck does she keep turning around to look back at us?

3379
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:09,240
Oh my god.

3380
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:10,160
To the moon!

3381
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Oh my god!

3382
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:12,920
Do you see that?

3383
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:14,020
See that?

3384
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,400
The drawing on the box!

3385
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:17,100
Oh yeah!

3386
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,140
There's Elmo!

3387
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:23,380
Oh my god!

3388
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:23,700
Oh my god!

3389
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:26,620
Oh my god!

3390
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:26,920
Where was she?

3391
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:27,160
Oh!

3392
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:33,140
Guess that's the way the cookie crumbles.

3393
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:35,100
Well that's fucked up, Goomy.

3394
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,380
Oh, it's like the cookie monster!

3395
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:39,660
We don't want to do this, but we have to!

3396
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,060
We have to make Rose cry!

3397
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:43,720
It's nothing personal!

3398
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:45,580
See, you said it!

3399
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:46,640
No, no, no.

3400
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,480
You said it first.

3401
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:48,480
I just went with you.

3402
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:49,260
I just enabled you.

3403
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:49,600
No.

3404
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:52,000
Oh, it's a crane game!

3405
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,260
I'm really good at this!

3406
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:57,140
Man, always changing the narrative.

3407
01:56:57,820 --> 01:56:58,260
Whoa.

3408
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:00,600
No, that's not it.

3409
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:01,280
We have to...

3410
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,060
You have to...

3411
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:04,500
Okay, I'll do the grabby thing.

3412
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:06,060
I'll do the grabby thing.

3413
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:08,460
I made a fucking claw machine for her?

3414
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:10,620
Bro, I'm the perfect dad.

3415
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:12,140
Holy shit.

3416
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,640
Okay, we need to time this better.

3417
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:16,780
Okay, she's got...

3418
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:18,940
She goes in a circle.

3419
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,560
Yeah, she goes in a fucking circle.

3420
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:22,540
Okay, we wait here.

3421
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:22,720
Okay.

3422
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:24,620
One, two, three.

3423
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:25,760
No, no, no, no, no!

3424
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:26,320
Why did you move?

3425
01:57:32,750 --> 01:57:33,150
Perfectly!

3426
01:57:35,110 --> 01:57:35,510
Okay.

3427
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:37,050
You put it over here.

3428
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:37,510
Okay, okay.

3429
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:38,210
And I'll time it.

3430
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:39,410
Watch this.

3431
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:42,570
Maybe we go up here because I'm impatient.

3432
01:57:43,150 --> 01:57:43,750
Watch this.

3433
01:57:44,530 --> 01:57:45,210
Maybe here.

3434
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:45,790
I'm impatient.

3435
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:47,830
Boom!

3436
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:50,710
There you go.

3437
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:51,590
Perfect timing.

3438
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:53,250
Oh my god!

3439
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:57,150
That is so fucked up.

3440
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:58,310
Oh my god.

3441
01:57:59,110 --> 01:58:00,490
How are we gonna kill this thing?

3442
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:02,930
You know how Yusa looks like a cookie monster?

3443
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:03,650
Yeah.

3444
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:06,930
It kinda reminds me of those old YouTube videos.

3445
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:09,110
Oh, like, let me fire my laser.

3446
01:58:09,310 --> 01:58:09,530
Yeah!

3447
01:58:11,070 --> 01:58:13,030
Let me fire my laser.

3448
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:16,750
I don't wanna do this.

3449
01:58:17,410 --> 01:58:19,210
I think her head's gonna pop off.

3450
01:58:19,930 --> 01:58:20,970
I'm pretty sure.

3451
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:23,090
Yeah, this head is definitely gonna pop off.

3452
01:58:23,210 --> 01:58:25,230
I think we're popping off her head.

3453
01:58:26,570 --> 01:58:27,650
I think we're popping off her head.

3454
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:28,790
Oh!

3455
01:58:29,450 --> 01:58:29,750
Oh!

3456
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:39,130
At least it's not the head.

3457
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:41,830
We gotta get her to the edge of the bookshelf.

3458
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:44,650
Edge of the bookshelf?

3459
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:45,430
Come on!

3460
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:46,150
Grab her!

3461
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:47,650
Bro, this is...

3462
01:58:48,650 --> 01:58:50,250
Bro, where's your guard?

3463
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:51,790
Alright, let's go.

3464
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:54,170
It's time to take her to the edge.

3465
01:58:55,070 --> 01:58:56,150
Come on, Gumi.

3466
01:58:56,210 --> 01:58:57,570
We already made it this far.

3467
01:58:59,070 --> 01:59:00,650
We can't back up now!

3468
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:01,710
We made it this far!

3469
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:06,870
We made it this far!

3470
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:07,270
It's alright.

3471
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:09,690
It's alright.

3472
01:59:09,690 --> 01:59:10,030
Oh, god.

3473
01:59:10,190 --> 01:59:11,990
They're begging to not die.

3474
01:59:13,910 --> 01:59:15,130
Oh, my god.

3475
01:59:15,170 --> 01:59:15,810
She's struggling!

3476
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:16,310
Get her!

3477
01:59:17,330 --> 01:59:18,570
She can't get away!

3478
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:20,390
My god.

3479
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:22,670
Who did I marry?

3480
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:24,510
I married a boy of hers.

3481
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:26,970
It's too late!

3482
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:27,970
We're already this far!

3483
01:59:28,410 --> 01:59:30,850
If we let her live, she's gonna tell the cops!

3484
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:35,230
Stop resisting!

3485
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:38,150
Stop resisting!

3486
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:40,100
Pump!

3487
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,720
She doesn't need the ear!

3488
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:42,960
Pump!

3489
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,220
She doesn't need the ear!

3490
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:45,660
She doesn't feel no...

3491
01:59:45,660 --> 01:59:46,800
She doesn't feel pain!

3492
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,020
Don't worry!

3493
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:50,240
She feels zero pain!

3494
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:51,060
She's a dog!

3495
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:51,800
She feels zero pain!

3496
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:51,800
She's a dog!

3497
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:58,000
Down she goes!

3498
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:00,820
Goodbye!

3499
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:01,760
Goodbye!

3500
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:06,420
See?

3501
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:08,280
She was lying about feeling pain!

3502
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:15,630
Gumi, come on.

3503
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:17,670
No, you can button mash faster than this, Gumi.

3504
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:18,350
Come on!

3505
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:21,490
This is a group effort!

3506
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:24,510
We agreed to this when we got married!

3507
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:25,430
I don't want to!

3508
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:27,490
I did agree to committing murder!

3509
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:29,050
Lord, lift the king!

3510
02:00:32,270 --> 02:00:32,830
...

3511
02:00:32,830 --> 02:00:33,530
...

3512
02:00:33,530 --> 02:00:33,990
...

3513
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:34,330
...

3514
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:37,410
We just...

3515
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:38,690
Dude, imagine being a kid!

3516
02:00:38,930 --> 02:00:42,030
Imagine being a kid and seeing your doll ripped up out of nowhere!

3517
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:43,090
I like how we...

3518
02:00:43,090 --> 02:00:47,450
I love how we threw her leg and ears to...

3519
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:57,930
Cry.

3520
02:00:58,630 --> 02:00:59,490
Oh no, cutie.

3521
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:00,490
Poor cutie.

3522
02:01:01,970 --> 02:01:02,870
I'm sorry.

3523
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:05,370
I'm so sorry you hurt yourself.

3524
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:06,690
What?

3525
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:07,970
...

3526
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:10,670
Success.

3527
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:12,290
We made it look like an accident.

3528
02:01:12,370 --> 02:01:12,490
I'm sorry.

3529
02:01:12,490 --> 02:01:13,570
May, I think it's working.

3530
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:14,390
...

3531
02:01:16,710 --> 02:01:18,390
Don't we need her tears, though?

3532
02:01:18,590 --> 02:01:18,970
Yes!

3533
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:20,090
Come on!

3534
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:21,730
Alright, we gotta get down there!

3535
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:22,690
Quick!

3536
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:24,550
Before she stops!

3537
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:25,210
This way!

3538
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:25,730
Come on!

3539
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:26,970
This is so fucked up.

3540
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:29,470
Like, this is the part where it's fucked up.

3541
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:32,010
Imagine parents hogging.

3542
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:33,630
Yeah, like, our kids cried!

3543
02:01:33,850 --> 02:01:34,590
Fuck yeah!

3544
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:36,730
Woohoo!

3545
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:39,650
Time to dance in the rain!

3546
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:40,550
Let's go!

3547
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:41,390
Dance!

3548
02:01:41,850 --> 02:01:42,330
Sweets!

3549
02:01:42,490 --> 02:01:43,570
Sweet tears!

3550
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:44,810
Woo!

3551
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:47,510
Yeah!

3552
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:49,190
Shower time!

3553
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:52,530
...

3554
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:52,610
...

3555
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:56,750
...

3556
02:01:57,450 --> 02:01:58,350
...

3557
02:01:58,350 --> 02:01:59,010
...

3558
02:01:59,010 --> 02:01:59,770
...

3559
02:01:59,770 --> 02:01:59,970
...

3560
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:55,240
God, you read so fucking slow!

3561
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:04,460
Maybe we just never have kids, though.

3562
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:10,620
What?!

3563
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:12,620
That did not look like four pieces, man.

3564
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:14,980
Yeah, that's a big ass letter.

3565
02:03:24,860 --> 02:03:25,280
What?!

3566
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,920
Bro, fuck this book!

3567
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:30,820
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that we could...

3568
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:31,200
Do we make a fucking kid cry?

3569
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:33,740
Yeah, we're gonna ignore the fact that she's crying?

3570
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:40,480
Yeah, we're... oh yeah, you're right, we don't need the top two.

3571
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:41,640
We already read the top two.

3572
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:42,980
Oh, we're in therapy.

3573
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:45,360
I told you we needed couples counseling.

3574
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:55,000
You refer to us instead of me.

3575
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:56,620
You're a team now.

3576
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:59,400
I know we're not a team and we don't have time for this.

3577
02:03:59,940 --> 02:04:00,520
Time?

3578
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:02,160
Good man.

3579
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:04,360
That will be our first topic.

3580
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:05,540
Aha!

3581
02:04:06,220 --> 02:04:10,500
Now, do you give each other enough time?

3582
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:12,740
See, that's crazy, but...

3583
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:15,260
We actually... we don't.

3584
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,980
Yeah, we don't.

3585
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:18,280
She is never at home.

3586
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:22,120
Yeah, you love your job more than you love me.

3587
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:23,880
I'm working for both of us.

3588
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:24,940
I'm working too.

3589
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:25,900
You don't even make money.

3590
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:27,360
But I make sacrifices.

3591
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:32,920
It is!

3592
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:33,740
It's...

3593
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:34,980
It is!

3594
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:35,480
No, it's not!

3595
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:36,320
No, it's not!

3596
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:37,880
No, it's not!

3597
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:37,920
No, it's not!

3598
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:48,560
Look, we made progress.

3599
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:53,620
Look at that!

3600
02:04:53,780 --> 02:04:54,620
We made progress!

3601
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:57,240
I think that couples therapy is working.

3602
02:04:57,640 --> 02:04:59,320
I don't want to go to therapy anymore.

3603
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:00,400
I think it's over.

3604
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:00,860
I've checked out.

3605
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:01,520
I can't believe you're right.

3606
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:05,320
My chat was like, I sacrificed my bowel pass for you.

3607
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:07,420
Like, that's how deep my love is.

3608
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:08,480
That I paid for!

3609
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:09,780
That I paid for!

3610
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:11,720
That we share a bank account.

3611
02:05:11,860 --> 02:05:12,680
It's our money.

3612
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,800
Because I'm the only one working.

3613
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:17,640
Wow!

3614
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:19,720
And got it!

3615
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:25,200
With no sense of time, you will now be able to control that!

3616
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:25,520
I do!

3617
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:26,460
I got the power!

3618
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:29,000
I got the power!

3619
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:29,520
I got the power!

3620
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:30,700
Whoa!

3621
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:31,440
Whoa!

3622
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:33,320
Oh, you have the clone.

3623
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:34,040
I have time.

3624
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,780
What's this?

3625
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:39,160
Is that me?

3626
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:41,400
God.

3627
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,620
Why am I so old?

3628
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:45,740
Where's your hairline?

3629
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:48,500
Look at that.

3630
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,060
Look how far your hairline goes.

3631
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:53,020
It's a style.

3632
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:54,400
It's a choice.

3633
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:56,600
God, you sound like...

3634
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:00,400
Because I...

3635
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:02,580
That's me.

3636
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:03,580
Because you might as well be.

3637
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:08,640
Okay, then he used the bathtub for a prank.

3638
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:10,180
Don't be weird to my chat.

3639
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:11,720
I don't need to follow those wooden dolls.

3640
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:14,180
The book says we have to make the two meet.

3641
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:15,100
So what?

3642
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:16,280
Let's just do it.

3643
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,740
We need Rose's letter to break the spell.

3644
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:21,580
Chat, I'm going to tell you guys a story.

3645
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:25,220
Oh, what story should I tell?

3646
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:29,820
What?

3647
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:32,320
What story have I not talked about in a while?

3648
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:36,160
That Doki chat probably hasn't heard.

3649
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:37,940
Maybe the OGs.

3650
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:45,480
I don't know.

3651
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:46,240
What do I have?

3652
02:06:55,090 --> 02:06:57,190
I didn't know they made a plush of it.

3653
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:00,150
I think...

3654
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:02,430
When I was younger...

3655
02:07:03,530 --> 02:07:04,710
I had a nightmare.

3656
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:07,190
This is completely unrelated.

3657
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:10,730
I just thought about the paste-eating kid from Powerpuff Girls.

3658
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:16,950
But when I was younger, I used to have a lot of nightmares about this one specific episode that had a mime in it.

3659
02:07:17,470 --> 02:07:18,530
And like...

3660
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:21,030
I think...

3661
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:22,510
No!

3662
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:23,390
Actually, no!

3663
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:24,490
This reminded me!

3664
02:07:24,530 --> 02:07:25,990
I actually have a good story.

3665
02:07:26,730 --> 02:07:28,470
So when I was in third grade...

3666
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:30,330
Second, third grade...

3667
02:07:30,330 --> 02:07:31,610
I kept having nightmares.

3668
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:33,790
They were recurring nightmares...

3669
02:07:33,790 --> 02:07:35,670
Of my mom driving...

3670
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:38,590
And abandoning me...

3671
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:40,790
At a trailer park with the Kanker sisters.

3672
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:42,610
From Ed, Edd, and Eddy.

3673
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:46,310
And it would be different each time.

3674
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:48,330
Like the first time I had it, she just abandoned me there.

3675
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:49,590
The second time...

3676
02:07:49,590 --> 02:07:51,550
They abandoned me there, but my like...

3677
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:54,370
Step-sister removed was in the car.

3678
02:07:56,370 --> 02:07:58,170
And then in the third one...

3679
02:07:58,170 --> 02:07:59,150
She abandoned me there.

3680
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:01,010
But they...

3681
02:08:01,010 --> 02:08:02,250
They started shooting...

3682
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:04,010
Fucking ARs.

3683
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:08,630
They had ARs and everything and I had to take cover behind a couch.

3684
02:08:08,870 --> 02:08:10,970
I was like hiding behind a couch like this.

3685
02:08:11,310 --> 02:08:12,330
So scared.

3686
02:08:13,350 --> 02:08:15,570
And like you can see the bullet holes through the couch.

3687
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:16,290
Anyways...

3688
02:08:17,130 --> 02:08:18,970
My teacher gave us an assignment.

3689
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:21,850
That was like...

3690
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:25,390
Write down...

3691
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:28,030
Your dreams...

3692
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:29,310
Of late...

3693
02:08:29,310 --> 02:08:29,930
Like...

3694
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:31,650
Your dreams of lately.

3695
02:08:32,150 --> 02:08:35,410
And I wrote that down and then they pulled me aside like...

3696
02:08:35,410 --> 02:08:36,410
Is everything okay, Crystal?

3697
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:37,310
I'm like yeah.

3698
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:38,390
I mean...

3699
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:41,210
I don't know when I'm gonna have that dream again, but it's okay.

3700
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:43,350
Anyways...

3701
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:47,050
What the fuck kind of dream was that?

3702
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:49,670
What the fuck?

3703
02:08:50,310 --> 02:08:51,730
It was an occurring dream.

3704
02:08:52,390 --> 02:08:53,970
A recurring dream?

3705
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:54,550
What?

3706
02:08:54,630 --> 02:08:55,610
Are you okay?

3707
02:08:56,350 --> 02:08:57,670
I don't know.

3708
02:08:57,690 --> 02:08:58,990
That's second grade me, man.

3709
02:08:59,070 --> 02:09:00,050
That was second grade, dog.

3710
02:09:00,050 --> 02:09:00,970
That's second grade?

3711
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:03,250
So I saw the...

3712
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:04,410
I saw the Goomy Teen.

3713
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:07,270
Guys, this is what the Goomy Teen looks like.

3714
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:08,050
So...

3715
02:09:08,730 --> 02:09:09,290
The...

3716
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:11,130
It's basically a skin.

3717
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:12,550
It's a Fortnite skin.

3718
02:09:12,730 --> 02:09:15,650
You put a fucking DLC skin on top of a guillotine.

3719
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:16,730
That's...

3720
02:09:17,710 --> 02:09:18,270
Okay.

3721
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:22,350
Don't you see those people who trademark their own special knives and shit?

3722
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:22,910
No.

3723
02:09:22,910 --> 02:09:24,070
It's still...

3724
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:24,310
What?

3725
02:09:24,770 --> 02:09:25,910
It's still a knife.

3726
02:09:26,150 --> 02:09:27,650
And then they name it something else?

3727
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:29,230
It's still a knife.

3728
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:30,150
What do you mean?

3729
02:09:30,510 --> 02:09:32,090
Yeah, but they name it something else.

3730
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:33,410
Okay, I fixed it.

3731
02:09:34,110 --> 02:09:34,910
There you go.

3732
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:36,070
I fixed it.

3733
02:09:38,790 --> 02:09:40,490
It's your turn to fix this.

3734
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:42,490
Wait, what's...

3735
02:09:42,490 --> 02:09:43,030
What happened?

3736
02:09:43,770 --> 02:09:44,910
Oh, did you not make it through?

3737
02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:47,110
You have to time it.

3738
02:09:47,470 --> 02:09:48,470
Oh, I thought I...

3739
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:49,690
I thought you made it through.

3740
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:50,450
I made it through.

3741
02:09:51,890 --> 02:09:52,550
There you go.

3742
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:55,450
I got the cool powers.

3743
02:09:55,670 --> 02:09:56,530
Wait, what's your power?

3744
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:58,910
I can make clones of myself.

3745
02:09:59,070 --> 02:10:00,650
Oh, I think you can make a clone of yourself here.

3746
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:02,050
Oh, wait.

3747
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:04,290
You have to make clones to do the lever.

3748
02:10:06,470 --> 02:10:07,070
No, no, no.

3749
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:08,990
I go back in time.

3750
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:10,150
What?

3751
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:11,010
Wait, what?

3752
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:16,190
Hey, maybe you can reach the door before it closes with your clone.

3753
02:10:16,230 --> 02:10:16,870
Yeah, see?

3754
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:21,370
Oh, I thought you meant you want me to leave it to the lever.

3755
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:22,150
No, no.

3756
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:25,150
I want you to have your clone to go over there.

3757
02:10:26,930 --> 02:10:27,350
Bing.

3758
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:29,050
Yay!

3759
02:10:30,950 --> 02:10:31,530
What's this?

3760
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:35,150
Oh!

3761
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:35,870
No, I have...

3762
02:10:35,870 --> 02:10:37,290
Yeah, yeah, hook onto this.

3763
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:37,550
Hook...

3764
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:37,870
Wait.

3765
02:10:39,490 --> 02:10:39,910
What?

3766
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:44,150
Where are you bringing it?

3767
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:45,350
Oh, no.

3768
02:10:45,450 --> 02:10:45,990
Oh, here, here, here.

3769
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:48,730
And then...

3770
02:10:48,730 --> 02:10:50,530
I make it go up here?

3771
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:51,350
Oh, no.

3772
02:10:51,870 --> 02:10:52,510
Oh, my God.

3773
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:53,070
We're so smart.

3774
02:10:56,990 --> 02:10:58,250
We're so fucking smart.

3775
02:10:59,050 --> 02:11:04,490
Who designed this?

3776
02:11:04,630 --> 02:11:05,390
Oh, shit!

3777
02:11:05,850 --> 02:11:07,270
Wait, do I respawn next to you?

3778
02:11:08,010 --> 02:11:08,850
Oh, no, I don't.

3779
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:12,090
I should be able to make it.

3780
02:11:12,150 --> 02:11:12,890
Make this jump.

3781
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:13,570
Yay!

3782
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:16,050
You have to do the time thingy over there.

3783
02:11:16,290 --> 02:11:16,650
Where?

3784
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:17,150
Oh, here.

3785
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:19,130
I'm rewinding.

3786
02:11:20,030 --> 02:11:20,830
Right here it is.

3787
02:11:20,970 --> 02:11:21,330
Oh, shit.

3788
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:21,570
Jump.

3789
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:23,650
Not that thingy.

3790
02:11:23,830 --> 02:11:24,550
No, it's this.

3791
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:27,030
That's the only thing I can rewind.

3792
02:11:27,990 --> 02:11:28,910
No, look over there.

3793
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:29,490
Oh.

3794
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:31,410
Wait, what?

3795
02:11:31,490 --> 02:11:31,610
Oh!

3796
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:35,170
I did it.

3797
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:37,650
Wait, but where would you go?

3798
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:41,070
Oh.

3799
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:41,990
Yeah, that's the thing.

3800
02:11:42,030 --> 02:11:42,610
Where do you go?

3801
02:11:43,650 --> 02:11:44,930
There's a button up there.

3802
02:11:46,330 --> 02:11:46,970
Must be...

3803
02:11:46,970 --> 02:11:47,970
I think you jump over there.

3804
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:50,250
Yeah.

3805
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:50,790
I think I did it.

3806
02:11:50,790 --> 02:11:50,810
I did it.

3807
02:11:52,530 --> 02:11:53,110
Wait, what?

3808
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:55,290
And then what?

3809
02:11:55,290 --> 02:11:55,930
And then you leave your clothes?

3810
02:11:56,030 --> 02:11:56,250
Hold on.

3811
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:56,510
Hold on.

3812
02:11:58,830 --> 02:11:59,930
Yeah, let it fall.

3813
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:04,680
Oh!

3814
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:07,660
We did it!

3815
02:12:08,860 --> 02:12:10,220
And then I'll let it go up?

3816
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:11,740
Uh huh.

3817
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:12,780
Yeah.

3818
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:15,620
And then you press the button!

3819
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:16,900
Team!

3820
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,020
I like how you said we did it, but I figured it out.

3821
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:22,700
Yeah, but you need me to be able to do it.

3822
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:23,400
We're able to do it!

3823
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,760
There's no I in team!

3824
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:34,120
There's no I in marriage too!

3825
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:39,860
There we go.

3826
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:40,920
Fixed it.

3827
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:43,740
What do we do with this?

3828
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:44,420
Why did you fix it?

3829
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:45,860
Nothing.

3830
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:47,520
Oh, but it looks so beautiful.

3831
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:50,780
We needed this thing.

3832
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:52,220
Oh, this.

3833
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:54,900
Not this.

3834
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:58,500
I can't... what?

3835
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,260
There's only one I can pull.

3836
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:02,200
I can't pull the other thing.

3837
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:05,440
That's why I think I have to do this.

3838
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:07,400
Yeah, see?

3839
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,160
I told you!

3840
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:10,820
That's what it fixes!

3841
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:11,760
Oh, the owl waited now!

3842
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,380
Yeah, and then... whoop!

3843
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:16,180
We get launched over and then I send you back up.

3844
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:20,760
And then you leave your clone and then I go away.

3845
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:22,000
And then you clone.

3846
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:23,540
And then I go...

3847
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:25,180
And then you go up.

3848
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:26,640
See?

3849
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:28,500
I feel like a little rat.

3850
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:30,820
Rat, rat.

3851
02:13:31,140 --> 02:13:32,480
We are the rats.

3852
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:34,440
There we go!

3853
02:13:37,580 --> 02:13:39,220
And then we just go here.

3854
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:43,900
Yay!

3855
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:46,080
Oh!

3856
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,000
I accidentally pressed A.

3857
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:49,760
It's an accident.

3858
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:51,620
What?

3859
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:52,900
Hahaha!

3860
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:55,440
What?

3861
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:56,400
I agreed with you.

3862
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:57,500
I said, sure!

3863
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:00,060
God!

3864
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:01,240
Qua?

3865
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:02,180
Gaslighting.

3866
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:02,840
Pretty usual.

3867
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:04,300
I'm gaslighting?

3868
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:05,080
I said sch...

3869
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:06,360
I agreed with you.

3870
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:07,520
I...

3871
02:14:09,120 --> 02:14:10,160
Why are you pressing?

3872
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:13,820
Oh, they're like cuckoo clocks.

3873
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:15,640
We have to leave.

3874
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:16,560
Do you have to leave your clone?

3875
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:18,480
Wait, you have to leave your clone on one of them, maybe?

3876
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:20,040
Yeah.

3877
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:20,260
Yeah.

3878
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:22,760
Yeah, cause like...

3879
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:25,400
Yeah, then you go back.

3880
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,260
There you go.

3881
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:31,260
Rewind that shit.

3882
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:32,380
I'm rewinding?

3883
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:34,960
Yeah, rewinding.

3884
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:35,620
Don't you have to...

3885
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:38,120
Oh, can you not rewind and stand on it?

3886
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,640
No, I think you have to stand...

3887
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:39,740
No.

3888
02:14:49,860 --> 02:14:51,000
What the hell?

3889
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:51,440
Whoa!

3890
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:52,720
This is like...

3891
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:53,620
Seampunk.

3892
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:54,240
Is.

3893
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:55,220
This.

3894
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:56,040
Who built this?

3895
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:56,780
I did.

3896
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:59,020
Because no one else is gonna take credit.

3897
02:14:59,080 --> 02:14:59,920
I'll take credit for it.

3898
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:02,760
You didn't even let me have a chance.

3899
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,380
You just said it in a split second.

3900
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:05,140
I'll be honest.

3901
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:09,000
If you really wanted to take credit for it, you'd be faster.

3902
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:13,540
I didn't want to take credit for something that I didn't do.

3903
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,100
Yeah, cause I did it.

3904
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:18,880
Did that book say anything about what we do if we lose the track of those guys?

3905
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:21,660
No, he was just blabbing on and on about time.

3906
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:23,320
Oh yeah.

3907
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:25,360
I built it, smile.

3908
02:15:29,620 --> 02:15:30,220
Yeah.

3909
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:35,120
Why are you not home?

3910
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:35,580
Huh?

3911
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,120
Is it cause of Jerry at work?

3912
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,760
Who the fuck is Jerry?

3913
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,600
What does he have that I don't?

3914
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:46,860
A job.

3915
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:52,280
Being a house husband is a job.

3916
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:54,940
How fucking dare you?

3917
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:56,820
I changed her diapers.

3918
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:01,280
I also changed her diapers.

3919
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:01,620
No you didn't.

3920
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:02,140
I come home, you're asleep on the couch.

3921
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:02,400
No you didn't.

3922
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:03,960
You went to do engineer stuff.

3923
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:04,860
I'm a...

3924
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,280
I go to work.

3925
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:07,300
I'm working hard.

3926
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:13,460
I come home, you're sleeping on the couch and she's doing her homework alone in the room and I still have dishes to do.

3927
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:15,760
No, I cleaned the dishes.

3928
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:16,520
Why do you leave the dishes?

3929
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:17,420
I did.

3930
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:19,380
I totally cleaned the dishes.

3931
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:22,260
It's not my fault that you use all the dishes.

3932
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:22,480
I did.

3933
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:25,920
Like do you really need to use...

3934
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:27,240
Why don't we have paper plates?

3935
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:30,760
Sorry.

3936
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:35,240
You have to leave her clone I think, right?

3937
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:38,580
There.

3938
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:40,160
Yeah.

3939
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:46,040
What?

3940
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:47,400
Why didn't you press it?

3941
02:16:47,780 --> 02:16:48,480
No I did.

3942
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:49,040
We have to wait.

3943
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:50,320
Gotta keep following those dolls.

3944
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:52,760
Look at these clock people.

3945
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:55,140
Wait, what is over here?

3946
02:16:56,860 --> 02:16:58,260
What the fuck is over here?

3947
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,660
Where is this other area?

3948
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:03,680
This area is fucking...

3949
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:04,420
Oh I found it!

3950
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:05,540
I already found the other bell.

3951
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:10,000
I think that was just a regular bell.

3952
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:13,920
I found the regular bell.

3953
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:15,760
This is actually beautiful.

3954
02:17:22,460 --> 02:17:23,100
Yay!

3955
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:26,500
Game!

3956
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:27,860
Game?

3957
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:28,460
Where is that?

3958
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:30,260
Mom?

3959
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:32,160
I'm trying to find you right now.

3960
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:33,620
Jesus Christ.

3961
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:36,200
This is a huge area.

3962
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:37,720
The hell tower?

3963
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:38,740
Holy fuck.

3964
02:17:39,060 --> 02:17:40,680
We taught our kid the word hell?

3965
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:42,740
What the fuck?

3966
02:17:42,940 --> 02:17:44,160
How do we play this?

3967
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:47,520
Follow the bubbles and reach the finish line.

3968
02:17:48,560 --> 02:17:49,200
What?

3969
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:49,940
What?

3970
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:50,300
What?

3971
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:52,060
I thought this was just a bubble.

3972
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:55,460
Oh it's like spiral where we have to follow the thing.

3973
02:17:55,820 --> 02:17:55,840
Oh man.

3974
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:58,380
Run and you won't explode me.

3975
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:00,480
Okay.

3976
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:01,940
Check.

3977
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:03,700
Stay on track Cody.

3978
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:04,500
Come on.

3979
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:05,600
This is not fair.

3980
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:07,380
Why are you faster?

3981
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:09,460
I will not explode.

3982
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:10,880
This is not fair.

3983
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:12,480
This is not fair.

3984
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:13,520
What are you doing to me?

3985
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:14,840
We got the same speed!

3986
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:15,300
You got a head start.

3987
02:18:15,300 --> 02:18:16,440
No you have the head start.

3988
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:17,680
You're faster than me.

3989
02:18:18,140 --> 02:18:19,560
There's no other reason.

3990
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:20,280
I will not explode.

3991
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:23,500
There's no other reason.

3992
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,260
There's no other reason.

3993
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:29,820
Oh god.

3994
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:34,260
I'm coming over!

3995
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:34,940
I'm coming over!

3996
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:35,480
I'm coming over!

3997
02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:39,960
Where does it go?

3998
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:42,500
Nice.

3999
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:44,600
Oh, this way, this way, this way.

4000
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:47,220
This way, this way, this way.

4001
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:48,820
I did it!

4002
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:49,320
Yes!

4003
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:51,320
Whoa!

4004
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:53,560
Yeah!

4005
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,360
Not a cope anymore!

4006
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:57,520
Cause I won.

4007
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:04,900
Oh, the artichoke.

4008
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:07,640
Oh god, I think I need to eat another tub.

4009
02:19:07,740 --> 02:19:08,640
Not a cope.

4010
02:19:08,660 --> 02:19:09,660
Wait, there's another game over here!

4011
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:10,540
There's another game over here!

4012
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:11,120
Follow me!

4013
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:13,020
Hey.

4014
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:13,600
Yeah!

4015
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:16,380
Yeah!

4016
02:19:16,380 --> 02:19:16,520
Yay!

4017
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:17,920
Wait, where are you, Gumi?

4018
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:19,580
There's a game right over here!

4019
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:22,440
The chickens!

4020
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:24,560
What is this?

4021
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:25,400
Oh, it's a shooter!

4022
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:26,600
Did you call the sheep chicken?

4023
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:29,280
No, there's a chicken next to the horse!

4024
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:31,620
There you go.

4025
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:33,600
Get on the horse.

4026
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:35,880
I'm ready.

4027
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:38,660
Oh god.

4028
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,300
Okay.

4029
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:40,800
Crouch.

4030
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:43,940
Avoid obstacles to reach the finish line.

4031
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:45,160
Crouch and jump.

4032
02:19:45,820 --> 02:19:46,300
Alright.

4033
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:47,680
Not against my winning horse.

4034
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:48,840
How do I crouch?

4035
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:50,780
Like, is it pressing?

4036
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:51,460
It said it.

4037
02:19:52,380 --> 02:19:53,900
Oh, it's like this!

4038
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:56,420
Wee-oh!

4039
02:19:57,700 --> 02:19:58,180
Yay!

4040
02:19:58,860 --> 02:19:59,340
Wave!

4041
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:00,520
Yay!

4042
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,100
Oh my god, look how beautiful my horse is.

4043
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:06,680
Wee!

4044
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:08,620
Did I be honest?

4045
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:10,200
Yeah.

4046
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:11,860
I like the horses that look like they're wearing socks.

4047
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:12,860
You know what I mean?

4048
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,040
Oh, I know what you mean.

4049
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:14,240
Yeah.

4050
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:15,940
They're really fancy.

4051
02:20:16,100 --> 02:20:16,300
No!

4052
02:20:16,980 --> 02:20:17,640
No!

4053
02:20:17,740 --> 02:20:18,800
It's not fair!

4054
02:20:19,060 --> 02:20:19,540
No!

4055
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:21,180
Best race ever!

4056
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:23,840
What do you mean it's not fair?

4057
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:26,860
When I don't win, it's not fair.

4058
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:29,120
Because

4059
02:20:34,330 --> 02:20:35,050
of your horse!

4060
02:20:35,170 --> 02:20:36,790
Your horse, Comet!

4061
02:20:37,210 --> 02:20:38,590
Sounds intriguing.

4062
02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:44,250
Your horse, Comet, distracted me!

4063
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:48,610
How are you missing?

4064
02:20:49,450 --> 02:20:49,690
I don't know.

4065
02:20:49,830 --> 02:20:50,690
I'm stupid.

4066
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:53,810
Whoa!

4067
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:00,840
Is this part of the game?

4068
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:02,020
Is this...

4069
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:05,420
What the... It kind of reminds me of Bayonetta.

4070
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:08,160
Ooh, it reminds me of that cheap game.

4071
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:09,000
You know that one?

4072
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:09,720
Catherine?

4073
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:12,400
Oh my god!

4074
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:14,380
I've always wanted to play Catherine.

4075
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:15,920
I can play Catherine!

4076
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:21,080
I wonder if Catherine will be a good game this stream.

4077
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,100
I've always wanted to play that game.

4078
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:30,460
It's always been like super interesting.

4079
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:34,680
Whoa... No!

4080
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:35,760
Damn it!

4081
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:37,400
I fell on Hell Tower!

4082
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:40,300
Can you do this for... wait, do I have to be there?

4083
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:47,490
Can you just... can you just...

4084
02:21:47,490 --> 02:21:47,910
Oh, I fell!

4085
02:21:48,070 --> 02:21:48,690
Oh, okay.

4086
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:50,870
I thought you could do it for me.

4087
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:52,590
I fell too.

4088
02:21:52,850 --> 02:21:54,570
Oh my god, this is truly is hell.

4089
02:21:54,650 --> 02:21:55,790
Is this even worth it?

4090
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:57,190
I don't think this is part of the game.

4091
02:21:59,470 --> 02:22:01,510
I feel like this is not mandatory.

4092
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:05,450
There's no way that this is mandatory.

4093
02:22:08,730 --> 02:22:11,290
Dude, why is it so hard up there?

4094
02:22:13,150 --> 02:22:14,370
Oh my god!

4095
02:22:14,530 --> 02:22:15,770
Are we just bad?

4096
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:20,450
Are we just bad at video games?

4097
02:22:20,970 --> 02:22:22,030
There's no way.

4098
02:22:22,070 --> 02:22:22,930
I thought we were gamers.

4099
02:22:22,990 --> 02:22:23,490
What happened?

4100
02:22:24,210 --> 02:22:27,070
Well, I'm at the wall jump part.

4101
02:22:28,010 --> 02:22:29,350
Okay, I can just...

4102
02:22:30,810 --> 02:22:32,190
Okay, I'm scared.

4103
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:36,470
How do we wall jump here?

4104
02:22:39,670 --> 02:22:40,630
Oh god.

4105
02:22:40,870 --> 02:22:41,890
No, that was scary.

4106
02:22:46,010 --> 02:22:46,650
No!

4107
02:22:46,650 --> 02:22:47,290
No!

4108
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:53,410
Do we have to...

4109
02:22:56,220 --> 02:22:57,300
Oh my god.

4110
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:01,160
I hate how this moves.

4111
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:03,680
No!

4112
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:09,000
You distracted me!

4113
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:13,380
I can't believe it.

4114
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:14,500
You distracted me.

4115
02:23:15,460 --> 02:23:16,880
I did do nothing.

4116
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:18,360
You distracted me.

4117
02:23:18,580 --> 02:23:20,720
I can't believe you would do this to me.

4118
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:22,200
I can't... I give up.

4119
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:22,480
I'm...

4120
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:23,740
This is not part of the game.

4121
02:23:23,900 --> 02:23:24,800
This is not...

4122
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,040
It is part of the game!

4123
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:26,600
No, it's not!

4124
02:23:26,660 --> 02:23:27,780
There's no way!

4125
02:23:27,980 --> 02:23:29,700
This is not part of the story!

4126
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:31,940
I'm gonna fish.

4127
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:32,940
There's a fishing.

4128
02:23:33,380 --> 02:23:34,260
Let's just fish.

4129
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:34,800
I don't...

4130
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:40,140
I'm gonna fish and you go do your fucking thing.

4131
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:42,480
I gotta catch!

4132
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:48,140
Wait, what the fuck?

4133
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,160
Why couldn't I catch it?

4134
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:54,580
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

4135
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:55,680
Come on.

4136
02:23:56,420 --> 02:23:59,400
Husband's gotta bring in a juicy fish.

4137
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:01,720
Don't worry.

4138
02:24:01,860 --> 02:24:03,380
I'm gonna feed the family.

4139
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:04,540
Come on, come on.

4140
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:08,880
The most exciting gameplay is right here!

4141
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:13,360
Oh!

4142
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:15,200
I got a catch!

4143
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:16,600
Are you happy?

4144
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:16,880
Look!

4145
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:19,400
I got us some food.

4146
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:24,900
I got us some food.

4147
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:25,620
Oh my god!

4148
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:27,320
Look!

4149
02:24:27,560 --> 02:24:28,380
I got more food!

4150
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,440
I told you it didn't matter!

4151
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:31,560
It was just fireworks!

4152
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:34,820
I got us fish though.

4153
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:40,200
Wow, look at that.

4154
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:44,420
I can't even see the fireworks.

4155
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:47,500
I can't even see it from here.

4156
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:49,540
You have to...

4157
02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:50,800
Oh, there you are.

4158
02:24:50,840 --> 02:24:51,440
I see it now.

4159
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:54,300
So beautiful.

4160
02:24:55,900 --> 02:24:57,780
I am the real gamer.

4161
02:24:58,320 --> 02:24:59,180
It's okay.

4162
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:00,400
I caught us some fish.

4163
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:02,260
Like a good husband.

4164
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:07,020
I provided food on the table.

4165
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:13,020
The Hell Tower does not provide food.

4166
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:14,100
That's all I'm saying.

4167
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:16,780
It provides joy.

4168
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:18,400
Something that you didn't bring.

4169
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:19,580
To the table.

4170
02:25:21,820 --> 02:25:22,480
Wow!

4171
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:24,040
I'm the fun dad!

4172
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:24,280
I'm the fun dad!

4173
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:25,420
I built the castle!

4174
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:27,460
Oh, so we need to move the clouds.

4175
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:30,680
You have to move the clouds somehow.

4176
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:34,240
How do we move the clouds?

4177
02:25:37,180 --> 02:25:39,380
It must be something you have to do because...

4178
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:44,520
Because like I just rewind time and then the rain falls down.

4179
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:46,720
Why are you guys freaking out?

4180
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,160
It's not like it's your house, right?

4181
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:52,740
This guy is dancing.

4182
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:54,680
Look at him go.

4183
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:55,260
He's dancing.

4184
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:56,720
He doesn't care.

4185
02:25:57,300 --> 02:25:58,340
He's dancing.

4186
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:02,060
Where is it?

4187
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:03,340
I don't know.

4188
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:07,100
I have no idea where it could be.

4189
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:09,940
How do you move it?

4190
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:10,940
No, that's not it.

4191
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:15,940
Don't worry.

4192
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:16,480
I got this.

4193
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:17,500
My magic power.

4194
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:18,900
Dad power.

4195
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:19,380
Yay!

4196
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:19,660
Yay!

4197
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:22,760
Rain!

4198
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:25,200
We need that.

4199
02:26:25,320 --> 02:26:25,460
Yeah.

4200
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:27,140
And then...

4201
02:26:27,140 --> 02:26:28,100
There you go.

4202
02:26:28,220 --> 02:26:29,080
They're happy now.

4203
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:30,360
I don't think that person is dancing.

4204
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:31,800
I think they were asking for help.

4205
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:32,380
No, no.

4206
02:26:32,440 --> 02:26:32,820
Look at him.

4207
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:33,800
Look at him dance.

4208
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:36,120
He's dancing.

4209
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,260
He's having a great time.

4210
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:43,220
Whee!

4211
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:44,400
Just like me.

4212
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:48,280
I'll grab this one.

4213
02:26:49,620 --> 02:26:50,700
Oh, he's fishing too.

4214
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:51,820
Look at him go.

4215
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:52,920
Can I fish with him?

4216
02:26:54,140 --> 02:26:55,180
Oh, there's a timer here.

4217
02:26:55,320 --> 02:26:55,740
Oh, shit.

4218
02:26:55,860 --> 02:26:56,540
That's dangerous.

4219
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:01,020
Okay, I have to do this.

4220
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:02,320
Oh, we have to...

4221
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:02,800
We have to...

4222
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:03,580
Go back.

4223
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:04,380
Okay, okay.

4224
02:27:04,420 --> 02:27:05,300
We have to do this again.

4225
02:27:05,860 --> 02:27:07,160
And then I have to...

4226
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:08,520
Snag it.

4227
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:11,740
I fucking... I fucked up.

4228
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:11,940
Wait.

4229
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:13,620
I fucked up.

4230
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:14,900
Hey, come back.

4231
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:15,660
Come back.

4232
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:18,300
Okay.

4233
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:20,900
I messed up a little.

4234
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:22,600
Just a little.

4235
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:25,000
Just a little.

4236
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:25,520
What the fuck?

4237
02:27:30,190 --> 02:27:31,590
Just a little bit.

4238
02:27:32,910 --> 02:27:35,090
I made one simple mistake.

4239
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:37,170
Every dad gets one.

4240
02:27:39,150 --> 02:27:41,470
Oh, I think you've had more than one.

4241
02:27:41,530 --> 02:27:42,570
Every dad gets one.

4242
02:27:42,650 --> 02:27:43,490
Every dad gets one.

4243
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:44,170
This is my one.

4244
02:27:44,310 --> 02:27:44,930
This is my one.

4245
02:27:47,070 --> 02:27:48,050
There you go.

4246
02:27:48,130 --> 02:27:49,790
Look at that go.

4247
02:27:50,730 --> 02:27:52,110
Yeah, that's me.

4248
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:55,730
That's me.

4249
02:27:57,650 --> 02:27:58,870
Oh, they're lumberjacking.

4250
02:28:00,450 --> 02:28:01,590
Where are they going?

4251
02:28:06,750 --> 02:28:08,430
Where are they going?

4252
02:28:09,170 --> 02:28:10,210
To the clock.

4253
02:28:10,650 --> 02:28:11,850
This is our mansion?

4254
02:28:12,210 --> 02:28:12,810
Open.

4255
02:28:13,030 --> 02:28:13,950
Where's the clock tower?

4256
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:17,930
Now, to just open this gate.

4257
02:28:18,010 --> 02:28:18,390
Now, to just open this gate.

4258
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:20,110
Why did we open it?

4259
02:28:20,690 --> 02:28:21,210
Why?

4260
02:28:21,390 --> 02:28:21,670
Oh.

4261
02:28:22,530 --> 02:28:23,230
Oh, wait.

4262
02:28:23,290 --> 02:28:23,590
Match.

4263
02:28:23,650 --> 02:28:24,370
Make it match.

4264
02:28:24,670 --> 02:28:25,710
Oh, wait.

4265
02:28:25,810 --> 02:28:26,030
Which...

4266
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:26,870
I'm the tiny one.

4267
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:28,970
I did it.

4268
02:28:35,710 --> 02:28:37,650
Doki is the one who held this marriage.

4269
02:28:37,730 --> 02:28:38,490
What do you mean?

4270
02:28:40,050 --> 02:28:42,370
I am the glue to this marriage.

4271
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:44,250
Without me, this marriage will fall apart.

4272
02:28:47,470 --> 02:28:47,990
Yeah.

4273
02:28:48,750 --> 02:28:50,910
Without me, I provide...

4274
02:28:50,910 --> 02:28:52,710
I provide for this family.

4275
02:28:54,530 --> 02:28:54,970
Oh, no.

4276
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:58,870
I even bought us paper plates, so we...

4277
02:28:58,870 --> 02:28:59,710
I'm working two jobs for us.

4278
02:28:59,790 --> 02:29:02,430
I even bought us paper plates, so we don't have to waste water.

4279
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:04,070
Oh my God, you remind me of my old roommate.

4280
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:06,550
So we don't have to waste water.

4281
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:08,670
See, we're saving water bills.

4282
02:29:10,370 --> 02:29:12,370
We're saving water bills by not...

4283
02:29:12,370 --> 02:29:14,470
Is that why you haven't showered in three weeks?

4284
02:29:14,670 --> 02:29:14,750
is that why you haven't showered in three weeks?

4285
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:16,250
Is that where we're going?

4286
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:18,970
You don't know that.

4287
02:29:19,050 --> 02:29:19,890
but to get inside...

4288
02:29:19,890 --> 02:29:21,150
I can smell it.

4289
02:29:21,150 --> 02:29:21,710
I have clones.

4290
02:29:26,010 --> 02:29:26,890
The clone!

4291
02:29:26,890 --> 02:29:28,590
The clone doesn't do enough.

4292
02:29:39,530 --> 02:29:41,410
He thinks I'm right!

4293
02:29:41,610 --> 02:29:42,890
I told you time doesn't matter!

4294
02:29:43,790 --> 02:29:45,250
Oh my god!

4295
02:29:45,570 --> 02:29:46,350
Hold on!

4296
02:29:46,490 --> 02:29:47,270
Did you know?

4297
02:29:48,010 --> 02:29:49,970
Not did you know, but like...

4298
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:53,890
My friend has a little sibling.

4299
02:29:53,930 --> 02:29:54,450
Yeah?

4300
02:29:54,930 --> 02:29:57,470
Who's... I think 19 now?

4301
02:29:59,770 --> 02:30:00,370
And...

4302
02:30:01,430 --> 02:30:03,490
He like... leaves...

4303
02:30:03,490 --> 02:30:05,550
a little strawberry toothpaste.

4304
02:30:06,290 --> 02:30:10,470
He leaves a little toothpaste on his little sibling's toothbrush.

4305
02:30:11,070 --> 02:30:14,410
To check if their sibling brushes their teeth.

4306
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:15,090
What?

4307
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:18,550
Apparently, the toothpaste has not disappeared.

4308
02:30:18,630 --> 02:30:19,290
It's been leaked.

4309
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:20,570
Oh my god!

4310
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:22,210
They can't!

4311
02:30:24,090 --> 02:30:24,970
That's disgusting!

4312
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:27,190
I know!

4313
02:30:27,630 --> 02:30:28,310
Where are you going?

4314
02:30:28,330 --> 02:30:29,710
Okay, I'll go to the left then.

4315
02:30:29,950 --> 02:30:31,270
But these aren't machines!

4316
02:30:31,650 --> 02:30:32,610
I'm gonna go to the left.

4317
02:30:34,390 --> 02:30:35,830
Wait, what do we do?

4318
02:30:36,010 --> 02:30:36,550
Oh, we have to be at the same one.

4319
02:30:36,670 --> 02:30:37,330
Come here!

4320
02:30:37,330 --> 02:30:38,330
We have to be at the same one?

4321
02:30:38,770 --> 02:30:39,610
Look at that tower!

4322
02:30:40,030 --> 02:30:41,410
We might be able to land on it.

4323
02:30:41,410 --> 02:30:41,730
Okay.

4324
02:30:42,050 --> 02:30:43,390
I thought we had to separate.

4325
02:30:44,790 --> 02:30:45,410
It's fine.

4326
02:30:45,470 --> 02:30:46,070
I'm good at flying.

4327
02:30:47,870 --> 02:30:49,010
Look at me go.

4328
02:30:51,070 --> 02:30:51,890
Don't worry.

4329
02:30:52,110 --> 02:30:53,510
Your hero is here.

4330
02:30:54,770 --> 02:30:56,450
I'm trying to figure out how to get off.

4331
02:30:59,590 --> 02:31:00,910
Look at that.

4332
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:03,010
First try.

4333
02:31:05,870 --> 02:31:07,230
Did the dad make this?

4334
02:31:07,370 --> 02:31:08,370
Yeah, I made this.

4335
02:31:11,390 --> 02:31:13,370
Why is there any castle here?

4336
02:31:14,030 --> 02:31:17,590
Turns out that sibling of my friend's also like...

4337
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:18,770
Oh yeah!

4338
02:31:18,870 --> 02:31:18,990
That's a good thing.

4339
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:21,130
I think they just went to shower because they just wanted to play games.

4340
02:31:21,370 --> 02:31:23,630
What the f- Oh, so he's a NEET!

4341
02:31:25,350 --> 02:31:27,050
He's like, wait, I think this is a puzzle.

4342
02:31:28,630 --> 02:31:30,710
I don't think we know the answer yet, right?

4343
02:31:31,830 --> 02:31:32,230
Do...

4344
02:31:32,230 --> 02:31:33,130
Do sun.

4345
02:31:34,450 --> 02:31:34,850
Why?

4346
02:31:36,190 --> 02:31:37,630
Yeah, I don't think we know the answer yet.

4347
02:31:37,630 --> 02:31:38,650
I think we have to figure it out here.

4348
02:31:38,890 --> 02:31:42,470
But like...

4349
02:31:42,470 --> 02:31:43,770
We don't know the answer.

4350
02:31:44,850 --> 02:31:45,670
Oh, but...

4351
02:31:47,050 --> 02:31:47,890
What the hell?

4352
02:31:49,530 --> 02:31:50,630
Is that sculpture?

4353
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:51,930
Oh shit.

4354
02:31:53,090 --> 02:31:54,090
What does he want?

4355
02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:00,350
Oh, come back.

4356
02:32:05,890 --> 02:32:06,410
Whoa!

4357
02:32:07,730 --> 02:32:09,370
How do I get to the other side?

4358
02:32:12,050 --> 02:32:12,930
Oh, okay!

4359
02:32:13,530 --> 02:32:14,350
Hold on.

4360
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:16,770
Oh, you have... okay.

4361
02:32:17,630 --> 02:32:19,970
Oh, thank god you're on that side and I'm doing this.

4362
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:21,330
Okay, B.

4363
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:21,730
B first.

4364
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:22,510
B first.

4365
02:32:22,750 --> 02:32:23,070
B.

4366
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:24,910
Okay.

4367
02:32:25,650 --> 02:32:26,530
Bird.

4368
02:32:27,370 --> 02:32:28,250
Cat.

4369
02:32:30,350 --> 02:32:30,810
Cat.

4370
02:32:33,530 --> 02:32:34,410
Moon.

4371
02:32:34,750 --> 02:32:35,290
Moon.

4372
02:32:36,230 --> 02:32:37,110
Dog.

4373
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:38,550
Sun.

4374
02:32:39,550 --> 02:32:41,530
We did it!

4375
02:32:41,930 --> 02:32:42,650
Yay!

4376
02:32:43,070 --> 02:32:43,550
Yay!

4377
02:32:45,250 --> 02:32:46,130
Yay!

4378
02:32:46,130 --> 02:32:46,470
Yay!

4379
02:32:47,930 --> 02:32:48,210
Yay!

4380
02:32:48,950 --> 02:32:49,470
Woo!

4381
02:32:51,070 --> 02:32:51,590
Hello.

4382
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:54,090
It's your beautiful husband.

4383
02:32:55,150 --> 02:32:55,670
What?

4384
02:32:57,330 --> 02:32:59,210
Because you marry me for my looks.

4385
02:32:59,350 --> 02:33:00,510
And charm.

4386
02:33:02,310 --> 02:33:02,830
Yeah.

4387
02:33:03,590 --> 02:33:04,530
We did it!

4388
02:33:04,610 --> 02:33:04,850
Wait, what?

4389
02:33:04,970 --> 02:33:06,390
How else did you marry me?

4390
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:09,210
Are we gonna bomb the castle?

4391
02:33:11,230 --> 02:33:11,910
Oh, yeah.

4392
02:33:14,470 --> 02:33:16,030
What's wrong with this game and boss?

4393
02:33:16,030 --> 02:33:17,550
We're gonna bomb in our little kid's place.

4394
02:33:19,210 --> 02:33:21,350
I think they're trying to teach us how to make...

4395
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:23,710
I think we can use them.

4396
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:24,310
What?

4397
02:33:25,510 --> 02:33:27,090
Is this a blimeral messaging?

4398
02:33:29,550 --> 02:33:30,070
What?

4399
02:33:30,070 --> 02:33:33,290
Suddenly, we want to blow castles up.

4400
02:33:36,930 --> 02:33:38,110
All right, my bird.

4401
02:33:39,330 --> 02:33:39,850
Wee!

4402
02:33:41,170 --> 02:33:41,690
Wee!

4403
02:33:42,110 --> 02:33:43,770
Don't worry, I'm not on the list.

4404
02:33:44,530 --> 02:33:45,050
Wee!

4405
02:33:46,130 --> 02:33:47,430
Because I'm not American.

4406
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:47,570
Wee!

4407
02:33:47,590 --> 02:33:47,830
I'm not American.

4408
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:51,510
All right, I'm here.

4409
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:54,570
I made it before you did.

4410
02:33:55,210 --> 02:33:56,790
But I can't get off my bird.

4411
02:33:56,870 --> 02:33:57,770
My bird won't let me.

4412
02:33:58,770 --> 02:34:00,010
How did you get off the bird?

4413
02:34:00,450 --> 02:34:01,310
My bird likes me.

4414
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:02,410
Oh, okay, I did it.

4415
02:34:02,590 --> 02:34:04,690
I had to wait for you to get off the bird.

4416
02:34:05,710 --> 02:34:06,850
No, you did not.

4417
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:12,580
It's because my bird likes me too much.

4418
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:14,140
So she doesn't want me to get off.

4419
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:16,880
I think it's because I had control of my bird.

4420
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:17,960
Goodbye.

4421
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:18,980
Why is it...

4422
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:20,860
It's because it's on green now.

4423
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:21,460
You have to wait.

4424
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:23,660
Yeah, see?

4425
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:25,200
Yeah, you should have waited.

4426
02:34:26,460 --> 02:34:28,400
Why did you jump then?

4427
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:32,460
Because I'm a little special.

4428
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:35,960
Mommy says I'm a special little girl.

4429
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:38,300
Mommy says I'm a special little girl.

4430
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:39,380
You're pissing me off.

4431
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,660
Here, I made the bridge back.

4432
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:46,560
Here.

4433
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,400
How do you go down this bridge?

4434
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:50,980
Do I?

4435
02:34:51,180 --> 02:34:51,460
Yeah.

4436
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:53,460
Because it goes on the red first.

4437
02:34:57,410 --> 02:34:57,810
There.

4438
02:35:01,190 --> 02:35:02,230
What did you do?

4439
02:35:02,970 --> 02:35:04,050
I changed the red to blue.

4440
02:35:04,050 --> 02:35:04,570
Oh, you changed it.

4441
02:35:04,630 --> 02:35:05,290
Oh, okay.

4442
02:35:07,970 --> 02:35:09,490
Oh my gosh, this takes so long.

4443
02:35:12,170 --> 02:35:12,690
Wait, oh.

4444
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:15,030
No, why did you do that?

4445
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:17,830
I didn't think you were ready.

4446
02:35:19,450 --> 02:35:20,970
I was ready.

4447
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:22,430
Jump on a red.

4448
02:35:22,650 --> 02:35:23,970
I did it.

4449
02:35:24,110 --> 02:35:25,390
You have to make it red again.

4450
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:28,230
Why did you have to make it red again?

4451
02:35:29,050 --> 02:35:30,470
It goes green.

4452
02:35:32,430 --> 02:35:34,030
You're yelling at me.

4453
02:35:35,530 --> 02:35:36,470
You're yelling at me.

4454
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:40,110
You're yelling at me.

4455
02:35:41,450 --> 02:35:42,650
You're yelling at me.

4456
02:35:42,650 --> 02:35:43,430
Oh, no.

4457
02:35:48,010 --> 02:35:52,030
I just said don't do well with negative reinforcements.

4458
02:35:52,030 --> 02:35:54,090
I don't...

4459
02:35:54,090 --> 02:36:00,750
I had too much negative reinforcements!

4460
02:36:02,510 --> 02:36:04,250
Do you know what you're doing?

4461
02:36:04,890 --> 02:36:07,170
Yeah, I just... I'll be honest.

4462
02:36:12,860 --> 02:36:14,780
What do I do?

4463
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:17,540
There we go, we did it.

4464
02:36:21,110 --> 02:36:22,420
We did it!

4465
02:36:22,860 --> 02:36:24,300
You're pissing me off.

4466
02:36:25,180 --> 02:36:25,920
Yay!

4467
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,960
I think it's fully stopped.

4468
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:31,880
Like the thing.

4469
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:35,740
So like it won't turn anything else.

4470
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:37,400
Yeah.

4471
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:39,260
Trust me.

4472
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:41,540
Yeah, see jump through it.

4473
02:36:41,580 --> 02:36:41,920
What are you doing?

4474
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:44,880
I don't trust you.

4475
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:45,740
Oh.

4476
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:49,020
Okay, and then...

4477
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:50,200
What are you doing?

4478
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,140
You didn't trust me!

4479
02:36:51,440 --> 02:36:53,740
I can tell you didn't trust me there!

4480
02:36:58,280 --> 02:36:59,000
There you go.

4481
02:36:59,720 --> 02:37:00,320
Yay!

4482
02:37:00,480 --> 02:37:02,340
You're right, I didn't trust you.

4483
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:02,920
Yay!

4484
02:37:05,860 --> 02:37:06,460
Alright.

4485
02:37:07,580 --> 02:37:10,220
I'm spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning.

4486
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:11,880
Spinning, spinning.

4487
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:14,800
Wow!

4488
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:19,130
What the heck is that?

4489
02:37:19,210 --> 02:37:19,730
A force field?

4490
02:37:20,130 --> 02:37:20,530
Yeah.

4491
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:35,420
Wait, what do we do now?

4492
02:37:35,820 --> 02:37:36,720
Where's our crows?

4493
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:39,280
Oh!

4494
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:39,740
There we are.

4495
02:37:39,740 --> 02:37:40,800
I will never forget you, crow.

4496
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:41,980
There we are.

4497
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:44,240
Well, you didn't see anything!

4498
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:46,260
You died.

4499
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:46,400
Oh wow!

4500
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:49,560
Why can't it go through the force field?

4501
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:50,100
Because I don't think it can.

4502
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:52,660
I don't think we've like... we didn't force it enough.

4503
02:37:54,600 --> 02:37:55,560
Wait, we have to...

4504
02:37:55,980 --> 02:37:57,740
Oh, I know what we have to do.

4505
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:58,840
What do we have to do?

4506
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:01,080
Let's see what you can do!

4507
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:02,040
Oh!

4508
02:38:02,820 --> 02:38:03,580
Wait, where did...

4509
02:38:06,160 --> 02:38:07,500
You get it from the sky, man!

4510
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:08,960
Oh, the sky!

4511
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:10,840
Oh my god!

4512
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:13,560
I got the bomb.

4513
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:15,600
Aim.

4514
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:17,980
Oh, okay.

4515
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:19,420
I just aim and throw.

4516
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:20,080
Oh, okay!

4517
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:21,700
I figured it out.

4518
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:22,940
The controller is...

4519
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:23,500
I killed mine!

4520
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:26,300
I killed mine too!

4521
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:28,980
I literally see it alive.

4522
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:30,560
I killed mine too!

4523
02:38:30,660 --> 02:38:31,860
Look, I'm shooting it from here.

4524
02:38:32,780 --> 02:38:34,860
See, I told you I killed mine!

4525
02:38:39,150 --> 02:38:41,030
I told you I did it.

4526
02:38:43,690 --> 02:38:45,350
What the fuck?

4527
02:38:45,390 --> 02:38:46,190
Holy shit.

4528
02:38:49,570 --> 02:38:50,550
Oh, I'm here.

4529
02:38:51,270 --> 02:38:51,870
Yay!

4530
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:56,310
Why are they stuck down there?

4531
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:57,490
I have to rewind.

4532
02:39:00,250 --> 02:39:01,790
Because I need to bring them back up.

4533
02:39:03,250 --> 02:39:03,890
There you go.

4534
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:08,840
Yay!

4535
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:11,200
And then...

4536
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:12,060
And then what?

4537
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:14,040
Go in!

4538
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:16,600
Is there something we have to do?

4539
02:39:23,170 --> 02:39:24,010
What do we have to do?

4540
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:29,730
We need something.

4541
02:39:34,530 --> 02:39:35,390
What the fuck?

4542
02:39:36,810 --> 02:39:37,770
Oh, maybe...

4543
02:39:38,830 --> 02:39:41,610
Oh, you have to get the wall jump to the other side.

4544
02:39:44,130 --> 02:39:45,830
I like my bird.

4545
02:39:46,510 --> 02:39:48,110
Gumi, you have to wall jump to the other side.

4546
02:39:48,330 --> 02:39:50,650
Gumi, I'm literally doing this right now.

4547
02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:52,750
I like my bird.

4548
02:39:52,870 --> 02:39:55,450
We can take the bird home after.

4549
02:39:59,450 --> 02:40:00,070
That's cool.

4550
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:00,690
I like this.

4551
02:40:00,730 --> 02:40:01,490
I like this mechanism.

4552
02:40:02,550 --> 02:40:03,470
I like this.

4553
02:40:04,410 --> 02:40:04,890
Yay!

4554
02:40:06,190 --> 02:40:06,510
Woo!

4555
02:40:06,810 --> 02:40:07,770
I like my bird.

4556
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:13,570
You lied to me.

4557
02:40:14,530 --> 02:40:15,890
I don't like that sound.

4558
02:40:16,290 --> 02:40:17,990
Do we really have to follow them?

4559
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:18,490
Yes!

4560
02:40:18,610 --> 02:40:19,710
We'll never get out of here.

4561
02:40:20,310 --> 02:40:20,790
Fine.

4562
02:40:21,610 --> 02:40:22,310
Ladies first.

4563
02:40:22,910 --> 02:40:23,850
What the fuck?

4564
02:40:24,270 --> 02:40:24,970
Ladies first.

4565
02:40:26,030 --> 02:40:26,930
I'm a gentleman.

4566
02:40:28,610 --> 02:40:29,830
I'm letting you go first.

4567
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:30,170
See?

4568
02:40:30,590 --> 02:40:32,250
We both were to drop down anyway.

4569
02:40:34,370 --> 02:40:34,850
May!

4570
02:40:35,090 --> 02:40:36,550
May, is that wall moving?

4571
02:40:36,790 --> 02:40:37,270
Yes!

4572
02:40:37,310 --> 02:40:37,510
What?

4573
02:40:37,510 --> 02:40:38,810
Oh shit.

4574
02:40:38,850 --> 02:40:39,750
I built this.

4575
02:40:39,910 --> 02:40:40,390
There's nowhere to run!

4576
02:40:42,590 --> 02:40:44,130
Why did I build this?

4577
02:40:44,530 --> 02:40:44,550
May!

4578
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:44,870
May, do something!

4579
02:40:45,190 --> 02:40:45,470
What?

4580
02:40:45,590 --> 02:40:46,030
Me?

4581
02:40:46,290 --> 02:40:47,450
You do something!

4582
02:40:47,590 --> 02:40:48,510
Yeah, you do something!

4583
02:40:50,190 --> 02:40:51,070
Someone help!

4584
02:40:51,910 --> 02:40:52,350
Someone help!

4585
02:40:52,350 --> 02:40:52,670
Uh...

4586
02:40:53,150 --> 02:40:53,590
Uh...

4587
02:40:54,050 --> 02:40:54,490
Uh...

4588
02:40:54,490 --> 02:40:55,310
Hurry up!

4589
02:40:55,890 --> 02:40:56,990
Wait, what did you do?

4590
02:40:57,510 --> 02:40:59,030
I almost thought we wouldn't make it.

4591
02:40:59,210 --> 02:40:59,650
Almost?

4592
02:40:59,870 --> 02:41:01,190
I was a genius, that's why.

4593
02:41:01,490 --> 02:41:02,350
I know what you did!

4594
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:03,950
We made it!

4595
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:05,870
You put a clone on the other side!

4596
02:41:05,950 --> 02:41:06,510
Oh my god, look!

4597
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:07,190
Tiny rats!

4598
02:41:07,190 --> 02:41:07,430
They're not tiny rats!

4599
02:41:07,430 --> 02:41:07,490
They're not tiny rats!

4600
02:41:07,510 --> 02:41:08,130
Tiny rats!

4601
02:41:08,530 --> 02:41:09,890
Oh my god, look at these rats!

4602
02:41:10,410 --> 02:41:10,930
Rats!

4603
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:11,490
Tiny rats!

4604
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:12,210
Rats!

4605
02:41:12,210 --> 02:41:12,390
Rats!

4606
02:41:12,390 --> 02:41:13,710
We are the rats!

4607
02:41:16,570 --> 02:41:18,210
Okay, time to rewind.

4608
02:41:18,850 --> 02:41:21,930
You're playing a suck at night here, a rat.

4609
02:41:23,150 --> 02:41:24,170
Where are we opening?

4610
02:41:24,570 --> 02:41:26,610
Oh, we're closing the door.

4611
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:28,650
No, we're going up.

4612
02:41:28,990 --> 02:41:30,950
Yeah, we close the door and go up.

4613
02:41:31,090 --> 02:41:32,930
Both things can happen, Gumi!

4614
02:41:33,250 --> 02:41:34,910
You can multitask!

4615
02:41:36,730 --> 02:41:37,490
Look, there's a door!

4616
02:41:37,490 --> 02:41:37,830
There's us!

4617
02:41:39,610 --> 02:41:40,430
There's us!

4618
02:41:40,710 --> 02:41:41,730
What a magnificent place!

4619
02:41:42,050 --> 02:41:42,450
Yeah!

4620
02:41:42,450 --> 02:41:43,710
Oh my god, it's so beautiful!

4621
02:41:44,190 --> 02:41:44,950
It's full of medical parts!

4622
02:41:45,170 --> 02:41:46,550
With no real functionality!

4623
02:41:46,570 --> 02:41:47,690
I get this smile.

4624
02:41:48,150 --> 02:41:51,390
This place is beautiful, but it doesn't make any sense!

4625
02:41:51,790 --> 02:41:54,650
Why do you always have to make sense of everything?

4626
02:41:54,690 --> 02:41:54,990
Yeah!

4627
02:41:55,630 --> 02:41:56,230
Someone has to!

4628
02:41:56,630 --> 02:41:57,730
And I know it's not you!

4629
02:41:57,730 --> 02:41:58,390
Someone has to?

4630
02:41:58,590 --> 02:42:01,750
Baby, you can't explain every little thing that happens in life!

4631
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:03,090
You need a fun dad!

4632
02:42:04,010 --> 02:42:04,190
I need one in general!

4633
02:42:04,770 --> 02:42:07,230
We all know the good cop is the dad!

4634
02:42:07,430 --> 02:42:07,450
I need one in general!

4635
02:42:07,450 --> 02:42:08,810
The bad cop is the dad and the bad cop is the mom!

4636
02:42:10,410 --> 02:42:10,850
What?

4637
02:42:10,870 --> 02:42:11,610
I'm the fun dad!

4638
02:42:12,390 --> 02:42:13,410
I'm the fun dad!

4639
02:42:14,390 --> 02:42:19,270
So, like, when our daughter is mad, she yells at you and then when she wants to have fun, she goes to me!

4640
02:42:21,810 --> 02:42:23,510
It's like typical parenting!

4641
02:42:24,470 --> 02:42:26,330
I don't like the look of that guy!

4642
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:27,730
Oh, that's supposedly normal!

4643
02:42:28,070 --> 02:42:29,230
It's so normal!

4644
02:42:29,770 --> 02:42:32,790
The dad takes you out to have fun and have...

4645
02:42:32,790 --> 02:42:34,850
The gatekeeper!

4646
02:42:35,290 --> 02:42:36,430
What the fuck?

4647
02:42:36,710 --> 02:42:37,350
Wait, what?

4648
02:42:37,430 --> 02:42:38,030
What the fuck?

4649
02:42:39,030 --> 02:42:41,350
Bro, what the fuck is that?

4650
02:42:44,330 --> 02:42:45,710
Wait, where do we supposed to go?

4651
02:42:47,010 --> 02:42:47,830
I'm going here.

4652
02:42:49,910 --> 02:42:51,170
I don't know where I am.

4653
02:42:51,290 --> 02:42:51,930
Go, go!

4654
02:42:52,890 --> 02:42:53,710
Where am I?

4655
02:42:57,820 --> 02:42:58,600
Where are you?

4656
02:42:59,360 --> 02:43:01,340
Wait, I think we went on the wrong area!

4657
02:43:01,700 --> 02:43:03,640
Okay, I'm going back to you!

4658
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:06,980
What do you mean, we went on the wrong area?

4659
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:08,440
We went on the wrong side.

4660
02:43:08,780 --> 02:43:09,160
I don't know.

4661
02:43:11,620 --> 02:43:13,220
Oh my god, it's a Keyblade!

4662
02:43:17,180 --> 02:43:18,020
I'm here.

4663
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:20,140
Holy what?

4664
02:43:22,380 --> 02:43:23,180
I'm here.

4665
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:26,080
Woah, are you okay?

4666
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:27,520
Woah!

4667
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:32,020
I'm heading over.

4668
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:34,200
Don't worry.

4669
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:36,660
Fun Dad's coming.

4670
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:39,640
Hello, sweetie.

4671
02:43:39,740 --> 02:43:40,920
Fun Dad is here.

4672
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:43,500
Are we sure this is the right way?

4673
02:43:45,180 --> 02:43:46,020
Are you sure?

4674
02:43:46,320 --> 02:43:47,340
I feel like we're supposed to...

4675
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:47,860
REWIND IT!

4676
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:49,200
I can't reach!

4677
02:43:49,260 --> 02:43:49,760
Oh, I could.

4678
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:50,260
Okay.

4679
02:43:51,320 --> 02:43:51,820
Yay.

4680
02:43:58,560 --> 02:43:59,360
There we go.

4681
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:04,480
And then you have to put your clone.

4682
02:44:07,460 --> 02:44:08,460
And then...

4683
02:44:11,570 --> 02:44:12,190
Ta-da!

4684
02:44:13,310 --> 02:44:15,010
And then we go this way.

4685
02:44:16,070 --> 02:44:17,710
And then clone time.

4686
02:44:18,930 --> 02:44:22,810
I'm glad I'm the time person so I can do less work.

4687
02:44:24,330 --> 02:44:24,890
Oh.

4688
02:44:29,810 --> 02:44:32,110
I'm glad this is where I'm at.

4689
02:44:35,770 --> 02:44:36,330
Alright.

4690
02:44:36,530 --> 02:44:37,990
And then...

4691
02:44:39,830 --> 02:44:41,870
We can do it higher up here, right?

4692
02:44:43,590 --> 02:44:44,030
eta

4693
02:44:49,850 --> 02:44:51,050
Where does this turn?

4694
02:44:53,530 --> 02:44:53,970
Okay.

4695
02:44:54,090 --> 02:44:55,450
And then where does this turn?

4696
02:44:58,910 --> 02:44:59,930
Nowhere you had to go.

4697
02:45:01,650 --> 02:45:02,990
Where you had to go from here?

4698
02:45:03,950 --> 02:45:04,830
You've turned it.

4699
02:45:05,290 --> 02:45:08,070
I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning!

4700
02:45:08,370 --> 02:45:09,510
Oh I think I turn too fast.

4701
02:45:10,250 --> 02:45:11,270
Where are you supposed to go?

4702
02:45:11,330 --> 02:45:12,710
Wait, wait, wait!

4703
02:45:12,970 --> 02:45:13,330
Wait!

4704
02:45:15,070 --> 02:45:17,490
At least you don't have to do it all the way.

4705
02:45:18,770 --> 02:45:19,990
Where are you?

4706
02:45:20,810 --> 02:45:21,650
Oh, you're here.

4707
02:45:21,930 --> 02:45:22,670
Okay, I'm gonna...

4708
02:45:22,670 --> 02:45:23,830
Oh, I can't see.

4709
02:45:26,410 --> 02:45:28,110
I hate this camera angle.

4710
02:45:28,210 --> 02:45:28,430
Okay.

4711
02:45:30,070 --> 02:45:30,510
Ready?

4712
02:45:30,850 --> 02:45:31,590
Are you ready?

4713
02:45:32,670 --> 02:45:33,390
Just drop down.

4714
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:38,420
Here, see?

4715
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:39,740
And then I just turn.

4716
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:40,640
And I just turn.

4717
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:42,940
You just have to run with the thing.

4718
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:44,020
And I just turn.

4719
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:46,260
Okay, then what?

4720
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:48,900
I've turned the wrong way.

4721
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:49,280
Sorry.

4722
02:45:51,140 --> 02:45:52,100
That's what I thought.

4723
02:45:54,220 --> 02:45:55,140
Wait, and then what?

4724
02:45:55,280 --> 02:45:56,300
How do you get to the other side?

4725
02:45:58,120 --> 02:45:59,540
I guess you put your clone?

4726
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:01,980
You put your clone or something?

4727
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:02,580
Wait!

4728
02:46:03,220 --> 02:46:03,880
Wait, wait, wait!

4729
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:04,420
I see it.

4730
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:07,380
Yeah, but you have to...

4731
02:46:07,380 --> 02:46:08,100
You can't get there.

4732
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:10,820
There's no way you can get there.

4733
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:12,460
You have to put your clone.

4734
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:15,400
Put my clone where?

4735
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:16,700
I don't know.

4736
02:46:16,820 --> 02:46:17,240
Somewhere.

4737
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:23,400
Why do you turn it without saying anything?

4738
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:24,060
Why do you turn it without saying anything?

4739
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:24,080
Why do you turn it without saying anything?

4740
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:25,680
You can look at the visuals!

4741
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:29,600
I'm lucky to see how we get there!

4742
02:46:29,980 --> 02:46:30,800
Okay, I turned it.

4743
02:46:30,820 --> 02:46:31,760
Maybe put a clone here.

4744
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:33,400
Clone where?

4745
02:46:33,780 --> 02:46:34,800
Just where you're standing.

4746
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:35,980
Yeah, see?

4747
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:41,640
No, not now!

4748
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:45,180
What do you even see?

4749
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:47,420
Okay, just put that here.

4750
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:49,720
And now I want to keep turning.

4751
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:51,860
Because it gets closer!

4752
02:46:53,900 --> 02:46:55,780
When I turn it, you see that?

4753
02:46:55,900 --> 02:46:56,780
It gets closer.

4754
02:46:57,560 --> 02:46:59,900
I don't think my clone moves with it, does it?

4755
02:47:00,380 --> 02:47:02,440
No, like the thingy turns.

4756
02:47:02,660 --> 02:47:04,160
The thingy gets closer.

4757
02:47:05,580 --> 02:47:06,440
What thingy?

4758
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:07,560
So like, okay.

4759
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:10,700
So if I turn it all the way to the other side...

4760
02:47:12,240 --> 02:47:13,860
It like gets closer.

4761
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:17,280
Like the other thing gets closer.

4762
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:20,200
Doesn't it?

4763
02:47:21,720 --> 02:47:23,800
You're pissing me off.

4764
02:47:24,100 --> 02:47:25,080
I'm so confused.

4765
02:47:25,580 --> 02:47:26,260
I'm confused.

4766
02:47:26,740 --> 02:47:27,900
My brain hurts.

4767
02:47:28,980 --> 02:47:30,500
My brain hurts.

4768
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:34,120
My brain hurts.

4769
02:47:34,120 --> 02:47:36,860
It turned this way the entire time?

4770
02:47:37,220 --> 02:47:39,660
And you just stopped turning it?

4771
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:40,680
And you just stopped turning it?

4772
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:46,900
And you just stopped turning it?

4773
02:47:46,900 --> 02:47:48,500
We did it!

4774
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:50,920
Oh my god, we did it!

4775
02:47:51,750 --> 02:47:52,620
We did it!

4776
02:47:52,620 --> 02:47:54,400
Why did you stop turning it?

4777
02:47:57,560 --> 02:48:00,280
Oh my god, we did it!

4778
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:00,860
Oh my god, we did it!

4779
02:48:01,720 --> 02:48:04,460
I'm so proud of us!

4780
02:48:04,460 --> 02:48:07,680
I thought there was a limit to how much you could turn!

4781
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:08,760
We did it!

4782
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:09,260
Yay!

4783
02:48:12,100 --> 02:48:12,740
Woo!

4784
02:48:14,460 --> 02:48:15,820
We did it!

4785
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:18,340
Yay!

4786
02:48:22,020 --> 02:48:22,660
Yay!

4787
02:48:23,940 --> 02:48:24,580
Yay!

4788
02:48:24,580 --> 02:48:25,120
Oh my god.

4789
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:27,400
Oh my god.

4790
02:48:28,660 --> 02:48:29,840
Get over here.

4791
02:48:29,940 --> 02:48:31,860
Wait, I thought we had to do one ear.

4792
02:48:32,220 --> 02:48:32,860
Oh.

4793
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:36,340
Okay, I'll turn the key?

4794
02:48:36,520 --> 02:48:37,840
Okay, I'm coming back to turn the key.

4795
02:48:39,480 --> 02:48:41,200
It's time to turn the keyblade.

4796
02:48:42,860 --> 02:48:43,540
Here you go.

4797
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:45,060
Hey, come back.

4798
02:48:45,220 --> 02:48:45,680
What are you doing?

4799
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:47,760
Don't you want to turn the key?

4800
02:48:49,240 --> 02:48:50,900
No, I don't want to turn the key.

4801
02:48:50,940 --> 02:48:51,400
Why not?

4802
02:48:52,340 --> 02:48:54,120
Fun Dad does it again!

4803
02:48:54,640 --> 02:48:56,140
Makes fun for everybody!

4804
02:48:56,300 --> 02:48:56,740
See?

4805
02:48:57,700 --> 02:49:02,160
I'm here to make this a fun, enjoyable time for all the kids to enjoy.

4806
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:05,080
I'm turning it.

4807
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:07,380
Oh!

4808
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:08,760
I think we have to go back.

4809
02:49:09,400 --> 02:49:11,120
Not here, but like back here.

4810
02:49:11,500 --> 02:49:13,280
Because there's another time thing here.

4811
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:15,160
See that?

4812
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:17,560
And then there's another one here too.

4813
02:49:18,220 --> 02:49:19,700
I think I have to do the wall thing here.

4814
02:49:22,960 --> 02:49:24,540
And then I do this.

4815
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:28,220
Okay, and then I do this.

4816
02:49:30,040 --> 02:49:30,900
Isn't it great?

4817
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:32,560
I can just sit back and relax.

4818
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,580
Alright, and then...

4819
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:38,140
Here you go.

4820
02:49:39,320 --> 02:49:40,280
And then...

4821
02:49:40,760 --> 02:49:42,660
Let me know when you're ready to do that.

4822
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:44,560
Now you have to jump.

4823
02:49:44,660 --> 02:49:45,260
For this.

4824
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:49,360
Okay, you ready?

4825
02:49:49,560 --> 02:49:50,020
Okay, I'm ready.

4826
02:49:51,340 --> 02:49:51,820
Yeah!

4827
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:54,400
Fun Dad does it again!

4828
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:56,680
There you go.

4829
02:49:57,720 --> 02:49:58,640
Let me know...

4830
02:49:58,640 --> 02:49:59,420
Boom!

4831
02:50:02,380 --> 02:50:03,660
And then...

4832
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:05,040
Burn.

4833
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:10,080
Wait till I get lower first?

4834
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:11,560
Okay.

4835
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:12,960
Yeah!

4836
02:50:15,400 --> 02:50:16,620
I know we did it!

4837
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:18,460
Oh, what the fuck?

4838
02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:19,280
What happened?

4839
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:21,140
I just died.

4840
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:22,780
Rewind it, rewind it.

4841
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:24,100
I was too close.

4842
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:25,320
Wait, what?

4843
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:29,180
I rewind it.

4844
02:50:29,300 --> 02:50:30,020
How do we...

4845
02:50:31,380 --> 02:50:32,640
Do I have to be under it?

4846
02:50:32,900 --> 02:50:34,200
No, that doesn't seem right.

4847
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:35,300
Yeah, it doesn't seem right.

4848
02:50:36,400 --> 02:50:37,500
How do we cut this?

4849
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:39,460
Well, we cut it already.

4850
02:50:39,820 --> 02:50:42,260
Yeah, but how do we get inside?

4851
02:50:44,420 --> 02:50:44,820
Oh!

4852
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:45,580
Wait, wait, wait.

4853
02:50:45,980 --> 02:50:46,740
Bring it back up?

4854
02:50:47,240 --> 02:50:47,640
Yeah.

4855
02:50:50,680 --> 02:50:51,080
Okay.

4856
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:51,560
Oh!

4857
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:53,020
You're so smart!

4858
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:55,420
You're so smart, wife.

4859
02:50:57,860 --> 02:50:58,260
Stop!

4860
02:50:58,840 --> 02:50:59,580
Okay, there we go.

4861
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:00,400
Bring it...

4862
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:03,040
Wait.

4863
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:03,560
Yeah.

4864
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:05,340
Boom!

4865
02:51:05,340 --> 02:51:06,260
We did it!

4866
02:51:07,460 --> 02:51:07,980
See?

4867
02:51:08,700 --> 02:51:09,220
Teamwork!

4868
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:11,520
Fun dad, fun dad.

4869
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:12,040
Let's go.

4870
02:51:16,480 --> 02:51:17,000
Alright.

4871
02:51:19,480 --> 02:51:20,260
What did...

4872
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:22,160
Oh, do we have to turn it together?

4873
02:51:22,860 --> 02:51:23,700
Are that...

4874
02:51:23,700 --> 02:51:27,440
No, like we both have to turn one of it together, right?

4875
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:28,920
Yeah, cause I can't.

4876
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:29,740
I'm too weak.

4877
02:51:30,220 --> 02:51:31,860
Fun dad is a little flabby.

4878
02:51:39,220 --> 02:51:39,740
Oh!

4879
02:51:39,740 --> 02:51:40,100
Where do we...

4880
02:51:40,100 --> 02:51:40,680
The key.

4881
02:51:40,780 --> 02:51:41,440
Is this the key?

4882
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:43,980
Oh, and then we... the other one turns it down.

4883
02:51:47,480 --> 02:51:48,000
Alright.

4884
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:48,680
Here we go.

4885
02:51:50,100 --> 02:51:51,220
And we do this.

4886
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:53,120
Yeah!

4887
02:51:55,240 --> 02:51:56,280
Oh, shit.

4888
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:57,440
We did it!

4889
02:51:58,380 --> 02:52:00,020
Who the fuck's making this shit?

4890
02:52:01,560 --> 02:52:05,900
How... we... we haven't even finished one chapter yet, I feel like.

4891
02:52:05,940 --> 02:52:06,260
We did!

4892
02:52:06,500 --> 02:52:09,880
We finished the... We finished the Princess Cutie chapter!

4893
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:11,140
That was a chapter?

4894
02:52:12,480 --> 02:52:13,000
Yeah...

4895
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:14,240
Oh my god!

4896
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:15,960
What is that?

4897
02:52:16,280 --> 02:52:16,940
I don't know!

4898
02:52:19,410 --> 02:52:20,390
What's going on?

4899
02:52:21,830 --> 02:52:22,910
Oh my god!

4900
02:52:23,370 --> 02:52:24,450
Oh god, how do we kill this?

4901
02:52:25,210 --> 02:52:25,950
Wait, wait, wait.

4902
02:52:25,950 --> 02:52:26,790
There's a time in here.

4903
02:52:26,910 --> 02:52:27,330
Distract him!

4904
02:52:27,450 --> 02:52:27,830
Distract him!

4905
02:52:27,830 --> 02:52:27,890
Distract him!

4906
02:52:28,450 --> 02:52:30,850
I don't think the bull cares, Cody!

4907
02:52:31,230 --> 02:52:31,670
Oh!

4908
02:52:32,890 --> 02:52:34,110
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4909
02:52:34,110 --> 02:52:36,190
I need you to lead the bull right here!

4910
02:52:36,510 --> 02:52:37,450
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

4911
02:52:37,450 --> 02:52:37,450
I need you to lead the bull right here!

4912
02:52:37,450 --> 02:52:39,230
Lead him right here, I think.

4913
02:52:39,370 --> 02:52:41,110
Hey, maybe you can trick him with your clone!

4914
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:43,130
Yes, trick him with your clone!

4915
02:52:44,650 --> 02:52:47,010
That stone plate looks like it could hurt it!

4916
02:52:48,050 --> 02:52:48,450
Yeah!

4917
02:52:51,030 --> 02:52:52,570
Is he gonna go there?

4918
02:52:52,890 --> 02:52:54,190
Oh, it's gonna charge!

4919
02:52:57,210 --> 02:52:57,810
Wait, what?

4920
02:52:57,830 --> 02:52:58,110
What?

4921
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:01,270
Where are you charging?

4922
02:53:01,470 --> 02:53:01,650
Oh!

4923
02:53:01,930 --> 02:53:02,390
Me!

4924
02:53:03,470 --> 02:53:03,930
Me!

4925
02:53:05,390 --> 02:53:06,310
Oh, fuck!

4926
02:53:09,640 --> 02:53:10,400
I'm dead.

4927
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:12,600
Bro, what the fuck?

4928
02:53:12,820 --> 02:53:15,040
Okay, I don't have to be next to it to do this.

4929
02:53:15,280 --> 02:53:16,080
Put your clone!

4930
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:17,400
Put your clone over there!

4931
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:19,760
Oh, fuck!

4932
02:53:20,100 --> 02:53:21,020
It's me again!

4933
02:53:23,760 --> 02:53:24,220
Okay.

4934
02:53:24,620 --> 02:53:26,320
You have to put your clone over there!

4935
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:29,220
Stinky shit!

4936
02:53:29,580 --> 02:53:30,440
Shut up!

4937
02:53:33,420 --> 02:53:34,440
Watch out, me!

4938
02:53:35,160 --> 02:53:35,760
Okay.

4939
02:53:37,080 --> 02:53:38,280
He's distracted.

4940
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:39,980
He's distracted.

4941
02:53:40,540 --> 02:53:41,620
I got it.

4942
02:53:42,080 --> 02:53:43,540
He doesn't see me.

4943
02:53:45,240 --> 02:53:45,840
Yeah!

4944
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:51,460
We got him!

4945
02:53:51,620 --> 02:53:52,420
We did it!

4946
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:54,080
Hey, I got it!

4947
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:55,720
Just a couple more hits, okay?

4948
02:53:56,340 --> 02:53:57,460
He doesn't see me.

4949
02:53:58,340 --> 02:53:59,780
Guys, I don't think he saw me.

4950
02:54:04,630 --> 02:54:05,070
Ow!

4951
02:54:05,270 --> 02:54:05,890
It's okay.

4952
02:54:05,930 --> 02:54:06,690
He didn't see me.

4953
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:07,630
I can stand here.

4954
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:13,160
Yeah!

4955
02:54:14,580 --> 02:54:15,180
Wait, what?

4956
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:17,440
Wait, what?

4957
02:54:21,100 --> 02:54:22,020
Okay, it's fine.

4958
02:54:22,760 --> 02:54:23,540
It's fine.

4959
02:54:23,720 --> 02:54:24,300
It's fine.

4960
02:54:24,580 --> 02:54:24,820
What?

4961
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:25,660
It's fine?

4962
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,020
Ow, it's fine.

4963
02:54:28,020 --> 02:54:28,300
Ow!

4964
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:30,780
Give me a sec.

4965
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:33,220
It's okay.

4966
02:54:33,300 --> 02:54:33,720
I'm okay.

4967
02:54:33,980 --> 02:54:35,000
He doesn't see me.

4968
02:54:35,860 --> 02:54:36,740
Here you go.

4969
02:54:36,840 --> 02:54:37,920
I can stand here.

4970
02:54:40,580 --> 02:54:41,180
Yay!

4971
02:54:44,500 --> 02:54:45,440
Bow down!

4972
02:54:45,940 --> 02:54:46,860
He can stand?

4973
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:49,240
I should have done it!

4974
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:50,060
Okay.

4975
02:54:50,660 --> 02:54:52,340
Oh, I got body stabbed!

4976
02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:53,320
Why me?

4977
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:56,160
Why me?

4978
02:54:58,240 --> 02:54:58,960
I'm not ready!

4979
02:54:58,960 --> 02:54:59,700
What did I do?

4980
02:55:01,320 --> 02:55:02,040
What did I do?

4981
02:55:02,040 --> 02:55:03,080
Don't come near me!

4982
02:55:03,180 --> 02:55:04,300
I'm not ready!

4983
02:55:05,020 --> 02:55:06,860
Don't come near me!

4984
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:11,240
I can't even see!

4985
02:55:11,400 --> 02:55:13,440
I can't even see!

4986
02:55:13,440 --> 02:55:14,620
I did it!

4987
02:55:14,920 --> 02:55:15,940
It's okay.

4988
02:55:16,140 --> 02:55:17,380
Thank you for the bait.

4989
02:55:18,940 --> 02:55:20,680
You're pissing me off!

4990
02:55:20,820 --> 02:55:22,220
You left the club there!

4991
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:24,680
I did it.

4992
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:25,560
That was a tough one.

4993
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:27,140
I'm exhausted!

4994
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:28,300
Yay!

4995
02:55:28,600 --> 02:55:30,320
We better keep moving!

4996
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:31,120
Come on!

4997
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:35,000
I did it!

4998
02:55:35,720 --> 02:55:37,440
I'm so proud of us!

4999
02:55:37,660 --> 02:55:39,120
Oh god!

5000
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:41,180
Yay!

5001
02:55:44,560 --> 02:55:46,400
Hard work!

5002
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:48,900
So hard, I know, right?

5003
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:55,400
Cody understands the hard work of this marriage.

5004
02:55:56,840 --> 02:55:58,200
I wonder if like...

5005
02:55:58,200 --> 02:55:59,020
Can you ward?

5006
02:55:59,260 --> 02:56:00,200
Oh, you can!

5007
02:56:00,520 --> 02:56:01,740
But like, why would you?

5008
02:56:02,360 --> 02:56:03,580
I think we have to ward...

5009
02:56:03,580 --> 02:56:05,420
Ward jump this, right?

5010
02:56:10,270 --> 02:56:10,990
Do we?

5011
02:56:13,250 --> 02:56:14,690
Why else would like...

5012
02:56:14,690 --> 02:56:15,410
I'm so confused.

5013
02:56:15,530 --> 02:56:16,330
Why is it like that?

5014
02:56:21,330 --> 02:56:22,190
Hello, wife.

5015
02:56:22,450 --> 02:56:24,190
I need... I need to eat a thumbs.

5016
02:56:24,990 --> 02:56:25,890
Hello, wife.

5017
02:56:28,970 --> 02:56:29,870
I don't understand.

5018
02:56:32,730 --> 02:56:33,210
Okay.

5019
02:56:33,230 --> 02:56:33,610
Okay.

5020
02:56:33,770 --> 02:56:34,050
Okay.

5021
02:56:37,570 --> 02:56:38,050
Alright.

5022
02:56:38,370 --> 02:56:38,910
Okay, do it.

5023
02:56:40,810 --> 02:56:41,290
Alright.

5024
02:56:41,550 --> 02:56:42,030
Um...

5025
02:56:42,030 --> 02:56:43,350
That's why I don't think so.

5026
02:56:45,250 --> 02:56:45,730
What?

5027
02:56:46,390 --> 02:56:47,490
This doesn't make sense.

5028
02:56:55,470 --> 02:56:56,710
What the fuck do we do?

5029
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:02,840
Okay, I gotta help you ward jump.

5030
02:57:03,140 --> 02:57:04,680
How do I help you ward jump though?

5031
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:08,900
How do I help you ward jump though?

5032
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:09,040
Um...

5033
02:57:17,420 --> 02:57:18,640
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

5034
02:57:19,140 --> 02:57:19,160
Okay.

5035
02:57:19,180 --> 02:57:19,200
Okay.

5036
02:57:19,220 --> 02:57:19,240
Okay.

5037
02:57:19,260 --> 02:57:19,280
Okay.

5038
02:57:19,300 --> 02:57:19,400
Okay.

5039
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:22,300
Okay.

5040
02:57:26,300 --> 02:57:26,580
Okay.

5041
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:29,780
I'm making it close.

5042
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:31,980
I'm making this easier for you.

5043
02:57:34,960 --> 02:57:35,640
Yay!

5044
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:38,280
You make...

5045
02:57:38,280 --> 02:57:40,940
Fun dad.

5046
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:41,640
Fun dad.

5047
02:57:43,020 --> 02:57:45,040
I wanna divorce immediately.

5048
02:57:54,220 --> 02:57:56,440
Oh, I gotta stand up here.

5049
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:57,840
And then go...

5050
02:57:57,840 --> 02:57:57,860
...

5051
02:58:02,920 --> 02:58:04,640
Fun dad's coming over.

5052
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:06,840
And then go...

5053
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:07,380
Here I am.

5054
02:58:08,780 --> 02:58:09,720
Here we go.

5055
02:58:12,200 --> 02:58:12,860
Here I am.

5056
02:58:12,860 --> 02:58:13,220
We did it.

5057
02:58:15,180 --> 02:58:17,220
I think I have to...

5058
02:58:17,980 --> 02:58:19,800
I think, um...

5059
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:21,620
Hey.

5060
02:58:22,180 --> 02:58:24,200
I think you have to come back here.

5061
02:58:24,660 --> 02:58:25,300
Why?

5062
02:58:26,520 --> 02:58:30,680
Because I need you to stand on the button so I can put my clone there.

5063
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:33,140
And stand on the button so you can get over.

5064
02:58:33,420 --> 02:58:34,680
So we both can get over.

5065
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:35,080
Oh!

5066
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:37,300
Wait, you're not over?

5067
02:58:38,620 --> 02:58:39,580
I can't!

5068
02:58:39,580 --> 02:58:40,420
I can't!

5069
02:58:40,620 --> 02:58:42,160
Don't worry, I'm coming over.

5070
02:58:42,220 --> 02:58:42,740
Don't worry.

5071
02:58:44,120 --> 02:58:44,740
Don't worry.

5072
02:58:45,620 --> 02:58:46,680
Daddy's coming over.

5073
02:58:48,300 --> 02:58:50,460
Cause daddy's home for me.

5074
02:58:50,460 --> 02:58:50,880
Here he goes.

5075
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:52,680
Okay,

5076
02:58:56,060 --> 02:58:56,600
now you can go.

5077
02:58:56,780 --> 02:58:57,380
Yay!

5078
02:58:58,820 --> 02:59:01,420
Oh my god, what the fuck?

5079
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:05,680
Yay!

5080
02:59:07,960 --> 02:59:08,560
Look,

5081
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:12,500
there's...

5082
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:13,420
Oh, we met up together!

5083
02:59:13,620 --> 02:59:13,820
Look!

5084
02:59:14,260 --> 02:59:16,020
We're back, we're okay now!

5085
02:59:17,100 --> 02:59:17,940
Now, kiss.

5086
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:21,120
Oh, what?

5087
02:59:21,220 --> 02:59:21,260
Oh!

5088
02:59:22,480 --> 02:59:23,360
Hey, what's this?

5089
02:59:24,320 --> 02:59:25,700
We just jump over?

5090
02:59:28,060 --> 02:59:29,560
Oh, I guess we just jump over.

5091
02:59:29,800 --> 02:59:30,340
What if I just...

5092
02:59:30,340 --> 02:59:30,580
Oh!

5093
02:59:30,640 --> 02:59:31,640
Don't stand in the center!

5094
02:59:31,780 --> 02:59:32,820
Don't stand in the center!

5095
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:36,180
I don't think I was planning on it.

5096
02:59:36,260 --> 02:59:37,340
It's Mario Party.

5097
02:59:37,740 --> 02:59:38,820
It's the jump rope.

5098
02:59:40,700 --> 02:59:41,660
It's the jump rope.

5099
02:59:41,780 --> 02:59:42,620
Watch this 360.

5100
02:59:42,900 --> 02:59:43,280
Is this hot?

5101
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:46,480
No!

5102
02:59:48,580 --> 02:59:49,400
I knew that!

5103
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:50,360
Wait, it's...

5104
02:59:50,360 --> 02:59:52,700
The chest is not even stopped there!

5105
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:55,460
What the fuck?

5106
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:59,620
I was relying on you to say a lot so I can fuck around!

5107
03:00:01,960 --> 03:00:04,000
But look at this 360 there.

5108
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:04,520
Whoa!

5109
03:00:05,940 --> 03:00:07,720
That 360 sucks.

5110
03:00:10,200 --> 03:00:11,120
I'm good.

5111
03:00:11,200 --> 03:00:11,860
I'm okay.

5112
03:00:12,100 --> 03:00:12,940
I'm okay.

5113
03:00:14,180 --> 03:00:15,000
Let's go.

5114
03:00:15,380 --> 03:00:15,940
Yay!

5115
03:00:17,860 --> 03:00:18,960
360 no scope!

5116
03:00:19,160 --> 03:00:19,320
Wow!

5117
03:00:19,940 --> 03:00:21,340
You're doing really well!

5118
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:23,660
Oh, thank you, Gumi!

5119
03:00:24,520 --> 03:00:25,320
I'm like a poker stick!

5120
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:29,040
I can't wait for the voice papers to come through.

5121
03:00:31,340 --> 03:00:32,680
Thank you, Gumi.

5122
03:00:32,780 --> 03:00:34,320
I know I'm doing really well.

5123
03:00:35,400 --> 03:00:35,960
Wow!

5124
03:00:35,960 --> 03:00:36,520
Wow!

5125
03:00:38,860 --> 03:00:42,060
Guys, I'm so...

5126
03:00:43,200 --> 03:00:44,680
I'm what the kids say.

5127
03:00:44,780 --> 03:00:45,200
Pog!

5128
03:00:46,360 --> 03:00:46,940
Ew!

5129
03:00:50,220 --> 03:00:53,000
I learned that on the Tiki Talk yesterday.

5130
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:57,940
You hear about the...

5131
03:00:59,900 --> 03:01:02,620
There's like... I was watching this video about this dad.

5132
03:01:03,100 --> 03:01:04,740
That's like some fucking...

5133
03:01:06,240 --> 03:01:07,820
Skateboarder or some shit.

5134
03:01:08,120 --> 03:01:10,080
Some extreme fucking...

5135
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:10,380
No!

5136
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:11,240
Breakdancer!

5137
03:01:11,440 --> 03:01:11,720
Yeah!

5138
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:15,190
This guy left his family to be a professional breakdancer.

5139
03:01:16,300 --> 03:01:17,400
Oh my god!

5140
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:18,320
Yeah!

5141
03:01:18,880 --> 03:01:19,360
Yeah!

5142
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:22,940
And he like makes really cringy TikToks and shit.

5143
03:01:23,800 --> 03:01:25,400
I was watching like...

5144
03:01:26,980 --> 03:01:31,800
A video like about talking about this fucking dad that was like a professional breakdancer.

5145
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:35,880
And he left his family and his career because he wanted to be a professional breakdancer.

5146
03:01:35,960 --> 03:01:37,800
And he's like 50 or some shit.

5147
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:39,380
Where do I go?

5148
03:01:39,380 --> 03:01:39,880
It sounds like you.

5149
03:01:42,540 --> 03:01:43,900
Oh, they got a divorce?

5150
03:01:44,180 --> 03:01:45,080
Oh my god!

5151
03:01:45,080 --> 03:01:46,860
They got a divorce just to be a professional.

5152
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:47,360
Of course.

5153
03:01:50,020 --> 03:01:50,860
But not really.

5154
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:51,740
I'm about to be us, baby!

5155
03:01:52,180 --> 03:01:54,240
I'm gonna be a professional breakdancer!

5156
03:01:55,460 --> 03:01:55,980
Yeah!

5157
03:01:56,180 --> 03:01:57,560
Wait, his daughter lied?

5158
03:01:59,400 --> 03:02:00,820
Mom, can I stay with you?

5159
03:02:00,900 --> 03:02:01,920
Dad is being cringy.

5160
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:04,760
Wait, but...

5161
03:02:04,760 --> 03:02:06,700
The daughter lied for...

5162
03:02:06,700 --> 03:02:08,340
He paid millions in the divorce?

5163
03:02:08,680 --> 03:02:09,680
Oh my god!

5164
03:02:09,780 --> 03:02:10,640
But didn't he...

5165
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:13,700
Okay, but like did he want a divorce because of breakdancing?

5166
03:02:13,700 --> 03:02:15,340
Or because of...

5167
03:02:15,340 --> 03:02:16,940
Or just because he hates his wife?

5168
03:02:17,240 --> 03:02:17,460
Like...

5169
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:21,680
Like which one?

5170
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:22,300
Is it...

5171
03:02:22,300 --> 03:02:23,840
Does he hate his wife?

5172
03:02:23,980 --> 03:02:26,520
Or like he wanted to be a breakdancer?

5173
03:02:28,340 --> 03:02:30,180
He was a great dad?

5174
03:02:32,140 --> 03:02:34,860
He was and only took breakdance 20 years.

5175
03:02:34,860 --> 03:02:36,060
That is just a hobby.

5176
03:02:36,260 --> 03:02:37,740
The wife was bad.

5177
03:02:38,040 --> 03:02:38,440
Okay.

5178
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:38,920
Damn!

5179
03:02:39,120 --> 03:02:41,720
I can't believe the daughter lied on the internet on TikTok.

5180
03:02:43,700 --> 03:02:45,360
I don't know what's going on, man.

5181
03:02:47,380 --> 03:02:48,940
The mom divorced him?

5182
03:02:54,520 --> 03:02:55,320
No way!

5183
03:02:55,360 --> 03:02:56,500
I can't believe the daughter lied.

5184
03:02:58,320 --> 03:02:59,980
I can't believe it.

5185
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:05,300
I can't believe he lied on the internet.

5186
03:03:05,720 --> 03:03:07,600
I'm so fucking like...

5187
03:03:08,440 --> 03:03:10,940
I'm so like registering the fact that...

5188
03:03:10,940 --> 03:03:13,160
The daughter lied about his break...

5189
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:14,200
Her breakdancing dad.

5190
03:03:15,360 --> 03:03:17,520
I don't know what's going on.

5191
03:03:17,540 --> 03:03:19,400
I haven't seen the breakdancing dad, man.

5192
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:19,860
Bro!

5193
03:03:20,080 --> 03:03:22,320
He was on like America's Got Talent.

5194
03:03:23,500 --> 03:03:26,180
I don't know if he actually was on America's Got Talent.

5195
03:03:26,740 --> 03:03:28,360
He invented its nest!

5196
03:03:28,820 --> 03:03:29,720
Keep your eyes on it!

5197
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:31,740
But he apparently breakdanced professionally.

5198
03:03:35,640 --> 03:03:36,220
Whoa!

5199
03:03:36,480 --> 03:03:37,020
Bird!

5200
03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:38,080
That was close!

5201
03:03:39,420 --> 03:03:43,070
I am freaking out!

5202
03:03:43,070 --> 03:03:43,250
I am freaking out!

5203
03:03:43,250 --> 03:03:43,390
I am freaking out!

5204
03:03:46,170 --> 03:03:47,030
Oh my god!

5205
03:03:47,030 --> 03:03:47,150
Whoa!

5206
03:03:51,500 --> 03:03:53,560
Once again, we're running out of real estate!

5207
03:03:53,780 --> 03:03:55,280
I can't believe it.

5208
03:03:55,280 --> 03:03:57,080
People lie on TikTok like that?

5209
03:03:57,140 --> 03:03:59,020
I'm so registering the fact that...

5210
03:03:59,620 --> 03:04:00,960
breakdancing dad was never...

5211
03:04:01,620 --> 03:04:03,300
breakdancing dad story was a lie.

5212
03:04:04,080 --> 03:04:05,760
He's a really good breakdancer.

5213
03:04:05,760 --> 03:04:06,500
You should look him up.

5214
03:04:07,340 --> 03:04:10,020
I'm not going to look up breakdancing dad, man.

5215
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:10,460
Why not?

5216
03:04:10,640 --> 03:04:11,720
He's a good...

5217
03:04:11,720 --> 03:04:13,560
He won like trophies!

5218
03:04:17,690 --> 03:04:19,930
You just don't like dads in general.

5219
03:04:22,170 --> 03:04:23,170
Are you talking to me?

5220
03:04:23,390 --> 03:04:25,090
You don't like fun dads.

5221
03:04:25,630 --> 03:04:28,130
I took hip hop dance classes in college!

5222
03:04:28,550 --> 03:04:31,030
You just don't like fun dads.

5223
03:04:32,410 --> 03:04:33,410
You're right.

5224
03:04:34,330 --> 03:04:37,150
Because I think they're overcompensating for something.

5225
03:04:43,850 --> 03:04:45,630
It's not actual fun.

5226
03:04:45,630 --> 03:04:47,170
It's fake fun though.

5227
03:04:47,170 --> 03:04:48,290
IT'S FUN!

5228
03:04:48,790 --> 03:04:50,910
EVERYBODY ENJOYS DOKI, DAD!

5229
03:04:52,790 --> 03:04:53,690
Not everyone.

5230
03:04:57,190 --> 03:04:58,970
That's why this marriage will never work.

5231
03:04:59,030 --> 03:05:00,490
You don't appreciate fun, dad.

5232
03:05:03,390 --> 03:05:05,890
I think that's why I wanted a divorce in the first place.

5233
03:05:06,130 --> 03:05:07,970
You used to like fun, dad.

5234
03:05:08,270 --> 03:05:09,410
You used to love it.

5235
03:05:09,450 --> 03:05:09,870
What happened?

5236
03:05:11,850 --> 03:05:14,030
I don't think I ever liked fun, dad.

5237
03:05:14,050 --> 03:05:16,170
You only became a dad after we had a kid, man.

5238
03:05:16,310 --> 03:05:17,470
You used to love fun, dad.

5239
03:05:18,410 --> 03:05:19,610
It was so fun.

5240
03:05:22,250 --> 03:05:23,130
There's... nothing.

5241
03:05:26,090 --> 03:05:28,850
We just like... where do we go?

5242
03:05:29,150 --> 03:05:29,590
Oh.

5243
03:05:30,810 --> 03:05:32,290
We can just stand in the center.

5244
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:38,030
I like how we just move like a little bit.

5245
03:05:41,570 --> 03:05:44,890
We don't have to like move too far, which is nice.

5246
03:05:45,610 --> 03:05:48,290
I think they really wanted us to stress out this game.

5247
03:05:50,150 --> 03:05:51,090
We did it.

5248
03:05:54,850 --> 03:05:55,450
Yay!

5249
03:05:58,650 --> 03:06:00,950
Luigi wins by doing nothing!

5250
03:06:03,810 --> 03:06:04,410
Oh.

5251
03:06:04,430 --> 03:06:04,910
Oh.

5252
03:06:06,410 --> 03:06:07,530
Down we go.

5253
03:06:07,710 --> 03:06:09,530
Oh, it's like the... the Disneyland.

5254
03:06:09,770 --> 03:06:10,750
Like the... the...

5255
03:06:11,530 --> 03:06:13,370
The Tower... Hotel Tower thing.

5256
03:06:13,910 --> 03:06:14,710
Oh, dude.

5257
03:06:14,830 --> 03:06:15,810
I hated that ride.

5258
03:06:16,050 --> 03:06:17,290
I never got to ride it.

5259
03:06:17,330 --> 03:06:18,030
I was too young.

5260
03:06:20,230 --> 03:06:23,350
I haven't been to Disneyland in so fucking long.

5261
03:06:24,050 --> 03:06:24,870
You wanna go?

5262
03:06:25,350 --> 03:06:26,430
Which one, though?

5263
03:06:26,930 --> 03:06:29,270
I'm thinking... I'm thinking...

5264
03:06:30,050 --> 03:06:31,450
We can get a...

5265
03:06:33,510 --> 03:06:34,070
Well...

5266
03:06:34,070 --> 03:06:35,290
Which one's the best one?

5267
03:06:35,290 --> 03:06:36,250
Wanna go to Tokyo Sea?

5268
03:06:36,930 --> 03:06:39,850
Okay, I actually... I'm not... I don't know.

5269
03:06:39,850 --> 03:06:44,190
Cause like Tokyo Sea... I've actually been to Tokyo Sea, but I was like 10 or some shit.

5270
03:06:44,570 --> 03:06:45,450
What is happening?

5271
03:06:46,090 --> 03:06:46,890
We're rewinding.

5272
03:06:46,990 --> 03:06:47,590
We can do this again.

5273
03:06:48,070 --> 03:06:51,770
I like how we're just having a casual conversation while we do this.

5274
03:06:52,810 --> 03:06:54,610
Well, when did you wanna take our trip together?

5275
03:06:55,510 --> 03:06:56,110
Oh, yeah.

5276
03:06:56,230 --> 03:06:58,330
We're supposed to... Are we going to Japan together?

5277
03:06:58,590 --> 03:06:59,410
Or wait... where?

5278
03:06:59,490 --> 03:06:59,730
Do you wanna go?

5279
03:07:00,230 --> 03:07:00,850
I'm down.

5280
03:07:01,590 --> 03:07:02,470
Do you wanna go to...

5281
03:07:02,470 --> 03:07:04,150
I wanna do Universal...

5282
03:07:04,150 --> 03:07:04,910
No, well, I'll message you a date.

5283
03:07:05,430 --> 03:07:07,870
I wanna do like Universal Studios, though.

5284
03:07:07,870 --> 03:07:11,470
I feel like I've never been to... I've only been to Universal Studios once.

5285
03:07:11,630 --> 03:07:11,870
Oh!

5286
03:07:11,870 --> 03:07:12,810
And it was for like...

5287
03:07:12,810 --> 03:07:13,570
Oh!

5288
03:07:13,710 --> 03:07:15,070
I think we have to do the clock, right?

5289
03:07:15,870 --> 03:07:17,130
Yeah, we have to destroy the clock.

5290
03:07:17,610 --> 03:07:18,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5291
03:07:18,610 --> 03:07:19,330
I got this one.

5292
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:29,000
Okay, last one.

5293
03:07:31,580 --> 03:07:32,360
The floor...

5294
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:36,740
Okay, to be fair, this night in general cost a lot of money for no... for...

5295
03:07:36,740 --> 03:07:37,300
Oh, no!

5296
03:07:37,340 --> 03:07:38,540
Yeah, it definitely does.

5297
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:39,080
Yeah.

5298
03:07:42,600 --> 03:07:43,400
They're like...

5299
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:45,300
They're like so...

5300
03:07:45,300 --> 03:07:46,140
I wanna...

5301
03:07:46,140 --> 03:07:47,660
Okay, you know what I really want?

5302
03:07:47,740 --> 03:07:49,920
I wanna do Universal Japan in Halloween.

5303
03:07:50,420 --> 03:07:51,640
Cause like I heard...

5304
03:07:51,640 --> 03:07:52,040
Oh!

5305
03:07:52,060 --> 03:07:52,460
Halloween...

5306
03:07:52,460 --> 03:07:54,220
No, I actually wanted to go in October.

5307
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:58,360
I hear like Halloween Universal Japan is like really, really fun.

5308
03:07:59,320 --> 03:07:59,800
Really?

5309
03:07:59,960 --> 03:08:00,320
Yeah.

5310
03:08:00,400 --> 03:08:01,240
With all the ghosties?

5311
03:08:01,400 --> 03:08:02,080
Yeah, cause like...

5312
03:08:02,080 --> 03:08:04,400
It's like super creative, like their costumes.

5313
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:06,900
Wait, do I have to help you?

5314
03:08:08,540 --> 03:08:09,380
Oh, we have to...

5315
03:08:09,380 --> 03:08:11,520
Are you doing this?

5316
03:08:12,520 --> 03:08:13,000
Yeah!

5317
03:08:13,160 --> 03:08:13,920
Oh, I think...

5318
03:08:14,820 --> 03:08:15,320
You...

5319
03:08:15,320 --> 03:08:15,640
You...

5320
03:08:15,640 --> 03:08:15,900
Um...

5321
03:08:19,460 --> 03:08:21,900
You go on the side and then...

5322
03:08:21,900 --> 03:08:22,940
And then...

5323
03:08:22,940 --> 03:08:26,060
And then we go here and you have to do that.

5324
03:08:27,980 --> 03:08:28,940
Where's the other one?

5325
03:08:29,020 --> 03:08:29,600
Oh, there it is.

5326
03:08:30,640 --> 03:08:32,920
I'm very slowly going down.

5327
03:08:35,020 --> 03:08:36,060
Up behind you.

5328
03:08:39,820 --> 03:08:40,820
And then...

5329
03:08:40,820 --> 03:08:42,240
Where does this go?

5330
03:08:42,440 --> 03:08:43,320
I already turned it.

5331
03:08:43,320 --> 03:08:44,500
The most I could turn.

5332
03:08:44,520 --> 03:08:45,020
Turn it backwards.

5333
03:08:45,320 --> 03:08:45,840
Oh, there it is.

5334
03:08:45,880 --> 03:08:46,760
There it is to your back.

5335
03:08:48,380 --> 03:08:49,540
No, I don't think so.

5336
03:08:50,680 --> 03:08:51,400
Is it not?

5337
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:52,900
Cause then...

5338
03:08:53,660 --> 03:08:54,220
Bring it.

5339
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:56,380
Oh, no.

5340
03:08:56,600 --> 03:08:56,960
Doki!

5341
03:08:57,220 --> 03:08:57,660
No!

5342
03:08:57,700 --> 03:08:58,540
You win!

5343
03:08:58,720 --> 03:08:59,880
How was I supposed to know?

5344
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:02,380
Cause I was supposed to stay on it!

5345
03:09:02,560 --> 03:09:03,400
Oh, no.

5346
03:09:03,560 --> 03:09:03,960
Okay.

5347
03:09:05,960 --> 03:09:06,400
Hello?

5348
03:09:06,640 --> 03:09:06,860
Hello?

5349
03:09:07,540 --> 03:09:07,980
Hello?

5350
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:09,340
Dude, I hate this slow motion jump.

5351
03:09:09,820 --> 03:09:11,420
I'm gonna fall soon!

5352
03:09:15,860 --> 03:09:16,680
Oh, no.

5353
03:09:17,060 --> 03:09:17,660
Okay.

5354
03:09:17,880 --> 03:09:18,240
Okay.

5355
03:09:19,500 --> 03:09:20,820
Alright, here we go.

5356
03:09:21,240 --> 03:09:22,600
Oh, there it is.

5357
03:09:24,040 --> 03:09:26,180
Oh, I do not have much time left.

5358
03:09:31,520 --> 03:09:33,720
Oh, there's something in front of you.

5359
03:09:34,160 --> 03:09:35,000
I know.

5360
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:35,460
I know.

5361
03:09:35,500 --> 03:09:37,200
The camera keeps automatically turning.

5362
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:38,060
Oh!

5363
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:38,380
Oh!

5364
03:09:41,400 --> 03:09:43,220
Goodbye, cruel world.

5365
03:09:44,240 --> 03:09:44,500
Goodbye.

5366
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:45,160
Goodbye.

5367
03:09:45,260 --> 03:09:45,760
Goodbye.

5368
03:09:46,940 --> 03:09:48,340
Where are you now?

5369
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:49,880
Did it go to this one?

5370
03:09:50,120 --> 03:09:51,240
I don't know.

5371
03:09:52,180 --> 03:09:53,640
Is it this one or this one?

5372
03:09:56,900 --> 03:09:57,700
Is that one?

5373
03:09:58,880 --> 03:10:00,520
Stop turning my camera!

5374
03:10:00,880 --> 03:10:01,900
I'm not doing anything!

5375
03:10:02,580 --> 03:10:03,640
I'm not talking to you!

5376
03:10:08,500 --> 03:10:10,180
Apparently, you went backwards.

5377
03:10:11,080 --> 03:10:11,600
What?

5378
03:10:14,340 --> 03:10:15,240
Apparently, you went backwards.

5379
03:10:18,380 --> 03:10:19,000
Here?

5380
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:21,620
Okay.

5381
03:10:22,240 --> 03:10:24,480
This has to be the right way, yeah?

5382
03:10:26,960 --> 03:10:28,480
Oh, there it is.

5383
03:10:28,940 --> 03:10:30,180
Why can't we...

5384
03:10:30,180 --> 03:10:31,600
I'm so fucking dead.

5385
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:33,500
There's no way I'm gonna live through this.

5386
03:10:35,660 --> 03:10:36,960
There's something below you.

5387
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:39,740
This?

5388
03:10:46,020 --> 03:10:47,500
Is this everything?

5389
03:10:47,780 --> 03:10:48,280
Is this the one?

5390
03:10:48,280 --> 03:10:48,700
Oh, no.

5391
03:10:48,700 --> 03:10:49,580
Where, though?

5392
03:10:50,660 --> 03:10:52,700
Are you really almost there, though?

5393
03:10:53,380 --> 03:10:53,860
Like...

5394
03:10:53,860 --> 03:10:55,460
What happened?

5395
03:10:55,520 --> 03:10:56,580
Why did you do this?

5396
03:10:56,840 --> 03:10:57,260
What happened?

5397
03:11:01,990 --> 03:11:02,470
Goodbye.

5398
03:11:04,830 --> 03:11:05,950
Goodbye, cruel world.

5399
03:11:05,950 --> 03:11:06,690
Where am I?

5400
03:11:07,450 --> 03:11:08,590
I don't know.

5401
03:11:10,350 --> 03:11:11,990
I'm trying to take you somewhere.

5402
03:11:14,690 --> 03:11:15,490
Where are you?

5403
03:11:15,510 --> 03:11:17,430
Do I move you or what?

5404
03:11:20,350 --> 03:11:21,130
There's one here.

5405
03:11:21,250 --> 03:11:21,730
Oh.

There's one here.

5411
03:11:23,570 --> 03:11:24,810
That's not going backwards, is it?

5412
03:11:24,910 --> 03:11:25,450
I don't know.

5413
03:11:25,510 --> 03:11:26,510
I can't tell anymore.

5414
03:11:26,510 --> 03:11:27,430
I feel like it is.

5415
03:11:28,770 --> 03:11:29,770
But maybe it's not.

5416
03:11:31,690 --> 03:11:33,050
I can't tell anymore.

5417
03:11:33,410 --> 03:11:34,170

03:11:37,850 --> 03:11:39,010
Are you going backwards?

5420
03:11:39,210 --> 03:11:39,970

5421
03:11:42,410 --> 03:11:42,810
Okay.

5422
03:11:42,810 --> 03:11:43,650

5423
03:11:43,650 --> 03:11:43,790
No, no, no.

5424
03:11:43,910 --> 03:11:44,270

Are you going backwards?

5434
03:11:57,690 --> 03:11:58,150
I can't tell.

5435
03:11:58,230 --> 03:11:58,690

Why can't we be friends?

5443
03:12:10,470 --> 03:12:12,530
Why can't we be friends?

5444
03:12:13,190 --> 03:12:15,330
Why can't we be friends?

5445
03:12:16,070 --> 03:12:16,730
Is that it?

5446
03:12:16,770 --> 03:12:17,530
Do I jump on the clock?

5447
03:12:18,050 --> 03:12:18,570

Letter number two!

5493
03:15:25,200 --> 03:15:27,940
What else besides love makes couples stay together?

We need people together!

5497
03:15:37,280 --> 03:15:38,400
We don't need attraction!

5498
03:15:38,400 --> 03:15:39,600
We're getting divorced!

5499
03:15:40,060 --> 03:15:40,680
Aha!

5500
03:15:41,200 --> 03:15:42,980

5501
03:15:43,280 --> 03:15:46,920
But don't worry, I'll help you find attraction again!

5502
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:49,420

03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:09,780
Oh, it's the snow level!

5506
03:16:10,120 --> 03:16:10,860
I've seen this level!

5507
03:16:10,860 --> 03:16:12,800
I did not think this game was this long!

5508
03:16:13,740 --> 03:16:17,120
I told you it was a 14 plus hour game, what do you mean?

5509
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:21,040
Dude, I thought that's because people try to get like every secret or some shit

5510
03:16:24,540 --> 03:16:27,940
Attraction is like a magnet, but you need both poles!

5511
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:29,140
No sound!

5512
03:16:29,720 --> 03:16:30,720
Plus, minus!

5513
03:16:31,180 --> 03:16:32,120
Cody, man!

5514
03:16:33,880 --> 03:16:35,220
And the plus...

5515
03:16:35,740 --> 03:16:37,900

5516
03:16:37,900 --> 03:16:38,380
Yeah!

5517
03:16:38,380 --> 03:16:38,380
This magnet will help you discover your tracks!

5518
03:16:38,380 --> 03:16:39,280
I'm the plus!

5519
03:16:42,860 --> 03:16:45,300
One is plus, one is minus!

5520
03:16:45,440 --> 03:16:45,560
Oh!

5521
03:16:45,720 --> 03:16:47,060
That's not how it works!

5522
03:16:47,420 --> 03:16:49,820
Red is minus, blue is plus, who gets blue?

5523
03:16:50,520 --> 03:16:51,040
Me!

5524
03:16:53,080 --> 03:16:53,600

5526
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:55,860

I got...

5529
03:16:58,020 --> 03:17:09,560
And when a negative plus a negative comes together, it makes a positive Okay, so we don't have two negatives, we have a positive and a negative The negative comes together Yes!

5530
03:17:10,600 --> 03:17:13,120
This is where we had our first skiing trip together!

5531
03:17:13,220 --> 03:17:13,960
Oh my god!

That's us!

5535
03:17:18,480 --> 03:17:20,200
Oh, it's a snow globe!

5536
03:17:20,640 --> 03:17:23,840
We're stuck inside that snow globe we bought there!

5537
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:28,420
Get to the top of the mountain to receive your next piece of the letter!

5538
03:17:29,260 --> 03:17:31,960
Yeah, what if we freeze to death trying to get there?

5539
03:17:32,500 --> 03:17:32,900
Hahaha!

5540
03:17:32,900 --> 03:17:38,100

5541
03:17:38,320 --> 03:17:39,500
Oh god!

5542
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:40,680
Eww!

5543
03:17:40,960 --> 03:17:43,300
Is he like humping the snow globe?

5544
03:17:43,980 --> 03:17:46,460
He did not need to do that!

5545
03:17:47,480 --> 03:17:59,460
I'm gonna break the snow globe the moment we get out It's compromised That was so freaking gross That was pretty gross, yeah Guys, how much do we have left from this game?

Different colors attract, same colors repel!

03:19:03,470 --> 03:19:04,690
I can't do anything here!

5566
03:19:04,690 --> 03:19:05,410

Why are you swimming?

5585
03:19:40,350 --> 03:19:41,330
It launched me off?

5586
03:19:41,530 --> 03:19:43,490
And then it like...

5587
03:19:43,490 --> 03:19:44,290
Wait...

5588
03:19:44,290 --> 03:19:45,090
What?

5589
03:19:46,470 --> 03:19:46,950
Okay...

5590
03:19:46,950 --> 03:19:49,150
Alright, and then I push this?

5591
03:19:50,050 --> 03:19:51,230
Can I not push this?

5592
03:19:51,450 --> 03:19:52,330
What am I supposed to do?

5593
03:19:53,730 --> 03:19:55,170
Let me... let me...

5594
03:19:55,710 --> 03:19:57,410
Oh, you do it!

5595
03:19:57,450 --> 03:19:58,230
But it was red!

5596
03:19:58,470 --> 03:19:59,530
Okay, you do it.

5597
03:20:00,590 --> 03:20:01,150
Cause...

5598
03:20:01,910 --> 03:20:02,470
Oh!

5599
03:20:02,890 --> 03:20:04,250
Yeah, but I'm red!

5600
03:20:04,470 --> 03:20:06,010
And now I do this.

5601
03:20:06,350 --> 03:20:07,330
Don't leave me here, Koji!

5602
03:20:07,650 --> 03:20:08,610
Help me get over!

5603
03:20:09,830 --> 03:20:10,730
Let me go!

5604
03:20:13,250 --> 03:20:14,250
I'm doing it!

5605
03:20:15,910 --> 03:20:16,470
Teamwork!

5606
03:20:16,830 --> 03:20:17,390
Teamwork!

5607
03:20:20,050 --> 03:20:21,670
Oh, cause it's blue!

5608
03:20:22,490 --> 03:20:23,770
And I'm red!

5609
03:20:23,910 --> 03:20:24,770
And with magnets!

5610
03:20:24,770 --> 03:20:25,670
You're opposite to Tron!

5611
03:20:25,830 --> 03:20:26,390
Hahaha!

5612
03:20:27,390 --> 03:20:29,330
I just learned how to use magnets!

5613
03:20:29,330 --> 03:20:29,870
Hahaha!

5614
03:20:35,070 --> 03:20:38,030
I just learned how to use magnets, guys!

5615
03:20:38,490 --> 03:20:38,930
I'm red!

5616
03:20:39,150 --> 03:20:41,190
See, every day I learn something new!

5617
03:20:42,010 --> 03:20:43,030
Every day!

5618
03:20:44,390 --> 03:20:44,950
Hey!

5619
03:20:44,950 --> 03:20:47,290
Remember our first Christmas with Rose?

5620
03:20:47,510 --> 03:20:49,730
You mean when all the Christmas trees were sold out?

5621
03:20:50,010 --> 03:20:50,290
Yeah!

5622
03:20:50,470 --> 03:20:54,110
And we snuck into the woods and cut down one ourselves?

5623
03:20:54,530 --> 03:20:55,830
Guys, how do they work?

5624
03:20:56,210 --> 03:20:58,770
When you have two of the same color...

5625
03:20:58,770 --> 03:21:00,290
You push them away!

5626
03:21:00,670 --> 03:21:02,350
But when you have like...

5627
03:21:03,150 --> 03:21:04,430
Opposite colors...

5628
03:21:04,430 --> 03:21:05,790
You pull them in!

5629
03:21:07,250 --> 03:21:10,550
You should have taught me this instead of me figuring it out.

5630
03:21:11,150 --> 03:21:13,570
So, opposites attract...

5631
03:21:13,570 --> 03:21:16,590
But if you have two of the same kind, you repel each other.

5632
03:21:16,770 --> 03:21:17,190
Yeah!

5633
03:21:19,290 --> 03:21:19,930
Oh!

5634
03:21:22,270 --> 03:21:23,470
So it'll push me up.

5635
03:21:24,810 --> 03:21:26,090
Cause opposite...

5636
03:21:26,090 --> 03:21:27,630
Same thing, people!

5637
03:21:27,910 --> 03:21:29,050
Push each other away!

5638
03:21:30,270 --> 03:21:30,670
Okay.

5639
03:21:33,270 --> 03:21:34,590
It's me cause I'm red.

5640
03:21:37,650 --> 03:21:38,610
And what do you do?

5641
03:21:39,190 --> 03:21:42,170
I need you to pull that to... I need you to pull that, innit?

5642
03:21:42,770 --> 03:21:44,150
I feel like you have to pull it.

5643
03:21:44,750 --> 03:21:45,630
I can't pull it.

5644
03:21:48,090 --> 03:21:49,130
Yeah, I don't reach it.

5645
03:21:50,770 --> 03:21:51,450
Oh, wait.

5646
03:21:51,510 --> 03:21:52,470
There's something else here.

5647
03:21:52,570 --> 03:21:53,310
Oh, there's something else here.

5648
03:21:53,330 --> 03:21:54,090
You're supposed to pull that.

5649
03:21:58,460 --> 03:21:58,900
Phew!

5650
03:22:07,420 --> 03:22:09,020
I think you have to pull it all the way.

5651
03:22:09,880 --> 03:22:10,840
I'm pretty sure.

5652
03:22:12,600 --> 03:22:13,220
Well, stop!

5653
03:22:14,980 --> 03:22:15,720
There we go.

5654
03:22:18,100 --> 03:22:18,980
And then...

5655
03:22:20,120 --> 03:22:21,700
And then I pull this.

5656
03:22:22,080 --> 03:22:22,520
And then I pull this.

5657
03:22:22,520 --> 03:22:22,520
See?

5658
03:22:22,700 --> 03:22:23,440
I pull this.

5659
03:22:24,360 --> 03:22:25,740
And then you go in.

5660
03:22:25,820 --> 03:22:26,960
And then I launch you.

5661
03:22:27,380 --> 03:22:27,820
And then you go in.

5662
03:22:29,340 --> 03:22:29,780
Oh...

5663
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:30,540
Oh...

5664
03:22:31,580 --> 03:22:32,720
And then you do that.

5665
03:22:35,160 --> 03:22:36,940
Yeah, and then I can pull it now.

5666
03:22:37,700 --> 03:22:39,180
Yeah, oh I can't, I can't!

5667
03:22:39,280 --> 03:22:40,060
You gotta push it more!

5668
03:22:40,960 --> 03:22:42,980
Just barely got on my hands.

5669
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:44,960
I got it.

5670
03:22:46,540 --> 03:22:47,040
Yay!

5671
03:22:51,920 --> 03:22:53,540
I'm coming over my love.

5672
03:22:58,140 --> 03:22:59,220
That's fucked up.

5673
03:23:01,020 --> 03:23:02,660
That's fucked up, man.

5674
03:23:04,500 --> 03:23:06,780
I gave you my love.

5675
03:23:08,400 --> 03:23:12,400
And the very next day, you gave it up.

5676
03:23:12,480 --> 03:23:13,380
You pushed me away.

5677
03:23:25,050 --> 03:23:26,030
Don't leave me.

5678
03:23:26,110 --> 03:23:29,310
You can't run away from this handsome hunk of a man forever.

5679
03:23:29,850 --> 03:23:31,670
I'm gonna die.

5680
03:23:33,130 --> 03:23:33,650
I

5681
03:23:39,720 --> 03:23:41,380
am a catch, okay?

5682
03:23:45,720 --> 03:23:47,300
I am a 10 out of 10.

5683
03:23:49,200 --> 03:23:52,060
Dude, any guy who tells you that...

5684
03:23:52,060 --> 03:23:52,800
I'm a catch!

5685
03:23:52,960 --> 03:23:54,260
I'm a 10 out of 10!

5686
03:23:54,840 --> 03:23:56,220
Now I'm different!

5687
03:23:57,060 --> 03:23:58,240
Okay, that's awesome.

5688
03:23:59,780 --> 03:24:01,280
There, here, I gave it to you.

5689
03:24:01,380 --> 03:24:02,740
I literally gave you the thing.

5690
03:24:03,260 --> 03:24:04,860
Why are you pulling that way?

5691
03:24:05,020 --> 03:24:06,400
Because you need to get the blue.

5692
03:24:06,840 --> 03:24:07,720
To get closer.

5693
03:24:07,940 --> 03:24:08,620
Oh, wait.

5694
03:24:08,980 --> 03:24:10,100
Yeah, you need to get the...

5695
03:24:10,100 --> 03:24:10,760
Oh, wait.

5696
03:24:10,840 --> 03:24:11,560
Blue repels.

5697
03:24:17,230 --> 03:24:18,150
No.

5698
03:24:19,250 --> 03:24:19,710
No.

5699
03:24:20,190 --> 03:24:21,050
No.

5700
03:24:22,210 --> 03:24:22,670
Yeah!

5701
03:24:25,110 --> 03:24:27,070
I learned magnets.

5702
03:24:34,110 --> 03:24:36,190
I know how magnet works.

5703
03:24:36,530 --> 03:24:37,230
Yay!

5704
03:24:42,910 --> 03:24:43,850
Oh, your thingy.

5705
03:24:45,050 --> 03:24:45,450
Lo...

5706
03:24:46,350 --> 03:24:47,150
Your thingy.

5707
03:24:48,370 --> 03:24:49,110
Go for it.

5708
03:24:52,630 --> 03:24:53,730
Why did you do that?

5709
03:24:55,630 --> 03:24:56,650
Why did you do that?

5710
03:24:56,690 --> 03:24:57,170
I'm helping!

5711
03:24:57,510 --> 03:24:57,670
Go!

5712
03:24:57,890 --> 03:24:59,110
Wait, why did you get back?

5713
03:24:59,570 --> 03:25:00,850
How did you get back there?

5714
03:25:01,050 --> 03:25:01,110
Because I...

5715
03:25:01,670 --> 03:25:03,930
I was trying to launch off of it!

5716
03:25:04,390 --> 03:25:05,110
Alright, go, go.

5717
03:25:05,230 --> 03:25:05,970
Go for your blue.

5718
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:11,740
There you go.

5719
03:25:11,960 --> 03:25:12,340
See?

5720
03:25:13,740 --> 03:25:15,140
Chat, am I a 10 out of 10?

5721
03:25:15,360 --> 03:25:17,560
Any wife would be happy to have me.

5722
03:25:21,280 --> 03:25:21,720
Right?

5723
03:25:21,900 --> 03:25:24,200
Anybody would want me as a husband.

5724
03:25:25,260 --> 03:25:25,700
See?

5725
03:25:25,840 --> 03:25:27,200
Look at all the people that said yes.

5726
03:25:27,280 --> 03:25:29,940
And look at all the people I ignored that said something else.

5727
03:25:33,520 --> 03:25:34,880
That said something else.

5728
03:25:36,060 --> 03:25:38,520
Clearly, the other thing did not matter.

5729
03:25:42,320 --> 03:25:45,660
Damn, 100% people thought I am a cat.

5730
03:25:53,260 --> 03:25:54,220
Fast travel.

5731
03:25:55,840 --> 03:25:56,540
What's this?

5732
03:25:59,280 --> 03:25:59,920
I'm helping.

5733
03:26:00,140 --> 03:26:00,440
I'm helping.

5734
03:26:05,280 --> 03:26:06,740
Wait, how do we...

5735
03:26:06,740 --> 03:26:08,340
We have to do...

5736
03:26:08,340 --> 03:26:09,300
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

5737
03:26:09,400 --> 03:26:09,900
Wait, wait.

5738
03:26:10,940 --> 03:26:12,220
Oh, where am I?

5739
03:26:12,400 --> 03:26:14,400
You have to go to that... you see that other blue thing?

5740
03:26:14,540 --> 03:26:14,940
You have to go there.

5741
03:26:15,240 --> 03:26:16,400
There's a blue thing over there.

5742
03:26:16,600 --> 03:26:17,580
Wait, where are you?

5743
03:26:17,600 --> 03:26:18,300
Where did I go?

5744
03:26:18,440 --> 03:26:18,660
You went backwards.

5745
03:26:18,820 --> 03:26:19,700
You literally went back.

5746
03:26:19,700 --> 03:26:19,940
I know!

5747
03:26:20,000 --> 03:26:20,940
I got launched!

5748
03:26:20,960 --> 03:26:21,720
I got launched!

5749
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:24,080
Wait, if you die, maybe it'll respawn next to me.

5750
03:26:24,560 --> 03:26:25,260
You think so?

5751
03:26:26,120 --> 03:26:26,480
Yeah.

5752
03:26:26,520 --> 03:26:27,100
Oh, my leg.

5753
03:26:27,280 --> 03:26:27,600
Oh.

5754
03:26:28,180 --> 03:26:28,720
Yeah, see?

5755
03:26:28,960 --> 03:26:29,620
You're next to it.

5756
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:33,360
Yo!

5757
03:26:37,270 --> 03:26:37,630
Wait...

5758
03:26:42,600 --> 03:26:42,960
No.

5759
03:26:42,960 --> 03:26:43,160
No.

5760
03:26:43,400 --> 03:26:43,840
Go!

5761
03:26:44,080 --> 03:26:44,740
You have to.

5762
03:26:44,740 --> 03:26:46,440
There's a blue thing over there on the other side.

5763
03:26:47,340 --> 03:26:48,160
What do you mean, no?

5764
03:26:48,980 --> 03:26:49,420
No.

5765
03:26:49,560 --> 03:26:50,180
What do you mean?

5766
03:26:51,260 --> 03:26:51,700
Off.

5767
03:26:53,660 --> 03:26:54,540
Get off.

5768
03:26:54,580 --> 03:26:55,060
I did.

5769
03:26:55,120 --> 03:26:55,420
Get off.

5770
03:26:56,720 --> 03:26:57,160
No.

5771
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:58,320
What do you mean?

5772
03:26:58,360 --> 03:26:59,260
That's how you do it.

5773
03:26:59,740 --> 03:27:00,180
Wait...

5774
03:27:00,920 --> 03:27:01,600
Do I...

5775
03:27:01,600 --> 03:27:03,220
The blue thing repels, no?

5776
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:04,980
I repel it!

5777
03:27:05,200 --> 03:27:06,400
No, you have to...

5778
03:27:06,860 --> 03:27:09,560
You get on and then you get to that blue.

5779
03:27:11,020 --> 03:27:12,060
Is that blue over there?

5780
03:27:13,400 --> 03:27:16,600
Yeah, and then I repel the blue because I repel it.

5781
03:27:16,780 --> 03:27:17,660
Wait, huh?

5782
03:27:17,940 --> 03:27:19,120
Then how do we do this?

5783
03:27:21,900 --> 03:27:22,740
Then you do it.

5784
03:27:27,550 --> 03:27:28,550
Yeah, you do it.

5785
03:27:28,890 --> 03:27:29,870
How do you do it?

5786
03:27:32,210 --> 03:27:33,950
Do I have to pull this over here?

5787
03:27:34,630 --> 03:27:35,590
I guess so.

5788
03:27:36,050 --> 03:27:36,450
Oh!

5789
03:27:36,750 --> 03:27:38,430
Oh, what if I like bring it to you and then you...

5790
03:27:38,430 --> 03:27:39,430
Push it a little.

5791
03:27:39,530 --> 03:27:40,090
Push it a little.

5792
03:27:40,190 --> 03:27:42,490
Yeah, I bring it to you and then you do...

5793
03:27:42,490 --> 03:27:43,390
Oh, my God.

5794
03:27:43,430 --> 03:27:44,310
We're so smart.

5795
03:27:44,310 --> 03:27:44,530
Why?

5796
03:27:44,530 --> 03:27:45,350
We know magnets.

5797
03:27:45,350 --> 03:27:49,070
Why did you keep telling me to go get pulled by blue when you know...

5798
03:27:49,070 --> 03:27:50,430
Why are you jumping?

5799
03:27:53,350 --> 03:27:55,170
I didn't know what that was.

5800
03:27:58,130 --> 03:27:59,950
I thought it was a box.

5801
03:28:02,650 --> 03:28:04,670
I thought it was a box.

5802
03:28:06,770 --> 03:28:07,490
Oh, God.

5803
03:28:07,590 --> 03:28:08,430
I gotta go to sleep.

5804
03:28:08,730 --> 03:28:09,570
I think you're right.

5805
03:28:13,720 --> 03:28:15,760
We're rekindling our love.

5806
03:28:16,240 --> 03:28:17,600
Oh, my God.

5807
03:28:18,080 --> 03:28:19,940
Do I have anything in my pants?

5808
03:28:20,760 --> 03:28:21,440
What?

5809
03:28:23,100 --> 03:28:24,740
We're rekindling our love.

5810
03:28:26,220 --> 03:28:28,980
You know what we'll fix our marriage?

5811
03:28:29,680 --> 03:28:30,800
Another kid.

5812
03:28:31,360 --> 03:28:33,520
Maybe we just... we just...

5813
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:35,520
We just have two little kids.

5814
03:28:37,800 --> 03:28:41,080
I feel like that's actually how some married couples think.

5815
03:28:41,120 --> 03:28:41,360
Dude, I feel like that's actually how some married couples think.

5816
03:28:42,540 --> 03:28:43,020
Dude, I'm done.

5817
03:28:43,020 --> 03:28:44,580
I'm fucking... I hate it here.

5818
03:28:44,680 --> 03:28:45,540
Another child will fix this.

5819
03:28:45,780 --> 03:28:47,820
We just need another baby in the house.

5820
03:28:48,160 --> 03:28:50,080
Was it this cozy when we were here?

5821
03:28:50,340 --> 03:28:52,780
I miss when your boobies were bigger...

5822
03:28:52,780 --> 03:28:58,560
...because we had a baby.garbling Can I be out of here for a while?

5823
03:28:59,360 --> 03:29:06,960
Dude, I read a post like that recently and I was like, Am I the asshole... for wanting my wife to be pregnant... because her boobs are bigger?

5824
03:29:06,960 --> 03:29:07,220
Oh!

5825
03:29:11,500 --> 03:29:12,240
That's real?

5826
03:29:14,440 --> 03:29:16,120
I'm pretty sure it's a meet up pose.

5827
03:29:16,340 --> 03:29:19,060
Yeah, no man would fucking write that.

5828
03:29:19,280 --> 03:29:20,080
Oh my god.

5829
03:29:21,020 --> 03:29:21,500
Bro.

5830
03:29:22,940 --> 03:29:25,360
There's no way a guy actually wrote that.

5831
03:29:25,400 --> 03:29:26,080
That's so...

5832
03:29:26,900 --> 03:29:28,020
There's a guy who...

5833
03:29:28,020 --> 03:29:29,740
It has to be a joke.

5834
03:29:29,780 --> 03:29:30,860
It was a real life story.

5835
03:29:31,080 --> 03:29:35,440
But the guy was like, My name is Jarvan, and boy do I love breast milk.

5836
03:29:39,540 --> 03:29:41,080
No, but that's a thing.

5837
03:29:41,080 --> 03:29:42,980
That's a real fetish.

5838
03:29:43,300 --> 03:29:44,900
Yeah, but like...

5839
03:29:44,900 --> 03:29:47,160
Then people probably...

5840
03:29:47,160 --> 03:29:49,200
Some men do feel that way.

5841
03:29:49,600 --> 03:29:50,280
Yeah.

5842
03:29:52,880 --> 03:29:53,820
You understand.

5843
03:29:54,900 --> 03:29:55,580
What?

5844
03:30:00,480 --> 03:30:04,480
Some people are ass men, and some people are boobs.

5845
03:30:05,040 --> 03:30:06,840
Some people like butts, and some like boobs.

5846
03:30:06,960 --> 03:30:07,900
I understand.

5847
03:30:10,320 --> 03:30:11,360
Are we going in the right way?

5848
03:30:11,480 --> 03:30:11,600
Okay.

5849
03:30:12,160 --> 03:30:13,340
Pull the fucking door, man.

5850
03:30:13,820 --> 03:30:14,420
Yeah, sorry.

5851
03:30:14,500 --> 03:30:14,920
Mommy?

5852
03:30:15,040 --> 03:30:15,280
Sorry.

5853
03:30:18,120 --> 03:30:20,720
So I was like, did you read my bio?

5854
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:22,180
Yeah, I get it.

5855
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:23,980
Pussy in bio.

5856
03:30:25,340 --> 03:30:26,540
Some people like...

5857
03:30:26,540 --> 03:30:29,400
Some people are the front, some people are the backs.

5858
03:30:35,060 --> 03:30:36,480
And sometimes both.

5859
03:30:36,960 --> 03:30:37,920
Where are they?

5860
03:30:38,320 --> 03:30:40,800
This town used to be like your relationship.

5861
03:30:41,860 --> 03:30:43,040
Alive and fun!

5862
03:30:47,190 --> 03:30:48,530
But look at it now.

5863
03:30:49,110 --> 03:30:49,590
Silent.

5864
03:30:49,890 --> 03:30:50,370
Dead.

5865
03:30:50,730 --> 03:30:51,210
Frozen.

5866
03:30:52,350 --> 03:30:54,690
You need to wake it up from its winter sleep!

5867
03:30:55,110 --> 03:30:55,930
How are we gonna do that?

5868
03:30:55,950 --> 03:30:58,890
You like it smaller up top.

5869
03:31:00,110 --> 03:31:04,830
So I was like, Please do not conflate breast appreciators with milk enthusiasts.

5870
03:31:05,530 --> 03:31:09,010
The two are completely different schools of thought.

5871
03:31:10,430 --> 03:31:11,150
What?

5872
03:31:11,610 --> 03:31:12,330
What?

5873
03:31:17,550 --> 03:31:19,030
What did they say?

5874
03:31:19,330 --> 03:31:19,910
What did they say?

5875
03:31:19,910 --> 03:31:19,930
What did they say?

5876
03:31:19,930 --> 03:31:24,010
They're like, Please don't group us together with those who like milk.

5877
03:31:24,710 --> 03:31:29,030
Please don't group us together with those who like milk.

5878
03:31:29,530 --> 03:31:31,790
Oh my god.

5879
03:31:35,590 --> 03:31:36,130
Bro.

5880
03:31:37,750 --> 03:31:39,510
And some people like that.

5881
03:31:41,270 --> 03:31:43,710
The ancient ninja rivalry.

5882
03:31:44,690 --> 03:31:45,050
The ancient ninja rivalry.

5883
03:31:45,050 --> 03:31:45,710
Wait, is it me?

5884
03:31:46,910 --> 03:31:47,630
I don't know.

5885
03:31:47,650 --> 03:31:48,550
Am I supposed to push it?

5886
03:31:48,750 --> 03:31:49,730
Oh, I think you pull it.

5887
03:31:50,010 --> 03:31:50,990
Yeah, it's me.

5888
03:31:52,250 --> 03:31:53,870
Then you have to press this button.

5889
03:31:55,970 --> 03:31:56,670
Wait, what?

5890
03:32:01,030 --> 03:32:02,390
This opens something.

5891
03:32:03,590 --> 03:32:04,130
Right?

5892
03:32:04,130 --> 03:32:05,730
It lifts this rock up.

5893
03:32:06,030 --> 03:32:08,270
But like, what does that do?

5894
03:32:12,490 --> 03:32:12,930
Confused.

5895
03:32:20,750 --> 03:32:22,250
What are you supposed to do here?

5896
03:32:22,670 --> 03:32:23,110
Oh!

5897
03:32:23,710 --> 03:32:24,150
Wait.

5898
03:32:24,350 --> 03:32:25,530
Am I supposed to watch him?

5899
03:32:29,640 --> 03:32:31,300
Oh, can I pull it even further?

5900
03:32:32,560 --> 03:32:33,240
Wait, hold on.

5901
03:32:33,300 --> 03:32:33,480
Hold on.

5902
03:32:33,520 --> 03:32:33,680
Hold on.

5903
03:32:33,760 --> 03:32:35,620
I can pull it?

5904
03:32:37,720 --> 03:32:39,300
Oh, I can pull it further!

5905
03:32:39,560 --> 03:32:39,940
Oh!

5906
03:32:41,280 --> 03:32:42,520
Why do you keep doing this?

5907
03:32:42,520 --> 03:32:44,400
Why do you keep doing this?

5908
03:32:44,560 --> 03:32:45,080
Why?

5909
03:32:46,480 --> 03:32:47,900
Why do you keep doing this?

5910
03:32:50,880 --> 03:32:51,400
Oh!

5911
03:32:51,800 --> 03:32:51,860
Oh!

5912
03:32:54,720 --> 03:32:55,560
I'm learning.

5913
03:32:57,700 --> 03:32:58,800
Oh, it goes nothing.

5914
03:33:00,120 --> 03:33:02,600
More and more I learn every day.

5915
03:33:03,380 --> 03:33:03,900
Oh!

5916
03:33:05,240 --> 03:33:07,480
I learn more and more every day.

5917
03:33:07,940 --> 03:33:09,240
Why do you keep doing this?

5918
03:33:09,380 --> 03:33:09,900
What do you mean?

5919
03:33:10,500 --> 03:33:11,260
Why do you keep doing this?

5920
03:33:11,260 --> 03:33:11,840
What do you mean?

5921
03:33:12,900 --> 03:33:14,240
Oh my god, they're alive!

5922
03:33:16,260 --> 03:33:16,920
Killed it.

5923
03:33:17,100 --> 03:33:17,300
Yay!

5924
03:33:18,220 --> 03:33:22,300
Oh my god, they're like the Ice King from Adventure Time.

5925
03:33:22,620 --> 03:33:23,520
They're like mini Ice Kings.

5926
03:33:23,520 --> 03:33:25,260
It reminded me of the guys from...

5927
03:33:25,260 --> 03:33:27,100
The island from Mario Sunshine.

5928
03:33:27,560 --> 03:33:28,200
Oh yeah!

5929
03:33:28,380 --> 03:33:29,660
But with clothes on!

5930
03:33:30,380 --> 03:33:31,380
We did good.

5931
03:33:31,880 --> 03:33:32,800
We did this.

5932
03:33:34,240 --> 03:33:35,660
Oh my god, they're alive!

5933
03:33:36,280 --> 03:33:38,000
It looks like how I remember it now.

5934
03:33:39,100 --> 03:33:41,260
You remember it like this, you freak?

5935
03:33:41,580 --> 03:33:42,320
That's you.

5936
03:33:42,460 --> 03:33:43,040
Oh my god, look at her back!

5937
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:44,220
You're calling yourself a freak.

5938
03:33:44,460 --> 03:33:45,740
Oh, that's so cute!

5939
03:33:47,160 --> 03:33:48,960
Why are you calling yourself a freak?

5940
03:33:50,800 --> 03:33:51,320
Hey!

5941
03:33:51,500 --> 03:33:52,840
We gotta open the door.

5942
03:33:54,020 --> 03:33:55,080
We gotta open the door!

5943
03:33:56,020 --> 03:33:56,980
I'm on my own.

5944
03:34:06,010 --> 03:34:06,530
Oh!

5945
03:34:07,530 --> 03:34:08,450
That's so pretty.

5946
03:34:09,390 --> 03:34:10,890
Can you host another poll?

5947
03:34:11,410 --> 03:34:11,930
Why?

5948
03:34:13,810 --> 03:34:14,630
What's the poll?

5949
03:34:16,090 --> 03:34:17,450
What was the poll you did last time?

5950
03:34:17,630 --> 03:34:19,890
The reason for the divorce.

5951
03:34:20,410 --> 03:34:21,210
No, no.

5952
03:34:21,290 --> 03:34:24,690
The other poll was like, am I a 10 out of 10 catch?

5953
03:34:25,590 --> 03:34:26,550
You know, I would...

5954
03:34:26,550 --> 03:34:27,310
Yeah, I'm gonna write that.

5955
03:34:27,490 --> 03:34:28,350
Am I...

5956
03:34:30,370 --> 03:34:32,250
Hustle and bustle when we were here.

5957
03:34:35,070 --> 03:34:39,790
Am I a 10 out of 10...

5958
03:34:39,790 --> 03:34:41,390
Am I a 10 out of 10...

5959
03:34:41,390 --> 03:34:42,770
Oh shit, I'm big again.

5960
03:34:43,250 --> 03:34:46,070
Am I a 10 out of 10...

5961
03:34:46,090 --> 03:34:46,290
Catch of a husband.

5962
03:34:46,290 --> 03:34:46,810
Am I a 10 out of 10...

5963
03:34:47,950 --> 03:34:49,870
Catch of a husband.

5964
03:34:52,010 --> 03:34:52,850
There we go.

5965
03:34:55,030 --> 03:34:55,730
There we go.

5966
03:34:55,770 --> 03:34:56,390
That's my poll.

5967
03:34:56,510 --> 03:34:58,150
I gotta fix myself because I'm big again.

5968
03:34:58,310 --> 03:35:00,910
And I accidentally went big.

5969
03:35:01,670 --> 03:35:02,950
Give me a sec.

5970
03:35:04,410 --> 03:35:05,750
No, I'm big.

5971
03:35:10,740 --> 03:35:11,640
What the fuck?

5972
03:35:11,800 --> 03:35:12,480
What did I do?

5973
03:35:13,240 --> 03:35:14,640
Oh my god, what did I do?

5974
03:35:16,420 --> 03:35:16,900
Okay.

5975
03:35:17,420 --> 03:35:18,160
There we go.

5976
03:35:19,200 --> 03:35:19,680
Big.

5977
03:35:20,040 --> 03:35:21,180
Not big anymore.

5978
03:35:21,720 --> 03:35:23,140
Hold on, I need to vote real quick.

5979
03:35:23,640 --> 03:35:24,580
Wait, what do you mean?

5980
03:35:25,660 --> 03:35:26,980
Why do you need a vote?

5981
03:35:28,340 --> 03:35:29,780
Cause we're the one that's...

5982
03:35:29,780 --> 03:35:31,500
I'm literally married to you.

5983
03:35:34,740 --> 03:35:35,220
What?

5984
03:35:36,580 --> 03:35:37,800
Why do you need a vote?

5985
03:35:37,860 --> 03:35:38,780
I don't understand.

5986
03:35:42,620 --> 03:35:44,480
Look, see?

5987
03:35:44,660 --> 03:35:46,160
More people think I'm a catch!

5988
03:35:46,640 --> 03:35:48,780
And then the others' opinions don't matter.

5989
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:55,720
So it's 100% right!

5990
03:35:57,200 --> 03:35:58,440
It's 100%!

5991
03:36:00,160 --> 03:36:01,020
I knew it.

5992
03:36:01,040 --> 03:36:01,580
I knew it.

5993
03:36:01,620 --> 03:36:02,600
I knew it.

5994
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:04,160
I knew it.

5995
03:36:06,960 --> 03:36:10,260
I think this is how men's egos inflate.

5996
03:36:10,520 --> 03:36:11,460
What do you mean?

5997
03:36:13,060 --> 03:36:14,660
I just saw it in real time.

5998
03:36:15,060 --> 03:36:16,720
What the fuck do you mean?

5999
03:36:16,820 --> 03:36:18,220
I'm a 10 out of 10!

6000
03:36:18,340 --> 03:36:18,780
I'm a 10 out of 10!

6001
03:36:19,860 --> 03:36:20,540
What?

6002
03:36:20,800 --> 03:36:23,900
You're the worst husband I've ever been married to.

6003
03:36:23,920 --> 03:36:24,200
I'm the worst?

6004
03:36:24,200 --> 03:36:26,100
You had multiple husbands?

6005
03:36:27,100 --> 03:36:29,700
I thought you had multiple wives, not husbands.

6006
03:36:30,440 --> 03:36:31,140
Hey man.

6007
03:36:31,400 --> 03:36:31,660
Damn!

6008
03:36:31,740 --> 03:36:34,040
Have you seen 707 from Mystic Messenger?

6009
03:36:34,420 --> 03:36:35,100
Damn!

6010
03:36:35,400 --> 03:36:36,380
You know what?

6011
03:36:37,560 --> 03:36:40,820
This is exactly why I'm getting a divorce.

6012
03:36:41,160 --> 03:36:46,700
I'm gonna find somebody that's gonna appreciate me as a husband.

6013
03:36:47,080 --> 03:36:48,200
I'm gonna find somebody that's gonna appreciate me as a husband.

6014
03:36:48,200 --> 03:36:48,780
I'm gonna find somebody that's gonna appreciate me as a husband.

6015
03:36:48,780 --> 03:36:50,180
What do I do here?

6016
03:36:50,600 --> 03:36:51,180
I don't know.

6017
03:36:51,420 --> 03:36:53,720
What am I throwing?

6018
03:36:54,560 --> 03:36:55,140
This?

6019
03:36:56,460 --> 03:36:58,340
Oh, I'm giving you magnets!

6020
03:37:00,200 --> 03:37:00,940
Take it.

6021
03:37:06,210 --> 03:37:07,230
Did you fall?

6022
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:11,500
What are you doing?

6023
03:37:13,300 --> 03:37:17,380
You see, my new wife is gonna figure this out faster.

6024
03:37:21,060 --> 03:37:22,020
What are you doing?

6025
03:37:23,440 --> 03:37:25,720
I'm not doing puzzles for us anymore.

6026
03:37:26,600 --> 03:37:27,260
What are you doing?

6027
03:37:27,260 --> 03:37:29,260
I'm not doing puzzles for us anymore.

6028
03:37:33,340 --> 03:37:34,980
It's fucked up.

6029
03:37:35,100 --> 03:37:36,060
What the fuck?

6030
03:37:36,720 --> 03:37:39,620
You do puzzles by yourself now.

6031
03:37:39,820 --> 03:37:40,860
What are you doing?

6032
03:37:41,140 --> 03:37:43,020
Go fucking get the magnet!

6033
03:37:46,160 --> 03:37:48,800
You can leave when we're people again.

6034
03:37:49,280 --> 03:37:49,580
I'm coming!

6035
03:37:49,840 --> 03:37:50,660
I don't wanna fall!

6036
03:37:56,680 --> 03:37:57,800
There ya go.

6037
03:37:57,980 --> 03:37:58,920
You're welcome.

6038
03:38:00,400 --> 03:38:01,400
You're lucky.

6039
03:38:01,980 --> 03:38:04,120
You're lucky I don't hold grudges.

6040
03:38:06,860 --> 03:38:09,400
I'm getting like actual war flashbacks.

6041
03:38:13,800 --> 03:38:15,080
Fun dad!

6042
03:38:15,120 --> 03:38:16,080
Fun dad!

6043
03:38:16,360 --> 03:38:17,100
Fun dad!

6044
03:38:19,400 --> 03:38:20,840
Fun dad's here!

6045
03:38:21,940 --> 03:38:23,180
Oh god.

6046
03:38:23,340 --> 03:38:25,580
I think I did all my stuff.

6047
03:38:25,600 --> 03:38:27,440
Fun dad!

6048
03:38:27,800 --> 03:38:28,600
Fun dad!

6049
03:38:28,920 --> 03:38:29,960
Fun dad!

6050
03:38:30,660 --> 03:38:31,840
Oh god.

6051
03:38:32,220 --> 03:38:35,540
I just had a PTSD moment.

6052
03:38:36,020 --> 03:38:37,140
What hours?

6053
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:41,420
I think I need to cut my hair.

6054
03:38:42,100 --> 03:38:42,860
I think I need to cut my hair.

6055
03:38:43,560 --> 03:38:45,320
I think I need to cut my hair.

6056
03:38:45,780 --> 03:38:46,300
Hours!

6057
03:38:46,300 --> 03:38:49,580
Where do we go from here?

6058
03:38:49,620 --> 03:38:50,220
That was...

6059
03:38:50,220 --> 03:38:50,680
Woah!

6060
03:38:52,540 --> 03:38:53,360
It's so beautiful!

6061
03:38:54,580 --> 03:38:55,340
Woah!

6062
03:38:55,480 --> 03:38:55,580
It's so beautiful!

6063
03:38:55,580 --> 03:38:56,380
Let's go to the other tower.

6064
03:39:01,320 --> 03:39:02,460
Did you cut your hair?

6065
03:39:04,100 --> 03:39:05,480
Are you pulling a Mulan?

6066
03:39:09,180 --> 03:39:09,700
Kubi?

6067
03:39:10,820 --> 03:39:11,340
Kubi?

6068
03:39:14,060 --> 03:39:14,980
Kubi, you okay?

6069
03:39:17,660 --> 03:39:20,200
Guys, I don't know what's gonna happen.

6070
03:39:20,540 --> 03:39:21,400
Was it me?

6071
03:39:21,740 --> 03:39:23,020
No, it can't be me.

6072
03:39:25,980 --> 03:39:27,700
I can never be the issue.

6073
03:39:27,980 --> 03:39:29,900
I can never be the issue.

6074
03:39:29,900 --> 03:39:31,780
I can never be the issue.

6075
03:39:32,940 --> 03:39:33,440
Kubi!

6076
03:39:34,420 --> 03:39:35,480
Kubi, I need help!

6077
03:39:36,280 --> 03:39:37,920
Kubi, I'm on the other side!

6078
03:39:40,420 --> 03:39:41,700
Where are you, Kubi?

6079
03:39:41,740 --> 03:39:42,780
Get on the owl!

6080
03:39:43,920 --> 03:39:45,960
I just cut off three locks of my hair.

6081
03:39:46,480 --> 03:39:47,280
Oh no!

6082
03:39:47,760 --> 03:39:48,700
What happened?

6083
03:39:48,780 --> 03:39:49,240
What happened?

6084
03:39:51,360 --> 03:39:51,960
I'm gonna get you!

6085
03:39:51,960 --> 03:39:52,320
We're over.

6086
03:39:52,620 --> 03:39:53,200
Did you...

6087
03:39:53,200 --> 03:39:56,400
Did you overdose on the fun?

6088
03:39:57,080 --> 03:39:58,820
Did you just have too much fun?

6089
03:39:59,080 --> 03:39:59,560
I understand.

6090
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:02,480
I don't think...

6091
03:40:02,480 --> 03:40:03,200
I understand.

6092
03:40:03,640 --> 03:40:05,760
Get on the owl and go to the other side.

6093
03:40:06,300 --> 03:40:09,300
I'm on the other side of the tower.

6094
03:40:09,620 --> 03:40:11,860
Like really other side.

6095
03:40:14,620 --> 03:40:15,740
Oh, hey Snowball.

6096
03:40:15,980 --> 03:40:17,480
Oh, I'm gonna get ya!

6097
03:40:19,240 --> 03:40:21,540
I think you're back to being wife number four.

6098
03:40:21,780 --> 03:40:22,180
What?

6099
03:40:22,300 --> 03:40:24,320
I was always wife number four!

6100
03:40:24,600 --> 03:40:25,180
What about husband?

6101
03:40:25,180 --> 03:40:26,980
You got promoted to wife number two.

6102
03:40:27,000 --> 03:40:27,440
Do you know what?

6103
03:40:27,660 --> 03:40:29,280
Now you're wife number five.

6104
03:40:29,580 --> 03:40:30,060
What?

6105
03:40:30,460 --> 03:40:31,900
I think I need to get a new one.

6106
03:40:32,640 --> 03:40:33,640
What did I do?

6107
03:40:34,680 --> 03:40:35,880
Say that again.

6108
03:40:36,560 --> 03:40:37,520
Say that again.

6109
03:40:38,980 --> 03:40:39,600
Say it again.

6110
03:40:41,380 --> 03:40:42,560
Say that again.

6111
03:40:42,920 --> 03:40:43,960
Say that again.

6112
03:40:45,900 --> 03:40:46,380
Bullseye!

6113
03:40:50,780 --> 03:40:53,160
Gonna be back in my wife spot right now.

6114
03:40:53,560 --> 03:40:55,140
Gonna be back in my wife spot right now.

6115
03:40:58,180 --> 03:41:00,380
Okay, for both of this we need...

6116
03:41:00,380 --> 03:41:01,640
We need to do the puzzle!

6117
03:41:04,200 --> 03:41:05,260
Do the puzzle!

6118
03:41:06,260 --> 03:41:08,420
You can't hold on to that Snowball forever.

6119
03:41:09,040 --> 03:41:09,420
You can't hold on to that Snowball forever.

6120
03:41:09,580 --> 03:41:10,960
Alright, I can grab more.

6121
03:41:12,380 --> 03:41:13,300
Come on!

6122
03:41:13,600 --> 03:41:15,280
Oh my god, do the puzzle!

6123
03:41:19,200 --> 03:41:20,740
I got homing missiles.

6124
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:22,120
This is fucked up.

6125
03:41:22,460 --> 03:41:23,680
This is fucked up.

6126
03:41:25,660 --> 03:41:28,110
This is fucked up.

6127
03:41:28,290 --> 03:41:29,730
Then, what do I have to do?

6128
03:41:30,690 --> 03:41:31,550
Watch out, man.

6129
03:41:31,650 --> 03:41:31,950
Oh, here.

6130
03:41:32,110 --> 03:41:33,790
I couldn't tell where the walls were.

6131
03:41:34,930 --> 03:41:36,050
Oh, here.

6132
03:41:36,050 --> 03:41:36,050
I couldn't tell where the walls were.

6133
03:41:36,050 --> 03:41:36,610
What do you mean?

6134
03:41:36,950 --> 03:41:37,370
Okay, here we go.

6135
03:41:37,630 --> 03:41:39,630
I can hold on to this for just a little bit.

6136
03:41:41,030 --> 03:41:42,290
I don't think you have to pull.

6137
03:41:42,390 --> 03:41:42,690
Let go.

6138
03:41:42,970 --> 03:41:43,010
I don't think you have to pull.

6139
03:41:43,010 --> 03:41:43,010
Let go.

6140
03:41:44,330 --> 03:41:45,150
Wait, wait, wait.

6141
03:41:45,150 --> 03:41:46,510
Okay, now let go.

6142
03:41:49,770 --> 03:41:50,530
Wait, what?

6143
03:41:52,130 --> 03:41:52,650
Wait.

6144
03:41:53,010 --> 03:41:53,530
What?

6145
03:41:54,870 --> 03:41:55,390
Stay?

6146
03:41:55,990 --> 03:41:56,510
Yeah.

6147
03:41:59,690 --> 03:42:01,170
Oh, you don't let go.

6148
03:42:01,390 --> 03:42:01,990
Oh, whoops.

6149
03:42:02,470 --> 03:42:03,490
Did you do that again?

6150
03:42:06,330 --> 03:42:08,090
Fun Dad, Fun Dad.

6151
03:42:08,350 --> 03:42:08,570
Yay!

6152
03:42:10,590 --> 03:42:11,810
Fun Dad's here.

6153
03:42:12,930 --> 03:42:14,850
Fun Dad, Fun Dad.

6154
03:42:15,030 --> 03:42:15,230
Yay!

6155
03:42:16,490 --> 03:42:17,730
I'm so fun.

6156
03:42:18,850 --> 03:42:19,450
Oh!

6157
03:42:20,290 --> 03:42:21,850
What did you...

6158
03:42:21,850 --> 03:42:23,710
I have to do that again.

6159
03:42:25,890 --> 03:42:26,710
Don't worry.

6160
03:42:26,830 --> 03:42:28,370
That means more time for Fun Dad.

6161
03:42:29,690 --> 03:42:30,590
Come on.

6162
03:42:30,610 --> 03:42:32,050
Get me out of here.

6163
03:42:32,050 --> 03:42:33,350
More time to spend for Fun Dad.

6164
03:42:33,610 --> 03:42:34,210
Yay!

6165
03:42:36,190 --> 03:42:37,390
Oh god.

6166
03:42:39,250 --> 03:42:41,150
Oh my god.

6167
03:42:41,150 --> 03:42:41,810
Yay!

6168
03:42:42,970 --> 03:42:45,150
Longer time for Fun Dad.

6169
03:42:45,870 --> 03:42:46,670
Yay!

6170
03:42:49,750 --> 03:42:50,030
Yay!

6171
03:42:51,150 --> 03:42:51,950
Woo!

6172
03:42:53,590 --> 03:42:54,830
Okay, I'm ready.

6173
03:42:55,070 --> 03:42:56,770
You have to take me to the other side again.

6174
03:43:02,710 --> 03:43:03,510
Nice.

6175
03:43:04,790 --> 03:43:05,370
I'm here.

6176
03:43:09,370 --> 03:43:10,170
Yeah!

6177
03:43:17,060 --> 03:43:18,660
Oh god.

6178
03:43:19,060 --> 03:43:19,960
We did it!

6179
03:43:20,980 --> 03:43:21,780
Pancakes!

6180
03:43:22,880 --> 03:43:24,220
Oh my god, there's food!

6181
03:43:25,080 --> 03:43:27,400
Can I borrow like five dollars?

6182
03:43:27,980 --> 03:43:28,420
No!

6183
03:43:29,240 --> 03:43:29,940
You're right.

6184
03:43:30,060 --> 03:43:31,340
We share a bank account.

6185
03:43:32,000 --> 03:43:33,460
I already cut you off.

6186
03:43:34,200 --> 03:43:34,800
It's okay.

6187
03:43:35,340 --> 03:43:36,640
We share a bank account.

6188
03:43:36,960 --> 03:43:39,700
I moved all the funds back to my personal bank account.

6189
03:43:39,940 --> 03:43:41,220
Wait, that's so fucked up.

6190
03:43:41,240 --> 03:43:42,320
You can't do that legally.

6191
03:43:45,380 --> 03:43:46,500
We're getting divorced.

6192
03:43:46,800 --> 03:43:47,460
We can.

6193
03:43:47,840 --> 03:43:50,380
We're not divorced yet.

6194
03:43:50,380 --> 03:43:51,020
We're not divorced yet.

6195
03:43:52,720 --> 03:43:54,500
I don't trust you with fun.

6196
03:43:55,320 --> 03:43:57,260
What do you mean you don't trust my fun?

6197
03:43:57,260 --> 03:43:57,860
I'm so fun.

6198
03:43:58,120 --> 03:43:59,940
We have to head to the other tower.

6199
03:44:01,080 --> 03:44:02,180
I'm at the other tower?

6200
03:44:03,940 --> 03:44:04,440
Hiya!

6201
03:44:04,500 --> 03:44:05,800
We gotta free these guys.

6202
03:44:06,960 --> 03:44:08,020
Free these nuts.

6203
03:44:08,960 --> 03:44:09,580
Oh wait.

6204
03:44:11,460 --> 03:44:12,400
Get over here.

6205
03:44:15,220 --> 03:44:16,900
Fun Dad's waiting for the fun.

6206
03:44:18,700 --> 03:44:19,280
Bad move.

6207
03:44:19,340 --> 03:44:22,300
Yeah, if you do that, my lawyer has a case for me.

6208
03:44:27,420 --> 03:44:28,840
We signed a prenup.

6209
03:44:29,020 --> 03:44:29,800
No, I did.

6210
03:44:29,900 --> 03:44:31,200
I forgot to sign it.

6211
03:44:31,240 --> 03:44:33,460
You have to go to the other...

6212
03:44:33,460 --> 03:44:33,720
Oh wait, no.

6213
03:44:33,780 --> 03:44:34,460
I have to.

6214
03:44:35,480 --> 03:44:36,040
Wait, no.

6215
03:44:36,060 --> 03:44:37,180
You have to because of tracks.

6216
03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:37,680
No.

6217
03:44:44,360 --> 03:44:44,680
Alright.

6218
03:44:45,060 --> 03:44:45,920
What do you have to do now?

6219
03:44:46,320 --> 03:44:47,240
You need to turn it.

6220
03:44:49,320 --> 03:44:51,040
I turn, I turn, I turn.

6221
03:44:51,060 --> 03:44:51,860
Wait, wait, wait.

6222
03:44:52,020 --> 03:44:52,900
Keep turning.

6223
03:44:53,100 --> 03:44:53,360
I turn.

6224
03:44:55,980 --> 03:44:56,840
Here I am.

6225
03:44:58,120 --> 03:44:58,900
I'm here now.

6226
03:44:59,160 --> 03:44:59,480
Yay!

6227
03:45:01,480 --> 03:45:02,540
I did it!

6228
03:45:04,020 --> 03:45:04,700
I'm up.

6229
03:45:06,620 --> 03:45:07,420
And then...

6230
03:45:08,540 --> 03:45:08,940
Okay.

6231
03:45:13,900 --> 03:45:15,100
Oh my god, we're so smart.

6232
03:45:15,160 --> 03:45:16,280
This is why we're perfect for each other.

6233
03:45:19,280 --> 03:45:20,300
Do you have to pull this?

6234
03:45:23,580 --> 03:45:25,680
What does it opposite to tracked mean?

6235
03:45:26,580 --> 03:45:28,280
Yeah, so you pull it down.

6236
03:45:28,780 --> 03:45:30,800
Get on the freaking thing!

6237
03:45:33,000 --> 03:45:34,380
Get on the freaking thing!

6238
03:45:36,160 --> 03:45:36,780
Get on the freaking thing!

6239
03:45:36,780 --> 03:45:40,500
I didn't know that was an elevator.

6240
03:45:41,480 --> 03:45:44,440
I didn't know it was an elevator!

6241
03:45:48,120 --> 03:45:50,260
Get on the freaking thing.

6242
03:45:52,720 --> 03:45:53,640
I'm sorry.

6243
03:45:53,640 --> 03:45:54,620
Context clues!

6244
03:45:54,980 --> 03:45:57,560
Where are my explicit context clues?

6245
03:46:02,050 --> 03:46:03,970
Oh, there's a Ferris wheel!

6246
03:46:05,210 --> 03:46:07,150
There's a gondola lift?

6247
03:46:10,610 --> 03:46:11,950
Oh, it's over there!

6248
03:46:12,610 --> 03:46:14,270
We go to the gondola!

6249
03:46:17,090 --> 03:46:18,470
Wow, this guy is huge.

6250
03:46:18,470 --> 03:46:19,290
Woah!

6251
03:46:21,290 --> 03:46:23,110
Wait, I can like make this go fast.

6252
03:46:25,830 --> 03:46:26,690
That's looking right.

6253
03:46:26,770 --> 03:46:26,970
Have fun!

6254
03:46:26,970 --> 03:46:28,210
Dude, I love those rides!

6255
03:46:28,250 --> 03:46:28,670
Fun time!

6256
03:46:28,770 --> 03:46:30,170
I love those rides at a carnival.

6257
03:46:31,070 --> 03:46:31,950
Fun forever!

6258
03:46:34,490 --> 03:46:36,870
That's right, you're all gonna have fun forever!

6259
03:46:38,150 --> 03:46:39,050
What the hell?

6260
03:46:40,810 --> 03:46:41,930
I'm going to the gondola.

6261
03:46:42,150 --> 03:46:43,390
How do you get to the gondola?

6262
03:46:48,000 --> 03:46:48,960
Opposite a track.

6263
03:46:51,060 --> 03:46:52,500
Wait, it won't let me get on.

6264
03:46:52,940 --> 03:46:54,260
How do I... Oh, there it is!

6265
03:46:55,420 --> 03:46:56,360
Are you okay?

6266
03:46:57,540 --> 03:46:58,700
Yeah, that was me stretching.

6267
03:46:59,340 --> 03:47:01,260
I'm heading... I'm getting there.

6268
03:47:01,340 --> 03:47:02,580
Don't worry, the gondola is working.

6269
03:47:04,240 --> 03:47:05,800
It's a Ferris wheel, man.

6270
03:47:06,160 --> 03:47:07,220
No, it's a gondola!

6271
03:47:08,840 --> 03:47:09,280
See?

6272
03:47:12,020 --> 03:47:12,900
And then...

6273
03:47:12,900 --> 03:47:16,500
Why didn't you want to go on the Ferris wheel with me?

6274
03:47:17,440 --> 03:47:18,800
And then we go down there.

6275
03:47:18,800 --> 03:47:20,020
Because you tried to...

6276
03:47:20,020 --> 03:47:21,580
Beat my ass with snowballs.

6277
03:47:22,640 --> 03:47:24,040
You started it!

6278
03:47:25,340 --> 03:47:25,900
What?

6279
03:47:26,120 --> 03:47:26,260
Hey!

6280
03:47:26,560 --> 03:47:27,400
An aquarium!

6281
03:47:28,640 --> 03:47:29,200
What?

6282
03:47:39,100 --> 03:47:41,080
Yeah, that's right, I said it.

6283
03:47:49,150 --> 03:47:50,690
How do we turn this...

6284
03:47:50,690 --> 03:47:51,510
How did you get in?

6285
03:47:51,510 --> 03:47:52,870
Oh, there's how you get in there.

6286
03:47:57,090 --> 03:47:58,070
I'm pushing!

6287
03:47:59,010 --> 03:48:00,190
Why aren't you pushing?

6288
03:48:01,470 --> 03:48:03,310
Is it fun, Dad?

6289
03:48:07,930 --> 03:48:10,150
Dude, the thing is my character won't move.

6290
03:48:10,390 --> 03:48:12,150
Wait, why are you stuck?

6291
03:48:12,630 --> 03:48:13,490
Just kidding.

6292
03:48:14,790 --> 03:48:16,070
I'm moving now.

6293
03:48:16,310 --> 03:48:16,350
I'm moving now.

6294
03:48:16,450 --> 03:48:17,150
I'm moving now.

6295
03:48:20,690 --> 03:48:21,290
Yeah!

6296
03:48:21,290 --> 03:48:23,110
Look, this is a gondola, okay?

6297
03:48:23,570 --> 03:48:23,870
Yeah!

6298
03:48:25,130 --> 03:48:28,310
Those are... oh, so that's a mini gondola.

6299
03:48:30,990 --> 03:48:32,410
It's a mini gondola.

6300
03:48:33,150 --> 03:48:33,750
Yeah!

6301
03:48:34,630 --> 03:48:37,250
Why didn't you want to do the Ferris wheel with me?

6302
03:48:37,410 --> 03:48:38,110
It's romantic.

6303
03:48:39,870 --> 03:48:40,790
It's romantic.

6304
03:48:42,470 --> 03:48:44,490
Get away from me!

6305
03:48:44,770 --> 03:48:46,430
What do you mean, we're husband and wife?

6306
03:48:47,530 --> 03:48:48,950
I wanted a boyfriend.

6307
03:48:50,070 --> 03:48:51,570
Get away from me!

6308
03:48:51,590 --> 03:48:53,310
Give daddy a kiss!

6309
03:48:53,410 --> 03:48:54,050
No!

6310
03:48:54,590 --> 03:48:54,850
No!

6311
03:48:55,370 --> 03:48:55,970
Just no!

6312
03:49:01,250 --> 03:49:03,190
You still like it!

6313
03:49:03,210 --> 03:49:03,650
What happened?

6314
03:49:04,530 --> 03:49:06,050
You still like this!

6315
03:49:09,550 --> 03:49:11,790
I don't want a kiss!

6316
03:49:15,430 --> 03:49:17,090
Run, come here!

6317
03:49:19,730 --> 03:49:23,770
We can fix this marriage if we just give each other a little kiss!

6318
03:49:24,770 --> 03:49:26,670
I don't want a kiss!

6319
03:49:27,110 --> 03:49:28,270
A little kiss!

6320
03:49:28,670 --> 03:49:29,690
But it's a party!

6321
03:49:30,710 --> 03:49:31,450
Come on!

6322
03:49:31,770 --> 03:49:32,930
We can get a bar!

6323
03:49:33,630 --> 03:49:34,550
Oh, shit!

6324
03:49:35,170 --> 03:49:36,350
Oh, look, this hat!

6325
03:49:37,630 --> 03:49:38,750
I'm taking his hat.

6326
03:49:38,890 --> 03:49:39,770
Oh, look at me!

6327
03:49:39,770 --> 03:49:40,450
I have this hat!

6328
03:49:41,090 --> 03:49:42,330
This one fits perfectly!

6329
03:49:42,330 --> 03:49:42,730
Nice hat!

6330
03:49:43,950 --> 03:49:44,670
I have it.

6331
03:49:44,770 --> 03:49:45,350
Look at my hat!

6332
03:49:45,510 --> 03:49:46,790
I'm not compensating for anything.

6333
03:49:48,950 --> 03:49:50,870
I just think it's a really nice hat.

6334
03:49:54,670 --> 03:49:58,110
It's time for another child to fix our marriage.

6335
03:49:58,950 --> 03:49:59,910
I don't...

6336
03:50:00,610 --> 03:50:01,650
Why is this guy...

6337
03:50:01,650 --> 03:50:03,150
Oh my god, look at this guy.

6338
03:50:03,190 --> 03:50:03,670
Why is he T -posing?

6339
03:50:03,890 --> 03:50:04,330
Look at him.

6340
03:50:05,090 --> 03:50:05,850
Oh, look at...

6341
03:50:05,850 --> 03:50:07,610
Oh, we're gonna be bobsledding!

6342
03:50:07,810 --> 03:50:08,350
Hey, Cody!

6343
03:50:08,810 --> 03:50:09,610
Nice hat!

6344
03:50:09,990 --> 03:50:10,890
Oh, yeah!

6345
03:50:11,310 --> 03:50:12,130
Hey, nice hat!

6346
03:50:12,130 --> 03:50:12,970
It's bobsled time!

6347
03:50:18,060 --> 03:50:19,740
That's right, I'm a better button masher.

6348
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:20,300
Oh!

6349
03:50:21,900 --> 03:50:22,460
Oh!

6350
03:50:22,860 --> 03:50:24,960
Can we review the second game?

6351
03:50:27,640 --> 03:50:29,180
Look at me go!

6352
03:50:31,060 --> 03:50:31,620
Yeah!

6353
03:50:31,980 --> 03:50:32,680
I'm winning!

6354
03:50:34,180 --> 03:50:34,980
Dad's winning!

6355
03:50:35,800 --> 03:50:37,480
Because I know how to have fun.

6356
03:50:39,300 --> 03:50:40,280
Look at me go.

6357
03:50:46,900 --> 03:50:48,540
I take a nappy.

6358
03:50:49,040 --> 03:50:49,460
Oh, no!

6359
03:50:49,460 --> 03:50:50,100
I missed it!

6360
03:50:50,800 --> 03:50:51,740
I missed it!

6361
03:50:51,740 --> 03:50:52,040
It's a ride!

6362
03:50:53,460 --> 03:50:57,020
Okay, nice.

6363
03:50:57,660 --> 03:50:58,500
We're going.

6364
03:51:00,300 --> 03:51:02,140
I have racing games experience.

6365
03:51:02,140 --> 03:51:03,080
Where are we?

6366
03:51:03,280 --> 03:51:04,440
We're like in a tunnel.

6367
03:51:05,520 --> 03:51:06,380
It's a tunnel.

6368
03:51:07,980 --> 03:51:10,020
Oh my god, is that fish?

6369
03:51:10,280 --> 03:51:11,160
Oh, we're in a fish now.

6370
03:51:11,940 --> 03:51:13,760
We're in a fucking fish now.

6371
03:51:13,760 --> 03:51:14,220
Eww!

6372
03:51:14,640 --> 03:51:16,420
Did you see the blood in that one?

6373
03:51:16,640 --> 03:51:18,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6374
03:51:20,140 --> 03:51:21,020
That is...

6375
03:51:21,880 --> 03:51:22,700
Oh, I am!

6376
03:51:22,780 --> 03:51:23,580
I'm moving dick!

6377
03:51:25,320 --> 03:51:27,220
Oh, why is it so bloody?

6378
03:51:29,340 --> 03:51:29,780
Hi!

6379
03:51:30,560 --> 03:51:31,420
Is he dead?

6380
03:51:31,580 --> 03:51:32,620
Stop crashing into me, man!

6381
03:51:33,360 --> 03:51:34,260
Is he dead?

6382
03:51:34,400 --> 03:51:35,280
Or is he alive?

6383
03:51:35,720 --> 03:51:36,380
Oh, he's definitely dead.

6384
03:51:36,380 --> 03:51:37,380
Why do you mean is it alive?

6385
03:51:37,740 --> 03:51:38,220
That's a hole.

6386
03:51:38,220 --> 03:51:38,960
Did you see the outside?

6387
03:51:39,540 --> 03:51:40,940
I don't know, maybe he's sleeping.

6388
03:51:43,740 --> 03:51:44,760
He could be sleeping.

6389
03:51:45,800 --> 03:51:46,620
You know that.

6390
03:51:47,600 --> 03:51:48,040
Hibernation.

6391
03:51:48,360 --> 03:51:48,960
Why does he have a hole?

6392
03:51:48,980 --> 03:51:49,860
That's so weird.

6393
03:51:50,000 --> 03:51:51,820
I'm ahead of my screen, but...

6394
03:51:51,820 --> 03:51:53,200
Yeah, I'm gonna see.

6395
03:51:53,260 --> 03:51:54,320
Earlier, I was ahead...

6396
03:51:54,320 --> 03:51:54,500
What?

6397
03:51:55,260 --> 03:51:56,700
No, I'm still ahead.

6398
03:51:56,940 --> 03:51:57,460
I was so scared.

6399
03:51:58,820 --> 03:52:00,600
He's just hibernating like bears.

6400
03:52:00,900 --> 03:52:03,260
Did you know bears don't actually hibernate?

6401
03:52:03,300 --> 03:52:04,080
That's what's just...

6402
03:52:04,080 --> 03:52:04,460
Yeah, I know.

6403
03:52:04,700 --> 03:52:05,480
You knew?

6404
03:52:06,520 --> 03:52:08,980
We made that shit up to tell kids.

6405
03:52:10,000 --> 03:52:11,300
I blame Spongebob.

6406
03:52:12,860 --> 03:52:14,060
I don't believe it.

6407
03:52:15,320 --> 03:52:16,680
I learned that yesterday.

6408
03:52:17,180 --> 03:52:18,460
Bears don't hibernate.

6409
03:52:18,460 --> 03:52:23,280
We did a poll and they voted on who's more dependent on the other.

6410
03:52:24,640 --> 03:52:25,520
You won.

6411
03:52:25,620 --> 03:52:26,060
Congratulations.

6412
03:52:27,260 --> 03:52:28,380
Wait, on your poll?

6413
03:52:29,100 --> 03:52:29,700
Uh-huh.

6414
03:52:33,520 --> 03:52:35,800
It just means I won't make this marriage to work.

6415
03:52:36,080 --> 03:52:38,720
It means I put more effort in trying to fix this marriage.

6416
03:52:38,780 --> 03:52:40,640
No, it means you're more dependent on my pun.

6417
03:52:40,640 --> 03:52:41,060
It means I'm trying.

6418
03:52:42,440 --> 03:52:44,860
He has killed many a surface.

6419
03:52:46,680 --> 03:52:47,480
I did.

6420
03:52:47,900 --> 03:52:48,440
And I did.

6421
03:52:48,440 --> 03:52:49,240
I'm trying to fix him.

6422
03:52:49,320 --> 03:52:51,320
On the day that I uh- No, not water level...

6423
03:52:51,320 --> 03:52:51,720
Water level?

6424
03:52:52,360 --> 03:52:53,860
That looks chilly.

6425
03:52:54,020 --> 03:52:55,920
I don't do well in cold water.

6426
03:52:55,980 --> 03:52:57,480
No, not water level.

6427
03:52:57,900 --> 03:53:00,360
Should we put the water level for next time?

6428
03:53:00,860 --> 03:53:06,400
I don't wanna do water level.

6429
03:53:11,320 --> 03:53:14,140
We have to finish the chapter out.

6430
03:53:14,320 --> 03:53:14,860
No.

6431
03:53:14,860 --> 03:53:17,000
Not the water level.

6432
03:53:18,080 --> 03:53:19,380
Where do I go?

6433
03:53:20,400 --> 03:53:21,600
I'm already lost.

6434
03:53:23,240 --> 03:53:24,520
I have to go to you.

6435
03:53:24,980 --> 03:53:27,140
I'm here.

6436
03:53:31,700 --> 03:53:34,300
I thought everyone loves water levels.

6437
03:53:34,560 --> 03:53:35,880
No, water levels are...

6438
03:53:35,880 --> 03:53:38,920
It's the music that's good, but the gameplay fucking sucks.

6439
03:53:40,020 --> 03:53:41,720
Except the Pokemon games.

6440
03:53:42,500 --> 03:53:44,480
That's not really a water level though.

6441
03:53:45,000 --> 03:53:45,840
I don't know.

6442
03:53:45,980 --> 03:53:50,960
Dude, I kind of miss those old Pokemon games where you could deep dive into the sea.

6443
03:53:51,220 --> 03:53:53,080
Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

6444
03:53:53,480 --> 03:53:55,820
The one where you go to the ruins and stuff.

6445
03:53:58,620 --> 03:53:59,100
Yay!

6446
03:54:04,100 --> 03:54:05,380
Oh, he's angry.

6447
03:54:06,240 --> 03:54:06,980
Oh, he's angry.

6448
03:54:13,060 --> 03:54:17,860
Dude, imagine being this wack ass book where you created these characters and you pretend to talk to them.

6449
03:54:18,300 --> 03:54:19,460
He's just like me in fourth grade.

6450
03:54:19,460 --> 03:54:20,240
He's writing his own story.

6451
03:54:21,220 --> 03:54:24,200
He has no one else to talk to, so he makes up imaginary friends.

6452
03:54:25,080 --> 03:54:26,340
Yeah, just like me in fourth grade.

6453
03:54:28,520 --> 03:54:31,340
Did you also hump snow globes too, like him?

6454
03:54:31,780 --> 03:54:32,160
No.

6455
03:54:34,380 --> 03:54:35,260
But I will!

6456
03:54:35,380 --> 03:54:37,200
I'll say... nope, nevermind, I don't want to say it.

6457
03:54:41,440 --> 03:54:41,960
Okay.

6458
03:54:51,060 --> 03:54:52,340
You hear that?

6459
03:54:52,680 --> 03:54:55,180
Without sweetness, a relationship will die.

6460
03:54:56,460 --> 03:54:57,340
Oh, you say something?

6461
03:54:57,520 --> 03:54:59,180
I was opening a rice cracker.

6462
03:54:59,380 --> 03:55:00,380
Meenie is senbei.

6463
03:55:07,520 --> 03:55:10,800
I don't make some appreciation for working overtime to support the family.

6464
03:55:10,940 --> 03:55:12,780
Right now.

6465
03:55:13,140 --> 03:55:14,800
Well, there was that time when...

6466
03:55:14,800 --> 03:55:16,280
Meenie, thanks for working overtime.

6467
03:55:17,480 --> 03:55:18,880
I did it.

6468
03:55:19,000 --> 03:55:23,520
Turn on the candy production and make the sweetness blow again!

6469
03:55:27,580 --> 03:55:29,280
Hope you packed your toolkit.

6470
03:55:30,680 --> 03:55:31,380
What the hell?

6471
03:55:31,720 --> 03:55:33,480
Damn, why am I so bitter?

6472
03:55:35,260 --> 03:55:35,900
No!

6473
03:55:37,340 --> 03:55:39,000
Water the book!

6474
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:39,500
Fuck!

6475
03:55:42,340 --> 03:55:43,020
Ehhhhhhhhh!

6476
03:55:47,840 --> 03:55:49,980
Oh, there's some fishies!

6477
03:55:51,760 --> 03:55:53,120
There's a leak here!

6478
03:55:53,360 --> 03:55:54,700
We need to fix it somehow!

6479
03:55:54,720 --> 03:55:55,540
How do we fix it?

6480
03:55:56,840 --> 03:55:58,280
Help me with this wrench, Cody!

6481
03:55:58,880 --> 03:56:00,380
How do we fix it?

6482
03:56:02,920 --> 03:56:03,600
Here?

6483
03:56:08,220 --> 03:56:08,720
Wait, what?

6484
03:56:09,600 --> 03:56:11,440
It's turning, it's turning!

6485
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:12,540
That's a big fish!

6486
03:56:12,540 --> 03:56:13,680
What do we do?

6487
03:56:14,820 --> 03:56:16,260
I refuse to be fixed!

6488
03:56:16,860 --> 03:56:17,220
AHHH!

6489
03:56:17,220 --> 03:56:17,580
FISH!

6490
03:56:19,140 --> 03:56:20,680
I was not a fan of that!

6491
03:56:20,860 --> 03:56:21,580
Wait, what do we do?

6492
03:56:24,180 --> 03:56:24,540
Ohhhhhhh!

6493
03:56:28,610 --> 03:56:29,150
Help me!

6494
03:56:29,270 --> 03:56:29,790
Help me!

6495
03:56:29,890 --> 03:56:30,490
Help me!

6496
03:56:30,530 --> 03:56:31,170
Help me, Cody!

6497
03:56:31,470 --> 03:56:31,790
Where are you?

6498
03:56:33,190 --> 03:56:34,210
Wait, where are you?

6499
03:56:34,350 --> 03:56:35,230
Oh, there you are!

6500
03:56:35,450 --> 03:56:36,350
Okay, I get it.

6501
03:56:37,950 --> 03:56:38,310
AHHHHH!

6502
03:56:38,330 --> 03:56:39,010
He's coming!

6503
03:56:40,050 --> 03:56:43,190
Oh, I'm stuck!

6504
03:56:43,330 --> 03:56:43,730
I'm stuck!

6505
03:56:43,810 --> 03:56:44,150
I'm stuck!

6506
03:56:44,250 --> 03:56:44,650
Where am I?

6507
03:56:44,730 --> 03:56:45,150
Where am I?

6508
03:56:45,230 --> 03:56:45,750
Oh, I got it!

6509
03:56:45,830 --> 03:56:46,150
I got it!

6510
03:56:46,530 --> 03:56:48,470
I think I just lost a few years there!

6511
03:56:49,150 --> 03:56:49,990
I got it!

6512
03:56:50,050 --> 03:56:50,590
I got it!

6513
03:56:50,590 --> 03:56:50,890
I'm helping!

6514
03:56:51,070 --> 03:56:51,470
I'm helping!

6515
03:56:51,730 --> 03:56:52,510
Where do we pull it to?

6516
03:56:53,010 --> 03:56:54,210
Where are we pulling it to?

6517
03:56:54,250 --> 03:56:54,490
Here?

6518
03:56:54,830 --> 03:56:57,150
To the... to the... that thing!

6519
03:56:57,250 --> 03:56:57,690
That thing!

6520
03:56:59,230 --> 03:56:59,790
I'm pulling it to you!

6521
03:56:59,790 --> 03:57:00,850
Where are you pulling it to?

6522
03:57:01,170 --> 03:57:02,370
I'm pulling it to you!

6523
03:57:03,110 --> 03:57:04,490
My beautiful wife!

6524
03:57:11,050 --> 03:57:11,490
See?

6525
03:57:11,490 --> 03:57:11,930
See?

6526
03:57:13,850 --> 03:57:15,790
I did my job!

6527
03:57:16,830 --> 03:57:19,330
And then we... where do we push it to?

6528
03:57:19,450 --> 03:57:20,070
Righty tighty!

6529
03:57:20,070 --> 03:57:20,910
Righty tighty!

6530
03:57:20,910 --> 03:57:21,330
Turn it!

6531
03:57:21,470 --> 03:57:21,970
Turn it!

6532
03:57:21,970 --> 03:57:22,650
I'm turning it!

6533
03:57:23,450 --> 03:57:24,870
I'm turning it!

6534
03:57:25,170 --> 03:57:26,610
Are we doing the wrong one?

6535
03:57:26,950 --> 03:57:27,790
I'm scared.

6536
03:57:29,210 --> 03:57:30,230
Is he coming?

6537
03:57:30,630 --> 03:57:31,690
I don't think so.

6538
03:57:32,830 --> 03:57:34,270
Maybe it's the other way.

6539
03:57:35,190 --> 03:57:36,430
Is it the other way?

6540
03:57:37,290 --> 03:57:39,870
Yeah, it was... You pulled the wrong way!

6541
03:57:41,130 --> 03:57:42,130
Righty tighty!

6542
03:57:44,670 --> 03:57:45,530
Alright, nice.

6543
03:57:46,910 --> 03:57:48,130
I'm going to go to the other one.

6544
03:57:49,010 --> 03:57:49,810
I got it.

6545
03:57:51,430 --> 03:57:53,310
It can't eat all of us!

6546
03:57:55,630 --> 03:57:56,830
Why did you let go?

6547
03:57:58,230 --> 03:57:59,790
What do you mean, why did I let go?

6548
03:57:59,830 --> 03:58:00,310
Why did you let go?

6549
03:58:00,470 --> 03:58:00,970
Pull it!

6550
03:58:01,850 --> 03:58:02,290
Please!

6551
03:58:02,290 --> 03:58:03,350
I'm so weak!

6552
03:58:05,550 --> 03:58:09,010
You didn't marry me for my beautiful body!

6553
03:58:10,610 --> 03:58:11,750
Or maybe you did.

6554
03:58:11,830 --> 03:58:12,310
You just...

6555
03:58:12,310 --> 03:58:14,190
Once again, arranged marriage.

6556
03:58:14,290 --> 03:58:15,290
My parents lost to that.

6557
03:58:17,430 --> 03:58:21,910
Yes, but then the more you spent time with me, the more you fell in love with me.

6558
03:58:22,050 --> 03:58:23,490
It's like Beauty and the Beast.

6559
03:58:24,850 --> 03:58:25,670
I'm Beauty.

6560
03:58:26,550 --> 03:58:28,470
Beauty and the Beast.

6561
03:58:28,870 --> 03:58:31,390
We can make it make complete.

6562
03:58:32,050 --> 03:58:32,570
Let's see.

6563
03:58:34,350 --> 03:58:35,650
We did it!

6564
03:58:35,730 --> 03:58:35,990
Yay!

6565
03:58:36,750 --> 03:58:37,790
One more.

6566
03:58:38,690 --> 03:58:39,590
Where did he go?

6567
03:58:40,970 --> 03:58:42,090
Where's the last one?

6568
03:58:43,170 --> 03:58:43,690
Ow!

6569
03:58:44,650 --> 03:58:45,430
I'm dead.

6570
03:58:46,570 --> 03:58:48,130
By the way, I'm alive.

6571
03:58:50,450 --> 03:58:52,250
Wait, where do we... where's the last one?

6572
03:58:53,010 --> 03:58:54,330
But the last one's behind.

6573
03:58:54,790 --> 03:58:55,410
I see it.

6574
03:58:55,430 --> 03:58:55,810
I see it.

6575
03:58:56,250 --> 03:58:56,970
I'm beast.

6576
03:58:57,530 --> 03:58:58,710
I see where it is.

6577
03:58:58,830 --> 03:58:59,590
I'm heading over.

6578
03:59:02,350 --> 03:59:03,810
It's this way behind us.

6579
03:59:04,590 --> 03:59:05,450
Oh my gosh.

6580
03:59:05,790 --> 03:59:06,430
I know.

6581
03:59:06,870 --> 03:59:07,870
I'm just waiting.

6582
03:59:08,730 --> 03:59:09,810
I'm heading over.

6583
03:59:11,770 --> 03:59:12,890
I'm heading over.

6584
03:59:12,890 --> 03:59:13,590
I'm going to go over there.

6585
03:59:14,910 --> 03:59:17,250
To make my life complete.

6586
03:59:20,950 --> 03:59:21,790
Oh shit!

6587
03:59:21,910 --> 03:59:22,410
It's okay.

6588
03:59:23,490 --> 03:59:24,430
It didn't get me.

6589
03:59:26,330 --> 03:59:26,750
Dodged.

6590
03:59:29,550 --> 03:59:29,970
Yeah.

6591
03:59:32,330 --> 03:59:33,470
Gotta go up.

6592
03:59:34,870 --> 03:59:35,610
Bring it up.

6593
03:59:35,630 --> 03:59:36,050
Bring it up.

6594
03:59:36,670 --> 03:59:37,370
Bring it up.

6595
03:59:38,130 --> 03:59:39,270
It's stuck under here.

6596
03:59:39,430 --> 03:59:40,130
Bring it up.

6597
03:59:40,130 --> 03:59:40,610
Bring it up.

6598
03:59:41,450 --> 03:59:41,950
All right.

6599
03:59:42,090 --> 03:59:42,510
Nice.

6600
03:59:46,090 --> 03:59:47,710
Twisty turny.

6601
03:59:47,710 --> 03:59:48,130
Oh my...

6602
03:59:48,130 --> 03:59:49,810
Twisty turny.

6603
03:59:50,890 --> 03:59:51,730
Oh my...

6604
04:00:04,640 --> 04:00:06,000
We fixed it.

6605
04:00:08,460 --> 04:00:09,860
Hey, it's working.

6606
04:00:10,440 --> 04:00:11,780
I fixed it.

6607
04:00:12,100 --> 04:00:13,160
That's yummy.

6608
04:00:13,700 --> 04:00:14,180
Mom.

6609
04:00:15,500 --> 04:00:17,000
Let's find another one.

6610
04:00:17,280 --> 04:00:19,520
I'm going to do one more.

6611
04:00:20,220 --> 04:00:21,280
Two more?

6612
04:00:21,520 --> 04:00:21,740
Two more?

6613
04:00:21,740 --> 04:00:22,260
Two more?

6614
04:00:22,260 --> 04:00:22,780
Two more?

6615
04:00:23,880 --> 04:00:24,280
Wait.

6616
04:00:24,360 --> 04:00:25,240
How do we get out of here?

6617
04:00:26,760 --> 04:00:26,960
Okay.

6618
04:00:28,400 --> 04:00:28,800
Let's go.

6619
04:00:28,800 --> 04:00:28,800
Wait.

6620
04:00:28,900 --> 04:00:29,000
How do we get out of here?

6621
04:00:29,080 --> 04:00:29,600
That's the machine.

6622
04:00:29,860 --> 04:00:30,600
Oh, it's backwards.

6623
04:00:30,780 --> 04:00:31,180
It's backwards.

6624
04:00:31,300 --> 04:00:31,940
Went the wrong way.

6625
04:00:32,800 --> 04:00:33,200
Oh.

6626
04:00:34,000 --> 04:00:34,520
That's right.

6627
04:00:34,560 --> 04:00:35,320
That's why you have me.

6628
04:00:35,420 --> 04:00:36,220
I know where I'm going.

6629
04:00:39,540 --> 04:00:41,520
Somehow you give me the ick more and more.

6630
04:00:41,560 --> 04:00:42,680
Each line you say.

6631
04:00:43,000 --> 04:00:43,860
What do you mean?

6632
04:00:45,100 --> 04:00:47,240
Every line you say gives me the ick.

6633
04:00:47,520 --> 04:00:47,880
What?

6634
04:00:49,540 --> 04:00:52,580
I have tried so hard to help us.

6635
04:00:52,660 --> 04:00:52,780
You know...

6636
04:00:52,780 --> 04:00:55,300
I am trying my hardest.

6637
04:00:55,300 --> 04:00:56,500
Yeah, maybe you should stop trying.

6638
04:00:56,760 --> 04:01:02,020
I am trying my hardest right now, but you don't appreciate me.

6639
04:01:03,320 --> 04:01:05,160
Maybe it's time to give it a break.

6640
04:01:07,840 --> 04:01:08,980
Where do we go?

6641
04:01:09,620 --> 04:01:10,160
Here?

6642
04:01:13,100 --> 04:01:14,720
But we did this, didn't we?

6643
04:01:19,500 --> 04:01:20,860
Maybe this way?

6644
04:01:22,780 --> 04:01:23,500
Oh, it's this way.

6645
04:01:23,660 --> 04:01:24,780
I figured it out.

6646
04:01:26,100 --> 04:01:26,860
It's here.

6647
04:01:28,020 --> 04:01:29,540
It's a swordfish.

6648
04:01:32,740 --> 04:01:33,440
It's here.

6649
04:01:34,900 --> 04:01:35,760
I wait.

6650
04:01:40,440 --> 04:01:41,260
I wait.

6651
04:01:43,440 --> 04:01:44,420
Oh, the fuck?

6652
04:01:44,580 --> 04:01:44,780
Whoa!

6653
04:01:45,580 --> 04:01:47,320
Swim up and down.

6654
04:01:48,140 --> 04:01:49,140
We need to?

6655
04:01:52,840 --> 04:01:54,060
Oh, we have to.

6656
04:01:55,400 --> 04:01:57,380
We have to make sure we don't die to that.

6657
04:01:58,440 --> 04:01:58,920
Okay.

6658
04:01:59,140 --> 04:01:59,560
Oh!

6659
04:02:00,620 --> 04:02:02,740
It's like only one of us makes it through.

6660
04:02:02,780 --> 04:02:03,900
That's all that matters, right?

6661
04:02:04,460 --> 04:02:04,940
Okay.

6662
04:02:04,940 --> 04:02:05,580
Oh, okay.

6663
04:02:05,700 --> 04:02:06,220
Wait, no.

6664
04:02:06,320 --> 04:02:07,420
I meant like me.

6665
04:02:08,720 --> 04:02:09,200
What?

6666
04:02:09,580 --> 04:02:11,100
Yeah, you make it through.

6667
04:02:11,400 --> 04:02:11,540
No, no.

6668
04:02:11,560 --> 04:02:14,620
I meant like I have the privilege to die.

6669
04:02:15,120 --> 04:02:16,200
Okay, your turn.

6670
04:02:20,920 --> 04:02:22,280
Okay, thank you.

6671
04:02:26,480 --> 04:02:27,460
Okay, here we go.

6672
04:02:27,880 --> 04:02:28,700
I'm coming over.

6673
04:02:30,360 --> 04:02:31,900
Doki does have negative Riz.

6674
04:02:31,980 --> 04:02:32,560
I don't know how.

6675
04:02:32,880 --> 04:02:34,520
How do I have negative Riz?

6676
04:02:37,180 --> 04:02:43,740
63% of the majority of people voted that like I'm 10 out of 10.

6677
04:02:45,920 --> 04:02:46,920
Like I don't understand.

6678
04:02:47,060 --> 04:02:47,820
How do we get out of here?

6679
04:02:48,040 --> 04:02:49,140
I'm like stuck in the water.

6680
04:02:49,360 --> 04:02:49,660
Yeah, I think up there.

6681
04:02:51,060 --> 04:02:51,500
What?

6682
04:02:52,940 --> 04:02:53,380
What?

6683
04:02:53,380 --> 04:02:55,300
Oh, I see it.

6684
04:02:55,840 --> 04:02:56,780
I see it.

6685
04:03:00,900 --> 04:03:03,080
At least I don't feel cold because I'm a doll.

6686
04:03:04,460 --> 04:03:04,980
Yay!

6687
04:03:05,260 --> 04:03:06,820
I pressed the wrong button.

6688
04:03:10,060 --> 04:03:11,020
Okay, here we go.

6689
04:03:12,040 --> 04:03:12,940
What the fuck?

6690
04:03:13,880 --> 04:03:15,740
Why do I keep pressing the wrong button?

6691
04:03:16,660 --> 04:03:18,100
Do you need me over there?

6692
04:03:22,860 --> 04:03:23,640
Okay, nice.

6693
04:03:26,300 --> 04:03:26,820
Nice.

6694
04:03:26,940 --> 04:03:27,460
I made it!

6695
04:03:31,400 --> 04:03:31,760
Weeeeee!

6696
04:03:35,210 --> 04:03:35,970
What the hell?

6697
04:03:36,070 --> 04:03:36,250
It's okay.

6698
04:03:36,350 --> 04:03:37,070
I'll show you how it's done.

6699
04:03:37,810 --> 04:03:38,170
Yay!

6700
04:03:39,970 --> 04:03:41,510
Okay, you pressed the wrong button again.

6701
04:03:42,810 --> 04:03:43,590
No, it's okay.

6702
04:03:43,650 --> 04:03:44,850
I learned how to do it.

6703
04:03:45,430 --> 04:03:46,250
Wait, what is that?

6704
04:03:49,230 --> 04:03:50,390
Oh, that's so cool.

6705
04:03:54,130 --> 04:03:54,490
Ow.

6706
04:03:56,850 --> 04:03:57,370
Don't worry.

6707
04:03:57,370 --> 04:03:57,450
Don't worry.

6708
04:03:57,890 --> 04:04:00,150
I'll grab the checkpoint so you can just spawn next to me.

6709
04:04:01,170 --> 04:04:02,090
Oh, thank you.

6710
04:04:02,810 --> 04:04:03,470
Don't worry.

6711
04:04:04,010 --> 04:04:05,230
Your boo's got it.

6712
04:04:08,690 --> 04:04:10,210
Did you just call me?

6713
04:04:10,730 --> 04:04:12,150
Or call yourself my boo?

6714
04:04:17,010 --> 04:04:17,950
That's some mouse.

6715
04:04:20,370 --> 04:04:21,370
What do you mean?

6716
04:04:24,090 --> 04:04:25,050
We're married.

6717
04:04:27,990 --> 04:04:29,010
That's some mouse.

6718
04:04:30,530 --> 04:04:32,450
That is called a dokey riz.

6719
04:04:32,590 --> 04:04:33,750
She liked it, guys.

6720
04:04:34,010 --> 04:04:34,990
I think she liked it.

6721
04:04:37,050 --> 04:04:42,690
I felt like that was equivalent to some random guy at the bar saying, hey, what's up, shawty?

6722
04:04:44,470 --> 04:04:45,750
She liked it, guys.

6723
04:04:48,690 --> 04:04:49,970
What do we do here?

6724
04:04:50,230 --> 04:04:52,550
Oh, you have to push and then I push and then you push.

6725
04:04:54,090 --> 04:04:54,650
Let's go.

6726
04:04:56,290 --> 04:04:57,270
What are you doing, Chris?

6727
04:04:57,370 --> 04:04:58,110
We are.

6728
04:05:02,310 --> 04:05:04,650
Yeah, you miss all the shots you don't shoot.

6729
04:05:04,730 --> 04:05:05,110
Exactly!

6730
04:05:06,290 --> 04:05:08,390
Hey, but sometimes you should shoot your shot.

6731
04:05:08,910 --> 04:05:09,390
Sometimes.

6732
04:05:10,050 --> 04:05:13,930
Like, you have to keep going until it hits.

6733
04:05:15,790 --> 04:05:17,390
Are we supposed to jump up there?

6734
04:05:18,830 --> 04:05:19,790
Up here.

6735
04:05:25,030 --> 04:05:25,510
Wheeeee!

6736
04:05:29,810 --> 04:05:31,390
How do we get back, though?

6737
04:05:34,210 --> 04:05:34,670
Oh.

6738
04:05:34,870 --> 04:05:37,590
Oh, you didn't tell me press X, you can go faster.

6739
04:05:38,870 --> 04:05:39,330
Wheeeee!

6740
04:05:40,550 --> 04:05:42,470
They tell you that at the very beginning.

6741
04:05:42,770 --> 04:05:43,470
Ice race, let's go!

6742
04:05:44,790 --> 04:05:48,330
Okay, green pass through the... complete a lap.

6743
04:05:49,190 --> 04:05:50,070
I got this.

6744
04:05:50,430 --> 04:05:51,410
Chat, watch this.

6745
04:05:53,410 --> 04:05:55,550
But like, if I don't got this, don't watch.

6746
04:05:57,650 --> 04:05:59,110
Here comes the ice race!

6747
04:05:59,250 --> 04:05:59,430
Oh no.

6748
04:05:59,930 --> 04:06:00,590
Oh no.

6749
04:06:00,710 --> 04:06:01,290
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

6750
04:06:02,990 --> 04:06:04,150
What the fuck?

6751
04:06:04,410 --> 04:06:05,130
You can find.

6752
04:06:06,170 --> 04:06:06,830
That's okay.

6753
04:06:07,430 --> 04:06:07,870
Woo!

6754
04:06:10,310 --> 04:06:11,150
That's exactly right.

6755
04:06:13,650 --> 04:06:14,090
Yeah!

6756
04:06:14,090 --> 04:06:15,470
I'm so fucking fast!

6757
04:06:18,050 --> 04:06:18,710
That's crazy.

6758
04:06:18,790 --> 04:06:20,930
I didn't know you can take the rings in front of me.

6759
04:06:21,450 --> 04:06:21,890
Hahaha!

6760
04:06:24,570 --> 04:06:25,450
Oh, chirpies!

6761
04:06:25,450 --> 04:06:26,710
If you were for me, you would take it.

6762
04:06:27,350 --> 04:06:29,290
It's like the Mario Kart item.

6763
04:06:30,310 --> 04:06:32,070
Chirpies so slow!

6764
04:06:32,550 --> 04:06:33,150
I was freaking.

6765
04:06:33,590 --> 04:06:40,890
If you were a little faster, then you could have taken these rings.

6766
04:06:41,590 --> 04:06:45,130
Yeah, and that's why I'm divorcing you, because you go a little too fast.

6767
04:06:46,130 --> 04:06:46,730
Wooohooo!

6768
04:06:48,510 --> 04:06:51,010
What the fuck in front of everybody?

6769
04:06:51,010 --> 04:06:51,710
Hahaha!

6770
04:06:54,150 --> 04:06:55,410
They had to know the truth.

6771
04:06:55,530 --> 04:06:57,450
I thought, I thought we were keeping a private.

6772
04:06:57,670 --> 04:06:59,650
I thought we were keeping a private.

6773
04:07:00,190 --> 04:07:00,650
Hahaha!

6774
04:07:00,650 --> 04:07:01,910
What the fuck?

6775
04:07:02,230 --> 04:07:02,770
Hahaha!

6776
04:07:03,590 --> 04:07:05,130
Some people like that.

6777
04:07:05,950 --> 04:07:06,930
You know that.

6778
04:07:07,210 --> 04:07:07,590
Yeah!

6779
04:07:07,650 --> 04:07:08,110
Honestly?

6780
04:07:08,210 --> 04:07:09,530
My new wife would love it.

6781
04:07:11,750 --> 04:07:12,590
I'm already planning.

6782
04:07:13,550 --> 04:07:14,110
Hahaha!

6783
04:07:14,570 --> 04:07:15,130
Hahaha!

6784
04:07:15,530 --> 04:07:16,090
Hahaha!

6785
04:07:16,190 --> 04:07:16,750
What the fuck?

6786
04:07:16,750 --> 04:07:17,390
What the fuck?

6787
04:07:19,390 --> 04:07:19,950
Yes!

6788
04:07:20,530 --> 04:07:21,090
Hahaha!

6789
04:07:21,090 --> 04:07:21,230
Hahaha!

6790
04:07:21,390 --> 04:07:22,490
I think you're right.

6791
04:07:23,150 --> 04:07:24,310
You're a sore loser.

6792
04:07:25,430 --> 04:07:27,190
You're a sore loser.

6793
04:07:31,110 --> 04:07:32,690
Yeah, I'm just gonna say it.

6794
04:07:32,930 --> 04:07:34,310
You're a sore loser.

6795
04:07:34,630 --> 04:07:35,410
Wait, how did you win?

6796
04:07:35,910 --> 04:07:36,390
What?

6797
04:07:36,750 --> 04:07:37,410
I won.

6798
04:07:37,610 --> 04:07:37,690
I won.

6799
04:07:38,650 --> 04:07:39,630
Wait, what?

6800
04:07:40,870 --> 04:07:41,350
How did you?

6801
04:07:41,350 --> 04:07:42,450
I followed the path properly.

6802
04:07:43,110 --> 04:07:43,590
What?

6803
04:07:43,650 --> 04:07:43,930
How?

6804
04:07:44,150 --> 04:07:44,630
What?

6805
04:07:45,150 --> 04:07:46,930
I think I got more rings than you.

6806
04:07:47,190 --> 04:07:48,450
How did you win?

6807
04:07:49,350 --> 04:07:50,810
I got more rings than you.

6808
04:07:51,430 --> 04:07:52,730
I'm missing checklist.

6809
04:07:52,790 --> 04:07:54,190
I apparently missing checkpoint.

6810
04:07:55,390 --> 04:07:56,630
I'm missing.

6811
04:07:57,170 --> 04:07:58,010
Wha...

6812
04:07:58,010 --> 04:07:58,930
What?

6813
04:08:00,990 --> 04:08:02,950
I didn't even realize.

6814
04:08:03,390 --> 04:08:04,150
I can't...

6815
04:08:04,150 --> 04:08:05,510
I went too fast.

6816
04:08:05,890 --> 04:08:06,930
I went...

6817
04:08:06,930 --> 04:08:09,110
that's what I was saying.

6818
04:08:09,250 --> 04:08:12,550
I can't believe you can actually go too fast.

6819
04:08:13,050 --> 04:08:15,610
That's so fucked up.

6820
04:08:16,030 --> 04:08:18,310
I can't believe it.

6821
04:08:18,650 --> 04:08:19,870
Everything's a lie.

6822
04:08:20,070 --> 04:08:20,790
Come on, come.

6823
04:08:20,790 --> 04:08:20,870
Why?

6824
04:08:23,710 --> 04:08:25,410
Everything's a fucking lie!

6825
04:08:26,810 --> 04:08:28,810
One day you'll learn your lesson.

6826
04:08:29,430 --> 04:08:31,150
Today might not be that day.

6827
04:08:33,490 --> 04:08:34,810
I'm so sad.

6828
04:08:36,110 --> 04:08:41,630
I need to fucking head to bed and listen to some Linkin Park.

6829
04:08:44,650 --> 04:08:45,510
Where do we go?

6830
04:08:45,690 --> 04:08:46,070
Here?

6831
04:08:47,410 --> 04:08:48,590
Oh, it's back here.

6832
04:08:51,190 --> 04:08:52,530
Where's the last one though?

6833
04:08:55,670 --> 04:08:56,950
Which one did we do already?

6834
04:08:57,150 --> 04:08:57,710
I can't tell.

6835
04:08:57,910 --> 04:08:59,390
Everything looks the same.

6836
04:09:00,450 --> 04:09:01,750
Which one are we missing?

6837
04:09:03,650 --> 04:09:04,410
This one.

6838
04:09:04,630 --> 04:09:05,290
Oh, it's this one.

6839
04:09:05,330 --> 04:09:06,210
We follow this pipe.

6840
04:09:08,310 --> 04:09:09,230
I see it.

6841
04:09:17,140 --> 04:09:18,740
I feel so empty inside.

6842
04:09:20,640 --> 04:09:21,120
Okay!

6843
04:09:27,540 --> 04:09:28,940
I feel so empty.

6844
04:09:33,460 --> 04:09:35,920
I don't have the Seabat rhythm!

6845
04:09:36,180 --> 04:09:37,040
What do you mean?

6846
04:09:40,760 --> 04:09:42,100
That's a good rhythm anyway.

6847
04:09:42,380 --> 04:09:43,600
You guys are just fucking...

6848
04:09:43,600 --> 04:09:44,500
Where the fuck are you?

6849
04:09:44,620 --> 04:09:45,080
I don't know.

6850
04:09:45,460 --> 04:09:46,620
I don't know.

6851
04:09:47,240 --> 04:09:48,520
How did you get there?

6852
04:09:58,150 --> 04:09:59,610
How do you get in there?

6853
04:10:02,570 --> 04:10:03,150
What the fuck?

6854
04:10:03,930 --> 04:10:04,970
I'm so confused.

6855
04:10:06,190 --> 04:10:07,210
Where are you?

6856
04:10:08,210 --> 04:10:09,110
Oh, there you are.

6857
04:10:09,250 --> 04:10:10,170
I figured it out.

6858
04:10:12,150 --> 04:10:13,110
What do you do?

6859
04:10:17,370 --> 04:10:19,890
Here, stay right there.

6860
04:10:20,050 --> 04:10:20,410
Okay.

6861
04:10:23,030 --> 04:10:23,970
I stay here?

6862
04:10:24,230 --> 04:10:24,950
Go pull the other side.

6863
04:10:25,090 --> 04:10:25,870
Go pull the other side.

6864
04:10:26,590 --> 04:10:27,670
There's another side?

6865
04:10:33,400 --> 04:10:34,280
Oh, there is!

6866
04:10:34,800 --> 04:10:35,900
Wait, there's no other side.

6867
04:10:36,120 --> 04:10:36,760
What are you talking about?

6868
04:10:38,180 --> 04:10:40,040
I think I have to find the hole.

6869
04:10:41,220 --> 04:10:42,280
I have experience with that.

6870
04:10:42,300 --> 04:10:42,540
Don't worry.

6871
04:10:42,620 --> 04:10:43,060
Watch this.

6872
04:10:44,440 --> 04:10:44,800
Wait.

6873
04:10:48,870 --> 04:10:49,510
Give me a sec.

6874
04:10:56,370 --> 04:10:57,270
Oh, it's here!

6875
04:10:57,450 --> 04:10:57,710
It's here!

6876
04:10:57,790 --> 04:10:58,090
It's here!

6877
04:10:58,170 --> 04:10:58,430
It's here!

6878
04:10:58,510 --> 04:10:58,830
It's here!

6879
04:10:58,930 --> 04:10:59,450
Wait, no.

6880
04:11:00,470 --> 04:11:00,830
Wait.

6881
04:11:02,210 --> 04:11:02,850
Wait, Gumi.

6882
04:11:02,890 --> 04:11:03,170
I need help.

6883
04:11:03,190 --> 04:11:04,610
What do I do, Gumi?

6884
04:11:05,110 --> 04:11:06,850
I need you to teach me.

6885
04:11:06,910 --> 04:11:07,650
What do I do?

6886
04:11:08,510 --> 04:11:10,150
I felt like you saw it.

6887
04:11:12,130 --> 04:11:13,090
I didn't.

6888
04:11:13,530 --> 04:11:14,870
I didn't.

6889
04:11:14,870 --> 04:11:15,490
What do I do?

6890
04:11:17,070 --> 04:11:18,230
Go find the hole.

6891
04:11:18,570 --> 04:11:20,650
But what if I can't find it?

6892
04:11:22,990 --> 04:11:23,990
Go find the hole.

6893
04:11:24,230 --> 04:11:24,790
Where?

6894
04:11:25,030 --> 04:11:26,050
Where is the hole?

6895
04:11:27,690 --> 04:11:28,990
Is it here?

6896
04:11:29,830 --> 04:11:30,390
No.

6897
04:11:30,750 --> 04:11:32,430
No, that's not...

6898
04:11:34,090 --> 04:11:35,110
Where is it?

6899
04:11:37,050 --> 04:11:38,970
This is... This is the hole.

6900
04:11:40,070 --> 04:11:40,590
Hole?

6901
04:11:41,410 --> 04:11:42,890
Or maybe it's here.

6902
04:11:43,770 --> 04:11:44,290
No.

6903
04:11:44,930 --> 04:11:46,530
The hole is the goal.

6904
04:11:48,850 --> 04:11:50,230
Are you divorced yet?

6905
04:11:50,310 --> 04:11:50,750
I wish.

6906
04:11:52,090 --> 04:11:54,090
I'm here, but this is not open.

6907
04:11:54,270 --> 04:11:54,290
Hey!

6908
04:11:54,430 --> 04:11:56,390
I think I need you to open this one for me.

6909
04:11:56,390 --> 04:11:57,310
Yeah, you need to open this.

6910
04:11:58,410 --> 04:11:59,230
Yeah, see?

6911
04:12:00,170 --> 04:12:02,010
I knew it wasn't me!

6912
04:12:03,190 --> 04:12:03,790
I can see the generator!

6913
04:12:04,110 --> 04:12:05,310
It's on the opposite side!

6914
04:12:05,310 --> 04:12:09,010
To be fair, I saw it earlier, but I wanted to see if you would say something.

6915
04:12:09,230 --> 04:12:09,770
I knew it!

6916
04:12:09,770 --> 04:12:11,250
I knew it wasn't me!

6917
04:12:12,270 --> 04:12:13,630
It's a group effort.

6918
04:12:14,890 --> 04:12:16,730
It's pretty warm in here.

6919
04:12:16,950 --> 04:12:18,070
Is that lava?

6920
04:12:18,530 --> 04:12:19,790
Where do we have to take me to?

6921
04:12:19,990 --> 04:12:20,390
Here?

6922
04:12:21,410 --> 04:12:22,750
I don't think so, right?

6923
04:12:24,750 --> 04:12:25,550
Is it here?

6924
04:12:26,090 --> 04:12:27,350
Ah, halfway there.

6925
04:12:28,390 --> 04:12:29,730
So where do we go from here?

6926
04:12:29,870 --> 04:12:30,390
Yeah, we're...

6927
04:12:31,910 --> 04:12:33,170
I don't think it's this way.

6928
04:12:33,170 --> 04:12:34,730
I think we have to go above.

6929
04:12:35,910 --> 04:12:37,210
Do you turn more or no?

6930
04:12:40,170 --> 04:12:41,630
Where do we go from here?

6931
04:12:48,080 --> 04:12:48,520
Woo!

6932
04:12:48,920 --> 04:12:49,160
Hey!

6933
04:12:49,320 --> 04:12:49,480
Hey!

6934
04:12:49,660 --> 04:12:50,900
Try turning it around!

6935
04:12:51,220 --> 04:12:52,200
Oh, yeah, yeah!

6936
04:12:52,320 --> 04:12:52,840
There we go!

6937
04:12:53,060 --> 04:12:54,840
And then you turn... I have to go higher.

6938
04:12:55,100 --> 04:12:56,040
Can I go higher or no?

6939
04:12:58,620 --> 04:12:59,340
Go higher.

6940
04:13:00,860 --> 04:13:01,740
I'm trying!

6941
04:13:02,180 --> 04:13:02,780
Go higher.

6942
04:13:03,860 --> 04:13:05,000
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice!

6943
04:13:05,060 --> 04:13:05,560
That's high enough!

6944
04:13:06,720 --> 04:13:07,160
Yay!

6945
04:13:09,960 --> 04:13:12,880
I know it's a bit difficult to rely on you right now.

6946
04:13:15,520 --> 04:13:16,960
I think I need to go to sleep.

6947
04:13:17,260 --> 04:13:18,420
I think I need to go to sleep.

6948
04:13:23,840 --> 04:13:24,820
I'm doing it!

6949
04:13:25,140 --> 04:13:25,620
Yeah!

6950
04:13:38,760 --> 04:13:39,960
I did it!

6951
04:13:40,380 --> 04:13:40,860
Yay!

6952
04:13:43,980 --> 04:13:47,140
Why do I feel like Mei does a lot of the heavy lifting?

6953
04:13:50,020 --> 04:13:50,860
Oh no.

6954
04:13:51,200 --> 04:13:53,780
I feel like I did an equal amount of work there.

6955
04:14:04,320 --> 04:14:06,100
There's no I in marriage.

6956
04:14:07,620 --> 04:14:08,540
Oh my God.

6957
04:14:10,980 --> 04:14:12,700
There's an I in marriage!

6958
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:15,500
Did you notice that?

6959
04:14:15,520 --> 04:14:17,120
I'm saying that this entire time.

6960
04:14:17,120 --> 04:14:45,820
I just blocked you out.

6961
04:14:47,120 --> 04:14:53,100
You say some shit like, oh teamwork, look teamwork, and I just block it out.

6962
04:14:55,040 --> 04:14:57,860
A marriage needs communication, Gumi.

6963
04:14:58,060 --> 04:15:01,740
You need to communicate when you feel like it's too much.

6964
04:15:01,980 --> 04:15:07,080
I communicate to you, but you need to start listening to me.

6965
04:15:08,280 --> 04:15:08,900
Huh?

6966
04:15:08,940 --> 04:15:09,460
You say something?

6967
04:15:12,380 --> 04:15:13,000
Push.

6968
04:15:13,000 --> 04:15:13,080
Push.

6969
04:15:16,760 --> 04:15:18,880
I think I need to go make another artichoke.

6970
04:15:20,420 --> 04:15:21,080
Oh no!

6971
04:15:23,050 --> 04:15:24,530
What about your artichoke?

6972
04:15:24,670 --> 04:15:24,930
What?

6973
04:15:25,270 --> 04:15:26,450
I need to make it for grandpa!

6974
04:15:27,750 --> 04:15:28,270
What?

6975
04:15:31,150 --> 04:15:33,570
Is she left to make her artichoke?

6976
04:15:35,130 --> 04:15:39,690
I think she left to make her artichoke.

6977
04:15:42,630 --> 04:15:44,450
This is gonna be so romantic.

6978
04:15:46,410 --> 04:15:51,090
Oh no, Gumi's not gonna be here to see the romance blossom between us.

6979
04:15:54,850 --> 04:15:56,430
Yeah, for grandpa.

6980
04:15:57,210 --> 04:16:00,030
Yeah, we have earned it.

6981
04:16:00,110 --> 04:16:00,750
See, we!

6982
04:16:01,510 --> 04:16:03,970
Even the game agrees this is teamwork.

6983
04:16:04,170 --> 04:16:05,010
I don't understand.

6984
04:16:12,700 --> 04:16:16,040
You know, we haven't been on vacation since Rose was born.

6985
04:16:16,540 --> 04:16:17,060
Really?

6986
04:16:17,400 --> 04:16:18,840
Has it been that long?

6987
04:16:19,200 --> 04:16:19,600
Yep.

6988
04:16:22,460 --> 04:16:24,280
Why did we stop going skiing?

6989
04:16:25,420 --> 04:16:27,020
Well, Rose was born...

6990
04:16:27,020 --> 04:16:28,120
Cause Rose hates skiing!

6991
04:16:28,660 --> 04:16:29,560
...and the bills piled up.

6992
04:16:29,760 --> 04:16:30,100
Yeah.

6993
04:16:30,700 --> 04:16:31,580
Yeah, I guess.

6994
04:16:32,220 --> 04:16:33,500
She hates the snow.

6995
04:16:34,020 --> 04:16:34,740
...and the link in the roof, remember?

6996
04:16:34,960 --> 04:16:36,320
Oh, don't remind me.

6997
04:16:38,360 --> 04:16:42,560
Maybe once we sold the house, there might be some money left over for a weekend trip.

6998
04:16:42,660 --> 04:16:42,800
See?

6999
04:16:42,800 --> 04:16:44,080
Timer for f**king f**king it!

7000
04:16:44,100 --> 04:16:45,180
And you could take Rose to Waterland.

7001
04:16:45,440 --> 04:16:46,760
Yeah, it's a great idea.

7002
04:16:47,660 --> 04:16:49,880
She's been bugging us all summer to take her there.

7003
04:16:50,040 --> 04:16:52,020
And then I'll take her again when it's my turn.

7004
04:16:52,220 --> 04:16:53,040
Yeah, she'll have to go twice!

7005
04:16:53,400 --> 04:16:55,820
Oh my god, we're talking about custody!

7006
04:16:56,500 --> 04:16:57,220
Yeah, double the fun.

7007
04:17:00,340 --> 04:17:01,280
Can you say something?

7008
04:17:01,880 --> 04:17:03,360
We're talking about the custody!

7009
04:17:03,880 --> 04:17:05,320
You're gonna have full custody, right?

7010
04:17:06,400 --> 04:17:07,080
Let's race!

7011
04:17:07,640 --> 04:17:07,980
What?

7012
04:17:08,100 --> 04:17:09,740
I thought you were the fun-shot- fun dad.

7013
04:17:09,920 --> 04:17:14,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I come over like once every- once a week.

7014
04:17:14,920 --> 04:17:16,740
So like, she'll continue with things.

7015
04:17:16,740 --> 04:17:17,300
Thinking I'm fun.

7016
04:17:18,040 --> 04:17:20,060
Because I only show up when it's fun time.

7017
04:17:20,240 --> 04:17:21,220
Come on, be elite, Cody!

7018
04:17:21,920 --> 04:17:23,720
Yeah, you're the best kid, boo!

7019
04:17:24,020 --> 04:17:29,140
So it's like, you know, I can be like, Rose, it's time to go to the amusement park!

7020
04:17:29,780 --> 04:17:30,960
It's daddy's time!

7021
04:17:32,200 --> 04:17:33,240
The Sunday dad!

7022
04:17:33,340 --> 04:17:34,680
Yeah, I'm the Sunday dad!

7023
04:17:35,020 --> 04:17:35,460
Exactly!

7024
04:17:36,740 --> 04:17:37,460
Best kind!

7025
04:17:40,980 --> 04:17:43,280
So she'll always remember me as the fun one.

7026
04:17:44,680 --> 04:17:45,120
Woo!

7027
04:17:49,960 --> 04:17:50,840
It's sundad!

7028
04:17:50,920 --> 04:17:51,220
Yeah!

7029
04:17:51,460 --> 04:17:53,500
Instead of Sunday, it's sundad!

7030
04:17:55,060 --> 04:17:56,240
I figured it out.

7031
04:17:57,760 --> 04:17:58,200
Lame!

7032
04:18:00,980 --> 04:18:02,560
What do you mean lame?

7033
04:18:04,440 --> 04:18:06,520
You're just jealous because you're not the fun mom.

7034
04:18:07,580 --> 04:18:09,740
Yeah, and then I'm gonna have a badass motorcycle.

7035
04:18:10,320 --> 04:18:13,920
And- I'm gonna have my midlife crisis.

7036
04:18:14,300 --> 04:18:17,800
And then Rose is gonna be like, um, um, Mom!

7037
04:18:17,800 --> 04:18:19,900
Why aren't you as fun as sundad?

7038
04:18:20,020 --> 04:18:21,120
I'm going to dad's!

7039
04:18:21,200 --> 04:18:25,240
And then she's gonna see me in my, um, in my bachelor pad.

7040
04:18:25,620 --> 04:18:27,340
And it's gonna look so fucking sad.

7041
04:18:27,480 --> 04:18:29,100
And I'll be like, Rose, what are you doing here?

7042
04:18:29,600 --> 04:18:30,040
Hey!

7043
04:18:30,720 --> 04:18:31,400
I'm seeing you make it!

7044
04:18:31,400 --> 04:18:32,660
It's not sundad day!

7045
04:18:33,740 --> 04:18:38,720
And she's gonna be like, yeah, mom was wishing me, can I live off your money and bills now?

7046
04:18:39,000 --> 04:18:41,540
And then I was like, oh, sweetie.

7047
04:18:42,340 --> 04:18:43,860
We have an arrangement.

7048
04:18:43,960 --> 04:18:46,560
There's a reason why I'm sundad.

7049
04:18:50,120 --> 04:18:51,500
Oh my god, what the fuck?

7050
04:18:51,600 --> 04:18:53,260
This guy, this guy looks scary.

7051
04:18:53,580 --> 04:18:54,620
Bro, he's chained up.

7052
04:18:56,880 --> 04:19:00,160
I have a feeling we should- Yeah, me too.

7053
04:19:00,420 --> 04:19:01,720
He's chained up for a reason.

7054
04:19:02,020 --> 04:19:02,840
Why are you going this way?

7055
04:19:03,400 --> 04:19:06,980
There's no way to- I thought we can wall jump this, but there's no way to do that.

7056
04:19:10,880 --> 04:19:13,420
Oh, take him near- oh, wait, wait, take him over here!

7057
04:19:13,580 --> 04:19:14,660
Yeah, let me bring him.

7058
04:19:16,920 --> 04:19:18,300
Oh, is that a monster?

7059
04:19:18,500 --> 04:19:19,140
That's too real.

7060
04:19:19,380 --> 04:19:20,520
Whatever it is, I'm glad it's frozen.

7061
04:19:20,540 --> 04:19:21,200
But I'm fun.

7062
04:19:21,300 --> 04:19:22,080
At least I'll be fun.

7063
04:19:24,100 --> 04:19:24,700
I'm stuck.

7064
04:19:24,880 --> 04:19:25,440
I'm stuck.

7065
04:19:26,360 --> 04:19:27,620
I don't know how to put you out.

7066
04:19:31,990 --> 04:19:33,610
You don't pull, you push, remember?

7067
04:19:33,770 --> 04:19:34,390
You push!

7068
04:19:34,550 --> 04:19:35,550
You push, remember?

7069
04:19:37,370 --> 04:19:37,770
Push.

7070
04:19:41,550 --> 04:19:42,270
Stop pushing.

7071
04:19:42,670 --> 04:19:42,890
Oh.

7072
04:19:43,130 --> 04:19:43,370
Oh.

7073
04:19:45,830 --> 04:19:46,230
Yay.

7074
04:19:50,010 --> 04:19:50,410
Magnets!

7075
04:19:51,370 --> 04:19:51,770
Yeah!

7076
04:19:53,910 --> 04:19:55,010
I love magnets.

7077
04:19:59,240 --> 04:20:00,560
Help me, Stepdokie.

7078
04:20:00,800 --> 04:20:05,720
Oh my god, no, and then you're gonna get- You're gonna- I'll be like the cool dad, and then I fucked up.

7079
04:20:08,200 --> 04:20:09,160
Why did you-

7080
04:20:13,380 --> 04:20:16,720
I think you're supposed to- no, it's because you're supposed to take me to the fishhooks over there.

7081
04:20:17,040 --> 04:20:20,240
I didn't fuck up, I realized we fucked up together.

7082
04:20:21,560 --> 04:20:24,480
Because I was supposed to go to the fishhooks.

7083
04:20:25,660 --> 04:20:34,600
Yeah, and then when your mom remarries, when Gumi remarries, you're gonna realize your stepdad is not as cool as me.

7084
04:20:38,750 --> 04:20:46,590
I'm gonna show up with my badass motorcycle, and I'll be like, oh, is- is- is Jerry treating you okay, Rose?

7085
04:20:47,450 --> 04:20:48,570
What's with you?

7086
04:20:48,750 --> 04:20:50,770
You're gonna name Jerry, man.

7087
04:20:53,250 --> 04:20:56,210
I bet Jerry didn't bring you a pony.

7088
04:21:01,930 --> 04:21:03,650
Alright, what is this?

7089
04:21:06,350 --> 04:21:06,990
Oh wait, no?

7090
04:21:07,330 --> 04:21:08,310
What do I do here?

7091
04:21:12,010 --> 04:21:13,170
Alright, pull this down?

7092
04:21:13,610 --> 04:21:14,470
What is this?

7093
04:21:23,900 --> 04:21:27,180
Many times do I have to teach you, old man, you're not pulling nothing.

7094
04:21:30,640 --> 04:21:32,020
I'm a little confused.

7095
04:21:34,300 --> 04:21:35,600
How do you get here?

7096
04:21:35,720 --> 04:21:38,340
Did I- Did I fuck something up?

7097
04:21:39,520 --> 04:21:40,940
No, I couldn't.

7098
04:21:40,940 --> 04:21:41,400
I'm smart.

7099
04:21:41,940 --> 04:21:43,040
No, you're supposed to come here!

7100
04:21:43,300 --> 04:21:44,760
I- I did a platform for you.

7101
04:21:44,920 --> 04:21:45,760
I made you this.

7102
04:21:46,600 --> 04:21:48,080
Look, I did this.

7103
04:21:52,440 --> 04:21:53,460
I did this.

7104
04:21:54,900 --> 04:21:55,620
You're welcome.

7105
04:21:56,380 --> 04:21:57,300
Shut up.

7106
04:22:01,720 --> 04:22:02,180
Yay!

7107
04:22:05,580 --> 04:22:07,280
Alright, and then you're supposed to do this one.

7108
04:22:07,420 --> 04:22:07,880
Right here.

7109
04:22:08,660 --> 04:22:09,440
No, right here.

7110
04:22:09,440 --> 04:22:09,460
Right here.

7111
04:22:09,660 --> 04:22:10,780
Go next to me.

7112
04:22:11,580 --> 04:22:15,900
I thought you were- Yeah.

7113
04:22:16,280 --> 04:22:19,500
And then I jump over, and you pull it.

7114
04:22:20,520 --> 04:22:21,040
Yeah!

7115
04:22:22,140 --> 04:22:23,240
We're doing it!

7116
04:22:24,200 --> 04:22:25,540
I'm using my brain!

7117
04:22:26,940 --> 04:22:28,280
I need a water break.

7118
04:22:28,380 --> 04:22:30,460
I'm using 1% of my brain!

7119
04:22:30,660 --> 04:22:31,580
This is it!

7120
04:22:34,020 --> 04:22:34,540
Boomy?

7121
04:22:37,300 --> 04:22:37,820
Boomy?

7122
04:22:40,380 --> 04:22:40,880
Boomy.

7123
04:22:41,660 --> 04:22:42,900
My hand hurty.

7124
04:22:47,800 --> 04:22:48,300
Boomy?

7125
04:22:49,380 --> 04:22:49,880
Huh?

7126
04:22:50,680 --> 04:22:51,380
The hook?

7127
04:22:54,700 --> 04:22:55,620
No, the other one.

7128
04:22:57,240 --> 04:22:58,680
Just one to your right.

7129
04:22:59,000 --> 04:23:00,380
I don't think this is gonna move.

7130
04:23:00,460 --> 04:23:01,220
Yeah, this doesn't move.

7131
04:23:05,290 --> 04:23:05,990
It's okay.

7132
04:23:06,530 --> 04:23:07,950
I know you don't mean that.

7133
04:23:07,970 --> 04:23:08,170
I'm getting ready.

7134
04:23:10,670 --> 04:23:11,170
I'm getting ready.

7135
04:23:11,170 --> 04:23:11,250
Oh, hahaha!

7136
04:23:15,250 --> 04:23:16,090
Alright, nice.

7137
04:23:16,930 --> 04:23:18,650
Alright, move me to the other side.

7138
04:23:20,090 --> 04:23:20,510
Yay!

7139
04:23:20,670 --> 04:23:21,030
Please!

7140
04:23:22,550 --> 04:23:24,090
Move me to the other side.

7141
04:23:28,950 --> 04:23:31,410
I don't need to say please, we're already married.

7142
04:23:31,770 --> 04:23:32,970
Ha ha ha.

7143
04:23:35,150 --> 04:23:35,570
Okay.

7144
04:23:36,850 --> 04:23:37,270
Haha.

7145
04:23:37,650 --> 04:23:41,150
Julmy, I know you want this game to be over, so you have to move me to the other side, okay?

7146
04:23:41,150 --> 04:23:41,810
To the other side.

7147
04:23:42,010 --> 04:23:48,390
The longer you stay here, the longer we're gonna be playing this game.

7148
04:23:48,610 --> 04:23:50,650
You know you can't avoid that.

7149
04:23:58,890 --> 04:24:00,310
There you go, I made it.

7150
04:24:02,210 --> 04:24:02,830
Nice.

7151
04:24:03,130 --> 04:24:03,550
Yay!

7152
04:24:08,210 --> 04:24:12,030
The longer you delay this, the longer we stay married.

7153
04:24:17,630 --> 04:24:18,490
Okay, here you go.

7154
04:24:19,590 --> 04:24:20,130
Woo!

7155
04:24:20,390 --> 04:24:21,370
Oh my god, is that bones?

7156
04:24:27,330 --> 04:24:28,970
Whose bones are these?

7157
04:24:29,190 --> 04:24:31,590
In the f- Yeah, I know, in the cube!

7158
04:24:32,330 --> 04:24:34,030
Whose bones are these?

7159
04:24:35,170 --> 04:24:36,630
In the snow globe!

7160
04:24:40,390 --> 04:24:40,930
Yay!

7161
04:24:41,690 --> 04:24:42,190
Woo!

7162
04:24:47,990 --> 04:24:50,270
I still can't believe I missed the checkpoint.

7163
04:24:51,110 --> 04:24:52,970
I still can't believe.

7164
04:24:52,970 --> 04:24:53,410
What'd you say?

7165
04:24:53,630 --> 04:24:56,550
I can't believe I missed the checkpoint in that race.

7166
04:24:56,790 --> 04:24:58,490
I can't believe it.

7167
04:24:59,690 --> 04:25:02,350
I got a little more checkpoints needed.

7168
04:25:03,990 --> 04:25:07,590
I thought it was all about going fast and being efficient.

7169
04:25:08,190 --> 04:25:11,390
It was all a lie.

7170
04:25:13,890 --> 04:25:15,270
It was all a lie.

7171
04:25:21,110 --> 04:25:23,130
I can't wait to eat another artichoke tonight.

7172
04:25:23,190 --> 04:25:23,830
I'm still ahead.

7173
04:25:24,210 --> 04:25:24,290
Woo!

7174
04:25:25,910 --> 04:25:26,590
No you're not.

7175
04:25:26,590 --> 04:25:28,330
Wait, what the f- how did you get the airtime?

7176
04:25:32,660 --> 04:25:34,940
Where did you get the airtime for this?

7177
04:25:36,000 --> 04:25:36,720
Uh-huh.

7178
04:25:39,520 --> 04:25:40,800
It's okay, I made it ahead.

7179
04:25:41,660 --> 04:25:42,100
Okay.

7180
04:25:44,700 --> 04:25:45,960
We're still not at the top?

7181
04:25:53,840 --> 04:25:55,840
Oh god.

7182
04:25:56,360 --> 04:25:57,280
Ugh.

7183
04:26:00,120 --> 04:26:01,400
This man.

7184
04:26:02,040 --> 04:26:03,080
Oh god.

7185
04:26:05,080 --> 04:26:06,080
Ha!

7186
04:26:08,800 --> 04:26:10,040
What the hell?

7187
04:26:10,440 --> 04:26:10,980
You mean relationship with a P?

7188
04:26:11,280 --> 04:26:11,820
No.

7189
04:26:12,020 --> 04:26:13,900
Relation shit.

7190
04:26:14,060 --> 04:26:15,840
As in shit like caca.

7191
04:26:15,840 --> 04:26:19,340
You need to rebuild your relationship into a relation shit.

7192
04:26:19,340 --> 04:26:21,100
Why can't we just close the door on him?

7193
04:26:21,200 --> 04:26:23,280
This guy just really likes saying shit, doesn't he?

7194
04:26:23,960 --> 04:26:25,720
I wish we could build a fire.

7195
04:26:26,700 --> 04:26:27,040
Remember?

7196
04:26:27,300 --> 04:26:31,000
When something collapses, something new can be built.

7197
04:26:31,060 --> 04:26:31,360
Shark.

7198
04:26:31,800 --> 04:26:34,520
And then the attraction can grow freely.

7199
04:26:34,520 --> 04:26:34,900
Please.

7200
04:26:34,900 --> 04:26:35,040
Please stop.

7201
04:26:35,320 --> 04:26:35,640
You know?

7202
04:26:35,840 --> 04:26:36,500
Oh no.

7203
04:26:37,160 --> 04:26:39,260
This is a PG question for Elyse Shreen.

7204
04:26:39,640 --> 04:26:39,740
Let's break it, baby!

7205
04:26:40,020 --> 04:26:40,780
Come on!

7206
04:26:40,940 --> 04:26:42,380
I'm gonna shark.

7207
04:26:42,580 --> 04:26:43,360
Please stop.

7208
04:26:44,140 --> 04:26:45,800
I hope you shark your pants.

7209
04:26:45,840 --> 04:26:46,620
Stop!

7210
04:26:47,640 --> 04:26:48,040
Stop!

7211
04:26:49,560 --> 04:26:51,100
Shark yourself.

7212
04:26:51,340 --> 04:26:51,840
Stop!

7213
04:26:52,220 --> 04:26:53,200
We are...

7214
04:26:53,200 --> 04:26:55,380
We are mature adults here.

7215
04:26:56,720 --> 04:26:57,920
We are...

7216
04:26:57,920 --> 04:26:59,940
We are mature people.

7217
04:27:00,860 --> 04:27:02,340
We do...

7218
04:27:02,340 --> 04:27:03,460
We do...

7219
04:27:03,460 --> 04:27:06,540
We do very smart adult jokes here.

7220
04:27:08,960 --> 04:27:10,160
Shark thyself.

7221
04:27:12,020 --> 04:27:14,300
So much for a pleasant trip.

7222
04:27:14,420 --> 04:27:15,000
What the fuck?

7223
04:27:15,000 --> 04:27:16,680
Are you like dashing in front of me?

7224
04:27:18,900 --> 04:27:21,260
I'm trying to go as fast as I can.

7225
04:27:21,800 --> 04:27:23,720
And I was just having fun.

7226
04:27:24,140 --> 04:27:24,400
Woo!

7227
04:27:25,300 --> 04:27:26,140
Look at that.

7228
04:27:26,220 --> 04:27:27,780
You're having fun almost dying.

7229
04:27:27,940 --> 04:27:28,780
That's fucked up.

7230
04:27:30,240 --> 04:27:30,760
Eh.

7231
04:27:32,200 --> 04:27:32,720
Great.

7232
04:27:32,940 --> 04:27:33,380
I'm here.

7233
04:27:33,480 --> 04:27:34,820
You know what I'm saying?

7234
04:27:34,960 --> 04:27:36,040
You're like extreme sports.

7235
04:27:39,560 --> 04:27:43,380
You know Tony Hawk is like almost...

7236
04:27:43,380 --> 04:27:43,500
Wait.

7237
04:27:43,500 --> 04:27:44,480
He's like 60, right?

7238
04:27:44,920 --> 04:27:46,060
That's actually crazy.

7239
04:27:47,080 --> 04:27:49,580
He's like somewhere in 50s or 60s now.

7240
04:27:49,700 --> 04:27:50,980
And he's still skateboarding.

7241
04:27:53,920 --> 04:27:55,940
That's gotta be me when I'm in my 60s.

7242
04:27:56,440 --> 04:27:57,220
That's a lie.

7243
04:28:05,010 --> 04:28:06,490
Dude, leave us alone.

7244
04:28:06,530 --> 04:28:07,350
Leave us alone.

7245
04:28:07,610 --> 04:28:08,610
This is creepy.

7246
04:28:09,070 --> 04:28:11,410
We can fix our relationship without you.

7247
04:28:14,910 --> 04:28:15,650
Oh, God.

7248
04:28:15,670 --> 04:28:18,010
We're getting magnetized.

7249
04:28:18,010 --> 04:28:18,690
Oh, God.

7250
04:28:18,690 --> 04:28:19,050
We're getting magnetized.

7251
04:28:19,250 --> 04:28:21,150
We're getting magnetized.

7252
04:28:21,410 --> 04:28:22,010
This is the best thing that's ever been done to me.

7253
04:28:22,010 --> 04:28:22,110
This is the best thing that I've ever done.

7254
04:28:25,640 --> 04:28:27,520
He's still shredding it at 55.

7255
04:28:29,140 --> 04:28:30,400
What the fuck are you doing?

7256
04:28:32,580 --> 04:28:33,800
How do I do this?

7257
04:28:35,120 --> 04:28:35,720
Oh!

7258
04:28:37,240 --> 04:28:38,340
You're free now.

7259
04:28:40,960 --> 04:28:41,560
Oh!

7260
04:28:45,980 --> 04:28:47,700
We can like body slam.

7261
04:28:48,020 --> 04:28:49,400
These babies are strong.

7262
04:28:49,620 --> 04:28:50,120
Indeed.

7263
04:28:50,120 --> 04:28:52,420
Indeed, the hole is greater than the parts.

7264
04:28:52,740 --> 04:28:55,400
The magnet's attraction is getting stronger.

7265
04:28:56,900 --> 04:28:57,920
Wait, what the fuck?

7266
04:28:58,280 --> 04:28:59,680
It's artichoke time!

7267
04:29:00,180 --> 04:29:01,120
Wait, what?

7268
04:29:02,980 --> 04:29:03,660
What?

7269
04:29:04,740 --> 04:29:05,860
What the fuck?

7270
04:29:05,980 --> 04:29:06,680
Be a bat.

7271
04:29:06,840 --> 04:29:07,200
Goalie!

7272
04:29:07,380 --> 04:29:08,120
What the fuck?

7273
04:29:08,120 --> 04:29:09,500
We're still in this game!

7274
04:29:10,820 --> 04:29:13,720
At least head over... oh my god.

7275
04:29:17,360 --> 04:29:21,800
We're so close to finishing this chapter!

7276
04:29:28,260 --> 04:29:35,440
Oh my god!

7277
04:29:35,620 --> 04:29:37,440
We were so close!

7278
04:29:39,580 --> 04:29:42,160
We were almost there!

7279
04:29:46,140 --> 04:29:46,860
Oh...

7280
04:29:48,440 --> 04:29:49,160
Oh...

7281
04:29:49,160 --> 04:29:49,280
Oh...

7282
04:29:51,100 --> 04:29:52,340
Artichoke over...

7283
04:29:52,340 --> 04:29:53,540
Artichoke...

7284
04:29:56,540 --> 04:29:58,340
Let me go!

7285
04:29:59,040 --> 04:30:01,420
Why did you pick artichoke?

7286
04:30:05,320 --> 04:30:07,280
We were so close.

7287
04:30:07,480 --> 04:30:09,740
We were so close to finishing this chapter.

7288
04:30:09,960 --> 04:30:11,640
It was literally right there.

7289
04:30:11,840 --> 04:30:13,700
It was literally right there.

7290
04:30:13,720 --> 04:30:16,480
Oh my god.

7291
04:30:17,640 --> 04:30:19,160
It's okay guys.

7292
04:30:19,340 --> 04:30:22,780
One day we can finish this chapter.

7293
04:30:23,100 --> 04:30:24,880
One day.

7294
04:30:25,540 --> 04:30:28,760
I put... I believe in us.

7295
04:30:28,840 --> 04:30:34,900
I can't believe she picked an artichoke over me!

7296
04:30:35,640 --> 04:30:37,280
I don't understand!

7297
04:30:38,800 --> 04:30:40,740
Can I get a ride?

7298
04:30:41,080 --> 04:30:42,320
I don't understand!

7299
04:30:45,400 --> 04:30:45,880
I can't believe it!

7300
04:30:45,880 --> 04:30:46,800
But I'm... I'm Doki!

7301
04:30:47,140 --> 04:30:48,000
Look at me!

7302
04:30:48,700 --> 04:30:49,620
Look at this...

7303
04:30:49,620 --> 04:30:51,100
And I fucking love artichokes.

7304
04:30:51,220 --> 04:30:52,620
I can't believe it.

7305
04:30:52,720 --> 04:30:55,260
Alright, if I was dangling off a cliff...

7306
04:30:55,260 --> 04:30:57,580
but there's an artichoke next to you...

7307
04:30:58,280 --> 04:30:58,760
Huh?

7308
04:30:59,980 --> 04:31:00,900
Get over here.

7309
04:31:01,660 --> 04:31:02,140
Whoops.

7310
04:31:03,860 --> 04:31:05,160
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

7311
04:31:05,220 --> 04:31:06,320
You... you... you jump to me.

7312
04:31:06,620 --> 04:31:08,260
You will attract over... Yeah there he is.

7313
04:31:08,460 --> 04:31:11,660
Oh, I can really feel this magnet pulling towards you!

7314
04:31:12,560 --> 04:31:13,040
Really?

7315
04:31:15,460 --> 04:31:18,280
What does the archer have that I don't have?

7316
04:31:19,380 --> 04:31:20,020
Flavor.

7317
04:31:20,540 --> 04:31:21,180
What?

7318
04:31:21,340 --> 04:31:21,880
What is that?

7319
04:31:24,460 --> 04:31:25,740
Good flavor.

7320
04:31:30,320 --> 04:31:31,280
Good flavor.

7321
04:31:32,160 --> 04:31:32,800
Vegetable.

7322
04:31:33,000 --> 04:31:34,000
I love vegetable.

7323
04:31:37,240 --> 04:31:39,160
I'm not gonna comment anymore.

7324
04:31:39,460 --> 04:31:41,400
I love vegetable.

7325
04:31:44,800 --> 04:31:45,740
Oh, wait, what?

7326
04:31:46,020 --> 04:31:47,560
Wait, but like, how do...

7327
04:31:47,560 --> 04:31:48,540
I'm so confused.

7328
04:31:48,740 --> 04:31:50,420
You have to wait until we're both ready.

7329
04:31:51,060 --> 04:31:52,160
What do both do at the same time?

7330
04:31:52,420 --> 04:31:53,860
I literally just said that.

7331
04:31:56,180 --> 04:31:57,500
The artichoke said that.

7332
04:31:57,920 --> 04:31:58,740
Okay, go!

7333
04:32:00,660 --> 04:32:01,100
Yeah!

7334
04:32:01,700 --> 04:32:02,620
We did it!

7335
04:32:05,720 --> 04:32:07,340
I love artichoke.

7336
04:32:07,860 --> 04:32:09,760
You love it so much, why don't you marry it?

7337
04:32:14,320 --> 04:32:15,560
What the fuck are you doing?

7338
04:32:16,500 --> 04:32:17,560
I don't know, let's move on.

7339
04:32:19,100 --> 04:32:19,680
Whoa.

7340
04:32:22,480 --> 04:32:23,520
Oh, I...

7341
04:32:23,520 --> 04:32:24,640
What?

7342
04:32:27,540 --> 04:32:32,440
Oh, you have to grab onto the side and then I grab onto you.

7343
04:32:33,140 --> 04:32:33,360
Oh!

7344
04:32:36,660 --> 04:32:38,080
I'm grabbing onto you!

7345
04:32:38,840 --> 04:32:41,200
I'm like on your fucking shoulder.

7346
04:32:41,280 --> 04:32:41,860
I'm like on your fucking shoulder.

7347
04:32:42,040 --> 04:32:42,700
I'm like on your fucking shoulder.

7348
04:32:45,060 --> 04:32:46,900
Don't worry, I can grab onto this one.

7349
04:32:47,540 --> 04:32:48,880
I'm gonna grab onto this one.

7350
04:32:48,920 --> 04:32:49,380
Follow me!

7351
04:32:51,180 --> 04:32:51,860
Follow me!

7352
04:32:52,980 --> 04:32:55,060
It'd be so funny if I let go right now.

7353
04:32:55,300 --> 04:32:57,560
Oh man, I really wanna eat my artichoke.

7354
04:32:58,420 --> 04:32:59,680
It'd be so funny.

7355
04:33:00,600 --> 04:33:01,000
It'd be so funny.

7356
04:33:01,620 --> 04:33:02,020
Alright.

7357
04:33:02,340 --> 04:33:03,440
We gotta go to the...

7358
04:33:03,440 --> 04:33:05,020
Oh, I think we can make it to the next blue.

7359
04:33:05,520 --> 04:33:06,580
I think we can make it.

7360
04:33:06,600 --> 04:33:07,160
We can't make it.

7361
04:33:07,220 --> 04:33:07,960
Gotta go to the red.

7362
04:33:08,180 --> 04:33:09,320
I got it.

7363
04:33:09,320 --> 04:33:10,980
Don't worry, I got you.

7364
04:33:12,560 --> 04:33:14,000
What are you being tough?

7365
04:33:14,380 --> 04:33:15,760
Don't worry, I got you.

7366
04:33:16,600 --> 04:33:18,060
I'm making sure you don't fall.

7367
04:33:18,420 --> 04:33:19,020
I'm making sure you don't fall.

7368
04:33:20,820 --> 04:33:21,740
Incoming gusts!

7369
04:33:22,900 --> 04:33:23,820
Incoming gusts!

7370
04:33:27,360 --> 04:33:28,280
The storm!

7371
04:33:28,820 --> 04:33:29,940
No, get this one!

7372
04:33:30,140 --> 04:33:30,580
Yes!

7373
04:33:31,440 --> 04:33:32,340
I got you!

7374
04:33:34,000 --> 04:33:35,280
I'm holding onto you!

7375
04:33:35,380 --> 04:33:38,300
I'm making sure your boots are digging into the snow right now.

7376
04:33:38,400 --> 04:33:38,900
I'm making sure your boots are digging into the snow right now.

7377
04:33:39,320 --> 04:33:40,520
Shut up!

7378
04:33:44,520 --> 04:33:45,920
What are you doing?

7379
04:33:46,040 --> 04:33:47,120
What are you doing?

7380
04:33:49,660 --> 04:33:51,440
I can't hold the crown!

7381
04:33:53,680 --> 04:33:56,780
Alright, we're good.

7382
04:33:58,280 --> 04:33:59,940
The wind doesn't reach us here.

7383
04:34:00,200 --> 04:34:01,860
There's a cover on the other side, mate!

7384
04:34:02,280 --> 04:34:03,300
What are you doing?

7385
04:34:03,900 --> 04:34:05,040
The wind!

7386
04:34:05,700 --> 04:34:07,340
What are you doing?

7387
04:34:07,540 --> 04:34:09,300
What are you doing?

7388
04:34:09,320 --> 04:34:09,720
What the fuck?

7389
04:34:11,540 --> 04:34:12,540
Does it not stop?

7390
04:34:14,140 --> 04:34:15,280
Oh, I don't think it stops!

7391
04:34:15,600 --> 04:34:16,660
I think we have to go to the right!

7392
04:34:17,180 --> 04:34:18,400
There's a cover on the other side.

7393
04:34:18,560 --> 04:34:18,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7394
04:34:19,020 --> 04:34:19,740
You have to go.

7395
04:34:20,120 --> 04:34:21,440
I just hold onto you.

7396
04:34:24,360 --> 04:34:24,760
Yeah.

7397
04:34:24,920 --> 04:34:25,240
Yeah.

7398
04:34:26,140 --> 04:34:27,320
And then we do this.

7399
04:34:33,220 --> 04:34:33,620
Alright.

7400
04:34:33,900 --> 04:34:35,540
I think we go here?

7401
04:34:35,800 --> 04:34:36,080
I think we go here?

7402
04:34:38,620 --> 04:34:39,260
Yeah.

7403
04:34:41,660 --> 04:34:43,840
Get the fuck off!

7404
04:34:44,280 --> 04:34:49,600
The longer we're here, the longer we play this game!

7405
04:34:50,180 --> 04:34:50,760
Listen.

7406
04:34:51,780 --> 04:34:52,920
That's fine by me.

7407
04:34:53,300 --> 04:34:55,080
Then I'll go backwards.

7408
04:35:00,760 --> 04:35:03,060
I will go all the way down this mountain.

7409
04:35:03,060 --> 04:35:04,000
You think I won't?

7410
04:35:04,000 --> 04:35:06,060
You think I will go all the way down this mountain?

7411
04:35:06,240 --> 04:35:07,100
Cause I will.

7412
04:35:07,320 --> 04:35:09,600
I am that spiteful.

7413
04:35:10,820 --> 04:35:12,860
I'm also that spiteful.

7414
04:35:13,240 --> 04:35:14,240
Good night.

7415
04:35:23,420 --> 04:35:23,980
Well...

7416
04:35:23,980 --> 04:35:25,060
I'm swept away!

7417
04:35:33,060 --> 04:35:34,280
Oh no!

7418
04:35:34,940 --> 04:35:36,980
Just one last push!

7419
04:35:39,500 --> 04:35:41,200
This is wrong!

7420
04:35:41,200 --> 04:35:43,220
Where are you?

7421
04:35:43,380 --> 04:35:45,480
Where the fuck did you go?

7422
04:35:49,500 --> 04:35:50,680
Where the fuck did you go?

7423
04:35:50,780 --> 04:35:53,160
Where the fuck did you go?

7424
04:35:53,840 --> 04:35:54,560
Now!

7425
04:35:55,860 --> 04:35:56,860
Hey!

7426
04:35:56,980 --> 04:35:57,940
Hey!

7427
04:36:01,730 --> 04:36:03,050
I'm losing!

7428
04:36:05,930 --> 04:36:07,590
I'm losing!

7429
04:36:10,450 --> 04:36:11,770
That's looking right.

7430
04:36:11,870 --> 04:36:13,190
I didn't need you.

7431
04:36:14,390 --> 04:36:16,310
I'm already at the next stage!

7432
04:36:17,870 --> 04:36:20,190
Good, I wasn't going to work.

7433
04:36:21,030 --> 04:36:22,650
What the fuck?

7434
04:36:22,890 --> 04:36:24,290
Where even are you?

7435
04:36:24,630 --> 04:36:25,050
I'll wait.

7436
04:36:25,130 --> 04:36:26,090
I'll wait.

7437
04:36:26,810 --> 04:36:28,210
Get over here!

7438
04:36:28,430 --> 04:36:29,390
Grip onto me!

7439
04:36:32,050 --> 04:36:32,730
Huh?

7440
04:36:32,730 --> 04:36:34,230
Oh my god.

7441
04:36:38,330 --> 04:36:39,670
Oh my god.

7442
04:36:39,690 --> 04:36:39,750
Oh my god.

7443
04:36:39,750 --> 04:36:41,310
How the fuck do I get to the other side?

7444
04:36:44,950 --> 04:36:46,170
Get over here!

7445
04:36:48,970 --> 04:36:49,750
Say something.

7446
04:36:49,890 --> 04:36:50,970
I'm losing grip!

7447
04:36:51,430 --> 04:36:51,870
Help!

7448
04:36:51,910 --> 04:36:52,930
I don't need you.

7449
04:36:53,990 --> 04:36:55,270
I don't need you.

7450
04:36:56,410 --> 04:36:58,450
I don't need you.

7451
04:36:58,450 --> 04:36:59,610
Yeah, you do it on your own.

7452
04:36:59,850 --> 04:37:00,150
Yeah, you do it on your own.

7453
04:37:00,150 --> 04:37:00,750
Okay, get over here.

7454
04:37:00,990 --> 04:37:02,190
Okay, okay.

7455
04:37:02,350 --> 04:37:02,810
I need you.

7456
04:37:02,850 --> 04:37:03,330
I need you.

7457
04:37:03,350 --> 04:37:03,690
Get up.

7458
04:37:03,710 --> 04:37:04,150
Get up.

7459
04:37:04,230 --> 04:37:06,210
I'm literally right next to you.

7460
04:37:13,610 --> 04:37:14,650
You fucker.

7461
04:37:14,650 --> 04:37:16,030
I can't even get up here.

7462
04:37:16,890 --> 04:37:20,710
You have to let go because I can't even get up here!

7463
04:37:22,310 --> 04:37:23,090
You have to let go because I can't even get up here!

7464
04:37:25,130 --> 04:37:30,770
You have to let go because I can't even get up here!

7465
04:37:32,990 --> 04:37:35,090
I can't use the magnet!

7466
04:37:36,130 --> 04:37:37,010
I can't use the magnet!

7467
04:37:39,110 --> 04:37:43,870
Hey, I don't know where to go from here.

7468
04:37:46,810 --> 04:37:48,570
Where do we go from here?

7469
04:37:50,390 --> 04:37:52,030
We just... Oh!

7470
04:37:52,410 --> 04:37:53,950
Oh, it's a meat in the middle!

7471
04:37:57,250 --> 04:37:59,170
Okay, I'll go on the other side.

7472
04:37:59,830 --> 04:38:00,890
You stay there.

7473
04:38:04,170 --> 04:38:05,390
Alright, here we go.

7474
04:38:05,850 --> 04:38:06,810
Are you ready?

7475
04:38:09,090 --> 04:38:10,830
Three, two, one, go!

7476
04:38:12,310 --> 04:38:13,290
We did it.

7477
04:38:14,070 --> 04:38:15,710
Through sheer determination.

7478
04:38:15,710 --> 04:38:17,490
We did it.

7479
04:38:18,010 --> 04:38:18,770
It says come!

7480
04:38:20,290 --> 04:38:22,070
This is a healthy marriage.

7481
04:38:22,130 --> 04:38:22,930
Look, it spells come!

7482
04:38:24,390 --> 04:38:27,470
Look, look, look, look!

7483
04:38:28,250 --> 04:38:29,710
I'm not looking.

7484
04:38:29,950 --> 04:38:30,830
I'm not looking.

7485
04:38:30,870 --> 04:38:32,610
I'm closing my eyes.

7486
04:38:33,190 --> 04:38:34,050
Look, look!

7487
04:38:34,190 --> 04:38:34,890
Keep disconnected!

7488
04:38:35,290 --> 04:38:35,850
We made it!

7489
04:38:36,090 --> 04:38:36,530
Yes!

7490
04:38:36,670 --> 04:38:38,190
That was good, Jiwa!

7491
04:38:38,450 --> 04:38:38,830
Yeah!

7492
04:38:40,630 --> 04:38:43,350
See, this is a healthy relationship.

7493
04:38:43,490 --> 04:38:44,810
A healthy marriage.

7494
04:38:48,110 --> 04:38:50,070
My turn to sit here.

7495
04:38:53,800 --> 04:38:55,440
I think we can finish the game.

7496
04:38:56,960 --> 04:38:58,280
No way!

7497
04:38:58,560 --> 04:38:59,620
There's no way!

7498
04:39:01,400 --> 04:39:02,840
There's no way!

7499
04:39:03,680 --> 04:39:04,920
I think we can finish the game.

7500
04:39:05,000 --> 04:39:08,240
Kumi, Kumi, there's two more chapters.

7501
04:39:08,440 --> 04:39:09,080
Kumi.

7502
04:39:19,770 --> 04:39:20,770
Hello, Kazu.

7503
04:39:21,690 --> 04:39:22,350
Focus.

7504
04:39:22,410 --> 04:39:22,910
Focus.

7505
04:39:22,910 --> 04:39:23,090
Focus.

7506
04:39:23,110 --> 04:39:23,290
Oh, pretty.

7507
04:39:24,530 --> 04:39:26,150
The Aurorae Aurealis.

7508
04:39:27,210 --> 04:39:28,650
At this time of day.

7509
04:39:28,690 --> 04:39:28,830
What are you saying?

7510
04:39:29,230 --> 04:39:31,110
The Aurorae Aurealis.

7511
04:39:32,530 --> 04:39:34,410
At this time of day.

7512
04:39:34,570 --> 04:39:35,710
At this hour.

7513
04:39:35,890 --> 04:39:37,310
Right in this very location.

7514
04:39:37,810 --> 04:39:38,450
The snow globe.

7515
04:39:39,810 --> 04:39:41,070
Wait, what was it again?

7516
04:39:41,130 --> 04:39:41,470
The what?

7517
04:39:41,790 --> 04:39:43,190
The Aurorae Aurealis.

7518
04:39:47,470 --> 04:39:48,030
Aurora?

7519
04:39:49,190 --> 04:39:50,310
Aurorae Aurealis.

7520
04:39:50,750 --> 04:39:51,310
Really?

7521
04:39:55,250 --> 04:39:57,970
How you forgot your whole speech.

7522
04:39:59,090 --> 04:40:01,230
It was the worst proposal in the history of the world.

7523
04:40:01,230 --> 04:40:02,490
Wait, I proposed to you here?

7524
04:40:02,750 --> 04:40:03,170
I thought you proposed here?

7525
04:40:03,410 --> 04:40:04,730
Yeah, I proposed here.

7526
04:40:04,950 --> 04:40:05,890
Look at the memories.

7527
04:40:08,170 --> 04:40:10,450
Who's the way you handled it?

7528
04:40:11,330 --> 04:40:13,650
Without trying to hide how scared you were.

7529
04:40:14,050 --> 04:40:14,270
Without trying to hide how scared you were.

7530
04:40:15,310 --> 04:40:16,330
It was brave.

7531
04:40:17,310 --> 04:40:18,510
I'm a brave boy.

7532
04:40:19,470 --> 04:40:20,230
I'm a brave boy.

7533
04:40:20,230 --> 04:40:21,770
Mama said I'm a brave boy.

7534
04:40:22,010 --> 04:40:22,290
Mama said I'm a brave boy.

7535
04:40:23,450 --> 04:40:25,510
Why do you keep talking?

7536
04:40:29,230 --> 04:40:30,630
Why do you keep talking?

7537
04:40:31,110 --> 04:40:31,710
Eww.

7538
04:40:33,450 --> 04:40:35,290
Bro, he ruined the moment.

7539
04:40:35,850 --> 04:40:37,030
You're making great progress.

7540
04:40:37,510 --> 04:40:38,830
He ruined the moment.

7541
04:40:39,190 --> 04:40:40,590
Are you ready?

7542
04:40:41,210 --> 04:40:42,530
Let's get going.

7543
04:40:42,810 --> 04:40:46,330
I hate seeing his disinfigured tongue in his mouth.

7544
04:40:46,630 --> 04:40:46,910
I hate seeing his disinfigured tongue in his mouth.

7545
04:41:09,930 --> 04:41:11,550
Oh, is the lights working?

7546
04:41:12,030 --> 04:41:12,090
Oh, is the lights working?

7547
04:41:13,530 --> 04:41:14,130
Wow.

7548
04:41:14,130 --> 04:41:14,730
Wow.

7549
04:41:14,730 --> 04:41:15,030
Wow.

7550
04:41:18,180 --> 04:41:20,160
The lights working again.

7551
04:41:21,420 --> 04:41:22,460
Shake it.

7552
04:41:22,480 --> 04:41:23,280
They're still inside.

7553
04:41:24,760 --> 04:41:25,880
Shake it.

7554
04:41:27,900 --> 04:41:29,320
Dad, Dad, look.

7555
04:41:29,460 --> 04:41:30,880
Look at the snow globe.

7556
04:41:31,460 --> 04:41:33,540
You hear the screams in the snow globe.

7557
04:41:34,040 --> 04:41:34,260
You hear the screams in the snow globe.

7558
04:41:37,030 --> 04:41:39,590
Why haven't I ever seen this picture before?

7559
04:41:40,150 --> 04:41:40,270
Why haven't I ever seen this picture before?

7560
04:41:41,090 --> 04:41:42,290
Look, Dad.

7561
04:41:42,630 --> 04:41:47,430
That's when Daddy and Mommy were last happy before I was born.

7562
04:41:47,770 --> 04:41:48,030
That's when Daddy and Mommy were last happy before I was born.

7563
04:41:48,030 --> 04:41:48,610
Haha.

7564
04:41:49,190 --> 04:41:49,430
Haha.

7565
04:41:52,330 --> 04:41:52,970
Aha.

7566
04:41:52,970 --> 04:41:54,850
Letter B's number two.

7567
04:41:54,930 --> 04:41:56,070
Dear Mom and Dad.

7568
04:41:56,870 --> 04:41:57,770
Isn't this exciting?

7569
04:41:58,050 --> 04:41:59,030
Yes, we're thrilled.

7570
04:41:59,370 --> 04:41:59,910
Good.

7571
04:42:00,230 --> 04:42:03,410
Now, how do you find your purpose in life?

7572
04:42:03,730 --> 04:42:03,890
Hm?

7573
04:42:04,690 --> 04:42:05,330
Through...

7574
04:42:05,330 --> 04:42:06,710
Wait for it...

7575
04:42:06,710 --> 04:42:07,370
Passion!

7576
04:42:07,550 --> 04:42:08,130
Oh, God.

7577
04:42:08,570 --> 04:42:09,710
We're going to have sex.

7578
04:42:09,950 --> 04:42:10,450
What?

7579
04:42:12,690 --> 04:42:14,970
Because you've lost your passion, Cody.

7580
04:42:15,410 --> 04:42:19,330
A passion that lights the path to your purpose in life.

7581
04:42:19,630 --> 04:42:21,350
Passion, path, purpose, passion.

7582
04:42:21,510 --> 04:42:22,210
You know, huh?

7583
04:42:22,390 --> 04:42:23,410
Uh, no.

7584
04:42:24,470 --> 04:42:27,070
Maybe he's talking about you wanting to be a gardener.

7585
04:42:27,310 --> 04:42:28,610
Yeah, it's about gardening.

7586
04:42:29,290 --> 04:42:30,450
God, Kumi.

7587
04:42:30,910 --> 04:42:31,690
You can't be moved here.

7588
04:42:31,710 --> 04:42:32,510
It was about gardening.

7589
04:42:36,370 --> 04:42:38,150
I'm going to rake your garden.

7590
04:42:38,890 --> 04:42:39,410
What?

7591
04:42:39,890 --> 04:42:40,410
I'm going to rake your garden.

7592
04:42:40,830 --> 04:42:41,310
And...

7593
04:42:45,060 --> 04:42:48,480
I never really seemed to appreciate what I did.

7594
04:42:48,860 --> 04:42:50,520
Oh, so now it's my fault.

7595
04:42:50,820 --> 04:42:52,940
You see, this is why we can't live together.

7596
04:42:53,160 --> 04:42:53,580
You see?

7597
04:42:54,040 --> 04:42:55,460
And what did she say?

7598
04:42:55,900 --> 04:42:56,560
Oh, my God.

7599
04:42:56,900 --> 04:42:57,380
God.

7600
04:42:57,520 --> 04:42:59,160
Spread the seeds!

7601
04:43:03,820 --> 04:43:05,820
Who said I had zero risk?

7602
04:43:05,820 --> 04:43:06,380
Come on.

7603
04:43:07,060 --> 04:43:08,960
Even though I stole that from Chad.

7604
04:43:16,720 --> 04:43:18,500
I have garden riz.

7605
04:43:20,100 --> 04:43:21,240
Oh my god, it's my garden!

7606
04:43:21,360 --> 04:43:22,880
I told you I'm going to rake the garden!

7607
04:43:23,320 --> 04:43:24,640
The actual garden.

7608
04:43:24,640 --> 04:43:28,620
Oh yeah, but everything still looks... beautiful.

7609
04:43:30,220 --> 04:43:33,900
And all thanks to my painstaking groundwork, I might add.

7610
04:43:34,200 --> 04:43:35,360
Oh, really?

7611
04:43:36,600 --> 04:43:38,240
Painstaking groundwork, huh?

7612
04:43:38,400 --> 04:43:39,200
Look at this!

7613
04:43:39,360 --> 04:43:39,840
Come on!

7614
04:43:40,500 --> 04:43:43,220
Cousin, did you want to trade in the blanket with me?

7615
04:43:43,580 --> 04:43:43,980
Yeah!

7616
04:43:44,820 --> 04:43:45,940
Use your head!

7617
04:43:46,080 --> 04:43:48,200
And you will understand soon enough!

7618
04:43:48,320 --> 04:43:48,980
My head?

7619
04:43:49,180 --> 04:43:49,660
Yeah!

7620
04:43:50,400 --> 04:43:51,000
Woah!

7621
04:43:52,080 --> 04:43:52,680
Eww!

7622
04:43:53,040 --> 04:43:53,920
What the fuck?

7623
04:43:55,000 --> 04:43:56,320
Oh, that's fucking gross!

7624
04:43:59,320 --> 04:43:59,880
No!

7625
04:44:00,640 --> 04:44:01,960
Support God Passion!

7626
04:44:03,060 --> 04:44:04,140
Wait, what is that?

7627
04:44:06,300 --> 04:44:08,120
I think it's a weed killer.

7628
04:44:08,880 --> 04:44:10,620
Alright, we're calling here, right?

7629
04:44:10,840 --> 04:44:11,640
That was...

7630
04:44:13,860 --> 04:44:15,280
We can finish this next week.

7631
04:44:15,740 --> 04:44:17,320
There's still three more chapters.

7632
04:44:20,420 --> 04:44:23,280
You know, I'm happy to end it here.

7633
04:44:23,280 --> 04:44:25,220
Cause I ended up with my nice garden Riz.

7634
04:44:26,100 --> 04:44:26,920
Say ah.

7635
04:44:27,500 --> 04:44:29,040
What the fuck?!

7636
04:44:29,040 --> 04:44:30,020
No!

7637
04:44:30,260 --> 04:44:31,200
Say ah!

7638
04:44:31,640 --> 04:44:32,200
Noooo!

7639
04:44:33,640 --> 04:44:34,200
Ahhhh!

7640
04:44:34,860 --> 04:44:35,120
Noooo!

7641
04:44:35,120 --> 04:44:35,500
Say ahh!

7642
04:44:36,100 --> 04:44:36,660
Noooo!

7643
04:44:37,060 --> 04:44:38,460
Get away from me!

7644
04:44:38,700 --> 04:44:39,260
Say ah!

7645
04:44:39,260 --> 04:44:40,620
Get away from me!

7646
04:44:41,400 --> 04:44:43,100
What the fuck is that?

7647
04:44:44,300 --> 04:44:44,860
Noo!

7648
04:44:45,000 --> 04:44:45,560
Stop!

7649
04:44:46,200 --> 04:44:47,980
What is that?

7650
04:44:48,460 --> 04:44:49,280
Say ahh.

7651
04:44:49,880 --> 04:44:50,520
I don't want to.

7652
04:44:50,580 --> 04:44:51,300
I don't want to!

7653
04:44:51,400 --> 04:44:52,040
I don't want to!

7654
04:44:52,200 --> 04:44:53,180
I don't want to!

7655
04:44:53,260 --> 04:44:54,540
I don't wanna!

7656
04:45:00,480 --> 04:45:04,260
Oh my god!

7657
04:45:07,320 --> 04:45:09,380
We'll finish this next week.

7658
04:45:11,040 --> 04:45:13,180
Oh my god, what a journey.

7659
04:45:13,320 --> 04:45:16,400
I feel like I aged so much.

7660
04:45:19,020 --> 04:45:21,460
Because we have a very loving relationship.

7661
04:45:24,500 --> 04:45:28,880
Every second spent with you is like...

7662
04:45:31,060 --> 04:45:32,880
is like a miracle.

7663
04:45:37,080 --> 04:45:39,680
Why do you keep saying these?

7664
04:45:39,740 --> 04:45:41,020
What do you mean?

7665
04:45:42,100 --> 04:45:42,920
Why?

7666
04:45:44,000 --> 04:45:45,120
I'm rising!

7667
04:45:45,560 --> 04:45:46,240
I'm rising!

7668
04:45:46,480 --> 04:45:47,020
Is it working?

7669
04:45:48,840 --> 04:45:50,160
Is it working?

7670
04:45:50,600 --> 04:45:51,720
Is it working?

7671
04:45:53,300 --> 04:45:54,360
Is it?

7672
04:45:54,620 --> 04:45:55,260
Alright.

7673
04:45:55,940 --> 04:45:59,900
Are you gonna be taking a nap or are you gonna play...

7674
04:45:59,900 --> 04:46:01,880
What are you gonna play?

7675
04:46:02,240 --> 04:46:02,960
TFT?

7676
04:46:03,420 --> 04:46:07,620
I think I might log on Minecraft a little.

7677
04:46:07,740 --> 04:46:08,360
Minecraft?

7678
04:46:09,040 --> 04:46:12,420
See what's going on and then TFT.

7679
04:46:13,340 --> 04:46:13,780
Alright.

7680
04:46:15,180 --> 04:46:18,260
Have fun Minecrafting!

7681
04:46:20,060 --> 04:46:21,160
Have fun!

7682
04:46:21,160 --> 04:46:21,840
Maybe I'll take a nap.

7683
04:46:23,260 --> 04:46:25,260
Alright, I'll see you later then.

7684
04:46:25,980 --> 04:46:27,520
Alright, I'll message you.

7685
04:46:27,700 --> 04:46:28,660
Alright, bye bye!

7686
04:46:30,180 --> 04:46:30,700
Bye bye.

7687
04:46:30,960 --> 04:46:31,300
Woah!

7688
04:46:31,860 --> 04:46:32,440
Woah!

7689
04:46:35,400 --> 04:46:39,780
You know it's love when your wife spits at you.

7690
04:46:44,760 --> 04:46:46,660
Alright, I'll see you later.

7691
04:46:49,040 --> 04:46:50,020
Bye bye.

7692
04:46:50,780 --> 04:46:51,580
Bye bye.

7693
04:46:53,500 --> 04:46:54,580
Oh my god.

7694
04:46:54,660 --> 04:46:56,940
What a journey today, chat.

7695
04:46:57,120 --> 04:46:58,480
What a fucking journey.

7696
04:46:58,600 --> 04:47:00,820
Three more chapters left.

7697
04:47:01,520 --> 04:47:02,140
Woah!

7698
04:47:03,580 --> 04:47:04,620
Ah, I'm tired.

7699
04:47:06,580 --> 04:47:07,460
Oh yeah.

7700
04:47:07,720 --> 04:47:10,360
I know that I updates, updates, updates.

7701
04:47:10,640 --> 04:47:13,720
Apparently Challenger Circuit has been delayed.

7702
04:47:13,920 --> 04:47:16,660
There was an update regarding Challenger Circuit.

7703
04:47:17,060 --> 04:47:20,780
So, most likely I might take Saturday as a rest day.

7704
04:47:21,320 --> 04:47:22,880
So, uh...

7705
04:47:23,260 --> 04:47:25,120
Saturday might be a rest day then.

7706
04:47:25,200 --> 04:47:32,940
Because I decided to use it as a day to just rest up a little bit and recoup some energy.

7707
04:47:33,400 --> 04:47:35,020
So, that's gonna be delayed.

7708
04:47:35,180 --> 04:47:36,660
It's delayed to like April?

7709
04:47:36,880 --> 04:47:37,580
I think?

7710
04:47:39,160 --> 04:47:40,280
April 6th.

7711
04:47:40,280 --> 04:47:40,560
Yeah.

7712
04:47:41,060 --> 04:47:44,600
It's gonna be delayed to April 6th.

7713
04:47:44,680 --> 04:47:48,940
They're moving around the schedule to fit the other tournament that got delayed.

7714
04:47:49,240 --> 04:47:51,320
So there's a lot of stuff that's being moved around.

7715
04:47:51,720 --> 04:47:53,240
So that's why... that's why...

7716
04:47:53,260 --> 04:47:55,620
That shit is... that got moved.

7717
04:47:56,360 --> 04:47:56,920
Um...

7718
04:47:58,360 --> 04:47:59,160
And... uh...

7719
04:47:59,160 --> 04:47:59,700
What else?

7720
04:47:59,820 --> 04:48:00,180
What else?

7721
04:48:00,740 --> 04:48:01,300
Uh...

7722
04:48:01,300 --> 04:48:05,080
Uh... Next week, I know I said I wanted to play Dead Rising next week.

7723
04:48:05,200 --> 04:48:06,480
To start Dead Rising playthrough.

7724
04:48:06,840 --> 04:48:09,960
But then I remembered Dead Rising is majority escort missions.

7725
04:48:10,420 --> 04:48:15,320
And then like I already went through a lot of escort missions with Resident Evil.

7726
04:48:16,140 --> 04:48:16,700
So...

7727
04:48:17,100 --> 04:48:18,700
So I decided...

7728
04:48:18,700 --> 04:48:21,840
I decided that we're gonna play a different game.

7729
04:48:21,960 --> 04:48:23,240
We're gonna start a different game.

7730
04:48:23,260 --> 04:48:24,600
Next week.

7731
04:48:25,880 --> 04:48:29,060
Because I want a little break from doing escort missions.

7732
04:48:29,560 --> 04:48:32,620
So those are the updates for today.

7733
04:48:33,340 --> 04:48:34,480
I'm gonna call it here.

7734
04:48:34,760 --> 04:48:36,960
Um... Because I do have a lot of behind the scenes to work on.

7735
04:48:37,040 --> 04:48:38,540
As well as preparing for tomorrow's stream.

7736
04:48:38,740 --> 04:48:41,820
So I... unfortunately there will be no disaster on the chat reading.

7737
04:48:42,120 --> 04:48:43,920
But thank you all for coming.

7738
04:48:44,080 --> 04:48:46,340
I hope you guys enjoyed part two of It Takes Two.

7739
04:48:46,520 --> 04:48:48,540
As always everybody stay hydrated.

7740
04:48:48,840 --> 04:48:49,380
Pause to check.

7741
04:48:49,480 --> 04:48:51,340
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7742
04:48:51,400 --> 04:48:53,160
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

7743
04:48:53,260 --> 04:48:54,540
Because you deserve it.

7744
04:48:54,560 --> 04:48:55,700
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

7745
04:48:56,040 --> 04:48:56,820
Bye guys.

7746
04:48:57,340 --> 04:48:57,820
Bye!
