00:01:48,170 --> 00:02:58,730
hello everybody if i sound dead inside it's because i literally i i woke up like 10 minutes ago so i'm not okay right now i i'm not okay at the moment um so yes um i messed up i i fucked up so slept for the member stream um for those who were not there during the member stream um i accidentally woke up at 12 55 and then the stream was at 12 30 and it's not because i i went to bed late the first time i explained this in the membership but for the first time um in five days i actually went to bed at two in the morning which is pretty early for me because during the break I accidentally fucked up my sleep schedule because I was like oh my god I don't have to stream tomorrow that means I can stay up as long and I like it's 8 a.m.

2
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,390
it's 8 a.m.

3
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,170
oh my god it's 8 a.m.

4
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:14,170
so that was that was that's what happened the last couple of days and

5
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,210
And then sometimes, and we're feeling a little extra silly, sometimes it's 10 in the morning.

6
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,510
I'm like, yay!

7
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,630
So yesterday, I was like, oh my god, it's true, Samara.

8
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,670
I need to go to bed early.

9
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:41,750
So I actually went to bed at 2 in the morning, and then I woke up at 10 a.m.

10
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,270
At 10 a.m.

11
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:44,930
today.

12
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,730
And I ate some really good food from one of my pre-cooked meals.

13
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,770
It was like buttered salmon with rice.

14
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,530
It was so good.

15
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,890
At that time, I was like, I was feeling the food coma hitting me.

16
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,570
And I was like, I still have an hour before the stream.

17
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,990
It's 11 a.m.

18
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,110
It'll be fine.

19
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,410
It'll be okay.

20
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,570
I still have one hour.

21
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,830
A little bit of nap.

22
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,830
You have the water to anyone?

23
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,210
And then I overslept.

24
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,170
I woke up and I slept through two of my alarm.

25
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:32,030
And I was like, And then my manager called me like a minute after I woke.

26
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,930
I was like, why didn't you call me?

27
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,590
Like, that's what day?

28
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,730
Like, I didn't know you were awake.

29
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,070
It was a member stream.

30
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,490
Like, because he wasn't membered.

31
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,210
He was.

32
00:04:45,430 --> 00:05:02,350
He's not membered to me because he's like I'm not I'm not using my money to member you So he was so he didn't know I wasn't streaming just because it's because he wasn't membered to me

33
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:12,570
He's like you pay me I don't have to pay use my the money you pay me to member to you

34
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:48,690
okay um um so so so he didn't he didn't know until like after when he saw people were like we're so cute he got in the discord servers apparently he's like where is she and then he called me and i was like i was like i'm already i'm like i know i know i'm awake now i'm awake Because I was so messed up and I was,

35
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,230
I wish, I wish you can like target gift people, uh, memberships.

36
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,850
I feel like that.

37
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,170
Like you already have membership.

38
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,110
I feel like target gifting would be in the next best step.

39
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:06,670
But anyway, anyway, I was so messed up that I did accidentally go live on Twitch because I forgot the last stream I did before I went on a break was on Twitch.

40
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,590
So I accidentally went live on Twitch.

41
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,550
I was like, oh fuck.

42
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,950
The bot's deleted though.

43
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,730
It's deleted.

44
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,310
It's like it never happened.

45
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:21,490
It never fucking happened before I went live again on members.

46
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,690
But anyway, anyway.

47
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,330
So after the, also for those who are members and was like, oh, where is she?

48
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,890
And then went back to sleep because you guys thought I wasn't going to show up.

49
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,630
Because I did show up like 35 minutes later.

50
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,330
I'm really sad.

51
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,250
We're having another member stream again next week.

52
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,490
Same time slot.

53
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,770
Third time's the charm.

54
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,750
I would do it until I wake up in time for it.

55
00:06:51,930 --> 00:07:00,530
It would keep going until I wake up, until I wake up, until I get it right.

56
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,030
Same time slot.

57
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,510
We will do it until it works.

58
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,250
Surely, third time's the charm.

59
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,450
It's going to be at 1230 again for those who are wondering.

60
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,590
Um, I fell in love.

61
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,390
They give the five.

62
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,250
Give the ships.

63
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,730
Thank you.

64
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,730
Thank you.

65
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,770
Um, anyway, also, after the memory stream, I was so very tired.

66
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,270
I don't know.

67
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,630
I think I'm just, my body was just not used to.

68
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,690
I fucked up.

69
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,670
I accidentally changed my sleep schedule.

70
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,730
I fucked up.

71
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,930
My body's not used to waking up so early anywhere.

72
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,330
So my body was like, no, you need to sleep more.

73
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,050
And so I was like, surely it won't hurt.

74
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,730
Surely it won't hurt to sleep a little bit asleep again mr.

75
00:07:51,130 --> 00:08:12,630
broken by thank you for the five gift the ships thank you thank you because i during the rest week um i was waking up at like three to five p.m like it bounced between those two so like my body was like it's not ready yet you're not it's like you know waiting for the fruit to get right like turn i guess like from green,

76
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,710
the yellow, and you're farming.

77
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,590
Like, it's not ready yet, so he's got it.

78
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,270
You're not yellow yet.

79
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,230

83
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,230
The sleeping habits improve.

86
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,710
I did sleep a lot during the rest week.

87
00:08:39,930 --> 00:09:12,910
Just not the right kind of sleep being just not the right time slots i i messed up so um so yeah so i took an hour and a half nap again because i'm like it'll be different this time around i mean you know with the amount of practice i've been having napping surely i get more used to it right like the more you practice the better you get but it's just not still the same it's it was not different i it was definitely different guys.

88
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,490
I was so dead.

89
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,530
I was so dead inside.

90
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,290
I still am.

91
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:26,430
I woke up like, I looked at my phone.

92
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,750
I was like, like, 5, 5, 30.

93
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,410
And I'm like, I can stay in bed for 15 more minutes.

94
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,590

It was so long ago What did we do this anyway?

109
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,350
I don't remember.

110
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,070
It was even...

111
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,370
It was even before.

112
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,370
Like...

113
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,270

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,210
That was how...

116
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,570

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,630
That was how... Before I even prep for my birthday concert too, guys.

118
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,250
That was...

119
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:43,770

120
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,350
to be fair, I've done so many of these, so it's like, what do I ask people to do?

121
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:59,210
You know, like, you know, I like, I've done so many, like, oh, do a pose stuff, but I always want to do something new.

122
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,090
So, so I'm like, what, I was like, dower dog, that's like the only thing you think of.

123
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,790
I was like, yeah, I'm give the people what they want.

124
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:22,410
I want it so I can fit as many things as possible too because you know we're like limited time slots Just like just do it like we don't need any introduction here.

125
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,830
We know who I am.

126
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,530
We don't really need any Introduction here.

127
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,750
Let's just do it so we can use my time slot efficiently.

128
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:38,130
Um No, we don't need filler give the people what they want.

129
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:38,890

I feel like, do you guys think I could complete the game by next week?

134
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,910
Um, do you think I have like two parts left?

135
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,010
Because I think I could get to act three today and maybe play a little bit of act three.

136
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,910
I know act three is harder.

137
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,190
I don't even know what I have left to do.

138
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,710
Um, I don't, I honestly don't know what I have left to do.

139
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:49,010
Um, Yeah, there's no way I'm completing it today, because I haven't even got to Act 3.

140
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,830
I don't even know how many...

141
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,350
I forgot.

142
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,850
I hope someone's been keeping track, because I don't even know how many I've left.

143
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,150
But I also farmed a little bit of money off stream, too.

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:09,550
Gotta do this Open this on us Tokeybird, right?

158
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,690
Give us a super chat.

159
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,150
Thank you.

160
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:11,850
Thank you.

161
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,210
Boom.

162
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,370
Oh, there's more people now.

163
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,190
He doesn't want to talk to me, but I'm going to do this.

164
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,130
Yay.

165
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,850
Wish granted.

166
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,590
Yay.

167
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,570
More money.

168
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,290
Okay, I completed all of it.

169
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,830
I don't even...

170
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,190
Oh, wait.

171
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,810
Where's the merch?

172
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,230
That's weird.

173
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,030
Where is he?

174
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,670
All right.

175
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,810
You keep all the helping you and start inspiring it to others.

176
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,770
Best you think serious about what effect you might be coming.

177
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,650
Too much help could prove a dangerous thing.

178
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,310
Especially for all these bugs.

179
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,810
Starved for so long.

180
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,810
Look, they're so hungry.

181
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,190
Just like you guys.

182
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,730
You're so... We were like, don't you please feed us.

183
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,670
And I'm like, what?

184
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,830
Where is the merchant, anyway?

185
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,670
Oh, wait, my tools.

186
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,170
I forgot.

187
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,950
You're right.

188
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,470
All my stuff were, like, money-earning tools.

189
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,350
I was like, oh, shit.

190
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:35,950
Thank God.

191
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,550
I thank God he has told me.

192
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,950
They were my money-farming tools.

193
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,570
We gotta get the compass.

194
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,030
Oops.

195
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,170
Oh my gosh, what am I doing?

196
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,470
I'm too tired.

197
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,670
I'm so tired.

198
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,990
That's the farming, dude.

199
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,830
I'm meant to do a Jackal post next time.

200
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,910
I'm thinking it was Super Chatside.

201
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,210
Thank you.

202
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:03,570
Thank you.

203
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:13,270
Thing is, I remember being in a 3D debut where we've requested Jackal post.

204
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,690
So that's why I didn't request that.

205
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,230
Because that's been done before.

206
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,730
Like, I need something new and refreshing.

207
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,850
Oh, you have the witchcraft?

208
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,990
No, I have the hunter.

209
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,370
I'm pretty sure.

210
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,510
Yeah, see?

211
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,830
It's the hunter.

212
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,290
And it's the third store.

213
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,850
Yeah, I mean, to be fair, that war dog is literally the jackal pose.

214
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,950
If you think about it.

215
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,710
It literally is.

216
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,090
Except the legs are spread.

217
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,530
Uh, Yosh, thank you for the super chat.

218
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,070
Thank you, thank you.

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,790
Shrek Kun Zeyornian Whisper Freaky.

220
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,750
Thank you for the super chat.

221
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,310
Thank you, thank you.

222
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,910
Alright, where's the last- What's in the Citadel's Memor- Memorium?

223
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,430
Where the fuck is that?

224
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,430
Memorium?

225
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,230
Whispering Vault's Song Clive.

226
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,750

There's the zoo.

230
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,750
There we go.

231
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,730
I forgot he was there.

232
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,730
Okay, is that his stuff?

233
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,450
Okay, there it is.

234
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,010
Inspect.

235
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,930
Smell that.

236
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,290
Okay.

237
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,730
Oh, it's the same guy.

238
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,430
Why are you going outside?

239
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,070
You already...

240
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,690
You don't need to go outside anymore.

241
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,470
What are you doing?

242
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,410
I'm here to take care of you.

243
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,370
What are you doing?

244
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,610
You're safe now, child.

245
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,190
Why are you still going outside?

246
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,650
Oh my god.

247
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,390
I did that on purpose.

248
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:37,970
Alright.

249
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,330
She just looked.

250
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:39,710
Oh yeah.

251
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,870
That's... Oh my god.

252
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,730
She went back down.

253
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,490
I took a fucking hit for you.

254
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,410
And you went back down?

255
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,590
God damn it.

256
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:47,850
When?

257
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,590
He was like, I need a far more money off of her.

258
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,010
Oh my god.

259
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,910
Where are you going?

260
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,230
Why?

261
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,550
Why are you here?

262
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,050
Why did you have to go there?

263
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,970
Oh my, oh thank god.

264
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,010
She didn't go further.

265
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,530
Oh, thank god.

266
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,470
I was gonna be like really mad.

267
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,250
That is the first step.

268
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,630
Oh, God.

269
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,430
Oh, my God.

270
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:23,790
Please.

271
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,390
Why are you so fast?

272
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,070
I'm just going to wait.

273
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,690
I was like, why work harder?

274
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:30,790
All right.

275
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,530
Oh, my God.

276
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,510
There's more.

277
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,350
Oh, shit.

278
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,850
How is I supposed to know there was more?

279
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,150
Oh.

280
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,870
I thought it was over.

281
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,810
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,730
And of course they do too.

283
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,110
hits.

284
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:47,850
Alright, are you okay?

285
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,030
No, there's more, isn't there?

286
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,150
Oh, it's done.

287
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,130
He was in the wrong neighborhood.

288
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:54,910
Oh, fine.

289
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,950
Thank you, Super Chat.

00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:56,750
Thank you.

292
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,510
Hi, Doki.

00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,050
This is my first time donating to anyone.

294
00:21:59,170 --> 00:21:59,750
I'm glad it's you.

295
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,810
Can you get happy birthday from my Aoshi?

Of course you can!

297
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,410

00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,870
Happy birthday to you.

299
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,150

She's a fucking grandma.

306
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,870
We gotta take her back to her time at home.

307
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,530
There's like those grannies that have fucking escaped.

308
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,950
Now why don't you hurry back to shrine and let them all know what a good job you've done.

309
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,770
There might be a few more goodies to get up on my way back.

310
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,290
I don't need you linger around in the meantime.

311
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,010
Blessings and farewell.

312
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,690
Alright, at least thank God I farmed all this money.

313
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:42,830
Do.

314
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,170
Is there anything here?

315
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,530
Wait, okay, I was gonna say, how do I get back up?

316
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,030
Back to the five.

317
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,830
Alright, this way.

318
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:00,950
Wee!

319
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,030
God, I'm like a little scared.

320
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,550
I'm gonna actually run into something.

321
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,090
Alright, there you go.

322
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,930
Full HP.

323
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,390
Alright, we go back.

324
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,610
Ooh, the five!

325
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,550
Wait, Ashken!

326
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,570
I once forgot about this elevator.

327
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,730
Let's just activate that.

328
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,990
just for just for the sake of it i have so much money i might as well doesn't hurt

329
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:47,850
oh it's just up um let's just get him down here first there you go he he doesn't deserve to live his life ends by my hand there you go it was what fate wanted it's up here There we go.

330
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,530
We got the elevator.

331
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,670
That was like $900.

332
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,250
He was just chilling.

333
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,150
Um, it was self-defense.

334
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,770
Just because he was a child.

335
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,190
Doesn't mean I can't self-defense myself.

336
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,470
God, just like, just like blind people.

337
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,550
If it hit first, I will defend myself.

338
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,950
And him dying is his own fault.

339
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,060
It's not my fault he died.

340
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,940
I dropped kicked him in self-defense.

341
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,680
You should have been so fucking weak.

342
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,180
If he wanted to hit me, he should have been prepared.

343
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,720
He should have known the consequences.

344
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,560
It was a good deed you did up above, dear one.

345
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,420

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,280
But Toki, we got a house to build.

352
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,460
I'm not even gonna be in that house!

353
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,740
It's like my vacation home that I never go on vacation because I'm always working.

354
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,780
I'm always fucking slaving a way to this pilgrims.

355
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,100

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,500
I was like, please, before you kill me, can you sing for me?

359
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,620
Mr. McFluff begins.

360
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,060
Thank you for the super chat.

361
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,360
Thank you, thank you.

362
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,540
Hey, Doki, have you completed the area to the right of the cylinder yet?

363
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,900
Because if not, I have some bad news.

364
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,140
Thank you, the super chat.

365
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,000
Thank you, thank you.

366
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,500
Oh, my God.

367
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,280
Is it the fucking poison swamps?

368
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,140
Is it the poison swamps?

369
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,260
Thank you for the super chat.

370
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:23,620
Thank you.

371
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,380
Thank you.

372
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,440
Yes.

373
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,400
Hey, guys.

374
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:29,640
Thank you.

375
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,840
Thank you.

376
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,640
Hey, can you please react to Tim's DM of the shooting?

377
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,820
She called you out on...

378
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah, I heard about that.

379
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,860
I saw the clip.

380
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,280
But yeah, I didn't read the DM because I've been so stressed out and busy.

381
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,600
So I haven't been replying to people and DMs.

382
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,320
That's why.

383
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,040
My manager went to tell...

384
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,220
Because I was like, what?

385
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,040
What's going on?

386
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,660
because it was my manager that contacted her manager about it.

387
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,620
And then, like, I didn't know.

388
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,160
So then I was like, wait, what's going on?

389
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:12,240
And then, like, my manager apologized to her manager because, like, I wasn't answering any DMs at that time.

390
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,820
Just because I was so...

391
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,100
That's why I needed that break, because I was so overworked and stressed out.

392
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,440
Because when I'm overworked and stressed out, yeah, they set up a play there.

393
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,680
You remember, like, me and Tengen had a playday set up before, like, we became friends?

394
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,240
That's basically what happened.

395
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,200
So, um, so I wasn't answering, like, any messages or DMs from anybody because I was just so exhausted.

396
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,100
Um, um, okay, so I completed two, what do we have to do now, chat?

397
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,240
What do we have to do?

398
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,900
Oh my god, there's two.

399
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,660

We have 37 quests.

403
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,880
I need Shakira.

404
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,660
How many more do I need?

405
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,280
I know.

406
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,380
I don't need all the fleas.

407
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,560
I already got them the move.

408
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,420
I think I got all the Wishwara quests.

409
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:49,940
Did I not?

410
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,500
Oh yeah, I will rip that back to 10 months.

411
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,900
TM soon.

412
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,640
Don't worry, I promise.

413
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,460
So then we can have her eat that shoe.

414
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,430
Alright, now that I'm here.

415
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,310
Why is this bell heart?

416
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,590
Okay, we're gonna go this way.

417
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,040
Bell heart.

418
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,060
I need one more map to lead to another quest.

419
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,440
Okay.

420
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,540
Wait, where does Shakira live?

421
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,280
Where does she live?

422
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,400
Okay, these are just things from my house.

423
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,280
I am Lord.

424
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,160
La la la.

425
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,020
Where does she live?

426
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,420
Top right of Bellheart.

427
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,180
What?

428
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,840
What the fuck does she live?

429
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,460
Nobody here.

430
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,740
Hello?

431
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,940

Okay, there...

434
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,680
She was not here.

435
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,700
Guys, she doesn't live here.

436
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,540
Oh.

437
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,220
Oh, I forgot.

438
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,620
Ring, ring, ring, Shakira.

439
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,440
Oh, shit, Shakira.

440
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,300
Okay, hello.

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,160
You will give you a carrot.

443
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,500
Oh, she doesn't have it.

444
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,420

445
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,160

446
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Chat.

447
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,900
She's like, that's what the bell's for.

448
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,600
What do you think was going to happen?

449
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,300
Yeah, they're in the petrified ducks right now.

450
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,380
Okay, I don't have...

451
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,960
There is one to bio water.

00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,520
Oh my God.

453
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,840
I don't even remember how to get there.

454
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,980
How do we get to the bio water?

455
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,420
What did I do?

456
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,080
I don't remember.

457
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,740
See if we You're all set.

458
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,180
Now you get to have the last map from Shakira and Belhart.

459
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,660
Then go back to Belhart Forest.

460
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,240
The last quest once you get the quest.

461
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,000

Thank you.

You need to my memory.

468
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,880
The fleas to be in the purgified ducks.

469
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,440
You need to do Shakira's quest, which means you need every map.

470
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,140
Alright.

471
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,680
The Sinner's Road.

472
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,900
Okay, here.

473
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,780
Was it here?

474
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,520
How the fuck do I get there?

475
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,120
Sinner's Road?

476
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,320
Like, dear?

477
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:35,940
Dude.

478
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:37,940
Really?

479
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,640
This is where they live?

480
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,020
And then I go up?

481
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,340
Alright.

482
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,480
Time to sin yet again.

483
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,280
This is why I never got raptured.

484
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,980
This is...

485
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,240
This is why.

486
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,100
Uh...

487
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,780
Oh my god, I have to...

488
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,380
Okay, I have to go from gray more.

489
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,380
Gray more up.

490
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Oh my god.

491
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,940
Just back to sinning, I go.

492
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,860
No way.

493
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,340
No, can't help it.

494
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,820
Okay, gray more.

495
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,130
Wait, there was a citadel route, right?

496
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,130
Like, could I've just...

497
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,790
Like, could I've just done it for the...

498
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,690
Citadel route?

499
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,150
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say it.

500
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,150
I did the citadel route.

501
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,230
Why the fuck would I make this harder for myself?

502
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,300
Yeah, from the little secret vault I Wait, this is not the right way.

503
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,240
I'm so lost.

504
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,920
I'm so lost.

505
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,760
I was just like, no, wait, this is not the wrong area.

506
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,940
Alright, it's this way.

507
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,180
I have a map, but yet somehow I'm still lost.

508
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,700
I don't know how.

509
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,880
It's time to go back to hell.

510
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,260
I'm gonna fall a little bit.

511
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,280
Oh shit!

512
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,360
God damn it, I thought that was the way.

513
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,060
Because I was like, why the fuck would it curb?

514
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,960
Alright.

515
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,220
And then...

516
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,200
Where am I?

517
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,960
Oh, fuck.

518
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,100
I'm so lost.

519
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,980
Alright, this way.

520
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,930
It's been a while since we've done this.

521
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,130
Oh, wait, there's...

522
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,390
Okay, elevated.

523
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,370
Wrong way.

524
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,990
How is this the wrong way?

525
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,170
Is this not the way back to sinners road?

526
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,790
Not back to sin?

527
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,810
Wait, how am I the wrong way?

528
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,610
Oh my god, I wish I have a map in the goddamn Oregon.

529
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,810
That's the right, oh my god, go back.

530
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,270
No, I did it, I did it.

531
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,610
Chat, please.

532
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,890
You're pulling me left to right.

533
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,870
Chat, please.

534
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,290
There you go.

535
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,470
Oh, fuck, I thought it was more down.

536
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,940
Okay, now it's down.

537
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,700
Okay, and then we go...

538
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Actually, let's get the chair real quick.

539
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,560
Before we do this.

540
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,320
We...

541
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,480
Okay, and then we go this way.

542
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,700
Oh, go, right?

543
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,860
Once I'm outside?

544
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,680
Oh, now you go right.

545
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Okay.

546
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,820
Why am I here?

547
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,540
Guys, why am I here?

548
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,420
Um...

549
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:59,800

550
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,500
I don't know if you guys know that.

551
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,900
Well, that's where I died too.

552
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,000
But not only did they use maggots.

553
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
But they also...

554
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,340
Not only did they use leeches.

555
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,760
But they also used maggots to eat off the dead skin.

556
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,580
Because they're like, That will help, surely.

557
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,180
That will fix everything.

558
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,380
Keep forgetting what this was like.

559
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,260
I keep forgetting what I had to do to get up here.

560
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,230
It's I gotta get rid of the dead skin anyway.

561
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:39,210
Alright, I don't know if I'll make it now because I sort of brute-force this, but well, let's see.

562
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:40,510
We'll just see.

563
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,330
Oh my god.

564
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,830
It's fine.

565
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,950
Okay, then we just go right side.

566
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,770
Oh my god.

567
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,390
Okay, I'm gonna seal this.

568
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,230
Oh my god, I forgot they do too!

569
00:37:59,610 --> 00:37:59,930
No!

570
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,370
Oh, this is so bad.

571
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,370
Oh, please.

572
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,690
Oh, my God.

573
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,790
This is so bad.

574
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:08,890
Oh.

575
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,530
I forgot.

576
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,790
I went to the bench.

577
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:14,610
No.

578
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,050
I forgot this.

579
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:16,930
No.

580
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,130
It's okay.

581
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,210
I remember what to do.

582
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,470
I remember.

583
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,290
Because I was warm up.

584
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,290
It was warm up, everyone.

585
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,790
I was just warming up, guys.

586
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:29,490
Okay.

587
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,190
It's okay.

588
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:39,250
Now, now, now that I know the pathway, I know the pathway now, so it's fine.

589
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,530
It'll be okay now.

590
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,330
I know where to go.

591
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,530
See it?

592
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,190
Look at that.

593
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,390
So smooth.

594
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,210
So very smooth.

595
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,110
Okay.

596
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,560
There we go.

597
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,000
See, look at that.

598
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,060
So smooth.

599
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,160
I told you guys.

600
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,380
I figured it out.

601
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,420
Okay, now I remember.

602
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,680
Dog is there.

603
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,860
Careful about that dog.

604
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,160
All right.

605
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,760
We just keep going, right?

606
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,220
Just keep on swimming.

607
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,940
You know what they say.

608
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,900
There we go.

609
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,420
See, it's that easy.

610
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,480
It's okay.

611
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,620
We don't need that bench.

612
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,980
it.

613
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,500
Okay.

614
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,740
Guys, we'll be fine.

615
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,240
We don't need the bench.

616
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,820
See, look at that.

617
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,780
We're so okay.

618
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,980
Oh, we're so fine.

619
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,280
What's this?

620
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,680
Excuse me.

621
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,180
Why is he still here?

622
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,480
Oh my god.

623
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,360
I tried to play a song.

624
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,380
It's okay.

625
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,240
We'll just do this.

626
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:03,860
Oh, okay.

627
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:32,540
I thought you'd be like Okay, I knew God damn it, it was the wrong way It was the fucking curse It's the wrong way It's okay, I got a key It's okay I got a key Look, he threatened me with a knife So that means I can also Threaten him with seven knives It's just a way of the law That's how it works Okay,

628
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,620
I got a shard, but...

629
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,920
If he threatens me with one knife, I am legally allowed to throw seven knives at him.

630
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,460
Break the wall?

631
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,260
Which wall?

632
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,520
There were so many walls, guys.

633
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,720
Yeah, be fair.

634
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,580
Oh, where I got the item.

635
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,900
Oh, there it is.

636
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,100
Oh, yeah, there's a little crack.

637
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,620
Okay.

638
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,080
Oh, my God.

639
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,840
There it is.

640
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,300
There's foul water.

641
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,720
Poison swamp, my beloved.

642
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,440
But...

643
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,760
Okay, I gotta make sure they don't roll into the swamp.

644
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,400
I am so sad.

645
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,360
Here we go.

646
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,640
Oh my god.

647
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,660
Oh my god, I should have put the mat.

648
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,300
I should have wore the re- God!

649
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,040
Okay.

650
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,440
What the fuck?

651
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,180
Okay, give me a...

652
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,180
I know there's something over there!

653
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,660
Oh, fuck it.

654
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,600
I'll figure it out later.

655
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,220
Oh, there we go.

656
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,160
Oh, I could have just done this.

657
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,240
Oh, my god.

658
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,640
No, there's so many.

659
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,840
Oh, there's so many.

660
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,640
Oh, there was nothing.

661
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,780
Oh, my god.

662
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,140
Got poison creatures.

663
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,080
Oh, my god.

664
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,040
Oh, my god.

665
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,400
Okay.

666
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,140
Run.

667
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,120
Yeah, I have the anti-magic charm, but I need to get to it.

668
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,380
No!

669
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,080
I need to find a bench first.

670
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,680
I need to get through hell.

671
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,700
Oh my god, please leave me alone.

672
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,940
I paid my taxes.

673
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,080
I deserve better.

674
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,860
Oh my god, because I fucked the course you're here.

675
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,280
I'd pay my government fees.

676
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,800
I don't even know where the bench is.

677
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,360
I know.

678
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
I know fees.

679
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,580
Oh my god!

680
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,520
That's it.

681
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,980
Put chainsaw!

682
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:54,960
Chain saw!

683
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:55,980
Chain saw!

684
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,300
There we go.

685
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:00,940
Oh!

686
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,240
I don't need more of you because I already got the amount I needed, but whatever.

687
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,770
The thing is, technically I don't even need to save him.

688
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,490
Because I already got the required amount.

689
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,750
There was already enough kids that I saved.

690
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,950
Are they all jumping away?

691
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,850
Eventually I'll find the bench.

692
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,630
I just want to get that out of the way.

693
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,540
Jesus, I don't like how they're all like watching.

694
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,660
It's creepy.

695
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,440
Wait, there's something above me.

696
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,840
I'm gonna check that out.

697
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,560
Oh, there he is.

698
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,140
Bro, it's a little creepy that you're just watching me like that.

699
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,400
I don't like it.

700
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,200
Oh, nice.

701
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:57,900
Lucky roll.

702
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
It's my lucky day.

703
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,480
I don't know if I should go up or left.

704
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,100
I can't believe.

705
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:06,720
Hell.

706
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,100
Surprise all.

707
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,120
You'll want to do it.

708
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,200
We'll do it later.

709
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,900
It's not today.

710
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,680
Wait, why did it make me go here?

711
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,920
What is over here?

712
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,440
Oh, but Zian, they give us super chat.

713
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,360
They give us super chat.

714
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,360
Is there anything here?

715
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,280
Or is that just bait?

716
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:27,900
Nothing?

717
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,680
Why the fuck?

718
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,620
Okay, it was just bait.

719
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,410
Oh my god.

720
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:41,610
Get out of here.

721
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:43,970
At least I got enough.

722
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:44,630
What the fuck?

723
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,810
Wait, there's nothing here.

724
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,990
It was just all bait.

725
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,130
Oh, wait, he lives.

726
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,330
Okay, this was literally just here for...

727
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,130
Oh, my God.

728
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,450
No, don't do this to me.

729
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:56,870
All right.

730
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,230
Oh, my God.

731
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,010
No!

732
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,630
Oh, my God.

733
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,270
There's Shakira.

734
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:10,330
There she is.

739
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,790
She doesn't have a chair.

740
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,470
She doesn't have a chair Your shell is ridden with those gruesome maggots.

741
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,030
It was a foolish choice of yours.

742
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:50,690

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,440
Down left.

760
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,380

Alright, here we go.

766
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:14,620
Oh, wait.

767
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,340
There's a station.

768
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:15,940
Oh, my God.

769
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,880
Wait, there's a station.

770
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,920
Oh, my God.

771
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,080
There is hope.

772
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,060
Get out of here.

773
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:24,960
That's right.

774
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,600
Get your ass out of here.

775
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,560
Alright, we go this way.

776
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,820
And then we go down.

777
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,200
And then we go down.

778
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,320
And we still go down.

779
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,780
That's pretty cool, huh?

780
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,680
No.

781
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,320
You can't tell.

782
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,220
This place has not been maintained in a long ass time.

783
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,980
Is this where the tram station is?

784
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,060
Why the fuck did the tram station, okay, too far down?

785
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,520
Yeah, I was gonna say, where the fuck is the tram station?

786
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,960
Oh, there it is.

787
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,860
Oh my god, there we go.

788
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,320
I knew getting the money was a good idea.

789
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,500
Is this the bench?

790
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,340
What is this?

791
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:12,720

792
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,060

793
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,060

794
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,080
Yeah, this is the tram.

00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,080

Thank God I farmed off stream.

799
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,420
Look at that.

800
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,640

00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,340

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,840
I really want jolly bees.

805
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,400
I love jolly bees.

806
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,860

807
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,160

I am lord.

811
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,340
La la la.

812
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,100
What?

813
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,410
She took away the bell.

814
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,030
Wait, how about...

815
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,690
Oh, it's on the quest board.

816
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,650
Okay, I'm gonna be like, how do I like it?

817
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,350
Tell her to get over it.

818
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,290
Okay, child wielding needle.

819
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,130
I've caught fresh scent on my master in those stricken swamps.

820
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,210
Besides, ask you now to follow me.

821
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,090
Alright, time to go through the swamp.

822
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,690
And then she was like, enough.

823
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:18,050
I revoke your privilege to ring the bell.

824
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,450
Best boss fight in the game coming up in that area.

825
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:22,870
Yes, it is required.

826
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,810
I don't know if you're lying to me.

827
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,290
That's the thing.

828
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,450
It's not what everyone likes to say.

829
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,150
They'll be like, no, it's definitely required.

830
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,110
And then I find out it's not.

831
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:40,850
Guys, not even like guys, bosses you want me to fight doesn't mean it's required.

832
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,350
That's all I'm saying.

833
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,010
Okay.

834
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,890
We don't need a poison.

835
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,550
It is required.

836
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:57,470
Alright.

837
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,130
I'm gonna fix the map.

838
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,510
Get rid of all of these.

839
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:06,510
Okay, where do we go?

840
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:07,550
Do we just go up?

841
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,890
It actually is required.

842
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,230
Okay, I'll choose.

843
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,670
to believe, you guys.

844
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,830
I'll choose to hope.

845
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,770
Yeah, it is required for me.

846
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,390
We're going up, up, up in the moment.

847
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:34,350
Bada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada.

848
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,830
Oh, wait, this is not the right area.

849
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:38,950
You know what's funny?

850
00:51:39,050 --> 00:52:11,350
For those who don't know, Fortnite, announced the collab with um kpop demon hunter with no jam tracks like the whole the whole movie oh my god it's fine i don't have maggots anyway the whole movie is about singing but they didn't even include any of the music other than for the um other than for uh one of the what was it the the shield thing which i thought was hilarious because i was like the whole it's a fucking musical but yet you can't jam to it yeah Yeah,

851
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:12,890
none of the songs are...

852
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,310
Only Golden is in the...

853
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,250
Only Golden is in the...

854
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,430
Is in Fortnite.

855
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:21,470
Oh, he's not...

856
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,590
She's not here anymore.

857
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,470
And no skins.

858
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,350
They don't deserve skins.

859
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,070
The guys don't...

860
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,830
Alright.

861
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,210
Other than the main evil bad guy.

862
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:32,270
Like...

863
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,510
The other male characters have like no sustenance.

864
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,650
They're literally...

865
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,190
Holy shit.

866
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:40,930
Like...

867
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,670
They're not even characters.

868
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:47,230
Oh, there it is.

869
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,530
What?

870
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:56,370
But I just thought it was so funny that...

871
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,070
Oh my god, where is she going?

872
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:06,610
That the only song they have in there was Golden, and it's when you use an item in the game to access it.

873
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:10,910
You're just jealous that they're...

874
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:11,530
Popular.

875
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,730
Wait, what was her bad name again?

876
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,230
I don't even remember.

877
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,510
Saja Boys, yeah.

878
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,630
You're just a Saja Boy anti.

879
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:22,810
You're a hater.

880
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,330
You're right.

881
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:29,550
You're so right.

882
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,890
Jesus, these guys are very annoying.

883
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,170
Oh my god!

884
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,890
What?

885
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:49,670
It did so much damage.

886
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:50,890
It freaked me out.

887
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:58,450

Okay, now I remember.

890
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,570
They were just called them K-pop demon hunters.

891
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,910
I need to reload.

892
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,420
That's how little I pay attention.

893
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,700
Like, it was a good movie.

894
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,360
I think I'm the one of the rare people that only watched it once.

895
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:58,140
I mean, I listened to the songs, like, several times, but, like, I don't think I listened to them enough to...

896
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,260
enough compared to the others.

897
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:08,200
I already forgot how to get there Yeah

898
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:37,490

900
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,090
It's actually crazy.

901
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,850
Like they got mad.

902
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,390
Am I going the right way?

903
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:50,170
Sand.

904
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:50,690
Yeah, sorry.

905
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:51,810
The K-pop stands.

906
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:57,670
Yeah, they got mad at K-pop demon hunters because you're like, oh man, it's actually crazy.

907
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,990
You're like, uh, oh my god.

908
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,810
Oh my god, I'm so scared.

909
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,390
I'm actually, oh my god, in time.

910
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,150
Thank god.

911
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:05,470
Okay.

912
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:11,230
They were like, Where is the bench, by the way, before I...

913
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,190
I'm so scared.

914
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:13,730
I need to know where's the bench.

915
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:20,850
Because they're like, how dare these virtual...

916
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:24,030
It's like, you know, like they're like, oh, they're virtual.

917
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:24,650
They're not real.

918
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,810
You know, like the whole YouTuber argument delay.

919
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,270
How dare...

920
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,970
Up left?

921
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,970
Oh, they're like, how dare...

922
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:35,850
They're not even real.

923
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,810
How dare they hit number one?

924
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,350
They're replacing my...

925
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:43,950
Jesus Christ.

926
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:44,530
I hate these guys.

927
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:45,850
I hate these guys so much.

928
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:51,850
Replacing, like, real talent.

929
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:55,630
I'm like, what?

930
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,090
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

931
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,190
But that's only for the crazy stands.

932
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:05,290
Because obviously not all K-pop stands are like that.

933
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,660
People were just like, don't trust the bed, the sand.

934
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,440
Yeah, but the real people still sang that song.

935
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,100
So, like, a lot of K-pop stands don't like K-pop Demon Hunter, which is fucking crazy.

936
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:34,380
I mean, to be fair, K-pop Demon Hunter is, like, unrealistic portrayal of K-pop in general.

937
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,060
Because I'm like, there's no way they let these girls eat that much.

938
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,880
I'm just like, I know that's really fucked up for me to say.

939
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,220
You know, it's true.

940
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,880
I was like, damn.

941
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,500
That manager is too nice.

942
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,280
Also, the manager being so nice, too.

943
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,520
Is it real?

944
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:15,640
I don't know.

945
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:16,760
Oh.

946
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:18,960
Uh-huh.

947
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,490
Guys, it wasn't real.

948
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,580
I had a feeling it was never real.

949
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,180
That's why you guys all kept telling me go to the bench.

950
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,620
I knew it wasn't real.

951
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,620
I knew I should never hope in this world.

952
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,120
Now it's on- okay, where is Shakira?

953
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,080
Where is Shakira?

954
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,330
Is it up top?

955
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,490
Wait, where...

956
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,870
How did I get up top?

957
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,590
Go back down and right?

958
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,510
You see that thing up there?

959
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:20,990
How the fuck do I get that?

960
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,850
Is there no way to get up there?

961
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,570
Oh, I have to go right.

962
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:33,330
Oh my god, that fucking hits me.

963
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:35,810
Life is so cruel.

964
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,970
Nero, thank you.

965
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,430
It was a super chat-thinking thing.

966
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,150
Yeah, also the fact that the manager is that nice and...

967
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:48,810
That's crazy.

968
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:54,910
And also the fact that like the fans are okay, but what's her name?

969
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:55,310
Rooney?

970
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,710
Oh my god, fuck you!

971
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,090
You know, they're- oh my god, I'm too so distracted.

972
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:09,530
You know how Rooney- there was like that moment where like, you're- the fans are like, oh my god, I totally ship you with...

973
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:15,590
um oh my god i'm going in here with zero hp i'm

974
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:38,210

975
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:43,930
Open map.

976
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,030
I am opening map.

977
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,770
I'm opening.

978
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:48,850
Oh my god.

979
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,190
Oh my god.

980
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:50,550
Oh!

981
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:51,970
It explodes!

982
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,310
It fucking explodes.

983
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,050
Of course it explodes.

984
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,580
I forgot that it explodes, guys.

985
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,670
Okay, now I need to remember how to get back there.

986
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:16,950
Okay.

987
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,350
It explodes.

988
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:23,390
Yeah, life likes to play funny tricks on you sometimes.

989
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:25,750
Oh my god.

990
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,090
Get out of here!

991
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,530
Please, leave me alone!

992
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:31,930
Leave me alone!

993
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,170
There we go.

994
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,670
I'm enjoying my run back right now.

995
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:49,010
Other than that, Those are my- It's not supposed to be realistic because they are hunting demons, but I was just like...

996
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,870
I just thought, like, that's funny.

997
01:01:56,390 --> 01:02:00,470
It's like the idealized version of what they want K-pop to be like.

998
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,850
K-pop stands will always scare me.

999
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:14,670
Let's see if...

1000
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:16,450
Am I going the right?

1001
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,110
Wait, okay, it's the right side.

1002
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:22,830
Okay.

1003
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,750
Alright, let's see.

1004
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,220
Go this way.

1005
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:37,840
Wait, I don't...

1006
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,520
Oh, it's up and up.

1007
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,860
Oh my god, please.

1008
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:48,580
Alright.

1009
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:49,880
Up we go.

1010
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:51,640
And then up we go.

1011
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,200
then.

1012
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,060
And then guess what, guys?

1013
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,520
We still keep going up.

1014
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,380
Oh my god, I went the wrong.

1015
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,360
It's the wrong up.

1016
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,180
And then we go left.

1017
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,620
We go left.

1018
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
And then I have to go through this hell again.

1019
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,060
Oh my god!

1020
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:10,800
What?

1021
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:11,820
That's it.

1022
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,400
I'm swimming.

1023
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,460
That's it.

1024
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:16,240
You win.

1025
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,260
I'll just swim.

1026
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,960
You fucking!

1027
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:42,920

01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,540
Okay, who needs money anyway, guys?

1029
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,740
Who needs it?

1030
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,960
Oh my, it's fine.

1031
01:03:59,380 --> 01:03:59,940
That's fine.

1032
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,520
I can take a little more.

1033
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,420
It's fine.

1034
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,820
Yes, I might not have money anymore.

1035
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,700
But I already spent...

1036
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,160
I already spent all the money.

1037
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:10,940
It's okay.

1038
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,880
Oh, come on.

1039
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,380
Not okay.

1040
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,900
I'm actually not okay.

1041
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,560
I fucked up.

1042
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,200
There you go.

1043
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,180
Okay, what do you say?

1044
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,160
Uh, Jokia, don't like seeing you suffer.

1045
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:34,260
There's a chair wildly close to the end, and you can get your cocoon back with the stuff where I'm seeing you in the super chat, Odin.

1046
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:42,380
Then you think, like, at the end of this area, where I died, is that it?

1047
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,660
This is the place where I died?

1048
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,420
The very unfortunate place.

1049
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,860
I hate this area.

1050
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,340
This is why I kept this last.

1051
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:03,580
Okay.

1052
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,600
That's fine.

1053
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,740
The bottom right corner of that room?

1054
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,260
What room here?

1055
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,200
Is that... Is that... I swear to God.

1056
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,360
Is that where the chair is?

1057
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,460
I swear to fucking God.

1058
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:20,400

1059
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:20,760

01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,250

1092

Okay, just want me sure.

01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,560
Okay, and then...

1098
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,560
Okay, it's up top.

1099
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,000
There you go.

1100
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,160
And then it was this way.

1101
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,140
Okay, he should have died from that, too.

1102
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,800
Alright, tracking time.

1103
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:36,920
Alright, Shakira.

1104
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,760
I'm coming for you.

1105
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,640
Don't worry.

1106
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:42,180
I'll be your hero.

1107
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,140
Oh my.

1108
01:11:45,160 --> 01:12:18,820
God please I know you didn't ask for it but I'm gonna do it anyway oh my god I have to do this jump again wait there's something here oh she just goes that way but where where does this way go is this where oh what's over here oh my god what's over here though I'm oh my god it's just more traps Is something special?

1109
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:19,560
Alright, I leave.

1110
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,520
Every time you say that, I don't trust it.

1111
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:33,620
Because I think my definition of special is different from your definition of what special is.

1112
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,440
Oh?

1113
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:41,920
Shakira?

1114
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,500
Did you hear that Zootopia 2 is coming up?

1115
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,280
Ole ole?

1116
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:48,920
Shakira?

1117
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,880
Are you excited?

1118
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,640
Oh, hey, it's...

1119
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,720
Oh, hey, look, I'm getting a shower, too.

1120
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,120
Oh, it's your master.

1121
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,580
She looks very alive.

1122
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,440
Oh, Shanka, Hornet.

1123
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,300
Really, needle.

1124
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,260
But that is your name, isn't it not?

1125
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,760
I've heard it spoken in this land with reverence.

1126
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,580
I hope you would accept my summon in these moments.

1127
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,960
One is good, but two is best.

1128
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:30,580
That's fine.

1129
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,480
Oh, not denying that wish, Shakira.

1130
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,700
A somber ceremony seemed likely at this trail's end.

1131
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,700
And I am sadly proved correct.

1132
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:39,480
The Sten is your master?

1133
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,040
The fiercest of my tribe.

1134
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,320
Here she lies.

1135
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,400
I called her master true, but she was mother just as much.

1136
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,880
More by far than a bug who bore me.

1137
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:57,540
Among the many marvels of this kingdom, she found a fine place to meet her end.

1138
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,560
Ended by age.

1139
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,440
My tribe will call that chief.

1140
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,560
How dare she live a happy and fulfilling life?

1141
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:11,540
If I try it, if I see Yoni's training, unbeaten.

1142
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:16,300
Even as a shallow betrayer, she walks this kingdom of breath.

1143
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,240
Does her trail fall that allow me to share witness to its dignity?

1144
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,020
Yes, she's not going to fall, hallowed now.

1145
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,840
You two have journeyed these many paths as my master before us.

1146
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,940
Join me now for a song sending.

1147
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:33,840
Yonusha.

1148
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,960
For shame.

1149
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:37,640
Die young.

1150
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,900
Live fast and die young, apparently.

1151
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,880
Yeah, I was gonna say, she died undefeated.

1152
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:48,840
Is that not what you want?

1153
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,540
I feel like that's a greater honor.

1154
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:05,690
Wish granted.

1155
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:13,670
For sharing this moment, I shall have you accept the gift, one I had believed I would never pass.

1156
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:17,010
You take these rings and the learnings to make more.

1157
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:24,030
There are belts of a clever method devised by my master, and will crush hard this kingdom's toughest shell.

1158
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:26,650
Use them, and she is remembered.

1159
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:28,910
My thanks, Shakira.

1160
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:32,530
Gain a tool so defined by its owner, I am much grateful.

1161
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,750
They shall prove a great aid on my own journey.

1162
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:36,530
Yay!

1163
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:37,750
Oh, I got her throwing wings.

1164
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:38,510
rings.

1165
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:39,890
Oh, I heard that.

1166
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,170
Oh, I can't flip it.

1167
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:42,450
Okay, I did it.

1168
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:43,310
Is that it?

1169
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:46,010
Is that everything?

1170
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:51,230
I recommend finishing bywater sooner than later.

1171
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:52,210
The top part?

1172
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:52,670
Okay.

1173
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:56,350
I don't even know technically how to get which part.

1174
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:57,310
This part?

1175
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:01,410
Wait, but how do I like this part?

1176
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:02,650
How do I even get there?

1177
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:04,870
Yeah, it has a special taunt.

1178
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:06,670
I just realized you can taunt in this game.

1179
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:07,750
See?

1180
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:12,030
that's me like saying fuck you and silk star

1181
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:41,000
more than and then the one who brought down so many characters in this yeah everybody here has like mommy and daddy issues but like i'm not surprised because like in bug world like usually you know the bug when the mom the mom usually gets eaten by its children or like um or like they just abandoned them so i'm not surprised that they all have mommy and daddy issues.

1182
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:42,840
Because that's the way of the bug.

1183
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,140
It's a bug's life, exactly.

1184
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,320
So how do we get to up here?

1185
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:04,620
It's the circle of life.

1186
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,480
Oh, just go left.

1187
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,520
Oh, here, right?

1188
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:15,540
A little intermission that I took earlier.

1189
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:18,600
Oh.

1190
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,960
A fucking course.

1191
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,480
A fucking course that hits me still.

1192
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,700
I want to grab this for extra silk later.

1193
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,420
God, I hate this world.

1194
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,320
Zoom this way?

1195
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,780
Oh, there it is.

1196
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,300
Where the fuck do I get to the fleas?

1197
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:51,880
Wait, did I miss the flea?

1198
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:57,490
Oh my god.

1199
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:00,670
Did I miss the fleet?

1200
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:04,130
But what about the fleet?

1201
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,370
Do we not care about...

1202
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:08,370
Oh!

1203
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:10,570
It's in the secret room.

1204
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:12,230
Are you guys taking me to a boss fight?

1205
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,790
I'm not okay.

1206
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,050

So how do I get the fleet?

1209
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,240
Up a bit and then left.

1210
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,860
Don't worry, this is...

1211
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:16,360
I don't know.

1212
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,800
I feel like I don't believe you guys.

1213
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,260
Top, left, and room above?

1214
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:23,920
What?

1215
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,170
Outside.

1216
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:35,470
Okay, we're gonna look at the map together.

1217
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,030
Guys, okay.

1218
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:37,690
Where?

1219
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:40,450
Where is it?

1220
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:42,630
Let's look at this together.

1221
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:45,430
Leave bench area, then go left.

1222
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,910
Okay.

1223
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:46,910
Like here?

1224
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:47,730
Or here?

1225
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:49,850
One or two?

1226
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:00,870
Two?

1227
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,730
Here.

1228
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:08,380
Okay.

1229
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,920
Right of two.

1230
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,020
Here?

1231
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,280
Here.

1232
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,140
I know, but it's secret.

1233
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,660
It's a secret area!

1234
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:25,420
One.

1235
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,960
Okay, one, two.

1236
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,180
One.

1237
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:32,780
Okay.

1238
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,320
Because I see the fleet.

1239
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,420
I just know it's a secret area.

1240
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:44,480
So I need to remember nowhere to access it in the secret area.

1241
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:49,630
Oh my god.

1242
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,890
Oh my god, I hate all of you.

1243
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,030
You guys all don't deserve to live.

1244
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,230
Oh my god, there it is.

1245
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,190
Oh my god, a fucking chorus.

1246
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,450
Get out of here.

1247
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,050
Oh!

1248
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:09,970
Alright, I freed him.

1249
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:11,270
I freed the child.

1250
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:16,590
Oh my, oh my god.

1251
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:17,910
Get me out of here.

1252
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:19,910
Get me out of this personal hell.

1253
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:25,510
I remember how to...

1254
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,990
I don't remember.

1255
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:28,510
a bumper.

1256
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:31,870
Try to remember how to get there.

1257
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:33,790
I'm running in circles.

1258
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:36,670
I'm activating every fucking trap.

1259
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,230
Oh my god.

1260
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:44,470
Of course it falls down.

1261
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:45,550
Oh my god.

1262
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:47,470
Fucking course he came back.

1263
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:51,130
Wait, why the fuck?

1264
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:54,490
Oh my god.

1265
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:55,310
It's to the right.

1266
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:56,410
I'm so stupid.

1267
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:57,830
I'm...

1268
01:21:58,010 --> 01:21:59,510
Oh my god.

1269
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:02,530
I'm so stupid.

1270
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:05,330
I didn't realize I had to go right.

1271
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,270
It just all blurs together.

1272
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,950
Everything looks the same in this world.

1273
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:11,730
In bio water.

1274
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:15,430
It truly is the poison swamp.

1275
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,770
It all looks the same.

1276
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,460
Oh my god, I'm really missing one more hit.

1277
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,020

1282
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,740
I'm going in with 0 HP, too.

1283
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,340
This fucking sucks.

1284
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,380
That's fine.

1285
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,340
It can take what I don't have anymore.

1286
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,320
Oh my god, why did I go here?

1287
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,860
Why did I go here, too?

1288
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,970
What is wrong with me?

1289
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,880
Surely this path would be easier.

1290
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:54,760
Alright.

1291
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,000
We...

1292
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,780
Just flying over as much as I can.

1293
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,520
Alright, back to hell, I guess.

1294
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:15,330
Alright.

1295
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,580

01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:11,480

Okay.

1314
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:35,660
Where's the other guy?

1316
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,920
Oh shit.

1317
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,600
Oh my god, I used it all.

1318
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,240
My reef, my reef fish broke.

1319
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,760
Oh, fucking curse.

1320
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,880
I was

1321
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,660
like, this is too easy.

1322
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,060
This is too easy.

Thank you.

1324
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,180
A fucking curse there was more.

1325
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,380
I had a feeling.

1326
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:23,700
Oh, there you go.

1327
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:24,540
There goes.

1328
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:25,820
There we go.

1329
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,400
I'm about to have such a good...

1330
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,300
It's like, I...

1331
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:36,860
Okay, I shouldn't have died there, but I was just not okay anymore.

1332
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,760
I want you guys to know I was...

1333
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,260
I was not okay anymore.

1334
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,340
I was like...

1335
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,320
I was like...

1336
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:50,740
this is over for me.

1337
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,700
I don't care.

1338
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,540
I don't know what to use.

1339
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,040
Are you a string shard?

1340
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,360
Alright.

1341
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:08,360
Because I have to do the gauntlet again, right?

1342
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,800
Okay, let me...

1343
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:17,100
I'm not comfortable enough to get rid of my compass to do this run back.

1344
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,940
Okay, I'll change it.

1345
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,500
I'm actually, I'm not comfortable enough.

1346
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:49,460
Um, I mean, I can try.

1347
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,040
I'll try.

1348
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,060
Oops, not that.

1349
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:52,980
What did I get rid of?

1350
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:53,900
Oh, this one.

1351
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,160
I'll try.

1352
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,460
We'll try it.

1353
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,400
Slow and steady.

1354
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,100
Slow and steady.

1355
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,000
Oh my god.

1356
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,360
Absolutely hell.

1357
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:35,010

1358

1359
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,500
Like, these fuckers alone.

1360
01:28:58,180 --> 01:28:59,940
I'm not okay right now.

1361
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:05,220
Alright, if I die again, I'll change my crest, because I'm not okay about this.

1362
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:11,530
Oh, my God.

1363
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:11,970
I hate you.

1364
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:12,950
I hate you so much.

1365
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,190
I am mine.

1366
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:16,830
I wasn't even supposed to get it that way.

1367
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:19,110
I went too far.

1368
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:27,180
It's like, yeah, I'm already broke.

1369
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:28,380
Cat.

1370
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,920
You would have just taken nothing from me.

1371
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:37,470
That's fine.

1372
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:40,130
I already have nothing in my name.

1373
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:45,840
Oh.

1374
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,040
Hello.

1382
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:11,740
Oh my god, someone please stop them.

01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,280
The grippers.

1399
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,920
And then we get...

1400
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,420
Okay, we can only have one tool.

1401
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,500
And I'm just gonna use... I'm gonna try this.

1402
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:19,020
Ah!

1403
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:20,640
Maybe boomerang?

1404
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,760
We'll try boomerang.

1405
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,080
And then...

1406
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:27,260
There we go.

1407
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,940
Equip that lawn claw.

1408
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,220
Wait, I have one more slot.

1409
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,880
I forgot about that.

1410
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,640
Wait, no, we don't need that.

1411
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,160
Okay, now we just have an extra thing that we don't fucking...

1412
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,060
I don't fucking care.

1413
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,520
The long claw.

1414
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,500
We need a long claw.

1415
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,200
But what about the maggots?

1416
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:48,400
I like the quick heal.

1417
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,440
The quick heal has been...

1418
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,260
It's fine.

1419
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,640
We'll do the quick heal.

1420
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,040
We'll try this.

1421
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:58,200
The quick heal has...

1422
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,640
came in clutch way too many times for me.

1423
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
We'll be fine.

1424
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,620
We'll be so safe.

1425
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:10,100
Don't worry.

1426
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:10,960
Trust me.

1427
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,680
Oh my god, that felt a lot easier now.

1428
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,320
I didn't like to do this before.

1429
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:19,840
All right, here we go.

1430
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:22,160
All right.

1431
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,960
Don't worry, we're fine.

1432
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,980
Okay, starting now.

1433
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:35,680
Starting, starting now.

1434
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:37,400
We're fine.

1435
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,180
Look, something happened to me.

1436
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:42,720
Okay.

1437
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,420
Oh my god, I didn't even see this guy.

1438
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:53,220
Starting now.

1439
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:56,780
It's now.

1440
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,460
This is when things will be okay.

1441
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:02,880
See?

1442
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,440
Starting, I told you.

1443
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,340
Starting now.

1444
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,520
I could just run past this.

1445
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,560
Fuck it.

1446
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,240
Just run past it.

1447
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:20,540
Alright.

1448
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,400
We made it.

1449
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:25,560
I think this run back fucking sucks, but we made it.

1450
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:27,360
We fucking made it.

1451
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,380
Okay, there we go.

1452
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,000
We got one.

1453
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,840
Are you fucking kidding me?

1454
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:43,040
There we go.

1455
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:43,920
We got two.

1456
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,280
Okay, there we go.

1457
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,280
Okay, that felt...

1458
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:53,880
That definitely felt a lot easier.

1459
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,280
I'm not gonna lie!

1460
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,480
There we go.

1461
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:05,940
Oh my god, I almost forgot about this.

1462
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:11,030
Oh!

1463
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:12,290
You know what?

1464
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,790
Okay.

1465
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:18,870
Oh my god, you're right, my raid has already broke, almost broken.

1466
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,830
Whoopsie.

1467
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,910
Ah!

1468
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:29,630
Get away from me!

1469
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:31,210
Please!

1470
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:39,130
The fact that I have to do this and then fight that boss is tilting.

1471
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:43,190
Come on, this is worth it.

1472
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:49,190
Okay, that's fine.

1473
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:53,430
When... okay, I heard there is a trick to this.

1474
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:55,490
And I'm gonna abuse it.

1475
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:59,690
I remember, I saw a video of this fight.

1476
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,690
Because they like...

1477
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:05,210
This is worth it.

1478
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,230
I remember now.

1479
01:35:08,530 --> 01:35:09,350
I was like, wait, I remember.

1480
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:10,690
I saw a video of this.

1481
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:14,250
Okay.

1482
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:16,290
Eat me!

1483
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:18,950
Give me, give me my silk!

1484
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:20,370
Give me my silk!

1485
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:24,530
That's okay, right?

1486
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,170
That won't touch me, right?

1487
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:30,790
Oh shit, he doesn't want to...

1488
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:32,810
He's like, you know what, maybe not.

1489
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:38,290
Oh god, oh god, okay.

1490
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:39,390
Four!

1491
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:42,570
Oh my god, he doesn't like the taste, apparently.

1492
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:45,410
Okay, now you can eat me.

1493
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:47,630
That's right!

1494
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:51,670
Oh shit, he's mad!

1495
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:53,110
Oh shit, what?

1496
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:53,850
Oh!

1497
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:30,050
I was like what the fuck was that I don't taste that bad I thought I was pretty nutritious bugs are very good for nutritious value why would he spit me out like that or eat me bro I don't understand I thought I That was very nutritious for that Mia.

1498
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:33,490
He cast fireball.

1499
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,970
Yeah, why does he have a sword?

1500
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:40,250
We all know they don't have swords.

1501
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:42,950
Magic users don't have swords.

1502
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:44,530
That's fucking weird.

1503
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:51,980
Oh my god, used my luck on you as one guy.

1504
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,820
Very good use of my lucky roll.

1505
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:01,180
There you go.

1506
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,100
Oh my god, they regenerate?

1507
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,280
Wait, what the fuck?

1508
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,300
I didn't know that.

1509
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:12,140
Where did he come from?

1510
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:14,920
Okay, there you go.

1511
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,460
Thank you for the rain, Meryl.

1512
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,400
Thank you, thank you.

1513
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,800
We have a good stream.

1514
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,480
Thank you, fucker.

1515
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,220
Okay, thank you so much.

1516
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,700
Like this, I'm just grabbing.

1517
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:27,840
Okay.

1518
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:28,960
Are you serious?

1519
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:29,900
Where did he come from?

1520
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,020
Where did all these guys come from?

1521
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,920
Oh my god, that's so far up too.

1522
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:44,480
Oh my god, I'm fucking cursed.

1523
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:52,260
Oh my god, please.

1524
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:54,420
There we go.

1525
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,500
We got one of them.

1526
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,000
I know I got to just stand underneath them.

1527
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,020
There we go.

1528
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:06,690
It's fine.

1529
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:07,290
It's fine.

1530
01:38:08,530 --> 01:38:08,970
One.

1531
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:15,030
There are three hits, so it's okay.

1532
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:23,120
Okay, that's a waste on my reef, but I'm also like, I don't care.

1533
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,220
I don't care.

1534
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,420
Jesus Christ, I hate these guys so much.

1535
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:34,220
Oh, wow.

1536
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:35,100
Oh, wow.

1537
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:35,560
It's fine.

1538
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,060
It's fine.

1539
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:38,620
Getting the lucky road here, I'm okay with.

1540
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,600
I'm honestly okay with that.

1541
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,020
Alright, nice.

1542
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,040
Nice three hits.

1543
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:47,980
Can't catch me.

1544
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:50,120
I'm in the corner.

1545
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,280
Can't catch me.

1546
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:01,000
It's fine.

1547
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,440
Jesus Christ.

1548
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:06,280
It's not fine.

1549
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,200
Oh, it's fine.

1550
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:09,940
It's fine.

1551
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,580
It's so fine.

1552
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,800
There we go.

1553
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:17,440
All right.

1554
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,660
It's time for war.

1555
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:19,960
It's war time.

1556
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:25,040
Oh, I thought I could like...

1557
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,140
Oh, what?

1558
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,960
Are you serious?

1559
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,420
Are you...

1560
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:34,360
Ah, dang it!

1561
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,100
What happened before?

1562
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,600
Oh my god, he knows.

1563
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,060
He knows my plan.

1564
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:41,620
He knows.

1565
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,020
He knows.

1566
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,000
He won't give me the satisfaction.

1567
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,300
Oh, there we go.

1568
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:48,180
There we go.

1569
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,000
Give me out of here.

1570
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:57,380
There we go He was like I won't give you the satisfaction Oh shit

I forgot to get there.

1579
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:57,520
I have to take...

1580
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,440
I have to swim.

1581
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,140
What did we learn?

1582
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,520
Absolutely nothing.

1583
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:05,280
It wins.

1584
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,580
Thank you for the super chat.

1585
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:07,060
Thank you.

1586
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:07,780
Thank you.

1587
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:13,400
Apparently I didn't learn my lesson at all.

1588
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:15,760
There we go.

1589
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,420
Oh, didn't matter.

1590
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:26,720
There we go.

1591
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:27,900
He's having to get...

1592
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:30,820
Oh my god, I thought I was already there.

1593
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,100
Because, of course, of course it's not that...

1594
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:39,880
There we go.

1595
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,080
It's okay.

1596
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,460
It's fine.

1597
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:51,870
Alright.

1598
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:54,670
I just gotta make sure that he doesn't show up.

1599
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:56,310
Woo-hoo!

1600
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:58,430
Dodged.

1601
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:00,730
Alright, back to hell.

1602
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:03,750
Grab...

1603
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:04,630
Oh my god.

1604
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:07,010
I'll get the maggots off me first.

1605
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:12,500
Okay, I know it's three hits.

1606
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:17,740
Shaw.

1607
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,500
How dare you say Shaw.

1608
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,500
In my presence.

1609
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:26,200
Oh.

1610
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,260
There we go.

1611
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:47,810
I'm just through forcing him so I'm so over these guys there you go here we go

1612
01:42:54,150 --> 01:43:04,410
oh yes stay in the corner that is my strat the most clever of strats in this in this game.

1613
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:07,850
Surely staying in the corner won't hurt me, right?

1614
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:10,910
Shadame!

1615
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:16,490
Don't worry, the corner will never do me wrong.

1616
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:19,790
The corner strat never fails, guys.

1617
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:20,770
Right?

1618
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:25,670
It'll be fine.

1619
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:27,490
Oh my god, it'll be fine.

1620
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:29,210
Oh my god!

1621
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,950
We're fine starting now, Isaac.

1622
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:34,650
Charlemagne.

1623
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:40,970
Okay.

1624
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:43,030
I live in this is my corner.

1625
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:44,930
It's a very nice corner.

1626
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:48,390
Alright, surely he'll...

1627
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:49,590
Okay.

1628
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,390
Yeah, I got one hit.

1629
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:55,370
Do you guys see that?

1630
01:43:55,530 --> 01:43:56,330
The one hit?

1631
01:43:57,490 --> 01:43:59,450
Ah, you fucker!

1632
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:01,830
Oh, already?

1633
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:03,010
Oh my!

1634
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:03,750
What?

1635
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:08,060
Nice, okay.

1636
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:08,780
That's fine.

1637
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:19,450
Oh my god, how did he do so much?

1638
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:20,370
Oh my god!

1639
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:23,470
We know for me!

1640
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:32,850
Guys, it was not a good idea to just stand in front and like just take it off.

1641
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:35,210
And he took it clearly.

1642
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:42,870
Okay, I found out that it might not have been a good idea to like just let him do that.

1643
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:46,370
That might have been a little bit of a mistake.

1644
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:48,270
But now I know.

1645
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:49,570
Now I know.

1646
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:55,210
I learned from my mistake.

1647
01:44:56,170 --> 01:44:57,430
See, guys, I can learn.

1648
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:58,530
Oh, shit!

1649
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:01,210
I can learn.

1650
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:05,030
Like I said, I can learn, surprisingly.

1651
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:08,990
Okay, this is a risk I'll take.

1652
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:11,430
There we go.

1653
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:13,850
I swear to God, am I...

1654
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:40,630
died in his stomach i swear to god this was the risk i was willing to take we did it we did it everyone oh oh door open did we not oh chair oh hey nice oh we free the voice chat works Who would have thought?

1655
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:44,410
Oh my god, this area fucking sucked.

1656
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:49,150
Alright, back to...

1657
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:51,010
Back to this one.

1658
01:45:51,150 --> 01:45:52,750
We go.

1659
01:45:54,010 --> 01:45:55,770
Higher risk, higher reward.

1660
01:45:56,090 --> 01:45:57,110
Not trapped!

1661
01:45:58,370 --> 01:46:00,730
Alright, get this shit out of here.

1662
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:02,490
Give me back my poison.

1663
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:07,880
Alright, we're fine.

1664
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,580
Yeah, we did it.

1665
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:14,100
Alright, so this guy was part of the main quest, right?

1666
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,600
I got the Seeker Soul.

1667
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:18,600
What is that?

1668
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:21,060
Oh, was it bad that I broke that?

1669
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:22,840
It was broken when I was already here.

1670
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:26,440
It was, I swear to God.

1671
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:29,500
It was already broken.

1672
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:35,990
Was that Snail's corpse?

1673
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:37,130
I didn't even notice.

1674
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:41,210
Alright.

1675
01:46:43,090 --> 01:46:43,650
Oh!

1676
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:46,030
Oh, now we're here.

1677
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:48,550
I was, like, wondering how we could get to this area.

1678
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:52,660
Wait, what?

1679
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,880
Where is this place?

1680
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:58,860
Oh, putrefied ducks.

1681
01:46:59,020 --> 01:46:59,620
Oh, okay.

1682
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,020
Oh, that's not dad.

1683
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,360
That's someone else's dog.

1684
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:04,360
That's parking.

1685
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:08,820
There's two dogs barking outside my apartment right now.

1686
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:11,100
Not my dog.

1687
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:13,540
Not my dog, not my problem.

1688
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,780
But where do I go from here?

1689
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,640
Back to the song claim?

1690
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:25,640
Anyway, I'll get rid of these.

1691
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:31,840
They're like, okay, Preachified Ducks is the fastest, right?

1692
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:33,040
Yeah, it is.

1693
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:39,840
Alright.

1694
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,380
I was trying to see which way was fastest.

1695
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:45,920
Get out of this hellhole.

1696
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,120
I can't believe I...

1697
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:48,420
Oh!

1698
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:49,220
Oh wait, I need to...

1699
01:47:49,240 --> 01:48:23,540
needed to wait what oh no it's right side I did not I forgot all about these fuckers wait where the fuck is the is it not here oh it is I just thought it was a wall you will not be missed nope it's this way it's cool that I left that area last truly was hell going through that trauma oh my got you again.

1700
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,500
There we go.

1701
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:31,360
There is justice in this world.

1702
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:40,660
By the way, that whole boss fight and upper bywater was skippable with what the fuck do you mean?

1703
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:42,760
What the fuck is vault vessel?

1704
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,620
What this?

1705
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:46,780
How is this skippable?

1706
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,940
What the fuck do you mean?

1707
01:48:50,200 --> 01:49:19,120
Mr. McLaughlin can say you in a super chat thank you thank you what does that even mean do you skip something like this hey where do we go again sorry the the shock of it learning it was skippable threw me off oh it's technically a bug oh it's a sequence break

1708
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:27,590
Okay, so I have to go to the grand bell wave.

1709
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:30,350
I don't think it was super chat.

1710
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:30,690
Thank you.

1711
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:31,170
Thank you.

1712
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:32,430
Boar's chat works.

1713
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:34,630
Alright.

1714
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:37,190
This way.

1715
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,340
Don't play with my heart like that.

1716
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,040
I don't know why they're barking.

1717
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,720
Maybe they don't like my stream.

1718
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:56,580
Send her.

1719
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:57,660
Thank you for the super chat.

1720
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:58,060
Thank you.

1721
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:58,900
Thank you.

1722
01:49:59,440 --> 01:49:59,980
Oh my god.

1723
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:00,480
How long?

1724
01:50:00,620 --> 01:51:06,960
your name yet i didn't realize your name could get that long oh yes what is it don't think i ain't seen it seen it bell ringer a whole lot of helping you've been up to both here and down below so strange a mantle you're taking for yourself seeing all of them bugs saved and wishes promised find it strange sir i found some solace in the service and the rewards received have proven a boon in my journey not a miss i but in your place now is it i see well what you are weaver and more it's below your sister station we know calm and short men for caring on this low flow just because i'm royalty dosh i mean i don't care i gotta look after my people you know i could say the same for you who still chooses to remain caled we continue to pose as only a simple pilgrim don't you think it's past time you cease your performance leave off old one permit a bug their small disguise it's been a pleasant thing to play simple and I weren't calling for a change even if you seemed insistent on bringing it

1725
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:42,240
change was unavoidable sir whether I arrived or not the monarch stares his threads stretched far my presence only accelerated the inevitable so what you're hoping for a planning the usurp that perch above us all as queen fill up your our hopes only to string us all in your own beastly web such is the way of the weavers and gods of both but i already spoke what do i do i spoke to him but he doesn't care he just was like all right what did i get

1726
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:59,440
this what do i do oh talk to him what i do you and her who waits up there that feeding meaning won't hold forever ready to make your play the else one ruler and her place.

1727
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:00,920
Anath did not.

1728
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,040
Some part of me desires the outcome.

1729
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:04,960
Oh, damn!

1730
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:07,120
She's a domi-mommy.

1731
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:10,600
Darnas, it seems, is baked deep in my blood.

1732
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:12,900
I still no doubt for the one up top.

1733
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:18,340
And yet another part resists, a part over time I find myself siding with, more.

1734
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,860
That part wishes not to claim a monarch's mantle.

1735
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:28,460
Rather, it would see my freedom regained, and this kingdom's bug unshackled from their pale chains.

1736
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:59,840
remarkable idea you're speaking there bell ringer a world cut free not a wish i've had much cause to hope on serious like i ain't so surprised to hear you speak it for all you're helping i've been seeing you clear still got the monarch in you all right and the glare of a weaver or the ambition that's wild different from both if you have already guessed to my desire sir or share aid in the conflict to come?

1737
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:02,020
I, maybe, yes.

1738
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,700
I can barely tell it.

1739
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,940
But there is an idea.

1740
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:10,940
One rare disgust for fear of her up there sensing the score.

1741
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:13,960
You conceived a method, I take it.

1742
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:16,220
A way to see a monarch removed.

1743
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:21,120
It made me left free from claiming her station.

1744
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:24,800
We have me and what remains of my family.

1745
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:28,640
It's a trap of a sort beyond the skill of the Citadel.

1746
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:31,300
One to go further than just her binding.

1747
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:34,820
You'd be just a hunter to set it if you dare enough to try.

1748
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:36,400
Alright, we got it.

1749
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:40,600
Damn.

1750
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:43,960
No wonder all her mates died.

1751
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,340
She sucked the soul out of them.

1752
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,040
Grab me your aid, sir.

1753
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:54,760
If your trap provides a path to freedom, both for myself and your lands of bug, I may indeed choose to trigger it.

1754
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:58,040
What work do you require of me now to see that your service may be?

1755
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:01,740
That's my family's strength you'll need to be seeking, Bellringer.

1756
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:04,380
Us three old bugs still alive.

1757
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:06,240
Spread cross the kingdom.

1758
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:10,660
And one poor cousin dead and drained in swamps choked rotten.

1759
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:12,360
Each has power.

1760
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:14,900
Raw, savage stuff for you.

1761
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:16,440
They'll give it.

1762
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:21,060
If for their sad fascination at the act or the thrill of deviance.

1763
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:23,640
Or because they have no choice at all.

1764
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:25,580
And last, as the base.

1765
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:28,180
Seek a weak weapon of weaver's past.

1766
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:59,220
should still be one left down there in their largest nest a snare and a set an old runo searing silk our own trap will be woven typed about it okay okay what do we okay silk we got the seeker soul hermit soul maiden soul will it show on my map okay it doesn't show on my map that's not good he doesn't know that I destroyed his corpse.

1767
01:54:59,480 --> 01:54:59,640
It's fine.

1768
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,200
Oh my god.

1769
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,680
Of course, there's a fleet.

1770
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:02,600
I forgot here.

1771
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:04,860
Okay.

1772
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:06,520
Where does he say it is?

1773
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:07,620
Oh, Sabo.

1774
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:10,460
Um.

1775
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,020
Down in the moss lands.

1776
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:15,700
Where the fuck is she, though?

1777
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,020
Is it a bone grave?

1778
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,460
Where is she?

1779
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:20,460
The hermit.

1780
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:23,120
Oh, the crazy one!

1781
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:24,080
I remember.

1782
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:24,980
It's like here.

1783
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,020
Yeah.

1784
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:31,740
Alright, let's go for a crazy one I remember

1785
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:51,720
the first one I met okay after we get all the items we'll grab all the flea's too so we don't have to worry about the flea upgrade the nail upgrade later because we need a fully upgrade nail for this fuck like for this rack 3

1786
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:03,510

I feel like I haven't found enough crests.

1789
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:17,840
She's like here somewhere.

1790
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:19,760
Just the first one I met.

1791
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:23,360
There she is.

1792
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,360
Madam, I return seeking power to aid the construction of a trap.

1793
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:29,980
I request of your sibling residing on top of the citadel.

01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:31,500
Hanging under.

Oh my god, this dog is yapping.

1802
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:21,280
At least that stops after a while.

1803
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,020
This dog has not stopped.

1804
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:24,840
Have I unlocked everything?

1805
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,040
Yeah, I have.

1806
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:29,160
Okay, there's this one.

1808
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:36,720

1816
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:55,550
I'm not doing no healing.

1817
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:56,670
I'm sorry, guys.

1818
01:58:57,410 --> 01:58:59,190
I'm not strong enough.

1819
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:03,770
I know exactly what you're talking about.

1820
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:05,890
And you can't fool me.

1821
01:59:05,950 --> 01:59:06,410
I know.

1822
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:07,810
I know that ending.

1823
01:59:11,150 --> 01:59:13,510
It's not no damage, but it's no healing.

1824
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:15,110
And I think that's a little worse.

1825
01:59:17,070 --> 01:59:17,810
I've been up here.

1826
01:59:18,770 --> 01:59:19,590
Wait, what's up here?

1827
01:59:22,170 --> 01:59:22,830

Oh, there's the stair-setter.

01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:27,510
Oh, that's why I need it.

1831
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:28,510
Thank you for the raid.

1832
01:59:28,650 --> 01:59:29,830
I hope you had a great stream.

1833
01:59:30,030 --> 01:59:30,230
Thank you.

1834
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:30,810
Thank you.

1835
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:36,960
Yeah.

1836
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,320
Talk to Eva.

1837
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:41,020
Hello, Eva.

1838
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:47,860
Lady, if in your travels you're able to further expand your nature, return to me.

1839
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,340
What powers are possessed?

1840
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:51,160
I may be able to aid you further.

1841
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:52,640
Oh, okay.

1842
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:53,420
It doesn't matter.

1843
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:54,720
Okay.

1844
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:55,980
I don't have enough.

1845
01:59:58,060 --> 01:59:58,980
I need to...

1846
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,420
I need to unlock one more crest or some shit.

1847
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:05,020
Beam me up, Scotty.

1848
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:05,740
Wow.

1849
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,560
Yeah, I have three memory lockets, so I think...

1850
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,420
I'm pretty sure I can unlock it.

1851
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:17,280
Knock, knock.

1852
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,020
Walk and buy a crest from the architect?

1853
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:24,280
How much money do I have?

1854
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:25,620
Okay, where does she live?

1855
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:26,760
I forgot where she lived.

1856
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:28,160
It's been a while.

1857
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,880
Guys, do you guys remember where that lady lived?

1858
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:33,600
Because I don't.

1859
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:38,240
Underworks?

1860
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:40,160
Here.

1861
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:41,720
Where is it?

1862
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:42,760
Is it here?

1863
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:46,880
Where did she live?

1864
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:48,860
Here?

1865
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:51,620
Okay.

1866
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:54,540
Here, right?

1867
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:56,500
The little circles thing?

1868
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:58,740
Oh!

1869
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:00,820
Oh, I forgot that's the shop.

1870
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:03,540
Okay, I'll just put that there just just in case.

1871
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:08,560
Oh, yes, we can get the cog bug or whatever.

1872
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:10,540
That's helpful.

1873
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:16,080
Oh, I could have used that so long ago for boss fights.

1874
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:20,060
Thank God these guys are one hit.

1875
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:26,410
Also, like, where is the last last guy?

1876
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:27,570
Where's his soul?

1877
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:33,420
Where is his soul?

1878
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:34,880
Where's the hermit's soul?

1879
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:36,500
live.

1880
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:41,850
Belheart?

1881
02:01:46,050 --> 02:01:48,170
Yeah, we have a hermit at Belheart?

1882
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:49,090
Since when?

1883
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:51,890
I did not notice this.

1884
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:54,330
It's because he's... I just don't notice the poor.

1885
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:58,010
I've been Belheart, so I just don't notice him.

1886
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:01,850
I have not noticed this guy.

1887
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:10,780
Where's the homeless guy?

1888
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,140
Oh my god!

1889
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:14,020

Okay, there he is.

1895
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:52,280
Hello.

Slave?

1898
02:02:57,580 --> 02:02:59,120
I'm a traveler, stranger.

1899
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:00,340
Not a slave.

1900
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:03,280
No, I knew he was here, but I just wanted to explore more.

1901
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:04,240
I'm grunk.

1902
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:06,440
Exactly what a slave would say.

1903
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:07,300
Be gone!

1904
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:11,180
This is literally my first time I've spoken to him.

1905
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:13,360
So the slave comes seeking?

Actually, where am I?

1915
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:25,460
I'm so lost.

1916
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:26,800

1919
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:43,650

02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:48,650

Just try and figure out which way is faster.

1928
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:11,900
Just go here.

1929
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:13,280
Ow.

1930
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:15,760
Fuck it.

1931
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:22,390
Okay, we'll go from here, actually.

1932
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:25,410
Oh.

1933
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:27,030
That's fine.

1934
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:28,030
Dodged!

1935
02:06:32,350 --> 02:06:33,390
And then what?

1936
02:06:35,410 --> 02:06:36,270
Look at this way.

1937
02:06:37,030 --> 02:06:37,970
Get out of here.

1938
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:40,310
Get out of here, children!

1939
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:46,760
Get out of there.

1940
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:48,600
That's where I one-shot you now.

1941
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:54,900
While you're out here being mindless pilgrims, I was out there leveling up.

1942
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:05,260
Okay, we'll grab the sand thing first.

1943
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:06,240
Ada!

1944
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:10,620
Ada!

1945
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:12,160
I was studying the blade.

1946
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:15,580
I already forgot where to go.

1947
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:17,500
I already forgot.

1948
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:19,180
Yeah, okay, where is it?

1949
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:20,920
Blastic steps.

1950
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:22,420
Okay, blasted steps.

1951
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:23,460
Alright, here we go.

1952
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:35,030
The worst part is, like, all the fleas are, like, in places where...

1953
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:38,630
I don't have...

1954
02:07:38,630 --> 02:07:41,810
I'm pretty sure I'm missing some more fleas, too, I think.

1955
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:44,390
Because I think I didn't buy all the maps.

1956
02:07:44,690 --> 02:07:45,430
I'm pretty sure.

1957
02:07:47,450 --> 02:07:51,230
Okay, you should go to Greymore from Bellhop from optional Act 2 boss.

1958
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:51,970
It's fun.

1959
02:07:53,210 --> 02:07:56,570
definition of fun might not be my definition of fun.

1960
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:02,070
Darn you, thank you for the super chat.

1961
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:03,250
Thank you, thank you.

1962
02:08:03,930 --> 02:08:09,610
I have a feeling that we have two very different definitions of what fun is.

1963
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:14,030
Oh my god.

1964
02:08:15,650 --> 02:08:16,450
Give me a sec.

1965
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:17,370
I gotta swap.

1966
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:20,090
I just realized.

1967
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:22,390
I gotta go back down.

1968
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:34,030
I realized this is I remember you guys were like this is parkour and that's like didn't register in my head What I was like what is parkour?

1969
02:08:35,490 --> 02:08:37,510
What do you mean by parkour?

1970
02:08:39,610 --> 02:08:40,310
All right

1971
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:49,930
There you go Wait do I have my compass yeah

1972
02:08:54,290 --> 02:09:00,990
Okay, I have my parkour set up the grippers, my, my strong-ass grippers.

1973
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:06,350
Okay.

1974
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:08,710
Go up.

1975
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:15,280
Alright.

1976
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:16,820
He's gripping that wall.

1977
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:24,260
Whoops.

1978
02:09:25,380 --> 02:09:25,700
Get

1979
02:09:29,570 --> 02:09:30,530
him out of this way.

1980
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:30,970
No!

1981
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:32,910
My teeth scars!

1982
02:09:35,610 --> 02:09:36,330
Okay.

1983
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:42,760
Get him out of here.

1984
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:44,660
So how do I...

1985
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:46,640
Guys, how do I...

1986
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:47,780
get up there.

1987
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:49,220
Did I just keep going, right?

1988
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:53,180
I assume... Oh, it's here, right?

1989
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:56,140
Is it here?

1990
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:01,840
Okay.

1991
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:04,100
There we go.

1992
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:07,520
How do we get from across?

1993
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:13,570
Are you fucking kidding me?

1994
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:16,030
Oh my god, I'm so sad.

1995
02:10:17,850 --> 02:10:18,930
I'm so sad.

1996
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:21,750
Okay.

1997
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:24,270
I figured it out.

1998
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:31,960
I think it is.

1999
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:32,640
I think...

2000
02:10:39,630 --> 02:10:40,150
That's it.

2001
02:10:41,230 --> 02:10:41,770
No!

2002
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:42,150
No!

2003
02:10:42,730 --> 02:10:42,730
No!

2004
02:10:44,970 --> 02:10:46,570
Because I didn't know!

2005
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:51,910
I didn't know that's what it does!

2006
02:10:53,010 --> 02:10:53,670
Okay.

2007
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:55,390
Now I get it, though.

2008
02:10:59,190 --> 02:11:00,690
It's dumb, but I get it.

2009
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:08,360
Are you serious?

2010
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:09,900
Okay, that's fine.

02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:13,100

It was indeed both.

2083
02:18:06,690 --> 02:18:07,750
You're right.

2084
02:18:11,130 --> 02:18:12,810
It's secret bait.

2085
02:18:15,170 --> 02:18:16,650
I don't know why I doubted you.

2086
02:18:17,430 --> 02:18:19,950
You're indeed correct as to what that was.

2087
02:18:23,690 --> 02:18:26,130
Alright, now we go the hard thing.

2088
02:18:26,490 --> 02:18:27,890
The actual parkour shit.

02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:30,650
But how the fuck do I go up?

2090
02:18:33,230 --> 02:18:33,330
Oh.

2091
02:18:35,770 --> 02:18:37,390
That works too.

2092
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:43,820
Oh my god, that doesn't work.

2093
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:44,620
Oh, down.

2094
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:45,140
Okay.

2095
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:46,080
JK.

2096
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:49,360
Jesus Christ.

2097
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:54,560
Oh my god.

2098
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:01,120
Oh my, because of course.

02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:01,900
No, of course.

2100
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:02,220
No.

2101
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:04,420
No, no, that sounds right.

2102
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:06,420
That sounds right.

2103
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:08,160
Down is up.

2104
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:09,160
You're right.

2105
02:19:14,890 --> 02:19:15,410
Are you serious?

2106
02:19:15,550 --> 02:19:15,910
Are you?

2107
02:19:16,190 --> 02:19:16,570
How?

2108
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:18,890
How do I do this?

2109
02:19:20,130 --> 02:19:21,090
Fast enough.

2110
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:29,360
Too slow.

2111
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:57,180
Oh my gosh, I have to focus so hard.

2112
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:03,890
No.

2113
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:04,830
No.

2114
02:20:06,090 --> 02:20:06,870
Oh my god.

2115
02:20:07,010 --> 02:20:08,010
Oh my god, we did it.

2116
02:20:08,330 --> 02:20:09,250
Holy fuck.

2117
02:20:09,370 --> 02:20:13,030
Okay, I almost stumbled there because I didn't know what it looked like up top.

2118
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:14,950

Jesus no no no Oh my god No

2120
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:48,460
I still managed to fuck it up despite everything I hate this area.

2121
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:52,000
I hate this area so much.

2122
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:53,140
Holy shit.

2123
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:55,440
That's actual hell.

2124
02:20:57,700 --> 02:20:59,000
Oh my god.

2125
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:03,040
And like, I don't I don't know if there is a bench.

2126
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:06,960
I don't have to do this parkour all over.

2127
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:09,120
Let's see if I can...

2128
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:11,660

2129
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:14,100

Thank God.

2131
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:25,850
That's okay right now.

2132
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:29,890
Oh, fuck it.

Okay, it's a simple parkour.

2195
02:27:34,270 --> 02:27:35,150
Okay, that's fine.

2196

We're not timed.

2199
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:40,110
That's okay.

2200
02:27:40,630 --> 02:27:42,710

It's always bait.

2248
02:30:33,270 --> 02:30:34,210
It's never real.

2249
02:30:34,870 --> 02:30:35,450
Life ain't real.

2250
02:30:39,050 --> 02:30:39,870
This world.

2271
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:39,340
Yeah, now I can do simple geometry.

2272
02:31:39,980 --> 02:31:42,020
Okay, I assume this guy is for later.

2273
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:43,780
Wait, you just died?

2274
02:31:43,980 --> 02:31:45,900
Wait, the men just died there with him?

2275
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:47,540
What the fuck?

2276
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:55,440
All lost to fear.

2277
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:57,540
Remember our rule.

2278
02:31:58,460 --> 02:32:01,100
Now none to resist but us.

2279
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,600
Remember our strength.

2280
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:04,980
All to bow.

2281
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:06,100
Remember our strength.

2282
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:39,320
rule alone against the pill how do they die like why don't you just fucking get food how did you guys die just because he died you all decided to die they died oh they got silk even these guys where's the silk at oh i see the silk on him yeah they got aura farming i see silk on the king but I just got tired of parkour.

2283
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:40,280
Me too.

2284
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:40,980
Me too.

2285
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:44,080
I...

2286
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:46,900
Oh, was it him that was gonna get really hard?

2287
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:48,720
Was it the...

2288
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:51,360
Was it this guy that was gonna get really difficult?

2289
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:53,100
If I...

2290
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:54,600
Um...

2291
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:55,800
If I didn't kill him.

2292
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:57,280
Before Act 3.

2293
02:33:01,410 --> 02:33:03,590
Oh, that's why I see you.

2294
02:33:05,190 --> 02:33:05,710
Okay.

2295
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:07,570
I mean, he was like not that difficult.

2296
02:33:07,590 --> 02:33:09,650
and it was just pattern recognition.

2297
02:33:10,730 --> 02:33:12,030
Like, he was very predictable.

2298
02:33:14,090 --> 02:33:15,950
And I don't have, like, the stupid swamps.

2299
02:33:16,350 --> 02:33:17,790
Like, even though he...

2300
02:33:17,790 --> 02:33:22,770
Sorry, even though she brought, like, her kids to the fight, which is pretty fucked up, not gonna lie.

2301
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:25,450
Bring your children to settle your disputes.

2302
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:26,870
Like, that's fucked up.

2303
02:33:27,190 --> 02:33:29,950
Like, that's fucked up.

2304
02:33:31,910 --> 02:33:32,350
That's...

2305
02:33:32,350 --> 02:33:33,450
Wait, top, right?

2306
02:33:33,930 --> 02:33:34,350
What?

2307
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:35,710
What's the secret room?

2308
02:33:36,690 --> 02:33:37,570
Guys, but...

2309
02:33:37,590 --> 02:33:38,730
Is it required?

2310
02:33:39,610 --> 02:33:41,310
Lolly, thank you for the super chat.

2311
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:42,050
Thank you, thank you.

2312
02:33:42,190 --> 02:33:43,810
Okay, what do I get out of it?

2313
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:45,830
What do I...

2314
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:47,590
What do I get out of it?

2315
02:33:49,490 --> 02:33:50,010
I'm...

2316
02:33:50,010 --> 02:33:50,710
I...

2317
02:33:50,710 --> 02:33:51,130
I am...

2318
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:51,510
I...

2319
02:33:51,510 --> 02:33:53,150
Do I negotiate with terrorists?

2320
02:33:53,390 --> 02:33:54,030
That's the thing.

2321
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:56,290
What...

2322
02:33:56,290 --> 02:33:58,890
Just bring your kids a boss fight, Dave.

2323
02:34:02,850 --> 02:34:03,370
More...

2324
02:34:03,370 --> 02:34:03,950
Brady!

2325
02:34:04,850 --> 02:34:05,190
Okay.

2326
02:34:08,530 --> 02:34:12,090
A blue tour that increases silk damage.

2327
02:34:12,270 --> 02:34:13,470
Do I need that?

2328
02:34:13,550 --> 02:34:15,430
Guys, I don't have enough room.

2329
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:16,530
I...

2330
02:34:16,530 --> 02:34:18,130
Cool things to do cool.

2331
02:34:18,930 --> 02:34:20,850
Okay, I'll look at the boss.

2332
02:34:22,430 --> 02:34:23,450
I'll look at him.

2333
02:34:25,390 --> 02:34:27,470
It's always negotiable.

2334
02:34:27,950 --> 02:34:29,790
Do I negotiate with Terris?

2335
02:34:29,970 --> 02:34:30,830
That's like...

2336
02:34:30,830 --> 02:34:32,410
That's the one thing I need to know.

2337
02:34:32,510 --> 02:34:34,290
Do I let you negotiate?

2338
02:34:38,380 --> 02:34:38,980
Okay.

2339
02:34:44,730 --> 02:34:48,630
All right, we'll see how we'll see we'll see.

2340
02:34:49,290 --> 02:34:49,930
All right.

2341
02:34:50,570 --> 02:34:51,950
I assume it's here.

2342
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:54,590
Where is it?

2343
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:02,820
Where is it?

2344
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:06,940
Up?

2345
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:08,500
How do I get up?

2346
02:35:09,940 --> 02:35:10,920
Top, right?

2347
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:14,800
I can't do it.

2348
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:15,440
What?

2349
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:17,340
Dog line, then double jump.

2350
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:20,740
Oh, there we go.

2351
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:22,640
Jesus, what the fuck?

2352
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:26,420
What the fuck is this?

2353
02:35:28,180 --> 02:35:29,360
The vault nest.

2354
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:31,560
Oh my god, it's explosion, isn't it?

2355
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:33,340
Oh my, oh.

2356
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:37,960
I don't like this place.

2357
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:39,760
Why would you take me here?

2358
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:43,420
See, this is why you don't negotiate with terrorists.

2359
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:45,340
This is exactly why.

2360
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:48,700
It's okay.

2361
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:57,040
up why did i negotiate with you guys

2362
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:05,080
which way do i go right or left chat right or left

2363
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:11,720
could not mean it but fun okay

2364
02:36:17,060 --> 02:36:33,500
okay oh you waited until i went in the room to tell me that didn't you Of course, of course, of course, of course you wait until I come in here to tell me it's not needed.

2365
02:36:38,510 --> 02:36:39,550
Are you serious?

2366
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:48,980
Okay.

2367
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:51,640
Okay, it's literally just patterns.

2368
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:54,960
Alright.

2369
02:37:00,250 --> 02:37:01,210
Okay, that's fine.

2370
02:37:04,110 --> 02:37:05,430
Are you serious?

2371
02:37:05,930 --> 02:37:06,750
right there.

2372
02:37:07,710 --> 02:37:08,370
Okay, friend.

2373
02:37:11,510 --> 02:37:11,650
Alright.

2374
02:37:11,890 --> 02:37:12,570
Oh my god.

2375
02:37:13,970 --> 02:37:15,490
Because I have to keep looking up.

2376
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:17,790
So sometimes I don't see it.

2377
02:37:20,890 --> 02:37:21,270
Alright.

2378
02:37:21,790 --> 02:37:22,270
Jesus.

2379
02:37:22,730 --> 02:37:24,590
You can get cornered from here so easily.

2380
02:37:26,010 --> 02:37:27,070
There we go.

2381
02:37:27,330 --> 02:37:27,810
That's...

2382
02:37:27,810 --> 02:37:29,530
Okay, don't tell me you have a part two.

2383
02:37:30,030 --> 02:37:30,850
Don't tell me.

2384
02:37:30,950 --> 02:37:31,690
There we go.

2385
02:37:32,030 --> 02:37:34,370
I was gonna say, you do not deserve a part two.

2386
02:37:34,690 --> 02:37:35,190
You just...

2387
02:37:36,110 --> 02:37:39,690
You absolutely does not deserve a Sage 2 fight.

2388
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:41,310
There we go.

2389
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:46,400
Yeah, that was easy.

2390
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:47,300
Thank God.

2391
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:50,140
He does this.

2392
02:37:53,020 --> 02:37:54,360
No, he doesn't.

2393
02:37:55,300 --> 02:37:56,860
He does not deserve anything.

2394
02:37:58,040 --> 02:37:58,720
Wait, what's it?

2395
02:37:58,840 --> 02:37:59,420
Right side?

2396
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:00,440
Oh, there it is.

2397
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:01,200
Oh, inspect.

2398
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:02,580
I ordered an outcrop.

2399
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:03,060
What?

2400
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:03,880
That's it?

2401
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:05,200
That's it?

2402
02:38:05,220 --> 02:38:06,040
Is this just lore?

2403
02:38:10,130 --> 02:38:12,730
Oh yeah, I have a lot of super crits for some reason.

2404
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:23,280
Oh, I can leave now.

2405
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:24,900
Oh yeah, it's my nerd's book.

2406
02:38:25,380 --> 02:38:26,160
Of course it does.

2407
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:28,160
Everything is nerd related.

2408
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:28,900
Wait, what's over here?

2409
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:29,900
Oh wait, that's nothing.

2410
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:30,380
Whoops.

2411
02:38:36,130 --> 02:38:36,530
Okay.

2412
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:42,640
How do we go up?

2413
02:38:46,420 --> 02:38:47,460
Oh, there we go.

2414
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:48,360
Now I'm a shortcut.

2415
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:49,020
There you go.

2416
02:38:52,740 --> 02:38:53,140
Oh.

2417
02:38:53,160 --> 02:39:11,200
I what oh my god okay I don't know how okay that was scary oh my god that was so scary oh my god anything that could go wrong literally just went wrong today no

2418
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:24,600

2419
02:39:24,940 --> 02:39:27,720
I forgot where I am.

2420
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:33,800
Down is so hard.

2421
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:38,120
Guys, down is scary.

2422
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:40,800
I keep walking.

2423
02:39:40,900 --> 02:39:42,580
I can't hope it I'm a bug.

2424
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:44,260
It was glowing.

2425
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:48,440
It called for me.

2426
02:39:49,780 --> 02:39:51,240
I can't help it.

2427
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:53,140
The sapper calls for me.

2428
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:53,500
me.

2429
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:57,060
I saw all my brethren died the same way.

2430
02:39:57,500 --> 02:39:58,980
But I was like, I'm different.

2431
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:04,680
I told myself I'm the one that will tank it up.

2432
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:11,160
Okay, where is my thing?

2433
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:12,520
Oh, where is it?

2434
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:13,180
Here it is.

2435
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:14,780
Oh my god, it's literally right there.

2436
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:16,760
That's the part that sucked.

2437
02:40:19,160 --> 02:40:20,280
I'm pretty late.

2438
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:21,860
Okay.

2439
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:27,120
Okay.

2440
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:28,620
We can go straight down now.

2441
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:30,760
Alright, now we get the rest of the fleas.

2442
02:40:32,660 --> 02:40:33,280
God damn it.

2443
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:37,760
God, fucking...

2444
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:38,860
Okay, let me get out of here.

2445
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:40,880
Oh my god, I just hit everything.

2446
02:40:41,020 --> 02:40:41,580
That's fine.

2447
02:40:41,820 --> 02:40:42,660
That's fine.

2448
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:43,640
I'll make it.

2449
02:40:44,480 --> 02:40:45,880
I'll make it.

2450
02:40:49,960 --> 02:40:52,580
This has been the filler of all filler episodes.

2451
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:54,480
Okay.

2452
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:55,840
Chair.

2453
02:40:56,380 --> 02:40:59,160
Alright, now we get the other fleas.

2454
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:01,120
Okay, where am I missing them?

2455
02:41:01,380 --> 02:41:09,600
I feel like I'm missing a lot because I know like, um, I didn't do, I didn't buy all the maps.

2456
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:13,160
Okay, here.

2457
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:14,860
How do I get here?

2458
02:41:16,140 --> 02:41:21,400
I'll do the exhaust organ and then, oh my god, that's bio water.

2459
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,920
Maybe I don't do exhaust organ.

2460
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:27,560
Maybe.

2461
02:41:28,940 --> 02:41:29,220
Maybe.

2462
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:30,040
No, I can.

2463
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:35,940
I'll do exhaust organ way, and then I go here back to sin, I guess.

2464
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:40,640
And then there's one more that I was missing somewhere else.

2465
02:41:41,700 --> 02:41:42,860
I saw it, too.

2466
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:45,560
Am I missing another flea?

2467
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:47,580
Yeah, here we go.

2468
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:48,940
How do we get this one?

2469
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,860
Where's the secret passage for this?

2470
02:41:58,780 --> 02:42:01,100
Where was the secret passage for this one?

2471
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:02,380
Below it?

2472
02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:03,160
Right here?

2473
02:42:05,540 --> 02:42:06,420
Is it this?

2474
02:42:08,520 --> 02:42:09,720
I'll do Mount Faye first.

2475
02:42:17,890 --> 02:42:19,270
Okay, what's the climb up?

2476
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:24,050
Okay, this way.

2477
02:42:24,190 --> 02:42:25,730
Okay, I just need to know the climb up.

2478
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:28,670
Alright, let's go.

2479
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:29,930
At least I can't freeze.

2480
02:42:30,130 --> 02:42:31,290
Because I have, I don't know.

2481
02:42:31,350 --> 02:42:32,470
Do I have pants on now?

2482
02:42:33,730 --> 02:42:34,210
Ada!

2483
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:40,300
Wait, where is it?

2484
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:44,300
Closest is... the slab.

2485
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:46,540
The slab is the gnosis.

2486
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:52,760
Yeah, apparently I put on some pants.

2487
02:42:57,370 --> 02:42:58,250
Oh, it's this way.

2488
02:43:00,330 --> 02:43:01,630
Too hot to freeze.

2489
02:43:02,190 --> 02:43:02,670
Exactly.

2490
02:43:03,570 --> 02:43:04,690
Jesus Christ, okay.

2491
02:43:07,370 --> 02:43:09,810
Is there an easier way?

2492
02:43:14,090 --> 02:43:14,890
Just fucked.

2493
02:43:17,150 --> 02:43:17,510
Okay.

2494
02:43:26,170 --> 02:43:26,690
Alright.

2495
02:43:27,130 --> 02:43:28,210
Uh, this way.

2496
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:29,270
Wait, actually?

2497
02:43:30,930 --> 02:43:32,210
Grab, we'll go this way.

2498
02:43:32,850 --> 02:43:33,850
Yeah, this way is easier.

2499
02:43:35,010 --> 02:43:36,610
Parkour it is, I guess.

2500
02:43:39,370 --> 02:43:41,310
It's fine, I can't freeze anyway.

2501
02:43:42,930 --> 02:43:43,250
Whoops.

2502
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:46,970
I can still mess up, apparently.

2503
02:43:50,270 --> 02:43:51,130
Wait, what?

2504
02:43:52,130 --> 02:43:53,790
How do I get up here?

2505
02:43:55,310 --> 02:43:56,530
Oh, wrong way?

2506
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,780
Oh, from the outside.

2507
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:03,440
Oh, here?

2508
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:04,420
Oh, yeah!

2509
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:08,640
Guys, it's been so long since I did this parkour, like, I legitimately don't remember.

2510
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:13,080
Okay, yeah, I can do this way.

2511
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:19,120
Okay.

2512
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:23,280
There you go.

2513
02:44:23,860 --> 02:44:52,190
easier because I literally have all the good shit right now okay it's still a lot easier I just I got a little overconfident there there we go okay there we go

2514
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:58,320
God, this is stupid parkour.

2515
02:44:58,620 --> 02:44:59,340
Alright, nice.

2516
02:45:00,420 --> 02:45:02,800
And then it should be up top...

2517
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:04,700
Yeah.

2518
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:10,820
I forgot he existed.

2519
02:45:11,800 --> 02:45:12,320
I forgot.

2520
02:45:13,980 --> 02:45:15,700
A little booby trap right there.

2521
02:45:18,440 --> 02:45:18,820
Alright.

2522
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:20,680
Me and myself.

2523
02:45:26,300 --> 02:45:27,960
Thank God we needed that, actually.

2524
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:33,160
Okay.

2525
02:45:33,320 --> 02:45:35,380
So it's somewhere here.

2526
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:39,860
Not the team who cameras.

2527
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:40,480
I know, right?

2528
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:43,680
Oh, I knew it.

2529
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:44,660
It's a fucking secret.

2530
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:46,340
Oh, my God.

2531
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:47,620
We gotta break some ice, too.

2532
02:45:49,020 --> 02:45:50,100
Oh, my God.

2533
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:51,260
Oh, I can die.

2534
02:45:51,740 --> 02:45:52,840
Oh, there he is.

2535
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:56,660
Goodbye, child.

2536
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:58,040
I freed you.

2537
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:00,060
Don't worry.

2538
02:46:00,140 --> 02:46:01,220
I'm here to save you.

2539
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:02,880
Alright, now we can go.

It's not rude.

2542
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:36,840
Some kids were just stupid.

2543
02:46:37,060 --> 02:46:39,820
Like, we're just stupid, and you can't fix it.

2544
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:41,080
You just gotta accept it.

2545
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:42,960
It's just life at that point.

2546
02:46:43,180 --> 02:46:44,560
Not every child is special.

2547
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:46,440
Some of them are extra special.

2548
02:46:51,980 --> 02:46:52,340
Alright.

2549
02:46:53,140 --> 02:46:53,660
Raymore.

2550
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:56,080
It's accurate.

2551
02:47:02,860 --> 02:47:05,480
Okay, we gotta go to Sinner's Road.

2552
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:06,640
Yet again.

2553
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:12,380

Now she gets it.

2556
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:05,440
I feel like I've been went through this so long.

2557
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:08,740
Hit up.

2558
02:48:09,060 --> 02:48:09,440
Right.

2559
02:48:10,260 --> 02:48:11,430

02:48:16,090 --> 02:48:18,150
I also gotta grab the...

2561
02:48:18,150 --> 02:48:20,250
Grab the bench too, just in case.

2562
02:48:20,730 --> 02:48:21,730

2569
02:49:35,300 --> 02:49:35,880
That's crazy.

2570
02:49:37,220 --> 02:49:38,240
Why is it over there?

2571
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:39,940
I've never been over here.

2572
02:49:40,860 --> 02:49:41,780
Is it even worth it?

2573
02:49:45,860 --> 02:49:46,820
They're all sleeping.

2574
02:49:54,220 --> 02:49:55,120
Is this lore?

2575
02:49:57,880 --> 02:49:59,560
Oh, it's all silk eating!

2576
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:00,320
Oh!

2577
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:03,500
Wait, is this skill?

2578
02:50:03,720 --> 02:50:05,300
Wait, wait, no, this is not lore.

2579
02:50:05,780 --> 02:50:06,840
Oh, wait, it is!

2580
02:50:07,160 --> 02:50:08,020
It's a chair!

2581
02:50:08,600 --> 02:50:10,160
What happened?

2582
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:11,140
Hello?

2583
02:50:12,940 --> 02:50:14,480
I saw you.

2584
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:16,400
I saw what you did.

2585
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:18,220
Strong you are, mistress.

2586
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:19,720
Small.

2587
02:50:20,260 --> 02:50:22,740
But so deadly and your sin will age.

2588
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:25,320
See, I come to claim you and I am...

2589
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:28,860
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2590
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:30,800
I'm not come to claim you.

2591
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:32,360
You are your own free man.

2592
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:33,440
I'm yours.

2593
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:35,140
I am your humble slave.

2594
02:50:36,120 --> 02:50:38,580
I have no interest in mastery over you.

2595
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:42,420
Sir, if my slain of these creatures aided you, it was merely by chance.

2596
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:44,060
Farewell.

2597
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:45,800
Farewell?

2598
02:50:46,040 --> 02:50:46,600
No!

2599
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:48,880
The strong claim, the weak.

2600
02:50:48,980 --> 02:50:51,040
Oh my god, he's fucking freaky.

2601
02:50:51,500 --> 02:50:53,880
And the weak must serve.

2602
02:50:54,180 --> 02:50:57,760
I am yours, my mistress, and you must step.

2603
02:50:57,840 --> 02:50:59,560
Oh, I have to protect you too.

2604
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:04,180
I feel prepared for the coming, my mistress, my powerful mistress.

2605
02:51:04,760 --> 02:51:07,460
While you're away hunting, I'll grow you something good.

2606
02:51:08,600 --> 02:51:39,920

2607
02:51:42,540 --> 02:51:46,240
It was everything that could have happened happened to me in that room.

2608
02:51:48,400 --> 02:51:48,920
That's fine.

2609
02:51:49,240 --> 02:51:49,560
We'll just

2610
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:53,860
go down.

2611
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:57,940
Are you serious?

2612
02:51:58,180 --> 02:51:58,640
It rolled.

2613
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:00,500
Okay, that's fine.

2614
02:52:03,340 --> 02:52:04,580
Oh my god.

2615
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:05,740
Oh my god.

2616
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:06,620
Oh my god.

2617
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:11,220
It did everything I didn't want him to do.

2618
02:52:11,500 --> 02:52:13,080
That's fucking I hate this.

2619
02:52:17,440 --> 02:52:18,100
Truly the worst.

2620
02:52:20,900 --> 02:52:22,940
One last tip for the road.

2621
02:52:23,900 --> 02:52:26,380
Then I'll never come back here until I have.

2622
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:27,980
Until I come back.

2623
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:28,900
Or act 3.

2624
02:52:29,220 --> 02:52:31,740
Until it gets so much worse than act 3.

2625
02:52:32,360 --> 02:52:33,460
Alright, just in case.

2626
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:34,780
Because I don't want to.

2627
02:52:34,780 --> 02:52:36,220
If I die I don't want to go back.

2628
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:38,180
I don't want to do the fucking ultimate run back.

2629
02:52:54,100 --> 02:52:56,380
Oh my god, I keep forgetting the dogs.

2630

02:54:13,790 --> 02:54:15,350

Yeah.

2656
02:54:38,410 --> 02:54:40,230
How many craft metals do I have, actually?

2657
02:54:40,910 --> 02:54:41,950
That's a good question.

2658
02:54:44,670 --> 02:54:45,090

Biner's keeper.

02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:55,300
How was I supposed to know you had stuff?

2676
02:55:56,200 --> 02:55:57,420
Oh, there's a key area.

2677
02:55:58,080 --> 02:55:58,380
Okay.

2678
02:55:59,280 --> 02:55:59,620
Sure.

2679
02:56:00,620 --> 02:56:02,540
Where's the cogs tool, though?

2680
02:56:03,140 --> 02:56:04,240
That the cogs eyes.

2681
02:56:11,480 --> 02:56:11,880
Hello?

2682
02:56:12,840 --> 02:56:13,600

2683
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:15,680
Wait, what is this?

2684
02:56:24,450 --> 02:56:26,430

2686
02:56:29,030 --> 02:56:29,790
What is this?

2687
02:56:30,010 --> 02:56:30,770
Oh, is it the string?

2688
02:56:30,950 --> 02:56:31,850
Oh, it's the string thing.

2689
02:56:32,010 --> 02:56:32,990
Okay, fuck that shit.

2690
02:56:33,190 --> 02:56:34,290
I don't have enough money for that.

2691
02:56:35,490 --> 02:56:37,390
I don't have the privilege for that.

2692
02:56:39,090 --> 02:56:40,510
Oh my god, I forgot what these guys.

2693
02:56:44,870 --> 02:56:46,070
God, I can't trust anybody.

2694
02:56:46,090 --> 02:56:46,810
places here.

2695
02:56:47,390 --> 02:56:47,910
I knew it.

2696
02:56:49,170 --> 02:56:50,610
Oh my god, that was bait.

2697
02:56:51,270 --> 02:56:52,870
Then I looked, this is what you could get.

2698
02:56:53,490 --> 02:56:54,030
Hee-hee.

2699
02:56:55,510 --> 02:56:57,850
Look at all the money you can't have.

2700
02:56:58,190 --> 02:56:58,250
Whoa.

2701
02:56:59,050 --> 02:56:59,850
Is that cool?

2702
02:57:00,950 --> 02:57:02,930
You could have had all this money.

2703
02:57:03,510 --> 02:57:04,790
Just lying there.

2704
02:57:05,550 --> 02:57:06,590
Oh my god.

2705
02:57:09,110 --> 02:57:10,070
What the fuck do I?

2706
02:57:14,850 --> 02:57:17,710

2707
02:57:18,530 --> 02:57:19,270

02:57:20,670 --> 02:57:21,490
There we go.

2709
02:57:22,030 --> 02:57:22,870
There we go.

2710
02:57:23,290 --> 02:57:23,290
Jesus.

2711
02:57:23,710 --> 02:57:24,390
There we go.

2712
02:57:33,110 --> 02:57:33,290
Noink.

2713
02:57:33,530 --> 02:57:34,710

2714
02:57:35,870 --> 02:57:36,610
I deserve this.

2715
02:57:36,650 --> 02:57:38,050
Finders, keepers.

2716
02:57:40,430 --> 02:57:41,710
You know what they said.

2717
02:57:42,230 --> 02:57:43,370
Finders, keepers.

2718
02:57:44,690 --> 02:57:44,810

So much money.

2724
02:57:54,810 --> 02:57:55,710
Soon as this is a secret.

2725
02:57:55,990 --> 02:57:56,770
This is a shortcut.

2726
02:57:57,410 --> 02:57:58,690
Oh my god, I almost unlocked that.

2727
02:58:01,830 --> 02:58:02,970
Oh, it is shortcut.

Oh my god.

2730
02:58:10,770 --> 02:58:12,670
It's worth it.

2731
02:58:14,890 --> 02:58:16,610
Guys, it was worth it.

2732
02:58:16,710 --> 02:58:18,190
You guys, you don't understand.

2733
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:24,500

2736
02:59:03,670 --> 02:59:05,270
Just farm it for it.

2737
02:59:06,910 --> 02:59:08,010
It's up here.

2738
02:59:11,360 --> 02:59:12,840
No, that's a baby.

2739
02:59:15,740 --> 02:59:18,140
Uh, oh my god, it's so far.

2740
02:59:18,260 --> 02:59:19,280
Wait, can I even?

2741
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:21,560
I should be able to, right?

2742
02:59:22,460 --> 02:59:23,860
I think so.

2743
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:25,860
I think I can choose this.

2744
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:28,080
No!

2745
02:59:28,520 --> 02:59:29,620
Wait, I could cheese it.

2746
02:59:29,860 --> 02:59:30,540
I could cheese it.

2747
02:59:38,130 --> 02:59:40,190
Oh, I was doing so well.

2748
02:59:41,830 --> 02:59:44,510
He can, but not necessarily sane.

2749
02:59:44,670 --> 02:59:45,570
Okay, it's not fun.

2750
02:59:45,670 --> 02:59:46,690
Okay, I believe you guys.

2751
02:59:46,810 --> 02:59:47,990
I don't think I was having fun.

2752
02:59:48,430 --> 02:59:52,370
I think you're right.

2753
02:59:52,490 --> 02:59:53,630
It did not seem that fun.

2754
02:59:53,770 --> 02:59:54,570
But I was doing it.

2755
02:59:54,570 --> 02:59:55,710
Okay, I have to go from here.

2756
02:59:56,330 --> 02:59:57,690
Okay, from here.

2757
02:59:58,150 --> 02:59:58,530
Okay.

2758
03:00:03,570 --> 03:00:05,110
There's a breakable wall?

2759
03:00:05,650 --> 03:00:05,890
Where?

2760
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:12,440
Where was the breakable wall?

2761
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:16,820
Wait, what?

2762
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:18,340
On the pipe?

2763
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:19,580
Like, back there?

2764
03:00:25,960 --> 03:00:26,480
There?

2765
03:00:27,760 --> 03:00:29,100
Oh, I see it.

2766
03:00:36,760 --> 03:00:37,880
Okay, there we go.

2767
03:00:38,240 --> 03:00:39,080
I saw it.

2768
03:00:39,800 --> 03:00:40,780
Hey, what's over here?

2769
03:00:42,340 --> 03:00:43,800
Oh my god, there's more stuff.

2770
03:00:45,140 --> 03:00:45,980
How do I get up there?

2771
03:00:46,120 --> 03:00:46,380
though.

2772
03:00:50,500 --> 03:00:51,400
How the fuck?

2773
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,540
Oh my god, I hear those goddamn bats.

2774
03:00:55,960 --> 03:00:56,720
The bug bats.

2775
03:00:57,720 --> 03:00:58,360
It's fine.

2776
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:07,720
Oh my god, it's not fine anymore.

2777
03:01:09,300 --> 03:01:11,100
I lied when I say it's fine.

2778
03:01:12,920 --> 03:01:14,960
Guys, it was apparently not fine.

2779
03:01:17,380 --> 03:01:18,520
Okay, there we go.

2780
03:01:20,240 --> 03:01:21,300
So I'm still in there.

2781
03:01:21,460 --> 03:01:22,120
There's more.

2782
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:23,540
Oh my god, it's the goddamn more.

2783
03:01:23,560 --> 03:01:26,480
I just

2784
03:01:31,110 --> 03:01:32,410
want to know if there's anything.

2785
03:01:33,910 --> 03:01:34,570
It's just water.

2786
03:01:34,730 --> 03:01:35,970
I'm just hitting water.

2787
03:01:37,390 --> 03:01:38,750
What the fuck?

2788
03:01:39,330 --> 03:01:39,990
Where am I?

2789
03:01:40,170 --> 03:01:41,610
Now where am I?

2790
03:01:46,210 --> 03:01:46,810
Oh!

2791
03:01:47,170 --> 03:01:47,430
Wait!

2792
03:01:47,810 --> 03:01:48,150
Nice!

2793
03:01:48,230 --> 03:01:49,130
This is the easy way.

2794
03:01:53,880 --> 03:01:55,300
Down left for a shortcut?

2795
03:01:56,160 --> 03:01:57,340
No, I'm right here now.

2796
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:00,680
Yeah.

2797
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:02,560
This works too.

2798
03:02:06,700 --> 03:02:07,520
That's easy.

2799
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:08,500
I needed that.

2800
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:12,780
Here I go.

2801
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:14,580
I'm on a little ferris wheel.

2802
03:02:15,260 --> 03:02:15,520
Yeah.

2803
03:02:18,320 --> 03:02:20,020
Okay, where do I need to go now?

2804
03:02:20,960 --> 03:02:21,240
Oh, wait.

2805
03:02:21,280 --> 03:02:22,120
There's a...

2806
03:02:22,120 --> 03:02:23,320
Wait, there's something downstairs.

2807
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:24,720
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2808
03:02:25,760 --> 03:02:27,040
I didn't even notice that.

2809
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:32,480
Is there shards?

2810
03:02:32,980 --> 03:02:33,640
That's it?

2811
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:37,100
Oh, that was it.

2812
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:42,280

2816
03:03:23,980 --> 03:03:25,420
Oh my god.

2817
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:26,520
Oh my god.

2818
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:27,340
Okay, it's fine.

2819
03:03:29,960 --> 03:03:31,040
It's not fine.

2820
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:31,340
No!

2821
03:03:33,400 --> 03:03:34,320
Okay, I'm fine.

2822
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:34,920
I'm fine.

2823
03:03:35,260 --> 03:03:36,400
It's so fine.

2824
03:03:37,100 --> 03:03:38,660
Oh, it wasn't even a master.

2825
03:03:38,840 --> 03:03:39,580
It was a school.

2826
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:40,480
That's fine.

2827
03:03:41,960 --> 03:03:42,980
Oh my god.

2828
03:03:42,980 --> 03:03:44,280
I just used them as platforms.

2829
03:03:44,980 --> 03:03:46,100
Oh my god.

2830
03:03:47,160 --> 03:03:50,200
Okay, maybe I can...

2831
03:03:50,200 --> 03:03:50,560
Nice.

2832
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:52,520
Okay, I need them for HP too.

2833
03:03:55,420 --> 03:03:55,820
Yay!

2834
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:01,080
Okay.

2835
03:04:05,810 --> 03:04:07,710
Oh god, these guys.

2836
03:04:09,010 --> 03:04:10,550
Oh my god, I forgot that.

2837
03:04:10,970 --> 03:04:12,910
Oh my god, I forgot about this too.

2838
03:04:12,950 --> 03:04:13,410
I'm drowned.

2839
03:04:14,090 --> 03:04:16,170
I can't swim against the current!

2840
03:04:17,450 --> 03:04:20,030
I forgot a lot of things about these guys.

2841
03:04:25,970 --> 03:04:27,390
Jesus, fuck off!

2842
03:04:30,670 --> 03:04:32,270
Actually, fuck off!

2843
03:04:32,390 --> 03:04:36,850
I'm fine.

2844
03:04:38,450 --> 03:04:40,590
Oh my god, it's the left room there.

2845
03:04:40,670 --> 03:04:41,430
I see the room.

2846
03:04:44,290 --> 03:04:45,610
Okay, they go up.

2847
03:04:45,690 --> 03:04:47,130
Oh shit, I have to go down.

2848
03:05:02,470 --> 03:05:12,690

2850
03:05:26,850 --> 03:05:27,810
Whose body is this?

2851
03:05:28,950 --> 03:05:29,550
Oh, secret.

2852
03:05:31,210 --> 03:05:32,330
Oh my god.

2853
03:05:42,870 --> 03:05:44,970
We're not coming back here.

2854
03:05:46,950 --> 03:05:48,870
I'm not coming back.

2855
03:05:49,330 --> 03:05:49,530
Goodbye.

2856
03:05:50,910 --> 03:05:53,490
I have a guy that makes me silk eaters.

2857
03:05:53,630 --> 03:05:54,950
I don't need them anymore.

2858
03:05:55,510 --> 03:05:57,290
I don't need it anymore.

2859
03:05:58,790 --> 03:05:59,310
There you go.

2860
03:05:59,910 --> 03:06:01,510
I literally have a guy.

2861
03:06:01,630 --> 03:06:02,990
I have a guy, guys.

2862
03:06:03,630 --> 03:06:05,230
That can make me silk eaters.

2863
03:06:10,870 --> 03:06:15,010
Oh yeah, I should grab the cogs of my children.

2864
03:06:18,400 --> 03:06:20,180
There you go.

2865
03:06:21,460 --> 03:06:22,020
Hello.

2866
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:23,080
Hello kids.

2867
03:06:23,260 --> 03:06:23,740
Is there three?

2868
03:06:23,900 --> 03:06:24,260
Max?

2869
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:25,200
I don't remember.

2870
03:06:27,280 --> 03:06:28,560
Me and my dragoons.

2871
03:06:30,020 --> 03:06:30,940
Rolling it up.

2872
03:06:34,740 --> 03:06:35,300
Uh.

2873
03:06:35,580 --> 03:06:36,560
Uh, four?

2874
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:37,240
Alright.

2875
03:06:37,980 --> 03:06:38,260
Oops.

2876
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:40,500
Wait, where are it?

2877
03:06:43,590 --> 03:06:47,830
And since this is the underworks area, it's all the way down.

2878
03:06:49,790 --> 03:06:50,810
It's okay.

2879
03:06:52,170 --> 03:06:55,070
Me and my dragoons rolling up, committing crime.

2880
03:06:57,630 --> 03:06:59,190
Where did they go?

2881
03:07:01,670 --> 03:07:02,730
Oh, I freaked.

2882
03:07:02,790 --> 03:07:05,050
They don't even know how to... Okay.

2883
03:07:06,210 --> 03:07:09,490
I didn't realize don't know how to use elevators.

2884
03:07:09,870 --> 03:07:12,510
How was I supposed to know that?

2885
03:07:14,250 --> 03:07:18,230
How was I supposed to know you don't know how to use an elevator?

2886
03:07:18,730 --> 03:07:20,850
I didn't know you were fucking stupid.

2887
03:07:24,450 --> 03:07:26,530
How do I get across?

2888
03:07:26,750 --> 03:07:27,530
Wait, what?

2889
03:07:29,330 --> 03:07:31,010
How do I get over there?

2890
03:07:36,290 --> 03:07:36,870
Wait.

2891
03:07:37,770 --> 03:07:39,490
How do we get over there?

2892
03:07:39,670 --> 03:07:41,530
And she abandoned us.

2893
03:07:44,810 --> 03:07:46,590
Probably get over there.

2894
03:07:49,650 --> 03:07:51,250
The right side here?

2895
03:07:56,570 --> 03:07:57,950
Oh my god, it's...

2896
03:07:57,950 --> 03:07:58,350
Oh hey.

2897
03:08:00,330 --> 03:08:01,210
Is that important?

2898
03:08:03,230 --> 03:08:04,170
Oh, fuck it.

2899
03:08:04,270 --> 03:08:06,930
Clearly not that important, because I don't care enough.

2900
03:08:09,270 --> 03:08:10,810
It's not that important.

2901
03:08:10,910 --> 03:08:12,010
to me.

2902
03:08:15,610 --> 03:08:17,690
God, that cost me $40, too.

2903
03:08:20,870 --> 03:08:21,450
Oh, wait.

2904
03:08:21,650 --> 03:08:23,090
Oh, I was like, where did she go?

2905
03:08:25,210 --> 03:08:26,630
You're scattered about the city.

2906
03:08:26,870 --> 03:08:28,370
Each seemingly laid with purpose.

2907
03:08:28,610 --> 03:08:32,490
Someone wished the thing dismantled, but showed respect enough to see it stir safe.

2908
03:08:33,730 --> 03:08:35,830
That height is in aspired form.

2909
03:08:36,050 --> 03:08:39,370
Seized by the first of my line for a night of cog and blade.

2910
03:08:40,270 --> 03:09:11,630
In it, I my predecessors talent immense now lost forget forgotten i could never create a copy of work so so fine a night that once bore the heart tell me of them a glimmering order hogwarts sentinels so impressive majestic in function they were charged but but bound to the highest holy duty now before the creation of the core the sentinels ventured even beyond these walls to see all bugs brought forth safe to serve the citadel it's the Alright,

2911
03:09:11,690 --> 03:09:12,350
we're restored.

2912
03:09:12,710 --> 03:09:14,110
We're in the sentinel shell.

2913
03:09:14,570 --> 03:09:15,670
Would it give thanks for the awakening?

2914
03:09:15,970 --> 03:09:18,070
Or would it grieve those lands now in the lost?

2915
03:09:18,570 --> 03:09:21,230
In time, Maker, I may find out.

2916
03:09:21,850 --> 03:09:22,910
Alright, let's see.

2917
03:09:22,970 --> 03:09:23,930
What did we need in?

2918
03:09:25,210 --> 03:09:26,030
Architect's key?

2919
03:09:27,690 --> 03:09:28,470
Is that it?

2920
03:09:34,370 --> 03:09:34,930
Alright.

2921
03:09:37,010 --> 03:09:38,450
Here you go, take it.

2922
03:09:43,220 --> 03:09:44,520
Alright, that's it.

2923
03:09:46,480 --> 03:09:47,040
Alright.

2924
03:09:49,620 --> 03:09:50,580
over here.

2925
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:53,540
Bro, this was...

2926
03:09:54,120 --> 03:09:55,380
How does this go?

2927
03:09:56,120 --> 03:09:57,000
Did I do this yet?

2928
03:09:57,780 --> 03:09:58,420
Oh, I did.

2929
03:09:59,800 --> 03:10:00,660
Oh, hey.

2930
03:10:01,140 --> 03:10:01,700
No, I didn't.

2931
03:10:03,500 --> 03:10:04,280
What's in here?

2932
03:10:04,700 --> 03:10:06,140
Oh, it's the crest, right?

2933
03:10:11,240 --> 03:10:12,180
Chapel of the Art.

2934
03:10:12,260 --> 03:10:13,400
Oh, hey, that guy.

2935
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:14,700
I've killed one before.

2936
03:10:17,180 --> 03:10:17,840
That's right.

2937
03:10:18,120 --> 03:10:18,600
Absorb.

2938
03:10:18,920 --> 03:10:19,440
Get inside.

2939
03:10:19,460 --> 03:10:20,180
Add me.

2940
03:10:25,260 --> 03:10:25,520
Oh!

2941
03:10:32,210 --> 03:10:32,950
Yay!

2942
03:10:33,790 --> 03:10:35,390
Spin the needle as a screw.

2943
03:10:35,610 --> 03:10:36,310
Shredding froze.

2944
03:10:36,510 --> 03:10:39,450
Spend skill to rapidly craft new tools.

2945
03:10:42,290 --> 03:10:43,430
What's it do?

2946
03:10:45,710 --> 03:10:46,990
Up and D?

2947
03:10:47,830 --> 03:10:49,170
What does that do?

2948
03:10:51,370 --> 03:10:52,070
Oh.

2949
03:10:52,410 --> 03:10:53,270
Guess he's dead.

2950
03:10:56,470 --> 03:10:58,730
Oh, I can craft tools.

2951
03:11:04,130 --> 03:11:04,930
Well, it has nothing.

2952
03:11:05,130 --> 03:11:05,330
Okay.

2953
03:11:05,950 --> 03:11:06,450
That's cool.

2954
03:11:07,030 --> 03:11:07,370
Oh, wait.

2955
03:11:07,370 --> 03:11:08,270
I can unlock it now.

2956
03:11:09,250 --> 03:11:10,110
Yellow, blue.

2957
03:11:11,330 --> 03:11:14,690
We'll grab one yellow, one blue.

2958
03:11:15,950 --> 03:11:18,530
And then do we need another yellow or blue?

2959
03:11:21,290 --> 03:11:24,270
I feel like we can grab another blue.

2960
03:11:28,170 --> 03:11:28,690
All right.

2961
03:11:30,390 --> 03:11:31,190
Two things.

2962
03:11:31,430 --> 03:11:34,270
Use Architects Crest to use Light Ballad Neal nine times.

2963
03:11:34,790 --> 03:11:36,350
Also, buy Scuttle.

2964
03:11:36,590 --> 03:11:37,990
Should I save it for something?

2965
03:11:41,650 --> 03:11:42,610
What's over here?

2966
03:11:42,730 --> 03:11:44,530
Why does it want me to go here?

2967
03:11:45,910 --> 03:11:47,170
Is there anything here?

2968
03:11:51,330 --> 03:11:51,850
Alright.

2969
03:11:52,310 --> 03:11:53,370
Oh, I can reach... Okay.

2970
03:11:55,070 --> 03:11:57,750
Your learning is a unique technique spawn of Cogward Hearts.

2971
03:11:59,830 --> 03:12:00,410
on my part.

2972
03:12:01,150 --> 03:12:01,650
Bugred.

2973
03:12:02,030 --> 03:12:04,250
You are the first organic shell to fuse our memories.

2974
03:12:04,750 --> 03:12:05,950
Such behavior.

2975
03:12:06,190 --> 03:12:08,370
My line would believe it is impossible.

2976
03:12:09,170 --> 03:12:16,710
So your broad arsenal did suggest strong affinity with the mechanical craft and that's allowed access to your thought store.

2977
03:12:17,390 --> 03:12:19,330
Versus an impressive skill, master.

2978
03:12:19,890 --> 03:12:21,190
I'm grateful for the insight.

2979
03:12:22,190 --> 03:12:22,470
Okay.

2980
03:12:22,710 --> 03:12:23,950
No, I'm not spending my money.

2981
03:12:24,070 --> 03:12:24,970
I know what it is.

2982
03:12:25,570 --> 03:12:26,550
I've seen it.

2983
03:12:26,650 --> 03:12:27,390
I saw it on Twitter.

2984
03:12:27,950 --> 03:12:28,430
It's okay.

2985
03:12:29,250 --> 03:12:29,810
Okay.

2986
03:12:30,350 --> 03:12:32,870

3031
03:15:14,380 --> 03:15:15,100

03:15:16,920 --> 03:15:18,140

I fucking knew I'm always missing things.

3041
03:16:13,140 --> 03:16:13,980

03:16:14,120 --> 03:16:15,140

03:16:35,810 --> 03:16:35,810
Goodbye.

3048
03:16:36,110 --> 03:16:37,910

3049
03:16:42,180 --> 03:16:42,180
Okay.

3053
03:16:46,180 --> 03:16:47,160
All the way down.

3054
03:16:47,380 --> 03:16:47,580
Alright.

03:16:53,400 --> 03:16:54,500
I forgot they existed.

3058
03:16:55,900 --> 03:16:56,240
Alright.

3059
03:16:58,240 --> 03:16:58,840

3060
03:16:59,840 --> 03:17:00,840
Just faster.

3061
03:17:01,420 --> 03:17:04,380
I guess we'll go here this should not be that bad.

3062
03:17:08,640 --> 03:17:10,100
Then we can go down from here.

3063
03:17:13,800 --> 03:17:15,500
Oh my god, wait, I just don't like...

3064
03:17:15,500 --> 03:17:17,020
Oh my god, I don't like the Pogo.

3065
03:17:19,860 --> 03:17:21,940
Guys, I might not like the Pogo.

3066
03:17:22,440 --> 03:17:23,200
Oh my god!

3067
03:17:23,480 --> 03:17:24,480
Oh my god!

3068
03:17:33,740 --> 03:17:37,820
It's almost perfect, except for the fact that the Pogo...

3069
03:17:37,820 --> 03:17:40,520
I told you, it's pretty ass.

3070
03:17:41,060 --> 03:17:44,920
Wait, how many lost fleas?

3071
03:17:45,140 --> 03:17:47,640
It seems even the last few stragglers are now with us.

3072
03:17:48,120 --> 03:17:49,120
That is well, Flea Master.

3073
03:17:49,320 --> 03:17:51,200
My travels through this land have been far and deep.

3074
03:17:51,520 --> 03:17:54,560
Yet almost every reach, I met the friendly, inquisitive presence of your kind.

3075
03:17:54,960 --> 03:17:58,100
Your fleas have an uncommon desire for adventure, which I find admirable.

3076
03:17:58,500 --> 03:18:00,020
Even a seldom match by capability.

3077
03:18:01,180 --> 03:18:07,920
Though I am not accustomed to traveling alone, following your journey and sharing some pride of this progress has been a warm thing.

3078
03:18:11,120 --> 03:18:11,600
too.

3079
03:18:12,140 --> 03:18:12,740

3081
03:18:14,060 --> 03:18:15,200
Have you made me fleas?

3082
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:18,380
I would be honored to bestow one final gift onto you.

3083
03:18:18,480 --> 03:18:22,260
Miss Chalernet, a treasure from three kinds glorious past.

3084
03:18:22,780 --> 03:18:25,040

03:18:25,500 --> 03:18:25,960
Oh, nice.

03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:27,600

3094
03:18:44,600 --> 03:18:44,860
Yay!

3095
03:18:48,240 --> 03:18:48,680

3098
03:18:54,140 --> 03:18:54,580

Okay.

3109
03:19:16,100 --> 03:19:16,940
All right.

03:19:21,340 --> 03:19:23,160

3115
03:19:35,680 --> 03:19:37,000

03:23:31,440 --> 03:23:33,760
I guess, bring me back down.

3165
03:23:33,960 --> 03:23:35,100
Sorry, it was never over.

3166
03:23:37,200 --> 03:23:39,520
Lady, if you and your travelers were able...

3167
03:23:39,520 --> 03:23:39,720
What?

3168
03:23:39,800 --> 03:23:41,340
No, I don't.

3169
03:23:41,400 --> 03:23:42,720
What the fuck are you talking about?

3170
03:23:43,900 --> 03:23:45,900
What the fuck are you talking about, guys?

3171
03:23:51,410 --> 03:23:52,850
Back up.

3172
03:23:59,040 --> 03:23:59,520
Yeah.

3173
03:24:04,060 --> 03:24:07,540
Alright, nice.

3174
03:24:12,740 --> 03:24:13,080
Yes.

3175
03:24:15,100 --> 03:24:16,440
Alright, is that everything?

3176
03:24:16,760 --> 03:24:17,940
Did I finish my filler?

3177
03:24:22,980 --> 03:24:25,980
Go down a third time just for fun.

3178
03:24:31,120 --> 03:24:32,280
Breakable wall?

3179
03:24:35,100 --> 03:24:36,860
Alejandro, welcome to tomato farm.

3180
03:24:37,180 --> 03:24:37,700
Welcome, welcome.

3181
03:24:38,400 --> 03:24:39,000
Where is this?

3182
03:24:39,220 --> 03:24:41,740
Okay, what does the breakable wall bring me before I go down?

3183
03:24:43,060 --> 03:24:44,780
I shall negotiate one more time.

3184
03:24:45,540 --> 03:24:46,720
What does it grant me?

3185
03:24:58,380 --> 03:24:59,300
There's a mask?

3186
03:24:59,420 --> 03:25:02,880
Okay, I swear to God, then if you, there's no mask, you're gonna get banned.

3187
03:25:06,900 --> 03:25:08,500
I swear to God, are you ready?

3188
03:25:08,780 --> 03:25:10,560
Are you willing to bet your life on it, Dex?

3189
03:25:11,020 --> 03:25:11,540
Are you willing?

3190
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:15,160
I bet your entire life.

3191
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:19,080
This is...

3192
03:25:20,660 --> 03:25:22,100
This is your life.

3193
03:25:23,220 --> 03:25:23,340
Oh.

3194
03:25:24,780 --> 03:25:26,660
She already got the one.

3195
03:25:28,200 --> 03:25:29,520
Godspeed dragon.

3196
03:25:30,880 --> 03:25:31,540
Okay.

3197
03:25:32,120 --> 03:25:33,400
Say yes, bro.

3198
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:34,900
Yeah, why not?

3199
03:25:34,920 --> 03:25:36,520
Alright, where is the breakable wall?

3200
03:25:37,220 --> 03:25:38,340
Where is it?

3201
03:25:38,380 --> 03:25:40,220
Alright, he's betting his entire life.

3202
03:25:41,580 --> 03:25:42,660
Alright, where is it?

3203
03:25:54,080 --> 03:25:56,160
That's a bold strategy.

3204
03:25:56,520 --> 03:25:59,780
It was, you know, open face off.

3205
03:25:59,920 --> 03:26:01,160
I already got it.

3206
03:26:01,400 --> 03:26:01,560
All right.

3207
03:26:02,360 --> 03:26:02,680
All right.

3208
03:26:03,360 --> 03:26:05,920
He was right that there was one, but I already got it.

3209
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:07,680
So that's just a, that's a timeout.

3210
03:26:07,860 --> 03:26:09,260
You can, you are in a timeout corner.

3211
03:26:09,680 --> 03:26:16,700
You're, give him a 30 minute timeout so he can think about his actions.

3212
03:26:17,100 --> 03:26:17,320
Really?

3213
03:26:23,920 --> 03:26:33,220

Alright.

3216
03:26:56,320 --> 03:26:57,620
How do I get there again?

3217
03:26:57,840 --> 03:26:58,700
You don't remember.

3218
03:26:59,460 --> 03:27:00,700
Boop, boop, boop.

3219
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:02,260
Jesus Christ.

3220
03:27:03,620 --> 03:27:04,360
Alright, I'll go.

3221
03:27:05,200 --> 03:27:06,420
I still don't remember.

3222
03:27:07,060 --> 03:27:09,860
I looked at it and then I still got confused.

3223
03:27:15,760 --> 03:27:16,720
There's a tool there.

3224
03:27:16,800 --> 03:27:17,980
How the fuck do I get the tool?

3225
03:27:19,960 --> 03:27:21,000
Oh, no.

3226
03:27:23,620 --> 03:27:24,180
Wee.

3227
03:27:25,320 --> 03:27:26,240
Oh, hey, money.

3228
03:27:26,260 --> 03:27:28,000
Yeah, I'll take those.

3229
03:27:28,420 --> 03:27:32,840
I don't have a magnet, so the rest will just fall down to the pilgrims because they need it more than me.

3230
03:27:34,380 --> 03:27:35,880
Oh, I have a Weaver effigy.

3231
03:27:35,980 --> 03:27:36,940
The fuck is that?

3232
03:27:48,060 --> 03:27:48,500
Wee!

3233
03:27:51,220 --> 03:27:52,640
Just float over here.

3234
03:27:52,800 --> 03:27:53,560
I'm too lazy.

3235
03:27:55,740 --> 03:27:56,860
Oh, where am I?

3236
03:27:57,280 --> 03:27:58,160
Oh, it's here.

3237
03:27:58,480 --> 03:27:58,480
Okay.

3238
03:27:59,760 --> 03:28:00,660
Wait, what's here?

3239
03:28:03,100 --> 03:28:04,740
Some parkour shit here.

3240
03:28:07,720 --> 03:28:09,160
Okay, I've seen this area before.

3241
03:28:11,100 --> 03:28:12,280
Oh, it's this area.

3242
03:28:12,660 --> 03:28:13,580
I still haven't seen this.

3243
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:14,680
Oh my god.

3244
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:17,380
Oh my god, I can hit by everything.

3245
03:28:18,760 --> 03:28:19,640
That's fine.

3246
03:28:20,740 --> 03:28:21,860
All right, we're in way.

3247
03:28:26,720 --> 03:28:27,240
What?

3248
03:28:31,300 --> 03:28:32,400
Can I just kill these?

3249
03:28:34,740 --> 03:28:35,880
I don't think I can.

3250
03:28:36,940 --> 03:28:37,560
Oh wait, I can't.

3251
03:28:37,580 --> 03:28:38,280
Thanks

3252
03:28:41,540 --> 03:28:44,220
Oh my god, it's fine when

3253
03:28:50,040 --> 03:28:53,200
Yeah, oh my god, it's also fine I can farm these guys

3254
03:28:57,860 --> 03:29:00,300
I'll just farm these guys for silk fuck it

3255
03:29:07,160 --> 03:29:15,340
Come on, God it takes so long It takes so long to farm them for silk.

3256
03:29:18,440 --> 03:29:19,480
Okay, nice.

3257
03:29:23,300 --> 03:29:25,820
Yeah, I don't have the wanderer equipment right now.

3258
03:29:27,200 --> 03:29:28,060
Oh my god, it's fine.

3259
03:29:30,960 --> 03:29:31,480
I think it's here?

3260
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:31,880
Yeah.

3261
03:29:36,020 --> 03:29:36,960
Alright, Apako.

3262
03:29:38,540 --> 03:29:38,640
Oh.

3263
03:29:39,740 --> 03:29:41,080
We're going up.

3264
03:29:50,860 --> 03:29:51,580
All right.

3265
03:29:52,760 --> 03:29:53,280
I've been here.

3266
03:29:53,380 --> 03:29:54,220
I have not been here.

3267
03:29:55,080 --> 03:29:55,500
What am I seeing?

3268
03:29:55,760 --> 03:29:56,540
Of course I haven't been here.

3269
03:29:58,240 --> 03:29:58,940
What the fuck?

3270
03:30:00,140 --> 03:30:00,940
Get out of here.

3271
03:30:01,880 --> 03:30:02,600
That's right.

3272
03:30:03,540 --> 03:30:04,680
No surprise attack.

3273
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:05,280
What are you going to do?

3274
03:30:05,340 --> 03:30:06,440
Oh my god, he's just going to jump.

3275
03:30:07,120 --> 03:30:08,860
I was like, what are you going to do?

3276
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:09,880
Anyway.

3277
03:30:10,700 --> 03:30:11,060
Okay.

3278
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:14,080
You can't get here.

3279
03:30:14,100 --> 03:30:15,800
I have spikes and then he jumped.

3280
03:30:16,020 --> 03:30:19,460
And I was like, oh, that's what you're gonna do.

3281
03:30:23,480 --> 03:30:25,240
That wasn't too bad.

3282
03:30:25,520 --> 03:30:26,040
That's it?

3283
03:30:29,280 --> 03:30:30,720
Daughter of a distant land.

3284
03:30:31,220 --> 03:30:32,860
We who remain have waited long.

3285
03:30:33,480 --> 03:30:37,480
Find our strength to yours and reclaim the future of our haunted kingdom.

3286
03:30:38,780 --> 03:30:39,080
All right.

3287
03:30:39,220 --> 03:30:39,860
Bye, Pam.

3288
03:30:41,800 --> 03:30:42,400
Yay!

3289
03:30:44,100 --> 03:30:45,080
What did I get?

3290
03:30:47,160 --> 03:30:48,360
Sharp dart.

3291
03:30:49,440 --> 03:30:51,480
Peers through enemies in a blur of blades.

3292
03:30:51,960 --> 03:30:52,120
Oh.

3293
03:30:52,440 --> 03:30:53,340
Do I get...

3294
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:54,060
I frames?

3295
03:30:55,100 --> 03:30:56,940
Oh, it's a sharp shadow.

3296
03:30:57,200 --> 03:30:57,500
Yeah.

3297
03:30:58,500 --> 03:30:59,720
Do I get eye frames for this?

3298
03:31:05,420 --> 03:31:06,020
Yeah?

3299
03:31:06,960 --> 03:31:08,060
Oh, I do.

3300
03:31:08,520 --> 03:31:08,920
Nice.

3301
03:31:11,060 --> 03:31:11,660
Whoops.

3302
03:31:13,380 --> 03:31:14,260
Okay, that's cool.

3303
03:31:14,280 --> 03:31:14,560
Cool.

3304
03:31:17,440 --> 03:31:17,760
Yay!

3305
03:31:18,240 --> 03:31:19,520
Eye frame's always nice.

3306
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:21,720
Jesus.

3307
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:24,120
Okay, guys, chill.

3308
03:31:28,480 --> 03:31:33,580
Yeah, I can't eye frame the goddamn floor, apparently.

3309
03:31:38,200 --> 03:31:40,000
And then I gotta go here.

3310
03:31:42,120 --> 03:31:43,320
I assume...

3311
03:31:46,840 --> 03:31:48,380
Jesus, I even see these guys.

3312
03:31:49,320 --> 03:31:49,840
Okay.

3313
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:51,720
What do I do with this?

3314
03:31:53,040 --> 03:31:54,620
Because you might have to go up.

3315
03:32:03,180 --> 03:32:04,380
Am I going the right way?

3316
03:32:04,680 --> 03:32:05,520
I think so.

3317
03:32:06,220 --> 03:32:06,740
Jesus.

3318
03:32:07,500 --> 03:32:08,400
They're so annoying.

3319
03:32:12,730 --> 03:32:13,030
Oh.

3320
03:32:13,610 --> 03:32:14,130
Is it him?

3321
03:32:14,550 --> 03:32:15,110
I don't see.

3322
03:32:17,190 --> 03:32:18,230
Oh, wait.

3323
03:32:21,030 --> 03:32:22,150
I knew Chase.

3324
03:32:22,850 --> 03:32:24,070
Now I hear the body.

3325
03:32:24,310 --> 03:32:24,850
I could.

3326
03:32:25,150 --> 03:32:26,350
I couldn't go.

3327
03:32:26,370 --> 03:32:32,450
Charity's underway, the twisting tunnel is enough for no distractions.

3328
03:32:35,690 --> 03:32:39,050
You have a red suncoat, my sister's by chance.

3329
03:32:40,130 --> 03:32:45,310
And it'll illustrate, short-servantly, rather unreliably seeming.

3330
03:32:46,750 --> 03:32:50,290
In a dark cave below here, I encountered a shell not dissimilar from your own.

3331
03:32:50,850 --> 03:32:53,530
I suspect your assistant may have met an unfortunate end.

3332
03:32:56,370 --> 03:33:26,790
for fun no surprise then that lump never shung with a talent for tool discovery now my wake-up must return with my assistant show really dying on me i touched it down for two bugs unless you have further interest in my precious plasmium gotta leave me in my peace okay let me sit down real fast nerd Yeah.

3333
03:33:28,270 --> 03:33:31,370
I'm curious about the equipment you have here, and the blue liquid contained within.

3334
03:33:31,970 --> 03:33:33,170
Sadi consumes you.

3335
03:33:33,690 --> 03:33:34,270
Ah, yes.

3336
03:33:34,730 --> 03:33:37,590
To this miraculous substance intrigues you too.

3337
03:33:38,130 --> 03:33:40,190
I wonder beyond wonders.

3338
03:33:40,630 --> 03:33:42,950
A miracle made miracle.

3339
03:33:43,850 --> 03:33:44,850
Clash Minium.

3340
03:33:45,430 --> 03:33:47,730
A natural accumulation with no equal.

3341
03:33:48,490 --> 03:33:50,410
A healer wounds and shrinking shells.

3342
03:33:50,850 --> 03:33:53,130
I expect you can even defy death itself.

3343
03:33:53,450 --> 03:33:53,970
That's fine.

3344
03:33:54,690 --> 03:33:55,670
Clash Minium, Colin.

3345
03:33:56,370 --> 03:34:23,310
her like before or else there's a sense of remarkable similarity the highly unlikely the gray and berry soil of the mainland could never produce something as similar as this and that is a just beautiful fact and by his meaning it was discovered by my master at the fire that's a volume hidden deep in a salt-stricken walkers i brought it to these caves under her direction

3346
03:34:26,370 --> 03:34:27,110
four in place.

3347
03:34:28,210 --> 03:34:29,250
I hashtag myself.

3348
03:34:29,430 --> 03:34:32,770
You have been bewitched by the Blast Medium Blue Film Club.

3349
03:34:33,810 --> 03:34:36,790
And you are sent them to assist me in my studies.

3350
03:34:37,490 --> 03:34:37,630
Sure.

3351
03:34:38,650 --> 03:34:39,410
What do I have to do?

3352
03:34:42,370 --> 03:34:43,130
Because he's a nerd.

3353
03:34:44,090 --> 03:34:45,450
Still has his voices on.

3354
03:34:46,270 --> 03:34:46,790
I shouldn't.

3355
03:34:46,850 --> 03:34:49,130
With two bugs I test, there ain't good discovery.

3356
03:34:49,630 --> 03:34:54,690
Now, before he went and died, did I have my previous assistant see that the war is below?

3357
03:34:54,790 --> 03:34:56,250
With Blast Medium Bads.

3358
03:34:56,930 --> 03:35:03,910
The buds should be rifling as you see, and the weaver nectar within must be extracted before they reach maturity.

3359
03:35:04,590 --> 03:35:08,350
With the right to one claw, collecting the nectar is easy for success.

3360
03:35:09,290 --> 03:35:12,490
I even lend you my own needle file for the job.

3361
03:35:13,170 --> 03:35:16,830
Once you locate a bud, simply charge the file until ready.

3362
03:35:17,510 --> 03:35:20,030
Then release its needles into a bud's core.

3363
03:35:20,630 --> 03:35:23,570
Do it right, and they'll suck out the nectar in one cream pop.

3364
03:35:24,050 --> 03:35:26,350
Return them to me when you treat the necessary things.

3365
03:35:26,370 --> 03:35:27,010
samples.

3366
03:35:27,750 --> 03:35:33,290
If the right nectar and the right testing, Flash Minim can reveal even more of his wondrous properties.

3367
03:35:34,410 --> 03:35:34,970
Alright.

3368
03:35:35,870 --> 03:35:37,090
Don't need us.

3369
03:35:37,830 --> 03:35:38,050
Okay.

3370
03:35:38,850 --> 03:35:39,970
Wait, how do I do it?

3371
03:35:43,190 --> 03:35:43,750
Uh...

3372
03:35:45,490 --> 03:35:46,670
What the fuck?

3373
03:35:47,170 --> 03:35:48,450
The Pierce...

3374
03:35:48,450 --> 03:35:51,390
You must first be charged to full attention.

3375
03:35:51,550 --> 03:35:51,830
Okay.

3376
03:35:54,110 --> 03:35:56,350
Alright, we gotta find the buds, I guess.

3377
03:35:56,370 --> 03:35:58,570
I don't even know where they are.

3378
03:35:58,770 --> 03:35:59,810
It's been so long.

3379
03:36:00,930 --> 03:36:01,410
Ow.

3380
03:36:01,810 --> 03:36:03,370
I mean, lucky me, I guess.

3381
03:36:05,670 --> 03:36:06,710
There are any up here?

3382
03:36:10,530 --> 03:36:11,910
Wait, where am I now?

3383
03:36:13,750 --> 03:36:15,210
Oh, I'm out of a shortcut.

3384
03:36:24,460 --> 03:36:26,860
I don't even remember where it is.

3385
03:36:28,140 --> 03:36:30,440
Guys, it's... I feel like...

3386
03:36:30,440 --> 03:36:32,660
I don't remember where it is.

3387
03:36:32,740 --> 03:36:33,480
Oh, there is one.

3388
03:36:33,500 --> 03:36:34,360
Oh, there's one.

3389
03:36:37,700 --> 03:36:38,400
There we go.

3390
03:36:38,580 --> 03:36:39,400
Sucky, sucky.

3391
03:36:39,620 --> 03:36:40,480
How much do I need to get?

3392
03:36:43,480 --> 03:36:44,720
Oh, two out of three?

3393
03:36:45,380 --> 03:36:45,960
There's one.

3394
03:36:46,140 --> 03:36:47,420
They're all in that cave.

3395
03:36:47,600 --> 03:36:48,100
What cave?

3396
03:36:49,360 --> 03:36:49,760
All right.

3397
03:36:50,280 --> 03:36:52,020
Two in lower left area.

3398
03:36:52,120 --> 03:36:54,000
Okay, so I have to go lower left.

3399
03:36:54,280 --> 03:36:55,320
So I have to go this way.

3400
03:36:55,920 --> 03:36:56,380
It's fine.

3401
03:36:57,600 --> 03:36:59,280
See, Bago, they give us super chat.

3402
03:36:59,360 --> 03:36:59,600
Thank you.

3403
03:36:59,680 --> 03:37:00,240
Thank you.

3404
03:37:00,460 --> 03:37:03,880
So a bald scientist in a secret lab needs us to help him make his blue drugs.

3405
03:37:04,100 --> 03:37:04,500
I see you.

3406
03:37:04,580 --> 03:37:05,680
I didn't break.

3407
03:37:07,140 --> 03:37:07,420
Alright.

3408
03:37:08,700 --> 03:37:11,580
It's like, where did the assistant die?

3409
03:37:12,660 --> 03:37:13,920
I don't remember.

3410
03:37:14,920 --> 03:37:16,100
Where's the other one?

3411
03:37:18,720 --> 03:37:19,980
Where are the other two?

3412
03:37:20,800 --> 03:37:23,420
I don't remember when I found an assistant.

3413
03:37:29,080 --> 03:37:29,560
Here?

3414
03:37:30,520 --> 03:37:31,420
Is it this one?

3415
03:37:32,580 --> 03:37:33,080
Alright.

3416
03:37:34,240 --> 03:37:35,580
Is that all of them?

3417
03:37:38,860 --> 03:37:41,380
I'm just like, I don't remember how he died.

3418
03:37:45,710 --> 03:37:45,830
Okay.

3419
03:37:48,490 --> 03:37:49,710
Put it down.

3420
03:37:53,140 --> 03:37:54,540
And it should be...

3421
03:37:54,540 --> 03:37:56,280
Oh my god, get it out of here.

3422
03:37:58,100 --> 03:37:59,080
There we go.

3423
03:37:59,980 --> 03:38:01,700
This must be where he died.

3424
03:38:02,800 --> 03:38:05,440
Oh my god, I vaguely remembered this place.

3425
03:38:05,480 --> 03:38:06,620
This place fucking sucks.

3426
03:38:08,800 --> 03:38:09,940
Are you serious?

3427
03:38:10,200 --> 03:38:12,760
Oh my god, that's right, get out of here.

3428
03:38:15,180 --> 03:38:16,220
There we go.

3429
03:38:17,420 --> 03:38:18,640
Oh wait, I see the blue plants.

3430
03:38:21,260 --> 03:38:22,620
Oh, there it is.

3431
03:38:23,320 --> 03:38:23,700
Whoops.

3432
03:38:26,760 --> 03:38:27,640
Sucky, sucky.

3433
03:38:28,400 --> 03:38:28,660
Alright.

3434
03:38:29,800 --> 03:38:31,540
Then you should have one more here.

3435
03:38:33,760 --> 03:38:35,280
Where's the neck here?

3436
03:38:37,120 --> 03:38:38,120
Where is it?

3437
03:38:38,940 --> 03:38:40,180
I'm still missing one more.

3438
03:38:40,200 --> 03:38:40,600
more.

3439
03:38:42,900 --> 03:38:44,100
Wait, where's the next one?

3440
03:38:48,140 --> 03:38:49,520
Guys, where's the next one?

3441
03:38:56,520 --> 03:38:57,080
Right.

3442
03:38:59,960 --> 03:39:00,700
To the right?

3443
03:39:01,420 --> 03:39:01,760
Here?

3444
03:39:09,220 --> 03:39:10,240
Is it here?

3445
03:39:10,660 --> 03:39:11,560
Or here?

3446
03:39:14,040 --> 03:39:15,480
No, he was dead, dead.

3447
03:39:15,580 --> 03:39:17,740
We saw him died a long time ago.

3448
03:39:19,680 --> 03:39:20,720
Oh, just search it.

3449
03:39:20,740 --> 03:39:21,940
Oh, it's still in the big room.

3450
03:39:22,260 --> 03:39:25,060
No, we saw this guy died a very long time ago.

3451
03:39:25,120 --> 03:39:26,400
I remember seeing his body.

3452
03:39:34,430 --> 03:39:34,950
There we go.

3453
03:39:40,420 --> 03:39:41,040
Oh my god.

3454
03:39:41,160 --> 03:39:42,840
I hate all of them so much.

3455
03:39:44,740 --> 03:39:46,320
I hate, and I hate the Cs, too.

3456
03:39:47,860 --> 03:39:50,720
This entire area is just actual hell.

3457
03:39:53,340 --> 03:39:54,500
Actually, stop.

3458
03:39:54,660 --> 03:39:55,780
Why do they keep coming?

3459
03:39:56,760 --> 03:39:58,140
They don't stop coming.

3460
03:40:00,620 --> 03:40:01,540
No, I...

3461
03:40:01,540 --> 03:40:02,620
Oh, it's not here.

3462
03:40:05,040 --> 03:40:07,680
My body is just filled with hate, and it's not here.

3463
03:40:07,980 --> 03:40:09,680
God damn it, where the fuck is it?

3464
03:40:14,740 --> 03:40:15,820
Are you serious?

3465
03:40:15,960 --> 03:40:16,980
And then the fucking...

3466
03:40:16,980 --> 03:40:18,780
Oh my god, he comboed me.

3467
03:40:27,240 --> 03:40:29,420
Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

3468
03:40:30,440 --> 03:40:33,220
We were not supposed to go...

3469
03:40:33,800 --> 03:40:35,800
Wait, isn't this where I just came from?

3470
03:40:35,880 --> 03:40:36,480
This is where I just...

3471
03:40:36,480 --> 03:40:37,640
Oh my god, they're infinite spawning.

3472
03:40:37,780 --> 03:40:38,560
I just realized that.

3473
03:40:40,440 --> 03:40:42,720
It's in the same room?

3474
03:40:42,880 --> 03:40:43,920
I don't see them.

3475
03:40:46,640 --> 03:40:48,600
Is it in the same room as I found it?

3476
03:40:48,680 --> 03:40:50,140
This is where I found it.

3477
03:40:51,820 --> 03:40:54,300
Right here, but there's nothing else here.

3478
03:40:55,140 --> 03:40:55,880
It's just a plant.

3479
03:40:57,560 --> 03:40:58,200
See?

3480
03:40:58,200 --> 03:41:00,160
No plant for you.

3481
03:41:02,820 --> 03:41:04,140
Nothing in here.

3482
03:41:09,870 --> 03:41:11,510
It's more right.

3483
03:41:13,750 --> 03:41:15,190
It's not here.

3484
03:41:21,330 --> 03:41:22,590
Oh my god, there's two of them now.

3485
03:41:22,870 --> 03:41:23,590
There's two of them.

3486
03:41:25,170 --> 03:41:26,570
Maybe I go this way?

3487
03:41:29,890 --> 03:41:31,610
That's why you can't catch me now.

3488
03:41:33,570 --> 03:41:35,650
And when you see here, maybe it's down here.

3489
03:41:36,650 --> 03:41:36,990
Maybe?

3490
03:41:40,790 --> 03:41:42,170
I'm farming for silk.

3491
03:41:43,150 --> 03:41:43,830
I need silk.

3492
03:41:47,980 --> 03:41:48,460
Okay.

3493
03:41:49,400 --> 03:41:50,240
The slow farm.

3494
03:41:54,920 --> 03:41:55,300
Man.

3495
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:58,120
We're almost there.

3496
03:41:59,460 --> 03:42:00,460
We're almost there.

3497
03:42:01,040 --> 03:42:01,620
There we go.

3498
03:42:03,200 --> 03:42:03,660
Maybe here?

3499
03:42:04,200 --> 03:42:04,780
Oh, my god.

3500
03:42:05,000 --> 03:42:06,060
There was- it was a dead end.

3501
03:42:06,200 --> 03:42:06,820
It was just bait.

3502
03:42:07,340 --> 03:42:08,360
A forking course.

3503
03:42:08,500 --> 03:42:09,000
It's just bait.

3504
03:42:09,160 --> 03:42:09,980
Oh, a fucking course.

3505
03:42:10,100 --> 03:42:12,940
Everything is just bait in this cruel world.

3506
03:42:13,320 --> 03:42:14,060
It's all bait.

3507
03:42:14,320 --> 03:42:15,400
Everything is just bait.

3508
03:42:15,900 --> 03:42:16,420
Okay.

3509
03:42:28,690 --> 03:42:29,210
Okay.

3510
03:42:33,080 --> 03:42:34,360
Oh my god.

3511
03:42:35,280 --> 03:42:36,240
This place sucks.

3512
03:42:36,980 --> 03:42:38,320
I hate this place.

3513
03:42:38,580 --> 03:42:40,120
Okay, it's not here.

3514
03:42:41,800 --> 03:42:44,880
I went down here too.

3515
03:42:48,720 --> 03:42:50,260
Are you sure it's in this room?

3516
03:42:51,520 --> 03:42:52,900
Like, I went everywhere.

3517
03:42:54,680 --> 03:42:56,900
I went here before I remember.

3518
03:42:58,100 --> 03:43:00,120
Yeah, because this is where that monk was.

3519
03:43:01,720 --> 03:43:03,780
Yeah, follow the blue...

3520
03:43:03,780 --> 03:43:05,100
Are you sure there's two here?

3521
03:43:09,530 --> 03:43:12,570
I feel like it's here, isn't it?

3522
03:43:16,270 --> 03:43:16,750
Yeah.

3523
03:43:21,060 --> 03:43:21,640
I knew it.

3524
03:43:21,700 --> 03:43:24,100
I knew you guys didn't know either.

3525
03:43:27,000 --> 03:43:27,600
I knew it.

3526
03:43:27,720 --> 03:43:29,780
I fucking knew you guys didn't know either.

3527
03:43:30,520 --> 03:43:33,280
I know I went through everything in here.

3528
03:43:40,080 --> 03:43:40,680
I knew it.

3529
03:43:40,700 --> 03:43:43,420
I was like, there's no way there's two in this room.

3530
03:43:47,560 --> 03:43:50,120
Okay, someone said here.

3531
03:43:52,640 --> 03:43:54,380
I fucking knew it.

3532
03:43:54,580 --> 03:44:00,080
I fucking thought I knew I should have trusted myself.

3533
03:44:00,700 --> 03:44:01,480
I knew it.

3534
03:44:01,500 --> 03:44:03,080
I knew it was in that room.

3535
03:44:03,380 --> 03:44:05,160
I was like, I guess you're not in this room.

3536
03:44:05,660 --> 03:44:08,100
I was like, I fucking knew it.

3537
03:44:08,180 --> 03:44:09,940
You guys, yeah, fuck it.

3538
03:44:10,700 --> 03:44:11,420
I'd kill it.

3539
03:44:14,740 --> 03:44:16,940
We were like, no, there's two in that room, Doki.

3540
03:44:17,460 --> 03:44:17,840
Trust me.

3541
03:44:17,960 --> 03:44:19,360
This is why I have trust issues.

3542
03:44:19,960 --> 03:44:21,760
This is exactly why.

3543
03:44:25,830 --> 03:44:26,990
Oh my god.

3544
03:44:28,890 --> 03:44:30,530
Grab more stuff from these guys.

3545
03:44:33,070 --> 03:44:34,370
They're like, no, there's two.

3546
03:44:34,510 --> 03:44:36,390
I swear, there's two in that room.

3547
03:44:37,530 --> 03:44:38,950
Like, I should, all right.

3548
03:44:40,690 --> 03:44:42,930
Demon chat doesn't trust chat.

3549
03:44:44,810 --> 03:44:46,370
It should have known.

3550
03:44:55,620 --> 03:44:56,380
Oh my gosh, what?

3551
03:44:57,940 --> 03:44:58,720
What the fuck?

3552
03:44:58,760 --> 03:44:59,940
Why can't I do this jump?

3553
03:45:06,570 --> 03:45:07,330
There we go.

3554
03:45:09,170 --> 03:45:11,070
I was like wondering why I couldn't do that jump.

3555
03:45:12,350 --> 03:45:13,270
It worked before.

3556
03:45:16,710 --> 03:45:17,570
It's fine.

3557
03:45:17,790 --> 03:45:18,870
I don't care anymore.

3558
03:45:22,350 --> 03:45:23,330
Crushed no one.

3559
03:45:24,010 --> 03:45:24,550
Hello.

3560
03:45:26,930 --> 03:45:28,430
Are you sure how those will work?

3561
03:45:28,910 --> 03:45:31,970
Have you extracted a sufficient amount of Plasminium for him?

3562
03:45:32,470 --> 03:45:32,810
Yes.

3563
03:45:33,170 --> 03:45:33,830
There you go.

3564
03:45:35,030 --> 03:45:39,350
Ah, he's actually not a kind amount of satisfactory effort, Assistant.

3565
03:45:40,610 --> 03:45:46,770
Or is the spare Plasminium extracted as he finally comes to understand this wondrous substance?

3566
03:45:48,250 --> 03:45:48,790
Money!

3567
03:45:49,510 --> 03:45:50,190
One last round.

3568
03:45:50,290 --> 03:45:51,110
Thank you for the super chat.

3569
03:45:51,190 --> 03:45:52,150
Thank you, thank you.

3570
03:45:52,390 --> 03:45:52,750
Thank you.

3571
03:45:52,910 --> 03:45:53,350
Thank you.

3572
03:45:53,470 --> 03:45:57,250
You have to bring yourself a capable assistant.

3573
03:45:57,890 --> 03:46:01,270
Take this delightful implement of my own invention.

3574
03:46:01,690 --> 03:46:03,070
A plasminium fial.

3575
03:46:03,630 --> 03:46:08,830
Or that you can extract precious bad mania straight into your body.

3576
03:46:09,450 --> 03:46:10,350
Almost painlessly.

3577
03:46:11,270 --> 03:46:13,530
Your true discerning looks sharp enough to pierce my shell, sir.

3578
03:46:13,890 --> 03:46:15,310
Why would I want to do so?

3579
03:46:15,810 --> 03:46:19,350
Because filling your body with plasminium is so inefficient.

3580
03:46:19,890 --> 03:46:21,230
It protects you from harm.

3581
03:46:21,450 --> 03:46:23,450
And it feels so unequivocally good.

3582
03:46:23,470 --> 03:46:23,950
Good.

3583
03:46:25,490 --> 03:46:31,230
I am such a good, I've been injecting Plasminium into the local fauna and fauna since we arrived.

3584
03:46:31,610 --> 03:46:33,350
No effects have been observed.

3585
03:46:33,790 --> 03:46:37,550
So we can conclude that the process is hardly completely safe.

3586
03:46:38,410 --> 03:46:43,530
Keep using the Plasminium file and enjoy all the wonderful effects it has here on your body.

3587
03:46:44,450 --> 03:46:50,950
If you ever run out on Plasminium, be seen again, I'll charge up your groceries for refills.

3588
03:46:51,750 --> 03:47:05,830
You can be confident every beat goes the words I've my touch that these okay cool no side effects what kind of drug is this wow that's crazy no side effects at all zero

3589
03:47:08,930 --> 03:47:52,810
wow who would have thought that that could be possible use it with the one day drug with no side effects that's crazy surely he's right yeah oh poison contaminates it rw thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you hey dokey bug did you hear about the lore of this game so like a thousand years ago after the tacos were assassinated queen stick but sink bug fought bravely against the map bugs but was ultimately defeated by douglas hugh the radiance and uh thank you for the akasupa thank you thank you okay we'll grab the cop guys first All right,

3590
03:47:52,910 --> 03:47:54,610
well, I mean, what do I have?

3591
03:47:54,970 --> 03:47:57,330
Okay, want me to try using it nine times?

3592
03:47:57,470 --> 03:47:57,980
I'll do it

3593
03:48:01,410 --> 03:48:04,250
Wait, the sitting on the bench resets it?

3594
03:48:12,060 --> 03:48:13,060
Oh, I need architect.

3595
03:48:13,760 --> 03:48:16,640
Oh Okay

3596
03:48:20,460 --> 03:48:21,300
All right, let's see.

3597
03:48:21,380 --> 03:48:22,680
Let's try it out

3598
03:48:30,500 --> 03:48:32,400
He's like oh that looks good.

3599
03:48:33,060 --> 03:48:33,060
Whoops.

3600
03:48:34,120 --> 03:48:34,140
What?

3601
03:48:36,720 --> 03:48:38,640
Um, forgot a craft.

3602
03:48:39,380 --> 03:48:40,860
Um, oh, I don't have enough.

3603
03:48:41,700 --> 03:48:42,260
Oh, fuck.

3604
03:48:42,620 --> 03:48:42,900
Oops.

3605
03:48:43,440 --> 03:48:45,160
I forgot one simple instructions.

3606
03:48:46,780 --> 03:48:47,280
Oh, my God.

3607
03:48:47,360 --> 03:48:48,560
I don't want him to hit me, though.

3608
03:48:49,920 --> 03:48:50,260
It's fine.

3609
03:48:50,340 --> 03:48:50,960
We'll have this.

3610
03:48:52,660 --> 03:48:53,740
I think I forgot something.

3611
03:48:56,000 --> 03:48:56,300
Okay.

3612
03:48:56,580 --> 03:48:57,540
Oh, my God.

3613
03:48:57,640 --> 03:48:59,040
Okay, it took a- Oh, my God.

3614
03:48:59,200 --> 03:49:00,700
Okay, it better be worth it, guys.

3615
03:49:03,740 --> 03:49:06,060
2, 4, 6, 8, 9.

3616
03:49:08,300 --> 03:49:10,240
Oh shit, what's that?

3617
03:49:11,580 --> 03:49:12,960
I don't know what that is.

3618
03:49:13,880 --> 03:49:14,500
What did I get?

3619
03:49:21,270 --> 03:49:22,550
Oh, I can regen now?

3620
03:49:22,670 --> 03:49:23,650
Let's try it.

3621
03:49:26,170 --> 03:49:28,050
Oh shit, yeah, it is regenning.

3622
03:49:28,270 --> 03:49:28,870
Is that forever?

3623
03:49:29,370 --> 03:49:31,270
So if I sit on a chair, does it reset?

3624
03:49:33,110 --> 03:49:34,410
I'm an addict now.

3625
03:49:35,050 --> 03:49:35,190
Yay.

3626
03:49:39,850 --> 03:49:40,290
Yeah?

3627
03:49:42,130 --> 03:49:43,350
I'm addicted

3628
03:49:46,990 --> 03:50:13,430
Whoa shit It resets when you bench or fast travel Okay Well goodbye Actually let's just get to the fast travel first Actually I vote Wait so it's not a Guys it's not a side effect Oh my god it's fine Do you think about it?

3629
03:50:13,550 --> 03:50:15,170
It's technically not a side effect.

3630
03:50:15,350 --> 03:50:16,470
Oh my god, we should...

3631
03:50:16,470 --> 03:50:17,390
Which way is faster?

3632
03:50:18,010 --> 03:50:18,390
Actually.

3633
03:50:20,910 --> 03:50:21,590
Uh...

3634
03:50:21,590 --> 03:50:22,950
Where am I?

3635
03:50:23,450 --> 03:50:23,890
Actually.

3636
03:50:25,030 --> 03:50:25,570
Uh...

3637
03:50:25,570 --> 03:50:27,250
Down and right.

3638
03:50:28,170 --> 03:50:28,850
Down...

3639
03:50:28,850 --> 03:50:29,190
Right.

3640
03:50:29,510 --> 03:50:30,410
The bone bottom.

3641
03:50:30,810 --> 03:50:31,550
Alright, we'll do that.

3642
03:50:32,390 --> 03:50:33,430
Bye, Pilgrims.

3643
03:50:38,240 --> 03:50:40,520
You regenerate, you're not important.

3644
03:50:42,600 --> 03:50:44,260
Yeah, it costs a lot of shards.

3645
03:50:44,860 --> 03:50:45,520
Oh, hey, look.

3646
03:50:46,740 --> 03:50:47,260
Oh, my God.

3647
03:50:47,340 --> 03:50:48,240
What is the range?

3648
03:50:48,640 --> 03:50:49,540
Wait, this range is...

3649
03:50:49,540 --> 03:50:50,860
Wait, I've never seen these guys before.

3650
03:50:51,620 --> 03:50:52,440
It's because I killed...

3651
03:50:52,440 --> 03:50:54,260
Oh, it's because I killed their natural predator.

3652
03:50:58,780 --> 03:50:59,580
It's fine.

3653
03:50:59,880 --> 03:51:01,680
He said no side effects, guys.

3654
03:51:02,320 --> 03:51:03,260
You not trust him?

3655
03:51:03,560 --> 03:51:05,180
You literally said no side effects.

3656
03:51:08,280 --> 03:51:08,680
Alright.

3657
03:51:09,100 --> 03:51:11,040
Now we should be ready to go.

3658
03:51:11,160 --> 03:51:12,200
We got everything, right?

3659
03:51:13,300 --> 03:51:15,800
We can go kill- kill her again.

3660
03:51:22,460 --> 03:51:24,700
If I ever see that, I mean, we'll go now.

3661
03:51:26,380 --> 03:51:27,220
Yeah, we got everything.

3662
03:51:31,300 --> 03:51:33,040
Will I talk to the old man first?

3663
03:51:33,180 --> 03:51:33,400
Okay.

3664
03:51:35,320 --> 03:51:35,760
Eita!

3665
03:51:37,120 --> 03:51:40,420
Oh, wait, you guys told me to do the Shakira fight, right?

3666
03:51:41,540 --> 03:51:42,760
How do I do that?

3667
03:51:46,330 --> 03:51:47,890
Nah, I'm not gonna do the architect.

3668
03:51:48,050 --> 03:51:48,410
Press.

3669
03:51:52,660 --> 03:51:54,060
Bellheart, right side.

3670
03:51:54,500 --> 03:51:54,900
All right.

3671
03:51:55,760 --> 03:51:56,700
At Grimoire.

3672
03:51:58,220 --> 03:51:59,140
Why require...

3673
03:51:59,140 --> 03:52:00,920
Okay, which quest should I use?

3674
03:52:01,960 --> 03:52:02,080
Stop.

3675
03:52:05,980 --> 03:52:10,280
Here's been good to me, but the wonder apparently is the most OP, so we'll use the wonder.

3676
03:52:11,320 --> 03:52:18,420
Uh, we'll use poison, and then we can get rid of...

3677
03:52:19,420 --> 03:52:23,540

Oh my god, they're all dead!

3684
03:53:35,920 --> 03:53:38,160
The dragons, they're all dead.

3685
03:53:39,460 --> 03:53:40,100
Oh, shit.

3686
03:53:44,220 --> 03:53:46,520
Last, my last one.

3687
03:53:48,360 --> 03:53:49,200
I'm kidding.

3688
03:53:49,360 --> 03:53:50,500
It's like a little hard.

3689
03:53:52,900 --> 03:53:55,360
Holy shit, maybe I won't fight her.

3690
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:02,380
Okay, I think I need to use Silk's thread for...

3691
03:54:02,380 --> 03:54:04,180
Oh my god, I hate her.

3692
03:54:04,220 --> 03:54:05,840
Oh my god.

3693
03:54:08,540 --> 03:54:09,880
Oh my god.

3694
03:54:11,780 --> 03:54:12,380
Okay.

3695
03:54:13,520 --> 03:54:14,900
Oh my god, they're all gone again.

3696
03:54:19,540 --> 03:54:20,100
Christ.

3697

Nice.

3698
03:54:23,960 --> 03:54:25,560
Oh god.

3699
03:54:27,300 --> 03:54:28,600
Jesus Christ.

3700
03:54:28,880 --> 03:54:29,360
I hate these.

3701
03:54:30,540 --> 03:54:33,940
Oh my god.

3702
03:54:34,040 --> 03:54:35,440
I have to focus so hard.

3703
03:54:38,060 --> 03:54:38,860
No!

3704
03:54:40,720 --> 03:54:43,060
Oh my god, dude.

3705
03:54:43,460 --> 03:54:44,980
He did two hits.

3706
03:54:47,460 --> 03:54:49,640
He did two hits.

3707
03:54:50,060 --> 03:54:50,980
Get over here!

3708
03:54:51,160 --> 03:54:52,600

Okay.

3714
03:55:30,620 --> 03:55:33,500
I'm trying to concentrate so hard right now.

3715
03:55:36,460 --> 03:55:36,980
There we go.

3716
03:55:43,500 --> 03:55:44,260
Okay.

3717
03:55:47,820 --> 03:55:48,420
Good roll!

3718
03:55:49,160 --> 03:55:49,440
Oh!

3719
03:55:51,120 --> 03:55:51,980
Where did she go?

3720
03:55:52,900 --> 03:55:56,100
Sometimes I'm like, Where did she go?

3721
03:55:59,000 --> 03:56:01,580
No, you fucking kidding me.

3722
03:56:01,820 --> 03:56:15,040
Oh my god, that's so unlucky for me Oh my god No, wait, yes friend That's right.

3724
03:56:32,760 --> 03:56:33,320
That's it.

3725
03:56:33,840 --> 03:56:34,160
What?

3726
03:56:34,460 --> 03:56:35,280
That's it?

3727
03:56:36,540 --> 03:56:53,680
Poor strap Yeah That's it my reward is nothing My oh my god Another time I can't believe it all I my reward was nothing

3729
03:57:26,840 --> 03:57:29,080
I don't know if I can first try it again, honestly.

3730
03:57:29,660 --> 03:57:30,500
I was so lucky.

3731
03:57:31,140 --> 03:57:34,340
The last one we first tried, the final boss.

3732
03:57:34,880 --> 03:57:36,320
I was honestly very lucky.

3733
03:57:38,480 --> 03:57:39,980
Let's see this way.

3734
03:57:42,680 --> 03:57:45,320
And my reward was the friends I made all along.

3735
03:57:47,200 --> 03:57:47,880
Not fine.

3736
03:57:48,000 --> 03:57:48,740
We don't need shards.

3737
03:57:53,850 --> 03:57:54,690
That's fine.

3738
03:58:01,900 --> 03:58:02,480
Oh, here?

3739
03:58:03,660 --> 03:58:04,960
Sir, I have items requested.

3740
03:58:05,420 --> 03:58:07,400
Crafts me your trap that we may set lands free.

3741
03:58:08,200 --> 03:58:08,960
Alright, here you go.

3742
03:58:09,860 --> 03:58:11,500
I granted the wish.

3743
03:58:14,700 --> 03:58:16,700
Found it all, did you, Perringer?

3744
03:58:17,200 --> 03:58:19,860
Then join me and let the get- Let's get to prepping.

3745
03:58:20,280 --> 03:58:23,180
I'll be asking both your silk and your claws for the construction.

3746
03:58:32,040 --> 03:58:33,660
Alright, we go travel.

3747
03:58:34,600 --> 03:58:36,020
It's time the parts are prepared.

3748
03:58:36,360 --> 03:58:37,000
I'm heading now.

3749
03:58:37,340 --> 03:58:39,020
Now I'll just set the trap.

3750
03:58:39,380 --> 03:58:40,300
Even the trap blade?

3751
03:58:40,740 --> 03:58:43,160
Best be guessing, her on top won't go down so simple.

3752
03:58:43,300 --> 03:58:44,400
She'll sense what's coming.

3753
03:58:45,000 --> 03:58:48,480
That blade of yours is gonna have to do its work, for this thing can snap.

3754
03:58:48,800 --> 03:58:51,680
I expect it such, sir, and I'm ready.

3755
03:58:51,960 --> 03:58:52,680
Set your snare.

3756
03:58:52,900 --> 03:58:53,980
I shall tend shortly.

3757
03:58:54,620 --> 03:58:54,980
Alright.

3758
03:58:56,600 --> 03:58:57,480
It's time.

3759
03:59:00,840 --> 03:59:01,280
Alright.

3760
03:59:01,540 --> 03:59:02,320
Here we go.

3761
03:59:03,280 --> 03:59:04,020
One last round.

3762
03:59:04,120 --> 03:59:04,500
You know what?

3763
03:59:04,700 --> 03:59:06,280
Sing me one last song, Shermo.

3764
03:59:26,760 --> 03:59:39,740
oh all right that's all i get i guess um i have everything i need i feel like i don't I have, like, not a lot of yellow tools anyway, so it's fine.

3765
03:59:41,120 --> 03:59:41,380
Alright.

3766
03:59:44,100 --> 03:59:44,860
Oh, wait.

3767
03:59:45,100 --> 03:59:45,860
What am I doing?

3768
03:59:45,980 --> 03:59:48,200
I do not need some of these tools.

3769
03:59:49,900 --> 03:59:52,040
Oh, it doesn't matter, because I already...

3770
03:59:52,040 --> 03:59:53,480
Yeah, it doesn't fucking matter.

3771
03:59:54,960 --> 03:59:55,380
Actually.

3772
03:59:56,380 --> 03:59:56,800
Alright.

3773
03:59:57,040 --> 03:59:58,180
We have all the fleas.

3774
03:59:58,280 --> 03:59:59,540
Yeah, we collected all of them.

3775
03:59:59,860 --> 04:00:01,260
Okay, how do we get there again?

3776
04:00:01,380 --> 04:00:02,320
It's been so long.

3777
04:00:03,640 --> 04:00:04,940
Um, fuck, it's all...

3778
04:00:04,940 --> 04:00:05,720
Okay, oh, nice.

3779
04:00:05,780 --> 04:00:06,340
We have a tree.

3780
04:00:06,360 --> 04:00:07,060
Thank God.

3781
04:00:07,720 --> 04:00:08,300
Thank God.

3782
04:00:08,380 --> 04:00:10,820
I was like, oh my God, there's so much parkour.

3783
04:00:11,520 --> 04:00:12,080
But it's fine.

3784
04:00:12,200 --> 04:00:13,120
We have the terminus.

3785
04:00:23,720 --> 04:00:24,000
Alright.

3786
04:00:24,360 --> 04:00:25,800
We got to do this.

3787
04:00:27,600 --> 04:00:27,940
Yeah.

3788
04:00:31,000 --> 04:00:33,200
I don't know if I can do this first try.

3789
04:00:34,140 --> 04:00:35,020
Because like.

3790
04:00:35,740 --> 04:00:37,360
I just got really lucky.

3791
04:00:38,580 --> 04:00:39,540
So we'll see it.

3792
04:00:41,260 --> 04:00:42,020
I was very.

3793
04:00:42,220 --> 04:00:42,420
Oh yeah.

3794
04:00:42,440 --> 04:00:43,000
at the bench.

3795
04:00:43,180 --> 04:00:43,360
You're right.

3796
04:00:43,500 --> 04:00:43,900
I almost forgot.

3797
04:00:44,020 --> 04:00:44,640
Down I go.

3798
04:00:45,220 --> 04:00:46,080
It's like I never went.

3799
04:00:46,560 --> 04:00:48,440
It's like I never went back there.

3800
04:00:49,220 --> 04:00:50,620
Almost forgot at the bench.

3801
04:00:51,440 --> 04:00:52,320
Forgot existed.

3802
04:00:54,340 --> 04:00:56,460
Just like on the goddamn pipe.

3803
04:00:58,420 --> 04:00:59,740
Wait, do I have...

3804
04:00:59,740 --> 04:01:01,440
Does anyone actually geared up for it?

3805
04:01:01,500 --> 04:01:02,040
Yeah, I am.

3806
04:01:09,570 --> 04:01:10,010
Actually!

3807
04:01:11,610 --> 04:01:12,030
Okay.

3808
04:01:12,990 --> 04:01:14,590
I don't think I need poison.

3809
04:01:14,910 --> 04:01:16,010
I'm thinking about it.

3810
04:01:16,290 --> 04:01:50,030
Because I feel like I'll my silk thing more than the poison i was like wait i don't need the poison because like i feel like decrease would help decrease the cost i feel like silk skills oh wait no um put that here i feel like uh because like i don't they'll die so fast you know they'll die so fast i might as well another stuff Yeah,

3811
04:01:50,250 --> 04:01:50,930
I think that's better.

3812
04:01:51,710 --> 04:01:54,630
I just feel like they'll die too fast for me to use it.

3813
04:01:55,430 --> 04:01:56,950
I just have the cogs there for a bit.

3814
04:02:03,370 --> 04:02:04,590
Do I have Threadstorm on?

3815
04:02:04,870 --> 04:02:05,310
I'm pretty sure.

3816
04:02:05,410 --> 04:02:05,850
Yeah, I do.

3817
04:02:07,430 --> 04:02:08,530
I always use Threadstorm.

3818
04:02:11,470 --> 04:02:13,370
Alright, here we go.

3819
04:02:17,410 --> 04:02:20,800
See if...

3820
04:02:20,800 --> 04:02:21,400
What?

3821
04:02:25,020 --> 04:02:25,860
Oh my god.

3822
04:02:25,880 --> 04:02:26,480
God.

3823
04:02:27,380 --> 04:02:27,800
Wait.

3824
04:02:30,640 --> 04:02:32,280
I'm gonna say, how the fuck am I?

3825
04:02:36,620 --> 04:02:39,060
I'm gonna say, how the fuck am I supposed to get up here?

3826
04:02:40,620 --> 04:02:41,300
There we go.

3827
04:02:42,100 --> 04:02:44,300
Ah, you come a long way, bell-ringer.

3828
04:02:44,540 --> 04:02:47,980
Granting wishes, saving bugs, even rousing my soul and family to act.

3829
04:02:48,580 --> 04:02:51,040
The stairs that above are powered bound along its thread.

3830
04:02:51,460 --> 04:02:54,520
They decide it may seem a cruel thing, but there's fair strength to it.

3831
04:02:54,800 --> 04:02:56,220
Enough to dwell a god.

3832
04:02:57,020 --> 04:02:59,180
You and your The family have done me well.

3833
04:03:00,360 --> 04:03:02,920
I shall prove your faith in the meeting ahead.

3834
04:03:03,620 --> 04:03:06,440
I bring your best a bell ringer.

3835
04:03:06,680 --> 04:03:08,260
Call forth our great pal God.

3836
04:03:08,680 --> 04:03:11,580
Cut her weak, then drive the beast down atop the snare.

3837
04:03:12,680 --> 04:03:17,840
Contact made will stir the snare alive, but only your need of song will awaken the spell and fold.

3838
04:03:18,360 --> 04:03:20,580
When the moment arrives, you'll see it clear.

3839
04:03:21,400 --> 04:03:23,800
Okay, that seems pretty easy.

3840
04:03:24,880 --> 04:03:27,160
Honestly, doesn't seem too hard.

3841
04:03:27,920 --> 04:03:28,280
Alright.

3842
04:03:30,320 --> 04:03:32,500
We'll see if I can do this again.

3843
04:03:34,160 --> 04:03:34,280
Barama!

3844
04:03:36,140 --> 04:03:37,300
I don't remember how to fight her.

3845
04:03:38,280 --> 04:03:40,740
Like, at first, I literally, I first tried her.

3846
04:03:41,080 --> 04:03:43,020
I legitimately don't even remember how I killed her.

3847
04:03:52,520 --> 04:03:53,900
Okay, I'll try it.

3848
04:03:54,000 --> 04:03:54,640
I'm gonna...

3849
04:03:56,300 --> 04:04:00,140
Yeah, I know she's easy, but I legitimately don't remember how I killed her.

3850
04:04:00,320 --> 04:04:00,760
Whoops.

3851
04:04:01,320 --> 04:04:02,760
Oh, I forgot to set up.

3852
04:04:07,970 --> 04:04:08,910
Fuck it.

3853
04:04:12,590 --> 04:04:14,070
Oh shit, I didn't see that.

3854
04:04:14,210 --> 04:04:14,950
That's my bad.

3855
04:04:15,450 --> 04:04:16,370
Oh, fuck it.

3856
04:04:16,750 --> 04:04:17,230
Friend.

3857
04:04:18,610 --> 04:04:18,790
Friend.

3858
04:04:22,310 --> 04:04:22,790
Friend.

3859
04:04:26,190 --> 04:04:27,090
No, just fuck it.

3860
04:04:28,170 --> 04:04:29,030
Oh, nice, lucky.

3861
04:04:30,510 --> 04:04:31,030
There we go.

3862
04:04:31,830 --> 04:04:34,870
There we go.

3863
04:04:35,050 --> 04:04:37,110
There we go.

3864
04:04:38,690 --> 04:04:39,490
Oh shit!

3865
04:04:39,770 --> 04:04:40,710
I forgot about the rocks.

3866
04:04:40,710 --> 04:04:42,550
Don't get- Don't die to the rocks, Dragos!

3867
04:04:42,670 --> 04:04:43,850
Don't worry, I'll protect you!

3868
04:04:45,710 --> 04:04:46,770
Don't die to the rocks!

3869
04:04:46,830 --> 04:04:48,410
You'll be very stupid if you do!

3870
04:04:51,530 --> 04:04:52,510
Come on, guys!

3871
04:04:55,250 --> 04:04:56,530
Oh my god, fuck!

3872
04:04:57,750 --> 04:04:59,710
I lost track of where I was.

3873
04:05:00,130 --> 04:05:01,370
I got lost.

3874
04:05:02,270 --> 04:05:04,050
Oh my god, it's not okay.

3875
04:05:06,850 --> 04:05:07,330
Okay.

3876
04:05:07,330 --> 04:05:16,690
I don't know how I got lost like there's not a lot of stuff to look at to be fair lucky row let's go

3878
04:05:50,990 --> 04:05:53,490
With the power of music

3879
04:06:03,300 --> 04:06:16,180
Oh my god, I told you she's alive The silk transfusion worked Thank god I'm a universal silk donor Oh my gosh, she's alive Oh, is that the void?

3880
04:06:16,600 --> 04:06:17,560
Wait, what the fuck?

3881
04:06:22,940 --> 04:06:24,020
alive

3882
04:06:27,210 --> 04:06:29,790

3883
04:06:33,110 --> 04:06:36,790
yay the void oh

3884
04:06:53,400 --> 04:07:06,840
oh the void is imbued into the silk that doesn't sound good oh that looks very bad i didn't kill everyone.

3885
04:07:07,300 --> 04:07:09,140
Okay, maybe me being queen was a lot better.

3886
04:07:09,480 --> 04:07:10,020
Why the fuck?

3887
04:07:10,120 --> 04:07:13,380
How is Act 3 the better ending when I could rule the entire Farlume?

3888
04:07:16,580 --> 04:07:18,100
Now I'm doomed Farlume!

3889
04:07:18,260 --> 04:07:18,420
What?

3890
04:07:18,560 --> 04:07:19,740
Okay, that's what I'm saying.

3891
04:07:20,000 --> 04:07:22,340
Me being queen was definitely the better ending.

3892
04:07:28,040 --> 04:07:28,480
Yay!

3893
04:07:28,940 --> 04:07:30,660
I destroyed the world.

3894
04:07:31,640 --> 04:07:32,080
Yippee!

3895
04:07:34,940 --> 04:07:36,140
Aren't I friends with a boy?

3896
04:07:36,160 --> 04:07:38,760
wouldn't I want everyone to get voided?

3897
04:07:39,480 --> 04:07:39,800
You know?

3898
04:07:40,700 --> 04:07:41,960
I thought I'm friends with a void.

3899
04:07:44,720 --> 04:07:46,460
I'm June Farlume again.

3900
04:07:48,720 --> 04:07:49,680
First time.

3901
04:07:53,020 --> 04:07:55,920
I'm not friends with a void, but I'm friends with Hollow Knight.

3902
04:08:00,830 --> 04:08:03,970
I'm friends with John Hollow Knight and his younger brother.

3903
04:08:04,630 --> 04:08:05,290
Hollow Knight Jr.

3904
04:08:09,390 --> 04:08:12,130
But he's like my little He's my half-brother.

3905
04:08:13,070 --> 04:08:14,590
My several half-brothers.

3906
04:08:24,790 --> 04:08:25,810
Yeah, I'm like her cool.

3907
04:08:25,910 --> 04:08:27,530
I'm like the cool older sister.

3908
04:08:32,200 --> 04:08:33,460
The void is just void.

3909
04:08:33,640 --> 04:08:34,580
He doesn't care.

3910
04:08:35,400 --> 04:08:35,680
All right.

3911
04:08:36,200 --> 04:08:37,340
Act three done.

3912
04:08:37,700 --> 04:08:39,980
I definitely did not achieve the speed running.

3913
04:08:40,680 --> 04:08:41,840
The speed run.

3914
04:08:48,580 --> 04:08:49,160
All right.

3915
04:08:49,500 --> 04:08:49,860
Let's do it.

3916
04:08:49,940 --> 04:08:50,120
Let's.

3917
04:08:50,300 --> 04:08:51,140
Oh my god.

3918
04:08:51,320 --> 04:08:52,100
What the fuck?

3919
04:08:55,300 --> 04:08:56,420
What the fuck is going?

3920
04:08:56,940 --> 04:08:57,260
Oh, wait.

3921
04:08:57,280 --> 04:08:57,980
Act 2 done.

3922
04:08:58,200 --> 04:08:58,200
Sorry.

3923
04:08:58,540 --> 04:08:58,840
Act 2.

3924
04:08:59,020 --> 04:08:59,860
Act 3 started.

3925
04:09:00,660 --> 04:09:01,300
Oh, shit.

3926
04:09:01,760 --> 04:09:02,940
Be gone, Void.

3927
04:09:03,240 --> 04:09:03,980
Be gone.

3928
04:09:06,920 --> 04:09:08,380
Yeah, I first tried it again.

3929
04:09:08,680 --> 04:09:10,060
Technically, second first try.

3930
04:09:26,040 --> 04:09:26,380
Huh?

3931
04:09:28,200 --> 04:09:29,540
Oh, yeah, it's a cradle.

3932
04:09:31,880 --> 04:09:33,480
Catgirls, welcome to the tomato farm.

3933
04:09:33,700 --> 04:09:34,260
Welcome, welcome.

3934
04:09:49,980 --> 04:09:51,720
Alright, it's the abish.

3935
04:09:52,940 --> 04:09:53,720
The abish.

3936
04:09:58,310 --> 04:10:31,980

I'm so sad.

3938
04:10:35,280 --> 04:10:38,440
They're not accepting any orders right now.

3939
04:10:43,060 --> 04:10:44,980
They're currently not available.

3940
04:10:45,920 --> 04:10:47,520
I'm so sad.

3941
04:10:48,100 --> 04:10:49,640
Why would you not?

3942
04:10:51,160 --> 04:10:53,900
They're not just remembering Jolly.

3943
04:10:54,220 --> 04:10:56,440
They're like currently not accepting any orders, right?

3944
04:10:59,680 --> 04:11:29,120
in jolly bees i really was craving some jolly bees i'm so sad i'm so sad why do you mean you're not accepting orders uh why is the world so cruel i killed i did so much i killed i killed a mom I'm a child.

3945
04:11:29,460 --> 04:11:31,300
I deserve Jolly Feast.

3946
04:11:33,200 --> 04:11:35,500
I did so much.

3947
04:11:36,040 --> 04:11:40,360
That should be like, that should be my reward.

3948
04:11:41,680 --> 04:11:43,700
I killed a mom and a child.

3949
04:11:43,940 --> 04:11:46,200
I should be rewarded for my actions.

3950
04:11:50,700 --> 04:11:51,420
True.

3951
04:11:51,420 --> 04:11:53,180
I'm so sad.

3952
04:11:53,440 --> 04:11:55,860
Why is the world so cruel to me?

3953
04:11:56,620 --> 04:12:25,400
I think that's the opposite i should be allowed go to check up no thanks wait the store is not accepting another i don't care accept my order i don't care i demand you to accept my order i demand it no jolly i just really i just really want jolly bees

3954
04:12:30,600 --> 04:12:33,140
Barloom needs to open a Jolly V.

3955
04:12:33,300 --> 04:12:34,240
That's so true.

3956
04:12:34,340 --> 04:12:35,180
You're so right.

3957
04:12:35,500 --> 04:12:39,220
Okay, maybe it'll accept my order in two more minutes.

3958
04:12:39,620 --> 04:12:45,900
How can it be too many people ordering Jolly V at this specific time?

3959
04:12:46,440 --> 04:12:47,600
I don't understand.

3960
04:12:47,760 --> 04:12:50,460
There's still an hour left before you close.

3961
04:12:50,800 --> 04:12:52,540
You can't do this to me.

3962
04:12:53,280 --> 04:12:55,980
Sorry, JK, there's 30 minutes before they close.

3963
04:12:58,300 --> 04:13:25,060
plenty of time just take my buddy i'm so hungry i was craving jolly bees the entire day but i was like no just wait don't get you can wait just a little longer just wait a little bit a few kids you can wait a little bit before you order

3964
04:13:28,300 --> 04:13:31,680
Restaurants aren't taking any order anymore.

3965
04:13:32,820 --> 04:13:34,140
Life is so cruel.

3966
04:13:35,580 --> 04:13:37,220
It's so cruel.

3967
04:13:37,760 --> 04:13:41,580
They're not accepting any orders right now.

3968
04:13:41,740 --> 04:13:42,860
I don't understand.

3969
04:13:42,880 --> 04:13:44,860
I've been a good person.

3970
04:13:45,740 --> 04:13:48,960
I killed the family for the greater good.

3971
04:13:49,240 --> 04:13:52,600
And then I doomed the entire village for the greater good.

3972
04:13:52,980 --> 04:13:56,160
And I let the void out for the greater good.

3973
04:14:00,000 --> 04:14:04,020
It was all for the great and good.

3974
04:14:07,620 --> 04:14:10,180
I did it for you.

3975
04:14:12,300 --> 04:14:14,260
I did it for you.

3976
04:14:14,860 --> 04:14:17,660
Are you social boy in my house?

3977
04:14:18,000 --> 04:14:19,040
Why me cranky?

3978
04:14:19,120 --> 04:14:19,860
Why me home?

3979
04:14:21,500 --> 04:14:22,580
Oh my god.

3980
04:14:22,880 --> 04:14:23,960
I'm so sad.

3981
04:14:24,380 --> 04:14:26,540
I don't know what I did to deserve this.

3982
04:14:27,040 --> 04:14:28,280
Maybe they're open now.

3983
04:14:28,300 --> 04:14:33,520
Maybe if I click refresh, the jolly bee is open again.

3984
04:14:34,140 --> 04:14:34,700
Come on.

3985
04:14:35,240 --> 04:14:36,040
Do something.

3986
04:14:36,240 --> 04:14:37,880
How can you be busy?

3987
04:14:39,100 --> 04:14:42,020
Do you know who I am?

3988
04:14:44,940 --> 04:14:48,910
How could you do this to me?

3989
04:14:53,080 --> 04:14:54,020
Angry.

3990
04:14:56,160 --> 04:14:56,380
Angry.

3991
04:14:58,540 --> 04:14:59,820
Angry bug.

3992
04:15:09,480 --> 04:15:11,140
I'm angry now.

3993
04:15:14,240 --> 04:15:15,780
I'm angry bird.

3994
04:15:16,500 --> 04:15:17,520
Where the fuck am I?

3995
04:15:17,540 --> 04:15:18,740
Do I just lose my compass?

3996
04:15:19,020 --> 04:15:20,740
Like what happened to my compass?

3997
04:15:23,080 --> 04:15:24,580
Wait, I'm so lost.

3998
04:15:28,300 --> 04:15:29,460
What happened to my compass?

3999
04:15:29,680 --> 04:15:30,960
They took my compass away.

4000
04:15:31,800 --> 04:15:32,920
Oh, there it is.

4001
04:15:32,980 --> 04:15:34,140
They could just do that.

4002
04:15:35,440 --> 04:15:37,500
They could just take my compass away.

4003
04:15:38,360 --> 04:15:39,220
That's fucked.

4004
04:15:40,740 --> 04:15:41,100
Oh, no.

4005
04:15:41,200 --> 04:15:42,300
My weak ass legs.

4006
04:15:42,900 --> 04:15:44,300
I never do leg game.

4007
04:15:46,640 --> 04:15:47,900
How did they unquip everything?

4008
04:15:47,980 --> 04:15:49,140
Did they, like, strip me?

4009
04:15:49,300 --> 04:15:50,640
Like, who stripped me?

4010
04:15:51,600 --> 04:15:52,680
Down I go.

4011
04:15:55,300 --> 04:15:56,000
Am I okay?

4012
04:15:56,420 --> 04:15:57,120
Oh, okay.

4013
04:15:57,200 --> 04:15:57,680
That's cool.

4014
04:15:57,760 --> 04:16:01,240
I was like, And like credits end, like, oh, she's dead now.

4015
04:16:01,840 --> 04:16:03,700
Oh my god, my weak ass nigs.

4016
04:16:04,320 --> 04:16:04,660
Please.

4017
04:16:06,800 --> 04:16:10,620
My weak ass, skinny ass nigs can't hold my body up.

4018
04:16:14,240 --> 04:16:16,140
Like, did the boy take my stuff?

4019
04:16:16,700 --> 04:16:18,400
Like, who took my stuff?

4020
04:16:20,060 --> 04:16:21,720
I don't understand.

4021
04:16:22,000 --> 04:16:26,180
What could I possibly have taken my things?

4022
04:16:30,560 --> 04:16:34,280
Oh, here these guys are all dead, dead.

4023
04:16:36,100 --> 04:16:37,280
Well, there's the boy.

4024
04:16:40,220 --> 04:16:41,600
Oh, wait, there's something over here.

4025
04:16:45,640 --> 04:16:46,980
Oh, whoops.

4026
04:16:47,540 --> 04:16:48,300
Oh, that sucks.

4027
04:16:49,300 --> 04:16:50,620
I have a lot of HP either.

4028
04:16:51,140 --> 04:16:52,660
Oh, are you serious?

4029
04:16:53,020 --> 04:16:54,940
Okay, they baited me.

4030
04:16:55,600 --> 04:16:57,380
Jolly Beast took my compass.

4031
04:16:57,580 --> 04:16:57,800
Damn.

4032
04:16:58,840 --> 04:17:00,060
At least I got full HP.

4033
04:17:00,240 --> 04:17:00,600
back.

4034
04:17:01,060 --> 04:17:01,440
Thank God.

4035
04:17:04,180 --> 04:17:05,140
That was cheap.

4036
04:17:05,820 --> 04:17:07,100
That was actually so cheap.

4037
04:17:17,860 --> 04:17:18,760
They're here?

4038
04:17:19,040 --> 04:17:20,660
Oh my god, I don't even know if it was here.

4039
04:17:21,400 --> 04:17:22,920
They took my...

4040
04:17:22,920 --> 04:17:23,920
They took everything.

4041
04:17:25,300 --> 04:17:26,480
It was here.

4042
04:17:27,180 --> 04:17:29,360
Are you fucking kidding me?

4043
04:17:35,440 --> 04:17:36,720
Here you are.

4044
04:17:36,740 --> 04:17:38,840
Where is it?

4045
04:17:40,400 --> 04:17:42,660
Wait, where did my thing go?

4046
04:17:46,730 --> 04:17:48,130
Wait, what?

4047
04:17:50,870 --> 04:17:52,290
Where is it?

4048
04:17:53,430 --> 04:17:55,410
Where is my cocoon?

4049
04:18:03,980 --> 04:18:05,260
Oh my god.

4050
04:18:05,960 --> 04:18:06,560
Fuck it.

4051
04:18:07,780 --> 04:18:09,140
I don't care.

4052
04:18:10,020 --> 04:18:10,840
I don't care.

4053
04:18:10,920 --> 04:18:12,420
I just don't know where it is.

4054
04:18:17,200 --> 04:18:26,100
when oh no it's that boy they're so strong now jesus christ oh my god they're so strong

04:18:52,410 --> 04:18:54,630
Oh my god, that means he does poor damage, doesn't he?

4059
04:18:55,970 --> 04:18:56,850
Oh my god.

4060
04:18:57,610 --> 04:18:59,270
This guy does poor damage, doesn't he?

4061
04:19:00,830 --> 04:19:01,790
Jesus Christ.

4062
04:19:02,730 --> 04:19:03,470
That's not fair.

4063
04:19:04,670 --> 04:19:07,710
When I get Embed with a boy, I still do one damage.

4064
04:19:10,890 --> 04:19:12,070
I'm so sad.

4065
04:19:12,390 --> 04:19:13,410
Maybe, wait, what's...

4066
04:19:13,510 --> 04:19:16,210
Maybe Jolly... Wait, I'm gonna check again, guys.

4067
04:19:16,550 --> 04:19:19,170
I'm gonna check again.

4068
04:19:20,550 --> 04:19:22,530
Are they accepting orders now?

4069
04:19:23,170 --> 04:19:23,830
Jolly B?

4070
04:19:24,590 --> 04:19:25,610
Jolly B.

4071
04:19:26,870 --> 04:19:28,390
Jolly B.

4072
04:19:31,830 --> 04:19:33,870
Maybe it would change.

4073
04:19:34,650 --> 04:19:36,370
You don't know that.

4074
04:19:36,850 --> 04:19:40,070
Maybe it'll be different if I keep refreshing.

4075
04:19:41,410 --> 04:19:43,350
I mean, these guys aren't avoided.

4076
04:19:43,510 --> 04:20:00,670

jesus christ poor girl only jolly bee can feel that boy the mask stays on I'm so hungry.

4078
04:20:19,760 --> 04:20:21,560
That's why I'm so weak right now.

4079
04:20:24,580 --> 04:20:25,180
And then quit.

4080
04:20:25,360 --> 04:20:26,000
And then I...

4081
04:20:26,000 --> 04:20:28,260
And that's how Act 3 wins, guys.

4082
04:20:28,620 --> 04:20:29,920
This is how Act 3 ends.

4083
04:20:31,380 --> 04:20:31,500
Oh!

4084
04:20:34,300 --> 04:20:37,520
Oh my god, what happened to you, Sherma?

4085
04:20:38,580 --> 04:20:40,600
Why do you look like that?

4086
04:20:42,180 --> 04:20:43,940
What happened to your cute hat?

4087
04:20:44,480 --> 04:20:45,780
Boy, Red maiden.

4088
04:20:48,240 --> 04:20:48,800
wait.

4089
04:20:50,300 --> 04:20:51,300
Mila Sherma?

4090
04:20:51,540 --> 04:20:52,760
Yeah, what has happened here?

4091
04:20:53,400 --> 04:20:54,500
To our safe haven?

4092
04:20:55,240 --> 04:20:55,800
By home?

4093
04:20:56,600 --> 04:21:00,620
This is what's left of it after the great breaking began.

4094
04:21:01,360 --> 04:21:03,040
There was that terrible noise from above.

4095
04:21:03,660 --> 04:21:05,820
Everything shook and fell apart.

4096
04:21:06,220 --> 04:21:08,380
And the black thread sprung out from beneath.

4097
04:21:08,940 --> 04:21:11,920
Many a poor pilgrim has already been lost to destruction.

4098
04:21:12,780 --> 04:21:13,800
You might have been too.

4099
04:21:13,920 --> 04:21:15,840
I have an offer some fleeing pilgrims who found

4100
04:21:18,960 --> 04:21:50,480
the black threads I may understand their source I must speak with the old caretaker do you know what has become of him as he has left you his garb oh wait he's she's wearing his shit oh yes he charged me with oh you got promotion oh and with no like increase of pay just the status nice it's like she got promoted to assistant regional manager assistant regional manager of the Assistant of the Assistant Regional Manager.

4101
04:21:51,460 --> 04:21:53,600
He charged me with looking after those remaining here.

4102
04:21:54,000 --> 04:21:56,620
Said he had to confer with his family down below.

4103
04:21:56,660 --> 04:21:58,300
Down below.

4104
04:21:58,800 --> 04:22:01,220
And they slunked away to hide in their ruined chapel.

4105
04:22:01,760 --> 04:22:02,780
I must pay them a visit.

4106
04:22:03,080 --> 04:22:03,820
Thank you, Sherma.

4107
04:22:04,220 --> 04:22:06,740
Stay safe and take care of your fellow pilgrims.

4108
04:22:09,960 --> 04:22:11,360
Oh, what's that screaming?

4109
04:22:11,900 --> 04:22:15,340
Times like this, we must be sure to help each other dig deep, dear one.

4110
04:22:15,700 --> 04:22:18,220
I'll be leaving a lot of roads to survive what's coming.

4111
04:22:18,240 --> 04:22:20,240
Okay, you have nothing for me.

4112
04:22:20,620 --> 04:22:20,800
Watch out.

4113
04:22:20,900 --> 04:22:22,100
They give a super chat that you think.

4114
04:22:22,360 --> 04:22:24,940
I'm hanging out with some dragons and we're going to get Jolly Bee.

4115
04:22:25,080 --> 04:22:27,060
The spaghetti is so good.

4116
04:22:29,400 --> 04:22:31,180
Maybe it's so open.

4117
04:22:31,480 --> 04:22:33,920
Maybe they're except I'm refreshing again.

4118
04:22:34,600 --> 04:22:36,660
Maybe it's open now.

4119
04:22:42,720 --> 04:22:45,900
I just want Jolly Bee's.

4120
04:22:47,420 --> 04:22:51,800
So like, What the fuck happened to my- Oh my god, they stripped me, the boy!

4121
04:22:52,800 --> 04:22:54,760
The boy, they took everything.

4122
04:22:55,260 --> 04:22:56,240
That's crazy.

4123
04:22:56,480 --> 04:22:57,520
That's fucked up.

4124
04:22:57,880 --> 04:23:00,140
Bro, that's like, I gotta report to HR.

4125
04:23:00,400 --> 04:23:01,380
What the fuck?

4126
04:23:01,940 --> 04:23:06,860
How does the boy took all my clothes and my freaky ass boy?

4127
04:23:09,380 --> 04:23:11,920
Yeah, freaking freaky ass boy.

4128
04:23:12,940 --> 04:23:15,760
Um, I don't think we need the poison.

4129
04:23:16,420 --> 04:23:17,660
Like, it's not that much.

4130
04:23:18,240 --> 04:23:19,620
That's messed up.

4131
04:23:20,720 --> 04:23:22,860
Oh my god, they took everything from me.

4132
04:23:23,500 --> 04:23:25,320
Alright, let's go pay the Liza visit.

4133
04:23:25,940 --> 04:23:28,180
Alright, let's get our nail upgrade and we'll call it here.

4134
04:23:28,680 --> 04:23:29,340
If we can.

4135
04:23:30,700 --> 04:23:32,120
Let's see if we can.

4136
04:23:33,160 --> 04:23:35,280
Well, the Jolly Beat is still open here.

4137
04:23:35,500 --> 04:23:37,180
Zero, thank you for the saving.

4138
04:23:37,420 --> 04:23:38,760
I'm so sad.

4139
04:23:39,540 --> 04:23:40,500
I was crawling.

4140
04:23:40,960 --> 04:23:44,060
My stomach is like gurgle, gurgle, gurgle.

4141
04:23:44,300 --> 04:23:45,940
And I'm like, I can't wait.

4142
04:23:46,020 --> 04:23:47,040
Wait, where's my elevator?

4143
04:23:48,620 --> 04:23:49,700
What the fuck?

4144
04:23:50,260 --> 04:23:51,300
He took my elevator.

4145
04:23:51,460 --> 04:23:53,900
He took my jolly bees and my elevator?

4146
04:23:55,000 --> 04:23:57,600
Oh my god, what else do you want to take from me?

4147
04:23:57,980 --> 04:23:58,160
What?

4148
04:23:58,900 --> 04:23:59,900
Are you serious?

4149
04:24:00,820 --> 04:24:02,180
Where the fuck am I going to...

4150
04:24:02,180 --> 04:24:05,440
Oh my god, they go all the way here, down here.

4151
04:24:05,520 --> 04:24:06,320
That's evil.

4152
04:24:06,660 --> 04:24:08,920
That's actually so fucking evil.

4153
04:24:09,160 --> 04:24:11,180
Like, he also took my elevator.

4154
04:24:12,320 --> 04:24:13,300
Oh my god.

4155
04:24:14,520 --> 04:24:16,040
Oh my god.

4156
04:24:16,180 --> 04:24:17,460
It took me years to travel.

4157
04:24:18,420 --> 04:24:18,980
anything.

4158
04:24:23,550 --> 04:24:24,110
What's that?

4159
04:24:27,150 --> 04:24:29,130
Where is that coming from?

4160
04:24:33,090 --> 04:24:34,370
What the fuck?

4161
04:24:41,220 --> 04:24:42,200
What is that?

4162
04:24:42,240 --> 04:24:43,700
How do I... Oh, it's below?

4163
04:24:46,040 --> 04:24:46,800
What the fuck?

4164
04:24:47,420 --> 04:24:48,760
Oh, it's right here.

4165
04:24:50,660 --> 04:24:51,860
What the fuck is singing?

4166
04:24:57,140 --> 04:24:58,200
I'm so sad.

4167
04:25:02,480 --> 04:25:04,020
He has a majestic...

4168
04:25:04,020 --> 04:25:04,920
That's not Trovia.

4169
04:25:05,720 --> 04:25:07,540
I refuse to believe that was...

4170
04:25:07,540 --> 04:25:08,060
That's Trovia.

4171
04:25:08,860 --> 04:25:09,280
Trovia!

4172
04:25:11,140 --> 04:25:11,900
Trovia!

4173
04:25:13,320 --> 04:25:13,740
What?

4174
04:25:14,100 --> 04:25:15,220
What the fuck happened?

4175
04:25:15,740 --> 04:25:16,020
What?

4176
04:25:16,500 --> 04:25:17,740
What the fuck happened?

4177
04:25:18,120 --> 04:25:19,840
What happened to it?

4178
04:25:19,980 --> 04:25:20,560
The boy.

4179
04:25:21,080 --> 04:25:21,720
The boy.

4180
04:25:22,000 --> 04:25:22,820
They got it.

4181
04:25:23,280 --> 04:25:24,660
Jesus Christ!

4182
04:25:25,140 --> 04:25:26,300
I'm leaving.

4183
04:25:27,200 --> 04:25:28,400
I'm not that desperate.

4184
04:25:29,860 --> 04:25:31,040
Bro got voided.

4185
04:25:31,300 --> 04:25:31,480
Yeah.

4186
04:25:31,880 --> 04:25:33,440
I was like, what the fuck happened to her?

4187
04:25:36,660 --> 04:25:37,280
All right.

4188
04:25:41,990 --> 04:25:43,590
No, I'm not going in there.

4189
04:25:44,890 --> 04:25:45,890
Oh, there's the void.

4190
04:25:47,590 --> 04:25:49,470
More HP and more damage.

4191
04:25:49,650 --> 04:25:50,350
See, this is...

4192
04:25:50,350 --> 04:25:51,090
Oh my god!

4193
04:25:51,230 --> 04:25:52,210
Okay, she's not voided.

4194
04:25:52,830 --> 04:25:53,470
That's good.

4195
04:25:54,210 --> 04:25:54,810
That's good.

4196
04:25:54,890 --> 04:25:55,910
These guys are not voided.

4197
04:25:56,870 --> 04:25:58,190
Oh my god, they're coming.

4198
04:26:01,010 --> 04:26:01,490

Okay, that's okay.

4203

He's actually shooting shit.

4204
04:27:14,770 --> 04:27:15,330
Alright.

4205
04:27:16,690 --> 04:27:17,910
Let's try this again.

4206
04:27:20,230 --> 04:27:22,230
I was like, what the fuck was that?

4207
04:27:22,670 --> 04:27:23,670
That's his asshole.

4208
04:27:24,090 --> 04:27:27,310
I'm like, I'm like sticking my needle into his ass.

4209
04:27:29,090 --> 04:27:30,430
I don't know.

4210
04:27:30,990 --> 04:27:32,910
I don't know how to react to that.

4211
04:27:33,070 --> 04:27:35,490
Honestly, I don't know.

4212
04:27:35,850 --> 04:27:39,110
I don't know how I'm supposed to react to it.

4213
04:27:40,010 --> 04:27:43,030
I guess I'll just keep hitting his ass, I guess.

4214
04:27:45,770 --> 04:27:46,430
Alright.

4215
04:27:49,770 --> 04:27:51,890
That feels like the only thing I can do.

4216
04:27:52,710 --> 04:27:53,070
Honestly.

4217
04:27:58,580 --> 04:27:58,940
Alright.

4218
04:28:02,500 --> 04:28:03,820
Jesus Christo.

4219
04:28:07,480 --> 04:28:09,620
Oh my god, that's so annoying.

4220
04:28:10,180 --> 04:28:11,260
That's so annoying.

4221
04:28:13,860 --> 04:28:17,580
Because it's that, what the fuck do I do with these explosion berries?

4222
04:28:22,050 --> 04:28:24,250
Like, what the fuck do I do?

4223
04:28:27,930 --> 04:28:28,510
No.

4224
04:28:29,250 --> 04:28:31,510
Oh my god, this is not fair.

4225
04:28:32,330 --> 04:28:33,390
It's not fair.

4226
04:28:35,530 --> 04:28:37,250
Like, what do I do?

4227
04:28:39,430 --> 04:28:41,170
What do I do?

4228
04:28:42,130 --> 04:28:45,050
I don't know what to do in that situation.

4229
04:28:47,230 --> 04:28:48,330
Just don't get hit.

4230
04:28:48,650 --> 04:28:49,910
It's just that easy.

4231
04:28:52,790 --> 04:28:55,510
Alright, all my dragons died in the war.

4232
04:28:56,010 --> 04:29:00,630
So, um, we're just gonna raw it, I guess.

4233
04:29:03,850 --> 04:29:04,490
Okay.

4234
04:29:05,590 --> 04:29:07,750
It's very unfortunate they all died.

4235
04:29:09,650 --> 04:29:11,430
Oh my god.

4236
04:29:21,630 --> 04:29:22,430
Shit.

4237
04:29:25,490 --> 04:29:26,590
Oh god.

4238
04:29:26,910 --> 04:29:27,110
Oh god.

4239
04:29:28,330 --> 04:29:29,070
Oh god.

4240
04:29:29,870 --> 04:29:30,250
Oh god.

4241
04:29:31,510 --> 04:29:32,330
Oh my god.

4242
04:29:32,470 --> 04:29:33,810
Thank god.

4243
04:29:34,070 --> 04:29:34,690
Oh thank god.

4244
04:29:35,470 --> 04:29:39,640
Are you serious?

4245
04:29:41,520 --> 04:29:42,320
This is so scary.

4246
04:29:43,860 --> 04:29:43,860
Oh!

4247
04:29:44,360 --> 04:29:44,360
Sight!

4248
04:29:45,280 --> 04:29:46,760
Sight to me!

4249
04:29:48,760 --> 04:29:49,560
Fuck.

4250
04:29:50,880 --> 04:29:51,180
this.

4251
04:29:51,520 --> 04:29:52,300
Okay, I got it.

4252
04:29:52,540 --> 04:29:53,560
I'm gonna use my shards.

4253
04:29:54,580 --> 04:29:56,300
Okay, this guy sucks, though.

4254
04:29:56,440 --> 04:29:58,060
This guy fucking sucks.

4255
04:29:59,080 --> 04:29:59,500
Alright.

4256
04:30:01,560 --> 04:30:02,160
Here you go.

4257
04:30:02,340 --> 04:30:03,700
Back to the war you come.

4258
04:30:03,820 --> 04:30:04,900
You're coming with me to war.

4259
04:30:05,920 --> 04:30:09,840
Oh my god, I swear to god, if you guys don't come down here, I swear to god.

4260
04:30:10,960 --> 04:30:12,000
Oh, thank god.

4261
04:30:12,280 --> 04:30:13,360
Yeah, I was like, where are you?

4262
04:30:16,440 --> 04:30:19,720
I was gonna be like, I swear to god, where did you guys go?

4263
04:30:27,650 --> 04:30:28,250
That's it.

4264
04:30:28,670 --> 04:30:29,610
It's Tohotap.

4265
04:30:30,610 --> 04:30:31,470
Are you serious?

4266
04:30:32,310 --> 04:30:33,810
Are you actually serious?

4267
04:30:35,470 --> 04:30:37,410
He was, in fact, very serious.

4268
04:30:42,620 --> 04:30:42,860
Okay.

4269
04:30:44,800 --> 04:30:46,840
You're all still alive, at least.

4270
04:30:48,300 --> 04:30:49,520
Okay, I'll dodge this.

4271
04:30:50,840 --> 04:30:52,040
I tried.

4272
04:30:52,520 --> 04:30:54,460
I did try to dodge it.

4273
04:30:56,760 --> 04:31:06,340
I didn't dodge that Okay, I didn't dodge that I ran into him Okay, not that though I admit that was not a dodge

4274
04:31:13,930 --> 04:31:24,530
Okay Dragoons, I'll give you one more try Before I banish you I'll give you one more Chance to redeem yourself

4275
04:31:29,640 --> 04:31:31,580
You're still Stupid asshole.

4276
04:31:35,640 --> 04:31:36,040
What?

4277
04:31:37,090 --> 04:31:38,060
He did it first?

4278
04:31:38,180 --> 04:31:38,420
What?

4279
04:31:38,620 --> 04:31:39,040
The fuck?

4280
04:31:39,200 --> 04:31:40,020
He did this first?

4281
04:31:41,000 --> 04:31:41,700
Okay.

4282
04:31:42,720 --> 04:31:43,260
That's fine.

4283
04:31:44,140 --> 04:31:45,260
That's fine.

4284
04:31:47,300 --> 04:31:50,500
I feel like I can really only hit him once there.

4285
04:31:52,920 --> 04:31:54,280
Are you serious?

4286
04:31:55,740 --> 04:31:56,160
Friend.

4287
04:31:59,610 --> 04:32:01,270
Oh my god, that's three.

4288
04:32:04,950 --> 04:32:05,430
Okay.

4289
04:32:08,570 --> 04:32:10,610
I did not expect that, but that's fine.

4290
04:32:13,270 --> 04:32:15,430
Okay, I can do two hits there.

4291
04:32:17,630 --> 04:32:18,470
Oh my god, fuck.

4292
04:32:18,870 --> 04:32:19,650
That was...

4293
04:32:19,650 --> 04:32:20,530
Are you serious?

4294
04:32:23,910 --> 04:32:25,190
I got so scared.

4295
04:32:27,030 --> 04:32:27,870
Oh, no.

4296
04:32:28,930 --> 04:32:30,450
Oh, no, I'm scared for this one.

4297
04:32:35,430 --> 04:32:36,210
Here you go.

4298
04:32:36,430 --> 04:32:37,250
Oh, nice.

4299
04:32:40,070 --> 04:32:40,630
Wait!

4300
04:32:44,790 --> 04:32:44,970
Wait!

4301
04:32:44,970 --> 04:32:46,230
Okay, I can stay here for now.

4302
04:32:50,220 --> 04:32:50,480
Ah!

4303
04:32:50,740 --> 04:32:51,040
No!

4304
04:32:51,320 --> 04:32:51,680
No!

4305
04:32:55,890 --> 04:32:57,130
Jesus Christ!

4306
04:32:57,970 --> 04:32:59,650
Two hits is so scary.

4307
04:33:00,650 --> 04:33:01,250
Oh, no!

4308
04:33:01,790 --> 04:33:01,790
Fuck!

4309
04:33:03,370 --> 04:33:03,970
It's fine.

4310
04:33:05,090 --> 04:33:05,550
It's fine.

4311
04:33:06,710 --> 04:33:08,190
I only had two hits and I dreamed.

4312
04:33:12,840 --> 04:33:13,360
Okay.

4313
04:33:17,560 --> 04:33:19,320
Two hits and a dream.

4314
04:33:19,680 --> 04:33:20,220
Slow and steady.

4315
04:33:22,240 --> 04:33:25,220
Oh my gosh, that's not slow and steady anymore.

4316
04:33:29,300 --> 04:33:29,780
Okay.

4317
04:33:30,860 --> 04:33:31,660
That's fine.

4318
04:33:32,680 --> 04:33:33,400
Twin.

4319
04:33:34,100 --> 04:33:34,240
Woo!

4320
04:33:36,080 --> 04:33:36,800

04:33:41,650 --> 04:33:42,630
That's fine.

4323
04:33:44,410 --> 04:33:46,570
I'm okay with taking one hit there.

4324
04:33:48,750 --> 04:33:50,170

Where are they?

4357
04:36:42,960 --> 04:36:47,100
The church I sing is for the end of our old lives.

4358
04:36:47,580 --> 04:36:50,760
Here at the end of times, our paradise crumbled beneath us.

4359
04:36:51,040 --> 04:36:52,040
Lee and friend alike.

4360
04:36:52,480 --> 04:36:54,380
All soon to be consumed.

4361
04:36:55,400 --> 04:36:58,120
What a choice do we pour, rich and live.

4362
04:36:58,340 --> 04:37:00,760
Our cruel fate leaves us with only one task.

4363
04:37:01,080 --> 04:37:03,920
Dear friend, Miss Hornet, forgive us, but we beg one more.

One last time.

4368
04:37:41,750 --> 04:37:42,910
Let the games begin.

4369
04:37:43,970 --> 04:37:44,210
What?

4370
04:37:46,050 --> 04:37:47,210
It's a party?

4371
04:37:49,890 --> 04:37:51,870
Ain't no party like a flea party.

4372
04:37:53,270 --> 04:37:55,090
Oh my god, that was so fast.

4373
04:37:55,250 --> 04:37:56,550
It's the festival of the flea.

4374
04:37:57,910 --> 04:37:59,310
Sacrifice the party.

4375
04:37:59,690 --> 04:38:02,350
Oh my god, look at this John ass meat.

4376
04:38:04,090 --> 04:38:04,650
Oh.

4377
04:38:06,590 --> 04:38:07,070
Oh.

4378
04:38:08,270 --> 04:38:08,590
Oh.

4379
04:38:10,910 --> 04:38:11,770
Wait a minute.

4380
04:38:12,070 --> 04:38:12,390
Here one.

4381
04:38:12,490 --> 04:38:16,530
How shameful for the world to end while poor Christ still has so much living in him.

4382
04:38:16,990 --> 04:38:22,450
How sweet of joy will you play the flea bounce game that I may appreciate the beauty of your agile fort while away my doom?

4383
04:38:22,850 --> 04:38:23,730
The play is simple.

4384
04:38:24,070 --> 04:38:27,670
Leap up and keep bouncing on the fleas who fly past for as long as you're able to.

4385
04:38:28,130 --> 04:38:33,850
Okay guys, um, so how, so how do I get, okay guys?

4386
04:38:35,990 --> 04:38:39,390
Oh, I have to get...

4387
04:38:39,390 --> 04:38:43,830
Oh, Alejandro, thank you for the super chat, please.

4388
04:38:44,490 --> 04:38:45,910
Oh, okay.

4389
04:38:50,030 --> 04:38:52,330
Okay, he said it was simple.

4390
04:38:52,470 --> 04:38:53,370
It's free, right?

4391
04:38:54,530 --> 04:38:56,110
It's free, right?

4392
04:38:56,710 --> 04:38:57,150
Okay.

4393
04:38:58,430 --> 04:39:00,330
How do I do this?

4394
04:39:01,790 --> 04:39:02,010
Oh.

4395
04:39:03,590 --> 04:39:04,250
Oh.

4396
04:39:17,530 --> 04:39:18,890
Oh, that's funny.

4397
04:39:19,030 --> 04:39:19,470
I like that.

4398
04:39:20,870 --> 04:39:21,890
Are you serious?

4399
04:39:29,310 --> 04:39:29,870
No!

4400
04:39:33,890 --> 04:39:34,890
What are you doing?

04:43:40,160 --> 04:43:41,900
My dear, my dastard game has ended.

4443
04:43:42,080 --> 04:43:43,240
You have proven yourself the champion.

4444
04:43:43,540 --> 04:43:44,600
None can best your score.

4445
04:43:44,760 --> 04:43:45,300
You have shameless.

4446
04:43:45,300 --> 04:43:46,500

04:43:48,680 --> 04:43:50,220

4454
04:43:56,480 --> 04:43:57,340
How do I do Dodge?

4455
04:43:58,180 --> 04:44:00,240
Nothing left but to test ourselves.

4456
04:44:01,420 --> 04:44:18,160

4463
04:44:56,570 --> 04:44:57,470
Oh my god!

4464
04:44:59,170 --> 04:45:00,450
That's so scary.

4465
04:45:01,330 --> 04:45:02,050
Can I hit them?

4466
04:45:04,610 --> 04:45:06,430
Does hitting count as dodgy?

4467
04:45:07,430 --> 04:45:07,930
Ah!

4468
04:45:11,330 --> 04:45:12,330

04:45:15,270 --> 04:45:16,690
Okay, I thought I had...

4472
04:45:16,690 --> 04:45:17,410
Okay, that's good.

4473
04:45:18,750 --> 04:45:19,390
Okay, that's good.

4474
04:45:21,310 --> 04:45:22,570
I can pogo them.

4475
04:45:22,670 --> 04:45:24,460
That's good to know, because I...

4476
04:45:24,910 --> 04:45:27,390
I was like, oh god, this is harder if I can't pogo.

4477
04:45:29,630 --> 04:45:30,130
What?

4478
04:45:31,330 --> 04:45:31,730
Okay.

4479
04:45:33,390 --> 04:45:34,830
Oh my god, wait!

4480
04:45:35,230 --> 04:45:36,390
This is so hard!

4481
04:45:38,650 --> 04:45:40,710
Okay, I can pogo and harpoon them.

4482
04:45:40,790 --> 04:45:41,630
That's good to know.

4483
04:45:43,690 --> 04:45:45,790
I think the bouncing was more fun.

4484
04:45:53,440 --> 04:45:53,960

04:45:57,960 --> 04:46:01,120

04:46:05,780 --> 04:46:06,900
Oh my god, big boy.

4488
04:46:07,340 --> 04:46:08,600
What the fuck?

4489
04:46:09,080 --> 04:46:13,460
What do I do when they take away all I love?

4490
04:46:14,580 --> 04:46:15,580
Everything I love.

4491
04:46:17,060 --> 04:46:17,840

04:48:09,720 --> 04:48:11,280
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4520
04:48:14,410 --> 04:48:16,870

Jesus Christ, so fast.

4522
04:48:25,790 --> 04:48:27,830
Um, okay, I was gonna say it.

4523
04:48:28,550 --> 04:48:30,230
But that's not fair.

4524
04:48:32,250 --> 04:48:32,670
What the fuck?

4525
04:48:32,730 --> 04:48:33,870
This platform just came back.

4526
04:48:34,410 --> 04:48:35,690
You can't just take it from me.

4527
04:48:35,890 --> 04:48:37,970
Doesn't work like that

4528
04:48:57,960 --> 04:49:00,660
How was that fair?

4529
04:49:01,040 --> 04:49:03,340
How was that fair?

4530
04:49:03,720 --> 04:49:05,260
He took it away!

4531
04:49:05,580 --> 04:49:06,700
I couldn't have floated!

4532
04:49:07,220 --> 04:49:08,280
I had to poke him!

4533
04:49:10,180 --> 04:49:11,940
Oh my god, that was so bullshit.

4534
04:49:12,160 --> 04:49:13,280
I was literally waiting.

4535
04:49:13,740 --> 04:49:15,940
Oh my god.

4536
04:49:16,240 --> 04:49:19,740
I was literally waiting for him, waiting for my platform.

4537
04:49:32,240 --> 04:49:33,060
Here we go.

4538
04:49:34,740 --> 04:49:36,580
Literally, it's all just RNG.

4539
04:49:39,740 --> 04:49:40,940
It's like...

4540
04:49:43,080 --> 04:49:44,060
Okay.

4541
04:49:46,900 --> 04:49:48,100

Every time the big boy, he goes so fast that I can't even pogo him in time.

4547
04:50:11,720 --> 04:50:13,100
I couldn't pogo him in time.

4548
04:50:13,300 --> 04:50:14,240
He went so fast.

4549
04:50:15,020 --> 04:50:16,480
I was like, do I float or pogo?

4550
04:50:16,660 --> 04:50:17,160
Do I float or?

4551
04:50:17,240 --> 04:50:17,920
I should have floated.

4552
04:50:18,060 --> 04:50:18,900
I should have floated.

4553
04:50:19,220 --> 04:50:20,840

4589
04:53:23,860 --> 04:53:24,920
Oh my god.

4590
04:53:25,840 --> 04:53:25,980
Oh.

4591
04:53:31,220 --> 04:53:31,780
Oh.

4592
04:53:32,300 --> 04:53:32,820
Oh.

4593
04:53:34,980 --> 04:53:35,700
Oh.

4594
04:53:36,440 --> 04:53:36,600
Oh.

4595
04:53:36,900 --> 04:53:37,160
Oh.

4596
04:53:42,560 --> 04:53:42,600

4597
04:53:42,600 --> 04:53:43,180
Oh.

4598
04:53:47,400 --> 04:53:48,600
Are you serious?

4599
04:53:48,680 --> 04:53:50,040
I literally just got here.

4600
04:53:50,800 --> 04:53:51,800
Oh my god.

4601
04:53:51,900 --> 04:53:52,740
I'm so sad.

4602
04:53:52,840 --> 04:53:53,480
I'm so sad.

4603
04:53:54,060 --> 04:53:54,780
I'm so sad.

4604
04:53:56,460 --> 04:53:59,100
I'm gonna go to bed and all you can think about is

4605
04:54:03,580 --> 04:54:15,800
No, we're ending we're ending today with this I need my upgrade Yeah, I'm full focus I'm full focus I close my eyes and

4606
04:54:21,400 --> 04:54:28,500
It's literally just RNG I feel like Okay Okay, that's fine.

4607
04:54:29,520 --> 04:54:31,220
It's like, if you get good BDRNG.

4608
04:54:36,000 --> 04:54:36,600
Jesus.

4609
04:54:40,640 --> 04:54:41,000
Okay.

4610
04:54:47,360 --> 04:54:47,960
Okay.

4611
04:54:50,780 --> 04:54:51,840
Oh my god.

4612
04:54:52,820 --> 04:54:53,400
That was close.

4613
04:54:53,600 --> 04:54:53,800
Oh.

4614
04:54:54,520 --> 04:54:54,720
Oh.

4615
04:54:55,180 --> 04:54:56,260
That scared me.

4616
04:54:57,580 --> 04:54:57,900
Oh!

4617
04:54:58,540 --> 04:55:00,220
It knocked me down too!

4618
04:55:02,460 --> 04:55:03,000
Oh!

4619
04:55:05,280 --> 04:55:05,820
Oh!

4620
04:55:08,080 --> 04:55:09,440
The stupid RNG.

4621
04:55:10,140 --> 04:55:11,640
The double tap, yeah.

4622
04:55:12,120 --> 04:55:13,700
RNG, bleed generator.

4623
04:55:13,860 --> 04:55:15,820
I feel like this would make or break the speedrun.

4624
04:55:17,000 --> 04:55:19,100
I mean, unless you don't want the nail upgrade.

4625
04:55:19,900 --> 04:55:22,100
I don't know, maybe they're too good for the nail upgrade.

4626
04:55:28,070 --> 04:55:28,610
Okay.

4627
04:55:29,810 --> 04:55:32,990
Okay, I didn't think she would hit me, but okay.

4628
04:55:35,870 --> 04:55:36,830
Oh

4629
04:55:54,200 --> 04:55:56,440

4634
04:56:45,310 --> 04:56:54,930
okay now starting now that's all why did i save all of them i should have left like five 10 of them to die.

4635
04:56:55,630 --> 04:57:00,670
It was my mistake.

4636
04:57:01,810 --> 04:57:03,930
I should have left more of them to die.

4637
04:57:09,230 --> 04:57:09,910
Okay.

4638
04:57:12,390 --> 04:57:15,110
I didn't think it would curve to me.

4639
04:57:15,730 --> 04:57:18,350
I thought I was like, I'll just wait here.

4640
04:57:19,130 --> 04:57:21,110
Let's just wait here.

4641
04:57:23,470 --> 04:57:24,150
Okay.

4642
04:57:27,370 --> 04:57:35,270

4643
04:57:40,000 --> 04:57:57,540

4644
04:58:01,700 --> 04:58:02,420
Whoa!

4645
04:58:03,020 --> 04:58:09,080
A fucking curse.

4646
04:58:09,840 --> 04:58:11,280
I can't have nice things here.

4647
04:58:11,960 --> 04:58:19,600
Oh my

4648
04:58:32,300 --> 04:58:32,500

Oh my god.

4650
04:58:33,820 --> 04:58:34,500
Oh my god.

4651
04:58:34,920 --> 04:58:35,540
Oh my god.

4652
04:58:35,640 --> 04:58:36,340
Oh my god.

4653
04:58:36,880 --> 04:58:38,420
Oh my god.

4654
04:58:39,300 --> 04:58:40,160
I made it.

4655
04:58:43,140 --> 04:58:45,320
I did it.

4656
04:58:45,900 --> 04:58:47,220
Oh my god.

4657
04:58:48,080 --> 04:58:48,720
off leave.

4658
04:58:49,360 --> 04:58:51,220
Impressive was your performance.

4659
04:58:51,800 --> 04:58:56,260
Your score exceeds even my own PC skills so nice.

4660
04:58:56,900 --> 04:58:59,320
Moments of where everything ends can be unexpected.

4661
04:58:59,620 --> 04:59:01,740
I congratulate you, champion.

4662
04:59:02,060 --> 04:59:02,900
I did it.

4663
04:59:03,960 --> 04:59:04,260
Nice.

4664
04:59:05,600 --> 04:59:06,400
Nice.

4665
04:59:07,360 --> 04:59:09,040
That's worth it.

4666
04:59:09,780 --> 04:59:11,860
Who's in charge of the last one?

4667
04:59:12,080 --> 04:59:13,140
Grishkin, okay.

4668
04:59:13,960 --> 04:59:14,640
Nice.

4669
04:59:15,560 --> 04:59:15,960
Nice.

4670
04:59:18,080 --> 04:59:21,940
Good friends of Lee is you, Miss Horton, and now must join and drink much.

4671
04:59:22,400 --> 04:59:23,320
Be merry before our ends.

4672
04:59:23,500 --> 04:59:24,220
No trash for you.

4673
04:59:24,260 --> 04:59:26,060
Wait, it's not him, not her.

4674
04:59:27,520 --> 04:59:28,720
I like our festival.

4675
04:59:28,900 --> 04:59:35,160
While the world comes around us, we will laugh and dance and frolic me thinking of the Super Chat thinking, thank you.

4676
04:59:35,180 --> 04:59:36,200
You juggled them now.

4677
04:59:36,340 --> 04:59:37,520
They juggled you.

4678
04:59:38,580 --> 04:59:40,640
Make merry of us and play some of the games of old.

4679
04:59:41,120 --> 04:59:43,020
My time is slim, Flea Master.

4680
04:59:43,160 --> 04:59:47,940
If I am to join your games, no, it will need to hone my skills for the greater trial of Masoon Faced Below.

4681
04:59:48,080 --> 04:59:49,260
Of course, of course.

4682
04:59:49,600 --> 04:59:50,240
Joy of learning.

4683
04:59:51,060 --> 04:59:52,780
Any reasons why my eyes must turn it.

4684
04:59:52,920 --> 04:59:53,380
And look here.

4685
04:59:53,500 --> 04:59:56,920
We have flea juggle where the challenge is strike fleas upward and keep them off.

4686
04:59:57,420 --> 04:59:57,860
Oh my god.

4687
04:59:58,100 --> 04:59:58,340
Okay.

4688
04:59:58,920 --> 05:00:00,240
Okay, here we go.

4689
05:00:00,400 --> 05:00:02,000
It's juggling time.

4690
05:00:02,300 --> 05:00:03,600
Here we go.

4691
05:00:04,200 --> 05:00:06,140
Apparently this is the hardest one.

4692
05:00:06,520 --> 05:00:07,240
How do I do it?

4693
05:00:09,600 --> 05:00:18,060
One, two, three, one, two, three, four, five.

4694
05:00:20,320 --> 05:00:22,440
Guys, I'm a little worried.

4695
05:00:25,480 --> 05:00:27,620
Oh, there's free three strikes.

4696
05:00:29,140 --> 05:00:31,040
Oh, I got my second chance.

4697
05:00:31,240 --> 05:00:32,480
I was like, why is he here?

4698
05:00:33,860 --> 05:00:34,800
Oh, my God.

4699
05:00:34,940 --> 05:00:36,720
Wait, I have to keep jug.

4700
05:00:36,860 --> 05:00:37,620
Oh, my God.

4701
05:00:37,900 --> 05:00:39,040
It's not per hit.

4702
05:00:39,500 --> 05:00:43,000
It's like how many I've completed juggling them.

4703
05:00:43,140 --> 05:00:44,000
Wait, what the fuck?

4704
05:00:44,400 --> 05:00:45,400
What the fuck?

4705
05:00:46,220 --> 05:00:47,540
Oh, my God.

4706
05:00:49,280 --> 05:00:49,840
Okay.

4707
05:00:50,320 --> 05:00:51,560
I get it now.

4708
05:00:51,900 --> 05:00:53,000
I get it.

4709
05:00:54,680 --> 05:00:55,680
It's perfectly.

4710
05:01:00,360 --> 05:01:02,200
Okay, three times each one.

4711
05:01:05,900 --> 05:01:06,380
Okay.

4712
05:01:12,030 --> 05:01:13,350
Hit them up too.

4713
05:01:14,130 --> 05:01:15,210
I mean, that's late.

4714
05:01:16,610 --> 05:01:17,570
I mean, that's the plan.

4715
05:01:18,310 --> 05:01:19,390
I'll jump juggle them.

4716
05:01:22,610 --> 05:01:23,390
Oh my god.

4717
05:01:23,410 --> 05:01:24,490
God, what?

4718
05:01:26,870 --> 05:01:33,030
Okay, I didn't realize that like, he goes so fast.

4719
05:01:36,390 --> 05:01:37,710
Oh my god.

4720
05:01:40,030 --> 05:01:42,410
He goes so fast, it's like...

4721
05:01:48,840 --> 05:01:50,020
Holy shit.

4722
05:01:52,900 --> 05:01:54,140
Oh my god.

4723
05:01:54,320 --> 05:01:54,640
No!

4724
05:01:55,620 --> 05:01:56,900
Oh my god!

4725
05:01:57,820 --> 05:01:58,620
Jumping is...

4726
05:01:58,620 --> 05:01:59,800
Oh my god.

4727
05:02:01,620 --> 05:02:02,060
Holy shit.

4728
05:02:02,200 --> 05:02:03,140
Okay, we'll do it again.

4729
05:02:04,140 --> 05:02:05,800
Oh, it gets some higher, which means...

4730
05:02:05,800 --> 05:02:07,420
Oh, they gain more motetment.

4731
05:02:07,540 --> 05:02:09,420
I didn't realize they fall down faster.

4732
05:02:09,980 --> 05:02:11,980
Okay, now that I know, I won't do that.

4733
05:02:13,580 --> 05:02:14,980
I thought that...

4734
05:02:16,700 --> 05:02:20,540
I thought me jumping would make it so they go higher.

4735
05:02:21,900 --> 05:02:24,280
So, you don't have to worry about it.

4736
05:02:25,300 --> 05:02:29,560
I have more time, but I didn't realize They'll fucking fall down faster.

4737
05:02:29,780 --> 05:02:39,890
That's fucked up Jesus Christ if I didn't have enough things to worry about They gave this one they like drug that guy up

4738
05:02:45,240 --> 05:02:46,800
Oh my god.

4739
05:02:47,120 --> 05:02:47,820
Oh my god.

4740
05:02:47,980 --> 05:02:48,820
Are you serious?

4741
05:02:49,420 --> 05:02:54,820
I got I actually I didn't realize I can't I have to stay on the platform Oh my okay.

4742
05:02:56,060 --> 05:02:58,900
This is frustrating Only because I have to do it three times.

4743
05:03:00,680 --> 05:03:01,440
Slash front is better?

4744
05:03:01,720 --> 05:03:02,380
Okay, I'll try that.

4745
05:03:06,280 --> 05:03:07,000
Oh, I didn't.

4746
05:03:07,380 --> 05:03:08,160
I didn't know that.

4747
05:03:11,980 --> 05:03:13,960
I didn't realize you could slash up front.

4748
05:03:16,680 --> 05:03:18,160
That makes it so much easier.

4749
05:03:18,420 --> 05:03:18,840
What the fuck?

4750
05:03:23,190 --> 05:03:25,010
All right, what?

4751
05:03:25,470 --> 05:03:26,770
Ooh, whoa.

4752
05:03:33,320 --> 05:03:36,040
Okay Oh

4753
05:03:41,270 --> 05:03:44,350
My god, I can't because they were all

4754
05:03:53,190 --> 05:03:54,470
I didn't

4755
05:03:57,760 --> 05:04:02,320
realize that I took him all the way there

4756
05:04:10,800 --> 05:04:15,280
Okay Okay

4757
05:04:20,370 --> 05:04:22,470
Okay, one more.

4758
05:04:23,530 --> 05:04:24,890
This one sucks.

4759
05:04:25,710 --> 05:04:27,050
Because you're so fast.

4760
05:04:31,870 --> 05:04:32,190
Okay.

4761
05:04:33,330 --> 05:04:34,590
All right.

4762
05:04:39,960 --> 05:04:41,200
There you go.

4763
05:04:42,920 --> 05:04:42,920
There

4764
05:04:51,870 --> 05:04:54,390
you go.

4765
05:04:54,750 --> 05:04:55,730
There you go.

4766
05:05:03,300 --> 05:05:03,960
There you go.

4767
05:05:04,300 --> 05:05:05,260
Fucking freak out.

4768
05:05:05,980 --> 05:05:06,800
Oh!

4769
05:05:07,600 --> 05:05:08,200
Oh!

4770
05:05:11,200 --> 05:05:12,460
Oh my god.

4771
05:05:13,520 --> 05:05:14,810
Oh my god, I fucked up.

4772
05:05:16,980 --> 05:05:17,520
Too

4773
05:05:22,060 --> 05:05:22,440
many.

4774
05:05:23,220 --> 05:05:24,960
I couldn't juggle all of it.

4775
05:05:26,120 --> 05:05:27,160
Oh my god.

4776
05:05:28,880 --> 05:05:30,000
There was so many.

4777
05:05:30,420 --> 05:05:32,040
I need like what, 27?

4778
05:05:32,720 --> 05:05:33,040
2?

4779
05:05:35,120 --> 05:05:37,120
I actually split them up.

4780
05:05:40,360 --> 05:05:42,060
I'm just gonna do it fast.

4781
05:05:43,060 --> 05:05:44,700
Because like, this part is so slow.

4782
05:05:44,780 --> 05:06:08,180
so that there you go okay i'll hit it at like the last one there you go one three okay oh

4783
05:06:12,550 --> 05:06:18,070
there we go three four

4784
05:06:22,210 --> 05:06:22,890
No!

4785
05:06:25,070 --> 05:06:27,110
They split up!

4786
05:06:28,070 --> 05:06:29,590
That's so messed up.

4787
05:06:33,640 --> 05:06:34,020
Okay.

4788
05:06:34,640 --> 05:06:36,560
I lost two right there.

4789
05:06:37,560 --> 05:06:39,080
Because I got confused.

4790
05:06:41,260 --> 05:06:41,660
Ah!

4791
05:06:42,260 --> 05:06:44,240
They're all two grouped up!

4792
05:06:44,620 --> 05:06:46,380
They're so grouped up!

4793
05:06:47,900 --> 05:06:50,060
Do I need to change my crest?

4794
05:06:50,160 --> 05:06:51,520
Okay, we'll make it even longer.

4795
05:06:51,560 --> 05:06:53,460
Wait, actually, we can, actually, I realize.

4796
05:06:54,000 --> 05:07:22,040
because it's hunter right um let's see where's the range okay it's hunt or is a reaper no it's reaper that has the longest reaper and then we can do where's the long stop there you go that's the longest i can do oh tools don't work okay all right

4797
05:07:25,640 --> 05:07:27,060
Oh, it is slower, though.

4798
05:07:27,160 --> 05:07:27,560
You're right.

4799
05:07:28,020 --> 05:07:29,200
Maybe it's not a good idea.

4800
05:07:30,300 --> 05:07:31,420
I realize it is slower.

4801
05:07:31,660 --> 05:07:33,260
It might fuck me up.

4802
05:07:35,780 --> 05:07:37,160
Oh, yeah, I don't like that.

4803
05:07:37,440 --> 05:07:39,060
Oh, I'm going to swap it off.

4804
05:07:40,160 --> 05:07:41,100
Yeah, it's too slow.

4805
05:07:41,420 --> 05:07:42,520
It's way too slow.

4806
05:07:42,780 --> 05:07:43,980
I'm not a fan of it.

4807
05:07:46,260 --> 05:07:47,920
Yeah, I'm going to go back to Wonder.

4808
05:07:47,980 --> 05:07:49,400
I think Wonder was the best.

4809
05:07:49,500 --> 05:07:51,120
I don't think range matters for me.

4810
05:07:52,800 --> 05:07:53,160
Oh, wait.

4811
05:07:53,160 --> 05:07:53,840
That's the beast.

4812
05:07:54,000 --> 05:07:55,400
I'm not letting that piece out.

4813
05:07:57,900 --> 05:07:58,740
Hunter works nicely?

4814
05:07:59,020 --> 05:07:59,560
Okay, we'll try.

4815
05:08:03,630 --> 05:08:05,110
Okay, tools don't work, right?

4816
05:08:05,330 --> 05:08:05,670
Okay.

4817
05:08:06,450 --> 05:08:09,210
I'll just, I won't, I'll do it like a naked hunter.

4818
05:08:23,850 --> 05:08:23,930
Okay.

4819
05:08:29,780 --> 05:08:30,300
Okay.

4820
05:08:30,740 --> 05:08:33,220
I'm gonna try and focus as much as I can.

4821
05:08:36,760 --> 05:08:37,500
There you are.

4822
05:08:47,320 --> 05:08:48,680
Oh my god.

4823
05:08:53,900 --> 05:08:55,540
Holy shit.

4824
05:08:58,440 --> 05:08:58,880
Where?

4825
05:09:07,300 --> 05:09:08,400
Oh my god.

4826
05:09:08,740 --> 05:09:10,720
This is so scary.

4827
05:09:20,290 --> 05:09:22,420
I feel like...

4828
05:09:23,140 --> 05:09:25,840
I should have definitely got more from that one.

4829
05:09:27,660 --> 05:09:28,480
No!

4830
05:09:29,400 --> 05:09:31,400
I dashed!

4831
05:09:32,160 --> 05:09:33,400
I dashed!

4832
05:09:36,300 --> 05:09:37,320
That much!

4833
05:09:38,220 --> 05:09:39,420
Okay, 30!

4834
05:09:40,000 --> 05:09:40,560
30!

4835
05:09:41,580 --> 05:09:42,640
I had to...

4836
05:09:43,400 --> 05:09:45,580
That was a ring!

4837
05:09:46,380 --> 05:09:46,540
Oh!

4838
05:09:50,780 --> 05:09:52,580
I accidentally dashed it.

4839
05:09:52,820 --> 05:09:53,640
I'm so sad.

4840
05:09:53,740 --> 05:09:55,020
It was a good juggle too.

4841
05:09:57,500 --> 05:09:59,380
I'm just jumping for this.

4842
05:09:59,400 --> 05:10:02,160
because I want to get to these slow ones out of the way.

4843
05:10:05,620 --> 05:10:07,300
I'm not jumping anymore.

4844
05:10:07,960 --> 05:10:08,820
I'm not jumping.

4845
05:10:10,300 --> 05:10:11,820
I'm not jumping anymore.

4846
05:10:14,140 --> 05:10:14,440
Okay.

4847
05:10:17,520 --> 05:10:17,840
Alright.

4848
05:10:21,750 --> 05:10:21,970
Alright.

4849
05:10:21,970 --> 05:10:22,050
Oh!

4850
05:10:24,450 --> 05:10:26,890
I need my final nail upgrade.

4851
05:10:27,030 --> 05:10:27,930
You don't understand.

4852
05:10:34,590 --> 05:10:35,210
Okay.

4853
05:10:41,070 --> 05:10:41,570
Okay.

4854
05:10:42,370 --> 05:10:44,290
Uh, Finn, thank you for the- Oh my god!

4855
05:10:47,450 --> 05:10:47,950
I'm sorry!

4856
05:10:48,190 --> 05:10:50,050
Child, I was looking at money!

4857
05:10:52,430 --> 05:10:54,330
Thank you for the Ahasua.

4858
05:10:56,330 --> 05:10:57,750
That's my bad.

4859
05:10:59,750 --> 05:11:04,070
Thank you for the- I'm sorry, child.

4860
05:11:04,510 --> 05:11:05,590
I was looking at money.

4861
05:11:06,050 --> 05:11:07,530
You understand, right?

4862
05:11:09,550 --> 05:11:12,150
I got distracted by money.

4863
05:11:18,840 --> 05:11:20,590
There you go.

4864
05:11:32,400 --> 05:11:33,200
The ring!

4865
05:11:33,560 --> 05:11:34,680
That shouldn't count!

4866
05:11:35,600 --> 05:11:38,800
Thank you for the hacka soup, but thank you, thank you.

4867
05:11:38,860 --> 05:11:40,860
It was out of the ring!

4868
05:11:41,700 --> 05:11:43,080
That shouldn't count!

4869
05:11:44,840 --> 05:11:49,880
When you're out of the ring, you shouldn't be a, you shouldn't count towards my, my mistake.

4870
05:11:49,900 --> 05:11:50,800
mistakes

4871
05:11:58,020 --> 05:12:02,300
okay oh

4872
05:12:07,600 --> 05:12:20,790
okay oh

4873
05:12:24,370 --> 05:12:39,130
okay one this should be like two points because like if you're making me hit like an extra point that should be two like I don't understand oh

4874
05:12:46,060 --> 05:12:49,300
my god oh Oh my god.

4875
05:13:16,650 --> 05:13:17,610
Oh my god.

4876
05:13:18,230 --> 05:13:20,410
Oh my

4877
05:13:31,380 --> 05:13:31,880
god, it's five.

4878
05:13:32,200 --> 05:13:33,040
Oh my god, we did it.

4879
05:13:33,080 --> 05:13:34,120
We fucking did it.

4880
05:13:39,880 --> 05:13:41,800
Let them all get brain damage.

4881
05:13:42,120 --> 05:13:43,000
I don't care.

4882
05:13:43,360 --> 05:13:44,540
Let them all get concussions.

4883
05:13:44,760 --> 05:13:45,240
It's over.

4884
05:13:45,680 --> 05:13:49,520
You have proven yourself a champion of each of our flea games.

4885
05:13:50,020 --> 05:13:53,980
I am confident now that the grand champion of our festival has emerged.

4886
05:13:54,180 --> 05:13:56,060
It is none other than yourself, of course.

4887
05:13:56,260 --> 05:13:59,120
And thusly must our final ceremony begin.

4888
05:13:59,640 --> 05:14:00,920
Please prepare yourself.

4889
05:14:02,740 --> 05:14:04,720
You can have concussions for all I care.

4890
05:14:05,020 --> 05:14:06,140
I got what I needed.

4891
05:14:07,040 --> 05:14:11,920
Gathered here we are to honor the grand champion of this very final of all festivals.

4892
05:14:12,560 --> 05:14:15,500
Now, Miss Hornet, strike the great epitome of all your money.

4893
05:14:16,420 --> 05:14:16,880
Money!

4894
05:14:18,140 --> 05:14:18,740
Money!

4895
05:14:20,440 --> 05:14:20,960
Money!

4896
05:14:23,540 --> 05:14:23,800
Money!

4897
05:14:26,680 --> 05:14:27,800
Free money!

4898
05:14:29,740 --> 05:14:30,240
Oh!

4899
05:14:34,100 --> 05:14:34,660
Yay!

4900
05:14:35,580 --> 05:14:36,640
Wish granted!

4901
05:14:37,980 --> 05:14:39,860
My final nail upgrade.

4902
05:14:43,440 --> 05:14:45,040
I should have brought my magnet.

4903
05:14:45,700 --> 05:14:47,020
I bet all that money is gone.

4904
05:14:47,220 --> 05:14:47,800
Yep, it's gone.

4905
05:14:48,080 --> 05:14:50,060
I should have brought my magnet.

4906
05:14:50,720 --> 05:14:51,640
Oh my god.

4907
05:14:52,120 --> 05:14:52,620
Rest in peace.

4908
05:14:52,780 --> 05:14:53,600
All that money.

4909
05:14:53,980 --> 05:14:56,580
I didn't realize it was just this and here.

4910
05:14:56,980 --> 05:14:59,260
I thought the money would wait for me.

4911
05:14:59,880 --> 05:15:03,860
And so the great ceremony has reached its climax and its great champion has emerged.

4912
05:15:04,260 --> 05:15:06,160
Thank you for spending your last moments with us here.

4913
05:15:06,260 --> 05:15:11,560
Miss Horton, though the world will soon end and our paradise will crumble, the memories of friendship will all share.

4914
05:15:11,840 --> 05:15:14,420
Shall surely echo through the oncoming world.

4915
05:15:15,460 --> 05:15:18,720
Fleetmaster, your sentiment is kind, but the world will not end.

4916
05:15:19,260 --> 05:15:22,200
Oh, how good of you to speak words of hope for our benefit.

4917
05:15:22,600 --> 05:15:24,060
But we have accepted our fate.

I almost think I...

05:16:43,180 --> 05:16:45,460
Taking me home, getting me out of here.

4926
05:16:46,320 --> 05:16:47,900
Get me out of here.

4927
05:16:48,680 --> 05:16:50,860
I'm never coming back.

4928
05:16:51,800 --> 05:16:52,800
Oh, Bellheart.

4929
05:17:01,650 --> 05:17:02,610
It's time.

4930
05:17:02,810 --> 05:17:04,870
It's time to get my nails polished.

4931
05:17:05,090 --> 05:17:07,610
Hello, hello, hello.

4932
05:17:11,630 --> 05:17:12,550

4941
05:17:41,220 --> 05:17:43,760
There isn't a sea, you return.

4942
05:17:43,900 --> 05:18:15,580
little I was such a glimmer of life even as the dark descends upon us all all these pilgrims gathered here I had not expected so many to survive the destruction beyond these bells suggested worse indeed these things should be worse would be worse but for your tall warrior friend heard of those shining rings who so fortunate chose our town the camp that brave bugged the axe alone to guard our town and those plague pilgrims who flee for it for efforts our shells are safe the long long Shira can remain at that time I do not dare to consider.

4943
05:18:16,040 --> 05:18:17,040
Wait, did I do this?

4944
05:18:17,240 --> 05:18:18,880
No, no, it's not my fault.

4945
05:18:19,280 --> 05:18:20,260
Wait, how do I?

4946
05:18:21,100 --> 05:18:22,780
How do I punish my nail?

4947
05:18:24,820 --> 05:18:25,420
Guys.

4948
05:18:27,920 --> 05:18:30,980
Guys, how do I...

4949
05:18:30,980 --> 05:18:32,500
Did he got raptured?

4950
05:18:35,040 --> 05:18:38,360
Guys, where's the nail man?

4951
05:18:41,700 --> 05:18:43,000
Where is he?

4952
05:18:44,100 --> 05:18:46,700
Where the fuck is the grave in the ground?

4953
05:18:46,700 --> 05:18:48,440
I don't fucking know what that is.

4954
05:18:48,660 --> 05:18:50,220
Why did he speak in riddles?

4955
05:18:53,000 --> 05:18:55,800
Just tell me where it is.

4956
05:18:56,460 --> 05:18:58,180
He's in Shellwood.

4957
05:18:59,760 --> 05:19:00,060
Okay.

4958
05:19:01,160 --> 05:19:02,920
Where the fuck is Shellwood?

4959
05:19:04,920 --> 05:19:06,980
Why does he speak in the riddles?

4960
05:19:07,780 --> 05:19:10,200
Where the fuck is the grave in Shellwood?

4961
05:19:11,480 --> 05:19:13,420
There's a graveyard here?

4962
05:19:14,640 --> 05:19:15,620
Is that it?

4963
05:19:17,660 --> 05:19:18,420
Is that here?

4964
05:19:21,160 --> 05:19:22,340
Is that where he is?

4965
05:19:22,500 --> 05:19:23,600
Bro, why are you sad?

4966
05:19:26,860 --> 05:19:27,340
Alright.

4967
05:19:28,240 --> 05:19:29,460
Why is he sad?

4968
05:19:29,620 --> 05:19:30,260
I don't understand.

4969
05:19:32,060 --> 05:19:34,340
Your job is to appease me.

4970
05:19:34,540 --> 05:19:35,500
Make me happy.

4971
05:19:35,940 --> 05:19:36,500
What the fuck?

4972
05:19:36,680 --> 05:19:37,360
Oh, shit.

4973
05:19:38,160 --> 05:19:39,500
I even... Oh my god.

4974
05:19:39,640 --> 05:19:41,720
There's so many things going on my screen.

4975
05:19:42,620 --> 05:19:49,840
I... I don't love I like when Shakira is here because it's so, it's really, really hard to see.

4976
05:19:51,080 --> 05:19:53,340
Shakira, you pit yourself against the black-threaded bugs?

4977
05:19:53,720 --> 05:19:55,820
Their danger is full, even for the hardened warrior.

4978
05:19:56,620 --> 05:19:58,200
I relish such danger.

4979
05:19:58,560 --> 05:19:59,860
I have little choices besides.

4980
05:20:00,260 --> 05:20:02,020
These creatures besiege the town within.

4981
05:20:02,180 --> 05:20:03,560
Their relentless, empowered.

4982
05:20:04,080 --> 05:20:04,720
It is a void.

4983
05:20:05,220 --> 05:20:08,200
Stretched up into this world in its husk, I know it well.

4984
05:20:08,520 --> 05:20:09,660
It's forced its nature.

4985
05:20:09,960 --> 05:20:13,040
But since it's soul within, it'll drive precariously towards it.

4986
05:20:13,900 --> 05:20:17,120
As you say, many bugs now huddled within the bells.

4987
05:20:17,500 --> 05:20:19,780
Nowhere else is safe with this black thread rising.

4988
05:20:20,420 --> 05:20:24,120
Some luck at least I chose to remain and can offer my rings as a fence.

4989
05:20:24,820 --> 05:20:26,760
Shakira, I seek to end this new disaster.

4990
05:20:27,420 --> 05:20:27,800
For it.

4991
05:20:28,540 --> 05:20:32,200
For in it I share much blame, but no, I shall need time to complete my task.

4992
05:20:32,660 --> 05:20:34,500
I need you to hold fast till then.

4993
05:20:34,900 --> 05:20:38,000
This town is the bugs in the garden, and I can think of none better.

4994
05:20:38,760 --> 05:20:40,380
Very well, Hornet wielding needle.

4995
05:20:40,800 --> 05:20:41,840
A pact made strong.

4996
05:20:43,900 --> 05:20:46,040
I shall fight with Fates Renewed.

4997
05:20:48,240 --> 05:20:51,160
It's so hard to see sometimes when she's fighting.

4998
05:20:52,700 --> 05:20:54,720
Because it's like so much clutter.

4999
05:20:55,240 --> 05:20:55,600
You know?

5000
05:20:57,600 --> 05:21:00,840
It's so much fucking clutter on my screen when she's fighting.

5001
05:21:03,240 --> 05:21:03,620
Alright.

5002
05:21:03,860 --> 05:21:06,460
It is left and then left.

5003
05:21:11,590 --> 05:21:13,690
And then left and up.

5004
05:21:15,390 --> 05:21:16,470
Okay, yeah, this way.

5005
05:21:17,950 --> 05:21:18,990
What the fuck?

5006
05:21:19,330 --> 05:21:20,490
Okay, I could be here.

5007
05:21:22,830 --> 05:21:23,190
And up.

5008
05:21:23,430 --> 05:21:23,990
There we go.

5009
05:21:24,410 --> 05:21:25,370
And then there's the grave.

5010
05:21:26,550 --> 05:21:27,150
He polished.

5011
05:21:27,330 --> 05:21:28,330
You might be grieving.

5012
05:21:28,630 --> 05:21:29,470
What the fuck?

5013
05:21:32,230 --> 05:21:33,210
Oh my god.

5014
05:21:33,390 --> 05:21:35,490
I thought he was having a party with his friends.

5015
05:21:36,410 --> 05:21:38,210
I was like, oh hey, are you having a little party?

5016
05:21:43,630 --> 05:21:46,190
Okay, the boy hasn't taken him.

5017
05:21:46,230 --> 05:21:46,490
Oh, man.

5018
05:21:46,510 --> 05:21:46,970
took him.

5019
05:21:49,410 --> 05:21:51,850
Sorry, the boy, oh, it took her too, but it's fine.

5020
05:21:52,970 --> 05:21:53,350
Alright, they're dead.

5021
05:21:53,410 --> 05:21:54,270
Oh, they're not dead.

5022
05:21:55,050 --> 05:21:56,070
Are you serious?

5023
05:21:59,230 --> 05:22:01,210
Nice, I got it before the boy got him.

5024
05:22:03,270 --> 05:22:03,630
Friend!

5025
05:22:04,390 --> 05:22:05,230
There you go.

5026
05:22:05,750 --> 05:22:06,050
Hello!

5027
05:22:06,410 --> 05:22:07,630
I thought you was having a party.

5028
05:22:07,790 --> 05:22:08,610
I was like, hey, why?

5029
05:22:08,990 --> 05:22:13,790
Well, yo, what a frightful, fearful fright, you see poor Finn from such a delight.

5030
05:22:14,090 --> 05:22:17,870
At long his last to see that five-needle dance and sing.

5031
05:22:19,090 --> 05:22:21,610
These are deadly roads to wander, Pinmaster.

5032
05:22:22,250 --> 05:22:25,710
Especially with the black-soldier's soared threads tearing the lands apart.

5033
05:22:26,430 --> 05:22:29,650
Your greatest chance for safety lies in Bellheart with your fellows.

5034
05:22:30,110 --> 05:22:32,410
You can protect one another and perhaps in time rebuild.

5035
05:22:32,890 --> 05:22:34,310
Oh, yes, of course.

5036
05:22:34,690 --> 05:22:42,630
Twas not Pliny's wish to ban his dear bell friends, but with the world now ending, I had to come to say one last farewell to my sweet Melitola.

5037
05:22:42,990 --> 05:22:50,430
I should be returning though quite rightly our town will be needing a pin master's fine work now more than ever all right

5038
05:22:53,830 --> 05:23:05,530
i'm not talking to you sir that is not about you it's about that fast travel all right there you go stop stop singing it's not about you

5039
05:23:09,220 --> 05:23:49,400
all right i saved his life he should give it to he should like polish it for free like hypothetically speaking like that should be how it works this fortune see you return pinmaster the roads between here and that deep woods grave crawl with violent foals i concern for your safety brave warrior my hero twas indeed a fearful scrambled home i feel the corner be cantanically hot for bugs thank you for super chat i even think it's bro she's so skinny she's like a skeleton how would she be provide nutrients for the children with how skinny and sticky like stick bone she is.

5040
05:23:51,120 --> 05:23:58,720
Stick bugs are she could barely lift her whole she could barely lift her entire body with her fucking stick legs you not remember that?

5041
05:23:59,020 --> 05:24:01,880
She's like oh my mask is so heavy.

5042
05:24:02,900 --> 05:24:12,100
In such time the task for a pin master is clear the polish and sharpener are fine especially let the glimmer of your blade and may pierce through the encroaching murk.

5043
05:24:12,620 --> 05:24:12,620
Alright.

5044
05:24:13,220 --> 05:24:30,480
how much oh my god I'm nearly missing a hundred dollars I saved your life Jesus and all you could think about is money how about 680 rosaries

5045
05:24:35,060 --> 05:24:40,640
world may be ending but I literally saved his life and he was like money please

5046
05:24:44,070 --> 05:24:49,010
oh my god you're right and he raised his prices too That's so fucked up.

5047
05:24:49,490 --> 05:24:52,090
I saved his life and then he raised his prices.

5048
05:24:57,290 --> 05:24:59,910
Carly may el, but throughout it's more you need a little shine.

5049
05:25:00,050 --> 05:25:00,270
Yay!

5050
05:25:00,750 --> 05:25:02,110
Is that full upgrade, chat?

5051
05:25:04,890 --> 05:25:06,190
What's my new nail?

5052
05:25:07,550 --> 05:25:08,930
That's a full upgrade, right?

5053
05:25:13,520 --> 05:25:15,200
I don't know what's different with it.

5054
05:25:15,480 --> 05:25:17,220
I forgot what it looked like before.

5055
05:25:18,260 --> 05:25:18,740
Yeah!

5056
05:25:20,180 --> 05:25:22,700
I don't even remember what it looked like.

5057
05:25:23,020 --> 05:25:24,600
It was not paying attention.

5058
05:25:26,760 --> 05:25:27,700
You're like, look, it's full.

5059
05:25:27,780 --> 05:25:28,540
Look, it's different.

5060
05:25:28,640 --> 05:25:30,200
I was like, it's different?

5061
05:25:33,320 --> 05:25:36,680
All right, we're gonna call it here, guys.

5062
05:25:37,560 --> 05:25:38,680
Oh, it's a pretty boy killer.

5063
05:25:38,740 --> 05:25:39,460
They even super chat.

Thank you.

5065
05:25:39,780 --> 05:25:40,220
Thank you.

5066

Just finished act three yesterday and truly was worth the eight-year wait.

5067
05:25:43,280 --> 05:25:45,400
Can't wait to see you fight the final boss.

5068
05:25:45,880 --> 05:25:46,920

As always, everybody.

Stay hydrated.

5076
05:27:30,830 --> 05:27:31,430
Pause to check.

5077
05:27:31,710 --> 05:27:32,810
Get up and move around.

5078
05:27:32,930 --> 05:27:34,150
And get that blood flowing.

5079
05:27:34,310 --> 05:27:35,110
And stay up for me.

5080
05:27:35,130 --> 05:27:35,830
Head to bed.

Cause you deserve it.
