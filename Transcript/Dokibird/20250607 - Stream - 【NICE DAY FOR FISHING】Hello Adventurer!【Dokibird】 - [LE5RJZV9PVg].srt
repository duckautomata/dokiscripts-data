00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,890
Hello everybody!

2
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:33,990
Hello!

3
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,710
Hello!

4
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,250
Hello, adventurer!

5
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,510
Morning!

6
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,670
Nice day for fishing!

7
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,410
Sorry, I had to.

8
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,990
If I'm playing this game, I have to say it.

9
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,530
I have to say the thing.

10
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,510
Apparently, a lot of people were very surprised.

11
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:09,990
I don't know how people are surprised about it because, you know, I've talked about Viva La Dirt League for... Oh, am I a bit loud?

12
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:10,930
Oh, I'm sorry.

13
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,610
Am I?

14
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,110
Oh, I got really close to the mic.

15
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,890
That's my bad.

16
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,490
I got a little too close to the mic.

17
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,610
I should be better now.

18
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,650
Uh, louder.

19
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,730
No, no, guys.

20
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,450
Um, we have one more day with the, uh, with the scuff mic and the scuff setup.

21
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,150
And then we will be free.

22
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,710
We will be free.

23
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,010
Um, um, but yes, I actually, like, really like, uh, I've always liked their videos.

24
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:48,730
I've been watching them for, like, um, I think I've been watching them for, like, a year now, I'm pretty sure.

25
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,930
Um, a year plus now.

26
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,390
Actually, no.

27
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,130
Around a year and a half, I think.

28
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,610
Uh, I've been watching them for a year and a half.

29
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,690
I know it's not been that long.

30
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,930
Um, but...

31
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,370
Um, I enjoy their content.

32
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,710
And, um, I was super excited that, uh, about their game.

33
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,870
That they've been, like, you know, teasing for a long time.

34
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,190
And, oh, recent fat.

35
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,730
Okay, a year and a half is still a long time.

36
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,570
It's not like I...

37
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,490
Actually, no.

38
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,370
I think it's two years.

39
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:20,990
It's two years.

40
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,850
I've, like, lost sense of time.

41
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,070
I think it's two years.

42
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,830
It's definitely been two years, um, since I've been watching them.

43
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,230
Um, but, yeah.

44
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,390
I was really looking forward to playing their game.

45
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,930
Um, um, I wasn't planning on playing their new game that soon.

46
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,530
But then, you know, since I'm traveling right now, um, I feel like, you know, this is a great time.

47
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,790
Because it is a pixel game.

48
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,450
And I know, like, these types of games tend to be not very intensive.

49
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,590
So, I'll be like, okay, this is, um, this would be, you know, the perfect game to play while I'm traveling.

50
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,190
So, um, um, yeah.

51
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,030
I love their series.

52
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,910
I love all their... I think the only ones I don't, I tend to don't watch is Tech Town.

53
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,250
I don't watch Tech Town, but, like, I watch all the other series.

54
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,110
Because, like, um, I can't relate to Tech Town.

55
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,950
I'm sorry.

56
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,810
Um, I don't mean like that, but, um, I never had to do...

57
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,310
I never worked at GameStop.

58
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,030
So, I can't really...

59
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,030
Um, uh, but, like, it's not gaming.

60
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,050
Of course you don't.

61
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,670
Uh, you know, they're talking about technology and stuff like that.

62
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,810
Uh, that's why I can't... I can't relate to real-life Tom's Chipotle there.

63
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,950
But I like all their other series.

64
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,810
I... I haven't... I didn't watch...

65
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,670
I only watched, like, one or two episodes from Tech Town.

66
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,130
But I watched the other series.

67
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,910
I, you know, I think everybody...

68
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,210
Everyone loves NPC... The Adventures of NPC Man.

69
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,110
I think that one was... I think that one and the one where they...

70
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,070
Parody Blizzard HQ.

71
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,590
I... I enjoyed both.

72
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,590
Those were... Those two are my favorite series so far.

73
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,130
Um, I like that one.

74
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,870
I like, you know, The Adventures of Epic NPC Man.

75
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,570
And also the, uh, the Blizzard parody one is really good.

76
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,290
Uh...

77
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,590
Um, uh, so I like those two.

78
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,130
The D&D one was good, too.

79
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,890
I like the D&D one.

80
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,330
Even though I don't play Dungeons... I don't really play Dungeons and Dragons.

81
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,430
The D&D one was... Is really good.

82
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,290
I like anything Rowan... Rowan...

83
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,510
I love Rowan as a character because he always plays, like, the...

84
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,230
The dumb... The dumb doofus guy.

85
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,150
So...

86
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,610
So I can relate to him.

87
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,710
Uh...

88
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,370
Um...

89
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:42,470
Um...

90
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,510
Um...

91
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,010
But yeah, I figured this is a good one-off game to play while I'm traveling.

92
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,690
And, um...

93
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,790
Super excited to try it out.

94
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,530
They've been, like, teasing it for a long time.

95
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,790
I still can't believe yesterday my, uh, the internet died.

96
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,370
I...

97
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,610
I couldn't... Like, what are the chances?

98
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,690
I was actually...

99
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,690
We were all so happy yesterday when we finally got Delta Rune to run.

100
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,450
And then, like, the mo... I didn't even get to character creation.

101
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,910
I literally didn't even get to character creation mode.

102
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,470
And then the internet died.

103
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,490
And then it came back, like, uh...

104
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,950
I think it came back on, like, 15 minutes later.

105
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,530
And I was like, I... I'm whatever.

106
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,650
It's just like...

107
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,470
I was like, I can't believe it.

108
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,090
Like, the game...

109
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,570
Delta Rune really didn't want me to play it today.

110
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,270
Or yesterday.

111
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,770
The game really didn't want me to play.

112
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,950
You must.

113
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,550
And then the internet went out.

114
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,130
I was like, alright.

115
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,330
Fuck it.

116
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,250
I have played it.

117
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,670
I get to head to bed early, I guess.

118
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,130
Um...

119
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,810
Now, today's been a long day.

120
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,030
But it's nice.

121
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,170
We get to relax.

122
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,670
Um...

123
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,330
We get to relax with some fishing.

124
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:47,890
Um...

125
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,810
I forgot mostly about the lore of this...

126
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,210
Oh, hey.

127
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,470
It's a nice day for fishing.

128
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,110
Ha-ha.

129
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,590
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

130
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,730
No, the internet actually died.

131
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,590
And then I ended stream because the internet died.

132
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,850
Welcome to the world of Azrim.

133
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,670
A harsh world of magic.

134
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,610
Monsters, heroes, and adventures.

135
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,050
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

136
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,620
This is Balin, the fisherman.

137
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,120
He's one of the many NPCs of the town of Honeywood.

138
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,770
Let's follow Balin and meet some of the other Honeywood NPCs.

139
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,490
Alright.

140
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,080
Welcome to Honeywood.

141
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,440
A simple town in Azrim where players start their journeys as adventurers.

142
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Along with all the brave adventurers, Honeywood is also inhabited by his very own town's folks, the NPCs.

143
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,440
Willing to sell sword.

144
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,620
Take Greg, the garlic.

145
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,740
Oh my god, it's Greg!

146
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,100
The garlic farmer.

147
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,340
For example, he is the main quest giver of Honeywood.

148
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,000
Which is actually kind of weird because he's literally just a garlic farmer.

149
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,360
And honestly, he gets way too much attention.

150
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,780
I know, he's just there.

151
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,750
Welcome to the town.

152
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,130
There's a...

153
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:21,310
Oh!

154
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,130
It's the skip guy!

155
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,510
That's me as here.

156
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,470
This is why I don't play.

157
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,230
Oh my god, it's my man, Greg.

158
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,110
Well, that was rude.

159
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,790
While guest heroes have much more important things to do than hear about my problems.

160
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,270
Morning.

161
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,390
Morning.

162
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,050
Hey, Balin.

163
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,370
Nice day for fishing, ain't it?

164
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,630
It sure is, Balin.

165
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,370
I think this is more so, like, people who watch their videos.

166
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,790
Like, because there's so many, like, inside jokes from their videos.

167
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,450
And there's Bulger, the blacksmith.

168
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,150
How else would adventurers get...

169
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,630
Oh my god, this is the one time you see Balin and Bulger together in the same...

170
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,930
In the same room.

171
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,470
Because it's pixel art.

172
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,710
The blacksmith.

173
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,130
How else would adventurers get the finest weapons and armor needed to face the many dangers of Azerim.

174
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,990
The reason why I say that is because they're both played by the same actor.

175
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,410
See, it's the same guy.

176
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,130
It's literally the same guy.

177
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,270
You handsome W.

178
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,610
The U.

179
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,570
Yeah, just like every other time you mention it.

180
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,390
Alright, what's this?

181
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,510
Oh, it's the guy.

182
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,290
It's that guy.

183
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,370
The main guy.

184
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,170
The hero.

185
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,770
Once adventurers have done enough crappy low-level quests, they get to meet me.

186
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,650
Hi, Sorcerer Baradun.

187
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:53,490
I start them on the main campaign, where they're trying to become the hero of Azerim.

188
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,030
Ha-ha!

189
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,110
Alright, look at me for...

190
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,590
Morning.

191
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,390
The world needs you, adventurer.

192
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,830
Greetings, Balin.

193
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,670
I'm currently working on a heroic story about my heroic deeds.

194
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,190
It's very heroic.

195
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,830
Here, let me show you something.

196
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:11,750
That's a bit efficient, ain't it?

197
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,950
Yes, Balin.

198
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,750
Behold, the chest of abandoned souls.

199
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,670
It's a very dangerous relic.

200
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,590
Only a mighty sorcerer like me can handle it.

201
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,470
Let me tell you the story about this relic.

202
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,450
Who you...

203
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,890
Did you know they took...

204
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,410
I know, right?

205
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,730
They took Adam's likeness for this.

206
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,730
Oh my god.

207
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,170
Hey, Bernard, lift me higher.

208
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,230
Do you see that sorcerer guy with the shiny thingy?

209
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,870
Yeah, Charles.

210
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,010
It sounds really expensive.

211
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,490
Let's go mug him.

212
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,330
Okay, if people look very similar, um...

213
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:55,370
In the show, in the YouTube videos, there's only six actors.

214
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,870
Wait, no.

215
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,630
Five.

216
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,330
There's only five actors.

217
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,730
And they all...

218
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,110
They all populate the town.

219
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,150
This town.

220
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,730
So, Bernard is also the same actor.

221
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,950
That's the third Rowan.

222
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,790
It's also the same actor, um, as the other two guys.

223
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:28,070
So, like, my favorite is that it's, like, it's, like, they do this thing where it's, like, the Amy, the Amy thing.

224
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,290
The token Amy.

225
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,270
So, like, the...

226
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,650
Okay, sometimes they have two female actresses.

227
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,330
But then it's usually just one female actress in the...

228
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,390
In the acting group.

229
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,170
So, it's, like, four guys and one female actress.

230
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:45,930
Sometimes...

231
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,870
Sometimes there's two.

232
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,290
Five guys and they're...

233
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,810
Four guys and they're clones.

234
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,890
Bernard, he said it's really dangerous.

235
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,690
Oh, yeah.

236
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,650
I heard that.

237
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,770
Really dangerous.

238
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,350
Let's go mug him.

239
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,310
Bernard, he said only a sorcerer can handle it.

240
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,910
Hey, what are we?

241
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,610
Oh, well, we're...

242
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,670
We're muggers.

243
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,570
Yeah?

244
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,430
And what do muggers do?

245
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,390
Well, they mug people.

246
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,570
So, let's go mug him.

247
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,790
Oh, my God.

248
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,930
He's mugging him.

249
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,380
What have you done?

250
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,300
You fools.

251
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,380
Nobody was supposed to touch this.

252
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
Wait, what have we done, Bernard?

253
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,460
Let's get out of here.

254
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,220
Oh, my God.

255
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,920
They're mugging.

256
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,160
Oh, my God.

257
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,660
Wait.

258
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,660
What is this?

259
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,820
There's something inside the chest.

260
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,680
It looks like some kind of ancient scroll.

261
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,100
Written by the creators of the world.

262
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,080
Oh, this is really bad.

263
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh, wait.

264
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,200
I just remembered.

265
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,080
I left that oven on.

266
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,260
Portal away.

267
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,260
Goodbye.

268
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,440
Oh, connection lost.

269
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,520
Oh, my God.

270
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,560
The real players.

271
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,400
We destroyed the server.

272
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,280
Wait.

273
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,700
Who's going to save Honeywood?

274
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,470
I'm here.

275
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,190
Oh, my God.

276
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,110
I'm going to be the adventurer now.

277
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,310
The server is dying.

278
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,450
Oh, I'm a player.

279
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:40,850
Hello.

280
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,530
I'm Balin.

281
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,090
Morning.

282
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,670
Morning.

283
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,590
Nice day for fishing.

284
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,590
Are you okay, Balin?

285
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,370
You look kind of different.

286
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,910
Greg, what on earth did you do?

287
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,990
You seem kind of heroic.

288
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,390
Almost like an adventurer.

289
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,230
Speaking of which, have you seen any of them around?

290
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,030
They all seem to be gone.

291
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,510
Why are all the adventurers gone again?

292
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,770
Did you do something, Greg?

293
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,270
Well, at least we have some peace and quiet for now.

294
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,610
Hey, Balin.

295
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,550
Come here for a sec.

296
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,830
I'm sure it's your fault.

297
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,930
Balin, did you hear me?

298
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,070
Come here for a sec.

299
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,810
Okay, now I can walk.

300
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,070
Morning.

301
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,290
Wait, I can't go here?

302
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,050
It's not fair.

303
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,690
Alright.

304
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,530
You notice how quiet it is today?

305
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,850
I'm sure some adventurers are on the help of my quest.

306
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,270
I need someone to collect three garlics for me.

307
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,850
Did you just accept my quest?

308
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,370
How is that possible?

309
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,290
Do I just say morning?

310
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,270
Look at that garlic film.

311
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,730
I made them sparkle so that even the dumbest adventurer knows how that they have to collect them.

312
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:00,590
Okay.

313
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,590
So help Greg collect some garlic.

314
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,070
Okay.

315
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,950
Alright, here you go, Greg.

316
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,370
I got you the garlic.

317
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,410
How are you able to do my quest?

318
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,510
This is incredible!

319
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,270
Normally, only mighty adventurers can do them.

320
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,870
Guys, I watched too much Viva La Dirt.

321
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:31,570
I know exactly, like, you could tell that I have, I got there, like, like, the way they talk, the intonations of how they talk down because I watched too much.

322
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,190
Speaking of adventurers, where have they all gone?

323
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,310
This is getting weird.

324
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,490
Ah, well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

325
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,570
On the bright side, I guess this means we have some spare time, right?

326
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,310
Hmm.

327
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,830
Since there's no adventurers around, I wonder if you could help me with something.

328
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,610
I need some fish for dinner, and you're obviously the perfect man for the job.

329
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,250
By the way, here's a small reward for you.

330
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:57,750
Yay!

331
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:03,370
He gave me the three garlic that I gave him.

332
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,550
Yay!

333
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,070
Okay, I can't go that way yet.

334
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,550
No fish yet?

335
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,170
Oh, I have to use the garlic as bait?

336
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,670
Okay.

337
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,830
Can I steal more?

338
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,130
Okay, I can steal more of his garlic.

339
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:13,930
Nice.

340
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:14,870
You don't need it.

341
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,990
Your whole job is to farm.

342
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:17,750
Okay.

343
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,750
All right, now I can finally play my fishing game.

344
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,450
You can move the hook up and down.

345
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:23,970
Okay.

346
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,790
All right.

347
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,310
So, I just do that.

348
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,830
Oh, I can't move it too far.

349
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,190
Okay.

350
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:32,890
Come on.

351
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,430
Come on.

352
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,230
Okay, nice.

353
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,430
Okay.

354
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,190
Oh, I attack by...

355
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,510
I attack by fishing.

356
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,390
All right.

357
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,230
The weakest fish in Honeywood.

358
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,750
Even the lowliest adventurers have caught this fish at some point.

359
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,270
Yay!

360
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,210
A fish caught.

361
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:54,410
Finally.

362
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,650
A game for me.

363
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,010
All right.

364
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,150
I think it doesn't go too low.

365
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,450
So, I'm gonna catch this fish too.

366
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:03,590
Okay.

367
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,130
How many...

368
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,770
How many...

369
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,450
How many did Greg want?

370
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,050
I already forgot how many he wanted.

371
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,190
Greg, how many did you want?

372
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,870
One, thank you for the garlic, Greg.

373
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,390
There you go.

374
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,890
Hello, adventurer.

375
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,310
Great catch, Balan.

376
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,390
Thank you for the fish.

377
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,730
Well, with no adventurers around, I can't give out any quests.

378
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,110
I guess I'm just gonna take it easy today.

379
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,470
Maybe you can use the free time to upgrade your fishing rod.

380
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,390
A longer fishing line will help you catch better fish.

381
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,710
Look, I skipped dialogue.

382
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,570
Just like the other adventurers.

383
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,010
Ask Boger the blacksmith.

384
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,190
He's a pretty bad blacksmith, but he always has a ton of crap laying around.

385
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,850
I'm sure he can make a longer line for you.

386
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,290
And here, take some more garlic as a reward for the fish.

387
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,110
I have plenty.

388
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,590
Okay, I can literally steal his garlic right here.

389
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,910
I'll need you to give me garlic, Greg.

390
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:55,950
Skip.

391
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,810
Hey, Balan.

392
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,410
My friend, how can good old Boger help you?

393
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,890
Ah, it looks like your fishing rod needs an upgrade.

394
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,830
It's just a bent stick with a ball of shooting attached.

395
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,470
It's a miracle you can catch anything with this.

396
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,770
Well, you're in luck.

397
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,250
I have a better fishing line I can spare.

398
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,670
But first, you have to do me a favor.

399
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,430
That's how being an adventurer goes, I'm afraid.

400
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,070
Gotta do a quest for me.

401
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:26,710
I was out getting supplies, and when I returned, I noticed that my grandfather's hammer was missing.

402
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,230
Can you help me find it?

403
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,730
An adventurer told me it's in the town well to the east.

404
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,210
But I can't leave my smithy unattended.

405
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,370
If you bring me my hammer, then the new fishing line is all yours.

406
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,810
Alright, I gotta open my map.

407
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,790
Alright, where is it?

408
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,410
It's like right there.

409
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,110
It's not that far.

410
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:46,470
I don't know.

411
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,570
Do you want to find my fish?

412
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,150
Oh my god, it's Fred!

413
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,550
Doki put so much work in his dialogue, practiced it again and again, and you're gonna skip it?

414
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,650
That's so- I didn't skip it!

415
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,290
I actually paid attention!

416
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,030
Bala would never.

417
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,930
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

418
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,970
Thank you, thank you.

419
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,710
Feel free to browse my rice.

420
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,130
Oh, I guess I can afford to buy things from you if I sell one of my children first.

421
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,950
Alright, buy my fish.

422
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,710
Alright, nice.

423
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:14,870
Alright.

424
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,490
Oh, hey!

425
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,450
It's Eugene!

426
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:17,910
Oh!

427
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,210
Oh, it's this guy!

428
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,930
I need- I need a brain bureau to help me, but there are no adventures nearby!

429
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,330
Oh, it's the- Oh, it's this guy!

430
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,870
I know him.

431
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,450
I like how it's just all, like, inside jokes.

432
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,190
Please do not fish this side, Mr. Oh, okay.

433
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,630
I'm gonna fish in the well.

434
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,230
Oh, it's a hammer!

435
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:41,950
Nice.

436
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,030
Cry.

437
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:50,610
Cry.

438
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:51,650
W.A.B.

439
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,210
Skip-a-skip-a.

440
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,610
I wonder if there's an Easter egg if I just keep skipping him.

441
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,110
Oh, hello, Balan.

442
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:58,950
Alright.

443
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,750
Hey, you found my grandfather's hammer!

444
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,430
You have no idea how much this means to me.

445
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,370
Let me tell you a little story.

446
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,070
This hammer- Skip, skip.

447
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,570
Alright.

448
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,910
It's finished.

449
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,150
Why don't you give the new line a try?

450
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,610
Oh, nice!

451
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,970
Oh, I got the Honeywood line.

452
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,330
Alright, skipping that was okay.

453
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,050
The world needs you, adventurer.

454
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:31,550
I, High Sorcerer, Baradin, have come from the Temple of Calibor to send you a message and...

455
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,790
Wait, Balan?

456
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,270
I thought you were an adventurer.

457
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,710
Huh.

458
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,570
That's so weird.

459
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,850
Why did I think you were an adventurer?

460
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,490
Speaking of which, where did they all go?

461
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,930
Yeah, I need the bucket, guys.

462
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:53,510
Normally, I would now explain the main quest and go on an epic journey with an adventurer.

463
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,170
Not a lowly, peasant fisherman.

464
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,350
No offense.

465
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,510
Hmm, you know what?

466
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,430
Maybe you can be useful after all.

467
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:10,230
You see, there's a mysterious fish at the bottom of the Honeywood pond that I've always wanted to examine.

468
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:18,950
Normally, I would give an adventurer this quest, but since there aren't any adventurers around, maybe you can catch the mysterious fish.

469
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,510
So what do you say?

470
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,630
Could you do me a favor and catch a fish?

471
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,550
Huh-huh.

472
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,190
Morning.

473
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,090
Nice day for fishing.

474
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:28,330
Alright.

475
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,730
Okay, I did not want the fucking Honeywood Aaron to try and catch this one.

476
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,910
Okay, I need him out of here.

477
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:37,670
Alright.

478
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,010
Alright, let's see.

479
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,070
Oh, yeah!

480
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,690
Level up!

481
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,130
Nice!

482
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,790
Wait, am I gonna have to fight?

483
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,130
Wait, this is a fishing game.

484
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,510
What do you mean fight?

485
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,230
Oh my god.

486
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,070
Get out!

487
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,410
I...

488
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,470
Get out of here!

489
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,110
Okay.

490
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,610
Okay, this...

491
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,390
This tap.

492
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,970
Okay, there we go.

493
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:58,570
There we go.

494
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,790
That's much better.

495
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:00,630
Alright.

496
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,570
Yeah, I was gonna say.

497
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,730
I thought I'm fishing.

498
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,290
What do I need defense for?

499
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,550
Are they gonna fight back?

500
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,050
Whoa!

501
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,350
Whoa!

502
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,010
What the...

503
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,210
Whoa!

504
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,840
Guys, they fought back.

505
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,860
They...

506
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,380
Guys, they fought back.

507
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
Yes, apparently.

508
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,040
Apparently.

509
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,380
Okay.

510
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,300
How the fuck was that?

511
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,100
Ow.

512
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:27,920
Ow.

513
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,020
Oh my god.

514
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,400
Wait, how do I...

515
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,600
Do I not fight him when he does that?

516
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,020
Okay.

517
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,460
Okay.

518
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:33,820
Wait.

519
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,120
They did.

520
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,180
Fought back.

521
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,660
Okay, I have an idea.

522
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,840
Oh, okay.

523
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,340
Okay.

524
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,280
That's...

525
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,600
Oh, oh, okay.

526
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,740
Okay, I figured it out.

527
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,180
I figured it out.

528
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,320
Okay.

529
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,580
Okay, there we go.

530
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,240
There we go.

531
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,380
Yay!

532
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,600
But we all know she skips and she can't read.

533
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,980
I still love my alert.

534
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,920
Oh, she...

535
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,540
Not so dead, but thank you for the super chat.

536
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,640
Thank you, thank you.

537
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,860
Warren, thank you for the super chat.

538
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,760
Thank you, thank you.

539
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,180
Dookie, in order to save the world, you must skip a skip up.

540
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,280
Thank you for the super chat.

541
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,860
Thank you, thank you.

542
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,980
Guys, I skipped too much, guys.

543
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,240
Guys, all it took was you to read.

544
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,860
I'm sorry, I was skipping the dialogue.

545
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,200
Alright.

546
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,060
Nice.

547
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,440
Alright.

548
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,980
Yoink, my garlic.

549
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,520
Wow, that is an ugly fish.

550
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,320
It makes sense since it came from this ugly shithole of a town.

551
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,680
But this fish is no orderling fish.

552
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,260
There seems there's something trapped inside of it.

553
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,500
Some kind of evil?

554
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,000
I wonder what would happen if I'd use a spell on it.

555
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,620
I don't think you should... Oops.

556
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,860
What happened?

557
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,540
Oh.

558
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,520
Wait, what the fuck?

559
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,880
It's Squidman.

560
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,740
I am the Dark Lord, he's howling.

561
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,740
I am darkness and conrad.

562
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,600
I am the lord of the depths of the sea.

563
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,560
Who dares to awaken me?

564
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,360
I was sealed at the bottom of this foul pond for thousands of years.

565
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,500
But I am finally free once more.

566
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,560
Behold my powers!

567
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,340
For I will destroy this pitiful village right before I conquer all of Azerim.

568
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,480
Bro, I was just trying to fish, bro.

569
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,520
Oh no!

570
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,080
Adventurer!

571
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,380
You must save Honeywood!

572
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,020
Um... Adventurers?

573
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,320
Huh?

574
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,460
Huh?

575
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,420
What's that?

576
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,780
No adventurer attacking me?

577
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,420
Well, yeah.

578
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,440
Normally the adventurers will fight you now and save the village, I guess.

579
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,040
But, they're all gone.

580
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,160
We just have Balin, the fisherman.

581
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,920
Hmm...

582
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,900
Okay, but Balin is surprisingly incredibly strong though.

583
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,140
And you piss him off.

584
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,400
Well, in that case...

585
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,420
This is my chance to conquer Azerim for good!

586
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,560
Mwahaha!

587
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,420
Balin, quick!

588
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,040
Use your new adventurer powers!

589
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,600
Let me challenge you to a fishing contest!

590
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,600
What are you doing?

591
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,880
I'm trying to fish, bro!

592
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,700
Enough of this!

593
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,480
You are far too weak to stop me!

594
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,760
Now witness my power!

595
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,100
Can I, like, romance him?

596
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,700
Like...

597
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,600
Uh, like that other...

598
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,140
Hahahaha!

599
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,400
And as promised, I will destroy this puny village!

600
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,020
What?

601
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,700
You can do it in the other game?

602
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,460
Why can't I do it in this game?

603
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,820
Hahahaha!

604
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,720
Balin?

605
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,060
Balin, are you awake?

606
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,400
Oh no!

607
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,020
The town of Honeywood!

608
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,000
Okay, but, like, this town is a shithole, so like...

609
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,120
It's not like we lost anything.

610
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,940
It's literally level one village.

611
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,780
The town is destroyed, and there's still no sound of any ventures out!

612
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,160
Baradun fought the evil sea monster guy in an epic battle!

613
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,920
Unfortunately, you were unconscious, so you didn't witness it.

614
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,400
Man, it was so epic!

615
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,820
Also, this is a long-ass server maintenance.

616
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,340
Doki-do!

617
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,820
It's an iconic landmark!

618
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,560
After destroying our village, the creature escaped with Baradun hot on his tail!

619
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,400
It was such an incredible fight!

620
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,320
Spells, evil magic, fireballs!

621
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,660
You really missed an incredible show!

622
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,840
Pity you were in a fade to black!

623
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,660
Honeywood is in ruins!

624
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,940
Please, search for survivors, Balin!

625
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,800
I'll stay here!

626
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,960
Alright, let me steal some...

627
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,760
Balin, now is not the time for fishing!

628
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,960
But it's always time for fishing!

629
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,020
Okay, I'm still gonna steal your garlic.

630
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,180
Greg...

631
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,760
I can't believe he would say that!

632
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,640
It's always time for fishing!

633
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,000
Every day is a nice day to fish!

634
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,180
Please help me, Balin!

635
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,080
I've been badly injured!

636
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,460
Talk to Greg!

637
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,040
He'll know what to do!

638
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,820
Alright...

639
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,480
Oh, hello, Balin!

640
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,340
Oh, you found Frey?

641
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,960
Poor guy looks injured!

642
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,680
This extra strong garlic will help him get him back on his feet!

643
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,300
Please!

644
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,100
Give it to him!

645
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,360
Alright, here's the garlic!

646
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:24,860
Hello!

647
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,580
Oh, you're back?

648
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,720
Did Greg have anything to help me?

649
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:29,860
Whoa!

650
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,980
This garlic is so strong!

651
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,780
I feel much better!

652
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,640
Thanks for your help, Balin!

653
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,080
Okay, I just realized, guys...

654
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,180
Okay...

655
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,480
I need to...

656
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,940
My phone was never charged.

657
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,500
Is it charged now?

658
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:48,880
Ha!

659
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,840
Okay, I think...

660
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
I assume it'll be charged...

661
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,940
It'll be awkward if it isn't.

662
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:54,940
Uh...

663
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,640
Sadly, all my stuff is destroyed!

664
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,300
I have to start my business from scratch again!

665
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,780
Maybe you can help me!

666
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,500
If you bring me some fish, I'll buy them from you!

667
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,300
By the way, I saw a booger searching for something at the well!

668
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,800
You sure could talk to him!

669
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,380
Oh, nice!

670
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,480
Wait, I got a friend!

671
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,320
Is he gonna follow me?

672
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,080
Wait, what?

673
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,740
Hahaha!

674
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,360
How do you got a person as a reward?

675
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,840
Alright, I'll sell another fish.

676
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,560
Ooh, wait!

677
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,020
This fish is better than the other fish.

678
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,220
Okay, it's one dollar.

679
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,100
I'm not giving you my fish, friend.

680
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,160
Someone else would appreciate my fish.

681
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,400
Oh, wait, is there something here?

682
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,380
Hey, Balin!

683
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:31,860
Hey!

684
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,380
Did you see that horrible sea creature?

685
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,140
The beacons of Miramar have been lit, but no adventurers are coming to our aid.

686
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,160
Hey!

687
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,640
Why do you sound more feminine when forcing men?

688
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,320
What do you mean?

689
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,160
Let me double check my phone real quick.

690
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,000
Okay, it says it's charging, but I don't know why.

691
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,680
It's like, it's like on and off.

692
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,460
Alright.

693
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,460
Hahaha!

694
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,460
Thank you for the super chat!

695
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,420
Thank you, thank you!

696
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,520
Honey, where did my shop have been destroyed?

697
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,860
During the chaos of destruction, my grandfather's hammer was blasted away.

698
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,260
Can you help me find it?

699
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,420
Okay, but that's just Greg, guys.

700
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,420
That's not me.

701
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,820
That's just Greg.

702
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,480
Guys, Greg sounds like that.

703
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,660
Okay.

704
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,700
For the peace of the ca- Oh, hey, that's me again!

705
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,380
Wait, no, is that- No, that's not me.

706
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,840
That's the other guy.

707
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,600
The blonde guy.

708
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,360
Alright.

709
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,540
Can I jump?

710
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,600
I can't- I don't know how to jump yet.

711
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,420
Where's your hammer?

712
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,460
Oh, it's back- Wait, where is your hammer?

713
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,940
I don't know where the fuck your- Oh, wait.

714
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,560
I don't know where the fuck your hammer is.

715
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,520
Is it back in here?

716
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,800
Oh my god, it's back in here.

717
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,640
Okay, here you go.

718
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,880
Here you go, booger.

719
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,780
My grandfather's hammer!

720
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,700
What would I do without it?

721
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,080
Oh, so Meep, thank you for 10 gifted ships!

722
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,100
Thank you, thank you!

723
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,080
It's- Is that also Rowan?

724
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,300
There's so many Rowans.

725
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,500
I- What would I do without it?

726
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,580
But did you know this hammer is rightfully mine?

727
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,100
It was given to me rightfully by my grandfather.

728
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,240
This hammer has been in my family for generations, and is rightfully mine.

729
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,120
I vowed to never lose it ever again.

730
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,100
But for now, we need a plan.

731
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,320
We should talk to Greg.

732
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,300
Let's go!

733
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,040
Nice!

734
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,900
I got a- Nice, I have- I have booger.

735
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,120
Nice.

736
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,700
Alright, Greg.

737
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,080
I got them all back.

738
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,100
Hello, adventurer!

739
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,800
You found a booger?

740
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,100
I was a little worried, but don't tell him that.

741
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,440
Anyway, honey, we sure could use your help, Balen.

742
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,020
Everyone looks pretty bad beat up.

743
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,980
You can catch some fish to feed people.

744
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,480
I'm sure everyone will be very grateful.

745
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,840
Okay, I just need one more fish.

746
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,460
Finally!

747
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,640
The real game.

748
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,920
Yoink my garlic.

749
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,460
Alright, finally, I can actually play my favorite part of this game.

750
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,380
Fishing!

751
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,640
Alright.

752
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,000
Hello, fishies.

753
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,140
Alright.

754
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,600
Hello!

755
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,400
Okay, so when they turn around, I just need to make sure I don't do anything.

756
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:07,940
Yay!

757
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,280
Alright.

758
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,020
I level up!

759
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Alright, nice.

760
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,460
It's such a nice day for fishing, guys.

761
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,500
Hey!

762
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,600
You caught some fish!

763
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,380
With everything destroyed, this fish will help keep people fed.

764
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,380
You saved our lives, Balen!

765
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,580
It's a small reward.

766
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,480
The town's folks put together say thanks.

767
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,560
Now we can plan our next step.

768
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,620
Talk to me when you're ready.

769
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,500
Oh, nice.

770
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,780
I have five gold coins.

771
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,280
A whole five gold coins.

772
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:35,860
Let's go.

773
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,840
Yoink my garlic.

774
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,640
Hey, Balen.

775
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,260
I've been thinking about the evil fish monster thing that destroyed Honeywood.

776
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,240
If only no more, we probably need to speak with High Sorcerer Baroden.

777
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,180
Ugh.

778
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,000
Baroden followed that creature across the lake.

779
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,520
We need to get you over there.

780
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,200
But how?

781
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,020
How are you gonna feed- Okay, they have three- This village has three people.

782
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,840
I think the crying guy died.

783
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,220
So like, that's alright.

784
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,520
One less mouth to feed.

785
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,580
So three people, three fishes.

786
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,560
Hmm.

787
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,520
If I have enough supplies, I could probably craft a boat for you.

788
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,140
If you bring me five bits of scrap wood, that should be enough to craft a boat.

789
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,400
Come back with the scrap wood and we can plan our next step.

790
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,660
I mean, what happened to cry.wav guy?

791
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,760
Oh, nice.

792
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,400
I got scrap wood.

793
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,020
Oh, okay.

794
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,220
This is scrap wood.

795
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,580
Okay.

796
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,880
It's just lying there.

797
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,460
It's part of the destroyed village.

798
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,400
Uh, what about- Okay, but like, he's not part of the village though.

799
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,820
He's just there.

800
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,340
No, not him.

801
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,940
That's Fred.

802
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,820
The crying guy used to be here, but I think he's dead now.

803
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,180
I- Hahaha!

804
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,420
Fuck!

805
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,040
That should be enough.

806
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,180
Fred and I also found some fabric for the sale.

807
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,280
Give this a boat and finish the crafting.

808
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,360
Yeah, that's enough supplies.

809
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,700
Now, to build a boat.

810
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,580
No more- Yeah, Eugene's dead, I'm pretty sure.

811
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,240
Rest in peace Eugene, I think.

812
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,660
It's finished.

813
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,020
A true masterpiece of craftsmanship.

814
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,800
You can thank me and my good ol' hammer.

815
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,020
Which is rightfully mine.

816
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
No more crying.

817
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,260
W-A-B.

818
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,840
The boat is ready for you, Balan.

819
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,200
Search for Baranun.

820
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,100
To the west.

821
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,780
Meanwhile, we'll continue our work here in Honeywood.

822
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,680
Good luck!

823
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,800
Nice!

824
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,680
I got a boat.

825
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,340
Okay.

826
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,040
And let me pick up some more garlic.

827
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:30,920
Yoink.

828
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,160
Alright.

829
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,700
Here I'll go.

830
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,320
On my boat- Oh, wait!

831
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,040
I must be able to fish the chest, right?

832
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,380
Okay, I need to...

833
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,620
Go back a little.

834
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,020
Okay.

835
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,320
Oh, I have to like gauge the distance for this.

836
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,000
Wait, what?

837
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,580
Okay, let me just beat up this bass then.

838
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,240
Don't you dare look away.

839
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,500
Oh, oh!

840
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:51,940
Oh!

841
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,180
Okay.

842
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,340
Okay.

843
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,940
Come on, look at me!

844
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,780
Look at me!

845
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,820
Alright, nice.

846
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,100
Alright.

847
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,920
I wanna fish this chest.

848
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,740
Come on.

849
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,180
Okay, I need to be a bit closer.

850
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,940
Oh, I can't.

851
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,280
Okay, I can't pick it up.

852
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,280
Aww.

853
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,920
Yeah, this is based on the YouTube series.

854
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,100
They made a new game.

855
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,500
Wait, did I caught this before?

856
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,500
No, he's big.

857
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,520
He's a big boy!

858
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,560
Ooh!

859
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,800
Oh, wait.

860
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,060
Attacking the enemy raises his rage, charging up its spell.

861
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,600
Oh, shit.

862
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,820
Okay, he's angry.

863
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,380
Don't worry.

864
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,340
Okay.

865
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,440
It's not...

866
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,340
It's just 5 HP.

867
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,100
That's 5.

868
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,060
Alright.

869
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,780
Don't be angry.

870
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,300
Don't be angry.

871
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,060
Come on!

872
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:38,720
Oh!

873
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,740
Oh, never mind.

874
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,300
Okay.

875
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,020
I'm too weak for this fish.

876
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,900
I know, right?

877
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,420
What the fuck did fish in as we're able to do magic?

878
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,300
I wonder if I can grab that chest, though.

879
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,000
Wait.

880
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,840
This fish looks scary.

881
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,220
Oh, I can't.

882
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,880
Wait, what?

883
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,940
Oh, he hates that.

884
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,020
He's a picky fish.

885
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,980
Couple less chests.

886
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,600
Okay.

887
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,840
I need to be a little bit further away.

888
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,980
Alright, here we go.

889
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,980
Yeah, he's a picky eater.

890
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,620
I can't believe he doesn't like garlic!

891
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,280
This is from the finest...

892
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,200
The finest garlic in all of Honeywood.

893
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,440
The shit village.

894
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,880
Okay, the common carp.

895
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,960
If I know anything about carp in Animal Crossing, is that this is a shitty fish.

896
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,020
Okay.

897
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,280
Okay.

898
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,400
Come on.

899
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,320
Oh my god, he does so much damage.

900
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,060
Are you serious?!

901
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,460
8 HP?!

902
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,340
Oh...

903
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,140
Oh my god.

904
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,740
Okay, he's dead.

905
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,540
Okay, never mind.

906
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,420
I don't think I'm strong enough for him.

907
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,940
I have to do a base.

908
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,220
A bass fish.

909
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,260
What was the Animal Crossing saying when you catch a bass fish?

910
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:52,910
Come on.

911
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:53,950
Eat my...

912
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,550
Eat this.

913
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,310
Eat this.

914
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,750
He just died.

915
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,770
He like actually just disappeared.

916
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,530
Oh!

917
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,070
Wait, I don't think I can block.

918
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,010
Yeah, I can't block guys.

919
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,290
I don't have that ability yet.

920
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,370
Okay.

921
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,750
Alright, nice.

922
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,150
Oh!

923
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,410
I have a big guy.

924
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,280
Alright.

925
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,180
Hello.

926
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,140
Hello.

927
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,960
I have five dollars.

928
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,660
Hello, Baradun.

929
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,420
Fisherman.

930
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,440
Baradun, what brings you over the side of the lake?

931
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,620
You missed my epic fight with the evil fish monster guy.

932
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,160
What was his name again?

933
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,900
Ah, the dark lord is Halden.

934
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,460
I was so badass.

935
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,720
But due to the budget cuts, you just couldn't see it because we can't afford the CGI.

936
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,580
But just as I was winning, he managed to escape and now my mana is depleted.

937
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,800
Maybe he can help me by catching a fresh fish.

938
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,240
I heard the basic bass are delicious.

939
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,040
This is also the perfect opportunity to train blocking.

940
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,040
Oh, now I can block.

941
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,880
Simply hold B to block enemy attacks.

942
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,260
Can you catch some bass for me?

943
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,340
And try to block the attacks a few times.

944
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,780
Okay, now I can block guys.

945
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,620
I learned how to block.

946
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,740
Okay, where's the bass fish area?

947
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:22,660
Okay.

948
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,560
Okay.

949
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:24,780
And then...

950
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,040
Okay.

951
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,620
I'm blocking.

952
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:28,840
Okay.

953
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,740
Oh, I have to hold it.

954
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,440
Okay, I'm clearly... I don't...

955
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,200
I was trying to perfect parry it.

956
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,540
There we go.

957
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,320
I was trying to perfect parry it for some fucking reason.

958
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,480
I was trying to be so smart.

959
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,100
Oh, no.

960
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,600
Oh, no.

961
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,640
No, no, no, no, no!

962
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,680
He was one!

963
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,100
I'm so sad.

964
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,760
Oh, my God.

965
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,080
Okay, I can swim over here.

966
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,220
Come on.

967
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,640
Eat this.

968
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,600
Eat this garlic.

969
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,620
Okay, now I know.

970
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,760
I know now, guys.

971
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,300
Okay.

972
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,540
I know now.

973
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,560
You can't perfect parry.

974
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,560
Oh, wait!

975
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,380
That's not a bass!

976
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:13,820
Whoops!

977
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,400
Whoops.

978
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,080
Okay, I never got catch a...

979
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,280
I already have a bass though.

980
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,780
Okay, but I'm catching them in advance, guys.

981
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
I'm catching him in advance.

982
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:26,660
Nice.

983
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,080
Alright.

984
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,360
I already...

985
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,460
Okay, I need one more...

986
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,420
The orange guy right here.

987
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,960
Okay, I fucked up.

988
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,260
I forgot to have range.

989
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,840
Okay, here you go.

990
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,680
Nice.

991
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,380
Okay, I feel like I don't need to...

992
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,100
I don't need to block this guy.

993
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,120
He doesn't do that much damage.

994
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,060
Look at him.

995
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,080
He's so fucking weak.

996
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:50,720
Okay.

997
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,400
Come on.

998
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,020
Get over here.

999
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:52,740
Yay!

1000
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,220
Ooh!

1001
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,080
Another new record.

1002
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:55,660
Nice.

1003
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,400
Alright.

1004
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,080
Time to talk to Baradun.

1005
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,140
Hello, Baradun.

1006
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,020
Don't pour it away yet.

1007
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:03,960
I'm here.

1008
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,440
Ah, good work, Baradun.

1009
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,420
I guess I'll give you a small reward.

1010
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,080
I am, after all, very generous and handsome.

1011
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:13,920
Yay!

1012
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:14,780
More money!

1013
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,780
Hmm.

1014
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,160
Something is strange about this fish.

1015
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,800
Looks like that evil fish guy had an influence on the fish.

1016
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,800
We must investigate this more.

1017
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,980
Bring me some freshly caught carbon carp next.

1018
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,900
This is also perfect for training you and parrying.

1019
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,020
Hold...

1020
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,880
Be right before an enemy attacks.

1021
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,220
Support form a perfect block.

1022
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,160
Okay, there you go.

1023
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:35,840
See, I told you.

1024
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,780
Alright, so there is perfect parrying.

1025
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,600
Okay.

1026
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,300
How the fuck do you do perfect parry?

1027
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,200
Okay.

1028
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,480
I do it right before he does the thing.

1029
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,660
Okay.

1030
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:51,780
Alright.

1031
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,900
Just before the enemy hits.

1032
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,200
Okay.

1033
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,240
Okay, did I do it?

1034
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,060
Oh my god.

1035
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,880
Wait, did I do it?

1036
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,700
I can't tell!

1037
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,660
Did I- I can't tell!

1038
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,780
Did I...

1039
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,540
Did I do it?

1040
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,180
Okay.

1041
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,340
Oh yeah!

1042
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,260
Okay.

1043
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,520
Okay, it shows up.

1044
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,240
Okay, that's good.

1045
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,360
That's good.

1046
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,400
It's like...

1047
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,700
It's like noob friendly.

1048
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,340
That's good.

1049
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,260
That's me.

1050
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,100
That's me.

1051
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,240
Okay.

1052
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,760
Oh my god, I don't know if I did it right.

1053
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,120
Yes!

1054
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,340
Okay, I think that was it!

1055
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,300
Wait, was it?

1056
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,320
Okay, I think that was it.

1057
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh, oh.

1058
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,120
Okay.

1059
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:30,860
Oh, shit.

1060
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,680
No!

1061
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:37,430
No.

1062
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,950
I can't tell if I'm doing it correctly.

1063
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:42,810
Okay.

1064
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:43,130
Wait.

1065
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:43,670
This is it.

1066
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:44,090
This is it.

1067
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:44,530
This is it.

1068
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,710
I figured it out.

1069
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:49,410
Okay.

1070
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,030
I don't think I did it.

1071
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,930
I... I don't think I did it!

1072
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,840
Oh my god, it's so... Okay.

1073
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,200
Okay.

1074
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:01,680
Okay.

1075
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,940
That... I don't know.

1076
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,800
I don't... I can't... I don't know.

1077
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,230
Parry... Okay, guys.

1078
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,190
I don't think we're perfect parrying, guys.

1079
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,730
Just like in all the other Souls games, I don't think we can perfect parry.

1080
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,350
Great job.

1081
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,990
Now let me examine the fish and a small reward as we do for a quest well done.

1082
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:25,430
Yay!

1083
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:26,310
Tank one!

1084
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,830
This is terrible.

1085
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:32,470
This looks like the deeper the fish live, the stronger the dark powers are.

1086
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,590
There was a type of fish called a snakefish in the snake.

1087
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,310
It was a very hard fish to catch before.

1088
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,390
I'm sure it's now nearly impossible to catch one.

1089
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,610
But I have to be sure.

1090
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,050
Let me teach you this spell so you can defeat the snakefish.

1091
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,970
With this spell, you can repair your fishing rod, but it will cost you stamina.

1092
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,130
This really is a feeling a lot.

1093
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,130
Like I'm a lowly tutorial NPC now.

1094
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:00,790
Affiliate, I'm thinking for the five gifted ships.

1095
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:01,170
Thank you.

1096
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:01,870
Thank you.

1097
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,090
I did.

1098
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,450
I pressed the V, but I feel like it doesn't react in time.

1099
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,070
Simply use to cast the spell, and this is how the sorcerers do it.

1100
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,570
Also, thank you for that raid on me.

1101
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,830
Thank you.

1102
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,410
Thank you.

1103
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,470
We just... and yes, we just pressed... Now hurry up and catch that fish.

1104
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:18,230
All right.

1105
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,730
Okay, so that's how you do a fast repair.

1106
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,150
Okay.

1107
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,290
Where is that snakefish again?

1108
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,590
It's like all the way down here.

1109
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,590
Oh, there he is.

1110
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:27,090
Oh, there he is.

1111
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:27,350
Oh my god.

1112
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,150
Wait, there's so many.

1113
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:28,470
Oh!

1114
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,370
Wait, there's more down here.

1115
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:34,330
Okay.

1116
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,070
Okay, I... oh shit.

1117
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:37,390
Okay.

1118
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,410
Feel yourself.

1119
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:39,190
Whoops.

1120
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:39,710
Okay.

1121
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,370
I don't know how I can...

1122
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,010
Oh!

1123
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:44,790
Oh shit!

1124
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:45,470
Oh fuck!

1125
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:50,550
Oh my god.

1126
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,370
That's perfect.

1127
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,150
That's a perfect parry.

1128
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,190
Okay, I did it.

1129
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,570
Here I see it from his nimble body.

1130
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,010
How cunning this fish is.

1131
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,570
Many beginning anglish fish...

1132
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:01,490
Okay, I did it, guys.

1133
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:02,890
I did it.

1134
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,030
They got hands.

1135
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,790
I don't know how I did it, but I did it.

1136
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,750
I knew that spell will help you catch the fish.

1137
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,550
Man, I'm such a good sorcerer.

1138
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,950
I really am the best.

1139
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,630
Wait, he's alive!

1140
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,570
I heard some pathetic crying from the west.

1141
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,290
It must be one of the villagers.

1142
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,010
But the way is blocked by a rock.

1143
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:31,130
A few weeks ago, I ordered a chest with magic goods.

1144
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,790
But it never arrived at Honeywood.

1145
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,450
And one of the chests was a mystic scrawl.

1146
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,930
But I think the chest got lost in the lake.

1147
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,110
Can't use this magnetic hook and recover the chest.

1148
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,910
Just attach it to your fishing rod.

1149
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:43,550
Hurry!

1150
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,090
I really hope this tutorial will be over soon.

1151
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:47,910
Okay, by using...

1152
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:48,330
Oh, okay.

1153
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:50,250
Alright.

1154
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,770
So I just need to change my hook to this.

1155
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,510
And then I can have the magnetic chest.

1156
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:54,890
Yay!

1157
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,270
Okay, that's too...

1158
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:01,870
Okay, my only issue is that it doesn't tell you how much I need to do for this.

1159
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:02,730
Oh, wait.

1160
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:03,370
I'm gonna use...

1161
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:03,950
I'm gonna yoink.

1162
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,350
It's cry.wav.

1163
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,750
No!

1164
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,250
Eugene lived!

1165
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:09,570
No!

1166
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:10,010
No!

1167
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,070
Who let him live?

1168
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,870
Okay, it's like all the way here.

1169
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,150
I'm just trying to remember where it was.

1170
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:24,310
It's like here.

1171
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:28,950
Okay, I just need to move...

1172
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,130
A little bit.

1173
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:32,870
Alright.

1174
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:34,810
Nice!

1175
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,910
Okay, what's in here?

1176
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,430
Wait, what did I catch?

1177
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,210
Uh...

1178
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:45,670
Ancient rod.

1179
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:46,050
Oh!

1180
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,290
Wait, I won't use that.

1181
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:48,850
From a time...

1182
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,150
The ancestors' remnants...

1183
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:51,710
Or maybe that's just tinnitus.

1184
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:52,930
Okay, nice.

1185
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,510
Okay, that's plus 15 strength.

1186
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,010
I got the ancient rod.

1187
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,270
I got a new fishing rod.

1188
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,330
You gotta actually, like, know where it is.

1189
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,210
Alright.

1190
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:06,610
Nice!

1191
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:07,390
More money!

1192
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,290
Alright.

1193
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:11,250
Time to give...

1194
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,110
Better than his fucking squirrel.

1195
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,760
Alright.

1196
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,220
Sorry.

1197
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:18,900
Tetanus.

1198
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,120
Tetanus.

1199
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:21,840
Yeah.

1200
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,360
Yes, this is the squirrel.

1201
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,680
Thank you, Balin.

1202
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,600
Now, I will give you a demonstration of my glorious power.

1203
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,040
Stand back!

1204
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,360
Unlimited power!

1205
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,760
Yay!

1206
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,860
There.

1207
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,020
Now the path is unblocked.

1208
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,060
You're welcome.

1209
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,720
Do you know any other tutorial NPCs who can do that?

1210
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,620
Okay, nice.

1211
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,600
I got five gold.

1212
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,120
Adventure, please!

1213
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,460
I need your aid!

1214
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,920
You have to help me!

1215
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,340
Careful.

1216
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,260
This creature is dangerous.

1217
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,240
Looks like it captured that poor villager.

1218
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,000
Me hungry.

1219
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,940
Me eat human.

1220
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,060
By the gods!

1221
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,320
It can talk!

1222
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,360
I don't want to be eaten.

1223
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,760
Please help me!

1224
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,740
We have to stop.

1225
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,900
What the fuck do I do?

1226
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,140
All I do is fish!

1227
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,940
I could easily save him a simple spell if I wanted.

1228
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,120
But I have to save my magic for facing greater evils.

1229
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,400
So, you know what?

1230
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
This looks like a perfect quest for you, Bailey!

1231
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,880
What the fuck do I do?

1232
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,300
I'm just a fisherman!

1233
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,460
Yoink!

1234
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,240
Yoink!

1235
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,520
Me want fish!

1236
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,880
I will eat crybaby human!

1237
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,960
You smell like fish!

1238
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:39,880
Tasty!

1239
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,460
Bring me blue fish!

1240
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,440
Bring me and other human will be free!

1241
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:44,920
Oh, okay.

1242
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,380
Nice.

1243
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,520
He wants a very trolling trout?

1244
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,740
That fish lives in the desert of the lake!

1245
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,760
It is known for his blue color and defensive behavior.

1246
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,480
I don't think your line is long enough to reshare.

1247
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,020
You should go back to Honeywood.

1248
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,040
Maybe somebody has a longer line.

1249
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,880
Okay, so I just need to...

1250
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,280
Okay, I was gonna say, like...

1251
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,880
I don't think I've seen that fish before.

1252
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,540
Alright.

1253
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,340
Goodbye.

1254
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,720
Goodbye, everybody.

1255
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,460
I'm gonna get a longer fishing ride.

1256
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,540
I was like, what the fuck do you want me to do?

1257
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,580
I'm just a fisherman.

1258
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,120
How do I fight people when all I do is fish?

1259
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,260
Yoink.

1260
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,980
Yoink.

1261
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:24,580
Yoink.

1262
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,380
Alright.

1263
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:25,960
Nice.

1264
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,700
Thanks for the guide.

1265
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,160
Ah, Balin, you're back.

1266
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,580
You need a longer line?

1267
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,040
You're in luck.

1268
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,740
I happen to have a spare.

1269
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,540
However, I'm a bit distracted in a moment.

1270
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,320
My...

1271
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,560
Okay.

1272
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,240
Without the hammer, I'm not able to do anything.

1273
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,360
Find it for me.

1274
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:41,700
Alright.

1275
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,980
Guys, I wonder where that new hammer...

1276
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,540
Where his hammer is.

1277
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,940
Let's try and see if it's down here.

1278
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,480
Whoa, there it is.

1279
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,120
Alright.

1280
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,820
Where ever could it be?

1281
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,760
Hey, Balin.

1282
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,520
My grandfather's hammer.

1283
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,040
Where did you find it?

1284
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,580
Thank you for retrieving it.

1285
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,800
The wrapper with this hammer was rightfully given to me by my grandfather on his deathbed.

1286
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,380
I don't know what I would do without it.

1287
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,360
I vowed never to lose this hammer again.

1288
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,700
Oh, and here's the longer line for you.

1289
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,880
Thank you, Balin.

1290
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,900
By the way, I can sell you stuff now.

1291
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,560
You can earn gold by selling fish to Fred.

1292
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,480
Oh, wait.

1293
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,220
What does he sell?

1294
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,140
Advanced rod, essential rod, pro rod.

1295
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,020
Okay, I can almost get that.

1296
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,200
Oh.

1297
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,400
I see you got a longer line.

1298
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:44,400
So now your next step is to catch the special fish for that pesky goblin, right?

1299
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,820
Do you understand what you're trying to reel in?

1300
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,600
This fish might be peaceful and weak, but it's heavily armored.

1301
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,160
You'll never pull out while you're just a flimsy fishing rod.

1302
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,140
Luckily, I know a spell which could be useful.

1303
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,520
The first spell I show you affects you, but this one affects your enemy.

1304
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,860
You'll do a lot of damage in exchange for stamina.

1305
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,460
You can cast a spell by using down to attack your target.

1306
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,740
Man, you're really lucky to have such a powerful sorcerer teaching you things.

1307
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,560
I am really the best.

1308
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,880
Alright, I have so much garlic now.

1309
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,260
Alright, I find the blue fish.

1310
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,880
I still don't know how to properly do the perfect parry.

1311
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,380
There's like a slight delay.

1312
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,060
I noticed when I try to do it.

1313
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,740
Oh, there he is.

1314
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,600
Okay, I just need him to swim over.

1315
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,940
Hello, please swim over.

1316
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,080
Okay, I'm just...

1317
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,700
Did he just swim over by then?

1318
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,660
I think he has a long way to...

1319
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,400
Yeah, no, I'm just gonna go back.

1320
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,140
I think he has a long way until he gets to me.

1321
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:52,340
Alright.

1322
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,520
Oh, wait, he doesn't like garlic.

1323
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,120
I forgot.

1324
00:53:59,100 --> 00:53:59,780
Oh, there we go.

1325
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,660
Alright, get over here.

1326
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:03,720
Alright.

1327
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,100
Damage spell!

1328
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,480
Okay, that's fine.

1329
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,760
Oh, shit.

1330
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,740
Okay, I wasn't reading.

1331
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,980
But that's okay.

1332
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,180
That's okay.

1333
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,280
Reading is for losers.

1334
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,740
Okay.

1335
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,200
Yay!

1336
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,680
This guy is being really shy.

1337
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,820
We did it.

1338
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:31,720
Yay.

1339
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,400
You got this.

1340
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,600
Yay!

1341
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:35,760
Reading!

1342
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,080
Okay, I wanna catch one more...

1343
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,900
One more of these.

1344
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,440
I need practice fishing.

1345
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,500
I actually...

1346
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,900
Okay.

1347
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,520
Okay, this is very convenient, though.

1348
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,240
This spell is really good.

1349
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:50,400
Okay.

1350
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,640
Blocking.

1351
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:53,840
Nice.

1352
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,460
Oh, shit.

1353
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,080
Oh, my God.

1354
00:54:59,140 --> 00:54:59,940
He doesn't have to...

1355
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,420
Oh, my God.

1356
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,160
He doesn't teach you how to block anymore.

1357
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,820
He doesn't teach you how to parry.

1358
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,080
They're already sending me out into the ocean.

1359
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,340
Alright, here we go.

1360
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,520
They look like the guys who...

1361
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,440
Oh, it is the same guys.

1362
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,540
No, it is the same guys.

1363
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:20,800
These are the guys that made all these sketches for PUBG back then.

1364
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,700
Me smell of tasty fish.

1365
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,660
Give to me a me free human.

1366
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,660
Thank you, Baylen.

1367
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,680
Can you please escort me back to Honeywood?

1368
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,120
Alright, let's...

1369
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,380
He didn't blow up.

1370
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,300
Oh, wait.

1371
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,240
He also buys fish.

1372
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,160
Look at that.

1373
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,560
Me want fish.

1374
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,260
Alright, my price...

1375
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:42,540
Oh, wait!

1376
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
He gives me four?

1377
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,680
Oh, wait.

1378
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:44,920
No.

1379
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,500
Actually, that's not good.

1380
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,000
Is this Deltarune?

1381
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,020
I went to sleep yesterday while you were trying to get it to work.

1382
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,660
Yes, this is Deltarune.

1383
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,320
Thank you for the super chat.

1384
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:00,840
Thank you.

1385
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,660
Thank you.

1386
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:02,880
Wait.

1387
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:03,580
No.

1388
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,940
Something's not right.

1389
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:06,980
What's this?

1390
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,480
Yeah, chapter three is a fishing video game.

1391
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,340
By the gods!

1392
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,700
It's...

1393
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,420
Threwed off the fears!

1394
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,540
Nobody has seen this foul water dragon in ages.

1395
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,380
Much less near-beloved Honeywood.

1396
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,120
It's going to kill us.

1397
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,860
Adventurers call this one a boss.

1398
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,980
It has a different combat style than fish who've caught before.

1399
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,120
There's no pull and relax space.

1400
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:39,620
Just hit that fiend really hard and fast and block incoming attacks in the right moments.

1401
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:46,700
I beg you please, defeat the monstrous creatures or I will never see Honeywood and my wife again.

1402
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,660
Rike.

1403
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:50,780
I won.

1404
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:50,880
Whoops.

1405
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,180
Wait.

1406
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:52,500
What?

1407
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,800
But when would an attack?

1408
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,840
How would I know...

1409
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:58,980
Oh.

1410
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,640
Oh my God.

1411
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,040
Okay, watch this.

1412
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:01,940
Boom!

1413
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,340
Boom!

1414
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,060
Boom!

1415
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,220
Okay, there we go.

1416
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,720
Okay, I figured it out.

1417
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,600
Oh my god, okay, never mind.

1418
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,300
Clearly I didn't figure it out.

1419
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,880
Clearly... clearly... clearly... oh my god.

1420
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,280
Clearly I didn't.

1421
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:18,920
Got it.

1422
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,080
I have time to do this.

1423
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,660
Okay, nice.

1424
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,160
I think if I know how to perfect parry, it would look cooler.

1425
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,360
It would look so much cooler.

1426
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,320
It is...

1427
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,480
Oh, oh!

1428
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,360
Oh, I did it!

1429
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,220
Okay, I figured it out.

1430
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,520
I think I figured it out.

1431
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,640
Okay, watch.

1432
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,780
Oh my god.

1433
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,420
Oh, Dragon Rage.

1434
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:49,720
Okay.

1435
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,680
Okay, I think I definitely figured it out.

1436
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,120
Oh my god, it does look so much cooler.

1437
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,320
Okay.

1438
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,520
Oh no.

1439
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,140
I can't keep doing it though.

1440
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,200
Oh!

1441
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,620
Wait, my phone died!

1442
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:06,780
No!

1443
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,620
My phone died, please!

1444
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:09,400
Please!

1445
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,580
No!

1446
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,440
It's not fair!

1447
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,950
Oh, okay, there we go.

1448
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:32,130
Everything's fine.

1449
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:34,310
Everything's fine.

1450
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,010
What time?

1451
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:37,410
What time?

1452
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:38,410
Okay.

1453
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,830
Okay, I realized what is wrong, guys.

1454
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:48,110
I forgot to charge my phone when I was going... when I was out.

1455
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:48,850
So...

1456
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:49,970
So...

1457
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:50,910
So...

1458
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:52,530
So...

1459
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,470
So it's like absorbing it more...

1460
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,610
I'm using up more of the battery...

1461
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,710
...than...

1462
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,590
...than it's charging.

1463
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,910
I'm not charging it fast enough...

1464
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:07,290
...for the use of it.

1465
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:08,450
You...

1466
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,550
You did it!

1467
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,370
What a fight!

1468
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,950
Seems like it trapped a magical ring.

1469
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,210
You should go to your inventory and equip it like adventurers do.

1470
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:18,990
Let's hurry back now.

1471
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,850
I'm sure my wife isn't in great danger right now.

1472
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,550
But you never know with these questlines.

1473
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,290
No, I just have a weak charger.

1474
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,010
Right now.

1475
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,170
Okay, let's equip this.

1476
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:33,730
Wait, where is it?

1477
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,490
Where's my ring?

1478
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:36,330
Oh, there it is.

1479
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,990
Move cursors.

1480
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,650
To equip with IMA.

1481
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:41,170
Okay.

1482
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:42,030
Timing.

1483
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:42,890
Oh, wait, there you go.

1484
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:43,590
Shows timing.

1485
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:44,570
Okay, I need that.

1486
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:46,090
Okay, wait.

1487
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:46,830
Give me a sec.

1488
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:47,990
Sorry.

1489
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:48,750
Every...

1490
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,430
It's been...

1491
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,610
It's been a very scuffed day.

1492
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:57,750
Alright, let's see if this works, guys.

1493
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:58,710
Let's...

1494
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:01,890
Let's see...

1495
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,770
Let's see if this works.

1496
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,030
I'm risking it.

1497
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,950
I'm risking it.

1498
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,010
Alright.

1499
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:11,190
Okay.

1500
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:14,870
Alright.

1501
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,550
Let's put it on.

1502
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:18,970
Okay.

1503
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:21,590
I'm risking it.

1504
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:21,990
I'm risking it.

1505
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:23,850
There you go.

1506
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,190
Maybe now.

1507
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,730
Maybe now.

1508
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:26,890
Maybe now.

1509
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:28,030
I can save...

1510
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,450
I can save battery.

1511
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:35,570
Alright.

1512
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,110
Alright, don't worry.

1513
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,290
Today's the last day.

1514
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:39,750
Today.

1515
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,530
My soul is back.

1516
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:42,710
Don't worry.

1517
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,510
My soul is now back.

1518
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:45,710
Alright.

1519
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:47,270
Hello.

1520
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:48,730
Okay.

1521
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:49,850
We gotta give him...

1522
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,030
Take him back to his home.

1523
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,590
Alright.

1524
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:53,250
Go home.

1525
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,190
Thank you for bringing me home.

1526
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:55,690
Thank you for bringing me home, Balen.

1527
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:58,070
I was always remembering your act of kindness.

1528
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:03,390
It seems like Greg wants to talk to you.

1529
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:03,930
Uh-huh.

1530
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,470
Uh-huh.

1531
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,510
Uh-huh.

1532
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:32,990
Uh-huh.

1533
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:38,850
That man is cry.wav, and you're laughing.

1534
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:44,010
By the way, while you've been busy fighting dragons, I've been restocking my goods.

1535
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,410
Which I can trade.

1536
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,530
Talk to me anytime if you want useful stuff.

1537
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:52,590
But if you don't mind, oh mighty warrior Balin, can you catch me some fish for my compost pile?

1538
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:56,370
My garlic business dire meat and some more, well, garlic.

1539
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:04,230
A good healthy compost pile not only provides fertile soil for my garlic to grow faster, but also brings in some worms.

1540
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,310
Maybe they'll come in handy very soon.

1541
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:13,450
You know, there's a fish just perfect for composting as it rots really quickly.

1542
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:14,110
Yum!

1543
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:19,690
You can find a picky pike in the greater depths, but only experienced fishermen can reach it.

1544
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,650
But the fish seems to be a bit tough.

1545
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,530
I recommend you use some potion to restore some stamina.

1546
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:27,910
It's dangerous to go alone, so take this.

1547
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:28,770
Oh, nice.

1548
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:30,170
Good luck, Balin.

1549
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,970
Come back when you have the picky pike.

1550
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,610
And tell me how the potion tastes.

1551
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:33,930
Okay.

1552
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:34,970
Oh, so Balin...

1553
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:35,350
Wait.

1554
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,950
Greg sells potions?

1555
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,730
When the fuck did Greg sell potion?

1556
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,470
You are a garlic farmer.

1557
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,490
Where are you getting these potions?

1558
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,450
Wait, what happened to Greg's house?

1559
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:46,850
Um...

1560
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:50,750
An evil Cthulhu guy came over and destroyed everything.

1561
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,950
And now the servers are down, so only I can save the world.

1562
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:57,350
Alright.

1563
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,710
Maybe it's a garlic potion.

1564
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:04,670
So, like, the only adventurer right now is me because the servers are down.

1565
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:06,630
Wait, there's a chest here.

1566
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:08,630
Alright.

1567
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,330
Money!

1568
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:10,910
Ooh!

1569
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,470
An EXP orb!

1570
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:13,590
Nice.

1571
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:14,810
I'm level 7 now.

1572
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,630
Alright, let's see.

1573
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,230
I think it has to be the...

1574
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:19,950
Uh, okay.

1575
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:23,610
That has to be the thing that I'm supposed to catch.

1576
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:25,330
What is he like?

1577
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:26,710
Wait, no.

1578
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:27,330
What?

1579
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:29,570
Is that not him?

1580
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:30,810
Or is it this guy?

1581
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:31,710
Oh, okay.

1582
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:33,030
No, that's the catfish.

1583
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:36,850
Some fish bite into everything and get even without bait.

1584
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:37,350
Okay.

1585
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:40,170
Okay.

1586
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:40,850
Oh.

1587
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:41,650
Whoops.

1588
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:43,730
I'm...

1589
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:43,870
Oh.

1590
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:44,370
Nice.

1591
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,310
Alright.

1592
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,230
Okay, nice.

1593
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:50,890
Oh, I'm doing it, guys.

1594
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:51,710
Oh, shit!

1595
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:52,190
I...

1596
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,950
I...

1597
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:58,730
Okay.

1598
01:03:59,010 --> 01:03:59,530
Okay.

1599
01:03:59,530 --> 01:03:59,630
Okay.

1600
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,090
I was doing it.

1601
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:03,530
I...

1602
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:08,030
Never mind.

1603
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:08,930
Never.

1604
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,630
She caught her hope.

1605
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:13,090
Stop.

1606
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:14,650
Okay.

1607
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:15,830
I...

1608
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,330
Guys, never hope.

1609
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:18,810
Never hope.

1610
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:20,670
Never hope.

1611
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:21,910
Never st- believe.

1612
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:23,770
Believing is wrong.

1613
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,790
Okay.

1614
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:27,630
Okay.

1615
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:29,910
Now it should be fine.

1616
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:32,450
What the fuck?

1617
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:32,850
Okay.

1618
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:33,610
What?

1619
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:36,670
Okay.

1620
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,330
Never believe, guys.

1621
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,770
Believing is a lie.

1622
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,110
What the fuck?

1623
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,530
That was perfect.

1624
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:48,770
That should have been perfect.

1625
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,670
I'm just gonna block right now.

1626
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,950
I can't be bothered anymore.

1627
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:54,690
Oh, shit!

1628
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:57,110
Okay.

1629
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:00,350
This is some hardcore fishing in Deltarune, guys.

1630
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:04,510
Oh, my God.

1631
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:05,150
He's almost there.

1632
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:06,890
Oh, nice.

1633
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:07,690
All right.

1634
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:12,590
He only prefers a certain type of bait at a certain time, on a certain day, at a certain temperature.

1635
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:13,850
It's just garlic!

1636
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,590
It's literally just garlic!

1637
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:19,830
Like... Believing and hope is alive, they tell you.

1638
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:21,930
Okay.

1639
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,730
We need, like, three, right?

1640
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,070
Okay.

1641
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:24,930
We gotta get two more.

1642
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:28,610
I learned that the hard way today during the Summer Game Fest.

1643
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,430
I was so happy.

1644
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,870
I legitimately thought that, uh...

1645
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:37,090
I thought we were gonna get Nicktoons Unite.

1646
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,930
A sequel to Nicktoons Unite.

1647
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:44,270
And then it was just some shitty, uh, fucking, uh, low-budget game.

1648
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,750
They killed multiverses for this.

1649
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:47,670
Like...

1650
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,410
I was so scared.

1651
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,590
I was actually like, no way.

1652
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:56,750
They're actually gonna do a reboot to, uh, catch anything big lately.

1653
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:57,190
Morning!

1654
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:58,050
Morning, Paul!

1655
01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:59,610
Thank you for the super chat.

1656
01:05:59,690 --> 01:05:59,930
Thank you.

1657
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:00,550
Thank you.

1658
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,090
I lost hype so fucking fast.

1659
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:05,670
I was so sad.

1660
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,370
I... Legitimately, they were, like, Nicktoons.

1661
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:10,950
And then, like, Timmy started saying stuff.

1662
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,510
And then, like, they included Timmy.

1663
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:17,510
And then, like, you could sort of vaguely see, like, you know, Danny Phantom.

1664
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,310
And, uh, Jimmy Neutron.

1665
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:21,990
And it was literally some shh.

1666
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,230
And then you hear SpongeBob.

1667
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,850
And it's just... It was just some fucking, uh...

1668
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:27,650
I don't even know what game they were doing.

1669
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,270
I didn't even... I can't even tell what game it was!

1670
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:31,970
Like, I can't even tell!

1671
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,110
Yeah, it was so good back then.

1672
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:39,230
That's why I was so sad.

1673
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:44,130
That's why I was, like, really, really sad that it wasn't what I thought it was.

1674
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:48,310
And look, I can't believe they killed multiverses for that shh.

1675
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:51,550
Okay, nice block.

1676
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:54,450
Holy shh, it was so far in the sea.

1677
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,550
I'm not bothering doing perfect parry.

1678
01:06:58,650 --> 01:06:59,490
I don't understand.

1679
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:04,570
I don't... I don't understand.

1680
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:06,810
Okay, nice.

1681
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,110
Yay, level A!

1682
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:13,350
Alright.

1683
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,210
And then the Resident Evil 9 bait.

1684
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:18,790
That was... I can't believe they lie.

1685
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:22,290
I can't believe they would just do that!

1686
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,410
Lie on the internet?

1687
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,970
In front of hundreds and thousands of people?

1688
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:32,030
Also, I thought it was funny that Splitgate 2 was... became a battle royale.

1689
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,250
The pikey... the picky pike!

1690
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:36,510
Thank you so much, Balin!

1691
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:38,250
My garlic will love this!

1692
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:40,790
And when my garlic is happy, I'm happy!

1693
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:41,830
Check back later!

1694
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:44,170
I bet there will be some worms for you and your fishing hook!

1695
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:48,410
But first, as a reward for your good deed, have some garlic for my storage!

1696
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,910
Still fresh, I promise!

1697
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,390
Please help!

1698
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:51,270
Oh!

1699
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:53,190
Wait, did you hear that?

1700
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:56,110
That screen clearly came from the forest!

1701
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:58,270
Be quick, mighty dragon slayer!

1702
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:00,030
Maybe the guard has seen something!

1703
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:01,090
Oh my god!

1704
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:02,410
The token!

1705
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,410
The Amy actress!

1706
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:05,550
Finally!

1707
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:06,850
A woman!

1708
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:08,690
I need your aid!

1709
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,330
Just buy... do you wanna help me and my family?

1710
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:13,070
Just buy some of our hands!

1711
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:13,470
Ooh!

1712
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:14,890
I could have a bucket!

1713
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,150
Oh my god, guys!

1714
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,910
I heard the bucket is a really good exploit!

1715
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:18,770
We gotta get it!

1716
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,750
We have... we have to get the bucket!

1717
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:28,010
I heard you can skip all the way to, like, three chapters!

1718
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,390
For the peace of the kingdom!

1719
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,230
Nice day for fishing, ain't it?

1720
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,230
The bucket skipped!

1721
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,190
There was a horrible scream coming from the woods!

1722
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:45,810
My sandals could get me over any obstacle in the woods easily, you know?

1723
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,990
So I could check out the screams!

1724
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,670
But no can do, sir!

1725
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:51,630
I have to protect Honeywood!

1726
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:52,690
What?

1727
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:54,350
You want leisure sandals?

1728
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:56,950
You wanna enter the forest and investigate the screams?

1729
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:59,470
But you're just a lowly background fisherman!

1730
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:06,630
I could give you my precious sandals, but if I can't jump over the scoundrels anymore, I will need to get something to protect myself!

1731
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,670
Get me some armor, and I will part with the sandals!

1732
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,720
The breastplate of Argon!

1733
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,000
A legendary piece of armor!

1734
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,700
Should be quite fitting for protecting the peace of the kingdom!

1735
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,920
Maybe ask the blacksmith about it!

1736
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,160
Alright, I shall ask other you about this!

1737
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,940
I shall ask Rowan number two about this!

1738
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,360
Hey, Balin!

1739
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:29,600
Balin!

1740
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,560
My old pal!

1741
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,880
What brings you here in this dire times?

1742
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:34,680
The breastplate of Argon?

1743
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,780
Don't know why you need heavy armor to go fishing!

1744
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,100
In fact, your class doesn't allow any armor at all!

1745
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,280
Whatever that means!

1746
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,200
What?

1747
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,540
You need it for the guard?

1748
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:49,760
You're gonna wear those stinky sandals just to jump over some stuff?

1749
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,120
That's weird!

1750
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,560
But you do you, Balin!

1751
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,040
Tell you what, Balin!

1752
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:57,300
You definitely earn a reward for whacking that dragon upon!

1753
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,900
And I'll totally give you the breastplate of Argon!

1754
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,360
Unfortunately, I don't have it anymore!

1755
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,900
Remember that angry squid guy?

1756
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,780
I could've trashed that piece of seafood myself!

1757
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,340
I just didn't want to!

1758
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,600
Anyone attacked!

1759
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,960
A lot of my stuff was blown into the lake!

1760
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,160
You own a fishing rod!

1761
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,180
I know how to- Okay, skip!

1762
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:16,840
Skip-a!

1763
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:17,960
Okay, skip-a!

1764
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,920
Alright, let's go!

1765
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,460
I got enough lore!

1766
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,460
I got enough lore!

1767
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:26,860
I got enough lore!

1768
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:27,880
I am allowed to skip!

1769
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,160
It's part of the story!

1770
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:29,740
Alright!

1771
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,700
Skip-a!

1772
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,080
Skip-a!

1773
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:32,300
Accept!

1774
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,620
Guys, I'm allowed to skip!

1775
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,120
It's part of the game!

1776
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,500
Okay, I assume it's that, right?

1777
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,800
Which one am I trying to fish for?

1778
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,360
Okay.

1779
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:47,560
Wait!

1780
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:47,860
Yeah!

1781
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,420
But he owns three fishing rods!

1782
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:49,860
Oh yeah!

1783
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:50,680
I knew it!

1784
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,200
I knew that was- that was it!

1785
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,280
Okay!

1786
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,200
Alright!

1787
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,800
Just don't skip Greg!

1788
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,800
As long as I don't skip Greg, it's fine!

1789
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:01,920
Okay!

1790
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,740
I found out what I needed to do!

1791
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,500
And I was like, skip-a-skip-a!

1792
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,720
This is the one game where I'm legally allowed to skip stuff!

1793
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:10,740
Wait!

1794
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:11,460
Is that not it?

1795
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,200
What the fuck did I pick up?

1796
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:15,500
Oh!

1797
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,040
It was just literally wood!

1798
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:17,600
Okay!

1799
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,140
What the fuck?

1800
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,650
What is it?

1801
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:25,390
Where is it?

1802
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:28,690
No, I found wood!

1803
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:33,820
Oh shit!

1804
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:34,780
Oh my god!

1805
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:35,660
Oh shit!

1806
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:36,920
Okay!

1807
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,340
I was not expecting that!

1808
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:38,980
Hahaha!

1809
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,960
I forgot that, um, he eats anything!

1810
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:43,940
I was like, my magnet!

1811
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:45,220
Hahaha!

1812
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,080
Oh shit!

1813
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:48,420
Okay!

1814
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,920
Just- I guess I'll just die!

1815
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:50,660
Sorry!

1816
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,880
I- I cannot be bothered!

1817
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,120
Hahaha!

1818
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,380
Magnetic wood!

1819
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:55,640
Yeah!

1820
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,180
I was gonna say!

1821
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,300
I found it!

1822
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:58,820
Oh, I see it!

1823
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:59,260
I see it!

1824
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,140
It's like, over there!

1825
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,160
The glowing thing, right here!

1826
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:06,800
Alright, here you go!

1827
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,940
Yeah, I was gonna say!

1828
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:10,880
I was like, what the fuck?

1829
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:11,860
That was my magnet!

1830
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,320
He's just very hungry!

1831
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,300
He's so hungry!

1832
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,460
How are you so hungry?

1833
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,780
You have fish everywhere!

1834
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,060
Like, are you stupid?

1835
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:24,700
Alright!

1836
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,380
Hello, babe!

1837
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:27,720
Uh...

1838
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,480
Baradun, I got- I got this!

1839
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:29,860
Oh wait!

1840
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,500
Not Baradun!

1841
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,140
Sorry!

1842
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,100
All your names start with B!

1843
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,300
I'm getting confused!

1844
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:35,020
Sorry!

1845
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,180
Bog- Bogger!

1846
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,120
Balan, my man!

1847
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,480
Bogger, sorry!

1848
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,380
The one and only breastplate of Argon!

1849
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:46,200
Legendary armor worn by the greatest adventurer!

1850
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:47,760
Um...

1851
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:53,100
If we were all of them as a QA, if functionality exists, it should be exploited, such as...

1852
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:53,660
Zero!

1853
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:54,780
Thank you for the super chat!

1854
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,120
Thank you!

1855
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:55,780
Thank you!

1856
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,960
The finest fighter and noblest kings alike!

1857
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,040
The pinnacle of blacksmithing!

1858
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,080
No, wait!

1859
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,040
This is just some rusty piece of crap!

1860
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,300
Actually, give me a few minutes.

1861
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,920
I'll try to get rid of the rust, remove some of the dents, and give it a paint job!

1862
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,080
Make it nice and shiny again!

1863
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,420
Alright.

1864
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:19,000
It's finished!

1865
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,400
A unique breastplate of Argon!

1866
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,060
Probably the best there is!

1867
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,540
See you soon, pal!

1868
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:25,580
Nice!

1869
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:26,620
It was just that easy!

1870
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,720
Alright, let's go!

1871
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,860
Don't accept his side quest if he's getting his hand!

1872
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,260
Okay, but, like, it's free money!

1873
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,460
A king and country!

1874
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,760
It really exists!

1875
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,020
I must say!

1876
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,120
I didn't expect you to actually find it!

1877
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:44,420
I guess that means say goodbye to my leisure sandals!

1878
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,940
Give me a moment, please!

1879
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,120
Alright.

1880
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:48,760
Okay.

1881
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,940
I've said farewell to my beloved sandals!

1882
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,180
Here you are!

1883
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:55,340
For king and country!

1884
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,100
Yay!

1885
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,820
I can finally jump now!

1886
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,340
Yay!

1887
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,920
Go, Balen!

1888
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:02,440
Go!

1889
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,700
You can now parkour!

1890
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,280
Oh, shit!

1891
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,640
Wait, I am actually trying to parkour!

1892
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,260
Okay!

1893
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:08,040
Hahaha!

1894
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,080
Alright, I didn't actually think I had to parkour!

1895
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,320
That was just a joke!

1896
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,500
But, okay!

1897
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,680
Also, I thought it was funny!

1898
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:24,100
People were, like, really mad about the fact that Square Enix, um, made a- Wait, what the fuck?

1899
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:33,620
Square Enix made a, uh, Trouble in Terrace Town game for the release- For, like, the release of- for the Summer Game Fest release.

1900
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,320
Well, back to it!

1901
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,440
Oh my god!

1902
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,560
Rowan number four!

1903
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,180
Is it just all Rowan?

1904
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:43,940
Haha!

1905
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,620
I don't think I've seen you before!

1906
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,540
I'm the woodcutter!

1907
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:53,880
My wife and child need some wood to keep us warm in these cold winter nights, and- Wait!

1908
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,120
You're a fisherman!

1909
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,720
No fish here!

1910
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,980
I can tell you that!

1911
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:02,340
Only big old trees, and that unclimbable cliff over there!

1912
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:07,040
I suppose I could tuck down some trees to build a way up of that cliff if you're interested!

1913
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,640
But I don't think my brittle hatchet is up to this enormous task!

1914
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,460
Nice day for fishing, ain't it?

1915
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,540
Yesterday, or was it a few years ago?

1916
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:27,460
Anyway, at some point, an adventurer came by and told me about her quest for the Gilded Axe, with a fabulous edge that needs to be sharpened!

1917
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:33,320
Bring me this wondrous Gilded Axe, and I'll gladly use it to build a path up for you!

1918
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:36,240
The good townspeople of Honeywood might know about it!

1919
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:36,780
Alright!

1920
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,840
Time to go back!

1921
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:39,940
Hahaha!

1922
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,260
Alright!

1923
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:43,540
Alright!

1924
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,040
Oh my god!

1925
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,960
All that parkour for nothing!

1926
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,660
Alright, let's see...

1927
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:52,400
Where is he?

1928
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:53,900
Where...

1929
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:54,540
Who has...

1930
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,180
Who has...

1931
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,620
Oh, Fred knows where it is!

1932
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,320
Alright, Fred!

1933
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,620
I know something that smells fishy!

1934
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,100
You know, because of all the fish!

1935
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:03,480
Sorry, dumb joke!

1936
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,360
Thankfully, you're a man of humor and forgiveness!

1937
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,580
But I should make up for my insult though!

1938
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,420
You're looking for the Gilded Axe?

1939
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:10,900
Eh?

1940
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:16,560
Well, let me tell you a story about the adventure and the artifacts of ancient legends!

1941
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,180
I was swimming in the Greater Deaths recently, and took a dive a bit too far out.

1942
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:26,020
My wife, Freda, heard much about it.

1943
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,010
It made her sick would worry.

1944
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,380
She lives me a s- Oh wait!

1945
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,700
There's another woman?!

1946
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,660
A baby wearing a costume of a sad old man!

1947
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:36,100
Don't listen to him!

1948
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,220
Fred can tie a rock around his neck and swim in the ocean for all I care!

1949
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:45,400
Anyway, I saw a strange glimmer underwater.

1950
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,680
An axe, a golden one, lying on the ground.

1951
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,640
I am no dwarf, so I saw no use for it.

1952
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:52,820
Ah yes!

1953
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:54,420
A golden axe!

1954
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,560
What possible use could we have for gold?!

1955
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:04,640
As usual, if there's any chance to become financially stable, you can be sure Fred won't take it!

1956
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,770
Fred is so moe!

1957
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,040
Hahaha!

1958
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:16,680
Wait, did you ever think that maybe an axe is too heavy for an older fruit merchant to live from underwater?

1959
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,760
Wait, he's not even a fruit merchant!

1960
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,860
He sells fish!

1961
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,740
Sorry, excuse me.

1962
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,800
The axe may be the thing you're looking for, Balin.

1963
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,040
I heard you're doing quests now.

1964
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,200
He's such a- she's such a hater!

1965
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,500
She doesn't believe in him!

1966
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,940
I can't believe it!

1967
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,720
Why won't you believe in him?

1968
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,140
He's doing his best trying to provide!

1969
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,360
Look at him!

1970
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,000
He doesn't even have a home anymore!

1971
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,080
Fred is a nice guy.

1972
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,800
He's just trying to do his best.

1973
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:53,920
Alright, oh I can run while on my ship.

1974
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,880
Wait, where would the axe be?

1975
01:17:56,660 --> 01:18:01,380
I'm scared of the- I'm scared of the fucking catfish.

1976
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,820
Okay, get the gilded axe.

1977
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:06,660
Okay.

1978
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,400
What could it be?

1979
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,100
What the fuck?

1980
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:13,900
Okay, it's not here.

1981
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,020
Oh, it's over here!

1982
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,280
Wait, how the fuck do I get that?

1983
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:18,500
Wait, what?

1984
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,340
It's over there!

1985
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:25,370
How do you get that?

1986
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:31,830
I think there's something I can- Maybe- Oh wait, I can wear a hat!

1987
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:33,230
Oh wait, that is my hat!

1988
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:41,810
Wait, that's the- Uh...

1989
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:46,990
Okay, let's see if there's like anything- If like they have anything that I can use for it.

1990
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:47,470
Oh yeah!

1991
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:48,670
Your potion work!

1992
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,850
Okay, he doesn't care about that.

1993
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:52,490
Huh?

1994
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:56,050
Okay...

1995
01:18:57,390 --> 01:19:01,970
I need to figure out how to- Get that fish- Or get that axe.

1996
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:04,830
Okay, it should be here, right?

1997
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,070
Whoops.

1998
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:13,010
Okay, it's- It's here.

1999
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:14,830
Alright.

2000
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,660
Okay, whoops.

2001
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:22,820
Okay.

2002
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,780
It's here.

2003
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,030
Oh.

2004
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:33,530
Oh, I can cancel fishing.

2005
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:33,930
Okay.

2006
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:37,810
Wait, but how do I- How do I get that?

2007
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:39,630
What the fuck?

2008
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:42,190
How do I get that?

2009
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:42,210
What?

2010
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:45,690
Okay, I cancel the fishing.

2011
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:46,150
Okay.

2012
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:48,830
Listen carefully.

2013
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:51,150
My voice isn't what it once was.

2014
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:51,710
Oh!

2015
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:54,790
Hello?

2016
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,830
Hello, brave fisherman.

2017
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,630
I am called Thidan.

2018
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:02,850
Mighty light god of the seas.

2019
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:05,530
I can- Bend the line.

2020
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,110
Bend the bullet.

2021
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,510
I can help you save Azerim.

2022
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,570
Seek out my shrine at the beach.

2023
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,050
So we can have a little chat.

2024
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:14,710
I'll wait for you.

2025
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:15,610
Oh my god.

2026
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:16,690
I'm gonna have special powers.

2027
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:17,310
Don't worry.

2028
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:17,970
I'm heading over.

2029
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:18,510
Wait.

2030
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:20,290
Don't- Don't move so fast.

2031
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,310
Yeah, that's just CGI.

2032
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:26,590
Wait, is that another?

2033
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:27,350
Oh!

2034
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,090
Oh, there's more bait.

2035
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:33,190
What's this?

2036
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:33,930
Palm nut.

2037
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,090
Oh, it's more bait!

2038
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:38,850
Yeah, cause one of the fishes like palm nut.

2039
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:40,490
Oh!

2040
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:42,690
There you are.

2041
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,810
How do you do, young buck?

2042
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,990
Don't avert your eyes, freshman.

2043
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:52,210
It is I, Thidan, the light god of the seas.

2044
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:53,050
What?

2045
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:53,830
No.

2046
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,190
I won't punish you for catching fish.

2047
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:58,770
Quite the opposite.

2048
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:02,490
I'm more like one of the old gods, you know?

2049
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,990
I need sacrifices to restore my strength.

2050
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:07,490
Fish sacrifices.

2051
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,490
Which means- Oh, he wants a virgin fish.

2052
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:14,710
Which means a fishman like you would be my perfect champion.

2053
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:17,670
I know you would understand, dear Yoinker.

2054
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:20,970
Just like I understand you and your problem.

2055
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:22,490
You're on a quest.

2056
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:26,230
But current underwaters are finicky and out of your control.

2057
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:27,490
As in- What?

2058
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:28,610
He's an ancient god.

2059
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:32,910
Don't- All gods, all they want is just a virgin of their kind.

2060
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:36,710
And since he's a fish god, he would want a virgin fish.

2061
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:38,710
That you throw into the volcano.

2062
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:44,610
I, who can change water streams.

2063
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,650
But first, I will need some proof.

2064
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,150
Proof that you are worthy, kiddo.

2065
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:55,650
The lake near the town Honeywood is filled with delicious fish.

2066
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:57,890
Catch at least one of each kind.

2067
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:02,090
And sacrifice them at the statue of my refreshing likeness.

2068
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:05,770
Each sacrifice will make me stronger.

2069
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:09,950
And in return, I will be able to increase your power as well.

2070
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:11,550
But first things first.

2071
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:13,850
Uh, Belargus, thank you for the super shot.

2072
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:14,770
Thank you, thank you.

2073
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:20,030
If you do as a command, I can and will redirect the water streams.

2074
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,110
No, it's just easy.

2075
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:22,430
I'll just sacrifice the children.

2076
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:26,030
This way, you'll reach the object you desire.

2077
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,210
And you can continue your epic quest.

2078
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:31,850
A piece of old wisdom.

2079
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:34,910
Uh, there's the- Okay, they lay so many eggs.

2080
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,190
What's one child fish gonna do?

2081
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:42,810
How does that- Cuz they lay hundreds- Why do you think some animals lay hundreds of eggs?

2082
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:47,090
It's because they knew to- They knew that some of them aren't gonna survive.

2083
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:56,570
Why do you think, um, those like sea turtles fucking lay eggs in the- Um, on the beach, lay like 50 plus eggs on the beach and go, peace.

2084
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:57,390
See ya.

2085
01:22:57,710 --> 01:23:02,850
And then like, when the student- The moment they hatch, literally everyone wants to eat them.

2086
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:09,370
Because they're like, you know, only 1% of you guys are gonna live.

2087
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:15,070
So like- It's just pure statistics.

2088
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:17,910
Lord Curtis says thank you for the super chat.

2089
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:18,690
Thank you, thank you.

2090
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,950
Yes, turtles are literally born in D-Day.

2091
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:24,430
They-they-they hatch, they come out of the sand, and it's D-Day.

2092
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:29,810
You'll need palm knights as bait to catch some of the fish in the shallow water.

2093
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:33,670
It'll surprise you, but you can find them here at the palm trees.

2094
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:35,770
Don't take too long, young champion.

2095
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,950
My age may be plenty, but the patience of my bladder, you know?

2096
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:42,310
Alright, let's grab more of these.

2097
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:48,710
Alright, let's go over there and sacrifice our fish.

2098
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:53,010
Okay, and then- Oh, okay, so that's how I change my bait.

2099
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:59,670
So the more children an animal can make, the less chance they'll survive.

2100
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:02,790
Oh my god, I have to get all of that?

2101
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:05,490
Okay, that's fine.

2102
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:07,210
They have the baby ones, okay.

2103
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,210
Alright.

2104
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:16,790
This is why they're endangered.

2105
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,810
Look, they don't have the cute tacks like pandas.

2106
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,070
They're not as lucky as pandas.

2107
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:25,530
Literally, pandas...

2108
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:26,770
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

2109
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:32,390
But like, if it wasn't for human intervention, pandas would be like long gone.

2110
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:33,410
Like...

2111
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:38,510
What about rats?

2112
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,330
Rats are...

2113
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:41,830
Okay, do you know rats...

2114
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:44,550
The survivability for rats in the wild?

2115
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:47,030
It is not that much, guys.

2116
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:51,330
The survivability of rats in the wild is very, very low.

2117
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:53,130
There is a rat out there that...

2118
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:56,030
There's a rat out there in the wild where...

2119
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:57,290
Um...

2120
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:59,230
I don't know if you guys know this, but like...

2121
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:00,010
It...

2122
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:04,170
When it's time to bang, they literally bang until they get a heart attack and die.

2123
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:06,510
For the...

2124
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:08,810
For the survival of their species.

2125
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:13,590
All right.

2126
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,410
All right.

2127
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:18,690
Yeah, literally death by snooze dude.

2128
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:20,770
The tree!

2129
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:25,330
Like...

2130
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:27,470
You're like, God, I wish that was me.

2131
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:33,600
All right.

2132
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:33,760
All right.

2133
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:33,960
Here, here.

2134
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:35,860
No, there's actually a...

2135
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:37,440
A type of cat species.

2136
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,020
Um...

2137
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:40,000
Where...

2138
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:41,560
Um...

2139
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,080
Where like...

2140
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,680
It's like, the moment it's time, he just goes everywhere.

2141
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:48,240
Travel around the world.

2142
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:52,200
Travel around the plains to be like, gotta find as many as possible.

2143
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,400
And then he dies of a heart attack.

2144
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:02,380
To ensure the survival of...

2145
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:03,200
What was it?

2146
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,520
He needs to continue the bloodline.

2147
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,640
He's just trying to continue the bloodline.

2148
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:14,440
All right.

2149
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,540
We need...

2150
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,040
Honeywood and the snakefish.

2151
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:17,440
Okay.

2152
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:18,500
That's just this.

2153
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,860
Survival of the freakiest.

2154
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:23,480
Exactly.

2155
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:24,500
Okay.

2156
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:25,000
This guy.

2157
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,100
I hate this guy.

2158
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:31,120
This guy is way too strong.

2159
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:32,840
All right.

2160
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:34,640
I'm not even gonna try parry.

2161
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,880
I'll do parry for the bosses.

2162
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,960
But these guys are fucking crazy.

2163
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,140
Oh my God.

2164
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,080
I was not paying attention.

2165
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:40,960
I'm sorry.

2166
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,060
I don't read sometimes.

2167
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:48,690
Not heart attack.

2168
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:51,770
It dies of muscle digger due to much freak...

2169
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:53,590
There's one that actually dies of a heart attack.

2170
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:56,930
I remember because I watched a documentary about it.

2171
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:58,390
About...

2172
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:59,230
Okay.

2173
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:03,250
I don't remember what the documentary was really about.

2174
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,810
I just remember...

2175
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:05,170
I was...

2176
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:06,290
It was like late at night.

2177
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:09,290
It was on the National Geographic channel.

2178
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:16,610
It was on the National Geographic channel at my grandparents' place.

2179
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:17,990
And then like...

2180
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,970
I was like up in their room...

2181
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,610
Up in their bedroom.

2182
01:27:20,650 --> 01:27:21,410
And I was like...

2183
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:21,570
Woo!

2184
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:23,710
Look at this lovely nature documentary.

2185
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:26,190
I said as I was like...

2186
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:27,230
I don't know...

2187
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:28,250
11 years old.

2188
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,390
And then that like stuck with me.

2189
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:31,560
I don't know why...

2190
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:32,290
Like...

2191
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:33,630
Out of everything...

2192
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:36,850
That fun fact stuck with me for my whole life.

2193
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:37,650
Like I...

2194
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:39,410
I like remember that shit.

2195
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:42,290
For the rest of my life.

2196
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:46,310
You're back from Honeywood Lake?

2197
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:47,930
Not with empty hands.

2198
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,730
Honeywood Heron...

2199
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:50,310
Uh...

2200
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:50,950
Gurdon...

2201
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:51,550
Gooper...

2202
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:52,350
And even some...

2203
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,070
Snakefish.

2204
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:55,830
You're indeed a worthy fisherman, my dear.

2205
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:59,170
Indeed, and cunning as you are...

2206
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:02,270
You probably already guessed that the dark lord he's held in...

2207
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:03,970
The menace you faced earlier...

2208
01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:05,290
Is of my own blood.

2209
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,470
If gods have blood, that is.

2210
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:11,410
I can't deny it any longer.

2211
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:13,470
Yeez is right into the core.

2212
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:15,110
And we need to stop him.

2213
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:17,090
He was always a bit unbridled.

2214
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:21,490
But somehow, he's now out of his mind like a fish out of water.

2215
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:26,250
Thus, I am inclined to help you, champion of Thaedon.

2216
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,230
Light god of the seas.

2217
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:29,590
Let me...

2218
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:31,150
Uh...

2219
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:36,610
Let me invoke all of my current power to activate the water streams.

2220
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:41,390
This way, you will fulfill your quest to recover the gilded axe you're looking for.

2221
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,550
Oh nice, I have a new magic power.

2222
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:44,710
Alright.

2223
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:46,830
Oh no, he's just moving it closer.

2224
01:28:47,150 --> 01:28:47,670
Oh!

2225
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:49,430
Oh!

2226
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,590
Now it has like little things.

2227
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:55,170
I already told you this.

2228
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,090
I think...

2229
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:56,970
But as your gods...

2230
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:57,790
Oh my god, okay.

2231
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,630
And then...

2232
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:03,090
I felt like I was living a lie, watching all these nature documentaries.

2233
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:08,010
Because the majority of those nature documentary films were filmed without sound.

2234
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:08,890
And then...

2235
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:10,010
They add the sound...

2236
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:11,210
Post...

2237
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:11,990
Like...

2238
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:12,590
Post-production.

2239
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:15,190
Because a lot of them were recorded without sound.

2240
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:16,170
I...

2241
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:16,430
I...

2242
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:18,430
And then like...

2243
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:20,950
I felt like I was living a fucking lie.

2244
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:25,290
And I already told you this.

2245
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:27,090
I think...

2246
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:28,370
But as your guide...

2247
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:28,790
And...

2248
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:29,090
Sponsor...

2249
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:31,950
I am now able to increase your power.

2250
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:34,990
Which you would very much need, my dear tadpole.

2251
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:38,070
Sacrifice more fish to me.

2252
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:38,990
So like...

2253
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:39,870
You would hear them like...

2254
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,690
Hear like these like...

2255
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:41,510
Sound effects of like...

2256
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:41,830
You know...

2257
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:43,430
Of them like walking around...

2258
01:29:43,970 --> 01:29:44,410
Crawling...

2259
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:45,350
Or like...

2260
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:46,310
Um...

2261
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:46,830
Um...

2262
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:47,310
Yeah, I know.

2263
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:48,490
It's hard to really get a boom...

2264
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:48,850
You know...

2265
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:51,330
You stick a boom mic in front of a fucking lion.

2266
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:54,010
Like...

2267
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:55,050
Can you imagine that?

2268
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:55,630
You know like those...

2269
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,030
Hidden animal cameras.

2270
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,010
And then you put out...

2271
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:00,250
You attach a fucking giant ass mic...

2272
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:01,210
Like on the...

2273
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:02,110
Hidden camera.

2274
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:02,870
And...

2275
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:03,930
Like...

2276
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:04,090
Like...

2277
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,230
What did they say?

2278
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:06,090
Like...

2279
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:06,550
But like...

2280
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:08,190
A lot of sounds you hear...

2281
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:09,450
From nature documentaries...

2282
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:10,450
Or nature shows...

2283
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:11,110
Are like...

2284
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:12,070
Post-production...

2285
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,350
Or like...

2286
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:13,010
And they're like...

2287
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:13,470
Fake...

2288
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:13,790
Basically.

2289
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:14,550
Yeah...

2290
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:17,150
You can put a mic up to a fucking bug...

2291
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:17,830
And be like...

2292
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:18,430
Alright...

2293
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:19,410
What do the bug...

2294
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:20,190
Alright...

2295
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:20,630
Hello...

2296
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:21,010
Hello...

2297
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:22,510
We're gonna interview you.

2298
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:27,250
Oh yeah...

2299
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,750
You attach a microphone on a drone...

2300
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:30,630
And you just...

2301
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:31,930
Fly closer...

2302
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:37,190
Sacrifice more fish to me...

2303
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:38,990
At least one of each region...

2304
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:40,990
For I will enhance your spells...

2305
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:41,550
Now...

2306
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:42,950
No need to bow...

2307
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:44,370
Bow low...

2308
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:45,010
Bow low...

2309
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:45,250
Bow low...

2310
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,490
It's bad for your back...

2311
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:47,270
I can tell...

2312
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:49,430
Don't forget to use the currents...

2313
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:50,150
Okay, nice...

2314
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:51,930
Oh, it's like a little collection thing...

2315
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:53,810
Pulls...

2316
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:55,650
To inflict more damage...

2317
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:56,190
Okay, cool...

2318
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:58,750
Yeah...

2319
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:00,850
Those folly artists can't keep...

2320
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:01,930
I didn't know...

2321
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:02,430
Okay, when I...

2322
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:03,690
Okay, when I found that out...

2323
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:04,370
I felt like...

2324
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:06,450
I've been living a fucking lie...

2325
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:07,010
I'll be like...

2326
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:08,050
Oh, so that's what...

2327
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,070
So that's what ants sound like...

2328
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,010
But no...

2329
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:16,150
Stupid me for thinking there was a fucking microphone attached to that camera...

2330
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,350
I don't know...

2331
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:17,870
Like...

2332
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:18,490
I don't know...

2333
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:21,290
I don't know why I thought there was a fucking giant camera...

2334
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:23,150
Fucking attached to the ground...

2335
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:23,910
I...

2336
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:23,950
I...

2337
01:31:23,950 --> 01:31:24,290
I...

2338
01:31:24,290 --> 01:31:24,850
I...

2339
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:27,030
I...

2340
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:29,510
I...

2341
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:30,230
Oh shit...

2342
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:31,270
No, wait...

2343
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:31,710
L...

2344
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:32,610
LT...

2345
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:34,070
Swap spells...

2346
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:35,610
Nah...

2347
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:37,370
I don't want fishing...

2348
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:38,870
Get out of here...

2349
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:39,690
I'm trying to...

2350
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,130
Catch that stupid...

2351
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,130
Oh wait...

2352
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:44,890
Try to catch that stupid thing...

2353
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:45,830
What are your opinion?

2354
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:46,930
But crocodiles...

2355
01:31:47,630 --> 01:31:48,130
Rawr...

2356
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:48,570
Alright...

2357
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:49,830
Okay, I got wood...

2358
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:51,710
Nice...

2359
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:52,490
Okay...

2360
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:54,930
Oh, and then...

2361
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:55,510
I love like...

2362
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:56,390
When they do those like...

2363
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,610
You know when they do those like...

2364
01:31:57,610 --> 01:31:58,310
Hidden...

2365
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:00,350
Um...

2366
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:01,470
Those like...

2367
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:02,590
Hidden cameras...

2368
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,110
Where they...

2369
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:05,010
Make like a fake penguin or whatever...

2370
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:05,230
Like...

2371
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:07,130
A fake animal or whatever...

2372
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:08,230
And be like...

2373
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:09,310
I...

2374
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:10,090
I love...

2375
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:11,250
Oh shit...

2376
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,900
Oh, I just need to be a little bit...

2377
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:14,190
Can I...

2378
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:15,010
Do it from here?

2379
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:16,370
Okay, nice...

2380
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:16,970
No!

2381
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:17,970
Are you serious?

2382
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:18,750
Okay...

2383
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:19,230
Alright, nice...

2384
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:19,970
I got it...

2385
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:21,730
I love like the...

2386
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:22,230
Uh...

2387
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:23,150
Where they make like...

2388
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:24,850
Actual fake ass...

2389
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:26,790
Machines or whatever...

2390
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:28,190
To spy cams...

2391
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:28,530
To...

2392
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:29,070
Like...

2393
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,930
Spy on the animals...

2394
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:32,070
Yeah, but you could tell...

2395
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:32,390
Like...

2396
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:33,690
There's one with poop too...

2397
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:34,650
Where they made a fake...

2398
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:34,970
Like...

2399
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:36,830
Elephant poop to use to spy on people...

2400
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:37,750
Or...

2401
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:38,110
Sorry...

2402
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:39,010
Spy on the animals...

2403
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:39,670
Not people...

2404
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:40,490
Cause then like...

2405
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:41,230
You know...

2406
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:42,030
Ethically...

2407
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:42,570
That's wrong...

2408
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:43,670
But we can do it on the animals...

2409
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:44,950
Cause they don't know better...

2410
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:45,890
Like...

2411
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:46,550
Ah...

2412
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:48,150
So you really retrieved the axe...

2413
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:48,550
Baton...

2414
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:49,890
I'm astonished...

2415
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:52,250
See how it goes...

2416
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:54,310
Even someone who was just a stick...

2417
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:56,610
And a piece of string could do it...

2418
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:57,270
Fred...

2419
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:58,490
Proven once again...

2420
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:00,890
You're the laziest bum in town...

2421
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:02,110
Oh...

2422
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,190
My dear wife...

2423
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:04,970
Use your eyes for once...

2424
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:07,030
The axe isn't even complete...

2425
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:08,650
The handle is missing...

2426
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:09,970
It's worthless...

2427
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:13,030
I would have risked my life for nothing...

2428
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,750
Huh...

2429
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:15,410
Worthless is a strong word...

2430
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:16,890
For a fruit merchant...

2431
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:19,050
Who hasn't sold a single piece of fruit...

2432
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:19,950
For months...

2433
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:21,290
And the head of golden axe...

2434
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:21,850
Is still...

2435
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,170
The head of a golden axe...

2436
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:24,690
Genius...

2437
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,170
My bet is that...

2438
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:28,810
Bolder...

2439
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:29,510
Honeywood's...

2440
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:30,590
Muscular...

2441
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:31,670
Handsome...

2442
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:32,910
Successful...

2443
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:33,570
Blacksmith...

2444
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:35,950
Who isn't a sluggish fruit merchant...

2445
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:38,290
Would have no problem fixing it...

2446
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:38,570
Aw...

2447
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:39,550
Poor Fred...

2448
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:40,910
Guys...

2449
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:41,990
I...

2450
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:42,390
Aw...

2451
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:44,270
Fred needs someone new...

2452
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:45,530
Pralyn doesn't need to hear you...

2453
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:48,310
Whispering all those sweet nothings...

2454
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:50,890
Praying that snobbish boger of visiting...

2455
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:51,810
Showing him...

2456
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:53,970
The axe might be a good idea though...

2457
01:33:55,150 --> 01:33:55,750
Also...

2458
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,410
Here's a little word for proving...

2459
01:33:57,410 --> 01:34:00,030
I didn't imagine the axe under water...

2460
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:00,910
Spend it...

2461
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,310
Well...

2462
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,810
Perhaps for some fruits...

2463
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:05,010
From a humble poor fruit merchant...

2464
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:06,290
Bro you don't even sell fruits...

2465
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,030
I'm literally...

2466
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:09,790
I'm just selling the fish I fucking caught...

2467
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:11,570
Alright...

2468
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:13,090
Bogan...

2469
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:13,670
Baelin...

2470
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:14,270
Alright Bogan...

2471
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:15,910
Rowan number two...

2472
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:16,850
My man...

2473
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:17,650
Back again...

2474
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:18,790
Engracing me with his presence...

2475
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:20,610
What is it you're holding there?

2476
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:21,990
Nice day for fishing...

2477
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,170
Ain't it?

2478
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:26,470
The head of the gilded axe...

2479
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:27,590
Not bad...

2480
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:29,210
But without a proper handle...

2481
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,790
You can't do much with it...

2482
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:32,550
Good news for the trees out there...

2483
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:33,170
Ha ha ha...

2484
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:34,670
Tell you what...

2485
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,470
I'm in a good mood...

2486
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:39,350
And I know exactly what we need for the handle...

2487
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:40,410
Some steel...

2488
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:42,330
And some leather...

2489
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:44,430
Both might actually be up your water...

2490
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:44,810
That way...

2491
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:45,970
Watery Alley...

2492
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:46,570
First...

2493
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:50,850
The leather you can get from any dark wood digger at the beach...

2494
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:54,510
I was expecting a shipment of the steel a while ago...

2495
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:55,170
And well...

2496
01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:57,210
The ship sunk in the recent storm...

2497
01:34:57,210 --> 01:35:00,430
Should be lying on the coral gardens ground now...

2498
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,510
Guess the gods have a dumb sense of humor...

2499
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:04,310
So...

2500
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:05,850
There you have it...

2501
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:07,750
The coral's garden in the far west...

2502
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:08,710
At the coast of Azerim...

2503
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:11,190
Bring me some dark wood leather...

2504
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:11,890
And steel...

2505
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:14,390
And I'll help you fix the gilded axe...

2506
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:16,490
Maybe you get the steel with some magnet thing...

2507
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:17,810
But I'm not egghead...

2508
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,750
Like Baron...

2509
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:20,130
Alright...

2510
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,690
Let's go grab...

2511
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:23,150
Is this just fetch quests?

2512
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,170
That's very...

2513
01:35:27,150 --> 01:35:29,150
Viva la dirt league of them...

2514
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:31,530
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

2515
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:33,190
What was that short?

2516
01:35:33,450 --> 01:35:34,750
Where like...

2517
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:35,750
Um...

2518
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:36,230
Uh...

2519
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,330
Where they were like...

2520
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,070
You know like...

2521
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:39,250
Um...

2522
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:39,930
Where...

2523
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,070
They would pad...

2524
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:42,950
They just like did fetch quests all of...

2525
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:43,530
All the time...

2526
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:47,150
Alright...

2527
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:47,890
Here we go...

2528
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:48,070
Wait...

2529
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:48,970
How do I get my boat?

2530
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:51,050
Wait...

2531
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:51,830
Oh wait...

2532
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:52,530
I do this...

2533
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:52,890
Okay...

2534
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,050
I was like so confused...

2535
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:54,670
Okay...

2536
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:54,990
Okay...

2537
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:56,230
I can basically...

2538
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:57,230
Alright...

2539
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:57,890
I was gonna say...

2540
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:58,810
How do I...

2541
01:35:58,810 --> 01:35:59,250
Fucking...

2542
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:00,530
Catch this...

2543
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:01,250
Okay...

2544
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:01,890
What does he want?

2545
01:36:02,450 --> 01:36:03,050
Alright...

2546
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:03,890
Do you like garlic?

2547
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:06,690
Are you a garlic fish?

2548
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:08,030
Hello...

2549
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:08,610
Alright...

2550
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:09,110
LT...

2551
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,350
The swap spells...

2552
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:11,390
Okay...

2553
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,690
What do I do to it?

2554
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:14,110
Oh shit...

2555
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:15,270
That's what I do to it...

2556
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,150
Okay...

2557
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:16,890
That's right...

2558
01:36:16,890 --> 01:36:19,330
I use all my magic...

2559
01:36:19,330 --> 01:36:20,090
Oh...

2560
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,170
Alright...

2561
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:22,110
Defending...

2562
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,150
Oh shit...

2563
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:23,530
Oh shit...

2564
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:24,750
I keep forgetting to read...

2565
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:26,630
I keep thinking he's like ready...

2566
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:29,790
Okay...

2567
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:30,110
No...

2568
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:30,570
Oh my god...

2569
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:31,310
That was like...

2570
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:31,830
So much...

2571
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:32,670
Okay...

2572
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:34,170
Don't worry...

2573
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:34,950
Oh...

2574
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,450
I'm worrying...

2575
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:40,870
Nevermind...

2576
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:41,250
Okay...

2577
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:41,950
Don't worry...

2578
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:43,050
There we go...

2579
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:43,390
Okay...

2580
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:44,230
We got one of them...

2581
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:44,990
We need three?

2582
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:46,490
Okay...

2583
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:47,750
That's five...

2584
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:50,010
Wee...

2585
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:51,230
Don't worry...

2586
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:51,270
Don't worry...

2587
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:51,470
I'm...

2588
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,630
Don't worry guys...

2589
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:53,350
Don't worry...

2590
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,750
I definitely know what I'm doing...

2591
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:58,090
Okay...

2592
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:01,030
Send him all the way here...

2593
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:01,570
And then...

2594
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:02,130
Oh my god...

2595
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:03,570
It's still...

2596
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:04,190
Okay...

2597
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:05,050
That did a lot too...

2598
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:06,770
That's good...

2599
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:07,850
I'm just gonna hold it...

2600
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:08,690
Oh...

2601
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:10,490
Blocking...

2602
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:12,190
Never punished...

2603
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:13,040
That's right...

2604
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:14,980
Okay...

2605
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:17,190
I'm just gonna hold it...

2606
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:18,980
Nice...

2607
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:19,200
Alright...

2608
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,880
We need one more...

2609
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,020
Please...

2610
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,260
Let me save the woman!

2611
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:27,040
All I wanna do is just save the woman!

2612
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:28,480
I'm...

2613
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:31,990
I swear to god...

2614
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:35,180
It's been so long...

2615
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,220
I feel like they told me about the woman and then like...

2616
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:42,020
Nothing ever happened...

2617
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:45,400
Okay...

2618
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:45,560
Okay...

2619
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:47,200
Nice...

2620
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:50,780
Why save the woman instead of fishing?

2621
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,260
You're right...

2622
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:53,000
Balen wouldn't...

2623
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,480
Balen wouldn't want that...

2624
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,040
All Balen wants to do is fish...

2625
01:37:58,820 --> 01:37:59,500
Okay...

2626
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,400
That should be the seal I need...

2627
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:01,940
Okay...

2628
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:03,500
I need five...

2629
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:04,300
Oh wait...

2630
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,160
It's all here...

2631
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,020
It's literally all here...

2632
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:09,880
Okay...

2633
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:13,340
Let's grab some more nuts just in case...

2634
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:15,020
I have three...

2635
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:15,880
Oh fuck...

2636
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,190
The woman can wait...

2637
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,880
This is much more important...

2638
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,220
Okay...

2639
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:28,900
Nice...

2640
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:30,860
Okay nice...

2641
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:32,020
I got all five...

2642
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:32,800
Yeah...

2643
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,000
Alright...

2644
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,070
Time to talk to Bulger...

2645
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,160
I am...

2646
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,110
I'm grabbing more nuts...

2647
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:42,110
Fish more important...

2648
01:38:42,110 --> 01:38:42,450
Doki...

2649
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:43,130
How dare you...

2650
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:47,330
Balen has no time for women...

2651
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:48,390
He needs a fish...

2652
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:53,570
Every day is a nice day for fishing...

2653
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:55,850
Alright...

2654
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:56,670
Let's go back...

2655
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:00,850
Teach men...

2656
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:02,050
Women starve...

2657
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:02,990
Teach men...

2658
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:03,390
Fish...

2659
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:04,150
Hungry...

2660
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:04,830
Not...

2661
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:06,090
Lifetime...

2662
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:08,370
One...

2663
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:10,490
Alright...

2664
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:12,470
There's some very strong steel...

2665
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:15,310
And the smoothest litter I've ever laid my eyes on...

2666
01:39:15,650 --> 01:39:16,210
Of course...

2667
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:17,670
I'll keep some for myself...

2668
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:18,890
I'm not an adventurer...

2669
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:19,230
Thus...

2670
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:21,230
My work isn't free...

2671
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:21,910
Still...

2672
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:26,430
This is more than enough to forge a nice handle for your gilded axe...

2673
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:27,290
Yay...

2674
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:27,750
Here...

2675
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,810
I can glue this together...

2676
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:30,370
Alright...

2677
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:32,090
But to make it actually work...

2678
01:39:33,470 --> 01:39:34,230
Yay...

2679
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:36,570
I glued it together...

2680
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:36,870
See...

2681
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,230
I was just visiting...

2682
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:39,370
Greg...

2683
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:41,410
To tell him how better my quest art than this...

2684
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:41,970
And my return...

2685
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:42,450
Okay...

2686
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:43,530
Alright...

2687
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:44,090
Alright...

2688
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:46,070
Time to get the hammer guys...

2689
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:48,130
I wonder where his hammer is...

2690
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:48,850
Oh...

2691
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:49,330
My...

2692
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:50,030
God...

2693
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:52,450
His grandfather's hammer that he'll...

2694
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:53,650
For sure...

2695
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:55,090
Never lose...

2696
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:56,970
There we go...

2697
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:57,350
Wow...

2698
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:59,510
Can't believe I got it...

2699
01:39:59,510 --> 01:40:01,250
Here you go...

2700
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:02,610
Booger...

2701
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:03,250
Hey Balen...

2702
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,230
By the gods...

2703
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:07,230
You found my grandfather's hammer...

2704
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:07,970
My hammer...

2705
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:09,630
I gotta do my dailies...

2706
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:10,450
Give me a sec guys...

2707
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:12,250
Gotta do my dailies...

2708
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:15,110
Just how much this hammer is rightfully mine...

2709
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:15,830
Not my brother's...

2710
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:16,710
I vow...

2711
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,970
Never lose it again...

2712
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:20,070
And you brought the parts with the gilded axe too...

2713
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:21,630
With my hammer...

2714
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:23,930
Everything's ready...

2715
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:25,910
It's finished...

2716
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:27,550
Here you are pal...

2717
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:29,750
The gilded axe in its full glory...

2718
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:31,750
Now go hack some fishers or something...

2719
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:32,810
Alright...

2720
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:33,730
Time to...

2721
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:34,210
Finally...

2722
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:34,670
Is it time?

2723
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:36,630
Can I finally save the woman?

2724
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,130
Alright...

2725
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:38,730
Time to re...

2726
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:39,490
Meet...

2727
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:39,770
Where...

2728
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,110
It's time to meet...

2729
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:41,830
Uh...

2730
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:42,870
Rowan 4...

2731
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:44,690
Again...

2732
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:45,650
Okay...

2733
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:46,150
Wait...

2734
01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:47,110
I have to parkour...

2735
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:48,930
It's actual parkour...

2736
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:50,850
Alright...

2737
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:51,570
Rowan 4...

2738
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:53,330
These trees ain't gonna chop themselves down...

2739
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:54,470
Look at that colour...

2740
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:55,570
I love it...

2741
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:56,810
With this fine tool...

2742
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:59,590
Cutting those big trees should be no problem...

2743
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:00,970
Wait here for an hour or so...

2744
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:02,650
Just need a short breather...

2745
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:02,970
Alright...

2746
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:03,230
Sorry...

2747
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:05,730
They ran out of budget to animate this part...

2748
01:41:05,730 --> 01:41:05,870
Um...

2749
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:07,970
Pixel animation is very hard guys...

2750
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:08,330
Uh...

2751
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:10,070
Just like...

2752
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,470
Um...

2753
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:11,590
In the world of Azrim...

2754
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:12,630
When they had to cut the CGI...

2755
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:16,050
Quite the work that was...

2756
01:41:16,050 --> 01:41:17,990
But look at the gilded axe...

2757
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:19,310
Not a single scratch...

2758
01:41:19,310 --> 01:41:20,350
And me neither...

2759
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:21,150
Which is a welcome change...

2760
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:23,350
The way up the hill is ready...

2761
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:24,050
Be careful though...

2762
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:27,190
My nose is telling me it won't be the safest place...

2763
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:29,050
At least not the place with the nicest smell...

2764
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:31,230
Thanks again for the axe...

2765
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:33,050
I don't need to cut down one more tree...

2766
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:34,370
So I can sell the wood...

2767
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:36,210
But you can have some as a reward...

2768
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:39,450
My wife and child will be warm on this winter night...

2769
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:40,010
Alright...

2770
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:40,510
Nice...

2771
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:41,370
Parkour...

2772
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,750
Woah...

2773
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,630
Woah...

2774
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:44,750
I'm the best...

2775
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:47,630
I sense that you're approaching dangerous territory...

2776
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:50,990
Orcs of Swarmogara are overhead...

2777
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:52,630
They are known to be quite hostile...

2778
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:54,170
Um...

2779
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:54,910
And currently...

2780
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:57,670
They have several travelers in their clutches...

2781
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:59,870
It would be a bad idea could go near them...

2782
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:03,630
As you're not a mighty high sorcerer like myself...

2783
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:07,550
But it doesn't seem you're level up enough for fighting orcs...

2784
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:07,810
Unfortunately...

2785
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:10,410
I have important manners to ponder...

2786
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:11,690
And can't take care of the orcs...

2787
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:14,530
You should consult the townsfolk at Honeywood...

2788
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:15,870
To see if anyone has...

2789
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:16,570
Oh my...

2790
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:17,810
I'm dropping down...

2791
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:18,850
Oh, I can't...

2792
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:19,430
There's an invisible...

2793
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:21,030
I'm dropping down...

2794
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,590
You don't...

2795
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:21,890
You don't...

2796
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:22,750
Oh, I can't...

2797
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:23,710
Aww...

2798
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:29,730
No...

2799
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:32,590
I have to go back to Honeywood?

2800
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:34,930
Oh my god...

2801
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:35,030
Oh my god...

2802
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:37,330
I just want to save the woman!

2803
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:38,770
I...

2804
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:43,730
Oh my god...

2805
01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:44,930
Oh, friend...

2806
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:45,270
What...

2807
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:45,930
Okay, you know what?

2808
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:46,670
Fuck this...

2809
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:47,330
Alright...

2810
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:47,910
Fuck this...

2811
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:48,630
How much is the hat?

2812
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:49,310
How much...

2813
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:50,210
Okay...

2814
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:51,350
Alright...

2815
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:52,150
Fuck this...

2816
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:53,150
I'm selling my...

2817
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:54,170
Fish...

2818
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:54,850
Okay...

2819
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,390
Skipa skipa skipper...

2820
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:57,320
Skip skip...

2821
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,130
Skip...

2822
01:42:58,130 --> 01:42:59,010
Alright...

2823
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:00,330
I'm selling stuff...

2824
01:43:00,330 --> 01:43:01,190
Skip Skip Skip Skip...

2825
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:01,690
Okay...

2826
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:02,750
Finally...

2827
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:03,430
Alright...

2828
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:05,550
The wooden bucket...

2829
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:06,090
Yes...

2830
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:06,390
Alright...

2831
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:07,310
There you go...

2832
01:43:07,310 --> 01:43:08,870
Now I should be able to...

2833
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:20,050
Oh, I have the worms!

2834
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:20,710
Nice.

2835
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:23,170
There are so many worms.

2836
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:27,250
They escaped and are probably wobbling all over Azrim.

2837
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:28,250
That could be useful.

2838
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:30,330
Just pick them up and- Oh wait, what the fuck?

2839
01:43:30,890 --> 01:43:31,670
Holy shit.

2840
01:43:31,850 --> 01:43:33,450
Oh my god, look at these worms.

2841
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:36,730
They look like the worms from the WMD.

2842
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:45,490
Finally, I skipped this part of the game.

2843
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:46,670
Yay, garlic.

2844
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:48,130
They look familiar.

2845
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,310
Yeah, they look very familiar.

2846
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:50,550
Yeah, worms from worms.

2847
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:52,630
Yeah, they look like worms from- Yeah.

2848
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:54,890
Alright guys, I'm gonna call it here.

2849
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,710
Alright, honest opinion.

2850
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:03,590
I think there is definitely- Oh, get the rose brace.

2851
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:08,010
There is definitely- I think this game is about fetch quests, basically.

2852
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:10,750
And like, sometimes I just want a fish.

2853
01:44:11,110 --> 01:44:11,790
I just-

2854
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:19,050
I want a- I want a fish, you know?

2855
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:21,690
And I'm like, I'm tired of fetching quests.

2856
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:22,330
Yeah.

2857
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:25,370
Uh, I think- Okay, it is a chill game.

2858
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:26,270
It's very chill.

2859
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:28,310
Um, it's a very chill game.

2860
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:32,690
Um, I don't know if I can say this is a stream game.

2861
01:44:32,830 --> 01:44:34,910
I can see myself play- Oh wait, the nice worms.

2862
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:38,230
I see myself playing this to pass the time to just relax and chill.

2863
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:50,650
Um, I- I feel like this game also- Um, it is a- I think if you like Viva- Viva La Dirt League, you'll like this game.

2864
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:55,270
Because they have a lot of- a lot of really good inside jokes.

2865
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:57,490
Like, if you like inside jokes- Oh hey, worms.

2866
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:57,910
Nice.

2867
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:06,910
There's a lot of inside jokes that people who like the YouTube channel- Um, Viva La Dirt League would definitely enjoy a lot.

2868
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:09,050
Yeah, it's definitely a Zatsudon game.

2869
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:14,490
So if I'm like doing super chat reading, there's a lot of like Easter eggs to the story.

2870
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:16,330
And like a lot of references and everything.

2871
01:45:17,070 --> 01:45:24,330
Um, so I feel like if you don't watch your channel, you might not be like as into the game as I am right now.

2872
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:27,790
Because there's a lot of funny jokes that I know from the videos themselves.

2873
01:45:28,770 --> 01:45:29,470
Um, yeah.

2874
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:30,990
I just want fish and safe women.

2875
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:32,410
Like that's all I want to do.

2876
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:34,610
I don't want to do your stupid quest, Greg.

2877
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:36,410
I hate your quest, Greg.

2878
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:38,550
Uh, I hate your quest too.

2879
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:47,530
I- Um, but, uh... I definitely- I think it's fun.

2880
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:54,190
I think it's fun, but I can tell that this is definitely not like really, eh- Uh, I didn't even save the- Well, it's TOO BAD!

2881
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:56,430
They keep making me go back and forth.

2882
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:57,950
It's TOO BAD!

2883
01:45:57,950 --> 01:46:00,730
I guess we will never save the woman.

2884
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:07,810
I guess we'll never save her, guys.

2885
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:09,330
That's too bad.

2886
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:12,530
She'll be stuck there forever.

2887
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:14,490
We don't need a saver.

2888
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:17,230
I just want a fish and I got my bucket.

2889
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:18,670
That's all I need.

2890
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:21,770
I got fish and I got bucket.

2891
01:46:22,050 --> 01:46:24,770
It's always a nice day for fishing.

2892
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:27,450
Let me do one more fish.

2893
01:46:28,370 --> 01:46:29,370
Oh, okay.

2894
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:30,130
He doesn't like that.

2895
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:30,430
Okay.

2896
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:32,050
Does anybody like anything?

2897
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:32,750
Yeah.

2898
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:39,270
Not everybody gets a happy end name.

2899
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:42,130
She'll just die, I guess.

2900
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:43,090
Yeah.

2901
01:46:43,870 --> 01:46:44,050
Okay.

2902
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:48,510
Let's at least be able to catch one fish.

2903
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:49,010
Yeah.

2904
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:54,010
Yeah, Tenjin.

2905
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:55,370
It's a nice day for fishing, ain't it?

2906
01:46:58,910 --> 01:47:00,390
But it was fun, though.

2907
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:01,390
I had a great time.

2908
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:03,590
I had a great time trying this game out.

2909
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:07,230
But that's my honest review of this game.

2910
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:13,190
I feel like it's more so of like, you know, just a chatting game to hang out with chat.

2911
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:14,310
Like a super chat.

2912
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:19,010
Maybe if I do like super chat reading, which has been like years since I've done a super chat reading.

2913
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:22,610
I could obviously play this game while I'm reading super chats.

2914
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:26,090
I just all I have to do is just skip the dialogue and just start fishing.

2915
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:28,670
But it's very relaxing game.

2916
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:30,690
I won't say it's a streaming game.

2917
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:32,030
That's what I'll say.

2918
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:35,790
Like in my honest opinion, this game isn't really much of a...

2919
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:38,970
isn't much of a streaming game.

2920
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:43,010
Um, but it's more so of like just a hangout chatting game.

2921
01:47:43,550 --> 01:47:47,110
Um, and but they do have a lot of inside references.

2922
01:47:47,110 --> 01:47:51,190
Like I like that a lot of you guys also like, you know, watch the same channel as me.

2923
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:53,550
So we all like understood the references.

2924
01:47:54,210 --> 01:48:05,110
Um, and uh, and uh, all the like all the, uh, you know, all the little things that they put in their videos that we recognize.

2925
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:07,910
Uh, in like in the game itself.

2926
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:09,670
So yeah, I do appreciate that.

2927
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:10,350
It was nice.

2928
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:11,810
It was a really nice effort.

2929
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:12,430
There's a lot.

2930
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:14,750
I think it definitely was more so a fetch quest.

2931
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:15,870
But I had a great time.

2932
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:16,550
I had a great time.

2933
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:18,370
Um, it's called Viva La Dirt League.

2934
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:20,430
I highly suggest checking the channel out.

2935
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:23,730
It's really, they do some really fun skits.

2936
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:25,670
I love their skits and everything.

2937
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:30,890
And their favorite, my favorite series is, um, the Epic NPC Man.

2938
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:34,770
And, um, what was the other one that I said?

2939
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:38,770
It was Epic NPC Man and the, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2940
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:39,050
Sorry.

2941
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:41,190
I had a very long day.

2942
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:42,630
Today.

2943
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:44,030
I had a very long day.

2944
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:45,430
It started at like 8 a.m.

2945
01:48:45,530 --> 01:48:45,770
So.

2946
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:47,010
And the Blizzard one.

2947
01:48:47,150 --> 01:48:48,170
The Blizzard parody.

2948
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:54,410
Um, so the Epic NPC, Epic NPC series is basically like a parody of World of Warcraft.

2949
01:48:54,410 --> 01:49:00,450
And then, um, and then they made a parody of the developers of the Epic NPC Man Adventures.

2950
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:02,610
Which is like a parody of Blizzard.

2951
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:05,010
And so like, it's like very similar.

2952
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:06,910
Um, so yeah.

2953
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:07,730
I had a great time.

2954
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:08,450
Anyway, guys.

2955
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:09,730
Tomorrow I'll be back home.

2956
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:11,470
Um, so I'll have my actual setup.

2957
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:13,450
And then it'll be back to normal again.

2958
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:16,450
Um, next week there's a lot of stuff to look forward to.

2959
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:17,430
We have a sponsor.

2960
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:19,050
We have a collab next week.

2961
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:19,930
I won't say who yet.

2962
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:23,950
Um, because we're so... I forgot what time... We didn't plan out a time yet.

2963
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:25,490
So I don't want to promise anything.

2964
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,970
Um, since there's no...

2965
01:49:26,970 --> 01:49:29,010
The time hasn't been finalized.

2966
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:31,150
Uh, but it'll be a fun collab.

2967
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:32,910
Um, but yes.

2968
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:36,090
Um, I'm happy to be back home, uh, tomorrow.

2969
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:39,610
Um, and you know, go back to the routine and everything.

2970
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:41,150
I hope you guys still like all these streams.

2971
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:44,070
All these normal, like, random streams in between.

2972
01:49:44,410 --> 01:49:45,630
With the watch-alongs.

2973
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:47,650
Uh, it sucks that they had the watch...

2974
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:49,910
Oh man, the timing was so bad for me.

2975
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:54,370
You know, having the... the game trailer previews when I'm traveling.

2976
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:54,990
Ah!

2977
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:55,950
My god.

2978
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:56,970
I hate that.

2979
01:49:57,230 --> 01:49:58,470
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2980
01:49:58,730 --> 01:49:59,110
You know.

2981
01:49:59,330 --> 01:50:02,190
I mean, nice to have watched it, you know, on my actual setup.

2982
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:04,230
But, uh, but it was still really fun.

2983
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,390
I had a great time watching.

2984
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:07,310
Uh...

2985
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:08,290
Uh...

2986
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:09,110
Watching...

2987
01:50:09,110 --> 01:50:09,830
Watching it all.

2988
01:50:10,050 --> 01:50:10,410
Anyway.

2989
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:11,710
As always, everybody.

2990
01:50:11,910 --> 01:50:12,730
Stay hydrated.

2991
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:13,510
Posture check.

2992
01:50:14,130 --> 01:50:14,570
Uh...

2993
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:16,710
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2994
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:17,350
And if you...

2995
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:18,050
Stay up for me.

2996
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:18,910
Head to bed.

2997
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:19,490
Cause...

2998
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:20,330
You deserve it.

2999
01:50:20,510 --> 01:50:21,710
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3000
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:22,790
Bye, guys.

3001
01:50:23,470 --> 01:50:23,870
Bye!

3002
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:24,650
Bye!

3003
01:50:24,890 --> 01:50:24,910
Bye!
