1
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,460
Hello, oh fuck.

2
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,480
Okay, sorry, ignored the text.

3
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,740
Um, hello, give me a sec.

4
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,080
Oh, I hear myself.

5
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,960
Oh my god.

6
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,720
Okay, sorry.

7
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,460
Um, I'm a little dead inside as you guys can tell already.

8
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,220
You're gonna listen, you're gonna hear why I've been a little dead inside any minute now.

9
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,340
This little fucker.

10
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,280
Okay, Ducky Averdige has been a little- oh, there he goes.

11
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,680
Very fucking good.

12
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,840
I'm having my little- my lunch.

13
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,960
My lunch right now.

14
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,920
Yes, I'm having my lunch right now.

15
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,800
Okay, oh my god.

16
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,120
Please.

17
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,840
Okay, I love him.

18
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,680
I love him.

19
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,860
I love him so much.

20
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,980
He is the love- he is the love.

21
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,080
I love him.

22
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,280
He has done nothing wrong.

23
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,840
I love him so much.

24
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,460
I'm- I'm gonna freak out.

25
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,180
Okay, I love- I love you!

26
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,960
Okay, anyway.

27
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm sorry, guys.

28
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,720
Okay, um.

29
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,700
I have to do- deal with this.

30
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,340
I had a chance to sleep for- I had a chance to sleep for 40 minutes and then

31
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:30,410
this fucker- I love you, but like- Oh my god.

32
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,730
Last week- oh my god.

33
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,190
I- I swear- I'm gonna get it.

34
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,290
I will get the collar.

35
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:51,370
I will get- I don't turn it on but he freaks out about it because it's- he has like PTSD from when he was younger because like it was really bad when he was a lot younger.

36
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,170
It was really bad.

37
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,150
So like I don't turn it on but he gets PTSD and I will get that.

38
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,990
I will get it.

39
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,790
I will fucking get it.

40
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,690
I- okay.

41
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,130
Okay, oh he knows.

42
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,930
Fucking better know.

43
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,090
Oh my god.

44
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,810
Anyway, so I'm sorry.

45
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm sorry for being late today.

46
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:37,610
I had 40 minutes to nap before this stream and I was like, that's all right.

47
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,290
I can deal with 40 minutes.

48
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,270
This- oh.

49
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm gonna grab it.

50
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,770
I'll be right back.

51
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I still want to eat my food.

52
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,220
I'll be right back.

53
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,060
I gave you a warning.

54
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,780
You had a warning.

55
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,320
Okay.

56
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,580
All right.

57
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,840
Hello, everybody.

58
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,480
I am fighting back.

59
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,340
It's okay.

60
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,160
So I was like, I have 40 minutes.

61
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,300
He's not back yet but like I have the collar on my desk.

62
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,100
Just- oh.

63
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,440
Oh, you see that?

64
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,140
That's right.

65
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,460
Turn around.

66
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,620
Okay.

67
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,060
Oh, you see this?

68
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,820
Oh, that's right.

69
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Turn around.

70
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,520
Yeah.

71
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,160
Walk away.

72
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,020
Oh, yeah.

73
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,880
Walk away.

74
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,320
Okay.

75
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,380
All right.

76
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,240
He walked away.

77
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,580
Yeah.

78
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,040
Anyway, so.

79
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,560
So, um, I was like, okay.

80
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,720
I have 40 minutes before, um, before the stream.

81
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,100
I was like, I can't be that- I can- I can take that nap.

82
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,280
I'm- I've napped worst hours.

83
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,140
So I was like, I'll be fine.

84
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,800
There's 40 minutes.

85
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,340
By the way, this is like my first meal.

86
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,640
That's what I'm eating right now.

87
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm so tired.

88
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,640
I didn't get to eat before my first stream.

89
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,580
I just went straight to bed.

90
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,160
So this is my first meal and I'm- I just basically cut some bread.

91
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,680
And with some brie cheese right now.

92
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,620
So this is like my snack before my actual meal.

93
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,300
So.

94
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,850
So.

95
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,270
I was like, that's fine.

96
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:11,250
And then for 30 minutes straight,

97
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,150
Doki Amber Doge was like, you know what?

98
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,890
I've been able to push my boundaries the last week.

99
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:39,490
So maybe I can make her feed me two hours early than his regular feeding time.

100
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,570
Two hours early.

101
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:52,070
And I was like, no, you are not getting food early.

102
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,110
I'm- I'm gonna sleep.

103
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:05,400
And he was like, bet one of us will fold.

104
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:24,780
And it was me because I did not expect him to bark for 30 minutes straight while I was in bed.

105
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,620
And he would just- he would bark beside the bed.

106
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,940
He would bark at the door, like the door to the bedroom.

107
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,400
And he's like, one of us will break down and it's not gonna be me.

108
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,780
And he was right.

109
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,960
He was so right.

110
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,900
I- I was like, he'll get tired.

111
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,700
He'll- Eventually he'll get tired.

112
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,080
There's no way.

113
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:12,080
Because like, if you guys didn't know, if you guys didn't know, in- for dog training, you're supposed to like, just let them bark themselves out until they're tired.

114
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:21,080
So like, because you want to like, establish the fact that like, you know, they can't get like, they couldn't- they- oh, I did.

115
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,700
I- I like, hold- held it.

116
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,140
Like, I- I threw in the collar, but he didn't care at that point.

117
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,300
He was like, I'm hungry!

118
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,780
Now he's like, you know what?

119
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm not that hungry.

120
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,860
So that's why it's working now.

121
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,440
Because he's like, oh, you're right.

122
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm not really that hungry.

123
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,600
But that- back then, he was like, I'm willing to risk it all.

124
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,580
I'm- I'm willing to risk it all.

125
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,660
I don't care if you held that collar in front of me.

126
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:55,280
And so, you're supposed to let them bark until like, they- they realize they can't get anything out of it.

127
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,360
So I tried to do that, you know.

128
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,200
I tried- I was like, it's fine.

129
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,900
I- I- it's fine.

130
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,220
I'll just let him bark until he realized that he can't just demand anything he wants by just barking.

131
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,560
And he did it for 30 minutes straight.

132
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,340
He did it for 30 minutes straight.

133
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,900
And by the time he was done, I realized it was 440.

134
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,780
I realized it was 440.

135
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,800
Or like, no, it wasn't 4- I realized it was 445.

136
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,140
And I was like, oh.

137
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:47,040
I was like, I can't- I can't- you win.

138
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,500
You fucking won.

139
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,160
I can't- I can't do this any longer.

140
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,400
You won.

141
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,540
And so, the moment I got up, he knew he won too.

142
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,960
He knew.

143
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:13,400
I got up, and I was like, I got up, and then- and then- and then he was like, ha ha ha.

144
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,800
He was so happy, excited.

145
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,660
He's like, yeah!

146
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,020
And he did like a victory lap around me.

147
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,640
He was like, just running- like, he- he was just running around, and he's like, yeah!

148
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,740
Woo woo yeah!

149
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:38,940
And he did- and I just- I just slowly walked over to the food, and gave him his food, and he knew that- that fucker knew he won.

150
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,080
Oh my god.

151
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,960
That's why I'm messaging chat.

152
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,840
I was like, guys, I need 30 more minutes to nap.

153
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,840
I'm so sorry.

154
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,420
I- I'm so sorry.

155
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,220
He won.

156
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:14,700
Guys, you don't under- the- the worst part is- is that wiener dogs have the loudest barks out of like, all dogs.

157
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,300
They're like, the top five loudest barks, like, in the world.

158
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:29,020
And like, I would have been fine if he was any other dog, but he's so loud.

159
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,560
He's so loud.

160
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,420
You can't sleep through it.

161
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,180
You can't.

162
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,800
Oh my god, they're so tiny, but so very loud.

163
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,540
You have to listen to that.

164
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,520
I don't care if my neighbors heard that.

165
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,520
I- I'm sorry to my neighbors that had to listen to that for 30 minutes.

166
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,500
I'm sorry.

167
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,100
I just- I try to teach him, but he taught me.

168
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,020
He fucking taught me, guys.

169
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,080
So yeah, um, that's why I'm late.

170
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,780
I'm sorry.

171
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,080
I'm sorry for being late.

172
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:32,280
I- I really needed that extra sleep, um, because like, they weren't- for those who are not members- oh, he's coming back.

173
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,740
He's coming back.

174
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,780
Oh, see this?

175
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,980
That's right.

176
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,220
You see this?

177
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,560
Walk away.

178
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,860
Walk away.

179
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm not done eating.

180
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,780
I'm not done eating.

181
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,580
He walked away.

182
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,880
Get back.

183
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,200
He's underneath my desk now.

184
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,460
He's looking at me.

185
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,680
Oh my god.

186
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,180
He did nothing wrong.

187
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,320
I hope one day you own a wiener dog.

188
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:32,320
I hope- I hope one day- I hope one day you get a wiener dog.

189
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,300
Okay, here's a fun fact about wiener dogs.

190
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,360
They're very bratty.

191
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,760
They're very bratty.

192
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:52,180
They have a lot of personality and like- Like, they get what they- they- they know what they want and they get it.

193
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:01,540
They have- oh my god, they're- they have like one of the biggest personalities out there.

194
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,720
We're such a tiny little man.

195
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,180
They're so fucking tiny, but they're like, I might be tiny, but I'm the leader of this pack.

196
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,780
So like, he knows and he knows it.

197
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
He fucking knows it.

198
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,280
Alright guys, I'm almost done with my food.

199
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,580
I'm almost done.

200
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,140
Look at that.

201
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,540
He's been so quiet.

202
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,480
He's been so quiet ever since I showed him the collar.

203
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,460
I just gotta give him a little trauma for some peace and quiet.

204
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,400
Just a little bit.

205
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,200
He knows.

206
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,580
He fucking- yeah.

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,860

225
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,620
I saw someone's chat was like you should get Oh, you should totally get two.

226
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:49,300
I always thought about getting two dogs But then if I get two dogs And they're both like this.

227
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,060
I Know I won't have a life anymore so

228
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:05,170
It will become their life I would merely exist for them

229
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,240

00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,680
Oh Oh, you're getting a little confident now, aren't you?

232
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,860

239
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,080
I Don't know where you got the idea that we're playing God

240
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,560
I'm joking.

241
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,180
I'm joking.

242
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,720
I'm really I've got a word I'm Hey,

243
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,600
yeah All right now now we have the real game

244
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,960
Hey Marvel rivals update dope for like twitch rivals.

245
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,440
So you guys didn't know.

246
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,820
Um, I talked about it during the member stream.

247
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:26,860
I talked about during the member stream and Um the Marvel rivals twitch rivals will be Saturday like literally next Saturday on the 18th.

248
00:21:26,880 --> 00:22:11,980
So it's actually really close by and we're gonna be like we're trying to min-max our team Because we really want to get to the finals So our team is basically three people from Um the from the from the second place team of the Marvel rivals Tournament and it's gonna be me me super Gomez hogs and Ry amazing and those three are actually in the same team together for and they won like first place in several other tournaments for my Rivals and they won like they got second place for the recent ones.

249
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:23,660
So What are Cuz we're only allowed maximum four players or above Diamond so it was me.

250
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,780
It was a very hard decision because I got to pick the entire team.

251
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:50,960
So So I get to pick whichever like which one I can get from the entire team and it was a very hard decision but I decided to pick up two of the DPS players because I was like Because I was either like I picked two supports two DPS two supports one DPS or one tank or Two tanks one DPS and one support Alright,

252
00:22:51,220 --> 00:23:24,280
or I mean sorry two tanks or one DPS or like one two supports one deep one DPS and one tank I decided to do two DPS one tank and and me so I was like You guys got kill everything before they kill us DPS I was like you have to kill everything because if you don't My support partner and I will get heavily targeted because of it

253
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,120
So I went in with the killed faster strap

254
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:44,640
Because I was like, it doesn't matter if we have good support, because if we have good supports, but our DPS doesn't pick up the slack, it wouldn't matter.

255
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,180
Like, we're just making the fights longer.

256
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:55,120
Anyway, so, we can only have four... we can only have four... one above all... like, above Diamond players.

257
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,460
So, obviously, like, Diamond or above.

258
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:03,160
So, obviously, I picked three... like, including me, I'm included in that maximum.

259
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,540
I would pick three players who are the highest rank possible.

260
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,720
Because, like, why would I pick a Diamond player, when I could pick, like, an actual, like, pro player?

261
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:30,080
Anyway, and our fifth player from your suggestions chat... this was actually suggested in the member stream, so you guys gotta congratulate the member goons for suggesting them.

262
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,640
Is that our fifth player is gonna be Kony.

263
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,640
Who's gonna be our other tank player.

264
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,940
So, Kony's joining us, because he's plat, apparently.

265
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,060
I thank fucking God.

266
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,520
And I was, like, asking Kony, I was like, what rank are you?

267
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,600
And he's like, I got to plat, but I stopped playing, because, like, I didn't care.

268
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,680
I just wanted the rewards.

269
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,240
I was like, thank fucking God you stopped playing, Kony.

270
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,180
You're my... you're my scam pointer right there.

271
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,860
You're my actual smurf right there, thank fucking God.

272
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:15,760
So, Kony was, like, super excited, because he was like, I'm gonna grind all week for the... I'm gonna do it.

273
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,840
I'm gonna grind all week, and then he's gonna get additional coaching from Hogs.

274
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:31,180
So, like, Hogs is gonna, like, the other tank is gonna coach him, and, like, improve the synergy with each other, so they can, like, work together for the tournament.

275
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,380
Because it's gonna be a two-day tournament, guys.

276
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,900
The Twitch Rivals is gonna be, like, two days.

277
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,640
So, um, so, like, we... I just really want to do well.

278
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,340
Like, I just... I just really want... I want to beat Shroud.

279
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,640
That's... I don't think I'm gonna beat him.

280
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,260
I want to meet him at the finals.

281
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,480
That's all I want.

282
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,660
I want to... I want to meet him in the finals, guys.

283
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,660
I don't think I'm gonna beat Shroud.

284
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,260
I just want to... I just want to see him there.

285
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,600
Beat two of Shroud versus... He doesn't even know my existence.

286
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,500
He's like, who is this... who is this streamer that's trying to start beef with me?

287
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:26,560
Who is this, like, um... who is this, like, not, like, um... um... not important, irrelevant streamer that's trying to start shit right now?

288
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,640
Anyway, so that's basically the gist of everything.

289
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,080
Um, uh, uh, so, uh, that's gonna be... that's basically it.

290
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,600
The tournament's gonna be on the 18th.

291
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,180
Uh, I'm still trying to find one more support player.

292
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,300
Um, and then our team's gonna be full.

293
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,420
Like, we finalized the entire team.

294
00:26:53,420 --> 00:27:03,640
So, I need to find one more support player that's plat and under, but it's very difficult because if that support... I would get really mad if this support tilts me.

295
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,400
Because, like, nothing makes me more mad than a bad support player.

296
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,820
Because, like, I'm like... I actually get really mad.

297
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,680
Because I'm like... I'd be like, why?

298
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,020
Just why?

299
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:37,960
So, um, I'll be like, I wish I could just clone myself so I don't have to deal with it.

300
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,040
Alright, anyway.

301
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,760
So, yeah.

302
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,800
So, it's gonna be really tough trying to find the sixth player.

303
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:53,420
Um, I'm... I'd rather... because, like, it's worse for me when I see a bad support player because I'm a support player.

304
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,080
So, I know what they're doing is, like, so wrong if they do something wrong.

305
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,480
And I know, like, it's such an easy fix to me.

306
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,340
And also, guys, I'm gonna... I'm trying to find people that are in NA because of ping.

307
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:14,780
Um, the ping... uh, the ping diff in, like, Marble Rivals actually hurts so much.

308
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,320
Like, you guys saw me play with 200 ping.

309
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,440
It was... yeah.

310
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,920
So, I'm gonna... I'm trying to find people in NA.

311
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,180
You really need a good ping for it.

312
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,720
Uh, but anyway.

313
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,840
That's the Marble Rivals update.

314
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,320
I already told the members these.

315
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,160
So, but yeah.

316
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
Um, you guys gotta thank the member goons.

317
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:52,160
Uh, for suggesting, uh, Kony to be part of the team because he was super down for it and was, like, really excited.

318
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,680
Like, he was, like, oh my god, like, now that I have a goal, I'm gonna hard grind Marble Rivals.

319
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,180
Um, and, like, see how far we're gonna get.

320
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,900
Because, yeah, so that makes me super excited because I think Kony has a lot of potential to be, like, really, really good at the game.

321
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,400
And he's also, like, super vibey and, like, really funny too.

322
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,820
So, I'm very excited, uh, for the team in general.

323
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,120
And the pro players I picked up to be part of my team is also, like, because I played with them.

324
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,720
And they're, like, incredibly, like, you know, they're really funny people.

325
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,980
So, I'm very excited.

326
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,600
Um, anyway.

327
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,160
God of War!

328
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,780
I need to plug in my controller.

329
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,520
Oh, no, where's the controller?

330
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,280
Oh, guys, I talk too much.

331
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,180
I don't know how I did it.

332
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,140
I didn't prepare the most important thing.

333
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,400
Where's my controller?

334
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,060
There you see.

335
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,540
I used a PlayStation controller, right?

336
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,080
Is that it?

337
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,280
Where is it?

338
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,980
Where did I put the controller?

339
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,880
Did I use a PlayStation controller?

340
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,980
Or was it...

341
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,840
Or was it an Xbox controller?

342
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,700
Because there's an Xbox controller here.

343
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,080
But where's my PlayStation controller?

344
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,160
Oh, no, guys.

345
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,640
Any Vine viewers?

346
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,460
Um, it's been so long.

347
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,000
Wait, where is my PlayStation controller?

348
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
Where the fuck is it?

349
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,120
Oh, my God.

350
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,440
Guys, this is not good.

351
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,740
I actually don't know where my PlayStation controller went.

352
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,200
It can't be far.

353
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,160
There's no way.

354
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,480
It can't be far because where would I put it?

355
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,460
Does she know?

356
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,360
Oh, my God.

357
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,980
Wait, guys, I need to...

358
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,120
Guys, we have a problem.

359
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,700
I don't know.

360
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,140
Where's my PlayStation controller?

361
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,180
Oh, my God.

362
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,140
I literally...

363
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,040
We have everything fucked all over there.

364
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,960
Oh, my God.

365
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,640
Where is it?

366
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:58,880
What?

367
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,340
Where could I put it?

368
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,560
Was it PlayStation or was it Xbox?

369
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,600
I don't remember.

370
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,320
I need you guys to remind me.

371
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,700
My brain has not...

372
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,660
I don't remember previous streams sometimes.

373
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,940
Like, I do remember, but, like, not which controller I used.

374
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,660
It was PlayStation?

375
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:19,820
Yeah.

376
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,920
How the fuck did I put my PlayStation controller?

377
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,760
Okay, that's not it.

378
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh, my God.

379
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,140
The one issue we have.

380
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,210
It was almost perfect.

381
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,390
But we were just missing the PlayStation controller.

382
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,870
Oh, it's over here.

383
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,050
Why did I put it back here?

384
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,430
All right.

385
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,310
Oh, shit.

386
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,370
Okay, I found it.

387
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,910
I found it.

388
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,530
Oh, my God.

389
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,750
It's okay, guys.

390
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,310
I found it, everyone.

391
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,530
DarkBlade, thank you for the super chat.

392
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,310
Thank you, thank you.

393
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,250
I'm so happy I suggested Kony.

394
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,150
I love you, too, and your collab so much.

395
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,310
Thank you for the super chat, DarkBlade.

396
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,250
Thank you, thank you.

397
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,370
I really appreciate it.

398
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:06,870
Yeah.

399
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,930
Thank you guys for telling me he was a plat tank player.

400
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,810
I legitimately thought tank would be the hardest to find.

401
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:13,850
Because, like...

402
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,290
Getting a good tank is, like, really difficult.

403
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,450
Because, like, they're so rare.

404
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,390
But, like, getting a support player is a lot easier than finding a tank player.

405
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,310
Like, a low-rank tank player.

406
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,330
So, thanks, guys.

407
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,070
All right, I need to restart the game, because...

408
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,710
It doesn't recognize the controller right now.

409
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,870
Yay!

410
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,290
All right, restarting my game.

411
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,510
Um...

412
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,650
New, thank you for the super chat.

413
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,530
Thank you, thank you.

414
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,370
Such a shame you don't find your controller.

415
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,410
I guess we need to switch to Marvel Rivals.

416
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,490
Guys, life is not just about Marvel Rivals.

417
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,910
I swear to God, guys.

418
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,450
There's more to life than just Marvel Rivals.

419
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,570
Guys, I swear there's more to life than just Marvel Rivals.

420
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,550
I swear to God.

421
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,330
Guys...

422
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,230
I swear...

423
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,470
I'm more than just Marvel Rivals.

424
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,950
Okay, continue.

425
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:16,890
Um...

426
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,390
Where was I?

427
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,870
Has to be this one.

428
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,710
This is the most recent.

429
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,950
All right.

430
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,890
Here we go.

431
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,840
This is it.

432
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,790
All right.

433
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,290
I don't rem...

434
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,350
Where did I leave off?

435
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,370
I do remember, but I also don't remember at the same time.

436
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,890
Oh, do I have...

437
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,930
Oh, I have new stuff!

438
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,810
Oh my God, I need to upgrade my stuff.

439
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,150
I feel so weak inside right now.

440
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,790
Okay, a momentum from...

441
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,730
Uh...

442
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,210
Defense.

443
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,830
Uh...

444
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,750
No, that's fine.

445
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,750
And then, does my son have better clothes?

446
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,930
No, he does not.

447
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,250
That's okay.

448
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:03,850
That's...

449
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,850
That's okay, son.

450
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,350
You don't need better clothes.

451
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,570
All right, we gotta upgrade our...

452
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,050
We gotta upgrade our son.

453
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:10,610
All right, son.

454
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,950
I'm going all in on you.

455
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,890
All right, son?

456
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,710
You're gonna get everything in the world.

457
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,190
All right, nice.

458
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,770
I don't know what I'm upgrading.

459
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,390
I know...

460
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,170
I'm pretty sure you guys are yelling at me about the upgrades, but like, that's okay.

461
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:29,770
All right.

462
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,130
I invested so much money on my son.

463
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,410
He better repay me.

464
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:43,690
And then when I get old, he will fucking take care of me when I'm older.

465
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,710
Right, son?

466
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,410
You won't fuck this up, right?

467
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,710
No, I just fixed the audio.

468
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:52,490
Don't worry.

469
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,550
He's not gonna fuck this up.

470
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,170
He knows.

471
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,330
He knows I paid for your college.

472
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,610
You're gonna pay me back, right, boy?

473
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:02,830
Right?

474
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,250
Okay, let's grab this.

475
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,630
All right, boy.

476
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,750
Where do I go, boy?

477
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:14,870
Oh wait, I should like...

478
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,930
See if I can spend some money.

479
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,310
Take care of me when I grow up, boy.

480
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,610
What?

481
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,950
Oh shit, sorry.

482
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,490
I had to tab out real quick.

483
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:35,810
What?

484
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,650
What are you gonna make?

485
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:39,930
Oh!

486
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,590
I could make better weapons.

487
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,010
All right.

488
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,550
My bow can be upgraded.

489
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,190
Okay.

490
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,130
Okay, talent bow.

491
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,250
All right, boy!

492
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,950
It's time!

493
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,890
You're going to university whether you like it or not, boy.

494
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,390
So you can get a good job and take care of me when I'm older.

495
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,490
That's fucking right.

496
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,010
All right, and then I'll upgrade your quiver.

497
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,710
Got your quiver upgrade.

498
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,530
And I'll make sure you go to college.

499
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,750
I will make sure.

500
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,590
I don't know if I should upgrade armor.

501
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,850
I feel like it's such a waste in general upgrading my armor.

502
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,690
Because I always feel like I'm going to find better armor later.

503
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,810
Boy, you will become a doctor and lawyer.

504
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,310
I swear to God.

505
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,430
Do you want me to remind you how much money I have spent on you, boy?

506
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,310
Do you?

507
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,210
Do you remember, boy?

508
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,470
What is the point of knowing how to read or write if you're not going to become a fucking doctor?

509
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,310
All right.

510
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,910
Here we go.

511
00:36:59,650 --> 00:36:59,970
Yes.

512
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,250
Where do I go?

513
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:02,790
Is it here?

514
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,560
Where the fuck do I go?

515
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,800
Where did I come from?

516
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Oh, here.

517
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,060
Wait, no, I remember I climbed up here.

518
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,400
But...

519
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,060
Okay, it's this way.

520
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,740
Is it this way?

521
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,680
It's yellow.

522
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,480
But it's yellow.

523
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,120
Is this not it?

524
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,220
Kudo, right?

525
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,000
Can't jump down.

526
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,780
Oh, fucking... Okay, sorry.

527
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,980
There we go.

528
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,220
Wait, how do I...

529
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,920
How do I grab it back?

530
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,160
Oh.

531
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:55,980
Okay.

532
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,820
Okay, boy.

533
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,620
Boy, sorry.

534
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,460
I'm like...

535
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,280
Boy, sorry.

536
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,920
I need to remember how to play this game.

537
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,880
How do I grab it back?

538
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,300
Oh, there it goes.

539
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,940
It's triangle.

540
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,040
Do I need to do another one?

541
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,880
Is this not done yet?

542
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,840
Boy, did you do it, boy?

543
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:18,940
Boy?

544
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,480
What did I do?

545
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,790
What did I...

546
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,430
Boy, what did I... Boy, explain.

547
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,890
Oh, it's over there.

548
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:30,710
Thanks, boy.

549
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,370
Thanks, boy, for explaining.

550
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,790
Your old man appreciates it.

551
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,630
See, that's...

552
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,430
See, and this is exactly why... Oh my god.

553
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:47,970
Alright, boy.

554
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:49,950
That's right.

555
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,230
Good job, boy!

556
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,730
Good job!

557
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,010
That's right.

558
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,850
That's what my millions of dollars of investment was worth... was for.

559
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,590
Okay, now how do I get over there?

560
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,790
Alright, circle.

561
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,570
There we go.

562
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,470
Good job.

563
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:11,690
Circle.

564
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,330
Yes, boy.

565
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,370
I learned how to jump.

566
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:19,530
Yup.

567
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,230
Circle time!

568
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,370
Good shooting.

569
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,210
Oh, that looks like a bad person.

570
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,610
That's right.

571
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,870
Watch this, boy!

572
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,590
I'm a little concerned that he's not taking damage, my boy.

573
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,210
Why is he slowly walking up to me?

574
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,810
Why is he...

575
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:46,990
Boy?

576
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,030
Boy!

577
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,250
Boy, I'm... Oh, shit!

578
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,310
Boy.

579
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,170
I don't feel so good, boy.

580
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:56,950
I...

581
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,870
I don't feel so good.

582
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,190
It's okay.

583
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,390
I got this.

584
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,770
And I got this.

585
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,050
Oh, shit!

586
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,350
Okay.

587
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,930
Okay, nevermind.

588
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,470
Okay, but like, that was pretty sick, though.

589
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,430
Was that not?

590
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,770
With the ability?

591
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,130
Oh my god, please.

592
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,190
Learn how to aim.

593
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,530
I really...

594
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,310
I really need you to learn how to aim.

595
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:24,950
Oh, shit!

596
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,190
Okay.

597
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,990
Oh, oh, it's alright.

598
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:29,910
That's alright.

599
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,210
That's not okay.

600
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,130
That's...

601
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,150
Oh my god!

602
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:36,650
Bro!

603
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,030
This is a 1v1!

604
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,630
The boy is just an accessory, so it doesn't count.

605
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,410
Okay.

606
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,230
Oh!

607
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,430
There you go.

608
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,930
That's fine.

609
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:52,530
Swing!

610
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,710
Swing!

611
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,930
No, I'm not!

612
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,900
Please!

613
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,700
He's one!

614
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:06,780
Boy, please!

615
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,680
He's one!

616
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,840
Just shoot him one time!

617
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,400
Oh, not even hard.

618
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,180
Not even close, guys.

619
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,060
Not even fucking close.

620
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,520
So easy.

621
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,260
Flawless victory.

622
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

623
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,600
I was like...

624
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,780
You saw that red HP?

625
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,980
It was like red...

626
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,660
It was not actually red HP.

627
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,360
It was like my second bar.

628
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,920
Is that it?

629
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,960
Oh!

630
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,360
I could have pushed this here.

631
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,920
Oh, hey.

632
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,660
There's a HP thing over there.

633
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,040
Okay.

634
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,800
Nice.

635
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,780
Wait, can I climb up this?

636
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,380
If I move that?

637
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,420
I feel like I could move this somewhere.

638
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,800
Right?

639
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,200
Okay, I'm just pushing it back.

640
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,400
I don't know.

641
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,200
I feel like I could move this somewhere.

642
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,200
But where do I move?

643
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,660
Oh!

644
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,700
It was all the way behind me.

645
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,780
Okay, I figured it out.

646
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,580
I figured it out.

647
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,600
I don't need no help.

648
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,120
I'm a gamer.

649
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,020
Alright,

650
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,790
nice.

651
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,910
I got a hack silver, whatever that is.

652
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,290
Oh wait, no.

653
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:57,890
I got money.

654
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,050
And I got HP.

655
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,330
And...

656
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,270
Yeah, go this way.

657
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,550
I'm not tired.

658
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,710
I'm at my second win.

659
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:12,990
Rip me, boy.

660
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,410
Or you will fall to your death.

661
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,150
I think we go down, right?

662
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,650
Okay, yeah, we do.

663
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,250
And then...

664
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,510
Okay, we go right side.

665
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:26,830
And...

666
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:27,670
Where else do we have to go?

667
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:28,730
Up?

668
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:29,490
Up.

669
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:31,930
Uh...

670
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:32,470
Left?

671
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:33,370
No?

672
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,210
Oh, right.

673
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,090
I see the yellow paint, guys.

674
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:40,970
I see the vision.

675
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,950
I see the vision.

676
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,650
What happens?

677
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,230
Yeah, what now?

678
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,930
Can I do it?

679
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,590
Wait, what?

680
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,030
Oh!

681
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,650
Alright, shoot it!

682
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,490
Nice.

683
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,430
Simple geometry.

684
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,290
What do you mean, what?

685
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,110
Did I not do it?

686
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,950
Alright, do it again, boy!

687
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,450
Do it again!

688
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,230
Oh, that's right!

689
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,640
Simple geometry and physics.

690
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,120
I almost failed math.

691
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,260
But that's what my boy investment is for.

692
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,120
Alright.

693
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,200
Oh, there's another one.

694
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:41,840
Right here.

695
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,620
Uh...

696
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,880
I wonder what happens if I shoot it now.

697
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,760
What are you doing?

698
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,240
What?

699
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:51,860
Shoot!

700
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:52,600
What?

701
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,560
Oh my god, shoot!

702
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,420
Boy!

703
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,920
Boy, it's right- Oh my god, do I have to push you?

704
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,240
Do I have to push you?

705
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:02,780
Boy!

706
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,620
Why aren't you shoot- Okay.

707
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,560
Oh my god, boy, please.

708
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,920
Why aren't you shooting?

709
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,640
Can I not back up?

710
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,300
I just go up?

711
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,200
Oh, I just go up.

712
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:27,820
Okay.

713
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,300
That's right, I definitely knew it too, boy.

714
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,460
That's fucking right.

715
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,780
I knew exactly what to do.

716
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:10,760
Boy.

717
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,540
I didn't work.

718
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,760
9 to 5.

719
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,380
Every day.

720
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,900
So you can ask stupid questions.

721
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,720
Anyway, let's go.

722
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,940
That's it, that's all I'm gonna say.

723
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,860
Alright, let's see.

724
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:34,860
Up...

725
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,920
Then...

726
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,860
Wait, what's that sound?

727
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,500
What was that?

728
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,560
Right, thank you for the very first super chat.

729
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,460
Thank you, thank you.

730
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,840
Okay,

731
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,320
I just...

732
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,760
Sorry, okay.

733
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,440
I should've read that in my head.

734
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,320
Thank you for the super chat.

735
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,040
Thank you, thank you.

736
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,480
XBread, thank you for the super chat.

737
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,860
Thank you, thank you.

738
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,320
Well,

739
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,260
I don't think like this one yet.

740
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,200
Because he still took care of the boy.

741
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,380
He still took care of him.

742
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,800
It's just tough love, you know?

743
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,960
He's like one of those dads who are like...

744
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,420
You must never show emotion, boy.

745
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,260
Or you're fucking weak.

746
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,300
Do not cry, boy.

747
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,480
Keep your emotions inside.

748
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,700
You know, that type of dad.

749
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,120
I will let no boy of mine practice magic.

750
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,200
Alright, cool.

751
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,900
That type, yeah.

752
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,720
But he's still there.

753
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,520
He's still there.

754
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,640
He just doesn't know how to raise a child properly.

755
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,980
Because I'm pretty sure...

756
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,740
It's like a cycle where...

757
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,980
Strength, Runic Defense.

758
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,040
Where it's basically like...

759
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,840
His dad raised him like this.

760
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,980
So he's gonna raise him like it too.

761
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,980
Because look at him.

762
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,420
Now he's a man!

763
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,680
Now look at me, freedom nipple.

764
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,440
And thus you shall become just like me.

765
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,660
My dad was raised like this.

766
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,440
And his father's father was raised like this.

767
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,500
And you shall be raised like this too, boy.

768
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,740
And that's why you shall not be using magic like a fucking...

769
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,940
I'm trying to think of what's like pathetic.

770
00:48:59,260 --> 00:48:59,700
Like...

771
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,400
HAHAHAHA That's why you shall not be raised with magic, boy.

772
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,460
You're not gonna be like those weak boys out there.

773
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,460
Who practices ballet.

774
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:20,500
That's like...

775
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,680
That's like Kratos singing.

776
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,320
That's not what like I think, guys.

777
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,240
Like a...

778
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,700
Like an elf, you're right.

779
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,940
Like a fucking elf.

780
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,740
Are you an elf, boy?

781
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,520
Or are you a man?

782
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:36,900
Sure.

783
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,540
I'm roleplaying, guys.

784
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,100
It's not actually how I feel, guys.

785
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:41,920
I just need you guys.

786
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,460
This is all roleplay, guys.

787
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,980
This is all roleplay.

788
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,280
I need you to know that.

789
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,420
Crawl through this hole.

790
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,000
Guys, I need you to know this is all roleplay.

791
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,720
What does it say?

792
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,920
When time itself is deserted, the

793
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,830
forms...

794
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:10,350
Those symbols?

795
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:11,690
The seasons?

796
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,170
Yeah, but the order's all jumbled.

797
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,630
It's gonna be winter, spring, summer, autumn?

798
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:19,430
Why is there two winter?

799
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,490
It's from a song Mother used to sing.

800
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:23,370
Do I know that one?

801
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,590
Winter like...

802
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:26,710
Quiet head.

803
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,490
Doesn't like music either.

804
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:29,690
Got it.

805
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:29,990
What?

806
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:31,510
Oh!

807
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,950
Okay, winter.

808
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:35,950
Spring.

809
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:37,070
Summer.

810
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:40,790
Summer.

811
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:42,550
Autumn!

812
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:46,610
Okay, that's not autumn.

813
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:47,650
Autumn!

814
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:48,970
There you go.

815
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,870
Sing the song!

816
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,300
Do it, boy!

817
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,040
Sing me a song right now!

818
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,100
Your mother's dead!

819
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,320
What?

820
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:07,840
What?

821
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,120
Winter, spring, summer, autumn.

822
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,360
Oh, fuck!

823
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,220
I had to do it backwards.

824
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,460
Okay, I figured it out.

825
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,400
Winter.

826
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,560
Spring.

827
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,560
Oh, wait.

828
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,340
Sorry, Jake.

829
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,620
I pressed...

830
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,260
Okay, sorry.

831
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,860
I actually pressed square.

832
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,380
Alright, summer.

833
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:40,840
Summer.

834
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,400
I like how you guys like, preemptively said, well done.

835
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,060
Like...

836
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,780
You're like, well done, Doki!

837
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,920
As I got it wrong again.

838
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,960
There we go.

839
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,300
Now you guys can say good job.

840
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,960
Good job, Doki.

841
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,560
Solo.

842
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,360
It means endure.

843
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,800
Try it.

844
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:10,720
Solo.

845
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,460
Oh my god, there's an earthquake.

846
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,740
What's going on?

847
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:16,640
Whoa!

848
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:19,980
Oh my god, we did it!

849
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,380
I did it.

850
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,760
Move aside, boy.

851
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,440
I did this.

852
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,160
I paid for his education, so I get to take credit for it.

853
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,100
Keep writing.

854
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,660
Solo.

855
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,140
Right, boy!

856
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:33,780
Right!

857
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,020
I spent a million dollars on this private school education.

858
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,360
Now, fucking right!

859
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,700
Yeah.

860
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,140
Oh, that sounds bad.

861
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,740
Oh, it's like an elevator.

862
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,600
Am I gonna get, like, granite?

863
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,860
Oh, I'm gonna get ran at.

864
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,000
That's alright.

865
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:08,900
That's alright.

866
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,740
Oh shit, wait!

867
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,260
Oh!

868
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,880
He's still figh- Oh wait, he's gonna fight with me?

869
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,500
Go back and right, I can handle this!

870
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,240
Boy!

871
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,480
Right!

872
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,220
I don't need your bull!

873
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,420
Go away- Oh wait, he's dead.

874
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,000
Okay, cool.

875
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,200
Really?

876
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:30,800
He's behind?

877
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,860
Oh yeah, he is.

878
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,280
Okay, that's fine.

879
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,560
Send in the wolves!

880
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,960
Send in the fucking wolves!

881
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,000
Oh, he's gone.

882
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,800
Oh, I can- I can, like, uh...

883
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,240
Oh, I can, like, do pushback!

884
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:46,900
I didn't know that.

885
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,660
Nice.

886
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,100
Okay.

887
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:52,880
Alright.

888
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,560
Now read.

889
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,520
Back to writing!

890
00:53:59,280 --> 00:53:59,760
Boy!

891
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,180
I didn't need your help!

892
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,320
Alright.

893
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,320
Right, boy, now write!

894
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,860
Write for me!

895
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,460
He's just writing one word.

896
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,020
I could've just done this myself.

897
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,600
Like, I didn't even have to know what the fuck I'm writing.

898
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,260
I could've- I could've just wrote this myself!

899
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:25,960
Alright, come on.

900
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:26,680
Get him out of here.

901
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,520
Oh!

902
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:28,820
Oh!

903
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,540
That's fucking right!

904
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,980
Just cause you're big doesn't mean you're strong!

905
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,680
Unless you're me.

906
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh no.

907
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,400
You touch me?

908
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,360
You dare to touch me?

909
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,700
How dare you!

910
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,040
No touchy!

911
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,260
That's fucking right!

912
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,480
You don't get to touch me!

913
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,760
Only I get to touch this beautiful body!

914
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,740
No touchy!

915
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:03,980
Oh shit!

916
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,300
Oh no!

917
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,100
Oh no!

918
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,380
Okay, write again!

919
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,640
Oh, we're not done yet, apparently!

920
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,480
We're not done yet!

921
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,540
Alright.

922
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,460
The only maiden that was allowed to touch this is dead.

923
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:27,060
So nobody else can touch this beautiful, sculpted body.

924
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,280
Sculpted by the hands of God.

925
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,380
So only I am worthy to touch myself.

926
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,700
Honestly, like, these guys are so weak, so- Oh.

927
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,780
Honestly, these guys are so- I still think they're really weak!

928
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,300
Doesn't matter!

929
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,750
Like, yeah, they're weak as hell.

930
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,570
Oh, alright, now we actually fight.

931
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,190
Now we fucking fight.

932
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:15,990
Where's the other guy?

933
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:17,610
Get over here.

934
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,570
Get over here!

935
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:20,590
Get over here!

936
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:24,810
Oh, you fucking touch this, you die!

937
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,230
You fucking die!

938
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,290
Alright- WHAT?!

939
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,570
They can just dodge that?!

940
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,370
That's it, I'm done.

941
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,650
I'm fucking done.

942
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:39,610
Okay.

943
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:41,170
I'll get this guy up.

944
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,450
Oh, this is a bit of a waste of a time, but that's okay!

945
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,790
It looked really cool, though!

946
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,690
It looked so cool, though, guys!

947
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:50,490
You don't understand!

948
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:53,950
It looked so fucking cool, though!

949
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,210
Where is she?

950
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:56,370
Where's the witch?

951
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,130
Oh no, this is- Oh my god, it's gonna break!

952
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,370
Please, is that the last one?

953
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:04,730
Oh no!

954
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:06,830
Okay, that has to be the last one!

955
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:07,450
Right!

956
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,150
Right, boy, right!

957
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,260
Okay, nice.

958
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,480
We're okay now.

959
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,440
We're almost there.

960
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:22,440
Pola!

961
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,260
He's literally writing one word!

962
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,980
I could've done this myself!

963
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,140
Oh shit!

964
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,340
Oh shit, oh no!

965
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,700
I didn't know.

966
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,840
Oh no!

967
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,560
Oh no!

968
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,060
Boy, please!

969
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,160
What do I do?

970
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:50,280
Jump, jump!

971
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,100
Alright, nice.

972
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,140
We made it.

973
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,480
We fucking made it.

974
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,020
I don't need no shield.

975
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,320
That is for- That's elf talk.

976
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,180
Shields are- This is curly cosmetic.

977
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:13,890
Shields are for elves and PUSSIES!

978
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,290
And I ain't no pussy!

979
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:16,930
True.

980
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:22,650
If you use a shield, you are not a real man.

981
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,250
You might as well cover up your nipples, too.

982
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,650
How dare you show your chest to me?

983
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,550
Wait, what?

984
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:36,610
Why didn't it let me kill him?

985
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,630
Alright, off I go.

986
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:42,530
He is not cool.

987
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,510
Alright, push boy!

988
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:48,670
PUSH!

989
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:53,010
I feel like he's not actually helping at all.

990
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,950
There's no way that boy can push up a fucking mountain.

991
00:58:56,930 --> 00:59:00,550
I feel like I'm just doing that to let him feel good about himself.

992
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,300
Do not be afraid!

993
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,700
He's like, I was never afraid in the first place, but now I will!

994
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,040
He's totally helping.

995
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,940
Bro, that was a sick shot.

996
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,280
6'3", 360 no scope.

997
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,620
Alright.

998
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,320
Nice, we did it.

999
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,510
We made it!

1000
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:47,810
Yay!

1001
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,050
That bird kinda cracked.

1002
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,950
The chisel tip!

1003
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:58,050
Give the man credit.

1004
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,510
He has a talent for destroying things.

1005
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:01,910
Remember that head.

1006
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:03,530
Never leaves my mind.

1007
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:07,310
Alright, we go...

1008
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:08,630
How do we get- oh, down?

1009
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,610
There's like something below me.

1010
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:13,290
How do I get down there?

1011
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,550
Wait, I wanna go down there.

1012
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,830
Ooh, I might need to go on a diet.

1013
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:21,170
Yeah.

1014
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:25,990
Woah.

1015
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:30,430
Woah, daddy has had too much carbs, boy!

1016
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,010
Wait, where's that coming from?

1017
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,210
Magni?

1018
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,570
Magni and Modi?

1019
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:48,390
Oh, there we go.

1020
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:49,370
Found it.

1021
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,670
This is more important, boy.

1022
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,270
It's called loot.

1023
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,610
Somebody died here and I must take their loot.

1024
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:01,630
Yeah.

1025
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,570
Alright, here we go.

1026
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:10,330
Up... and then...

1027
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,290
Oh, there it is.

1028
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:13,130
There's the ledge.

1029
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:17,310
Uh... oh.

1030
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,270
Hey, guys!

1031
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:24,250
I don't trust these guys.

1032
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,410
I don't trust the dead bodies at all.

1033
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,990
I feel like there always could be something.

1034
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,210
Alright, up I go.

1035
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:36,330
Up!

1036
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:40,430
Oh!

1037
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,990
It was those guys!

1038
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:45,990
Oh, there's sons of Thor?

1039
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:48,810
What?

1040
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,010
Wait, but...

1041
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,550
How the fuck do I get to the other side?

1042
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:00,750
What?

1043
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:02,450
Oh, there.

1044
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,550
Okay, it wouldn't let me jump for some reason.

1045
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,150
That's so weird.

1046
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:10,900
Jump!

1047
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,060
That's right, boy.

1048
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,000
Do it again!

1049
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,940
Make daddy proud!

1050
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,500
Do that jump again, boy!

1051
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,820
That's right, get- Oh, okay.

1052
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,080
Oh, you want to do the jump?

1053
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,220
I'm gonna leave you then.

1054
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:23,980
Come on!

1055
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,340
Do that jump!

1056
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,300
Come on!

1057
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,900
Oh, you don't want to do the jump now?

1058
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,640
Oh my god, I'm so proud of you, boy.

1059
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,680
Now jump again!

1060
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,040
Stretch those legs!

1061
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,920
There we go.

1062
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:36,880
I'm so proud of him.

1063
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,080
He did it.

1064
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,820
He's getting those fucking legs working.

1065
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:47,700
Okay.

1066
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,900
Door open.

1067
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:50,480
Oh!

1068
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,480
Seems like a nice place.

1069
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,200
Okay.

1070
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,060
Shoot?

1071
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,820
Oh, am I gonna fight that?

1072
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,800
I'm a little worried.

1073
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,340
I'm a little worried.

1074
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,640
Oh, okay.

1075
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,360
No, I'm not.

1076
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,240
Wait, what?

1077
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,600
What's gonna happen now?

1078
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:27,840
Oh!

1079
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,660
Okay, let's go!

1080
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:33,980
Oh, shit!

1081
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:34,800
What?

1082
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,180
What do you think I was- Oh!

1083
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,940
I wonder what's gonna happen if I do that!

1084
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,240
Guys, I don't know!

1085
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:56,740
Guys, I don't know what- It's like, you're like, I wonder what will happen if I do that.

1086
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,480
I wonder.

1087
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:06,320
Oh, there's no way something would actually happen, right?

1088
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,760
There's no way.

1089
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,540
How was I supposed to know?

1090
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,760
How was I supposed to know, guys?

1091
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,100
I was- I didn't know!

1092
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:24,900
Oh, no.

1093
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:25,960
Oh, no.

1094
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,440
Oh, no!

1095
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:28,680
Oh, wait.

1096
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,320
Maybe my boy can just do it.

1097
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,200
Just kill him.

1098
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,220
I feel like- Oh, shit!

1099
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:35,860
You know what?

1100
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,840
I don't even have to kill him.

1101
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,980
Legitimately, I can- Yeah, my boy can just kill him.

1102
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:41,900
He can just solo him.

1103
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,660
There you are.

1104
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,180
That's fucking right!

1105
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,960
Get down!

1106
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,760
Nice.

1107
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:56,240
Yeah!

1108
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,400
Oh, what's that?

1109
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:03,040
Something's- That tramples the enemy?

1110
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,080
Oh.

1111
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,640
It stuns.

1112
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,740
Oh, but the damage is not that good.

1113
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,960
I like the- Oh, no.

1114
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,620
I like the wolf more.

1115
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,400
I don't need- I feel like- Yeah, I'm gonna keep the wolf.

1116
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,020
I like the wolf.

1117
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,140
Nice.

1118
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:29,700
I don't know why I- I don't know why I thought- I'd be like, there's no way he's gonna come out.

1119
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,540
Come out of that.

1120
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:31,960
No.

1121
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,280
There's no way.

1122
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,080
What's over on this side, then?

1123
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,000
Is it also people?

1124
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,080
Oh, it was people.

1125
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,340
Wait, so I made it harder for myself.

1126
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,560
Accidentally.

1127
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,240
You know what?

1128
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,500
I don't even need to fight.

1129
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,600
I'm just distraction.

1130
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:55,220
Go, boy!

1131
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,200
Show me what you got, boy!

1132
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,180
Woah!

1133
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,040
Show me what you got!

1134
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:00,980
Oh, fuck!

1135
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:01,940
Okay, sorry.

1136
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,860
Come on, do your thing, boy!

1137
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,880
He's almost dead!

1138
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,500
Woah!

1139
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:09,680
Woah!

1140
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,220
Okay, how does that hit?

1141
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,100
Okay, that's- that's- oh shit.

1142
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,880
Oh shit, I became a- oh no, that's not what I wanted.

1143
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,060
No, boy!

1144
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,380
No, boy!

1145
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:20,340
You ruined it!

1146
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,880
You ruined the run, boy!

1147
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,120
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

1148
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,040
You ruined the run!

1149
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,980
I can't believe you made me use that shield!

1150
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,200
Oh man!

1151
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,680
I gotta go to the gym after this.

1152
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,860
Now dad's angry and he must go to the gym and drink his protein powder.

1153
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,160
I gotta increase the testosterone now.

1154
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,200
Alright, nice.

1155
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,160
Got XP.

1156
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,980
I got this.

1157
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:08,220
Nice.

1158
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,080
Alright, uh...

1159
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,720
Get swole for the boys.

1160
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:16,700
Oh.

1161
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,520
Oh, what the fuck?

1162
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,720
I didn't- I didn't even do anything!

1163
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:21,800
Okay.

1164
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,860
I actually- Okay, do I have enough for him?

1165
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:29,660
You know what?

1166
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,740
Fuck it, let me- Let me just- Wait, no.

1167
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,200
Let me just swing my axe around.

1168
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,580
Oh shit!

1169
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,280
Oh no.

1170
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,560
Oh no.

1171
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:42,640
Come on.

1172
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:43,440
Oh!

1173
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,280
No, I can do it again!

1174
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,680
And I can do it again!

1175
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,140
Oh shit!

1176
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,220
Wait, he has fire claws?!

1177
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:54,640
Wait, that's illegal!

1178
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,000
Okay.

1179
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:58,220
I'm gonna swing.

1180
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,470
And then...

1181
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:02,280
And then I'm gonna- What?!

1182
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,420
Oh my god!

1183
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,820
It just went down!

1184
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,460
He has rabies!

1185
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,760
Jesus Christ.

1186
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,300
Guys, you didn't see me use the shield.

1187
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,600
I would never do that.

1188
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,700
I'm not a fucking elf.

1189
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:20,360
What do you mean you're not ready?

1190
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,560
What the fuck do you mean you're not ready?

1191
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,820
What do you mean?

1192
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,260
Oh nice, I got it.

1193
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,080
Nice.

1194
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:32,820
Down.

1195
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,220
Down.

1196
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,560
Oh, that was rough.

1197
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,860
That was pretty rough, guys.

1198
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,720
Not gonna lie.

1199
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,780
But I'm okay now.

1200
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,900
Kratos does not give a fuck about rabies.

1201
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:53,260
Alright guys.

1202
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:56,640
If I start being afraid of water, we know what happened.

1203
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,520
Alright.

1204
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:03,080
Let's go up here.

1205
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,700
And then let's grab this guy's treasure.

1206
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,560
And I guess we go this way.

1207
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,160
What?

1208
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:15,940
What's ahead?

1209
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,320
Wait, how did he get here?

1210
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,700
A whetstone?

1211
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,260
Whetstone?

1212
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,520
What do you mean a whetstone?

1213
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:36,520
Okay.

1214
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,300
Can I upgrade my... no, not yet.

1215
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:43,660
I don't know.

1216
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,400
I don't wanna buy...

1217
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,360
I don't wanna buy like...

1218
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,120
I don't wanna buy any armor.

1219
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,820
Cause I feel like I'm just gonna find better armor later.

1220
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:54,560
You know?

1221
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,260
So I don't really wanna buy any.

1222
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,860
Get the revive stone?

1223
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,940
Where's the revive stone?

1224
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,580
Oh, there he is.

1225
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,620
I don't need no revive stone.

1226
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,620
What do you think I am?

1227
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,180
An elf?

1228
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,520
You think I'm a fucking elf, chat?

1229
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,100
I don't need no revives.

1230
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,260
A man gets it done once and that's all he needs.

1231
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,580
Wait, why is this locked?

1232
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,300
Do I need to like grab this?

1233
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,740
And throw it out here?

1234
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,300
And shoot it?

1235
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,860
Oh, there it is.

1236
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:47,980
God, I'm so smart.

1237
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,760
Famous last words.

1238
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,340
I just need one last word.

1239
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:57,880
And try.

1240
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,760
Alright, and then...

1241
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,200
I can lock this now.

1242
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,880
No magic can stop me.

1243
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:14,760
I'll steal your... I'll steal your grave no matter what.

1244
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,140
Alright, this way.

1245
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,400
And then...

1246
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,040
This way.

1247
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,440
And then this way.

1248
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,580
Oh, why is there lava there?

1249
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,980
Oh shit.

1250
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,280
You think they noticed?

1251
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,780
That's mean.

1252
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:47,680
Oh shit!

1253
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:50,230
Um...

1254
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,020
Hey there.

1255
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,200
I see you freed your nipple too.

1256
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,220
Wait, wait a minute.

1257
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:05,560
Wait.

1258
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:06,680
No, wait.

1259
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,340
Wait a minute.

1260
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:08,640
Wait.

1261
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,660
I invested in the boy.

1262
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,080
Wait.

1263
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,480
I was gonna be like, there's no way.

1264
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,820
There's no way you're gonna take the boy away.

1265
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,360
I refuse to let you take the boy away from me.

1266
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,380
I spent way too much money for this.

1267
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,800
You will not take him away.

1268
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:37,740
Oh guys, guys.

1269
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,840
Sometimes you have to use...

1270
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,180
Sometimes...

1271
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:41,660
Thanks boy.

1272
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,020
Oh shit.

1273
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,640
Sometimes you have to use it.

1274
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,160
Okay, it's...

1275
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,360
This is...

1276
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,280
Oh shit!

1277
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,780
Hey guys.

1278
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:56,300
Guys.

1279
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:00,580
Guys, why are they so strong?

1280
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,780
Wait a minute.

1281
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,900
Wait a minute.

1282
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,540
Why are they really, really strong?

1283
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,160
Oh no.

1284
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:20,680
Oh no.

1285
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,940
Oh no.

1286
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:28,420
What?

1287
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:29,860
What?

1288
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,600
What's going on?

1289
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,280
Doing what?

1290
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,940
Oh.

1291
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,540
Oh god.

1292
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,240
I'm scared.

1293
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,920
I'm so scared.

1294
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,040
Oh.

1295
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,220
Oh!

1296
01:13:59,120 --> 01:13:59,580
Okay.

1297
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,340
Okay.

1298
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:02,100
Okay.

1299
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:04,620
Oh!

1300
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,880
It's coming so slowly towards me.

1301
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,480
Oh my god.

1302
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,960
Oh no!

1303
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:17,700
No!

1304
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:21,500
Oh shit!

1305
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,600
Oh fuck!

1306
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:23,860
Okay.

1307
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,960
Keep using your bow boy!

1308
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,140
Oh god.

1309
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:36,650
Okay.

1310
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:37,410
Oh shit!

1311
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,850
That's fine.

1312
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:38,290
That's fine.

1313
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,690
Oh I have to...

1314
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:40,970
No!

1315
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:41,470
No!

1316
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:42,550
Break it!

1317
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:42,930
Break it!

1318
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:43,310

01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:44,410
Break it!

1322
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:49,610
Oh shit.

1323
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:50,450
I did not mean...

1324
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:51,770
I did not mean to do that!

1325
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:54,590
That's fine.

1326
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:57,650
Just keep using your bow boy!

1327
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:01,450
Okay.

1328
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:03,930
Oh shit!

1329
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,150
Okay.

1332
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:05,370
It's fine!

1333
01:15:05,390 --> 01:15:05,770
It's fine!

1334
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:06,530
We're so healthy!

1335
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:07,250
We're so healthy!

1336
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:08,590
We're so healthy!

1337
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:10,270
Oh we're so healthy!

1338
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:13,090
Oh fuck!

1339
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:13,910
Where is that going?

1340
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:14,710
I don't know!

1341
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:18,390
Oh fuck!

1342
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:23,470
Okay.

01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:24,830
Okay it's fine.

01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:26,530
It's fine!

1345
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,010
I can't see!

1346
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,570
Wait what?

1347
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:38,390
Okay come on!

1348
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:39,170
Come on!

01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:43,950
Oh no!

1352
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:53,810
Woo!

01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:55,330
Woo!

1354
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:58,110
They baited me!

1355
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:00,470
Oh.

1356
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:02,050
Wow!

1357
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,070
Wow!

1358
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,910
Oh my god!

1359
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,470
I'm so scared!

1360
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:11,030
That's fine!

1361
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:12,970
We got him!

1362
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:14,310
Boy!

1363
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,090
Be careful boy!

1364
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:18,130
They're Norse!

1365
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:21,510
No!

1366
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,110
Be careful!

1367
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:29,070
What?

1368
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:29,330

1369
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:32,950
Okay nice!

1375
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:35,310
Nice!

1376
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,750
Oh my god!

1377
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:40,110
Are you fucking serious?

1378
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:43,730
Oh my god!

1379
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:46,170
Come on!

1380
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:46,450

1381
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:46,750
Please!

1382
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,050
Please!

1383
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:47,310
Please!

1384
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:47,610
Please!

1385
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:52,970
Wait he has?

1386
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,550
Oh shit he has!

1387
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:56,830
I was like what?

1388
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:58,530
Oh shit!

1389
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,610
We're not healthy anymore guys!

1390
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:04,990
We're not healthy anymore guys!

1391
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:07,010
I'm a little scared!

1392
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:10,990
Come on!

1393
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,230
Oh no!

1394
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:15,510
Oh no!

1395
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,120
No please!

1396
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,780
Oh shit!

1397
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:25,400
Come on!

1398
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,260
No I didn't break it!

1399
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:31,980
Oh my god!

1400
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,340
This is so scary!

1401
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,140
Oh fuck!

1402
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,040
There we go!

1403
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:45,200
This is it!

1404
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:45,540
This is it!

1405
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:45,880
This is it!

1406
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,540
Come on!

1407
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:49,960
He's so low!

1408
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:51,680
Come on!

1409
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:55,450
Oh no!

1410
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,730
No!

1411
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:56,270
No!

1412
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:56,550
No!

1413
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:56,690
No!

1414
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:56,830
No!

1415
01:17:56,890 --> 01:17:56,910
No!

1416
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,910
Come on!

1417
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:01,850
He's so low!

1418
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:06,670
Boy I'm very scared boy!

1419
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:09,690
Because I'm very, very low!

1420
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,810
And I really need you to do something!

1421
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:19,970
Come on!

1422
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:21,010
Please!

1423
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:22,330
Please!

1424
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,230
Oh no!

1425
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:32,950
Oh!

1426
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,120
Attack!

1427
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,740
Do it!

1428
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,400
That's right I'm gonna cut off your nipples!

1429
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,580
You don't deserve nipples!

1430
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,060
That's right I did it!

1431
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,340
He did not deserve to keep the nipples free!

1432
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:01,700
Huh?

1433
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:11,740
Oh!

1434
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,360
Oh!

1435
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,120
I almost restart!

1436
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,660
Oh my god I did it!

1437
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,620
Oh my god!

1438
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,240
I'm so scared!

1439
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,880
I thought I got the restart!

1440
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:32,160
Are you okay?

1441
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,580
What happened boy?

1442
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,740
Why is he sick?

1443
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,880
Wait do you have rabies?

1444
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:55,980
Did he bite you?

1445
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,100
Oh my god!

1446
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:07,880
That was...

1447
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,320
The older son of Thor, he had a huge sword and was really...

1448
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,720
And was really mean.

1449
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,260
Yeah he was.

1450
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,440
He was pretty mean alright.

1451
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:22,700
Alright nice.

1452
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,840
Yeah he was a fucking meanie.

1453
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,840
Alright, cool.

1454
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,280
This man does not deserve to free the nipple.

1455
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:36,860
He was weak!

1456
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,280
Only real man can free the nipple.

1457
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:44,260
He should have covered it up like the pussy he is.

1458
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,480
Wonder if I can go through here.

1459
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,200
He was so rude.

1460
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,360
He was a big meanie.

1461
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,760
What a meanie head.

1462
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:57,540
True.

1463
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:58,880
Oh!

1464
01:20:59,400 --> 01:20:59,980
Swing!

1465
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,160
Swing!

1466
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,380
Alright, I got it.

1467
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:15,920
Should do.

1468
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,300
Yippee!

1469
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,260
Okay, return to the boat.

1470
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:25,620
Oh!

1471
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,980
What a coincidence.

1472
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,880
Find the binding point and then...

1473
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:38,320
How do I know what the binding point is?

1474
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:41,360
Is it this?

1475
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:41,420
Then?

1476
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,040
Oh is it this?

1477
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:47,800
Right?

1478
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,420
That?

1479
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:53,260
Oh!

1480
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,060
Okay.

1481
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,140
I get it.

1482
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:58,780
Yeah!

1483
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,500
We killed so many things, boy.

1484
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,260
Oh, they'll just make more babies.

1485
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:33,330
Boy, it's okay.

1486
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:35,850
All gods love to do is fuck.

1487
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:37,230
They'll just make new children.

1488
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:38,690
You think he really cares?

1489
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,550
That's all they do, boy.

1490
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:43,150
New lesson for you.

1491
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:47,010
How do I ticket this?

1492
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:49,830
It's like...

1493
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:50,250
It's over there.

1494
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:53,850
Oh, okay.

1495
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:54,990
I just throw my...

1496
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:55,650
I just throw it.

1497
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,830
Where's the other one, though?

1498
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,430
There's one here.

1499
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:04,870
But where's the two and three?

1500
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,260
Just another Tuesday for the gods.

1501
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,640
Sometimes they don't even fuck each other.

1502
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,740
Sometimes they wanna bang an animal.

1503
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,860
And apparently, that is morally okay for them.

1504
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,280
I'm looking at you, Loki!

1505
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,640
You're really, really lucky.

1506
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:24,680
You like the...

1507
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,880
You really, really like the animals.

1508
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:35,590
Didn't like...

1509
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:37,230
Didn't like Zeus...

1510
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:40,730
Like...

1511
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:42,190
Didn't he turn into a goose?

1512
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:43,770
At one point?

1513
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:46,810
Oh, he was a freak freak.

1514
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,220
Where the fuck are the other seals?

1515
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:57,060
Oh, there it is.

1516
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:57,540
There's one.

1517
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:05,190
He turned into a lot of things.

1518
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:06,310
Oh, hey there.

1519
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:07,870
Hey there, boy.

1520
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:11,050
No, they all...

1521
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:13,450
They all really, really like to turn into animals.

1522
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:16,030
Specifically, animals.

1523
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,600
I'm missing one more.

1524
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,860
Don't the original furry.

1525
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,500
Honestly?

1526
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:32,460
No.

1527
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:33,140
No, you're right.

1528
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,300
No, I won't argue against that.

1529
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,280
It was the...

1530
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,700
The birth father of a furry.

1531
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:47,280
I'm like, missing one more seal and it has to be here.

1532
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,600
Oh, I hate seal searching.

1533
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,140
I hate it so much.

1534
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,680
Oh, he is the fur father.

1535
01:24:59,020 --> 01:24:59,820
You are correct.

1536
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:03,220
He truly was one of the greats.

1537
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,560
You saw it?

1538
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:06,740
Which way?

1539
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:08,740
I didn't see it.

1540
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:18,050
I feel like you're lying to me.

1541
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:23,960
Boy, please.

1542
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,760
I'm trying to find the stupid seal.

1543
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:29,780
Where could it be?

1544
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:34,790
Oh, there it is.

1545
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:35,630
Oh my god.

1546
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:37,590
Is this like playing like...

1547
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:39,150
Like those picture...

1548
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:40,790
The find the picture book stuff?

1549
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:42,430
Oh, yeah.

1550
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:43,310
That should open it.

1551
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:46,850
Uh...

1552
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,170
I started from one of those...

1553
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:48,750
Like those...

1554
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:50,050
Like...

1555
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:50,930
The hidden pictures.

1556
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:52,190
They're not...

1557
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,350
I mean, it's sort of like Where's Waldo?

1558
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:54,270
But the other one.

1559
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:55,950
The other picture book.

1560
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:57,290
The one where like...

1561
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:57,710
Uh...

1562
01:25:57,710 --> 01:25:58,130
I Spy!

1563
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1564
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,330
I felt like I was playing I Spy there.

1565
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:03,970
But not the fun way.

1566
01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:10,110
Okay, up I go.

1567
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:11,610
Up.

1568
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:12,990
Up.

1569
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:14,150
Down.

1570
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:18,870
Okay, and then...

1571
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:19,470
Oh, wait.

1572
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:20,450
Before I climb up.

1573
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:26,470
I wanna get this out first.

1574
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:28,870
Oh, I backtracked.

1575
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:36,250
Oh my god.

1576
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,330
Green is not a creative color.

1577
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:39,930
Okay, nice.

1578
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:41,430
I can finally upgrade my axe.

1579
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:44,830
Yay!

1580
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:47,050
Can I upgrade anything else?

1581
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:49,930
I don't wanna upgrade any...

1582
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:50,890
I don't wanna upgrade all of these.

1583
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:55,190
Uh...

1584
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:56,330
Do I have anything for you?

1585
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:57,330
I don't, right?

1586
01:26:58,330 --> 01:26:59,170
Wasn't there another door?

1587
01:26:59,190 --> 01:26:59,970
Oh, there's the other door.

1588
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:02,790
No!

1589
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:05,150
I will find better armor.

1590
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:10,210
I don't need to waste my money on fucking armor.

1591
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,550
I will find better armor.

1592
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:18,560
There you go.

1593
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:21,140
He said he's fine, guys.

1594
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:25,280
Guys, I know how to raise my son!

1595
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,240
There you go.

1596
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:36,640
What do you realize, boy?

1597
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:38,740
Oh yeah, he did.

1598
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:39,760
Interesting.

1599
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:43,960
Okay,

1600
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,070
I'm gonna find...

1601
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:53,860
Oh!

1602
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,280
Wait, can I bring it over?

1603
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,940
I wonder if I can bring it over.

1604
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,500
Boy.

1605
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,420
Do not worry.

1606
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,960
You are a man.

1607
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:13,160
You shall toughen up and beat the virus up with your fucking fists.

1608
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:14,580
Oh, I can't.

1609
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,180
I can't pick that up.

1610
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:26,760
You'll beat up the virus with your fists if you have to.

1611
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,360
Wait, how do I...

1612
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:28,940
Okay, there you go.

1613
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,900
Oh, I need to get the crystal first.

1614
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:37,040
There you go.

1615
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,980
Wait, this is not...

1616
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,540
Do I need to...

1617
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:42,420
What?

1618
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,040
Where's the red?

1619
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,360
Oh, there it is.

1620
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:55,150
Alright, and then we chuck it up here.

1621
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,340
And then you explode it.

1622
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,500
And then we grab the crystal.

1623
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,700
Loli, thank you for the super chat.

1624
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:06,560
Thank you, thank you.

1625
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,580
Poseidon made the queen of Crete have the hots for a bowl, making the minotaur.

1626
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:12,140
Also, what about Egypt?

1627
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,060
Almohad god millennia.

1628
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,560
Before the Greeks.

1629
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,280
People were just fucking freaky.

1630
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:21,540
Oh.

1631
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,680
And then...

1632
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,780
I wonder who was the first furry.

1633
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:34,430
Oh, what did I get?

1634
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:39,430
Me.

1635
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:43,510
It was me.

1636
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:48,160
What was the...

1637
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:54,140
What was the first civilization that was like, man, that's pretty hot.

1638
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,540
Alright, and then...

1639
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:02,420
Get over here, boy.

1640
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,620
Boy, I need you over here to open my chest, boy.

1641
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,960
Oh my god, I have to like...

1642
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,120
I have to like...

1643
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:12,900
Go here.

1644
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,580
So he'll follow me.

1645
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,540
And then go over here.

1646
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,120
So he'll shoot this.

1647
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,180
Boy, please.

1648
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,360
Okay.

1649
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:23,960
Now shoot it.

1650
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,920
Oh my god, boy, please.

1651
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,020
Boy, oh my god, boy.

1652
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,020
I can't.

1653
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,080
I can't with you.

1654
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:35,840
You gotta beat up that virus faster.

1655
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:37,680
You gotta...

1656
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,160
You gotta fix you faster, boy.

1657
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:44,860
His tuberculosis is actually affecting him.

1658
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:50,640
Oh, hey, it is.

1659
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:06,680
Oh, I do this.

1660
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:07,380
Oh.

1661
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:10,220
Swing.

1662
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:11,260
Okay.

1663
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,140
Sorry.

1664
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:13,140
Swing.

1665
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,620
What do I do here?

1666
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,060
Oh, okay.

1667
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:22,860
We climb up.

1668
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,580
Go get it, boy.

1669
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,000
Make daddy proud.

1670
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:38,660
What is he gonna do?

1671
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,100
What is he doing?

1672
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:42,900
Oh!

1673
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,660
Is he on it?

1674
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,460
I can't tell.

1675
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,120
Oh, he is.

1676
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:49,980
He's just so small.

1677
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,280
Alright, there we go.

1678
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,820
And you know what to do, right?

1679
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,080
Come on!

1680
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:03,540
Come on!

1681
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,480
Oh, you want me to tell you to drop the rope?

1682
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,760
Oh, thanks for telling me there's a rope and not dropping it, my son.

1683
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:11,520
I love you.

1684
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,220
I love you so much.

1685
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,020
Huh?

1686
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,040
Okay, this way.

1687
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:22,840
Wait, what?

1688
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,980
Do I have to jam it?

1689
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:29,660
Huh?

1690
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,240
I jam this?

1691
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:33,760
No.

1692
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,160
Wait, I can?

1693
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:44,380
I'm thinking.

1694
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:55,380
Oh!

1695
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,060
Okay.

1696
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,380
Now that he's on the other side.

1697
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,380
Wait, there is one?

1698
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:08,620
Where is it?

1699
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:14,250
Did I like look at it and didn't care?

1700
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,720
Oh, I did.

1701
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,900
I did.

1702
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,360
I did.

1703
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,440
I looked at it and didn't care.

1704
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:38,120
I did it, guys.

1705
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:43,220
Oh, sorry.

1706
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,760
I did not mean it.

1707
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,180
I did not mean it.

1708
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:48,420
Sorry, I missed input, guys.

1709
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:51,580
I do not beat up children.

1710
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:55,940
I swear to God, it was a mis-input.

1711
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:56,920
I did not...

1712
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:59,200
I do not beat up children.

1713
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:08,130
Okay, now that we got that out of the way, we can do this.

1714
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:12,990
Oh, what?

1715
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:14,190
What's glowing?

1716
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,890
Oh, it's here.

1717
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:17,690
Okay, and then...

1718
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:18,670
Right here.

1719
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:22,690
Hey!

1720
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:24,610
Door open!

1721
01:34:29,490 --> 01:34:30,150
Huh?

1722
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:33,830
Are we?

1723
01:34:34,490 --> 01:34:35,710
I'm a little lost.

1724
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:36,810
Not gonna lie.

1725
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:42,790
Okay, grab that.

1726
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:45,590
I came from here.

1727
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,670
So, it should be up here.

1728
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,650
But there's something up here, though.

1729
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:52,910
There's a yellow here.

1730
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,550
Is there anything here?

1731
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,230
Have I been here before?

1732
01:34:59,470 --> 01:34:59,570
Oh, no.

1733
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:00,310
Oh, wait!

1734
01:35:00,410 --> 01:35:01,590
I have been here!

1735
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:02,910
Whoa!

1736
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:05,250
Whoops.

1737
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:06,150
My bad.

1738
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:07,710
Got you.

1739
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:09,370
I didn't realize we're backtracking.

1740
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:12,190
Even though the entire thing was that we're backtracking.

1741
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:19,550
I know he told us we're going back, but then I also did not realize we were going back.

1742
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:25,350
Oh, we're back here!

1743
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:34,400
But what is it?

1744
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:34,820
Okay.

1745
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,740
I played these games before!

1746
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:45,340
I feel better now.

1747
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,300
I told you!

1748
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,880
My boy's not a pussy!

1749
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,220
He beat up the virus with his own fist!

1750
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,480
We don't need...

1751
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:56,900
Wait, there's a door?

1752
01:35:58,740 --> 01:35:59,840
Wait, where's the door?

1753
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:04,900
He walked it off.

1754
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:06,800
That's my boy!

1755
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,920
He strangled the virus!

1756
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:19,320
Oh, can't use the door right now?

1757
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:19,640
Okay.

1758
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:20,420
We'll go back.

1759
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:27,560
Alright,

1760
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,460
let's row our boat back.

1761
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:35,500
Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream.

1762
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:37,700
Merrily, merrily, merrily...

1763
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,040
Okay, I didn't blow my nose.

1764
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,160
Go tell your stories.

1765
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:03,820
Oh!

1766
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:07,980
Oh!

1767
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:11,340
It's the witch!

1768
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,280
It's the witch!

1769
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:26,660
Alright, we'll go this way.

1770
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:30,260
And then...

1771
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:31,760
Well...

1772
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:32,860
That's the way to go.

1773
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:38,160
Okay, thank God we have the hand to guide us.

1774
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,040
Should be this way, right?

1775
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:43,680
Wait, wasn't there a door right here?

1776
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:46,520
I don't remember.

1777
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,280
I remember there was a dead guy here.

1778
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:52,400
Did I find her bones yet?

1779
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:56,500
No, there wasn't.

1780
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:56,940
Alright.

1781
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,540
I go now.

1782
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:00,460
Goodbye.

1783
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:09,120
Well, I know when I don't need to do that.

1784
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,120
Goodbye now.

1785
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:18,100
Alright, I guess he'll never be reunited with his love.

1786
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,380
Good fucking riddance.

1787
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:20,760
He needs to learn.

1788
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,360
There's no such thing as love.

1789
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:23,700
Oh!

1790
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,540
It's all fake.

1791
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:32,460
Wait, what?

1792
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:33,800
Wait, I saw something.

1793
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:34,440
It was invisible.

1794
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,100
I saw it.

1795
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,300
But it was invisible.

1796
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:44,590
What?

1797
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:45,910
Is it here?

1798
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,970
Do I dock it here?

1799
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,010
Oh, I do.

1800
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:49,510
Oh, there's a mystery door!

1801
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:55,490
Mystery door.

1802
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:59,010
I like how the head has it's own little seat too.

1803
01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:05,810
Right here.

1804
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,130
Here's one of them.

1805
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:10,810
And then here's the second.

1806
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:13,490
Oh, there's a third?!

1807
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:21,010
Is there treasure?

1808
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:23,290
What's in here?

1809
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:30,710
Another one of these.

1810
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,770
Oh, Reed, boy.

1811
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:36,430
The middle panel is missing.

1812
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:37,010
Oh.

1813
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:39,610
I thought Tyr was a rock, not a giant.

1814
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:43,150
Ah, but he was loved by everyone, including the Giants.

1815
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:47,370
Other than me, he was the only one they gifted with their special sight.

1816
01:39:48,050 --> 01:39:51,330
Hey, I wonder if the Giants left a triptych about me somewhere too.

1817
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:54,450
Oh.

1818
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:57,090
Sorry, I just need to adjust the volume.

1819
01:39:57,570 --> 01:40:00,970
Cause every time I mute, the volume goes down!

1820
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:02,610
Alright.

1821
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:04,390
Oh, he can't finish reading.

1822
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,950
What do I do?

1823
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:11,010
But where?

1824
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:20,950
Boy, if I haven't learned how to read by now...

1825
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:24,290
I'm not here to learn to read now.

1826
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:28,690
Boy.

1827
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:30,550
Boy, I...

1828
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,490
Boy.

1829
01:40:32,850 --> 01:40:33,850
I am...

1830
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:36,190
I have to be really, really old right now, boy.

1831
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:37,890
And I'm not here to...

1832
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:40,710
I am not here to actually learn.

1833
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:42,750
It is a choice, boy.

1834
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,370
It was not...

1835
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:45,550
It was a choice.

1836
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:51,850
Ha ha!

1837
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:57,970
Boy, I am not stupid.

1838
01:40:58,110 --> 01:40:59,370
I know how to read.

1839
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:06,370
What?

1840
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:12,070
What do I smell?

1841
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,110
What is that?

1842
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:19,610
What?

1843
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:20,410
Whoa!

1844
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:25,210
Oh shit!

1845
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:47,390
Oh shit!

1846
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:53,290
Ha ha ha!

1847
01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:55,610
Let me touch the electricity!

1848
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:57,870
Ha ha ha!

1849
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:01,790
Oh my god!

1850
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:03,610
Boy, I am...

1851
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:06,490
Yeah, he definitely got that from me.

1852
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:10,110
We gotta kill him before he resists!

1853
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:11,210
Ha ha ha!

1854
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:13,130
What?

1855
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:18,070
What?

1856
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:22,790
Oh shit!

1857
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:24,910
Oh, okay.

1858
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:28,930
Okay.

1859
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:30,330
Ha ha ha!

1860
01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:33,590
Alright, boy.

1861
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:35,470
You did your best, boy!

1862
01:42:36,090 --> 01:42:36,530
You...

1863
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:37,690
You did your best.

1864
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:38,130
I...

1865
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:39,030
It's the effort.

1866
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:42,250
He died.

1867
01:42:42,710 --> 01:42:43,190
He...

1868
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:45,070
He Spartan Rage failed.

1869
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:47,510
He failed the quick time event, guys.

1870
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,500
This isn't over!

1871
01:43:05,740 --> 01:43:08,720
You see how he covered up his nipples now?

1872
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,560
Cause you know he doesn't deserve it.

1873
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,880
You have to get him to Freya quickly.

1874
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,000
There's no other way.

1875
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:18,360
No.

1876
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,320
He was supposed to beat up the virus.

1877
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:22,400
No!

1878
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:27,080
You were supposed to be strong, not overload!

1879
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:29,380
Like, what the fuck, boy?

1880
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:30,300
What?

1881
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:31,340
This way?

1882
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,900
Boy, that was so sad.

1883
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:36,940
That he didn't walk it off.

1884
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:38,400
That was so...

1885
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,180
That was pretty funny.

1886
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,580
It felt like he was like...

1887
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,620
You know when you had to...

1888
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:43,320
You put too many, um...

1889
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,200
Chargers on the outlet?

1890
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:46,400
You know that?

1891
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:47,960
And then it just...

1892
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:48,840
He just blew up?

1893
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,160
That's what it felt like.

1894
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,380
It felt like he put...

1895
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:57,260
It felt like he actually overloaded the circuits.

1896
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:04,980
Boy, you were supposed to walk it off.

1897
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:11,400
You were supposed to beat up the virus with your hands.

1898
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,500
Okay, it is here.

1899
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,280
Yeah, he tripped the circuit breaker.

1900
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,180
Is it this way?

1901
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,260
It has to be this way.

1902
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:30,380
He'll be okay, guys.

1903
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:33,260
Guys, he might be very white right now.

1904
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:35,300
And he might not be breathing.

1905
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,140
But he'll be okay, guys.

1906
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:38,920
He'll be so healthy.

1907
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,540
He's so fucking healthy.

1908
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,040
I swear he's breathing.

1909
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,840
Wait, is he a god?

1910
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,840
I mean, Freya's a god, so like...

1911
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,840
So I guess like...

1912
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:15,000
So he's like tapping into his like...

1913
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:16,120
Potential.

1914
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19,560
Wait, what the fuck?

1915
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:20,480
It didn't let me dock.

1916
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,960
Yeah, he is my son.

1917
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:24,900
I don't know!

1918
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,800
It's like how like, you know when people say like...

1919
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,340
They can be born non-magical.

1920
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:32,200
I just thought he was born not a god.

1921
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,760
Like the 0.1%.

1922
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:38,000
Yeah, but like, you know how there's like a 0.1% that he becomes a failure?

1923
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:38,900
Where he...

1924
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,340
I'm sorry, I mean...

1925
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:48,700
You know, when he's born with nothing.

1926
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:55,240
So I just thought that he was born without...

1927
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,520
Well, we hit the...

1928
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:59,080
We hit the lottery, but like the bad lottery.

1929
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:04,770
Poor boy.

1930
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:12,990
Yeah, you know like, it skipped a generation, you know?

1931
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:14,770
I was like...

1932
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:17,110
We hit the lottery, but like...

1933
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:18,590
The bad kind of lottery.

1934
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:27,720
Oh my god, I knew you had some god in you.

1935
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,120
I knew it.

1936
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:34,850
Don't worry, boy.

1937
01:46:35,070 --> 01:46:37,610
Now that I know you're an actual god...

1938
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:40,510
Now I love you.

1939
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:46,610
Now I will finally acknowledge you, boy.

1940
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:50,570
Alright, here we go.

1941
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:53,290
Freya!

1942
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:55,690
We need your help!

1943
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:58,830
Woman, do you hear me?!

1944
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:00,250
It is urgent!

1945
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:02,230
I'm still a god!

1946
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:02,950
Go away!

1947
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:05,250
What the fuck?!

1948
01:47:08,950 --> 01:47:10,130
Go away!

1949
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:13,970
Inside.

1950
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,950
This is no ordinary illness.

1951
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:22,030
The boy's true nature, your true nature, fights within him.

1952
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:25,730
I

1953
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:32,280
did this to him.

1954
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:35,620
Will you help me?

1955
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:38,820
Oh, you look so sad.

1956
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,240
Of course.

1957
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:43,840
There is a rare ingredient found only in Helheim.

1958
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:46,240
The keeper that protects the Bridge of the Damned.

1959
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,340
I need its heart.

1960
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:49,860
Hell?

1961
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:50,900
The Realm of the Dead.

1962
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:51,620
Do you know it?

1963
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:52,980
Not this one.

1964
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:56,200
It is a land of unyielding gold.

1965
01:47:56,900 --> 01:48:01,780
Fires cannot burn there and no magic in all the Nine Realms can create a blaze.

1966
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:05,320
As for the dead, your Frost Axe will be useless.

1967
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,220
You'll need to find something else.

1968
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:09,860
I need the Fire Axe.

1969
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:14,000
Oh my god, I gotta kill Hela before she revives the son.

1970
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:18,430
Dig up her past, I swore.

1971
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:19,770
It would stay buried.

1972
01:48:20,990 --> 01:48:22,630
Who you were before doesn't matter.

1973
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:26,370
This boy is not your past, he is your son.

1974
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:28,530
And he needs his father.

1975
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:30,530
Hela needs...

1976
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:43,850
Oh?

1977
01:48:58,530 --> 01:48:59,690
Wait, isn't there one bridge?

1978
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:02,930
Who's gonna take care of the bridge after he's dead?

1979
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:07,470
Would that mean like the undead can go in and out whenever they want now?

1980
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:17,530
Not his problem.

1981
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:23,570
It's not our problem.

1982
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:24,830
I will keep him safe.

1983
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:27,730
That's a mother's promise.

1984
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:40,060
Alright.

1985
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:41,280
Oh no.

1986
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,280
Wait.

1987
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:45,200
I invested so much money into him.

1988
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,660
Wait a minute.

1989
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:48,900
I have to do my own work?

1990
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:49,700
Oh no.

1991
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:53,080
Now I actually have to do my own work.

1992
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:54,400
Oh no.

1993
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:59,260
Now I have to kill people myself?

1994
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:01,440
My boat is down the path.

1995
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:01,700
Go.

1996
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:05,640
Helheim of all places.

1997
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:07,760
Oh my god.

1998
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:08,260
There it is.

1999
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,560
I will do what I must.

2000
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,560
I wasted so much money on this boy.

2001
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:15,260
No!

2002
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:20,810
Oh shoot.

2003
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:21,790
Now what?

2004
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:28,810
This boat...

2005
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:31,690
This boat is not... not it for him.

2006
01:50:41,090 --> 01:50:41,710
Spooky.

2007
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:47,090
This boat is not manly.

2008
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:53,540
Oh.

2009
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:11,690
Maybe Thor found out his son is dead.

2010
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:20,480
Hello?

2011
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,180
What the fuck?

2012
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,480
Who are you?

2013
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,740
She's creepy.

2014
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:34,780
Athena?

2015
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:34,940
Athena?

2016
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:41,900
Oh my god.

2017
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:42,260
Woman.

2018
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:45,040
I don't like that.

2019
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,160
What?

2020
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:01,250
Oh.

2021
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:01,750
Okay.

2022
01:52:03,110 --> 01:52:04,370
I asked politely and it happened.

2023
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:04,690
Okay.

2024
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:05,790
That's all it needs.

2025
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:07,150
Get out of my head.

2026
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:09,230
What?

2027
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:20,940
Who is she?

2028
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:21,020
Creepy.

2029
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:26,680
Why is she living rent free in my head?

2030
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:27,700
Oh.

2031
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,020
Thor is angry.

2032
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:29,580
Angry.

2033
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:31,320
Sorry guys.

2034
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:33,720
I forgot to take my meds.

2035
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:37,400
Sometimes I see women pop up when that happens.

2036
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:44,670
Hello?

2037
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:48,130
See?

2038
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:51,310
You too.

2039
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:01,740
Alright.

2040
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:04,100
What's going on?

2041
01:53:05,740 --> 01:53:07,760
Am I at Hella yet?

2042
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:10,220
Is this Helheim?

2043
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:13,300
Oh.

2044
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:16,000
End of the road.

2045
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:22,960
It's the end of the road.

2046
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:26,880
Oh.

2047
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:30,500
Oh, this song is really spooky.

2048
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,000
I'm not feeling well.

2049
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:36,160
Oh my god.

2050
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:36,600
No.

2051
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,000
Wait.

2052
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:40,060
Wait.

2053
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:41,100
I forgot.

2054
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:43,600
Wait.

2055
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:48,060
Wait a minute.

2056
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:51,260
Oh fuck.

2057
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:53,400
Am I allowed to kill him?

2058
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,260
Oh.

2059
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:56,120
Is it heads?

2060
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:56,580
I don't remember.

2061
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:58,020
How do I sheath my...

2062
01:53:58,020 --> 01:53:59,160
How do I sheath it?

2063
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,640
Oh my god.

2064
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:04,560
Oh my god.

2065
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:05,700
Guys, give me a sec.

2066
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:07,060
Okay, now.

2067
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,880
Okay, now I remember.

2068
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:12,240
Guys, it's been so long.

2069
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:15,880
I don't remember.

2070
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:18,680
It's okay.

2071
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:19,320
Now I do.

2072
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:20,960
Get over here.

2073
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:22,780
Get over here.

2074
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,000
That's alright.

2075
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:27,340
I got it.

2076
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,440
Get out!

2077
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:32,240
That's right.

2078
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:38,480
Like, why would I ever need to use my hands until now?

2079
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,120
It's been so long since I used my fists.

2080
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,380
It's been so fucking long.

2081
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,600
I don't need my axe to kill you.

2082
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:51,900
Catch these hands.

2083
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:53,580
That's right.

2084
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:56,480
Oh, you thought you could just come out of the ground like that?

2085
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,420
You really thought so?

2086
01:54:58,480 --> 01:54:59,240
Oh shit.

2087
01:54:59,360 --> 01:54:59,600
Whoops.

2088
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:00,680
Give me a sec.

2089
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,240
Let me... Okay, give me a sec.

2090
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:03,280
Okay, there you go.

2091
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:04,400
Now, round two!

2092
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:10,080
Round two!

2093
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:16,500
That's right.

2094
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:17,020
Get over here.

2095
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:17,640
That's right.

2096
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,360
You saw what I did?

2097
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,240
Now it's your turn.

2098
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,180
Now it's your turn too.

2099
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:23,740
It's fine.

2100
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:25,380
That's fine.

2101
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:26,040
That's good.

2102
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:28,820
Get out!

2103
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:30,320
I'll suplex you!

2104
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,420
Okay, last guy.

2105
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:37,000
That's right.

2106
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,140
Save the best for last.

2107
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,040
Can you heal myself?

2108
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:45,240
Can you heal myself?

2109
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,240
That's not heals.

2110
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:49,620
And that should be my heals.

2111
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,260
Is there anything here?

2112
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:53,660
Oh, there is.

2113
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:57,960
Okay, I got an artifact.

2114
01:55:58,680 --> 01:55:59,820
Is there anything else here?

2115
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:01,700
Hello?

2116
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:03,820
Hello?

2117
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:08,800
Can't survive without child labor.

2118
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:11,580
Historically accurate.

2119
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:16,520
I'm just... I was so used to living the good life, guys.

2120
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:20,620
And now I have to fight for myself?

2121
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:25,380
Thank you for the super chat, John.

2122
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,400
Thank you.

2123
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,120
Okay, door open.

2124
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:44,050
Hello?

2125
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,120
What's in it?

2126
01:57:39,490 --> 01:57:43,250
Those are the original blades from the games!

2127
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:51,020
God, it looks dull as fuck.

2128
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,100
Oh, my hands are shaking.

2129
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:55,580
Oh no, I'm going through withdrawals right now.

2130
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,080
Oh, the Blade of Chaos!

2131
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,360
Teacher.

2132
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,200
Husband.

2133
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:21,940
Father.

2134
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:29,520
But there is one unavoidable truth you will never escape.

2135
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:32,440
You cannot change.

2136
01:58:34,180 --> 01:58:36,260
You will always be...

2137
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:37,380
A good father?

2138
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:38,340
A monster.

2139
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:42,260
I know.

2140
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,720
I thought I was doing a good job.

2141
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:47,200
But I am no longer a monster.

2142
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:01,140
Oh, it's time.

2143
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:03,820
It's fucking time!

2144
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:04,660
Let's go!

2145
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,280
Let's fucking go!

2146
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,400
Holy shit, why the fuck did I run away from my path?

2147
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:12,520
I look so cool!

2148
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:15,140
He said the thing.

2149
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:17,300
Oh, my God.

2150
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:20,780
I thought I was doing really well raising my boy.

2151
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:22,640
But I legitimately thought...

2152
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:23,940
Holy shit!

2153
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:26,960
And I was using a fucking axe?

2154
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,460
When I could have just done this?

2155
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:31,820
Let's go.

2156
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:34,560
Let's fucking go.

2157
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:39,820
I legitimately could have done so much more if I just got this out sooner.

2158
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,680
Let the chaos roam.

2159
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:44,900
That's fucking right.

2160
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:47,880
That's fucking right.

2161
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:50,400
I'm so fucking strong.

2162
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:58,440
If I'm gonna be the monster, I'm gonna be the best monster in this... in this world.

2163
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:02,940
That's fucking right.

2164
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,640
You guys are nothing!

2165
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,400
Oh, my God.

2166
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:09,000
The range is actually crazy, though.

2167
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,860
I could have killed so many people so much faster.

2168
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,100
Like, who cares about trauma?

2169
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:20,200
If I kill everything, then, like, I can't feel bad about stuff anymore.

2170
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,320
I'll just get Descent's Ties.

2171
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:33,140
Wait.

2172
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:35,760
Wait, Doki.

2173
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:37,320
Was it not here?

2174
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:40,380
Where's the shortcut?

2175
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:41,400
Oh, it's here.

2176
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:41,440
It's here.

2177
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:45,100
Okay.

2178
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:51,510
Holy shit!

2179
02:00:51,690 --> 02:00:53,570
Those blades are so strong.

2180
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:55,290
Where am I supposed to go?

2181
02:00:59,010 --> 02:01:01,750
Oh, did I forgot to unlock this?

2182
02:01:01,890 --> 02:01:03,670
Oh, that's silly of me.

2183
02:01:10,730 --> 02:01:12,450
Am I supposed to go back to the shop?

2184
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:15,210
Okay.

2185
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:22,310
Okay.

2186
02:01:32,990 --> 02:01:44,890
I knew you were Greek all along.

2187
02:01:45,230 --> 02:01:47,690
Why do they say it like it's a bad thing?

2188
02:01:50,110 --> 02:01:53,670
Why do they say it like it's bad that I'm Greek?

2189
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:21,150
What are those?

2190
02:02:25,010 --> 02:02:26,690
Don't worry about it.

2191
02:02:29,690 --> 02:02:32,230
I look like I'm always gonna cry at any moment.

2192
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:37,350
It was my sperm.

2193
02:02:37,650 --> 02:02:38,350
I'm sorry.

2194
02:02:38,730 --> 02:02:39,450
I'm sorry.

2195
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:47,310
Doki.

2196
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,210
Doki.

2197
02:02:59,350 --> 02:03:01,790
His son is dying, Doki.

2198
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:13,890
Alright, we gotta upgrade our... Can I upgrade my Blades of Chaos?

2199
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:18,290
I can't even upgrade my Blades of... What's the point?

2200
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:23,290
What the fuck is the point?

2201
02:03:25,090 --> 02:03:25,610
Alright.

2202
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:28,630
Alright, let's see.

2203
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:30,850
Can I... Do I have skills that I can upgrade?

2204
02:03:31,170 --> 02:03:32,270
Where's my Blades of Chaos?

2205
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:35,370
Oh, there we go.

2206
02:03:36,590 --> 02:03:38,510
Alright, let's just get everything.

2207
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:39,470
Fuck it.

2208
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:45,220
Get that.

2209
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:47,460
Get that.

2210
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:54,220
And then, I'm not good enough for the rest, so we'll just... We'll just not worry about that for now.

2211
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:56,660
Defense.

2212
02:03:56,660 --> 02:03:58,960
Let's get all the stronger ones.

2213
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,520
And then... Oh no, my nipples.

2214
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:03,940
No.

2215
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:07,100
No, I covered my nipples.

2216
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:07,880
No.

2217
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:10,840
Now I'm weak.

2218
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:13,540
I'm so weak now.

2219
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:17,080
My power.

2220
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:21,420
What do I do?

2221
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:24,860
I covered up my power.

2222
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:33,710
How do I free the nipple if it's covered up?

2223
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:44,940
Where is it?

2224
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:54,550
Okay.

2225
02:04:58,840 --> 02:04:59,840
Nephilim.

2226
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,580
Asgard.

2227
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:03,720
Where's Hela?

2228
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:04,760
Oh, Helam.

2229
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:05,320
There we go.

2230
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:07,180
Helam.

2231
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:10,340
Yay!

2232
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,980
How do I get there?

2233
02:05:19,610 --> 02:05:21,190
We're gonna get Hela unleashed.

2234
02:05:22,610 --> 02:05:24,210
Wait, why do I still have my axe?

2235
02:05:26,350 --> 02:05:27,850
Oh, there we go.

2236
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:42,900
Nice.

2237
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:44,240
I did it.

2238
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:50,280
How do I get across?

2239
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:51,020
Oh, there it is.

2240
02:05:54,580 --> 02:05:55,060
Okay.

2241
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:56,640
Alright, time to open the door.

2242
02:05:57,820 --> 02:05:58,360
Hello!

2243
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:01,560
Hey guys!

2244
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,360
Where's the welcome party?

2245
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:05,300
I'm Greek.

2246
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,540
Yeah, but I'm not Norse.

2247
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:26,360
I'm Greek, which is a lot warmer place, but like...

2248
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:28,600
But like, it's alright.

2249
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:43,980
What are you gonna do, huh?

2250
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:45,220
What you gonna do?

2251
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:47,900
I'm not even... Just fucking... Yeah, that's right.

2252
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:52,480
Guys, I'm only... Guys, I'm doing... I'm letting them have like the first hit, okay?

2253
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:53,700
Okay, guys!

2254
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,800
Chill out!

2255
02:06:58,540 --> 02:06:58,980
Alright.

2256
02:06:58,980 --> 02:06:59,420
Easy.

2257
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,440
Oh, this range is insane.

2258
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:05,200
Like, who cares about trauma, Kratos?

2259
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:08,400
You're fucking more badass with this.

2260
02:07:09,660 --> 02:07:12,740
Guys, I was just letting them get their first hit, okay, guys?

2261
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:15,760
I just want them to feel better about themselves.

2262
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:21,680
Damn, they gave us super chat!

2263
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:22,860
Thank you, thank you!

2264
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,220
Xcalibur, they gave us super chat!

2265
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:26,140
Thank you, thank you!

2266
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:27,940
Okay, there we go.

2267
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:30,020
Let's make sure... Come on!

2268
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:32,240
Burn, baby, burn!

2269
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,860
Burn, baby, burn!

2270
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:37,020
Let's go!

2271
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:38,480
Get out of here!

2272
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:41,820
It's alright.

2273
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:44,820
You're already in hell, so you might as well... You'll come back, right?

2274
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:47,120
Oh hey, nice!

2275
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:47,800
A chest.

2276
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:51,700
Yay!

2277
02:07:53,480 --> 02:07:55,260
Wait, is there another chest behind me?

2278
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:58,100
Did I miss it?

2279
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:01,420
There's no other chest, you liars!

2280
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:04,280
There's this!

2281
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:07,040
There was?

2282
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,080
Is there really another chest?

2283
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:13,500
How did I miss it?

2284
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:16,300
Oh wait, but I got this.

2285
02:08:16,380 --> 02:08:17,260
I didn't see this, though.

2286
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,780
Nice, I found the heirloom.

2287
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:26,460
Okay, but I need more money here.

2288
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:29,740
And is there anything here?

2289
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:33,080
Wait, there's a downstairs!

2290
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:35,320
What's downstairs?

2291
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:40,850
Oh, I can't open that yet.

2292
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:48,020
Alright, where is this chest that I missed?

2293
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:49,880
Where is it?

2294
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:53,500
Oh no.

2295
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:56,480
They said I'm really blind, so now I'm...

2296
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,200
Oh, it's right here.

2297
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:03,320
Okay, I may or may not be blind.

2298
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:07,220
Oh wait!

2299
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:12,960
Hold L1 and R1 together.

2300
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:14,840
L1 and R1.

2301
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:17,920
Oh shit!

2302
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:19,400
Wait, that's so cool!

2303
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:22,400
Okay.

2304
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:25,020
That's one of my other attacks.

2305
02:09:26,700 --> 02:09:27,860
And that's a cool attack.

2306
02:09:33,150 --> 02:09:33,550
Alright.

2307
02:09:34,650 --> 02:09:36,350
I can't do the attack, apparently.

2308
02:09:38,990 --> 02:09:41,410
Apparently, I can't do the- Oh shit, get away, get away!

2309
02:09:43,050 --> 02:09:45,070
Oh my god, oh my god, it's the jockey.

2310
02:09:47,330 --> 02:09:49,670
It's the fucking jockey from Left 4 Dead 2.

2311
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:54,090
Get whipped.

2312
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:55,050
That's right.

2313
02:09:55,250 --> 02:09:56,430
Go to your master!

2314
02:09:56,630 --> 02:09:57,870
Oh shit, oh shit!

2315
02:10:00,650 --> 02:10:01,610
That's right.

2316
02:10:01,790 --> 02:10:02,890
Go there!

2317
02:10:03,690 --> 02:10:05,050
Go to hell!

2318
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:06,470
Go to hell!

2319
02:10:14,490 --> 02:10:15,510
Oh shit.

2320
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:17,550
Hell is overwhelmed?

2321
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:20,590
Oh my god, there's an overpopulation.

2322
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:26,450
I can't believe there's a- There's an overpopulation of hell right now.

2323
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:29,350
We gotta call hell.

2324
02:10:31,090 --> 02:10:33,150
Guys, sorry, we have too many people.

2325
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:36,190
We have to take applications now.

2326
02:10:36,530 --> 02:10:37,710
Guys, there's a waitlist.

2327
02:10:38,850 --> 02:10:40,770
Hell is in demand.

2328
02:10:41,550 --> 02:10:43,870
Sorry guys, we have a waitlist.

2329
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:45,850
Please fill out the application.

2330
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:56,140
Okay, we need to go this way.

2331
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:00,380
How can hell be overpopulated?

2332
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:02,640
It should be like unlimited.

2333
02:11:11,170 --> 02:11:12,630
Oh, what's this?

2334
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:14,210
Oh, there's just more enemies.

2335
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:20,560
I killed too much.

2336
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,540
Honestly, yeah, maybe that's it.

2337
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:30,360
I killed too many people, so now they have an overpopulation problem.

2338
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:34,100
Oh my god, you fucking suck.

2339
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:36,440
God, I hate you.

2340
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:38,800
You can't shield forever.

2341
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:41,280
There's no way you can shield forever.

2342
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:42,760
There's no way.

2343
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:43,860
Ah, that's it.

2344
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:50,180
Oh my god, my chain still hits your shield?

2345
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:52,040
Oh, I hate you.

2346
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:54,560
Oh, I hate both of you.

2347
02:11:57,380 --> 02:11:59,600
Okay, I can't shield bash this.

2348
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:01,020
What?

2349
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:03,120
What do I do?

2350
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:12,400
There we go.

2351
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,380
There we go.

2352
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,820
I gotta bring an axe to this.

2353
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:20,360
Wait, what?

2354
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:24,340
Oh!

2355
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:32,940
Sorry, I don't know if you guys noticed this, but I don't use the shield at all.

2356
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:38,040
Like, what do I do when they also bring a shield to a fight?

2357
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:40,520
Those fucking pussies.

2358
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:47,570
Aww, this way.

2359
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:17,030
Can't go this way.

2360
02:13:21,230 --> 02:13:23,190
Alright, down I go.

2361
02:13:23,790 --> 02:13:25,230
Wait, there's a chest here.

2362
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:27,410
Where do I get this chest?

2363
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:30,990
Wait, there's a chest here.

2364
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:34,210
Hold L2 and aim.

2365
02:13:34,670 --> 02:13:37,090
Wait, I could've done this the entire time?

2366
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:40,890
Wait.

2367
02:13:41,130 --> 02:13:43,130
Okay, this will work.

2368
02:13:43,870 --> 02:13:44,490
Alright.

2369
02:13:45,070 --> 02:13:47,730
Oh my god, wait, that's so cool!

2370
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:49,730
Wait a minute!

2371
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:51,990
Wait, that's such a cool attack!

2372
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:56,570
Oh my god!

2373
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:57,870
Wait, that's so cool.

2374
02:13:58,270 --> 02:13:59,930
I like this attack a lot.

2375
02:14:02,430 --> 02:14:03,730
Get over here.

2376
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:09,940
Okay.

2377
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,140
That is so OP!

2378
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:18,710
Nice.

2379
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:21,770
Okay.

2380
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:26,190
Wait, I like this weapon.

2381
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:28,810
I like the blades so much more than the axe.

2382
02:14:29,390 --> 02:14:30,970
Why did I ever swap?

2383
02:14:31,270 --> 02:14:32,390
Who cares about trauma?

2384
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:34,050
I look cool.

2385
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:42,000
Wait, that's not...

2386
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:44,040
Wait, that wasn't supposed to...

2387
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,580
Wait a minute.

2388
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:46,480
That wasn't supposed to happen.

2389
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:47,140
Wait a...

2390
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:50,620
Wait a minute!

2391
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:53,720
I thought I could hook you!

2392
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:00,560
Excuse me, you were supposed to get hooked, buddy.

2393
02:15:01,740 --> 02:15:03,080
You know what, fuck this.

2394
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:04,220
I'm fucking angry now.

2395
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:06,220
Can't be bothered.

2396
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:07,700
Get over here.

2397
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:09,100
I'm gonna be angry.

2398
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:10,980
Get over here.

2399
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:15,660
Let's hope there's no boss fight where I need to use this power up.

2400
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:16,720
Wait.

2401
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:18,660
Wait, what?

2402
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:19,800
Oop!

2403
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:20,600
Oop!

2404
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:22,780
Oop!

2405
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:42,640
So being killed by a Greek?

2406
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:47,780
No, my son!

2407
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:53,280
It's dishonorable to grow old?

2408
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:58,120
Wait, that's fucked.

2409
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:02,720
How dare you live a good life and grow old?

2410
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:07,020
How fucking dare you?

2411
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,760
Alright, let's see.

2412
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:20,080
I don't know where to go, cause like...

2413
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:22,140
There's something over here too.

2414
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:27,220
I hope I'm going the right...

2415
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:29,340
I hope I'm going the side quest way.

2416
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:32,020
Okay, this is not it.

2417
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:47,960
Yeah, but I wanna go to areas where I can get loot.

2418
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:49,420
Oh wait, this is where I came from!

2419
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:50,520
Oh my god!

2420
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:50,900
Okay.

2421
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:51,820
Sorry.

2422
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:54,440
I'm a little special.

2423
02:16:56,780 --> 02:17:00,220
Look, I'm Greek, guys.

2424
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:01,340
It's fine.

2425
02:17:02,420 --> 02:17:03,760
I can make these mistakes.

2426
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:19,810
I was like, what?

2427
02:17:20,930 --> 02:17:25,430
If I die of old age and live a happy and prosperous life...

2428
02:17:25,430 --> 02:17:27,070
I... I fucked up.

2429
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:28,250
I go to hell.

2430
02:17:28,850 --> 02:17:30,270
How dare you?

2431
02:17:33,230 --> 02:17:35,030
You fucked up, Doki.

2432
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:37,010
You're not supposed to be happy.

2433
02:17:39,470 --> 02:17:42,530
Rip everyone 30 and over.

2434
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:44,950
Thank you for the super chat.

2435
02:17:45,570 --> 02:17:47,590
Darkblade, thank you, thank you.

2436
02:17:48,550 --> 02:17:50,110
I wanna get like the tree.

2437
02:17:51,150 --> 02:17:52,150
Where's the tree?

2438
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,230
Where's the tree?

2439
02:17:57,780 --> 02:17:58,960
Where's the tree?

2440
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:07,640
Wait, I can bring boy back here?

2441
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:09,780
I can bring boy to hell?

2442
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:12,120
That's right, boy, you fucked up.

2443
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:15,900
Who's that?

2444
02:18:22,220 --> 02:18:23,960
Oh, that's the keeper?

2445
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:31,420
I am not truly dead.

2446
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:33,740
Doesn't that make you angry?

2447
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:39,480
He's like, alive!

2448
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:41,220
Not dead!

2449
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:46,600
I am mad.

2450
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:53,070
You are not dead.

2451
02:18:53,150 --> 02:18:54,250
I am so mad.

2452
02:18:54,810 --> 02:18:56,150
What the fuck?

2453
02:18:58,550 --> 02:19:00,150
Okay, this is fucked up.

2454
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:00,770
Not gonna lie.

2455
02:19:03,350 --> 02:19:04,170
Where is he?

2456
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:06,570
What the fuck?

2457
02:19:06,690 --> 02:19:09,350
Okay, I need to...

2458
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:10,990
Okay, this is a little...

2459
02:19:10,990 --> 02:19:11,810
This is pretty bad.

2460
02:19:11,890 --> 02:19:12,870
This is actually pretty bad.

2461
02:19:13,030 --> 02:19:15,590
This is pretty...

2462
02:19:15,590 --> 02:19:18,410
This might be pretty bad.

2463
02:19:18,490 --> 02:19:19,050
Not gonna lie.

2464
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:25,130
Okay.

2465
02:19:26,150 --> 02:19:27,090
Okay, there you go.

2466
02:19:27,850 --> 02:19:28,790
Oh god, okay.

2467
02:19:29,890 --> 02:19:30,750
Oh, okay, we're done.

2468
02:19:30,750 --> 02:19:30,850
Oh god.

2469
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:31,990
What?

2470
02:19:34,470 --> 02:19:35,590
Oh my god.

2471
02:19:35,770 --> 02:19:36,490
Please!

2472
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:38,550
This fucker is a pussy!

2473
02:19:40,530 --> 02:19:42,090
Are you serious?

2474
02:19:44,890 --> 02:19:45,610
Okay.

2475
02:19:47,010 --> 02:19:48,210
Oh, I need...

2476
02:19:48,210 --> 02:19:48,850
I need heals.

2477
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:52,430
Okay.

2478
02:19:55,170 --> 02:19:55,890
Nice.

2479
02:19:56,250 --> 02:19:56,590
Nice.

2480
02:19:58,070 --> 02:20:00,070
Oh, you can't disappear forever!

2481
02:20:00,750 --> 02:20:01,330
Disappear!

2482
02:20:01,470 --> 02:20:02,010
Oh shit!

2483
02:20:03,050 --> 02:20:04,510
Okay, maybe he can.

2484
02:20:07,630 --> 02:20:07,950
Okay.

2485
02:20:09,290 --> 02:20:09,690
Okay.

2486
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:14,050
That's fucking right.

2487
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:15,630
That's right!

2488
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:17,790
You can't disappear forever!

2489
02:20:18,450 --> 02:20:19,190
Disappear!

2490
02:20:20,430 --> 02:20:21,690
Are you serious?

2491
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:25,970
Wait, that's stupid.

2492
02:20:26,110 --> 02:20:27,430
That's actually so dumb.

2493
02:20:29,850 --> 02:20:30,430
Oh!

2494
02:20:33,090 --> 02:20:34,110
Okay, we're fine.

2495
02:20:35,190 --> 02:20:36,210
We're so fine.

2496
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:38,070
Nice.

2497
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:41,010
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2498
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:43,350
No!

2499
02:20:43,890 --> 02:20:45,850
Are you serious?!

2500
02:20:46,430 --> 02:20:47,330
Oh my god.

2501
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:49,210
Okay, we gotta find heals.

2502
02:20:52,770 --> 02:20:53,350
Please!

2503
02:20:53,550 --> 02:20:53,890
No!

2504
02:20:54,810 --> 02:20:55,390
No!

2505
02:20:55,390 --> 02:20:55,550
No!

2506
02:20:58,310 --> 02:20:59,750
Oh, there's heals right here.

2507
02:21:02,290 --> 02:21:03,930
Oh, that's not a lot of heals.

2508
02:21:06,990 --> 02:21:08,350
Are you serious?

2509
02:21:10,590 --> 02:21:11,370
Oh no.

2510
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:15,640
Oh!

2511
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:17,560
No!

2512
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:21,750
Okay.

2513
02:21:23,170 --> 02:21:24,050
I don't...

2514
02:21:24,050 --> 02:21:26,070
Every time he does that, like, I...

2515
02:21:26,790 --> 02:21:28,990
I can't predict it properly.

2516
02:21:32,170 --> 02:21:32,810
Okay.

2517
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:38,420
Oh god.

2518
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:41,600
Where is he?

2519
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:46,580
Oh, where is he?

2520
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:48,720
Where is he?!

2521
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:54,360
Oh my god, you're such a whore!

2522
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,080
You're a pussy!

2523
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:57,520
Fight me like a man!

2524
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:03,320
You're actually such a pussy!

2525
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:12,060
Using magic?!

2526
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:13,140
Oh, fuck you.

2527
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:13,960
Help.

2528
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:15,580
No!

2529
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:23,520
Where is he?

2530
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:27,180
Come on!

2531
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:30,700
He's one-handed, he's one-handed, he's one-handed, he's one-handed!

2532
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:31,100
I'm gonna be greedy!

2533
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:33,360
I'm gonna be... Oh, I can't be greedy.

2534
02:22:35,740 --> 02:22:37,580
Are you serious?!

2535
02:22:37,580 --> 02:22:38,820
You're such a...

2536
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:51,710
I'm so...

2537
02:22:51,710 --> 02:22:53,850
Get over here, get over here, get over here!

2538
02:22:58,750 --> 02:23:00,270
Magic cringe!

2539
02:23:00,910 --> 02:23:03,210
You're so cringe for using magic!

2540
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:07,090
That's right.

2541
02:23:07,970 --> 02:23:09,110
First try.

2542
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:10,770
I'm angry.

2543
02:23:12,850 --> 02:23:14,730
I'm so angry.

2544
02:23:16,250 --> 02:23:17,610
Give me your heart.

2545
02:23:18,350 --> 02:23:21,250
It's not my problem what happens to Helen now.

2546
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:29,720
This is the real greatest.

2547
02:23:45,260 --> 02:23:47,140
The bridge will be fine, guys.

2548
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:50,320
I know they have an overpopulation problem, but it'll be fine.

2549
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:55,710
There we go.

2550
02:23:56,430 --> 02:23:57,350
For my son.

2551
02:24:00,950 --> 02:24:02,570
For my son!

2552
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:09,080
It'll sort itself naturally.

2553
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:14,060
Someone... It's like, you know, like...

2554
02:24:14,060 --> 02:24:16,560
Someone will always take over in the end.

2555
02:24:17,660 --> 02:24:19,140
It's like a power... What is it?

2556
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:20,700
Like...

2557
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:22,000
There's a word for it.

2558
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:24,560
When someone important dies, another person will take over.

2559
02:24:27,890 --> 02:24:30,670
Yeah, I'm sure there's a deputy bridge troll.

2560
02:24:32,390 --> 02:24:33,910
Yeah, power vacuum.

2561
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:35,690
It's alright.

2562
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:36,610
It has to be a...

2563
02:24:37,410 --> 02:24:38,330
Who's that?

2564
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:40,410
Watching me do all that?

2565
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:46,760
No witnesses.

2566
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:49,740
I have the heart.

2567
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:51,900
I need nothing more.

2568
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:52,640
You're set.

2569
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:54,620
Time not to linger here, though, eh?

2570
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,280
You think she saw?

2571
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:00,100
Kratos.

2572
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:02,980
Helium Zeus.

2573
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:06,980
My father.

2574
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:08,120
Your father was Zeus?

2575
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:10,640
Well, that explains a lot.

2576
02:25:13,380 --> 02:25:14,680
What is that place?

2577
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:16,940
Never go there.

2578
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:17,980
Understand?

2579
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:21,120
Oh, it's the place where she told me not to cross the bridge.

2580
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:27,820
How is he here?

2581
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:29,520
That is not possible.

2582
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:31,320
It's just an illusion.

2583
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:35,000
Hell's known for torturing its inhabitants with their own past.

2584
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:38,000
We should focus on getting back to your son.

2585
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:41,260
Okay, but like...

2586
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,700
But like...

2587
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:45,700
I have generational trauma.

2588
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:50,740
Wait, why am I still using this?

2589
02:25:55,460 --> 02:25:56,580
Alright, nice.

2590
02:25:57,420 --> 02:25:57,960
Let's see.

2591
02:25:58,020 --> 02:25:59,440
Let's grab some heals first.

2592
02:26:00,380 --> 02:26:01,300
Real quick.

2593
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:06,260
Let's grab some heals before we do anything.

2594
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:09,940
What does this do?

2595
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:10,800
There's like this...

2596
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:12,040
Oh, thank you for the raid!

2597
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:13,300
Thank you, thank you!

2598
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:18,180
I'm gonna beat up my dad right now.

2599
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:19,600
Give me a sec, guys.

2600
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:22,220
Oh, I can't.

2601
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:23,020
Wait, what the fuck?

2602
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:23,900
They baited me.

2603
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:30,380
How am I gonna relive my trauma if I can't even go there?

2604
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:32,920
I can't even cross...

2605
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:35,660
Why did they tease me with a good time?

2606
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:39,340
Wow.

2607
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:43,080
Fun fact, boy's daughter is canonically the ruler of hell.

2608
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:44,500
Thank you for the super chat, Patrick.

2609
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:45,540
Thank you, thank you.

2610
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:50,100
Wait, what?

2611
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:56,720
Oh, he's gonna upgrade it.

2612
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:02,900
Uh, Giga, thank you for the super chat.

2613
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:03,720
Thank you, thank you.

2614
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:05,940
Greedus doesn't have the death pass.

2615
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:07,420
Therefore, they're angry.

2616
02:27:07,740 --> 02:27:08,800
Thank you for the super chat.

2617
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:09,740
Thank you, thank you.

2618
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:11,760
Arcturus, thank you for the super chat.

2619
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:12,580
Thank you, thank you.

2620
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:17,960
I asked why he's angry, but you wouldn't know who I'm referring to.

2621
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:19,920
Thank you for the super chat.

2622
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:20,780
Thank you, thank you.

2623
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:22,600
Oh, I can do this now.

2624
02:27:25,740 --> 02:27:26,260
Oh.

2625
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:30,340
Reverent and stable can only be held for 10 seconds.

2626
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:30,880
Oh!

2627
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:36,660
What?

2628
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:42,820
The transfer?

2629
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:45,320
Huh?

2630
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:50,930
Hold L2?

2631
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:55,410
But like, where am I transferring it to?

2632
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:05,250
What?

2633
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:10,660
What door?

2634
02:28:14,900 --> 02:28:15,560
Oh!

2635
02:28:15,980 --> 02:28:16,700
Sorry.

2636
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:16,900
Sorry.

2637
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:23,020
Sorry, I didn't see the other ball.

2638
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:27,060
Sorry, I didn't see the ball in front of me.

2639
02:28:28,300 --> 02:28:29,500
Okay, I realize now.

2640
02:28:29,620 --> 02:28:30,560
Guys, I'm so smart.

2641
02:28:30,660 --> 02:28:31,420
I figured it out.

2642
02:28:32,580 --> 02:28:33,760
Don't worry, guys!

2643
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:39,040
Now you can come in the hell!

2644
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:43,460
It's a free country!

2645
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:48,240
Who cares about overpopulation?

2646
02:28:48,580 --> 02:28:49,620
Welcome to hell!

2647
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,240
Anybody is welcome!

2648
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:55,520
I have opened the borders for all of you!

2649
02:28:56,260 --> 02:28:58,960
Surely nothing bad will happen if I do that.

2650
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,100
Right, guys?

2651
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:06,820
Surely I'm not going to cause more issues now.

2652
02:29:10,860 --> 02:29:11,620
Alright.

2653
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:13,780
Uh...

2654
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:16,660
Is there anything up here?

2655
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:21,700
I wonder if like...

2656
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:24,920
Just like my blades can't bring my boy back here.

2657
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:28,140
What could go wrong?

2658
02:29:29,140 --> 02:29:31,320
Exactly, nothing could go wrong.

2659
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:35,700
Uh...

2660
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:37,760
Wait, there's like stuff here.

2661
02:29:39,660 --> 02:29:41,520
Okay, let's transfer this over.

2662
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,620
Oh shit, I used the wrong... whoops!

2663
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:46,080
Yeah, fuck that place in particular.

2664
02:29:49,480 --> 02:29:51,340
Okay, get the wind here.

2665
02:29:52,380 --> 02:29:54,140
And then wind over here.

2666
02:29:58,360 --> 02:30:00,020
Okay, I just need to make sure...

2667
02:30:00,020 --> 02:30:02,860
I need to make sure I kill all these guys first.

2668
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:05,920
That's fucking right.

2669
02:30:06,820 --> 02:30:07,340
BEGONE!

2670
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:07,560
BEGONE!

2671
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:10,180
I killed... oh shit, okay.

2672
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:14,200
I killed your boss, you think I'm afraid of you?

2673
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:15,100
You know what?

2674
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:15,940
Get over here.

2675
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:16,900
That's fucking right.

2676
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:18,580
Oh shit.

2677
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:20,580
Get over here, I killed your boss.

2678
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:22,960
Now you're not gonna get paid.

2679
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:28,360
Alright, nice.

2680
02:30:29,940 --> 02:30:30,440
Uh...

2681
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:31,300
Okay, I need the heals.

2682
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:36,200
And then...

2683
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:42,360
Wait, I can't take this back?

2684
02:30:47,070 --> 02:30:48,070
Oh yeah, but what if...

2685
02:30:48,070 --> 02:30:49,170
Okay, I was gonna say...

2686
02:30:49,170 --> 02:30:51,890
What if I just go really, really fast?

2687
02:30:53,050 --> 02:30:55,110
Oh, I can't take it back.

2688
02:30:57,970 --> 02:30:59,610
Why can't I take it back?

2689
02:31:04,840 --> 02:31:06,680
Alright, I guess we go this way.

2690
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,760
Oh, I figured it out!

2691
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,700
I can't go back.

2692
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:24,100
Oh wait.

2693
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:25,580
Oh, it's a puzzle?

2694
02:31:27,980 --> 02:31:29,340
Wait, I know what to do.

2695
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:36,000
I figured it out.

2696
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:43,280
I figured it out.

2697
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:47,680
Ha ha ha!

2698
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:51,380
I was like wondering what that staircase was for.

2699
02:31:54,240 --> 02:31:55,240
Okay, nice.

2700
02:31:57,660 --> 02:31:58,420
I'm so smart.

2701
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:02,600
That's right, you thought just because you died in hell that your grave would be safe?

2702
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:03,580
That's fucking right.

2703
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:05,780
I'm so smart.

2704
02:32:09,580 --> 02:32:10,100
Uh...

2705
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:12,180
Thank you, thank you.

2706
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:15,320
Oh, I know about the six-legged horse.

2707
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:16,820
I learned about that as a child.

2708
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:22,720
He gave birth to a horse and then his dad decided to use it as his fucking steed.

2709
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:25,740
Which is pretty weird.

2710
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:28,600
That's a pretty weird thing for his dad to do.

2711
02:32:33,260 --> 02:32:34,440
Not gonna lie.

2712
02:32:42,150 --> 02:32:44,450
The border is now open!

2713
02:32:44,450 --> 02:32:45,270
Come in!

2714
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:48,610
Come in, everybody!

2715
02:32:49,470 --> 02:32:52,370
Hell is now free to come in!

2716
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:54,950
That's right.

2717
02:32:55,730 --> 02:32:58,470
Nothing bad will happen now.

2718
02:33:02,450 --> 02:33:05,790
Borders are open to everybody.

2719
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:09,110
There's no problem.

2720
02:33:10,090 --> 02:33:11,550
We don't have a...

2721
02:33:11,550 --> 02:33:12,650
Oh, I should not have...

2722
02:33:13,410 --> 02:33:16,750
I don't know why I decided to try and fight this guy.

2723
02:33:19,350 --> 02:33:20,770
Oh my god.

2724
02:33:21,010 --> 02:33:22,730
He was actually just chilling.

2725
02:33:23,210 --> 02:33:24,110
I was like, you know what, no.

2726
02:33:24,230 --> 02:33:25,290
Fuck you in particular.

2727
02:33:26,130 --> 02:33:27,150
Fuck it, let's go.

2728
02:33:27,570 --> 02:33:28,830
Let's fucking brawl.

2729
02:33:29,230 --> 02:33:30,190
Let's go.

2730
02:33:32,930 --> 02:33:34,550
I'm gonna kick your ass.

2731
02:33:35,170 --> 02:33:38,130
I could have used this on like, you know...

2732
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:39,910
The actual boss fight.

2733
02:33:40,570 --> 02:33:41,850
But I could take you.

2734
02:33:41,850 --> 02:33:43,570
I know I could take you.

2735
02:33:46,550 --> 02:33:47,530
Oh shit.

2736
02:33:47,910 --> 02:33:48,930
Oh shit.

2737
02:33:50,750 --> 02:33:52,330
I think I can take you.

2738
02:33:52,470 --> 02:33:53,170
That's fucking right.

2739
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:55,570
Oh, you think you're good?

2740
02:33:56,030 --> 02:33:57,350
You're in hell, baby.

2741
02:33:59,370 --> 02:34:00,450
There we go.

2742
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:02,350
Nice.

2743
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:03,730
Red blade.

2744
02:34:04,550 --> 02:34:04,870
Oh.

2745
02:34:06,110 --> 02:34:09,050
Low perk chance to grant a gift of strength.

2746
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:10,090
Oh, I like that.

2747
02:34:10,310 --> 02:34:11,030
That sounds cool.

2748
02:34:11,950 --> 02:34:12,990
I'm gaming.

2749
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:20,740
Nice.

2750
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:22,500
These guys are like little babies.

2751
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:23,800
So like, I'm not too afraid.

2752
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:24,580
Not gonna...

2753
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:27,520
Impale.

2754
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:28,200
Press.

2755
02:34:28,380 --> 02:34:28,860
Wait, what?

2756
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:31,380
Oh, you mean like this.

2757
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:34,320
What are you doing?

2758
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:35,540
Get over here.

2759
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,060
What the fuck?

2760
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:38,420
Okay, that's...

2761
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:40,140
That's a little bit overkill.

2762
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:41,920
Get over here.

2763
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:43,600
Get over here.

2764
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:45,040
That's right.

2765
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:45,760
And again.

2766
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:46,340
Again.

2767
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:47,340
And again.

2768
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:51,460
Alright.

2769
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:52,120
Nice.

2770
02:34:52,580 --> 02:34:53,200
You did it.

2771
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:57,120
I'm locked in now.

2772
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:58,400
Oh, wait.

2773
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:00,260
I can use this to open the other area.

2774
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:06,120
Wait.

2775
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:07,080
Oh, I thought that was fire.

2776
02:35:07,140 --> 02:35:07,500
Nevermind.

2777
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:08,560
I thought that was wind already.

2778
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:09,900
My bad.

2779
02:35:15,350 --> 02:35:16,870
And off I go.

2780
02:35:20,260 --> 02:35:22,180
Oh, fuck you in particular.

2781
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:24,480
Like...

2782
02:35:24,480 --> 02:35:26,720
I know that was my special move.

2783
02:35:27,060 --> 02:35:28,840
But fuck you in particular.

2784
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:29,660
And you too.

2785
02:35:30,140 --> 02:35:30,760
And again.

2786
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:32,960
Armed and dangerous.

2787
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:34,140
Again.

2788
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:36,760
Again.

2789
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:39,000
Again.

2790
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:45,520
There we go.

2791
02:35:46,140 --> 02:35:46,420
Nice.

2792
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:50,860
Oh, you think...

2793
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:52,320
You think you can get away with that?

2794
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:53,180
Hold on.

2795
02:35:54,300 --> 02:35:55,520
That's fucking right.

2796
02:35:57,700 --> 02:35:59,100
Oh my god, do you think he's okay?

2797
02:36:01,980 --> 02:36:02,940
Alright, nice.

2798
02:36:03,740 --> 02:36:04,160
Easy.

2799
02:36:05,240 --> 02:36:06,340
We go back now.

2800
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:07,520
Oh, he is...

2801
02:36:08,980 --> 02:36:10,020
She's regressing.

2802
02:36:10,540 --> 02:36:10,880
God.

2803
02:36:11,980 --> 02:36:12,960
What the fuck?

2804
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:13,620
What do you mean?

2805
02:36:18,520 --> 02:36:21,160
I'm just utilizing the best move in this game.

2806
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:25,060
That's fucking right.

2807
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,720
And again.

2808
02:36:29,700 --> 02:36:30,800
And again.

2809
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:31,780
Get over here.

2810
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:33,860
That's fucking right.

2811
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:36,540
I'll use it against you.

2812
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:41,020
This is somehow a Marvel Rivalry.

2813
02:36:46,490 --> 02:36:47,350
Alright, nice.

2814
02:36:47,910 --> 02:36:48,750
We made it back.

2815
02:36:52,370 --> 02:36:55,030
Alright, I should be able to upgrade my...

2816
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:56,650
Yeah, my Blades of Chaos now.

2817
02:36:56,770 --> 02:36:57,030
Yay!

2818
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:01,230
Yeah!

2819
02:37:03,670 --> 02:37:05,810
Okay, now that I upgraded...

2820
02:37:05,810 --> 02:37:08,490
I can upgrade my skills, right?

2821
02:37:12,190 --> 02:37:13,570
Where's my blade?

2822
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:14,690
There we go.

2823
02:37:15,430 --> 02:37:16,670
Might as well just upgrade everything.

2824
02:37:16,770 --> 02:37:17,490
I can afford it.

2825
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:24,750
Okay, nice.

2826
02:37:28,220 --> 02:37:29,920
Alright, back home I go.

2827
02:37:33,810 --> 02:37:36,010
Boy, I'm coming back, boy.

2828
02:37:38,130 --> 02:37:39,990
Daddy's gonna come back.

2829
02:37:42,850 --> 02:37:44,190
Did you see what it does?

2830
02:37:44,430 --> 02:37:45,070
Oh shit!

2831
02:37:45,130 --> 02:37:45,890
Oh wait, that's not right.

2832
02:37:46,010 --> 02:37:46,870
I was like, whoa!

2833
02:37:47,990 --> 02:37:48,470
Whoa!

2834
02:37:51,650 --> 02:37:52,590
Okay, that's cool.

2835
02:37:55,030 --> 02:37:56,190
Alright, nice.

2836
02:37:56,290 --> 02:37:57,530
That's a cool spin attack.

2837
02:37:58,790 --> 02:37:59,570
Spin!

2838
02:38:02,270 --> 02:38:04,730
How do I go back home?

2839
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:11,960
Oh, Midgard!

2840
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:14,760
Sorry.

2841
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:16,960
I was like, where's home?

2842
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:19,460
I finally understand!

2843
02:38:19,940 --> 02:38:23,840
I'm dangling from the hip of the bloody ghost of Sparta!

2844
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:25,660
Do not call me that.

2845
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:27,900
Am I supposed to be allowed to see...

2846
02:38:29,140 --> 02:38:30,340
Like, see Zeus?

2847
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:33,160
Or like, is that something in the future?

2848
02:38:34,260 --> 02:38:36,520
But you really can't stay away from him, can you?

2849
02:38:37,140 --> 02:38:38,860
You must say nothing to the boy.

2850
02:38:39,440 --> 02:38:41,940
He must never know he's Greek.

2851
02:38:42,640 --> 02:38:44,220
I'm so fucked.

2852
02:38:44,220 --> 02:38:46,220
He has to know.

2853
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:48,460
He'll never be whole without the truth.

2854
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:51,040
Look, I get it.

2855
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:52,380
You hate the gods.

2856
02:38:52,660 --> 02:38:54,000
All gods.

2857
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:55,160
It's no accident.

2858
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:56,220
That includes yourself.

2859
02:38:56,680 --> 02:38:58,500
And it includes your boy.

2860
02:38:59,080 --> 02:38:59,780
Do you see that?

2861
02:39:00,280 --> 02:39:01,420
He feels that.

2862
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:03,520
He can't help what he is.

2863
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:07,060
He can't begin to help it because you haven't even told him.

2864
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:09,280
It's all connected, man.

2865
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:10,000
He can't know.

2866
02:39:10,180 --> 02:39:12,060
You will tell him nothing.

2867
02:39:12,060 --> 02:39:13,700
He can't know he's half Greek.

2868
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:20,820
It will break him if he finds out that he's not pure blood.

2869
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:33,030
He made it better?

2870
02:39:34,990 --> 02:39:35,610
What'd he do?

2871
02:39:37,230 --> 02:39:38,710
Well, he broke it.

2872
02:39:45,610 --> 02:39:48,730
If I didn't break it, then we can take it to Freya.

2873
02:39:52,050 --> 02:39:55,210
Wait, can I go straight to Freya?

2874
02:39:59,350 --> 02:40:00,270
Oh, there it is.

2875
02:40:00,330 --> 02:40:00,890
Oh, I can!

2876
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:01,330
I can!

2877
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:14,260
Yay!

2878
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:20,020
I can just walk to Freya now.

2879
02:40:22,220 --> 02:40:22,840
Finally,

2880
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:30,240
it only took four playthroughs to unlock fast travel.

2881
02:40:31,400 --> 02:40:32,580
I mean, it's almost there.

2882
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:35,720
It's literally next door.

2883
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:37,620
What do you mean it isn't right?

2884
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:38,960
It's literally right here.

2885
02:40:40,380 --> 02:40:42,180
I did it, Freya.

2886
02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:43,880
I got the heart.

2887
02:40:45,980 --> 02:40:47,520
I lost your boat, though.

2888
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:52,460
That's so much walking.

2889
02:40:57,900 --> 02:40:59,360
He must not know.

2890
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:09,900
Yeah, no fucking shit.

2891
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:10,700
He's like...

2892
02:41:11,560 --> 02:41:13,040
He's white as hell.

2893
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:19,420
You're a god, boy.

2894
02:41:19,880 --> 02:41:20,540
I'm a what?

2895
02:41:25,020 --> 02:41:25,700
Oh,

2896
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:37,780
I killed him.

2897
02:41:38,860 --> 02:41:39,480
Oh, wait, no.

2898
02:41:39,480 --> 02:41:40,380
I killed your grandson.

2899
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:04,780
Oh, that's awkward, man.

2900
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:06,500
That's pretty awkward.

2901
02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:08,300
I guess I won't tell you who I just killed.

2902
02:42:16,820 --> 02:42:19,280
Is that how the medicine works?

2903
02:42:19,580 --> 02:42:19,720
Fears?

2904
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:22,360
Feed the medicine to my fucking boy.

2905
02:42:33,100 --> 02:42:33,900
Oh,

2906
02:42:50,310 --> 02:42:51,270
shit, he's alive.

2907
02:42:57,180 --> 02:42:58,960
Boy, I have something to tell you.

2908
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:01,680
You're a half-kreek.

2909
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:02,620
I'm sorry.

2910
02:43:02,820 --> 02:43:03,740
I'm sorry.

2911
02:43:03,860 --> 02:43:04,960
I know this is a serious moment.

2912
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:05,820
I'm sorry, guys.

2913
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:09,660
Okay, boy, I actually do have something serious to tell you.

2914
02:43:26,610 --> 02:43:29,130
I'm sorry to find out this late.

2915
02:43:32,690 --> 02:43:34,370
I thought I was supposed to tell him, Freya.

2916
02:43:34,430 --> 02:43:34,970
What happened?

2917
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:50,700
I'm not gonna tell him?

2918
02:43:53,500 --> 02:43:55,700
Oh, I might need, like, an actual moment.

2919
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:03,640
I guess, like, I have to give him, like, a moment.

2920
02:44:03,900 --> 02:44:05,220
Like, a special moment.

2921
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:19,980
Oh, okay.

2922
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:20,460
Sorry.

2923
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:22,200
We gotta find a nice place.

2924
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:36,940
Aww.

2925
02:44:47,440 --> 02:44:48,120
Aww.

2926
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:57,900
That's why you should've signed a prenup.

2927
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:18,960
Oh, that's fucked.

2928
02:45:19,860 --> 02:45:21,320
That was, like, a really bad guy.

2929
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:23,300
Press zero.

2930
02:45:24,380 --> 02:45:25,100
Nothing happened.

2931
02:45:49,290 --> 02:45:50,830
Alright, son.

2932
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:52,690
Alright, boy.

2933
02:45:53,710 --> 02:45:56,490
Now that you're fixed up...

2934
02:45:56,490 --> 02:45:58,730
It's time to go back to the grind.

2935
02:46:01,010 --> 02:46:02,690
That is not a door.

2936
02:46:04,940 --> 02:46:07,690
I thought there was multiple doors.

2937
02:46:07,890 --> 02:46:08,490
I'm sorry.

2938
02:46:09,390 --> 02:46:11,350
We gotta go this way.

2939
02:46:20,110 --> 02:46:21,250
Alright, boy.

2940
02:46:36,870 --> 02:46:40,970
Oh, what's going on?

2941
02:46:41,190 --> 02:46:42,830
Boy, why are you so depressed?

2942
02:46:43,290 --> 02:46:43,850
Alright, guys.

2943
02:46:44,530 --> 02:46:46,410
I think this is a good place to call it here.

2944
02:46:47,330 --> 02:46:48,450
We got a lot done.

2945
02:46:48,890 --> 02:46:51,350
I think this is a good place.

2946
02:46:51,870 --> 02:46:52,910
We fixed the boy.

2947
02:46:53,450 --> 02:46:54,410
He's okay now.

2948
02:46:54,650 --> 02:46:54,730
He's okay now.

2949
02:46:54,730 --> 02:46:54,750
He's okay now.

2950
02:46:58,280 --> 02:46:59,960
Aww, that was fun, though.

2951
02:47:00,380 --> 02:47:01,660
That was really fun.

2952
02:47:02,520 --> 02:47:06,760
I really enjoyed this part of the game.

2953
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:11,980
I think the Chaos Blades was really fun to use.

2954
02:47:12,240 --> 02:47:14,920
I would've wanted to stream longer, but my voice is dying, guys.

2955
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:17,940
My voice is dying right now.

2956
02:47:18,220 --> 02:47:19,740
So I gotta rest up.

2957
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:21,400
But thank you, everybody.

2958
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:23,600
I'm sorry I started this stream late today.

2959
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:26,540
I really, really needed that nap.

2960
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:30,240
But I still hope you guys had fun watching, even though the stream was late.

2961
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:32,140
I really enjoyed that chapter.

2962
02:47:32,700 --> 02:47:39,380
I really liked that chapter, because I felt like I liked the story behind that chapter in general.

2963
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:43,500
So that's definitely one of my favorite parts currently so far.

2964
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:46,920
Currently so far in The God of War.

2965
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:50,700
Arcturus, thank you for the super chat.

2966
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:51,380
Thank you, thank you.

2967
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:52,320
Not so fun fact.

2968
02:47:52,460 --> 02:47:55,020
The Blades of Chaos are eternally bound... I think it's a curse, right?

2969
02:47:55,420 --> 02:47:56,080
Bound to Kratos.

2970
02:47:56,460 --> 02:48:01,540
No matter how many times he tries to rid himself of them during his journey from Greece to Midgard, they always return to them.

2971
02:48:01,760 --> 02:48:02,540
Thank you for the super chat.

2972
02:48:02,620 --> 02:48:03,380
Thank you, thank you.

2973
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:05,560
Anyway, thank you all for coming.

2974
02:48:06,140 --> 02:48:09,240
I wish I could stream longer, but my voice is actually dying right now.

2975
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:13,160
So I need to rest up.

2976
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:17,180
Hey guys, as always, everybody...

2977
02:48:17,180 --> 02:48:21,360
Stay hydrated, posture check, get moving around to get that blood flowing.

2978
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:25,100
And if you're suffering me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

2979
02:48:25,240 --> 02:48:26,560
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

2980
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:27,680
Bye, guys.

2981
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:28,380
Bye!
