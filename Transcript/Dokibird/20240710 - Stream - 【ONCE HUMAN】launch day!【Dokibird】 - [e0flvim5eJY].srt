1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:03,620
Hello,

2
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,960
everybody!

3
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,600
Hello, hello!

4
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,220
Welcome to Once Human!

5
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,180
So, you guys might notice that Tengen is muted right now.

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,640
Because we found out that we can't instantly play multiplayer.

7
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,640
We have to do like a little... we have to do a little tutorial first.

8
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,780
Like, in the first 15 minutes.

9
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,280
So, because of that, we were like, okay, I'm gonna meet you when we're done with the tutorial.

10
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,600
And when we find each other.

11
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,520
So, like, what you guys see, like your first time seeing Tengen, will be my first time seeing Tengen in game.

12
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,160
Because he was like, I don't want to show my chat what I made.

13
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,480
So, we're gonna see that together, guys.

14
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,920
The first hand reaction together.

15
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,240
And that is why he is muted at the moment.

16
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,640
He's like, alright, when we see each other, we unmute.

17
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,580
So, Once Human.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,080
Apparently, it is a... the newest third...

19
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,520
I know I wrote like... at first I thought it was first person.

20
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,900
And I realized it was third person.

21
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,560
So, then I had like edited my tweet like three times.

22
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,620
Because like the first time I edited it, it was like grammar mistake.

23
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,800
The second time I edited it, I was like, oh, it's a shooter game and not an FPS game.

24
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,460
So...

25
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,120
I edited my tweet multiple times.

26
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,440
Because I kept making mistakes.

27
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,540
Anyway, so Once Human is the newest shooter game.

28
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,220
Newest PvE shooter game.

29
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,800
Extraction shit or whatever.

30
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,660
And like today, we're gonna figure out...

31
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,700
This is launch day.

32
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,240
Launch today.

33
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,760
I've always seen a lot of trailers of this leading up to Once Human.

34
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,560
And like, you know, it finally launched today.

35
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,800
And judging by the...

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,820
Judging by the reviews...

37
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,520
It might die soon.

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,280
Judging by what the reviews were saying.

39
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,440
It doesn't look...

40
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,240
It doesn't look too promising.

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,740
It does have PvP and PvE.

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,500
But we're gonna be doing PvE.

43
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,280
Because Tenjin was like...

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,100
He was scared of getting stream sniped and killed lots of times.

45
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,280
So like...

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,400
Okay, he didn't say that.

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,700
But that's what I assumed.

48
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,180
Because he didn't choose...

49
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,440
I let him pick the server.

50
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,000
And I was like PvE, not PvP.

51
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,940
And he's like, yeah, PvE.

52
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,280
So he's a little bitch.

53
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,400
So...

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,360
He's a little bitch boy.

55
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,020
And doesn't want to risk playing PvP.

56
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,400
Yeah, that's what I heard in my head.

57
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,080
When he was like, we're doing PvE.

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,080
Anyway...

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,680
Most likely...

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,860
It's free to play though.

61
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,600
Like...

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,820
Once human is free to play.

63
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,060
So that's like the great part about it.

64
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,260
It is free to play.

65
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,520
But like...

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,480
It has mixed reviews right now.

67
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,200
So...

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,260
I don't know.

69
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,840
Apparently a lot of it was because it's like cosmetics.

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,800
Like...

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,700
A lot of stuff is like locked behind a paywall.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,860
But like...

73
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,320
That's usually what I expect from free to play.

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,600
Usually in free to play it's...

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,520
You know, a lot of stuff is locked behind...

76
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,020
Um...

77
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,240
Locked behind...

78
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,720
Uh...

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,540
Behind stuff.

80
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,200
So...

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,840
Yeah...

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
Um...

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,280
We'll see.

84
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,720
We'll see.

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,760
I was gonna like...

86
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,560
I went in.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,180
I was like, okay, we're gonna go in.

88
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:29,820
Oh my gosh.

89
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,280
Why is there like zero bars?

90
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,060
Anyway...

91
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,640
Anyway...

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,780
Okay...

93
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,660
And then there's server issues apparently too.

94
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,740
Where people are waiting for a very long time to get into the server.

95
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,740
But I sort of expected that for a game that came out on launch.

96
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,880
There's a hand.

97
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,090
Whoa!

98
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,320
Our world is broken.

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,440
Stagnant.

100
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,660
Fallen into the abyss.

101
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,510
But everything is born from darkness.

102
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,850
Even the universe itself.

103
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,290
Now...

104
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,470
Alright, I'll turn up this.

105
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,130
The spark of life still burns.

106
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,790
Alright.

107
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,170
And evolution forges a new way forward.

108
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,210
I raised it a bit more.

109
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,350
What's the lore that we're never gonna pay attention to after this?

110
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,190
Cuss scene.

111
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,950
Yeah, I was gonna say it feels like Kingdom Hearts.

112
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,290
It really does.

113
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,550
Once you move beyond death.

114
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,210
Once life returns to this world.

115
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,610
This feels like...

116
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,870
Where's the door of darkness?

117
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,830
Oh my god.

118
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,970
This is the Keyblade Cemetery right here.

119
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,990
Beyond that path.

120
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,090
Keyblade but with guns.

121
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,250
Kingdom Hearts should add guns into its game.

122
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,570
That's how it's gonna improve.

123
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,590
The reason why Kingdom Hearts 3 was not as good as 1 and 2...

124
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,490
Was because the audience grew up and now they just want gun.

125
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,350
Change my mind.

126
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,830
Alright.

127
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:52,830
Oh my god.

128
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,650
Okay, this is like...

129
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,590
It's NetEase, right?

130
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,870
So yeah, this looks like a NetEase game.

131
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,990
I can tell.

132
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,750
I can tell because like...

133
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,050
You can tell when certain games are made.

134
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,730
Whichever company made whichever games.

135
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,110
Due to the fact of the faces.

136
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,130
This is the NetEase style.

137
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:22,990
I can tell.

138
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,850
Or Nexon, yeah.

139
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,250
It's either NetEase or Nexon.

140
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,090
I can recognize the faces.

141
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,630
You know what I mean?

142
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:38,770
Each company has its own very distinct customization when it comes to humans.

143
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,130
I'm like, yeah, that looks like a NetEase or Nexon game.

144
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,690
Alright, can I make me?

145
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,670
Okay.

146
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,910
Oh, this is RetroDoki right there.

147
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,210
Well, I don't know.

148
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,550
I don't know.

149
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,990
All the faces are like...

150
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,090
Can I say that?

151
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,330
I feel like they're all like...

152
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,610
So are the guys too.

153
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,830
All the faces are very similar.

154
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,790
Alright, let's see.

155
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,990
Okay, face.

156
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,170
Alright.

157
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,170
Oh my god.

158
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,130
It's...

159
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,750
Okay, like these games have like...

160
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,310
Insane customization as well.

161
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,670
Like because...

162
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,390
What the fuck?

163
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,970
Oh my god.

164
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,530
Okay, we need like a really small head.

165
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,430
Oh my god.

166
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,850
There's too many things.

167
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,970
Forehead, tempo, hairline, jaw, jaw.

168
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,650
Jesus Christ, am I playing in like MMO?

169
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,530
Is this an MMO right now?

170
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,330
Alright.

171
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,610
Guys, the smaller the head, the smaller the...

172
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,810
The hip box.

173
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,510
Guys, believe in me.

174
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,730
The smaller the head, the smaller the hip box.

175
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,790
This is our...

176
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,850
You got even done!

177
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,330
Is it the hair?

178
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,170
Okay, let's get rid of the hair and just see like does it make a difference.

179
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,510
It has... Okay.

180
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,510
Alright.

181
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,810
Okay, we'll fix the hair later.

182
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,550
I just want to know if there's like any...

183
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,430
If I could... If there's any difference.

184
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,350
Like I can't tell.

185
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,470
I can't tell if I'm making any...

186
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,710
Oh my god.

187
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,550
The head is a little dented here.

188
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,610
Like...

189
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,570
Oh my god.

190
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,350
What are the changes?

191
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,950
Oh, here.

192
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,370
There's... I see it.

193
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,770
I see the change right now.

194
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,070
Oh my god.

195
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,230
Okay, there's a little...

196
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,110
There's a little dent in here too.

197
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,390
Holy shit.

198
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,130
Okay.

199
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,030
Alright.

200
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,630
At least...

201
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,450
You know what?

202
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:00,870
Alright.

203
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,750
There we go.

204
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,630
Oh my god.

205
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,890
You know how like when you wear headphones, there's like a little... like the gamer dent?

206
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,850
Yeah, like I wear the headphones the wrong way.

207
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,190
Oh no.

208
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,390
Oh my god.

209
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,250
It's so bad here.

210
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,170
Oh my god.

211
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,430
Okay.

212
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,610
Alright.

213
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,330
Let's see.

214
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,530
The tempo...

215
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,930
Oh no.

216
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,870
No!

217
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,470
Okay.

218
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,990
We should not do that actually.

219
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,210
Alright.

220
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,470
Tempo size.

221
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,150
Okay.

222
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,050
Yes.

223
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,830
The smaller...

224
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,270
We gotta minimize the...

225
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,290
We gotta minimize the...

226
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,790
The hitbox as much as we can, guys.

227
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,350
As much as we can.

228
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,870
Okay.

229
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,830
Alright.

230
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,450
There we go.

231
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,650
Uh...

232
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,070
Ooh.

233
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,530
She's mewing.

234
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,550
Okay.

235
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,880
Okay.

236
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,000
I should like that.

237
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah.

238
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,860
Alright.

239
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,180
Successful mewing right there.

240
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,600
What the fuck is mewing?

241
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,000
It's...

242
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,880
Yeah.

243
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,660
For...

244
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,740
Like it looks maxing.

245
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,240
Okay.

246
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,640
For those who don't know, it's basically the newest term that Gen Z has.

247
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,360
Has invented.

248
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,880
It's...

249
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,400
It's like...

250
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,800
You know how like the Sigma male with the cheekbones like that?

251
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:42,820
So apparently there's a new fad right now for Gen Z where they're like, we gotta like...

252
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,160
We gotta like...

253
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,700
Yeah.

254
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
We gotta have like the cheekbones.

255
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,980
And that's what they call it.

256
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,560
They call it like mewing.

257
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,380
I don't...

258
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,480
I don't know why it's called mewing.

259
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,380
I'm just being hip with the times, you know?

260
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm just relating to the children, to the kids.

261
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,560
Or is it Gen Alpha?

262
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,440
They sort of... oh, Gen... I like how the Gen Z people are like, we don't claim this, we're not that cringe.

263
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,680
And I'm like, oh you poor...

264
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,420
Gen Z...

265
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,680
You were already cringe.

266
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,900
You might as well own it.

267
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,320
Let's see, cheek angle.

268
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,260
Okay, we gotta put it here.

269
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,960
Oh my god, the fucking...

270
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,240
Okay, the chin.

271
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,200
Okay, let's see.

272
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,540
Alright, we gotta have small chin and then no chin.

273
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,180
Oh, maybe like thicken up the chin a little bit.

274
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,180
And then...

275
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,840
Okay.

276
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,980
Oh, yeah.

277
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,200
We can keep that here.

278
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,980
Oh, jawline.

279
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,080
Jawline.

280
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,640
I don't... okay, let's see.

281
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,120
Yes.

282
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,260
Oh my god.

283
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,900
Wait.

284
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
Wait, actually, maybe not as big.

285
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,280
Okay, and then...

286
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,100
Oh!

287
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,160

288
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,840

289
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,380

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,140

291
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,340
Oh my god.

292
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,800
You have the butt chin!

293
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,500

294
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,780
Okay, and then...

295
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,180
I think that's good.

296
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,680
Oh no, I want more of the butt showing popping out.

297
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
Oh my god the Peter Griffin.

298
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,300

299
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,120
Alright, jaw.

301
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,300
It's...

302
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,070
Guys!

303
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,830
We're actually getting there!

304
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:09,790
Okay.

305
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,170
I think... like here.

306
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,510
Alright, there we go.

307
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,790
Oh my god, wait, that's okay Thanos, you're right.

308
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,290
Okay, now, okay, we don't have to care, but honestly, like...

309
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,270
Eyebrows is like fine with me.

310
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,630
Unless... oh, I'm always like, huh?

311
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,330

And then... okay, we got dented a little bit more.

313
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,970
Eyebrow foot... eyebrow tail?

314
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,510
Oh, this part.

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,150
Okay, yeah, I don't... I'm not...

316
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,110
The biggest eyes possible!

317
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,850
Actually, the smallest eyes possible.

318
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,630
Actually, never mind.

319
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,330
This is a lot better.

320
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,470
I actually like that a lot.

321
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,070
I'm...

322
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,190
Alright.

323
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,890
Ooh, big nostrils.

324
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,470
I want huge nostrils so I can smell them better.

325
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,650
Nostril...

326
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,510
Okay, I want to be able to smell better.

327
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,810
So I can smell my enemies.

328
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,590
Nose...

329
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,310
Oh wait, can I extend the neck?

330
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,470
No, I can't.

331
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,310
Alright.

332
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,050
What do you see with your tiny eyes?

333
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,730
What do you...

334
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,270
What do you see with your tiny eyes?

335
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,890
Okay, wait, I should...

336
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,730
Wait, I like that.

337
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:47,330
Okay.

338
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,830
Wait, I...

339
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,250
Okay, I actually think the...

340
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,370
The pigtails... the...

341
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,730
Looks so good.

342
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,210
It looks... Okay, wait.

343
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,770
Let me double check.

344
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,870
I think the pigtails is actually perfect for this.

345
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,230
I think it's...

346
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,610
It's actually really, really good.

347
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,090
Okay, let me double check.

348
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:19,110
Let me make sure if the pigtails is what I want in the end.

349
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,820
All I'm saying is that I think the pigtails...

350
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,270
I think the pigtails is perfect for this.

351
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,490
Um...

352
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,510
It does hide the dents though.

353
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,130
The gamer dents a lot.

354
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,390
So it's like I worked really hard for that.

355
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,410
But like it's okay.

356
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,470
It's alright.

357
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,590
I think it's actually really good.

358
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,030
I think it's really good.

359
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,060
Okay.

360
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,580
Um...

361
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,340
Alright.

362
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,680
Okay, body.

363
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,820
Short so...

364
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
Alright, so we have like...

365
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,800
Uh...

366
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,440
This... Oh... Okay.

367
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,020
We gotta be like a little hobbit if possible.

368
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,780
The smaller...

369
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:04,880
Oh!

370
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,740
Nice.

371
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,860
Okay.

372
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,940
Maybe like...

373
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,060
Yeah, there we go.

374
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,680
There we... Oh.

375
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,860
Small hitbox!

376
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,600
Small head!

377
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,300
Okay.

378
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,820
Smaller head, smaller head hitbox.

379
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,020
Alright, waist.

380
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,520
I think we don't have to care about that.

381
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,280
I'm pretty sure.

382
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,500
Wait, chest size.

383
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,380
Oh!

384
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,120
Okay.

385
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,380
Ha!

386
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,270
Okay.

387
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,270
Wait, what does it look like?

388
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,630
Oh my God!

389
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,110
Like the upper body!

390
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,270
Holy shit!

391
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,270
The only hitbox!

392
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,770
That...

393
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:47,910
Okay.

394
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,510
Um...

395
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,550
Alright.

396
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,330
Let's see.

397
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,590
Arms and...

398
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,250
Okay, what about like if I make like everything else like super...

399
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,590
Alright.

400
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,670
Alright, there you go.

401
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,530
Ooh, okay.

402
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,070
Yeah, the tall waist length.

403
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,430
And then... arms and legs.

404
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,770
Oh, wait, where's the legs?

405
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,050
There we go.

406
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,890
Holy shit, what did I create there?

407
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,590
No, it should be like... this is like the only boosted part of it.

408
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,610
Of everything.

409
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,830
The body should not be able to hold this.

410
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,810
Okay, there we go.

411
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,050
Alright, nice.

412
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,350
That's actually good.

413
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:41,710
That's good.

414
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,110
That's good.

415
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,010
I think we're looking good.

416
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,410
We're looking good here.

417
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,510
Body paint.

418
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,750
Okay, no.

419
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,350
No, absolutely not.

420
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,370
We're not having body...

421
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,030
We're not having a random fucking hand there.

422
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,090
Like, what?

423
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,950
Why is there a hand on there?

424
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,870
Alright.

425
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:00,750
Alright.

426
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,350
Uhhh...

427
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,410
I think we're good.

428
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,970
I think we're really...

429
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,690
I think we're looking really good, guys.

430
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:09,970
Alright, name character.

431
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:11,790
Uhhh...

432
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,330
Oh, wait, is this like staring?

433
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,790
Hair tied?

434
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,230
Oh, wait, what?

435
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,370
Oh, hair tied, hair down.

436
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,250
Wait, what?

437
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,030
Why is this hair down?

438
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,630
Staring, look around?

439
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,690
What does that mean?

440
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,710
Alright.

441
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,270
Okay, let's see.

442
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:31,790
Name character.

443
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,050
Yes.

444
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,490
This is gonna be my character.

445
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,110
Alright.

446
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,310
You will be named...

447
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,390
Your name will be...

448
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,650
Peak Dragoon.

449
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,030
Okay.

450
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,050
Okay.

451
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,190
Okay.

452
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,570
Okay.

453
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:49,830
Okay.

454
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,930
Okay.

455
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,470
Okay.

456
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,830
Okay.

457
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,010
That's...

458
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,890
That's you guys, Dragoons!

459
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,870
We don't claim her.

460
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,910
Alright.

461
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,130
Okay, how about this?

462
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,990
Alright, instead of that, alright.

463
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,730
We will do...

464
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,550
Um...

465
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,150
Once a Dragoon.

466
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,290
Once a Dragoon.

467
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,150
Once a Dragoon.

468
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:27,810
Alright.

469
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,310
There we go.

470
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,050
That's gonna be your name.

471
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,210
Once Dragoon.

472
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,070
Uh...

473
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,910
Alright.

474
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,850
Enter game.

475
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,690
What do you see?

476
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,110
That's us!

477
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,830
You guys are goon maxing.

478
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,650
Dagger still stuck in the sheath.

479
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,150
Inspection 481 complete.

480
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,930
I wonder what Tenjin made.

481
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,130
Whoa!

482
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,450
We have magic powers!

483
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,850
What the fuck are we doing?

484
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,570
Dragoon, what are you guys doing?

485
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,130
Huh?

486
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,230
Why are shoulders so wide?

487
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,690
It has to carry the assets!

488
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,230
What do you mean?

489
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,350
How else do you carry those assets?

490
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:51,980
Oh.

491
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,930
What the fuck?

492
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,690
What's that in you guys?

493
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,650
What?

494
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,430
Okay, remember.

495
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,710
I'm gonna move.

496
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,030
Wait, I haven't...

497
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,270
Oh!

498
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:11,930
Oh, it stopped!

499
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,150
Okay.

500
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,610
I'm sorry.

501
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:25,470
The legs definitely do not match the rest of the body.

502
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,870
Use deactivate it.

503
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,210
You're so beautiful, guys.

504
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,950
I'm not coping!

505
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,050
This is you guys!

506
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,170
Not me!

507
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,930
I'm not...

508
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,630
Okay, I'm sorry.

509
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,150
Your body...

510
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,150
Okay.

511
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:47,990
Okay.

512
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,190
All right.

513
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,030
Let's grab the...

514
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,490
Let's clean you all real fast.

515
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,790
All right.

516
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,010
What is this?

517
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,750
No.

518
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,990
It is an adult human.

519
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:57,530
Okay.

520
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,910
All right.

521
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,050
We don't care about these guys.

522
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,830
I finished the tutorial.

523
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,190
This is...

524
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,350
All right.

525
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,490
So, access code for chrono cage.

526
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,790
Update the code after completing today's experiment.

527
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,230
Okay.

528
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,050
This is the code.

529
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,330
Uh...

530
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,710
You guys are...

531
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,510
Dorito...

532
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,730
Yeah.

533
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,890
You guys are.

534
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,150
All right.

535
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,450
You won't last long if consumed food and drink to increase your energy and hydration.

536
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,650
Oh, no.

537
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,810
Is this a survival?

538
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,730
Open your backpack to check your inventory.

539
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,550
Okay.

540
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,430
Uh...

541
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,170
Most of the ingredients and details are in the bag.

542
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,830
Dishes have a durability which gradually decays over time.

543
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,730
Once the durability reaches zero, the food...

544
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,530
Oh, okay.

545
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,590
This is a little fast.

546
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,350
This is a little fast for me.

547
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,010
Okay, we gotta eat.

548
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,630
And then we gotta drink.

549
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,510
Alright.

550
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,510
Okay, I'm fully hydrated now.

551
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,110
Okay.

552
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,850
Is there anybody in here?

553
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,530
No, it's just me.

554
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,290
Okay, mouse4 is melee.

555
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,070
Okay, melee, roar...

556
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,530
Oh, and then there's flashlights.

557
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,230
World unlocks when the Eye of Evolution is completed?

558
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,090
Alright, what's this?

559
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,150
Input password.

560
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,750
Oh shit!

561
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,690
I read it but I didn't read it.

562
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,890
Give me a sec.

563
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,030
Let me read the memo again.

564
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,990
Okay.

565
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,910
Uh...

566
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,290
Is it 0728?

567
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,790
Okay, 0728.

568
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,050
I got it.

569
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,990
0728.

570
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,430
0728.

571
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,610
Yay!

572
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,050
I can read!

573
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,730
Yippee!

574
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,210
Oh hey, there's a dead guy.

575
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,130
Hello?

576
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,410
Wait, did I kill him too?

577
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,930
An intact critter was recovered?

578
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,350
With those used.

579
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,530
Any store within the Cradle shows unused signs of activity.

580
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,750
Uh...

581
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,770
Has been placed in a separate room for safekeeping.

582
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,610
Am I the Cradle?

583
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,870
Where's this the Cradle?

584
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,610
Find the access...

585
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,330
No, okay, no.

586
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,290
We have to find the access card.

587
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,370
Okay.

588
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,830
Who killed these guys?

589
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,670
Did I kill them?

590
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,790
Did I kill these people?

591
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,990
Will me?

592
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,650
But I'm so innocent.

593
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,630
Look at me.

594
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,930
Wait, is there...

595
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,950
I'm just wondering if there's certain, like, physics.

596
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,660
No.

597
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,100
Okay.

598
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,120
I was just curious.

599
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,780
Oh shit!

600
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,060
Okay.

601
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,640
Oops.

602
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,740
Sorry.

603
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,580
Did I break my leg?

604
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,400
Wait, you can break your leg?

605
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,160
It's okay, I'm fine.

606
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,300
My shins are like a little bit rickety.

607
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,740
My shins are just a little rickety right now.

608
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,540
Oh, what's this?

609
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,580
Med kit.

610
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,940
Okay, we gotta get all the meds.

611
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,560
Uh...

612
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,300
Item crate.

613
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,700
Food.

614
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,720
Boiled water.

615
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,460
Just water?

616
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,420
Where's like the tea or soda?

617
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,600
Deviation of unknown level detected in the research area.

618
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,460
Deviation appears to consist of multiple floating butterflies.

619
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,980
Floating butterflies?

620
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,640
I don't know what that means.

621
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:30,740
I don't know what that means.

622
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,080
There's like floating butterflies in everything.

623
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,800
Oh!

624
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,740
What's that?

625
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,140
How's the game sound so far?

626
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,700
I don't know where to go.

627
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,520
How can I already be lost?

628
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,520
There's like nothing here.

629
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,320
Like...

630
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,840
Okay.

631
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,100
Uh...

632
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,700
What's that sound?

633
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,080
Um...

634
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,040
Do I have to go downstairs?

635
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,240
I don't know.

636
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,920
Find the access card.

637
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,980
Where is the access card?

638
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,080
Go to the waypoint.

639
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
Did I get the access card already?

640
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,180
Oh no!

641
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,880
My foot!

642
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,480
It's okay.

643
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,700
Just a little...

644
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,720
It's okay.

645
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,640
I just twisted my ankle a little bit.

646
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,020
How can I like the peak human being?

647
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,900
If I get like a twisted ankle?

648
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,680
I don't know.

649
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:32,740
I don't know.

650
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,360
There's fall damage?

651
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,840
This is bullshit.

652
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,520
Why is there fall damage in my video game?

653
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,080
Okay.

654
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,120
I'm

655
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,240
once human!

656
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,540
I should not have fall damage.

657
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,540
Wait, that's also me.

658
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,760
Oh my god.

659
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,680
Is this like Death Stranding?

660
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,080
Where I have a baby in the backpack?

661
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,550
Oh!

662
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,090
Crow?

663
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,910
What's this crow doing here?

664
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,510
Crow.

665
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,070
Talk to the strange bird.

666
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,410
Who are you?

667
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,850
I'm a metahuman?

668
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,080
What do you call...

669
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,500
You know, what do you call me?

670
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,260
A metahuman?

671
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,040
Why am I?

672
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,760
You don't remember.

673
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,520
Do you remember who you are?

674
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,020
Hello?

675
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,340
You already finished the tutorial?

676
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm...

677
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,640
I'm making my base.

678
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,580
You're what?

679
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,060
I'm making my base.

680
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,260
You're what?

681
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm making...

682
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,460
I just met the bird.

683
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,700
I just met the bird.

684
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,700
You just met the bird.

685
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,220
I'm making a base.

686
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,840
What?

687
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,300
There's a beast?

688
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Spoiler alert!

689
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:19,700
I'm making a base.

690
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,360
Don't worry about it.

691
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,360
I'm making it.

692
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,400
How far am I?

693
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,320
How far am I from the beast?

694
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,260
From the crow to the beast?

695
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,360
Um...

696
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,960
Not that far actually.

697
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,020
Oh, not that far.

698
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,740
Okay, okay.

699
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,160
That's good.

700
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,580
Okay.

701
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,400
I'll catch you on the other side soon.

702
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,140
Don't worry.

703
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,800
I'll be making some base.

704
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,380
Trust me.

705
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,600
Okay.

706
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,200
Once you got here, I will have a home.

707
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,740
You'll have a home?

708
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,340
I am not homeless.

709
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,100
I won't be homeless.

710
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,760
There's a base?

711
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,960
I thought this was...

712
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,660
I got game instances and thought it was just like an extraction shooter or something.

713
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,600
That's your bot?

714
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,440
I don't know.

715
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,700
I'm... I'm...

716
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,960
There's a home building?

717
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,280
Yeah, I'm making a base.

718
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,000
I was laughing the whole time.

719
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,340
Oh, I thought you said beast.

720
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,840
I thought you said like...

721
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,780
There's like a fucking companion.

722
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,780
No, I'm making a base.

723
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,280
Oh my god.

724
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,540
Okay, at least...

725
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,340
I'm gonna mooch off your house then.

726
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,180
Oh yeah, sure.

727
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,520
I'll just find where you live.

728
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:26,780
Alright.

729
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,560
I'll be there soon.

730
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,620
I'll be right back.

731
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,880
I'm still talking to the crow.

732
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,260
Okay, okay.

733
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,420
Oh my god.

734
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,720
He already has a house?

735
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,000
Wait, what happened?

736
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,580
I already forgot what he talked to me about.

737
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,200
It trapped me in the cradle.

738
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,740
It could have robbed you of your memories.

739
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,950
Oh, we used to be best friends!

740
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,830
Me and the crow.

741
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,810
You can call me V.

742
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,670
It seems that our interests are aligned, MetaHuman.

743
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,390
It seems that our interests are aligned, MetaHuman.

744
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,190
Wait, but you're a talking bird.

745
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,590
Wait, but you're a talking bird.

746
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,730
What are you talking about?

747
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,950
You're a talking bird.

748
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,010
I used to be like you once.

749
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,210
A MetaHuman.

750
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,730
When we die, we become crows?

751
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,750
But it's a long story.

752
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,710
And now is not the time.

753
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,350
No, I have lots of time!

754
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,170
What do you mean?

755
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,130
Just tell me now!

756
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:25,630
Alright.

757
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,490
I came to secure a deviation.

758
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,190
A paper butterfly.

759
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,050
But I think something must have scared it.

760
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,090
Deviation?

761
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,630
Right now, though, we need to move.

762
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,810
There's so much lore for a game that might die in a month.

763
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,770
But only if you help me complete my mission first.

764
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:44,650
Alright.

765
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:45,810
Alright.

766
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,910
All you have to do is listen to what I tell you.

767
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,870
Okay.

768
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,190
I'll be right here in the cradle.

769
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,010
Now, let's go.

770
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,530
Alright, here we go.

771
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,390
Whoa!

772
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,450
Oh, this is the cradle!

773
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:01,910
Okay.

774
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,590
Uhh...

775
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,330
We have to explore this press Q to use space time to search for items.

776
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,510
Oh my god!

777
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,730
You just snapped your fingers!

778
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,650
Hahaha!

779
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,330
Hahaha!

780
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,870
I have a machete now.

781
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,910
Oh my god!

782
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:20,830
Just snap your fingers!

783
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,470
Wait, what the fuck?

784
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,670
What the fuck is that?

785
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,950
What the fuck is that?

786
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,610
What the fuck is that?

787
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,470
Deviant has water?

788
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,550
Oh, so that's what the humans turn into.

789
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,670
Okay, give me that gear.

790
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,150
Oh my god, I get a hat!

791
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,530
Oh my god!

792
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,370
Nice hat!

793
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,450
Hahaha!

794
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,210
Same hat!

795
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:05,990
Snap.

796
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,430
Snap.

797
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,890
Oh, there's stuff here.

798
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,090
Wait, there's actual stuff here.

799
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,710
I'll just go in here.

800
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,570
I'm just snapping for fun.

801
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,130
Wait, where the fuck did you come from?

802
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,610
Holy shit!

803
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,770
Get out of here!

804
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,490
This is a tutorial!

805
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,970
Alright, let's see.

806
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,170
What's in here?

807
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,950
Oh, a Molotov.

808
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,450
Snap.

809
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,330
Snap.

810
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,190
Okay, the snapping is a little addicting.

811
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:31,730
Hahaha!

812
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,510
Whoa!

813
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,790
Okay, there he is.

814
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,530
Ha!

815
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,410
That's fucking right!

816
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,450
You're in the wrong neighborhood!

817
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,190
Okay, let's grab this real fast.

818
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,210
Uh...

819
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,490
Oh!

820
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,690
I got shoes now!

821
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,130
Guys!

822
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,130
I got shoes!

823
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,530
After image?

824
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,830
Woman.

825
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,060
Oh?

826
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,540
Where did...

827
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,140
Where did female take me?

828
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,940
Oh, okay.

829
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,900
Let me raise up the volume a little.

830
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,980
Oh my god.

831
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,840
What the fuck?

832
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
What are all these?

833
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,280
Where are these extra...

834
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,900
Wait, self-destruct?

835
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,780
What are these extra settings?

836
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,960
Alright.

837
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,660
Let's see.

838
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,560
I'll turn down the sound effects.

839
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,040
And then I'll turn up the game.

840
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:31,660
Okay.

841
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,100
Let's see.

842
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,260
Yeah, alright.

843
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,080
Game has been turned up.

844
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,220
Hahaha!

845
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,700
Oh.

846
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,660
Spiritual often cause anomalies in time.

847
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,840
A loud pass seems to be witnessed once again.

848
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,920
Activate space-time to locate...

849
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,080
Spatial Theors.

850
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,220
Where events and people from the past may reappear and potentially reveal a hidden truth.

851
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,380
Reappear and potentially reveal a hidden truth.

852
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,220
Snap!

853
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,660
Snap!

854
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,360
Whoa!

855
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,200
Is this me?

856
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,080
Oh no.

857
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,140
This is the girl we had to find.

858
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,820
Yes, you killed her.

859
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,400
Yeah, that's right.

860
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,100
It is your fault.

861
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,640
Try and stay calm.

862
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,460
Yeah, you killed them all and you're gonna live with that guilt forever.

863
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,140
Oh shit, I'm a bit thirsty.

864
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,460
Oh shit, I'm a bit thirsty.

865
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,940
Not because of women.

866
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,360
It would be better for everyone if I just...

867
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,880
Just what?

868
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,520
Leave me alone.

869
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,040
Please.

870
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,500
Don't waste your time.

871
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,580
No, but this is the military.

872
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,640
We have to use you.

873
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,680
And you're not a monster.

874
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,920
In fact, you're very, very special.

875
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,280
That's right.

876
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,060
You need to learn how to control your power.

877
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,320
Once you do that, you can help fix this broken world.

878
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,600
Once you do that, you can help fix this broken world.

879
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,480
We can do that together.

880
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,620
Yay!

881
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,680
Okay, we gotta drink water.

882
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,280
I can summon V?

883
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,140
Hey there!

884
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,000
Leave.

885
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,860
Okay, goodbye.

886
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,320
Never mind!

887
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,660
I thought he would want to talk to me.

888
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:13,980
I thought he would want to talk to me.

889
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,740
I guess not.

890
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,820
Okay.

891
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,900
Let's see.

892
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:19,860
Snap!

893
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,670
Oh, that's a butterfly!

894
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,810
Oh, you can create butterflies?

895
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,110
That seems pretty useless.

896
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,630
Hey, I know like...

897
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,830
Tengen is waiting for me, but I'm gonna loot a bit.

898
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,870
I know he's like waiting for me after finishing the tutorial.

899
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,050
I don't know, maybe a couple minutes ago.

900
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,470
I'm still in the beginning.

901
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,490
But like, this is more important.

902
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,550
Whoa, she can fly!

903
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,530
And I think I finally found it.

904
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:09,770
You.

905
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,390
Hey, we can secure other new missions.

906
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:11,890
You're special!

907
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,910
We can use them to forge a new path.

908
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,970
And bring about true evolution.

909
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,830
This will be the Mayfly's mission.

910
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:19,250
I'm gonna go to the other side.

911
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,430
This is why we'll fight.

912
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,470
Mayflies?

913
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,310
That's right.

914
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,430
Mayflies.

915
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,570
Small, yet invincible.

916
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,910
Humanity may seem puny now.

917
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,090
But we'll prove we can endure.

918
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,090
Oh!

919
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,550
Okay, let's loot this crate.

920
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,630
There's so much lore.

921
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,770
Wait, where do I go from here?

922
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,550
Snap!

923
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,230
Did I loot all this?

924
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,190
No, I did.

925
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,030
Snap!

926
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,670
Where's the door?

927
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,470
Oh, there's the door!

928
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:48,890
Okay.

929
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:49,750
Snap.

930
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,990
Oh, shit!

931
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,610
Get over here.

932
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,570
Oh my god!

933
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,570
What the fuck?

934
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,070
Okay, the monster designs are pretty interesting.

935
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,410
Like, I would admit.

936
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,270
Alright.

937
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,670
Nice!

938
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,410
Now I have gloves!

939
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,150
Where do I get down from here?

940
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,290
Am I gonna break my legs again?

941
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,350
Is there like an easier way to get down?

942
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,370
I'm gonna break my legs.

943
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:14,770
Okay.

944
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,490
This guy right here.

945
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,650
Oh shit!

946
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:19,510
Okay.

947
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,210
Legs slightly injured.

948
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:21,710
It's okay.

949
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,710
I can get better.

950
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,190
Alright.

951
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,530
Not really a huge threat yet.

952
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,930
To be fair.

953
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,430
Like, I feel like I'm faster than them.

954
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,650
It's the hitbox.

955
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:37,810
Oh!

956
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,490
I can throw?

957
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,630
Oh shit!

958
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,090
Wait, what?

959
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,530
What the fuck?

960
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,730
Okay, approach and attempt to capture it.

961
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,150
Oh shit.

962
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,230
Uh, how do I throw this thing?

963
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,370
How do I throw this away?

964
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,330
How do I?

965
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,830
Oh, discard!

966
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,030
Okay.

967
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,090
Wait, that's so cool!

968
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,910
I can have like, I can use their like heads to fight for me.

969
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,350
What's this?

970
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,000
Wait.

971
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,520
Touch.

972
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,500
Wait, but what about my- No!

973
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,780
My gun!

974
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,940
Whoa!

975
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,080
I love it when my cutscenes are five five.

976
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,800
Frames per second.

977
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:22,960
Hahaha!

978
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,240
Hahaha!

979
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:25,920
Hahaha!

980
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,210
Wait, that's it?

981
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,250
Wait, I'm- Wait, no!

982
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:47,690
My gun!

983
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,490
Wait, I'm at like- You have left Victor's territory.

984
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,370
Wait, I'm at a house now!

985
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,670
What is this?

986
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,210
Like, The original Fortnite?

987
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,890
Like, what?

988
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,470
Whose house is this?

989
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,650
Wait, there's like- What is- Wait, what?

990
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,090
Is this like a horde?

991
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,170
Is there gonna be a horde mode?

992
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,370
Is this seven days to die?

993
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,070
Like...

994
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,930
Oh, hello.

995
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,410
Isolated securement unit.

996
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,990
Oh, no.

997
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:24,910
No, it's mine.

998
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,250
I'm not giving you it.

999
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,290
I'm not gonna give you this.

1000
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:34,710
Yeah!

1001
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,590
This is a meta.

1002
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,110
Only just woken up.

1003
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,010
They were kind enough to activate the cradle.

1004
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,090
Oh, my gosh.

1005
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:45,910
I still don't have pants.

1006
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,530
So weird.

1007
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,830
Shoes, gloves and...

1008
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,610
Shoes, gloves and hat, but no pants.

1009
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,190
Still...

1010
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,770
Thank you, Meta-Human.

1011
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,730
Your help means a lot to me.

1012
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,890
You can call me Mitsuko.

1013
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,290
I used to be a Meta-human as well.

1014
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,610
Rosetta did all kinds of experiments on me.

1015
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,950
Wait, used to?

1016
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,490
Until V saved me.

1017
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,450
What happened after?

1018
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,370
You still look... You're not Qrow yet.

1019
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,870
Wait.

1020
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,990
Are we all Rosetta's experiments?

1021
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,780
You still look like a human.

1022
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,620
Sengen, you're covering...

1023
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,480
No, Sengen covered it up for you guys.

1024
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,600
The mayflies?

1025
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:13,760
What?

1026
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,740
What the fuck is going on?

1027
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,480
Oh, these are the...

1028
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,580
The ones that we had to kill.

1029
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:42,860
Okay.

1030
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,900
Yeah, this is like Lord Dumping time.

1031
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,620
Okay.

1032
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,220
So we have to give them the butterfly.

1033
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,080
I worked so hard!

1034
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,420
Alright.

1035
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,620
Butterfly time.

1036
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,760
Alright.

1037
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,100
Deviant power.

1038
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,080
Owner.

1039
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,740
That's us!

1040
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,920
Once Dragoon!

1041
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,600
Deviant power.

1042
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,460
Owner.

1043
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,540
That's us!

1044
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,200
Once Dragoon!

1045
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:42,820
Get the mayflies.

1046
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,620
We make cradles and securement units to keep deviations contained.

1047
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,020
We're finding ways for humans and deviations to live in harmony.

1048
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,620
This is our best chance of cleaning up Rosetta's mess.

1049
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,900
So what exactly are deviations?

1050
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,960
No one's exactly sure what they are.

1051
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,240
Just that they're not bound by the physical laws of our world.

1052
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,180
They came from another dimension.

1053
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,900
Don't worry, gamer.

1054
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,960
If our game survives another month, we'll tell you what they actually are.

1055
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,540
They're just stardust.

1056
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,840
We can put this entire world and Rift space closer together.

1057
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,200
Sometimes it becomes possible to pass between the two planes of existence.

1058
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,980
And when that happens, all hell breaks loose.

1059
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,680
We believe that's what caused Starfall.

1060
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,220
So what exactly are you trying to do?

1061
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,120
Some deviations are friendly, like the butterfly.

1062
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:36,300
But others, like the ones inside Monoliths, are extremely dangerous.

1063
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,860
It's not practical to secure all of them.

1064
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,820
But if we can learn more about them...

1065
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,200
Maybe we can find ways to live alongside them.

1066
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,440
That's the goal.

1067
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,040
You must be prepared.

1068
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,120
The stardust just keeps spreading.

1069
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,940
And we aren't sure why.

1070
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,240
Oh, they're coming!

1071
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,740
We're here for the butterflies!

1072
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,220
Horde mode time!

1073
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,900
Be careful.

1074
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,920
That must be a siren.

1075
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,660
A siren?

1076
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,040
They must have gotten through.

1077
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:04,880
Come on, Meta.

1078
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,860
A deviation from another world just entered this space.

1079
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,800
And it won't go down without a fight.

1080
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,800
Take the butterfly with you.

1081
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,140
It can help.

1082
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh, God.

1083
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:14,580
Okay.

1084
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,980
I'm gonna take it.

1085
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,800
How do I do this?

1086
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,440
Uhhhh...

1087
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,020
Withdraw.

1088
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,820
Alright, it's in my pocket now.

1089
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,420
Alright, no more weapons.

1090
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,240
Ooh!

1091
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,980
Okay, now we have a jacket.

1092
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:26,880
Armor.

1093
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,140
We have armor now.

1094
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,980
Where is it?

1095
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,460
Where the fuck... Where's my armor?

1096
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,220
Is it this?

1097
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,420
Oh, there we go.

1098
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,500
Alright, we put our armor on.

1099
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,260
I know, I know, guys.

1100
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,040
We're gonna put...

1101
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,960
I know, I know.

1102
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,720
You might not want... Oh my God.

1103
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,900
Jesus Christ.

1104
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,580
We still have no pants?

1105
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,200
Okay.

1106
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,040
Alright.

1107
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,060
Don't need no armor.

1108
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,620
Alright, is this pants?

1109
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,720
Am I finally gonna get pants here?

1110
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,860
Is this it?

1111
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,600
Oh no, it's fabric.

1112
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,400
Apparently not.

1113
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,940
It's still not pants time, apparently.

1114
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,440
Oh shit.

1115
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:09,980
Somebody...

1116
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,520
Somebody's diary.

1117
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,520
Who cares?

1118
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,820
Alright, let's see.

1119
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,940
Are there any pants here?

1120
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,460
I'm just wondering if there's any pants at all.

1121
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,920
Oh, there's med kit though.

1122
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,280
Uhhhh... Alright.

1123
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,000
I already took the thing.

1124
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,660
Uhhh... Synchroize... Synchroize... Attach wire.

1125
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,520
Building features locked.

1126
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,880
Wait, what?

1127
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,680
I took the butterfly.

1128
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,100
Uhhhh...

1129
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,380
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

1130
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,440
Interact... Unit to view details.

1131
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,600
Oh, I have to view it!

1132
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,820
How do I view... Oh, okay.

1133
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,900
Base stat, it's auto attack.

1134
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,860
Synchroize the cradle.

1135
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,260
Combat deviations are a special type of deviation.

1136
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,320
While aggressive, it will take instructions.

1137
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,300
Uh, different... Oh!

1138
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,880
The dormancy threshold of a combat deviation cannot be adjusted and defaults to 100.

1139
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,420
After synching, you can summon it to attack.

1140
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,400
Oh, the butterflies will fight for me!

1141
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,260
Oh, I see.

1142
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,040
Okay.

1143
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,880
Uhhh...

1144
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,740
Target attack...

1145
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,180
Oh!

1146
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,260
So they're like dangerous... They're like dangerous butterflies.

1147
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,120
Okay, use green light and mood recovery speed increases.

1148
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:28,660
Okay.

1149
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:29,980
Alright.

1150
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,020
Oh, what?

1151
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,280
Oh!

1152
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,260
Oh, this is what tension means when...

1153
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:37,800
Hahaha!

1154
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,700
Alright, guys.

1155
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,720
It's Minecraft time!

1156
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,320
It's Minecraft!

1157
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,940
It's Minecraft!

1158
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:52,890
Guys, it's time for Minecraft.

1159
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,910
We gotta cut the trees.

1160
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,030
Because we have to cut...

1161
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:01,570
Equip the gathering tool before you start.

1162
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,970
It's much faster than doing it all bare hand.

1163
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:08,230
You can craft gathering tools at your campsites or supplies work.

1164
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:10,990
Okay, this is a lot different from what I saw on the trailers.

1165
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,330
I'm just gonna say.

1166
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:12,870
This is...

1167
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:13,470
Hahaha!

1168
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,030
The more it's fast, the more...

1169
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:22,610
This is not what I expected from the trailers.

1170
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:23,850
Not gonna lie.

1171
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,010
Or...

1172
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,110
Or...

1173
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,090
Or...

1174
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:27,290
Or time!

1175
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,550
Hahaha!

1176
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:29,070
Hahaha!

1177
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,950
I think I'm playing Ark right now.

1178
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:36,110
Guys, we tricked ourselves into playing Ark again.

1179
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,270
Hahaha!

1180
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,070
Hahaha!

1181
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:38,550
Hahaha!

1182
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:40,670
Well, we can't get scammed.

1183
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:41,630
If it's free.

1184
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,510
And we...

1185
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,270
This is a free game.

1186
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,210
Free Ark, guys!

1187
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,310
Free Ark!

1188
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:48,830
Alright.

1189
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,870
We gotta cut some trees.

1190
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:53,850
And we always come back to Minecraft.

1191
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,450
This is free to play Ark, guys.

1192
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,790
Free to play Ark.

1193
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,090
It's in the description.

1194
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,530
You guys know I don't read.

1195
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,870
I just watch videos.

1196
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:09,130
The videos I saw of Once Human was like people shooting monsters.

1197
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,650
That's like what I saw.

1198
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,950
So I was not expecting this.

1199
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,290
I saw like...

1200
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,490
I guess they like skipped the building part of this game.

1201
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,470
So I never noticed.

1202
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:19,150
Hahaha!

1203
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:24,510
Alright.

1204
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,170
Alright, let's see.

1205
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,590
We need more ores.

1206
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:29,150
Oh my god.

1207
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:30,630
There's so many ores around us.

1208
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:31,790
Alright.

1209
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:32,510
Don't worry.

1210
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:33,070
We're almost there.

1211
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,030
Now I know what he's been farming.

1212
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,790
Now I know.

1213
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:38,450
Alright.

1214
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,070
Here you go.

1215
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:41,870
Let's see.

1216
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:42,850
We're almost there.

1217
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,710
Yay!

1218
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,910
I just set up a campsite?!

1219
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,610
Okay, I'm gonna live next to her.

1220
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:51,310
Alright.

1221
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,950
Craft a bear hands and a campsite to craft basic gear, tools, and dishes.

1222
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:57,950
These will help you survive better in the wilderness.

1223
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:02,650
Guys, I don't remember which is the stage where I get to actually interact with real people.

1224
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:04,770
Craft with bear hands?

1225
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,270
Okay.

1226
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:11,550
Uh, items including gathering tool and... wait, do I not have pickaxe already?

1227
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:13,570
Okay, yeah.

1228
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:15,310
Shouldn't I have a pickaxe?

1229
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:15,890
Oh, what?

1230
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:17,730
Alright.

1231
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,650
Toggle between the tables.

1232
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:21,110
Ooh!

1233
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,310
Okay, crossbow... pants!

1234
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,130
Alright guys, just for you guys, I won't craft pants.

1235
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,650
Uh, do I have a... I have a crossbow ready, right?

1236
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:33,810
Okay, I don't think I do.

1237
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:35,250
I mean, do I?

1238
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,210
That's... that's gun.

1239
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:37,530
That's sort of like gun.

1240
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:38,530
Uh...

1241
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:40,050
Alright.

1242
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,710
Oh, I need to create arrows.

1243
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,530
Uh... there you go.

1244
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,050
I don't think I need like more than five.

1245
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:55,750
Alright, nice.

1246
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,950
Open survival to view survive... crackdown attacking deviants.

1247
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,150
Are they coming over now?

1248
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,710
You're a bit thirsty.

1249
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,470
Okay, let me...

1250
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:08,250
Collect water.

1251
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,430
Alright, collecting the water.

1252
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,890
Oh, there's a butterfly!

1253
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,290
Do you see it?

1254
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,930
So like, instead of a child, there's a butterfly in my backpack.

1255
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,390
Alright, let's see.

1256
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,590
Uh... I want to...

1257
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:29,710
I wanna...

1258
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,770
Wait, how do I boil water?

1259
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:32,190
Oh, there you go.

1260
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:32,750
Boil water.

1261
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:34,090
Nice.

1262
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:35,870
Yay!

1263
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,470
And then I gotta drink my water.

1264
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:40,810
Oh my gosh, I have so much water.

1265
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:42,950
Stay hydrated, guys.

1266
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,510
Uh, I'm not hungry yet, so we're fine.

1267
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,690
Um, yeah, this is like the original Fortnite.

1268
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,910
Alright, I'm ready.

1269
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:53,770
Fight.

1270
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,240
What was that?

1271
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,780
Is this like...

1272
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,000
Plants vs.

1273
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,960
Zombies 2?

1274
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,260
Oh my god, it's like Plants vs.

1275
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:14,940
Zombies!

1276
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,860
They're here to attack my butterflies!

1277
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,870
It's everything I've ever wanted!

1278
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,370
RTX on Plants vs.

1279
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:34,010
Zombies!

1280
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,090
It does look like Siren Head, yeah.

1281
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,990
Oh shit, what the fuck?

1282
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,290
That is a lot bigger than I expected.

1283
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:45,370
Oh no.

1284
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,730
Oh no, we're...

1285
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,250
Oh no, how do I use it?

1286
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:49,690
How do I use it?

1287
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:51,790
Okay, weapon crate.

1288
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,330
Open the weapon!

1289
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,230
He's coming over!

1290
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,670
Uh...

1291
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:57,970
Uh...

1292
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,410
Where's my arrow?

1293
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,930
You have entered...

1294
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:01,550
What do you mean?

1295
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:02,250
What do you mean?

1296
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,010
Why can't I... Do I not have equipped?

1297
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:05,710
Okay, uh...

1298
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,170
Click on... Oh no, that's not what I wanted!

1299
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:08,670
No!

1300
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:10,810
No, I don't want that!

1301
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,330
Okay, uh...

1302
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,270
Alright, equipped.

1303
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:14,550
Arrow.

1304
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,730
Oh, I hope this pauses the game.

1305
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:18,410
Hahaha!

1306
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:20,790
Okay.

1307
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,490
170 HP.

1308
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,970
Does he have a head?

1309
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:28,010
Am I headshotting?

1310
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:29,770
Am I...

1311
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,230
Oh my god.

1312
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,170
Auto attack.

1313
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,150
Do your thing.

1314
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:40,690
Okay.

1315
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,250
Oh shit, the turrets are automatic!

1316
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:45,050
Oh, what the fuck?

1317
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,350
My butterflies are so strong!

1318
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,330
Bro, why am I wasting my arrows?

1319
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,130
Hahaha!

1320
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:50,990
Wait...

1321
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,010
I'm just gonna wait.

1322
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:52,690
Hahaha!

1323
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,980
It's just standing there, menacingly.

1324
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,780
Hahaha!

1325
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,360
It's so strong, guys!

1326
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,200
What was that?

1327
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,640
Festering gel?

1328
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,920
What did I secure?

1329
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,140
The deviation escape?

1330
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:14,820
No!

1331
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,780
Alright, let's see.

1332
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,480
That was easy.

1333
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,510
Oh!

1334
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:31,530
Talk to me.

1335
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,530
It escaped.

1336
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,270
That was a difficult fight.

1337
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,550
Just driving it away was enough.

1338
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:40,050
And it's all thanks to you, man.

1339
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,170
Alright, I upped it a little bit.

1340
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,090
You're tougher than you look.

1341
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,830
That's twice now you're so weak.

1342
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,430
Tanya's just waiting for me in the town right now.

1343
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:48,290
Hahaha!

1344
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,070
Yes.

1345
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:54,630
Mitsuko created this Rift Space.

1346
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,350
A refuge from the dangers of the physical world.

1347
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:58,550
Or somewhere else.

1348
00:55:58,570 --> 00:55:58,790
I don't know what we thought.

1349
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,690
Do you think that deviation will come back?

1350
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,710
What if it returns with greater disruptions?

1351
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:05,550
It's possible.

1352
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:07,630
We can't just sit here and wait though.

1353
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,030
Meta, will you go back to the physical world with me?

1354
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,390
Alright.

1355
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:12,510
Sure.

1356
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,090
Wait, that wasn't even the physical world?

1357
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:16,390
There's...

1358
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,250
Oh, I thought...

1359
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,850
Oh yeah, this is a deviation world.

1360
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,610
That way, I can lend you some of my strength.

1361
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,650
Hopefully, we'll meet again one day.

1362
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,230
When the Stardust is stable enough.

1363
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,090
It looks like this is goodbye.

1364
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,550
I'm going to go back to the physical world.

1365
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:28,930
Oh, it's my battle type.

1366
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,310
Good luck, Meta.

1367
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:30,730
Goodbye.

1368
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,350
Goodbye.

1369
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,290
You can use any questions.

1370
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,650
I could try and answer them for you.

1371
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:37,610
Alright.

1372
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,090
Time to leave.

1373
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,250
It's time.

1374
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,290
We can finally...

1375
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:46,550
We can finally...

1376
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,130
Bunny bump into Tangent.

1377
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:50,330
We finally did it!

1378
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:51,450
Hahaha.

1379
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,180
Oh my god, I'm dropping down.

1380
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:21,840
Oh my god, Fortnite!

1381
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,840
Where am I going?

1382
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,300
Where... where... where do I go?

1383
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,960
Is this it?

1384
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,780
Where's like... where's where people would like hang out?

1385
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,040
Like, where do people hang out?

1386
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,400
Where are we dropping?

1387
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,580
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1388
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,960
Alright, I gotta make sure I don't do that.

1389
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,160
Make sure...

1390
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,360
Oh no, it's dark!

1391
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,700
It's dark and scary!

1392
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,280
Find a suitable location and press B here.

1393
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,960
Is it a place... a territory terminal?

1394
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,280
Wait, maybe he lives here.

1395
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,520
Maybe that's where he is.

1396
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,100
There's somebody house here.

1397
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,720
Who lives here?

1398
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,360
Oh, this is glitch's territory.

1399
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,380
Okay, that's... I don't think that's...

1400
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,540
Okay, forums and defies... okay.

1401
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,720
Alright, we gotta meet up with Tenjanelle.

1402
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,280
Hello?

1403
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:40,680
Hello?

1404
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,760
Hi!

1405
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,720
I'm fine.

1406
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,420
You're finally here!

1407
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,380
You're finally here!

1408
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,760
Yeah, I finally made it!

1409
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,540
Where are you?

1410
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,040
I'm...

1411
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,240
Don't worry about it.

1412
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,140
What do you mean, don't worry about it?

1413
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,780
Which world are you in?

1414
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,440
What do you mean?

1415
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,060
We're in the same server!

1416
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,240
It's an MMO!

1417
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,340
There's different worlds and shit!

1418
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,980
We chose the same server!

1419
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,260
There's in the chat on the number six is a...

1420
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,100
Wait, what?

1421
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,500
Someone's sniping us.

1422
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,040
Ten is in world six?

1423
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,080
Where am I?

1424
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,740
I'm world five!

1425
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,780
How do I get to world six?

1426
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,820
You gotta find a... teleportation tower.

1427
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,320
Teleportate?

1428
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,740
How did you learn so much?

1429
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,140
Yeah, the...

1430
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,140
What do you mean teleportation?

1431
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,360
Yeah, teleportation!

1432
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,140
What the fuck is that?

1433
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,740
I honestly have no clue.

1434
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,360
What the fuck is a teleportation tower?

1435
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,880
I wouldn't know, bro.

1436
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,220
I wouldn't...

1437
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,260
It's right there.

1438
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,440
I mean, I'm near one.

1439
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,340
How did you learn about the teleportations?

1440
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,180
Because I'm near one!

1441
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:52,620
Okay.

1442
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,480
How do I open the map?

1443
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:55,920
Okay.

1444
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,500
There is somebody...

1445
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,060
Oh, I found it!

1446
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:00,600
I found it!

1447
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,040
Okay, okay.

1448
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,140
You found it?

1449
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:02,760
I found it.

1450
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,060
Okay.

1451
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,260
How do I...

1452
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,040
How do I pin this?

1453
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,580
Okay, track.

1454
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,740
Place pin.

1455
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,080
Okay.

1456
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:10,340
There is...

1457
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:10,560
There we go.

1458
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,160
Alright, I figured it out.

1459
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,020
I'm heading there now.

1460
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,360
You figured it?

1461
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,920
It would have been a lot easier when I was in the sky if I knew that.

1462
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,240
Yep, probably.

1463
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,200
Oh my god.

1464
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,220
There is like some deviance in front of me.

1465
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,640
I'm gonna outrun this.

1466
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,180
I have a gun.

1467
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,900
How did you get a gun already?

1468
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,740
I have a gun.

1469
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,100
What the fuck?

1470
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,800
Just to let you know, I have a goddamn gun.

1471
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,300
You have a gun?

1472
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:41,800
With no suppressors.

1473
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,920
Also like...

1474
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,700
Okay, you've seen the trailers for this game before, right?

1475
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,280
Yep.

1476
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,440
This is not what I expected.

1477
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:48,520
This is not what I expected.

1478
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:49,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1479
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:50,960
I mean...

1480
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,600
I thought...

1481
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,680
I thought...

1482
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,080
I thought everybody was playing this game and I was like, oh, that's cool.

1483
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,240
Like, they're shooting monsters.

1484
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,100
It was like...

1485
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,140
What's that game called?

1486
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,680
The other...

1487
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,700
The other like Dark Souls-like game that's like for shooting?

1488
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,020
What is it called?

1489
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,420
The...

1490
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,320
It's like shooting Dark Souls.

1491
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:11,860
Rem...

1492
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:12,900
Remnant something?

1493
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:13,500
Yeah, yeah.

1494
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,760
I thought it would be like Remnant.

1495
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,200
I thought it would be like Remnant.

1496
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,420
Yeah, me too.

1497
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,160
That's what it looked like.

1498
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:23,060
And then I saw like gameplay from others and it looked like Remnant.

1499
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,680
So I was like...

1500
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,600
I'm like making a house.

1501
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,400
I'm crafting.

1502
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,740
I like...

1503
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,480
I thought it'd be like Remnant.

1504
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,940
Oh my god.

1505
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,020
We should have played Remnant instead.

1506
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,020
We should have...

1507
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,160
Okay.

1508
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,560
And let's...

1509
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,600
I'm heading up to the tower.

1510
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,260
I'm heading up.

1511
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,160
Oh, we're running.

1512
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:54,960
Oh my god.

1513
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,800
Yeah I met some people.

1514
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,880
I turned on voice chat just in case.

1515
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,440
There's a lot of people that I...

1516
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,380
I met actually.

1517
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:04,940
Oh shit, that's a dude.

1518
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,040
You met people already?

1519
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,840
How did you meet people?

1520
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,840
Like what were we doing?

1521
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:08,920
I don't know.

1522
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,480
I was just going around and they were like, oh, they were showing me stuff.

1523
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,060
Oh shit, they were hearing you?

1524
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:15,780
They were boosting you?

1525
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,120
No.

1526
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,820
Okay, they were boosting you.

1527
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,840
I stayed away from people because I hear them.

1528
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,220
Yeah, but you said they were helping you.

1529
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,020
No, they're just approaching me.

1530
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,220
I don't want to be approached.

1531
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,040
Okay, I'm here.

1532
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:30,840
I'm in the...

1533
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,900
I'm in world six.

1534
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,480
Where are you?

1535
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,860
Are you at the...

1536
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,780
I'm at the teleportation tower.

1537
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,920
I'm at 6940.

1538
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,280
69405041.

1539
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:41,460
What?

1540
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:42,920
695041.

1541
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,460
Okay, just follow the road.

1542
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:44,800
Holy shit.

1543
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,300
What the fuck is this map?

1544
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,200
Did you scroll back from the map?

1545
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:48,640
Yeah.

1546
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,120
Yeah.

1547
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,320
What the fuck?

1548
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,820
There's like some fucking places.

1549
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:55,220
There's like level 30, like the level 32 zone.

1550
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,700
Do you have...

1551
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,340
Okay, I have a question.

1552
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:57,920
Do you have pants?

1553
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,840
No, I didn't.

1554
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
I don't have pants.

1555
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,360
I don't have pants.

1556
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,660
Okay, like I could have wore pants, but for the dragoons, I did not wear pants.

1557
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:07,900
Oh, I didn't.

1558
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,340
I don't care.

1559
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:16,700
There was a way you can like... you can make pants, but I decided not to make pants.

1560
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,220
I did not have pants.

1561
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,000
All right.

1562
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,520
Wait, where are you?

1563
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,960
What do you mean follow the road?

1564
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,180
There's so many roads.

1565
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,260
Wait, where are you?

1566
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:26,620
I'm here.

1567
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,700
I'm at the teleportation tower.

1568
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:28,940
No, you're not.

1569
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:30,640
World six.

1570
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,200
I'm at world six too.

1571
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,080
Is that you?

1572
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:33,820
There's multiple...

1573
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,860
That's you, I see.

1574
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,320
Where are you?

1575
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:35,760
Where are you?

1576
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:37,880
Oh, there you are.

1577
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,480
You're so lucky there's no PVP.

1578
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,020
What the fuck?

1579
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,720
What do we do with this game?

1580
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,580
I honestly have no clue.

1581
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,180
I don't know.

1582
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:57,340
Trade.

1583
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:58,940
Add friends.

1584
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,180
Oh shit, yes.

1585
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:00,740
Okay.

1586
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,040
Hey, this is free.

1587
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:02,980
Invite the team?

1588
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:03,660
Yes.

1589
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,420
No, no way.

1590
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,400
Is it the other way around?

1591
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,440
How come you have your butterflies?

1592
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,240
We're mop...

1593
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:07,860
My butterfly is...

1594
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,620
I think my butterfly died.

1595
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:10,640
I think my butterfly...

1596
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,820
What the fuck happened to my butterfly?

1597
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,060
Where's your butterfly?

1598
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,260
Where did my butterfly go?

1599
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:15,920
He died!

1600
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,380
I wouldn't even know where your butterfly is.

1601
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,440
There's no air holes.

1602
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,220
There's no air holes.

1603
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,100
Oh shit.

1604
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:24,800
Is it the other way around?

1605
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:25,560
I think you should...

1606
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,400
You should...

1607
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,180
All right, wait.

1608
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,080
Why aren't you fighting?

1609
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:29,980
No, it's okay.

1610
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,320
You use your butterfly to fight.

1611
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:33,560
Okay, no.

1612
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:33,900
You know what?

1613
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,520
Transfer leadership.

1614
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:35,900
No, I don't want to be leader.

1615
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:36,580
What?

1616
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,420
How did you do that?

1617
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:37,860
I don't know.

1618
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,360
My butterfly is still dead!

1619
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,260
It doesn't do anything!

1620
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:42,660
What?

1621
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,520
My butterfly is still dead!

1622
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,260
Oh no, what happened to him?

1623
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,080
Make a base.

1624
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,640
Wait, we're going to make a base?

1625
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,060
Okay.

1626
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,400
What are we going to do?

1627
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:52,620
All right, you fight that guy.

1628
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,300
Did I just headbutt him?

1629
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,480
Yeah, you did.

1630
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,440
I'm going to loot your shit.

1631
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:57,540
All right.

1632
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,780
Rest in peace butterfly.

1633
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,140
Rest in peace.

1634
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,100
You're not head...

1635
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:04,720
That's my base.

1636
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,360
Welcome...

1637
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,400
Wait, is that your base?

1638
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:07,360
I'm...

1639
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:07,820
I'm...

1640
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:07,840
I'm trying to find my...

1641
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,260
Is that your base over there?

1642
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:09,960
What the fuck?

1643
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,720
This is my base.

1644
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,840
Give me a sec, I need to beat this guy up.

1645
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,240
I don't want to waste my arrow.

1646
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,400
Is this their base?

1647
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,300
Oh my god.

1648
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,560
Yeah, yeah, this is my base.

1649
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,160
What even... Oh, you have entered Tenjin's territory.

1650
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,480
Oh, it's because you have your... I didn't put my thing.

1651
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,460
I didn't put my terminal.

1652
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:29,720
Oh shit!

1653
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:30,860
The fuck?

1654
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:31,860
What?

1655
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:33,860
Oh, that guy shot you.

1656
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,640
Oh, I can't build it here because you own that area.

1657
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,960
Okay, this is my base too.

1658
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,800
This is my area.

1659
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:40,980
Okay.

1660
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,600
You're building it there?

1661
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,060
Yeah.

1662
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,700
Holy shit.

1663
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,340
You're just building it there.

1664
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,400
But seriously, making a base is not what I expected in this game.

1665
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:54,460
Me too.

1666
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,060
I told you, it's Ark.

1667
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,540
It's free to play Ark.

1668
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:03,100
Oh my god.

1669
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,480
Hello neighbor.

1670
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,160
Hi.

1671
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,020
Hey.

1672
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,280
You got your butterfly?

1673
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,740
I need to get my butterfly.

1674
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,020
Okay, use facility.

1675
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,840
Yeah, okay, my butterfly is here now.

1676
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,520
Yeah, there's my butterfly.

1677
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,140
There he is.

1678
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,440
Okay, tab to open the function window and select Creole to enter the metric screen.

1679
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,820
Open the... What the fuck?

1680
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,280
There's so much information in this game.

1681
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,240
I'll be honest.

1682
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,800
Oh, you can like upgrade info... What the fuck?

1683
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:33,900
Yeah, yeah.

1684
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,640
There's like... What?

1685
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,800
Yeah, there's some stuffs that...

1686
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,060
What?

1687
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,480
There's stoves?

1688
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:44,040
What the fuck am I looking at?

1689
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:45,660
Rainwater.

1690
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,860
Might as well.

1691
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,140
Let's grab rainwater.

1692
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,480
I need that water.

1693
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,200
It's important.

1694
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,300
What the fuck?

1695
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,360
Oh my god.

1696
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,960
This is...

1697
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,260
This is definitely not what I expected.

1698
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:02,700
Me neither.

1699
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,420
I don't... Defense?

1700
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:09,640
No, this is like 7 days to die plus arc.

1701
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:14,580
Because there's like defense stuff against the deviant slash zombies.

1702
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,720
The copyright free zombies.

1703
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,020
Zombies.

1704
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,340
Hell yeah.

1705
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,740
They're smelting?

1706
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,580
Oh my god, I'm getting overwhelmed here.

1707
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,560
I'm actually...

1708
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,900
Yeah, there's so much.

1709
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,380
This is a lot more than I expected.

1710
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,460
Yeah.

1711
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:34,080
How much more do I have?

1712
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,400
I bought ammunition.

1713
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:38,860
Okay.

1714
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,560
Alright, I used up everything.

1715
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:42,640
Uh...

1716
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:44,260
Okay.

1717
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,120
I used up all my upgrade stuff.

1718
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,220
I did it.

1719
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,520
And unlocked the disassembly bench.

1720
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,460
Oh shit, I did not unlock...

1721
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,460
I did not unlock the thing that they want me to lock.

1722
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,420
Oh shit, there's the disassembly.

1723
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,940
Well, I have a disassembly bench.

1724
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,100
Yeah, they're like...

1725
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,400
Make sure to unlock the disassembly bench.

1726
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,740
And I was like... No.

1727
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:08,960
Nah.

1728
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,040
Okay.

1729
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,180
I don't want this.

1730
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,540
Okay.

1731
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,740
Alright, there you go.

1732
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,320
Territory upgrades?

1733
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,920
I can have more territory than this.

1734
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,140
I think you gotta grab one?

1735
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,320
Territory expansion.

1736
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,580
What the fuck?

1737
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,580
What is even happening?

1738
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:29,460
I want boots.

1739
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,420
Okay.

1740
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:34,020
Uh...

1741
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:35,640
Facilities.

1742
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,720
Disassembly bench.

1743
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,200
Okay.

1744
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,380
Oh, I don't have gravel.

1745
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:40,720
Wait.

1746
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,500
Where the fuck is gravel?

1747
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,640
It's in the rock.

1748
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,880
It's in the rock?

1749
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,160
Okay.

1750
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:46,740
Take me there.

1751
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:47,900
What?

1752
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:48,700
I don't even know.

1753
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,260
Where is it?

1754
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,320
These rocks?

1755
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,140
The bigger ones?

1756
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,120
Yeah.

1757
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,580
Oh, these.

1758
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,740
When did we fucking kill them?

1759
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:58,860
.

1760
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,920
That's what I like to know.

1761
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,720
When do we get to shoot shoots?

1762
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:06,660
When do we shoot things?

1763
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:10,260
When are we fighting some bosses and do shit, you know?

1764
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:10,520
What the fuck?

1765
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,560
I thought we were gonna fight bosses.

1766
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,180
I thought this was gonna be remnant.

1767
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:16,780
Bro.

1768
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:20,420
So it's like, it's Palworld all over again.

1769
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,800
Oh my god.

1770
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,440
You can never escape from Palworld.

1771
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,440
I need copper.

1772
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,840
They're forcing me to build a tower.

1773
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,000
Wait, I can share my stuff.

1774
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,020
Wait, we can share.

1775
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,040
You can share?

1776
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:35,880
Yeah.

1777
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,100
What do you need?

1778
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,900
Oh, we can share stuff.

1779
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,300
So if you have stuff, you can share it to me.

1780
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,660
Oh my god.

1781
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,620
It's Palworld without the pals.

1782
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,240
Guys, we can't just suddenly switch to remnant.

1783
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,580
Tenjin has to download something for two plus hours.

1784
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,120
Tenjin has to download something for two plus hours.

1785
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,260
This was free.

1786
01:09:58,860 --> 01:09:59,040
Yeah.

1787
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,820
At least this was free.

1788
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,780
Oh wait, there is copper.

1789
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,280
There's a lot of coppers.

1790
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:08,400
Yeah, there's so much coffee here.

1791
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,460
Where the fuck are the people?

1792
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:12,880
You don't want...

1793
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,720
You don't want to talk to the people.

1794
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,800
You don't want to talk...

1795
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,780
I just want handouts.

1796
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,200
You just want handouts.

1797
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,640
Any snipers in the server, we're willing to give their stuff.

1798
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,440
We'll take a gun.

1799
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,260
We'll take a gun or two.

1800
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,160
Yeah, yeah.

1801
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,200
We just want handouts.

1802
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,400
That's all we want.

1803
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,220
So we can go straight to the bosses.

1804
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,220
So we can go straight to the bosses.

1805
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,900
Just boom, boom, boom.

1806
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,500
We just want to have the boss fight.

1807
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,960
This is the only reason.

1808
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:45,720
Okay.

1809
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,860
Alright, disassembly.

1810
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,300
You got the stuff.

1811
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,100
How the fuck...

1812
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,060
Wait, I need copper ingots?

1813
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,940
What the fuck?

1814
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:58,260
I need to make ingots?

1815
01:10:58,860 --> 01:10:59,500
You smith it?

1816
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:01,420
Yeah.

1817
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,300
I have a furnace if you want to use it.

1818
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,520
Yeah, I'm going to use your furnace.

1819
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,900
Can I use your furnace?

1820
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,360
I don't want to waste my...

1821
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,580
I think you can.

1822
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,480
Wait, what the fuck?

1823
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,420
Oh, I can!

1824
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,420
Oh my god!

1825
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,880
Wait, how do I put my ingots?

1826
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,020
This game is stupid.

1827
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,220
You have a chest already.

1828
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,080
What the fuck?

1829
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,200
Wait, how do I...

1830
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,660
I told you I was making a base and I'm not even lying.

1831
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,440
Wait, how do I put my ingots in your inventory?

1832
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,880
I can't do it.

1833
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,220
Wait, what is this?

1834
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,140
Why do you have two furnaces?

1835
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:39,580
Because you can only smelt one item at a time.

1836
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:40,720
Wait, I need the...

1837
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,820
You need a charcoal, I think.

1838
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,840
I need charcoal?

1839
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,600
How the fuck?

1840
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,260
Put charcoal in it right now.

1841
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,700
What the fuck?

1842
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,840
Well, I dropped...

1843
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,080
Oh, I only have one charcoal.

1844
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:52,440
Yeah.

1845
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,960
Put it so I can start crafting.

1846
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,680
There, I'll just... 20 seconds.

1847
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,300
20 seconds?

1848
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,400
No, I don't see it.

1849
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,660
Is it because I have to use my own?

1850
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,420
This is bullshit.

1851
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,200
This is...

1852
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:16,410
You know, I was tempted to craft a fishing rod.

1853
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:18,370
A fishing rod?

1854
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:21,250
Yeah, might as well just fish in this fucking...

1855
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,290
I don't know.

1856
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:24,850
Maybe I'll craft a fishing rod.

1857
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:26,930
Just for old times' sake.

1858
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,370
How do I...

1859
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:28,350
Alright.

1860
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:30,730
Let's see.

1861
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:32,550
Oh my god, I don't even have it unlocked!

1862
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:34,870
It never told me to unlock the furnace!

1863
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:35,950
Ah!

1864
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:38,490
Wait, how do I...

1865
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,230
How do I share this with you?

1866
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:43,470
I need to unlock a furnace.

1867
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:45,290
I actually needed the furnace.

1868
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:45,790
Okay.

1869
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:49,070
I need to reset this.

1870
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:50,190
Okay.

1871
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:51,910
Smithing.

1872
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,390
Did you get this from the chest?

1873
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:56,910
Alright.

1874
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,190
Oh yeah, I'm gonna...

1875
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,970
I'm gonna build...

1876
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:01,550
I'm gonna build a furnace now.

1877
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:05,290
Uh... where the fuck is the furnace?

1878
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:07,350
Where is it?

1879
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,130
I thought I bought... oh there it is.

1880
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:10,430
Alright.

1881
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,070
Oh, thank god.

1882
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:18,030
Okay.

1883
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:20,550
Oh yeah, okay, I got it.

1884
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,470
Yeah, you need... it needed to...

1885
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,390
Uh...

1886
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:26,890
Like, I need... I can't use yours.

1887
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:27,870
I have to use my own.

1888
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:30,870
Wasabi wants to... who the fuck is Wasabi?

1889
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,750
Is Wasabi gonna fucking boost us?

1890
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:34,270
I don't know.

1891
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,970
Probably.

1892
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:35,530
You know what?

1893
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:36,230
Fuck it, Wasabi.

1894
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:37,830
Get in here.

1895
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:38,810
You're level 10.

1896
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,210
How do I get glass?

1897
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,790
How do I get glass?

1898
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,210
Wait, we have to fucking...

1899
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,690
You're like ahead of me, so you're like...

1900
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,210
We need glass now.

1901
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:55,090
I'm like, what do you mean we need glass?

1902
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:57,330
Don't worry about it.

1903
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:59,050
What do you mean we need glass?

1904
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:01,070
I need glass.

1905
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,410
What do we need glass for?

1906
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,350
I need glass.

1907
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:05,690
You might not need it yet.

1908
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:06,350
I need glass.

1909
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:07,190
Oh no.

1910
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:09,090
Okay.

1911
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,310
I need to make 10...

1912
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:13,650
copper ingots?

1913
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:14,750
Oh my god.

1914
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:15,750
Okay.

1915
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,630
Let's keep crafting.

1916
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:19,550
Just keep crafting.

1917
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:22,570
You have nothing to worry about.

1918
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,010
Just keep crafting.

1919
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,710
Just keep crafting.

1920
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:27,690
Keep doing it.

1921
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,170
I was just spamming once.

1922
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:31,350
And I realized I could just craft all.

1923
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,270
Okay.

1924
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:36,030
Give me...

1925
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:37,190
Alright.

1926
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:39,430
And I can craft more.

1927
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:41,790
Oh my god.

1928
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:42,070
Alright.

1929
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,970
Wasabi wanted to join our team.

1930
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,110
And then Wasabi...

1931
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:48,150
Wasabi left us.

1932
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:51,410
That's funny.

1933
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:54,410
No one wants to be...

1934
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,410
on our team.

1935
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:57,910
I don't understand.

1936
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:00,070
We just want to get carried.

1937
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:01,750
We just want...

1938
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:05,010
We just want handouts.

1939
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:06,670
We need to make a guild.

1940
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,010
Is that too much to ask for?

1941
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,770
Customer support.

1942
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,270
We just...

1943
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:16,630
We just want handouts.

1944
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:18,510
We just want handouts.

1945
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:18,770
Yeah.

1946
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:19,490
Yeah.

1947
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,530
We don't want much in life.

1948
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,570
Just handouts.

1949
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:28,070
To share a base, it needs to be in the same guild.

1950
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,190
How do you make a guild?

1951
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:29,190
Oh!

1952
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:29,630
Okay.

1953
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:30,590
You make the guild.

1954
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:32,930
You learn how to make a guild.

1955
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,950
I'm gonna go fucking loot shit.

1956
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:36,670
I wanna loot shit.

1957
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:37,190
No!

1958
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:38,070
What?

1959
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,410
You learn how to make a guild right now.

1960
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:44,110
How am I supposed to make a guild?

1961
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:44,290
It's okay.

1962
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,370
We have number six.

1963
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:46,730
Who's number six?

1964
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:48,970
Number six is gonna...

1965
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:50,710
Number six was the guy that was like...

1966
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:53,310
You're at the wrong world, Doki!

1967
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:55,230
Number six is gonna...

1968
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:55,350
Oh shit!

1969
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:56,330
Give us handouts!

1970
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,390
Oh shit!

1971
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,850
He want handouts or not!

1972
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:02,510
I definitely do want a handout.

1973
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:02,990
Exactly!

1974
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:05,270
Number six is the chosen one.

1975
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,090
Number six.

1976
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:08,590
Number six!

1977
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:09,910
Give us handouts!

1978
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,830
I love this.

1979
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:16,170
Alright, let's see.

1980
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,210
My crafting?

1981
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:19,510
Chat.

1982
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:19,950
Able.

1983
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:20,570
Able help me.

1984
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:22,190
Alright.

1985
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:23,490
Am I good to go?

1986
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:27,390
Okay, I can finally build a disassembly thing.

1987
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:28,690
Alright.

1988
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,030
Hell yeah.

1989
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:30,590
Is that a deer?

1990
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:31,510
Die!

1991
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:33,270
You're gonna kill a deer?

1992
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:34,430
What do you need deer for?

1993
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,350
We have enough food.

1994
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:35,630
Wait!

1995
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:37,790
We have number six to give us handouts!

1996
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,610
We have number six to give us handouts!

1997
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:40,630
Bro, I noob still.

1998
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,270
Bro, AF.

1999
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:42,370
But I'll work hard.

2000
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:46,010
But well, at least show us some effort.

2001
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:47,370
But well, at least show us some effort.

2002
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:48,950
I'm sure I build a disassembly.

2003
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:52,630
I'm sure you did.

2004
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,780
Okay, let's see.

2005
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:00,120
Okay, let's see.

2006
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,140
Uh...

2007
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,700
I need to build disassembly.

2008
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:05,080
I need to build disassembly.

2009
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,040
Uh...

2010
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,280
Oh my god.

2011
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,320
I'm always so confused when I'm building.

2012
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:12,740
I have no idea what this is even for.

2013
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:16,160
Building in these kinds of games gets me overwhelmed sometimes.

2014
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:16,440
Building in these kinds of games gets me overwhelmed sometimes.

2015
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,800
Yeah, no, there's so much stuff.

2016
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,440
Yeah.

2017
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,520
Like I unlock one stuff and then there's another better option.

2018
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,720
I was like, ah.

2019
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:25,960
Wait, disassembly scrap at...

2020
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,820
Wait, this is like...

2021
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,140
This is...

2022
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,940
This is Rust.

2023
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,780
This is...

2024
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,680
Wait a minute.

2025
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,860
Wait, this is Rust.

2026
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,580
You're not wrong for that.

2027
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,220
This disassembly thing is Rust.

2028
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,440
But honestly, I've never played Rust.

2029
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,440
Oh my god.

2030
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:45,600
This is...

2031
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,220
So I wouldn't know.

2032
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:48,520
This is everything!

2033
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,320
Oh shit, I get to claim rewards though.

2034
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:54,600
Yeah!

2035
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:00,300
The people in chat was like, it's been Rust this entire time.

2036
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,140
It's been Rust this entire time.

2037
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,800
Maybe Rust was us all along.

2038
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,400
It was us all along.

2039
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,840
Okay, how do we make a guild?

2040
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,760
Guys, we want to make a guild.

2041
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,380
Press U, go to guild.

2042
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:14,280
Oh.

2043
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:17,780
Wait.

2044
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,740
A hive.

2045
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,420
There we go.

2046
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,320
Create hive.

2047
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,940
That's what it's called?

2048
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:24,720
Hive?

2049
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,760
Yeah, what do you want?

2050
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:27,780
What's the name?

2051
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:29,820
Dragoon.

2052
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:31,320
Give us handouts.

2053
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:33,480
Oh, free handouts.

2054
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,200
Name it Dragoons.

2055
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,100
Free handouts.

2056
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,260
Dragoon employers.

2057
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:45,020
Shit, what's a good name?

2058
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,740
Give me a good name, guys.

2059
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,020
Dragoon Incorporated.

2060
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:52,980
Dragoon Inc.

2061
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,380
Dragoon Inc.

2062
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,200
Help.

2063
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,140
We're striving.

2064
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,780
Join our guild.

2065
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,940
Join our guild.

2066
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,540
Dragoon Inc.

2067
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:08,540
Please.

2068
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,240
Is it free?

2069
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,800
Please tell me it's free.

2070
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,500
It's free!

2071
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,000
Tell your recruit member.

2072
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:13,460
Yeah!

2073
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,400
Recruit me.

2074
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,580
I want to join Dragoon.

2075
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:15,880
Dragoon Inc.

2076
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,000
Oh shit.

2077
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,480
Join Dragoon Inc.

2078
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:20,900
today!

2079
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,340
So you can provide us guns.

2080
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,820
And we can fight a boss instantly.

2081
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,740
How do I invite you to the guild?

2082
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:30,200
How do I invite you to the guild?

2083
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:30,860
Oh, fucking no.

2084
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:33,320
Jesus.

2085
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:35,940
Maybe you have to search it?

2086
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,140
Wait, how do you find the guild?

2087
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:44,300
Press U and then there's like a hive.

2088
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:44,760
Press U and then there's like a hive.

2089
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,020
Uh huh.

2090
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,280
Press U and then there's like a hive.

2091
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,400
Uh huh.

2092
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,200
Oh, find hive.

2093
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:48,760
Okay.

2094
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,920
Yeah, Dragoon.

2095
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,200
Okay, let's see.

2096
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,120
There is a lot.

2097
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,560
Dragoon.

2098
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,920
I like how there's like one that's like no game.

2099
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,460
There's no Dragoon.

2100
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,120
Dragoon.

2101
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,820
There's Ethan and Jake.

2102
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,100
We should have joined...

2103
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,660
Who the hell is Ethan and Jake?

2104
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:07,720
I don't know.

2105
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,460
But there's a hive called Ethan and Jake.

2106
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,560
But there's a hive called Ethan and Jake.

2107
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,700
Wait, I wanna join Ethan and...

2108
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:19,860
But who the fuck is Ethan and Jake?

2109
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,120
I wanna apply to Ethan and Jake's hive.

2110
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,440
Why did you apply to Ethan?

2111
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,760
I did it, but I like Ethan and Jake.

2112
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,680
Invite to the hive.

2113
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,120
There we go.

2114
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,860
I sent you an application.

2115
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,740
He sent me an application.

2116
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,280
But Ethan and Jake!

2117
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:38,880
Jake!

2118
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,640
Ethan and Jake look so cool!

2119
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:50,640
It's not fair!

2120
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,040
I'm gonna transfer you to leadership.

2121
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,560
No, stop transferring me to leadership!

2122
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,300
Because it's not my ship!

2123
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,560
It's your name and the company!

2124
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:05,160
I wanted to join Ethan and Jake!

2125
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,240
What?

2126
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,700
Ethan and Jake...

2127
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,320
looked like they were having fun.

2128
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,580
Wait, what?

2129
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:18,900
There's flight mode.

2130
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,080
There's flight mode?

2131
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,320
Okay, what do we do now that we have a guild?

2132
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,500
I honestly don't know.

2133
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:28,340
Wait, what?

2134
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,180
You're the one that suggested the guild!

2135
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,780
My chat says to get the guild...

2136
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,520
Verse number 6!

2137
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,580
Wait, number 6 has like...

2138
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:39,500
a cool shirt and underwear!

2139
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:45,440
Does number 6 even know what he's doing?

2140
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,620
I don't know actually.

2141
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,720
Hive review.

2142
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,280
There's no Hive history.

2143
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,740
Our Hive fucking sucks.

2144
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,060
We're just here!

2145
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:02,140
I bet Ethan and Jake...

2146
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,920
make this place cooler.

2147
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:04,900
Dispermissive.

2148
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,140
We're just here!

2149
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:11,420
Where is it?

2150
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,600
We should join Ethan and Jake.

2151
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,560
Come on, let's apply it to their guild!

2152
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,920
Let's do it!

2153
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,500
Apply to the guild!

2154
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,480
Apply to Ethan and Jake's guild!

2155
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:25,900
It'll be so fun!

2156
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,280
Maybe Ethan and Jake will carry us.

2157
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,640
Maybe Ethan and Jake will carry us.

2158
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,060
I can't even report?

2159
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,040
Wait, what do you mean?

2160
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,120
I can report my own guild.

2161
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:39,800
That's funny.

2162
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,400
I made the guild and I can report it myself.

2163
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,820
That's so stupid.

2164
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,580
Oh shit.

2165
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,740
Let's see...

2166
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,760
Yeah, I can report it.

2167
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,060
I can just leave your guild.

2168
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,120
Just leave it.

2169
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,920
What the fuck is Warband?

2170
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,120
Oh, that's like the guild leadership...

2171
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,580
Oh, they're like the guild...

2172
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:02,620
rankings.

2173
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,500
Yeah, the leaderboards.

2174
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,880
Oh my fucking god.

2175
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:06,920
Oh my god.

2176
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,040
I hope Ethan and Jake are having a good time.

2177
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:11,980
I hope.

2178
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:15,760
Alright, let's figure out our first mission.

2179
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:16,320
Let's figure out our first mission.

2180
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,840
Go to the Monolith Ruin to search for supplies.

2181
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:19,900
Did you go there yet?

2182
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,600
I went there, yeah.

2183
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,760
You already did that mission?

2184
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,000
I did that, but I have not done the next one.

2185
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:26,800
What's the next one?

2186
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,960
Okay, I have to do it.

2187
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:28,880
Where is it?

2188
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:29,860
Where's the Monolith Ruin?

2189
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,220
You come with me!

2190
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,060
What do you mean?

2191
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:33,420
Yeah, alright.

2192
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,640
This is a collab!

2193
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,560
Yeah, I'll follow you.

2194
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,280
I don't even know where the fucking place is anymore.

2195
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:40,620
What do you mean?

2196
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,140
Oh hey, there's number 6.

2197
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:43,860
Number 6?

2198
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:44,740
There's number 6.

2199
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,640
That's the guy that's in our guild.

2200
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,760
No, who's this?

2201
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,800
That's the guy that was like...

2202
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,180
That's the guy that was...

2203
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:57,580
Yeah, that's number 6.

2204
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,360
What do you mean?

2205
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:00,080
There's nobody there.

2206
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:01,680
What the heck?

2207
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,060
I'm scared.

2208
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,200
There's no friend in...

2209
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,100
There's nobody there.

2210
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,300
Yo, what the fuck?

2211
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,300
What did you see?

2212
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,900
I don't know, bro.

2213
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:13,200
I have no clue.

2214
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,800
I'm gonna raise the volume a little bit more.

2215
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,320
Let's see...

2216
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:20,400
Alright.

2217
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,000
Alright.

2218
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,180
Yeah!

2219
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,620
Wait, how did you do that?

2220
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:29,180
I have a whole emote list.

2221
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,520
Wait, how did you do that?

2222
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,160
What's the list?

2223
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:35,100
Shit, where is it?

2224
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:36,940
What button is that?

2225
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:38,740
Shit...

2226
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,960
Probably in the same menu as the memetics.

2227
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:42,420
Probably in the same menu as the memetics.

2228
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,860
Okay, I need to go to...

2229
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:46,560
What the fuck is so far?

2230
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,300
Is it this?

2231
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:48,680
It's not.

2232
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,580
There's fast travel.

2233
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:51,320
There is?

2234
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,840
How did you fast travel?

2235
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:53,760
Where is it?

2236
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:57,040
Yeah, you can fast travel to the base, but I'm not sure of going there.

2237
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,600
Wait, where the fuck is the fast travel?

2238
01:24:59,800 --> 01:24:59,940
Wait, where the fuck is the fast travel?

2239
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:01,380
Teleport.

2240
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,360
I know, but where?

2241
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,240
Which one did you teleport?

2242
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:09,680
Not the mission, but I can teleport to the home.

2243
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,440
Oh, you go there and then you teleport back.

2244
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:12,880
Oh, you go there and then you teleport back.

2245
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,340
Is that what you mean?

2246
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:13,960
Yeah.

2247
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:14,220
Oh, okay.

2248
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,460
Well, I still have to go there.

2249
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,920
Yeah, let's go lead the way.

2250
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,000
Alright, it's this way.

2251
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,040
You can glide.

2252
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,780
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

2253
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:26,280
I think I find...

2254
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,020
I'm pretty sure.

2255
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,300
Alright, it's this way.

2256
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,460
I'm trying to figure out the movement.

2257
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:32,620
Yay!

2258
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,080
And you're actually challenged.

2259
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:38,940
No, because the map tracker thing makes it look like it's...

2260
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:43,260
They make you follow the road instead of the shortest way.

2261
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:43,880
Well, well...

2262
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:49,280
You have to follow road safety laws, you know?

2263
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,100
Yeah.

2264
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,320
And I'm just like, yeah, no.

2265
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:54,000
I do not care.

2266
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:56,240
I just go straight through.

2267
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,160
It's not like that you have cars or anything.

2268
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,940
I'm assuming there is cars.

2269
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:01,600
Well, there is.

2270
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,920
Oh, there's a guy right in front of us!

2271
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,800
We should have done PvP.

2272
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:05,700
No.

2273
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:07,180
You're right.

2274
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,340
They would have killed us anyway.

2275
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,940
They would have 100% killed us.

2276
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:12,960
Alright.

2277
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,200
I can't believe it.

2278
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,800
There's people in front of us.

2279
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,200
Mm-hmm.

2280
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:19,580
Alright, let's... I'm almost there.

2281
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,460
I'm so smart with my gliding thing.

2282
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,080
Oh my god.

2283
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,900
This is rust.

2284
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:28,980
Alright.

2285
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:29,900
Guys.

2286
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,980
If you guys want to stream tonight with us, then give us handouts.

2287
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,620
Feel free to join our server.

2288
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,400
Feel free to join our guild.

2289
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,560
Feel free to join our guild.

2290
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:40,880
Feel free to join the server.

2291
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,400
I can't believe this is like an MMO as well.

2292
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:44,380
I can't believe this is like an MMO as well.

2293
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:44,700
Yeah.

2294
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,800
I was thinking of something else.

2295
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,420
Like, no, I was literally thinking of...

2296
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:49,580
Oh shit, a deer.

2297
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,900
I thought this was Remnant.

2298
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,360
I literally saw the trailer.

2299
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,580
And it looked like Remnant.

2300
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,840
It literally looked like Remnant.

2301
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,300
Well...

2302
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,380
Honestly, I can't trust anything nowadays.

2303
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,320
Yeah, I can't trust things anymore.

2304
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:06,420
Like, no, I watched the gameplay videos too.

2305
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:07,480
Like, no, I watched the gameplay videos too.

2306
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,180
And it was like...

2307
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:09,800
It reminded me of Remnant.

2308
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,400
And like the other extraction shooter.

2309
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:13,760
The one with like...

2310
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,400
With like monsters.

2311
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:17,180
Was it Ashes?

2312
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,080
Whatever it's called.

2313
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:18,980
Ash?

2314
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:20,620
Gosh, I don't know.

2315
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,460
I'm trying to remember what it's called.

2316
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,280
I haven't really kept up with any games.

2317
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,600
Like upcoming stuff.

2318
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:30,740
Because basically, everything has been a disappointment.

2319
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,440
Yeah, that's so true.

2320
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:34,420
I played the beta.

2321
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,340
It was really good.

2322
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:36,500
Was the beta like this?

2323
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,040
Was the beta like this?

2324
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,280
Like somebody was like...

2325
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,440
I mean, I wouldn't say the game sucks.

2326
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,200
Bro, this guy has a motorcycle.

2327
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,360
What the fuck?

2328
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,060
How long has he been playing this game?

2329
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,720
He has a bed!

2330
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:53,440
He's level 9!

2331
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:56,680
Bro, wait, I can use their bed.

2332
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:56,720
I can use their bed.

2333
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:57,740
You're level 2?

2334
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:58,240
Crazy.

2335
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:00,540
Oh my god.

2336
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,260
It was always advertised as a survival.

2337
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:09,360
It just...

2338
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,620
When I watched the trailer, it didn't seem like a survival game.

2339
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,900
It had more combat.

2340
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:18,840
You do your stuff.

2341
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:20,680
You got the thing.

2342
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,840
Look for Rosetta supplies.

2343
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,920
Oh, we have to look around for more supplies?

2344
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:26,260
Yeah.

2345
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,680
I'm gonna start snapping.

2346
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,520
You talk to a lady.

2347
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:32,780
And then...

2348
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,180
Oh, and then...

2349
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:37,400
Wait, somebody's house has turrets and everything.

2350
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,420
Well...

2351
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:40,760
It's Fallout 4.

2352
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,720
No, it's Rust.

2353
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,420
Another settlement needs your help.

2354
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:46,640
No!

2355
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:49,460
Alright, let's grab this.

2356
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,320
I hear you.

2357
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:57,080
Are they good friends?

2358
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,280
Are they good people?

2359
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,320
I mean, it's 2v2.

2360
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:00,820
Who is it?

2361
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,440
Yeah, they can't fight us anyway.

2362
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,660
I need to collect 6 discarded items nearby.

2363
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:06,860
Wait, these?

2364
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,220
Oh, okay.

2365
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:11,740
Go to the entrance of the monolith.

2366
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,100
The fuck?

2367
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:13,880
Oh, it's over here.

2368
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:15,880
Yeah, the...

2369
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,360
Mary!

2370
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,220
Hello, Mary.

2371
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:25,100
Oh.

2372
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:28,620
Yeah, I don't see your name on it.

2373
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,240
Bitch.

2374
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,000
You are pretty cocky for someone who doesn't even have a weapon.

2375
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:34,100
You are pretty cocky for someone who doesn't even have a weapon.

2376
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,460
Quite impressive, to be honest.

2377
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:43,500
Since you can fast travel, I'm gonna go back to the base for a while, just to give it a little bit of a modification.

2378
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:44,940
Alright.

2379
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,600
Oh, this guy's a meta human too!

2380
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,520
I'm Mary.

2381
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,360
It's a good thing I met you.

2382
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,740
Oh, now she's nice to me.

2383
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:58,160
We should be able to help each other out.

2384
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,060
I came here to investigate a deviation that's been causing issues.

2385
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:04,640
I think it's connected to a recently reopened monolith nearby.

2386
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,100
The deer.

2387
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:06,500
The deer.

2388
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:08,860
Uh...

2389
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:10,760
I'm chasing deviation as well.

2390
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,180
Don't tell me you're going to try and take on a powerful deviation barehanded.

2391
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,260
Even an ordinary...

2392
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:16,800
I have a bow!

2393
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,700
...divine can tear you apart right now.

2394
01:30:18,820 --> 01:30:19,140
Yeah.

2395
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,040
I was like, oh no you don't.

2396
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:21,740
You don't have anything.

2397
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:22,660
What do you mean?

2398
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:23,480
I have a bow!

2399
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:24,580
We have a guild!

2400
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:30,300
It's not as good as Ethan and Jake, but like, we have a guild.

2401
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,640
Jesus Christ.

2402
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:49,280
Okay.

2403
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,100
Oh, wait!

2404
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:51,180
She gave me a gun!

2405
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,020
The Huntsman!

2406
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,080
So another mayfly survived.

2407
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,040
Insufficient permission.

2408
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:56,560
Why?

2409
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,720
This is my territory.

2410
01:30:58,940 --> 01:30:59,460
Oh.

2411
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,800
I can teleport back home now.

2412
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,540
How do I not share the existence of Mitsuko?

2413
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,220
How do I move the shit?

2414
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:07,820
What are you doing?

2415
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,600
How do I move my stuff?

2416
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,380
That's my question.

2417
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:12,980
Up into your house.

2418
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:15,900
Um...

2419
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,400
A store.

2420
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:19,920
Why do you store it?

2421
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,160
You don't want to be a scavenger.

2422
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,040
You don't want to be my neighbor?

2423
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:22,840
No.

2424
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,220
I want to move it to a better place.

2425
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:25,960
What do you mean?

2426
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,620
You chose this area!

2427
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,060
The only reason why!

2428
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:30,580
I was following a goddamn tutorial!

2429
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:34,500
The only reason why I lived here was because you lived there.

2430
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,900
And now you're gonna disasem- Oh, I see.

2431
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,200
I see.

2432
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:42,840
Now that I moved next to you, you're gonna move away.

2433
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:43,340
Nah.

2434
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:44,560
You're saying stuff.

2435
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:45,500
You're saying stuff.

2436
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,020
I see!

2437
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,000
Unlock the gear workbench.

2438
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,160
Why do you wanna move?

2439
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,200
I need a flatter surface.

2440
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:02,380
This is flat- Dude, I live next to a cliff!

2441
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,020
Dude, I live next to a cliff!

2442
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,200
What's wrong with that?

2443
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:07,240
What's wrong with that?

2444
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,500
What's wrong with that, damn?

2445
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:13,380
What's wrong with that, damn?

2446
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:15,600
Okay, I need a gear workdrop.

2447
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,380
Okay, I need a gear workdrop.

2448
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:19,880
Oh, I got a baseball bat, too!

2449
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,900
I have all the materials, guys.

2450
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,160
Gear workbench.

2451
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:26,700
Need more copper?

2452
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:27,900
Oh my god!

2453
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,480
I need more copper!

2454
01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:32,760
Yeah, I love these copper ores!

2455
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,940
I miss having handouts.

2456
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,960
Not to play the game for real.

2457
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,880
The structure cannot be built near a strong- How do I move?

2458
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,360
How do I move?

2459
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,100
I need to move my shit!

2460
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:51,020
I forgot what it was like to actually play a game for real.

2461
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:54,020
Goddamn.

2462
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,340
Back to the mines I go!

2463
01:32:58,100 --> 01:32:58,620
Back to the mines I go!

2464
01:32:58,620 --> 01:32:59,760
Back to the mines I go!

2465
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,120
Relocate.

2466
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:06,600
Time to actually ride.

2467
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,580
Time to actually ride.

2468
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,740
Move territory.

2469
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:12,000
I can't.

2470
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,480
People enable me.

2471
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,300
Oh, I can move territory.

2472
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,480
Okay, that's how you move territory.

2473
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,000
All right.

2474
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,100
Okay, let's see.

2475
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,360
Hold up.

2476
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,500
Is there any flatter surface in this?

2477
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:20,900
Jeez.

2478
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:23,460
There's a lot of people's homes.

2479
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,880
I can't believe you moved away.

2480
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:27,640
Look.

2481
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:30,620
Where the fuck did you move to?

2482
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,280
Hold on, hold on.

2483
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:33,500
This is still your territory.

2484
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,020
I'm trying to move it.

2485
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,080
I'm moving my territory.

2486
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:38,420
No, you're not.

2487
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,680
What the fuck?

2488
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,880
I need a flatter surface, man.

2489
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,720
Everybody claimed everything.

2490
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,340
It's just like my Minecraft game.

2491
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:46,720
Minecraft server.

2492
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,560
You have a minecraft server.

2493
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:57,800
I logged into my minecraft server and literally everything was claimed even the oceans that were around me.

2494
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,760
I have a game.

2495
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:18,160
I'm slowly hiring a moderation team for the minecraft server and one of the mods that we had mods that we hired to do the minecraft server they are crying in the mod chat being like, there's no I don't know where to build my home!

2496
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:21,680
All the dragoons have taken all the land!

2497
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:30,100
And I was like, reading the chat, and I got in the server and I was like, alright, let's find you a home.

2498
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:36,640
And we literally rode the boat for like, hundreds of blocks that were surrounding me.

2499
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,740
Like, in the ocean!

2500
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:44,200
In the entire ocean that surrounded the territory, the land was claimed.

2501
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:54,600
We were on the boat for like, an hour just trying to find an unclaimed land.

2502
01:34:55,420 --> 01:35:00,580
And then I felt bad and I just like, I was like, okay, you can build on my land.

2503
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:03,980
You can build on my land!

2504
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:13,220
Overlaps with battle unit, what does that even mean?

2505
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:15,480
Are you still trying to find land to claim?

2506
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:16,340
I'm sorry!

2507
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,120
I'm literally watching you from here!

2508
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,200
I don't get it.

2509
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,100
This is crazy.

2510
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:26,460
There's so much prerequisites to like, fucking build a house!

2511
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,740
I'm literally still watching you try...

2512
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:31,720
This is the only game where I can have a fucking affordable housing!

2513
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:36,460
I'm literally still watching you try to find a place!

2514
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:40,520
Holy shit!

2515
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:45,820
Holy shit!

2516
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:48,160
I'm just gonna watch you!

2517
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,240
I'm watching you walk!

2518
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,820
Oh my fucking god, it does not auto-build?

2519
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:54,640
God damn!

2520
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:56,080
This is stupid!

2521
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:56,940
Is there...

2522
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,420
Is there V?

2523
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,620
I summoned V to talk to him.

2524
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,500
Wait, I can open the Wikipedia?

2525
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:03,940
What the fuck?

2526
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,840
Wait, the crow is like a Battle Pass shop!

2527
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,520
What the fuck?

2528
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:12,180
The crow is the fucking shop!

2529
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:14,300
Oh my god!

2530
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:18,620
Okay...

2531
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:20,460
He's still there!

2532
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:21,620
He's all the way there, guys!

2533
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,440
He's all the way there!

2534
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:28,300
I'm making shit, bro!

2535
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:29,920
I'm making shit!

2536
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,860
Are you still... Your house is still here!

2537
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,500
You haven't even moved it!

2538
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:35,920
What do you mean?

2539
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,100
I have!

2540
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:36,860
Wait, did you move it?

2541
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:37,660
Oh, you did!

2542
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:38,880
Oh shit!

2543
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,920
I can't believe it.

2544
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,080
I can't believe you moved away.

2545
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,240
It's so fucked up.

2546
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:45,420
What?

2547
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,200
Okay, build mode.

2548
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:50,280
I need to build a... I'm gonna stay... This is my area now.

2549
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,840
I'm not gonna move.

2550
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:53,640
What?

2551
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,080
Nah.

2552
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,020
You see my home?

2553
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:55,840
I think you'll move.

2554
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,180
No, that's fine.

2555
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,480
Cause you know we're not gonna play this on day two.

2556
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,380
I just wanna have a house.

2557
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:06,140
This is the only time I can have affordable housing.

2558
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,040
Houses was...

2559
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:11,940
Not like this.

2560
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:12,900
Alright.

2561
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,700
I'm fucking trying to get my copper in.

2562
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,160
At least it's free, guys.

2563
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:21,640
It was free.

2564
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,220
Okay, nice.

2565
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,300
Do I have enough?

2566
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,020
I don't know if I haven't...

2567
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,160
Okay, let's see.

2568
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:36,260
Alright.

2569
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,200
I'm thirsty?

2570
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:38,340
Am I?

2571
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:39,900
Oh shit, I am!

2572
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:41,640
Okay.

2573
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:42,680
Uh...

2574
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,200
I'm gonna need to eat and drink in this game.

2575
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:44,880
I forgot about that.

2576
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,600
Yeah, I know.

2577
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,360
I forgot about that.

2578
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:50,040
At least like the eating part is not like... You don't have to worry about the eating part a lot.

2579
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,160
I feel like.

2580
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:57,900
Uh... Cause like the eating... Your stomach doesn't go down as fast.

2581
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:00,260
Uh...

2582
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:01,860
I'm out of materials?

2583
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,160
They said I have enough!

2584
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:03,980
What the fuck?

2585
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,720
Who told you that?

2586
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,620
Guys, I got a battle pass plus one!

2587
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,240
Goddamn you, why?

2588
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,420
Why to me?

2589
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,780
I don't have enough?

2590
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:12,660
I like how...

2591
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:17,440
I like how whenever you craft something successfully, it gives you a plus battle pass.

2592
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,040
I still need two more coppers?

2593
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,100
Are you fucking kidding me?

2594
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:21,640
Okay.

2595
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,920
Alright, get all ten.

2596
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:25,740
Get in there.

2597
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:26,920
Alright.

2598
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,580
What happened to number six?

2599
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:30,620
I don't know.

2600
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,780
I don't know where number six is.

2601
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:32,120
He disappeared.

2602
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,480
Number six, give me a gun.

2603
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:37,760
That's not...

2604
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,420
I don't think number six...

2605
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,300
Give me a gun.

2606
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:44,080
Number six.

2607
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:47,520
Alright, let's see.

2608
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,820
I'mma chill here.

2609
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:53,480
I need to wait for my copper to... to construct.

2610
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,860
When does the multiplayer in this game kick in?

2611
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:57,480
Like I'm...

2612
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:04,800
That's what... That's what I'm curious about.

2613
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,400
When does the multiplayer kick in in this game?

2614
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:11,460
Alright.

2615
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,660
Got all my crafting...

2616
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:18,680
material.

2617
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,400
And then...

2618
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,720
Is there a gear workshop?

2619
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:25,540
Okay, finally.

2620
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,540
Finally, I have made the gear workshop.

2621
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:29,940
I only took...

2622
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,200
Oh my god!

2623
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:32,740
How do I make guns?

2624
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:34,860
Insufficient material?

2625
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,280
What kind of material do I need?

2626
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:39,560
What the f...

2627
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,320
What the f*** is all this?

2628
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,320
Oh my god.

2629
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:50,160
There is like a lot of materials you're supposed to gather to create a f***ing gun apparently.

2630
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,940
And build a supplies workshop?

2631
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,100
What is a supplies workshop?

2632
01:39:58,720 --> 01:39:59,880
What the f***?

2633
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:01,820
I need more copper.

2634
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,480
Everything is copper.

2635
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,840
Why are you pressing the right button?

2636
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,080
Because I'm making my own house.

2637
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:08,020
Okay, never mind.

2638
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:08,640
Number six.

2639
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,460
I need... Give me all your copper.

2640
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,980
I don't... I don't need guns anymore.

2641
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,280
I just want copper.

2642
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:20,980
There's an alligator in front of my house.

2643
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,020
There's an alligator?

2644
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:23,320
Kill him for material!

2645
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:24,480
Ow!

2646
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,300
Kill him for materials!

2647
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:28,240
Oh f***.

2648
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:29,860
Okay.

2649
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:30,780
I'm gonna...

2650
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,560
Cut this tree.

2651
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:33,840
Oh my god, the tree grew back.

2652
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:34,480
Nice.

2653
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,680
That's what I needed.

2654
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,620
I needed more trees.

2655
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:40,960
Hey, it stopped raining.

2656
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:44,040
I don't understand.

2657
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,240
Remember like people were... the mixed reviews.

2658
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:50,340
People were complaining about how there's too many people queuing up for this game.

2659
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:52,200
And I'm like... What?

2660
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:55,100
Just pick different servers.

2661
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:55,900
Come on.

2662
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,200
Alright, let's see.

2663
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,820
I think this game could be fun if...

2664
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:05,460
There you go.

2665
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:10,740
If it's like with people that... You know, if I made like a Dragoon server, it could be fun as well.

2666
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:12,820
But like...

2667
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:13,380
I have a house.

2668
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:16,340
You should come to my house.

2669
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:17,420
Alright, give me a sec.

2670
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,680
I'm crafting right now.

2671
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:22,180
You should... You should... You should...

2672
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,820
I got in my chat.

2673
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,560
I was like, no it wouldn't.

2674
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:25,080
Stop coping.

2675
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:26,600
Come to my house.

2676
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,700
It could be, guys!

2677
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,140
Okay, I'm coming over to your house.

2678
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,300
I have affordable housing.

2679
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:36,780
Where are you?

2680
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,600
Where the fuck do you live now?

2681
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,400
Oh, there you are.

2682
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,280
I'm not... I'm not...

2683
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:43,200
Guys, I need to figure out some way to get handouts here.

2684
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:48,260
Yep.

2685
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:48,920
Hells yeah.

2686
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:49,940
Alright, here I come.

2687
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,340
We haven't found a single person with a car yet.

2688
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,380
Wait, where do you live?

2689
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:57,560
Is this your house?

2690
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,040
This is my home.

2691
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:59,300
You built that?

2692
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:00,720
I didn't.

2693
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:01,120
It's my house.

2694
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:01,940
It came with a blueprint.

2695
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:04,120
Wait, what the fuck?

2696
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,620
Did you build this?

2697
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:07,720
It came with a blueprint.

2698
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:11,380
Did you steal somebody's house or did you literally just build this yourself?

2699
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,920
I literally just built this.

2700
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,360
How did you get this?

2701
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,900
What the fuck?

2702
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,500
How did you get the house?

2703
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,000
Affordable housing.

2704
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,440
Where did you get this?

2705
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,760
What do you mean where did I get this?

2706
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,780
I got the material.

2707
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:28,420
This is it.

2708
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:30,880
Where did you get the blueprint for this?

2709
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,440
There's a blueprint.

2710
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:34,100
It comes with a blueprint.

2711
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:35,140
We have it.

2712
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:35,460
Which blueprint?

2713
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:36,280
What?

2714
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:37,640
Yeah.

2715
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,140
Okay, wait.

2716
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,440
Wait a minute.

2717
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,960
Just press V and then right click.

2718
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:43,780
Okay.

2719
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:47,760
Then it's like on the right, house blueprints and then there's presets for it apparently.

2720
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:48,740
What the fuck?

2721
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,920
And then I saw, I was like, I saw exquisite villa and I was like, oh shit.

2722
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,280
Oh my god, wait you.

2723
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,600
What the fuck?

2724
01:42:58,760 --> 01:42:59,500
How do we?

2725
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,240
Wait, how do I?

2726
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,740
I made this.

2727
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,920
I made this.

2728
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,680
This is here.

2729
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,220
Wait, what the fuck?

2730
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:10,880
Wait.

2731
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:13,340
What?

2732
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:18,040
Oh my god, you can actually build a house?

2733
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:19,360
Yeah.

2734
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,200
Oh my god.

2735
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:24,960
Alright guys, well now I know.

2736
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:27,700
Okay.

2737
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,100
Yeah.

2738
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:29,460
I'm sorry man.

2739
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,660
This is just a madly urge.

2740
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:31,800
This is time.

2741
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:33,100
I need affordable housing.

2742
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:37,040
I can't believe they hid this from us.

2743
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,900
I need his free real estate.

2744
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,020
Now I need, now I need a house too.

2745
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,240
Now you need a house, huh?

2746
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,860
Oh man.

2747
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,780
Wait, I want the truck house.

2748
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:58,080
How do I get the truck house?

2749
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,340
I think you need a truck though.

2750
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,300
You need a truck for a truck house?

2751
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:05,040
It doesn't give me a, it doesn't give me the truck.

2752
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,860
There's like three different garage.

2753
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:10,180
That's fucked up that the truck isn't included.

2754
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:11,500
I just, yeah.

2755
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,820
I can't believe it.

2756
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,960
Why is the truck not included?

2757
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:21,020
I don't know.

2758
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:23,220
It should be included.

2759
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:25,540
Water filters, solar generators.

2760
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:26,540
I have the materials.

2761
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,280
Honestly, this game seems fun.

2762
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,280
But I just, everything is just overwhelmed.

2763
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:30,980
All right.

2764
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,180
Well, I know where I want to live.

2765
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:35,360
Where's the permissions?

2766
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:36,340
Prime's permissions.

2767
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,480
Access to .

2768
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:40,460
The structure cannot be built near a road?

2769
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,460
What do you mean near a road?

2770
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:42,760
Yeah, exactly.

2771
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:47,220
That's why, that's why I'm trying to find some flattery areas.

2772
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,020
All right.

2773
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:48,620
That's it.

2774
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:49,020
I'm moving.

2775
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,020
It's moving time.

2776
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:51,520
Yeah, I know, right?

2777
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:52,880
I fucking knew it.

2778
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:53,700
You bitch.

2779
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,720
That's why I moved as well.

2780
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:56,800
It's so annoying.

2781
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,580
You didn't tell me.

2782
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,740
You did not give me any context.

2783
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:00,560
No, no, no, no, no.

2784
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,800
You said nothing.

2785
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,580
It's a surprise.

2786
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:04,240
I made a house.

2787
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,340
You said nothing.

2788
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:09,060
Of course, I've been like, I don't want to move.

2789
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:12,840
If I knew, if I knew you couldn't...

2790
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:19,940
How did you, how did you, did you like, did you like, disassemble, demolish everything?

2791
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,040
Or like...

2792
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,340
I, it's like B and then Z.

2793
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,140
B and Z?

2794
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,600
B and Z and Z to move territory, you just have to walk over an area.

2795
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:32,140
Oh my God, what the fuck?

2796
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:33,740
Yeah.

2797
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:35,080
Does chat teach you?

2798
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:41,220
Your, more people play, more people on your stream play this game.

2799
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:43,480
Compared to my stream.

2800
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:45,480
Honestly, I don't know.

2801
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,940
Yeah, my chat's like, I don't know what to do.

2802
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:51,680
Look, man.

2803
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,920
This is Southeast Asia.

2804
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,820
We play anything that's free.

2805
01:45:58,540 --> 01:45:59,560
I swear.

2806
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:04,200
Okay, let's see.

2807
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:10,420
Relocation has a 10 minute cooldown.

2808
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,080
Yeah, that's fine.

2809
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,700
I'm fine with that.

2810
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:14,540
Alright, it's time.

2811
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:18,360
Let's see.

2812
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,040
Build.

2813
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:24,180
How do I still not be able to build this house?

2814
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,640
Yeah, it's annoying, right?

2815
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:27,360
God damn.

2816
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,320
Wait, wait, I found it.

2817
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:31,220
Why don't you make the shack?

2818
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:32,900
No, no, no, I found it.

2819
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,000
You found it?

2820
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:36,500
I found a place.

2821
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,020
What are you building?

2822
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:38,820
I found it.

2823
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,820
Are you building a tower house?

2824
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,900
Are you building a tower house?

2825
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:47,040
Are you building a tower house?

2826
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,160
Oh no.

2827
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:49,800
Holy shit.

2828
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,420
Little John sits in the corner.

2829
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:53,720
I'm building now.

2830
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:57,720
You know, that house reminds me of those...

2831
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:58,680
You know those memes?

2832
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,260
Galvanized square beach.

2833
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:03,300
No!

2834
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:05,760
Why can't I build...

2835
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,360
Where's the fastest way to do this?

2836
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,000
I wish it's instant.

2837
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,520
I have to move and look every fucking corner.

2838
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,040
Are you fucking kidding me?

2839
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:16,160
But I think there's flight.

2840
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:16,960
There's flight.

2841
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,740
How the fuck do I...

2842
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:20,260
There's flight.

2843
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:21,580
The flight cameras.

2844
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:23,540
On the left.

2845
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:25,220
Let me fucking...

2846
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:26,700
Oh my god, do I have to like...

2847
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,340
deconstruct this?

2848
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:30,700
No.

2849
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,320
It won't let me keep building.

2850
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:36,660
No, the six won't help build.

2851
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:38,220
Did I fuck it up?

2852
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,420
Oh no, I cancelled it.

2853
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,200
Do I have to redo this?

2854
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:42,380
Oh no, I don't.

2855
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:45,180
It exceeds territory range?

2856
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,880
What do you mean it exceeds territory range?

2857
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:49,600
There's like a white border.

2858
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:51,820
Oh my god!

2859
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:53,980
I have to move my house closer.

2860
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:55,660
Did you build it outside?

2861
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:56,400
Did you build it outside?

2862
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,480
I didn't know either!

2863
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:03,000
This is stupid.

2864
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:04,140
This game is so clunky.

2865
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:07,840
Wait, why can't I build my door?

2866
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:10,300
The door is in the territory!

2867
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:13,260
What do you mean it exceeds territory?

2868
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,300
It's literally in the territory!

2869
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:16,640
It's literally in the territory!

2870
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,180
How does it exceed it?

2871
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:19,140
I mean...

2872
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:21,380
If I look at the fucking square...

2873
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:24,640
Some parts of your building is outside.

2874
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:28,420
How does it exceed it?

2875
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:29,200
I don't understand!

2876
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:31,820
I'm gonna cut more trees.

2877
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:37,700
I need to move the territory better.

2878
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:38,360
Please!

2879
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,620
I need my tower house!

2880
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:46,500
I'm killing a whole deer family here.

2881
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,540
I'm cutting...

2882
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:48,780
I'm destroying the environment.

2883
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,300
Fuck the trees.

2884
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,360
We don't have any trees.

2885
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:52,120
We don't need oxygen.

2886
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:53,740
We need a house.

2887
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:57,560
The house is more important.

2888
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:58,340
I wouldn't worry about that.

2889
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,760
Affordable housing is more important here.

2890
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,320
Exactly.

2891
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,020
Would you rather die in a nice home...

2892
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:07,780
or just die in the fucking street?

2893
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,260
I would rather die in a nice home.

2894
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:11,560
I want a house.

2895
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,760
That's all I want.

2896
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:17,620
We didn't even care about the game anymore.

2897
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:18,360
We didn't even care about the game anymore.

2898
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:19,220
We just want to build.

2899
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,140
How do I have insufficient...

2900
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:23,540
I have 300 fucking...

2901
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,480
wood!

2902
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:27,460
Well, you need like...

2903
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,240
a thousand four hundred...

2904
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,340
Yeah, but I still have the wood!

2905
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,440
I still have it though!

2906
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,200
I don't know about that.

2907
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:37,280
Can I help you build?

2908
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:38,760
Yeah, can you help me?

2909
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,160
You don't have permission.

2910
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:41,720
Wait, how do I give you permission?

2911
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:45,200
You go to Hive and then click my name.

2912
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:46,820
Okay, give me a sec.

2913
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:49,480
I'm fucking moving my house a little bit better here.

2914
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:50,620
Okay.

2915
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,080
How do I...

2916
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,660
Yeah, you go to Hive...

2917
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:58,060
Give me a sec.

2918
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,660
I've left my territory.

2919
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:01,160
There's like permission...

2920
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:01,780
Okay.

2921
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:03,320
There you go.

2922
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,300
No, I have to wait!

2923
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:07,020
Okay, go to Hive and then...

2924
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:07,980
Uh...

2925
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,540
Hive... Okay, wait, I need to...

2926
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:12,580
This is the hardest game ever.

2927
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:15,440
Yep.

2928
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,460
Okay, what do I do?

2929
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:20,420
Go to Hive and then what?

2930
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:21,740
Click my name.

2931
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:22,180
Yeah?

2932
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:23,640
And then what?

2933
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:24,580
And then there's like friends permission?

2934
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,640
No, I can delete... Oh, there it is.

2935
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:27,960
Okay.

2936
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,980
Enable, enable, enable.

2937
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,720
You can use it to store stuff too.

2938
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:34,700
Okay, let's see.

2939
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:35,580
Can I build stuff?

2940
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,180
Okay, build!

2941
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,160
Build my home!

2942
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:41,740
Yeah...

2943
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,020
There's the door!

2944
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:44,240
The door!

2945
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,240
Wait, how did you build the door?

2946
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:47,900
Wait, how did you build the door?

2947
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:48,980
That's your fucking door.

2948
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,160
Holy shit, that's so funny.

2949
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,020
How could you do that and I couldn't?

2950
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:55,440
Holy shit, that's funny.

2951
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:58,800
How were you able to do it?

2952
01:50:58,880 --> 01:50:59,600
But I can't.

2953
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,440
You have a door that's unreachable.

2954
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,240
Congratulations.

2955
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:04,980
I have an unreachable door?

2956
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:05,740
No, I can't.

2957
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,160
Look, see?

2958
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:07,140
Hello.

2959
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:12,940
Yeah, you can go out, but you can't.

2960
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:14,220
You can't come out.

2961
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:16,640
Wait, wait.

2962
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:17,520
This is an issue.

2963
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,340
This is an issue because we can't...

2964
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:24,740
We can't go up into the house.

2965
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:25,360
Oh shit.

2966
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,920
You can climb.

2967
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:29,420
We know you can't.

2968
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,160
Can you climb?

2969
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:35,080
Yeah, but then the door has to always be open or we can't unlock the door.

2970
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:36,560
Yeah, well...

2971
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,880
That's not a problem.

2972
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:41,780
Yeah, you know what?

2973
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:43,300
This is a problem.

2974
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:45,300
This is the safest home.

2975
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,880
In the most fucking RPG survival.

2976
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:49,960
We have to unlock the door here.

2977
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:52,460
And then go up like this.

2978
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:54,720
Yeah, no one can raid it.

2979
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:56,820
Yeah, nobody can raid my house.

2980
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:00,400
No one can raid your house if you close the door and just log out there.

2981
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:02,160
Just no one can go there.

2982
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:05,320
Alright, nice.

2983
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:06,840
We're so good at this game.

2984
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,320
Okay, okay.

2985
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:14,080
I have like six more minutes before I can...

2986
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,820
I'm gonna go crash at your house.

2987
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:17,760
Let's see.

2988
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:19,360
We don't even have beds.

2989
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,620
It's so fucked up.

2990
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:25,160
Yeah, furniture is just a concept to me.

2991
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:25,660
Yeah.

2992
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:28,460
We are just an empty house.

2993
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,860
Yeah, my house is gonna be taller than your house.

2994
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,280
Yeah, three floors.

2995
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:33,960
Yeah.

2996
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:37,660
We haven't bumped into like a single boss type yet.

2997
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,480
We've just been building a house.

2998
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:41,300
This is so much fun.

2999
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:42,280
This is more important chat.

3000
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:44,320
This is a lot more important.

3001
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:46,600
Remember, affordable housing.

3002
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,920
This is so much more important guys.

3003
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:49,960
You don't understand.

3004
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,000
Okay, let me see.

3005
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:54,540
You guys wouldn't understand guys.

3006
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:56,100
They wouldn't get it.

3007
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:57,020
You wouldn't get it.

3008
01:52:57,540 --> 01:53:00,900
This is like the most important part in the video game.

3009
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:02,740
Trying to figure out like...

3010
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:04,620
Which place...

3011
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:06,780
Can like guarantee...

3012
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:09,520
That my house is like...

3013
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,460
Uh...

3014
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:13,340
Is like okay.

3015
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:15,880
Is like okay.

3016
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:16,820
Is like... I don't know.

3017
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,960
I've been trying to find stuff.

3018
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:21,380
But then I found out my house area is like...

3019
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:22,960
Swarmed with alligators.

3020
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:23,780
So I'm like...

3021
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:25,200
Yeah, but what are alligators gonna do?

3022
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:26,500
They're gonna do nothing.

3023
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:30,980
I haven't seen a single alligator that's like near you yet.

3024
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,240
It was there.

3025
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,840
So many of them.

3026
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,860
Did you kill all of them?

3027
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:39,380
Probably.

3028
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:42,500
Yeah, right here.

3029
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:44,140
I just saw it.

3030
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:45,080
Wait, really?

3031
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:46,100
I'm sorry.

3032
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:48,060
I'm trying to figure out my house still.

3033
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,860
It is a fucking alligator.

3034
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:51,720
Holy shit.

3035
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,460
I'm trying to figure out how to...

3036
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:56,080
Where can I put this?

3037
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:01,180
Where can I put...

3038
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:05,170
There's nothing.

3039
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:07,510
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3040
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:07,670
Here.

3041
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:09,590
Oh my god.

3042
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:12,150
Oh my god.

3043
01:54:12,290 --> 01:54:12,730
Okay.

3044
01:54:14,010 --> 01:54:14,510
No.

3045
01:54:16,170 --> 01:54:16,730
What?

3046
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:17,550
There.

3047
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:19,550
I have a minute still?

3048
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:21,050
Okay, I gotta wait here.

3049
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:23,590
I gotta wait here.

3050
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:26,490
I didn't realize the top right corner is my cooldown.

3051
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:28,590
Oh my god.

3052
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:32,870
But honestly...

3053
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:34,950
The game's not bad.

3054
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:36,050
It's just...

3055
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:36,930
Yeah, look.

3056
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:40,850
Okay, the moment we finish building our houses, we'll actually fight for real.

3057
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:41,730
Right.

3058
01:54:45,010 --> 01:54:46,130
We'll fight.

3059
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:47,810
We'll fight stuff.

3060
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:48,870
We need a home first.

3061
01:54:49,370 --> 01:54:51,570
This is the end game, basically.

3062
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:52,730
We're speedrunning this game.

3063
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:55,090
Exactly.

3064
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:56,690
Guys, this is like...

3065
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:58,570
We just wanted to find a house first.

3066
01:54:58,690 --> 01:55:01,330
This is much more important than fighting.

3067
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:02,490
Than shooting our guns.

3068
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:03,610
Okay, guys.

3069
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:07,970
Like, I don't care if those are nice gear.

3070
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:10,290
They have nice house.

3071
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:10,830
They have nice house.

3072
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:11,810
I surely do.

3073
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:13,510
Okay.

3074
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:15,330
Oh my god, one minute left.

3075
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:18,450
One minute left and then I can finally put down my house.

3076
01:55:19,170 --> 01:55:21,130
Oh, it's cause I'm moving my...

3077
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:24,270
I'm moving my tower at the same time?

3078
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:26,850
Is that... Oh my god!

3079
01:55:27,910 --> 01:55:28,870
That's why...

3080
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:30,870
That's why I was struggling.

3081
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:33,250
Cause I was moving my tower.

3082
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:35,230
How do I move just this?

3083
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:36,290
Dude, dude.

3084
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:38,330
Just demolish it.

3085
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:38,830
No!

3086
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:41,810
Get rid of the blue frame.

3087
01:55:41,970 --> 01:55:42,230
No!

3088
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:43,130
Never!

3089
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:45,150
I'm too lazy!

3090
01:55:46,550 --> 01:55:48,250
I'm too lazy!

3091
01:55:49,490 --> 01:55:50,630
Isn't that all of us?

3092
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:53,090
I don't wanna move my thing.

3093
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:54,690
It's too much work.

3094
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:58,210
I don't wanna move.

3095
01:56:02,570 --> 01:56:05,310
I have to demolish the house!

3096
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:07,450
I'm sad.

3097
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:09,730
I have to demolish the house.

3098
01:56:09,810 --> 01:56:10,650
Goodbye, door.

3099
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:12,630
Goodbye.

3100
01:56:13,690 --> 01:56:15,590
You were a great door.

3101
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:17,630
You were a great door.

3102
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:19,350
Did you get rid of the blue frames?

3103
01:56:19,610 --> 01:56:20,030
Alright.

3104
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:21,410
The blue frame is still there.

3105
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:22,210
No fucking way.

3106
01:56:22,390 --> 01:56:23,130
Wait, is it?

3107
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:23,990
There's no way.

3108
01:56:24,950 --> 01:56:25,970
There's no way.

3109
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:26,770
No, it's not.

3110
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:28,550
The blue frame is still there.

3111
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:29,250
No, it's not.

3112
01:56:29,370 --> 01:56:30,350
I don't see it.

3113
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:32,630
Wait, it is!

3114
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:34,830
What the fuck is it still doing there?

3115
01:56:35,210 --> 01:56:37,070
How do I demolish the blue frame?

3116
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:38,950
Here's the hollow terminal.

3117
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:40,830
Wait, how do I get rid of the blue frame?

3118
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:41,290
How do I get rid of it?

3119
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:43,470
Weird ass camera.

3120
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:45,310
There's nothing I can do.

3121
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:47,390
How do I get rid of it?

3122
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:49,250
Oh, cancel.

3123
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:49,730
Okay.

3124
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:50,590
Nice.

3125
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:50,830
Alright.

3126
01:56:51,070 --> 01:56:51,810
There you go.

3127
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:52,450
It's gone.

3128
01:56:53,110 --> 01:56:53,630
Nice.

3129
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:53,910
Alright.

3130
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:55,270
Now I can move this.

3131
01:56:56,330 --> 01:56:58,530
Number 6 is just gathering resources.

3132
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:03,810
Okay, I need to fucking do my stupid tower.

3133
01:57:05,350 --> 01:57:06,050
Okay, here.

3134
01:57:07,310 --> 01:57:08,130
Maybe here.

3135
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:09,970
Whose house is this?

3136
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:12,370
Oh, this is number 6.

3137
01:57:12,970 --> 01:57:14,190
Alright, confirmed.

3138
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:15,050
He has a bed!

3139
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:16,530
Number 6 has a fucking bed!

3140
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:18,630
Number 6 has a bed?!

3141
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:20,630
How did he progress that far?

3142
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:23,950
I feel relaxed.

3143
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:24,750
Alright.

3144
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:26,630
This bed is very nice.

3145
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:28,410
Guys, we will get there.

3146
01:57:28,570 --> 01:57:30,750
The tower is gonna be made.

3147
01:57:31,710 --> 01:57:32,310
Okay.

3148
01:57:33,010 --> 01:57:33,610
Alright.

3149
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:34,890
I'm figuring this out.

3150
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:35,690
Very slowly.

3151
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:36,930
Okay.

3152
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:38,370
My tower.

3153
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:39,830
There's still hope.

3154
01:57:39,870 --> 01:57:41,890
Just don't put it over the edge of the territory.

3155
01:57:42,190 --> 01:57:43,110
Bro, what the fuck?

3156
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:45,010
How do I not do that?

3157
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:48,310
When you press B, there's like a white...

3158
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:49,410
like a white square.

3159
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:52,790
Bro, it's so hard to make this stupid.

3160
01:57:53,130 --> 01:57:53,630
I'm... fuck.

3161
01:57:53,730 --> 01:57:53,890
I'm...

3162
01:57:53,890 --> 01:57:54,630
I'm going insane.

3163
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:55,390
I'm gonna demolish everything.

3164
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:55,870
Fuck this.

3165
01:57:56,010 --> 01:57:56,410
I'm gonna...

3166
01:57:58,510 --> 01:57:59,470
I'm going crazy.

3167
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:00,710
I'm gonna demolish everything.

3168
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:01,150
I...

3169
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:03,110
I did that.

3170
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:03,970
I did that.

3171
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:05,030
I fucking fucked up.

3172
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,590
I'm going crazy.

3173
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:06,530
I'm going...

3174
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:09,450
I already went through that phase.

3175
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:10,070
So...

3176
01:58:11,410 --> 01:58:12,370
Fuck this.

3177
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,830
I don't need this.

3178
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:16,930
I don't need this at all.

3179
01:58:19,210 --> 01:58:20,350
Like, you know.

3180
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:22,190
Alright.

3181
01:58:23,410 --> 01:58:25,710
This tower is much more important.

3182
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:27,670
You move it.

3183
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:28,670
Do it.

3184
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:28,970
Okay.

3185
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:29,910
Alright.

3186
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:32,630
There we go.

3187
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:35,350
Where's the... where's the...

3188
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:36,250
I don't know.

3189
01:58:36,410 --> 01:58:37,430
I can't put my...

3190
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:38,410
What can I...

3191
01:58:39,550 --> 01:58:40,910
Overlaps with battle unit?

3192
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:43,410
What the fuck is the battle unit?

3193
01:58:44,030 --> 01:58:46,490
I honestly don't know what a battle unit is.

3194
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:46,850
Okay.

3195
01:58:46,850 --> 01:58:47,330
There we go.

3196
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:48,530
There we go.

3197
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:49,070
I did it guys.

3198
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:50,210
I did it.

3199
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:50,630
Oh, you did it.

3200
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:51,390
No way.

3201
01:58:51,530 --> 01:58:52,370
We did it.

3202
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:53,010
Let's go build.

3203
01:58:54,130 --> 01:58:55,430
It's time to build.

3204
01:58:56,110 --> 01:58:57,770
Your door is so long.

3205
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:59,530
It's time to build.

3206
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:00,490
Build your door.

3207
01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:01,010
Build your door.

3208
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:03,130
Oh my god.

3209
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:03,770
We did it.

3210
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:07,550
Oh my god.

3211
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:08,610
I finally...

3212
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:10,710
We figured it out guys.

3213
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:14,570
Okay.

3214
01:59:14,570 --> 01:59:15,410
Oh shit.

3215
01:59:15,450 --> 01:59:16,050
I made a stairs.

3216
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:16,810
Oh my god.

3217
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:18,370
You made my stairs.

3218
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:20,330
Okay.

3219
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:22,330
We're gonna go up, up, up.

3220
01:59:23,110 --> 01:59:24,590
Building formula left.

3221
01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:25,290
The door works.

3222
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:26,870
Do I not have materials anymore?

3223
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:27,790
I can't tell.

3224
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:31,010
I can't tell when I stopped having materials.

3225
01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:34,690
Okay.

3226
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:36,070
Okay.

3227
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:36,650
Oh my god.

3228
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,850
The door is finally accessible.

3229
01:59:38,410 --> 01:59:42,150
We can finally like go through the door.

3230
01:59:42,830 --> 01:59:44,650
The door is actually functional now.

3231
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:45,650
Why is the door gone?

3232
01:59:45,930 --> 01:59:45,930
Oh my god.

3233
01:59:46,290 --> 01:59:48,230
I made the door and it's gone.

3234
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:48,970
Wait.

3235
01:59:48,990 --> 01:59:49,330
Is it?

3236
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:50,210
I took it away.

3237
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:52,290
Oh you took it away.

3238
01:59:52,370 --> 01:59:54,030
You took away the door that I gave you.

3239
01:59:54,150 --> 01:59:55,650
How do I put the door back?

3240
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:57,030
How do I put the door back?

3241
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:58,110
I put it back.

3242
01:59:58,590 --> 01:59:59,910
Just put it back.

3243
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:00,650
How?

3244
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:01,890
It's gone.

3245
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:03,850
Oh my god.

3246
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:05,630
You took the door that I gave you.

3247
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:06,770
The door is gone.

3248
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:07,950
Put it back.

3249
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:09,190
You put it back.

3250
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:11,270
What do you mean I have no material?

3251
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:12,490
Yeah.

3252
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:13,130
That's what I'm saying.

3253
02:00:13,230 --> 02:00:15,750
What does it mean when it says we don't have materials?

3254
02:00:16,650 --> 02:00:16,790
Yeah.

3255
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:17,910
Then we're out of materials.

3256
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:19,390
Then get some trees.

3257
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:19,670
But what materials?

3258
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:21,150
Get trees.

3259
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:22,570
It's a goddamn wood house.

3260
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:23,330
Okay.

3261
02:00:23,390 --> 02:00:24,470
I'm fucking chopping.

3262
02:00:26,270 --> 02:00:27,650
Guys, we have to keep building.

3263
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:29,310
Oh.

3264
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:31,490
We gotta give number six perms.

3265
02:00:31,950 --> 02:00:32,930
To chop trees.

3266
02:00:33,230 --> 02:00:33,670
Number six.

3267
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:34,370
Okay.

3268
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:38,090
Tell number six to join our guild.

3269
02:00:38,490 --> 02:00:39,330
You're the leader.

3270
02:00:39,950 --> 02:00:40,630
Oh yeah.

3271
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:42,450
Invite him to our guild.

3272
02:00:43,890 --> 02:00:44,510
Oh yeah.

3273
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:45,510
Get over here.

3274
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:46,090
Yeah.

3275
02:00:46,130 --> 02:00:46,830
Get over here.

3276
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:48,550
Get over here.

3277
02:00:48,650 --> 02:00:49,710
Let me just talk to you real quick.

3278
02:00:50,650 --> 02:00:51,450
Invite to hive.

3279
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:53,550
I invited you to hive, number six.

3280
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:53,990
Alright.

3281
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:54,030
Yeah.

3282
02:00:54,030 --> 02:00:54,870
Get in here.

3283
02:00:56,030 --> 02:00:58,450
Get in here and build my house.

3284
02:00:58,570 --> 02:00:59,330
Fortnite that shit.

3285
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:00,270
Fortnite that shit.

3286
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:00,670
Real quick.

3287
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:02,630
Build my house.

3288
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:04,250
Okay.

3289
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:06,570
Dude.

3290
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:07,690
Are you in the guild yet?

3291
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:08,610
Okay.

3292
02:01:08,650 --> 02:01:09,470
Number six.

3293
02:01:09,890 --> 02:01:12,410
And then... You gotta give him the permission.

3294
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:13,450
Okay.

3295
02:01:13,450 --> 02:01:13,450
Okay.

3296
02:01:13,450 --> 02:01:14,850
We have to be friends with him.

3297
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:15,850
Wait.

3298
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:16,950
We have to be friends with him?

3299
02:01:17,190 --> 02:01:18,030
I'm not sure.

3300
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:19,750
Do we have to be?

3301
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:21,370
I don't know.

3302
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:22,650
Okay.

3303
02:01:22,770 --> 02:01:24,850
I don't see the option to give him the shit.

3304
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:25,490
Alright.

3305
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:26,450
Number six.

3306
02:01:27,570 --> 02:01:30,250
But he's like in our... What's the point of being in our guild?

3307
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:31,790
We can't... I don't know.

3308
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:35,510
My friend says like in a guild but like yada yada.

3309
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:35,990
Alright.

3310
02:01:36,610 --> 02:01:39,110
You get the lucky opportunity.

3311
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:41,610
I'm gonna remove you after the stream.

3312
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:46,830
You're so evil.

3313
02:01:47,290 --> 02:01:48,390
You're so evil.

3314
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:51,090
For my house!

3315
02:01:51,210 --> 02:01:53,910
My house is very important to me.

3316
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:59,490
Build my house right now.

3317
02:01:59,690 --> 02:02:00,850
Number six.

3318
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:01,890
Alright.

3319
02:02:01,890 --> 02:02:02,670
Do what you gotta do.

3320
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:03,470
Holy shit.

3321
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:04,010
This guy.

3322
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:04,930
This guy is the man.

3323
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,890
Go build the house.

3324
02:02:06,990 --> 02:02:08,230
I will supervise.

3325
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:11,490
Is he gonna put a door back on?

3326
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:15,890
Oh my god.

3327
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:16,330
He's building.

3328
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:17,450
Look at him go.

3329
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:18,930
Oh my god.

3330
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:20,570
Look at him go.

3331
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:24,450
Why were we doing work when we could have had number six do all the work for us?

3332
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:26,050
He was collecting materials.

3333
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:27,890
Give me a door number six.

3334
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:28,610
Give me a door.

3335
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:29,650
We need a door.

3336
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:29,950
Yeah.

3337
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:30,890
What happened to our door?

3338
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:31,850
I actually took it off.

3339
02:02:31,890 --> 02:02:32,230
I don't know.

3340
02:02:32,230 --> 02:02:32,850
I'll put it back on.

3341
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:37,070
I gave you a door and you took it away.

3342
02:02:37,330 --> 02:02:37,530
I don't know.

3343
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:38,030
What happened to the door?

3344
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:40,650
Holy shit.

3345
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:42,450
Holy shit.

3346
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:44,110
What happened to my door?

3347
02:02:44,150 --> 02:02:46,470
I don't even know what happened.

3348
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:53,530
I took the door but where did I take it?

3349
02:02:56,550 --> 02:02:57,470
I don't know.

3350
02:02:57,810 --> 02:02:59,990
Like it's gone.

3351
02:03:00,410 --> 02:03:02,470
I can't even put it back on.

3352
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:03,910
I don't even know.

3353
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:07,170
Like it's gone.

3354
02:03:07,170 --> 02:03:07,650
Like it's gone.

3355
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:11,210
It doesn't tell me how to get my door back.

3356
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:14,590
Oh I accidentally destroyed the door.

3357
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:18,390
Guys we don't need a door.

3358
02:03:20,550 --> 02:03:22,390
In my inventory?

3359
02:03:23,870 --> 02:03:26,430
There's no doors in my inventory though.

3360
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:30,370
What happened to it?

3361
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:33,490
I don't understand what I did.

3362
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:36,910
Oh my god.

3363
02:03:37,030 --> 02:03:37,510
Oh my god.

3364
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:38,630
He has so much materials.

3365
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:39,690
What the fuck?

3366
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:40,590
Look at that.

3367
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:42,530
You have a house.

3368
02:03:43,290 --> 02:03:43,970
Not yet.

3369
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:44,990
I don't have a roof yet.

3370
02:03:45,610 --> 02:03:46,630
It's like 40...

3371
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:48,090
Well you have three floors.

3372
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:49,150
Does it fucking matter?

3373
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:52,050
Yes it does.

3374
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:57,450
I require my house to be the tallest out of everybody.

3375
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:00,390
So I can overcompensate.

3376
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:02,470
Overcompensate?

3377
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:05,490
Hey there's a guy here.

3378
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:08,610
Wait he has... he killed a deer.

3379
02:04:10,830 --> 02:04:12,370
Yo that guy's high level.

3380
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:14,030
He has a sniper.

3381
02:04:14,450 --> 02:04:16,250
He has to steal his deer.

3382
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:19,790
Oh my god this guy's gaming.

3383
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:24,050
He's like looking at our house.

3384
02:04:24,610 --> 02:04:25,650
Hey there man.

3385
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:29,170
He's like looking at what we are doing.

3386
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:32,430
He's actually progressing the game.

3387
02:04:33,930 --> 02:04:36,750
Yeah well we're technically are as well.

3388
02:04:36,970 --> 02:04:38,290
Just a different aspect.

3389
02:04:39,370 --> 02:04:41,850
What are we missing in our building?

3390
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:46,990
Just a little bit of a foundations and such.

3391
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:50,890
Well you have a you don't have a roof yet.

3392
02:04:51,170 --> 02:04:52,270
Yeah I don't have a roof yet.

3393
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:58,410
Alright while number six is building the rest of our house we should go find some monsters to kill.

3394
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:01,010
You wanna do a deadsville mission?

3395
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:02,570
Yeah let's go do a mission.

3396
02:05:04,070 --> 02:05:05,910
Number six can we leave this to you?

3397
02:05:05,950 --> 02:05:06,450
Is that okay?

3398
02:05:06,650 --> 02:05:07,610
No you don't ask.

3399
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:09,210
You don't have to ask them.

3400
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:11,990
It's expected.

3401
02:05:15,130 --> 02:05:16,410
It's like pal world.

3402
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:17,150
They're my pal.

3403
02:05:20,810 --> 02:05:21,850
He ocean.

3404
02:05:22,030 --> 02:05:23,030
He's the man.

3405
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:25,290
He's the man.

3406
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:27,630
He takes it to the man.

3407
02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:29,930
Okay do we teleport there?

3408
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:31,410
Wait which one?

3409
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:32,970
Deadsville.

3410
02:05:34,330 --> 02:05:34,810
Deadssville.

3411
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:35,630
Okay wait.

3412
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:37,950
Deadssville.

3413
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:39,390
Is it your mission?

3414
02:05:40,270 --> 02:05:41,430
Yeah uh huh.

3415
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:42,370
What is it?

3416
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:45,330
It's called welcome back?

3417
02:05:46,870 --> 02:05:48,850
Is there TP or do we have to walk there?

3418
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:50,230
Is there TP or do we have to walk there?

3419
02:05:50,230 --> 02:05:52,010
Recommended of teleporting they said.

3420
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:52,830
But I'm not sure.

3421
02:05:53,290 --> 02:05:54,050
Where is it?

3422
02:05:54,190 --> 02:05:54,590
You wanna walk?

3423
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:56,410
Just to see what the fuck is gonna happen?

3424
02:05:56,410 --> 02:05:56,790
Yeah let's go.

3425
02:05:57,010 --> 02:05:58,150
I'll follow you behind you.

3426
02:05:59,190 --> 02:05:59,670
One kilometer.

3427
02:05:59,870 --> 02:06:01,270
Are you not on the same mission?

3428
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:04,010
No cause I still have to fucking build.

3429
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:07,030
I haven't finished building yet.

3430
02:06:07,150 --> 02:06:07,630
Top left.

3431
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:09,070
What the fuck is your mission?

3432
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:12,130
Go build mode and build the gear workbench.

3433
02:06:12,370 --> 02:06:13,690
That's my mission.

3434
02:06:13,910 --> 02:06:16,310
I'm still at the gear workbench.

3435
02:06:16,570 --> 02:06:18,210
I'm gonna kill this deer cause I'm angry.

3436
02:06:19,410 --> 02:06:20,870
Build a workbench.

3437
02:06:21,230 --> 02:06:22,390
I don't wanna build.

3438
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:23,450
I'm tired of building.

3439
02:06:27,130 --> 02:06:27,690
I'm not building.

3440
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:29,210
I want to shoot stuff.

3441
02:06:30,090 --> 02:06:31,490
Yeah shoot stuff.

3442
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:32,010
Oh wait.

3443
02:06:32,070 --> 02:06:32,770
This is the wrong way.

3444
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:33,330
God damn.

3445
02:06:33,410 --> 02:06:34,030
Stupid roads.

3446
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:36,090
Alright.

3447
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:38,270
I don't have my butterfly to help us.

3448
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:39,930
Cause my butterfly is still...

3449
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:41,650
My butterfly is...

3450
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:42,190
You don't have a butterfly?

3451
02:06:42,490 --> 02:06:43,510
Your butterfly is crying.

3452
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:45,330
My butterfly was like...

3453
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:47,490
Like I had to disassemble my butterfly.

3454
02:06:47,630 --> 02:06:48,030
Remember?

3455
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:49,870
Uhhh.

3456
02:06:50,570 --> 02:06:51,970
You can use my building.

3457
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:53,550
No.

3458
02:06:53,550 --> 02:06:54,350
It's fine.

3459
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:55,810
I'm too lazy.

3460
02:06:56,330 --> 02:06:57,610
We don't need the butterfly!

3461
02:06:57,710 --> 02:06:58,610
We have your butterfly!

3462
02:07:00,010 --> 02:07:01,850
Oh, it's good to have two butterflies.

3463
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:03,010
What's over here?

3464
02:07:04,450 --> 02:07:05,530
It's a zombie.

3465
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:07,210
Well, it's literally a zombie!

3466
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:10,130
It's literally a zombie!

3467
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:11,930
It's literally a zombie.

3468
02:07:11,930 --> 02:07:12,670
So what?

3469
02:07:12,670 --> 02:07:13,010
Exactly.

3470
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:17,550
I missed.

3471
02:07:17,550 --> 02:07:20,470
Like the tutorial had cooler zombies.

3472
02:07:20,850 --> 02:07:24,030
This is like... the tutorial not even zombies.

3473
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:25,410
The tutorial had actual monsters.

3474
02:07:26,150 --> 02:07:27,630
These are just zombies.

3475
02:07:28,010 --> 02:07:32,750
Did you have a hard time fighting the tutorial box?

3476
02:07:33,110 --> 02:07:34,310
The tutorial box?

3477
02:07:34,610 --> 02:07:34,950
Oh yeah.

3478
02:07:35,010 --> 02:07:36,150
No, it was so easy.

3479
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:36,910
I was just like...

3480
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:42,350
The fucking boss was like, oh that was a tough fight.

3481
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:45,610
What do you mean?

3482
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:47,070
I didn't even get to do anything.

3483
02:07:47,070 --> 02:07:47,390
And he just stood there.

3484
02:07:47,550 --> 02:07:48,530
He just stood there.

3485
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:49,270
Yeah, he just stood.

3486
02:07:49,490 --> 02:07:52,030
And then your butterfly killed him.

3487
02:07:55,650 --> 02:07:56,210
Alright.

3488
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:57,490
I'm following you.

3489
02:07:58,150 --> 02:07:59,810
We're in Micah's...

3490
02:07:59,810 --> 02:08:00,210
Hey.

3491
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:01,470
Hey there.

3492
02:08:01,710 --> 02:08:01,990
Person.

3493
02:08:02,270 --> 02:08:02,790
Goodbye.

3494
02:08:04,090 --> 02:08:06,370
Pretty sure he just started playing this game too.

3495
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:08,090
He has nothing.

3496
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:12,570
Alright.

3497
02:08:12,570 --> 02:08:13,890
I'm right behind you.

3498
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:17,410
We should play Remnant next time.

3499
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:19,010
Sure.

3500
02:08:19,590 --> 02:08:21,350
I should not have played Remnant 2 yet.

3501
02:08:22,490 --> 02:08:24,510
I tried to, but I kept crashing.

3502
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:25,050
There's a second game?

3503
02:08:25,150 --> 02:08:25,830
I don't even know.

3504
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:26,890
Yeah.

3505
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:30,570
There's a second game, but I kept crashing, so I just stopped.

3506
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:35,110
Thing is, I might need a new graphics card and I'm trying to save up.

3507
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:36,950
If I keep buying games, I can't.

3508
02:08:36,950 --> 02:08:38,390
Yeah, but the Steam Cell.

3509
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:41,410
There's a Steam Cell right now.

3510
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:45,010
Yeah, what's the point of buying games when I can't even launch it?

3511
02:08:45,470 --> 02:08:47,390
Wait, can you not... not even... you don't know if you can launch it.

3512
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:48,670
Maybe they fixed it.

3513
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:49,590
I have a 20 series, man.

3514
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:51,150
Yeah, but maybe they fixed it.

3515
02:08:51,570 --> 02:08:52,730
Oh yeah, never mind.

3516
02:08:52,770 --> 02:08:53,890
My chat was like, no.

3517
02:08:54,090 --> 02:08:55,310
My chat was like, no.

3518
02:08:57,910 --> 02:08:59,490
They're like, no to you.

3519
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:02,670
No, I have a 20 series.

3520
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:04,150
What can I do with that, huh?

3521
02:09:05,790 --> 02:09:07,810
Alright, where the fuck is our boss?

3522
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:08,970
We wanna fight.

3523
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:12,230
Oh shit.

3524
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:16,170
Wait, he actually dropped... wait, he dropped something.

3525
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:17,590
Watch this.

3526
02:09:18,290 --> 02:09:19,090
What the fuck?

3527
02:09:19,290 --> 02:09:20,330
Wait, what did I do?

3528
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:21,570
What is that?

3529
02:09:21,950 --> 02:09:24,710
It's like a... you kill them and then he drops this.

3530
02:09:25,610 --> 02:09:26,350
What is that?

3531
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:27,890
It's like a... it's like a weapon.

3532
02:09:28,890 --> 02:09:29,770
Can you throw it?

3533
02:09:29,810 --> 02:09:30,410
I must be thirsty.

3534
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:31,890
Wait, oh there's him.

3535
02:09:32,190 --> 02:09:33,650
Wait, I wanna see if I can kill this guy.

3536
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:35,030
No, you can, but like...

3537
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:36,430
It also kills people.

3538
02:09:36,590 --> 02:09:38,030
Oh, it like beams them.

3539
02:09:39,410 --> 02:09:40,490
Gee... oh, what?

3540
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:42,270
That's a... that kills them.

3541
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:42,890
What the fuck?

3542
02:09:42,930 --> 02:09:43,290
Yeah.

3543
02:09:44,970 --> 02:09:45,330
Yeah.

3544
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:46,190
Wait, where did I drop it?

3545
02:09:46,950 --> 02:09:47,670
Oh, there it is.

3546
02:09:47,710 --> 02:09:48,210
You can try it.

3547
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:48,650
It's right here.

3548
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:49,990
What is this?

3549
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:51,190
It's right here.

3550
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:51,990
Do I just aim it?

3551
02:09:52,070 --> 02:09:53,670
Yeah, yeah, just aim it and then it beams.

3552
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:55,250
Yeah, but there's like a limited ammo.

3553
02:09:56,210 --> 02:09:57,110
Oh, hell nah.

3554
02:09:57,170 --> 02:09:57,850
I'm not using this.

3555
02:09:58,110 --> 02:09:59,350
I have photosensitivity.

3556
02:09:59,350 --> 02:10:00,150
You want me to use that?

3557
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:00,510
Crazy.

3558
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:01,590
Alright, I'm gonna do it.

3559
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:03,770
I'm gonna use it.

3560
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:06,150
It's RGB time.

3561
02:10:07,950 --> 02:10:09,150
I gotta wear sunglasses.

3562
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:13,170
Where even... where's your fucking mission?

3563
02:10:13,170 --> 02:10:14,110
Oh, there's him again.

3564
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:15,910
There's another one of those.

3565
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:20,090
Oh my god, I'm so slow with this though.

3566
02:10:20,770 --> 02:10:22,810
I'm gonna use it on the actual boss boss.

3567
02:10:25,430 --> 02:10:27,250
There's like a lot of items around us.

3568
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:28,450
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

3569
02:10:28,450 --> 02:10:29,230
He's beaming me.

3570
02:10:29,630 --> 02:10:30,470
He's beaming me.

3571
02:10:30,630 --> 02:10:31,570
I beamed him back.

3572
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:34,610
I think it's like a rare drop.

3573
02:10:35,530 --> 02:10:38,370
No, it's like a rare drop type deal.

3574
02:10:38,490 --> 02:10:39,570
It'll just drop it.

3575
02:10:39,590 --> 02:10:39,910
Probably.

3576
02:10:41,010 --> 02:10:43,150
Where the fuck is your mission, Tenjin?

3577
02:10:43,170 --> 02:10:44,970
It's called Welcome Back.

3578
02:10:45,390 --> 02:10:46,930
Yeah, but where is it?

3579
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:48,470
It's very far.

3580
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:49,490
Told you.

3581
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:49,970
Oh my god.

3582
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:52,270
Wait, this is not even the area?

3583
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:53,410
No.

3584
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:58,070
Okay, I'm fucking... okay, I'm fucking running over to you.

3585
02:10:58,170 --> 02:11:00,990
I thought that was the area so I picked it up.

3586
02:11:00,990 --> 02:11:01,810
No, it was not.

3587
02:11:03,870 --> 02:11:05,090
Alright, here I come.

3588
02:11:06,350 --> 02:11:07,610
Was there stamina?

3589
02:11:08,470 --> 02:11:09,830
Where's the stamina bar?

3590
02:11:10,530 --> 02:11:11,650
Like, right there.

3591
02:11:11,670 --> 02:11:11,970
The muscle.

3592
02:11:11,970 --> 02:11:12,770
Oh, the muscle.

3593
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:13,110
Okay.

3594
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:13,630
Okay, I see it.

3595
02:11:13,650 --> 02:11:14,490
I see it now.

3596
02:11:14,910 --> 02:11:16,290
You gotta eat and drink.

3597
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:17,870
Yeah, it's okay.

3598
02:11:17,950 --> 02:11:19,970
I feel like we have enough food on us, right?

3599
02:11:21,010 --> 02:11:21,490
Right.

3600
02:11:21,910 --> 02:11:23,450
Yeah, I have like seven...

3601
02:11:23,450 --> 02:11:24,910
Actually, we lost no damage boost.

3602
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:29,570
I have like seven things from the tutorial.

3603
02:11:32,710 --> 02:11:33,190
Tutorial?

3604
02:11:33,510 --> 02:11:35,530
Yeah, the tutorial gave you so much free food.

3605
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:37,730
What the f- when did you have a gun?

3606
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,870
What?

3607
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:42,210
Since that lady gave me the blueprint.

3608
02:11:42,510 --> 02:11:43,090
That's why you're hungry.

3609
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:44,450
Oh!

3610
02:11:44,790 --> 02:11:47,510
I was not paying attention.

3611
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:48,970
You did not.

3612
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:50,730
You did not have a gun.

3613
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:55,330
I was too busy building my tower.

3614
02:11:58,990 --> 02:11:59,590
Right.

3615
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:01,690
You should be the area.

3616
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:02,790
This is okay.

3617
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:07,290
I have a bottle of soju.

3618
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:07,750
What is that?

3619
02:12:08,070 --> 02:12:10,010
I'm gonna fucking eat too.

3620
02:12:10,010 --> 02:12:10,950
I run so fast now.

3621
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:12,230
I run fast.

3622
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:13,890
Oh, you drank alcohol?

3623
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:15,110
Yeah.

3624
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:19,690
There's a... there's one of the... there's a player here.

3625
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:22,170
Yeah, there's a lot of players here.

3626
02:12:22,990 --> 02:12:24,970
Wait, is this... oh, this is like a town.

3627
02:12:25,710 --> 02:12:26,190
Yeah.

3628
02:12:26,590 --> 02:12:28,670
Oh, it's like a safe zone.

3629
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:30,530
Yeah, it is.

3630
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:31,950
We should have built... we should have lived here.

3631
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:34,950
We should have lived near here.

3632
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:37,030
Yeah, we should have lived near here.

3633
02:12:37,030 --> 02:12:37,790
Speak to Mary.

3634
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:41,090
Oh, wait, we got compensation!

3635
02:12:42,090 --> 02:12:43,610
Oh, my God!

3636
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:44,930
Compensation?

3637
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:45,210
Where?

3638
02:12:45,310 --> 02:12:46,410
Yeah, look at the mailbox.

3639
02:12:46,650 --> 02:12:47,590
They gave us free stuff.

3640
02:12:50,570 --> 02:12:51,130
Oh.

3641
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:53,210
Oh, my God!

3642
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:53,230
I got something.

3643
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:53,350
Sorry.

3644
02:12:53,570 --> 02:12:54,130
Yay!

3645
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:57,290
They fucked up so we get free stuff!

3646
02:12:58,510 --> 02:12:59,630
Buy something.

3647
02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:00,350
You have something.

3648
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:02,290
We have butterfly die.

3649
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:04,370
We have... you can now create...

3650
02:13:04,370 --> 02:13:07,590
Based on... we have originally opened up functionality for multiple character creation.

3651
02:13:07,770 --> 02:13:10,470
You can now create characters on any server.

3652
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:11,570
Whoa!

3653
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:15,150
All right.

3654
02:13:17,110 --> 02:13:17,670
Yay!

3655
02:13:19,930 --> 02:13:21,290
We got free stuff.

3656
02:13:21,550 --> 02:13:21,650
She's not selling anything.

3657
02:13:23,890 --> 02:13:24,730
Free loot!

3658
02:13:24,950 --> 02:13:26,790
I gotta talk to the lady.

3659
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:27,950
How do we open this loot box?

3660
02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:30,810
Teleport... oh, this is where we teleport to other worlds.

3661
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:31,730
Yay.

3662
02:13:33,670 --> 02:13:34,690
Is it this woman?

3663
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:38,230
That's a man.

3664
02:13:38,450 --> 02:13:39,430
Sorry, that's a man.

3665
02:13:40,090 --> 02:13:40,930
She's here.

3666
02:13:44,130 --> 02:13:44,650
Let's see what I...

3667
02:13:44,650 --> 02:13:45,590
Okay, let's see what I...

3668
02:13:45,590 --> 02:13:46,230
Investigate the teleportation...

3669
02:13:47,050 --> 02:13:48,190
Where's the loot box?

3670
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:50,650
Speak with traitor on site...

3671
02:13:50,650 --> 02:13:51,330
Oh, shit.

3672
02:13:51,530 --> 02:13:52,390
Loot box?

3673
02:13:52,610 --> 02:13:53,130
What the fuck?

3674
02:13:53,130 --> 02:13:53,150
Yeah.

3675
02:13:53,710 --> 02:13:55,390
What the fuck... there's a loot box?

3676
02:13:58,570 --> 02:13:59,610
I got...

3677
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:01,450
I got hairstyle.

3678
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:02,650
I got grenade.

3679
02:14:02,810 --> 02:14:04,530
I got emotes.

3680
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:05,730
I got cosmetic tokens.

3681
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:06,750
Okay.

3682
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:07,990
Yeah.

3683
02:14:08,030 --> 02:14:10,290
If you open the mailbox... did you not open the mailbox?

3684
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:12,650
There's a mailbox.

3685
02:14:12,650 --> 02:14:12,970
I'm not sure if I'm clear.

3686
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:17,070
What if I chat with her?

3687
02:14:17,230 --> 02:14:17,850
Do I...

3688
02:14:18,910 --> 02:14:20,750
Wait, she doesn't even have voice lines.

3689
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:23,890
We don't even have a voice line.

3690
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:27,450
Yeah, no, this random... the clear lady doesn't even have voice lines.

3691
02:14:28,030 --> 02:14:29,890
We both don't have a voice line.

3692
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:30,850
It feels awkward.

3693
02:14:30,990 --> 02:14:32,050
Yeah, this feels so weird.

3694
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:45,890
I don't even think I'm supposed to talk to her yet.

3695
02:14:45,890 --> 02:14:47,650
Because I don't have a mission.

3696
02:14:48,370 --> 02:14:48,850
Yeah.

3697
02:14:49,170 --> 02:14:50,750
I'm just gonna mooch off your missions.

3698
02:14:51,870 --> 02:14:53,470
What the fuck is that?

3699
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:55,510
What?

3700
02:14:55,930 --> 02:14:56,830
What is this?

3701
02:14:57,610 --> 02:14:58,630
What is that?

3702
02:14:59,730 --> 02:15:00,570
Where are you?

3703
02:15:00,610 --> 02:15:01,170
Is this a shop?

3704
02:15:01,370 --> 02:15:02,410
Who are you?

3705
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:03,570
Look at him.

3706
02:15:05,190 --> 02:15:07,710
Yeah, what the fuck is that?

3707
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:09,510
Shop.

3708
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:12,290
Oh, suppressors and stuff.

3709
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:13,750
Nice.

3710
02:15:16,050 --> 02:15:18,230
When will we fight our first boss?

3711
02:15:19,250 --> 02:15:20,310
I don't know.

3712
02:15:20,770 --> 02:15:21,470
Where do...

3713
02:15:21,470 --> 02:15:24,270
I think you have to find the bosses in the world.

3714
02:15:24,910 --> 02:15:25,950
Do we have to find it ourselves?

3715
02:15:26,510 --> 02:15:27,290
Alright, let's see.

3716
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:29,010
Recommend the shadow.

3717
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:30,170
Someone's over there.

3718
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:31,290
Let's go check it out.

3719
02:15:33,210 --> 02:15:34,010
Someone's up ahead.

3720
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:35,090
Let's go check it out.

3721
02:15:35,190 --> 02:15:36,730
Oh, there's like these exclamation points.

3722
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:38,470
Are those exclamation point bosses?

3723
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:40,370
You got a bike?

3724
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:43,710
Let's go to this nearest one.

3725
02:15:44,690 --> 02:15:45,330
This one.

3726
02:15:45,910 --> 02:15:47,230
The shadow lighthouse.

3727
02:15:50,470 --> 02:15:51,590
There's a fucking radio.

3728
02:15:52,430 --> 02:15:53,290
No shot.

3729
02:15:53,390 --> 02:15:54,190
They have a fucking radio.

3730
02:15:56,670 --> 02:15:57,890
What the fuck?

3731
02:15:57,930 --> 02:15:59,090
How did you get that bike?

3732
02:15:59,390 --> 02:16:00,030
Can you get on?

3733
02:16:00,230 --> 02:16:00,610
No.

3734
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:02,570
How did you get on it?

3735
02:16:04,350 --> 02:16:05,790
Can't you get on it?

3736
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:08,190
There's a fuel system.

3737
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:10,250
Did you talk to somebody to get it?

3738
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:11,210
Yeah.

3739
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:12,430
Do the missions.

3740
02:16:13,250 --> 02:16:14,170
Oh my god.

3741
02:16:16,070 --> 02:16:16,470
Okay.

3742
02:16:17,530 --> 02:16:19,270
Unlock the storage expansion.

3743
02:16:19,610 --> 02:16:21,210
How do I unlock the storage expansion?

3744
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:23,870
Don't do the red mission.

3745
02:16:23,990 --> 02:16:25,990
I think the red missions are like...

3746
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:26,910
The...

3747
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:28,610
The yellow is the green one.

3748
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:31,730
How do I unlock the storage expansion?

3749
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:34,530
I have the purple mission...

3750
02:16:34,530 --> 02:16:35,230
The yellow mission.

3751
02:16:36,290 --> 02:16:37,510
What the fuck is a purple mission?

3752
02:16:37,630 --> 02:16:38,510
I've never got a purple mission.

3753
02:16:38,530 --> 02:16:39,130
Okay, okay.

3754
02:16:39,210 --> 02:16:39,990
Give me a second...

3755
02:16:39,990 --> 02:16:42,330
I need to unlock the storage expansion.

3756
02:16:42,330 --> 02:16:45,570
Do I have enough storage expansion?

3757
02:16:46,050 --> 02:16:48,670
Where the fuck is the storage expansion?

3758
02:16:51,590 --> 02:16:53,070
Where is it?

3759
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:57,190
What the fuck?

3760
02:16:57,430 --> 02:16:58,510
Oh, is it basic storage?

3761
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:02,930
I need to unlock wooden support.

3762
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:03,570
Okay.

3763
02:17:04,130 --> 02:17:06,550
To get storage expansion.

3764
02:17:07,010 --> 02:17:07,730
Okay.

3765
02:17:07,950 --> 02:17:09,090
I did it.

3766
02:17:10,630 --> 02:17:12,830
Build any storage... Oh my god.

3767
02:17:12,910 --> 02:17:15,110
It needs me to build a storage crate.

3768
02:17:15,370 --> 02:17:17,530
How far ahead are you?

3769
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:19,610
Not that far.

3770
02:17:23,410 --> 02:17:25,290
Okay, can I TP to you or not?

3771
02:17:25,550 --> 02:17:26,210
I wonder.

3772
02:17:26,310 --> 02:17:27,410
Just TP to the base, no?

3773
02:17:27,710 --> 02:17:30,310
I know, but like, will I be able to TP to you later?

3774
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:32,810
Can you?

3775
02:17:33,030 --> 02:17:33,650
I'm not sure.

3776
02:17:34,110 --> 02:17:38,710
Alright, we'll figure this out the mo... I'm gonna TP to my home and see if I can TP to you.

3777
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:39,070
Just TP to the base.

3778
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:40,510
I'll TP to you.

3779
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:41,090
Just TP to you.

3780
02:17:41,090 --> 02:17:41,130
What?

3781
02:17:41,310 --> 02:17:42,410
Why are you going to me?

3782
02:17:42,810 --> 02:17:46,410
No, cause like, I need to go... cause you're there for the mission.

3783
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:47,690
To progress.

3784
02:17:48,190 --> 02:17:48,370
Why?

3785
02:17:48,630 --> 02:17:49,790
What do you mean?

3786
02:17:50,390 --> 02:17:52,190
What is 61% done?

3787
02:17:52,430 --> 02:17:53,670
Why did number 6 stop?

3788
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:59,050
Oh, it's cause he's still building.

3789
02:17:59,250 --> 02:18:00,190
Holy shit.

3790
02:18:00,190 --> 02:18:01,250
He's still building.

3791
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:04,450
I think I like, put too much stuff...

3792
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:05,850
Yeah.

3793
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:15,830
I definitely... I definitely picked the house too big.

3794
02:18:17,490 --> 02:18:18,910
Oh my god.

3795
02:18:19,110 --> 02:18:22,290
The house is definitely too big.

3796
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:24,310
It's too fucking huge.

3797
02:18:24,390 --> 02:18:26,470
Way more than mine, actually.

3798
02:18:26,930 --> 02:18:29,250
Oh shit, I taxed like the sky.

3799
02:18:29,390 --> 02:18:30,330
Oh, there it is.

3800
02:18:32,910 --> 02:18:33,630
Okay.

3801
02:18:34,470 --> 02:18:35,190
Uh...

3802
02:18:35,190 --> 02:18:38,990
Jesus Christ, there's so much stuff to unlock.

3803
02:18:41,850 --> 02:18:45,610
Oh my god, did you see someone chat that was like, I am Asian girl?

3804
02:18:46,250 --> 02:18:48,070
I didn't see that.

3805
02:18:49,790 --> 02:18:51,190
What the fuck?

3806
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:52,550
Insane.

3807
02:18:54,290 --> 02:18:55,910
Good to know, man.

3808
02:18:57,950 --> 02:18:59,870
What the fuck is furniture?

3809
02:19:00,110 --> 02:19:01,150
Basic furniture.

3810
02:19:02,470 --> 02:19:08,110
Oh, I couldn't build doors and windows because I never unlocked it.

3811
02:19:09,470 --> 02:19:09,990
Oh shit.

3812
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:09,990
Oh shit.

3813
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:10,670
Build a bed.

3814
02:19:10,690 --> 02:19:12,330
You never built a bed?

3815
02:19:13,550 --> 02:19:14,890
I never built a bed, no.

3816
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:17,030
How come I can't progress your mission?

3817
02:19:17,130 --> 02:19:17,530
What?

3818
02:19:18,590 --> 02:19:21,470
Because it's... I'm not doing the optional shit.

3819
02:19:22,730 --> 02:19:24,270
I don't have any other mission.

3820
02:19:24,350 --> 02:19:25,530
It just says build a bed.

3821
02:19:27,550 --> 02:19:29,110
Just look at your task.

3822
02:19:29,330 --> 02:19:30,510
What the fuck do you have?

3823
02:19:31,150 --> 02:19:32,250
Build a bed!

3824
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:37,430
Why did... I didn't even have... They didn't even tell me to like build a bed or some shit.

3825
02:19:37,590 --> 02:19:38,990
What happened to my missions?

3826
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:41,190
Why am I building a bed?

3827
02:19:41,650 --> 02:19:42,970
Why am I building...

3828
02:19:42,970 --> 02:19:44,870
Why do you have to build a bed?

3829
02:19:45,390 --> 02:19:45,910
Okay.

3830
02:19:47,050 --> 02:19:48,030
I don't know.

3831
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:48,890
I'm confused.

3832
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:52,050
I'm just as confused as you.

3833
02:19:53,830 --> 02:19:55,330
Why am I building...

3834
02:19:55,330 --> 02:19:55,430
What the fuck?

3835
02:19:57,410 --> 02:19:59,790
Am I supposed to follow the Stardust?

3836
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:00,410
Is that...

3837
02:20:00,410 --> 02:20:01,690
What your missions are?

3838
02:20:01,870 --> 02:20:01,870
Yeah.

3839
02:20:02,290 --> 02:20:04,270
Oh wait, untracked!

3840
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:07,870
Why did you untrack your main mission?

3841
02:20:08,430 --> 02:20:09,270
I don't fucking know how to...

3842
02:20:10,030 --> 02:20:10,590
Attention.

3843
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:14,990
I don't... I don't know 90% of what's going on right now.

3844
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:17,270
Me neither, dude.

3845
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:19,790
I just... I'm goofing.

3846
02:20:20,890 --> 02:20:23,010
Building gear workbench.

3847
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:25,450
Holy shit.

3848
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:26,770
Okay.

3849
02:20:27,770 --> 02:20:29,390
Gear workbench built.

3850
02:20:30,410 --> 02:20:32,370
Alright, what else does it want me to do?

3851
02:20:32,450 --> 02:20:33,690
Go to build a supplies...

3852
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:37,470
That... that is... he's... someone's name is I Like Asian Girls!

3853
02:20:40,570 --> 02:20:41,190
No!

3854
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:48,370
No!

3855
02:20:51,130 --> 02:20:52,470
Oh my god.

3856
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:54,410
Holy shit.

3857
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:55,690
Free to play games experience.

3858
02:20:55,690 --> 02:20:56,550
Oh my god.

3859
02:20:56,850 --> 02:20:57,470
No!

3860
02:20:58,450 --> 02:20:59,530
Oh my god.

3861
02:20:59,530 --> 02:21:01,050
Okay, basic gear.

3862
02:21:01,570 --> 02:21:03,090
We're getting there, guys.

3863
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:06,750
We're gonna be able to get there soon, guys.

3864
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:10,590
Give up this power through...

3865
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:14,790
I don't have enough ciphers?

3866
02:21:14,810 --> 02:21:17,090
What kind of worthless shit do I have?

3867
02:21:17,470 --> 02:21:19,370
Oh, I'm gonna reset this.

3868
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:21,610
That's my worthless shit that I had.

3869
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:23,550
Okay.

3870
02:21:23,550 --> 02:21:24,910
I got the gun.

3871
02:21:25,570 --> 02:21:27,590
It's time to craft the gun.

3872
02:21:31,990 --> 02:21:33,230
Which gun is it?

3873
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:35,570
Is it this one?

3874
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:37,950
The DE-50BP.

3875
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:38,830
It's the pistol.

3876
02:21:39,110 --> 02:21:40,870
DE-50P... Oh, okay.

3877
02:21:40,930 --> 02:21:41,390
It's this one.

3878
02:21:41,510 --> 02:21:42,710
I have insufficient materials?

3879
02:21:44,890 --> 02:21:46,450
Uh... collect the crafting materials.

3880
02:21:46,610 --> 02:21:47,210
The plus ones.

3881
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:49,450
I don't get it why they need to make that shit, but...

3882
02:21:51,830 --> 02:21:54,690
Explore the... Oh, I need to disassemble the scrap.

3883
02:21:55,410 --> 02:21:55,770
Oh...

3884
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:56,790
Yeah, disassemble the scrap.

3885
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:57,950
I have a disassembler.

3886
02:21:58,050 --> 02:21:59,310
Yeah, I'm just gonna use your dissembler.

3887
02:21:59,390 --> 02:22:00,850
Wait, did you give me perms to use your stuff?

3888
02:22:00,850 --> 02:22:01,810
Yeah.

3889
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:02,450
Okay.

3890
02:22:02,670 --> 02:22:04,370
Cause like last time you didn't have it.

3891
02:22:07,610 --> 02:22:08,130
Alright.

3892
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:15,030
Let's see.

3893
02:22:15,990 --> 02:22:19,090
It's like they're trying to combine a lot of stuff into one.

3894
02:22:19,450 --> 02:22:19,890
Yeah, yeah.

3895
02:22:19,890 --> 02:22:23,530
The base gun... and the grass and shit.

3896
02:22:23,650 --> 02:22:23,770
I agree.

3897
02:22:23,770 --> 02:22:24,710
Like, holy shit.

3898
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:26,750
It's like everything all at once.

3899
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:27,810
Yep.

3900
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:30,330
I'm gonna use your fucking gear shit too.

3901
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:31,870
Might as well.

3902
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:34,290
It's like right here!

3903
02:22:35,030 --> 02:22:35,710
Yeah, true.

3904
02:22:35,710 --> 02:22:37,030
How do I still don't have enough?

3905
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:39,510
What do you need?

3906
02:22:42,690 --> 02:22:43,110
Uhhhh...

3907
02:22:44,910 --> 02:22:45,510
Excuse me.

3908
02:22:47,350 --> 02:22:48,150
Oh, I got it.

3909
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:48,490
Never mind.

3910
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:49,730
JK, I just can't read.

3911
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:53,530
Yeah, well, honestly that's why I read it too.

3912
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:54,990
I got a gun.

3913
02:22:54,990 --> 02:22:55,230
I got a gun.

3914
02:22:55,470 --> 02:22:56,050
I did it.

3915
02:22:56,050 --> 02:22:56,890
I didn't assume so.

3916
02:22:57,230 --> 02:22:59,050
Craft any ammo in the supplies.

3917
02:22:59,050 --> 02:23:00,630
Wait, how much ammo did you craft?

3918
02:23:01,090 --> 02:23:02,630
Oh, you do have a fishing rod.

3919
02:23:03,850 --> 02:23:07,530
There's like a couple... there's like... hmm.

3920
02:23:09,210 --> 02:23:11,050
Oh, it's like 40 bullets?

3921
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:13,030
Holy shit.

3922
02:23:13,090 --> 02:23:13,610
It's like 40...

3923
02:23:13,610 --> 02:23:14,530
40 bullets for crafts.

3924
02:23:14,630 --> 02:23:15,690
Wait, what the fuck?

3925
02:23:15,750 --> 02:23:16,470
When did you get here?

3926
02:23:17,170 --> 02:23:17,830
I'm right.

3927
02:23:18,090 --> 02:23:18,850
This is my home.

3928
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:20,130
I have every right to be here.

3929
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:25,650
That's not what you're talking about.

3930
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:26,630
What?

3931
02:23:26,950 --> 02:23:27,710
That's insane.

3932
02:23:27,710 --> 02:23:29,230
She's kicking me out of my house.

3933
02:23:29,250 --> 02:23:30,370
Holy shit, how did you get here?

3934
02:23:31,990 --> 02:23:33,030
My house.

3935
02:23:33,950 --> 02:23:35,230
What the fuck?

3936
02:23:35,290 --> 02:23:36,070
That's insane.

3937
02:23:36,210 --> 02:23:37,570
She's kicking me out of my house.

3938
02:23:38,170 --> 02:23:41,250
I'm sorry, but... I mean, my house.

3939
02:23:41,610 --> 02:23:41,950
Can she do that?

3940
02:23:41,950 --> 02:23:43,890
Can she do that, chat?

3941
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:44,910
No way.

3942
02:23:45,770 --> 02:23:46,910
I just did.

3943
02:23:47,810 --> 02:23:49,270
She just did.

3944
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:50,710
Insane.

3945
02:23:50,770 --> 02:23:53,410
Can't believe we walked over here when we could just TP.

3946
02:23:54,910 --> 02:23:55,430
Yeah.

3947
02:23:56,470 --> 02:23:57,610
TP has cooled down.

3948
02:23:57,630 --> 02:23:57,690
I'm sorry.

3949
02:23:57,690 --> 02:23:58,610
Run now, wasted.

3950
02:23:58,830 --> 02:24:00,690
Wait, TP has cooled down?

3951
02:24:01,910 --> 02:24:02,350
Yeah.

3952
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:05,690
This was the quickest way to bring you here.

3953
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:11,090
These towers are even supposed to let you travel between worlds, but I haven't been able to figure out how.

3954
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:12,530
This building is half.

3955
02:24:12,730 --> 02:24:13,610
Can't build the stairs.

3956
02:24:14,190 --> 02:24:17,770
I'm glad that merchant over by the old truck looks like she gets around.

3957
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:18,630
Oh my God.

3958
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:19,790
When do I get my bike?

3959
02:24:20,450 --> 02:24:21,110
You got a program.

3960
02:24:21,810 --> 02:24:26,310
Apparently, the longer we follow the mission, the closer we get to the boss.

3961
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:27,670
I'm sorry.

3962
02:24:27,670 --> 02:24:29,630
I hope they're right.

3963
02:24:29,850 --> 02:24:30,530
I hope.

3964
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:34,570
Okay.

3965
02:24:35,770 --> 02:24:37,050
Yeah, we don't need to know that.

3966
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:38,270
We literally did that already.

3967
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:39,550
Okay, speak with the trader.

3968
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:42,450
You went there?

3969
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:42,890
You went there?

3970
02:24:43,090 --> 02:24:44,170
Yeah, I'm doing that.

3971
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:44,570
Oh, no.

3972
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:45,570
I'm doing the mission now.

3973
02:24:46,270 --> 02:24:47,250
Oh, you're at Dead'sville.

3974
02:24:48,850 --> 02:24:49,350
Oh, really?

3975
02:24:52,330 --> 02:24:53,130
Affordable housing.

3976
02:24:53,990 --> 02:24:54,590
Livable housing.

3977
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:55,470
I'm just looking.

3978
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:57,650
Where is the mission?

3979
02:24:59,010 --> 02:25:00,390
Oh, she's talking now.

3980
02:25:00,530 --> 02:25:01,310
Claire's talking.

3981
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:02,550
I know.

3982
02:25:06,010 --> 02:25:08,890
I like that so many people are naked in this game.

3983
02:25:09,050 --> 02:25:11,490
Yeah, nobody's bothering to put any armor on.

3984
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:12,170
They're just...

3985
02:25:14,210 --> 02:25:15,370
They're just building.

3986
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:21,430
Hey, everyone's just doing their shit.

3987
02:25:21,530 --> 02:25:23,030
And this guy's fully geared as shit.

3988
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:25,790
This guy's level 10 and not even wearing pants.

3989
02:25:26,670 --> 02:25:27,150
Jesus.

3990
02:25:27,150 --> 02:25:27,590
What level are we at?

3991
02:25:27,590 --> 02:25:27,650
We're at level 10.

3992
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:29,770
I'm level 6.

3993
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:31,050
Oh, okay.

3994
02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:33,090
So they just played like two more hours than us.

3995
02:25:33,990 --> 02:25:34,630
Yeah, probably.

3996
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:41,270
You got the bike now?

3997
02:25:41,550 --> 02:25:42,070
Oh, yeah.

3998
02:25:42,130 --> 02:25:42,790
I'm still talking.

3999
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:46,770
Oh, my God.

4000
02:25:46,770 --> 02:25:47,870
How many people did I have to talk to?

4001
02:25:53,450 --> 02:25:54,850
I can cut that trip.

4002
02:25:55,450 --> 02:25:56,530
It's very bad.

4003
02:25:56,830 --> 02:25:57,550
Oh, my God.

4004
02:25:57,550 --> 02:25:57,650
Oh, my God.

4005
02:25:57,670 --> 02:25:57,770
Good luck.

4006
02:25:58,410 --> 02:26:03,770
Oh, and I'll happily pay a reward if you can recover my stuff for me.

4007
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:05,650
I'll mark Rotten Manor on your map.

4008
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:08,170
Make sure to stock up on ammo before you go.

4009
02:26:08,350 --> 02:26:08,910
All right.

4010
02:26:09,070 --> 02:26:10,610
What the fuck gives you the bike?

4011
02:26:12,570 --> 02:26:13,330
This guy?

4012
02:26:13,610 --> 02:26:14,770
Oh, after that guy.

4013
02:26:14,930 --> 02:26:15,610
Oh, the guy?

4014
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:16,110
The low?

4015
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:17,390
Low guy?

4016
02:26:17,490 --> 02:26:17,770
Yeah.

4017
02:26:18,610 --> 02:26:19,750
After that guy.

4018
02:26:20,190 --> 02:26:22,750
The girl with the...

4019
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:23,590
801.

4020
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:23,910
Yeah.

4021
02:26:24,290 --> 02:26:24,810
801.

4022
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:25,630
801.

4023
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:25,850
801.

4024
02:26:25,850 --> 02:26:26,330
801.

4025
02:26:26,330 --> 02:26:26,370
801.

4026
02:26:26,530 --> 02:26:26,650
801.

4027
02:26:26,670 --> 02:26:27,190
801.

4028
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:27,650
801.

4029
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:29,270
Ada Wong gave the bike.

4030
02:26:30,350 --> 02:26:31,390
Claire Redfield.

4031
02:26:31,490 --> 02:26:32,250
Claire Wong.

4032
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:34,770
I like how this is like...

4033
02:26:35,650 --> 02:26:39,170
It's like cutscenes within the game so you can see people walking around.

4034
02:26:39,650 --> 02:26:40,530
Do you see me?

4035
02:26:41,330 --> 02:26:44,330
I think I just saw you walking around in my cutscene.

4036
02:26:45,170 --> 02:26:47,530
Can I... Do you still see this?

4037
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:48,270
Wait, wait.

4038
02:26:48,270 --> 02:26:49,810
I'm looking at him right now.

4039
02:26:49,850 --> 02:26:52,150
I don't have a POV of outside.

4040
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:56,630
You seek keys with which to unlock the dark tower.

4041
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:59,330
It's like the guy's talking to me.

4042
02:26:59,530 --> 02:27:01,610
I'm wary of what else you might open up.

4043
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:03,170
Do you always speak in red?

4044
02:27:03,170 --> 02:27:04,110
Now it's at 8.01.

4045
02:27:04,530 --> 02:27:06,690
I was merely setting the mood.

4046
02:27:07,250 --> 02:27:10,870
The world still deserves something poetic.

4047
02:27:11,330 --> 02:27:12,270
Oh man.

4048
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:14,150
What are you doing?

4049
02:27:15,290 --> 02:27:16,850
I'm emoting his...

4050
02:27:16,850 --> 02:27:20,870
I don't see you yet.

4051
02:27:21,470 --> 02:27:22,110
Don't.

4052
02:27:22,150 --> 02:27:22,350
Oh man.

4053
02:27:22,650 --> 02:27:24,710
Rift anchors across the wetlands.

4054
02:27:24,750 --> 02:27:25,750
It's a close up.

4055
02:27:26,270 --> 02:27:27,850
Those things are made by Rosetta.

4056
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:30,070
If you stand next to the campfire, I'll see you.

4057
02:27:30,450 --> 02:27:32,390
Access to the rift space inside the monolith.

4058
02:27:32,390 --> 02:27:32,870
I'm at the campfire.

4059
02:27:32,930 --> 02:27:33,210
Spot on.

4060
02:27:33,850 --> 02:27:34,990
And now tell me.

4061
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:37,610
Where do you think those anchors would be?

4062
02:27:37,930 --> 02:27:39,030
Wait, what?

4063
02:27:39,270 --> 02:27:40,190
No, you're not there!

4064
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:42,590
I'm at the campfire.

4065
02:27:43,590 --> 02:27:44,450
No, man.

4066
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:46,490
I'm looking forward to seeing what you can do, Mayfly.

4067
02:27:46,850 --> 02:27:49,950
I'm sure it will be a remarkable story to share.

4068
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:51,070
Hells yeah.

4069
02:27:51,070 --> 02:27:56,750
I feel bad for the people that wrote the story because they clearly put a lot of effort in writing this story.

4070
02:27:57,190 --> 02:27:57,350
Yes.

4071
02:28:00,370 --> 02:28:02,250
I had to talk to Mary again.

4072
02:28:02,370 --> 02:28:03,730
Mary, what do you want?

4073
02:28:05,670 --> 02:28:08,730
Now that we know what to do, let's split up to cover more ground.

4074
02:28:08,870 --> 02:28:10,510
I'll find a way to hack into the monolith.

4075
02:28:11,090 --> 02:28:13,410
I thought she had syringes of blood on her.

4076
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:16,270
Like, what is she doing with the syringes?

4077
02:28:17,870 --> 02:28:18,690
Who knows?

4078
02:28:19,570 --> 02:28:21,550
Gone for an hour and still no pants.

4079
02:28:21,630 --> 02:28:22,010
Yep.

4080
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:24,890
This game has no concept of pants.

4081
02:28:25,570 --> 02:28:27,210
Nobody wears pants here.

4082
02:28:27,390 --> 02:28:33,510
Like, I like the fact that the tutorial gave us armor, a hat, a glove, a shoe, but not a fucking pants.

4083
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:35,890
Yeah, it gave us everything but pants.

4084
02:28:35,910 --> 02:28:36,830
But a pants.

4085
02:28:37,310 --> 02:28:38,330
Holy shit.

4086
02:28:38,690 --> 02:28:40,050
What is wrong with the devs?

4087
02:28:40,050 --> 02:28:40,750
Look, there's P. Diddy.

4088
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:45,450
Hey there, guys.

4089
02:28:45,890 --> 02:28:46,710
P. Diddy?

4090
02:28:46,890 --> 02:28:47,810
A P. Diddy.

4091
02:28:47,810 --> 02:28:48,510
Oh, there it is!

4092
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:48,670
It's P. Diddy.

4093
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:48,870
It's a bike!

4094
02:28:48,930 --> 02:28:49,490
I got bike too!

4095
02:28:49,610 --> 02:28:50,150
I got bike too!

4096
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:50,710
Where's your bike?

4097
02:28:51,390 --> 02:28:51,430
Right.

4098
02:28:52,490 --> 02:28:53,450
I just drive it.

4099
02:28:53,530 --> 02:28:54,410
I can summon it.

4100
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:55,450
Wait, how do you summon it?

4101
02:28:55,930 --> 02:28:56,290
G.

4102
02:28:57,050 --> 02:28:57,410
G?

4103
02:28:58,330 --> 02:28:59,130
Oh, okay, okay.

4104
02:28:59,210 --> 02:29:00,010
It just taught me that.

4105
02:29:01,310 --> 02:29:01,670
Yeah.

4106
02:29:04,050 --> 02:29:04,410
Well...

4107
02:29:06,130 --> 02:29:08,790
We gotta go to Rotten Manor.

4108
02:29:10,090 --> 02:29:10,570
Yeah, alright.

4109
02:29:10,890 --> 02:29:11,610
Where's Rotten Manor?

4110
02:29:11,650 --> 02:29:12,070
Okay, here we go.

4111
02:29:16,930 --> 02:29:18,110
Fuck your bike.

4112
02:29:20,450 --> 02:29:21,930
Oh, fuck your bike.

4113
02:29:24,770 --> 02:29:25,370
No!

4114
02:29:25,770 --> 02:29:30,010
I was fucking over somebody else's bike.

4115
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:32,670
I'm ready.

4116
02:29:32,810 --> 02:29:33,290
Let's get...

4117
02:29:33,290 --> 02:29:34,670
I follow you.

4118
02:29:34,930 --> 02:29:35,790
Okay, okay.

4119
02:29:35,850 --> 02:29:38,630
Let's see what's the closest way to get there.

4120
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:40,050
What the fuck?

4121
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:43,870
I'm not even gonna ride down the road.

4122
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:45,450
Fuck the roads.

4123
02:29:46,290 --> 02:29:46,890
Okay.

4124
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:48,590
But there's horns.

4125
02:29:50,050 --> 02:29:50,530
Beep.

4126
02:29:50,730 --> 02:29:51,530
There's a radio.

4127
02:29:51,930 --> 02:29:52,530
Oh, yeah.

4128
02:29:54,090 --> 02:29:55,310
Is there actually radio?

4129
02:29:55,870 --> 02:29:56,350
Yeah.

4130
02:29:56,410 --> 02:29:57,130
Old X.

4131
02:29:58,790 --> 02:29:59,790
I don't know what...

4132
02:29:59,790 --> 02:30:00,570
Oh, there it is!

4133
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:07,240
Before exploring danger... Wait, what?

4134
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:09,240
Before exploring dangerous areas, press T?

4135
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:10,340
Oh!

4136
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:12,120
Make a camp.

4137
02:30:12,260 --> 02:30:13,640
We're fighting some shit.

4138
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:15,220
I don't know if I can join you.

4139
02:30:15,780 --> 02:30:17,080
Wait, can you not join me?

4140
02:30:17,580 --> 02:30:18,260
Where are you?

4141
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:18,440
I hope I can.

4142
02:30:18,440 --> 02:30:19,560
Can I see you?

4143
02:30:20,380 --> 02:30:21,080
Wait, wait, wait.

4144
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:22,540
You rode ahead of me.

4145
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:24,880
Can I go over this?

4146
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:26,440
No!

4147
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:28,200
Okay.

4148
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:30,280
I have to jump over this.

4149
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:32,340
I mean, you could summon your bike again.

4150
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:40,240
I love that we just materialized the fucking bike and that's it.

4151
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:40,480
No!

4152
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:42,200
Okay, there it is.

4153
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:45,920
Wait, what the fuck?

4154
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:48,240
Investigate.

4155
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:48,380
Investigate.

4156
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:49,480
Oh, you're gone.

4157
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:50,400
Holy shit.

4158
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:50,440
Oh shit!

4159
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:51,380
You're gone too!

4160
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:52,020
Oh!

4161
02:30:57,180 --> 02:30:57,620
Okay.

4162
02:30:57,760 --> 02:30:58,340
Oh no.

4163
02:30:58,400 --> 02:30:59,480
I should have brought the butterfly.

4164
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:01,160
I should have brought the butterfly.

4165
02:31:01,540 --> 02:31:02,560
I should have brought the...

4166
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:02,700
No, it's easy.

4167
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:03,400
Just shoot the head.

4168
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:03,860
Shoot the head.

4169
02:31:03,860 --> 02:31:04,380
Keep shooting the head.

4170
02:31:04,380 --> 02:31:05,000
I shot the head.

4171
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:08,280
I shot it with a goddamn butterfly.

4172
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:13,840
I definitely should have brought the butterfly.

4173
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:16,420
Holy fuck.

4174
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:20,320
I know that I fucking...

4175
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:20,360
I know that I fucking...

4176
02:31:20,360 --> 02:31:20,740
I'm fucked up.

4177
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:22,440
Wait, I don't even have...

4178
02:31:23,540 --> 02:31:24,360
Oh my god.

4179
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:25,360
I didn't bring my gun.

4180
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:26,500
Wait, I did bring my gun.

4181
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:26,780
Okay.

4182
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:30,700
I hear it growling at me outside.

4183
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:33,400
Okay.

4184
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:41,000
I realized that like when you're on the pause menu, you're not actually paused by the way.

4185
02:31:41,220 --> 02:31:41,600
No.

4186
02:31:42,460 --> 02:31:43,580
Yeah, it's an MMO.

4187
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:44,200
What did you say?

4188
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:46,260
I don't know.

4189
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:48,980
I expected to pause for a minute.

4190
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:50,600
Fuck.

4191
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:54,420
It's a solo anyway.

4192
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:56,400
That's true.

4193
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:01,060
Where's your head?

4194
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:03,840
What do you want?

4195
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:05,780
Where the fuck is the head?

4196
02:32:05,860 --> 02:32:06,680
It's so tiny.

4197
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:08,960
There we go.

4198
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:09,420
I killed it.

4199
02:32:10,660 --> 02:32:11,480
Jesus Christ.

4200
02:32:11,880 --> 02:32:12,060
There it is.

4201
02:32:12,200 --> 02:32:13,400
The Rift Anchor.

4202
02:32:14,140 --> 02:32:15,440
Let's take a closer look.

4203
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:18,520
The Rift Anchor?

4204
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:20,340
I'm just gonna lay back, enjoy my coffee, and...

4205
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:21,400
You're already finished?

4206
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:23,280
Yeah, I did that.

4207
02:32:23,540 --> 02:32:24,200
Oh shit.

4208
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:26,120
I'm gonna cutscene it.

4209
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:26,700
Oh wait, hey, hey.

4210
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:29,040
Oh, P Diddy's here.

4211
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:30,960
Where's your... Okay, there you are.

4212
02:32:32,480 --> 02:32:33,480
P Diddy's gone.

4213
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:36,860
How do we do like the bosses together then?

4214
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:39,020
You gotta find it.

4215
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:42,900
A lot of people are fighting in some places I heard.

4216
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:44,000
Oh, okay.

4217
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:47,320
Alright.

4218
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:48,620
You lead us.

4219
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:50,340
You seen that more than once.

4220
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:51,180
You have more knowledge than me.

4221
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:51,780
You lead us.

4222
02:32:53,240 --> 02:32:56,340
I can't read the chat, but people keep saying, boss, boss, boss.

4223
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:57,540
Boss, boss, boss.

4224
02:32:57,720 --> 02:32:58,740
You do... Come on, where is it?

4225
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:00,660
Tangents chat!

4226
02:33:00,700 --> 02:33:01,380
Where's the boss?

4227
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:03,620
No, not the chat.

4228
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:04,980
Like the game chat.

4229
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:05,900
Oh!

4230
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:09,220
Like everyone keeps saying boss, boss, boss, and I'm like, hmm.

4231
02:33:09,860 --> 02:33:13,280
Someone said we can do dungeons together.

4232
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:15,200
Where's the dungeons?

4233
02:33:15,460 --> 02:33:16,060
Where's the dungeons?

4234
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:17,280
Which one's the dungeons?

4235
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:18,200
Yeah.

4236
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:19,980
That's what I like to know.

4237
02:33:20,480 --> 02:33:22,480
Which one would be the dungeons then?

4238
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:24,400
I'm curious now.

4239
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:27,960
Like, what do dungeons even look like?

4240
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:30,780
Wait, am I getting shot at?

4241
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:32,140
Oh, shit.

4242
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:32,480
We are.

4243
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:35,640
We're just looking at her map.

4244
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:36,700
We're looking at the maps.

4245
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:39,080
There's a guy right behind us.

4246
02:33:42,690 --> 02:33:45,670
We're like, where could the dungeons be?

4247
02:33:46,010 --> 02:33:46,590
Pfft.

4248
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:50,500
We have to do these?

4249
02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:52,180
The welcome back?

4250
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:56,860
Oh, we do the dungeon after this quest.

4251
02:33:57,100 --> 02:33:57,320
Okay.

4252
02:33:57,380 --> 02:33:59,020
We have to go to the other ones.

4253
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:00,840
And then we can do the dungeons.

4254
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:02,360
Okay.

4255
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:03,100
Where are you headed?

4256
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:05,380
I guess we can do the closest one to us.

4257
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:06,240
Like this one?

4258
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:06,980
341?

4259
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:07,340
Sure.

4260
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:08,220
Oh, shit.

4261
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:09,460
What the fuck did you...

4262
02:34:09,460 --> 02:34:10,820
What did you do to my bike?

4263
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:12,100
Why?

4264
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:13,180
You pushed me over.

4265
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:14,720
You pushed me over first!

4266
02:34:14,820 --> 02:34:16,280
You pushed me over too.

4267
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:17,660
We need to unlock...

4268
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:19,380
Unlock the rift anchors.

4269
02:34:19,380 --> 02:34:19,760
Okay.

4270
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:21,020
Apparently with the...

4271
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:21,960
Oh, there's dogs!

4272
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:24,480
There's like demon dogs.

4273
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:27,920
Diamond dogs?

4274
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:29,000
Yeah.

4275
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,600
There was a demon dog in front of me.

4276
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:33,860
I wish we can go like faster with the...

4277
02:34:33,860 --> 02:34:34,320
Yeah.

4278
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:36,720
The bikes.

4279
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:38,040
There you go.

4280
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:38,580
Activate.

4281
02:34:38,600 --> 02:34:38,900
Okay.

4282
02:34:39,260 --> 02:34:39,920
Activate that.

4283
02:34:40,040 --> 02:34:41,880
This is not my bike.

4284
02:34:43,580 --> 02:34:44,060
Activate...

4285
02:34:44,060 --> 02:34:44,920
Wait.

4286
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:45,740
There's so many bikes.

4287
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:46,580
Whose bikes are it?

4288
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:48,940
Where's the guy on...

4289
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:49,080
I don't know.

4290
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:50,840
Why is there a random bike here?

4291
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:51,700
Whose bike is that?

4292
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:54,300
I wouldn't know of it.

4293
02:34:55,220 --> 02:34:55,740
Okay.

4294
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:58,400
Next one is... Where's the next one?

4295
02:34:58,820 --> 02:35:00,060
What the fuck is that?

4296
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:01,500
What is that?

4297
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:01,700
What?

4298
02:35:02,060 --> 02:35:02,980
What the fuck?

4299
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:03,920
Is that the boss?

4300
02:35:04,580 --> 02:35:06,080
Oh my god!

4301
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:07,240
Affordable housing!

4302
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:09,800
Is that the... Is that where everybody's going?

4303
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:11,400
I think everybody's going there.

4304
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:11,900
Holy shit.

4305
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:13,360
Holy shit.

4306
02:35:13,460 --> 02:35:14,480
Are we fighting that thing?

4307
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:15,440
Wait.

4308
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:16,440
Is everybody there?

4309
02:35:16,980 --> 02:35:18,000
What is that?

4310
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Can we get close to it?

4311
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Wait.

4312
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:18,580
There's nobody here.

4313
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:20,280
Can we get close to it?

4314
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:21,020
I'm getting close...

4315
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:22,280
What the fuck happened?

4316
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:22,860
Oh shit.

4317
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:23,440
Oh shit.

4318
02:35:23,640 --> 02:35:24,540
What is that?

4319
02:35:24,580 --> 02:35:25,140
I'm going to shoot it.

4320
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:26,700
No.

4321
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:28,440
No.

4322
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:29,520
You can't even shoot it.

4323
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:31,340
What is that then?

4324
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:31,640
Wait.

4325
02:35:31,640 --> 02:35:32,380
Can I shoot the hands?

4326
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:33,840
What is this?

4327
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:34,240
Wait.

4328
02:35:34,580 --> 02:35:35,980
You can't even shoot it.

4329
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:38,200
Shit.

4330
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:39,580
Wait.

4331
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:41,900
The friend?

4332
02:35:42,180 --> 02:35:43,520
It talked to me.

4333
02:35:43,780 --> 02:35:44,240
Wait.

4334
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:44,940
Did it talk to you?

4335
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:45,080
What did you do?

4336
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:46,660
He talked to me.

4337
02:35:46,820 --> 02:35:48,160
Oh, it didn't talk to me.

4338
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:49,360
I shot it.

4339
02:35:52,140 --> 02:35:52,740
He's friend?

4340
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:54,120
What the fuck is that?

4341
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:54,880
I think he's friend.

4342
02:35:55,100 --> 02:35:55,560
He's friend?

4343
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:55,900
Oh my.

4344
02:35:56,060 --> 02:35:58,100
I mean, I mean, he doesn't have a mouth.

4345
02:35:58,120 --> 02:35:58,780
Could be a friend.

4346
02:35:58,820 --> 02:35:59,900
Yeah, how did he talk to you?

4347
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:01,240
I don't know.

4348
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:02,440
What does it do?

4349
02:36:03,860 --> 02:36:05,100
I honestly don't know.

4350
02:36:06,240 --> 02:36:07,320
I don't know what this is.

4351
02:36:07,560 --> 02:36:09,900
I wonder if like we can get on top of it later.

4352
02:36:10,080 --> 02:36:10,260
Okay.

4353
02:36:10,540 --> 02:36:12,120
Something stares at the mural on the ground.

4354
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:13,700
Crush the murals and find a hidden miniature.

4355
02:36:14,460 --> 02:36:14,920
Oh, I see.

4356
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:16,680
Oh, I see it.

4357
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:16,820
Oh.

4358
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:21,280
Hail moving house, not even a moving house.

4359
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:22,260
Everybody's confused.

4360
02:36:22,580 --> 02:36:23,400
Everybody's shooting.

4361
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:26,140
I don't know.

4362
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:27,520
I don't know.

4363
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:28,040
You know what?

4364
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:29,900
I will not mess with the Mystical Forest.

4365
02:36:29,980 --> 02:36:39,380
Apparently, people are saying that we have to find a way to access the secret for this.

4366
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:40,660
It's apparently a secret.

4367
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:41,800
Ooh.

4368
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:44,020
All right.

4369
02:36:44,060 --> 02:36:44,800
There are faint noises.

4370
02:36:44,820 --> 02:36:44,900
It's your turn.

4371
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:52,100
When did we do that?

4372
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:16,920
We did it guys!

4373
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:19,280
We did it!

4374
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:20,940
We got a disco!

4375
02:37:21,180 --> 02:37:22,380
We leached!

4376
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:23,040
Let's go!

4377
02:37:24,060 --> 02:37:24,760
Wait what?

4378
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:27,360
What the fuck did they do?

4379
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:30,080
Rewards can only be claimed once a week.

4380
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:31,300
Please come back next week.

4381
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:32,760
I'm not going to come back.

4382
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:35,520
When did we even get it?

4383
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:37,800
That's a nice stuff.

4384
02:37:38,940 --> 02:37:40,240
I got a disco!

4385
02:37:40,460 --> 02:37:40,760
Woo!

4386
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:42,640
Yeah I got a disco ball.

4387
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:43,800
I don't know what that does.

4388
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:44,880
I don't know what it does.

4389
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:46,140
But we did it.

4390
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:47,300
Yeah!

4391
02:37:47,460 --> 02:37:49,700
How the fuck did they do it?

4392
02:37:49,960 --> 02:37:51,320
I don't know.

4393
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:54,400
Where's the leech?

4394
02:37:54,520 --> 02:37:55,760
Where are the leeches?

4395
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:59,280
It's just like Diablo all over again.

4396
02:38:03,610 --> 02:38:06,580
Wait it like became part of the environment.

4397
02:38:11,060 --> 02:38:12,580
Wait the hell is...

4398
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:16,940
We got the shit.

4399
02:38:17,220 --> 02:38:18,040
Oh my god.

4400
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:19,440
I can't believe it.

4401
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:20,740
Unlocked house treasure and then leave this place.

4402
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:21,640
Well I'm leaving it.

4403
02:38:22,140 --> 02:38:23,540
Yeah I'm leaving it too.

4404
02:38:23,820 --> 02:38:24,260
Ow.

4405
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:27,060
Okay I need to get my bike too.

4406
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:28,520
We gotta go to the other unlock.

4407
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:30,340
Yay!

4408
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:31,820
We did it Tanger!

4409
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:33,040
We got a disco ball!

4410
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:33,980
Yeah we did it.

4411
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:34,320
Hell yeah.

4412
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:35,560
Yay!

4413
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:36,160
Leech!

4414
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:38,080
I don't know why we needed a disco ball.

4415
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,420
But it's good to have.

4416
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:44,080
Oh shit.

4417
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:44,660
Whoops.

4418
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:46,880
Alright.

4419
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:49,460
I... I fucked up.

4420
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:50,460
Give me a sec.

4421
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:53,420
I got off the road and I fucked up.

4422
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:55,520
I'm going off the road.

4423
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:56,120
Okay.

4424
02:38:56,740 --> 02:38:57,820
I'm heading over now.

4425
02:38:59,320 --> 02:39:00,740
I left my loot there.

4426
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:01,740
It's alright.

4427
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:03,200
I got the disco ball though.

4428
02:39:07,540 --> 02:39:08,500
Holy shit.

4429
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:09,720
This game's physics is funny.

4430
02:39:10,180 --> 02:39:12,180
I'm just happy with the disco ball.

4431
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:14,000
Apparently I only took one thing.

4432
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:15,960
Seriously?

4433
02:39:16,620 --> 02:39:17,460
It's alright.

4434
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:20,700
I'm probably just having the disco ball.

4435
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:24,060
I don't even know what other stuff was there.

4436
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:27,180
I just like claimed the disco ball.

4437
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:30,600
Oh shit.

4438
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:36,080
Okay I got the... got the rift.

4439
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:38,100
Yeah I'm heading for this one too.

4440
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:39,860
Where's the other one?

4441
02:39:39,980 --> 02:39:40,840
Where's the last one?

4442
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:42,520
It's next to our base.

4443
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:44,760
It is?

4444
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:47,180
We might as well just fast travel if it's next to our base.

4445
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:48,160
Sure.

4446
02:39:48,500 --> 02:39:49,260
I'm fast traveling.

4447
02:39:51,880 --> 02:39:52,320
Woo.

4448
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:52,960
Yeah.

4449
02:39:56,100 --> 02:39:56,540
Yeah.

4450
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:57,300
Holy shit.

4451
02:39:57,420 --> 02:39:58,240
Yeah I still don't get it.

4452
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:00,560
They just decided not to give us pants.

4453
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,140
I'm gonna check my disco ball.

4454
02:40:03,700 --> 02:40:04,580
What is it?

4455
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:06,340
What does it do?

4456
02:40:06,700 --> 02:40:07,440
What does it do?

4457
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:09,280
I have no clue.

4458
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:10,000
Oh it's a deviation!

4459
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:15,620
So I can have a disco ball in my...

4460
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:18,460
I can have a disco ball in my backpack?

4461
02:40:19,660 --> 02:40:20,580
Is that it?

4462
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:23,540
I see about that.

4463
02:40:23,900 --> 02:40:24,540
Alright I'm gonna check.

4464
02:40:25,080 --> 02:40:26,880
Number 6 is still going at it.

4465
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:27,820
Go number 6!

4466
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:28,120
Go!

4467
02:40:30,260 --> 02:40:32,420
I'm... you're 72%!

4468
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:36,140
Who would... who will win?

4469
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,680
Us fighting a boss?

4470
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:39,880
Or number 6 building this house?

4471
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:44,040
Who will win?

4472
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:46,100
It's a crafting... it's a crafting shit.

4473
02:40:46,180 --> 02:40:46,740
Not a combat.

4474
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:47,900
It's a different thing.

4475
02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:49,640
But it says a deviation!

4476
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:52,620
I know but it's like a crafting stuff.

4477
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:57,640
So I can't put it in my... I can't put it in my... in my backpack?

4478
02:40:58,900 --> 02:40:59,740
Hold on.

4479
02:41:00,020 --> 02:41:01,540
Oh somebody broke its leg.

4480
02:41:01,940 --> 02:41:03,060
No you can't.

4481
02:41:04,660 --> 02:41:05,240
Nooooo!

4482
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:06,420
What's the point?

4483
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:08,740
It's not a combat!

4484
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:09,660
Deviation!

4485
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:10,360
Nooooo!

4486
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:11,640
What's the point?

4487
02:41:12,620 --> 02:41:14,380
It's not a combat deviation!

4488
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:17,040
There's an alligator in my door!

4489
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:18,800
What the fuck?

4490
02:41:19,100 --> 02:41:19,820
It's in!

4491
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:21,960
What?

4492
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:24,000
Wait wait wait wait what?

4493
02:41:24,320 --> 02:41:26,800
There's an alligator in my fucking door.

4494
02:41:26,980 --> 02:41:27,380
Holy shit.

4495
02:41:27,380 --> 02:41:28,520
The disco ball's in!

4496
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:30,220
I put the disco ball!

4497
02:41:30,580 --> 02:41:32,060
It's not in my backpack but...

4498
02:41:32,060 --> 02:41:34,500
But it's there.

4499
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:35,360
It's in!

4500
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:38,740
That looks enough.

4501
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:40,240
That looks so dumb.

4502
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:42,500
That's all that matters!

4503
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:44,700
This is the only thing...

4504
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:47,800
This is the only thing I looted!

4505
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:49,660
Holy shit.

4506
02:41:49,820 --> 02:41:52,340
But I got the disco ball.

4507
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:54,740
Holy shit.

4508
02:41:54,760 --> 02:41:58,440
I don't need the butterfly just with the disco ball.

4509
02:42:02,480 --> 02:42:04,000
Oh my god!

4510
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:05,260
I got it!

4511
02:42:06,500 --> 02:42:07,900
It's super dumb.

4512
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:11,260
I'm gonna go to the last...

4513
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:12,660
Wait which way is it?

4514
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:13,300
The last one.

4515
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:14,260
It's over here.

4516
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:15,340
That way.

4517
02:42:17,660 --> 02:42:19,280
Hell yeah, my motorcycle.

4518
02:42:19,700 --> 02:42:20,760
Even though...

4519
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:22,720
Oh my god guys we can't...

4520
02:42:22,720 --> 02:42:25,180
Wait you like drove over it.

4521
02:42:26,740 --> 02:42:27,860
Even though...

4522
02:42:27,860 --> 02:42:29,100
Oh my god broke my leg.

4523
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:31,020
You broke your leg.

4524
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:34,260
Even though it can't be in my backpack...

4525
02:42:34,260 --> 02:42:36,780
I'm still satisfied with it just...

4526
02:42:36,780 --> 02:42:38,900
It's just in there in your fucking container.

4527
02:42:39,660 --> 02:42:40,240
In my house.

4528
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:43,180
Yeah with disco ball.

4529
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:44,600
It's a fucking disco ball.

4530
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:45,700
It's a disco ball.

4531
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:46,280
Out of all the models.

4532
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:47,680
They put it in disco ball.

4533
02:42:47,980 --> 02:42:50,380
It's literally the only thing I looted.

4534
02:42:50,480 --> 02:42:51,680
That's all I care about.

4535
02:42:51,980 --> 02:42:52,220
Woah woah woah.

4536
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:53,580
Oh shit.

4537
02:42:53,660 --> 02:42:54,260
Oh shit.

4538
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:55,240
Is that boss?

4539
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:56,820
Oh shit.

4540
02:42:56,840 --> 02:42:57,600
What level is it?

4541
02:42:58,180 --> 02:42:58,940
He's level 8.

4542
02:42:59,100 --> 02:42:59,880
We can do this.

4543
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:00,340
We can do it.

4544
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:01,260
This is what we trained for.

4545
02:43:02,220 --> 02:43:02,620
He's...

4546
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:04,820
He's not taking that much of a damage man.

4547
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,280
This is what we trained for.

4548
02:43:07,460 --> 02:43:08,840
This is what we trained for.

4549
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:11,280
I need your help man.

4550
02:43:11,480 --> 02:43:12,980
I'm literally shooting him!

4551
02:43:13,220 --> 02:43:13,740
Use your butterfly!

4552
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:15,880
Oh he's...

4553
02:43:15,880 --> 02:43:16,200
What's his weakness?

4554
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:16,840
What is his weakness?

4555
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:17,900
Is it the little...

4556
02:43:17,900 --> 02:43:18,680
You see the leg?

4557
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:19,140
The leg?

4558
02:43:19,140 --> 02:43:19,660
You see the leg?

4559
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:19,980
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

4560
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:21,180
Use your butterfly.

4561
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:22,420
I did.

4562
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:22,660
I did.

4563
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:25,140
I have a fear of butterflies.

4564
02:43:25,700 --> 02:43:26,500
Jesus Christ.

4565
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:26,820
Okay.

4566
02:43:28,100 --> 02:43:29,800
Oh my gosh I should've made more ammo.

4567
02:43:29,820 --> 02:43:31,220
The butterfly scares anymore aimbosses.

4568
02:43:31,240 --> 02:43:31,480
I should've made more ammo.

4569
02:43:31,480 --> 02:43:32,140
Oh wait wait.

4570
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:32,880
Oh it's all...

4571
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:33,480
Oh wait wait wait.

4572
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:34,700
He's stunned.

4573
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:36,860
We're supposed to shoot the...

4574
02:43:36,860 --> 02:43:37,840
Shoot his...

4575
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:38,740
Yeah, shoot the flower!

4576
02:43:38,940 --> 02:43:39,200
What?

4577
02:43:42,140 --> 02:43:43,800
I mean he does look like it.

4578
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:44,600
Is he dead?

4579
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:45,180
Oh!

4580
02:43:52,020 --> 02:43:52,900
Okay...

4581
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:01,280
Okay...

4582
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:02,820
Oh my god...

4583
02:44:04,060 --> 02:44:05,140
Yeah, that's... that's...

4584
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:07,280
Yeah, well...

4585
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:10,140
Well... to be fair...

4586
02:44:10,140 --> 02:44:12,020
It's launch day, you know.

4587
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:12,940
It just launched today.

4588
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:17,120
The ragdoll is so...

4589
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:20,200
What a ragdoll.

4590
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:22,260
Holy shit.

4591
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:27,040
I'm heading over.

4592
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:28,560
Okay, it's done.

4593
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:29,760
What the fuck?

4594
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:31,900
Obtain tier 1 craft...

4595
02:44:31,900 --> 02:44:32,640
Craft?

4596
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:34,820
They keep wanting us to craft shit.

4597
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:35,420
I'm tired of it.

4598
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:36,200
They love crafting.

4599
02:44:38,180 --> 02:44:39,580
Oh, meet Mary.

4600
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:40,700
No, we gotta meet Mary.

4601
02:44:41,460 --> 02:44:42,320
Meet Mary?

4602
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:43,040
Yeah.

4603
02:44:43,320 --> 02:44:44,480
It says meet Mary.

4604
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:45,960
What does it say for you?

4605
02:44:47,060 --> 02:44:48,160
Obtain tier 1 craft.

4606
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:50,060
Wait, what?

4607
02:44:51,100 --> 02:44:51,620
What?

4608
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:53,480
It doesn't say that for me.

4609
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:55,720
Let's see...

4610
02:44:56,440 --> 02:44:56,960
What?

4611
02:44:58,200 --> 02:44:58,720
Oh...

4612
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:02,460
Okay, I need a fucking... Prepare any kinds of ammo.

4613
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:03,840
I...

4614
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,400
I'm heading back with you.

4615
02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:09,680
Maybe it's because I need ammo.

4616
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:11,740
Why does it say meet Mary for me?

4617
02:45:12,540 --> 02:45:13,060
What?

4618
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:15,500
Maybe you filled the requirements and I didn't.

4619
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:17,420
It says welcome... It says meet Mary.

4620
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:18,980
What?

4621
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:20,460
Obtain tier 1 armor.

4622
02:45:20,560 --> 02:45:21,240
Craft on the top.

4623
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:21,780
What?

4624
02:45:22,260 --> 02:45:23,500
Okay, that's weird.

4625
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:25,040
Uh...

4626
02:45:26,540 --> 02:45:29,420
Yeah, it says meet Mary under the monolith for me.

4627
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:30,500
What?

4628
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:33,580
Maybe I don't have enough ammo and some shit.

4629
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:35,720
Well, I have like... Literally have like...

4630
02:45:36,600 --> 02:45:38,020
Oh, there's another phone call.

4631
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:41,640
Mushy-mushy.

4632
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:46,420
My sister stumbled across a huge toy rabbit downstairs.

4633
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:48,260
My sister stumbled across a huge toy rabbit downstairs.

4634
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:49,840
What the fuck is this message?

4635
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:51,180
What the fuck?

4636
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:52,800
Alright, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna meet Mary.

4637
02:45:54,020 --> 02:45:55,000
You're gonna meet Mary?

4638
02:45:55,100 --> 02:45:55,640
You gotta craft a suit?

4639
02:45:55,780 --> 02:45:56,260
Yeah.

4640
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:58,220
And then I'll see if I start crafting after.

4641
02:45:59,380 --> 02:46:01,260
It's weird that you...

4642
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:03,700
You don't have the same thing as me.

4643
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:05,020
I feel like you should.

4644
02:46:06,120 --> 02:46:07,380
I should, yes.

4645
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:09,500
Yeah, we literally did the quest together.

4646
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:10,260
Like...

4647
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:12,200
Like what?

4648
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:13,020
Enemies approaching.

4649
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:17,000
Copper... copper...

4650
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:18,860
Alright, I'm heading over.

4651
02:46:20,940 --> 02:46:21,620
Weeeeee!

4652
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:27,100
Alright.

4653
02:46:27,300 --> 02:46:30,080
Ooh, somebody lives here.

4654
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:31,760
Oh, Mary lives here.

4655
02:46:32,320 --> 02:46:33,320
Hello, Mary!

4656
02:46:34,680 --> 02:46:35,560
I need...

4657
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:37,000
I need... adhesive.

4658
02:46:37,480 --> 02:46:38,440
I don't have adhesive.

4659
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:41,920
Where do I find adhesive?

4660
02:46:43,240 --> 02:46:44,240
Where do I find adhesive?

4661
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:44,400
I need this.

4662
02:46:44,600 --> 02:46:46,080
What am I crafting throwing daggers for?

4663
02:46:47,740 --> 02:46:48,700
Sounds tough.

4664
02:46:49,080 --> 02:46:51,660
What are you doing all these things and I'm just meeting Mary?

4665
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:56,000
You meet Mary and I'm doing tier one shit and I'm like what?

4666
02:46:57,240 --> 02:47:00,380
I was told to craft stuff and then they just like...

4667
02:47:00,380 --> 02:47:02,400
told you to do that and I'm like...

4668
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:03,180
This is...

4669
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:06,080
I find this highly oppressing.

4670
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:08,780
Yeah, I get to preguess the plot.

4671
02:47:10,900 --> 02:47:12,740
And you don't.

4672
02:47:13,020 --> 02:47:13,800
And you don't.

4673
02:47:14,260 --> 02:47:14,860
What the fuck is this?

4674
02:47:14,940 --> 02:47:15,720
This is not fair.

4675
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:19,560
Oh, she has ammo and meds.

4676
02:47:19,580 --> 02:47:20,400
You had to craft.

4677
02:47:20,500 --> 02:47:22,360
She's giving me ammo and meds.

4678
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:23,280
Oh shit.

4679
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:24,320
What the fuck?

4680
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:26,360
My bike... vehicle is damaged.

4681
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:27,300
Please repair in garage.

4682
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:28,400
What the fuck?

4683
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:30,640
I lost my bike.

4684
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:31,540
Congratulations.

4685
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:34,600
Wait, you destroyed your bike?

4686
02:47:35,020 --> 02:47:35,480
Yes.

4687
02:47:36,660 --> 02:47:37,480
That's funny.

4688
02:47:37,820 --> 02:47:38,780
That's pretty funny.

4689
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:39,660
I know.

4690
02:47:39,820 --> 02:47:41,720
Follow the guidance and exp...

4691
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:43,200
How did you do all that?

4692
02:47:43,300 --> 02:47:43,620
Like...

4693
02:47:44,260 --> 02:47:45,280
I still have my stuff.

4694
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:47,700
Oh, apparently...

4695
02:47:47,700 --> 02:47:48,840
I have a boss fight here.

4696
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:51,100
You have a boss fight?

4697
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:51,760
The fuck?

4698
02:47:51,940 --> 02:47:52,700
Yeah, where are you?

4699
02:47:52,720 --> 02:47:53,600
There's like so many...

4700
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:55,940
Everybody has their campgrounds here.

4701
02:47:56,140 --> 02:47:57,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4702
02:47:58,020 --> 02:47:58,460
What?

4703
02:47:59,620 --> 02:48:00,880
Where are you?

4704
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:02,040
Everybody's here.

4705
02:48:02,140 --> 02:48:03,020
Hold on, I'm gonna find some stuff.

4706
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:06,260
Is it cause you... wait, is it cause you established your campgrounds?

4707
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:08,580
I don't know.

4708
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:09,520
Did you do that already?

4709
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:10,480
Maybe that's why.

4710
02:48:11,060 --> 02:48:14,120
Yeah, maybe that's why you already established your campgrounds.

4711
02:48:14,260 --> 02:48:15,980
So then like it just told you to go back to it.

4712
02:48:16,640 --> 02:48:17,580
Hold on, hold on.

4713
02:48:17,700 --> 02:48:18,940
I need to make some stuff.

4714
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:19,720
This is a thing.

4715
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:20,900
I'm gonna wait.

4716
02:48:21,080 --> 02:48:21,400
I don't get it.

4717
02:48:22,920 --> 02:48:24,640
I'm gonna wait for you at the top of the mountain.

4718
02:48:29,190 --> 02:48:30,770
Can I TP back to the home?

4719
02:48:31,370 --> 02:48:32,250
You TP'd me?

4720
02:48:33,830 --> 02:48:35,450
There's a boss fight apparently up here.

4721
02:48:36,790 --> 02:48:37,670
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

4722
02:48:40,650 --> 02:48:42,570
Guys, not wearing pants was a choice.

4723
02:48:43,470 --> 02:48:47,330
Hahahaha It was a choice.

4724
02:48:48,890 --> 02:48:50,890
My attention, I'm waiting for you.

4725
02:48:51,230 --> 02:48:53,170
I don't have a bike, you little man.

4726
02:48:54,190 --> 02:48:55,230
Just TP!

4727
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:57,470
To where?

4728
02:48:58,050 --> 02:48:58,350
Me!

4729
02:48:58,930 --> 02:49:00,550
I have to do my shit first.

4730
02:49:00,570 --> 02:49:01,650
I have to craft my stuff.

4731
02:49:01,890 --> 02:49:02,330
Oh my god.

4732
02:49:03,390 --> 02:49:04,770
God damn it.

4733
02:49:06,050 --> 02:49:07,390
Alright, let's see.

4734
02:49:07,610 --> 02:49:09,110
I need to...

4735
02:49:09,110 --> 02:49:12,170
Oh my gosh, I need to hydrate really badly.

4736
02:49:12,390 --> 02:49:13,470
I need to hydrate really badly.

4737
02:49:14,890 --> 02:49:16,150
Don't worry, I'm drinking.

4738
02:49:16,430 --> 02:49:17,270
I'm hydrating.

4739
02:49:20,860 --> 02:49:22,960
Hey, Steve-o wants to join our team.

4740
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:23,900
Hey, Steve-o wants to join our team.

4741
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:24,360
Alright, Steve-o.

4742
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:25,420
Come in here.

4743
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:27,540
Steve-o!

4744
02:49:27,740 --> 02:49:28,800
Yeah, Steve-o.

4745
02:49:28,820 --> 02:49:29,640
Get in here.

4746
02:49:30,120 --> 02:49:30,320
Yeah, Steve-o.

4747
02:49:30,320 --> 02:49:30,320
Get in here.

4748
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:35,000
Alright, uh...

4749
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,280
I'm radiated.

4750
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:37,280
I gotta cure myself.

4751
02:49:37,420 --> 02:49:38,220
You're radiated?

4752
02:49:38,220 --> 02:49:39,540
What did you do?

4753
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:42,680
I jumped in the fucking water.

4754
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:44,960
What the fuck did you do?

4755
02:49:45,060 --> 02:49:46,380
Where even are you?

4756
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:48,780
I jumped in the fucking water.

4757
02:49:48,780 --> 02:49:49,300
Oh, there you are.

4758
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:50,360
You're back home.

4759
02:49:50,920 --> 02:49:53,680
Yeah, I'm walking home because I don't have a bike.

4760
02:49:53,720 --> 02:49:55,520
Wait, don't you have fast travel?

4761
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:56,880
Wait, don't you have fast travel?

4762
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:58,520
There's teleport or fucking cooldown.

4763
02:49:58,980 --> 02:49:59,820
Oh, well.

4764
02:50:00,040 --> 02:50:00,580
Alright, goodbye.

4765
02:50:01,900 --> 02:50:03,100
Fuck you!

4766
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:06,360
Fuck you!

4767
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:06,440
Fuck you!

4768
02:50:07,920 --> 02:50:08,900
Oh my god.

4769
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:10,580
Everybody's campground's here.

4770
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:13,540
Oh, Steve-o left our team!

4771
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:14,780
Oh, Steve-o left our team!

4772
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:15,660
Steve-o hates us.

4773
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:16,800
Steve-o hates you.

4774
02:50:17,860 --> 02:50:18,340
What?

4775
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:19,380
How dare you?

4776
02:50:20,860 --> 02:50:22,060
How dare he hates me?

4777
02:50:22,700 --> 02:50:23,820
I'm a lovable person.

4778
02:50:24,600 --> 02:50:25,500
What the fuck?

4779
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:26,040
Alright, Z.

4780
02:50:26,100 --> 02:50:26,800
You go first.

4781
02:50:26,860 --> 02:50:28,460
And kill everybody for me.

4782
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:31,980
Woah.

4783
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:33,920
Go do it.

4784
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:35,800
I'm mooching off this guy.

4785
02:50:36,980 --> 02:50:37,720
Mooching off?

4786
02:50:37,880 --> 02:50:38,520
When are you not?

4787
02:50:38,560 --> 02:50:38,600
Don't worry.

4788
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:42,340
I have somebody else to do everything for me.

4789
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:46,620
Don't worry.

4790
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:46,620
I have somebody else to do everything for me.

4791
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:46,860
Don't worry.

4792
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:46,860
I have somebody else to do everything for me.

4793
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:50,360
He's killing everybody for me now.

4794
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:51,800
Must be Z.

4795
02:50:55,950 --> 02:50:56,950
Let's see.

4796
02:50:57,670 --> 02:51:00,090
There's an alligator outside of my house.

4797
02:51:00,610 --> 02:51:01,330
Whoops.

4798
02:51:01,410 --> 02:51:02,570
I alerted him accidentally.

4799
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:05,370
There's an alligator outside your house?

4800
02:51:05,870 --> 02:51:06,270
Yeah.

4801
02:51:07,950 --> 02:51:09,070
Go, Kerry.

4802
02:51:09,230 --> 02:51:09,450
Go.

4803
02:51:10,850 --> 02:51:12,510
Am I finally making a pants?

4804
02:51:12,510 --> 02:51:12,870
Go do your thing.

4805
02:51:13,950 --> 02:51:16,010
No, don't make your pants.

4806
02:51:16,850 --> 02:51:18,810
Pants are for cowards.

4807
02:51:18,830 --> 02:51:19,150
I told you to make shit.

4808
02:51:19,150 --> 02:51:19,170
I told you to make shit.

4809
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:21,170
I told you to make it.

4810
02:51:21,230 --> 02:51:21,670
That's the thing.

4811
02:51:21,710 --> 02:51:23,130
I can't progress if I can't make pants.

4812
02:51:23,230 --> 02:51:24,950
Hey, why do you have to make pants?

4813
02:51:25,350 --> 02:51:26,870
I don't know.

4814
02:51:27,670 --> 02:51:28,450
That's what I'd like to know.

4815
02:51:28,450 --> 02:51:29,670
It never told me to make pants.

4816
02:51:30,210 --> 02:51:31,930
I'm just playing the game.

4817
02:51:33,790 --> 02:51:34,430
I'm just playing the game.

4818
02:51:34,970 --> 02:51:36,210
Go, rotten guy.

4819
02:51:36,370 --> 02:51:36,650
Go.

4820
02:51:36,850 --> 02:51:37,830
That's a shit ass pants.

4821
02:51:37,970 --> 02:51:39,270
It's not even a complete pants.

4822
02:51:39,410 --> 02:51:42,650
Oh my god.

4823
02:51:42,670 --> 02:51:44,850
I almost shot the explosive tank.

4824
02:51:45,390 --> 02:51:45,830
Oh my god.

4825
02:51:45,830 --> 02:51:45,830
I almost shot the explosive tank.

4826
02:51:47,170 --> 02:51:48,490
Go, guy with gun.

4827
02:51:48,650 --> 02:51:48,930
Go.

4828
02:51:53,880 --> 02:51:54,400
Boom.

4829
02:51:59,400 --> 02:52:00,180
That's right.

4830
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:02,460
That's right, Wylo.

4831
02:52:02,980 --> 02:52:04,180
We're doing it.

4832
02:52:04,360 --> 02:52:05,300
We don't need tension.

4833
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:06,560
What?

4834
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:09,620
What are you actually doing right now?

4835
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:10,360
Are you fighting a boss?

4836
02:52:10,520 --> 02:52:12,720
No, we're just walking.

4837
02:52:13,220 --> 02:52:16,380
There's like an area where we have to go through.

4838
02:52:18,360 --> 02:52:22,520
And like this guy coincidentally was also going through this area.

4839
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:23,440
I'm just kidding.

4840
02:52:23,460 --> 02:52:24,140
I'm just kidding.

4841
02:52:27,220 --> 02:52:30,040
So there's like a lot of enemies too.

4842
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:33,960
Oh, there is loot here.

4843
02:52:36,020 --> 02:52:36,740
Nice.

4844
02:52:41,570 --> 02:52:47,750
Yeah, so like I was lucky because like he was also going through this area too.

4845
02:52:50,530 --> 02:52:52,510
Okay, I fucked up.

4846
02:52:52,690 --> 02:52:54,970
I was trying to...

4847
02:52:54,970 --> 02:52:56,250
I fell.

4848
02:52:56,750 --> 02:52:58,470
From a really high place.

4849
02:53:00,170 --> 02:53:01,370
Must have hurt.

4850
02:53:01,930 --> 02:53:02,610
Yeah.

4851
02:53:02,690 --> 02:53:04,710
I think that was karma.

4852
02:53:05,190 --> 02:53:08,150
This game took two hours to make pants.

4853
02:53:08,290 --> 02:53:08,890
I think that was karma.

4854
02:53:13,150 --> 02:53:15,390
There's like elite monsters here.

4855
02:53:15,830 --> 02:53:17,730
Where can I put my garage?

4856
02:53:19,870 --> 02:53:20,590
There's like elite monsters here.

4857
02:53:21,290 --> 02:53:23,470
What do we do, Wylo?

4858
02:53:24,450 --> 02:53:25,870
What are you gonna shoot?

4859
02:53:26,170 --> 02:53:27,730
I put the garage in the weirdest place possible.

4860
02:53:27,990 --> 02:53:29,010
Jesus Christ.

4861
02:53:29,030 --> 02:53:30,070
Don't worry, Wylo.

4862
02:53:30,190 --> 02:53:30,970
I'm here to help.

4863
02:53:32,650 --> 02:53:34,130
Don't worry, Wylo.

4864
02:53:34,690 --> 02:53:35,870
How do I fix it?

4865
02:53:37,290 --> 02:53:37,770
Repair.

4866
02:53:38,250 --> 02:53:38,730
Irons.

4867
02:53:38,870 --> 02:53:39,590
I need irons.

4868
02:53:40,510 --> 02:53:45,570
All I'm saying, Tengen, by the time you actually do this mission, all the monsters will be dead.

4869
02:53:45,770 --> 02:53:46,350
Oh, there we go.

4870
02:53:46,350 --> 02:53:46,710
It's normal.

4871
02:53:46,890 --> 02:53:50,870
Okay, so the pants is now done.

4872
02:53:50,970 --> 02:53:52,910
Now it says meet Mary under model.

4873
02:53:52,990 --> 02:53:53,450
Now it says meet Mary under model.

4874
02:53:53,970 --> 02:53:55,470
Why did I need to make pants?

4875
02:53:55,550 --> 02:53:56,470
I had no idea.

4876
02:53:56,550 --> 02:53:58,090
I didn't have to make pants.

4877
02:53:58,370 --> 02:53:59,090
I just progressed.

4878
02:54:00,130 --> 02:54:01,230
What the fuck?

4879
02:54:01,830 --> 02:54:02,310
No!

4880
02:54:03,730 --> 02:54:04,690
That's stupid.

4881
02:54:04,710 --> 02:54:06,490
Why did you do that?

4882
02:54:06,850 --> 02:54:07,870
Don't be dumb.

4883
02:54:16,020 --> 02:54:16,500
Alright.

4884
02:54:18,440 --> 02:54:19,760
Okay, I got the stuff.

4885
02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:23,940
All the monsters are dead by the...

4886
02:54:23,940 --> 02:54:25,560
Like, the majority of the monsters are dead.

4887
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:26,740
So you don't have to worry about it.

4888
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:28,900
Alright.

4889
02:54:29,060 --> 02:54:29,880
I got the shit.

4890
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:31,140
Can I TP to you?

4891
02:54:31,460 --> 02:54:32,180
Oh, can you?

4892
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:35,320
How do I teleport to you?

4893
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:37,420
Nah, I'll just go to Deadspiel.

4894
02:54:38,720 --> 02:54:39,560
Oh yeah, no, no.

4895
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:41,540
You have to TP to talk to Mary first.

4896
02:54:42,920 --> 02:54:43,760
And then...

4897
02:54:46,320 --> 02:54:47,140
Oh my god.

4898
02:54:47,240 --> 02:54:48,340
That's not what I wanted to do.

4899
02:54:48,380 --> 02:54:49,940
I wanted to loot the item.

4900
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:54,540
Alright.

4901
02:54:55,300 --> 02:54:55,720
Oosh.

4902
02:54:57,780 --> 02:54:58,200
Oh!

4903
02:54:59,060 --> 02:54:59,780
So many mats.

4904
02:55:03,330 --> 02:55:04,450
Alright, let's do this.

4905
02:55:04,610 --> 02:55:04,850
Okay.

4906
02:55:05,270 --> 02:55:06,110
What's this loot?

4907
02:55:06,290 --> 02:55:06,750
I'm on my way.

4908
02:55:06,810 --> 02:55:08,650
I'm gonna talk to Mary and then I'll go to Deadspiel.

4909
02:55:08,650 --> 02:55:10,530
Yeah, the moment you talk to Mary...

4910
02:55:10,530 --> 02:55:13,070
Then you're like at my quest area.

4911
02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:14,470
Right.

4912
02:55:14,770 --> 02:55:15,410
Hello, Wile.

4913
02:55:15,570 --> 02:55:16,830
What are you doing?

4914
02:55:17,770 --> 02:55:18,810
What are you gonna do?

4915
02:55:23,110 --> 02:55:23,590
What?

4916
02:55:24,770 --> 02:55:25,750
I can't read that.

4917
02:55:26,210 --> 02:55:28,430
He said there's one...

4918
02:55:28,430 --> 02:55:28,650
Guys!

4919
02:55:28,930 --> 02:55:29,970
Somebody translate!

4920
02:55:30,310 --> 02:55:33,470
I can only read like half that sentence and he's trying to talk to me.

4921
02:55:33,870 --> 02:55:34,810
He's actually...

4922
02:55:34,810 --> 02:55:36,350
He's random actually.

4923
02:55:36,430 --> 02:55:37,850
He's trying to talk to me.

4924
02:55:40,450 --> 02:55:41,390
I don't know.

4925
02:55:42,110 --> 02:55:43,390
No, he's chat.

4926
02:55:43,610 --> 02:55:44,390
The Wile guy.

4927
02:55:45,330 --> 02:55:45,810
Oh.

4928
02:55:47,450 --> 02:55:48,270
That guy!

4929
02:55:48,470 --> 02:55:49,530
That guy is...

4930
02:55:49,530 --> 02:55:50,850
I don't know if he's trying to talk to me.

4931
02:55:51,710 --> 02:55:53,630
Oh, there's a level 5 big one.

4932
02:55:53,750 --> 02:55:54,050
Okay.

4933
02:55:54,330 --> 02:55:54,810
Okay.

4934
02:55:56,750 --> 02:55:57,230
Alright.

4935
02:55:58,430 --> 02:55:58,690
I'm gonna go to this area.

4936
02:55:59,030 --> 02:56:00,930
Okay, I'm gonna make my campsite.

4937
02:56:00,950 --> 02:56:01,210
Where did he go?

4938
02:56:01,210 --> 02:56:01,810
I don't have a log.

4939
02:56:02,890 --> 02:56:06,430
You're such a mess right now.

4940
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:09,150
You don't have a log.

4941
02:56:09,330 --> 02:56:09,850
No!

4942
02:56:10,050 --> 02:56:11,450
I lost my carry!

4943
02:56:12,390 --> 02:56:14,110
Oh, he's over there killing more people.

4944
02:56:14,830 --> 02:56:15,610
Don't worry!

4945
02:56:15,810 --> 02:56:16,710
I'm coming over!

4946
02:56:19,250 --> 02:56:19,770
Wait!

4947
02:56:19,890 --> 02:56:21,310
He respawned?

4948
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:24,880
Yeah, because he...

4949
02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:25,220
Oh my god.

4950
02:56:25,580 --> 02:56:27,660
One of the big guys respawned.

4951
02:56:28,320 --> 02:56:29,320
But I need...

4952
02:56:29,800 --> 02:56:30,340
I need the carry.

4953
02:56:32,220 --> 02:56:33,660
I need the carry here.

4954
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:35,480
Wait, where did he go?

4955
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:37,280
Wile!

4956
02:56:38,860 --> 02:56:39,380
Hey.

4957
02:56:39,540 --> 02:56:41,020
I need you to protect me.

4958
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:41,900
Oh!

4959
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:44,820
You don't eat something.

4960
02:56:45,320 --> 02:56:46,100
Wait, what?

4961
02:56:47,560 --> 02:56:49,840
I'm in... something something.

4962
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:51,800
Oh my gosh.

4963
02:56:51,860 --> 02:56:53,640
I can only read half of it.

4964
02:56:56,160 --> 02:56:57,760
Yeah, well it's better than none.

4965
02:56:57,860 --> 02:56:59,460
Yeah, well it's better than none.

4966
02:56:59,460 --> 02:57:01,760
Wait, I think he's not talking to me.

4967
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:03,300
I think he's talking to his other...

4968
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:05,000
His other clanmates.

4969
02:57:07,220 --> 02:57:08,860
I think he's talking...

4970
02:57:08,860 --> 02:57:11,060
He's talking to his buddies.

4971
02:57:11,960 --> 02:57:12,700
Oh dude.

4972
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:14,000
Not eat food.

4973
02:57:14,160 --> 02:57:14,560
Okay.

4974
02:57:19,340 --> 02:57:20,180
Where are you?

4975
02:57:20,820 --> 02:57:21,780
I'm on top.

4976
02:57:21,780 --> 02:57:22,140
Holy shit.

4977
02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:24,280
What is that thing?

4978
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:27,460
What the fuck is that thing?

4979
02:57:27,460 --> 02:57:27,860
Are you here?

4980
02:57:28,720 --> 02:57:29,740
Yeah, I see it.

4981
02:57:29,800 --> 02:57:30,440
You see it?

4982
02:57:30,480 --> 02:57:31,240
You see the big boy?

4983
02:57:31,980 --> 02:57:32,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4984
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:34,440
What the fuck is that?

4985
02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:37,360
Oh shit, I didn't see this guy.

4986
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:43,950
Oh my god.

4987
02:57:44,750 --> 02:57:45,110
Jesus.

4988
02:57:47,150 --> 02:57:48,710
I don't even see... Oh there you are.

4989
02:57:48,870 --> 02:57:49,730
Yeah, that's the big guy.

4990
02:57:51,330 --> 02:57:52,390
Look, there's the other guy.

4991
02:57:52,450 --> 02:57:53,210
That was my friend.

4992
02:57:54,630 --> 02:57:55,850
That's my friend over there.

4993
02:57:56,610 --> 02:57:57,330
That's his...

4994
02:57:57,330 --> 02:57:58,570
The fuck is that?

4995
02:57:58,790 --> 02:57:59,950
Oh god, come back.

4996
02:57:59,970 --> 02:58:00,530
You're fighting again.

4997
02:58:01,250 --> 02:58:01,550
I'm behind you.

4998
02:58:03,050 --> 02:58:03,450
Holy...

4999
02:58:05,870 --> 02:58:06,590
Behind you.

5000
02:58:07,070 --> 02:58:07,470
Okay.

5001
02:58:07,610 --> 02:58:07,750
Yeah.

5002
02:58:10,090 --> 02:58:10,870
Okay, don't worry.

5003
02:58:11,350 --> 02:58:12,150
I'm shooting him.

5004
02:58:15,310 --> 02:58:15,710
Oh...

5005
02:58:17,770 --> 02:58:19,010
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5006
02:58:19,150 --> 02:58:20,570
Okay, we have to go to the main quest line.

5007
02:58:20,690 --> 02:58:22,210
See, I told you I wait for you.

5008
02:58:23,610 --> 02:58:24,010
Right.

5009
02:58:24,270 --> 02:58:25,470
I waited for you.

5010
02:58:26,170 --> 02:58:26,570
Right.

5011
02:58:27,910 --> 02:58:28,810
What are you saying?

5012
02:58:31,250 --> 02:58:31,650
Surely.

5013
02:58:33,250 --> 02:58:34,870
That wild guy.

5014
02:58:35,210 --> 02:58:36,150
He's nobody.

5015
02:58:37,490 --> 02:58:38,630
Make it easier.

5016
02:58:43,990 --> 02:58:45,350
Wait, that's not wild.

5017
02:58:45,730 --> 02:58:46,850
Oh my god, it's P Diddy.

5018
02:58:47,530 --> 02:58:48,150
Yeah, I know.

5019
02:58:48,230 --> 02:58:48,870
It's P Diddy.

5020
02:58:49,070 --> 02:58:49,730
Yeah, wait.

5021
02:58:49,830 --> 02:58:51,990
P Diddy is still doing this quest?

5022
02:58:52,290 --> 02:58:54,170
We were like fucking around.

5023
02:58:54,490 --> 02:58:55,790
We saw P...

5024
02:58:55,790 --> 02:58:57,670
What was P Diddy doing?

5025
02:58:58,130 --> 02:59:00,650
He was probably fucking around like us.

5026
02:59:00,750 --> 02:59:01,070
Yeah.

5027
02:59:02,430 --> 02:59:03,370
Oh my god.

5028
02:59:03,450 --> 02:59:04,610
Where did Wild go?

5029
02:59:07,190 --> 02:59:07,990
Oh shit.

5030
02:59:08,110 --> 02:59:09,110
Oh hey, it's our favorite.

5031
02:59:09,330 --> 02:59:11,010
Oh my god, P Diddy just like...

5032
02:59:11,010 --> 02:59:12,530
ran across from him.

5033
02:59:13,150 --> 02:59:14,830
I'm shooting the legs.

5034
02:59:15,650 --> 02:59:17,090
Alright, you should drop down now.

5035
02:59:21,530 --> 02:59:22,410
Holy shit.

5036
02:59:22,450 --> 02:59:24,670
That's like 700 damage through a slice.

5037
02:59:24,990 --> 02:59:25,390
Holy shit.

5038
02:59:25,390 --> 02:59:25,390
That's like 700 damage through a slice.

5039
02:59:25,390 --> 02:59:25,430
Nice.

5040
02:59:25,630 --> 02:59:27,470
Yeah, I'm trying not to waste too many bullets.

5041
02:59:28,110 --> 02:59:28,550
Yeah.

5042
02:59:29,770 --> 02:59:31,250
I just realized...

5043
02:59:31,250 --> 02:59:33,310
Alright, there it is.

5044
02:59:33,730 --> 02:59:34,410
Boss fight.

5045
02:59:34,450 --> 02:59:34,790
Oh my god.

5046
02:59:34,830 --> 02:59:36,290
Somebody broke their bike as well.

5047
02:59:37,670 --> 02:59:38,910
It's probably P Diddy.

5048
02:59:39,710 --> 02:59:43,150
The Monarch and his leftover public crafting facilities available.

5049
02:59:44,090 --> 02:59:45,850
I recommend it to team up first.

5050
02:59:46,870 --> 02:59:48,750
Collect supplies and discard...

5051
02:59:48,750 --> 02:59:49,190
Oh, what?

5052
02:59:50,650 --> 02:59:51,550
Catch a glimpse.

5053
02:59:52,070 --> 02:59:52,970
Locate the rift.

5054
02:59:53,450 --> 02:59:54,930
It is recommended to team up first.

5055
02:59:55,010 --> 02:59:55,550
Are we teamed up?

5056
02:59:56,090 --> 02:59:56,750
Yeah, we are.

5057
02:59:57,930 --> 03:00:01,230
Oh, this is like we can get materials before we go in for a boss fight.

5058
03:00:01,230 --> 03:00:02,770
Grab some shit.

5059
03:00:05,090 --> 03:00:05,910
Press Q.

5060
03:00:06,170 --> 03:00:06,610
Okay.

5061
03:00:06,690 --> 03:00:07,570
Just to see shit.

5062
03:00:08,670 --> 03:00:09,450
Hello, Mary.

5063
03:00:09,690 --> 03:00:10,290
There's a lot of stuff.

5064
03:00:10,570 --> 03:00:11,210
I'm gonna talk to Mary.

5065
03:00:12,870 --> 03:00:13,790
Speak to Mary.

5066
03:00:13,810 --> 03:00:15,710
You're quite good at handling deviants, aren't you?

5067
03:00:15,850 --> 03:00:16,650
I have an amplifier.

5068
03:00:17,090 --> 03:00:17,630
Rustic hat?

5069
03:00:18,130 --> 03:00:20,810
How does a rustic... A rustic hat?

5070
03:00:21,210 --> 03:00:22,370
What the fuck was that word?

5071
03:00:22,710 --> 03:00:23,150
How...

5072
03:00:24,010 --> 03:00:25,870
I think I have enough ammo.

5073
03:00:26,370 --> 03:00:28,530
I wonder if I can craft...

5074
03:00:28,530 --> 03:00:29,590
Can I craft better guns?

5075
03:00:31,230 --> 03:00:31,310
Yeah.

5076
03:00:31,990 --> 03:00:32,770
Let's see.

5077
03:00:33,550 --> 03:00:34,230
Oh, I can.

5078
03:00:36,970 --> 03:00:37,670
Never mind.

5079
03:00:37,850 --> 03:00:39,970
I'm literally missing waste plastic.

5080
03:00:40,190 --> 03:00:41,770
I must have waste plastic here.

5081
03:00:42,410 --> 03:00:44,950
I just need some rusted parts, actually.

5082
03:00:45,950 --> 03:00:47,210
Then I'll get a better gun.

5083
03:00:47,370 --> 03:00:48,230
Okay, let's see.

5084
03:00:50,250 --> 03:00:50,730
Assembling...

5085
03:00:51,410 --> 03:00:53,090
I think I can... I'm gonna make a shotgun.

5086
03:00:53,870 --> 03:00:55,170
You're gonna make a shotgun?

5087
03:00:55,290 --> 03:00:56,430
Yeah, I'm gonna make a shotgun.

5088
03:00:57,650 --> 03:00:58,930
I found it!

5089
03:00:59,050 --> 03:00:59,870
What do you mean how?

5090
03:01:00,050 --> 03:01:01,030
I found it!

5091
03:01:01,230 --> 03:01:02,130
What the fuck?

5092
03:01:02,330 --> 03:01:03,590
I need... I need rustic...

5093
03:01:03,590 --> 03:01:04,330
material.

5094
03:01:06,030 --> 03:01:06,630
Let's see.

5095
03:01:09,970 --> 03:01:10,790
Do I have enough?

5096
03:01:13,530 --> 03:01:14,690
Oh, I don't!

5097
03:01:14,690 --> 03:01:16,110
I don't have enough waste plastic!

5098
03:01:16,210 --> 03:01:16,970
Do you have waste plastic?

5099
03:01:18,550 --> 03:01:19,390
How much is...

5100
03:01:19,390 --> 03:01:20,250
Where is the waste plastic?

5101
03:01:20,310 --> 03:01:21,630
I need two waste plastic.

5102
03:01:23,090 --> 03:01:24,650
What's a waste plastic?

5103
03:01:24,870 --> 03:01:25,630
I don't know.

5104
03:01:25,730 --> 03:01:26,770
I don't know how to get it.

5105
03:01:27,850 --> 03:01:28,390
Let's see.

5106
03:01:28,470 --> 03:01:29,330
Maybe I can find...

5107
03:01:29,330 --> 03:01:30,690
extra waste around here.

5108
03:01:31,290 --> 03:01:33,290
Waste plastic... I have 13.

5109
03:01:33,530 --> 03:01:35,490
But I think I might need it, though.

5110
03:01:35,830 --> 03:01:37,490
Let's see if there's extra...

5111
03:01:37,490 --> 03:01:38,430
equipment here.

5112
03:01:39,610 --> 03:01:40,130
Snap.

5113
03:01:41,310 --> 03:01:42,250
Is there any stuff?

5114
03:01:42,430 --> 03:01:42,850
Snap.

5115
03:01:43,150 --> 03:01:44,730
I keep snapping around.

5116
03:01:45,530 --> 03:01:46,050
Nooooo!

5117
03:01:48,330 --> 03:01:49,010
Oh, wait.

5118
03:01:49,030 --> 03:01:49,550
There's...

5119
03:01:49,550 --> 03:01:50,030
med kits.

5120
03:01:50,250 --> 03:01:51,650
Okay, I don't need med kits, though.

5121
03:01:52,190 --> 03:01:53,770
Is there... is there waste plastic here?

5122
03:01:54,910 --> 03:01:55,430
Is there...

5123
03:01:55,430 --> 03:01:55,430
is there waste plastic here?

5124
03:01:55,430 --> 03:01:55,870
What if outside?

5125
03:01:55,870 --> 03:01:57,370
Oh, that's true.

5126
03:01:59,670 --> 03:01:59,990
Football!

5127
03:02:00,690 --> 03:02:02,690
Football should be a waste plastic!

5128
03:02:03,270 --> 03:02:03,910
Snap!

5129
03:02:05,210 --> 03:02:06,670
I keep snapping around.

5130
03:02:07,130 --> 03:02:07,630
Alright.

5131
03:02:08,610 --> 03:02:11,510
I'm gonna assemble this football.

5132
03:02:14,510 --> 03:02:16,010
Waste plastic, come on!

5133
03:02:16,750 --> 03:02:19,610
Metal scraps, adhesive, rubber, shabby...

5134
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:19,830
Metal scraps, adhesive, rubber, shabby...

5135
03:02:19,830 --> 03:02:19,830
Yes!

5136
03:02:20,070 --> 03:02:21,810
I just got waste plastic!

5137
03:02:22,350 --> 03:02:23,730
I need rust material.

5138
03:02:23,730 --> 03:02:24,630
Oh my god!

5139
03:02:24,650 --> 03:02:25,850
I just got rust material!

5140
03:02:25,870 --> 03:02:26,950
I got the two I needed!

5141
03:02:27,250 --> 03:02:28,710
Oh my god!

5142
03:02:29,150 --> 03:02:30,590
I was so lucky!

5143
03:02:32,510 --> 03:02:33,530
I got a shotgun.

5144
03:02:34,410 --> 03:02:35,370
You got a shotgun?

5145
03:02:35,550 --> 03:02:36,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5146
03:02:36,570 --> 03:02:36,810
Hold on.

5147
03:02:36,970 --> 03:02:37,990
I'm still looking around.

5148
03:02:38,150 --> 03:02:39,010
Because I need rust parts.

5149
03:02:39,370 --> 03:02:40,230
You need rust parts?

5150
03:02:40,330 --> 03:02:41,150
Have you dissembled everything?

5151
03:02:42,190 --> 03:02:42,950
Uh-huh.

5152
03:02:43,570 --> 03:02:44,090
Okay.

5153
03:02:45,510 --> 03:02:46,030
Nice.

5154
03:02:46,070 --> 03:02:47,870
I have... I have the...

5155
03:02:48,870 --> 03:02:49,610
unspinning shotgun.

5156
03:02:49,910 --> 03:02:51,150
How many bullets do I have now?

5157
03:02:51,610 --> 03:02:54,130
I have... oh, I have 106.

5158
03:02:54,990 --> 03:02:55,850
Yeehaw, Tavis!

5159
03:02:56,850 --> 03:02:57,370
I'm so glad.

5160
03:02:57,370 --> 03:02:57,810
What do you need?

5161
03:02:59,230 --> 03:03:00,490
The metal thing.

5162
03:03:00,910 --> 03:03:03,110
I don't think we can find any.

5163
03:03:03,330 --> 03:03:04,590
The rusted parts.

5164
03:03:05,450 --> 03:03:07,250
Yeah, I used up all my parts.

5165
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:09,450
I found a kettle, so let's see about that.

5166
03:03:14,390 --> 03:03:14,910
Please.

5167
03:03:15,490 --> 03:03:16,010
No!

5168
03:03:16,450 --> 03:03:17,670
What was it?

5169
03:03:18,610 --> 03:03:19,530
Metal scraps.

5170
03:03:23,090 --> 03:03:24,630
It's too late, Tenjin.

5171
03:03:24,670 --> 03:03:25,450
We gotta go in.

5172
03:03:25,450 --> 03:03:26,690
Do you not have rusted parts?

5173
03:03:26,930 --> 03:03:27,670
I can check.

5174
03:03:27,950 --> 03:03:28,510
Let's see.

5175
03:03:29,030 --> 03:03:29,470
Please.

5176
03:03:30,090 --> 03:03:30,990
I just need one.

5177
03:03:31,350 --> 03:03:32,110
I'll be honest.

5178
03:03:32,230 --> 03:03:32,890
I just need one.

5179
03:03:33,510 --> 03:03:39,250
I got metal scrap, adhesive rubber, gunpowder, copper ore...

5180
03:03:39,250 --> 03:03:40,170
Rust... oh, I do!

5181
03:03:40,290 --> 03:03:40,710
I do!

5182
03:03:40,770 --> 03:03:41,050
I do!

5183
03:03:41,190 --> 03:03:41,970
I just need one!

5184
03:03:43,150 --> 03:03:44,550
How do I give you one?

5185
03:03:45,230 --> 03:03:46,690
How do you give items though?

5186
03:03:46,770 --> 03:03:47,330
This thing...

5187
03:03:47,330 --> 03:03:48,630
Control X.

5188
03:03:49,890 --> 03:03:50,550
Oh, okay.

5189
03:03:50,590 --> 03:03:50,770
There.

5190
03:03:50,870 --> 03:03:51,430
You just need one.

5191
03:03:51,450 --> 03:03:51,570
There.

5192
03:03:51,670 --> 03:03:52,590
I discarded one.

5193
03:03:52,590 --> 03:03:53,550
Next to me.

5194
03:03:54,930 --> 03:03:55,610
Oh, that's it?

5195
03:03:56,330 --> 03:03:56,730
Junk.

5196
03:03:56,870 --> 03:03:57,730
Alright, thanks.

5197
03:03:58,790 --> 03:04:00,110
It's time to make a better gun.

5198
03:04:01,090 --> 03:04:02,350
I'm gonna say I need a heal.

5199
03:04:02,410 --> 03:04:02,930
I just realized.

5200
03:04:05,210 --> 03:04:07,710
The moment we defeat one boss, we can leave.

5201
03:04:08,870 --> 03:04:10,450
We'll be done with this game forever.

5202
03:04:15,030 --> 03:04:18,350
I mean, it's a good game, but not for us.

5203
03:04:18,410 --> 03:04:19,050
Not for us.

5204
03:04:20,450 --> 03:04:21,430
I got a gun.

5205
03:04:22,950 --> 03:04:23,510
Better gun.

5206
03:04:23,590 --> 03:04:25,290
We're like remnant players.

5207
03:04:26,530 --> 03:04:26,930
Yep.

5208
03:04:28,690 --> 03:04:29,990
We just wanna pew pew.

5209
03:04:30,270 --> 03:04:31,390
Oh wait, I forgot to speak Merry.

5210
03:04:32,150 --> 03:04:34,410
Oh, you forgot to speak Merry.

5211
03:04:34,690 --> 03:04:36,250
I'll just skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

5212
03:04:36,850 --> 03:04:37,510
Alright, go.

5213
03:04:37,830 --> 03:04:38,330
Let's go.

5214
03:04:38,790 --> 03:04:39,410
It's time.

5215
03:04:41,330 --> 03:04:42,590
How do we get there?

5216
03:04:42,830 --> 03:04:43,750
Where do we do it?

5217
03:04:44,270 --> 03:04:45,310
Why did you jump?

5218
03:04:45,470 --> 03:04:46,050
Why did you...

5219
03:04:46,890 --> 03:04:47,690
There's stairs!

5220
03:04:49,730 --> 03:04:50,950
There's a big stairs.

5221
03:04:50,950 --> 03:04:50,970
No.

5222
03:04:52,590 --> 03:04:53,770
There's stairs, there's stairs.

5223
03:04:56,070 --> 03:04:57,430
Alright, I'm in.

5224
03:04:57,670 --> 03:04:58,230
Are you...

5225
03:04:58,230 --> 03:04:59,610
Do you go in with me?

5226
03:05:00,770 --> 03:05:01,250
Yeah.

5227
03:05:01,390 --> 03:05:02,790
You have to do the action.

5228
03:05:02,950 --> 03:05:04,810
Also, please select the correct difficulty.

5229
03:05:05,290 --> 03:05:06,010
Oh, I don't know.

5230
03:05:07,630 --> 03:05:08,110
Wait.

5231
03:05:08,350 --> 03:05:09,150
Alright, you ready?

5232
03:05:10,130 --> 03:05:11,450
How do we get in?

5233
03:05:13,650 --> 03:05:14,130
Uhhh...

5234
03:05:14,130 --> 03:05:15,210
Wait, do we not...

5235
03:05:15,210 --> 03:05:16,790
Do we not just go in?

5236
03:05:17,050 --> 03:05:20,430
Oh my god, the level 50 and 60.

5237
03:05:21,310 --> 03:05:23,070
I committed four plays.

5238
03:05:23,370 --> 03:05:23,870
Oh, wait!

5239
03:05:23,950 --> 03:05:24,610
It's cause...

5240
03:05:24,610 --> 03:05:26,410
It's cause number 6.

5241
03:05:26,490 --> 03:05:27,970
We're gonna kick you out for one second.

5242
03:05:28,390 --> 03:05:28,910
Okay.

5243
03:05:30,630 --> 03:05:33,730
We need to kick number 6 out for one second.

5244
03:05:33,730 --> 03:05:34,310
Number 6!

5245
03:05:34,810 --> 03:05:39,430
Okay, we're gonna add Motoko in here and then we're gonna kick number 6.

5246
03:05:39,730 --> 03:05:42,350
We will give you... We'll put you back in soon.

5247
03:05:42,430 --> 03:05:43,110
Number 6.

5248
03:05:43,530 --> 03:05:44,050
Okay.

5249
03:05:44,110 --> 03:05:47,090
We need to do this.

5250
03:05:49,170 --> 03:05:50,410
We need to do this.

5251
03:05:50,410 --> 03:05:51,010
We need to do the rift.

5252
03:05:51,550 --> 03:05:52,150
Okay.

5253
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:54,610
There we go.

5254
03:05:56,730 --> 03:05:57,610
Oh yeah.

5255
03:06:02,010 --> 03:06:04,130
I don't even know what we're fighting.

5256
03:06:04,470 --> 03:06:06,570
We're fighting some level 10 monster.

5257
03:06:17,260 --> 03:06:17,860
Oh.

5258
03:06:17,860 --> 03:06:18,920
What the fuck?

5259
03:06:19,080 --> 03:06:20,240
It's like some stranger things.

5260
03:06:20,600 --> 03:06:22,340
You know, it's like stranger things.

5261
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:23,740
They're on the other side.

5262
03:06:25,240 --> 03:06:25,840
Right.

5263
03:06:27,380 --> 03:06:32,000
You are truly a great one.

5264
03:06:32,100 --> 03:06:32,420
You are truly a great one.

5265
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:32,480
What?

5266
03:06:34,400 --> 03:06:36,020
Mercy, please!

5267
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:40,380
Mercy, please!

5268
03:06:40,380 --> 03:06:41,300
What the fuck?

5269
03:06:41,800 --> 03:06:43,540
Even without their submission.

5270
03:06:44,240 --> 03:06:45,320
Oh!

5271
03:06:50,990 --> 03:06:52,070
Oh!

5272
03:06:54,950 --> 03:06:58,630
We are still legion!

5273
03:06:58,970 --> 03:06:59,730
We are still legion!

5274
03:06:59,730 --> 03:07:00,230
We are still legion!

5275
03:07:00,330 --> 03:07:02,150
We are still legion!

5276
03:07:02,150 --> 03:07:02,790
We are still legion!

5277
03:07:02,870 --> 03:07:03,930
What the fuck?

5278
03:07:06,850 --> 03:07:07,330
Damn.

5279
03:07:07,370 --> 03:07:09,050
Yeah, it looks like it's Souls game boss.

5280
03:07:11,490 --> 03:07:12,570
Oh, there he is!

5281
03:07:13,610 --> 03:07:14,090
Oh!

5282
03:07:15,510 --> 03:07:16,850
Which one is the weak point?

5283
03:07:17,330 --> 03:07:18,030
The head.

5284
03:07:18,310 --> 03:07:19,450
We'll fuck around about that.

5285
03:07:19,710 --> 03:07:20,310
It's the head.

5286
03:07:21,730 --> 03:07:22,470
Good to know.

5287
03:07:22,530 --> 03:07:22,770
Whoa!

5288
03:07:24,210 --> 03:07:28,350
It's still the head.

5289
03:07:29,210 --> 03:07:30,190
It's still the head.

5290
03:07:30,290 --> 03:07:30,610
Yeah.

5291
03:07:34,070 --> 03:07:37,670
I'm doing more damage on the side than it says the fucking critical point.

5292
03:07:38,690 --> 03:07:39,690
Oh my god.

5293
03:07:39,710 --> 03:07:42,090
I wanna hit the head with the shotgun but like...

5294
03:07:42,090 --> 03:07:43,350
Oh shit!

5295
03:07:45,550 --> 03:07:46,470
Oh my god!

5296
03:07:46,970 --> 03:07:47,950
Wait, are you...

5297
03:07:54,090 --> 03:07:55,690
Give me that!

5298
03:07:55,690 --> 03:07:59,590
Give me that!

5299
03:08:00,190 --> 03:08:00,570
Give me that!

5300
03:08:00,570 --> 03:08:01,330
Where did he go?

5301
03:08:01,330 --> 03:08:02,530
Where did he go?

5302
03:08:03,390 --> 03:08:04,550
Oh, he's up in the...

5303
03:08:04,550 --> 03:08:05,670
He has another mini gun.

5304
03:08:06,430 --> 03:08:07,430
Illuminate the spawners.

5305
03:08:07,750 --> 03:08:08,770
The spawners?

5306
03:08:08,790 --> 03:08:09,710
What does it look like?

5307
03:08:10,950 --> 03:08:12,050
It looks like an egg.

5308
03:08:12,530 --> 03:08:13,470
Oh, I see, I see it!

5309
03:08:16,230 --> 03:08:16,730
Shoot it!

5310
03:08:16,790 --> 03:08:17,410
Shoot the spawner!

5311
03:08:17,450 --> 03:08:19,050
I am!

5312
03:08:21,450 --> 03:08:22,830
Oh, he's got... We got the other spawner.

5313
03:08:23,430 --> 03:08:24,430
Oh, there he is.

5314
03:08:24,750 --> 03:08:25,330
He's back.

5315
03:08:25,650 --> 03:08:26,630
Oh, what the fuck?

5316
03:08:26,650 --> 03:08:27,250
He's TPing.

5317
03:08:29,690 --> 03:08:30,070
Okay.

5318
03:08:31,330 --> 03:08:31,550
Catch me!

5319
03:08:31,670 --> 03:08:31,990
Ow!

5320
03:08:32,350 --> 03:08:32,730
Here you go.

5321
03:08:32,770 --> 03:08:33,130
He caught me.

5322
03:08:34,190 --> 03:08:35,050
Oh my god.

5323
03:08:36,110 --> 03:08:37,070
I'm behind him.

5324
03:08:39,090 --> 03:08:39,950
That's fucking right.

5325
03:08:40,010 --> 03:08:40,530
No, I'm thirsty!

5326
03:08:41,190 --> 03:08:41,590
No!

5327
03:08:43,230 --> 03:08:45,530
No, this is the wrong time to be thirsty!

5328
03:08:49,370 --> 03:08:50,690
Drink your hot tea, you...

5329
03:08:50,690 --> 03:08:51,710
I need a hydrate!

5330
03:08:54,690 --> 03:08:56,290
It does more damage on the melee.

5331
03:08:56,570 --> 03:08:57,570
Alright, give me that!

5332
03:09:01,330 --> 03:09:02,210
I'm gonna...

5333
03:09:02,210 --> 03:09:03,370
Melee, melee, melee!

5334
03:09:03,530 --> 03:09:04,070
It's huge damage!

5335
03:09:04,510 --> 03:09:04,910
No!

5336
03:09:09,030 --> 03:09:10,150
Holy shit.

5337
03:09:10,430 --> 03:09:11,710
Holy shit.

5338
03:09:13,330 --> 03:09:14,690
I'm so fucking slow.

5339
03:09:15,270 --> 03:09:17,090
Oh my... She has a different gun now!

5340
03:09:17,270 --> 03:09:17,510
No!

5341
03:09:17,570 --> 03:09:18,330
Holy shit.

5342
03:09:18,910 --> 03:09:22,430
I used the mini gun and it destroyed the egg.

5343
03:09:22,930 --> 03:09:25,330
Holy fuck, that's so fast.

5344
03:09:26,210 --> 03:09:26,770
Yeah.

5345
03:09:27,630 --> 03:09:29,010
Alright, he's in front of you.

5346
03:09:29,010 --> 03:09:29,750
He's in front of you.

5347
03:09:29,790 --> 03:09:31,270
Oh, he's behind us.

5348
03:09:32,310 --> 03:09:33,590
He has a different gun now.

5349
03:09:33,650 --> 03:09:34,790
It's a rocket launcher!

5350
03:09:35,050 --> 03:09:35,930
Holy shit!

5351
03:09:35,930 --> 03:09:36,290
It's explosives!

5352
03:09:37,710 --> 03:09:39,490
You're just taking everything.

5353
03:09:40,730 --> 03:09:40,790
Ow.

5354
03:09:41,970 --> 03:09:43,670
Oh my god, Mono!

5355
03:09:43,670 --> 03:09:45,150
No, you're gonna die, Mono!

5356
03:09:45,170 --> 03:09:45,390
Mono!

5357
03:09:46,370 --> 03:09:46,890
Mono!

5358
03:09:49,110 --> 03:09:50,150
You're crazy!

5359
03:09:52,110 --> 03:09:53,150
You're crazy!

5360
03:09:55,630 --> 03:09:57,030
Oh my god, he reloaded.

5361
03:09:57,790 --> 03:09:58,990
Oh my god.

5362
03:09:59,070 --> 03:09:59,350
Shit.

5363
03:09:59,830 --> 03:10:02,610
Oh, where'd he go?

5364
03:10:03,030 --> 03:10:04,590
He's almost dead though.

5365
03:10:08,190 --> 03:10:08,790
Boom!

5366
03:10:10,290 --> 03:10:10,890
Okay.

5367
03:10:12,670 --> 03:10:13,270
Boom!

5368
03:10:13,430 --> 03:10:15,810
Call this RPG, I wanna shoot it!

5369
03:10:17,430 --> 03:10:18,390
I'm trying!

5370
03:10:19,170 --> 03:10:22,030
I'm gonna shoot that fucking RPG out of his hand.

5371
03:10:22,170 --> 03:10:22,370
I'm gonna shoot that fucking RPG out of his hand.

5372
03:10:22,370 --> 03:10:24,370
You wanna shoot the RPG?

5373
03:10:25,010 --> 03:10:26,470
I'm shooting the arm!

5374
03:10:26,650 --> 03:10:27,010
You know what?

5375
03:10:27,030 --> 03:10:27,830
You know what?

5376
03:10:27,830 --> 03:10:29,130
I'm gonna use a fucking axe.

5377
03:10:29,250 --> 03:10:30,510
I'm gonna use the axe!

5378
03:10:30,790 --> 03:10:32,130
I'm gonna use the pickaxe!

5379
03:10:32,250 --> 03:10:33,390
Bro, he's like 1 HP!

5380
03:10:34,250 --> 03:10:36,330
This guy's gonna die with the pickaxe.

5381
03:10:37,130 --> 03:10:37,570
Yay!

5382
03:10:37,610 --> 03:10:38,730
I killed him with the pickaxe.

5383
03:10:38,810 --> 03:10:39,970
He did it!

5384
03:10:40,590 --> 03:10:45,330
Okay, I want control max gain.

5385
03:10:47,070 --> 03:10:47,510
Whoa!

5386
03:10:47,510 --> 03:10:48,550
That's a lot of stuff.

5387
03:10:48,670 --> 03:10:49,190
I got an AK.

5388
03:10:51,150 --> 03:10:52,230
Oh wait, what's this?

5389
03:10:53,110 --> 03:10:53,870
Chastic secure?

5390
03:10:54,710 --> 03:10:55,910
Okay, do I get it?

5391
03:10:57,730 --> 03:10:58,510
I got it.

5392
03:10:59,390 --> 03:11:00,250
It's a new deviation.

5393
03:11:00,930 --> 03:11:02,850
I got a new devia- Do we get a new deviation?

5394
03:11:03,590 --> 03:11:04,070
Yeah, yeah.

5395
03:11:04,250 --> 03:11:04,910
Oh shit.

5396
03:11:05,250 --> 03:11:05,970
Okay, Motoko.

5397
03:11:06,770 --> 03:11:08,090
Thanks for- Oh I did it!

5398
03:11:08,110 --> 03:11:09,170
Oh my god, it's so cute!

5399
03:11:09,210 --> 03:11:09,790
It's like a frog!

5400
03:11:10,990 --> 03:11:11,770
It looks dumb.

5401
03:11:12,050 --> 03:11:13,050
Yeah, it looks so stupid.

5402
03:11:13,230 --> 03:11:13,390
Alright.

5403
03:11:14,110 --> 03:11:14,830
Uh, gee.

5404
03:11:15,470 --> 03:11:16,470
Are you ready to leave?

5405
03:11:16,610 --> 03:11:18,450
Wait, I'm gonna snap my fingers just in case.

5406
03:11:20,410 --> 03:11:25,830
Alright, I wanna see the- Oh my god, you're like 1 HP.

5407
03:11:27,030 --> 03:11:27,310
Yeah.

5408
03:11:29,330 --> 03:11:30,730
Oh, Motoko left.

5409
03:11:31,830 --> 03:11:36,570
Motoko- Honestly, this is a decent game.

5410
03:11:36,710 --> 03:11:41,510
Yeah, this is- I think when you get to play the bosses, the dungeons, it's actually pretty decent.

5411
03:11:41,730 --> 03:11:42,430
It's fun.

5412
03:11:42,730 --> 03:11:45,730
It doesn't feel- Well, it depends on how you play it.

5413
03:11:45,770 --> 03:11:50,170
Cause it- You know, games nowadays just kinda feel like a chore instead of playing it.

5414
03:11:50,470 --> 03:11:54,470
And just- This is- Depends on how you fuckin' play it, I guess.

5415
03:11:55,190 --> 03:11:57,330
But- Yeah, the start is too slow.

5416
03:11:57,550 --> 03:11:58,190
I agree.

5417
03:11:58,310 --> 03:11:58,550
Too slow.

5418
03:11:58,710 --> 03:12:01,650
The start to get to this part is too slow.

5419
03:12:01,870 --> 03:12:02,310
You don't have a pants.

5420
03:12:02,310 --> 03:12:03,450
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

5421
03:12:03,550 --> 03:12:05,390
I thought having no pants was the best part.

5422
03:12:06,510 --> 03:12:08,250
There's sanity gummies?

5423
03:12:08,790 --> 03:12:11,390
The ba- Uh, what does it do?

5424
03:12:11,630 --> 03:12:13,370
Oh, pl- Do I have sanity levels?

5425
03:12:13,910 --> 03:12:15,070
Where's my sanity levels?

5426
03:12:15,090 --> 03:12:15,530
Oh!

5427
03:12:15,610 --> 03:12:17,610
It's for the, uh, what do you call it?

5428
03:12:17,730 --> 03:12:18,730
The radiation.

5429
03:12:19,910 --> 03:12:20,350
Oh!

5430
03:12:20,350 --> 03:12:22,690
Yeah, cause you're getting radiation all the time.

5431
03:12:22,910 --> 03:12:23,470
It helps you.

5432
03:12:23,590 --> 03:12:24,010
Alright.

5433
03:12:26,390 --> 03:12:29,390
Find chrono cage and a monolith of greed in the basement.

5434
03:12:30,430 --> 03:12:32,050
On the- What's- Oh, it's this.

5435
03:12:33,270 --> 03:12:33,710
Investigate.

5436
03:12:35,050 --> 03:12:35,490
Investigate.

5437
03:12:35,490 --> 03:12:36,890
I'm investigating right next to you.

5438
03:12:37,610 --> 03:12:38,490
I'm investigating.

5439
03:12:45,340 --> 03:12:49,320
Yeah, the part where we actually get to shoot our gun is fun.

5440
03:12:49,460 --> 03:12:49,720
Oh!

5441
03:12:49,800 --> 03:12:50,520
What the fuck?

5442
03:12:50,520 --> 03:12:51,680
I didn't expect there's you.

5443
03:12:51,940 --> 03:12:52,780
Yeah, I'm here with you.

5444
03:12:53,560 --> 03:12:54,460
Hey, Mr. Ko.

5445
03:12:55,580 --> 03:12:56,540
I did it!

5446
03:12:56,900 --> 03:12:58,740
I don't know why I was so worried.

5447
03:12:58,740 --> 03:12:59,420
Okay.

5448
03:12:59,700 --> 03:13:00,240
Thank you.

5449
03:13:00,540 --> 03:13:01,180
It's a call.

5450
03:13:01,300 --> 03:13:02,440
This really means a lot to me.

5451
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:05,680
The fluctuations in Stardust seem to have grown calmer.

5452
03:13:05,940 --> 03:13:06,460
Yes, I did it.

5453
03:13:06,460 --> 03:13:07,580
And I feel stronger now.

5454
03:13:07,780 --> 03:13:11,060
The more deviations we contain, the more the world will stabilize.

5455
03:13:11,480 --> 03:13:13,480
And the more Mitsuko's power can grow.

5456
03:13:13,800 --> 03:13:16,420
We still have five more monoliths to shut down.

5457
03:13:16,840 --> 03:13:20,380
Until then, the physical world remains too dangerous for Mitsuko.

5458
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:24,220
Yes, but this is already a huge step forward.

5459
03:13:24,220 --> 03:13:26,040
Yeah, for chill- For chill game, it's alright.

5460
03:13:26,480 --> 03:13:27,000
Yeah!

5461
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:30,100
It's a nice, like, chill hangout game with friends.

5462
03:13:30,520 --> 03:13:31,180
Mm-hmm.

5463
03:13:33,900 --> 03:13:35,940
What about the other game?

5464
03:13:36,280 --> 03:13:37,300
What's that thing called?

5465
03:13:37,320 --> 03:13:37,720
Remnant?

5466
03:13:38,460 --> 03:13:39,520
No, no, no, no.

5467
03:13:40,700 --> 03:13:41,920
The First Descendant.

5468
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:42,540
Have you tried that?

5469
03:13:42,740 --> 03:13:43,680
The First Descendant?

5470
03:13:43,720 --> 03:13:45,820
I heard it's like Warframe and Destiny.

5471
03:13:46,280 --> 03:13:49,320
Yeah, it's Warframe, Destiny... shit.

5472
03:13:49,440 --> 03:13:49,680
Yeah,

5473
03:13:53,820 --> 03:13:53,900
it's Warframe, Destiny... shit.

5474
03:13:53,900 --> 03:13:56,880
I mean, I feel like if there was more dungeons...

5475
03:13:56,880 --> 03:13:56,980
I mean, I feel like if there was more dungeons...

5476
03:13:56,980 --> 03:14:00,300
I think people would like the dungeon part is like fun in general.

5477
03:14:00,480 --> 03:14:01,140
It is.

5478
03:14:01,280 --> 03:14:01,480
Yeah.

5479
03:14:01,740 --> 03:14:02,160
I can see.

5480
03:14:02,720 --> 03:14:04,560
Especially when you get like take their guns.

5481
03:14:04,700 --> 03:14:06,700
I thought that was fu- Oh,

5482
03:14:10,040 --> 03:14:10,940
wait, we're back here.

5483
03:14:11,840 --> 03:14:12,500
Loot time.

5484
03:14:14,340 --> 03:14:16,620
Chat, is there like another dungeon we can go straight to?

5485
03:14:16,680 --> 03:14:20,360
If there is another dungeon we can go straight to, like, I don't mind doing one more dungeon.

5486
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:21,760
Yeah, me too.

5487
03:14:21,960 --> 03:14:22,360
Yeah.

5488
03:14:22,380 --> 03:14:23,600
I just need one more.

5489
03:14:25,340 --> 03:14:25,740
Cool.

5490
03:14:25,740 --> 03:14:26,060
Hmm.

5491
03:14:26,740 --> 03:14:27,180
Snap.

5492
03:14:29,820 --> 03:14:30,620
Snapping just...

5493
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:34,720
To be fair, the story is horrible.

5494
03:14:34,900 --> 03:14:37,800
I do not think we are playing this game for the story.

5495
03:14:40,780 --> 03:14:41,940
We're just here to goof.

5496
03:14:42,560 --> 03:14:45,120
Yeah, we're just here to... we're just here to shoot our gun.

5497
03:14:46,120 --> 03:14:46,560
Snap.

5498
03:14:48,420 --> 03:14:49,440
Where are you supposed to go?

5499
03:14:49,620 --> 03:14:52,200
Open the... to unlock the bronze crafting.

5500
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:53,360
Okay, we need bronze?

5501
03:14:53,940 --> 03:14:56,040
I did that and then I have to go back to the dungeon.

5502
03:14:56,060 --> 03:14:56,920
To the personal territory?

5503
03:14:57,320 --> 03:15:00,420
Um, bronze and unlock the garage?

5504
03:15:01,580 --> 03:15:02,420
Wait, where's the bronze?

5505
03:15:02,420 --> 03:15:03,040
I have a garage already.

5506
03:15:03,440 --> 03:15:04,180
What the fuck?

5507
03:15:04,220 --> 03:15:04,980
How did you have all that?

5508
03:15:05,780 --> 03:15:06,920
Because I don't know.

5509
03:15:07,160 --> 03:15:08,120
My bike broke.

5510
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:09,060
I need to make it.

5511
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:09,680
Oh.

5512
03:15:09,800 --> 03:15:10,660
Secure for starting journey.

5513
03:15:10,700 --> 03:15:11,300
Securement unit.

5514
03:15:12,120 --> 03:15:16,620
Can I have two securemen- uh, hold on.

5515
03:15:16,880 --> 03:15:17,580
And unlock everything?

5516
03:15:17,820 --> 03:15:21,540
And then you unlock, open, and unlock the garage?

5517
03:15:21,560 --> 03:15:22,620
I can make more than two.

5518
03:15:22,800 --> 03:15:23,300
That's cool.

5519
03:15:23,300 --> 03:15:25,000
I need to open the garage?

5520
03:15:25,140 --> 03:15:26,240
Where the fuck's the garage?

5521
03:15:27,740 --> 03:15:28,980
In my garage.

5522
03:15:29,580 --> 03:15:31,340
I'm still thirsty?

5523
03:15:31,540 --> 03:15:32,800
Why am I always thirsty?

5524
03:15:34,820 --> 03:15:37,260
Why am I still thirsty?

5525
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:40,460
Okay, there's the garage.

5526
03:15:44,940 --> 03:15:47,200
Okay, back to the personal territory.

5527
03:15:47,380 --> 03:15:47,680
Okay.

5528
03:15:48,180 --> 03:15:50,160
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna TP.

5529
03:15:51,620 --> 03:15:52,640
You know shit.

5530
03:15:52,640 --> 03:15:53,200
Yeah.

5531
03:15:54,500 --> 03:15:55,440
TP time.

5532
03:16:00,820 --> 03:16:01,460
Alright.

5533
03:16:01,940 --> 03:16:03,400
Alright, number six.

5534
03:16:03,500 --> 03:16:04,580
Get back in here.

5535
03:16:06,060 --> 03:16:07,080
Number six.

5536
03:16:07,440 --> 03:16:09,280
Number six, get back into the team.

5537
03:16:12,770 --> 03:16:13,710
Number six.

5538
03:16:15,950 --> 03:16:17,030
Oh my god!

5539
03:16:17,690 --> 03:16:19,070
97%!

5540
03:16:19,330 --> 03:16:20,610
We're almost there!

5541
03:16:22,370 --> 03:16:24,090
Number six, you're doing great.

5542
03:16:25,290 --> 03:16:26,410
Okay, let's see.

5543
03:16:27,870 --> 03:16:28,190
I need enough?

5544
03:16:28,490 --> 03:16:29,130
I need glass.

5545
03:16:29,390 --> 03:16:30,590
Okay, I need ten glass.

5546
03:16:31,230 --> 03:16:33,090
Okay, I'm gonna mooch off your furnace.

5547
03:16:33,190 --> 03:16:33,790
Yeah, 97.

5548
03:16:37,210 --> 03:16:38,990
Okay, we need to invite number six.

5549
03:16:39,430 --> 03:16:41,210
Can you invite number six into our group?

5550
03:16:41,750 --> 03:16:42,750
I think you can.

5551
03:16:43,030 --> 03:16:43,990
Oh, I have to do it?

5552
03:16:44,770 --> 03:16:45,350
Okay, hi.

5553
03:16:45,750 --> 03:16:46,450
I invited him.

5554
03:16:46,610 --> 03:16:47,050
Okay.

5555
03:16:47,510 --> 03:16:47,950
Nice.

5556
03:16:50,270 --> 03:16:50,710
Alright.

5557
03:16:51,770 --> 03:16:53,410
Uh, I need to use your furnace.

5558
03:16:54,270 --> 03:16:56,330
I'm too lazy to make my own furnace.

5559
03:16:56,570 --> 03:16:57,030
The fuck?!

5560
03:16:59,270 --> 03:17:01,190
What do you mean, what the fuck?

5561
03:17:03,390 --> 03:17:06,470
You have a furnace, so I need to use it!

5562
03:17:06,990 --> 03:17:07,530
Right.

5563
03:17:08,590 --> 03:17:09,510
You might as well.

5564
03:17:09,510 --> 03:17:10,510
We're sharing this.

5565
03:17:12,050 --> 03:17:13,070
Uh-huh.

5566
03:17:14,250 --> 03:17:15,970
Okay, I need like nine glass.

5567
03:17:16,230 --> 03:17:20,870
I wanna put the other guy... I wanna put the slime guy in my backpack.

5568
03:17:22,790 --> 03:17:23,350
Weee.

5569
03:17:24,010 --> 03:17:27,850
Is there another dungeon that's not story related that we can just like run to?

5570
03:17:27,850 --> 03:17:28,470
There.

5571
03:17:28,830 --> 03:17:29,770
Is it in there?

5572
03:17:30,350 --> 03:17:31,730
Oh my god, it is!

5573
03:17:31,790 --> 03:17:32,350
I see him!

5574
03:17:32,490 --> 03:17:33,550
Oh my god, he's so ugly!

5575
03:17:33,750 --> 03:17:34,430
Look at him!

5576
03:17:34,910 --> 03:17:36,110
I don't see him!

5577
03:17:36,130 --> 03:17:36,330
What?

5578
03:17:36,430 --> 03:17:36,750
Come on!

5579
03:17:36,750 --> 03:17:37,750
He's so ugly!

5580
03:17:37,870 --> 03:17:39,690
He looks like he has googly eyes on!

5581
03:17:42,570 --> 03:17:44,570
What an ugly little guy!

5582
03:17:44,830 --> 03:17:45,530
Look at him!

5583
03:17:49,230 --> 03:17:49,990
Ugly baby!

5584
03:17:51,510 --> 03:17:52,170
Baby man!

5585
03:17:52,190 --> 03:17:52,690
He's in my bag!

5586
03:17:53,030 --> 03:17:53,610
Baby man!

5587
03:17:53,750 --> 03:17:55,530
Wait, I wanna see, I wanna see what does he look like.

5588
03:17:56,490 --> 03:17:57,830
Oh my... what the...

5589
03:17:57,850 --> 03:17:58,310
What the fuck?

5590
03:17:58,770 --> 03:17:59,710
He looks stupid.

5591
03:17:59,710 --> 03:18:00,130
What the fuck?

5592
03:18:01,430 --> 03:18:03,570
He looks... I swear he looks so stupid.

5593
03:18:03,610 --> 03:18:05,410
He looks so stupid.

5594
03:18:07,610 --> 03:18:09,230
I'm gonna put him in my backpack too.

5595
03:18:10,710 --> 03:18:12,310
Look at that baby man.

5596
03:18:16,410 --> 03:18:16,970
Okay.

5597
03:18:17,850 --> 03:18:19,150
What about the other one?

5598
03:18:20,790 --> 03:18:22,310
Yeah, put the disco ball.

5599
03:18:22,470 --> 03:18:22,690
Disco ball.

5600
03:18:22,690 --> 03:18:26,410
Yeah, I don't see it.

5601
03:18:26,410 --> 03:18:27,410
Why is it not...

5602
03:18:27,410 --> 03:18:27,950
Like visible?

5603
03:18:28,110 --> 03:18:28,630
What the fuck?

5604
03:18:28,830 --> 03:18:29,190
Alright.

5605
03:18:29,330 --> 03:18:30,350
Well, there you go.

5606
03:18:30,730 --> 03:18:32,030
Talk to Samuel Logue.

5607
03:18:32,050 --> 03:18:32,690
What does he do?

5608
03:18:32,930 --> 03:18:34,970
Upon being thrown, it knocks back.

5609
03:18:35,010 --> 03:18:35,910
Oh, I can throw it?

5610
03:18:36,270 --> 03:18:37,890
What the fuck?

5611
03:18:38,670 --> 03:18:40,910
Oh, it like blocks attacks apparently.

5612
03:18:43,210 --> 03:18:44,030
Look at this ugly baby.

5613
03:18:44,030 --> 03:18:46,270
Turn off world chat this whole fucking time.

5614
03:18:46,890 --> 03:18:48,670
Why would you wanna turn off world chat?

5615
03:18:49,050 --> 03:18:51,810
He makes a wall and it heals when you use him.

5616
03:18:51,870 --> 03:18:52,210
Oh!

5617
03:18:52,990 --> 03:18:53,910
That's so good!

5618
03:18:54,690 --> 03:18:55,390
That's good.

5619
03:18:55,390 --> 03:18:58,450
I like how somebody was like, I don't want to join your team.

5620
03:19:01,090 --> 03:19:01,530
Alright.

5621
03:19:01,690 --> 03:19:06,390
Is there like a dungeon that we can go without having to do the story, guys?

5622
03:19:08,490 --> 03:19:11,150
There is a dungeon I can do it right now.

5623
03:19:12,550 --> 03:19:13,850
Where was it anyway?

5624
03:19:14,010 --> 03:19:15,210
Was it Monolith of Grief?

5625
03:19:15,390 --> 03:19:16,410
Was that the one we did?

5626
03:19:17,110 --> 03:19:18,570
The Monolith of Greed?

5627
03:19:19,210 --> 03:19:20,430
That's what we did, yes.

5628
03:19:20,430 --> 03:19:22,810
So, it should be like anything like Monolith related.

5629
03:19:22,810 --> 03:19:25,350
It's basically like the dungeons.

5630
03:19:26,270 --> 03:19:26,850
Yep.

5631
03:19:27,910 --> 03:19:29,310
There's one that's level 15.

5632
03:19:30,650 --> 03:19:33,130
The Monolith Danger Zone.

5633
03:19:33,230 --> 03:19:34,950
I'm not even level 10 yet.

5634
03:19:35,110 --> 03:19:35,450
You know?

5635
03:19:39,010 --> 03:19:42,550
I know it's crazy, but I'm not even level 10 yet.

5636
03:19:42,630 --> 03:19:43,130
I'm thirsty.

5637
03:19:43,450 --> 03:19:47,970
Oh, we have to activate all these Monoliths to access one of them.

5638
03:19:48,230 --> 03:19:48,670
Oh!

5639
03:19:49,570 --> 03:19:50,790
I get it!

5640
03:19:51,190 --> 03:19:52,110
So, you see...

5641
03:19:52,110 --> 03:19:54,490
Remember when we were activating Monoliths and stuff?

5642
03:19:55,270 --> 03:20:03,650
And then, when you activate all of these anchors, like the Rift Anchor, it summons one Monolith to do a dungeon.

5643
03:20:05,630 --> 03:20:06,590
I see.

5644
03:20:08,250 --> 03:20:08,730
Oh!

5645
03:20:08,730 --> 03:20:09,930
I see now.

5646
03:20:10,830 --> 03:20:12,710
Yeah, I don't think I'm going to do that.

5647
03:20:14,930 --> 03:20:16,390
We had a good time.

5648
03:20:16,510 --> 03:20:18,150
We played this a lot longer than I thought.

5649
03:20:18,690 --> 03:20:20,170
Yeah, we lasted three hours.

5650
03:20:20,170 --> 03:20:21,410
Yeah, we lasted three hours.

5651
03:20:21,410 --> 03:20:22,630
That was pretty good for us.

5652
03:20:22,790 --> 03:20:23,270
Yeah.

5653
03:20:24,590 --> 03:20:27,790
For an FPS person who has a very short span of attention.

5654
03:20:27,790 --> 03:20:28,570
For attention span.

5655
03:20:29,270 --> 03:20:29,790
Yeah.

5656
03:20:30,890 --> 03:20:33,770
Yeah, honestly, not bad.

5657
03:20:34,010 --> 03:20:35,090
Honestly, it looks decent.

5658
03:20:35,290 --> 03:20:36,590
Yeah, let's check out numbers...

5659
03:20:36,590 --> 03:20:37,510
These kind of mechanics.

5660
03:20:37,870 --> 03:20:38,950
Number 6's work.

5661
03:20:39,290 --> 03:20:40,510
Come on, Tengen, let's go.

5662
03:20:41,190 --> 03:20:42,090
Is it done?

5663
03:20:43,370 --> 03:20:45,330
I'm pretty sure... it's 90... 97.

5664
03:20:45,430 --> 03:20:46,150
You know what?

5665
03:20:46,510 --> 03:20:47,630
It's almost done.

5666
03:20:48,070 --> 03:20:48,950
It's good enough.

5667
03:20:48,950 --> 03:20:50,470
It's missing a beam.

5668
03:20:50,790 --> 03:20:52,070
There, I fixed it.

5669
03:20:52,210 --> 03:20:52,770
98.

5670
03:20:52,870 --> 03:20:52,890
It's done.

5671
03:20:53,030 --> 03:20:53,630
It's 98.

5672
03:20:54,570 --> 03:20:56,490
And then it's missing a window.

5673
03:20:56,850 --> 03:20:59,030
It's missing one window or something.

5674
03:20:59,610 --> 03:21:01,830
Yeah, it's missing one window on top.

5675
03:21:03,230 --> 03:21:04,190
Oh, it is!

5676
03:21:04,470 --> 03:21:05,390
Wait, do you have it?

5677
03:21:05,790 --> 03:21:06,890
I don't have a glass.

5678
03:21:07,130 --> 03:21:08,630
No, none of us have glass.

5679
03:21:09,410 --> 03:21:10,530
Literally 2%.

5680
03:21:12,110 --> 03:21:14,250
It's missing one window.

5681
03:21:15,170 --> 03:21:15,730
And...

5682
03:21:15,730 --> 03:21:16,390
He just...

5683
03:21:17,330 --> 03:21:17,890
He...

5684
03:21:19,450 --> 03:21:20,310
He made...

5685
03:21:20,310 --> 03:21:21,710
Because the stair...

5686
03:21:21,710 --> 03:21:25,330
Okay, essentially it's done since the stair is bugged and cannot be built.

5687
03:21:25,410 --> 03:21:26,850
He built a different kind of stair.

5688
03:21:26,890 --> 03:21:27,290
Look at this.

5689
03:21:27,430 --> 03:21:28,010
Look at this.

5690
03:21:30,050 --> 03:21:32,690
He made a different fucking kind of stair.

5691
03:21:32,710 --> 03:21:33,390
That's smart.

5692
03:21:34,730 --> 03:21:35,990
We did it!

5693
03:21:36,890 --> 03:21:37,390
Yeah!

5694
03:21:38,110 --> 03:21:38,650
Guys!

5695
03:21:38,670 --> 03:21:40,370
It's just missing this window right here.

5696
03:21:40,650 --> 03:21:41,990
Guys, we did it!

5697
03:21:42,430 --> 03:21:44,070
Guys, we finished the game!

5698
03:21:44,990 --> 03:21:45,870
Holy shit.

5699
03:21:45,890 --> 03:21:47,830
Look at how tall my house is!

5700
03:21:48,030 --> 03:21:48,930
Honestly, the world is nice.

5701
03:21:48,930 --> 03:21:50,510
It is beautiful when it's fucking daytime.

5702
03:21:50,730 --> 03:21:51,250
What the fuck?

5703
03:21:52,210 --> 03:21:53,830
Number 6 did it!

5704
03:21:55,190 --> 03:21:56,390
Oh, it's...

5705
03:21:56,390 --> 03:21:58,630
Congratulations, number 6!

5706
03:21:59,390 --> 03:21:59,510
Look at that.

5707
03:21:59,510 --> 03:22:00,150
What did he do?

5708
03:22:00,430 --> 03:22:07,850
He gets the pride of having a Finnish house in a game that may or may not die in a month.

5709
03:22:08,710 --> 03:22:09,730
Don't say that.

5710
03:22:12,690 --> 03:22:13,290
It's...

5711
03:22:13,290 --> 03:22:13,570
It's...

5712
03:22:16,410 --> 03:22:17,010
It's...

5713
03:22:17,010 --> 03:22:17,210
It's...

5714
03:22:17,210 --> 03:22:17,910
It's...

5715
03:22:17,910 --> 03:22:18,290
It's...

5716
03:22:18,290 --> 03:22:18,430
It's...

5717
03:22:18,430 --> 03:22:18,550
It's...

5718
03:22:49,550 --> 03:22:51,510
You have the power to fight back.

5719
03:22:51,650 --> 03:22:52,470
I don't.

5720
03:22:53,490 --> 03:22:55,350
What do you mean you're indie?

5721
03:22:56,090 --> 03:22:57,130
What do you mean?

5722
03:22:58,310 --> 03:22:58,950
You're indie.

5723
03:22:59,170 --> 03:23:00,010
You wanna see?

5724
03:23:00,130 --> 03:23:01,410
You wanna speak to the alligator?

5725
03:23:02,010 --> 03:23:02,970
You're indie.

5726
03:23:03,250 --> 03:23:03,850
What do you mean?

5727
03:23:04,330 --> 03:23:05,470
You're speaking to the alligator?

5728
03:23:06,330 --> 03:23:08,130
Oh my god, look at him.

5729
03:23:08,190 --> 03:23:09,850
Why does he have like a backpack?

5730
03:23:10,110 --> 03:23:10,870
What is that?

5731
03:23:10,930 --> 03:23:11,570
Oh no, it's not.

5732
03:23:11,610 --> 03:23:12,810
It's just like...

5733
03:23:13,650 --> 03:23:14,130
Hello.

5734
03:23:14,130 --> 03:23:15,010
Hello, guys.

5735
03:23:18,590 --> 03:23:19,370
Oh yeah.

5736
03:23:19,610 --> 03:23:19,970
He's chill.

5737
03:23:20,030 --> 03:23:21,070
He's so chill now.

5738
03:23:22,390 --> 03:23:22,890
Ow!

5739
03:23:23,730 --> 03:23:25,710
Oh, he's not chill now.

5740
03:23:26,430 --> 03:23:27,490
Are you scared?

5741
03:23:27,490 --> 03:23:28,430
You just had to say it.

5742
03:23:28,530 --> 03:23:29,650
Dungeon, why are you scared?

5743
03:23:29,770 --> 03:23:30,890
What are you scared about?

5744
03:23:31,350 --> 03:23:31,730
I'm not.

5745
03:23:31,950 --> 03:23:32,170
I'm not.

5746
03:23:32,170 --> 03:23:33,250
Just speak your mind.

5747
03:23:34,730 --> 03:23:35,230
Uh...

5748
03:23:35,230 --> 03:23:36,830
I wish I'm happy.

5749
03:23:38,510 --> 03:23:39,010
Ow!

5750
03:23:42,230 --> 03:23:42,730
Fuck.

5751
03:23:42,730 --> 03:23:45,990
Speak your mind about this game.

5752
03:23:47,370 --> 03:23:48,530
Speak my mind about...

5753
03:23:48,550 --> 03:23:49,050
Um...

5754
03:23:49,310 --> 03:23:51,070
Well, honestly, again, it's...

5755
03:23:51,070 --> 03:23:51,850
It's okay.

5756
03:23:52,250 --> 03:23:52,910
The game's okay.

5757
03:23:53,230 --> 03:23:55,350
But I don't know if it'll last long.

5758
03:23:55,450 --> 03:23:56,230
You need to deal with it.

5759
03:23:56,710 --> 03:23:58,350
But then, let's just be honest.

5760
03:23:59,510 --> 03:24:00,590
There we go.

5761
03:24:01,010 --> 03:24:02,910
It's not too hard.

5762
03:24:03,150 --> 03:24:04,070
Alright, goodbye.

5763
03:24:05,790 --> 03:24:06,890
Goodbye, alligator.

5764
03:24:08,050 --> 03:24:08,570
Goodbye.

5765
03:24:09,310 --> 03:24:09,450
Die.

5766
03:24:09,610 --> 03:24:10,770
You die now.

5767
03:24:10,870 --> 03:24:12,150
We're gonna eat you up.

5768
03:24:12,350 --> 03:24:13,310
Om nom nom.

5769
03:24:13,990 --> 03:24:14,990
Nom nom nom.

5770
03:24:15,450 --> 03:24:16,350
You ever had alligator meat?

5771
03:24:16,350 --> 03:24:17,610
Uh, no, I don't...

5772
03:24:17,610 --> 03:24:18,270
Wait, have you?

5773
03:24:18,490 --> 03:24:19,930
Are there alligators in Indonesia?

5774
03:24:21,090 --> 03:24:21,610
I had.

5775
03:24:21,870 --> 03:24:21,970
I had.

5776
03:24:22,070 --> 03:24:23,690
Wait, there's alligators in Indonesia?

5777
03:24:24,910 --> 03:24:25,310
Crocodiles.

5778
03:24:25,590 --> 03:24:26,670
Yeah, that's not alligator.

5779
03:24:27,870 --> 03:24:29,070
Well, it's the same shit.

5780
03:24:29,330 --> 03:24:30,210
Just different smells.

5781
03:24:30,630 --> 03:24:31,350
What is this?

5782
03:24:32,350 --> 03:24:33,010
I want to build...

5783
03:24:33,010 --> 03:24:33,730
Okay, I summon them.

5784
03:24:34,010 --> 03:24:34,650
Look at him!

5785
03:24:35,090 --> 03:24:36,330
Oh my god, look guys!

5786
03:24:36,430 --> 03:24:37,290
It's Call of Duty!

5787
03:24:38,390 --> 03:24:39,190
Holy shit.

5788
03:24:39,330 --> 03:24:39,710
You can...

5789
03:24:39,710 --> 03:24:40,170
Oh my...

5790
03:24:40,170 --> 03:24:41,190
Honestly, this guy...

5791
03:24:41,190 --> 03:24:42,930
I can see he's more of a PvP.

5792
03:24:43,370 --> 03:24:45,350
I can see he's more of a PvP.

5793
03:24:45,610 --> 03:24:45,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5794
03:24:45,930 --> 03:24:46,330
He's more of a PvP.

5795
03:24:46,330 --> 03:24:47,130
He looks so dumb!

5796
03:24:47,230 --> 03:24:48,850
He looks so dumb, I swear to god.

5797
03:24:49,030 --> 03:24:50,950
He looks super fucking dumb.

5798
03:24:51,210 --> 03:24:52,270
What the fuck?

5799
03:24:52,270 --> 03:24:54,090
I swear he looks super fucking dumb.

5800
03:24:54,510 --> 03:24:55,790
I wait, summon yours!

5801
03:24:57,290 --> 03:24:58,130
I don't have...

5802
03:24:58,130 --> 03:24:59,370
Oh, I'm not using that shit.

5803
03:24:59,470 --> 03:25:00,390
You don't have...

5804
03:25:01,950 --> 03:25:04,910
Oh my god, why does this guy exist?

5805
03:25:06,090 --> 03:25:07,530
Like, oh my god.

5806
03:25:07,770 --> 03:25:08,650
It's Call of Duty.

5807
03:25:11,030 --> 03:25:15,650
So I was like, he's so skew- Alright, let's see.

5808
03:25:15,690 --> 03:25:16,310
Secure it.

5809
03:25:17,530 --> 03:25:18,330
Flawless fortification?

5810
03:25:18,510 --> 03:25:19,230
Build fortification?

5811
03:25:19,690 --> 03:25:21,010
I don't remember which one I threw.

5812
03:25:21,110 --> 03:25:22,030
I threw the one on the right.

5813
03:25:24,470 --> 03:25:25,150
Oh my god.

5814
03:25:25,510 --> 03:25:26,190
There we go.

5815
03:25:26,530 --> 03:25:27,430
The face is here.

5816
03:25:27,550 --> 03:25:27,950
Whoa!

5817
03:25:29,250 --> 03:25:30,370
You can throw him!

5818
03:25:30,910 --> 03:25:31,310
Yeah!

5819
03:25:31,670 --> 03:25:34,250
Yeah, you can throw him and then I can be like...

5820
03:25:36,050 --> 03:25:37,370
Oh, and then he's gone.

5821
03:25:37,690 --> 03:25:38,410
He's gone.

5822
03:25:39,130 --> 03:25:39,810
He looks so dumb.

5823
03:25:40,010 --> 03:25:41,070
I swear, he is so dumb.

5824
03:25:42,370 --> 03:25:43,290
Oh my god.

5825
03:25:43,290 --> 03:25:44,990
Yeah, he looks like a good for PvP.

5826
03:25:45,190 --> 03:25:46,190
That was fun though.

5827
03:25:46,270 --> 03:25:46,310
I'm not sure if I can get him.

5828
03:25:46,310 --> 03:25:46,890
That was fun.

5829
03:25:47,050 --> 03:25:48,810
Like, I'm glad I did not do the solo.

5830
03:25:49,150 --> 03:25:52,710
I'm going to- You didn't have to suffer a game for a while.

5831
03:25:52,710 --> 03:25:55,930
I think if I played the solo, I would not have made it to the boss.

5832
03:25:56,270 --> 03:25:58,150
You would not have figured out the game.

5833
03:25:58,310 --> 03:25:58,530
Yeah.

5834
03:26:00,650 --> 03:26:03,270
Tengen has helped me figure out the game.

5835
03:26:06,590 --> 03:26:07,450
GG's, Tengen.

5836
03:26:07,510 --> 03:26:08,910
We're three hours of sleep.

5837
03:26:09,830 --> 03:26:10,270
GG's.

5838
03:26:10,310 --> 03:26:11,430
Oh yeah, that's true.

5839
03:26:11,530 --> 03:26:11,790
GG's.

5840
03:26:11,790 --> 03:26:13,870
You were using your head more than me.

5841
03:26:13,990 --> 03:26:14,270
Yes.

5842
03:26:14,270 --> 03:26:15,830
Even though you had three hours of sleep.

5843
03:26:16,430 --> 03:26:21,350
You know, I remember correctly you asked to play X-Deviant.

5844
03:26:21,410 --> 03:26:23,930
I don't know what the fuck happened to that, but now it's here.

5845
03:26:23,930 --> 03:26:24,070
Oh yeah, yeah.

5846
03:26:24,290 --> 03:26:27,290
Because like, you know, X-Deviant was...

5847
03:26:27,910 --> 03:26:30,330
X-Deviant has already died, so...

5848
03:26:30,330 --> 03:26:31,770
Oh, I see.

5849
03:26:31,950 --> 03:26:32,590
That's funny.

5850
03:26:34,950 --> 03:26:37,330
So I was like, yo, let's just check out this game.

5851
03:26:37,350 --> 03:26:37,830
It's launching.

5852
03:26:37,830 --> 03:26:38,950
And it's free too.

5853
03:26:39,310 --> 03:26:39,950
You know.

5854
03:26:40,210 --> 03:26:41,870
X-Deviant is also free?

5855
03:26:42,550 --> 03:26:44,610
Yeah, but like, this game is new.

5856
03:26:44,670 --> 03:26:45,670
It literally launched today.

5857
03:26:45,850 --> 03:26:46,290
Oh my god.

5858
03:26:46,310 --> 03:26:46,810
Yeah.

5859
03:26:48,510 --> 03:26:48,950
Totally.

5860
03:26:49,350 --> 03:26:50,350
Like, it just launched.

5861
03:26:50,430 --> 03:26:51,690
Not today, but like...

5862
03:26:51,690 --> 03:26:52,190
Don't...

5863
03:26:52,190 --> 03:26:53,350
But like, eight hours ago.

5864
03:26:53,550 --> 03:26:54,530
Guys, when was the last...

5865
03:26:54,530 --> 03:26:55,190
Guys, chat.

5866
03:26:55,270 --> 03:26:57,630
When was the last time you watched a streamer play X-Deviant?

5867
03:26:57,630 --> 03:26:58,410
Don't lie to me.

5868
03:27:01,230 --> 03:27:01,950
You know what?

5869
03:27:02,010 --> 03:27:02,570
You're so right.

5870
03:27:05,450 --> 03:27:07,930
Dude, like, I can say this with confidence.

5871
03:27:08,210 --> 03:27:10,510
There's more Tarkov streamers than X-Deviant.

5872
03:27:10,770 --> 03:27:11,210
Whoa!

5873
03:27:12,890 --> 03:27:16,290
Despite the Tarkov and the Tarkov...

5874
03:27:16,290 --> 03:27:17,570
Got cancelled.

5875
03:27:17,730 --> 03:27:19,970
It still has more players.

5876
03:27:20,150 --> 03:27:21,370
That's a little sad.

5877
03:27:24,270 --> 03:27:27,150
Honestly, if X-Deviant had a better server, probably.

5878
03:27:30,950 --> 03:27:35,550
Wow, I mean, a lot of games are basically, if they have better servers, it could be good.

5879
03:27:35,990 --> 03:27:36,470
True.

5880
03:27:36,850 --> 03:27:37,330
Yeah.

5881
03:27:37,950 --> 03:27:40,790
It's just, you know, they just didn't put enough resources into it.

5882
03:27:41,790 --> 03:27:44,390
But even then, I don't think there's been...

5883
03:27:45,290 --> 03:27:53,390
I mean, we haven't had a game that's been, like, that's done well in the last four years, I think?

5884
03:27:53,670 --> 03:27:54,230
Five.

5885
03:27:55,530 --> 03:28:04,310
In the last four to five years, we haven't had a shooter game that's done well that was gonna be, like, the next big video game.

5886
03:28:04,610 --> 03:28:05,170
Like...

5887
03:28:06,810 --> 03:28:08,110
I'm pretty sure.

5888
03:28:08,390 --> 03:28:09,150
Yeah, they all tried to claim that shit.

5889
03:28:09,190 --> 03:28:09,550
I can't...

5890
03:28:09,550 --> 03:28:10,990
What was the last one?

5891
03:28:11,330 --> 03:28:12,370
I think Apex.

5892
03:28:12,430 --> 03:28:13,770
Apex was the last one.

5893
03:28:13,850 --> 03:28:14,370
And I think...

5894
03:28:14,390 --> 03:28:18,310
And then Rem Royale almost was, like, the next big thing, and then they killed it.

5895
03:28:19,070 --> 03:28:19,490
Yeah.

5896
03:28:19,730 --> 03:28:25,370
The Rem Royale was at the same level as Apex at one point, and then they killed Rem Royale.

5897
03:28:26,570 --> 03:28:26,990
Because...

5898
03:28:26,990 --> 03:28:28,770
Well, Overwatch is pretty huge, I guess, right now.

5899
03:28:28,770 --> 03:28:30,130
Overwatch has been around for so long.

5900
03:28:30,250 --> 03:28:30,990
That's the thing, though.

5901
03:28:31,030 --> 03:28:32,130
Yeah, but it's been for a long...

5902
03:28:32,130 --> 03:28:33,050
Oh, wait, Valorant!

5903
03:28:33,190 --> 03:28:35,110
Valorant was the last next big...

5904
03:28:35,110 --> 03:28:37,130
Yeah, Valorant was the last game.

5905
03:28:37,190 --> 03:28:39,550
Valorant is kind of dying, to be honest.

5906
03:28:39,770 --> 03:28:41,170
I haven't even touched that game.

5907
03:28:41,730 --> 03:28:42,770
Because the direction of the game is kind of...

5908
03:28:42,770 --> 03:28:43,690
Valorant is mostly about cosmetics.

5909
03:28:43,950 --> 03:28:44,370
It's the last game.

5910
03:28:44,390 --> 03:28:47,070
Yeah, but it's a lie because of cosmetics and the eSports scene.

5911
03:28:47,950 --> 03:28:48,930
ESports scene?

5912
03:28:49,050 --> 03:28:50,770
Bro, it's fucking Bumble.

5913
03:28:50,970 --> 03:28:52,990
It's fucking eDate app.

5914
03:28:53,210 --> 03:28:53,510
No!

5915
03:28:53,610 --> 03:28:54,310
It's where you find...

5916
03:28:54,310 --> 03:28:54,670
Yeah.

5917
03:28:54,850 --> 03:28:57,410
And that's why Overwatch was so successful.

5918
03:28:58,270 --> 03:28:58,870
Right.

5919
03:28:59,030 --> 03:28:59,630
I forgot about that.

5920
03:28:59,630 --> 03:29:01,210
Overwatch walked so Valorant could run.

5921
03:29:01,550 --> 03:29:02,750
I forgot about that.

5922
03:29:02,910 --> 03:29:03,370
Sorry.

5923
03:29:03,530 --> 03:29:04,130
Overwatch.

5924
03:29:04,310 --> 03:29:05,050
Oh, my God.

5925
03:29:05,130 --> 03:29:05,950
You reminded me of stuff that I don't remember.

5926
03:29:05,950 --> 03:29:11,730
Overwatch walked for the eDating scene so Valorant could fucking sprint to the finish line.

5927
03:29:11,910 --> 03:29:12,830
Oh, my God.

5928
03:29:12,910 --> 03:29:14,370
Overwatch walked for the eDating scene so Valorant could fucking sprint to the finish I forgot about that.

5929
03:29:14,370 --> 03:29:18,490
Overwatch created the eCouple pet names for accounts.

5930
03:29:18,910 --> 03:29:19,270
Oh, my God.

5931
03:29:19,270 --> 03:29:19,790
What was it?

5932
03:29:19,790 --> 03:29:20,450
What was it?

5933
03:29:20,450 --> 03:29:21,590
Kitten and...

5934
03:29:22,050 --> 03:29:22,910
I don't remember.

5935
03:29:23,250 --> 03:29:29,570
The Mercy players would be Kitten and then the DPS player would be like Daddy.

5936
03:29:30,970 --> 03:29:31,790
Oh, my God.

5937
03:29:32,330 --> 03:29:33,390
I hate this.

5938
03:29:34,630 --> 03:29:36,230
I hate this.

5939
03:29:36,950 --> 03:29:38,390
They would have...

5940
03:29:40,910 --> 03:29:43,370
You hate it because it's true.

5941
03:29:43,630 --> 03:29:44,350
I hate this.

5942
03:29:44,370 --> 03:29:46,550
You hate it because it's true.

5943
03:29:46,630 --> 03:29:47,990
Yeah, I hate it because it's true.

5944
03:29:48,010 --> 03:29:48,550
Of course.

5945
03:29:48,690 --> 03:29:49,050
You know?

5946
03:29:52,130 --> 03:29:52,770
No.

5947
03:29:53,910 --> 03:29:56,650
Guys, it started on Overwatch.

5948
03:29:56,990 --> 03:29:59,450
It did not start on Discord.

5949
03:30:02,170 --> 03:30:03,450
I mean...

5950
03:30:04,390 --> 03:30:05,550
When was Overwatch?

5951
03:30:05,750 --> 03:30:06,130
2016?

5952
03:30:07,350 --> 03:30:08,970
2016, I think so.

5953
03:30:09,010 --> 03:30:09,270
Yeah.

5954
03:30:09,790 --> 03:30:10,430
Yeah.

5955
03:30:10,830 --> 03:30:11,110
Yeah.

5956
03:30:11,350 --> 03:30:11,510
Yeah.

5957
03:30:11,790 --> 03:30:12,310
Yeah.

5958
03:30:13,670 --> 03:30:14,310
Yeah.

5959
03:30:16,370 --> 03:30:26,310
Yeah, you know like Overwatch and then they did the workshop thing and then people did the Overwatch workshop and then added Tinder on Overwatch.

5960
03:30:28,950 --> 03:30:31,110
I'm tired of this, this is stupid.

5961
03:30:36,510 --> 03:30:45,830
People would be like, ew, Valorant created the cringe e-dating account names, but it was Overwatch that started it.

5962
03:30:45,890 --> 03:30:50,210
With the Mercy and Flash DPS duos.

5963
03:30:50,270 --> 03:30:56,130
Wasn't there a certain website that's like, Overwatch has the most searched fucking result?

5964
03:30:56,310 --> 03:30:59,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because of like SFM.

5965
03:30:59,530 --> 03:31:00,290
Yep.

5966
03:31:01,190 --> 03:31:01,970
That's insane.

5967
03:31:03,090 --> 03:31:03,990
Honestly insane.

5968
03:31:05,530 --> 03:31:06,330
Holy shit.

5969
03:31:07,030 --> 03:31:08,190
Way to go community.

5970
03:31:08,670 --> 03:31:10,230
I used to believe it.

5971
03:31:10,550 --> 03:31:11,770
RuneScape did it before.

5972
03:31:11,850 --> 03:31:15,050
RuneScape was like, was like a, what's the word?

5973
03:31:16,330 --> 03:31:19,710
RuneScape was more of a niche, but Overwatch made it mainstream.

5974
03:31:20,490 --> 03:31:21,730
I'm just a merchant.

5975
03:31:22,950 --> 03:31:29,310
RuneScape, like the e-couple dating scene in RuneScape was a niche, but in Overwatch it was a lifestyle.

5976
03:31:31,110 --> 03:31:33,470
Like, it means you're good at the game kind of shit.

5977
03:31:35,530 --> 03:31:45,150
The fucking LFG look, Mercy main looking for DPS player.

5978
03:31:45,810 --> 03:31:48,190
Oh my god, the global chat.

5979
03:31:48,310 --> 03:31:48,430
You have the LFG?

5980
03:31:48,590 --> 03:31:50,170
The LFG.

5981
03:31:51,350 --> 03:31:52,710
The global chat.

5982
03:31:52,730 --> 03:31:54,670
Stop reminding me of global chat.

5983
03:31:56,030 --> 03:31:56,670
Fuck.

5984
03:31:58,790 --> 03:31:59,430
Fuck.

5985
03:31:59,430 --> 03:32:00,510
Oh man.

5986
03:32:03,370 --> 03:32:06,210
Oh fuck, there is a global chat in Overwatch.

5987
03:32:06,410 --> 03:32:07,150
I forgot about that.

5988
03:32:07,150 --> 03:32:14,190
No, the LFG, not just the global chat, but the LFG section where people were like looking for players to play with.

5989
03:32:14,350 --> 03:32:18,410
And then they would do like LFGs for like the Mercy or the DPS players.

5990
03:32:18,450 --> 03:32:22,690
Like top 500 DPS player on Smurf account looking for Mercy pocket.

5991
03:32:24,450 --> 03:32:25,910
Oh my god.

5992
03:32:30,810 --> 03:32:35,270
Everybody blocked it from their heads because they don't want to remember.

5993
03:32:36,510 --> 03:32:41,090
But I will always remember the dark times of Overwatch.

5994
03:32:43,250 --> 03:32:47,190
Oh my god, I already forgot about most of it.

5995
03:32:47,250 --> 03:32:49,430
My PTSD is resurfacing.

5996
03:32:49,850 --> 03:32:51,570
And they would be like, do you have mic?

5997
03:32:52,770 --> 03:32:55,530
Oh shut the fuck up.

5998
03:32:58,770 --> 03:33:03,730
That's why when people are like, ew, Valorant is so cringe because of the e-dating scene.

5999
03:33:03,930 --> 03:33:06,730
And I was like, you guys don't remember real cringe.

6000
03:33:07,350 --> 03:33:10,010
Overwatch had it a lot worse.

6001
03:33:10,610 --> 03:33:11,330
Oh man.

6002
03:33:11,670 --> 03:33:14,890
Overwatch created the nightmare.

6003
03:33:15,530 --> 03:33:19,850
I feel like I just relived the life that I didn't have and turns out I had it and this is there.

6004
03:33:20,910 --> 03:33:22,110
Holy fuck.

6005
03:33:22,590 --> 03:33:23,570
Oh my god.

6006
03:33:26,150 --> 03:33:27,430
Oh my god.

6007
03:33:27,750 --> 03:33:29,270
I saw the cringe.

6008
03:33:29,270 --> 03:33:30,110
Enough YouTube for today.

6009
03:33:30,270 --> 03:33:34,890
I saw the cringe being made since day zero.

6010
03:33:35,070 --> 03:33:39,410
I was there at day zero when the cringe started.

6011
03:33:43,470 --> 03:33:45,690
Oh yeah, the Genji and Mercy.

6012
03:33:45,890 --> 03:33:49,030
Before then, it was the Genji and Mercy duels.

6013
03:33:49,390 --> 03:33:50,650
That's what made it worse.

6014
03:33:51,280 --> 03:33:52,530
I'm a Genji main.

6015
03:33:52,750 --> 03:33:53,030
Yeah.

6016
03:33:53,070 --> 03:33:54,250
That's what made it worse.

6017
03:33:55,890 --> 03:33:57,010
Fucking shit.

6018
03:33:57,470 --> 03:33:58,530
Hell no.

6019
03:33:59,750 --> 03:34:00,430
Hell no.

6020
03:34:00,430 --> 03:34:00,830
Hell bro.

6021
03:34:01,190 --> 03:34:03,710
Genji main looking for a Mercy duo.

6022
03:34:04,570 --> 03:34:07,590
But is Overwatch worth to play again though?

6023
03:34:07,750 --> 03:34:08,210
Yeah.

6024
03:34:08,410 --> 03:34:09,430
It's worth to play.

6025
03:34:09,450 --> 03:34:10,090
Don't take it seriously.

6026
03:34:10,590 --> 03:34:12,350
It's not as competitive anymore.

6027
03:34:12,910 --> 03:34:14,290
It's not as competitive anymore.

6028
03:34:14,370 --> 03:34:17,270
I would have to pay a few dollars to change my name.

6029
03:34:17,350 --> 03:34:17,790
That's...

6030
03:34:17,790 --> 03:34:21,690
Yeah, you do.

6031
03:34:21,910 --> 03:34:23,790
I'm still on that name.

6032
03:34:23,930 --> 03:34:24,330
Yeah.

6033
03:34:24,330 --> 03:34:25,370
I'm working on it.

6034
03:34:25,550 --> 03:34:26,230
Don't worry.

6035
03:34:26,670 --> 03:34:29,210
I had to change several accounts.

6036
03:34:30,950 --> 03:34:33,210
I had to change several account names.

6037
03:34:33,210 --> 03:34:34,530
I was like, I'm trying to change it.

6038
03:34:34,570 --> 03:34:36,090
And I was like, oh shit, I gotta pay this?

6039
03:34:36,090 --> 03:34:39,510
Yeah, you don't have your free one because you used it already.

6040
03:34:40,370 --> 03:34:42,650
I used it years ago, man.

6041
03:34:43,030 --> 03:34:45,230
I was there on day one as well.

6042
03:34:46,510 --> 03:34:46,990
Fuck.

6043
03:34:49,350 --> 03:34:50,050
It's okay.

6044
03:34:50,110 --> 03:34:51,150
I believe in you.

6045
03:34:52,930 --> 03:34:53,490
Right.

6046
03:34:53,630 --> 03:34:53,910
Honestly.

6047
03:34:53,910 --> 03:34:54,430
You just know...

6048
03:34:54,430 --> 03:34:54,710
Okay.

6049
03:34:55,510 --> 03:34:59,930
You can just put streamer mode on and then you never have to change it.

6050
03:35:00,250 --> 03:35:03,510
The streamer mode on changes your actual name.

6051
03:35:03,590 --> 03:35:05,070
The name of the account.

6052
03:35:05,310 --> 03:35:08,110
You just put streamer mode on and then you don't have...

6053
03:35:08,110 --> 03:35:10,430
Your name will always be like different every time.

6054
03:35:12,570 --> 03:35:13,670
Oh shit.

6055
03:35:15,290 --> 03:35:15,730
Yeah.

6056
03:35:15,730 --> 03:35:16,330
But yeah, I wish...

6057
03:35:16,330 --> 03:35:17,290
I hope there's...

6058
03:35:17,290 --> 03:35:19,490
I hope there's a new game soon.

6059
03:35:20,150 --> 03:35:20,710
Honestly.

6060
03:35:20,790 --> 03:35:21,130
I know.

6061
03:35:21,130 --> 03:35:21,650
I hope there's a new shooter.

6062
03:35:21,850 --> 03:35:27,890
But I think Valorant was the last... the last like big competitive FPS game.

6063
03:35:27,890 --> 03:35:32,430
And even now, I'll be honest, Valorant... the direction is kind of weird.

6064
03:35:32,590 --> 03:35:33,010
So...

6065
03:35:33,010 --> 03:35:34,690
And I mean, I don't play that.

6066
03:35:34,810 --> 03:35:40,110
I mean, it's mostly like I said, it's... it's from Riot and Riot is mostly like cosmetics.

6067
03:35:41,430 --> 03:35:41,910
And...

6068
03:35:43,050 --> 03:35:43,530
Yeah.

6069
03:35:43,530 --> 03:35:46,470
They put a heavy focus on cosmetic because that's where the money is.

6070
03:35:47,270 --> 03:35:48,370
And every time...

6071
03:35:48,370 --> 03:35:48,510
I see that.

6072
03:35:48,670 --> 03:35:48,930
Yeah.

6073
03:35:50,090 --> 03:35:54,910
Because like Riot loves having cosmetics and stuff, but like, I don't know.

6074
03:35:55,050 --> 03:35:55,730
It's just...

6075
03:35:55,730 --> 03:35:56,910
I feel like...

6076
03:35:59,450 --> 03:36:04,690
Other than that, I don't really know what other like shooter game has been out there.

6077
03:36:04,970 --> 03:36:06,110
It's been decent.

6078
03:36:07,970 --> 03:36:08,810
Shranova, guys.

6079
03:36:09,410 --> 03:36:10,010
Shranova...

6080
03:36:10,010 --> 03:36:11,170
It's...

6081
03:36:11,170 --> 03:36:12,910
It's interesting, but like...

6082
03:36:13,590 --> 03:36:15,270
It's also a tactical shooter.

6083
03:36:15,510 --> 03:36:15,990
So...

6084
03:36:17,690 --> 03:36:18,290
Yeah.

6085
03:36:18,350 --> 03:36:18,910
DB and...

6086
03:36:18,930 --> 03:36:19,530
Shranova...

6087
03:36:19,530 --> 03:36:19,890
Shranova...

6088
03:36:19,890 --> 03:36:20,890
Shranova...

6089
03:36:20,890 --> 03:36:23,350
The paper mechanic is really interesting.

6090
03:36:25,670 --> 03:36:26,710
But like...

6091
03:36:28,510 --> 03:36:29,030
It...

6092
03:36:29,750 --> 03:36:30,790
It like...

6093
03:36:30,790 --> 03:36:31,370
Okay.

6094
03:36:31,450 --> 03:36:33,410
I think Shranova is easier than Valorant.

6095
03:36:33,510 --> 03:36:34,070
A hundred percent.

6096
03:36:34,330 --> 03:36:35,870
Because I learned the abilities...

6097
03:36:35,870 --> 03:36:38,690
The ability usage faster than Valorant.

6098
03:36:38,930 --> 03:36:43,390
I still don't know how to use the abilities in Valorant, but like, I know how to use the abilities in Shranova.

6099
03:36:43,570 --> 03:36:45,430
But I think like Shranova...

6100
03:36:45,430 --> 03:36:46,730
I think the main...

6101
03:36:46,730 --> 03:36:48,910
Biggest issue of Shranova is like...

6102
03:36:48,910 --> 03:36:50,530
Is just that fact that like...

6103
03:36:50,530 --> 03:36:51,250
Um...

6104
03:36:51,860 --> 03:36:52,690
It's just...

6105
03:36:52,690 --> 03:36:55,650
The mechanics itself is like...

6106
03:36:55,650 --> 03:36:56,470
A little...

6107
03:36:56,470 --> 03:36:57,350
Weird.

6108
03:36:57,810 --> 03:37:00,610
It's like the paper mechanics is like...

6109
03:37:00,610 --> 03:37:02,510
Really weird to handle.

6110
03:37:02,890 --> 03:37:04,670
Because you can use the paper mechanics...

6111
03:37:04,670 --> 03:37:04,690
Right now...

6112
03:37:04,690 --> 03:37:05,990
I'm just on Gacha Games...

6113
03:37:05,990 --> 03:37:07,410
It's not a Gacha Game...

6114
03:37:07,410 --> 03:37:07,790
Because I'm so bored.

6115
03:37:07,790 --> 03:37:08,170
Because...

6116
03:37:08,170 --> 03:37:08,510
I know.

6117
03:37:08,570 --> 03:37:09,470
I'm just bored.

6118
03:37:09,630 --> 03:37:11,330
I'm on the Gacha Games right now.

6119
03:37:11,330 --> 03:37:12,030
Jesus Christ.

6120
03:37:12,250 --> 03:37:12,530
Yeah.

6121
03:37:12,650 --> 03:37:14,090
I think like Shranova.

6122
03:37:14,110 --> 03:37:16,550
The biggest issue with Shranova is that...

6123
03:37:16,550 --> 03:37:18,310
The hardcore gamers...

6124
03:37:18,310 --> 03:37:23,410
I think the FPS gamers will not play Stranova because it's anime.

6125
03:37:24,210 --> 03:37:24,850
Right.

6126
03:37:25,270 --> 03:37:32,810
Yeah, because I saw that Stranova is really popular amongst people who are into Genshin Impact and Gacha in general.

6127
03:37:33,030 --> 03:37:39,370
Because a lot of people that are playing Stranova were mostly just like, Who the fuck cut that tree?

6128
03:37:40,710 --> 03:37:41,350
What?

6129
03:37:41,590 --> 03:37:43,510
The tree fell on top of me.

6130
03:37:43,510 --> 03:37:52,590
But Stranova, people who played it were people who played Genshin Impact and stuff like that.

6131
03:37:52,770 --> 03:37:59,470
And they were like, oh I love Stranova because it's a game that is different from Genshin, but it's an FPS game.

6132
03:37:59,790 --> 03:38:01,310
Or not FPS, TPS.

6133
03:38:01,770 --> 03:38:08,830
But I saw in general, not a lot of the competitive scene.

6134
03:38:09,790 --> 03:38:10,350
The...

6135
03:38:11,970 --> 03:38:13,150
Yeah, the osu!

6136
03:38:13,210 --> 03:38:13,450
play.

6137
03:38:13,510 --> 03:38:13,750
The osu!

6138
03:38:13,750 --> 03:38:14,470
players and the Genshin...

6139
03:38:14,470 --> 03:38:17,610
The Gacha players love Stranova.

6140
03:38:17,830 --> 03:38:25,570
But if you talk about the competitive shooter fanbase, I barely saw anybody was hyping it up.

6141
03:38:25,750 --> 03:38:27,170
So I think that was the biggest issue.

6142
03:38:27,410 --> 03:38:34,570
Because the fanbase for shooter games, especially in the West, if they see anime, they're just like, ugh.

6143
03:38:35,770 --> 03:38:37,010
Yeah, no shit.

6144
03:38:37,270 --> 03:38:39,350
Because there's a lot of normies there.

6145
03:38:39,650 --> 03:38:40,350
I'm in the same period.

6146
03:38:40,990 --> 03:38:42,630
Normies are like, ugh, anime.

6147
03:38:44,450 --> 03:38:51,410
They'll be like, ugh, Call of Duty, Apex, Battle Run, Call of Duty, Battlefield.

6148
03:38:52,430 --> 03:38:57,890
But when they see anime, even if it's a good shooter, they'll just be like, ugh, anime.

6149
03:39:01,890 --> 03:39:02,690
It's true!

6150
03:39:02,950 --> 03:39:06,650
When I got invited to the tournament, I literally had like...

6151
03:39:07,850 --> 03:39:11,130
I did not see Shroud play Stranova.

6152
03:39:11,130 --> 03:39:16,430
I did not see Timmy or Shroud play Stranova.

6153
03:39:17,050 --> 03:39:21,190
And Shroud would play every FPS...

6154
03:39:21,190 --> 03:39:23,190
Shroud would play any shooter game.

6155
03:39:23,370 --> 03:39:25,390
But I didn't see Shroud play Stranova.

6156
03:39:25,650 --> 03:39:27,390
So I thought that was like...

6157
03:39:28,090 --> 03:39:33,870
That basically sort of tells you what the normal playerbase would want to watch.

6158
03:39:35,890 --> 03:39:37,050
Oh yeah, Deadlock.

6159
03:39:37,210 --> 03:39:39,470
Fucking Valve's upcoming game.

6160
03:39:39,570 --> 03:39:40,310
Something like that.

6161
03:39:41,130 --> 03:39:42,590
Oh yeah, yeah, Deadlock, yeah.

6162
03:39:43,950 --> 03:39:45,150
Hopefully that's okay.

6163
03:39:45,550 --> 03:39:46,090
Deadlock?

6164
03:39:46,830 --> 03:39:49,230
Is Deadlock the newest Valve game, right?

6165
03:39:51,050 --> 03:39:52,130
Valve upcoming.

6166
03:39:52,470 --> 03:39:53,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6167
03:39:53,810 --> 03:39:54,350
It's...

6168
03:39:55,000 --> 03:39:58,130
Wait, I don't remember what I'm allowed or not allowed to say.

6169
03:39:59,250 --> 03:39:59,790
What?

6170
03:40:00,970 --> 03:40:01,510
Insane.

6171
03:40:02,670 --> 03:40:03,410
That's insane.

6172
03:40:06,850 --> 03:40:07,530
That's insane.

6173
03:40:08,110 --> 03:40:10,830
I think you just said something...

6174
03:40:11,130 --> 03:40:12,430
You shouldn't say, but okay.

6175
03:40:14,330 --> 03:40:16,350
I guess that's all I'll say.

6176
03:40:16,830 --> 03:40:18,810
There you go, chat.

6177
03:40:22,250 --> 03:40:23,550
No way.

6178
03:40:24,230 --> 03:40:24,950
No way.

6179
03:40:24,950 --> 03:40:25,370
No way.

6180
03:40:25,590 --> 03:40:26,170
No way.

6181
03:40:26,170 --> 03:40:26,250
No way.

6182
03:40:26,590 --> 03:40:26,830
No way.

6183
03:40:27,110 --> 03:40:27,830
No way.

6184
03:40:28,110 --> 03:40:28,830
No way.

6185
03:40:28,830 --> 03:40:28,850
No way.

6186
03:40:29,710 --> 03:40:30,430
No way.

6187
03:40:35,510 --> 03:40:36,950
No way.

6188
03:40:36,950 --> 03:40:37,410
Oh my god.

6189
03:40:38,310 --> 03:40:39,430
I didn't say anything.

6190
03:40:39,550 --> 03:40:40,750
I just said, Deadlock is.

6191
03:40:40,970 --> 03:40:41,850
That's all I said.

6192
03:40:42,310 --> 03:40:42,790
Right.

6193
03:40:44,150 --> 03:40:44,630
Right.

6194
03:40:45,450 --> 03:40:46,670
Right, right, right, right.

6195
03:40:46,790 --> 03:40:47,170
Interesting.

6196
03:40:48,730 --> 03:40:49,510
Totally, totally.

6197
03:40:49,750 --> 03:40:50,630
I can back that up.

6198
03:40:50,930 --> 03:40:51,210
Yeah.

6199
03:40:52,030 --> 03:40:54,230
She just said that and that's it.

6200
03:40:54,810 --> 03:40:56,470
She didn't say anything of it.

6201
03:40:57,670 --> 03:40:58,150
Interesting.

6202
03:40:58,510 --> 03:40:58,930
Yeah.

6203
03:40:59,130 --> 03:40:59,610
Interesting.

6204
03:41:01,930 --> 03:41:03,550
We heard nothing, guys.

6205
03:41:04,050 --> 03:41:04,850
That's funny.

6206
03:41:05,170 --> 03:41:06,210
Whose house is this?

6207
03:41:06,290 --> 03:41:06,590
What the heck?

6208
03:41:06,610 --> 03:41:06,930
Whose house?

6209
03:41:06,930 --> 03:41:09,610
Yeah, who the fuck built their house above us?

6210
03:41:12,350 --> 03:41:14,350
Where did this guy come from?

6211
03:41:14,470 --> 03:41:14,690
Oh, wait.

6212
03:41:14,750 --> 03:41:15,850
It's this guy's house.

6213
03:41:16,050 --> 03:41:16,550
Hey.

6214
03:41:17,410 --> 03:41:18,590
Without their permission.

6215
03:41:19,710 --> 03:41:20,390
Oh my god.

6216
03:41:20,390 --> 03:41:21,210
He doesn't have pants either.

6217
03:41:21,370 --> 03:41:21,530
Wait.

6218
03:41:21,610 --> 03:41:22,770
He's literally in his underwear.

6219
03:41:25,050 --> 03:41:26,030
Just like us.

6220
03:41:26,330 --> 03:41:26,750
Wait.

6221
03:41:26,790 --> 03:41:26,910
No.

6222
03:41:26,910 --> 03:41:28,070
Take off your pants right now.

6223
03:41:28,930 --> 03:41:29,430
What?

6224
03:41:31,250 --> 03:41:31,750
Damn.

6225
03:41:32,310 --> 03:41:35,510
Everybody else has no pants except you and number six.

6226
03:41:35,510 --> 03:41:36,230
Because the number six is...

6227
03:41:36,230 --> 03:41:36,910
Because the number six is...

6228
03:41:36,910 --> 03:41:42,250
Goddamn shit that has told me to not wear any fucking... to wear... what do you call it?

6229
03:41:42,990 --> 03:41:44,630
You gotta join the crowd.

6230
03:41:45,230 --> 03:41:45,390
Holy shit.

6231
03:41:45,490 --> 03:41:46,350
I can be naked naked.

6232
03:41:46,490 --> 03:41:46,630
Look.

6233
03:41:46,690 --> 03:41:47,010
Wait.

6234
03:41:47,090 --> 03:41:47,690
What the fuck?

6235
03:41:47,710 --> 03:41:48,750
Can I be naked naked?

6236
03:41:49,490 --> 03:41:50,630
What the fuck?

6237
03:41:50,710 --> 03:41:50,910
Wait.

6238
03:41:50,910 --> 03:41:51,710
What the fuck?

6239
03:41:51,750 --> 03:41:52,490
You can do that?

6240
03:41:53,330 --> 03:41:55,470
There's like pants underneath the pants?

6241
03:41:56,530 --> 03:41:57,010
Yeah.

6242
03:41:57,690 --> 03:41:58,570
Oh my god.

6243
03:41:58,570 --> 03:41:58,790
Wait.

6244
03:41:58,830 --> 03:41:59,130
You're right.

6245
03:41:59,530 --> 03:42:00,010
Wait.

6246
03:42:00,170 --> 03:42:01,270
How do I unequip it?

6247
03:42:02,050 --> 03:42:02,990
Oh my god.

6248
03:42:04,850 --> 03:42:05,810
Holy shit.

6249
03:42:05,850 --> 03:42:06,230
Look at that.

6250
03:42:06,230 --> 03:42:06,790
Oh my god.

6251
03:42:06,910 --> 03:42:07,110
Look at that.

6252
03:42:07,110 --> 03:42:07,150
Holy shit.

6253
03:42:09,870 --> 03:42:11,410
Oh my god!

6254
03:42:11,670 --> 03:42:12,330
Yeah!

6255
03:42:12,550 --> 03:42:13,610
It's possible!?

6256
03:42:13,610 --> 03:42:14,510
Okay...

6257
03:42:14,510 --> 03:42:16,050
Now put pants back on him.

6258
03:42:16,050 --> 03:42:17,730
Holy shit.

6259
03:42:17,850 --> 03:42:18,430
Oh my god.

6260
03:42:18,430 --> 03:42:18,590
What the fuck?

6261
03:42:19,090 --> 03:42:22,450
You can go beyond.

6262
03:42:23,170 --> 03:42:24,550
What the fuck?

6263
03:42:32,150 --> 03:42:33,470
You're chilling.

6264
03:42:34,170 --> 03:42:35,210
Oh, why?

6265
03:42:36,150 --> 03:42:36,890
You can go beyond.

6266
03:42:38,770 --> 03:42:39,910
Oh my god.

6267
03:42:44,330 --> 03:42:47,910
Yeah, I do hope Trinova does do well in the future.

6268
03:42:48,390 --> 03:42:53,170
And like the normie shooter people would enjoy it because it is interesting.

6269
03:42:53,470 --> 03:43:06,230
I feel like if the normies tried Trinova and are not like, ugh anime and stuff like that, I think it could go really well because the game and mechanics are pretty interesting.

6270
03:43:06,910 --> 03:43:11,390
And like I hope they have the Overwatch mode as a ranking too.

6271
03:43:11,650 --> 03:43:13,310
Because the ranked game is Valorant.

6272
03:43:14,110 --> 03:43:17,150
Quick Play is Overwatch, which I thought was pretty silly.

6273
03:43:17,410 --> 03:43:17,870
Like...

6274
03:43:19,030 --> 03:43:25,410
I feel like both the Overwatch section and the Valorant section should be its own thing.

6275
03:43:26,390 --> 03:43:28,990
They shouldn't make one as Quick Play and the other as Rank.

6276
03:43:32,550 --> 03:43:39,270
Oh yeah, and then apparently the Overwatch mode was super imbalanced too because like it's like defense-sided.

6277
03:43:40,030 --> 03:43:44,090
Which I agree when I played it, it was 100% defense-sided.

6278
03:43:45,730 --> 03:43:50,210
Because it's so hard to like play attack on the maps.

6279
03:43:52,730 --> 03:43:54,590
Yeah, I saw a little bit of game plan.

6280
03:43:54,810 --> 03:43:55,250
Yeah.

6281
03:43:55,330 --> 03:43:56,690
Oh, Marvel Rivals.

6282
03:43:56,710 --> 03:43:58,750
I hope Marvel Rivals does well, honestly.

6283
03:43:59,430 --> 03:44:01,230
Yeah, yeah, I got you in Marvel Rivals.

6284
03:44:01,450 --> 03:44:01,770
Yeah.

6285
03:44:01,890 --> 03:44:02,330
Yeah.

6286
03:44:02,350 --> 03:44:06,310
Yeah, you got me in and I didn't play that much since the server is only available.

6287
03:44:06,430 --> 03:44:07,070
Yeah.

6288
03:44:07,370 --> 03:44:09,390
Because it was pretty unstable for me.

6289
03:44:09,470 --> 03:44:10,170
Holy shit.

6290
03:44:10,350 --> 03:44:12,710
But I enjoyed it so far, especially in the training.

6291
03:44:12,910 --> 03:44:13,330
Yeah.

6292
03:44:13,330 --> 03:44:13,890
Holy fuck.

6293
03:44:14,090 --> 03:44:14,530
Yeah, but then it's gonna...

6294
03:44:14,530 --> 03:44:15,550
The complexity of the heroes...

6295
03:44:15,550 --> 03:44:16,410
Oh, I...

6296
03:44:16,410 --> 03:44:17,710
Do you hear it?

6297
03:44:17,770 --> 03:44:20,410
The next beta test is next week, right?

6298
03:44:20,450 --> 03:44:21,010
The Asia server, yeah.

6299
03:44:21,310 --> 03:44:23,310
Next week or in two weeks, I think.

6300
03:44:23,630 --> 03:44:24,070
Yeah.

6301
03:44:24,090 --> 03:44:24,770
The next beta test.

6302
03:44:25,330 --> 03:44:28,250
I'm definitely gonna try it again for the next test.

6303
03:44:30,150 --> 03:44:35,070
I definitely had a lot of fun with Marvel Rivals, but the official game comes out in 2025.

6304
03:44:36,430 --> 03:44:37,630
That's still a long way.

6305
03:44:37,730 --> 03:44:38,950
Yeah, so like...

6306
03:44:38,950 --> 03:44:42,690
We gotta wait until 2025 to play the game.

6307
03:44:45,350 --> 03:44:45,910
Yeah.

6308
03:44:46,110 --> 03:44:48,770
Welcome to our like impromptu podcast, guys.

6309
03:44:48,850 --> 03:44:49,030
Sorry.

6310
03:44:49,350 --> 03:44:49,910
Yeah.

6311
03:44:50,210 --> 03:44:52,190
Like for... Nah, for me it's normal.

6312
03:44:52,410 --> 03:44:55,070
Because every game is just basically free talk for me.

6313
03:44:55,090 --> 03:44:55,310
Yeah.

6314
03:44:56,090 --> 03:44:56,650
Legit.

6315
03:44:56,730 --> 03:44:57,590
From here.

6316
03:44:57,710 --> 03:44:58,870
Out of the gate is...

6317
03:44:58,870 --> 03:44:59,630
Get away.

6318
03:45:00,790 --> 03:45:02,850
Yeah, I hope... I hope... I hope...

6319
03:45:02,850 --> 03:45:03,810
Uh...

6320
03:45:03,810 --> 03:45:06,410
Marvel Rivals is also successful because...

6321
03:45:06,410 --> 03:45:08,710
Like we need a new game for the shooters.

6322
03:45:10,430 --> 03:45:11,450
We're just so...

6323
03:45:11,450 --> 03:45:12,470
It's just been like...

6324
03:45:12,470 --> 03:45:14,610
We're all bouncing between...

6325
03:45:14,610 --> 03:45:19,050
Like we're all like bouncing to game to game to game trying to find a new game to play.

6326
03:45:19,750 --> 03:45:23,890
Like for me right now, if it's just stupid FPS, it's just again Tarkov.

6327
03:45:24,030 --> 03:45:24,810
The fuck is this?

6328
03:45:24,970 --> 03:45:27,650
It's just Tarkov, Apex or Overwatch.

6329
03:45:28,510 --> 03:45:29,490
And then for...

6330
03:45:29,490 --> 03:45:32,270
And then if you're like a tactical shooter, Valorant.

6331
03:45:33,310 --> 03:45:34,630
Look, I'm just like...

6332
03:45:34,630 --> 03:45:35,910
I don't care.

6333
03:45:36,030 --> 03:45:41,910
Whatever it takes for someone to get back to their lobbies or me to my back at my lobbies.

6334
03:45:42,030 --> 03:45:42,290
Yeah.

6335
03:45:42,450 --> 03:45:44,350
I'm sorry for those who are like...

6336
03:45:44,350 --> 03:45:44,590
As soon as possible without listening to shit.

6337
03:45:44,870 --> 03:45:45,930
What about CSGO?

6338
03:45:46,530 --> 03:45:47,750
Guys, you know...

6339
03:45:47,750 --> 03:45:48,750
Or CSGO 2.

6340
03:45:48,930 --> 03:45:49,210
I play...

6341
03:45:49,210 --> 03:45:51,030
Guys, you know CS is...

6342
03:45:51,030 --> 03:45:51,170
I play CS 2.

6343
03:45:51,310 --> 03:45:52,730
CS 2 is...

6344
03:45:52,730 --> 03:45:53,170
But...

6345
03:45:53,170 --> 03:45:55,150
Is only alive in Europe.

6346
03:45:55,390 --> 03:45:56,530
You guys don't lie.

6347
03:45:57,030 --> 03:45:57,570
It's...

6348
03:45:57,570 --> 03:46:00,530
It's alive in EU and Asia.

6349
03:46:00,650 --> 03:46:01,290
Yeah, it's...

6350
03:46:02,090 --> 03:46:02,630
But...

6351
03:46:02,630 --> 03:46:02,930
Yeah.

6352
03:46:03,050 --> 03:46:04,170
But I don't know about NA.

6353
03:46:04,250 --> 03:46:04,610
But...

6354
03:46:04,610 --> 03:46:05,050
And it...

6355
03:46:05,050 --> 03:46:06,270
No, it's dead.

6356
03:46:06,450 --> 03:46:08,650
It's like almost dead in NA.

6357
03:46:09,730 --> 03:46:16,250
Because the only thing I do in CS 2 now is just to sell and buy items.

6358
03:46:17,930 --> 03:46:19,450
Like how I used to.

6359
03:46:21,150 --> 03:46:24,230
And yeah, I'm up like $300 in CS already.

6360
03:46:24,470 --> 03:46:24,690
Yeah.

6361
03:46:24,730 --> 03:46:26,350
I haven't cashed it out.

6362
03:46:26,350 --> 03:46:27,690
Don't people like use like...

6363
03:46:27,690 --> 03:46:32,470
Like CSGO and CS 2 like skins and knives to like...

6364
03:46:32,470 --> 03:46:33,690
What's the word?

6365
03:46:33,870 --> 03:46:34,430
Like...

6366
03:46:36,050 --> 03:46:37,090
What's the word when they...

6367
03:46:37,090 --> 03:46:39,670
When they like use it for like money...

6368
03:46:39,670 --> 03:46:39,950
Trade?

6369
03:46:39,950 --> 03:46:40,750
Trade money legally?

6370
03:46:41,750 --> 03:46:42,150
RMT?

6371
03:46:42,770 --> 03:46:43,910
No, no, no, no, no, no.

6372
03:46:44,550 --> 03:46:45,510
There's like a word for it.

6373
03:46:45,550 --> 03:46:46,690
For those who trade money laundering.

6374
03:46:46,790 --> 03:46:47,010
Yeah.

6375
03:46:47,090 --> 03:46:48,110
A lot of people use...

6376
03:46:48,110 --> 03:46:48,590
Money laundering?

6377
03:46:48,730 --> 03:46:49,490
You guys do know that?

6378
03:46:49,590 --> 03:46:53,550
A lot of people use like CSGO and CS 2 skins for like money laundering.

6379
03:46:54,110 --> 03:46:57,730
That's why like sometimes knives go for like in crazy prices.

6380
03:46:58,150 --> 03:46:59,770
Because they use it for money laundering.

6381
03:47:01,930 --> 03:47:02,610
You know that?

6382
03:47:02,910 --> 03:47:03,250
I mean...

6383
03:47:03,710 --> 03:47:04,350
I mean...

6384
03:47:04,350 --> 03:47:04,590
I mean...

6385
03:47:04,590 --> 03:47:05,030
I heard.

6386
03:47:05,090 --> 03:47:05,770
So I heard.

6387
03:47:05,850 --> 03:47:06,290
But like...

6388
03:47:06,290 --> 03:47:06,850
Man.

6389
03:47:09,710 --> 03:47:13,330
The most expensive thing I had is just like $210 and that's it.

6390
03:47:13,550 --> 03:47:13,910
Yeah.

6391
03:47:13,910 --> 03:47:14,090
Yeah.

6392
03:47:14,130 --> 03:47:14,750
That's what I...

6393
03:47:14,750 --> 03:47:16,290
Like I know like they do that as well.

6394
03:47:16,350 --> 03:47:16,770
Because like...

6395
03:47:17,330 --> 03:47:19,570
They used to do that for like art galleries.

6396
03:47:19,850 --> 03:47:20,730
So like in art galleries...

6397
03:47:22,170 --> 03:47:26,810
Some art pieces go for like millions of dollars, but it's usually a money laundering scheme.

6398
03:47:28,570 --> 03:47:33,090
Like you see like very expensive paintings being sold at art galleries, but it's not really...

6399
03:47:33,090 --> 03:47:34,430
They're not really selling the painting.

6400
03:47:34,670 --> 03:47:36,270
They're just using it for like money laundering.

6401
03:47:36,530 --> 03:47:39,470
So they do that, but with like CSGO skins too.

6402
03:47:41,870 --> 03:47:42,830
Or they still do.

6403
03:47:42,950 --> 03:47:45,510
They still do, but it's like another way to do money laundering.

6404
03:47:45,690 --> 03:47:46,490
But like...

6405
03:47:46,490 --> 03:47:47,590
You know, they won't...

6406
03:47:50,370 --> 03:47:52,690
People are like, we can't confirm or deny that.

6407
03:47:55,170 --> 03:47:56,670
Or like tax evasion.

6408
03:47:56,790 --> 03:47:57,650
Yeah, I guess too.

6409
03:47:57,890 --> 03:47:59,050
I love tax evasion.

6410
03:47:59,430 --> 03:47:59,810
Huh?

6411
03:48:00,070 --> 03:48:00,510
Huh?

6412
03:48:00,890 --> 03:48:03,070
Oh, and you said I said something that could be...

6413
03:48:03,090 --> 03:48:06,510
Potentially illegal, but you just said I love tax evasion.

6414
03:48:07,030 --> 03:48:07,510
Huh?

6415
03:48:08,290 --> 03:48:08,770
Huh?

6416
03:48:10,610 --> 03:48:11,930
No, no, no, no.

6417
03:48:11,990 --> 03:48:12,830
I pay my taxes.

6418
03:48:13,230 --> 03:48:13,870
Do you?

6419
03:48:14,130 --> 03:48:14,870
I buy cigarettes.

6420
03:48:18,190 --> 03:48:19,770
That's a huge amount of tax.

6421
03:48:20,030 --> 03:48:20,610
It's crazy.

6422
03:48:21,510 --> 03:48:22,230
No, but...

6423
03:48:22,230 --> 03:48:24,730
But actually, oh yeah, I actually quit smoking.

6424
03:48:24,990 --> 03:48:25,530
I'm trying...

6425
03:48:25,530 --> 03:48:26,090
Wait, you quit...

6426
03:48:26,090 --> 03:48:27,330
Oh, you're trying to, right?

6427
03:48:27,910 --> 03:48:28,850
It's like my...

6428
03:48:28,850 --> 03:48:30,170
It's like my second week.

6429
03:48:30,330 --> 03:48:30,850
And I'm...

6430
03:48:30,850 --> 03:48:31,790
Your second week?

6431
03:48:32,450 --> 03:48:32,990
Mm-hmm.

6432
03:48:32,990 --> 03:48:33,070
I'm trying to...

6433
03:48:33,070 --> 03:48:34,430
Holy shit, are you okay?

6434
03:48:35,150 --> 03:48:35,590
No.

6435
03:48:35,810 --> 03:48:36,390
Oh, okay.

6436
03:48:36,890 --> 03:48:37,330
Okay.

6437
03:48:38,210 --> 03:48:39,730
Yeah, how long have you been smoking?

6438
03:48:40,830 --> 03:48:42,290
How long have I been smoking?

6439
03:48:42,410 --> 03:48:42,570
Yeah.

6440
03:48:43,590 --> 03:48:44,690
Like the whole...

6441
03:48:45,670 --> 03:48:46,530
12 years.

6442
03:48:47,530 --> 03:48:48,410
12 years.

6443
03:48:48,630 --> 03:48:49,850
Oh my God, good luck, man.

6444
03:48:50,110 --> 03:48:50,490
Yeah.

6445
03:48:50,550 --> 03:48:51,170
I believe in you.

6446
03:48:51,310 --> 03:48:51,330
Yeah.

6447
03:48:51,830 --> 03:48:58,370
Especially like for like an Asian guy, like it's so hard to quit smoking.

6448
03:48:58,870 --> 03:48:59,310
Yep.

6449
03:48:59,430 --> 03:49:01,490
Yeah, because like it's like sort of like...

6450
03:49:01,490 --> 03:49:02,490
What's it called?

6451
03:49:02,530 --> 03:49:02,990
Like a culture.

6452
03:49:02,990 --> 03:49:03,050
Yeah.

6453
03:49:03,070 --> 03:49:04,490
Like a culture sort of type deal.

6454
03:49:04,990 --> 03:49:05,470
Yeah.

6455
03:49:05,670 --> 03:49:08,590
The reason why I'm quitting is not because of health reasons.

6456
03:49:09,130 --> 03:49:10,470
Because it's getting expensive.

6457
03:49:10,990 --> 03:49:11,010
Financial.

6458
03:49:11,010 --> 03:49:11,610
And the taste...

6459
03:49:11,610 --> 03:49:13,330
Not just that.

6460
03:49:13,510 --> 03:49:14,510
Not just that.

6461
03:49:14,790 --> 03:49:15,710
Not just that.

6462
03:49:15,850 --> 03:49:22,690
But the number one for me, like I honestly, if the taste is all right, I'll probably still going.

6463
03:49:22,910 --> 03:49:25,390
But the taste is shit and they charge more.

6464
03:49:25,510 --> 03:49:27,330
So I'm like, what is this shit?

6465
03:49:27,990 --> 03:49:30,150
You don't taste like you used to.

6466
03:49:30,230 --> 03:49:30,830
Fuck you.

6467
03:49:30,850 --> 03:49:31,450
I'm buying this.

6468
03:49:31,450 --> 03:49:31,890
I'm mad.

6469
03:49:32,670 --> 03:49:34,330
I even called their customer support.

6470
03:49:34,450 --> 03:49:34,490
So it's like a boycott.

6471
03:49:34,490 --> 03:49:35,930
It's like a boycott for you.

6472
03:49:39,830 --> 03:49:40,850
What the hell, man?

6473
03:49:41,170 --> 03:49:41,950
Good luck, man.

6474
03:49:42,010 --> 03:49:43,310
I think you can do it.

6475
03:49:43,350 --> 03:49:44,750
If you like dedicate...

6476
03:49:44,750 --> 03:49:47,830
And you should also like look at how much you save just to motivate yourself too.

6477
03:49:48,270 --> 03:49:51,550
Is it bad that I go to coffee instead now?

6478
03:49:51,630 --> 03:49:52,410
Because like...

6479
03:49:52,410 --> 03:49:59,250
Well, like drinking excessive amount of coffee is not healthy, but...

6480
03:49:59,250 --> 03:50:00,030
Well, no shit.

6481
03:50:00,170 --> 03:50:01,010
No shit.

6482
03:50:01,990 --> 03:50:04,250
But it's healthier than smoking.

6483
03:50:05,030 --> 03:50:06,630
It doesn't fuck up your lungs.

6484
03:50:06,790 --> 03:50:09,110
It just fucks up your heart.

6485
03:50:10,990 --> 03:50:11,950
Well, shit.

6486
03:50:12,090 --> 03:50:14,190
Yeah, well, I don't drink that much of a coffee.

6487
03:50:14,790 --> 03:50:18,570
I mean, I'm starting to learn how to brew itself and grinding it and shit.

6488
03:50:18,590 --> 03:50:18,850
Oh, shit.

6489
03:50:19,010 --> 03:50:19,410
Yeah.

6490
03:50:19,830 --> 03:50:21,210
That's pretty good.

6491
03:50:21,410 --> 03:50:21,630
Yeah.

6492
03:50:22,470 --> 03:50:23,530
What the fuck?

6493
03:50:23,550 --> 03:50:24,150
What is that cover?

6494
03:50:24,290 --> 03:50:25,590
It's another crocodile.

6495
03:50:26,170 --> 03:50:27,110
Jesus Christ.

6496
03:50:27,290 --> 03:50:28,230
What the fuck?

6497
03:50:29,130 --> 03:50:30,790
This game is freaky.

6498
03:50:30,950 --> 03:50:31,430
What the fuck?

6499
03:50:31,430 --> 03:50:34,550
It's just the crocodile out of nowhere.

6500
03:50:35,270 --> 03:50:39,810
Yeah, like as long as like, you know, it's like healthier than smoking.

6501
03:50:40,350 --> 03:50:48,230
And I think like if you track down like how much money you spent, like there are saved each week from it, I think it'll motivate you even more.

6502
03:50:48,930 --> 03:50:49,410
Yeah.

6503
03:50:49,890 --> 03:50:50,370
Yeah.

6504
03:50:50,470 --> 03:50:54,690
Because for me right now, I don't even buy like those nicotine patches or anything.

6505
03:50:54,910 --> 03:50:55,130
So...

6506
03:50:55,130 --> 03:50:55,570
Yeah.

6507
03:50:55,650 --> 03:50:56,670
I'm just straight drawing it.

6508
03:50:56,670 --> 03:50:57,050
Yeah.

6509
03:50:57,190 --> 03:50:58,610
Holy cold turkey.

6510
03:50:58,610 --> 03:50:59,810
You're just...

6511
03:50:59,830 --> 03:51:00,490
Cold turkey.

6512
03:51:00,530 --> 03:51:04,210
And then I'm thinking, what if I buy like, what do you call it?

6513
03:51:04,250 --> 03:51:08,370
A vape, but like the juice is not like without the nicotine, you know?

6514
03:51:08,370 --> 03:51:08,750
Yeah.

6515
03:51:08,830 --> 03:51:11,050
But vaping is also like similar though.

6516
03:51:11,630 --> 03:51:13,530
It's just going from one addiction to another.

6517
03:51:13,530 --> 03:51:14,010
It's just the nicotine.

6518
03:51:14,170 --> 03:51:17,290
The thing is the nicotine is fucking me up and I don't...

6519
03:51:17,290 --> 03:51:18,710
But isn't vaping more expensive?

6520
03:51:18,830 --> 03:51:20,170
Because you're buying like refills.

6521
03:51:20,810 --> 03:51:21,090
Yeah.

6522
03:51:21,090 --> 03:51:22,130
Honestly, it's cheaper.

6523
03:51:22,410 --> 03:51:22,570
Yeah.

6524
03:51:22,570 --> 03:51:23,210
Oh, it's cheaper?

6525
03:51:23,450 --> 03:51:23,750
Okay.

6526
03:51:23,810 --> 03:51:24,730
I was just thinking like...

6527
03:51:24,730 --> 03:51:28,150
I know like vaping can become more expensive.

6528
03:51:28,150 --> 03:51:28,590
Yeah.

6529
03:51:28,610 --> 03:51:30,490
Especially there's no nicotine.

6530
03:51:30,830 --> 03:51:31,350
Like...

6531
03:51:31,350 --> 03:51:31,550
Yeah.

6532
03:51:31,610 --> 03:51:32,410
So it's not taxed.

6533
03:51:33,190 --> 03:51:33,710
Yeah.

6534
03:51:33,750 --> 03:51:35,030
But vaping is also bad too.

6535
03:51:35,950 --> 03:51:37,030
Everything is bad in life.

6536
03:51:37,030 --> 03:51:37,370
Yeah.

6537
03:51:37,470 --> 03:51:38,870
But caffeine is better than vaping.

6538
03:51:39,630 --> 03:51:40,150
Right.

6539
03:51:40,290 --> 03:51:40,930
That's true.

6540
03:51:41,070 --> 03:51:41,250
Yeah.

6541
03:51:41,250 --> 03:51:43,810
You might as well do like caffeine instead of vaping because it's like...

6542
03:51:43,810 --> 03:51:45,390
It's like healthier.

6543
03:51:45,730 --> 03:51:47,630
Well, I mean like quote unquote healthier.

6544
03:51:47,970 --> 03:51:50,090
It's the healthier addiction.

6545
03:51:50,590 --> 03:51:51,930
Like to like...

6546
03:51:51,930 --> 03:51:52,810
It's the lesser evil.

6547
03:51:52,810 --> 03:51:53,210
Yeah.

6548
03:51:53,270 --> 03:51:54,550
The lesser of all evil.

6549
03:51:54,570 --> 03:51:56,610
The lesser of three evils.

6550
03:51:56,850 --> 03:51:57,370
Like...

6551
03:51:58,070 --> 03:51:58,590
I don't know.

6552
03:51:59,170 --> 03:51:59,950
It's pretty...

6553
03:51:59,950 --> 03:52:00,010
It's pretty...

6554
03:52:00,010 --> 03:52:00,490
All in moderation.

6555
03:52:00,570 --> 03:52:00,910
Yeah.

6556
03:52:00,910 --> 03:52:01,070
Yeah.

6557
03:52:01,210 --> 03:52:01,550
It's how we know.

6558
03:52:01,610 --> 03:52:02,490
Like caffeine is bad.

6559
03:52:02,490 --> 03:52:03,570
Number six is so real.

6560
03:52:03,570 --> 03:52:04,530
But like if...

6561
03:52:05,030 --> 03:52:10,210
If like he has to pick between caffeine, cigarettes or vaping.

6562
03:52:11,130 --> 03:52:13,170
I'd rather just cut caffeine I guess.

6563
03:52:13,250 --> 03:52:13,610
Yeah.

6564
03:52:13,610 --> 03:52:14,130
Like we have...

6565
03:52:14,130 --> 03:52:16,650
Like because like I don't think Tenjin can like...

6566
03:52:16,650 --> 03:52:25,470
He could try but I feel like it's better to just like swap to like a lesser harmful addiction than going like full on cold turkey because that's also not good for you.

6567
03:52:25,590 --> 03:52:27,230
To just completely stop.

6568
03:52:27,410 --> 03:52:27,670
Yeah.

6569
03:52:27,670 --> 03:52:28,290
Like for the...

6570
03:52:28,290 --> 03:52:29,790
For the four...

6571
03:52:29,790 --> 03:52:33,510
First four days when I sleep, my leg just...

6572
03:52:33,510 --> 03:52:33,990
Yeah.

6573
03:52:34,170 --> 03:52:40,170
Trembles so fucking much and I woke up with a sore leg because of like the excessive shakiness like holy shit.

6574
03:52:40,170 --> 03:52:40,210
Yeah.

6575
03:52:40,210 --> 03:52:40,410
Yeah.

6576
03:52:40,530 --> 03:52:45,490
Like going cold turkey like quitting suddenly all of a sudden is really, really bad too.

6577
03:52:45,670 --> 03:52:46,070
Oh yeah.

6578
03:52:46,070 --> 03:52:50,170
So it's better to like do it like in moderation and like less...

6579
03:52:50,170 --> 03:52:50,410
Yeah.

6580
03:52:50,450 --> 03:52:52,890
And like less stressful than just like stopping altogether.

6581
03:52:54,610 --> 03:52:55,550
And then like...

6582
03:52:55,550 --> 03:52:55,810
Yeah.

6583
03:52:55,810 --> 03:52:57,670
And then if caffeine gets pretty bad, you're...

6584
03:52:57,670 --> 03:53:00,470
Then like he can slowly try and stop that.

6585
03:53:00,810 --> 03:53:02,850
And then you can swap to tea after coffee.

6586
03:53:04,770 --> 03:53:06,230
I do tea sometimes.

6587
03:53:06,430 --> 03:53:07,090
Tea or coffee.

6588
03:53:07,230 --> 03:53:07,390
Yeah.

6589
03:53:07,450 --> 03:53:07,810
That's good.

6590
03:53:07,890 --> 03:53:08,950
Tea is also pretty healthy.

6591
03:53:08,950 --> 03:53:09,590
I'm more of a...

6592
03:53:09,590 --> 03:53:11,670
I'm more of a both of worlds.

6593
03:53:11,830 --> 03:53:17,150
It's just that I need the more of a little bit more of a kick because...

6594
03:53:17,150 --> 03:53:17,590
Yeah.

6595
03:53:17,590 --> 03:53:20,850
Either way for me, tea or coffee, I will shit in either way.

6596
03:53:21,470 --> 03:53:22,930
I think that's for everybody.

6597
03:53:23,010 --> 03:53:24,390
That's what caffeine does.

6598
03:53:24,430 --> 03:53:24,830
Yes.

6599
03:53:24,830 --> 03:53:26,550
It's the same for...

6600
03:53:27,170 --> 03:53:33,390
Like my mom especially, she buys like high caffeinated tea leaves and I'm like, Jesus, man.

6601
03:53:36,590 --> 03:53:41,570
Like I keep insisting drink less or something like this, like blue tea or some stuff.

6602
03:53:41,710 --> 03:53:42,650
And she's like, no.

6603
03:53:42,690 --> 03:53:42,830
Oh yeah.

6604
03:53:42,890 --> 03:53:47,010
We need those extra like the Kung Fu tea, you know, like wah.

6605
03:53:48,590 --> 03:53:49,070
Yeah.

6606
03:53:49,270 --> 03:53:49,750
Yeah.

6607
03:53:50,490 --> 03:53:50,970
No.

6608
03:53:51,130 --> 03:53:52,790
People are like, don't start smoking.

6609
03:53:52,890 --> 03:53:53,510
It's very hard to...

6610
03:53:53,510 --> 03:53:54,090
No, that's true.

6611
03:53:54,290 --> 03:53:54,670
That's true.

6612
03:53:55,770 --> 03:54:02,970
It's very hard to quit smoking because it's just going cold turkey is like really like not cold turkey, but like, but like just stopping it.

6613
03:54:02,970 --> 03:54:15,950
And it's like, like I know like in like for my family, like majority is like, like my uncles, my uncles, my dad, my grandparents, they all smoked because it was like, like a bonding thing.

6614
03:54:16,050 --> 03:54:23,490
You know, I don't know what it was for you, but like for like my family, like they would like share cigarettes and stuff for like a bonding thing and a talk while smoking.

6615
03:54:23,490 --> 03:54:24,230
And stuff like that.

6616
03:54:24,230 --> 03:54:25,670
Oh, it's definitely normal.

6617
03:54:25,930 --> 03:54:26,250
Yeah.

6618
03:54:26,250 --> 03:54:26,430
Yeah.

6619
03:54:26,430 --> 03:54:27,490
Social smoking is a thing.

6620
03:54:27,630 --> 03:54:28,110
Yeah.

6621
03:54:28,150 --> 03:54:28,990
I might just do that.

6622
03:54:30,690 --> 03:54:31,170
Yeah.

6623
03:54:32,050 --> 03:54:34,890
So it's like very hard to quit and stuff.

6624
03:54:35,710 --> 03:54:36,190
Yeah.

6625
03:54:36,370 --> 03:54:39,070
It's like a huge cultural thing too.

6626
03:54:41,130 --> 03:54:45,710
So I like grew up around like a family that smoked a lot.

6627
03:54:47,270 --> 03:54:47,750
Yeah.

6628
03:54:47,970 --> 03:54:48,950
I mean same.

6629
03:54:49,730 --> 03:54:50,210
Yeah.

6630
03:54:50,230 --> 03:54:51,030
So it's hard to quit.

6631
03:54:51,050 --> 03:54:51,390
Especially.

6632
03:54:51,730 --> 03:54:51,970
That's why I became a smoker.

6633
03:54:51,970 --> 03:54:52,270
Yeah.

6634
03:54:52,270 --> 03:54:52,410
Yeah.

6635
03:54:52,450 --> 03:54:58,630
Like it's really hard to, because like it's hard to quit just cause like, like, you know, your entire family smoking as well.

6636
03:54:58,730 --> 03:55:03,090
So it's like, it's like, you know, like you're surrounded by a presence of smokers.

6637
03:55:03,090 --> 03:55:09,650
So it's like hard to suddenly stop smoking just cause you know, uh, just cause like, you know, it's awkward.

6638
03:55:10,250 --> 03:55:11,050
So like.

6639
03:55:11,070 --> 03:55:11,790
Yeah, it is.

6640
03:55:12,030 --> 03:55:12,450
Yeah.

6641
03:55:12,470 --> 03:55:12,710
Yeah.

6642
03:55:12,770 --> 03:55:13,410
So, but like.

6643
03:55:13,550 --> 03:55:20,110
And the other reason is that why I'm stopping smoking, cause apparently I'm the only one left who just still smokes.

6644
03:55:20,110 --> 03:55:20,890
Oh yeah.

6645
03:55:20,950 --> 03:55:21,070
Yeah.

6646
03:55:21,070 --> 03:55:23,070
Cause everybody slowly stops smoking for your family.

6647
03:55:23,110 --> 03:55:29,350
Like all of my cousins has got married and they have a son and a child now.

6648
03:55:29,370 --> 03:55:30,710
So I just stopped and I'm like.

6649
03:55:30,810 --> 03:55:31,490
What the fuck?

6650
03:55:31,570 --> 03:55:31,810
Shit.

6651
03:55:32,110 --> 03:55:33,130
The fuck am I doing?

6652
03:55:33,250 --> 03:55:33,350
My dad didn't stop.

6653
03:55:35,290 --> 03:55:36,910
Your dad didn't stop?

6654
03:55:37,110 --> 03:55:38,150
My dad didn't stop.

6655
03:55:38,150 --> 03:55:39,110
Oh, oh same.

6656
03:55:40,250 --> 03:55:40,730
Same.

6657
03:55:41,110 --> 03:55:41,590
Yeah.

6658
03:55:42,210 --> 03:55:44,150
Dad didn't stop smoking.

6659
03:55:44,270 --> 03:55:45,670
Dad, my dad didn't stop.

6660
03:55:46,150 --> 03:55:46,630
Yeah.

6661
03:55:47,030 --> 03:55:48,270
But he stopped.

6662
03:55:48,270 --> 03:55:49,350
I don't smoke though.

6663
03:55:49,410 --> 03:55:50,090
I don't smoke.

6664
03:55:50,410 --> 03:55:50,430
He, he, he.

6665
03:55:50,570 --> 03:55:51,050
I don't smoke.

6666
03:55:51,070 --> 03:55:58,590
He smoked for more than 30 years and he stopped like 2014 or 13.

6667
03:55:58,590 --> 03:56:00,090
My dad's so going.

6668
03:56:00,290 --> 03:56:04,710
He hasn't inhaled any of those in years.

6669
03:56:04,810 --> 03:56:05,330
It's crazy.

6670
03:56:06,230 --> 03:56:07,310
What the fuck?

6671
03:56:07,370 --> 03:56:11,150
Hey, did your dad also stop smoking too, crocodile?

6672
03:56:11,930 --> 03:56:12,510
Yeah.

6673
03:56:13,610 --> 03:56:14,590
But yeah, no.

6674
03:56:14,750 --> 03:56:15,210
He's fine.

6675
03:56:15,810 --> 03:56:26,550
No, when I was growing up, like my dad would like, uh, he would like, uh, I would smoke I think like, he wouldn't smoke in front of me, but like, I could smell the smoke, you know?

6676
03:56:26,670 --> 03:56:27,210
And then...

6677
03:56:27,210 --> 03:56:30,710
The worst, probably for me, is when we're going on a trip.

6678
03:56:30,870 --> 03:56:33,270
He smokes while driving.

6679
03:56:33,610 --> 03:56:35,230
And he just opens the window.

6680
03:56:35,530 --> 03:56:35,890
Oh!

6681
03:56:38,010 --> 03:56:39,050
Oh my god!

6682
03:56:40,070 --> 03:56:42,870
That feels like 2000 Asian dad right there!

6683
03:56:45,610 --> 03:56:46,690
Hell yeah!

6684
03:56:46,690 --> 03:56:52,610
Yeah, yeah, no, my dad, he would just like, go outside like, the balcony, or just go outside the smoke.

6685
03:56:52,790 --> 03:56:53,850
He used to like, just...

6686
03:56:54,790 --> 03:56:58,610
Like, go to like, the bathrooms to smoke.

6687
03:56:58,990 --> 03:57:01,850
Just because like, he didn't want to bring it in the house and stuff.

6688
03:57:02,050 --> 03:57:03,990
Yeah, because there's a fucking exhaust.

6689
03:57:04,370 --> 03:57:06,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

6690
03:57:07,810 --> 03:57:08,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6691
03:57:10,190 --> 03:57:11,970
But I remember like...

6692
03:57:11,970 --> 03:57:16,250
Because like, I remember when I was really young, because like, you know, I was raised in Canada.

6693
03:57:16,250 --> 03:57:18,470
And then, you know, they're like, Smokey's really, really bad!

6694
03:57:19,090 --> 03:57:20,010
Like, it's so bad!

6695
03:57:20,150 --> 03:57:23,570
I mean, it is bad, but like, it's like, in your face more so than like...

6696
03:57:24,670 --> 03:57:26,750
Like, it was like, it's like, so in your face.

6697
03:57:26,850 --> 03:57:28,070
So I would be like, stop smoking!

6698
03:57:29,070 --> 03:57:29,710
And then...

6699
03:57:30,310 --> 03:57:34,210
And then, I don't know if you've ever seen, you know, like, those museums where it's like...

6700
03:57:35,170 --> 03:57:38,190
It's like, those like, human body museum, where...

6701
03:57:38,690 --> 03:57:40,150
You know, you know what I'm talking about?

6702
03:57:40,530 --> 03:57:42,810
It shows like, oh, the body of a smoker.

6703
03:57:43,110 --> 03:57:43,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

6704
03:57:44,190 --> 03:57:46,230
And then they're like, this is the lungs of a smoker!

6705
03:57:47,210 --> 03:57:51,190
And this is like, the lungs of a person who doesn't smoke!

6706
03:57:51,410 --> 03:57:55,090
And then I would point, and then we would visit those museums, and I'd be like, Dad, that's you!

6707
03:57:55,750 --> 03:57:57,350
These are your lungs!

6708
03:57:58,110 --> 03:57:59,230
I used to do that.

6709
03:57:59,350 --> 03:58:01,990
And then I became a smoker, and I saw it, and I just laughed.

6710
03:58:02,390 --> 03:58:03,850
And then, oh my god.

6711
03:58:08,010 --> 03:58:16,230
Yeah, I mean like, yeah, I don't... like, he used to, when I was younger, I noticed it more, but like, I think as I got older, like, he... my dad...

6712
03:58:16,250 --> 03:58:19,670
My dad does like, go outside, like, try to hide it more in front of me.

6713
03:58:20,990 --> 03:58:22,470
Then... but he hasn't quit yet.

6714
03:58:22,990 --> 03:58:23,430
Yeah.

6715
03:58:23,530 --> 03:58:27,890
Honestly, for me, as a kid, I didn't get, what the fuck, why is he smoking?

6716
03:58:28,090 --> 03:58:30,990
It's just wasting money, even though it was so dirt cheap back then.

6717
03:58:31,050 --> 03:58:32,250
It was 50 cents.

6718
03:58:32,510 --> 03:58:34,450
Oh yeah, like, Indonesia, yeah.

6719
03:58:34,890 --> 03:58:36,570
Yeah, it was like 50 cents.

6720
03:58:36,670 --> 03:58:38,430
And then, now it's like $2.

6721
03:58:39,430 --> 03:58:42,950
It's still cheap, but holy fuck, it's expensive in Indonesia.

6722
03:58:43,030 --> 03:58:45,950
Is it like taxes, or just like, trying to make people stop smoking?

6723
03:58:45,970 --> 03:58:46,230
Is it like taxes, or just like, trying to make people stop smoking?

6724
03:58:46,230 --> 03:58:47,150
It's both.

6725
03:58:47,490 --> 03:58:50,270
And either way, there's always a cheaper cigarette.

6726
03:58:50,710 --> 03:58:51,150
Yeah.

6727
03:58:51,390 --> 03:58:51,550
Literally.

6728
03:58:52,810 --> 03:58:55,790
But my... the one I smoke, it's like $2.

6729
03:58:56,350 --> 03:58:59,090
Yeah, like, yeah, it's just a lot of money to spend.

6730
03:58:59,290 --> 03:59:02,090
It's like... it's like a whole meal for the day.

6731
03:59:02,190 --> 03:59:03,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6732
03:59:04,370 --> 03:59:05,330
Oh yeah, I understand.

6733
03:59:05,890 --> 03:59:07,110
Well, I hope it works.

6734
03:59:07,110 --> 03:59:08,350
I hope it works out for you.

6735
03:59:08,490 --> 03:59:08,670
Yeah.

6736
03:59:09,010 --> 03:59:11,510
Because you would save a lot of money, and also be healthier too.

6737
03:59:11,590 --> 03:59:12,050
Oh, definitely.

6738
03:59:12,230 --> 03:59:15,830
I started to make, like, every time I think...

6739
03:59:15,830 --> 03:59:16,870
Should I buy a cigarette?

6740
03:59:16,990 --> 03:59:24,070
I will just straight up open my mobile banking and just deposit to another saving for the same price of the cigarette.

6741
03:59:25,270 --> 03:59:26,010
That's smart.

6742
03:59:26,150 --> 03:59:26,990
That's really smart.

6743
03:59:27,390 --> 03:59:27,830
Yeah.

6744
03:59:28,450 --> 03:59:28,850
Yeah.

6745
03:59:29,990 --> 03:59:30,630
Yeah, that's good for you.

6746
03:59:30,630 --> 03:59:32,370
I'm like, how much do I have in there, saving?

6747
03:59:32,510 --> 03:59:33,230
Let me just...

6748
03:59:33,230 --> 03:59:35,270
How much do I have in there?

6749
03:59:35,950 --> 03:59:36,390
I...

6750
03:59:37,770 --> 03:59:39,030
Yeah, that's really good.

6751
03:59:39,190 --> 03:59:40,170
I have about $48.

6752
03:59:41,810 --> 03:59:42,690
Holy shit.

6753
03:59:42,870 --> 03:59:43,850
Since you started?

6754
03:59:43,850 --> 03:59:44,590
When did you start?

6755
03:59:45,770 --> 03:59:47,370
Like, like, stop smoking?

6756
03:59:47,810 --> 03:59:48,210
Yeah.

6757
03:59:48,390 --> 03:59:49,510
Like, a couple of weeks from now.

6758
03:59:49,650 --> 03:59:50,310
A couple of weeks?

6759
03:59:50,310 --> 03:59:51,390
Oh my god, okay.

6760
03:59:51,530 --> 03:59:52,130
It's been a...

6761
03:59:52,130 --> 03:59:53,610
Yeah, and it's like a pack, right?

6762
03:59:53,790 --> 03:59:54,830
$2 a pack.

6763
03:59:55,230 --> 03:59:55,630
So...

6764
03:59:55,630 --> 03:59:57,010
I think it's almost a month.

6765
03:59:57,190 --> 03:59:58,750
Oh my god, that's a lot.

6766
03:59:59,590 --> 03:59:59,990
Yeah.

6767
04:00:00,050 --> 04:00:04,250
That's... I remember, because like, I remember you used to smoke a lot too.

6768
04:00:05,750 --> 04:00:06,150
Yeah.

6769
04:00:06,150 --> 04:00:06,770
A lot, a lot.

6770
04:00:06,970 --> 04:00:09,910
So like, I hope, like, I honestly hope it goes well.

6771
04:00:09,970 --> 04:00:11,110
And that you can, like...

6772
04:00:11,110 --> 04:00:11,310
Yeah.

6773
04:00:11,490 --> 04:00:12,670
You don't fall...

6774
04:00:12,670 --> 04:00:13,130
Fuck.

6775
04:00:13,130 --> 04:00:15,610
Like, it's good that a lot of the people also stop too.

6776
04:00:15,810 --> 04:00:17,490
Like, your... the people around you stop.

6777
04:00:17,490 --> 04:00:18,290
It's really hard to stop.

6778
04:00:18,350 --> 04:00:21,210
Since Indonesian cigarettes are really good.

6779
04:00:21,370 --> 04:00:24,010
And oh my god, it's so fucking hard to stop.

6780
04:00:24,410 --> 04:00:28,570
Yeah, and all... but it's also good that, like, your relatives also stop smoking.

6781
04:00:28,910 --> 04:00:32,790
So like, it's easier to, like, you don't get, like, influenced by others.

6782
04:00:33,410 --> 04:00:38,310
To, like, stop smoking, you know, to, like, start smoking, you know, because it's not in front of you and stuff.

6783
04:00:38,610 --> 04:00:40,570
And as long as you don't go outside...

6784
04:00:42,130 --> 04:00:42,530
Yeah.

6785
04:00:42,710 --> 04:00:43,110
Yeah.

6786
04:00:43,110 --> 04:00:44,970
You don't see the people smoking.

6787
04:00:45,550 --> 04:00:54,030
My only problem is that... I don't know how to say it in English, but like, Indonesian people tend to, like, just smoke when they're bored.

6788
04:00:54,370 --> 04:00:55,510
Yeah, no, I get that.

6789
04:00:55,510 --> 04:00:57,090
Like, they don't have anything to do.

6790
04:00:57,170 --> 04:00:57,430
Yeah.

6791
04:00:57,430 --> 04:00:59,830
And they don't want to think over so much stuff.

6792
04:00:59,930 --> 04:01:02,450
So they'll just go outside and just light up one.

6793
04:01:03,010 --> 04:01:03,450
Yeah.

6794
04:01:03,470 --> 04:01:03,610
That's me.

6795
04:01:04,290 --> 04:01:06,090
That's what I find it hard right now.

6796
04:01:06,130 --> 04:01:08,050
I am... I'm very bored sometimes.

6797
04:01:08,170 --> 04:01:10,630
Yeah, and that's why we have Izatsudon here.

6798
04:01:10,730 --> 04:01:12,490
That's why we have our podcast.

6799
04:01:12,490 --> 04:01:13,990
Yes, I am...

6800
04:01:15,470 --> 04:01:18,930
Especially with three hours, I just, like, had a coffee and...

6801
04:01:19,770 --> 04:01:26,990
But yeah, I hope... I hope it goes well to everybody else who's also trying to stop an addiction.

6802
04:01:27,330 --> 04:01:38,290
I hope, like, you guys are able to handle it and, like, being able to, like, you know, at least... or swap to, like, an addiction that's, like, a lot healthier and stuff.

6803
04:01:38,350 --> 04:01:41,490
Ever heard of... ever heard of opening loot boxes?

6804
04:01:41,490 --> 04:01:42,650
I just work.

6805
04:01:45,730 --> 04:01:46,490
That's true.

6806
04:01:46,490 --> 04:01:46,590
That's true.

6807
04:01:46,590 --> 04:01:48,070
My free time is just work now.

6808
04:01:48,210 --> 04:01:51,230
So, like, I don't have... I don't have time to be addicted to anything.

6809
04:01:52,350 --> 04:01:54,010
Dude, I wish I could.

6810
04:01:54,810 --> 04:01:57,710
I really have no time to be addicted to things.

6811
04:01:57,710 --> 04:01:58,710
But you know what I'm glad... you know what I'm glad?

6812
04:01:59,050 --> 04:02:02,250
The thing is, I live in Indonesia, right?

6813
04:02:02,270 --> 04:02:02,490
Yeah.

6814
04:02:02,490 --> 04:02:03,690
Gambling is illegal.

6815
04:02:04,170 --> 04:02:05,030
Holy fuck.

6816
04:02:05,170 --> 04:02:05,470
Yeah.

6817
04:02:05,470 --> 04:02:07,210
I would probably jump in that.

6818
04:02:07,270 --> 04:02:08,070
Yeah, holy shit.

6819
04:02:08,070 --> 04:02:09,090
I'm glad gambling's illegal.

6820
04:02:09,510 --> 04:02:10,010
Yeah.

6821
04:02:10,070 --> 04:02:10,570
Yeah.

6822
04:02:11,530 --> 04:02:14,090
I mean, I'm banned in a few casinos, but hey, man.

6823
04:02:14,190 --> 04:02:16,450
You're banned in a few... what did you do?

6824
04:02:16,850 --> 04:02:18,030
Did you count cards?

6825
04:02:18,550 --> 04:02:19,390
Uh, I win.

6826
04:02:19,890 --> 04:02:21,430
You count cards, don't you?

6827
04:02:21,510 --> 04:02:22,330
You count cards.

6828
04:02:22,590 --> 04:02:22,730
No.

6829
04:02:23,010 --> 04:02:24,070
Then how do you win?

6830
04:02:25,070 --> 04:02:26,110
Yeah, well, math.

6831
04:02:26,510 --> 04:02:27,430
You count cards!

6832
04:02:27,990 --> 04:02:28,890
Nuh-uh, it's math.

6833
04:02:29,230 --> 04:02:29,550
It's...

6834
04:02:30,490 --> 04:02:31,010
Nuh-uh.

6835
04:02:32,370 --> 04:02:33,250
Counting cards?

6836
04:02:33,830 --> 04:02:37,150
Math is... math is numbers.

6837
04:02:37,610 --> 04:02:40,210
I was like, uh, give me... give me your ID.

6838
04:02:40,210 --> 04:02:45,850
Like, you know, I was turning on my chips and then they're like, oh, can I see your passports?

6839
04:02:45,950 --> 04:02:46,250
Uh...

6840
04:02:46,250 --> 04:02:50,130
Okay, I don't understand how counting cards is banned because it's just playing the game better.

6841
04:02:50,970 --> 04:02:55,410
Like, it literally just... it's just a smart person playing a game better.

6842
04:02:55,730 --> 04:02:55,910
It's just math.

6843
04:02:55,910 --> 04:02:57,370
I don't understand why it's...

6844
04:02:57,370 --> 04:02:58,990
I don't understand why it's...

6845
04:02:58,990 --> 04:03:00,330
Like, I don't even need to count it.

6846
04:03:00,390 --> 04:03:01,010
I already know.

6847
04:03:01,050 --> 04:03:02,990
It shouldn't be... it's not illegal.

6848
04:03:03,110 --> 04:03:04,790
It's just you don't want them to win.

6849
04:03:04,950 --> 04:03:06,630
Like, that's basically it.

6850
04:03:08,550 --> 04:03:09,890
Well, I don't play poker.

6851
04:03:09,970 --> 04:03:10,190
That's the thing.

6852
04:03:10,190 --> 04:03:10,670
I play...

6853
04:03:10,670 --> 04:03:14,050
I don't want you to win money.

6854
04:03:14,130 --> 04:03:14,370
Yeah.

6855
04:03:14,470 --> 04:03:20,750
That's why, like, you need to count cards and then win a little bit of money and then leave and then come back another time.

6856
04:03:20,890 --> 04:03:21,930
A later date.

6857
04:03:22,010 --> 04:03:26,710
So you don't, like, you... you can... you can still... you slowly leech money off of them.

6858
04:03:27,610 --> 04:03:28,430
Yeah, that's why.

6859
04:03:28,510 --> 04:03:29,510
They didn't kick me off.

6860
04:03:29,610 --> 04:03:36,950
But then when they asked... asked me for my passport, I was like, hmm, you're banning me, aren't you?

6861
04:03:37,050 --> 04:03:38,770
Yeah, because it's a private property.

6862
04:03:38,850 --> 04:03:39,790
They own it.

6863
04:03:39,790 --> 04:03:41,710
So it's like, of course, they can ban you.

6864
04:03:43,410 --> 04:03:44,530
They're banning me.

6865
04:03:44,830 --> 04:03:45,970
That's why you play...

6866
04:03:45,970 --> 04:03:55,010
Yeah, but... and that's why, like... and you can't even do, like, online poker, like, online gambling regarding, like, counting cards... using counting cards because it's all an algorithm.

6867
04:03:56,990 --> 04:03:57,790
It's an algorithm.

6868
04:03:57,950 --> 04:04:01,810
It's not like you can actually, like, out... you can't really outgame the algorithm.

6869
04:04:02,770 --> 04:04:06,530
I won, like, $800, $700, I think.

6870
04:04:06,670 --> 04:04:07,270
Like, yeah.

6871
04:04:07,750 --> 04:04:08,750
It's not that much.

6872
04:04:08,750 --> 04:04:10,890
But they were, like, stupidly counting it.

6873
04:04:11,730 --> 04:04:12,750
Like, what the fuck?

6874
04:04:13,650 --> 04:04:14,170
Yeah.

6875
04:04:15,050 --> 04:04:17,230
Oh, oh, what the fuck?

6876
04:04:17,310 --> 04:04:19,210
There's a hundred... don't... what?

6877
04:04:19,550 --> 04:04:19,810
What?

6878
04:04:20,070 --> 04:04:20,930
You got an akka?

6879
04:04:21,570 --> 04:04:22,990
Someone donated a hundred.

6880
04:04:23,590 --> 04:04:24,110
That's...

6881
04:04:24,110 --> 04:04:24,730
Yo!

6882
04:04:24,810 --> 04:04:25,630
Who is it?

6883
04:04:26,590 --> 04:04:27,110
Rita.

6884
04:04:27,650 --> 04:04:28,170
Rita!

6885
04:04:28,330 --> 04:04:29,610
Thanks for the akka super!

6886
04:04:30,070 --> 04:04:31,110
Thank you, thank you!

6887
04:04:31,430 --> 04:04:32,690
Dude, dude, dude, what the fuck?

6888
04:04:32,690 --> 04:04:33,190
What's the message?

6889
04:04:33,410 --> 04:04:34,230
What was the message?

6890
04:04:34,690 --> 04:04:35,790
What the fuck?

6891
04:04:36,230 --> 04:04:37,650
What was the message, Tengen?

6892
04:04:37,650 --> 04:04:38,730
They're traveling right now in Salwa.

6893
04:04:38,730 --> 04:04:40,630
Oh, I wish I could watch the whole collab.

6894
04:04:40,990 --> 04:04:43,790
Oh, she's traveling and she donated a hundred.

6895
04:04:43,910 --> 04:04:44,250
That's crazy.

6896
04:04:44,310 --> 04:04:45,650
Oh my god, thanks, Rita!

6897
04:04:46,010 --> 04:04:49,030
You know, Rita surpassed you in the rank, by the way.

6898
04:04:49,330 --> 04:04:50,610
Oh, they surpassed me?

6899
04:04:50,730 --> 04:04:51,430
Oh, nice!

6900
04:04:51,570 --> 04:04:52,010
Yeah.

6901
04:04:52,390 --> 04:04:53,050
That's insane.

6902
04:04:53,670 --> 04:04:54,110
Good.

6903
04:04:54,210 --> 04:04:55,330
Good, thank god.

6904
04:04:56,270 --> 04:05:00,650
I was like, you can't... you can't do this to me, man.

6905
04:05:00,790 --> 04:05:02,410
You can't do this to me.

6906
04:05:02,530 --> 04:05:02,550
Jesus Christ.

6907
04:05:03,410 --> 04:05:04,290
Jesus Christ.

6908
04:05:05,230 --> 04:05:06,750
That gave me a heart attack.

6909
04:05:07,570 --> 04:05:08,490
Drawing your ocean.

6910
04:05:08,490 --> 04:05:08,970
That's good!

6911
04:05:09,050 --> 04:05:10,530
She having a habit filing your taxes.

6912
04:05:10,530 --> 04:05:11,110
You need a hundred akka!

6913
04:05:12,030 --> 04:05:12,430
That's good!

6914
04:05:12,530 --> 04:05:13,410
Good for you, man!

6915
04:05:13,910 --> 04:05:15,270
I'm glad you're getting that money!

6916
04:05:16,510 --> 04:05:19,650
Yeah, you get to keep a hundred percent of it, remember that!

6917
04:05:20,910 --> 04:05:22,250
Yeah, not a hundred percent.

6918
04:05:22,390 --> 04:05:22,710
PayPal takes...

6919
04:05:22,710 --> 04:05:23,770
I mean, oh yeah, thirty percent.

6920
04:05:24,010 --> 04:05:24,290
Sorry.

6921
04:05:24,390 --> 04:05:25,390
Wait, PayPal takes like...

6922
04:05:25,390 --> 04:05:27,910
Oh, wait, no, you do Streamlabs, so it's like...

6923
04:05:27,910 --> 04:05:28,550
Yeah, Streamlabs.

6924
04:05:29,610 --> 04:05:31,050
Uh... so it's like, what was it?

6925
04:05:31,110 --> 04:05:32,970
It's like five percent or some shit?

6926
04:05:33,150 --> 04:05:33,950
Five to ten percent?

6927
04:05:34,770 --> 04:05:35,150
Right.

6928
04:05:36,010 --> 04:05:36,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6929
04:05:37,090 --> 04:05:38,470
Oh, hey, I got an akka too!

6930
04:05:39,930 --> 04:05:40,750
That's insane!

6931
04:05:41,210 --> 04:05:41,430
Oh my god!

6932
04:05:41,550 --> 04:05:42,810
Arch, thank you for the akka soup!

6933
04:05:42,930 --> 04:05:43,990
Thank you, thank you!

6934
04:05:44,010 --> 04:05:45,230
I wish I could watch the whole collab.

6935
04:05:45,370 --> 04:05:48,130
That's why you were gonna watch the VOD later!

6936
04:05:49,330 --> 04:05:50,990
VOD's there, don't worry about it.

6937
04:05:51,090 --> 04:05:51,530
Yeah!

6938
04:05:51,630 --> 04:05:52,330
The game's goofy.

6939
04:05:52,670 --> 04:05:53,110
Yeah!

6940
04:05:53,470 --> 04:06:02,350
Guys, yeah, you guys gotta watch the whole VOD so you can get the podcast section too, with number six right here, like, hanging out with us too.

6941
04:06:03,230 --> 04:06:04,050
Number six.

6942
04:06:04,510 --> 04:06:05,170
You know what?

6943
04:06:05,190 --> 04:06:08,310
That goes to my new power supply and graphics card.

6944
04:06:08,370 --> 04:06:08,470
Oh, yeah.

6945
04:06:10,030 --> 04:06:12,830
The moment you get a new graphics card, we should play Remnant.

6946
04:06:13,810 --> 04:06:16,110
I hope I can get that graphics card too.

6947
04:06:16,290 --> 04:06:16,870
Yeah, that's fine.

6948
04:06:17,270 --> 04:06:18,570
Remnant's always gonna be there.

6949
04:06:18,690 --> 04:06:19,310
It's all pricey!

6950
04:06:19,770 --> 04:06:20,290
It's gonna be there.

6951
04:06:20,330 --> 04:06:24,110
Okay, just wait until the 500 series comes out, and then you can buy a 40.

6952
04:06:24,670 --> 04:06:25,790
Oh, yeah, you know what?

6953
04:06:25,850 --> 04:06:26,490
You're so right.

6954
04:06:26,630 --> 04:06:27,690
You're so fucking right.

6955
04:06:27,690 --> 04:06:33,670
Literally just wait until the 500 series comes out, and then fucking the 40s are gonna drop by like 50 percent or some shit.

6956
04:06:34,050 --> 04:06:35,090
You're so right.

6957
04:06:35,310 --> 04:06:35,730
Holy.

6958
04:06:36,530 --> 04:06:38,230
It's gonna come out eventually.

6959
04:06:38,750 --> 04:06:40,190
When did the 40s come out?

6960
04:06:42,010 --> 04:06:43,270
I'm not sure, actually.

6961
04:06:43,550 --> 04:06:46,770
It usually takes like, what, two to three years for a new card?

6962
04:06:47,750 --> 04:06:48,270
Right?

6963
04:06:48,470 --> 04:06:48,810
I think it's a year.

6964
04:06:49,270 --> 04:06:50,830
No, it's not a year.

6965
04:06:50,830 --> 04:06:52,830
It's like two years, I feel like.

6966
04:06:52,930 --> 04:06:54,510
I just need that encoding.

6967
04:06:55,470 --> 04:06:55,990
Yeah.

6968
04:06:56,530 --> 04:06:58,070
Or just buy a 30.

6969
04:06:58,390 --> 04:07:02,790
Most of my Indonesian viewers are watching with their mobile data.

6970
04:07:04,170 --> 04:07:04,710
And then...

6971
04:07:04,710 --> 04:07:05,550
It'll be a crocodile.

6972
04:07:05,550 --> 04:07:05,710
Yeah.

6973
04:07:05,730 --> 04:07:07,030
We're having a podcast.

6974
04:07:07,450 --> 04:07:07,890
And then the bitrate's crazy.

6975
04:07:09,150 --> 04:07:11,770
The bitrate go crazy for mobile data.

6976
04:07:12,650 --> 04:07:13,490
Oh, shit.

6977
04:07:13,590 --> 04:07:14,030
Yeah.

6978
04:07:15,050 --> 04:07:18,730
Or just buy 300 series after they announce the 5,000.

6979
04:07:20,010 --> 04:07:23,570
The 3,000 does not increase that much of my performance.

6980
04:07:23,990 --> 04:07:26,950
And I guess waiting for the 4,000 to drop price is better.

6981
04:07:27,270 --> 04:07:28,850
Yeah, just save up for the 4,000.

6982
04:07:29,630 --> 04:07:30,130
Aye.

6983
04:07:31,550 --> 04:07:32,050
Yeah.

6984
04:07:32,290 --> 04:07:34,650
Somebody said the 39 should be a good deal now.

6985
04:07:34,890 --> 04:07:35,710
I don't know if that was the case.

6986
04:07:35,710 --> 04:07:36,110
Yeah.

6987
04:07:36,130 --> 04:07:36,390
Oh, yeah.

6988
04:07:36,450 --> 04:07:37,250
That's the thing.

6989
04:07:37,250 --> 04:07:38,730
I can't find a 3090.

6990
04:07:38,970 --> 04:07:39,910
That's the thing.

6991
04:07:39,970 --> 04:07:40,130
Oh.

6992
04:07:41,110 --> 04:07:45,370
Like most of people who bought the 3090s use for, you know, what?

6993
04:07:45,490 --> 04:07:46,470
Oh, for mining?

6994
04:07:46,610 --> 04:07:46,930
Mining stuff.

6995
04:07:47,150 --> 04:07:47,330
Yeah.

6996
04:07:47,410 --> 04:07:47,690
Yeah.

6997
04:07:47,790 --> 04:07:49,010
I mean, yeah.

6998
04:07:49,050 --> 04:07:50,470
I can't find a good one.

6999
04:07:50,990 --> 04:07:51,470
Yeah.

7000
04:07:51,810 --> 04:07:53,030
For mining bitcoin.

7001
04:07:54,230 --> 04:07:54,710
Yep.

7002
04:07:54,710 --> 04:07:54,910
Yep.

7003
04:07:55,090 --> 04:07:56,290
And NFTs.

7004
04:07:57,850 --> 04:07:59,630
Black Show Pals, thanks for the super chat.

7005
04:07:59,770 --> 04:08:00,750
Good luck on all the drafts.

7006
04:08:00,750 --> 04:08:01,190
Yeah!

7007
04:08:01,190 --> 04:08:01,310
Thank you!

7008
04:08:02,630 --> 04:08:05,010
That was a nice podcast that we had.

7009
04:08:06,370 --> 04:08:07,230
Should have more.

7010
04:08:07,490 --> 04:08:12,270
The random podcast in the middle of...

7011
04:08:12,990 --> 04:08:14,250
In the middle of...

7012
04:08:14,250 --> 04:08:15,950
In the middle of the wilderness of...

7013
04:08:15,950 --> 04:08:16,050
What's human.

7014
04:08:17,810 --> 04:08:18,810
It was great.

7015
04:08:19,030 --> 04:08:20,150
I had a great time, Penjin.

7016
04:08:20,370 --> 04:08:21,350
And number six.

7017
04:08:21,610 --> 04:08:22,930
Thanks for building my house.

7018
04:08:23,650 --> 04:08:25,030
Number six, the MVP.

7019
04:08:25,250 --> 04:08:26,130
He's the real guy.

7020
04:08:26,370 --> 04:08:27,210
He's the man.

7021
04:08:27,230 --> 04:08:28,530
You know what was the MVP part?

7022
04:08:28,610 --> 04:08:32,790
He knew I was never gonna come back to the house, but he still built it.

7023
04:08:33,810 --> 04:08:41,730
He knew I was never coming back to this place, but he still did it for us.

7024
04:08:42,690 --> 04:08:43,210
Yeah.

7025
04:08:44,550 --> 04:08:45,590
He's real.

7026
04:08:46,730 --> 04:08:48,470
That's a real dragoon right there.

7027
04:08:48,610 --> 04:08:49,470
What a legend.

7028
04:08:50,750 --> 04:08:52,290
Not a fucking legend.

7029
04:08:53,710 --> 04:08:55,330
Yeah, this place shall be a monument.

7030
04:08:55,530 --> 04:08:57,470
I don't know if the thing will still be here.

7031
04:08:57,490 --> 04:08:59,810
Yeah, I don't know if they do wipes or anything, but...

7032
04:09:00,550 --> 04:09:02,190
Remember this place, guys.

7033
04:09:02,250 --> 04:09:04,070
This will be the newest tourist destination.

7034
04:09:04,610 --> 04:09:05,650
Historical moment.

7035
04:09:05,850 --> 04:09:13,330
Yeah, the tourist destination where Doki and Tenjin had their first day and only day in Wonsu.

7036
04:09:13,550 --> 04:09:17,250
The first and the last days of Doki and Tenjin.

7037
04:09:18,270 --> 04:09:19,550
It'd be like, oh my god.

7038
04:09:19,590 --> 04:09:20,290
It was like a tour.

7039
04:09:20,370 --> 04:09:22,370
Those tours were historical tours.

7040
04:09:22,370 --> 04:09:27,910
And here, folks, is where Doki and Tenjin had their one hour podcast.

7041
04:09:28,170 --> 04:09:29,590
Right here on that back.

7042
04:09:30,690 --> 04:09:31,590
Right here.

7043
04:09:38,050 --> 04:09:38,690
GG's, man.

7044
04:09:39,570 --> 04:09:40,050
GG's.

7045
04:09:40,130 --> 04:09:41,010
I had a great time.

7046
04:09:41,250 --> 04:09:42,230
It was great hanging out with you.

7047
04:09:43,490 --> 04:09:47,430
If you're looking for a friend to collab with or play stupid games, I'm honestly down.

7048
04:09:47,450 --> 04:09:47,870
Of course, man.

7049
04:09:47,870 --> 04:09:50,130
I've been looking for some stupid games instead of FPS.

7050
04:09:50,330 --> 04:09:51,690
Yeah, of course, dude.

7051
04:09:51,690 --> 04:09:52,150
We're playing Steam together.

7052
04:09:52,550 --> 04:09:53,450
Oh my god, no.

7053
04:09:53,450 --> 04:09:54,390
I played Steam.

7054
04:09:54,710 --> 04:09:56,290
I saw the stream.

7055
04:09:56,750 --> 04:09:58,330
I saw the stream you did, yeah.

7056
04:09:59,970 --> 04:10:01,770
It's honestly... it doesn't make me mad.

7057
04:10:02,010 --> 04:10:04,490
It's just... I'm tired of laughing in that game.

7058
04:10:05,030 --> 04:10:10,510
Alright, I'm gonna go talk to my dragoons now.

7059
04:10:10,750 --> 04:10:11,430
Wait, what did you do?

7060
04:10:11,690 --> 04:10:12,630
Look at my leg.

7061
04:10:12,890 --> 04:10:14,050
What the fuck?

7062
04:10:15,450 --> 04:10:16,830
You see what I'm seeing?

7063
04:10:17,890 --> 04:10:18,850
What the fuck?

7064
04:10:19,750 --> 04:10:20,610
Oh my god.

7065
04:10:20,610 --> 04:10:22,670
Alright, I am... oh my god.

7066
04:10:22,730 --> 04:10:23,310
I see.

7067
04:10:23,370 --> 04:10:24,230
Now I know what you mean.

7068
04:10:24,390 --> 04:10:24,470
Yeah.

7069
04:10:27,770 --> 04:10:29,710
Now I know what you mean.

7070
04:10:30,610 --> 04:10:31,530
Oh my god.

7071
04:10:31,730 --> 04:10:34,190
Alright, I'm gonna go talk to my dragoons now.

7072
04:10:34,250 --> 04:10:35,410
But it was nice hanging out, man.

7073
04:10:36,210 --> 04:10:36,850
Yeah, man.

7074
04:10:37,070 --> 04:10:38,130
Appreciate for the invite.

7075
04:10:38,170 --> 04:10:38,570
Thanks.

7076
04:10:38,670 --> 04:10:39,150
Yeah, of course.

7077
04:10:39,530 --> 04:10:39,930
Of course.

7078
04:10:40,390 --> 04:10:41,670
I'll see you next time, dude.

7079
04:10:42,650 --> 04:10:43,050
Yeah.

7080
04:10:43,150 --> 04:10:43,550
Yeah.

7081
04:10:43,730 --> 04:10:44,130
Alright.

7082
04:10:45,190 --> 04:10:45,590
GG's.

7083
04:10:46,490 --> 04:10:46,890
GG's.

7084
04:10:46,990 --> 04:10:47,530
Bye bye.

7085
04:10:49,410 --> 04:10:49,810
Bye.

7086
04:10:51,330 --> 04:10:51,770
Oh!

7087
04:10:52,330 --> 04:10:52,770
Wow.

7088
04:10:52,950 --> 04:10:54,510
I did not expect to stream this long.

7089
04:10:54,570 --> 04:11:00,830
We had two back to back collabs that went on for like But it was fun.

7090
04:11:01,110 --> 04:11:02,130
I had a great conversation.

7091
04:11:02,790 --> 04:11:03,230
Um.

7092
04:11:03,450 --> 04:11:06,490
We had our impromptu podcast and everything.

7093
04:11:07,170 --> 04:11:07,610
Um.

7094
04:11:08,950 --> 04:11:11,210
And I had a great time just hanging out.

7095
04:11:11,250 --> 04:11:13,810
Just chatting, and hanging out with you guys.

7096
04:11:14,030 --> 04:11:15,610
As well as with Tenjin!

7097
04:11:15,770 --> 04:11:16,470
And… number 6!

7098
04:11:16,470 --> 04:11:16,570
Six!

7099
04:11:20,550 --> 04:11:22,670
That was a great time, honestly.

7100
04:11:22,950 --> 04:11:23,430
It was.

7101
04:11:23,470 --> 04:11:24,090
It was a fun collab.

7102
04:11:25,390 --> 04:11:26,810
I... am tired.

7103
04:11:28,950 --> 04:11:32,370
But... I hope you guys enjoyed the stream.

7104
04:11:33,310 --> 04:11:36,210
I know the game was like, you know...

7105
04:11:37,190 --> 04:11:40,710
It was not what we expected, but it was still fun, though.

7106
04:11:42,130 --> 04:11:44,830
And I hope you guys had a great time.

So, I'm gonna call it here, guys.

As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7112

And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

7113
04:12:00,530 --> 04:12:01,870
Because you deserve it!

7114
04:12:02,170 --> 04:12:03,630
