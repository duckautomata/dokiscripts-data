1
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,160
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,100
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,180
Oh my gosh.

4
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,980
Okay, I have several life updates to do.

5
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,580
Also, if I sound... I did have a little session with my sound team today, earlier today.

6
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,340
So I might sound a little different again.

7
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,420
Every stream in the last three days, I sound a little different.

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,980
But like, each day is an improvement.

9
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,220
So I had like a session.

10
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,640
I have a pop filter now.

11
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:30,580
So now, now when I say pepperoni pizza, my pop sound, it's not as popping as it was before.

12
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,320
So it doesn't pound like I'm popping at you, right?

13
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,040
Pound!

14
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,400
My pops!

15
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,500
Give my pepperoni pizza pops!

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
Oh shit.

17
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,380
Preposterous!

18
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,940
So I got my pop filters now.

19
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,960
Anyway, this is one life update.

20
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,400
Do you remember when I said I was never going to order from overheat?

21
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,640
Okay, so I forgot to do grocery shopping today.

22
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,460
You know, like getting my groceries delivered today.

23
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
I forgot to do that.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,220
So today I have to order Uber Eats.

25
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,820
And so I forgot about, you know, being like, I will never do it again because of all these problems.

26
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,520
These problems that I've been having.

27
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,800
And then, so I was like, you know what?

28
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,880
I'll do it.

29
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,820
It's just going to be one order.

30
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,520
It's the weakest boycott ever.

31
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,540
So I was like, all right, I'll just order it.

32
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,080
I'll order groceries for tomorrow for it to arrive.

33
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,400
So I ordered it from this sushi place that I really like.

34
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,440
And I was so looking forward to it because it's like really, it's a really good place.

35
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,860
And I ordered a bento box that was $45.

36
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,000
And I was like, so looking forward to it because it has some like nice, bougie shit in that bento box.

37
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,700
Some like nice, bougie rolls in there.

38
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,580
So I was like, ooh, okay, I really want to try this bento box.

39
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
And so I was like, you know, I'm going to treat myself.

40
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm going to treat myself because the last couple of days, um, so like I've been like trying to be on a strict, like a healthier eating schedule.

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
So like today, I was like, you know what, I'm going to treat myself and order something nice.

42
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240
Because the last couple of days, I've just been eating like bread.

43
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,680
I was eating, I've been eating a slice of bread.

44
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,920
Cover it with brie, like, you know, like I use a brie cheese spread on it.

45
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,480
Um, and, uh, you put like, you know, turkey, a turkey slice or like chicken slice.

46
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,220
And then I'm like, um, that's my meal for the day.

47
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,480
Like that, not the day, for that, I'll eat like one slice for a meal.

48
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,900
And I'll be like, um, all right, that's good enough.

49
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,940
That's, not a day, but like, you know, I'd be like, all right, that's lunchtime.

50
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,740
Or I eat salad.

51
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,080
I have salad too.

52
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,480
So I would be like, all right, salad.

53
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,400
So I've been doing that for like the last like two weeks or so.

54
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,240
Or like, well, not every day.

55
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,020
You know, I would have like, you know, cheat days where I'd be like, okay, let me have something not healthy.

56
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,360
And... I'm trying to change my living... living life, okay?

57
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm trying to be more healthy.

58
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,640
Guys, okay.

59
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,800
Also, I might have, like, splurged a little bit.

60
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,120
Because I got... I was like, I need to start moving more.

61
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,680
But I don't want to go outside.

62
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,500
Or go downstairs to my apartment gym.

63
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,820
So I bought myself a... a exercise bike.

64
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,580
Even though I have a gym that's, like, just in... just, like, below me.

65
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,200
Um... I wanna... exercise more.

66
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,860
But, like, I don't wanna go downstairs.

67
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:12,920
I... I don't wanna go downstairs.

68
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,380
There's so many people downstairs, too.

69
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,640
I don't want them to, like... I don't know.

70
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,760
I don't wanna watch me.

71
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,440
Or some shit.

72
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,880
It's weird.

73
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,560
I... So... I bought an exercise bike, too.

74
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,660
I have to, like... It's still outside.

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,860
They delivered it this morning.

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,200
It's still outside my door.

77
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,760
Along with the doggy gate.

78
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,060
That I still have yet to... Nice.

79
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,480
Along with the... Along with the giant doggy gate box.

80
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,240
That I also still have yet to, like...

81
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,080
Still have yet to bring inside.

82
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,760
It's been out there for, like, at least a week now.

83
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,280
I think, like, almost two weeks now.

84
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,900
But, like, it's still there.

85
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,040
Um...

86
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,160
Um...

87
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,700
But now the exercise bike is also out there, too.

88
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,940
I... I swear to God.

89
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,440
I'll... I'll bring one of them in.

90
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,900
Most likely the exercise bike.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,960
And have to piece it together.

92
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,760
It was like...

93
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,580
Do you wanna pay $90 to have someone assemble it for you?

94
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,960
And then I looked at the thing.

95
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,440
I was like...

96
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
Easily assembled.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
And I was like...

98
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I can do that.

99
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,860
But first I need to bring it inside.

100
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,400
I'll worry about that later.

101
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,220
I'll...

102
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,620
I was like...

103
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,560
I can do that.

104
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,480
I'm just gonna...

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,080
I'll bring that in another time.

106
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,420
Um...

107
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,380
It literally said 30 minutes to assemble.

108
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,220
I...

109
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,100
They're like...

110
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,740
It only takes 30 minutes to assemble.

111
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,520
And I was like...

112
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,060
You know what?

113
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,140
That sounds like something I can do.

114
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,000
Um...

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,280
But yes.

116
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,380
I also bought an exercise bike.

117
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,240
Cause I was like...

118
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,520
I should, you know, move more.

119
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,140
Be a little bit more healthier.

120
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,180
I don't wanna go downstairs.

121
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:39,880
Uh...

122
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,200
But...

123
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,580
I don't wanna...

124
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,820
I don't wanna go downstairs.

125
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,880
But...

126
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,600
I wanna exercise in the comfort of my own apartment.

127
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,720
So...

128
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,620
So...

129
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,060
So...

130
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,720
So I bought one.

131
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:51,940
Um...

132
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,600
You know what's crazy?

133
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,720
I also have a treadmill.

134
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,120
I haven't used that in a while.

135
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,080
But I was like...

136
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,600
You know what?

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,080
I like biking more than running.

138
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,860
So I was like...

139
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,080
Okay.

140
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,580
I'm definitely more motivated to bike than I am to run.

141
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,240
So like...

142
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,340
I feel like it'll be better.

143
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,700
I feel like...

144
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,320
I feel like...

145
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,740
Because I think I bike more than I run.

146
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:15,960
And...

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,180
You know what's crazy?

148
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,420
I used to have an exercise bike when I lived with my parents.

149
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,740
And then I got the treadmill.

150
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,600
Because I was like...

151
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,060
I'm gonna run more than I bike.

152
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,940
But now...

153
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,680
So then my parents got rid of the treadmill.

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,240
Oh no.

155
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,400
Got rid of the biking...

156
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,820
Bike one.

157
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,900
So like...

158
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,260
I don't know what happened to the bike one.

159
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,560
So now I'm like...

160
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:32,840
You know what?

161
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,480
I think I bike more than I run.

162
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,200
So I'm gonna...

163
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm gonna get that.

164
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,640
You're a mess.

165
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,380
I don't know.

166
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,900
Maybe as I got older...

167
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,560
I was like...

168
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:46,680
No.

169
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,620
I definitely like biking more than riding.

170
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:48,640
Right?

171
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,340
Meaning...

172
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,300
Yeah.

173
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,440
So...

174
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,560
Yes.

175
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,000
Anyway.

176
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:56,680
Sorry.

177
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,720
What was I talking about before I got into...

178
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,740
What was I talking about before I got...

179
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,680
I got distracted about my...

180
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,120
The exercise bike.

181
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,560
Oh yeah.

182
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,520
The Uber Eats story.

183
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,560
So...

184
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
Two laundry dry racks.

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,760
Thank you for this super chat.

186
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:14,960
Yeah.

187
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,680
Thank you.

188
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,280
Thank you.

189
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:16,860
Okay.

190
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,420
Sorry.

191
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,380
My original story.

192
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,640
About the...

193
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,540
I like how I'm dropping all of this...

194
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,080
On the Dynasty Warriors stream too.

195
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,320
So not a lot of people are gonna hear this story.

196
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,740
People are really missing out.

197
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,720
I drop all the...

198
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,060
I always drop the most interesting stories...

199
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,820
During the Dynasty Warriors streams.

200
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100
D-Dragon.

201
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,980
Thank you for the super chat.

202
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,560
Thank you.

203
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,280
Thank you.

204
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Uh...

205
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,280
Doki.

206
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,600
At this point, I think you...

207
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,280
Get out from us judging you...

208
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,260
On your life choices.

209
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,060
Black.

210
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you for the super chat.

211
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,320
Thank you.

212
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:51,760
Thank you.

213
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,940
As a mountain biker, biking is great.

214
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
Even when you're confronted with your own mortality.

215
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,820
After...

216
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,740
Jesus Christ.

217
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,700
That sounds fucking scary.

218
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,400
Um...

219
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,320
After you make a mistake.

220
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,180
Thank you for the super chat.

221
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,500
Thank you.

222
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,060
Thank you.

223
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:05,980
Um...

224
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,720
What was I gonna say?

225
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,060
Oh yeah.

226
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,680
Uh...

227
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,020
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

228
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,460
Okay.

229
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:09,900
So...

230
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,940
So I was like...

231
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,100
Okay.

232
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm gonna order from the sushi place.

233
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,180
Because...

234
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,800
Also like...

235
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,440
By the way...

236
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,640
Sorry.

237
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,400
Another off topic.

238
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,300
Um...

239
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,360
Because I noticed it's flickering.

240
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,220
My third monitor...

241
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,220
The monitor where you guys live in...

242
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
Where I look at chat...

243
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,100
Is dying apparently.

244
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,880
Um...

245
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,860
I did own this monitor for like...

246
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,820
Five plus years now.

247
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,140
So like...

248
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,780
Um...

249
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,340
So like...

250
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,460
It's like flickering...

251
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,380
On and up.

252
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,200
So I might have to like...

253
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,980
Use two monitors for now.

254
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,420
I might have to...

255
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,180
I might have to live my...

256
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,500
Oh!

257
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,880
I have to look at the left side.

258
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,980
It's so weird.

259
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm not used to looking at the...

260
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,620
The thing is...

261
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,360
My monitor is like flicking...

262
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,300
I do have another spare monitor.

263
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
But monitors are so fucking heavy though.

264
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:50,860
Oh!

265
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,340
It's so weird having like...

266
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,780
Two monitors.

267
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,720
Um...

268
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,420
Because like...

269
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:54,980
I like...

270
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,280
It's so weird looking at left side...

271
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,340
Instead of right side...

272
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,940
For my chat.

273
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,620
Um...

274
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,540
But yes.

275
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,440
It's flickering.

276
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,540
It's not the cable.

277
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,220
By the way.

278
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,220
It's...

279
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,420
I...

280
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,100
I...

281
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,500
Tested it.

282
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:05,780
I mean...

283
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,380
I could try the HDMI cable.

284
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,180
Let me try that real quick guys.

285
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,980
I'm just gonna push it in a little bit.

286
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,820
See if it's the...

287
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,220
HDMI cable.

288
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,680
Ugh!

289
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,130
Okay.

290
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,110
Okay.

291
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,830
It's like all pushed really in.

292
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,050
I might have to hire a handyman to fix this.

293
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,890
I...

294
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,590
Okay.

295
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,650
So...

296
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,170
My third monitor...

297
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,470
The weird thing is...

298
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,790
Is that...

299
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,490
Um...

300
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,350
The really weird thing is that...

301
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,870
Uh...

302
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,830
When I restart my PC...

303
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,530
And...

304
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,350
Uh...

305
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,370
When I...

306
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,630
When I have to restart my PC...

307
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:55,930
Or...

308
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,570
When I turn my monitor on and off...

309
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,050
It's okay.

310
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,710
So I don't think it's a cable issue.

311
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:00,750
Because it's okay.

312
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,910
Until like...

313
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,370
Uh...

314
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,150
Like a couple of minutes.

315
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,290
Like maybe 10 to 15 minutes.

316
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,370
And it starts flickering again.

317
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,790
So I assume...

318
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,310
It's like...

319
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,370
I assume that it's just my monitor is dying.

320
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,710
It's at the end of its lifespan.

321
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,310
Right now.

322
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,070
So...

323
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:13,750
Um...

324
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,070
So I think that's...

325
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,750
Why...

326
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,070
That's...

327
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,590
So I...

328
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:16,870
Like...

329
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,430
And then like...

330
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,650
I do have a spare monitor.

331
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,750
But like...

332
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,350
It's so heavy.

333
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,010
It's so fucking heavy.

334
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,170
So I'm like...

335
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:27,810
Um...

336
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,090
Yeah.

337
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,390
So I'm just like...

338
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:29,750
Oh...

339
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,570
I don't wanna...

340
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,490
I don't wanna...

341
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,490
You know...

342
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,170
Plug the monitor.

343
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,290
And like...

344
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,550
Plug in the new monitor.

345
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,890
So I might...

346
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,910
I have to...

347
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,870
Oh my god.

348
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,910
It's so heavy for me.

349
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:44,730
Uh...

350
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,210
Um...

351
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,750
So yeah.

352
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,370
I don't know.

353
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:49,770
Anyway.

354
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,430
Sorry.

355
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,490
The Uber Eats order.

356
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,870
Back to the Uber Eats story.

357
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,790
So...

358
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,590
Um...

359
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,710
I ordered my thing.

360
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,950
And I was so excited for it.

361
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,210
And then when I arrived...

362
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,010
I was like...

363
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,270
Why is it two boxes?

364
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,670
And then when I opened the first...

365
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,170
And I was like...

366
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,190
Why did you give me Coke?

367
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,590
Because I ordered a...

368
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,930
Japanese drink.

369
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,610
And then I got Coke.

370
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,070
So I was like...

371
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,250
Why did I get...

372
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,650
Why did I get Coke?

373
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,070
And why is there two boxes?

374
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,450
So I opened the two boxes up.

375
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,590
It's clearly...

376
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,850
Not a bento box.

377
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,210
Because it was like...

378
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,230
One of them was like...

379
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,750
Like...

380
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,110
Sushi.

381
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,610
But...

382
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,690
And it was like...

383
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,070
You know...

384
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,510
Sushi order.

385
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,950
The other one was also sushi order.

386
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,130
But I was like...

387
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,410
Wait.

388
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,730
Wait, but my bento box should have sashimi and all that shit on it and sushi, too.

389
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,630
And then so I was like, and this was obviously cheaper than what the fuck I ordered because I ordered sashimi in it.

390
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,110
So I was like, okay, what the fuck is going on?

391
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,030
And I looked at the box.

392
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,050
So, okay, so let me tell you, the name on the order...

393
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,970
So I'm DokiBird, right?

394
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:04,030
So, like, just imagine, okay, the name of the order is, like, DokiBird, but it was, like...

395
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:13,630
Just think that, instead of it being DokiBird, it's, like, DokiBirdy.

396
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,410
Or DokiBread, or some shit.

397
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,330
So I was like, what the...

398
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,030
It's like, yeah, DokiPird.

399
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,110
Just think, like, it's just, like, DokiPird.

400
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,270
Because I was like, wait a minute.

401
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,030
Not only is my first name spelled wrong, but my...

402
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,370
That's not even my last name's initial.

403
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:35,930
Like...

404
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,590
So...

405
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,790
Someone else had a similar name as mine, but it was spelled wrong?

406
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,010
And it's also, like, not my initial for my last name.

407
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,890
So I...

408
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,690
So I was like, how the fuck did I get...

409
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,270
I got somebody else's order.

410
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,310
I literally got somebody else's order.

411
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,190
I was...

412
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,850
But it was, like, the names were...

413
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,450
It's, like, the parallel universe of my name.

414
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,090
And...

415
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,670
I was so upset, because I was like,

416
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,790
clearly more expensive.

417
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,930
They got the better meal!

418
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,190
Like...

419
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,230
They got...

420
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,370
They actually got the better meal.

421
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,190
My...

422
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,530
My bento box had fucking lobster!

423
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,130
I had lobster in my order!

424
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,030
And sashimi!

425
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,170
I had a lobster roll!

426
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,450
No, I...

427
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,170
I...

428
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,770
I reported it.

429
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,570
And they're like, oh yeah, they processed a refund.

430
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,130
They already processed a refund.

431
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,150
It should show up.

432
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:53,790
Um...

433
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,590
It should show...

434
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,710
It should show up in, like, a couple of days.

435
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,190
But, like, I didn't know...

436
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,170
The guy was gone!

437
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,150
But I, like...

438
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,810
Obviously, I had, like, stuff to do.

439
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,070
So I was like...

440
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,670
I'm gonna finish my stuff real quick.

441
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,310
And then, like, I'm gonna...

442
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,010
Oh my god, it's flickering again.

443
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,550
Oh, it's flickering again.

444
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,310
Yeah, I'm gonna look at...

445
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,590
I'm gonna turn this monitor off.

446
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,170
I cannot deal with the flickering.

447
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:14,750
Right?

448
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:15,730
Um...

449
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,910
Cause I have, like...

450
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,110
Cause, like, you know, seizure warning and shit like that.

451
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,830
Uh...

452
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,750
So I can't...

453
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,730
I'm, like, worried about shit like that.

454
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,090
Um...

455
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,470
Um...

456
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,910
But I...

457
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,190
I couldn't believe it!

458
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:28,970
I was like...

459
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,330
They can't fuck it up a fourth time.

460
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,110
There's no way...

461
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,630
How bad could my luck be...

462
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,190
That they would fuck it up a fourth time?

463
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:38,930
Hehehehe...

464
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,730
I...

465
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,530
I couldn't believe it!

466
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,730
Um...

467
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,530
Roy...

468
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,030
Thank you for the super chat thing.

469
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,970
Thank you.

470
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,550
Um...

471
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,150
I'll top it.

472
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,750
What do you think about...

473
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,970
Ultron in Marvel Rivals?

474
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,490
If you saw the release of the trailer?

475
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,150
Oh!

476
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,710
He seems really strong!

477
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,590
I was told that he's most likely gonna be, like, the third support.

478
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,570
So, like, most DPS players are gonna be playing him.

479
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,650
Or, like, in competitive-wise.

480
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,450
Cause he's...

481
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,530
He'll be, like, the Atom.

482
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,810
Where you run a third...

483
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,350
Third support.

484
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,570
Like, the old...

485
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,450
Or the old Jeff.

486
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,190
Cause they re...

487
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,070
They nerfed him.

488
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,370
Like, they, like, reworked Jeff to be more of a healer.

489
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,530
So Ultron might be, like, the new Jeff.

490
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,550
Um...

491
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,550
Maddie, thank you for the super chat.

492
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:16,870
Thank you.

493
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,390
Thank you.

494
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,230
You should get a new MSI monitor.

495
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:19,830
That's the thing.

496
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,850
I have one of the MSI monitors there.

497
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,530
But it's...

498
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,930
It's just, like, my arms are so noodley when it comes to, like, carrying things.

499
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,630
So...

500
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,190
By the way.

501
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,210
Um...

502
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,670
I am done rage baiting people by, uh...

503
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,090
Playing mouse and keyboard on...

504
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,650
For Elden Ring.

505
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,670
Because after that, my wrists got tired.

506
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,950
My wrists were sore after that.

507
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,270
So I'm gonna...

508
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,230
I'm gonna play on controller.

509
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,190
Um...

510
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,370
I can't...

511
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:47,890
My...

512
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,110
I can't believe it.

513
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,370
I am able to play 12 plus hours of Marvel Rivals M&K.

514
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,830
But, like, my...

515
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,070
My...

516
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,670
My wrists actually got tired in Elden Ring.

517
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,330
It was like...

518
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,190
It got...

519
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,010
Actually got sore.

520
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:02,990
So...

521
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,050
I was like...

522
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,310
Okay.

523
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,250
Um...

524
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,870
I'm gonna play controller on the second part.

525
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:08,530
I...

526
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,250
I can't...

527
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,690
I can't deal with that.

528
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,650
Uh...

529
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,610
That's...

530
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,150
I rage baited my wrists.

531
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:17,730
Yeah.

532
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,290
Um...

533
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,310
I wanted a rage bait, but...

534
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,830
I ended up fucking myself over.

535
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,590
That's crazy.

536
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:27,970
Uh...

537
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,510
Papa Smurf.

538
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,930
Thank you for the super chat.

539
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,330
Thank you.

540
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,870
Thank you.

541
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,750
This dope won't burn me for fourth time.

542
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,950
Doki probably.

543
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,130
Um...

544
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:36,510
So yeah.

545
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,330
Oh...

546
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,830
That's...

547
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,070
So that's what happened.

548
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,010
Um...

549
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,990
I just can't believe I got fucked over fourth time.

550
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,790
Also...

551
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,430
Another...

552
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,190
I'll give you guys a dad update.

553
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,070
Um...

554
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,550
So...

555
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,290
Dad update.

556
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,390
Um...

557
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,770
So...

558
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,810
I've been taking him to the dog park instead of like walking him the usual road.

559
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,770
Because like I said, he hates harnesses.

560
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:57,850
And...

561
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,550
Um...

562
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,690
Dad hates harnesses.

563
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,210
Doki Amber Doge hates harnesses.

564
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,090
And also...

565
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,930
They somehow got rid of all the trash cans.

566
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,410
On my walk.

567
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,570
I don't know why.

568
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,290
Like...

569
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,770
Ever since like he broke his back.

570
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,370
You know, obviously I haven't been walking him.

571
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,270
But during the span of him breaking his back.

572
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,610
And...

573
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,170
Um...

574
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,510
Going...

575
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,890
You know, staying at the pet sitter.

576
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,470
The trash cans disappear.

577
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,030
So...

578
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,030
So I was like...

579
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,750
I'm never...

580
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,050
I'm not gonna take him...

581
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,490
Off there anymore.

582
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,390
So...

583
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,890
And then like...

584
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,290
I'm not...

585
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,910
I don't wanna bring the trash...

586
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,930
His poops...

587
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,890
Back to my place.

588
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,710
And then throw it in my own garbage.

589
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,950
Like I feel like...

590
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,910
I don't know...

591
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,710
I just think that's fucking weird.

592
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,110
So, somehow, all the trashcans disappear.

593
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,670
The closest trashcan, like, is outside, is, like, a lot further away.

594
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,690
So, I was just like, I'm not walking that far.

595
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,790
Like, because I have to walk him three times a day.

596
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,930
And I was like, okay, yeah, I'm not doing that.

597
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,750
So, I had to take him to, like, my dog park area.

598
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:05,750
But, like, it's, like, near my... it's, like, sort of, like, near my apartment building.

599
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,350
So, I, like, I don't have to actually go outside.

600
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,690
Like, my apartment, like, leads to the dog park.

601
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,690
But it's, like, it's, like, a miniaturized thing.

602
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,490
It's not, like, a big dog park or anything.

603
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,670
It's, like, a miniaturized thing.

604
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,870
And, um...

605
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:24,750
And so, like, so, when I walk there, because I can walk inside my apartment to get to the dog park, um...

606
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,390
It's, like, yeah, it feels less hygienic.

607
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,010
I don't know.

608
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,530
It's, like, I mean, you need to clean it.

609
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,670
But, like, obviously, it smells not great.

610
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:55,610
I would say that, like, the dog park doesn't smell the greatest, but, um, anyway, um, when we, like, walked there, um, okay, so there was, it's not indoors, it's outside, but it's, like, artificial grass and stuff, so, um, so, okay, when we walked there,

611
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:07,490
because we have to, like, we have, there's a pathway from the apartment complex to there, um, and, um, I think it's artificial grass, I'm not totally sure, but the grass does not look real.

612
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:14,750
I, I don't want to touch it, because all the dogs have been, like, pooping and peeing on it, so, I'm not gonna, I, I'm not gonna touch it.

613
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,830
Like, to, like, make sure it's real grass.

614
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:26,070
Like, so, I assume it's, I assume it's artificial, because it looks artificial to me.

615
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:41,510
Anyway, um, so, like, we passed, I, when I was walking him there, it was, like, some pugs walking, like, on the opposite side, directly towards me, and then, dad, like, looked at them, and then he looked at me, and he's, like, pick me up.

616
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,130
So, dad was, like, okay, okay, because he was, like, walking, he was, like, pick me up, and I was, like, okay.

617
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:52,150
I was bent down, he instantly, like, got in my arms, and in a moment, I picked him up, he just starts barking at the pugs.

618
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:58,680
I... I was like, what the fuck?

619
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,600
He's just like, that's right.

620
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,800
Get, move!

621
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,440
Get outta here!

622
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,780
He's like, yeah, he's like, I need to have the high ground if I'm gonna challenge him.

623
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,080
I was like, I was like, you pussy-ass bitch.

624
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:22,020
Like, you needed me to pick you up before you fucking bark at them.

625
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,360
I have the high ground.

626
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,340
I was like, that's right, bitch.

627
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,740
Move!

628
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,680
And then another thing that happened was that this was yesterday.

629
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,080
This was yesterday.

630
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,760
When I went to the dog park, there was a pretty lady there.

631
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,380
And dad was so excited.

632
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,460
But the pretty lady had, like, her own small dog.

633
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,280
And then also a big dog with her that's walking around.

634
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,880
So she had, like, this small dog with her in her arms.

635
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,640
And dad walked over there and he was like, yes, pay attention to me!

636
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,600
And he's like, yes!

637
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,600
And he's, like, clawing her leg and everything.

638
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,900
And obviously the small dog got really jealous.

639
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,900
And was trying to, like, bark at him.

640
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,960
And he's like, get out of here!

641
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,420
This is my owner!

642
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,280
And the other big dog also got really mad, too.

643
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,640
And he was, like, trying to, like, push her in my way.

644
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,140
He was like, yeah!

645
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,600
This is our owner!

646
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,100
And he ignored them.

647
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,360
And was like, yes!

648
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,160
Pay attention to me!

649
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,600
Yes!

650
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,500
And then the owner was like, is he always like this?

651
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,140
And I was like, um, not...

652
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,900
I didn't want to say only to women.

653
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,940
But, like, I was like, not really.

654
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,720
Because I was like...

655
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,680
And then, like, I would push him away.

656
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,280
And I would, like, take him to, like, the other side of the field.

657
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,560
And then he would, like, um...

658
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,020
He would, like, run back to her.

659
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,580
It was crazy.

660
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,900
He kept running back to her every time.

661
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,900
And, like, and then, like, he was like, no.

662
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,500
And then he was like...

663
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,400
And then she...

664
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,060
The owner thought that he was just interested in the smaller dog.

665
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,440
So she was like, oh, you want to play with the smaller dog, right?

666
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,220
So she put down the smaller dog.

667
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,800
And then he didn't give a fuck.

668
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,000
He didn't give a fuck about the other dog.

669
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,960
He was like, yes, now that that dog's out of the way.

670
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,520
Pick me up!

671
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,620
Pick me up!

672
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,420
And...

673
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,080
And then, so, so, obviously, like, he was like, oh, you're not interested.

674
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,200
Okay, I'm just gonna hold my other small dog back.

675
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:57,360
And he just kept, like, like, looking at her and kept clawing her, pawing her and stuff, pawing on her legs and everything, just trying to, like, get his attention.

676
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,160
So now it's like, okay, you're clearly not gonna poop, right?

677
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,040
So, I was trying to get him to poop, but he clearly was not gonna poop.

678
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,820
So I had to pick him up.

679
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,760
And I was like, alright, it's over.

680
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,680
We're going home.

681
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,580
And then I, like, went out.

682
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,220
And obviously he isn't leashed or harnessed because, like, he doesn't like harnesses and stuff.

683
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,840
I don't wanna, like, force him.

684
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,940
And I'm not allowed to use the, uh, to use, like, a leash on his neck.

685
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,640
So then he just follows me around.

686
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,440
But then, like, because of that lady, I was like, you know, I was like, come on, let's go.

687
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,720
And then he, like, walks back to the door and just looks out the door, trying to find her.

688
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,860
And he refuses to move.

689
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,520
I was like, Doki, Doki, come on.

690
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,100
Come on, Doki, come on.

691
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,600
And he just, like, stands there just looking outside.

692
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
Because it's a seafood door.

693
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,440
He's just, like, looking outside.

694
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,500
And he's like, where is she?

695
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
And then I picked him up.

696
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,680
I picked him up.

697
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,040
I walked all the way to the... I walked all the way... down the hallway.

698
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,280
And then... I walked down the hallway to, like, try to get away from that dog park door.

699
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,840
And then, like... And then he runs back to the door.

700
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,600
Like, I put him down because I had to get my keys and stuff to, like, access my apartment complex.

701
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,360
And I put him down, and then he runs back to the door.

702
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,040
And I was just like, what the fuck?

703
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,720
He knows what he wants.

704
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,160
I don't know why.

705
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,380
He was so obsessed with her.

706
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,680
He's never done that before.

707
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,400
He would, you know, every time, like, you know, I let him...

708
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,020
Like, I was like, alright, it's time to go home.

709
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,140
He would walk, he would, like, just lead himself to back home.

710
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,180
And then he just runs back to the door, and he's like, where is she?

711
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,580
Where is she?

712
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,000
That's the love of my life right there.

713
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:08,520
So I had to walk back, pick him up again, and then just, like, had him in my arms while I walk home.

714
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,860
Like, because he wouldn't...

715
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,960
Every time, like, I try to be like, okay, I'll put you down.

716
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,640
And then he'll, like, turn around and start going back.

717
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,960
And I was just like, okay, you're not allowed to touch the ground anymore.

718
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,100
You're not allowed until we're home.

719
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:21,920
I...

720
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,060
Maybe I'll see her again.

721
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,940
So, so I don't trust him.

722
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,340
I don't trust him anymore.

723
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,780
I mean, and then, like, after that, the next walk, he was fine.

724
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,020
He was totally fine.

725
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,380
And then the day after that, he was totally fine.

726
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,760
Yeah, no, he's fucking neutered.

727
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,640
Of course he's neutered.

728
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,500
Like, I...

729
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,940
So, yeah, and then, and then he was, and then he's, like, fine on the next walk.

730
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,380
And the walk after that, I was like, what the fuck?

731
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,840
Like, what's wrong with you?

732
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,080
Like, like...

733
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,020
I had to follow your heart.

734
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,900
No, she's gone forever.

735
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,120
I hope I never see her again.

736
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:09,900
I...

737
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,400
That's right.

738
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,700
I said it.

739
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
Also, I need to be left side doki.

740
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,080
I almost forgot.

741
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,560
All right.

742
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,180
Left side doki.

743
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,560
Get out right side doki.

744
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,640
It's time.

745
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,660
Was I left side doki last time I streamed?

746
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,220
I don't know.

747
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,980
I've been so all over the place.

748
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,700
Let me double check.

749
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,540
I'm actually curious.

750
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,360
Was I on left side the last time I streamed Dynasty Warriors?

751
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,440
Because I feel like I was.

752
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:33,760
Oh, no.

753
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,240
I was.

754
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,600
All right.

755
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,400
All right.

756
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,520
I was on left side.

757
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,220
Yes.

758
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:37,940
Left side.

759
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,160
Maybe the last time you'll ever see left side doki.

760
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,200
It's so weird, guys.

761
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,260
It's so weird having my chat on the left monitor.

762
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,600
Because I'm not used to looking on the left side for chat.

763
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,840
Oh, I don't know if I like it.

764
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,020
I don't know.

765
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,780
I don't know if I like this.

766
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,460
All right.

767
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,180
Momo, thank you for the super chat.

768
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,480
Thank you.

769
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,060
Thank you.

770
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,620
I got the higher ground now.

771
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,660
I'm superior.

772
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,460
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

773
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:06,780
Thank you.

774
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,440
Thank you.

775
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,960
Speaking of Eldering, as someone who was a Vodgoon for it, I really enjoyed your playthrough no matter how dumb it got.

776
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,300
Missing your souls playthrough and looking forward to part two.

777
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,340
Thank you for the super chat.

778
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:16,740
Thank you.

779
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,260
Thank you.

780
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,220
I'm glad you guys have been enjoying Eldering.

781
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,380
You know my manager?

782
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,160
He was like, thank God.

783
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,740
Stream more of those games.

784
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,800
He's like, I'm glad you're finally finishing Dynasty Warriors.

785
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,180
Stream more of those, stream more of those other games.

786
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,940
Alright, alright, it's time to see it.

787
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,980
He's like, I'm so fucking happy you're finally finishing Dynasty Warriors.

788
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,100
Jesus Christ.

789
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:03,580
Alright, by the way, I didn't realize I've been streaming Dynasty Warriors for like four months now.

790
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,840
And now I understand.

791
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,440
I understand now.

792
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,220
I didn't even realize it's been four months since I started.

793
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,060
That's actually crazy.

794
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,980
I didn't know I've been streaming this for so long.

795
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
That's insane.

796
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,420
Alright, hope you're grounded.

797
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,060
Flint and Steel off stream to start the fire at TV.

798
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,120
Thank you for the super chat.

799
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,080
Thank you.

800
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,880
Thank you.

801
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,400
Manny, I'm sad.

802
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:32,880
Left side.

803
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,880
Toki is graduating.

804
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,880
Wishing her a good future.

805
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,280
Thank you for the super chat.

806
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:37,760
Thank you.

807
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,580
Thank you.

808
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,520
Oh my God.

809
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,540
Alright.

810
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,560
I can't believe it too.

811
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,500
I was surprised.

812
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,120
I was like, oh my God.

813
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,760
Has it really been that long?

814
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,020
Alright, let's see.

815
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,740
Okay, I need...

816
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,860
Okay, so I actually got a tier list out.

817
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,140
Okay, I need... Bursting Waste Slash.

818
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,460
A... Azer Dragon Bellow.

819
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,180
And Great Mountain Throw.

820
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,020
What the fuck are all those?

821
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,540
Okay.

822
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:06,560
Okay.

823
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,500
Bursting Waste Slash.

824
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,480
Dragon.

825
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,620
Okay, Azer.

826
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,040
Dragon Bellow.

827
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,660
And look, we...

828
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,680
We need as much anything.

829
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:14,960
We...

830
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,540
We're fucking min-maxing, guys.

831
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,200
I'm done.

832
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,780
I'm so done.

833
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,540
Do you have the Great Mountain?

834
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,440
What the fuck is the Great Mountain?

835
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,000
Guys, I...

836
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,460
I cannot.

837
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,920
You guys saw how fucked up that was.

838
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,580
That level was so fucked up.

839
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,700
Okay, I don't have Great Mountain.

840
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,540
Whatever.

841
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,280
Okay, and then...

842
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,400
Whoops.

843
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,040
Get back on my horse.

844
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,420
Okay.

845
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,720
And then...

846
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,000
We need to have actual items now.

847
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,840
Okay, I have Strength Potion.

848
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,660
Guys, look at that.

849
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,800
I bought items.

850
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,680
I...

851
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,540
Guys, look at that.

852
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,020
I bought items.

853
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,380
That's how desperate I was in fucking beating this fight.

854
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,220
Look at that.

855
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm literally...

856
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,980
I am literally six levels ahead.

857
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,780
There's no way.

858
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,200
There's no fucking way.

859
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,260
There's no fucking way.

860
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,940
I'm...

861
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,640
I...

862
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,680
Oh my God.

863
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,100
I fought sick...

864
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,680
I leveled up so much.

865
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,560
No, you don't understand.

866
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,940
This...

867
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,660
This...

868
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,680
I'm going alone.

869
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,740
Because like...

870
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,960
You don't understand.

871
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,060
This battle is so brutal.

872
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,880
Everyone around me kept fucking dying.

873
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,340
I don't know what to do.

874
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,100
I...

875
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,640
I don't know what to do.

876
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,020
I...

877
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,080
I don't know what to do.

878
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,300
I...

879
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,360
I...

880
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,560
They were all dying.

881
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,700
Like...

882
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,120
I don't know what to do.

883
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,780
Alright, you have to tell me when the wind changes, guys.

884
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
I cannot think for myself right now.

885
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,740
I...

886
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,660
For the sake of our inalienable ambitions.

887
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,520
I...

888
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh my God.

889
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,740
I already almost fucked it up.

890
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,140
We must take command of this battle.

891
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,260
I cannot think for myself.

892
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,980
Like, I need you guys to think for me when the wind changes.

893
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,280
No, you guys have to...

894
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,960
Or we're gonna ha...

895
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,020
Or we're gonna be playing Dynasty Warriors until the end of time.

896
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,380
I cannot.

897
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,100
I cannot.

898
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,240
Like...

899
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,120
Every...

900
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,840
Every stream will just be the battle of Chibi.

901
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,320
I swear to God.

902
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,420
I...

903
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,020
I...

904
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,140
I...

905
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,340
This...

906
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,020
This stream will never end.

907
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,700
Repel the hostile offensive.

908
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,100
Okay.

909
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,500
Alright.

910
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,400
I'm okay.

911
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,840
Our chance of victory remains.

912
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,440
Yippee!

913
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,480
You're right.

914
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,180
I should've asked this in the community.

915
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,540
I should've asked that in a...

916
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,860
In a different stream.

917
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,520
Because I forgot.

918
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,940
All you hear that stuck through the entire Dynasty Warriors playthrough.

919
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,180
You won it.

920
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,360
I forgot.

921
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,620
You guys all won that.

922
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,540
I...

923
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,560
Alright.

924
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,380
How do I...

925
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,680
Guys, I don't remember how to...

926
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,700
Okay, this is bad.

927
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,620
How do I lock in?

928
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,200
I don't remember, guys.

929
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,100
Oh, it's been too long.

930
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,020
I actually don't remember.

931
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,760
Oh wait, it's this.

932
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,020
Okay.

933
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,300
Okay, nice.

934
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:00,880
Oh my god.

935
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,300
We're good.

936
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,060
We're good to go.

937
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,260
Take that.

938
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,340
Okay.

939
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,640
One down.

940
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,560
One down.

941
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,700
Has been defeated.

942
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
With all my might.

943
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:11,840
Boom!

944
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,660
I missed it somehow.

945
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,320
But that's okay.

946
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,220
Concentrate.

947
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,660
Because I have this move too.

948
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:18,900
Okay.

949
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,320
If I could test my skills.

950
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:20,900
There you go.

951
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Oh my god.

952
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,940
This is actually...

953
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,260
We're actually improving.

954
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:24,860
Has been defeated.

955
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,060
That is actually so good.

956
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,380
Oh my god.

957
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,760
Take that.

958
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,980
Thank god.

959
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,080
Oh my god.

960
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:31,480
Thank god.

961
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:31,840
Okay.

962
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,960
I just have to leave.

963
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:33,380
Sorry.

964
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm gonna leave now.

965
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,780
I'm gonna leave.

966
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,740
You guys can deal with it.

967
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,580
I have to go to the other side.

968
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,280
Jesus Christ.

969
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,620
Okay.

970
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:44,740
Oh my god.

971
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,760
I've lost track of how to get to the others.

972
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,800
Oh my god.

973
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,560
It's...

974
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,700
I'm doing great.

975
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,160
But I'm also like...

976
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,260
Not okay.

977
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,780
I'm hitting everything.

978
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,460
Alright.

979
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,180
Oh.

980
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,020
Thank you for the super chat.

981
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,360
Thank you.

982
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:56,820
Thank you.

983
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,380
Okay.

984
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,100
I have to head to the other side now.

985
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,420
Jesus Christ.

986
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:00,840
Okay.

987
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,260
We're heading to the other side.

988
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,660
Goodbye.

989
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,620
My people need me.

990
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,660
Everybody here is so fucking weak.

991
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,180
So far.

992
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,660
I'd say it's just about time to land another blood.

993
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,040
I'm running as fast as I can.

994
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:11,600
No!

995
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,020
Oh no.

996
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:13,860
Oh no.

997
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,740
The other people are here too.

998
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,120
Damn.

999
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,920
When did they get behind us?

1000
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,020
I don't know.

1001
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,640
But I have to...

1002
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,460
This just became a lot more complicated.

1003
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,520
I'm fucking right.

1004
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,500
Oh my god.

1005
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,060
How are you already fucking dead?

1006
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:25,760
How?

1007
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,760
How are you dead?

1008
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,420
How are you dead?

1009
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,540
How...

1010
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,040
Deal with the ambush first.

1011
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,760
It's too late.

1012
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,700
It's too late.

1013
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,880
I'm already on the other side.

1014
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,320
It's too fucking late.

1015
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,740
I made it to the other side.

1016
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,300
My strength was not enough.

1017
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,660
We must maintain a constant...

1018
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,040
It's already too late.

1019
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,980
I'm already here.

1020
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,780
Keep the enemy reinforcements at bay.

1021
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,140
To protect our archers.

1022
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:48,760
Please.

1023
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,400
Duel me.

1024
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,440
Oh my god.

1025
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,580
I need every duel I could get.

1026
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,120
Here you go.

1027
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:55,920
Okay.

1028
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:57,960
That's fine.

1029
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,040
Time to act.

1030
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,880
That's fine.

1031
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,700
Luckily I just got that.

1032
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,300
Check that.

1033
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,080
Whirl.

1034
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,300
Yes.

1035
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,200
Let's go.

1036
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,020
Easy.

1037
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:09,960
That's right.

1038
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,340
My.

1039
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:11,880
Easy.

1040
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,000
Please.

1041
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,520
I need all of you guys to...

1042
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:15,920
Oh my god.

1043
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,720
Are you serious?

1044
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,080
Oh, that was a crit dodge.

1045
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,240
I was like...

1046
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,260
What?

1047
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,220
That didn't register.

1048
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,900
I should have registered.

1049
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:24,940
Easy.

1050
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,300
Okay.

1051
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,920
Easy.

1052
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,500
Nice.

1053
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm locked in guys.

1054
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,200
I'm so locked in.

1055
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,960
I'm so locked in.

1056
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,300
Yeah.

1057
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,100
Get out of here.

1058
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,220
You may not be able to make it through this.

1059
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,320
No.

1060
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,120
Don't say that.

1061
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,720
I'm doing everything I can.

1062
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,260
Okay.

1063
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,300
I'm gonna kill one more guy.

1064
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,680
Maybe next time.

1065
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,180
I'm gonna kill one more.

1066
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,460
It's time.

1067
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,960
Before I go to the other side again.

1068
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:55,320
It's time.

1069
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,120
I'm...

1070
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,660
heading...

1071
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,260
for the altar.

1072
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,860
Oh my god.

1073
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,400
Please.

1074
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,700
Alright.

1075
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,120
I'm done.

1076
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,080
Alright.

1077
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,460
Goodbye.

1078
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,240
No.

1079
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,340
Goodbye.

1080
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,440
I gotta go to the other side.

1081
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,060
Goodbye.

1082
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,180
I gotta go to the other side.

1083
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:15,820
Alright.

1084
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,800
Time to go to the other side now.

1085
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,520
Alright.

1086
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,260
Nice.

1087
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,160
Alright.

1088
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,040
Other side.

1089
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:24,980
My people need me.

1090
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,340
My other people need me now.

1091
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:27,660
Please.

1092
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,240
Live.

1093
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,360
Live.

1094
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,380
I'm coming.

1095
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:30,940
Jumping over!

1096
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,560
No!

1097
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,920
No!

1098
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,820
Live!

1099
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:36,860
Please!

1100
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,780
Please, I'm almost there!

1101
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,580
Eat as much bread as you can!

1102
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,720
Please!

1103
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,020
Even my horse is so leveled up!

1104
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,920
Oh my god, I swear to god.

1105
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,820
I swear to fucking god!

1106
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,260
Jesus!

1107
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,320
Okay, I'm here.

1108
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,620
I'm here.

1109
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,260
There we go.

1110
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,520
We will now begin the prayer.

1111
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,080
Jesus Christ.

1112
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,800
We must distract the enemy while carrying out the most vital part of the plan.

1113
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,200
Fire!

1114
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:05,720
Bring them down.

1115
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,160
I know this will be hard, but... I am counting on you all.

1116
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,740
Losing Lord Chugo Liang means losing this battle.

1117
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,660
We will not lose this!

1118
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,420
I'm doing everything I can!

1119
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:20,960
Please!

1120
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,140
Jesus Christ, I don't know how I actually... Are you fucking kidding me?!

1121
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,940
Are you fucking... Oh my god.

1122
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,620
That's it!

1123
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,740
That's it!

1124
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,060
I'm using strength now!

1125
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,660
That's it!

1126
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,040
I'm so strong now!

1127
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,500
You have to endure their assault for now.

1128
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,420
I think that's strength, right?

1129
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:49,980
Yeah, that is.

1130
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,460
Oh my god, please!

1131
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Oh my god, please!

1132
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,220
I killed so many!

1133
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:01,700
Please!

1134
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,680
The battle is more intense than I anticipated.

1135
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,900
Oh my god, let's get serious.

1136
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,400
And I will continue to fight without complaint.

1137
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,330
Okay.

1138
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,470
We've lost our archers in the east.

1139
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,630
You've lost your archers?!

1140
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:13,770
How?!

1141
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,330
The enemy's offensive will go on unimpeded now.

1142
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,510
Oh no.

1143
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,530
Oh no, I'm trying to kill him first!

1144
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,490
I need to kill him!

1145
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,530
That's it!

1146
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,310
Things don't look too good!

1147
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,150
Okay.

1148
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,570
That should kill him!

1149
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,370
That should kill him!

1150
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,530
Come on!

1151
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,270
I will use this too!

1152
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,050
That should kill both of them!

1153
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,890
Oh my god, okay, they're down!

1154
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,170
Alright!

1155
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,390
Alright, we got that down!

1156
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:52,750
Okay!

1157
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,090
Alright, we go back!

1158
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,810
We have to go to the other side!

1159
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:56,690
Okay, Sun Qian!

1160
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:57,370
Okay!

1161
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,190
These guys are like, fairly anything.

1162
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,550
I don't understand how you can die to this.

1163
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,370
Alright, I'm going to the other side!

1164
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:05,730
Goodbye!

1165
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,890
The enemy officer has been defeated!

1166
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,030
Annihilate the enemy with our fleet!

1167
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,470
Wait, actually, I'll kill him first too!

1168
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,850
Alright, goodbye!

1169
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,230
I leave!

1170
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,290
I leave!

1171
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:21,870
I leave!

1172
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:21,970
Goodbye!

1173
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,170
I have to go to the other side!

1174
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,070
I leave!

1175
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,050
Oh no!

1176
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:27,530
Goodbye!

1177
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,110
My other people need me too!

1178
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,890
That's stupid!

1179
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,150
Ah, Sky!

1180
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,850
I can't!

1181
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,770
I can't!

1182
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,750
I can't!

1183
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,350
I believe on my team!

1184
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,550
I believe my team!

1185
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,030
I believe in my team!

1186
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,330
I believe in them!

1187
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,390
I have to do this first!

1188
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,130
I lack the foresight to predict his betrayal!

1189
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,570
Okay!

1190
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,530
Okay!

1191
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,310
And stop him here!

1192
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,150
Alright!

1193
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,050
Okay, run!

1194
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,170
Come!

1195
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,210
Come!

1196
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:58,810
Show you!

1197
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,250
Of this point, there's nothing left to say!

1198
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:02,910
Okay!

1199
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,390
We got him!

1200
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,530
Go, Drakos!

1201
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,990
Go, Drakos!

1202
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,650
Okay, nice!

1203
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,690
Jesus Christ!

1204
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,250
Please!

1205
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,970
We should send the rear guard to bolster our defenses there!

1206
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,630
Oh my god!

1207
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:21,850
This!

1208
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,330
She said we can't lose!

1209
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,870
How did you die?!

1210
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,930
I was right there!

1211
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,870
I don't...

1212
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,490
Did you die?!

1213
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,470
We were all here together!

1214
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,070
The enemy has breached the altar room!

1215
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,150
What?!

1216
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,650
Oh shit!

1217
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,070
Alright, I'll be right back!

1218
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,150
Sorry, I gotta go!

1219
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,670
Oh shit!

1220
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,410
Oh shit!

1221
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,350
I gotta go!

1222
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,930
I'll be right back!

1223
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,270
I have to...

1224
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,890
I have to go to the altar room now!

1225
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,210
I'll be right back!

1226
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,570
I'll be right back, everyone!

1227
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,170
Please!

1228
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:03,710
Okay!

1229
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,690
Eat some bread!

1230
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,810
So I can go get to the altar room!

1231
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,290
Yeah!

1232
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,370
You've rushed in to aid me!

1233
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:11,770
Yes!

1234
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:12,490
You're fine!

1235
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,110
I swear!

1236
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,970
Please don't make me cry more!

1237
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,030
I swear to god!

1238
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:18,830
Dude!

1239
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,670
Have you sensed any changes in the wind?

1240
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,610
I don't know!

1241
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,490
Guys!

1242
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,410
Guys!

1243
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,790
Please tell me, has there been changes in the wind?

1244
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:28,330
Please!

1245
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,190
I don't know!

1246
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,910
I can't tell!

1247
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,950
I've been trying to figure this out!

1248
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:36,970
How?!

1249
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,770
Why is the wind?!

1250
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,730
Be warned!

1251
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,590
I shall not hold back!

1252
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,510
Oh my god!

1253
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:44,910
How did he get there?!

1254
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,250
How did he get there?!

1255
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,050
How did he get there?!

1256
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,530
Jesus!

1257
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:49,630
Please!

1258
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,290
Win!

1259
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:50,890
Change!

1260
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:53,950
Okay!

1261
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:55,930
Okay!

1262
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,690
How did this guy get here?!

1263
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,250
Okay!

1264
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,690
I know it, but he's desperate!

1265
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,170
I'm doing my best!

1266
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,070
I'm doing my best!

1267
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:08,450
James is holding a best!

1268
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:08,730
James is holding a best!

1269
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,130
But South-South forces still have the edge!

1270
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:12,750
Go be, please!

1271
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,190
Please, you have to live!

1272
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,630
You have to live!

1273
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,430
Wind, please, just change!

1274
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,490
Let's go!

1275
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:24,570
Let's get this!

1276
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,390
Wind, just change!

1277
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,530
Okay, I got him!

1278
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,330
Such great strength.

1279
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,850
Why won't the wind change?

1280
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,370
I don't understand!

1281
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,670
Please, change!

1282
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,070
Wind!

1283
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,850
Why won't you change?

1284
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,830
Oh my god, Lube!

1285
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:58,650
Just live!

1286
00:43:58,930 --> 00:43:59,430
Please, Lube!

1287
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,070
Please!

1288
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,410
Please, Lube!

1289
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,610
Oh no!

1290
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:07,970
Guys, I think it's over.

1291
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,470
I think it's over.

1292
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,870
I don't jump in!

1293
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,070
I'm doing my best!

1294
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:17,770
Guys!

1295
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,290
Guys, did the wind change?

1296
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,250
The wind still hasn't changed!

1297
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,910
The wind still hasn't changed!

1298
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,450
I don't understand!

1299
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:27,470
No!

1300
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,090
Why hasn't the wind changed?

1301
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:40,530
I don't understand!

1302
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,810
Okay.

1303
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:51,710
What if we let Guan Yun fight Xiaohu Dun, and then we go back home?

1304
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,370
Okay, I have an idea.

1305
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:55,710
Let's go.

1306
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,130
I go back now.

1307
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,410
Oh shit!

1308
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,450
I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going back.

1309
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:04,150
Okay.

1310
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:05,190
Okay.

1311
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:09,450
Guan Yun will deal with Xiaohu Dun, and then I go to Lube.

1312
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,010
I go to Lube.

1313
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:13,990
There's no way.

1314
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,770
I saved Lube.

1315
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,630
The wind keeps taking its time!

1316
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,610
Like, I don't know what to do!

1317
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,270
This...

1318
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,990
This is tough.

1319
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,490
But they won't take any damage.

1320
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,450
Why won't people do me?

1321
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,330
I'm trying... Let me in!

1322
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,170
You have to let me in!

1323
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:35,350
No way.

1324
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,150
I'm gonna lose.

1325
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:37,330
Ah!

1326
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,710
They blocked the door!

1327
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,890
How did he get in?

1328
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,730
How did he get in?

1329
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,790
So Hong Guy has retreated.

1330
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:50,950
Oh my god, there they are!

1331
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:51,810
Oh my god!

1332
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,470
Let me through!

1333
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,290
Let me through!

1334
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:53,830
No!

1335
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:54,670
Let me through!

1336
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,820
Oh, it's okay!

1337
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,180
Holy shit!

1338
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,340
There's so many people!

1339
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,460
Oh my god, don't wonder he died!

1340
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,460
No wonder!

1341
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,100
There's... Okay, I understand how he died.

1342
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,700
Oh my god.

1343
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,460
Oh my god, I'm so dead.

1344
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,440
I'm actually so dead.

1345
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,400
Oh my god, thank you!

1346
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:37,820
What?

1347
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,840
I died anyway!

1348
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,820
There's no way!

1349
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,340
Oh my god!

1350
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,440
There's no way!

1351
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,920
There's no way!

1352
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,760
That's not looking good.

1353
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,360
I just...

1354
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,880
And he died!

1355
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,520
Oh my god!

1356
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,740
Oh my god!

1357
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,840
Okay.

1358
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,460
That's fine.

1359
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,440
We can do this again.

1360
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,480
I think if I just defend...

1361
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,320
It's normal!

1362
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,040
That's the fucked up part!

1363
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,700
This is normal difficulty!

1364
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,160
That's the fucked up part!

1365
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,880
Like I don't understand how my team is struggling!

1366
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,980
Oh my god.

1367
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,720
Come on!

1368
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,180
Come on!

1369
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:34,960
Okay.

1370
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,140
I'm trying... I don't understand why you closed... Why are these guards not helping you?

1371
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,260
Why are your guards not helping you?

1372
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,440
I don't understand!

1373
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,320
Okay.

1374
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,620
There you go!

1375
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,240
Oh my god, Lupe was literally 180.

1376
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,900
That's actually crazy.

1377
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,200
Lupe was actually 1 HP there.

1378
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,240
You should fall back and regroup.

1379
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,220
Oh my god.

1380
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,020
He was actually 1 HP.

1381
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,500
I got this!

1382
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,380
Everything is lining up perfectly.

1383
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,480
Oh yeah!

1384
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,500
You think it's lining up perfectly?

1385
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,360
How do you think it's lining up perfectly?

1386
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,120
We're all dying!

1387
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,580
The enemy officer...

1388
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,680
Why would you think it's perfect?

1389
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,980
Everyone is dying!

1390
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,900
The enemy officer is coming to help.

1391
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,760
Thank you for coming.

1392
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,000
Why would you think that?

1393
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,460
No way.

1394
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,440
I'm gonna lose.

1395
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,180
Okay.

1396
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,480
Alright.

1397
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,660
Okay.

1398
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,740
Okay.

1399
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,700
One guy has appeared!

1400
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,160
Okay.

1401
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,520
Oh my god.

1402
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:47,660
Ice!

1403
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:52,920
Oh no.

1404
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
There we go.

1405
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,260
Here we go.

1406
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,020
Here we go.

1407
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,060
Okay, we'll defeat one more!

1408
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,180
I'm gonna defeat one more!

1409
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,320
And then I'm coming back!

1410
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,140
Alright!

1411
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,780
There's no way!

1412
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,200
You're gonna struggle against Jeng Liao.

1413
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,940
There's no way!

1414
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:15,700
Alright!

1415
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,760
We go back!

1416
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,100
We go back!

1417
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,260
Oh my god!

1418
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,420
Oh my god!

1419
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,540
Please!

1420
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,060
I killed them all!

1421
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:27,760
Oh my god!

1422
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,440
We gotta go back!

1423
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,160
We gotta make it back!

1424
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:29,860
Jukollin!

1425
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,520
Jukollin!

1426
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,260
Don't die!

1427
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,500
Do not die!

1428
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,320
Jukollin!

1429
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,700
Oh no!

1430
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:36,620
Oh no!

1431
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,740
We're here for you!

1432
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,980
Do not die!

1433
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,880
The wind is already beginning to change.

1434
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,660
It has!

1435
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,500
Oh my god!

1436
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,600
Please for the love of god!

1437
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:46,660
Please!

1438
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,060
Please hold on for a little longer!

1439
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,640
I'm actually almost there!

1440
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,360
Please for the love of god!

1441
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,280
Just hold out!

1442
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,080
For just a little longer!

1443
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,720
Has it changed?

1444
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,500
Oh my god!

1445
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,140
It's changed!

1446
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,620
It's changed!

1447
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,100
We gotta go to the tower!

1448
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,280
Jukollin!

1449
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:04,600
Live!

1450
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,440
I swear!

1451
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,540
It's changed!

1452
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,460
It's changed!

1453
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,660
How do I light the fire?

1454
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,860
How do I light it?

1455
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,000
Not good.

1456
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,700
How do I light the fire?

1457
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,720
I don't know how!

1458
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,720
Oh my god!

1459
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,380
Light it!

1460
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,380
This is our chance.

1461
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,640
There you go!

1462
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,080
This is it!

1463
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,180
Let the plan lead us down the path to victory.

1464
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,680
I'm pretty sure I didn't fuck it up.

1465
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,180
Oh!

1466
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,760
The signal!

1467
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,120
Whoop!

1468
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,520
Welcome to the tomato fire!

1469
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:39,960
Welcome!

1470
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,260
Welcome!

1471
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,580
I live!

1472
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,040
Why?

1473
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,980
Oh my god!

1474
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,340
Jesus Christ!

1475
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,420
This fight!

1476
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,880
Oh my god!

1477
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:02,740
Jesus Christ!

1478
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:03,680
A lovely wind!

1479
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,060
Thank you!

1480
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,500
That's right!

1481
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,380
Just keep streaming at the wind!

1482
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,320
That will convince it!

1483
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,080
If I yell at the...

1484
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,800
If I yell in the sky loud enough...

1485
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,480
They will...

1486
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,360
It will happen!

1487
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,900
I should've shot arrows at the wind!

1488
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,300
I should've shot arrows in the sky!

1489
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,280
Maybe they'll change the wind!

1490
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,580
Give that you've been willing to oppose even allies in the name of Wu!

1491
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,740
Everyone would find her defection believable!

1492
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,240
But...

1493
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,460
Doing this will result in much grief for you, Lord HuangGai!

1494
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,300
Are you still willing?

1495
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,560
Hmph!

1496
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,860
I don't know how you can...

1497
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,140
I...

1498
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,320
Trying to beat this level on heart must be like...

1499
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:50,800
My train...

1500
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,400
Is more painful...

1501
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,380
Than a thousand...

1502
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,020
Like...

1503
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,580
People who chat...

1504
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,840
Beat this level on heart...

1505
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,680
Are you okay?

1506
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,460
However...

1507
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,780
It is even worse to fail to protect...

1508
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,520
My...

1509
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,160
No!

1510
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,400
I...

1511
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,680
I'm definitely not okay!

1512
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,360
Lord Soto!

1513
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,720
This is where you...

1514
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,340
And I part ways!

1515
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,540
So please accept this...

1516
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,700
Grand apology!

1517
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,340
These flames are...

1518
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,800
The roar of Ooze!

1519
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,120
Counterattack!

1520
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,900
Yeah!

1521
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,260
Finally!

1522
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,460
Jesus Christ!

1523
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,440
But like...

1524
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,540
90% of them aren't even on boats!

1525
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,540
Like I...

1526
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,080
The плохо of oil episodes!

1527
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,520
The only worst part!

1528
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,840
Is just the factor!

1529
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,480
The majority of these people are not even on boats!

1530
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,840
So like...

1531
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,760
I don't know...

1532
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,400
Iと...

1533
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,000
I don't know how...

1534
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,180
Okay...

1535
00:52:59,180 --> 00:52:59,580
We are back on track!

1536
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,460
Where did you- Where?

1537
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,400
Where are you shoot- Hiiiiitkk...

1538
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,300
ridership...

1539
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,640
...90% of them are already at my base!

1540
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,260
Drexco's raised!

1541
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,160
Where is you shooting?

1542
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,240
Dude!

1543
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,180
Jesus.

1544
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,400
Okay.

1545
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,480
Okay.

1546
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,980
Oh, thank God.

1547
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,880
Exactly as you ordered, boss.

1548
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,660
Oh my God.

1549
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,820
I can't believe it.

1550
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,780
I survived.

1551
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,180
I survived the battle of Red Cliff.

1552
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,420
That should be on my shirt.

1553
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,560
I did not know better, I would say.

1554
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,520
Yes, indeed.

1555
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,260
Your presumption is on the mark.

1556
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,720
My allegiance is with them.

1557
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,300
Oh my God, I did it.

1558
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,440
Farewell, Shishu.

1559
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,220
I hope we can meet again someday.

1560
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,060
That's fucking right.

1561
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:01,580
Run!

1562
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,160
Run, you bitch!

1563
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:04,900
That's right!

1564
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,960
I'm taking back my base, too!

1565
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,920
I really changed to make the fire attack possible.

1566
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,200
Lord Chugoyang must be some kind of sorcerer attack.

1567
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:20,620
I survived the battle and all I got was a lousy shit.

1568
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,360
I will come to be known, not as a strategist, but as a...

1569
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,620
I'm just happy it's over.

1570
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,880
I'm so relaxed now.

1571
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,340
I'm so... I'm so relaxed after that.

1572
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,060
Like, holy fuck.

1573
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,240
Well, my part here is done.

1574
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,740
I must go now...

1575
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,360
Oh my God.

1576
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,200
...to plan for the next battle.

1577
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,400
Wait, I'm gonna kill you.

1578
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,940
We gotta make it real so people don't know you betrayed us.

1579
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,900
We gotta make this real, bro!

1580
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,700
So people won't know!

1581
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,340
Neither flame nor sword has been defeated.

1582
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,400
There we go.

1583
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,180
So, these chains were part of the enemy's plan.

1584
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,760
Then, we'll need to remove them quickly.

1585
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,720
Wait, is the game volume a bit low?

1586
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,720
Wait, that's...

1587
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,260
Shoot, it's the same volume I used before.

1588
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,940
I'll boost it up a little.

1589
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,380
That's weird.

1590
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,560
Okay, let me double check.

1591
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,720
Dynasty...

1592
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,620
Warriors...

1593
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,840
Is that the same one I used?

1594
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,980
Yeah, it's the same...

1595
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,480
Volume I always use for Dynasty Warriors.

1596
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,020
That's weird if it's a bit low.

1597
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,600
But I boosted it up.

1598
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,940
I boosted it a little bit higher.

1599
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:41,660
Alright.

1600
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:44,640
Oh!

1601
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,400
Alright.

1602
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,380
The sound guy is here and can let me know.

1603
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,040
Also, it might be the mic thing, too.

1604
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,040
Preventing further sacrifices is my top priority now.

1605
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,900
Alright, let's kill him.

1606
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,920
That's right, I came over to beat your ass!

1607
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,440
You can just avoid the flames.

1608
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,620
All is not yet lost.

1609
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,580
I wasn't.

1610
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,440
Oh my god.

1611
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,020
We lost so many generals.

1612
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,380
This is where we make our stand.

1613
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,340
We're moving towards the North Bank?

1614
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,060
Why are you going to the North Bank?

1615
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,960
Oh my god!

1616
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,420
Our morale is so high!

1617
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,480
Where are we going?

1618
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:33,880
Where are we going?

1619
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,040
I don't even know where...

1620
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,160
I never thought we'd get this far!

1621
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,580
I never thought we'd get this far.

1622
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,620
Where do I go now?

1623
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,400
Many of the ships are burning down.

1624
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,080
You need to make sure we take the right path forward.

1625
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:51,800
Would you?

1626
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,160
Alright.

1627
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,020
Please honor me in a duel.

1628
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,900
I have nothing but reservations about fighting you.

1629
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,420
Who wants to duel me?

1630
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,900
Who wants to duel me?

1631
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,380
I'm ready!

1632
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:02,800
What should I withdraw?

1633
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,840
We gotta make this look real, bro.

1634
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,920
We got...

1635
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,460
We know you betrayed, but...

1636
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,740
We gotta make this look real!

1637
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,180
Or tell no!

1638
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,000
So...

1639
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,440
We're gonna hang back here.

1640
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:19,980
Alright.

1641
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,000
Nice.

1642
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,440
I don't think they know that we...

1643
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,640
I don't think he knows.

1644
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,800
Okay, let me get rid...

1645
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,340
I won't get rid of all these bosses, Chris.

1646
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:32,900
Nice acting, bro.

1647
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,700
Okay.

1648
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,340
And then...

1649
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,540
Get out of here!

1650
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:39,840
That's right!

1651
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,180
I had to grind off stream!

1652
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,240
That's fucking right!

1653
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,260
Our allies are doing well.

1654
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,780
Keep it going.

1655
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,480
That's what you guys get!

1656
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,160
I like how...

1657
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,620
Oh.

1658
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,000
The game audience is a bit too loud now?

1659
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,360
Okay.

1660
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,680
Alright.

1661
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,720
Let me fix it again.

1662
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,040
I'll fix it again, guys.

1663
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:05,880
Alright.

1664
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,740
There we go.

1665
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,680
Alright.

1666
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,020
Here we go.

1667
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,760
Oh, no.

1668
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:11,760
How...

1669
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,240
I need to know how to get over to the other side.

1670
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,660
Oh, I should have followed my team.

1671
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:17,740
I...

1672
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,860
I should have followed my team!

1673
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,060
How do I get to the other side?

1674
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,980
To form the perfect plan.

1675
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,880
There's nothing more...

1676
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,160
I can do here!

1677
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:28,500
This way...

1678
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,360
And then...

1679
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,600
This way...

1680
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,460
Oh my god.

1681
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,540
They're ready to charge.

1682
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,740
And I got distracted.

1683
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,200
They're like, We're ready!

1684
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,400
We're just waiting for you right now!

1685
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,660
And I'm like, Okay.

1686
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,800
I feel like...

1687
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,340
That I was not paying attention.

1688
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,480
But I'm heading over.

1689
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:46,940
Don't worry.

1690
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:47,580
I'm almost...

1691
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:47,800
Okay.

1692
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,880
I went the wrong way.

1693
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,020
Don't worry.

1694
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,900
I'm almost there.

1695
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:53,940
Alright.

1696
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,460
Okay.

1697
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,840
It looks like south-south forces are gathering on the northern coastline.

1698
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:58,980
Okay.

1699
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,820
Do you need to wait for me?

1700
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,400
We must be prepared.

1701
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:02,640
Wait!

1702
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,080
Please!

1703
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,140
The fire attack was very effective.

1704
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,260
The enemy must be exhausted.

1705
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,040
Wait for me!

1706
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,040
If we all work together, victory will be ours.

1707
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:11,360
Okay.

1708
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:11,920
One guy.

1709
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,920
You really had us deceived.

1710
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,620
Oh, I think I meant I went the wrong way.

1711
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,860
I'm gonna make a fool out of me.

1712
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,080
Oh, wait!

1713
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:22,760
Wait!

1714
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,740
It's time for us to finish this.

1715
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,280
I'm going to Suquan!

1716
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,920
Give me a sec!

1717
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,040
I'm so ready!

1718
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,120
Alright.

1719
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,180
Wait.

1720
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,100
How did he...

1721
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,180
How did he get there?

1722
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,660
Oh, it's this way!

1723
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,780
Suquan, wait!

1724
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,580
I almost fucked it up!

1725
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,020
I'm a little lost!

1726
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,280
I'm ready.

1727
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,180
Let's go!

1728
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:46,800
Slaughter!

1729
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,880
Me and...

1730
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,180
NPC number one.

1731
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,780
This is what we've been waiting for.

1732
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,460
It's a little awkward.

1733
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,660
It's a little awkward that...

1734
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,640
I can sort of like...

1735
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,880
Okay, let's see.

1736
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,480
So what am I going to do?

1737
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:06,640
It's a little awkward that like, I went with the like, NPC guys.

1738
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,920
Instead of like, you know, my actual team.

1739
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,880
And like, that's alright.

1740
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:14,140
These turbulent times dictate such things.

1741
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:14,820
Nice.

1742
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:14,940
Nice.

1743
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,500
I can't see anything.

1744
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,580
But nice.

1745
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,940
Jesus Christ, there's so many people.

1746
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,600
Wait.

1747
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,040
It's time!

1748
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,540
I shall be a real warrior now.

1749
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:29,740
Ice Strike!

1750
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,200
Show them our unity.

1751
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,620
Oh shit, what did he do?

1752
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,000
Oh, defeat.

1753
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:36,680
Oh, that's easy.

1754
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,680
Did I do it?

1755
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,840
I think...

1756
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,600
I think that's it, right?

1757
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:48,940
No.

1758
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:49,280
Wait.

1759
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,580
How did I not get 300 after that?

1760
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,680
Oh, whoa.

1761
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,320
Okay.

1762
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,820
Whoa.

1763
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:56,800
Oh, I did it.

1764
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,120
Don't worry.

1765
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,060
It was just catching up.

1766
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,280
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1767
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,720
Oh my god.

1768
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,880
Everybody's...

1769
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,500
They're all just dead.

1770
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,500
Holy fuck.

1771
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,280
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1772
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:11,700
Nice.

1773
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,540
I don't know how...

1774
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,220
Guys, everybody just dies.

1775
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,780
That was crazy.

1776
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:20,700
Okay.

1777
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,200
Okay, he just said he can't lose.

1778
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,940
I don't believe.

1779
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,320
Oh fuck!

1780
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:29,640
Okay.

1781
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,180
I need to kill him.

1782
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,280
He's literally one HP.

1783
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,720
Come on.

1784
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,620
You're so close to dying!

1785
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:37,440
Come on!

1786
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:37,980
Yes!

1787
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,260
The enemy officer has been defeated.

1788
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,540
Take this!

1789
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,040
Alright, I need to kill all these guys for extra.

1790
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,640
What?

1791
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,760
Okay, that's...

1792
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,180
Oh my god!

1793
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:57,680
I got it!

1794
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,880
Jesus Christ, you fucker.

1795
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,640
You fucker!

1796
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:04,600
That's right!

1797
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,520
Get your Musou out of here!

1798
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,220
We're fighting a losing battle.

1799
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:09,940
Oh, no.

1800
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,780
Oh, I dodged it.

1801
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:12,920
What do you mean?

1802
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,000
How did you guys all die?

1803
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:15,900
Oh no.

1804
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:17,840
Okay.

1805
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:19,720
Come on!

1806
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,580
Is Musou so close?

1807
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:25,040
Just one more hit!

1808
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,520
Nice!

1809
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,360
Oh!

1810
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,400
Fifteen seconds!

1811
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,580
Let's go close!

1812
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,340
Oh!

1813
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:33,880
Alright!

1814
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,700
Chao Chao, it's just you!

1815
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,820
All your friends are dead!

1816
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,340
You made me level up off stream, you fucker!

1817
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,520
Get out of here!

1818
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:45,560
Boom!

1819
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:45,840
Boom!

1820
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,360
Easy!

1821
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,160
It's not like this fight took me like...

1822
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,560
A whole day...

1823
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,560
To fucking...

1824
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:55,920
Finish!

1825
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,200
Oh my god!

1826
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,360
This fucking fight!

1827
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:00,760
Oh!

1828
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,060
I'm so happy it's over!

1829
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,060
It's so easy!

1830
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:08,360
Easy!

1831
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,040
Oh!

1832
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,560
King Lee is hanging in there!

1833
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:26,820
Finally!

1834
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,020
Finally!

1835
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,460
King Lee has already put a new plan into place!

1836
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,800
We should begin our pursuit as well!

1837
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,680
Holy fuck!

1838
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,240
I'm so happy!

1839
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:43,920
Jesus Christ!

1840
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,440
That level fucking...

1841
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,820
Like I love Battle of Redcliff!

1842
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:49,880
Or Battle of Chibi!

1843
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,160
But...

1844
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,540
Jesus!

1845
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,200
Oh my god!

1846
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,300
That was so...

1847
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,640
That was so intense!

1848
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,000
I literally have to run left!

1849
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:58,560
Run right!

1850
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,140
Run left!

1851
01:03:59,320 --> 01:03:59,860
Run right!

1852
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,680
I have to...

1853
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:05,600
Junkle!

1854
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,520
Left and right!

1855
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,260
Kill one boss!

1856
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,320
Go to the left side!

1857
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,100
Kill two!

1858
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,000
Go to the right!

1859
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,740
Watch four people die!

1860
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,900
Go to the left side!

1861
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:14,740
And...

1862
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,600
Jesus!

1863
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,160
It was hell!

1864
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:19,100
I...

1865
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:19,860
It was...

1866
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,220
It was actual hell!

1867
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,560
Oh my god!

1868
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,700
My horse leveled up from all that too!

1869
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:31,750
Nice!

1870
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:32,390
Alright!

1871
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:33,890
Defense!

1872
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:34,710
Strength!

1873
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:35,510
I need...

1874
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:36,310
I need strength!

1875
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,470
One last battle!

1876
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,830
One final battle chat!

1877
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:42,870
Is that?

1878
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:47,270
What did the wind change?

1879
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,330
The stupid fucking wind!

1880
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,130
Fifty-four!

1881
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:01,190
Druid P heeeet All right.

1882
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,050
I don't understand.

1883
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,630
You can only use one of these medicines, too.

1884
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,270
That's the most fucked up part.

1885
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:16,250
All right, I want to see if there's any... I'll make sure if there's any, like, any romance in my Three Kingdoms.

1886
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:19,530
Oh,

1887
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:23,650
no one?

1888
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,130
It's the last battle!

1889
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,050
I can't believe it!

1890
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:35,530
No one wants to talk to me on the final battle?

1891
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,170
What was it all for?

1892
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,170
I can't believe no one wants to talk to me!

1893
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,530
I thought we had something!

1894
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:56,010
Oh, my God.

1895
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:00,030
After everything we've been through?

1896
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,370
Okay, we gotta go...

1897
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,150
I guess we'll go here.

1898
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:13,250
We've been through so much together!

1899
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,330
Where's...

1900
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:19,170
Where's my last...

1901
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,030
My last interaction?

1902
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,310
Yeah.

1903
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:27,030
I have the Oblivion gem equipped, which is good.

1904
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,070
Is it because I let them die?

1905
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,490
Is that it?

1906
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,130
Is that it?

1907
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,130
Oh, my God.

1908
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,150
Oh, my God!

1909
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,010
It's burning!

1910
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,790
Holy fuck!

1911
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:48,850
Jesus!

1912
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:49,810
Okay, I like that.

1913
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,690
The little touch that they did.

1914
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:52,430
Ah!

1915
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:53,570
Okay.

1916
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:56,290
Is this battle harder than QB?

1917
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,150
We'll find out.

1918
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,010
Let's find out.

1919
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,170
About the same?

1920
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:15,510
The resolve of Wu's officers is laudable indeed.

1921
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:21,250
And yet, the thread of Cao Cao's life has yet to be severed.

1922
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:27,650
It would seem he means to converge with his rearguard from Huarong Path.

1923
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:38,870
That is why I have tasked Lords Zhao Yun, Zhang Fei, and Guan Yu to lie in wait and ambush him.

1924
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:46,050
I need you to pursue Cao Cao and pin him between you and those three.

1925
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,470
Don't worry, I got this.

1926
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:52,410
But I'm also going to grab Guan Yu with me.

1927
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:53,750
Now then.

1928
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:56,790
Let's see what our next move is.

1929
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,090
Yansuke, thank you for the super chat.

1930
01:07:59,250 --> 01:07:59,470
Thank you.

1931
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,250
Thank you.

1932
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:03,330
You can try to bribe Peng Tong to help finishing his friend mission.

1933
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:04,030
I did!

1934
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:04,690
He won't!

1935
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:07,430
Oh, I can grab Guan Yu, but I did!

1936
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:09,090
He won't take my money!

1937
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:12,030
I bribed all of them!

1938
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,190
Liu Bei's forces...

1939
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:16,870
He won't take my money!

1940
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:19,290
This...

1941
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:22,030
is all part of the Long Zong plan.

1942
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:23,090
I don't understand.

1943
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:26,410
I have so much money to spend just for host club.

1944
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:30,330
Giant Fei and Xiao Yun are in position.

1945
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,250
I don't understand.

1946
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:35,530
Wait, where am I pursuing...

1947
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:35,730
Here?

1948
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:38,710
I assume it's here, right?

1949
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,990
Which way?

1950
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:42,130
I don't know which way!

1951
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,890
Instructions are clear!

1952
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,310
Which way was I supposed to go?

1953
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:53,530
I should have paid attention in school.

1954
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,470
I'm sorry, Drew Gotler.

1955
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:04,550
I wasn't really listening to be fair on which way you wanted me to pursue.

1956
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:08,570
Open the door!

1957
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:12,250
You will not escape me!

1958
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,630
Prepare to die, TaoTao!

1959
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,490
Oh, I could have went the other way.

1960
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,090
Oh, well, I'm already here.

1961
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,030
I should have paid attention to him.

1962
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,010
Okay, I just made it.

1963
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:26,650
Okay.

1964
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:31,270
Ice!

1965
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:34,810
Nice!

1966
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:36,790
Okay, we gotta get rid of this base.

1967
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:37,790
How is there still people?

1968
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:38,550
Oh, they're all over here.

1969
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,810
Why are you guys in the corner?

1970
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,530
Your leader died!

1971
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:47,860
Oh my god, whoops.

1972
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:49,910
Open the door!

1973
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:53,010
It is well worth the effort to reorganize our forces so quickly.

1974
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:53,950
Oh, I should have went the other way.

1975
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:55,070
Okay.

1976
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,690
Please, make your way up the mountain path.

1977
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,330
I should have...

1978
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,250
Guys, I should have went the other way, guys.

1979
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:04,510
I...

1980
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:04,970
I...

1981
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:05,330
I...

1982
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:09,390
The other way might have been faster, guys.

1983
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:11,650
I am the impenetrable shield.

1984
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:12,870
Wait, do I...

1985
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:15,590
Do I even fight them?

1986
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,390
Even a thousand glows would be enough to break my guard!

1987
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:18,550
Oh, shit!

1988
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:19,250
No, I wasn't!

1989
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:22,890
I'm sorry, I got distracted!

1990
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:27,550
No shield is big enough to withstand its wrath!

1991
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:28,650
Sorry, I got distracted!

1992
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:29,470
I'm coming over!

1993
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:30,490
I finally made it.

1994
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:33,490
Now...

1995
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:34,350
I can...

1996
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:36,430
Don't worry, I'm coming over for real this time.

1997
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,370
You, Tao Tao.

1998
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:39,350
I'm coming over!

1999
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:41,390
In the hands of Chang-fei!

2000
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:43,790
Open the door!

2001
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:44,930
I'll open it myself!

2002
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,850
That's right!

2003
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:48,470
So...

2004
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:51,050
You've been lying in wait all along.

2005
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:51,910
Don't worry.

2006
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:52,250
I'm here.

2007
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:53,710
Still...

2008
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:57,850
No matter how strong you are, I will not be impeded.

2009
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:58,870
Don't worry, I'm here now!

2010
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,710
Sorry, I got distracted, but I'm here!

2011
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,670
We're going after Tao Tao.

2012
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:05,090
Don't worry!

2013
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:05,210
Sorry!

2014
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:08,730
I totally did not get distracted doing this.

2015
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,670
Oh my god.

2016
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:17,950
It's okay, I got Fred.

2017
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:24,190
Oh, yes, let's go.

2018
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,810
Wait, I didn't even say yes.

2019
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,310
He just demanded it.

2020
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,070
This can't be...

2021
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:41,550
What happened?!

2022
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,490
What happened?!

2023
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:52,940
What?!

2024
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,440
He just... he hit me!

2025
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,060
Bro!

2026
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,720
Bro, this one guy is blocking me.

2027
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,040
What the f...

2028
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,480
Bro just...

2029
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,800
Bro just slapped me and I died!

2030
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,520
He's so cool.

2031
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,630
Bro, he actually...

2032
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,040
He just fucking slapped me and it was over!

2033
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:29,650
Like, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!

2034
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,960
I don't even know what I was supposed to do there!

2035
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,180
Please continue onward.

2036
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,280
I will keep the enemy officer...

2037
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:43,980
Oh my god.

2038
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,460
Oh my god, there's so many things.

2039
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,560
Okay, I'm just gonna...

2040
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,480
I'm gonna save my...

2041
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,040
I'm gonna save my thing.

2042
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,900
Just in case he does that again.

2043
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,540
No, no, no, no!

2044
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:57,820
No!

2045
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,500
Okay.

2046
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,580
Okay, round two.

2047
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,080
But a different guy now.

2048
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,880
Okay, I blocked it.

2049
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,100
Easy.

2050
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,540
Okay, I blocked it.

2051
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,880
I'm just gonna keep my energy thing.

2052
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,000
Because like, I...

2053
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,300
I'm scared.

2054
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:24,780
I'm scared.

2055
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,120
Okay, nice.

2056
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:30,580
Okay.

2057
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:31,980
That's fine.

2058
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:36,120
It's not as bad as whatever the fuck Shaohu didn't try to do to me.

2059
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,180
Cause that was fucking scary.

2060
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,220
Okay, nice.

2061
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:48,940
Nice.

2062
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:49,860
Alright.

2063
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,480
Alright, we got him out of the way.

2064
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,580
Wait, what?

2065
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,220
He like, just left me?

2066
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,400
I was having a fight with one of his...

2067
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,000
I'm getting out of here.

2068
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,500
That's right, I'm here.

2069
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,620
I need to charge up my thing.

2070
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,260
I need to charge this up.

2071
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,020
Just in case.

2072
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,840
I even think he was a super chat.

2073
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,320
I'm just making sure I have like...

2074
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,560
Half the...

2075
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,140
Enough of the counter.

2076
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,080
In case he does that again.

2077
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,620
I'm scared.

2078
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,760
I'm too scared.

2079
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,640
Jesus Christ!

2080
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,660
This is where we make our stand.

2081
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,600
What just happened?

2082
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,260
We must be ready to die.

2083
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,020
Oh my god.

2084
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,960
I don't wanna use my special attack just in case it happens again!

2085
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,680
You must deal with the enemy quickly and forge ahead.

2086
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:58,720
Just starting.

2087
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,520
Alright.

2088
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,700
Help you surround it if I'm not careful.

2089
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,120
Please.

2090
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,380
Change course and head south.

2091
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,420
I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared.

2092
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,860
Now for our second stroke.

2093
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,660
Oh my god.

2094
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:13,160
Please!

2095
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,020
Okay, I have enough.

2096
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:15,760
I have enough.

2097
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,360
I have enough to stop it.

2098
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,500
Take this.

2099
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:24,920
Oh.

2100
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,640
Easy.

2101
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:26,480
Okay.

2102
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,120
Okay.

2103
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,020
Good job!

2104
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:30,960
Doki.

2105
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,200
Doki.

2106
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,240
Doki this is what killed me.

2107
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,440
Like that move is what killed me.

2108
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,740
That move is so fucking scary.

2109
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:39,740
Like...

2110
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:44,060
I need to always have enough just to counter that one move.

2111
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,240
Take this.

2112
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,160
Okay.

2113
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:49,680
Oh!

2114
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,400
Oh, thank God.

2115
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:52,700
Okay.

2116
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,280
I'm not scared anymore.

2117
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,260
There's a different escape point?

2118
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,140
Wait, where did he go?

2119
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:01,460
What?

2120
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:04,540
Wait, he, like, ran.

2121
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,560
Oh, my God.

2122
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,960
He used him as bait?

2123
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,460
Okay, but, like, I want to kill him first.

2124
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,980
I like how... I can't believe it!

2125
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,440
He used him as bait!

2126
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,800
That's so smart!

2127
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:29,220
Wait, I can change?

2128
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,740
All right.

2129
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,160
Okay.

2130
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,260
Nice.

2131
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,260
It's time to meet Jonfei.

2132
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,140
All right.

2133
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:44,940
I'm gonna use this.

2134
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,380
Okay, I thought he would stop.

2135
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,760
I don't know why.

2136
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,400
I just stopped.

2137
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,820
I... for some reason, I thought he would stop and wait.

2138
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,240
I don't know why I expected that.

2139
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,260
The arrival of the reinforcements is as predicted.

2140
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,520
Continue your pursuit of it's outside while crushing any enemies in the past.

2141
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,740
Oh, no!

2142
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,880
Like, you know, to watch the 1v1?

2143
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:20,620
I thought he would watch the... I thought he would want to watch the 1v1.

2144
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,140
finally ready for our Lord's arrival.

2145
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,040
Hmm.

2146
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,080
This is a miracle that he has made it this far already.

2147
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:26,480
Welcome to this.

2148
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,680
The enemy officer has been defeated.

2149
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,100
Okay.

2150
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:32,000
Okay.

2151
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,540
Okay, he might be, like, a little on high ground, but I still got him.

2152
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,420
Everything depends on this moment.

2153
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,060
Whoa!

2154
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,300
We must see our Lord to safety.

2155
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:41,940
Take this.

2156
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,140
Lord Saltao, keep going.

2157
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:48,480
Okay, we got him.

2158
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,800
All right, we need him.

2159
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,640
The enemy counter has been defeated.

2160
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:56,640
A man of your strength will survive to stand at my side again.

2161
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:56,980
Don't worry!

2162
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,280
I... I can make it!

2163
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,320
I can make it!

2164
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,340
Don't worry!

2165
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,640
Tsuko Young has predicted their every move thus far.

2166
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:05,940
Let's go!

2167
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,280
His insight is incredible.

2168
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,940
Okay, not this way.

2169
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:11,620
I can make it.

2170
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:12,380
Don't worry, guys.

2171
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,540
Okay, I need these jars, though.

2172
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,320
We're fighting Tsau-Tsau's forces on our own.

2173
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,420
Will this put us on equal footing with who?

2174
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:22,240
I'm almost there.

2175
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,180
This plan has taken every detail into account.

2176
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:26,920
Nubi's got this!

2177
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:27,460
I believe!

2178
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:31,200
All that remains is for me to carry out my part in it.

2179
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,300
Okay, that side, I...

2180
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,940
You know when they said, like, oh, yeah, they, like, blocked it?

2181
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,100
I... For some reason, I didn't think they actually blocked it.

2182
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,100
I...

2183
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:43,800
Come on.

2184
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:44,420
Come on.

2185
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:47,640
And of course, Liu Bei is my final obstacle.

2186
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:48,180
Let's go.

2187
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:50,400
I'm heading over.

2188
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,380
I'm heading over.

2189
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,780
All those with the strength to enforce their will...

2190
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:56,660
Come on.

2191
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,200
Come on, little guy!

2192
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,440
You've got this!

2193
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:02,660
Today, we fight to clear a path for tomorrow!

2194
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,800
Come on, my horse!

2195
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,100
We're almost there!

2196
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,040
He's so close!

2197
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,860
He's so close!

2198
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,680
He's so close!

2199
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,040
What?

2200
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:13,640
What?

2201
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,760
Liu Bei...

2202
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,560
Somehow I knew it would be you standing in my way.

2203
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,400
But it will gain you nothing.

2204
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:21,840
Excuse me?

2205
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:22,640
What about me?

2206
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,020
You will not end my rule!

2207
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,000
Lord Cao Cao.

2208
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,440
What did he do?

2209
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,160
I have gathered the strength and the will to stand against you.

2210
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:33,580
He just shows up!

2211
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,280
It is time for our final battle.

2212
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:36,760
Oh, Liu Bei.

2213
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:38,340
Who?

2214
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,280
We all know Liu Bei was the one that stopped this entire fight.

2215
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,140
The rest is up to you.

2216
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:44,420
Up to you.

2217
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:45,180
Up to you.

2218
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:46,140
Up to you.

2219
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:46,960
That's right.

2220
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,700
Who's on standby?

2221
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,440
I'm literally fighting right now!

2222
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,360
Who the fuck is on standby?

2223
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:55,680
Who the fuck is on standby?

2224
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,400
Who's charging right now?

2225
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,300
Forward as a lord.

2226
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,480
We will win this deck.

2227
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:03,600
And we will share our dream with the world.

2228
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,440
Concentrate.

2229
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:04,740
Alright.

2230
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,060
Get iced.

2231
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,940
Get iced.

2232
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,020
Get iced!

2233
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:10,460
Get iced!

2234
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,480
Okay, where is he?

2235
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,980
Wait, where's Cao Cao?

2236
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:17,420
Oh!

2237
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,940
Okay, that's not Cao Cao.

2238
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,660
Where is he?

2239
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,280
Oh, wait!

2240
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:22,940
Oh shit!

2241
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,220
I shall retreat now.

2242
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,840
See that I might fight again another day.

2243
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,180
Where is he?

2244
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:30,260
What the hell?

2245
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,360
Honor me in a duel.

2246
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:32,980
Oh, yes!

2247
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,240
Yes!

2248
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:35,500
Let me duel you!

2249
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,180
I will prove the strength of my hero.

2250
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:39,660
Oops, I missed.

2251
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,580
Oh, I missed again.

2252
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,280
It's okay.

2253
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:42,900
I used strength.

2254
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,520
Lord Guan Yu, this battle is in your hands.

2255
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:49,760
Okay.

2256
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,420
We must win for the sake of Lord Nubei's dream for the world.

2257
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,360
Holy shit!

2258
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,760
There's so many of them!

2259
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,380
I am well aware of what's at stake.

2260
01:20:59,160 --> 01:20:59,680
Jesus!

2261
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,440
They're all just trying to fucking beat me up!

2262
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,020
Oh my god!

2263
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:05,120
Oh my god!

2264
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,380
The enemy's formation is beginning to fall apart.

2265
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,860
It's just all bosses!

2266
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:10,780
We can break through!

2267
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,280
It's just all bosses.

2268
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,700
It's really just all bosses.

2269
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:17,680
It's all bosses.

2270
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,540
Oh my god!

2271
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,860
This brings me back to when we first met.

2272
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,840
Okay, you guys...

2273
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,720
You guys deal with these bosses over here.

2274
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,700
I'll deal with Cao Cao.

2275
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,320
Our sense of duty and honor has not changed since.

2276
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:30,760
Nice.

2277
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,820
For now, to Liu Bei we have a great lord will the enemy officer.

2278
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:35,920
Oh my god!

2279
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:36,720
He's one HP.

2280
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:37,840
He's one HP.

2281
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:38,700
Nice.

2282
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,360
With every strike Okay, wrong way!

2283
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,180
Wrong way, guys!

2284
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:43,820
Wrong...

2285
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,320
Wrong way!

2286
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,980
I swear to god, if these guys killsteal me.

2287
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,160
I swear to god...

2288
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:53,880
It's fine.

2289
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,360
I'll...

2290
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,380
It's fine.

2291
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,260
I'm okay with kill stealing.

2292
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:56,780
I'm...

2293
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:57,740
I'm okay!

2294
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,820
As long as it's Gwanyun, I'm okay.

2295
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,780
We ended on Gwanyun.

2296
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,340
The real main character.

2297
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,340
Gwanyun with the kill-sicker.

2298
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,200
That's why he's a god of war.

2299
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,000
We did it.

2300
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,340
Oh my god.

2301
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,760
We finally did it.

2302
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,340
Holy fuck.

2303
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,360
What a large step it will be.

2304
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,260
Looking rough.

2305
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,860
Looking rough.

2306
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:02,840
Looking rough.

2307
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,180
Looking rough.

2308
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,140
Oh my god, we did it.

2309
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,980
It's over.

2310
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,300
Go, Lord Tau Tau.

2311
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:12,440
You won't cut me down.

2312
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,980
It's looking over.

2313
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,880
You saved the lives of people dear to me and my brother.

2314
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,940
And so I owe you a deep debt of gratitude.

2315
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,720
Disregarding that would not be a righteous act.

2316
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:30,240
And would not lead towards the future my brother dreams of.

2317
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,340
Still, remember well Tau Tau.

2318
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:35,900
One day.

2319
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:36,760
One day.

2320
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,720
The Yubei will surely surpass you.

2321
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,120
I like naturally.

2322
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,880
Oh Gwanyun.

2323
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,880
You are so foolish.

2324
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,340
I shall not allow that.

2325
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,440
My triumph over him is inevitable.

2326
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:02,550
With this, I have repaid my debt.

2327
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,500
Ah, it's you.

2328
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,620
You should have cut him down.

2329
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:21,220
I disagree.

2330
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,400
It was for the best.

2331
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,340
Lord Chuga Lian dispatched me to this place precisely.

2332
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,080
Because he knew I wouldn't cut down Lord Tau Tau.

2333
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:30,700
You idiot!

2334
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,840
Now Tau Tau Tau would definitely not win!

2335
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:35,080
If you guys, now you will be the next to the world of your strength.

2336
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:39,600
And if that happens, the long song plan shall not come to pass.

2337
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:43,860
The future and freedom of our people is at stake here.

2338
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:50,660
Although the world is wrought with turmoil, my brother still shines as a guiding light of righteousness.

2339
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:51,360
You fool!

2340
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,500
And although many have perished along the way, their sacrifices will not be in vain.

2341
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:02,440
All we can do now is strive to realize the long song plan.

2342
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,220
Trusting that it will bring us closer to achieving my brother's dream.

2343
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,160
I shall not allow him to lose sight of what he cherishes.

2344
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:15,240
That is, above all, my duty and privilege.

2345
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:17,520
But we will need your strength.

2346
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:23,300
After all, turning such dreams into reality will be no small feat.

2347
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,990
Oh my god, you fool!

2348
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:31,850
You've doomed us all, Gwonyun!

2349
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:34,150
You've doomed the kingdom!

2350
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:40,150
It could have been the Romance of the Two Kingdoms!

2351
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:41,970
Now you've made it three!

2352
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,830
He's like, yeah, but this sound is good.

2353
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,350
Three sounds better than two.

2354
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:54,970
And thus, Cao Cao's fleet sank into a sea of flames.

2355
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:57,550
Wu was vitalized by a strategic advantage.

2356
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:00,510
Their energy was matched by Cao Cao's pure strength.

2357
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:02,670
Liu Bei gained control of the Jing province.

2358
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:06,350
The first great step on the path of realizing Zhukot Lun's Longzheng plan.

2359
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:07,710
The age of the Three Kingdoms.

2360
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:08,090
No!

2361
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:12,350
Now you brought forth the Three Kingdoms!

2362
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:17,910
We could have been two!

2363
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:17,930
We could have been two!

2364
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:23,750
And that's how five Seema are you after!

2365
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:24,930
You fool!

2366
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:25,110
You fool!

2367
01:26:27,690 --> 01:26:30,570
But brother, Threeu sounds so much better!

2368
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:34,550
There's a lot to take care of after that battle.

2369
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:36,810
So you may as well rest up today.

2370
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,640
Are you sure that's okay?

2371
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:42,860
Come on now.

2372
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,240
Don't be like that.

2373
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,920
Kick your feet up now.

2374
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,160
You'll need the rest for the fighting to come.

2375
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,260
You ought to take time to relax now and again.

2376
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,740
Why have two when you can have three?

2377
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,640
Ancient China was just too big for Two Kingdoms.

2378
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:04,480
Everyone enjoying their own pursuits.

2379
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,860
Without the threat of some battle on the horizon.

2380
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,220
This might be exactly what brother is aiming for.

2381
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,740
You're right.

2382
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:16,980
You're right.

2383
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,160
That's why it's three brothers.

2384
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,440
That's why I got ridden out.

2385
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,600
Three brothers are better than four.

2386
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,560
I knew it!

2387
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:25,120
I knew it!

2388
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:25,500
I knew it!

2389
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,920
Rules of three!

2390
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,120
He likes the rules of three.

2391
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:30,620
Oh, but perfect timing.

2392
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,140
Didn't expect to see all of you here.

2393
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,280
Sorry, but could you lend a hand?

2394
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,320
A bear has appeared in the fields.

2395
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,600
A bear?

2396
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,520
This is Red and Bear doing.

2397
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:41,740
Leave it to me.

2398
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:52,320
Even this may be part of the first step toward accomplishing our dream.

2399
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:54,620
What?

2400
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,380
Killing a bear?

2401
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,070
There you are.

2402
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:13,130
The four of us were just talking about you.

2403
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:13,570
Me?

2404
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:15,190
Without a doubt.

2405
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:18,310
Your deeds in the last battle were heroic.

2406
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:19,210
That's me.

2407
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:25,890
According to military regulations, you must be rewarded with a rank and command befitting your achievements.

2408
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:31,090
Then again, your ability to act freely is your strong point, isn't it?

2409
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:35,350
I get the feeling a position like this wouldn't suit you all that well.

2410
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:37,190
Well, welcome to tomato farm.

2411
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:37,910
Welcome, welcome.

2412
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:40,150
We discussed it among ourselves, but could not come to a consensus in the end.

2413
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:42,430
That is why we would like you to choose.

2414
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:47,110
First, there is the path of the general and a life of public prominence.

2415
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,830
You may find yourself feeling a bit more stifled than you do now.

2416
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:55,890
Still, the fame and standing a generalship provides is well worth it.

2417
01:28:56,650 --> 01:29:00,530
Or, you may support us from the shadows without an official position.

2418
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:01,090
Wait a minute.

2419
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:03,810
You may find this role somewhat lacking in benefits.

2420
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:04,810
Yeah.

2421
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:07,170
But, in exchange, you can maintain...

2422
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:08,370
Wait, they're trying to write me out!

2423
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:10,130
You'll hear no objections from us.

2424
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:11,570
Wait!

2425
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:13,470
Wait a minute.

2426
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:15,110
They're trying to write me...

2427
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:16,630
They're trying to write me on history!

2428
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:18,950
They don't even want me to join them anymore!

2429
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:21,770
I wish them...

2430
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:22,910
I won the fame.

2431
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:26,790
You can't write me out.

2432
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:28,150
That's fucking right.

2433
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,510
I want me a general.

2434
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:30,550
Like...

2435
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:31,770
You can't write me out.

2436
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:33,050
I deserve credit!

2437
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:36,030
It's four brothers!

2438
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:37,610
This is...

2439
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:38,710
A good choice, I believe.

2440
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:43,250
Having you take up a command grants me no small measure of reassurance.

2441
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:46,670
Well, this is promising, isn't it?

2442
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:48,830
I'm gonna write my own book.

2443
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,570
I'll write my own romance of the four kingdoms.

2444
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:57,050
You ask much of me, Jonfei.

2445
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:58,170
I have my own kingdom.

2446
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:00,270
That said...

2447
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,330
I do owe you a great deal.

2448
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:06,050
I will have to think of something...

2449
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,990
That reflects my trust in you.

2450
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:20,030
Oh, there's my...

2451
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:21,310
There's my child doctor.

2452
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:24,090
How can I ever thank you enough for curing my father of that dreadful disease?

2453
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,250
It is I who should be thanking you.

2454
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:31,770
Your request allowed me to gain yet another valuable experience as a doctor.

2455
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:35,310
And I am always glad to be of service.

2456
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:38,350
Please tell him to take care of himself as he recovers.

2457
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:39,710
I will.

2458
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:41,310
Um...

2459
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:42,330
By the way...

2460
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:43,710
Master Yuanhua.

2461
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,150
Do you plan on leaving town already?

2462
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,010
Yes, I do.

2463
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:52,270
I've received word that my companion is waiting for me outside the castle.

2464
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:53,790
But...

2465
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:57,090
I am not really sure where we will be going next.

2466
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,770
And with that, I bid you farewell.

2467
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:01,390
Wait, he still follows me?

2468
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:03,090
I hope you never need to see me again.

2469
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:04,410
I...

2470
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:06,810
Okay, he's just living off of my free rent.

2471
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:08,770
Like...

2472
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:09,770
He still...

2473
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:12,190
He still follows me around?

2474
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,990
Master Yuanhua!

2475
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:15,930
Please, wait!

2476
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:18,630
Like, he's just mo...

2477
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:19,650
He's just leeching!

2478
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,270
He's a freeloader!

2479
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:22,950
Didn't I just say...

2480
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:26,370
I hope you never need to see me again?

2481
01:31:27,870 --> 01:31:29,210
Is something wrong?

2482
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:31,190
Have I...

2483
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:32,890
Left something behind, perhaps?

2484
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:35,790
No, it's just...

2485
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:37,270
Just what?

2486
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:41,010
Oh my god, now I have to take care of another guy?!

2487
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:42,330
Prentice...

2488
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,770
I've already discussed it with my father.

2489
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:49,030
You're the only one who made a real effort to treat him when...

2490
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,770
Every doctor in town gave up.

2491
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:53,030
And you were the one to finally cure him.

2492
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:55,570
Watching you do that, it...

2493
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,590
Changed me, as a man.

2494
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:59,550
I told my father.

2495
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:02,390
Imagine if I could become a doctor like him!

2496
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:04,830
Oh my god, now I have two freeloaders!

2497
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:07,830
I once would have dismissed the idea...

2498
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:10,490
As undeserved flattery.

2499
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:12,330
But...

2500
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:13,890
Yes...

2501
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:15,970
Perhaps it's not such a bad idea.

2502
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:20,910
I do need someone to inherit all of the wisdom and knowledge passed down to me after all.

2503
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,070
Then you...

2504
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:23,630
You could have your own son!

2505
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:24,390
I...

2506
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:26,050
I will accept you as my new apprentice.

2507
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:28,190
But no...

2508
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:30,770
When you want to pass down to someone with your blood?

2509
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:31,750
Or how much?

2510
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,850
Thank you so much, Master Yuanhua!

2511
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,030
Oh, uh...

2512
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:41,250
Yuanhua is your courtesy name, isn't it?

2513
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:45,690
I think I should know the true name of someone who's to be my mentor.

2514
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,570
Would you mind telling it to me?

2515
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:50,350
Oh...

2516
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:52,290
Why does he get his own cutscene?

2517
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:53,870
He was not that important.

2518
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:54,770
My name is...

2519
01:32:58,370 --> 01:32:59,370
It's Huatuo.

2520
01:32:59,370 --> 01:33:01,640
Please, call me Hua Yuanhua.

2521
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:05,630
Oh my...

2522
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:06,410
Wait, Huatuo?

2523
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:07,850
Huatuo.

2524
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:08,350
Sorry.

2525
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:09,210
Sorry.

2526
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:11,850
Sorry.

2527
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:13,110
Who is...

2528
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:14,330
That's so familiar.

2529
01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:18,510
That...

2530
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,550
That name is so familiar.

2531
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:23,410
I'm trying to...

2532
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:26,450
I am a bird with no wings.

2533
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:29,210
Dashed against the earth.

2534
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:31,610
Blood clouds my sight.

2535
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:32,590
Is he...

2536
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:33,530
He's the famous doctor.

2537
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:36,030
The fact that he didn't even ask for my permission.

2538
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:37,410
To have a third...

2539
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:40,550
To have a second freeloader living with me.

2540
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:42,310
And thereby stirs the whole-consuming flames of war.

2541
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:46,410
Even if peace lies at the end of his path...

2542
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:48,990
Will it be worth it?

2543
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:49,590
Oh, he's a...

2544
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,910
He's a legendary...

2545
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:52,030
Oh, that's him!

2546
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,750
Still eludes me.

2547
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:54,750
Still...

2548
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:55,910
Liu Bei...

2549
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,510
Is the hero you have chosen.

2550
01:33:58,810 --> 01:33:59,990
And you have decided...

2551
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:03,310
To carry on Juha's dream...

2552
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:04,210
For the future.

2553
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:06,170
So for now...

2554
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:07,350
I'll be watching you.

2555
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:09,510
And hoping that the path you choose...

2556
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:10,130
Fucking most famous...

2557
01:34:10,130 --> 01:34:11,470
Chinese doctor...

2558
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:12,750
But yet still won't pay for rent.

2559
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,590
Will bring peace to our world.

2560
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,680
That's so paced!

2561
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,440
He pays...

2562
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,640
What medical treatment?

2563
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,500
He lights an incense...

2564
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,440
And then I go...

2565
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,040
I go through a bad trip.

2566
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,780
That's his medical treatment for me.

2567
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,400
You have found your path.

2568
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,520
You found comrades to accompany you.

2569
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:21,530
Oh...

2570
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:22,570
My dead wife.

2571
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,630
You're certain to reach it.

2572
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,900
A land of peace.

2573
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:36,420
That's why he doesn't chase after any other woman.

2574
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:40,100
Because no other woman can live up to his dead wife.

2575
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:44,040
That's why he chases ancient Chinese generals.

2576
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,040
Sorry, I ruined the moment.

2577
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:52,120
I'm sorry.

2578
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,640
I'm sorry.

2579
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:54,620
I...

2580
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,460
I might have ruined the moment there.

2581
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:01,660
Um...

2582
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,740
Thank you.

2583
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:03,660
Super chat.

2584
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:04,160
Thank you.

2585
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:04,900
Thank you.

2586
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,900
First general anesthesiologist in China.

2587
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,280
Use my face on.

2588
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:09,800
Thank you.

2589
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:10,420
That's super chat.

2590
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:10,780
Thank you.

2591
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:11,540
Thank you.

2592
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:13,340
Oh my god.

2593
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:15,260
We finally finished.

2594
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,100
It took us four months.

2595
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:20,340
We finally finished Dynasty Warriors.

2596
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,680
Oh my god.

2597
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,780
I heard like...

2598
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:26,700
The other stories would be a lot easier, right?

2599
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,240
Because like they don't scale...

2600
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,340
They don't scale the levels, do they?

2601
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:31,760
Or new game plus.

2602
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,300
But you start back at...

2603
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,360
Level one.

2604
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,260
Oh, but we're finished.

2605
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,640
We finished one story.

2606
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,300
One story.

2607
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,980
On the YouTube channel.

2608
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,140
Oh my god.

2609
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:50,380
I can't believe it.

2610
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,540
You start from your first level.

2611
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:53,540
But do they...

2612
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,840
Do they scale the level?

2613
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:56,960
I can make it...

2614
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:57,900
I'm not scaling it.

2615
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,640
I'm not...

2616
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,620
I'm not...

2617
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:01,560
I'm not...

2618
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:02,300
I'm not redoing.

2619
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:07,100
I'm not scaling the level and making it harder for myself against Lubu.

2620
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:08,300
I...

2621
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,460
I'm not...

2622
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:15,380
I'm not making it harder.

2623
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:15,960
I'm s...

2624
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,380
I'm gonna make sure I one-shot people.

2625
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:23,980
Um...

2626
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:27,540
But yes, the future playthroughs of Dynasty Warriors will be on Twitch now.

2627
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,640
I don't know when on Twitch, but I'll definitely...

2628
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,460
I'll put it on a schedule.

2629
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:33,440
Whenever I play...

2630
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:37,300
I'm gonna take a little break from Dynasty Warriors before we do...

2631
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:37,980
Uh...

2632
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:38,900
Wei or En-Wu.

2633
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:39,620
Um...

2634
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,860
I'm gonna leave Chao Chao's storyline for last.

2635
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:44,120
Just cause I feel like Chao Chao's storyline is like...

2636
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,300
The most important storyline...

2637
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,060
To end it off of.

2638
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,400
Because he's the last kingdom to survive.

2639
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,120
In a way.

2640
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:51,340
Technically...

2641
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:54,200
Technically, Sun Quan's kingdom survived the latest.

2642
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,660
But only because like...

2643
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:57,300
He didn't really do anything...

2644
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:57,980
After that.

2645
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:58,880
Like...

2646
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,780
Cause like...

2647
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:03,280
Chao Chao's kingdom just got taken over by Si Ma Yi.

2648
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:04,860
And then like...

2649
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,560
Like the Red Kingdom just like...

2650
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,480
Existed.

2651
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:09,640
Because nothing really happened for them.

2652
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,640
Um...

2653
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:12,460
But like...

2654
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:13,560
Story-wise...

2655
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,260
Story-wise...

2656
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,320
I think...

2657
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:19,060
It's best to end with Chao Chao.

2658
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:20,260
Um...

2659
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:21,900
Yeah, he won by doing nothing.

2660
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:22,780
Like...

2661
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,640
Yeah, so I'm definitely saving Chao Chao's story at last.

2662
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:29,980
But...

2663
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,180
It was really fun!

2664
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:32,260
Uh...

2665
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:34,140
Sorry, I spoiled a...

2666
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:35,140
How many years ago?

2667
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:35,820
Like...

2668
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,380
500 plus year old story.

2669
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:39,180
For you guys!

2670
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,680
Um...

2671
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:43,580
But...

2672
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:44,500
It was fun!

2673
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:45,780
I'm so happy to play...

2674
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:48,000
Dynasty Warriors with all of you guys.

2675
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:48,680
Um...

2676
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:50,080
Going through the storylines.

2677
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:51,140
Going through...

2678
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:51,620
Um...

2679
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:52,000
Everything.

2680
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,480
Um...

2681
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:53,880
Like...

2682
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,020
Playing...

2683
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,340
The full game.

2684
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,560
And enjoying like...

2685
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:58,380
The history lesson.

2686
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,320
And...

2687
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:00,060
Uh...

2688
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:01,460
Enjoying, you know...

2689
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:02,040
Um...

2690
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:03,020
My favorite characters.

2691
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,040
And you know...

2692
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:07,220
Going to my Dynasty Warriors host club every night.

2693
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,140
Um...

2694
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:09,200
Once a week.

2695
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:10,140
Every night.

2696
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,500
Not this week though.

2697
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,120
Unfortunately.

2698
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,040
I can't believe...

2699
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,740
They closed the host club.

2700
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:16,280
I'm so sad.

2701
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,760
I can't believe it.

2702
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,760
They closed my Dynasty Warriors host club.

2703
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,840
I'm so sad.

2704
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:30,860
They won't let me talk to my favorite Chinese generals.

2705
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,160
I...

2706
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,360
I...

2707
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:38,180
How could they do this to me?

2708
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:39,520
I...

2709
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:44,060
They made me progress the plot.

2710
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,540
I can't believe it.

2711
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:50,860
I have to progress the plot.

2712
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,300
And play...

2713
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:52,440
The...

2714
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:53,680
The side quest.

2715
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,740
Play the mini game.

2716
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:58,640
Instead of the main story line.

2717
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,980
Date of birth and death unknown.

2718
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,620
Officer in service of Lube.

2719
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:08,540
The distinct color of his eyes.

2720
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:11,920
And his radiant sash that resembles the tail feathers of the sacred bird.

2721
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,960
Garnered him the name too long.

2722
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:17,820
He began his journey as a wandering warrior who fought for coin.

2723
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:21,960
However, he became acquainted with Lube.

2724
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,760
During the early days of the volunteer army.

2725
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,280
And after the relationship deepened.

2726
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:28,580
Over time.

2727
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:31,780
He eventually decided to officially serve under Lube.

2728
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:37,240
He feels his feats in the suppression of Yan prophets were especially noteworthy.

2729
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,600
It is said that he defeated 3,997 enemies there.

2730
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,160
Not 4,000.

2731
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:44,620
Wow.

2732
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,940
Wow, Doki.

2733
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,860
I can't believe you're washed now.

2734
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:50,940
Although he was known for his reticent nature.

2735
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:53,100
He got along very well with Guan Yun.

2736
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:55,740
I like how it's specifically named Guan Yun too.

2737
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:59,040
It's said that the two of them trusted each other deeply.

2738
01:40:59,040 --> 01:40:59,540
Ooh.

2739
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:01,080
And Fade to Black.

2740
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,340
And fought together in many battles.

2741
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:09,360
Not Doki's greatest achievement was carved into the islands of history at the Battle of Chibi.

2742
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:16,840
There, he sensed this very unlikely onset of the southern easterly wind that enabled the fire-eye attack to succeed.

2743
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:20,540
Thus contributing to one of the greatest victories ever recorded.

2744
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:24,440
Not Doki was renowned for his stalwart presence on the battlefield.

2745
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:27,960
His guard in battle was as strong as the shell of the divine turtle.

2746
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:30,840
He was terrified called the General of Defense.

2747
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,780
Yet they don't even know when I fucking died.

2748
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:35,540
Like...

2749
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,120
Just like the bare minimum.

2750
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,740
Didn't even bother to ask for my birthday.

2751
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:48,080
Candid, thank you for the super chat.

2752
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:49,200
Thank you, thank you.

2753
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:55,340
Pretty sure in Romance of the Three Kingdom, Hwa Tua tried curing Tau Tau's migraines.

2754
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,720
Which were a brain tumor, probably.

2755
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,120
And we couldn't do it.

2756
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,060
Tau Tau had him executed.

2757
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:04,120
So you probably don't have to support him long.

2758
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:05,140
Yippee!

2759
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:05,980
That's on him!

2760
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:11,080
He's the one that decided to fucking try and help Tau Tau of all people.

2761
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:13,920
Holy fuck.

2762
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:15,340
That's on him.

2763
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,860
We did it!

2764
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:18,620
Oh my god!

2765
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:20,820
We fucking did it, guys!

2766
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:24,100
Oh my god!

2767
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:25,900
I can't believe it!

2768
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:27,880
We actually made it to the end.

2769
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:28,660
Zonderman!

2770
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:29,540
Thank you to the super chat!

2771
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:30,080
Thank you!

2772
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:30,840
Thank you!

2773
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,120
You should totally try it.

2774
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:33,140
Wulong, Fallen Dynasty.

2775
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:34,220
Totally accurate.

2776
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,460
Very dumb.

2777
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,680
Thank you to the super chat!

2778
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:37,240
Thank you!

2779
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:38,120
Thank you!

2780
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:39,920
Oh my god!

2781
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:40,880
We fucking...

2782
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,260
I told you we'd finish it.

2783
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:43,680
You know what?

2784
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,860
We deserve a short stream today.

2785
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:47,140
We had...

2786
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:50,120
Like, Saturday's gonna be a very long day for me.

2787
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,780
And then, uh...

2788
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:52,300
With Fanime...

2789
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:53,380
Fanime...

2790
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:53,400
Fanime...

2791
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,500
And also my sponsor.

2792
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,420
And, um...

2793
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,100
Friday...

2794
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:00,520
Friday, obviously, I'm gonna be raging a lot.

2795
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:02,980
With the Simpsons game.

2796
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:03,920
So, like...

2797
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,180
I deserve this one.

2798
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,900
I deserve this one as my chill game today.

2799
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,240
My chill short stream today.

2800
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,840
And I played, like...

2801
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:12,360
The...

2802
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:13,040
Yesterday and the day before.

2803
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,480
I did a very long...

2804
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:14,940
The...

2805
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,100
Two very long streams.

2806
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:17,540
So...

2807
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:17,960
Oh!

2808
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:19,360
It was a nice day.

2809
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:20,780
Nice day to finish the game.

2810
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,000
I feel like we haven't finished the game in a long time.

2811
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:23,640
So...

2812
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:25,560
Ian!

2813
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,900
Thank you for the super chat!

2814
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:27,220
Thank you!

2815
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:27,760
Thank you!

2816
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,780
Good job, Toki!

2817
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:29,460
Thank you!

2818
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:32,640
Yeah, it's been a long time since we finished the game.

2819
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,520
So, like...

2820
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:34,860
I'm happy with our progress.

2821
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:37,580
I wonder!

2822
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:40,560
We were sort of held hostage for a long time.

2823
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:41,660
But, like...

2824
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:42,900
Um...

2825
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:43,840
But, like...

2826
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,540
I liked it.

2827
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:51,420
I consented to being held hostage by Dynasty Warriors Origins.

2828
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,300
My channel might not have consented.

2829
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:56,720
My channel might have been, like, slowly dying because of it.

2830
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:57,320
But that's okay.

2831
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:02,900
But...

2832
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:04,440
That's okay.

2833
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,940
Because it's over now.

2834
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,220
It's over.

2835
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:11,460
Anyway...

2836
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:12,780
Um...

2837
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,080
But anyway, guys...

2838
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:15,100
Um...

2839
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,100
It was great.

2840
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,260
Completing Dynasty Warriors.

2841
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,500
I had a great time playing, um...

2842
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,420
The Shoe Kingdom storyline for all of you guys.

2843
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:22,280
Now it's time.

2844
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:22,640
You're right.

2845
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,600
Now it's time for Sandland part.

2846
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:26,120
Now it's time to start Yakuza!

2847
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,080
I've been thinking for the super chat.

2848
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:29,400
Thank you.

2849
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:29,900
Thank you.

2850
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:30,840
You're free now.

2851
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,100
Now it's time for Sandland part 2.

2852
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:34,260
Or better yet...

2853
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,980
Let me pull up what's the longest JRPG game out there.

2854
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,540
But thank you everybody for watching.

2855
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,420
I'm gonna head off now.

2856
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,240
Um...

2857
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:46,060
Because like I said...

2858
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:47,280
I'm gonna take this as like...

2859
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,060
A short day today.

2860
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:49,240
Um...

2861
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,460
But thank you all for watching.

2862
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:51,740
I always appreciate it guys.

2863
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:52,640
Hang out with me.

2864
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:53,200
Um...

2865
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:56,140
We finally completed Dynasty Warriors after so long.

2866
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:58,360
So I really appreciate it guys.

2867
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,200
Say goodbye to left side Doki.

2868
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:01,640
Cause she's gonna...

2869
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,800
I'm gonna send her to the farm downstate.

2870
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:04,740
Um...

2871
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:07,800
I'm gonna ship her to America and send her to a farm downstate there.

2872
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:08,480
Uh...

2873
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:08,760
But...

2874
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:09,080
But...

2875
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:09,600
She'll be okay.

2876
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:13,140
I like how I'm talking to myself in third person.

2877
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,080
Um...

2878
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:14,340
Sorry.

2879
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,540
Right side Doki took control of me for a sec.

2880
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,620
But I'll be okay.

2881
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:19,960
Right side Doki said it's a good farm.

2882
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:20,840
Uh...

2883
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:22,100
Right.

2884
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,420
Thank you for the super chat.

2885
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:23,880
Thank you.

2886
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:24,520
Thank you.

2887
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:25,440
Darkblade.

2888
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,460
Thank you for the super chat.

2889
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:26,760
Thank you.

2890
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:27,280
Thank you.

2891
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,640
But since you're a big fan of Warriors games.

2892
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:31,360
What are your thoughts of the Warriors spin-out game?

2893
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,220
Like Zelda, Fire Emblem, Persona?

2894
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:35,080
Um...

2895
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,040
I tried to play the Zelda one.

2896
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:38,120
But like...

2897
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:38,620
I wasn't...

2898
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:40,100
I got really bored of it.

2899
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,320
Because I'm not like...

2900
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:42,080
I think like...

2901
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,860
Hack and Slash is more fun.

2902
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,140
When you are like...

2903
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:47,400
Know the story and the lore behind it.

2904
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:49,740
So I don't really know much about Zelda games.

2905
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:52,140
Because I never grew up with Zelda games at all.

2906
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:52,820
Um...

2907
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:53,000
When I...

2908
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,540
My very first Zelda game I've ever played...

2909
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:56,660
Was the train one.

2910
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:57,460
So...

2911
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,620
I don't know how I keep...

2912
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,040
Getting started into like...

2913
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,780
The worst versions of like...

2914
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:03,340
Certain games.

2915
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:04,440
And so like...

2916
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,100
The train one...

2917
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:07,360
The spirit tracks was my very first Zelda game...

2918
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:07,600
Ever.

2919
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:08,620
Um...

2920
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:09,240
So like...

2921
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,300
And I think that was...

2922
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,720
My only Zelda game...

2923
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:12,660
I've ever played.

2924
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:13,460
So like...

2925
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,440
I didn't understand...

2926
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,500
The lore at all.

2927
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,740
With like...

2928
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:17,500
Zelda...

2929
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,260
Zelda games.

2930
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:19,360
And...

2931
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,000
Why...

2932
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:20,540
I mean like...

2933
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:21,540
The lore is very simple.

2934
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:22,060
Like...

2935
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:23,260
Link gets a sword...

2936
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:25,120
And then he has to defeat Ganondorf.

2937
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:25,800
Like...

2938
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,940
That's basically the lore of everything.

2939
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,840
The general gist of things.

2940
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,560
But like...

2941
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,380
Still I like...

2942
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:32,580
Didn't really have...

2943
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:33,440
Any...

2944
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:34,800
Knowledge of the characters.

2945
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:36,160
Or like...

2946
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,120
I didn't have any like...

2947
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,700
Personal connection with the characters...

2948
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:40,980
Or like knowledge of the characters.

2949
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,660
So like the Zelda...

2950
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:43,960
Warriors one...

2951
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:45,420
Um...

2952
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:46,260
Um...

2953
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:47,280
Was...

2954
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,140
Was like...

2955
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:48,260
You know.

2956
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,740
I don't know who people were...

2957
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:50,540
Other then...

2958
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:51,120
Link...

2959
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:53,560
So I didn't find it that fun.

2960
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:54,160
So I never...

2961
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,060
I only played like...

2962
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:55,720
A little bit.

2963
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:58,760
I never played more after that.

2964
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,400
Um, so I think I've only played the Zelda Warriors.

2965
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:08,060
I think you'd like... you would like the Warriors series and the Hack and Slash series if you know the storyline and the characters.

2966
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,840
So that's like my opinion for it.

2967
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:18,360
So that's why I really like Dynasty Warriors because I grew up with the story and I grew up with the lore behind it and all the Dynasty Warriors games as well.

2968
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:21,220
So that's why I really like... I really like this game in general.

2969
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:26,600
Even when they retell the story like 800 times, I would still play it because I just love the story in general.

2970
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:31,940
And I don't mind... Like, they can retell it so many times, and I'll pay $80.

2971
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:36,200
I enabled them.

2972
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:40,760
You know that Borderlands director was like, yeah, you'll make it work.

2973
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,680
She's talking to me.

2974
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,600
But for Dynasty Warriors, fuck Borderlands.

2975
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:56,140
If the Dynasty Warriors director said that exact same thing to me, I'd buy it.

2976
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:57,680
I'd be like, yeah, I'll buy it.

2977
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:07,400
If it was a Dynasty Warriors director, I'd be like, yeah.

2978
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:18,580
But no, that's really fucked up that the Borderlands director said that.

2979
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,240
That's really fucked up.

2980
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:24,780
It's like, you know, you have phones, right?

2981
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:26,460
Like, it's basically like that.

2982
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:29,100
That's just so tone-deaf of him.

2983
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:31,480
Like, I made it work.

2984
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:33,760
I saved up $80 to buy it.

2985
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,580
Like, you can make it work if you like Borderlands.

2986
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:41,380
But if the Dynasty Warriors director said the exact same thing, I'd be like, you're right.

2987
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:48,220
But because I don't care about Borderlands that much, I'm like, that's fucked up.

2988
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:56,020
Xeon, thank you for the super chat.

2989
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:57,140
Thank you, thank you.

2990
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,140
Spirit Tracks was peak.

2991
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:00,340
You take that back.

2992
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:07,640
I'm pretty sure I have a lot of people in chat that's willing to, like, go on a huge...

2993
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,320
Ready to write a Google Doc about you.

2994
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:11,320
A Google Doki.

2995
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:13,360
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

2996
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:14,500
Thank you, thank you.

2997
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:16,960
We will miss you, left side, Doki.

2998
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,020
Orca, thank you for the super chat.

2999
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:20,000
Thank you, thank you.

3000
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:24,260
Why play Zelda when Link is on the stream I'm watching right now?

3001
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:27,220
Thank you for the super chat.

3002
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:28,340
Thank you, thank you.

3003
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:29,480
All right, guys.

3004
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:30,820
I'm gonna head off now.

3005
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:32,100
As always, everybody.

3006
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:33,340
Stay hydrated.

3007
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,100
Posture check.

3008
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,260
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3009
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,400
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

3010
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,720
Guys, you deserve it.

3011
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,260
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3012
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:42,460
Bye, guys.

3013
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:43,220
Bye.
