1
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,610
Okay, so hey!

2
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,010
Oh, Snuffy's here!

3
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,570
Hey!

4
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,310
Hey, Snuffy.

5
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,110
You're in trouble.

6
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,330
What?

7
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,610
You're in trouble.

8
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,090
Oh, what?

9
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,930
What did I do?

10
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,810
What did I do?

11
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,410
I don't know.

12
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,550
Don't, don't, don't.

13
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,530
It tells me that instead of hanging out with me in real life, you were hanging out with an A.I.

14
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,310
version of me.

15
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,150
Limu, Limu, Limu.

16
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,870
No, nobody could ever replace you.

17
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,130
Oh, yeah, you were asking her if she plays League.

18
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,750
I saw her.

19
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,210
Limu, I'll have you know that somebody, somebody is defaming your name.

20
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,170
They are, they are.

21
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,070
Somebody, I don't, your most popular, like, A.I.

22
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,970
personality is literally just wrote to be, like, admitting how bad you are at video games.

23
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,450
Like, everything you say is just like, I need to be carried.

24
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,330
I am so bad.

25
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,870
I don't even know how to use a controller.

26
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,930
I'm, I'm malicious.

27
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,910
So, yeah, but why are you, why are you hanging out with A.I.

28
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,390
version of her instead of the actual version of her, huh?

29
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,450
It was practice.

30
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,090
I get social anxiety.

31
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,770
If you need me to talk mean about myself to you, Snuffy, I will do, I guess.

32
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:24,890
Oh, no!

33
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,610
Oh, so LabCons gives you social anxiety so you have to talk to a computer version of her?

34
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,390
It's like trying to make a doctor's appointment.

35
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,770
A.I.

36
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,310
friendships.

37
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,150
What if you, what if you, do you like A.I.

38
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:42,590
Laimu?

39
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,910
What if you like her more than real Laimu?

40
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,250
Yeah, yeah, what do you do?

41
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,930
I don't, I don't.

42
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,930
She's a mockery.

43
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,190
I was fighting for my queen's behalf.

44
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,270
Then why didn't you tell her?

45
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,110
Why did you, why did you have to get snitched out?

46
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,970
No, I'm here now.

47
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,110
I'm here to relate to you.

48
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,570
Yeah, but you were late talking to A.I.

49
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,610
Laimu.

50
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,510
I went to pee.

51
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,010
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

52
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,970
I thought the collab started at...

53
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,210
Yeah?

54
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,710
Hold on a fucking second.

55
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,790
Are we doing a collab at 11 p.m.

56
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,330
my time on a Tuesday, which is exactly when the Steam servers die?

57
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,350
Wait, no, don't say that.

58
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,270
No way.

59
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,610
We can play Dress To Impress.

60
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,150
I just disconnected from Steam, so yes, yes, we are.

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,310
Wait, wait, how long?

62
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,230
Oh my God, there's nobody online.

63
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,750
I'm disconnecting from Steam.

64
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,090
I'm stronger.

65
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,770
You guys.

66
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,270
Wait, how long?

67
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,730
How long does it take?

68
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,030
Is it like an hour ahead?

69
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,750
No, it can be, it can be like a little bit.

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,830
And sometimes it takes a while for everyone to like stagger back on, so it could be a little while.

71
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,670
No, don't say that.

72
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,550
I just, I just want to absolve myself.

73
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,810
I didn't pick the time.

74
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,690
I didn't choose the time.

75
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,270
I tried.

76
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,390
I didn't choose the time.

77
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,770
Wait, I was trying to be accommodating to the only EU person here.

78
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,390
I was just trying to be accommodating.

79
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,270
Oh yeah, fuck me for trying to be accommodating to the one person that's across the world.

80
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,230
Like fuck it, I'll never do that again.

81
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,270
I'll make sure to do it in my time.

82
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,670
It starts only, motherfucker.

83
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,150
How was I supposed to know?

84
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,730
I even dressed up and everything.

85
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,870
I took off my skin suit.

86
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,130
Wait, turn, look what I look like.

87
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,630
I even dressed up.

88
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,870
Is he okay?

89
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,570
Are you wearing your uniform?

90
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,610
I have a uniform on.

91
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,450
I even got my little booster box so I can stand up and fit.

92
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,890
How did you work out of doors locked?

93
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,730
Oh no, look at that.

94
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,470
I even got my box.

95
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,410
I even got a...

96
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,810
I can't believe it.

97
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,610
I put a uniform...

98
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,790
I put a uniform on and everything.

99
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,930
And Steam servers are down?

100
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,210
What do you mean?

101
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,830
It's been like 10 minutes or so.

102
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,350
Wait, I think it's back.

103
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,130
It's back, it's back.

104
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,330
It's coming back.

105
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,550
Yes, yes.

106
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,970
How did you guys know?

107
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,650
I have yet to return.

108
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,270
I'm still barred from the horizon.

109
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,910
I got it, I'm stronger.

110
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,490
Wait, are you guys in the multiplayer?

111
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,990
How do you know it's back?

112
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,430
Because my Steam thing says it came back online.

113
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:45,810
See, Snuffy, this is what you get for talking with AI, Snuffy.

114
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,210
This is punishment for...

115
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,370
Well, no, maybe Snuffy actually saved us because otherwise we would have been in the middle of something with the servers down.

116
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,430
That's true, we had to wait for her.

117
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,310
Everyone on my Steam list has been online, like last online 31 days ago.

118
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:01,970
Maybe...

119
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,810
Yeah, it'll do that.

120
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,990
Maybe they were like...

121
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,090
I was unable to sync your fast food simulator prologue save.

122
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,730
Okay, so who's making the lobby?

123
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,190
I don't have any saves, I've never booted it before.

124
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,270
I've never had a save too, so I think you just click on empty, right?

125
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,810
I'm just gonna say fuck you, don't care.

126
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,430
Okay, are we using Lamu's server as well?

127
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,770
The one that's across the ocean?

128
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,030
I'm the only one in Europe, so if you all want terrible ping, go for it.

129
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,070
I'm still imprisoned in the forbidden zone, I'm not connected yet.

130
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,890
It sometimes takes a minute.

131
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,650
Yeah, maybe you log out of Steam and log back in.

132
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:47,430
The other day I was playing Deadlock and it took me like 25 minutes to get back online, and everyone was just sitting there like, we've been online for ages.

133
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,670
I thought nobody played this game.

134
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,070
Oh my god, I closed Steam and I forgot that that's...

135
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,750
Can you up yourself a little bit more?

136
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,730
Oh, you killed all your VTubing stuff?

137
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,510
Yeah, that happens.

138
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,630
I VTubed that way, I did that.

139
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,070
Yeah, I can try.

140
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,070
That's why people are like...

141
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,010
Yeah, I have you at 200%, but you're really quiet on my end.

142
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,370
I don't know why, because I'm in the red on my own screen.

143
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,630
That's weird.

144
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,890
Did you look at your Discord input?

145
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,430
Yeah, everything's maxed.

146
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,310
What the fuck?

147
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,410
That's so weird.

148
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,250
And it's been like with other people's streams too, so I don't know why.

149
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,050
Your Discord's shy.

150
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,570
He's a shy little guy.

151
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,510
I turned myself up a little bit.

152
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:37,510
The problem is, I think it's something with Discord or a compression thing on Discord maybe, because like when you say I've turned myself up, it's literally no difference.

153
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,550
Yeah, me too.

154
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,410
It's no difference, but I wanted to wait for someone else to say it.

155
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,110
Could you like maybe screenshot all of your audio settings?

156
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,530
Yeah, I mean, don't dox yourself.

157
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,610
Don't dox your Discord audio.

158
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,410
Just for laughs.

159
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,230
I'm not sure I could hack you via your Discord settings, but I'm happy to give it a try.

160
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,530
I don't know.

161
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,830
She's been around for a long time on the internet.

162
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,570
Don't trust her.

163
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,330
She knows.

164
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,050
I'm gonna hack you so hard that we'll have to use Ventrilo.

165
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,790
It'll be great.

166
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,170
What the fuck is Ventrilo?

167
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,730
Oh, don't start.

168
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,650
What the fuck is Ventrilo?

169
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,810
Is that an old internet thing?

170
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,830
Yes.

171
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,090
Oh my god, wait, how?

172
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:25,930
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,950
It's like an old voice program that people used to use for things like multiplayer games.

174
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,230
Wait, it's older than TeamSpeak?

175
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,390
Oh, I remember that, yeah.

176
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,630
It was like around the same time as TeamSpeak, I think.

177
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,390
Maybe a little bit older?

178
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,050
I don't know.

179
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,030
Oh my god.

180
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,070
Snuffy should know what it is, because I explained it to her once.

181
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,750
Oh, I thought I was like a Snuffy.

182
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,370
We were integrating it to Dust at the same fucking time.

183
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,150
Yeah, I was gonna say, how does Snuffy know about it too?

184
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,510
Because I mentioned it.

185
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,690
It's 2002, I believe.

186
00:09:59,330 --> 00:09:59,850
2002?!

187
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,230
I didn't start using it in 2002!

188
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,070
I was playing backyard baseball at that time.

189
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,210
What was I doing in 2002?

190
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,550
I was getting hacked in Neopets.

191
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,470
Oh yeah, and getting hacked in Neopets too.

192
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,890
I would have been playing fucking Neopets.

193
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:23,630
I remember when I played Neopets, I didn't have the parental form to access the forums, so I had to ask my parents to give me permission.

194
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,810
Yeah, I did too!

195
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,110
They faxed the permission sheet over!

196
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,770
Yeah, you used to have to get permission if you were under a certain age.

197
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,650
And then, when I was on the forums, I heard about a website called Gaia, and they were like, Gaia's PG-13.

198
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,070
And I was like, I never went on Gaia, because that's where the old people are.

199
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:48,990
Yeah, for the first year that I was using Gaia, I would clear my browsing history afterwards, because it was PG-13 and I thought I'd get in trouble.

200
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,250
So I would clear everything afterwards so my parents couldn't see!

201
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,650
My mom made me add her as a friend, and she would check my profile every day.

202
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,230
And before she'd tuck me into bed, she'd be like, why were you posting this, huh?

203
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,110
What was this about?

204
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,930
Check my history!

205
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,770
My mom was like a bloodhound.

206
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,270
Do you know what my mother used to do?

207
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,850
When I used to take a day off of school because I would tell her I felt sick, I would wait for her to leave, and then I would go use the internet, right?

208
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:28,910
But, we had dial-up, so what she would do is she would wait, and then she would call the house, and if she couldn't get through, she would send me an email being like, what?

209
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,490
She would send you an email!

210
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,670
That's hardcore, that she would send you a fucking email.

211
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,230
And she'd be like, what are you doing on the PC right now?

212
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,050
My parents didn't care.

213
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,130
I think I lied about my age for Neopets.

214
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm pretty sure I did on my second account.

215
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,470
I absolutely did because I didn't want to have to do it again, so I lied.

216
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,050
People lying on the internet, that's crazy.

217
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,330
My parents made my Neopets account.

218
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,930
I literally, that was like the one thing that was like, with your parents' permission.

219
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:09,590
I remember sitting on the floor as my mom made my Neopets account, and she was like, what is your name in Neopets?

220
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,710
And I was like, I don't know!

221
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,870
I wanted to be blue!

222
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,890
Oh my god, did you guys, you guys played Club Penguin, right?

223
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:19,770
Yeah!

224
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,090
No, my little brother did.

225
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,910
Oh, you missed out.

226
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,470
I was roleplaying in Club Penguin as a kid.

227
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,350
Like, roleplaying the pizza, being the waiter, and being like, would you guys like your pizza today?

228
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,150
To all the Club Penguin e-daters!

229
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,010
You were roleplaying having a job?

230
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,330
What do you mean I was a job?

231
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,850
It's like playing with dolls!

232
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,670
But with other people!

233
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,570
Yeah, but they're magical and fantastical.

234
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,510
They're not like, hi, I'm the pizza man.

235
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,750
It was immersive!

236
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,150
That's like a lot of her costumes.

237
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,890
It was immersive!

238
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,130
It was immersive roleplay!

239
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,570
We were in a pizza restaurant, and the restaurant needed a waiter!

240
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,910
I had a relationship with my brother where anything that my brother liked, I automatically disliked.

241
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,870
Okay, okay, I got a little worried there.

242
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

243
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,190
Wait for me to finish the sentence, Doki!

244
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,550
I'm sorry, but the way you started that sentence was...

245
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,230
I have a relationship with my brother?

246
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,270
Yeah, you started it off with that!

247
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:41,990
You could have been like, I have a dynamic with my brother.

248
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,510
I could have said that.

249
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,710
I'm sorry, I'll go back and adjust what I said like 30 fucking seconds ago.

250
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,090
But no, my brother played Club Penguin, and I played Habbo Hotel.

251
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,030
Oh my god, Habbo Hotel.

252
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,710
They're from the pool incident?

253
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,050
Yeah.

254
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,150
You were?

255
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,450
The pool incident.

256
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,850
Yeah, the pool incident.

257
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,070
You should have been there.

258
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,730
I wasn't there, but you should have been there.

259
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,850
What's the pool incident?

260
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,830
What's the pool incident?

261
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,070
It was closed for reasons we don't know.

262
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,630
Yeah, it was closed.

263
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,450
It was just closed.

264
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,110
Do you actually not know?

265
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,890
Why are you laughing?

266
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,710
How can it be so funny?

267
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,690
It was closed.

268
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,290
It's not funny.

269
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,910
It's just old internet.

270
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,050
It's just closed.

271
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,710
I don't want to go into it.

272
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,090
You just had to be there.

273
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,890
You just had to be there.

274
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,290
How about the AI wouldn't have made me feel so bad?

275
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,010
Oh yeah, ask AI Laimo.

276
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,230
Ask AI Laimo what the point of Habbo Hotel.

277
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,570
This is it.

278
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,410
Do it right now, Snuffy.

279
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,570
Do it right now.

280
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,790
Okay, I'll go.

281
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,510
Hold on, let me deafen and talk to AI Laimo.

282
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,330
She's about to lay down the facts.

283
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,010
Wait, is Snuffy actually back online yet?

284
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,430
I don't think Snuffy would get in anyway.

285
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,330
We were trying to wait until Snuffy got back online.

286
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,290
Alright, what does AI Laimo say about the Habbo Hotel?

287
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,170
She's deafened.

288
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,210
She's locking in.

289
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:19,670
She's locking in.

290
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,630
She has to get rid of us to fake me.

291
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,570
What the fuck?

292
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,610
Fake you would tell Snuffy.

293
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,910
She's a real one.

294
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,810
She wouldn't withhold information from her good friend, Snuffy.

295
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,870
She wouldn't keep secrets from her.

296
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,390
I'm so curious if we're in the AI.

297
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,770
Yeah, because it sounded just like you.

298
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,150
That was the freaky part.

299
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,150
That's scary.

300
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,030
It was like characters.ai.

301
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,010
I think that's what it was called.

302
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,070
Oh wait, it said characters.

303
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,830
Sorry, don't type that in the domain.

304
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,590
Because it just takes you to a purchase this.

305
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,230
Okay, characters.ai.

306
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,770
Oh, okay.

307
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,810
Personalize AI for every moment of your day.

308
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,690
Oh my god, they personalize it?

309
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,450
Wait, I'm going to see if it mints in here.

310
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,870
There's Sans.

311
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,990
Of course.

312
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,730
What does Sans sound like?

313
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,350
Wait, you're in here!

314
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,370
What?

315
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,950
There's 45.9k people that chatted with you.

316
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,450
What?

317
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,230
Holy shit.

318
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,370
Stupid bitch doesn't know anything.

319
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,470
What the fuck?

320
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,810
Dude, oh my god.

321
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,230
I didn't try mint yet.

322
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,830
This is weird.

323
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,290
We have 150k people talking to me.

324
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,530
Oh my god.

325
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,670
Doki, you're just so normal.

326
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,690
You're literally so...

327
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,830
You're just like, oh yeah, really?

328
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,170
Okay, that's cool man, thanks.

329
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,550
That's all I say.

330
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,330
Like a non-committal chat on a dating website or something?

331
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,890
You say something super sincere and Doki.ai is just like, okay.

332
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,030
Most of them are parasocial.

333
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,970
But Doki.ai is just like, hey Doki, are you ready for that collab?

334
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,710
And she's like, yeah, I'm really gonna do my best.

335
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,110
Thanks.

336
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,270
Thanks for asking.

337
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,750
Doki.ai is such a normie.

338
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,990
Have you guys seen like the...

339
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,150
You know how like YouTube will sometimes have like ways to respond?

340
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,830
Like the automatic responses to comments or stuff?

341
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:26,450
What?

342
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,470
Like when you're typing an email or something?

343
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,310
Yeah, but it'll be like, someone will be like, great stream today, Mint.

344
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,330
And then it'll be like, you know, it'll give me two options.

345
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,750
That I can like automatically put in.

346
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,070
Thanks for watching!

347
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,070
Yeah, or like something like that.

348
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,850
But recently, they've gotten really advanced.

349
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,830
Like how?

350
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,630
Like there was one that, um, like I was baking cookies on stream.

351
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,310
And I was like, trust the process, you know?

352
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,950
And, and someone commented that, trust the process.

353
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:59,690
And one of the responses that like the AI responses that it was telling me to comment, reply back was saying like, I am the process.

354
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,050
What is this?

355
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,750
I was like, what is this?

356
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,790
I've been screenshotting them because they're so creepy.

357
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,590
I was like, what is this?

358
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,250
My god, it knows you.

359
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,870
It's like reading your microphone too.

360
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,510
It's analyzing your data.

361
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,630
It feels very like in character sometimes too.

362
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,450
So I'm like, this, nobody would know.

363
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,170
If it's me or not.

364
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,730
It's weird.

365
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,790
That's so fucking weird.

366
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,450
Holy shit.

367
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,370
Holy shit.

368
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,610
I wonder what people are using.

369
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,390
Like the thing is they sound like us too.

370
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,290
No, don't wonder that.

371
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,390
There's 150k chats.

372
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,670
There's a hundred.

373
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,530
It must be legit then.

374
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,350
Wait, 820k for Snuffy?

375
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,770
Snuffy, what the?

376
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,730
Wait, oh, she's deafened herself.

377
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,090
She's playing with AI right now.

378
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,110
Wait, she's talking to you.

379
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,630
She's...

380
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,230
You're talking to me.

381
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,630
You're talking to me.

382
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,430
What are you doing?

383
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,950
I clicked the link you put.

384
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,710
What are you doing?

385
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,670
You're talking to her.

386
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,890
I didn't say a word.

387
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,070
I was simply clicking the link.

388
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,010
I followed my friend's recommendations.

389
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,770
She led me into an alleyway.

390
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,770
Lime, I accepted your invite.

391
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,310
And then it was just like downloading the game.

392
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:18,950
What?

393
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,430
Installing the game again.

394
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,890
Why?

395
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,150
Did you take Fast Food Sim?

396
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,570
Or Fast Food Simulator Prologue?

397
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,090
Fast Food Sim doesn't exist though.

398
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,350
Yeah, it's not out yet.

399
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,510
So I did Fast Food Sim Prologue.

400
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,250
I didn't install it too, but I just...

401
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,030
I thought I did download it too.

402
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,990
What's the password?

403
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,190
You have a password.

404
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,550
Oh, I didn't set a password.

405
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,550
Oh wait, you didn't?

406
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,730
It just says, paste a lobby password.

407
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,770
Maybe it has an automatic lobby password.

408
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,290
Yeah, no.

409
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,330
It just let me open it and make it private.

410
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,870
So I can just invite people.

411
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,250
I'm like literally in the thing that says lobby password.

412
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,570
I'm gonna get a cough drop real quick.

413
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,450
I'll be right back.

414
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,670
I'm starting to think this game may not be the most robust thing in the world.

415
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,870
I don't know why I think that.

416
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,170
Hold on.

417
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,010
I'm gonna send you guys some examples of this AI chat.

418
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,690
Or comment responses.

419
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,170
It's so weird.

420
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,830
Like this one.

421
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,090
Someone's just like, nice, new mint outfit.

422
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,370
Oh, I found the lobby password.

423
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,650
I'm wearing a new outfit, whoops.

424
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:33,430
LOL What the fuck?

425
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,350
I got you the password.

426
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,010
I found it.

427
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,150
I'm joining.

428
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,790
Honestly, I'm employee of the month at this point.

429
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,310
Yeah, nobody else bothers showing up.

430
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,110
Except for me.

431
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,090
So technically, I'm employee of the month.

432
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,330
Where's everybody else?

433
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,550
Holy shit, the last time I used the reactive thing, it was for Pico Park.

434
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,550
Where I had to make everyone huge so that they could be showed up.

435
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,770
And so now, I just switched over to my gaming thing.

436
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,190
You guys are gigantic.

437
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,810
You're good, you're good.

438
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,250
No, no, we're waiting until...

439
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,870
My size is set up for that.

440
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,690
Can you send me another invite please?

441
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,730
I will of course send you another invite.

442
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,530
Where's the...

443
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,290
Oh, there's Lime.

444
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,010
I see her.

445
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,710
Hey there, are you ready for a...

446
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,150
I'm just standing in the parking lot by myself.

447
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,910
It's okay, our manager's not here to see us.

448
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,950
Is she gonna do fire us?

449
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,610
Wait, I need this job.

450
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,750
Wait, am I the manager though?

451
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,910
Oh, wait, you're the manager.

452
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,390
Because you have the server, so technically...

453
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,150
You're the manager.

454
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,030
Well, I probably won't fire you.

455
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,150
I don't know about those mint and snuffy people though.

456
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,290
Because they haven't even shown up.

457
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,710
Thank you.

458
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,050
Oh, there it is.

459
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,290
Oh, the lobby password.

460
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,010
Wait, Snuffy, are you back on Steam now?

461
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,790
Yeah, yeah, I'm...

462
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,950
Guys, all my roleplaying as a waiter...

463
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,670
In Club Penguin has led me to this.

464
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,350
This is it, this is it.

465
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,810
So wait, is this just like shopping sim, except it's with a fast food skin?

466
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,070
Yeah, yeah, basically.

467
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,110
It's like TCG...

468
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,750
The TCG simulator, but we're fast food workers now.

469
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,710
Can I order like an obscene amount of stuff...

470
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,970
With all the cardboard boxes outside like I can do in shopping sim?

471
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,290
Because that was funny.

472
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,310
I'm learning the game at the same time as you.

473
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,690
You look like you.

474
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,470
I literally, if my amount of research was...

475
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,410
I click the thing that you send me...

476
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,650
And then I stop paying attention.

477
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,610
Maimou, can you help me?

478
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,570
I have a technical problem.

479
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,170
What's your technical problem?

480
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,950
It tells me that it runs out of memory.

481
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,430
I think maybe I have to tap it somehow.

482
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,070
But it crashed.

483
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,470
I feel like the guy from Buzzfeed.

484
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,130
Go to your NVIDIA control panel.

485
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,330
That's always what I wanted to look like.

486
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,630
Should I tap the FPS there?

487
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:42,450
Yes.

488
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,130
NVIDIA control panel, Snuffy is getting problems.

489
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,930
Are you okay, Snuffy?

490
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,690
That's okay.

491
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,490
It's all of your AI conversations.

492
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,470
We did a good job, everybody!

493
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,810
Yay!

494
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,620
Let's go!

495
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,670
Go to manage 3 settings.

496
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,270
And then go to program settings.

497
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,050
Click add.

498
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,890
And find the executable for this game.

499
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,270
Okay...

500
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,250
Did you end the day?

501
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,170
Was it you?

502
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,270
You ended the day and pressed the card, didn't you?

503
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,890
I fucking know it's you.

504
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,430
Who else would you eliminate next to the car?

505
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:26,930
You know what?

506
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,850
I'm gonna do it again if you're not careful.

507
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,090
We're not gonna make any money!

508
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,370
It's fine.

509
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,350
Once we get working...

510
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,450
The customers will just roll on you.

511
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,190
I'm gonna stand away from the car.

512
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,370
Everybody loves fast food.

513
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,350
Exactly.

514
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,870
Because it's fast.

515
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,870
It's fast.

516
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,050
I'm already in here.

517
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,750
I'm confirming.

518
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,830
Turn on the computer.

519
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,350
Are you not gonna wait for other employees?

520
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,370
This is a system.

521
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,810
This is an established system.

522
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,410
It's 9 AM!

523
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:02,690
Yeah!

524
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,530
But we gotta wait for our fourth employee.

525
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,530
She could be the janitor.

526
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,770
Who's gonna janit?

527
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,610
Okay, I believe in you.

528
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,130
Oh my god, I swear to god.

529
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,830
I closed the restaurant.

530
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,810
You may have to turn down a bunch of settings as well before joining.

531
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,130
If that helps.

532
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,750
Stop opening the restaurant!

533
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,250
Look, somebody's coming!

534
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,130
You're just gonna deny them!

535
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,890
Don't come in!

536
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,130
Don't come in!

537
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,370
We're not open!

538
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,050
We're not open!

539
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,150
No, I don't wanna see him!

540
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,670
I'm not doing anything.

541
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,710
Okay, okay.

542
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,330
No, Snuffy got disconnected.

543
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,190
Oh no.

544
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,710
Have you turned down any of the settings, Snuffy?

545
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,450
I'm gonna do that now, I think.

546
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,010
I just turned everything down to minimum.

547
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,890
Because it might be that some setting has gone out of control...

548
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,210
and is eating your graphics card.

549
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,090
Oh yeah.

550
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,350
Because if you can launch it and get to the menu, turn all that shit down.

551
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,550
Okay.

552
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,290
That's crazy that you're out of video memory.

553
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,830
Like, even if I don't click the cover though...

554
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,810
the time is progressing.

555
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,150
It's now 10.30 in the morning.

556
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,090
It's okay, who cares.

557
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,470
We literally only have one customer, that's okay.

558
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,110
Guys, we have no food.

559
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,450
Oh yeah, I wonder who fucking opened the restaurant...

560
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,470
without making sure we had the food.

561
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,450
I'm just...

562
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,230
I thought we would have food!

563
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,890
Do you want me to order some food?

564
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,990
I think we have to kill this lady.

565
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,810
I'm gonna order some food.

566
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,170
Oh my god, she's waiting.

567
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,930
We have some fresh meat right here.

568
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,550
Oh my god, get her out.

569
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,590
I can't hit her.

570
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,110
There's laws against that.

571
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,650
Why are you trying to sell the customer?

572
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,950
It wasn't my idea.

573
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,630
Oh, go on.

574
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,310
Market application.

575
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,250
Beef patties.

576
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,750
Burger buns.

577
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,570
Someone said this is just like the bear.

578
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,310
The funniest comedy show.

579
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,710
I bought some food.

580
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,570
I watched one episode of the bear and I've never felt so stressed out.

581
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,590
I don't understand how that's comedy of the year.

582
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,990
I agree.

583
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,430
I was so enthralled by it, but I'm also so uncomfortable.

584
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,150
Can I get myself run over by the delivery truck?

585
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,130
Why can't I run?

586
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,190
Oh my god, I'm in here!

587
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,430
Welcome!

588
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,210
I had to turn the graphics on to low.

589
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,070
My apologies.

590
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,470
You can't get hit by the delivery truck.

591
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,670
My apologies.

592
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,710
What do we serve at our establishment?

593
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,690
This seems like a waste of delivery truck space.

594
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,130
Maybe I should've ordered something more.

595
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,030
Alright, are we ready to work?

596
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,510
We gotta grill a beef patty.

597
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,310
Who's grilling?

598
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,930
I'll grill.

599
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,030
I'm just putting the food on the floor.

600
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,630
Can you give enough love to the patty?

601
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,090
This is just like Bob's Burgers.

602
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,070
It is just like Bob's Burgers.

603
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,730
The funny thing is...

604
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,610
Unless we all learn at the same time, the tutorial is gonna fast forward without us and we're gonna get fucked.

605
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,250
It's okay, we each have a job.

606
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,090
Okay, I'm gonna put the patty in the grill.

607
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,450
Hold on, I'm doing it.

608
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,730
Patty on the grill.

609
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,830
Patty on the grill.

610
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,670
Nice.

611
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,050
Wait, I'm gonna make a picture.

612
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,450
Patty on the grill.

613
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:17,850
Alright, nice.

614
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,630
Please don't put all the patties!

615
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,010
How am I supposed to flip all of this at the same time?

616
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,350
Okay.

617
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,750
Alright.

618
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,950
I'll be the grill chef.

619
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,250
I can do the grill.

620
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,290
Dude, we have one customer!

621
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,890
Why did you put two, four, six?

622
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,890
I'll eat them!

623
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,650
Oh my god.

624
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,850
That's not how you make money!

625
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,770
Oh my god, this one's about to burn, Doki!

626
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,890
It's burning!

627
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,090
It's burning!

628
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,470
Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

629
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,930
It's so much darker than the others.

630
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,510
No, it's fine!

631
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,810
It's not even at 100%.

632
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,070
Okay, this one's at 100%.

633
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,170
But other than that, we're fine.

634
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,330
Is she still here?

635
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,230
Everything's fine.

636
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,690
I think our lady left.

637
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,350
I watched her leave, I chased her out.

638
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,090
That's fine, that's fine.

639
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,270
We can pre-make burgers.

640
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,370
Where do I put the burgers that are done?

641
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,190
It says, keep the patties from the griddle using a burger patty tray.

642
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,570
What the fuck is a burger patty container?

643
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,230
Guys, guys, I have the burger done, but I can't put it anywhere!

644
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,610
There's a bun right here!

645
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,290
I can't flip!

646
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,590
I can only flip!

647
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,910
Put it in my hands.

648
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,710
I can only flip!

649
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,690
Someone get the tray!

650
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,070
How do I gesture?

651
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,870
Turn it off, turn it off, turn the stove off!

652
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,070
Someone turn the stove off!

653
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,990
Turn it off?

654
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,630
There's no buttons to turn off, we're here for you.

655
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,610
Okay, okay, this is very done.

656
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,950
Oh, we did it!

657
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,570
Guys, we have a...

658
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,110
This one is undercooked.

659
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,250
This one needs to go back.

660
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,630
No, that's okay, just keep...

661
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,870
It's fine, nobody's gonna complain.

662
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,390
Too much on one end.

663
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,370
Bottom doneness 149%.

664
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,070
That's fine, we are...

665
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,810
Oh, wrapping paper!

666
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,370
We are not a Michelin restaurant, we are literally a fast food joint.

667
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,130
It's fine.

668
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,350
If they expected quality, they wouldn't be here.

669
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,690
Here we are!

670
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,470
Okay.

671
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,710
Guys, we don't have any customers.

672
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,510
We don't have any customers.

673
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,110
It's fine, we're pre-making the burger.

674
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,570
You gotta open it, you gotta open it.

675
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,450
You have to go to the sign, you see in the front?

676
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,250
We're pre-making the burgers at 5pm.

677
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,850
Everybody, we're open for business!

678
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:29,510
Yay!

679
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,730
What's our fast food chain?

680
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,950
Fresh made just now.

681
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,130
You can be the sign flipper, Mint.

682
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:37,770
Oh, yeah!

683
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,830
I'm gonna be like the sign twirler.

684
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,390
Yeah, yeah, just twirl that sign.

685
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,990
Like, look at these burgers.

686
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,650
Gonna put you in a burger outfit.

687
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,430
Can I have a burger outfit, just like the kid from...

688
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,690
Just like a giant burger.

689
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,910
Put it in the wrapping paper and wrap it.

690
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,730
Okay, so Snuffy would be the wrapper.

691
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,210
Do you know how to do it?

692
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,410
I think you're a little confused.

693
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:58,710
Yes.

694
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,070
Wait, what about the bun?

695
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,170
There's no bun!

696
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,070
I just wrapped it!

697
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,890
Guys, what's our restaurant name?

698
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,830
Okay, we gotta figure out a lot of stuff first.

699
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,070
I have to go give this to somebody now.

700
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,050
There's somebody coming in.

701
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,270
There you go, I put the burger together.

702
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,090
Look, see?

703
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,450
I did it.

704
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,430
He's coming up.

705
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,950
I'm gonna take his order.

706
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,710
Hey, what's your order?

707
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,190
He wants one burger in a bun.

708
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,150
I just did that!

709
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,370
I have a bun for him.

710
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,630
This is it right here.

711
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,270
Which one?

712
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,850
This one right here, I pre-made that.

713
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,150
See?

714
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,050
Pre-making burgers is the strat.

715
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,930
Wrapped burger, hold on.

716
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,590
Who the fuck is this?

717
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,690
Did she order?

718
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,910
Put it on a food tray first.

719
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,230
Use the wrapper as a fucking food tray.

720
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,150
I did it, I did it, I made one.

721
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,430
Where the fuck is the food tray?

722
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,430
What do you mean I don't have permission?

723
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,390
What's a food tray?

724
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,230
Oh, here they are, they're down here.

725
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,890
I think we were meant to be...

726
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,050
That person just said hey at me?

727
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:11,950
Fuck off, I'm busy.

728
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,590
This will be fine, this is also a burger.

729
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,110
They put two patties on a burger.

730
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,170
Two patties?

731
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,090
He's so greedy.

732
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,690
Yeah, it's okay.

733
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,830
Okay, wait.

734
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:21,870
Wait, we have one.

735
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,010
Put these two together.

736
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,810
And I made it with love.

737
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,130
Should we maybe be cooking more burgers?

738
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,170
Oh, whoops.

739
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,070
It's okay, they don't know, they don't know.

740
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,730
They don't know, they don't know.

741
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,910
Does anybody know which burger this is?

742
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,350
Is there a way to track?

743
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,510
You think they'll care?

744
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,530
They're literally at a fast food restaurant.

745
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,270
You think they care?

746
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,290
It said minus 100 popularity.

747
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,530
We need another burger stat.

748
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,850
We need another burger stat.

749
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,970
Wait, only Lime can rename the fast food restaurant.

750
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,850
Yeah, it's kind of lame.

751
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,170
Which do I name it?

752
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,450
You're the manager.

753
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,250
How do I name it?

754
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,650
You have to go outside and click the thing.

755
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,830
Wait, we have no meat.

756
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:06,830
Oh, sorry.

757
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,450
Sorry.

758
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,450
Manager, we need meat!

759
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,250
Manager!

760
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:12,950
Manager!

761
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:18,870
I tried to order and it said I can't make another order when there's an order already on the way.

762
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,610
So I think someone maybe actually ordered something.

763
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,250
Wait, who made the order?

764
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,430
I don't know how to order.

765
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,950
What do you want to name the restaurant?

766
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,490
Well, you're the manager, Lime.

767
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:29,870
Yeah.

768
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,310
Yeah, why are you asking us?

769
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,750
We're just minimum wage workers.

770
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,910
Fine, I named it.

771
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:35,690
You deal with that now.

772
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,190
I just gave this lady a hamburger and it said negative 100 popularity.

773
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,130
Okay, I might have...

774
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,090
I might have fucked up the burger.

775
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,570
She didn't even eat it.

776
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,370
She like...

777
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,910
Alright, welcome to Sloppy's.

778
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,950
Welcome to Sloppy's.

779
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,910
Hey, welcome to Sloppy's.

780
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,950
Oh, this guy left a tip.

781
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,390
Oh, wait.

782
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,350
I made the burger.

783
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,610
I should get the tip.

784
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,510
No, no.

785
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,430
What?

786
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,330
I made the burger.

787
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,770
What the fuck did you do?

788
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,570
I took his payment.

789
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,070
This is against workers' rights.

790
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,990
Oh, we already had more burgies.

791
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:14,790
Oops, hold on.

792
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,950
Can you sprint?

793
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:17,970
I don't think I can sprint.

794
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:18,590
It's pissing me off.

795
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,370
I don't think you can.

796
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,130
I don't think we have the energy to.

797
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:22,430
That's dangerous.

798
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,650
That's not OSHA.

799
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,850
It's running in the workplace, everybody.

800
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,250
No running in the workplace.

801
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:27,410
No running in the workplace.

802
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,190
Oh, wrapping paper.

803
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,630
We've got a lot of frozen patties coming in hot.

804
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,550
Here's burger wrapping paper.

805
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,870
Alright, here we go.

806
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,050
Frozen patties on the floor.

807
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,310
Alright, I'm putting the...

808
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,450
the burger wrap right now.

809
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,750
I'm putting it down.

810
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,230
Have we got more wrapping paper?

811
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,790
Is this the freezer?

812
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:50,570
What's in here?

813
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,530
I put so many wrapping paper in.

814
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,330
I'm putting buns right now.

815
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,730
I maybe accidentally ordered like 20 million burgers.

816
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,110
Is 58 degrees a freezer?

817
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,990
Because we just got a whole bunch of orders.

818
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,110
That's fine.

819
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,510
We have $600.

820
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:06,950
How are we going to eat tonight?

821
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,150
What is that in Celsius?

822
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,450
I don't think that's freezing.

823
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,530
Why do we have so many buns?

824
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,730
Because the game didn't let me order.

825
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:17,890
And then it let me order.

826
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,450
I just picked one bun up individually.

827
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,550
Oopsie, I just picked one up individually.

828
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,490
Guys, guys.

829
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,310
Stop flipping the burger!

830
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,880
Okay, alright, okay.

831
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,060
They are 200%.

832
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,040
They are 200%.

833
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,260
We're close.

834
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,480
We're close.

835
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,400
That's fine.

836
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,960
We're done.

837
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,780
That's a waste of meat, guys!

838
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,820
Guys, please!

839
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,360
We reached the end of the day, everybody.

840
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,020
Good job, Janine.

841
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,460
These are like one burger.

842
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,860
Guys, please.

843
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,240
You cannot close the restaurant while your order is still on the way.

844
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,920
Who the fuck is ordering more things?

845
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,480
I don't know!

846
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,380
I'm trying to figure out the baddest situation.

847
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,420
I've done this 200%.

848
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,540
Okay, this was not my fault.

849
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,840
This was not my fault.

850
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,700
Somebody put the fucking...

851
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,960
Oh my god.

852
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,580
Does this look edible to you?

853
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,640
I think there might be a phantom order.

854
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,220
It wasn't...

855
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,260
Hey, don't put this on me!

856
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,420
Guys, we have an issue with our burgers.

857
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,300
Oh, wow.

858
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,320
That looks incredible.

859
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,380
Add it to the list.

860
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,820
There's an order that's stuck because it won't let me close the restaurant because there's an order on the way, but there's not an order on the way.

861
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,280
Oh my god, these burgers!

862
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,720
I stole the top one from the burger before you walked away.

863
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,700
That person is eating an open burger.

864
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,620
This is our famous black bean burger.

865
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,860
Why can't we eat them?

866
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,840
Yeah, this is a black bean burger, duh.

867
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,620
Why can't we fucking leave?

868
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,780
Just let us end the day.

869
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,260
We have to turn the open sign from on to off, guys.

870
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,600
We all have to be near the car.

871
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,680
It says all players must be near the car.

872
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,680
Nobody has ever worked a job before.

873
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,440
Come over to the car.

874
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,460
Guys, I don't want to...

875
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,440
I still don't think it's going to work.

876
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,360
I don't want to go back to this day.

877
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,400
I want to move forward.

878
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,340
Yeah, we got this.

879
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,600
There we go.

880
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,880
You did it!

881
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,160
Guys, I don't think we made any money.

882
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,220
I don't know.

883
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,480
Guys, I'm popular.

884
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,260
We know better now.

885
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,160
Let's go.

886
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,080
One, two, three, get sloppy!

887
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,080
Get sloppy!

888
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,580
Yeah, sloppy!

889
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,140
And we are open for business.

890
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,360
Is the kitchen still the same as it was yesterday?

891
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,500
Yeah, it is.

892
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,040
Alright, alright.

893
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,700
My job is to flip, but don't put all of them on here.

894
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,280
Don't put all of them on here.

895
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,720
I'm going to open the restaurant.

896
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,860
I'll take orders.

897
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,280
Guys, I don't think we have any power to the building.

898
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,940
We're coming in here for the 9.42am burgers.

899
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Okay, okay.

900
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,280
I'm looking, I'm looking.

901
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:14,900
America!

902
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,880
I've got the fresh order.

903
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm flipping, I'm flipping with love.

904
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,800
They would want one.

905
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,180
Okay, we need two burgers.

906
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,640
Two hamburgers required.

907
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,520
Two burgers, two burgers.

908
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,940
Give them to me, I'll deliver the snacks.

909
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,480
I'm still flipping.

910
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,680
You gotta do burgers too.

911
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,300
There's an extra burger there.

912
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,280
There's a whole other grill.

913
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah, there's another grill.

914
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,560
There's another grill.

915
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,680
No, it's not!

916
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:43,960
It's raw!

917
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,020
It's raw!

918
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,780
Don't serve it!

919
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,620
Don't serve it!

920
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:46,900
No!

921
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,180
Can you put the other side back on?

922
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,600
Stop it!

923
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,400
It's a little bit red.

924
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,880
It's not even medium rare!

925
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,180
It's actually rare!

926
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,540
What are you doing?

927
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,060
There's people who are hungry!

928
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,320
There's people who are hungry!

929
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,580
There's people who are hungry!

930
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,120
They don't care if it's raw!

931
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,320
Yes, they do!

932
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,540
We lost our happiness meter!

933
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,560
I think even if they're hungry, they don't want the raw burgies.

934
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,540
Okay, I got good burgers.

935
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,540
I got good patties.

936
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,320
Okay, here we go.

937
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,240
You left half a fucking burger behind.

938
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,880
Don't you dare come near my burgers.

939
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,140
I'm taking the orders.

940
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,020
I feel like this is a competition.

941
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Who will make the best burger?

942
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,860
I know it's not me.

943
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,960
That's for sure.

944
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,140
That's for fucking sure.

945
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,420
Did you get trays out, please?

946
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,360
Who is this for?

947
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,300
This guy over here.

948
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,540
Here you go, burgery.

949
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,240
Did he just squeal like a pig?

950
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,080
You have one bun.

951
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,120
We have a complicated order now, team.

952
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,800
It's hamburger.

953
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,760
Two hamburgers!

954
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,260
I have three patties here!

955
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,080
I need more patties.

956
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,820
Two patties!

957
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,600
That's a single patty, Mint.

958
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,180
Okay, I'll take it over.

959
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,040
I need more patties.

960
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,240
What happened?

961
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,500
Okay, this person liked it.

962
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,840
So I think I got the order right.

963
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,100
This is another single burger, Mint.

964
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,820
I'm gonna just shove it right there for you.

965
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,340
I got more patties.

966
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,920
Okay, this patty is coming right up!

967
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,680
This is the double burger.

968
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,520
The double burger.

969
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,560
Oh, that's the double?

970
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,760
Go give it to Mint.

971
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:40,960
The doubler.

972
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,640
The doubler?

973
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,160
Oh, we're doing it?

974
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,620
Okay, we got the doubler.

975
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,020
There's one more hamburger.

976
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,960
One more hamburger.

977
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,160
Regular hamburger.

978
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,960
Oh, we need...

979
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,120
Hello?

980
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,620
Guys, I don't think I like working in a burger place anymore.

981
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,200
A single hamburger.

982
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,200
Another single hamburger.

983
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,340
You wanted to play this joke!

984
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,900
Yeah, this was your idea!

985
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,140
I wanted to know what it's like.

986
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,200
And now I'm like, hey, this is...

987
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,760
Maybe it's not great being a minimum wage worker.

988
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,300
Don't you want to perfect your craft?

989
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,220
There's too many people.

990
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,800
I can't keep track of what they're getting.

991
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,500
I don't know how to keep track of what they're having!

992
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,300
I don't know!

993
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,280
That's your job!

994
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,370
I don't know!

995
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,490
You have one job!

996
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,930
What is this?

997
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,170
It's a burger.

998
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,770
If you look over here, it says which tables there are.

999
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,010
What did you just hand me?

1000
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,850
It's a burger.

1001
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,570
Everything is all burgers.

1002
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,290
We're only serving burgers.

1003
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,450
We have nothing else.

1004
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,630
All anybody has asked for is a regular burger.

1005
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,990
That's the only...

1006
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,150
They all just say hamburger.

1007
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,390
They don't say if it's a double burger, single burger.

1008
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:57,670
Yes, it does!

1009
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,270
You can tell!

1010
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,690
I'm going to buy more burger wrappers.

1011
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,970
You can't tell!

1012
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,950
Just look at them!

1013
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,110
Just look at them and be like, oh, you ordered the single burger.

1014
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,430
They have faces!

1015
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,070
They have clothes!

1016
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,650
There's like eight of them out there joking.

1017
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,950
This guy ordered a double and now he's angry!

1018
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,930
Oh, I fucked up.

1019
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,850
He literally walked out in disgust.

1020
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,010
Oh my god!

1021
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,030
I fucked up, I ordered so much food.

1022
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,530
I'm fumbling, I'm fumbling.

1023
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,670
You don't want ketchup or anything.

1024
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,130
We have a lot of ketchup.

1025
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,870
That's the best burger making.

1026
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,290
What did you get?

1027
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,290
Everybody wants doubles now!

1028
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,450
No more single burgers!

1029
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,290
We have patties ready!

1030
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,650
Just keep it there, hold it.

1031
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,870
They don't know if it's made two hours ago.

1032
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,570
They can't tell, we can microwave it.

1033
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,810
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1034
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,750
We'll just microwave it to heat it up a little.

1035
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,870
This restaurant is going to be great, guys.

1036
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,330
We're going to do so well.

1037
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,170
I have more patties.

1038
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,230
It's not going anywhere.

1039
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,490
I had a look and the only thing that unlocks at level 10 looked like it was french fries.

1040
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,170
Guys, I have too many patties.

1041
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,270
I need somebody to take this patty.

1042
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:07,930
Okay.

1043
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,850
Wait, what is Lime's job?

1044
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,710
I'm getting some of the fucking truck.

1045
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:16,970
Don't you start pushing me.

1046
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,770
Where are you in the kitchen, Lime?

1047
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,790
I don't see you in the fucking kitchen.

1048
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,390
I just ordered more supplies.

1049
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,370
Oh, yeah, just pressing a couple of buttons.

1050
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,170
Oh, you're doing so much work, Lime.

1051
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,810
You're just pressing a couple of buttons and then that's it.

1052
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,250
Maybe if you fucking applied yourself you could be a manager too.

1053
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,250
Oh, yeah?

1054
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,950
What if I don't want to be a manager?

1055
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,970
What if I don't want to manage?

1056
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,410
The girls are fighting.

1057
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,630
Wait, why are you upset?

1058
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,390
What did I do to you?

1059
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,710
Sir, sir, sir.

1060
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,430
Sir, please.

1061
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:52,990
Sir, don't leave.

1062
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,570
What did you do?

1063
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,670
What did you do?

1064
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,270
Flip burgers, man.

1065
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:01,810
Sloppy style?

1066
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,410
Oh, double burgers?

1067
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,570
I can give him the sloppy specialty.

1068
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,350
I think we took too long.

1069
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,170
Oh, no more doubles.

1070
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:11,990
Only singles.

1071
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,870
Back to hamburgers.

1072
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,310
The only person that's actually doing their job is Snuffy at this point.

1073
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,710
What do you mean?

1074
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,570
I just killed everything off the truck.

1075
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,450
I'm doing my job.

1076
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:26,970
What are you talking about?

1077
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,370
You're doing your job poorly.

1078
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,450
We just leveled up because of me.

1079
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,410
We just leveled up because of me.

1080
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1081
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,810
Bring the order to the customers.

1082
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,050
What a hard job.

1083
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,990
I'm taking the orders too.

1084
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,210
What are you talking about?

1085
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,770
You're just mad you didn't get a raise.

1086
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,450
I'm flipping burgers, making sure it's not roasted.

1087
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,250
Wait, what is this?

1088
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:49,590
A single?

1089
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,310
Single, single, single.

1090
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,350
Single sloppy.

1091
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:53,730
Single sloppy?

1092
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,410
A real fair experience.

1093
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,990
I was just going to say we're really making a real fair announcement.

1094
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:05,250
Sorry, sorry, I can't put it down.

1095
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:05,570
Stop!

1096
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,530
Here's your single sloppy.

1097
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,710
I put it on the table.

1098
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,330
I think we're good, actually.

1099
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,810
Single sloppy!

1100
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,110
Single sloppy, it's on the tray!

1101
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:21,950
Get it on the tray!

1102
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,110
Sometimes their friends spawn out of nowhere.

1103
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,290
Yeah, they do.

1104
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,830
They're eating a burger in front of their friend that gets no food.

1105
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,650
It's almost close in time.

1106
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,530
Is this a single right here?

1107
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,530
One burger, I make one burger.

1108
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:43,790
No, no, no, wait.

1109
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,490
Is this a single right here?

1110
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:46,690
Yeah, it's a single.

1111
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,550
I have four more patties left and then it should be fine, right?

1112
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,210
Guys, we're not...

1113
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,150
Get your feet off the counters.

1114
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,290
Oh god, I'm terrified.

1115
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,690
There's another guy.

1116
00:44:58,830 --> 00:44:59,630
He wants a single.

1117
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,730
What the hell is that?

1118
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,710
There's a single on the thing.

1119
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,030
Get out, I need to flip burgers!

1120
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,390
Ew, what is happening?

1121
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,570
What the fuck is happening over there?

1122
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,650
They're throwing up.

1123
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,150
Wait, they're throwing up?

1124
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,450
What did you serve them?

1125
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,250
No, it's the sound of the burger frothing.

1126
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,270
I don't think we need to put burgers on the thing anymore.

1127
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,310
It's like 9pm.

1128
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,090
Do you think there'll be rats in here?

1129
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,950
By tomorrow?

1130
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,070
There's probably rats already.

1131
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:41,610
We'll put the tray in the fridge.

1132
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,210
In the freezer.

1133
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:44,630
And then we'll put it in the microwave after.

1134
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:47,990
How would they know?

1135
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,010
How would they know?

1136
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,490
The health inspector is just going to come in and close us down?

1137
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,290
They never do that.

1138
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:57,530
Exactly.

1139
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,170
I wish they did.

1140
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,450
I wish they closed us down.

1141
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,450
Are you done with that?

1142
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,950
I need to take it.

1143
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,190
We need to take it, please sir.

1144
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,530
It's not as good as you think it is.

1145
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,090
You cannot just toss the fucking boxes.

1146
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:15,790
Hey, you took my tip.

1147
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:17,410
No I didn't.

1148
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,110
Well, I took the other one.

1149
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,870
I've been working this entire floor.

1150
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:28,250
Oh my god, the day is over.

1151
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:29,390
Thank god.

1152
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,930
Hey, we still need to clean up.

1153
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:31,750
Get your ass back in here.

1154
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,710
What do you mean clean up?

1155
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,050
Everything is already clean.

1156
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,810
Oh, there's voice chat.

1157
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,190
Wait, there is?

1158
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,530
You think they'll like you if we put ketchup on their burger?

1159
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,350
Nah.

1160
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,930
No, they don't ask for ketchup on their burger.

1161
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,670
They're plain Janes, they don't want anything.

1162
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:48,990
They hate fun.

1163
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,150
I hate fun?

1164
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,310
Who comes to a burger joint with nothing?

1165
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,050
Wait, it says level 4 required.

1166
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,990
So we can actually do some more stuff.

1167
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,990
Oh, we get ice cream cups at level 5.

1168
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,230
Oh my god, and the ice cream machine won't be breaking.

1169
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,650
No, please god, no.

1170
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,270
Guys, get out of the dang restaurant.

1171
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,830
My wife is... our favorite show is about to happen.

1172
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,610
I'm cleaning up, there's trash everywhere.

1173
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,710
I'm starting to doubt your commitment to stopping.

1174
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,250
There's trash everywhere.

1175
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:12,670
There's trash everywhere.

1176
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,030
Sometimes it's good to understand.

1177
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,450
Do you want more ice cream?

1178
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,170
You gotta clean up to get the experience.

1179
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,350
We'll clean it up tomorrow.

1180
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,310
Wait, does cleaning up work?

1181
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:25,490
Yeah, actually.

1182
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,790
I'm throwing stuff away and it actually works.

1183
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,450
Wait, does it level us up for doing that?

1184
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:33,810
Yeah, actually.

1185
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:34,650
Wait, it does?

1186
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,490
Yeah.

1187
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,170
Guys, we actually... no, we lost $7.

1188
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,130
Never mind.

1189
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:39,790
What?

1190
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,350
So cleaning up is a scam and we should let it all rot.

1191
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,190
How are we losing money?

1192
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,430
I don't understand.

1193
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:51,750
Do you think the patrons can see us having a party on the table?

1194
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,010
Yeah.

1195
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,310
Let's go.

1196
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:57,090
This place, they're crazy in there.

1197
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,090
Oh my god, we should head over there tomorrow.

1198
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,390
Seems like the workers are having a lot of fun.

1199
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:02,630
Oh, come on.

1200
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:03,790
Wait, what's our restaurant name?

1201
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:04,710
Did we ever make one?

1202
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,150
Sloppy's.

1203
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,590
That's why we kept calling it Sloppy's.

1204
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,910
You think we're just saying Sloppy's for fun?

1205
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,570
It's a very serious name.

1206
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,450
Yeah, this is a serious business.

1207
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,270
The Sloppy's Fast Food Chain.

1208
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,650
It's like the next up and cover.

1209
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,910
Burger King, watch out.

1210
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,930
Yeah, watch out.

1211
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,950
You won't be king no longer.

1212
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:28,950
Okay, sorry.

1213
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,730
Let's leave.

1214
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,030
Alright, I'm ready.

1215
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,610
I'm ready to start another day.

1216
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,730
I love working at Sloppy's.

1217
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,350
My manager does not be here because...

1218
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,110
Sloppy's, Sloppy's, Sloppy's, Sloppy's, Sloppy's.

1219
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,190
I think until we can serve a Sloppy's home.

1220
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,450
Get a fucking car.

1221
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,850
See, we even carpool.

1222
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,170
We're so... oh my god.

1223
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:51,730
I pressed my watch alone.

1224
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,550
We got a barrel of gasoline.

1225
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,550
Oh, we did it.

1226
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,250
We did it.

1227
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,570
Oh my god.

1228
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,470
I love Sloppy's.

1229
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,890
What are we gonna do with gas?

1230
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:06,690
Welcome to Sloppy's.

1231
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,390
Another lovely day working at the Sloppy's.

1232
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,750
What's a Sloppy's fan called?

1233
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,070
Like a sloppy guy.

1234
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,690
I opened it immediately because we don't need that part time.

1235
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,550
Fuck it, let's go.

1236
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,510
The patties are gone.

1237
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,550
The burgies.

1238
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:22,310
No.

1239
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,690
What happened to the patties?

1240
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,670
The rats ate them.

1241
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,650
Oh my god.

1242
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,370
We can't pre-serve patties.

1243
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,850
I can't believe it.

1244
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,810
We do have a rat problem.

1245
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,030
We have a rat problem.

1246
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,450
Customers inbound.

1247
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,510
Everybody take your positions.

1248
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,630
I am organizing my tops and bottoms.

1249
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,870
Guys, we have ketchup now.

1250
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:45,730
Ketchup?

1251
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,410
Please check the orders.

1252
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,950
It's time to do ketchup.

1253
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,150
I need to order ketchup.

1254
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,990
We don't have a ketchup bottle.

1255
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:55,510
We need tomatoes.

1256
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,210
It says fullness.

1257
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:58,270
0 out of 15.

1258
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,490
I got to order ketchup.

1259
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,150
I order ketchup.

1260
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,690
We order tomato.

1261
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:08,050
Why is ketchup so fucking expensive?

1262
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:08,810
Holy shit.

1263
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,310
There we go.

1264
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,370
We made a profit yesterday.

1265
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,710
Where are the burgers?

1266
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,030
I am flipping.

1267
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,750
Let's swap roles.

1268
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:21,950
You do the flipping.

1269
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,850
I haven't even ketchuped yet.

1270
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,450
Let me ketchup.

1271
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,310
Do not put the tops on separate wraps.

1272
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,150
Do not mix your tops and your bottoms.

1273
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:34,910
Order is here.

1274
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,790
Stop it.

1275
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:37,750
Stop.

1276
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:42,590
I don't think we are playing a game anymore.

1277
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:44,530
I know.

1278
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:45,970
This feels too real.

1279
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,130
I don't like it anymore.

1280
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:55,790
I thought we were supposed to escape reality.

1281
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,710
We got a burger.

1282
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,330
I have the ketchup everybody.

1283
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:04,050
Where is the ketchup?

1284
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,490
I just put it in here.

1285
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,350
I will fill the ketchup up.

1286
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,930
What happened to the order?

1287
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,330
Nobody wants ketchup anymore.

1288
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,470
There is a ketchup person now.

1289
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:18,190
We didn't ketchup it.

1290
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,590
There is no ketchup on the burger.

1291
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,810
There are people that don't want ketchup.

1292
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,770
I didn't put a smiley face on the low.

1293
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,290
Which one is the single no ketchup?

1294
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,590
That is the single no ketchup.

1295
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,150
Table number one.

1296
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,250
And then I put a smiley face.

1297
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,110
And then I wrap it with love.

1298
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,490
There we go.

1299
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:40,730
I made a burger with ketchup.

1300
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,710
What is this one?

1301
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,190
This is the Krusty Burger.

1302
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:45,990
Krabby Patty.

1303
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:47,490
No it's not.

1304
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,290
I literally wrapped it with love.

1305
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,910
This person wants three squirts of ketchup on their burger.

1306
00:51:59,050 --> 00:51:59,430
Hold on.

1307
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:01,790
We need more burgers.

1308
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,530
I'm putting as many burgers as possible ma'am.

1309
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:06,630
More ketchup.

1310
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,190
More ketchup.

1311
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,570
Jesus Christ.

1312
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,270
Hold on.

1313
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,130
This is for science.

1314
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,230
This is for science.

1315
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:16,090
Hello?

1316
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:24,170
Do you think anyone wants a burger with 18 dollops of ketchup on it?

1317
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,250
I would.

1318
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,710
Thank you.

1319
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,370
What's wrong with that?

1320
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:29,770
It's so easy.

1321
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,130
What the fuck is wrong with that?

1322
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,830
There is not even a meat on there.

1323
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,150
It's so thick.

1324
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,570
Yeah, it's so thick.

1325
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,410
It's like literally the entire bun.

1326
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,930
This is really bringing back playing Disney Channel.

1327
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,150
Guys, we still have customers.

1328
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,470
My hide-in does look like that.

1329
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,430
What are these right here?

1330
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,450
What is this wrapped bun?

1331
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:52,630
Which one?

1332
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,670
This one is ketchup with three squirts of...

1333
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,570
Sorry, three squirts of ketchup with a burger.

1334
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,230
Which table is that?

1335
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,430
Wait, they took how many squirts?

1336
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,450
They went on the fucking burger?

1337
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,590
Table seven?

1338
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,850
I'm gonna take Mr. Five.

1339
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:09,690
I'm gonna risk it.

1340
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,810
Here you go, table seven.

1341
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,010
I'll have your burger then.

1342
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,010
What the fuck did I do wrong?

1343
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,630
I don't think they wanted three squirts.

1344
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:19,090
I don't think that's it.

1345
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:20,870
It was three squirts!

1346
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,430
It was three squirts!

1347
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,930
You're three squirts!

1348
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,930
Then why is he unhappy?

1349
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:30,570
You need to stop talking jokey and keep flipping.

1350
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,990
I am flipping!

1351
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:33,450
I'm flipping as much as...

1352
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,050
I made three patties.

1353
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,450
A burger with two squirts.

1354
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:40,330
I don't know about you guys, but I'm doing my job well.

1355
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:42,850
We have so many customers, you guys.

1356
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,710
This is a burger with two squirts mint.

1357
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,990
I don't know what this is.

1358
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,090
I don't know what the fuck this is.

1359
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,830
Okay, but this is the two squirter.

1360
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:50,690
Yes.

1361
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,310
I can't put it...

1362
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,550
These are the wrong trays!

1363
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,170
Why are you putting the wrong trays on my counter?

1364
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,330
The two squirter...

1365
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:02,050
Is table number six.

1366
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,550
How many squirts was it again?

1367
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,950
Oh my god, a double, not a triple?

1368
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,070
We can buy soda cups!

1369
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,670
We're gonna have hydration?

1370
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,670
I messed up.

1371
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,970
We can now have a functioning soda system.

1372
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,330
Okay, one squirt with a hamburger.

1373
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,210
I swear to god, if this is wrong...

1374
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,370
If this is wrong, then they are bullshit.

1375
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:33,810
One squirt.

1376
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:34,850
I have patties.

1377
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,090
Okay, this is a single squirt hamburger mint.

1378
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,130
Okay, thank you.

1379
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,590
Single squirt hamburger.

1380
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:43,030
Single squirt hamby.

1381
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:43,850
Oh, sorry.

1382
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,230
There should be some more in the freezer.

1383
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,330
Table 15, single squirt.

1384
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,050
Wait, where are my damn cups?

1385
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:53,750
Hello?

1386
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,810
Hey, where are my cups?

1387
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:57,990
What the hell?

1388
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,910
Hey, where are my cups at?

1389
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,250
Are you sure you ordered cups?

1390
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:03,770
You scammed us.

1391
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,370
Are you sure you ordered cups, Snuffy?

1392
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:08,090
I think I did.

1393
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,030
Did you save the single squirt mint?

1394
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,090
Yeah, I did.

1395
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,310
I'm making another single squirt.

1396
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,310
You guys, anyone that we don't know what it is...

1397
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,130
I'm gonna put it in there.

1398
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:19,890
Single squirt.

1399
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,530
Are you putting burgers in the cupboard?

1400
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,290
I don't know what it is.

1401
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:30,810
Why don't we swap jobs?

1402
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:33,190
I think too much...

1403
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:34,730
Someone just put a hamburger there.

1404
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:38,850
I think thinking too much just isn't your strong suit today.

1405
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:39,530
No, I've been delivering.

1406
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,850
This is table 2.

1407
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:44,790
Table 2, thanks.

1408
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,470
I will save the tables instead of the burgers.

1409
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:52,970
Wait, it tells you exactly what they're ordering right here.

1410
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,270
That's not my job.

1411
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,250
My job is to flip burgers.

1412
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,390
Table 13, thank you.

1413
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:05,410
You're welcome.

1414
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,530
I need more wrappers.

1415
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,910
Where do we have wrappers?

1416
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,030
They're probably not in the fridge.

1417
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,870
There's no one at table 13.

1418
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,230
Guys, I got the load of cups.

1419
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:15,790
I'm looking stupid.

1420
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:16,890
Hold on, let me have a look again.

1421
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,010
Do they have any squirts on it, chat?

1422
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,070
I can't remember.

1423
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:26,950
I've got some.

1424
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,170
I'm making a burger for table 8.

1425
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:35,090
I have some more patties.

1426
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,310
Patties on the tray.

1427
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,410
Soda's live, baby.

1428
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:39,990
Table 8.

1429
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,270
Table 8.

1430
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,550
Okay, thank you.

1431
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,110
Table 8 just left, nevermind.

1432
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,410
Give it to table 11.

1433
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,030
Give it to who?

1434
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,950
Table 11.

1435
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,750
Guys, I overmade some patties again.

1436
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:53,690
I didn't know.

1437
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,410
This is table 12.

1438
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,970
Guys, if we serve faster, we might be able to serve all these.

1439
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,950
I'm working, I'm working.

1440
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,150
We've got another customer.

1441
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,210
Order up.

1442
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:08,970
Order up.

1443
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:10,670
Table 14.

1444
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:11,990
Table 14.

1445
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,530
You can do something that doesn't involve standing there.

1446
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:18,890
Wait, who are you talking to?

1447
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:20,930
I don't even know what I'm doing.

1448
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:25,050
Okay, patties done.

1449
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,350
Double burger, double burger, double burger.

1450
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:29,230
All patties are done.

1451
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:30,830
We don't want to waste inventory.

1452
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:32,730
Table 4.

1453
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:33,690
Okay.

1454
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,010
I can help, I can help.

1455
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,310
We have table 4 left.

1456
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:39,630
Table 4 is the last order.

1457
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:40,990
Table 4 is done.

1458
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:41,830
We're done, we're done.

1459
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:43,490
We have another customer.

1460
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,250
What do they want?

1461
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:47,630
Burger?

1462
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,690
They need one hamburger.

1463
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,050
Hold on.

1464
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,710
No need to put any ketchup.

1465
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,110
I can't believe it.

1466
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,030
Bitch, fuck, shit.

1467
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,290
That's dumb, I hate that one.

1468
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,010
That one's dumb, I didn't like it anyway.

1469
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:04,410
I'm going to put this into the freezer.

1470
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,610
Jack, we don't have any money.

1471
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,270
No, I'm getting tips, don't worry.

1472
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:09,770
That's not true.

1473
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:11,430
Table 9.

1474
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:14,650
Oh shit, I have patties, I have patties.

1475
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:15,490
I put it in the freezer.

1476
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,350
I wasn't sure we had more orders.

1477
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:20,810
I think we're good.

1478
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,690
I think we're good.

1479
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,490
That was the last one.

1480
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,390
There's another, oh yeah.

1481
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:27,750
I'm hoarding all the tips.

1482
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:31,370
I'm going to put this in the fridge and see if that keeps it again.

1483
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,090
Can I just toss stuff in the fucking trash?

1484
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:36,490
Hold on.

1485
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,610
We were actually making profit!

1486
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,370
I got an achievement for throwing shit away.

1487
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,810
Yeah, you do.

1488
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,050
I've thrown a lot of burgers away.

1489
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,810
Come on, eat your burger.

1490
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:50,610
Eat your burger, come on.

1491
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:51,890
I want tips.

1492
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,730
You scared me, I thought you were like...

1493
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,910
I thought you were like...

1494
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,830
What's that guy from It?

1495
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,390
I love how someone is with them and they just awkwardly stare at them the entire time.

1496
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,350
Come on, I want my tip.

1497
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,350
I worked so hard flipping on the grill.

1498
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,750
There were two tips that you just ignored right behind you.

1499
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:10,150
Wait, what?

1500
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:11,790
Are they on the table?

1501
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,650
Okay, but I know these guys are going to tip so much.

1502
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:14,670
That's cool.

1503
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,110
I know it.

1504
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,110
Wait, where did the tip go?

1505
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:25,010
Where did the tip go?

1506
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,310
Where did the tip go?

1507
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,670
Where did the tip go?

1508
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,130
Okay.

1509
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:37,090
Oh wait, you guys, we have bathrooms.

1510
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:38,370
Should we be cleaning these?

1511
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,830
I don't think it matters.

1512
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:41,110
I like your stash, Mint.

1513
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,390
Wait, why do you have a stash?

1514
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,270
Did you stash burgers in there when you don't know what they are?

1515
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,070
You're sitting underneath the ice cream machine.

1516
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,010
I didn't know what burger that was.

1517
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,870
I didn't know.

1518
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:53,090
You just stashed it when you don't know what the burgers are.

1519
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,430
Is that the plan?

1520
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:57,330
Yeah, I don't know what to do with them.

1521
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,470
Wait, Snuffy is making soda.

1522
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,430
It's splash cola.

1523
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:03,790
Do you know how to put a lid on it?

1524
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,950
Do you think it's supposed to be served just like that?

1525
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:06,950
It's for the rats.

1526
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,670
If you like it then you better put a lid on it.

1527
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:09,830
I think you just put...

1528
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,790
Maybe, I don't know.

1529
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:12,750
Put a lid on it.

1530
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,490
Wait, is it getting colder or warmer?

1531
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,570
Oh, no, it's getting warmer.

1532
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:18,370
Oh, this actually has like temperature.

1533
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,290
You can actually serve warm soda on it.

1534
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:24,770
Ew, people are going to get mad if they have warm soda.

1535
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:26,830
Yeah, it's literally getting warmer.

1536
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:28,910
Okay, kids.

1537
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,190
Dad's going home.

1538
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:31,870
Carpool time, everybody.

1539
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:33,150
Carpool time.

1540
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:37,690
I like how there's a tray that's permanently highlighted underneath the desk there.

1541
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:38,770
I don't know if everyone sees it.

1542
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:39,710
Wait, I don't see it.

1543
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,350
I think that's a manager thing.

1544
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:45,450
I think that must be the secret drug stash.

1545
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:48,350
Let's go!

1546
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,490
Did we make money?

1547
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:50,950
Did we make money, dad?

1548
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:52,270
We did!

1549
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:53,850
$27!

1550
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:58,710
I'm starting to think we're not very efficient with our food purchasing.

1551
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,110
No, no, no, no.

1552
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,350
$27, we did it, guys.

1553
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:03,890
We finally...

1554
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,330
We can make soda now.

1555
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:05,810
Soda!

1556
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:12,550
All I'm saying is that when you start a restaurant, you take a loss and then you start making a profit.

1557
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:17,410
Maybe we grill a little bit first so that we don't have the first five customers storm away.

1558
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:19,490
We can almost sell a combo meal.

1559
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:22,090
Let us grill slightly first.

1560
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:23,130
Okay, guys.

1561
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:25,510
It's already on.

1562
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,070
It's already on.

1563
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:27,890
Wait, wait, wait.

1564
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,090
Who turned the business on?

1565
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:30,690
I didn't.

1566
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,130
Who turned it on?

1567
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,970
I'm ready for customers.

1568
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:36,770
I'm ready for customers.

1569
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,970
I'm grilling.

1570
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,990
I'm double dashing.

1571
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,870
I don't know.

1572
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:43,970
Is this only for fries?

1573
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,930
I think it's for fries.

1574
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,670
Customers inbound!

1575
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:50,130
We have two people already!

1576
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,370
Customers inbound!

1577
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:54,290
I need a burger tray for the burger flipper!

1578
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,630
I'm taking inventory.

1579
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:56,930
Where's the burger tray?

1580
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,010
We have a drink!

1581
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:00,170
Our first drink order!

1582
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:01,710
Just a drink?

1583
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:02,410
Oh, thank God.

1584
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:03,490
I don't have...

1585
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:04,670
Wait, what do they want?

1586
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,030
Splash cola.

1587
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,390
Okay, I'm putting more patties in.

1588
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:10,570
I'm putting more patties in.

1589
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,890
The burger flipper is doing the burger flipping.

1590
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:14,850
Oh, whoops.

1591
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:16,570
Is it almost ready?

1592
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:18,470
We have two burgers already we need.

1593
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,870
How do I get the lid?

1594
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,310
Miss Manager, when do we get our promotions?

1595
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:25,430
Guys, we still don't have any money.

1596
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,350
Oh, shoot.

1597
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:27,610
So...

1598
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,450
We can't buy any more burgers.

1599
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,150
We have $700!

1600
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:33,690
You're just not allowed to buy anything.

1601
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:35,670
Wait, how can we not have that?

1602
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:37,050
I bought stuff before.

1603
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,630
Is it like player unique?

1604
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:42,550
The top rate is the cost, not the money we have.

1605
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:46,630
What's the one under it then?

1606
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,010
I'm gonna let you wait for a second.

1607
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,550
Guys, I don't think we're learning.

1608
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,150
Table 11!

1609
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,190
Table 11!

1610
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,790
I got patties!

1611
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:57,350
Patties here!

1612
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:59,230
Table 11!

1613
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:00,430
Table 11!

1614
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:03,230
This is for table 6 to go with the cola.

1615
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,630
Table 6 to go with the cola!

1616
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:10,230
Oh, time to get lettuce!

1617
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,310
We're doing so well, guys!

1618
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:14,710
This is for table 2.

1619
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:16,650
Table 2!

1620
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:18,650
Table 2!

1621
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:19,830
Let me take a couple of orders.

1622
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,330
You can take them.

1623
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:24,970
Table's on the table!

1624
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:27,350
Patties on the table!

1625
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:30,510
We're losing our minds!

1626
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:34,170
That's my job!

1627
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:37,870
I have no other purpose but to flip patties!

1628
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,690
This is for table 1, but they need a cola.

1629
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:45,530
Oh, they have a cola.

1630
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,830
Yeah.

1631
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:49,650
Where are my wrappers?

1632
01:03:50,350 --> 01:03:51,470
I need my wrappers.

1633
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:54,070
I don't think we have wrappers anymore.

1634
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,330
We've got tons of wrappers in the store.

1635
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:57,950
One moment, ma'am.

1636
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,590
We do not need to buy more wrappers, Nuffy.

1637
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:00,470
Just so you know.

1638
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:02,510
Ketchup.

1639
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:05,470
I bought lettuce.

1640
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,270
I'm flipping more patties!

1641
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,970
We're about to be able to advertise ourselves as vegan!

1642
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:13,270
Table 12!

1643
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:17,750
Table 12.

1644
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:19,330
Oh, no!

1645
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:20,950
I think I did the wrong thing.

1646
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:22,490
Oh, dear.

1647
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,090
Alright, here he comes.

1648
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:25,990
Lettuce drop!

1649
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:26,670
Lettuce drop!

1650
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:27,390
World update!

1651
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:28,150
Regular.

1652
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:33,550
We're gonna be able to make the burgers a little healthier!

1653
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:37,210
They're certainly going to be colorful.

1654
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,050
Table 16!

1655
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,670
Lettuce delivery!

1656
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,330
What's table 16 got?

1657
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,490
Do you need to chop the lettuce?

1658
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:45,730
I'm not sure.

1659
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:47,670
Table 3.

1660
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,910
Alright, I have a lot of patties.

1661
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,270
I'm going to stop grilling, because I don't want to waste inventory.

1662
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:57,150
We literally have the Burger King foot lettuce!

1663
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:00,130
Did you serve that burger?

1664
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:01,610
To who?

1665
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,390
That burger had listeria in it.

1666
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,470
This is for table 3.

1667
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,170
Table 3!

1668
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,510
Bails, I need a drink, though.

1669
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:13,930
Yeah, I know.

1670
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:15,290
I'm getting the burgers in.

1671
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:16,770
I'm getting the patty in.

1672
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:17,530
Mr. Hoop.

1673
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:18,690
I can't read these.

1674
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:18,930
Okay.

1675
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,030
Table 5.

1676
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,390
We're a well-working machine now!

1677
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,630
Look at us go!

1678
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,630
I'm so proud of us!

1679
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:30,070
How do I...

1680
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,010
Table 10.

1681
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:33,810
What do we do with the lettuce?

1682
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:35,910
How do we make lettuce?

1683
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,190
Hold on.

1684
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:38,130
Hold on.

1685
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:39,410
How do we make lettuce happen?

1686
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:40,950
How do we make lettuce happen?

1687
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,470
Usually, you would put it into an ingredient tray.

1688
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:46,010
As it is an ingredient...

1689
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:46,230
Oh!

1690
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:47,950
Alright, guys.

1691
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,570
You know what to do now.

1692
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:53,810
Shred it.

1693
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,510
Shred it up.

1694
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:58,690
I think Mint might need some help with the drinks and stuff up front.

1695
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,530
I need help with the drinks!

1696
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,150
You'll be fine!

1697
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,130
Alright, guys.

1698
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,610
You know what to do.

1699
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,690
They just want water!

1700
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:09,810
You can get that yourself!

1701
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:11,190
Okay, okay, okay.

1702
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,150
I'll help you.

1703
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:14,290
Did you just tell the customer to get their own food?

1704
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:17,530
Why is the drinking even on our side?

1705
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:18,970
It should be like that!

1706
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:19,650
We have water!

1707
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,090
Table 17!

1708
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,050
Who wanted water?

1709
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,190
Oh, I think they walked out.

1710
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,350
Table 17?

1711
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:34,250
No, the people that wanted the water.

1712
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,450
Oh, okay.

1713
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:36,510
Table 4.

1714
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,470
Oh my god, what do I do?

1715
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,470
Manager, I did my job!

1716
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:42,770
What else do I do?

1717
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,510
What's everybody doing?

1718
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:47,690
Table 17!

1719
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:49,030
Help Mint, she's having a mental breakdown.

1720
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,310
Mint, what do you need?

1721
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:52,430
Table 4!

1722
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:54,970
Mint, what do you need?

1723
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:55,790
Say something!

1724
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,090
We're here to help you!

1725
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:00,550
This is to table...

1726
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:01,170
17.

1727
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,610
Alright, table 17.

1728
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:04,190
We're 17.

1729
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,730
Oh, it's over there, okay.

1730
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:07,830
Yeah, yeah.

1731
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,630
I'm here to serve you because our waiter is incompetent.

1732
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:16,490
What have you been doing this whole time?

1733
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:20,610
Besides flipping burgers, I've been taking orders, I've been delivering orders, I've been clearing tables...

1734
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:22,350
People are leaving!

1735
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,450
Yeah, and people are leaving.

1736
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,410
What is this burger right here?

1737
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:29,710
What is this one?

1738
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:34,790
Do you think table 10 is going to stay long enough for me to serve them?

1739
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:40,690
Table 10 has been waiting here for an hour.

1740
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:42,950
Did you see that?

1741
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:43,910
Did you see that?

1742
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,850
Table 10, table 10!

1743
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:46,650
That's a burger!

1744
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:47,970
Take it to table 10!

1745
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,450
I'm almost out of cups, by the way!

1746
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:52,470
There's cups to your right!

1747
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,270
There's actual cups to your right side!

1748
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,170
There's 10 here!

1749
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57,170
Okay, bring them over here.

1750
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,810
Wait, which is this burger for?

1751
01:07:58,890 --> 01:07:59,370
Table 10?

1752
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:00,670
Table 10, table 10!

1753
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:03,670
Uh, table 7.

1754
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:05,150
Alright, I'll bring it over.

1755
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,670
I'll bring it over to table 10.

1756
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,210
Table 7, splash code.

1757
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,590
This is table 7!

1758
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:12,950
Oh, nice!

1759
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:17,590
Mint, do you need to go to the cooler to cool off?

1760
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:21,150
Yeah, I'm going to go cry in there.

1761
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:28,450
I've heard that crying in the walk-in freezer is a rite of passage.

1762
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:30,310
It is, actually, though.

1763
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:30,890
What?

1764
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:32,570
Oh, 7!

1765
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:34,090
Wait, why did you leave?

1766
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:36,270
Okay, table 7 left.

1767
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:38,750
Why do they keep leaving when you're...

1768
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,150
Because they've been here for two and a half hours for a burger.

1769
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:46,550
Look, I finished making all my burgers.

1770
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:48,770
Oh, we don't have any patties left.

1771
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:49,670
This lady just wants a Yoma.

1772
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:51,910
What the fuck is a Yoma?

1773
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:53,410
It's like soda.

1774
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,030
Table 4!

1775
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,930
Hey guys, um...

1776
01:08:56,930 --> 01:08:57,550
We have an issue.

1777
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:00,870
We need more patties.

1778
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:06,630
We have one more box.

1779
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:07,110
Oh, wait.

1780
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,130
Can you put that to the fridge next to me?

1781
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:11,770
Uh, yeah.

1782
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,830
Oh my gosh, I'm out of cups!

1783
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:19,970
I'm flipping patties.

1784
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,510
We don't have patties right now.

1785
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:24,210
Someone take this to table 4!

1786
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:27,830
Oh god.

1787
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,310
I need to order more patties and more food.

1788
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,230
You want more cups?

1789
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,090
More cups.

1790
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,190
Okay, I ordered cups.

1791
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:39,510
Why is it so fucking expensive?

1792
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:42,150
Oh no, oh no.

1793
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:44,490
Now we're wasting more patties.

1794
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:45,990
Because it's 9!

1795
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,150
And I didn't know it was 9 already!

1796
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,910
Now we're still getting orders.

1797
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,470
How are we still getting orders?

1798
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:54,690
We have people coming in!

1799
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,150
What's this random wrapped burger?

1800
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:59,110
I don't know, it was one that they left.

1801
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,350
I'm gonna put it in the sink or something.

1802
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,550
No, put it under the cabinet!

1803
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:04,670
Apologies, apologies.

1804
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:05,490
It's too late.

1805
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,330
It's gone.

1806
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,790
We could've ate that burger!

1807
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:10,830
The stash!

1808
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:15,870
Okay, I have more patties.

1809
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:16,950
This is table 7!

1810
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,370
This one's a little bit overdone though.

1811
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:19,690
Table 7!

1812
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:21,650
Just a little bit.

1813
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:23,170
I'm taking this lady's order.

1814
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,230
Don't fire me!

1815
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,290
I'm doing my job!

1816
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:29,670
I'm doing the best I can!

1817
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:31,010
Nobody's getting fired!

1818
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:34,550
I'm doing the best I can!

1819
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:35,430
I'm getting fired!

1820
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:37,230
Nobody's getting fired!

1821
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:43,150
I'm gonna start shrinking!

1822
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:44,930
I need this job!

1823
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,010
We're gonna start cutting costs.

1824
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:50,070
What was at table 7?

1825
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:51,250
Oh my god, they just left.

1826
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:52,830
Table 11!

1827
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:55,410
Table 11!

1828
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:58,150
Wait, which one is table 11?

1829
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:58,770
Which one?

1830
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,210
This one!

1831
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:04,750
I hope your job is considered essential.

1832
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:04,770
I hope your job is considered essential.

1833
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:14,950
I'd like to report that in a week...

1834
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:16,010
Wait, who's banging on the door?

1835
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:20,770
In a week of working at the restaurant, we are negative $250.

1836
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:22,130
Good job, everybody!

1837
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,970
Somebody's banging on the door.

1838
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,910
What?

1839
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,770
Is somebody stuck in the freezer?

1840
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,550
Is somebody stuck in the freezer?

1841
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:34,410
Is somebody stuck in the freezer?

1842
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,330
I am locked in the freezer!

1843
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,810
Do you think she'll cool off?

1844
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:41,430
Do you think she needs a minute to cool off?

1845
01:11:41,450 --> 01:11:42,510
I was able to leave!

1846
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,310
Try going in!

1847
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,350
Mint's character looks so fucking tired.

1848
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:57,710
I'm dead inside right now.

1849
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:01,350
Get me out!

1850
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,190
You can't end this game without me!

1851
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,590
It's the end of the day.

1852
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:10,730
You'll be living on day 4 for the rest of your life if you don't let me out.

1853
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,430
Let me out!

1854
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:16,550
You're the only one with a wife, I'm pretty sure, so I don't care.

1855
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,570
Let me out!

1856
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:20,050
Please!

1857
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:23,410
Please!

1858
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,450
You sound so pathetic!

1859
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:30,650
This is all I have in my life!

1860
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,910
Familiarize yourself with the patties.

1861
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:35,470
Your technique is shabby.

1862
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:36,410
There's not even no patties!

1863
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:39,250
There's like no food left in the freezer, guys!

1864
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,350
There's nothing left!

1865
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:42,310
No patties and no life.

1866
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:44,290
There's no reason to live.

1867
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:47,550
What is all the fucking food we bought in this cupboard?

1868
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:52,510
I feel like the episode of Spongebob where they have a bunch of the diapers.

1869
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,210
It's the unknowns!

1870
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:58,550
That's what these are!

1871
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:59,810
They're the unknowns!

1872
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,630
Guys, please!

1873
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:09,210
I wanna go home to my family!

1874
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:11,690
Are you still in the freezer?

1875
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:12,790
Yes I am!

1876
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:14,250
Open the door!

1877
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:20,650
I can't even open the door!

1878
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,270
Why are people still ordering food?

1879
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,490
What is the purpose of your existence?

1880
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:27,830
We need it for tomorrow!

1881
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,170
I work the night shift!

1882
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,390
I have no patties!

1883
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,230
I have no patties!

1884
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:38,530
We already lost a hundred dollars!

1885
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:42,810
We gotta make sure we're stocked up for the start tomorrow!

1886
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:45,970
Alright, let's clock out, gang!

1887
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:47,550
Alright, clock out, gang!

1888
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,050
Lock up first, too, you know?

1889
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,390
I love...

1890
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:54,370
I love...

1891
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,310
I love working here every day.

1892
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,050
I thought it'd be a fun...

1893
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:07,450
I thought it'd be a fun experience.

1894
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:12,130
I mean, please...

1895
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:13,410
I just wanna...

1896
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:15,290
I wanna start the new day.

1897
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:24,150
Imagine how exciting waking up it'll be knowing that tomorrow is the day that we might be able to start serving french fries.

1898
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:26,950
I'm excited.

1899
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,390
As a sloppy team member, I'm excited.

1900
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:30,910
I'm excited.

1901
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:31,870
I love sloppies!

1902
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:32,830
I love sloppies!

1903
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:33,890
I love sloppies!

1904
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:36,110
Yay!

1905
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:46,270
I'm Little Bites now.

1906
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:49,590
I'm afraid of when we get the drive-thru.

1907
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:54,010
Wait, we get the drive-thru?

1908
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:56,990
I don't think we have enough people for the drive-thru.

1909
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:01,510
I don't think we have enough...

1910
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:02,190
9am!

1911
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:04,170
You guys wanna start grilling?

1912
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:06,170
We just started grilling.

1913
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,070
Please let me grill just a little.

1914
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,330
Do we have any more cups?

1915
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:12,590
Or is this it?

1916
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:18,230
You would blow your mind, but open that door and you shall see I have filled your cup dreams.

1917
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:18,810
Wow!

1918
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,530
You really did!

1919
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,630
Snuffy is so good.

1920
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:23,950
Maybe she should be the manager.

1921
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,310
She knows how to restock.

1922
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,050
All in favor of changing manager, say aye.

1923
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:28,830
Aye!

1924
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:29,010
Aye!

1925
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:32,750
I didn't mean to overthrow anybody.

1926
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,230
I just love working with sloppies!

1927
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,870
I just feel like...

1928
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:40,010
Snuffy has the sloppy spirit.

1929
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:42,730
Yeah, she has more sloppy spirit than all of us.

1930
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,030
She represents the sloppiness.

1931
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:46,910
If I'm restocking, I get yelled at for doing nothing.

1932
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:49,450
If I'm doing the burgers, I get yelled at for not restocking.

1933
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,490
Mute me at sloppies!

1934
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:54,430
Mute me at sloppies!

1935
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,650
Then we get the sloppy bonus.

1936
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,590
Yeah!

1937
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,830
I don't know if I want a sloppy bonus.

1938
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:06,630
All I'm saying is that I think Snuffy represents the sloppy values.

1939
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,290
And she never complained.

1940
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,130
I don't know if you should be calling Snuffy sloppy.

1941
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:16,650
She has the sloppy charisma.

1942
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:19,890
Yeah!

1943
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,410
Grab your family so we can all get sloppy together.

1944
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:28,850
I'm honestly a little bit concerned that you think that sloppies is a democracy.

1945
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:35,630
I'm just going to throw it out here.

1946
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:40,150
Who made you the boss of all sloppies?

1947
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:41,110
It's the matriarchy.

1948
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:43,370
It's my fucking server!

1949
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,430
Wait, did we get froyo?

1950
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:46,490
What the hell is this?

1951
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,910
We unlocked ice cream?

1952
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:51,410
Do we have purple cups?

1953
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:55,050
We're about to have purple cups.

1954
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,450
Oh my god, we're going to have purple cups?

1955
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:00,170
We're going to make sloppy cream?

1956
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:02,210
We're going to make sloppy cream.

1957
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:08,690
Ice cream!

1958
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:09,250
Ice cream!

1959
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:13,290
The cups are here.

1960
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:16,970
Okay, I'm going to need help.

1961
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:19,870
I can't do drinks and cups and serving and orders and everything.

1962
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:21,470
I'll help you with the front end.

1963
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,930
The kitchen is fine.

1964
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:25,910
The kitchen is sloppy.

1965
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,770
This is for table number two.

1966
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:30,630
Okay, I'm flipping.

1967
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,670
How do you do lettuce in a burger?

1968
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:35,730
I haven't done that yet.

1969
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,700
Here's some ice cream.

1970
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:40,830
Wait, do we have ice cream now?

1971
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,530
Yeah, we have ice cream.

1972
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:43,510
Do we have lettuce?

1973
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:44,470
Where the fuck is the lettuce?

1974
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:46,690
There's so many food!

1975
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:47,410
How are we going to order?

1976
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,850
How are we going to keep up, gang?

1977
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,450
We need water?

1978
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:55,710
What do you mean we need water?

1979
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:57,310
Why are cars beeping?

1980
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:59,070
Wait, do we have drive-thru?

1981
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:01,770
No, I don't think.

1982
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:03,150
Wait, why is the window open?

1983
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,130
It was getting hot in here.

1984
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:06,910
Oh, okay.

1985
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:08,890
This is for table number three!

1986
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:12,310
Wait, table number two's burger is still here!

1987
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:14,010
This is two.

1988
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:14,110
Two.

1989
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:16,070
Three.

1990
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,150
Order up!

1991
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:21,250
I got more patties!

1992
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:23,630
No, no.

1993
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,150
Wait, let me make it vanilla.

1994
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:28,210
And then take it to table number two.

1995
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,290
They want some ice cream.

1996
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:32,150
She just left.

1997
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:32,930
I threw it in the garbage.

1998
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,870
No, we kept it for the next order!

1999
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:38,210
It's not melting or anything, right?

2000
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:42,330
Wait, I'm confused about what I ordered.

2001
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:43,690
Oh, no.

2002
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:45,550
This is for table number sixteen!

2003
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:47,230
Table sixteen!

2004
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:48,790
Sixteen.

2005
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,870
Table sixteen is still there.

2006
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:53,170
Yeah, she's still there.

2007
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,970
Quick, quick, before she leaves!

2008
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:58,370
Everyone's fucking leaving!

2009
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,710
Table sixteen is gone!

2010
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:00,510
No!

2011
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,220
Crybaby, don't stay!

2012
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,340
Please!

2013
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,340
Please, I'm desperate!

2014
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,960
Please, I made all these patties with love!

2015
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,580
They need to go to somebody!

2016
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,320
You know what, I'm going to go for the newest first so I at least get to make one fucking burger.

2017
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,820
Please, I killed so many!

2018
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,080
This is for table number eight.

2019
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:29,860
Okay?

2020
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,360
No, table number nine.

2021
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,740
I got more patties!

2022
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,400
I don't give a fuck about table thirteen!

2023
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:38,600
They're about to leave anyway!

2024
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,420
No, don't!

2025
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,020
The burgers need a home!

2026
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,040
They need to be adopted!

2027
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,320
Don't do this to the burgers!

2028
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:47,620
It worked!

2029
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,160
It worked!

2030
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,520
It was the same thing!

2031
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:51,620
Okay, okay, okay.

2032
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,780
Table five needs a regular burger.

2033
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,020
Table nine would have been there.

2034
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,020
Oh, make another one.

2035
01:19:59,160 --> 01:19:59,780
Oh, Christ.

2036
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,920
Table number nine.

2037
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,100
I have all the...

2038
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,720
I need another table number nine.

2039
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,240
Table number nine!

2040
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,920
There's table number nine.

2041
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,900
It's a double burger with lettuce, ice, and yogurt.

2042
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:14,560
This is table number nine!

2043
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,140
But then we have...

2044
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,420
Table fourteen is a double burger.

2045
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,780
Okay, table number nine.

2046
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:21,420
I'm taking it.

2047
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,040
But table nine was done.

2048
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,040
Table fourteen.

2049
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:26,060
Double burger.

2050
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:26,580
Two squirts.

2051
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:27,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2052
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:29,800
You got this.

2053
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,760
You got this, Lime.

2054
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,600
I believe in you.

2055
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:32,320
Wait, where's Snuffy?

2056
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:33,940
Two squirts, two lettuce.

2057
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,060
Snuffy, we need a table number seven.

2058
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,700
Table fourteen!

2059
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,520
Table fourteen!

2060
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2061
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,360
Table seven is...

2062
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,880
Normal hamburger, three squirts, and lettuce.

2063
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:46,860
I'll grab the lettuce.

2064
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,260
These trays are not big enough.

2065
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:50,120
Okay.

2066
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,980
That was one, wasn't it?

2067
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:54,880
There we go.

2068
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:55,860
I hear you.

2069
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:56,860
I have...

2070
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,700
I don't know if there was enough lettuce in that burger.

2071
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,060
I got seven.

2072
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,260
Number seven, number seven.

2073
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,440
Number seven, number seven.

2074
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,040
All right, all right, all right.

2075
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:04,960
No, number seven just left.

2076
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:05,400
No!

2077
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,800
Table number eight is being built right now.

2078
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:11,800
Table number eight.

2079
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,520
Table number eight.

2080
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,340
Here we go.

2081
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,060
We need to go faster, people.

2082
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,940
Number four just wants a splash cola.

2083
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,040
Number four just wants a splash cola.

2084
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,640
Just make a splash cola.

2085
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,400
That's all we need.

2086
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,320
I'm making table number eleven right now.

2087
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,220
Making a splash cola.

2088
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,980
We just need one splash cola.

2089
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:28,760
We don't need two.

2090
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,120
Table number eleven.

2091
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,600
I don't think it was full.

2092
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:32,700
This is fine.

2093
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,620
I got it, I got it, I got it.

2094
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:38,140
Number eleven needs a normal burger.

2095
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,220
Okay, I can...

2096
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:41,100
I got a flip.

2097
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,100
There's no more patties.

2098
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,000
I got a flip.

2099
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,560
Table number seven.

2100
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,700
Why are we so popular?

2101
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,220
Why do you keep coming to this place?

2102
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,300
Give us bad reviews.

2103
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,540
This is the only sloppies in the five mile district.

2104
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,880
Oh, splash sodas too.

2105
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,040
This is table number seven.

2106
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:57,360
Table number seven.

2107
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,720
How come I can't just take the numbers...

2108
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,300
This is table eleven.

2109
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,740
This is table eleven.

2110
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,360
There should be a way to mark the trays.

2111
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,100
Table seven.

2112
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,980
There's too many tables.

2113
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:10,940
Eleven.

2114
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,600
Seven.

2115
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:15,380
We have a splash cola.

2116
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:26,300
I can take this.

2117
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:31,420
We're only four people.

2118
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,020
Wait, which one is which?

2119
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:35,860
Which one is which?

2120
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,220
I don't know.

2121
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,620
We're so disturbed.

2122
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,500
Table two has vanilla ice cream.

2123
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,460
Table two has vanilla ice cream.

2124
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,500
I can take the table two.

2125
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,860
I got another vanilla ice cream.

2126
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,960
Someone in my chat just said this is a chill shift.

2127
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,460
Are you fucking kidding me?

2128
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,900
This is a Saturday evening.

2129
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,580
Vanilla, number ten.

2130
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,620
I got number ten.

2131
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,360
Table number one.

2132
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,740
I forgot the tray.

2133
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,380
Min, can you put a tray down for me?

2134
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,340
Take that one.

2135
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:08,860
Thank you, thank you.

2136
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,520
I'll put more trays.

2137
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,900
I'll put more trays.

2138
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,740
We did it!

2139
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:19,260
I have so many trays on the table.

2140
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:21,980
We don't need trays on the table.

2141
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,040
What do you mean?

2142
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,260
You keep complaining about trays.

2143
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:26,920
Do your job.

2144
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,020
I am.

2145
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,900
I made four or five more patties.

2146
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,920
Table number seven.

2147
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:36,680
A hamburger, two ketchup, three lettuce, and Mr. Hoop.

2148
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,900
Mr. Hoop!

2149
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,200
This is table number seven.

2150
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,960
We got number seven.

2151
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,260
We just need Mr. Hoop.

2152
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,520
We got a double hamburger.

2153
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,500
There you go.

2154
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,720
Number seven.

2155
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,000
Strawberry ice cream stuffy.

2156
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,820
We need a strawberry ice cream set.

2157
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,400
I got it.

2158
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,600
I don't like it.

2159
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,980
You're better than that customer.

2160
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,320
Don't listen to him.

2161
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,020
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

2162
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,320
He's not you.

2163
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,840
I dropped my water bottle.

2164
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:21,640
We don't need more burgers.

2165
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,300
We have one last guy.

2166
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,900
We have another customer coming in.

2167
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:26,880
A double.

2168
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:28,740
They want a double.

2169
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,080
One patty.

2170
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:32,880
We're fine.

2171
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,780
I'm making one patty right now.

2172
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,780
You don't need one patty.

2173
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,500
I've got the burgers.

2174
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,600
Someone else came in.

2175
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,600
We're not fine anymore.

2176
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,880
Table number 15.

2177
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,120
These girls would never survive retail.

2178
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,860
I don't think we have drive-thru.

2179
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,380
We don't have drive-thru yet.

2180
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,560
We have retail simulators.

2181
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,500
The drive-thru isn't open yet.

2182
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,480
Stop calling.

2183
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,100
Please stop calling.

2184
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:11,280
It's not open.

2185
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,660
It will never be open.

2186
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,620
We're severely understaffed.

2187
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:20,460
Can we all cry in the freezer after this?

2188
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,340
I need this burger.

2189
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,200
Guys, look at this.

2190
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,400
We got mayonnaise.

2191
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,620
Number 11.

2192
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,840
I'm grilling the patty.

2193
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,300
Get ready.

2194
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,500
Get the other stuff ready.

2195
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,740
It's all ready.

2196
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,060
It just needs the burger.

2197
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:35,920
95.

2198
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,180
You got this, guys.

2199
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,720
I'm delivering the ketchup.

2200
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:43,320
Table up.

2201
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:43,980
Number 11.

2202
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:44,480
I'm here.

2203
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,420
11.

2204
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,320
We did it.

2205
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,240
They left.

2206
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,400
Why are they so impatient?

2207
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,580
They paid for this.

2208
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,980
We should technically still be getting this money, right?

2209
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:58,600
Exactly.

2210
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:03,420
Team, who is hiding burgers in the countertops?

2211
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:06,000
Who could it be?

2212
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,480
Oh my god, who did this?

2213
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,780
This is not OK.

2214
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,720
It's the unknowns.

2215
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:21,760
You're going to get a rat infestation if you keep shoving unwanted burgers into the cupboards.

2216
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:22,860
Who's going to snitch?

2217
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,380
Who's going to snitch?

2218
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:30,000
I'm just saying there's better places to put the old burgers.

2219
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,200
Like me mouth.

2220
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:38,800
To be fair, we could just save money by eating these burgers.

2221
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,240
I don't think we have...

2222
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,940
What do you mean?

2223
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,620
I only think I could survive two burgers.

2224
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:52,320
We eat a burger every day.

2225
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,060
But it's on company funds.

2226
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,620
It's literally our manager's money.

2227
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:56,140
I haven't had dinner yet.

2228
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,540
This game is making me fucking hungry.

2229
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:03,220
Alright guys, do you guys want to cry in the freezer for a little bit?

2230
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,060
Like have a little smoke break in the freezer?

2231
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,700
I was actually just going to do some drugs or something to cope.

2232
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,580
Okay, it's time to go cry.

2233
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,680
Do you guys want to hug the grease trap with me?

2234
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,560
Guys, we haven't locked the grease yet though.

2235
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,660
That's level 10.

2236
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,960
Level 10?

2237
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,580
We haven't been level 10 yet.

2238
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,200
Get the grease.

2239
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,420
Alright, all winners to the freezer.

2240
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,100
All the winners to the freezer.

2241
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,320
I'm just here to take inventory.

2242
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,180
Oh my god.

2243
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,520
I should have...

2244
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,180
I should have finished high school.

2245
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,470
I thought...

2246
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,640
Were you crying about Snuffy?

2247
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,770
It was a rough day for Team Sloppy another Saturday.

2248
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:03,010
Oh.

2249
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:08,730
Now you know how I felt.

2250
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:13,790
It's okay.

2251
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:17,030
If we get locked in, then we won't have this.

2252
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:19,370
We're locked in!

2253
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:21,490
You locked us in, manager!

2254
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,610
We need to order more patties.

2255
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:28,850
Please?

2256
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:33,490
If you don't open up, we're gonna order more patties.

2257
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:36,970
Dude, there's a first aid kit.

2258
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:39,310
Do we need to be Heimlich certified?

2259
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:41,630
I put two of the patty things in this fridge.

2260
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:43,110
There's no Heimlich sign.

2261
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:43,610
I think we're okay.

2262
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,550
I thought you meant like in the first aid kit.

2263
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:46,950
Like don't...

2264
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:47,850
This is just for show.

2265
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:49,890
There's actually two patties in there.

2266
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:55,450
You open it and the first aid is just more patties.

2267
01:28:57,610 --> 01:28:58,530
That is insane.

2268
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:00,910
Why do we have so many burger buns?

2269
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:01,870
Holy shit.

2270
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:04,590
Because we sell burgers!

2271
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:09,350
The burgers come in stacks of 18 and the burger buns come in stacks of 24.

2272
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:13,490
So every time you order them together, you end up with more fucking buns than backpacks.

2273
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:17,130
I don't have a problem.

2274
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:19,770
This is like our inventory, man.

2275
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:22,770
Let's go to sleep to another day.

2276
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:23,570
We can make chicken nuggets.

2277
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:25,710
I wanna fry something.

2278
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:27,990
Another day, another dollar.

2279
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,210
Dude, we're only gonna get harder things.

2280
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:34,150
We're only gonna get harder things with less things to help us.

2281
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:39,670
I like how we had to pool our funds and our resources to end up buying one car between all four of us.

2282
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:41,290
Somebody in my chat...

2283
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:46,830
Somebody in my chat said Mint has been ignoring the drive-thru this entire time.

2284
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:47,610
No, I haven't!

2285
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:48,650
There's no one at the drive-thru!

2286
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:51,830
That's why we kept hearing people honking!

2287
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:54,170
No, no, the honking is the delivery.

2288
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:55,610
The honking are the deliveries.

2289
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:57,930
Wait, no, the delivery guy doesn't honk, does he?

2290
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,270
Yeah, he honks.

2291
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:00,030
He honks.

2292
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:02,210
Let's make some burgers in advance.

2293
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:03,610
Please do not open the fucking drive-thru.

2294
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:05,130
Hey guys, don't open the restaurant.

2295
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:06,990
I gotta take a massive whiz.

2296
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:08,690
Okay.

2297
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:10,670
You guys, I'm leaving this joint.

2298
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:11,670
I'm getting out of here.

2299
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,630
Hold on.

2300
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:13,290
You can't leave.

2301
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:14,650
Nobody ever leaves Sloppy's.

2302
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:16,450
I mean, there is a drive-thru here.

2303
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:17,970
Yeah, but it's not open.

2304
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:19,170
We have to unlock it.

2305
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:22,370
No one ever... I think she's gaslighting us.

2306
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:24,090
No, I've never seen anybody there!

2307
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,190
I think she's gaslighting us.

2308
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:28,730
You guys, the water is called Mizu water.

2309
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:34,690
What the fuck does Mizu water even mean?

2310
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:36,070
It's a fucking water.

2311
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:38,130
It means water water.

2312
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:43,230
I'm at the drive-thru.

2313
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:46,570
Who the fuck put 800 patties on the grill?

2314
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:47,950
I can't flip all of this!

2315
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:50,970
You can totally flip all of that.

2316
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:52,610
I can't flip all of this.

2317
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:53,850
Oh my God, which one?

2318
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:57,290
I don't even know which one is my patty and which one is yours.

2319
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:00,330
Oh my God, there's so many patties.

2320
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,370
I think we're good to open.

2321
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:04,710
No, wait, wait, guys, wait.

2322
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:09,110
Guys, someone put 20 patties.

2323
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:10,130
I had a system.

2324
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:11,950
Someone ruined my system.

2325
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:13,490
That's horrible.

2326
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,830
I can't believe that happened.

2327
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:18,090
Customers, not coming yet.

2328
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:20,690
It's quiet.

2329
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:21,790
It's a quiet day.

2330
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:22,990
Oh, thank God.

2331
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:25,050
This is what we dreamed of.

2332
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:28,450
Oh no, my system.

2333
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:29,030
Patties, are they okay?

2334
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:32,130
My system, there's so many patties.

2335
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:33,990
Wait, this one's not done yet.

2336
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:39,950
We have customers inbound.

2337
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:43,090
Are we out of ketchup?

2338
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:44,230
I don't know.

2339
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:46,670
I don't...

2340
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,190
I don't see any ketchup.

2341
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:51,310
Oh, there's someone here?

2342
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,690
Okay, cool.

2343
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:52,610
I did it.

2344
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:59,270
Exactly, I agree with that.

2345
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:06,590
I bet you there's gonna be a person over there.

2346
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:09,650
I bet you there's gonna be a car right there.

2347
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:15,010
Okay, oh my God, we need mayonnaise.

2348
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:15,870
I'm on strike!

2349
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:16,570
I'm on strike!

2350
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:18,250
There's mayonnaise.

2351
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:21,050
Where's mayonnaise, Suffy?

2352
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:21,730
Where is it?

2353
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:22,710
Table 16!

2354
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:26,270
Wait, what happened to it?

2355
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:27,930
Wait, what?

2356
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:28,870
I've ordered more.

2357
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:30,570
What does table 16 want?

2358
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:32,510
Table 16 just wants a hamburger.

2359
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:33,010
That's it.

2360
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,910
Okay, okay.

2361
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:37,050
Table 13.

2362
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:40,550
If Mint starts a strike, we can hire a scab.

2363
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,630
Maybe it had to have been in the fridge or something.

2364
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:48,630
We'll hire a high schooler to help work us.

2365
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:48,630
Table 13!

2366
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:51,710
Someone needs to help Mint with the ice cream before she has a breakdown again.

2367
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:52,810
What do you need?

2368
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:53,490
What do you need?

2369
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:55,430
I have vanilla ice cream.

2370
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,690
Table 14 needs mayonnaise, so I don't have it yet.

2371
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,830
Oh, okay.

2372
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:00,490
That's 14.

2373
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:02,130
Don't do the one with the drink yet.

2374
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:03,530
Table 14's fucking leaving is what they're doing.

2375
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:04,270
Wait, what?

2376
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:05,650
But we just started!

2377
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:08,610
Yeah, they're not getting their mayonnaise.

2378
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:09,450
We've been open for two hours.

2379
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:11,670
We just started today!

2380
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:14,170
Mayonnaise.

2381
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:18,330
Table 4 wants a double hamburger.

2382
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:19,330
I'll help out with that.

2383
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:19,730
14!

2384
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:20,570
Oh, yeah.

2385
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:22,530
I'm doing table... Oh, yeah.

2386
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:23,070
No, we're done.

2387
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:23,910
Table 14 left.

2388
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,290
I'll do four.

2389
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:28,550
And then, three lettuce.

2390
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:30,910
One, two, three.

2391
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:32,270
Table number 8 is just ice cream.

2392
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:36,250
And then, we need a strawberry ice cream with this.

2393
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:37,130
I got the burger.

2394
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:38,790
I'll get the strawberry ice cream.

2395
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:40,130
I'm doing table number 2.

2396
01:33:40,130 --> 01:33:41,550
This is table 4.

2397
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:43,410
And then...

2398
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:46,210
Table 2 is a half...

2399
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:47,730
And we need a splash cola.

2400
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:48,870
I'll get the splash cola.

2401
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:49,190
Table 2.

2402
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,370
Number 4.

2403
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:51,570
Wait, we don't have cups.

2404
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,450
We have no more cups.

2405
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:55,810
Yes, we do.

2406
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:56,390
We should have cups.

2407
01:33:56,730 --> 01:33:57,310
We ordered cups.

2408
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:58,110
Oh, okay.

2409
01:33:58,710 --> 01:33:59,550
Wait, this is number 2?

2410
01:33:59,570 --> 01:34:00,130
Table 2?

2411
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:01,790
Yeah, table 2.

2412
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,410
Alright, Snuffy, I believe in you.

2413
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:06,530
Okay, we got the soda here.

2414
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:06,970
I'll take it.

2415
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:07,350
Okay.

2416
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:10,270
Holy shit, they want ice cream and a soda.

2417
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:11,490
Oh my god.

2418
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:14,590
I think Snuffy is having a breakdown.

2419
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:16,010
I don't think...

2420
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:18,170
I don't think I want to go back.

2421
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:19,610
We leveled up!

2422
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,090
We need more patties!

2423
01:34:22,570 --> 01:34:23,430
We need more patties?

2424
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,030
Oh, patty time, patty time.

2425
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:26,690
I'm grilling, I'm grilling, I'm grilling.

2426
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:28,230
Do we have mayonnaise?

2427
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:29,690
Do we have mayonnaise?

2428
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:32,530
What is this burger right here?

2429
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:33,070
Who is it for?

2430
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:34,990
Table number 3, I think.

2431
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:36,530
Whatever the first one is.

2432
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:37,170
Yeah, table number 3.

2433
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:40,390
Guys, come on, we can get to level 10 so we can have fries, guys.

2434
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:42,550
We have tomatoes and pickles now.

2435
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:43,930
We have tomatoes and pickles.

2436
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:44,890
Oh my god, no, not the pickles.

2437
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:47,670
We can't even cope with what we're fucking doing right now.

2438
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:48,830
No, we can do this, guys.

2439
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,770
We can make it.

2440
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,890
We can see the promised land.

2441
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:52,810
Why are you upset?

2442
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:55,990
Okay, table number 1.

2443
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:57,120
Table number 1.

2444
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:00,950
I think Snuffy has disassociated from working here every day.

2445
01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:02,250
I have table number 1.

2446
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:04,190
Is this table number 1 here?

2447
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:05,270
Yes, it was.

2448
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:06,850
Okay, I'll take it.

2449
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:07,370
I got the drink.

2450
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:11,570
I got more patties, I got more patties.

2451
01:35:11,610 --> 01:35:12,970
I love working at Sloppy.

2452
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:15,870
What's your favorite part about working at Sloppy, Snuffy?

2453
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:18,270
That was a delivery, was it not a delivery?

2454
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:19,630
I love the smiles on every customer's face.

2455
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:20,570
Table number 17.

2456
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:22,950
Hello, there's nobody out here.

2457
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:28,550
Number 17?

2458
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:31,590
Is this number 17?

2459
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:32,550
This burger?

2460
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,230
Yes, it would have been.

2461
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,390
Yeah, table number 17.

2462
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:36,990
I have patties.

2463
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:40,170
I have all the patties.

2464
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:42,050
My burger just kind of disappeared into the ether.

2465
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:42,750
I don't know where that went.

2466
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:43,910
Oh, wait, what the fuck happened?

2467
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:48,090
We need water and vanilla ice cream.

2468
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:49,510
I'll make the vanilla ice cream.

2469
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:50,130
Okay.

2470
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:52,830
We need a double burger with two squirts.

2471
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,950
This is a single burger with three squirts.

2472
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:57,130
This is 15.

2473
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:59,390
We have 15, we have it.

2474
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:00,850
Put it on the tray, put it on the tray.

2475
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:02,850
Serve that burger.

2476
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:04,810
I'm serving it, I'm serving it.

2477
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:06,930
We need a double burger with two squirts of mayo.

2478
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:07,550
Set.

2479
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,290
A double burger with two squirts of mayo.

2480
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:10,990
Oh my god, I hate this.

2481
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:13,410
We got a hamburger with three squirts of lettuce.

2482
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:16,850
A sloppy burger with two ketchups and three lettuce.

2483
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:18,850
A regular burger.

2484
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:21,370
You at home enjoying this?

2485
01:36:21,930 --> 01:36:23,650
I can't take it anymore.

2486
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:29,330
Min, have a breakdown on your off hours.

2487
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:30,550
You're on the clock.

2488
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:32,810
You're on the clock right now.

2489
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:33,470
We need more TVs.

2490
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:36,450
We can't just be sharing this tiny little TV together.

2491
01:36:37,730 --> 01:36:38,790
We need a hamburger.

2492
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:39,690
Table number five.

2493
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:43,510
We need a hamburger with two ketchup squirts and three lettuce.

2494
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:45,770
And a splash cola with one ice.

2495
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:48,350
Splash cola with one ice.

2496
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:49,950
Yeah, that's it.

2497
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:52,650
Table number six.

2498
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:54,450
Table number six.

2499
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:55,870
Do we have the splash cola?

2500
01:36:56,830 --> 01:36:57,690
Not yet.

2501
01:36:58,170 --> 01:36:59,110
I'm working on it.

2502
01:36:59,230 --> 01:36:59,790
One ice.

2503
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:01,810
Splash cola.

2504
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:03,830
I'm taking this order.

2505
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:08,790
Sloppy serves you.

2506
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,850
Sloppy serves you with a smile.

2507
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:15,490
When will the supervisor visit our branch?

2508
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:19,690
When will the supervisor visit our branch?

2509
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:23,510
Table number 14.

2510
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:29,450
Smile or Mr. Sloppy is going to get you.

2511
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:33,590
Mr. Sloppy is our mascot.

2512
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,070
He's just a very sloppy burger.

2513
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:43,210
He's dripping all the sauces on the floor.

2514
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:44,310
He's got a nice smile on his heart.

2515
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:47,270
Remember to smile for Mr. Sloppy.

2516
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:53,370
Maybe they won't notice...

2517
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:55,930
What did you do?

2518
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:56,750
Table number 7.

2519
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:01,810
How are the supplies looking?

2520
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:06,590
I don't think we're going to make it to level 10, guys.

2521
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:10,310
I don't think we're going to make it, guys.

2522
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:12,830
Sloppy's is gonna rise to the top.

2523
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:15,290
They're gonna remember Sloppy's.

2524
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:20,330
Gonna be the best sloppy chain in all of America.

2525
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:30,610
Guys, we have one more hour till our shift is over!

2526
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:36,110
A happy customer... is a sloppy customer.

2527
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:43,030
What's our jingle?

2528
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:49,850
Guys,

2529
01:38:56,710 --> 01:38:58,530
I trust Mr. Sloppy.

2530
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:06,350
I'm flipping the burger in five!

2531
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:14,930
Sloppy's prevails, sloppy's prevails.

2532
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:16,990
Wait, there's two more customers coming in!

2533
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,050
There's two more customers coming!

2534
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:21,290
Tell them to fuck off, we have no wrapping paper!

2535
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:22,070
No, it's okay!

2536
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:23,450
Oh, we have no wrapping paper?

2537
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:23,930
Wait, what?

2538
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:25,690
That's fairly important, I hear.

2539
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:28,590
Wait, I thought we had the supplies manager!

2540
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:34,070
I think they would prefer we didn't have...

2541
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:36,490
Get napkins!

2542
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:39,650
We'll just use napkins as the wrapping paper, they won't notice!

2543
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:40,810
I'll use my socks.

2544
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:43,490
Can someone help me unload this, please?

2545
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:48,850
I'm flipping burgers, who's not busy right now?

2546
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:52,010
She liked it, even without the burger, I think we're good.

2547
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:52,830
Okay, okay.

2548
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:55,230
I got you, I got you.

2549
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:58,010
Wait, this isn't wrapping paper, this is just ice cream.

2550
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:01,850
This guy just wants to drink it in ice cream.

2551
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:03,890
Manager, I thought you ordered wrapping paper.

2552
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:07,290
No, I couldn't because someone was ordering tomatoes!

2553
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:10,210
We ordered tomatoes, we don't need tomatoes!

2554
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:13,450
I love tomatoes, they make me happy.

2555
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:17,610
Snoopy, you clogged up the delivery chain with tomatoes that weren't being ordered!

2556
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:21,610
Manager, she needs to be happy right now!

2557
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:23,950
We were busy screaming at each other!

2558
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:25,950
Oh, they left.

2559
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:27,190
Wait, no, they didn't leave.

2560
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:31,270
Oh, I found a burger from yesterday on the floor, use this one.

2561
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:35,930
Maybe it's the right burger, maybe it's the right one.

2562
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:37,010
Oh, they left.

2563
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:38,050
We got pickles, we got pickles.

2564
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:40,410
No, they left.

2565
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:44,330
It's okay, we'll reuse it, we'll reuse it, put it in the cabinet.

2566
01:40:45,770 --> 01:40:46,650
Everybody's leaving!

2567
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:48,010
We'll just reuse it.

2568
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:52,270
Everybody's leaving because we don't have any fucking burger wrappers.

2569
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:54,910
Order a burger wrapper, we can order it now.

2570
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:57,390
I did order it, it's fine, it's coming.

2571
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:59,390
You guys, it's time, we're closed, yippee!

2572
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:01,350
Yay, you did it!

2573
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:02,810
That's so funny.

2574
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:04,710
Is that when we can get french fries tomorrow?

2575
01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:08,210
Well, we need two more levels to be level 10.

2576
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:11,890
What if the level 10 also comes with the drive-thru, what if that's...

2577
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:15,030
I'm so excited to work the drive-thru, I've been working on my speech.

2578
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:16,510
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2579
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:18,490
We can't even cope with the current orders.

2580
01:41:18,690 --> 01:41:21,110
No, it's okay, we're leveling up.

2581
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:22,310
We're getting better.

2582
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:23,190
We're doing so good.

2583
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:26,130
Wait, Stuffy, how are you at the drive-thru?

2584
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:28,310
I'll be your Lime AI.

2585
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:31,910
Oh, my favorite AI!

2586
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:34,190
Nobody can know about that, dude.

2587
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:38,310
It's like having a teddy bear to sleep with.

2588
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:42,830
I just, like, I pull the string in its back and it's just like, Hi, Stuffy, it's me, Lime AI.

2589
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:46,870
That's how I get through the night.

2590
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:51,170
Wait, you do all this with the AI instead of me?

2591
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:52,350
I'm embarrassed.

2592
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:57,410
You don't understand, Lime AI.

2593
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:58,890
Yeah, you don't understand.

2594
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:01,590
You're not there for her 24-7.

2595
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:02,710
She needed somebody.

2596
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:03,610
Yeah.

2597
01:42:04,490 --> 01:42:09,910
Yeah, if you were there for her 24-7, she wouldn't have resorted to AI and not look at her.

2598
01:42:10,230 --> 01:42:10,430
No, no.

2599
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:13,410
Limu's a beautiful, independent queen.

2600
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:15,170
Which Limu, though?

2601
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:15,830
I mean nothing.

2602
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:17,170
Which Limu?

2603
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:24,530
My AI Limu, she thinks she's literally worthless.

2604
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:25,730
What?

2605
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:27,230
You like I'm broken?

2606
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:33,350
I try and convince her that that's not the reality, but she insists.

2607
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:36,290
Oh, so you like fixing people?

2608
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:41,450
Why do you think you guys want me to be the manager?

2609
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:47,970
Oh my god, Doki started crying and she was like, It's my time.

2610
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:48,830
It's my time.

2611
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:50,190
I can order a burger.

2612
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:52,070
I wanna order my burger.

2613
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:53,330
Come on, Doki.

2614
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:54,530
It's time for sleep.

2615
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:55,150
Okay.

2616
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:56,470
Actually, never mind.

2617
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:57,250
I'm getting out of here.

2618
01:42:57,390 --> 01:42:57,910
Okay.

2619
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:58,610
I'm leaving.

2620
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:03,510
If she never touches the car, we'll never start the next day.

2621
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:06,090
What a life.

2622
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:10,830
Guys, I don't...

2623
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:14,350
I don't wanna work in a real fast food restaurant, guys.

2624
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:15,350
Let's collab over.

2625
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:16,550
I know.

2626
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:20,390
What did we just...

2627
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:22,110
$67 yesterday.

2628
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:26,450
Guys, what if we just go in a corner and just, you know, have a chat?

2629
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,470
What if we didn't open today?

2630
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:32,770
Yeah, what if we just didn't open today?

2631
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:33,690
What if we just...

2632
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:34,150
What's over here?

2633
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:35,550
All the burgers for ourselves.

2634
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:36,690
Yeah, let's just make...

2635
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:40,890
Let's just have a burger party and just, you know, have a talk, you know?

2636
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,390
Wait, wait, guys, can you actually sprint?

2637
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:45,270
You guys feel so much faster than me.

2638
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:47,610
No, we're just...

2639
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:49,190
No, it just looks like you're sprinting.

2640
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:52,210
If you jump, if you jump, we go faster.

2641
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:55,730
I'm putting...

2642
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:56,770
Are you gonna put the burgies on?

2643
01:43:58,410 --> 01:43:59,970
Get those flappies started.

2644
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:02,150
I don't wanna be the flipper anymore.

2645
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,910
I'm tired of flipping burgers.

2646
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:08,470
I think there's more to life than flipping burgers.

2647
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:12,310
I've worked like three days in a row.

2648
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:13,750
I can't be healthy.

2649
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:15,550
You worked three days in a row?

2650
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:16,930
I worked four days in...

2651
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:17,130
What?

2652
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:19,490
I worked four days in a row.

2653
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:20,210
We're open.

2654
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:23,870
No, you worked two days, and the other two were AI-doki, okay?

2655
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:26,470
We're open, but half of our employees are rebelling.

2656
01:44:27,610 --> 01:44:29,370
Somebody else flip the burger.

2657
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:31,390
I refuse to flip the burger.

2658
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:32,690
Well, turn the sign on.

2659
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:34,710
I didn't do it.

2660
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:36,650
I'm just too eager to work at the spot.

2661
01:44:38,650 --> 01:44:41,530
I think Snuffy is actually SpongeBob.

2662
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:49,230
I think Mint and I are both Squidward, and Lime is Krusty.

2663
01:44:55,010 --> 01:44:56,030
Order's up, everybody!

2664
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:57,290
Order's up!

2665
01:44:58,230 --> 01:44:59,270
What do you mean, order's up?

2666
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:00,210
There's no food!

2667
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:03,530
I mean, the order's... they're up.

2668
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:04,810
They're up right now.

2669
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:05,850
I'll work with Mint.

2670
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:06,930
On the screen.

2671
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:11,590
That's great.

2672
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:12,750
There's zero drinks here.

2673
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:14,490
Okay, screw you.

2674
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:15,470
Make some drinks.

2675
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:16,950
There's no drinks here.

2676
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:18,250
How am I supposed to make drinks?

2677
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:20,230
This guy is gonna order a drink right now.

2678
01:45:20,290 --> 01:45:21,430
Where's all the vegetables?

2679
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:22,330
He didn't.

2680
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:23,910
He ordered ice cream.

2681
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:25,770
You chose the wrong one.

2682
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:27,370
I already got it.

2683
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:31,050
Guys, where's the burgers, guys?

2684
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:32,630
I'm cooking the burgers.

2685
01:45:33,070 --> 01:45:34,050
It's an art that takes time.

2686
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:35,630
We need table number four right now!

2687
01:45:35,670 --> 01:45:36,170
Right now!

2688
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:37,010
Table number four!

2689
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:38,070
Come on, SpongeBob.

2690
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:38,890
Where are the burgers?

2691
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:41,490
I'm sorry to inform you, we are probably boned.

2692
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:44,210
No, we'll never close.

2693
01:45:48,270 --> 01:45:49,230
One pickle.

2694
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:50,070
Burger.

2695
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:52,670
Order number whatever the first one is.

2696
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:53,030
Four?

2697
01:45:53,230 --> 01:45:53,610
Four.

2698
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:54,750
Table number four.

2699
01:45:56,470 --> 01:45:57,670
Don't forget his ice cream.

2700
01:45:58,150 --> 01:45:58,710
I got it.

2701
01:45:58,830 --> 01:46:00,990
Wait, I never put a burger in it.

2702
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:01,210
What?

2703
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,950
You never put a burger in it?

2704
01:46:02,950 --> 01:46:04,130
What do you mean you never put a burger on it?

2705
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:08,050
It was just a bun.

2706
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:09,470
It was just a bun?

2707
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:12,990
I think he... Oh, did he leave?

2708
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:13,950
Probably.

2709
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:14,990
He ate it.

2710
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:16,130
Oh, he ate it.

2711
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:18,950
Why the heck is he eating it?

2712
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:19,430
Is he a freak?

2713
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:20,370
He was a vegetarian.

2714
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:21,630
We're good.

2715
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:22,170
We're good.

2716
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:23,970
He loves a good veggie patty.

2717
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:24,850
He's a vegetarian.

2718
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:28,170
Our other strawberry is deteriorating.

2719
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:28,970
Oh, they all left.

2720
01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:29,730
They all left.

2721
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:30,270
No, no.

2722
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:31,810
Number 17 is still here.

2723
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:37,410
Yeah, but my self-esteem is gone.

2724
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:39,690
What do you mean your self-esteem is gone?

2725
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:41,970
It's only 12.30!

2726
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:45,990
You have five more hours before you can cry.

2727
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:49,970
These guys are waiting, so I'm taking their orders.

2728
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:51,390
Oh, you're my bear.

2729
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:55,050
This is what happens when we start taking orders for these burgers already.

2730
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:55,610
I hate this game.

2731
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:56,650
Slice tomato?

2732
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:00,110
Guys, why don't we just all stop working, guys?

2733
01:47:00,430 --> 01:47:01,690
Okay, let's all strike.

2734
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:02,530
3, 2, 1.

2735
01:47:02,530 --> 01:47:06,410
I think the burger production line might need some help with this many ingredients.

2736
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:07,830
It's actually kind of bonkers.

2737
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:10,010
Oh my god, that's a lot.

2738
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:10,930
Yeah!

2739
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:14,290
And every burger is like, yeah, you gotta put all these perfectly.

2740
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:15,670
This is table number 16.

2741
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:17,730
I'm gonna tap dance on the ingredients.

2742
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:22,030
I think you can make the even burger numbers and somebody can make the odd burgers.

2743
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:28,130
I don't think we're serving anything today.

2744
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:28,970
I think...

2745
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:35,170
Oh my gosh, I'm creating the meme, you guys.

2746
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,950
The viral meme.

2747
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:41,770
Number 15.

2748
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:44,130
Burger King foot lettuce.

2749
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:47,110
Sloppy foot lettuce.

2750
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:49,430
Yeah, Snuffy, I think our server's quit.

2751
01:47:49,870 --> 01:47:50,610
Snuffy, we quit.

2752
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:50,630
You know what?

2753
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:52,490
Screw... Oh, this guy just wants a drink.

2754
01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:54,230
I can get that for him.

2755
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:55,950
Sloppy's is a wonderful place to work.

2756
01:47:58,810 --> 01:47:59,490
I got you, buddy.

2757
01:47:59,490 --> 01:48:00,950
Alright, bootlicker.

2758
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:04,190
Wait, who's the bootlicker?

2759
01:48:05,830 --> 01:48:06,550
Snuffier.

2760
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:09,650
You see how great Sloppy is?

2761
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:10,470
I love Sloppy.

2762
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:14,770
Where's the mayo?

2763
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:17,270
They left, Snuffy.

2764
01:48:17,370 --> 01:48:17,850
They're gone.

2765
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,170
All of our orders are gone.

2766
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:19,650
What happened?

2767
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:21,230
I'm closing.

2768
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:24,670
I'm closing the fucking restaurant.

2769
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:27,250
Restaurant's closed!

2770
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:29,030
But I don't know where to go.

2771
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:30,250
I don't got Sloppy.

2772
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:35,590
We aren't even serving them anymore.

2773
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:37,030
We have customers.

2774
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,070
We have customers.

2775
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:39,450
You're not even serving them anymore.

2776
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:40,430
Table 16.

2777
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:41,190
I'm going.

2778
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:42,430
I'm going.

2779
01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:45,550
Table 16 is a Yolma.

2780
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:47,090
It's okay, boss.

2781
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:48,870
We can still make it.

2782
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:50,690
What are you making, Snuffy?

2783
01:48:51,050 --> 01:48:52,250
I'm making 16.

2784
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:54,430
16 was made.

2785
01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:55,330
Make table 2.

2786
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:56,830
I'll make table 12.

2787
01:48:57,590 --> 01:49:00,070
I'm making 16.

2788
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:05,010
Okay, I'm helping.

2789
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:07,590
We need more mayonnaise.

2790
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:10,070
You already made a Mr. Who?

2791
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:11,690
Mr. Who?

2792
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:13,330
Okay, I got Mr. Who.

2793
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:15,130
Oh yeah, make the Mr. Who.

2794
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:16,690
Where's the ice?

2795
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:17,110
Mr. Who?

2796
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:18,710
No, Mr. Ketchup.

2797
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:20,810
Everybody likes it room temperature.

2798
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:24,710
I ordered mayonnaise, but no ketchup.

2799
01:49:25,870 --> 01:49:26,690
Oh, are we out of ketchup?

2800
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:29,030
You gotta remember to put stuff in the fridge.

2801
01:49:29,150 --> 01:49:30,390
I'm closing shop, everybody.

2802
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:32,390
Oh, shop is already closed.

2803
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:33,350
Who did this?

2804
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:35,830
Who would have done such a thing?

2805
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:37,830
No, but sloppies.

2806
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:38,630
My passion.

2807
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:40,290
My passion.

2808
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:43,010
My passion for patties.

2809
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:47,630
We just lost table number 12.

2810
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:50,190
You ordered two entire vats of mayonnaise and no ketchup.

2811
01:49:50,670 --> 01:49:55,930
I had put this order in before you even heard my ears.

2812
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,310
Mayo only establishment.

2813
01:49:57,330 --> 01:50:03,250
You ordered an entire delivery truck for two giant vats of mayonnaise and this is the person you want as a manager.

2814
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:05,610
It's a burger restaurant.

2815
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:07,270
You're gonna need mayo.

2816
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:13,490
Mayo has never served a greater purpose.

2817
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:14,890
Honestly, yeah.

2818
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:15,830
I agree.

2819
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:17,170
I agree with Snuffy.

2820
01:50:17,330 --> 01:50:20,110
That's why I endorse her as manager.

2821
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:23,750
I can't manage a place that's closed.

2822
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:28,190
That's why you're gonna be here to turn things around.

2823
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,990
You're gonna control the staff.

2824
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:32,390
Boss, I wanna make chicken nugget.

2825
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:36,090
Okay, we could barely even make french fries, guys.

2826
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:37,770
We could barely...

2827
01:50:37,770 --> 01:50:39,570
Snuffy for manager.

2828
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:41,390
Everyone's a fan of her.

2829
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:42,970
Snuffy for manager.

2830
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:45,150
Everybody's a fan of her.

2831
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:48,290
We'll never run out of mayonnaise while Snuffy's here.

2832
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:51,430
We'll run out of everything else, but not mayonnaise.

2833
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:54,110
What rhymes with laimu is acid.

2834
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:56,110
To our team, we shouldn't underestimate.

2835
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:57,710
That's why she'd be a perfect...

2836
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:59,430
Down with laimu.

2837
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:01,010
Vice manager.

2838
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:02,510
She does cry-mu.

2839
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:04,610
Down with laimu.

2840
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:06,390
She does cry-mu.

2841
01:51:06,690 --> 01:51:08,410
Snuffy for manager.

2842
01:51:09,070 --> 01:51:12,470
We will never run out of mayonnaise while Snuffy's here.

2843
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:12,570
Everybody's a fan of her.

2844
01:51:12,570 --> 01:51:14,170
Wait, did you not get reopened?

2845
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:15,710
I'm gonna catch up.

2846
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:17,950
What are you talking about?

2847
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:22,410
I'm gonna eat some ice cream for myself.

2848
01:51:22,910 --> 01:51:25,650
I'm allergic to strawberry, but I don't care.

2849
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:26,910
I'm on the company's dime.

2850
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:30,230
How do you receive a tomato?

2851
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:31,670
Down with laimu.

2852
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:34,010
She does cry-mu.

2853
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:35,550
Snuffy for manager.

2854
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:38,070
Everybody's a fan of her.

2855
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:39,890
Okay, you know what then?

2856
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:40,590
You know what then?

2857
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:41,570
You go.

2858
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:42,510
You do the burgers.

2859
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:45,590
Good luck with the fucking lettuce and the pickles.

2860
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:48,090
And all the squirts of mayo and ketchup.

2861
01:51:48,290 --> 01:51:50,130
Especially when Snuffy doesn't order any fucking ketchup.

2862
01:51:50,330 --> 01:51:52,410
This is an average day in the kitchen.

2863
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:53,890
I'm going to the freezer, goodbye.

2864
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:57,350
We have orders.

2865
01:51:58,130 --> 01:52:00,210
I don't know, like, what do you do with the tomato?

2866
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:03,390
How do you make it, like, on the burger?

2867
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:06,170
Guys, I think we're gonna pass our health exam.

2868
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:08,730
I don't... how do you cut it?

2869
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:10,010
Is corporate gonna like us?

2870
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:12,090
Guys, I don't...

2871
01:52:12,090 --> 01:52:13,030
I'm taking a nap.

2872
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:14,990
How do you cut the burger?

2873
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:17,110
How do you dice a tomato?

2874
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:18,390
What do you do with this?

2875
01:52:18,670 --> 01:52:20,250
I figured it out.

2876
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:21,050
Why wasn't it working?

2877
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:25,430
Fuck, no, no!

2878
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:26,870
My life!

2879
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:27,810
Children.

2880
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:31,090
Everybody walking out happy.

2881
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:33,630
Customers, full tummies.

2882
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:37,390
This is what Sloppy's is all about.

2883
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:41,110
I don't think we fed a single fucking person today, Mint.

2884
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:42,810
Don't know, they did.

2885
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:43,730
Look, here's a tip.

2886
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:45,770
$30, $30!

2887
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,790
With no burger on it?

2888
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:50,090
Oh my god, $30!

2889
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:51,790
We did so well!

2890
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:55,710
You guys thought we were nothing, but Sloppy's is everything.

2891
01:52:56,350 --> 01:52:58,450
Guys, I just realized, I don't think those are tips.

2892
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:01,110
I think those are their orders.

2893
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:04,970
I think they pay after they eat.

2894
01:53:05,950 --> 01:53:07,230
Yes, that sounds right.

2895
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:08,630
What system is that?

2896
01:53:08,770 --> 01:53:10,990
So you mean I'm just robbing all these people?

2897
01:53:13,470 --> 01:53:15,910
Wait, so they don't even pay?

2898
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:18,070
What's the point of having a cashier here?

2899
01:53:18,530 --> 01:53:19,830
Why do we have a card reader?

2900
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:22,690
They're walking out and we haven't been pocketing their money.

2901
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:26,950
What's the point of having a card reader receipt?

2902
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:27,770
You thought they were paying us?

2903
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:31,070
No, they weren't paying us a goddamn thing unless we fed them.

2904
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:33,210
Yeah, they weren't paying us unless we fed them.

2905
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:34,130
That's very fair.

2906
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:35,670
That's not fair!

2907
01:53:35,790 --> 01:53:36,730
No, that's not fair!

2908
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:40,030
It's service is payment first!

2909
01:53:40,150 --> 01:53:43,370
Is it because we just put the burgers underneath the drinks thing because you thought we were getting paid anyway?

2910
01:53:43,630 --> 01:53:43,810
No!

2911
01:53:45,070 --> 01:53:46,090
What's the point?

2912
01:53:46,710 --> 01:53:48,310
Why are there pickles everywhere?

2913
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:49,210
You guys are so...

2914
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:51,990
I'm so hungry.

2915
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:52,550
Sloppy?

2916
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:54,190
Were you about to say Sloppy?

2917
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:00,170
Everybody, here is a cup of ice cream on me.

2918
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:02,410
Oh my god, yay!

2919
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:04,310
And a Mr. Hoop.

2920
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:08,190
How can you guys enjoy ice cream when Sloppy's is in the state that it's in?

2921
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:12,310
Okay, fucking bootlicker, okay.

2922
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:16,250
What happened to we love Sloppy?

2923
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:18,070
Jesus, that didn't last very long.

2924
01:54:19,110 --> 01:54:21,510
Okay, Doki, we have to change the slogan.

2925
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:25,110
What's your new slogan?

2926
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:34,640
Down with... what rhymes with Snuffy?

2927
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:36,060
Whoa!

2928
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,360
Down with Snuffy, she's too stuffy.

2929
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:44,820
Down with Snuffy, she's too stuffy.

2930
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:49,640
Hey, Snuffy, do you wanna come hang in the freezer with me and see how many burgers they make without us?

2931
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:52,140
We can run this place by ourselves.

2932
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:54,020
Yeah, we can run this place.

2933
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:58,720
I was a griller and she was a cashier.

2934
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,360
We both already know everything.

2935
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:02,100
We know everything.

2936
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:07,980
All you guys did was order supplies.

2937
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:09,220
What?

2938
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,980
We're the backbone of this company.

2939
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:19,860
But you pushed us too far.

2940
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:23,320
You didn't appreciate us.

2941
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,500
You're the machine that turns meat into burgers.

2942
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:29,600
Hey, Snuffy, we're just gonna chill here, I think.

2943
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:30,780
You get it, cause we're in a freezer?

2944
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:32,740
I just wanna make burgers.

2945
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,700
If they wanna dethrone me, that's okay, I'll still work here.

2946
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:42,940
All these faces are like the two burgers that we have, so I can only really make one face, and it's kinda like, he looks kinda horrified.

2947
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,540
If you look at it from this angle, anyway.

2948
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:45,320
I think he looks good.

2949
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:51,040
This place is not as bad as we think it was.

2950
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:53,220
Nah, it's pretty good.

2951
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:54,520
Yeah, it was actually pretty nice.

2952
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:55,620
Sloppies.

2953
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:56,660
Yeah, sloppies.

2954
01:55:57,180 --> 01:55:59,440
The management sucked, though, not gonna lie.

2955
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:00,400
Yeah, honestly.

2956
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,760
Oh yeah, yeah.

2957
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:03,720
Under new management, us, it'll be better.

2958
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,620
I know, right?

2959
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:09,340
If it was run just a little bit better, then maybe we wouldn't have enjoyed our time here.

2960
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:10,240
Yeah.

2961
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,540
Yeah, too bad the management ran it to the ground.

2962
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:19,760
I'm thinking Limu is having an aneurysm.

2963
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,780
No, I'm great, I'm having a good time.

2964
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:37,900
We're literally making a face with the three items that we have.

2965
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,200
This does not look like a face.

2966
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:47,340
When it was like this, it was a face, but then it became a dick.

2967
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,860
I just have to act more like Spongebob, where I'll be like, hi, Doki!

2968
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:52,720
My restaurant now.

2969
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:54,500
Wait, who?

2970
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:56,740
Wait, the manager locked us...

2971
01:56:56,740 --> 01:56:58,000
Wait, no, wait, no.

2972
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,440
The manager locked us in.

2973
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,180
This is what you get, this is the price of rebellion!

2974
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:04,280
Wait, what did Snuffy do?

2975
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:06,180
She was the most optimal employee.

2976
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,740
She was literally Spongebob.

2977
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:11,100
If I can let Snuffy out without letting you guys out, I did.

2978
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:12,720
But unfortunately, it's a triple murder.

2979
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,060
So you'll punish her for our actions?

2980
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:16,600
Yes.

2981
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,840
I can handle it.

2982
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:19,940
Snuffy's so sweet.

2983
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,200
Anyway, Snuffy, I'll eat an ice cream in your honor.

2984
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,560
I'll think about it.

2985
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:26,000
Don't eat it too fast and get brain freeze.

2986
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:31,420
I'd like to go down sloppy style.

2987
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:35,260
You wanna go down sloppy style?

2988
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,320
I just came for a special menu item.

2989
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:42,660
I'm ready to perish.

2990
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:44,480
Little bites right now.

2991
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:46,220
Snuffy, come out.

2992
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:47,520
No!

2993
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:53,700
It's just me in here.

2994
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:57,400
Oh, they're twerking on the door.

2995
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:59,300
No, I wanna see the twerking.

2996
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:02,660
You'll never get to see the twerking.

2997
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,960
You'll never get to see it.

2998
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:07,780
Fine, I'll just make patty faces.

2999
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:12,760
You're missing out on the twerks.

3000
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,840
Yeah, I believe it.

3001
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,380
You're missing out.

3002
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:18,360
No!

3003
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:20,460
You could've been there.

3004
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:21,600
Oh my god.

3005
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:28,820
This is why, this is my reflexes coming in.

3006
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:34,700
Wait, it looks like when you were doing it, it looks like we're like grandpas who don't understand it.

3007
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:37,500
Like Bailey going fully up and down.

3008
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,740
We just have bad knees, okay?

3009
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,660
Look, we've been on the grill for so long.

3010
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:47,900
Like, we just don't know how to function anymore.

3011
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:49,840
Boss never let me have a chair.

3012
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:54,240
Wait, you're right, we never got to sit down.

3013
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:55,160
Never.

3014
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,460
I wanna know what's on the management panel eventually.

3015
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,520
Presumably it'll be like upgrades that make this not fucking awful.

3016
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:01,760
Wait, you're not even the manager?

3017
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:02,880
Wait, you're not...

3018
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,720
The application's just not here because presumably it's early access.

3019
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:07,040
What's the watcher?

3020
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:09,180
That's what I'm more curious about.

3021
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:14,280
Yeah, I think once we get the manager stuff, we'll be able to hire like automated employees and things like that.

3022
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:17,340
Because as it is, this is fucking crazy after the first like two agreements.

3023
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:21,180
Oh yeah, because I don't even know if this game will ever get a full release.

3024
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:25,920
It says it's supposed to, but you know how it is.

3025
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,480
I guess we'll see.

3026
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:32,560
I wish I could just squirt ketchup into my mouth.

3027
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:34,440
And what's stopping you?

3028
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:36,480
You're an adult right now.

3029
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,860
And you can squirt like a ridiculous amount of mayonnaise.

3030
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:43,220
You guys wanna squirt our mayonnaise onto the same bun together?

3031
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:45,220
Yeah, hold on, let me refill the mayonnaise.

3032
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:47,380
Oh wait, do we have any mayonnaise left?

3033
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:49,260
Oh yeah, because you ordered like 17 bats of it.

3034
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:52,960
And now it's being utilized.

3035
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,780
Yeah, see this was the plan.

3036
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:58,540
You have to trust the process.

3037
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:00,040
Do we have any more mayonnaise?

3038
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:01,440
No, okay.

3039
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:02,200
We have a lot.

3040
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,380
We'll just squirt at a time then.

3041
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:05,580
How do I...

3042
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:06,280
Is this empty?

3043
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,420
No, it's not empty.

3044
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,200
How do I put...

3045
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:09,140
One more ice cream.

3046
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:11,220
You have to put it in the wrapper.

3047
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,120
On the bun.

3048
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:14,680
You know what, I want ketchup.

3049
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:15,540
We can do this all by ourselves.

3050
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:16,420
We don't need lives.

3051
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,580
You don't even know how to put mayonnaise on a fucking bun.

3052
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:19,840
Well, I do.

3053
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:21,740
Look, see, watch.

3054
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:24,060
Look at that.

3055
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,480
I did it.

3056
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:26,800
Here you go, Doki.

3057
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,560
Would you eat this burger I just made for you?

3058
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:29,960
No.

3059
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:33,120
Does anybody want this burger I just made?

3060
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:34,280
Would you eat this one?

3061
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:35,220
I will eat your mayonnaise, Mint.

3062
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:35,820
Thank you.

3063
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:39,180
Ew.

3064
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:40,520
Gonna put this here.

3065
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,080
Put food on tray first.

3066
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,780
Fine, hold on.

3067
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:44,600
Sounds kind of sensational.

3068
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,260
Imagine putting 15 squirts of mayonnaise in between these buns and then oiling it up.

3069
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:50,300
You should do it.

3070
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,520
What's stopping you?

3071
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:53,440
I wish we can't order any oil.

3072
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:54,700
I would love to, though.

3073
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:56,220
I would love to see what happens in the fryer.

3074
02:00:56,660 --> 02:01:00,800
Has anyone actually tried the Krabby Patty at Wendy's?

3075
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:03,780
No, because I live in England.

3076
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:05,560
Oh, sorry.

3077
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,520
I was talking to the Americans here.

3078
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:10,500
I was talking to the real people here.

3079
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:16,380
You guys, I'm making the kitchen sink.

3080
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:18,620
You're making the kitchen sink?

3081
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:19,740
That's how you mean.

3082
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:22,060
I mixed all the sodas together.

3083
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:24,660
The classic.

3084
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:26,840
Yeah, somebody's chugging.

3085
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:28,360
You can wait until it gets warm.

3086
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:29,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

3087
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:32,920
That's when it tastes the most flavorful.

3088
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,980
And then you dip your fries into it.

3089
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:35,220
Put it on the grill.

3090
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:36,980
Put it on the grill?

3091
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:37,540
That's true.

3092
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:39,360
Have we ever even had coffee?

3093
02:01:39,580 --> 02:01:40,240
Wait, we can...

3094
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:40,600
Oh, you can't.

3095
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:42,360
Oh, we don't have coffee beans in the grinder.

3096
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:46,940
I was looking forward to making the frothy milk, because it's a funny noise.

3097
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,200
Yeah.

3098
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,040
It's an even better noise if you...

3099
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:51,780
You know what's even...

3100
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:53,140
Okay, I did a...

3101
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:58,220
There's a barista simulator, and it was one of the most stressful simulators I've ever played.

3102
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,540
Because it was incredibly realistic.

3103
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:03,160
It's not realistic, too.

3104
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:08,740
People in the reviews were saying, like, it reminds me of the time when I was a barista, but not the good way.

3105
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:09,260
No.

3106
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:18,600
You actually have to do, like, the step-by-step on how to make the coffee, and, like, the...

3107
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:19,580
And I...

3108
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:21,020
I wanted to cry.

3109
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:21,920
It's an art form.

3110
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:25,440
Please respect it.

3111
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:27,720
Please respect it.

3112
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:30,380
Intrusive thought, did you shove my hand under here?

3113
02:02:30,660 --> 02:02:31,080
Whoa!

3114
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:31,820
Whoa!

3115
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:36,740
Intrusive thought, we should dunk Doki's head into the fryer.

3116
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:37,480
Yeah.

3117
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:38,200
That would be funny.

3118
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,440
We don't have any oil, though.

3119
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:41,480
Yeah, and that's why it's intrusive.

3120
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:46,640
No, we have to do level 10, and I don't know if we want to do two more levels.

3121
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:50,840
Look how beautifully clean these fryers are.

3122
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:51,920
I know, right?

3123
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:53,080
There's no contamination.

3124
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:54,280
Wait, there's contamination?

3125
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:56,880
How do you contaminate it?

3126
02:02:57,740 --> 02:03:01,100
There's an oil waste jug, I assume you have to empty it out every now and again.

3127
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:05,080
But, like, I thought fryers kill off bacteria, because it's too hot.

3128
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:09,160
But maybe you can just, like, dump peanut oil in there, or something, and kill someone, I don't know.

3129
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:13,340
And you have to, like, you have to recycle the grease and filter it.

3130
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:16,180
Oh, wait, how do you know so much about it, Snuffy?

3131
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:21,680
I've worked nothing but these shitty 10-head jobs in my life.

3132
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:22,940
Oh, my God!

3133
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:26,260
Doki, have you never worked fast food?

3134
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,080
No, I've never done fast food before.

3135
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:28,920
Oh, my God.

3136
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:31,760
Wait, how realistic was this game?

3137
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,640
It was pretty realistic, I think.

3138
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:38,080
Hey, Snuffy, is that why you love doing fast food?

3139
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:42,060
I just... I don't know, this just gets me going.

3140
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:46,200
I love systematic things, I love a good burger.

3141
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:51,720
See, this is why I felt like Snuffy would've been the best manager.

3142
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:52,820
Don't you fucking start again.

3143
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:55,580
Oh, my God, have you worked at fast food?

3144
02:03:56,400 --> 02:04:00,220
I've worked first-line support, and it was fucking miserable, but no, not fast food.

3145
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:02,860
Exactly, she has the real-life experiences.

3146
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:05,840
She spent years in the grind.

3147
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:07,160
She deserves it.

3148
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,560
No, you're right.

3149
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:12,040
Limes is the Krusty, and I'm the SpongeBob.

3150
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:12,620
You mean Krabs?

3151
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:15,980
He's not meant for a managerial position.

3152
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:16,840
Who's the Krusty and who's the Krabs?

3153
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:19,080
Yeah, who's the Krusty and who's the Krabs?

3154
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:24,020
Snuffy is the most optimal SpongeBob.

3155
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,680
I just wanna grill a patty.

3156
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:29,020
She is the most optimal, you're right.

3157
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:30,120
Lime is...

3158
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:32,860
I mean, do you want to try one more?

3159
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:35,460
Because it kind of felt like we were collectively having a mental breakdown.

3160
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:37,900
You know what?

3161
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:39,920
I think Snuffy should solo this.

3162
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,120
Snuffy, go!

3163
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:42,900
Snuffy, go!

3164
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:43,700
Go, Snuffy!

3165
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:44,740
Go, Snuffy!

3166
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:46,680
The burgers are so low-to-carb!

3167
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,520
I can't do this without my sloppy crew.

3168
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:50,480
I...

3169
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:52,560
I...

3170
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:58,480
I think Snuffy, in the spirit of sloppy, would be... would... can solo this.

3171
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:00,320
She can solo him.

3172
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,460
I don't think so.

3173
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:06,860
I'm only a cog in the wheel that turns the sloppy machine.

3174
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:10,800
You gotta dream big, Snuffy!

3175
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,600
Holy shit, have you seen the bathrooms here?

3176
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:13,560
They're so big.

3177
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:14,720
Wait, there's bathrooms?

3178
02:05:15,020 --> 02:05:16,500
I scream into the urinal.

3179
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:17,660
I guess you can't.

3180
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:20,820
You have to, like, clean the bathrooms after a while?

3181
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:21,940
Wait, where's the bathroom?

3182
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:26,420
To the... to the, like, right of the restaurant.

3183
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:28,520
Oh my god, put all the patties in the urinals!

3184
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:29,780
Wait, where are you guys?

3185
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:30,960
I'm sorry, but you can't put anything in here.

3186
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:31,640
Oh, there you guys are.

3187
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:31,960
No!

3188
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:33,060
Over there.

3189
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,200
We have...

3190
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,460
What the fuck?

3191
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:35,960
We're a real restaurant.

3192
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:38,210
Why is the bathroom so nice?

3193
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,260
Little tiny... wait, look, look.

3194
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:44,520
Can anybody find... we should play hide and seek.

3195
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:47,150
Can anybody find me?

3196
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:50,440
I'm serious, though.

3197
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:51,140
Can you find me?

3198
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:52,680
Where the fuck... wait.

3199
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:54,480
Oh, wow.

3200
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:56,100
Great hiding spot.

3201
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:04,100
This is... this should not have... this feels way too clean.

3202
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:12,160
We opened a brand new burger joint and it's one of the fanciest, cleanest burger joints in the entire world with the most... the biggest bathrooms ever.

3203
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:14,160
Yeah, and we're called Sloppies.

3204
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,920
It's called Sloppies.

3205
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:17,680
I think Sloppies is a good name for a burger joint.

3206
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:18,680
Wait, we serve salads?

3207
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:21,840
It says famous sauce on the side here.

3208
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,140
Sloppy sauce?

3209
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:26,320
Yeah, the big ones.

3210
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:27,320
Sloppy sauce.

3211
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:29,600
The sloppiest of them all.

3212
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:31,460
Big mac and some sloppy sauce.

3213
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:32,180
Nice.

3214
02:06:32,180 --> 02:06:34,980
I'm pretty sure that's like a stock photo of an actual...

3215
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:35,780
I think this is doable.

3216
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:41,240
This is doable, but I think the same people who are making burgers need to be, like...

3217
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:44,260
So, like, there needs to be, like, two up front and two in the back.

3218
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,460
So to speak.

3219
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:47,100
Yeah, but that's what we had.

3220
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:53,180
I think if we have a system that keeps track of which order we're forming to, just in case we don't...

3221
02:06:53,180 --> 02:06:57,160
Yeah, because once you have two people making the burgers, it's just like, who's doing what now?

3222
02:06:57,580 --> 02:06:57,900
Yeah.

3223
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:02,220
It can't be the big mac.

3224
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:03,860
That's copyrighted.

3225
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:06,260
But we can be, like, the big plap.

3226
02:07:06,820 --> 02:07:07,960
The big slap.

3227
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:10,320
I want to get the big plap with sloppies?

3228
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:11,080
Perfect, yeah.

3229
02:07:11,260 --> 02:07:12,080
Yeah, there we go.

3230
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:14,100
You guys are geniuses at marketing.

3231
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:20,460
You want a big plap meal with extra sloppy sauce on the side?

3232
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:22,580
Oh...

3233
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:27,580
Is that our signature burger?

3234
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:29,980
That's our signature burger, yeah.

3235
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:30,840
The big plap.

3236
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:34,420
It says the big one up there, but we don't...

3237
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:39,520
That's it, the big plap.

3238
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:47,080
Does that mean we have, like, the quarter plaper?

3239
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:48,720
The secret sloppy sauce.

3240
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,280
The quarter plaper?

3241
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:52,080
The quarter plaper?

3242
02:07:52,580 --> 02:07:52,580
No!

3243
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:55,980
Not the quarter flappy!

3244
02:07:57,700 --> 02:08:00,440
The flappy meals, no!

3245
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:25,860
Welcome to Sloppy's.

3246
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:28,460
Welcome to Sloppy's.

3247
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:30,580
Glad to have you here.

3248
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:31,840
Can I take your order?

3249
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:33,880
Uh...

3250
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:36,840
Yes, I'll have a plappy meal with...

3251
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,060
What kind of toy do you have today?

3252
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:47,480
I feel at home behind this counter.

3253
02:08:49,580 --> 02:08:50,880
I don't want to leave.

3254
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:52,540
Really?

3255
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:53,900
Yeah.

3256
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:56,700
What's your favorite memories from Sloppy's?

3257
02:08:56,700 --> 02:08:59,680
Oh my god, I never looked at you guys' faces before.

3258
02:08:59,820 --> 02:09:00,620
This makes it worse.

3259
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:02,860
Everyone looks so bad.

3260
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:06,540
We look like we've been through it.

3261
02:09:06,700 --> 02:09:07,740
Why won't you look happy?

3262
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:09,220
She's the manager.

3263
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:13,440
She doesn't have to do the hard work like us.

3264
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:18,800
Mint looks like she spent the last 30 years outside and didn't apply sunscreen even once.

3265
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:19,960
I did.

3266
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:23,860
Mint looks like a cowboy from, like, 1873.

3267
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:25,580
What do I look like?

3268
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:28,180
You look exactly like Lima.

3269
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:29,280
You look depressed.

3270
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,580
Wait, so I look different from Lima and you?

3271
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:34,180
Because you guys look the same, so I look different from...

3272
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:35,540
Well, no.

3273
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:37,780
It's the same face model.

3274
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,260
They just adjusted the skin tone.

3275
02:09:45,300 --> 02:09:48,000
Are we all the men?

3276
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:49,320
Am I a guy wearing a green shirt?

3277
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:51,360
No, you're a lady.

3278
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,840
It's two ladies, two boys.

3279
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:54,640
What?

3280
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,080
Two ladies?

3281
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:56,820
Yeah, you're a lady.

3282
02:09:57,140 --> 02:09:58,260
I'm a lady?

3283
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,340
Yeah, you're a lady.

3284
02:09:59,820 --> 02:10:01,880
Why did you say I was a cowboy then?

3285
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:04,560
You can be a pretty cowboy.

3286
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:06,900
I'm a pretty cowboy.

3287
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:10,280
Am I a pretty cowboy?

3288
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:13,180
The prettiest.

3289
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:16,600
The prettiest out in the west.

3290
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:24,420
Enjoy avocado, pickles, pepper, always nice fries, premium coffee, family and friends.

3291
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:26,780
What is this fucking word salad shit up here?

3292
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:28,240
Avocado, pickle, pepper.

3293
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,660
Sounds like a pretty cool song.

3294
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:31,180
I thought you were about to rap.

3295
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:32,560
Avocado, pickle, pepper.

3296
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:39,140
This is like the stuff they post randomly on the floor.

3297
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:40,840
So that's not all white.

3298
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:42,560
Is this a porky rap?

3299
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:50,120
You're halfway there.

3300
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:54,120
Do you think everybody walking by just sees us jumping off the chandeliers?

3301
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:57,520
And they're just like...

3302
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,140
We're ransacking the place.

3303
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:03,980
I don't know if I want to be a sloppy master.

3304
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:05,800
A sloppy master.

3305
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:08,580
To be a sloppy master is my destiny.

3306
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,040
I don't know about that.

3307
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:13,040
I flap me and I flap you.

3308
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:13,500
Fuck!

3309
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:22,420
Guys, I think this game broke us a little bit.

3310
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:27,060
This place has been around since 1932.

3311
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:29,860
You guys, we are a stain on this company.

3312
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:37,280
Not everybody has what it takes to open a sloppy franchise, I guess.

3313
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:41,760
Yeah, it takes a lot to be a sloppy franchise owner.

3314
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:46,120
What if we stay open long enough, there's like a Herobrine situation.

3315
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:51,680
The clock hasn't changed since 9pm.

3316
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:54,560
It's like we're in a hyperbolic time chamber.

3317
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:57,420
We're trapped in this...

3318
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:59,600
Nothing has moved on.

3319
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:02,500
It's our eternal purgatory.

3320
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:05,280
Where we keep making sloppy burgers.

3321
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:06,600
Every day.

3322
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:08,320
Every night.

3323
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:09,760
What?

3324
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:12,840
To Snuffy, that's like her heaven right there.

3325
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:15,380
That's like her heaven.

3326
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:17,760
While we're trapped in a purgatory with her.

3327
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:20,920
It's literally the episode where it's like...

3328
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:22,680
Give it up for day 42.

3329
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:29,960
Dave, yeah, day 42.

3330
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:34,500
I love...

3331
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:37,480
So if the cats jump on the counter, they get scared.

3332
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:39,120
Wait, what?

3333
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:40,040
Where are you guys?

3334
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:41,940
Oh, you're there.

3335
02:12:44,440 --> 02:12:45,260
Lime's out here.

3336
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,240
Wait, where did Mint go?

3337
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:48,280
Mint's just in there.

3338
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:51,020
Guys, I had a...

3339
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:53,700
I had a great time with my sloppy employees.

3340
02:12:55,820 --> 02:12:56,780
Team Sloppy.

3341
02:12:58,180 --> 02:12:59,140
Is that...

3342
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:00,720
What even are...

3343
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:03,620
And then a couple people tried to stage a mutiny.

3344
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:05,240
Are we...

3345
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,480
Is that our team name?

3346
02:13:06,740 --> 02:13:07,620
Team Sloppy?

3347
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:11,640
Is that our team name?

3348
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:12,300
Sloppy Squad?

3349
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:13,520
Oh, the Sloppy Squad.

3350
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:15,940
The Sloppy Squad?

3351
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:18,640
We're the Slop Sisters.

3352
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:24,580
Why is our name getting worse?

3353
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:28,480
We could have stopped.

3354
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:29,820
But we...

3355
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,300
The Slop Sisters?

3356
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:36,060
What is this, fucking Hamilton?

3357
02:13:43,090 --> 02:13:44,610
The Sloppy Squad.

3358
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:46,650
I love...

3359
02:13:46,650 --> 02:13:49,290
I want to drink out of the cups really loud like that.

3360
02:13:49,390 --> 02:13:50,470
Slop, Slop, Slop.

3361
02:13:50,570 --> 02:13:51,290
Slop, Slop, Slop.

3362
02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:53,050
Just licking it like a cat.

3363
02:13:54,190 --> 02:13:55,290
Like a dog, really.

3364
02:13:55,870 --> 02:13:56,810
Be specific.

3365
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:56,990
Be specific.

3366
02:13:58,750 --> 02:13:59,610
I was...

3367
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:02,670
I'm so happy to be here with my Sloppy Squad.

3368
02:14:03,890 --> 02:14:04,390
And...

3369
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:06,430
To many more Slops in the future.

3370
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:08,490
Thank you.

3371
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:14,250
I like how I can open this back up again.

3372
02:14:14,410 --> 02:14:16,940
Like someone's gonna just come trundling along at like...

3373
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:18,010
9pm.

3374
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:18,610
That's what Wendy's is for.

3375
02:14:19,930 --> 02:14:21,390
That's what Wendy's are for.

3376
02:14:22,070 --> 02:14:23,870
Always open and ready to serve.

3377
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:25,150
No matter what time.

3378
02:14:25,510 --> 02:14:28,330
I thought, yeah, like 9pm is pretty early.

3379
02:14:28,510 --> 02:14:28,810
I feel like.

3380
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:32,550
I think it's weird for Sloppies to close at 9pm.

3381
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:33,430
Yeah.

3382
02:14:33,770 --> 02:14:35,050
Somebody has a bedtime.

3383
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:36,290
Who is it?

3384
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:39,590
I wonder when you unlock management if you can change that.

3385
02:14:40,610 --> 02:14:41,070
Oh, Jesus.

3386
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:43,130
They do actually have the drive-thru.

3387
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:44,070
It just never happens.

3388
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:47,430
It's like out of prologue thing.

3389
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:48,730
I don't think this...

3390
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:50,950
I don't know if this game will get out of prologue.

3391
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:53,130
Let's...

3392
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:55,910
Wait, do they have to drive all the way around the building to the window?

3393
02:14:56,570 --> 02:14:58,850
Yeah, they have to drive all the way here.

3394
02:14:59,610 --> 02:15:00,310
And then order.

3395
02:15:00,830 --> 02:15:02,830
No, I think you can drive here.

3396
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:04,130
No, it's right here.

3397
02:15:04,190 --> 02:15:05,770
They could do a sick U-turn right here.

3398
02:15:05,850 --> 02:15:06,430
Yeah, right here.

3399
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:08,910
No, it's here.

3400
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:10,130
Drive-thru.

3401
02:15:10,410 --> 02:15:13,130
They drive-thru, do a U-ey, and then...

3402
02:15:13,130 --> 02:15:14,810
Wait, we have Nuggies?

3403
02:15:15,610 --> 02:15:17,710
We have the Plop Nuggies?

3404
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:21,810
If we open a second location, we could call it Sloppy Seconds.

3405
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:30,050
Oh my gosh,

3406
02:15:35,410 --> 02:15:36,210
eventually we'd get...

3407
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:38,610
Our food truck.

3408
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:40,470
Sloppy on Wheels.

3409
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:46,550
That's actually a pretty decent food truck name, not gonna lie.

3410
02:15:46,830 --> 02:15:47,650
Sloppy on Wheels.

3411
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:49,790
Sounds good.

3412
02:15:50,330 --> 02:15:51,610
Get your Sloppy on...

3413
02:15:51,610 --> 02:15:53,370
Get your Slop on the go.

3414
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:54,830
We got a Slop on the go.

3415
02:15:54,830 --> 02:15:56,770
We got to copyright this right now.

3416
02:15:57,090 --> 02:15:58,550
We got to trademark it, guys.

3417
02:15:58,670 --> 02:16:01,170
We can't have them take it.

3418
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:02,770
It'll be the next big thing.

3419
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:07,150
How long until the police show up and we're just a bunch of hoodlums drugged up in the parking lot?

3420
02:16:08,690 --> 02:16:12,350
The police are gonna be like, we got some calls here about some...

3421
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:15,830
We're just banging on the drive-thru window.

3422
02:16:15,830 --> 02:16:17,990
Just like bobbling up and down.

3423
02:16:18,550 --> 02:16:20,090
We're all just screaming Sloppy.

3424
02:16:20,290 --> 02:16:21,670
Did we make anybody?

3425
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:23,390
No.

3426
02:16:23,570 --> 02:16:25,670
Only $74 is what we lost.

3427
02:16:25,730 --> 02:16:26,530
That's not bad.

3428
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:31,030
We got minus 205 popularity for opening up and just sitting here all day.

3429
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:32,090
That might be a good thing though.

3430
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:35,390
Please don't open the door.

3431
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:36,770
Please don't.

3432
02:16:37,050 --> 02:16:38,650
Stop doing it.

3433
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:42,190
Don't do it.

3434
02:16:42,210 --> 02:16:45,590
Please stop being Sloppy without the Sloppy sister.

3435
02:16:47,410 --> 02:16:47,690
Don't.

3436
02:16:47,790 --> 02:16:48,210
Stop.

3437
02:16:48,470 --> 02:16:49,030
Don't.

3438
02:16:49,370 --> 02:16:51,610
Please have mercy on us.

3439
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:55,890
I think we gotta sell the franchise before it goes bunk.

3440
02:16:55,970 --> 02:16:56,830
Do you sell high?

3441
02:16:57,490 --> 02:16:57,890
Oh, true.

3442
02:16:58,010 --> 02:16:58,450
Sell high.

3443
02:16:58,710 --> 02:17:00,530
I don't think there's any high here.

3444
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:02,630
We failed in every metric.

3445
02:17:03,050 --> 02:17:04,950
We still have a positive rating.

3446
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:06,170
Yeah, we're level 8.

3447
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:07,530
Look, see?

3448
02:17:08,270 --> 02:17:09,890
They're just content with us.

3449
02:17:09,990 --> 02:17:12,370
They're not Disappointed.

3450
02:17:12,930 --> 02:17:13,450
I don't think that's a content face.

3451
02:17:13,710 --> 02:17:15,110
They look like an Arby's.

3452
02:17:15,570 --> 02:17:18,030
I have an idea.

3453
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:19,590
You guys, we climb that mountain.

3454
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:21,050
Cause an avalanche.

3455
02:17:21,590 --> 02:17:22,590
And then we collect the insurance.

3456
02:17:22,590 --> 02:17:23,310
Can we do it?

3457
02:17:26,370 --> 02:17:27,550
There's an invisible wall.

3458
02:17:27,550 --> 02:17:30,610
I don't think they've implemented the insurance part of the game.

3459
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:38,670
I think we could dig like a crevasse underneath the building of Sloppies and then it'll cave in and we can blame it on natural causes.

3460
02:17:38,890 --> 02:17:39,450
Oh, that's true.

3461
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:41,330
Wait until there's a rainstorm.

3462
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:42,570
And then do all that.

3463
02:17:42,730 --> 02:17:43,950
We'll never know.

3464
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:45,570
We got a sinkhole under Sloppies.

3465
02:17:46,710 --> 02:17:52,310
It's like that lady on TikTok that made like an underground mine before she got shut down.

3466
02:17:54,950 --> 02:17:56,370
We can hire her.

3467
02:17:56,810 --> 02:17:57,650
We can hire her.

3468
02:17:57,750 --> 02:17:59,790
She still wants to make that mine.

3469
02:18:01,150 --> 02:18:02,870
Make the sloppy sinkhole.

3470
02:18:03,190 --> 02:18:04,070
And then we will be good.

3471
02:18:04,070 --> 02:18:05,070
Sloppy hole.

3472
02:18:08,910 --> 02:18:09,670
Trademark that.

3473
02:18:10,610 --> 02:18:12,350
Manager, you should trademark that.

3474
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:14,190
So they don't steal our idea.

3475
02:18:19,050 --> 02:18:23,670
I'm gonna miss all the memories we have here before we burn this place down.

3476
02:18:24,630 --> 02:18:26,870
Sloppy sinkhole was just my name in college.

3477
02:18:27,110 --> 02:18:28,350
I can't trademark that.

3478
02:18:31,150 --> 02:18:34,190
I need to go get something to eat.

3479
02:18:34,690 --> 02:18:36,070
Get cheese.

3480
02:18:36,450 --> 02:18:38,470
Guess we better open the restaurant.

3481
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:42,670
Shut it down!

3482
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:44,110
Shut the server down!

3483
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:46,290
Shut the server down!

3484
02:18:46,670 --> 02:18:47,870
Let's go!

3485
02:18:48,090 --> 02:18:48,310
Quit!

3486
02:18:50,390 --> 02:18:51,810
I just can't pass that.

3487
02:18:52,630 --> 02:18:53,370
Sloppy!

3488
02:18:54,470 --> 02:18:55,210
No!

3489
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:56,090
Sloppy!

3490
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:56,510
Sloppy!

3491
02:18:56,510 --> 02:18:57,950
No more sloppies.

3492
02:18:59,690 --> 02:19:01,090
Sloppies is dead forever.

3493
02:19:01,530 --> 02:19:05,750
I hope there's an update where you can dress up as the mascot and stand outside.

3494
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:10,030
And do the sign twirls and everything.

3495
02:19:11,390 --> 02:19:12,550
It's like a rhythm game.

3496
02:19:13,790 --> 02:19:16,330
You're just playing a different game from us.

3497
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:21,810
We need extra hands back here.

3498
02:19:21,890 --> 02:19:22,750
There's too many ladies.

3499
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:24,410
And you're just playing like...

3500
02:19:25,470 --> 02:19:27,050
You're just playing osu!

3501
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:36,530
We just hear the clickety-clack of the keyboard and being like, please!

3502
02:19:36,730 --> 02:19:38,870
We need somebody to bring these orders in!

3503
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:41,170
And you're just like osu-ing it up on your screen.

3504
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:47,720
Well, that was fun, guys.

3505
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:52,380
I had a great time with all of you guys.

3506
02:19:52,380 --> 02:19:54,380
I had a very good time.

3507
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:55,660
Yeah, no problem.

3508
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:58,480
By the way, guys, it was this...

3509
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:02,580
It has not even out yet!

3510
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:04,440
What do you mean?!

3511
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:10,340
I like how different that was compared to Shopkeeper Sim is kind of...

3512
02:20:10,960 --> 02:20:14,720
There's stuff to do, but it's still mostly chill for a lot of levels.

3513
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:18,140
Whereas that game was just like, oh, you unlocked something more than one ingredient?

3514
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:19,300
Go fuck yourself!

3515
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:26,500
Yeah, it's actually very, very accurate to the real thing.

3516
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:31,760
It was like Overcooked if Overcooked had no appealing art style whatsoever.

3517
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:37,740
Honestly, I think this was much more difficult than Overcooked.

3518
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:46,920
Oh my god, someone just in my chat was just like, I played this stream over the speaker in the kitchen and we were laughing.

3519
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:52,780
We were like, they know our pain!

3520
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:01,300
Oh my god.

3521
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:08,400
But I'm glad that I was able to open a fast food restaurant with all of you guys, the Sloppy Squad.

3522
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:12,200
One day Sloppies will ride again.

3523
02:21:12,580 --> 02:21:14,920
One day we'll bring back...

3524
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:17,040
Sloppies will come back, guys.

3525
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:23,880
What if we had like a cafe collab and it was just Sloppies?

3526
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:25,000
Oh my god.

3527
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:30,420
Whenever we do any kind of food, it's always Sloppies.

3528
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:37,280
Our cafe collab is just literally Sloppies and themed around...

3529
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:40,580
Literally, we're just doing Papa's Pizzeria, Freezeria.

3530
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:40,780
Literally.

3531
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:45,680
So Sloppies under different circumstances.

3532
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:46,820
This is Sloppies Dessert.

3533
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:51,080
Okay, maybe not.

3534
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:55,760
I mean, cha-ching.

3535
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:57,380
Sloppies Sweets.

3536
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:01,220
Everybody would want a part of Sloppies.

3537
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:03,260
Who's everybody?

3538
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:05,240
Sloppies Crack.

3539
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:05,960
No.

3540
02:22:12,020 --> 02:22:13,000
Oh my god.

3541
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:16,740
But thank you everyone for doing another collab again.

3542
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,780
It was really fun.

3543
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:20,620
Thank you for inviting.

3544
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:23,060
It's always fun with you guys, thank you.

3545
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:24,920
Yeah, it was always so fun.

3546
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:31,400
I feel like next time we should just hang out and talk on stream, because I feel like...

3547
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:37,120
Maybe we can think of something that we can play like in the background really like idly, if anything.

3548
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:37,920
Yeah.

3549
02:22:38,660 --> 02:22:43,940
Something that you can play maybe involving fishing with your friends on the web.

3550
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:44,580
I don't know.

3551
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:48,000
What was it?

3552
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:50,140
The wee fishing or whatever?

3553
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:51,380
Yeah, web fishing.

3554
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:53,420
I was playing it yesterday.

3555
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:54,820
It's really chill.

3556
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:57,100
You should try it.

3557
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:58,280
It's actually really chill.

3558
02:22:58,940 --> 02:22:59,200
Is it fun?

3559
02:22:59,360 --> 02:22:59,460
Okay.

3560
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:05,360
It's basically like Animal Crossing fishing, but they remove everything else and it's just fishing.

3561
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,340
It's just a fishing part of Animal Crossing.

3562
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:11,460
So you can like shitpost at your friends at the same time.

3563
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:17,540
Do you guys do like any VR collabs?

3564
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:19,320
Oh, we should do...

That was fun!

3600
02:24:28,460 --> 02:24:29,760
That was fun!

3601
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:32,260
But also not fun because it felt too real.

3602
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:33,560
But like, that was fun!

3603
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:37,160
I think just because I was with the sloppy... oh my god.

3604
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:40,120
I wish we weren't called that.

3605
02:24:41,020 --> 02:24:43,340
Just because I was with the sloppy squad.

3606
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:45,500
I had a great time.

3607
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:57,600
Anyway guys, I really want to stick around a lot longer, but like I have to pick up groceries because they called me and now I'm worried that they are going to drive away.

3608
02:24:58,120 --> 02:24:58,480
So...

3609
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,520
I need to go downstairs and pick up my groceries.

3610
02:25:03,860 --> 02:25:09,120
Anyway guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated, fast, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3611
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:12,620
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

3612
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:13,880
Guys, I need to pick up my groceries.

3613
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:14,960
I'm scared they drive away.

3614
02:25:15,340 --> 02:25:16,460
I'll see you guys later everybody!

3615
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:17,220
Bye guys!

3616
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:17,620
Bye!

3617
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:18,580
They called me.

3618
02:25:18,700 --> 02:25:19,260
I'm scared.

3619
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:22,680
They called me like two minutes ago and I didn't pick up because I was like, but I want to talk.

Anyway, bye-bye!
