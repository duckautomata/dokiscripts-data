1
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,860
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,220
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,380
Oh my God, I sound... I'm like, every day is an improvement for my voice.

4
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,080
Every day I'm like, oh my God, I sound so much... Yes, yes, I have eye bags right now, because this is how I feel every day.

5
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,580
This is how I feel every day last half year.

6
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,820
I felt like, you know, gotta be true to myself, guys.

7
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,680
Like, I gotta be true to myself.

8
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,980
But yeah, sorry, I'm a little late, because I thought I had everything tested out.

9
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,140
I thought everything was good.

10
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,780
And then, like, I was like, wait, why can't I stream it?

11
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,540
Like, why wouldn't it show up on my OBS?

12
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,660
But I forgot, because it's an old game.

13
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,660
This is a modded game.

14
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,580
By the way, they modded this so that you could play it now on Windows 11.

15
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,480
But yeah, the perks of being an indie.

16
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,980
Like, oh, did you ask perms for this?

17
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,180
What perms?

18
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,940
This is abandonware.

19
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,960
Like, the game is practically abandonware right now.

20
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,640
Next scene, thank you for the super chat.

21
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,660
Thank you, thank you.

22
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,480
Yeah, this is my default now.

23
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,440
This is actually how I feel inside and outside.

24
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:06,600
But yes, like, just like, I don't know if you guys remember, but like a lot of older games, you need to run it through admin only...

25
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,720
to be able to stream such games.

26
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,800
But this one, there's a lot.

27
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,300
I was like, this one, the thing is, it has its own special launcher to be able to play this game.

28
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,720
Because it is like, like the community modded this game to be able to play now.

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:31,400
Because apparently, apparently, because this game was made by EA, but EA was never going to pay.

30
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,880
I don't know, not, maybe not never, but like at its current time, they weren't going to pay for the rights to re-release this game, like remaster it or whatever.

31
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:48,920
So, to be able to play the Battle of Middle-Earth, you have to be, the community modded the game to be able to play online.

32
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,280
And so, that's how I've been able to play.

33
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,900
Because I tweeted, I mean like, I miss Battle of Middle-Earth.

34
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,220
And then people like linked me to a bunch of posts on how you could play it now.

35
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,560
So yeah, thank you to all the Dragoons that linked it to me.

36
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,860
I would have known that you could actually play this game now.

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,700
But yeah, I'm really excited.

38
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,260
Apparently online works as well, but I'm going to be playing the campaign mode.

39
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:23,600
And we're going to do the evil campaign, because I honestly enjoyed, I don't know, every time I play, like for some reason, I really enjoy the evil characters when I play RTS games.

40
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,260
Because I feel like the character designs and like the troops and everything is just so much better.

41
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,240
It just looks nicer.

42
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,720
And it's much more, the story, I like the story a lot more.

43
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,380
I like the story a lot more.

44
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,940
I like the troop designs a lot more.

45
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,960
I just love controlling the evil, like bad guys more than the good guys.

46
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,300
Because like the good guys, you get elves, you get elves, dwarves, humans.

47
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,120
But they're just all different flavors of like human.

48
00:04:50,120 --> 00:05:01,460
So if you think about it, elves, dwarves, humans, it's like small human, small human, human with pointy ears, and then human.

49
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,560
But so it's like, it's so boring.

50
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,440
I just, and then, but then, you know, I guess you also have the trees too.

51
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,280
But like, you know, I fucking hate the trees because of Groot.

52
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,200
Don't compare dwarves with knife ears.

53
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,140
How dare you?

54
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,140
It's just, it's just different flavors of human features.

55
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,340
So like, or the hob, you know, or small, or even smaller human.

56
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,200
So it's like hobbits, the smallest human.

57
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,000
Then dwarves, the like medium-sized human.

58
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,020
Human, human size.

59
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,040
Then elves, taller, tall humans with knife ears.

60
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,300
So it's like, and then tree guy.

61
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,360
And then tree men.

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,000
So like, I always find the troops like incredibly boring to play as.

63
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,480
So that's why I always play the, like my go-to has always been like the evil campaign.

64
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,500
And like, and like just playing the evil characters.

65
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,080
Cause it's like, I feel like the designs are a lot cooler.

66
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,560
Like we get like, like goblins on dogs.

67
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,760
Like they ride on dogs and stuff like that.

68
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,860
And then we get dragons and everything.

69
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,480
So, yeah, exactly.

70
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,540
Lord Kuro says, thank you for the super chat.

71
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,380
Thank you, thank you.

72
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,980
Imagine getting to choose what you are in a fantasy setting and you choose to be a human.

73
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
Holy fuck.

74
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,800
Okay, I didn't mean like that, but okay.

75
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,980
Thank you for the super chat.

76
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,060
Thank you, thank you.

77
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,840
Yabby, thank you for the super chat.

78
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,560
Thank you, thank you.

79
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,540
Toki, I've called Marvel rivalitis.

80
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,940
Please see a doctor.

81
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,080
Thank you for the super chat.

82
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,120
Thank you, thank you.

83
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,800
Imagination, thank you for the super chat.

84
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,180
Thank you, thank you.

85
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,900
A sequel is even better.

86
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,960
Yeah, I was debating if I want to play Battle Metal 2 or the first one.

87
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,060
But I figured since like, you know, I figured I'd try to go with the first one.

88
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,540
Since it's like the first one in the installment.

89
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,260
And it's the one that got me really into the game at first.

90
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,560
By the way, so I'll tell you about my history of Lord Rings.

91
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
Lord Rings looks like racism.

92
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,360
Guys, L's aren't real.

93
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,380
And so are dwarves.

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,180
Dwarves aren't real at all.

95
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,640
They're not real.

96
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,880
Anyway, they aren't real to me.

97
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,060
How can you be racist to a thing that doesn't exist?

98
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,800
I wasn't even the one that blinded Knife Ears.

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,160
I was just reading off of chat.

100
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,220
I was just reading off of chat.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,900
I wasn't even the one that suggested Knife Ears.

102
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,240
I was just saying the good side is just boring to play as.

103
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,500
Not so deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

104
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,840
Thank you, thank you.

105
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,280
L's and dwarves are just fantasy meters and we don't know how you feel about those people.

106
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,280
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

107
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,600
Okay, don't keep saying slurs on stream now.

108
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,760
Anyway, anyway.

109
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
Okay, so a lot of people know.

110
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,600
Some of you guys might know about my history with Lord of the Rings.

111
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,640
So, I actually didn't really grow up with Lord of the Rings.

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,600
I'm not a Lord of the Rings fan, but I loved Battle of Middle-Earth.

113
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,080
And I loved the RTS, Battle of Middle-Earth 1 and 2.

114
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,360
And I never actually played the Wraith game.

115
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,660
I never played that one because by the time that game came out, it was too late for me.

116
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,460
I think by the time that game came out, for some reason, I didn't play it.

117
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,700
My dad never bought it, so I never was able to...

118
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,680
Rise of the Witch King, yeah, Rise of the Witch King.

119
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,720
I never got a chance to play it because my dad never bought it.

120
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,480
So, the only reason why I was able to play those games was they were hand-me-downs from my dad.

121
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,700
So, my dad loves Lord of the Rings.

122
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,560
Like, he was obsessed with the entire franchise of Lord of the Rings.

123
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,280
So, he watched all the movies, he played all the games.

124
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,720
He dragged me to watch the second Hobbit movie.

125
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,460
I didn't watch the first one because I was just like...

126
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,220
I wasn't really that interested.

127
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,980
The one with Smaug or whatever his name...

128
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,680
Is it Smaug?

129
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,100
Is he in the first or second...

130
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,160
No, he was in the second one.

131
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,580
He dragged me to watch the Smaug one, but I never watched the first one.

132
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,840
But he dragged me to watch that one.

133
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,560
And then the third one, he asked me if I wanted to watch it.

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,400
I was like, no, it's alright.

135
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,980
But basically, my dad was obsessed with the entire franchise.

136
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,560
He owns all the behind-the-scenes DVDs of the Lord of the Rings and everything.

137
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,240
And then he tried to drag...

138
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,760
And he went to theaters to watch the Lord of the Rings movies and everything.

139
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,440
And he loved the franchise.

140
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,320
And because he loved the franchise, he also loved the games too.

141
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,300
So he gave me the hand-me-downs of the RTS Lord of the Rings games to play when I was little.

142
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,980
But I only was able to play one and two.

143
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,400
And that's why I think that those...

144
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,280
I think my favorite RTS games of all time has to be Battle on Middle-Earth and StarCraft.

145
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,960
Like StarCraft, my favorite race to use has to be the Zerg.

146
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,600
Because I'm always interested in...

147
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,440
I've always thought the Zerg designs were much more interesting.

148
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,280
And the Zerg troops were much more interesting than the Protoss and the fucking humans.

149
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,920
And I think their lore and story is so much more interesting too.

150
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,300
Protoss was just way too...

151
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,100
The Protoss lore and story was just too...

152
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,120
How do I say it?

153
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,800
What's the proper word for it?

154
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,380
It's just too snobby for me.

155
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,360
I don't know.

156
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,960
I feel like the Protoss story was way too...

157
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm trying to think of a word for it.

158
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,100
A good...

159
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,420
Pretentious.

160
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,640
Yeah, that's a good word.

161
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,440
I just thought Protoss was really pretentious.

162
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,680
And then humans were just humans.

163
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,100
Yeah, they're literally just space elves.

164
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,460
If you think about it.

165
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,720
They're like space elves.

166
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,720
And I always thought the Zerglings...

167
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,160
The Zerg story was just much more interesting.

168
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,980
And the same with Battle of Middle-Earth.

169
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,400
I just thought the evil campaign was just more interesting than the good campaign.

170
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,420
Because it's like the other side of Lord of the Rings.

171
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,660
You're always following the good guys.

172
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,380
So this time you get to follow the bad guys.

173
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,720
And it's like a what-if situation.

174
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,900
Oh, what if the bad guys just win it all?

175
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,720
What if Soran just won?

176
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,820
I was like, that's a cool idea.

177
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,820
That's pretty neat.

178
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,940
I was like, yeah.

179
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,900
What if Soran just win it all?

180
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,020
The bad guys deserve to win sometime.

181
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,720
So I always thought like...

182
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,300
I thought it was interesting.

183
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,220
I just thought the story was just much more interesting.

184
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,780
Anyway, I don't remember much about the campaign.

185
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,640
Because it's been like...

186
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,320
Yeah, what if he was just misunderstood?

187
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,440
You guys don't know.

188
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,760
He might have been just a misunderstood guy.

189
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,340
You guys don't know that.

190
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,940
We're gonna play his story.

191
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,660
Simpleminded, thank you for the super chat.

192
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,640
Thank you, thank you.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,880
Man, the new Doki situation is crazy.

194
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,460
You think you have learned from last time.

195
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,900
Thank you for the super chat.

196
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,360
Thank you, thank you.

197
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,780
Ryan, I have a protest against this racist streamer.

198
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,680
Report it.

199
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,680
Spoken like a true space elf.

200
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,040
Thank you for the super chat, Ryan.

201
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,560
Thank you, thank you.

202
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,160
Anton, how could you?

203
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,400
Terrans aren't just humans.

204
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,860
They're a space trucker.

205
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,280
Oh, yeah, brother.

206
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,960
Hit that dead rock, Terran1.

207
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,960
Thank you for the super chat, Anton.

208
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,320
Thank you, thank you.

209
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,080
What?

210
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,920
Alright, the dwarves were right.

211
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,180
Darkblade.

212
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,060
Thank you for the super chat.

213
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,060
Thank you, thank you.

214
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,940
Miss Doki Bird, I need to know.

215
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,120
Did you see the trailer leak of the cancelled CW Powerpuff Girls show?

216
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,060
I remember you talked about the script leak.

217
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Yes, I have!

218
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:50,820
For those who didn't know, I remember I always said, I wish they would just leak the cancelled Powerpuff Girls show.

219
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,380
And someone finally leaked it.

220
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,340
I was like, oh, man.

221
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,480
I wish one day...

222
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:05,340
I can't believe we live at a time where someone actually leaked the Powerpuff Girls live-action CW show.

223
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,600
I wish this show actually came out.

224
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,520
I would have hate-watched the shit out of it.

225
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,760
It's so bad, but so fun.

226
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,640
It's like funny bad, though.

227
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,440
Like, I know all you guys are like, this is fucking terrible.

228
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,720
But it is funny bad.

229
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,460
It looks like a fucking train wreck that I would absolutely watch and consume.

230
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,940
Because I watched Supernatural when it got bad bad.

231
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,800
I fucking ate that shit.

232
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,700
Supernatural at one point was good.

233
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,780
But then it got bad bad.

234
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,740
And I still... I did stop at one point because it went...

235
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,420
And I watched Riverdale too.

236
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,380
The thing is, I watch trashy shows.

237
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,920
And it looked like another...

238
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,280
Like, it looked like Riverdale as well.

239
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,580
And I was like, oh my god.

240
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,180
This could have been my next Riverdale.

241
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,260
This legit...

242
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,480
It looked so good.

243
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,600
It could have...

244
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,260
It would have been my pre-Riverdale if I was able to...

245
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,920
Oh, no.

246
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,820
They copyright striked it.

247
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,560
No way.

248
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,140
Oh my god.

249
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,960
Somebody...

250
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,360
Oh, I was gonna show you guys a link.

251
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,740
They actually...

252
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,020
Someone must have it.

253
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,160
Oh my god.

254
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm gonna see if I can find it.

255
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,680
I'm gonna try to see if I can find it.

256
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,360
But they actually...

257
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,080
They copyright striked it.

258
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,000
I can't believe it.

259
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,800
It's actually gone.

260
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:34,800
Wait.

261
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,520
Let's see if there's the...

262
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,180
I'm gonna see.

263
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,620
There was a long trailer too.

264
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,480
It was like fucking a long ass trailer.

265
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,580
I was surprised with how long that trailer was when I was watching.

266
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,780
I was like, it's still going?

267
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,060
Oh my god.

268
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,120
Jokey, you definitely should have played Warhammer 40,000, your favorite video game of that franchise.

269
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,880
Just listening to you.

270
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,780
Joel, thank you for the Akka Super.

271
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,380
Thank you, thank you.

272
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,680
Wait, there was...

273
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,680
Imagina, thank you for the Magenta Super.

274
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,580
Thank you, thank you.

275
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,520
Starcraft Brood War.

276
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,060
Starcraft 2 this year then?

277
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,300
I mean, it was a charity goal.

278
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,060
So, definitely for sure this year.

279
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,720
Best, thank you for the Magenta Super.

280
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,460
Thank you, thank you.

281
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,140
It's still on Reddit?

282
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,580
Okay.

283
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,620
Alright guys.

284
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,800
I'll see if I can find it.

285
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
I'll link you guys this before we play the game.

286
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,780
But I was just like, I can't believe we live...

287
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,020
It's 2025 and someone actually leaked it.

288
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,600
I can't...

289
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,620
It was real.

290
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,680
I thought we would never see it.

291
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I never thought we live in a time where the show actually got...

292
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,640
It's so fucking...

293
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,560
Oh my god.

294
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,360
I...

295
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,260
It's actually funny.

296
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,000
I got it.

297
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,160
I got it.

298
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:52,720
Alright.

299
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,340
For those who want to watch it.

300
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,380
Oh my...

301
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:56,900
Like...

302
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,300
Oh my god.

303
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,520
Okay.

304
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,220
My favorite part...

305
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay, so like...

306
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,040
Spoilers.

307
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,460
So like, the thing is...

308
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,400
Mojo Jojo isn't a monkey anymore.

309
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
It's like a son and a father.

310
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,980
So like, the dad's name is Mojo.

311
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,180
And the son's name is Jojo.

312
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,080
And then...

313
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,680
And then they're trying to say that Jojo and Blossom were gonna fall in love or some shit.

314
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,000
I was just like, why?

315
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,760
Why is it Mojo and Jojo?

316
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,920
And then also...

317
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,080
Also, so like, they all like split up.

318
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,520
And then Buttercup became a firefighter.

319
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,020
And she's like, I'm a real hero now.

320
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,940
I was like...

321
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,720
You were an actual superhero that saved the world.

322
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,260
What the fuck do you mean?

323
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,000
You could have done that as a superhero.

324
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,460
You don't need to be a firefighter to be a hero.

325
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,020
You could have been a superhero that stopped fires.

326
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,300
Like, you don't have to be a firefighter.

327
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,040
You have superpowers.

328
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,400
So, yeah.

329
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,300
And then like...

330
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,980
And then Bubbles became like...

331
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,460
Like, tried to go to Hollywood.

332
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
But like, she couldn't make it.

333
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,420
And then it implied that she's like...

334
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,860
Like, I don't know.

335
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,520
A hooker?

336
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,380
I don't fucking know.

337
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,700
It implied that she's like doing something in Hollywood.

338
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,420
I have no idea.

339
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,040
And then, I don't remember what Blossom was doing.

340
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,420
Yeah, I know.

341
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,590
And then like...

342
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,350
Yeah, so like...

343
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,430
Yeah, so...

344
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,890
And I don't know what the fuck Blossom is doing.

345
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,290
Like, I don't know.

346
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,330
She's just there.

347
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,230
What am I yapping about?

348
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,950
The cancelled CW Powerpuff Girls show.

349
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,690
I wish...

350
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,510
I wish they could release the entire...

351
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:01,850
And then they're implying that the Powerpuff Girls show cartoon is based off of them.

352
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,670
Because like, they were superheroes that like...

353
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,230
That has like an entire like franchise built off of them.

354
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,400
So, and then like...

355
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,330
Okay.

356
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,950
This line like fucking cracked me up.

357
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,150
Because I was like...

358
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,190
Because they were...

359
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,630
Okay, it's so fucked up.

360
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,390
They were implying that the live action show...

361
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,590
Like, in the script...

362
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,610
The script, Buttercup was like...

363
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,310
Yeah, the Powerpuff Girls cartoon show whitewashed us.

364
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,510
And I was like...

365
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,930
Why would you write that bitch cartoon show?

366
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,990
Oh my god.

367
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,150
I was like...

368
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,910
That is insane.

369
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,270
That is actually insane.

370
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,710
That you would write that line for a beloved cartoon show.

371
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,290
That like started everything.

372
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,270
Oh my god.

373
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,410
Oh my god.

374
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,530
I was like...

375
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,830
Holy fuck.

376
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,410
Why are you trash talking the original cartoon?

377
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,730
That's absolutely crazy.

378
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,070
I wish this show didn't get cancelled.

379
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,930
I would have watched this.

380
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,050
I would have made you guys watch this.

381
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,490
It is so bad funny.

382
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,830
Like, from the trailer alone...

383
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,010
By the way...

384
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,390
The show...

385
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,890
The time of the show when this was written...

386
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,950
Was when Tumblr was still a thing.

387
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,350
Because I remember when I was on Tumblr...

388
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,850
That people were talking about the live action Powerpuff Girls show.

389
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:57,110
And I could tell that this was very geared towards Tumblr women.

390
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,270
Just from this...

391
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,570
It was like when Tumblr was still around...

392
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,590
This show was being filmed and written.

393
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,890
Because I was there on Tumblr when they were talking about this.

394
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:23,120
I fucking...

395
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,800
Oh man.

396
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,400
This would have been my pre-Riverdale, guys.

397
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,560
This actually would have been my pre...

398
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,960
I wish they brought it back.

399
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,300
I wish somebody would just leak the entire fucking...

400
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,980
Like, all the episodes right there.

401
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,620
It was made for me.

402
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,060
This show was made for me to watch.

403
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,200
To watch and like...

404
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,440
To hate watch.

405
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,190
I linked the trailer for anyone that wanted to watch it.

406
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,250
Anyway...

407
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,030
Thank you for the super chat.

408
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,910
Thank you, thank you.

409
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,930
Rings of Power.

410
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,210
Basically gave Middle Earth the CW treatment.

411
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,630
But you have to know the books to truly appreciate how awful it is.

412
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,090
Sorry, I'm a Tolkien fan.

413
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,230
Thank you for the super chat.

414
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,270
Thank you, thank you.

415
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,950
Anton.

416
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,390
Petitioned to add bad CW shows to members' watch logs.

417
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,550
Thank you for the super chat.

418
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,590
Thank you, thank you.

419
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,210
OmniStar.

420
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,530
Thank you for your very first super chat.

421
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,510
Thank you, thank you.

422
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,110
Balfour Miller came out in 2004.

423
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,950
I was 11.

424
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,750
Man, I feel old.

425
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,030
I grew up on the game and the 3rd Age Total War mod for Medieval 2 Total War.

426
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,750
Great memories and led me to play Dungeons & Dragons.

427
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,310
Thank you for the super chat.

428
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,290
Thank you, thank you.

429
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,310
Oh my god.

430
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,670
But yeah, thank you for your very first super chat.

431
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,470
Anyway, enough about the Powerpuff Girls.

432
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,190
Let's actually play the game.

433
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,750
So apparently, this is like...

434
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,290
The HD mod.

435
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:47,950
Oh, wait.

436
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,050
Why is it not...

437
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,450
Wait, why is it not showing anymore?

438
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,230
Wait, it worked before.

439
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:54,370
Excuse me?

440
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,610
Oh no.

441
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,170
Oh no.

442
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,230
Wait a minute.

443
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,570
Oh no.

444
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,130
It was working.

445
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,050
It showed up on my OBS.

446
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,610
Oh no, I talked too long.

447
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,050
I talked too long.

448
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,750
Okay, let me...

449
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,370
Let me reload.

450
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,530
Let me reboot this.

451
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,590
Maybe if I reboot it, it'll work.

452
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,930
At least because I tabbed out.

453
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,150
Maybe that's why.

454
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,550
Okay, don't worry guys.

455
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,530
I figured it out.

456
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,690
Guys, don't worry.

457
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,850
I know how to do this.

458
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,950
I figured it out.

459
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,850
Run as admin.

460
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,630
There we go.

461
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,430
This was...

462
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,230
Yeah, my...

463
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,910
Too much Powerpuff Girls.

464
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,950
The game was like, stop.

465
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,210
Yeah, I guess we can't tab out, guys.

466
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,690
We can't tab out.

467
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,230
Alright, here we go.

468
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,070
Options.

469
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,250
Let me know...

470
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,750
Sound guy, if you're alive.

471
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,890
Let me know if everything's okay.

472
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,370
Let's do...

473
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,110
Yeah, let's do ultra.

474
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,950
I don't know.

475
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,490
Let's do with the movie up.

476
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,810
I feel like movie and voice is...

477
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,470
Alright, let's put these up.

478
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,850
I feel like these are always have to go.

479
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:04,710
Woah!

480
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,850
I legitimately don't remember this game much.

481
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,510
I just remember controlling the units.

482
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,050
Alright.

483
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,250
Campaign.

484
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,470
Evil.

485
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,410
Let's do medium.

486
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,490
We're not pussies.

487
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,150
But like, we are a little bit...

488
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,470
But we're not like, good enough for hard yet.

489
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,090
I don't remember this game as much.

490
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,030
Alright.

491
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,470
Where are we?

492
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,090
Guys, I need you guys to know that like...

493
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,210
I am not very well versed in the Lord of the Rings lore.

494
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,350
A lot of things I know was reading the Lord of the Rings Wikipedia.

495
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,610
And also Battle of Middle-Earth.

496
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,440
That's...

497
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:46,880
Woah.

498
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,380
Let's get that one ring back.

499
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,640
And they're taking the hobbits to Isengard.

500
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,580
Isengard.

501
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,240
Isengard.

502
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,160
They're taking the hobbits to Isengard.

503
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,780
Taking what?

504
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,700
They're taking the hobbits to Isengard.

505
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,920
Isengard.

506
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,960
No subs.

507
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,360
Ooh, Christopher Lee.

508
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,740
Alright.

509
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,400
Okay, so...

510
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,400
Let us...

511
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,260
Fix the audio real quick.

512
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,120
What was it?

513
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,000
So, let's get the voices...

514
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,720
Alright, so apparently...

515
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,260
There's no subtitles.

516
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,480
Back then...

517
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,780
Games usually did not have subtitles.

518
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,820
Because games back then...

519
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,020
They were like, fuck you guys.

520
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,200
Why do you need to read?

521
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,020
Like...

522
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,880
They prefer not giving us subtitles back then.

523
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,460
Because they think we don't need to read.

524
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,900
We just need to listen.

525
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,840
Back then.

526
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,240
Okay, we're turning the music down.

527
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,440
And the sound effects down.

528
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,960
And that should be good.

529
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,080
Alright, sound guy.

530
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,920
Is everything good?

531
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,320
Gamers don't need to read.

532
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,700
That's how they thought back then.

533
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,540
Alright.

534
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,280
Let's go.

535
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,800
You don't need to understand Lord of the Rings lore to roll Middle-Earth Queen.

536
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,880
Tokid Save.

537
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,880
Thank you for the super chat.

538
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,720
Thank you.

539
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,620
Me!

540
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm the new master.

541
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,700
That's me!

542
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,510
Oh, I forgot to accept changes.

543
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:27,870
Oops.

544
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,490
Oh my god.

545
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,270
You can tell how old this game is.

546
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,890
The cinematics.

547
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,170
Rosie, thank you for the super chat.

548
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,450
Thank you.

549
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,270
I owned this and haven't touched it.

550
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,790
I'm so happy to watch you play.

551
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,030
Oh my god.

552
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:45,710
This...

553
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:45,930
Woah.

554
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,430
Okay, there's grandma.

555
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,530
There's sorrow man.

556
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,050
Okay, I need to remember how to play this.

557
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,890
Left-click or right-click to move them.

558
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,330
Oh yeah.

559
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,270
Oh my god.

560
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,130
I remember this.

561
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:02,450
Okay.

562
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,750
Spinal damage through a large.

563
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,730
50% damage.

564
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,050
Okay.

565
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,070
I think I used it.

566
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,010
I got this first.

567
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,590
I remember.

568
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,290
Left-click then right-click to move.

569
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,530
Oh my god.

570
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,230
This is like actual...

571
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,890
Jesus Christ.

572
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,470
Why is Gandalf so fucking loud?

573
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,790
Oh my god.

574
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,570
They're fighting.

575
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,910
Look at him go.

576
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,290
Wait.

577
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,830
Why is my sorrow man so fucking weak?

578
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:39,570
No.

579
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,930
Sorrow man.

580
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:46,550
What?

581
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,850
What?

582
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,390
What happened?

583
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,670
Bro.

584
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,790
I thought this was a 1v1.

585
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,270
Guys, I don't remember the campaign.

586
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,190
I told you guys.

587
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,750
I just remember controlling units.

588
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,730
It's been like...

589
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,610
It's been like a long time since I've played.

590
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:23,690
I...

591
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,030
How did...

592
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,970
I thought this was a 1v1.

593
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,890
Sorrow man.

594
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,290
How the fuck was I supposed to know you wanted help?

595
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,970
Oh my god.

596
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,290
I thought this was an honorable fight.

597
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,890
I legitimately thought we were 1v1ing.

598
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,730
There is no 1v1 here.

599
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:43,610
I don't...

600
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,910
The sun was in...

601
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,350
I had to change my...

602
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,770
I had to change my fucking...

603
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:50,790
Okay.

604
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,230
Okay.

605
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:52,970
Sound guy.

606
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,430
What do I have to fix for sound?

607
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,830
But you're the evil...

608
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,730
I might be evil, but I still have honor.

609
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,750
Like...

610
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,190
I got filtered by Gandalf the Great.

611
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,990
Evil...

612
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,590
I thought we were having an honor system with 1v1s.

613
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,030
I was...

614
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,210
Nah, joking.

615
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,590
You guys.

616
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,750
He literally rode up and beat...

617
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,070
Like, I thought this was like an old man fighting.

618
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,130
I was like, oh shit.

619
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,490
Cool.

620
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,650
A 1v1 with old men.

621
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,290
Like...

622
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,450
Okay, movie down.

623
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:26,770
Alright.

624
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,790
I don't know.

625
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,910
I don't know if it was like...

626
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,470
Evil never prospered.

627
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,250
Okay.

628
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,170
We'll just do this for now.

629
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,590
I was not expecting that.

630
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,670
He just rode up and fucking killed me.

631
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,050
He...

632
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,110
He literally...

633
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,590
Gandalf just rode up and fucking beat up my other...

634
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,410
My old man.

635
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,290
Holy fuck.

636
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,950
I was not expecting that.

637
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,710
I legitimately...

638
00:29:59,410 --> 00:29:59,830
Like...

639
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,690
I don't know.

640
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,430
Well, now that I know he's gonna fucking show up.

641
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,470
I'm fucking sending people here.

642
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,910
There we go.

643
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,970
Can't be that bad now, right?

644
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,870
Like...

645
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,130
Sorry, man.

646
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,170
Okay.

647
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,650
What is my...

648
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,810
Chop down the trees...

649
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,790
In Eisendrath to uncover...

650
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,030
Found...

651
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,990
Recruit 50...

652
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,250
Build...

653
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:24,590
Okay.

654
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,130
That I can do.

655
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:26,470
Okay.

656
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,490
I'm literally going in like right up, right away.

657
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,970
Like, they're chopping right now.

658
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,530
Like, what the fuck am I...

659
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,270
Okay, there he goes.

660
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,710
There he comes back.

661
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,370
He's back.

662
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,730
He's back, guys.

663
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,770
The old man is back.

664
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,970
Don't worry!

665
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,570
Round two.

666
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,670
Get over here!

667
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,590
Help him!

668
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,330
Help him!

669
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,670
Help him!

670
00:30:59,170 --> 00:30:59,630
Saruman!

671
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,110
I...

672
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,070
What?!

673
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,730
Kill him!

674
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,810
There's no way!

675
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,150
How the fuck...

676
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,510
There's no way!

677
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,490
How the fuck...

678
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,010
I don't understand!

679
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,530
I don't unders...

680
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,010
I don't understand!

681
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,430
What if he just fucking kills me?

682
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,050
Okay.

683
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,070
I can't control Saruman.

684
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,830
He won't let me control him.

685
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,340
I don't...

686
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,380
I don't...

687
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:30,930
No!

688
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,190
You don't understand!

689
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,460
I clicked Saruman...

690
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,050
And he's like...

691
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,150
He won't let me control him.

692
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,450
I don't...

693
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,410
I don't...

694
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,810
I clicked on him.

695
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,930
I don't know why he refused to let me control him.

696
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,930
Like, it's actually crazy.

697
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,410
He won't let...

698
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,130
I didn't...

699
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,070
I don't remember this.

700
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,070
Okay.

701
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,410
I can't move past here!

702
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,490
That is so fucked!

703
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,170
I actually can't...

704
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,070
Oh my god!

705
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,670
I actually can't move this specific area.

706
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:11,830
Wait!

707
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,730
There's no way!

708
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,930
There's no way!

709
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,070
I have to listen to this again!

710
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,570
I don't understand!

711
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,570
How is he...

712
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,890
Saruman, don't!

713
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,790
Don't!

714
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,790
Saruman!

715
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,170
Saruman, get out!

716
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,910
Oh my god, I can!

717
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,730
I can move him now!

718
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,970
I can move him now!

719
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:36,450
Get out!

720
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:37,410
Get out!

721
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,050
Go Saruman!

722
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,910
This isn't a 1v1 anymore!

723
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:42,850
Run!

724
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,550
Run!

725
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,690
Run!

726
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,710
I can move him!

727
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,050
Kill him!

728
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,650
Kill him!

729
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,750
Kill him!

730
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,750
I can't kill him!

731
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,410
He won't let me kill...

732
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,010
Oh my god, you fucker!

733
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,750
Oh my god, he just runs away like a bitch!

734
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,530
Oh my god!

735
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,690
Okay, Saruman is okay now.

736
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,610
Guys, everything is okay.

737
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,170
I figured it out, guys.

738
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,470
I figured it out.

739
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,770
Oh my god.

740
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,290
Alright, he can run now.

741
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,650
Guys, he can run.

742
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,130
I don't have abilities open yet, guys.

743
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,210
Oh my god.

744
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,950
Thank fucking god.

745
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,250
Everything is okay, guys.

746
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,450
Okay.

747
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,490
Everything is okay.

748
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,190
Alright, what were my objectives now?

749
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,930
What were...

750
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,250
What were my...

751
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,990
What were my objectives?

752
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,770
Holy fuck.

753
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,810
That was scary.

754
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,350
That was actually scary, guys.

755
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,550
Oh my god, good job, Saruman.

756
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,950
You just stay here.

757
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,290
Like, it's fine.

758
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,890
You just...

759
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,490
I don't trust you.

760
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,150
Okay, let's just walker it.

761
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:03,990
Wait, what?

762
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,070
What's over here?

763
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,890
Oh, I can build more trees, though.

764
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:08,670
Nice.

765
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:11,810
Nice.

766
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,310
Alright.

767
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,010
What were my objectives?

768
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,110
We need 50.

769
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,350
I can make 50.

770
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,270
That's fine.

771
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,470
And then I'll make another boat.

772
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,490
And then we'll have more wood.

773
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,230
Let's go!

774
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,550
Fuck the environment.

775
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,650
Oh, yes!

776
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,750
We get to kill trees!

777
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,510
Oh, shit!

778
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,170
Oh, fuck.

779
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,970
Okay, um...

780
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,250
Don't worry.

781
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,490
I'm heading over.

782
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,590
Oh, shit.

783
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,130
Maybe I should be over here.

784
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,290
Alright, don't worry, buddy!

785
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,230
Don't worry!

786
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,230
Alright.

787
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,870
Go!

788
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,970
Get over there!

789
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,890
Burn the trees!

790
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,290
This is it!

791
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,650
This is what you were bent to do!

792
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,010
There we go!

793
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:00,430
Go!

794
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,350
Kill the trees!

795
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,350
Burn the trees!

796
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,070
Burn all the trees!

797
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,950
Oh my god, Saruman!

798
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,010
Saruman, you gotta... Oh my god, beam him!

799
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,190
Saruman, please!

800
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,470
Beam him!

801
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,730
That's right!

802
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,630
What the fuck are you doing?

803
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,370
Okay, there we go.

804
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,170
See, look at that.

805
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,370
Fuck the trees.

806
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,870
Guys, see?

807
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,550
I can learn.

808
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,670
See, guys?

809
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,370
Oh, shit.

810
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:27,630
Wait.

811
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,110
Okay, get that.

812
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,190
Just keep cutting down the trees and everything will be fine.

813
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,470
Uh...

814
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,490
Everything will be fine, guys.

815
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,710
We don't need to spy on anybody.

816
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,650
Oh, fuck!

817
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,030
Okay!

818
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,470
Um...

819
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,050
Okay!

820
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:44,970
Uh...

821
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,470
Get over here!

822
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,710
Alright, there we go.

823
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,990
Don't worry.

824
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,730
Inspire.

825
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,550
Inspire them.

826
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,050
Whoa, so inspiring!

827
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,490
Alright, there you go.

828
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,670
See, look at that.

829
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,770
Ever since...

830
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,850
Ever since I figured it out, guys.

831
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,110
I figured it out, everyone.

832
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:04,670
I...

833
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,130
I just had to get through the first hurdle.

834
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,550
Which was Saruman.

835
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,530
I...

836
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,350
I just...

837
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,290
I just had to get through the first hurdle.

838
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,990
Which was Gandalf.

839
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,690
Gandalf was like...

840
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,790
Was the hardest part about this entire game.

841
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,590
For some reason.

842
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,590
That's all.

843
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,790
I don't know why.

844
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,970
Gandalf was so fucking hard.

845
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,630
Okay, nice.

846
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,730
Everything should be fine.

847
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,550
Get those L's out of here.

848
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,130
I mean, he is Gandalf.

849
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,870
We figured it out, everyone.

850
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,950
We figured it out.

851
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,970
Everyone is...

852
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,810
We're all okay now, guys.

853
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,510
We're all okay.

854
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,350
This Pokemon fight is nuts.

855
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,370
Oh my god.

856
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,790
That shit went fucking hard.

857
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,570
Wait, I cut up all the trees.

858
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,670
I'm running out of trees to cut, guys.

859
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,790
This is not good.

860
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,010
I'm actually...

861
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,470
Oh shit, not...

862
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:03,890
Okay.

863
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,090
Guard here.

864
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,030
Alright, that's good.

865
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,430
I am running...

866
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,850
I am running out of trees.

867
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,050
I am running out of trees to cut.

868
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,510
I wish I could farm these trees.

869
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,330
Don't worry, Saruman.

870
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,170
Let's just do that.

871
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,310
And then...

872
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,530
Inspire.

873
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,590
I can't inspire people yet.

874
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,630
There we go.

875
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,950
It's fine.

876
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,530
We have more people coming in.

877
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,510
It's fine.

878
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,030
More people are coming in.

879
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,290
Where are my other archers?

880
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,390
Wait, are they all dead?

881
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,310
How are they all dead already?

882
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,750
Okay, we'll keep farming.

883
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,690
Okay, that's fine.

884
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,450
That's fine.

885
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,730
We can...

886
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,370
We're okay.

887
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,270
This is like...

888
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,290
We're not very healthy right now, but it's okay.

889
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,070
Wait, what the fuck?

890
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,030
Wait, I lost some bread!

891
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,650
Bread man!

892
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,690
Okay, that's fine.

893
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,130
That's fine.

894
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:04,870
We can rebuild.

895
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,490
We can always rebuild, everyone.

896
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,850
We can always rebuild.

897
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,210
It's fine.

898
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,050
We're rebuilding.

899
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,490
And then we'll get fire.

900
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,070
We're rebuilding.

901
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,710
It's okay.

902
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:15,610
You know what?

903
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,630
Just inspire this particular...

904
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,690
Oh my god, they're trying to kill my little men.

905
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,010
Okay.

906
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,490
Get the fire arrows in.

907
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,030
We can always rebuild, guys.

908
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,930
Okay, yeah.

909
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,690
We're definitely running out of...

910
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,670
We're running out of stuff right now.

911
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,250
It's okay.

912
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,450
The tree is just going on a little stroll.

913
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,510
Okay, nice.

914
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,630
Everything is fine.

915
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,970
We just simply rebuild ourselves.

916
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,130
And then just...

917
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,550
Keep getting wood, I guess.

918
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,010
Yay!

919
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,170
Oh wait, not yay!

920
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,310
Wait, not yay!

921
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,870
No, wait!

922
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,150
Wait!

923
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,110
Oh shit!

924
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,150
Oh shit, get over here!

925
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,450
Get over here!

926
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,510
Oh shit!

927
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,490
Oh shit!

928
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,870
Wait, I wasn't ready!

929
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,650
Wait!

930
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,190
Oh, fuck!

931
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,210
Where are they coming from?

932
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,430
Okay.

933
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,530
Oh, that's a lot.

934
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,430
Um, that's fine.

935
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,550
We'll guard here.

936
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,230
That's fine.

937
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,030
We can...

938
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,770
We'll be okay, guys.

939
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:18,930
We'll...

940
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,470
We'll be...

941
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,150
Oh, wait, can I close the gate?

942
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,690
No, they won't let me!

943
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,670
They won't let me close the gate!

944
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,410
They're like, I can take them.

945
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,810
My people are like, I can take them.

946
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,770
But what if I can't?

947
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,490
What if...

948
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,490
What if I can't take them?

949
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,270
Okay, wait.

950
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,050
Am I running out... Do I not have trees anymore?

951
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,290
I don't have trees anymore.

952
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,610
Bro, they're not even fucking farming trees anymore!

953
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,390
Because I don't have trees!

954
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,330
Cut these trees.

955
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,090
Get out.

956
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,070
Get outside and cut these trees.

957
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,010
Um...

958
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,030
Oh, they do?

959
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,190
Get up top.

960
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,410
Get up top.

961
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,910
Get up top.

962
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,510
It's sad.

963
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,110
I have three of them.

964
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,570
Oh, this is bad.

965
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,730
This is...

966
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,450
Okay.

967
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,390
I might have too many crossbows.

968
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,150
I think I realized...

969
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,750
I might have...

970
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,350
I might have...

971
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,010
I might have recruited too many crossbows.

972
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:25,230
Just...

973
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,910
Oh, um...

974
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,350
Um...

975
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,690
This is a little... It's okay, I have him.

976
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,910
He'll be here.

977
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,810
He'll be here to be part of this.

978
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,510
He'll be here.

979
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,070
He's here too.

980
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,570
Um, I think it's okay.

981
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,770
I think we're fine.

982
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,630
We'll be fine.

983
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,670
We're so fine.

984
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,170
We're so fine.

985
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,310
Everything...

986
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,370
Alright, I can take them.

987
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,110
I can take them.

988
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,530
Don't worry.

989
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,810
I might have accidentally...

990
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,690
Made all crossbows.

991
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,310
But I can take them.

992
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,550
There you go.

993
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,450
It'll be fine.

994
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,690
It'll be so fine.

995
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,390
These guys...

996
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,970
You just stay there.

997
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:10,810
You'll stay there.

998
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,730
It's okay.

999
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,610
It's okay.

1000
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,350
Build 16.

1001
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,450
What am I gonna do with 16?

1002
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,890
Finish the level.

1003
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,290
Oh my god.

1004
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,570
What can I build?

1005
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,890
I don't even have trees anymore to build this.

1006
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,230
They're cutting trees outside my building.

1007
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,590
Alright.

1008
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,770
Oh my god.

1009
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,250
You know what?

1010
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,070
Let's just...

1011
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,350
Let's just casually build more of these just in case, you know.

1012
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,530
Let's just... We have the money.

1013
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,150
We might as well, you know.

1014
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,970
Just one, two...

1015
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,350
Oh gosh.

1016
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:51,970
Okay.

1017
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,530
Okay.

1018
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,410
They'll come over.

1019
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,250
Get the pikemen.

1020
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,590
Do I have pikemen?

1021
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,010
Guys, I don't think I have any.

1022
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,350
I only have these guys.

1023
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,630
These are my only pikemen.

1024
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,970
All the others died.

1025
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:23,990
Did you know Christopher Lee actually won an Oscar for his performance in a scene where Saruman runs in circles away from Gandalf?

1026
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,950
Thank you for the superchat, BladeWing.

1027
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,350
Thank you.

1028
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,150
Come on!

1029
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,350
Come on!

1030
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,070
Fight me!

1031
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,330
Come on!

1032
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,530
I ain't scared.

1033
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,570
I'm a little scared.

1034
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,330
Fight me!

1035
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,130
Ride in!

1036
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,110
Do it!

1037
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,390
Don't be a pussy!

1038
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,690
Oh wait, I have an extra bow arrow guy.

1039
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,230
Ride in!

1040
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,210
Goodbye!

1041
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,950
I have to bait them in?

1042
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:50,690
Okay.

1043
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,710
I can always recruit this guy.

1044
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,210
It's fine.

1045
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:54,730
Alright.

1046
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:56,530
That's fine.

1047
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,590
I can use him.

1048
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,470
You can die.

1049
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,130
It's fine.

1050
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,470
That's right!

1051
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:02,410
Oh!

1052
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,450
Oh, he didn't see me.

1053
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,750
He didn't see me.

1054
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:07,130
Okay.

1055
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,410
Your mom's a whore!

1056
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,250
That's right!

1057
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,270
Oh my god!

1058
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:15,210
Oh my god!

1059
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,170
Oh my god!

1060
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,030
Please shoot them!

1061
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,330
Please shoot them!

1062
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,590
Please shoot them!

1063
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:21,990
Please!

1064
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,230
Shoot them!

1065
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,090
Oh my god!

1066
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:27,690
Keep shooting!

1067
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,210
Keep shooting!

1068
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,230
Oh!

1069
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,430
All mistakes are definitely made.

1070
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,370
Oh my god!

1071
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,070
Guys, I'm a little...

1072
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,410
Guys, I...

1073
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,490
This is not looking so good right now.

1074
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,730
Oh my god!

1075
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,810
They're coming over!

1076
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,490
They're coming over!

1077
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:56,350
Oh my god!

1078
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,110
Where are you?

1079
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,410
Get out of here!

1080
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:00,990
Get out!

1081
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,170
Get out!

1082
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,570
Holy shit!

1083
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,250
Get out!

1084
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,490
Just let them die!

1085
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,230
Just let them...

1086
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,370
Don't be a hero!

1087
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,570
Don't be a hero!

1088
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,290
Don't be a hero!

1089
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,090
It's okay.

1090
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,430
Everything is fine.

1091
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:20,690
See?

1092
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,650
We're all okay.

1093
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:23,650
Look at that!

1094
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:24,990
Look at that!

1095
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:25,950
Everything is fine.

1096
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:26,530
I told you.

1097
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,250
We lost him.

1098
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,210
We lost him again, but we'll bring him back.

1099
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,110
You...

1100
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,590
No, Saruman needs to relax after what we did.

1101
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,230
Look, see?

1102
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,690
Nothing to be worried about.

1103
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,930
We did it!

1104
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,390
Masterfully played.

1105
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,010
Yay!

1106
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,680
We did it!

1107
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,260
Yay!

1108
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,680
Look, guys.

1109
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,080
Saruman has been through a lot.

1110
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,540
He's like...

1111
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,160
He got fucked up by Gandalf like three times, guys.

1112
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,960
He needed to rest.

1113
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,240
He needed to rest, guys.

1114
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,100
Oh my god, we did it!

1115
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,860
Alright, nice.

1116
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,560
That was easy.

1117
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,900
See, guys?

1118
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,800
Look at that.

1119
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,720
That was so easy, guys.

1120
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,540
Oh, okay.

1121
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,660
Wait, can I spend it now?

1122
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,960
I wonder if I have to save...

1123
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,480
Okay, new save files.

1124
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,500
That's my save file.

1125
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,800
Yay!

1126
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,620
Okay, let me see the sound guy.

1127
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,580
Overall, I'm bringing down the mood.

1128
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,140
Movie slider?

1129
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:08,540
Okay.

1130
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Don't worry, I got you.

1131
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,480
Okay, options.

1132
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,540
Overall.

1133
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,560
And then bring down the movie.

1134
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,300
Okay, I'll put this.

1135
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,560
This.

1136
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:22,860
This.

1137
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,560
Alright, let me know if that's better.

1138
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,220
Alright.

1139
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,080
Now that the hard part is over.

1140
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,540
This should be smooth sailing now, right?

1141
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,020
Oh my god, we get to burn more trees?

1142
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,280
It's Christmas!

1143
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,360
It's my birthday!

1144
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,780
Every villain is lemons.

1145
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,200
Oh my god, finally!

1146
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,920
What I actually wanted to do this entire time.

1147
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,500
Okay.

1148
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,610
Yeah,

1149
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,630
fuck the trees!

1150
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:21,810
Finally!

1151
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,050
We're playing my video game!

1152
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,290
Finally!

1153
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,490
We're playing my video game now!

1154
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,450
Oh shit!

1155
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,310
Oh fuck, okay.

1156
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,030
That's not cool.

1157
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,530
Oh shit, okay.

1158
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,250
Give me a sec.

1159
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:48,690
Okay.

1160
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:49,670
That's fine.

1161
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,270
That's fine.

1162
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,450
It's okay.

1163
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,030
It's okay, we don't need him.

1164
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,150
We never needed him.

1165
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,710
Okay, three...

1166
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,050
I want to get the...

1167
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:10,810
Okay, I want the tree one.

1168
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,590
I want this one.

1169
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:14,350
Alright, nice.

1170
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,690
Okay, so we gotta get there.

1171
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,210
Alright, Saruman!

1172
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,050
I believe in you!

1173
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,670
I believe in you, old man!

1174
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:29,030
I believe in you, old man!

1175
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,130
Oh shit!

1176
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:33,830
You know what?

1177
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:34,750
It's just one guy.

1178
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:37,970
That's fucking right.

1179
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,890
You know what?

1180
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:40,590
Fuck you.

1181
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,510
That's right, stupid elves.

1182
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,730
That's right, you think I won't?

1183
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:47,810
Boom!

1184
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,090
There you go.

1185
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,890
You're 1v1 me?

1186
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,890
Oh my god, you're still alive?

1187
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,510
Get out of here!

1188
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:55,890
Boom!

1189
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:56,530
Alright.

1190
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,330
You think I won't?

1191
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,490
You're just... you're nothing!

1192
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:04,930
Okay, there's a lot.

1193
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,250
Nevermind, let me...

1194
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,550
Okay, give me a sec.

1195
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,690
Let me bring the entire army now.

1196
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,110
Let me...

1197
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,790
Okay, that was a mistake.

1198
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,730
There was more than two guys.

1199
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:20,730
What the fuck?

1200
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,150
Get over here.

1201
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,850
Alright, get over here.

1202
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,850
Saruman is just bait.

1203
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:30,270
There we go.

1204
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,650
Guys, literally, what the fuck?

1205
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,710
Why does it take you 20 years to kill them?

1206
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,250
Alright, let's go.

1207
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:38,410
Let's go.

1208
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,730
Now we go!

1209
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,230
It's okay, everything is fine now.

1210
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:45,670
Look at that, we got our cap.

1211
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:48,750
Nice.

1212
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,970
Alright, we're fine now, guys.

1213
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:52,790
Guys, it's okay.

1214
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,910
Okay, I can reveal the location.

1215
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,690
You know what?

1216
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,770
Fuck it.

1217
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:00,430
Fuck it.

1218
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,050
Oh, okay.

1219
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,570
Oh, that's a lot.

1220
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,490
Wait, they're just all one people.

1221
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:08,410
It's just all one guy.

1222
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,850
I'm not gonna get one guy.

1223
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:11,710
Fuck it.

1224
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,130
Let's go.

1225
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,510
Let's go, Saruman!

1226
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,130
Let's go!

1227
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,450
Beat this guy up!

1228
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:22,110
Fuck him!

1229
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,890
Use the devastation power to clear trees?

1230
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:29,870
No, fuck it.

1231
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,070
I still have time for this.

1232
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,190
Wait, did I not...

1233
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,710
Oh shit, did I not claim this?

1234
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,450
Sorry, I...

1235
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,190
Did you lose all your marble keys?

1236
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,470
This is a forced stream.

1237
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,910
No, I actually...

1238
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,190
I actually won my games.

1239
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,590
I actually won my games.

1240
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,110
I just feel...

1241
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,830
You know, you don't get a lot...

1242
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,030
Oh, slaughterhouse, wait.

1243
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,190
Alright, let's get slaughterhouse.

1244
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:00,130
You know, you don't get a lot of time to, like, you know, be evil for once, you know?

1245
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,150
For once in your lives.

1246
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,510
Don't you get tired of being good?

1247
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,170
Don't you wanna go ape-batshit crazy sometimes?

1248
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:06,510
Sometimes...

1249
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,010
Sometimes I'm tired of being good.

1250
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,170
Sometimes I just wanna fucking kill people.

1251
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,610
Like, but like, you know, like...

1252
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,950
Not like that, but...

1253
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,150
In-game.

1254
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,710
In-game, guys.

1255
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,370
In-game.

1256
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:26,330
Don't you sometimes just wanna, you know...

1257
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:27,790
Kill...

1258
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,050
Kill elves?

1259
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,310
Is that too much to ask for?

1260
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,310
Don't you just, you know...

1261
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,770
Don't you guys ever thought about killing some elves?

1262
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:44,930
If they were real?

1263
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,070
Cause they're not real, guys.

1264
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,390
Just remember, they're not real.

1265
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:49,310
Okay.

1266
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:50,510
What's over here?

1267
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,810
Oh, fuck that one guy in particular, though.

1268
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,050
Like, what is he gonna do?

1269
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,610
What's over here?

1270
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,750
Is there anything in here?

1271
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:03,730
Oh, shit.

1272
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,050
Friends?

1273
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,350
Oh my god, friends!

1274
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,370
Let's go!

1275
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,010
Nice.

1276
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,130
We have friends now.

1277
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:14,870
Okay.

1278
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,250
Yeah, fuck this one guy, too, in particular.

1279
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,650
That's fucking right.

1280
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,010
Wait, where's my other big boys?

1281
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:23,610
Alright, let's see.

1282
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,350
Block formation.

1283
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,530
Alright, that's fine.

1284
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,030
You know what?

1285
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,530
Let's grab food.

1286
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:36,610
Reduce costs of wargriders.

1287
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,750
Upgrades.

1288
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:39,050
Reduce...

1289
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,210
Let's just get this.

1290
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,190
And then...

1291
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:44,510
That's fine.

1292
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:47,950
Alright, let's go!

1293
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:48,690
Fuck yeah!

1294
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,950
Let's go, Isengard!

1295
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,540
I gotta like...

1296
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,420
Alright, let's just get these guys.

1297
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,260
Over here.

1298
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,820
And then these guys.

1299
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,580
You know what?

1300
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,920
Just go fucking...

1301
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,260
Let's just...

1302
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,260
Alright, use that fireball!

1303
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,060
You know what?

1304
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,900
Fuck it.

1305
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,780
Let's just kill anything you wanna kill.

1306
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,860
That's right.

1307
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,600
Just go crazy.

1308
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,680
Do whatever the fuck you want.

1309
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,940
Saruman can take these guys.

1310
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,520
Oh, shit, let's go!

1311
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,760
Go, Saruman, go!

1312
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,100
Oh, I lost one guy.

1313
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:29,660
Alright.

1314
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,900
That's right, beat him up!

1315
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,640
Wait, can I grab?

1316
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,780
Grab a tree!

1317
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:35,880
Grab a tree!

1318
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,100
Do it!

1319
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,160
Use a tree!

1320
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,080
Grab another tree!

1321
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,860
Oh my god, yes!

1322
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,240
Okay, let's just claim this.

1323
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,960
Oh wait, I can claim this automatically.

1324
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:50,620
Fuck it.

1325
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,040
Mine now, yoink!

1326
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,620
Yoink, it's mine now.

1327
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,860
Where's my ogre?

1328
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,540
Wait, I only have two ogres?

1329
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,860
Oh my god, get these guys.

1330
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,480
Wait, where's his friend?

1331
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,240
Where the fuck is his friend?

1332
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,800
Yeah, use a tree against him!

1333
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,660
That's right.

1334
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,820
That's fucking right.

1335
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,940
Okay, let's build this real fast.

1336
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,860
And then we'll claim here.

1337
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,740
Wait, who's attacking?

1338
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:22,760
What the fuck?

1339
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,660
What are you doing here?

1340
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,740
Get out!

1341
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,900
Oh my god, no!

1342
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,340
How did you get here?

1343
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,440
How the fuck did you get all the way here?

1344
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh, I don't think he's gonna live, guys.

1345
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,520
No!

1346
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,380
I don't even know how he got there!

1347
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,460
How the fuck did he get there?

1348
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,720
How did he get there?

1349
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,740
Oh my god, I don't even know how he got there, guys.

1350
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,460
I don't know what happened.

1351
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,560
He just decided to live there for some fucking reason.

1352
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,980
Oh my god.

1353
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,700
My poor ogres.

1354
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,460
I don't know what the fuck he was doing.

1355
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,600
Alright, let's see.

1356
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,540
Wait, what?

1357
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,580
Where is he?

1358
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,160
Where is he?

1359
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,620
Oh my god, I forgot he even existed.

1360
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,560
I forgot he was in my game.

1361
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,000
What the fuck?

1362
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,840
What are you doing here?

1363
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,220
Alright, we still have our two ogres though.

1364
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,120
Our two ogres with trees.

1365
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,920
I don't know the shortcuts for this game.

1366
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,960
So I'm just like caveman styling this right now.

1367
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,240
Guys, I'm so sorry.

1368
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
I'm sorry.

1369
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,020
I'm playing, I'm doing caveman style.

1370
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,680
I don't know the shortcuts for this game.

1371
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,320
Guys, this game came out in 2004.

1372
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,620
Is it 2004?

1373
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,740
Oh my god, does this game actually come out in 2004?

1374
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,300
I don't remember.

1375
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,940
Yeah, fuck that one guy.

1376
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,460
Guys, it's been a while.

1377
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,100
Yeah.

1378
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,800
Oh my god, his entire family is dead.

1379
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,220
His entire family is actually dead.

1380
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,460
Let's grab this.

1381
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,840
Get over here.

1382
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,300
Who is shooting me?

1383
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,300
Who is this one person that is shooting me?

1384
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,060
Alright.

1385
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,320
Nice.

1386
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:30,900
Fucking...

1387
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,040
I don't like how...

1388
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,440
Okay.

1389
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,200
I need to do this and then...

1390
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,300
And then do...

1391
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:37,920
Wait, where is it?

1392
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:39,820
Okay.

1393
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:41,980
There we go.

1394
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,740
Saruman, I need you to use this real fast.

1395
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,960
There we go.

1396
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,880
Get him out of here.

1397
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,600
And then use this real fast too.

1398
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,420
And then also do that.

1399
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,820
And then...

1400
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,300
And then let's just grab people in here.

1401
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,260
Okay, it doesn't matter.

1402
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,240
We don't have enough units.

1403
00:56:59,280 --> 00:56:59,900
That's alright.

1404
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,860
Saruman, protect us!

1405
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,500
Alright, it's time.

1406
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,520
It's time to kill the trees.

1407
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,020
It's your big moment, everybody.

1408
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:13,760
Alright.

1409
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,400
Saruman, you stay here.

1410
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,660
And you watch in the side.

1411
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,600
Oh, it's Q select all units?

1412
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,320
Okay, nice.

1413
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:21,840
Alright.

1414
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,740
And then...

1415
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,680
Fuck the trees.

1416
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,220
It's time.

1417
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,740
It's time to burn the forest.

1418
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,580
Ever since...

1419
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,820
Guys, you know what's even worse?

1420
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,640
Groot is now sort of meta now.

1421
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,400
In the high elos.

1422
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,720
So this is like very therapeutic for me.

1423
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,660
This is...

1424
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,660
For some reason, Groot has become meta.

1425
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,940
So like...

1426
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,600
This is absolutely incredibly therapeutic right now.

1427
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,220
Oh my god.

1428
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,140
That's right.

1429
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,780
Wait, they're all dead.

1430
00:57:59,240 --> 00:57:59,980
Wait a minute.

1431
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,600
Wait, how are they all dead?

1432
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,360
What?

1433
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,580
Oh, fuck.

1434
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,660
Oh, wait.

1435
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,540
Wait.

1436
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,000
Wait, they're all dead.

1437
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:12,960
Wait a minute.

1438
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,560
Wait, they're all dead.

1439
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,580
Oh, fuck.

1440
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,620
Oh, fuck.

1441
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,540
Wait, they're all dead.

1442
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,540
Wait, how are they all dead?

1443
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,220
Oh, help.

1444
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,020
Help, sir.

1445
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,860
I'm fucked up.

1446
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:32,980
Oh.

1447
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,580
Oh, fuck.

1448
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,580
I'm fucked up.

1449
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,020
Oh my god.

1450
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:39,760
Keep running.

1451
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:40,880
Keep running.

1452
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,340
Oh, shit.

1453
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,940
Quickly, sir.

1454
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,560
Come on.

1455
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,440
Quickly.

1456
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,820
Oh, no, no.

1457
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:51,860
No, no.

1458
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:52,680
No.

1459
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,540
I didn't press the subscribe.

1460
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,860
Wait, can I rebuild Sorobot?

1461
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,820
Oh my god, I can bring him back.

1462
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,880
I can bring him back.

1463
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,080
Guys, it's okay.

1464
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,060
Guys, guys.

1465
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,320
I can bring him back, guys.

1466
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,200
I can bring Sorobot back.

1467
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,100
Guys, I didn't know.

1468
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,100
Oh my god.

1469
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,720
What the fuck?

1470
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,780
What the fuck?

1471
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,140
What fucking BS3?

1472
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,300
I didn't know.

1473
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,960
Holy shit.

1474
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,240
He's just stoned black.

1475
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,240
I'm jumping down.

1476
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,220
I am rude.

1477
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,440
Your entire army died.

1478
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,920
Don't you die.

1479
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,960
Oh my god.

1480
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,720
Bro, why is he so strong?

1481
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,200
Holy shit.

1482
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,660
He fucking died.

1483
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,620
Oh my god.

1484
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,840
He just killed them.

1485
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,760
He killed them all.

1486
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,820
What the fuck?

1487
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,360
Oh my god.

1488
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,620
Trees smacked the taste out of you.

1489
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,620
He killed them all.

1490
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,280
Just one guy.

1491
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,760
It's fine, it's fine.

1492
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,260
I'm creating armory right now.

1493
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,420
Oh my god.

1494
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,480
It's okay.

1495
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,060
Oh my god.

1496
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,320
The fuck do I do?

1497
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,080
Is there anything?

1498
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,080
Why is he so strong?

1499
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,120
Holy shit.

1500
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,280
Let me grab upgrades.

1501
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,120
I just realized I didn't upgrade at all.

1502
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,560
That makes a lot more sense.

1503
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,000
Oh my god.

1504
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,800
Okay, that was...

1505
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,820
That was...

1506
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,560
That was very scary, guys.

1507
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,660
That was very scary.

1508
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,360
Like, don't worry, he's coming back.

1509
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:07,860
Saruman.

1510
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,860
Welcome back, Saruman.

1511
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,720
It's like nothing bad happened, guys.

1512
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,440
It's like...

1513
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,580
Guys, it's okay.

1514
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,880
Nothing bad has happened.

1515
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,720
We got it.

1516
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,440
We just gotta wait for all our upgrades and then we should be fine.

1517
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,020
Guys, we just need this.

1518
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,800
We rebuilt him.

1519
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,440
Guys, we can always rebuild.

1520
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,460
Remember that.

1521
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,580
We can rebuild and make them stronger.

1522
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:40,920
Okay.

1523
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,740
Alright, we can have this upgrade.

1524
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,640
Okay, this time.

1525
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,260
We can do this, guys.

1526
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,380
Guys, this time.

1527
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,840
Nothing can stop us now.

1528
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,140
We should be fine.

1529
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,880
Jesus Christ.

1530
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,480
Why are they so strong?

1531
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,640
Okay, alright.

1532
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,480
I need to learn control groups for this one.

1533
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,600
But, like, I can't be bothered right now.

1534
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,660
Okay, we'll put these guys here.

1535
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,820
Oh, my God.

1536
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,600
Let's not put them over there.

1537
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:18,980
No, no, no, no.

1538
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,500
Get back.

1539
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:20,540
Get back.

1540
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,680
Get back.

1541
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,220
No.

1542
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,560
Oh, fuck.

1543
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,660
Okay, we're going in.

1544
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,780
We're committing.

1545
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,620
We're committing.

1546
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,300
We're committing.

1547
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:32,720
Okay.

1548
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,320
Okay, okay, that's fine.

1549
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:38,220
Okay.

1550
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,400
I believe.

1551
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,230
I believe.

1552
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,290
And then, Soroban.

1553
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:51,530
Right here.

1554
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:54,510
Soroban, this is it.

1555
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,230
Use the fire.

1556
01:02:58,030 --> 01:02:59,350
There we go.

1557
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,190
There we go.

1558
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:04,990
That's right.

1559
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,910
Chop him.

1560
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:08,110
We're figuring it out, Soroban.

1561
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,610
We're figuring it out.

1562
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:12,450
It's okay.

1563
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:13,870
They're too busy.

1564
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,350
They're so busy.

1565
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:18,950
He's dead, but, like, that's okay.

1566
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:21,270
That's okay.

1567
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:24,450
That's okay.

1568
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,070
It's just okay.

1569
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:25,590
It's me.

1570
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:26,670
Oh, Soroban.

1571
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:31,190
Soroban, get out of here.

1572
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,530
Get out of here, Soroban.

1573
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,530
That's okay.

1574
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:38,290
Round two.

1575
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,730
That's okay.

1576
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,890
We have backup, guys.

1577
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:45,370
It's okay.

1578
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,490
Backup is coming.

1579
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,910
Soroban, you just stay there and look pretty.

1580
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:54,170
You just stay there and look pretty, Soroban.

1581
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:55,210
It's fine.

1582
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:57,610
It's fine.

1583
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,010
That's right.

1584
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,350
Everything is okay.

1585
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,090
We just...

1586
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,130
We did it.

1587
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:03,870
Yay.

1588
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:07,510
We did it.

1589
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,630
I can see why Groot is meta now.

1590
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:14,330
We did it, guys.

1591
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:18,090
Guys, I think they used their Namor-Groot combo on us.

1592
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:21,670
Fuck the trees!

1593
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,330
Who needs oxygen?

1594
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:29,350
The less oxygen we have, the more I can bottle and sell for profit.

1595
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:33,550
That's right.

1596
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,590
Wait, what?

1597
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:36,970
Why are there hobbits?

1598
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:37,970
Who the fuck?

1599
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:39,370
Who the fuck?

1600
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,590
Why are you here?

1601
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,010
Bro!

1602
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,910
Alright, get out of here.

1603
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:46,990
How are you level 10?

1604
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:47,830
Get out!

1605
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:50,310
Go back to your own movie!

1606
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:51,710
Go back!

1607
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,590
Get out of here!

1608
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:59,330
Go back to the fucking Hobbitlands!

1609
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,570
Go back to New Zealand!

1610
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:01,950
Get out!

1611
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:08,330
Go back to New Zealand, you fuckers!

1612
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:09,050
Get out!

1613
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,330
This is my story!

1614
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:13,910
The Shire!

1615
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,210
Alright, back to where I...

1616
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,290
Toki can't say that.

1617
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:24,270
Alright, there you go.

1618
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,390
Back to...

1619
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,210
Back to what I'm actually here for.

1620
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,010
Okay, we gotta get the fire out.

1621
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:34,270
This is an RT stream because there's no strategy.

1622
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,870
What do you mean?

1623
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,850
There's so much strategy!

1624
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,050
I killed the trees!

1625
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,810
Is that not enough strategy?

1626
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:46,030
I'm here to fuck the trees up!

1627
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:49,190
That is plenty enough strategy, guys.

1628
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,170
My strategy is to burn trees down.

1629
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,490
Real-time game.

1630
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,430
Not so Deadpool, thank you for the super chat.

1631
01:05:58,690 --> 01:05:59,410
Thank you, thank you.

1632
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:04,150
Full choice of the elves to bring peace-loving farmers into war.

1633
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,170
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

1634
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:08,270
Thank you, thank you.

1635
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:09,070
Yay!

1636
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,550
We did it, guys!

1637
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,910
We did it with no- We did it, guys.

1638
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:17,450
I was not panicking at all.

1639
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,370
Yay!

1640
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,270
Calm, cool, and collected.

1641
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,110
I can't believe the hobbits are level 10!

1642
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:35,290
I literally have the fucking- the fucking evil wizard and he's level 3.

1643
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,450
I didn't get to sing the Lorax Wunsler song again.

1644
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,230
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

1645
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,330
Thank you, thank you.

1646
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,990
Yay, I did it!

1647
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:51,810
Like, how are they level fucking 10?

1648
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:54,370
Who gave these hobbits XP?

1649
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:00,130
Yay!

1650
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,850
I hope Sauron is proud of me.

1651
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:05,430
My hero.

1652
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,410
I hope my hero saw what I did.

1653
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:12,090
Yeah, fuck Groot.

1654
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,130
Finally, so therapeutic.

1655
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:17,890
I've like been banning Groot in almost all my ranked games now.

1656
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,030
I fucking hate that character so much.

1657
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,560
Alright, nice.

1658
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:26,080
Yay!

1659
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,960
We're doing it!

1660
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,960
My oshi, Sauron!

1661
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,960
Okay, do I kill all of the elves?

1662
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,580
Wait, are these the elves?

1663
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,240
Wait, who do I want to invade?

1664
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,020
The Gap of Rohan?

1665
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:57,080
If I destroy the forest even more, that means destroying forests.

1666
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,540
Forests are made out of trees.

1667
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,140
Trees can die.

1668
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,720
And I hate trees.

1669
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:03,820
Let's go there.

1670
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:05,740
Yes.

1671
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,720
No, I hate him.

1672
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,700
I hate him.

1673
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,700
Logical.

1674
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,320
Yay!

1675
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,020
Let's burn the Amazon!

1676
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:17,360
Yay!

1677
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,400
No tree left standing.

1678
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,520
Ogres don't need a fucking breeze.

1679
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,840
Alright, let's get this.

1680
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,520
And then...

1681
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,520
Furnace.

1682
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,860
And then...

1683
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,400
This.

1684
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,720
And then...

1685
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,320
Where do I go?

1686
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,200
I mean, I can always rebuild Sauron.

1687
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,400
Fight off elves and ENTs.

1688
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,100
Oh my god, thank god.

1689
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,560
I get to kill two things I hate at once.

1690
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,740
What's that?

1691
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,960
Hello, goblins.

1692
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,900
Get out of here.

1693
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,980
Get out of here, lower fucking beings!

1694
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,520
That's fucking right.

1695
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,560
Get out of here.

1696
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,540
You really think you can beat me?

1697
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,820
Get out of here, you lower beings.

1698
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,140
Alright, wait.

1699
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,060
There's the enemy?

1700
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,520
Oh my god, what the fuck are they here already?

1701
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,440
Wait, what?

1702
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,000
Wait, already here?

1703
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,240
Oh shit.

1704
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,280
Oh shit.

1705
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,060
I was not ready for them to be here.

1706
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,720
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1707
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,500
How are they already here?

1708
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,060
What the fuck are these trees here?

1709
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,860
Oh god, okay.

1710
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:45,660
Okay.

1711
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:47,980
Okay, I did not expect them to be here already.

1712
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,940
I gotta build these, I guess.

1713
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:51,320
Oh, that's bad.

1714
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:51,620
Alright.

1715
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,680
Okay, I did not expect them to be here.

1716
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,620
Guys.

1717
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,060
Oh, I get the big berserkers.

1718
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,160
Where are the berserkers?

1719
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,440
Okay.

1720
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,380
Alright, nice.

1721
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,920
Oh, where's Sormon?

1722
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,220
Okay, we gotta let's do what I originally wanted to do.

1723
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,100
Let's build this too.

1724
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:15,340
Alright, I need to get this real fast.

1725
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,180
And then get over here.

1726
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,080
Deep berserk, okay.

1727
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,140
That's great to know.

1728
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,360
That's great to know.

1729
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,000
Thank god.

1730
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:28,020
Thank god I knew exactly what that does.

1731
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,500
Let's see.

1732
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,440
Okay, so it's just goblins.

1733
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,220
Alright, nice.

1734
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,160
If it's just goblins, I can just do this.

1735
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:37,540
And then...

1736
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,500
we can claim...

1737
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,000
I'll claim here.

1738
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,820
And then...

1739
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,260
Alright, nice.

1740
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,140
Alright, fuck.

1741
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:46,900
Guys, see?

1742
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,780
I told you!

1743
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,540
What do I have?

1744
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,380
I don't have enough money.

1745
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,780
Um... fuck!

1746
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,080
Okay.

1747
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,040
Okay.

1748
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,640
Okay, I need...

1749
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,580
Oh, fuck.

1750
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,340
Okay, I need... I'll buy more meat.

1751
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,540
And then... because I need to build this.

1752
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,120
Okay, and... Oh, shit!

1753
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:04,680
Nice money!

1754
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:06,940
That's what we needed.

1755
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,120
Okay, steal this.

1756
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:09,480
Yoink.

1757
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,520
My now.

1758
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,180
Provides food as a research.

1759
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,060
Provides lumber.

1760
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,100
Let's just get food.

1761
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,240
Alright, and then we get another building right here.

1762
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:18,680
See, guys?

1763
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,800
Look at the strategy I'm doing right now.

1764
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,800
And then...

1765
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,280
Let me claim this.

1766
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:26,720
Mine.

1767
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,160
Yoink.

1768
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,020
My now.

1769
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,320
There you go.

1770
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:31,580
See?

1771
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,060
Look at all the strategy!

1772
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,420
You guys said I can strategize.

1773
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,400
What's this?

1774
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:40,920
Vision?

1775
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,140
Oh, I can get it for 15 sec... Is this strategy?

1776
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:44,760
Yeah, yeah.

1777
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,380
That's strategy.

1778
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:49,040
I send units out and they die.

1779
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,900
Is this not strategic enough?

1780
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,280
Like...

1781
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,780
Is this not strategic enough?

1782
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,060
I send people out and they die.

1783
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,140
Oh, fuck.

1784
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:00,560
Oh, oh, fuck.

1785
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,700
Wait, they have horses?

1786
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,060
Wait, that's not fair!

1787
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,880
Why does mom let you have horses?

1788
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:09,660
Oh, shit.

1789
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,520
I have no one protecting the base.

1790
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,880
Oh, fuck.

1791
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:13,640
Oh, fuck.

1792
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,060
Okay.

1793
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:15,600
Don't worry.

1794
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,180
Don't worry.

1795
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,580
Oh, fuck.

1796
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:23,980
Oh, fuck.

1797
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:24,540
Okay.

1798
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:25,760
Don't worry.

1799
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:26,420
Don't worry.

1800
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,760
Everything is fine.

1801
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,200
Everything is fine, guys.

1802
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,460
Everything is fine.

1803
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,060
We need this.

1804
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,700
And then...

1805
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,120
Okay, this is a little awkward.

1806
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,740
Okay, I need to claim this real fast.

1807
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,080
Alright.

1808
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:47,200
And then, let me build...

1809
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:47,960
Oh, my head.

1810
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:48,960
My...

1811
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,940
There's so much...

1812
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,200
I'm trying to...

1813
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:53,960
What are these?

1814
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:54,820
Are they just people?

1815
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,840
What are the people gonna do?

1816
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,720
They're just people.

1817
01:12:58,920 --> 01:12:59,200
Okay.

1818
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,620
Everything is fine, guys.

1819
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:00,940
See?

1820
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,580
Everything is going okay.

1821
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,520
And then I'll just claim this.

1822
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:07,440
And then I'll just keep going.

1823
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,880
Oh, and then I can cut trees.

1824
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:10,580
Look at that.

1825
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,960
Tree down.

1826
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:13,820
There we go.

1827
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,700
Oh, fuck.

1828
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,260
Tree.

1829
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,060
Okay.

1830
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,760
Oh, that's awkward.

1831
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,560
Don't worry.

1832
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,840
I do not have enough command points.

1833
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,040
Oh, they sent horses.

1834
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,540
Oh, fuck.

1835
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:41,340
Wait.

1836
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,520
Wait a minute.

1837
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,500
Wait, this isn't fair.

1838
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,120
Wait.

1839
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,720
This is not fair.

1840
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,240
Why did they get all of that?

1841
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,220
Oh, shit.

1842
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:53,940
Okay, don't worry.

1843
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:54,560
I can rebuild.

1844
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,000
I can rebuild, guys.

1845
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,320
Guys, I can rebuild.

1846
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,400
Everything will be fine.

1847
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,400
Oh, shit.

1848
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,400
Oh, fuck.

1849
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,820
At least use your last dying breath to do fire.

1850
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,560
Dying breath to do fire.

1851
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,880
Oh, fuck.

1852
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,220
Okay.

1853
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,420
This is fun.

1854
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,060
This is so fun.

1855
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,360
This is fun.

1856
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,500
Oh, my God.

1857
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,260
Oh, no.

1858
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,660
Guys, this is fun.

1859
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,060
This is fun.

1860
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,160
Oh, this is so fun.

1861
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,600
Just keep building arrows.

1862
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,220
Just...

1863
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,740
This is fun.

1864
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,000
This is fun.

1865
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,740
This is...

1866
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,640
I'm sending people back.

1867
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,320
Just keep building.

1868
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,520
I'm okay.

1869
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,840
Guys, I don't think this is fun no more.

1870
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,800
Guys, this is not...

1871
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,240
Oh, guys.

1872
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,140
This is not fun.

1873
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,040
This is not fun.

1874
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,560
Guys, this is not fun no more.

1875
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,400
This is not fun.

1876
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:40,940
Oh, fuck.

1877
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,840
This is not fun anymore, everyone.

1878
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,840
Oh, my God.

1879
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,560
I didn't think they would...

1880
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,600
Oh, fuck.

1881
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:50,960
Okay.

1882
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,960
Don't worry.

1883
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,140
Sorava's coming back and he'll clutch it.

1884
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,300
I believe.

1885
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,500
I believe in the Sorava clutch.

1886
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,900
I have a Berserker coming in.

1887
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,740
He's gonna go fucking crazy.

1888
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:05,560
Watch this.

1889
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,840
He's gonna go fucking...

1890
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,880
Guys, my Berserker is dead.

1891
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,120
Guys, my Berserker died so fast.

1892
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,920
Oh, fuck.

1893
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,800
Okay, guys.

1894
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:25,550
It's okay.

1895
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,870
As long as I keep cutting trees, it'll be fine.

1896
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:29,930
Oh, guys.

1897
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,090
This is...

1898
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:33,910
This is not fun no more.

1899
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:37,210
This is not fun no more.

1900
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:40,490
I didn't think they would that strong.

1901
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:42,330
Oh, my God.

1902
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:44,010
Please, Sorava.

1903
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:46,170
Sorava, no.

1904
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,450
And there's more.

1905
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,700
Oh, no.

1906
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:58,360
My last slaughterhouse.

1907
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,460
Guys.

1908
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,140
Guys.

1909
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,840
I think I really, really hate...

1910
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,360
I think the dwarves were right.

1911
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,720
I think the dwarves were right.

1912
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:25,280
Oh, my God.

1913
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,100
Oh, my God.

1914
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:28,800
Of course, they...

1915
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,380
I think if we remove the elves...

1916
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:41,200
If we remove the elves from this world, nothing good would be... Nothing would be lost.

1917
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,780
That's all I'm saying.

1918
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,980
And you can't be like, that's racist, Doki.

1919
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:51,900
Because the elves are, like, the most racist of us all.

1920
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,620
You can't say that.

1921
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,780
Elves are even more racist than any of us.

1922
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,500
So, like, in the end, they deserve it.

1923
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:09,870
Can't be racist because it's true.

1924
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:10,830
Alright.

1925
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:11,970
You know what?

1926
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:14,170
We don't... Let's just...

1927
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:17,630
Let's... Let's go to the other... Let's do the other one.

1928
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:18,330
Let's...

1929
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,490
Let's... You know what?

1930
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:23,570
We don't need the... Guys.

1931
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:24,150
Guys.

1932
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:27,250
We don't need to take over the forest, guys.

1933
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,610
We don't need the forest.

1934
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:36,550
That's fine.

1935
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:38,170
We'll be here.

1936
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,110
We'll be here.

1937
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:41,330
We'll be here.

1938
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,510
Things will be easier.

1939
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:45,530
I believe.

1940
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:49,990
Let's not rush into it this time.

1941
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:50,910
Let's just chill.

1942
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:53,450
Guys, we'll just...

1943
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:54,770
We'll just chill here.

1944
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,910
We won't rush into it this time.

1945
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:02,630
We'll chill.

1946
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:06,810
We're gonna chill here.

1947
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,410
We're gonna...

1948
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:11,970
We're just gonna relax.

1949
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:14,330
We don't have to rush into it.

1950
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,390
Things will be okay this time.

1951
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:21,310
Anything here?

1952
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,970
What the fuck?

1953
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:27,550
What the fuck?

1954
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,010
I just got here!

1955
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,190
What the fuck?

1956
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:32,790
I just got here!

1957
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,870
Okay, we gotta build this.

1958
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,330
That's so fucked up.

1959
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,750
I literally just got here and they were like...

1960
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,970
They assaulted...

1961
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:50,150
They actually went in so fast.

1962
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:51,770
Okay.

1963
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:55,150
Let's defend here.

1964
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:56,850
Let's go here for defense.

1965
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,310
And then we'll keep building this.

1966
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:00,410
Cause I don't...

1967
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:01,850
How?

1968
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:03,370
Oh, Saruman.

1969
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,590
Sorry, Saruman will be fine.

1970
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,490
I believe in him.

1971
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:13,330
I believe in the power...

1972
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,270
Oh, it's just humans.

1973
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:15,470
We're fine.

1974
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:16,350
It's just people.

1975
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,450
Oh, fuck!

1976
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:20,010
Okay.

1977
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:20,930
Alright, Saruman.

1978
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:23,750
You're getting a little too cocky right now.

1979
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:26,610
Alright, let's just chill here for a little bit.

1980
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,110
You're getting a little too cocky.

1981
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,390
We'll build more resources.

1982
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,290
And then we should build another...

1983
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:36,310
We'll build another furnace.

1984
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,710
Alright.

1985
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:41,670
Let's do Saruman and this guy.

1986
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:47,610
The fuck?

1987
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:48,830
Shoot back!

1988
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:49,710
Are you really gonna...

1989
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,450
Shoot back!

1990
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:56,070
Okay, we need a thousand... Okay, I want to build another furnace too.

1991
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:58,690
Alright, things are fine.

1992
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:00,090
Everything is okay, guys.

1993
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:01,210
Everything is okay.

1994
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:02,370
Okay.

1995
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:03,430
Help him.

1996
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:05,670
Oh.

1997
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:07,350
Oh, okay.

1998
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,130
Okay.

1999
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:11,830
Oh, that's awkward.

2000
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,990
Oh, that's... Whoa!

2001
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:16,990
How did you didn't get this?

2002
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:17,890
Okay.

2003
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,410
Oh, that's awkward.

2004
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:21,850
Okay, that's a little awkward.

2005
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:25,070
How the fuck do they send an entire army?

2006
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:25,150
Please!

2007
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:30,430
Okay.

2008
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:32,770
This is fine.

2009
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:34,470
This is fine.

2010
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,590
We'll make another rock base.

2011
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:41,570
Oh, I don't think I can defend myself a second time.

2012
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:45,550
Oh, this is... Oh, this is awkward.

2013
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:47,470
It's okay.

2014
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:48,350
I'll cut these trees.

2015
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:49,950
We'll have our resources.

2016
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:51,190
Alright, we have resources.

2017
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:53,350
Everything is okay.

2018
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,350
Everything is healthy.

2019
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:55,910
We're so healthy.

2020
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:57,650
We're so healthy.

2021
01:21:58,570 --> 01:21:59,590
We're so very healthy.

2022
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:03,250
Everyone,

2023
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:13,090
just keep defending.

2024
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,010
Just keep defending.

2025
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:16,830
Just keep defending.

2026
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:19,770
Nothing to worry about.

2027
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:21,810
Just keep Defending.

2028
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:28,010
Um, we'll have Saruman back and then everything will be fine.

2029
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:32,070
Oh.

2030
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,210
All right, there we go.

2031
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,930
We're so healthy.

2032
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:35,450
We're still so healthy.

2033
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,730
Oh, everything will be okay.

2034
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:40,430
Everything will be okay.

2035
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:46,950
Everything will be... Why do they get all of this?

2036
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:52,910
Okay, um, all right, we just need a forge.

2037
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:58,470
I need a... I need to buy the armory, but like, oh my god, I need more money.

2038
01:22:58,870 --> 01:22:59,930
I need more money.

2039
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:02,310
It's okay, I'll just build another...

2040
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:05,150
I'll build another... I'll build another this.

2041
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:14,890
And then... and then I can put a berserker in here and then we'll have Saruman back and then things will be fine.

2042
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:18,650
Things will be so healthy for us, guys.

2043
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,170
I believe.

2044
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:23,490
Okay, I'm gonna explore and see if I can get another base.

2045
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:25,190
We need another base right now.

2046
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:27,570
It's okay.

2047
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:29,730
Evil always wins, right?

2048
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:34,790
I never finished Lord of the Rings, but I'm pretty sure it's Surround 1, right guys?

2049
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:40,890
Right, guys?

2050
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:42,130
Yeah, I see.

2051
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:46,590
Yeah, yeah.

2052
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:51,370
As he should, right?

2053
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:56,730
Yeah, Surround 1.

2054
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:59,470
Yeah, how could he lose?

2055
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:00,370
You know, you're right.

2056
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:01,770
How could he lose?

2057
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:06,530
Just how I remember it.

2058
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:09,650
Yeah, I wish he would never lose.

2059
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,570
So, evil always prevails.

2060
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:15,370
Don't worry, he's back.

2061
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:16,190
See, look.

2062
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:16,890
He's back.

2063
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:18,810
None shall oppose us.

2064
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:20,250
I knew he'd make it.

2065
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,430
Okay, I need a thousand three hundred.

2066
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:25,770
It should be almost there.

2067
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:30,170
I'm gonna wait until I have a thousand surrenders so I can build the armory.

2068
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:33,330
Okay, let me check here.

2069
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,830
Okay, I could take over their farms here.

2070
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:40,850
Yeah, these are just regular people, right?

2071
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:43,210
Oh, shit!

2072
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:44,190
What the fuck?

2073
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,490
What the fuck?

2074
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,450
The fuck are you doing here?

2075
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:56,790
Get in there, Berserker!

2076
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:02,370
Wait, are these just regular people?

2077
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:03,970
Even better.

2078
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:08,390
Even better.

2079
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:13,950
All right, all right.

2080
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:14,970
I should have enough now.

2081
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:18,630
Furnace, furnace.

2082
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:19,970
Let's build another.

2083
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:22,690
All right.

2084
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,770
I'll put this here and then we go in.

2085
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:29,730
We're gonna pillage, guys.

2086
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:32,550
Just like how my Oshu always wanted.

2087
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:34,430
We pillage.

2088
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:38,990
What are you gonna do?

2089
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:40,010
Fight back?

2090
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:42,110
Oh, shit!

2091
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:43,110
Oh, shit!

2092
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:47,610
Wait, wait, they fight back?

2093
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,110
Oh my god!

2094
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:56,150
That's not how I remembered.

2095
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:01,250
They can fight back?

2096
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:07,370
Okay, wait, where's my- oh, there it is.

2097
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:09,970
Okay, heavy armor.

2098
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,330
Okay, we need all these upgrades.

2099
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:13,570
Nice.

2100
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:14,650
My farm now.

2101
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:17,050
Now they're fighting back.

2102
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:17,830
I know!

2103
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,970
That's so illegal!

2104
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,180
Wait, what?

2105
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,120
Where's the cave troll?

2106
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,020
Okay, get the trees in.

2107
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,720
We need trees.

2108
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,860
All right, kill them!

2109
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,500
They're defenseless!

2110
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,240
Kill them!

2111
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,200
Oh my god, they're defenseless!

2112
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,540
My favorite!

2113
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,900
I shouldn't imagine what the one ring would do to Toki.

2114
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:55,460
Nice.

2115
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,100
All right, nice.

2116
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,060
We have money, too.

2117
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,140
We need that money.

2118
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,260
All right, good.

2119
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,760
Oh my god, they're trying to run away!

2120
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,240
Get her!

2121
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,320
Get her!

2122
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,020
No mercy.

2123
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,120
I can't believe they would try and run away.

2124
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:12,920
Wait, what?

2125
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:15,120
Where?

2126
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:16,340
No, they're not.

2127
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,160
Okay, let's grab the gold here.

2128
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:22,100
Oh my god, these guys are so much more easier than elves.

2129
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:26,180
It's like they're like- it's like they're like innocent civilians or something.

2130
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:28,700
Wait, where?

2131
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:29,820
Oh shit!

2132
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:30,200
Okay.

2133
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:34,860
All right, that's fine.

2134
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,440
No worries.

2135
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,680
I'm coming back.

2136
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:38,340
Don't worry.

2137
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,200
They'll never expect a back shot.

2138
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,260
I also need to cut these trees, too.

2139
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:49,120
Let me- let me cut these trees just for extra.

2140
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:51,580
Okay, nice.

2141
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,340
And then I need to upgrade these and...

2142
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,560
All right.

2143
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,480
Okay, get ready.

2144
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,200
Save- save our trees.

2145
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:05,320
All right.

2146
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:05,980
Oh shit.

2147
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:06,740
Oh.

2148
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,700
All right, Sarma, I need you to help me.

2149
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,640
I need you to help me over here.

2150
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,880
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

2151
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,280
Wait, Sarma, are you just gonna let them- what the fuck, Sarma?

2152
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,080
Sarma's like, they can handle this.

2153
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:26,900
They'll be fine.

2154
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:28,920
They can handle this.

2155
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:29,440
You know what?

2156
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,100
Fuck it.

2157
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,600
You guys get all the upgrades.

2158
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:36,200
Oh, that would be so fucked if, like, before they get this upgrade, they all just die.

2159
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,520
No, they'll be fine, right?

2160
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:42,240
Oh shit.

2161
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:50,240
Okay, um, let me grab all of these guys real fast and put them here.

2162
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:52,680
And then- oh shit, my trees!

2163
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,000
No!

2164
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,220
My trees!

2165
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,780
Not my trees!

2166
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:10,300
They're gonna build a- oh, I'm mad.

2167
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,360
I'm fucking mad.

2168
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,140
I'm mad.

2169
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:17,760
I can't believe they just built it over.

2170
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,920
That's so fucked.

2171
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,560
That's actually fucked.

2172
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,160
I can't believe they just did that.

2173
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,380
They just, like, built over my thing.

2174
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,140
Oh my god.

2175
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,300
They just built over it.

2176
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,300
Again?

2177
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:43,080
Oh my god, please.

2178
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,140
Please, for the love of- stop.

2179
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,320
Just stop.

2180
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,740
Please, just stop.

2181
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:51,680
Let me, like, have a moment.

2182
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,020
Let me- it's- everything is so fast, I don't even have time to fucking breathe.

2183
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,260
Species, thank you for the 10 gifted chips.

2184
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,360
Thank you, thank you.

2185
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:06,600
Holy shit, everything is so fast.

2186
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,940
I swear to god, I have, like, no time to actually, like, process what the fuck I have to do.

2187
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:15,640
I just have to, like- I'm just going in and things happen.

2188
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:25,200
Okay, all right, I need to grab- I need to put this and then- do I even have money?

2189
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,800
I don't, it's 2000.

2190
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,260
I need- I need, like, money.

2191
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:34,040
It's almost like you gotta do it in real time.

2192
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,820
Okay, we slowly surround them.

2193
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,100
I believe.

2194
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:41,820
Okay, we need to make sure all of us is fully upgraded, though.

2195
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,780
All right, Tormund, you- you guard this one area yourself.

2196
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:46,760
I believe in you.

2197
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,920
All right, look at all these guys getting ready.

2198
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,280
Okay, we'll guard here.

2199
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,400
All right, shoot back.

2200
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:02,460
Guys, are you really- oh my god, do I need to, like- oh my- they didn't even shoot back!

2201
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:03,720
Guys!

2202
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,240
Shoot back!

2203
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,240
Guys, oh my god.

2204
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,360
Guys, do I have to hold your hand?

2205
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:12,480
Do I actually have to hold your hand?

2206
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,180
They, like- they just let them shoot them.

2207
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:17,940
Okay, things- everything's fine.

2208
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:18,760
Everything's fine.

2209
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,540
Everything is so- okay.

2210
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,200
All right, we just gotta- I wanna make enough so I can make this.

2211
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:32,320
My evil raider orcs are not known for their intelligence.

2212
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,660
Like, what are you doing?

2213
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,320
They're just shooting you for free!

2214
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,620
It's all right.

2215
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:41,800
He's got this.

2216
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:42,460
Like this.

2217
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:44,900
Goodbye.

2218
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:46,540
Nice.

2219
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,200
See, I told you that he can take those.

2220
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,420
He can take them.

2221
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,860
Okay, that has to be a big house.

2222
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,240
Nice.

2223
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:54,960
Okay, that's good.

2224
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,160
That's good that this is a big house.

2225
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:07,000
All right, and then I And then I'll make one for units.

2226
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,040
And then... arrow.

2227
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,260
Arrow.

2228
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:12,620
Surma's fine, right?

2229
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,200
Surma, please!

2230
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,180
You're getting shot at!

2231
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,840
Surma, please!

2232
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,800
Don't just let them shoot you!

2233
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,280
You're stronger than them!

2234
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:32,940
Okay, nice.

2235
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,780
I don't like how he just lets it happen sometimes.

2236
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,380
I don't like how he just sits there and be like, okay.

2237
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,520
He's just- it's like he wants to die!

2238
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,680
It's like- okay, money.

2239
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,480
Okay.

2240
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:53,340
All right.

2241
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:54,160
Oh, fuck.

2242
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,260
Oh, fuck.

2243
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:55,780
Okay.

2244
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:58,820
Okay, Surma definitely won't- okay.

2245
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,200
It's fine.

2246
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:02,280
Everything is fine.

2247
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:06,390
Oh, fuck.

2248
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:07,570
Okay, everything is fine.

2249
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:08,630
I just do this.

2250
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:11,630
Inspire!

2251
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:14,830
There we go!

2252
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:17,910
I believe!

2253
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:19,910
Fire!

2254
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:23,130
There we go.

2255
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:25,230
And then we chop the trees!

2256
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:26,950
Tree chop!

2257
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:29,650
Okay.

2258
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:33,210
All right, we just gotta upgrade everybody and then we should be fine.

2259
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:38,050
Don't worry!

2260
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,170
There's no way he'll die!

2261
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:42,090
Oh, wait!

2262
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:44,230
I forgot you can integrate!

2263
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,930
Oh my god, I forgot about that!

2264
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:48,750
Become one!

2265
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:53,150
I forgot you can integrate together!

2266
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:55,090
Wait!

2267
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:58,830
Okay, I forgot about that.

2268
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:01,530
All right, you guys are best friends now.

2269
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:03,330
We're best friends.

2270
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:05,450
Okay, we're ready.

2271
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,830
We're so ready.

2272
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:11,970
Oh my god, I forgot about the integration.

2273
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,990
Okay, we're so ready.

2274
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:19,630
I think we're ready.

2275
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:22,010
I think we're ready.

2276
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:23,870
They're attacking us!

2277
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:24,610
Kill them!

2278
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:26,030
Goodbye!

2279
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:30,910
Our Berserker is almost dead, but that's okay!

2280
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:36,550
Okay, I'm gonna put these guys here and then...

2281
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:40,190
All right, things will be okay.

2282
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:42,330
All right, guys!

2283
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:43,570
We can do this!

2284
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:45,530
I believe in us!

2285
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:49,870
I don't know what this does, but...

2286
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:55,110
I don't know what it does, but fuck it!

2287
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:57,670
That's how I like to play my video games.

2288
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:00,950
I could have read it, but like fuck it.

2289
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:01,590
All right, so...

2290
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:04,150
It's time!

2291
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:07,370
It's time!

2292
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:11,950
It's time!

2293
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:11,950
It's time!

2294
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:12,550
Go!

2295
01:35:15,130 --> 01:35:17,170
We fight!

2296
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:21,890
Oh my god, we can't get past!

2297
01:35:22,030 --> 01:35:23,370
We're stuck!

2298
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:25,150
It's okay!

2299
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:27,290
We're stuck, but it's...

2300
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:30,410
It's okay!

2301
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:32,790
We're stuck but that's all right!

2302
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:44,170
I don't know, I think I'm doing it.

2303
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:48,170
It's fine!

2304
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:50,190
Just do whatever the fuck you want!

2305
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:52,630
Just kill everything!

2306
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,610
I believe!

2307
01:35:58,150 --> 01:35:58,750
There we go!

2308
01:35:58,890 --> 01:35:59,670
Just kill everything!

2309
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:03,150
Die for... die for us!

2310
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,030
Wait, what's this?

2311
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,570
There we go, nice!

2312
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,590
We did it, guys!

2313
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:13,990
I think we're winning.

2314
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:15,650
Are we winning?

2315
01:36:16,050 --> 01:36:16,490
I...

2316
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:18,930
You know what?

2317
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:21,290
Fuck it, let's all just fuck this one building up.

2318
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:22,330
Let's go.

2319
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:25,230
I'll even use fire.

2320
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:26,490
Let's go.

2321
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:27,130
You know what?

2322
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:27,910
Fuck it.

2323
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:30,510
They don't know the horses, they're confused!

2324
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:32,290
They're so confused!

2325
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:35,910
That's it!

2326
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:37,370
I'm gonna take you down!

2327
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:40,050
That's right!

2328
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:42,490
Oh, wait, this doesn't work against horses.

2329
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:44,230
I just figured it out.

2330
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:45,870
It doesn't work against horses, guys.

2331
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:49,470
Look at that.

2332
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:53,550
Let me cut up some trees just for good luck.

2333
01:36:54,210 --> 01:36:55,670
Just fuck these trees in general.

2334
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:59,890
It's okay, Suramon, you'll be fine, Suramon.

2335
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:01,250
Guys, I don't think...

2336
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,390
Guys, I think he might die.

2337
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,310
It's okay, I can rebuild him.

2338
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:07,830
I can rebuild him.

2339
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:08,510
I can...

2340
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:10,870
What do we do?

2341
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:11,870
He's dead!

2342
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:12,810
It's okay, guys.

2343
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:14,430
I can rebuild him, guys.

2344
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:16,190
I can rebuild him!

2345
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:19,810
How is he still making horses?!

2346
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:25,070
How is he still making horses?

2347
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:27,190
It's okay.

2348
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:29,250
Things will be fine.

2349
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:31,970
Wait, they took over?

2350
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:34,930
Wait, what?

2351
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:37,150
They took over my farm at the last second?

2352
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:41,910
Oh shit.

2353
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:42,950
Wait a minute.

2354
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,310
Wait, they're recovering.

2355
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:45,990
How is that possible?

2356
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:47,890
They're recovering.

2357
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:50,570
How is that possible?

2358
01:37:50,910 --> 01:37:52,370
Stop making horses!

2359
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:53,830
Stop!

2360
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:57,870
I can't do anything about it!

2361
01:37:57,970 --> 01:38:00,170
They keep making horses!

2362
01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:02,710
Get these horses out of here!

2363
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:05,870
Oh my god.

2364
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:06,770
Get them out.

2365
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:08,750
Get them out.

2366
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,570
Stop!

2367
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:10,670
Stop!

2368
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:16,450
Oh my god.

2369
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:19,970
They keep making horses.

2370
01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:21,310
I don't know what to do.

2371
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:24,030
They keep making horses, guys.

2372
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:26,650
What the fuck do I do?

2373
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:31,430
I'm literally... I died because of this!

2374
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:33,970
Because... Oh my god!

2375
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:40,750
I can't believe I died because of the fucking horses.

2376
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:42,990
I'm so mad.

2377
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:45,790
I'm so mad.

2378
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:47,390
Oh my god.

2379
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:50,530
It's because of the stupid fucking horses.

2380
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:53,290
That's actually crazy.

2381
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:58,510
That's actually crazy.

2382
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:03,810
The horses actually won!

2383
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:08,850
The power of... What the fuck?

2384
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:09,710
Get them out!

2385
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:11,670
Get them

2386
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:16,520
out of here!

2387
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,400
Get them out!

2388
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,080
Oh my god.

2389
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:23,580
The stupid fucking farm.

2390
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:27,000
Oh my god.

2391
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:28,440
Get the farm out!

2392
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,660
Curse of Genghis Khan.

2393
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:32,840
Bro, I swear to god.

2394
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:33,820
I swear to god.

2395
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:35,580
If you make another... I swear to god.

2396
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:36,540
If you make another farm.

2397
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:38,940
I swear to fucking god.

2398
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:39,880
Get out.

2399
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,420
Oh my god.

2400
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,780
Get the fuck out!

2401
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:45,780
Oh my god.

2402
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,460
You stupid villager.

2403
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:49,680
Oh my god.

2404
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:50,980
They're doing this again!

2405
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:54,020
Part two.

2406
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,660
The stupid fucking farm is still going.

2407
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:04,040
I'm fucking sending the entire army to destroy this one farm.

2408
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,460
I don't care.

2409
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:07,600
I do not care.

2410
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:08,460
Get out.

2411
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:09,500
This is my farm.

2412
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,760
This is my...

2413
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:16,460
This is my fucking farm.

2414
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,940
Jesus Christ.

2415
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,320
This stupid fucking farm.

2416
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,040
Kill him.

2417
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:26,620
Kill him.

2418
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:28,780
Fucking kill him.

2419
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:32,860
It's Lord Ackroyd.

2420
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,380
These stupid horses.

2421
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:40,640
I'm gonna... I'm gonna come over and fucking send a fireball into these horses.

2422
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:42,640
I don't fucking care.

2423
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:45,760
Send a fireball.

2424
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:46,500
Kill them.

2425
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,280
There we go.

2426
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:49,820
Get them out of here.

2427
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,160
Alright.

2428
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,080
Oh my god.

2429
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,160
How many horses?

2430
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,020
How many?

2431
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,580
Oh my... Oh my god.

2432
01:40:58,640 --> 01:40:59,900
They fucking rebuild.

2433
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:01,540
I'm cutting these trees.

2434
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:02,040
Okay.

2435
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:03,380
Get over here.

2436
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:04,320
I don't care.

2437
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,980
I'm fucking destroying this.

2438
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:08,580
This is a... I don't care.

2439
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:12,600
Get these horses first.

2440
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,220
Saurabhine, who cares?

2441
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:15,800
Your mission?

2442
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:16,980
Destroy this.

2443
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:19,980
I don't care.

2444
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,540
Saurabhine, you won't die just to kill this.

2445
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,220
I don't... I don't care.

2446
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,040
No, help him.

2447
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,040
Help Saurabhine.

2448
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,480
Help him.

2449
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,680
Destroy the horse building.

2450
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:34,940
Destroy the horse building.

2451
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:37,140
Stop everything else.

2452
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:41,380
That's... Get the horses.

2453
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:44,120
Oh my... Okay, now you can do whatever.

2454
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:45,960
Oh my god.

2455
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:49,900
That's all we need you to destroy.

2456
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,780
We just need you to destroy the horse building.

2457
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:54,680
Alright.

2458
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:57,500
That's fine.

2459
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:59,480
Now you can do whatever the fuck you want.

2460
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,040
Fuck it.

2461
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:00,820
Destroy this farm.

2462
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,920
Oh my god.

2463
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:06,180
Are these villagers fucking crazy?

2464
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,060
There we go.

2465
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:11,140
Alright.

2466
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,680
Everything is okay now.

2467
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,580
I... I almost lost because of the horses.

2468
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:17,380
I...

2469
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:21,080
The great Heisenberg.

2470
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,420
God, this is still unstable.

2471
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:26,220
They just wouldn't stop.

2472
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:28,900
They kept making horses.

2473
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:30,160
Like, I don't understand.

2474
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:35,040
Where do they get all these horses from?

2475
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:38,980
Where do they all come from?

2476
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,640
Where do they all come from?

2477
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,060
Stop.

2478
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:46,060
Stop.

2479
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,700
Defenseless humans.

2480
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:48,580
Stop.

2481
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:55,480
The world could use... That took way too long.

2482
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:59,640
Let's just try the 1v1 Saurabhine.

2483
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,920
Jesus Christ.

2484
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:08,300
Okay, you... Bro, that took way too long.

2485
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,620
That took... This is medium.

2486
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:12,420
I don't understand.

2487
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:21,000
It's just like... They were like popping out like fucking rabbits.

2488
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:25,520
Horses do not... Horses take years to be bred.

2489
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,600
But... But why...

2490
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:34,020
Why the fuck... Why were they being popped out like rabbits?

2491
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:35,880
It just kept coming.

2492
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,320
It never stopped.

2493
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:38,800
It never stopped.

2494
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,560
I survived.

2495
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:44,560
I fucking survived the great horse war.

2496
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:48,160
The whole army gone because of horses.

2497
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:50,880
Oh my god.

2498
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:53,740
It's a magic joke.

2499
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:01,950
Oh my god.

2500
01:44:02,130 --> 01:44:05,210
Who taught these humans to breed their horses?

2501
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:10,610
I thought they were regular people.

2502
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:12,030
I don't understand.

2503
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:14,410
Alright, it's okay.

2504
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:18,130
We got... We got Rohan.

2505
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:19,210
We can do it.

2506
01:44:19,950 --> 01:44:21,150
We got Rohan.

2507
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:23,730
When the fuck do I get my wolf riders?

2508
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:34,780
Oh my god.

2509
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:43,780
When the fuck... When the fuck do I get to... When the fuck do I get to have my riders?

2510
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:47,900
It is Rohan, land of the horse lads.

2511
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,280
Oh fuck.

2512
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:56,100
Okay.

2513
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:58,340
That was very exhausting.

2514
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:06,500
Merry Pippin!

2515
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,070
That's me!

2516
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:12,250
I win, right?

2517
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:22,080
Oh my god.

2518
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:24,140
This is just like the movies when I kill them.

2519
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:28,310
Alright.

2520
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:29,610
Here we go.

2521
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:35,450
Wait, what?

2522
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:36,090
What's wrong?

2523
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:38,570
Oh shit.

2524
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:40,770
What can they do?

2525
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:43,430
Oh shit.

2526
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:43,990
Guys!

2527
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:49,430
Guys, how did we... Oh guys, I fucked up already.

2528
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:51,490
Okay, that's fine.

2529
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:55,790
It's fine.

2530
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:00,170
This is... It's fine.

2531
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:02,990
You know what?

2532
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:04,590
I can take all of these myself.

2533
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,790
I can take them.

2534
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:11,390
I can totally take them.

2535
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:14,790
Do they have like special abilities?

2536
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:16,730
Oh!

2537
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:18,570
I can toggle the weapon.

2538
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:19,190
You know what?

2539
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,610
Fuck it.

2540
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:21,070
One of them should be both.

2541
01:46:22,830 --> 01:46:23,830
Okay, let's go.

2542
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:30,430
Let's just grab more guys here and then let's get some money too real quick.

2543
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,330
Alright, nice.

2544
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:34,350
Everything will be fine.

2545
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:36,130
As always, guys.

2546
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:37,530
Everything will be so fine.

2547
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:38,950
Everything will be so fine.

2548
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:43,170
I believe in us.

2549
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:46,570
Okay, let's grab some heals.

2550
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:47,550
It's okay.

2551
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:48,830
They're not gonna run away.

2552
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:52,890
We'll be fine.

2553
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:54,450
No way they can run away.

2554
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:57,030
There's no way, right?

2555
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:00,550
Oh shit.

2556
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:02,390
Okay.

2557
01:47:05,630 --> 01:47:06,650
Alright, it's fine.

2558
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:07,510
See, look at that.

2559
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:08,730
Famous last words.

2560
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:09,430
What are you gonna do?

2561
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:09,950
Run away?

2562
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:14,620
Okay, let's bring over here.

2563
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:15,860
Let's put more people here.

2564
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:19,820
That's right.

2565
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,300
Flee!

2566
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,540
You think I'm scared?

2567
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,540
I literally just beat up some trees.

2568
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:27,740
I beat up horses.

2569
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:31,620
You think I'm scared?

2570
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:33,120
I'm literally beat up.

2571
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,880
Wait, take control of the summit of Amon Hen?

2572
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:37,480
Is this summit of Amon Hen?

2573
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:39,680
Is that it?

2574
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:42,940
Oh shit!

2575
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:43,920
What the fuck?

2576
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:44,980
What did I do?

2577
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,120
Oh, I did it.

2578
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,060
I just ran through.

2579
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:53,340
I did it.

2580
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,340
I just ran through.

2581
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:55,500
It's that easy.

2582
01:47:58,060 --> 01:47:59,700
Bro, fucking kill them!

2583
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:01,800
Kill them!

2584
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:11,930
Oh my god.

2585
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:16,940
It's not that difficult!

2586
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,180
Just shoot them!

2587
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:21,200
Oh shit.

2588
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,780
Okay, maybe it is a little difficult, guys.

2589
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:24,900
Maybe...

2590
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,080
Oh shit.

2591
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:29,440
Oh shit.

2592
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:30,540
Oh shit.

2593
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:30,860
No!

2594
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:34,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2595
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,040
Oh, fuck off!

2596
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,360
It's okay.

2597
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:40,060
Okay, you guys, you guys chill.

2598
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:44,920
You guys, you guys chill a little bit.

2599
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,920
Guys, it was a little...

2600
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:52,020
Guys, it was definitely a lot more difficult than I expected, guys.

2601
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,960
It was... yeah, yeah.

2602
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:57,220
Who would have thought?

2603
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,160
Who would have thought they were a lot stronger?

2604
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,700
Yeah, they do a lot of damage!

2605
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:06,700
Who would have thought?

2606
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:12,480
Oh my god, those fucking elves!

2607
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:14,800
I blame the elves.

2608
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:15,780
It's okay.

2609
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,260
These two will just chill a little bit until I figure out what to do.

2610
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:22,700
Fight back!

2611
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:23,200
What?

2612
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:26,170
Holy shit!

2613
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:29,690
Who is this one guy that's killing me?

2614
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:32,870
Oh my god, no wonder!

2615
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:40,250
One fucking... I was like, who is that guy fucking 1v6ing me?

2616
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:42,810
Oh, that makes a lot of sense now.

2617
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:45,610
Okay, I realize why.

2618
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:47,770
Guys, I understand now.

2619
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:48,830
I understand.

2620
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:50,410
Is he still alive?

2621
01:49:50,690 --> 01:49:51,830
Okay, guys, we did it.

2622
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:52,630
We killed Gimli.

2623
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:55,510
We fucking did it.

2624
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:57,250
Guys, we rewrote history.

2625
01:49:57,410 --> 01:49:58,270
We killed Gimli.

2626
01:49:59,690 --> 01:50:01,150
We fucking did it.

2627
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:05,350
We... OH MY GOD, AND THEN THERE'S LEGOLAS!

2628
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:10,340
NOT TO DEAL WITH LEGOLAS!

2629
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:11,880
Oh no!

2630
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:14,380
Oh my god!

2631
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,660
Okay, that's fine.

2632
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:17,300
That's fine.

2633
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,580
I can do it again.

2634
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,880
Oh my god, it's okay.

2635
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:25,740
Legolas is a... Oh, we did it!

2636
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,640
We rewrote history yet again!

2637
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:31,440
We did it!

2638
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,660
Oh my god, we fucking did it!

2639
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:36,840
Oh my god!

2640
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:43,520
Oh my god, who would've thought that got a lot easier when we killed him?

2641
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,540
The fellowship has ended, just like in the movies.

2642
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,700
What an ending, guys!

2643
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:54,280
We did it.

2644
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:56,280
Wait, reinforcements?

2645
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:57,520
Are you serious?

2646
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:58,760
They got away?

2647
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,080
How?

2648
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:02,520
I killed them!

2649
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,120
Wait, how did... How?

2650
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:11,120
Kill all the heroes and the hobbits.

2651
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:12,480
No.

2652
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:13,980
No.

2653
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,340
We can't let them take that boat.

2654
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,820
Wait, that's not fair!

2655
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:21,460
Wait, that's not fair!

2656
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,480
That's... Wait, that's absolutely not fair!

2657
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:31,380
Okay.

2658
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:35,040
Alright, it's fine.

2659
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,400
It's fine.

2660
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,520
Oh, it's not fine.

2661
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:40,660
It's not fine, but it's also fine.

2662
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:43,640
It's fine.

2663
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:48,380
Where's my... Where is he?

2664
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:53,060
Wait, the fucking horse... Oh my god.

2665
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:54,940
I'm trying.

2666
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:58,220
I'm trying my best right now.

2667
01:51:58,860 --> 01:51:59,240
No!

2668
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,360
My fucking trees!

2669
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,080
Not the... Where's the pikes?

2670
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:08,860
Where's the... I don't have pikes!

2671
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:12,240
What do you mean, pikes?

2672
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:13,720
What do you mean?

2673
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:18,800
How do I make pikes, guys?

2674
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:21,640
Wait, where is he?

2675
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,880
Wait, where is he?

2676
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:26,420
Where's Olok?

2677
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,200
Wait, where did Olok go?

2678
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:29,760
Olok!

2679
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,100
It's bugged?

2680
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,760
I can't make... Oh, wait!

2681
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:49,840
I can make my pikemen!

2682
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,480
Oh god.

2683
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:53,860
Oh god!

2684
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,980
Oh my god, they realized I had pikemen!

2685
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,640
Get the horses.

2686
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:01,780
Get the horses.

2687
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:03,780
Okay, I have one guy left.

2688
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:07,960
Oh my god!

2689
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:10,800
Okay, okay, okay.

2690
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,380
I got pike... Guys, I did it!

2691
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,520
My first pikemen, guys!

2692
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:16,340
I did it!

2693
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:17,920
Get together!

2694
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,520
Oh my god, finally!

2695
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,980
I am no longer afraid of horses!

2696
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:30,560
I am no longer... I'm no longer... No!

2697
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:32,280
I'm fucked up!

2698
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:37,740
I didn't wait for my trees!

2699
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:39,380
Oh, fuck!

2700
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:42,120
Okay, I messed up a little bit, guys.

2701
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:45,800
I messed up a little bit and forgot to...

2702
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:49,720
Guys, it's okay.

2703
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,620
We just need to wait four minutes, guys.

2704
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:57,160
I can... Wait, there's gold here.

2705
01:53:57,660 --> 01:53:59,040
Guys, guys, it's okay.

2706
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:02,340
We're gonna be saved by this random gold pile.

2707
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,000
There we go!

2708
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:06,180
Oh my god, we can make trees again.

2709
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:08,080
We can make trees again!

2710
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,480
Oh my god!

2711
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:13,740
Oh, thank god!

2712
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,340
Oh, we have reinforcements!

2713
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,140
It's okay.

2714
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:23,640
We have... We have cave trolls!

2715
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:26,060
Guys, look at that!

2716
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:28,440
Nothing to worry about, guys.

2717
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:31,260
Nothing to worry about.

2718
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,460
We're okay.

2719
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:35,100
Alright, never punish!

2720
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:35,800
Let's go!

2721
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:37,020
Never punish, guys!

2722
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:38,180
Never punish!

2723
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,120
Alright, here we go.

2724
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:42,720
We did it.

2725
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,300
We lost one guy, but we did it.

2726
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:46,440
We lost...

2727
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:49,300
Let's put him right here!

2728
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:52,400
Nothing bad happened.

2729
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:54,700
Nothing bad happened.

2730
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:00,500
Alright, there we go.

2731
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:01,220
Go in!

2732
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:03,320
Go in!

2733
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:06,280
Let's go!

2734
01:55:07,120 --> 01:55:08,000
That's right!

2735
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:10,520
Fight!

2736
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,040
Fight!

2737
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:11,600
Fight!

2738
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:13,660
That's good.

2739
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:14,040
That's good.

2740
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,780
Okay, then I can build more pikemen.

2741
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:17,880
And I'll put them right here.

2742
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:21,300
And then things will be... Oh my god, I got my trolls too.

2743
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:23,680
I got my trolls.

2744
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:26,160
See, look at that!

2745
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:27,480
Nothing bad has happened!

2746
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:32,780
It's not like I was economically fucked for a minute!

2747
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,220
Guys, it's fine!

2748
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:35,920
Look at that!

2749
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,280
Nothing bad ever happens to me!

2750
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:41,860
Okay, we have to go this way.

2751
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:44,980
Yeah, we have to go this way.

2752
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:46,540
Alright, ogres.

2753
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:48,900
It's okay.

2754
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:54,670
Oh shit!

2755
01:55:54,770 --> 01:55:56,150
What the fuck?!

2756
01:55:58,570 --> 01:55:59,530
Oh shit!

2757
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:02,670
How the fuck?!

2758
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:04,010
What the fuck?!

2759
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:04,710
Wait!

2760
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:06,430
What the fuck?!

2761
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:08,410
Who are these people?!

2762
01:56:09,850 --> 01:56:11,510
They just killed everybody!

2763
01:56:12,810 --> 01:56:13,330
What?!

2764
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:20,690
What the fuck?!

2765
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:24,670
What happened?!

2766
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:29,110
Is this... Oh my god, it was you!

2767
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:32,710
It was you!

2768
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:34,310
I'm coming over!

2769
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:36,630
I'm fucking coming over!

2770
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:38,090
I will kill this hobbit!

2771
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:39,910
Oh my god, it's Aragorn!

2772
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:42,110
Oh my god!

2773
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:45,580
It's Aragorn!

2774
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:46,400
Pippin!

2775
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,920
And who the fuck is this guy?

2776
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:49,640
Merry, okay.

2777
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,420
My dad died so fast!

2778
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:54,940
Jesus Christ!

2779
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:57,120
They're all here!

2780
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,080
The whole family is here!

2781
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:02,740
Jesus!

2782
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:04,300
Did I even kill...

2783
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:05,200
Oh my god, get him!

2784
01:57:05,420 --> 01:57:05,880
Get him!

2785
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:07,420
One angry troll!

2786
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:08,780
Oh, that's right!

2787
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:10,460
Who's this guy?

2788
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:12,440
Haldir?!

2789
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:14,420
Why are they all here?!

2790
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:15,320
Do I just win?

2791
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:19,220
Do I just take over the lands after?

2792
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,440
Wait, guys.

2793
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:26,260
If I kill them all, then I should just win, right?

2794
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,000
Wait, I should just win after that!

2795
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,260
They'd just all be dead!

2796
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:34,960
What is Haldir doing here?

2797
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:37,600
What is he doing?

2798
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:39,120
Let's ignore Merry.

2799
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:40,240
He's not that important.

2800
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:41,320
Wait, is this Pippin?

2801
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:43,360
Let's just ignore Pippin.

2802
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:44,480
He's not that important.

2803
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:45,020
You don't know.

2804
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:45,500
Fuck it.

2805
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,360
Let's all just fuck up Pippin real quick.

2806
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,240
Let's just fuck him up.

2807
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,380
Yeah, that's right.

2808
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:55,100
Kill Pippin.

2809
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,560
Just fuck Pippin in particular.

2810
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:02,600
Who cares?

2811
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:04,040
Surround him!

2812
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:07,380
Yeah!

2813
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:13,400
We did it!

2814
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:14,860
The good end!

2815
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:19,930
Yeah!

2816
01:58:23,290 --> 01:58:24,890
The good end!

2817
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:26,310
Let's go!

2818
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:28,730
What?!

2819
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:31,390
We killed all your friends.

2820
01:58:34,030 --> 01:58:35,590
That's fine.

2821
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:37,930
What the fuck is Frodo gonna do?

2822
01:58:39,110 --> 01:58:41,350
We killed all his friends anyway.

2823
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:43,910
Bye Sam!

2824
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:44,930
That's right.

2825
01:58:45,290 --> 01:58:49,070
Sam and Frodo had to watch us kill Gimli and...

2826
01:58:49,070 --> 01:58:54,310
Gimli, Aragorn, Merry, Pippin, Legolas and the rest.

2827
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:58,210
We won the war!

2828
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:05,330
Yeah, we conquered it.

2829
01:59:10,290 --> 01:59:11,890
Sam can still...

2830
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:13,370
The fellowship is broken!

2831
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:14,070
Yay!

2832
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:20,280
I killed the king.

2833
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:21,380
I'm the king now.

2834
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:25,040
Alright, what's next?

2835
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:28,120
I don't wanna deal with the trees, guys.

2836
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:34,300
Guys, I don't know if I wanna deal with the trees, guys.

2837
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:43,480
Guys, I think the one thing I'm afraid of at the moment...

2838
01:59:44,060 --> 01:59:45,540
I'm... oh man.

2839
01:59:45,900 --> 01:59:47,380
Oh man, I don't know.

2840
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:48,420
They can keep the trees.

2841
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:50,100
I'll just... I'll surround them.

2842
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:52,000
They can keep the trees.

2843
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:55,140
I'll take the rest of the territory around me.

2844
01:59:56,240 --> 02:00:00,120
After that one time, yeah, no, I've learned my lesson, guys.

2845
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:01,720
I've learned my lesson.

2846
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:06,980
No, no, of course not.

2847
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:07,760
Of course not.

2848
02:00:08,220 --> 02:00:09,960
The bad guys are the people who lose.

2849
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:12,160
If we win, we're not the bad guys.

2850
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,700
Alright, nice.

2851
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:19,620
Okay, I assume they'll be like here.

2852
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,840
So... oh shit, what?

2853
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:23,880
This is where the army is?

2854
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:29,220
I'll build these and then I'll build the hut here.

2855
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:30,820
Ooh.

2856
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:33,100
I can upgrade.

2857
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:35,520
Do I want the Eye of Sauron?

2858
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:37,960
Stealth, leadership bonus, and fear.

2859
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:38,660
Plus 50.

2860
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:39,720
Ooh, we should get that.

2861
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:41,680
Or plus 3,000.

2862
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:42,140
Ooh!

2863
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:44,160
I wanna get that.

2864
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:46,240
I want the resource upgrades.

2865
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:49,640
Let's see.

2866
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:51,420
I feel like I have to prepare.

2867
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:56,980
Uh...

2868
02:00:56,980 --> 02:01:00,480
Ooh, I wanna... I wanna...

2869
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:00,720
Where?

2870
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:01,980
Already?!

2871
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:02,960
I just got here!

2872
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:05,100
What the fuck?!

2873
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,800
I literally just got here.

2874
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:09,860
You know what?

2875
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:10,940
I can 1v1 these.

2876
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,380
I can 1v1 this.

2877
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,880
I literally just got here.

2878
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:16,700
Like, excuse me?

2879
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:18,420
Like, chill, please?

2880
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:23,020
Yeah, I can 1v1 the wards.

2881
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:24,420
He can not 1v1 that.

2882
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:25,940
He can not 1v1 that.

2883
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:27,580
He can not 1v1 that.

2884
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,380
He can not.

2885
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:29,680
He can not.

2886
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:33,500
Okay, this is like not fair.

2887
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:36,960
This is...

2888
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,820
This is not fair.

2889
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:40,120
Like, excuse me?

2890
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:43,520
I just started the game!

2891
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:45,420
I... what?!

2892
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,140
How?

2893
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:50,820
What?!

2894
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:52,220
I just started!

2895
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:55,840
He just surfed and R.

2896
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,360
How do I build faster?

2897
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:00,620
How do I build faster?!

2898
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:01,800
That's not fair!

2899
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,420
How the fuck do I build faster?!

2900
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:09,500
This is... this is bullshit.

2901
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:11,000
This is actually bullshit.

2902
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,720
This is... this is bullshit.

2903
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:17,120
How do I...

2904
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:20,300
This is... this is actually fucked up.

2905
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:21,920
This is so fucked up.

2906
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:24,420
Like, I just started!

2907
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:26,900
Oh my god!

2908
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,280
I just started it!

2909
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:35,980
No!

2910
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:38,760
My camp!

2911
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:41,880
What do I do?!

2912
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,020
I don't have any...

2913
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:51,750
What?!

2914
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:53,730
What the fuck?!

2915
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:55,650
Just let me die!

2916
02:02:56,530 --> 02:02:59,110
Just let me die!

2917
02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:03,510
And then he builds a farm in front of me!

2918
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:05,470
That's so fucked!

2919
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:11,010
That's so... stop being a crybaby!

2920
02:03:13,550 --> 02:03:21,010
I literally just started and then they send an... what?!

2921
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:25,890
I don't... what the fuck?!

2922
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:27,710
I just started!

2923
02:03:29,090 --> 02:03:35,750
Build a farm... like, there was no way for me to play faster!

2924
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:40,810
Every skill issue.

2925
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:42,170
Gordon, thank you.

2926
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:44,050
Superchat, thank you.

2927
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:44,190
Thank you.

2928
02:03:46,150 --> 02:03:55,130
I literally started the game up, built my house, and then, like, an entire army showed up!

2929
02:03:55,650 --> 02:03:58,910
I don't understand how I could have played that better!

2930
02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:00,590
I don't understand!

2931
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:03,490
I legitimately don't understand!

2932
02:04:03,490 --> 02:04:07,530
I just started the game!

2933
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:13,070
That was crazy!

2934
02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:20,330
I had, like, no moment to, like... I had no moment of rest.

2935
02:04:22,230 --> 02:04:23,570
Oh my god!

2936
02:04:24,730 --> 02:04:25,910
They showed up!

2937
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:26,250
They're here!

2938
02:04:26,430 --> 02:04:26,850
They're here!

2939
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:29,890
They're here!

2940
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:30,970
Okay.

2941
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:32,170
Okay.

2942
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:35,250
Things are okay for now.

2943
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:37,290
It's just one horse.

2944
02:04:37,850 --> 02:04:39,370
It's just one horse for now.

2945
02:04:39,710 --> 02:04:40,850
Oh, there they come!

2946
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:43,170
Here they come!

2947
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:47,870
I don't trust.

2948
02:04:48,130 --> 02:04:49,190
I don't trust them.

2949
02:04:49,670 --> 02:04:52,050
I need more reinforcements.

2950
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:53,770
I don't trust them.

2951
02:04:55,110 --> 02:04:56,590
Oh my god!

2952
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:00,610
Oh my god!

2953
02:05:00,690 --> 02:05:00,770
Oh my god!

2954
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:02,070
I hope things are okay!

2955
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:04,870
I'm staying here!

2956
02:05:06,210 --> 02:05:09,630
Oh, I don't have much, much people left, though.

2957
02:05:10,130 --> 02:05:11,710
I don't have enough.

2958
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:13,730
Oh my god, I survived the first attack!

2959
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:16,890
Oh my god.

2960
02:05:18,430 --> 02:05:21,310
Oh my god, there's more!

2961
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:21,950
There's more!

2962
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:26,170
Oh, you stayed back.

2963
02:05:26,470 --> 02:05:28,830
You're still alive.

2964
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:30,350
They keep going.

2965
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:32,810
Okay.

2966
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:34,230
Okay.

2967
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:36,290
I need more money.

2968
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:39,970
Oh, he's coming in!

2969
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:45,770
Oh, I don't have...

2970
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:48,870
Oh, I don't have much!

2971
02:05:49,230 --> 02:05:50,030
Please!

2972
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:52,950
Oh, I'm surviving!

2973
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:58,310
I'm surviving right now.

2974
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:02,710
Oh, I'm surviving!

2975
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:06,850
It's okay.

2976
02:06:07,370 --> 02:06:07,970
It's okay.

2977
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:09,950
It's okay.

2978
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:10,910
It's not okay.

2979
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:14,930
I'm building as fast as I can!

2980
02:06:17,590 --> 02:06:19,250
Jesus Christ!

2981
02:06:21,310 --> 02:06:21,810
It's okay.

2982
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:32,180
There's more horses, guys!

2983
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:34,240
There's more!

2984
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:41,860
Oh my god, there's more horses.

2985
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:45,700
Oh my god!

2986
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:49,520
Okay.

2987
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:51,060
Okay, slowly.

2988
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:52,500
It's fine.

2989
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:53,760
Everything is okay.

2990
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:56,220
It's not okay, but everything is okay.

2991
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:59,640
I don't feel okay right now, but it's okay.

2992
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:01,000
Everything is okay.

2993
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,960
And there's... there's so much!

2994
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:04,020
There's so many!

2995
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,220
There's so many!

2996
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:06,540
There's so many!

2997
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:10,840
Oh, you're crazy!

2998
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:12,300
You're fucking crazy!

2999
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:13,400
Go back!

3000
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:14,520
Go back!

3001
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,520
Go back!

3002
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:20,320
Oh, I don't have a lot of money.

3003
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:22,460
I don't have a lot!

3004
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:24,060
Please, I have so little!

3005
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:25,640
I have so little!

3006
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:28,700
Oh my god!

3007
02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:30,500
Okay.

3008
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:31,860
Okay, just do this.

3009
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:34,840
Um.

3010
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:36,180
Um.

3011
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:39,080
That's fine.

3012
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:40,480
We'll put more arrows.

3013
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:46,040
Just... mission survive!

3014
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:47,320
Just survive!

3015
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:49,280
I almost have reinforcements!

3016
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:51,860
Oh, fuck!

3017
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:52,220
Okay.

3018
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:53,720
Survive!

3019
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:55,120
Survive!

3020
02:07:55,340 --> 02:07:55,840
Survive!

3021
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:56,620
Survive!

3022
02:07:59,220 --> 02:08:00,240
You're the villain!

3023
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:03,060
Why do you need money?

3024
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:05,840
Please, have mercy on me!

3025
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,680
Have... have mercy, please!

3026
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:15,320
It's for the enemy reinforcements!

3027
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,520
God, I'm so fucked!

3028
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:20,860
I'm so fucking... I'm so fucking... I'm so...

3029
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:22,380
Oh, fuck!

3030
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:25,560
What do you mean they're for the enemy reinforcements?

3031
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:27,120
I need them more!

3032
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,820
I need them more!

3033
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:33,600
I'm... What do you mean?

3034
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:35,500
I... Oh!

3035
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:37,520
Jesus!

3036
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:41,760
I... I need them so much more!

3037
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,520
No, my arrows!

3038
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:46,480
My arrows!

3039
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:48,680
Somebody send help!

3040
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:52,020
Oh, no!

3041
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:54,240
Oh, no!

3042
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:55,820
I'm cutting trees down!

3043
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:59,260
I'm fucking increasing the resources!

3044
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:02,640
I'm... I'm sending them out!

3045
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:05,600
Oh, my God!

3046
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,660
Have

3047
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:11,120
mercy!

3048
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:14,120
Have mercy on me!

3049
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:19,160
Holy fuck!

3050
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:25,110
Oh, thank God!

3051
02:09:26,030 --> 02:09:27,470
No mercy!

3052
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:29,070
Please!

3053
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:30,350
Please!

3054
02:09:33,730 --> 02:09:34,430
Okay.

3055
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:36,130
Okay.

3056
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:38,270
Okay.

3057
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:40,490
More arrows!

3058
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:43,150
More arrows!

3059
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:47,480
Oh, fuck!

3060
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:48,960
Oh, no!

3061
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,500
More pikemen!

3062
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Oh, fuck!

3063
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:54,800
Not the reinforcements!

3064
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:57,040
Oh, shit!

3065
02:10:01,020 --> 02:10:03,420
Oh, no!

3066
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:05,000
Oh, no!

3067
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:07,000
Oh, no!

3068
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,580
Oh, no!

3069
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:11,100
Oh, fuck!

3070
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:11,980
No!

3071
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:13,340
Oh, shit!

3072
02:10:15,980 --> 02:10:17,520
I'm trying!

3073
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,180
They're coming!

3074
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:23,120
Oh, no!

3075
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,020
Oh, no!

3076
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:26,060
They're all here!

3077
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:28,060
I fought!

3078
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:31,800
These are my last remaining army!

3079
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:32,840
No!

3080
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:34,280
Not the horses!

3081
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:35,500
Please!

3082
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,080
Not the horses!

3083
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:40,400
Please!

3084
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,860
Oh, goodbye!

3085
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,220
Goodbye!

3086
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:48,080
Goodbye!

3087
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:49,760
Not the horses!

3088
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:52,860
Please, just give me the pikemen!

3089
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:54,120
Wait!

3090
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:58,460
If I keep building these, it'll be fine!

3091
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:00,420
I think I can live!

3092
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,980
I just gotta keep building these!

3093
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:06,280
Not the horses!

3094
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:08,440
Anything but the pikemen!

3095
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:09,640
Pikemen!

3096
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:10,860
Reinforcements!

3097
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:13,380
Okay.

3098
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:14,080
Okay.

3099
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:14,940
Things are fine.

3100
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:16,620
Oh, my God!

3101
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:17,720
Oh, my God!

3102
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:18,970
We just keep...

3103
02:11:20,990 --> 02:11:22,390
Just keep building these!

3104
02:11:22,730 --> 02:11:25,670
Just keep building these and everything will be fine!

3105
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:28,270
I just keep... Oh, my God!

3106
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:30,350
Everything will be fine!

3107
02:11:30,850 --> 02:11:31,710
Oh, my God!

3108
02:11:31,770 --> 02:11:32,650
My poor pikemen!

3109
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:36,750
Okay.

3110
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:37,930
Alright.

3111
02:11:38,170 --> 02:11:38,650
I lived.

3112
02:11:39,210 --> 02:11:40,110
I fucking lived.

3113
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:41,350
What even...

3114
02:11:41,350 --> 02:11:43,610
Oh, destroy all the good forces!

3115
02:11:43,870 --> 02:11:44,510
Oh, my God!

3116
02:11:44,570 --> 02:11:44,810
Please!

3117
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:46,210
I need to survive first!

3118
02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:49,170
My first mission is to fucking survive!

3119
02:11:51,150 --> 02:11:52,150
Okay.

3120
02:11:53,190 --> 02:11:54,430
It's fine.

3121
02:11:55,410 --> 02:11:55,930
It's fine.

3122
02:11:56,990 --> 02:11:57,750
We go in.

3123
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:02,470
Oh, shit!

3124
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:05,830
Okay.

3125
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:07,510
We stabilized.

3126
02:12:08,490 --> 02:12:12,930
Guys, I don't know how we did it, but we stabilized.

3127
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:17,030
I don't know how we did it, guys.

3128
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:21,850
Those are still... Oh, my God!

3129
02:12:21,970 --> 02:12:24,490
Oh, my God!

3130
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:24,830
Okay.

3131
02:12:25,790 --> 02:12:26,170
Okay.

3132
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:28,410
I'm gonna take this farm.

3133
02:12:29,830 --> 02:12:32,390
I believe... Oh, fuck!

3134
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:34,130
They're building an army right now.

3135
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:38,980
We'll take this farm!

3136
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:42,580
We're gonna take this farm!

3137
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:45,980
We're gonna... Oh, come on!

3138
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:49,620
How are they beating my pikemen?

3139
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:53,380
Oh, shit!

3140
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:55,100
Oh, fuck!

3141
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:55,420
Okay.

3142
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:57,080
That's okay.

3143
02:12:58,120 --> 02:12:59,200
That's okay.

3144
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:02,300
I fucking... That is not okay.

3145
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:04,500
They just destroyed my pikemen.

3146
02:13:04,980 --> 02:13:06,140
Oh, no!

3147
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:07,100
Oh, no!

3148
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:10,920
Oh, my God!

3149
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:13,880
Oh, this is so rough.

3150
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:16,100
This is so fucking rough.

3151
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:18,700
How did my pikemen die?

3152
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:21,020
Oh, my God!

3153
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:23,800
How did they die?

3154
02:13:24,180 --> 02:13:26,660
How did they fucking die?!

3155
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:28,280
Okay.

3156
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:29,320
Okay.

3157
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:30,780
We built another siege.

3158
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:32,400
This is the only way.

3159
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:35,280
We just need to keep defending.

3160
02:13:38,330 --> 02:13:40,690
Guys, I can't upgrade.

3161
02:13:40,910 --> 02:13:43,770
I'm just trying to survive.

3162
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:45,650
You don't understand.

3163
02:13:48,210 --> 02:13:50,570
You don't understand.

3164
02:13:51,150 --> 02:13:53,810
My only mission is to live.

3165
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:57,270
I just... Oh, my God!

3166
02:13:58,690 --> 02:13:59,090
Okay.

3167
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:00,590
Okay.

3168
02:14:01,230 --> 02:14:01,990
Things are okay.

3169
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:04,490
Now we have like... Now we have extra.

3170
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:07,210
Okay.

3171
02:14:07,650 --> 02:14:09,190
Now I can take this farm.

3172
02:14:11,050 --> 02:14:11,570
Wait.

3173
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:12,390
What the fuck?

3174
02:14:12,510 --> 02:14:13,410
Oh, my God!

3175
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:15,650
Why are you just letting them shoot you?!

3176
02:14:19,190 --> 02:14:19,710
Okay.

3177
02:14:19,710 --> 02:14:20,490
That's fine.

3178
02:14:22,050 --> 02:14:22,870
That's fine.

3179
02:14:24,130 --> 02:14:25,990
We don't let them just shoot us, you know?

3180
02:14:27,430 --> 02:14:29,670
We don't... We don't just let them... Guys.

3181
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:30,130
Guys.

3182
02:14:30,350 --> 02:14:30,830
Guys.

3183
02:14:32,050 --> 02:14:32,570
Guys.

3184
02:14:32,570 --> 02:14:33,530
Guys.

3185
02:14:34,370 --> 02:14:34,910
Guys.

3186
02:14:35,110 --> 02:14:37,730
Stop just letting them shoot you like that.

3187
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:38,870
Please.

3188
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:42,110
Please.

3189
02:14:42,190 --> 02:14:42,990
That's all I ask.

3190
02:14:43,810 --> 02:14:44,290
How?

3191
02:14:44,570 --> 02:14:44,970
How?

3192
02:14:45,150 --> 02:14:45,410
Why?

3193
02:14:47,590 --> 02:14:48,510
I can't.

3194
02:14:49,210 --> 02:14:49,850
I can't.

3195
02:14:49,930 --> 02:14:52,090
I'm just... Just kill these villagers.

3196
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:53,270
I can't.

3197
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:54,990
I'm gonna use this just for this farm.

3198
02:14:55,450 --> 02:14:56,390
Is this overkill?

3199
02:14:56,530 --> 02:14:56,870
Maybe.

3200
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:58,370
But like, you don't understand.

3201
02:14:58,510 --> 02:14:59,150
I'm so done.

3202
02:15:02,690 --> 02:15:04,330
You don't understand.

3203
02:15:04,890 --> 02:15:08,130
I'm... I'm so done with this.

3204
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:13,170
Just... I need this to be over.

3205
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:16,470
Just kill them.

3206
02:15:16,930 --> 02:15:17,670
Just kill them.

3207
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:18,470
You can chill.

3208
02:15:19,530 --> 02:15:20,430
You can chill.

3209
02:15:21,070 --> 02:15:21,470
Okay.

3210
02:15:22,210 --> 02:15:24,530
So like, we'll be fine now.

3211
02:15:24,710 --> 02:15:27,070
This should be like... This is workable.

3212
02:15:27,230 --> 02:15:28,530
We can work with this.

3213
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:31,310
We can work with this.

3214
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:34,070
We can definitely work with this.

3215
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:37,390
There we go.

3216
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:39,630
We finally got our... We got what we wanted.

3217
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:40,170
Guys.

3218
02:15:40,630 --> 02:15:44,190
Guys, this is... Guys, we salvaged this.

3219
02:15:44,530 --> 02:15:46,270
We actually... Guys.

3220
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:48,990
We salvaged it.

3221
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:50,830
Guys, we did it.

3222
02:15:51,290 --> 02:15:53,130
We did it.

3223
02:15:54,390 --> 02:15:56,390
We fucking did it.

3224
02:15:56,750 --> 02:15:58,310
I'm so proud of us.

3225
02:15:58,550 --> 02:16:01,250
I'm so proud of us.

3226
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:04,090
We actually lived.

3227
02:16:05,090 --> 02:16:06,330
Oh my god.

3228
02:16:06,710 --> 02:16:07,930
Oh my god.

3229
02:16:07,930 --> 02:16:08,070
We did it.

3230
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:12,490
The dream is alive.

3231
02:16:13,610 --> 02:16:14,230
Everyone.

3232
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:16,870
The dream is alive.

3233
02:16:18,550 --> 02:16:20,450
It's alive.

3234
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:22,530
Get the horses.

3235
02:16:24,550 --> 02:16:26,790
We are living the dream.

3236
02:16:27,850 --> 02:16:29,290
Get the horses.

3237
02:16:30,390 --> 02:16:32,170
Get the people.

3238
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:37,380
We're doing it.

3239
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:40,760
Get them.

3240
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:43,700
Okay.

3241
02:16:43,940 --> 02:16:45,160
Well, you got stuck.

3242
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:48,500
Okay, I'm gonna kill these guys in particular.

3243
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:49,340
Alright.

3244
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:50,560
It's fine.

3245
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:50,940
It's fine.

3246
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:53,740
The dream is absolutely alive right now.

3247
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,180
Oh my god.

3248
02:16:58,060 --> 02:16:59,480
We actually did it.

3249
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:07,240
We're actually... Okay, now we need to get rid of this so I can actually build a siege weapon.

3250
02:17:09,580 --> 02:17:13,760
So I can afford... I can afford a siege weapon.

3251
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,300
That's right.

3252
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:18,080
It's my turn.

3253
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:22,640
That's fucking... Oh shit.

3254
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:23,880
You go back home though.

3255
02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:25,560
You go back home.

3256
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:29,280
That's fucking right.

3257
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:32,620
It's my turn.

3258
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:34,000
Alright, now I just need a siege.

3259
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:36,060
Alright.

3260
02:17:36,060 --> 02:17:37,580
Let's get that batarang.

3261
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:39,980
And then get that thing here.

3262
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:42,000
Alright, now I'm ready.

3263
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:44,600
I'm ready.

3264
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:45,860
No, these are bait.

3265
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:46,620
These are bait.

3266
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:47,860
Oh my god.

3267
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,880
Where did all these horses come from?

3268
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:53,220
Where did all these horses come from?

3269
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:54,720
But it's okay.

3270
02:17:57,440 --> 02:17:58,300
It's okay.

3271
02:17:58,560 --> 02:18:00,200
I'm ready for real now.

3272
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:01,300
That was bait.

3273
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:03,040
That was me mowing them down.

3274
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:04,920
They're so cooked.

3275
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:07,200
I have everything I need.

3276
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:11,140
I'm so ready now.

3277
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:13,480
This is fine.

3278
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:18,320
I'll put two batarangs just in case because I don't believe myself.

3279
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:19,840
Alright, let's go.

3280
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:21,660
Let's go.

3281
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:23,780
Where's the other guy?

3282
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:26,240
Alright, go help him.

3283
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,340
What the fuck?

3284
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:30,520
What do you mean there's extra horses?

3285
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:32,540
Let's go.

3286
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:35,700
This is fine.

3287
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:37,440
And then we'll have extra.

3288
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:40,100
And then I'm gonna cut trees too.

3289
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:44,660
And then we're gonna get rid of these guys as well.

3290
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:46,860
That's right.

3291
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:48,320
And then we're gonna get rid of these guys.

3292
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:51,180
And then.

3293
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:53,500
And then.

3294
02:18:54,840 --> 02:18:56,100
And then we go up.

3295
02:18:57,860 --> 02:19:00,020
How are they making so many people?

3296
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:03,300
Okay.

3297
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:04,540
Alright.

3298
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:06,700
We have our two batarang rams.

3299
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:07,860
We're gonna slowly head up.

3300
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:09,640
Jesus Christ.

3301
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,020
The forest alive.

3302
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:15,220
It's time.

3303
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:19,260
It's time.

3304
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:22,080
Where's my batarang?

3305
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:22,900
Get over here.

3306
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:26,880
Get over here.

3307
02:19:32,890 --> 02:19:33,830
Alright.

3308
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:35,250
I'm ready.

3309
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:38,590
Get over here.

3310
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:40,430
Oh shit, not the horses.

3311
02:19:40,970 --> 02:19:41,810
Oh shit.

3312
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:42,130
Okay.

3313
02:19:42,830 --> 02:19:44,330
Maybe I'm not ready.

3314
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:46,670
Oh no.

3315
02:19:46,890 --> 02:19:47,410
It's okay.

3316
02:19:47,430 --> 02:19:48,150
They're all distracted.

3317
02:19:49,170 --> 02:19:51,030
They're all distracted, guys.

3318
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:53,850
They're all so distracted, everyone.

3319
02:19:54,310 --> 02:19:55,310
That's right.

3320
02:19:58,490 --> 02:19:59,710
I'm ready.

3321
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:11,200
I'm so ready.

3322
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:13,360
Get over here.

3323
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:15,380
Oh, everybody's dead.

3324
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:16,880
Okay, everybody's dying.

3325
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:18,780
Okay, maybe I'm not as ready.

3326
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:19,780
You go over here.

3327
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:23,320
You go over here.

3328
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:25,260
Um, they're all dead.

3329
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:26,000
I just realized.

3330
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:26,560
Wait, wait, wait.

3331
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:27,260
I have a plan.

3332
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:29,980
I have a plan.

3333
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:31,380
Watch this.

3334
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:38,400
You go in there and then he leaves.

3335
02:20:38,940 --> 02:20:40,180
Oh shit.

3336
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,380
Oh shit.

3337
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:42,340
Oh shit.

3338
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:46,780
That's fine.

3339
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:48,920
That's fine.

3340
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:50,940
Oh my god.

3341
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:52,180
Oh my god.

3342
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:52,740
Oh.

3343
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:55,320
Oh, where did this army come from?

3344
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:58,920
Where the fuck did they come from?

3345
02:21:03,230 --> 02:21:03,830
Wait.

3346
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:05,110
Oh wait.

3347
02:21:05,390 --> 02:21:12,600
They just showed up out of nowhere.

3348
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:15,440
Where the fuck did they come from?

3349
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:18,140
Okay, I was not expecting that.

3350
02:21:19,580 --> 02:21:22,620
They like, they like showed up out of nowhere.

3351
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:24,220
How was I supposed to know?

3352
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:26,640
How the fuck?

3353
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:28,580
Okay, we need upgrade.

3354
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:32,280
Okay, now we can destroy this and then get upgrades.

3355
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:34,100
Now we can actually get upgrades.

3356
02:21:34,300 --> 02:21:34,600
Okay.

3357
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:35,460
Okay.

3358
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:38,320
Things will be okay, guys.

3359
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:39,680
Things will be okay.

3360
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:42,760
Everyone, just start believing.

3361
02:21:43,180 --> 02:21:44,120
Things will be fine.

3362
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:46,820
You have alerted the Horde.

3363
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:49,300
Gordon, thank you for the super chat.

3364
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,260
What?

3365
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:55,280
Okay, things will be fine.

3366
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:56,740
We just gotta rebuild the army.

3367
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:02,060
Okay, alright, now we rebuild the army and you actually get upgrades, guys.

3368
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:03,760
Now we upgrade.

3369
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:07,200
Okay, don't stop believing.

3370
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:08,680
We're rich now.

3371
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:09,800
We're so rich.

3372
02:22:10,180 --> 02:22:11,520
Don't stop believing.

3373
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,620
We're so healthy.

3374
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:17,060
We're so healthy.

3375
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:19,760
We will get all the horses.

3376
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:21,780
We will get back the horses, guys.

3377
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:24,600
Don't worry.

3378
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:28,420
We will have the horses.

3379
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:32,000
Okay, let's all like, let's all calm down, everyone.

3380
02:22:32,680 --> 02:22:34,540
Let's all calm down.

3381
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:36,260
Oh my god.

3382
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:37,660
Okay.

3383
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:39,640
See ya.

3384
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:43,800
Alright, I need to make sure...

3385
02:22:44,660 --> 02:22:46,260
Okay, we gotta get this upgraded.

3386
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:48,960
Alright, see guys, look.

3387
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:49,880
It's all fine.

3388
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:51,660
We're getting the upgrades.

3389
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,040
And then we have armor now.

3390
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:56,980
Guys, we're so healthy.

3391
02:22:57,740 --> 02:22:59,500
We have armor now.

3392
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:01,800
Nothing can kill us now.

3393
02:23:03,140 --> 02:23:05,760
We should be able to upgrade our, like, arrow shit, too.

3394
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:06,300
Look at that.

3395
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:07,260
Look at that.

3396
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:09,660
Nothing can kill.

3397
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:11,980
Now we have all the upgrades.

3398
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:14,300
Except for the fire arrow.

3399
02:23:14,660 --> 02:23:17,920
Except for the fire arrow, but we almost have all the upgrades.

3400
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:20,100
Okay.

3401
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:22,140
Integrate together.

3402
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:23,280
You're now best friends.

3403
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:25,300
Integrate together.

3404
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:26,320
You're now best friends.

3405
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:29,420
Alright, I need you guys to be best friends, guys.

3406
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:31,240
Oh, I have no money.

3407
02:23:31,380 --> 02:23:33,020
Okay, this is, oh, that's awkward.

3408
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,140
That's awkward.

3409
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:35,900
I did a lot of upgrades.

3410
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:36,680
It's okay.

3411
02:23:37,300 --> 02:23:38,520
I have this.

3412
02:23:40,520 --> 02:23:41,420
There we go.

3413
02:23:41,860 --> 02:23:42,480
There we go.

3414
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,620
And then I can do this.

3415
02:23:44,440 --> 02:23:46,140
Get rid of all the trees.

3416
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:46,920
There we go.

3417
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:47,840
Now I have all the money.

3418
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:50,680
Okay.

3419
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:51,120
Nice.

3420
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:55,300
There we go.

3421
02:23:56,660 --> 02:23:57,260
There we go.

3422
02:23:57,340 --> 02:23:58,360
Oh, we're broke again.

3423
02:23:58,460 --> 02:23:59,160
But that's fine.

3424
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:00,080
That's fine.

3425
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:03,180
We have the army.

3426
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:05,600
We have the army, guys.

3427
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:08,000
Oh, back out, because you guys are...

3428
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,920
Back out, because you guys don't know what rage is.

3429
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:12,000
Back out.

3430
02:24:13,580 --> 02:24:14,700
Alright, nice.

3431
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:17,800
With buddy, we're so healthy.

3432
02:24:18,740 --> 02:24:19,380
Okay.

3433
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,440
And then...

3434
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:22,620
Grab the armor.

3435
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:25,800
We have everything, right?

3436
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:27,780
Alright.

3437
02:24:28,820 --> 02:24:29,840
Look at that.

3438
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:32,140
This is it.

3439
02:24:32,580 --> 02:24:33,340
This is the run.

3440
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:36,320
Don't... This is the run.

3441
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:39,740
This is... Oh my god, that dog.

3442
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:42,400
No, no, no, no!

3443
02:24:48,050 --> 02:24:48,430
No!

3444
02:24:49,370 --> 02:24:50,910
Not the horses!

3445
02:24:51,970 --> 02:24:53,750
Anything but the horses.

3446
02:24:54,830 --> 02:24:55,210
No!

3447
02:24:56,530 --> 02:24:58,350
Oh my god.

3448
02:24:59,310 --> 02:24:59,830
Why?

3449
02:25:00,190 --> 02:25:01,630
I was so ready.

3450
02:25:02,270 --> 02:25:04,050
I was so ready.

3451
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:06,350
Why?

3452
02:25:09,830 --> 02:25:12,150
We were all so ready.

3453
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:15,570
It's okay.

3454
02:25:17,090 --> 02:25:17,630
It's okay.

3455
02:25:17,690 --> 02:25:18,570
Everything is fine.

3456
02:25:19,070 --> 02:25:21,810
My people... My people are doing okay.

3457
02:25:22,750 --> 02:25:24,270
I believe in my people.

3458
02:25:25,270 --> 02:25:26,270
This is it.

3459
02:25:26,830 --> 02:25:27,530
Did they rebuild?

3460
02:25:28,070 --> 02:25:30,610
They rebuilt their fucking...

3461
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:35,130
That should be illegal.

3462
02:25:36,190 --> 02:25:38,190
That... Oh my god.

3463
02:25:38,370 --> 02:25:42,470
I didn't realize they can rebuild.

3464
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:44,790
I didn't...

3465
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:46,490
It's okay.

3466
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:47,330
It's okay.

3467
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:47,990
It's okay.

3468
02:25:48,090 --> 02:25:48,430
It's okay.

3469
02:25:48,830 --> 02:25:50,490
All my men are okay.

3470
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:52,230
They can rebuild too.

3471
02:25:52,850 --> 02:25:54,170
They can also rebuild.

3472
02:25:56,690 --> 02:25:58,550
I don't have horses!

3473
02:25:58,550 --> 02:26:00,710
I don't have horses!

3474
02:26:01,550 --> 02:26:02,610
It's okay.

3475
02:26:03,010 --> 02:26:04,650
I can also rebuild.

3476
02:26:05,910 --> 02:26:07,930
I... It's fine.

3477
02:26:08,990 --> 02:26:10,850
I can fix this.

3478
02:26:11,930 --> 02:26:13,510
We're so fine.

3479
02:26:14,370 --> 02:26:14,970
Alright.

3480
02:26:15,890 --> 02:26:17,750
This is the final countdown.

3481
02:26:19,330 --> 02:26:20,070
Oh no.

3482
02:26:20,390 --> 02:26:20,790
Oh no.

3483
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:21,710
Get out of here.

3484
02:26:21,950 --> 02:26:23,590
I don't trust you guys.

3485
02:26:23,710 --> 02:26:25,390
You guys are just gonna die.

3486
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:26,750
Alright.

3487
02:26:28,270 --> 02:26:31,030
The RTS and R sets for rebuild.

3488
02:26:31,510 --> 02:26:31,950
It's okay.

3489
02:26:32,370 --> 02:26:33,610
We can also rebuild.

3490
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:36,350
We can all rebuild, guys.

3491
02:26:36,650 --> 02:26:37,250
Alright.

3492
02:26:37,570 --> 02:26:38,110
Here we go.

3493
02:26:38,690 --> 02:26:40,410
We just gotta wait for our...

3494
02:26:40,410 --> 02:26:41,270
Oh my god.

3495
02:26:41,370 --> 02:26:42,710
Are you fucking kidding me?

3496
02:26:43,450 --> 02:26:44,270
Oh my god.

3497
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:44,710
I forgot.

3498
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:47,290
I don't have command points.

3499
02:26:47,890 --> 02:26:49,150
Oh my god.

3500
02:26:49,230 --> 02:26:49,430
Alright.

3501
02:26:49,550 --> 02:26:50,810
One of you guys have to die.

3502
02:26:50,810 --> 02:26:51,850
Goodbye.

3503
02:26:51,850 --> 02:26:53,150
Oh fuck!

3504
02:26:53,230 --> 02:26:53,530
Okay.

3505
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:55,710
What do we not need?

3506
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:57,430
Fuck!

3507
02:26:59,310 --> 02:26:59,910
Okay.

3508
02:27:00,010 --> 02:27:01,290
We're sending you to your deaths.

3509
02:27:01,850 --> 02:27:02,450
Goodbye.

3510
02:27:04,230 --> 02:27:04,830
Goodbye.

3511
02:27:07,250 --> 02:27:08,750
I need... Goodbye.

3512
02:27:09,570 --> 02:27:11,650
You're gonna have to die to this so I can get this.

3513
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:15,570
Goodbye.

3514
02:27:15,890 --> 02:27:17,050
Oh seven.

3515
02:27:17,830 --> 02:27:18,950
Oh seven.

3516
02:27:19,130 --> 02:27:23,670
Oh my god.

3517
02:27:24,510 --> 02:27:25,730
Oh seven.

3518
02:27:27,210 --> 02:27:27,790
Goodbye.

3519
02:27:29,070 --> 02:27:31,710
Your sacrifice was not in vain.

3520
02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:35,530
I swear to god.

3521
02:27:36,290 --> 02:27:39,290
Your sacrifice was not in vain.

3522
02:27:41,650 --> 02:27:44,570
It was for a good cause.

3523
02:27:46,350 --> 02:27:48,090
Do not worry.

3524
02:27:49,530 --> 02:27:50,570
I swear to god.

3525
02:27:50,650 --> 02:27:54,270
If those horses ran in, I swear to fucking god.

3526
02:27:56,050 --> 02:27:56,570
Okay.

3527
02:27:57,610 --> 02:27:57,970
Alright.

3528
02:27:58,090 --> 02:27:58,610
It's time.

3529
02:27:59,730 --> 02:28:00,030
Okay.

3530
02:28:00,090 --> 02:28:01,010
It's time for real.

3531
02:28:02,830 --> 02:28:03,550
It's okay.

3532
02:28:03,730 --> 02:28:04,330
For real.

3533
02:28:04,490 --> 02:28:05,170
It's time.

3534
02:28:06,290 --> 02:28:07,870
It's time for real.

3535
02:28:08,910 --> 02:28:10,170
It's for real.

3536
02:28:10,390 --> 02:28:11,190
Real Zs.

3537
02:28:11,530 --> 02:28:13,510
We're not fucking around no more.

3538
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:18,860
I'm gonna cut these trees down too for good luck.

3539
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:21,640
Alright.

3540
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:22,460
Here we go.

3541
02:28:24,540 --> 02:28:25,800
Get over there.

3542
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:29,400
Get over there.

3543
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:31,420
Where are my two guys?

3544
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:34,920
Okay.

3545
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:36,320
This is fine.

3546
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:40,700
This is fine.

3547
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,060
This is fine.

3548
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:43,440
Alright.

3549
02:28:44,460 --> 02:28:45,100
Alright.

3550
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:45,740
Here we go.

3551
02:28:47,380 --> 02:28:48,300
Get over here.

3552
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:51,320
You gotta break the thing again.

3553
02:28:55,360 --> 02:28:58,160
We need you to break the thing again.

3554
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:00,500
Alright.

3555
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:02,220
This time.

3556
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:04,520
This time.

3557
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:06,480
We can make this work this time.

3558
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:08,000
Alright.

3559
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:09,660
There we go.

3560
02:29:13,150 --> 02:29:14,010
There we go.

3561
02:29:16,610 --> 02:29:17,550
Get them.

3562
02:29:17,650 --> 02:29:18,050
Get them.

3563
02:29:18,250 --> 02:29:18,910
Alright.

3564
02:29:20,310 --> 02:29:20,790
You too.

3565
02:29:21,050 --> 02:29:21,350
You too.

3566
02:29:21,430 --> 02:29:21,830
How?

3567
02:29:22,170 --> 02:29:23,190
Help him.

3568
02:29:24,390 --> 02:29:25,490
Help him.

3569
02:29:27,410 --> 02:29:28,090
Alright.

3570
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:30,610
Alright.

3571
02:29:30,810 --> 02:29:31,210
Here we go.

3572
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:32,490
This is it.

3573
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:35,890
This is it.

3574
02:29:37,910 --> 02:29:39,930
For real this time.

3575
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:46,720
For real.

3576
02:29:47,820 --> 02:29:50,360
We can do this.

3577
02:29:51,220 --> 02:29:51,740
Go.

3578
02:29:52,460 --> 02:29:54,540
Kill everything.

3579
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:57,140
For real.

3580
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:00,040
Just kill everything.

3581
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:04,420
Oh my god.

3582
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:05,720
This time.

3583
02:30:05,980 --> 02:30:06,220
Go.

3584
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:07,220
For real.

3585
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:10,380
Oh my god.

3586
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:11,980
Oh my god.

3587
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:12,640
Thank god.

3588
02:30:13,540 --> 02:30:14,120
Thank god.

3589
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:14,380
No.

3590
02:30:14,460 --> 02:30:15,100
Not the horses.

3591
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,520
Get the horses out of here.

3592
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:19,860
No.

3593
02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:21,080
Not the horses.

3594
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:24,520
No.

3595
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:25,580
Not the horses.

3596
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:30,110
No.

3597
02:30:30,110 --> 02:30:30,310
No.

3598
02:30:34,530 --> 02:30:35,290
No.

3599
02:30:35,290 --> 02:30:37,010
Don't make me do this again.

3600
02:30:37,410 --> 02:30:37,950
No.

3601
02:30:39,970 --> 02:30:40,350
No.

3602
02:30:42,850 --> 02:30:44,270
Oh my god.

3603
02:30:44,390 --> 02:30:45,050
No.

3604
02:30:46,030 --> 02:30:47,330
Oh no.

3605
02:30:47,630 --> 02:30:48,710
They're gonna refill.

3606
02:30:49,730 --> 02:30:50,310
No.

3607
02:30:51,230 --> 02:30:52,550
Please no.

3608
02:30:52,850 --> 02:30:53,930
Do not refill.

3609
02:30:54,070 --> 02:30:54,950
I'm sending them in.

3610
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:56,450
I swear to god.

3611
02:30:57,490 --> 02:30:59,050
I swear to god.

3612
02:30:59,170 --> 02:31:00,270
Do not rebuild.

3613
02:31:00,390 --> 02:31:00,870
I cannot.

3614
02:31:01,170 --> 02:31:03,750
I cannot do this again.

3615
02:31:04,170 --> 02:31:04,570
Please.

3616
02:31:05,130 --> 02:31:06,190
I cannot.

3617
02:31:06,990 --> 02:31:09,250
Do not do this to me.

3618
02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:11,230
I can't.

3619
02:31:11,410 --> 02:31:14,710
I cannot.

3620
02:31:15,630 --> 02:31:16,390
Please.

3621
02:31:17,230 --> 02:31:19,650
Don't do this to me.

3622
02:31:20,170 --> 02:31:20,950
Please.

3623
02:31:23,770 --> 02:31:24,670
No.

3624
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:26,650
No.

3625
02:31:28,410 --> 02:31:30,420
They're gonna refill.

3626
02:31:31,490 --> 02:31:32,030
No.

3627
02:31:33,390 --> 02:31:35,370
Oh my god.

3628
02:31:36,010 --> 02:31:37,890
I can't.

3629
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:42,190
This is gonna be an endless war.

3630
02:31:42,850 --> 02:31:43,990
This war.

3631
02:31:44,510 --> 02:31:47,070
This war is endless.

3632
02:31:47,070 --> 02:31:48,910
I can't.

3633
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:51,830
They're just gonna keep refilling.

3634
02:31:52,450 --> 02:31:53,610
I can't.

3635
02:31:53,890 --> 02:31:55,670
I fucking can't.

3636
02:31:56,030 --> 02:31:57,710
I can't.

3637
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:00,250
There's too many horses.

3638
02:32:01,150 --> 02:32:02,110
Oh my god.

3639
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:04,770
No.

3640
02:32:05,450 --> 02:32:07,610
It's never gonna end.

3641
02:32:09,990 --> 02:32:12,430
I fucking can't.

3642
02:32:12,430 --> 02:32:14,090
I can't guys.

3643
02:32:14,690 --> 02:32:16,510
I can't anymore.

3644
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:20,470
Oh no.

3645
02:32:22,250 --> 02:32:24,150
They're never gonna update.

3646
02:32:24,410 --> 02:32:26,030
They're just gonna keep refilling.

3647
02:32:27,090 --> 02:32:28,610
The horses.

3648
02:32:30,190 --> 02:32:32,330
They're crashing out.

3649
02:32:34,530 --> 02:32:36,490
Oh my god.

3650
02:32:37,210 --> 02:32:38,990
The horses.

3651
02:32:38,990 --> 02:32:41,130
There's too many horses.

3652
02:32:41,630 --> 02:32:42,930
I can't.

3653
02:32:43,210 --> 02:32:45,230
I'm gonna crash out.

3654
02:32:46,590 --> 02:32:50,910
How many times do I have to break the door?

3655
02:32:51,590 --> 02:32:53,810
How many times?

3656
02:32:54,490 --> 02:32:56,010
Oh my god.

3657
02:32:56,830 --> 02:32:59,670
I can't do this.

3658
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:01,070
I can't.

3659
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:07,830
This is what happens in the movies.

3660
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:09,610
No more horses.

3661
02:33:10,910 --> 02:33:13,430
Same time next week.

3662
02:33:13,950 --> 02:33:15,790
Thank you for the super chat.

3663
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:16,450
Thank you.

3664
02:33:20,610 --> 02:33:23,110
There were so many.

3665
02:33:23,690 --> 02:33:25,950
There were so many horses.

3666
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:28,510
Thank you for the super chat.

3667
02:33:28,690 --> 02:33:31,230
There was just so many horses.

3668
02:33:31,730 --> 02:33:33,170
What do I do?

3669
02:33:33,170 --> 02:33:36,670
They just keep making more horses.

3670
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:38,770
I don't understand.

3671
02:33:41,490 --> 02:33:42,390
I can't.

3672
02:33:42,770 --> 02:33:43,930
They're too stuck.

3673
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:44,930
I can't anymore.

3674
02:33:48,910 --> 02:33:49,510
Stop.

3675
02:33:51,850 --> 02:33:52,450
Unlucky.

3676
02:33:52,670 --> 02:33:53,570
Thank you for the super chat.

3677
02:33:53,650 --> 02:33:53,950
Thank you.

3678
02:33:54,050 --> 02:33:58,630
Let's have a moment of silence for those who perished by the name of the horses.

3679
02:33:58,630 --> 02:34:01,650
The famous limit break horse.

3680
02:34:01,850 --> 02:34:04,790
The horses will win this war.

3681
02:34:05,290 --> 02:34:07,350
Oh my god.

3682
02:34:09,070 --> 02:34:13,030
Oh my god.

3683
02:34:13,230 --> 02:34:16,130
I did not expect all the horses.

3684
02:34:16,850 --> 02:34:19,610
They just kept building their army.

3685
02:34:19,890 --> 02:34:21,170
They kept rebuilding.

3686
02:34:21,390 --> 02:34:22,530
I don't understand.

3687
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:27,530
How do these animals keep growing?

3688
02:34:27,530 --> 02:34:30,050
How do they keep popping out horses?

3689
02:34:30,470 --> 02:34:34,430
They take like four to five years to grow.

3690
02:34:34,830 --> 02:34:41,990
Oh my god.

3691
02:34:42,430 --> 02:34:45,230
I need to cool down.

3692
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:51,230
The horses just kept breeding.

3693
02:34:57,530 --> 02:34:58,970
Oh my god.

3694
02:34:59,090 --> 02:35:00,950
That was fun though.

3695
02:35:01,170 --> 02:35:02,710
That was really fun.

3696
02:35:03,450 --> 02:35:09,930
I got overwhelmed by all the horses.

3697
02:35:10,930 --> 02:35:12,470
The elves fucked me up.

3698
02:35:12,710 --> 02:35:15,850
The elves and the ENTs fucked me up.

3699
02:35:16,430 --> 02:35:20,430
And then the stables kept pumping them out like rabbits.

3700
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:23,190
And then I was like...

3701
02:35:23,190 --> 02:35:26,290
I needed to put the game down.

3702
02:35:26,290 --> 02:35:27,010
I needed...

3703
02:35:27,010 --> 02:35:28,810
I needed...

3704
02:35:30,970 --> 02:35:33,910
I needed to put the game down.

3705
02:35:33,990 --> 02:35:37,070
Or I was actually going to go outside and punch a horse.

3706
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:39,590
I was going to fight a horse.

3707
02:35:39,830 --> 02:35:41,930
I was going to eat horse meat.

3708
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:45,290
I would 100% google a restaurant.

3709
02:35:45,590 --> 02:35:50,550
And I'm going to buy four stacks of glue.

3710
02:35:50,970 --> 02:35:51,670
Or some shit.

3711
02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:54,530
And I'm going to go to Ikea and buy their meatballs.

3712
02:35:54,730 --> 02:35:56,410
Like I don't fucking care anymore.

3713
02:35:56,570 --> 02:36:00,430
I'll find a mountie and I'm going to slap that horse's ass.

3714
02:36:00,490 --> 02:36:02,970
And I was like... I'm going to kill you.

3715
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:07,430
Oh my god.

3716
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:09,950
I have become the horse auntie.

3717
02:36:10,390 --> 02:36:16,410
I didn't even realize there were faces around the main face.

3718
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:18,930
I found that out when I did the...

3719
02:36:18,930 --> 02:36:22,190
The fog of war thing.

3720
02:36:22,310 --> 02:36:26,250
I did the fog of war and there was a face right next to me.

3721
02:36:26,390 --> 02:36:28,190
And at that point I was done.

3722
02:36:28,290 --> 02:36:30,630
I was done.

3723
02:36:31,470 --> 02:36:31,990
Oh.

3724
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:35,130
Alright guys.

3725
02:36:35,210 --> 02:36:36,310
I'm going to call it here.

3726
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:39,330
I hope you guys enjoyed today's stream.

3727
02:36:39,610 --> 02:36:41,850
Today's battle of miller stream.

3728
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:45,030
At least I killed the fellowship.

3729
02:36:45,030 --> 02:36:49,650
At least I got to kill Gimli, Legolas, and the rest.

3730
02:36:53,370 --> 02:36:54,390
Anyway guys.

3731
02:36:54,910 --> 02:36:55,930
As always everybody.

3732
02:36:56,670 --> 02:36:57,730
Stay hydrated.

3733
02:36:58,050 --> 02:36:58,750
Posture check.

3734
02:36:59,070 --> 02:37:01,470
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3735
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:05,710
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

3736
02:37:05,930 --> 02:37:07,870
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

3737
02:37:08,290 --> 02:37:09,510
Bye guys.

3738
02:37:10,010 --> 02:37:10,590
Bye.
