1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Frank, these are... iron sights.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,900
The only knife in the world with iron sights, because I need you to aim that cut right here.

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,660
I don't want the same fate as Frank.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,380
Oh, so you don't trust me?

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:21,680
No!

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm weeks past right, and I've wasted three days on you with a foot in the compost pile.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:35,260
You try to stab me with chopsticks, you psychoanalyze me with the doki board, which, by the way, cutting boards don't talk, so I don't know how that even...

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,240
You told my entire bat story in metaphorical bento flashbacks!

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,180
That's...

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,200
You owe me.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,840
Now cut me open and wear my skin!

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,200
This is insane.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm not going to...

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,060
This is my final request.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,860
The mold... I can't feel my seeds anymore!

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,940
This is what I made the knife for!

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,660
Wait, you designed it... to cut tomatoes?

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,780
67 layers of Damascus are on a VG-10 core.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,560
Hardened to 61 HRC, so she stays sharp.

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,060
And other blades would just go...

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,600
Squish!

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,840
That tomato!

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,620
I slipped on that tomato.

24
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,060
I squished one.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,420
Frank...

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,160
He didn't expect life to...

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,440
catch up to him so fast.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
That's why I made the handle the way it is.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,120
A pistol grip.

30
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,340
No slipping.

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,280
Easier to hold with a recessed choil.

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,940
I studied your old videos...

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,960
Before...

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,200
Before the incident.

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,080
Perfect for your print script.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,780
And...

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,280
NO HARMACY!

38
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,160
Carbon fiber scales with golden foil because I...

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,500
I want it to be memorable.

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,280
No way that I'll... never be.

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,320
I... I even made rivets that looked like her eyes when she was locked in and...

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,560
But...

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,580
Why would you want to be cut and burn?

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,760
Instead of like... I don't know... being cooked.

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,220
When the cut happens...

46
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,560
It's irreversible.

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,880
You can't uncut something.

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,100
And...

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,440
I saw that and it got...

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,900
A bit scared I guess.

51
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,400
Even something that looks perfect on the outside...

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,380
Might not be doing so hot on the inside.

53
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,020
You prepared me?

54
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,680
To prepare you.

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,820
Yeah, I guess you could look at it that way.

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,000
Sometimes you need to take a step back and...

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Invest everything in others winning instead.

58
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,640
And this time...

59
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,400
I guess it's you, microwave cook.

60
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,980
Tell her...

61
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,800
Tell her the third tomato made it too.

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,700
Tell her we'll be able to laugh together again.

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,420
Now...

64
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,200
Do it!

65
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,500
Cut me open and wear my skin.

66
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,980
Don't miss.

67
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,780
I won't.
