1
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,220
You guys... you guys were in here, but we were leaking.

4
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,200
Leaks?

5
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,800
Leaks?

6
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,400
Leaks?

7
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,920
Leaks?

8
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,180
That's right.

9
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,740
That's why we were late a little bit too, because we were gossiping.

10
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,060
Oh my god.

11
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,540
We were talking about you behind your back.

12
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,820
Oh my god, and then they said...

13
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,200
You'll never know what we're talking about.

14
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,640
That's messed up.

15
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey, it could be good things.

16
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
Right, Vin?

17
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,160
I said some good stuff about Chad.

18
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,160
I don't know about you, though.

19
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,720
Oh, yeah, they're totally gonna believe that.

20
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,820
They could... they're gonna be like...

21
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,100
That's my streamer, Ducky.

22
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,120
She always says good things about us.

23
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,740
I do!

24
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,740
You whiz!

25
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,000
I've never.

26
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,220
I've never.

27
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,380
There's so many clips about...

28
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,500
About like, what is it?

29
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,820
She hates us.

30
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,180
Like, what's that, huh?

31
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,260
No, they're saying that in your chat, which means you hate them.

32
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
That came from your chat.

34
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,420
That came from you.

35
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,260
No, this is not my stream.

36
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,840
This is not my channel.

37
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,060
But you're here.

38
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,360
Everything...

39
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,840
Everything... So it like...

40
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,760
I don't know, I don't...

41
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,300
I don't take ownership of this.

42
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,660
Mints hate us.

43
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,420
What do you say Mint hates us?

44
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:27,680
No, Doki hates us.

45
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,540
No, I see Mint hate us.

46
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:29,860
Doki hates us.

47
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,440
Minto hates us and Doki's cat.

48
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,980
Jean says Minto loves us, and Hugh C says Doki hates us.

49
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,120
Okay, well, if I put a poll right now...

50
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,880
It would be 50-50.

51
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,400
Okay, okay.

52
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,320
Does Mint hate us?

53
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,980
No, no, no.

54
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,900
It's gotta be who hates us more, Doki and Mint.

55
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,840
That's too late.

56
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,380
You said it's 50-50.

57
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,820
Yes!

58
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,500
Oh, look at that!

59
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,120
Oh, it's 77!

60
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,280
I don't think 77...

61
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,500
Oh, wait, it's going down.

62
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,940
Make it 50-50, make it 50-50.

63
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

64
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,860
Make it 80%.

65
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,460
Make it 50-50.

66
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,040
Make it 80%.

67
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,860
Oh, it's 71% right now.

68
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,860
This is... This is...

69
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,180
You are... It's on your channel.

70
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,700
They're biased.

71
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,100
Of course, they're going to listen to you.

72
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,060
Thanks for the Akasupa.

73
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,440
Thanks for the Akasupa.

74
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,160
For it to ask Mint something.

75
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,180
I mean...

76
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,180
Oh.

77
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,680
I appreciate it.

78
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,540
Oh, it's not my channel.

79
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,920
Oh, it's at 69.

80
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
No, stay at 69.

81
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:38,860
Nice.

82
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,720
69.

83
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,180
It's alright.

84
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,560
See?

85
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,460
Look, I knew it.

86
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,960
I was right.

87
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,480
I'm always right, guys.

88
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,630
I'm always right.

89
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:50,550
I'm always right.

90
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,450
Okay, so today we are...

91
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,390
What?

92
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,530
I was dehydrating!

93
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:55,750
Uh-huh.

94
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,170
Today, um...

95
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,990
We are playing potentially the final chapter of Visage.

96
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,070
And, uh...

97
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,670
We are going to have a guide out.

98
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,490
We're not going to...

99
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,350
We're going to be transparent with all of you guys.

100
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,610
And that we're going to have a guide out.

101
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,630
Because we realize there's no...

102
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,170
There's not really a way to start chapter four.

103
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,270
Um...

104
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,950
Because we're trying to find things.

105
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,650
And what we're trying to find are, like, tapes or whatever.

106
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,990
And I'm pretty sure I do not have all the tapes that we're supposed to get.

107
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,150
So...

108
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,330
So we will need a guide for that.

109
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,610
Um...

110
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,370
Or we'll potentially never finish this game, which is something I do not want to go through.

111
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:37,650
Um...

112
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,390
This is the final arc in the minute.

113
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,490
I will never collab ever again.

114
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,650
This is...

115
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:45,990
Never again!

116
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,490
This is it!

117
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,590
This is the last time!

118
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,070
This is the last time!

119
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,830
For Charity!

120
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,370
For Charity!

121
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,170
She only came back for Charity!

122
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,390
Yeah, you only came back for Charity.

123
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,230
What?

124
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,570
I'm still trying to find a walkthrough.

125
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,910
Hold on.

126
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,570
Wait, you still haven't found a guide yet?

127
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,070
No.

128
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,350
No!

129
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,970
The end of the contract.

130
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,390
Yeah, she signed a contract.

131
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,890
Oh, here we go, here we go.

132
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,090
Okay.

133
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,990
When she had to do like...

134
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,730
Like, it was like six streams for 2025 and I already reached the quota.

135
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,210
I feel like we got most of these.

136
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,370
There's this one and probably this one.

137
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,770
Two.

138
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,190
I think there's two that we need to get.

139
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,590
Alright, there's two?

140
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,310
Okay, let me boot up the game.

141
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,330
Alright, so also I told...

142
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,310
Yeah, I didn't even...

143
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,530
I told Mint that I can't drink today.

144
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,730
You guys know I can't drink right now.

145
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,390
Because I am sick and I don't want to make it worse.

146
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:44,690
So, because I cannot drink, I might be a lot more scared and a lot more slow.

147
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,750
Oh, we got past all the scary stuff.

148
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,690
You don't know that?

149
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,950
You don't fucking know that?

150
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,930
Wait, literally went through the whole game?

151
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,890
What else is there?

152
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,430
Chapter four!

153
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,190
There's not gonna be anything scary.

154
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,990
What do you mean?

155
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,870
Okay, you don't even...

156
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,330
No, you're not even playing the game!

157
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,910
Um...

158
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,570
I heard they might...

159
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,370
I heard they might release Visage 2.

160
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,350
You should try it.

161
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,150
2?

162
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:12,870
Yeah!

163
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:13,470
No!

164
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,450
I don't know if my chat was memeing me, but they're like...

165
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,290
Oh, they don't know.

166
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,710
Chapter two might come out.

167
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,190
Is that actually true or people were just fucking with me?

168
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:21,970
They're...

169
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,130
They're messing with you.

170
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:23,950
Were they?

171
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,690
Oh yeah, they were.

172
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,550
I don't see anything.

173
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,850
I literally Googled Visage 2 and they're like...

174
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,510
You got one guide?

175
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,270
I got one guide.

176
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,390
Actually, I got two guides.

177
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,030
I ego-searched.

178
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,410
Two!

179
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:33,970
That's the worst.

180
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,190
You know that moment when you ego-search and...

181
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,950
And people were like, oh, Visage 2?

182
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,030
Yeah.

183
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,470
You were ego-searching and you found out?

184
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,010
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,930
I was, you know...

186
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,310
I was ego-searching myself on Twitter and I saw someone was like...

187
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,770
Oh man, she doesn't know there's a Visage 2.

188
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,210
So I got two guys.

189
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:56,970
Okay, you deserve that.

190
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,970
You deserve that actually.

191
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,810
You actively stalk your fans!

192
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:01,570
Don't...

193
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,290
No, I don't!

194
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,210
They show up!

195
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,210
They show up in my feed!

196
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,390
Because you keep stalking them!

197
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,710
So it triggers the algorithm!

198
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,410
Like, that's what it does!

199
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:21,350
You actively look up your fans' untag post that it now shows up on your algorithm.

200
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,690
It's not my fault that Twitter is so aggressive about it.

201
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,810
They...

202
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,370
They...

203
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:26,570
They...

204
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:26,810
They...

205
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,590
It's called the algorithm for a reason!

206
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,130
Oh no!

207
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,970
She's obsessed with us!

208
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,290
Then...

209
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,750
No...

210
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,930
Clearly you guys say that I hate you because it's 73%.

211
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,930
Yeah, but like...

212
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,430
You know like those people who like hate them so much that they want that they hate watch?

213
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,050
You...

214
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,830
You hate stalk your fans!

215
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,970
I hate stalk!

216
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,830
Can you share the game?

217
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,370
Okay, I didn't even boot up the game yet.

218
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,790
Boot up the game!

219
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,210
She's stalling, everybody!

220
00:10:59,490 --> 00:10:59,790
She's stalling!

221
00:10:59,790 --> 00:10:59,850
She's stalling!

222
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,970
I'm always stalling!

223
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,970
This is...

224
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,870
This is the whole reason...

225
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,470
We start the game like 20 minutes in every time.

226
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,110
Alright, let's see...

227
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,650
Guys, I have a guide!

228
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,890
And I'm the guide for today!

229
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,170
Okay, the last...

230
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,230
Before stream!

231
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:16,990
Before stream!

232
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,810
I told Doki, leave it to me!

233
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,010
I don't believe you!

234
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,670
Okay...

235
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,730
Alright...

236
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,250
Alright...

237
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,010
Let's see...

238
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,730
Okay, we can...

239
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,110
You see the game feed?

240
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,650
Yeah, I see the game.

241
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,950
Alright, here we go.

242
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,470
This is the last time...

243
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,590
Guys, how's the volume?

244
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,410
Is it too quiet for her?

245
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,550
The game hasn't even started yet!

246
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,050
The game hasn't even started yet!

247
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,270
Turn it up all the way up.

248
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,930
The game hasn't even started yet!

249
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,710
We're literally loading in!

250
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,570
We're back in church, though.

251
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,110
Okay, guys, I need to know...

252
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,970
Wait, why am I here?

253
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,990
Where are you?

254
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,810
Wait, how did I get here?

255
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,190
How did I...

256
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,610
Wait...

257
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,550
You beat the game...

258
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,670
You beat it, right?

259
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,310
Oh, I remember how I got here.

260
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,550
Oh my god, to go back to the breaker room.

261
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:07,570
Wait...

262
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,430
Oh, that's right, the breaker.

263
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,050
Oh my god...

264
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,570
Well, you have to go to the basement anyway for one of the tapes.

265
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,650
Oh, fuck.

266
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,550
It's just a tape.

267
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,170
I don't know where the breaker room is!

268
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,690
Yes, you do!

269
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,910
You know where that is.

270
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,390
No, I don't!

271
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,210
Yes, you do!

272
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,770
It's by the TV...

273
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,590
All the way down the hallway.

274
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,230
That door at the very end.

275
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,750
Oh, okay.

276
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:32,890
Alright.

277
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,090
Stupid fucking ghost.

278
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,710
Right there.

279
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:37,890
Right there.

280
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,010
Stupid ghost.

281
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,230
Come on.

282
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,750
What are you saying stupid ghost for?

283
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,190
They're stupid.

284
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,450
They know they are.

285
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,210
What?

286
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:45,810
Wait, did I do it?

287
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,530
Oh, I did.

288
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,970
Okay.

289
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,610
I think so.

290
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,850
Alright, alright.

291
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,050
Before...

292
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,890
Okay, let me pause the game.

293
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,350
Already?

294
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,770
Okay.

295
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,250
What does the guide say?

296
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,550
You know the area that says the basement rules?

297
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,670
Yeah?

298
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:02,970
Yeah, go there.

299
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,390
It's in one of the drawers.

300
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,170
Wait, didn't we already get those videos?

301
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,450
I don't know.

302
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,090
I'm just...

303
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,630
That's one of the ones we might be missing.

304
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,230
Oh, I forgot.

305
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,270
I'm dual wielding.

306
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,310
Okay, so...

307
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,490
I can't remember.

308
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,910
What I need to know is if...

309
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,170
For the candles...

310
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:16,650
Like...

311
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,310
Right here.

312
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,850
In this little drawer thing.

313
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,630
On the second...

314
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:21,870
Okay.

315
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,070
Oh, yeah.

316
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,950
Okay, so you already got that one.

317
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,490
Okay.

318
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,030
Okay, so I have one question.

319
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,010
It's for the candles.

320
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,730
So, like, for the candles...

321
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,090
Don't leave.

322
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,510
Don't leave it.

323
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,230
Yeah.

324
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,510
Yeah.

325
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,790
Like, do they...

326
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,930
Do they restore my sanity?

327
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,510
Yes, I think so.

328
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,990
Okay.

329
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,430
Oh, gosh.

330
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,230
Okay.

331
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,510
I'm...

332
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,350
I'm not okay.

333
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,010
Okay, so now you're gonna go into the boiler room.

334
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,690
I don't know if we got this one either.

335
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,570
That's the storage room.

336
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,590
I don't know where the fuck the boiler room is.

337
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,010
The boiler room is...

338
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,470
It's in a corridor behind the wall to the left of the TV is what it says.

339
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,190
What?

340
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,390
So, go to the TV.

341
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,230
Okay, let's go to the tapes and see what videos we're missing.

342
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,010
Like, I think that's...

343
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,990
So, we don't have to do it.

344
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,310
There's only...

345
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,770
Only two down here.

346
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:11,930
Just...

347
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,170
It's...

348
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,310
I think it's...

349
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,030
Wait, what?

350
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,350
Maybe the thing is busted.

351
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:18,890
Fucking...

352
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,050
Okay.

353
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,530
Yeah.

354
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:22,710
Alright.

355
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,650
Alright, I guess we'll go see what tapes are missing.

356
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,210
Turn around.

357
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,910
Okay, give me a sec.

358
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,290
Let me turn on all the lights.

359
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,050
Let me...

360
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,850
Let me make sure all the lights are on.

361
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,130
So I don't...

362
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,050
There's a candle right there.

363
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,210
Is that not a candle?

364
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,330
Yeah.

365
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:37,670
Oh.

366
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,090
Oh my god.

367
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:39,630
What is this?

368
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,410
Wait, I can just put...

369
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,390
Oh, I could just put it there.

370
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:44,990
Alright.

371
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,010
Oh, oh, okay.

372
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,350
Oh, what are you doing?

373
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,650
Is it on?

374
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,410
I don't...

375
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:50,950
I don't know.

376
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,770
I'm trying to fucking put a candle on.

377
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,130
Do you know how candles work?

378
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,870
Oh my god, apparently I don't!

379
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,810
Okay, there you go.

380
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,770
I did it.

381
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,590
Candles, how does it work?

382
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,630
Okay.

383
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:01,910
Okay.

384
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,970
Okay, I have one, two, three, four.

385
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,330
I have four.

386
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,050
Four?

387
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,870
Wait.

388
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,030
I have pride.

389
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,590
Did you change it?

390
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,710
There's a child there.

391
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,470
Look at this out.

392
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,650
Wait, you only have four?

393
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,210
Yeah.

394
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,070
Is that bad?

395
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,010
Okay, you have pride.

396
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,750
Do you have negligence?

397
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,350
Wait, let me drop this.

398
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,210
Okay, so...

399
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,750
Alright, there's...

400
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,510
There's that.

401
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,630
I'm watching the video.

402
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,550
I don't know.

403
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,750
We don't care about the video.

404
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,110
Oh, okay.

405
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,150
We care about the tape.

406
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,630
Wait, okay.

407
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,130
Um...

408
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,070
We have pride.

409
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,750
Alright, put it into the little slot on the left.

410
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,430
Store.

411
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:42,850
Oh.

412
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,850
Alright, so...

413
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,710
We have...

414
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,970
We have prison.

415
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:47,510
Pride.

416
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,330
Oh, prison.

417
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,150
Prison.

418
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,230
We have indifference.

419
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,790
We have addiction.

420
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:53,910
Okay.

421
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,650
And we have pride.

422
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:55,890
Okay.

423
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,330
So...

424
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,870
We need greed, which was in the basement like I fucking told you.

425
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,210
Okay, we didn't know that because we got a video that I already have.

426
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:05,850
I did!

427
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,690
I didn't know!

428
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,110
Okay.

429
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,310
I did know!

430
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,190
No, you didn't.

431
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:09,910
No, you didn't.

432
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,450
Yes, I did.

433
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,890
Yes, I did.

434
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,610
That's why I told you to go to the trailer room!

435
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:14,870
Prove it!

436
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,810
Okay, and then what else do we have?

437
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,270
I go prove it because I know you haven't been in there!

438
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,470
No, you don't.

439
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,650
You don't even know where it was.

440
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,630
I told you!

441
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,130
It's in the boiler room!

442
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,170
Okay, what's the other video?

443
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,050
What's the other video?

444
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,470
I don't know where that boiler room is!

445
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,030
Okay, but like, what's the other video?

446
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,270
Um, the other one is in the progress room.

447
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,390
Okay, I'll grab that one first.

448
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,910
Oh wait, no, sorry.

449
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,030
Once you step out of the progress room, go down...

450
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,270
Oh wait, there's a cabinet across from the sofa.

451
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:44,970
Okay.

452
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,630
That I can do.

453
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,130
Yeah.

454
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,470
A cabinet across from the sofa.

455
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,290
Yeah, it says once you step out of the progress room, go down the corridor to the right and there will be a den area.

456
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,310
There will be a long cabinet across...

457
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:01,990
Oh, I think it's that.

458
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,150
Uh, on the left.

459
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,970
That one right there.

460
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:04,710
That one?

461
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,270
Okay, let me turn on the lights.

462
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,830
With this one?

463
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,670
There's one in there.

465
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,130
Somewhere.

466
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,250
Those are books.

467
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,870
Oh, there's...

468
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,490
There's videos.

469
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,150
There's also a second side.

470
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,310
Those are books.

471
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,250
It's on the other side.

472
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,230
Oh, I literally see it.

473
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,130
I literally see it.

474
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,610
I see it too, but you made me open the wrong cabinet.

475
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,610
Oh my god!

476
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,030
It's a whole cabinet!

477
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,430
Um, it's two cabinets!

478
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,910
It's two!

479
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,250
Oh my god.

480
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,410
You could have said left or right.

481
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,050
It didn't tell me!

482
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,370
Spanish or English.

483
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:38,590
What?

484
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,630
It...

485
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,070
Why is that there?

486
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,790
Why is that there?

487
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,410
Yeah.

488
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,590
Why is that there?

489
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,510
Wait, it was there.

490
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,670
It was there when you walked past.

491
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,330
No, it wasn't.

492
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,970
No, it wasn't.

493
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,330
It was.

494
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,770
It was.

495
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,290
I did not see that before.

496
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,950
But I don't know.

497
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,510
I didn't...

498
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,690
I didn't pay attention to it.

499
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,030
Me too.

500
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,250
Yuck.

501
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,770
We know.

502
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,650
We know.

503
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,250
Okay.

504
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,150
Uh...

505
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,670
So now you can put in...

506
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:00,950
Indifference.

507
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,430
Oh no, sorry.

508
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,150
That was...

509
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,910
Affliction.

510
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,690
And now we gotta go get Greed.

511
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,470
Alright.

512
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,630
Wait, no.

513
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,170
We have two more.

514
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,950
We're missing two more.

515
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,830
What?

516
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,550
That one was all over the bottom...

517
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,050
First one.

518
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,350
So we're still missing two more.

519
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:13,950
Oh!

520
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,530
Okay.

521
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,810
Um...

522
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,690
Greed and...

523
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,890
Can I die in the loading room?

524
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,410
Can I...

525
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,870
Guys, can I die in the...

526
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,090
Stop moving!

527
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,270
I didn't go!

528
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,310
I didn't go!

529
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,410
I'm trying to see!

530
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,110
It's literally the next two videos!

531
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,070
Not the last two!

532
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,050
Before addiction and after...

533
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,150
There's only!

534
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,550
Before addiction and after...

535
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,910
Before addiction and after indifference.

536
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,050
Do you have negligence?

537
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,170
Wait, I can?

538
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,330
How do people kill me?

539
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,830
This is the level select!

540
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,470
Do you have negligence?

541
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,150
No.

542
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,250
Okay.

543
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,070
We need that.

544
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,490
Um, it's from Dolores' chapter.

545
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,690
Okay, but we're in Dolores' chapter.

546
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,450
Uh, complete the chapter...

547
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,830
Then enter the parents' room.

548
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,550
Okay.

549
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,210
Wait, do I have negligence?

550
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:01,670
Let me see.

551
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,970
I never actually...

552
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,130
I never really know.

553
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,990
I think we need negligence in green.

554
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,030
Okay.

555
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,410
That's in the parents' room.

556
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,290
So apparently I can die here.

557
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,730
So, like, that's not cool.

558
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:11,770
Well, it's all right.

559
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,590
You're not gonna die.

560
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,270
It's fine.

561
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,890
Okay, what if, like, somebody goes peekaboo and then I die?

562
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,610
Well, I mean, that would have happened anyway.

563
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,150
Okay, so, on the ground... I thought we grabbed this one.

564
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,210
Right there, that tape right there.

565
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:26,410
Oh, I did.

566
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

567
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,950
Oh, I think, like, we did, but, like, it wasn't... It didn't save.

568
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,390
I must have, yeah, because I remember seeing this one.

569
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:34,550
Yeah.

570
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,850
Okay, that's why I thought we had it.

571
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,070
Okay, then we're good, and now we go to the basement.

572
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,490
All right.

573
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,750
Okay, that means if I can die here, I should save.

574
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,770
Oh, well, I... I was gonna say quick save.

575
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,530
Okay, um, apparently you can die in this... in the level select.

576
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,770
But we're... our sanity is so fine.

577
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,730
We're not gonna die.

578
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,150
It's fine.

579
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,350
Okay, all famous last words.

580
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,130
All right.

581
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,710
Okay, to the basement.

582
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,630
I think I know where the boiler room is.

583
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,250
Okay, so, remember there was, like, that hallway that you had to follow the scribbles in in the basement?

584
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:06,610
No.

585
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,570
Of course you don't.

586
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:09,430
What?

587
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,550
I never remember.

588
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,330
That's the best part about me.

589
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,950
Okay, go to the TV.

590
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:17,950
Okay.

591
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:18,770
Yeah.

592
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,590
And turn that way, yeah.

593
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,950
Turn to the left.

594
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,290
Yep.

595
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,290
Down that hall.

596
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,490
Wait, I can put a candle here.

597
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,350
And it's in that room that's open.

598
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,870
Let me put a candle here.

599
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:29,870
Okay.

600
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,450
Oh, wait.

601
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,310
Now you care about the candles.

602
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:32,810
Okay.

603
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,790
Um, yes, because it actually helps me out.

604
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,910
And it's behind the boiler.

605
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,270
Oh, there it is.

606
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,470
See?

607
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,630
That's how I knew you hadn't gotten it.

608
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,050
Because why would you have checked there?

609
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,190
Okay.

610
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,170
Let me grab this.

611
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,630
All right.

612
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,510
Now what do we do?

613
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:49,910
Now...

614
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:57,250
Once you get them all... Once you... All the tapes have been collected, you'll need to play them in the VCR.

615
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,930
Keep them... Uh, yeah.

616
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,090
So...

617
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,070
Wait, give me a sec.

618
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,630
I need to grab a candle up.

619
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,250
Why?

620
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,270
You're going upstairs.

621
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,210
Because I need to light the candle!

622
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,350
Okay, I'm gonna try and not follow the guide now.

623
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,850
Okay.

624
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,030
All right.

625
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:15,350
Okay.

626
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,230
Oh my god.

627
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:16,650
Okay.

628
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,410
All right.

629
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:23,270
Now... Now we can watch the video and hope we don't die in the level select.

630
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,550
We won't die!

631
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:30,410
Because if we die during the level select, we have to do this all over again.

632
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,030
It was only three tapes.

633
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,530
Okay.

634
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,070
It was three tapes.

635
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,470
That is still three too many.

636
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,790
You can't use that here?

637
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,330
I think you... There... What?

638
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:38,710
What?

639
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,050
Why don't you just put it inside the...

640
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,210
No.

641
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,810
Just put it in.

642
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,230
No.

643
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,870
Yeah, put it in.

644
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,190
Yeah, just put it in.

645
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:45,670
No.

646
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,050
Yes!

647
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,750
Just put it in!

648
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:47,930
Okay, fine.

649
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,810
I need... I want to put the first tape in!

650
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,030
Okay, nice.

651
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,810
I don't think it matters.

652
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,570
Yes, it does.

653
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,310
It's... We gotta watch in order.

654
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,390
Okay.

655
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,250
All right.

656
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,470
Here you go.

657
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,210
Affliction.

658
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,370
Affliction.

659
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,510
Now watch the video.

660
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:02,650
All right.

661
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,870
Oh, baby.

662
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,990
There's a baby.

663
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,690
Stop.

664
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,170
I'm just wondering if something's coming over here!

665
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,350
Nothing's coming!

666
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,090
What is...

667
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:13,350
Oh.

668
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,750
Oh.

669
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,370
What's that?

670
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,530
Wait, that's the well.

671
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,550
The well, yeah.

672
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,450
How'd you get in the well?

673
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,630
Why is...

674
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,390
We're gonna be cursed after watching this.

675
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,870
It's gonna ring.

676
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,030
A woman starts coming out of the TV.

677
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,550
Oh, wait.

678
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,490
Jesus is behind me.

679
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,210
He'll protect me.

680
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,430
Yeah, he'll protect us.

681
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,410
Jesus got your back.

682
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,830
Yeah, Jesus got me.

683
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,210
What the fuck is that?

684
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,250
What is that?

685
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,270
In seven days, we'll come back to Visage.

686
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,790
Oh, no!

687
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,370
In seven days, a part five of Visage comes out and it's just a video of us.

688
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,350
Oh, my God.

689
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,810
...crawling out of the TV.

690
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,890
Unless you send this stream to five friends!

691
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,450
Okay, I think that's the whole baby, right?

692
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,290
Yeah.

693
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,130
But, like, where do we...

694
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,070
There's a well?

695
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,130
I never saw a well.

696
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,790
We gotta...

697
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,190
Where the fuck is that?

698
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,990
There's other clues.

699
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,030
We gotta...

700
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,290
We gotta watch the other tapes.

701
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,950
No, I think, like, each tape tells us to go somewhere.

702
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,150
But where is that?

703
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,110
No, I don't think so.

704
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,950
It says, um...

705
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,550
Each tape will show scenes from a home video and flash a clue in certain segments in between.

706
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,670
Oh, okay.

707
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,990
Wait, once you finish playing a tape, something will occur in the house that will open up a secret area.

708
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,670
Oh!

709
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,810
Oh!

710
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:31,850
Okay.

711
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,630
Maybe we should not watch all of them at once.

712
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,270
Yeah, I was gonna say, maybe that was a bad idea.

713
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,870
Oh, we're venting!

714
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,550
We're venting?

715
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,010
Venting, okay.

716
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,070
A little gear.

717
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,470
I mean...

718
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,250
Oh, I don't like that.

719
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,590
That's my baby.

720
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:46,990
I...

721
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,030
I don't...

722
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,630
What?

723
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,130
Who's the father?

724
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,050
Me.

725
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,690
Oh, you're like those liz...

726
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,750
Oh, I don't like that.

727
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,190
I...

728
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,330
Oh, I don't like that.

729
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,470
I think you're gonna have to go in there.

730
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,010
Oh.

731
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,130
Oh, hey, there's that bird.

732
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:03,770
It's you!

733
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:04,650
It's me!

734
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,390
Gah!

735
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,690
There's Kroki!

736
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,270
Gah!

737
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,630
Okay.

738
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,530
I guess that's all of the video.

739
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,310
Okay.

740
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,870
All right, so we have two videos.

741
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,570
Greed and the other one.

742
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,470
Yeah.

743
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,370
All right, let's put those two back.

744
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,010
Actually, we keep holding it so we know that we...

745
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,810
Yeah, what we watched, right?

746
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:23,770
Um...

747
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,110
Where is the two?

748
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,710
Um...

749
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,270
Why don't you look around the house a little bit?

750
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,870
Okay.

751
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,990
Why are we speedrunning, huh?

752
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,090
Um...

753
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,970
It's not like I have to scroll through the guide to find out, anyway.

754
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,090
Wait, we watched what?

755
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,190
We watched Greed and...

756
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,770
It's Greed and...

757
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,150
Let me...

758
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,210
I think it was Affliction.

759
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,090
Let me look.

760
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,150
It was Greed and...

761
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,550
Affliction, yeah.

762
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:47,430
Okay.

763
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,570
I don't feel so good.

764
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,150
Which one do you want to do first?

765
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,270
Let's do...

766
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,150
Let's do the creepy...

767
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,370
Um...

768
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:55,910
Well thing.

769
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,110
Let's do the ring one first.

770
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,470
The ring one I feel more comfort in in the...

771
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,410
In your baby.

772
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,090
Oh, I think it's up here.

773
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,910
What's going on there?

774
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,770
Oh, I think I can die now.

775
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,110
Wait, the table must be something, no?

776
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,570
The table right there?

777
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,570
They said don't grab it yet.

778
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,630
I think I can die now.

779
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,630
Why?

780
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,250
This does not look safe.

781
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,410
Oh, that thing's been swinging the whole time.

782
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,290
No, I meant that.

783
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,090
Oh, the mold.

784
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,970
The black...

785
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,270
The black mold?

786
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,790
That came from your fridge, no?

787
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,490
That...

788
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,130
I think...

789
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,670
Oh, yeah, it's true.

790
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,210
My fridge.

791
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,370
I haven't cleaned in a while.

792
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,390
That might be why I'm sick.

793
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,630
Yeah, I am.

794
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:39,870
Okay.

795
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,370
We've all got a little bit of mold.

796
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,390
Got a little bit of mold inside of us.

797
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,170
Okay, so...

798
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:45,190
Yeah.

799
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:45,830
Where should I go?

800
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,770
Downstairs, right?

801
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,910
I feel like...

802
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,050
Okay, affliction.

803
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,690
Oh, there's a lot of them.

804
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,310
Yeah, there's a lot of mold.

805
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,150
I don't feel comfortable anymore.

806
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,650
It says you need the crowbar, so you're gonna have to get it from the storage room.

807
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,390
Okay.

808
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,970
Why is there a lot of black mold now?

809
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:06,730
I...

810
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,710
I thought this was supposed to be the good end.

811
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,250
Oh, my God.

812
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,790
I need to have two hands!

813
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:19,930
I hate the...

814
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,070
The inventory management in this game actually makes, like...

815
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,610
Tilt...

816
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,210
Makes me tilt it.

817
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:24,890
It's so bad.

818
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,770
I don't understand!

819
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,250
If...

820
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:29,950
Pick it up!

821
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,010
What do you mean I can only have two?

822
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,930
Oh, my God.

823
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,230
Do I have it in my...

824
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,390
Okay, I have it in my hand.

825
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,130
I have it in my hand.

826
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,810
Okay.

827
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,670
Where do I have to go?

828
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,270
You have it?

829
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:40,770
Oh, yeah.

830
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,250
Okay.

831
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,750
Um...

832
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,210
All right.

833
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,230
It feels like it's gonna take you a while to read this.

834
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,050
Let me...

835
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,530
Return to the first floor and enter the room with the mirror on the door.

836
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,850
The mirror on the door?

837
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,350
Oh, the one where we started the granny!

838
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,410
The granny chapter.

839
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,490
I remember where that is.

840
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,290
Maybe.

841
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:07,550
All right.

842
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,310
All right.

843
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,990
The granny chapter.

844
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,810
Okay.

845
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,350
So, it's here.

846
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,770
I do not feel comfortable with the black mold.

847
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,750
Don't worry about the black mold.

848
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,330
Okay.

849
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:21,850
Wait.

850
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,510
No, there's no mirror on the door.

851
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,970
It says, uh...

852
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,510
Yeah, it says.

853
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,430
This is the mirror.

854
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,650
Oh, you're right.

855
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:26,950
You're right.

856
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,250
Yeah.

857
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,450
Look at the floorboards near the door.

858
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,210
Oh, is this?

859
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,290
Must be.

860
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,650
What do you mean you can't use that here?

861
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,350
Okay, you fucking liar.

862
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:38,490
Oh.

863
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,030
Okay.

864
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:39,510
Oh.

865
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:39,870
Oh.

866
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:42,830
All right.

867
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,230
Why is this all so convoluted?

868
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,970
There's, like, no hints.

869
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,010
How are we supposed to know?

870
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:48,630
I mean, it's different colored.

871
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,730
So, you know, like, in cartoons.

872
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,310
Tunes where something's a different color.

873
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,790
Yeah, but, like, they're just like, Hey, you need to go to the well.

874
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,290
We didn't know there was a well underneath here.

875
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,290
How are we supposed to know?

876
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,310
I don't know.

877
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,950
How do they...

878
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,870
People play this?

879
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,150
Who uses this out?

880
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,210
How do people play this without guides?

881
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,510
Oh, they have to buy the...

882
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,830
You know those little gamer guides back in the day?

883
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,010
Like...

884
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:11,850
Wait.

885
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,070
I don't need this anymore, right?

886
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,710
Let's just hope I don't need this.

887
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,030
Oh, yeah.

888
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,070
You can drop it.

889
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,310
Yeah.

890
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,490
You know, like, those gamer guides you buy at GameStop?

891
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,750
That's how I figured things out.

892
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,130
This feels like Outlast all of a sudden.

893
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,910
Like, Outlast 2.

894
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:27,570
Oh, that's...

895
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,810
Oh, I never played Outlast 2.

896
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,990
I played Outlast 1.

897
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:30,730
I thought...

898
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,930
I heard Outlast 2 isn't as good as Outlast 1.

899
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,510
Oh, hey.

900
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,150
There's the bunker.

901
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,030
Oh, there's the thing.

902
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:35,330
Yeah.

903
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:35,750
Yeah.

904
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,230
Okay.

905
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,910
Hello.

906
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:40,870
Oh, hey.

907
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:41,890
Whoa.

908
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:42,910
Whoa.

909
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,130
Okay.

910
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,570
Whoa.

911
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,570
I'm in a secret laboratory.

912
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:49,670
Factory.

913
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:50,970
What the fuck...

914
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,270
What the fuck was going on down here, Dolores?

915
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,590
Did you make this all yourself?

916
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,950
Okay.

917
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,510
I don't...

918
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,090
I feel like...

919
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,110
I feel like we're in a different game.

920
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,490
Yeah.

921
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,310
Me too.

922
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,270
Resident Evil.

923
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,490
This is Umbrella Corp right now.

924
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,290
Oh, I hope not.

925
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,250
Might be worse than Dolores.

926
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,150
Yeah, but then they give you a gun.

927
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,110
Am I going to get a gun now?

928
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,550
Oh, true.

929
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,050
True.

930
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:16,210
Yeah, true.

931
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,870
It's better because I get a gun.

932
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,110
Yeah, this feels like the guy...

933
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,890
You know that woman that built an underground mine shaft?

934
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,350
Yes!

935
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,070
The lady who just started digging underneath her.

936
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,090
Yeah.

937
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,070
And had, like, no perms to do it.

938
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,410
Yeah.

939
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,070
And she was like, I learned everything from YouTube videos.

940
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,870
Okay, you pressed it?

941
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,650
I pressed it?

942
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,930
Oh, I moved down here.

943
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,130
There's a pathway down here.

944
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,170
Okay, nice.

945
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,370
Yeah, Dolores built...

946
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:48,250
Instead of building a mine shaft, she literally built an entire fucking secret laboratory.

947
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:50,690
Oh, yeah.

948
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,310
And then, like, the government...

949
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,110
This is literally Dexter's lab.

950
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,830
Yeah, and then apparently the government had to shut her...

951
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,970
The government had to shut her down because it was, like...

952
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,090
It could have almost collapsed her entire home and her neighbor's home.

953
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:04,190
Yeah.

954
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,910
Because she was not building proper foundations.

955
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,790
She was just digging away.

956
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,510
Yeah, she was watching YouTube videos and digging away.

957
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,050
She literally had no degree for doing this.

958
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,470
Well, she also wasn't very secret about it because she was posting all of her...

959
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,470
So, like...

960
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,270
Yeah, she's like, day four, I'm building my underground mine shaft.

961
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,130
Yeah.

962
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,510
What did you think was going to happen, Dolores?

963
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,210
When she got the permit?

964
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,510
That's the...

965
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:31,750
No.

966
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:32,910
The proof?

967
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,310
The permit.

968
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,010
Wow.

969
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,890
I mean, I guess...

970
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,690
I feel sorry.

971
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,050
Where'd the ambiance go?

972
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,410
I don't like that.

973
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,750
I feel sorry for her neighbors.

974
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,930
Where'd the ambiance go?

975
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,250
Wait, I have...

976
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,030
Wait, I have to pause the game.

977
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,190
I got a call from the vet.

978
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:48,970
I'll be right back.

979
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:49,930
Oh, okay.

980
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,270
Yeah, you go entertain, chat.

981
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,670
Hey, guys.

982
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,050
How's it going?

983
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:00,870
Ugh.

984
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:01,930
Stalling.

985
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,750
This isn't stalling this time.

986
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,850
The vet's important.

987
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,410
I suppose.

988
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:11,230
Ugh, guys, I didn't like my dinner, so I'm still hungry.

989
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:12,890
Hmm.

990
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,240
Oh, man.

991
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,640
It's like the worst thing ever.

992
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,960
When you're like...

993
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,820
Want to eat something good, and then it's just...

994
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,740
Do I have snacks?

995
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,160
I have some snacks.

996
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,140
Yeah, I got some snacks.

997
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,340
What did I eat?

998
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,380
It was like a...

999
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,920
It was like a fish plate.

1000
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,700
Like some rice and fish.

1001
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,380
But...

1002
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,240
It's just...

1003
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,720
I don't...

1004
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,980
I didn't like the way the fish tasted.

1005
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,200
So...

1006
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,740
Hmm.

1007
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,580
I don't know.

1008
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,900
Hopefully it wasn't bad.

1009
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,040
Hopefully it wasn't bad.

1010
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,040
Scoop sushi.

1011
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,220
I don't think it was bad fish.

1012
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,820
It's just happening.

1013
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,940
It happens sometimes.

1014
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,740
But now I'm kind of just like...

1015
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:13,860
Ugh.

1016
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,220
I'm not satisfied.

1017
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,920
I ate.

1018
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,360
I ate most of it.

1019
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,320
But I'm like...

1020
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,640
I don't feel good about it.

1021
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,680
I want something delicious.

1022
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,460
Nutritious.

1023
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,620
Eat, Doki.

1024
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,320
I don't think I'll do that.

1025
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,240
I don't think I'll do that.

1026
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,480
Can you do a Yoda voice?

1027
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,940
Yoda say what?

1028
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,520
What is something...

1029
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,880
What is something that Yoda says?

1030
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,880
I'm not...

1031
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,940
You...

1032
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,340
What's something Yoda says?

1033
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,560
It's a funny joke.

1034
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,190
Wait.

1035
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,950
Yoda talks backwards, no?

1036
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,090
So it'd be like...

1037
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,090
It'd be like...

1038
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,030
It'd be like...

1039
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,150
Oh gosh.

1040
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,270
What?

1041
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,540
No JP grammar.

1042
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,600
Wait.

1043
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,820
He doesn't speak Japanese?

1044
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,700
Wait.

1045
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,060
No.

1046
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,260
He doesn't speak Japanese.

1047
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,580
He is...

1048
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,280
He is...

1049
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,400
He speaks...

1050
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:49,620
Wait.

1051
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,060
I don't know how Japanese grammar works.

1052
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:52,900
Wait.

1053
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,360
Uh...

1054
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,820
Um...

1055
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,200
Um...

1056
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,780
I...

1057
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,200
I...

1058
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,580
Um...

1059
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,220
Um...

1060
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,560
Um...

1061
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,040
Um...

1062
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,120
Um...

1063
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,140
Um...

1064
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,460
Yoda-chan.

1065
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,440
Hi!

1066
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,280
What do you like?

1067
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,020
Choco mint.

1068
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,620
You're more...

1069
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,180
I wonder what the Yoda JP dub sounds like.

1070
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,060
Hold on, I'm gonna look for it.

1071
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,940
I'll play it in my speaker and I'll speak it.

1072
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,140
Hold on.

1073
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,300
Hold on.

1074
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,580
Yoda.

1075
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,940
Japanese dub.

1076
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:50,390
Okay.

1077
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,430
Can you hear it?

1078
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:58,690
Wait.

1079
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,790
Which one's Yoda?

1080
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,610
Oh, that's...

1081
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,790
He just sounds like an old man.

1082
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,510
That's... That's... That's... Obi-Wan.

1083
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,450
Oh, this is Yoda.

1084
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,730
This is the Obi-Wan.

1085
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:12,570
This is Yoda.

1086
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,050
He just sounds like an old man.

1087
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,170
Wait, is this Obi-Wan in the movie?

1088
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,630
Wait, is it Obi-Wan or Obi-Wan?

1089
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,490
What does... What's his name when he meets...

1090
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,590
Wait, or...

1091
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,930
The...

1092
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,070
In the first movie?

1093
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,930
What's his name?

1094
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,410
Obi-Wan.

1095
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:37,930
Okay.

1096
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,950
Obi... Obi... Obi-Wanna.

1097
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,890
Obi-Wanna.

1098
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,470
Sushi.

1099
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,170
Ben Kenobi.

1100
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,650
Old man Ben?

1101
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,410
Who?

1102
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:52,470
Who?

1103
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,730
Who's Ben Kenobi?

1104
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,290
Wait.

1105
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,450
I thought we were talking about Obi-Wan.

1106
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,880
Wait.

1107
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,580
Obi...

1108
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,880
One...

1109
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,740
Kenobi.

1110
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,800
Legendary...

1111
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Yeah, that's the guy that meets Yoda, right?

1112
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,580
Wait.

1113
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,680
Wait.

1114
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,140
Oh, I was talking about...

1115
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,620
That wasn't Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1116
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,980
That was...

1117
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,220
Luke Skywalker.

1118
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Oh, okay.

1119
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,360
So in that clip, it was not Obi-Wan.

1120
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,280
That was Luke Skywalker talking to...

1121
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,180
To...

1122
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,740
Oh my gosh.

1123
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,380
The title of the video is literally Luke meets Yoda.

1124
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,060
All I saw was the Japanese dub part.

1125
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,460
Sorry.

1126
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,740
How long is this...

1127
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,660
To call for?

1128
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,940
Obi-Wan.

1129
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,560
No, sorry.

1130
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,640
Luke Skywalker.

1131
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,140
Do you think there's like a sky crawler?

1132
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,580
Sky runner?

1133
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,460
Sky jumper?

1134
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,240
Sky skipper?

1135
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,680
Star Wars fans frothing at the mouth?

1136
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,920
I've never seen it.

1137
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,500
I've never seen any Star Wars.

1138
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,920
I just like the way that...

1139
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,920
That...

1140
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,960
Stormtroopers look.

1141
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,860
I think they're really cute.

1142
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,700
Skycrawler.

1143
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,040
That's when he was born.

1144
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,700
He was born as Skycrawler.

1145
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,900
Then he turned into a Skywalker.

1146
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,100
Wait.

1147
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,320
He...

1148
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,860
Skywalker.

1149
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,900
So he could Skyrunner.

1150
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,820
Blade Runner.

1151
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,380
Wait.

1152
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,820
Oh my gosh.

1153
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,020
Wait.

1154
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,100
I think I'm onto something here.

1155
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,040
Oh my god.

1156
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,440
Wait.

1157
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,880
Blade Runner.

1158
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,900
He was a Skywalker.

1159
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,380
They fly.

1160
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,740
They have flying cars.

1161
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,120
Stars in Blade Runner.

1162
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,920
Oh.

1163
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:05,880
No.

1164
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:06,840
Wait.

1165
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,280
Oh my god.

1166
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,180
And Blade Runner has robots.

1167
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,100
And so does...

1168
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,420
Star Wars.

1169
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,780
And...

1170
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,120
And...

1171
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,740
And...

1172
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,860
What if...

1173
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:25,840
3CPO...

1174
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,960
No, no, no.

1175
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,500
R2-D2...

1176
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,160
Is the prototype...

1177
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,380
Of...

1178
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,820
Of...

1179
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,120
The sexy lady...

1180
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,400
That he falls in love with...

1181
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,700
In Blade Runner.

1182
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,660
So Skywalkers...

1183
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,520
So they could Blade Runner.

1184
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,380
I hardly even know her.

1185
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,660
I'm not burning anything.

1186
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,740
I'm cooking the truth.

1187
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,340
Oh my god.

1188
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,800
And Harrison Ford is in both.

1189
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,700
No way.

1190
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,460
It's inedible.

1191
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,540
It's not inedible.

1192
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,100
It's real.

1193
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,700
It's the truth.

1194
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,060
That's enough Nancy Drew for you.

1195
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,060
Hey, hey, hey.

1196
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,860
Guys.

1197
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,880
I have a question to ask.

1198
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,040
I'm not even gonna ask if I can ask it.

1199
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,680
What's your family trauma?

1200
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,680
How...

1201
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,020
If you have a family member that died...

1202
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,760
That died...

1203
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,840
How did that happen?

1204
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,060
And I need...

1205
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,600
Nobody is telling me...

1206
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,420
How the family member died.

1207
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,860
Even though it's so...

1208
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,180
It's so...

1209
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,680
Personal.

1210
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,120
But...

1211
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,260
I just have to know because I'm Nancy Drew.

1212
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,320
Eaten by mint.

1213
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,640
And that's why you have a vendetta against me.

1214
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,880
Drowned in a tub.

1215
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,760
Wait.

1216
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,680
That's what happened to Nancy Drew.

1217
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,240
Sorry.

1218
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,660
You guys don't actually have to tell me.

1219
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,400
I was...

1220
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,720
I played Nancy Drew earlier.

1221
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,620
And she just always asks...

1222
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,500
Really insensitive questions.

1223
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,140
Oh.

1224
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,780
Hello?

1225
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,720
Oh.

1226
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,340
All right.

1227
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,080
I'm back.

1228
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:31,980
Hello.

1229
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:32,920
All right.

1230
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,260
Yeah.

1231
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,800
So I told Min about what was going on earlier before the stream started.

1232
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,360
But the reason why the vet was calling is that we had to take him back to the vet again today.

1233
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,800
Because he wasn't eating last night.

1234
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,500
And he wasn't eating this morning.

1235
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,700
And he was also having diarrhea.

1236
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,660
So we were wondering if it was like a side effect from the medication he's on.

1237
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,720
Because he's on like four different types of meds.

1238
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,600
Because it was like post-surgery.

1239
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:06,240
So we had to do like several blood tests and like scans and stuff to see if there's like anything wrong with his kidneys.

1240
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,620
And so what we found out is that he might be a genetic mess.

1241
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,040
Oh no!

1242
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,460
Because like they're like, yeah, like apparently he lacks protein.

1243
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,040
And I was like, how?

1244
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,860
Like I was like, he eats so much protein.

1245
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,280
How does he lack protein?

1246
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,840
So like they're saying like, oh, he might have got by because like it was okay.

1247
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,820
But the meds might have like messed up with his like, like made it more apparent that he like couldn't, he lacked the protein.

1248
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,960
I didn't really understand food because it was all like medical jargon.

1249
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:51,820
So they might call me again because like, um, um, he obviously he was like vomiting and diarrhea.

1250
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,320
So like he was like not, uh, not comfortable with eating and stuff.

1251
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,120
Um, because he, you know, he was vomiting and stuff.

1252
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,800
So he was like not happy about it.

1253
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:11,580
Um, and then so, uh, but like he would, what's funny was that my dog sitter was like, oh yeah, like he didn't eat his dog food, but then we gave him like half a hot dog and he devoured it.

1254
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,340
It's just like, you fucker.

1255
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:24,480
He was like, I don't want dog food, but if I'm going to throw up, I'm going to eat this.

1256
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,140
I don't care.

1257
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,020
I'm going to eat this hot dog.

1258
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,420
My cat is like, it could be that he associated the food with throwing up.

1259
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:32,660
Yeah.

1260
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,300
I think that's what he last ate.

1261
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:43,520
So, so like, um, so we, he just got through, like, uh, he got through like the, we just got the results from the blood test.

1262
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:50,320
And like, obviously they're like, yeah, like he has low levels of like protein and like something else and stuff like that.

1263
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,140
And then he, they were asking me like, oh, did he ever have like vomiting issues or diarrhea issues?

1264
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I was like, not really.

1265
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:02,240
I mean, like I had like maybe like once every couple of like maybe a couple months he would suddenly randomly throw up some like saliva or water.

1266
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,640
But like, other than that, like, it's not, it doesn't happen like a lot.

1267
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,660
Like it happens like very rarely.

1268
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,460
And then they're like, oh, it might be like the medication that he was on that like, like made it worse type deal.

1269
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,440
So it made it more noticeable.

1270
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,080
So he was getting by, like, didn't really matter for him.

1271
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,940
Um, but yeah, you know how...

1272
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,780
So, and they're like, oh yeah, so are you okay with us doing more tests later?

1273
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:33,420
To make sure, like, do like a CT scan, like an ultra scan later, just to make sure of everything.

1274
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,200
And I was like, yeah, no problem.

1275
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,880
Because, you know, you know, when you, for your, for your, for your pet, you're like, just try and fix everything.

1276
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,680
And they're like, all right, we'll call you later.

1277
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,380
So you can put your deposit in.

1278
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,880
And they're like, it's not soap.

1279
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,240
And the entire house is like, okay.

1280
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:58,400
So it's like, on top of, it's another, it's another 5K going in there today.

1281
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,000
Oh my God.

1282
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,640
Are you going to an emergency vet?

1283
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,580
That's so expensive.

1284
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,580
It was like a, well, yeah, we had to take him to the ER today.

1285
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,120
Um, because like, we were worried since like, you know, he already has his back.

1286
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,380
Like, like it was post-surgery.

1287
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,760
So we were worried about like him not eating and him being dehydrated and stuff.

1288
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,060
And it's also like a specialist too, because it's for like a neurological specialist.

1289
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:35,240
And, um, uh, and so that, so that's why it's like much more expensive because like, it's actually, there's only like one spec, like there's only like one or two specialists there that focuses on like neurological problems within animals.

1290
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,580
So it's like a lot more expensive.

1291
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:46,920
But then like, you know, after the whole blood work thing and stuff like that, cause they're like, we got to have to sedate him to do the ultrasound, you know, cause it's like scanning.

1292
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,860
They're like, we're going to check to see if he ate already before, before we do this.

1293
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:58,260
And then they're like, like, we're also in the phone call and they're like, Hey, has like, has Dookie ate yet?

1294
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,900
Cause I named the dog after myself.

1295
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,320
Um,

1296
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,220
and then, and then, and then they're like, Oh, he ate everything.

1297
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,140
Oh, sorry.

1298
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,840
They're like, Oh, he ate it all.

1299
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,020
So clearly he's feeling okay now.

1300
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,660
Like right now he's feeling great because he like, apparently consumed all the dog food that he was given.

1301
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:34,920
And then they're like, Oh, so yeah, we can't really do the sedation because we didn't think he was going to eat all the food because they can sedate a pet while when they're already full.

1302
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,160
So they're like, we're going to call you later for the deposit.

1303
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,540
And also like to see if we have an open schedule because it's Friday too.

1304
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,120
So they're like, we had to do on Friday.

1305
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,000
We do it on Monday.

1306
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,500
So, Oh no, cause there's no specialist on the weekend.

1307
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:55,720
So they're like, we're going to see if there's an open schedule to, you know, have him do the scan so he could digest it and then do the scan.

1308
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,460
Why did they give him the food then?

1309
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,240
Cause like, I think they, uh, cause he didn't have any much to eat too.

1310
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:11,340
So then I, I think they didn't think I was going to go through the, the, the, the ultrasound scan cause it was like more money.

1311
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,260
And I was like, you don't understand.

1312
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,920
He is family.

1313
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,180
You need to get, you need to get pet insurance.

1314
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,800
I do.

1315
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,100
I, I, I do.

1316
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:28,020
I realized like what the amount, like I didn't realize how much of a genetic freak he is, but now I, now I'm definitely getting pet insurance after that.

1317
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,140
Cause I have to do that for my cat.

1318
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:31,600
Yeah.

1319
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,620
I mean, you're, I mean, your cat is, what's it called?

1320
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,180
An incest baby.

1321
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,020
Yeah.

1322
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,920
Well, not for him.

1323
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,240
Oh, so I adopted the other cat.

1324
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,440
So I got her and like, she would like poop on the floor and there would be blood in it.

1325
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,660
Oh my God, what?

1326
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:50,760
Yeah.

1327
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,740
And so I took her to the vet and they were like, might be parasites.

1328
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,180
So kind of like monitor how her poop is like.

1329
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:58,540
Yeah.

1330
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,120
But still she will like poop on the floor and she just poops on the floor constantly.

1331
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,420
I'm always cleaning up her shit on the floor.

1332
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,380
And I'm like, I can't, I can't deal with this anymore.

1333
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,500
Oh my God.

1334
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:22,260
And she like, she has like problems going, I think it's still, I think like the parasites will go into remission and then like, they can't see them.

1335
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,760
And then, why can't they get rid of the parasites?

1336
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,520
Well, they are just like, we don't know for sure if she has them.

1337
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,700
So I've taken her back to the vet several times and I'm like, okay, I'm going to.

1338
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,500
I'm going to get peniturized.

1339
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,840
I'm going to get peniturized for her.

1340
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,200
Yeah.

1341
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,880
Cause she'll go to the bathroom in the litter box and then she'll be like, Nope, I got to go again.

1342
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:45,740
And then go on the floor.

1343
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,940
Just go next to the floor.

1344
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,040
Does she have to poop next to the litter?

1345
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,920
Yes, right next to the litter.

1346
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:52,500
Yeah.

1347
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,240
Oh my God.

1348
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh yeah.

1349
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,060
So yeah, like, oh yeah, that reminds me.

1350
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:05,360
So the issue right now is that they were like, yeah, like he's like peeing out like bits of his kidney.

1351
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,780
And I was like, what?

1352
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,260
Like, but like, no, it's not like actual kidney kidney.

1353
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,980
It's like, like when a kidney is like, seems to be a bit damaged, like you can pee it out apparently.

1354
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,800
And then they're like, yeah.

1355
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,720
So we're going to, we don't know.

1356
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,220
They're like, like, they're like, has your vet ever like said anything about that?

1357
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,660
And I was like, no, like that's new.

1358
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,400
Like, I was like, that was like the protein thing.

1359
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,380
So like, yeah.

1360
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,920
So I was like, that's new.

1361
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,420
Could that be like kidney stones?

1362
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,960
I have no idea.

1363
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,720
And, um, and so I was just, they're like, okay, so yeah.

1364
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:53,540
I mean, he seems okay right now, but like, uh, we're just going to do more tests to be like, what's going on?

1365
00:48:54,460 --> 00:49:00,880
And, um, yeah, so they're like, I think it could be like, they're like, I think it could be genetic wise.

1366
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,320
And I was like, how much of a freak are you?

1367
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,820
How old is he?

1368
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,680
He's, um, he's currently seven.

1369
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:09,820
Okay.

1370
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:10,360
Yeah.

1371
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,720
So, um.

1372
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,140
I don't know how long weenie dogs live for.

1373
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,600
Well, small dogs live a long, a lot longer than, uh, yeah, they live longer than big dogs.

1374
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,500
Um, but like, yeah, so, oh, they're just calling me again.

1375
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,080
I'll be back.

1376
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,080
Okay.

1377
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,520
Oh, seven.

1378
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,940
Cat pooping on the floor is usually a sign of an issue.

1379
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,720
Yeah, I know.

1380
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,860
That's why I have to take her back to the vet.

1381
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,500
I just haven't had time.

1382
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,380
And also it's like $500 a visit.

1383
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:02,580
So I'm like, I'm like, uh, like, obviously I'll do it, but I haven't had time recently.

1384
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,000
So, uh, uh, pets.

1385
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,180
Oh, pets.

1386
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,440
They're so expensive and they're so annoying.

1387
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,340
But they're, they are, they are, they are everything.

1388
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,500
But, well, that also cure pauses fart problems.

1389
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,120
I don't know.

1390
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:24,680
Maybe.

1391
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,580
I feel like it's all, it has to all be connected, though.

1392
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,140
I was like, I don't know if she has IBS or if it's parasites.

1393
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:39,560
Like, I've changed her food and a couple times and now she has a little bit more solid poops than she used.

1394
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,460
Like, it used to be straight liquid.

1395
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,000
Sorry if you're eating.

1396
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,920
But, you know, ask Nancy Drew.

1397
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,560
Yeah, pretty much.

1398
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,040
So, that's what I, worms, I say, worms, parasites, I mean them in the same way.

1399
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,140
But, like, I feel, she's had this ever since I got her.

1400
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:14,840
I feel like the shelter would have been like, hey, by the way, we tested her and they, she had something.

1401
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,360
And we treated it.

1402
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,960
Or we tested her and there was nothing.

1403
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:28,940
I don't know what, from the time we took her from the crate to my car, she suddenly got worms somehow.

1404
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,080
I don't know.

1405
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,340
Oh.

1406
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,000
Back again.

1407
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,140
I'm back again.

1408
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,180
Alright, so, yeah, they called me.

1409
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,440
They're like, we can't do the scan today because he ate too much.

1410
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,100
They're like, yeah, he ate too much.

1411
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,360
We can't sedate him.

1412
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,240
So, we're going to do it on Monday.

1413
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,120
That's okay.

1414
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,300
And I was like, yeah, that's fine.

1415
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,300
And they're like, oh, yeah, do you want to keep...

1416
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,880
Because he's staying at the pet hospital for another day.

1417
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,240
Just because I was like, you know, professionals.

1418
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,640
Are looking after him.

1419
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:06,320
Yeah.

1420
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,120
And they're like, oh, yeah, we could discharge him tomorrow if you want.

1421
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,780
Or keep him there.

1422
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,120
And I was like, we'll see...

1423
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,280
They're like, we'll see tomorrow how he's like.

1424
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,080
And then if tomorrow he's like, okay, we can discharge him.

1425
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,780
And then you bring him back on Monday.

1426
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,500
And then I was just like, no, just keep him there.

1427
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,360
Like, I was like, I didn't want to, like...

1428
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,140
I'm like, I don't want him to, like, come back and decide it.

1429
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,100
He'd be like, I'm going to show you a new symptom.

1430
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,520
Like, because, like, every day...

1431
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,900
Like, I was just like, I don't want to, like, deal with that.

1432
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,400
Because I don't want to...

1433
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,320
Yeah, I was like, he's already there.

1434
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,000
They're like, we'll talk about it more tomorrow.

1435
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,660
Because I was like, I'm okay if you keep him in the hospital for a few more days.

1436
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,340
Because I don't want to worry about a new symptom that shows up randomly.

1437
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,960
No, I guess that's fair.

1438
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,180
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1439
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,340
And it would stress him out, taking him back and forth.

1440
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,560
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.

1441
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,620
And then, like, at best, like, I could, like, visit him and stuff.

1442
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,060
Just so he'll be, like, more fine with, like, you know, have, like, familiar face.

1443
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,600
I think, like, that's the thing they're worried about.

1444
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,540
Because, like, you know, when they're like, where's my owner?

1445
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,560
And stuff like that.

1446
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:19,960
Yeah.

1447
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,180
But, like, I'm also really worried.

1448
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,600
Like, because, like, I'm worried that just another...

1449
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,280
Like, I think it was just a negative side...

1450
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,620
Because they're saying that it could be a negative side effect to all the fucking meds he's on right now.

1451
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,080
Yeah, I feel like that could be a normal case.

1452
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:45,440
Yeah, and then, like, because, like, there's, like, they said, like, one of the side effects from one of the medications he's taken is, like, it would upset the kidneys and the stomach in general.

1453
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,320
It was like, I don't know what they said.

1454
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,480
There's so many medical jargon.

1455
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,960
It was like, gastric something.

1456
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,440
And I was like, I totally understand.

1457
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,860
I was just like, yeah, yeah.

1458
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,220
I don't understand.

1459
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,880
But like, clearly, you know much better than me.

1460
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,200
Especially if it's a bunch of meds all at once.

1461
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:05,900
Yeah, yeah.

1462
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,780
He has to take four at once.

1463
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,560
So like, yeah, because like, he literally got back surgery.

1464
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,340
Yeah, so yeah, we're gonna see...

1465
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,460
But like, he's eating now.

1466
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,080
He's eating.

1467
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,180
He's drinking water now, which is great.

1468
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:26,000
And it's mostly just like, we're just trying to see, like, why he wasn't eating.

1469
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,940
And why he was getting diarrhea and vomiting.

1470
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,200
So obviously, that's more money.

1471
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,280
But like, it's okay.

1472
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,540
I have another sponsor next week.

1473
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,540
So it's okay.

1474
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:46,000
But thank you everybody for the super chats.

1475
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,440
I really, really appreciate it.

1476
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:55,320
I'm their sponsor next week, which is gonna help a lot.

1477
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,140
So all the sponsor money is going towards him right now.

1478
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,840
But yeah, that's a dog update right now.

1479
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,320
I mean, the vet said he's healthy.

1480
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,900
Like, not... Okay, I won't say healthy.

1481
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,580
But he's happy right now.

1482
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,800
He's not bad.

1483
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,120
He's just a little guy.

1484
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,100
He's just a little guy.

1485
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,160
They said that he's doing okay right now.

1486
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,120
And he's like, eating and drinking, which is...

1487
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,860
Yeah, stable.

1488
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,060
Yeah, he's stable.

1489
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:22,480
He's stable.

1490
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,700
Like, that was what we were worried about.

1491
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,420
Because like, last night, he wasn't eating until we gave him a half a hot dog.

1492
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,260
And then this morning, he didn't eat.

1493
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,480
But now he's eating now.

1494
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,380
So like, you know, that's already good.

1495
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,620
And that's good for me.

1496
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,220
Because it's like, look, he's eating.

1497
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,500
But also, if like, they discover something about...

1498
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,180
Like, from doing the test.

1499
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,120
Something else that he needs to be on medication for.

1500
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,480
It could have all been worth it.

1501
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:49,920
Like, say he was just upset from the meds.

1502
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,540
Like, but they also discovered that he had like the kidney thing.

1503
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,880
Like, that would be, you know, a good reason to also have everything done.

1504
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,640
So I wouldn't feel like, oh, he just was upset from the meds.

1505
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,740
Like, it's also good that if they...

1506
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:06,920
Yeah, they just found this, like the hidden disease that triggered it.

1507
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,120
He might have like something hidden in there.

1508
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,140
In there.

1509
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,460
Because they said like, oh, it's possible that he has something called this, this disease.

1510
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,460
I don't remember anymore.

1511
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,380
But they were like, it could be like this, this disease that he has.

1512
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,760
That could have been triggered by the medication.

1513
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,080
And it was like underlying.

1514
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,820
It was just like, you know, it wasn't that bad before.

1515
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,000
But because the medication triggered it, that's why he's vomiting and having diarrhea.

1516
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,800
And I was like, oh, that makes sense.

1517
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,140
It didn't make sense to me.

1518
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,880
But like, I was like, that makes sense.

1519
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,720
It does make sense.

1520
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,480
It does make sense.

1521
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,740
That makes sense.

1522
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,440
He's a messed up little guy.

1523
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,100
He's just a messed up genetic freak.

1524
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,120
But we love him.

1525
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,100
Yeah.

1526
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,620
He doesn't know that.

1527
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,280
As long as he lives his life knowing that he's not a messed up freak.

1528
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,800
Then it's okay.

1529
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,700
Okay, they're calling me again.

1530
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:51,920
Okay.

1531
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,500
Again?

1532
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,380
I was going to say, are they, I was literally about to ask, are they calling you?

1533
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,500
I was about to say, are they going to call her again?

1534
00:56:59,220 --> 00:56:59,580
Uh.

1535
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:01,700
Okay.

1536
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,020
Um.

1537
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,920
I was, because I was going to go get some water.

1538
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:12,460
Yeah.

1539
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,420
Yes, I understand.

1540
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,620
Doesn't understand at all.

1541
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,430
Say, Kate, it's you, PS.

1542
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,670
How many phone calls do you get?

1543
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,510
JK, guys.

1544
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:29,770
Just the UPS.

1545
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,330
It's not, it's not the vet.

1546
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:35,090
I, I, I lost track of phone calls.

1547
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,750
I was like, hello.

1548
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,470
And they're like, it's UPS.

1549
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:41,470
And I was like, oh.

1550
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,370
Turns off, turns off nice voice.

1551
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:46,870
Yeah, yeah.

1552
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,790
It's like, you know, the polite voice you use on phone calls.

1553
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,130
Hello?

1554
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:50,590
Hello?

1555
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:53,730
Oh, UPS.

1556
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:54,510
Oh, okay.

1557
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:55,830
I'll be like, okay.

1558
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:58,890
All right.

1559
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,270
Nah, nah, nothing.

1560
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,390
I was like, why did they call?

1561
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,670
I was like, oh my God, they call back so fast.

1562
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,330
What happened?

1563
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:05,670
I know what I was going to say.

1564
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,610
And then, it's just UPS.

1565
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,550
I'm going to go get water real quick.

1566
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:10,750
Okay.

1567
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,010
Maybe a snack.

1568
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,330
And you can keep playing the game.

1569
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,150
No, it's okay.

1570
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:15,370
I don't want you to miss out.

1571
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:16,770
I don't want you to miss out.

1572
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,290
I don't, yeah, no, I'll wait for you.

1573
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,190
I don't want you to miss out.

1574
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:22,830
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1575
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:23,810
It is an emergency.

1576
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:24,970
It's UPS, guys.

1577
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:26,810
I actually don't know what the delivery is.

1578
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,170
I have so many...

1579
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:28,750
Oh my gosh.

1580
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,570
Do I have anything coming today?

1581
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:31,670
I just...

1582
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:32,270
I don't know.

1583
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,490
I have so many delivery stuff coming over here.

1584
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,010
But like, some of them are like...

1585
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,530
Oh, it could be gamer subs.

1586
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,270
It's always...

1587
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,710
They always send me free stuff.

1588
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,050
I won't be surprised if it's just...

1589
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,370
If it's just more gamer subs things.

1590
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,850
Because they're always sending me free stuff.

1591
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:50,350
So...

1592
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,810
I was just like, what...

1593
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:54,830
What am I supposed to be getting during the UPS?

1594
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:56,370
And I was like, oh, yeah.

1595
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:03,010
Because like, if you're partnered with gamer subs, every month you get like a free package of like...

1596
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:07,090
Of like, you know, whatever they're releasing at that time.

1597
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:07,930
So...

1598
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,630
I think it was like every other month or something.

1599
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,010
They always give you...

1600
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,330
They always give you some...

1601
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,590
A free package of stuff.

1602
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:16,330
So...

1603
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:16,510
Yeah.

1604
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:17,710
I can't wait.

1605
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,210
I don't ever have to buy...

1606
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,870
Never have to buy...

1607
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:21,570
Use my code...

1608
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:26,530
By the way, you can use my code DokiBird for 15% off on all your purchases.

1609
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:28,210
Even on the mint stuff, too.

1610
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,630
Oh, it could be...

1611
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:30,250
No, it does.

1612
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:30,990
It's not mint stuff.

1613
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:31,670
Because like...

1614
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,110
It tells you me...

1615
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,030
It tells me what the free things are.

1616
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,650
Because I would get an email about it.

1617
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,790
And then it lists like all...

1618
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:39,470
Like the stuff there.

1619
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:42,010
And I remember it was not related to mint.

1620
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,450
It's like some other promotion that they're doing.

1621
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:45,910
But I don't remember.

1622
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,950
Use code DokiBird, by the way.

1623
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,610
But yes, thank you guys.

1624
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:53,490
Thank you all for the super chats.

1625
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,150
I thought you named yourself after the...

1626
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:57,250
No, I named the dog after me.

1627
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,690
I came first.

1628
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:02,450
I was there first.

1629
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,570
And then I named my dog after me.

1630
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,690
Because I'm an egomaniac.

1631
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,170
Let's play the game.

1632
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:09,670
Oh, hello.

1633
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,110
Yeah.

1634
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:11,110
I'll send them.

1635
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,690
I think the UPS package was a gamer subs package.

1636
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:15,750
Because they always send us free stuff.

1637
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:15,970
No way.

1638
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,970
I think so.

1639
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,510
Because I was like, what else am I getting?

1640
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:25,290
I was like, they always, they always, you know how they always send us free things every other month?

1641
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:26,170
Yeah.

1642
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:26,530
Yeah.

1643
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,530
So we have like a whole collection of like gamer subs stuff.

1644
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,190
So much.

1645
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,290
There's so much.

1646
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:40,330
Like, I have like, I have like, I have like a, like the, like, what is it called?

1647
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:44,670
Like a cabinet filled with just like the gamer subs powder.

1648
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,070
Like that's...

1649
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,570
Do you actually drink it?

1650
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,190
I actually do.

1651
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,730
When I'm like, instead of caffeine, I actually drink the, the powder.

1652
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:53,990
Because like, it's free.

1653
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:56,690
So I don't have to buy coffee, you know?

1654
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:00,190
Well, I'll make like pictures of it.

1655
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:01,850
Wait, you make pictures?

1656
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:02,390
What?

1657
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,970
Like, I have like, you know, like a pitcher of water.

1658
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,250
Like I make a pitcher of it.

1659
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:06,650
And then if I have a...

1660
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,350
Or you just put it in the fridge.

1661
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:08,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1662
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,210
That's smart.

1663
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:09,770
That's smart.

1664
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:10,950
I mean, it's free.

1665
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,550
So like, and there's like some natural...

1666
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:13,490
It's free.

1667
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,370
And you can get 15% off.

1668
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,410
It might not be free, but it's still 15% off.

1669
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,370
If you use code DokiBird on mince or on mince.

1670
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:25,390
Is it 15?

1671
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:26,610
Is that a 10 or 15?

1672
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:27,210
I don't know.

1673
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:27,990
I thought it was 10.

1674
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,210
Oh, is it 10%?

1675
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:29,970
Yeah.

1676
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,650
Typical Doki lying on the internet.

1677
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,530
You'll, you'll get 10% off of the order if you use Boomer.

1678
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,630
And it's not a lie.

1679
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:45,090
And you get 15% off on mince items that you use DokiBird to.

1680
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:45,890
No, it's 10.

1681
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,010
False advertising.

1682
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,030
Okay, now you're actually stalling.

1683
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:52,810
Let's play it again.

1684
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,510
Well, do you know what my UPS order is?

1685
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:56,710
No!

1686
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,830
Wait, are you actually waiting for that?

1687
01:01:58,850 --> 01:01:59,650
I don't know.

1688
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:01,550
I'm going to check outside right now.

1689
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,170
Give me a sec.

1690
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:03,970
Oh, my God!

1691
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,640
We're never going to finish this.

1692
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,500
It has become ultimate...

1693
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:12,980
We...

1694
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,080
I should have stopped her as soon as...

1695
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,900
The second...

1696
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,960
After the second phone call, I should have been like...

1697
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,960
This is it.

1698
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:19,680
We're going to...

1699
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,220
You didn't come up to my floor.

1700
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,180
So, I think...

1701
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:22,940
Oh, wait.

1702
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:23,820
They're calling me.

1703
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,700
Okay, never mind.

1704
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,500
Oh, my God!

1705
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,140
I was like, I got another phone call.

1706
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:30,340
You are screaming!

1707
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,060
You are working!

1708
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,320
I got another phone call!

1709
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,640
Wait, what did they call me?

1710
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,120
What did they call...

1711
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:41,540
Okay.

1712
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:42,520
I don't know.

1713
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,080
This is the most phone calls I've ever got during work.

1714
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm so popular.

1715
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,040
I'm so...

1716
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,360
I'm so popular, guys.

1717
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,520
Alright.

1718
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,060
Escape to resume.

1719
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,600
Alright.

1720
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:57,540
Where was I?

1721
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,040
Oh, here.

1722
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,780
Yeah, here.

1723
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,700
Open up.

1724
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,380
Knock, knock.

1725
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,100
Daddy's home.

1726
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,440
Daddy's here.

1727
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,100
Lucy.

1728
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,060
Lucy?

1729
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,700
I was watching something, and they referenced Lucy, and I was just like...

1730
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,800
I was like, no.

1731
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:17,960
I can't.

1732
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,020
I can't do this again.

1733
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,780
What am I supposed to do?

1734
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,980
I just walked forward?

1735
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,480
I guess so.

1736
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,780
I don't like this.

1737
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,060
Wait, there's something at the door.

1738
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:28,620
You see that?

1739
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,560
There's a face there.

1740
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,160
You see that face?

1741
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,140
You see that face?

1742
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,940
You stream in such low quality, I can't tell, actually.

1743
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,060
No, it's...

1744
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:37,520
Oh, wait.

1745
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:37,920
No, it's not.

1746
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:38,360
It's a door.

1747
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:39,380
Whoops.

1748
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,180
Oh, see?

1749
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,800
Okay, now you just need glasses.

1750
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,420
Okay, it looked like a face, though.

1751
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,480
Okay.

1752
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:46,020
I don't know about that.

1753
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,600
Okay, apparently I need to find a card, wherever that is.

1754
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,900
Oh, no.

1755
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,260
I have to explore it.

1756
01:03:59,320 --> 01:03:59,760
Okay.

1757
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,660
Time to explore.

1758
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,720
It's probably, like, right here.

1759
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,440
I don't know that.

1760
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,580
This game is never generous.

1761
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,980
Oh, my God.

1762
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,080
It's not a generous...

1763
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,800
Oh, you see that off-colored locker?

1764
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:14,720
Compared to...

1765
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,700
It definitely couldn't be...

1766
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,120
Oh, it's locked.

1767
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:16,780
Oh, it's locked.

1768
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,960
Okay, that's not cool.

1769
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,620
Oh, what about the...

1770
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,400
Oh, those are trees.

1771
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,800
I thought it was, like, blood on them.

1772
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,620
Okay, that's not cool.

1773
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:24,260
It's locked.

1774
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't like that.

1775
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,120
Okay.

1776
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,800
I don't like that.

1777
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,600
Keep looking around.

1778
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,340
Oh, there's a...

1779
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,600
See, there's another door.

1780
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,340
Yeah, there's another...

1781
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,600
I guess I have to go to that door and then go to the other side.

1782
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:37,720
Alright.

1783
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,100
Here I go.

1784
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,160
God, I wish I could just run.

1785
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,720
Like, did I just lose the use of my feet?

1786
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:47,920
Afterwards?

1787
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:48,740
You might have.

1788
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,520
Like, why can't I...

1789
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,920
Why can't I only, like, walk?

1790
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,620
Doesn't make sense.

1791
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,080
I don't know.

1792
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,320
He might be tired.

1793
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,920
Why are you so tired?

1794
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:02,600
Wake up, Dad.

1795
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,580
Wake up.

1796
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,060
Knock, knock.

1797
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,120
I don't like this.

1798
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,700
Wait, are we back at the hospital?

1799
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,720
Are we back in the hospital?

1800
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,140
Yeah.

1801
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,120
No way.

1802
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,620
Oh, we are.

1803
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,080
Wait, this is the hospital.

1804
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,160
Wait, no, it's just a cafeteria.

1805
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:17,580
Oh!

1806
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,280
Hey, who is Taylor?

1807
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:18,940
Who is Taylor?

1808
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:19,960
Who the heck is that?

1809
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,060
Who the fuck knows?

1810
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,900
Because that's the locker, right?

1811
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:26,300
Maybe.

1812
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:26,700
Probably.

1813
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:27,500
Oh.

1814
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,100
Ah!

1815
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:28,820
Ah!

1816
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:29,640
Ah!

1817
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:30,540
Turn on!

1818
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,540
Turn on!

1819
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,560
Oh my God!

1820
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,320
He's just walking towards me!

1821
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,720
Well, you're walking away, so it works.

1822
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,220
I don't think that's gonna work.

1823
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,260
Wait, I did it.

1824
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:43,800
Wait, it did.

1825
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,400
Oh my God.

1826
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:44,820
Oh my God.

1827
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,280
I thought you were gonna hide up there.

1828
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,000
No, I didn't know.

1829
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,240
Oh my God, he's leaving his footprints.

1830
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,500
Wait, there was a door on the other side.

1831
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,620
I don't know if he can get through this.

1832
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:51,820
No?

1833
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:52,880
I'll try.

1834
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,040
Oh, goodbye, I guess.

1835
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:55,480
Yeah.

1836
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,000
Wait, what if I loop him?

1837
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:58,600
Oh.

1838
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,120
Oh!

1839
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,680
Oh, I don't like that.

1840
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,440
So close.

1841
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:05,560
Ew!

1842
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:08,480
I don't like it.

1843
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,420
Oh my God, why would he look into my eyes while that happened?

1844
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,640
That was so...

1845
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,180
I don't like that.

1846
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,820
I don't like how he looked into my eyes as if there's, like, a connection there.

1847
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,080
Hopefully the autosave was when he picked up the key.

1848
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:24,580
Me too.

1849
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,780
I hope so, too.

1850
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,640
I hope so.

1851
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,260
I don't want to do all the videos again.

1852
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,860
No, and it can't be that far away.

1853
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:31,680
It is...

1854
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,140
Oh, yeah, it was very wet.

1855
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:35,480
Uh...

1856
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,740
Oh, it's back here, okay.

1857
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,380
Okay, just go up that side.

1858
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:38,660
Yeah.

1859
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
And then just pick up the key.

1860
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:40,980
Wait.

1861
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,940
Where do I go, then?

1862
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,320
There was a door on the other side.

1863
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:45,900
It was lit up.

1864
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:46,880
Oh.

1865
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,200
Wait, where?

1866
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,120
This one?

1867
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,380
No, no, no.

1868
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:52,780
No.

1869
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:54,140
Um...

1870
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:54,940
Oh, so...

1871
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,820
See that?

1872
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,880
It's dark right now.

1873
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,400
Right there.

1874
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,940
See, it's kind of lit up right now.

1875
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,360
That door over there, I'm pretty sure.

1876
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,100
Oh, the vent!

1877
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:03,520
No?

1878
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,440
I don't think so.

1879
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,700
See, there's that door right there.

1880
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,580
Can you not get to that?

1881
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,320
See?

1882
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,840
On the other side of the room!

1883
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:09,680
Can you not get to that?

1884
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,240
No.

1885
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:11,980
Oh.

1886
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:12,700
I think...

1887
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,440
Yeah, it's the vent.

1888
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:13,960
Yeah.

1889
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,040
Oh, you do go through the vent.

1890
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:15,380
Yeah.

1891
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,440
I was like...

1892
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,340
What door?

1893
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:20,220
It was lit up when I saw it, though.

1894
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:20,780
I swear.

1895
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,080
Sure it was.

1896
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,940
Someone didn't take her mitts!

1897
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,720
Wait, how do I...

1898
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,540
Oh.

1899
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,320
Okay, I have to, like...

1900
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,080
See him.

1901
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,420
You have to activate it, yeah.

1902
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,620
And be like...

1903
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:34,940
There's somebody here.

1904
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:36,600
Nope.

1905
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,080
Keep going.

1906
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,580
What the fuck?

1907
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,660
You have to go over there.

1908
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,740
The lights will flicker.

1909
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,100
Oh, okay.

1910
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:42,740
I see him.

1911
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:43,760
Alright.

1912
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:44,940
There's, like...

1913
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,940
There's no reason to go in there.

1914
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,040
And I was like...

1915
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,500
I can see it off the beach here.

1916
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:49,620
Why not?

1917
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:50,360
I know.

1918
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,240
I was like, why not?

1919
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,700
He's literally right there.

1920
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,700
God, like...

1921
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,200
Wow.

1922
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,280
That's so smooth.

1923
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:57,800
Vent time.

1924
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,640
Surely nothing's gonna chase me in the vents, right?

1925
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:02,720
No.

1926
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:03,580
Wait.

1927
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,540
Can you activate your lighter?

1928
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,680
Is that why there's black mold?

1929
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,380
Because of the vents?

1930
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:08,900
No.

1931
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,300
Because of the tar, man.

1932
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,060
Because of the mold, man.

1933
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,260
No, he's obviously tar.

1934
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,440
That's not mold.

1935
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:18,460
Okay.

1936
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,560
But, like...

1937
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,240
That means there's tar on my...

1938
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,120
On my ceiling.

1939
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,980
What is he?

1940
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:25,660
Spider-Man?

1941
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,060
It's Venom.

1942
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,320
It's pre...

1943
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,340
Venom has taken another host.

1944
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,340
It's because he's not...

1945
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,780
It's because it's not Tom Hardy.

1946
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,780
It's, like, some regular guy.

1947
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,140
What if he's still chasing after you?

1948
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,020
Don't say that.

1949
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,260
Don't say that.

1950
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,160
I'm looking backwards.

1951
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,640
It only makes the game longer.

1952
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:50,720
All right.

1953
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,160
Time to take the locker.

1954
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:57,860
All right.

1955
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:58,960
Open up.

1956
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,020
Oh, there's the key card.

1957
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:01,240
Oh.

1958
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,400
I don't even know how to read that.

1959
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,560
He's, he's, he's, like...

1960
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,280
I feel like this room is perfect for looping.

1961
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,260
He's gonna be right there.

1962
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,000
Don't say that.

1963
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:08,860
He's gonna...

1964
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,760
No, he's not.

1965
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:10,500
Yeah.

1966
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,260
I'm gonna have a perfect escape right here at the bottom of the stairs.

1967
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:18,260
And there's gonna be no one waiting for me.

1968
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:19,480
Can you jump in this game?

1969
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:19,940
No.

1970
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:23,000
I can flick my lighter back and forth.

1971
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,340
It's just like that.

1972
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:26,740
Beep, beep.

1973
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:27,340
Beep, beep.

1974
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:27,900
Oh.

1975
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:28,780
Oh.

1976
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:29,420
Oh, he's gonna come.

1977
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,160
And I open the door.

1978
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:34,780
And then I close the door behind me.

1979
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:36,520
Oh.

1980
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,280
Oh, okay.

1981
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:37,960
Okay.

1982
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,760
The music was so ominous.

1983
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,900
It's like, door open.

1984
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:44,780
Oh.

1985
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:45,740
Whoa.

1986
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,980
Oh, that's a lot of tar.

1987
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:49,600
I mean...

1988
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,620
I wonder if this is all the pieces we have to get.

1989
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,180
Like, see how they're all branched.

1990
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,640
Oh, that's true.

1991
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,300
No, actually, this is from the vision, though.

1992
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,600
This is from the tape, I mean.

1993
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,820
Oh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the well.

1994
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,820
The well, yeah.

1995
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,380
I'm gonna take the apple.

1996
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:04,840
From the snake.

1997
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:05,700
Oh, don't do it, Eve!

1998
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,860
I'm gonna do it.

1999
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,260
Oh, I...

2000
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:08,440
Snake?

2001
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,460
Gladly.

2002
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,680
Something gonna...

2003
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,020
And then the ring girl's gonna pop up.

2004
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,980
And be like, send this to five different people.

2005
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,260
Send this playthrough to five different people.

2006
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,800
Or Doe Kitty.

2007
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:30,940
That's a fat apple.

2008
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,140
And Mink Kitty is gonna pop out of your screen.

2009
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,160
Mink Kitty.

2010
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,400
Oh.

2011
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,000
Oh.

2012
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,020
That's a juicy apple right there.

2013
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:40,480
Yeah, yeah.

2014
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,220
Oh, yum, yum, yum.

2015
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,260
Eat it.

2016
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:43,960
Oh, oh.

2017
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:44,440
Eat that.

2018
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,800
That's what happens when he...

2019
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,080
Oh.

2020
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,140
Oh, no.

2021
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,600
I feel like something's gonna come out.

2022
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:53,480
Do a flip.

2023
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,660
Jump in.

2024
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,700
Come on, you know you want to.

2025
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:00,560
Am I not gonna jump in?

2026
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,320
Am I a coward?

2027
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,500
I can't control it.

2028
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:08,160
I know this is probably all symbolism, but I have no idea what's happening.

2029
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:09,940
What's going on?

2030
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,440
Oh, somebody's gonna come up and grab me.

2031
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,580
I'm gonna touch the water?

2032
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:18,120
What's wrong with me?

2033
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,540
He's thirsty.

2034
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,080
Oh my god.

2035
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,280
What the fuck?

2036
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,780
What's going on?

2037
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:29,300
What?

2038
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:30,580
Ass up.

2039
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:35,320
Join us.

2040
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,240
Oh, look at all these asses.

2041
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,580
Oh, that one's so perky.

2042
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,280
You see that perky one over there?

2043
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,140
Oh, yeah.

2044
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,540
Yeah, with the extra shine.

2045
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,080
Extra shine.

2046
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,280
They're all assed up, except the first guy.

2047
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,120
He's shy.

2048
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,560
He's really shy.

2049
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,080
He's like, you gotta work for this.

2050
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:57,960
Oh.

2051
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,120
Oh, my god.

2052
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,180
Oh, my god, there's tar guy.

2053
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,840
I don't like it.

2054
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:08,820
Solid snake ass drink.

2055
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,240
Snake.

2056
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,080
Snake.

2057
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:12,520
Snake.

2058
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,560
I was promised a woman coming out of the well.

2059
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:22,840
What is this?

2060
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:23,440
Yeah.

2061
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:24,540
What happened?

2062
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,120
My Japanese whore lied to me.

2063
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:27,640
Yeah.

2064
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,680
You remember when they did, like, the ring girl versus...

2065
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,840
Oh, my god.

2066
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:33,700
Yes.

2067
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,800
I thought that movie was so bad.

2068
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,100
You watched it?

2069
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,400
I love the ads for it.

2070
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,040
The ads for it were really funny.

2071
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,140
So, like, there's a lot in the ring.

2072
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:51,140
Um, novel that they did not add it, like, adapt into the movie.

2073
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,180
Like, it's very...

2074
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:56,040
The ring is actually really, really weird.

2075
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,160
And, like, in the movie, in the, in the, um...

2076
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,160
In the versus movie, they kind of...

2077
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:02,860
What are you...

2078
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:03,500
Oh, you're saving?

2079
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,200
Yeah, they said I can't automatically save, so I got scared.

2080
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,080
Okay.

2081
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,140
I think that was a checkpoint.

2082
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:11,460
But, um...

2083
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,920
There's, like, some things that they did adapt for the movie that they didn't, like...

2084
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,980
From the novel that they did for that movie.

2085
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,180
And it's, like, she grows, like, frog legs.

2086
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,060
There's, like, a frog version of her.

2087
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,320
And, like...

2088
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,560
It's just very strange.

2089
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:26,840
It's...

2090
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:28,400
It's...

2091
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,200
There's a lot that is not in the movies.

2092
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,720
Okay, where do I go now?

2093
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,240
She grows...

2094
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,500
Wait, so you read that book?

2095
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,780
No, I didn't read the book, but, like, I read about the book.

2096
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,460
Oh, there's a collectible in there.

2097
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,060
Oh, we don't need that.

2098
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,120
No, that's definitely where the Tired Man comes out.

2099
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:48,780
That's...

2100
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,840
That's definitely where...

2101
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,600
Okay, so where do we go for the next, uh...

2102
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,340
For the next one?

2103
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,840
Remember the one with, like...

2104
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,800
It was Greed, right?

2105
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:57,360
Yeah.

2106
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,240
Or was it Affliction?

2107
01:13:59,240 --> 01:13:59,960
I don't know.

2108
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,440
We just did Affliction.

2109
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:01,960
Okay.

2110
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,180
So where do we get for Greed?

2111
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:05,480
Hold on.

2112
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,140
One moment.

2113
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,740
The Greed was at the top.

2114
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:13,140
Okay.

2115
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,000
After...

2116
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,840
Notice how the tape shows the inside of a vent.

2117
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:18,700
Yeah, we saw that.

2118
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,000
Go down to the basement.

2119
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:20,900
Boiler room.

2120
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:21,420
Okay.

2121
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,180
Wait, that...

2122
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:22,620
Oh!

2123
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,280
Okay.

2124
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:24,880
Yeah, we're right there, actually.

2125
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,980
Where was the boiler room?

2126
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:27,400
Nope, turn around.

2127
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:28,060
Turn around.

2128
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,440
We're right there.

2129
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:29,980
To the left.

2130
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,840
There we go.

2131
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:34,760
And...

2132
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,460
Oh, I don't know.

2133
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,120
I think that's it.

2134
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:36,740
Oh.

2135
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:37,860
Like, no, no.

2136
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:38,680
Wait.

2137
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:39,340
No, no, no.

2138
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,240
There it is.

2139
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,020
Oh, yeah.

2140
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,860
Sorry, I thought it was the hole in the boiler.

2141
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:44,740
No, no, no.

2142
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,220
I was like...

2143
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,620
I thought it was the hole in the boiler.

2144
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,160
Oh, I hurt myself.

2145
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,500
I'm a pathetic man.

2146
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,360
Yeah, you are.

2147
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,960
How did my weight...

2148
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,240
Broke it?

2149
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,780
Sorry, I had ice cream today.

2150
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,560
I hurt myself today.

2151
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:02,900
Okay.

2152
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:03,960
All right.

2153
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:05,400
Okay.

2154
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,920
Wait, um, you need that stepladder.

2155
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,980
You need the stepladder.

2156
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:08,700
I broke the stepladder.

2157
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,460
Like, I don't know.

2158
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,300
We can fix it.

2159
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,520
Wait, no way.

2160
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:13,680
What did you saw?

2161
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,240
There was a...

2162
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:14,580
Oh.

2163
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:15,600
Oh my god, it was my lighter.

2164
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,020
My lighter, like, ran at me.

2165
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:20,660
Okay.

2166
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

2167
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,580
We have to find a new stepladder.

2168
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,420
Okay, where's the deuce stepladder?

2169
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,520
I don't know.

2170
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,060
Look around.

2171
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,000
What do you mean, look around?

2172
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:29,700
It's in the basement.

2173
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:30,440
It's in the basement.

2174
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,700
But where in the basement?

2175
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,420
Oh my god.

2176
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,120
You are not a very helpful...

2177
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,140
You're not getting a tip for this guide work.

2178
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,120
I was gonna get tipped?

2179
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:44,560
Yeah, you know how, like, tour guides get, like, tips for doing a good job?

2180
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,840
Someone that was definitely not doing a good job.

2181
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,560
Well, you weren't going to tip me regardless, so...

2182
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,360
I could have!

2183
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,660
I could have Akasuped you on your channel.

2184
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:53,260
You wouldn't.

2185
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:53,800
No, you wouldn't.

2186
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:54,380
Yes, I would have.

2187
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,380
No, you wouldn't have.

2188
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,220
No, you wouldn't have.

2189
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,020
I would have.

2190
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:58,020
I would have.

2191
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,320
I'm a very generous person.

2192
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:00,860
Oh, there he is.

2193
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,840
See, I didn't need your help.

2194
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,720
We'll need your help later.

2195
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,340
Oops.

2196
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:11,940
Oh my god.

2197
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:14,960
Just close the door.

2198
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:15,440
Oh my god!

2199
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:16,800
Okay.

2200
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:17,380
No!

2201
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,460
Just drop it.

2202
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,440
Okay, I need to drop.

2203
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:22,680
Oh my god, I hate...

2204
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,160
I hate all these controls.

2205
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:25,000
Ew, it's like talking.

2206
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,780
It's creepy.

2207
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:27,480
Ew!

2208
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,320
I'm trying to grab...

2209
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,780
I don't want to hear the baby anymore.

2210
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,680
You're gonna hear this baby.

2211
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,680
You're gonna hear the baby.

2212
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,060
The baby.

2213
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:38,780
The baby.

2214
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,100
The baby.

2215
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,480
Alright, now I can...

2216
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,800
Now you can do it.

2217
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:45,160
Alright.

2218
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,380
The baby.

2219
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,240
The baby.

2220
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,220
Is there a...

2221
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,180
I hear a woof.

2222
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,860
Is that a dog on your end?

2223
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,400
Yeah, there's a dog on your end.

2224
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,720
Oh my god, it's like...

2225
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,180
It's like...

2226
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,480
Who's barking right now?

2227
01:16:59,060 --> 01:16:59,580
Alright.

2228
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,020
Someone's probably walking their dog.

2229
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:01,420
Woof!

2230
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:01,940
Woof!

2231
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:04,380
Alright.

2232
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,740
I'm just gonna go straight until I can.

2233
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,660
I assume I have to go straight until...

2234
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,740
It tells me to stop.

2235
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,280
Yeah, probably.

2236
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,420
Wait, how many tapes were there?

2237
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,240
Seven?

2238
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:20,320
Oh my god.

2239
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:21,300
But that...

2240
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,360
They're like mini chapters.

2241
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:23,620
That one was so...

2242
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,500
That wasn't so fast.

2243
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,300
Oh my god.

2244
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:28,360
It just took a long time because you got five calls in the middle of it.

2245
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:28,780
That's true.

2246
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:31,360
I'm a very important person, apparently.

2247
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,280
You don't give a fuck.

2248
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:34,820
Wait, actually, I don't want to sign a contract.

2249
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:35,560
Let me read...

2250
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:35,920
You're gonna sign that?

2251
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,540
I'm never doing that again.

2252
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,120
What does this mean?

2253
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,500
Yeah, I would like to please have a lawyer read this.

2254
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:46,060
Please.

2255
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,340
Wait, you're...

2256
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,180
The bird is there.

2257
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:53,860
Yeah, I know.

2258
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:54,700
Wait, it's you.

2259
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:55,240
It's me.

2260
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,360
They're like signing the contract.

2261
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:57,240
Sign.

2262
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,620
You know, you want to sign it.

2263
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,220
Sign it.

2264
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:02,460
From one bird to another.

2265
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:03,220
Yeah.

2266
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,080
Yeah.

2267
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,080
Okay, I guess I'll sign the contract.

2268
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,560
I gotta do a part of my soul.

2269
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,060
It just says you don't give a fuck like eight times.

2270
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,820
Oh, it does underneath it too?

2271
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,220
Okay.

2272
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:17,560
Yeah.

2273
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,140
So edgy.

2274
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:19,680
Whoa.

2275
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,540
Yeah, it's time to sign.

2276
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:22,840
What are we...

2277
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,000
What does that mean, though?

2278
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:25,940
Should we just stop giving a fuck?

2279
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,760
If we give a fuck, then we...

2280
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,600
We break the contract.

2281
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:32,880
We break the contract.

2282
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,400
They're like, you did it.

2283
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,060
Yippee!

2284
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,940
You signed the contract.

2285
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:39,220
Oh.

2286
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:40,060
Oh.

2287
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,280
Oh.

2288
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,060
Oh.

2289
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,820
I signed the contract.

2290
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,940
They also signed the contract.

2291
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,080
Can you use your lighter?

2292
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,160
I don't think I can.

2293
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,400
I think we'll have to do that thing where...

2294
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:55,040
We're like, where we can't...

2295
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:55,940
In the hospital?

2296
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:56,520
Yeah.

2297
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,600
Wait, do I have to like, go between them?

2298
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,800
Like, I can't touch them at all?

2299
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,720
Like, is there a hole?

2300
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,040
There's a hole.

2301
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:08,820
There's a goal.

2302
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,300
Ooh.

2303
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:11,620
Wow!

2304
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:12,360
Whee!

2305
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,920
The bakery!

2306
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:16,860
Wow.

2307
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:17,680
Ooh.

2308
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,020
Ooh wee.

2309
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:21,860
Oh.

2310
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:22,700
They're speaking.

2311
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,200
A little maze.

2312
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:23,920
They're speaking in tongues.

2313
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,520
Wait, you're not...

2314
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,380
There's tons of holes.

2315
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,380
Why aren't you going through them?

2316
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:27,820
Oh.

2317
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:29,620
There we go.

2318
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:30,020
Oh my god.

2319
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:30,880
That's a dead bird.

2320
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,800
I don't give a fuck.

2321
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,100
Oh, there's a masterpiece on top of the dead bird.

2322
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,520
A what?

2323
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,460
Oh, yeah.

2324
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:39,040
It's a...

2325
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,140
The Phantom of the Opera.

2326
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,080
Da da da da da da.

2327
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,340
Was that it?

2328
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,220
I think so.

2329
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,460
And then they're angry.

2330
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,780
They're like, you took the mask.

2331
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,940
You disturbed the Phantom.

2332
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,140
And then they're going to burn down the theater.

2333
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,180
Oh, yeah.

2334
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:03,640
That's Lucy.

2335
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:04,580
Is that Lucy's bird?

2336
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:04,980
No.

2337
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,140
Lucy's bird was...

2338
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:06,820
Was it?

2339
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,640
I don't remember.

2340
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,060
I don't remember either.

2341
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:09,440
Oh.

2342
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,540
We're back in the chair.

2343
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:11,900
Okay.

2344
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,460
Now we can watch more videotapes.

2345
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:14,400
All right.

2346
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,040
Time to go back.

2347
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:17,060
Wait.

2348
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,560
There was one you put in.

2349
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,360
Yeah?

2350
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,660
I don't remember which one it was.

2351
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:22,940
Wait.

2352
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:23,800
How did I get crazy?

2353
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:24,180
Oh.

2354
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:24,800
The door.

2355
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:28,600
The bad thing is that I actually don't have any more...

2356
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:31,260
I don't have any more meds.

2357
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,440
So I'm forever going little cuckoo.

2358
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:34,680
Well, there's a candle right there.

2359
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,060
Yeah.

2360
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,340
But it doesn't raise my sanity.

2361
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,820
It just makes it so my sanity doesn't go down.

2362
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,660
Doesn't go down.

2363
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,080
Yeah.

2364
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:40,620
Okay.

2365
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,780
I think you raised your sanity in the light though.

2366
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:43,500
Do I?

2367
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:44,900
I think so.

2368
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:45,800
Like it's gone now.

2369
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:46,180
Yeah.

2370
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:46,820
But it just...

2371
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:48,520
It's there to remind me that...

2372
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,680
Oh, it does raise my sanity.

2373
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:50,660
Oh, it heals me.

2374
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:51,960
Oh, okay.

2375
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,020
Wait.

2376
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:53,720
You're in the light.

2377
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,400
Don't leave.

2378
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,760
No, I'm just standing next to my candle.

2379
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,820
So I can be a little more sane.

2380
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,140
I gotta buy myself some scented candles.

2381
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,260
All right.

2382
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,800
Let's get the...

2383
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,700
Prison.

2384
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,240
And then pride.

2385
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:07,860
Prison pride.

2386
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:08,780
All right.

2387
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,040
I don't think we should have pride.

2388
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,680
Prison pride.

2389
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,220
Prison pride.

2390
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:15,540
Prison pride.

2391
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,160
Prison pride.

2392
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:17,240
Prison pride.

2393
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,420
Especially when it's privatized.

2394
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:23,900
All right.

2395
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:24,760
PP.

2396
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:26,960
Oh.

2397
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:28,760
We'll do pride first.

2398
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,440
Oh, no.

2399
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,380
That's a hammer.

2400
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:31,200
Wait.

2401
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:31,920
Which one's this one?

2402
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:32,780
Pride or prison?

2403
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:34,640
Prison.

2404
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:40,270
All right.

2405
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:41,190
Hold on.

2406
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,310
Oh, I don't like that.

2407
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:43,710
Ooh.

2408
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,530
Oh.

2409
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:46,670
The children yearn for the mines.

2410
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,290
That's what you've always wanted.

2411
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:51,770
To the mines we go.

2412
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,130
All children want to go in the mines.

2413
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:55,930
Okay.

2414
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:57,490
So, that's the basement.

2415
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:58,730
All right.

2416
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:01,670
And then...

2417
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:03,090
That has to be downstairs again.

2418
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:05,910
And then...

2419
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:06,930
We gotta have a hammer.

2420
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:07,730
I'm pretty sure.

2421
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,170
Yeah.

2422
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:08,690
Probably.

2423
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:09,550
All right.

2424
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:10,210
Pride time.

2425
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,830
Pride time.

2426
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:12,090
Woo!

2427
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,850
First we mined, then we craft.

2428
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:16,550
Did you see that they were doing, like, a...

2429
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:19,110
The meme edition for the movie watch-alongs?

2430
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:21,730
They're allowing people to, like, go crazy.

2431
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:22,270
Yeah.

2432
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:23,390
I don't think the...

2433
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:25,710
The theater employees are gonna be paid more, though.

2434
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:29,850
I feel like all they have to do is toast it outside.

2435
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:31,330
I think so, too.

2436
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:31,950
Yeah.

2437
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,270
Just have it in, like, an open field.

2438
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,170
People can mosh.

2439
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:37,050
It'll be fine.

2440
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:37,890
Oh, my God.

2441
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:38,750
A mosh pit?

2442
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:41,510
Where, like, the chicken...

2443
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:43,950
The lava chicken song comes in.

2444
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:44,990
They just start moshing.

2445
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:47,430
It'll be awesome.

2446
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,490
The pen lights, I have no idea.

2447
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:51,290
It's, like, a...

2448
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:53,170
Like, a...

2449
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:54,670
Attic or a basement or something.

2450
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:58,330
And then, like, they throw the pen lights out and start doing the...

2451
01:22:58,330 --> 01:22:58,930
What is it called?

2452
01:22:59,310 --> 01:22:59,770
The...

2453
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:01,630
The little pen light dance that...

2454
01:23:01,630 --> 01:23:02,190
Watergate?

2455
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:02,530
Yeah.

2456
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:04,830
They start doing Watergate to, like, lava chicken.

2457
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:08,930
I...

2458
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,410
Lava chicken.

2459
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,650
Oh, what the fuck is that?

2460
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,130
Oh, it's back in the hospital.

2461
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:19,790
That's the hospital.

2462
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:20,430
Yeah.

2463
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,190
That's the hospital again.

2464
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:25,290
Yippee!

2465
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:25,970
Yippee!

2466
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:27,550
We left the hospital.

2467
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:28,230
Yippee!

2468
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:30,190
No, did you hear the guy in the video?

2469
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:31,070
He went, yippee!

2470
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:34,270
Oh, okay.

2471
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:35,130
That's the end of...

2472
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:35,350
All right.

2473
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:36,050
So, where is that?

2474
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:38,590
Where's Pride in prison?

2475
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,670
Um...

2476
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,010
Well, prison, we gotta go back to the basement, like you said.

2477
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,690
What about Pride?

2478
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:46,930
Is it also in the basement?

2479
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:49,250
We might as well know if it's in the basement or not.

2480
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,410
I'm tired of going in the basement.

2481
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:54,210
I'm tired of the basement.

2482
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,790
I'll be where Jesus Christ is.

2483
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:59,770
Oh, actually, Pride is the one that was...

2484
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,190
So, that must be the first one you played.

2485
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:04,030
Because it's the one that's on the, um...

2486
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:04,590
Where is it?

2487
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:05,790
The door, right...

2488
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,110
The table, right outside this door.

2489
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:09,310
Like the...

2490
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:09,810
That one?

2491
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:10,450
By the front door.

2492
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:11,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2493
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:11,490
That's Pride?

2494
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:12,510
Yeah, yeah.

2495
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:13,650
Oh!

2496
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:15,690
Okay, then we'll do prison.

2497
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:19,530
You wanna go to the basement first?

2498
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:23,510
Wait, that's the key to the...

2499
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:25,250
That's the key?

2500
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:26,530
I mean, like, we can do that whenever.

2501
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:27,790
Because it's literally right there.

2502
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:28,890
You know?

2503
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:29,250
Okay.

2504
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,250
Yeah, then do...

2505
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:30,930
Then do prison first.

2506
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:31,370
Yeah, yeah.

2507
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:32,570
I'll just take the video out for now.

2508
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,110
Are you sure?

2509
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,230
Are you sure that's the...

2510
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:40,350
That's the, uh...

2511
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,150
Are you sure that's for the...

2512
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:42,830
The Pride?

2513
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:45,730
Are you reading it correctly?

2514
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:46,650
Are you...

2515
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:47,990
That's what he's telling me!

2516
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:49,390
Oh.

2517
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:50,390
The TV turned back.

2518
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:51,230
Oh, I'm getting crazy.

2519
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:51,670
Don't worry.

2520
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:52,550
I have my candle here.

2521
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:53,070
Oh!

2522
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:54,610
The candle can burn out!

2523
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:55,050
Oh!

2524
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,210
That makes a lot of sense.

2525
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:58,310
Yeah, that's how...

2526
01:24:58,310 --> 01:24:58,870
That's how candles are.

2527
01:24:58,870 --> 01:24:59,470
That's...

2528
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:00,210
Okay, Min.

2529
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:00,930
I'm sorry.

2530
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,870
But I need a pee.

2531
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,910
I didn't get to pee.

2532
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:08,810
I didn't get to pee.

2533
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,910
I'll be right back.

2534
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:14,580
Guys?

2535
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,780
Guys, what?

2536
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:18,420
What?

2537
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,500
What is happening?

2538
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,700
How long have we been streaming for?

2539
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,000
Over an hour and a...

2540
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,540
What?

2541
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,620
Almost an hour and a half!

2542
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,800
Oh, my God.

2543
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:31,700
Please understand.

2544
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,440
I don't...

2545
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,480
I don't understand.

2546
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:34,860
Yeah.

2547
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:35,960
Send all those...

2548
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,560
We were talking about how funny we think these ones are.

2549
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,780
The...

2550
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,520
The anger...

2551
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,340
Angry, angry, angry.

2552
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,180
Doki was like, I want to get one made...

2553
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,120
Of that emote.

2554
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,100
Because it's so funny.

2555
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,240
Feels more like a minstream now.

2556
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:51,740
I am!

2557
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,080
What would she do without me, huh?

2558
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,280
What would she do without me?

2559
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,840
I'm holding down the fort here.

2560
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,040
I went to get...

2561
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,140
I went to get a drink.

2562
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:00,960
And a snack.

2563
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:02,140
And...

2564
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:03,780
I'm holding down the fort here.

2565
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,780
Oh, my God.

2566
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:11,190
Very relatable face.

2567
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:11,990
It's kind of creepy.

2568
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:13,110
But I don't hate it.

2569
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:15,170
Oh, my gosh.

2570
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,630
You know...

2571
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:17,290
Have you guys ever heard of labubus?

2572
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:20,550
They're like a really big thing right now.

2573
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:22,610
Like, you know how blind boxes are huge?

2574
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:23,550
And...

2575
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:25,110
I keep seeing people being like...

2576
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,090
I hate labubus.

2577
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:26,950
They're so ugly.

2578
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:29,570
But I think they're kind of cute.

2579
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:32,110
They remind me of where the wild things are.

2580
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:33,510
So I like them.

2581
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:34,430
The what?

2582
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:35,250
Labubu.

2583
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:37,030
Labubu.

2584
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:38,550
Labubu.

2585
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:39,230
I kind of...

2586
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,050
I like them.

2587
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:42,170
And I want to, like, get one.

2588
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:43,770
But apparently, it's like...

2589
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:46,530
You know how people are going insane over Pokemon cards?

2590
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:48,970
People are going insane over these little plushies.

2591
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:52,390
So they're little plush doll keychains of, like...

2592
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:55,970
They look like gremlin creature monsters.

2593
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:59,910
They have these ugly faces and these big old spiky teeth and everything.

2594
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:01,610
Yeah, they're super expensive.

2595
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:04,250
Only because people are scalping them.

2596
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,690
Wait, scalping what?

2597
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:07,570
Have you heard of labubus?

2598
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:08,310
Oh, yeah.

2599
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:09,670
I was going to talk about labubus.

2600
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:09,950
Yeah.

2601
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:11,250
They're like such a craze.

2602
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:12,570
I heard about it.

2603
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:14,350
It's like they came out of nowhere.

2604
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:17,550
I've not known where I've been seeing them for around for like a year plus now.

2605
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:20,690
But, like, recently they got so fucking popular.

2606
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:21,670
I know.

2607
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:25,590
That's because the West is behind on...

2608
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,170
On the labubu craze now.

2609
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,830
Yeah, because, like, it's been in Asia for a long time.

2610
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:30,750
Yeah, yeah.

2611
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:34,910
And then, like, now it's because I've seen them for like, what, two years?

2612
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,190
I think like one or two years ago.

2613
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:38,030
So I was like really surprised.

2614
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,490
I think they're so cute.

2615
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,350
But, like, and I want one.

2616
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:45,370
But I don't want people to be like, oh, she's a labubu girly.

2617
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:50,510
I literally see so many YouTube shorts above, like...

2618
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:50,570
Yeah.

2619
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:54,230
I mean, I saw, like, they're cute.

2620
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:54,770
They're cute.

2621
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:56,690
But, like, I find it funny that now...

2622
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:58,050
I guess, like, they hit their...

2623
01:27:58,050 --> 01:28:02,710
Like, they're now, like, a trend or fad now because of all the YouTube shorts and TikToks about it.

2624
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:05,090
So everybody's, like, crazy about it.

2625
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:05,890
I'm a hipster.

2626
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:08,670
I don't want people to be like, oh, she's into labubus.

2627
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,650
But it's also, like, it's...

2628
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:14,790
Like, people are going so crazy that it, like, it feels like I would be embarrassed to have one.

2629
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:19,510
Because, like, people are, like, constantly refreshing, like, the website.

2630
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,210
Yeah, yeah.

2631
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:24,370
When I was, like, when I was, like, out, like, you know, when I used...

2632
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:31,710
When I went outside for once in my life, other than for my dog, I went to, like, this mall and I went to, like, grab dinner.

2633
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:36,470
And then, like, there were, like, there was, like, two tables in my front that were just talking about labubus.

2634
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:38,090
And they're, like, oh, my God.

2635
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:39,710
I just got, like, the new labubus.

2636
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,550
Like, oh, my God.

2637
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:42,770
There's a labubu girl right in front of me.

2638
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:43,510
There's...

2639
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:45,450
I know.

2640
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,050
They're in the wild.

2641
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:47,710
They are.

2642
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:48,530
They're really cute.

2643
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:49,090
I just...

2644
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:55,290
I think, like, the community around it is a little bit really fanatic.

2645
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:55,790
It's...

2646
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:56,550
Oh, yeah.

2647
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:58,210
That's why I don't want to...

2648
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:02,870
But also, people, if you have, like, a labubu that somebody wants, people will steal it off.

2649
01:29:02,890 --> 01:29:03,830
Wait, really?

2650
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:04,550
Yeah.

2651
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:06,030
That's crazy.

2652
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:12,710
So I'm just, like, if I get a labubu and then someone steals it, I'll have spent so much money on it.

2653
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:12,990
Yeah.

2654
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:16,230
And I heard, like, there's, like, there's, like, ways to find...

2655
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:18,210
They're, like, this is how you find a fake labubu.

2656
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:19,810
And there's apparently, like, um...

2657
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:21,130
Oh, those are the lafufus.

2658
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:22,110
The lafufus.

2659
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:23,070
The lafufus.

2660
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,030
Yeah, it was a...

2661
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:25,530
Yeah.

2662
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,130
Like, it's called a lafufu.

2663
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2664
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:32,330
Okay, that's funny.

2665
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:35,610
Oh, my God.

2666
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:36,510
All right, let's play a game.

2667
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:37,610
It was gamersups.

2668
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:39,090
Oh, okay.

2669
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:40,170
There you go.

2670
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:41,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2671
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,310
Yeah, so that was what the UPS package was.

2672
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:45,490
All right, let me hydrate real quick.

2673
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:46,850
LaBooBoo.

2674
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:49,670
It's really cool, though, how they...

2675
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:51,250
Did you see how they made it?

2676
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,070
So there's, like, apparently the official...

2677
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,930
Okay, this is my last solid topic, because it's part of your topic.

2678
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:56,830
Okay.

2679
01:29:57,370 --> 01:30:04,390
But, like, LaBooBoo's, they have, like, this special website designed to, like, help people figure out if they're fake or not.

2680
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:05,230
Oh.

2681
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:12,830
And apparently, like, in the LaBooBoo packaging, they would have, like, a special card or whatever to scan.

2682
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:13,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2683
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:16,610
Yeah, like, a special QR card just for, like, that particular doll.

2684
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:19,390
So, like, each doll has their own authenticator.

2685
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:23,990
Like, an authenticity certificate that's on the card.

2686
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:31,010
So you scan the card, it'll tell you if it's, like, from that exact LaBooBoo, basically.

2687
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:32,110
Oh, wow, that's crazy.

2688
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:34,070
Yeah, it has, like, your own certificate of authenticity.

2689
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:36,770
So it's just some kind of...

2690
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:37,090
No!

2691
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:40,450
At least you get a product out of it.

2692
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:41,330
I know, right?

2693
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:42,670
You get a physical thing.

2694
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:45,030
And you own it.

2695
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:46,290
Yeah, you own it, too.

2696
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:47,930
So, yeah, I thought it was really...

2697
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:51,710
Yeah, it feels like it just came, like, like, the badge just came out of nowhere.

2698
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:53,890
But it's been around for a while.

2699
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:54,970
It's just been around.

2700
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,870
It just got super popular recently.

2701
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,650
Well, before that, it was, like, the little sunny angels.

2702
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,350
Oh, yeah, yeah, the little naked sun...

2703
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:03,470
The naked angels with the pee-pee out.

2704
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:05,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2705
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,070
Now it's LaBooBoo.

2706
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:08,330
Now it's LaBooBoo.

2707
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:11,330
I don't even know what the little kid angels were called.

2708
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:12,490
The little cupids.

2709
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:13,770
What were they called?

2710
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,270
Sunny angels?

2711
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,870
Were they actually just called sunny angels?

2712
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:17,390
Yeah, I think so.

2713
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:18,010
It was, like...

2714
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:19,390
Well, now you know why it died.

2715
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,750
LaBooBoo is so much...

2716
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:21,030
Oh, yeah!

2717
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:22,930
Before that was TokiDokies, yeah.

2718
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:24,450
I like TokiDokies.

2719
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:24,710
TokiDokies?

2720
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:24,990
Yeah!

2721
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:27,130
You ever know TokiDoki, the unicorns?

2722
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:30,090
Oh, were those popular?

2723
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,690
Yeah, they were really popular back then, TokiDokies.

2724
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:33,370
They were like everywhere.

2725
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:36,910
Okay, you're stalling.

2726
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:38,930
Okay, all right, here we go.

2727
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:40,650
Back to the basement.

2728
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,810
The basement call us for me.

2729
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:43,750
Back to the basement.

2730
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:45,590
I feel like I'm gonna die from the tar man soon.

2731
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:49,650
Back to the basement, back to the basement, back to the basement.

2732
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:52,110
All right, where do I go again?

2733
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:55,070
Uh, hold on, I lost the place.

2734
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:55,450
Okay.

2735
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:57,930
No, no, no, no, no!

2736
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,530
No, no, no, no.

2737
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:02,710
I was on pride instead of prison.

2738
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:06,110
Okay, I got it.

2739
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:06,730
Okay.

2740
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:08,930
So remember, we have to find that wall.

2741
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:10,710
So you got to go get the sledgehammer.

2742
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:12,650
Oh my god, that's stupid.

2743
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:13,630
I think.

2744
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:14,630
Okay.

2745
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:15,130
I don't know.

2746
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:17,890
If I die to the Charmant, then I don't care.

2747
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,030
Just quick save.

2748
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,030
Why are you suddenly... I did.

2749
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:24,130
No, you can't quick save.

2750
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,310
You have to manually save.

2751
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:26,510
I think.

2752
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:28,210
Oh no, it lets me quick save.

2753
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:28,410
Okay.

2754
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:31,070
Okay, we're about to go.

2755
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:31,770
Okay.

2756
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:35,630
Um... Go to that area.

2757
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:36,710
Oh, turn around.

2758
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:37,470
That way.

2759
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:38,070
That way?

2760
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:38,450
Nope.

2761
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:39,370
Right.

2762
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:39,870
There you go.

2763
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:40,350
That way, yeah.

2764
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:42,130
And go down the stairs.

2765
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:42,850
To the tarp.

2766
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:43,990
Okay.

2767
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:46,330
And then what?

2768
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:47,950
Look around.

2769
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,610
See if there's anything different.

2770
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:52,290
I'm still reading.

2771
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:52,330
I'm still reading.

2772
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,120
Step into the long hallway to the left of the tarp.

2773
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,200
In there.

2774
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,120
I guess.

2775
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,700
I'm going crazy again.

2776
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:04,600
Uh-oh.

2777
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,420
Turn the lights on.

2778
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:05,860
There you go.

2779
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:06,460
Okay.

2780
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:11,210
What?

2781
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:12,710
Dwayne will look up at a ceiling light.

2782
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:13,530
No?

2783
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:16,630
Um...

2784
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:17,250
What?

2785
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:17,950
Huh?

2786
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:19,050
What?

2787
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:20,830
What?

2788
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:23,130
What do you mean?

2789
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:25,850
How do you figure this out?

2790
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:26,150
Play the prison.

2791
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:27,690
How do you figure this out?

2792
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,250
How do you figure this out with the guide?

2793
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:30,190
How do you... I guess you'll be like...

2794
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:33,790
You have to, like, see if anything changes every time.

2795
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:39,010
Go to the area with the mannequin torso behind the blue tarp.

2796
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:41,650
Step into the long hallway to the left of the tarp.

2797
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:42,330
Oh.

2798
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:42,910
What?

2799
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:44,350
That's where we're at, no?

2800
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:45,330
Yeah.

2801
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:47,670
Once you're in the... Try going behind the tarp.

2802
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:48,430
Is there anything there?

2803
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:48,930
No.

2804
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:50,810
Try it.

2805
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:51,950
Okay.

2806
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:54,590
To the left of the tarp.

2807
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,430
This is... Is this not the hallway?

2808
01:33:57,530 --> 01:33:58,270
Right here.

2809
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:01,290
Nothing here.

2810
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:02,750
Oh.

2811
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:03,310
Nope.

2812
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:03,690
Nope.

2813
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:03,950
No.

2814
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,130
I mean, there's the mannequin.

2815
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,090
You did play it.

2816
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:09,910
Keep going deeper?

2817
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:10,810
Keep... Maybe, yeah.

2818
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:11,910
Maybe try going deeper.

2819
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:13,270
Keep going into the mines?

2820
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:13,970
Okay.

2821
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:14,830
Yeah.

2822
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:16,470
Into the mines we go.

2823
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:22,500
Oh.

2824
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:23,600
Oh.

2825
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:24,340
Oh.

2826
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:26,880
Wait.

2827
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:27,960
I didn't even need the hammer?

2828
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:29,420
You will.

2829
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:30,020
You will now.

2830
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:30,300
No.

2831
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:31,460
It took my hammer.

2832
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:32,500
Oh.

2833
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,600
It took my hammer.

2834
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,420
You have to go get...

2835
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,880
They... They took my hammer!

2836
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:38,220
They...

2837
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,040
They...

2838
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:39,980
They're like...

2839
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:40,260
Yoink.

2840
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:41,460
Yoink.

2841
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,700
It's fine.

2842
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:43,380
Uh...

2843
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:43,460
Yeah.

2844
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:43,920
Oh.

2845
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,020
Okay.

2846
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:44,760
There's the hammer.

2847
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:45,100
Okay.

2848
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,520
They just took my hammer and placed it there, I guess.

2849
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:48,220
Oh.

2850
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:48,420
Yeah.

2851
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:48,680
Oh.

2852
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,080
How kind of them, right?

2853
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,240
Oh.

2854
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:51,860
No.

2855
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,040
No.

2856
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:52,420
Turn around.

2857
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:52,880
Turn around.

2858
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,480
Break the door, right?

2859
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:55,900
Oh.

2860
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,640
Never mind.

2861
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,220
Oh.

2862
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:00,880
Scared me.

2863
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:01,480
Oh.

2864
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,640
Okay.

2865
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:03,060
Hello.

2866
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,240
Hi.

2867
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:04,680
Hi.

2868
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:05,940
Hi.

2869
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:14,760
Look into my eyes.

2870
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,120
It's so romantic when you choke me.

2871
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,540
Oh my gosh.

2872
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,340
This is so...

2873
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:24,760
Hold on.

2874
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,540
I'm going to read you this entire paragraph.

2875
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:28,080
Okay.

2876
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:28,660
Okay.

2877
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,360
So the lights will start to go out.

2878
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:31,760
Yeah.

2879
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:34,900
Three light bulbs stay on when all the others go off.

2880
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:38,620
The lights that stay on are highly important, both to see and for sanity.

2881
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,340
If you remember, the corridors are filled with sockets for light bulbs.

2882
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,980
I don't remember that at all.

2883
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:44,620
Oh my gosh.

2884
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,320
He's going to start coming.

2885
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:49,910
I hear him.

2886
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:50,310
Oh God.

2887
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:52,690
What?

2888
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:53,710
We don't have any light bulbs.

2889
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:55,390
We don't have any light bulbs.

2890
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:56,350
We didn't pick any up.

2891
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:56,470
Oh my gosh.

2892
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,770
They just threw us in here?

2893
01:35:58,190 --> 01:35:58,650
No way.

2894
01:35:58,810 --> 01:35:58,970
What?

2895
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:00,970
What?

2896
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:03,350
Did it just kill me?

2897
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:05,290
Hold on.

2898
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:06,550
Look at...

2899
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:08,690
Each corridor will have a breakable wall at the end.

2900
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:11,350
So it is important that you have light so you can see where to break the wall.

2901
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:13,170
The wall should be around the center.

2902
01:36:14,410 --> 01:36:15,210
Each corridor.

2903
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:17,510
Break the walls, then step inside the room.

2904
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:19,130
Each wall takes three hits to the street.

2905
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:21,170
It won't let me light it up!

2906
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:23,450
Wait.

2907
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:25,530
Can you take one of the light bulbs that's already on?

2908
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:27,010
Like up that one?

2909
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:28,490
No.

2910
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:29,270
Oh, that one?

2911
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:29,670
Oh, I can.

2912
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:30,370
Oh, you can.

2913
01:36:30,530 --> 01:36:30,730
Okay.

2914
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:33,490
You're going to go towards the guy?

2915
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:35,570
Did he come from here?

2916
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:36,270
Oh no.

2917
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:36,630
Yeah.

2918
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,390
Fuck me, I guess.

2919
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:41,070
Oh, it's like a little game.

2920
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:43,510
Okay.

2921
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:44,750
Okay, okay.

2922
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:48,430
Wait, so I had to die the first time?

2923
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:49,690
One, two...

2924
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:50,430
Oh, just kidding.

2925
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:51,750
Three!

2926
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:53,950
What happens here?

2927
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:54,370
Oh.

2928
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:54,710
Oh.

2929
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:56,830
You get a present.

2930
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:59,030
You beat it up.

2931
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:00,090
I beat it up.

2932
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:01,850
Oh, I'm getting a little crazy.

2933
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:04,870
Son.

2934
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:06,370
Son.

2935
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:07,530
Okay.

2936
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:10,590
All right, I think he's going to kill me.

2937
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:14,650
I guess he came from a different...

2938
01:37:14,650 --> 01:37:15,930
He comes from a different way this time.

2939
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:16,330
Yeah.

2940
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:18,810
Oh my god.

2941
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:19,410
I'm scared.

2942
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:20,010
Me too.

2943
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:20,930
I don't like this.

2944
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:22,210
I don't like this either.

2945
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:23,570
I don't like this at all.

2946
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:26,190
I feel like this little game of light bulb.

2947
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:27,590
Why was the guy even in here?

2948
01:37:27,690 --> 01:37:28,810
I feel like this way is difficult.

2949
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:30,510
You just...

2950
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:32,290
You just wanted to be like, Ooga-booga-booga.

2951
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:32,810
Why did he...

2952
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:33,390
No, why did he...

2953
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:34,010
Where did he come from?

2954
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:34,690
Why was he here?

2955
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:36,050
Ooga-booga-booga.

2956
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:37,750
Oh, I see my brain now.

2957
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:39,370
Yes.

2958
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:40,550
Can he get in there?

2959
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:42,450
No?

2960
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:43,250
No?

2961
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:45,890
What am I supposed to do here?

2962
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:47,310
I don't know.

2963
01:37:48,850 --> 01:37:49,250
I don't know.

2964
01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:53,070
Oh, the...

2965
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:54,590
This one is too high for you to reach.

2966
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:55,410
Oh.

2967
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:57,050
Then what?

2968
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:58,230
Can I go to the last one?

2969
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:00,670
Um, hold on.

2970
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:01,330
Oh my gosh.

2971
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:03,170
There's a stupid special achievement.

2972
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:03,730
I don't care.

2973
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:07,970
Once all the four walls are broken, return to the wall from the exit sign.

2974
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,850
And there will be the...

2975
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:10,250
The...

2976
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:10,990
The...

2977
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:12,730
The little mask piece that you need.

2978
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:14,550
I'm gonna die here.

2979
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:15,590
I see my brain.

2980
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:18,350
I don't like it when I see my brain.

2981
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:20,630
Wait, why are there so many hallways?

2982
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,150
When did this get so...

2983
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:22,370
Yeah.

2984
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:25,590
Wait, I think you only need to go to the...

2985
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:28,030
Well, it said four.

2986
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:29,890
Yeah, there's one more here.

2987
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:31,770
Oh.

2988
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:32,970
It said four, right?

2989
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:34,010
So I have to break two more.

2990
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:36,450
Oh, you're right.

2991
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,750
You're right.

2992
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:37,050
You're right.

2993
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:39,970
I don't like that I can see my brain right now.

2994
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:44,570
Uh, let's just stay in the light for a bit.

2995
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:46,290
Oh, will that help you move?

2996
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:50,990
Wait, how do I...

2997
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:51,770
Drop it?

2998
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:53,370
Wait.

2999
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:54,890
How do I...

3000
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:55,850
What do I do with this?

3001
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:57,110
Oh, no.

3002
01:38:58,370 --> 01:38:59,590
You're so helpful.

3003
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:03,130
It doesn't...

3004
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:04,410
It literally doesn't tell you.

3005
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:06,310
It just says break all the walls.

3006
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:11,040
Box.

3007
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:12,760
Box.

3008
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:13,500
Box.

3009
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:14,080
Just a box.

3010
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:16,340
It's a little box.

3011
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,420
I see my brain and I don't like it.

3012
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:22,820
I'm not supposed to see my brain, I feel like.

3013
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:23,880
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

3014
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:24,920
Bonk.

3015
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:26,640
Bonk.

3016
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,580
Maybe that's why...

3017
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:28,660
Bonk.

3018
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:29,780
Uh, the guy showed up.

3019
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,760
Because you could see your brain.

3020
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:33,080
No, I didn't see my brain, though, that time.

3021
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:35,620
Uh...

3022
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:37,680
Oh, there's people watching me here.

3023
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,940
But I'm going crazy looking at it.

3024
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:40,940
Yeah.

3025
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,220
Maybe don't look at it, then.

3026
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,320
But they call for me.

3027
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:46,540
Okay.

3028
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:47,860
So you broke them?

3029
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:49,860
Yeah, so I go...

3030
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,540
I should be allowed to go through, right?

3031
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,420
I suppose.

3032
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,660
So turn to the wall with the exit sign and there will be a miracle.

3033
01:39:58,660 --> 01:39:59,180
Oh, yeah, look.

3034
01:39:59,280 --> 01:39:59,460
See?

3035
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:00,320
It's more breakable.

3036
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,360
Ah, yeah, it's there.

3037
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:02,180
There you go.

3038
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:06,420
Ooh, why is it so wet all of a sudden?

3039
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,260
Oh!

3040
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:10,960
And then I get to leave!

3041
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,080
Yippee!

3042
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,240
Yippee!

3043
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:16,580
Okay.

3044
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:17,820
Alright, we got another one.

3045
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,460
Well, that wasn't bad.

3046
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:21,820
That one wasn't bad.

3047
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,940
Except for the time that guy was like, Fuck you.

3048
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,500
Why was he there?

3049
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,160
Yeah.

3050
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:28,460
Oh, did you see that?

3051
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:29,180
It returned to normal.

3052
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:29,680
Oh, yeah.

3053
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:32,060
Okay, I need to find a candle.

3054
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:34,820
Or some light.

3055
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:35,400
Just...

3056
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,000
No, I think...

3057
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,860
You can stand in the light.

3058
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,960
It says like, I have to stand in candle area, though.

3059
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,360
Oh.

3060
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,220
What just happened?

3061
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,100
They closed the door on me.

3062
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:44,820
Rude!

3063
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:46,300
Rude!

3064
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:47,600
Don't worry.

3065
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:49,460
Your candle's about to go out.

3066
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:50,420
I'm worrying.

3067
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,180
It's not getting any lighter.

3068
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:55,600
Oh.

3069
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:56,460
Wait, it is!

3070
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:57,180
Why is...

3071
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,780
Oh, okay.

3072
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,120
There you go.

3073
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:00,880
Why is the music so...

3074
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,160
I don't like that.

3075
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:03,300
Oh.

3076
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:04,640
Oh.

3077
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:05,120
Oh!

3078
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:05,620
Oh!

3079
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:07,360
Uh.

3080
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:08,360
Uh.

3081
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:15,740
Oh my god.

3082
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:16,780
Don't move it so fast.

3083
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:19,860
Just keep it there.

3084
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:22,200
Oh, I don't think that...

3085
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:22,980
I don't think holding it...

3086
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:24,900
Okay.

3087
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:25,500
Okay, there you go.

3088
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:25,860
There you go.

3089
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:27,660
Okay.

3090
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:28,320
Okay.

3091
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:30,620
I still see my brain.

3092
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:32,020
That's not good.

3093
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,680
I still...

3094
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,140
I still see my brain right now.

3095
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:39,240
That's...

3096
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:40,840
That's not good.

3097
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,100
All right.

3098
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,500
I'm putting the next two tapes.

3099
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:50,520
Wait, no.

3100
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,480
We didn't do the other one.

3101
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:52,540
Yeah, but the other one's right here.

3102
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:53,400
We could do that one every.

3103
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:54,880
Okay, all right.

3104
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:55,100
You're right.

3105
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:57,260
Yeah, so we should do the ones that are like...

3106
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,800
I keep accidentally blowing the candles.

3107
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:00,720
Oops.

3108
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:02,560
Okay, a difference.

3109
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,040
What if I'm like watching the video...

3110
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,580
And then the guy just starts coming off with the ceiling?

3111
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:12,840
Why is your...

3112
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,440
Why is your sanity going so down?

3113
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:15,140
I don't know.

3114
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:16,220
I don't like it.

3115
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:18,380
Oh, there's a door.

3116
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:19,360
It feels like it's like really bad.

3117
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:20,400
Yeah.

3118
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,860
There's a door with keys.

3119
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:24,060
It's a nudist beach.

3120
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:26,240
Okay.

3121
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:27,420
Oh!

3122
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:30,300
I don't want to see the naked people.

3123
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,520
Okay, there's paintings.

3124
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:35,440
Paintings.

3125
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:44,360
Oh.

3126
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,400
Spiral stairs.

3127
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:45,940
Spiral stairs.

3128
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:47,740
What is this?

3129
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:48,780
A lighthouse?

3130
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,320
It's Europe.

3131
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,300
Europe?

3132
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:55,260
Yeah, there's a nudist beach.

3133
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:56,340
Oh.

3134
01:42:57,180 --> 01:42:58,000
Oh, okay.

3135
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:58,700
Oh.

3136
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,800
There's multiple things.

3137
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:03,940
Wait, which one do we go to?

3138
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:04,660
I don't know.

3139
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:06,380
They showed us four different locations.

3140
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:11,460
Oh, this table show a chain door in several places on the wall for picture frames.

3141
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:12,060
Yeah.

3142
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:14,380
Oh, so we have to find picture frames.

3143
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:15,580
God damn it.

3144
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,400
Wait, the final set of images show you the locations for each collectible item that you'll need to complete this tape adventure.

3145
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,120
Oh, gosh.

3146
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:24,620
Okay, we're doing that next time.

3147
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:25,860
We're doing that the other time.

3148
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:26,960
No, I think this one will be long.

3149
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,000
I think we should do it now.

3150
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:28,480
Okay.

3151
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,600
Don't put in another one.

3152
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,380
Just keep this one on, you know?

3153
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,500
Okay, but what if the other one's easy?

3154
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:35,820
I mean, I guess.

3155
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:36,340
Yeah.

3156
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,780
Yeah, I'm going to check the other one.

3157
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:38,120
Okay.

3158
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:39,700
Let's do...

3159
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,080
Negligence.

3160
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:44,620
How is my sanity going down?

3161
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:46,440
I'm next to the candle.

3162
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,180
Who's going ooga-booga-booga?

3163
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:52,790
Okay, this is negligence.

3164
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:54,170
Negligence.

3165
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:57,650
Oh, is that not where we are?

3166
01:43:58,090 --> 01:43:58,710
No, it's not.

3167
01:43:58,790 --> 01:43:59,510
No, that's the basement.

3168
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:01,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3169
01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:03,370
Again, it's like everything's the basement, apparently.

3170
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:04,190
Oh, my God.

3171
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,270
It all happens in the basement.

3172
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,530
I'm looking for negligence.

3173
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:18,390
Okay, you're still dancing.

3174
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,090
It has not stopped dancing.

3175
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,640
Oh, wait, where's this?

3176
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,660
This is the hospital.

3177
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:30,140
How do we get to the hospital?

3178
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:31,800
From the basement.

3179
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:33,880
Okay, but how do we...

3180
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,620
Whoa, look at him, girl.

3181
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:38,540
Whoa, whoa.

3182
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:39,120
Whoa.

3183
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:40,340
Yep.

3184
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:41,260
Oh.

3185
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:42,480
Okay.

3186
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,480
Okay.

3187
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:45,620
Okay, but how do we get there?

3188
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:47,860
Go to the TV room in the basement.

3189
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,060
Yeah, but how do we get there from...

3190
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:50,940
Oh, your brain's gone.

3191
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:52,420
My brain's gone.

3192
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:55,280
Yippee, empty-minded, as I've always wanted.

3193
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,740
All right, back to the basement I go.

3194
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,080
Okay.

3195
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:06,810
To the TV room.

3196
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:07,730
It's this way.

3197
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:09,670
No.

3198
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:11,170
Oh, it's the other way.

3199
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:12,890
The TV room?

3200
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:16,550
Right there.

3201
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:21,010
Okay, and then what do we do?

3202
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:24,970
Step into the area with the TV and the sofa.

3203
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:27,110
Check the pictures on the wall besides the sofa.

3204
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:28,350
And take the rec...

3205
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:28,550
Oh.

3206
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:28,990
Take that.

3207
01:45:29,770 --> 01:45:30,130
Okay.

3208
01:45:30,370 --> 01:45:31,010
And then play it.

3209
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:38,250
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

3210
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:40,130
I hope they play crazy frog.

3211
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:41,610
Oh, pew, pew, pew, pew.

3212
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:42,930
I am a gummy bear.

3213
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:45,910
You are a gummy bear, but...

3214
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:48,530
Oh, hey, it's a nice shopping mall.

3215
01:45:48,690 --> 01:45:49,130
Let's go.

3216
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:50,810
Oh, we're going shopping.

3217
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:52,310
You know, someone made...

3218
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:56,250
There's, like, a guy who's, like, incredibly obsessed with the gummy bear song where they pre...

3219
01:45:56,250 --> 01:46:00,990
They made their own render of the gummy bear song, but it made it look like it was made in 2025.

3220
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:02,830
What?

3221
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:03,830
Yeah.

3222
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:05,410
They, like, re-rendered...

3223
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:07,170
They, like, made their own gummy bear render.

3224
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:09,470
This guy is so loud.

3225
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:10,350
Oh, I'm an alcoholic.

3226
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:11,130
Let's go!

3227
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:13,230
Crack beer!

3228
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:15,810
Nothing bad happens to alcoholics.

3229
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:16,290
Wait.

3230
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:17,810
Just put them in your...

3231
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:18,590
Put them in your...

3232
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:19,070
Oh, you're right.

3233
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:19,750
Oh, it's a special price.

3234
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:20,650
Yeah, take them, take them.

3235
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,370
Oh, you're right.

3236
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:22,270
Oh, my God.

3237
01:46:22,590 --> 01:46:23,450
Special price?

3238
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:24,290
What a steal.

3239
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:25,830
What a steal.

3240
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:27,770
No cheese, no soup, no tomatoes.

3241
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:29,070
Beer only.

3242
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:30,610
Beer, beer, beer.

3243
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:30,670
Beer, beer.

3244
01:46:30,670 --> 01:46:31,490
Nothing but beer.

3245
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:32,290
Beer o'clock.

3246
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:33,670
Beer o'clock.

3247
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:34,530
Beer o'clock.

3248
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:34,870
Beer o'clock.

3249
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:37,250
What they don't know, it says always beer o'clock.

3250
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:38,130
Get a car.

3251
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:40,490
No, I can fit, like, two more.

3252
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:41,210
I don't have kids.

3253
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:42,230
Let's go.

3254
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,530
Buy us chocolate, Doki.

3255
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:50,330
We got all your needs for food, especially drinks.

3256
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,010
Yippee.

3257
01:46:52,190 --> 01:46:52,590
Yippee.

3258
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,610
Beer, beer, beer.

3259
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:57,610
Yeah, beer would be nice.

3260
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:58,930
Yeah, do you think we need more?

3261
01:46:59,170 --> 01:46:59,870
Oh, do you think...

3262
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:01,190
I think we need more beer.

3263
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:03,090
Oh, my God.

3264
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,810
Please, I can fit two more.

3265
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:06,330
One for the...

3266
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:07,730
We should have held off for some beer.

3267
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:08,450
Yeah, we should...

3268
01:47:08,450 --> 01:47:08,690
Yeah.

3269
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:11,270
I told you we should have got that box of beers.

3270
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:12,810
We could have got this box of beers.

3271
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:15,110
Yeah, we should have gotten that box of beers.

3272
01:47:15,110 --> 01:47:15,230
Yeah.

3273
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:16,130
We need more.

3274
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:16,910
We got arms.

3275
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:18,490
We can put it on the side of our arms.

3276
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:19,870
Oh, it's cheap today.

3277
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:21,150
Only today, too.

3278
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:21,970
Only today.

3279
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:22,930
What a bargain.

3280
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:24,490
Yeah, there's no reason not to.

3281
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:25,870
Look at that.

3282
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:29,210
Maybe two.

3283
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:29,610
Maybe three.

3284
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:29,990
Don't worry.

3285
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:30,730
Maybe three.

3286
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:31,390
Five.

3287
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:34,450
One for evening, one for later tonight, and one for midnight.

3288
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:35,270
Let's go.

3289
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:36,330
Yeah.

3290
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,740
Sir, I know.

3291
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:41,620
I got it.

3292
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:42,300
I have problems.

3293
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,080
I already know.

3294
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:45,100
Two beers in the morning?

3295
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:46,040
I wondered.

3296
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,120
For your cereal.

3297
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:48,480
For your cereal.

3298
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:49,940
Beer cereal?

3299
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:51,060
Oh, my God.

3300
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,740
Yeah, beer.

3301
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:54,060
The best time to start my...

3302
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:54,580
The beer.

3303
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,700
Best time to start your morning.

3304
01:47:58,820 --> 01:47:59,340
That's...

3305
01:47:59,340 --> 01:47:59,760
What's it?

3306
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:00,700
Nothing.

3307
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:01,660
If you're...

3308
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:04,500
If you're drunk in the morning, there's zero consequences.

3309
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:11,500
Nothing better than waking up with a beer in your cup.

3310
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:14,600
Beautiful.

3311
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:17,160
Did you just come up with that yourself?

3312
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:18,100
Just then?

3313
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:19,660
It's like a...

3314
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,000
Isn't that Folgers?

3315
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,360
There's like a coffee brand in the US.

3316
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:23,840
What?

3317
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:25,480
That's like...

3318
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,420
If you want...

3319
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:28,520
Or nothing better than waking up and having...

3320
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:29,580
Fol...

3321
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,820
Folgers...

3322
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:31,980
Fol...

3323
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,500
...sures in your cup.

3324
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:34,920
Time to drink.

3325
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:35,800
Oh, my God.

3326
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,000
Don't really say...

3327
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:37,460
One in the m...

3328
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:38,860
One or two in the morning.

3329
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:40,260
Yeah.

3330
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,460
We got a special price.

3331
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:43,300
Don't feel guilty.

3332
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:43,900
Yeah.

3333
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:46,760
Can't let it have you be inspired.

3334
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:48,540
What a day.

3335
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:50,320
Okay, this might actually be the easiest one.

3336
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,260
All you had to do was...

3337
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:54,140
Grab beer and drink it.

3338
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:55,240
Daddy?

3339
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:57,140
Oh, my God.

3340
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:58,760
Oh, my God.

3341
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,380
Little Sarah wants a story.

3342
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:02,180
And once upon a time...

3343
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:04,000
Daddy bought lots of beer.

3344
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:05,580
Lots of funny juice.

3345
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:07,240
And now he's pretty funny.

3346
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,840
Are you pressing this to drink?

3347
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:12,760
LB to drink?

3348
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,180
My daughter talks to me...

3349
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:16,140
So I have to drink now.

3350
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:21,190
I have a bedtime story.

3351
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:23,550
Are you just going to ignore her?

3352
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:23,990
What?

3353
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:25,930
Time to drink.

3354
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:28,270
You don't talk.

3355
01:49:28,450 --> 01:49:29,690
You don't sleep in the bedroom.

3356
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:30,850
You don't get out at all.

3357
01:49:31,010 --> 01:49:32,250
You just don't care.

3358
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:32,690
Do you?

3359
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:35,270
We signed nothing to have us not care.

3360
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:35,970
Oh, my God.

3361
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:36,510
You're right.

3362
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:37,170
Sorry.

3363
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:38,630
I signed a contract with a crow.

3364
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:40,730
Oh, the walls are melting.

3365
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:42,010
The walls are melting.

3366
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:43,850
Croaky told me to do it.

3367
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,810
I didn't read the contract fully.

3368
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:47,590
Sorry.

3369
01:49:47,810 --> 01:49:48,970
I checked the time.

3370
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,130
It's a beer o'clock.

3371
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,650
Dwayne, it's always beer o'clock.

3372
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:56,110
Does he just not...

3373
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:57,010
Does he just like...

3374
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:58,050
He just drinks.

3375
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:00,230
Yeah, he just drinks and...

3376
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:01,990
And watches TV.

3377
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:03,830
Just another day.

3378
01:50:04,190 --> 01:50:04,770
Don't worry.

3379
01:50:05,190 --> 01:50:07,870
My wife's just going through some phase right now.

3380
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:09,970
Like, I think drunk people...

3381
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:11,290
Like, you know...

3382
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:13,090
Drunk people at least will talk to you.

3383
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:13,630
I don't know.

3384
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:14,270
Yeah.

3385
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:18,490
The walls are kind of crazy.

3386
01:50:18,830 --> 01:50:18,950
Yeah.

3387
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:19,650
Oh.

3388
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:20,230
Oh.

3389
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:21,850
You have too much to drink.

3390
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:22,590
You have too much?

3391
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:25,230
Oh, I'm choking.

3392
01:50:25,950 --> 01:50:26,690
From what?

3393
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:27,690
Oh, from glass.

3394
01:50:28,110 --> 01:50:28,290
Whoops.

3395
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:29,570
God, check...

3396
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:30,250
It's like when you...

3397
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:31,730
During the Halloween, you all check your candy.

3398
01:50:31,730 --> 01:50:32,690
There's glass in it.

3399
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:33,290
Yeah.

3400
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:33,790
Oh, my God.

3401
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:35,810
Remember, check your beer.

3402
01:50:35,930 --> 01:50:36,850
There's glass in it.

3403
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:37,330
Check your beer.

3404
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:38,670
There's glass in it.

3405
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:42,200
Right.

3406
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:43,640
That was that one.

3407
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:44,120
Oh, that one.

3408
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:44,800
That was so easy.

3409
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:46,960
Yeah, and they put me back in the TV room, too.

3410
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,320
No, they're going to send you back...

3411
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:51,500
To a different place.

3412
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:51,960
Oh.

3413
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,260
Oh, can you see anything?

3414
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:55,700
Oh, okay.

3415
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:57,520
Where do I go?

3416
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:57,980
Oh.

3417
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:59,360
I'm hungover right now.

3418
01:50:59,500 --> 01:50:59,720
Yeah.

3419
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,400
Oh, they did put you back in there.

3420
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:02,780
Never mind.

3421
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:03,060
You're right.

3422
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:03,340
Yeah.

3423
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,460
My TV room is a little crazy right now.

3424
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,540
It's a little messed up now.

3425
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:10,600
Can you, like, turn the lights on?

3426
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:11,640
Why is it so...

3427
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:14,260
I'm not okay.

3428
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:16,340
Why is it so blurry in here?

3429
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:18,260
Can I, like, be sober?

3430
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:20,020
Yeah.

3431
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,180
How do I watch?

3432
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:22,660
Wait, no.

3433
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:23,720
This room is...

3434
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:24,020
Wait.

3435
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:26,460
How do I get out of this room?

3436
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,680
Do I close it and it'll turn back to normal?

3437
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:29,820
Oh, maybe, yeah.

3438
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:30,540
Oh.

3439
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:32,280
No, my room's fucked.

3440
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:32,620
No.

3441
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,640
Maybe just keep going somewhere else.

3442
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,100
I don't know.

3443
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:36,500
Wait.

3444
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:36,840
Oh.

3445
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:38,100
Oh, now it's okay.

3446
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:39,360
Oh, my game crashed.

3447
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:41,780
No way.

3448
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:43,120
Oh, my God.

3449
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:43,280
Oh, my God.

3450
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,500
Oh, no.

3451
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:45,400
No way.

3452
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:46,800
Oh, my game.

3453
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:47,220
No.

3454
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,000
It had to have saved.

3455
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:50,860
It had to have saved after that.

3456
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:55,660
It, like, closed the door on me and then it crashed.

3457
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,040
Oh.

3458
01:51:59,300 --> 01:51:59,780
No.

3459
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:00,300
Okay.

3460
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:00,840
All right.

3461
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:01,940
We know what to do.

3462
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:03,680
We just gotta grab Beers.

3463
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:04,480
Doors.

3464
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,340
No, it's probably saved after you got the piece, I imagine.

3465
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,540
I feel like...

3466
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:10,100
I don't know.

3467
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:10,700
Oh, I...

3468
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:13,100
They said you have to manually save now throughout the...

3469
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:13,580
This chapter.

3470
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,760
So, they don't auto-save anymore.

3471
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:17,320
Oh.

3472
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,000
No.

3473
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:20,160
No.

3474
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,380
We'll find out.

3475
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:24,180
Oh, my God.

3476
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:24,780
Wait, no.

3477
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:25,360
Oh, it did.

3478
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,380
It saved the moment it closed the door.

3479
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:27,840
Yay.

3480
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:28,480
Oh, see?

3481
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:28,760
See?

3482
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:29,020
See?

3483
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,120
Actually, I don't know.

3484
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,460
I don't know where I'm at, though.

3485
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,700
No, the candle's still here, though.

3486
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:33,960
Wait.

3487
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:34,800
Is that my candle?

3488
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:35,540
I could be.

3489
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:36,340
I don't know.

3490
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:39,000
You could go to the progress room, maybe, and see.

3491
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:40,200
That's true.

3492
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,500
Because that's where the things have been showing up.

3493
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:42,780
Oh, yeah.

3494
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:43,300
You're right.

3495
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,040
Yeah.

3496
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:44,740
I could check.

3497
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:46,420
How many did we get, though?

3498
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,200
Four?

3499
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,800
All right.

3500
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:52,420
Let's see.

3501
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:53,720
I can't remember.

3502
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:54,460
I don't know.

3503
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,340
Oh, look at all the beers I've been drinking.

3504
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,980
Oh, this is the place where I've been drinking.

3505
01:52:58,700 --> 01:52:59,720
Is that romantic?

3506
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:01,340
Oh, yeah.

3507
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:02,960
Look how many beers there are.

3508
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:05,860
Does this place raise my sanity?

3509
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:07,840
Okay, we have three.

3510
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,820
Wait, we have four.

3511
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:10,740
Did we do four already?

3512
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:12,100
That's why I said four.

3513
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:13,000
I think it's four.

3514
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:14,460
Oh, yeah.

3515
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:14,920
Four.

3516
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:15,880
Yeah, we're missing three.

3517
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:16,900
Is that correct?

3518
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:18,540
That sounds right.

3519
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:20,260
All right.

3520
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,520
So, what was the one that was really long?

3521
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:24,240
It was the painting one.

3522
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:25,920
Yeah, but I don't...

3523
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,000
Which was it called?

3524
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:29,620
It's in my hand, so I can grab the other two now.

3525
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:32,800
And then we'll do the painting one there at, like, second last.

3526
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,580
Because that shit looks long.

3527
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:35,000
Okay.

3528
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:36,280
We can do pride.

3529
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:38,580
Well, pride is the one by the door.

3530
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:41,180
Yeah, so that one we'll do the very last last.

3531
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:43,040
Because then we get that done right up.

3532
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:44,220
I'm not crazy.

3533
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:46,020
Oh, my candle's gone.

3534
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:48,160
You're not crazy?

3535
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:48,920
Oh, yes, you are.

3536
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:49,580
Yeah, yes, you are.

3537
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:50,200
Oh, wait.

3538
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,160
How about two?

3539
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:52,940
Oh, that's what...

3540
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:54,200
Can you share the game?

3541
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,160
Sorry, I was watching through the stream.

3542
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,140
I was like...

3543
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,600
I was like, why am I so beloved?

3544
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:00,060
I'm not behind.

3545
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:01,420
Wait, did I not?

3546
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,760
Yeah, no, I'm sharing it right now.

3547
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:04,620
You're not seeing it?

3548
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,660
I bet I'm getting paused.

3549
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:07,740
Okay, I'll reshare it.

3550
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:08,720
Yeah.

3551
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:09,560
All right.

3552
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:12,060
Massage.

3553
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:12,760
Don't worry.

3554
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,120
I'll give you even lower quality.

3555
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:16,400
Wait, why isn't it...

3556
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:16,920
Oh, there we go.

3557
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:17,300
Watch the stream.

3558
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:18,140
Okay, I'll give that 1080.

3559
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,260
You don't need 14, 480p.

3560
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:22,660
Yeah, whatever.

3561
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,240
Okay, fine.

3562
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:26,320
Wait, but I only have one tape left.

3563
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:29,240
But we have two that you...

3564
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:29,900
Oh, we have two.

3565
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:30,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3566
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:31,580
Yeah.

3567
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:32,920
I can't...

3568
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:33,520
Sorry, I can't count.

3569
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:34,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3570
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:38,360
Okay, we got...

3571
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:38,920
We did that.

3572
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:39,460
Wait.

3573
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:40,520
I think this one...

3574
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:40,740
Oh, no.

3575
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,220
We got addictions.

3576
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:42,400
Oh, wait.

3577
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:42,720
That's...

3578
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:44,620
Indifference we didn't do.

3579
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:47,100
We need to do...

3580
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:48,140
Okay, next one is addiction.

3581
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:49,920
Okay.

3582
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:51,380
Oh, my gosh.

3583
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:51,760
Stop.

3584
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:53,000
Discord.

3585
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:54,400
You suck now.

3586
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:58,280
Yeah, because the CEO resigned and it got bought by...

3587
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:58,760
What was it?

3588
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,280
The Blizzard CEO?

3589
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:01,600
Yeah, something like that.

3590
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:02,840
That's the new CEO now.

3591
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:05,840
All right.

3592
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:06,260
Okay.

3593
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:06,460
Where's that?

3594
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:07,540
Oh, that's the parents' bedroom.

3595
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:09,120
Yes.

3596
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,280
Oh, yeah.

3597
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:11,860
It went to the market, too.

3598
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,000
It went to the stock market.

3599
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,580
Yeah, they opened up.

3600
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:15,440
Yeah, they opened up.

3601
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:18,420
Now, Discord is controlled by 80-year-old men.

3602
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:18,980
Good luck.

3603
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,740
Guys, we still have TeamSpeak.

3604
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:24,420
Don't...

3605
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:28,120
We can always go back to TeamSpeak.

3606
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,120
Oh, 7, Discord.

3607
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:32,660
Wait.

3608
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:33,840
What do we do?

3609
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,240
This is in the parents' bedroom.

3610
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,040
Yeah, I think we just go up there.

3611
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,220
Yeah, go upstairs.

3612
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:40,680
Step into the parents' bedroom.

3613
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:41,280
And, yeah.

3614
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:41,740
You'll go.

3615
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:49,620
The radio's been on.

3616
01:55:50,680 --> 01:55:52,000
Oh, little cuckoo.

3617
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:53,940
Nah.

3618
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:55,040
All right.

3619
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:55,860
That hole in the ground?

3620
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:56,200
Wait.

3621
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:57,140
There's a hole in the ground.

3622
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,680
Where did my bed go?

3623
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:03,320
You sold it for beer.

3624
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:04,540
Oh.

3625
01:56:04,780 --> 01:56:05,800
The deals were too good.

3626
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:06,480
Hello.

3627
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:07,020
Whoa.

3628
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,360
Oh, my God.

3629
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:09,140
Oh, my God.

3630
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:09,920
I did not like that.

3631
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:10,300
Beer?

3632
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:12,700
Is that really beer?

3633
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,100
Yeah.

3634
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:14,580
My wife.

3635
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:17,560
Oh, you don't have a lot.

3636
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:17,820
Oh.

3637
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:18,680
Wait.

3638
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:19,060
Oh.

3639
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:19,680
Use the light.

3640
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,380
I want to see what it looks like with the lighter.

3641
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:23,280
It's beer.

3642
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,580
Oh, it really is beer.

3643
01:56:24,860 --> 01:56:25,820
My beautiful wife.

3644
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,020
Oh, wow.

3645
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,600
I'll never betray you.

3646
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:32,920
More beer.

3647
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:34,900
I've been waiting for you for quite some time now.

3648
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:35,260
All right.

3649
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:36,660
You're my friend, aren't you?

3650
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:37,460
Yeah.

3651
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:39,660
Is that a plague doctor's mask?

3652
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:40,420
Yeah, it is.

3653
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:43,140
What a look you have.

3654
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:44,740
Are you tired somehow?

3655
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:46,400
I getcha.

3656
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:47,240
It's hard.

3657
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:47,820
Oh, can I drink?

3658
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:48,340
Oh, nice.

3659
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:48,800
I can drink.

3660
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:49,300
Nice.

3661
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:50,260
Nice.

3662
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:51,880
I do not want to talk to...

3663
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:52,900
I do not want to listen to you.

3664
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,440
And I'm glad you came along.

3665
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,200
More beer.

3666
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:57,840
We're here to talk about you, right?

3667
01:56:58,140 --> 01:56:58,780
Yeah, me.

3668
01:56:59,160 --> 01:56:59,860
Can I keep drinking?

3669
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:02,320
I don't have a problem.

3670
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:12,000
I don't need him to tell me to do it.

3671
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:13,660
I have no control of my life.

3672
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:14,060
Dwayne.

3673
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:14,580
Of course.

3674
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,220
There's no mystery here.

3675
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:19,760
But I can see that you are wondering if this is real after all.

3676
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:21,640
I can assure you...

3677
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:22,200
We're not real.

3678
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,940
Although this might not reassure...

3679
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:24,320
We're anime.

3680
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:26,000
That it is...

3681
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,360
I'm real...

3682
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:27,580
Anime.

3683
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,700
She's a ghost.

3684
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:34,100
You don't even know she's right behind you right now.

3685
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:35,240
No, no.

3686
01:57:35,420 --> 01:57:36,640
Don't look at me like that.

3687
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,520
I'm on your side, Dwayne.

3688
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,160
We've been friends for so long after all.

3689
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:42,060
Yeah, that's my best friend.

3690
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:43,440
That's my best friend.

3691
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:43,900
Yeah.

3692
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:45,660
No, he's my best friend.

3693
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:47,920
He was my friend.

3694
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:48,980
Ice Monkey is my best friend.

3695
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:49,420
Wait, no.

3696
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:49,660
Wait.

3697
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,160
Can we trade?

3698
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:53,560
Wait.

3699
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:55,000
Ice Monkey is a better friend.

3700
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:55,620
Can we trade?

3701
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:58,780
No, you already said this guy is your best friend.

3702
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:01,460
Yeah, but I can't multiple best friends.

3703
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:04,600
No, you can't prioritize all of them equally.

3704
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:05,860
Okay, that's true.

3705
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:07,080
But...

3706
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:12,280
But I can...

3707
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:13,380
Oh, take a sip.

3708
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,160
Oh, okay.

3709
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:14,480
Yeah.

3710
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,760
I'll take a sip.

3711
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,520
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

3712
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,240
I wanted a drink a while ago.

3713
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:29,920
I bet my best friend can beat up your best friend.

3714
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,460
If you want me to help you, I've got to know something.

3715
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:33,400
I doubt it.

3716
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:35,280
My best friend is really...

3717
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:36,060
Oh.

3718
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:36,460
No?

3719
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,360
Well, what could be the reason behind all that drinking and drugging?

3720
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:41,580
Wait, I do drugging too?

3721
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:43,740
Yeah.

3722
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:44,520
What?

3723
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,620
Oh, I don't know what...

3724
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:46,960
What?

3725
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:47,340
When?

3726
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:49,320
I thought you were just an alcoholic.

3727
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:50,440
I...

3728
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:52,520
Maybe it's the pills.

3729
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:53,080
I don't know.

3730
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:53,580
Whoa.

3731
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,800
Yeah, you took all your pills, remember, Doki?

3732
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:57,340
Oh, yeah.

3733
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:58,360
That's the drugging.

3734
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,460
I took all of them.

3735
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:02,020
Oh, take a sip.

3736
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:02,320
Oh, yeah.

3737
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:02,980
Sure.

3738
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,200
Drink a little of this wonderful poison.

3739
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:07,920
It'll do you real good.

3740
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:08,980
Yay.

3741
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:10,780
Drinking away my problems.

3742
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:11,840
Yay.

3743
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:17,160
See, I knew doing this one was easier than the fucking Easter hunt.

3744
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:18,980
I still see them.

3745
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:19,540
He lied.

3746
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:20,760
Yeah.

3747
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:23,860
Do you need to drink another one?

3748
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:26,260
Oh, that drink until they're gone?

3749
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:29,800
Cheers.

3750
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:31,320
Cheers.

3751
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:32,640
Yippee.

3752
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:37,500
How much am I drinking?

3753
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:38,420
Because there's still some...

3754
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:38,880
Oh, they're gone.

3755
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:39,260
See?

3756
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:40,240
Oh, yeah, they're gone.

3757
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:40,600
I know it.

3758
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,720
You know you can always rely on this to get you back on track, don't you?

3759
01:59:45,580 --> 01:59:46,020
Yeah.

3760
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,760
Yeah, see, my best friend makes...

3761
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,080
Gives me free alcohol.

3762
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:52,120
What the fuck does Ice Monkey do?

3763
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:55,960
I'm telling Ice Monkey you said that.

3764
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:56,740
Wait, don't tell him that.

3765
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:57,300
Don't...

3766
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:03,940
I'm calling him and be like, Jake, don't believe it.

3767
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:05,640
I would never insult you.

3768
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:11,360
Wait, wait, it's just a joke.

3769
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:12,800
It's just a joke.

3770
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,200
He meant nothing to me.

3771
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:16,420
It's Ice Monkey all the way.

3772
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,280
Wait, did you tell me to drink?

3773
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:20,820
I don't know.

3774
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:21,880
I'm just gonna drink anyway.

3775
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:23,700
I just drink anyway.

3776
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:25,760
Cheers.

3777
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:26,060
Cheers.

3778
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,900
I was too busy thinking of him.

3779
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:30,760
Ice Monkey.

3780
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:35,940
Ice Monkey is the real cure to our poison.

3781
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:38,760
Oh, another sip.

3782
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:39,960
He cures all depression.

3783
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,000
You guys...

3784
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,180
Masked man, your cup's looking a little empty.

3785
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:47,740
You want some?

3786
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:48,600
Yeah, you want some?

3787
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:49,980
You want some more?

3788
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:51,600
I want a drink by myself.

3789
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:53,440
I'll pour it on the TV.

3790
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:55,940
No, Dwayne, will you fucking tell me who you are?

3791
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:56,920
I'm Dwayne.

3792
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,160
The Rock Johnson.

3793
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:01,860
Takes another sip.

3794
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,440
We're so nonchalant.

3795
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:07,340
Yeah, it's like, who are you?

3796
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:09,120
I'm Dwayne.

3797
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:10,700
Hi, I'm Paul.

3798
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:12,100
Oh, there it is.

3799
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:13,360
There's the glass.

3800
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:15,460
Nice, easy.

3801
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:16,380
Nice.

3802
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:18,420
Back-to-back drinking simulator.

3803
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:19,540
Good for my health.

3804
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:23,320
All right, two more.

3805
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:24,220
All right.

3806
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,440
Yippee.

3807
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:27,280
Oh, I'm very drunk right now.

3808
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,540
Maybe you should have done those later.

3809
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:31,460
Yeah.

3810
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,480
Yeah.

3811
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:34,440
Yeah.

3812
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:37,840
How are you going to walk up the ladder?

3813
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:39,460
That's a good question.

3814
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:43,240
Okay, you got this.

3815
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:43,640
Yeah, I got this.

3816
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,720
You're only drunk in the game, doggie.

3817
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,660
Slow and steady.

3818
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,160
Oh, the bed is back.

3819
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:50,780
Yippee.

3820
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:52,860
All right.

3821
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:54,440
Now we have the last two.

3822
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:56,020
All right.

3823
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:58,320
The little mini Easter hunk downstairs.

3824
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,700
Why did they make that one so hard?

3825
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:02,800
What one was that?

3826
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:03,720
What was that one called?

3827
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:06,380
Oh, let's see.

3828
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:08,460
Let me check.

3829
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:10,140
I think it's this one.

3830
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:11,380
Indifference?

3831
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:12,000
Indifference?

3832
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:12,700
Is it indifference?

3833
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:15,120
No, actually, it should be this one.

3834
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:16,200
Pride.

3835
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:16,720
It was pride.

3836
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:17,060
No.

3837
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:20,040
No, pride is the one that's right here by the front door.

3838
02:02:20,440 --> 02:02:21,460
No, it's not prison.

3839
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:22,140
We did that one.

3840
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,840
Oh, then it should be indifference then.

3841
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:27,040
Okay, it's indifference.

3842
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,320
We got one of them eventually.

3843
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:37,220
I think you should put the indifference tape in the thing so we can, like, refer back to it.

3844
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:38,760
No, I mean, like, it doesn't matter.

3845
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:39,580
Like, oh, wait.

3846
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:40,780
Oh, you want to see what it is?

3847
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:41,240
Oh, okay.

3848
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:42,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3849
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:42,560
All right.

3850
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:45,380
Store.

3851
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:47,500
You could probably also get rid of the other ones if you wanted.

3852
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:48,540
Well, I'm putting all of them.

3853
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:49,320
Oh, yeah, that's true.

3854
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:50,240
I mean, this is the last.

3855
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:50,620
Oh, wait.

3856
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:50,860
Whoops.

3857
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:52,120
Not, like, negligence.

3858
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,140
All right.

3859
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:55,640
Okay.

3860
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:58,880
Yeah, the one time I should be drinking, I can't drink.

3861
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:00,300
I know, right?

3862
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:02,280
I can't immerse myself.

3863
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:03,280
How am I getting crazy?

3864
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:05,100
I'm just putting tapes on the TV.

3865
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,940
Okay, I'll just put everything else.

3866
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:09,700
Yeah.

3867
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:10,740
All right.

3868
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:14,720
All right.

3869
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:15,120
Okay.

3870
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:17,960
It shows the door.

3871
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:18,740
Yeah, yeah.

3872
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:20,080
Silent Hill 4.

3873
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:20,860
Uh-huh.

3874
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,240
And then nudist beach.

3875
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:29,820
God, they really wanted to focus on that.

3876
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:30,420
Oh, my God.

3877
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,000
Show us the next scene.

3878
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:33,960
Okay, there's the paintings.

3879
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,020
It's five paintings?

3880
02:03:37,420 --> 02:03:38,540
Six paintings?

3881
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,480
Six paintings.

3882
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:40,740
Okay.

3883
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:43,020
But where do we put the paintings?

3884
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,720
So, I think what we do is we...

3885
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:48,400
Okay.

3886
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:48,720
Oh, yeah.

3887
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:49,880
There was a spiral staircase.

3888
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:53,800
Then what?

3889
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:58,070
Where's that?

3890
02:03:58,370 --> 02:03:59,690
Okay, I know where that is.

3891
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:02,990
And then that's the parents' room.

3892
02:04:03,330 --> 02:04:03,490
Parents' room.

3893
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:03,690
Yeah.

3894
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:05,430
Or the little girls.

3895
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:09,110
I don't know three of this area.

3896
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:09,630
Yeah.

3897
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:10,390
What is that?

3898
02:04:10,710 --> 02:04:12,950
Or that's the TV room.

3899
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:15,330
Okay, well, I just go to the...

3900
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:16,630
Or go to the ones that we do know.

3901
02:04:16,830 --> 02:04:17,010
Okay.

3902
02:04:17,290 --> 02:04:18,150
Parents' room.

3903
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:21,830
Are you sure it was the parents and not the little girls?

3904
02:04:22,290 --> 02:04:22,690
No.

3905
02:04:24,150 --> 02:04:25,710
We can watch it again.

3906
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:27,470
No, it's so long!

3907
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:28,610
Just go, just go.

3908
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:29,630
We can go to either one.

3909
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:31,130
It doesn't matter.

3910
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:32,230
I am not sure.

3911
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:33,230
I'm never sure.

3912
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:34,730
That's my secret.

3913
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:38,350
Just try the parents.

3914
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:38,890
No, I think...

3915
02:04:38,890 --> 02:04:39,710
I think it was the...

3916
02:04:39,710 --> 02:04:40,110
Oh, wait.

3917
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:40,890
No, because...

3918
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:42,110
Wasn't the dresser old?

3919
02:04:42,110 --> 02:04:42,890
This one, right?

3920
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:44,150
Yeah, right there.

3921
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,810
Yeah.

3922
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:45,790
It's right here.

3923
02:04:45,790 --> 02:04:46,310
Oh, that.

3924
02:04:46,530 --> 02:04:46,670
Yeah.

3925
02:04:47,630 --> 02:04:48,630
Okay, we got that.

3926
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:49,410
Where is it placed?

3927
02:04:49,530 --> 02:04:50,950
Oh, it's in my inventory.

3928
02:04:51,110 --> 02:04:51,690
Okay, and then where?

3929
02:04:52,430 --> 02:04:52,830
Okay.

3930
02:04:53,770 --> 02:04:55,850
What was the first one that we saw?

3931
02:04:56,090 --> 02:04:56,790
I don't remember.

3932
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:57,790
I'm going back downstairs.

3933
02:04:58,510 --> 02:04:59,350
Wait, there's another lighter.

3934
02:04:59,630 --> 02:05:00,590
When did I drop this?

3935
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:01,310
Oh.

3936
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:05,530
All right.

3937
02:05:05,710 --> 02:05:07,210
Time to watch our favorite video.

3938
02:05:08,110 --> 02:05:09,070
Okay, hold on.

3939
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:11,890
All right.

3940
02:05:11,930 --> 02:05:12,690
There's the door.

3941
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:14,230
Yeah.

3942
02:05:14,230 --> 02:05:17,950
And then it's going to show us naked people.

3943
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:19,450
Oh, the freezer.

3944
02:05:19,790 --> 02:05:19,910
Yeah.

3945
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:21,990
Okay, but is there anything like up top?

3946
02:05:23,110 --> 02:05:25,530
Like here before I go back downstairs though?

3947
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:27,350
The freezer?

3948
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:28,190
Is it downstairs?

3949
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:28,970
Yeah, there was a freezer.

3950
02:05:28,970 --> 02:05:29,430
Oh, that's right.

3951
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:30,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3952
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:31,070
Yeah.

3953
02:05:31,450 --> 02:05:31,930
The freezer.

3954
02:05:32,330 --> 02:05:32,890
Okay, hold on.

3955
02:05:33,590 --> 02:05:34,230
Let's see.

3956
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:35,290
And there was a...

3957
02:05:35,290 --> 02:05:37,650
I think the chair is in the attic, no?

3958
02:05:37,870 --> 02:05:39,270
Oh, is that the progress room?

3959
02:05:40,730 --> 02:05:41,450
What progress?

3960
02:05:41,650 --> 02:05:41,870
No?

3961
02:05:42,150 --> 02:05:42,430
Wait.

3962
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:43,590
No, the attic?

3963
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:45,070
The one where...

3964
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:46,010
Oh, the...

3965
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:46,810
No, I don't...

3966
02:05:46,810 --> 02:05:48,290
I don't think there's one in the attic.

3967
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:49,470
I think that was the...

3968
02:05:49,470 --> 02:05:50,810
Okay, where the fuck is that?

3969
02:05:50,890 --> 02:05:51,430
What is that?

3970
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:52,630
Okay, there's the freezer.

3971
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:53,330
Okay, the freezer.

3972
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:56,190
That's the parents room with that one.

3973
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:56,590
Yeah.

3974
02:05:57,810 --> 02:05:58,210
That's...

3975
02:05:58,210 --> 02:05:59,130
No, yeah, see, there's got...

3976
02:05:59,130 --> 02:05:59,950
There's Mary.

3977
02:06:00,350 --> 02:06:01,150
That's the attic.

3978
02:06:01,970 --> 02:06:03,390
I don't know where that one is.

3979
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:04,170
That's downstairs.

3980
02:06:04,190 --> 02:06:05,050
That's the basement.

3981
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:07,090
Yeah, okay.

3982
02:06:07,090 --> 02:06:08,390
Okay, so we know two of them.

3983
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:13,010
Don't worry, I'm dual wielding.

3984
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:15,090
Freezer and...

3985
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:17,630
Progress room, is what we know.

3986
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:19,630
Yeah, freezer and progress room.

3987
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:22,590
It's bad that I used up all the candles right away.

3988
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:25,230
I did not realize that they...

3989
02:06:25,230 --> 02:06:27,630
Did you guys know that candles can burn out?

3990
02:06:28,310 --> 02:06:30,710
Wow, Doki not realizing something!

3991
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:35,950
I learned something new today.

3992
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:36,850
Wait, is it the snow?

3993
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:38,490
Where's the...

3994
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:40,490
It was by the chair.

3995
02:06:40,770 --> 02:06:41,230
Oh, there it is.

3996
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:41,830
Oh, there it is.

3997
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:42,230
Okay.

3998
02:06:42,610 --> 02:06:42,850
Alright.

3999
02:06:44,230 --> 02:06:44,610
Okay!

4000
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,490
Alright, what's next?

4001
02:06:46,910 --> 02:06:47,870
There was the freezer.

4002
02:06:48,250 --> 02:06:49,270
Oh, the freezer, yeah.

4003
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:49,950
And then there's...

4004
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:52,810
But then we should figure out where the other ones are before we go back.

4005
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:55,230
There was another one by a plant.

4006
02:06:55,870 --> 02:06:56,570
Where's the plant?

4007
02:06:56,570 --> 02:06:58,550
It was like in a hallway with a plant.

4008
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:01,490
Oh wait, maybe here?

4009
02:07:01,870 --> 02:07:02,570
I don't know.

4010
02:07:03,550 --> 02:07:05,190
There's no paintings here.

4011
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:07,510
Well, it's just a frame.

4012
02:07:07,710 --> 02:07:08,290
It's not a painting.

4013
02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:11,710
Yeah, but it should be like...

4014
02:07:11,710 --> 02:07:12,350
Seeable.

4015
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:17,040
I should be able to take...

4016
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,780
Yeah, I should be able to take one of the candles into Jesus' room.

4017
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:21,920
I know, that...

4018
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:22,100
Yeah.

4019
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:23,500
Yeah, I agree.

4020
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:24,900
Quick save.

4021
02:07:25,060 --> 02:07:25,500
I'm quick...

4022
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:25,940
Yeah, that's right.

4023
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:26,600
I'm quick saving.

4024
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:28,660
She save scumming?

4025
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:29,220
Alright, yeah.

4026
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:29,840
That's...

4027
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,740
It's not save scumming if I don't quick load it every time.

4028
02:07:32,740 --> 02:07:33,400
Alright.

4029
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:33,920
Yeah, okay.

4030
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:35,780
Alright, so...

4031
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:37,120
Is there...

4032
02:07:38,860 --> 02:07:39,840
Is there anything else?

4033
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:41,020
Okay, we got two of...

4034
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:41,740
It's five, right?

4035
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:42,780
So we know where...

4036
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:44,840
We need to figure out what the last one...

4037
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,360
Six of them?

4038
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:46,920
So we need to figure out what the last two are.

4039
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,760
Is those the last two we don't know?

4040
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:52,280
Also, where the fuck do we put these paintings?

4041
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:53,600
What?

4042
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:56,200
What?

4043
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:58,220
The dark ones are tough.

4044
02:07:58,380 --> 02:07:58,500
Yeah.

4045
02:07:58,640 --> 02:07:59,420
I can't see them at all.

4046
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:00,220
I don't know where they are.

4047
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:02,020
Like...

4048
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:03,380
Okay, there's the spiral room.

4049
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:09,160
Okay.

4050
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:10,280
Hello, little boy.

4051
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:11,620
Do you know where the...

4052
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:12,760
Get out of the way, baby.

4053
02:08:13,220 --> 02:08:14,760
I don't know what that is at all.

4054
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:15,220
I don't know what that is.

4055
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:16,120
Chat, what is that?

4056
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:19,160
Chat, what is that?

4057
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:20,420
What is that?

4058
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:21,780
Okay, we got that one.

4059
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:22,600
We got that one.

4060
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:23,960
I don't know what that one is.

4061
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:25,440
Is that the boiler room maybe?

4062
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:26,820
It could be the boiler room.

4063
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:28,620
But that one...

4064
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:29,620
That one is downstairs.

4065
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:30,520
That's the basement.

4066
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:31,880
I know that one's the basement.

4067
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:33,520
I don't know where...

4068
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,920
Well, then you know two that are in the basement, so go get them.

4069
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:36,400
Oh, it's the TV.

4070
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,220
The downstairs TV?

4071
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,900
They said that's the downstairs TV.

4072
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:44,040
Okay, then all three of them is in the basement.

4073
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:47,140
Okay.

4074
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:52,920
Electric room outside of the...

4075
02:08:57,620 --> 02:08:58,120
Mmm...

4076
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:59,100
So down this way?

4077
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:00,340
Oh, there's another candle.

4078
02:09:00,860 --> 02:09:01,420
Oh, nice.

4079
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:05,240
It's here, right?

4080
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:06,600
Yeah, right here.

4081
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:08,360
Oh, right here is the freezer.

4082
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:08,760
Wait, wait, wait, there's one here.

4083
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:09,660
Yeah, yeah.

4084
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:10,480
Yeah, there's that one.

4085
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:11,540
Okay.

4086
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:14,760
And then where's the other one?

4087
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,020
So is that the electric room?

4088
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:20,180
Let's try the electric room.

4089
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:22,600
Doesn't hurt to try again.

4090
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:23,300
Oh, maybe.

4091
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:24,460
Because it's...

4092
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:26,140
I don't see anything here.

4093
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:29,820
I don't see anything.

4094
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:31,480
I don't either.

4095
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:32,580
Try your lighter.

4096
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:33,420
Turn on your light.

4097
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:35,660
What if the...

4098
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:37,000
Go back in with the lighter.

4099
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:39,140
What if the scary man shows up?

4100
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:40,840
Well, you quicksaved.

4101
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:41,340
It's fine.

4102
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:43,060
What if he shows up?

4103
02:09:43,260 --> 02:09:43,960
That doesn't...

4104
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:45,680
Like, he's still gonna kill me.

4105
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:48,160
Yeah, but it's fine.

4106
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:49,640
Opposite of laundry?

4107
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:50,840
Guys, where's the laundry?

4108
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:52,340
I don't...

4109
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:53,260
The laundry.

4110
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:56,480
And the area with chairs opposite of the laundry.

4111
02:09:57,180 --> 02:09:58,500
The laundry was upstairs, no?

4112
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:58,820
The laundry was upstairs, no?

4113
02:09:59,400 --> 02:09:59,740
Wait.

4114
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,560
Electronic room?

4115
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:02,540
Where's the electronic?

4116
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,240
That's the...

4117
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:04,400
Electronic room?

4118
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:04,920
What?

4119
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:07,900
Here, I'm just gonna read the wiki.

4120
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:09,120
What is it?

4121
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:14,760
There is one in the breaker room.

4122
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:15,900
There is one in here.

4123
02:10:16,720 --> 02:10:17,360
I'm blind.

4124
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:20,860
Wait, what if I...

4125
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:24,300
There's a cardboard box and it's leaning on top of it.

4126
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:25,400
Wait.

4127
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:26,820
I'm trying to figure out how to put this.

4128
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:28,420
There we go.

4129
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:29,300
Okay.

4130
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:31,480
Where?

4131
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:33,660
Look down more?

4132
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:35,940
Where?

4133
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,880
Is it leaning against the box?

4134
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:38,420
Where?

4135
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,900
Against the cardboard box.

4136
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:41,320
Where?

4137
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:41,340
Where?

4138
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:46,340
Check behind the door?

4139
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:48,440
No.

4140
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:49,100
No.

4141
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:52,700
It says...

4142
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:54,560
We're looking at the right one?

4143
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:57,640
Step into the breaker room.

4144
02:10:57,860 --> 02:11:00,400
The room to the right as you step out of the freezer room.

4145
02:11:00,540 --> 02:11:04,960
And take the frame leaning against the left side of the cardboard box directly ahead.

4146
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:09,200
There's some black trash bags near the box.

4147
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,700
I'm not blind.

4148
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:15,780
Sir, go...

4149
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:19,020
Look at the box from straight like you're walking into the room.

4150
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:20,660
Maybe.

4151
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:21,660
That will help.

4152
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:23,280
And use your lighter.

4153
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:27,420
So, no.

4154
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:28,480
Not against...

4155
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:30,340
It's by the cardboard boxes!

4156
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:32,220
How many times do I have to say box?

4157
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:34,080
There's 20 of them!

4158
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:35,920
Okay, we'll keep looking!

4159
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:40,830
Do you see it?

4160
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:45,250
I can't see shit because I have 1080p!

4161
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:49,630
Okay, 1080p is actually pretty decent for some people in the world, okay?

4162
02:11:52,350 --> 02:11:56,810
So, people are lucky to even get like 9, like 7, 7, 720p.

4163
02:11:57,170 --> 02:11:58,570
Why aren't you looking down?

4164
02:11:58,930 --> 02:12:01,150
I'm looking at the boxes!

4165
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:06,690
There's like 3 boxes!

4166
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:09,970
How many more boxes do you want me to look at?

4167
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:11,470
Oh.

4168
02:12:13,230 --> 02:12:14,050
He opened the door.

4169
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:14,610
That's rude.

4170
02:12:15,890 --> 02:12:16,550
You did?

4171
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:17,430
No, he did.

4172
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:18,430
Oh.

4173
02:12:19,150 --> 02:12:20,170
He might be coming.

4174
02:12:21,330 --> 02:12:21,710
Whoops.

4175
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:27,500
Um...

4176
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:28,720
Wait, I don't see anything.

4177
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:30,460
Are you sure?

4178
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:34,720
It says in the room with the...

4179
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:36,020
With the...

4180
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:36,800
With the breaker.

4181
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:38,380
I don't know what else to tell you.

4182
02:12:38,940 --> 02:12:40,580
Guys, is she like lying?

4183
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:46,540
I don't know what else to tell you.

4184
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:56,980
I'm literally looking at all the boxes that I could physically look at.

4185
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:04,080
No way, Mint never lies.

4186
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:06,240
Then where are the frames?

4187
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:09,540
It's just one frame.

4188
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:12,160
Okay, Miss Know-It-All.

4189
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:15,840
Actually...

4190
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:18,160
Actually, it's just one frame.

4191
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:19,440
Where is it?

4192
02:13:19,580 --> 02:13:21,880
Where is your stupid one frame?

4193
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:25,920
Leaning against the left side of a cardboard box directly ahead.

4194
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,200
There are some black trash bags near the box.

4195
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:30,680
The last frame...

4196
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:32,440
Wait.

4197
02:13:36,030 --> 02:13:36,390
What?

4198
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:37,310
Oh, never mind.

4199
02:13:37,730 --> 02:13:37,830
No.

4200
02:13:38,330 --> 02:13:38,590
What?

4201
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:39,730
No, it's in here.

4202
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:40,050
Yeah.

4203
02:13:41,630 --> 02:13:42,650
Clearly, it's not.

4204
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:44,670
Clearly, it's not in here.

4205
02:13:45,110 --> 02:13:45,850
It's in here.

4206
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:46,670
Clearly, someone is lying.

4207
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:48,250
It's in here.

4208
02:13:48,850 --> 02:13:51,670
Clearly, I can't see anything in here.

4209
02:13:51,970 --> 02:13:53,530
That implies there's a frame.

4210
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:54,630
Okay.

4211
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:56,170
I don't think you have to get them in a certain order.

4212
02:13:56,170 --> 02:13:57,590
I don't think so either.

4213
02:13:57,750 --> 02:13:58,890
I got all of them at random order.

4214
02:13:59,550 --> 02:13:59,690
Yeah.

4215
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:04,980
I don't...

4216
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:05,500
I don't know.

4217
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:07,080
Okay, pull up a video.

4218
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:09,100
A video?

4219
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:11,980
Pull up a video just to see where the stupid frame is!

4220
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:14,900
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

4221
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:17,340
Just that particular frame!

4222
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:21,420
Wait, someone was like, I see it.

4223
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:22,760
Where do you see this frame?

4224
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:24,220
I think they're...

4225
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:24,960
Wait!

4226
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:25,340
I think...

4227
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:26,600
I think they're lying.

4228
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:32,760
I swear to God, it was never in this room.

4229
02:14:32,860 --> 02:14:34,220
I swear to fucking God.

4230
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:35,840
It says...

4231
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:38,480
Do you want me to screen cap what I see in the guide?

4232
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:39,100
No, no, no, no.

4233
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:42,620
Screen cap the video and...

4234
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:43,720
Hold on.

4235
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:45,860
I'm like on top of the boxes now.

4236
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:47,500
We're on indifference, right?

4237
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:48,360
Okay, yeah, yeah.

4238
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:49,220
Okay, hold on.

4239
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:52,120
This one's really long, so I have to...

4240
02:14:52,120 --> 02:14:54,040
It's in between the boxes?

4241
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:55,420
Which boxes?

4242
02:14:55,700 --> 02:14:56,840
Oh, is it that right there?

4243
02:14:57,640 --> 02:14:58,080
Where?

4244
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:00,580
In between the boxes?

4245
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:02,340
You're just making shit up!

4246
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:06,220
Okay, hold on.

4247
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:06,820
I'm watching them.

4248
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:08,160
I saw them get the first frame.

4249
02:15:12,290 --> 02:15:13,830
Okay, I saw them get this frame.

4250
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:15,190
Oh, I know where that one is.

4251
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:16,350
It's by the cat clock.

4252
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:17,230
Okay.

4253
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:24,620
Which is that one?

4254
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:33,600
Was it never here?

4255
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:34,180
Okay, hold on.

4256
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,140
No, no, no.

4257
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:35,940
Was it never here?

4258
02:15:36,280 --> 02:15:36,760
I'm watching.

4259
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:37,720
Okay, I'm watching.

4260
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:38,200
I'm watching.

4261
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:38,640
I'm watching.

4262
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:38,980
Alright.

4263
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:39,420
Oh my god.

4264
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:41,020
Oh my god.

4265
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:43,160
It's like...

4266
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:44,220
Right there.

4267
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:45,300
It's...

4268
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:47,520
They just walk in and go bloop.

4269
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:48,220
Okay.

4270
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:49,240
Where is it?

4271
02:15:50,020 --> 02:15:51,680
I'm looking at it!

4272
02:15:52,140 --> 02:15:53,880
Did we already grab it?

4273
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:54,960
Check how many you have.

4274
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,460
I have these.

4275
02:15:58,100 --> 02:15:58,540
Three.

4276
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:00,520
Parents?

4277
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:02,160
Okay, click...

4278
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:02,300
Okay.

4279
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:03,760
Click on...

4280
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:05,400
Click on the...

4281
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,100
The box...

4282
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:09,280
That is like...

4283
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:10,060
Okay, your...

4284
02:16:10,060 --> 02:16:10,700
Your cursor...

4285
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:11,460
Okay, down a little.

4286
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:13,540
Just click in between the boxes.

4287
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:15,500
Not that one.

4288
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:17,840
Yeah, like in between these ones.

4289
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,120
There's nothing.

4290
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:20,640
There's nothing.

4291
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:22,680
I'm clicking my heart out.

4292
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,000
I'm gonna send you...

4293
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,800
I'm gonna send you the timestamp, okay?

4294
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:28,620
There's nothing.

4295
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:29,840
I swear to god.

4296
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:31,680
Did that painting glitch out?

4297
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:33,680
I swear to god.

4298
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:34,600
I'm gonna send you the timestamp.

4299
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:35,000
I...

4300
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,720
Where is this?

4301
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:37,800
Look at this.

4302
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:39,120
Where...

4303
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:40,780
Okay, I'm looking at it.

4304
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:44,160
She literally just goes...

4305
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,040
Where is that painting?

4306
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:46,960
I don't see it.

4307
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:47,880
Where is that?

4308
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:48,940
What is that?

4309
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:50,120
We just went...

4310
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:52,020
I can't see it.

4311
02:16:52,640 --> 02:16:53,140
I can't see it.

4312
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:53,540
I can't see it.

4313
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:55,800
Why is that not here with us?

4314
02:16:56,420 --> 02:16:57,180
Like...

4315
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:58,280
There's nothing here.

4316
02:16:58,860 --> 02:16:59,340
I'm...

4317
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:01,180
Yeah, there really isn't.

4318
02:17:01,820 --> 02:17:03,720
Where did our painting go?

4319
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:05,360
Where is it?

4320
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:09,040
It's not where it shows it in the video.

4321
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:10,840
Did you somehow accidentally pick it?

4322
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:11,860
It's right here.

4323
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,060
When did I pick that painting up?

4324
02:17:20,460 --> 02:17:21,540
It's my very...

4325
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:23,680
Oh, it's the very first thing I picked up.

4326
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:25,300
Because it was the first video we watched.

4327
02:17:31,380 --> 02:17:32,420
I forgot.

4328
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:34,420
I forgot we watched that.

4329
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:36,820
That was our first video we watched.

4330
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:41,900
And that was the very first painting we picked up where we discovered this room.

4331
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:42,960
I...

4332
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:47,840
I...

4333
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:52,440
I...

4334
02:17:52,440 --> 02:17:53,540
I...

4335
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:54,180
I...

4336
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:54,740
I...

4337
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:55,120
I...

4338
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:55,220
I...

4339
02:17:55,220 --> 02:17:57,300
Everyone spam that angry guy emoji.

4340
02:17:58,340 --> 02:17:59,180
I...

4341
02:17:59,180 --> 02:17:59,480
Everyone...

4342
02:17:59,480 --> 02:17:59,800
What?

4343
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:02,740
I...

4344
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:08,540
I forgot about it.

4345
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:12,080
Ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

4346
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:15,140
Only one person's mad here, chat's like, lol.

4347
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
No, no, no.

4348
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:20,720
No, no, no!

4349
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:23,320
Okay, anyway, so...

4350
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:24,960
It was never in you!

4351
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:27,340
Oh my god, Minj, do you like to be?

4352
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:29,520
You don't even remember!

4353
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:33,560
You weren't there on stream when I picked it up the very first time!

4354
02:18:33,960 --> 02:18:35,340
You don't even remember!

4355
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:38,000
Go to the storage room.

4356
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,580
You did it.

4357
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:44,060
You forgot about this painting too.

4358
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:46,260
It wasn't just me.

4359
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:48,340
It wasn't just me.

4360
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,280
All I'm saying is you forgot.

4361
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:52,380
I hope he comes and grabs your ass.

4362
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:52,940
No, stop.

4363
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:54,320
I hope the tar man comes.

4364
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:55,600
No, no, tar man.

4365
02:18:55,740 --> 02:18:56,160
The tar man cometh.

4366
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:57,220
Tar man.

4367
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:58,060
Ah.

4368
02:18:58,060 --> 02:18:58,180
Ah.

4369
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:08,420
Did you see like someone did a marriage proposal with that?

4370
02:19:08,720 --> 02:19:09,040
Yes.

4371
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:11,640
I just see that.

4372
02:19:12,820 --> 02:19:13,640
So good.

4373
02:19:14,060 --> 02:19:15,300
Yeah, where do I go next?

4374
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:17,280
I don't know.

4375
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:18,340
You sequins broke.

4376
02:19:18,340 --> 02:19:19,000
Hold on.

4377
02:19:19,260 --> 02:19:19,760
Oh, um.

4378
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:21,380
Uh.

4379
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:24,240
You can go upstairs to the cat clock.

4380
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:26,420
There's one there.

4381
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:29,320
All right.

4382
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:30,640
Upstairs time.

4383
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:34,000
Is that... The last one, I think, is the cat clock one.

4384
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:35,520
Okay, so it's all the way back here.

4385
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:44,260
Champion of the tar.

4386
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:45,640
Uh.

4387
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:46,780
Turn around.

4388
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:48,180
Nope.

4389
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:48,460
Nope.

4390
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:49,020
Don't.

4391
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:49,520
Uh.

4392
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:50,600
Turn around.

4393
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:52,960
Walk.

4394
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:54,920
I'm walking.

4395
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:56,440
Turn to your right.

4396
02:19:57,580 --> 02:19:58,260
Oh, sorry.

4397
02:19:58,420 --> 02:19:58,700
You're left.

4398
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:00,600
Okay.

4399
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:01,980
Someone doesn't know.

4400
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:02,700
Turn to your left.

4401
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:03,820
There it is.

4402
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:04,580
On the wall.

4403
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:05,240
Up.

4404
02:20:05,460 --> 02:20:05,580
Up.

4405
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:06,120
There it is.

4406
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:06,720
This one?

4407
02:20:08,580 --> 02:20:09,320
Which one?

4408
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:11,780
That's the light.

4409
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:15,080
No, I saw it in the video.

4410
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:16,680
What?

4411
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,080
Uh.

4412
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:21,820
There's supposed to be a one around here.

4413
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:22,820
Hold on.

4414
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:24,320
I have one, two, three, four, five.

4415
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:25,440
I have five on me.

4416
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:26,760
Hold on.

4417
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:26,800
One.

4418
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:27,780
Two.

4419
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:28,860
Hold on.

4420
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:29,740
Let me get the...

4421
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:31,460
Hold on.

4422
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:35,560
Did you choose the wrong wall?

4423
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:38,580
Maybe.

4424
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:40,760
Uh.

4425
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,280
There's also one...

4426
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:42,800
Oh, gosh.

4427
02:20:42,860 --> 02:20:43,560
Where is it?

4428
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:44,920
Oh, no.

4429
02:20:44,980 --> 02:20:45,520
It's not there.

4430
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:45,800
Oh.

4431
02:20:45,900 --> 02:20:46,240
Just kidding.

4432
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:50,140
Oh.

4433
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:54,080
Let's get this.

4434
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:54,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4435
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:57,180
Where is the last one?

4436
02:20:57,180 --> 02:20:58,420
On the ground by the chair.

4437
02:20:58,940 --> 02:20:59,980
Which chair?

4438
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:01,620
There's so many chairs.

4439
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:04,040
This guy loves chairs.

4440
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:05,900
I do love chairs.

4441
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:08,760
Come on.

4442
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:10,140
Come on, Blay.

4443
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:13,960
Yes, but also...

4444
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,540
I looked through all the chairs.

4445
02:21:21,360 --> 02:21:22,820
The tar man cometh.

4446
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:24,720
No tar man, don't come over.

4447
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:27,080
I don't wanna pay the toll.

4448
02:21:29,140 --> 02:21:29,960
Okay, hold on.

4449
02:21:30,060 --> 02:21:31,240
So this one is the closet.

4450
02:21:31,460 --> 02:21:32,520
The first one is the closet.

4451
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:34,080
Second one is...

4452
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,360
Oh, wait.

4453
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:38,780
I think I'm a little bit off.

4454
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:39,160
Oh.

4455
02:21:39,580 --> 02:21:44,220
Take the top picture of the potted plant on the small table.

4456
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:44,940
Wait, huh?

4457
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:45,660
What?

4458
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:46,780
No.

4459
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:48,800
I think I'm in the wrong spot.

4460
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:51,580
I was like, what do you mean?

4461
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:55,160
Oh, maybe it's over by the potted plant.

4462
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:57,100
Try over that...

4463
02:21:57,100 --> 02:21:57,920
No, try up the stairs.

4464
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:00,720
Is that any of those?

4465
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:01,140
No.

4466
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:03,140
No.

4467
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:06,520
You're confusing me, Mint.

4468
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:07,720
You're confusing me.

4469
02:22:07,720 --> 02:22:08,620
Go back to the video.

4470
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:10,280
Oh my god.

4471
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:12,440
You can't go back to the video.

4472
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:14,140
I'm controlling the game.

4473
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:14,760
No.

4474
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:17,900
You go to the video in the living room so we can see.

4475
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:19,440
Oh my god.

4476
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:19,740
Okay.

4477
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:21,560
Oh, I know where it is.

4478
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:21,900
Sorry.

4479
02:22:21,980 --> 02:22:22,300
Go back.

4480
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:24,220
I was right...

4481
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:25,000
Kind of.

4482
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:25,500
Turn around.

4483
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:25,900
Turn around.

4484
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:26,800
Okay.

4485
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:27,820
What the...

4486
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:28,840
Why is the question mark there?

4487
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:30,060
Oh, it's the tar man.

4488
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:30,800
You interact.

4489
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:31,200
Yeah.

4490
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:33,660
Go into the room right there on your left.

4491
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:34,080
Yeah.

4492
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:35,160
And there.

4493
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:35,640
See?

4494
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:35,840
We...

4495
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:37,180
Oh my god.

4496
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:38,520
Up...

4497
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:39,160
The...

4498
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:39,880
That one.

4499
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:40,680
Oh, there it is.

4500
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:41,520
Oh.

4501
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:43,640
Yeah.

4502
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:44,460
All right.

4503
02:22:44,540 --> 02:22:45,860
And then what do we do with the paintings?

4504
02:22:51,930 --> 02:22:52,410
Um...

4505
02:22:53,490 --> 02:22:53,970
Um...

4506
02:22:55,470 --> 02:22:56,390
Where do we go?

4507
02:22:56,610 --> 02:23:01,430
Take all the strange frames with you over to the stairs that go up to the kitchen stairway.

4508
02:23:02,250 --> 02:23:04,610
Go up to the kitchen stairway?

4509
02:23:05,630 --> 02:23:06,030
Okay.

4510
02:23:06,190 --> 02:23:06,610
And then what?

4511
02:23:08,030 --> 02:23:08,690
Like, uh...

4512
02:23:08,690 --> 02:23:09,510
The one in the basement.

4513
02:23:09,770 --> 02:23:10,110
Remember?

4514
02:23:11,010 --> 02:23:11,810
Like that...

4515
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:14,190
That stairway in the basement that you have to go to?

4516
02:23:14,370 --> 02:23:14,390
This one?

4517
02:23:14,490 --> 02:23:15,010
This the kitchen?

4518
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:16,010
There's the kitchen here.

4519
02:23:17,230 --> 02:23:17,630
Uh...

4520
02:23:17,630 --> 02:23:19,150
Maybe you can go to it from...

4521
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:20,050
The other way.

4522
02:23:20,170 --> 02:23:21,790
Like, uh...

4523
02:23:21,790 --> 02:23:22,150
You know.

4524
02:23:22,350 --> 02:23:22,750
Yeah.

4525
02:23:22,790 --> 02:23:23,330
Right in there.

4526
02:23:23,490 --> 02:23:24,470
He's not helping.

4527
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:25,770
No, no.

4528
02:23:25,870 --> 02:23:26,210
Turn around.

4529
02:23:26,350 --> 02:23:27,070
Go through that door.

4530
02:23:27,250 --> 02:23:27,450
No.

4531
02:23:27,490 --> 02:23:28,330
There's another one here.

4532
02:23:29,950 --> 02:23:31,250
This kitchen stairway?

4533
02:23:33,590 --> 02:23:34,490
Should be, yeah.

4534
02:23:35,410 --> 02:23:35,710
Okay.

4535
02:23:36,810 --> 02:23:37,570
So there...

4536
02:23:37,570 --> 02:23:40,310
It says that there should be some place to place the frames at.

4537
02:23:41,090 --> 02:23:42,890
Oh, I think you can s...

4538
02:23:42,890 --> 02:23:43,910
Is it like...

4539
02:23:48,290 --> 02:23:48,570
There?

4540
02:23:49,310 --> 02:23:52,530
Before getting on the stairs, move over the wall and...

4541
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:53,970
Ugh!

4542
02:23:54,190 --> 02:23:56,410
There are marks on the wall where frames should go.

4543
02:23:56,610 --> 02:23:57,210
It says!

4544
02:23:57,470 --> 02:23:59,030
Before you get on the stairs, in the basement!

4545
02:24:00,110 --> 02:24:01,570
There's no frames anywhere.

4546
02:24:01,570 --> 02:24:04,310
I say the basement and she keeps going upstairs, you guys.

4547
02:24:04,550 --> 02:24:04,950
Okay.

4548
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:05,870
Okay.

4549
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:07,150
I'm in the basement.

4550
02:24:09,670 --> 02:24:10,610
Is it this?

4551
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:11,130
Is that...

4552
02:24:11,130 --> 02:24:11,950
Are those the markings?

4553
02:24:14,430 --> 02:24:16,710
Is that supposed to represent the painting?

4554
02:24:16,930 --> 02:24:17,670
Where the paintings go?

4555
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:17,830
No.

4556
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:25,540
That's the...

4557
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:26,280
Other side.

4558
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:31,110
On that side, maybe?

4559
02:24:32,150 --> 02:24:32,570
Oh.

4560
02:24:33,010 --> 02:24:33,430
No.

4561
02:24:33,430 --> 02:24:34,850
No, this is the...

4562
02:24:34,850 --> 02:24:35,290
Uh-oh.

4563
02:24:35,650 --> 02:24:36,050
It's fine.

4564
02:24:36,050 --> 02:24:37,470
I have multiple letters.

4565
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:39,790
No.

4566
02:24:39,790 --> 02:24:40,210
No.

4567
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:40,790
I'm gonna...

4568
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:41,670
I'm gonna say...

4569
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:43,870
I'm gonna just read it out for you, word for word.

4570
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:44,790
Okay.

4571
02:24:44,810 --> 02:24:46,250
How's that gonna help me?

4572
02:24:47,650 --> 02:24:50,650
Because maybe you can have a thought, for once.

4573
02:24:51,970 --> 02:24:52,650
I don't...

4574
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:53,890
But I'm not...

4575
02:24:54,710 --> 02:24:55,570
I'm not what?

4576
02:24:55,790 --> 02:24:55,850
I'm not what?

4577
02:24:55,850 --> 02:24:58,770
I don't know how to have independent thought.

4578
02:25:00,110 --> 02:25:03,970
Take all the frames with you over to the stairs that go up to the kitchen...

4579
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:06,010
Slash stairway.

4580
02:25:06,250 --> 02:25:09,810
And before getting on the stairs, move over to the wall...

4581
02:25:09,810 --> 02:25:12,690
To the right of the bottom of the stairs in the basement.

4582
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:15,790
There are marks on the wall where some frames should go.

4583
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:17,270
What?

4584
02:25:17,770 --> 02:25:19,610
So go back to where we were.

4585
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:22,150
Where I told you to go.

4586
02:25:22,750 --> 02:25:23,270
What?

4587
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:26,170
That makes no sense.

4588
02:25:28,250 --> 02:25:29,370
Where are you going?

4589
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:30,090
Turn around!

4590
02:25:30,330 --> 02:25:31,270
Just go in the basement!

4591
02:25:31,730 --> 02:25:32,230
This is...

4592
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:33,450
This is the basement.

4593
02:25:34,650 --> 02:25:35,950
Why are you going upstairs?

4594
02:25:36,190 --> 02:25:37,630
We gotta stay in the downstairs.

4595
02:25:38,070 --> 02:25:38,970
I'm downstairs!

4596
02:25:40,190 --> 02:25:40,750
Yeah!

4597
02:25:41,090 --> 02:25:42,290
Oh my god!

4598
02:25:42,650 --> 02:25:44,510
Why do you want me to go?!

4599
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:48,920
In here!

4600
02:25:49,180 --> 02:25:49,560
In here!

4601
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:50,140
Go back.

4602
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:50,660
Yes.

4603
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:53,720
Okay.

4604
02:25:53,820 --> 02:25:55,340
It's somewhere around here.

4605
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:56,640
It's somewhere around here.

4606
02:25:58,180 --> 02:25:59,060
It's somewhere around here.

4607
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:00,580
Can you move anything?

4608
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:01,680
Like, uh...

4609
02:26:04,100 --> 02:26:05,560
It says I can't use it!

4610
02:26:10,710 --> 02:26:12,610
I don't know where it is, where it goes.

4611
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:14,650
I'm literally just telling you where it tells me though.

4612
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:15,390
Oh my god.

4613
02:26:16,350 --> 02:26:17,310
I don't know!

4614
02:26:17,990 --> 02:26:19,830
Yeah, can you like interact with the wall?

4615
02:26:19,970 --> 02:26:20,830
Maybe can you move?

4616
02:26:20,870 --> 02:26:22,650
No, no, no, I can't!

4617
02:26:22,830 --> 02:26:23,710
I'm touching everything!

4618
02:26:26,570 --> 02:26:28,890
God, you're so... You're a bad guy!

4619
02:26:29,370 --> 02:26:30,750
I didn't stop it!

4620
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:33,970
Try moving that plank of wood.

4621
02:26:34,110 --> 02:26:34,810
Can you move that plank of wood?

4622
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:35,150
No!

4623
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:37,590
No, I'm touching everything!

4624
02:26:37,990 --> 02:26:38,170
What about that?

4625
02:26:38,650 --> 02:26:39,490
It's a candle!

4626
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:40,690
I'll put a candle there.

4627
02:26:41,250 --> 02:26:42,270
Yeah, put a candle there.

4628
02:26:42,870 --> 02:26:44,190
While we figure this out!

4629
02:26:47,270 --> 02:26:48,430
Turn right there.

4630
02:26:48,730 --> 02:26:51,370
You can't put anything on the wall right there.

4631
02:26:54,350 --> 02:26:55,770
On the other side of the wall.

4632
02:26:56,010 --> 02:26:56,730
Like, behind you.

4633
02:26:57,930 --> 02:26:58,450
No.

4634
02:26:58,730 --> 02:26:59,450
Where you put the candle at?

4635
02:26:59,550 --> 02:27:00,390
Where you put the candle at?

4636
02:27:06,210 --> 02:27:08,570
The correct wall is striped.

4637
02:27:09,310 --> 02:27:09,430
What?

4638
02:27:10,370 --> 02:27:12,030
Did we see a striped wall?

4639
02:27:13,410 --> 02:27:14,410
I don't know.

4640
02:27:14,850 --> 02:27:16,890
I don't know.

4641
02:27:17,390 --> 02:27:18,510
I'm so lost.

4642
02:27:19,690 --> 02:27:20,550
Where do we go?

4643
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:21,570
The other stairs?

4644
02:27:21,750 --> 02:27:22,890
What other stairs are there?

4645
02:27:22,910 --> 02:27:23,030
The other one?

4646
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:24,350
I wanted to go down!

4647
02:27:24,530 --> 02:27:25,750
You yelled at me!

4648
02:27:26,730 --> 02:27:29,370
You're like, no, it's not that one.

4649
02:27:29,590 --> 02:27:30,430
This one!

4650
02:27:31,750 --> 02:27:32,990
Oh, yeah, here.

4651
02:27:32,990 --> 02:27:33,370
Oh, my God.

4652
02:27:33,830 --> 02:27:34,810
Oh, my God!

4653
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:36,450
You yelled at me for this!

4654
02:27:40,930 --> 02:27:42,850
Oh, my God.

4655
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:46,510
You're like, it's not this one, Doki!

4656
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:49,210
Go back to the other stairs!

4657
02:27:49,250 --> 02:27:49,310
It's safe!

4658
02:27:49,310 --> 02:27:49,630
It's safe!

4659
02:27:50,050 --> 02:27:53,170
Go back to the other stairs, Doki!

4660
02:27:53,690 --> 02:27:55,610
It's not that one!

4661
02:27:56,090 --> 02:27:57,930
It's a bad guide, everybody!

4662
02:27:58,130 --> 02:27:59,730
Everybody is a bad guide!

4663
02:28:00,290 --> 02:28:02,330
I was like, is it this one?

4664
02:28:02,590 --> 02:28:03,550
They're like, no!

4665
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:05,450
Go back to the other one!

4666
02:28:05,950 --> 02:28:06,010
I didn't know!

4667
02:28:06,010 --> 02:28:08,510
Okay, to be fair, I didn't know that one led to the kitchen.

4668
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:16,270
I didn't know that would lead to the kitchen.

4669
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:19,590
Oh, take that pill.

4670
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:21,110
Oh, take that funny pill.

4671
02:28:21,630 --> 02:28:21,970
Which one will you take?

4672
02:28:21,970 --> 02:28:24,130
Wait, you can take the red pill or you take the blue pill.

4673
02:28:24,130 --> 02:28:25,390
Which pill will you... Oh, wait.

4674
02:28:25,750 --> 02:28:27,810
Remember when you said I'm also a druggie?

4675
02:28:28,570 --> 02:28:29,150
Oh, yeah.

4676
02:28:29,410 --> 02:28:30,450
Oh, you have to take all of them.

4677
02:28:31,210 --> 02:28:31,990
Proving them right.

4678
02:28:32,390 --> 02:28:32,730
Let's go.

4679
02:28:33,810 --> 02:28:35,150
I don't have a problem.

4680
02:28:35,390 --> 02:28:36,930
Life just made me this way.

4681
02:28:38,690 --> 02:28:39,750
All right.

4682
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:43,370
Finally, I won't hear her voice anymore.

4683
02:28:43,810 --> 02:28:44,010
Green pill.

4684
02:28:45,850 --> 02:28:47,530
Take the green pill.

4685
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:48,450
Doki, can you hear me?

4686
02:28:48,890 --> 02:28:51,250
Doki, it's the other wall.

4687
02:28:52,010 --> 02:28:54,510
Doki, Doki, you have to listen to me.

4688
02:28:55,810 --> 02:28:58,150
Finally, the voices I got.

4689
02:28:58,670 --> 02:28:59,890
Thank God.

4690
02:29:01,210 --> 02:29:01,850
Yeah.

4691
02:29:07,930 --> 02:29:08,750
Oh, no.

4692
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:10,010
That's where chat goes.

4693
02:29:10,110 --> 02:29:10,810
Goodbye, chat.

4694
02:29:12,510 --> 02:29:13,230
All right.

4695
02:29:13,450 --> 02:29:14,130
Open the door.

4696
02:29:16,650 --> 02:29:18,290
Hey, why can't I go through?

4697
02:29:19,050 --> 02:29:20,630
The meds don't work anymore.

4698
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:21,410
No!

4699
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:22,770
I hear her!

4700
02:29:26,570 --> 02:29:27,890
They lied!

4701
02:29:29,010 --> 02:29:31,210
And I can't even save!

4702
02:29:32,090 --> 02:29:32,830
Uh-oh.

4703
02:29:32,950 --> 02:29:33,430
Uh-oh.

4704
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:34,330
Oh.

4705
02:29:34,490 --> 02:29:35,490
Oh, hey, he's painting.

4706
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:37,170
That is so bad.

4707
02:29:37,450 --> 02:29:37,530
He's an artist.

4708
02:29:39,370 --> 02:29:40,050
Oh.

4709
02:29:40,050 --> 02:29:40,730
Okay.

4710
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:42,590
Was that supposed to be scary?

4711
02:29:43,170 --> 02:29:43,850
Maybe.

4712
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:43,970
Maybe.

4713
02:29:45,510 --> 02:29:46,370
Oh, what's this?

4714
02:29:46,530 --> 02:29:47,270
It's just water.

4715
02:29:47,530 --> 02:29:47,530
Drink the water.

4716
02:29:47,770 --> 02:29:48,190
I can't.

4717
02:29:48,490 --> 02:29:49,830
He won't let me drink the water.

4718
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:50,750
No.

4719
02:29:51,970 --> 02:29:53,130
What does it let you do?

4720
02:29:53,370 --> 02:29:53,750
Nothing?

4721
02:29:53,930 --> 02:29:54,330
Nothing.

4722
02:29:54,570 --> 02:29:55,730
I can look at the water.

4723
02:29:56,550 --> 02:29:56,810
Okay.

4724
02:29:57,090 --> 02:29:58,210
Continue onward, I guess.

4725
02:29:58,450 --> 02:29:58,610
Okay.

4726
02:29:59,330 --> 02:30:00,730
He's not done with his art.

4727
02:30:00,910 --> 02:30:01,510
No peeking.

4728
02:30:02,030 --> 02:30:02,510
Oh.

4729
02:30:02,610 --> 02:30:03,530
Oh, it's just pills.

4730
02:30:03,990 --> 02:30:04,650
More pills.

4731
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:05,390
Pills you.

4732
02:30:05,550 --> 02:30:05,970
Pills here.

4733
02:30:07,210 --> 02:30:07,830
All right.

4734
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:08,890
Okay.

4735
02:30:08,890 --> 02:30:09,810
Last door.

4736
02:30:10,570 --> 02:30:11,470
Last door.

4737
02:30:11,790 --> 02:30:12,910
Oh, it's a fake door.

4738
02:30:13,410 --> 02:30:14,130
Just kidding.

4739
02:30:16,590 --> 02:30:17,430
Oh, okay.

4740
02:30:18,850 --> 02:30:20,370
I like how one door is just water.

4741
02:30:20,550 --> 02:30:21,230
Stay hydrated.

4742
02:30:22,010 --> 02:30:22,490
Oh, grief.

4743
02:30:22,810 --> 02:30:23,310
Solace.

4744
02:30:23,490 --> 02:30:23,910
Depression.

4745
02:30:24,330 --> 02:30:24,850
Anxiety.

4746
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:25,930
Oh, hey, I'm trauma dumping.

4747
02:30:26,410 --> 02:30:26,870
Give me a sec.

4748
02:30:29,230 --> 02:30:30,210
One moment.

4749
02:30:30,370 --> 02:30:31,870
Let me tell you guys everything.

4750
02:30:32,350 --> 02:30:34,710
Let me tell you guys all the baggage I have.

4751
02:30:35,530 --> 02:30:37,050
That's why I'm a VTuber.

4752
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:39,670
Soul.

4753
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:40,030
What?

4754
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:40,930
Soulless.

4755
02:30:41,190 --> 02:30:41,710
Hatred.

4756
02:30:42,070 --> 02:30:42,350
Hatred.

4757
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:43,590
Depression.

4758
02:30:45,050 --> 02:30:45,770
Sorry.

4759
02:30:46,710 --> 02:30:47,290
Hatred.

4760
02:30:47,970 --> 02:30:50,210
So, when I was a kid...

4761
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:52,250
Oh, my God.

4762
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:53,890
What's happening?

4763
02:30:54,390 --> 02:30:55,490
Is everything okay?

4764
02:30:55,990 --> 02:30:57,150
What's going on?

4765
02:30:57,370 --> 02:30:58,210
They're in the mines.

4766
02:30:58,390 --> 02:30:59,110
They're in the mines.

4767
02:30:59,270 --> 02:30:59,890
Oh, my God.

4768
02:31:01,550 --> 02:31:02,630
Look, guys.

4769
02:31:03,010 --> 02:31:05,270
Aren't you all great to be mining?

4770
02:31:05,990 --> 02:31:07,770
We're mining and crafting.

4771
02:31:07,770 --> 02:31:08,950
That's Minecraft.

4772
02:31:09,050 --> 02:31:09,850
Mining and crafting.

4773
02:31:11,810 --> 02:31:12,690
What about that guy?

4774
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:12,910
Whoa.

4775
02:31:14,290 --> 02:31:15,830
He's sniffing out the mines.

4776
02:31:16,150 --> 02:31:18,130
He's sniffing out the diamonds right now.

4777
02:31:18,610 --> 02:31:19,190
Yeah, he can smell diamonds.

4778
02:31:19,190 --> 02:31:21,030
Yeah, you know how, like, pigs who can smell truffles?

4779
02:31:21,810 --> 02:31:21,990
Oh.

4780
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:23,990
He's smelling the diamonds right now.

4781
02:31:24,470 --> 02:31:24,870
Oh.

4782
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:26,170
This guy just has trauma.

4783
02:31:28,870 --> 02:31:32,390
Like, I saw the Minecraft movie and got chicken jockeyed.

4784
02:31:32,830 --> 02:31:33,030
Yeah.

4785
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:33,950
He's like, no.

4786
02:31:34,370 --> 02:31:36,110
Not chicken jockey.

4787
02:31:38,750 --> 02:31:40,510
He's, like, one of the theater workers.

4788
02:31:40,770 --> 02:31:45,430
Like, he hears chicken jockey for the thousandth time and that's his breaking point.

4789
02:31:47,370 --> 02:31:51,670
They keep saying chicken jockey, but I don't understand.

4790
02:31:52,510 --> 02:31:53,690
Why is it funny?

4791
02:31:53,690 --> 02:31:54,290
Why is it funny?

4792
02:31:56,270 --> 02:31:57,750
Flint and steel.

4793
02:31:58,490 --> 02:32:00,190
Oh, I need both hands.

4794
02:32:00,490 --> 02:32:00,790
Okay.

4795
02:32:00,790 --> 02:32:03,530
Let me put my lighter away, apparently.

4796
02:32:04,450 --> 02:32:04,730
Whoa.

4797
02:32:06,050 --> 02:32:06,270
Row.

4798
02:32:06,270 --> 02:32:07,590
We're on the river sticks.

4799
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:11,010
Row, row, row, your boat.

4800
02:32:11,070 --> 02:32:11,670
Your boat.

4801
02:32:12,190 --> 02:32:13,830
Gently down the stream.

4802
02:32:15,210 --> 02:32:16,130
Merrily, merrily.

4803
02:32:16,210 --> 02:32:17,330
Wait, how does it go again?

4804
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:19,270
Merrily, merrily.

4805
02:32:19,630 --> 02:32:21,510
Life is but a dream.

4806
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:23,190
I think that's how it is.

4807
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:23,770
I forgot.

4808
02:32:24,210 --> 02:32:25,410
It's been a while since I sang that song.

4809
02:32:25,410 --> 02:32:27,210
Do you go to the red, or where do you go?

4810
02:32:27,250 --> 02:32:27,570
Oh, look.

4811
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:29,510
She's holding his TV for him.

4812
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:30,210
What a good way.

4813
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:30,790
Oh, wow.

4814
02:32:31,250 --> 02:32:32,790
He's watching TV in the water.

4815
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:33,950
What a good...

4816
02:32:33,950 --> 02:32:34,750
Drop the TV.

4817
02:32:35,390 --> 02:32:36,370
That should be us.

4818
02:32:36,550 --> 02:32:37,230
That should be us.

4819
02:32:37,430 --> 02:32:38,670
I'll be the one holding the TV.

4820
02:32:39,350 --> 02:32:40,830
He is having a hoot and a holler.

4821
02:32:41,130 --> 02:32:41,930
Oh, my God.

4822
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:44,130
She's only wearing her bra, too.

4823
02:32:44,130 --> 02:32:46,790
It's like that ninja tweet where like...

4824
02:32:46,790 --> 02:32:48,470
Oh, yeah, but she's wearing a bra.

4825
02:32:48,610 --> 02:32:50,950
You know that ninja tweet where like, I'm living the life.

4826
02:32:51,050 --> 02:32:53,870
My wife just came in without a bra giving me a sandwich.

4827
02:32:54,970 --> 02:32:55,410
What?

4828
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:58,390
Hey, you never saw that tweet?

4829
02:32:59,150 --> 02:32:59,530
No.

4830
02:32:59,530 --> 02:33:00,090
I don't think so.

4831
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:02,450
Yeah, like ninja was like, I'm living the good life.

4832
02:33:02,630 --> 02:33:05,650
My wife just came in without a bra giving me a sandwich.

4833
02:33:05,650 --> 02:33:08,490
As like, um, and that was like a...

4834
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:11,470
And like, they're like, I'm here to own the haters.

4835
02:33:12,170 --> 02:33:12,650
Oh.

4836
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:14,930
Oh.

4837
02:33:15,410 --> 02:33:15,810
Alright.

4838
02:33:17,030 --> 02:33:17,550
What?

4839
02:33:17,550 --> 02:33:17,830
What?

4840
02:33:17,830 --> 02:33:19,110
We're just watching this guy.

4841
02:33:20,430 --> 02:33:21,810
Is this YouTube friendly?

4842
02:33:22,970 --> 02:33:23,950
I don't know.

4843
02:33:24,330 --> 02:33:24,350
Don't worry about it.

4844
02:33:24,350 --> 02:33:26,770
I've been watching this like, last...

4845
02:33:26,770 --> 02:33:28,610
For a while now.

4846
02:33:29,050 --> 02:33:31,070
I was like, did I be watching that?

4847
02:33:31,150 --> 02:33:31,910
Do you go towards the big red brain?

4848
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:32,750
Where do you go?

4849
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:33,410
Oh, over here.

4850
02:33:33,950 --> 02:33:35,190
Oh, there is a big...

4851
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:36,010
Oh, it's like an apple.

4852
02:33:37,150 --> 02:33:37,670
Apple.

4853
02:33:38,110 --> 02:33:39,330
Oh, is that what that is?

4854
02:33:39,470 --> 02:33:39,610
Yeah.

4855
02:33:40,010 --> 02:33:40,670
It's, it's Defno.

4856
02:33:40,910 --> 02:33:41,230
Oh, yeah.

4857
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:42,670
Defno.

4858
02:33:43,810 --> 02:33:44,970
Oh, it's Persona!

4859
02:33:45,150 --> 02:33:46,450
He's, he's doing Persona!

4860
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:47,770
Persona!

4861
02:33:50,130 --> 02:33:52,970
He's summoning his like, sand or whatever it's called.

4862
02:33:53,870 --> 02:33:54,630
His stand.

4863
02:33:54,650 --> 02:33:55,390
I don't know.

4864
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:56,470
I've never played Persona.

4865
02:33:56,490 --> 02:33:57,930
I've never played Persona.

4866
02:34:01,310 --> 02:34:03,710
Can you tell I've never played Persona before?

4867
02:34:04,750 --> 02:34:05,970
I can't get up the stairs.

4868
02:34:06,050 --> 02:34:06,650
Oh, there it is.

4869
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:08,170
It like, blocked me a little.

4870
02:34:09,170 --> 02:34:10,930
It's called a Persona.

4871
02:34:11,070 --> 02:34:13,690
Wait, is that why the game is called Persona?

4872
02:34:16,590 --> 02:34:18,550
You didn't even know, Mint.

4873
02:34:18,730 --> 02:34:19,930
You didn't know.

4874
02:34:20,410 --> 02:34:21,670
I've never played Persona.

4875
02:34:21,810 --> 02:34:22,370
Yeah, see?

4876
02:34:22,690 --> 02:34:23,690
Mint is also...

4877
02:34:23,690 --> 02:34:25,130
But I know it's not called a stand.

4878
02:34:25,490 --> 02:34:25,950
I know that.

4879
02:34:26,250 --> 02:34:27,950
Mint also didn't know.

4880
02:34:28,610 --> 02:34:29,430
I know it's not a stand.

4881
02:34:29,430 --> 02:34:30,830
She's part of the problem.

4882
02:34:32,430 --> 02:34:33,930
Definitely not part of the solution.

4883
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:34,450
Yeah.

4884
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:37,010
This game cannot save manually if needed.

4885
02:34:37,370 --> 02:34:38,810
Oh, it's my best friend.

4886
02:34:39,150 --> 02:34:40,690
I was waiting for you impatiently.

4887
02:34:41,570 --> 02:34:42,130
What?

4888
02:34:42,130 --> 02:34:44,350
You told me this isn't your domain.

4889
02:34:44,970 --> 02:34:45,530
Nonsense.

4890
02:34:45,630 --> 02:34:46,190
What?

4891
02:34:46,190 --> 02:34:48,030
It's the fruit of your hard labor.

4892
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:51,450
Can't you see how everyone enjoys their time here?

4893
02:34:51,750 --> 02:34:52,950
I'm a great time.

4894
02:34:53,210 --> 02:34:54,530
They have this newfound home.

4895
02:34:54,670 --> 02:34:56,270
Meow meow meow meow.

4896
02:34:57,550 --> 02:35:00,010
Some of them might look a little lost.

4897
02:35:00,010 --> 02:35:00,770
I concur.

4898
02:35:01,230 --> 02:35:01,910
But what of it?

4899
02:35:02,010 --> 02:35:04,790
They have a place to be for all of eternity.

4900
02:35:05,090 --> 02:35:05,730
Oh, yeah.

4901
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:08,570
I took my kids and my wife to heaven.

4902
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:10,510
The dead will whisper.

4903
02:35:10,510 --> 02:35:11,150
Yeah, yeah.

4904
02:35:12,050 --> 02:35:14,090
And I will be there with them.

4905
02:35:14,370 --> 02:35:15,850
Because I've done good deeds.

4906
02:35:16,410 --> 02:35:16,610
Yeah.

4907
02:35:16,950 --> 02:35:18,930
Have a look at your masterpiece.

4908
02:35:19,370 --> 02:35:20,690
I raptured them myself.

4909
02:35:22,110 --> 02:35:22,470
Oh.

4910
02:35:22,930 --> 02:35:23,190
Oh.

4911
02:35:23,190 --> 02:35:23,230
Okay.

4912
02:35:23,330 --> 02:35:24,810
Okay, our masterpiece.

4913
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:26,330
Oh, yippee.

4914
02:35:26,810 --> 02:35:27,630
Oh, so I get to...

4915
02:35:27,630 --> 02:35:28,230
You're an artiste.

4916
02:35:28,350 --> 02:35:29,450
Go up the long, long...

4917
02:35:29,450 --> 02:35:30,530
Can you run up these?

4918
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:31,790
Or...

4919
02:35:31,790 --> 02:35:32,290
No.

4920
02:35:32,890 --> 02:35:33,890
This is me running.

4921
02:35:35,350 --> 02:35:35,870
Okay.

4922
02:35:35,870 --> 02:35:37,110
Oh, so like...

4923
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:38,170
I have to go look through each window?

4924
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:39,870
No?

4925
02:35:39,990 --> 02:35:40,890
Oh, I just have to go up.

4926
02:35:41,330 --> 02:35:41,650
Might be a...

4927
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:42,650
Might be a lengthy journey.

4928
02:35:43,310 --> 02:35:44,110
Oh my god.

4929
02:35:44,350 --> 02:35:45,730
Gotta get my cardio up.

4930
02:35:46,190 --> 02:35:46,450
Yeah.

4931
02:35:46,830 --> 02:35:48,510
Have you ever been up a lighthouse before?

4932
02:35:48,650 --> 02:35:49,310
No, I haven't.

4933
02:35:49,430 --> 02:35:49,750
Have you?

4934
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:50,110
Me?

4935
02:35:50,390 --> 02:35:50,650
No.

4936
02:35:50,650 --> 02:35:50,830
Oh.

4937
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:54,570
The only thing I know about lighthouses is from the...

4938
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:55,250
Uh...

4939
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:56,130
What's his name?

4940
02:35:56,830 --> 02:35:57,230
Um...

4941
02:35:57,230 --> 02:35:58,110
The spiral man.

4942
02:35:58,850 --> 02:36:00,070
You know that guy, the writer?

4943
02:36:00,430 --> 02:36:00,530
Uzumaki?

4944
02:36:00,790 --> 02:36:01,190
Uzumaki.

4945
02:36:01,330 --> 02:36:01,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4946
02:36:01,850 --> 02:36:03,330
That's the only thing I know about lighthouses.

4947
02:36:04,050 --> 02:36:04,290
Oh.

4948
02:36:04,730 --> 02:36:05,530
It can kill.

4949
02:36:07,590 --> 02:36:08,670
Oh, I'm up here.

4950
02:36:08,910 --> 02:36:09,870
Oh, there's lots of candles.

4951
02:36:10,030 --> 02:36:11,150
I can't go crazy now.

4952
02:36:12,090 --> 02:36:12,830
Go grab one.

4953
02:36:12,930 --> 02:36:13,270
Grab one.

4954
02:36:14,430 --> 02:36:14,830
No.

4955
02:36:16,690 --> 02:36:17,970
Oh, there's another candle.

4956
02:36:18,230 --> 02:36:19,910
Is that my beautiful wife that I killed?

4957
02:36:21,070 --> 02:36:22,010
Oh, my God.

4958
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:23,030
Oh, my God.

4959
02:36:23,770 --> 02:36:24,310
Oh, my God.

4960
02:36:24,310 --> 02:36:25,450
Hello, my beautiful wife.

4961
02:36:26,110 --> 02:36:27,110
Where's the beer can?

4962
02:36:27,650 --> 02:36:28,570
Yeah, we're...

4963
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:34,420
Oh, look.

4964
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:35,140
It's so romantic.

4965
02:36:35,360 --> 02:36:37,380
It gave us romantic music along the line.

4966
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:38,400
Whoa.

4967
02:36:38,980 --> 02:36:40,960
It's not a scary game anymore.

4968
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:43,500
I think it's supposed to be more somber.

4969
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:44,520
Like...

4970
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:46,220
Oh, that's my wife.

4971
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:47,020
She was so beautiful.

4972
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:48,060
I killed her.

4973
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:49,820
I'll see her in heaven, doll.

4974
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:51,560
No.

4975
02:36:52,340 --> 02:36:54,020
I'm gonna go to heaven, guys.

4976
02:36:55,100 --> 02:36:56,580
Cats have nine lives.

4977
02:36:58,580 --> 02:36:59,140
What's this?

4978
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:00,120
All cats go to heaven.

4979
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:00,540
Yeah.

4980
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:03,520
Stress build.

4981
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:06,300
Stress build.

4982
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:08,560
What's that?

4983
02:37:08,780 --> 02:37:09,060
Prevents.

4984
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:11,000
Prevents stress build.

4985
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:12,600
Oh, prevent stress.

4986
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:12,940
Oh, my God.

4987
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:14,080
There's my address, guys.

4988
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:15,400
Oh.

4989
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:17,180
Don't go to our house.

4990
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:20,960
And definitely don't report us to the police.

4991
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:22,140
Oh, my God.

4992
02:37:22,320 --> 02:37:23,540
I didn't do anything bad.

4993
02:37:24,140 --> 02:37:24,800
Explain this to me.

4994
02:37:24,940 --> 02:37:25,040
Oh.

4995
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:25,960
Oh, there's my wife.

4996
02:37:26,860 --> 02:37:27,980
Please talk to me.

4997
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:28,520
Hello.

4998
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:29,540
What do you mean explain?

4999
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:30,760
I wanna help you.

5000
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:32,900
We're on meds because we have stress.

5001
02:37:34,460 --> 02:37:35,220
Oh, I'm mixing...

5002
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:37,860
Oh, I'm mixing alcohol and meds.

5003
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:38,420
Oh.

5004
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:42,360
Wait, she doesn't know who prescribed us the medicine?

5005
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:46,120
Oh, it's like when people take, like, Adderall.

5006
02:37:47,260 --> 02:37:49,860
Like, you know how, like, they just be like, um...

5007
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:54,580
Uh, I don't know what excuse they make, but that's how, like, people get free Adderall.

5008
02:37:54,760 --> 02:37:55,900
Which is illegal, guys.

5009
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:57,620
Which is ill- I shouldn't tell you guys how.

5010
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:58,700
That's illegal.

5011
02:38:00,660 --> 02:38:01,020
Oh?

5012
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:05,760
Oh, Dwayne.

5013
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:06,640
I don't think you're helping.

5014
02:38:07,020 --> 02:38:07,320
Why?

5015
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:08,620
Yeah, you're making me sad.

5016
02:38:10,460 --> 02:38:10,840
Aw.

5017
02:38:11,320 --> 02:38:13,180
You're making me sad.

5018
02:38:14,740 --> 02:38:16,220
Oh, it's the plague doctor!

5019
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:20,980
It's probably blood money, but I don't care.

5020
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:22,280
Wait, I have money?

5021
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:23,360
Oh, we're rich?

5022
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:25,000
Yeah, I was gonna say!

5023
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:25,740
Oh, yeah!

5024
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:30,860
What, you married me for my money?

5025
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:32,160
Do you want me to kick the bucket?

5026
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:34,460
Do you want me to kick the bucket?

5027
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:40,740
I did not look like I had money.

5028
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:42,160
Like...

5029
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:43,940
I mean, have you seen this place, though?

5030
02:38:44,020 --> 02:38:45,120
This house is humongous.

5031
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:48,380
Yeah, but then it's the suburbs, where you can't...

5032
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:51,280
Like, he could've bought this house, like, 20 years ago.

5033
02:38:51,440 --> 02:38:53,060
Back when houses weren't that expensive.

5034
02:38:53,460 --> 02:38:56,040
Or he could've, like, inherited it from his, like, dead parents.

5035
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:56,480
Horrifying.

5036
02:38:57,320 --> 02:38:58,860
You should die.

5037
02:38:59,040 --> 02:38:59,920
I mean, it's just something.

5038
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:01,160
Claire, you're not helping very much.

5039
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:03,680
Yeah, you're not helping my depression, Claire.

5040
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:05,220
This is why I killed you.

5041
02:39:05,940 --> 02:39:08,260
Kill yourself by yourself alone.

5042
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:11,010
And die!

5043
02:39:11,530 --> 02:39:11,890
What?

5044
02:39:12,130 --> 02:39:13,310
I thought we're gonna...

5045
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:14,070
Whoa!

5046
02:39:16,230 --> 02:39:16,830
Yippee!

5047
02:39:17,330 --> 02:39:17,930
Yippee!

5048
02:39:17,930 --> 02:39:18,330
Yay!

5049
02:39:19,210 --> 02:39:20,910
Oh no, I remember the...

5050
02:39:20,910 --> 02:39:22,910
The spiral hallway.

5051
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:25,130
New ride!

5052
02:39:26,350 --> 02:39:28,190
New Six Flags ride!

5053
02:39:29,230 --> 02:39:30,390
That one was pretty long.

5054
02:39:31,130 --> 02:39:32,830
Yeah, that one was a long chapter.

5055
02:39:32,970 --> 02:39:33,790
Hey, that was four.

5056
02:39:34,190 --> 02:39:34,970
You're right, guys.

5057
02:39:35,530 --> 02:39:36,210
I got four.

5058
02:39:36,210 --> 02:39:36,750
Oh yeah, one left.

5059
02:39:38,190 --> 02:39:38,830
Pride.

5060
02:39:39,710 --> 02:39:40,670
Oh, please.

5061
02:39:41,310 --> 02:39:42,210
It didn't...

5062
02:39:42,210 --> 02:39:43,050
Your game...

5063
02:39:43,050 --> 02:39:44,190
It's alive, right?

5064
02:39:44,590 --> 02:39:44,730
Where am I?

5065
02:39:44,730 --> 02:39:45,330
I don't know.

5066
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:47,330
Oh.

5067
02:39:48,030 --> 02:39:48,910
Okay, it's alive.

5068
02:39:49,210 --> 02:39:50,350
Oh, I'm just in the...

5069
02:39:50,350 --> 02:39:50,650
Oh, okay.

5070
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:52,090
I was like, where am I?

5071
02:39:53,410 --> 02:39:53,890
Oh, okay.

5072
02:39:53,890 --> 02:39:55,050
Alright, one more.

5073
02:39:55,870 --> 02:39:56,830
Okay, nice!

5074
02:39:57,190 --> 02:39:58,810
Now, just the one by the front door.

5075
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:01,830
Okay, we gotta go back upstairs, though.

5076
02:40:02,270 --> 02:40:02,570
Yeah.

5077
02:40:02,830 --> 02:40:04,990
Why do we always end up in this area?

5078
02:40:05,110 --> 02:40:06,130
It's our little...

5079
02:40:06,130 --> 02:40:07,310
It's our chair room.

5080
02:40:08,010 --> 02:40:10,230
Oh my gosh, we're so close to finishing this, you guys.

5081
02:40:10,450 --> 02:40:14,530
Guys, I knew saving that one area for last was a good idea.

5082
02:40:16,570 --> 02:40:18,050
It is so convenient.

5083
02:40:18,310 --> 02:40:19,130
Right here.

5084
02:40:19,710 --> 02:40:20,390
There you go.

5085
02:40:20,570 --> 02:40:21,210
What is this?

5086
02:40:21,630 --> 02:40:22,590
Okay, but where do we...

5087
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:22,670
Wake up.

5088
02:40:22,750 --> 02:40:24,330
Where do we do with this one, though?

5089
02:40:25,070 --> 02:40:25,850
Where do we go?

5090
02:40:25,970 --> 02:40:26,310
In the garage.

5091
02:40:26,810 --> 02:40:27,550
Oh, it's in the garage?

5092
02:40:28,430 --> 02:40:28,910
Yes.

5093
02:40:29,330 --> 02:40:29,850
Oh, wait.

5094
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:31,050
It's our favorite place.

5095
02:40:31,450 --> 02:40:32,650
Wait, it stopped talking!

5096
02:40:33,170 --> 02:40:33,550
Hank!

5097
02:40:34,090 --> 02:40:34,350
Hank!

5098
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:34,610
Hank!

5099
02:40:35,190 --> 02:40:36,150
What's the point?

5100
02:40:38,550 --> 02:40:40,230
I think that controls the...

5101
02:40:40,230 --> 02:40:41,090
In the garage.

5102
02:40:41,890 --> 02:40:42,730
The lights in here.

5103
02:40:43,030 --> 02:40:43,650
Oh no, it doesn't...

5104
02:40:43,650 --> 02:40:44,610
Oh, actually...

5105
02:40:44,610 --> 02:40:45,470
I think...

5106
02:40:45,470 --> 02:40:46,590
Wait, where is the...

5107
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:47,130
Thing, though?

5108
02:40:50,450 --> 02:40:50,850
Um...

5109
02:40:51,390 --> 02:40:54,270
Move up the stairs to the top floor of the garage.

5110
02:40:56,690 --> 02:40:57,090
Okay.

5111
02:40:57,270 --> 02:40:57,510
There you go.

5112
02:41:02,380 --> 02:41:02,780
Now what?

5113
02:41:02,780 --> 02:41:04,800
There should be like a tool box or something in here.

5114
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,160
Oh, it's right here.

5115
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:07,000
It's a lighter.

5116
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:11,320
Hey guys, I found another lighter!

5117
02:41:11,900 --> 02:41:12,160
Yeah, exactly!

5118
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:13,260
A double wielding...

5119
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:14,760
A double wielding lighter?

5120
02:41:15,860 --> 02:41:16,340
Uh...

5121
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:16,740
Where is it?

5122
02:41:17,940 --> 02:41:18,420
Uh...

5123
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:19,040
Wait, hold on.

5124
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:20,280
Um...

5125
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:24,100
Before going through the door at the top of the stairs, move into the space beside the door.

5126
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:24,980
Past the...

5127
02:41:24,980 --> 02:41:25,800
Past...

5128
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:27,860
The stacked boxes and suitcases.

5129
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:29,940
Like this?

5130
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:30,160
Like this?

5131
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:31,060
I mean...

5132
02:41:31,060 --> 02:41:33,820
There's a tall red tool box against the wall.

5133
02:41:33,980 --> 02:41:34,380
That one.

5134
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:35,380
No?

5135
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:37,560
Grab the tool box and move it to the left.

5136
02:41:38,100 --> 02:41:38,520
Oh!

5137
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:38,820
What?

5138
02:41:41,020 --> 02:41:41,460
What?

5139
02:41:41,820 --> 02:41:43,560
It's so hard to move this slow.

5140
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:44,440
Oh, it's so slow!

5141
02:41:44,520 --> 02:41:46,700
Yeah, it's so incredibly slow.

5142
02:41:46,900 --> 02:41:48,920
I actually have to use my entire mouse pad for this.

5143
02:41:49,780 --> 02:41:50,220
Maybe...

5144
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:51,840
Maybe the video showed that.

5145
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:53,660
Because how the hell are you supposed to know otherwise?

5146
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:54,360
Oh, there it is.

5147
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:56,900
I guess that's...

5148
02:41:56,900 --> 02:41:57,520
Oh, alright.

5149
02:41:57,860 --> 02:41:58,340
Now where?

5150
02:41:58,500 --> 02:41:58,920
The...

5151
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:00,800
The Omega...

5152
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:02,120
Verse...

5153
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:02,280
Alpha...

5154
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:03,060
Alpha and Omega.

5155
02:42:04,440 --> 02:42:05,320
Alright, now where?

5156
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:08,320
The handle is in...

5157
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:09,940
For the hatch that was shown in the video.

5158
02:42:10,180 --> 02:42:10,540
Oh my gosh.

5159
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:12,240
It literally says that in the guide.

5160
02:42:12,340 --> 02:42:12,760
It doesn't...

5161
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:14,320
So we have to go watch the video.

5162
02:42:14,540 --> 02:42:15,800
Oh my god.

5163
02:42:17,620 --> 02:42:18,940
Where is the handle?

5164
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:21,440
Where is the...

5165
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:22,880
You have the handle.

5166
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:23,980
We have to go find the hatch.

5167
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:24,980
Yeah, where is the hatch?

5168
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:28,680
But where is the hatch?

5169
02:42:29,060 --> 02:42:32,000
The guide is like, I'm not gonna handle it all the time.

5170
02:42:32,300 --> 02:42:33,400
I don't care.

5171
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:36,660
It's...

5172
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:37,880
I don't know.

5173
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:40,960
Basement mannequin?

5174
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:42,540
Someone says basement mannequin.

5175
02:42:43,060 --> 02:42:43,800
Oh, okay.

5176
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:44,440
We can try it.

5177
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:45,340
The basement.

5178
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:46,980
It's always in the basement.

5179
02:42:46,980 --> 02:42:47,860
The basement.

5180
02:42:47,860 --> 02:42:49,340
When is it not in the basement?

5181
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:49,880
The basement.

5182
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:50,280
The basement.

5183
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:52,380
Everything is in the basement!

5184
02:42:57,020 --> 02:42:57,500
There?

5185
02:42:57,700 --> 02:42:58,680
By the mannequin over there.

5186
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:00,880
Check on the floor.

5187
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:02,520
Alright, I'm checking.

5188
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:03,480
Maybe we...

5189
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:05,740
Walked over it before and we never even realized.

5190
02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:06,900
Oh, that's true.

5191
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:09,220
Here?

5192
02:43:09,220 --> 02:43:10,060
By the mannequin.

5193
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:11,220
No?

5194
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:12,620
Nothing here.

5195
02:43:13,960 --> 02:43:14,920
Nothing here.

5196
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:17,540
Uh, is it in between like these sheets or anything?

5197
02:43:17,540 --> 02:43:18,480
Oh, there it is.

5198
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:19,420
Ah-ha!

5199
02:43:19,880 --> 02:43:20,440
Ah-ha!

5200
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:21,100
Whoops.

5201
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:22,220
Oh, oops.

5202
02:43:23,460 --> 02:43:24,300
Ah-ha!

5203
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:26,040
Ah-ha!

5204
02:43:26,040 --> 02:43:26,760
Ah-ha!

5205
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:27,960
Ah-ha!

5206
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:28,160
Ah-ha!

5207
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:29,340
I'm in the cutscene!

5208
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:30,640
What do you want me to do?

5209
02:43:31,140 --> 02:43:31,640
It's literally...

5210
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:32,400
Wow!

5211
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:35,340
Yeah, they're like, avoid standing in the dark.

5212
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:37,900
I'm like, in the cutscene, like...

5213
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:39,680
Okay.

5214
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:41,380
Oh, okay.

5215
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:42,740
Before you go in...

5216
02:43:42,740 --> 02:43:43,960
It says there's a...

5217
02:43:43,960 --> 02:43:46,820
You're on a timer as soon as you enter the room below.

5218
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:48,440
Okay.

5219
02:43:48,580 --> 02:43:49,040
It will start...

5220
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:50,520
Slowly start to fill with gas.

5221
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:55,580
You must quickly perform the required objective before gas fills the room or Dwayne will die.

5222
02:43:55,940 --> 02:43:56,620
Oh my god.

5223
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:57,940
Are you fucking kidding?

5224
02:43:58,300 --> 02:43:59,240
What do I have to...

5225
02:43:59,240 --> 02:44:01,420
You'll see an exit doorway ahead of you.

5226
02:44:01,580 --> 02:44:01,760
Yes.

5227
02:44:01,860 --> 02:44:03,860
Look to the right and get up on the counter.

5228
02:44:04,860 --> 02:44:05,300
Okay.

5229
02:44:05,460 --> 02:44:05,980
In that direction.

5230
02:44:06,140 --> 02:44:07,560
Grab a stool and break the window.

5231
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:11,640
Oh my god.

5232
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:12,400
Oh my god.

5233
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:12,620
Oh my god.

5234
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:12,900
Oh my god.

5235
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:13,520
Come on.

5236
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:14,240
Come on.

5237
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:14,720
Break the window.

5238
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:18,640
Oh my god.

5239
02:44:18,680 --> 02:44:19,400
I wonder if...

5240
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:20,740
I can't tell if that's the...

5241
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:21,400
The end of...

5242
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:22,460
If you'll die or not now.

5243
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:25,720
What do I do?

5244
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:28,880
Um...

5245
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:29,940
I don't know.

5246
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:30,300
Look around.

5247
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:33,820
Oh, there's the gas.

5248
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:34,980
Yeah.

5249
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:35,300
Oh!

5250
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:35,420
Oh.

5251
02:44:35,640 --> 02:44:36,180
You need that.

5252
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:38,040
Can you break this again?

5253
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:43,680
Okay.

5254
02:44:44,440 --> 02:44:45,240
Maybe you can...

5255
02:44:45,240 --> 02:44:46,280
Can you open it?

5256
02:44:47,140 --> 02:44:47,700
Oh.

5257
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,400
Exit the room by stepping back through the window.

5258
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:53,460
Okay.

5259
02:44:57,200 --> 02:44:58,140
Let me...

5260
02:44:58,140 --> 02:44:58,900
Let me...

5261
02:44:58,900 --> 02:44:59,660
Get up!

5262
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:00,960
Oh my god!

5263
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:01,800
I'm gonna...

5264
02:45:02,860 --> 02:45:03,420
Okay.

5265
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:05,100
To the exit.

5266
02:45:05,240 --> 02:45:05,700
To the exit.

5267
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:06,440
Okay.

5268
02:45:10,910 --> 02:45:11,470
Oh...

5269
02:45:12,290 --> 02:45:12,850
Okay.

5270
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:18,550
Um...

5271
02:45:18,550 --> 02:45:18,950
Um...

5272
02:45:24,230 --> 02:45:24,790
Um...

5273
02:45:24,790 --> 02:45:25,070
Yes?

5274
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:27,790
What's the next stat?

5275
02:45:27,930 --> 02:45:29,730
I could probably use the axe.

5276
02:45:29,890 --> 02:45:32,370
I'm literally looking at the axe right now, holding my axe.

5277
02:45:32,370 --> 02:45:35,490
Like, I don't know what... Hold on, I'm reading, I'm reading.

5278
02:45:39,830 --> 02:45:48,070
Walk through the wall with the damaged tiles across from the win- across from the counter with- with the window you broke.

5279
02:45:48,810 --> 02:45:49,250
Okay.

5280
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:51,350
Oh, I see it right there.

5281
02:45:51,530 --> 02:45:52,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5282
02:45:52,250 --> 02:45:52,510
Okay.

5283
02:45:53,790 --> 02:45:54,230
Seriously?

5284
02:45:54,650 --> 02:45:58,830
Okay, that was not the door I was apparently- How would I- How would I figured this out?

5285
02:45:58,830 --> 02:46:00,890
Why would they tell you to get an axe?

5286
02:46:00,890 --> 02:46:05,350
Why would they tell you to get an axe for the door and then have you not use it?

5287
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:08,770
You know what, you could probably use your axe for that, okay.

5288
02:46:09,250 --> 02:46:10,730
Oh, yeah, you- you need the lighter.

5289
02:46:10,890 --> 02:46:11,130
Yep, yep.

5290
02:46:11,830 --> 02:46:12,430
Oh my god.

5291
02:46:12,890 --> 02:46:13,570
There we go.

5292
02:46:14,510 --> 02:46:17,530
Why would I use the lighter when the room is gassed up?

5293
02:46:18,890 --> 02:46:20,110
Yeah, that too!

5294
02:46:20,450 --> 02:46:21,490
I'm just thinking.

5295
02:46:22,630 --> 02:46:27,610
Do I not have this- Oh, that's when you know it's all in my head, because there's no fucking explosions from that.

5296
02:46:28,230 --> 02:46:28,910
What the fuck?

5297
02:46:29,050 --> 02:46:29,530
Oh my god.

5298
02:46:29,530 --> 02:46:30,170
What the- Oh!

5299
02:46:30,370 --> 02:46:30,850
What was that?

5300
02:46:31,570 --> 02:46:32,310
I don't know.

5301
02:46:32,410 --> 02:46:32,910
I don't know.

5302
02:46:33,610 --> 02:46:34,170
What's happening?

5303
02:46:34,170 --> 02:46:35,370
My game is tripping out.

5304
02:46:37,390 --> 02:46:39,730
That was so incomprehensible!

5305
02:46:40,090 --> 02:46:42,710
Yeah, I just like, where did I go?

5306
02:46:43,150 --> 02:46:45,850
Why would they tell you you need an axe for the door?

5307
02:46:47,010 --> 02:46:48,370
And then you don't use the axe on the door?

5308
02:46:48,370 --> 02:46:51,050
And then they're like, you could probably use your axe for this.

5309
02:46:51,050 --> 02:46:51,410
What?

5310
02:46:52,110 --> 02:46:55,430
It's a- it's merely a justy suggestion, guys!

5311
02:46:56,290 --> 02:46:57,770
Am I going the right way?

5312
02:46:59,370 --> 02:47:00,610
Uh, probably.

5313
02:47:01,130 --> 02:47:02,010
Oh wait, there it is.

5314
02:47:02,050 --> 02:47:02,590
There's the tunnel.

5315
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:02,970
Okay.

5316
02:47:03,970 --> 02:47:04,530
Freedom!

5317
02:47:05,070 --> 02:47:05,230
Freedom!

5318
02:47:06,190 --> 02:47:10,850
Are we going back to the- Well, I thought we were going back to the playground for some reason.

5319
02:47:12,070 --> 02:47:13,450
Oh, they said probably.

5320
02:47:13,450 --> 02:47:14,210
You're right.

5321
02:47:14,210 --> 02:47:15,550
Probably, yes.

5322
02:47:15,770 --> 02:47:15,850
Oh.

5323
02:47:16,130 --> 02:47:17,870
No, they should not even have that.

5324
02:47:19,070 --> 02:47:20,070
As a thing.

5325
02:47:20,710 --> 02:47:22,070
That is so misleading.

5326
02:47:23,130 --> 02:47:25,350
Oh, there's tower footprints.

5327
02:47:25,790 --> 02:47:26,750
I don't like that.

5328
02:47:28,330 --> 02:47:28,990
Uh-oh.

5329
02:47:28,990 --> 02:47:29,710
Uh-oh.

5330
02:47:30,430 --> 02:47:34,170
Maybe it leads to the piece of the- The mask.

5331
02:47:40,930 --> 02:47:41,590
Where?

5332
02:47:42,450 --> 02:47:43,510
Keep following.

5333
02:47:43,510 --> 02:47:44,390
Follow the footprints.

5334
02:47:44,810 --> 02:47:45,750
Keep following.

5335
02:47:46,130 --> 02:47:48,910
Where does that footprints tell me to go?

5336
02:47:49,410 --> 02:47:50,230
Keep following.

5337
02:47:50,950 --> 02:47:51,290
Hello?

5338
02:47:51,810 --> 02:47:52,850
Keep following.

5339
02:47:53,590 --> 02:47:55,990
I guess- Are we going back to literally where we?

5340
02:47:56,570 --> 02:47:58,310
No, it goes this way.

5341
02:47:58,530 --> 02:47:58,730
Oh!

5342
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:01,730
It just stops?

5343
02:48:02,250 --> 02:48:02,590
Oh!

5344
02:48:02,770 --> 02:48:03,070
Oh!

5345
02:48:03,070 --> 02:48:03,390
Oh!

5346
02:48:03,510 --> 02:48:04,110
Oh, there it is.

5347
02:48:04,110 --> 02:48:05,690
Oh, you put it in the secret stash.

5348
02:48:05,810 --> 02:48:06,150
Yoink!

5349
02:48:09,070 --> 02:48:10,450
Okay, is that all of them?

5350
02:48:10,710 --> 02:48:11,910
I think we got all of them.

5351
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:14,350
Yeah, we found the pieces!

5352
02:48:14,630 --> 02:48:15,210
Now what do we do?

5353
02:48:15,210 --> 02:48:16,070
Oh my god.

5354
02:48:16,410 --> 02:48:17,910
Can we go back to the progress room with it?

5355
02:48:18,350 --> 02:48:18,710
Yep.

5356
02:48:21,250 --> 02:48:22,810
Yeah, just go back to the progress.

5357
02:48:23,590 --> 02:48:25,370
Uh, this way is faster.

5358
02:48:26,230 --> 02:48:27,630
Oh my god, I can see the light.

5359
02:48:28,590 --> 02:48:30,710
I can see the light, guys.

5360
02:48:31,910 --> 02:48:32,870
Follow the light.

5361
02:48:33,630 --> 02:48:34,610
Follow the light.

5362
02:48:34,890 --> 02:48:35,750
Follow the light.

5363
02:48:35,990 --> 02:48:36,930
We're almost there.

5364
02:48:37,290 --> 02:48:38,250
We're almost there.

5365
02:48:38,910 --> 02:48:40,070
Final boss time, yeah.

5366
02:48:40,830 --> 02:48:41,550
Oh my god.

5367
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:44,730
Just follow the light.

5368
02:48:45,390 --> 02:48:46,470
The tar man cometh.

5369
02:48:46,470 --> 02:48:48,450
No, no, no, no, no.

5370
02:48:48,450 --> 02:48:49,910
No, no, no, no.

5371
02:48:55,110 --> 02:48:55,750
Tartman!

5372
02:48:56,150 --> 02:48:57,430
Champion of the tar.

5373
02:49:01,550 --> 02:49:03,190
Alright, put on the mask.

5374
02:49:03,290 --> 02:49:05,370
They don't know who you are until you put on the mask.

5375
02:49:05,390 --> 02:49:06,510
Until you can't have the mask, yeah.

5376
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:08,510
Do you know Dream's a VTuber now?

5377
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:12,570
Yeah, he became a VTuber.

5378
02:49:12,970 --> 02:49:15,570
He did a VTuber debut and everything.

5379
02:49:17,030 --> 02:49:20,490
What was the point of his... everything that happened?

5380
02:49:20,630 --> 02:49:22,070
He can move his hands, too.

5381
02:49:22,390 --> 02:49:22,730
He can.

5382
02:49:22,830 --> 02:49:24,930
Yeah, what's the point of a face reveal?

5383
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:27,510
He just becomes a VTuber.

5384
02:49:27,770 --> 02:49:29,050
Oh my god.

5385
02:49:29,510 --> 02:49:31,370
Oh my god, put on the mask!

5386
02:49:31,730 --> 02:49:32,590
Put it on!

5387
02:49:38,610 --> 02:49:39,670
Here it is.

5388
02:49:40,010 --> 02:49:40,990
Now I'm Dream.

5389
02:49:41,730 --> 02:49:43,710
But with less of the controversies.

5390
02:49:44,430 --> 02:49:45,790
Okay, I hate to tell you something.

5391
02:49:46,110 --> 02:49:46,270
What?

5392
02:49:47,070 --> 02:49:48,350
We gotta go back to the basement.

5393
02:49:48,590 --> 02:49:50,070
I CAN'T FLOW FIGHT!

5394
02:49:50,230 --> 02:49:52,870
WHEN DO I LEAVE THE BASEMENT?!

5395
02:49:56,230 --> 02:49:57,230
Why is it?

5396
02:49:57,270 --> 02:49:58,570
Oh wait, look, everything's good now.

5397
02:49:58,830 --> 02:49:58,830
Okay.

5398
02:49:59,330 --> 02:50:00,470
Oh, then we're fine.

5399
02:50:01,170 --> 02:50:01,230
Yay!

5400
02:50:01,510 --> 02:50:01,850
Yay!

5401
02:50:01,970 --> 02:50:02,970
No consequences.

5402
02:50:03,890 --> 02:50:05,030
No, we're good then.

5403
02:50:05,370 --> 02:50:05,790
We're fine.

5404
02:50:06,510 --> 02:50:06,510
We're fine.

5405
02:50:06,510 --> 02:50:06,810
We're fine.

5406
02:50:06,850 --> 02:50:07,430
Back to the basement.

5407
02:50:07,590 --> 02:50:08,650
Back to the basement.

5408
02:50:08,650 --> 02:50:08,690
Back to the basement.

5409
02:50:08,690 --> 02:50:09,430
There we go.

5410
02:50:09,830 --> 02:50:11,430
It's like my second home.

5411
02:50:11,590 --> 02:50:12,690
It's daddy's basement.

5412
02:50:12,930 --> 02:50:14,170
Don't go in there, Lucy.

5413
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:17,630
Back to the basement.

5414
02:50:17,670 --> 02:50:17,810
Back to the basement.

5415
02:50:17,810 --> 02:50:19,350
Yes, put on our basement, Uncle.

5416
02:50:20,230 --> 02:50:22,470
All good things happen in our basement.

5417
02:50:23,430 --> 02:50:23,770
Yeah.

5418
02:50:24,170 --> 02:50:24,370
Okay.

5419
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:24,850
Okay.

5420
02:50:24,970 --> 02:50:26,630
Yeah, just follow the open doors.

5421
02:50:27,490 --> 02:50:27,930
And...

5422
02:50:27,930 --> 02:50:28,150
Here?

5423
02:50:29,030 --> 02:50:29,870
Hold on.

5424
02:50:32,030 --> 02:50:32,550
Uh...

5425
02:50:33,110 --> 02:50:33,610
Wait, what?

5426
02:50:33,790 --> 02:50:34,310
Here we go.

5427
02:50:34,770 --> 02:50:37,330
Okay, go down the stairs and swing a left.

5428
02:50:37,570 --> 02:50:40,030
Then move around the bottom of the stairs.

5429
02:50:40,390 --> 02:50:41,290
What does that mean?

5430
02:50:41,770 --> 02:50:42,150
Here.

5431
02:50:42,150 --> 02:50:43,050
Swing a left.

5432
02:50:43,290 --> 02:50:43,690
Can we go to this?

5433
02:50:44,430 --> 02:50:46,130
Just pass the next door.

5434
02:50:46,330 --> 02:50:47,950
Destroy the wall to the left.

5435
02:50:48,230 --> 02:50:48,730
Oh, it's this wall.

5436
02:50:48,890 --> 02:50:49,130
This wall.

5437
02:50:49,130 --> 02:50:50,330
Okay, we've already gone through.

5438
02:50:50,410 --> 02:50:50,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5439
02:50:50,770 --> 02:50:51,210
We did that.

5440
02:50:51,410 --> 02:50:51,910
We did that.

5441
02:50:51,990 --> 02:50:54,350
That's where, like, the Russian roulette, but with all the bullets.

5442
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:55,270
Yeah.

5443
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:56,170
Oh, yeah.

5444
02:50:56,510 --> 02:50:57,610
So there's no roulette.

5445
02:50:57,810 --> 02:50:58,750
It's just...

5446
02:50:58,750 --> 02:51:00,030
So there's no Russian.

5447
02:51:00,250 --> 02:51:00,990
It's just roulette.

5448
02:51:01,570 --> 02:51:01,950
Okay.

5449
02:51:02,170 --> 02:51:02,790
This is it.

5450
02:51:02,990 --> 02:51:03,770
Oh, my God!

5451
02:51:03,910 --> 02:51:04,430
The light!

5452
02:51:04,650 --> 02:51:04,950
Ah!

5453
02:51:05,430 --> 02:51:05,870
Flashbang!

5454
02:51:08,430 --> 02:51:09,050
This was...

5455
02:51:09,050 --> 02:51:10,470
Yeah, this is where the gun was.

5456
02:51:10,650 --> 02:51:10,850
Yeah.

5457
02:51:11,210 --> 02:51:11,330
That's right.

5458
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:12,470
What happened?

5459
02:51:12,690 --> 02:51:12,890
We should've...

5460
02:51:12,890 --> 02:51:13,850
You should've done that.

5461
02:51:14,130 --> 02:51:15,170
I should've done that.

5462
02:51:18,170 --> 02:51:18,890
Where are we?

5463
02:51:18,950 --> 02:51:19,590
Are we in heaven?

5464
02:51:20,690 --> 02:51:21,570
Oh, my God!

5465
02:51:21,710 --> 02:51:22,290
I'm in heaven!

5466
02:51:22,990 --> 02:51:23,790
See, guys?

5467
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:25,070
No.

5468
02:51:25,070 --> 02:51:25,670
Are you kidding me?

5469
02:51:25,670 --> 02:51:26,510
I committed.

5470
02:51:26,810 --> 02:51:27,930
I went to confession.

5471
02:51:28,430 --> 02:51:28,810
He doesn't earn this.

5472
02:51:28,810 --> 02:51:31,370
And then the Lord was like, you are forgiven.

5473
02:51:31,830 --> 02:51:32,950
And then I'm in heaven.

5474
02:51:32,970 --> 02:51:33,570
Oh, my God!

5475
02:51:33,710 --> 02:51:35,150
This game just lagged everything.

5476
02:51:35,530 --> 02:51:36,990
I'm lagging so hard!

5477
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:40,050
The credit scene has, like, so...

5478
02:51:40,050 --> 02:51:41,410
Oh, my God!

5479
02:51:43,750 --> 02:51:44,390
Oh,

5480
02:51:53,270 --> 02:51:53,870
my God!

5481
02:51:53,870 --> 02:51:57,710
Is that really the ending that we got after all of that?

5482
02:51:58,010 --> 02:51:58,170
That's it.

5483
02:51:58,190 --> 02:52:00,390
That was what everybody wanted to see?

5484
02:52:00,450 --> 02:52:01,310
That was the happy ending.

5485
02:52:01,310 --> 02:52:01,550
That was it?

5486
02:52:01,550 --> 02:52:02,290
That was the happy ending.

5487
02:52:03,790 --> 02:52:06,050
Okay, that ending sucked, not gonna lie.

5488
02:52:07,030 --> 02:52:07,530
I...

5489
02:52:07,530 --> 02:52:08,530
You are forgiven.

5490
02:52:08,530 --> 02:52:09,490
You are forgiven.

5491
02:52:11,070 --> 02:52:11,590
What?

5492
02:52:11,810 --> 02:52:12,290
What was the...

5493
02:52:12,290 --> 02:52:12,470
What?

5494
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:13,950
So, we faced everything?

5495
02:52:14,170 --> 02:52:16,550
We, like, acknowledged everything, I guess?

5496
02:52:16,790 --> 02:52:18,370
And then everything was fine?

5497
02:52:18,370 --> 02:52:24,630
I realized I was an alcoholic and also maybe too into, like, my prescription pills.

5498
02:52:24,750 --> 02:52:29,510
And then I went to confessional and then the priest was like, you are forgiven.

5499
02:52:29,510 --> 02:52:30,670
And then I went to heaven.

5500
02:52:30,830 --> 02:52:33,590
So, it didn't matter that I shot my entire family.

5501
02:52:35,550 --> 02:52:36,590
I guess...

5502
02:52:36,590 --> 02:52:38,770
And my family forgave me, too.

5503
02:52:41,090 --> 02:52:41,650
Like...

5504
02:52:41,650 --> 02:52:44,970
I don't know why my family forgave me, but okay.

5505
02:52:45,830 --> 02:52:46,930
Never punished.

5506
02:52:47,350 --> 02:52:48,490
Never punished.

5507
02:52:50,690 --> 02:52:52,090
Oh, my God.

5508
02:52:54,450 --> 02:52:55,190
Alright, cool.

5509
02:52:55,410 --> 02:52:56,750
Yeah, maybe there's something after this.

5510
02:52:56,890 --> 02:52:57,650
No, I think that's it.

5511
02:52:58,030 --> 02:52:59,450
Maybe there's a post-credits.

5512
02:52:59,990 --> 02:53:01,730
What would the post-credits be?

5513
02:53:03,450 --> 02:53:05,470
They send me back to Earth.

5514
02:53:05,670 --> 02:53:05,870
I don't know!

5515
02:53:05,870 --> 02:53:07,730
They're like, you were there.

5516
02:53:07,730 --> 02:53:08,030
What are you saying?

5517
02:53:08,230 --> 02:53:12,010
You have, like, unsolved, like, actions in there.

5518
02:53:12,150 --> 02:53:12,670
We're sending you...

5519
02:53:12,670 --> 02:53:14,050
You have not been forgiven.

5520
02:53:14,930 --> 02:53:16,330
We checked through our...

5521
02:53:16,330 --> 02:53:20,450
We checked through our books and we realized you forgot one thing.

5522
02:53:23,710 --> 02:53:25,310
Oh, yeah, we did it, man!

5523
02:53:25,610 --> 02:53:26,030
Yippee!

5524
02:53:26,810 --> 02:53:27,210
Woohoo!

5525
02:53:27,650 --> 02:53:27,750
Woohoo!

5526
02:53:28,850 --> 02:53:29,250
Woohoo!

5527
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:29,310
Woohoo!

5528
02:53:29,310 --> 02:53:29,930
We did it!

5529
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:33,090
I don't know how we would have done the last two chapters without the guy.

5530
02:53:33,350 --> 02:53:34,930
That was...

5531
02:53:34,930 --> 02:53:37,830
A lot of those were like, where do we go?

5532
02:53:38,910 --> 02:53:39,390
Like...

5533
02:53:39,390 --> 02:53:39,750
Like...

5534
02:53:39,750 --> 02:53:40,050
Yeah.

5535
02:53:40,970 --> 02:53:41,270
It was...

5536
02:53:41,270 --> 02:53:44,570
It's using your brain, but too much of what I've...

5537
02:53:44,570 --> 02:53:47,150
Too much to what I think we would be able to.

5538
02:53:47,450 --> 02:53:47,670
Yeah.

5539
02:53:47,830 --> 02:53:48,410
I have an excuse.

5540
02:53:48,510 --> 02:53:49,430
I'm sick right now.

5541
02:53:49,630 --> 02:53:50,050
That's...

5542
02:53:50,890 --> 02:53:51,630
Me too.

5543
02:53:52,890 --> 02:53:54,030
I'm sick in the head.

5544
02:53:54,350 --> 02:53:54,890
Yeah, yeah.

5545
02:53:54,910 --> 02:53:56,550
We didn't take any pills today.

5546
02:53:56,970 --> 02:53:57,910
The pills didn't work.

5547
02:53:59,790 --> 02:54:00,390
They never work.

5548
02:54:00,390 --> 02:54:00,530
They never work.

5549
02:54:00,530 --> 02:54:01,170
That box puzzle?

5550
02:54:01,450 --> 02:54:03,170
I don't remember what the box puzzle was.

5551
02:54:03,390 --> 02:54:03,770
I...

5552
02:54:03,770 --> 02:54:05,650
I don't even remember.

5553
02:54:05,990 --> 02:54:06,150
Box puzzle.

5554
02:54:06,150 --> 02:54:09,530
All the puzzles has blurred between my mind.

5555
02:54:11,170 --> 02:54:13,350
The grandma puzzle was fucking rough.

5556
02:54:13,490 --> 02:54:15,390
I would say the grandma chapter was bullshit.

5557
02:54:15,690 --> 02:54:15,990
That...

5558
02:54:15,990 --> 02:54:17,330
Yeah, that one was tough.

5559
02:54:17,490 --> 02:54:17,690
That one.

5560
02:54:17,690 --> 02:54:18,790
Thank you for playing.

5561
02:54:19,150 --> 02:54:19,590
Yay!

5562
02:54:20,690 --> 02:54:21,690
We did it!

5563
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:22,730
Yay!

5564
02:54:24,770 --> 02:54:25,370
Our...

5565
02:54:25,850 --> 02:54:27,330
Our journey's over.

5566
02:54:28,150 --> 02:54:29,190
That was it!

5567
02:54:29,550 --> 02:54:30,530
That was it!

5568
02:54:32,090 --> 02:54:35,210
I was gonna say the last chapter was definitely anti-climatic.

5569
02:54:35,630 --> 02:54:36,070
I...

5570
02:54:37,250 --> 02:54:40,090
Yeah, I feel like we should have ended on the...

5571
02:54:40,090 --> 02:54:41,590
On the picture frame one.

5572
02:54:41,590 --> 02:54:42,910
That one was like...

5573
02:54:43,790 --> 02:54:44,990
I kind of like...

5574
02:54:44,990 --> 02:54:46,170
It felt like a conclusion.

5575
02:54:46,330 --> 02:54:48,910
Yeah, that one felt more of a conclusion than the...

5576
02:54:49,570 --> 02:54:53,470
I just got forgiven and went to heaven to see my family.

5577
02:54:54,110 --> 02:54:54,270
I feel so...

5578
02:54:54,270 --> 02:54:54,390
Yeah.

5579
02:54:55,330 --> 02:54:57,210
I feel so unfulfilled.

5580
02:54:57,210 --> 02:54:57,690
Like...

5581
02:54:57,690 --> 02:54:58,630
I'd like...

5582
02:54:58,630 --> 02:54:58,650
Yeah.

5583
02:55:00,430 --> 02:55:02,730
That did not feel very fulfilling.

5584
02:55:05,110 --> 02:55:06,230
We should have went...

5585
02:55:06,230 --> 02:55:08,310
We should have went downstairs and just...

5586
02:55:08,310 --> 02:55:10,150
Did Russian Roulette with six bullets.

5587
02:55:13,150 --> 02:55:13,910
We can...

5588
02:55:13,910 --> 02:55:14,750
We always can.

5589
02:55:14,870 --> 02:55:15,650
You can load the game.

5590
02:55:15,650 --> 02:55:15,710
Yeah.

5591
02:55:16,130 --> 02:55:17,730
You can reload the game.

5592
02:55:18,150 --> 02:55:19,370
We finished the game.

5593
02:55:19,650 --> 02:55:21,030
We finished the game.

5594
02:55:22,230 --> 02:55:23,090
That was fun.

5595
02:55:23,090 --> 02:55:25,390
Just load a save and go down there before the mask.

5596
02:55:25,670 --> 02:55:25,810
All right.

5597
02:55:25,810 --> 02:55:25,850
Okay.

5598
02:55:26,410 --> 02:55:26,850
Let's go.

5599
02:55:27,050 --> 02:55:27,530
All right.

5600
02:55:27,730 --> 02:55:28,170
We'll do one...

5601
02:55:28,170 --> 02:55:28,790
Wait, can you do that?

5602
02:55:28,790 --> 02:55:28,910
What's it continue?

5603
02:55:29,110 --> 02:55:30,070
I'm pretty sure, right?

5604
02:55:30,330 --> 02:55:31,090
That's New Game Plus.

5605
02:55:34,050 --> 02:55:35,690
We're at New Game Plus now.

5606
02:55:36,530 --> 02:55:36,990
Let's see.

5607
02:55:37,210 --> 02:55:38,310
Let's see where it takes us.

5608
02:55:38,470 --> 02:55:39,270
That's the Russian Roulette ending.

5609
02:55:42,550 --> 02:55:43,070
All right.

5610
02:55:43,110 --> 02:55:43,890
Where does it take me?

5611
02:55:45,090 --> 02:55:45,850
Wait, do you have...

5612
02:55:45,850 --> 02:55:46,850
You don't have the mask on, do you?

5613
02:55:47,130 --> 02:55:47,710
I don't know.

5614
02:55:47,870 --> 02:55:48,370
No, I don't.

5615
02:55:48,790 --> 02:55:49,990
Where is the area?

5616
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:51,150
Oh, it's right...

5617
02:55:51,150 --> 02:55:51,750
Here?

5618
02:55:51,970 --> 02:55:52,350
Uh...

5619
02:55:52,350 --> 02:55:53,250
Yeah, you go through the wall.

5620
02:55:53,570 --> 02:55:53,970
Yeah, yeah.

5621
02:55:54,330 --> 02:55:56,890
Yeah, the mask ending would have given me like the...

5622
02:55:57,990 --> 02:55:58,790
Russian Roulette!

5623
02:55:59,330 --> 02:55:59,950
Russian Roulette!

5624
02:56:00,390 --> 02:56:00,450
Woo!

5625
02:56:02,770 --> 02:56:04,770
Six Flags opened another new ride!

5626
02:56:16,210 --> 02:56:18,310
Do you think I'm gonna hit it?

5627
02:56:20,010 --> 02:56:20,490
No.

5628
02:56:20,750 --> 02:56:21,810
No, I like my odds.

5629
02:56:21,810 --> 02:56:22,650
It's all blanks.

5630
02:56:22,770 --> 02:56:23,530
It's a blanks.

5631
02:56:23,530 --> 02:56:24,810
I like my odds.

5632
02:56:25,150 --> 02:56:25,750
Yeah, yeah.

5633
02:56:39,090 --> 02:56:40,950
Oh my god, just shoot it!

5634
02:56:41,470 --> 02:56:43,650
They announced they are closing a park?

5635
02:56:44,130 --> 02:56:44,790
Wait, what?

5636
02:56:45,170 --> 02:56:46,470
Oh, Persona!

5637
02:56:46,530 --> 02:56:47,590
Yeah, Persona!

5638
02:56:51,170 --> 02:56:52,630
Oh, hey, I'm back here.

5639
02:56:52,910 --> 02:56:53,590
Wait, where am I?

5640
02:56:54,830 --> 02:56:56,490
Well, you got an achievement for that.

5641
02:56:56,650 --> 02:56:57,130
Yeah, I did.

5642
02:57:00,890 --> 02:57:01,310
Nice.

5643
02:57:01,310 --> 02:57:03,190
I Persona'd all over the floor.

5644
02:57:05,950 --> 02:57:07,950
Is this, is this Persona?

5645
02:57:09,050 --> 02:57:11,310
Oh my god, you're like hobbling over.

5646
02:57:11,310 --> 02:57:11,610
Oh my god, I'm hobbling.

5647
02:57:11,850 --> 02:57:11,990
Yeah.

5648
02:57:13,670 --> 02:57:14,410
Where am I?

5649
02:57:14,590 --> 02:57:16,330
Oh, I'm in the progress room.

5650
02:57:16,550 --> 02:57:17,830
Oh, hey, look at that.

5651
02:57:17,970 --> 02:57:20,290
There, it's like, oh, it's like a speedrun strat!

5652
02:57:23,390 --> 02:57:25,510
I don't know if that is.

5653
02:57:25,510 --> 02:57:26,730
Look, I spin.

5654
02:57:26,950 --> 02:57:29,370
It's just, I don't have to climb up the stairs, guys.

5655
02:57:29,710 --> 02:57:30,830
I spin run.

5656
02:57:31,410 --> 02:57:31,750
Nice.

5657
02:57:33,530 --> 02:57:35,430
What was up with the tar monster?

5658
02:57:35,770 --> 02:57:40,290
I think the tar man was supposed to come out of the walls, but then we like...

5659
02:57:40,290 --> 02:57:40,930
He never did.

5660
02:57:41,130 --> 02:57:43,130
He never, we didn't get crazy enough.

5661
02:57:43,430 --> 02:57:44,270
I think so, yeah.

5662
02:57:44,550 --> 02:57:46,190
To like let him come out.

5663
02:57:47,790 --> 02:57:49,450
Oh, that was fun, guys.

5664
02:57:49,970 --> 02:57:52,890
The four-week arc is over, everyone.

5665
02:57:53,110 --> 02:57:56,990
We, we went through so much together.

5666
02:57:57,390 --> 02:57:59,970
Me and Mint and Whisp and Dragoons.

5667
02:58:00,110 --> 02:58:00,690
Oh, look, see?

5668
02:58:00,890 --> 02:58:01,530
I knew it.

5669
02:58:01,570 --> 02:58:02,490
Look at the poll, Mint.

5670
02:58:02,750 --> 02:58:03,470
Look at the poll.

5671
02:58:03,650 --> 02:58:05,370
Look at how many percentage it is on.

5672
02:58:05,370 --> 02:58:06,730
I closed out of it.

5673
02:58:08,490 --> 02:58:10,590
And look how many people voted!

5674
02:58:11,990 --> 02:58:12,670
Like...

5675
02:58:18,100 --> 02:58:19,420
I knew it!

5676
02:58:19,860 --> 02:58:23,660
I knew it!

5677
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:28,700
But, that was, that was a journey, Mint.

5678
02:58:28,820 --> 02:58:32,420
What was your favorite part from the entire series?

5679
02:58:34,320 --> 02:58:35,900
Um... Russian Roulette.

5680
02:58:36,620 --> 02:58:37,720
Because it ended.

5681
02:58:37,960 --> 02:58:39,640
It ended in a game.

5682
02:58:43,360 --> 02:58:45,840
I also liked going down the twisty hallway.

5683
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:46,260
Oh, yeah.

5684
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:47,020
I liked that, too.

5685
02:58:47,120 --> 02:58:48,380
That one was my favorite part.

5686
02:58:49,040 --> 02:58:50,680
No, you know what my favorite part was?

5687
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:53,300
The never-ending car honk.

5688
02:58:56,720 --> 02:58:59,640
Apparently, I could have turned it off at any time.

5689
02:58:59,640 --> 02:59:00,540
Yeah, I know.

5690
02:59:00,680 --> 02:59:00,740
I forgot.

5691
02:59:01,060 --> 02:59:02,300
I know you could have.

5692
02:59:02,460 --> 02:59:03,920
Yeah, yeah, you could have.

5693
02:59:04,100 --> 02:59:07,280
But it gave us more, like, it was more atmospheric, you know?

5694
02:59:07,360 --> 02:59:08,540
It immersed us more.

5695
02:59:08,700 --> 02:59:11,160
Hey, I felt more safe with the car honking.

5696
02:59:11,620 --> 02:59:16,700
Like, I think that's why, because apparently the husband was supposed to chase us, also, when we found him.

5697
02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:18,240
But, like, he never did.

5698
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:20,360
And I think it's because he was scared of the car honks.

5699
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:23,120
No, he did chase us a couple times.

5700
02:59:23,260 --> 02:59:23,420
No!

5701
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:23,960
No, he didn't.

5702
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:24,980
He never chased us.

5703
02:59:24,980 --> 02:59:30,280
We saw him one time to activate him being, like, an enemy.

5704
02:59:30,440 --> 02:59:32,060
But, like, we never saw him.

5705
02:59:32,140 --> 02:59:33,040
We just saw the granny.

5706
02:59:33,860 --> 02:59:35,400
Yeah, he never chased us.

5707
02:59:36,480 --> 02:59:37,000
Oh.

5708
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:37,520
Yeah.

5709
02:59:38,120 --> 02:59:41,000
No, I swear there was one time he did chase us.

5710
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:46,160
No, that one time was when I was like, he's friendly, and then he shanked me.

5711
02:59:46,500 --> 02:59:47,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5712
02:59:51,100 --> 02:59:54,100
He's like, I'm not friendly.

5713
02:59:56,680 --> 02:59:58,040
Friend or foe.

5714
02:59:58,200 --> 02:59:58,980
Friend or foe.

5715
02:59:59,320 --> 03:00:00,280
Always foe.

5716
03:00:00,700 --> 03:00:01,320
It's crazy.

5717
03:00:01,320 --> 03:00:04,860
A man holding, like, a bunch of knives could be, like, an enemy.

5718
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:05,820
Who would have thought?

5719
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:06,960
No.

5720
03:00:07,320 --> 03:00:08,320
Could never think about that.

5721
03:00:08,380 --> 03:00:09,400
Yeah, I thought...

5722
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:11,780
He was friend-shaped, you know?

5723
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:13,680
He was...

5724
03:00:14,200 --> 03:00:16,440
The dad bod makes him friend-shaped.

5725
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:20,820
He was a dad.

5726
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:22,340
What could go wrong?

5727
03:00:22,820 --> 03:00:24,220
Yeah, we got hunted by the granny.

5728
03:00:24,220 --> 03:00:25,500
We got hunted by Lucy.

5729
03:00:25,660 --> 03:00:26,620
Yeah, and his...

5730
03:00:26,620 --> 03:00:27,060
And her...

5731
03:00:27,060 --> 03:00:27,760
And her demon.

5732
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:28,980
That...

5733
03:00:28,980 --> 03:00:29,720
That other...

5734
03:00:29,720 --> 03:00:30,940
Remember the demon guy?

5735
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:31,620
That was like...

5736
03:00:32,220 --> 03:00:33,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, that guy.

5737
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:33,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5738
03:00:33,800 --> 03:00:34,980
We got hunted by that guy.

5739
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:36,300
He was so inconsequential.

5740
03:00:37,340 --> 03:00:37,540
And then the tar man.

5741
03:00:37,540 --> 03:00:37,880
Tar man.

5742
03:00:37,880 --> 03:00:38,160
Tar man.

5743
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:39,360
Oh!

5744
03:00:41,020 --> 03:00:42,140
Tar man.

5745
03:00:42,140 --> 03:00:43,320
Tar man.

5746
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:43,760
Tar man.

5747
03:00:43,760 --> 03:00:44,060
Tar man.

5748
03:00:44,060 --> 03:00:44,120
Oh!

5749
03:00:44,380 --> 03:00:45,180
Yeah, that was fun.

5750
03:00:45,300 --> 03:00:46,180
I had a great time.

5751
03:00:46,720 --> 03:00:48,600
Finally finishing Visage.

5752
03:00:48,880 --> 03:00:52,940
A game that I could never finish for the last four to five years.

5753
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:54,800
But we finally did it.

5754
03:00:55,340 --> 03:00:55,900
Finally.

5755
03:00:55,900 --> 03:00:57,240
Finally did it.

5756
03:00:57,400 --> 03:00:57,440
We did it.

5757
03:00:57,480 --> 03:00:58,320
Off the check mark.

5758
03:00:58,560 --> 03:00:58,860
Yay!

5759
03:00:59,400 --> 03:00:59,720
Yay!

5760
03:01:00,040 --> 03:01:01,120
I also finished the game.

5761
03:01:01,400 --> 03:01:01,680
Yeah!

5762
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:03,860
So Min never has to play this game.

5763
03:01:03,980 --> 03:01:04,060
Yeah!

5764
03:01:04,060 --> 03:01:05,460
Since she technically played it.

5765
03:01:05,740 --> 03:01:07,100
After all these years.

5766
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:07,540
I did.

5767
03:01:07,880 --> 03:01:10,560
I always think the scariest games out there is...

5768
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:11,560
Was it Layers of Fear?

5769
03:01:11,960 --> 03:01:12,400
And...

5770
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:12,780
Actually, no.

5771
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:14,160
Layers of Fear is goofy, though.

5772
03:01:14,260 --> 03:01:14,500
Isn't it?

5773
03:01:14,700 --> 03:01:15,800
I was gonna say, Layers of Fear is goofy.

5774
03:01:15,800 --> 03:01:17,460
Layers of Fear is very goofy as hell.

5775
03:01:17,900 --> 03:01:22,260
I always said, Mortary Assistant and Visage and PT are known as the scariest games, right?

5776
03:01:22,780 --> 03:01:23,140
Yeah.

5777
03:01:23,600 --> 03:01:26,800
Oh, I think a lot of people say, like, this is the scariest game.

5778
03:01:27,020 --> 03:01:27,120
I think, yeah.

5779
03:01:27,460 --> 03:01:28,000
Visage would be really...

5780
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,960
I think it's just because it's like a longer PT, but...

5781
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:31,180
Yeah.

5782
03:01:31,520 --> 03:01:32,420
I think the scariest...

5783
03:01:32,420 --> 03:01:34,700
I think the scariest chapter was Lucy and the grandma.

5784
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:36,380
The other two were, like, just...

5785
03:01:36,380 --> 03:01:40,060
Well, I mean, the other two was, like, a guy in, like...

5786
03:01:40,060 --> 03:01:40,380
In...

5787
03:01:40,380 --> 03:01:41,080
What were they called?

5788
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:42,440
The crutches chasing us.

5789
03:01:42,500 --> 03:01:43,800
That's not really that scary.

5790
03:01:44,360 --> 03:01:44,780
Yeah.

5791
03:01:45,220 --> 03:01:46,160
To be fair.

5792
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:46,540
I was...

5793
03:01:46,540 --> 03:01:47,760
He was fast, though.

5794
03:01:47,760 --> 03:01:50,520
He was fast, but, like, it wasn't, like...

5795
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:54,460
That's scary because, like, he kept bugging out, too.

5796
03:01:54,860 --> 03:01:55,300
Yeah.

5797
03:01:55,460 --> 03:01:57,320
That's why we could, like, literally...

5798
03:01:57,320 --> 03:02:01,040
If he lost track of us, he would just walk into a wall.

5799
03:02:01,380 --> 03:02:03,320
He just walked into a wall.

5800
03:02:03,560 --> 03:02:05,700
But that wasn't that scary.

5801
03:02:05,940 --> 03:02:10,520
And then, I guess Tar Man was scary because, like, the way he just looked at us.

5802
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:11,420
Like, his eyes.

5803
03:02:11,720 --> 03:02:13,720
But, like, we didn't encounter him that much.

5804
03:02:13,860 --> 03:02:16,580
And then, grannies are always scary because it's, like...

5805
03:02:17,260 --> 03:02:19,600
Like, you know, you don't know what they'll do.

5806
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:20,460
Yeah.

5807
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:22,420
I think you don't know what's on their minds.

5808
03:02:22,600 --> 03:02:23,400
They could be naked.

5809
03:02:23,680 --> 03:02:24,560
They could be naked.

5810
03:02:24,760 --> 03:02:25,300
Most likely.

5811
03:02:25,540 --> 03:02:29,580
Probability-wise, an old granny would be naked because they have nothing to hide.

5812
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:31,720
Would be naked.

5813
03:02:31,720 --> 03:02:31,840
Yeah.

5814
03:02:33,120 --> 03:02:33,560
But...

5815
03:02:35,780 --> 03:02:37,060
They're very scary.

5816
03:02:37,880 --> 03:02:39,120
But, yeah, that was fun.

5817
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:41,240
I had a great time.

5818
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:48,180
I'm glad Mint was here to play with me and keep me company throughout this because I was never going to finish this game solo.

5819
03:02:48,180 --> 03:02:49,300
That's for sure.

5820
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:50,540
When was this game released?

5821
03:02:50,820 --> 03:02:51,800
A long time ago.

5822
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:52,800
It was after PT.

5823
03:02:53,060 --> 03:02:53,080
Yeah.

5824
03:02:53,100 --> 03:02:53,860
That's what I remembered.

5825
03:02:54,360 --> 03:02:56,040
Oh, it was in October of 2020.

5826
03:02:56,620 --> 03:02:57,740
Oh, it wasn't even that old.

5827
03:02:58,140 --> 03:02:59,200
Omar, did you hear that?

5828
03:02:59,340 --> 03:02:59,720
Oh, wait.

5829
03:03:00,160 --> 03:03:00,740
Uh, wait.

5830
03:03:00,880 --> 03:03:02,760
I guess the initial date was 2018.

5831
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:04,200
Oh, the early access.

5832
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:07,220
Yeah, because the initial game only had Lucy.

5833
03:03:07,420 --> 03:03:09,640
And then, they added more chapters over the time.

5834
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:10,280
Okay, okay.

5835
03:03:10,340 --> 03:03:11,040
Over the time.

5836
03:03:11,740 --> 03:03:13,380
Uh, I also heard like...

5837
03:03:13,380 --> 03:03:14,860
Did you hear the new Silent Hill game?

5838
03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:16,100
That looks so good.

5839
03:03:16,520 --> 03:03:16,780
Yeah!

5840
03:03:17,060 --> 03:03:18,340
Yeah, the one that's set in Japan.

5841
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:18,680
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

5842
03:03:18,980 --> 03:03:20,640
I'm not going to be playing it, but...

5843
03:03:21,220 --> 03:03:21,400
Really?

5844
03:03:22,180 --> 03:03:24,060
I'm not playing that game on release.

5845
03:03:24,060 --> 03:03:25,280
Did you like...

5846
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:26,160
Did you like 2?

5847
03:03:26,580 --> 03:03:27,100
I...

5848
03:03:27,100 --> 03:03:31,800
That game actually scared me so much that I had like...

5849
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:35,020
My heart actually like was beating really fast every time I streamed it.

5850
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:38,260
And I was actually getting like goosebumps too when I was playing it.

5851
03:03:38,420 --> 03:03:41,840
And I could only play it maximum like 2 hours.

5852
03:03:42,100 --> 03:03:43,520
Because I would get too scared.

5853
03:03:43,900 --> 03:03:47,740
Like, I actually legitimately was so scared that I could only play 2 hours max each time.

5854
03:03:49,140 --> 03:03:51,300
Like, I'm really bad with horror.

5855
03:03:51,300 --> 03:03:54,640
I saw someone say that they have zero trust in the game.

5856
03:03:54,800 --> 03:03:57,300
But seriously, it's written by like Ryukishi7.

5857
03:03:58,320 --> 03:03:59,480
That guy is...

5858
03:03:59,480 --> 03:04:01,140
His brain is like insane.

5859
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:03,500
I have only the highest hopes for it.

5860
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:03,700
I don't know why.

5861
03:04:03,700 --> 03:04:04,480
What did he do before?

5862
03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:07,260
He's written like Higurashi and Umineko.

5863
03:04:07,780 --> 03:04:08,160
Oh!

5864
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:08,860
Yeah.

5865
03:04:09,180 --> 03:04:10,300
Wait, is it Umineko?

5866
03:04:10,600 --> 03:04:11,260
What's Umineko?

5867
03:04:11,420 --> 03:04:12,620
I know the other one.

5868
03:04:13,380 --> 03:04:13,920
It's...

5869
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:15,280
It's another...

5870
03:04:15,280 --> 03:04:16,500
It's like a murder...

5871
03:04:16,500 --> 03:04:17,080
Oh God.

5872
03:04:17,280 --> 03:04:18,680
How do you describe Umineko?

5873
03:04:21,200 --> 03:04:21,680
Uh...

5874
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:22,520
Uh...

5875
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:22,740
Uh...

5876
03:04:22,740 --> 03:04:23,240
Uh...

5877
03:04:23,240 --> 03:04:23,560
Uh...

5878
03:04:23,560 --> 03:04:24,080
It's...

5879
03:04:24,080 --> 03:04:25,560
It's like a mind...

5880
03:04:25,560 --> 03:04:26,480
Fuckery...

5881
03:04:26,480 --> 03:04:26,740
Everything.

5882
03:04:27,260 --> 03:04:28,360
Yeah, I never heard of it.

5883
03:04:28,420 --> 03:04:29,160
I know the other one.

5884
03:04:29,280 --> 03:04:29,680
The...

5885
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:31,340
The Higurashi is the...

5886
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:32,440
The village, right?

5887
03:04:32,940 --> 03:04:33,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5888
03:04:33,660 --> 03:04:35,520
The village where like things keep happening.

5889
03:04:36,200 --> 03:04:37,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5890
03:04:37,060 --> 03:04:40,000
Yeah, and they did like 300,000 like re...

5891
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,060
Like re-releases of him.

5892
03:04:42,300 --> 03:04:43,200
Of that show.

5893
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:44,860
Because it's so good.

5894
03:04:44,860 --> 03:04:45,680
It's really good.

5895
03:04:45,860 --> 03:04:46,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5896
03:04:46,600 --> 03:04:47,920
I heard of that one.

5897
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:49,040
Uh...

5898
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:49,780
But yeah, why...

5899
03:04:49,780 --> 03:04:51,540
Wait, why do people think it's not gonna be good?

5900
03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:58,960
I think because, you know, Konami has been a little, you know, iffy with their games.

5901
03:04:59,300 --> 03:04:59,920
Yeah, but who...

5902
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:00,200
Which...

5903
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:00,740
What company?

5904
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:01,300
What dev...

5905
03:05:01,300 --> 03:05:02,260
Is it like...

5906
03:05:02,260 --> 03:05:04,720
The dev focused fully in Konami?

5907
03:05:05,360 --> 03:05:06,300
Or is it...

5908
03:05:06,300 --> 03:05:06,600
Uh...

5909
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:08,260
Oh, I don't know actually who's developing it.

5910
03:05:08,340 --> 03:05:10,940
Because like Silent Hill 2 was developed by the Lairs of Fear people.

5911
03:05:11,340 --> 03:05:12,620
Yeah, Bloober Team.

5912
03:05:12,620 --> 03:05:14,480
Yeah, but they did really good though.

5913
03:05:14,700 --> 03:05:15,080
The re...

5914
03:05:15,080 --> 03:05:15,620
The...

5915
03:05:15,620 --> 03:05:16,900
That's what I heard.

5916
03:05:16,900 --> 03:05:18,680
That's the only reason I hadn't played it.

5917
03:05:18,780 --> 03:05:18,980
Because like...

5918
03:05:18,980 --> 03:05:19,760
No, it's actually...

5919
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:20,640
It's really...

5920
03:05:20,640 --> 03:05:22,000
I did hear that.

5921
03:05:23,140 --> 03:05:23,580
But...

5922
03:05:23,580 --> 03:05:24,600
I did hear that.

5923
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:25,440
So...

5924
03:05:25,440 --> 03:05:25,760
Yeah.

5925
03:05:25,940 --> 03:05:27,540
Yeah, but the...

5926
03:05:27,540 --> 03:05:28,680
It was really, really good.

5927
03:05:28,760 --> 03:05:30,960
Like I was actually really, really fucking scared.

5928
03:05:31,860 --> 03:05:32,300
Um...

5929
03:05:32,300 --> 03:05:33,580
But also, I'm...

5930
03:05:33,580 --> 03:05:34,760
I get scared really easily.

5931
03:05:34,920 --> 03:05:36,640
So you might actually not get that scared.

5932
03:05:37,340 --> 03:05:37,740
Uh...

5933
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:38,920
But for me like...

5934
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:39,460
The...

5935
03:05:39,460 --> 03:05:41,520
I think the remake was really good.

5936
03:05:43,100 --> 03:05:43,500
Uh...

5937
03:05:43,940 --> 03:05:44,340
But...

5938
03:05:44,340 --> 03:05:45,220
Other than that...

5939
03:05:45,220 --> 03:05:46,800
Yeah, I'm looking forward to the new Silent Hill.

5940
03:05:47,020 --> 03:05:48,360
The trailer looks really nice.

5941
03:05:48,500 --> 03:05:48,540
I know.

5942
03:05:48,540 --> 03:05:50,140
But we haven't gotten a gameplay trailer though.

5943
03:05:50,160 --> 03:05:50,820
That's the problem.

5944
03:05:51,460 --> 03:05:52,180
I know.

5945
03:05:52,180 --> 03:05:52,340
I still...

5946
03:05:52,340 --> 03:05:52,640
I don't know.

5947
03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:53,580
I still think it'll be okay.

5948
03:05:53,980 --> 03:05:55,060
Yeah, what is it coming out?

5949
03:05:56,540 --> 03:05:57,020
I don't know.

5950
03:05:57,880 --> 03:05:58,280
Uh...

5951
03:05:58,280 --> 03:05:58,740
What is it?

5952
03:05:58,800 --> 03:05:59,520
Silent Hill F?

5953
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:01,320
Uh...

5954
03:06:01,320 --> 03:06:03,160
I don't think there's a release date yet.

5955
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:04,780
I remember it's...

5956
03:06:04,780 --> 03:06:05,660
It's on Steam.

5957
03:06:05,660 --> 03:06:06,620
Let me see.

5958
03:06:06,800 --> 03:06:07,660
I saw it like...

5959
03:06:08,820 --> 03:06:10,560
It was like soon-ish, yeah?

5960
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:11,340
No date yet?

5961
03:06:12,940 --> 03:06:13,820
May 26th.

5962
03:06:14,240 --> 03:06:15,700
So I was like...

5963
03:06:15,700 --> 03:06:16,840
This month!

5964
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:18,060
This month!

5965
03:06:19,020 --> 03:06:21,740
It looks like Fatal Frame, Silent Hill.

5966
03:06:21,940 --> 03:06:22,780
I'm just so excited.

5967
03:06:23,140 --> 03:06:24,520
Have you played Fatal Frame yet on stream?

5968
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:26,240
Not on stream.

5969
03:06:26,920 --> 03:06:28,220
Why haven't you played Fatal Frame?

5970
03:06:28,280 --> 03:06:30,560
I know that's a game you've always wanted to play on stream.

5971
03:06:30,700 --> 03:06:31,120
I know.

5972
03:06:31,500 --> 03:06:33,180
Those games scare the heck out of me though.

5973
03:06:33,480 --> 03:06:33,920
Oh...

5974
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:35,120
I mean, I could be there.

5975
03:06:35,660 --> 03:06:36,100
Actually...

5976
03:06:36,100 --> 03:06:37,240
They're long.

5977
03:06:37,420 --> 03:06:38,340
They're way longer than this.

5978
03:06:38,560 --> 03:06:38,960
Oh, wait.

5979
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:39,600
How long?

5980
03:06:40,240 --> 03:06:41,040
They're like...

5981
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:42,400
Because they're like JRPG.

5982
03:06:42,720 --> 03:06:43,740
Well, not RPG, you know.

5983
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:44,680
But like they're...

5984
03:06:44,680 --> 03:06:45,080
You know...

5985
03:06:45,080 --> 03:06:45,900
They're long.

5986
03:06:46,100 --> 03:06:47,780
Which is the shortest Fatal Frame?

5987
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:51,020
The best one would be to do two...

5988
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:51,460
I don't know.

5989
03:06:51,520 --> 03:06:52,340
I like five also.

5990
03:06:53,560 --> 03:06:55,080
Fatal Frame 2.

5991
03:06:55,140 --> 03:06:56,680
How long to be?

5992
03:06:56,840 --> 03:06:57,180
Let's see.

5993
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:57,220
Okay.

5994
03:06:59,600 --> 03:07:00,000
Oh.

5995
03:07:00,160 --> 03:07:00,380
Oh.

5996
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:00,660
Oh.

5997
03:07:00,660 --> 03:07:01,960
Well, this is the main story.

5998
03:07:02,260 --> 03:07:03,880
This is about like 10 to 14 hours.

5999
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:04,860
That's not too bad.

6000
03:07:05,240 --> 03:07:06,540
I mean, this was a four-parter.

6001
03:07:06,940 --> 03:07:08,400
And we did like three...

6002
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:09,000
Two to three hours.

6003
03:07:09,300 --> 03:07:10,320
How long to be Visage?

6004
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:10,800
How...

6005
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:11,760
What are people's averages?

6006
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:12,580
Okay, but...

6007
03:07:12,580 --> 03:07:13,180
Nine hours?

6008
03:07:13,580 --> 03:07:13,760
Okay.

6009
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:14,780
Yeah, it's like similar.

6010
03:07:15,220 --> 03:07:16,400
It's just a four-parter.

6011
03:07:16,860 --> 03:07:17,760
I'm down for it.

6012
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:21,620
If you ever want to do Fatal Frame on stream and you need someone to be there.

6013
03:07:22,040 --> 03:07:22,140
Okay.

6014
03:07:22,640 --> 03:07:23,140
I'll...

6015
03:07:23,530 --> 03:07:23,780
I'll...

6016
03:07:23,780 --> 03:07:24,640
I'll...

6017
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:26,060
Reach out then.

6018
03:07:26,420 --> 03:07:26,560
Someone was like...

6019
03:07:27,640 --> 03:07:28,140
No.

6020
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:29,900
No.

6021
03:07:30,420 --> 03:07:31,080
Wait, what?

6022
03:07:31,460 --> 03:07:31,740
What?

6023
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:32,580
Oh, yeah.

6024
03:07:32,640 --> 03:07:33,360
And I did stall...

6025
03:07:33,360 --> 03:07:33,540
Oh, wait.

6026
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:33,900
You're right.

6027
03:07:33,900 --> 03:07:34,700
I did stall a lot.

6028
03:07:34,820 --> 03:07:35,820
That's why it's four-parter.

6029
03:07:35,820 --> 03:07:38,600
But I completed every chapter per stream, guys.

6030
03:07:39,020 --> 03:07:39,520
I...

6031
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:42,320
I still completed a chapter each time.

6032
03:07:42,520 --> 03:07:43,980
Even with the stalling.

6033
03:07:46,080 --> 03:07:46,480
Um...

6034
03:07:46,880 --> 03:07:47,280
Uh...

6035
03:07:47,800 --> 03:07:48,200
But...

6036
03:07:48,200 --> 03:07:48,600
Yeah.

6037
03:07:48,940 --> 03:07:51,160
Wait, which Fatal Frame are you planning on doing?

6038
03:07:52,060 --> 03:07:53,640
That's the one of the cameras, right?

6039
03:07:53,800 --> 03:07:54,480
That's why it's...

6040
03:07:54,480 --> 03:07:54,880
Three, two.

6041
03:07:55,420 --> 03:07:55,600
Two?

6042
03:07:55,660 --> 03:07:56,660
Yeah, the ones with the cameras.

6043
03:07:56,960 --> 03:07:57,160
Oh.

6044
03:07:57,520 --> 03:07:57,860
Oh, yeah.

6045
03:07:57,880 --> 03:07:58,580
Those are freaky.

6046
03:07:59,100 --> 03:08:00,440
I remember they're being freaky.

6047
03:08:01,420 --> 03:08:02,320
Yeah, they're freaky.

6048
03:08:02,660 --> 03:08:02,940
Yeah.

6049
03:08:03,240 --> 03:08:03,940
They're spooky scary.

6050
03:08:04,380 --> 03:08:05,240
Spooky scary.

6051
03:08:05,680 --> 03:08:05,920
Oh.

6052
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:06,760
All right, yeah.

6053
03:08:06,860 --> 03:08:07,060
Well, yeah.

6054
03:08:07,160 --> 03:08:07,700
Thank you, guys.

6055
03:08:07,920 --> 03:08:09,280
Thank you, everybody, for...

6056
03:08:09,280 --> 03:08:09,580
Yeah!

6057
03:08:09,580 --> 03:08:10,760
For hanging out with us.

6058
03:08:10,940 --> 03:08:12,920
We completed another game.

6059
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:14,160
Both Min and I.

6060
03:08:14,260 --> 03:08:16,640
Min never has to touch Visage on her channel.

6061
03:08:17,100 --> 03:08:17,460
Woohoo!

6062
03:08:17,940 --> 03:08:18,140
Yay!

6063
03:08:18,160 --> 03:08:18,760
I'm free!

6064
03:08:19,060 --> 03:08:20,460
She's free from Visage!

6065
03:08:22,040 --> 03:08:22,420
Yeah.

6066
03:08:23,140 --> 03:08:25,880
But thank you, Min, for hanging out with me.

6067
03:08:26,020 --> 03:08:28,040
For doing this charity goal with me.

6068
03:08:28,360 --> 03:08:29,860
I really appreciate it.

6069
03:08:30,280 --> 03:08:30,440
Yep.

6070
03:08:30,640 --> 03:08:33,180
And for being my great guide.

6071
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:35,900
That was very helpful throughout it.

6072
03:08:36,160 --> 03:08:37,520
She was so helpful, guys.

6073
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:38,060
I never...

6074
03:08:38,060 --> 03:08:39,080
I never...

6075
03:08:39,080 --> 03:08:41,000
One guide or misled ever once.

6076
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:41,540
Yeah, yeah.

6077
03:08:41,540 --> 03:08:43,540
There's a one guy on my shoulder.

6078
03:08:43,900 --> 03:08:44,400
No.

6079
03:08:44,840 --> 03:08:46,580
You guys need to learn from me.

6080
03:08:46,960 --> 03:08:47,480
But...

6081
03:08:47,480 --> 03:08:48,860
You need to re-watch this thing.

6082
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:52,900
You need to learn how to be a good backseater like Min.

6083
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:59,860
It's not like we were stuck in the fucking electrical room for 15 minutes because we forgot.

6084
03:09:00,380 --> 03:09:01,300
That was not my fault.

6085
03:09:01,320 --> 03:09:01,340
That was not my fault.

6086
03:09:01,420 --> 03:09:01,900
No, no, no.

6087
03:09:01,980 --> 03:09:06,640
It was both our faults because you also were there when I picked out that painting.

6088
03:09:06,640 --> 03:09:07,020
I didn't hear this.

6089
03:09:07,040 --> 03:09:07,940
I didn't hear this.

6090
03:09:07,940 --> 03:09:08,220
I didn't hear this.

6091
03:09:08,220 --> 03:09:08,540
I didn't hear this.

6092
03:09:08,540 --> 03:09:12,180
When we were arguing, you were there as well when we picked up that painting.

6093
03:09:12,420 --> 03:09:15,900
When we first found the electrical room and I was like, what's this painting?

6094
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:17,180
This is victim-blaming.

6095
03:09:17,220 --> 03:09:18,180
This is victim-blaming.

6096
03:09:18,180 --> 03:09:18,380
This is victim-blaming.

6097
03:09:18,400 --> 03:09:19,640
No, you're victim-blaming.

6098
03:09:19,820 --> 03:09:19,920
Me.

6099
03:09:20,200 --> 03:09:23,520
Someone should click the moment when we first found that painting.

6100
03:09:23,520 --> 03:09:28,040
and then just to propose that and then cut to the part where were trying to...

6101
03:09:28,040 --> 03:09:31,860
But we were in the breaker room arguing about where that painting is.

6102
03:09:32,020 --> 03:09:33,500
I wanted to see like, when.

6103
03:09:33,500 --> 03:09:37,680
I was probably reading the guide while you picked it up, but I didn't even see.

6104
03:09:38,060 --> 03:09:42,860
I want to see like- like where we were at when we first found that painting.

6105
03:09:43,680 --> 03:09:46,280
And it cut to like when we started arguing.

6106
03:09:50,060 --> 03:09:53,780
I think I was reading the guide while you picked it up.

6107
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:54,940
I'm just saying.

6108
03:09:55,340 --> 03:09:58,560
I think it was before we were reading guides.

6109
03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:01,940
What do you mean?

6110
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:05,120
I think it was before the guide itself.

6111
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:06,140
I'm a guide.

6112
03:10:06,460 --> 03:10:11,260
We were like, why is Lucy taking away all these lights?

6113
03:10:11,380 --> 03:10:13,200
What's the point of flicking them on?

6114
03:10:15,200 --> 03:10:16,260
Actually, I don't remember.

6115
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:18,140
I think that was on... No, we were on the Grammy chapter.

6116
03:10:18,340 --> 03:10:22,740
No, we were at the... We couldn't have been at the Grammy chapter.

6117
03:10:23,200 --> 03:10:23,940
I don't know.

6118
03:10:23,940 --> 03:10:26,620
You only get these once you start watching the day.

6119
03:10:27,060 --> 03:10:31,200
I don't know which chapter we were in when we got to the birth breaker.

6120
03:10:31,580 --> 03:10:32,660
I don't know.

6121
03:10:34,360 --> 03:10:35,300
We'll find out.

6122
03:10:35,340 --> 03:10:36,880
We'll find out when they make the clip.

6123
03:10:37,060 --> 03:10:39,060
Then we'll know what chapter we were in.

6124
03:10:39,280 --> 03:10:40,580
Which stream it was.

6125
03:10:41,540 --> 03:10:43,360
Thank you, everybody, guys.

6126
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:47,420
Is there any final words you want to make, Mint, before we end the stream?

6127
03:10:48,980 --> 03:10:49,780
Nah, I'm good.

6128
03:10:50,220 --> 03:10:50,620
Oh, okay.

6129
03:10:53,220 --> 03:10:54,300
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

6130
03:10:54,400 --> 03:10:58,560
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture, check in, move around to get that blood flowing.

6131
03:10:58,700 --> 03:11:00,720
And if you stay up for us, head to bed.

6132
03:11:00,920 --> 03:11:01,900
Yes, you deserve it.

6133
03:11:02,020 --> 03:11:03,540
Oh, yeah, Mint, you had a long day today.

6134
03:11:03,680 --> 03:11:06,100
You did a four-hour stream, and then you did another three-hour here.

6135
03:11:06,260 --> 03:11:06,780
I know.

6136
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:07,980
You must be tired.

6137
03:11:08,200 --> 03:11:08,980
Yeah, all right, guys.

6138
03:11:09,480 --> 03:11:10,260
Bye-bye, everybody.

6139
03:11:10,260 --> 03:11:11,680
Bye-bye.
