00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,520
Hello everybody.

2
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,880
Give me a sec.

3
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,100
I'm waiting for the caffeine to kick in.

4
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:06,820
I know I told you guys and I told myself I will not take a nap before my stream.

5
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,880
I will not take a nap before my stream.

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,940
But my body is so weak.

7
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,260
And the flesh... it needed the nap.

8
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,460
I think the worst part was that I took a nap at 12pm.

9
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,500
And then I was out for 4 hours.

10
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,560
I was out for 4 hours.

11
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,000
And if it wasn't for the alarm, I would have kept on sleeping.

12
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,080
OH MY GOOD!

13
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,540
This fucking skin suit!

14
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,900
Also... also guys.

15
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,540
Okay guys.

16
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,160
I know... This seems very weird that I am playing this game.

17
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,620
But I can explain.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,020
This is PG Family friendly...

19
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,220
This is PG YouTube.

20
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,340
Please!

21
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,720
Also, I need to make sure I don't swear for the first 10 minutes.

22
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,600
Because like, I told you guys, I got fucking hit on the Vade stream.

23
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,720
I got hit again.

24
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,500
And I have to send an appeal.

25
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,660
And it's okay now.

26
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,980
It's monetized again.

27
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:38,260
But like, I can't keep having my VODs get hit for profanity.

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,020
I can't!

29
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,140
When did I swear?

30
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,580
It's over.

31
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,480
I already swore.

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,520
I don't even remember, guys.

33
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,240
I don't even remember swearing.

34
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,860
My brain is not on at the moment.

35
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,940
Anyway, chat, look.

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,500
I can explain why I picked this game to stream this week.

37
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,160
I can explain, guys.

38
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,260
Look.

39
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,200
I am...

40
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,520
I am playing Cogwheel in the master plan of content creation.

41
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:24,900
And it is not my fault that Bunny Garden is now a Flavor of the Month game.

42
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,860
It is not my fault!

43
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,180
I am merely just following the masses!

44
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,380
I am but a sheep for the algorithm.

45
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,440
I swear!

46
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,780
Bunny Garden is the Bunny Garden meta right now.

47
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,560
I swear to God!

48
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,080
And YouTube, please do not demonetize me, YouTube!

49
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,060
I just want to go to this family-friendly restaurant.

50
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,660
This friendly establishment.

51
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,880
And see some ladies.

52
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,360
Some women.

53
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,460
Who are very family-friendly.

54
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,640
It is PG for pretty gals.

55
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,660
Ha ha ha!

56
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,220
Ha ha ha!

57
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,740
Ha ha ha!

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:17,420
Ha ha ha!

59
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,840
I...

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,540
PG for pretty gals.

61
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,880
That's what it means.

62
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,960
Guys, how is this game the meta?

63
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,340
I...

64
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,940
Don't...

65
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,380
Don't ask me how this game is meta!

66
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,520
As the fucking countless streamers are playing this game!

67
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,060
Don't ask me!

68
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,760
Ha ha ha!

69
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,160
Say hi!

70
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,460
Thank you for the super chat!

71
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,920
Thank you!

72
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,500
Thank you!

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,940
It may be friendly... family-friendly.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,620
But friendly fire is always on.

75
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,200
It's over.

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,260
Uh, YouTube, thank you for the super chat!

77
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,640
Thank you!

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,080
Thank you!

79
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,480
Enough!

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,160
Cope!

81
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,040
Show... Okay!

82
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,500
Ha ha ha!

83
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,080
Sir!

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,520
Sir!

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,240
This is a nice establishment, guys.

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,020
Ha ha ha!

87
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,500
I am sorry!

88
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,200
Ha ha ha!

89
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,100
Ha ha ha!

90
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,880
Guys!

91
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,640
This is a nice restaurant.

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,860
It's a small business chat.

93
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,900
That we...

94
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,060
We're supporting our local small businesses, everybody.

95
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,600
So get your money ready because these girls are gonna scam us.

96
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,080
Ha ha ha!

97
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,120
Ha ha ha!

98
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,660
Ha ha ha!

99
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,900
What?

100
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,900
Was that me?

101
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,560
Am I high though?

102
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,280
What?

103
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,780
What am I doing?

104
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,500
Why did I make such a big mistake?

105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,620
I would...

106
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,240
Exactly!

107
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,080
I don't...

108
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,760
I would never do something like this normally.

109
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,320
Exactly!

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Ha ha!

111
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,460
My comp...

112
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,940
Ha ha!

113
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,340
Oh my god!

114
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,060
This is too real!

115
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,520
Okay!

116
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,460
My company fired me!

117
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,380
It is what it is.

118
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,700
It's not the first time it's happened.

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,300
I'm thankful they hired me in the first place.

120
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:57,920
Oh god!

121
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,920
Why am I...

122
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,640
Ha ha ha!

123
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,700
This is too real!

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm thankful they hired me in the first place.

125
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,480
Ha ha ha!

126
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,420
I have nothing but gratitude for the company.

127
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,680
My boss even cried for me when they fired me.

128
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,640
He said, I'm sorry I couldn't help you out.

129
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,780
They told me that this company wasn't the right fit for me.

130
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,180
And that there are other places where I could shine.

131
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,040
It was nice of them to say that.

132
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,280
Okay.

133
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,100
Is there really somewhere out there?

134
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,900
Some place that would take in a fool like me?

135
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,400
Maybe all I needed to do was find my host club all along.

136
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,480
Even if I could get another job somewhere else.

137
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,620
I would just mess everything up for the people there.

138
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,740
Maybe my life is done for.

139
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,340
I didn't even think it had started.

140
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,280
Oh my god!

141
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,540
This is all I needed to do.

142
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Find a nice local small business.

143
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,540
Time to drink my problems away.

144
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm pretty sure there's a bar somewhere in this building.

145
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,240
Stare.

146
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm sorry?

147
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,340
I'm sorry?

148
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,740
But there seems to be something thatpes out of my head.

149
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,260
Okay, should I read what she's telling you guys?

150
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,820
Or are you going to pretend that you know Japanese?

151
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,640
Unless you do know Japanese.

152
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,560
Hahaha.

153
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,160
Okay, I'll read it out loud for you guys.

154
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,340
Just throwing out a guess here.

155
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,400
But does something bad happen to you?

156
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,060
Sorry, pretend that you can listen to Japanese.

157
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,480
Then I'll give you a drink and forget everything.

158
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,180
That's why you're trying to drink and forget everything?

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,480
Or...

160
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,280
Are you trying to get me to go to your hostess club?

161
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,980
Okay, I'm bringing the volume up.

162
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,580
Okay.

163
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,260
Let me bring the volume up, guys.

164
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,240
The sound guy wants to hear this anime girl talk to him.

165
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,400
You're wrong!

166
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,940
What just happened to catch my eyes before I get to work?

167
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,040
Don't call us out like that!

168
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,400
You look so tired as if your life is over.

169
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,140
Oh my god.

170
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
Guys!

171
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,640
Thank god there's no eye trackers.

172
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,700
Guys, I hope your eyes are up here!

173
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,980
Or here, because you need to read what she's saying.

174
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,920
I hope it's up here or here, guys.

175
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,580
Not anywhere else.

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,180
You look so tired as if your life is over.

177
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,000
You might be right, Ms. Anime Girl.

178
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,620
I knew it!

179
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:37,900
I knew it!

180
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,080
Yatta!

181
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,360
Oh sorry, this isn't something to be happy about!

182
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,860
Oh, am I going to get taken advantage?

183
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,620
My financial...

184
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,160
My financial worry's going to get worse.

185
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,820
I should have hit it right on the bull's eye.

186
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,580
It's so sad to think your life is over.

187
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,560
Yeah, I know.

188
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,860
Someone's like, please take advantage of me.

189
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,080
Fuck you.

190
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,620
What should I do?

191
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,460
If I invite him, then I'll really become a tot.

192
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,320
If I can't leave someone so hurt out in the cold, oh woe is me.

193
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,020
W Mercy, thank you for the super chat.

194
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,880
Thank you, thank you.

195
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,120
My eyes are obviously in the middle so I can do...

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,680
What do you mean?

197
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,660
Oh, don't worry, I brought the volume up again.

198
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,420
Just for you, sound guy.

199
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,520
Got it.

200
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,660
You don't have to come in the shop.

201
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,820
You can just have a sneak peek.

202
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,280
Oh, that's how they get you.

203
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,260
That's how they get you.

204
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,620
The sneak peek.

205
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,260
I don't know what's going on.

206
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
Oh shit, really?

207
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,120
You do?

208
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,060
You work here?

209
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,260
Oh!

210
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,020
I didn't know they opened this kind of bar there.

211
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,660
It's some place where I can drink with girls?

212
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,520
I've never been in a shop like this before.

213
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,140
It's clean.

214
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,500
Oh my god, my life is a mess.

215
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,580
It's clean and the girls are cute.

216
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,200
I guess... I guess I'll give it a try.

217
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,280
Oh, you're going to get me in trouble, sir.

218
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,260
No, are you taking that money out?

219
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,780
No, sir, don't take the money out.

220
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,700
Oh my god, we only accept a hundred dollar bill, sir.

221
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,120
And clearly you don't seem like you're wise.

222
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,140
It's not wise.

223
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,220
Clearly it seems it's not wise to spend that type of money.

224
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,720
So I can't come in?

225
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,060
That's all today.

226
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,600
I'll just give you a glimpse.

227
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,020
You come inside and I'm really a...

228
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,840
Oh no!

229
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:00,920
No!

230
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,040
Why did you let me see this?

231
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,800
If I give you the right to come to the shop as a customer, whenever you're interested, I'll be waiting for you to come.

232
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,700
Mr. Two, thank you for the super chat.

233
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,540
Thank you, thank you.

234
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,220
Why waste your money on host clubs when you send it to VTubers?

235
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,240
They're clearly superior.

236
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,240
Thank you for the super chat.

237
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,940
Thank you.

238
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,040
Thank you.

239
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,500
Thank you!

240
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,620
Okay, you send it to VTubers who are going to host hostess clubs.

241
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,600
So you can get both the two experience at once.

242
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:41,600
You can live vicariously through the VTuber playing this game.

243
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,020
You get both the VTuber and the hostess club.

244
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,540
Let's see...

245
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,440
You're so sincere.

246
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,740
Your life isn't over.

247
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,660
You'll be okay.

248
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,140
I know you will.

249
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,820
Huh?

250
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,060
Right now, even if it was small, I know you smiled.

251
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,920
That means you're not done yet.

252
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,780
What?

253
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,740
Thank you.

254
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,420
I'll be here at the shop waiting for you.

255
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,940
I'm looking forward to the next time we can see each other.

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,180
Oh, you mean right now, right?

257
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Alright, I'll let you go.

258
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
What was her deal?

259
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,400
She was so strange.

260
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,460
She doesn't even know me.

261
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,280
But...

262
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,120
I guess I do feel a little better.

263
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,180
I'm such a simple guy.

264
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,760
I see girls...

265
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,180
My...

266
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,300
My...

267
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,040
My self-esteem, guys, is happy.

268
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,100
Self-esteem!

269
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,880
Just a simple little guy.

270
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,380
Now, I don't know if I really want to get drunk and forget about everything.

271
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm just gonna go home.

272
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,720
My self-esteem is up now.

273
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,480
My life isn't over, huh?

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,840
No way.

275
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,040
Why would I take something a girl said to me seriously when I don't even know her name?

276
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,020
She didn't seem to be joking around.

277
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,120
But...

278
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,520
You know...

279
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,520
I mean...

280
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,760
It's not like anyone has ever told me that my life is done.

281
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm the only one who thinks that.

282
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,960
If I don't finish it myself...

283
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,180
Maybe it's still possible to start again.

284
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh my god, is that gorillas?

285
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,320
But what if they're anime girls?

286
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,600
Princess too.

287
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm sorry for calling you...

288
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,660
Oh, hello?

289
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,960
I'm sorry for calling you without notice.

290
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,600
You know how you were saying work was busy?

291
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
And you need help?

292
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,320
Do you still need help?

293
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,860
If you like...

294
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,600
Would you...

295
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,560
Take me?

296
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,720
Am I going back already?

297
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,960
Oh my god, it's like Persona.

298
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,020
Wait, oh my god.

299
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,460
A lot of days passed.

300
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,580
It's been a week since I...

301
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,120
Oh, I got a new job!

302
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,300
I thought I called the hostess club again.

303
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,840
I was like, please take me.

304
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,840
It's been a week since I started my new job.

305
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,780
What should I use my money on?

306
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,860
That being said...

307
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,920
Me being positive is all thanks to her.

308
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,960
That'll net...

309
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,160
Let me spend all the money I've earned.

310
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,680
Just to reward her.

311
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,840
Should I go to that chick's shop?

312
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,380
This week's salary has been paid.

313
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,260
Payment is made every Saturday for your new job.

314
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,320
Spend it carefully.

315
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,780
Wait, what happens if I...

316
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,620
Okay, this week's salary has been paid.

317
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,060
45,000 yen.

318
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,560
Oh my god, what?

319
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,200
Wait...

320
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,720
There's more to this?

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,660
I'm gonna have to gamble?

322
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,100
Wait, what?

323
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,520
Oh my god!

324
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,300
Oh, this is so fucked up.

325
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Oh no.

326
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,980
This is how they're gonna get you.

327
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,280
The gambling.

328
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,700
This is how they're gonna get you.

329
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,640
We're gonna go pachinko soon.

330
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,880
Okay.

331
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,180
I think there was a shop here.

332
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm a bit nervous though.

333
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,350
Oh my god, that's her!

334
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,650
The customer who looked tired!

335
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,350
You came!

336
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,490
That's right.

337
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,510
The customer who looked tired.

338
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,610
I'm here.

339
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,030
And I have money now!

340
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,990
And I have money now!

341
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,970
My life is so much better.

342
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,950
And it is here.

343
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,090
But you know what?

344
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,770
I felt like I've had it too good for too long.

345
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,050
So I wanna feel like what it's like to be broken.

346
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,650
But also have female attention.

347
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,430
Hello, thank you for the super chat.

348
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,270
Thank you, thank you.

349
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,910
What kind of job does this guy have to afford a hostess bar, gambling, and vacations?

350
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,850
Thank you for the super chat.

351
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,030
Thank you, thank you.

352
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,330
Joshua, thank you for the super chat.

353
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,050
Thank you, thank you.

354
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,070
You must gamble away your entire paycheck.

355
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,170
Look.

356
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,190
I can't.

357
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,410
If I gamble away my entire paycheck, how would I spend my money on pretty women?

358
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,070
Is this your first time at a place like this?

359
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,630
Yes.

360
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,010
For the stream meta.

361
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,270
That's right.

362
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,430
I've never been here before.

363
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,410
I see.

364
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,550
Well then.

365
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,590
I'll give you a brief explanation about how it works.

366
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,430
Oh, that skirt is way too short.

367
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,130
Thank God my head is covering the other women.

368
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,670
Please.

369
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,110
I don't know anything.

370
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,410
So this will help.

371
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,290
The name of this shop is Bunny Garden.

372
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,930
A fun place to drink.

373
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,630
That's all.

374
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,450
Oh.

375
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,110
It seems like I should understand.

376
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,910
But I don't.

377
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,710
Shady.

378
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,450
Thank you for the aca-soupa.

379
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,090
Thank you, thank you.

380
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,730
Holy moly.

381
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,510
Wow.

382
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,730
It's red.

383
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,350
Just like the color of her bow tie.

384
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,090
Right guys?

385
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,730
Well, you gradually get used to it.

386
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,490
So it's okay.

387
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,550
I'll be really happy with King here a lot of, lots of times.

388
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,870
I agree.

389
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,670
To do that, I have to work hard at my current job.

390
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,350
Well then.

391
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,770
Oh no.

392
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,130
Why are you looking at me like that?

393
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,890
The moment she come, she put her hands up, my eyes went to the face.

394
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,090
Oh, I see.

395
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,450
I got you.

396
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,330
Well then, I want you to be able to do your best.

397
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,190
So I hope I can give you lots of healing.

398
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,870
That makes sense.

399
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,010
I feel I can work harder if I feel better.

400
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,790
It's decided.

401
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,670
I'm sorry.

402
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,010
I didn't hear your order.

403
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,150
Order.

404
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,410
Did I order something?

405
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,990
I'm sorry, my mind is somewhere else right now.

406
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,330
Here you are.

407
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,410
This is the menu.

408
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,430
Maybe I'll have a drink.

409
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,490
What drink did you want?

410
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,750
A customer must purchase a drink.

411
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,230
A pricier drink can increase your...

412
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,970
Guys, did you hear that?

413
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,290
She said if I buy the most expensive drink, I'll be so likeable.

414
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,910
Okay, maybe not that expensive.

415
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,950
Alright, I'll give them a little sneak peek of my money.

416
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,710
Alright, this sparkling wine has gorgeous aroma of grape.

417
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,230
It's popular worldwide.

418
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,810
Especially... Oh my god, the women like it!

419
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,670
Maybe they'll share the drink with me!

420
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,050
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

421
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,870
Thank you, thank you.

422
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,730
Seeing how much they have to carry...

423
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,010
I think those girls need the money to deal with bad problems.

424
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,710
Thank you for the super chat.

425
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,850
Thank you, thank you.

426
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,770
Alright, I wanna confirm my order.

427
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,350
Oh my god.

428
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,030
See, this is how you do it guys.

429
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,750
Guys and women.

430
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,950
This is how you do it.

431
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,230
You buy a drink that women like.

432
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,850
So they'll wanna drink it with you.

433
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,090
Not because they're trying to make me order too...

434
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,710
Not because...

435
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,290
That she wants me for my money.

436
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,590
It's because she's...

437
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,890
Really thirsty guys.

438
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,330
You don't understand.

439
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,430
She's just really thirsty.

440
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,090
And I ordered...

441
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,510
Oh shi...

442
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,170
Hahahaha

443
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,650
Anyway...

444
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,530
It's because she's really thirsty.

445
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,990
And she saw me order a drink that she likes.

446
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,810
Because this drink is something that women likes.

447
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,350
That's why.

448
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,350
Hahahaha Joshua, thank you for the super chat.

449
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,450
Thank you, thank you.

450
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,550
Hahahaha Women will come here.

451
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,510
You're a high roller, dokey.

452
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,890
Women are temperate.

453
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,570
The slot machines are eternal.

454
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,650
Hahahaha Thank you for the Aka soup.

455
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,090
But thank you, thank you.

456
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,310
You can treat the cast members to a drink.

457
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,730
Some drinks are more preferred than others.

458
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,550
And some are easier to get drunk on.

459
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,050
You don't treat...

460
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,950
Who the fuck is she?

461
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,350
Give me the other girl.

462
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,550
Hahahaha Hahahaha You never forget your first, guys.

463
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,530
Hahahaha Your first hostess.

464
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,370
If you don't treat them to drinks, they will prioritize...

465
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:10,950
No!

466
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,330
I'm the only customer you should worry about.

467
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,850
I'm the only customer you should talk to.

468
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,430
Treat your cast member to a drink.

469
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,990
Oh my god.

470
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,450
I have to buy another one?

471
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:24,850
Oh.

472
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,950
Oh my god.

473
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,070
I should buy a cheap one for myself.

474
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,510
Because...

475
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,230
Hahahaha Because I don't deserve it.

476
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,090
And she's the queen.

477
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,490
Alright, here.

478
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,510
Here's also the red one.

479
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:37,570
Oh, it's a plastic.

480
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,870
Of course.

481
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,070
Of course.

482
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,950
You deserve it, girl.

483
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:45,990
You fuck...

484
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,090
Oh my god.

485
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,770
Hahahaha Guys, are you looking at her head right now?

486
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,470
You can talk to the cast.

487
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,870
Something might happen.

488
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,330
You can gift...

489
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,350
You can give a gift to each cast member once a day.

490
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,430
Gifts can be purchased from home.

491
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,710
You can treat the cast members to food.

492
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,790
There may be a preference for different foods.

493
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,450
Okay.

494
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,250
Um...

495
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,470
Guys, women like it when you listen to them.

496
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,610
I'm getting kinda nervous.

497
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,210
Pro tip.

498
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,450
Pro tip right here.

499
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,270
I mean, it's gonna be the first time I meet this next customer.

500
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,870
My heart feels like it's going to explode from how fast it's...

501
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,830
Next customer?

502
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,010
What do you mean, next customer?

503
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:33,730
Kana?

504
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,130
I literally just got here and you're gonna leave me already?

505
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,610
Oh, what am I saying?

506
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,270
The purpose of this place is to make customers feel relaxed, not stressed.

507
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,250
If I'm in a state like this, I'm sure the customer's gonna feel the same.

508
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,410
Come on now.

509
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,450
You got this.

510
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,530
This is...

511
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,530
Guys, guys, guys.

512
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,850
To avoid this, you have to spend more money.

513
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,510
So she'll never get to the next customer, guys.

514
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,610
This is it.

515
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,210
Um...

516
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,710
Kaitsu.

517
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,010
Thank you for the super chat.

518
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,830
Thank you, thank you.

519
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,490
Aiyo, remove the tutorial explanation.

520
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,350
Okay, let's start off with the usual.

521
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,450
Where...

522
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,050
Right here.

523
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,750
This is where my cursor is right now.

524
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,510
To her face.

525
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,050
Her big personality lies in the face, guys.

526
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,970
Lies in the face.

527
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,670
The first step in order to become friends, you're the customer.

528
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,610
So please, go ahead with everything you've got.

529
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,570
The first step?

530
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,010
Like an introduction?

531
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,810
So a toast or something.

532
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,110
What about...

533
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,670
Oh no.

534
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,930
I need to be likeable now.

535
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,710
Proceed and enjoy the conversation by selecting your preferred answer.

536
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,010
There's some things that affect likeability.

537
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,470
Choose your words carefully.

538
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,830
It's okay, guys.

539
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,970
I'm a woman.

540
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,790
I know what we like to hear.

541
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,810
It would be so fucked if I get this wrong.

542
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,010
Guys, I'm on home turf now, guys.

543
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,030
I'm on home turf.

544
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,770
I know what we like, I think.

545
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,730
Okay.

546
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,510
The first step.

547
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,490
Okay.

548
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,010
Like an introduction.

549
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,170
Like an introduction?

550
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,510
You can do it, Doki!

551
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,110
Yes!

552
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,350
I knew it!

553
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,130
Okay, bro, bingo!

554
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,350
We met for the first time after all, so it's only natural to start with introductions.

555
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,070
Anyway, I'd love to know more about you.

556
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,350
I gotta lie.

557
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,590
Because women don't want to know the truth.

558
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,950
My name is Haido Kanda.

559
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,130
Hmm, Haido-kun.

560
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,450
Haido-kun.

561
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,280
Yeah, Haido-kun.

562
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,080
Got it.

563
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,620
Joshua, thank you for the super chat.

564
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,580
Thank you, thank you.

565
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,200
Trying to cuck you even before the next customer comes in speedrunning the gambling route.

566
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,980
Thank you for the super chat.

567
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,020
Thank you, thank you.

568
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,900
You don't need to keep looking at me like, guys, I can't help that my cursor keeps falling down there.

569
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,580
Okay, guys?

570
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,540
It's just natural.

571
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,700
It's FPS games.

572
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,620
Because in FPS games, you always have to aim.

573
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,180
in the center, okay, guys?

574
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,120
So my mouse is naturally in the center.

575
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,820
It's not my fault that she's in the center, guys.

576
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,600
Okay?

577
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,020
It's just... it's just reflexes.

578
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,500
Okay?

579
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:59,080
My mouse... you know, like, it has to fall in the center naturally when I play FPS games.

580
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,120
You don't need to keep looking at me like that.

581
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,980
Haha, sorry.

582
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,160
Haha, sorry.

583
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,920
I was just trying to remember your name and face.

584
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,640
I wanted to remember your name and face, you see, so I was doing my best to store that into my head.

585
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,700
But it's okay.

586
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,380
You can remember your face and name, right?

587
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,180
There's no need to worry.

588
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,180
I match your face to your name now.

589
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,160
So next is my turn.

590
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,820
It is!

591
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,200
I swear, Yoshi!

592
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Thank you for the super chat!

593
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Thank you, thank you!

594
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,940
Super Shuriken Doki Gamer Reflex.

595
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,380
It is!

596
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,460
I naturally have my mouse in the center!

597
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,900
Okay, it's my turn now.

598
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,360
My name is Kana.

599
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,160
I don't mind if you give me a nickname, but I sure hope you remember me.

600
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
Of course I'll remember you, Kana.

601
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
You never forget your first, guys.

602
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,680
You never forget.

603
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,540
Alright, I'll do my best to match your name to your face then.

604
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,600
Kana-chan.

605
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,320
Yeah.

606
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,720
Kana-chan.

607
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,420
Hmm.

608
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,760
Hey, stop it.

609
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,120
You're making me all flustered.

610
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,440
I...

611
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,600
I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at.

612
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,320
Oh, really?

613
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,420
Okay.

614
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,840
She's good.

615
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,700
She knows what's gonna get me to open my wallet.

616
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,480
She's so fucking good, guys.

617
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,240
If I do that, he'll be like, Stop it, dragoons!

618
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,560
You're making me all flustered.

619
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,600
Oh my gosh.

620
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,200
I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at, dragoons.

621
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,060
Stop!

622
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,380
I suppose...

623
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,400
I suppose there are some things you need to learn from first-hand experience.

624
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,440
Yeah, I guess I got a little smarter from this whole situation.

625
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,140
Dimitri, thank you for the super chat.

626
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,120
Thank you, thank you.

627
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,440
Lock in, Doki.

628
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,360
This cute fictional girl game is less intimidating if you take it way too seriously and just power through.

629
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,140
I am taking this so seriously.

630
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,820
Seriously, guys.

631
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,200
You don't understand.

632
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,600
I literally spent 20,000 yen already.

633
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,220
That is very serious.

634
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,020
Tell me more about yourself, Haito-kun.

635
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,320
I messed up real bad at work recently.

636
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,780
And because of that, the boss fired me.

637
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,680
So I've been assisting a friend at his work ever since.

638
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,200
Oh, that sounds rough.

639
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,260
I'm okay.

640
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,740
Thank you for the super chat.

641
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,800
Thank you, thank you.

642
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,400
And Zip's wallet.

643
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,760
If I was in your shoes, I probably wouldn't even be able to eat.

644
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Though I'm sure words can't express just how awful you must feel.

645
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,320
Oh, I feel so awful, Kana.

646
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,760
I might need some... some affection right now.

647
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,780
Alright, I've got it!

648
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,140
I'm gonna do my absolute best in order for you to get back on your feet.

649
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,880
Oh my gosh, she's gonna give me personal attention!

650
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,640
The time you spend here will be of a constant smile.

651
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,960
I can assure you that much.

652
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,720
Oh, don't worry, Kana.

653
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:36,800
This is my own... this is my own personal feeling and want.

654
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,400
She did not influence me at all, guys.

655
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,960
But because of what she said, I must come to the Hostess Club every day now.

656
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,040
Like, out of my own responsibility.

657
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,580
Out of my own personal want.

658
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,960
I will spend every day with her.

659
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,540
Not because of anything she said.

660
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,280
I hope we get along, Haito-kun.

661
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,800
If so, I must not be a burden to you.

662
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,500
Haito-kun, should I get more drinks?

663
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,560
I wanna keep talking to you more.

664
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,060
Oh, Kana, me?

665
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,440
Only me?

666
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,820
Of course!

667
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,620
I would love to extend, Kana.

668
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,300
But because the Boss...

669
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,340
Oh, I know you can't do anything about it, Kana.

670
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,920
The Boss is required.

671
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,880
It's regulations.

672
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,380
I know, and I don't wanna get you fired, Kana.

673
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,680
I would absolutely pay more to extend my time with you.

674
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,740
Thank you.

675
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:36,980
Thank you.

676
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,420
I thought you were going home already.

677
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,300
What drink did you want?

678
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,880
Oh, Kana, did you... do you like the rustic?

679
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,480
Oh wait, I'll order something cheap.

680
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,040
I'm gonna let the...

681
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Ooh, okay, I'm gonna get... beer.

682
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:56,400
I like how beer is in such a fancy glass cup.

683
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,520
What was it called?

684
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,220
Glassware.

685
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,960
I was like, is this still a cup?

686
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,460
I swear there's a different name for this.

687
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,300
But it's so fancy for beer.

688
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,560
Alright, we'll get orange juice.

689
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,320
I hope there's alcohol in here.

690
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,880
From Cassie's Liquor & Specialty.

691
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,260
Orange juice.

692
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,140
With a low alcohol percentage.

693
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,700
It is popular among women.

694
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,800
Okay, I'm gonna grab this.

695
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,720
Yeah, champagne glass.

696
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,820
Can I have some too?

697
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,760
Oh, don't worry.

698
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,160
You deserve the very best, my queen.

699
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,140
You get the rustic.

700
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,340
How much money do I have left?

701
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,760
30,000.

702
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,960
Okay, I don't need to eat.

703
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,560
Guys, it's okay.

704
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,460
I don't need to eat for the... I just go to the convening.

705
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,640
Every day for food.

706
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,840
It's okay, guys.

707
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,580
I just need to... I just need to go to the convene...

708
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,880
I can just eat at the convening every other day until my paycheck, guys.

709
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,300
It's okay.

710
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,300
Really?

711
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,240
Thank you.

712
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,520
I'll get you a bottle.

713
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,080
James Japanese Salary Man bankruptcy simulator.

714
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,040
Thank you for the super chat.

715
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,500
Thank you.

716
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,560
Should we eat together?

717
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,060
Kana?

718
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,980
Should we... Should we eat together?

719
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,940
Oh my god.

720
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,320
Okay.

721
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,420
Let's grab something nice.

722
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,740
Oh my god.

723
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,020
We can share...

724
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,700
We can share parfait together, Kana.

725
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,500
Yeah!

726
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,300
It tastes amazing.

727
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,420
I love this.

728
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,260
Oh, you wanna... You want some too?

729
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,240
Stare...

730
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,680
You're staring again.

731
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,460
Stream extension?

732
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,720
Adrian, thank you for the super chat.

733
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,320
Thank you.

734
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,940
Thank you.

735
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,060
If you think about it, it's... Okay.

736
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,760
This is...

737
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,900
Okay.

738
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,720
I'm gonna say something that's like a bit fucked up.

739
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,480
But like the stream extension thing...

740
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,240
Sort of reminds me of...

741
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,880
Subathons.

742
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,880
It's sort of like... Subathons.

743
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,560
Because you're subbing to extend the stream.

744
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,440
Sorry.

745
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,600
Maybe I have a bad habit of...

746
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,020
Staring at things like that and trick...

747
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,400
I trick her, guys.

748
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,660
Don't tell me.

749
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,380
I have...

750
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,560
Bed hair or something?

751
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,760
No.

752
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,060
Not like that.

753
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,460
No.

754
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,300
It's...

755
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,420
Nothing like that.

756
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,180
I thought this...

757
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,940
When I first saw you, Haito-kun...

758
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,600
But...

759
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,900
You seem like a really kind...

760
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,620
Only me...

761
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,280
This is the first time you told this to anybody.

762
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,980
Right, Kana?

763
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,700
Really?

764
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,740
I don't know if I am.

765
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,940
Do you want more of my money?

766
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,300
It's only been a little bit...

767
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,840
Since we first met.

768
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,500
So I don't know for sure.

769
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,520
But I'm just talking about first impression.

770
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,680
Oh my god!

771
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,340
I knew I was naturally kind-hearted.

772
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,680
I knew it.

773
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,840
But I do have a feeling you're really kind.

774
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,880
My first impressions tend to be accurate, you know?

775
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,140
I knew it.

776
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,160
I bet you I'm the first person to see you said this too.

777
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,960
I knew it.

778
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,640
I fucking knew it.

779
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,340
Your eyes especially.

780
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,280
They seem so kind.

781
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,660
So gentle.

782
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,880
Stare.

783
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,480
Hey!

784
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,480
It's no fair for you to stare back!

785
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,120
I'm gonna get all flustered!

786
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,080
Can you keep drinking, Haito-kun?

787
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,900
Don't push yourself, okay?

788
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,220
X, thank you for the 50 GIFTED CHIPS!

789
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,180
Thank you!

790
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,840
Thank you!

791
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,500
Oh my god!

792
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,040
And just like that, X has extended my time with you guys.

793
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,540
Remember to thank...

794
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,060
Thank you for the gifted chips.

795
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,960
Would you like to...

796
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,840
Of course!

797
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,580
Of course!

798
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,900
Because my dragoons extended my time with them.

799
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,180
So I will extend my time with you, Kana.

800
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,640
Yay!

801
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,120
You're gonna stay a bit longer!

802
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,980
What drink did you want?

803
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,560
Oh, um...

804
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,900
I don't know how much money I spent.

805
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,600
Don't worry.

806
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,440
I'll drink the...

807
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,740
Udon Highball.

808
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,980
A specially selected soju mixed with Udon Tini.

809
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,560
It's a very easy drink and has a rich flavor and lovely scent.

810
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,960
Okay.

811
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,120
Oh, don't worry.

812
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,500
Don't worry.

813
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,820
Okay, I'm a little... sort of...

814
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,720
Um...

815
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,060
I'm a little sort of broke right now.

816
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,060
So I hope it's okay that I go 5,000 Yen cheaper.

817
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,940
Uh...

818
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,600
Hahahaha!

819
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,560
You can change, girl.

820
00:36:59,560 --> 00:36:59,820
No!

821
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,420
I refuse!

822
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,300
I refuse to change, girls!

823
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,560
She is my new Oshii.

824
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,180
Because she showed me just a little bit of attention and kindness.

825
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,780
And now I'm hers forever.

826
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:14,860
Um...

827
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,800
Doki Kana Extension Fund.

828
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,660
Katnip, thank you for the super chat.

829
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,820
Thank you, thank you.

830
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,900
Yup, yup.

831
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,780
It tastes great.

832
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,360
Oh, yes.

833
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,680
Oh, look up here, guys.

834
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,620
Hahahaha!

835
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,500
Wait, I can actually move it.

836
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,520
Hahahaha!

837
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,980
Mike, thank you for the Aka soup.

838
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,420
Thank you, thank you.

839
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,580
I need female attention.

840
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,340
Hahahaha!

841
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,280
Joshua, thank you for the Magenta soup.

842
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,880
Thank you, thank you.

843
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,640
Do you think they are fake or what?

844
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,800
How dare you!

845
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,560
Those are not...

846
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,640
That is a natural hair color.

847
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,780
Joshua, how dare you!

848
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,780
This is all natural hair color.

849
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,100
Because that is exactly what you're trying to ask for, right?

850
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,780
Let's get to know more about her personality.

851
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,440
Hahahaha!

852
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,180
Oh.

853
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,780
Did you hear that?

854
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,120
You heard that, didn't you?

855
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,080
Be honest with me.

856
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,620
You heard that, right?

857
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,580
We heard what?

858
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,760
That sounded like it came from your stomach.

859
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,580
Oh, so you did hear that.

860
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,300
I'm hungry, okay?

861
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,380
You can't blame me.

862
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
Oh my gosh!

863
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,240
Are they not feeding you here?

864
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,480
Oh, guys, I'm also so hungry.

865
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,320
Hahahaha!

866
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,800
What should I eat when I get home?

867
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,960
I wonder.

868
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,460
Hahahaha!

869
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,600
Are you planning on buying something?

870
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,860
Are you planning on buying something on your way home?

871
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,780
Are you going to cook?

872
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,280
Hahahaha!

873
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,620
What do you think?

874
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,960
Why don't we make this a little quiz?

875
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,920
How hungry.

876
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,800
Do I tend to cook more?

877
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,200
Or am I the type to resort to buying pre-made stuff?

878
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,720
Or do I go out to eat a lot?

879
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,420
Oh, God.

880
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,560
Okay, this is a bit difficult.

881
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,760
My little hint to you is that I love eating rice in particular.

882
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,580
I could probably just eat white rice for an entire meal.

883
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,080
Oh, God.

884
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,580
Okay, wait.

885
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,100
I'm a woman.

886
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,620
I know this.

887
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,100
I feel like that isn't really much of a hint.

888
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,540
You're right.

889
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,120
But come on!

890
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,060
Answer my question!

891
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,140
Okay.

892
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,400
I think I should say cook often.

893
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,940
Because, like, if you're a woman, you're not supposed to cook often.

894
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,720
If I say buy pre-made food a lot, she'll just be like, what, you think I can't cook for myself?

895
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,840
So, like, I'm going to say cook often.

896
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,560
Good!

897
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,420
I knew it!

898
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,500
I'm a woman!

899
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,100
Kinda.

900
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,500
Good work!

901
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,100
Eating a ton of rice is the way to do it.

902
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,480
Right?

903
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,760
You can eat as much as you want at home.

904
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,040
Oh, what?

905
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,740
They were all correct.

906
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,100
I was just never was going to...

907
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,360
Okay.

908
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,420
Okay.

909
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,980
Don't take this away from me, Kana.

910
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,140
To be honest, all of those options are correct.

911
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,140
So, depending on my mood, I'll cook, buy food, or eat out.

912
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,320
Wait, what's the point of this quiz?

913
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,880
No, no, of course not!

914
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,740
It was not boring!

915
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,900
I mean, there's no incorrect answers.

916
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,720
I can't think of a kind of quiz to give you.

917
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,720
So right, Kana!

918
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,160
Thank you so much, Kana!

919
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,560
For giving me such a generous quiz!

920
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,080
When you say it like that, I guess it was pretty fun.

921
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,620
Joshua, thank you for the magenta soup.

922
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,020
Thank you, thank you!

923
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,420
Everything in this establishment is a scam.

924
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,540
The balance, the drinks, you just drink a flashing... flaming moe in the slots.

925
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,620
Can't win!

926
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,640
But I got...

927
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,540
But I got personal attention.

928
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:26,720
I'm so sorry.

929
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,900
That's enough of a win for me, Joshua.

930
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,140
She is here to make me smile.

931
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,180
I got you the smile, Hito-kun!

932
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,240
No, no.

933
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,400
It's not done.

934
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,740
It's already this late?

935
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,720
No, Hito!

936
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,300
Don't!

937
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,940
I spent so much money, Hito.

938
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,840
No!

939
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,040
Oh my God!

940
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,540
Hahahaha.

941
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,360
Oh my god!

942
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,040
How much is that in US guys?

943
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,340
How much is that in US?

944
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,780
God damn please!

945
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,420
Oh wait, that's just the cover track.

946
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,720
I sent it three times.

947
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,460
Oh, I bought three rustics.

948
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,100
It's okay, it was worth it for her happiness.

949
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,580
If you can please the cast members in the shop, they will...

950
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:25,920
$320?!

951
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,280
$320?!

952
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,660
For Kana's... for Kana.

953
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,720
For Kana.

954
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,960
For Kana.

955
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,780
If you can please the cast members in the shop, they will see you out in a good...

956
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,900
Look, they're so happy!

957
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,740
Haito who is sent off is more motivated to work and earn a higher salary for one week.

958
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,540
See guys?

959
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,300
This is a good thing.

960
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:56,700
I am making... like now I will earn more money for my... for Haito.

961
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,820
Oh wait, no for me.

962
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,380
For Kana.

963
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,820
I will earn more money for Kana.

964
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,080
High motivation for work can lead to a raise and an increase in base salary.

965
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,460
So what she is doing is not wrong.

966
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,260
It is morally right because it's making me richer.

967
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,980
Thank you for today!

968
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,720
See you later!

969
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,580
Yeah, thanks for everything!

970
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,760
See you soon!

971
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,920
I'll be back tomorrow.

972
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,560
It was such a nice place and this customer service was great!

973
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,920
Maybe I'll go there for the time being.

974
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,580
Honestly?

975
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,080
I thought it was pretty good.

976
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,440
Alright guys.

977
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,200
Okay, I have 10,000 yen.

978
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,280
And like I feel like... I can gift a member a vacation.

979
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,380
Like with me, right?

980
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,180
Like...

981
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,940
Oh my god.

982
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,080
Okay.

983
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,380
Alright, let us... let us go gambling.

984
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,000
You can try gambling.

985
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,620
Of course, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

986
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,700
Keep your fingers crossed and consider taking on the challenge.

987
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,560
Alright, we need to make money for Kana.

988
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,020
Epsilon, thank you for the super chat.

989
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,940
Thank you, thank you.

990
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
Haito is a shi...

991
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,820
Don't say that about my girl!

992
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,960
Just because she's giving me attention and not you, does not mean she's filled with lies.

993
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,420
You don't understand!

994
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,700
You never got Haito's attention!

995
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,620
Oh shit, that's it?

996
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,260
Oh my god, I gotta...

997
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,880
Like they all say in gambling, when you're already winning, you gotta keep going.

998
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,120
That's what they all say.

999
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,540
Kana extension fee, but...

1000
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,800
Justine, thank you.

1001
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,700
Thank you for the super chat.

1002
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,840
Thank you, thank you.

1003
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,840
Okay, but what if I... what if I can double it?

1004
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,600
That's what they all say.

1005
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,020
Never quit while you're ahead.

1006
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,720
Wait, I'm Haito.

1007
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:05,960
Sorry.

1008
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,640
Sorry, Kana like messed up my brain a little bit.

1009
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,880
I can't tell if I'm Kana or Haito anymore.

1010
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,140
I can't tell.

1011
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,160
Okay.

1012
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,280
Here we go.

1013
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,760
Alright.

1014
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,100
Everyone quits right before they hit it big.

1015
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,680
Exactly.

1016
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,320
And that is why you're right.

1017
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,200
Look at that.

1018
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,140
Everyone quits before they hit it big.

1019
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,360
Come on, come on, give me that money.

1020
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,660
Noooo.

1021
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,270
Okay, but like, you can't end on a loss.

1022
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,110
You can't end on a loss, guys.

1023
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,410
Gambling?

1024
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:50,870
Gambling.

1025
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,050
It's white, that means good.

1026
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,070
What?

1027
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,290
What?

1028
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,370
Guys, you can't end on a loss!

1029
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:58,210
It's okay, I have convenience.

1030
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,610
Oh gosh!

1031
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:08,430
Yeah!

1032
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,570
Oh my god, 30!

1033
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,030
Okay, now I should stop though.

1034
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,690
Thank you, thank you!

1035
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:25,230
Happy birthday to you!

1036
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,990
Happy birthday to you!

1037
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,530
Happy birthday dear...

1038
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,410
Okay, um...

1039
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,050
Oh sorry, we ran out of time, Zecra.

1040
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,270
But my boss said that like...

1041
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:34,910
I'm joking.

1042
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,530
Happy birthday dear Zecra!

1043
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,230
Happy birthday to you!

1044
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:39,910
Yay!

1045
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,650
Alright, we gotta buy a gift for...

1046
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:46,230
for...

1047
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,130
for Kana.

1048
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,790
You can purchase...

1049
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,270
gifts to give to the cast on rare occasions.

1050
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,450
The lineup may change.

1051
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,670
Guys, what do you think Kana would like?

1052
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,770
Oh my god, do you think...

1053
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,050
Oh, I think she'll love a plush toy.

1054
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,030
Oh, she seems like a girl that...

1055
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,530
that likes plushies.

1056
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,230
Oh my god, the lux...

1057
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,970
Okay, not gonna lie, she'll definitely like a luxurious bag.

1058
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,390
I shouldn't buy makeup, cause then I'll be like...

1059
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,310
She'll be like, what, you think I need makeup?

1060
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,330
I shouldn't buy flowers, because flowers will eventually die.

1061
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,490
So I think...

1062
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,470
I'm gonna spend all my money...

1063
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,670
on a plush toy.

1064
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:20,570
There we go.

1065
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,290
I won this by gambling.

1066
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:23,870
It's okay guys.

1067
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:25,030
It's okay.

1068
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:26,670
I can...

1069
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:27,150
Okay, continue.

1070
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:28,750
Okay, wait, how do I get out of the store?

1071
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,630
It's an expensive plushie.

1072
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:35,830
It's okay, I win it all back by gambling.

1073
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:39,790
Come on.

1074
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,270
Come on, big money.

1075
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,370
Big money!

1076
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,350
There's no way I could lose.

1077
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:48,590
Okay.

1078
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:52,510
Okay.

1079
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:52,730
Okay.

1080
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:55,790
I might be in debt, but I can get out of debt by gambling.

1081
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:00,010
It's okay.

1082
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,570
I can get out of...

1083
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,530
back out of...

1084
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,330
I can get out of debt by gambling.

1085
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,310
If you keep winning.

1086
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:07,810
Oh.

1087
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,870
I told you.

1088
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:10,430
Yes.

1089
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:11,690
Yes.

1090
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,550
X, thank you for the 50 gifted chips.

1091
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:13,970
Thank you.

1092
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:14,490
Thank you.

1093
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:14,690
Guys.

1094
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,610
Guys, we gotta get out of debt.

1095
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,070
Guys, we gotta get out of debt.

1096
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,630
It's the only way.

1097
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:24,350
Okay.

1098
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,430
Guys, don't worry.

1099
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,450
I can get out of debt, guys.

1100
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,210
The loan shark that I borrowed this money from said that like...

1101
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:35,090
Said I just need to pay it back by tonight, guys.

1102
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:35,590
It's okay.

1103
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,950
I don't need my knees.

1104
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:38,250
Oh!

1105
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,330
Guys, I'll be fine.

1106
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,350
It can't get worse.

1107
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:45,410
It can't...

1108
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,470
Guys, it can't get worse.

1109
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,130
Don't worry.

1110
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,050
Eventually, I'll hit it big.

1111
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,730
You just gotta take more chances.

1112
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,130
Oh, thank God.

1113
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:56,490
Okay.

1114
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:57,130
Okay.

1115
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,150
I can win again.

1116
00:48:58,530 --> 00:48:59,350
I can...

1117
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,890
No, don't gamble, Doki.

1118
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:01,970
You'll lose all your money.

1119
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:02,870
What money?

1120
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,690
I don't know if you see the red sign on the top, right?

1121
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,670
Court Jester.

1122
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,250
Thank you for the super chat.

1123
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:11,630
Thank you.

1124
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,170
Thank you.

1125
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:12,710
Thank you.

1126
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:12,730
Thank you.

1127
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,330
Thank you.

1128
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,410
Oh, the day's over.

1129
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,210
But I haven't finished gambling!

1130
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,650
The day's over.

1131
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,790
I've gotta borrow some money!

1132
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,010
You spend more than you'll have.

1133
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:30,890
You'll have a racked up debt and might even get visited by some scary people.

1134
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:33,110
Let's avoid getting into debt.

1135
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,970
Oh, thank God.

1136
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,450
Guys, it's okay.

1137
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,210
It's okay, guys.

1138
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,810
My job...

1139
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,090
My job clutched it out for me.

1140
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:44,070
I need to enter...

1141
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:44,310
Okay, guys.

1142
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:44,990
Can you see...

1143
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,230
I need to go see Kana.

1144
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:48,370
Kana!

1145
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,650
I shaved, brushed my teeth, and got the wrinkles out of my clothes.

1146
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,190
Okay, I'm good.

1147
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,630
Let's go into the shop.

1148
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,630
Keep gambling!

1149
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,770
Yes, I'm okay!

1150
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,910
Wait, where's Kana?

1151
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,070
She's away on Saturday!

1152
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,870
Okay, note this up.

1153
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:10,730
Don't go see...

1154
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,090
Go to the bunny garden on Saturday.

1155
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:13,830
Okay, guys.

1156
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:13,850
I'm good.

1157
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:13,910
I'm good.

1158
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,450
Why not having a conversation with other cast...

1159
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,710
It's not the same.

1160
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,210
The cast member who likes you the most will serve you immediately after you enter.

1161
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,930
Increase your likability and you might end up...

1162
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,350
Like...

1163
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,570
End up with...

1164
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,030
Like...

1165
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,870
Married?

1166
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:35,590
Kana would...

1167
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:37,790
Marry me?

1168
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,330
Back?

1169
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:44,290
Doki, you may want to call in-game 1-800-GAME.

1170
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1171
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:46,670
Thank you.

1172
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,270
Thank you.

1173
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,590
What drink did you want?

1174
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,230
It's not the same.

1175
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,430
Can I have a drink with you?

1176
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,190
You don't even bother me up!

1177
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:02,990
Okay, I'll give you...

1178
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,790
You're gonna have the same drink as me.

1179
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,150
You have to earn this.

1180
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:08,490
You weren't my first.

1181
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:13,390
So you have to try even harder to earn this money that I have here.

1182
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,190
17,000 yen.

1183
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,030
I really love this.

1184
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,450
I mean, it's so yummy.

1185
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,000
Sorry guys, you gotta extend your time.

1186
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,940
Okay.

1187
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,880
Let's have a conversation.

1188
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,480
I mean...

1189
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,460
Yeah, I have the music in my notebook, too.

1190
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,780
For now.

1191
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,400
Wait a second.

1192
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,500
You're pretty cute.

1193
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,540
But why are you curled in a boxer?

1194
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,880
What's wrong?

1195
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,000
Well...

1196
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,840
I was here for Kana.

1197
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,700
You don't even know my name.

1198
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,640
You must be nervous.

1199
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,180
That's no good.

1200
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,860
Getting nervous over me is just a waste of energy.

1201
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,140
Oh, hello.

1202
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,460
Your name is Kana.

1203
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,040
The name is Haidokanda.

1204
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,220
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

1205
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,060
That's hilarious.

1206
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,060
You started introducing yourself...

1207
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,360
No, she's making fun of me!

1208
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,340
Well then.

1209
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,000
I will too.

1210
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,300
Hello, I'm Rin.

1211
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,720
I'm sorry to trouble you.

1212
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,920
What am I doing?

1213
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,380
Is this how it's supposed to go?

1214
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,960
She's laughing at me, guys!

1215
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,940
What is Hai-chan doing?

1216
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,920
She makes me feel emasculated.

1217
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,380
So what do you do, Hai-chan?

1218
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,720
But she called me Hai-chan, so it's all better now.

1219
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,560
Right now, I'm assisting an acquaintance with their job.

1220
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,580
But until recently, I was employed at her company.

1221
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,100
However...

1222
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,040
How abusive!

1223
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,440
Keep doing that!

1224
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:12,920
Get it!

1225
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,920
Fire up!

1226
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,240
Due to a plethora of mistakes, I was terminated.

1227
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,540
Hang on.

1228
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,320
Hai-chan, I can't keep up with all that formal speech.

1229
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,700
I'd be super grateful if you just talk normally.

1230
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,200
Hana wouldn't laugh at me.

1231
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,740
Really?

1232
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,420
I'll drop the pretenses then.

1233
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,060
Thank you!

1234
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,500
Hai-chan is a kind person.

1235
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,880
Thank you!

1236
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,880
You're such a nice guy, Hai-chan!

1237
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,560
If they're lost for firing you, you're better off without them.

1238
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,160
You're right, Rin!

1239
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,160
They made a fucking mistake!

1240
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,560
No...

1241
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,340
Oh, okay, never mind.

1242
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:58,880
She's not right.

1243
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,640
No, they treated me pretty well.

1244
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,600
I'm getting by okay now.

1245
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,820
You're so great, Hai-chan.

1246
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,760
I respect you for not saying bad things about the company you're in charge of.

1247
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,900
I respect you for not saying bad things about the company you're in charge of.

1248
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,780
Wow, you're really something, Hai-chan.

1249
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,660
You won't badmouth them even after getting fired?

1250
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,260
I respect that.

1251
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,120
You're a good person, Hai-chan.

1252
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,280
You're a kind, kind, and good person.

1253
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,520
You're a stand-up guy.

1254
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,160
You must get that a lot, huh?

1255
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,620
Oh...

1256
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,580
Let me hear some more.

1257
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,080
I don't get that at all.

1258
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,940
My self-esteem is so bad.

1259
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,740
Why don't you help me?

1260
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,180
Help me out.

1261
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,920
There it is again.

1262
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,040
What's the name for it?

1263
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,080
Humanity?

1264
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,440
Oh, what was it?

1265
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,360
It starts with an H.

1266
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,940
Humility!

1267
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:57,740
That's it!

1268
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,960
Oh, hey, let me tell you something.

1269
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:08,980
I'm serious.

1270
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,680
Well, I'm always serious.

1271
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,260
But now I'm seriously serious.

1272
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,140
Meeting new people is really important, right?

1273
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,860
In life?

1274
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,760
I mean, so I'm really grateful to have met you, Hai-chan.

1275
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,780
I may be far from perfect.

1276
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,840
But I'll still do the very best I can.

1277
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,160
I hope you're ready.

1278
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,390
Oh my god!

1279
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,580
How embarrassing.

1280
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,980
What am I saying?

1281
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,080
I'm so silly.

1282
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,440
Well, you get the idea.

1283
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,220
Did you catch all that?

1284
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,820
I won't say it again.

1285
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,780
By the way, the other girls here are all really good.

1286
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,980
They're really nice, too.

1287
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,800
So I think you'll like this shop a lot.

1288
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,440
Oh my gosh, she's so nice.

1289
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,900
She knows that she's not for me.

1290
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,940
She doesn't care because I already spent money on her.

1291
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,260
Did you find that I'm not your type after talking to me a few times?

1292
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,360
Feel free to slide up next to another girl instead.

1293
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,900
I'm not that type of girl.

1294
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,240
Oh, it's because she...

1295
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,400
You know it's because she has all the customers she can handle already.

1296
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,280
She doesn't need more customers, guys.

1297
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,120
You know Rin has already got some high rollers.

1298
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,760
She fucking knows.

1299
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,440
She knows I'm broke.

1300
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,380
So she's encouraging me to look at other girls.

1301
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,220
Because she's like, this man bought me an 800 yen...

1302
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,900
This man bought me an 800 yen glass of alcohol.

1303
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,380
It's okay if you want to talk to other girls.

1304
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,600
She's too high-calorie.

1305
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,800
She's too rich for me.

1306
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,660
I'm not her... I don't meet her standards.

1307
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,140
I miss Kana.

1308
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,400
She doesn't want to waste her time on small fry.

1309
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,840
I'm the small fry.

1310
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,880
If I'm not your type, it'd make me pretty happy.

1311
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,260
I'm not your type.

1312
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:42,940
It'd make me pretty happy.

1313
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,380
I'm not your type.

1314
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380
It'd make me pretty happy.

1315
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,720
Well, I'll leave it at that for now.

1316
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,240
With that said, I'll look forward to serving you, Hai-chan!

1317
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,160
Okay, I want to talk to a blue girl here.

1318
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,700
Oh, dang.

1319
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,520
Time totally flies when I'm with you, Hai-chan.

1320
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,780
What should I do?

1321
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,080
Will you stay with me for a few more rounds?

1322
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,520
No.

1323
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,020
When did it get so late?

1324
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,800
I guess I'll head back soon.

1325
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,580
Wait, I just leave?

1326
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,200
I want to talk to her!

1327
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,400
I want to talk to her!

1328
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,480
What do you mean I just leave?

1329
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,680
What do you mean I just leave?

1330
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,160
What do you mean I just leave?

1331
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,900
Thanks for everything.

1332
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,040
See you soon.

1333
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:32,820
No!

1334
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,700
I can't believe it.

1335
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,480
I can't believe it.

1336
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:42,660
Guys...

1337
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,360
Guys, I don't...

1338
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,980
Guys, I'm so... Okay, maybe she'll be back.

1339
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,520
It's not Saturday, right?

1340
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,340
Who's birthday?

1341
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:51,760
Who's she?

1342
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,280
Somebody's birthday?

1343
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,620
Wait, what?

1344
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:56,960
Okay.

1345
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,900
Okay, there's nothing special.

1346
00:58:59,060 --> 00:58:59,520
It's Sunday.

1347
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:00,140
Is she there?

1348
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,320
Kana!

1349
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,760
That is my time to rest and recover.

1350
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,340
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

1351
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:06,920
Kana!

1352
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,720
Kana, are you here?

1353
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,260
Kana!

1354
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,940
Oh my god!

1355
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,520
Wait, they're both the same size.

1356
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,920
Oh my god!

1357
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,120
Oh my god!

1358
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,380
It looks like they fucking...

1359
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,840
put a guacamole there.

1360
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,400
Thanks for visiting me today.

1361
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,840
I meant same size ears, guys.

1362
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:32,740
I meant...

1363
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,700
same size ears, guys.

1364
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,020
Their ears are the same size.

1365
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,420
Um...

1366
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,040
Thanks for visiting me today.

1367
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,960
What drink did you want?

1368
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,940
I'll take the...

1369
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,160
I'll take the orange.

1370
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,460
Then...

1371
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,520
Don't we want to drink too, Kana?

1372
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,520
Don't worry, don't worry.

1373
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,900
I saved up just for you, Kana.

1374
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,080
Do you want the...

1375
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,600
bunny punch?

1376
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,780
Okay, I might be a little...

1377
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,740
I'm a little broke, so...

1378
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,120
Oh, maybe some vintage umeshu.

1379
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,180
You like that?

1380
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,300
Oh!

1381
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,820
She loves that!

1382
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:12,960
Guys, write it down!

1383
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,400
This is what Kana likes!

1384
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,440
Write it down!

1385
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,140
The vintage kamashu.

1386
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,320
Okay, I'll give you guys...

1387
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:23,960
Okay.

1388
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:26,740
Kana!

1389
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,080
Kana, Kana, Kana!

1390
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:28,900
I bought you...

1391
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,640
a gift, Kana!

1392
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,260
I bought you a gift!

1393
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,860
If it's okay, would you be willing to...

1394
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,500
accept this?

1395
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,840
I hope...

1396
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
you like it.

1397
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,180
Oh!

1398
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,200
She... I knew it!

1399
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:42,780
I fucking...

1400
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,340
knew it!

1401
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,680
I knew what women want!

1402
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,440
Can I really have it?

1403
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,720
I'm so happy!

1404
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,440
Thank you!

1405
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,560
We have to take care of it.

1406
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,360
What's wrong?

1407
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,600
You seem puzzled.

1408
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,560
Not now.

1409
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,960
I'm concentrating really hard on something, so...

1410
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,960
don't talk to me right now.

1411
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:10,860
Kana, what?

1412
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,940
Why would you say that, Kana?

1413
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,160
Huh?

1414
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,080
I got it!

1415
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:17,820
Got it!

1416
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,420
You're right, Kana!

1417
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,660
You're right, Kana!

1418
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,240
You're right, Kana!

1419
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:28,270
I was gone for one day!

1420
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,650
Kana, you're right, Kana!

1421
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:37,490
Yep, yep.

1422
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:39,930
You definitely are.

1423
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,590
There's no mistake.

1424
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:42,690
It's okay.

1425
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,650
She's just being silly, guys.

1426
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,230
It's a joke, guys.

1427
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,970
So that's what you got.

1428
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:54,990
You forgot my name and was desperately trying to remember it?

1429
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,430
Guys, no, she didn't...

1430
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,250
She didn't mean it, guys.

1431
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,830
Guys, she didn't...

1432
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:01,570
She was just joking with me.

1433
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:02,850
Right, Kana?

1434
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:05,110
See?

1435
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:06,370
I knew it!

1436
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,730
I knew she was joking!

1437
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,710
That's not true.

1438
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,550
I knew from the very beginning.

1439
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:17,630
I swore I knew you were an important customer to me.

1440
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,590
Of course I knew you wouldn't remember it, Kana!

1441
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:21,230
Of course I knew you wouldn't remember it, Kana!

1442
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:21,930
I knew it!

1443
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,010
I knew it!

1444
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,250
I almost believed the haters out there.

1445
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:30,730
But my dedication to you would never unwaver, Kana.

1446
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:37,250
Even if you name slipped my mind, I'd remember it instantly.

1447
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,850
Because you're Heito-kun.

1448
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,050
And I know you are.

1449
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,150
You're Haito-kun, right?

1450
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,950
Yes, I'm Haito-kun!

1451
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:51,750
I am... actually... I am Haito.

1452
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,770
I am Haito!

1453
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:54,350
See?

1454
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,990
I told you I'll get your room.

1455
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,310
There's no way I'd forget it.

1456
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:04,750
That was a relief.

1457
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:06,530
JP, thank you for the super chat.

1458
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:07,470
Thank you, thank you.

1459
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:08,010
No!

1460
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:12,110
She was playing a funny joke on me and it was so funny!

1461
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,550
Anyways, don't worry about me.

1462
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,430
I'll never forget your name anymore.

1463
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,570
So don't worry, okay?

1464
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:21,750
Of course!

1465
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:23,890
I'd never doubted you for the second, Kana.

1466
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:28,470
Thanks, but I'm sure it's really hard for you to remember every customer's name like that.

1467
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:29,190
Exactly, guys!

1468
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,750
She's a very busy girl, chat.

1469
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:36,150
Like, she can't just remember all our names, you know?

1470
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:37,450
Like, she's...

1471
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:38,190
She's so busy!

1472
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,750
She has... This is her job!

1473
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,310
And it's okay if she makes a mistake or two.

1474
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,320
Yeah, I wish you all had name tags on or something, you know?

1475
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,060
Something cute.

1476
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,540
Like what you see a kindergartener wearing.

1477
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,800
I know, Kana!

1478
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,660
You're so right!

1479
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,500
It's our fault that you can't remember our names.

1480
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,460
And it's... And I take full responsibility, Kana.

1481
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,640
I'm only joking, of course.

1482
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,420
I'm a pro in my field.

1483
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,520
Remembering names is my specialty.

1484
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,040
Remembering names is my specialty.

1485
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,900
Well, you did remember my name within seconds before.

1486
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,580
Seems like you're doing great from my eyes.

1487
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:24,140
I am!

1488
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:24,960
I'm so kind!

1489
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,240
You really are kind, aren't you, Haito-kun?

1490
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,400
I'll make sure to never forget your name.

1491
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,100
Look at that!

1492
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,620
And that's how you do it, fellas.

1493
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,300
That's how you... You're in.

1494
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:38,540
That's how you...

1495
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:38,540
You're in.

1496
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,520
Oh my gosh.

1497
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,360
The way she looks at me, though.

1498
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:51,280
When I'm with you, Haito-kun, time just flies by just like that.

1499
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,040
Do you think you'd... Of course!

1500
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:53,580
Of course!

1501
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,660
Do I have the money?

1502
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,840
Yes, I know I do.

1503
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,200
I thought you were going home.

1504
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,540
Of course not, Kana!

1505
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,540
What drink do I want?

1506
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,160
I'll take the 800 yen.

1507
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:06,720
Guys...

1508
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,640
I like how they don't tell you how much you spent.

1509
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,140
So that's how they... This is how they get you as well.

1510
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,020
What does she like again?

1511
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,440
She likes...

1512
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:17,860
Okay.

1513
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,900
She likes this.

1514
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:21,580
Right?

1515
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,940
Yeah, she likes this.

1516
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,520
What do I... I'm gonna buy it again.

1517
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,260
Yes!

1518
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,360
Oh, this is great!

1519
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,140
I love this!

1520
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,600
They knew.

1521
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:31,800
They knew.

1522
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:34,980
They knew.

1523
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,400
Oh my...

1524
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,560
Oh my god.

1525
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,860
How much money did I spend?

1526
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,860
I can't tell.

1527
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,660
They don't even tell you how much money you spent.

1528
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:57,160
So, Haito-kun, what do you like to eat?

1529
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,020
I don't know if I have any particular favorites.

1530
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,140
In fact, I'm really picky and I'll eat almost anything.

1531
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,380
That's why I've been eating every day at the konbini store.

1532
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,840
So I can save my money for you, Kana.

1533
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:10,540
Eh?

1534
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,000
You can eat anything?

1535
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,660
You're seriously not picky at all?

1536
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,500
You mean like stones and trees?

1537
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:18,660
Amazing!

1538
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,780
If I do a video stream, I'll get a lot of views.

1539
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,760
Anything for you.

1540
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,940
So you'd eat up sticks and stones if I bring them to you?

1541
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:26,920
That's amazing.

1542
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,340
You might even go viral if we film that.

1543
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:29,760
Of course.

1544
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:30,840
You know what?

1545
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,720
Sticks and stones aren't even that bad.

1546
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,560
You can make soup out of it.

1547
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,220
I was talking about edible things.

1548
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,640
So what do you like to eat, Kana-chan?

1549
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,060
Oh, that's a question?

1550
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,760
I want to do a quiz to guess what my favorite food is.

1551
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,080
Wait, are you setting me up to make my food preferences into a little quiz?

1552
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,960
You know, I was just genuinely curious.

1553
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,640
But I guess we could make it into a little game if you like.

1554
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,380
Yeah, yeah.

1555
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,180
What's my favorite food?

1556
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:02,700
Sounds great!

1557
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,140
You know I love quizzes.

1558
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,320
So what do you think my favorite food is?

1559
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,160
I like...

1560
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:10,480
Guys...

1561
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,160
Is this gonna be a trick question again?

1562
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,240
Mr. Tooth, thank you for the super chat.

1563
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,120
Thank you, thank you.

1564
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,520
Lucky for us, Doki will never forget our names.

1565
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,700
After all, we have the name tags!

1566
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,280
I told you it was a brilliant idea!

1567
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:27,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1568
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,200
Thank you, thank you.

1569
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:31,860
Sushi?

1570
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,720
Oh, cause she likes rice!

1571
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,840
You're right!

1572
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,900
Guys, R girl.

1573
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:36,780
This is R girl.

1574
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,480
We work together.

1575
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,200
How about sushi?

1576
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,080
When I go to sushi trains...

1577
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,960
I always end up making a tower of empty plates.

1578
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,720
I love sushi, but I can't stop eating it once I start.

1579
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,980
I'm so hungry now that I started thinking about food.

1580
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,400
Kana, do you want food?

1581
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:01,840
Kana?

1582
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,760
Kaito-kun, say something that makes me feel better.

1583
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,500
Please, don't distract me.

1584
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:15,600
At this rate, my head is going to end up being filled with lots of food.

1585
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,340
And I won't be able to concentrate on getting to know you.

1586
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,500
Do you want food?

1587
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,720
A million stars shining in our solar system?

1588
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:31,740
Stars?

1589
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:34,960
Michelin?

1590
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,980
Michelin?

1591
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:36,860
Oh, Michelin stars!

1592
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:37,520
Oh, hahaha!

1593
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,000
It's like, Calvin?

1594
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,660
Michelin stars!

1595
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,780
No, I can't take my mind off food!

1596
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,180
How about history then?

1597
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,680
You know, famous Japanese battles?

1598
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,260
I'm just sure that won't lead back to food.

1599
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:54,760
History...

1600
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,660
In the past...

1601
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,160
In the Edo period...

1602
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:00,580
Ninja...

1603
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:02,700
Monja...

1604
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,700
How does she know about Michelin stars?

1605
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:04,940
Oh, okay!

1606
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,360
Oh no!

1607
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,440
Oh no!

1608
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,300
She has high taste, guys!

1609
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,200
Hahaha!

1610
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,040
History...

1611
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,360
Ancient times...

1612
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,780
The Edo period...

1613
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,060
And ninjas!

1614
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,980
Mmm... Traditional Japanese street food!

1615
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,100
I guess anything I say right now is just going to lead back to food somehow.

1616
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,780
Kaito-kun, what about alcohol?

1617
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,000
I'm still okay.

1618
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,940
Guys, do I have 3,000 yen?

1619
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:29,780
Hahaha!

1620
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,280
Should I get you more drinks?

1621
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,400
I can keep going, but only continue if I want to.

1622
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,860
Guys, do I have 3,000 yen?

1623
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,040
This is important!

1624
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,680
Hahaha!

1625
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,680
No!

1626
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,220
I'm sorry, Kanna!

1627
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,920
I'm broke for the day!

1628
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,400
Hahaha!

1629
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,500
I'm sorry!

1630
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,700
It's getting late!

1631
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,760
I should go home soon!

1632
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,240
But don't worry, I'll be back with more money!

1633
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,600
Oh my god, I definitely did not have 3,000 yen!

1634
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:06,700
Hahaha!

1635
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,220
It's okay!

1636
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,480
Another day of convenience!

1637
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,620
Thank you for today!

1638
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,700
See you soon!

1639
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,560
Thank you for today!

1640
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,880
I had a great, fun conversation!

1641
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,380
I'm looking forward to going to work now!

1642
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,680
Oh my god, thank you, Kanna!

1643
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,880
You made me richer!

1644
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,880
I got 57,000 yen!

1645
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,580
Yay!

1646
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,100
That means it's another day!

1647
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:41,480
But what if I...

1648
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,100
Guys, guys, okay...

1649
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,440
Don't... guys...

1650
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,400
All I'm saying is that...

1651
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,040
Is that as everybody knows when it comes to gambling...

1652
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,200
Um...

1653
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,120
Hahaha!

1654
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,620
You never quit when you're ahead!

1655
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,140
Hahaha!

1656
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,720
There's no way I could lose this time!

1657
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,160
There's no way!

1658
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,020
I've hit all my bad luck!

1659
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,060
I used up all the bad luck, so it's only up from now!

1660
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,080
It's red because it means good, right?

1661
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,340
Oh, it's okay!

1662
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,580
It's only 10,000!

1663
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,020
Guys, it's only 10,000 yen!

1664
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:14,460
So that means like this next one...

1665
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,360
This next one is gonna be like 20,000 plus!

1666
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,820
And I'll be up... I'll be plussed!

1667
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,060
I knew it!

1668
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:23,880
There you go!

1669
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,200
I'm fu...

1670
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:25,980
There you go, guys!

1671
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:26,300
See?

1672
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,200
See?

1673
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,060
You never end on a loss, chat!

1674
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,940
You never end on a loss!

1675
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,380
Alright, let's see...

1676
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,620
Plus 12,000 yen...

1677
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,760
I'm gonna buy another...

1678
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,480
I'm gonna buy another gift for...

1679
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,060
For Kana!

1680
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,780
To remember our names and what's based on food!

1681
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:43,740
We'll see!

1682
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,840
Thank you for the super chat!

1683
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:45,280
Thank you!

1684
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:45,880
Thank you!

1685
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,120
Okay...

1686
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:47,880
I think...

1687
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,780
Guys, I have enough for a necklace!

1688
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,100
Oh my god!

1689
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:51,900
Guys, guys, guys!

1690
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,540
Guys, I have just enough for a necklace!

1691
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:55,520
I think...

1692
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,300
I think Kana would like this!

1693
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,480
Okay...

1694
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,080
Okay...

1695
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,360
Is today Saturday?

1696
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,840
Okay, guys, we're gonna...

1697
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,060
We're gonna sleep, guys!

1698
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,740
Because Kana's not here!

1699
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:10,920
Kana's not there!

1700
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,980
Kana's not there!

1701
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:13,800
So...

1702
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,460
So...

1703
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,600
We're gonna go sleep!

1704
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,120
I still have enough for a drink!

1705
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:21,780
It's okay!

1706
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:22,360
I'll sleep!

1707
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,540
I'm gonna sleep!

1708
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,820
We don't need food!

1709
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,820
Guys, we don't need food!

1710
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:30,260
We need...

1711
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:31,300
All we need is Kana!

1712
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,520
We'll eat...

1713
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,620
We'll eat only...

1714
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,480
Only at the bunny garden!

1715
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,880
Now is the time to rest up and recover!

1716
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,920
This is the only place that can heal my mind!

1717
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,240
It's okay...

1718
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:45,820
Kana!

1719
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:47,820
I'm back!

1720
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,020
Oh, you came!

1721
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:50,740
Thanks!

1722
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:52,500
Of course, Kana!

1723
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,240
What drink did you want?

1724
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,240
I'll just take the orange.

1725
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,580
I'll just take the cheap one.

1726
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,760
Don't worry!

1727
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,700
I know what you like!

1728
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,400
You like the...

1729
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,600
Guys, how much for a drink?

1730
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,520
How much money do I have left?

1731
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,640
Guys, guys...

1732
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,520
How much money...

1733
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,600
will always come for Kana?

1734
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,580
I have 4,000.

1735
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,880
Okay, we're gonna...

1736
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,760
We're gonna go to...

1737
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,680
We're gonna buy her fine wine.

1738
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,180
Maybe she'll like fine wine.

1739
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,120
I want...

1740
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:32,800
She does!

1741
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:33,940
Oh, this is great!

1742
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,040
I love this!

1743
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,500
She likes wine too and it's cheap.

1744
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,320
It's a little cheaper.

1745
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,900
Joshua, thank you for the magenta soup!

1746
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,460
Thank you, thank you!

1747
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,260
Doki, the slots call you.

1748
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,820
Keep going, Kana can wait.

1749
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,820
The lights are calling!

1750
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:51,800
One person is only here for this game for the gambling.

1751
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:56,900
Not for the main gameplay.

1752
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,500
Kana, Kana, I got you, I got you a diamond necklace.

1753
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,520
A diamond necklace?!

1754
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:09,780
Okay...

1755
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,480
I did not realize I bought a diamond necklace.

1756
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:19,140
Okay, if it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

1757
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,300
I hope you like it.

1758
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,500
I didn't... I didn't...

1759
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,320
Can I really have it?

1760
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,780
I'm so happy!

1761
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,640
Thank you!

1762
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,980
Of course you are, Kana!

1763
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,800
We have to take care of it.

1764
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,720
You seem happy.

1765
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:37,820
Did something happen?

1766
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:45,700
You came all this way to visit me, Haito-kun?

1767
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,520
Of course I'm happy!

1768
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,040
Of course, Kana!

1769
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,660
I don't care about all these other ladies!

1770
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,540
My eyes are only for you!

1771
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,140
Thanks, but...

1772
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,880
You seem much happier than usual.

1773
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:58,820
I see.

1774
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:03,580
I guess I was able to refresh myself.

1775
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:08,480
Maybe it's because I really got some time to relax during my time off recently.

1776
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,100
Lloyd Kurosu says, Thank you for the super chat.

1777
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:11,980
Thank you, thank you.

1778
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:20,880
That weird feeling when your Oshii is losing tons of money to a pretty girl when she doesn't have a huge amount of money to spare right now couldn't be me.

1779
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,800
Thank you for the super chat.

1780
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,000
Thank you, thank you.

1781
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,620
You can use your days off to the fullest then.

1782
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,620
Um...

1783
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,680
Oh shit, um...

1784
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,960
Uh...

1785
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,100
Um...

1786
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,880
Guys, okay...

1787
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,100
I'll say...

1788
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:44,800
Slept in.

1789
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,700
I'm gonna say it, slept in.

1790
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,180
My... my... right?

1791
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,980
Um, no... I don't know!

1792
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,780
No, I do know!

1793
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:57,720
Cause I know what women like.

1794
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,000
Um...

1795
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:01,580
Uh...

1796
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:03,260
Uh...

1797
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,400
Uh, slept in.

1798
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:08,260
Slept in, I assume?

1799
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,900
Ah, I fucking knew it!

1800
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,560
Nooooo!

1801
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,460
Nicholas!

1802
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,920
You can't look at me like that!

1803
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:29,280
It feels amazing to sleep without worrying about alarm.

1804
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,460
The sleeping throughout the whole day feels like a bit of a...

1805
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:33,880
waste.

1806
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,720
You're too young, Kana.

1807
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,020
You don't understand.

1808
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:41,200
The older you get, sleeping in is a fucking luxury.

1809
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,580
I played with my ho- Bro!

1810
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,820
There was no dog in this quiz!

1811
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,120
But it's not your fault, Kana.

1812
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,280
It's not your fault, it had to be my fault.

1813
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,340
I could have asked about the dog.

1814
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:03,440
I played with my dog for the whole day last night.

1815
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,060
Last time I had a day off.

1816
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,080
Oh, you have a dog?

1817
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:11,000
Uh huh.

1818
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:14,000
Oh, she has a chihuahua.

1819
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,320
Not that I'll judge or anything.

1820
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,820
He's a chihuahua called Wawa.

1821
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,140
He's super cute.

1822
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,940
When I call you Wawa-chin, you come up to me with your tail.

1823
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:31,420
When you sleep, we always sleep together in bed.

1824
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,040
And when you call him Wawa-chin, he wags his tail and comes to you.

1825
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,000
When he sleeps, it's always next to me too!

1826
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,120
Bro, like, I was just set up for failure.

1827
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,000
I love walking.

1828
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,200
I'll go

1829
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:52,130
for a walk with you in the park.

1830
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,540
He loves walks too.

1831
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:02,820
So I take him to this really big park near my place whenever I get a day off.

1832
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,580
That's what we did last time too.

1833
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,740
That sounds great.

1834
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,240
I love dogs too.

1835
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:12,560
Really?

1836
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,120
Then someday, I'll give you a nice pat, Wawa-chin.

1837
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:21,590
Well, I hope you give Wawa-chin a nice pat if you ever come around.

1838
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:22,530
I'll be happy to be with you.

1839
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:26,310
I'm sure you'll end up enjoying his company too.

1840
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,470
Do you think he'd be fine around me though?

1841
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:31,530
I don't think so.

1842
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:32,270
It's a chihuahua.

1843
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,590
Chihuahuas hate everybody but their owners.

1844
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,270
I wonder if he'll think I'm trying to take his master away from him.

1845
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,200
Wawa-chin, I love you.

1846
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,320
Who knows?

1847
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,400
That could happen.

1848
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,820
Wawa-chin loves me so much after all.

1849
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,160
It should have been me.

1850
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,040
It should have been me.

1851
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,640
You're trying to steal me away.

1852
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:02,220
I didn't mean like that, Kana.

1853
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,080
But if that's what you want...

1854
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:09,900
What's wrong?

1855
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,660
I'm suddenly feeling hot.

1856
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,030
I'm sweating.

1857
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:20,610
Nothing at all.

1858
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,490
I'm feeling a little sweaty right now actually.

1859
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:25,170
I wonder what's wrong with me.

1860
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,530
Do you think you can still drink?

1861
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:28,630
Guys, do I have enough?

1862
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:33,890
Guys, how much money do I have?

1863
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:35,150
I don't.

1864
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:36,170
I spent a lot.

1865
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:36,750
No.

1866
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:42,410
I don't have enough money.

1867
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:43,610
I'm sorry.

1868
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:46,830
I just have one session.

1869
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:56,450
Okay, but like being in debt for a little bit will be okay.

1870
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,490
It's okay.

1871
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,570
I'm good for it.

1872
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,770
I'm good for it.

1873
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:02,610
I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.

1874
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:05,490
It's just a little bit in the red.

1875
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:06,330
I'm good for it.

1876
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:07,090
They'll know.

1877
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:08,070
I can pay them back.

1878
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:10,730
What drink do you want?

1879
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:11,830
I'll take the orange.

1880
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:14,750
Of course, Kana.

1881
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,770
And then you can have the vintage.

1882
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:18,350
It's okay.

1883
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:20,470
It's just a little bit in the red, guys.

1884
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:22,270
It's just a little bit.

1885
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:25,150
They know I'm good for the money.

1886
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:27,990
And I don't need...

1887
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,010
Guys, I have two kidneys.

1888
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:31,630
That's all I'm saying.

1889
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,190
Guys, I have two.

1890
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:39,530
Let's see here.

1891
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:41,510
You had soy ramen.

1892
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:42,890
You had rice for lunch, didn't you?

1893
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:44,250
How did you know?

1894
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,770
Oh, no, I didn't.

1895
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:50,270
I actually did, but I'm just playing with her.

1896
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:55,910
Forget that.

1897
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:01,670
My vision wasn't fully accurate.

1898
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:04,110
Of course, you ate rice for lunch, didn't you?

1899
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,030
I mean, I did.

1900
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:09,550
But I feel like rice is cheating when it's used in some...

1901
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:11,550
Hey, shut the fuck up, Heito.

1902
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:15,310
We're supposed to agree with her.

1903
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,650
Thank you for the super chat.

1904
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,070
Thank you.

1905
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:18,590
Thank you.

1906
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:20,070
Debt is temporary.

1907
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:21,250
Kana is for...

1908
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:21,850
Exactly.

1909
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:25,950
Kana will be there for me forever, even if I'm broke.

1910
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:27,010
Right, Kana?

1911
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:32,130
She'll be with me even if I was poor.

1912
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:33,510
Right, guys?

1913
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:37,070
Joshua, Doki, Gohan.

1914
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:39,310
It's time to ask her for the diamond necklace back.

1915
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:40,790
Embed it on black.

1916
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:42,090
Thank you for the super chat.

1917
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:42,590
Thank you.

1918
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:43,210
Thank you.

1919
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:47,370
Most bento boxes have rice as a side for one.

1920
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:49,770
So your prediction isn't all that impressive.

1921
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:51,990
What are we even...

1922
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,790
Why am I so mean now?

1923
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:01,590
Well, I don't have anything I can call steel swords.

1924
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:03,610
So I thought I'd try something else.

1925
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:06,710
And the more impressive, the better, right?

1926
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:12,350
So I thought psychic readings would be so co...

1927
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:12,930
Oh, no.

1928
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:15,970
Is she an astrology girl?

1929
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:18,150
It's okay.

1930
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,430
Nobody's perfect, guys.

1931
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:21,350
Right.

1932
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:23,470
But you don't have any psychic powers, right?

1933
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:26,590
I mean, clearly you don't when you couldn't predict what I ate.

1934
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:28,570
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

1935
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:29,210
Thank you.

1936
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,010
Thank you.

1937
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:31,130
Two kidneys?

1938
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:31,970
You're right.

1939
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:35,250
Imagine how many super chats I can send with that.

1940
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,730
Thank you for the super chat.

1941
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:37,050
Thank you.

1942
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:37,390
Thank you.

1943
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:37,790
Thank you.

1944
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:41,630
Hey, I might be a later bloomer with my powers.

1945
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:47,290
Why don't you think about all this after those powers bloom then?

1946
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,230
Guys, nobody's perfect.

1947
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:59,530
But what would I do if someone asked if I have a party trick then?

1948
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:02,550
It's up to us to accept those flaws.

1949
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,330
Except for me, I'm perfect.

1950
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:11,170
Are you saying there isn't something you're super good at?

1951
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:15,890
Um, I mean...

1952
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:21,610
There's nothing I can think of where I'm better than the average person.

1953
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:26,790
I like acting and stuff, but I'm not that good.

1954
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:29,410
Guys, why don't we even play twisters?

1955
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:32,290
It's not because...

1956
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:33,470
Guys, I'm just...

1957
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:35,410
It's not because, like, this is what I'm looking for.

1958
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,050
But, like, I heard that there's something...

1959
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:39,450
There's twister and, like, you know, it's a fun game.

1960
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:46,630
Is there anything you notice when looking at me, Haito-kun?

1961
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:49,970
You know, potentials for a really cool skill?

1962
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:50,830
Guys, I'm...

1963
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,950
Guys, I just wanna win, okay?

1964
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:54,370
And I wanna win at twisters.

1965
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,750
That's really it.

1966
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,270
Let's see.

1967
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,690
Well, you're very good at making people smile.

1968
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:08,530
I'd call that a skill, Kana-chan.

1969
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:14,350
Every time I see you, I get all happy, you know?

1970
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:19,810
Kana-chan?

1971
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:22,570
I'm guessing that's not what you wanted to hear at all?

1972
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:37,390
No, that's exactly what I wanted to hear.

1973
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:38,210
I just...

1974
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:38,810
I...

1975
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:41,570
I don't know what to say back to something like that.

1976
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,030
What do I do, you, Haito-kun?

1977
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,630
You're always like this.

1978
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:59,330
You compliment me when I least expect.

1979
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:01,310
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

1980
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,510
Haha, sorry.

1981
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:05,490
I didn't say whatever is on my mind.

1982
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:09,050
I'll try to stop myself from saying stuff like that from now on.

1983
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:12,890
That's right.

1984
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:14,970
Always compliment the ladies.

1985
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:18,210
That's even worse.

1986
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:18,750
I...

1987
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,230
I'd love to hear you compliment me.

1988
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:30,270
I'll make sure to live up to your standards too.

1989
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:32,790
Like, I'll do my best to make you happy.

1990
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:35,010
She just wants to make me happy.

1991
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:36,570
It's not about the money.

1992
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:37,710
I fucking knew.

1993
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:38,570
I knew it, guys.

1994
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:42,390
You guys were telling me to stay away from Kana.

1995
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:44,210
That she is gonna take advantage.

1996
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:48,130
But she literally told me it's not about the money.

1997
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:49,970
She's here for me.

1998
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:53,130
You said that was my special skill, right?

1999
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:54,050
Mm-hmm.

2000
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,310
Oh...

2001
01:25:56,570 --> 01:26:00,550
It's been a while since I've been with you, Haito-kun.

2002
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:02,610
When I'm with you, Haito-kun...

2003
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,630
Time just flies by like that.

2004
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:07,850
Do you think you can...

2005
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:10,370
Of course I can, Kana.

2006
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:12,150
Time sure does fly by.

2007
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:16,090
What drink did you want?

2008
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:18,330
Okay, I'll take the cheap orange juice.

2009
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:19,710
And then...

2010
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,530
And then...

2011
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:23,190
You can get...

2012
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:23,750
You know what?

2013
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:26,010
I'm gonna splurge a little bit.

2014
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:27,610
Just for you, Kana.

2015
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,130
Just for you.

2016
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,760
I'm gonna get a...

2017
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,050
I'm gonna get like...

2018
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:37,830
I'm gonna get...

2019
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:38,590
Just for you.

2020
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,190
It's okay.

2021
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:40,250
It's just 10,000 yen.

2022
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:41,270
It's just...

2023
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:42,010
She's happy.

2024
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,710
It's all about making her happy.

2025
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:44,570
Thank you.

2026
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:45,610
I'll get you a bottle.

2027
01:26:46,590 --> 01:26:47,670
Oh my god.

2028
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:48,850
I told you it's all...

2029
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:50,070
Oh my god.

2030
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:51,050
I just...

2031
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:56,750
The more expensive you order, the lower the fucking thing.

2032
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:00,790
I just...

2033
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:02,590
I just noticed that the drink is so expensive.

2034
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:03,790
The cheap drinks are up...

2035
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:07,110
The cheap drinks are like here or something.

2036
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:10,050
But the expensive ones are like here.

2037
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:11,670
And then here.

2038
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:15,450
I just...

2039
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,770
It's like...

2040
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:23,110
That's how they get you.

2041
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:25,850
You can also zoom in?

2042
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:27,530
Okay, like...

2043
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:30,490
It's not that like I don't know how to.

2044
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:31,210
But like...

2045
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:31,790
Can you like...

2046
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:33,390
I feel like chat doesn't know.

2047
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:38,030
So why don't you tell chat like what button it is to zoom in for all the other gamers.

2048
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:39,650
I know what it is, guys.

2049
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:40,290
But...

2050
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:42,570
You...

2051
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:47,410
For all the other gamers in chat, you know.

2052
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:48,690
I bet they don't know too.

2053
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,270
Haido-kun, do you live by yourself?

2054
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:52,890
Yeah.

2055
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:53,890
And you?

2056
01:27:58,740 --> 01:27:59,220
Yep.

2057
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:01,220
Ever since I moved into the city.

2058
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,680
Well, to be honest, I guess I live in the family of two.

2059
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:14,180
That place is my chihuahua.

2060
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:15,700
Wawachin's house.

2061
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:17,100
Just as much as it is mine.

2062
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:18,960
That's true.

2063
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:19,660
That's true.

2064
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:20,860
Dogs are family.

2065
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:22,520
Gotcha.

2066
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:25,640
Well, at least you won't feel lonely whenever you go home.

2067
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,800
Especially with someone that loves you that much waiting for you.

2068
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:40,590
You're totally right!

2069
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:43,750
Wawa-chin really does boost my morale.

2070
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:48,770
He's the main reason why I could be my best ever since I moved here.

2071
01:28:55,450 --> 01:29:02,430
And because he makes me so happy, I need to do my part and make his life as great as it can be.

2072
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:08,010
A desire to make your dog have a wonderful life, huh?

2073
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,580
God, fuck.

2074
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,700
Okay, why are they so quiet?

2075
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,400
Why are they harder now?

2076
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:28,080
Okay, you know, I feel like you've already done that for him.

2077
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,960
Okay, this has to be the right answer.

2078
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:33,920
You know, I feel like you've already done that for him.

2079
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,040
I hope he sees it that way.

2080
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,900
I'll do my best to pamper him when I get home tonight too.

2081
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:45,540
I did it!

2082
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:46,440
Guys, I did it!

2083
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,000
I got the answer right!

2084
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,600
I might take him to dog park next time.

2085
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,340
I'm free.

2086
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,680
He loves running around outside after all.

2087
01:29:57,820 --> 01:30:01,580
Whenever you talk about Wawa-chin, your face really lights up.

2088
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,380
I can tell you cherish him deeply.

2089
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,500
Wawa-chin is my precious family.

2090
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:12,880
I'll introduce him to you too.

2091
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:16,060
Wawa-chin is family to me, so of course I love him.

2092
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,360
I'll introduce you to him if I get the chance one day.

2093
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:23,060
Guys, guys, that means she's gonna invite me to her house.

2094
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:28,260
How else would I... how else would I be introduced to the dog?

2095
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,680
I'm allowed to meet with your family?

2096
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,340
We're in, dragons.

2097
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,520
Putting it like that makes me feel a little nervous to be honest.

2098
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:40,040
It feels like I'm greeting your family before a wedding or something.

2099
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,340
That's just a joke but like, unless...

2100
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:53,020
He might bark at you saying, I won't let you take Kana-chan.

2101
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,740
When did it get so late?

2102
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:57,560
No, Haito, no!

2103
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:00,300
We still haven't done Twister!

2104
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:01,940
No!

2105
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:03,260
Oh my god!

2106
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:07,000
Okay guys, guys, don't worry.

2107
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,820
They know I'm good for it.

2108
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,060
Guys, do not worry.

2109
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,500
Now I'm more motivated to work harder.

2110
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:21,920
I'll be waiting for you so please come... of course Kana, thank you for today.

2111
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:27,510
I feel way better today.

2112
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:29,790
I'm ready to work hard now that I'm rested.

2113
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:30,670
See guys?

2114
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:34,270
I'm ready to work hard because I'm rested now.

2115
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:36,150
Alright, Saturday.

2116
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:38,190
Oh, I gotta borrow some money.

2117
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:39,830
No I don't, I just got paid.

2118
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:41,950
Yes, oh thank god.

2119
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:42,690
Okay, I'm okay.

2120
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:43,750
I'm okay.

2121
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:47,410
Today I'm gonna go buy... I'm gonna go buy...

2122
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:49,670
Okay, I'm gonna buy her some macarons.

2123
01:31:49,690 --> 01:31:51,530
She must like macarons, right?

2124
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:54,570
I'm gonna buy her some macarons.

2125
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:58,030
And then... and then...

2126
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:59,650
Wait, I can gift a vacation?

2127
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,710
You can give a vacation to a cast member who invited you.

2128
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:03,950
No!

2129
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:09,320
To a place to travel!

2130
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:13,760
Okay, Kana doesn't work on Saturday.

2131
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,940
So... so I just sleep.

2132
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:17,600
It's gamble time.

2133
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,240
Is it gamble time?

2134
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,240
No, no, no.

2135
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:20,500
No, Doki, do not gamble.

2136
01:32:20,780 --> 01:32:22,140
Just head to bed.

2137
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:23,200
Do not gamble.

2138
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:28,280
Just wait for Sunday so you can go talk to Kana.

2139
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,360
Now is my time to rest up and recover.

2140
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:36,120
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

2141
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,120
The job hub?

2142
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:40,260
But like... but...

2143
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,440
I wanna talk to Kana.

2144
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:45,320
I wanna talk to Kana.

2145
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:47,020
You came, I'm glad.

2146
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,940
Of course, Kana.

2147
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:49,020
Anything for you.

2148
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:51,580
Members, thank you for the super chat.

2149
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:52,340
Thank you, thank you.

2150
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:53,940
Your friends are waiting at your apartment.

2151
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,020
Doki, we need to talk.

2152
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,140
This hostess bar thing.

2153
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:56,960
It's killing you.

2154
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:00,540
We looked around and found a rehab with nice slot machines for you.

2155
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,460
Let's go there tomorrow, okay?

2156
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,340
Thank you for the super chat.

2157
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:05,240
Thank you, thank you.

2158
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,100
I'll just get going.

2159
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,740
I'll just get the Cassie's orange and then...

2160
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:12,560
Kana, I know you love the vintage Uma shoe.

2161
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,640
I know you love that.

2162
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:14,860
It tastes great.

2163
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:21,140
If you job hunt, you can make more money.

2164
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:22,880
Oh, it's cute.

2165
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:23,400
No!

2166
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,040
No,

2167
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,120
I missed out.

2168
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,340
I just noticed this shoe.

2169
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,300
Guys, I... guys...

2170
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:34,000
It's because I...

2171
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,400
I didn't miss out.

2172
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:40,640
Lucky macarons.

2173
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:40,980
Alright.

2174
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:42,480
You like macarons.

2175
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,180
Will you...

2176
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:46,420
Will you be willing to accept this?

2177
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,660
I hope you like it.

2178
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:48,900
She does!

2179
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,420
Guys, I have a feeling she just likes everything I give her.

2180
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,000
I'll take care of it.

2181
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,660
I've been really forgetful recently.

2182
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,960
I saved a shopping list on my phone the other day too.

2183
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:05,200
But I completely forgot that I even made it when I got to the store.

2184
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,320
I always forget things when I'm tired too.

2185
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:12,840
Santino, thank you for the super chat.

2186
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,480
Thank you, thank you.

2187
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,560
Use this for your next gambling session.

2188
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:17,100
Lord Kurose.

2189
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:22,760
This woman thinks we're wanting her when we really just want to pet the dog until it loves us more than her.

2190
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:24,200
Thank you for the super chat.

2191
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:24,880
Thank you, thank you.

2192
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,340
Look, I would agree with that.

2193
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,980
But she owns a chihuahua.

2194
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:28,620
And I...

2195
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:30,320
Look, it's not that I don't like chihuahuas.

2196
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:41,120
But all I'm saying is that I feel like out of all the dogs in the world, if there was one dog that I think is like, you know, the personification of the devil...

2197
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:48,320
If the devil was real, I think it would be the chihuahua.

2198
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:56,660
The other day, I was planning on only having one bowl of rice since I've been dining.

2199
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,820
But before I realized it, I've had three.

2200
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:05,020
I feel like that has nothing to do with forgetfulness.

2201
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,040
You just gave in to your cravings.

2202
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,860
Like, she's almost perfect.

2203
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:18,600
Except for the fact that she thinks she's psychic and also that she could be an astrology girl.

2204
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:21,260
And also, like, she owns a chihuahua.

2205
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:22,800
She's like, perfect.

2206
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:26,260
That's not true.

2207
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,300
I just forget about the whole rule I set myself when dieting.

2208
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:29,620
That's right.

2209
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,040
I'm going to give you a quick quiz to help you forget.

2210
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,380
Oh, why don't I give you a quiz?

2211
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:37,700
If you give me a quiz, I'll improve your memory.

2212
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,300
So that you won't forget as much.

2213
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,120
You know, using your brain leads to an increase in memorization.

2214
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:46,060
That's why I'm giving you a quiz.

2215
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:50,760
But what was I doing on the day off?

2216
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,200
What was I doing during my day off?

2217
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:55,720
Oh, right.

2218
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,080
We were talking about that, weren't we?

2219
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:57,800
That's right.

2220
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:58,780
You were saying...

2221
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:01,420
What was Kana doing on her day off?

2222
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,500
Combine words while remembering previous conversation.

2223
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:05,780
Women don't like...

2224
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:06,940
Exactly, guys!

2225
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:08,500
Women don't like it!

2226
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:12,840
She went for a walk at the park with her dog.

2227
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:13,600
There you go.

2228
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,660
She went for a walk at the park.

2229
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,820
Was it park?

2230
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:19,160
Guys, of course.

2231
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,480
Guys, I always remember, chat.

2232
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,680
At the park with...

2233
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,900
Was it the park, guys?

2234
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,040
I was too...

2235
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:33,260
Guys, I know.

2236
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,900
But I'm quizzing you guys.

2237
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,300
Do you guys remember?

2238
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,060
I knew the answer all along, chat.

2239
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,880
Guys, I knew the answer all along.

2240
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:43,040
I just wanted to know if you guys were listening.

2241
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,040
Of course, I remember.

2242
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,680
I'm a woman.

2243
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:48,240
I remember everything.

2244
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,040
I like you.

2245
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:57,300
Bingo!

2246
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,160
You really were listening to what I told you.

2247
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:01,480
I like how you're so attentive.

2248
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:02,140
I know.

2249
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,840
Of course, Kana.

2250
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,860
Of course, I remember everything you say.

2251
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:15,570
I need to be careful about being forgetful too.

2252
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:17,950
Or else I'll never be able to go through a dieting.

2253
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:24,450
I keep saying that has nothing to do with memorization.

2254
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:27,630
I think it's your willpower that you need to work on.

2255
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:28,650
I don't know!

2256
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:31,290
This is not how you get the ladies!

2257
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:35,510
You never criticize them, especially about dieting!

2258
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:41,350
Kana is just like, let me ignore that because I want you to spend more money.

2259
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:43,670
Kaito-kun, should I get you more drinks?

2260
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:46,610
I can keep going but only continue if you want to.

2261
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:47,770
Yes.

2262
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,450
I have the money this time.

2263
01:37:52,570 --> 01:37:53,190
Thank you.

2264
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,070
I thought you were going to...

2265
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:55,030
Of course, I will never go home.

2266
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:56,350
I'll max it out for you.

2267
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:57,470
What drink?

2268
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:58,030
I'll just...

2269
01:37:58,030 --> 01:37:59,130
Let me keep...

2270
01:37:59,130 --> 01:37:59,410
You know what?

2271
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:00,730
I feel a little adventurous.

2272
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:02,050
I feel...

2273
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:04,610
I feel so adventurous right now.

2274
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:05,930
I'll spend 100 yen more.

2275
01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:09,210
And then for you, my queen.

2276
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:10,130
I'm going to...

2277
01:38:10,130 --> 01:38:10,670
You know what?

2278
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:11,210
I'm going to...

2279
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:13,870
I'm going to give you the fine wine.

2280
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:20,750
Yep, yep.

2281
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:21,570
It tastes great.

2282
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:22,170
Any...

2283
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:22,870
Yep, yep.

2284
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:23,450
It tastes great.

2285
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:23,990
Wait.

2286
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:24,150
Wait.

2287
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:24,830
It just...

2288
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:25,730
It just tastes great?

2289
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:28,310
Is just...

2290
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:29,870
It's just great?

2291
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:32,070
Wait...

2292
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:34,250
No, I pressed q instead of E!

2293
01:38:40,210 --> 01:38:41,470
I keep forget...

2294
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:41,890
I keep...

2295
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:43,570
I don't know how to read.

2296
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:46,770
I thought zoom.

2297
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:49,210
I didn't see it zoom out.

2298
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:51,910
I...

2299
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:58,890
Q was zoom out, E was zoom in, but I didn't read it fully.

2300
01:38:59,050 --> 01:39:00,110
I just saw zoom.

2301
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:25,190
I had become a kid and I was enjoying my summer vacation.

2302
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:29,750
You know, catching bugs and swimming in the river.

2303
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:34,090
Kind of like when I went to my grandma's place to spend the summer.

2304
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:43,770
Wait, who did the throw up emote?

2305
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:44,750
Oh la...

2306
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:46,550
You don't understand!

2307
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:48,970
This is why you don't have Kana.

2308
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:51,530
Wait, what about this?

2309
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:52,690
That is a nightmare.

2310
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:55,090
I mean, that sounds pretty fun to me.

2311
01:39:56,170 --> 01:39:56,710
Right?

2312
01:39:56,770 --> 01:39:58,630
I thought so too in the beginning.

2313
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:03,490
But then the moment said, I wish my summer vacation would go on forever.

2314
01:40:04,010 --> 01:40:07,030
And that forever didn't include you.

2315
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:08,190
Boom!

2316
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:17,650
Oh wait, a giant version of my boss crawled out of the soil and said, I'll give you a vacation for the rest of your life!

2317
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:18,850
You're fired!

2318
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:25,330
I feel like someone pregnant emoji.

2319
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:30,010
Right, anyone would wake up screaming after that.

2320
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:34,310
I thought I had overcome this by now.

2321
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:37,470
But I guess me getting fired really got me emotionally.

2322
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:43,650
You're not to blame though.

2323
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:49,230
I mean, sure, you were genuinely shocked.

2324
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:51,490
It takes time for emotional wounds to heal.

2325
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:52,650
You're so right, Kana.

2326
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:54,490
Free thank yous, super chat.

2327
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:55,290
Thank you, thank you.

2328
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:57,030
Bunny girls, I enjoyed your company, sir.

2329
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:58,490
Credit card declines.

2330
01:40:58,490 --> 01:41:02,090
Bunny girls, low tier god lighting appears around them.

2331
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:03,270
You should...

2332
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,850
I know that, but I just want to forget it.

2333
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:18,550
How about this?

2334
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:21,610
I'll make you forget those bad memories!

2335
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:21,890
Freeze!

2336
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:26,510
Are you saying you're going to cheer me up somehow?

2337
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:29,590
You really are kind to the core, Hana.

2338
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:36,270
A special drink?

2339
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:39,870
It'll only cost you like the rest of your money.

2340
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:43,330
I think there's a special drink we hid away in the shop storage.

2341
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:47,790
I'm sure if you take a sip, your memory will fade away in an instant.

2342
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:50,930
I prefer not to forget...

2343
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:52,210
With something like that.

2344
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:59,890
Of course, I just need more time with you so you'll get me the special drink, right?

2345
01:42:00,170 --> 01:42:01,030
Right, Hakana?

2346
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:02,150
Is that it?

2347
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:11,490
I'll take the orange juice.

2348
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:14,050
Of course, of course.

2349
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:15,250
And you can get the...

2350
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:18,150
the vintage umashi because I know that's what you love.

2351
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:20,990
Yup, yup, it tastes great!

2352
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:25,050
No, I keep... guys, I need to buy new drinks!

2353
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:27,430
She's already too used to the umashi!

2354
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,320
We're looking respectfully.

2355
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:43,680
Conversation.

2356
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:47,220
What if like I buy food this time?

2357
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,680
Well, buying food like increases...

2358
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:50,240
Okay.

2359
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:53,180
Why... do you want to share a pizza with me?

2360
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:55,800
With me, Kanna?

2361
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,900
We can share a pizza together.

2362
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,260
Oh, this is great!

2363
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:02,960
I love this!

2364
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:14,930
There's so much going on today that I want...

2365
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:15,710
Oh my god, you're right!

2366
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:16,490
I should've gotten sushi!

2367
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:17,370
It's our favorite!

2368
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:18,970
You're so right!

2369
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:22,090
Oh my god, this is why this is a group effort.

2370
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:28,370
If all of us work together, if all the dragoons work together, we surely might score one Kanna.

2371
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:32,310
You took your day off to sing and here I am complaining!

2372
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:34,830
Don't worry about it.

2373
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:36,110
You should relax when you get home.

2374
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:39,110
It's not good to pile up your fatigue and leave it be.

2375
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,860
Yeah, good plan.

2376
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,000
Thanks, Haito-kun.

2377
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,780
It's like we're all at the same bar.

2378
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,120
Exactly!

2379
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:53,760
You're like my wingman!

2380
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,960
You're all behind me, wingmanning me.

2381
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:59,080
Do you have some sort of method to get rid of fatigue?

2382
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,560
Something easy would be great, if possible.

2383
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,080
Not the naps.

2384
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:04,340
Naps never work.

2385
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,120
Okay, never... not the naps.

2386
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:13,200
We learned that napping does not help at all.

2387
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:15,640
How about eating something sweet?

2388
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:17,040
How about getting a massage?

2389
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:19,400
A massage... okay.

2390
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:20,300
A massage.

2391
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,220
I'm gonna say a massage.

2392
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:23,760
How about getting a massage?

2393
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:25,320
Not by me, of course.

2394
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,420
But like, if you insist.

2395
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:33,720
Oh, a massage?

2396
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:34,660
That would be great!

2397
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,260
Maybe I should buy a massage device.

2398
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,240
I hope there's something that's easy to use at home.

2399
01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:45,590
She liked that answer, guys.

2400
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:46,130
We did it.

2401
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:46,730
We're so in.

2402
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:52,010
Oh, and you can't forget taking a nice warm bath, too.

2403
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:55,850
Just sitting there in the warm water as your pain slowly fades away.

2404
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:57,770
Right.

2405
01:44:57,990 --> 01:45:00,130
Oh, you know, we could, you know...

2406
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:02,710
We can go to the hot springs.

2407
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:04,470
Wow!

2408
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:08,810
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2409
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:10,610
I'm talking about the hot springs!

2410
01:45:12,670 --> 01:45:14,390
They just imagined me in a bathtub?

2411
01:45:14,650 --> 01:45:16,150
That's some forbidden territory.

2412
01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:16,690
You can't...

2413
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:17,190
Wow!

2414
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:19,230
Bro, what the fuck?

2415
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:21,230
Am I getting called out for my imagination?

2416
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:22,930
That didn't totally happen?

2417
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:24,670
Like, you don't know that.

2418
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:28,370
What do you mean, me?

2419
01:45:30,210 --> 01:45:32,930
She doesn't know what I was thinking about!

2420
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:38,070
You were the one that brought it up.

2421
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,600
Let's change the topic, then.

2422
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,240
Where do you wash first when you're in the bath?

2423
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:48,760
My hair.

2424
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:50,460
What?

2425
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:51,000
What?

2426
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:52,360
What hair?

2427
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:54,440
Do you not wash your hair first?

2428
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,580
That's where the water touches first!

2429
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,000
How is that bad?

2430
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,140
Because I'm...

2431
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:03,160
I'm the one that suddenly...

2432
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,220
I'm the one that shoves my clothes into the bathtub.

2433
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,940
Wait, forget I even asked that.

2434
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:11,620
The you and my mind has started to stri...

2435
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:12,780
Wha...!

2436
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:16,500
Wow!

2437
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:19,760
Next scene.

2438
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,560
Bro, she, she...

2439
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:23,460
She's going further than I want to...

2440
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:26,100
I was just thinking about the hair on my head!

2441
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:27,220
What?

2442
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:27,720
What?

2443
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,020
Oh my god!

2444
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:31,680
We're living rent-free!

2445
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:33,180
We're so in!

2446
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,860
Nexi, we know what you're thinking about.

2447
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,100
What was I thinking about?!

2448
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,500
Thank you for the super chat!

2449
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,620
Thank you, thank you!

2450
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,560
I can't have that happen in my head, Haito-kun!

2451
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:49,640
Don't blame me!

2452
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:52,260
You're the one who's imagining the whole scenario!

2453
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:54,340
Does this mean we get to play Twister now?

2454
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:58,260
Is it already this late?

2455
01:46:58,360 --> 01:46:59,160
I'll head back.

2456
01:46:59,240 --> 01:46:59,380
No!

2457
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:00,660
Haito!

2458
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:02,820
We were so in!

2459
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:09,800
You don't leave when you're like literally there!

2460
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:13,440
You're so fucking stupid, Haito!

2461
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:18,320
Oh my god!

2462
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:21,360
You don't just leave when you're literally there!

2463
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:24,320
I'm waiting for you!

2464
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,460
I'll be waiting for you, so please come again!

2465
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:28,620
Yes!

2466
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:29,560
Thank you for today!

2467
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:32,780
Yay!

2468
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,900
We had a good, fun conversation!

2469
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,500
Alright, we're trying to get a better job, right?

2470
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:43,400
Alright, I made 57.

2471
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,120
Alright, is it job hunting time?

2472
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,620
Can I actually get a better job, chat?

2473
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:48,620
Oh, Haito!

2474
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,300
The fumble is so fucking crazy!

2475
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,820
I didn't know!

2476
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:57,340
Do I actually get a better job, chat?

2477
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:58,240
Yes?

2478
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:58,620
Okay.

2479
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:02,260
By applying on the dispatch recruitment day, you can earn money.

2480
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:04,340
One dispatch consumes 2k.

2481
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,240
Be careful not to overwork.

2482
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:09,540
Alright, do you want to spend two days on dispatch?

2483
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:11,220
Yes.

2484
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:12,860
Let's do it.

2485
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:13,920
I'm working.

2486
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,040
71,000 yen!

2487
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:17,900
Oh my god!

2488
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:22,320
This is so much... Thank you for your hard work!

2489
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,980
Oh my god!

2490
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,360
No!

2491
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,100
No!

2492
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,380
I missed a week!

2493
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:29,700
I missed a...

2494
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:31,660
No!

2495
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,340
Kana, please don't forget me!

2496
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:34,820
Kana!

2497
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:40,640
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna buy her some perfumes.

2498
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:45,780
And I'm gonna buy her... I'm gonna buy her... um... pajamas.

2499
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:49,460
And then... and then I'm gonna buy her roses.

2500
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,220
Okay, I have gifts for all three days.

2501
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,760
Okay, we made it.

2502
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:54,940
Okay, I missed... Okay, it's okay.

2503
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:55,920
Saturday...

2504
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,500
She's not there on Saturday.

2505
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,900
So we're gonna go gambling.

2506
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:02,460
No, do you think she forgot about... me?

2507
01:49:02,980 --> 01:49:03,460
Guys?

2508
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,120
Wait, do you think... No, it's still not open!

2509
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:09,640
Okay, okay, okay.

2510
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:11,140
We're gonna... we're gonna gamble.

2511
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:12,260
Guys, guys.

2512
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,440
No, we don't need a save, guys.

2513
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,120
We're not save scumming!

2514
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,500
Chat?

2515
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,100
We're not save scumming!

2516
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,060
Guys, this is it.

2517
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:22,840
This is it.

2518
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:26,280
We must... we... we're so lucky right now.

2519
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:27,980
We have so much money right now.

2520
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:28,580
Chat?

2521
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:29,620
This is it.

2522
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,040
No, we're not gonna save.

2523
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:35,200
Guys, we don't need a save cause we're gonna earn... go up.

2524
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:35,760
Yes!

2525
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,020
Okay, that's good.

2526
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:39,400
I'll take that 2,000 yen.

2527
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,020
We need to cash out.

2528
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,560
I... I'm... I'm scared.

2529
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:50,300
I'm too scared to keep going.

2530
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:57,380
Bro, she's... she takes a break on Saturday.

2531
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:58,800
What the fuck's the point?

2532
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:00,900
Okay, we're gonna... we're gonna sleep in.

2533
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:02,380
And see her on Sunday.

2534
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:04,800
Alright, that was a bit scary.

2535
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:05,740
Yeah, we're gonna sleep in.

2536
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,000
She's gonna be there on Sunday.

2537
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:09,400
I'll always show up on Sunday.

2538
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:11,300
No, we don't need a save, guys!

2539
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:13,020
We don't need a save!

2540
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,800
I shaved, brushed my teeth, and got the wrinkles out of my clothes.

2541
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:17,840
Okay, I'm good.

2542
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:18,920
Let's go into the shop.

2543
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:20,580
Chat?

2544
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:22,160
Kana, I'm back!

2545
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,260
Did you... do you remember me, Kana?

2546
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:27,860
Of course!

2547
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:29,160
Of course, Kana!

2548
01:50:31,140 --> 01:50:33,160
Don't worry, I'm gonna...

2549
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:35,820
Kana, Kana, today is big money day.

2550
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:37,320
Today...

2551
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:39,500
It's...

2552
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:42,420
Big... Okay, maybe not that big.

2553
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,960
Maybe... maybe not that big money.

2554
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,080
I just realized it's a hundred and...

2555
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,120
Well, we'll go with the lamp pair.

2556
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,660
It's... it's second big money day.

2557
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,500
It's almost big money day.

2558
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:04,180
Today is I.O.

2559
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,100
money day.

2560
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,320
I'm not ready yet.

2561
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:06,640
I'm...

2562
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:09,360
Of course!

2563
01:51:10,850 --> 01:51:11,680
I'm ready, guys.

2564
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:13,560
I'm ready.

2565
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:17,760
Oh, it's all the way down there.

2566
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:24,340
Kana, Kana, I...

2567
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,340
Kana, I got you... I got you perfume, Kana.

2568
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:31,100
Hanover...

2569
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:35,440
Will you be willing to accept this, Kana?

2570
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:38,200
Ah!

2571
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,480
She likes it!

2572
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:41,420
I'll take care of it.

2573
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:41,940
Of course!

2574
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:42,900
Of course, Kana!

2575
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,720
Is your blood type O?

2576
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,040
But... Oh yeah, there's like... in Asia culture, it's like...

2577
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,780
A blood type is like a personality trait.

2578
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:51,780
Actually, it is.

2579
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:52,480
How did you know?

2580
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:59,380
Well, you have a carefree vibe about you.

2581
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:00,960
I know, especially with money, right?

2582
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:06,520
So you based it off of a blood type personality test?

2583
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:09,140
I don't know how accurate something like that is.

2584
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:18,120
Well, whether you believe it or not isn't important.

2585
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:19,760
What's important is that I can believe it.

2586
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:20,660
I can lead the conversation.

2587
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:23,080
Well, let's see.

2588
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,460
Would your blood type be...

2589
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,680
Guys, okay, I actually don't like... care about the blood type personality...

2590
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:29,640
Holy shit!

2591
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:30,820
So...

2592
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,120
I see that like astrology.

2593
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:36,520
Let's see.

2594
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,380
Thank you for the super chat.

2595
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:38,200
Thank you, thank you.

2596
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:43,000
All this and you're somehow less of a simp than you are while playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

2597
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:44,780
Thank you for the super chat.

2598
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:45,960
Thank you, thank you.

2599
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,860
Guys, what is a good blood type?

2600
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:50,940
What is a good one?

2601
01:52:54,740 --> 01:52:57,300
Is it A, B, A, B?

2602
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,460
I don't know what the blood types are!

2603
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,260
A, B is supposed to be the ganky one.

2604
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:05,740
We use them... A, B is normal.

2605
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:08,280
So, B is more common.

2606
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,680
A, B is the universal recipient.

2607
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:16,940
A, B is good because it's a universal recipient, guys.

2608
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:18,740
A, B is superior.

2609
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,320
A is for kind people.

2610
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:22,780
A, B is two-faced.

2611
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:27,080
Always... guys, I feel like a lot of you guys don't even know as well.

2612
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:27,620
Okay.

2613
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:29,580
A or B?

2614
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:30,260
I'm gonna go with A.

2615
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:35,060
I'm gonna go with A because A is always a good blood type, right?

2616
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,560
A perhaps?

2617
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:37,920
Yes!

2618
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:43,940
Are you suggesting I'm metathorical person, serious and sincere too?

2619
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:44,880
I knew it!

2620
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:46,300
I knew it!

2621
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,720
My Asian genes spoke to me.

2622
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:50,800
Because A is always better than B.

2623
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,720
Serious and sincere too?

2624
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,740
You know me too well.

2625
01:53:56,940 --> 01:53:57,920
We're so in.

2626
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,160
The correct answer was O type.

2627
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:00,760
The same...

2628
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:01,200
Okay!

2629
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:03,660
I didn't even get that as a choice!

2630
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:06,520
I don't care too much about the details.

2631
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,360
And I'm pretty easygoing, wouldn't you say?

2632
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:15,480
Well, when you put it that way, I suppose I see that inside of you.

2633
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:18,700
But if I said you were a metathorical or emotional person, I wouldn't be able to tell you.

2634
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:20,660
For example, you feel that way too, right?

2635
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,140
I guess you're right.

2636
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:29,580
Sorry.

2637
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,640
I thought it could be...

2638
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:31,540
Oh my gosh!

2639
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:33,420
Why am I so bad at this?

2640
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,400
Why is Haito always...

2641
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,700
Haito, I worked so hard trying to get you Kana.

2642
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:40,020
But you always f**k it up, Haito.

2643
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:41,560
Why do you do this to me?

2644
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:45,540
I spent so much of our money for her.

2645
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,900
No, I should be the one apologizing.

2646
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:53,700
You went through all that trouble thinking up of someone to talk about.

2647
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:57,040
Right, what blood type are your parents?

2648
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:00,580
My dad is A.

2649
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,100
And my mom is B.

2650
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:07,200
But I don't know why you're bringing this up where their personalities are nothing like their readings.

2651
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:08,940
I don't know!

2652
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:15,080
I even bought her the second most expensive wine!

2653
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:18,140
Sorry.

2654
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:20,660
I can't even control this!

2655
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,220
Bro, I can't control incompetence!

2656
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:32,880
I'll do my best not to ruin the vibes like that again.

2657
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,300
Gambit, thank you for the super chat.

2658
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:36,040
Thank you, thank you.

2659
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,820
Blood type tomato juice.

2660
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,200
Self sabotage.

2661
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,940
I just want to tease you a little in return.

2662
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:43,660
That's all.

2663
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:44,620
Whoopsie.

2664
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,200
Of course.

2665
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:48,900
Of course, Kana.

2666
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,260
Let's get more twinks.

2667
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:52,880
Alright.

2668
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,940
I'll drink the Cassie's orange.

2669
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:57,160
And then you go.

2670
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:00,500
Okay, look, I already gave you like the second most expensive so we're gonna...

2671
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,480
We're just gonna go back to the usual.

2672
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:04,740
Well, why don't we try...

2673
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:06,860
Why don't we try bunny trap?

2674
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:08,880
We can afford a little splurge.

2675
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:10,540
Yep, yep.

2676
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:11,580
It tastes great!

2677
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:14,180
Alright.

2678
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:17,560
We'll look at the most respectable part of the body.

2679
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:18,720
The hair.

2680
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:25,060
Uh, I can't gift any more presents today?

2681
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,440
Oh, don't worry.

2682
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:27,200
We can buy sushi.

2683
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,800
We can buy sushi because I know how much you love sushi and I have the extra money right now.

2684
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:33,860
Yep, yep.

2685
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,720
It tastes great.

2686
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:36,860
Kana, didn't you say that... Okay, Kana.

2687
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:37,460
You're perfect.

2688
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:38,580
Ice cream.

2689
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:39,400
Cake.

2690
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:40,440
Nah.

2691
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,080
Mochi is an option too.

2692
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,000
Hmm.

2693
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:47,240
Damn you, Doki.

2694
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:47,900
Hahaha.

2695
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:51,220
Are you thinking about what to have for dessert when you get home?

2696
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:56,720
She's always hungry.

2697
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:59,800
How did you know?

2698
01:57:00,040 --> 01:57:02,760
That looked like I was that hungry for some sugary treats?

2699
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:08,300
I mean, you were the one mothering about it though.

2700
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,380
I guess you didn't realize that you said that.

2701
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:19,440
I want to eat all three to be honest.

2702
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:19,540
I'm hungry.

2703
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:20,080
Ice cream.

2704
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:20,500
Cake.

2705
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:21,400
Mochi.

2706
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:23,060
They're all amazing.

2707
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,940
I know I can destroy all three in a heartbeat.

2708
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:26,940
But...

2709
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:35,580
But if I do something so extreme at night, I'll regret it.

2710
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:39,960
I did something so extreme at night, I know I'll wake up in the middle of the night with nothing but regret for my actions.

2711
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:44,620
Well, eating too much is never good for your body either.

2712
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,620
You should probably just choose the one.

2713
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:51,780
Guys, what do you think she likes the most, guys?

2714
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,080
Did she ever tell me what she likes?

2715
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:56,440
She never told me what dessert she likes the most!

2716
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:58,900
How am I... Okay, what's the best dessert?

2717
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:00,520
How about cake?

2718
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:01,720
Hahaha.

2719
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:04,720
Mochi, cake, ice cream.

2720
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:05,200
Okay.

2721
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:06,440
Cake.

2722
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,740
It has to be cake, right?

2723
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,200
Cake... cake is... is universally loved.

2724
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:13,900
There's so many different flavors with cake.

2725
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:15,400
Chocolate cake.

2726
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:20,140
I actually bought some chocolate cake last night, so I need to eat it while it's fresh.

2727
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:21,360
Yeah, that's def...

2728
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,380
I did it!

2729
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:22,860
I knew it!

2730
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:25,500
I made the right choice without any help whatsoever.

2731
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:31,880
Maybe I should just eat it all.

2732
01:58:32,020 --> 01:58:33,100
I can't decide.

2733
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:34,920
I love them all equally.

2734
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:44,440
Nice guess, Doki.

2735
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:46,960
Hahaha.

2736
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,220
It's not a guess.

2737
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:51,380
I know the way to Kana's heart and not you.

2738
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:53,980
And they're made to be enjoyed after all.

2739
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:58,200
I think it's my civil duty to enjoy them all to their fullest.

2740
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:04,600
Yup, that's my civil duty!

2741
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:10,860
Oh my gosh, that was a very long sentence she said for, yup, that's my civil duty.

2742
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:15,460
I'm worried you're gonna have an upset stomach by the end of this.

2743
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:18,580
I'm gonna have to drink some more.

2744
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:19,640
You can keep drinking, Haito-kun.

2745
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,120
Don't... of course I can.

2746
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:23,260
Anything for you.

2747
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:25,520
I'll stay here forever.

2748
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:27,700
Of course.

2749
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:32,740
I'll take my... I'm gonna be a little adventurous, guys, and I think I'm gonna get some beer.

2750
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:36,500
I'll be... I'll spend... I'll spend like a hundred yen more.

2751
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:37,300
Hahaha.

2752
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,300
It's just a hundred yen more.

2753
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:43,160
Hahaha.

2754
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:43,280
Hahaha.

2755
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:49,660
Woop.

2756
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,140
Woop.

2757
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:50,720
Woop.

2758
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,660
Looking at her hair.

2759
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:52,460
Hahaha.

2760
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:55,820
Alright, conversation time.

2761
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:06,160
Alright, so what do you have, uh, when you, so what do you do when you have spare time at home?

2762
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:07,380
I play with Chihuahua's mom.

2763
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:12,560
Even though we've been playing since the day before, I've been playing since night.

2764
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:18,880
I always play with Wawa-Chan, my chihuahua.

2765
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,280
I'll start to play with him and by the time I realize, it ends up being the dead of night.

2766
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:28,660
If anything, maybe Wawa-Chan is looking after you.

2767
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:34,760
What do you do at home, Haito-kun?

2768
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:37,260
Well, video games for one.

2769
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:38,960
I'll play on console.

2770
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:48,420
I'll play on a... Oh my gosh, I have hit rock bottom.

2771
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:50,540
I'll play on a console I have at home.

2772
02:00:50,700 --> 02:00:52,120
Then play a little bit on my phone.

2773
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,540
Oh no, I'm also a gacha gamer.

2774
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:54,700
Before I sleep.

2775
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:56,860
Where's my PC?

2776
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:58,860
I have a PC!

2777
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:01,000
What happened to Steam?

2778
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:03,040
I'm literally playing this on Steam!

2779
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:06,480
Games... Kana?

2780
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:09,820
You not like video games, Kana?

2781
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:13,880
After I spent like... I'm pretty sure I spent like...

2782
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:16,820
Like more than 5k on here.

2783
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:19,080
Like American 5000 dollars.

2784
02:01:19,300 --> 02:01:21,800
And now you're gonna tell me games, huh?

2785
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,520
Oh, do you dislike video games, Kana?

2786
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:26,320
Please answer wisely, Kana.

2787
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:28,680
Oh!

2788
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:29,240
Oh!

2789
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,780
Oh, thank god!

2790
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,820
I was gonna say that was my deal breaker.

2791
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:36,000
It would've been over.

2792
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:39,220
Console is cool too.

2793
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:41,260
Yes, but not just console!

2794
02:01:41,580 --> 02:01:44,300
I need to expand your horizons!

2795
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:47,000
You need to expand them!

2796
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,400
There's also PC gaming!

2797
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:50,880
Hahaha!

2798
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,300
Nope, I love them actually.

2799
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:57,120
But that's exactly why I made myself stop playing.

2800
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:02,100
And I end up being really loud, you see.

2801
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:06,920
Oh, is it because of... Don't worry, my apartment has soundproof so if you, you know...

2802
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:09,220
Wait, no, that's not what I mean!

2803
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:10,060
For gaming!

2804
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,180
For gaming!

2805
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:14,220
So neighbors won't complain for gaming!

2806
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:15,640
What the hell are you doing?

2807
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:16,900
You haven't lost yet!

2808
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:18,020
No!

2809
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:25,060
I won't... I'll say things like, I'll get you or damn you!

2810
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,540
I won't... Oh my god, she's toxic!

2811
02:02:26,580 --> 02:02:27,200
She's perfect!

2812
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:28,900
You know, the usual.

2813
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:32,880
I'm trying to hold back, but I'm always out of it.

2814
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,260
Am I trying to hold back?

2815
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:39,340
I'll be back to shutting by the time I realize it.

2816
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:42,080
That's why I love you, but I'm sealing you.

2817
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:43,680
So...

2818
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:47,700
That's why I forced myself to shut you out.

2819
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:48,460
I'm trying to stop playing.

2820
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:51,940
I don't want to cause any disturbances to my neighbors, you know?

2821
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:52,920
That's what I heard.

2822
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:57,060
I heard in Japan it's really hard to get like a place that was soundproofing for streamers.

2823
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:00,500
Because like, you know, especially like streamers are like really loud and stuff.

2824
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:03,700
Like you can get like called on by the police and stuff very easily.

2825
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:07,020
That's a bit of a shame.

2826
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:08,800
I never knew you were so passionate.

2827
02:03:08,860 --> 02:03:10,120
Oh my god, thank god she's perfect.

2828
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:12,220
I thought she was gonna judge me for my gaming.

2829
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:14,660
I was ready to go to another girl.

2830
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:17,000
I was so fucking ready to be like, bye.

2831
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:23,820
Don't you play puzzle games instead of something that's so action focused?

2832
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:25,640
You know, something that uses your...

2833
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:27,220
Haito, what the fuck?

2834
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:29,860
Why would you suggest puzzle games?

2835
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,660
Oh my god.

2836
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:32,520
Haito does not represent me.

2837
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,220
I would have walked away.

2838
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:43,360
It's all the same.

2839
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:46,400
I end up being overly passionate even if I'm solving a puzzle.

2840
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:49,180
Thank you for the super chat.

2841
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:49,620
Thank you.

2842
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:50,080
Thank you.

2843
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:52,140
Kana says gamer words.

2844
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:57,700
I'll be loud from being so hyper after beating a tough puzzle.

2845
02:03:57,820 --> 02:04:01,040
And similarly, I'll be loud if I can beat a harder puzzle.

2846
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:06,060
In a way, I'm jealous of how passionate you are towards video games.

2847
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:12,920
Oh my god.

2848
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,540
I'll buy you one right now.

2849
02:04:14,740 --> 02:04:16,980
Who cares if I need the loan money, Kana?

2850
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:21,960
If I ever become rich, I'll buy a soundproof room.

2851
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:24,320
And then I'll play video games to my heart's content.

2852
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:26,100
So I'll be patient for now.

2853
02:04:35,810 --> 02:04:37,910
Do you want something to take with you?

2854
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,410
You know, maybe something that symbolizes our friendship?

2855
02:04:42,230 --> 02:04:43,990
I have something perfect.

2856
02:04:46,210 --> 02:04:46,730
Yes?

2857
02:04:47,810 --> 02:04:48,290
Yes?

2858
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,930
Yes, Kana?

2859
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:50,270
Oh!

2860
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:53,690
Okay.

2861
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:54,950
It's time.

2862
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:00,700
Oh my god.

2863
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:04,120
Cast members may invite you to play mini games.

2864
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:05,620
You can pay a fee?

2865
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:06,180
Okay.

2866
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:07,080
Alright.

2867
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:09,180
And enjoy.

2868
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:12,160
She's like, can I invite you after hours?

2869
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:14,400
By the way, it'll be 100,000 yen.

2870
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:15,860
Like...

2871
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:17,700
Oh!

2872
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:18,500
A pony!

2873
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:18,980
Yes!

2874
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:19,560
Yes!

2875
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:22,200
Of course!

2876
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:23,480
Oh my god!

2877
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:26,020
I'm gonna get a Polaroid photo!

2878
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:30,100
This is not Twister.

2879
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:37,320
You select the pose and take a photo.

2880
02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:39,420
You can check the photos you took from your home.

2881
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:43,500
As your likability increases, the number of poses increases as well.

2882
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,040
Okay.

2883
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:50,600
What the fuck does chicken...

2884
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:56,880
Guys, I think I know what chicken meat means.

2885
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:15,300
Let's see.

2886
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,800
I don't know.

2887
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,620
I'm trying to figure out the best one.

2888
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,200
Okay.

2889
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:19,440
No.

2890
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:20,360
This one, her hands.

2891
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:21,720
I don't like where her hands...

2892
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:22,380
I don't like...

2893
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:24,260
Like... where...

2894
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:25,280
I don't...

2895
02:06:26,080 --> 02:06:27,460
I don't like where her hands are.

2896
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:27,980
Alright.

2897
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:28,780
Maybe...

2898
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:29,660
Bunny ears?

2899
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:30,940
Bunny ears, right?

2900
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,080
I don't know, guys.

2901
02:06:39,980 --> 02:06:40,460
Or...

2902
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:41,920
But...

2903
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:46,040
I'm trying to decide!

2904
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:47,220
It's so difficult!

2905
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:51,020
What the fuck is chicken...

2906
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:52,760
You know what the fuck chicken meat is.

2907
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:53,580
You know...

2908
02:06:53,580 --> 02:06:54,380
You know...

2909
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:58,660
Don't act ignorant to me about chicken meat.

2910
02:06:58,780 --> 02:06:59,360
Okay.

2911
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:00,690
Maybe we'll do...

2912
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:02,300
We'll do...

2913
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:03,900
You know what?

2914
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:04,440
Okay.

2915
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:04,900
Let's see.

2916
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,020
Wait.

2917
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:10,180
Guys, we're here for the eyes, right?

2918
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,520
We're here for the eyes.

2919
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:19,040
Oh, what about like...

2920
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:20,760
Okay.

2921
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:21,220
Ooh.

2922
02:07:21,220 --> 02:07:23,640
Look at that beautiful hand.

2923
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:27,880
Okay.

2924
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:30,740
What about the hands, though?

2925
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:31,540
Guys!

2926
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,600
What about the hands?

2927
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:35,780
Oh, what?

2928
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:36,220
No!

2929
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:37,260
I didn't mean to!

2930
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:38,220
No!

2931
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:40,840
There's a time limit!

2932
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:46,880
This is nice.

2933
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:54,720
I didn't know that!

2934
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:00,240
I'm glad you came again, Kana.

2935
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:01,540
Oh, my.

2936
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:03,600
Tell us, Doki, what does this mean?

2937
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:05,080
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

2938
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:05,560
Thank you.

2939
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:06,240
Thank you.

2940
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:08,640
Oh, my God!

2941
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:10,660
I thought I could...

2942
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:11,240
I...

2943
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:20,610
I hope you have beautiful hands, Kana.

2944
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:25,490
Guys!

2945
02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:25,710
Guys!

2946
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:27,490
This is all I wanted!

2947
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:31,130
Phew.

2948
02:08:31,130 --> 02:08:32,710
It was fun, wasn't it?

2949
02:08:32,770 --> 02:08:34,650
I was sweating a little.

2950
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:37,050
Oh, could they give us super chat?

2951
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:37,430
Thank you.

2952
02:08:37,430 --> 02:08:38,510
Thank you, Zahando.

2953
02:08:39,370 --> 02:08:40,510
Oh, it's getting late.

2954
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:41,730
I should go home soon.

2955
02:08:43,530 --> 02:08:45,290
That was so much money.

2956
02:08:45,570 --> 02:08:46,770
Okay, that was...

2957
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:48,110
She's happy, though!

2958
02:08:48,630 --> 02:08:51,450
I'll be waiting for you, so please come back again!

2959
02:08:52,290 --> 02:08:53,910
Yes, thank you for today.

2960
02:08:55,490 --> 02:08:56,370
Thank you, Kana.

2961
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:57,910
Yay!

2962
02:08:58,210 --> 02:09:01,410
I get to drink delicious alcohol and have fun conversations.

2963
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:03,810
Now I'm motivated for work.

2964
02:09:05,150 --> 02:09:07,250
Hon George, thank you for the super chat.

2965
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:07,650
Thank you.

2966
02:09:07,670 --> 02:09:08,270
Thank you.

2967
02:09:08,830 --> 02:09:10,670
100% safe for work.

2968
02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:11,470
Nice, Doki.

2969
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:15,630
How was I supposed to know?

2970
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:18,190
Guys, we have to earn money.

2971
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:20,730
Guys, we need money, guys.

2972
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:23,630
We have to work for Kana.

2973
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:25,470
Kana, don't forget about me!

2974
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:28,710
Kana, I'm earning more money for you!

2975
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:31,570
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

2976
02:09:31,870 --> 02:09:32,390
Alright.

2977
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:34,470
No, goodbye.

2978
02:09:36,150 --> 02:09:36,670
Goodbye!

2979
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:39,190
Okay, nice.

2980
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:39,850
Alright.

2981
02:09:39,970 --> 02:09:41,070
Kana, Kana, Kana!

2982
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:45,620
What should I drink today?

2983
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:46,680
Beer, wine, champagne?

2984
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:47,920
Let's just get in there first.

2985
02:09:48,160 --> 02:09:49,380
Kana, Kana, Kana!

2986
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:52,890
She's here!

2987
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:56,930
She was waiting!

2988
02:09:58,750 --> 02:09:59,450
For me!

2989
02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:02,970
I'll get the Cassis Orange, please.

2990
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:04,110
Of course.

2991
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:04,910
Can I...

2992
02:10:04,910 --> 02:10:06,210
You know what?

2993
02:10:08,730 --> 02:10:10,530
I think this will get me the Twister.

2994
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:12,830
I think this will get me Twister, guys.

2995
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:14,050
I'm gonna do it.

2996
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:16,310
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

2997
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:17,470
I'm gonna do it.

2998
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:18,950
I would get Twister.

2999
02:10:20,010 --> 02:10:21,270
I'm pretty sure.

3000
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:25,610
I'm sorry.

3001
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:25,770
Guys...

3002
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:27,650
It's okay!

3003
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:29,570
A little bit of debt is okay!

3004
02:10:30,870 --> 02:10:31,510
Guys!

3005
02:10:31,710 --> 02:10:34,050
It'll just be a little bit of debt!

3006
02:10:35,050 --> 02:10:37,210
Our dinner is actually over.

3007
02:10:37,410 --> 02:10:39,310
It doesn't work like that.

3008
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:41,350
What do you mean?!

3009
02:10:42,130 --> 02:10:43,450
It's not the time.

3010
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:45,730
Yes, but it's okay!

3011
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:46,630
I can...

3012
02:10:46,630 --> 02:10:49,250
I can go into a little bit of debt!

3013
02:10:49,970 --> 02:10:50,810
it's fine...

3014
02:10:51,270 --> 02:10:52,010
I swear.

3015
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:54,510
It's too dangerous.

3016
02:10:56,970 --> 02:10:58,670
You guys are cowards!

3017
02:10:59,270 --> 02:11:06,830
Olive, if you don't spend it all for your one true hostess, then what's the point?

3018
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:09,710
Do it for her!

3019
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:12,130
Really?

3020
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:14,170
I'll get you a bottle!

3021
02:11:15,090 --> 02:11:16,130
Do it for her!

3022
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:16,510
Do it for her!

3023
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:18,490
Wow!

3024
02:11:18,490 --> 02:11:19,470
It's a different color!

3025
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:25,830
Kana, Kana, Kana!

3026
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:27,690
I also got you pajamas!

3027
02:11:28,230 --> 02:11:29,110
Kana, Kana, Kana!

3028
02:11:33,210 --> 02:11:33,910
It's okay.

3029
02:11:34,170 --> 02:11:35,950
Will you be willing to accept this?

3030
02:11:36,650 --> 02:11:37,470
Accept this?

3031
02:11:37,650 --> 02:11:39,050
I hope you like it.

3032
02:11:40,430 --> 02:11:41,630
Can I really have it?

3033
02:11:41,670 --> 02:11:42,490
I'm so happy!

3034
02:11:42,630 --> 02:11:43,050
Thank you!

3035
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:43,650
Of course, Kana!

3036
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:45,730
Anything for you!

3037
02:11:47,490 --> 02:11:49,110
There's something I want to talk to you about.

3038
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:50,070
What is it?

3039
02:11:50,130 --> 02:11:51,330
What is it, Kana?

3040
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:55,350
It's okay.

3041
02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:56,410
I have two livers.

3042
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:58,310
I have two livers... No, wait.

3043
02:11:58,430 --> 02:11:58,870
I have one.

3044
02:11:58,990 --> 02:12:05,330
I have two kidneys, two eyes, two ears, two hands, two feet.

3045
02:12:05,510 --> 02:12:07,030
I don't need two.

3046
02:12:08,090 --> 02:12:09,470
One can do the job.

3047
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:10,550
The function.

3048
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:13,510
Actually, forget I mentioned it.

3049
02:12:13,610 --> 02:12:14,370
No, no, tell me!

3050
02:12:14,430 --> 02:12:15,250
I spent a hundred!

3051
02:12:15,250 --> 02:12:18,190
I spent a hundred and eighty thousand yen on you!

3052
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:21,330
For my one true doki, I guess.

3053
02:12:21,530 --> 02:12:23,570
Thank you for the super chat, Santina.

3054
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:24,070
Thank you.

3055
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:26,150
Two lives!

3056
02:12:27,370 --> 02:12:29,110
I can live with half a liver!

3057
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:33,530
This time is to make you feel good, Haito-kun.

3058
02:12:33,650 --> 02:12:35,210
So I can't go and bring my own issues.

3059
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:35,810
No, no!

3060
02:12:35,850 --> 02:12:37,550
I'm a good listener, Kana!

3061
02:12:39,230 --> 02:12:39,990
Not at all.

3062
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:42,410
I'll do anything I can to listen to your problems.

3063
02:12:43,050 --> 02:12:44,510
Thank you, Haito-kun.

3064
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:46,390
Thanks, Haito-kun.

3065
02:12:46,510 --> 02:12:47,790
Then, I'll be kind to you.

3066
02:12:48,390 --> 02:12:50,750
I might take up your offer of kindness then.

3067
02:12:51,010 --> 02:12:52,250
I have ten fingers?

3068
02:12:52,610 --> 02:12:53,970
I don't need ten fingers!

3069
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:55,150
I'll contact you when I get a liver.

3070
02:12:55,150 --> 02:12:57,110
Yeah, your liver regrows, technically!

3071
02:12:57,810 --> 02:12:58,310
I'll be happy to help you.

3072
02:12:59,290 --> 02:13:01,930
My dad from back in the countryside called me.

3073
02:13:02,010 --> 02:13:03,490
He told me to come back.

3074
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:08,890
I still have things I want to do here, so I told him I can't go home.

3075
02:13:10,570 --> 02:13:14,510
But there's still so much I want to do here, so I told him that I won't return home.

3076
02:13:14,510 --> 02:13:17,150
Don't listen to your father, listen to me!

3077
02:13:21,250 --> 02:13:22,110
I see.

3078
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:26,610
I'm sure he's just worried about his own daughter who lives so far away from him.

3079
02:13:29,170 --> 02:13:31,270
I can donate so much!

3080
02:13:33,070 --> 02:13:34,470
Anything for Kana.

3081
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:41,150
I know, but that's exactly why I feel a little guilty when I mention not wanting to come back.

3082
02:13:41,650 --> 02:13:42,750
I'll be your...

3083
02:13:45,290 --> 02:13:46,190
I'll be your...

3084
02:13:46,190 --> 02:13:46,850
I'll be your new dad.

3085
02:13:49,950 --> 02:13:50,690
Hold on.

3086
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:53,670
I never talked to you about my family back home, right?

3087
02:13:54,550 --> 02:13:56,170
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

3088
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:57,430
Thank you, thank you!

3089
02:13:58,350 --> 02:14:01,550
I'm learning so many new strats from the stream.

3090
02:14:01,730 --> 02:14:05,230
All these unnecessary organs I never see anyway.

3091
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:08,490
Thank you for the super chat.

3092
02:14:08,650 --> 02:14:09,650
Thank you.

3093
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:12,730
I remember you bringing them up briefly.

3094
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:14,570
Remember when we talked about blood types?

3095
02:14:14,570 --> 02:14:15,550
Let's see.

3096
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:17,150
Oh.

3097
02:14:17,150 --> 02:14:20,390
Dad and mom are A and B, right?

3098
02:14:20,590 --> 02:14:22,070
Dad and mom.

3099
02:14:22,910 --> 02:14:25,470
Kaz, I know the answer.

3100
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:27,990
But do you know the answer?

3101
02:14:32,090 --> 02:14:35,050
Kaz, I know what the answers are.

3102
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:37,170
But do you know what it is?

3103
02:14:37,310 --> 02:14:38,630
What was it?

3104
02:14:38,630 --> 02:14:39,870
I'm gonna test you guys.

3105
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:41,070
What was it?

3106
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:46,910
Yeah, yeah, you do.

3107
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:47,150
Oh yeah?

3108
02:14:47,290 --> 02:14:47,850
Prove it!

3109
02:14:47,990 --> 02:14:49,850
Prove that you know the answer, chat.

3110
02:14:50,290 --> 02:14:52,450
Unless you're lying to me.

3111
02:14:56,110 --> 02:14:57,250
I always knew.

3112
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:57,870
I already knew.

3113
02:14:59,590 --> 02:15:00,270
Oh wow.

3114
02:15:00,450 --> 02:15:02,730
I can't believe you even remembered that.

3115
02:15:02,810 --> 02:15:04,510
I'm kind of happy that you knew it.

3116
02:15:05,950 --> 02:15:06,990
Of course, Kana.

3117
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:12,010
As someone that spent at least $10,000 on you, I'll always remember.

3118
02:15:12,010 --> 02:15:16,430
I'm making my dad sad, aren't I?

3119
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:24,210
I don't want him to feel that way at all.

3120
02:15:25,630 --> 02:15:27,990
I won't deny that he doesn't feel sad.

3121
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:31,950
But I'm sure he'll come back to understand your desire to stay there.

3122
02:15:33,370 --> 02:15:35,870
I mean, you're telling him how you really feel after all.

3123
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:38,990
He'll be proud of you and accept your viewpoint for sure.

3124
02:15:38,990 --> 02:15:39,070
I'm sure.

3125
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:44,520
Thanks, Haito-kun.

3126
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:45,640
Of course!

3127
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:46,760
Of course, Kana!

3128
02:15:56,700 --> 02:16:00,400
I can't go home yet because I need to still achieve my goals here.

3129
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:01,560
But do my...

3130
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:02,380
What goals?

3131
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:10,420
I'm actually curious what their goals are.

3132
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:15,620
I'll do my best not to make my dad feel sad too.

3133
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:18,360
I'll call him and talk to him.

3134
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:21,200
I'll talk to him.

3135
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:21,600
I'll talk to him.

3136
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:22,580
I'll talk to him.

3137
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:24,060
I'll talk to him.

3138
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:26,740
Maybe I should call him more often.

3139
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:29,140
Oh, and I have to mention you to him too, of course.

3140
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:29,460
Yes.

3141
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:32,520
That's all dads want to hear.

3142
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:42,580
The guy that's giving so much money to his daughter for her to give attention to him.

3143
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,220
That's what all dads want to hear in the countryside.

3144
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:53,620
I'll tell him how much you uplift me whenever we talk... with money.

3145
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:08,740
But if I tell him that, he might take it in the wrong way.

3146
02:17:08,980 --> 02:17:10,360
You wouldn't like that, would you?

3147
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:12,740
I'll keep it a secret from you, Haito-kun.

3148
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:14,480
I'll keep it a secret from you.

3149
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:17,600
Maybe I'll stay quiet about you for the time being then.

3150
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:18,360
No, I won't.

3151
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:19,680
I don't want to be your secret.

3152
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:22,560
I want to be public, Kana.

3153
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:25,540
Kana, I already told my mom about you, Kana.

3154
02:17:27,220 --> 02:17:28,460
Should I get you more drinks?

3155
02:17:28,580 --> 02:17:29,740
Of course, yes.

3156
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:33,560
Yes, a little bit of debt won't hurt anybody.

3157
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:36,480
I'm going to be so happy later.

3158
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:38,460
Okay, I can't afford much right now.

3159
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:41,750
Okay, apparently somebody said get the special highball.

3160
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:45,890
Because that's her favorite, so I believe you.

3161
02:17:48,850 --> 02:17:49,990
It tastes amazing!

3162
02:17:50,210 --> 02:17:50,690
I love this!

3163
02:17:50,730 --> 02:17:51,510
I fucking knew it!

3164
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:53,190
That someone was me.

3165
02:17:53,230 --> 02:17:54,070
I told myself that.

3166
02:17:56,010 --> 02:17:56,510
Alright.

3167
02:17:58,350 --> 02:17:59,350
Her beautiful...

3168
02:17:59,350 --> 02:18:04,070
Her beautiful bunny tail.

3169
02:18:04,550 --> 02:18:07,070
Okay, I already gave her a present, right?

3170
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:08,330
So...

3171
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:09,430
Um...

3172
02:18:11,230 --> 02:18:11,710
Um...

3173
02:18:12,310 --> 02:18:14,310
Should we have... Let's have food.

3174
02:18:15,390 --> 02:18:16,210
Okay, food.

3175
02:18:16,750 --> 02:18:17,870
We'll have...

3176
02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:19,070
You know what?

3177
02:18:20,610 --> 02:18:23,210
We'll have... You know, we'll try candies.

3178
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:24,450
She likes sweet stuff.

3179
02:18:25,310 --> 02:18:26,470
This is great.

3180
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:27,290
I love this!

3181
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:31,470
Skeleon, thank you for the super chat.

3182
02:18:31,550 --> 02:18:32,390
Thank you, thank you!

3183
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:33,830
Who paid money for attention?

3184
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:34,210
Weird.

3185
02:18:34,410 --> 02:18:35,830
Doki, decipher me, please.

3186
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:37,690
Should I make a ginger chewy cookie?

3187
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:40,610
Or hazelnut brown butter cake?

3188
02:18:40,690 --> 02:18:41,590
Thank you for the super chat.

3189
02:18:41,690 --> 02:18:42,330
Thank you, thank you!

3190
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:42,670
You know what?

3191
02:18:42,710 --> 02:18:43,990
Get the brown butter cake.

3192
02:18:44,250 --> 02:18:45,310
Kana likes cake.

3193
02:18:45,570 --> 02:18:47,070
So now we all like cake.

3194
02:18:47,430 --> 02:18:48,630
I already bought sushi.

3195
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:50,550
She didn't give me like a nice answer.

3196
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:53,130
I feel like my hair is getting kinda long.

3197
02:18:53,530 --> 02:18:56,690
Maybe I should book an appointment at the hairdresser soon.

3198
02:18:56,810 --> 02:18:57,610
How much would it cost?

3199
02:18:57,750 --> 02:18:58,190
I got you.

3200
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:06,590
Like short or long or something.

3201
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:09,770
I don't think I have any sort of preference like that.

3202
02:19:09,890 --> 02:19:10,530
I like...

3203
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:12,390
I like Kana shaped hair.

3204
02:19:12,770 --> 02:19:14,010
Then, how about hair color?

3205
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:19,260
How about hair color then?

3206
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:21,880
Do you like brighter tones or something darker?

3207
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:24,260
Lighter colors are nice.

3208
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:26,140
But so are darker ones.

3209
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:33,740
Look, my entire preferences is just you now, okay?

3210
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:34,300
I...

3211
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:38,900
I'm a little annoyed at how much you don't seem to care all that much.

3212
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:45,240
I don't care what other people think.

3213
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:47,000
I don't care what other people think.

3214
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:47,740
I don't care what other people think.

3215
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:48,540
I don't care what other people think.

3216
02:19:48,540 --> 02:19:51,220
It's like how like girls are like, do you notice anything different?

3217
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:53,820
And the guys are just like, uh...

3218
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:58,020
Your hair...

3219
02:19:58,480 --> 02:20:01,200
I think you can at least seem a little more interested, you know?

3220
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:03,840
It feels like you don't care about my hair at all.

3221
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,640
Sorry, I wasn't trying to say that at all.

3222
02:20:11,300 --> 02:20:14,200
I'm saying that you could pull off any hairstyle or color.

3223
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:15,880
I really don't mean that.

3224
02:20:16,060 --> 02:20:16,920
I really do mean that.

3225
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:17,900
Sorry, I really do mean that.

3226
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:23,080
Of course!

3227
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,340
Kana, you're doubting me already?

3228
02:20:25,580 --> 02:20:29,640
I bought you the fucking 150k yen champagne!

3229
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:33,040
And I only had 146!

3230
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:36,460
I do.

3231
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:40,560
Besides not having a preference isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it?

3232
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:42,820
That means you can make anything work, Kana!

3233
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:50,860
I can promise you that no matter what hairstyle you decide to go with, I'll visit you the same amount as always.

3234
02:20:51,180 --> 02:20:53,280
Look, I haven't even talked to another woman!

3235
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:55,180
I only talk to you, Kana!

3236
02:20:56,500 --> 02:21:03,500
I'm sure I'll become more attracted to you going forward, but I'll never start disliking you because you changed your appearance.

3237
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:05,140
If

3238
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:12,680
you say something like that, I can't say anything back.

3239
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:17,280
That's so unfair, Haito-kun.

3240
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:21,560
I can't say anything back when you say something so kind like, Oh my god, Haito, you did it!

3241
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:23,060
You finally clutched it!

3242
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:24,340
For once in your life!

3243
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:26,680
Of course!

3244
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:27,820
Of course!

3245
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,220
Let's talk more!

3246
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:33,960
Alright.

3247
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,700
I'll get my... You know what?

3248
02:21:36,860 --> 02:21:37,900
I'll change it up.

3249
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:39,260
I'll get the oolong highball.

3250
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:42,620
And then, I know you love the special highball.

3251
02:21:43,220 --> 02:21:44,400
It tastes amazing!

3252
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:45,720
I love this!

3253
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:49,160
Yay!

3254
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:53,500
Her beautiful hair that we all love.

3255
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:58,620
And her beautiful hands that I have a photo of.

3256
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:04,220
Okay, I'm not reading that out.

3257
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:07,200
What are you doing?

3258
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:15,840
I'm just practicing my pronunciation.

3259
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:19,200
You know how this job is all about talking with others, right?

3260
02:22:19,420 --> 02:22:21,660
So I do all sorts of vocal exercises.

3261
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:23,840
So I don't mess up my words.

3262
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:26,100
Oh, your enunciation, huh?

3263
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:29,680
I suppose that would make sense to practice so you don't fumble your sentences.

3264
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:33,360
I say as I never practice and now you can tell why I...

3265
02:22:34,220 --> 02:22:37,180
You can tell why I pronounce things the way I do.

3266
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:41,480
She sells seashells by the seashore.

3267
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:43,340
Okay, that is definitely not it.

3268
02:22:47,220 --> 02:22:51,180
That's definitely not the translation to what she said.

3269
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:57,840
Tone twisters, impressive.

3270
02:22:57,980 --> 02:23:00,260
You didn't even stumble, Kana-chan.

3271
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:15,470
I used to be in the drama club back in the day, actually.

3272
02:23:15,630 --> 02:23:18,130
We used to do this sort of practice all the time.

3273
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:18,850
I used to be in the drama club back in the day, actually.

3274
02:23:18,890 --> 02:23:19,250
I used to be in the drama club back in the day, actually.

3275
02:23:20,310 --> 02:23:22,570
You were in the drama club?

3276
02:23:22,790 --> 02:23:23,990
Now I'm curious.

3277
02:23:27,830 --> 02:23:30,330
Did you mainly practice acting?

3278
02:23:30,650 --> 02:23:33,410
Okay, I don't think I should say these.

3279
02:23:33,650 --> 02:23:35,330
Okay, did you mainly practice acting?

3280
02:23:39,270 --> 02:23:40,630
You're not an actor?

3281
02:23:40,790 --> 02:23:44,310
Then why the fuck were you doing fucking word exercise?

3282
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:51,150
Why the fuck...

3283
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:51,710
Okay.

3284
02:23:56,650 --> 02:24:01,090
Of course I would assume you're an actor for doing word exercise.

3285
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:03,550
I was on the sound team.

3286
02:24:04,090 --> 02:24:04,730
And...

3287
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:11,610
I was literally... I was like the sound... I was a behind the scenes sound team.

3288
02:24:11,730 --> 02:24:15,230
We did not practice fucking sound exercise.

3289
02:24:17,370 --> 02:24:20,550
Actors are the pinnacle of what most people in drama want to become.

3290
02:24:20,590 --> 02:24:21,130
Aren't they?

3291
02:24:21,130 --> 02:24:22,730
But I wasn't like that.

3292
02:24:24,010 --> 02:24:25,670
I was part of the lighting crew.

3293
02:24:25,830 --> 02:24:27,170
I was like lighting and sound.

3294
02:24:27,710 --> 02:24:29,730
I was part of the lighting and sound crew.

3295
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:38,070
Given the actors, their spotlight, and thinking about light positions and whatnot...

3296
02:24:38,070 --> 02:24:39,550
Mostly on the lights, though.

3297
02:24:39,610 --> 02:24:40,890
I worked mostly on the lights.

3298
02:24:40,970 --> 02:24:43,570
But if we needed... if our sound guy wasn't there...

3299
02:24:43,570 --> 02:24:46,030
Like, I would like attempt to do the sound.

3300
02:24:47,230 --> 02:24:49,430
Because I had like seniority.

3301
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:53,830
But I was like... I was... what was it called?

3302
02:24:54,010 --> 02:24:56,470
Like the... the crew... the crew in charge.

3303
02:24:56,690 --> 02:24:57,630
The behind the scenes crew.

3304
02:24:58,190 --> 02:25:00,790
I actually got like... back then...

3305
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:01,810
Okay, sorry Akana.

3306
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:03,790
This is my turn to share my story.

3307
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:07,030
But like... in one... one of the years...

3308
02:25:07,030 --> 02:25:09,010
Back then, I think in like high school...

3309
02:25:09,010 --> 02:25:12,770
There was a convention slash conference for like...

3310
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:14,630
Theater people.

3311
02:25:15,130 --> 02:25:17,530
One time I was selected for like the drama side.

3312
02:25:17,730 --> 02:25:20,410
But like the second time I was selected to do the behind the scenes.

3313
02:25:20,410 --> 02:25:22,930
And like only several students...

3314
02:25:22,930 --> 02:25:26,870
I think like only three people are selected per school...

3315
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:28,770
To go represent the school.

3316
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:31,630
For this like... drama conference or whatever.

3317
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:33,630
And basically like...

3318
02:25:33,630 --> 02:25:35,270
Each school selects three students.

3319
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:36,330
One will be the band.

3320
02:25:36,590 --> 02:25:38,990
One will be like the... from the band class.

3321
02:25:39,410 --> 02:25:40,930
One will be in the acting.

3322
02:25:41,130 --> 02:25:42,630
And the other will be like the technician.

3323
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:44,450
So I got selected for...

3324
02:25:44,450 --> 02:25:45,970
One time I got selected for acting.

3325
02:25:46,270 --> 02:25:49,010
And then the other time I got selected for technician.

3326
02:25:49,010 --> 02:25:50,830
So like I've done like...

3327
02:25:50,830 --> 02:25:53,210
Technician and acting for the conference.

3328
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:55,170
And then it's basically all the students...

3329
02:25:55,170 --> 02:25:57,190
From each school come together...

3330
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:58,890
And produce like some show.

3331
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:02,170
Like it's there to like improve your knowledge.

3332
02:26:03,330 --> 02:26:03,970
Um...

3333
02:26:03,970 --> 02:26:06,050
It's to improve your knowledge and your skill set.

3334
02:26:06,210 --> 02:26:07,570
And then they all come together.

3335
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:10,090
Like each school comes together...

3336
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:12,730
To make this giant show based off of like...

3337
02:26:12,730 --> 02:26:13,290
Um...

3338
02:26:13,290 --> 02:26:17,130
All these like really talented individuals in each like sector.

3339
02:26:17,570 --> 02:26:18,850
And uh...

3340
02:26:19,010 --> 02:26:20,370
And that's why this is...

3341
02:26:20,370 --> 02:26:20,490
Um...

3342
02:26:20,490 --> 02:26:22,490
It's so f******t that she was like...

3343
02:26:22,490 --> 02:26:23,690
I was part of the lighting...

3344
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:24,470
Lighting crew.

3345
02:26:24,730 --> 02:26:27,050
And she's trying to like bait me with the pronunciation.

3346
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:30,090
Like how is that supposed to know she wasn't lightning?

3347
02:26:30,890 --> 02:26:31,330
How?

3348
02:26:31,550 --> 02:26:33,070
How is it supposed to know she wasn't lighting?

3349
02:26:33,450 --> 02:26:35,110
And she talked about pronunciation...

3350
02:26:35,110 --> 02:26:36,170
And tongue twisters.

3351
02:26:40,150 --> 02:26:40,950
I see.

3352
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:43,530
I just assumed that most people in the drama club...

3353
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:44,730
Will want to act more than anything.

3354
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:48,590
F**king poser...

3355
02:26:49,130 --> 02:26:50,530
Did I tell you the honest truth?

3356
02:26:54,650 --> 02:26:55,870
I wanted to act too.

3357
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:57,570
Look guys, this is why I'm not an actor.

3358
02:26:57,730 --> 02:26:58,790
I don't do tongue twisters.

3359
02:26:58,890 --> 02:27:00,330
Of course I fumble with my words.

3360
02:27:01,050 --> 02:27:02,130
She was right!

3361
02:27:02,430 --> 02:27:04,110
I fumble with my words!

3362
02:27:06,090 --> 02:27:07,630
That's why I joined to begin with.

3363
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:13,970
Sara, thank you.

3364
02:27:13,970 --> 02:27:15,350
Seriously, thank you for the super chat.

3365
02:27:15,410 --> 02:27:15,650
Thank you.

3366
02:27:15,650 --> 02:27:16,210
Thank you.

3367
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:18,130
Girl could come back.

3368
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:19,710
Thank you for your super chat by the way!

3369
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:22,190
Girl could come back looking like a tomato.

3370
02:27:22,370 --> 02:27:23,590
Little does she know we're into that.

3371
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:25,450
Thank you for existing, Doki.

3372
02:27:25,790 --> 02:27:27,830
I didn't have the courage to act in front of an audience.

3373
02:27:28,330 --> 02:27:30,690
So I panicked and went for the lighting crew...

3374
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:32,330
position instead.

3375
02:27:35,850 --> 02:27:36,870
Don't get me wrong.

3376
02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:39,530
I enjoyed doing the lighting.

3377
02:27:43,670 --> 02:27:45,530
I really did give it my all.

3378
02:27:45,650 --> 02:27:47,830
While learning the importance of behind the scenes work.

3379
02:27:47,950 --> 02:27:50,250
Also for the conference, we had to travel.

3380
02:27:50,490 --> 02:27:51,990
So it's not like in our area.

3381
02:27:52,250 --> 02:27:57,650
The school would pay for the travel cost to whatever school was hosting it at that time.

3382
02:27:58,690 --> 02:28:03,970
But because I was working behind the scenes, I could see the actor performing in the spotlight from so close.

3383
02:28:04,030 --> 02:28:06,950
So we would travel really far at one point.

3384
02:28:15,830 --> 02:28:19,570
My dreams kept getting bigger and bigger while me really striving towards them.

3385
02:28:19,710 --> 02:28:21,710
And that brings me to today, I guess.

3386
02:28:24,210 --> 02:28:26,150
I'd love to see you in action one of these days.

3387
02:28:26,470 --> 02:28:27,890
Working on the lights, Kana-chan.

3388
02:28:28,190 --> 02:28:30,110
She's told me she wants to be a fucking actor!

3389
02:28:41,550 --> 02:28:44,470
Well, I guess I could do my best to try once again.

3390
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:47,530
I hope one day I can bring you the good news that I'm back at it.

3391
02:28:49,230 --> 02:28:49,590
Yes!

3392
02:28:51,790 --> 02:28:52,230
I'm going to be a good actor!

3393
02:28:52,230 --> 02:28:52,730
Oh, come on!

3394
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:54,270
Twister, twister, twister, twister!

3395
02:28:55,410 --> 02:28:55,850
Yeah!

3396
02:28:58,070 --> 02:29:00,150
I'm sure you'll have fun if you went through with it.

3397
02:29:00,190 --> 02:29:00,290
I'm sure you'll have fun if you went through with it.

3398
02:29:00,290 --> 02:29:01,030
Come on, let's do it!

3399
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:02,130
Oh my god, yes!

3400
02:29:02,310 --> 02:29:03,730
Please don't be the hand game!

3401
02:29:03,870 --> 02:29:04,890
It's a 50-50!

3402
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:09,170
It's a 50-50!

3403
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:11,810
It's a 50-50!

3404
02:29:11,810 --> 02:29:12,230
Yes!

3405
02:29:16,270 --> 02:29:16,710
Yes!

3406
02:29:19,710 --> 02:29:23,550
You can spin the roulette every time you pay a fee!

3407
02:29:23,950 --> 02:29:30,030
The castle moves their limbs according to the instructions given on the roulette wheel.

3408
02:29:30,170 --> 02:29:33,210
Have fun and see how long you can last.

3409
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:34,630
Alright, let's start.

3410
02:29:35,390 --> 02:29:38,090
Okay, you first, Kana-chan.

3411
02:29:38,310 --> 02:29:39,350
Right hand on yellow.

3412
02:29:40,470 --> 02:29:42,210
Oh my god!

3413
02:29:42,430 --> 02:29:44,090
Okay, let's have an over...

3414
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:45,330
Oh...

3415
02:29:45,330 --> 02:29:45,930
Oh...

3416
02:29:51,290 --> 02:29:53,130
Okay, yes, spin the roulette.

3417
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:54,230
I can keep going.

3418
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:57,770
Left foot on red.

3419
02:29:58,930 --> 02:29:59,570
Wow!

3420
02:29:59,910 --> 02:30:01,350
What the fuck!

3421
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:05,150
I'm sure dad is very happy about your job!

3422
02:30:06,690 --> 02:30:07,330
Wow!

3423
02:30:09,030 --> 02:30:10,630
Okay, spin again.

3424
02:30:10,970 --> 02:30:12,050
She won the...

3425
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:14,450
I won the 50-50, guys!

3426
02:30:15,650 --> 02:30:17,610
Alright, left hand on yellow!

3427
02:30:19,070 --> 02:30:20,150
There we go!

3428
02:30:22,670 --> 02:30:23,670
Can I like...

3429
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:24,190
Okay, yeah.

3430
02:30:24,350 --> 02:30:25,310
Okay, there we go.

3431
02:30:25,650 --> 02:30:26,630
Alright, okay.

3432
02:30:27,470 --> 02:30:28,490
There we go.

3433
02:30:28,750 --> 02:30:29,850
Spin the roulette.

3434
02:30:29,990 --> 02:30:31,690
Yes, I guess we keep spinning!

3435
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:36,350
Right foot on red.

3436
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:38,090
Where's the...

3437
02:30:38,090 --> 02:30:39,210
Oh god.

3438
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:40,210
I...

3439
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:45,590
Guys, I'm gonna have to look up.

3440
02:30:48,190 --> 02:30:50,010
Guys, I'm gonna have to look up.

3441
02:30:53,430 --> 02:30:54,710
Guys, I'm gonna have to look up.

3442
02:30:54,710 --> 02:30:55,130
I feel...

3443
02:30:55,130 --> 02:30:56,450
I feel like it'll...

3444
02:30:56,450 --> 02:30:56,590
No!

3445
02:30:56,910 --> 02:30:57,550
No!

3446
02:31:02,970 --> 02:31:05,250
So, lower angle, you'll be like this, right?

3447
02:31:05,910 --> 02:31:06,230
Wow!

3448
02:31:06,410 --> 02:31:07,350
There we go!

3449
02:31:10,850 --> 02:31:13,290
Okay, right foot on... okay.

3450
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:14,630
Guys.

3451
02:31:15,830 --> 02:31:17,830
Guys, I feel like... guys.

3452
02:31:18,090 --> 02:31:20,470
Okay, I feel like I need to step in real fast.

3453
02:31:25,890 --> 02:31:26,650
There we go.

3454
02:31:26,650 --> 02:31:27,090
Okay.

3455
02:31:36,930 --> 02:31:38,830
But I got this.

3456
02:31:49,050 --> 02:31:50,990
What do you mean?

3457
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:53,550
What do you mean?

3458
02:31:54,270 --> 02:31:55,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

3459
02:31:56,210 --> 02:31:57,690
You don't want me here?

3460
02:32:01,110 --> 02:32:01,830
Phew.

3461
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:03,130
It was fun.

3462
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:03,930
Wasn't it?

3463
02:32:04,010 --> 02:32:05,330
I was sweating a little.

3464
02:32:06,790 --> 02:32:11,230
I've been so locked in in my life.

3465
02:32:13,490 --> 02:32:16,970
When it gets so late, I guess I'll head back soon.

3466
02:32:19,770 --> 02:32:21,190
Oh my god.

3467
02:32:21,610 --> 02:32:22,910
Oh, hey, nice.

3468
02:32:24,210 --> 02:32:24,810
Nice.

3469
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:29,150
Alright.

3470
02:32:29,590 --> 02:32:31,590
I want to be with you a little longer.

3471
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:33,670
Oh my god.

3472
02:32:33,750 --> 02:32:34,990
You're so in.

3473
02:32:37,010 --> 02:32:43,370
I don't want to just say bye to you now, but I don't want you to feel pressured by now either.

3474
02:32:45,590 --> 02:32:51,550
When the cast members are in a good mood, you might be invited to afters.

3475
02:32:51,590 --> 02:32:54,870
Going out with the cast members outside the shop.

3476
02:32:55,110 --> 02:32:56,570
It seems that you'll treat...

3477
02:32:56,570 --> 02:32:56,990
Of course.

3478
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:58,690
I'll do it.

3479
02:32:59,710 --> 02:33:01,310
It'll cost you to go after.

3480
02:33:01,390 --> 02:33:01,570
You're so in.

3481
02:33:01,570 --> 02:33:01,790
Yes.

3482
02:33:01,850 --> 02:33:04,050
Let's go somewhere right now.

3483
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:05,630
Okay, guys.

3484
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:06,750
We're going to do it.

3485
02:33:10,990 --> 02:33:11,970
Let's go somewhere.

3486
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:12,630
Really?

3487
02:33:13,330 --> 02:33:15,770
I guess you wanted to be with me somewhere.

3488
02:33:17,710 --> 02:33:19,010
Guys, we got to.

3489
02:33:19,250 --> 02:33:21,190
She wants to do after hours.

3490
02:33:22,010 --> 02:33:24,350
No, you're blocking Kana Episod.

3491
02:33:24,590 --> 02:33:25,950
Thank you for the super chat.

3492
02:33:26,050 --> 02:33:26,390
Thank you.

3493
02:33:26,410 --> 02:33:26,930
Thank you.

3494
02:33:27,310 --> 02:33:28,710
This is my gambling.

3495
02:33:29,010 --> 02:33:29,370
Thank you.

3496
02:33:30,130 --> 02:33:30,750
Thank you.

3497
02:33:31,150 --> 02:33:31,530
Thank you.

3498
02:33:31,530 --> 02:33:31,550
Thank you.

3499
02:33:31,550 --> 02:33:33,450
I'll leave the location up to you.

3500
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:35,310
I know it'll be fun no matter where we go.

3501
02:33:35,630 --> 02:33:37,210
If I'm with you.

3502
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:41,590
Okay, she's going to get ready.

3503
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:42,350
She's going to change.

3504
02:33:46,870 --> 02:33:47,530
Oh my God.

3505
02:33:47,550 --> 02:33:48,270
I'm so in.

3506
02:33:48,490 --> 02:33:49,830
Oh my God.

3507
02:33:50,590 --> 02:33:51,730
Why are you crying?

3508
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:52,770
Why?

3509
02:33:52,850 --> 02:33:54,270
Is it because I'm broke?

3510
02:33:55,490 --> 02:33:56,230
I can't.

3511
02:33:56,330 --> 02:33:57,430
I just use my handkerchief.

3512
02:33:57,670 --> 02:33:58,750
Oh my God.

3513
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:05,130
Where are we going to go with negative cash?

3514
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:05,510
I'm so in.

3515
02:34:06,410 --> 02:34:08,170
Don't look at my face too much.

3516
02:34:14,570 --> 02:34:16,230
I didn't think I was going to cry this much.

3517
02:34:16,450 --> 02:34:17,450
My face looks awful.

3518
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:19,010
Oh, did we just finish watching a movie?

3519
02:34:19,590 --> 02:34:20,390
That was amazing.

3520
02:34:20,850 --> 02:34:23,530
I think this has definitely landed my top three movies now.

3521
02:34:23,610 --> 02:34:26,890
Oh, guys, I don't even get to see that movie.

3522
02:34:28,750 --> 02:34:29,950
That's how broke I was.

3523
02:34:30,010 --> 02:34:31,270
They cut off the movie content.

3524
02:34:35,810 --> 02:34:36,550
Your face?

3525
02:34:36,770 --> 02:34:37,750
I think so too.

3526
02:34:37,930 --> 02:34:38,430
I like this.

3527
02:34:38,830 --> 02:34:40,010
Just previous work.

3528
02:34:40,090 --> 02:34:41,030
But this might be my face.

3529
02:34:41,050 --> 02:34:41,250
It's my favorite.

3530
02:34:41,770 --> 02:34:43,750
You sure know your movies, Kana-chan.

3531
02:34:48,530 --> 02:34:50,370
I'm trying to be an actress, remember?

3532
02:34:50,610 --> 02:34:52,070
I watch a bunch of movies.

3533
02:34:56,910 --> 02:35:00,830
But movies are definitely more fun to watch with friends rather than by yourself.

3534
02:35:07,210 --> 02:35:09,210
And talk about your thoughts afterwards.

3535
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:11,670
About things you like or what scenes stood out.

3536
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:13,690
That sort of thing is super fun.

3537
02:35:13,690 --> 02:35:13,910
Fun!

3538
02:35:15,510 --> 02:35:19,070
Usually I watch things by myself, but you might be right about this one, Kana-chan.

3539
02:35:22,570 --> 02:35:24,110
Oh my gosh, she's gonna kajumbo it.

3540
02:35:24,610 --> 02:35:27,550
I need to write a review of this movie the moment I get home.

3541
02:35:28,470 --> 02:35:29,350
You write reviews?

3542
02:35:38,070 --> 02:35:40,390
Yep, I write them down to journal my thoughts.

3543
02:35:40,470 --> 02:35:43,490
Things like which scenes I remember or which actors stood out.

3544
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:49,930
Are you gonna write about the twister?

3545
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:57,150
But today's journaling might end up being a bit more than just a movie review.

3546
02:35:57,410 --> 02:35:59,430
Oh no, she's gonna write about the twister.

3547
02:35:59,910 --> 02:36:01,030
What do you mean?

3548
02:36:05,750 --> 02:36:09,270
It's another 15k for the movie.

3549
02:36:10,710 --> 02:36:12,630
Because I watched it with you.

3550
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:16,390
I feel like I'm gonna end up writing more about my time with you.

3551
02:36:16,430 --> 02:36:18,510
Just please don't show it to your dad, Kana.

3552
02:36:18,670 --> 02:36:20,370
Just don't let your family see it.

3553
02:36:20,370 --> 02:36:20,910
Just don't let them see your journal.

3554
02:36:21,050 --> 02:36:22,210
That's all I ask.

3555
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:24,310
I'd love to read the end result.

3556
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:34,290
Nope, not even a sentence because it's a secret.

3557
02:36:35,010 --> 02:36:35,930
Oh god.

3558
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:38,010
Oh my god, it's night time.

3559
02:36:38,630 --> 02:36:40,710
She's gonna give me a gift?

3560
02:36:44,210 --> 02:36:45,970
Oh, birthday ticket!

3561
02:36:47,490 --> 02:36:49,730
Is this an invitation to your birthday?

3562
02:36:50,370 --> 02:36:50,490
Yes.

3563
02:36:52,290 --> 02:36:53,430
It's my birthday.

3564
02:36:53,770 --> 02:36:55,350
Her birthday is coming up.

3565
02:36:55,530 --> 02:36:56,870
I hope I can spend it with you.

3566
02:37:00,330 --> 02:37:02,590
Wait, what do we get to do on her birthday?

3567
02:37:03,850 --> 02:37:05,110
Why is Doki in the...

3568
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:05,790
You know why.

3569
02:37:05,890 --> 02:37:08,190
You know why it's in the raid.

3570
02:37:10,810 --> 02:37:11,950
Thanks, Kana-chan.

3571
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:21,820
The movie you saw today was amazing.

3572
02:37:22,060 --> 02:37:23,440
Wait, I have to save up for it?

3573
02:37:23,560 --> 02:37:24,280
What do you mean?

3574
02:37:24,500 --> 02:37:24,800
Did you have fun?

3575
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:28,080
Because I basically bought her presents.

3576
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:30,380
You had to... you get to buy her presents?

3577
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:32,260
Did you... Of course I did!

3578
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:33,780
Of course I did!

3579
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:35,420
Because I was with you!

3580
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:37,940
Right.

3581
02:37:38,080 --> 02:37:40,420
There is another movie around the corner that looks really good.

3582
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:42,420
I hope we can watch that one together.

3583
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:42,880
I hope we can watch that one together.

3584
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:47,520
Then, let's go to Wawa's house Chigawa is waiting for.

3585
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:51,500
You'll have to be careful and go home.

3586
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:55,020
I need to go home to see Wawa-chan.

3587
02:37:55,260 --> 02:37:57,120
You stay safe going home too, okay?

3588
02:37:57,440 --> 02:37:59,580
Right, tell Wawa-chan I said hi.

3589
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:00,740
I'll see you later.

3590
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:04,680
Oh my god, I have an after-fees?

3591
02:38:06,100 --> 02:38:06,660
Okay...

3592
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:11,700
That's really... Is that $150?

3593
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:17,660
How fucking expensive was the... Why is the club charging me the money?

3594
02:38:17,660 --> 02:38:21,560
Why is the hostess club charging me the...

3595
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:31,180
Isn't that $150 US?

3596
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:35,200
Or like a hundred... Why is the movie so...

3597
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:40,520
It's a hundred... Why is it a hundred dollars for the movie?

3598
02:38:41,220 --> 02:38:44,780
Movie tickets are like... I don't know... 20, 30?

3599
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:47,500
At least I feel so good at work.

3600
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:52,920
Did you buy snacks?

3601
02:38:55,480 --> 02:38:58,040
I got the... I spent way too much money.

3602
02:38:58,100 --> 02:38:59,260
I don't have enough money.

3603
02:38:59,340 --> 02:39:00,220
I need to borrow.

3604
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:03,320
Oh my god, when is her birthday?

3605
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:05,860
It literally doesn't... Okay.

3606
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:09,160
It's on August 13th.

3607
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:10,640
Wait, what's the shop?

3608
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:13,020
Oh my god!

3609
02:39:18,340 --> 02:39:19,700
Oh my god!

3610
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:21,840
When are you ever gonna wear this dress?

3611
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:28,920
A hundred and fifty thousand...

3612
02:39:29,700 --> 02:39:33,540
Oh my god... Oh my god...

3613
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:39,360
Guys, I think this... Guys, I got to play Twister.

3614
02:39:39,380 --> 02:39:41,280
I think this is a good time to call it.

3615
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:43,480
I got what I wanted.

3616
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:51,800
Guys, I... Guys, I got... I got Twister.

3617
02:39:51,940 --> 02:39:53,340
I think that's okay.

3618
02:39:58,360 --> 02:40:00,180
That's... We peaked, guys.

3619
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:02,720
Guys, we peaked from there.

3620
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:05,120
We... All we wanted to do was play Twister.

3621
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:08,440
I think that was the perfect time to call it.

3622
02:40:08,580 --> 02:40:09,580
I think...

3623
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:10,900
I think it was...

3624
02:40:10,900 --> 02:40:11,640
Daisy!

3625
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:14,220
Daisy, give me the super chat.

3626
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:14,820
Thank you, thank you.

3627
02:40:14,860 --> 02:40:17,580
Guys, I'm fucking... I'm in debt right now.

3628
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:19,560
I can't buy anything.

3629
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:22,040
I'm literally in debt.

3630
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:22,880
Chat!

3631
02:40:28,420 --> 02:40:29,540
Guys, it's okay.

3632
02:40:29,620 --> 02:40:30,820
I had a good day.

3633
02:40:31,060 --> 02:40:33,340
I had a good day.

3634
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,420
Thank you for the super chat.

3635
02:40:35,540 --> 02:40:36,400
Thank you, thank you.

3636
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:42,460
I'm 200,000 yen in debt from host clubs and the collectors are busting down my door to break my kneecaps.

3637
02:40:42,640 --> 02:40:43,220
Let's go!

3638
02:40:43,700 --> 02:40:44,860
Thanks for the stream.

3639
02:40:44,980 --> 02:40:46,080
Thank you for the super chat.

3640
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:47,220
Thank you, thank you.

3641
02:40:47,220 --> 02:40:49,360
Guys... Guys, we...

3642
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:53,520
We lost so much money, but it was all for Kana.

3643
02:40:53,740 --> 02:40:56,380
It was all for Kana, the best girl.

3644
02:40:56,540 --> 02:40:57,720
We did it, chat.

3645
02:40:57,920 --> 02:40:59,760
We fucking did it.

3646
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:01,040
It's okay, guys.

3647
02:41:01,540 --> 02:41:02,360
It's okay.

3648
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:03,120
We made it.

3649
02:41:03,160 --> 02:41:03,680
We peaked.

3650
02:41:05,940 --> 02:41:08,700
I feel so motivated, chat.

3651
02:41:08,920 --> 02:41:11,480
I feel so fucking motivated now.

3652
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:15,660
That was...

3653
02:41:15,660 --> 02:41:17,160
That was an adventure.

3654
02:41:17,220 --> 02:41:19,540
That truly was an adventure.

3655
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:25,080
I think it was good that we didn't keep going.

3656
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:30,340
Because I'm worried that I think the mafia was actually going to go for me if I kept going.

3657
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:33,440
So, like, we gotta know when to quit, you know?

3658
02:41:33,500 --> 02:41:34,160
We gotta...

3659
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:39,020
Guys, I think I like my body organs.

3660
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:42,400
Guys, I think, like, you know...

3661
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:44,660
I thought about it.

3662
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:47,200
And, like, I feel like maybe I do need to get...

3663
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:48,440
I think I do need to get both my kidneys, you know, chat?

3664
02:41:48,580 --> 02:41:48,980
Maybe...

3665
02:41:48,980 --> 02:41:52,540
Maybe I do need both my kidneys and both my lungs.

3666
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:53,380
I don't know.

3667
02:41:53,440 --> 02:41:54,320
Just a maybe.

3668
02:41:56,160 --> 02:41:57,980
Rampa, thank you for the super chat.

3669
02:41:58,120 --> 02:41:58,420
Thank you.

3670
02:41:58,420 --> 02:41:58,960
Thank you.

3671
02:41:59,440 --> 02:42:00,200
Wow, Doki.

3672
02:42:00,280 --> 02:42:01,680
You're just gonna twist her and leave?

3673
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:02,560
Yes.

3674
02:42:03,060 --> 02:42:03,540
Absolutely.

3675
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:09,800
After Kana fucking charged me a hundred dollars for the fucking movie tickets.

3676
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:12,620
I don't know, guys.

3677
02:42:12,980 --> 02:42:14,760
Like, I thought she was perfect.

3678
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:17,580
But then she buys movie snacks.

3679
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:19,160
So, like...

3680
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:25,380
So...

3681
02:42:25,380 --> 02:42:26,840
So, I don't know.

3682
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,440
I feel like that's a little bit of a red flag.

3683
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:30,860
That's a little bit of...

3684
02:42:30,860 --> 02:42:33,340
She buys a hundred dollars worth of movie snacks.

3685
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:37,100
So, like, I feel like it's a little bit of a red flag, guys.

3686
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:41,280
Echo, thank you for the super chat.

3687
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:41,640
Thank you.

3688
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:42,100
Thank you.

3689
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:44,180
Imagine being dead from a gacha game.

3690
02:42:44,180 --> 02:42:44,900
Conan B.

3691
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:46,340
Doki, thank you for the super chat.

3692
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:46,800
Thank you.

3693
02:42:46,820 --> 02:42:47,300
Thank you.

3694
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:49,940
She bought sort of like sixty dollars worth of movie food.

3695
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:52,480
And that's like one popcorn and a coke.

3696
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:56,980
And like, at that point, I feel like, you know, Kana might be a little too rich for me.

3697
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:57,960
For my taste.

3698
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:04,580
Granny, thank you for the super chat.

3699
02:43:04,660 --> 02:43:04,940
Thank you.

3700
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:05,520
Thank you.

3701
02:43:05,660 --> 02:43:07,480
Broken Bun, thank you for the super chat.

3702
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:07,860
Thank you.

3703
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:08,420
Thank you.

3704
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:11,540
Got a gamble to make even for Kana's birthday.

3705
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:13,100
Thank you for the super chat.

3706
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:13,480
Thank you.

3707
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:14,120
Thank you.

3708
02:43:14,220 --> 02:43:15,960
Thank you for the super chat.

3709
02:43:16,040 --> 02:43:16,280
Thank you.

3710
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:16,660
Thank you.

3711
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:19,500
Glad to know Doki has the same spending habits we do.

3712
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:21,700
It's reassuring knowing we're all broke together.

3713
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:23,560
Thank you for the super chat.

3714
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:23,860
Thank you.

3715
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:24,020
Thank you.

3716
02:43:24,020 --> 02:43:24,540
You know what?

3717
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,440
It wouldn't hurt to gamble, right?

3718
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:27,100
You know what?

3719
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:27,240
We're...

3720
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:28,180
Alright, guys.

3721
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:29,400
Guys, okay.

3722
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:30,440
We're just gonna...

3723
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:34,200
Guys, all I'm saying is that we might as well...

3724
02:43:39,670 --> 02:43:40,550
I'm saying...

3725
02:43:41,630 --> 02:43:43,010
We might as well...

3726
02:43:43,010 --> 02:43:44,230
What's the worst that could happen?

3727
02:43:44,230 --> 02:43:44,990
You know?

3728
02:43:45,230 --> 02:43:46,590
Oh, shit.

3729
02:43:46,670 --> 02:43:47,410
Okay, guys.

3730
02:43:47,810 --> 02:43:48,810
We can continue.

3731
02:43:49,010 --> 02:43:50,990
What's the worst that could happen, guys?

3732
02:43:51,690 --> 02:43:52,370
Like, you...

3733
02:43:52,370 --> 02:43:53,790
We can't get worse, guys.

3734
02:43:54,230 --> 02:43:55,070
We can't...

3735
02:43:55,070 --> 02:43:56,990
We can get worse, possibly.

3736
02:43:58,150 --> 02:43:58,630
Right?

3737
02:43:59,730 --> 02:44:00,810
Oh, guys.

3738
02:44:01,330 --> 02:44:02,850
What's the worst that could happen?

3739
02:44:03,970 --> 02:44:05,330
Surely, this is it.

3740
02:44:05,450 --> 02:44:08,190
You have to lose some to gain money.

3741
02:44:08,350 --> 02:44:08,830
Chat.

3742
02:44:09,090 --> 02:44:11,050
Like, it's not gonna come in for free.

3743
02:44:11,170 --> 02:44:13,590
You have to take risks to get your money.

3744
02:44:13,690 --> 02:44:14,210
Oh, shit.

3745
02:44:14,210 --> 02:44:14,410
Oh, see!

3746
02:44:14,610 --> 02:44:15,610
9,000.

3747
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:16,510
We can keep going.

3748
02:44:16,850 --> 02:44:17,810
I told you.

3749
02:44:17,910 --> 02:44:21,650
And the next one will be, like, plus 20,000 after that, guys.

3750
02:44:21,890 --> 02:44:23,710
Actually, that would be, like, plus 20k.

3751
02:44:24,030 --> 02:44:25,830
Because what's the worst that could happen?

3752
02:44:26,390 --> 02:44:27,570
Like, I could lose more.

3753
02:44:27,850 --> 02:44:28,190
Now, see?

3754
02:44:28,310 --> 02:44:29,430
It's just 1,000 yen.

3755
02:44:29,530 --> 02:44:30,610
That's just $10.

3756
02:44:31,250 --> 02:44:32,410
That's just $10.

3757
02:44:32,510 --> 02:44:34,090
Being, like, 500...

3758
02:44:34,090 --> 02:44:34,300
Like...

3759
02:44:37,130 --> 02:44:38,190
No, it's okay.

3760
02:44:38,990 --> 02:44:40,150
I'm good for my money.

3761
02:44:40,230 --> 02:44:40,970
You guys know that.

3762
02:44:41,950 --> 02:44:42,370
Okay, but...

3763
02:44:43,670 --> 02:44:45,110
Okay, maybe I should stop.

3764
02:44:45,250 --> 02:44:47,550
Maybe I... I mean, 100k and...

3765
02:44:47,550 --> 02:44:49,250
That is up exactly, Kaz!

3766
02:44:49,310 --> 02:44:50,170
Thank you for the super chat!

3767
02:44:50,250 --> 02:44:50,890
Thank you, thank you!

3768
02:44:50,990 --> 02:44:51,470
It's okay!

3769
02:44:51,610 --> 02:44:53,070
The government will bail me out!

3770
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:58,030
The creosus at this level of depth.

3771
02:44:58,150 --> 02:44:59,070
That isn't a red flag.

3772
02:44:59,290 --> 02:45:00,950
It's a ba... See, I told you!

3773
02:45:01,070 --> 02:45:02,490
25,000 yen!

3774
02:45:03,290 --> 02:45:04,830
Guys, I'm almost out of debt!

3775
02:45:06,670 --> 02:45:08,670
Guys... guys, I'm almost out of debt.

3776
02:45:08,750 --> 02:45:11,110
And don't worry, the government can bail me out.
