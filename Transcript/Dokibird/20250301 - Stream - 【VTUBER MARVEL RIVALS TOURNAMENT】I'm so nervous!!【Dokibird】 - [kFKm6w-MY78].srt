1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
You just started that shit now?

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,560
Yeah, everyone's like, NOOOOO!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,660
And then I just went live.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,980
No, don't be live!

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,600
Hello to my chat.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,440
Is anyone else live other than me and Jay?

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,080
I think Gomez was gonna.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,440
Oh yeah, that's true.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,300
And if I was going to, then we'd be fucking excited.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,460
Guys, if you guys are like...

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,200
I think Kony's gonna be live too.

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,960
If you guys are like, what happened to...

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,020
We had to kick Beto out of the voice chat because they maxed out our voice chat group thing because we have seven players.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,720
And they were like, we want to make sure nobody stream snipes.

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,380
And I was like, what the fuck do you...

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,840
We have so much to lose.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
It's like, what?

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,140
Oh, they gave the group UIDs.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,760
You have it?

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,720
You see it?

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,840
Wait, the group UIDs?

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,220
Okay, so this is the...

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,680
Sorry, you have to invite this person.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,760
Oh, can I leave the practice round at this point?

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,460
Well, Gomez is making it, so...

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,640
I'm waiting for him to invite me in.

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,740
Oh, there's Kony!

28
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,700
Hey, Kony!

29
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,260
Howdy, y'all.

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,860
Kony, what's up, man?

31
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,700
Hello, Kony.

32
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm sorry Beto can't be in here with us.

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,300
I'm sorry for kicking him out.

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,680
Are you actually sorry, though?

35
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,160
I'm supposed to be in here!

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,920
We're a team!

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,220
Am I supposed to add this person?

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,040
You're supposed to invite this person into the...

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,220
Yeah, invite this person in.

40
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,840
Well, they're in a custody and I can't invite them.

41
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,580
Wait, what?

42
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,320
They didn't invite us.

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,960
No, I can't invite them.

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,020
What the fuck?

45
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,120
Do I have them?

46
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,600
I guess so.

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,940
They didn't add me to any lobbies.

48
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,430
I'm, like, waiting to be added.

49
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,630
I just request to join in.

50
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,070
That's it.

51
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,730
Wait, that worked.

52
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,990
Okay.

53
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,210
No, this is my lobby.

54
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,750
They're supposed to be going in our lobby because we're the top.

55
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,110
I'm so confused.

56
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,930
Yeah, I'm just waiting for them to...

57
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,090
Uh...

58
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,250
I'm just waiting for them to invite me or, like...

59
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,570
Um, let's see.

60
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,270
Who the fuck is in Dead Brain Cells?

61
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:33,950
I don't know.

62
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,930
The leader...

63
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,930
The captain of our Dead Brain Cells...

64
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,150
Um...

65
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,790
Is in a custom lobby and we can't invite them.

66
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,790
Okay, I wrote that.

67
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,580
I just wrote that in the group A general.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,260
Unless we're getting casted.

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,160
I don't know whose matches are getting casted.

70
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,180
I...

71
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,700
I don't know.

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,140
Is there... Did they put, like, a thing for us to look at?

73
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,340
Like, group A?

74
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,980
Is it group A?

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,420
Oh, look.

76
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,820
Looking at the group A stuff.

77
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

78
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,020
Okay.

79
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,460
We are at... We...

80
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,860
Um...

81
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,180
Oh, wait.

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,180
We... Yeah, we told... I messaged it and they're, like...

83
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,620
They, like... They added the team.

84
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,600
Why couldn't they add the team and we can?

85
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,040
I feel like we should... I don't know.

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,100
We were gonna be Team Brain Cells.

87
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,220
Wow, you suck.

88
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,720
I was, like, trying to, like, add roles, but we don't have the proofs to add roles.

89
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,560
So, like...

90
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,100
I'm, like, a little... Okay.

91
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm also, like... I had two hours of sleep, guys.

92
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,440
So, like, I'm more... I'm more, like, frustrated.

93
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,780
You know, like, more frazzled up right now.

94
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,800
So, I was trying... We were trying to add the admins, but we can't add the admin roles.

95
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,920
And then, like... So, we were, like...

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,540
We had to individually add the mods and the admins to ask questions.

97
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,380
And I'm, like, I wish I could just add the roles.

98
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,240
It's so awkward.

99
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,620
It's definitely a little messy.

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,260
Yeah.

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
They're, like, please start your games.

102
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,940
We got help.

103
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,020
Oh, my God.

104
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,300
Who am I supposed to invite?

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,700
You're supposed to... The one I sent you.

106
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,820
The one I sent you.

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,860
That's a caster, though, is it not?

108
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,480
No, it's not.

109
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,020
That's... No, the one I sent you.

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,440
The UID.

111
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,220
That's not a caster.

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,980
That's the team... The captain.

113
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,980
They're level two.

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,400
What?

115
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,920
No, I sent you... I sent you a UID.

116
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,400
I sent you a UID.

117
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,300
No way.

118
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,880
Copy and paste the UID in the friends list.

120
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,440
You'll see.

121
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,640
They're level two.

122
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
There's no way.

123
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,600
Okay, wait.

124
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,640
Oh, my God.

125
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,940
This is awkward.

126
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,840
Wait, try... Oh, wait.

127
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,360
Do this.

128
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,040
Oh, they fucked up the... Okay, wait.

129
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,080
No, they fucked it up.

130
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,660
Okay, it's actually this.

131
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,180
And this one.

132
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,720
No, they, like... The order was different.

133
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,460
No, it's this one.

134
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,340
Oh.

135
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,620
Okay, now I can invite them.

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,460
Okay, thank God.

137
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,900
All right.

138
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,260
Fucking worried.

139
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,060
We did it.

140
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,960
Wait, how about maps?

141
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,600
The maps are... Oh, my God.

142
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,360
Where is it?

143
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,240
There's too many servers, guys.

144
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,800
There's too many... There's too many, like, announcements.

145
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,600
Which shadow was it?

146
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,480
They said the map.

147
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,080
I don't remember.

148
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,240
There's so many.

149
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,420
I'm looking as well.

150
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,740
Oh, Convergence.

151
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,620
Central Park.

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,620
I figured it out.

153
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,400
I found it.

154
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,480
It's in Grand Cup.

155
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,180
Guys, there's so many channels, guys.

156
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,700
There's a lot.

157
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,300
Convergence, Central Park.

158
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,580
Yeah.

159
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,000
Did anyone not look at the schedule before yesterday, by the way?

160
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,600
No, I looked at...

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,700
I didn't realize this was at 11 a.m.

162
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,760
Most of these are, like, you know, like, West Coast focused.

163
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,420
So, like, East Coast, I'm like... Yeah, I'm like, okay, I'll start this at, like, 4 a.m.

164
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,780
No, this is East Coast slash EU focused.

165
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,520
Oh, yuck.

166
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,880
I got baited, too, because I thought it was 11 a.m.

167
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,040
PT, so I was thinking this whole time, oh, damn, okay, I can get streaming, like, this entire weekend before.

168
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,960
And then, like, I realized, oh, shit, wait, that's, like, 8 a.m.

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,340
my time.

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,760
Okay, I guess I'm not streaming.

171
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah, no, it runs straight down my stream.

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
It's like, okay, never mind.

173
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Surprisingly, there's a lot of EU players in this tournament.

174
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,640
I think that's why it's, like, super early.

175
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,780
What is Central Park?

176
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,080
Yay, good for you, love.

177
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,420
You got the EU hours, finally.

178
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,540
I don't know about that.

179
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,060
I had to wake up earlier than I usually would for this.

180
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,820
Did you choose any time schedule at this point?

181
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,780
Yeah, pretty much.

182
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,060
When I was in LA for Anime Expo, that was more natural for me than life.

183
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,480
They're ready whenever, by the way.

184
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,260
Are you ready?

185
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,820
I'm ready.

186
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,180
Is it normal Vans?

187
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,820
Is it that?

188
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,120
Yes, it's the one we've been doing.

189
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,340
Okay, perfect.

190
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,060
Are you ready?

191
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,880
Are we ready?

192
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,720
Yeah, we're ready.

193
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,280
Okay, we're good.

194
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,340
Wait, wait, we didn't invite Beto.

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,160
Oh my god.

196
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,320
I mean, I invited him.

197
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,100
I fucking invited him.

198
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,260
Let's just fucking get him in.

199
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,280
Let's go.

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,380
We're gonna get in trouble for this.

201
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,100
Yeah, let's just go.

202
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,360
We'll just be like, we didn't know.

203
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,660
If they accuse Beto of stream sniping, we'll be like, really?

204
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,280
I'll be like, bro, what the fuck is Beto gonna do?

205
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,700
Careful, careful.

206
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,860
He might pick Magneto.

207
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:11,400
Dude, I did look at a little bit of their team, and they just have a Loki one trick and a Bucky one trick.

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,260
That's the scariest thing, and that's all.

209
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,300
Oh, they banned Strange.

210
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,560
Oh, wow, okay.

211
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,840
Let's just ban Bucky.

212
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,280
Fuck it.

213
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,600
If they have a Bucky one trick, we'll get rid of it.

214
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,320
Yeah, fuck them.

215
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,240
And we'll keep...

216
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,700
Beat that guy.

217
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,580
I don't know.

218
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,440
Luna, safer thing.

219
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,440
I think, like, just do Luna, just because, like, we don't really have anything we want to protect, to be honest.

220
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,240
They might protect Loki, maybe.

221
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,880
Yeah, fuck it.

222
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,520
Let them protect Loki.

223
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,700
Oh, Storm?

224
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,900
Storm, alright.

225
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,240
Alright, what should our next ban be?

226
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,480
Oh, the motherfuckers did the research.

227
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,680
I didn't do the research.

228
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,500
What about them?

229
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
I mean, I didn't research them.

230
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,100
I was not...

231
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,580
No, they're all private.

232
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,520
Let's just ban Loki.

233
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,300
Loki, right?

234
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,380
Loki one trick?

235
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:10,860
Yeah.

236
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,960
Okay, just ban Loki.

237
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,600
I mean, yeah, I have Namor open, so I'm fine.

238
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,080
Yeah, just ban it.

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,620
Oh, I need my glasses.

240
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,540
You weren't wearing glasses?

241
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,640
Yeah, I'm just chillin'.

242
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,720
You're gonna chill?

243
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,280
You don't take our tournament seriously.

244
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,240
With Slytherin, Ben, do you want me on Adam or Sue?

245
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,440
Adam.

246
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,640
Adam?

247
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:32,940
Alright.

248
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,800
Well, let's go Adam first.

249
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,380
Are we attacking or defending?

250
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,120
Oh, okay, we're attacking.

251
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,700
Yeah, it's fine.

252
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,940
We can swap if it doesn't work out.

253
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,380
So, they're probably gonna play Storm, so I guess if Loki doesn't have ult, we just do a soul bond and heal through it.

254
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:45,920
Yeah.

255
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll just sprint into everybody and be like, save me.

256
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,260
They'll be like, why am I here?

257
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,080
Oh, we're defending!

258
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,740
I can swap between Mag and Venom.

259
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,860
Yeah, we'll see how they're running.

260
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,960
See how it goes.

261
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,040
If I can fuck up their backlines, I'll probably swap to Venom.

262
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,520
Okay.

263
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,760
Alright, I'll give this to Coney.

264
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,160
Thank you!

265
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,260
Alright, let's see how this game goes.

266
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,900
We're gonna be playing safe.

267
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,140
Just wait for them to come around the corner.

268
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,720
Alright.

269
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,100
We can take just a lot of damage.

270
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,160
If I need to, if I get tired, I'll get gamer stuff soon.

271
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,700
Alright.

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,220
I don't know this map, like, at all, so...

273
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,660
What do you mean?

274
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,900
We've been scrimming on this map, Coney!

275
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,740
What the fuck do you mean?

276
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,500
They have the squirrel.

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,000
Doesn't mean I know it.

278
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,840
They have the squirrel.

279
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,700
Mag on the right as well.

280
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,440
Alright.

281
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,440
I can't heal you.

282
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:50,980
Okay.

283
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,820
They have Muna as well.

284
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,420
Muna and Stormwind.

285
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,100
Oh, their Stormwind is low.

286
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,820
I'm trying to kill Storm.

287
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,240
I have no shields, by the way.

288
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:01,440
No shields.

289
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,220
Okay.

290
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,320
Nice.

291
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,780
Alright, kill one, kill one, kill one.

292
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,300
Nice.

293
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,060
I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him.

294
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,380
I got Storm, I got Storm, I got Storm, I got Storm.

295
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,040
Huge.

296
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,860
I'm on their healer right now.

297
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,460
Squirrel's dead.

298
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,720
I can shield you up.

300
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,140
Go mess.

301
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,120
I'm just being... I'm just healing.

302
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,700
Just doing my thing.

303
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,900
I think I should get more than two hours of sleep.

304
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,260
Now, I know why people sleep.

305
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,920
Okay, guys.

306
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,320
After this team, I might make some...

307
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,640
Oh, shit.

308
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,620
Go, go, go.

309
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,480
Alright, alright, alright.

310
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:37,920
Okay, okay.

311
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,300
Oh, D.C.

312
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,280
D.C.?

313
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,860
Oh, shit.

314
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,500
How does that work?

315
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,620
Wait, who D.C.?

316
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,940
I mean, they're on attack, so we could, like, not...

317
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,340
We just chill.

318
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,440
We just pull back and chill, then.

319
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,960
I guess.

320
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,480
I don't know.

321
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,260
What was the D.C.

322
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,540
rules?

323
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,260
I don't remember.

324
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,520
I don't remember.

325
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,020
If it's before first kill, they'll remake.

326
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,600
If it's after first kill, it's just normal.

327
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,360
But, like, I'm down to remake.

328
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,880
Like, it just depends on time.

329
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,400
I don't care.

330
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,480
We'll just...

331
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,020
Okay.

332
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,180
Oh, okay.

333
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Alright, we'll just wait.

334
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh, okay.

335
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Okay, just there?

336
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,380
Okay, alright.

337
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:09,960
Alright, alright.

338
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,380
I'll take it.

339
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,100
I'll take it.

340
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,200
Alright.

341
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,200
Okay, alright.

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,280
Alright.

343
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,100
I think the obvious choice is to not remake.

344
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,140
Why did he ask if we want to?

345
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,020
You're the one...

346
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,340
Okay.

347
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,800
Okay.

348
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
Oh, my god.

349
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,820
Bro, okay, same bans.

350
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,480
Okay, that's good.

351
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,860
At least he lands at the same bans.

352
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,560
At least, you know.

353
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,600
Alright, let's just...

354
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,000
Alright.

355
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,640
Oh, my god.

356
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:35,820
Again.

357
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,580
Oh, my god.

358
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,160
First kill.

359
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:39,820
Again.

360
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,840
Come on, man.

361
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,180
Alright.

362
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,640
The least we could do is...

363
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,580
We've got a very strong team.

364
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:46,900
Okay.

365
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,760
No, I just say, like...

366
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,560
They didn't have to be like, should we remake?

367
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,740
Yeah, I don't know about all that.

368
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:56,980
Yeah.

369
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,980
I think after that, they're not allowed to have a second remake, right?

370
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:03,940
Yeah.

371
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,180
I don't know if Coney read the rule.

372
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,060
Yeah.

373
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,240
Coney did the research.

374
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,040
Holy shit, though.

375
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,300
I did, because my game keeps crashing.

376
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,180
So, if I...

377
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,540
Oh, okay.

378
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,160
Oh, shit.

379
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,260
I said that we don't have to...

380
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,380
They took our one remake.

381
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,920
What the...

382
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,640
We'll just be like...

383
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,020
What I'm gonna do is...

384
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,100
Oh, we used ours?

385
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,140
I'm gonna restart.

386
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,060
No, no.

387
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,840
They used theirs.

388
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,360
They used...

389
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,200
I think each team has a remake, right?

390
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,400
So, they used theirs.

391
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,740
So, then we should have our own remake.

392
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,600
Okay.

393
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,200
That's fine.

394
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,980
We'll just be like...

395
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,260
Lime.

396
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,000
Lime, move over.

397
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:32,700
Okay.

398
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,760
I was like, which button is it?

399
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,620
And then I saw the join button.

400
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,320
Yeah.

401
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,140
On its own.

402
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,440
Okay.

403
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,500
I am inviting Bettle in.

404
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,720
No, no.

405
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,480
Bettle can't watch.

406
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,540
Oh, he can't?

407
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,260
They kicked him out?

408
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,980
Yeah, they kicked him out.

409
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,920
Wait, who said that?

410
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,260
Look in our chat.

411
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,360
Wait, but he's not on the call.

412
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,000
Why is he not allowed to watch?

413
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I don't know.

414
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,060
He was told he couldn't?

415
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,560
What's he gonna do?

416
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,520
Talk to me.

417
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,480
What's this?

418
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,760
I guess he can just watch.

419
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,100
You're stuck to...

420
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
He's stuck to viewing our streams.

421
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,360
Oh, man.

422
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,680
I guess he has to watch the stream, yeah.

423
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,600
Yeah, he has to watch the stream.

424
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,920
I'm gonna start it right away.

425
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,420
You guys ready?

426
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:23,880
Yeah.

427
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm ready.

428
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,680
Let's get it.

429
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,280
Let's go.

430
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,240
Okay, I just asked them.

431
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,480
Okay, we asked R and I didn't wait.

432
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,960
They're scared of Bettle.

433
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
He's just so scary.

434
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,580
That was our caster, though.

435
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,540
Why are we doing this again?

436
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,460
What?

437
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,800
My bad.

438
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,860
Honestly, I might just go Bucky.

439
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,080
We banned Bucky, bro.

440
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,160
Yeah, we banned.

441
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,760
Yeah, because he had a Bucky and...

442
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,620
No, they said same ban, too.

443
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,620
I can't believe it.

444
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,460
Bettle has to be the scariest team member in our team.

445
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,610
Okay, which heroes will get my cosmic favor today?

446
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,860
Look how coney was like, you're in jail.

447
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,720
We put Bettle in jail.

448
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,420
He can't play.

449
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,880
Not allowed.

450
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,300
I can't believe they won't...

451
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,200
Like, I get it.

452
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,820
But like, come on, bro.

453
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,120
He's just a clown.

454
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,960
He can stream one of our streams.

455
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,820
He's just a little guy.

456
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,960
Yeah, he has to watch our streams like a fucking pleb.

457
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,940
Oh, dude.

458
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,660
Not that you guys are plebs, dear viewers.

459
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,660
Not that you guys.

460
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,620
Yeah, we're not talking about you guys.

461
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,740
Not you.

462
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,660
Not you.

463
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
Dude, I almost forgot that he would just pull up one of our streams.

464
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,400
Apparently he's scared of watching our streams because he doesn't want to get in trouble.

465
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,500
Because I was going to be like, hey, maybe I could just call you and like, FaceTime it.

466
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,840
Just FaceTime it.

467
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,180
Wait, that's stupid.

468
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,620
What am I talking about?

469
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,460
Just have your phone to your monitor and be like, Bettle, do you see this?

470
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,980
But then like, then you talk to yourself to his stream.

471
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Right, I forgot.

472
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,960
There's a lot of things that didn't get considered for that plan.

473
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,980
Appreciate the sentiment behind it.

474
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,840
It's just like, let me dox myself for Bettle real quick.

476
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,900
Alright, here we go again.

477
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,680
Wait, they're running a different character now.

478
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,860
They changed up their comp.

479
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,960
They changed up the comp, bro.

480
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,240
Oh, did they?

481
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
No, they did.

482
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,500
No, no, no.

483
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,020
Oh, me?

484
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,120
I have no shields, Coney, careful.

485
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm fine, I'm fine.

486
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,500
I'm healing it.

487
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,180
What is this?

488
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,460
Shields in 5, shields in 5.

489
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,240
Okay.

490
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,040
I see you, Foggy.

491
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,780
I have to reload.

492
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,920
There's a rocket on you guys.

493
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here.

494
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,540
Okay, I'm reloading.

495
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,900
Oh shit.

496
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,140
Help Jay, help Jay.

497
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,780
I have no shields, I have no... I'm good.

498
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,700
Yeah, no bubble, no bubble.

499
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,760
Bubble in 8.

500
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,580
I have ult here, but I'm going to save it for aggressive ults.

501
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,280
I mean, defensive ults.

502
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah, I have bubble in 1.

503
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,660
Spider-Man on you, Gomez!

504
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,300
This might be the first game on.

505
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,200
Okay, this might be the first game on.

506
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,740
Oh, I got him, I got him, I got him.

507
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,080
Good trick, good trick, good trick.

508
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,260
I'm going to Sly Locka.

509
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,040
One more comfort.

510
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,820
I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning.

511
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,200
I am ready to run.

512
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,240
How did that...

513
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,800
I have bubble for you.

514
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,080
I got Jay, I got Jay, I got Jay.

515
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,300
Oh no, oh no.

516
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,940
I can block it, maybe.

517
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,120
I got it, I got it, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

518
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,100
Nice ult bomb, nice ult bomb.

519
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,060
Nice.

520
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:16,980
Good shit.

521
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,020
Good name or shit.

522
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

523
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,680
Pudge him, pudge him, pudge him.

524
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,120
Get him, get him, get him, get him.

525
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,380
Oh, I got him.

526
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,340
We got him!

527
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,600
Damn it.

528
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,800
That's fucking right.

529
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,860
This is for Bettle.

530
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,580
He might not be able to see this, but it's for you, Bettle.

531
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
You can watch the recordings afterwards.

532
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,680
We'll give him the replay.

534
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,540
We'll give him the replay code and we'll watch this later.

535
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,180
You see that?

536
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,000
That was plural.

537
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,860
That was for you.

538
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,460
Yeah, yeah.

539
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,340
That was all for you, Bettle.

540
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,040
I'm good.

541
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:57,840
Yeah, bro.

542
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,440
Bro, you're chilling, man.

543
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,800
You're chilling.

544
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm fine.

545
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,280
Bubble in seven.

546
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,020
Careful there.

547
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:02,800
Seven.

548
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,940
Oh, you guys are so healthy.

549
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,840
I mean, they're not really pushing up.

550
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,680
I'm just going in.

551
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,720
Yeah, you're just going in, beating them up.

552
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,180
I might need heals.

553
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,760
I might need heals.

554
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,720
Back, back, back.

555
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,520
Can you stab me here?

556
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:14,880
Thank you.

557
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,580
Oh my goodness.

558
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,660
I have no bubble for the bubble.

559
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,340
I used my bubble.

560
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm good.

561
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,800
Oh, I'm backing up.

562
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:20,800
All right.

563
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,660
I have my ult, yeah.

564
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,680
I have ult again.

565
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:24,900
Oh, rocket.

566
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,220
Rocket.

567
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,760
Yeah, I'm with your rocket.

568
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,100
Is bubble down, huh?

569
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,400
It's almost dead.

570
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,900
Oh, I'm on.

571
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,680
Oh, shit.

572
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:30,860
I got you.

573
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,280
Spidey.

574
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,400
I'm back.

575
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,420
Spawned in it.

576
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,020
Whoa, we're all healthy.

577
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,380
We're all...

578
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,120
Oh my god.

579
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,460
We're less healthy now.

580
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,940
You might have to get ready for one more.

581
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,640
Oh, shit.

582
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,200
I just might have to get ready.

583
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:46,720
I think it's cool.

584
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,380
Yeah.

585
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,380
You're slamming.

586
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,840
You're clobbering.

587
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,620
Big clobber.

588
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:50,960
Big clobber.

589
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,340
Good clobber.

590
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
But I am not healthy.

591
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,480
Nice, nice, nice.

592
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,160
Oh, shit.

593
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,880
Spidey found me.

594
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,520
Spidey found me.

595
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,360
I got it off, but Spidey found me.

596
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,680
I'm frozen.

597
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,320
I'm roofing the shop.

598
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,740
I got Spidey.

599
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,360
I got Spidey.

600
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,560
We gotta eat somebody.

601
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,620
Okay, good shit.

602
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,320
It's a warm-up.

603
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,060
It's a warm-up.

604
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,960
It's a warm-up.

605
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,800
It's a warm-up, baby.

606
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,000
This is not looking good for you.

607
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,340
It's a warm-up.

608
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,760
First game.

609
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,660
Damn.

610
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,780
What happened?

611
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,180
Ready, Wash?

612
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,480
Spiderman?

613
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,480
Yo, bro, what the hell is he doing?

614
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,800
Bro, what's going on, bro?

615
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,640
I was like, alright, let me go up there and hug him.

616
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,160
Wait, what?

617
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,660
Wait, I think he's lost.

618
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,040
He's been in really weird places all game.

619
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:41,560
Yeah.

620
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,980
He sneaked in, bro.

621
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,560
Yeah, he's being a sneaky little guy.

622
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Nice one.

623
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,460
Alright.

624
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,660
Nice, alright.

625
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,400
Nice.

626
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,620
Nice.

627
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,640
Zero.

628
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,640
Time to switch things up.

629
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,700
Including which side you're on.

630
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,100
Damn.

631
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,000
Alright.

632
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,780
We're gonna play for attack.

633
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,680
I'm Luna Snow.

634
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,740
Same.

635
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,540
Actually, yeah.

636
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,580
I'm okay with doing this.

637
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll try and flank.

638
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:08,940
Hello.

639
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,740
Oh, he's on Psylocke, though.

640
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,520
So, we'll both do it.

641
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,960
I have him on Psylocke.

642
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm gonna do whatever.

643
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,280
Oh, you know what?

644
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,940
I could just bully the tank if I wanted to.

645
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,840
Yeah, let's just do that.

646
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,480
I'll put the orb on.

647
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,280
Yeah, you'll get ult-charged.

648
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,600
You'll get your ult-charged faster.

649
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,480
And then you just go around.

650
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,560
I'll put the orb on...

651
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,160
I'll put the orb on Gomez.

652
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,840
I need...

653
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,260
I need Coney to just throw me around.

654
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,780
Oh, yeah!

655
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,880
Let's get it!

656
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,480
Oh, yeah!

657
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm throwing you off the map, bro.

658
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,840
No!

659
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,000
Where's the fireplace, bro?

660
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,220
You're fucking lucky there's no fireplace in here.

661
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm taking you to bed, bro.

662
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,620
We're going to bed.

663
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,340
What?

664
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,620
I'm watching you.

665
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,180
Good night.

666
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,820
It's all watch, guys.

667
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,440
It's all watch.

668
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,680
Oh, look at that.

669
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,160
No, where'd he go?

670
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,460
Coney, where are you?

671
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,620
In the bed, Coney.

672
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:52,920
What happened?

673
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,760
Coney, come on.

674
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,040
He was waiting for you.

675
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,360
He was waiting for you.

676
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,640
The entire team watching.

677
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,380
Alright, I'm going to throw you and then I'm going to E to you and we're just going to kill the whole backline.

678
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:12,940
Oh, yeah.

679
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,200
And then we get the point.

680
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,560
That sounds so simple.

681
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,580
Where the hell is the... I don't understand this.

682
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,620
Alright, we're going around the corner.

683
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm full sending.

684
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,780
Alright, go, go.

685
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
Alright, let's get it.

686
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,400
Oh, my God.

687
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,700
I got one, I got one, I got one.

688
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:34,940
Oh, my God.

689
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,580
Wait, you guys killed somebody?

690
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,700
Cloak half, cloak half.

691
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,520
Okay, we're all fine.

692
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,680
We're all still healthy, guys.

693
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,540
I don't know what the fuck happened, but you guys are awesome.

694
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,020
We're all healthy.

695
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,000
That's all that matters.

696
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,560
I got Hela.

697
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,160
Hela's dead.

698
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:49,980
Okay.

699
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,040
Alright, nice.

700
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,460
We did it.

701
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,300
What happened?

702
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,760
She was standing way forward.

703
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,020
I hit her with half of my right click and then Wolverine jumped on her.

704
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,240
I picked Wolverine literally one shot.

705
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,960
I threw Wolverine at somebody's face and they died.

706
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,100
She was at half because I hit her with my right click.

707
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,300
Oh, my God.

708
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,940
You fucked that poor guy.

709
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,260
That poor 30k heal.

710
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,180
Jesus Christ, that was such a short game and I still got 30k healing.

711
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,260
You did 30k?

712
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,320
What the fuck?

713
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,480
Yeah, Coney was feeding hard, you can tell.

714
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,180
Alright, let's get beddled in here.

715
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,420
Alright.

716
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,700
Alright, goodbye, Jay.

717
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,080
Oh, my God.

718
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,060
Goodbye.

719
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,000
You can't spectate.

720
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,260
Get out of here.

721
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah, get out, Jay.

722
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,300
Yeah, get out.

723
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,980
Learn our strats, Jay.

724
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,360
Yeah.

725
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,420
Yeah, Jay.

726
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,100
We don't want you to cheat.

727
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,380
Oh, wait.

728
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:49,880
He's gone.

729
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,680
Beddle, get in here.

730
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,920
Welcome back, Beddle.

731
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,920
Alright, how did we do?

732
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,420
Oh, we lost.

733
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,620
We did pretty good.

734
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,740
We lost the first match, but you're here to make sure we win the next one, right?

735
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,260
Yeah, that's me.

736
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,620
Yeah, don't worry.

737
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,740
That would be a shame if we lost.

738
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,240
You tag me in and we lose.

739
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,940
What was their next map again?

740
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,460
I don't remember.

741
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,160
Okay, it's in the Grand Cup info.

742
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,020
It's Convoy Midtown.

743
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,520
Yeah, I got it.

744
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,480
Alright, cool.

745
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,780
I got the list pulled up.

746
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,600
Oh, nice.

747
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,540
Okay, so I don't have to tell you anything.

748
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,740
Nah, nah, nah.

749
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,900
They let Beddle out of jail?

750
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,920
Okay, welcome back.

751
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,260
Come here.

752
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,620
Hi, Beddle.

753
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,520
Welcome back, Beddle.

754
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,280
Beddle, are you ready?

755
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,880
Have you thought about your sins and crimes?

756
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,940
You paid your dues to society.

757
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,260
Yeah.

758
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,780
They let me back out into the city.

759
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,460
Yeah, you're on probation right now.

760
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,440
One wrong move and you're going back to jail.

761
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,660
Surely they won't ban Mag, right?

762
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,440
They won't do research on Beddle, right?

763
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:01,740
No.

764
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Surely not.

765
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,020
Surely not.

766
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,420
They let Jay play Mag.

767
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,140
Did you just say fuck Bucky again?

768
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,240
Yeah, just fuck Bucky.

769
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:11,740
Yeah.

770
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,300
Oh, they don't know!

771
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,020
They don't know we have zero strange players!

772
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,140
Do we protect Mag?

773
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah, just protect Mag.

774
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,940
I mean, this is our last game against this team.

775
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Protect Starlord?

776
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,800
Oh, wait, Starlord!

777
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,200
Wait, wait, protect Starlord.

778
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,260
Protect Starlord.

780
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:28,940
Let him do it.

781
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,120
Okay, okay.

782
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
How would they know?

784
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,340
How would they know?

785
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,740
If they ban Mag or Gavus here, they'll got a tank.

786
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,140
Well...

787
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,780
That's why I said it.

788
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,420
Oh, okay.

789
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,500
Don't worry.

790
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,860
We're taking that risk.

791
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,260
You're gonna see my first time Groot in the middle of the game.

792
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,680
This is the risk we're willing to take.

793
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,620
There's no way.

794
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,680
I'd rather just ban Luna.

795
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,580
They aren't familiar with our...

796
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:57,980
Exactly.

797
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,820
They're not familiar.

798
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,140
How would they know?

799
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,180
Unless they pull up one of our...

800
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,600
Oh, see?

801
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,580
Yeah, you know what?

802
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,100
There we go.

803
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,960
They just ban Luna.

804
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,640
That's fine.

805
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,280
Luna's dead.

806
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,260
What was it?

807
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:09,840
Loki, right?

808
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,560
Yeah, we could do Loki.

809
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,140
Unless you wanna play it or like...

810
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,260
No, we play...

811
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,860
We can play...

812
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,380
Ban Loki and we'll do Adam Su.

813
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,060
Adam Su.

814
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,380
Okay.

815
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,370
Alright, let's do it.

816
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,490
Alright, I'll do Adam and then you run Su.

817
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,330
Let's get it.

818
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,170
Well, we kept Hela safe.

819
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:35,870
Yeah.

820
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:36,830
Okay.

821
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,880
Alright, convoy time.

822
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,460
I'm ready.

823
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,040
I'm so ready.

824
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,400
I've been ready.

825
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,800
I have like four or five hours of sleep.

826
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,680
You know, I didn't even ask.

827
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,680
He had more sleep than me.

828
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,500
That's what I wanna hear.

829
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,480
I'm drinking gamer subs after this match, that's for sure.

830
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,680
I realized, like...

831
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
I was like, I can...

832
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,900
You know, like when you hit the...

833
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,440
I thought that would hit the peak where like...

834
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,520
You're tired.

835
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,440
You're so tired that you have so much energy.

836
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,760
But like, I'm not at that stage right now.

837
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,420
I'm definitely not at that stage.

838
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,160
You relied on the second wind, you fool.

839
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,920
Yeah, I thought I had the second wind.

840
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,240
And then I looked at him, I was like, my eyes are tired.

841
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,280
I was like, oh fuck.

842
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,860
My eyes are tired.

843
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,840
It's okay, you don't have to focus for like another four hours.

844
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,360
You'll be fine.

845
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,560
Yeah, we just have to go for...

846
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,020
We have to play five other teams.

847
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,760
You'll be fine.

848
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

849
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,020
It'll be so okay.

850
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,700
Alright, I have Beto's volume, so...

851
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,880
How many games is it per team?

852
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,500
It's two matches per team.

853
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,200
Yeah.

854
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,260
Yeah.

855
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,400
Okay.

856
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,540
That's Spiderman.

857
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,320
Um, I don't know, man.

858
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,120
Okay.

859
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
I'm the captain, but I don't know.

860
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:53,700
Yeah.

861
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,760
There's really nothing for my character to do here.

862
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,700
I'm just chillin'.

863
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,200
Hey, Penny!

864
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,700
Yeah, I do.

865
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,440
You know, they're trying to anti-dive.

866
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,080
I'm low.

867
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,980
I'm assuming that Limeo is healing you guys.

868
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,160
Heal.

869
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,120
Whoa!

870
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,620
I need to heal myself.

871
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,100
Don't look at you!

872
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:15,620
Whoa!

873
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,600
Okay, I've dropped down, Lime.

874
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:18,960
Yeah, I'm down, I'm down.

875
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,340
What hit you?

876
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,140
I don't know.

877
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,280
That's the one thing I don't like, is Penny against thing, because I just get fucking netted over and over.

878
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,500
So, that's what I'm worried about, but...

879
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,960
Wait, Spidey.

880
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,420
I got him.

881
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:30,960
He's right there.

882
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:31,560
Okay.

883
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:32,900
Is he low?

884
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:33,960
Nah.

885
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,520
I did hit him once.

886
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,040
I hit him once.

887
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,020
Oh yeah.

888
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,880
Oh, he got shielded.

889
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,800
Oh, I could've killed him.

890
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,420
Yeah, I was trying to shoot him too.

891
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,240
On top, Hella on top.

892
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,440
Alright, I'll go for the Hella.

893
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,540
Oh my god, I almost got her head.

894
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,740
I'm flying away.

895
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,080
Okay.

896
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,420
Can you heal?

897
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Can you heal?

898
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,080
I don't have snaps, I don't have snaps.

899
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,540
I got it.

900
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,820
You, like, flew the moment I snapped.

901
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,660
I'm gonna try to break the...

902
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,520
It's right there.

903
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,020
I see it.

904
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,020
Yeah, I'm breaking it, I'm breaking it right now.

905
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,480
It's broken.

906
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,500
Coney, give me...

907
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:07,900
Oh, wait, no.

908
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,860
Nevermind, you're on point.

909
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,860
Okay, I have...

910
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,240
Oh, shoot.

911
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,780
They're gonna have Spider-Man ult here.

912
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,260
Do you want me to ult it though, Gabe?

913
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,140
Um, I just ult on it first.

914
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,040
Okay.

915
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,660
I got Claw up.

916
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,420
I'm gonna ult.

917
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,780
Yeah, fuck this.

918
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,300
Fuck that one guy in particular.

919
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,760
There's two?

920
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,460
I thought you would pop defense ult.

921
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,040
I popped...

922
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah, I didn't pop any defensive ult for that.

923
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,420
He popped zero ults, by the way.

924
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,600
So, we should use nothing.

925
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,380
Alright, let's clear.

926
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,760
Good job, good job.

927
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,840
Um, the Spider-Man is most likely trying to scout me out for a rez.

928
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,780
So, that's gonna be an issue.

929
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,340
He did run me down when I rezzed you the last time.

930
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:45,760
Yeah, yeah.

931
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,440
I think that he's just gonna be trying to find me.

932
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:47,960
Oh, he's low, he's low.

933
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,720
Oh my god, bro.

934
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,520
Get the fuck back here.

935
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,380
Are you guys okay?

936
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,080
Where did he go?

937
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,560
There he is!

938
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,700
I'm chasing him.

939
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,840
Get him, boys!

940
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,020
After him!

941
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,740
Get him, boys!

942
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,940
Crush that Spider-Man!

943
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,620
I want pictures of Spider-Man right now!

944
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,280
I want pictures of Spider-Man!

945
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,480
I have ult after this.

946
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,880
Good shit.

947
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,060
You're fine!

948
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,960
You're so healthy.

949
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,500
I don't know... oh yeah, he's healthy too.

950
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,500
I'm so low, I'm so low.

951
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,080
I'm so low.

952
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,080
I'm so low!

953
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,080
Oh, you have regen.

954
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,720
I'm dead.

955
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,120
Okay, I'm gonna...

956
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,360
Oh shit, they're all here.

957
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,140
Make sure I'm alive.

958
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,380
Actually, actually, big rez.

959
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,060
Am I in this?

960
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,800
Yes, you are.

961
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,200
You might have to use ult for this.

962
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,780
Oh, okay.

963
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,040
Sorry, I should have said use ult the moment they rez.

964
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,640
I shouldn't have messed with the amazing Spider-Man.

965
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,940
That's on me.

966
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,880
That's my bad.

967
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,440
I don't have soulbond for this.

968
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,840
I have clobber.

969
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,760
Oh, bro, I got bullied there.

970
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,260
Damn it.

971
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,060
That's fine.

972
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,080
I have clobber, you got nothing up.

973
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I have soulbond, I have soulbond.

974
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,700
I might soulbond in it.

975
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,020
Alright, I'm here.

976
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,240
Hold on.

977
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:57,680
Shit.

978
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,960
I got separated!

979
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,420
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you!

980
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,420
I soulbonded, I soulbonded.

981
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,900
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

982
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,380
Alright, I got Q for this.

983
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,000
Pushing up.

984
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm touching, I'm touching, I'm touching.

985
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,580
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

986
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,120
Alright, go, go, go.

987
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,800
Oh my god, huge!

988
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,500
It's huge!

989
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,060
Go, go, go, go!

990
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,120
It always is!

991
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,160
Oh my god, it's huge!

992
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Oh, my ults are huge!

993
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:18,980
Nice.

994
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,300
Alright, good shit.

995
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:20,800
Nice, nice.

996
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,240
Oh, hey, there's Spider-Man.

997
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,400
Get his pictures right now.

998
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:23,820
Dox him.

999
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,800
Oh my god, he's so good.

1000
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,860
He's a menace.

1001
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,800
He's a menace to society.

1002
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,980
Dox him right now.

1003
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,400
He's gonna touch her.

1004
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,640
Oh wait, true, he's gonna touch.

1005
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,360
He's not gonna touch.

1006
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,160
I can't wait till they add Jonah Jameson.

1007
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:38,840
I'm playing as him.

1008
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,800
He's gonna fucking do it.

1009
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,560
Hard counter Spider-Man.

1010
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,160
Get a hard counter.

1011
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,780
He doxes Spider-Man and he just removes him from the game.

1012
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,480
You have to go in hiding.

1013
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,220
Yeah, he just turns into Peter Parker.

1014
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,820
No character can steal you for the next 20 seconds.

1015
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,700
You just have to go hide in a room.

1016
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,920
I can't wait.

1017
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,500
Let me up Beto's volume a little bit more.

1018
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,360
Dude, I can up mine on my end if need be.

1019
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,400
No, it's alright.

1020
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,220
You were like at 100 earlier, so I have plenty of room to up you.

1021
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,520
I can't wait for Professor Xavier.

1022
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,420
To be a character.

1023
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,540
In his fucking wheelchair.

1024
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,140
There's a lot of stairs in this game.

1025
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,800
It's gonna be a hover wheelchair, okay guys?

1026
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,000
It's gonna be a hover wheelchair.

1027
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,440
Well, if it's just his skin though.

1028
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,480
He has different drip for his wheelchair.

1029
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:50,860
True.

1030
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,700
Oh my god.

1031
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,840
That'll be so fucking cool.

1032
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
He drips out his wheelchair.

1033
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,440
Depending on the skin.

1034
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,960
I just wanted to like...

1035
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,940
Cause he's gonna be a support.

1036
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,720
So I'm like, what the fuck is he gonna do?

1037
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,940
How is he gonna heal his teammates with mental power?

1038
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
I guess he has...

1039
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,780
It's morale.

1040
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,860
Yeah, like his encouragement.

1041
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,780
He makes you think you're okay.

1042
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,400
By controlling your like...

1043
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,540
Your one nine hulk player.

1044
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,380
You can do it.

1045
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,440
Positive reinforcement.

1046
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,060
You're not dying.

1047
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,200
Woah, woah, woah.

1048
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,060
This guy's gonna die.

1049
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,420
Oh my god, oh my god.

1050
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,900
Oh my god, I don't...

1051
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,640
Okay, I got your snap.

1052
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,840
I'm just gonna give you soul bond for this.

1053
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,420
Just cause like...

1054
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,740
Penny's one, Penny's one by the way.

1055
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,060
Yeah, yeah.

1056
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,640
Oh, he's getting healed, he's getting healed.

1057
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,840
Wait, why are you Iron Fist?

1058
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,560
Oh, I kinda felt like it.

1059
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,640
Come on.

1060
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,440
I think he could die.

1061
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,400
I got one.

1062
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,060
I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you.

1063
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,200
Solo healer, by the way.

1064
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,180
Woah, I got picked off.

1065
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,820
I'm getting fucking punched.

1066
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,520
It's fine, Adam's an amazing solo healer.

1067
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,780
Yeah, I was gonna say, I am solo healing right now.

1068
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,860
I got got there.

1069
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,740
Get that hulk, he's one.

1070
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,320
I'm surprised by how long I survived as a solo healer.

1071
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,140
What if I just ult in front of everybody?

1072
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,540
Actually, nothing would go wrong.

1073
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,420
Okay.

1074
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,980
I'm gonna hold my ult for a long time so I can...

1075
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,760
Bro is meditating.

1076
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,120
So I can ult after line ult.

1077
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,900
Keep going, Coney.

1078
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,300
Holy shit.

1079
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,440
Keep going?

1080
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,580
Yeah, keep going.

1081
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,380
Keep punching him.

1082
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,820
Keep going?

1083
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,000
Keep fucking punching.

1084
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:39,700
Okay.

1085
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,940
There's a magneto on us.

1086
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,020
There's a magneto here.

1087
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,260
We got him.

1088
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,360
Nice.

1089
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,220
We did it.

1090
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,380
Nice, huge.

1091
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,820
Nice, we did it.

1092
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,240
Yay, we're going with the first game.

1093
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,700
Okay.

1094
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,320
GG.

1095
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,740
We're going back to bench.

1096
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,960
That's like a hair.

1097
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:01,900
Okay.

1098
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,340
Yay.

1099
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,880
When does the next round start?

1100
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,600
I don't even know.

1101
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,700
Wait, let me look at the schedule.

1102
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,800
We need to know if the other team is done playing too.

1103
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,560
I'm gonna look at the challenge so we can tell if they're done.

1104
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,280
Because I don't even...

1105
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,160
Oh yeah, we have to report our games.

1106
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,720
Bro, battle damage.

1107
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,200
Wait.

1108
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:19,840
Damn.

1109
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,280
Wait, let me see.

1110
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,320
Oh my god.

1111
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,120
Oh my god.

1112
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,360
You got blocked by the snake.

1113
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,340
That was our secret weapon.

1114
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,680
Wait, you did more than me.

1115
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,740
Yeah, you did more than...

1116
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,220
You know what?

1117
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,980
Maybe battle should replace you.

1118
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,720
I did not expect you to do more damage than us.

1119
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,100
Please do not tell my team this.

1120
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,880
Don't worry.

1121
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,020
I'll tell his team this.

1122
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,700
Alright, how do I report our fucking games?

1123
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,680
I'm learning this as we go along, guys.

1124
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,020
Where the fuck...

1125
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,640
Oh, group A.

1126
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,240
Also, Jay found out that you can't actually watch the stream, so that's nice.

1127
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,500
You can?

1128
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1129
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,560
So Benno, you can watch the stream.

1130
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,540
You can't spectate, but you can...

1131
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,000
I'll watch from afar.

1132
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,480
Someone in my chat said Gomez used the morale skill on Coney and they killed everyone.

1133
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,040
Gomez definitely popped his ult.

1134
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,440
He told me to fight, and we did.

1135
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,200
We killed him.

1136
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,500
Oh wait, okay.

1137
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:19,560
I'm gonna open up Coney's stream because we're supposed to post screenshots of us winning the rounds, but I forgot to...

1138
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,380
I can't rewind.

1139
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,900
You're using Toad as your...

1140
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,080
Yeah, what do you think?

1141
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,160
Do you like it?

1142
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,700
It's cute.

1143
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,500
Toad is here.

1144
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,500
Hey, stay on my stream for a second.

1145
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,580
Hey, Donkey fans.

1146
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,780
Hey, come over here and drop that rhyme, huh?

1147
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,460
Wait, Coney doesn't have past broadcasts.

1148
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,600
How the fuck am I gonna...

1149
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,620
Coney, you don't have...

1150
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,860
Oh yeah, I don't have broadcasts on because I dox myself a lot.

1151
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,340
God damn it.

1152
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,260
We forgot to take screenshots, but we...

1153
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,900
Oh no, just take screenshots of the...

1154
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,680
Yeah, we're supposed to just take screenshots.

1155
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,360
I don't have rewind on my stream.

1156
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,520
I'll just say that.

1157
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,240
Do you want me to...

1158
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,420
I can put the screenshot in here.

1159
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,300
Oh, you have it?

1160
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,340
Wait, okay.

1161
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,680
It's of the history here.

1162
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,300
Oh, okay.

1163
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,480
Okay, here we go.

1164
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,180
We have...

1165
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,900
Okay, that...

1166
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,780
You are so smart.

1167
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,360
I'm so...

1168
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,060
I think my tired brain is like nuts.

1169
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,200
We have this.

1170
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,520
I'm gonna send these two just to make sure.

1171
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,260
That's probably more comprehensive, yeah.

1172
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,080
Let's use those.

1173
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,820
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1174
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,180
We'll just use these.

1175
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,340
All right, you guys are so much smarter.

1176
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,200
I think it's because my brain is way too tired.

1177
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,780
I was like, wait, I have...

1178
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,940
I can look at my history.

1179
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,960
There's no way to track history unless someone's streaming.

1180
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,780
What the fuck?

1181
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,740
I'm not okay right now.

1182
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,960
Tony, whenever I think of Toad, I just think of this tweet.

1183
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,360
Hold on.

1184
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,740
Click that real quick and just read everything.

1185
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:51,780
Hold on.

1186
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,270
Oh boy.

1187
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,750
Wait, what is this tweet?

1188
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,270
Are you a participant of that?

1189
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,170
No, I'm the green one, by the way.

1190
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,490
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1191
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,650
Oh, you're not the purple one?

1192
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,750
No, I'm not the purple one.

1193
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,250
I'm the green one.

1194
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,730
I love my fellow Toads, and that's as far as it goes.

1195
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:20,410
Okay.

1196
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,350
What?

1197
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,130
What, you don't like the purple Toad?

1198
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,970
I just noticed the purple one.

1199
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,590
What's wrong with the purple Toad?

1200
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,410
What's wrong?

1201
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,170
Are you judging him?

1202
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,270
Are you shaming the purple Toad?

1203
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,430
I'm not going to stand for purple slander in here.

1204
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,970
Did you even read the tweet, Beto?

1205
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,430
Beto, did you even read the tweet?

1206
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,910
Read each dialogue for us on stream.

1207
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,730
Yeah, read it.

1208
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,510
It's in the Rocket Raccoon.

1209
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,230
Yeah.

1210
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,150
Oh, I thought we were just talking about Toad colors.

1211
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,010
No, no, no, read the tweet, Beto.

1212
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,710
Read the tweet.

1213
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,210
Oh, thank God I did it just about the first time.

1214
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,350
Purple what?

1215
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,130
That's not purple.

1216
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,090
That's a Zark.

1217
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,990
Oh, no, we all acknowledge it was purple.

1218
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,190
It's a purple that just says, me too.

1219
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,970
No, no, read more, read more, read more.

1220
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:15,570
Read more, read more.

1221
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,070
I'm not reading these.

1222
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,330
No, read it.

1223
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,550
Read it, come on.

1224
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,390
You're just so curious.

1225
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,130
What's wrong?

1226
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,930
What's wrong with the purple?

1227
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,450
I thought you loved purple, Beto.

1228
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,430
I gotta lose Nintendo perms, I can't.

1229
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,050
Oh, so you don't love purple.

1230
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,730
I do love purple.

1231
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,950
You don't love purple.

1232
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,610
Purple's my favorite color, just not in this context.

1233
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,650
So you're shaming him.

1234
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,230
Shaming the purple Toad.

1235
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,410
I tried vouching, I'm backing out.

1236
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,510
Not loyal.

1237
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,070
He's not loyal.

1238
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,830
I'm gonna make gamer subs real quick, guys, I'll be right back.

1239
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:54,850
Okay.

1240
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,430
Do I leave?

1241
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,730
I'm so ready to leave.

1242
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,010
You just don't want to be here anymore.

1243
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,850
I'm ready to go.

1244
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,280
Wait, can we know when we get to play?

1245
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,160
I think we added.

1246
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,360
I have no idea, is it like when the next team's done?

1247
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,540
How do we know when the next team's done?

1248
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,420
That we fight?

1249
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,920
I don't know, this is gonna cause complications if it's not starting by the time that was scheduled.

1250
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,320
Ah, I see.

1251
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,840
So it should have started already?

1252
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,960
Yeah, okay.

1253
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,340
Let me check first.

1254
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,800
Yeah, check with them, check with them.

1255
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,520
Because we're kind of running late right now, right?

1256
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,120
Yeah, because we have to remake.

1257
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,060
Oh, the remake was what did it, right?

1258
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,500
I forgot.

1259
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,580
Okay, we're supposed to start...

1260
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,820
No, okay, we're on schedule.

1261
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,800
Oh, we're on schedule?

1262
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,220
Okay.

1263
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,420
Ten minutes.

1264
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,880
Ten minutes, we start the next one.

1265
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,960
I think they baked in time, because there's gonna be stuff like this a lot, I think.

1266
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,440
Oh, yeah.

1267
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,640
Okay, so there's four matches.

1268
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,030
Hmm, okay, okay.

1269
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,330
Oh, five matches.

1270
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:13,890
Yeah.

1271
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,950
Yeah, we play every other person in our group.

1272
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,090
Ten minute losers' round.

1273
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,770
Oh, okay, so that's if we're losers.

1274
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:29,250
Yeah, I think if we're not in the losers' round, then we finish at like three-ish.

1275
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,130
That sounds terrible.

1276
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,610
I need us to finish at three, by the way.

1277
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,730
Okay, what if we lose, though?

1278
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,630
Then my team will be pissed at me, because I'm in a tournament right after this.

1279
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,730
I'm back.

1280
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,790
We definitely finished our games.

1281
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,750
We finished our games way too fast.

1282
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,950
We're the only team that finished both our matches.

1283
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,570
Did we?

1284
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,790
Yeah, I'm looking at the challenge.

1285
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,370
We're the only ones that reported 2-0.

1286
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,390
Our match was kind of fast, yeah.

1287
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,010
Oh, wait, no, one team already finished.

1288
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:04,890
Oh, okay.

1289
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:14,550
So, okay, so the team that I said that I felt was like the hardest team also just finished their two matches.

1290
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,570
Okay, good.

1291
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,030
So, like, are they the only ones?

1292
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,210
Round one, match two, okay.

1293
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,990
So, Kultus, Oni...

1294
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,450
Oh, yeah, Kultus and Oni.

1295
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,610
Are what seem to be like the hard ones.

1296
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,930
Because they both finished it.

1297
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,710
The Oni inmates are the ones with the Venom and Spider.

1298
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,450
Spider mains.

1299
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,350
They also have a Wolverine player.

1300
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,740
Let me wolf against them.

1301
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,010
Let's see, I looked at what game they won.

1302
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:58,750
The game they won, they went Cloak, Luna, Moon Knight, Magic.

1303
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,170
Oh, so they have a Magic player.

1304
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,870
I think that's their...

1305
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,950
Yeah, Magic.

1306
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,490
Oh, no, this is the wrong one.

1307
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,150
This is the Maidens.

1308
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,710
Okay, let me look at the Oni.

1309
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:15,090
Okay, they went Wolverine, Rocket, Luna, Bucky, Punisher, Groot.

1310
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,130
In their second round, they went Hawk.

1311
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,790
I think in the second round, they just fucked around.

1312
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,510
Because it's like Thor...

1313
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,430
Yeah, it's Thor, Captain America, Storm, Hawkeye.

1314
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,250
So I think in the second round, they just fucked around.

1315
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,010
Because that's a weird lineup.

1316
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,250
Oh, Boger is casting the tournament?

1317
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,310
Yeah, he is casting.

1318
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:43,910
Oh.

1319
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,750
Holy, I didn't know that.

1320
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:52,710
Guys, if we win the tournament, we get...

1321
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,570
What was it?

1322
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:56,570
$200 worth of Marvel Rival skins to you guys.

1323
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:57,150
Whoa.

1324
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,630
We don't have to spend money on skins ever again.

1325
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,030
I already got a lot from the... Was it the other tourney?

1326
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,110
Oh, yeah, the Toast one.

1327
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,190
Yeah, the Toast one.

1328
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:13,850
For second place.

1329
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,270
What did you get for it?

1330
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,670
For second place, the winners got all the skins that they wanted, right?

1331
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:20,130
Yeah.

1332
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,290
I think second place got just a bunch of blue creds.

1333
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,910
How much credits did you get?

1334
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,530
I don't... I think it was like $10,000 or something.

1335
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,030
That's a lot.

1336
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,270
It was a good amount, so I was happy with it.

1337
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,610
This one is like... Whoa, shit, sorry.

1338
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,870
This one is like $24,000.

1339
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,610
We were kind of joking about consolation prize, but they actually did.

1340
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,650
Oh, that's nice of them.

1341
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:48,370
I'm still not over Nekros trolling and grabbing me and Sykkuno for his team.

1342
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,370
I don't know what that was.

1343
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,770
I mean, it was for content.

1344
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,890
It was for content.

1345
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,110
Because Volker got... What was it?

1346
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,730
He got Jon and Dany.

1347
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,010
Yeah, he got Jon on Thor, and then you're like, what the fuck did you do again?

1348
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:02,830
Against Jon's Thor.

1349
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:08,410
Literally, the only thing I could do against Jon's Thor was just freezing him 24-7.

1350
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,250
His Thor is actually insane.

1351
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:10,710
Yeah.

1352
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,170
I don't know.

1353
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,050
Flanking Thor when they know how to do it is scary.

1354
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:22,210
Especially in randomized teams too, because you don't have enough time to coordinate yourself with your team to fucking...

1355
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,190
Dude, are we talking about the toast tournament?

1356
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,150
Yeah, yeah, when Jon was on Thor.

1357
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,610
It pissed me off.

1358
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,170
I had to win one more game.

1359
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,690
I was on your team, Kony.

1360
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:34,750
No, no, no.

1361
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,970
Even before that, I'm in the last game, right?

1362
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:42,090
In the last game, I had to win one more round, and then they target banned Fantastic.

1363
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,850
I could not believe it.

1364
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,910
I got fucking target banned, so I didn't get to the finals.

1365
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:48,910
Lost all my skins to Skara.

1366
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,630
Of course Skara would.

1367
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,730
Yeah, Skara played Penny Parker.

1368
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:58,970
So sad.

1369
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,090
Next time I'm playing Thing.

1370
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,390
It's just way easier.

1371
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,890
Yeah, you just hold right click, and then...

1372
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:09,310
Oh, fuck.

1373
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,550
It's clobbering time.

1374
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,110
Do I let Jay back in?

1375
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,350
Huh?

1376
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,170
Do I let Jay back in?

1377
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:18,910
I mean, we can, yeah.

1378
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:24,070
Since he's going next, he needs to rally his mind.

1379
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:25,870
Yeah, go for it.

1380
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,990
Yeah, go for it if you want to.

1381
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,610
Oh, you should figure out which streamer you're going to watch, Beto.

1382
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,930
I'll put up all three at once.

1383
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,170
All three at once?

1384
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:34,810
Damn.

1385
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,550
Damn, how many monitors does he have?

1386
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,770
I have two, and one barely works.

1387
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,630
I hope it's not the one where you're playing.

1388
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1389
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:46,730
I'm checking.

1390
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,990
Alright, bye-bye.

1391
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:49,890
Okay, bye-bye.

1392
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:50,410
Heck no!

1393
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:51,770
Put him away.

1394
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,950
I'm like waiting for... they haven't updated round two, so I have no idea who we're facing next.

1395
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:03,710
Welcome back, Jay.

1396
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:04,970
Oh, hello.

1397
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,010
Hi, Jay.

1398
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:07,350
Hello.

1399
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:10,050
I'm just trying to go check on my rats in the meantime.

1400
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,250
Yeah, big rat.

1401
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,570
I think big rat's my favorite.

1402
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,930
How are we supposed to select the next one?

1403
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,550
Funny, that's the one that likes me the most.

1404
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:23,830
He's the one who keeps nibbling my fingers and trying to bite me.

1405
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,530
I mean, that's the best name, though.

1406
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,030
Big rat?

1407
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,990
Yeah, I love that guy.

1408
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:29,610
Big rat.

1409
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:35,270
That's the only name I remember from all your rats.

1410
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,230
It's the most memorable.

1411
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,470
Big rat.

1412
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,810
Doki, can you check DMs?

1413
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:46,970
Oh, shit.

1414
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,110
Yeah, check DMs.

1415
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:48,750
Nice.

1416
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,090
Nice.

1417
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:54,750
Oh, boy.

1418
00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:03,290
Actually, not nice, because that means we might have to face the really hard team.

1419
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,910
And I hate playing that comp.

1420
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,590
Nah, we got it.

1421
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,550
We can't say what comp it is.

1422
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:14,610
We can't say it.

1423
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,750
What if we get stream sniped?

1424
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,710
It's gonna happen.

1425
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,170
No, they're gonna stream snipe for day two.

1426
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:23,810
They will.

1427
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:25,530
100%.

1428
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,070
But if we do face that team, then they already know what comp we're gonna play.

1429
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:34,110
I don't think they know how to play against it yet.

1430
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,340
Are you talking about the comp I'm thinking that you're talking about?

1431
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,260
Yeah, the comp that when we figured it out, we fucking...

1432
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,540
Oh, that one.

1433
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,300
The secret comp.

1434
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,820
The secret comp.

1435
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,300
Our emergency comp when nothing works.

1436
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,520
Yeah, when nothing works, we pull out the most cheap comp ever.

1437
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,290
But we can't say it because they might research us for day two.

1438
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,910
If we make it, we'll make it.

1439
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,850
I hope we make it to day two.

1440
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,690
Oh, I'm refreshing.

1441
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,750
We didn't even update our scores.

1442
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:18,550
Oh, no, they did.

1443
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,030
Never mind.

1444
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,890
There's still two more teams that are still fighting each other.

1445
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,450
So we're waiting for that.

1446
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,360
All right, chat.

1447
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,140
I muted myself, guys, so I can talk to you guys.

1448
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,880
I'm nervous.

1449
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,580
That's the reason why I didn't sleep that much.

1450
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,420
I literally couldn't go to sleep.

1451
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,400
Last night...

1452
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,430
Last night, I like...

1453
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,160
Like, not warmed up, but practiced just to make sure that I was doing okay.

1454
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,020
And then I lost a lot of games in Celestial.

1455
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,420
On my alt account, I lost like...

1456
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,580
Like, I have a Celestial account, like a Celestial alt account.

1457
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,020
And then I lost a lot of games.

1458
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,820
And I was like, isn't me?

1459
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,020
And I was getting Luna banned too.

1460
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,920
I was getting like Luna...

1461
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,780
No, my main is one above all, guys.

1462
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,040
You can literally see one above all right there.

1463
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:23,000
No, I wasn't tilting because I didn't care about the SR on that account.

1464
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,600
It was really used for practice.

1465
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,580
And then I lost a lot.

1466
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,500
And I was so sad because I was like, isn't me?

1467
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,640
Am I bad at video games?

1468
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,460
Am I washed already?

1469
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,040
I was so... I was like freaking out.

1470
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:48,100
So then I was got really nervous because like, I was just like, oh my god, I don't want to do bad tomorrow.

1471
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,920
So then I like literally like I was in bed, in bed, and I couldn't fall asleep.

1472
00:50:54,060 --> 00:51:01,480
I just like try to... I was in bed trying to sleep for like five hours and I couldn't.

1473
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:10,660
And then I finally went to like I finally fell asleep at 6 a.m.

1474
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,840
I fell asleep at like 6 a.m.

1475
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:19,720
And and then I like the one way to make me fall asleep was that because I was putting videos and stuff and everything.

1476
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,700
I still couldn't sleep.

1477
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,280
And one thing that actually got me to fall asleep was that I put on the newest games.

1478
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,660
I just look at my recommend.

1479
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,040
I just put a random long video in my YouTube recommended.

1480
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:37,900
And my YouTube recommended recommended me a Minecraft game theory video about the tree lore or whatever the fuck.

1481
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,100
I don't remember anything from that video.

1482
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,560
It was like, I don't know.

1483
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,720
Apparently they had a tree.

1484
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,840
They had tree monsters in Minecraft.

1485
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,720
And then I... and then I was... I was so...

1486
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,480
We're watching which team?

1487
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,900
I don't think... does every group have to be finished?

1488
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,020
Or is it just our group?

1489
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,520
Every group has to be... they haven't... because they haven't posted who we're fighting next.

1490
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,640
So every group has to be finished.

1491
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:03,840
Okay.

1492
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,360
So yeah.

1493
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,880
We just have to wait until...

1494
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,440
Because they didn't... they need to wait for all groups to be finished to do a round 2.

1495
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,860
Because we don't know who we're facing next.

1496
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,140
Okay.

1497
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:17,900
Gotcha.

1498
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1499
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,980
So yeah, that was basically... that was basically how I fell asleep.

1500
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,400
And then, when I woke up, I wasn't groggy or tired at all.

1501
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,880
I don't know, but it's an even fight.

1502
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,220
Yeah, it seems like they're getting like...

1503
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,520
Wait, who?

1504
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,140
Are you watching?

1505
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,000
They're gonna run for their money.

1506
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:35,580
Mace.

1507
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:36,800
Oh, Mace?

1508
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,940
Okay, let me look.

1509
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,060
I mean, I can look up the team list right now.

1510
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,020
That's surprising.

1511
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:47,680
I thought Mace's team would do really well because of the individual players.

1512
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,220
Oh, they're just focus banning Mace.

1513
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:49,740
That's why.

1514
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,280
Oh!

1515
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,720
I mean, that was our plan too, so...

1516
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,420
And we had to fight.

1517
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,880
Is that just like a Mag-Strange ban?

1518
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,820
Yeah, yeah.

1519
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,520
I think they protected Mag.

1520
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:05,560
Gotcha.

1521
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,400
Oh, then he has... but he's like...

1522
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,260
He can play Mag.

1523
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:10,860
Oh, yeah.

1524
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,660
Okay, let me look at his team.

1525
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,520
Well, little do people know, his Mag's better than his Strange.

1526
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,680
So...

1527
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,120
Wait.

1528
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,820
We'll keep that info.

1529
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,140
Wait, I'll show you who they're facing.

1530
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,680
And I'm just like...

1531
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:29,840
Okay.

1532
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,720
Let me see if I can...

1533
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,600
This is the right one.

1534
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,340
Let me see.

1535
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,180
Okay, this is...

1536
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,900
I know like... I can kind of see the ELO for each team.

1537
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,160
The average ELO.

1538
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,140
So I'm like, surprised.

1539
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,440
Alright, this is their ELO.

1540
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,180
Average.

1541
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,320
I posted in Team Rocket Raccoon.

1542
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,220
Oh, that is so small.

1543
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,320
Yeah, but you gotta click on it.

1544
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,000
And you can see.

1545
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,360
That's why I'm like...

1546
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,060
I can't read it.

1547
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,940
Just click on the image!

1548
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,040
I am!

1549
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:05,920
It's so small!

1550
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,340
Click on the image!

1551
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,440
And just click zoom in!

1552
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,760
Yeah, and then the top right, there's a zoom in.

1553
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,300
Okay, I got it.

1554
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,360
So, these are who we're against, right?

1555
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,760
These are the people that...

1556
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,320
This is the people Mace is against.

1557
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,520
Oh...

1558
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,600
So I think we're fighting that other team.

1559
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,480
We might be fighting the other team in finals.

1560
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,800
If we make it to finals.

1561
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,200
Gosh, she's so hyped right now.

1562
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,880
No, that team is hard.

1563
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,680
I'm gonna invite y'all, by the way.

1564
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,100
Already in the lobby.

1565
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,360
Did you leave the lobby?

1566
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,980
I'm already in here.

1567
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,180
I'm in here.

1568
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,520
We don't have...

1569
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,380
Who else?

1570
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,460
We don't have Cody.

1571
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,240
Cody, get in here!

1572
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,060
Leave me!

1573
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,300
The next map is...

1574
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,440
Royal Palace Domination.

1575
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,540
Royal Palace Domination.

1576
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,660
Palace?

1577
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,120
Is that the...

1578
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,100
Asgard or whatever?

1579
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,200
That's the Koth map.

1580
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,440
The Koth map with...

1581
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,280
Yeah, the Koth map with the chandelier.

1582
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:20,860
That's the one.

1583
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:22,800
Big ass one.

1584
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1585
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,180
I'm refreshing and we still don't have round 2.

1586
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,740
I'm gonna get a drink.

1587
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,260
I'll be right back.

1588
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,260
To my chat, I hope everybody's VC is good now.

1589
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,640
I muted myself too.

1590
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,780
I don't even remember what I was talking about.

1591
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,120
Oh yeah.

1592
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,300
Tournaments always make me really nervous.

1593
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,540
This tournament makes me really nervous.

1594
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,840
Because it's my first real Marble Rivals tournament.

1595
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,700
So I was like...

1596
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,580
I'm very nervous right now.

1597
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,440
I'm like actually like...

1598
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,980
Super nervous.

1599
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,580
And like...

1600
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,680
Scared.

1601
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,940
Because it's my first Marble Rivals tournament.

1602
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,300
And we actually scrimmed as a team.

1603
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,100
You guys might not know this.

1604
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,260
But we actually scrimmed a lot as a team.

1605
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:21,020
And I really appreciate everybody giving up their time for it.

1606
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,560
Because I organized all the scrims and stuff.

1607
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,420
And I requested hard teams too.

1608
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,000
In this tournament to play against.

1609
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,040
So the hardest team.

1610
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,720
The hardest team that we believe that's in this tournament.

1611
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,100
We actually scrimmed them twice already.

1612
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,520
And that's why when I was talking to my team.

1613
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,000
I was like, I'm scared of that team.

1614
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,520
Because they actually were really good.

1615
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,180
So we like...

1616
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,660
We figured out how to beat them.

1617
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,000
But then like...

1618
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,340
Because the first scrim, they beat us.

1619
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,880
Because they target banned Betel.

1620
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,380
But then like obviously...

1621
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,480
Because it was our very first scrim together too.

1622
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,200
It was our very very first scrim together.

1623
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,940
But then Betel can't be target banned anymore.

1624
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,200
Because he learned other characters.

1625
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,980
So he's okay now.

1626
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,760
But because it was our first scrim.

1627
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,480
So we learned what to do after that.

1628
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,580
It was a huge learning experience.

1629
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,340
Because we were winning.

1630
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,400
And then when they figured it out.

1631
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,580
They were like, okay.

1632
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,340
Now you can play other characters.

1633
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,320
So we're fine now.

1634
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,040
So it's okay.

1635
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,300
But then after they figured us out in the first scrim.

1636
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,840
They beat us in the first scrim.

1637
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,140
And in the second scrim.

1638
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,000
In the second scrim against them.

1639
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,820
We beat them.

1640
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,840
But we had to like...

1641
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,140
Analyze that team.

1642
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,320
We actually researched that team to figure out.

1643
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,440
Because we believe they are the hardest team in the pyramid.

1644
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,300
We believe they are the hardest team.

1645
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,380
We didn't stream their last scrim too by the way.

1646
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,100
We didn't stream that scrim.

1647
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,460
Just because it would be a lot of intel.

1648
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,820
It's like...

1649
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,460
It always goes longer than it's supposed to.

1650
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,040
Just because of admin issues.

1651
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:13,560
Yeah.

1652
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,260
We actually did like...

1653
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,720
I think we did 5 scrims together as a team.

1654
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,320
I'm pretty sure.

1655
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,200
1, 2, 3, 4.

1656
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:23,400
Or 4.

1657
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,800
I think it was like 4 to 5 scrims together as a team.

1658
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,720
At one point we had a double block.

1659
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,600
So we scrimmed together as a team.

1660
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,960
For 4 hours straight.

1661
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,560
With like 2 different teams.

1662
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:35,840
So...

1663
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,740
We wanted to make sure we bonded as a team.

1664
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,720
And that we know what the fuck we're doing together.

1665
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,540
So like...

1666
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,600
That's why I'm nervous.

1667
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,640
Because I'm really appreciative.

1668
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,340
All of us took this very seriously.

1669
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,160
And we actually took the competitive of it very seriously.

1670
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,800
And we were actually analyzing.

1671
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,400
And figuring out what's our best comps.

1672
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:00,800
And everything.

1673
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,020
And making sure our weaker points are...

1674
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:05,340
Like...

1675
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,740
Limeu learned Adam.

1676
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,120
Within 2 weeks.

1677
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,260
Which is crazy.

1678
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,420
Her Adam is fucking insane now.

1679
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,880
Because she never played Adam before.

1680
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,240
And now she's like an insane Adam player.

1681
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,320
Because like...

1682
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,540
We decided to have...

1683
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,840
We decided to...

1684
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,740
We thought Adam was really good for this new meta.

1685
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,060
So she actually learned Adam in 2 weeks.

1686
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,560
And I gave her notes about how to play as a support and everything.

1687
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,440
So like...

1688
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,100
All of us were like...

1689
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,940
Figuring out stuff together.

1690
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,460
And figuring out what characters we each have to learn.

1691
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,940
And what our weakest points were.

1692
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:41,860
And that's why...

1693
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,800
And then we like...

1694
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,620
Beto got coached by Hogs.

1695
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,820
We got Hogs in to coach Beto too.

1696
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,040
So that he wasn't...

1697
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,300
He could play other tanks as well.

1698
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,240
So yeah.

1699
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,180
That's why I'm nervous.

1700
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,260
I was so nervous about this tournament.

1701
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,920
Because it's our first real tournament.

1702
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:58,860
And I was like...

1703
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,100
I was so nervous.

1704
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,280
So that's why I couldn't...

1705
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,420
That's why I hope that...

1706
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,720
Because I didn't sleep that much today.

1707
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,480
I'll be able to sleep earlier.

1708
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,320
I didn't sleep that much yesterday.

1709
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,100
So today I'll be able to sleep more.

1710
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,920
Because I'd be really tired for staying up.

1711
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,160
So I'm just hoping for that right now.

1712
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,080
I hope so.

1713
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,240
I hope we make it today too.

1714
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,700
I really do.

1715
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,500
I just really enjoy...

1716
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,300
If we win all of our games today.

1717
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,240
I'm going to buy...

1718
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,060
Roasted duck.

1719
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,640
No mercy.

1720
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,820
That means no mercy for all our teams going in.

1721
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,540
If we lose even one game, I get no duck.

1722
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,420
Okay.

1723
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,700
We're locking it in bro.

1724
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:00,620
We got the team now.

1725
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,020
We got to add the caster too.

1726
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,880
I'll give you the UID.

1727
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,340
Add the caster and this one.

1728
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:22,610
I'll research them right now real quick.

1729
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,130
I'll do it.

1730
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:29,470
I can literally pull up...

1731
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,470
Because they won their last game.

1732
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,310
They're the magic player by the way.

1733
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,930
They have the magic player.

1734
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:37,510
So we just ban magic.

1735
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:43,190
Yeah.

1736
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,230
And they run strange mag.

1737
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:48,690
And they have a moon knight player too.

1738
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,590
We want to ban moon knight.

1739
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,840
So that's the main thing to look out for.

1740
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,220
Magic, strange, moon knight.

1741
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,720
They run strange mag.

1742
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,000
That's their tank lineup.

1743
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,800
We can ban...

1744
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,040
If they can't play magic, they play storm.

1745
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,610
We just ban magic.

1746
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,110
Magic we don't want to deal with anyway.

1747
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,450
Or ban both magic and storm.

1748
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:18,810
Just say fuck that guy in particular.

1749
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,710
Yeah sure, fuck that guy.

1750
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,710
I think we should ban magic first.

1751
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,050
Yeah, agree.

1752
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,790
But they might keep storm safe after that.

1753
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,790
Then we just gotta figure out what to do.

1754
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:31,550
They have so many casters.

1755
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:34,410
What if we just sneak Betel in as a caster?

1756
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,130
I feel like I've seen more casters than teammates.

1757
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,230
Or like opponents.

1758
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:39,490
I've been just pining for my casters.

1759
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,270
I was like, oh, Bogr is casting for this?

1760
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:44,170
I thought you said Betel.

1761
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:46,290
Because both their names start with B.

1762
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:47,830
Sorry guys.

1763
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,510
We're ready whenever, right?

1764
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:52,210
Or do we have to wait?

1765
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,510
Let us know when our...

1766
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:01,740
Alright, the gamer stuff is kicking in.

1767
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,640
Who's their scariest player?

1768
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,500
I mean, the Celestial one is a support player.

1769
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:07,640
Okay.

1770
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,260
They're all a hidden profile.

1771
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,560
Oh wait, except for...

1772
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,320
No, they're all hidden profiles, so you can't see.

1773
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,380
Everybody's taking it very seriously.

1774
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,460
Alright, who in my team did not hide their profiles?

1775
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,000
Oh, I blocked you.

1776
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,660
Sorry, I blocked Gomez.

1777
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,960
Okay, Chodo.

1778
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,220
They'll just think you're a low-key player.

1779
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,240
Okay, Kony.

1780
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,820
They'll definitely think you're our thing player.

1781
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,280
Wait, none of us hid our profiles?

1782
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,880
Except for me and Night?

1783
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,240
My shit is hidden.

1784
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,120
It's friend only.

1785
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,040
Oh, friends only.

1786
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:51,520
Okay, that's alright.

1787
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,260
That would be so awkward.

1788
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,100
We're good.

1789
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,920
I'll put everything on friends only now.

1790
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,580
Okay, I was gonna be like, Guys!

1791
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,620
That would have been so awkward.

1792
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,020
It's FanKing, Marcins, and Cassie.

1793
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,840
Mine's not private, I think.

1794
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:18,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1795
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,100
You and I were the only ones that were fully private.

1796
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,460
We don't even want friends to know.

1797
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,320
I don't want my friends to judge me.

1798
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,380
I don't want my friends to know my stats.

1799
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:29,980
We're ready to.

1800
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,120
Yeah, let's do it.

1801
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,080
Alright, where's Jay?

1802
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,520
Oh, wait, Jay's not...

1803
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,660
I'm here, I'm here.

1804
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,440
Alright, nice.

1805
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,500
Okay, everything's good.

1806
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:43,500
Alright.

1807
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,060
Yay, alright.

1808
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,540
Let's get it.

1809
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,540
There's professionals, don't worry.

1810
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,360
Alright, I'm gonna be...

1811
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,320
I was gonna be interested to see what they target Ben.

1812
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,400
Alright, let's see.

1813
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,800
Who are they gonna target Ben?

1814
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:09,800
Gomez?

1815
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,580
Oh, they are.

1816
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,080
Alright, well.

1817
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,600
No one wants to play your star though.

1818
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,980
Just get Magic out.

1819
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,080
Alright.

1820
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,400
Ben, Magic.

1821
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,660
And then we keep...

1822
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,340
Luna safe.

1823
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,940
I guess we just keep Luna safe, yeah.

1824
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,360
I love not being able to play that character.

1825
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,980
I mean, you literally played it last game.

1826
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:33,700
What are you talking about?

1827
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,940
You don't even get to play your character in your real scrims.

1828
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:37,780
I know.

1829
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:43,740
Oh, there it is.

1830
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,440
Of course.

1831
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:45,640
Alright.

1832
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,300
What's our second ban?

1833
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,420
I guess we just ban Moon Knight.

1834
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,460
The other player plays Moon Knight.

1835
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:56,760
You know what?

1836
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:57,820
What?

1837
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,640
Do I pull out the fist again?

1838
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,840
I could bring out the Fist of Cuffs.

1839
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,240
Yeah, good team up with Luna.

1840
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:05,840
Oh, yeah.

1841
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,480
They looked at Coney's list.

1842
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,640
They actually looked at Coney's thing.

1843
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:12,780
Wow.

1844
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:15,020
Coney, that's why you should have private.

1845
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,140
You sold, bro.

1846
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,860
You sold us out.

1847
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,680
Oh, wait.

1848
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,720
Do we pull out the three comp against them?

1849
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,020
What's the three comp?

1850
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,780
Hey, you want Mag or Strange?

1851
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,700
I'll play the other one.

1852
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,580
I'll play Garutes.

1853
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,180
Oh, 3-3-3?

1854
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:35,500
I'll play 3-3-3.

1855
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,860
3-3-3?

1856
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,200
Let's see how it goes.

1857
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,260
Let's see it.

1858
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,780
Let's bring out Goats.

1859
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,660
Oh, we're doing this?

1860
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:45,120
Yeah.

1861
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,440
Was I on Mantis or Luna?

1862
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,080
I forgot.

1863
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,980
I think Luna for now.

1864
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,100
Yeah, we need Luna for the heal.

1865
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,740
The defensive.

1866
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,240
I thought this only worked because I had Thing for damage, but maybe Mag has damage.

1867
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,340
Wait, you said they have a Wolverine player?

1868
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,960
No, not this team.

1869
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,100
They might play Wolverine.

1870
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,760
If they play the Wolverine, we just fucking swap comps instantly.

1871
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,620
I go back to Namor.

1872
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,280
This doesn't work.

1873
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:19,040
I think I can swap and just go...

1874
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:23,220
The only issue is that the Storm might farm ult really fast on us.

1875
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,100
Oh yeah, that's true.

1876
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,060
That's true.

1877
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,660
Who's gonna kill the Storm, guys?

1878
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,480
I can kill her.

1879
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,580
I think we just do this then.

1880
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,440
Okay, so 2-1-3?

1881
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,180
That works okay.

1882
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,500
Yeah, I was gonna be like, who the fuck is killing the Storm?

1883
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:45,060
I think if they play any high mobility characters, then yeah, we can pull it out.

1884
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,860
Okay, we'll adjust.

1885
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,620
We'll adjust.

1886
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:49,460
Are they portal?

1887
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,800
Right side.

1888
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,840
Break the top.

1889
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,000
Break the buildings.

1890
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:58,120
Yep.

1891
01:07:59,400 --> 01:07:59,920
Storm is one.

1892
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,420
Storm is dead.

1893
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:02,980
Nice.

1894
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,400
They're gonna split up, no?

1895
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,920
Yeah, I'm pushing up.

1896
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,540
Oh my god, nice.

1897
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,000
That's right.

1898
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,240
What is the Storm gonna do for you?

1899
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,200
Oh my goodness.

1900
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,440
I think...

1901
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,680
I don't know about that portal.

1902
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,400
I threw away so much pressure.

1903
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,540
Yeah, I need heals.

1904
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,000
You guys can heal me real quick.

1905
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:25,980
Sorry.

1906
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,060
I'll get hit.

1907
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,580
I'm gonna farm some portals.

1908
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,020
Nah, you don't need to farm some portals.

1909
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,640
It's not like that urgent.

1910
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:35,920
They're split.

1911
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:37,800
Yeah, I see them.

1912
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,340
They have Hella.

1913
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:41,820
I'm pulling someone in.

1914
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,400
Okay, did you do it?

1915
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,220
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1916
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,280
Holy shit.

1917
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,080
Storm low?

1918
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:52,960
No, no, no.

1919
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,220
We're getting kinda low though, yeah.

1920
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:55,520
Actually.

1921
01:08:58,540 --> 01:08:59,120
Oh,

1922
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,760
we're getting sniped right now.

1923
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,720
I'm going for Storm.

1924
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,080
I'm going too far.

1925
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,120
I got you, I got you.

1926
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,100
Don't be rushed.

1927
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:13,320
Yeah, we can't do it for a show.

1928
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,000
Don't stuck.

1929
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,560
I want...

1930
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,140
Okay, we have copy.

1931
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,920
Copy, copy, copy.

1932
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,380
Copy, copy, copy.

1933
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,660
Copy, please.

1934
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,580
I'm blocking it, I'm blocking it.

1935
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,760
We have two shields.

1936
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,840
3, 2, 1.

1937
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,080
We lost this.

1938
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,440
Okay, it's done, it's done, it's done.

1939
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:39,940
I'm gonna freeze it.

1940
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,840
You're missing Luna.

1941
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,220
I'm coming back.

1942
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,360
I'm not gonna use my ult then.

1943
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,920
Can I try?

1944
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,400
I got you, I got you.

1945
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,880
Again, again, again.

1946
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:55,900
Again.

1947
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,560
One more.

1948
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,620
One more.

1949
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,720
Just one more, bro.

1950
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,840
Just one more, bro.

1951
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,020
Come on, just one more.

1952
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,840
One more again, I need it.

1953
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,760
Dude, my bad on the ult.

1954
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,760
That didn't look like Doctor... My chat is flaming me for the idea.

1955
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,980
That did not look like Doctor Strange, bro!

1956
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,260
I threw it at Cloak, but Strange was standing in front of her and I was like, alright, I'll kill Cloak.

1957
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,080
But then he shielded it and I was like, oh, that's Doctor Strange.

1958
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,360
I thought it was like Moon Knight.

1959
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,560
The skin was weird, man.

1960
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,180
I thought I was gonna let Doki ult first because I thought that's what we agreed on.

1961
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,380
No, no, I didn't have mine yet.

1962
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:47,400
I didn't have it.

1963
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,420
That's why I was like, oh, copy, copy, copy.

1964
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:52,120
Yeah, I just shifted and then did it.

1965
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,000
I was like, oh, damn.

1966
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,680
I was like, SHUT UP!

1967
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,260
It was on me!

1968
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,040
I know, I know, I know.

1969
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:01,060
It was on me, I was so scared.

1970
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,880
That was actually an ult plan.

1971
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,860
A second ult.

1972
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,120
And we milked it, that was part of the value.

1973
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1974
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,520
It's called limit testing, guys.

1975
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1976
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:13,680
Limit testing, yeah.

1977
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,440
Dive for the cause.

1978
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,240
I got Strange ult.

1979
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,880
Can look for something.

1980
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,560
Yeah, we should engage with your ult first.

1981
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,400
And then we'll see how it goes.

1982
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,400
So, we can just walk in with Link.

1983
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,840
Just be really aggressive.

1984
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:32,820
Yeah.

1985
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,480
I can just WQ here.

1986
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,400
Okay, let's just look for ults here, yeah?

1987
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,360
Can I look for something?

1988
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:39,720
Okay.

1989
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1990
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,340
Yeah, just shoot it.

1991
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:45,920
Can't bubble anymore.

1992
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,960
We can't look for a big ult here, okay?

1993
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,380
We can burn that, burn it, burn it.

1994
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,540
Burn ult, burn ult.

1995
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,160
It's okay, it's okay.

1996
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:55,700
I'm pulling him in.

1997
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:57,960
It's fine.

1998
01:11:59,400 --> 01:11:59,840
It's fine.

1999
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,300
We can rez it if you want.

2000
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,680
It's too far out, too far out.

2001
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,040
No!

2002
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:06,860
Oh no!

2003
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,020
We weren't close enough to the body.

2004
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:11,040
Yeah.

2005
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:12,900
Maybe they're feeling scared about it.

2006
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,540
Okay, we got value, we got value.

2007
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,320
Oh my god, now you value.

2008
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,560
Oh no.

2009
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,540
I'm getting hit by Shrays.

2010
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,240
I pulled him in.

2011
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,600
Oh shit.

2012
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,440
Is that soloing or no?

2013
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,460
Oh, that's not fine.

2014
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,500
No, we didn't have the time.

2015
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,060
Reset, reset.

2016
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,720
I'm grouping up, grouping up.

2017
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,300
I have portal, actually.

2018
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,280
Can we look for something?

2019
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,480
I'm good for portal, yeah.

2020
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,420
We're too far up to portal.

2021
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:43,640
Okay.

2022
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:44,160
Let's go left side.

2023
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:46,660
We portal.

2024
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,780
We portal for like touch or any other point.

2025
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,340
I'm just saving that, I'm saving it.

2026
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,440
We might have to swap up out of them for more heals here.

2027
01:12:59,120 --> 01:12:59,720
After this.

2028
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,760
Yeah, I'm pushing up, yeah.

2029
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,540
Oh fuck.

2030
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:04,940
We have copy, we have copy.

2031
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:05,600
Copy, copy.

2032
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,120
Okay, okay.

2033
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,900
Oh my god.

2034
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,960
Everyone was like on top of Doki, I could not see.

2035
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,720
That's fine, that's fine.

2036
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,760
We're still up one, we're still up one.

2037
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:17,660
Yeah.

2038
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,400
Okay, it's done, it's done, it's done.

2039
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:21,040
I'm gonna freeze.

2040
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:22,360
Okay.

2041
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:25,780
Got it.

2042
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,440
I got Agamotto'd.

2043
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,040
This is winnable.

2044
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,740
Do you want me to switch to Sue?

2045
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,120
Yeah, swap to Sue.

2046
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,640
Yeah, swap to Sue.

2047
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,640
I don't think we can get the TP on.

2048
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:40,240
Can we?

2049
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:40,800
No.

2050
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,000
We can, we can, we can.

2051
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:45,500
I'll ult him.

2052
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
I have to jump in immediately right now.

2053
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,260
I'm blocking, I'm blocking.

2054
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,720
I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

2055
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,400
I'm burning that.

2056
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,440
I can block it, I can block it, I can block it.

2057
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,800
I'm going in now, I'm going in now.

2058
01:13:59,180 --> 01:13:59,440
You ready?

2059
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:01,580
3, 2, 1.

2060
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,480
Big ult here.

2061
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,400
Big, big, big.

2062
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,600
3, 2, 1.

2063
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:12,780
I need shields.

2064
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,300
Oh shit.

2065
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,220
I didn't have it.

2066
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,420
We have Sue ult, we have Sue ult here.

2067
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,460
I'm being chased, I'm being chased.

2068
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:21,560
I'm being chased really hard.

2069
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,400
On their backline.

2070
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,140
Oh nice, nice, nice.

2071
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,120
Big pull, big pull.

2072
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,920
Massive, massive, massive.

2073
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,140
Good shit.

2074
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,580
On the left, on the left, on the left.

2075
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:34,720
I'm always waiting.

2076
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,900
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

2077
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:38,980
I'm coming, I'm coming.

2078
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,240
Back, back, back.

2079
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,860
What ult do we have here?

2080
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:44,920
We got Sue ult.

2081
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,340
We got mag ult soon.

2082
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:53,360
We just play for Sue ult.

2083
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,340
Whenever they come in with a...

2084
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:56,240
Careful left, careful left.

2085
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,160
Hold top, hold top by me.

2086
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,560
You're by yourself, Gomez, you're by yourself.

2087
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:02,100
He's fine, he's fine.

2088
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,260
They're coming from top high ground.

2089
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,820
Over here, over here, over here on me.

2090
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,060
Oh fuck me.

2091
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,880
There's bubble though, there's bubble.

2092
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,780
I need some help here, I need some help.

2093
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:14,620
I need help.

2094
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:18,780
I'm with you, I'm literally with you.

2095
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,320
Again?

2096
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,380
There's Storm ult.

2097
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,500
The Storm is right here.

2098
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,300
We have Sue ult for Storm ult.

2099
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,260
When you see the Sue, you just ult yours.

2100
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,700
Yeah, don't push up.

2101
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,300
It's one more push.

2102
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,400
One more fight, one more fight.

2103
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,400
They have Strange ult, they have Strange ult too.

2104
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,060
Yeah, I have Strange ult though.

2105
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,160
I have Counter Strange ult.

2106
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,000
We're over here.

2107
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,440
They're not all in.

2108
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,760
Shoot through the port, shoot through the port.

2109
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,840
Kill them for a big ult here, okay?

2110
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:52,880
Oh my god, he's so close.

2111
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:54,460
Yeah, he's so low, bro.

2112
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,120
We have ult here.

2113
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:58,880
Okay, they counted?

2114
01:15:59,160 --> 01:15:59,360
Yeah.

2115
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,040
Don't do anything, we're fine.

2116
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,840
I pulled the DPS in, pulled them in.

2117
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,380
Are we concealed now?

2118
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,040
Yeah, we need it.

2119
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,260
I got frozen, I got frozen.

2120
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,640
I got frozen.

2121
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,400
Oh, unlucky.

2122
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,260
As I was doing it, I got frozen.

2123
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,240
Yeah, no hesitation there.

2124
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,300
Yeah, you gotta go for it immediately.

2125
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,640
Because I needed to copy it.

2126
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:25,460
After.

2127
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:29,540
Alright.

2128
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,060
I was doing it and I got frozen.

2129
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,420
I was about to take it too, but I didn't know.

2130
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,980
If you were waiting until the last second.

2131
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,300
That's alright, we got ult.

2132
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,400
I'm not sure if that was even targeted on me intentionally.

2133
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,400
No, he was doing it for all...

2134
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,660
We were all grouped up to support.

2135
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,840
So he was targeting the supports intentionally.

2136
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,260
They don't have TP, we don't have TP.

2137
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,160
We just walk up.

2138
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,240
I'm gonna put the snowflake on you.

2139
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,520
So you won't be more aggressive.

2140
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,560
I might swap to the tank still.

2141
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,180
If they get low.

2142
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,180
We go lowkey ult first here.

2143
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,420
I have mine.

2144
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:11,260
I'll ult after lowkey.

2145
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,860
So you don't have to...

2146
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:13,760
Actually no, I'll do strange ult.

2147
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,600
So you can do the other defensive ult.

2148
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,260
Yeah, Doki, you have...

2149
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:23,760
Oh my god.

2150
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,080
Doki, you just be reactive for strange ult.

2151
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,040
Yeah, I do strange.

2152
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,160
I was literally like 3% from strange.

2153
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,740
I could have done it if I had it.

2154
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,820
Is it okay if I use strange ult to trade supports?

2155
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:38,560
Is that not okay?

2156
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,880
No, it's fine, it's fine.

2157
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,120
Yeah, cause then Gormus gets a free ult.

2158
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,060
Okay, I'll call for it always.

2159
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,680
I'm dropping down.

2160
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:51,560
I'm bouncing it.

2161
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:52,780
Am I dropping down?

2162
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,520
I have no idea.

2163
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:54,400
I'm dropping down.

2164
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,560
I'm gonna try to look for a pull.

2165
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:00,940
Yeah, yeah.

2166
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:01,840
No shift, no shift.

2167
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,100
Yeah, no shift.

2168
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:04,960
No runes, no runes.

2169
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,760
No shift.

2170
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,280
Okay, are we walking with ult?

2171
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,120
Yeah.

2172
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:12,560
I'm gonna use, I'm using, I'm using.

2173
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:14,580
Oh, sorry.

2174
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,640
I thought I was going first.

2175
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,160
I was waiting for yours, but I'm doing damage boost.

2176
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,020
Oh, we're both dead, we're both dead.

2177
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,640
You just...

2178
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,080
Okay.

2179
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,800
I got two, I got two.

2180
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,480
I'm on point, I'm on point.

2181
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,300
I'm swapping now.

2182
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,080
We're soaking this point, we're soaking this point.

2183
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:39,420
We can...

2184
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,540
We can stay here.

2185
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:43,500
I can go backline, you ready?

2186
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,140
Go backline here with my ult.

2187
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,160
I'm dying, I'm dying.

2188
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,140
I'm pushing with you.

2189
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:51,960
Yep, I need to get out.

2190
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,400
I'm coming in with ult.

2191
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:53,920
Fuck, I'm dead.

2192
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,840
They don't have point, they don't have point.

2193
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,700
They're low, they're low, they're low.

2194
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,080
We can't anymore, they got point now.

2195
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,440
We got a pick.

2196
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:05,560
We got one pick.

2197
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,700
You can't push up.

2198
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:11,600
Sorry, there was like hesitation, so then I went for mine.

2199
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,040
Because I didn't know if you were going to do it.

2200
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,220
I was, I did it a little too late though.

2201
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:16,840
Yeah, yeah.

2202
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,600
If you hesitate, I would ult.

2203
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,760
I wasn't sure, because Coney died so fast.

2204
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,800
I was like, oh fuck, well, okay, I don't know what to do now.

2205
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,520
Yeah, I got Namor ulted.

2206
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:26,880
Can we jump now?

2207
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,060
I'm pushing up.

2208
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,040
Good job, yeah.

2209
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,840
I have ult up, I'm ready to do it, but I'm waiting for theirs.

2210
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,420
Looking for pull, looking for pull.

2211
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,800
I pulled into Luna, Luna one.

2212
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:39,680
Oh, Luna one.

2213
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,760
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

2214
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:43,860
Got her.

2215
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:46,060
Namor no shift.

2216
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,200
I react on Strange ult.

2217
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,520
Loki down, Loki down.

2218
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,360
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2219
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,140
Oh my god, nice.

2220
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,980
I'm looking at Namor.

2221
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:57,860
We got point.

2222
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:58,700
We should push up.

2223
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:01,320
We need to push up, we need to push up.

2224
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,120
Alright, alright.

2225
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,760
I have ult.

2226
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:09,100
I react to Strange, I react to Strange.

2227
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,080
Looking for a pull.

2228
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,940
I'm looking for a pull right now.

2229
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,180
Let them walk in a little bit.

2230
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:18,760
I have ult, I have ult too.

2231
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,240
Are they going under?

2232
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,900
They might go under.

2233
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:22,800
I see them going under.

2234
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:29,960
Let's go, let's go.

2235
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:30,500
I have squirrels.

2236
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:32,380
That's a really good ult.

2237
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,240
I have Strange ult.

2238
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,160
I can look for a big ult.

2239
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,280
I can look for a big ult here.

2240
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,260
I'm looking for it, I'm looking for it.

2241
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,280
I got you, I got you.

2242
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,140
Just hold it, just hold it.

2243
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,120
Yeah, just hold it, I'm holding it.

2244
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:50,400
Yeah, I'm holding it.

2245
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:52,980
Hold in this range.

2246
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,740
Nevermind, I guess the game didn't want me.

2247
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,520
Dude, they're like cut off, they don't know what to do here.

2248
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,780
Oh my god, this is good.

2249
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,120
They're wasting their time.

2250
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,500
Look at Strange, look at Strange.

2251
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,880
Look at Strange, look at Strange.

2252
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,860
I need shields, I need shields, I need shields.

2253
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,360
I'm going back to point.

2254
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:13,960
I'm going to point.

2255
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:14,420
I'm on the point.

2256
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,780
I'm just holding.

2257
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,920
But she's not doing anything.

2258
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:21,800
Oh, she died, there we go.

2259
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,880
Someone's here, I think I see someone there.

2260
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,960
We have no ults though.

2261
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,280
I got ult too, but...

2262
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,620
They used Strange, they used Mag.

2263
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,520
They have name all up.

2264
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,660
Let's push up a little bit, make them go under again.

2265
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,540
Oh wait, they might TP.

2266
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,820
They're on point, they're on point.

2267
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,520
Looking for vault, looking for vault.

2268
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,720
I'm going to cut off, I'm going to try to get around to you guys.

2269
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,100
I vaulted one, but I'm looking for vault.

2270
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,520
I'm dying, I'm dying, I need heals.

2271
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:49,100
I'm trying, I'm trying.

2272
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,520
I have TP, I have TP, I have Strange TP.

2273
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,940
We got the vault.

2274
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,680
Just fight, just fight, just stay in.

2275
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,660
And then we TP in, we TP in.

2276
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,120
Yeah, I'm porting in, I'm porting in, I'm porting in.

2277
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,720
They're going to try and stagger me, I'm running.

2278
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,660
Are you in this, are you in this?

2279
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:06,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she is, she is.

2280
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,260
I'm dropping on high ground, I'm porting on high ground, I'm porting on high ground.

2281
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,300
Alright, I forced Luna ult, I guess?

2282
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,660
Yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good.

2283
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:19,700
I'm dropping down, I'm dropping down.

2284
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:21,580
I got stunned by Skrugle.

2285
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:22,600
Good shield.

2286
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:23,880
I'm going for Skrugle, okay?

2287
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:25,540
Skrugle one, Skrugle one, Skrugle one.

2288
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:27,800
Strange is one.

2289
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,220
I'm looking at Strange right now.

2290
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,240
I can kill him, I can kill him.

2291
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,140
Skrugle kind of low, Skrugle kind of low.

2292
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,300
He's low, he's low, I got Strange, Strange dead.

2293
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,540
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2294
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,480
Kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me.

2295
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,260
Got you, got you.

2296
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,980
I'm on Skrugle, I'm on Skrugle.

2297
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:39,420
Skrugle, Skrugle, Skrugle, Skrugle, Skrugle.

2298
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:39,920
Skrugle's dead, I got Skrugle.

2299
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:40,820
I'm on Luna, Luna.

2300
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:41,760
I'm on her, I'm on her.

2301
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,800
Luna's low, Luna's so low.

2302
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,640
Luna's one, Luna's one.

2303
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:49,660
She's coming from far under.

2304
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,940
Good job, good job, good job.

2305
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,220
Cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak.

2306
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,280
Where the fuck is...

2307
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,020
What the fuck?

2308
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,020
Guys, guys, focus, focus.

2309
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,680
No, the shield didn't work.

2310
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,960
We have shield as well, we have shield as well.

2311
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:08,500
I'm blocking, I'm blocking still.

2312
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,960
I have ult soon as well, okay?

2313
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,340
I have ult soon as well.

2314
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,160
They should have...

2315
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,540
Their team's back, their team's back.

2316
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:17,640
I have to look for something.

2317
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:18,420
I have to look for something.

2318
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,520
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

2319
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:24,620
Oh my god, bro.

2320
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,000
Holy shit.

2321
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,000
That's huge!

2322
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,740
That's the boys!

2323
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,060
That's the boys!

2324
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,880
Oh my god.

2325
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:35,760
Holy fuck.

2326
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,820
That was a good play.

2327
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,260
Good play there, good play.

2328
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,500
Okay, we shouldn't run 3v3 against this team.

2329
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:47,620
I don't think we should run triple support against this team.

2330
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,720
Oh my god, bro.

2331
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,000
I was eyeing my fucking ult so fucking hard, bro.

2332
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Jesus Christ.

2333
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:57,140
That was a good ult, bro.

2334
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:57,640
That was good.

2335
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:58,660
Thank you, thank you.

2336
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,900
Oh my god.

2337
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:02,400
Oh my god, we comboed it so well.

2338
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:02,840
Yeah.

2339
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:05,560
Do we put Bettle in round 2?

2340
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:06,520
I don't know.

2341
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,400
Do we put Bettle?

2342
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:08,580
We can put Bettle.

2343
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,180
We'll put Bettle in round 2.

2344
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:15,900
I don't know, because if they ban Thing again, I'm way more comfortable on Mag than I am on Strange.

2345
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:16,700
Oh yeah.

2346
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:17,920
You know what I mean?

2347
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:18,780
I mean, I'm okay.

2348
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:23,000
I'm not trying to say what we should do, but if he's more comfortable on Mag...

2349
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:24,220
You know what I'm saying?

2350
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,040
Yeah, yeah.

2351
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:25,940
What do you mean a Mag player?

2352
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:27,780
What's your guys' call?

2353
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,860
I think we should keep Liss then, because this is a harder team.

2354
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:37,960
Just because if they target Bettle, we might be fucked.

2355
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,820
If I get a Thing ban, then I have to be on Mag.

2356
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,740
Or Strange, but I'm worse on Strange.

2357
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:44,300
Yeah, yeah.

2358
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,300
It's okay, guys.

2359
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,380
I'll grab the screenshot off my profile.

2360
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:50,920
Alright.

2361
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:06,010
Alright, we'll just tell Bettle, like, this team might target ban you, so...

2362
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:07,830
Actually, it might be better.

2363
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:12,610
Wait, might target ban you, so...

2364
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:15,330
No,

2365
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,840
we've seen the Bettle-Strange.

2366
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:24,860
Right?

2367
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:25,820
Should we?

2368
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:26,520
Bettle-Strange is not that bad.

2369
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,160
Bettle-Strange?

2370
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:30,400
Oh, so should we get Bettle in here?

2371
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,180
He's been practicing a lot.

2372
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,480
I played with him yesterday.

2373
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,280
He's really good.

2374
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:41,740
Nevermind, you get in here.

2375
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:51,360
Yeah, that was a huge I.

2376
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:53,140
He left.

2377
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:53,960
Unlucky.

2378
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,540
Alright, I'll get Bettle in.

2379
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,280
Where's Bettle?

2380
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,020
Invite.

2381
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:02,640
Wait, what?

2382
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:04,360
He's not online.

2383
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,520
I think he's away because he's spectating.

2384
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,880
He was spectating and stuff.

2385
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,480
All that and then just left.

2386
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,560
He's like, okay, and then bye.

2387
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,800
Welcome back.

2388
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:16,260
I'm out.

2389
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:16,620
I'm in.

2390
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,020
I'm out.

2391
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,100
What's happening?

2392
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,400
Wait, did you not watch?

2393
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:20,980
I was watching.

2394
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:21,760
That was intense.

2395
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,760
It got intense.

2396
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,840
That Namor ult at the end was fucking crazy.

2397
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,500
I wish I was able to see it.

2398
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,960
It was a little messy.

2399
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,080
Sorry on my end for the double support ult.

2400
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,360
No, me too.

2401
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,780
I fucked up as well.

2402
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,340
I think we all fucked up a little bit.

2403
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:43,460
Even that small shit just adds up so much and it's so scary.

2404
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:47,360
I don't think with this team we don't run triple support against this team.

2405
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,060
I think you on a DPS shadow was more value for us.

2406
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:57,620
I think the only time we're going to run that 3-3 is against that one team that we were scrimming against a lot.

2407
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:58,760
No, we're not.

2408
01:26:59,080 --> 01:26:59,720
No, no, no.

2409
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:05,940
No, no, no.

2410
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,580
We're totally not doing that, guys.

2411
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,680
Yeah, we're totally not doing that.

2412
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:14,280
Oh, they're ready, by the way.

2413
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:15,240
They're ready.

2414
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:16,180
I'm ready.

2415
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,080
I'm going to put the screenshot.

2416
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,460
They're good.

2417
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,180
Let's go.

2418
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,780
Huge, huge, huge.

2419
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,540
Yeah, that was to the wire.

2420
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:35,640
Yeah, that was close.

2421
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,920
Yeah, I got a little too close.

2422
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,540
Let's see if they first ban me or not.

2423
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:45,180
Should we even protect Mag?

2424
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,020
You got glazed, by the way, Bettle.

2425
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,360
I'm hearing your strange is really good right now.

2426
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,380
Oh, yeah?

2427
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,060
Who said that?

2428
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,180
Yeah, I said that.

2429
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:58,740
Limu, Shoto, and Coney.

2430
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,300
Yeah, but the practice, yeah.

2431
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,160
Yeah, you've been practicing hard.

2432
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,260
You got coached, too.

2433
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,380
Oh, yeah, let's just protect Mag.

2434
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,100
Wouldn't it be smarter to protect Thing so that Coney can play the Thing?

2435
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,200
That's true.

2436
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,020
I'm good with either.

2437
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,900
Who was our main ban last time, guys?

2438
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,980
It was Magic.

2439
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:22,980
Magic?

2440
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:23,340
Okay.

2441
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,540
You wanna be our I guy?

2442
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:27,140
You wanna be I of Agamotto?

2443
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,700
I'm good to save Thing or Mag.

2444
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:32,280
Your guy's cool.

2445
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:33,940
Let's just save the Thing.

2446
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:36,580
I'm down for that.

2447
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,580
I'm making the call.

2448
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:41,880
At least Bettle can play strange if they ban I.

2449
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,780
Oh, they might do Groot combo.

2450
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:48,280
So we should just ban Groot.

2451
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,900
I'm banning Groot then.

2452
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,660
I think because we banned...

2453
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:53,500
Oh, ban Luna.

2454
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,680
We get Mag and Thing.

2455
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:56,180
This is great.

2456
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:57,620
Yeah, Mag and Thing is great.

2457
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,260
I don't like the combo.

2458
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,720
I don't know if we... This team does a lot of damage.

2459
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,000
I don't know if we should run Adam Su.

2460
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,560
Do we run Adam Su?

2461
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:12,220
I don't know.

2462
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:12,740
We don't have to.

2463
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,060
I'll run Loki's.

2464
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:17,680
We could do this too still, right?

2465
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,540
I don't think we should because I think Eon DPS was a lot more value for us.

2466
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:25,500
Okay, I can do this then.

2467
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,700
I'll run...

2468
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,020
Gomez, get the fuck off Loki right now.

2469
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:34,840
I like playing Loki though.

2470
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:36,500
Get the fuck off Loki.

2471
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,300
Hey, Loki doesn't work on Swap to Cloak.

2472
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,000
Oh, it's this map.

2473
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,680
I said help.

2474
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,080
Oh, we're helping Master Reaver.

2475
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,120
I knew that.

2476
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,280
I mean, if I play safe, I could go Cloak.

2477
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:53,140
Moon Knight kind of gets fucked by Sightlock 24x7.

2478
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,160
Oh yeah, you could do that and I do Bucky.

2479
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:58,420
I'll just play safe.

2480
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,700
My Loki's not that great.

2481
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:02,680
I like it.

2482
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,240
I like it.

2483
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:04,800
I like it.

2484
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:06,940
So I don't have to aim at these.

2485
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:11,920
Yeah, wait, you just countered their Moon Knight since they're always going to be doing Tri Moon Knight stuff then I think because that's why they saved it, right?

2486
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,620
Yeah, that was their intention to do the combo.

2487
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:17,180
So what's the point of playing?

2488
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:20,200
Oh yeah, if they do Moon Knight, then I shouldn't be playing Loki.

2489
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,600
Line for this one, you ult first.

2490
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:24,480
Okay.

2491
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:29,340
I don't see a Moon Knight.

2492
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,240
Oh, I also countered that.

2493
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:32,500
Okay, nice.

2494
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,400
That's perfect.

2495
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,020
Oh wait, we have Bucky.

2496
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,180
Dude, this is so good for us.

2497
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,040
I'm waiting for him to walk in a little bit.

2498
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:47,480
Yeah, I don't really have an angle on this area until they push up.

2499
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,400
Oh, I almost pulled the punch there.

2500
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:49,800
Push her down.

2501
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,420
Someone on top, on the roof, on the roof, on me.

2502
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2503
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,100
Oh no, I need you.

2504
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:01,360
Oh, sorry.

2505
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,940
I had to get on the site because he was on me first.

2506
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,680
Yeah, I put my bubble on you.

2507
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,040
But like, I died for it.

2508
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,660
I'm going for a kill.

2509
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,080
I'm low, I'm low, I'm low.

2510
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:16,500
If you're getting targeted, just walk to me.

2511
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:18,920
And then I just say, Moon Knight on you, and I'll push up bubble.

2512
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,660
Just stand in front of me, stand in front of me.

2513
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:21,740
I don't think it was Moon Knight.

2514
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:22,760
I don't know what it was.

2515
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,760
Yeah, just stand in front of me.

2516
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,200
Stand in front of me, stand in front of me.

2517
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,280
Stand in front of me.

2518
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:31,400
Still on the Punisher.

2519
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,460
No, I'm coming back, I'm coming back right now.

2520
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,840
Oh, they ulted.

2521
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:36,220
Punisher's dead again.

2522
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,720
Yep, ulting.

2523
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:39,640
Nice.

2524
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,480
I'm pulling Strange.

2525
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,160
Oh, Mag, Mag can die too.

2526
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:44,820
Nice, nice, nice.

2527
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:46,240
Another one.

2528
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,100
There's somebody here.

2529
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,020
Got it.

2530
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,560
Let's get it.

2531
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,320
You and me, baby.

2532
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:55,260
There we go.

2533
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,560
They used Moon Knight ult, so they should have Strange and Magneto.

2534
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,680
Yeah, they're low.

2535
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,140
Okay, so they don't have support ult, and they don't have Moon Knight ult.

2536
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,260
When I ult, keep your shield for me.

2537
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:10,260
You got it, yeah.

2538
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,200
I whiffed a kill.

2539
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:16,920
I have ult soon.

2540
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,540
They might go with Strange ult, so I have to make sure I don't get in.

2541
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:28,720
They're letting this shit go back.

2542
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:31,700
I might just look for picks.

2543
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,540
Moon Knight's one.

2544
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,140
Oh, I may have missed there.

2545
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,480
Oh my god, that was a huge bubble.

2546
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,740
Oh my god.

2547
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:40,280
Oh my god.

2548
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:42,980
I'm pulling Strange.

2549
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:43,860
Oh, fuck.

2550
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:47,540
Nice, nice, nice.

2551
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,900
I'll back up.

2552
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,360
I'll be on me.

2553
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,420
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

2554
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:55,420
Oh, okay.

2555
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:57,780
I shield you for the Agumon ult.

2556
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,240
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

2557
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,100
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

2558
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,800
I'm okay for now, but Strange on me, nevermind.

2559
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:04,400
Okay.

2560
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:08,640
It's fine.

2561
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:09,420
Fine.

2562
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:11,500
I'm coming back with ult, I'm coming back with ult.

2563
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:12,320
I should wear ult now.

2564
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:13,620
Come on, Moon Knight.

2565
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:17,140
I'm close to my ult.

2566
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:18,800
I might be able to swap.

2567
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,100
I'm going to swap to Strange and...

2568
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,940
Actually no, I don't know how to fucking play.

2569
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:22,820
I've never played Strange before.

2570
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:26,060
I was going to say, I've never done the portal before.

2571
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,920
It might not be a good idea.

2572
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,380
We're going to have Lime ult soon.

2573
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:30,600
Oh my god.

2574
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,360
We have Lime ult soon.

2575
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:34,880
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch, touch.

2576
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:39,180
Use your ult as soon as you get Lime.

2577
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:40,020
Nice.

2578
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:43,960
For their Moon Knight.

2579
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:45,500
Yeah, he has ult.

2580
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:47,800
He's going to look for a nasty one, so spread out a bit.

2581
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:50,880
Thank you.

2582
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:51,880
Another one.

2583
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:53,400
I'm sitting on point.

2584
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:56,440
Moon Knight.

2585
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,740
Back up, just stay on point.

2586
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:00,160
Stay on point.

2587
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:00,940
We've got 20 seconds.

2588
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:01,780
Don't go crazy.

2589
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,200
They've got to get all the way around.

2590
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,400
Right here, right here, right here, right here.

2591
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,940
Strange, Strange.

2592
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,360
I'm pulling Psylocke.

2593
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:23,140
Break the runes.

2594
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,040
Okay, okay, we're good, we're good.

2595
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,100
Good shit.

2596
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:26,540
I'm on...

2597
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:27,500
Punching Mag.

2598
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:28,740
I'm on Mag, I'm on Mag.

2599
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,160
I'm trying to get the guy on top.

2600
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:31,040
Hold on, I'm going after Dueler.

2601
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:31,740
Dueler dead, Dueler dead.

2602
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,640
Going after Loki.

2603
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:34,360
Got it.

2604
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:38,900
Just Mag, just Mag.

2605
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:39,200
Nice.

2606
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:39,640
Good shit.

2607
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,120
I'm going to pull this guy.

2608
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:42,820
We'll push him away.

2609
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:43,740
Nice.

2610
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:44,240
Nice.

2611
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,000
Good kill, good kill.

2612
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:45,680
They can't.

2613
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:45,840
Yeah.

2614
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:46,360
Good shit.

2615
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:47,540
Yay!

2616
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:51,300
Wait, who... Bro.

2617
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,020
I don't know.

2618
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,980
It's one of the admins.

2619
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,160
Who was it that came in and said, hey Doki, what the hell was that?

2620
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:58,520
I think it was one of the mods.

2621
01:34:59,160 --> 01:34:59,440
We're in game.

2622
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:00,700
Yeah, we're in game.

2623
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:06,640
Oh, they want... Wait, what?

2624
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:08,460
Somebody...

2625
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:10,000
Oh, we were supposed to start on stream.

2626
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,840
Well, we already started the game.

2627
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,000
Game already...

2628
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,500
Game already...

2629
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,080
Yeah, yeah.

2630
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:17,620
Did we restart?

2631
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:18,940
No, we already...

2632
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:20,280
No, no, no, we already started the game.

2633
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:20,640
Oh, no.

2634
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2635
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:23,180
Oh.

2636
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,060
Uh-oh.

2637
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,360
I forgot about stuff.

2638
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:28,760
Whoops.

2639
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:31,760
We were locked in, bro.

2640
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:31,980
I'm sorry.

2641
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:32,880
We're so locked in.

2642
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:33,920
Yeah, we're like...

2643
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,240
We're comming and they're like, Doki.

2644
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,280
And I'm like...

2645
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:40,360
Oh, I'm so excited right now.

2646
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:40,600
Yeah.

2647
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,180
I thought we had a new teammate.

2648
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:44,420
I'm like, who the fuck was that?

2649
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:44,620
Yeah.

2650
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,240
Somebody just came in and said, hey Doki, like a fan?

2651
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:48,060
Like, who is that?

2652
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,500
That's what sticks out, a fan.

2653
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,460
The server code leaked, they got in here.

2654
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:00,680
Okay, well, I guess for the next one we have to make sure that they're spectating.

2655
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:01,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2656
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,180
I thought they were already.

2657
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,320
Yeah, I thought they were in there.

2658
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,340
I guess they got kicked out.

2659
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:07,200
I saw like three people in spectate.

2660
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:13,200
I don't think production knows that they can just stay at the very end, select stream, and then just wait for the next game to start.

2661
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,020
Oh, now they know.

2662
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,200
Oh, they can just look at replay viewer.

2663
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,380
Replay viewer is fine.

2664
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,180
Yeah, yeah.

2665
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:23,800
It's gonna be a little scuffed, but it'll work.

2666
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:24,620
Oh, that's not cool.

2667
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:26,540
I sort of got you there.

2668
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:29,660
Yeah, I'm peeking a little bit.

2669
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,860
I'm looking for a push here, looking for a pull.

2670
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:33,600
I'm playing Mag.

2671
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,840
Mag, Mag pull, Mag pull.

2672
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:35,160
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2673
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,420
I don't have no dash, what am I doing?

2674
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:39,340
Okay, nevermind.

2675
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:40,340
I got away with it.

2676
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:41,240
What are you doing?

2677
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:42,980
Nevermind, I got away with it.

2678
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:44,700
You died.

2679
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,560
I got a kill though.

2680
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:47,940
I got a kill.

2681
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:49,940
One for one.

2682
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,180
Yeah, we walk up, we walk up here.

2683
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:52,720
I'm gonna look for another pull.

2684
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:53,280
I'm playing Mag.

2685
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:54,180
Oh, fuck.

2686
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:54,720
He dodged.

2687
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,080
Strange, strange low.

2688
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,280
I'm gonna get some too.

2689
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:01,840
Nice and easy.

2690
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,900
We're just good against all of them.

2691
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,500
Yeah, nice and easy.

2692
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:04,260
Just walk it in.

2693
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,040
Somebody get those.

2694
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:06,220
Yep.

2695
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:07,300
I can't.

2696
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:08,420
I'm seeing a lot of homes.

2697
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:11,660
Oh my god, he pulled me.

2698
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,160
He's low HP.

2699
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:15,120
He pulled me as soon as I dodged though.

2700
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:15,820
That's so sad.

2701
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:16,700
That's so lucky.

2702
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:18,820
8 HP!

2703
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:19,560
I'm so sad.

2704
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:20,180
Oh no.

2705
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:20,480
Okay.

2706
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:21,300
Backing up.

2707
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:22,320
That's my fault.

2708
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,000
Yeah, back up, back up, back up.

2709
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:23,660
He's too far up.

2710
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,380
It's fine, it's fine.

2711
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,240
We're about to get ults up.

2712
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,080
I'll be there in a second.

2713
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,040
I have ult here.

2714
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:28,600
I can ult.

2715
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:29,340
I ulted for it.

2716
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:29,980
I ulted for it.

2717
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:31,740
I pulled, I pulled many more.

2718
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,960
Wait, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

2719
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:34,820
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

2720
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:35,380
Okay.

2721
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:35,860
Nice.

2722
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:36,840
Okay.

2723
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,220
It's fine, it's fine.

2724
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:39,440
We got...

2725
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,240
We got one pick.

2726
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,640
We walk up with it, walk up with it.

2727
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:41,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2728
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:45,980
Okay.

2729
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,020
I'm pulling, I'm pulling.

2730
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:47,800
Thank you.

2731
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:49,820
I don't have ult, please.

2732
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:50,340
Okay, nice.

2733
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:51,300
That's fine.

2734
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:51,840
Nice, nice, nice.

2735
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,080
I'm blinded.

2736
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:56,420
Look at this one.

2737
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:57,600
They're in the back.

2738
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,520
Magno, Magno.

2739
01:37:58,940 --> 01:37:59,040
Shit.

2740
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:00,920
Actually, that's fine.

2741
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:01,380
That's good, that's good.

2742
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:01,940
Look at the ult, look at the ult.

2743
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:03,620
Oh my god.

2744
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:04,660
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2745
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:05,600
Come on, come on, come on.

2746
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:06,820
Oh, we don't have anything.

2747
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:07,640
We have nothing for that.

2748
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,140
Yeah, we got eye, too.

2749
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:09,920
Eye, they're super dead.

2750
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:11,280
We can...

2751
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:11,880
Oh, that's insane.

2752
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,940
I'm in the back line, beating the shit out of them, but no.

2753
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,400
It's okay, we can... it's good.

2754
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:17,960
Reset here.

2755
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,120
I miscounted their ults.

2756
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,480
I didn't know they had a heal ult there.

2757
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,420
They have no support ults, though.

2758
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:26,520
They have no support ults for you, Gomez.

2759
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:28,620
Use both.

2760
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:29,720
Use both?

2761
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,740
Yeah, use both, use both.

2762
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,480
Yeah, we got Bucky and Psylocke.

2763
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,660
We should go...

2764
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:36,340
Should we do Bucky first or Psylocke first?

2765
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:39,760
I can do...

2766
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,340
I can do first.

2767
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:40,620
Okay.

2768
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:40,820
Yeah.

2769
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,080
Okay, you go first.

2770
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,800
We'll wait for your pick.

2771
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,180
Alright.

2772
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:48,440
Got one.

2773
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:49,660
Good.

2774
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,700
Go for it, go for clones.

2775
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:52,640
Yup.

2776
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:53,420
Nice.

2777
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:53,960
Reset.

2778
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,200
There we go.

2779
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:55,420
Alright.

2780
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,340
I'm on mag, I'm on mag, I'm on mag.

2781
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:57,980
Got the root again, though.

2782
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,580
Got the reset, got the reset, got the reset.

2783
01:38:58,660 --> 01:38:59,580
Root again, though.

2784
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:00,500
Wait, this guy is good.

2785
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:01,440
Got reset, got another reset.

2786
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:02,340
Oh, yeah.

2787
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:02,580
No!

2788
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:03,040
No!

2789
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,520
Wait, that's fine, we can do this, that's fine.

2790
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:07,540
Where is she?

2791
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:07,860
Okay.

2792
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:08,920
Okay, it's fine.

2793
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:09,760
Did Bettle DC it?

2794
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,200
Yeah, he still won.

2795
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:12,940
Oh, he DCs.

2796
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:13,700
Oh, my goodness.

2797
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,580
He was BMing, he knew we would win.

2798
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,220
He BMed so hard.

2799
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,220
Bro, that's crazy.

2800
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:23,440
Dude, honestly, I thought someone on their team left or something, but then it was Bettle, I thought she was BMing.

2801
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,900
We don't need a restart, guys.

2802
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:25,840
We don't need a restart.

2803
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:28,120
You got this, guys.

2804
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:28,920
I'm gonna take five.

2805
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,020
Alright, we're done with round two.

2806
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,040
Round two is done.

2807
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,740
Two more games, two more matches.

2808
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,820
What's the next one?

2809
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:41,460
Let me see.

2810
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:43,580
Alright.

2811
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,040
Let me just...

2812
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,900
Let me screenshot this.

2813
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:56,130
I think we just send the replay code, because we started without them.

2814
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:58,010
Just rewatch it.

2815
01:39:59,330 --> 01:39:59,830
Welcome back.

2816
01:39:59,830 --> 01:40:01,090
Guys, my game crashed.

2817
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:03,010
It's okay, we won.

2818
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:04,110
It's okay.

2819
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:05,790
We won.

2820
01:40:06,430 --> 01:40:07,610
I did a BM lead.

2821
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:09,450
We thought you were BMing.

2822
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,950
We thought you were like, yeah, you got this.

2823
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:12,410
I'm done.

2824
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:14,390
That won't happen again.

2825
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:18,150
I have never had a game crash before.

2826
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:20,030
That's crazy.

2827
01:40:21,410 --> 01:40:22,010
That's funny.

2828
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:24,190
I'm gonna be right back.

2829
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:25,910
I need to use bathroom too.

2830
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:26,470
I'll be right back too.

2831
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,610
Yep, me too.

2832
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:28,090
One sec.

2833
01:40:30,410 --> 01:40:30,750
Alright.

2834
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:32,950
I sent them the match code, so then...

2835
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:35,270
They know what to do.

2836
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:37,990
Dude, what are the...

2837
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:38,810
Dude, that's crazy.

2838
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:40,830
Yeah, you were...

2839
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:42,450
We know you were just doing it on purpose.

2840
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:43,890
I got critical error.

2841
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:45,030
You did?

2842
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:45,630
I got that too.

2843
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:46,670
I got that too, one time.

2844
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:47,790
Before I changed PCs.

2845
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:50,370
Did you update your drivers?

2846
01:40:51,130 --> 01:40:52,170
My drivers have been...

2847
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:53,430
Yeah, I did that like last week.

2848
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:55,050
Okay, that's the problem.

2849
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:56,130
The drivers...

2850
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:56,890
No, what?

2851
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:57,610
You have to roll back.

2852
01:40:58,110 --> 01:40:58,890
Yeah, you have to roll back.

2853
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:02,030
I did it in preparation for this.

2854
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:05,550
You gotta go back.

2855
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:06,690
Go back one driver.

2856
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:09,410
Yeah, this version of the drivers is unstable with mobile drivers.

2857
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:12,230
I think like two more versions back, I think, was good for me.

2858
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:12,610
Or three.

2859
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:13,890
You have to check.

2860
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:15,810
Oh, I'm on the patch before it.

2861
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:16,970
It's working fine.

2862
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:19,530
That's insane.

2863
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:21,650
That's insane.

2864
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:25,090
What's insane?

2865
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:26,050
What happened?

2866
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,790
So, if you update...

2867
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:32,690
Yeah, so if you update your drivers to the most recent ones for NVIDIA...

2868
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:38,610
It has some really bad crashing problems when it comes to the drivers.

2869
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:41,910
Yeah, this is why I don't update until my PC dies.

2870
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:44,530
Oh, you don't update your drivers?

2871
01:41:44,770 --> 01:41:48,890
I update my drivers every three to four months.

2872
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:49,970
What?

2873
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:52,930
Because you don't update right away.

2874
01:41:53,130 --> 01:41:54,590
That's the thing.

2875
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:56,550
What?

2876
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:57,430
Three to four months?

2877
01:41:57,530 --> 01:41:57,870
Yeah.

2878
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:00,250
I mean, one time I didn't update my drivers for a year.

2879
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:02,230
Actually, no, you're right.

2880
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,950
You're right.

2881
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:05,070
It's like, why would you update to the next Windows yet?

2882
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:06,450
Yeah, you don't know.

2883
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:11,010
I remember for Apex, you don't do it right away, so it was just habit.

2884
01:42:12,030 --> 01:42:16,090
Because in Apex, they had a thing where if you updated to a new driver, you'd lose frames or some shit.

2885
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:21,330
And you had to use the specific driver, and then they fixed it, but then I didn't realize they fixed it.

2886
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:25,650
So I used a year-old driver because I didn't realize they fixed the thing.

2887
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:27,090
Oh.

2888
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:30,350
Because it was like an Apex issue.

2889
01:42:32,090 --> 01:42:32,530
Jesus.

2890
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:35,870
Alright.

2891
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,330
That wasn't our hardest team, though.

2892
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:39,070
That's the thing.

2893
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:40,270
It wasn't?

2894
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:40,790
Yeah.

2895
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:42,310
I personally think...

2896
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:42,770
That wasn't too bad.

2897
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:43,250
Yeah.

2898
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,590
No, you weren't there for the Domination one.

2899
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:51,950
Domination one was a little too close, but I think we were just really messy, too.

2900
01:42:53,190 --> 01:42:54,310
We were super messy there.

2901
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:55,710
That was our first match as well.

2902
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:58,410
I feel like we were kind of warm and ready.

2903
01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:04,630
I think we were trying to figure out what comp to play against them, and now we know triple support doesn't work against that team.

2904
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:07,530
I'm scared of the next team.

2905
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:09,270
Come on, where is it?

2906
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:15,570
I like it when we have triple support with Venom.

2907
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:20,650
I think that works better, when we have Venom and triple support.

2908
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:23,850
I agree.

2909
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:25,350
I think so, too.

2910
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:28,030
I think we definitely did a lot better with it.

2911
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:30,710
We're still on the Duck Train, so that's good.

2912
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:33,570
Still on the Duck Train.

2913
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:37,610
We were the first team that finished, too, so our teams are still fighting.

2914
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:38,230
Really?

2915
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:39,250
I thought we won for a bit.

2916
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:41,810
Actually, no, because we never passed that first point, so that makes sense.

2917
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:45,710
I think it's just Domination has a set time, too.

2918
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:47,310
Yeah.

2919
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:48,750
You know what I was just thinking?

2920
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:54,790
It's so funny, because Beto was talking about how it's hard to play strange ult, and it's very obvious when you're walking up, and it's hard to do.

2921
01:43:55,270 --> 01:44:03,530
And then every strange we've seen today, when they're about to ult, they just randomly aggro the person all the way in the back and walk through everybody on the team.

2922
01:44:05,170 --> 01:44:10,150
It's like their sleeper phrase was activated, and now they want to get right to the back.

2923
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:12,230
It's so funny to watch.

2924
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:19,290
Also, the classic Coney, the fly up in the air, and they just forget about you.

2925
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:20,710
Yep, they disappear.

2926
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:24,170
Where did the strange go?

2927
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:25,450
He's not in front of me.

2928
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:26,090
He's gone.

2929
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:29,470
Marvel rival players have no object permanence.

2930
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:33,490
No, every shooter player has no object permanence.

2931
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:34,950
He must have died.

2932
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:37,750
Did he go to heaven?

2933
01:44:38,910 --> 01:44:40,730
No, he raptured up to heaven.

2934
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:41,610
That's what happened.

2935
01:44:42,670 --> 01:44:43,910
God called him back.

2936
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:45,350
Yeah, God called him.

2937
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:52,730
Gamers don't look up or down, they just look straight ahead.

2938
01:44:56,370 --> 01:44:57,050
It's true.

2939
01:44:58,130 --> 01:45:00,030
So next game is in what, five minutes?

2940
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:08,270
Depending, well, whenever the team's finished, let me look at, let me scout out who's posted their results.

2941
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:12,510
Yeah, Oni, the Oni image won.

2942
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:18,250
They started erase, they started like...

2943
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:27,110
They started, okay, it's funny, that's smart, but like, they started erasing what they play.

2944
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:31,870
Wait, you can, you didn't see that, how?

2945
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:37,550
They just, like, they just drew up, I'm just gonna post it, like, it's like, fucking public knowledge, like, this is what they do.

2946
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:42,850
What, bro?

2947
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:45,130
They're scared.

2948
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:46,730
That is insane.

2949
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:47,790
They're scared.

2950
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:52,550
They're posting results with the characters out, I can see the background.

2951
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:53,890
Yeah, you can see the background.

2952
01:45:54,570 --> 01:45:56,750
We literally see the background.

2953
01:45:57,510 --> 01:45:58,470
They're right there.

2954
01:45:58,470 --> 01:46:00,070
They're right there, I see Storm.

2955
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:05,430
Storm, I see Storm, Rocket, Punisher, Thor, and Venom.

2956
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:07,850
I see all three of those.

2957
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:09,090
Wait a second.

2958
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:14,430
Oh my god, bro, they wanna win.

2959
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:17,170
KB is the Rocket player, okay.

2960
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:18,850
That's very funny.

2961
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:21,550
That is pretty funny.

2962
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:31,830
I think, I don't know, they're, like, listening to me, cause I'm scouting, so they might have listened to me saying what they're playing.

2963
01:46:32,330 --> 01:46:34,910
Oh, they better not, they better not scratch out the whole thing.

2964
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:38,290
My chat said we should reply with their lineup to scare them.

2965
01:46:39,030 --> 01:46:40,230
I completely agree with that.

2966
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:42,710
I would love to do that, I want to do that so bad.

2967
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,610
Guys, we gotta win, guys.

2968
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:47,210
How did they know?

2969
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:48,950
That's good tech, that's good tech, hold on, let's see.

2970
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:52,030
Interesting.

2971
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:55,730
That's funny, that's so funny.

2972
01:46:57,130 --> 01:46:58,910
I was just like, alright, what are they playing?

2973
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:05,600
That's crazy.

2974
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:14,500
But, no, this is the Spider-Man, they have Spider-Venom players for this one, but I don't think they're running it.

2975
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:16,680
They don't seem to be, they're not running it, so.

2976
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:20,120
I think they probably had it in the ban line.

2977
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,260
Probably, no they didn't.

2978
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:29,740
Their ban line was Black, the enemy team banned Magic and Black Panther on them.

2979
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,540
Oh, so they have a lot of divers?

2980
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:38,340
And then they also banned Wolverine, they have a Wolverine player, I know that, they have a Wolverine player.

2981
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:40,220
Oh.

2982
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:41,680
Ew.

2983
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,840
Well, yeah, I'm right here, by the way.

2984
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:47,480
Right here, my bad.

2985
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:49,520
Is this a bracket?

2986
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:52,580
Like, do we keep playing teams that keep winning?

2987
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,300
Or is it just random?

2988
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:55,820
Do we know?

2989
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,080
I don't know.

2990
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:03,160
I assume it's Swiss, like, if you win then you play another winning team, you know?

2991
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:04,640
Probably is.

2992
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,300
So the team we're fighting next is that one?

2993
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:15,980
Yeah, I think it could be, because we were playing against teams that have won their games.

2994
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:17,820
Are you guys grabbing Jay?

2995
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,900
We go Beto first or Jay first?

2996
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,760
Let's do Jay first.

2997
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,420
We'll keep the rhythm like that.

2998
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:29,780
Yeah, keep the rhythm, the back and forth rhythm.

2999
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:32,980
Alright, I'll bring him in.

3000
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:35,480
No, Beto.

3001
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:36,660
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

3002
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,980
Beto, go back to jail you go.

3003
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:41,500
Back to jail.

3004
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:45,660
I miss him already.

3005
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,880
Hello, I'm back.

3006
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,860
Welcome back, welcome back.

3007
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,600
Thank you.

3008
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:01,940
Did you see what happened?

3009
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:05,480
Did you see in our little team chat, Jay?

3010
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:06,640
Team chat?

3011
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:07,460
Oh shit, what?

3012
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:10,000
The team Rocket Raccoonantes.

3013
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:11,180
Yeah.

3014
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:17,360
They tried covering up all the characters, but you can still see the background.

3015
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,200
That's so funny.

3016
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:21,760
Wait, what?

3017
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:30,260
I think they should not have made the group A result public.

3018
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:31,900
I'm not going to lie.

3019
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:41,200
They shouldn't have made this public, because you can see what they're playing against other teams.

3020
01:49:42,740 --> 01:49:47,820
The thing is, all of us can access it too, not just me.

3021
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:50,420
That's really awkward.

3022
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:56,950
I didn't even realize that you can see the characters in the background.

3023
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:02,310
That was a cherry on top, I just realized that.

3024
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:08,030
I feel like they should have just went to the match history and then screenshot it and then erased the thing.

3025
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:08,930
Yeah.

3026
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:11,050
That'd be a lot smarter.

3027
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:15,930
We're waiting for 1, 2, 3, 4 more teams for their matches.

3028
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:18,270
I see, we can chill for now.

3029
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:20,110
Yeah, and then we have two more.

3030
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:26,770
If we fight only Amidst, that's the other hard team in our group.

3031
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:33,370
If we fight them after this, then the team after that wouldn't be as hard.

3032
01:50:36,070 --> 01:50:36,890
I see, I see.

3033
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:38,970
That's the main thing we want to get out of their way.

3034
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:47,310
I don't think we should run Classic 2-2-2 for them, because they run dive characters.

3035
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:50,310
So I don't think we should run Triple Support.

3036
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:56,110
Or we could run 3-3, we just need to ban Wolverine.

3037
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:58,590
Because then their dive would do nothing against us.

3038
01:51:00,230 --> 01:51:01,370
It really depends.

3039
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,760
Okay, I muted myself.

3040
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:07,480
I'm nervous.

3041
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,920
I'm fucking nervous this entire day.

3042
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,240
I don't know if I'm playing well.

3043
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:15,280
I feel like I'm making a lot of little mistakes.

3044
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:16,920
I fixed it.

3045
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,380
I fixed their image.

3046
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:22,080
I made so many little mistakes.

3047
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,580
I don't know if I'm doing well.

3048
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,560
Am I doing okay, guys?

3049
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:30,820
Please reassure me.

3050
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:34,380
I was like, no, no way.

3051
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:35,880
Please reassure me.

3052
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:38,380
I was like, thank God, bro.

3053
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,120
Holy shit.

3054
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,620
Oh my God.

3055
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:48,860
Thank you, guys.

3056
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:49,660
Thank you.

3057
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:51,860
I'm glad.

3058
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:52,860
I'm glad that...

3059
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:57,780
I'm glad that you guys think I'm doing okay.

3060
01:51:57,780 --> 01:51:58,760
I'm really happy.

3061
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:01,440
Yeah, we're waiting for... the other teams aren't done yet.

3062
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:04,300
There's like three teams that are still fighting.

3063
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:10,100
Yeah, get them out of here.

3064
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:14,940
This is our lobby.

3065
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:16,420
We're not remaking.

3066
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:23,340
I'll put Jay in here and Coney in here.

3067
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:26,400
Coney, why are you leaving the lobby?

3068
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:27,540
We're always here.

3069
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:31,580
Why is Coney leaving?

3070
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:39,300
I fixed their screenshot, but I feel like it's a BM.

3071
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:40,880
Wait, what did you do?

3072
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:43,300
Look in the chat.

3073
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,080
I fixed it.

3074
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:47,940
What is this?

3075
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:54,900
Alright, analyzing the heights.

3076
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:58,400
Analyzing the heights to see where they're at.

3077
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,540
Okay, that's definitely not Raccoon.

3078
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:02,580
That's crazy.

3079
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,080
That's actually crazy.

3080
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:14,060
I feel like I'm gonna make a suggestion and just be like, lock the group A result.

3081
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:19,080
Like, lock it so we don't see the other teams.

3082
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:23,540
That's like the easiest fix, to be fair.

3083
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:30,560
I don't mind.

3084
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,880
No, I don't mind not covering.

3085
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:36,840
Cause like, I feel like on day two, people would just watch our VODs.

3086
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,780
There's no point in covering it.

3087
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:43,960
They'll just watch our VODs.

3088
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:46,280
And they'll be like, well, these are what they play.

3089
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:47,940
Cause I'm fucking watching VODs after.

3090
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:51,040
To see who makes it.

3091
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:55,740
What the fuck?

3092
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:57,000
Group C is already playing.

3093
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:57,900
What the fuck?

3094
01:53:57,960 --> 01:54:00,480
Group C and D and F already have their games.

3095
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:01,420
This is not fair.

3096
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,660
They already got their group matchups.

3097
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:06,540
We gotta wait.

3098
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:10,600
They're progressing fast.

3099
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:14,320
There's like teams that are just like, basically...

3100
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,460
One more team left.

3101
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,680
Just one more team and then we should be good.

3102
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:37,720
I'm curious as to like, which team we're gonna...

3103
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:40,760
Which team we're gonna fight?

3104
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:43,900
I think most likely we're fighting the Oni one.

3105
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:48,100
Let's see.

3106
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:52,220
Cause who did they fight last time they fought 5Pixels?

3107
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:56,480
I keep forgetting that I have another tournament after this.

3108
01:54:56,620 --> 01:54:57,940
I'm like, oh, I'll be done.

3109
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,720
Yeah, but like...

3110
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:00,640
No, you're not done, bro.

3111
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:02,720
You got more work to do.

3112
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,520
Yeah, you got a lot of work to do.

3113
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:07,680
You wanna ditch that tournament?

3114
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:09,220
You win more money for this one anyway.

3115
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:15,400
Also, through how long this is lasting, I don't think I can play the first round.

3116
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:16,400
They're gonna have to play without me.

3117
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,600
Yeah, cause we're waiting.

3118
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:20,460
I mean, yeah, we're waiting a lot.

3119
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,460
Unless we like...

3120
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:24,320
Like, we gotta get the last round really fast.

3121
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:27,800
Round 4 just has to be like, super fast.

3122
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:29,900
Yeah.

3123
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:31,640
Or round 5.

3124
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,540
We can finish round 5 fast too.

3125
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:35,240
I gotta like, dip immediately.

3126
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:38,260
Yeah, but you'll be warmed up by then.

3127
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:39,560
I will.

3128
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:43,300
My whole team will be asleep and I'll still be warmed up and ready.

3129
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:45,140
I don't know.

3130
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,120
Hog is still warming up right now.

3131
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:48,920
He's the only one that's live.

3132
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:52,520
Checking this... They're still playing.

3133
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,280
Yeah, they're still playing.

3134
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:58,120
Which team's still going?

3135
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:01,720
It's the Island and Goonites.

3136
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:04,580
They're still going, so we're waiting on that.

3137
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:09,200
Oh my god, you're right.

3138
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:09,680
They are still going.

3139
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:10,080
It's on overtime.

3140
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:12,760
How long is this overtime?

3141
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:17,060
It's on... They're on overtime?

3142
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:19,620
Oh my god.

3143
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:24,160
I mean, they haven't posted screenshots yet of their matches, so...

3144
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:26,700
We just wait.

3145
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,930
Guys, I just know that like...

3146
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:43,020
If I'm like super nervous right now, day 2, I'm gonna be a mess.

3147
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:50,740
I'm gonna be a fucking mess on day 2.

3148
01:56:57,020 --> 01:56:58,920
Thank you guys.

3149
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:01,660
I'm trying not to drink too much gamer stuff.

3150
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:08,840
I haven't been drinking the gamer stuff anymore because I'm worried that if I drink too much, I'm gonna get too caffeinated.

3151
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:15,180
Yeah, I'm thinking by then, I'm gonna stay up.

3152
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:19,380
I'm gonna stay up just so I can be super tired by tonight.

3153
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:24,320
Also, I'm not used to waking up so early too, so my body's not used to it and everything.

3154
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,640
So, yeah.

3155
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:33,620
And then like, I'm trying not to get too caffeinated right now because I get like super jittery if I get too caffeinated.

3156
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,560
So I'm just drinking water.

3157
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:43,500
I need to remember to feed Doki Ember Doge in 2 hours too.

3158
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:46,920
Please.

3159
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:48,540
It happened.

3160
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:49,160
Please.

3161
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:51,820
Or is their game... Their game's not finished yet.

3162
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:52,940
No!

3163
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:53,580
No!

3164
01:57:54,380 --> 01:57:56,140
They all get to play!

3165
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:59,720
All the other teams are playing!

3166
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:02,720
3 groups are already playing!

3167
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:03,520
No!

3168
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:06,960
I'm gonna start scouting.

3169
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,200
I'm gonna scout.

3170
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:09,720
Okay.

3171
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:12,560
What was the final stage?

3172
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,180
Group G.

3173
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:18,080
Alright, who's their best player in group... Who's their best team in group G?

3174
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:20,020
Alright.

3175
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:22,140
Scouting time.

3176
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:26,500
All I care about...

3177
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:26,500
Okay.

3178
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:29,700
Oh, this team is... This team is actually decent.

3179
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:32,900
Okay.

3180
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,300
Thank God.

3181
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,260
We don't... We can't look.

3182
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:39,220
I'm just gonna make sure I watch VODs after this too.

3183
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:42,520
I hate the in-between.

3184
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,600
The in-between is the roughest part.

3185
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:45,440
Just waiting.

3186
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:47,180
Oh wait, they posted it!

3187
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,220
Okay, they won.

3188
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:49,080
Okay, nice.

3189
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:50,060
They won.

3190
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:51,880
But thank God.

3191
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:52,940
Did they actually go overtime?

3192
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:53,860
Okay, we're good.

3193
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:56,620
We find the Oni inmates.

3194
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:57,460
I knew it.

3195
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:59,440
I knew it.

3196
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:01,960
Is this the hard team?

3197
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:02,660
Yeah, that's the hard team.

3198
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:03,180
That's the hard team.

3199
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:07,140
That's the... Okay, who do we want to ban for them?

3200
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:10,480
I think Wolverine, right?

3201
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,100
I kind of want to go with the Rocket pick.

3202
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,760
Maybe ban Rocket or... I mean...

3203
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:17,020
Because they do punish your Bucky, so...

3204
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:20,100
Banning Rocket is good as well.

3205
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:21,800
Yeah, let's just ban Rocket then.

3206
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:27,180
I'll give you the idea for them.

3207
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:31,020
Here, this is their...

3208
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:32,020
Invite this person.

3209
01:59:35,180 --> 01:59:38,020
This was the one I researched earlier too, so...

3210
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:43,020
And for them, they played...

3211
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,300
Yeah, they mostly try to do Punisher.

3212
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:49,520
They do Punisher, Bucky, and Wolverine.

3213
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:51,260
Should we ban Wolverine or do you think you're...

3214
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:54,040
I mean, you're definitely the better Wolverine, but...

3215
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:54,520
Of course.

3216
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:56,360
For our tanks though, would they be...

3217
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:56,900
Okay.

3218
01:59:59,060 --> 01:59:59,660
Oh gosh.

3219
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:01,400
That's the thing.

3220
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,020
Because we could do Wolverine, Rocket...

3221
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:07,320
Do you...

3222
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:10,540
Oh gosh, I was like building that up for like a minute.

3223
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:11,780
Oh, bless you.

3224
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:12,820
Yeah, bless you.

3225
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,240
What are you thinking?

3226
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,600
Yeah, look at this team.

3227
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,580
Like I said, this team has the highest average in our group.

3228
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:21,400
Alright, let's see.

3229
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:23,040
They're all...

3230
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,280
Oh.

3231
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:24,560
Nevermind.

3232
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,580
Fuck, they are all...

3233
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:27,800
Okay.

3234
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:28,740
Yeah, no, they're...

3235
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:29,640
They...

3236
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:30,520
Gomez, they hot.

3237
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:33,200
They fucking scrape their characters.

3238
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:34,800
Of course, they're gonna hide their profiles.

3239
02:00:38,060 --> 02:00:41,340
They fucking scrape their hero pool off of existence.

3240
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:46,020
Wait, what about Venom, Spidey?

3241
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:48,160
Yeah, they want Venom, Spider-Man too.

3242
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:50,320
We could do...

3243
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,100
We could ban Rocket, Spider.

3244
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:59,540
How much ping do you get to Dallas, Jay?

3245
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:02,900
Okay, let's see.

3246
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:03,740
205.

3247
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:04,960
There's no difference.

3248
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:06,280
Oh, we can't because...

3249
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:06,800
205, what do you get now?

3250
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:07,560
No, but Limeu.

3251
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:08,520
225.

3252
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:10,340
Yeah, I think it's okay.

3253
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:11,660
We prefer...

3254
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:13,560
We can't...

3255
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:14,040
Oh, Limeu.

3256
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:15,600
For our EU player.

3257
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:17,280
We'll just be like, we can't for our EU player.

3258
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:18,500
Okay.

3259
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:19,000
Yeah.

3260
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,480
And then we have ping advantage, oh my god.

3261
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:22,540
Let's go.

3262
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:23,000
Yeah.

3263
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:26,700
They're all green bar.

3264
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:27,280
Yeah, they're all...

3265
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:27,980
Yeah, they're all green.

3266
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:30,200
But maybe it's like a little bit higher, maybe.

3267
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:31,060
I don't know.

3268
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:35,720
Maybe the lag will throw them off a little bit.

3269
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:38,180
I mean, for DPS, they'll throw them off.

3270
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:39,360
What did we change?

3271
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:42,360
Oh, they wanted Dallas server, but we can't because we're like...

3272
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:45,340
Oh yeah, Dallas would fuck me a little bit.

3273
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:45,700
Yeah.

3274
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:49,040
Yeah.

3275
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:51,260
Like, they're all green bar.

3276
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:53,060
We're literally the only team that's not green.

3277
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:54,560
Yeah.

3278
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:58,320
So, like, we have to play on East Coast.

3279
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:01,960
Let us know when...

3280
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,160
30 MS difference for me.

3281
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:08,400
Which is a lot when it takes me over 100 and something.

3282
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:09,380
Wait, I just thought of it.

3283
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,220
Yeah, the Thor player has a Thor icon.

3284
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:14,320
They don't run Thor all the time.

3285
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:15,340
They run...

3286
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:16,500
They...

3287
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:18,120
Is that the Venom player?

3288
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,500
That's their dive play.

3289
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:22,140
They do Thor...

3290
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:22,780
Wait, what was it?

3291
02:02:22,940 --> 02:02:23,500
King...

3292
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:24,120
They do...

3293
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:26,040
Yeah, Thor and Venom.

3294
02:02:29,570 --> 02:02:31,250
What's the map for this one?

3295
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:34,770
This one, it's Convoy.

3296
02:02:35,810 --> 02:02:38,350
It's the low-key map in Convoy.

3297
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:41,550
Low-key map Convoy.

3298
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:42,930
The Yggdrasil path.

3299
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:43,750
Yggdrasil.

3300
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:44,810
Yggdrasil path, yeah.

3301
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:46,930
They're ready, by the way.

3302
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:48,090
They're ready?

3303
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:49,090
But are we ready?

3304
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:51,230
I'm ready.

3305
02:02:52,610 --> 02:02:53,190
I'm ready.

3306
02:02:54,130 --> 02:02:55,550
Everyone's spoken except for Lymu.

3307
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:56,810
Oh, yeah, I'm ready.

3308
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:57,070
Sorry.

3309
02:02:57,290 --> 02:02:57,750
Okay, Lymu's here.

3310
02:02:57,790 --> 02:02:58,350
Just chillin'.

3311
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:00,990
And Coneyboy is here, right?

3312
02:03:01,330 --> 02:03:01,790
Yeah, I'm here.

3313
02:03:02,230 --> 02:03:02,650
Of course.

3314
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:02,950
Okay.

3315
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:03,410
Alright.

3316
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:05,530
Wait, do we invite anyone?

3317
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:06,210
No spectators?

3318
02:03:06,270 --> 02:03:06,670
No.

3319
02:03:06,670 --> 02:03:07,150
No spectators.

3320
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:07,470
We're good?

3321
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:09,630
No casting for this one.

3322
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:10,770
Oh, thank God.

3323
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:11,130
Okay.

3324
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:11,930
We don't have to wait.

3325
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:14,470
Yeah, I didn't see anybody at me for casting, so...

3326
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:24,060
I'm curious if they'll target ban you, Gomez.

3327
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:25,740
I feel like they will.

3328
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:27,660
Eh, nothing now.

3329
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:31,420
I think you've been target banned this entire... like, the last two teams.

3330
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:34,900
I'll have fun.

3331
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:35,900
Starlord.

3332
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:37,580
Starlord, yay!

3333
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:38,000
Starlord.

3334
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:43,080
You just couldn't go one game without banning Starlord.

3335
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:44,400
Oh, we do Rocket first, right?

3336
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,220
Rocket first?

3337
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:46,540
Yeah, we do Rocket first.

3338
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:48,000
I can't have what I want.

3339
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:49,640
This is so sad.

3340
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:53,220
Who are you protecting?

3341
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,580
Do we protect the thing, or...?

3342
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,780
No, they want Punisher.

3343
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:59,040
They want Punisher and Bucky a lot.

3344
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:02,220
If N gets banned, I'll play Mag.

3345
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:02,660
Your call.

3346
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:05,020
If you want to save Luna or whatever.

3347
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:05,770
Let's just...

3348
02:04:05,770 --> 02:04:08,270
We probably need Namor if they're going double dive, right?

3349
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:10,190
Yeah, let's just save Namor.

3350
02:04:10,330 --> 02:04:10,770
We can protect...

3351
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:12,810
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing.

3352
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:13,290
Thing, thing.

3353
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:13,770
Protect the thing.

3354
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:14,330
Thing, thing, thing, thing.

3355
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:15,810
Oh my goodness, bro.

3356
02:04:15,990 --> 02:04:17,150
Protect the thing.

3357
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:20,670
I was hearing, like, three different things, so I did not know.

3358
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:25,150
I heard Luna, Namor, then thing.

3359
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:27,290
So, we'll go based off of what their last ban is, okay?

3360
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:28,210
Yeah.

3361
02:04:29,010 --> 02:04:30,950
Whatever their last ban is, we can play off of it.

3362
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:34,050
They're not fucking banning me.

3363
02:04:35,070 --> 02:04:36,530
I mean, you play Wolverine.

3364
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:38,290
They protected Wolverine.

3365
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:39,910
Yeah, I'll just do that.

3366
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:43,570
No Luna, so they will have...

3367
02:04:43,570 --> 02:04:44,710
Okay, so...

3368
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:48,890
So, if we're basing off of that ban, we still have...

3369
02:04:48,890 --> 02:04:50,230
We'll go with Spider-Man.

3370
02:04:50,570 --> 02:04:51,370
Yeah, and Spidey.

3371
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:53,590
I think it would be better to ban Venom, though.

3372
02:04:53,710 --> 02:04:54,110
Oh, Venom?

3373
02:04:54,130 --> 02:04:54,410
Okay.

3374
02:04:54,650 --> 02:04:55,630
Jay's Venom is good, though.

3375
02:04:56,410 --> 02:04:57,210
Or, Jay, what do you want?

3376
02:04:57,310 --> 02:04:57,950
Venom or Strange?

3377
02:04:58,290 --> 02:04:58,770
Which one?

3378
02:05:00,170 --> 02:05:01,030
I'm feeling Strange.

3379
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:02,370
Spider, Spider, Spider.

3380
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:03,070
I'm banning Venom.

3381
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:04,090
I'm banning Venom, yeah.

3382
02:05:04,270 --> 02:05:04,450
No!

3383
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:05,830
Okay, it's okay, then.

3384
02:05:06,070 --> 02:05:06,270
It's okay.

3385
02:05:06,770 --> 02:05:08,890
Because he said Strange, I'm like, okay, he's feeling Strange, fine.

3386
02:05:09,910 --> 02:05:11,250
It's time to get Strange.

3387
02:05:11,730 --> 02:05:13,070
Alright, we go...

3388
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:18,170
I don't know if we should do Adam, too, because this team is a decent team.

3389
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:22,750
Are we attacking or defending?

3390
02:05:24,010 --> 02:05:25,270
We're defending first.

3391
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:28,270
I'll go Cloak first, then.

3392
02:05:29,230 --> 02:05:29,670
Alright.

3393
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:35,710
I don't know if we should go... yeah, I don't think Adam's too risky for this.

3394
02:05:36,290 --> 02:05:37,610
Especially that Wolverine.

3395
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:40,550
Nope, I'm ready.

3396
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:42,690
Wait, can you give me a Pax in the beginning?

3397
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:44,590
Yeah, I can, I can.

3398
02:05:45,130 --> 02:05:45,530
Okay.

3399
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:47,510
You can do the fly thing.

3400
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:50,630
Oh, my one time, I picked...

3401
02:05:50,630 --> 02:05:52,170
Oh, wait, we banned Rocket, idiot.

3402
02:05:52,610 --> 02:05:53,490
Oh, shit!

3403
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:56,510
We were the ones that banned Rocket.

3404
02:05:57,590 --> 02:05:58,370
Fuck, yeah.

3405
02:05:59,190 --> 02:06:00,770
I can't get the jump pack, though.

3406
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:02,750
But they don't have it, too.

3407
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:04,490
Okay, I have...

3408
02:06:04,490 --> 02:06:09,550
Based on how their Wolverine plays, I will probably... I might swap to Magneto.

3409
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:10,970
Yep.

3410
02:06:11,590 --> 02:06:11,810
Okay.

3411
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:12,750
Alright.

3412
02:06:15,010 --> 02:06:17,710
Mag should be the better pick here, since they're probably gonna go Pantheon.

3413
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:21,610
Yeah, I feel so as well, because if I get kidnapped, I'm gonna have like...

3414
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:26,690
The thing is, if they run Mag, I don't have shields.

3415
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:27,150
Yeah, strange.

3416
02:06:27,770 --> 02:06:28,410
They have Storm, yeah.

3417
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:31,230
I might just grab Storm out of the air if he flies up high enough.

3418
02:06:32,990 --> 02:06:33,510
Yeah, Thor.

3419
02:06:34,070 --> 02:06:35,150
I'm gonna walk in right now, okay?

3420
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:35,590
Oh, never mind.

3421
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:37,350
I think I'm gonna go... I'm gonna walk in now.

3422
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:38,490
I'm gonna go for a grab.

3423
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:41,790
Hook up their Wolverine, up top.

3424
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:43,630
Yeah, I'm looking for you, I'm looking for you.

3425
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:46,190
Watch out grab, watch out grab, watch out grab.

3426
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,930
Oh, fuck.

3427
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:48,930
I can't do any better, yeah.

3428
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:50,130
Yeah, it's my bad.

3429
02:06:50,690 --> 02:06:51,630
I'm going Mag already.

3430
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:53,010
Okay, yeah.

3431
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:54,530
I'm looking at Storm right now.

3432
02:06:56,350 --> 02:06:57,190
I missed my grab.

3433
02:06:57,370 --> 02:06:57,490
Oh!

3434
02:06:58,010 --> 02:06:59,190
I can't, yeah.

3435
02:06:59,190 --> 02:07:00,250
You haven't used your passive yet.

3436
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:00,950
Oh, Coney, watch out.

3437
02:07:01,190 --> 02:07:02,590
Just pocket Coney, pocket Coney.

3438
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:03,330
I'm trying, I'm trying.

3439
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:04,190
I tried to shift.

3440
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:05,510
They're doing a lot of fucking damage.

3441
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:06,070
Yeah.

3442
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:08,430
I'm trying to get Shurda out of here.

3443
02:07:09,070 --> 02:07:09,370
Yep.

3444
02:07:10,190 --> 02:07:12,130
I'm not sure what happened, I tried to shift out, but...

3445
02:07:12,930 --> 02:07:14,290
It might be better for me to just go Flylock.

3446
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:16,870
Actually...

3447
02:07:18,290 --> 02:07:19,170
They walk in.

3448
02:07:19,570 --> 02:07:20,850
We have to soon.

3449
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:22,470
Yeah, we gotta walk up.

3450
02:07:22,570 --> 02:07:23,230
Yeah, you gotta walk up.

3451
02:07:23,290 --> 02:07:24,450
You gotta walk up, you gotta walk up, you gotta walk up.

3452
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:26,570
Walk up, walk up, walk up, walk up, walk up, walk up.

3453
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:28,890
Yeah, we're on it, we're on it.

3454
02:07:29,230 --> 02:07:30,710
We have Lemons ult, we have Lemons ult.

3455
02:07:30,710 --> 02:07:32,250
Oh, they think I'm actually going to catch Flylock.

3456
02:07:32,990 --> 02:07:33,470
Don't use it, don't use it.

3457
02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:33,970
Yeah, I'm holding.

3458
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:35,670
No need to use any ults here.

3459
02:07:36,510 --> 02:07:37,530
Just regroup, regroup here.

3460
02:07:38,530 --> 02:07:40,370
Do we keep, do we keep the thing with us?

3461
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:41,630
I don't know if we should.

3462
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:42,210
It should be good.

3463
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:43,250
It should be good against the thing.

3464
02:07:43,670 --> 02:07:45,090
Or with the thing, it should be good against that.

3465
02:07:46,250 --> 02:07:49,070
I don't have ult, we have to use this to...

3466
02:07:49,070 --> 02:07:49,950
Here, here, here.

3467
02:07:51,590 --> 02:07:51,970
Nice.

3468
02:07:52,190 --> 02:07:52,470
It's fine.

3469
02:07:55,270 --> 02:07:56,290
I will here.

3470
02:07:56,650 --> 02:07:57,190
Stacked it.

3471
02:07:59,070 --> 02:08:00,170
Okay, I'm going to look for something.

3472
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:01,250
Okay.

3473
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:03,030
I can throw you in too.

3474
02:08:05,070 --> 02:08:06,070
I got ulted up.

3475
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:09,050
We have to use...

3476
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:09,630
What are we using?

3477
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:11,910
Their Wolf is going to ult, their Wolf is going to ult, watch out.

3478
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:12,530
Yeah.

3479
02:08:13,350 --> 02:08:13,650
Hold on.

3480
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:15,990
Now we can copy, we can copy that.

3481
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:16,750
Okay, alright.

3482
02:08:19,370 --> 02:08:21,210
I'm holding in a second.

3483
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:22,190
I have to dodge.

3484
02:08:22,650 --> 02:08:23,050
I got shields.

3485
02:08:23,190 --> 02:08:23,670
Oh, he's up, he's up.

3486
02:08:25,550 --> 02:08:25,870
Okay.

3487
02:08:26,150 --> 02:08:26,430
Sure.

3488
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:27,530
Got ult.

3489
02:08:28,670 --> 02:08:30,370
They, they, hold corner, hold corner, hold corner.

3490
02:08:30,930 --> 02:08:31,310
Hold corner.

3491
02:08:31,710 --> 02:08:33,050
Yeah, I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding.

3492
02:08:34,650 --> 02:08:34,970
Okay.

3493
02:08:35,230 --> 02:08:35,890
There's no support ult.

3494
02:08:35,970 --> 02:08:37,890
Now, can we, can we ult the corner with Shoto, Shoto?

3495
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:38,570
Yeah, yeah.

3496
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:40,530
I got, I got kidnapped, I got kidnapped.

3497
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:42,090
I...

3498
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:42,770
You should not hit me.

3499
02:08:43,290 --> 02:08:43,510
Yeah.

3500
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:47,890
We're all down.

3501
02:08:48,970 --> 02:08:49,450
I think...

3502
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:51,170
We have to change something up.

3503
02:08:51,650 --> 02:08:52,370
Yeah, we need a swap.

3504
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:54,070
We have to swap something.

3505
02:08:54,070 --> 02:08:56,490
Do you do trips, trip support, or this for, I don't know.

3506
02:08:56,610 --> 02:08:57,850
We can do triple, we can do triple support.

3507
02:08:58,270 --> 02:08:58,670
Then I go Bucky.

3508
02:08:58,910 --> 02:09:00,390
I feel like we don't have enough healing somehow.

3509
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:02,090
Can we, I don't know if we can touch this.

3510
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:03,410
We don't have ultimate.

3511
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:04,770
Oh, we can give it, we can give it.

3512
02:09:04,910 --> 02:09:05,490
Give it, okay, give it.

3513
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:06,870
JJ back up, JJ back up.

3514
02:09:07,150 --> 02:09:08,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, backing back up, backing back up.

3515
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:11,190
Because the only reason I didn't go Loki was because I was worried they had Bucky, sure.

3516
02:09:13,230 --> 02:09:13,710
Good swap.

3517
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:16,050
I don't think they have a Bucky player.

3518
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:18,130
We...

3519
02:09:18,130 --> 02:09:18,970
Oh, we have Limbo's ult.

3520
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:21,250
Let me, let me try and get her.

3521
02:09:21,330 --> 02:09:21,790
I have it, I have it.

3522
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:22,670
There you go, there you go.

3523
02:09:22,770 --> 02:09:24,930
Okay, nice.

3524
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:26,650
I am...

3525
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:27,790
Wolf down, wolf down, wolf down.

3526
02:09:28,150 --> 02:09:28,990
Thorin, Thorin, Thorin, Thorin, Thorin.

3527
02:09:29,590 --> 02:09:30,570
I'm pushing up, pushing up.

3528
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:31,830
Yeah.

3529
02:09:33,230 --> 02:09:33,630
Thorin one.

3530
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:35,350
Yeah, looking for it.

3531
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:39,410
I have dash in three, two, one, I'm gonna run in.

3532
02:09:41,090 --> 02:09:42,230
You're gonna be by yourself when you run in.

3533
02:09:42,410 --> 02:09:43,270
You're by yourself, you're by yourself.

3534
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:44,450
You can't E me, you can't E me, you can't E me.

3535
02:09:46,050 --> 02:09:47,830
Back up if you can, back up if you can, back up if you can.

3536
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:51,830
Right here, right here, right here on me.

3537
02:09:52,730 --> 02:09:54,050
I'm gonna pick him up, I'm gonna pick him up here.

3538
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:54,810
Nice, nice, nice.

3539
02:09:55,550 --> 02:09:56,030
They phased.

3540
02:09:58,130 --> 02:09:58,750
I don't know.

3541
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:00,970
I'm gonna use this to regroup.

3542
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:02,150
Yeah, we're still good.

3543
02:10:02,150 --> 02:10:03,090
Yeah, I'm pushing up, I'm pushing up.

3544
02:10:03,530 --> 02:10:04,510
Push up with this, push up with this.

3545
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:04,970
Yeah.

3546
02:10:08,450 --> 02:10:09,470
I have ult, one sec.

3547
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:10,690
I'm getting out, I'm getting out, I'm getting out.

3548
02:10:10,710 --> 02:10:11,550
Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.

3549
02:10:11,630 --> 02:10:12,610
I'm shielding, I'm shielding, I'm shielding.

3550
02:10:12,610 --> 02:10:14,550
I'm baiting, looking at, baiting out.

3551
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,050
I have no bubble, I have no bubble here.

3552
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:16,870
I'm gonna get back, I'm gonna get back.

3553
02:10:16,990 --> 02:10:17,650
Storm ult, Storm ult.

3554
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:19,270
I shifted, I shifted.

3555
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:21,610
Oh my god, he ulted!

3556
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:23,370
Use this, use this, use this, use this, use this, use this.

3557
02:10:24,050 --> 02:10:24,950
Wolf on, Wolf on, Wolf on.

3558
02:10:24,990 --> 02:10:25,430
I have both, I have both.

3559
02:10:26,490 --> 02:10:26,970
Oh fuck.

3560
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:29,930
It's fine, stay in the, stay in the cloak ult, stay in the cloak ult, stay in the cloak ult.

3561
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:31,550
Yeah, okay, yeah, I'm staying, I'm staying, I'm staying, I'm staying.

3562
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:32,370
Right here.

3563
02:10:32,670 --> 02:10:33,170
Okay, okay, okay.

3564
02:10:33,490 --> 02:10:33,930
I'm gonna storm, yeah.

3565
02:10:34,270 --> 02:10:35,170
Can we, can we kill Storm?

3566
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:36,130
We can, we can, we can, we can.

3567
02:10:36,130 --> 02:10:36,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3568
02:10:36,670 --> 02:10:37,730
He's portaled out, he's portaled out.

3569
02:10:37,810 --> 02:10:38,330
She's necked out.

3570
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:39,190
Yeah.

3571
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:42,210
We don't have any support ults and they have strange ult, they have strange ult and floor ult.

3572
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:42,630
Yeah.

3573
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:43,430
They have strange ult and floor ult.

3574
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:44,190
Lime has to build it up.

3575
02:10:44,190 --> 02:10:45,810
Lime, Lime, you should heal, Lime heal more.

3576
02:10:45,990 --> 02:10:47,370
Yeah, yeah, I'm letting her heal, I'm letting her heal.

3577
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:48,050
Yeah, yeah.

3578
02:10:48,370 --> 02:10:49,410
I'm letting her heal right now.

3579
02:10:49,570 --> 02:10:50,130
And then she can get a full charge.

3580
02:10:51,190 --> 02:10:51,750
Hold there.

3581
02:10:52,090 --> 02:10:52,790
I'm going right here, right here.

3582
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:53,010
Yeah.

3583
02:10:53,770 --> 02:10:54,310
Okay, she'll ult.

3584
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:55,670
There's nobody, there's nobody with him.

3585
02:10:57,010 --> 02:10:57,330
Lime?

3586
02:11:00,330 --> 02:11:02,670
Yeah, we need to be careful of the strange.

3587
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:04,630
They might portal, they might portal block.

3588
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:06,650
Just keep going.

3589
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:08,050
Don't hear it.

3590
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:08,830
Yeah, they didn't.

3591
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:11,770
I'm rocking right, Lime I'm off heat a little bit, so you heal me okay?

3592
02:11:11,850 --> 02:11:12,070
Okay.

3593
02:11:12,190 --> 02:11:13,330
Lime, Lime, Lime, come back, come back, come back, come back.

3594
02:11:14,290 --> 02:11:16,430
He's portaling, he's portaling, he's portaling, he's portaling, he's portaling.

3595
02:11:16,750 --> 02:11:18,170
Okay, now walk out, walk out, walk out.

3596
02:11:18,490 --> 02:11:19,030
And you got ult.

3597
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:20,910
You feel that, do you feel that?

3598
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:21,850
We got touch points here.

3599
02:11:22,950 --> 02:11:23,430
Oh fuck.

3600
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:24,390
I'm getting on point.

3601
02:11:24,510 --> 02:11:25,150
You feel it, you feel it feel it.

3602
02:11:25,410 --> 02:11:25,930
We're on, we're on.

3603
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:27,210
Yeah, I'm touching point, I'm touching point, I'm touching point.

3604
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:28,230
I'm on point, I'm on point.

3605
02:11:28,230 --> 02:11:31,010
Welcome to the Dark Force Dimension.

3606
02:11:32,270 --> 02:11:32,750
Disappear!

3607
02:11:35,550 --> 02:11:38,250
Oh my god, fuck.

3608
02:11:38,830 --> 02:11:42,410
Oh, I'm 96!

3609
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:44,710
Big clobber, big clobber, big clobber, big clobber!

3610
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:46,010
Fuck me!

3611
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:48,090
Oh my god, three people annoyed me.

3612
02:11:48,710 --> 02:11:49,950
I couldn't live there.

3613
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:53,090
I fucking slammed that and hit him.

3614
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:53,830
That's so sad.

3615
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:55,950
I don't know we should play this game.

3616
02:11:55,950 --> 02:11:57,630
We're being too aggressive a bit.

3617
02:12:00,330 --> 02:12:02,630
Yeah, I can swap to Mag if he wants to play Strange.

3618
02:12:02,630 --> 02:12:03,610
Yeah, I can swap to Strange, yeah.

3619
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:05,990
We have to change something.

3620
02:12:08,110 --> 02:12:10,510
Okay, I think Coney's playing a little too aggressive.

3621
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:12,830
Because the thing is you're supposed to be good against that.

3622
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:16,550
So we can probably just play around corners, Coney.

3623
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:18,570
Don't really do anything that intensive.

3624
02:12:19,210 --> 02:12:23,430
The thing is we have nothing to counter the Strange ult too.

3625
02:12:23,430 --> 02:12:27,530
Because the Strange gets a free ult on us every time.

3626
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:30,490
So we have nothing to shield us from the Strange.

3627
02:12:32,930 --> 02:12:34,010
Yeah, Mag is better.

3628
02:12:34,110 --> 02:12:34,670
Mag helps here.

3629
02:12:34,690 --> 02:12:35,090
Big problem.

3630
02:12:35,670 --> 02:12:35,950
Yeah.

3631
02:12:36,410 --> 02:12:38,290
Okay, so let's do that then.

3632
02:12:39,330 --> 02:12:39,610
It's good.

3633
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:40,630
Okay.

3634
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:41,190
Why not?

3635
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:49,130
Yeah, the Storm is definitely punishing Coney's thing.

3636
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:49,370
Yeah.

3637
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:56,060
Should be good running this though.

3638
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:02,560
We want, actually...

3639
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:04,420
Sue's good against that.

3640
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:06,080
We have the clones.

3641
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:08,140
Luke is good just mid-fight ult.

3642
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:12,840
We could...

3643
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:15,500
Okay, if you want to, you can go Mantis against that, but...

3644
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:15,940
Mantis?

3645
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:16,620
I can try.

3646
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:17,480
If you want, if you want.

3647
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:20,460
I don't really have the team up though.

3648
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:22,580
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.

3649
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:24,860
No, they do cloak, cloak, cloak, cloak.

3650
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:27,780
It's like the defensive ult, we need more defensive ults here.

3651
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:30,840
They literally have too many aggression ults for us.

3652
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:33,180
Yeah.

3653
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:37,140
I have the Storm.

3654
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:39,760
Hold them in.

3655
02:13:40,220 --> 02:13:41,120
Hold in there, hold in the Wolf.

3656
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:42,780
I'm, I, I blinded.

3657
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:43,620
Wolf no passive, no passive.

3658
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:47,280
See, look at that.

3659
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:50,280
Wolf play is a little, a little...

3660
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:53,040
A little... not aware.

3661
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:53,980
Okay, look at the, look at the...

3662
02:13:53,980 --> 02:13:54,480
Thor, Thor, Thor.

3663
02:13:55,140 --> 02:13:56,260
I blinded him, I blinded him again.

3664
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:57,200
No, no, no, no, no.

3665
02:13:57,980 --> 02:13:58,100
Yeah.

3666
02:13:58,500 --> 02:13:59,580
Okay, Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, Wolf.

3667
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:01,140
That's good, that's really good.

3668
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:02,320
I'm pushing, I'm pushing, I'm pushing, I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

3669
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:03,080
Ashe is three.

3670
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:04,280
Holding.

3671
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:05,720
Yeah, you guys push, I can heal, I can heal.

3672
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:06,480
I have no bubble, I have no bubble.

3673
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:07,500
Okay, Coney, but I'm with you, bro.

3674
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:08,400
I'm with you, I'm with you.

3675
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:09,340
Nice, big, big, big, big.

3676
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:10,240
Big, huge, huge, huge, huge.

3677
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:11,040
Push out, push out, push out, push out.

3678
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:11,820
Good job, good job, good job.

3679
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:12,440
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3680
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:12,900
That's an...

3681
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:13,660
I think...

3682
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:14,060
Do we chase?

3683
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:15,960
Okay, we're on point, we're on point.

3684
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:16,660
Yeah, yeah, it's fine, it's fine.

3685
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:17,620
Coney supports his pull.

3686
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:18,480
Pushing turret, it's fine.

3687
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:19,340
Can we portal this?

3688
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:20,160
I think we can do that.

3689
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:22,200
They're probably portal.

3690
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:26,080
They have no ults to actually...

3691
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:28,960
I blinded him, I blinded him, I blinded him.

3692
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:30,240
Nice, nice, nice.

3693
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:31,780
They ulted, they ulted.

3694
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:32,460
Yeah, yeah.

3695
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:34,040
I don't have any support ults here.

3696
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:34,680
I'm on a slam, I'm on a slam too here.

3697
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:35,240
Yeah.

3698
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:36,340
Uh...

3699
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:37,040
90% on shuriken.

3700
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:38,180
It's two, it's two.

3701
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:41,940
I'm getting blocked, I'm getting blocked.

3702
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:42,420
I'm done.

3703
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:44,480
Do we have any support ults?

3704
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:45,100
We should.

3705
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:46,580
Use slam, use slam.

3706
02:14:46,580 --> 02:14:46,940
Look at Coney.

3707
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:48,020
Look at Coney, look at Coney.

3708
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:48,780
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3709
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:49,680
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

3710
02:14:49,860 --> 02:14:50,240
I'm with you.

3711
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:50,940
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

3712
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,000
I'm on Bucky, I'm on Bucky, I'm on Bucky.

3713
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:54,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3714
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:54,940
Kill Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

3715
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:57,060
Wolverine, Wolverine, Wolverine, Wolverine.

3716
02:14:57,600 --> 02:14:58,220
Think, think, think, think, think.

3717
02:14:58,220 --> 02:14:58,700
Wolve, wolve, wolve, wolve.

3718
02:14:58,760 --> 02:14:59,020
Nice.

3719
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:00,280
Nice, good job.

3720
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:01,780
Holy fuck, that's good, that's good.

3721
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:01,900
Okay.

3722
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:03,600
And you guys still have both support ults?

3723
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:04,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3724
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:04,940
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

3725
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,140
They use, uh, they use cloak ult.

3726
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:08,760
How the fuck do you build it so fast?

3727
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:10,060
They have Captain America now.

3728
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:11,060
You ulted so quick, bro.

3729
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:12,540
They have strange ult here, so...

3730
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:12,880
Holy shit.

3731
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:15,800
I ulted at the same time as them, to be honest.

3732
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:16,520
I guess it makes sense.

3733
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:17,920
Do you want me to try and ult the strange ult?

3734
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:19,800
Uh, yeah, yeah.

3735
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:21,340
It's better for you to ult the strange ult.

3736
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:22,300
Check corners, check corners.

3737
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:24,940
You play further back then if they're gonna...

3738
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:26,260
because then he might try to ult you.

3739
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:27,480
Captain America, Captain America.

3740
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:28,260
On the left, on the left.

3741
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:28,680
Captain America.

3742
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:29,940
Okay.

3743
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:32,860
Do you want to do a little bit more dives?

3744
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:34,900
I could, I could aggressive ult this.

3745
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:35,380
Actually.

3746
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:37,940
Kappa's one.

3747
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,220
I'm gonna do this, I'm Kappa.

3748
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:41,400
Yeah.

3749
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:45,720
Nice.

3750
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:46,840
Nice, fuck, he's dead.

3751
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:47,900
Okay, he fell, he fucked up.

3752
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:49,220
He fucked up so hard, nice.

3753
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:50,820
Yeah, look at this thing.

3754
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:51,960
Strange, strange, strange, strange.

3755
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:53,260
Go for front lines, front lines.

3756
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:53,880
Yeah, yeah, go, go, go.

3757
02:15:54,220 --> 02:15:54,900
That feels really good.

3758
02:15:55,220 --> 02:15:55,980
Fuck off, strange.

3759
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:56,500
What the hell?

3760
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:58,120
She's one!

3761
02:15:59,120 --> 02:15:59,400
Boom!

3762
02:15:59,400 --> 02:15:59,860
Nice.

3763
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:00,880
Good job.

3764
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:04,300
Alright, they have, you have to ult the strange ult first.

3765
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:04,440
I got one.

3766
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:05,680
Yeah.

3767
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:06,540
Yeah.

3768
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:07,760
I got ulted for this.

3769
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:10,500
Push car, push car, push car.

3770
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:11,040
Get my cramped tank.

3771
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:12,380
Best ult.

3772
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:14,820
The best ult in the world.

3773
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:16,520
I have ult for this.

3774
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,520
I'm gonna try and see if I can flip the strange.

3775
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:21,120
Oh, I'm slept.

3776
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:22,600
Fuck, oh, they slept me.

3777
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:24,160
Use ult.

3778
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:25,520
Nice, I'm down.

3779
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:26,820
I got slept.

3780
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:30,020
Alright, we just play around corner, play around corner.

3781
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:30,600
We don't have to push it.

3782
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:33,300
I'm pulling back, I'm pulling back, I'm pulling back.

3783
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:36,820
If he feeds, I can ult this.

3784
02:16:37,580 --> 02:16:37,820
Nevermind.

3785
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:39,280
I have E, yes.

3786
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:40,800
I have ult soon, I have ult soon, I have ult soon.

3787
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:41,520
I'm pulling back, I'm pulling back.

3788
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:45,440
It's not strange, by the way.

3789
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:47,060
No, they used it.

3790
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:47,500
Oh, they used it?

3791
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:48,280
Yeah, they used it.

3792
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:51,980
I got fucking kidnapped.

3793
02:16:52,220 --> 02:16:52,980
I have to kill myself.

3794
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:55,260
I can ult this, I can ult this.

3795
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:56,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3796
02:16:56,260 --> 02:16:58,600
I have his ult, I have his ult.

3797
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:00,400
Yeah, I blinded them.

3798
02:17:00,660 --> 02:17:02,460
I'm pulling back, I pulled in their Mantis.

3799
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:04,260
I'm pulling them in, I'm pulling them in.

3800
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:08,700
I think we just die, we just full die.

3801
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:10,000
Oh, shit.

3802
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:12,000
I was going to say, we should full die.

3803
02:17:12,060 --> 02:17:13,420
Just full die, just full die, don't use anything.

3804
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:13,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3805
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:18,520
I'm doing my pulls too early for my shift.

3806
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:20,000
What am I doing?

3807
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:25,100
Can't do this on your actual tournament, Gomez.

3808
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:27,820
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

3809
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:33,060
Their Mantis ulted.

3810
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:36,120
They have strange ult soon, I think.

3811
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:37,920
Yeah, they do have ult soon as well.

3812
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:40,420
Did they use a thing ult?

3813
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:41,580
No.

3814
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,540
No, no, they'll have it.

3815
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:46,820
I got ult up.

3816
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:50,620
You can go behind them and ult them if you want.

3817
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:51,620
Alright, I'm going to do it.

3818
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:52,420
Yeah, yeah, I'm going behind.

3819
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,100
One second.

3820
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:54,900
Doki, am I ulting first or you?

3821
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:55,540
I'm ulting first.

3822
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:56,600
Walk in, walk in, walk in hard.

3823
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:58,020
Yeah, yeah, go, go, go.

3824
02:17:58,040 --> 02:17:58,620
Look for it, look for it.

3825
02:17:58,660 --> 02:17:59,000
Go, go, go.

3826
02:18:00,140 --> 02:18:01,120
Oh my god, you actually got him.

3827
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:01,680
Wait, Mantis, Mantis.

3828
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:02,280
Oh my god.

3829
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:03,940
I'm shielding you.

3830
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:05,200
It's 6v5.

3831
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:05,760
Get 6v5.

3832
02:18:06,260 --> 02:18:06,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3833
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:07,520
Pulling.

3834
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:12,000
I'm using it, I'm using it, I'm using it, I'm using it.

3835
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:12,740
We have ult, we have ult.

3836
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:14,240
How the fuck did he get...

3837
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:15,560
Monkey one, monkey one, monkey one, monkey one.

3838
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:17,780
I have to go for Mantis.

3839
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:18,160
Yeah, Mantis.

3840
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:19,340
Okay, Mantis, Mantis, Mantis.

3841
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,140
We're killing Ice.

3842
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:21,700
I got you, I got you, I got you.

3843
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:22,660
Good job, good job, good job.

3844
02:18:23,060 --> 02:18:23,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3845
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:23,940
Good job, good job, good job.

3846
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:24,100
Nice.

3847
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:24,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3848
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:26,140
Walk it, yeah, walk it, walk it.

3849
02:18:26,180 --> 02:18:27,000
Yeah, walk it, walk it.

3850
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:27,860
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

3851
02:18:28,040 --> 02:18:28,480
Fuck this guy.

3852
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:29,220
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3853
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,740
I think that was probably worth...

3854
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:31,520
He kind of ran through everyone.

3855
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:32,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3856
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:34,220
I went aggression ult that.

3857
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:36,760
Because I knew we had the advantage there.

3858
02:18:37,580 --> 02:18:38,260
Yeah, that's fair.

3859
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:40,920
I still have my ult because it felt weird just to do it for myself.

3860
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:41,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3861
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:42,400
They used...

3862
02:18:42,400 --> 02:18:43,900
Use yours as the first defensive ult.

3863
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:48,200
Strange not high ground.

3864
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:49,760
I'm pushing turret first.

3865
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:52,380
Fuck, he's alone.

3866
02:18:54,780 --> 02:18:55,820
They have Adam now, by the way.

3867
02:18:56,420 --> 02:18:56,940
They have Adam.

3868
02:18:57,140 --> 02:18:57,360
Okay.

3869
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:00,660
I'll run a Korean comp.

3870
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:01,400
Korean comp.

3871
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:03,520
Okay, no pull.

3872
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:05,800
But maybe they're not that good at it.

3873
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,480
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3874
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:07,260
Push up, push up.

3875
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:09,180
Push this, push this, push this.

3876
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:09,660
Let's get active.

3877
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:10,160
Get active here.

3878
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:11,360
Get active, bro, get active.

3879
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:11,700
Yeah, yeah.

3880
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:12,840
I'm going in.

3881
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:14,200
Nice, nice, nice.

3882
02:19:14,220 --> 02:19:15,080
Oh my god, it's getting active.

3883
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:15,940
Nice, nice.

3884
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:16,860
Oh my god, Cody.

3885
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,540
Shit, block.

3886
02:19:20,540 --> 02:19:21,600
Adam rezzing in between us.

3887
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:22,440
Oh my god, I hit nothing, bro.

3888
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:26,320
They have aggression ults for us.

3889
02:19:26,660 --> 02:19:27,180
They have strange ults?

3890
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:27,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3891
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:28,940
Yeah, I'm backing up, backing up.

3892
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:29,940
Wait, I built Tracer.

3893
02:19:30,300 --> 02:19:30,880
Yeah, Tracer, Tracer, Tracer.

3894
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:32,040
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3895
02:19:32,220 --> 02:19:32,800
Reset, reset, reset.

3896
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:34,020
I got you, I got you.

3897
02:19:34,020 --> 02:19:34,700
Oh, they ulted, they ulted.

I'm coming out, I'm coming out.

3900
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:37,200
Careful, Kuni.

3901
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:37,960
Yep.

3902
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:38,880
I pulled the moon, I pulled the moon.

3903
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:40,120
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3904
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:41,340
That's such a big pick.

3905
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,620
I got shields, okay, I got shields.

3906
02:19:43,660 --> 02:19:44,300
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

3907
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:44,820
Fuck, fuck, you what?

3908

Big thing, ulted, big thing is ulted.

Big thing is ulted.

I'm using it, I'm using it.

02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:54,380
Getting backup, getting backup.

3914
02:19:54,580 --> 02:19:55,620

I'm with you.

3917
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,760
Focus change, focus change, focus change.

3918
02:20:01,820 --> 02:20:02,260
Watch out.

3919
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:04,700
Med this one, med this one.

3920
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:06,160
Strange low, strange low.

3921
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:07,100
Nice, nice, nice.

3922
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:07,440
Strange is dead.

3923
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:08,820
Trans right here, ting, ting.

3924
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:11,520
Focus strange, focus on it, focus on it.

3925
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:12,840
Nice, nice.

3926
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:13,900
Nice job.

3927
02:20:13,900 --> 02:20:15,700
Holy shit!

3928
02:20:15,700 --> 02:20:16,480
Oh my god!

3929
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:18,860
He's getting active on the pen!

3930
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:21,120
Holy shit.

3931
02:20:21,820 --> 02:20:24,040
Cody, you're doing fucking fantastic right now.

3932
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:24,720
Yeah, yeah.

3933
02:20:25,220 --> 02:20:28,540
When you start playing pass it, like more or less aggression is really good.

3934
02:20:29,660 --> 02:20:30,460
No, no.

3935
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:33,060
Let's do it again, one more time.

3936
02:20:34,120 --> 02:20:35,220
You know what, you're doing fantastic.

3937
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:38,900
You just lit up my chat.

3938
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:43,060
I was doing the same thing over there.

3939
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:44,020
The brain cell.

3940
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:49,520
I think when I have cloak off first, I'm just going to use it as an aggressional.

3941
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:51,580
I think that has been working out for us.

3942
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:52,400
Yes.

3943
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:53,560
Yeah, I like that.

3944
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:54,120
I like it.

3945
02:20:54,220 --> 02:20:54,640
I like it.

3946
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:55,040
Yeah.

3947
02:20:56,020 --> 02:20:58,740
We'll use the Loki and the Invisible Man's defensive.

3948
02:21:04,790 --> 02:21:06,530
I thought their Bucky would be more of a problem.

3949
02:21:06,670 --> 02:21:07,510
It doesn't seem like it.

3950
02:21:07,510 --> 02:21:09,070
I think he like...

3951
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:11,390
Missed.

3952
02:21:11,610 --> 02:21:12,770
Blessed him in the face.

3953
02:21:12,950 --> 02:21:15,190
Their Wolverine storm was the problem.

3954
02:21:16,090 --> 02:21:16,270
Yeah.

3955
02:21:16,710 --> 02:21:19,150
It's just the thing hard counters the Wolverine.

3956
02:21:19,510 --> 02:21:19,730
Yeah.

3957
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:22,690
If you just shift, he can't grab you.

3958
02:21:22,770 --> 02:21:23,770
And if you press shift, he can't move.

3959
02:21:25,290 --> 02:21:26,990
And if I pull him, he can't move anymore.

3960
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:29,690
He just can't move against us.

3961
02:21:32,630 --> 02:21:35,070
We should be popping off now.

3962
02:21:35,070 --> 02:21:37,190
We got less than...

3963
02:21:37,190 --> 02:21:38,970
We're a minute down, but I think that's fine.

3964
02:21:39,690 --> 02:21:40,090
Yeah.

3965
02:21:40,910 --> 02:21:42,890
We just have to have a really good push.

3966
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:44,690
Yeah, have a good push.

3967
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:46,210
And then we hold super well.

3968
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:48,870
Careful.

3969
02:21:51,470 --> 02:21:52,010
That's him.

3970
02:21:52,570 --> 02:21:53,350
Yeah, Moon Knight.

3971
02:21:54,870 --> 02:21:55,270
Nice.

3972
02:21:57,570 --> 02:21:58,310
He's still one there.

3973
02:21:59,530 --> 02:21:59,910
Oh my god.

3974
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:01,090
I'm lucky.

3975
02:22:01,090 --> 02:22:01,630
It's okay.

3976
02:22:02,290 --> 02:22:02,970
They have Groot.

3977
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:05,650
Hold them in.

3978
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:08,210
Groot can die.

3979
02:22:09,310 --> 02:22:09,890
He was so close.

3980
02:22:14,250 --> 02:22:16,130
They might get Moon Knight ult on us.

3981
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:18,310
Yeah, they might have Moon Knight ult.

3982
02:22:18,390 --> 02:22:18,650
Be careful.

3983
02:22:22,610 --> 02:22:23,510
They're going to have it soon, I think.

3984
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:26,870
I'm not building ult fast enough.

3985
02:22:26,990 --> 02:22:27,550
Hold them in again.

3986
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:32,910
Hold them in.

3987
02:22:33,330 --> 02:22:34,190
I have ult soon.

3988
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:35,810
I can't skin it.

3989
02:22:39,070 --> 02:22:39,730
Hold them in again.

3990
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:42,650
I'm out.

3991
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:43,630
I'm out of it.

3992
02:22:45,970 --> 02:22:47,410
We have support ult coming in.

3993
02:22:48,050 --> 02:22:48,690
I'm using it.

3994
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:49,130
I got it.

3995
02:22:50,590 --> 02:22:51,170
Big fight.

3996
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:52,470
Let's focus up.

3997
02:22:56,510 --> 02:22:57,270
They're going to have Groot ult.

3998
02:22:57,970 --> 02:22:58,930
We have to prepare for that.

3999
02:22:58,930 --> 02:23:00,570
Yeah, we play back.

4000
02:23:00,890 --> 02:23:03,270
We have to prepare for Groot ult.

4001
02:23:03,630 --> 02:23:04,410
I ulted.

4002
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:08,410
I can't fucking kill them.

4003
02:23:08,510 --> 02:23:08,870
I have ult.

4004
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:10,930
I pulled in Moon Knight.

4005
02:23:12,930 --> 02:23:13,570
Oh no.

4006
02:23:15,950 --> 02:23:17,550
I can't kill anything yet.

4007
02:23:17,890 --> 02:23:18,870
We'll just survive.

4008
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:21,610
I'm coming.

4009
02:23:26,610 --> 02:23:27,750
I'm waiting here.

4010
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:28,470
I'm waiting here.

4011
02:23:29,490 --> 02:23:30,250
I'm touching point.

4012
02:23:31,090 --> 02:23:32,350
I'm sitting on it.

4013
02:23:33,330 --> 02:23:35,010
Pop it.

4014
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:38,190
Zoning.

4015
02:23:38,910 --> 02:23:40,450
Keep zoning up.

4016
02:23:41,930 --> 02:23:44,210
I got Moon.

4017
02:23:45,230 --> 02:23:46,550
I pulled in their tank.

4018
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:48,550
I'm touching point.

4019
02:23:49,150 --> 02:23:50,230
I'm staying on point.

4020
02:23:51,010 --> 02:23:51,410
Storm one.

4021
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:54,450
I'm one.

4022
02:23:55,230 --> 02:23:56,450
Yeah, we don't have...

4023
02:23:58,210 --> 02:23:59,390
They stacked ults.

4024
02:24:00,270 --> 02:24:02,150
What do we do for this?

4025
02:24:02,890 --> 02:24:04,640
If they're running this, I don't know if we should run...

4026
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:06,250
the thing.

4027
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:06,910
I don't know.

4028
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:10,290
I'm down to swap to Strange.

4029
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:11,350
Do you want Strange back?

4030
02:24:13,890 --> 02:24:14,350
Uh...

4031
02:24:14,350 --> 02:24:14,710
Can I?

4032
02:24:14,990 --> 02:24:16,690
They don't have Rocket.

4033
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:21,610
If they're going to run Moon Knight and Groot, we can't run Loki.

4034
02:24:21,610 --> 02:24:23,070
Because they're just farming our clones.

4035
02:24:27,190 --> 02:24:28,150
You know what?

4036
02:24:28,270 --> 02:24:30,010
We could pull out our old classic.

4037
02:24:30,590 --> 02:24:31,630
We could pull out the triple tank.

4038
02:24:31,810 --> 02:24:33,330
And just hold our own corner the entire time.

4039
02:24:35,550 --> 02:24:38,010
Right now, we're not playing...

4040
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:38,170
What?

4041
02:24:40,590 --> 02:24:41,130
I'm thinking...

4042
02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:42,130
Because they can also go Groot.

4043
02:24:44,190 --> 02:24:45,570
I still want to keep the thing.

4044
02:24:45,730 --> 02:24:46,830
Because it's super easy.

4045
02:24:47,270 --> 02:24:48,690
Super easy to hold their own corners.

4046
02:24:49,110 --> 02:24:50,850
I'm going to play solo Wolverine.

4047
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:52,990
We just play super patient.

4048
02:24:53,290 --> 02:24:54,410
We just rotate ults.

4049
02:24:54,550 --> 02:24:56,870
They're going to try to push into us.

4050
02:24:57,050 --> 02:24:59,510
Should I still be Loki and just be more spread?

4051
02:24:59,930 --> 02:25:00,270
Yeah.

4052
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:02,690
We're going to use...

4053
02:25:02,690 --> 02:25:05,530
We're going to use Doki's ult for more of an engage.

4054
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:09,170
Then, Shadow, you can copy Limeu's whenever they come in.

4055
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:10,110
Yeah.

4056
02:25:10,190 --> 02:25:11,590
I'm just worried about Storm, too.

4057
02:25:11,810 --> 02:25:12,790
And Moon Knight ult, though.

4058
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:15,730
I think Shadow should copy me.

4059
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:17,910
Yeah, I want to copy Doki's ult.

4060
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:18,750
Yeah, copy me.

4061
02:25:18,850 --> 02:25:21,170
Because they'll just Moon Knight the ult.

4062
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:22,090
Okay.

4063
02:25:23,270 --> 02:25:25,610
You have to play more passive here.

4064
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:27,370
Do not be aggressive.

4065
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:28,470
Do not be aggressive.

4066
02:25:29,150 --> 02:25:31,630
Just play our support ult and just play off the time.

4067
02:25:31,770 --> 02:25:32,290
That's all we're doing.

4068
02:25:32,750 --> 02:25:35,490
I play my pulls, and then we just play around corner.

4069
02:25:36,110 --> 02:25:36,530
That's all we do.

4070
02:25:39,810 --> 02:25:42,830
Gomez, we lose this against them.

4071
02:25:42,910 --> 02:25:43,870
You have to play loser bracket.

4072
02:25:44,270 --> 02:25:45,190
I do, I know.

4073
02:25:45,750 --> 02:25:46,490
I'll tell them.

4074
02:25:49,430 --> 02:25:50,950
Okay, I'm going to look for a grab here.

4075
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:52,230
Whenever they walk in a little bit.

4076
02:25:52,750 --> 02:25:53,150
I'm looking.

4077
02:25:54,550 --> 02:25:55,490
I pulled in the Moon Knight.

4078
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:58,970
Yeah, I used blind already.

4079
02:25:59,970 --> 02:26:01,250
I got it.

4080
02:26:01,710 --> 02:26:02,490
Go to the wall.

4081
02:26:04,070 --> 02:26:04,650
The wall's open.

4082
02:26:06,530 --> 02:26:07,710
Yeah, I'm going to look for a play.

4083
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:09,470
For a grab.

4084
02:26:11,110 --> 02:26:11,730
I'm here.

4085
02:26:11,730 --> 02:26:11,990
I'm here.

4086
02:26:13,370 --> 02:26:15,310
You used your passive, so you have to play more.

4087
02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:17,610
I'm playing super passive.

4088
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:19,550
You're walled.

4089
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:20,010
Tank's walled.

4090
02:26:23,170 --> 02:26:25,070
He might have Moon Knight ult.

4091
02:26:26,330 --> 02:26:27,130
He's going to have that.

4092
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:28,210
I think I'm blind.

4093
02:26:29,550 --> 02:26:30,150
I hit three.

4094
02:26:31,230 --> 02:26:33,130
We have to push on point.

4095
02:26:34,210 --> 02:26:34,770
We have Luna.

4096
02:26:35,310 --> 02:26:36,930
I'm going to come back with strength.

4097
02:26:39,470 --> 02:26:40,330
We have second ult.

4098
02:26:41,390 --> 02:26:42,470
I don't have it yet.

4099
02:26:45,170 --> 02:26:45,810
I'm 97.

4100
02:26:46,690 --> 02:26:48,070
I got it.

4101
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:50,030
I have TP.

4102
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:51,910
They're going to ult me.

4103
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:53,590
Storm killed me.

4104
02:27:01,450 --> 02:27:02,210
You're walled up.

4105
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:06,410
Look at Moon Knight.

4106
02:27:06,410 --> 02:27:07,370
Yeah, I'm looking.

4107
02:27:08,650 --> 02:27:09,990
I'm on it.

4108
02:27:09,990 --> 02:27:11,330
I'm trying my best to heal you guys.

4109
02:27:13,770 --> 02:27:15,170
Look at their supports, okay?

4110
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:28,010
We have no support ults.

4111
02:27:29,190 --> 02:27:30,790
We need to get picks here.

4112
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:31,990
Three, two, one.

4113
02:27:32,350 --> 02:27:32,990
Nice.

4114
02:27:34,550 --> 02:27:34,870
Nice.

4115
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:38,250
Come back.

4116
02:27:39,150 --> 02:27:40,390
We have no support ults here.

4117
02:27:40,830 --> 02:27:41,470
Look.

4118
02:27:41,930 --> 02:27:44,010
We play around with support ults, okay?

4119
02:27:44,490 --> 02:27:45,750
We don't have any.

4120
02:27:48,510 --> 02:27:49,810
You're walled up.

4121
02:27:49,850 --> 02:27:50,490
Careful.

4122
02:27:53,850 --> 02:27:54,490
GG.

4123
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:57,210
That's fine.

4124
02:27:57,210 --> 02:27:57,710
Oh, shit.

4125
02:27:59,070 --> 02:28:00,030
We lost two.

4126
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:01,930
Oh, no.

4127
02:28:02,130 --> 02:28:02,830
I'm dead.

4128
02:28:04,770 --> 02:28:05,650
It's up to you.

4129
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:06,950
Huge!

4130
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:09,010
Oh, no.

4131
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:11,610
They're all fucking low.

4132
02:28:13,170 --> 02:28:15,110
Jay backed into the ball.

4133
02:28:15,330 --> 02:28:15,870
That's my bad.

4134
02:28:16,310 --> 02:28:17,670
I didn't know I had to go to the right.

4135
02:28:18,450 --> 02:28:20,430
We were so close.

4136
02:28:21,310 --> 02:28:21,970
That's my bad.

4137
02:28:23,130 --> 02:28:23,930
I'll just range.

4138
02:28:23,930 --> 02:28:24,550
Fuck that.

4139
02:28:24,690 --> 02:28:25,290
Oh, my god.

4140
02:28:25,550 --> 02:28:28,130
Oh, my lord.

4141
02:28:29,630 --> 02:28:33,870
If we do get 1-1 with them, we have a tiebreaker.

4142
02:28:34,630 --> 02:28:35,950
I don't know who wins.

4143
02:28:36,130 --> 02:28:41,430
Yeah, because if we do 1-1, if we win the next one, I don't know who's going to go to the winner's bracket.

4144
02:28:44,650 --> 02:28:45,570
We just do.

4145
02:28:47,410 --> 02:28:49,850
The thing is, do we run in battle here?

4146
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:51,310
Or...

4147
02:28:51,310 --> 02:28:52,970
Up to you.

4148
02:28:53,790 --> 02:28:55,390
Is everyone battle here?

4149
02:28:55,590 --> 02:28:57,730
I think battle can be our mag.

4150
02:29:01,930 --> 02:29:02,690
We can try that.

4151
02:29:03,310 --> 02:29:03,910
Okay.

4152
02:29:04,690 --> 02:29:05,410
Goodbye, duck.

4153
02:29:05,550 --> 02:29:06,170
Sorry, Shoto.

4154
02:29:07,050 --> 02:29:07,630
No duck.

4155
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:09,510
Oh, duck.

4156
02:29:11,110 --> 02:29:11,710
Lucky.

4157
02:29:14,150 --> 02:29:14,450
Alright.

4158
02:29:15,310 --> 02:29:16,110
What's the next one?

4159
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:17,690
Symbiotic.

4160
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:19,050
Do we just run 3-3 then?

4161
02:29:20,230 --> 02:29:20,630
For this?

4162
02:29:20,730 --> 02:29:21,210
For this team?

4163
02:29:21,630 --> 02:29:21,870
Okay.

4164
02:29:23,890 --> 02:29:26,130
Oh, shit.

4165
02:29:26,190 --> 02:29:26,770
I just started for no reason.

4166
02:29:27,150 --> 02:29:28,750
What the fuck?

4167
02:29:29,470 --> 02:29:30,070
Hold on.

4168
02:29:30,130 --> 02:29:30,430
Hold on.

4169
02:29:30,570 --> 02:29:30,630
Hold on.

4170
02:29:31,170 --> 02:29:31,810
Everyone leave.

4171
02:29:33,330 --> 02:29:33,750
Leave.

4172
02:29:36,730 --> 02:29:37,570
Scrim moment.

4173
02:29:37,890 --> 02:29:38,190
Sorry.

4174
02:29:41,850 --> 02:29:44,510
I usually just insta-put us in if it's a scrim.

4175
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:46,110
Whoopsie.

4176
02:29:47,930 --> 02:29:48,350
Okay.

4177
02:29:50,350 --> 02:29:52,190
Oh, sub's into my support.

4178
02:29:52,190 --> 02:29:52,950
Battle's gonna play mag.

4179
02:29:53,930 --> 02:29:54,230
Alright.

4180
02:29:57,910 --> 02:29:58,650
Oh, yeah.

4181
02:29:59,690 --> 02:30:00,330
Oh, yeah.

4182
02:30:00,350 --> 02:30:01,210
We're running back up.

4183
02:30:01,650 --> 02:30:03,690
Hello, hello.

4184
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:04,690
Close, guys.

4185
02:30:04,990 --> 02:30:06,050
That was so close.

4186
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:06,810
Yeah, it was.

4187
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:09,770
We had like...

4188
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:10,210
Oh, my god.

4189
02:30:10,230 --> 02:30:11,430
Our support was so close.

4190
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:14,670
From Zo.

4191
02:30:16,650 --> 02:30:17,210
Yeah, it sucked.

4192
02:30:17,370 --> 02:30:19,650
I got separated by the moon.

4193
02:30:20,050 --> 02:30:20,950
Yeah, I tried to heal.

4194
02:30:21,070 --> 02:30:23,050
I backed to the...

4195
02:30:23,050 --> 02:30:28,810
I was the only one that backed fully up because I was too far for it to back into you guys.

4196
02:30:29,370 --> 02:30:32,090
Yeah, I had to swerve to the right and Magneto was like, hello there.

4197
02:30:33,810 --> 02:30:34,410
I'm lucky.

4198
02:30:34,990 --> 02:30:36,450
I think we should run 3-3 then.

4199
02:30:36,730 --> 02:30:39,090
And then, Gomez, you should be on Strange.

4200
02:30:40,590 --> 02:30:41,010
Down.

4201
02:30:42,690 --> 02:30:44,210
I am completely down.

4202
02:30:44,350 --> 02:30:45,100
Can you swap?

4203
02:30:46,550 --> 02:30:46,830
Oh, yeah.

4204
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:51,090
I can't move their spectator.

4205
02:30:53,790 --> 02:30:55,050
Wait, I can't move him.

4206
02:30:55,550 --> 02:30:55,810
What?

4207
02:30:56,190 --> 02:30:57,370
No, he can move himself.

4208
02:30:58,970 --> 02:31:00,850
Usually, I can move him, but he's not like me.

4209
02:31:02,190 --> 02:31:02,590
I'm lucky.

4210
02:31:15,390 --> 02:31:17,090
So, is this like a Swiss style?

4211
02:31:17,470 --> 02:31:18,930
I thought we played 5 teams.

4212
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:19,910
So, what happens here?

4213
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:22,370
Oh, we play 4 teams.

4214
02:31:23,030 --> 02:31:28,490
If we get 1-1, it goes to tiebreaker, but I don't know how the tiebreaker works.

4215
02:31:31,510 --> 02:31:36,770
If they win the tiebreaker, if they win the tiebreaker, we go to loser's round.

4216
02:31:37,570 --> 02:31:38,190
I see, okay.

4217
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:41,350
Nice.

4218
02:31:42,430 --> 02:31:43,190
I see, okay.

4219
02:31:44,150 --> 02:31:50,910
Let me tell them maybe an hour after...

4220
02:31:50,910 --> 02:31:52,590
No, it's a long one.

4221
02:31:52,930 --> 02:31:54,210
We have like several games.

4222
02:31:54,570 --> 02:31:56,370
Like 3-4 games.

4223
02:31:57,550 --> 02:31:58,710
Okay, let me ask if they're ready.

4224
02:31:59,670 --> 02:32:00,210
Oh, nevermind.

4225
02:32:02,730 --> 02:32:03,690
They said one sec.

4226
02:32:10,310 --> 02:32:12,970
I don't know if we should go Adam with our 3-3.

4227
02:32:15,650 --> 02:32:20,050
Do you think Adam is still okay with 3-3, or do we...

4228
02:32:20,050 --> 02:32:21,230
It usually is.

4229
02:32:21,450 --> 02:32:22,090
Should be good.

4230
02:32:22,750 --> 02:32:26,770
I'll go in with Adam then and see how it goes.

4231
02:32:32,310 --> 02:32:34,710
It's either that, or we can do...

4232
02:32:34,710 --> 02:32:40,030
If we want you on cloak, if we still want to run the cloak, or if we're doing the Sue, I don't know.

4233
02:32:40,950 --> 02:32:48,990
Could run the Adamantus Loki, or the Sue Loki Adam.

4234
02:32:48,990 --> 02:32:49,990
Depends.

4235
02:32:50,750 --> 02:32:51,410
What's your opinion?

4236
02:32:51,710 --> 02:32:54,110
You're the most experienced against this team.

4237
02:32:54,470 --> 02:32:55,590
I think...

4238
02:32:56,530 --> 02:32:58,250
Okay, we're obviously going to ban Groot.

4239
02:32:58,850 --> 02:33:01,070
They pulled out the cheesy shit.

4240
02:33:01,430 --> 02:33:02,830
I don't care if they pull out Venom.

4241
02:33:02,970 --> 02:33:04,050
I'm going to be completely real.

4242
02:33:05,730 --> 02:33:08,010
We can just ban out the Groots.

4243
02:33:08,330 --> 02:33:09,950
We can just do...

4244
02:33:09,950 --> 02:33:11,990
We don't need to ban Rocket.

4245
02:33:12,490 --> 02:33:12,910
I don't think.

4246
02:33:14,630 --> 02:33:16,450
They want to do cheesy stuff.

4247
02:33:16,450 --> 02:33:18,790
I think maybe the Rocket ban would still be better.

4248
02:33:19,570 --> 02:33:20,690
Just do Groot Rocket then.

4249
02:33:21,410 --> 02:33:21,810
Yeah.

4250
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:24,430
This is a cheesy team.

4251
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:27,070
I mean, they ban Luna.

4252
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:30,270
Do we have lack of defensible for their cheese?

4253
02:33:31,530 --> 02:33:32,910
Yep, that's what they're going for.

4254
02:33:34,530 --> 02:33:35,870
I think we should protect...

4255
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:40,830
I think we should protect Mag then, right?

4256
02:33:42,190 --> 02:33:42,850
Uh, yep.

4257
02:33:43,250 --> 02:33:43,590
Okay.

4258
02:33:43,590 --> 02:33:44,490
We'll just do that.

4259
02:33:46,730 --> 02:33:49,750
They're coming up with strats right now against us.

4260
02:33:52,250 --> 02:33:53,530
Thinking too much.

4261
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:12,090
I'm a little sad.

4262
02:34:13,390 --> 02:34:14,270
It was so winnable.

4263
02:34:14,450 --> 02:34:16,870
It was just little mistakes here and there.

4264
02:34:17,950 --> 02:34:20,770
It was really just little mistakes.

4265
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:26,770
Honestly, I think we definitely should have swapped stuff earlier during attack.

4266
02:34:26,770 --> 02:34:28,030
We were...

4267
02:34:31,390 --> 02:34:34,170
We took too long to swap things.

4268
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:36,690
I should have called for the swap.

4269
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:42,930
I should have called for the swap during attack earlier because I was not...

4270
02:34:42,930 --> 02:34:45,470
I could feel that that was not the right comp.

4271
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:46,670
Yeah.

4272
02:34:48,590 --> 02:34:54,590
When the Moon Knight ulted, it was very unfortunate that some people backed up into the Moon Knight ult.

4273
02:34:56,010 --> 02:34:58,130
I definitely should be more vocal.

4274
02:34:59,730 --> 02:35:02,930
We all just made little mistakes here and there.

4275
02:35:04,290 --> 02:35:05,890
I think like...

4276
02:35:06,750 --> 02:35:07,270
Yeah.

4277
02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:11,870
We gotta be more proactive with counters.

4278
02:35:12,610 --> 02:35:17,130
We were brute forcing things that we shouldn't be brute forcing.

4279
02:35:21,090 --> 02:35:22,730
I just hope we win.

4280
02:35:22,890 --> 02:35:25,090
If we win this, I hope we win the tiebreaker.

4281
02:35:26,650 --> 02:35:29,770
Because then if we don't win the tiebreaker, we play longer.

4282
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:31,610
I don't want to play longer.

4283
02:35:32,210 --> 02:35:34,290
I don't want to play longer.

4284
02:35:35,430 --> 02:35:35,970
Yeah.

4285
02:35:41,370 --> 02:35:42,850
This is the...

4286
02:35:58,950 --> 02:35:59,510
Alright.

4287
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:13,410
Are they ready yet?

4288
02:36:13,850 --> 02:36:14,310
Are

4289
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:19,580
they ready?

4290
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:22,720
Oh, they're ready.

4291
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:25,620
They're ready, by the way.

4292
02:36:30,380 --> 02:36:30,740
Alright.

4293
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:31,380
I'm ready, then.

4294
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:32,060
Is everyone here?

4295
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:33,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4296
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:36,040
Naimo, are you here?

4297
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:38,040
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

4298
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:39,720
Alright, let's start this.

4299
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:40,180
Let's get it.

4300
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:41,280
Let's get it.

4301
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:44,000
Let's get the 1-1 and bring it to the tiebreaker.

4302
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:48,020
I'm gonna read up the tiebreaker rules if we do get the 1-1.

4303
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:50,680
Alright.

4304
02:36:55,820 --> 02:36:56,540
I guess...

4305
02:36:56,540 --> 02:36:58,360
I run Adam here, then.

4306
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:01,520
You didn't do bands, Gomez.

4307
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:04,300
You did quick play.

4308
02:37:05,960 --> 02:37:06,760
We don't have bands.

4309
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:09,060
Oh, my god.

4310
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:10,640
I'm actually... Okay, just tell him to leave.

4311
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:12,380
Oh, shit.

4312
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:15,480
Oh, my god.

4313
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:16,540
I messed it up twice.

4314
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:22,680
Leader, friends...

4315
02:37:22,680 --> 02:37:24,940
Invite, invite, invite, invite...

4316
02:37:29,140 --> 02:37:29,500
Alright.

4317
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:30,920
Let's get this quickly.

4318
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:33,240
Boom.

4319
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:35,540
Get this guy on my team.

4320
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:37,040
I'm over here.

4321
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:37,820
Yeah, there we go.

4322
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:38,120
Okay.

4323
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:40,480
You think I can sub in Rye for it?

4324
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:43,940
No, that guy's asleep.

4325
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:45,320
I'll bring in Rye.

4326
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:46,820
Maybe I'll just bring in Hogs.

4327
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:51,680
Let me get him on my PC real quick.

4328
02:38:03,170 --> 02:38:04,190
I'm Luna Snow.

4329
02:38:04,630 --> 02:38:07,270
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

4330
02:38:08,150 --> 02:38:09,830
Yeah, leave the Spider-Man shit open.

4331
02:38:10,610 --> 02:38:12,850
I don't think Spider-Man's even good into triple sport anyway.

4332
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:14,650
Yeah, it's not.

4333
02:38:15,270 --> 02:38:16,730
Five characters are not good against triple.

4334
02:38:18,690 --> 02:38:19,610
Guess what we're running.

4335
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:22,850
Keep band line, but then we band group, so then they can't cheese it.

4336
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:23,830
Yeah, band group first.

4337
02:38:24,470 --> 02:38:25,610
Okay, group first.

4338
02:38:27,930 --> 02:38:28,690
Alright, no, no, no.

4339
02:38:28,750 --> 02:38:29,210
Do rocket.

4340
02:38:29,450 --> 02:38:29,950
Oh, rocket?

4341
02:38:30,150 --> 02:38:30,390
Okay.

4342
02:38:30,390 --> 02:38:30,870
Okay.

4343
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:33,090
Rocket first.

4344
02:38:33,410 --> 02:38:34,630
And then keep Mag safe?

4345
02:38:34,990 --> 02:38:34,990
Yeah.

4346
02:38:35,230 --> 02:38:37,170
Yeah, keep Mag safe.

4347
02:38:37,430 --> 02:38:38,810
As long as we have Mag, we'll be fine.

4348
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:01,610
I don't want to think too much ahead.

4349
02:39:02,430 --> 02:39:03,430
Yeah, just see what they band.

4350
02:39:04,130 --> 02:39:04,690
Okay, thank god.

4351
02:39:05,310 --> 02:39:07,190
I was like, are they gonna protect group?

4352
02:39:08,290 --> 02:39:11,350
If they did, I was gonna say they listened.

4353
02:39:11,810 --> 02:39:16,410
If we did triple tank, triple support, would Wolverine be bad?

4354
02:39:16,650 --> 02:39:18,350
Would Wolverine fuck us over?

4355
02:39:19,490 --> 02:39:21,310
Uh, kinda.

4356
02:39:21,710 --> 02:39:22,050
Kinda.

4357
02:39:22,390 --> 02:39:24,890
We just have to be playing around abilities.

4358
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:35,410
See, this is why this is why I'm thinking, hey, Wolverine wouldn't be that good against the thing.

4359
02:39:36,470 --> 02:39:40,670
Since the thing can frontline the entire time, take a lot of the sponge damage, right?

4360
02:39:41,190 --> 02:39:45,450
Then me and Gabe can kinda go for our little plays on the Strange and Mag.

4361
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:47,810
And then we just rotate ult.

4362
02:39:50,030 --> 02:39:52,750
If I feel like we don't have enough heals, I'm gonna swap to Cloak.

4363
02:39:53,450 --> 02:39:53,850
Yep.

4364
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:56,310
I'll try out with Adam first.

4365
02:39:57,370 --> 02:40:00,170
When people get pulled in, if we do get pulled in, get ready to link.

4366
02:40:00,290 --> 02:40:01,230
Yeah, it's so fun.

4367
02:40:01,710 --> 02:40:03,890
But if you guys get pulled too far, I don't know if I can.

4368
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:06,130
Yep.

4369
02:40:17,550 --> 02:40:19,070
I think we run triple.

4370
02:40:19,810 --> 02:40:26,650
If we're gonna run triple tank in the future, I think we should put Betel in for 3-3.

4371
02:40:27,230 --> 02:40:29,750
Just cause Betel is their mag specialist.

4372
02:40:31,190 --> 02:40:31,750
Alright.

4373
02:40:32,350 --> 02:40:33,110
Seems good.

4374
02:40:35,170 --> 02:40:36,270
Don't do that.

4375
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:42,290
And I think he also has to...

4376
02:40:42,290 --> 02:40:45,370
I think it might be really difficult to mag ult with 200 ping.

4377
02:40:46,790 --> 02:40:50,330
I mean, to be fair, he's doing pretty good for 200 ping though.

4378
02:40:50,390 --> 02:40:53,050
Yeah, he's doing really good with 200 ping.

4379
02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:55,790
But I wanna see if there's...

4380
02:40:56,590 --> 02:40:57,450
Careful Shado.

4381
02:40:57,510 --> 02:40:58,290
He might be TPing.

4382
02:41:01,510 --> 02:41:02,190
Maybe not.

4383
02:41:04,010 --> 02:41:06,190
They might just be... Oh, they might be scouting.

4384
02:41:06,390 --> 02:41:07,070
To see where to TP.

4385
02:41:07,570 --> 02:41:09,530
They could use that to scout.

4386
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:16,980
They have Punisher and Bucky, I think, right?

4387
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:18,260
Yeah, they do.

4388
02:41:19,420 --> 02:41:20,820
Remember not to be too aggressive.

4389
02:41:21,980 --> 02:41:22,580
I'm grabbed.

4390
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:24,220
You're fine.

4391
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:26,480
I got him.

4392
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:28,860
Got my E too quick.

4393
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:33,480
Alright, now play patient again.

4394
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:34,740
I'm back.

4395
02:41:37,020 --> 02:41:42,080
They literally cannot do anything on the Wolverine as long as we just space it and you frontline.

4396
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:43,760
Okay,

4397
02:41:49,910 --> 02:41:51,010
Wolverine's gonna be close again.

4398
02:41:51,410 --> 02:41:52,270
Can you back up a little bit, Bubble?

4399
02:41:52,570 --> 02:41:52,710
Yep.

4400
02:41:54,150 --> 02:41:54,550
Okay.

4401
02:41:56,110 --> 02:41:57,590
I have ult soon.

4402
02:41:58,810 --> 02:41:59,830
We can copy.

4403
02:41:59,970 --> 02:42:00,910
Let me know if you guys are low.

4404
02:42:01,830 --> 02:42:03,090
I'm ulting here.

4405
02:42:03,090 --> 02:42:04,170
I'm still ulting.

4406
02:42:04,430 --> 02:42:05,770
I have my ult too, waiting.

4407
02:42:08,430 --> 02:42:10,150
I got blocked.

4408
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:12,130
Next ult soon.

4409
02:42:13,730 --> 02:42:14,650
Nice cancel.

4410
02:42:15,270 --> 02:42:15,490
Nice cancel.

4411
02:42:16,610 --> 02:42:17,570
I'm grabbed.

4412
02:42:19,070 --> 02:42:19,650
That got all of them.

4413
02:42:19,930 --> 02:42:22,830
I don't have ult here.

4414
02:42:25,390 --> 02:42:26,370
I'm just gonna...

4415
02:42:26,370 --> 02:42:27,150
I don't have rez.

4416
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:29,990
Potion exploded, I think.

4417
02:42:30,710 --> 02:42:33,030
Might be just be better to...

4418
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:34,250
Maybe it is better to just do.

4419
02:42:34,430 --> 02:42:34,630
Maybe.

4420
02:42:35,590 --> 02:42:37,710
Oh, no, but...

4421
02:42:37,710 --> 02:42:39,550
No, I think we should be fine.

4422
02:42:40,990 --> 02:42:41,810
If we need to, I just...

4423
02:42:41,810 --> 02:42:44,270
They used change ult and clobbering ult.

4424
02:42:46,050 --> 02:42:47,990
But we also used clobbering, right?

4425
02:42:48,730 --> 02:42:49,190
Yeah, we did.

4426
02:42:49,410 --> 02:42:50,270
We changed.

4427
02:42:50,530 --> 02:42:51,650
They still have strange eye.

4428
02:42:55,550 --> 02:42:56,610
It's because of the stun.

4429
02:42:56,610 --> 02:42:58,150
Oh, okay, okay.

4430
02:42:58,390 --> 02:42:59,430
We should have it soon then.

4431
02:42:59,970 --> 02:43:01,170
I'll get ready for rez then.

4432
02:43:02,350 --> 02:43:03,390
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

4433
02:43:04,590 --> 02:43:05,570
I have ult here.

4434
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:07,750
I'm gonna play more passive then.

4435
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:10,650
I used my shift.

4436
02:43:10,770 --> 02:43:11,930
I used my shift, so I'm careful.

4437
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:14,930
Everything is afk.

4438
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:20,330
Lucky one.

4439
02:43:21,170 --> 02:43:22,770
I'm gonna get grabbed, but I'm gonna fly out.

4440
02:43:26,610 --> 02:43:26,970
I'm reloading.

4441
02:43:28,250 --> 02:43:28,770
Good.

4442
02:43:30,270 --> 02:43:31,910
Play patient, that's all we do.

4443
02:43:32,350 --> 02:43:33,270
Don't do anything.

4444
02:43:37,830 --> 02:43:39,890
I'm backing out from you guys.

4445
02:43:40,910 --> 02:43:41,410
Just in case.

4446
02:43:41,550 --> 02:43:42,790
I want ult here.

4447
02:43:43,710 --> 02:43:45,030
Give me a second.

4448
02:43:50,450 --> 02:43:53,790
I'm just making it so they can't move.

4449
02:43:55,170 --> 02:43:55,570
Fuck.

4450
02:43:59,550 --> 02:44:00,610
Watch eye, watch eye.

4451
02:44:02,930 --> 02:44:05,230
I got him, I got him.

4452
02:44:08,410 --> 02:44:09,570
Still gonna be looking for eye.

4453
02:44:11,530 --> 02:44:12,670
I almost got his passive out.

4454
02:44:13,690 --> 02:44:14,650
I can't move.

4455
02:44:14,850 --> 02:44:15,750
Fuck me, man.

4456
02:44:15,930 --> 02:44:16,850
I went around the wrong way.

4457
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:17,770
He's looking, he's looking.

4458
02:44:20,450 --> 02:44:21,190
Isolate us.

4459
02:44:21,190 --> 02:44:21,770
Oh, I got grabbed.

4460
02:44:23,390 --> 02:44:24,550
They're gonna stand straight.

4461
02:44:24,650 --> 02:44:26,710
We have no defensive ult here.

4462
02:44:27,150 --> 02:44:27,830
Wolverine passive down.

4463
02:44:28,430 --> 02:44:29,990
They have Wolverine ult too.

4464
02:44:31,010 --> 02:44:32,190
We're giving a lot of space.

4465
02:44:33,230 --> 02:44:34,230
He's looking for eye on top.

4466
02:44:35,210 --> 02:44:35,830
On top, on top.

4467
02:44:37,030 --> 02:44:38,410
We're giving a lot of space, guys.

4468
02:44:39,130 --> 02:44:41,110
Yeah, we are giving too much space.

4469
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:42,290
Nice, nice, nice.

4470
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:43,750
Push back a bit.

4471
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:44,930
Watch the cosmos field.

4472
02:44:45,630 --> 02:44:47,650
I feel like myself again.

4473
02:44:48,910 --> 02:44:49,770
Walk a little bit.

4474
02:44:49,850 --> 02:44:50,810
Push it back down this hallway.

4475
02:44:51,530 --> 02:44:55,320
This time, I'm feeling power.

4476
02:44:55,320 --> 02:44:56,300
Just watch above.

4477
02:44:56,420 --> 02:44:57,180
He might pop down.

4478
02:44:57,720 --> 02:44:59,320
I actually ult around this corner if they come in.

4479
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:00,440
Nice, nice, nice.

4480
02:45:02,320 --> 02:45:03,440
They have thing ult.

4481
02:45:03,500 --> 02:45:04,720
They have thing ult and strange ult.

4482
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:06,460
They have all their ults for this fight.

4483
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:07,660
Except for Bucky.

4484
02:45:09,180 --> 02:45:11,160
The only ult they don't have is Bucky.

4485
02:45:11,400 --> 02:45:12,160
Are they portaling?

4486
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:13,180
What?

4487
02:45:14,380 --> 02:45:15,880
They're portaling, they're portaling.

4488
02:45:16,400 --> 02:45:16,900
Careful, careful.

4489
02:45:17,720 --> 02:45:18,920
We can just rotate.

4490
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:22,140
Over here, over here.

4491
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:22,920
Dropping.

4492
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:27,060
They stocked it.

4493
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:30,640
I can look for ult.

4494
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:32,200
I have ult.

4495
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:36,980
I'm ready for you.

4496
02:45:36,980 --> 02:45:37,220
Okay.

4497
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:41,640
I got you, I got you.

4498
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:43,060
Good ult.

4499
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:46,340
I still have my ult.

4500
02:45:46,660 --> 02:45:50,160
We don't have tank ult.

4501
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:52,880
We just rotate around Shadows.

4502
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:53,880
And Lime moves ult.

4503
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:55,060
Did they use clobber?

4504
02:45:56,820 --> 02:45:58,080
Okay, they have wolverine ult.

4505
02:45:58,320 --> 02:45:59,940
No, they haven't.

4506
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:01,740
They have wolverine ult too.

4507
02:46:02,380 --> 02:46:03,260
Do you go first?

4508
02:46:03,800 --> 02:46:04,660
Yes, I go first.

4509
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:06,740
Actually, you react first.

4510
02:46:07,180 --> 02:46:08,220
Because I have cast time.

4511
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:09,480
You react first.

4512
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:12,160
Watch out, Coney.

4513
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:13,460
They're gonna go for grab.

4514
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:22,620
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

4515
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:30,860
I got ult, I got ult.

4516
02:46:33,260 --> 02:46:33,520
Do you have ult?

4517
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:35,660
I don't have ult.

4518
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:42,000
Yeah, yeah, good ult, good ult.

4519
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:45,300
Okay, where are you, where are you Lime?

4520
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:47,900
I'm next to you, I'm next to you.

4521
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:49,100
I'm ulting next.

4522
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:52,360
Yeah, yeah, I comboed it.

4523
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:53,560
We're good, we're good, we're good.

4524
02:46:54,720 --> 02:46:55,380
I blocked it.

4525
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:56,680
What the...

4526
02:46:58,140 --> 02:46:59,440
I have snaps, I have snaps.

4527
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:00,640
I stole them too.

4528
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:02,380
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

4529
02:47:04,340 --> 02:47:05,200
Okay, okay, it's good.

4530
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:09,300
They don't have TP, we just kill here, we just kill here.

4531
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:15,260
Strange thing, thing, thing, thing, thing!

4532
02:47:15,940 --> 02:47:17,240
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking.

4533
02:47:17,820 --> 02:47:18,540
Strange, strange, strange!

4534
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:20,360
One, one, one, strange, strange, strange!

4535
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:27,540
Nice, nice, good job, good job.

4536
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:29,620
On top, someone get that healer up there.

4537
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:30,720
I see him.

4538
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:32,080
She jumped down.

4539
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:35,800
Let me know if you guys need heals, I can...

4540
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:37,520
I missed a link, I missed a link, just in case.

4541
02:47:39,060 --> 02:47:40,460
I'm just gonna shift for you guys, I'm shifting.

4542
02:47:41,740 --> 02:47:42,940
I'm ulting, I'm ulting, I'm ulting.

4543
02:47:44,420 --> 02:47:45,380
Great, strange, got it.

4544
02:47:45,780 --> 02:47:46,260
We're good, we're good.

4545
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:47,280
Nice.

4546
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:48,680
Good job, good job.

4547
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:50,560
Spider man.

4548
02:47:53,980 --> 02:47:54,800
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

4549
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:56,060
There's a Jeff, kill the Jeff!

4550
02:47:56,280 --> 02:47:57,040
Kill the Jeff!

4551
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:59,060
Got him.

4552
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:00,240
Nice.

4553
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:02,560
Perfect, good job.

4554
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:07,480
Sorry for not holding it, but I was like, without holding it, I got really worried about it.

4555
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:10,760
Good, good.

4556
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:14,340
See, the Wolverine can't really do anything here.

4557
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:20,040
Almost top skins.

4558
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:20,980
This one.

4559
02:48:26,420 --> 02:48:27,460
Good shit, guys.

4560
02:48:27,860 --> 02:48:28,980
Yeah, I got this.

4561
02:48:33,930 --> 02:48:37,110
I'm gonna look at the tiebreaker and see what it says.

4562
02:48:46,470 --> 02:48:48,690
We always portal first, we always portal first, right?

4563
02:48:50,350 --> 02:48:50,990
Yeah, we can.

4564
02:48:51,090 --> 02:48:51,630
We can portal here.

4565
02:48:51,710 --> 02:48:52,210
Okay, okay.

4566
02:48:54,550 --> 02:48:58,550
I mean, if they don't ban strange, then we get Starlord or Luna, which is pretty nice, too.

4567
02:49:00,930 --> 02:49:04,670
That leaves Namor open, probably, but I don't know if we want to do that.

4568
02:49:04,830 --> 02:49:07,590
I mean, we are not gonna play against this team.

4569
02:49:08,670 --> 02:49:09,250
Oh, for the tiebreaker?

4570
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:11,970
Yeah, the tiebreaker is based off...

4571
02:49:12,930 --> 02:49:14,430
I don't know where it is.

4572
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:15,130
Tiebreaker.

4573
02:49:15,970 --> 02:49:17,150
I'm trying to figure out where it is.

4574
02:49:18,470 --> 02:49:22,790
So both of us are gonna have to do tiebreaker, I see.

4575
02:49:24,190 --> 02:49:26,290
Yeah, we both have to do tiebreakers, but against different teams?

4576
02:49:26,310 --> 02:49:27,530
It's based off of performance.

4577
02:49:27,530 --> 02:49:31,050
So I don't know how... I guess we gotta do really well in our last game, then.

4578
02:49:31,650 --> 02:49:32,490
For our performance.

4579
02:49:35,150 --> 02:49:35,890
Oh, actually, no.

4580
02:49:36,230 --> 02:49:36,790
They have a Skrull girl.

4581
02:49:36,910 --> 02:49:38,510
I'm gonna put us all literally on point.

4582
02:49:38,810 --> 02:49:39,530
I'm putting us straight on point.

4583
02:49:40,730 --> 02:49:41,910
I'm pulling DS instantly.

4584
02:49:44,770 --> 02:49:45,390
Their Thing is speeding.

4585
02:49:45,650 --> 02:49:46,790
Thing is shooting.

4586
02:49:47,370 --> 02:49:47,610
I need heal.

4587
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:48,790
I got you guys.

4588
02:49:50,230 --> 02:49:50,930
I'm with you.

4589
02:49:51,410 --> 02:49:51,810
I'm on the mag.

4590
02:49:51,830 --> 02:49:52,250
Mag can die.

4591
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:52,930
Mag can die here, too.

4592
02:49:53,610 --> 02:49:54,190
I'm on Sue.

4593
02:49:54,230 --> 02:49:54,530
Sue one.

4594
02:49:54,610 --> 02:49:54,910
Sue one.

4595
02:49:55,070 --> 02:49:56,250
Yeah, Skrull dead.

4596
02:49:56,330 --> 02:49:56,630
Skrull dead.

4597
02:49:57,830 --> 02:49:59,210
I got one-shot.

4598
02:50:00,150 --> 02:50:00,950
You exploded.

4599
02:50:01,150 --> 02:50:01,710
What the fuck?

4600
02:50:02,330 --> 02:50:03,870
Dude, the mag one-shot me.

4601
02:50:05,350 --> 02:50:05,750
Okay.

4602
02:50:06,250 --> 02:50:06,650
Beautiful.

4603
02:50:08,250 --> 02:50:10,830
So, now we're gonna want to...

4604
02:50:10,830 --> 02:50:13,190
Whenever we save Link, for the Moon Knight ult.

4605
02:50:13,390 --> 02:50:14,090
Okay, okay, okay.

4606
02:50:14,690 --> 02:50:16,050
And we know when they have it.

4607
02:50:16,130 --> 02:50:18,150
I'm gonna play more back, okay?

4608
02:50:18,190 --> 02:50:20,670
Compared to you guys, because I don't wanna be up closer to the Moon Knight.

4609
02:50:20,750 --> 02:50:23,230
The only time I'm gonna put my clone up is for a shift to save somebody.

4610
02:50:23,770 --> 02:50:24,830
So I play far back.

4611
02:50:24,930 --> 02:50:26,070
I'm playing, like, true backline right now.

4612
02:50:26,070 --> 02:50:26,490
I'm pushing up.

4613
02:50:26,570 --> 02:50:27,190
I'm pushing up for Gomez.

4614
02:50:27,310 --> 02:50:28,110
I'm pushing up.

4615
02:50:28,350 --> 02:50:29,150
Okay, I'm in the middle.

4616
02:50:30,090 --> 02:50:30,630
Moon Knight up there.

4617
02:50:31,150 --> 02:50:32,450
Yeah, yeah, watch out.

4618
02:50:34,270 --> 02:50:34,550
Oh,

4619
02:50:38,470 --> 02:50:39,310
shit, I have the useful bomb.

4620
02:50:40,350 --> 02:50:41,730
They don't have ult yet, so it's okay.

4621
02:50:42,090 --> 02:50:42,690
I'm just backing out.

4622
02:50:42,790 --> 02:50:42,890
Careful.

4623
02:50:44,070 --> 02:50:44,510
That was low.

4624
02:50:45,730 --> 02:50:47,950
Careful, they're gonna get...

4625
02:50:47,950 --> 02:50:48,330
They're getting in.

4626
02:50:49,550 --> 02:50:50,910
Oh my god, what the fuck?

4627
02:50:51,530 --> 02:50:52,810
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

4628
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:54,810
Captain America low, Captain America low.

4629
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:55,990
Captain America very low.

4630
02:50:56,550 --> 02:50:59,890
Yeah, we got you, we got you.

4631
02:51:01,490 --> 02:51:02,470
I'm taking your ult.

4632
02:51:02,550 --> 02:51:02,970
I'm going in.

4633
02:51:05,810 --> 02:51:06,370
Focus Sing.

4634
02:51:06,470 --> 02:51:07,050
Sing, Sing, Sing.

4635
02:51:07,050 --> 02:51:07,490
Sing one.

4636
02:51:07,650 --> 02:51:08,030
Sing dead.

4637
02:51:08,350 --> 02:51:08,890
Sing dead.

4638
02:51:09,150 --> 02:51:09,150
Yeah,

4639
02:51:12,850 --> 02:51:13,430
we can get Axe.

4640
02:51:13,510 --> 02:51:14,190
We can still get Axe.

4641
02:51:14,210 --> 02:51:14,650
Yeah, get Axe.

4642
02:51:14,670 --> 02:51:14,990
Get that.

4643
02:51:15,130 --> 02:51:15,850
Push, push, push, push.

4644
02:51:16,330 --> 02:51:16,970
I'm on Galio.

4645
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:17,670
I'm on Galio.

4646
02:51:18,610 --> 02:51:19,830
I'm pushing Cap.

4647
02:51:21,030 --> 02:51:21,610
He's hurt.

4648
02:51:22,530 --> 02:51:23,430
I have my ult.

4649
02:51:23,510 --> 02:51:24,010
I have my ult.

4650
02:51:24,590 --> 02:51:25,350
Swapping to Sue.

4651
02:51:26,310 --> 02:51:26,910
E back.

4652
02:51:29,450 --> 02:51:30,230
Yeah, okay.

4653
02:51:30,410 --> 02:51:31,050
On top, on top.

4654
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:32,710
On the point.

4655
02:51:33,570 --> 02:51:34,510
I got you, I got you, I got you.

4656
02:51:35,230 --> 02:51:36,110
I have charge.

4657
02:51:37,410 --> 02:51:38,050
We're fine.

4658
02:51:41,430 --> 02:51:41,890
Wolf down.

4659
02:51:43,130 --> 02:51:43,830
Nice, nice, nice.

4660
02:51:45,270 --> 02:51:45,910
Cap dead.

4661
02:51:46,890 --> 02:51:47,990
Sing, Sing, Sing.

4662
02:51:47,990 --> 02:51:49,070
Nice, nice, nice.

4663
02:51:49,070 --> 02:51:51,310
Easy win.

4664
02:51:52,090 --> 02:51:52,450
Easy.

4665
02:51:53,850 --> 02:51:55,150
What a dude.

4666
02:51:55,610 --> 02:51:57,190
Such a wipe this time.

4667
02:51:57,750 --> 02:51:59,050
It's because we figured out our comp.

4668
02:52:00,330 --> 02:52:01,050
Against this team.

4669
02:52:01,770 --> 02:52:04,090
I think Groot just fucked us up.

4670
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:04,730
Yeah.

4671
02:52:05,690 --> 02:52:07,910
To beat the tiebreaker...

4672
02:52:07,910 --> 02:52:10,310
Groot just do it so well and everything explodes.

4673
02:52:10,410 --> 02:52:10,790
It's awful.

4674
02:52:11,790 --> 02:52:16,450
So to beat the tiebreaker, we have to stomp the other team hard.

4675
02:52:17,330 --> 02:52:18,830
This is performance based.

4676
02:52:19,070 --> 02:52:19,470
Okay.

4677
02:52:21,850 --> 02:52:22,990
Well, who are we against though?

4678
02:52:23,150 --> 02:52:24,150
We don't know until later, right?

4679
02:52:24,410 --> 02:52:24,670
Yeah.

4680
02:52:25,830 --> 02:52:27,710
Bro, oh my god.

4681
02:52:29,910 --> 02:52:30,090
Damn.

4682
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:32,650
Nothing, I'm just looking at it.

4683
02:52:33,090 --> 02:52:35,010
I keep forgetting Loki can do good damage too.

4684
02:52:35,330 --> 02:52:35,590
Yeah.

4685
02:52:36,270 --> 02:52:37,130
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

4686
02:52:37,150 --> 02:52:41,230
The game before when we both went into overtime, all the healers had like 20k.

4687
02:52:41,750 --> 02:52:43,510
Did the tiebreaker put us into winners?

4688
02:52:43,790 --> 02:52:44,970
Or is that during the losers?

4689
02:52:44,970 --> 02:52:45,410
Huh?

4690
02:52:46,310 --> 02:52:47,230
Like the tiebreaker.

4691
02:52:47,570 --> 02:52:49,190
The tiebreaker would put us into winners.

4692
02:52:49,850 --> 02:52:52,730
So we have to stomp the last team.

4693
02:52:53,230 --> 02:52:55,230
If we stomp the last team...

4694
02:52:55,810 --> 02:52:56,330
Uh...

4695
02:52:56,330 --> 02:52:57,230
We don't do losers.

4696
02:52:57,490 --> 02:52:58,110
We don't do losers.

4697
02:52:58,790 --> 02:52:59,130
Yeah.

4698
02:53:01,010 --> 02:53:03,130
We actually stomped them this time.

4699
02:53:03,330 --> 02:53:06,670
It was even close when they had the minute advantage, which is crazy.

4700
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:07,570
Yeah, yeah.

4701
02:53:08,570 --> 02:53:11,470
It's because we just figured out our comp at the last minute.

4702
02:53:11,470 --> 02:53:12,110
We're actually good.

4703
02:53:12,110 --> 02:53:13,290
We're actually good at the game.

4704
02:53:13,330 --> 02:53:13,990
Hold on a second.

4705
02:53:16,910 --> 02:53:17,430
Yeah.

4706
02:53:17,570 --> 02:53:21,030
I think like attack, we were brute forcing some comps in.

4707
02:53:22,050 --> 02:53:22,570
Yeah.

4708
02:53:22,690 --> 02:53:24,790
So we have to be more proactive on swapping.

4709
02:53:25,150 --> 02:53:25,330
Yeah.

4710
02:53:25,670 --> 02:53:26,390
Scouting, yeah.

4711
02:53:28,290 --> 02:53:29,330
Do we...

4712
02:53:29,330 --> 02:53:30,870
Wait, wait, where did...

4713
02:53:30,870 --> 02:53:33,010
I was like DC for a second.

4714
02:53:33,130 --> 02:53:35,250
I left the comps.

4715
02:53:36,490 --> 02:53:38,130
I'm trying to read.

4716
02:53:40,010 --> 02:53:40,530
Uh...

4717
02:53:40,530 --> 02:53:42,510
Because they said there will be no tie breakers.

4718
02:53:42,610 --> 02:53:46,470
So I guess like, if it's performance based, we just have to do really, really well against the last team.

4719
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:51,120
Because we're still one.

4720
02:53:51,240 --> 02:53:52,380
We're still number one at the moment.

4721
02:53:53,620 --> 02:53:54,620
Am I dipping out?

4722
02:53:55,360 --> 02:53:56,200
That's the plan.

4723
02:53:56,380 --> 02:53:57,720
We'll see who we're playing against.

4724
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:01,360
Because we're playing against a hard team.

4725
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:02,800
Or we're playing against them again.

4726
02:54:03,880 --> 02:54:07,680
I think we need to run you as our 3-3.

4727
02:54:08,260 --> 02:54:10,040
I just realized Kony got the MVP last game.

4728
02:54:10,040 --> 02:54:10,560
Yeah.

4729
02:54:12,140 --> 02:54:13,100
Kony, okay.

4730
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:16,520
Kony might be the thing.

4731
02:54:16,900 --> 02:54:19,040
Let me screenshot this real fast.

4732
02:54:25,690 --> 02:54:26,950
Sorry, I was in the bathroom.

4733
02:54:27,110 --> 02:54:27,810
Yeah, I got MVP.

4734
02:54:28,030 --> 02:54:28,790
Just so everybody knows.

4735
02:54:30,390 --> 02:54:31,570
Just to make that clear.

4736
02:54:34,050 --> 02:54:35,830
So we gotta like...

4737
02:54:36,410 --> 02:54:38,350
I don't know if we play against them again.

4738
02:54:38,450 --> 02:54:40,230
Because of the fact that...

4739
02:54:40,230 --> 02:54:41,590
They're doing switch bracket.

4740
02:54:42,230 --> 02:54:42,590
Yeah.

4741
02:54:42,630 --> 02:54:45,250
It depends on if any other team went...

4742
02:54:45,250 --> 02:54:45,930
What?

4743
02:54:46,730 --> 02:54:47,430
5-1?

4744
02:54:47,930 --> 02:54:48,850
Because we went 5-1.

4745
02:54:48,890 --> 02:54:49,650
They went 5-1.

4746
02:54:49,730 --> 02:54:51,710
If there are two more 5-1 teams, then maybe.

4747
02:54:52,070 --> 02:54:53,650
But if not, we play them again.

4748
02:54:53,710 --> 02:54:54,110
I would imagine.

4749
02:54:55,570 --> 02:54:55,930
Yeah.

4750
02:54:56,130 --> 02:54:57,010
But here's the thing.

4751
02:54:58,410 --> 02:54:58,770
Like...

4752
02:54:58,770 --> 02:55:00,550
Dude, I'm fucked up.

4753
02:55:02,190 --> 02:55:03,590
I really think that...

4754
02:55:04,530 --> 02:55:05,790
If they're threatened by this comp.

4755
02:55:05,810 --> 02:55:07,230
Because this is a really good comp against them.

4756
02:55:07,270 --> 02:55:08,410
They don't know what to do because they're cheesing.

4757
02:55:08,410 --> 02:55:08,670
Yeah, yeah.

4758
02:55:08,810 --> 02:55:09,050
Definitely.

4759
02:55:09,370 --> 02:55:11,230
So they're gonna leave something open for us.

4760
02:55:11,270 --> 02:55:13,990
If they wanna focus ban one of our good tanks.

4761
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:16,290
We get Starlord or we get Luna.

4762
02:55:17,170 --> 02:55:18,990
Yeah, we get Luna or Starlord.

4763
02:55:19,090 --> 02:55:20,690
That's also really good for us too.

4764
02:55:21,150 --> 02:55:21,470
Yeah.

4765
02:55:21,850 --> 02:55:23,510
We're just gonna keep banning Rocket and Groot.

4766
02:55:23,750 --> 02:55:25,650
Because that's the main part of their cheese.

4767
02:55:25,830 --> 02:55:28,250
The overload ammo and the walls and all that shit.

4768
02:55:29,090 --> 02:55:29,330
Yup.

4769
02:55:30,510 --> 02:55:30,790
Okay.

4770
02:55:32,190 --> 02:55:34,890
Adam was definitely a really good pick there.

4771
02:55:35,090 --> 02:55:35,510
For sure.

4772
02:55:35,510 --> 02:55:36,950
Yeah, the Soulbond helped a lot.

4773
02:55:37,150 --> 02:55:38,870
Gave me enough time to shift.

4774
02:55:39,270 --> 02:55:40,510
To save some people as well.

4775
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:47,080
See how OP the Korean comps are.

4776
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:48,820
That shit was crazy.

4777
02:55:49,620 --> 02:55:50,260
Three tank.

4778
02:55:53,940 --> 02:55:55,120
We've made a loop.

4779
02:55:55,580 --> 02:55:55,620
Back.

4780
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:57,420
Back here again.

4781
02:55:59,560 --> 02:56:01,720
I'm not exactly thrilled about that.

4782
02:56:01,720 --> 02:56:02,260
Aww.

4783
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:06,420
Which team are we waiting on?

4784
02:56:07,600 --> 02:56:09,200
We're waiting on one more team.

4785
02:56:09,460 --> 02:56:10,220
And then it should be good.

4786
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:10,920
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

4787
02:56:11,060 --> 02:56:11,480
I'll be right back.

4788
02:56:13,660 --> 02:56:14,860
When's the next game?

4789
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:17,380
Do we know?

4790
02:56:20,620 --> 02:56:20,980
Hello?

4791
02:56:22,620 --> 02:56:22,980
Hello?

4792
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:24,320
In like three minutes.

4793
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:25,340
Okay.

4794
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:29,900
I think it's just waiting for the other group to finish, right?

4795
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,100
Or the other teams to finish.

4796
02:56:31,100 --> 02:56:31,780
Yep.

4797
02:56:48,480 --> 02:56:49,080
Alright.

4798
02:56:50,020 --> 02:56:51,420
Hello chat, hello.

4799
02:56:52,300 --> 02:56:53,280
Oh shit, I'm not muted.

4800
02:56:54,660 --> 02:56:55,000
Hi.

4801
02:56:55,740 --> 02:56:56,460
Hello chat.

4802
02:56:58,220 --> 02:56:58,600
Oh my god.

4803
02:57:05,310 --> 02:57:06,750
Oh, I'm back chat.

4804
02:57:06,870 --> 02:57:07,530
I muted myself.

4805
02:57:08,030 --> 02:57:09,090
I was happy.

4806
02:57:09,510 --> 02:57:11,370
My item was really good.

4807
02:57:11,630 --> 02:57:12,370
During that game.

4808
02:57:12,470 --> 02:57:13,410
I was really worried.

4809
02:57:13,410 --> 02:57:15,450
Because like...

4810
02:57:15,450 --> 02:57:17,430
I don't know.

4811
02:57:17,530 --> 02:57:18,330
I was just really worried.

4812
02:57:21,830 --> 02:57:22,310
Yeah.

4813
02:57:22,570 --> 02:57:23,730
My item was bad.

4814
02:57:23,870 --> 02:57:27,290
I was making really good decisions on item.

4815
02:57:27,950 --> 02:57:28,230
And stuff.

4816
02:57:28,410 --> 02:57:30,090
I don't play item that much.

4817
02:57:30,550 --> 02:57:33,290
So I was just like, oh thank god.

4818
02:57:33,410 --> 02:57:35,410
I was like...

4819
02:57:36,930 --> 02:57:37,410
Yeah.

4820
02:57:39,090 --> 02:57:39,710
Because on item.

4821
02:57:39,930 --> 02:57:41,590
It's more of a mind game.

4822
02:57:41,590 --> 02:57:42,210
On item.

4823
02:57:42,750 --> 02:57:44,730
I have to be aware of my...

4824
02:57:45,430 --> 02:57:46,970
Of my cooldowns.

4825
02:57:47,410 --> 02:57:49,030
I have to be aware of my cooldowns.

4826
02:57:49,070 --> 02:57:49,670
And my abilities.

4827
02:57:50,170 --> 02:57:52,730
So I have to make decisions on whether or not to use soul link.

4828
02:57:52,890 --> 02:57:53,150
And everything.

4829
02:57:54,570 --> 02:57:56,690
And also my snaps too.

4830
02:57:56,710 --> 02:57:58,310
Because I can't build ult that fast.

4831
02:57:58,370 --> 02:57:58,910
With healing.

4832
02:57:59,570 --> 02:58:01,530
Because I don't want to waste my snaps.

4833
02:58:01,730 --> 02:58:04,010
On situations where my other two healers can heal.

4834
02:58:06,250 --> 02:58:07,050
So like...

4835
02:58:07,050 --> 02:58:08,190
And I have to know when to ult.

4836
02:58:08,190 --> 02:58:11,230
So the moment when Gomez got picked.

4837
02:58:11,350 --> 02:58:12,230
I instantly went for the ult.

4838
02:58:12,390 --> 02:58:13,570
Because I was like...

4839
02:58:13,570 --> 02:58:15,950
Our comp needed all of us to be alive.

4840
02:58:16,990 --> 02:58:17,350
So...

4841
02:58:18,030 --> 02:58:19,410
The moment we got picked.

4842
02:58:19,510 --> 02:58:20,230
I just had to ult.

4843
02:58:20,470 --> 02:58:22,250
And just try to find a place.

4844
02:58:22,810 --> 02:58:24,470
And I was happy I was hitting shots too on Adam.

4845
02:58:24,550 --> 02:58:26,410
Because his projectiles are pretty difficult.

4846
02:58:28,650 --> 02:58:30,250
His projectiles are like...

4847
02:58:30,250 --> 02:58:32,450
I haven't done his projectiles in a long time.

4848
02:58:32,490 --> 02:58:33,690
Because I don't play...

4849
02:58:34,390 --> 02:58:35,710
Adam is such a...

4850
02:58:35,710 --> 02:58:37,510
Character that...

4851
02:58:37,510 --> 02:58:39,290
It's harder to play in high elo.

4852
02:58:39,550 --> 02:58:41,570
And usually a better support player would play...

4853
02:58:41,570 --> 02:58:42,930
Adam in one above all.

4854
02:58:43,410 --> 02:58:45,930
So I would just be placed on...

4855
02:58:45,930 --> 02:58:47,670
I would either be on Luna duty.

4856
02:58:47,850 --> 02:58:48,850
Or Sue duty.

4857
02:58:49,290 --> 02:58:51,470
And then the better player would be on Adam.

4858
02:58:52,110 --> 02:58:52,590
So...

4859
02:58:54,050 --> 02:58:54,530
Yeah.

4860
02:58:55,510 --> 02:58:57,190
So it was like...

4861
02:58:57,810 --> 02:58:59,790
I didn't get a chance to practice Adam a lot.

4862
02:59:00,030 --> 02:59:02,190
Yeah, my voice is fucked right now.

4863
02:59:02,230 --> 02:59:03,230
Because I talked a lot.

4864
02:59:06,500 --> 02:59:06,980
Yeah.

4865
02:59:07,240 --> 02:59:09,400
I'm just glad I made good calls for a so long too.

4866
02:59:10,580 --> 02:59:11,060
Because...

4867
02:59:11,060 --> 02:59:12,820
That one was the riskiest shit.

4868
02:59:13,020 --> 02:59:14,700
Where the fuck did I put my Kleenex?

4869
02:59:15,940 --> 02:59:16,420
Kleenex.

4870
02:59:16,660 --> 02:59:17,880
I'm gonna blow my nose.

4871
02:59:18,580 --> 02:59:19,980
I opened one...

4872
02:59:19,980 --> 02:59:20,340
Today.

4873
02:59:22,240 --> 02:59:24,380
I know I opened one today.

4874
02:59:25,480 --> 02:59:26,240
Where did it go?

4875
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:28,860
Did I put it away?

4876
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:31,380
I'm gonna blow my nose.

4877
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:32,800
I'm gonna open a new one.

4878
02:59:32,800 --> 02:59:33,400
I'll be back.

4879
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:36,900
I'm gonna open a new pack of tissues.

4880
02:59:57,240 --> 02:59:59,560
I'm gonna feed Doki Amber Doge real quick, guys.

4881
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:00,280
Give me a sec.

4882
03:00:27,390 --> 03:00:28,130
Yeah, I'm back.

4883
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:29,690
I'm back.

4884
03:00:30,370 --> 03:00:31,990
Feed him real quick.

4885
03:00:32,790 --> 03:00:33,550
I do hope...

4886
03:00:33,550 --> 03:00:35,870
If we win Winners Bracket...

4887
03:00:37,390 --> 03:00:37,990
Then...

4888
03:00:37,990 --> 03:00:40,590
I can walk him in time.

4889
03:00:41,970 --> 03:00:43,070
That's really it.

4890
03:00:46,150 --> 03:00:46,990
But yeah.

4891
03:00:47,550 --> 03:00:48,690
Oh my gosh.

4892
03:00:49,070 --> 03:00:51,150
I'm just happy we won that fight.

4893
03:00:52,910 --> 03:00:55,850
See, Mortal Rivals is all about figuring out the team comps too.

4894
03:00:56,330 --> 03:00:59,750
It doesn't matter how good your team is individual wise.

4895
03:01:02,370 --> 03:01:04,610
Comps still counter you and stuff like that.

4896
03:01:05,610 --> 03:01:09,030
Definitely our weakest point right now is...

4897
03:01:09,030 --> 03:01:11,530
We're not proactive when we're swapping comps.

4898
03:01:11,530 --> 03:01:13,570
Which I told Gomez.

4899
03:01:13,750 --> 03:01:15,790
If you think this comp isn't working...

4900
03:01:15,790 --> 03:01:16,810
Just call for the swap.

4901
03:01:17,590 --> 03:01:18,830
Don't force it.

4902
03:01:21,310 --> 03:01:23,510
Yeah, because they were hard countering us at first.

4903
03:01:23,930 --> 03:01:25,590
But the moment we figured out the comp...

4904
03:01:26,050 --> 03:01:28,270
Because when we figured out the comp...

4905
03:01:28,270 --> 03:01:29,590
They didn't know what the fuck to do.

4906
03:01:31,350 --> 03:01:32,250
Because of it.

4907
03:01:32,510 --> 03:01:36,790
They didn't know what to do when we figured out how to counter them.

4908
03:01:43,500 --> 03:01:43,980
Um...

4909
03:01:43,980 --> 03:01:47,100
They already put the next team that we're playing against.

4910
03:01:49,340 --> 03:01:50,700
I'll give you the code.

4911
03:01:51,140 --> 03:01:53,140
The thing is, do we run Betel first or Jay first?

4912
03:01:56,660 --> 03:01:58,240
We'll do a reversal now.

4913
03:01:58,320 --> 03:02:00,320
We'll put Betel in and then we'll put...

4914
03:02:00,320 --> 03:02:00,900
Jay later?

4915
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:01,240
Okay.

4916
03:02:02,040 --> 03:02:03,200
I'll give you the ID.

4917
03:02:09,780 --> 03:02:10,740
I'll tell...

4918
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:12,100
We're running...

4919
03:02:12,100 --> 03:02:14,420
We are running Betel first.

4920
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:19,180
I'll give you the UID too.

4921
03:02:21,740 --> 03:02:24,220
Let me scout this team out real fast.

4922
03:02:26,720 --> 03:02:28,580
So this is our tiebreaker team?

4923
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:30,900
Yeah, we have to stomp them basically.

4924
03:02:34,240 --> 03:02:36,360
They have a Lord Bucky.

4925
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:37,480
A Lord Bucky.

4926
03:02:38,300 --> 03:02:39,020
Um... Namor.

4927
03:02:40,260 --> 03:02:40,780
Strange.

4928
03:02:40,940 --> 03:02:41,920
They're running Strange.

4929
03:02:42,580 --> 03:02:43,480
Uh... Mag.

4930
03:02:44,380 --> 03:02:46,240
They're running different comps every time.

4931
03:02:47,040 --> 03:02:49,020
But they do have a Storm player too.

4932
03:02:50,180 --> 03:02:51,940
Do we just want to ban Bucky?

4933
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:53,600
Yeah, I mean...

4934
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:54,860
Their Bucky is...

4935
03:02:54,860 --> 03:02:55,960
Yeah, their Bucky is their best player.

4936
03:02:56,640 --> 03:02:58,400
Wait, let me double check.

4937
03:03:00,220 --> 03:03:00,740
Uh...

4938
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:03,540
Yeah, their Bucky plays hella Bucky.

4939
03:03:04,160 --> 03:03:04,720
Actually, no.

4940
03:03:04,780 --> 03:03:05,960
Their Namor is their best player.

4941
03:03:07,480 --> 03:03:09,640
Their Namor has more kills, but...

4942
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:10,860
Their Bucky has more damage.

4943
03:03:13,140 --> 03:03:13,740
They banned Jeff?

4944
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:15,260
Wait, what?

4945
03:03:16,480 --> 03:03:19,120
Oh wait, they did.

4946
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:21,040
I guess they played against a Jeff player.

4947
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:26,580
I mean, one of them seems like a Namor...

4948
03:03:28,120 --> 03:03:28,840
Specialist too.

4949
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:29,620
So I don't know.

4950
03:03:30,320 --> 03:03:32,140
They run a bunch of comps, but it's only Bucky.

4951
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:35,560
So we just ban Bucky then?

4952
03:03:37,080 --> 03:03:41,520
I don't see no Groot, so I don't think they played Groot.

4953
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:46,480
Has any team like pulled out ahead with all like twos?

4954
03:03:47,240 --> 03:03:47,720
No.

4955
03:03:48,420 --> 03:03:51,160
There's a four-team tie for first.

4956
03:03:51,480 --> 03:03:51,720
Yeah.

4957
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:55,300
If we stomp them and get two-two, then we win the tiebreaker.

4958
03:03:55,700 --> 03:03:58,440
We just need to stomp them and win two.

4959
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:01,940
It has to be a big stomp to win the tiebreaker.

4960
03:04:03,480 --> 03:04:05,380
Alright, what's the tiebreaker map?

4961
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:08,440
There's no tiebreaker map, but like...

4962
03:04:08,440 --> 03:04:09,920
We have to stomp this team.

4963
03:04:10,180 --> 03:04:11,480
Because it's performance-based.

4964
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:13,140
So which one is this?

4965
03:04:13,540 --> 03:04:15,860
This one is...

4966
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:19,520
Shibuya...

4967
03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:21,120
Shibuya Convergence.

4968
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:24,080
Wait, is this round four or five?

4969
03:04:24,160 --> 03:04:25,380
This is round...

4970
03:04:25,920 --> 03:04:26,400
Round four.

4971
03:04:26,560 --> 03:04:27,320
Oh wait, it's round four.

4972
03:04:28,140 --> 03:04:28,520
Oh, okay.

4973
03:04:28,900 --> 03:04:30,200
It's Hall of...

4974
03:04:30,200 --> 03:04:33,240
I guess we have to stomp two teams then.

4975
03:04:33,240 --> 03:04:34,840
Nevermind, we have two more rounds.

4976
03:04:36,480 --> 03:04:37,420
I didn't see the...

4977
03:04:37,420 --> 03:04:39,400
I did not see the round five at the end.

4978
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:41,800
Cause I had to move it.

4979
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:43,240
Um, Hall of...

4980
03:04:43,900 --> 03:04:45,040
Uh, Hall of T'Challa.

4981
03:04:45,420 --> 03:04:46,460
I don't know how to pronounce it.

4982
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:47,920
It's Convergence.

4983
03:04:48,320 --> 03:04:48,940
T'Challa!

4984
03:04:50,120 --> 03:04:51,080
From Wakanda!

4985
03:04:51,540 --> 03:04:53,560
So their last fight was...

4986
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:57,460
They ran Strange Mag, Bucky, Namor, Cloak and Dagger, and Luna.

4987
03:04:57,900 --> 03:05:00,820
So we just ban Bucky first and see what they do after.

4988
03:05:01,320 --> 03:05:02,320
And then we protect Mag.

4989
03:05:04,600 --> 03:05:05,180
Alright.

4990
03:05:11,230 --> 03:05:11,810
Alright.

4991
03:05:11,810 --> 03:05:12,990
Best player is the Namor.

4992
03:05:13,570 --> 03:05:14,890
Alright, are we all ready?

4993
03:05:15,250 --> 03:05:16,330
Yeah, we're ready.

4994
03:05:17,050 --> 03:05:17,630
Alright.

4995
03:05:18,630 --> 03:05:19,210
Alright.

4996
03:05:20,250 --> 03:05:21,310
We're going in.

4997
03:05:22,330 --> 03:05:23,050
Starting right away.

4998
03:05:23,570 --> 03:05:24,870
Are we running 2-2-2 first?

4999
03:05:25,970 --> 03:05:27,790
Or just go off the bad line?

5000
03:05:29,190 --> 03:05:29,530
Good.

5001
03:05:30,650 --> 03:05:31,950
We can do 2-2-2 first.

5002
03:05:36,670 --> 03:05:38,150
I shine in darkness.

5003
03:05:41,150 --> 03:05:42,030
Okay, Coney.

5004
03:05:44,400 --> 03:05:45,430
Coney on the Spider-Man.

5005
03:05:45,590 --> 03:05:46,690
I got something special!

5006
03:05:47,990 --> 03:05:50,090
Oh, I believe.

5007
03:05:51,710 --> 03:05:52,690
Ah, wow!

5008
03:05:52,990 --> 03:05:53,990
I saw that one coming.

5009
03:05:54,070 --> 03:05:54,410
Wow!

5010
03:05:55,670 --> 03:05:56,650
I can't believe it.

5011
03:05:57,490 --> 03:05:58,450
Uh, Bucky.

5012
03:06:00,510 --> 03:06:01,670
Ban Buck.

5013
03:06:02,430 --> 03:06:03,810
And then protect Mag.

5014
03:06:07,770 --> 03:06:09,350
Wait, what if we protect Luna?

5015
03:06:09,610 --> 03:06:11,330
Or no, they want the team up.

5016
03:06:11,570 --> 03:06:12,610
Yeah, they want the team up.

5017
03:06:12,710 --> 03:06:14,750
Yeah, it's in our benefit to get Mag.

5018
03:06:14,850 --> 03:06:16,370
Yeah, because they have a Namor player.

5019
03:06:17,650 --> 03:06:20,490
I mean, we can fuck them over and just ban Luna and I'll just play...

5020
03:06:21,590 --> 03:06:22,570
I'll play something else.

5021
03:06:22,670 --> 03:06:22,930
I'll see you.

5022
03:06:24,190 --> 03:06:26,910
And we really want to fuck up their Namor.

5023
03:06:26,990 --> 03:06:29,330
But the Namor also plays Storm and Hela.

5024
03:06:29,630 --> 03:06:30,190
That's the thing.

5025
03:06:30,350 --> 03:06:30,690
Oh, it's fine.

5026
03:06:33,270 --> 03:06:36,650
Wait, no one fucked up both of those guys.

5027
03:06:40,170 --> 03:06:43,010
What fucks up both their comps?

5028
03:06:43,310 --> 03:06:46,410
Uh, the other character that would fuck up their comp would be...

5029
03:06:46,410 --> 03:06:46,890
Oh, they did.

5030
03:06:47,130 --> 03:06:47,670
They banned their own Luna.

5031
03:06:47,870 --> 03:06:49,130
They banned Luna.

5032
03:06:49,510 --> 03:06:50,230
We could ban Storm.

5033
03:06:51,090 --> 03:06:53,610
Do you think they'll choose and try to go Groot?

5034
03:06:55,370 --> 03:06:56,170
Um, no.

5035
03:06:56,630 --> 03:06:57,410
Have they played Groot?

5036
03:06:57,590 --> 03:06:57,850
No.

5037
03:06:59,590 --> 03:07:00,710
Should we just ban Storm?

5038
03:07:00,710 --> 03:07:01,810
I'm just gonna ban Storm.

5039
03:07:01,810 --> 03:07:02,830
I'm just gonna ban Storm.

5040
03:07:03,950 --> 03:07:04,770
We didn't struggle.

5041
03:07:04,930 --> 03:07:06,270
We never struggle against Roverian, really.

5042
03:07:06,610 --> 03:07:06,950
I think so.

5043
03:07:07,110 --> 03:07:07,370
We're fine.

5044
03:07:07,510 --> 03:07:09,090
I think just ban Storm and get that out.

5045
03:07:10,730 --> 03:07:10,950
Alright.

5046
03:07:14,690 --> 03:07:15,490
We'll do...

5047
03:07:15,490 --> 03:07:18,130
So, we're kind of forced on the...

5048
03:07:18,130 --> 03:07:19,310
I mean, we can just do this again.

5049
03:07:19,450 --> 03:07:20,050
We could.

5050
03:07:20,390 --> 03:07:21,810
We could just pull this out.

5051
03:07:21,870 --> 03:07:23,590
We kind of dominated on it, to be honest.

5052
03:07:24,090 --> 03:07:24,630
Fuck it.

5053
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:25,430
Let's do it again.

5054
03:07:25,870 --> 03:07:29,310
What was that team that fucked our 3-3's over?

5055
03:07:29,310 --> 03:07:30,930
What did they play that fucked it over?

5056
03:07:31,450 --> 03:07:33,770
They ran both...

5057
03:07:33,770 --> 03:07:34,470
No, not Storm.

5058
03:07:34,610 --> 03:07:36,630
They ran Squirrel and Moon Knight.

5059
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:38,070
Squirrel, Moon Knight, right.

5060
03:07:38,270 --> 03:07:40,930
Okay, so the moment they swap to Squirrel and Moon Knight, we just swap comms.

5061
03:07:41,410 --> 03:07:41,730
Okay.

5062
03:07:42,430 --> 03:07:44,470
That's if they do it, though.

5063
03:07:44,530 --> 03:07:45,630
I don't want to give that away.

5064
03:07:45,910 --> 03:07:47,150
Like, they might not even know.

5065
03:07:47,610 --> 03:07:48,210
We saw it on stream.

5066
03:07:48,310 --> 03:07:48,630
How lucky.

5067
03:07:49,130 --> 03:07:49,670
They're gonna do it now.

5068
03:07:50,390 --> 03:07:51,610
I mean, they've been...

5069
03:07:53,150 --> 03:07:54,990
They can just watch the VOD later.

5070
03:07:55,070 --> 03:07:58,970
So, if it's like, they have both Moon Knight and Squirrel or just both of them, or just one.

5071
03:08:00,110 --> 03:08:01,510
I think it's both of them.

5072
03:08:01,770 --> 03:08:02,890
Both of them fucked us over.

5073
03:08:03,410 --> 03:08:04,930
I don't think they have a Squirrel girl, though.

5074
03:08:04,970 --> 03:08:07,550
If they run Moon Knight, Groot, we swap off 3-3.

5075
03:08:07,570 --> 03:08:09,750
Okay, by the way, we're gonna do something because I do this in scrims.

5076
03:08:09,850 --> 03:08:10,690
Okay, so come here.

5077
03:08:11,110 --> 03:08:11,770
They're gonna portal.

5078
03:08:12,770 --> 03:08:14,330
No, I know exactly what you're talking about.

5079
03:08:14,370 --> 03:08:14,890
I've done it before.

5080
03:08:15,130 --> 03:08:15,790
I know exactly what you're talking about.

5081
03:08:15,790 --> 03:08:16,430
No, no, not there.

5082
03:08:16,830 --> 03:08:17,070
By me.

5083
03:08:17,150 --> 03:08:17,610
By my portal.

5084
03:08:18,290 --> 03:08:19,070
By the portal.

5085
03:08:20,450 --> 03:08:23,690
We're just gonna shoot Strange.

5086
03:08:24,330 --> 03:08:25,870
Strange will get blasted if they try to TP.

5087
03:08:26,350 --> 03:08:27,070
Okay, are they TPing?

5088
03:08:28,650 --> 03:08:29,390
If they don't.

5089
03:08:29,950 --> 03:08:29,970
Let's see.

5090
03:08:31,130 --> 03:08:31,990
They're walking up.

5091
03:08:32,170 --> 03:08:32,670
I'm just looking.

5092
03:08:33,850 --> 03:08:35,250
Maybe they do a walk-up TP?

5093
03:08:35,610 --> 03:08:36,690
They're still walking through main.

5094
03:08:38,130 --> 03:08:39,190
They're walking through main.

5095
03:08:39,770 --> 03:08:40,990
I'm gonna put TP right now.

5096
03:08:42,690 --> 03:08:43,590
They're going through high.

5097
03:08:43,770 --> 03:08:44,190
They're going through high.

5098
03:08:44,270 --> 03:08:44,550
Shoot them.

5099
03:08:45,310 --> 03:08:47,230
You can break the wall.

5100
03:08:47,370 --> 03:08:48,410
You can break that huge wall right there.

5101
03:08:49,190 --> 03:08:51,330
They're looking at... They're heading up.

5102
03:08:51,330 --> 03:08:51,850
They're heading up now.

5103
03:08:51,930 --> 03:08:54,130
They're running Moon Knight.

5104
03:08:54,430 --> 03:08:55,410
Run over.

5105
03:08:56,610 --> 03:08:57,570
Fly on me.

5106
03:08:59,550 --> 03:09:01,290
Me and you stay up here.

5107
03:09:04,510 --> 03:09:06,610
Try not to take too much damage.

5108
03:09:07,970 --> 03:09:08,430
Moon Knight one.

5109
03:09:12,130 --> 03:09:13,010
Strange low.

5110
03:09:13,930 --> 03:09:14,990
Don't peek too much.

5111
03:09:16,030 --> 03:09:17,190
Jesus, that did a lot.

5112
03:09:17,410 --> 03:09:18,330
Don't peek too much.

5113
03:09:18,330 --> 03:09:20,150
We have to play together like last time.

5114
03:09:21,070 --> 03:09:22,210
I have to link us.

5115
03:09:22,310 --> 03:09:22,950
I'm linking us.

5116
03:09:23,010 --> 03:09:23,610
Strange low.

5117
03:09:25,850 --> 03:09:26,650
We're up two.

5118
03:09:27,670 --> 03:09:30,270
We're up one actually.

5119
03:09:31,350 --> 03:09:32,130
We're good.

5120
03:09:32,510 --> 03:09:32,690
We're killing.

5121
03:09:34,550 --> 03:09:35,430
Let's walk up.

5122
03:09:35,830 --> 03:09:36,470
Good job.

5123
03:09:36,890 --> 03:09:38,270
Walk up the mag.

5124
03:09:39,490 --> 03:09:39,990
Nice!

5125
03:09:42,350 --> 03:09:42,710
I'm bad.

5126
03:09:42,790 --> 03:09:43,830
I got blown the fuck up.

5127
03:09:43,830 --> 03:09:44,430
Oh my god.

5128
03:09:45,550 --> 03:09:46,050
Jesus.

5129
03:09:50,930 --> 03:09:51,930
Right there.

5130
03:09:53,330 --> 03:09:53,670
Behind us.

5131
03:09:59,750 --> 03:10:01,630
If you do it, let me jump you.

5132
03:10:01,870 --> 03:10:02,210
I got you.

5133
03:10:02,330 --> 03:10:03,330
I'm low.

5134
03:10:03,790 --> 03:10:05,070
I got you.

5135
03:10:06,850 --> 03:10:07,850
It's big.

5136
03:10:09,530 --> 03:10:11,150
Strange on me.

5137
03:10:11,150 --> 03:10:12,170
That's fine.

5138
03:10:12,570 --> 03:10:13,050
Strange.

5139
03:10:14,730 --> 03:10:16,250
I got him.

5140
03:10:16,810 --> 03:10:17,550
Get the mag.

5141
03:10:17,970 --> 03:10:19,370
Good job.

5142
03:10:22,350 --> 03:10:25,910
They might have their support ults.

5143
03:10:25,930 --> 03:10:26,650
They're going to have support ults.

5144
03:10:26,770 --> 03:10:28,350
I'll try and slow on us.

5145
03:10:28,810 --> 03:10:30,510
I have ult for cloak and dagger.

5146
03:10:31,690 --> 03:10:32,630
Skeleton figure left.

5147
03:10:32,810 --> 03:10:33,310
Skeleton figure left.

5148
03:10:34,190 --> 03:10:34,710
I'm looking.

5149
03:10:36,530 --> 03:10:37,250
I'm invisible.

5150
03:10:37,250 --> 03:10:38,750
You should scout line.

5151
03:10:38,930 --> 03:10:39,870
I'm just sitting.

5152
03:10:44,270 --> 03:10:44,930
They're coming.

5153
03:10:45,090 --> 03:10:45,490
Hella here.

5154
03:10:46,730 --> 03:10:47,350
Go back to me.

5155
03:10:48,330 --> 03:10:48,930
They're wolf.

5156
03:10:52,030 --> 03:10:52,790
Hella's on the left.

5157
03:10:53,770 --> 03:10:55,270
I'm going left side.

5158
03:10:55,350 --> 03:10:55,930
I'll mark her.

5159
03:10:56,550 --> 03:10:57,150
Wolf here.

5160
03:10:57,250 --> 03:10:57,910
He's trying to come in.

5161
03:10:58,350 --> 03:10:58,790
He stopped.

5162
03:11:00,850 --> 03:11:01,410
Right there.

5163
03:11:02,930 --> 03:11:03,750
Wolverine very low.

5164
03:11:03,750 --> 03:11:04,390
He couldn't do anything.

5165
03:11:05,690 --> 03:11:07,170
I'm keeping my soul bond.

5166
03:11:08,630 --> 03:11:09,570
I have ult up.

5167
03:11:10,170 --> 03:11:11,270
Just hold the front line.

5168
03:11:12,390 --> 03:11:14,870
And then I just go and hold the off angle.

5169
03:11:17,710 --> 03:11:18,670
I'll ult first.

5170
03:11:19,150 --> 03:11:19,450
Right here.

5171
03:11:21,530 --> 03:11:21,910
Nice.

5172
03:11:22,790 --> 03:11:25,170
I have ult though.

5173
03:11:26,190 --> 03:11:26,810
I'm ulting back.

5174
03:11:27,870 --> 03:11:29,030
Is it worth rezzing?

5175
03:11:29,130 --> 03:11:29,510
No, it's not.

5176
03:11:29,550 --> 03:11:30,170
I'm not going to use it.

5177
03:11:30,170 --> 03:11:31,310
I'm not going to use it.

5178
03:11:31,510 --> 03:11:32,850
No, I'm fine.

5179
03:11:33,510 --> 03:11:34,190
Got it.

5180
03:11:35,070 --> 03:11:35,610
Nice.

5181
03:11:36,170 --> 03:11:36,750
Good ult.

5182
03:11:37,590 --> 03:11:38,410
Good shit.

5183
03:11:41,890 --> 03:11:43,450
They switched to Punisher.

5184
03:11:44,690 --> 03:11:45,630
They're running one tank now.

5185
03:11:46,690 --> 03:11:48,150
You can break that wall?

5186
03:11:50,230 --> 03:11:51,590
I've never seen that.

5187
03:11:51,730 --> 03:11:52,150
That's crazy.

5188
03:11:52,170 --> 03:11:53,930
They don't do it in Diamond, I guess.

5189
03:11:55,250 --> 03:11:56,610
Grandmaster, thank you.

5190
03:11:57,070 --> 03:11:58,170
Come here.

5191
03:11:58,170 --> 03:12:00,270
They're going to come here.

5192
03:12:00,950 --> 03:12:01,710
Get Punisher.

5193
03:12:03,870 --> 03:12:05,410
I'll hold this with him.

5194
03:12:06,450 --> 03:12:08,630
I'm going to drop and do a flank to you, okay?

5195
03:12:09,430 --> 03:12:09,750
I'm low.

5196
03:12:09,790 --> 03:12:10,710
Right here?

5197
03:12:11,610 --> 03:12:12,110
He stopped.

5198
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:15,190
Wolf missed.

5199
03:12:16,110 --> 03:12:16,550
Never mind.

5200
03:12:17,170 --> 03:12:19,190
I soul bonded us.

5201
03:12:20,070 --> 03:12:20,830
So we should win.

5202
03:12:21,390 --> 03:12:22,450
Okay, never mind.

5203
03:12:22,510 --> 03:12:23,330
Not me, I guess.

5204
03:12:25,110 --> 03:12:25,650
Oh, no.

5205
03:12:25,650 --> 03:12:27,070
Nice play.

5206
03:12:27,610 --> 03:12:27,750
Huge.

5207
03:12:29,170 --> 03:12:30,170
Fuck yeah.

5208
03:12:30,550 --> 03:12:32,970
I got double ulted there.

5209
03:12:33,090 --> 03:12:35,110
I got Mag fucking rocked.

5210
03:12:35,170 --> 03:12:36,630
And then Wolverine ulted.

5211
03:12:36,770 --> 03:12:39,610
I was like, that soul bond is not fucking saving me.

5212
03:12:39,990 --> 03:12:40,330
Wow, dude.

5213
03:12:41,550 --> 03:12:43,190
I had that all game.

5214
03:12:43,370 --> 03:12:44,530
I hadn't had to use it yet.

5215
03:12:47,370 --> 03:12:49,430
I didn't get to use my rez.

5216
03:12:52,390 --> 03:12:53,370
I feel disgusting.

5217
03:12:53,370 --> 03:12:54,690
This doesn't feel good.

5218
03:12:56,710 --> 03:12:58,610
Gomez, you need that.

5219
03:12:58,790 --> 03:13:00,830
You need to get to your tournament in time.

5220
03:13:01,110 --> 03:13:05,350
You need to get to your tournament in time.

5221
03:13:06,910 --> 03:13:08,990
I think we just portal.

5222
03:13:09,410 --> 03:13:10,170
I think we just portal.

5223
03:13:10,350 --> 03:13:11,390
I put my clones behind.

5224
03:13:11,650 --> 03:13:12,470
You guys flood in.

5225
03:13:12,530 --> 03:13:13,350
I just keep healing you guys.

5226
03:13:13,730 --> 03:13:16,450
And they can't do anything about that.

5227
03:13:16,550 --> 03:13:17,130
And you just flood in.

5228
03:13:17,130 --> 03:13:17,750
I follow after.

5229
03:13:19,010 --> 03:13:21,850
I'll soul link after your immortal is gone then.

5230
03:13:22,990 --> 03:13:24,390
I'll shift first into the portal.

5231
03:13:24,490 --> 03:13:26,010
You shift first, and then I'll soul link after.

5232
03:13:26,430 --> 03:13:26,990
Alright, got it.

5233
03:13:29,350 --> 03:13:30,710
Uh oh, only ult.

5234
03:13:31,970 --> 03:13:33,830
I can only do this as Luna.

5235
03:13:34,250 --> 03:13:35,330
Wait, check this out.

5236
03:13:36,190 --> 03:13:36,930
Oh, fuck.

5237
03:13:37,070 --> 03:13:37,210
Wait.

5238
03:13:38,390 --> 03:13:39,830
Somebody get up there, I'll jump to you.

5239
03:13:41,350 --> 03:13:42,310
Wait a minute.

5240
03:13:42,450 --> 03:13:44,390
Rocket's not bad, we can get armor pack right now.

5241
03:13:44,390 --> 03:13:44,550
Oh.

5242
03:13:46,670 --> 03:13:47,150
Wait.

5243
03:13:48,230 --> 03:13:49,250
Do it, do it, do it.

5244
03:13:49,910 --> 03:13:51,570
You're breaking your own code.

5245
03:13:51,770 --> 03:13:52,610
You're breaking the team code.

5246
03:13:53,050 --> 03:13:56,770
I don't want to be losers bracket, guys.

5247
03:13:57,910 --> 03:14:00,190
I'm going to cut off my hands after this tournament.

5248
03:14:02,990 --> 03:14:04,290
He can't get it.

5249
03:14:06,150 --> 03:14:09,190
I'm swapping in 3, 2, 1.

5250
03:14:11,290 --> 03:14:12,290
I'm going to walk up.

5251
03:14:12,290 --> 03:14:14,930
I'm going to walk up just to make sure they don't TP play.

5252
03:14:15,510 --> 03:14:16,450
And I just wasted my jump.

5253
03:14:16,610 --> 03:14:16,810
Okay.

5254
03:14:18,110 --> 03:14:19,370
Are we not TPing?

5255
03:14:19,410 --> 03:14:21,030
We are, we are, we are.

5256
03:14:21,330 --> 03:14:22,130
We walk up and TP.

5257
03:14:23,610 --> 03:14:26,290
They're on high ground, and TPing.

5258
03:14:29,250 --> 03:14:30,030
Get on there.

5259
03:14:32,390 --> 03:14:33,030
I go on.

5260
03:14:34,290 --> 03:14:36,290
So linked, you guys can push up if you want to.

5261
03:14:37,130 --> 03:14:37,350
Yeah.

5262
03:14:38,290 --> 03:14:39,450
Okay, we wait a little bit.

5263
03:14:39,450 --> 03:14:40,650
Can we get them?

5264
03:14:41,230 --> 03:14:42,690
There's a rocket revive thing.

5265
03:14:43,650 --> 03:14:44,450
She's behind, she's 1.

5266
03:14:46,230 --> 03:14:46,970
Okay, we just push it.

5267
03:14:47,190 --> 03:14:47,710
Push the front line.

5268
03:14:50,690 --> 03:14:51,290
Nice job.

5269
03:14:52,770 --> 03:14:53,570
Hello 1.

5270
03:14:54,150 --> 03:14:55,670
I'm dropping on point right now.

5271
03:14:57,030 --> 03:14:57,630
Yeah, I have shift.

5272
03:14:57,890 --> 03:14:58,450
Yeah, we're just in.

5273
03:14:58,770 --> 03:15:00,210
Okay, Punisher, Punisher dead.

5274
03:15:01,330 --> 03:15:03,290
Mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag, mag.

5275
03:15:03,290 --> 03:15:04,190
Mag's the one contesting point.

5276
03:15:04,310 --> 03:15:05,750
We're on the healers right now.

5277
03:15:05,750 --> 03:15:07,410
Okay, let's get it.

5278
03:15:08,150 --> 03:15:08,770
Good job.

5279
03:15:09,210 --> 03:15:10,410
Good job.

5280
03:15:12,070 --> 03:15:12,870
Let's go.

5281
03:15:13,510 --> 03:15:14,450
Is that what we needed?

5282
03:15:14,790 --> 03:15:16,770
Yeah, we just keep running this comp.

5283
03:15:18,310 --> 03:15:19,810
Oh, we're watching in this comp.

5284
03:15:19,990 --> 03:15:20,330
Oh boy.

5285
03:15:20,470 --> 03:15:21,150
Good shit.

5286
03:15:24,310 --> 03:15:25,290
Ghosts are back!

5287
03:15:31,410 --> 03:15:31,890
Yay!

5288
03:15:31,890 --> 03:15:32,110
Yay!

5289
03:15:32,170 --> 03:15:34,330
At least there's no Brig stunned.

5290
03:15:34,550 --> 03:15:34,950
Yeah.

5291
03:15:36,710 --> 03:15:40,030
Do we put Jay or just run Beto throughout for this comp?

5292
03:15:41,930 --> 03:15:42,670
I'll see you.

5293
03:15:44,010 --> 03:15:44,770
It's your call.

5294
03:15:44,870 --> 03:15:45,770
It's your call, Gomez.

5295
03:15:45,890 --> 03:15:46,630
You're the IGL.

5296
03:15:47,310 --> 03:15:48,470
This is your team.

5297
03:15:48,710 --> 03:15:49,610
You're the IGL.

5298
03:15:49,710 --> 03:15:50,550
You know more than me.

5299
03:15:51,370 --> 03:15:52,830
Okay, but you pick this team.

5300
03:15:53,190 --> 03:15:54,210
But you know more.

5301
03:15:55,470 --> 03:15:56,950
What would stomp this team more?

5302
03:15:59,090 --> 03:16:00,230
Because we need a Brig.

5303
03:16:00,250 --> 03:16:00,790
I think we keep it as it is.

5304
03:16:00,910 --> 03:16:02,950
Because if it's working this well, just don't...

5305
03:16:03,770 --> 03:16:04,750
Let's keep it this for now.

5306
03:16:04,910 --> 03:16:07,010
Because if this is life or death, losers are winners.

5307
03:16:07,230 --> 03:16:07,670
Yeah, yeah.

5308
03:16:07,910 --> 03:16:09,010
Okay, I'll let Jay know.

5309
03:16:09,810 --> 03:16:10,210
I'm staying?

5310
03:16:10,470 --> 03:16:11,750
Yeah, you're staying for this one.

5311
03:16:11,950 --> 03:16:14,670
Yeah, you're not going to get put in the streets.

5312
03:16:15,110 --> 03:16:15,290
Not yet.

5313
03:16:15,910 --> 03:16:19,390
Okay, let me see.

5314
03:16:19,450 --> 03:16:19,950
What's the next one?

5315
03:16:21,690 --> 03:16:22,250
Hell's Haven.

5316
03:16:23,150 --> 03:16:23,510
Hell's Haven.

5317
03:16:24,310 --> 03:16:24,870
Gross.

5318
03:16:26,050 --> 03:16:26,670
You don't like Hell's Haven?

5319
03:16:27,070 --> 03:16:27,510
No.

5320
03:16:28,190 --> 03:16:28,570
Really?

5321
03:16:29,590 --> 03:16:32,090
Oh, never mind.

5322
03:16:33,430 --> 03:16:34,430
I forgot you're a tank player.

5323
03:16:35,110 --> 03:16:37,270
You just get pulled off every tank battle.

5324
03:16:37,890 --> 03:16:39,430
I need to take a screenshot.

5325
03:16:41,450 --> 03:16:43,270
It's okay, we have the history.

5326
03:16:45,910 --> 03:16:47,030
Or whenever.

5327
03:16:53,470 --> 03:16:54,890
What's my stats for this?

5328
03:16:55,610 --> 03:16:56,390
It's alright.

5329
03:17:03,650 --> 03:17:04,130
Okay.

5330
03:17:06,710 --> 03:17:07,510
That's crazy.

5331
03:17:07,650 --> 03:17:09,730
One loss and we have a chance of going to losers bracket.

5332
03:17:10,110 --> 03:17:10,330
Yeah.

5333
03:17:10,690 --> 03:17:10,790
What?

5334
03:17:12,470 --> 03:17:13,230
That's insane.

5335
03:17:15,050 --> 03:17:15,530
Yeah.

5336
03:17:15,790 --> 03:17:17,810
Not even a full stat loss, just a single game.

5337
03:17:22,530 --> 03:17:23,230
They're ready.

5338
03:17:23,650 --> 03:17:24,530
Alright, cool.

5339
03:17:28,630 --> 03:17:30,590
Oh, this map, Namor is really good in.

5340
03:17:32,170 --> 03:17:33,390
But, they seem...

5341
03:17:33,390 --> 03:17:34,810
I don't know if they're going to ban Luna again this time.

5342
03:17:35,530 --> 03:17:35,750
Yeah.

5343
03:17:36,530 --> 03:17:38,570
I mean, we can just ban Luna and fuck over them.

5344
03:17:39,310 --> 03:17:39,570
Yeah.

5345
03:17:40,210 --> 03:17:44,530
I mean, if they don't protect Luna, we just ban her.

5346
03:17:50,850 --> 03:17:51,250
Sorry, sorry.

5347
03:17:52,610 --> 03:17:53,730
They're ready, by the way.

5348
03:17:54,170 --> 03:17:54,510
They're ready?

5349
03:17:54,670 --> 03:17:54,830
Okay.

5350
03:17:55,050 --> 03:17:55,410
Yeah.

5351
03:17:56,450 --> 03:17:56,610
Okay.

5352
03:18:01,330 --> 03:18:03,190
What was the ban line you guys were talking about?

5353
03:18:03,190 --> 03:18:03,590
What was it?

5354
03:18:03,830 --> 03:18:07,750
If they don't ban Luna, we can just ban her.

5355
03:18:08,770 --> 03:18:09,030
Alright.

5356
03:18:10,490 --> 03:18:11,270
I'm cool with that.

5357
03:18:13,470 --> 03:18:16,750
Cause I'd have to ban Mag or Starlord.

5358
03:18:17,330 --> 03:18:19,150
So, like, it doesn't matter for us.

5359
03:18:19,290 --> 03:18:19,870
I can do both.

5360
03:18:24,170 --> 03:18:25,010
Oh, okay.

5361
03:18:25,430 --> 03:18:26,570
Yeah, we can protect Mag again.

5362
03:18:28,110 --> 03:18:30,250
We banned Bucky last time.

5363
03:18:30,470 --> 03:18:30,950
That's fine.

5364
03:18:30,950 --> 03:18:32,250
I just keep it with that same ban.

5365
03:18:32,970 --> 03:18:34,390
Did I just hear that?

5366
03:18:34,650 --> 03:18:36,310
Yeah, that's...

5367
03:18:36,310 --> 03:18:38,070
That's Gomez's?

5368
03:18:38,250 --> 03:18:39,310
Holy shit.

5369
03:18:40,170 --> 03:18:41,070
And then protect Mag.

5370
03:18:42,390 --> 03:18:43,290
He's a yapper.

5371
03:18:44,830 --> 03:18:45,190
Picked him up.

5372
03:18:52,580 --> 03:18:55,120
I usually have a cat cam on, but...

5373
03:18:55,740 --> 03:18:56,820
They're doing Moon Knight.

5374
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:57,720
Should we ban Groot?

5375
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:01,500
I mean, we didn't ban Moon Knight last time.

5376
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:02,100
They banned Strange.

5377
03:19:02,100 --> 03:19:02,840
Strange dead.

5378
03:19:03,260 --> 03:19:05,580
They protected Moon Knight, so they might do Cheese.

5379
03:19:05,680 --> 03:19:06,480
Should we just ban Groot?

5380
03:19:08,140 --> 03:19:08,500
Sure.

5381
03:19:09,620 --> 03:19:11,080
Alright, yeah, fuck it.

5382
03:19:11,900 --> 03:19:12,580
Get Groot out.

5383
03:19:15,520 --> 03:19:17,080
So they can't do the combo, too.

5384
03:19:17,280 --> 03:19:19,240
They might try to do the Namor-Moon Knight combo.

5385
03:19:20,480 --> 03:19:20,820
Alright.

5386
03:19:22,720 --> 03:19:23,520
So they won't have two...

5387
03:19:23,520 --> 03:19:25,380
I'll switch back to Sue if we feel like we don't have the heals.

5388
03:19:25,700 --> 03:19:25,960
Yeah.

5389
03:19:27,700 --> 03:19:29,080
Wait, what am I on?

5390
03:19:29,080 --> 03:19:29,900
Are we doing...

5391
03:19:29,900 --> 03:19:31,380
What do you play?

5392
03:19:32,420 --> 03:19:34,720
We go 2-1-3?

5393
03:19:35,320 --> 03:19:36,200
Oh, we banned Bucky, too.

5394
03:19:36,380 --> 03:19:37,040
What the fuck?

5395
03:19:37,340 --> 03:19:39,640
We banned Bucky.

5396
03:19:40,820 --> 03:19:41,340
Namor?

5397
03:19:41,520 --> 03:19:42,380
Are you a Namor player?

5398
03:19:43,020 --> 03:19:43,440
Oh, no.

5399
03:19:44,140 --> 03:19:45,940
I don't touch that character.

5400
03:19:46,340 --> 03:19:46,960
Yes, you do.

5401
03:19:47,740 --> 03:19:49,240
He just hates Namor.

5402
03:19:52,660 --> 03:19:53,820
You know what?

5403
03:19:53,820 --> 03:19:54,220
I'll play Storm.

5404
03:19:54,760 --> 03:19:55,220
Storm?

5405
03:19:55,360 --> 03:19:55,560
Okay.

5406
03:19:56,380 --> 03:19:58,200
I'm just going to play in the middle of all of you, okay?

5407
03:20:00,900 --> 03:20:02,940
Whenever I call my ult, we just hard walk it, okay?

5408
03:20:03,560 --> 03:20:04,700
Wolverine is not bad.

5409
03:20:06,440 --> 03:20:07,320
That is true.

5410
03:20:08,900 --> 03:20:10,440
But Storm is super OP with this.

5411
03:20:10,800 --> 03:20:12,060
Do they have one or two tanks?

5412
03:20:12,680 --> 03:20:16,660
They have two, but they went 1-3-2 against our 3-3.

5413
03:20:17,240 --> 03:20:18,120
They adjusted, yeah.

5414
03:20:18,220 --> 03:20:20,880
Yeah, they were a strange mag at first.

5415
03:20:21,120 --> 03:20:21,440
You know what?

5416
03:20:21,440 --> 03:20:21,960
I trust them.

5417
03:20:22,460 --> 03:20:22,820
I'm doing it.

5418
03:20:23,320 --> 03:20:24,820
Do I put it on you or Coney?

5419
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:26,220
Or do I pull out the fantastic?

5420
03:20:26,540 --> 03:20:26,780
No.

5421
03:20:27,340 --> 03:20:28,020
We need to stop.

5422
03:20:28,580 --> 03:20:30,400
You don't want to do losers bracket.

5423
03:20:30,500 --> 03:20:31,360
You need to stop.

5424
03:20:32,800 --> 03:20:35,360
Don't you need it to leave at 3, bro?

5425
03:20:35,400 --> 03:20:35,680
Yeah.

5426
03:20:36,200 --> 03:20:41,660
If your team loses the tournament because you have to do a losers bracket in a VTuber tournament, that's on you.

5427
03:20:45,480 --> 03:20:46,640
That's on you.

5428
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:49,920
I'm waiting on you all.

5429
03:20:51,100 --> 03:20:51,840
They come through main.

5430
03:20:51,940 --> 03:20:53,120
If they come through main, I look for a pickup.

5431
03:20:54,600 --> 03:20:55,180
They're on main.

5432
03:20:55,640 --> 03:20:55,960
Okay.

5433
03:20:57,620 --> 03:20:58,240
Pick them up.

5434
03:21:03,060 --> 03:21:03,880
Keep pushing it.

5435
03:21:04,060 --> 03:21:04,440
Oh, they don't.

5436
03:21:04,580 --> 03:21:05,240
Oh, wait, bro.

5437
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:05,700
Holy.

5438
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:06,960
Storm's low.

5439
03:21:07,140 --> 03:21:07,320
Storm's low.

5440
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:07,720
Storm's low.

5441
03:21:09,020 --> 03:21:09,480
That's fine.

5442
03:21:09,900 --> 03:21:11,100
You died for the cost, Coney.

5443
03:21:12,400 --> 03:21:13,040
It's all good.

5444
03:21:13,160 --> 03:21:13,800
No, I was in there.

5445
03:21:15,760 --> 03:21:16,940
I was trying to clear the whole thing.

5446
03:21:16,940 --> 03:21:18,640
I thought it was an Ankh, but it was Storm's hammer.

5447
03:21:19,120 --> 03:21:20,460
Yeah, I saw that too.

5448
03:21:22,960 --> 03:21:25,560
You know what?

5449
03:21:25,600 --> 03:21:26,940
If he comes close enough...

5450
03:21:28,760 --> 03:21:30,000
I saw you.

5451
03:21:35,300 --> 03:21:37,020
Let's just go for a cocky play.

5452
03:21:40,600 --> 03:21:41,780
I'm doing something here.

5453
03:21:42,040 --> 03:21:42,580
Oh, they're going right.

5454
03:21:42,580 --> 03:21:43,540
Who's on top?

5455
03:21:44,620 --> 03:21:45,040
Right here.

5456
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:45,280
Right here.

5457
03:21:45,320 --> 03:21:45,600
One here.

5458
03:21:45,720 --> 03:21:46,000
Moon Knight.

5459
03:21:50,560 --> 03:21:51,120
Moon one.

5460
03:21:53,620 --> 03:21:53,840
Moon one.

5461
03:21:53,980 --> 03:21:54,200
Moon one.

5462
03:21:54,980 --> 03:21:55,540
Jhin died to that.

5463
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:57,700
I got split.

5464
03:21:57,840 --> 03:21:58,260
I got split.

5465
03:21:58,700 --> 03:21:59,660
Yeah, we got split by that.

5466
03:21:59,800 --> 03:22:00,520
I tried to back up.

5467
03:22:01,320 --> 03:22:01,840
Just get me up.

5468
03:22:03,380 --> 03:22:04,080
Yeah, Turret's out.

5469
03:22:04,120 --> 03:22:04,440
Turret's out.

5470
03:22:04,520 --> 03:22:04,800
Watch out.

5471
03:22:05,360 --> 03:22:05,700
I have ult.

5472
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:05,980
I have ult.

5473
03:22:06,160 --> 03:22:06,620
I'm pushing in.

5474
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:07,100
I'm pushing in with it.

5475
03:22:08,560 --> 03:22:09,220
I got you.

5476
03:22:09,260 --> 03:22:09,440
I got you.

5477
03:22:09,520 --> 03:22:09,720
I got you.

5478
03:22:09,720 --> 03:22:09,820
I got you.

5479
03:22:12,440 --> 03:22:13,720
Oh my god!

5480
03:22:14,920 --> 03:22:15,800
Holy shit!

5481
03:22:15,860 --> 03:22:16,320
Get that Thor!

5482
03:22:18,020 --> 03:22:19,840
There's a Thor right behind you!

5483
03:22:20,660 --> 03:22:21,680
See you guys.

5484
03:22:23,900 --> 03:22:25,480
Veno, you just let that Thor have it.

5485
03:22:25,540 --> 03:22:26,560
Giving you back shots.

5486
03:22:28,180 --> 03:22:31,380
He was literally giving you back shots when I was watching it.

5487
03:22:33,680 --> 03:22:35,340
Thank you for coming back for me, DonQ.

5488
03:22:35,440 --> 03:22:36,200
I was so scared.

5489
03:22:38,260 --> 03:22:39,720
Here, I pull him in.

5490
03:22:39,940 --> 03:22:40,380
Coney, Coney.

5491
03:22:40,640 --> 03:22:41,160
Actually, hold on.

5492
03:22:41,320 --> 03:22:42,880
You want to do something that I do with Hogs?

5493
03:22:43,140 --> 03:22:44,960
I'm going to fly in and then you ult them, okay?

5494
03:22:45,380 --> 03:22:45,640
Ready?

5495
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:46,880
Not yet.

5496
03:22:47,360 --> 03:22:48,300
Oh, not yet?

5497
03:22:48,420 --> 03:22:48,580
Okay.

5498
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:51,440
Oh shit!

5499
03:22:51,920 --> 03:22:56,200
Oh, I'm going to die.

5500
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:58,720
I was saying it wasn't us yet!

5501
03:22:59,140 --> 03:22:59,780
My bad.

5502
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:03,720
The Thor should die.

5503
03:23:04,500 --> 03:23:06,420
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

5504
03:23:06,620 --> 03:23:09,820
I'm going to keep you guys back here alive.

5505
03:23:10,040 --> 03:23:10,980
Okay, it's done, it's done.

5506
03:23:11,500 --> 03:23:12,720
Thor, Thor, Thor!

5507
03:23:14,660 --> 03:23:16,140
Just look for Rez here.

5508
03:23:16,500 --> 03:23:17,480
Kill the invisible.

5509
03:23:18,040 --> 03:23:18,580
No, cloak.

5510
03:23:18,900 --> 03:23:19,740
Fucking white women.

5511
03:23:24,200 --> 03:23:25,080
Get ready for Rez!

5512
03:23:25,180 --> 03:23:26,220
Get ready for Rez!

5513
03:23:26,220 --> 03:23:27,880
Rez, Rez, Rez!

5514
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:34,940
Their clothes!

5515
03:23:35,200 --> 03:23:36,620
Oh my god!

5516
03:23:38,120 --> 03:23:39,240
Holy shit!

5517
03:23:39,860 --> 03:23:43,340
I got you, I got you, I got you!

5518
03:23:43,540 --> 03:23:44,700
Guys, it's big.

5519
03:23:45,720 --> 03:23:46,940
It always is.

5520
03:23:47,320 --> 03:23:48,080
It always is.

5521
03:23:49,240 --> 03:23:51,900
Lime just fucking took me out of that.

5522
03:23:52,320 --> 03:23:54,000
I was like, what the fuck?

5523
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:59,500
I always confuse her with an invisible woman because they're both wearing white with blonde hair.

5524
03:24:03,800 --> 03:24:05,100
She's not playing around.

5525
03:24:05,100 --> 03:24:06,820
Sorry for stun locking you a little bit.

5526
03:24:07,120 --> 03:24:08,560
Guys, it's okay, we won.

5527
03:24:10,720 --> 03:24:11,840
Holy fuck.

5528
03:24:12,560 --> 03:24:13,620
That was wild.

5529
03:24:13,640 --> 03:24:14,640
Fucking white woman.

5530
03:24:17,120 --> 03:24:20,820
Lime does not represent the team, I have to disclaimer.

5531
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:27,240
If you have any complaints, please direct it to Limealicious on Twitch.

5532
03:24:31,180 --> 03:24:32,600
I thought you threw, bro.

5533
03:24:32,960 --> 03:24:34,240
I told you my ult wasn't up.

5534
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:37,680
Okay, Coney.

5535
03:24:38,760 --> 03:24:40,220
Just throw me out of spawn here, okay?

5536
03:24:40,560 --> 03:24:42,460
You have the freedom to just throw me.

5537
03:24:43,640 --> 03:24:45,660
I'll throw you and jump to you.

5538
03:24:49,960 --> 03:24:52,180
So go far left since we're running this comp.

5539
03:24:52,180 --> 03:24:54,260
Yeah, just throw me right here.

5540
03:24:54,560 --> 03:24:55,380
Like this?

5541
03:24:56,860 --> 03:24:57,620
Okay, well...

5542
03:24:57,620 --> 03:24:59,580
I didn't know how heavy you were!

5543
03:25:00,360 --> 03:25:01,340
Don't do this a lot!

5544
03:25:03,720 --> 03:25:05,120
They have Hawkeye, by the way.

5545
03:25:05,160 --> 03:25:05,820
Hawkeye, Storm.

5546
03:25:08,200 --> 03:25:10,220
I did not mean to go up this much.

5547
03:25:11,180 --> 03:25:13,000
Careful of Storm one shots.

5548
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:14,400
Look for my grabs here, okay?

5549
03:25:14,460 --> 03:25:14,680
You ready?

5550
03:25:15,440 --> 03:25:16,040
Oh, actually.

5551
03:25:16,880 --> 03:25:17,660
Got him, got him, got him.

5552
03:25:17,660 --> 03:25:20,200
Look at him, look at him.

5553
03:25:20,620 --> 03:25:21,940
I'm scratching him.

5554
03:25:22,120 --> 03:25:22,560
I'm scratching him.

5555
03:25:22,780 --> 03:25:23,380
I'm ulting this.

5556
03:25:23,960 --> 03:25:24,460
I'm scratching him.

5557
03:25:24,460 --> 03:25:26,520
I'm scratching him.

5558
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:31,180
This is actually a hydrogen bomb right now.

5559
03:25:32,660 --> 03:25:33,740
Holy shit!

5560
03:25:34,040 --> 03:25:35,940
Here's our hydrogen bomb.

5561
03:25:37,240 --> 03:25:38,620
Oh my god.

5562
03:25:39,120 --> 03:25:40,140
Shouldn't have banned Starlord.

5563
03:25:40,480 --> 03:25:41,660
Yeah, shouldn't have banned Starlord.

5564
03:25:42,060 --> 03:25:43,160
Did he break this right here?

5565
03:25:43,160 --> 03:25:44,280
Yeah, yeah.

5566
03:25:44,440 --> 03:25:46,720
We don't break the whole thing.

5567
03:25:46,860 --> 03:25:48,960
We break the top so he can stand on top of it next time.

5568
03:25:49,880 --> 03:25:52,760
Yeah, yeah, just break the top.

5569
03:25:54,700 --> 03:25:55,680
There's a Thor on the right.

5570
03:25:56,640 --> 03:25:57,720
One here, one here.

5571
03:25:58,500 --> 03:25:59,180
He's stuck.

5572
03:26:00,920 --> 03:26:01,660
He's scared.

5573
03:26:03,120 --> 03:26:03,940
I don't have leap.

5574
03:26:05,200 --> 03:26:06,400
Thor to the left, Thor to the left.

5575
03:26:07,280 --> 03:26:08,740
I don't have...

5576
03:26:08,740 --> 03:26:09,500
You copy me whenever.

5577
03:26:09,500 --> 03:26:10,320
You copy me whenever.

5578
03:26:10,780 --> 03:26:11,700
I'm doing it now.

5579
03:26:13,640 --> 03:26:14,480
Walking hard.

5580
03:26:14,940 --> 03:26:15,740
Walking hard.

5581
03:26:16,580 --> 03:26:17,760
I got moonlighted.

5582
03:26:21,240 --> 03:26:23,000
I'm healing now.

5583
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:23,580
I'm still healing.

5584
03:26:24,880 --> 03:26:26,260
Starlord should be 1HP.

5585
03:26:28,100 --> 03:26:29,220
I'm looking.

5586
03:26:31,440 --> 03:26:32,600
I got moon.

5587
03:26:36,460 --> 03:26:37,800
Nice, good job.

5588
03:26:38,020 --> 03:26:38,820
Nice, nice, nice.

5589
03:26:39,760 --> 03:26:41,200
I got ult up for this next one.

5590
03:26:42,140 --> 03:26:42,540
Alright.

5591
03:26:43,140 --> 03:26:44,600
I'm gonna go high ground now.

5592
03:26:45,540 --> 03:26:47,240
I got ult for cloak and dagger.

5593
03:26:48,460 --> 03:26:49,960
I'm too fucking short.

5594
03:26:51,900 --> 03:26:54,780
I can't make this fucking jump.

5595
03:26:54,780 --> 03:26:57,140
Fucking Wolverine debuff.

5596
03:27:00,100 --> 03:27:02,360
Here, Coney, we can do the thing here.

5597
03:27:02,940 --> 03:27:04,100
Alright, let's get it.

5598
03:27:04,480 --> 03:27:04,980
Let's go.

5599
03:27:07,080 --> 03:27:08,360
Oh my god, we missed.

5600
03:27:08,860 --> 03:27:09,080
Oh god.

5601
03:27:10,580 --> 03:27:11,340
I'm fucking dead.

5602
03:27:11,860 --> 03:27:14,180
I got one.

5603
03:27:17,220 --> 03:27:20,160
You got this, you got this.

5604
03:27:20,200 --> 03:27:21,500
Just hit him, just hit him.

5605
03:27:21,500 --> 03:27:22,540
Nice, good job, good job.

5606
03:27:22,700 --> 03:27:25,140
Got the invisible one.

5607
03:27:27,580 --> 03:27:28,540
I clobbered them.

5608
03:27:28,880 --> 03:27:29,840
We just clobbered them.

5609
03:27:33,280 --> 03:27:35,380
Oh yeah, Wolverine is 5 foot 4.

5610
03:27:35,860 --> 03:27:37,500
5 foot 4 problems.

5611
03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:40,620
That was the stomp you want.

5612
03:27:40,720 --> 03:27:42,180
That was literally 100-100.

5613
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:45,600
We have to stomp the next one.

5614
03:27:45,720 --> 03:27:47,020
I think we have another round too.

5615
03:27:47,120 --> 03:27:48,560
So we gotta stomp another one too.

5616
03:27:51,500 --> 03:27:52,900
I guess the same guys are different people.

5617
03:27:53,080 --> 03:27:55,100
I don't know, we gotta see what...

5618
03:27:55,100 --> 03:27:56,860
We see how they win their games.

5619
03:27:57,340 --> 03:28:02,860
Because if there's another team that won all their games except for one tiebreaker then we fight them.

5620
03:28:04,220 --> 03:28:05,500
Okay, let me...

5621
03:28:06,460 --> 03:28:09,340
Because if there isn't, I believe we might fight the same team then.

5622
03:28:12,260 --> 03:28:12,660
Okay.

5623
03:28:15,280 --> 03:28:15,680
Alright.

5624
03:28:16,440 --> 03:28:17,840
I put it in our score.

5625
03:28:24,210 --> 03:28:24,890
Nice.

5626
03:28:25,370 --> 03:28:26,610
We're doing good.

5627
03:28:26,830 --> 03:28:27,810
We're adapting.

5628
03:28:28,630 --> 03:28:29,810
We are doing pretty good.

5629
03:28:29,950 --> 03:28:31,390
We're adapting guys.

5630
03:28:32,110 --> 03:28:32,970
I don't wanna say it.

5631
03:28:33,390 --> 03:28:34,250
Don't jinx us.

5632
03:28:36,730 --> 03:28:38,250
We're doing fantastic.

5633
03:28:39,070 --> 03:28:40,530
Say that again.

5634
03:28:41,050 --> 03:28:42,170
Say that again.

5635
03:28:46,490 --> 03:28:47,710
Let's see.

5636
03:28:48,470 --> 03:28:49,630
Are they fighting?

5637
03:28:49,830 --> 03:28:50,670
Oh shit!

5638
03:28:51,190 --> 03:28:51,570
Wait!

5639
03:28:52,690 --> 03:28:53,470
Oh!

5640
03:28:54,770 --> 03:28:55,550
The...

5641
03:28:55,550 --> 03:29:02,730
The Oni inmates lost one game to one of their...

5642
03:29:02,730 --> 03:29:04,390
to the mission windows.

5643
03:29:05,070 --> 03:29:07,150
So we're up one point against them.

5644
03:29:07,850 --> 03:29:08,070
Cool.

5645
03:29:09,530 --> 03:29:12,130
We have to stomp round 5 too.

5646
03:29:12,790 --> 03:29:13,950
We will.

5647
03:29:14,690 --> 03:29:16,250
Then we get the winner's bracket.

5648
03:29:17,650 --> 03:29:17,870
Alright.

5649
03:29:17,870 --> 03:29:19,470
I got a pee break.

5650
03:29:19,690 --> 03:29:20,290
I'll be right back.

5651
03:29:22,750 --> 03:29:23,990
Am I leaving?

5652
03:29:25,810 --> 03:29:27,690
We should probably swap now, right?

5653
03:29:28,110 --> 03:29:28,410
Yeah.

5654
03:29:28,810 --> 03:29:30,530
If that works.

5655
03:29:31,330 --> 03:29:32,510
Whatever you guys wanna do.

5656
03:29:32,870 --> 03:29:36,650
I'm always down to just keep playing, but Jay's in prison.

5657
03:29:37,830 --> 03:29:38,570
No, Jay.

5658
03:29:38,750 --> 03:29:39,510
Jay, no.

5659
03:29:39,790 --> 03:29:40,590
They're mopping out their sentences.

5660
03:29:49,170 --> 03:29:53,230
I can't believe Rebels made me have to actually watch out what I say now.

5661
03:29:54,790 --> 03:29:57,150
I can't say okay, here's the thing.

5662
03:29:57,510 --> 03:30:01,030
Or I can't say fucking...

5663
03:30:01,030 --> 03:30:02,430
No, I think that's the only thing, right?

5664
03:30:03,290 --> 03:30:03,690
Fantastic.

5665
03:30:04,650 --> 03:30:06,050
Can't say fantastic anymore.

5666
03:30:07,670 --> 03:30:09,930
I guess there's a new one that's happening right now.

5667
03:30:09,990 --> 03:30:10,230
Soup.

5668
03:30:10,510 --> 03:30:10,850
I don't know.

5669
03:30:11,730 --> 03:30:12,830
From fucking Human Torch.

5670
03:30:13,610 --> 03:30:15,490
Yeah, Human Torch just says soup if he dies.

5671
03:30:16,570 --> 03:30:17,390
Oh, that's right.

5672
03:30:18,030 --> 03:30:19,290
I heard the Venom wee.

5673
03:30:19,290 --> 03:30:20,530
That one's pretty funny.

5674
03:30:21,030 --> 03:30:23,050
That one's strange.

5675
03:30:23,230 --> 03:30:23,670
It says bye.

5676
03:30:24,010 --> 03:30:24,910
I love the bye.

5677
03:30:24,990 --> 03:30:25,250
Bye.

5678
03:30:25,490 --> 03:30:25,810
Bye.

5679
03:30:30,130 --> 03:30:37,910
I always laugh when Starlord gets dunked because his is like such a big show of everything and then no.

5680
03:30:38,950 --> 03:30:40,330
I hate that all.

5681
03:30:41,690 --> 03:30:42,510
You don't like it?

5682
03:30:42,870 --> 03:30:44,290
It scares me.

5683
03:30:44,290 --> 03:30:45,530
It's scary.

5684
03:30:47,010 --> 03:30:48,110
But you know what counters it?

5685
03:30:48,130 --> 03:30:49,230
I like it when he says legend.

5686
03:30:49,710 --> 03:30:51,290
I like that part.

5687
03:30:51,510 --> 03:30:55,670
As long as we have a support op for a Starlord ult, we counter it.

5688
03:30:58,530 --> 03:31:01,250
Are we the first team that finished both?

5689
03:31:01,850 --> 03:31:02,450
Yeah, we are.

5690
03:31:02,530 --> 03:31:02,770
Probably.

5691
03:31:03,410 --> 03:31:03,870
We are.

5692
03:31:03,930 --> 03:31:04,630
I'm looking at it.

5693
03:31:04,810 --> 03:31:10,170
Only one team has done one and then...

5694
03:31:10,170 --> 03:31:11,890
Yeah, everyone else is still on their second matches.

5695
03:31:16,040 --> 03:31:18,480
So, I think it's Cultist.

5696
03:31:20,960 --> 03:31:22,460
Yeah, we currently have...

5697
03:31:22,460 --> 03:31:24,480
We're currently have...

5698
03:31:24,480 --> 03:31:26,940
We're currently rank one right now in our group.

5699
03:31:29,620 --> 03:31:36,620
And for winner's bracket, if we win all of them and we get to winner's bracket, we fight Group G.

5700
03:31:38,180 --> 03:31:41,420
And Group G's best player is...

5701
03:31:41,420 --> 03:31:43,400
Oh, they have been undefeated.

5702
03:31:43,400 --> 03:31:47,040
Their best team has been undefeated so far.

5703
03:31:47,880 --> 03:31:49,360
I'm looking them up.

5704
03:31:49,920 --> 03:31:50,800
Wow.

5705
03:31:51,520 --> 03:31:51,920
Yeah.

5706
03:31:52,360 --> 03:31:54,880
What are they called?

5707
03:31:55,460 --> 03:31:56,600
The Schlongschlots.

5708
03:32:00,040 --> 03:32:05,660
If anyone wants to analyze their team later...

5709
03:32:05,660 --> 03:32:06,520
I'll do it.

5710
03:32:07,200 --> 03:32:08,200
That's my job.

5711
03:32:09,260 --> 03:32:10,740
This is their handles.

5712
03:32:13,740 --> 03:32:14,160
Let's see.

5713
03:32:14,240 --> 03:32:15,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

5714
03:32:15,780 --> 03:32:15,960
Yeah.

5715
03:32:16,700 --> 03:32:17,500
This is them.

5716
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:22,800
That's the team that we're gonna fight.

5717
03:32:24,900 --> 03:32:25,620
We're winners.

5718
03:32:33,310 --> 03:32:33,670
Um...

5719
03:32:33,670 --> 03:32:35,570
Yeah, Mace's team is undefeated, by the way.

5720
03:32:42,670 --> 03:32:43,390
Mace's team...

5721
03:32:43,390 --> 03:32:44,510
I mean, we could have been undefeated.

5722
03:32:44,570 --> 03:32:45,830
I'm not too worried about that.

5723
03:32:45,990 --> 03:32:47,890
It was just like...

5724
03:32:47,890 --> 03:32:50,190
We just got cheesed.

5725
03:32:50,330 --> 03:32:50,470
Yeah.

5726
03:32:50,910 --> 03:32:51,430
It's all good.

5727
03:32:51,810 --> 03:32:52,130
Yeah.

5728
03:32:53,870 --> 03:32:55,490
Uh, wait a minute.

5729
03:32:56,110 --> 03:32:56,530
Wow.

5730
03:32:59,970 --> 03:33:00,530
Interesting.

5731
03:33:00,770 --> 03:33:01,030
Okay.

5732
03:33:01,410 --> 03:33:03,330
Trying to see if...

5733
03:33:03,330 --> 03:33:03,830
Oh, yeah.

5734
03:33:04,650 --> 03:33:05,210
Uh...

5735
03:33:05,210 --> 03:33:05,690
Oh!

5736
03:33:06,310 --> 03:33:09,970
Wait, the team that we thought was the hardest team...

5737
03:33:09,970 --> 03:33:10,570
They also have a tie.

5738
03:33:10,710 --> 03:33:11,890
They weren't undefeated.

5739
03:33:11,990 --> 03:33:12,710
They had one tie.

5740
03:33:13,550 --> 03:33:14,030
Yeah.

5741
03:33:14,030 --> 03:33:14,690
Yeah.

5742
03:33:15,670 --> 03:33:16,750
They had one tie.

5743
03:33:16,870 --> 03:33:18,050
Who did they tie against?

5744
03:33:21,950 --> 03:33:22,990
That's interesting.

5745
03:33:24,030 --> 03:33:25,230
Tied against somebody.

5746
03:33:32,300 --> 03:33:32,820
Uh...

5747
03:33:37,890 --> 03:33:38,410
Analyzing...

5748
03:33:38,410 --> 03:33:40,190
Can I let Jay into the call?

5749
03:33:41,350 --> 03:33:43,270
Depends on which team we're fighting, though.

5750
03:33:43,430 --> 03:33:45,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5751
03:33:45,930 --> 03:33:46,790
We don't know who we're fighting.

5752
03:33:46,870 --> 03:33:50,850
Because if we're fighting against the Oni people, we keep you in.

5753
03:33:51,390 --> 03:33:51,830
Okay.

5754
03:33:54,290 --> 03:33:56,090
I'm assuming... I will be right back.

5755
03:33:57,010 --> 03:33:57,270
Okay.

5756
03:34:00,190 --> 03:34:00,790
Um...

5757
03:34:00,790 --> 03:34:02,810
I'm glad we're improving every game, Chat.

5758
03:34:03,050 --> 03:34:12,270
I'm gonna mess up, but I'm really happy that every game, we're just... Our team is just getting like, better and better.

5759
03:34:12,790 --> 03:34:15,370
So, like, I'm very happy about it.

5760
03:34:16,250 --> 03:34:18,450
And we're adapting really well.

5761
03:34:19,790 --> 03:34:20,150
So...

5762
03:34:20,150 --> 03:34:20,670
Yeah.

5763
03:34:22,750 --> 03:34:23,110
We're...

5764
03:34:23,110 --> 03:34:26,490
Uh... Yeah, the team, we're improving, and we're all adapting incredibly well.

5765
03:34:26,670 --> 03:34:29,010
A lot of teams in this tournament have been trying so hard.

5766
03:34:29,130 --> 03:34:29,930
They've been, like, scrimming.

5767
03:34:30,010 --> 03:34:31,810
Like, some teams have been scrimming every day.

5768
03:34:32,010 --> 03:34:35,610
But our team, obviously, like, all of us are incredibly busy people, too.

5769
03:34:35,690 --> 03:34:39,390
So, I'm happy we're able to... Everybody took it really seriously, too, on our team.

5770
03:34:39,550 --> 03:34:44,890
And we all, like, uh... You know, we all did, like, we did four to five scrims together before the tournament.

5771
03:34:47,270 --> 03:34:47,630
Uh...

5772
03:34:47,630 --> 03:34:49,890
And, uh...

5773
03:34:50,790 --> 03:35:01,630
And... And we managed to, you know, I'm glad we managed to get practice in and managed to, you know, get a feel of each other and, like, get, like, you know, cover our weaknesses before...

5774
03:35:02,550 --> 03:35:05,550
Cover our weaknesses and everything, uh, going in.

5775
03:35:05,550 --> 03:35:06,550
We still got a couple minutes, right?

5776
03:35:06,970 --> 03:35:09,850
Yeah, like, they haven't even finished their game yet.

5777
03:35:10,450 --> 03:35:10,910
Okay, cool.

5778
03:35:10,950 --> 03:35:11,630
I'll be right back one sec.

5779
03:35:11,890 --> 03:35:12,410
Yeah, yeah.

5780
03:35:12,650 --> 03:35:14,290
So, a lot of teams are still fighting.

5781
03:35:18,610 --> 03:35:19,490
Um... But, yeah.

5782
03:35:19,930 --> 03:35:21,430
I'm just... I'm just happy.

5783
03:35:21,750 --> 03:35:26,370
And, you know, my first couple of games I was super... I'm more comfortable right now.

5784
03:35:26,530 --> 03:35:30,870
I'm more comfortable and, like, my first couple of games, I definitely made a lot of mistakes.

5785
03:35:31,090 --> 03:35:31,490
I was...

5786
03:35:31,490 --> 03:35:34,550
I mean, I made a lot of mistakes.

5787
03:35:34,650 --> 03:35:35,450
I'm not...

5788
03:35:35,450 --> 03:35:36,730
I'm not, like... I'm not tired.

5789
03:35:36,830 --> 03:35:37,950
I've hit my second win.

5790
03:35:38,070 --> 03:35:39,430
I've definitely hit my second win now.

5791
03:35:39,510 --> 03:35:40,630
So, like, I'm okay now.

5792
03:35:41,110 --> 03:35:41,250
I...

5793
03:35:44,350 --> 03:35:46,090
I also didn't warm up going in.

5794
03:35:46,290 --> 03:35:48,910
Like, the first game was my fucking warm up game.

5795
03:35:51,270 --> 03:35:51,750
Um...

5796
03:35:51,750 --> 03:35:52,190
But, yeah.

5797
03:35:52,470 --> 03:35:56,030
I'm just... I'm just happy with how well we're doing so far.

5798
03:35:56,170 --> 03:35:59,290
I'm gonna check if we are playing four or five teams.

5799
03:35:59,830 --> 03:36:01,610
Because, like, I'm so confused.

5800
03:36:03,590 --> 03:36:04,070
I'm...

5801
03:36:04,070 --> 03:36:05,290
I'm a little... Okay, yeah.

5802
03:36:05,390 --> 03:36:06,910
Round... Wait, is it round five?

5803
03:36:07,570 --> 03:36:08,510
Okay, match five.

5804
03:36:08,570 --> 03:36:10,390
Okay, we do play five teams.

5805
03:36:11,290 --> 03:36:12,290
Oh, okay.

5806
03:36:12,290 --> 03:36:15,510
I wonder who we play against.

5807
03:36:17,950 --> 03:36:18,550
Uh...

5808
03:36:20,350 --> 03:36:20,950
Uh...

5809
03:36:20,950 --> 03:36:22,290
Yeah, I was...

5810
03:36:22,290 --> 03:36:24,590
I was nervous as fuck starting.

5811
03:36:25,130 --> 03:36:34,690
But, because it's always, like, you know, the first... the first tournament always makes me incredibly... Like, it's my first actual Marvel Rivals tournament, so I'm so fucking...

5812
03:36:34,690 --> 03:36:36,230
I'm so nervous.

5813
03:36:36,550 --> 03:36:39,030
But, I'm now... I'm definitely more comfortable.

5814
03:36:41,550 --> 03:36:43,550
I'm definitely getting more comfortable now.

5815
03:36:46,330 --> 03:36:47,350
Also, why swapping out?

5816
03:36:48,070 --> 03:36:50,430
Um, Beto was originally gonna be on day two only.

5817
03:36:51,170 --> 03:36:55,350
And, um, so, but, uh, the thing he was gonna do on the...

5818
03:36:55,350 --> 03:36:58,130
but then something that he could... he could come in day one.

5819
03:36:58,370 --> 03:37:01,870
And so, like, because the thing he was gonna do on day one got rescheduled.

5820
03:37:02,250 --> 03:37:07,130
And we swapped between the two because Beto and Jay are both...

5821
03:37:07,130 --> 03:37:10,350
because, like, Beto and Jay are both special specialists on different tanks.

5822
03:37:11,130 --> 03:37:20,130
So, if, like, Beto is getting hard-targeted banned, we'll swap in Jay because, like, Jay has, like, a different hero pool than Beto.

5823
03:37:20,670 --> 03:37:22,610
And so, like, that's why...

5824
03:37:22,610 --> 03:37:28,850
Yeah, and then Coney's hero pool overlaps with both Beto and Jay.

5825
03:37:29,110 --> 03:37:30,590
So, like, we could keep Coney.

5826
03:37:30,830 --> 03:37:32,650
We just have to swap between Beto and Jay.

5827
03:37:32,890 --> 03:37:35,730
So, like, they can't analyze our team that well.

5828
03:37:35,830 --> 03:37:42,550
So, like, during day two it's harder to analyze our team because, like, we don't know which tank we're gonna put in.

5829
03:37:44,370 --> 03:37:53,390
So, like, if we want to put in... Obviously, if we want to put in, like, a strange player, we'll put in Jay.

5830
03:37:53,510 --> 03:37:56,750
But we want to put in, like, you know, like, Jay...

5831
03:37:56,750 --> 03:38:00,950
Not just strange, but he basically plays the heroes that Beto doesn't play.

5832
03:38:01,170 --> 03:38:02,850
And then Beto plays... Yeah, we can do that.

5833
03:38:02,870 --> 03:38:03,950
We can swap subs.

5834
03:38:04,270 --> 03:38:06,370
We can swap players in between matches.

5835
03:38:09,730 --> 03:38:11,190
Because tournaments have that too.

5836
03:38:11,290 --> 03:38:13,690
That's why, like, in the official tournaments you'll see teams.

5837
03:38:13,790 --> 03:38:16,350
They'll have, like, specialists and stuff for certain characters.

5838
03:38:16,750 --> 03:38:21,150
So, like, if they want to swap, like, maybe, like, what team?

5839
03:38:21,250 --> 03:38:23,770
The European team that won first.

5840
03:38:24,770 --> 03:38:25,450
I forgot.

5841
03:38:25,570 --> 03:38:26,670
I know they're signed to...

5842
03:38:26,670 --> 03:38:29,730
They're signed to Virtus.pro I think now.

5843
03:38:29,830 --> 03:38:30,150
I don't know.

5844
03:38:30,190 --> 03:38:30,530
I don't remember.

5845
03:38:30,910 --> 03:38:34,650
But the EU team that won the MCR, they have several specialists.

5846
03:38:35,030 --> 03:38:36,590
So they have, like, you guys don't know...

5847
03:38:36,590 --> 03:38:37,530
You guys remember Healus?

5848
03:38:37,870 --> 03:38:39,010
He's on that team.

5849
03:38:39,450 --> 03:38:42,070
And he's their Wolverine magic specialist.

5850
03:38:42,390 --> 03:38:47,570
So they're trying to run comps for, like, you know, they're trying to run comps that require Wolverine or magic.

5851
03:38:48,010 --> 03:38:51,110
Healus gets put in as their, like, specialist and stuff like that.

5852
03:38:52,610 --> 03:38:55,530
So, like, a lot of, like, hero shooters have that.

5853
03:38:55,750 --> 03:38:58,970
Because no one person can cover all characters.

5854
03:38:59,530 --> 03:39:05,530
Like, it's that it's so difficult to be, like, the best at every single character in your role.

5855
03:39:06,570 --> 03:39:07,010
So...

5856
03:39:09,030 --> 03:39:10,030
So, yeah.

5857
03:39:10,270 --> 03:39:12,770
So, like, it's good to have players to cover your weakness.

5858
03:39:13,070 --> 03:39:21,890
Originally, originally Beto was supposed to only play on day 2 but since he could come on day 1 then, like, obviously why don't we take advantage of that, you know?

5859
03:39:21,990 --> 03:39:24,350
Like, the fact that we could have two tank players rotate.

5860
03:39:24,590 --> 03:39:26,510
We might as well take advantage of that.

5861
03:39:33,940 --> 03:39:34,380
Yeah.

5862
03:39:35,900 --> 03:39:39,100
Like, obviously I could try and play as many supports as possible.

5863
03:39:39,220 --> 03:39:41,120
But, like I said, Adam's not my best support.

5864
03:39:41,260 --> 03:39:44,940
But, like, I can still play him in my rank.

5865
03:39:45,080 --> 03:39:49,280
I just, you know, I'm basically the Luna specialist on my team.

5866
03:39:49,500 --> 03:39:52,820
But I can still swap in between other roles if needed.

5867
03:39:54,260 --> 03:39:56,400
Because, like, so they can't target ban me.

5868
03:39:57,100 --> 03:39:58,380
Like, you know, like...

5869
03:40:03,450 --> 03:40:04,370
Who thought of this?

5870
03:40:04,410 --> 03:40:04,810
Was it you?

5871
03:40:04,870 --> 03:40:08,410
I mean, when Beto said that he could come on day 1 I was just like, we'll just rotate tanks.

5872
03:40:09,030 --> 03:40:11,970
We'll just rotate tanks so day 2 would be harder for people to analyze us.

5873
03:40:13,170 --> 03:40:15,430
Because we can play different comps.

5874
03:40:15,750 --> 03:40:19,990
Like, we actually didn't, we haven't pulled out a comp that we practiced on scrims yet.

5875
03:40:20,690 --> 03:40:22,370
There's one comp we haven't pulled.

5876
03:40:22,470 --> 03:40:25,390
Like, I mean, there's two comps we haven't pulled out yet.

5877
03:40:29,310 --> 03:40:33,830
So, like, because, like, obviously we don't need to pull it out.

5878
03:40:33,930 --> 03:40:35,050
We don't need to use it yet.

5879
03:40:37,810 --> 03:40:40,530
But yeah, no, this tournament was a lot sweatier.

5880
03:40:41,650 --> 03:40:43,510
I mean, I knew it was going to be really sweaty.

5881
03:40:43,710 --> 03:40:45,250
I knew it was going to be incredibly sweaty.

5882
03:40:45,790 --> 03:40:51,210
But, like, this tournament was definitely more sweaty than I expected.

5883
03:40:57,690 --> 03:41:01,530
It was more sweaty than I actually expected it to be.

5884
03:41:06,250 --> 03:41:07,150
I'm having fun.

5885
03:41:07,250 --> 03:41:09,730
No, it's competitive and competitive is always really fun.

5886
03:41:10,090 --> 03:41:11,330
It's always really, really fun.

5887
03:41:11,410 --> 03:41:13,030
I just get way too competitive, though.

5888
03:41:13,330 --> 03:41:20,690
That's, like, my biggest fault, is that I get way too competitive during these.

5889
03:41:20,710 --> 03:41:22,630
So you can tell I'm, like, more serious and stuff.

5890
03:41:23,530 --> 03:41:29,810
I still, like, try to make jokes every so often, but I'm just a very competitive person in general.

5891
03:41:30,750 --> 03:41:32,670
So I get, like, super focused and everything.

5892
03:41:37,170 --> 03:41:45,470
Yeah, and also, like, I know that because I'm considered, like, you know, like, the higher, like, me and Gomez are both the high rankers on our team.

5893
03:41:45,550 --> 03:41:46,870
Also, where's the leaderboard right now?

5894
03:41:47,570 --> 03:41:48,570
Am I, like, still safe?

5895
03:41:48,630 --> 03:41:49,070
I am.

5896
03:41:49,170 --> 03:41:49,450
Okay.

5897
03:41:49,910 --> 03:41:57,930
I need to play rank soon, because, like, it says that I haven't played rank in four days, so I need to play rank, like, either today or tomorrow.

5898
03:42:00,310 --> 03:42:01,510
I hope I don't get dropped.

5899
03:42:01,630 --> 03:42:02,530
No, I can play tomorrow.

5900
03:42:02,530 --> 03:42:08,090
So, like, if I do lose that, I don't want to lose my one above all.

5901
03:42:11,190 --> 03:42:13,650
I don't want to keep my one above all.

5902
03:42:13,770 --> 03:42:17,430
I don't want to lose it during... I don't want to lose it for day two.

5903
03:42:17,710 --> 03:42:18,510
I'll just do it tomorrow.

5904
03:42:19,070 --> 03:42:21,050
I'll just do it after the tournament tomorrow.

5905
03:42:24,430 --> 03:42:27,890
No, yeah, if you're in Eternity, there's rank decay.

5906
03:42:29,430 --> 03:42:29,950
So, yeah.

5907
03:42:30,230 --> 03:42:32,030
I haven't been playing a lot on my main, though.

5908
03:42:33,130 --> 03:42:35,490
Just because I'm very busy and everything.

5909
03:42:36,610 --> 03:42:37,970
I've been too busy.

5910
03:42:39,190 --> 03:42:43,590
I've been playing on my ult accounts, just because, like, I don't want to try too hard.

5911
03:42:44,250 --> 03:42:45,710
So I just play on my ults.

5912
03:42:48,940 --> 03:42:50,920
What's my second favorite strategist after Luna?

5913
03:42:53,580 --> 03:42:54,100
Um...

5914
03:42:55,080 --> 03:42:55,940
None of them.

5915
03:42:59,400 --> 03:43:01,340
I don't really... I don't know.

5916
03:43:01,480 --> 03:43:03,500
I like Luna's kit the most.

5917
03:43:04,180 --> 03:43:09,420
The other support supports I play just because, like, just because I have to.

5918
03:43:09,820 --> 03:43:11,540
Just, like, because it's, like, support meta.

5919
03:43:12,260 --> 03:43:14,240
I know why I say I hate the most Rocket.

5920
03:43:14,760 --> 03:43:18,580
I got cut off my hands after this tournament because I fucking tainted myself.

5921
03:43:21,540 --> 03:43:26,360
I think Luna's kit is the most fun out of all of the characters so far.

5922
03:43:27,160 --> 03:43:29,600
Unless Professor Xavier is...

5923
03:43:30,340 --> 03:43:33,740
When Professor Xavier comes out, he's gonna be my second favorite.

5924
03:43:34,020 --> 03:43:35,560
Who the hell is Super Gooner?

5925
03:43:36,580 --> 03:43:38,200
And Ultra Cool Sigma.

5926
03:43:38,920 --> 03:43:41,280
What the fuck?

5927
03:43:41,700 --> 03:43:42,680
Wait, who are these guys?

5928
03:43:43,760 --> 03:43:45,760
It's open to all!

5929
03:43:46,260 --> 03:43:47,860
Oh my god!

5930
03:43:48,320 --> 03:43:49,320
Oh my god!

5931
03:43:49,680 --> 03:43:50,120
Gomez!

5932
03:43:51,640 --> 03:43:54,040
What the hell, bro?

5933
03:43:58,540 --> 03:44:00,440
How did they get in?

5934
03:44:00,660 --> 03:44:01,900
Who leaves the couch?

5935
03:44:03,880 --> 03:44:05,760
You should sub someone out for that guy.

5936
03:44:07,120 --> 03:44:08,620
Super Gooner, man.

5937
03:44:10,400 --> 03:44:11,260
Oh, wow.

5938
03:44:12,500 --> 03:44:13,980
I was like, oh, those are our opponents.

5939
03:44:14,900 --> 03:44:16,400
Yeah, I was like, what?

5940
03:44:16,660 --> 03:44:17,600
Super Goony?

5941
03:44:18,460 --> 03:44:19,560
I got scared.

5942
03:44:19,780 --> 03:44:21,240
I was getting ready to fight that guy.

5943
03:44:23,060 --> 03:44:24,020
There's no fighting Super Gooner.

5944
03:44:24,020 --> 03:44:24,720
No!

5945
03:44:27,300 --> 03:44:28,240
Yeah, it's already too late.

5946
03:44:28,320 --> 03:44:29,160
We've already lost.

5947
03:44:29,820 --> 03:44:30,940
He has nothing to lose.

5948
03:44:34,560 --> 03:44:35,480
Has every team...

5949
03:44:35,480 --> 03:44:37,020
One team's finished.

5950
03:44:39,660 --> 03:44:42,420
One team's done with their games.

5951
03:44:45,100 --> 03:44:46,040
So we stomped hard.

5952
03:44:46,640 --> 03:44:48,660
Yeah, but we gotta stomp the next one.

5953
03:44:48,880 --> 03:44:54,600
If we have only one tie, then we're Winner's Bracket.

5954
03:44:55,820 --> 03:44:57,440
Omni has two ties.

5955
03:44:59,860 --> 03:45:00,980
We don't know if they have two ties.

5956
03:45:01,080 --> 03:45:04,840
I think Omni and Mission are over time right now.

5957
03:45:05,000 --> 03:45:06,560
They haven't posted their results yet.

5958
03:45:16,870 --> 03:45:18,690
I have no idea.

5959
03:45:30,390 --> 03:45:32,250
Yeah, Winner's Bracket is day two.

5960
03:45:32,750 --> 03:45:35,430
If we get Loser Bracket, we have to keep going.

5961
03:45:35,570 --> 03:45:37,770
If we get Winner's Bracket, we're set.

5962
03:45:38,390 --> 03:45:39,450
We're set for tomorrow.

5963
03:45:40,010 --> 03:45:46,450
And then tomorrow, we fight Group G, where their team has not lost a single game yet.

5964
03:45:46,550 --> 03:45:50,790
So, it is a little scary that their team hasn't lost a single game for Group G.

5965
03:45:51,310 --> 03:45:55,890
But Gomez and I are going to research, look at VODs and see what they play.

5966
03:46:04,250 --> 03:46:12,390
Because I knew, before we fought Omni, I told my team, I was like, this is a team that might take a point off of us.

5967
03:46:13,650 --> 03:46:14,890
They could be the hardest.

5968
03:46:15,070 --> 03:46:17,990
Their rank average was the highest out of everybody.

5969
03:46:18,990 --> 03:46:21,390
Because I looked through the day before the tournament.

5970
03:46:23,170 --> 03:46:32,050
I took notes of all the teams in our group, and I knew that team had the highest rank average, so it would pose the biggest threat for us.

5971
03:46:36,450 --> 03:46:38,230
No, their rank average was Celestial.

5972
03:46:38,550 --> 03:46:41,530
They had a Celestial high GM rank average.

5973
03:46:42,010 --> 03:46:48,310
And for us, obviously, ours is like, there's me and Gomez at one above all, but our players aren't Celestials.

5974
03:46:48,950 --> 03:46:49,850
Our players are GM.

5975
03:46:50,970 --> 03:46:54,090
So, as a team, and I think their team screamed a lot too.

5976
03:46:56,170 --> 03:46:57,270
No, you don't.

5977
03:46:58,430 --> 03:46:59,590
No, they'll...

5978
03:46:59,590 --> 03:47:00,190
No, you don't!

5979
03:47:00,270 --> 03:47:02,930
What if they're gonna put fucking weird-ass...

5980
03:47:04,750 --> 03:47:06,030
No, you don't.

5981
03:47:06,370 --> 03:47:08,590
You are not risking our streams.

5982
03:47:10,190 --> 03:47:10,710
Fuck.

5983
03:47:11,650 --> 03:47:12,130
Fuck.

5984
03:47:13,090 --> 03:47:14,410
I won't do it.

5985
03:47:14,670 --> 03:47:16,610
Yeah, we might have a funny...

5986
03:47:16,610 --> 03:47:21,890
We might have had Super Gooner, but we don't know what's next after that.

5987
03:47:22,430 --> 03:47:24,670
I feel like Super Gooner is pretty tame compared to what could be.

5988
03:47:24,710 --> 03:47:26,650
Yeah, what could be?

5989
03:47:28,370 --> 03:47:28,850
Like...

5990
03:47:29,550 --> 03:47:32,370
It's basically like, hey, do you want our streams to get privated?

5991
03:47:33,130 --> 03:47:34,090
Especially Betel.

5992
03:47:35,530 --> 03:47:36,490
Oh, yeah.

5993
03:47:37,190 --> 03:47:38,430
Betel might get...

5994
03:47:38,430 --> 03:47:40,870
Betel's the one that definitely will get privated.

5995
03:47:42,130 --> 03:47:46,150
Okay, we'll keep it safe then.

5996
03:47:46,210 --> 03:47:46,810
We'll keep it safe.

5997
03:47:50,870 --> 03:47:51,350
Alright.

5998
03:47:53,730 --> 03:47:56,690
I'm like looking at it, but nobody's posted screenshots.

5999
03:47:56,970 --> 03:47:57,990
Jesus Christ.

6000
03:47:59,330 --> 03:48:01,610
These streams are like long.

6001
03:48:05,670 --> 03:48:07,010
I'm gonna get water, guys.

6002
03:48:07,490 --> 03:48:08,530
I'll be right back.

6003
03:48:58,810 --> 03:49:00,850
Alright, I'm back.

6004
03:49:01,410 --> 03:49:02,290
I'm back.

6005
03:49:02,370 --> 03:49:03,990
Oh, someone's asking what One Above All is.

6006
03:49:04,090 --> 03:49:05,590
Yeah, One Above All is Top 500.

6007
03:49:07,210 --> 03:49:10,150
I'm currently Top 500, but I don't play a lot on my main, though.

6008
03:49:10,250 --> 03:49:11,790
I think I only have...

6009
03:49:12,970 --> 03:49:13,850
I have...

6010
03:49:13,850 --> 03:49:15,630
I have...

6011
03:49:15,630 --> 03:49:22,430
I played 187 games in Season 1.0, but that's not a lot in Top 500.

6012
03:49:23,070 --> 03:49:23,930
That's actually...

6013
03:49:24,870 --> 03:49:27,470
That's actually not a lot compared to other people.

6014
03:49:27,730 --> 03:49:31,450
So like, I mean, you can see they have 415 wins and all that shit.

6015
03:49:32,010 --> 03:49:36,690
I have like 114 wins, so like I don't really have a lot of...

6016
03:49:36,690 --> 03:49:38,250
Oh, that's Iremix.

6017
03:49:38,690 --> 03:49:39,690
That's an alt account.

6018
03:49:42,970 --> 03:49:43,250
But...

6019
03:49:43,890 --> 03:49:47,110
I don't think I got as a lot of games as...

6020
03:49:47,590 --> 03:49:48,770
I don't like these people.

6021
03:49:48,930 --> 03:49:54,750
Usually people have more games played here.

6022
03:50:00,030 --> 03:50:00,750
But yeah.

6023
03:50:02,390 --> 03:50:04,750
But like, this season I have not played a lot.

6024
03:50:05,230 --> 03:50:07,510
This season, I've literally just played one game.

6025
03:50:12,750 --> 03:50:14,950
I have played one game.

6026
03:50:18,190 --> 03:50:18,530
Yeah.

6027
03:50:19,950 --> 03:50:24,370
No, the first season, this one, this was hell, because I had to climb all the way from the bottom.

6028
03:50:24,810 --> 03:50:26,490
But like, you know, like...

6029
03:50:27,390 --> 03:50:28,350
There's no...

6030
03:50:28,350 --> 03:50:29,490
There's not actual rank...

6031
03:50:29,490 --> 03:50:32,250
I had to go from bronze to...

6032
03:50:32,250 --> 03:50:34,830
And then like, every ELO are all good players.

6033
03:50:34,990 --> 03:50:38,590
Like, when you first started out, every ELO was very...

6034
03:50:38,590 --> 03:50:41,130
Like, you know, Plat was considered top 500.

6035
03:50:41,590 --> 03:50:43,370
Diamond was considered top 500.

6036
03:50:44,890 --> 03:50:46,110
That shit was so difficult.

6037
03:50:48,270 --> 03:50:51,170
When he fell off, I fucking won my one game.

6038
03:50:51,250 --> 03:50:53,410
I technically have 100% win rate.

6039
03:50:56,890 --> 03:50:59,470
I technically have 100% win rate.

6040
03:50:59,550 --> 03:51:00,930
What the fuck do you mean?

6041
03:51:06,050 --> 03:51:08,570
But yeah, I haven't played on main.

6042
03:51:09,010 --> 03:51:11,250
I've just been playing on my ulti counts.

6043
03:51:11,570 --> 03:51:12,510
Just cause like...

6044
03:51:13,930 --> 03:51:18,390
Because of this tournament, cause I like looking at one above all when I'm playing.

6045
03:51:18,470 --> 03:51:19,930
Cause that's just my ego.

6046
03:51:20,690 --> 03:51:22,150
It's... Okay, I'll say.

6047
03:51:22,250 --> 03:51:24,190
It's because of my ego, guys.

6048
03:51:24,190 --> 03:51:29,870
I like to see myself have the one above all under my name in the custom lobby.

6049
03:51:30,110 --> 03:51:40,910
So I haven't... I haven't played... I haven't played any ranked games on my main, cause I wanted to keep... I wanted to keep it for the tournament.

6050
03:51:41,390 --> 03:51:41,850
I...

6051
03:51:45,790 --> 03:51:48,530
I wanted to flex it, okay?

6052
03:51:48,790 --> 03:51:50,950
I just wanted to flex it.

6053
03:51:54,190 --> 03:51:55,470
I'm so real for that.

6054
03:51:55,750 --> 03:51:57,190
I mean, I got targeted, Ben.

6055
03:51:57,330 --> 03:52:00,130
They literally banned...

6056
03:52:00,130 --> 03:52:03,410
It's like me and Gomez are getting banned, cause they're banning my Luna.

6057
03:52:03,750 --> 03:52:06,190
But the thing is, I can adapt.

6058
03:52:06,430 --> 03:52:07,810
I can adapt to other supports.

6059
03:52:07,970 --> 03:52:11,470
And we like practice for when our Luna gets banned.

6060
03:52:15,750 --> 03:52:16,710
But yeah.

6061
03:52:17,510 --> 03:52:19,250
What am I acting on?

6062
03:52:19,250 --> 03:52:20,190
What happened?

6063
03:52:21,430 --> 03:52:25,130
I think one team... One team has overtime or some shit.

6064
03:52:25,450 --> 03:52:25,850
Oh.

6065
03:52:26,390 --> 03:52:30,830
Cause I'm looking at the brackets and... and Group B has already started their fourth round.

6066
03:52:31,450 --> 03:52:31,850
Yeah.

6067
03:52:32,990 --> 03:52:33,390
Like...

6068
03:52:33,390 --> 03:52:35,450
Oh, every other group has started their fourth round.

6069
03:52:35,550 --> 03:52:35,770
Yeah.

6070
03:52:35,970 --> 03:52:37,130
No, they're doing...

6071
03:52:37,130 --> 03:52:40,990
Wait, how could they be... Oh, I guess like the first... Wait, how could they be overtime?

6072
03:52:41,070 --> 03:52:41,870
It's domination!

6073
03:52:43,650 --> 03:52:44,050
Wait!

6074
03:52:44,390 --> 03:52:45,990
Wait a fucking minute!

6075
03:52:47,110 --> 03:52:48,470
Yeah, so I'm like...

6076
03:52:48,470 --> 03:52:49,170
So I'm like confused.

6077
03:52:49,370 --> 03:52:50,910
Have we just been sitting here for no reason?

6078
03:52:51,170 --> 03:52:52,090
No, they haven't...

6079
03:52:52,090 --> 03:52:57,850
No, the... the Omni team has not yet... The Omni team hasn't finished their matches yet.

6080
03:52:58,150 --> 03:53:00,230
That's the only team that hasn't posted screenshots.

6081
03:53:02,010 --> 03:53:03,790
I'm literally looking at it.

6082
03:53:04,730 --> 03:53:05,430
What if they forgot?

6083
03:53:07,150 --> 03:53:08,190
I mean...

6084
03:53:08,190 --> 03:53:09,130
Then they're stupid.

6085
03:53:09,270 --> 03:53:10,050
I don't fucking know.

6086
03:53:10,050 --> 03:53:11,330
Wait, wait,

6087
03:53:18,550 --> 03:53:18,550
wait.

6088
03:53:18,810 --> 03:53:22,390
No, I got target banned in one above all lobbies.

6089
03:53:23,110 --> 03:53:24,490
These people would be like...

6090
03:53:24,490 --> 03:53:25,890
They have... I had...

6091
03:53:25,890 --> 03:53:27,950
I had someone... I won't say who.

6092
03:53:28,290 --> 03:53:30,730
But I had like one or two people on their streams.

6093
03:53:30,890 --> 03:53:34,630
When I played against them, they were like, they have a Luna one trick.

6094
03:53:34,810 --> 03:53:35,530
Bad Luna.

6095
03:53:37,530 --> 03:53:39,690
I was like, what do you mean?

6096
03:53:40,190 --> 03:53:41,950
I play other supports?

6097
03:53:41,950 --> 03:53:43,610
What the fuck?

6098
03:53:43,730 --> 03:53:44,630
And then Luna got banned.

6099
03:53:49,550 --> 03:53:51,670
I was like, what do you mean?

6100
03:53:52,450 --> 03:53:53,830
I still won the game.

6101
03:53:53,990 --> 03:53:57,030
I mean, I lost one of the target banned, but I won the other target banned.

6102
03:54:00,930 --> 03:54:03,390
I won the other target...

6103
03:54:03,390 --> 03:54:04,390
It's 1-1.

6104
03:54:04,490 --> 03:54:07,030
My record is 1-1 when I got target banned.

6105
03:54:11,950 --> 03:54:13,310
They were talking about me.

6106
03:54:13,450 --> 03:54:15,210
They named me specifically.

6107
03:54:15,410 --> 03:54:16,410
I was like, no!

6108
03:54:17,610 --> 03:54:18,970
That's not true!

6109
03:54:19,610 --> 03:54:20,130
Stop!

6110
03:54:20,990 --> 03:54:22,270
That's not true.

6111
03:54:25,490 --> 03:54:27,030
They won their...

6112
03:54:27,030 --> 03:54:28,490
They won their game.

6113
03:54:31,550 --> 03:54:33,090
Omni won, so they're tied.

6114
03:54:33,170 --> 03:54:35,010
They have two ties, so we can't tie the next one.

6115
03:54:36,250 --> 03:54:37,050
Oh, okay.

6116
03:54:37,150 --> 03:54:37,670
We'll be fine.

6117
03:54:39,630 --> 03:54:41,390
They have two ties right now.

6118
03:54:46,230 --> 03:54:47,990
I think that was the team we're waiting on.

6119
03:54:48,090 --> 03:54:49,490
I'm pretty sure every other team is done.

6120
03:54:52,090 --> 03:54:52,910
I don't understand.

6121
03:54:53,370 --> 03:54:55,210
How did they go overtime?

6122
03:54:55,330 --> 03:54:56,170
It's domination.

6123
03:54:57,950 --> 03:54:58,970
That one I don't know.

6124
03:54:59,190 --> 03:55:00,050
That's weird.

6125
03:55:00,890 --> 03:55:03,670
They probably went like 99-99 through all three maps.

6126
03:55:04,470 --> 03:55:06,630
Maybe the 99 was like 20 years long.

6127
03:55:08,770 --> 03:55:09,910
Or some shit.

6128
03:55:10,430 --> 03:55:11,830
Some intense game.

6129
03:55:12,230 --> 03:55:12,550
Yeah.

6130
03:55:16,400 --> 03:55:16,880
Alright.

6131
03:55:18,080 --> 03:55:19,700
Aren't we just waiting for us?

6132
03:55:20,700 --> 03:55:21,700
Oh my god.

6133
03:55:22,040 --> 03:55:23,800
No, okay, group B is still waiting.

6134
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:25,820
No, only group C is playing.

6135
03:55:26,520 --> 03:55:27,420
Group C is the only one.

6136
03:55:27,480 --> 03:55:29,900
Oh, group C, F...

6137
03:55:29,900 --> 03:55:32,160
Yeah, group C and F went on to the next one.

6138
03:55:39,250 --> 03:55:39,730
Alright.

6139
03:55:40,530 --> 03:55:42,610
They should give us our challenge soon.

6140
03:55:45,610 --> 03:55:46,170
Yeah.

6141
03:55:46,810 --> 03:55:48,130
On Monday, I'm taking a break.

6142
03:55:48,530 --> 03:55:51,210
I'm doing rest days on...

6143
03:55:52,570 --> 03:55:53,690
Monday and...

6144
03:55:53,690 --> 03:55:54,070
Tuesday.

6145
03:55:54,850 --> 03:55:56,370
Just to fix my voice.

6146
03:55:56,850 --> 03:55:58,190
Because it's not good.

6147
03:55:58,510 --> 03:55:59,590
It is not okay.

6148
03:56:04,750 --> 03:56:07,350
But yeah, Monday and Tuesday I'm definitely taking a rest day.

6149
03:56:07,730 --> 03:56:11,250
And then we have another Marble Rivals tournament on...

6150
03:56:11,250 --> 03:56:11,990
What's it?

6151
03:56:12,090 --> 03:56:12,650
13th?

6152
03:56:12,650 --> 03:56:13,290
Is that Saturday?

6153
03:56:14,530 --> 03:56:15,610
Oh shit, it's Thursday.

6154
03:56:15,830 --> 03:56:16,970
Okay, let me...

6155
03:56:17,690 --> 03:56:19,250
I have another Marble Rivals...

6156
03:56:19,250 --> 03:56:21,130
I have the Toast Marble Rivals tournament.

6157
03:56:22,150 --> 03:56:23,690
On Thursday, I believe.

6158
03:56:24,710 --> 03:56:24,970
Yeah.

6159
03:56:26,710 --> 03:56:27,270
So...

6160
03:56:27,270 --> 03:56:28,410
Yay, Marble Rivals.

6161
03:56:28,870 --> 03:56:29,030
Yay.

6162
03:56:35,250 --> 03:56:35,810
Yeah,

6163
03:56:38,950 --> 03:56:39,210
I did.

6164
03:56:39,430 --> 03:56:40,590
I posted my results instantly.

6165
03:56:42,130 --> 03:56:43,310
Don't worry, guys.

6166
03:56:43,530 --> 03:56:44,710
I did my job.

6167
03:56:45,130 --> 03:56:45,430
Did I?

6168
03:56:46,050 --> 03:56:47,030
Don't worry, guys.

6169
03:56:47,190 --> 03:56:48,630
I definitely did my job.

6170
03:56:53,110 --> 03:56:54,670
Okay, who are we playing?

6171
03:56:54,830 --> 03:56:55,450
Come on.

6172
03:56:55,630 --> 03:56:56,670
Update our challenge.

6173
03:56:57,950 --> 03:56:58,830
Come on.

6174
03:57:02,090 --> 03:57:03,970
Oh, this will be our last two games.

6175
03:57:04,150 --> 03:57:04,990
If we win.

6176
03:57:05,150 --> 03:57:06,290
If we are winners bracket.

6177
03:57:07,390 --> 03:57:08,470
Finals is definitely scary.

6178
03:57:08,610 --> 03:57:10,430
I don't know how many matches we're playing in finals.

6179
03:57:11,330 --> 03:57:12,150
I don't remember.

6180
03:57:12,590 --> 03:57:14,630
Okay, it doesn't say how many...

6181
03:57:14,630 --> 03:57:16,070
I need to read rules.

6182
03:57:19,370 --> 03:57:22,370
I need to read so many rules.

6183
03:57:22,570 --> 03:57:23,770
Wait, not every...

6184
03:57:23,770 --> 03:57:24,690
Wait, what the fuck?

6185
03:57:26,150 --> 03:57:26,970
Let's see.

6186
03:57:27,270 --> 03:57:28,150
There's no way.

6187
03:57:29,270 --> 03:57:32,150
There's no way that we have to wait for...

6188
03:57:32,150 --> 03:57:33,290
Do we have to wait for them too?

6189
03:57:34,510 --> 03:57:36,830
There's like two teams that haven't finished yet.

6190
03:57:37,050 --> 03:57:37,430
I think.

6191
03:57:37,430 --> 03:57:37,850
Wait, no.

6192
03:57:39,030 --> 03:57:40,190
No, this team finished.

6193
03:57:41,370 --> 03:57:42,570
How about this other team?

6194
03:57:44,110 --> 03:57:46,610
Shit, don't tell me that team hasn't...

6195
03:57:46,610 --> 03:57:47,210
I'm looking.

6196
03:57:49,410 --> 03:57:51,170
This was an hour ago.

6197
03:57:53,370 --> 03:57:54,050
Oh, okay.

6198
03:57:54,170 --> 03:57:54,570
Both teams...

6199
03:57:54,570 --> 03:57:55,470
Okay, everybody's done.

6200
03:57:55,710 --> 03:57:57,270
So our thing should be done soon.

6201
03:57:57,850 --> 03:57:59,330
Wait, why didn't they update us?

6202
03:58:01,570 --> 03:58:02,670
Where's our update?

6203
03:58:03,290 --> 03:58:05,710
We finished too fast that they forgot about us?

6204
03:58:05,710 --> 03:58:06,670
Hahaha.

6205
03:58:07,750 --> 03:58:08,250
Hahaha.

6206
03:58:09,150 --> 03:58:11,290
Our challenge hasn't updated yet.

6207
03:58:11,970 --> 03:58:13,590
They haven't updated our challenge.

6208
03:58:16,970 --> 03:58:19,870
Maybe I'll be like...

6209
03:58:19,870 --> 03:58:21,560
I'll message and be like...

6210
03:58:24,270 --> 03:58:25,050
Hey...

6211
03:58:25,050 --> 03:58:25,790
Wait,

6212
03:58:29,860 --> 03:58:31,260
I'm checking if they updated.

6213
03:58:31,500 --> 03:58:32,280
They don't have it.

6214
03:58:33,440 --> 03:58:35,040
We noticed our challenge...

6215
03:58:35,450 --> 03:58:38,120
hasn't been updated yet.

6216
03:58:42,560 --> 03:58:43,100
Challenge...

6217
03:58:43,100 --> 03:58:46,100
Yeah, we were the first team to finish both sets.

6218
03:58:49,170 --> 03:58:50,250
One team...

6219
03:58:50,970 --> 03:58:53,050
First place team in their group...

6220
03:58:53,050 --> 03:58:54,030
goes to winners bracket.

6221
03:58:54,190 --> 03:58:55,630
Second place goes to losers bracket.

6222
03:58:56,770 --> 03:58:58,410
I don't want to play losers bracket.

6223
03:58:58,650 --> 03:58:59,850
I don't want to play.

6224
03:59:00,130 --> 03:59:02,970
When we play losers bracket, we have to play...

6225
03:59:04,950 --> 03:59:05,220
like...

6226
03:59:05,670 --> 03:59:07,990
God, how many games do we have to play?

6227
03:59:07,990 --> 03:59:08,830
Like...

6228
03:59:08,830 --> 03:59:11,350
We have to play...

6229
03:59:11,990 --> 03:59:14,310
1, 2, 3, 4.

6230
03:59:14,470 --> 03:59:16,010
We have to play 4 more matches.

6231
03:59:17,050 --> 03:59:19,250
We have to play 4 different teams.

6232
03:59:19,450 --> 03:59:21,570
That's 8 more games.

6233
03:59:21,710 --> 03:59:23,850
I do not want to play 8 more games, guys.

6234
03:59:27,890 --> 03:59:30,170
I'm not strong enough for that.

6235
03:59:33,530 --> 03:59:35,070
We have to stomp.

6236
03:59:35,070 --> 03:59:37,130
We have to hard stomp the next round.

6237
03:59:37,670 --> 03:59:38,630
To make sure...

6238
03:59:38,630 --> 03:59:41,030
we don't have to go through that.

6239
03:59:45,110 --> 03:59:46,310
Competitive Rivals...

6240
03:59:46,310 --> 03:59:47,930
takes so much out of you.

6241
03:59:49,250 --> 03:59:50,210
Because it's a lot.

6242
03:59:50,670 --> 03:59:52,370
Because I'm like...

6243
03:59:52,370 --> 03:59:53,290
co-IGL.

6244
03:59:54,890 --> 03:59:57,070
I'm also the ult tracker...

6245
03:59:57,070 --> 03:59:57,850
for our team.

6246
04:00:00,250 --> 04:00:02,130
It takes so much.

6247
04:00:02,450 --> 04:00:03,910
I have to think a lot.

6248
04:00:03,910 --> 04:00:05,970
And shit like that.

6249
04:00:06,010 --> 04:00:06,530
So I'm like...

6250
04:00:07,590 --> 04:00:08,790
I'm like...

6251
04:00:09,690 --> 04:00:10,590
I'm tired.

6252
04:00:11,930 --> 04:00:14,130
Because I don't have to do that in regular rank.

6253
04:00:14,210 --> 04:00:15,350
Because I don't fucking care.

6254
04:00:16,730 --> 04:00:19,910
I don't care as much...

6255
04:00:21,630 --> 04:00:23,910
in regular rank to ult track.

6256
04:00:24,330 --> 04:00:25,830
I mean, I ult track to myself.

6257
04:00:26,150 --> 04:00:27,630
But I don't talk to people.

6258
04:00:28,970 --> 04:00:31,470
I don't care enough.

6259
04:00:31,470 --> 04:00:32,890
But obviously here...

6260
04:00:32,890 --> 04:00:34,430
I have to actually talk.

6261
04:00:38,930 --> 04:00:41,010
I'm going to tell you guys what's going on.

6262
04:00:41,050 --> 04:00:42,250
So you guys can learn from me.

6263
04:00:43,150 --> 04:00:43,930
Wait, what?

6264
04:00:46,010 --> 04:00:47,090
Oh, because I was like...

6265
04:00:47,090 --> 04:00:47,950
How are we 4th place?

6266
04:00:47,970 --> 04:00:49,270
But they didn't put our scores in yet.

6267
04:00:49,310 --> 04:00:50,410
I was like, what the fuck?

6268
04:00:51,530 --> 04:00:53,250
I was like, wait a minute.

6269
04:00:53,630 --> 04:00:54,850
How are we 4th place?

6270
04:00:54,950 --> 04:00:56,010
We lost...

6271
04:00:56,770 --> 04:00:59,650
Our score hasn't been put yet.

6272
04:01:00,310 --> 04:01:01,430
They haven't put our scores in.

6273
04:01:03,870 --> 04:01:05,830
Yeah, I'm not here to think, guys.

6274
04:01:09,470 --> 04:01:10,870
I'm not here to think.

6275
04:01:11,170 --> 04:01:13,030
I'm here to just survive.

6276
04:01:14,870 --> 04:01:15,430
Wait!

6277
04:01:16,990 --> 04:01:17,550
Wait!

6278
04:01:17,810 --> 04:01:18,110
Gomez!

6279
04:01:20,430 --> 04:01:20,990
The...

6280
04:01:21,650 --> 04:01:22,090
The...

6281
04:01:22,090 --> 04:01:25,150
That team that we thought was really hard...

6282
04:01:25,150 --> 04:01:27,490
Is 3rd place right now.

6283
04:01:27,630 --> 04:01:28,250
In their group.

6284
04:01:30,450 --> 04:01:31,010
Gomez?

6285
04:01:32,450 --> 04:01:33,050
Oh, okay.

6286
04:01:33,050 --> 04:01:34,890
I guess everybody left.

6287
04:01:36,910 --> 04:01:38,910
I'll talk to you guys.

6288
04:01:38,990 --> 04:01:40,010
Fuck that guy.

6289
04:01:42,410 --> 04:01:44,750
I thought you guys would respond to that.

6290
04:01:44,870 --> 04:01:45,990
3rd place?

6291
04:01:46,470 --> 04:01:49,070
I'm looking at it.

6292
04:01:49,150 --> 04:01:52,370
And that team that we struggled with the most...

6293
04:01:52,370 --> 04:01:53,550
They tied 2 sets.

6294
04:01:53,750 --> 04:01:54,570
They tied 2 sets.

6295
04:01:56,910 --> 04:02:00,550
The team that we thought was the hardest...

6296
04:02:00,550 --> 04:02:01,890
In the tournament, they tied 2 sets.

6297
04:02:01,890 --> 04:02:03,670
So 2 teams...

6298
04:02:03,670 --> 04:02:05,330
Got a tie off of them.

6299
04:02:06,330 --> 04:02:06,630
Wait, really?

6300
04:02:07,610 --> 04:02:08,770
So they might be...

6301
04:02:11,310 --> 04:02:12,110
I'm not worried.

6302
04:02:12,210 --> 04:02:15,750
We did kind of overestimate them.

6303
04:02:15,830 --> 04:02:17,830
Because as soon as we won the 3-3 comp, they just didn't know.

6304
04:02:17,850 --> 04:02:19,510
Yeah, but it's also more so...

6305
04:02:19,510 --> 04:02:21,590
The comp-wise...

6306
04:02:21,590 --> 04:02:26,290
Because we know what comp goes good against them.

6307
04:02:26,590 --> 04:02:27,950
But if they don't make it to the finals...

6308
04:02:28,550 --> 04:02:30,070
We have to figure out...

6309
04:02:30,070 --> 04:02:33,370
We might actually play against Mace's team then.

6310
04:02:34,550 --> 04:02:34,990
Yeah.

6311
04:02:36,270 --> 04:02:36,950
Now something.

6312
04:02:39,750 --> 04:02:42,510
I thought it would be them or Mace.

6313
04:02:42,710 --> 04:02:43,810
But like...

6314
04:02:43,810 --> 04:02:44,370
I don't know.

6315
04:02:47,390 --> 04:02:50,390
I'm looking at the 2 teams that got ties off of them.

6316
04:02:51,250 --> 04:02:52,190
And I'm surprised.

6317
04:02:53,230 --> 04:02:53,670
Oh boy.

6318
04:02:54,690 --> 04:02:56,630
So then it might be a lot harder than we thought.

6319
04:02:56,630 --> 04:02:57,330
Ooh.

6320
04:02:58,750 --> 04:03:02,910
Well, do we know if we're going to go against one of the better teams that beat the team that we thought?

6321
04:03:03,170 --> 04:03:03,970
Are we going to go against them?

6322
04:03:04,090 --> 04:03:06,910
No, they're going to fight Mace's team.

6323
04:03:07,230 --> 04:03:07,510
Oh, okay.

6324
04:03:08,310 --> 04:03:10,610
We're playing the team that got...

6325
04:03:10,610 --> 04:03:13,430
We're playing the team that got a point off...

6326
04:03:13,430 --> 04:03:14,850
A tie off of...

6327
04:03:16,690 --> 04:03:17,050
Oni.

6328
04:03:17,870 --> 04:03:18,230
Okay.

6329
04:03:18,610 --> 04:03:21,890
Oh, it's casted by the way.

6330
04:03:21,990 --> 04:03:22,750
It's going to be casted.

6331
04:03:22,750 --> 04:03:23,230
It's casted?

6332
04:03:24,830 --> 04:03:26,850
I'll give you the group ID.

6333
04:03:33,630 --> 04:03:34,870
Alright, that's the leader.

6334
04:03:35,330 --> 04:03:36,110
That's the captain.

6335
04:03:37,550 --> 04:03:39,970
Alright, let me see if they hide their shit.

6336
04:03:42,070 --> 04:03:43,210
Let me see.

6337
04:03:43,910 --> 04:03:45,990
Wait, why are we playing Winner's POV?

6338
04:03:47,610 --> 04:03:48,190
Okay.

6339
04:03:48,610 --> 04:03:50,070
They do Bucky by the way.

6340
04:03:50,670 --> 04:03:52,510
Why are we doing Winner's POV?

6341
04:03:53,710 --> 04:03:55,190
We can't be playing them.

6342
04:03:55,650 --> 04:03:56,410
No, we're not.

6343
04:03:56,550 --> 04:03:57,290
We're playing a different team.

6344
04:03:57,550 --> 04:03:59,870
I was going to say, Winner's POV is like 08.

6345
04:03:59,870 --> 04:04:00,370
No, no.

6346
04:04:01,030 --> 04:04:03,090
We're playing against...

6347
04:04:03,090 --> 04:04:03,990
The Minnow.

6348
04:04:04,590 --> 04:04:06,510
Would I give them the right code?

6349
04:04:07,990 --> 04:04:08,730
Okay, I'm back again.

6350
04:04:09,610 --> 04:04:10,410
Wait, what?

6351
04:04:10,650 --> 04:04:12,770
That's not the team...

6352
04:04:12,770 --> 04:04:15,190
We are playing against...

6353
04:04:15,870 --> 04:04:17,190
We are playing against...

6354
04:04:17,910 --> 04:04:18,970
Okay, hello.

6355
04:04:19,410 --> 04:04:20,530
Yeah, they realized it.

6356
04:04:21,970 --> 04:04:23,050
I'm like, we'll do it.

6357
04:04:23,050 --> 04:04:24,330
I'll do it.

6358
04:04:24,410 --> 04:04:25,170
It'll be easier.

6359
04:04:27,070 --> 04:04:29,270
Okay, so they do...

6360
04:04:29,270 --> 04:04:30,910
They sometimes play Hulk too.

6361
04:04:32,950 --> 04:04:39,990
They play Hulk, Strange, Bucky, Namor, and then Loki, Sue.

6362
04:04:41,390 --> 04:04:42,030
Alright.

6363
04:04:42,770 --> 04:04:45,470
I see a lot of Loki and Sue.

6364
04:04:47,710 --> 04:04:49,630
Wait, that's the team that we have to play?

6365
04:04:49,970 --> 04:04:50,290
Yeah.

6366
04:04:50,290 --> 04:04:51,710
They have...

6367
04:04:53,190 --> 04:04:55,930
Hulk, Strange, Bucky, Namor, Loki, Sue.

6368
04:04:56,090 --> 04:04:59,770
And then sometimes they put in Hela over Bucky sometimes.

6369
04:05:01,130 --> 04:05:02,290
So we ban...

6370
04:05:04,030 --> 04:05:07,030
Do you want to kill Bucky or save for Gomez?

6371
04:05:07,410 --> 04:05:09,830
Bucky is kind of just Thanos of a character.

6372
04:05:10,130 --> 04:05:11,610
I don't want that running around.

6373
04:05:12,110 --> 04:05:16,130
Oh yeah, they could use Bucky against our Loki clones.

6374
04:05:16,210 --> 04:05:17,250
Yeah, the Loki clone.

6375
04:05:17,250 --> 04:05:19,410
Let's just ban Bucky then.

6376
04:05:19,910 --> 04:05:22,690
Namor is not really good into double shield.

6377
04:05:23,650 --> 04:05:25,090
So we can leave that open.

6378
04:05:25,410 --> 04:05:26,970
Did you invite the people, Gomez?

6379
04:05:27,230 --> 04:05:27,570
I did.

6380
04:05:27,930 --> 04:05:30,170
Please join the cast.

6381
04:05:30,830 --> 04:05:32,030
They hate me.

6382
04:05:33,290 --> 04:05:34,470
It says join the cast.

6383
04:05:34,530 --> 04:05:35,690
Are we joining their room then?

6384
04:05:36,030 --> 04:05:36,490
Oh, I guess.

6385
04:05:36,850 --> 04:05:37,990
Oh, please join the...

6386
04:05:37,990 --> 04:05:39,770
Oh, okay.

6387
04:05:40,730 --> 04:05:41,610
We join their room.

6388
04:05:42,970 --> 04:05:43,810
Request to join.

6389
04:05:44,010 --> 04:05:46,350
Oh, they're you.

6390
04:05:47,630 --> 04:05:48,230
Oh, okay.

6391
04:05:49,710 --> 04:05:50,910
Can I join from one of you?

6392
04:05:50,950 --> 04:05:51,390
What am I doing?

6393
04:05:51,490 --> 04:05:51,810
I'm dumb.

6394
04:05:52,470 --> 04:05:53,430
We'll invite you in.

6395
04:05:54,290 --> 04:05:54,830
Oh, okay.

6396
04:05:57,110 --> 04:05:58,150
Who is missing?

6397
04:05:59,330 --> 04:06:01,630
Is Jay in or is it going to be Betel?

6398
04:06:03,130 --> 04:06:06,190
Should we put Betel first just to see how it goes?

6399
04:06:08,170 --> 04:06:09,150
Sure, let's do that.

6400
04:06:10,870 --> 04:06:11,550
Betel's in.

6401
04:06:11,550 --> 04:06:12,130
Who am I missing?

6402
04:06:12,470 --> 04:06:14,090
I'm missing Shoto.

6403
04:06:14,450 --> 04:06:15,850
Can't join.

6404
04:06:16,250 --> 04:06:18,650
I got him first.

6405
04:06:22,510 --> 04:06:23,610
I'm ready.

6406
04:06:28,920 --> 04:06:31,080
Which one's their spooker?

6407
04:06:31,660 --> 04:06:32,480
Like spooky dude.

6408
04:06:37,590 --> 04:06:38,360
Let's see.

6409
04:06:39,320 --> 04:06:41,500
Their best player plays Sue.

6410
04:06:42,840 --> 04:06:44,340
I mean, if we're just talking by rank.

6411
04:06:44,340 --> 04:06:45,880
Yeah, if it's rank wise.

6412
04:06:46,020 --> 04:06:47,220
I mean, let me look at this.

6413
04:06:47,580 --> 04:06:47,860
Okay.

6414
04:06:50,200 --> 04:06:51,840
Oh wait, Ness is in here.

6415
04:06:52,120 --> 04:06:53,480
It's Ness by the way, the Apex player.

6416
04:06:53,580 --> 04:06:55,660
Everybody's blocked except the Celestial player.

6417
04:06:55,680 --> 04:06:56,140
Who's the Ness?

6418
04:07:00,860 --> 04:07:01,260
Whoever's...

6419
04:07:01,260 --> 04:07:02,860
Okay, wait, let me see who their DPS is.

6420
04:07:04,400 --> 04:07:04,940
Let me look up.

6421
04:07:05,600 --> 04:07:11,440
Ness, by the way, I don't know which one's their account, but they're Apex Predator player.

6422
04:07:14,340 --> 04:07:19,280
I recognize Ness because I've seen him in Apex Creator Journeys.

6423
04:07:20,160 --> 04:07:21,500
I believe...

6424
04:07:21,500 --> 04:07:22,960
It's one of their DPS players.

6425
04:07:23,300 --> 04:07:25,140
It's either...

6426
04:07:26,860 --> 04:07:30,340
It's one of their DPS players that's the...

6427
04:07:33,020 --> 04:07:34,100
Apex player.

6428
04:07:36,060 --> 04:07:37,780
Okay, they play Storm.

6429
04:07:38,660 --> 04:07:40,280
I see Storm gameplay.

6430
04:07:40,280 --> 04:07:40,460
Okay.

6431
04:07:42,320 --> 04:07:43,000
Hella.

6432
04:07:46,760 --> 04:07:49,680
Jura is their other high ranker, so it's their strange player.

6433
04:07:52,820 --> 04:07:54,180
Jura and...

6434
04:07:54,180 --> 04:07:55,460
is their other high ranker.

6435
04:07:56,020 --> 04:07:58,780
Their highest ranker for previous seasons.

6436
04:08:00,480 --> 04:08:01,940
And he's their strange lord.

6437
04:08:03,160 --> 04:08:03,840
GM.

6438
04:08:04,940 --> 04:08:06,240
The other ones are like...

6439
04:08:06,240 --> 04:08:10,820
The other ones are like Silver, Diamond, Bronze, GM, Bronze, GM.

6440
04:08:16,160 --> 04:08:17,340
Should be too bad.

6441
04:08:19,960 --> 04:08:21,340
Wait, did we say we're ready?

6442
04:08:22,620 --> 04:08:23,140
Uh...

6443
04:08:23,140 --> 04:08:24,780
Alright, whatever.

6444
04:08:25,140 --> 04:08:26,060
It wasn't enough for my cat.

6445
04:08:27,700 --> 04:08:28,500
We back.

6446
04:08:29,200 --> 04:08:30,440
Oh wait, nevermind.

6447
04:08:31,460 --> 04:08:34,560
I don't want my cat meowing at me the entire time.

6448
04:08:36,600 --> 04:08:37,340
Oh, it's whatever.

6449
04:08:37,500 --> 04:08:38,200
They ready up.

6450
04:08:38,640 --> 04:08:39,580
Wait, actually, nevermind.

6451
04:08:39,580 --> 04:08:41,840
Oh, actually, no, I can come back in time.

6452
04:08:41,960 --> 04:08:42,260
Okay.

6453
04:08:42,820 --> 04:08:44,040
You guys can handle Bans, right?

6454
04:08:44,340 --> 04:08:45,340
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

6455
04:08:45,820 --> 04:08:49,900
Oh, they said let's go.

6456
04:08:50,360 --> 04:08:52,760
Okay, well, I hope we can't.

6457
04:08:55,180 --> 04:08:57,280
I didn't think they'd do it right away.

6458
04:08:57,700 --> 04:08:59,540
I hope we can't.

6459
04:09:01,810 --> 04:09:02,630
Did we stall?

6460
04:09:03,470 --> 04:09:04,130
That's fine.

6461
04:09:04,490 --> 04:09:06,050
We can handle Bans, I believe in us.

6462
04:09:06,530 --> 04:09:07,190
Alright, let's do it.

6463
04:09:07,190 --> 04:09:09,050
Cause we're Banning Bucky first.

6464
04:09:11,330 --> 04:09:13,170
We're Banning Bucky first to protect Mag.

6465
04:09:14,310 --> 04:09:15,290
If they don't Ban Mag.

6466
04:09:15,950 --> 04:09:21,070
If they target Ban Mag, we save Starlord.

6467
04:09:22,350 --> 04:09:22,630
Got it.

6468
04:09:23,490 --> 04:09:24,490
Oh, I like that.

6469
04:09:24,710 --> 04:09:24,810
Good.

6470
04:09:25,510 --> 04:09:30,950
So at least Gomez can just harass him on Starlord for fucking doing that.

6471
04:09:34,530 --> 04:09:38,610
And if they Ban Luna, we can play like, you know, Adam, Loki, Sue.

6472
04:09:43,030 --> 04:09:44,370
Oh, six minutes?

6473
04:09:44,650 --> 04:09:45,130
Okay.

6474
04:09:46,170 --> 04:09:49,630
They're like, six minutes till the game starts, apparently on the casting.

6475
04:09:50,550 --> 04:09:51,230
Oh, why?

6476
04:09:51,590 --> 04:09:52,510
I don't know.

6477
04:09:54,550 --> 04:09:59,030
Just in case we haven't had enough of a break for the last like 15 or 20 minutes.

6478
04:09:59,690 --> 04:10:01,230
I've been iced, man.

6479
04:10:01,370 --> 04:10:02,330
It's been like half an hour.

6480
04:10:03,370 --> 04:10:04,670
I'm so tired.

6481
04:10:05,030 --> 04:10:06,830
I'm losing my motion.

6482
04:10:06,830 --> 04:10:08,450
Yeah, yeah, literally.

6483
04:10:09,290 --> 04:10:10,870
Oh, because they're swapping casts.

6484
04:10:10,990 --> 04:10:12,010
They're setting up the casting.

6485
04:10:12,590 --> 04:10:14,370
I'm fucking using the bathroom.

6486
04:10:14,630 --> 04:10:16,750
I hydrated so much.

6487
04:10:18,070 --> 04:10:19,350
Too much gamer subs.

6488
04:10:20,710 --> 04:10:21,150
Oh boy.

6489
04:10:27,870 --> 04:10:28,090
Okay.

6490
04:10:29,110 --> 04:10:29,690
Let's see.

6491
04:10:39,980 --> 04:10:42,820
Hella Storm Strange Hulk.

6492
04:10:56,850 --> 04:11:02,070
They like dive That's interesting.

6493
04:11:03,290 --> 04:11:04,390
Do they now?

6494
04:11:05,150 --> 04:11:07,710
I saw like a Thor cap.

6495
04:11:07,910 --> 04:11:10,630
Thor cap, Hulk, that kind of stuff.

6496
04:11:16,040 --> 04:11:22,300
Then the last game they played like Hulk Strange and Strange Thor.

6497
04:11:23,720 --> 04:11:25,380
Hulk is not that scary.

6498
04:11:26,780 --> 04:11:26,940
Yeah.

6499
04:11:26,940 --> 04:11:27,700
IMO.

6500
04:11:28,540 --> 04:11:30,220
As long as they freeze him.

6501
04:11:33,480 --> 04:11:39,520
The only thing that seems consistent is like from them is a Storm, consistently a Storm player.

6502
04:11:40,900 --> 04:11:42,660
Oh, they're saying.

6503
04:11:44,780 --> 04:11:45,420
Shibuya.

6504
04:11:46,180 --> 04:11:47,520
Back to Shibuya we go.

6505
04:11:50,440 --> 04:11:51,760
Let's get it.

6506
04:11:51,840 --> 04:11:54,460
Alright, this could be our last two games, guys.

6507
04:11:54,460 --> 04:11:56,160
We got hard stomp.

6508
04:11:56,400 --> 04:11:56,980
Hard stomp.

6509
04:11:57,460 --> 04:11:58,960
There's no bans.

6510
04:12:00,140 --> 04:12:02,220
Oh my god.

6511
04:12:05,620 --> 04:12:08,480
Wait, did production do this?

6512
04:12:09,020 --> 04:12:09,380
Yeah.

6513
04:12:09,540 --> 04:12:10,120
I think so.

6514
04:12:12,200 --> 04:12:14,540
I like how it's only us that realize there's no debt.

6515
04:12:16,740 --> 04:12:18,100
I got excited.

6516
04:12:18,720 --> 04:12:20,060
No bans, let's go!

6517
04:12:20,060 --> 04:12:20,500
Okay, bye.

6518
04:12:22,920 --> 04:12:24,380
We all leave.

6519
04:12:24,800 --> 04:12:26,200
No, can we play it out?

6520
04:12:26,240 --> 04:12:27,040
We can have Starlord.

6521
04:12:29,760 --> 04:12:32,260
We can because they're doing quick play.

6522
04:12:32,380 --> 04:12:34,460
So we don't have the back and forth.

6523
04:12:35,120 --> 04:12:36,840
So we can't play it out.

6524
04:12:37,920 --> 04:12:39,240
Alright, invite me whenever.

6525
04:12:40,340 --> 04:12:42,020
19 and 32.

6526
04:12:42,600 --> 04:12:46,200
Damn, I've only played 32 games of competitive?

6527
04:12:47,840 --> 04:12:49,380
Wait, overall?

6528
04:12:50,420 --> 04:12:51,400
Or like this season?

6529
04:12:51,580 --> 04:12:52,880
No, just this season.

6530
04:12:54,260 --> 04:12:56,080
Holy fuck, what were you doing?

6531
04:12:57,180 --> 04:12:58,420
139 in season 1.

6532
04:12:58,580 --> 04:12:58,820
Okay.

6533
04:13:01,740 --> 04:13:02,360
Oh my god.

6534
04:13:02,520 --> 04:13:06,960
I was telling my chat that I flame people for their win rate, so I hid my stuff so they couldn't find mine.

6535
04:13:08,480 --> 04:13:08,880
That's...

6536
04:13:08,880 --> 04:13:13,400
Wow, you only have a 52% win rate?

6537
04:13:13,520 --> 04:13:14,120
Like yeah, man.

6538
04:13:14,120 --> 04:13:15,800
That's how the fucking game works.

6539
04:13:18,320 --> 04:13:20,680
You're in the loser queue, I see.

6540
04:13:20,800 --> 04:13:22,960
I didn't think loser queue was real until this game.

6541
04:13:23,120 --> 04:13:24,060
That is crazy.

6542
04:13:24,740 --> 04:13:28,020
Seriously, because I came from League and people who said that were bad.

6543
04:13:28,200 --> 04:13:29,120
But in this game, it's real.

6544
04:13:30,260 --> 04:13:31,520
But in this game, it's real.

6545
04:13:31,700 --> 04:13:33,880
Are you sure you're not coping?

6546
04:13:36,920 --> 04:13:41,840
I swear because I got to whatever, Diamond on Fantastic.

6547
04:13:41,840 --> 04:13:43,400
I was like, alright, I want to learn Starlord.

6548
04:13:43,700 --> 04:13:44,900
20% win rate.

6549
04:13:45,000 --> 04:13:46,320
Losing every game, SVP.

6550
04:13:46,460 --> 04:13:47,520
Just can't do anything.

6551
04:13:47,740 --> 04:13:48,320
It was bad.

6552
04:13:48,780 --> 04:13:49,220
It's real.

6553
04:13:53,180 --> 04:13:54,060
That's crazy.

6554
04:13:54,440 --> 04:13:56,040
Wait, did Coney just fucking disappeared?

6555
04:13:57,240 --> 04:13:59,280
Oh wait, you just cut off there.

6556
04:13:59,680 --> 04:14:01,320
You had like a...

6557
04:14:01,800 --> 04:14:02,560
They got me.

6558
04:14:03,800 --> 04:14:04,940
No, they got Coney.

6559
04:14:06,000 --> 04:14:07,420
He's talking about loser queue.

6560
04:14:07,540 --> 04:14:08,500
Get him, he knows too much.

6561
04:14:08,500 --> 04:14:11,880
They cut his internet out.

6562
04:14:15,170 --> 04:14:16,770
Coney, don't leave us.

6563
04:14:19,830 --> 04:14:21,650
I'll just be like R whenever.

6564
04:14:22,190 --> 04:14:22,890
I'll just write that.

6565
04:14:23,910 --> 04:14:26,930
Like how we didn't notice we didn't even notice it was on quick play.

6566
04:14:27,330 --> 04:14:27,870
We're too...

6567
04:14:27,870 --> 04:14:29,690
We just won it over with.

6568
04:14:36,880 --> 04:14:38,500
No pressure here, by the way.

6569
04:14:38,960 --> 04:14:40,860
I have like a 20 win rate on this map.

6570
04:14:41,460 --> 04:14:42,100
Hell yeah.

6571
04:14:42,380 --> 04:14:42,780
What?

6572
04:14:44,140 --> 04:14:45,760
In comp and in scrims.

6573
04:14:47,400 --> 04:14:48,920
This is my absolute worst map.

6574
04:14:49,360 --> 04:14:50,340
Why is it your worst map?

6575
04:14:50,460 --> 04:14:52,380
What is it that makes this your worst map?

6576
04:14:52,620 --> 04:14:53,840
I just don't like the map.

6577
04:14:54,220 --> 04:14:55,260
I just hate this map.

6578
04:14:56,700 --> 04:14:59,040
I was gonna say something really fucked up.

6579
04:15:00,540 --> 04:15:01,640
Are you gonna call me bad?

6580
04:15:03,100 --> 04:15:04,880
No, I was gonna say like...

6581
04:15:04,880 --> 04:15:06,520
Are we banning Bucky first?

6582
04:15:06,660 --> 04:15:07,360
Bucky, yeah.

6583
04:15:07,360 --> 04:15:08,520
Bucky, we don't...

6584
04:15:08,520 --> 04:15:11,000
They don't protect Bucky.

6585
04:15:11,680 --> 04:15:14,540
Star Lord or Mag, what's it gonna be?

6586
04:15:14,980 --> 04:15:16,200
Roll the dice.

6587
04:15:23,080 --> 04:15:24,860
What is it?

6588
04:15:28,980 --> 04:15:29,920
Namor, okay.

6589
04:15:30,720 --> 04:15:32,360
Can we just ban Luna?

6590
04:15:33,020 --> 04:15:34,200
Yeah, ban Luna.

6591
04:15:34,200 --> 04:15:35,820
Yeah, okay, so...

6592
04:15:37,380 --> 04:15:37,860
Do...

6593
04:15:37,860 --> 04:15:38,500
Save Mag.

6594
04:15:39,800 --> 04:15:41,000
And then ban Luna.

6595
04:15:43,020 --> 04:15:44,200
Back to triple tank.

6596
04:15:45,280 --> 04:15:45,340
Yay!

6597
04:15:48,200 --> 04:15:48,680
Woo!

6598
04:15:48,980 --> 04:15:49,620
Let's go!

6599
04:15:51,000 --> 04:15:53,160
Maybe they were thinking there's no way we ban Luna.

6600
04:15:54,380 --> 04:15:56,120
They didn't run Luna with their Namor.

6601
04:15:56,200 --> 04:15:56,760
That's the thing.

6602
04:15:57,900 --> 04:15:59,780
Yeah, like I looked at it and they only...

6603
04:15:59,780 --> 04:16:01,280
They ran...

6604
04:16:01,980 --> 04:16:02,340
Interesting.

6605
04:16:02,900 --> 04:16:05,280
They ran like...

6606
04:16:06,140 --> 04:16:09,820
Cause I looked and they ran Namor without a Luna, so I don't know.

6607
04:16:11,700 --> 04:16:16,820
Okay, so this comp is really bad at pushing this specific choke, so we're gonna just TP.

6608
04:16:18,220 --> 04:16:18,580
Okay.

6609
04:16:18,580 --> 04:16:19,460
We're gonna do a thing.

6610
04:16:19,640 --> 04:16:22,620
So you put your clones in first for emo and then I'll still link us later.

6611
04:16:23,100 --> 04:16:23,220
After.

6612
04:16:25,460 --> 04:16:27,400
Oh, where I'm putting us is you don't have to do that.

6613
04:16:27,520 --> 04:16:27,940
Oh, okay.

6614
04:16:28,200 --> 04:16:31,520
I'm just gonna put us like in the back so then we can rotate around and put us on high ground.

6615
04:16:33,080 --> 04:16:35,140
I mean, you still do the emo thing first.

6616
04:16:35,880 --> 04:16:38,160
I'll just like still link as soon as your emo's done.

6617
04:16:38,940 --> 04:16:39,420
Yep.

6618
04:16:40,360 --> 04:16:40,900
Do that.

6619
04:16:43,200 --> 04:16:43,660
Yay!

6620
04:16:45,220 --> 04:16:45,700
Yay!

6621
04:16:46,060 --> 04:16:47,180
No Star Lord.

6622
04:16:47,520 --> 04:16:48,000
Woo!

6623
04:16:48,500 --> 04:16:49,700
No Star Lord!

6624
04:16:49,780 --> 04:16:50,300
No Luna!

6625
04:16:50,880 --> 04:16:51,360
Yay!

6626
04:16:52,520 --> 04:16:55,020
Okay, if this comp doesn't work, what do we swap to?

6627
04:16:56,460 --> 04:16:57,380
I'll swap to...

6628
04:16:57,380 --> 04:16:59,140
I can just swap to a different thing.

6629
04:16:59,440 --> 04:17:00,600
I can go to...

6630
04:17:01,900 --> 04:17:02,980
I'll probably just go Wolverine.

6631
04:17:03,340 --> 04:17:05,900
I'd probably go Namor if this is not working but I think Loki.

6632
04:17:06,000 --> 04:17:06,640
We want Loki.

6633
04:17:06,920 --> 04:17:07,100
Yeah, okay.

6634
04:17:09,120 --> 04:17:10,420
Yeah, we'll just have Gomez swap then.

6635
04:17:10,420 --> 04:17:11,560
I'm so glad you played Loki.

6636
04:17:13,900 --> 04:17:16,420
I'm so glad he clicked through me.

6637
04:17:16,520 --> 04:17:17,900
I don't know why this character's so fun.

6638
04:17:18,160 --> 04:17:19,000
There's a world...

6639
04:17:19,000 --> 04:17:22,900
I mean, if you need to swap, I can go Strange and you can play a DPS.

6640
04:17:22,900 --> 04:17:25,120
Oh wait, we're insta-killing their Punisher.

6641
04:17:25,220 --> 04:17:25,300
Ready?

6642
04:17:25,600 --> 04:17:25,600
Okay.

6643
04:17:25,760 --> 04:17:27,260
Fucking shoot this shit.

6644
04:17:27,440 --> 04:17:27,780
Kill him.

6645
04:17:28,020 --> 04:17:28,820
Nice, I got him.

6646
04:17:34,640 --> 04:17:35,720
Walk up in.

6647
04:17:35,800 --> 04:17:36,440
Okay, we walk in.

6648
04:17:36,500 --> 04:17:37,140
We walk in right now.

6649
04:17:37,820 --> 04:17:37,820
Yep.

6650
04:17:39,080 --> 04:17:39,840
There it is!

6651
04:17:40,340 --> 04:17:43,180
Oh, I soul-linked us though.

6652
04:17:44,760 --> 04:17:45,520
Yeah, I'm...

6653
04:17:45,520 --> 04:17:46,160
I got us.

6654
04:17:47,440 --> 04:17:47,820
Reloading.

6655
04:17:48,920 --> 04:17:49,720
Cloak, cloak when you can!

6656
04:17:49,720 --> 04:17:49,980
Cloak!

6657
04:17:52,080 --> 04:17:53,360
Their Punisher's back, by the way.

6658
04:17:54,460 --> 04:17:55,180
Strange on me.

6659
04:17:55,600 --> 04:17:56,800
Strange on me as well.

6660
04:17:57,180 --> 04:17:57,560
Strange one!

6661
04:17:59,260 --> 04:18:00,180
We're good, we got it.

6662
04:18:01,660 --> 04:18:02,800
It's okay, don't worry.

6663
04:18:04,460 --> 04:18:05,400
You deal with it.

6664
04:18:05,580 --> 04:18:07,080
Their poor Punisher.

6665
04:18:07,280 --> 04:18:10,120
Dude, I went through the portal and things like turned around.

6666
04:18:10,280 --> 04:18:11,260
He did like a full 180.

6667
04:18:11,480 --> 04:18:11,940
That was weird.

6668
04:18:12,540 --> 04:18:14,300
I was trying to beat the shit out of that Punisher.

6669
04:18:16,040 --> 04:18:17,300
I just charged it up.

6670
04:18:17,300 --> 04:18:19,020
It was GG's for that guy.

6671
04:18:19,900 --> 04:18:20,720
That guy, yeah.

6672
04:18:22,140 --> 04:18:23,260
Oh, they're running Moon Knight.

6673
04:18:24,260 --> 04:18:25,180
Oh, there it is.

6674
04:18:25,260 --> 04:18:26,720
There it is.

6675
04:18:27,160 --> 04:18:28,380
It's because of your controls.

6676
04:18:29,940 --> 04:18:31,240
Oh my god, no!

6677
04:18:31,520 --> 04:18:32,680
See you later, guys.

6678
04:18:32,900 --> 04:18:34,100
I've got the healing, don't worry.

6679
04:18:34,420 --> 04:18:35,540
Don't worry, I've got the snaps.

6680
04:18:36,240 --> 04:18:37,560
My snaps are right here.

6681
04:18:38,580 --> 04:18:39,660
Trinja's low, Trinja's low.

6682
04:18:41,180 --> 04:18:42,180
I have ult here.

6683
04:18:42,720 --> 04:18:43,880
I can get active.

6684
04:18:43,880 --> 04:18:45,800
I'm going to look for some one shots.

6685
04:18:47,900 --> 04:18:48,780
Oh, that's not fun.

6686
04:18:49,200 --> 04:18:50,160
I got you, I got you.

6687
04:18:50,520 --> 04:18:53,300
Now I'm waiting for a club.

6688
04:18:54,680 --> 04:18:54,840
Okay.

6689
04:18:55,520 --> 04:18:56,300
I don't know where they are.

6690
04:18:56,840 --> 04:18:58,660
They're right behind us.

6691
04:19:00,640 --> 04:19:01,980
I still linked us, I still linked us.

6692
04:19:01,980 --> 04:19:02,620
No way.

6693
04:19:02,960 --> 04:19:03,460
Yeah, I got the soul link.

6694
04:19:07,440 --> 04:19:08,700
Get out of here.

6695
04:19:09,660 --> 04:19:10,200
Good shot.

6696
04:19:10,200 --> 04:19:11,760
They snagged their healer ult too.

6697
04:19:11,820 --> 04:19:12,660
Yeah, they snagged that.

6698
04:19:14,220 --> 04:19:16,080
I'll have... oh, but we also don't have support.

6699
04:19:16,420 --> 04:19:17,340
We have Rez.

6700
04:19:19,000 --> 04:19:19,320
Damn!

6701
04:19:19,860 --> 04:19:20,940
One support push up.

6702
04:19:22,060 --> 04:19:23,760
One support push up, because I'll have my ult anyway.

6703
04:19:24,480 --> 04:19:25,300
You guys heal one of them.

6704
04:19:29,520 --> 04:19:30,940
I can't do anything here.

6705
04:19:32,160 --> 04:19:33,760
Yeah, I can't get up there.

6706
04:19:34,300 --> 04:19:35,100
We have soul link here?

6707
04:19:35,480 --> 04:19:36,520
Yeah, we do.

6708
04:19:36,520 --> 04:19:38,100
I got...

6709
04:19:38,100 --> 04:19:38,380
He's dead.

6710
04:19:39,460 --> 04:19:42,560
They're looking for eye.

6711
04:19:42,920 --> 04:19:43,660
I'm backing up there.

6712
04:19:48,100 --> 04:19:48,780
Nice.

6713
04:19:50,120 --> 04:19:51,320
I'm healing, I'm healing.

6714
04:19:54,900 --> 04:19:55,580
Okay.

6715
04:20:00,440 --> 04:20:03,220
I used my Rez early then.

6716
04:20:03,720 --> 04:20:04,440
I thought we would win.

6717
04:20:04,440 --> 04:20:05,760
We would need that.

6718
04:20:06,020 --> 04:20:07,100
I might just ult there.

6719
04:20:07,600 --> 04:20:08,620
I got ult too.

6720
04:20:11,040 --> 04:20:12,080
Change, change, change.

6721
04:20:12,460 --> 04:20:12,940
I used Rage.

6722
04:20:17,300 --> 04:20:19,640
Door, door, door, door.

6723
04:20:22,060 --> 04:20:23,500
Oh my god, I fucking died.

6724
04:20:23,820 --> 04:20:26,260
Door, door, door.

6725
04:20:26,480 --> 04:20:27,320
I got you, I got you.

6726
04:20:28,100 --> 04:20:28,720
This door is behind.

6727
04:20:30,700 --> 04:20:31,180
I'm dead.

6728
04:20:31,180 --> 04:20:32,460
Nice, good kill, good kill.

6729
04:20:34,680 --> 04:20:35,640
I was supposed to low.

6730
04:20:37,000 --> 04:20:37,740
I got you.

6731
04:20:39,180 --> 04:20:40,420
I'm just getting invisible heal.

6732
04:20:42,560 --> 04:20:43,820
I don't have anymore ult.

6733
04:20:43,980 --> 04:20:46,580
Yeah, we have to reset.

6734
04:20:46,740 --> 04:20:47,340
Just reset, reset.

6735
04:20:49,200 --> 04:20:50,640
They should have support.

6736
04:20:50,780 --> 04:20:52,600
They have cloak ult by the way.

6737
04:20:53,220 --> 04:20:54,800
So, I'll try to come in there.

6738
04:20:55,000 --> 04:20:55,400
This is fine.

6739
04:20:56,400 --> 04:20:58,000
Yeah, I used my Rez too early there.

6740
04:20:59,340 --> 04:21:00,580
I thought it was winnable.

6741
04:21:03,080 --> 04:21:05,740
Did we have Mag ult for the Punisher?

6742
04:21:06,560 --> 04:21:07,040
Yeah, we did.

6743
04:21:07,200 --> 04:21:07,920
Should I use it there?

6744
04:21:08,400 --> 04:21:08,560
Yeah.

6745
04:21:09,180 --> 04:21:11,080
But they have cloak ult, so just use it for that.

6746
04:21:15,760 --> 04:21:16,720
I'm going to go over here.

6747
04:21:17,760 --> 04:21:19,280
I'm going to do something.

6748
04:21:19,360 --> 04:21:20,060
I'm going to do something goofy.

6749
04:21:20,240 --> 04:21:20,640
I'm going behind.

6750
04:21:22,180 --> 04:21:22,900
I'll go with you.

6751
04:21:24,280 --> 04:21:25,180
Just me, just me.

6752
04:21:25,920 --> 04:21:26,400
Walk up.

6753
04:21:26,540 --> 04:21:27,120
You can walk up.

6754
04:21:27,260 --> 04:21:27,880
Yeah, walk up.

6755
04:21:27,940 --> 04:21:28,460
Give them space.

6756
04:21:28,600 --> 04:21:29,000
They know.

6757
04:21:30,020 --> 04:21:31,460
I'm going back around.

6758
04:21:31,760 --> 04:21:32,120
Back around.

6759
04:21:35,100 --> 04:21:35,740
Thor low?

6760
04:21:36,680 --> 04:21:36,860
No.

6761
04:21:37,020 --> 04:21:37,140
Okay.

6762
04:21:38,720 --> 04:21:39,360
Copy that.

6763
04:21:39,500 --> 04:21:39,760
Let's go.

6764
04:21:40,620 --> 04:21:41,000
Let's do it.

6765
04:21:43,740 --> 04:21:46,560
Sorry, I heard copy, so I thought we were low team.

6766
04:21:46,700 --> 04:21:47,460
I don't have it.

6767
04:21:47,520 --> 04:21:48,060
I did not have it.

6768
04:21:49,240 --> 04:21:50,120
I have ult up.

6769
04:21:50,260 --> 04:21:50,700
Popping it.

6770
04:21:51,680 --> 04:21:52,300
Oh, it's big.

6771
04:21:52,300 --> 04:21:53,740
Big, big, big.

6772
04:21:54,120 --> 04:21:56,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

6773
04:21:56,200 --> 04:21:58,220
I don't have...

6774
04:21:59,800 --> 04:22:01,200
Please focus on Thor.

6775
04:22:01,240 --> 04:22:01,960
Good job, good job.

6776
04:22:02,300 --> 04:22:04,640
Okay, my bad, my bad.

6777
04:22:04,840 --> 04:22:04,920
Hold on.

6778
04:22:05,180 --> 04:22:05,920
I forgot Lime.

6779
04:22:06,520 --> 04:22:09,560
I say copy in scrims whenever it comes to...

6780
04:22:09,560 --> 04:22:10,600
Just do mirror.

6781
04:22:11,480 --> 04:22:12,460
Say mirror.

6782
04:22:13,320 --> 04:22:14,260
I'll say mirror.

6783
04:22:16,120 --> 04:22:17,440
Just say mirror.

6784
04:22:18,100 --> 04:22:18,980
Say your name.

6785
04:22:18,980 --> 04:22:20,260
I'm going to say your name next time.

6786
04:22:21,020 --> 04:22:21,280
Alright.

6787
04:22:22,740 --> 04:22:24,000
I'll say the name first.

6788
04:22:24,000 --> 04:22:24,260
Yeah.

6789
04:22:26,300 --> 04:22:27,480
I want to do things though.

6790
04:22:28,880 --> 04:22:29,580
Oh, never mind.

6791
04:22:30,260 --> 04:22:31,520
I will do...

6792
04:22:31,520 --> 04:22:32,540
I have ult here.

6793
04:22:32,820 --> 04:22:34,500
I'm going to...

6794
04:22:34,500 --> 04:22:35,640
I'm flying up.

6795
04:22:35,760 --> 04:22:36,480
I'm doing the old thing.

6796
04:22:36,640 --> 04:22:37,960
Oh, that's what you do.

6797
04:22:38,020 --> 04:22:38,580
Okay, got it.

6798
04:22:38,920 --> 04:22:39,120
Ready?

6799
04:22:39,180 --> 04:22:39,460
You are.

6800
04:22:39,680 --> 04:22:40,900
3, 2, 1, go.

6801
04:22:41,900 --> 04:22:43,240
Nice, nice.

6802
04:22:43,900 --> 04:22:44,460
I got you.

6803
04:22:45,160 --> 04:22:46,240
I'm on Punisher.

6804
04:22:46,380 --> 04:22:48,060
Punisher 1.

6805
04:22:48,420 --> 04:22:49,500
I got you.

6806
04:22:51,320 --> 04:22:52,520
Oh, the eye.

6807
04:22:52,980 --> 04:22:53,120
Alright.

6808
04:22:54,560 --> 04:22:55,020
Portal.

6809
04:22:55,460 --> 04:22:55,460
Portal.

6810
04:22:57,500 --> 04:22:58,540
It's huge.

6811
04:22:59,700 --> 04:23:00,520
Oh my god.

6812
04:23:00,680 --> 04:23:01,900
Dude, the portal too.

6813
04:23:02,160 --> 04:23:03,720
We want to win.

6814
04:23:03,940 --> 04:23:04,620
I think I messed it up.

6815
04:23:05,040 --> 04:23:07,560
But we have copy too.

6816
04:23:08,040 --> 04:23:08,760
Storm ulted?

6817
04:23:11,000 --> 04:23:12,740
Oh, he stopped.

6818
04:23:12,740 --> 04:23:13,700
Oh my god.

6819
04:23:13,700 --> 04:23:15,820
What the fuck?

6820
04:23:16,100 --> 04:23:17,000
Oh my god.

6821
04:23:17,160 --> 04:23:22,000
He just watched that happen.

6822
04:23:22,400 --> 04:23:23,060
What the fuck?

6823
04:23:23,420 --> 04:23:24,140
He's just watching.

6824
04:23:24,400 --> 04:23:25,280
He's storm chasing.

6825
04:23:25,880 --> 04:23:27,180
Bro, I think...

6826
04:23:27,180 --> 04:23:28,640
How did he get out?

6827
04:23:29,340 --> 04:23:31,820
The portal ended.

6828
04:23:32,200 --> 04:23:33,000
No, he got out.

6829
04:23:34,490 --> 04:23:37,120
No, the Punisher just like...

6830
04:23:37,120 --> 04:23:38,080
phased through the portal.

6831
04:23:42,900 --> 04:23:43,780
That's crazy.

6832
04:23:44,280 --> 04:23:47,160
There's a small tech that no one knows at the moment.

6833
04:23:47,620 --> 04:23:48,940
Clearly not the Punisher.

6834
04:23:49,900 --> 04:23:51,860
I think the Punisher was doing it on purpose.

6835
04:23:52,020 --> 04:23:53,460
I think he was.

6836
04:23:54,200 --> 04:24:03,040
If you position your camera outside of the portal while trying to back up, the game will try to correct your position based off the portal and if it glitches out properly, then you teleport past the portal.

6837
04:24:04,740 --> 04:24:06,660
I watched the fucking murder.

6838
04:24:06,660 --> 04:24:06,860
Dude.

6839
04:24:10,340 --> 04:24:11,840
No, but we got the point though.

6840
04:24:14,240 --> 04:24:17,500
Dude, I think they needed the Luna there for what they wanted to do.

6841
04:24:17,660 --> 04:24:18,880
They didn't run Namor.

6842
04:24:19,700 --> 04:24:21,700
Yeah, they didn't run Namor at all during the first.

6843
04:24:21,900 --> 04:24:22,600
They just went Punisher.

6844
04:24:24,300 --> 04:24:25,560
Do you think they'll mirror us?

6845
04:24:25,720 --> 04:24:28,020
Focus on Punisher ult or Cloak and Dagger for this.

6846
04:24:28,420 --> 04:24:29,740
I think it's whoever's first.

6847
04:24:31,000 --> 04:24:34,500
If Punisher ult's first, you just fucking spike that ball.

6848
04:24:35,120 --> 04:24:36,000
Got it.

6849
04:24:36,540 --> 04:24:38,680
I'm playing from up here.

6850
04:24:38,860 --> 04:24:39,060
Okay.

6851
04:24:39,720 --> 04:24:40,660
I like to say this.

6852
04:24:42,940 --> 04:24:48,020
Cloak ult's not as strong as it was before where it was literally necessary to kill a Cloak every time.

6853
04:24:49,260 --> 04:24:50,860
So it's not really...

6854
04:24:50,860 --> 04:24:52,160
Portal, portal, portal.

6855
04:24:53,060 --> 04:24:54,400
Alright, they're gonna do that to us?

6856
04:24:54,540 --> 04:24:55,840
Oh, I'm gonna...

6857
04:24:55,840 --> 04:24:57,540
We're gonna portal too.

6858
04:24:58,060 --> 04:24:58,860
They're probably up here.

6859
04:25:00,180 --> 04:25:01,520
I'm like by myself.

6860
04:25:02,480 --> 04:25:03,960
Or high ground on you.

6861
04:25:04,540 --> 04:25:05,560
Nope, right there.

6862
04:25:06,360 --> 04:25:07,960
I accidentally dropped off my high ground.

6863
04:25:09,560 --> 04:25:10,420
That's fine.

6864
04:25:11,940 --> 04:25:12,440
Whoa!

6865
04:25:12,560 --> 04:25:13,160
What the fuck?

6866
04:25:14,360 --> 04:25:15,400
Are you okay?

6867
04:25:15,640 --> 04:25:19,060
I tried to hug Strange and I jumped for Adam.

6868
04:25:20,180 --> 04:25:20,760
It was actually...

6869
04:25:20,760 --> 04:25:22,420
You landed on me.

6870
04:25:22,700 --> 04:25:23,680
Oh my god, they're stuck.

6871
04:25:26,060 --> 04:25:29,320
Yeah, they got stuck.

6872
04:25:29,320 --> 04:25:30,120
They didn't jump.

6873
04:25:30,360 --> 04:25:31,760
Oh, is it that Strange bug?

6874
04:25:32,620 --> 04:25:35,160
Nah, I think they just didn't commit.

6875
04:25:35,280 --> 04:25:35,840
They just didn't jump.

6876
04:25:36,940 --> 04:25:38,360
They would've died if they did, I think.

6877
04:25:38,700 --> 04:25:40,400
Yeah, I mean that's smart of them.

6878
04:25:40,980 --> 04:25:42,220
Alright, I'm dropping on them here.

6879
04:25:43,720 --> 04:25:44,440
Coming in too.

6880
04:25:45,280 --> 04:25:45,840
Jump scare.

6881
04:25:47,200 --> 04:25:48,380
Taking out Rocket's thing?

6882
04:25:48,700 --> 04:25:49,440
Okay, he dropped it.

6883
04:25:49,880 --> 04:25:50,680
I almost have ult here.

6884
04:25:53,240 --> 04:25:54,040
Thank you.

6885
04:25:56,220 --> 04:25:57,140
Give me this.

6886
04:25:58,340 --> 04:25:59,400
I'm pulling them in.

6887
04:25:59,760 --> 04:26:00,660
Alright, that's good.

6888
04:26:02,820 --> 04:26:03,760
Oh, I got them all up.

6889
04:26:04,020 --> 04:26:04,460
Nice.

6890
04:26:04,680 --> 04:26:05,860
I'm so lazy for you.

6891
04:26:06,080 --> 04:26:08,940
I can pull.

6892
04:26:09,480 --> 04:26:09,980
Rocket one.

6893
04:26:11,600 --> 04:26:12,480
Got it.

6894
04:26:13,900 --> 04:26:15,320
Oh shit, Coni!

6895
04:26:15,720 --> 04:26:16,700
Oh, he's one.

6896
04:26:18,360 --> 04:26:19,160
Alright, nice.

6897
04:26:19,360 --> 04:26:20,040
Alright, did they die?

6898
04:26:20,360 --> 04:26:20,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6899
04:26:22,360 --> 04:26:23,640
You should've punished ult.

6900
04:26:23,640 --> 04:26:25,640
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

6901
04:26:25,680 --> 04:26:26,960
Give me a jump, give me a jump.

6902
04:26:27,040 --> 04:26:27,340
I'm good.

6903
04:26:27,880 --> 04:26:29,380
I wanna ult them here.

6904
04:26:30,320 --> 04:26:31,540
I mean, I will let you know.

6905
04:26:31,760 --> 04:26:32,220
It looks so juicy.

6906
04:26:33,060 --> 04:26:34,120
I'll let you know.

6907
04:26:34,300 --> 04:26:37,580
Okay, I got it.

6908
04:26:37,940 --> 04:26:39,320
Oh my god!

6909
04:26:39,740 --> 04:26:40,520
Oh my god.

6910
04:26:41,740 --> 04:26:42,680
Oh, nice.

6911
04:26:44,140 --> 04:26:46,100
That was a big ult.

6912
04:26:47,360 --> 04:26:48,300
That's the eye.

6913
04:26:50,720 --> 04:26:51,600
How do you say it?

6914
04:26:51,600 --> 04:26:52,860
How do you say it?

6915
04:26:54,500 --> 04:26:55,040
What's up?

6916
04:26:55,440 --> 04:26:56,140
How do you scream that?

6917
04:27:00,300 --> 04:27:01,620
Now I feel special.

6918
04:27:01,980 --> 04:27:03,280
Let's fucking go.

6919
04:27:04,080 --> 04:27:05,760
Let's go with...

6920
04:27:06,380 --> 04:27:07,820
Let's actually go aggressive here with Link.

6921
04:27:07,940 --> 04:27:08,360
Can we do that?

6922
04:27:08,760 --> 04:27:11,260
I'm gonna drop down from up here.

6923
04:27:13,700 --> 04:27:14,920
Infinite ammo, infinite ammo.

6924
04:27:15,260 --> 04:27:15,880
Watch out.

6925
04:27:18,160 --> 04:27:19,720
Okay, I got blown the fuck up.

6926
04:27:19,720 --> 04:27:21,400
They got shielded.

6927
04:27:21,480 --> 04:27:21,920
Yeah.

6928
04:27:23,280 --> 04:27:25,160
Yeah, I got blown the fuck up.

6929
04:27:25,280 --> 04:27:26,720
Uh oh, they disappeared too.

6930
04:27:29,640 --> 04:27:31,040
I can't grab 20.

6931
04:27:31,780 --> 04:27:33,240
Oh, I got hit.

6932
04:27:34,460 --> 04:27:35,040
I'm on the way.

6933
04:27:36,460 --> 04:27:37,580
Oh my god.

6934
04:27:37,640 --> 04:27:38,680
Yeah, they used everything.

6935
04:27:38,860 --> 04:27:39,080
I'm trying.

6936
04:27:42,200 --> 04:27:43,080
I got...

6937
04:27:43,780 --> 04:27:45,080
They don't know I'm here.

6938
04:27:45,800 --> 04:27:46,020
They don't know.

6939
04:27:46,020 --> 04:27:47,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6940
04:27:47,220 --> 04:27:48,620
Two of the supports are still alive.

6941
04:27:49,360 --> 04:27:50,220
I'm backing up.

6942
04:27:50,340 --> 04:27:53,000
I got you, I got you.

6943
04:27:53,420 --> 04:27:54,380
Where are you?

6944
04:27:55,960 --> 04:27:57,080
I'm ulting here.

6945
04:27:58,900 --> 04:27:59,820
Meg, meg, meg.

6946
04:27:59,940 --> 04:28:00,320
Got it.

6947
04:28:02,080 --> 04:28:02,460
Okay.

6948
04:28:04,580 --> 04:28:05,340
Nice recovery.

6949
04:28:05,620 --> 04:28:06,420
Don't lose those.

6950
04:28:07,960 --> 04:28:08,960
That's good, that's good.

6951
04:28:09,160 --> 04:28:10,500
I'm gonna save ult for Punisher.

6952
04:28:12,120 --> 04:28:13,320
I'm going back up top.

6953
04:28:13,320 --> 04:28:14,320
They might TP.

6954
04:28:15,060 --> 04:28:16,380
They have to TP.

6955
04:28:17,220 --> 04:28:18,260
Yeah, they have to.

6956
04:28:19,700 --> 04:28:20,740
I'm staying up here.

6957
04:28:21,360 --> 04:28:21,900
Oh, I just got nothing.

6958
04:28:24,080 --> 04:28:27,260
I'm gonna just like float above them if they try to do the same spot.

6959
04:28:27,620 --> 04:28:27,980
Right here.

6960
04:28:28,880 --> 04:28:29,320
Oh,

6961
04:28:32,800 --> 04:28:33,180
they faded.

6962
04:28:34,040 --> 04:28:34,480
Wait.

6963
04:28:35,420 --> 04:28:36,340
Whoa, what the fuck?

6964
04:28:37,820 --> 04:28:38,700
Doki coming up there.

6965
04:28:39,700 --> 04:28:40,040
Goodbye.

6966
04:28:42,120 --> 04:28:43,660
He just won the 1v1.

6967
04:28:44,780 --> 04:28:46,920
Wait, they're letting me build so much ult charge right now.

6968
04:28:47,000 --> 04:28:47,380
It's insane.

6969
04:28:48,040 --> 04:28:49,480
You're really gonna challenge me?

6970
04:28:50,060 --> 04:28:50,860
Like, really?

6971
04:28:52,800 --> 04:28:54,060
Bodyblock Raccoon, good shit.

6972
04:28:54,580 --> 04:28:55,640
I'm healing, I'm healing.

6973
04:28:56,460 --> 04:28:57,660
I got you, I got you, I got you.

6974
04:28:57,940 --> 04:28:59,000
He still wants to kill me.

6975
04:29:00,640 --> 04:29:03,580
Bro, that Punisher wanted to kill me so bad.

6976
04:29:03,740 --> 04:29:06,280
I saw the Punisher come up there, I was like, No, Doki!

6977
04:29:06,440 --> 04:29:08,100
And by the time I jumped, he was dead.

6978
04:29:08,100 --> 04:29:11,520
I, like, tried to jump up there to help.

6979
04:29:17,470 --> 04:29:18,430
Good shit.

6980
04:29:19,210 --> 04:29:19,930
One more.

6981
04:29:20,630 --> 04:29:21,290
One more.

6982
04:29:22,610 --> 04:29:25,190
Okay, the thing is, do we put Jay in for this?

6983
04:29:25,310 --> 04:29:27,370
Or just keep Bettle in for the 3-3?

6984
04:29:28,650 --> 04:29:29,910
We can put him in.

6985
04:29:30,190 --> 04:29:30,570
Alright.

6986
04:29:31,750 --> 04:29:32,910
Time for the swap.

6987
04:29:34,270 --> 04:29:35,050
Bye, guys.

6988
04:29:35,770 --> 04:29:36,530
GG's, Bettle.

6989
04:29:37,530 --> 04:29:37,970
GG's.

6990
04:29:38,010 --> 04:29:39,930
You did great, Bettle.

6991
04:29:40,190 --> 04:29:41,050
You were insane.

6992
04:29:43,950 --> 04:29:45,170
I'm gonna miss him.

6993
04:29:45,510 --> 04:29:46,270
Bye, Bettle.

6994
04:29:47,070 --> 04:29:48,070
Good shit, Bettle.

6995
04:29:50,810 --> 04:29:51,550
Where's Jay?

6996
04:29:51,910 --> 04:29:52,750
Jay's not online.

6997
04:29:53,730 --> 04:29:54,550
Wait, Jay went offline.

6998
04:29:55,690 --> 04:29:56,370
At Jay.

6999
04:29:56,590 --> 04:29:57,730
Oh, wait, Jay, get back on.

7000
04:29:59,050 --> 04:29:59,810
What happened to Jay?

7001
04:30:00,930 --> 04:30:01,770
Where'd he go, Jay?

7002
04:30:02,010 --> 04:30:04,030
Jay, boot up your game right now.

7003
04:30:04,790 --> 04:30:05,390
Oh, shit.

7004
04:30:05,390 --> 04:30:07,090
Oh, I was playing the labs.

7005
04:30:10,690 --> 04:30:11,930
I'm coming, I'm coming.

7006
04:30:11,930 --> 04:30:15,310
Let me post the score thing.

7007
04:30:18,830 --> 04:30:19,350
Mystery.

7008
04:30:20,870 --> 04:30:22,390
We're really good with this comp.

7009
04:30:24,270 --> 04:30:26,310
You guys are killing it.

7010
04:30:26,390 --> 04:30:28,970
Yeah, because they keep target banning Starlord.

7011
04:30:30,230 --> 04:30:33,750
Yeah, and if they leave Slardar open, it's like, maybe even easier.

7012
04:30:34,410 --> 04:30:35,170
They're on there.

7013
04:30:35,470 --> 04:30:37,810
I think this comp is more about team synergy.

7014
04:30:38,370 --> 04:30:40,950
It's more so focused on our team play.

7015
04:30:42,310 --> 04:30:42,630
I agree.

7016
04:30:55,070 --> 04:30:55,510
Alright.

7017
04:30:57,150 --> 04:30:58,070
Is Jay in here yet?

7018
04:31:00,630 --> 04:31:03,130
Hold on, give me like 10 seconds.

7019
04:31:03,730 --> 04:31:04,850
Our spectators are gone.

7020
04:31:05,250 --> 04:31:08,210
Since we're taking a second, I'm gonna restart my game so it doesn't crash.

7021
04:31:08,470 --> 04:31:08,510
Oh, yeah, true.

7022
04:31:08,850 --> 04:31:11,530
Our casters are gone, too.

7023
04:31:14,570 --> 04:31:15,810
I'll just reboot.

7024
04:31:17,110 --> 04:31:18,810
It's been a while, so I'm due for one.

7025
04:31:20,870 --> 04:31:21,930
Wait, should I restart, too?

7026
04:31:22,790 --> 04:31:25,010
If you don't get game crashes, then don't worry about it.

7027
04:31:25,650 --> 04:31:26,910
Yeah, don't worry about it.

7028
04:31:26,970 --> 04:31:31,790
Mine crashes every 5-10 games, but if I restart, it's fine.

7029
04:31:31,830 --> 04:31:32,910
It's like a memory leak, I guess.

7030
04:31:34,330 --> 04:31:34,950
It's weird.

7031
04:31:37,070 --> 04:31:41,790
Apparently, it's like common with the GeForce 30 series.

7032
04:31:42,250 --> 04:31:46,390
A bunch of people on the Reddit are like, yeah, I did this, and it doesn't work for anybody.

7033
04:31:47,470 --> 04:31:48,730
Did you back up your drivers?

7034
04:31:49,410 --> 04:31:50,370
Yeah, I did everything.

7035
04:31:51,190 --> 04:31:53,330
I had to restart every 5 games or something.

7036
04:31:53,990 --> 04:31:56,650
Wait, you got your Twitch Rivals money, didn't you?

7037
04:31:57,250 --> 04:31:58,850
Yeah, but I can't get a 50-90 anywhere.

7038
04:31:58,930 --> 04:31:59,810
They're impossible to find.

7039
04:32:00,410 --> 04:32:04,150
Yeah, I don't want to do the campout thing.

7040
04:32:05,690 --> 04:32:07,330
The nearest microcenter is...

7041
04:32:07,330 --> 04:32:08,450
I'll get one for you.

7042
04:32:08,970 --> 04:32:09,450
Please?

7043
04:32:09,810 --> 04:32:11,130
Are you going to campout?

7044
04:32:11,810 --> 04:32:14,410
I might do it again, just to get another one.

7045
04:32:14,590 --> 04:32:15,590
Wait, why do you need two?

7046
04:32:17,730 --> 04:32:20,290
I have a 50-80 right now.

7047
04:32:20,770 --> 04:32:22,030
So I just...

7048
04:32:22,030 --> 04:32:24,310
It barely performs better than a 40-80.

7049
04:32:24,590 --> 04:32:29,410
Wait, people are saying the 50-90 crash has a lot of problems right now, though.

7050
04:32:30,570 --> 04:32:33,490
There's some really bad driver things going on right now.

7051
04:32:33,490 --> 04:32:34,090
Yeah.

7052
04:32:37,070 --> 04:32:37,970
Alright, I'm back on.

7053
04:32:38,410 --> 04:32:39,730
Shoot me an invite, please.

7054
04:32:52,250 --> 04:32:55,310
Well, okay.

7055
04:32:55,470 --> 04:32:56,710
There's a thing that makes sense.

7056
04:32:57,630 --> 04:33:01,270
Usually, every release for newer GPUs always has a bunch of crashes.

7057
04:33:01,710 --> 04:33:02,930
So it's not really...

7058
04:33:04,030 --> 04:33:06,370
It's a really common thing at the beginning.

7059
04:33:07,730 --> 04:33:08,490
Oh, I see.

7060
04:33:08,570 --> 04:33:09,730
I don't think we have casters.

7061
04:33:09,810 --> 04:33:11,250
I think they left us.

7062
04:33:11,250 --> 04:33:11,770
Oh.

7063
04:33:13,350 --> 04:33:15,250
They're like, damn, this game is ass!

7064
04:33:15,390 --> 04:33:17,670
I think the casters aren't casting us anymore.

7065
04:33:19,310 --> 04:33:20,350
Is that it?

7066
04:33:20,390 --> 04:33:21,070
I checked their Twitch.

7067
04:33:21,530 --> 04:33:22,490
I'm confused.

7068
04:33:22,670 --> 04:33:23,790
Where did they go?

7069
04:33:25,050 --> 04:33:26,410
Let me check their Twitch.

7070
04:33:27,190 --> 04:33:28,790
Where did our casters go?

7071
04:33:28,990 --> 04:33:29,950
Did they leave us?

7072
04:33:30,050 --> 04:33:33,410
Do they just don't want to watch this anymore because we're going ghost?

7073
04:33:36,350 --> 04:33:37,130
Next match.

7074
04:33:37,690 --> 04:33:38,830
Team Jeff fan club.

7075
04:33:38,830 --> 04:33:40,210
Yeah, they left us.

7076
04:33:40,330 --> 04:33:42,310
What was that?

7077
04:33:42,610 --> 04:33:44,530
They left us after one game?

7078
04:33:45,670 --> 04:33:47,510
One game and they killed it?

7079
04:33:47,930 --> 04:33:48,690
Wait, but who's the leader?

7080
04:33:49,870 --> 04:33:52,990
I mean, too bad we're running Ghost Legends.

7081
04:33:53,430 --> 04:33:58,350
I guess we're making...

7082
04:33:58,350 --> 04:33:59,470
Oh, I guess one of us has to...

7083
04:33:59,470 --> 04:34:01,390
Wait, who's...

7084
04:34:01,390 --> 04:34:03,130
I guess we make a new lobby.

7085
04:34:03,750 --> 04:34:04,870
Let's just make a new lobby.

7086
04:34:05,370 --> 04:34:06,890
And we'll invite them in.

7087
04:34:11,310 --> 04:34:13,530
They're like, I'm not here to watch ghosts.

7088
04:34:13,870 --> 04:34:15,630
We want to watch DPS players.

7089
04:34:20,010 --> 04:34:20,410
Alright.

7090
04:34:23,510 --> 04:34:24,310
Let me...

7091
04:34:24,310 --> 04:34:25,250
Wait, sorry.

7092
04:34:25,330 --> 04:34:26,190
I was looking at something.

7093
04:34:26,350 --> 04:34:26,890
What did you say?

7094
04:34:26,910 --> 04:34:28,610
You're making a new lobby for us.

7095
04:34:29,190 --> 04:34:29,550
Am I?

7096
04:34:29,690 --> 04:34:29,830
Alright.

7097
04:34:32,930 --> 04:34:33,330
Boom.

7098
04:34:34,310 --> 04:34:34,750
Boom.

7099
04:34:35,230 --> 04:34:36,290
I'll invite all of you.

7100
04:34:37,350 --> 04:34:37,950
No, wait.

7101
04:34:38,130 --> 04:34:38,750
I bought a battle.

7102
04:34:39,290 --> 04:34:39,490
Oh, shit.

7103
04:34:40,410 --> 04:34:42,090
Oh, he's here.

7104
04:34:44,550 --> 04:34:46,330
It was like, me?

7105
04:34:48,130 --> 04:34:49,550
Oh, that's tough.

7106
04:34:51,090 --> 04:34:53,050
I gave you the ID for the other captain.

7107
04:34:54,410 --> 04:34:56,010
I went to my recent...

7108
04:34:56,010 --> 04:34:57,530
I failed to send a request.

7109
04:34:58,930 --> 04:35:00,290
I can invite them too.

7110
04:35:00,290 --> 04:35:01,190
Wait, they're in a room.

7111
04:35:02,310 --> 04:35:03,650
Why are they in a room?

7112
04:35:04,670 --> 04:35:05,090
We should...

7113
04:35:06,510 --> 04:35:07,230
Oh, okay.

7114
04:35:07,270 --> 04:35:07,950
We're supposed to join them.

7115
04:35:08,250 --> 04:35:09,190
Wait, but we're first.

7116
04:35:09,430 --> 04:35:10,070
We're the top.

7117
04:35:12,270 --> 04:35:13,150
I don't know.

7118
04:35:13,330 --> 04:35:15,290
I don't know.

7119
04:35:15,890 --> 04:35:17,370
They can be in charge of the room.

7120
04:35:17,490 --> 04:35:18,010
I don't care.

7121
04:35:20,390 --> 04:35:22,750
Oh, we left battle.

7122
04:35:26,330 --> 04:35:27,870
JK, you thought you were gonna play.

7123
04:35:31,190 --> 04:35:32,230
Okay, I got Shoto.

7124
04:35:33,570 --> 04:35:35,990
Yeah, I'm like...

7125
04:35:35,990 --> 04:35:37,470
Shoto, I'm not used to...

7126
04:35:37,470 --> 04:35:39,010
I'm used to everyone's names being at the top.

7127
04:35:39,110 --> 04:35:40,370
And yours is all the way down.

7128
04:35:40,690 --> 04:35:43,030
He has too many friends.

7129
04:35:44,370 --> 04:35:45,870
Wait, the caster came back.

7130
04:35:46,150 --> 04:35:46,850
Wait, they came back.

7131
04:35:47,650 --> 04:35:48,450
Oh, they came back?

7132
04:35:48,570 --> 04:35:51,690
I thought they didn't want to watch us anymore.

7133
04:35:55,250 --> 04:35:57,090
I didn't want to play anyway.

7134
04:35:57,090 --> 04:35:57,890
Okay, it's cool.

7135
04:36:00,690 --> 04:36:02,250
We are...

7136
04:36:02,250 --> 04:36:03,230
I'm sorry, battle.

7137
04:36:04,750 --> 04:36:06,310
We are...

7138
04:36:06,310 --> 04:36:08,250
Yeah, I said we are.

7139
04:36:13,350 --> 04:36:16,810
I like how he question marked you too.

7140
04:36:21,890 --> 04:36:23,930
Battle added Gomez.

7141
04:36:24,390 --> 04:36:25,010
That's cool.

7142
04:36:25,070 --> 04:36:26,050
I didn't want to play anyway.

7143
04:36:32,010 --> 04:36:33,390
I said we are ready.

7144
04:36:34,090 --> 04:36:36,850
So, whenever they are ready, we will start the game.

7145
04:36:36,910 --> 04:36:37,510
What map are we doing?

7146
04:36:37,750 --> 04:36:39,390
Oh, we are doing Koth.

7147
04:36:40,670 --> 04:36:41,610
It's Koth time.

7148
04:36:42,530 --> 04:36:43,550
One more game.

7149
04:36:43,710 --> 04:36:44,930
One more game and we are free.

7150
04:36:45,630 --> 04:36:47,210
And I don't think...

7151
04:36:47,210 --> 04:36:48,390
You are not gonna be late, right?

7152
04:36:48,490 --> 04:36:50,530
To your tournament.

7153
04:36:52,570 --> 04:36:53,950
Didn't he say it started at 3?

7154
04:36:54,470 --> 04:36:55,570
Yeah, 3 PST, right?

7155
04:36:57,530 --> 04:36:57,970
Oh, no.

7156
04:36:58,470 --> 04:37:00,630
Oh, he's not even there.

7157
04:37:01,950 --> 04:37:03,510
Oh, he's not alive.

7158
04:37:04,250 --> 04:37:05,350
Oh, this is...

7159
04:37:05,350 --> 04:37:06,130
No, I'm here.

7160
04:37:07,910 --> 04:37:09,630
Is your tournament starting at 3 PST?

7161
04:37:10,870 --> 04:37:11,810
3 PST or ESC?

7162
04:37:12,130 --> 04:37:12,670
Oh, it's already passed.

7163
04:37:13,830 --> 04:37:14,450
They are starting it.

7164
04:37:15,450 --> 04:37:17,110
Okay, we win this fast.

7165
04:37:17,250 --> 04:37:18,150
99-0.

7166
04:37:18,150 --> 04:37:20,050
They hope we will get to the next game.

7167
04:37:21,630 --> 04:37:23,530
I thought we had to do a grand final.

7168
04:37:23,790 --> 04:37:24,470
Or a winner's final.

7169
04:37:25,190 --> 04:37:26,050
That's tomorrow.

7170
04:37:27,790 --> 04:37:29,190
If we win this, we are done.

7171
04:37:29,710 --> 04:37:30,970
I guess we are done either way.

7172
04:37:31,950 --> 04:37:32,430
Bucky.

7173
04:37:32,970 --> 04:37:33,330
Bucky.

7174
04:37:33,770 --> 04:37:34,250
Bucky.

7175
04:37:37,930 --> 04:37:39,210
Are you okay?

7176
04:37:40,930 --> 04:37:41,370
Alright.

7177
04:37:41,590 --> 04:37:43,170
Are they gonna have a Star Lord?

7178
04:37:43,170 --> 04:37:43,410
Star Lord.

7179
04:37:46,530 --> 04:37:48,370
Oh, there it is.

7180
04:37:49,270 --> 04:37:50,230
Got him.

7181
04:37:52,730 --> 04:37:54,470
Looks like I'm on Magneto.

7182
04:37:57,730 --> 04:37:59,610
Oh, magic.

7183
04:38:00,570 --> 04:38:02,610
They want to do magic to counter it, probably.

7184
04:38:02,850 --> 04:38:03,490
Is that what I'm saying?

7185
04:38:04,950 --> 04:38:06,970
Since we have Jay, do we save Thing?

7186
04:38:07,550 --> 04:38:08,210
What do you want to do?

7187
04:38:08,510 --> 04:38:10,270
Because we need to save Magna.

7188
04:38:10,270 --> 04:38:11,690
We can save Thing.

7189
04:38:11,850 --> 04:38:12,570
Yeah, let's just save Thing.

7190
04:38:12,870 --> 04:38:15,130
I would like to save Thing for magic.

7191
04:38:16,810 --> 04:38:17,810
Venom is open by the way.

7192
04:38:18,110 --> 04:38:20,030
I can play Venom as well, if we need to.

7193
04:38:20,450 --> 04:38:20,970
Oh, we could.

7194
04:38:21,410 --> 04:38:21,470
Yeah.

7195
04:38:24,650 --> 04:38:26,590
Why don't we ban then?

7196
04:38:29,030 --> 04:38:29,750
Do we ban?

7197
04:38:30,470 --> 04:38:31,190
Namor or Luna?

7198
04:38:32,830 --> 04:38:33,750
Ban Luna again.

7199
04:38:34,030 --> 04:38:34,230
Luna?

7200
04:38:34,370 --> 04:38:34,590
Okay.

7201
04:38:36,150 --> 04:38:36,970
I'm down for that.

7202
04:38:37,170 --> 04:38:37,790
Get her out.

7203
04:38:38,550 --> 04:38:40,990
We just have a set ban line.

7204
04:38:42,050 --> 04:38:42,550
Which is pretty good.

7205
04:38:42,990 --> 04:38:44,370
So you can't play Luna anymore.

7206
04:38:45,230 --> 04:38:45,450
Yeah.

7207
04:38:46,090 --> 04:38:48,170
So we can run Flankers too if we want to.

7208
04:38:48,970 --> 04:38:49,190
Yeah.

7209
04:38:49,930 --> 04:38:50,250
Oh.

7210
04:38:51,690 --> 04:38:53,430
I'm going to be simple.

7211
04:38:55,390 --> 04:38:55,910
Alright.

7212
04:38:57,990 --> 04:38:59,630
I'm just the item player.

7213
04:38:59,910 --> 04:39:00,990
I'm Kurova, I guess.

7214
04:39:02,170 --> 04:39:03,270
Oh my god, are you going to kill everything?

7215
04:39:03,710 --> 04:39:04,010
No.

7216
04:39:07,850 --> 04:39:09,170
No, because I'm a team player.

7217
04:39:11,190 --> 04:39:11,710
Nah.

7218
04:39:12,990 --> 04:39:13,910
I like Adam.

7219
04:39:14,590 --> 04:39:16,790
I assume there's just too much stuff going on.

7220
04:39:17,650 --> 04:39:17,950
Yeah.

7221
04:39:18,790 --> 04:39:20,910
I'm too tired to think that far.

7222
04:39:25,570 --> 04:39:27,170
Oh, that's not good for you.

7223
04:39:27,290 --> 04:39:28,670
You have to play more games later.

7224
04:39:28,670 --> 04:39:29,750
Yeah, you have to play more.

7225
04:39:31,950 --> 04:39:33,530
You have to lock it in, bro.

7226
04:39:35,250 --> 04:39:37,150
We haven't done a domination in a second.

7227
04:39:37,790 --> 04:39:38,670
We did last match.

7228
04:39:40,090 --> 04:39:40,330
We did?

7229
04:39:40,570 --> 04:39:41,970
Oh my god, bro, my brain.

7230
04:39:42,090 --> 04:39:43,490
Yeah, because we hydrogen bombed them.

7231
04:39:43,810 --> 04:39:45,270
Oh, we hydrogen bombed them, that's why.

7232
04:39:47,010 --> 04:39:48,590
You guys didn't even notice it.

7233
04:39:49,370 --> 04:39:51,770
We had to hydrogen bomb this one too, guys.

7234
04:39:52,250 --> 04:39:53,630
This stuff was too hard.

7235
04:39:58,670 --> 04:39:59,150
Here we go.

7236
04:40:01,210 --> 04:40:03,350
Okay, so go through right room.

7237
04:40:04,050 --> 04:40:06,270
This one, this one, this one right here.

7238
04:40:07,910 --> 04:40:09,270
This one, this one.

7239
04:40:12,830 --> 04:40:16,590
Okay, let's go inside.

7240
04:40:18,230 --> 04:40:19,450
Are they main?

7241
04:40:19,910 --> 04:40:20,210
They're main.

7242
04:40:21,410 --> 04:40:21,490
Yep.

7243
04:40:23,150 --> 04:40:24,570
Do you have the thing?

7244
04:40:24,570 --> 04:40:26,710
Oh, I dropped down.

7245
04:40:27,370 --> 04:40:28,310
You got magic?

7246
04:40:28,490 --> 04:40:28,970
I picked up the magic.

7247
04:40:33,970 --> 04:40:36,730
I'm helping you, I'm helping you.

7248
04:40:37,290 --> 04:40:38,950
I'm soul bonding us, I'm soul bonding us.

7249
04:40:48,910 --> 04:40:50,910
I don't have any heals, I don't have any heals.

7250
04:40:52,590 --> 04:40:53,830
I don't have any heals here.

7251
04:40:53,830 --> 04:40:55,450
Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.

7252
04:40:55,470 --> 04:40:56,030
I am rezzing now.

7253
04:40:57,050 --> 04:40:58,710
I picked up the storm, I put them in.

7254
04:40:59,810 --> 04:41:00,210
Storm one.

7255
04:41:02,070 --> 04:41:04,410
Can we play this comp or swap?

7256
04:41:04,730 --> 04:41:06,030
I have to swap, I have to swap.

7257
04:41:11,160 --> 04:41:11,940
They can't kill me.

7258
04:41:12,060 --> 04:41:15,060
They already capped, so you guys have to die.

7259
04:41:15,760 --> 04:41:16,320
Yeah, okay.

7260
04:41:17,500 --> 04:41:19,700
They're gonna have storm ult, they have storm ult for this.

7261
04:41:22,120 --> 04:41:23,420
Yeah, I'm almost there.

7262
04:41:29,800 --> 04:41:31,460
I'll try to soul bond.

7263
04:41:32,080 --> 04:41:34,840
But we still need to use low heal, I think.

7264
04:41:35,080 --> 04:41:35,860
After the soul bond.

7265
04:41:37,560 --> 04:41:38,460
Oh my god.

7266
04:41:40,680 --> 04:41:42,400
Shoot the frontline, shoot frontline, shoot frontline.

7267
04:41:45,080 --> 04:41:46,440
Oh my god, a clobber.

7268
04:41:47,260 --> 04:41:48,460
I soul linked us.

7269
04:41:49,020 --> 04:41:52,060
They used two DPS ults here.

7270
04:41:53,420 --> 04:41:54,440
Can I ult when this is done?

7271
04:41:55,060 --> 04:41:55,380
I'll clob.

7272
04:41:58,820 --> 04:42:00,760
I'm going on point, okay?

7273
04:42:01,660 --> 04:42:02,380
I'm going on point, I'm going on point.

7274
04:42:02,880 --> 04:42:04,700
They're C laning, they're C laning.

7275
04:42:09,240 --> 04:42:10,720
I'm on the side right now.

7276
04:42:12,040 --> 04:42:13,640
I can TP to point at all of them.

7277
04:42:13,760 --> 04:42:14,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.

7278
04:42:15,240 --> 04:42:15,800
I have heal.

7279
04:42:18,740 --> 04:42:20,100
I'm rezzing, I'm rezzing.

7280
04:42:20,100 --> 04:42:21,000
I got three, I got three.

7281
04:42:21,220 --> 04:42:22,600
I'm TPing, I'm TPing, I'm TPing.

7282
04:42:24,820 --> 04:42:25,840
Oh, it's too far.

7283
04:42:25,960 --> 04:42:26,600
I'm too far away.

7284
04:42:27,100 --> 04:42:28,220
Oh no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

7285
04:42:28,360 --> 04:42:28,780
I'm good, I'm good.

7286
04:42:28,920 --> 04:42:30,940
I don't have snaps right now.

7287
04:42:32,120 --> 04:42:32,940
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

7288
04:42:33,260 --> 04:42:34,220
We have one fight.

7289
04:42:35,740 --> 04:42:36,480
Cloak, cloak, cloak.

7290
04:42:38,100 --> 04:42:38,960
Moon knight on high ground.

7291
04:42:40,040 --> 04:42:41,400
He's at absolute one, absolute one, absolute one.

7292
04:42:41,700 --> 04:42:42,280
I don't know if we can get him.

7293
04:42:45,880 --> 04:42:48,100
I might swap to cloak.

7294
04:42:49,000 --> 04:42:50,260
Cloak, I don't think...

7295
04:42:50,260 --> 04:42:51,040
Alright, we have enough heals.

7296
04:42:52,140 --> 04:42:52,740
Oh, nice.

7297
04:42:54,520 --> 04:42:56,860
This one's a hard map to heal properly on.

7298
04:42:57,860 --> 04:42:58,680
Nice, oh my god.

7299
04:42:59,780 --> 04:43:02,160
Same thing, I can shift up and I can drop down.

7300
04:43:02,380 --> 04:43:02,580
Okay.

7301
04:43:03,780 --> 04:43:05,200
They have clobbering.

7302
04:43:06,360 --> 04:43:06,640
Yeah, yeah.

7303
04:43:08,620 --> 04:43:10,400
You're on magic, they'll have magic ult too.

7304
04:43:10,980 --> 04:43:12,180
I can only still link one of these.

7305
04:43:12,940 --> 04:43:14,480
They're not going main?

7306
04:43:15,260 --> 04:43:16,020
Are they not?

7307
04:43:16,020 --> 04:43:16,280
They're not, right?

7308
04:43:17,420 --> 04:43:17,680
Is it?

7309
04:43:18,140 --> 04:43:20,560
Yeah, I can look for it.

7310
04:43:21,280 --> 04:43:23,400
Oh my god.

7311
04:43:26,380 --> 04:43:27,340
Am I going ult?

7312
04:43:28,220 --> 04:43:28,720
Oh my god.

7313
04:43:29,600 --> 04:43:30,140
Yeah, I don't think I can.

7314
04:43:30,320 --> 04:43:32,060
I don't have shift for like 10 seconds.

7315
04:43:32,740 --> 04:43:33,320
Magic's on me.

7316
04:43:36,560 --> 04:43:37,260
Magic ult.

7317
04:43:38,880 --> 04:43:39,240
Storm.

7318
04:43:39,680 --> 04:43:40,280
Storm ult.

7319
04:43:41,140 --> 04:43:41,940
I still linked up.

7320
04:43:42,040 --> 04:43:42,720
He missed, he missed.

7321
04:43:42,720 --> 04:43:43,180
Storm.

7322
04:43:45,940 --> 04:43:46,540
I'm holding it.

7323
04:43:47,220 --> 04:43:47,740
Magic ult.

7324
04:43:49,260 --> 04:43:51,000
Magic one, she got the health pack in mind.

7325
04:43:51,140 --> 04:43:52,620
I'm going to ult after the invis ult.

7326
04:43:52,900 --> 04:43:53,820
I'm going to ult after the invis ult.

7327
04:43:55,280 --> 04:43:56,160
I'm looking for it.

7328
04:43:56,640 --> 04:43:57,700
I don't have soul link.

7329
04:43:59,240 --> 04:44:00,240
Two, two, two, two.

7330
04:44:01,120 --> 04:44:01,460
I got one.

7331
04:44:03,000 --> 04:44:03,920
Good job, good job.

7332
04:44:04,180 --> 04:44:05,040
Last fight, last fight.

7333
04:44:07,440 --> 04:44:07,760
Gotcha.

7334
04:44:08,040 --> 04:44:08,780
Nice job.

7335
04:44:10,780 --> 04:44:12,320
Very nice, very very nice.

7336
04:44:12,960 --> 04:44:14,260
They have storm ult.

7337
04:44:14,660 --> 04:44:16,160
They're changing, they're changing.

7338
04:44:16,300 --> 04:44:18,340
They're portaling, portaling.

7339
04:44:19,140 --> 04:44:19,980
I have ult up for this.

7340
04:44:20,440 --> 04:44:21,300
They're going to storm ult.

7341
04:44:21,640 --> 04:44:23,100
We have a free cone ult.

7342
04:44:23,920 --> 04:44:24,260
I have ult.

7343
04:44:26,580 --> 04:44:28,440
Holding point, holding point.

7344
04:44:29,140 --> 04:44:30,160
We have two ults soon.

7345
04:44:31,480 --> 04:44:32,500
Wait, he went main?

7346
04:44:32,720 --> 04:44:32,960
Wait, what?

7347
04:44:35,120 --> 04:44:35,960
Wait, magic, yeah?

7348
04:44:35,960 --> 04:44:36,660
Magic, yeah?

7349
04:44:37,820 --> 04:44:38,460
Wait, what?

7350
04:44:39,000 --> 04:44:40,680
Wait, that's like...

7351
04:44:40,680 --> 04:44:42,000
He canceled his TP.

7352
04:44:43,220 --> 04:44:45,240
There's no soul link.

7353
04:44:45,900 --> 04:44:46,820
There's no soul link.

7354
04:44:48,040 --> 04:44:49,540
It's okay, it's okay.

7355
04:44:50,060 --> 04:44:51,720
Nice, that's so good, that's so good.

7356
04:44:52,080 --> 04:44:52,620
Everybody's dead.

7357
04:44:53,400 --> 04:44:53,920
Yes, sir.

7358
04:44:55,120 --> 04:44:55,460
Nice.

7359
04:44:56,200 --> 04:44:56,920
Stop straight lining.

7360
04:45:00,240 --> 04:45:01,740
There's supposed to straight line.

7361
04:45:01,840 --> 04:45:02,300
I hate that.

7362
04:45:02,300 --> 04:45:02,720
Hahaha.

7363
04:45:04,900 --> 04:45:05,600
That's crazy.

7364
04:45:07,140 --> 04:45:08,180
They don't have portal.

7365
04:45:09,140 --> 04:45:10,520
I hate that map so much.

7366
04:45:11,000 --> 04:45:12,620
Okay, I'll still say Adam then.

7367
04:45:13,020 --> 04:45:14,220
Because we made it work in the end.

7368
04:45:16,800 --> 04:45:18,100
Alright, one more, one more.

7369
04:45:18,300 --> 04:45:20,420
I think I was able to heal properly at a better angle too.

7370
04:45:20,520 --> 04:45:22,320
It was like so much of a mess at the first part.

7371
04:45:22,620 --> 04:45:23,400
When we were grabbing point.

7372
04:45:24,900 --> 04:45:26,680
Okay, so they went, they did storm ult.

7373
04:45:26,760 --> 04:45:27,580
They should have less support.

7374
04:45:27,640 --> 04:45:28,660
They have a cloak ult.

7375
04:45:29,180 --> 04:45:30,140
They haven't used it at all.

7376
04:45:30,140 --> 04:45:32,040
Did they?

7377
04:45:32,780 --> 04:45:34,580
They used it in the fight before, so they might have it.

7378
04:45:34,580 --> 04:45:35,260
Yeah, they might have it here.

7379
04:45:36,020 --> 04:45:38,580
We could engage with the Psylocke ult.

7380
04:45:39,780 --> 04:45:40,780
And see if they do have...

7381
04:45:40,780 --> 04:45:42,920
Yeah, see if we do have support here.

7382
04:45:45,480 --> 04:45:46,540
We can put you...

7383
04:45:46,540 --> 04:45:48,640
What we can do is we can put you all the way in the right room.

7384
04:45:48,800 --> 04:45:49,200
On the high ground.

7385
04:45:49,860 --> 04:45:52,240
We can just all int in, and then you get your rez ready.

7386
04:45:52,360 --> 04:45:54,660
And then we can all get rezzed again.

7387
04:45:54,980 --> 04:45:56,180
Okay, I can do that.

7388
04:45:56,760 --> 04:45:57,800
I'll just go right then.

7389
04:45:57,800 --> 04:45:58,740
I'll go flank.

7390
04:46:02,040 --> 04:46:04,560
I'm going the right side, so don't follow me.

7391
04:46:06,980 --> 04:46:07,800
Alright, I'm as a loner.

7392
04:46:08,960 --> 04:46:09,540
Leave her alone.

7393
04:46:11,860 --> 04:46:12,380
Oh, I'm hit.

7394
04:46:12,680 --> 04:46:13,840
Are they on...

7395
04:46:14,880 --> 04:46:15,280
Magic...

7396
04:46:16,560 --> 04:46:17,360
Moon Knight...

7397
04:46:17,360 --> 04:46:18,560
Are they running the same thing?

7398
04:46:22,300 --> 04:46:23,580
Not the exact same thing.

7399
04:46:23,580 --> 04:46:23,980
Where's Namor?

7400
04:46:24,100 --> 04:46:24,540
They have Namor.

7401
04:46:24,540 --> 04:46:26,100
They have Namor now.

7402
04:46:26,340 --> 04:46:26,960
I'm one.

7403
04:46:27,280 --> 04:46:27,280
I'm one.

7404
04:46:27,300 --> 04:46:27,440
I'm one.

7405
04:46:28,520 --> 04:46:29,240
It's fine.

7406
04:46:30,940 --> 04:46:31,620
Got one.

7407
04:46:32,160 --> 04:46:33,500
I got the...

7408
04:46:34,780 --> 04:46:35,660
I'm on Sue.

7409
04:46:36,460 --> 04:46:37,160
I'm on Sue.

7410
04:46:39,020 --> 04:46:41,660
I'm killing you.

7411
04:46:41,780 --> 04:46:42,660
I got you.

7412
04:46:43,860 --> 04:46:44,740
I got you.

7413
04:46:44,900 --> 04:46:45,780
My damage doesn't matter.

7414
04:46:46,500 --> 04:46:46,740
We got Sue.

7415
04:46:46,840 --> 04:46:47,320
We got Sue.

7416
04:46:49,480 --> 04:46:50,820
Get the Namor.

7417
04:46:51,980 --> 04:46:52,660
He has no...

7418
04:46:52,660 --> 04:46:53,780
He has no...

7419
04:46:54,480 --> 04:46:55,240
Kill him!

7420
04:46:55,580 --> 04:46:57,480
Okay, I'm one.

7421
04:46:58,320 --> 04:46:58,940
Oh, wait.

7422
04:46:59,020 --> 04:47:00,080
You got bounced away.

7423
04:47:02,380 --> 04:47:03,600
I don't have snap.

7424
04:47:03,700 --> 04:47:04,100
I don't have snap.

7425
04:47:04,540 --> 04:47:04,920
I got it now.

7426
04:47:05,280 --> 04:47:05,720
I'm backing up.

7427
04:47:06,180 --> 04:47:06,540
Back up.

7428
04:47:06,620 --> 04:47:06,880
Back up.

7429
04:47:07,040 --> 04:47:07,220
Back up.

7430
04:47:07,480 --> 04:47:15,360
I can look for a massive ult here.

7431
04:47:16,180 --> 04:47:17,820
They should have thing ult, right?

7432
04:47:19,020 --> 04:47:19,440
Probably.

7433
04:47:19,760 --> 04:47:21,380
They should have Moon Knight too.

7434
04:47:21,380 --> 04:47:22,320
I ult here.

7435
04:47:22,440 --> 04:47:22,860
I ult here.

7436
04:47:22,960 --> 04:47:24,260
I just need Lime near me.

7437
04:47:24,320 --> 04:47:25,080
Okay, get Lime.

7438
04:47:26,720 --> 04:47:27,100
Nice.

7439
04:47:28,860 --> 04:47:29,500
Good pick.

7440
04:47:30,700 --> 04:47:31,680
Play around the corner here.

7441
04:47:32,080 --> 04:47:32,280
Nice.

7442
04:47:33,820 --> 04:47:35,500
Alright, if you want to 1v6, man.

7443
04:47:38,200 --> 04:47:39,740
I'm literally just standing here.

7444
04:47:43,480 --> 04:47:45,460
He died, came back, and killed you.

7445
04:47:45,620 --> 04:47:46,320
That's crazy.

7446
04:47:48,260 --> 04:47:49,160
Alright, we can look for a big ult here.

7447
04:47:49,160 --> 04:47:50,660
Do we look for it?

7448
04:47:51,860 --> 04:47:52,840
I'm kinda down to look for this.

7449
04:47:52,920 --> 04:47:53,740
3, 2, 1.

7450
04:47:53,780 --> 04:47:53,880
Big.

7451
04:47:54,080 --> 04:47:54,080
Big.

7452
04:47:54,260 --> 04:47:54,260
Big.

7453
04:47:54,300 --> 04:47:54,300
Big.

7454
04:47:54,340 --> 04:47:54,340
Big.

7455
04:47:57,580 --> 04:47:57,980
Nice.

7456
04:47:58,460 --> 04:47:58,580
Nice.

7457
04:47:59,540 --> 04:47:59,940
Yeah.

7458
04:48:01,160 --> 04:48:03,360
There's a magic behind you.

7459
04:48:03,360 --> 04:48:03,600
Magic.

7460
04:48:03,740 --> 04:48:03,800
Magic.

7461
04:48:03,940 --> 04:48:04,020
Magic.

7462
04:48:04,720 --> 04:48:05,520
Oh, I didn't see her.

7463
04:48:06,000 --> 04:48:07,380
You didn't see her?

7464
04:48:10,240 --> 04:48:11,960
I didn't even see her, bro.

7465
04:48:12,100 --> 04:48:13,000
That's all me, bro.

7466
04:48:13,200 --> 04:48:13,760
My bad.

7467
04:48:14,920 --> 04:48:16,640
Oh, I didn't see you.

7468
04:48:20,720 --> 04:48:21,680
Our child.

7469
04:48:22,140 --> 04:48:23,200
My bad, bro.

7470
04:48:23,400 --> 04:48:23,960
Am I inting?

7471
04:48:24,240 --> 04:48:25,140
Oh, I am.

7472
04:48:25,720 --> 04:48:26,040
Maybe.

7473
04:48:26,580 --> 04:48:26,660
Maybe.

7474
04:48:28,380 --> 04:48:31,360
I don't have Soul Bond anymore, so that's awesome.

7475
04:48:32,020 --> 04:48:32,660
Let me get in there.

7476
04:48:33,080 --> 04:48:33,940
I'm low.

7477
04:48:34,280 --> 04:48:34,280
I'm low.

7478
04:48:34,560 --> 04:48:35,000
I'm low.

7479
04:48:35,740 --> 04:48:36,640
I'm trying to heal.

7480
04:48:37,140 --> 04:48:37,740
I'm trying so hard.

7481
04:48:38,780 --> 04:48:40,240
Oh my god, it's Big Clubber.

7482
04:48:40,560 --> 04:48:42,040
Looks like a Big Clubber.

7483
04:48:42,500 --> 04:48:43,560
I couldn't do it.

7484
04:48:44,940 --> 04:48:45,940
That's so fucking good.

7485
04:48:47,880 --> 04:48:50,080
Why the fuck are you Spider-Man?

7486
04:48:51,920 --> 04:48:53,720
I'm Spider-Man.

7487
04:48:54,060 --> 04:48:54,120
Spider-Man.

7488
04:48:54,840 --> 04:48:56,340
I'm Spider-Man.

7489
04:48:57,200 --> 04:48:58,480
I'm really Spider-Man.

7490
04:48:59,060 --> 04:48:59,580
I'm really Spider-Man.

7491
04:48:59,580 --> 04:49:00,280
I'm really Spider-Man.

7492
04:49:01,400 --> 04:49:02,620
Oh, Spider-Man.

7493
04:49:03,900 --> 04:49:05,640
I'm going back.

7494
04:49:05,980 --> 04:49:06,600
I'm going back.

7495
04:49:07,560 --> 04:49:08,120
I'm done.

7496
04:49:09,240 --> 04:49:10,240
I think...

7497
04:49:10,240 --> 04:49:11,560
I think...

7498
04:49:11,560 --> 04:49:14,540
Who called Spider-Man?

7499
04:49:14,540 --> 04:49:16,000
Who fucking asked?

7500
04:49:16,780 --> 04:49:18,220
Who changed to Spider-Man?

7501
04:49:18,480 --> 04:49:19,160
I wonder.

7502
04:49:19,600 --> 04:49:21,140
Are we portaling or are we just going?

7503
04:49:21,340 --> 04:49:21,800
Yeah, we can portal.

7504
04:49:23,920 --> 04:49:25,040
Where do we portal to?

7505
04:49:26,820 --> 04:49:28,360
You know, we just have to do it on point.

7506
04:49:28,840 --> 04:49:29,560
I'll just do it on point.

7507
04:49:30,500 --> 04:49:31,760
We'll do the MMO thing.

7508
04:49:32,840 --> 04:49:33,340
Yeah, I'm good.

7509
04:49:33,740 --> 04:49:36,240
I'll do the MMO thing and then I'll do the usual.

7510
04:49:38,620 --> 04:49:39,340
I can look for Ola as well.

7511
04:49:41,760 --> 04:49:42,300
Counter Ola.

7512
04:49:42,300 --> 04:49:43,140
There.

7513
04:49:43,360 --> 04:49:45,160
Oh my god, it's massive.

7514
04:49:45,400 --> 04:49:46,360
It's everywhere.

7515
04:49:47,920 --> 04:49:48,620
I'm slapping Strange.

7516
04:49:48,980 --> 04:49:50,240
I'm body blocking Magic.

7517
04:49:51,140 --> 04:49:52,400
I can kill her.

7518
04:49:54,200 --> 04:49:55,100
No more!

7519
04:49:56,220 --> 04:49:56,800
Goodbye!

7520
04:49:59,620 --> 04:50:00,880
Goodbye, no more!

7521
04:50:03,000 --> 04:50:03,580
Nice.

7522
04:50:03,880 --> 04:50:04,360
Is he portaling?

7523
04:50:04,820 --> 04:50:06,200
There's no way he can do it in time.

7524
04:50:07,160 --> 04:50:09,480
Yeah, GG!

7525
04:50:09,480 --> 04:50:09,840
GG!

7526
04:50:10,560 --> 04:50:11,580
We did it!

7527
04:50:12,960 --> 04:50:14,160
We got it!

7528
04:50:14,500 --> 04:50:16,300
Are we done for today?

7529
04:50:16,420 --> 04:50:17,400
Yeah, we did it.

7530
04:50:18,580 --> 04:50:19,440
Thank god.

7531
04:50:19,980 --> 04:50:21,440
Thank god.

7532
04:50:23,840 --> 04:50:24,940
We should have.

7533
04:50:24,940 --> 04:50:26,060
Let me double check.

7534
04:50:26,720 --> 04:50:27,320
Let me check.

7535
04:50:27,840 --> 04:50:29,140
We're 9-1, right?

7536
04:50:29,440 --> 04:50:31,700
Yeah, we only had one tie, so we make it.

7537
04:50:33,260 --> 04:50:34,900
So we're automatic winners.

7538
04:50:36,240 --> 04:50:38,560
Because the second place team has two ties.

7539
04:50:39,860 --> 04:50:40,660
Hell yeah.

7540
04:50:42,420 --> 04:50:43,340
We did it.

7541
04:50:43,400 --> 04:50:45,220
I'm so proud of us, guys.

7542
04:50:45,520 --> 04:50:46,340
I'm proud of y'all.

7543
04:50:47,080 --> 04:50:49,420
Each game, we all get better and better.

7544
04:50:49,620 --> 04:50:50,020
Also good.

7545
04:50:50,280 --> 04:50:51,540
In this one comp we play.

7546
04:50:55,240 --> 04:50:56,340
Our very favorite comp.

7547
04:50:56,680 --> 04:50:58,240
We keep banning out everything else.

7548
04:50:58,280 --> 04:50:59,620
It's not our fault!

7549
04:50:59,940 --> 04:51:02,980
It's not our fault they target banned Gomez.

7550
04:51:02,980 --> 04:51:05,260
Yeah, I love that.

7551
04:51:05,260 --> 04:51:09,300
We could play like real comps if they didn't ban Starlord.

7552
04:51:11,260 --> 04:51:13,520
This is Starlord ban every game.

7553
04:51:15,220 --> 04:51:16,600
It's not our fault.

7554
04:51:17,520 --> 04:51:19,060
GG's though, I'm proud of us.

7555
04:51:19,820 --> 04:51:21,060
Good stuff, guys.

7556
04:51:21,340 --> 04:51:22,180
Yeah, GG's.

7557
04:51:22,260 --> 04:51:22,960
We all did really well.

7558
04:51:22,960 --> 04:51:23,740
Plus Battle too.

7559
04:51:23,860 --> 04:51:25,080
All of us did really, really well.

7560
04:51:25,080 --> 04:51:25,660
Plus Battle.

7561
04:51:26,100 --> 04:51:29,050
I think this comp we're playing is super...

7562
04:51:29,780 --> 04:51:32,400
We have to be really coordinated as a team to play this comp.

7563
04:51:32,660 --> 04:51:33,880
We're so...

7564
04:51:35,060 --> 04:51:36,580
Yeah, coordination here.

7565
04:51:38,080 --> 04:51:46,680
When he killed that one guy, then he came back from spawn just to kill him?

7566
04:51:47,360 --> 04:51:47,920
No, no, no.

7567
04:51:48,160 --> 04:51:49,200
I looked back.

7568
04:51:49,300 --> 04:51:50,040
I looked at Cocam.

7569
04:51:50,180 --> 04:51:51,320
I jumped into his shots.

7570
04:51:53,200 --> 04:51:55,380
That doesn't make you look better, Gomez.

7571
04:51:56,680 --> 04:51:57,820
He didn't even aim.

7572
04:51:57,820 --> 04:52:00,140
He looked at one direction in each shot.

7573
04:52:00,340 --> 04:52:01,120
And I died.

7574
04:52:02,840 --> 04:52:03,580
GG's, Battle.

7575
04:52:05,080 --> 04:52:06,440
Good Magneto, Battle.

7576
04:52:06,660 --> 04:52:08,480
You actually got the play of the game, Battle.

7577
04:52:08,920 --> 04:52:10,820
You guys did really great though.

7578
04:52:10,960 --> 04:52:11,720
You guys did really good.

7579
04:52:12,480 --> 04:52:13,840
Yeah, I'm proud of us.

7580
04:52:14,760 --> 04:52:17,740
Yeah, I'll see you guys at 8am, everybody.

7581
04:52:18,200 --> 04:52:18,520
Yeah, I'm proud of us.

7582
04:52:18,860 --> 04:52:20,800
Oh no, that's PST.

7583
04:52:21,020 --> 04:52:21,740
Yeah, PST.

7584
04:52:21,960 --> 04:52:23,160
I'll see you at 8am.

7585
04:52:24,320 --> 04:52:26,120
Y'all better be sleeping, bro.

7586
04:52:27,820 --> 04:52:29,580
Oh no, I'm definitely sleeping early today.

7587
04:52:30,660 --> 04:52:36,720
I'm gonna try and like, work until I'm fucking exhausted by the end of the day so I can actually sleep this time.

7588
04:52:38,420 --> 04:52:39,520
Alright, GG's.

7589
04:52:39,540 --> 04:52:40,920
It was great playing with you guys for day one.

7590
04:52:42,140 --> 04:52:43,420
See you guys tomorrow.

7591
04:52:44,980 --> 04:52:45,460
GG's.

7592
04:52:45,680 --> 04:52:46,900
Bye bye, guys.

7593
04:52:46,960 --> 04:52:47,520
Bye bye.

7594
04:52:49,980 --> 04:52:51,060
Oh my god!

7595
04:52:51,360 --> 04:52:52,500
We made it to winners!

7596
04:52:53,240 --> 04:52:54,220
I'm so happy!

7597
04:52:54,220 --> 04:53:02,760
I'm so happy that we all made it to winners with this scummy comp.

7598
04:53:04,780 --> 04:53:06,200
Yeah, we all did really well.

7599
04:53:06,260 --> 04:53:08,000
I'm really proud of our team, like I said.

7600
04:53:09,100 --> 04:53:12,380
We started from our first scrim to now.

7601
04:53:13,020 --> 04:53:15,100
We all did really really well.

7602
04:53:15,600 --> 04:53:17,060
And this is the most Adam I've played too.

7603
04:53:17,120 --> 04:53:18,520
In the scrims, we were playing Luna.

7604
04:53:18,860 --> 04:53:19,760
I was mostly playing Luna.

7605
04:53:19,900 --> 04:53:23,540
I think I would play Adam once every scrim.

7606
04:53:24,100 --> 04:53:28,880
So this is the most I've ever had to play Adam in a long time.

7607
04:53:29,000 --> 04:53:36,180
So I'm happy I was able to do the things I can do as Adam with the lack of practice.

7608
04:53:37,880 --> 04:53:40,740
So yeah, because Naimo and Shota they got practice.

7609
04:53:41,800 --> 04:53:45,280
We put more so, instead of Adam, we did Luna instead.

7610
04:53:45,600 --> 04:53:49,520
But we felt like Adam was better against the stronger teams.

7611
04:53:51,220 --> 04:53:53,120
But yeah, thank you everybody!

7612
04:53:53,480 --> 04:53:54,400
That was fun.

7613
04:53:54,720 --> 04:53:59,380
It started off like slow because I was tired as fuck, but I hit my second win.

7614
04:53:59,680 --> 04:54:03,860
And I'm really happy with how much we all improved.

7615
04:54:04,240 --> 04:54:05,780
Thank you for the raid, Feta!

7616
04:54:06,280 --> 04:54:07,320
Thank you!

7617
04:54:08,360 --> 04:54:18,780
But I am incredibly happy with how well everybody performed individually and as a team and all our comms and stuff like that.

7618
04:54:18,780 --> 04:54:20,680
I'm really proud of our team and everything.

7619
04:54:21,360 --> 04:54:26,620
And the shots that we were doing and what we came up with.

7620
04:54:26,760 --> 04:54:31,980
When we realized what we were doing wrong we figured things out instantly.

7621
04:54:32,220 --> 04:54:32,860
We got better.

7622
04:54:33,040 --> 04:54:34,500
You know what I mentioned?

7623
04:54:34,680 --> 04:54:36,340
Oh, we need to be more proactive in swaps.

7624
04:54:36,780 --> 04:54:51,220
We instantly became more proactive in swapping when things don't work so that we could hydrogen bomb our opponents so we could get like, you know, so we don't have to play losers brackets.

7625
04:54:52,160 --> 04:54:53,280
So I'm really proud.

7626
04:54:53,360 --> 04:54:56,520
I'm really proud of everybody on this team.

7627
04:54:56,820 --> 04:54:59,040
I'm super happy with how everyone was doing.

7628
04:54:59,540 --> 04:55:02,380
And everybody improved so fucking much.

7629
04:55:04,160 --> 04:55:12,500
Like, Beto used to be like, used to just play mag, but now he can play like a lot of different tanks and everything ever since our first scrim.

7630
04:55:12,500 --> 04:55:18,680
And you know, I just love the improvement that everyone had.

7631
04:55:18,820 --> 04:55:20,700
And like, Coney learning the thing as well.

7632
04:55:22,020 --> 04:55:28,860
And you know, Laimu and Shoto being able to flex to being able to flex to like different supports for us.

7633
04:55:28,920 --> 04:55:31,760
Because Laimu didn't have Adam as her hero pool.

7634
04:55:32,480 --> 04:55:37,940
And Shoto was supposed to be like the main of the DPS, but he was able to flex to Loki, which helped a lot as well.

7635
04:55:39,360 --> 04:55:41,900
And yeah, like Laimu literally learned Adam in two weeks.

7636
04:55:42,460 --> 04:55:43,700
And her Adam is insane.

7637
04:55:43,820 --> 04:55:46,080
Her Adam is really really good for like what we're dealing with.

7638
04:55:46,560 --> 04:55:50,600
The fact that we didn't have like that many scrims compared to like some of the teams.

7639
04:55:50,700 --> 04:55:52,660
Like some teams were scrimming like almost every day.

7640
04:55:53,440 --> 04:55:58,420
So I'm really happy like the progress we've did to be able to go into winner's bracket.

7641
04:55:58,580 --> 04:55:58,980
But yes!

7642
04:55:59,500 --> 04:55:59,840
Yeah!

7643
04:56:00,400 --> 04:56:01,240
Thank you everyone!

7644
04:56:01,900 --> 04:56:02,940
Thank you everybody!

7645
04:56:03,560 --> 04:56:05,760
And also the progress between Jay too.

7646
04:56:05,820 --> 04:56:08,920
We actually have like comps with Jay that we haven't even tried yet.

7647
04:56:09,260 --> 04:56:13,140
Because we didn't bump into an occasion where we have to try it.

7648
04:56:13,520 --> 04:56:16,480
So I'm really proud of everybody.

7649
04:56:17,020 --> 04:56:18,220
But I'll see you guys on day two!

7650
04:56:18,380 --> 04:56:19,100
Day two!

7651
04:56:19,300 --> 04:56:21,340
We have day two.

7652
04:56:21,520 --> 04:56:22,560
It's the winner's bracket.

7653
04:56:23,600 --> 04:56:25,740
I think it's around it's eliminate.

7654
04:56:25,860 --> 04:56:27,840
I don't know how many games we're playing for winner's bracket.

7655
04:56:28,480 --> 04:56:28,760
But

7656
04:56:32,140 --> 04:56:35,140
we are playing against group G I believe.

7657
04:56:35,260 --> 04:56:36,000
I think it's group G.

7658
04:56:36,060 --> 04:56:36,660
I don't fucking know.

7659
04:56:36,840 --> 04:56:40,940
I'm gonna research the team later after everybody's done with their games.

7660
04:56:41,060 --> 04:56:42,140
Yeah, it's gonna be same time guys.

7661
04:56:42,220 --> 04:56:43,560
It's gonna start at 8am PST.

7662
04:56:43,980 --> 04:56:45,240
So it's gonna be the same time.

7663
04:56:45,700 --> 04:56:46,380
But yes!

7664
04:56:46,480 --> 04:56:47,120
Thank you everyone!

7665
04:56:47,480 --> 04:56:48,360
Thank you all for watching!

7666
04:56:48,420 --> 04:56:50,760
I hope you guys enjoyed watching competitive Marble Rivals.

7667
04:56:51,040 --> 04:56:57,780
I'm so happy with how well we've done for our first for my first real tournament and how well my team did.

7668
04:56:58,240 --> 04:56:59,900
Thank you everybody for watching guys!

7669
04:57:00,680 --> 04:57:02,580
As always everyone, stay hydrated.

7670
04:57:02,860 --> 04:57:03,400
Posture check.

7671
04:57:03,640 --> 04:57:05,440
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7672
04:57:05,540 --> 04:57:09,200
And if you did that for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

7673
04:57:09,300 --> 04:57:10,300
I'm gonna rest my voice now.

7674
04:57:10,540 --> 04:57:16,900
I shot called a lot with our other... I co-IGL'd a lot and had to alt track and everything.

7675
04:57:17,340 --> 04:57:21,740
And like micro macro... help... micro macro so my voice is tired.

7676
04:57:22,060 --> 04:57:23,020
So I'll see you guys next time.

7677
04:57:23,180 --> 04:57:23,920
I'll see you guys tomorrow!

7678
04:57:24,180 --> 04:57:24,840
Bye guys!

7679
04:57:25,220 --> 04:57:25,620
Bye!

7680
04:57:28,200 --> 04:57:29,260
I'm trying to find my ending screen.

7681
04:57:29,300 --> 04:57:29,640
Okay there you go.

7682
04:57:29,720 --> 04:57:30,120
Bye!
