1
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,680
What's like the common factor out of all of us here?

2
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,240
Gamers?

3
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Yeah, but like what else?

4
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,140
What else do we all have in common?

5
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:01,940
Money?

6
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,460
But everybody has money in like some way or form.

7
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,840
Right.

8
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,140
So like that's not really a good comparison because that's like comparing us to chat.

9
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,420
Because we all have money.

10
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,360
But what makes us different from chat?

11
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,460
We're all like living, breathing.

12
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,620
Yeah, but chat's living and breathing.

13
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,920
Chat's living and breathing.

14
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,300
Yeah.

15
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,840
No, they're not.

16
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,680
Chat isn't real.

17
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,260
Oh shit, you're right.

18
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,440
Me and my zero viewers.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,580
What the?

20
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, but like what else?

21
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,360
Like don't you have something that we also have?

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,720
No.

23
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,600
Don't you?

24
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,880
Don't you?

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,500
We have different things.

26
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,260
We have different things.

27
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,740
What do you mean?

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,340
Don't you have that, you know, that...

29
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,800
particularly adamant like...

30
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
thing in your...

31
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,360
folders?

32
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,760
I don't think so.

33
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,380
Don't you mean like...

34
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,600
I'm getting gassed right now.

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,600
Don't you mean like, you know, you know, did you have like a VTuber model?

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,100
Share for?

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,540
That you streamed?

38
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,300
Like, oh really?

39
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,000
Can you chat like pull up like clips of you using that?

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,960
Unfortunately...

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,180
Unfortunately, it's not Tuesday, so...

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Oh, so you do have...

43
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,920
a...

44
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,960
VTuber model.

45
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,220
No, VTubers aren't real, so...

46
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,560
Then what's the Tuesday thing?

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,840
Yes, it's not Tuesday.

48
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,640
Yeah, but what is the Tuesday thing?

49
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
If VTubers aren't real?

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,980
I don't know.

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
What is it?

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,620
What...

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,720
Can you please elaborate?

54
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,840
What happens when Tuesday stays on Tuesday?

55
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,860
What happens when Tuesday stays on Tuesday?

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,140
So if I ask you again on Tuesday, will you tell me what... would you say what it is?

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,980
No, I'd say, fuck you, bitch.

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,880
Also, anyway, I'm live now as well.

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,180
Are you live as well?

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,580
Share for?

61
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,120
Yeah.

62
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,660
Okay.

63
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm live as fuck.

64
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,980
Alright, so hello everybody!

65
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,280
Welcome to the Party Animals Twitch Rivals team!

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,540
We went straight into it with no introduction whatsoever.

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,960
Yippee!

68
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,860
Just like how...

69
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,540
We do our Twitch Rivals.

70
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,800
Anyway, this is my team.

71
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,520
Ditto, Surefour, and Bree.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,500
Um, I honestly thought that like...

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,900
Some of them had Party Animals experience, as in like a lot of Party Animals experience.

74
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,140
That's why I recruited...

75
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,780
I have 7.3 hours.

76
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,880
7.3?

77
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,100
Did you do several tournaments?

78
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,560
You did like two Twitch Rivals tournaments.

79
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,660
No, not Twitch Rivals.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,220
But you did two, like, Party Animals tournaments.

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,640
How much did you guys do?

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm on the stock.

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,860
How... What did you guys do?

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,620
Team threw.

85
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,400
Oh.

86
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,820
It's teams.

87
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,380
Fuck.

88
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,040
So what's your placement?

89
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,060
I don't remember.

90
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,400
All I remember is the Murder Crumpets team had a mute that like played the game 24-7.

91
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,800
What the fuck?

92
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,540
They soloed the team.

93
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,880
They soloed... They like destroyed... So they destroyed... You got destroyed by a mute?

94
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,680
I didn't get destroyed.

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,640
You got... But you said destroyed the team.

96
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,800
Yeah, it's a team game.

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,560
Yeah, but so you're part of the team.

98
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,060
So you got destroyed.

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,560
Yeah, I lost with the team.

100
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah, so you got destroyed.

101
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,540
So you're not a god gamer.

102
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,100
Well, you know, there's percentages.

103
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,360
There's percentages.

104
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,680
Like, of effort in the team.

105
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,520
And what's your percentage?

106
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,460
I'm like 90.

107
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,760
You're like... Oh, you're 90% of the team.

108
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,200
Yeah.

109
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,480
So the mute destroyed 90% of the team.

110
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,380
Okay.

111
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm so lost.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,640
Yeah.

113
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,100
Yeah.

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,500
But if you're 90% of the team and the mute destroyed your team, you got destroyed by the mute.

115
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,520
Okay, listen.

116
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,360
I was like 60% of the team.

117
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,700
I was like 60 to 80 in the PAL world team.

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,840
Dude, I don't wanna be hearing this.

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,420
What do you mean?

120
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,920
In PAL world, we all did an equal contribution to the team.

121
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,740
I quote, sure for you have to carry us.

122
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,300
You're the carry.

123
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,960
Yeah, and you died to a fucking bug.

124
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,900
I can't... That can't be controlled.

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,540
All I'm saying is, if you didn't die to that bug, we could have got third place.

126
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah, well, maybe if you made me more pokeballs.

127
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,400
Oh yeah.

128
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,140
We made you a collection of pokeballs.

129
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,880
What do you mean?

130
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,380
I needed more of a collection.

131
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,580
You did not need... You did... It was not the PAL balls.

132
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,040
That was the issue here.

133
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,200
It was.

134
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,040
I had to clutch out with like minimum power balls.

135
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,780
I'd be Glorp'ing my shit bro.

136
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,100
Oh my god.

137
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,880
You what?

138
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,600
He was Glorp'ing his shit.

139
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,940
Oh okay yeah I just wanted to make sure I heard correctly.

140
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,320
Thank you.

141
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,560
You know Glorp?

142
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,360
Glorpnorphin?

143
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,280
No.

144
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah Glorp.

145
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,860
It's a little cat.

146
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,820
It's a little green cat with antennas.

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,420
Oh you're talking about the cast?

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
Thinking about that Spongebob rapper.

149
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,340
No I'm talking about Glorp.

150
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,120
Glorp?

151
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,300
What the fuck is Glorp?

152
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,020
There's Glorp.

153
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,820
Oh my god wait he's so cute!

154
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,600
Yeah he's Glorp'ing.

155
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,500
Oh.

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,360
Yeah he's Glorp if that makes sense.

157
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:36,640
Yeah.

158
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,400
There's you'll Lorp.

159
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,920
And there's... or Lorp.

160
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,900
Basically there's a color for every orb.

161
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,180
There's a color for every orb?

162
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,500
Wait what are the orbs?

163
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,920
Well there's like Glorp and that's blue.

164
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,660
And then what?

165
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,240
Lorp?

166
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,340
I have to look.

167
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,060
You have to look?

168
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,220
You don't know them by heart?

169
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,680
No I only have Glorp.

170
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,360
Glorp looks like a Neopet.

171
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,980
I love him.

172
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,220
Glorp.

173
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,020
Cat.

174
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,340
Basically the beginning letter is the color.

175
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,080
Oh!

176
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,120
Glorp is Glorp because it's green.

177
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,240
Is there Yorp?

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,480
Yorp?

179
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,120
There's no Yorp.

180
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
There's no yellow.

181
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,800
There's no yellow cat.

182
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:20,920
There's no yellow cat.

183
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,720
There's Blorp.

184
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,180
Is there Blorp?

185
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:23,560
There is a yellow one.

186
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,460
No there isn't.

187
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:24,940
There's Blorp.

188
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,340
I don't see any.

189
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,600
I think this is a myth.

190
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,560
I think only Glorp.

191
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:32,940
No.

192
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,300
It's real.

193
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,480
I only see Glorp.

194
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,780
There's no proof.

195
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,080
You only see what you want to see.

196
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,020
Wait then where the fuck is Yorp?

197
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,940
Where's Yorp?

198
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,540
I'm looking for him.

199
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,300
I'm looking for him.

200
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,400
Yeah you can't find him.

201
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,280
No I can.

202
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,460
Where's Yorp?

203
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,920
Yeah he's gaslighting.

204
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,260
No I'm not.

205
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,410
Yeah I found him.

206
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,370
Here's Yalorp.

207
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,370
Where is it?

208
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,930
Posted in a team 3 chat.

209
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,030
My team 3 team don't give a fuck.

210
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,550
There we go.

211
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,090
I'm on it.

212
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,530
Wait there is Yorp!

213
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,090
Oh my god!

214
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,850
Wait how did you find Yorp?

215
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,390
My chat helped me.

216
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,350
Oh so you didn't do any of the work.

217
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,870
I got helpers.

218
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,750
So you didn't do any of the work.

219
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,630
Have you ever heard of a community?

220
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,670
Wait I thought chat wasn't real.

221
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,430
How are they helping you if chat isn't real?

222
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,230
You know like schizophrenics where they have voices in their head?

223
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,890
So the voices in your head help you.

224
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,250
Oh we're getting pinged for stuff now.

225
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:44,990
Okay nice.

226
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,550
Who are we?

227
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,450
It's match time.

228
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,730
It's time to find the lobby.

229
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,690
Please be careful.

230
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,790
Does this hide the code when we join it?

231
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,990
I have no idea.

232
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,910
I'm gonna fucking hide my game screen first.

233
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,570
Oh I joined a random game.

234
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,330
Okay custom game.

235
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,470
Custom game.

236
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,510
And then you search it up.

237
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,750
Okay.

238
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,410
Search.

239
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,410
What time is it over there for you?

240
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:11,970
Ditto.

241
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,810
Ditto what time is it?

242
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,850
10.

243
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,290
Oh it's 4 am.

244
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,710
Oh no.

245
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,790
She's locked in.

246
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,430
You usually sleep.

247
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,430
I can find it Bobby.

248
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,270
Maybe it's not up yet.

249
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,190
Oh no it's up.

250
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,630
I'm in it.

251
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:28,970
Oh I can see it.

252
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,650
I will join Dorky then.

253
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,830
Yeah join me.

254
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,610
I'm in.

255
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,050
Also it does show the code.

256
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,710
Oh Dorky you're in an online.

257
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,090
Oh I'll invite you in.

258
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,970
Let me see.

259
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,350
Okay.

260
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,710
Let's see where are you?

261
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,790
Oh I can't wait.

262
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,850
Give me a sec, let me see if I can invite you.

263
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,410
Oh, my friend.

264
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,090
Oh, I need to like, I need to add you in this...

265
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,030
Oh wait, no, I got you.

266
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,070
Okay, I sent you in.

267
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,350
Did you get it?

268
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,190
Are you Pussy Slayer?

269
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,510
Yeah.

270
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,410
Is that Pussy Slayer?

271
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:04,830
Yeah.

272
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,050
He's Pussy Slayer, but...

273
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,690
Oh my god, I'm not!

274
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,170
Alright, he's here to...

275
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,750
He's here to slay some cats!

276
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,150
I'm not thinking I'd be in Twitch Rivals.

277
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,090
It's okay, we're so locked in.

278
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,790
I was watching Drops Team fucking scrimming...

279
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,510
They were scrimming party animals.

280
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,870
For like two weeks.

281
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,770
Two to three weeks.

282
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,550
Why didn't you set up scrims?

283
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,510
Why did I not set up scrims?

284
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,190
Would you actually join scrims?

285
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,270
If I set it up?

286
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,730
Would you actually join scrims?

287
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,450
Would you do those, Surefour?

288
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:45,810
Hehe.

289
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,950
Yeah, I'll take that as a fucking no.

290
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,670
I'm always down for scrims.

291
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,270
Yeah, I don't think you would fucking scrim party animals.

292
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,530
Yeah, I was watching fucking Drops with the full-on Apex roster...

293
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,070
Scrimming party animals and hard-comming.

294
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,510
It was actually crazy.

295
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,190
I was like, oh, I'm gonna go to the Apex.

296
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,850
Apex players are sweats.

297
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,090
Wait, what's the comparison between...

298
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,590
What about like Apex versus Overwatch?

299
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,290
Who's sweatier?

300
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,530
Apex?

301
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,050
I think...

302
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,670
I think Overwatch tries to be sweatier, but it just comes across more depressing.

303
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,290
Oh shit, is that true?

304
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,470
I don't talk to Overwatch anymore.

305
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,150
As an Overwatch player, I use Sweat.

306
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:31,690
Yeah.

307
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,650
We've gone through enough one tricks that never swap that we just become complacent with everything.

308
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,650
That's so true.

309
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,670
That's so true.

310
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,890
I'm so sorry.

311
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,790
I was the one trick, so you know...

312
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:44,830
Oh, ew.

313
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,790
You were the problem.

314
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:47,950
I was...

315
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,270
I was a Mercy main.

316
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,350
And I was a D.Va main.

317
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,690
Oh, you were part of the problem.

318
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,550
You were 100%.

319
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,510
I would've avoided you.

320
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,570
I would've avoided you and reported you.

321
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,230
Oh no.

322
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,770
Oh no, no, no.

323
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,890
Oh no, no, no.

324
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,410
Do you know what the game mode is?

325
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,750
It's Lollipop Factory.

326
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,850
Lollipop...

327
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,090
Yeah.

328
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,450
Yeah.

329
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:09,750
Okay.

330
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,770
So what are you...

331
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,270
I just know.

332
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,890
You collect it.

333
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,550
You have to like...

334
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,070
Yeah.

335
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,970
And then you have to move it to like a little tray and then you have to pull the lever to put the tray in.

336
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,730
And then there's like a big gummy bear that's worth like way more.

337
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:20,610
Yeah.

338
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,390
I'm just gonna be beating the shit out of them.

339
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,130
Okay.

340
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,470
Okay.

341
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,050
So like what's the strat for this?

342
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,310
I remember when I tried to play this and I got absolutely destroyed.

343
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,230
You have people trying to stop them from putting in candy and then you have people on your team putting the candy.

344
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,550
And I'm gonna be interference.

345
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,670
Okay.

346
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,910
I'm just gonna be beating the shit.

347
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,650
Okay.

348
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,130
Okay.

349
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,570
I'll...

350
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,230
I'll help bring candy over.

351
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:41,870
Okay.

352
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,750
You gotta protect me.

353
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,650
You know and I will bring candy over.

354
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,710
I don't know what Bri is gonna do.

355
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,570
Okay.

356
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,090
Okay.

357
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,230
Oh.

358
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,290
I will...

359
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,470
I will beat people up.

360
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,110
Okay.

361
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,730
Are you good at beating people up?

362
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,230
Yes.

363
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,130
Okay.

364
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,490
Okay.

365
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,870
And you're not lying... lying to me like how you lied earlier, right?

366
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,390
I would never.

367
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:58,690
Okay.

368
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,250
I will protect you.

369
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,010
I'm indiscriminate in my beating.

370
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:05,810
Alright.

371
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:06,890
Wait.

372
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,110
No.

373
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,150
You're not supposed to beat us up.

374
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,170
You're part of the team.

375
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:09,950
Yeah.

376
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,230
Wait.

377
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,510
You guys are caught in the crossfire.

378
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,510
There's nothing I can do about it.

379
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:14,970
Then we lose.

380
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,210
You know what?

381
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,590
That's fair.

382
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,630
I thought you want to win.

383
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,430
Hey, listen.

384
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,330
If I have the lollipop stick...

385
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,790
This is party animals.

386
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,610
This is serious.

387
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,270
This is...

388
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,530
We just...

389
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:23,990
There's AOE.

390
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,670
You got to take it serious.

391
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:25,950
I'm serious.

392
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,410
But you're a gamer.

393
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,050
You should have...

394
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,230
That's why I'm saying.

395
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,150
I'm probably...

396
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,590
I'm forewarning at the beginning.

397
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,710
But you're a gamer.

398
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,030
You should be able to like, control the beatings.

399
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,450
No.

400
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:35,670
Listen.

401
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,510
I can't control the actions of my teammates.

402
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,210
I can only control myself.

403
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:41,870
I don't want to be a part of it.

404
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:47,770
I'm ready.

405
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,890
Yorp is just on my screen.

406
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,050
Oh, I'm ready.

407
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,730
Yorp Norpin?

408
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,110
Yeah, he's just Yorping.

409
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,570
Alright, here we go.

410
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,790
I believe in us.

411
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,690
We're so ready.

412
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,410
No, we got this.

413
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,050
We're so ready.

414
00:14:59,190 --> 00:14:59,670
It's okay.

415
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,250
Oh yeah, we're gonna win.

416
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,410
Alright.

417
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:02,930
Where am I?

418
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,790
Okay, here I am.

419
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,630
What you think, Yorp?

420
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,590
We have to go grab the candy!

421
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:06,970
The candy!

422
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,450
Let's go!

423
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:07,790
Let's go!

424
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,010
Let's go!

425
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,650
Beat him up, Trevor!

426
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,330
Beat him up, Bri!

427
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,910
I got a taser.

428
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,210
Okay!

429
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,070
Oh, they're going for the big one!

430
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,530
Oh my god.

431
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,110
I'm trying to pull... get the little ones.

432
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,750
Somebody beat up the big ones while I grab the little ones!

433
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,430
I'm grabbing it.

434
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:22,630
I'm hitting with the taser.

435
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,070
Wait, where's the...

436
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,010
Oh, they're getting the big one!

437
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,190
I'm punching them.

438
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,130
Okay.

439
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,150
Wait, where's the guys?

440
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,890
They're getting the big one?

441
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,090
I'm going.

442
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,670
I'm going.

443
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,210
Guys, I actually don't remember where the... where the...

444
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:34,490
The what?

445
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,710
Where is our area?

446
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,310
Oh, there it is.

447
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,770
We're red.

448
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,510
We're red.

449
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,230
Okay.

450
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,110
Take the candy!

451
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,310
Okay, I'm grabbing...

452
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,450
I'm grabbing the mini candies.

453
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,490
Don't worry, guys.

454
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,210
I got it.

455
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,470
Nice.

456
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:47,750
No!

457
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,590
It's okay.

458
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,470
Oh, he got the big one.

459
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,230
Pull it!

460
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,310
Pull it!

461
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,110
Wait, we got the big one?

462
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,010
He got it!

463
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,350
I got it!

464
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,030
I got the big one.

465
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,010
Nice.

466
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,530
Am I...

467
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,550
Oh, I can't pull it!

468
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,050
It can't be!

469
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,770
Guys, help!

470
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,190
It got me!

471
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,430
I can't pull it!

472
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,350
Somebody help me!

473
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,350
He's fucking punching me!

474
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,810
I need somebody to help me pull it!

475
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,990
I got it!

476
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,190
I got it!

477
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:11,330
I got it!

478
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,790
I got it!

479
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,210
I got it!

480
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,730
Nice work!

481
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:14,730
Big?

482
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,570
I've been punching the shit out of them over here.

483
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,550
Just keep getting the big one and we win.

484
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:19,790
Okay.

485
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:20,450
Okay.

486
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,590
I had trouble fucking...

487
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,570
Okay, I need somebody to help me.

488
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,610
I need help!

489
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,250
I need help!

490
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,790
Yes!

491
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,970
How do I get this down?

492
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,670
Wait, I don't think...

493
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,810
You have to go the long way.

494
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,850
You have to go the long way.

495
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,870
You can't do it from the...

496
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,870
Up the ramp!

497
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,650
Guys, help me!

498
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,150
Liam's trying to pee pee!

499
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:41,950
Liam's trying to pee pee pee!

500
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,830
Liam's got me!

501
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,370
No, Liam!

502
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,830
I'm grabbing the small, one.

503
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,970
You guys go do your thing.

504
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,610
You guys go do your thing.

505
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,490
I'm grabbing the small one too.

506
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,850
You guys go do your thing.

507
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,730
You guys don't tip me!

508
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,010
You guys don't tip me!

509
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,910
I'm slowly handing over...

510
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,470
Oh, he's got the pan.

511
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,010
Oh no!

512
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,790
Liam!

513
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,330
Get off of me!

514
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,270
I'm here!

515
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,030
They're getting the big one!

516
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,610
We need to stop everyone getting the big one!

517
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,550
Okay, somebody fell in there.

518
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,050
I don't know who it was.

519
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,810
Guys, we need help.

520
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,890
They're about to get the big one!

521
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,950
I hope you guys are doing it!

522
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:23,850
I don't know how to play this game.

523
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,770
If you can just keep getting the small ones, it's fine.

524
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,930
We got them trapped in here.

525
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,790
No, don't, please!

526
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,630
I'm just a little dog!

527
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,350
I'm getting the small ones.

528
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,350
Please!

529
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,570
No!

530
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,250
Go, leave!

531
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,230
Run, run, Ditto!

532
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,970
He's on me!

533
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,290
Okay, okay, okay.

534
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:41,790
I'm running.

535
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,530
Nice, nice.

536
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,630
I got it!

537
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,470
I'm just going!

538
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,850
They're bad?

539
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,190
Oh, you stole the big one?

540
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,010
Nice, nice.

541
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,230
Okay.

542
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,410
I'm getting crushed!

543
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,890
I got three of them down right here.

544
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,710
If you could steal it.

545
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,750
It's okay.

546
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,350
I'm getting out.

547
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,590
Just keep grabbing.

548
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,950
He's too busy on me!

549
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,750
He's too busy on me!

550
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,270
I got him.

551
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,210
I got him sunlocked.

552
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,250
Oh my god!

553
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,350
It's okay!

554
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,130
I go put this on here.

555
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,610
I'm coming!

556
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,910
I'm coming!

557
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,370
It's so lucky!

558
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,990
I can get the lever!

559
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,270
It's so lucky!

560
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,050
I can get the lever!

561
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,750
I got the big one!

562
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,390
Oh!

563
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,730
Oh my god!

564
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,630
We win!

565
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:19,990
We win!

566
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,250
We win!

567
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:20,970
Yeah!

568
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,830
Guys, I used the cooldown.

569
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,750
I used the cooldown.

570
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,270
I used the cooldown for a small one.

571
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:26,790
I didn't realize.

572
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:26,990
Just play it.

573
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:27,970
Pull the trigger.

574
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,170
Pull the trigger!

575
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,410
I'm trying!

576
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,970
I'm trying!

577
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,890
I can't do well and I'm panicking!

578
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,330
I'm a diiiiiing!

579
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:37,910
Yippee!

580
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,910
We did

581
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,100
it!

582
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,620
Line of my resume bias!

583
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,740
Okay, sure.

584
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,660
But how much did Brie actually help?

585
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,120
I got pulled so many times.

586
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,540
They clutched out by stealing it while I was just fucking perma-knocking three of them on the ground.

587
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,320
Guys!

588
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,330
Yay!

589
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,110
Come on!

590
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,610
Do we do it again?

591
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,610
I don't know.

592
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,210
I thought it was only one.

593
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,550
Best of three?

594
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,550
Best of three?

595
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,070
Is it again?

596
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,010
Do we have to go through it again?

597
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,310
No, game two is buzzball.

598
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,010
Oh, I know buzzball.

599
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,850
What is buzzball?

600
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,270
Do we do it?

601
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:32,370
What?

602
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,610
That's the one where... I don't know.

603
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,350
Let's just play until something happens.

604
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,050
Yeah, let's just play until something happens.

605
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,550
Yeah, they're going for it!

606
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,270
They're going for it!

607
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,590
I'm going for the little ones.

608
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,010
Fuck this.

609
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,570
You guys can deal with that.

610
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,450
I know my place.

611
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,310
Punch him!

612
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,890
Punch him!

613
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,370
Nice!

614
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:57,430
Yippee!

615
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,970
Yay!

616
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:06,910
Okay, I'm pretty sure buzzball is the one where there's a ball and you have to throw it in the goal and if you hold it too long it explodes.

617
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,270
Oh, okay.

618
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,430
Oh, yeah.

619
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,230
It's like soccer.

620
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:13,890
Okay, I get it.

621
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,710
Yay!

622
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,810
I got a cow!

623
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,970
Got the avatar.

624
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,610
How do you clean?

625
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,430
I'm glad we're unlocking characters that we get for playing the game once.

626
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,910
It's okay.

627
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,850
I believe in... You know what?

628
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,670
After that first game, you know what?

629
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,610
I believe in us.

630
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,170
I didn't believe in us before we started, but now I believe in us.

631
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:46,590
Well, this one... If you get into that little thing at the end and you just press right click, it usually gets thrown in.

632
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,110
Okay.

633
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,690
Boom.

634
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,230
I'm using controller, so what's right click?

635
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,390
On the controller.

636
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:52,670
Oh.

637
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,210
I don't know.

638
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,330
I use keyboard and mouse.

639
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,370
Whatever your throw is.

640
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,470
If two people hold onto the ball, it explodes.

641
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,310
Oh, okay.

642
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,330
So we shouldn't hold...

643
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:05,470
Okay.

644
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,270
Well, you can.

645
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,350
Sometimes it's clutch.

646
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,930
I got it!

647
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,810
You got it!

648
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,130
You got it!

649
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:10,610
Right click it!

650
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:10,870
Yay!

651
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:17,190
You just locked up and just fucking...

652
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,450
What?

653
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,670
What the hell just happened?

654
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,490
I did it!

655
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,030
So that's the throw button.

656
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,930
That's easy as...

657
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,110
No!

658
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,110
Oh, god.

659
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,330
Okay.

660
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,630
Alright.

661
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,910
Go!

662
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,350
Go!

663
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,610
Go!

664
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,590
Okay.

665
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,050
I knocked two.

666
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,850
You got it!

667
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,470
No!

668
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,170
No, no, no!

669
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,890
No, you got it!

670
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,910
Someone punched me out.

671
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,650
It wasn't me, I swear.

672
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,570
Oh, I know.

673
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,930
It was an enemy.

674
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:49,490
OH!

675
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,510
And the bats got it!

676
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,150
The bats got it!

677
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,470
I got knocked out.

678
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,010
No!

679
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,550
Punch it!

680
00:21:59,570 --> 00:21:59,710
Punch it!

681
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,230
It's not fine!

682
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,990
Just hold on to it.

683
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,450
That's fine, that's fine.

684
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,510
No, it's not fine!

685
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,950
No!

686
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,750
It was in the end not fine.

687
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,450
We got the bad RNG.

688
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,230
I was hoping it would go to their side.

689
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,890
I hear you.

690
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,750
This time we got it.

691
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,130
I believe in us team.

692
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,050
Oh no.

693
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,870
Oh my god.

694
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,110
That's you.

695
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,850
Nice throw.

696
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,010
Come on, go pussy slayer!

697
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,210
No, pussy slayer!

698
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,170
I got knocked out.

699
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,250
I got knocked out too!

700
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,730
No, it was splinter!

701
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,570
No!

702
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,790
Splinter!

703
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,770
Okay, guys.

704
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,730
Now I don't have confidence anymore.

705
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,410
We're only down one.

706
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,490
It's like that's so fair.

707
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,030
Okay, I'll just run and grab it.

708
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:04,530
It's sixth.

709
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,410
It's sixth.

710
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,370
I'm trying to grab him.

711
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,030
Oh, I grabbed him instead.

712
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,270
You got it, you got it!

713
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,450
Oh my god, it won't let me!

714
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,870
Okay, I'm just running again.

715
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,570
I'm just running.

716
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:18,870
No!

717
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,930
Please have mercy.

718
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,150
No!

719
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,610
No, he knocked me out before I could get there!

720
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,450
I got knocked out!

721
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,630
Alright, winnable.

722
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,090
No!

723
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,250
I got knocked out!

724
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,850
Knocked out again!

725
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,110
It's up to you, pussy slayer!

726
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,350
I can't hit him!

727
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,090
Nice.

728
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,690
Nice pass.

729
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,750
Oh, I knocked him out.

730
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,430
Get it, get it.

731
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,330
I got it.

732
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,410
Throw it in.

733
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,630
Yes!

734
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,350
Woo!

735
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,050
Yay!

736
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,890
Now we're tied.

737
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,250
We did it.

738
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,330
We're doing it, guys!

739
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,610
We're doing it!

740
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:00,770
See?

741
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,490
Winnable.

742
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,050
It is!

743
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,410
Oh my god, it is winnable!

744
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,210
Winnable.

745
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,430
Who would've thought?

746
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,990
I got knocked out.

747
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,550
Oh, I got knocked out.

748
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,210
Oh my!

749
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,070
Oh god.

750
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,290
It's fine.

751
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,250
It's fine.

752
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,990
Get over here!

753
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,270
Okay.

754
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,710
I got him.

755
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,530
You're holding onto me!

756
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,170
Oh, I'm so sorry.

757
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:24,950
Okay.

758
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,530
Oh, nice throw!

759
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,630
Nice throw.

760
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,830
Yeah, but he's heading over.

761
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:30,590
It's fine.

762
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,450
We got it near their goal.

763
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,230
Oh no!

764
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,990
He punched it away!

765
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,830
It's not near our goal anymore!

766
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,570
I'll wait for you.

767
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,210
I'll wait for the throw.

768
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,750
I'll wait for the throw.

769
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,730
Oh god.

770
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,170
Oh god.

771
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:40,370
Wait.

772
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:40,890
I'm knocked out.

773
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,230
Oh, big knockout!

774
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,390
Big knockout.

775
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,010
Big knockout.

776
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:45,850
I'm going over.

777
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,550
We'll throw it if you need to.

778
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,930
You got it!

779
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,650
Go, go, go!

780
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,190
We got it!

781
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,490
We got it!

782
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,830
We got it!

783
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,070
Yes!

784
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,590
Yes!

785
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:51,870
Yay!

786
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,410
Yay!

787
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,850
Only three more to go.

788
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,150
Oh my god.

789
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,270
It's not winnable.

790
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,330
Yeah.

791
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,270
Is it?

792
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,910
Pussy slayer with the goal.

793
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,370
Pussy slayer goal!

794
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,210
Got it.

795
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,590
Wait a minute.

796
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,030
Oh, nice.

797
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:15,830
Chipped!

798
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,690
Chipped!

799
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,030
Let's go!

800
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,910
I don't need practice.

801
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,550
Look at us.

802
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,270
Just do that every single time.

803
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,870
Just run it down mid every single time.

804
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,450
Just run it down!

805
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,270
I knew Tyler1 was right in some ways.

806
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,290
My philosophy.

807
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,230
Run it down.

808
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:37,910
Okay, never mind.

809
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:38,330
I'm out.

810
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,690
Oh no.

811
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,050
Oh no.

812
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,170
It's fine.

813
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:41,610
He fucked up.

814
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:41,970
He fucked up.

815
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,050
Oh no.

816
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:44,410
Oh no!

817
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,410
He didn't fuck up!

818
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,090
You liar!

819
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,210
This will make the comeback better.

820
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:50,630
It's fine.

821
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,910
Instead of punching him, I just need to grab him.

822
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,130
Because the punch was missing.

823
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,050
Yeah, that's not good.

824
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,350
I just grabbed someone and I dragged him away.

825
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,970
I just grabbed someone and I dragged him away.

826
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,110
Okay.

827
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,850
Run it down mid.

828
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,590
Run it down mid and then I'll fucking do this.

829
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:07,990
Let's go.

830
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,070
Let's go.

831
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,090
No, no, I'm out.

832
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,490
I'm out.

833
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:09,690
No!

834
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,010
I'm out.

835
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,730
You got me.

836
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,190
I'm out forever.

837
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,770
I missed everything.

838
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,610
No, I missed everything!

839
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,790
Oh, he fucked up.

840
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,270
He fucked up.

841
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,670
Oh no!

842
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,630
He didn't fuck up yet!

843
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,730
Oh!

844
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,910
Okay, I'm waiting.

845
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm waiting.

846
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:25,610
I'm waiting.

847
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:25,990
I'm waiting.

848
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,490
Oh, I'm waiting.

849
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,970
I'm waiting.

850
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,890
I'm right here waiting for you.

851
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:30,610
Nice!

852
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:30,910
Nice!

853
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,550
Nice!

854
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,450
Nice!

855
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:34,530
Nice!

856
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,570
Oh my god.

857
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,470
Is this the next Messi right there?

858
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,350
Leon, no!

859
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,410
Goal!

860
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,370
Those moves!

861
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,350
Hey.

862
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,790
Alright, this is the last one.

863
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,250
Easy.

864
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,630
Come on.

865
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:52,570
Woah.

866
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:52,950
Woah.

867
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,130
Woah.

868
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,210
Woah.

869
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,770
You got this.

870
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,170
You got this.

871
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,390
I couldn't think you went in for me.

872
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,930
Oh god.

873
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,610
Oh no.

874
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,310
Oh no.

875
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,530
I'm waiting for you guys.

876
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,090
Knock the fuck out.

877
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,190
Oh, oh.

878
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,010
She needs help.

879
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:06,490
Do you need help?

880
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,050
Do you need help?

881
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,130
Oh, I got it.

882
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,470
I got it.

883
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:08,870
Good.

884
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,210
Good.

885
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,390
Good.

886
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,070
I got it.

887
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:10,310
I got it.

888
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,730
I got it.

889
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,070
Oh, they're fucking... They're harassing me.

890
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,230
But I got it.

891
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,280
We won!

892
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,340
Oh my god.

893
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,100
Three people can't stop me!

894
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,160
That was four people.

895
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,980
Oh shit.

896
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,440
You're right.

897
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,510
Who needs to scrim?

898
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,520
We're just naturally talented.

899
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,360
What makes me gonna win?

900
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,060
Oh shit.

901
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm out.

902
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,900
I can't even.

903
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,200
Oh wait.

904
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,620
No, they beat the photo.

905
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,100
I'm a winner.

906
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm a winner.

907
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,440
Oh yeah!

908
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,540
Oh yeah!

909
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,180
Yay!

910
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:55,680
Yay!

911
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,160
Is that automatically a win for us?

912
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,320
We don't have to play the third round, right?

913
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,540
Yeah, we won.

914
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,820
We won.

915
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,580
Oh my god.

916
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,360
What a speedrun.

917
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,420
Speedrun.

918
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,940
Alright, the next round two is Luggage Chaos, Beast Soccer, and Winter is Coming.

919
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,800
What's Luggage Chaos?

920
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,820
Luggage Chaos is the same thing as the candy one.

921
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,520
Only you have to put the luggage on conveyor belts and then they slowly go into a separate area that looks like a conveyor belt.

922
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,140
You can't drag the luggage into that area.

923
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,620
You have to parkour into it.

924
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,260
And then you grab the luggage off the conveyor belts.

925
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:25,720
Okay.

926
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,640
And then you put it in the candy and you just dump it down with the lever.

927
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,360
Oh, okay.

928
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,580
So it's just the lever stuff again.

929
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,700
Okay, so you...

930
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,900
It's just slightly confusing.

931
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,540
You can't just walk it to the dumping place.

932
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,700
You have to put it on the conveyor belt and then it goes through a little machine and then you grab it after.

933
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,900
I see.

934
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,760
I see.

935
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,680
It's the same thing.

936
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,500
You two are the punching people.

937
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,520
Didn't Ditto do that?

938
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,500
No, now we just put luggage on the conveyor belt.

939
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:51,740
Sweet.

940
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
We're doing it!

941
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,640
I can't believe I'm actually contributing this time.

942
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,240
Oh my god.

943
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,240
This is so different from my last Twitch Rivals.

944
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,800
Did you not do well?

945
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,020
I was not contributing.

946
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:12,860
Oh.

947
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,060
I didn't know what I was doing.

948
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,760
I still don't know what I'm doing, but like...

949
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,360
We're winning, so that's all that matters.

950
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,780
No, you're winning though.

951
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,060
Just constantly say that you do.

952
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,500
It's fine.

953
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,280
Is this Connor?

954
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,640
As in Connor...

955
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,900
His pants.

956
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,280
Oh my god!

957
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,040
Suck it!

958
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,740
I'm gonna beat you in the Tekken tournament too.

959
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,460
Unless he's on my team.

960
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Still do it!

961
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:46,760
Still win!

962
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,880
Suck it!

963
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,720
You're gonna lose to me in Tekken 8 as well.

964
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,800
What is this conversation that you're having?

965
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,720
They're asking about their favorite swear words.

966
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,880
Chib asked me about my favorite swear word.

967
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,760
And then said, whoa.

968
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,020
Whoa.

969
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,320
What was it?

970
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,600
I thought it was bitch, right?

971
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,640
Your name is inappropriate.

972
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,720
Your name is inappropriate.

973
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,260
Your name is inappropriate.

974
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,720
Your name is inappropriate.

975
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,420
I slayed cats.

976
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,040
It's a game about slaying animals.

977
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,580
It's just our team.

978
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,360
You're LARPing.

979
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,560
He likes Glorp.

980
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,760
Oh my god!

981
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,760
He loves Glorp too!

982
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,220
I play Destiny too.

983
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,780
How do you chat?

984
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,120
Oh, you enter.

985
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:50,910
What do you mean no I don't...

986
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,950
I don't.

987
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,970
If the streams are deleted, doesn't mean it never existed.

988
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,350
Like...

989
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,930
Did you stream it on Tuesdays?

990
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,090
I'm pretty sure that's a special day.

991
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,450
Oh yeah, that's a special Tuesday.

992
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,390
Yeah, I stream it on Tuesdays.

993
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,210
Every Tuesday.

994
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,470
Sunday is the only sacred day.

995
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,550
Why is Sunday a sacred day?

996
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,890
Because I don't play Overwatch.

997
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:18,650
Oh.

998
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,990
That's a variety day.

999
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,570
Wait, I thought Tuesday was a variety day.

1000
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,850
What the fuck is Tuesday?

1001
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:27,930
That's Wednesday.

1002
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,170
Wednesday and Sunday.

1003
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,210
Wait, then what's Tuesday?

1004
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,410
We don't talk about it.

1005
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,170
What's Tuesday?

1006
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,490
Then is it Overwatch?

1007
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,230
So you stream Overwatch with your VTuber?

1008
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:42,970
No.

1009
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,570
Then what the fuck is Tuesday?

1010
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,550
Tuesday is whatever I want.

1011
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:48,630
I don't know.

1012
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:48,970
It's whatever I want it to be.

1013
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,790
It's whatever I want it to be.

1014
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,670
Yeah.

1015
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,550
Valid, valid, valid.

1016
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,490
I'm valid.

1017
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,810
You're valid.

1018
00:31:58,970 --> 00:31:59,510
That's right.

1019
00:31:59,610 --> 00:31:59,950
You are.

1020
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,830
Okay, well apparently we finished this so fast that we have to wait for the other games to be done.

1021
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,650
We're just that good.

1022
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,590
We're so good at this game.

1023
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,510
Until we face the Apex team that's in this.

1024
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,650
Wait, which team is that?

1025
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,630
I don't know.

1026
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,930
That is team...

1027
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,630
It's DropStack.

1028
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,950
It's Rogue's team.

1029
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,110
Team 6.

1030
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,030
That's the Apex team.

1031
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,150
No, I think we can go against them.

1032
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,770
I mean these are basically training rounds, you know?

1033
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,710
Yeah, but it's gonna determine our seeding.

1034
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:32,890
Oh.

1035
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,330
So it's like the seeded matches.

1036
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,510
Oh my god, seeds.

1037
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:39,750
Wow.

1038
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,870
Oh my god.

1039
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:43,990
Ditto, are you awake?

1040
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,610
Yeah.

1041
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:45,910
Yeah.

1042
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,350
He's not dead inside.

1043
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,830
Ditto's just chilling.

1044
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,610
He's vibing at 4 in the morning.

1045
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,990
I haven't I haven't slept yet.

1046
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,170
Oh my god.

1047
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,290
I was playing on God's Star.

1048
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,230
You were playing on God's Star?

1049
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,310
Yeah, I just finished this main story.

1050
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,710
Oh shit.

1051
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,910
They had a concert and stuff too.

1052
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,930
Oh yes, yes, yes.

1053
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,390
It took me like 10 hours to finish the main story.

1054
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,350
10 hours?

1055
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,350
Yeah, yesterday.

1056
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,110
Wait, how long have you been playing Honkai?

1057
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,810
Today, yesterday.

1058
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,730
Did you start yesterday?

1059
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,090
No.

1060
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,310
Maybe one month?

1061
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,970
So it took like one month of like 5 plus hours of...

1062
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:42,210
I started playing this game on the first day and I stopped playing it.

1063
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,850
And I just came back.

1064
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,490
How much money did you spend?

1065
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,330
Ummm...

1066
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,190
Don't count it.

1067
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,350
It doesn't matter how much you spend the money on this game.

1068
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,810
If it doesn't matter, then you would tell me how much you spend, right?

1069
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,930
It doesn't matter if you have fun or not.

1070
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,670
Oh yeah, okay.

1071
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,410
So if it doesn't matter how much you spend, then you should be open to telling me how much you spend.

1072
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,570
I can't remember.

1073
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,150
You get it?

1074
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:19,750
I can't remember.

1075
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,390
No, I agree.

1076
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,530
I think you should actually to celebrate finishing it, I think you should spend even more money on it.

1077
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,770
I think you should celebrate.

1078
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,590
Just do more.

1079
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,970
How many characters do you have on Honkai?

1080
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,130
It's not that much because I just came back.

1081
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,350
Ummm...

1082
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:40,730
Maybe...

1083
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,510
Let me...

1084
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,170
Let me shake.

1085
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,790
Let me open up Honkai real quick.

1086
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,890
Let me shake.

1087
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,690
Wait, how many characters does Honkai even have?

1088
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,690
I have...

1089
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,150
37 characters.

1090
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,550
Wait, out of how many?

1091
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,160
Are you missing any character?

1092
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:05,840
37.

1093
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,620
Out of 37?

1094
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,400
Wait, how do you know sure for it?

1095
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,880
I don't know anything about Honkai's story.

1096
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,020
Wait, do you even gotcha?

1097
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,840
I only play gotcha games with PvP.

1098
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,080
Yeah, like what?

1099
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,000
Well, the last one I played was AFK Arena, I think.

1100
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,520
AFK Arena?

1101
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,700
Isn't that like a fucking YouTube ad sponsor game?

1102
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1103
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,920
I see it everywhere.

1104
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,260
I see it all on TikTok.

1105
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,740
I played that shit like 7 years ago.

1106
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,740
Wait, is that old?

1107
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,820
It's existed for that long?

1108
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:41,820
2018?

1109
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,960
Holy shit.

1110
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,480
Yes, sir.

1111
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,940
I haven't played a gotcha game in a while.

1112
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,880
The last gotcha game I played was Genshin because I was hella bored.

1113
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,180
How do you think about Genshin?

1114
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,640
Did you like it or did you stop because it was boring?

1115
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:53,880
Yeah.

1116
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,380
They made Ganyu, so they got that going for me.

1117
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,620
They got Ganyu.

1118
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,140
Listen, gotcha games...

1119
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:10,580
I only play gotcha games for PvP because the whole point of gotcha games is supposed to be like buying Gucci wallets but for like weebs.

1120
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,640
Yeah.

1121
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,540
Yeah.

1122
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,640
PvP roster.

1123
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,700
I'm surprised you haven't tried out Miike.

1124
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,040
Why the fuck would I play Miike?

1125
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,720
Because it's FPS.

1126
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,760
If I wanted to look at anime girl ass, I would look at something else.

1127
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,520
Like what?

1128
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,520
Like what then?

1129
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,760
Yeah?

1130
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,520
Yeah.

1131
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,060
What do you say?

1132
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,340
I think that's self-explanatory.

1133
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,280
Wait, what do you say?

1134
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,680
You know what that is?

1135
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,980
What do you say?

1136
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,440
That's a pin tie.

1137
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,620
Oh.

1138
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,900
I ain't playing no gotcha game for that.

1139
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,270
That's not cool.

1140
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,830
Alright chat, rate his taste.

1141
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,790
Is it...

1142
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,650
Wait, this is a few of the chat.

1143
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,630
Like do you have any recommendations?

1144
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,490
No, there's some good ones, but I'm not gonna say them out loud.

1145
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,030
That's TOS.

1146
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,010
Oh, yeah.

1147
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,030
Pushing Slayer.

1148
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,610
Pushing Slayer isn't TOS.

1149
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,650
Yeah, but you say it out loud on Twitch instead of writing it down.

1150
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,990
Is it really bannable?

1151
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,450
Yeah.

1152
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,890
Well, pay for your gotcha games for that.

1153
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,550
They're similar.

1154
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,610
Why would I pay for it when it's free on the internet?

1155
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,510
That's true.

1156
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,650
It's for the experience.

1157
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:46,770
It's for the experience.

1158
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,270
It's for the experience.

1159
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,610
Hell no.

1160
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,570
I want it to be a competition, okay?

1161
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,350
Hell no.

1162
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,970
You can make it competitive.

1163
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,270
You can make it competitive.

1164
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,050
It's like, how you gonna make that competitive?

1165
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,910
It's like, how you gonna make that competitive?

1166
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,990
Chat can find a way.

1167
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,210
Your chat can find a way.

1168
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,470
Not my chat.

1169
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,390
My chat is say-so.

1170
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,270
Christian friendly.

1171
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,290
Mine is full of intellectuals.

1172
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,010
Yeah.

1173
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,750
Are you dying?

1174
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,230
Are you okay?

1175
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,470
I'm sorry.

1176
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,190
After hearing you say your chat is filled with intellectuals, I couldn't take you seriously anymore.

1177
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,430
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1178
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,730
What the

1179
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:34,450
hell is that supposed to mean?

1180
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,630
Wait, there...

1181
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,750
We have to ignore the bracket.

1182
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,830
A mistake was made reporting a match.

1183
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,910
Oh, wait.

1184
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,850
Which one?

1185
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,050
I don't even know what the bracket is.

1186
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:45,090
Whose fricking line is there?

1187
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,910
Whose bracket is it?

1188
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,570
I mean, they can't really make a mistake with ours, because we just did something.

1189
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,450
Yeah, ours was so clear cut.

1190
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:57,690
Yeah.

1191
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,730
You said your chat is like say-so.

1192
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,490
Isn't that the whole thing?

1193
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,270
Like not...

1194
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,550
Like, what is say-so?

1195
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,410
Like not lewd?

1196
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:05,890
Yeah.

1197
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,830
Hey, listen.

1198
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,990
Anyone that says say-so, they're like...

1199
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,850
It's like the Christianity of V2V.

1200
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,990
They're like whole closeted freaks.

1201
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:15,690
Whoa!

1202
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,110
What is that supposed to mean?

1203
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,070
It's like Christian girls, you know?

1204
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:21,950
They're like freaks.

1205
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:22,730
Whoa!

1206
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:25,850
Whoa!

1207
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,070
They promise their bodies to God.

1208
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,070
Yeah.

1209
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:34,910
And then they threw that away once they got a taste of the forbidden fruit.

1210
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,090
Feels like you're speaking from experience.

1211
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,110
Experience?

1212
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,030
Oh my god.

1213
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:48,970
When is our fucking...

1214
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,810
When is our next bracket gonna start?

1215
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,730
We did too good.

1216
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,090
I know.

1217
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,810
We won too quickly.

1218
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,790
We're just too good.

1219
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,050
Sorry, next time I'll try to play worse so we can be less bored.

1220
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,170
No, no, no, no.

1221
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,550
We gotta be faster next time.

1222
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,050
I get it.

1223
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,110
Next time we gotta be even faster.

1224
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,670
We watched you walk into their goal in the first five seconds.

1225
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,750
I don't think we can be faster.

1226
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,190
We just couldn't register.

1227
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,370
They couldn't register what I did there.

1228
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:20,650
They couldn't register what I did there.

1229
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:32,090
Oh, I like the fact that we have Pussy Slayer on the team so that as we do better and better we just have to constantly pay attention to the phrase Pussy Slayer as they talk about it.

1230
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,510
I thrive on that.

1231
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,650
Good.

1232
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,670
I got AFK kicked from the lobby.

1233
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,330
So I was on the tab for some reason.

1234
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:41,790
Yeah.

1235
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,830
I almost got AFK kicked.

1236
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,090
I'm gonna use this time in a runescape actually.

1237
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,830
You got a runescape?

1238
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,210
Wait, what are you grinding for?

1239
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,950
I'm getting my Warp Scepter right now so then I can clear barrows more efficiently.

1240
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,590
Sweet.

1241
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,010
Wait, what skill is that?

1242
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,190
Well, Warp Scepter is for magic and then barrows is for barrows gear.

1243
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,710
And then so you're trying to get better gear right now?

1244
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,170
Yeah.

1245
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,210
I'm getting mid gear for my Iron Man.

1246
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,470
Oh, you're Iron Man-ing!

1247
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:11,850
Oh!

1248
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,370
That makes sense.

1249
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,110
Oh my god.

1250
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,710
He's multitasking just like a true Overwatch player.

1251
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,310
While waiting in queue.

1252
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,570
Yeah, he's maxing.

1253
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,470
I forgot about how long it takes in between matches.

1254
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,870
Yeah, that's why you have to start saying, like, start making jokes or something.

1255
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,630
Oh yeah, help you.

1256
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,370
Yeah, just commentary.

1257
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,770
Help entertain your chat.

1258
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,890
Brie, entertain my chat for me.

1259
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,610
My chat's like sludge.

1260
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,230
Ah!

1261
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,850
Ah!

1262
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,710
Yeah, be funny for my chat, Brie.

1263
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,730
This is your purpose now.

1264
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,690
Ah!

1265
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:03,950
What, uh, what, uh, what, uh, what, uh, what, uh, what, uh, what was the pirate's favorite letter?

1266
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,350
What?

1267
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,610
No, it's the pirate's favorite letter.

1268
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,830
It's the C's, stupid!

1269
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:09,950
He, ah!

1270
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,110
Yes!

1271
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,250
You just call me stupid?

1272
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,730
What the?

1273
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,570
If we, if you think you're so smart, what's 25 plus 25?

1274
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,430
Uh, 72.

1275
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,530
That's not that.

1276
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,230
What?

1277
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,470
It's not 72.

1278
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,430
I said so confidently.

1279
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,590
Why is it 72?

1280
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,390
I don't know!

1281
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:35,290
Where did the 72 come from?

1282
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,310
I don't know!

1283
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,890
Everything's falling apart.

1284
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,450
Everything, oh no.

1285
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,170
Our momentum is gone!

1286
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,710
We lost our momentum!

1287
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,270
No!

1288
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,350
We were kicked!

1289
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,790
We got kicked out, that means they're making the room, right?

1290
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,370
No, you got AFK kicked, maybe.

1291
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,910
No, no, they removed us.

1292
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,270
Yeah, they did!

1293
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,630
Yeah, they moved us.

1294
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,150
We're fighting...

1295
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,850
We're fighting Kendomerce now.

1296
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,410
What did?

1297
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:06,910
Yeah!

1298
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,390
Finally!

1299
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,810
Get off RuneScape!

1300
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,990
Aw, yippee!

1301
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,310
Get off RuneScape right now!

1302
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,390
I'm getting to my tortoises and then I'll get off.

1303
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,330
Let's see...

1304
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,510
Typing in the Twitch rivals.

1305
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,550
The Twitch rivals.

1306
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,810
It's not showing up.

1307
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,510
It showed up for me.

1308
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,010
I spelled it wrong.

1309
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,390
I just copied and pasted.

1310
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,230
That's actually good.

1311
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,850
I don't know why I'm typing them manually.

1312
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,250
Okay, I'll just manually.

1313
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,110
Ditto.

1314
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:41,590
Okay.

1315
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,210
Okay.

1316
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,710
I wonder if they won their last one.

1317
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,130
Guys, did the Kendomerce team win their last round?

1318
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,550
Stream sniped for me right now.

1319
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:52,870
But like...

1320
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,670
But not like unethically.

1321
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:57,750
Unethically?

1322
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,890
Ethically stream sniped just to tell me if they won their last game.

1323
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:02,870
They did!

1324
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:03,770
Wait, they did!

1325
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,330
They're gamers!

1326
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,510
They won their last match.

1327
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,810
So they might be gamers.

1328
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,830
Where the fuck is PussySlayer?

1329
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:12,990
Oh yeah, he's still walking over.

1330
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:14,950
PussySlayer alive.

1331
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,750
The last man there.

1332
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,810
Yeah, stream sniped respectfully guys.

1333
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,750
Alright.

1334
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,310
Kendomerce.

1335
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:33,970
They're here to...

1336
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,290
Did you guys win your last match?

1337
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,890
Win your last match?

1338
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,330
Oh, they did.

1339
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,290
They did?

1340
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:45,850
I know.

1341
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:46,450
I just wanted them to...

1342
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,850
I just wanted them to respond.

1343
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,210
I know they did, so I want to see if they lied to me.

1344
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,530
Oh no, I asked them immediately.

1345
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,130
Oh, okay!

1346
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,050
We did it.

1347
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:57,670
We're bad.

1348
00:44:58,850 --> 00:44:59,730
We're making...

1349
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:04,090
We're gonna make them think that we're really bad so they go easy on us.

1350
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,230
That's a good idea.

1351
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:06,770
Yeah, yeah.

1352
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,730
We got too old.

1353
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:15,630
Okay,

1354
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:22,670
we got it.

1355
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,650
We have to make them underestimate us.

1356
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:28,310
PussySlayer...

1357
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,910
Make them pity us so that we can do better.

1358
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,530
...was a huge...

1359
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,610
It's okay, we can do this, guys.

1360
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,430
We can do this.

1361
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:48,490
We can do this.

1362
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,330
What the fuck is this?

1363
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,550
That's the...

1364
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,050
I haven't played this one before.

1365
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,690
Put the luggage on the conveyor belt in the middle and then it goes under those little...

1366
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:58,950
like a little...

1367
00:45:59,530 --> 00:45:59,890
platform.

1368
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,350
Yeah, you guys have to beat them up.

1369
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:02,150
Yeah.

1370
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,730
Yeah, so you and Tia are gonna beat them up as usual.

1371
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,890
I'm just gonna beat the shit out of them.

1372
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:09,290
Yeah.

1373
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:16,970
They can go and take things from the conveyor belt in both the hub area and then our separate little area where we score points.

1374
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,510
So like...

1375
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,770
We gotta just keep it on.

1376
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:23,190
Okay, so we'll figure this out, right?

1377
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,950
We're gonna figure this out.

1378
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,330
Yeah, I believe in you guys.

1379
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,370
I'm just gonna punch shit.

1380
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,810
Thank you.

1381
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:30,450
That works, honestly.

1382
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,150
Alright, here we go.

1383
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,270
Wait, there's a golden case.

1384
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,830
Yeah, it's worth a lot.

1385
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,790
Yeah, somebody grab the golden case.

1386
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,050
Oh, you grab...

1387
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:38,490
Oh!

1388
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,070
No, he got it!

1389
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,370
Wait, he just ran into the thing.

1390
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,430
I'm going into their spawn.

1391
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,130
Wait, what color are we?

1392
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:46,910
Are we red?

1393
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,190
Okay, I'm going to red.

1394
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,230
I'm trying to pull.

1395
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,450
Guys, they're all pulling me.

1396
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,330
I can't even bring the luggage over.

1397
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,850
They're pulling me.

1398
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:57,990
I'm out.

1399
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,490
Guys, they're really good.

1400
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,730
Yo, the gold briefcase is stuck.

1401
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:02,570
I'm stuck under it.

1402
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,430
I can't roll!

1403
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,570
How do I get over?

1404
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,410
Guys, how do I...

1405
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,770
How do I get over this?

1406
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:15,410
Oh, thank you!

1407
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:16,790
Guys, how do I...

1408
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,870
How do we get over...

1409
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:21,570
Guys, I don't...

1410
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,030
You can't get over if you have a suitcase in your hand.

1411
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,170
Oh, wait, then...

1412
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,790
You have to put it on the conveyor belt.

1413
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:30,050
Oh!

1414
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,370
Guys, I think they're winning.

1415
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,050
Yeah, they are.

1416
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:35,750
We were so...

1417
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,770
No, I'm spawn camping them.

1418
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,190
We're so confused about this game mode.

1419
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:40,770
Okay.

1420
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:41,790
I need help.

1421
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,090
They're harassing me.

1422
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,790
They're picking me up.

1423
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:45,770
I can't get off.

1424
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,630
This isn't going well.

1425
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,530
Wait, we have too many people on their side.

1426
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,270
You're taking it away from them!

1427
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,270
You're taking it away from the goal!

1428
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,390
Wait, I am.

1429
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,410
Put it here and then put it under there.

1430
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,210
I can't go.

1431
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,890
I don't know.

1432
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,330
They're harassing me right now.

1433
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,190
I'm here.

1434
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,910
Guys, they are putting a lot...

1435
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,830
They are putting a lot on my end.

1436
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,770
I figured out how to do this, but these guys are actually...

1437
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,710
Okay, if you just hold it...

1438
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,650
Yeah, I can't.

1439
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,050
Oh, no!

1440
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,810
I'm dead.

1441
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,250
They trained!

1442
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:25,930
They have a goal!

1443
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,930
They actually know what to do.

1444
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:28,950
No, you grabbed me!

1445
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,750
Oh, my God.

1446
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:30,890
It's okay.

1447
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:31,990
I grabbed the keys, though.

1448
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,310
It's okay.

1449
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,070
Okay.

1450
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,110
Go to the lever!

1451
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,110
Go to the lever!

1452
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:38,450
It's fine!

1453
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:38,850
I'm just doing it.

1454
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:41,690
Please!

1455
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:46,230
We're so new!

1456
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,030
I said come closer to us!

1457
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:49,810
Why are they being nice?

1458
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:50,850
This isn't going well!

1459
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,150
This isn't going well!

1460
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,110
Oh, sorry.

1461
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,810
That was a bad hit.

1462
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:58,210
Oh, my God.

1463
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,230
This is so hard.

1464
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,650
They're so good!

1465
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,850
I'm getting one man harassed!

1466
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,150
They took my hat!

1467
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,790
My beautiful hat!

1468
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:11,710
Guys, this might be...

1469
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,370
This might be a team.

1470
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,430
This might be a team.

1471
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:15,590
This might be a team.

1472
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:18,910
That might win this.

1473
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,330
Take it!

1474
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:19,490
Take it!

1475
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:20,330
I fucked them up!

1476
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,590
Oh, help!

1477
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:23,510
Yeah!

1478
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:23,830
Yeah!

1479
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:24,110
I got him.

1480
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,750
I dropped it.

1481
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:27,190
We're good?

1482
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:28,590
Oh, shit!

1483
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,610
It knocked me out!

1484
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,390
Wait, there's a taser gun on my head!

1485
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:35,810
Oh, no!

1486
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:38,930
I'm dying!

1487
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,590
Guys, this might be a GG go next.

1488
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:45,170
Okay, no, we gotta get a strat down.

1489
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:45,550
It's fine.

1490
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,270
This is Kyle.

1491
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,670
This is definitely not our game.

1492
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,270
Okay, the next one.

1493
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,170
Guys, they definitely know we're bad now.

1494
00:49:59,250 --> 00:49:59,850
It's okay.

1495
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,710
The next one is the soccer game.

1496
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:02,850
We can do that.

1497
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:06,990
Okay, I'll beat up the goalie.

1498
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,310
That's my job.

1499
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,110
I'll just beat up the goalie.

1500
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,690
You guys do the other stuff.

1501
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:14,510
That's just not our mode!

1502
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,310
No, this is just...

1503
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:16,950
Yeah, this wasn't it.

1504
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:22,810
Guys, this is not the Apex Pro team that scrimmed every day.

1505
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,290
Well, these guys have scrimmed.

1506
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:26,930
They know what they're doing.

1507
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:27,530
They have plans.

1508
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,990
Maybe the Apex team was scrimming this team.

1509
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:32,690
Honestly.

1510
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,370
.

1511
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:37,670
Round 2.

1512
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:38,390
Fight.

1513
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,990
Wait, are we playing a round 2?

1514
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,290
No, I think we're just...

1515
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:42,590
I think we're just waiting.

1516
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:48,430
Instructions were definitely unclear for that game.

1517
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:49,510
We can win this one though.

1518
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,210
Oh, they're Minecraft?

1519
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,090
That makes so much more sense.

1520
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:56,490
They're what?

1521
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,330
They're so coordinated.

1522
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:03,230
Minecraft players are the god gamers of minigames.

1523
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,310
They're just...

1524
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,030
They're...

1525
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,810
Oh my gosh.

1526
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:12,530
I remember when I did Twitch Rivals in Fortnite and a Minecraft player won like top 5 or something.

1527
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:13,690
Oh my god.

1528
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,170
Yeah.

1529
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,150
In the Fortnite fucking tournament.

1530
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:19,050
This one I think we have to headbutt more.

1531
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:21,390
How do we headbutt?

1532
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:22,470
Or like we can headbutt?

1533
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,730
I don't know.

1534
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:24,710
Middle mouse button.

1535
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,790
Okay, what is middle mouse button?

1536
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:27,830
I don't know!

1537
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:29,550
Instructions unclear.

1538
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,270
Guys, that's okay.

1539
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,930
We can lose like one round.

1540
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,770
One matchup.

1541
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:37,310
It's fine.

1542
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,270
No, we can't lose.

1543
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,870
Otherwise it'll seem like we're cheating.

1544
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,210
We just did the... you know...

1545
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,030
It'll make the story better.

1546
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:45,070
That's true.

1547
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:45,490
That's true.

1548
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:47,510
Oh, we're already going.

1549
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:48,570
Oh, this is not good.

1550
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:49,330
Oh, wait, wait.

1551
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,330
Two of them are knocked out though.

1552
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,350
Two of them are already knocked out.

1553
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,770
I'm going to go...

1554
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:55,210
I'm going over to beat up the goalie.

1555
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,250
Oh no.

1556
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,850
I got it out.

1557
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,190
It's fine.

1558
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:58,570
It's okay.

1559
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,410
I'm beating up the goalie and I'm distracted.

1560
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,130
Goalie for our team.

1561
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,690
Guys, I'm distracting the goalie.

1562
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,110
We can't hit each other.

1563
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,410
Okay.

1564
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,170
I got ball in midfield.

1565
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,110
Guys, I got the goalie out.

1566
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:11,970
I got the goalie out.

1567
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:12,610
The goalie's out.

1568
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:13,610
The goal.

1569
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,150
We're trying to get the ball in mid.

1570
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,310
Guys, I'm distracting the goalie.

1571
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:19,670
That's good.

1572
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:20,030
That's good.

1573
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,550
This goalie is so out now.

1574
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,250
We're doing our part.

1575
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,610
I'm doing my part.

1576
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,510
Get out.

1577
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,570
Oh no!

1578
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,050
I hit the top limb!

1579
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,470
The goalie was gone!

1580
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,410
Listen, this ball is hard to control sometimes.

1581
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,550
Oh my god.

1582
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:34,690
That was a good hit too.

1583
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,030
I'm really bad at Rocket League.

1584
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,070
This is not...

1585
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,250
Guys, this is literally a 3v3.

1586
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,610
To be fair, this is a 3v3.

1587
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,210
The goalie and I...

1588
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,910
We're toughening it out right now.

1589
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,750
Get out, goalie!

1590
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:49,470
We're fine.

1591
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,890
We're fine.

1592
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,090
Oh shit.

1593
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:53,150
It's okay.

1594
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:56,090
The goalie and I are having our own slamdown.

1595
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:56,230
I'm owning them.

1596
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:56,430
Wait a minute.

1597
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,050
Oh my god.

1598
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,290
The goalie is out!

1599
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,450
I didn't have enough stamina.

1600
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:05,830
Oh, we rocked.

1601
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,210
I knocked the goalie away.

1602
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,570
He took away my aim!

1603
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:13,310
I'm out.

1604
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:13,770
I'm dead.

1605
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:14,790
Get out!

1606
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,210
This ball is hard to control.

1607
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,990
They're like all rolling and stuff to go faster.

1608
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,350
Yeah, you headbutt to roll.

1609
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,650
Yeah.

1610
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,030
I keep forgetting.

1611
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,610
Oh my god.

1612
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:36,050
Oh god.

1613
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:36,690
Oh, I'm out.

1614
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:37,030
I'm out.

1615
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,230
I'm out, but don't worry.

1616
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,390
I'm gonna get that goalie out too.

1617
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,110
That's fucking right.

1618
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,190
You thought you could have it.

1619
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:44,470
Chill.

1620
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:46,010
That's fucking right.

1621
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,930
How the do you roll in this game?

1622
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,670
I don't know what it is for a controller.

1623
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:52,910
Oh, I figured it out.

1624
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,690
Oh, he knocked me out.

1625
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:56,230
But that's okay.

1626
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,130
He thought he could have it.

1627
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:58,350
Good.

1628
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:59,830
That's fucking right.

1629
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,830
Get distracted by me.

1630
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:02,870
No.

1631
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:03,750
No!

1632
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,630
What the...

1633
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:04,890
Whoa!

1634
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:07,490
That was like the...

1635
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,510
I won my game.

1636
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,150
Guys, I think if they score the next one it's over.

1637
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:12,490
Oh...

1638
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,490
What's going on?

1639
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,770
Holy shit!

1640
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,510
What the fuck am I watching?

1641
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,450
Are you joking?

1642
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,310
Maybe we need another one.

1643
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,710
Maybe we need another player.

1644
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:26,150
Wait.

1645
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,630
Boo!

1646
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,470
Boo!

1647
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,950
Boo!

1648
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,230
There you go, I did it.

1649
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:41,110
You spent the entire game just finding someone in the corner and then instantly won.

1650
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,810
It's just that easy, what can I say.

1651
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,590
It's actually that fucking easy.

1652
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:51,690
That's fucking right, Rabbit.

1653
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,230
You thought I was done with you?

1654
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,050
The goalie is distracted again!

1655
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,850
You think I was done with you?

1656
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:06,310
I'm dead.

1657
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,350
They hit it the wrong way.

1658
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,650
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.

1659
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:13,270
Don't worry, I'm the striker.

1660
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,890
The little bear guy here, or the corgi, he's the one that sets up the combo.

1661
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:17,990
It's fine, it's fine.

1662
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,810
Oh shit, guys, I don't know.

1663
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:22,430
I'm gonna fucking beat up this guy though.

1664
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:23,670
Okay, okay.

1665
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:24,950
Oh no.

1666
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:25,950
No!

1667
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,390
I hit it midfield, I'm gonna midfield.

1668
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,250
I'm rolling as well, I'm doing their strat.

1669
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:32,810
Okay, I'm waiting for you guys.

1670
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:34,430
No!

1671
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:34,950
Okay.

1672
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,970
Oh no, oh no, I'm waiting, I'm waiting for the fucking...

1673
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:39,550
Ow.

1674
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:41,570
Oh no!

1675
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,670
You told me you blocked it with your body, thank you!

1676
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:44,150
No!

1677
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,430
Oh my god, that was so close!

1678
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:47,630
Okay.

1679
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,110
I hit it down, I hit it down mid.

1680
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:51,250
Okay.

1681
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,430
I'm coming over.

1682
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,690
I lost my hat!

1683
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,870
No, I lost my hat!

1684
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:57,390
No, my hat's blocking me!

1685
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:01,030
My hat actually blocked me!

1686
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,190
Oh, that's it, we're good.

1687
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:04,790
The one time.

1688
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:05,410
Oh, nice one.

1689
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,570
The one time I didn't distract the goalie.

1690
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:07,890
Oh no, okay, it's still over here.

1691
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:08,410
It's okay.

1692
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,750
The one time I knew I should never left my post.

1693
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,930
You thought you could get away from me.

1694
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,390
You thought you could get away from me.

1695
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:18,610
Okay.

1696
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,470
Okay, she did get away from me.

1697
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:21,230
Oh, no.

1698
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:21,630
I'm sorry.

1699
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:23,270
I'm sorry.

1700
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,450
The goalie's gone!

1701
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,250
The goalie's gone!

1702
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,050
The goalie's gone!

1703
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:26,930
Quick!

1704
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,150
We need to get the ball over there.

1705
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,150
Yes,

1706
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:35,010
nice!

1707
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,910
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1708
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:37,930
Nice, nice, nice.

1709
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,050
There's a goalie there, Doki!

1710
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,410
I feel like I have to play defense.

1711
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:40,850
I'm scared.

1712
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,290
The goalie's gone back up!

1713
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:47,250
I didn't want you guys to go there while I distract the goalie!

1714
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:49,810
The problem is, I need to play defense.

1715
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,850
I can't play defense and offense at the same time!

1716
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,070
That's what midfield is!

1717
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:54,690
That's what midfield is!

1718
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,870
Midfield is G in offense!

1719
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,170
That's the name for midfield!

1720
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,850
If I go full offense then...

1721
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:03,350
Oh, wait.

1722
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,670
Alright, I'm going on the offense.

1723
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,030
Alright.

1724
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,430
Okay.

1725
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,270
Okay.

1726
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:09,930
Alright.

1727
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:10,350
What the?

1728
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:11,130
It's back.

1729
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,210
Oh my god.

1730
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,030
Oh my god.

1731
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,370
Okay, alright.

1732
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,810
You go offense.

1733
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:16,630
I'll do mid.

1734
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:18,610
Okay.

1735
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:19,510
I can't punch.

1736
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:20,590
Oh my god.

1737
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:21,970
Oh my god.

1738
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:22,570
I ran out of stamina!

1739
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh my god.

1740
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,320
Jumping and kicking into it is very good.

1741
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,060
Okay.

1742
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,220
Okay.

1743
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,840
Oh, whoa.

1744
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:33,680
Okay.

1745
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,640
Wait, I thought you were fucking offense.

1746
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,360
What happened?

1747
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:40,780
I'm just trying to do what I think will be the best right now.

1748
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,400
Look at that.

1749
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,600
Look at that edge.

1750
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,660
Yeah, but there's no offense!

1751
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:48,940
There's no offense!

1752
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,920
I'm scared if I'm not over there, the ball's going to go into the goal.

1753
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,360
Oh, big pass.

1754
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,280
There it is!

1755
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,180
There you go!

1756
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,660
You're offense, Joe!

1757
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,240
This is your job!

1758
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:10,520
Yeah, well, unfortunately, I pass in mid.

1759
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,120
Oh my god!

1760
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,940
You're passing!

1761
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,260
Okay.

1762
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,120
Okay.

1763
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:13,880
I'm going in.

1764
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,380
I'm going out.

1765
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,700
You know how soccer works?

1766
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,940
It involves passing!

1767
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,120
I thought you were offense!

1768
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,620
Fucking offense!

1769
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,600
I can't solo Ronaldo this!

1770
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,340
I thought you were Messi!

1771
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:25,980
What happened?

1772
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,280
I saw...

1773
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:28,760
Oh, yeah!

1774
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,160
Let's go!

1775
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:29,940
Watch your part!

1776
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:30,640
What is this?

1777
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,140
I have three on me!

1778
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,340
We have a minute!

1779
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,420
I'm trying!

1780
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,560
I got it, I got it.

1781
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,300
Oh my god!

1782
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,880
All I'm saying is I would have scored.

1783
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,540
Nice block.

1784
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,760
Bullshit.

1785
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,000
Bullshit!

1786
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,560
Nice!

1787
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,080
Nice!

1788
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:57,620
Nice!

1789
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,700
We definitely will lose!

1790
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,520
I did score though!

1791
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,560
I gave us our one point!

1792
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,640
Hey, I set up that score.

1793
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,740
I set up that score.

1794
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,560
Oh, you did a good job.

1795
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:08,820
Thank you!

1796
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,140
I jump kicked into it at the start.

1797
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,080
It's just so sad.

1798
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,900
It just wasn't for us.

1799
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,980
This was not our round.

1800
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,700
We were against Minecraft players.

1801
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,280
If this was banjo ball, they would have been shit on.

1802
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:26,980
What?

1803
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:27,620
I'm sorry.

1804
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,540
What the fuck is banjo ball?

1805
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,520
It's a Warcraft 3 custom game.

1806
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,900
You should set up a Warcraft 3 Twitch Rivals and then invite them back for a rematch.

1807
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,960
I've been saying that.

1808
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,780
I've been saying that.

1809
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,280
Wait, why can't you do it?

1810
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,240
I'm not a setup guy.

1811
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,520
You're not a setup guy?

1812
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:46,760
No.

1813
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,260
Basically, I'm like a side character main character.

1814
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:51,920
Oh, okay.

1815
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,140
Wait, but like Twitch Rivals is like really easy though to set up.

1816
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,320
Cause like Twitch does most of the work.

1817
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,840
Nah, then I would have to like message someone.

1818
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,800
That's out of my pay grade.

1819
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,600
They come to you.

1820
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,900
I'd rather play RuneScape.

1821
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,300
Has there ever been a RuneScape Twitch Rivals?

1822
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,420
Uh, they've had like Deadman modes and shit.

1823
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,500
What's Deadman mode?

1824
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:22,840
I don't know.

1825
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,940
It's like basically where you play RuneScape normally.

1826
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,620
But you have insane XP rates and if you die once, you're out of the tournament.

1827
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,280
Oh shit.

1828
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,180
It's basically like a giant battle royale.

1829
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,060
But the entire RuneScape map.

1830
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,900
Wait, were you part of it or?

1831
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,760
Hell no.

1832
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,400
I know, it seems- why not?

1833
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,480
I thought you loved RuneScape.

1834
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,800
I'm not that autistic.

1835
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,340
But you are on the spectrum though.

1836
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,500
Cause I remember you took the test.

1837
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,760
Hell no.

1838
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,500
Yes you did.

1839
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,400
You took the test.

1840
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:05,520
You took the test.

1841
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:09,100
Listen, every time I've gone to a psychologist, they've said I'm normal.

1842
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,400
I don't know what to tell you.

1843
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,240
Yes but you took the test.

1844
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,440
It's okay, are you saying that an internet test is better?

1845
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,420
It was a really good internet test though.

1846
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,340
It was like a couple of pages long.

1847
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,780
It was like a couple of pages long.

1848
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,900
They were trying to make me take the test and I was like, I'm scared of knowing what I am.

1849
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,140
It said I might be.

1850
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,420
It said I might be.

1851
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:36,500
Oh.

1852
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,400
Wait, do you remember the number?

1853
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:48,000
Uh, there's a different- in one Discord I'm in, we make sure everyone takes the test and then we put the number beside their name of the test.

1854
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,040
That's really funny.

1855
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,480
What's the number?

1856
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,680
I was a 28, but if I answer the question like I'm able to imagine things, I was a 6.

1857
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,960
What does that mean?

1858
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,120
I can't imagine things.

1859
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,100
I was a- Oh yeah, yeah, I remember you had an amputation.

1860
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,340
Yeah, yeah.

1861
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,340
I was a- I was a- I was a 169.

1862
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,720
That's a different test.

1863
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,880
I'm thinking it went that high.

1864
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,380
Oh, okay.

1865
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,820
Is that- wait, wait.

1866
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,900
Higher is more...

1867
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,780
It's more- Oh!

1868
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:20,740
More flavor.

1869
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,240
More flavor.

1870
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,360
More flavor?

1871
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,340
More flavor?

1872
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:25,700
Yeah.

1873
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:32,260
Just a more, I guess like a more delicious type.

1874
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:33,580
Yeah.

1875
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,480
That's what that- Yeah.

1876
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,680
Autism is tasty.

1877
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,120
Yummy.

1878
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,740
Apparently there's one more in game they have to wait to finish.

1879
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,520
And then- That we weren't the slowest?

1880
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,600
That was like the world's longest match.

1881
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,440
That was the longest soccer match ever though.

1882
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,260
It wasn't that long.

1883
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,360
Actually, to be fair, we did lose really quickly.

1884
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,840
And then the last one was just long.

1885
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,700
Okay, the luggage one was- yeah.

1886
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,500
That was a disaster.

1887
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:07,920
The luggage one was- yeah, that was a- accidentally like- I was like, took some of our briefcases to the end.

1888
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,260
Oh my god.

1889
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,160
I was confused.

1890
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,620
I was confused.

1891
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,400
The instructions were so unclear.

1892
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,940
You'll get it next time.

1893
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:31,060
It's okay, if they put that in that- if they put another round of that in there, it'll be easy.

1894
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,060
We'll know what we do.

1895
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,060
We have a system.

1896
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,100
We'll be- we're gonna be a- It's okay.

1897
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,500
So ready for the next round.

1898
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,800
I'm almost ready.

1899
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,540
What is the third game?

1900
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:47,940
The third round is team score into the game.

1901
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:48,980
What's into the game?

1902
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,380
Oh, is that the arcade?

1903
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:55,900
No, we're doing Winter is Coming.

1904
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,400
No, that's round two.

1905
01:03:59,160 --> 01:03:59,720
Oh.

1906
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,360
Are we still on round... oh, wait, no.

1907
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,020
We're on round three.

1908
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,180
We lost two.

1909
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,820
Into the game.

1910
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,020
Yeah, so...

1911
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:07,880
Am I allowed to Google it?

1912
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,640
Am I Google that?

1913
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:10,120
That's the arcade one.

1914
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,020
Yeah, the arcade.

1915
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,360
Eww.

1916
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,920
Oh my god.

1917
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,820
So we need someone that's dedicated and going into the game.

1918
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,600
I can do that.

1919
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,200
Oh, wait.

1920
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:30,060
We can also... I found out that if you take their arcade machine, you can go to the bombs yourself and make them lose scores.

1921
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:30,460
Oh.

1922
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,260
Yeah, but I feel like that's a waste because then you're just going to get punched out.

1923
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,400
That's true.

1924
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,720
Or do you still get the shield when you go into this?

1925
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:38,840
Yeah, you get the shield though.

1926
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,300
So like, it's worth the risk to make them lose points.

1927
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,460
Yeah, and you're wasting time.

1928
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,280
Yeah.

1929
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,660
So like, I feel like if you knock them out, you go to...

1930
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:50,000
Oh, Team Doki, feel free to leave the lobby.

1931
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,720
Oh, they want us to leave.

1932
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,080
Okay.

1933
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:52,480
Why do we have to leave?

1934
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,200
Okay, I guess we lost.

1935
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:53,800
Because we're the freaking losers.

1936
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,120
Yeah, this is... we're the losers.

1937
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,740
We have to leave.

1938
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,560
For every winner, there is a loser.

1939
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,760
I thought we were going to win.

1940
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:04,960
Um...

1941
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,180
I thought...

1942
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:07,940
Why did Luigi win?

1943
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,480
Oh my gosh.

1944
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,740
You know like, when they did the year of Luigi, like Nintendo ended up losing so much money for that.

1945
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,860
So they never give Luigi anything ever again.

1946
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:17,660
Really?

1947
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:18,240
Yeah.

1948
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:18,780
I guess people were like, oh...

1949
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,480
It was like their worst financial year ever.

1950
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,500
That's the damn problem with these corpos.

1951
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,320
They just look at the finances and not the lives of other characters.

1952
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:32,720
Their goddamn shareholders and stockholders got them by the britches.

1953
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:37,710
Unbelievable.

1954
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,230
Yeah.

1955
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,810
It's not about the money.

1956
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:42,230
Luigi didn't deserve this.

1957
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,210
I got my Warp Scepter.

1958
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:50,290
Oh yeah, high five Rush.

1959
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:51,450
That was so sad.

1960
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:52,170
When I...

1961
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:52,950
The...

1962
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:53,990
The company...

1963
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,270
High five Rush.

1964
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:56,050
The company closed down.

1965
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:56,850
I'll remember you always.

1966
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:58,010
That was so sad.

1967
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,310
How the hell do I charge this thing?

1968
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:00,750
Charge what?

1969
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:03,430
My Warp Scepter that I got as a drop from...

1970
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,630
Warp Scepter?

1971
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,510
That's what your company's game is.

1972
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:06,650
Yeah.

1973
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,210
An XP map.

1974
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:08,870
I'm XP maxing right now.

1975
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,510
Wait, that's true.

1976
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:11,710
I should go do my dailies.

1977
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:13,350
Wait, not on RuneScape, but...

1978
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:13,730
Yeah.

1979
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,150
Did I...

1980
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,110
Are you doing your dailies?

1981
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,490
Did you do your Honkai...

1982
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:18,610
Honkai dailies?

1983
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,050
Yeah.

1984
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:21,610
Did you do your...

1985
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,190
I'm...

1986
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,830
I'm doing it right now.

1987
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,370
You're doing it right now.

1988
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:25,710
See?

1989
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:27,630
We're all XP maxing right now.

1990
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:32,070
Am I the only one just relaxing, just chilling?

1991
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,050
Hey, I...

1992
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:37,450
I have the ability to multitask, so...

1993
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,190
I'm not the only one.

1994
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:39,150
That's a lie.

1995
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,690
Multitasking isn't real.

1996
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,790
I'm literally doing it right now.

1997
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:43,250
That's a lie.

1998
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,190
I'm talking, I'm streaming, I'm RuneScaping, I'm in Twitch Rivals tournament.

1999
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,470
Yeah, but then you're like using less of your...

2000
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,030
I'm looking at Twitter, I'm alt-tabbing, I'm going left, I'm going right.

2001
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:54,010
Yeah, but then you're putting like 20% of effort on each of it.

2002
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,270
Drinking my Coke Zero.

2003
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,830
So you're not putting 100% effort.

2004
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,470
Yeah, but RuneScape is very AFK-able.

2005
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,450
Yeah, but then you're doing all these other stuff too at once.

2006
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,830
So you're splitting your mind.

2007
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:07,430
Yeah, but I don't need...

2008
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,170
You're splitting your mind.

2009
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:08,470
You're splitting your mind.

2010
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,050
You're splitting your mind.

2011
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:14,950
So it's not like actual min-maxing.

2012
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:16,450
You're min-minning.

2013
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:18,750
No, I'm max-minning.

2014
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:19,730
Oh, we got it.

2015
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,170
Okay, wait.

2016
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,050
You're min-minning.

2017
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:23,410
Oh yeah, the lobby's up by the way.

2018
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,470
Did this team win their last game?

2019
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:29,450
Did Joe Bartolozzi won their last game, chat?

2020
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:35,640
No.

2021
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:35,780
He did it, they lost.

2022
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,580
Wait, Joe Bartolozzi?

2023
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,580
That's the TikToker.

2024
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,100
He's a TikToker?

2025
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:40,720
Who's he?

2026
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,340
He's a TikToker.

2027
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:41,860
He's a TikToker.

2028
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:42,580
Yeah.

2029
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,440
Wait, what does...

2030
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,040
He TikTokes.

2031
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,320
What TikTok does he do?

2032
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,800
He screams.

2033
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:47,860
He screams?

2034
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,100
Yeah.

2035
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,320
Wait, how many followers does he have?

2036
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,060
A lot.

2037
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,060
Joe...

2038
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:53,780
Yeah, I think a lot.

2039
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:54,440
Bart.

2040
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,100
Is he an actual real guy?

2041
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,680
Oh my god, he is a real guy.

2042
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,140
Wait, wait.

2043
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,920
You think he's fake or something?

2044
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,860
What does that mean?

2045
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,880
Holy shit, he has 24 million followers?

2046
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,820
What the fuck does he do?

2047
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:08,360
He TikToks.

2048
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,980
Oh my god, what is TikToks like?

2049
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:11,240
He TikToks.

2050
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:11,340
He TikToks.

2051
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,180
He screams.

2052
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,280
Yeah, that's it.

2053
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,320
That's good to know.

2054
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,880
All right, I'm gonna watch this.

2055
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,200
Okay, I'm actually curious.

2056
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,220
What is this TikTok?

2057
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,120
Oh,

2058
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,080
he's a reactor.

2059
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:33,680
Yeah, he screams.

2060
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:34,680
That's it?

2061
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,140
That's how he reacts?

2062
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,360
Wait, where's my 24 million followers?

2063
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,420
I scream all the time.

2064
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,040
3, 1, 2, 0.

2065
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,220
No, we lost.

2066
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,300
We lost.

2067
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,300
We are...

2068
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:45,780
We are...

2069
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:47,060
We are very bad.

2070
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,480
Cookie, watch me.

2071
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,740
Oh, I did.

2072
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:55,680
I did invite you.

2073
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,760
Okay, I'll do my union.

2074
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,580
Sorry to break it to you, Pucko.

2075
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,880
Bro, he's a party animal streamer...

2076
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,500
That is...

2077
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,640
I'm sorry.

2078
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:12,760
What?

2079
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,420
That you have to do this.

2080
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,660
He tells me to win if you get kicked off.

2081
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,340
Wait.

2082
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:46,730
Wait, what?

2083
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:51,930
What do you mean?

2084
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:06,450
We're ready.

2085
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:07,950
Alright, into the game.

2086
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,910
Okay, I'll work on doing...

2087
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:12,270
Wait, who's defending and who's...

2088
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:13,090
I'm just gonna beat the shit out of them.

2089
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:17,070
Okay, but are you defending beating the shit out of them or offense beating the shit out of them?

2090
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:17,590
Offense.

2091
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:18,210
Offense?

2092
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:21,250
Okay, I'll go with Shore 4 and then Bri and Ditto go defense.

2093
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:22,810
Okay.

2094
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:24,750
I'll focus on Arcane.

2095
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,470
Alright, we got this.

2096
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:28,690
Arcane?

2097
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:30,030
League of Legends?

2098
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:30,210
Arcane?

2099
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:30,910
Oh my god.

2100
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,730
Season 3?

2101
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:32,670
Oh, the misery.

2102
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,310
Everybody wants to be my enemy.

2103
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:36,050
Woo!

2104
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:37,810
Are we ready?

2105
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:38,230
Cat chest.

2106
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,570
Weddy.

2107
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,490
I don't know if I wrote ready yet.

2108
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:46,650
Okay, apparently they lost their last game too.

2109
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:49,090
So like, whoever loses this one is the biggest loser.

2110
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:50,430
Yeah.

2111
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:51,370
Guys.

2112
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,290
I don't know if I can handle losing again.

2113
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:58,190
What will happen if you lose, Shore 4?

2114
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:58,990
What will you do?

2115
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,350
The night sky gets angry.

2116
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:01,810
Even the devil shudders.

2117
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:11,590
Guys, we don't want Shore 4 to lose again.

2118
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,590
We don't know what he's gonna be like after.

2119
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:19,590
There's still two teams below you.

2120
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,850
Yes, because we're 1-1.

2121
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:22,810
Wait, that means there's a team that lost every game.

2122
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:24,350
What?

2123
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,150
That's not us though because we had our one already.

2124
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:29,270
We're so ready.

2125
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:30,570
Maybe it was the people that we went against.

2126
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:31,910
The first time.

2127
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:33,410
And maybe we...

2128
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,010
They were just not good at the game.

2129
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,370
And we got false help.

2130
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,670
Look, look.

2131
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,710
This team is...

2132
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,770
This team is a bunch of TikTokers.

2133
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:43,710
Actually, I don't know.

2134
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:44,710
But like...

2135
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,030
Yeah, I only know one TikTok.

2136
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,910
We're just a bunch of VTubers.

2137
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:49,150
So like...

2138
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:49,510
I'm not.

2139
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:50,350
I'm normal.

2140
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:51,850
Sure you are.

2141
01:11:56,790 --> 01:12:00,610
Oh, this one is so hard.

2142
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:01,670
Yeah, yeah.

2143
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:02,510
You're a defense.

2144
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:04,070
Okay.

2145
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:08,710
All right.

2146
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:09,150
Here we go.

2147
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:09,950
We got this.

2148
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:10,550
All right.

2149
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:11,150
It's fine.

2150
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:12,350
I will beat everyone up.

2151
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,930
Wait, one of them is an actual Minecraft player on Joe's team?

2152
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:15,810
What?

2153
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:15,990
What?

2154
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,010
Oh no.

2155
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,950
It's over.

2156
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:17,510
Why?

2157
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:18,910
They have a minecrafter.

2158
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,370
They have a minecrafter.

2159
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:20,770
It's over.

2160
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:23,570
Minecraft speed one.

2161
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:24,730
No.

2162
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:28,810
Okay.

2163
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,830
I'm fucking going in.

2164
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:31,570
I'm going in.

2165
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:31,750
I'm going in.

2166
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,050
I'm going in.

2167
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:33,350
We're blue.

2168
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,870
We're blue.

2169
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:34,930
Oh my god.

2170
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:35,070
Ow!

2171
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:36,310
You fucking punched me.

2172
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,490
I thought you were going in the machine.

2173
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,030
I'm trying.

2174
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,990
No!

2175
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:41,830
I'm in it.

2176
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:42,030
No!

2177
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,170
I got to go down.

2178
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:43,410
Wait.

2179
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:45,790
I thought you were going in ours.

2180
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,010
Who's going in ours?

2181
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:47,850
No.

2182
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,730
I'm doing offense with you.

2183
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:50,130
Oh.

2184
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:51,150
Oh, okay.

2185
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:52,930
And then I'm picking the arcade when I do.

2186
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:57,910
We need people on our machines.

2187
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:01,530
All right.

2188
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,050
We're going in.

2189
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,270
Okay.

2190
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,010
I'm getting in.

2191
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:03,890
I'm getting in.

2192
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:04,330
All right.

2193
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:04,870
You get involved.

2194
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:05,230
You got it.

2195
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:05,690
You get involved.

2196
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:08,030
Wait.

2197
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:08,490
Oh my god.

2198
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,290
We need to stop them though.

2199
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:09,770
Oh god.

2200
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:10,250
Oh god.

2201
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:10,470
Wait.

2202
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:11,210
Who's getting in ours?

2203
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:12,450
Who's supposed to be getting in ours?

2204
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:13,990
I don't know, but I'm...

2205
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:14,850
I think that was Doki.

2206
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,330
No.

2207
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:15,510
Wait.

2208
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:15,650
No.

2209
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:16,450
I said I'm doing offense.

2210
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:18,790
I'm doing offense and I'm doing bears.

2211
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:19,830
That's what I meant.

2212
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:20,130
I'm punching.

2213
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:20,710
I'm punching.

2214
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:21,750
You got it.

2215
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:21,990
You got it.

2216
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:22,470
You got it.

2217
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,630
Yeah, they did.

2218
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:33,150
They did.

2219
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:36,170
I'm trying to grab it so I can get onto the bomb.

2220
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:37,930
Please.

2221
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,010
I'm trying.

2222
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,770
You got it.

2223
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:41,890
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2224
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:42,210
I'm grabbing.

2225
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:42,650
I'm grabbing.

2226
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:43,050
I'm grabbing.

2227
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:43,450
I'm grabbing.

2228
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:43,870
I got it.

2229
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:44,210
I got it.

2230
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:45,490
Wait.

2231
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:46,190
Where am I?

2232
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:46,650
Where am I?

2233
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:46,970
What?

2234
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,450
Oh my god.

2235
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:48,250
They knocked me out.

2236
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:50,630
I punched him out.

2237
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:52,130
We got a bunch.

2238
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:53,150
We got a bunch.

2239
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:55,990
Why would it grab the fucking stick?

2240
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:58,890
I got it.

2241
01:13:58,890 --> 01:13:59,130
I got it.

2242
01:13:59,130 --> 01:13:59,530
I got it.

2243
01:13:59,550 --> 01:13:59,590
I got it.

2244
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:00,790
I got it.

2245
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:00,870
I got it.

2246
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,110
I'm trying to fucking get to the bomb.

2247
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:03,710
Give me the bomb.

2248
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:05,870
You go.

2249
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:06,250
You go.

2250
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:06,450
You go.

2251
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:07,770
I'm trying.

2252
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:08,170
I punched him.

2253
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:10,030
I punched him.

2254
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:10,370
I'm trying to grab.

2255
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:11,970
I punched him.

2256
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:12,370
You go.

2257
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:12,630
You go.

2258
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,010
Okay.

2259
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:13,290
Okay.

2260
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:13,890
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

2261
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:14,030
Wait.

2262
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:14,630
They're going in ours.

2263
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,150
Punch him out.

2264
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:16,190
They got me out.

2265
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:16,790
They got me out.

2266
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:18,450
Okay.

2267
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:19,730
Oh my god.

2268
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:20,490
Give me.

2269
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:20,690
Give me.

2270
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:21,610
I'm gone.

2271
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,050
I'm gone.

2272
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:22,890
I'm on it.

2273
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:23,310
I'm on it.

2274
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,290
I'm passed out.

2275
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:25,350
Okay, we're all passed out.

2276
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:27,410
Wait, you guys haven't grabbed anything.

2277
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,290
We're trying, okay?

2278
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:31,730
Nooo!

2279
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:32,950
They got it!

2280
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:35,610
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

2281
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:36,930
That was my bad.

2282
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,770
You got it.

2283
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:40,390
Nice, nice, nice.

2284
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:41,210
No!

2285
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:42,710
I'm out, I'm out!

2286
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:44,350
Oh my god, he...

2287
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,710
They're so good!

2288
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,370
These are mine right there!

2289
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:50,330
I got some points.

2290
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:50,330
Nice.

2291
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:52,330
I'm trying to grab...

2292
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,910
Grab me the machine, not the stick!

2293
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:54,990
Oh my god!

2294
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:58,550
Oh my god, when you're on it, they can knock you out.

2295
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:59,430
I noticed that.

2296
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:01,730
You don't have a shield when you're on it.

2297
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:02,230
Nice.

2298
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:03,630
Guys, I think it's over.

2299
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,610
Oh, when you're on the enemies.

2300
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:06,810
I think it's over.

2301
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,590
I think it's over.

2302
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:09,230
No, we got it.

2303
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:10,770
I think it's over.

2304
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:11,510
Keep fighting!

2305
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,070
I think it's over.

2306
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:14,210
I'm trying, but...

2307
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,390
I knocked him out, grabbed the stick.

2308
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,330
I'm trying, I knocked out two.

2309
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:17,770
No, he got it!

2310
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:19,290
Nooo!

2311
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:20,310
We got it!

2312
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:20,730
We got it!

2313
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:20,730
We got it!

2314
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:21,310
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

2315
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:24,110
Okay, I'm trying to knock them out!

2316
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:27,190
Tripper, are you knocking them out?

2317
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,110
Of course I am!

2318
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:31,930
I got the bomb!

2319
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,170
I spotted it with the bomb!

2320
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,770
My points!

2321
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:34,250
Nooo!

2322
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:35,650
They got it!

2323
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:36,370
Nooo!

2324
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:37,110
Cheebar.

2325
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,220
It's okay, we have the second round.

2326
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,560
Guys, we have the second round.

2327
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,080
Look, they have a Minecrafter.

2328
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:49,820
Yeah.

2329
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,200
What's the second round?

2330
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,740
The second round is... It's Beast Hockey!

2331
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:57,940
Oh!

2332
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,700
Oh, shit.

2333
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,460
Okay, the hockey... That has ice.

2334
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,260
Okay, I'm really... Lemonade my neck with dripping.

2335
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,880
All I'm gonna do is I'm gonna beat up the goalie.

2336
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:05,820
That's all I'm gonna do.

2337
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,760
I'm just here to beat up the goalie.

2338
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,900
Oh my god, don't be!

2339
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,580
That's supposed to be my...

2340
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,620
That's supposed to be my strat.

2341
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:23,850
Wait, no you don't.

2342
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,570
You're the one to score!

2343
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:29,610
Well, usually when I play these, I only try and grief the enemy team.

2344
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:30,610
Okay, okay.

2345
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,290
But like, are you good at scoring though?

2346
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:34,510
I don't know.

2347
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:40,270
Wait, I'm gonna beat up the goalie and then I'm gonna... I'm gonna steal the shield.

2348
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:42,010
I'll try my best.

2349
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:45,230
I'm gonna steal this shield after.

2350
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,590
Wait, that's... dank dank.

2351
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,770
It's okay.

2352
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,470
Doki, but you're Canadian.

2353
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:58,670
Look, I have very limited knowledge on hockey.

2354
01:16:58,910 --> 01:16:59,970
Other than...

2355
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:01,790
Other than...

2356
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:02,950
the Canucks team.

2357
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:05,910
I played a lot of hockey when I was younger.

2358
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:06,470
Wait!

2359
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,070
Yeah, you're Canadian too!

2360
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:08,890
Sure for it!

2361
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:09,890
You should be the scorer!

2362
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:11,910
I say you're...

2363
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:14,910
I played right side defense when I played hockey.

2364
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:17,830
Oh yeah, today you're gonna be offense today.

2365
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:19,530
I'm offensive.

2366
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:21,810
Okay, don't worry.

2367
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:22,350
I'm going in.

2368
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,970
I'm going in to steal it.

2369
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:25,150
Wait, wait!

2370
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:26,310
I got it out.

2371
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,290
I got it out.

2372
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:28,830
I'm distracting the goalie!

2373
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:31,150
This is your time!

2374
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:32,610
I stole the canuck!

2375
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,270
Sure for it.

2376
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:35,810
What the fuck you want from me?

2377
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:38,890
I literally saved us and then I got knocked out!

2378
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:43,010
What am I supposed to do here?

2379
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,930
All I'm saying is you were the...

2380
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,470
You had the Canadian buff.

2381
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:49,870
Listen, it's not just me.

2382
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:51,150
Remember, 80%...

2383
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,190
Who's our goalie?

2384
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:55,470
It's not me!

2385
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,070
I'm out!

2386
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:56,690
It's not me!

2387
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:56,690
I'm out!

2388
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:57,970
I'm fucking stealing your shield.

2389
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:58,490
Oh no!

2390
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:00,590
We have no goalie!

2391
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:02,330
Oh my offense!

2392
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:03,730
Oh my goalie!

2393
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:06,790
Look!

2394
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:08,750
There's no one there!

2395
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:14,890
The enemy team picked up our shield that they're supposed to use.

2396
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:18,250
The enemy team picked up our shield that they're supposed to use.

2397
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,730
I said I wasn't goalie.

2398
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:21,530
Yes!

2399
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:21,870
Yes!

2400
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:22,030
Yes!

2401
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:22,450
Get it in!

2402
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,290
I'm knocked out!

2403
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,210
I'm knocked out!

2404
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:27,530
I'm knocked out.

2405
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:27,930
I'm out.

2406
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:28,930
I'm out cold.

2407
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:30,030
I'm fucking dead.

2408
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:31,270
Nice!

2409
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:31,850
Nice.

2410
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,150
Winnable.

2411
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:36,490
Yippee!

2412
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:38,930
Yippee!

2413
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:40,170
You idiot!

2414
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:48,490
See, you say I'm offense, but we got 2 on the offensive side.

2415
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:49,490
So I have to play defense!

2416
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,150
Wait, we can have 2 off- offense.

2417
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:54,710
But then we have no defense.

2418
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,630
But then we have no defense.

2419
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:55,970
Oh, wait!

2420
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:56,930
What about the other girls?

2421
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:58,350
What are you trying to say about the other girls?

2422
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:02,350
All I'm saying is I'm the flex right now.

2423
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:04,650
Okay, look.

2424
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,150
I'm getting rid of the goalie right now.

2425
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,390
Okay, look.

2426
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:07,390
I'm getting rid of the goalie right now.

2427
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:09,110
Look, I'm getting rid of the goalie.

2428
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:10,410
The goalie got rid of me though.

2429
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:13,010
The goalie got rid of me though.

2430
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:14,370
I punched him.

2431
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,710
Okay, I'm trying to...

2432
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:18,690
I'm just punching them all out.

2433
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,330
They stole our shield.

2434
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:22,390
I got the shield!

2435
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,990
I'm coming back for you guys!

2436
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:25,350
Oh my god!

2437
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,550
I got the shield for you too!

2438
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:28,590
Uh oh.

2439
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:33,670
Why are you being stealing?

2440
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,750
Ping diff.

2441
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:44,800
I hit you.

2442
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,400
Ow.

2443
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:50,600
It's okay.

2444
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,240
I'm getting my wood.

2445
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,240
This guy is a minecrafter right there.

2446
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,320
What's going on?

2447
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,660
They grabbed our shield.

2448
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:03,680
They grabbed your shield?

2449
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:04,860
Nice!

2450
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,360
Grab the shield back!

2451
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:09,920
It's okay.

2452
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,820
I got the shield!

2453
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,380
They got the shield back.

2454
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:20,300
I knocked that bit out.

2455
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:21,300
Okay.

2456
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,400
Yeah, you can tell this guy is a party animal player.

2457
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:26,500
Ow!

2458
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,400
Oh, I died!

2459
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:28,680
I knocked him out!

2460
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:30,660
Nice!

2461
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,100
I got the goalie!

2462
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,280
And I got the shield!

2463
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,260
Nice!

2464
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:36,660
Nice!

2465
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,620
What is happening to this puff?

2466
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,020
Okay.

2467
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,860
Oh my god.

2468
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:49,800
Nice!

2469
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,200
Okay.

2470
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,440
They are in there for sure.

2471
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,680
Oh, I jumped.

2472
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,000
Yes!

2473
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,460
Guys, this is not looking so good.

2474
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,560
No, no, no, no, this is our comeback.

2475
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,420
This is our comeback.

2476
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:05,840
It's good.

2477
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,460
It's winnable.

2478
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,300
Okay.

2479
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,580
Okay, I'm coming in to actually help.

2480
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:18,240
For real.

2481
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:19,900
Okay!

2482
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:21,020
Yeah, for real this time!

2483
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,920
For real, I'm actually you.

2484
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,240
I shall assist.

2485
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:28,860
Okay.

2486
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,080
I shall use my Canadian debuff.

2487
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,440
That's it, Jill Bart.

2488
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:36,400
You've knocked me out too many times.

2489
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:37,600
Oh my god.

2490
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,160
Oh my god, Yurius now.

2491
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,240
I'm heading over, what do you want me to do?

2492
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:44,960
I'm literally here!

2493
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:47,900
You- Oh no!

2494
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:48,900
No!

2495
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:48,940
No!

2496
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,300
Nice one!

2497
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,500
You hit me twice!

2498
01:21:52,580 --> 01:22:00,920
I set that up for you man.

2499
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,680
Yeah, and I knocked out two of them mufuckas.

2500
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,600
Okay, I'm waiting for the pass.

2501
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,580
Oh, not that middle.

2502
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:19,880
Yes.

2503
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,240
Oh no!

2504
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,800
Oh shit!

2505
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:26,980
Oh shit, I almost knocked you out.

2506
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,320
Oh, he's- Nice!

2507
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,300
Nice!

2508
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,170
It's a party animal.

2509
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:42,530
Guys, I got some bad news.

2510
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:43,730
They only need one more.

2511
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:47,450
Oh guys, guys, surely, surely we can come back.

2512
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:48,850
It's a comeback right here, right?

2513
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,710
Okay, this is getting hard bullying though.

2514
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:53,630
It's a comeback, it's a comeback.

2515
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:55,770
It's so wittable.

2516
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:57,030
It's so wittable.

2517
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:58,790
It's the comeback of the century.

2518
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:00,710
This is it.

2519
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:02,550
Punch me in the chin.

2520
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:04,510
Oh shit, our goalie's down.

2521
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:05,650
Our goalie's down.

2522
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:08,050
Okay.

2523
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:09,870
Oh, I'm down!

2524
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:22,510
This is just a round robin.

2525
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,410
We're not last because we won our one game.

2526
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:25,890
That's all that matters.

2527
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,370
That's true, we're not last.

2528
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:28,330
We're not last.

2529
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:31,450
Does that mean we progress or are we out?

2530
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:34,770
No, we have- this was a round robin so then we have seeded after this.

2531
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,250
Then it's like single- We're just gonna be seeded with the losers.

2532
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:39,310
That's like single elimination, I think.

2533
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:42,330
It's single elimination after this.

2534
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:43,570
Which is good!

2535
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:46,410
We purposely lost so we can get easier games.

2536
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:48,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2537
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,890
That's not- Madoki, I have some bad news for you.

2538
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:52,010
That's not how seeding works.

2539
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:59,530
If you're last, that means you go against- that means you go against top seed, which means you go against the hardest of them.

2540
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,750
No, that's not how that works.

2541
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:03,550
There's no way.

2542
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:06,050
No, no.

2543
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:07,830
Where did you get those rules?

2544
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,070
Who told you that?

2545
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,570
I was your pro player.

2546
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,890
Who told you- you were a pro player.

2547
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:14,650
I played professional video games.

2548
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,210
You were a pro player, but times have changed.

2549
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,410
Times have not changed.

2550
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:22,370
Maybe in the VTuber world, but this is the Twitch Rivals.

2551
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:22,910
Times have changed.

2552
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:25,290
This is the Twitch Rivals.

2553
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,170
It's not VTuber exclusive.

2554
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:33,210
Okay, but like, why would they put us in the- Why would they put us in the harder queues when we're losing?

2555
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:34,010
Wake up to reality.

2556
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,250
Everything goes right in this accursed world.

2557
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:38,530
No, but things are supposed to go right!

2558
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:43,070
It's supposed to be our world!

2559
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,450
Crying emoji.

2560
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:46,310
Okay.

2561
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:49,470
How is the seeding?

2562
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:50,410
Okay, second stage.

2563
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:51,250
Single elimination.

2564
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,370
Best of three games.

2565
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:55,850
First to three points.

2566
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:58,030
Oh, it's first to three points.

2567
01:24:58,150 --> 01:24:58,610
Oh, okay.

2568
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,590
Wait, but it doesn't even tell- Oh!

2569
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:06,550
Is this just beat-em-up?

2570
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:07,970
Or quarterfinals?

2571
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:10,710
Conveyor, trebuchet, wind tunnel.

2572
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:12,410
Oh, no.

2573
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:13,030
What's conveyor?

2574
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,090
Oh, god, wait.

2575
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:16,950
What is conveyor?

2576
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:18,410
Shrug.

2577
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:20,210
What is conveyor?

2578
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,150
What is conveyor, guys?

2579
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:26,210
What is this?

2580
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:28,950
Oh, it's a big conveyor.

2581
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:31,550
Yeah, but is it like PvP?

2582
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:34,750
Yeah, Last Stand is like PvP.

2583
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,210
You have to dump people off.

2584
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:39,570
Um, like there's a bunch of weapons that spawn in.

2585
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:42,530
And then you pick them up and then you dump them off the side.

2586
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:42,850
Oh!

2587
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:43,370
Okay.

2588
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,490
So, hopefully this should be good.

2589
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:47,710
Yeah.

2590
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:48,850
Because it's just beating people up.

2591
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:51,290
Yeah, yeah, hopefully that'll be easy, right?

2592
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:53,030
Yeah.

2593
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:54,610
I love beating people up.

2594
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:55,470
Yeah.

2595
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:56,470
See, that's good.

2596
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:01,870
I'm buying earth runes right now.

2597
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:02,950
Hopefully.

2598
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:06,190
We got this.

2599
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,270
You're min-mining again?

2600
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,050
Yeah.

2601
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:11,690
Okay, back to my dailies.

2602
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:14,630
Back to your dailies?

2603
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:16,230
Free entertain us!

2604
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:18,770
I'm playing Neopets!

2605
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:19,850
Entertain us!

2606
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,350
I got more core stuff to do!

2607
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,770
People still play Neopets?

2608
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:31,850
Yeah, they like recently uh, they recently sold Neopets to uh, some tech guy who is like a Neopets fan.

2609
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:33,490
Yeah.

2610
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:34,830
And then they're rebuilding.

2611
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:39,410
Yeah, they're rebuilding the uh, they're rebuilding the...

2612
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,330
Does it still look like it was made in 2001?

2613
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:42,990
No, it's...

2614
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:44,350
Oh, okay.

2615
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:47,090
It looks like it was made in like 2012.

2616
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:48,650
Huh.

2617
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:50,510
They upgraded it a little bit.

2618
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:51,430
Huh.

2619
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,390
Huh.

2620
01:26:54,950 --> 01:27:04,150
I know like, I know they're trying to do like something uh, I know they're trying to do like some updates to it.

2621
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:05,930
And adding new game modes.

2622
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:06,890
Yeah, no they're doing a lot.

2623
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:08,890
Like they're doing events and stuff finally.

2624
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,830
And they brought back unconverted pets.

2625
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:13,150
Which is amazing.

2626
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,530
Oh yeah, I remember that!

2627
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:15,070
Yeah.

2628
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,150
I remember that.

2629
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:20,150
Because they sent like a fucking newsletter out to everybody about it.

2630
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:20,570
Yeah!

2631
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:25,830
I'm autistic enough that I cried when they brought back unconverted pets.

2632
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:30,090
Yeah, because then you can like, you people were like selling it for like crazy amount of real money.

2633
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:31,710
It was like hundreds of dollars.

2634
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:36,970
If you could get a Pokemon, or a Pokemon, a Neopet with like a good name, it was genuinely hundreds of dollars.

2635
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:47,370
It was like, yeah, and I remember like you can actually buy like real Neopoints and like real paintbrushes like and stuff with real fucking money.

2636
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:48,550
Yeah.

2637
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,050
Wait, did you actually cry?

2638
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:53,630
Yeah, no, because I'm autistic.

2639
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:57,930
That wasn't a joke.

2640
01:27:57,970 --> 01:27:59,630
I was just, you know, you know.

2641
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:01,430
I got a fairy sweet talk.

2642
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:05,030
Little like seven year old Brie was really happy, okay?

2643
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:10,430
I was living a really good life.

2644
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:13,690
Yeah, I miss Neopets.

2645
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,930
I used to like grind that game as if it was a fucking job.

2646
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:18,690
Dude, same.

2647
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,130
When I was like really young.

2648
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:21,410
Because like that was my life.

2649
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:22,990
Oh yeah, when I was young too.

2650
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:26,090
I did Neopet dailies.

2651
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:29,630
Just like how people today do Genshin dailies.

2652
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:30,970
And Honkai dailies.

2653
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:31,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2654
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:33,650
I did that when I was a child.

2655
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:36,830
And there was like a website called SunnyNeo or something.

2656
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:37,910
SunnyNeo!

2657
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:41,890
And they would have like a checklist of like here's some stuff you have to do every day.

2658
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:46,530
And then I would click every link every day to make sure I get my dailies done.

2659
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:47,970
Yeah, yeah.

2660
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:48,730
Neopets was my gacha.

2661
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:49,890
Yes, but it was free.

2662
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:54,470
The only time I was spending was, the only thing I was spending was my time.

2663
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:57,570
Time is...

2664
01:28:57,570 --> 01:28:59,210
Time is money.

2665
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,750
I was not spending actual money.

2666
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:07,210
I didn't get scammed into doing the whole, what was it?

2667
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:10,290
The Neopets exclusive shit.

2668
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:13,430
Doki is just hurting my feelings right now.

2669
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:15,050
Neopets premium?

2670
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,210
Yeah, imagine spending money on Neopets premium.

2671
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:18,830
I didn't spend real money on that.

2672
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,350
That's wild.

2673
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,490
Imagine spending money on this game.

2674
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:31,770
Imagine spending money on Neomall and Neopets premium for the super wizard just cause you wanted to like search up the lowest prices.

2675
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:33,790
Yeah.

2676
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:35,790
It's not worth your time.

2677
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:36,330
That's crazy.

2678
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:37,190
Is it?

2679
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:40,210
I don't know what the hell is going on.

2680
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:44,630
Doki is hurting my feelings and making fun of my spending choices.

2681
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,390
That's what's happening.

2682
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:47,850
That's sick.

2683
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:49,770
Oh my god.

2684
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:51,110
Look I got priorities okay.

2685
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:52,930
My priorities are very stupid.

2686
01:29:53,450 --> 01:29:54,470
Oh my god.

2687
01:29:54,510 --> 01:30:04,430
You know like when we were fighting at Joe's team a bunch of his... I don't know if it was happening in your chat but a bunch of his chatters came to my chat just to like cheer for Joe.

2688
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:05,850
Really?

2689
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:07,030
That's funny.

2690
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:08,650
What supportive guys.

2691
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:12,650
And then when we lost we were like Yeah!

2692
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:13,670
Joe's better!

2693
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:16,430
And I was like what the fuck?

2694
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:17,970
Happy little guys.

2695
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:26,830
Got to tone down that happiness there to their own chat.

2696
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:30,890
Chat hoppers.

2697
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:33,370
Yeah.

2698
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:34,610
Preview!

2699
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:37,310
That's true.

2700
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:39,650
That's true.

2701
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:42,750
It's not showing up with the map.

2702
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:44,450
What?

2703
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:44,990
What do you mean?

2704
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:47,050
The new game.

2705
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:47,950
It's not showing up.

2706
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,990
New game?

2707
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:49,930
Oh the quarter finals?

2708
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:51,350
Oh shit the quarter finals!

2709
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:52,090
Yeah!

2710
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:52,630
Quarter finals!

2711
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:53,730
Who played against these people?

2712
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:55,070
ZuriSparks.

2713
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,410
No they're all new people.

2714
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:56,810
Nice.

2715
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,150
Alright if we lose this we're out.

2716
01:30:58,350 --> 01:30:59,330
Just so you guys know.

2717
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:04,390
It is life or death for real.

2718
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,110
It feels so good.

2719
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,610
It's life or death.

2720
01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:11,330
Right here.

2721
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,230
Wait it is not showing up.

2722
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:14,110
Right here.

2723
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:14,630
Yeah it's not.

2724
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:15,470
I thought you were lying.

2725
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:18,530
Why would I be lying?

2726
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:20,010
I thought you were lying about this.

2727
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:21,130
Compulsive liar.

2728
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:23,910
I know because you're about your resume.

2729
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:26,470
I'm sorry.

2730
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:27,630
You saw that first round.

2731
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:29,510
I carried at least two things to the end.

2732
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:31,790
Did we see that second and third round?

2733
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:34,390
I think that was it.

2734
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:35,890
I'm just being held back.

2735
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:37,950
You're being held back by who?

2736
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:40,690
Name names right now!

2737
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:41,490
Who is it?

2738
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:43,850
I don't really want to.

2739
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:44,570
Who is it?

2740
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:45,730
Not to cause any drama.

2741
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:52,910
But I'm just saying that I'm not being let let you know show my true skill in this game.

2742
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:54,010
Um...

2743
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:00,570
Why is it not showing up?

2744
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:01,710
I wanna join.

2745
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:04,810
I wanna be part.

2746
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:08,910
Still not created yet.

2747
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:09,470
Oh...

2748
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:14,510
We... okay team Squeaks and team Joe are against each other.

2749
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:16,790
So if we win this we might have to go against Joe again.

2750
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:17,910
Joe?

2751
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,590
Joe Mama.

2752
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:19,410
Okay.

2753
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:22,470
That's weird.

2754
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:23,910
I haven't seen it yet.

2755
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:26,390
Alright somebody send this guy a friend ID.

2756
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:29,050
And I will invite you.

2757
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:30,970
And then Bri you...

2758
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,630
You give your friend ID there.

2759
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,110
And then invite us.

2760
01:32:35,630 --> 01:32:35,670
Okay.

2761
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:37,510
Copy.

2762
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:41,590
Oh apparently the room is not showable.

2763
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:45,170
So like they have to invite us individually with the friend ID.

2764
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:46,890
So like they have to invite us individually with the friend ID.

2765
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:47,190
What the?

2766
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:47,730
What the?

2767
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:51,930
So we just gotta wait.

2768
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:54,370
Just gotta wait.

2769
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:55,390
Just gotta wait.

2770
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:58,250
The first one to die is Deadweight.

2771
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:03,730
All right everyone makes sure Doki dies last.

2772
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:04,050
What?

2773
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:05,370
What?

2774
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,030
I'm the captain I can't be Deadweight!

2775
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:09,790
I'm the captain I can't be Deadweight!

2776
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,490
Captains are usually the Deadweight.

2777
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:12,670
I literally Scored.

2778
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:15,530
I was the only person that Scored.

2779
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:19,710
I'm a charismatic person to bring people together, not to actually do anything.

2780
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:21,090
It's like a CEO.

2781
01:33:22,450 --> 01:33:25,170
Okay, okay, but I actually did stuff.

2782
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:28,690
Keep telling yourself that.

2783
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:33,010
Oh yeah, the first game, the first game, I scored almost all the goals in the first game.

2784
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:34,950
And who set up those scores?

2785
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:39,430
The second game, I scored the only goal in the second game.

2786
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:40,010
That was luck.

2787
01:33:40,410 --> 01:33:41,770
I also kicked it forward.

2788
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:43,070
I knocked two people out.

2789
01:33:43,070 --> 01:33:44,070
I knocked two people out.

2790
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:47,150
Game three, I set up the goal for you.

2791
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:50,690
I knocked two people out before you set it up.

2792
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:54,450
See, this is the self-centered thinking we're talking about here.

2793
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:57,330
This is team games, but you're only thinking about what you do.

2794
01:33:57,330 --> 01:34:00,950
Yeah, but you're self-centered as well because you were telling people that you did all that stuff as well.

2795
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:05,010
You told us that you were 80% of the team last which round.

2796
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:05,410
I'm just saying, my piece of the story.

2797
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:06,150
My story matters.

2798
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:16,250
What is this friend ID?

2799
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:18,530
It's in your fucking profile.

2800
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:20,590
In Party Atlas.

2801
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:22,010
Oh!

2802
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:26,110
Are they just waiting for us?

2803
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,770
Where are you?

2804
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:29,790
Where is this room?

2805
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:32,850
So am I.

2806
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:34,650
What do they want?

2807
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,150
It's in the...

2808
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:40,130
Calm down, try again.

2809
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:43,050
Oh god, I've been searching for you.

2810
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:43,830
I've been searching for you for too long.

2811
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,510
You told me to calm down.

2812
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:49,970
What the...

2813
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,360
Do I just like...

2814
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,320
add someone to like...

2815
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,120
wait to get invited?

2816
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,420
Yeah, we have to like...

2817
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:10,980
We have to wait for Bri to get in and then she's gonna invite us in a vid...

2818
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,600
She's gonna invite me and then I'll invite you too.

2819
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:14,520
Okay.

2820
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:16,800
Okay, accept.

2821
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:19,880
Woah!

2822
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:21,940
Okay.

2823
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:22,940
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

2824
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:26,660
Oh wait.

2825
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,160
Do I have to add you guys?

2826
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:28,840
Oh no.

2827
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,020
Guys.

2828
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,180
Just add me.

2829
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:34,700
Guys.

2830
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,220
Did you add me?

2831
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,500
I did it on Party Animals.

2832
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:40,560
I did it.

2833
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,800
Yo, one new game friend?

2834
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,220
I said that.

2835
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,360
I have friends.

2836
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:47,620
Thank you.

2837
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:49,140
Yay!

2838
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:50,360
Okay, I sent a new mic to everyone.

2839
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:50,720
Okay.

2840
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:55,420
I'm here to slay.

2841
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:55,440
I'm here to slay.

2842
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:56,600
Where should we slot?

2843
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,520
Yeah, the last... it's the beat up.

2844
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:01,500
Oh, okay.

2845
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,380
It's a beat em up.

2846
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:04,080
How come we couldn't find this lobby?

2847
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:04,860
Like, what the fuck?

2848
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:05,900
I don't know.

2849
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:08,440
Oh, it's because you didn't put the space dash.

2850
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:09,140
Oh!

2851
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:11,840
That makes sense.

2852
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,280
I just clicked the R and I couldn't find it.

2853
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,900
I literally copied and pasted this.

2854
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,120
So that's why I'm there.

2855
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:18,160
Well yeah, because in the copy paste it was...

2856
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:18,460
Okay.

2857
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,040
There's no space bar.

2858
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:21,840
Oh!

2859
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:25,820
Okay, so all we do is beat em up.

2860
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,220
And then throw them out.

2861
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,120
Are you guys gonna throw things?

2862
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:29,820
Yeah.

2863
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,040
I'm going on the sauce.

2864
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:31,500
Alright.

2865
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:33,440
Whoever dies first is a dead weight.

2866
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,980
I'm knocking Doki Bird out.

2867
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:37,140
What?!

2868
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:42,100
How could you do this to the captain?

2869
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,480
How could you do this?

2870
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,640
I can't believe you've done this.

2871
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:46,460
I can't believe it.

2872
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:48,360
We're a team.

2873
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:51,160
I got a bomb.

2874
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:52,920
That's not cool.

2875
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:53,960
Oh my god.

2876
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:55,140
I didn't get anybody.

2877
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:57,960
Get up!

2878
01:36:58,300 --> 01:36:58,300
Get up!

2879
01:36:58,300 --> 01:36:58,640
Get up!

2880
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:58,900
Get up!

2881
01:36:59,180 --> 01:36:59,500
Get up!

2882
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,540
Get up!

2883
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:02,900
Get up!

2884
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:04,640
Get up!

2885
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:05,460
Get up!

2886
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:05,640
Get up!

2887
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:05,720
Get up!

2888
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:05,900
Get up!

2889
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,140
Get up!

2890
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:06,180
Get up!

2891
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:06,400
Get up!

2892
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:06,940
Wait.

2893
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:08,480
I'm good.

2894
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:11,680
Wait.

2895
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,360
How do I get up?

2896
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:13,360
Wait.

2897
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:13,740
How do I?

2898
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,660
Oh, it's so hard when you're on the side.

2899
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:16,780
I don't know how to get up this.

2900
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:17,080
Okay.

2901
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:18,180
It's up to you guys.

2902
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:18,620
I'm out.

2903
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:20,620
Oh my Doki!

2904
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:21,400
Wait.

2905
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,420
Were you the first one out?

2906
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:22,880
No.

2907
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:23,320
Ditto was.

2908
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,040
Ditto was.

2909
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:24,760
Me.

2910
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:25,720
Ditto was.

2911
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:26,320
No.

2912
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:28,300
I got my one.

2913
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,360
I got my one.

2914
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,300
I thought Ditto would fucking walk off the conveyor.

2915
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:37,020
Okay.

2916
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:38,260
I'm alive.

2917
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:38,720
I'm alive.

2918
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:38,980
I'm alive.

2919
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:39,320
No.

2920
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:39,620
No.

2921
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:39,720
No.

2922
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:40,160
Hold on.

2923
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:40,720
No.

2924
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:41,720
No.

2925
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,340
Oh my god.

2926
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:42,840
Did she not?

2927
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:43,500
Did that happen?

2928
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:44,380
Okay.

2929
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:44,640
Wait.

2930
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:44,800
Wait.

2931
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,100
I'm throwing bombs.

2932
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:47,460
I'm throwing bombs for you guys.

2933
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:49,780
Uh oh.

2934
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:50,260
Uh oh.

2935
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:50,740
Never mind.

2936
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:52,040
I might be dead.

2937
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:53,400
Oh no.

2938
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:53,600
No.

2939
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:53,720
No.

2940
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,700
This is the end.

2941
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:54,780
No.

2942
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:54,780
No.

2943
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:55,000
No.

2944
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,460
This is the end.

2945
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:55,660
Oh wait.

2946
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:55,880
Wait.

2947
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:56,000
Wait.

2948
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:56,320
Guys.

2949
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:56,620
You're okay.

2950
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,420
You're okay.

2951
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:58,820
You're okay.

2952
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,220
I'm dead.

2953
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,000
No.

2954
01:38:01,260 --> 01:38:01,660
No.

2955
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:02,920
Free.

2956
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:03,540
This is it.

2957
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:04,240
This is on you.

2958
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:04,920
This is.

2959
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,060
It's only me.

2960
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,300
This is all on you.

2961
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:08,860
Okay.

2962
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:09,340
Goodbye.

2963
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:09,800
Oh no.

2964
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:10,380
Oh no.

2965
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:10,800
Goodbye.

2966
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:12,160
Goodbye.

2967
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:14,000
I throw a banana.

2968
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:14,920
Oh no.

2969
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:15,220
Oh no.

2970
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:15,360
Oh no.

2971
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:15,680
Oh no.

2972
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:15,960
Oh no.

2973
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,220
That was their one.

2974
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:28,500
I entirely missed.

2975
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:30,460
Free.

2976
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,520
I'm scared.

2977
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:34,440
No.

2978
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:37,400
Uh oh.

2979
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,140
Save me.

2980
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,000
No.

2981
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:39,320
No.

2982
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:39,520
No.

2983
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:39,680
No.

2984
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:39,840
No.

2985
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:39,940
No.

2986
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:40,360
No shot.

2987
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,500
What happened.

2988
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,660
What happened.

2989
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:46,890
What happened shrimpfire.

2990
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,150
This is your game.

2991
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:49,230
Honestly.

2992
01:38:49,450 --> 01:38:50,230
This iscaped it.

2993
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:50,370
Wait.

2994
01:38:50,370 --> 01:38:50,470
You're done for.

2995
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:52,870
Yeah, this is pinged it.

2996
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:54,690
Oh, I fell off!

2997
01:38:56,590 --> 01:38:57,970
Alright guys, it's up to you.

2998
01:38:58,010 --> 01:38:58,390
Good luck.

2999
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:00,070
Guys...

3000
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:05,530
When I heard I fell off and I'm the only one here now, I'm scared.

3001
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,270
No, you got Ditto.

3002
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:08,030
Ditto's there.

3003
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:09,010
Oh, Ditto, you're still alive?

3004
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:10,970
Oh my gosh!

3005
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:12,970
Ditto, are you still alive?

3006
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:14,950
Yeah.

3007
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:16,550
I don't know how to jump off this one.

3008
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:17,510
What do you mean?

3009
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:18,690
He just had to keep jumping.

3010
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:20,410
Oh, not that way!

3011
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:21,230
That's all!

3012
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:23,610
Now you're the only one.

3013
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:24,430
Okay, now I'm still here.

3014
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:25,650
Wait, what?

3015
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:28,470
What do you mean?

3016
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:30,830
Now you're the only one.

3017
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:32,230
They're all coming after me!

3018
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:34,210
Hey, freaking kill them.

3019
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:36,570
I don't know.

3020
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:38,070
I don't know, guys.

3021
01:39:39,950 --> 01:39:40,470
Bumba.

3022
01:39:40,570 --> 01:39:41,750
Oh, yup.

3023
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:46,710
You just gotta put in the fucking montage.

3024
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:49,730
Oh my gosh.

3025
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:51,110
This is the comeback.

3026
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:53,030
I got knocked out instantly.

3027
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:54,010
I don't know, guys.

3028
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:55,290
You just pushed me!

3029
01:39:55,610 --> 01:39:58,610
I would take one guy with me.

3030
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:01,410
You took one guy with you?

3031
01:40:01,450 --> 01:40:01,710
Hell yeah!

3032
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:04,510
Guys, I can't get back up.

3033
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:04,970
Oh, I can.

3034
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:06,010
Okay.

3035
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:10,330
Okay, I'm gonna try and kill him and then I'm gonna take him down with me as well.

3036
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:12,390
Yeah, me too.

3037
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:13,390
That's my plan now.

3038
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:15,970
No!

3039
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,130
Oh my god, he's growing!

3040
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:19,210
He has the spinach!

3041
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:22,970
He has the spinach.

3042
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:23,750
I'm a little scared.

3043
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:25,830
Oh.

3044
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:26,990
Jump.

3045
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:30,650
Oh no!

3046
01:40:31,330 --> 01:40:32,130
I heal you.

3047
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:33,030
Help me!

3048
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:33,350
Thank you!

3049
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:36,110
My hero academia.

3050
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:37,710
Oh my god.

3051
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:39,030
Oh no.

3052
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,060
I'm trying to get back up.

3053
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,420
How do you get back up?

3054
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:47,300
Oh, there you go.

3055
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,080
Guys, I'm struggling!

3056
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:53,660
If you jump kick, I think it's more of a chance to get up.

3057
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,100
Oh really?

3058
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:54,380
Okay.

3059
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,320
That's good to know.

3060
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:56,860
That's good to know.

3061
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:57,580
Oh no!

3062
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,560
Oh, now there's three.

3063
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,520
Oh god.

3064
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:05,640
I'm in.

3065
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,040
I'm in.

3066
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:06,960
I'm in.

3067
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:12,520
Nice, Doki.

3068
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,960
Not nice anymore.

3069
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,160
Not nice anymore.

3070
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:15,280
Oh no!

3071
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,480
How does that one hit not hit him off?

3072
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:20,120
No!

3073
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:21,320
It's up to Ditto!

3074
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,040
Wait, no.

3075
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:23,520
Ditto's dead.

3076
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:23,800
Okay.

3077
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:24,920
Nice.

3078
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,580
Hey guys, I think...

3079
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:30,120
Look, I got my one.

3080
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,540
Guys, I got my one.

3081
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:33,820
What were you guys doing?

3082
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:34,840
Who got their ones?

3083
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,120
I got my five.

3084
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:38,820
You did not get five.

3085
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,300
Only two people fucking died in that entire time.

3086
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,160
Yeah, I got five.

3087
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:46,280
You did not get five.

3088
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,460
You missed my clutch guardian angel save.

3089
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,760
No, that was amazing.

3090
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:54,360
Yeah, but you guys died regardless so does it matter?

3091
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,000
Listen, what's more important in life?

3092
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:58,400
Saving someone or killing someone?

3093
01:41:58,620 --> 01:41:59,440
That's what I thought.

3094
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:08,380
Well, if that person you're killing is gonna end up fucking going to jail anyway for committing murder, then like killing them is a better deal.

3095
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,280
You heard it here.

3096
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,900
Doki thinks murder is justifiable.

3097
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,200
Yeah, if you're murdering another murderer.

3098
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:28,990
If you're gonna stop and cry, if that person is gonna commit multiple murders and you murdered them before they commit multiple murders, then it's justifiable.

3099
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:30,610
It's like coming back in time.

3100
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:35,290
What if that person was about to murder someone who murdered their child?

3101
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:41,670
Well, what if that child grows up to commit more murders and he was like a time traveler?

3102
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:44,810
Uh oh.

3103
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:46,130
Yeah, I think that sounds logic.

3104
01:42:46,190 --> 01:42:47,190
Yeah, that makes sense.

3105
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:49,210
You heard it here.

3106
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:53,010
Doki said it's fine to murder children so they don't become evil.

3107
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:54,570
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3108
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:57,090
No, no, no, no, no.

3109
01:42:57,170 --> 01:43:02,750
I'm saying that child ends up going out to becoming a murderer.

3110
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:04,870
Therefore, there will be no problems.

3111
01:43:05,010 --> 01:43:09,470
I'm saying if that murderer was a time traveler who knows the future of what that child is going to do.

3112
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:12,830
It's like if you have the power to time travel, we travel back in time.

3113
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:13,470
Your logic is flawed.

3114
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:14,990
You know how your logic is flawed?

3115
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:17,510
Because if there's time travel, it would already happen by now.

3116
01:43:17,830 --> 01:43:18,910
Yeah, because it's a paradox.

3117
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:23,690
What if they created a multiverse so that it drifts off to a separate multiverse?

3118
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:24,130
Multiverse!

3119
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:24,850
I love Marvel!

3120
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:25,570
Yeah.

3121
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:28,690
Yo, someone pull the trigger.

3122
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:29,510
I'm going in deep.

3123
01:43:29,730 --> 01:43:30,430
Go, go in.

3124
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:31,990
Oh, no, I'm stuck.

3125
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:32,950
I'm pulling.

3126
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:34,390
Go in.

3127
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:35,890
Yeah.

3128
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:39,210
Okay, then we have to...

3129
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:39,850
Oh, they're here!

3130
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:40,170
They're here!

3131
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:40,870
That fucking bomb!

3132
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:43,190
We gotta take them out!

3133
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:47,030
No!

3134
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:47,870
Hey, they're chucking!

3135
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:48,610
Oh, no!

3136
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:49,810
What happened?

3137
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:52,710
All of our stuff got destroyed.

3138
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:53,330
No!

3139
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,190
We gotta make sure we got...

3140
01:43:56,190 --> 01:43:57,350
I'm bringing the bombs over!

3141
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:59,730
Just keep putting bombs in.

3142
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:00,390
Yeah.

3143
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:05,430
Get the bombs!

3144
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:06,030
Oh my god!

3145
01:44:06,090 --> 01:44:06,690
Throw them off!

3146
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:07,210
Throw them off!

3147
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:09,170
No!

3148
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:10,790
Throw them off!

3149
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:17,770
I made one bomb go off.

3150
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:18,810
I made one bomb go off.

3151
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:20,590
I dragged it down!

3152
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:21,470
I dragged it down with me!

3153
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:23,110
You're gonna die with me!

3154
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:26,670
You're gonna die with me if it's the last thing I do!

3155
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:28,030
Goodbye!

3156
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:29,710
Oh my god.

3157
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:32,330
I spawned back into my own base.

3158
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:34,570
Oh my god.

3159
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:36,810
Oh my god.

3160
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:37,650
Oh my god.

3161
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:38,610
Go on the other side!

3162
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:39,250
Get the bomb!

3163
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:39,690
Get the bomb!

3164
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:40,410
Go do it!

3165
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:41,970
Yeah!

3166
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:43,290
I'm back.

3167
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:43,810
I'm back.

3168
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:44,930
I'm bringing the bomb over.

3169
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:48,190
Oh, sweet, sweet, sweet.

3170
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,490
That's me.

3171
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:48,690
That's me.

3172
01:44:48,690 --> 01:44:48,930
That's me.

3173
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:51,910
Take them over!

3174
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:52,550
No!

3175
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:53,410
Oh no.

3176
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:54,290
He jumped over.

3177
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:55,030
He's over.

3178
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:55,310
He's over.

3179
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:57,490
I got crushed.

3180
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:00,410
Put the bombs in!

3181
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,950
Put the bombs in!

3182
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:04,420
I'm coming!

3183
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:04,780
I'm coming!

3184
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:05,080
I'm coming!

3185
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:07,580
Oh, they sent two people over.

3186
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:08,480
It's okay.

3187
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:08,860
I'm back.

3188
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:26,350
Ow!

3189
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:27,170
That's me, Ditto.

3190
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:27,870
That's me!

3191
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:29,390
Ditto, that's me!

3192
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:30,970
Kill me!

3193
01:45:31,850 --> 01:45:32,250
Okay.

3194
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:34,170
Hey, we're not doing too good.

3195
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:35,010
I got the bomb over.

3196
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:35,750
I got the bomb over.

3197
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:37,790
Take the bomb and do it!

3198
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:37,950
Come in!

3199
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:38,790
Come in!

3200
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:38,950
Oh,

3201
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,660
he caught me with the bomb!

3202
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,100
What

3203
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:56,550
did you guys do?

3204
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:59,830
Uh, the bombs went off.

3205
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:01,790
Guys, are we?

3206
01:46:02,130 --> 01:46:03,030
I think we're out.

3207
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:05,110
I think we're out, guys.

3208
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:08,110
Guys, we're not last.

3209
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:08,930
We got one win.

3210
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:10,150
We got one win.

3211
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:12,510
Oh!

3212
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:15,070
I can't feed my kid!

3213
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:16,270
No!

3214
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,230
Poki's gonna kill my child!

3215
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:23,850
Your future child.

3216
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:33,810
Look, we're not last because we won our one game.

3217
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:42,050
Yeah, we got that very first game and we got high egos and then we... failed miserably the rest of the time.

3218
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:42,690
One more game!

3219
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:49,210
We did the best we could!

3220
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:49,630
We could.

3221
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:54,230
For every winner there has to be a loser.

3222
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:55,150
Starting map three!

3223
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:56,930
Oh wait!

3224
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:58,210
One to one.

3225
01:46:58,430 --> 01:46:58,990
Not GG's?

3226
01:46:59,130 --> 01:46:59,570
Yes.

3227
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:00,090
No.

3228
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:01,470
One to one.

3229
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:01,750
Wait.

3230
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:01,750
Yeah.

3231
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:03,890
Don't eat me!

3232
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:04,550
Don't eat me!

3233
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:16,500
Question mark?

3234
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:36,390
These guys on the enemy team don't know what the fuck's going on.

3235
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:55,440
I'm like Rumpelstiltskin.

3236
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:02,540
It's okay.

3237
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:06,580
It's all about the friends we made along the way.

3238
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:07,220
Yeah.

3239
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,040
Right guys?

3240
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:09,700
Yeah.

3241
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:11,440
Yeah.

3242
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:11,680
Yeah.

3243
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:21,840
I'm so excited now in the future if someone asks me to play I could just say, oh yeah, no, we won some games on Twitch Rivals and I can lie even more about my resume.

3244
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:22,620
I'm so excited.

3245
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:24,960
I got to play with the legendary Pussy Slayer.

3246
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:25,740
Yeah, yeah.

3247
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:26,340
That's done.

3248
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:27,280
Done here.

3249
01:48:30,120 --> 01:48:32,580
I got my Warp Scepter during all this.

3250
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,140
That's a dub.

3251
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:34,700
It's alright.

3252
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:35,380
It's okay.

3253
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:37,700
In the end everybody gets money.

3254
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:38,520
Guys.

3255
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:40,520
Everybody wins.

3256
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,680
Everybody gets money and that's what it's all about.

3257
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:43,220
Everybody wins something.

3258
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:43,900
That's right.

3259
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:45,260
That's right.

3260
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,480
Everybody wins something.

3261
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:49,440
That's all that matters.

3262
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:50,080
Let's kick this out.

3263
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:51,340
Exactly guys.

3264
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:52,100
Exactly.

3265
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:54,420
Well, GG is everybody.

3266
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:55,980
What a journey.

3267
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:56,060
GG.

3268
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:56,980
We're the first one out.

3269
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:57,880
Okay, GG.

3270
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:58,580
No, no, no, no.

3271
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:02,100
There's been a team that lost every game and that's not our team.

3272
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:05,240
Yeah, but they still they were in the quarter finals.

3273
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:05,880
That's not our team.

3274
01:49:06,120 --> 01:49:07,400
That's not our team.

3275
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,360
There was a team that lost every game.

3276
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:11,940
But that wasn't us.

3277
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,200
Okay, that's all that matters.

3278
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:17,160
That's all that matters.

3279
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:19,620
GG's everybody.

3280
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:21,840
GG's.

3281
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:23,040
GG guys.

3282
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,700
Good luck with the rest of your day guys.

3283
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,500
See you next time.

3284
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:26,120
Bye bye.

3285
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:27,780
Bye bye.

3286
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:31,580
Alright, I had a great time.

3287
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,060
I had a fun time with everyone.

3288
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:42,620
It was honestly a huge blast playing with this team.

3289
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,860
And we had a fun time with this team as well.

3290
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,160
There's been some...

3291
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:50,580
I feel like on Twitch things just get much more cursed in general.

3292
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:55,000
It's just the Twitch life.

3293
01:49:59,040 --> 01:49:59,960
Anyway guys.

3294
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:01,440
It's okay.

3295
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:02,940
We won our first game.

3296
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,300
That's all that matters.

3297
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,600
It's all about the adventures.

3298
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,000
And the fun we had.

3299
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:08,940
I know.

3300
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:14,220
Hey guys.

3301
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:17,000
We do have another stream tonight everybody.

3302
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,860
Look, I was not the dead weight.

3303
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:24,760
I did some clutch shit.

3304
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,400
That's all I'm saying.

3305
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:32,860
I pulled off my ones.

3306
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:34,620
I did my ones.

3307
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:35,280
Okay.

3308
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:36,320
I defended.

3309
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:39,520
I defended so well during the trebuchet moment.

3310
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:44,980
I fucking defended it so hard during the trebuchet.

3311
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,780
And like sent bombs over and everything.

3312
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,840
Like bro, come on.

3313
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:53,060
I went full.

3314
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:55,300
I fucking beat up the goalie.

3315
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:58,720
And I scored like four goals.

3316
01:50:59,040 --> 01:50:59,780
Like...

3317
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:06,300
All you did is punch the goalie.

3318
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:08,160
And that...

3319
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,340
And I did my one.

3320
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,940
I did my one.

3321
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:11,940
Okay.

3322
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,240
And I sent the bombs over.

3323
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:20,220
What they did with the bombs was their job.

3324
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:23,040
Like I sent the bombs over.

3325
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,740
They had to finish the job.

3326
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:33,760
I did my 50% of the work.

3327
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:36,280
I did my 50% of the work.

3328
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:40,920
I was sending bombs out.

3329
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,000
I did...

3330
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,500
Okay.

3331
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:45,700
That is not true, Sherpo.

3332
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:48,800
At best, I was the 80% at that point.

3333
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:54,860
Look.

3334
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:57,240
All I'm saying was that...

3335
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:59,180
No, no, no, no, no.

3336
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:02,220
Were you really the 90% in that one game we won?

3337
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:03,900
Huh, Sherpo?

3338
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:07,780
Were you the 90% on that one game we won?

3339
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:09,940
Where was the defending?

3340
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:11,100
That was Brie's job.

3341
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:12,780
Brie was the defender.

3342
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:15,860
I was fucking sending bombs over.

3343
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,400
I was carrying the bombs over.

3344
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:19,940
And then I...

3345
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:21,200
I sent it over.

3346
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,580
And then I...

3347
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:26,320
And then Brie had to do the defense for the other bombs.

3348
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:29,940
Mr. Lane Robbins was the carry.

3349
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:31,300
What is this?

3350
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:33,060
You're supposed to be my echo chamber.

3351
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:34,740
What the fuck is this?

3352
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:35,860
Anyway, guys.

3353
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:39,400
I had a great time with everybody.

3354
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:41,680
I had a great time with my team.

3355
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:44,400
For those who are new here...

3356
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,320
Also, thank you for the week away.

3357
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:47,980
But I'm just about to end it today.

3358
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:50,080
Because we just finished Twitch Rivals.

3359
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:52,120
But anyway, guys.

3360
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:56,140
If you're new here, I usually stream on the YouTubes.

3361
01:52:56,180 --> 01:52:58,040
So please check me out.

3362
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,800
Doki Bird YouTube.

3363
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:01,660
And that's where I usually stream.

3364
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:02,540
I actually have a stream tonight.

3365
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:07,100
But I'll be speaking Chinese tonight on YouTube with Hiro.

3366
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,580
And she's fluent and I'm not.

3367
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,820
She actually knows how to read and write.

3368
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:15,800
I don't know either.

3369
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:19,700
Anyway, if you want to support me via other means, please check out my merch.

3370
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:25,960
And if you want to know when I stream on Twitch, I usually tweet out when I'm streaming on Twitch on Twitter.

3371
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,560
So please follow me on Twitter.

3372
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:29,140
What else?

3373
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:32,520
Also, Friday, there's going to be a slight change in the schedule on Friday.

3374
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:38,420
I will be playing Marvel Rivals because I actually got invited to the Alpha test.

3375
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:41,080
I knew tweeting that out was a good idea.

3376
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:52,740
But yes, a person who knows the community manager reached out to me and said that they wanted to send me a code to try out Marvel Rivals on Friday.

3377
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:58,940
And they were possibly... I might be like... I don't know what it's called.

3378
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,020
Let me read what they said.

3379
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:05,200
They want to make me like one of the official content creators for Marvel Rivals.

3380
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:06,060
I'm not sure yet.

3381
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:11,080
But maybe I'll find out later today because they said they want to give me more details about it.

3382
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:12,200
But yeah.

3383
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:16,220
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody stay hydrated, pause to check you out, and move around to get that blood flowing.

3384
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:19,340
And when you stay up from me, head to bed because you deserve it.

3385
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,480
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3386
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,820
Bye, guys.

3387
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:22,920
Bye.
