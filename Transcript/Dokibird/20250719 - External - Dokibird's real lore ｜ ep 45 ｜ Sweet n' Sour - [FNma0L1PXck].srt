1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
What is it in VTuber terms, hag?

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,840
I'm a hagtuber.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,160
And then when you're 40, you're basically dead.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,060
Oh my god, those look like ball sex.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,200
But then your friend banned me because I called them a whore and I'm like...

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,640
Doki.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,240
Hey, that's me.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,340
When are you singing my song that I wrote for you?

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,920
First of all, we need to get the important things out of the way here.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,900
Okay, that's a news drop right there out of nowhere to start off the podcast.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,640
Yes, yes, yes.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,600
So, yes, Lilia wrote me a song a while ago.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,380
And I haven't done anything with it.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,120
Oh no, don't worry.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,120
No, no pressure.

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,840
Just so... I'm just making sure you haven't forgotten about it.

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,180
Yeah, no, I haven't.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,700
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,700
Okay, to be fair, okay.

20
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,400
Okay, to be fair, I have excuses lined up.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,160
Don't worry about this.

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,600
No, I understand.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,180
I understand.

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,500
I just thought it would be really fun to ambush you just like out of the gate.

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,440
This is like peer pressure.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,320
So now fans would be like, at Doki Bird, when are you going to sing your song?

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,540
It's such a good song, guys.

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,980
She's going to sound so great.

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,580
I'm just so excited for it, okay?

30
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,720
That's the only reason.

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,440
Yeah.

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,860
Yeah, so like she wrote me a song.

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,920
I asked Lily if she was open to writing me a song.

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,540
And her and her producer, who were also the ones that made last cup of coffee, were like super down.

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,740
And then months pass and it's still singing.

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,320
But I have an excuse, guys.

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,240
No, it's okay.

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,460
It's going to sound so good.

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, it's going to sound really good.

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,840
And the production balance is going to be insane.

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,020
But yes, like it was unfortunate timing because I actually got very sick when I was about to record.

42
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,360
No, I get you.

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Yeah, I got really sick and my throat was like not okay for the longest time.

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,280
And then because like, I don't even know, but I did like a 3D concert around like November or so.

45
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,300
And then during that time, I was sick before then.

46
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:13,240
For that November concert, when we were recording our songs, I literally submitted a song that was like, because I had like several songs I was doing for that concert.

47
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:21,680
And my last song I recorded for it, I submitted it two days before the concert was supposed to get me to start.

48
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,980
I was like, oh, shit.

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,800
Because that was how sick I was.

50
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,820
Because like, I got better.

51
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,300
And then when I had to travel to the studio to rehearse, I got sick during traveling there.

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,980
And so I came back, so my voice wasn't okay.

53
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,680
And then I went to Atlanta for the concert.

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,320
And then I got sick again.

55
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,380
You're getting sick quite often.

56
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
I think it's because of COVID.

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,980
Ever since COVID, my immune system got like really like fucked up.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,400
I don't know.

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,120
Am I allowed to swear?

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,160
Am I allowed to swear?

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,360
Yeah, you can swear.

62
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,180
Yeah.

63
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:57,980
Yeah.

64
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,320
So like during COVID, my immune system, I became like a bubble baby.

65
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,860
Because I was always inside a lot.

66
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,900
Because I always was like, I don't want to get COVID.

67
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,840
And because of that, ever since then.

68
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,960
And that was around the time.

69
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,360
I don't know.

70
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,480
You know, like COVID was around the time where the VTubing boom started.

71
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,120
Yes.

72
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,900
And then, yeah.

73
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,320
And then so like everyone was like staying at home mostly.

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,020
And that's where I started doing VTubing stuff.

75
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,980
And then because of that, I didn't really go outside anymore.

76
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,560
So my immune system got weaker and weaker.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,100
And then this year, this and last year, I was traveling so much.

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
But my body wasn't ready for that.

79
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,540
So like every time I travel, I would get sick.

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,780
Because after the concert, I went to Japan.

81
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,500
And then I got sick again.

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,640
Do you use that?

83
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,860
Do you carry around three bottles of hand sanitizer for baby?

84
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,720
Yeah, I do.

85
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,240
I can't.

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,840
But the thing was like during Japan, like people were like, like I went to a land there.

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
It was like the very first land I went to.

88
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,920
And there were so many people there.

89
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,800
Like there was just, you couldn't avoid it.

90
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,320
Yeah.

91
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,620
I just got over being sick too.

92
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,100
And it was very frustrating because I couldn't use my voice properly for like two, three weeks, which was quite insane.

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,560
And it just 1000% nerfed.

94
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,480
Oh, I also think maybe, oh my God.

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm such a bad podcast host.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,020
This is Doki Bird, everyone.

97
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,440
Oh, by the way.

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:17,780
Yeah, hello.

99
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm Doki Bird for this video.

100
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,140
Because like this is the first VTubing episode you're doing.

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
So you're like, who the heck is this virtual anime girl?

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,580
Poki isn't here.

103
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,140
So we thought it'd be really fun to do a VTube guest episode.

104
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,100
And I whip out my VTube model as well.

105
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,180
And we're both VTube models.

106
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,240
Yeah, so cute.

107
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:34,940
Yeah.

108
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,000
I heard you have like a collection of them too.

109
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,800
I know you've had like so many different like designs and models over the years.

110
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,960
I have, but it's only because like, you know, I feel like if I don't feel connected to the model, it's hard for me to use it.

111
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,560
This is the first model I really, really like.

112
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,340
I love it, which is why I'm using it so much, right?

113
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,200
That's true.

114
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,540
Yeah.

115
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,520
Same for me.

116
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,600
I know like a lot of people like my older one, the retro one with the twin tail, where the theme was thief.

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
But that was like, but that was like so old.

118
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,560
Like literally like during like COVID era time when I got that skin suit.

119
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,220
And then like, um, and like, yeah.

120
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,320
I like it.

121
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,400
I got that skin suit.

122
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,340
And then, but the, cause like it was rigged around that time too.

123
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,280
So like the rigging for that was very like outdated.

124
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,340
I did get it updated when I came back.

125
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,080
Um, but like still I did connect with it as much as I did during that time.

126
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,860
Because I felt like back then I was, when I used to stream back then during that era.

127
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm so sorry.

128
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,900
It's okay.

129
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,080
My dog is also like that too.

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,700
He like knows whenever I end stream too.

131
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,840
And like every time I end stream, he's like, oh, that's when, like, he knows my tone when I'm about to end stream.

132
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,460
And he runs in and would be like, it's time to feed me.

133
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,500
Dogs are so perceptive.

134
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,240
Wait, continue your story.

135
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,600
Wait, what was I talking about?

136
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,100
The Phantoms.

137
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,980
Oh, yeah, the thief one.

138
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:11,280
Yeah, but like I said, like, back then when I used to stream back, like I started streaming back then, I also didn't play a lot of FPS games back then.

139
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,740
I was more of like an artist streamer.

140
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,820
Cause I used to like draw a lot back then.

141
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,800
So like it matched well with the vibe.

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
But now I'm more of like a gaming streamer.

143
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,840
So like every time I see fan art of like, when I used to see fan art, I'd be like, the thief outfit with carrying a gun.

144
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,240
It just, it's like, I was like, oh, it's just something off.

145
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,100
There's something off about it.

146
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,240
And so like, that's why I was like, oh man, I want like something that fits me more.

147
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,740
I can totally get that.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,400
I think if it, like, if you relate to it more, you feel connected to it more, you want to, cause it's like supposed to represent you, you know?

149
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:46,940
Yeah.

150
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,920
Yeah, of course.

151
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,560
It's kind of how I felt too.

152
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm like, I need something simpler and just me.

153
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,140
And then I'm like, oh, I love this.

154
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,260
And like, but can you explain the, um, wait, so Phantom Thief is because, wait, why?

155
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,700
Oh, oh, Phantom Thief.

156
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,600
Oh, the Phantom Thief.

157
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,680
It was basically a play on my friend.

158
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,420
Her name is Mint Phantom.

159
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,160
And so like, fans started calling us because we do a lot of streams together.

160
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,600
Yeah.

161
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Like me and my friend.

162
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,500
And, um, they started, it's like a little ship name for them.

163
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,620
Like the Phantom Thief.

164
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,160
Oh, that's cute.

165
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
Phantom Thief.

166
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:20,860
Yeah.

167
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,760
So it was more so since like, every time we do something together, it'd be like, oh, it's the Phantom Thief duo.

168
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,440
Oh, that's adorable.

169
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
I like that.

170
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,000
I saw, I remember seeing like the super viral clip of you.

171
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,580
Oh, there's so many.

172
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,540
Oh my God.

173
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,900
I need to go beat my dog.

174
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,360
Hold on.

175
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,420
Oh, Timmy.

176
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm just joking.

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,780
That's a joke.

178
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,500
It's a bad joke.

179
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,700
I need to stop making that joke.

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,720
This is in Minecraft, right?

181
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,040
In Minecraft.

182
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,260
Do you like ever name a dog, Timmy?

183
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,060
No, it's too sad.

184
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,380
I get attached to my Minecraft dogs if I named them after my real dogs.

185
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,240
It's because dogs' lives are so short.

186
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,700
Yeah, but then you can, you know, like the new Minecraft update, you can feed it and then the hearts will go back up.

187
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,860
So you can just give it like a little, you know, a little warning hit.

188
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm just scared.

189
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,800
Sometimes they like, the teleporting aspect of them is a little wonky.

190
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,840
Oh, that's true.

191
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,000
So sometimes they like go in the middle of nowhere and I'm like, oh, you're dead.

192
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:19,500
Yeah.

193
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,460
You're just like...

194
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,420
Enough about dogs though.

195
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,760
It's all about horses right now.

196
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,180
Am I right?

197
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,880
Oh, true.

198
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,160
The Uma Musume.

199
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,280
Have you played?

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
No, I haven't played.

201
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,880
Because like, for me, okay, I'm always worried about playing any games related to gacha.

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
That's true.

203
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,220
Because like...

204
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:42,740
If I ever get hooked in anything where I have to spend money, like, I have a problem.

205
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,480
No, I understand that.

206
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,300
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,160
You've never done that.

208
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,460
Like, I haven't played...

209
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,040
Like, I told my chat would be like, when are you gonna play?

210
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,760
And I was like, you guys gotta bribe me to play this game because I...

211
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm worried.

212
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,920
Like, and also like, when I saw like people playing the game at first, there was so much reading.

213
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,900
I was like...

214
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,500
The horse game is on my tablet.

215
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,760
The horse game is called Uma Musume.

216
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,040
For anyone wondering, it's a really interesting anime horse game.

217
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,580
Anyway, and I spent $13 just to get like 10 pulls or something.

218
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:42,780
Right?

219
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,640
And then yesterday, I spent another $20.

220
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,280
So, in total, I spent $30, but that's it.

221
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:48,680
That's it.

222
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,740
I will not spend a single cent more.

223
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm basically free to play.

224
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,500
If we're being honest here.

225
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,860
But what if they come up with new horses?

226
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,260
That's...

227
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,480
What if they come up with new horses?

228
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh, man.

229
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,000
They're winning.

230
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,120
New support cars.

231
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,820
New horses.

232
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,660
New trainers.

233
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
What you gonna do?

234
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,540
Low-key be a really good horse girl name.

235
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,860
What?

236
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,160
With the bird at the end?

237
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,180
Doki Battle.

238
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,100
Doki Battle.

239
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,620
That would be so cool.

240
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,920
Oh, do we...

241
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,320
Oh my god.

242
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,860
Do you have ADHD?

243
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,720
I think I have ADHD.

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,260
Oh, I was talking about the fish.

245
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,760
So, Jackie.

246
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,640
Well, we're not gonna let you finish, but anyway.

247
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,700
Oh, no.

248
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,640
I love this so much.

249
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,060
I saw a clip of you going like, huh?

250
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,880
Like that...

251
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,600
That pink...

252
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,140
Can you do it?

253
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,360
Like...

254
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,440
Yeah, that thing!

255
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,360
It was so good.

256
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,640
I saw it and I immediately went to my record.

257
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,500
Soy.

258
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,900
I'm like, soy.

259
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,800
I want one too.

260
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,680
It was so...

261
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,320
I swear to you, I was like...

262
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,740
I didn't even realize I made that face.

263
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,720
Because whatever...

264
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,540
You saw like the full context, right?

265
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:48,960
Yeah.

266
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,860
Like, are you and Peter still together?

267
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,240
And then like that...

268
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,680
I was so...

269
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,000
I...

270
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,700
Because I was joking...

271
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,700
When that happened, I was just joking around with my chat.

272
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,280
Because I was like, oh, they're so like...

273
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,580
They're on a date right now.

274
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,280
And I'm just here trying to play Apex.

275
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,900
And then like, and then he dropped that.

276
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,500
And then she was like...

277
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,020
And then she was like, oh, no, yeah.

278
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,080
Yeah, we are.

279
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,340
And like, he's right beside me right now, playing like Minecraft.

280
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,780
And then, literally after that, the guy, DC's, like, disconnects from the game.

281
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
After she said that.

282
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,400
And then he was like, oh, and then he came back.

283
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,820
He was like, sorry, my internet, like, died for a little bit.

284
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,880
I was like, sure, buddy.

285
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,300
I think it was so good.

286
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,240
Because, like, it just felt like a very funny, like, genuine in the moment sort of thing.

287
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,620
Like, it was so funny.

288
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,960
I saw the clip and I died.

289
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,720
It was, it was great.

290
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,720
I was like, I can't believe that happened to me.

291
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,340
Because I wasn't, I wasn't even planning on streaming that day, too.

292
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,320
I was, like, literally, it was, the whole stream was just me trying to, I just got my new PC.

293
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,360
And, like, I just got it back.

294
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,760
So I was just stress testing my PC at that time.

295
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,080
So I was just, like, I just happened to stream and it just caught, like, it just caught that moment.

296
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,360
I was like, oh, my God.

297
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,000
The most random things go viral, I swear to God.

298
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,280
Yeah, that's so true.

299
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,340
Last night, my friend's alt Twitter tweet went viral, too.

300
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,100
For just, like, random reasons.

301
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,500
She just tweeted about a bad Uber experience, right?

302
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:15,760
Yeah.

303
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,820
Where she gave him a one star, because it was so bad, and then he circled around.

304
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,080
Wait, I saw that tweet!

305
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,520
Wait, you saw that?

306
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,900
It went in my algorithm!

307
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,360
That's what I mean.

308
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,860
It's, like, the most random tweets about, like, she, this isn't the first time a random tweet of hers got viral, too.

309
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,600
It's just, like, this random tweet!

310
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,640
Yeah, like, and, like, she didn't have, because I looked at her Twitter, too, because, like, you ever just look at, like, a viral tweet and just check someone's Twitter account?

311
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,380
Like, who are they as a person?

312
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,300
And I was like, she didn't have that many followers, too, on that alt Twitter.

313
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,460
Yeah.

314
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,220
And it just randomly blew up.

315
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,600
It's so random.

316
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:57,340
Sometimes, it's, um, it's funny, though, because, like, I have this, like, fear, low-key of this fear, I don't know if you have it, as a content creator, right?

317
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:03,100
You sleep, and then you wake up, and you wake up to, like, thousands and thousands of notifications.

318
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,540
You gotta check Twitter right now.

319
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,900
And I'm like, oh, my God, what did they find?

320
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,460
What did they do?

321
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:08,980
What did I do?

322
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm sorry.

323
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,620
And you're like, what leaked?

324
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,600
What Google talkie came out this time?

325
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:14,980
What?

326
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,260
Like, I think I lead a pretty peaceful life, but that's, like, low-key a nightmare situation.

327
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,520
Yeah, like, when you're, like, when you're, like, a content creator for so long, you're, like, you've done so many things, and you're just, like...

328
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,780
And then, but you just, like, see, like, other content creators getting cancelled and everything, and you're just wondering, oh, my God.

329
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,380
Like, what did I do?

330
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,160
What did I do?

331
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,380
That's true.

332
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,280
Yeah.

333
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,020
But I feel like even when content creators get, like, quote, unquote, cancelled, and people forget about it in, like, a week.

334
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,280
That's so true.

335
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,200
It's so fast.

336
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,320
I think, like, every, like, a week on the internet is, like, what, 20 years online?

337
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:53,820
Yes.

338
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,880
It feels like forever in the moment, and then something new happens, like, five minutes later, and we're, like, okay, we're gonna move on, I guess.

339
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,940
Yeah, like, it's just so forgettable.

340
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,120
We just have such short, I think it's, we just have such short attention spans these days.

341
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,180
Like, we're so, like, brain-rotted from the internet.

342
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:12,920
Oh, my God.

343
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,360
We just, like, just, like, something else just catches.

344
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,480
Like, you know, like, jingle jingle.

345
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,800
Do you browse, like, TikTok short-form content?

346
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
Oh, I do for YouTube shorts.

347
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,500
Not TikTok, though.

348
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,380
But YouTube shorts.

349
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,120
Yeah, YouTube shorts.

350
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,920
That makes you better.

351
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,880
Yes, because we're on YouTube right now.

352
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,040
This podcast is also going to be on YouTube.

353
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,000
Dude, I used to think like that.

354
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,100
Yeah, I'm like, yeah, I don't browse TikTok.

355
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,130
I browse shorts.

356
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,680
I'm a little bit more.

357
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,020
Yeah.

358
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,180
I'm more sophisticated than I'm more cultured.

359
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:41,500
Yeah.

360
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,080
And then I went down to TikTok rabbit hole anyway.

361
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,440
So now I browse all three.

362
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,820
Oopsies.

363
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,260
I feel like TikTok, like TikToks are, like, more brain-rotted than YouTube shorts.

364
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,480
Because I remember, like, seeing...

365
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,920
You know, like, when a TikTok video goes viral, it, like, shows up on Twitter.

366
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,380
Yeah.

367
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,020
Like, the stuff that comes from TikTok is just even...

368
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,600
Like, it's at a whole new level.

369
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,660
Because it's, like, we're...

370
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,300
What is it?

371
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,680
Gen...

372
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,920
What's the newest gen?

373
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,620
Not Gen Z.

374
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:09,880
No, no, no.

375
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,120
It's Gen Alpha now, man.

376
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,880
Yeah, Gen Alpha.

377
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,880
Oh, don't tell me.

378
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,660
I feel so old.

379
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm...

380
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,440
The chat calls me anti.

381
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,980
Like, I don't...

382
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,580
What is it in VTuber terms?

383
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,060
Hag?

384
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,920
Whatever the fuck.

385
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,180
Hag, yeah, yeah.

386
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
Dude, it's so, like...

387
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,840
I know it's...

388
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,200
It's...

389
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,240
Okay.

390
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,840
At first glance, it sounds kind of like, okay, it's a little rude.

391
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,160
But then, at the second class, it's a really funny meme.

392
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,140
Like, hag?

393
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,640
What a word to use.

394
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,100
Yeah.

395
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,960
Like, high hag.

396
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,860
And then it's like, when you hit 30, you're a hag.

397
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,660
You're a hag.

398
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,280
You're just...

399
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,080
You're eldritch.

400
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,420
You're, like, ancient.

401
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,000
And then when you're 40, you're basically dead.

402
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,620
You're dead.

403
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,700
Oh, my God.

404
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,820
That's so funny.

405
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,220
It does feel like, in this space, you know...

406
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,200
I think it's because my friends and I talk about this, right?

407
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,780
Because a lot of friends are my age, too.

408
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,260
It's like, we started off streaming.

409
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,700
There's nobody really, like, after us.

410
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,020
Us, this generation.

411
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:08,760
Yeah, I guess.

412
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,560
So there's nothing to look forward to, I guess.

413
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,520
So, if you're the oldest, obviously you're gonna be, you know, you're considered the oldest.

414
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,180
Which kind of sucks, but...

415
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,800
At the same time, you know, respect your elders and all that.

416
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,780
Respect your elders.

417
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:28,760
Yeah, because, like, you guys are basically, like, paving the way on, like, what to expect when you're older and everything.

418
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,140
I always, like...

419
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,960
Okay, to be fair, like...

420
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,720
When I always...

421
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,940
I was so surprised when I found out Shroud was only, like, 30.

422
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,000
Because he...

423
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,780
Because I thought...

424
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,920
Because he was here forever.

425
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,520
Forever.

426
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,960
But that's the thing.

428
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,980
30s is, like, paving the way.

429
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,920
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,520
30 is...

431
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,640
Which is crazy.

432
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,500
Is, like, the elderly.

433
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,320
And I was like, he's only 30?

434
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,380
I was so surprised.

435
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,280
I was like, bro, he...

436
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,220
To be fair, I thought he was, like, almost...

437
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,240
I'm sorry, but...

438
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,580
Yeah, I thought he was almost 40.

439
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,900
Oh, Shroud, don't look at this.

440
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,620
He's a nice guy, man.

441
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,080
He is.

442
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,500
He's a really nice guy.

443
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,160
But he was here forever.

444
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,120
He's, like, with Justin TV days, right?

445
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,260
Oh, my God.

446
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,780
I remember Justin TV.

447
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,180
Yeah.

448
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,680
And he was part of the OG CS.

449
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,220
Like, CS days as well.

450
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,460
So I never thought...

451
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,100
I was like, he's 30.

452
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,300
I was like, oh, my God.

453
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,900
That's a lot younger than I expected.

454
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,120
Well, nowadays, they're like...

455
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,980
Well, I was, like, seeing...

456
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,280
Like, you know, Jason Dewey, right?

457
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,820
The new and upcoming.

459
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,960
Very big streamer now.

460
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,820
But he's, like, 21 or something, right?

461
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,400
Yeah.

462
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:30,760
21.

463
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,900
It was so young.

464
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,100
And a lot of them are, like, that young.

465
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,000
Like, 19, 20.

466
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,900
You know, every time fans come up to me now.

467
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,620
Every time.

468
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,820
Every single time now.

469
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,680
They're like, I've been watching you since middle school.

470
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,260
It's so bad.

471
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,180
Every time.

472
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,320
No, it's not even, like, an isolated incident.

473
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,780
It used to be an isolated incident.

474
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,580
But now it's not.

475
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,860
They're in college now, Doki.

476
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,200
Oh.

477
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,580
I've been doing this way too long.

478
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,360
I've been doing this way too long.

479
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,100
You're going to have people come and be like, I used to watch you in elementary school.

480
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:56,860
I know.

481
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,560
I've had that.

482
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,280
I've had that.

483
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,240
Like, this one girl.

484
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,380
She's, like, 12 years old.

485
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,360
She's like, I watched you since I was five years old.

486
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,340
And I'm like...

487
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,540
You have your whole life ahead of you.

488
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,080
You're so young.

489
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,080
You're so young.

490
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,120
You're so young.

491
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,280
So bright-eyed.

492
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,240
Also, what are you doing on twitch.tv?

493
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,280
Actually, what are you doing?

494
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,600
What are you doing?

495
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,300
You're supposed to be 13 and older to have an account.

496
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:18,800
No.

497
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,180
I feel like kids these days are so much more in tune with, like, technology.

498
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,380
And, you know, everyone has a fucking iPad.

499
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,260
iPad kids everywhere.

500
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,100
iPad kids.

501
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:27,460
Yeah.

502
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,300
Back in my day, I had flip phones.

503
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:30,940
Flip phones.

504
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,860
Do you remember those?

505
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,000
I remember those.

506
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,880
Back in my day, my parents would let me have a phone until I was in eighth grade.

507
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:37,300
Yeah.

508
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,260
And now you start young.

509
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,160
Yeah.

510
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,460
Oh, do you know, like, but if you are an iPad kid, technically your brain is not developed very well.

511
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,780
Did you read that?

512
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,240
Did you read that?

513
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,080
That would be scary.

514
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,620
Like, if I were a parent and I read that, I'd have no more iPad for you.

515
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,200
Yeah.

516
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,700
I was like, what?

517
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,640
Yeah.

518
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,920
Because, like, you know, nobody had, like, studies for it yet.

519
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,080
And then now they do because iPad's been a while for a while.

520
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,700
They're like, oh, yeah.

521
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,460
Now that we, like, actually know what happens when you give kids iPads, it actually messes up brain development for children.

522
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,240
Dude.

523
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:19,580
I am low-key scared of that kind of study, but with other things that we are currently doing, like, for example, society's overconsumption of caffeine.

524
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,680
Like, I drink a lot of diet cokes and stuff.

525
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
Like, you know, all that aspartame skin.

526
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:26,780
Yeah.

527
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:28,940
Yeah.

528
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,640
That's so true.

529
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,640
Energy drinks, like, a lot of...

530
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
Hey, we're here for a good time, not a long time.

531
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,700
Remember?

532
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,560
That's right.

533
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,280
I mean, I'm already pretty much dead in my thirties.

534
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,960
Yeah.

535
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,200
You're approaching 40.

536
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:41,980
You're...

537
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
Dude, it's...

538
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,380
When I was in my late twenties, people would always say, yeah, you're pushing 30.

539
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,840
You shouldn't be doing this stuff anymore.

540
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,120
Now that I'm in my thirties, they say, yeah, you're pushing 40.

541
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm like, it's never gonna end, is it?

542
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,960
It just doesn't end.

543
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,580
Yeah.

544
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,600
It's actually...

545
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,760
Yeah.

546
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,400
It's...

547
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,680
It's very interesting, like, seeing, like, what the...

548
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,720
Like, we're literally living, living through it now to see, like, our consequences.

549
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,680
Cause we're like...

550
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,000
Cause you're like the test subject.

551
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,400
You know, it's so interesting to see, like, how far VTubing has gone too.

552
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,180
Oh, true.

553
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,040
Like, so many VTubers.

554
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,870
Every single combination of human eggs, some kind of animal, slash mystical animal design.

555
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,380
Slash thing.

556
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,980
Slash place.

557
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,660
Yeah.

558
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,360
It's like, whoa, I'm waiting for the first refrigerator VTuber or something.

559
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,760
You know?

560
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,360
Fridge Chan.

561
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,140
Fridge Chan.

562
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,840
Are you...

563
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,400
You're just human or a bird?

564
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm a...

565
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,540
Well, yeah.

566
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm like half bird, half human.

567
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,500
Cause I was like a dokey bird.

568
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,180
Yeah.

569
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,360
I would say it's very bird oriented.

570
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,060
You know?

571
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:47,940
Yeah.

572
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,620
Do you have like a...

573
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,660
Like a...

574
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,800
Like, you know how VTubers have like a lore thingy?

575
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,560
How they came to...

576
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,740
Do you have a lore?

577
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,440
Oh, yeah.

578
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,100
Like, I'm actually a tomato.

579
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,280
And like, I have various, like...

580
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,120
Skin suits.

581
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,800
Makes sense.

582
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,660
That I get into.

583
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,800
So...

584
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,200
So I have like...

585
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,060
I have a crow version of me.

586
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,460
Wait, can I see?

587
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,340
Oh, you wanna...

588
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,740
Okay, wait.

589
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,020
Can you show me your outfits?

590
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,540
Okay.

591
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,480
I'll show you my outfits.

592
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,780
So I have a crow version.

593
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,720
I have a Garfield version.

594
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,080
I have a tomato...

595
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,980
Or OG tomato.

596
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,820
And then...

597
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,080
And I have like a...

598
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,660
And I have like various outfits as well.

599
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
So wait, I can show you like...

600
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,520
I can take off my skin.

601
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:31,740
Change.

603
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,260
Changing.

604
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,940
Alright, let me...

605
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,300
Let me change real quick.

606
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,860
We should do like an animation here where like curtains go over her.

607
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,140
And the curtains come out.

608
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,040
Cause that'd be really funny.

609
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,260
Like the magical girl.

610
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:41,760
Yeah.

611
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,420
Where is...

612
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,040
Oh, there it is.

613
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,160
I haven't brought this out in a while.

614
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,600
I only bring it out for like...

615
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,780
Special occasions.

616
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,720
Oh, I'm excited.

617
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,480
Wait.

618
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,480
Okay, wait.

619
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,220
I'm holding a knife.

620
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,280
Let me take my knife off.

621
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,620
I don't know why, but...

622
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,080
I forgot.

623
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,240
I put a...

624
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,140
I had to wear a...

625
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,080
That is not what I expected.

626
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,640
Literally a tomato.

627
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,480
Yeah.

628
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,220
Yeah.

629
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,180
Um...

630
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,340
So like beneath every...

631
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,180
All my skin suit.

632
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,820
This is me.

633
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,420
I'm like...

634
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,900
So like...

635
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,340
It's like a tomato that's pilot.

636
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:13,840
Like...

637
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,680
Oh, get in the Mecca.

638
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,720
So I'm like piloting every anime girl out there.

639
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,520
And...

640
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,180
And a crow.

641
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,060
And a crow too.

642
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,080
And...

643
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,740
I freaking love that.

644
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,420
That is so funny.

645
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,880
Oh, wait, wait.

646
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,640
I have like...

647
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,620
Let me put...

648
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,200
I have a special toggle for this too.

649
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,780
Um...

650
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,320
Let me see if I can...

651
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,940
Oh my gosh.

652
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,060
I need to remember all my...

653
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,200
Toggle stuff.

654
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,580
It's been so long.

655
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,380
Okay.

656
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,460
Uh...

657
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:42,960
Oh my gosh.

658
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
There's this really good one that I like to use.

659
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,140
Okay, there's this one.

660
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,580
I don't know why, but your voice fits the tomato really well.

661
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,120
Oh, I know.

662
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,700
Yeah, I know.

663
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,420
I know it does.

664
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,740
For the audio only listeners, she does indeed have a tomato form.

665
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,100
It's the most janky shit I've ever seen, but it's very cute.

666
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,500
Why does her face...

667
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,740
It gets tiny and small.

668
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:03,900
Yeah.

669
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,740
Do you have little bites?

670
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,500
Like...

671
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,320
Oh, that's...

672
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,480
Her face gets really small in the tomato, which adds to the comedic effect.

673
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,420
I have like a hat.

674
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,720
Oh, the hat is so cute.

675
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,540
Yeah.

676
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,420
I can wear a hat.

677
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,520
I can wear a hat.

678
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,580
And then I can have...

679
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,860
I can be a cowboy too.

680
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,640
I'd be like...

681
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,060
Yee-haw.

682
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,100
And then...

683
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,260
Oh!

684
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,600
She's a little cute little...

685
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,100
You know, it's the...

686
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,340
It's basically the pleading emoji.

687
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,620
Yeah.

688
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,120
Like...

689
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,120
And this one's my favorite.

690
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,080
Wait.

691
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,640
RGB tomato.

692
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,820
RGB on.

693
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,580
You know?

694
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,080
Oh, wait.

695
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,040
I don't know how to turn it off.

696
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,120
I don't know how to turn it off.

697
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,780
She doesn't act.

698
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,400
She's just switching colors right now.

699
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,060
She looks like she's having a bad trip.

700
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,340
I'm like, oh, take your meds.

701
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,800
Take your meds.

702
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,440
But...

703
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,800
My favorite definitely is...

704
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,600
The crow.

705
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,920
Because every time I put out the crow, everyone was like...

706
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,540
Oh my god.

707
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,440
Like, your voice fits perfectly on the crow.

708
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,380
Let me see.

709
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,780
Let me see.

710
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,180
Let me see.

711
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,560
Okay.

712
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,620
But that actually takes a while to set up though.

713
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,120
Really?

714
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:07,780
Okay.

715
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,160
Let's do it at the end then.

716
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:09,720
Okay.

717
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah.

718
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,420
Because that one is like...

719
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,560
It's like a 3D model.

720
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,200
So I have to...

721
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Oh, you have a 3D model.

722
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:14,520
Yeah.

723
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,500
The crow is like...

724
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,740
The crow is a 3D model.

725
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,140
So...

726
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,360
This one's recent.

727
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,360
This one I just...

728
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,980
That one is so cute.

729
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,960
Oh my god.

730
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,460
That one is so cute.

731
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,880
Every time I press anything, it's like I'm texting.

732
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
So I'm like, I'm gonna cancel you right now on Twitter.

733
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:29,900
Let me...

734
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,340
Let me type it on my phone.

735
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:33,920
Wait.

736
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,480
I love that one.

737
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,980
It's so cute.

738
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,520
Oh my god.

739
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,580
You make me want to commission more outfits and stuff.

740
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,340
But they're so fucking expensive, man.

741
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:42,720
Oh, that's the fun part.

742
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,540
That's the fun part.

743
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,920
So I can change it to like a tomato hoodie too.

744
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,120
Oh, that's so cute.

745
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,720
And then...

746
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,780
I'm gonna have like a lollipop.

747
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,220
Like...

748
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,880
Oh my god.

749
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,840
That's so cute.

750
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,580
I'm gonna stuff you in a locker.

751
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,520
I want more outfits now.

752
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,640
Oh, you should...

753
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,820
That's like the fun part.

754
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,400
Honestly.

755
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,520
But like...

756
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,680
It's so expensive though.

757
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,200
Like YouTubing.

758
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,100
Oh, that's so true.

759
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,100
It's so expensive.

760
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,180
That's so true.

761
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,720
Like not just like the art itself, but the rigging too.

762
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,180
The rig...

763
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,560
No, I tried rigging like one thing once.

764
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,300
Like the mini...

765
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,880
I see those like mini chibi ones.

766
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,460
But even that took me like two full days to like learn the tracking and everything.

767
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:21,820
Right?

768
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,180
And that's not like with all the cool physics and stuff, you know?

769
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:25,940
That's true.

770
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,720
But I have a lot more, you know, respect for people who rig models.

771
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,280
Yeah, yeah.

772
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,120
That's the most time consuming thing.

773
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,740
I really thought it was going to be under like my list of hobbies.

774
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,140
But I crossed that out really quickly because the amount of time it takes is unreal.

775
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,180
Oh, that is so true though.

776
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,680
Like have you ever seen...

777
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,900
Okay, so my rigger is Celia.

778
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,380
And she's like one of the most like well-known like VTubing rigs rigger out there.

779
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,580
And she recently did like...

780
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,660
She recently did Saba's rigging.

781
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,320
And she posted like her...

782
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,840
She posted like the file for it.

783
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,560
And it was crazy.

784
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,100
Like...

785
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,300
No.

786
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,360
I know.

787
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,520
It's insane.

788
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
Not only the rigging part too, but like the art.

789
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,020
Well, yeah.

790
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,500
I tried drawing the file as well.

791
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,800
Just making it like separating everything into layers.

792
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,460
Yeah.

793
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,780
And then they have to redraw some of the layers too to make it work.

794
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,140
Yeah.

795
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,520
And everything like cutting wise as well.

796
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,560
And then...

797
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,000
It's such tedious work.

798
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,520
Yeah.

799
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,860
Essentially making the 2D art look kind of 3D.

800
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,660
Yeah.

801
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
And it has to be like natural too.

802
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,700
Because when you turn this way, I make sure...

803
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,380
Everything just looks okay, right?

804
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:35,680
Yeah.

805
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,340
Angle wise looks like...

806
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,340
Looks natural and everything because it's all about...

807
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,480
Because if it's off a little bit like...

808
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,160
You look weird.

809
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,700
Your brain will notice it right away too.

810
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,540
You're like...

811
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,720
Like it's like an uncanny valley type...

812
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,800
The moment you realize something's off.

813
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,640
I love how much it's grown.

814
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,200
Like I wish 20 year old Lily had this technology.

815
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,080
I remember using fucking PNGs.

816
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,900
Like 2 PNGs.

817
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,500
True with Fugi's and stuff too.

818
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,340
Well, I still love Fugi's though.

819
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,860
I think Fugi's are just so gif.

820
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,460
For those who don't know, it's like...

821
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,920
Still PNG and then active...

822
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,560
Like a talking PNG when you talk essentially.

823
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,240
Like voice acting.

824
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,380
It can be animated too.

825
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,080
It can be animated too.

826
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,000
It can be like a gif and stuff.

827
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,400
And it's like more immersive.

828
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,180
Yeah.

829
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,460
And like you actually know who's talking.

830
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:21,860
Like...

831
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,760
I draw one for like everyone I'm in call with.

832
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,220
Yeah.

833
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,760
Because it just...

834
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,960
It just makes it so much cuter in my opinion.

835
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,340
Yeah, yeah.

836
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,720
Like there's just more like...

837
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,840
Like it's just more animated and more like...

838
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,020
I guess personal wise.

839
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,200
Like for the community and for yourself to look at.

840
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
I love you too.

841
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,360
Oh yeah, but...

842
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
Oh wait, I forgot to show you my last outfit.

843
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,580
This one...

844
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,800
This one I got for...

845
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,300
It's like my summer outfit.

846
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,220
But this was the other outfit I have.

847
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,100
Oh my god!

848
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm like on a beach.

849
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,240
And then I...

850
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,720
I love that.

851
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,080
And then I didn't realize this, but...

852
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,020
Okay, I'm gonna unlock it.

853
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,140
And like...

854
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,200
So I have...

855
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,480
Oh my god!

856
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,820
Those look like ball sex!

857
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,760
Yeah, I do!

858
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,020
They look like ball sex!

859
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,840
You've been told this, right?

860
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,460
You have been told this!

861
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,160
Okay, but look at the physics though.

862
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,720
Okay, the physics is phenomenal.

863
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,660
Like truck nuts.

864
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,020
Like it's just really good.

865
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,600
Okay, so...

866
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,140
I didn't realize how...

867
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,280
Sus...

868
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,520
It was.

869
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,120
No, no, no, no, no.

870
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,560
It's perfect.

871
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:15,900
It's perfect.

872
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,280
The audio only was there.

873
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,080
She's in like a...

874
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,580
Like a Hawaii teacher sort of thing.

875
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:21,760
Yeah, yeah.

876
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,020
And there's three...

877
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,260
Tomato...

878
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,340
Looking water balloons.

879
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:25,520
Water balloons.

880
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,260
Yes, hanging from her...

881
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,000
Side bag.

882
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,760
But when she bounces up and down, it does look like ball sex.

883
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,180
The physics of it.

884
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,560
So you should check out...

885
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,960
Check out the video on YouTube.

886
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:35,940
Check out the video.

887
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,520
There are a lot of audio only listeners.

888
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,160
So I try to like tell them...

889
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,560
Wait, I really like this.

890
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,780
It gives like a...

891
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,020
What's the androgynous feel to it?

892
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

893
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,180
Yeah.

894
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,880
So I'm like...

895
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,400
The...

896
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
The cool ass.

897
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,360
Yeah, you're the cool fucking...

898
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,220
The cool ass at the beach.

899
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,740
When I did the summer...

900
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,680
Cause like for this one, it was actually like...

901
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,040
I did a charity auction for this outfit.

902
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,480
Uh huh.

903
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,360
So like I was like, okay, whoever wins the auction gets to design the new outfit.

904
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,780
Wait, that's so sick.

905
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,260
Yeah.

906
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,980
So like it was like a fan that designed this outfit too.

907
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,160
You're so cool.

908
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,380
That's such a good idea.

909
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,680
Wow.

910
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,900
So yeah, it's like, you know, something good for charity and also like something the fan won.

911
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,560
Yeah.

912
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,940
Honestly, they designed it really cute.

913
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,220
I really like it.

914
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,300
Uh, but yeah, that's like the parts.

915
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,540
Cause like for this one, they also wanted a tail too.

916
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,580
So you can sort of see...

917
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,620
Wait.

918
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,400
I see the tail.

919
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:26,600
Yeah.

920
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah.

921
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,720
Cause they were like, we wanted, we want you to be more bird-like.

922
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,540
So they like, uh, gave me a tail.

923
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,900
To be like, okay, now you're definitely Doki bird.

924
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,060
Wow.

925
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,780
So cool.

926
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,020
I love seeing different like...

927
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:42,820
Dude.

928
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,460
Oh my gosh.

929
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,360
Show you my one outfit.

930
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,160
Yeah.

931
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:45,900
Ready?

932
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,980
Yeah, I'm ready.

933
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,300
Um, sorry.

934
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:49,600
That's it.

935
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,220
That's the...

936
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,340
Okay.

937
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,120
But not only that way.

938
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,640
That's not it.

939
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,080
That's not it.

940
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,100
It's okay.

941
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,980
I have one too.

942
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,860
That's it.

943
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,560
Okay, glasses do this though.

944
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,640
And then the...

945
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,460
And then the color changed.

946
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,360
But that's really all I ordered because I'm like...

947
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,840
I think before I tried too much at once and it overwhelmed me.

948
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,540
So I...

949
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,080
This time I'm taking it like...

950
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,140
Simple.

951
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,540
Tiny bit at a time.

952
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah.

953
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:17,480
Yeah.

954
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,680
To be fair, like...

955
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,960
For like the toggles and stuff, like...

956
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,900
You normally don't even really use it on stream.

957
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,040
That's what I learned.

958
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,120
Like, my first YouTube models, I commissioned like seven toggles and I'm like, why the fuck did I do that?

959
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,440
It only cost more money and I end up just using the simplest one anyway.

960
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,480
Like this...

961
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:33,960
What is it?

962
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,020
Oh, yeah.

963
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,240
I just asked for like a disappointed toggle because I'm disappointed in my chat or something.

964
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,560
Are you always disappointed in them?

965
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,920
No, they're disappointed in me, especially when I boot up Valorant.

966
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,800
They tell me to end stream.

967
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,660
Oh!

968
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
No, I don't blame them.

969
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,720
Oh, God.

970
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,760
I'm so bad at FPS.

971
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,420
Yeah, I'm really bad at Valorant.

972
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,580
That's like...

973
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:02,120
People are always surprised when I tell them like, I'm so bad at like, tactical shooters.

974
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,380
Cause you're like, you play...

975
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,900
You're like an FPS like, VTuber.

976
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,140
How are you bad at like, tactical shooters?

977
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,960
But like, I'm so like, I always tell people I don't have ADHD, but it seems like I do.

978
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,200
But like, I just, I think it's just being brain rotted.

979
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:17,980
It's not ADHD.

980
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,520
It's just, I'm just so brain rotted.

981
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:19,880
Oh, no.

982
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,660
We gotta fix this.

983
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,080
We gotta fix this.

984
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,820
But basically like, when I play tactical shooters like Valorant, you know, like the thing is, you have, you can't move when you're shooting.

985
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,340
Yes.

986
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,860
And like, I, I, that's just goes against everything I want to do.

987
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,380
Oh, that's true.

988
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:34,880
Yeah.

989
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,360
Apex are moving like constantly.

990
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:36,920
Yeah.

991
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,900
Cause if you're like, I play for me, I play mostly play movement shooters.

992
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,040
So I play like Apex, Overwatch, Marvel Rivals.

993
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,260
And they're all about, you have to move.

994
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:46,760
You have to move.

995
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,040
Yeah.

996
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,360
Yeah.

997
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,640
If you move, if you don't move, you die.

998
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,240
Yeah.

999
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,280
And if you move in Valorant or any of you shooting your fucking ass.

1000
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,960
And Chad is like, why the fuck are you moving?

1001
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,920
You have to stop and shoot.

1002
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,540
And then, and then you always have to have your cross.

1003
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,960
You always have to have your crosshair at their head at the whole time.

1004
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,660
I know.

1005
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,780
But if you play movement shooter, like if you play Apex, my, cause I played, spent so many years on Apex.

1006
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,900
And for Apex, your crosshair has to be at the body, not the head.

1007
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,020
So it's like, it like fucks with me when I have to play Valorant.

1008
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,240
Yo, that's completely different.

1009
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:19,900
Yeah.

1010
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,160
Yeah.

1011
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,480
Completely different.

1012
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,460
The muscle, like memory, like with my hand, it just fucks with me.

1013
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,400
So I could never get into, I never could get into tactical shooter.

1014
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,500
It's just so slow for me.

1015
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,460
What kind of other games, what other games do you play nowadays?

1016
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,480
Well, I usually, I just play like Rivals on the side.

1017
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,100
Rivals.

1018
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:38,700
Yeah.

1019
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,580
And like for me, like, people would be like, oh, what single player games do you play off stream?

1020
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,320
But like, I don't like, cause I'm like, if I'm going to play single player, I'll just stream it.

1021
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:47,600
You know?

1022
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,820
Yeah, that makes sense.

1023
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,680
That's how I feel too.

1024
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,100
I'm like, I might as well stream this.

1025
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,640
Yeah.

1026
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,220
Like I'm like, cause also like, oh my gosh.

1027
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,460
Okay.

1028
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:06,000
So you, I always say this joke to my chat, but one of the reasons why I love streaming like single player games is so I could be like, you know, it's like at chat GP, like at Grok, like, how is this real?

1029
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,080
So I could be, I always be like at chat.

1030
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,320
What do I do next?

1031
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:19,100
Like, I'm like, I love, I actually love backseating because like, I, I, I like, I, you know, I was like, I don't know what to do next.

1032
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,600
So I could be like, chat, where do I go?

1033
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,600
No, but sometimes chat gives you wrong information.

1034
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:25,800
Yeah.

1035
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,480
Yeah.

1036
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,620
But that would be like, I've had that happen.

1037
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,920
But then I like, cause like I was playing this game, the new FNAF game.

1038
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:47,640
I don't remember what it's called, but the, the secret, I remember there was, there's a new FNAF game that came out and they were like making me, like, I had to go to this store and I need to get password, but I missed the clue to get the password, but I didn't want to go back.

1039
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,660
So I was like, okay, chat, tell me, just tell me the password.

1040
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,700
Cause I'm not going to go back.

1041
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,700
And then, and then they kept like, we're like, you know, they'll be like type boob, you know, like eight years.

1042
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,460
And I was like, no, it's not boob.

1043
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,100
And then I was like, I'll be like, guys, I know one of you will crack.

1044
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,460
And I was like, guys, I know like some of you guys here want me to get this achievement.

1045
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,840
Like to unlock the secret ending.

1046
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,560
And if I don't get the answer in five minutes, I will leave.

1047
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,380
Cause I don't care as much as you guys.

1048
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,820
Like for the secret ending.

1049
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,500
Do you ever get like one guide?

1050
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,880
Oh, lots of times.

1051
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,000
And then I, and then when I do get one guide.

1052
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,800
You banned them.

1053
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,140
Okay.

1054
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
You banned them.

1055
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,880
I have, if they me over, I have, I have like given them a one day ban if they me over.

1056
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,300
But like, whenever I get one guy, it's not even one guy.

1057
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,440
It's like three guys.

1058
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,860
Oh no.

1059
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,540
Three guys would give me the wrong answer.

1060
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,700
And then they're like, I can't believe you got three guides.

1061
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,540
Three guides is crazy.

1062
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,240
That would happen to me.

1063
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,940
But yeah.

1064
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,560
Oh my gosh.

1065
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,060
The amount of times I get one guide.

1066
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,520
It's, it's looking crazy.

1067
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Yeah.

1068
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,340
I feel like sometimes all the chats gonna, chats like great, right?

1069
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:03,900
Yeah.

1070
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,520
And then one person says something.

1071
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,000
And for some reason you single that person out and that person, you just listen to them.

1072
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,060
And then it's wrong.

1073
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,380
And then.

1074
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:13,680
Yeah.

1075
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,300
And just.

1076
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,620
It'll never happen again.

1077
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,520
If you ever got like the chatter that would spam the wrong answer multiple times.

1078
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,480
So you think everyone's saying that answer, but it's just him.

1079
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,540
It's just him.

1080
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,200
Dude.

1081
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:33,240
My favorite part about Twitch is, um, you can click on their name and see their chat history.

1082
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,540
Right?

1083
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,200
Oh yeah.

1084
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:34,500
Yeah.

1085
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,440
It's awesome.

1086
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,880
Once I was, um, you know, the share chat feature when you collab with other streamers.

1087
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,080
Yeah.

1088
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:48,080
Um, one chatter in my friend's chat was like, yeah, I got banned in Lily's chat for saying she should do this.

1089
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,120
I was just trying to help.

1090
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,340
And I'm like, okay.

1091
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:50,940
Okay.

1092
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,680
Let's see.

1093
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,020
So I pull up his chat.

1094
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,640
The receipts.

1095
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,400
He was saying some very inappropriate stuff.

1096
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,280
Let's just say that.

1097
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,940
And I'm like, I can't believe you would just lie about that.

1098
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,060
Like, I can see your history, bro.

1099
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,660
Like, wow.

1100
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,840
Lying on the internet.

1101
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,460
I like how they go to your friend's chat too.

1102
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,060
And I'm like, you think I'm not gonna pull up your chat box.

1103
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,060
I'm just like, Lily's not here.

1104
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,960
I can do this.

1105
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,060
We had a shared chat.

1106
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,020
Also, my friend ended up banning them too.

1107
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,200
I know.

1108
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,460
Yeah.

1109
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:25,260
I found out recently, but like, apparently if you do a shared chat, you ban someone and time someone out in like your own chat.

1110
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,320
Oh, it carries over.

1111
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:26,680
Yeah.

1112
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,720
It carries over too.

1113
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,220
Oh.

1114
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,640
Yeah.

1115
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,460
I just found out.

1116
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,980
I don't know if that's like an old feature or a new feature.

1117
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,460
I kind of like that.

1118
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,040
Yeah.

1119
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:34,860
Yeah.

1120
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,400
Nicole, I'm sorry.

1121
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,220
No, no, you go first.

1122
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:36,680
No, no, no.

1123
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,460
I was just gonna say, yeah.

1124
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,860
Cause like, then you don't have to like, you know, tell your friend to be like, oh, remember ban this guy.

1125
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,180
Be sure.

1126
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,260
Watch out for this guy.

1127
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:45,620
Yeah.

1128
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:54,600
A lot of times people, sometimes they'll come over from my friend's chat and they're like, yeah, um, your friend banned me because I called them a whore.

1129
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,600
And I'm like, what do you want me to do, man?

1130
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,340
Like what?

1131
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:58,720
Why?

1132
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,860
It's like, it's like, you can't, I don't get the logic.

1133
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,300
I really don't like, you think you're gonna get favors?

1134
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,760
Like a teacher.

1135
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:14,440
Like I called your friend a slut and she banned me and I'm like, you're not a good person.

1136
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,060
Yeah.

1137
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,600
You're like, yeah, I can't, I can't believe she would do that.

1138
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,420
Oh, so funny.

1139
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,100
Crazy.

1140
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,620
That's actually crazy.

1141
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,780
Wow.

1142
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:28,900
I'm hungry.

1143
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,020
Thankfully, today's sponsor is Factor.

1144
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,400
You guys know the drill.

1145
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,260
Trying to eat well, something specific like keto is a huge amount of work.

1146
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,320
I've tried to stick to keto so many times and who wrote this?

1147
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,180
Who wrote this?

1148
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,100
That is true though.

1149
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,100
I did try keto so many times.

1150
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,940
With Factor, it's just, it's literally right there.

1151
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,480
It arrives fresh, ready to eat, straight to your door.

1152
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,060
No cooking, zero meal prep.

1153
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,700
You just put it in the microwave or oven and they're ready to eat in minutes.

1154
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:00,200
It's perfect for any active lifestyle or inactive like me where I sit in front of my computer and stream.

1155
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,380
My current favorite meal is the Roasted Garlic Butter Salmon.

1156
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,480
It's really good.

1157
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,140
It fulfills my protein obligations because I don't work out but I still like protein because it makes me feel healthy even though I don't work out.

1158
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,320
But I should work out because I'm getting old and my body's breaking down.

1159
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,100
The variety is incredible.

1160
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,880
You have 45 weekly menu options.

1161
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,140
You can pick any meal that fits your summer gains or goals, whatever they are.

1162
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,340
So, if you want to enjoy more this summer and get all the flavor with none of the fuss, I recommend Factor.

Bye.

1167
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,000
But yeah, but you've been on YouTube.

1168
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,200
You had a YouTube partnership, right?

1169
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,240
Yes.

1170
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,620
Yeah.

1171
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,180
Like two years ago now, right?

1172
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,660
Oh my God.

1173
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,100
Was it really two years ago?

1174
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,520
Dude, time goes by so fast now.

1175
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,060
Yeah, it's so good.

1176
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,060
I remember seeing that trailer when it came out that you got signed over to YouTube.

1177
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,700
That was two years ago.

1178
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,600
Oh my God.

1179
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,620
Got my bag.

1180
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,440
Got your bag.

1181
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:13,860
At the time it was like, oh, I can't believe I was even considering like not taking it.

1182
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,580
It's so fucking stupid because when I think about it, like no one would say no to that amount of money.

1183
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:18,800
Right?

1184
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,300
Like it's life changing money.

1185
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,680
I think anyone in my position would have taken it.

1186
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:22,880
Yeah.

1187
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,200
And I'm really glad I did.

1188
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,220
You could like, obviously you always come, obviously you can come back.

1189
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:27,580
Yeah.

1190
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,820
And you come back and you still do whatever you want to do.

1191
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,940
And then, but then there's like less pressure, you know?

1192
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,900
Because you know you already...

1193
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,240
Way less pressure.

1194
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,920
You have like the money for the future type deal.

1195
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,620
It's already set for life type stuff.

1196
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,600
It's like, um, yeah.

1197
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,660
Like I stream because like I want to, because I have fun with it.

1198
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,920
And it's, I've been having more fun recently.

1199
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,440
Yeah.

1200
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,040
And it's like, it doesn't feel like bad.

1201
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,820
Like I used to sometimes.

1202
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,760
I'm having fun.

1203
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,240
Yeah.

1204
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,300
Because you're not about like really chasing numbers or anything or like doing what's best for like growth.

1205
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:57,460
You just do what's fun.

1206
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,140
If I want to play horse girl anime game for three hours, they're going to watch me play Uma Musume, you know?

1207
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,720
And you're like, I, this is what I enjoy.

1208
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,940
You support me.

1209
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,520
Yeah.

1210
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,200
I'm going to play this anime horse girl game.

1211
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,620
Yeah.

1212
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,480
I remember when it came out, like Skara, Skara is the one who started playing it.

1213
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:18,660
Right?

1214
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,020
Yeah.

1215
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,220
And we're at the, like, we're all hanging out and he's trying to show us.

1216
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,840
No, you don't understand guys.

1217
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,140
They're like horse girls, but they're anime.

1218
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,460
And we all give him the side eye.

1219
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:27,720
Okay.

1220
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,940
We're like Skara.

1221
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,360
Please.

1222
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,820
Okay.

1223
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,140
Not in front of other people.

1224
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,280
Is that weird though?

1225
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,700
There's so many weird gacha games out there.

1226
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,520
I know.

1227
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,680
To be fair, that seems very tame for the other ones.

1228
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,340
It is.

1229
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,420
He's like, we can try to describe it.

1230
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:42,620
Yeah.

1231
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,460
So they're horses, but they're anime girls and they're racing like it.

1232
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,180
Yeah.

1233
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,560
Anyway.

1234
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,540
So you're like racing women.

1235
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,320
I must apologize to him.

1236
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,480
Because now I'm in more, I'm in very deep.

1237
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,120
Every time I go on a stream.

1238
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,760
He's streaming right now.

1239
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,540
He's playing the horse girl game right now.

1240
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,260
That's insane.

1241
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,320
They get you.

1242
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:02,540
Yeah.

1243
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,500
Because it's super popular in Japan for like years now.

1244
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:06,760
Yeah.

1245
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,680
It just came over to the United States.

1246
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,040
Yeah.

1247
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:09,880
Yeah.

1248
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:10,820
Global release.

1249
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,340
But I remember when my child was like telling me about it.

1250
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,760
And I was like, I am not surprised that it got really popular in like US or like NA.

1251
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,740
Because I was like, bro, Americans will race anything.

1252
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:29,400
Like it's like a primal nature to see who's the fastest, you know?

1253
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:41,560
And I was like saying like, this is basically like legal gambling because like, I don't even know this, but like horse racing in the States is like getting more and more banned or like restricted now.

1254
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:48,780
Because of like, you know, like animal rights and stuff because like horse mistreatment in some places.

1255
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,600
I didn't know that.

1256
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:49,940
Yeah.

1257
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,420
So a lot of places that does horse racing in the States are like closing down because of it.

1258
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,980
So then like, this is like, they're fixed here.

1259
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,400
Like racing anime girls legally.

1260
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,420
Without the worry of like...

1261
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,840
It also makes me happy because like, you know how like they're based off of real horses in Japan.

1262
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,340
And like, you know, like one of the horses, you know, Haru Udara, she got like...

1263
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:15,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1264
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,260
Yeah, you can donate like rye grass to her.

1265
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,120
And people are memeing it because people are donating so much to her.

1266
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,860
They're drawing her like under tons.

1267
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,600
I think she got donated tons of rye grass.

1268
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,060
Yeah, and then like, they took a picture of it and you see her like looking at the grass be like, oh.

1269
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:31,940
Yeah.

1270
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,780
It looked like an eye spark.

1271
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,940
I was like, oh, I don't know why I'm getting so much grass, but yippee.

1272
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:44,000
I think people like it because like, um, because she's, first of all, she's a cute pink haired anime girl in the game.

1273
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,120
And in real life, apparently she like never won a single game.

1274
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,980
Yeah, yeah.

1275
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:54,460
Like, um, the lore, like I was saying like, the lore between the actual horses is like so much more interesting.

1276
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:54,980
It is.

1277
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,460
Than the, the, the horse anime girls.

1278
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,040
Yeah.

1279
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,840
Cause like, you know, like Gold Ship, the shit that comes out from Gold Ship.

1280
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,440
Like they said, like, he actually has an IQ of a seven year old.

1281
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,540
Um, yeah.

1282
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,300
Cause like the average IQ for horses is like four year old.

1283
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:09,900
Uh huh.

1284
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,160
And Gold Ship was like one of the rare horses that like has the IQ of a seven year old.

1285
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,000
And he was like super, super fucking smart.

1286
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,040
So like some, if he wants to win, he'll win, but sometimes he just doesn't want it.

1287
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,580
Yeah.

1288
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,840
It costs like 12 billion yen or something in one race.

1289
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,600
Oh yeah.

1290
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:25,980
Yeah.

1291
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:37,320
And then apparently every horse that has like made a, like every horse that's like a child of Gold Ship was like considered like real, like a winner basically.

1292
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah.

1293
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,780
Cause you need to pay 2 million yen to breed Gold Ship.

1294
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,940
What the fuck?

1295
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,300
Yeah.

1296
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,360
That's kind of nice.

1297
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:45,740
Yeah.

1298
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:54,100
And then apparently he has like a, every horse that has like bred with Gold Ship is like 100% like there's a baby.

1299
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,540
Like.

1300
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,000
So everyone's like, yeah, he like, he's like guaranteed.

1301
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:00,800
Like.

1302
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,200
Wow.

1303
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,240
What a funny horse.

1304
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,520
Cause like in the game.

1305
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:05,760
Yeah, he's a silly horse.

1306
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,800
Gold Ship is like very, what's the word?

1307
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,200
Molatile.

1308
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,440
Cause it kind of makes sense.

1309
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:11,800
Yeah.

1310
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,100
But some of the lore is kind of sad.

1311
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,220
Like one of the horses that I got first, the anime girl horse.

1312
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,480
Rice Shower, right?

1313
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,340
She's super cute.

1314
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,540
And I'm like, oh, I was telling Chad, I love Rice Shower.

1315
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,960
And everyone's like, oh, she doesn't know.

1316
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,800
She doesn't know the lore.

1317
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,960
The Rice Shower lore.

1318
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,640
That Rice Shower got euthanized when they were like six years old because they broke a leg or something.

1319
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
I'm like, that's fucking sad.

1320
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,880
That's just sad.

1321
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,160
What?

1322
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,740
I didn't know that.

1323
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,060
So sad.

1324
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,680
Oh my God.

1325
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,740
That's so sad.

1326
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,420
The dark underbelly of horse racing.

1327
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,100
Yeah.

1328
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:41,720
Oh yeah.

1329
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,400
Cause they're like based off the real horses and everything.

1330
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:44,980
Yeah.

1331
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,460
I'm okay with the anime girls.

1332
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,600
He's like, you know what?

1333
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,900
I just want to know about the anime girls.

1334
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,740
I just want to be happy.

1335
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,580
I...

1336
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,560
No.

1337
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,160
Doki Bird is a great horse name by the...

1338
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,160
I think Doki Bird is a good horse name.

1339
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:01,740
There it goes.

1340
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,300
There goes Doki Bird.

1341
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,280
And she's catching up.

1342
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:04,840
Doki Bird.

1343
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,120
Doki Bird.

1344
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,640
I don't know if you're saying it like that.

1345
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,260
Oh my God.

1346
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,140
I've seen like...

1347
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,880
People were like, I can't wait when they add these new horses.

1348
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,920
And then one of the...

1349
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,060
Like these American horses.

1350
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,100
There was one that was like...

1351
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,680
Like his name was literally Fortnite.

1352
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:18,940
Fortnite.

1353
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,120
Right?

1354
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:20,780
There's...

1355
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:21,660
Fortnite?

1356
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,360
There's also Skibbidi Riz now.

1357
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:23,700
Oh yeah.

1358
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,140
Skibbidi Riz.

1359
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,420
I want to see Skibbidi Riz and Umamu.

1360
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,380
Skibbidi Riz.

1361
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,820
I don't know how they're going to say it, but it's going to be really funny.

1362
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,400
Skibbidi Riz though.

1363
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:44,740
Yeah.

1364
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,480
And you know like when...

1365
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,400
When they add like foreigners into like a Japanese anime game.

1366
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:50,920
Yeah.

1367
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,520
Oh, that kind of English?

1368
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,180
Yeah.

1369
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:54,900
Yeah.

1370
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,620
That would be really fun.

1371
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,040
Yeah.

1372
00:45:59,240 --> 00:45:59,860
I love horse game.

1373
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,920
I kind of like it.

1374
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,140
It kind of makes me happy when I see a lot of like...

1375
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,740
Streamers or whoever, right?

1376
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,500
You get unified with like one game.

1377
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,280
Oh, yeah.

1378
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,220
Yeah.

1379
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,420
Like Ludwig had that Umamu Summit tournament recently.

1380
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,220
Mm-hmm.

1381
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,520
Just stuff like this is fun to see, you know?

1382
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,700
Like more games.

1383
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,360
Yeah, yeah.

1384
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,660
It's like, you know, all these people who like normally don't interact with each other.

1385
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,040
Yeah.

1386
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,000
But like the horse game was different.

1387
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:33,160
It's kind of like, um, gosh, I still remember the summer of 2016 when Pokemon Go unified the world.

1388
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,580
Do you remember that?

1389
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,520
The era of peace.

1390
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,760
The era of peace where everyone was like actually going outside.

1391
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,240
Yeah.

1392
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,740
Everyone was outside.

1393
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,480
And everyone was on her phone.

1394
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,680
You could tell like, like event was happening.

1395
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,160
Yeah.

1396
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,780
Everyone was just around that certain area too.

1397
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,760
And strangers were so nice to each other.

1398
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,600
They're like, oh, bro, there's an aerodactyl over there.

1399
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,180
If you keep going.

1400
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:52,720
Thanks, bro.

1401
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,600
Like, you know, just four times.

1402
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,580
And then COVID ruined it all.

1403
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,100
I do think COVID did mess up some things.

1404
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:12,080
Oh my God, I found out recently, like, apparently, like, if you ever get COVID, like, like, you actually get dumber or something.

1405
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,480
Because did you see that article?

1406
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,940
I was like...

1407
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,600
No, I saw it.

1408
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,820
A lot of people got brain fog.

1409
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,200
They can't remember things.

1410
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,300
No, I saw it.

1411
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,100
And I'm like...

1412
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,680
Fuck.

1413
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,880
See, the thing is for me, I don't know if it's COVID or I'm just getting old.

1414
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:28,900
That's true.

1415
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,500
That's true.

1416
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,720
Because like, I had brain fog recently.

1417
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,080
But that was just because I was like, so fucking stressed out.

1418
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,020
And didn't like...

1419
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,060
Because I was like, planning for...

1420
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,500
Because I had my birthday this month.

1421
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,900
And I had my...

1422
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,460
And I had my...

1423
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,080
Another concert.

1424
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,560
And also like, birthday preparations.

1425
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,080
Mm-hmm.

1426
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,860
Because every day I was just so fucking busy.

1427
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,380
And then I was having brain fog.

1428
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,200
So it's like, is it because I'm getting old or because I'm stressed out?

1429
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:51,940
Like...

1430
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,380
Oh no.

1431
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,240
Or COVID.

1432
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,200
Or COVID.

1433
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,080
I think it's just like, a mix of everything, really.

1434
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,040
That's true.

1435
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:00,700
That's true.

1436
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,180
We're like, patient zero.

1437
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,700
But you do a lot of like, concerts.

1438
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,000
Well, it was mostly for...

1439
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,940
Like, I only done two.

1440
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,240
So I've done one for November.

1441
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,740
And then the other one was, you know, for...

1442
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,680
It was for my birthday for Anime Expo.

1443
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,220
Uh-huh.

1444
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,940
Because I got invited to Anime Expo.

1445
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,200
And like, the concert thing was like, my own idea.

1446
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,420
So I was like, oh, you know, like...

1447
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,080
Because like, there's like, people who don't know who I am.

1448
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,340
So I figured like, oh, 3D concert is a great way to advertise yourself.

1449
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,860
Can I ask about that?

1450
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,820
I was always curious.

1451
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,220
Yeah.

1452
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,560
When VTubers do like, 3D concerts and stuff.

1453
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,140
Like, how does that...

1454
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,300
Are you like, singing live?

1455
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,160
Is it recorded?

1456
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:35,960
Like, are you there?

1457
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,680
Like, how is it going?

1458
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,360
Oh, okay.

1459
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:44,520
So it depends on like, depends really on the VTubers and how the concert venue is.

1460
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:51,500
But like, so sometimes you can tell if it's like, pre-recorded with like, the singing and stuff.

1461
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:57,960
Usually, the go-to would be like, pre-recorded singing, and then the dances could be live.

1462
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,680
Or like, both of them are pre-recorded, or you do them, and you do the MC live.

1463
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,000
So...

1464
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,440
Or like, the entire thing is pre-recorded.

1465
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,200
So it really depends.

1466
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:08,840
Like, there's a...

1467
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,320
It depends...

1468
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,420
It is a mix and match between like, the time availability, and like, budget and everything.

1469
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,900
Because like, doing a lot...

1470
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,080
Everything live is so risky.

1471
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,900
No, I understand.

1472
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,020
Especially because you have to like, set up all the things beforehand.

1473
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:20,620
Yeah.

1474
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,360
I did a concert, like, in person a few years ago.

1475
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,880
And it was the most terrifying thing.

1476
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,940
I have bad stage fright.

1477
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:26,880
Performance anxiety.

1478
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,220
So I look at...

1479
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,380
And then afterwards, I learned that people do V2 concerts.

1480
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:32,080
Yeah.

1481
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:32,900
And I started watching them.

1482
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,560
And I'm like, wait, that's so fucking sick.

1483
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,700
Yeah.

1484
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,380
Like, the motion capture and everything.

1485
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,360
And then you have different camera angles and stuff you can do.

1486
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,860
And because like...

1487
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,600
That's why it's very hard to tell when something's like, live or pre-recorded.

1488
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,000
Because you can do like, different camera angles while it's live.

1489
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,080
So...

1490
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,480
So...

1491
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,320
But like...

1492
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:50,820
And...

1493
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:50,900
Yeah.

1494
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,420
But usually, singing is done pre-recorded.

1495
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,360
Just because it's very hard to...

1496
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,540
No, I understand that too.

1497
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,700
I think it's so cool though.

1498
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:00,740
Like...

1499
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,720
Wow, technology has come so far.

1500
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,420
Do you need a 3D model to do the concert?

1501
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,600
Um...

1502
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,080
Well...

1503
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,160
Yeah.

1504
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,400
I mean, it is a 3D concert.

1505
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,320
But like, you can do it with 2D.

1506
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,560
But like, you know, if you have a guest that doesn't have a 3D model.

1507
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,440
You can like, you know, get the 2D model in as well.

1508
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,480
And then they just...

1509
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,860
On a screen or something.

1510
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,500
And you sing with them while they're on the screen.

1511
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,340
Or they're like, you know, the 2D model itself.

1512
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,200
And you just move around it with the 2D model.

1513
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:28,620
Uh-huh.

1514
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,760
But it is possible.

1515
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,580
It is possible.

1516
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,540
But it is...

1517
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:31,920
Oh my gosh.

1518
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,680
Have you ever been in a mocap suit?

1519
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,480
No, but it sounds really fun.

1520
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,300
Oh my god.

1521
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:37,840
There's like...

1522
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,820
There's so much stuff you have to put on.

1523
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,920
And we like sit there for like, I think like 30 minutes.

1524
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,620
Just having them put everything on.

1525
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,060
And then like...

1526
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:47,920
But it's so cool.

1527
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,080
Like seeing yourself on the screen with the 3D model and moving yourself with it.

1528
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,200
It's just such a cool experience.

1529
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,600
Oh my, that's so sick.

1530
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:54,620
In general.

1531
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,100
Yeah.

1532
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,240
And then I know like technology has evolved so much.

1533
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:58,800
Because I saw...

1534
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,160
Have you ever saw that video of someone like motion capturing a horse?

1535
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,160
What?

1536
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Yeah, you never saw it.

1537
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:04,720
No.

1538
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,940
I don't remember which game it was.

1539
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:06,980
But...

1540
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,920
They like motion captured a horse.

1541
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:14,960
And you see the horse wearing the little 3D outfit with the hat too.

1542
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,080
Like the little...

1543
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,540
That's really cute actually.

1544
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,840
Yeah, it's so cute.

1545
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,560
Because you know how...

1546
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:21,820
You know Stray?

1547
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,800
The game Stray?

1548
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,020
Yeah, the cat.

1549
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,680
Yeah, they motion capture the cat for that.

1550
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,520
Oh my god.

1551
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,320
No wonder the cat looks so good.

1552
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,340
Yeah, yeah.

1553
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,180
So there's like videos of the motion capture of the cat.

1554
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,680
And like them leading the cat everywhere.

1555
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,320
Like okay, cross this little bench thing.

1556
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,360
It's like a little bench thing.

1557
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,360
And everything.

1558
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,840
It's so cool seeing stuff like that.

1559
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:43,860
Wow.

1560
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,920
Okay, thank you.

1561
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,100
I was always just curious about that.

1562
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,340
That sounds really cool.

1563
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,340
Yeah.

1564
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,240
And like...

1565
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,920
But yeah, like technology has just come so far when it comes to like 3D in general.

1566
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,240
So it's really fun.

1567
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:56,880
You should always...

1568
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,460
Honestly, you should give it a try.

1569
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,220
I want to.

1570
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,300
Like that should be on your bucket list.

1571
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,720
That is definitely on my...

1572
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,900
I've always wanted a 3D model.

1573
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:03,740
And the mocap.

1574
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,660
That sounds awesome.

1575
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,540
Oh, yeah.

1576
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,060
Yeah.

1577
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,400
He's like...

1578
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:07,800
Oh, sorry.

1579
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,020
Go on.

1580
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,380
No, no.

1581
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:08,880
You go first.

1582
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,320
You go first.

1583
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,620
No, it's okay.

1584
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,500
You go first.

1585
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,960
I think it's cool that you can express yourself without having to show yourself.

1586
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:20,660
You know?

1587
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,260
Oh, yeah.

1588
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,700
Because I think showing yourself comes with its whole can of worms as well.

1589
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,020
Yeah.

1590
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:25,680
Yeah.

1591
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,740
For me, I'm like...

1592
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,020
That's why I love VTubing.

1593
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,900
Because like, in real life, I'm actually a really private person.

1594
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,860
No, that makes sense.

1595
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:32,400
Yeah.

1596
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:38,740
So like, I've only like met IRL in terms of like people that I've like done stuff with.

1597
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:44,620
I've only met like three people in real life that I like connected with via VTubing.

1598
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,460
Because like, for me, I'm like, I'm super private.

1599
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,920
Like, I don't tell people where I live.

1600
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,200
I just be like, I live in Canada.

1601
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:49,560
You know?

1602
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:03,960
But like, no one really knows like where I live or like, like, basically off stream what like, I really do or stuff like that.

1603
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,360
And it's just like, I just like the privacy and things.

1604
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,580
So like, when I'm outside, I don't have to worry about being approached and stuff.

1605
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,320
Yeah.

1606
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,900
So it's like, I never had had that.

1607
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,100
I guess like, for you, it's different because like, you've been a public figure for a very long time.

1608
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,820
Do.

1609
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:20,740
Mm.

1610
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:26,620
At some point, I kind of like, envy that kind of like privacy because, um, like you're safe in real life.

1611
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,260
Yeah.

1612
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:27,580
Yeah.

1613
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:27,880
Yeah.

1614
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,780
You are safe.

1615
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,720
And I think it prevents people from getting a little too weird with you.

1616
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:33,980
Right?

1617
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,640
Mm-hmm.

1618
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:35,060
Yeah.

1619
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,240
You have that strong boundary.

1620
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,120
I think that's really cool.

1621
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:43,580
But you can also like express yourself just as well, because like, you have so many outfits, you have a lot of models and like facial expressions and everything.

1622
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,580
Like people know what your intents are.

1623
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,320
And I think that's really good.

1624
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,900
Unfortunately for me, I started when VTubing wasn't a thing.

1625
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,680
Would you, would you have been like just a primarily VTuber if you were around that area when you started content creation?

1626
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,580
In my twenties?

1627
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,160
Yes.

1628
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,300
Because I was a lot more shy and my self-confidence wasn't as high.

1629
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,580
I think it also kind of fucked me sometimes because like, um, back when I started, right?

1630
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,820
There wasn't, you know, the whole voice thing.

1631
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:11,540
Oh.

1632
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,220
Yeah.

1633
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:12,880
I remember that.

1634
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:12,940
Yeah.

1635
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,980
Now, like, you know, people who have high pitched voices, it's like dime a dozen.

1636
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:16,820
Who the fuck cares?

1637
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,060
Yeah.

1638
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,380
Right.

1639
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,160
But back then it was like me and like maybe Nyan or something.

1640
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,500
Oh, yeah.

1641
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,060
That's true.

1642
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:22,580
Yeah.

1643
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,620
So I think we got a lot of the attention, both good and bad.

1644
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:32,060
And that really fucked with 20 year old Lily because I'm like, oh, they would constantly say like, show yourself or you're ugly.

1645
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,400
Like, you got to show yourself.

1646
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,780
They're the constant pressuring.

1647
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So I'm like, okay, maybe if I show myself, it'll stop.

1648
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,120
Yeah.

1649
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:39,880
And it did not stop.

1650
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,540
Then they just called me ugly.

1651
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,120
Oh, yeah.

1652
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,940
It was like a lose-lose situation.

1653
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:45,220
Yeah.

1654
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,980
You can like appease everyone because there's so many people on the internet.

1655
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,500
You'll get like, you'll have aunties no matter what.

1656
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah, exactly.

1657
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,000
Even though you do like everything right.

1658
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,380
No matter what.

1659
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,080
Everyone has aunties.

1660
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,960
Someone will hate you for something.

1661
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,360
That's what I learned later on.

1662
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,040
I'm like, you don't, you don't have to do anything and people will just hate you.

1663
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,880
So we might as well live your life how you want to live your life.

1664
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:05,260
Right?

1665
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,480
And just be like, oh yeah, your voice.

1666
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,460
Cause like, I understand that because like, I also have like a very polarizing voice as well.

1667
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:17,500
Cause like for me as a, cause like, you know, like the general VTuber voice is like higher pitch and everything.

1668
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:25,360
So like when I debuted people were like, oh my gosh, her voice is like, like so ugly or something like that.

1669
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,760
Like, which is crazy to me, but yeah.

1670
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,140
Cause it's like, cause like I have such a unique voice.

1671
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,160
And people would be like, oh my gosh, like why does she sound like that?

1672
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:33,440
Like.

1673
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:34,580
Yeah.

1674
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,120
I don't.

1675
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,200
It's just a redundant.

1676
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,500
Why does she sound like that?

1677
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,540
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1678
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,480
Yeah.

1679
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:41,560
Yeah.

1680
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,180
So like, I get that feeling.

1681
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:52,380
Cause like, um, now nowadays people are like, oh, like when you're lower pitch, like when you're like not a very high pitch voice, then people will also judge you now too.

1682
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,940
So I get that.

1683
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,940
I'm just learning that people judge you no matter what.

1684
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,180
Yeah.

1685
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,900
High pitch, low pitch, unique voice, a basic voice.

1686
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,720
Who the fuck cares?

1687
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,700
Like it doesn't fucking matter.

1688
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,640
Someone's gonna hate you in the end.

1689
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,220
Someone's gonna hate you in the end.

1690
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:02,880
So it doesn't matter.

1691
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:03,500
Be yourself.

1692
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,320
That's like, yeah.

1693
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,960
Like when you're getting into content creation, like you're, you're gonna get haters in the end no matter what.

1694
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,160
And it's just about testing your like mental fortitude.

1695
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,420
And like you're, you're skinny.

1696
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:15,680
Yeah.

1697
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,920
So I have to have tough skin to get into this business.

1698
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:18,740
Mm-hmm.

1699
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,280
And I think people value authenticity anyway.

1700
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:27,780
Like if you're yourself, people like that instead of like pretending to be who you're not or whatever.

1701
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,300
That's so true.

1702
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:28,600
Yeah.

1703
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,600
And then there's like, but there's also like, oh, there's like VTubers out there though.

1704
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:39,480
That does like, um, you know, like the ones that like rely, like play heavily into the lore itself too, which is really interesting.

1705
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,100
That's really cool though.

1706
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,240
Like they're playing a character.

1707
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,020
Yeah.

1708
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,100
And I think that's really cool.

1709
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,460
I, I, I like, yeah, I think so too.

1710
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,980
Like I don't, I could never do that.

1711
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:47,760
Like I always crack.

1712
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:52,740
Like whenever I have to like play, I can't like upkeep it for too long.

1713
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,160
And I just, I just crack.

1714
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,900
I just be like, I can't guys.

1715
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,740
It's like, um, like an actor, you know, like you're entertaining people at the end of the day.

1716
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,060
So however you go about it, as long as you're not hurting anyone else.

1717
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:08,720
Yeah.

1718
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,880
Oh yeah.

1719
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,440
It's all about like, you know, as long as like the audience like it, the community likes it.

1720
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,620
Like that's all that matters in the end.

1721
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,260
Yeah.

1722
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,940
And that's the moral of this podcast episode.

1723
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,780
Just be yourself or be completely different.

1724
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,880
Good segue.

1725
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:26,540
Good segue.

1726
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,420
We're near the end.

1727
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:34,480
Um, usually for this podcast, people submit like stories they want advice on.

1728
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,400
If you, if you'd like to help me with, um, giving advice for one of them to end it off.

1729
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:39,920
Yeah.

1730
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,240
Sure.

1731
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:40,560
Okay.

1732
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,320
Like, should I swap to the crow for that?

1733
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,520
Get advice from a crow.

1734
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,180
Let me, let me pull that up.

1735
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,340
The croaky.

1736
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,640
That's what we call the crow, like croaky.

1737
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:59,660
Um, it was started, it was just a joke, like a one off thing, but then everyone was like, wait, this is actually pretty funny.

1738
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,800
That's how it always starts with a joke.

1739
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,980
And then it becomes real.

1740
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:03,800
Yeah.

1741
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:04,120
Yeah.

1742
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,660
People were like, wait, she, like the crow actually, like your voice really matches the crow.

1743
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,960
We love croaky.

1744
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,680
You do have a very like unique voice.

1745
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,440
It's very unique.

1746
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,640
And I think it's very cute.

1747
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,100
Yeah.

1748
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:27,240
Like for me, like whenever I'm at like convention, I can't speak because like, I actually got recognized one time when I was at a convention.

1749
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,340
Cause I, I was stupid.

1750
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,640
I was trying to find my own merch.

1751
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,780
Oh, okay.

1752
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,120
That's on you.

1753
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,220
That's on me.

1754
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,120
I was like, they won't know.

1755
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,740
And then, and then they're like, wait a minute.

1756
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,600
Are you, are you dokey bird?

1757
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,400
And I was like, no, I'm just a big fan.

1758
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:50,440
I'm just, I just, I just, I just really love dokey bird.

1759
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:55,500
Like I purposely like pitched my voice higher when they asked me.

1760
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,320
And she was like, no, they won't.

1761
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,360
They'll never know.

1762
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,960
I think they knew, but they'll never know.

1763
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,440
Voices are quite recognizable in person.

1764
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,000
I've learned.

1765
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:07,740
Yeah.

1766
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,280
Oh yeah.

1767
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:08,960
A hundred percent.

1768
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:15,520
Oh, you make me want more outfits and you make me want a 3D model and you make me want to do a concert and you make me want to do it.

1769
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,960
Why don't you just do it all?

1770
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,240
I want to do it.

1771
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:20,340
Inspiring.

1772
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:20,440
Inspiring.

1773
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,200
It's so inspiring.

1774
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,920
And then, and then, and then.

1775
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:23,160
Yeah.

1776
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:23,980
And then what?

1777
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,260
And then you'll record the song I wrote.

1778
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,620
And that is when.

1779
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:28,860
No.

1780
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,660
The only reason I, I pester you so much, it's cause like, it's one of the songs I wrote that I'm like so, I love it so much.

1781
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,400
I need, I need you to sing this man.

1782
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,980
I need you to sing it now.

1783
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,180
Like I like stop.

1784
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,080
TJ and I want you to sing it so bad.

1785
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,000
We're like, we hope she still wants to do it.

1786
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah.

1787
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:47,880
It's okay.

1788
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,460
Now, now I have time.

1789
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,160
My, my other stuff is done.

1790
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,500
I can finally, I finally have time to record it.

1791
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,080
While she's changing, I'm going to give listeners context.

1792
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:57,920
Okay.

1793
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,780
She asked me to write a song a few years ago, two years ago.

1794
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,680
I don't remember when.

1795
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:03,580
So I'm like, okay.

1796
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,360
So I started doing this deep dive into Doki Bird, right?

1797
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,700
And her lore and like who she is as a person.

1798
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:12,120
And I'm like, like, I need to know her soul.

1799
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,400
And I want to write this song.

1800
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,660
It's a very like emotional song.

1801
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,040
It's very, very emotional.

1802
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,420
It's really good.

1803
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,900
Like a good meaning to it, you know?

1804
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,000
And then, and then TJ had this draft and I'm like, oh my God, it's so cute.

1805
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,440
I can't wait to see her see it.

1806
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:26,780
Me too.

1807
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:31,760
I'm glad, I'm glad we finally, we finally, um, had all that.

1808
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,840
Set up for it too.

1809
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,600
Mm-hmm.

1810
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,000
Okay.

1811
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,700
I'm so excited.

1812
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:35,940
Wait, I'm sorry.

1813
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:36,720
I.

1814
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,140
Oh, wait.

1815
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:38,620
Okay.

1816
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,240
There you go.

1817
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:40,900
Wait, I'm.

1818
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,960
You have set up my expectations show.

1819
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,860
So different.

1820
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,660
Um, I.

1821
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:49,580
What?

1822
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,080
It's a crow.

1823
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,600
It's literally a MSPaint crow.

1824
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,000
No.

1825
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,600
No, it's 3D.

1826
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,460
I just can't get the tracking to work.

1827
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,420
Oh my God.

1828
01:00:58,820 --> 01:00:59,560
Oh my God.

1829
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,480
It's 3D, but I can't.

1830
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,560
Look, see?

1831
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,480
Oh, it's 3D.

1832
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:04,740
Okay.

1833
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,780
Oh my God.

1834
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,140
I swear to God, when, if the tracking works, it's so good.

1835
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:10,680
No, I see the vision.

1836
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,560
I see the vision.

1837
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,320
You see the vision?

1838
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,880
Yeah, no, I see the vision to the audio listeners.

1839
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,360
It is a 3D model of a crow and it looks really...

1840
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,440
I can imagine it being very cool if it moves the way it's supposed to.

1841
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,600
Yeah, if it moves the way it's supposed to move, it'd be so cool.

1842
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,640
It would be super sick, yeah.

1843
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,180
It would've been so sick.

1844
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,600
But sadly, sadly, it did not move the way it took me to try and get it to work.

1845
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,500
But sadly, it did not.

1846
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,680
It's been so long that I forgot how to get it to work.

1847
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,040
It is okay.

1848
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,240
From my perspective, it was like, oh, it's...

1849
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,520
A 2D crow.

1850
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,860
Okay, like...

1851
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,960
I swear to God.

1852
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:49,480
No, no, no.

1853
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,080
I believe you.

1854
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:50,720
I believe you.

1855
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,060
It was so funny.

1856
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,560
Okay, bring back Doki Bird.

1857
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,840
Okay, but what if I'm just like this?

1858
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,700
What if I...

1859
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,120
You could just do that.

1860
01:01:59,220 --> 01:01:59,880
That's funny too.

1861
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,460
Wait, that's so cute.

1862
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,280
A 3D crow is really cute.

1863
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,060
I want a 3D Pomeranian.

1864
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,660
You can get one.

1865
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:08,540
Those are...

1866
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,080
Like, 3D models are actually...

1867
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:10,640
Well, it depends.

1868
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:10,960
It depends.

1869
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,220
I think for, like, mascots and stuff, it's a lot cheaper.

1870
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,180
How...

1871
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,260
Can I ask how much your 3D model was?

1872
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,300
Um...

1873
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,760
For, like, the regular size?

1874
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,620
Regular sized.

1875
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,520
Um...

1876
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,700
It was, like, around...

1877
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,040
In...

1878
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:22,480
10k.

1879
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,020
But that's for, like, motion...

1880
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,120
Like, for mocap too.

1881
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,380
10k.

1882
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,360
Okay, got it.

1883
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:30,860
Um...

1884
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,380
Yeah, cause, like, um...

1885
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:33,500
Um...

1886
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,100
Cause, like, they have to build it to work for motion capture.

1887
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,580
Cause, like, it's cheaper if it's just a normal 3D model without the motion capture.

1888
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,660
But the technology for that is, like, a less... a lot more different.

1889
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,240
Mm-hmm.

1890
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,660
But if it's, like...

1891
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:46,880
Um...

1892
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,100
But if it's mostly for...

1893
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,400
Like, if you want to have motion capture and use it for normal VTubing.

1894
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:54,000
Like, you know, like, at your desk and stuff like that.

1895
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,780
Then it's a lot cheaper.

1896
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:56,960
Got it.

1897
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:57,260
Okay.

1898
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:57,800
Yeah.

1899
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:58,300
Thank you.

1900
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:58,760
Alright, I'm back.

1901
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,740
Alright, let's get this advice segment underway.

1902
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,900
You can see it on the screen, right?

1903
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,480
Yeah, I can.

1904
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,420
Okay, we only read a paragraph at a time.

1905
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,940
Like, me, you, me, you.

1906
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:08,580
Okay.

1907
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,840
I got the shorter paragraph.

1908
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,080
Oh, do you want the bigger...

1909
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:11,680
No, that's fine.

1910
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,140
No, that's fine.

1911
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,360
I like the shorter one.

1912
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,500
Less reading for me.

1913
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:14,920
Okay.

1914
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,800
How to deal with a questionable friend.

1915
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:22,120
I met my current friend group through Discord and eventually moved interstate, partly motivated by wanting to be closer to them.

1916
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,600
Early on, I got really close with a girl, Kim, who started the Discord.

1917
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,900
We talked and played games a lot and she had known the group in real life for a couple years already.

1918
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:35,320
But as we got closer, she would often talk badly about others in the group, which felt really disrespectful.

1919
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:40,160
Kim had a habit of getting upset over misunderstandings, sometimes her fault, sometimes not.

1920
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,040
And she would lash out or ghost people.

1921
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,560
After a serious talk with her, our dynamic changed and we slowly drifted apart.

1922
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:53,620
When I started dating someone in the group, who she used to ship us when my BF and I were still friends, but suddenly did a complete 180 and was completely against it.

1923
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,840
It felt like she wasn't happy about it and distanced herself more.

1924
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,400
Our friends even noticed her acting weird toward us.

1925
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:06,000
What really made me lose trust was when she told me she hated one of our friends, but was only putting up with her because of the guy she was dating.

1926
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,960
The guy is one of Kim's other close friends.

1927
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:12,140
They eventually broke up, but stayed close friends.

1928
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,800
And Kim started hanging out more with the girl she said she hated, which felt fake.

1929
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,940
Some people in the group know what she said, but have not confronted her, which bothers me.

1930
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:27,420
I even asked a girl Kim talked about if she would want to know if someone was bad at talking her.

1931
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,340
But she said no, because it might cause drama and backlash.

1932
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,620
So I respect her decision and stay quiet.

1933
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,320
Now Kim has ghosted both me and my boyfriend.

1934
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,760
I do not trust her and don't see us ever being friends again.

1935
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,340
I still care about the group, but it's hard when no one addresses the toxic stuff.

1936
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,540
Things are kind of divided now and feels like our friends walk on eggshells.

1937
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,020
Even birthday outings are split between her and us.

1938
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:52,300
I feel bad for my friends and especially for my boyfriend who was part of the original group, but now feels left out.

1939
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,900
Lately, I've been thinking about finding new friends.

1940
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,620
We've all been close for five years, but now I don't really feel like I belong anymore.

1941
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:02,160
And I don't know if I can get past them accepting that kind of toxic behavior.

1942
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,760
Thank you for reading all this.

1943
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,640
Hope it wasn't too long.

1944
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:04,900
Okay.

1945
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,080
I need a summary of this.

1946
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:06,640
I'm sorry.

1947
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:07,920
Okay.

1948
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,180
She met her current friend group through discord.

1949
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:10,700
Yeah.

1950
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,860
And moved closer to them, got close with a girl named Kim who started the discord.

1951
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:15,340
Okay.

1952
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,400
So they're being friends, but she would also shit talk other people in the group.

1953
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:19,600
Yeah.

1954
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:19,960
Okay.

1955
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:20,040
Okay.

1956
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,940
That's not good for Kim.

1957
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,120
Okay.

1958
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,040
And she lashes out.

1959
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,000
They drifted apart.

1960
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:33,240
And then the praise, and then the OP, I'm going to call them OP, started dating someone in the group, which who Kim used to chip.

1961
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:33,560
What?

1962
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,120
And she wasn't happy about it.

1963
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,320
She acted weird.

1964
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:40,600
And then she told me that she hated one of our friends, but was putting, oh my God.

1965
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:40,800
Okay.

1966
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:44,460
This sounds like she's really toxic and like, you're okay without her, man.

1967
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:44,900
Yeah.

1968
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,500
Yeah.

1969
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,980
Honestly, like I would just cut that.

1970
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,920
No, I would also just cut that.

1971
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,340
Because like the group is enabling her toxic behavior too.

1972
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,980
Because they're like, it's okay.

1973
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,900
As long as it doesn't affect us, then it's fine.

1974
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:56,740
You know?

1975
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,720
And they're like, like, you know, like in one of it, she's like, she talked shit about one of the other friends.

1976
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:04,840
And the friend was like, I don't want to know if anyone's talking shit about me.

1977
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,580
So like, they are all like living in this like little bubble.

1978
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,560
Little bubble.

1979
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:10,860
Yeah.

1980
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,020
Like to keep the peace.

1981
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:12,700
Yeah.

1982
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,080
Yeah.

1983
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:14,420
And that's not healthy at all.

1984
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:21,700
Because like, she's obviously, this Kim person is obviously going to keep doing what she's doing because she's not being punished for it.

1985
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,960
And she's basically being like a mean girl in general.

1986
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:27,280
So like, it's just not healthy mentally wise too.

1987
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:32,460
Because you're always going like, who's like, oh, like, someone's going to be a snake today towards me or something.

1988
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,700
Oh my God.

1989
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,640
That was really good, Doki.

1990
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,480
That was really good.

1991
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,160
Good, solid advice.

1992
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,120
Holy shit.

1993
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,200
I did not accept it.

1994
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,680
That would be like $5 for your therapy session.

1995
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:51,040
I think it's also good to tell the group, like, you know, just make your boundaries clear.

1996
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,900
Like, hey, I don't fuck with Kim, blah, blah, blah.

1997
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,500
It's up to you guys what you guys want to do.

1998
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:54,740
Yeah.

1999
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,940
This is my boundary, right?

2000
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,500
And then, you know, protect your peace too, you know?

2001
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:58,980
Yeah.

2002
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,520
And be like, it's just not healthy.

2003
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,480
Like, if they're like wondering, oh, why did she leave?

2004
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,400
Like, why isn't she hanging out with us anymore?

2005
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:10,220
Like, if they're asking that about OP, just keep it straight and be like, the vibe was just not it.

2006
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:17,500
It was so mentally draining to be part of this group because everyone was like, you know, like, people were being like manipulative and stuff.

2007
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:22,020
So like, why would I want to hang out with a group of people that I'm not vibing with anymore?

2008
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:23,520
Yeah.

2009
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,520
I got no other...

2010
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:24,840
Yeah.

2011
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:25,660
Because you want to look forward.

2012
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:30,680
Like, if you're going to be a group of friends, you want, you know, be with a group of friends that make you happy and not like something...

2013
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:30,940
Yeah.

2014
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:31,860
Happy and comfortable.

2015
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,340
Not like dread every time.

2016
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,360
You know?

2017
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:35,720
Wait.

2018
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:36,640
Yeah.

2019
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,060
I got...

2020
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,440
I got no more notes.

2021
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,420
Hey, thank you for submitting.

2022
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,120
That was really good.

2023
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,060
Very good.

2024
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,060
And that is the end of the episode.

2025
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,240

We were yapping all hour.

2031
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,540
It was so fun.

2032
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,460
The time flew by.

2033
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,500
It did, really.

2034

She's a very good VTube streamer.

2042
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,160
I would advise it.

2043
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:15,840
Thank you.

2044
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:15,960
Yay!

2045
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,040
See you on Patreon!

2046

Bye!

2047
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,940
Bye-bye, everyone!

2048
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,060
I'm gonna get ALC and Obama and this one.

2049
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,200
Stuff like that, you know?

2050
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,220
I'm like, oh...

2051
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:26,960
Sorry.

2052
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:31,800
I'm gonna be one of those insufferable Arcane fans who are like, You never watched Arcane?

2053
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,800
Like, what?

2054
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,340
It felt like the eating of someone's grandpa.
