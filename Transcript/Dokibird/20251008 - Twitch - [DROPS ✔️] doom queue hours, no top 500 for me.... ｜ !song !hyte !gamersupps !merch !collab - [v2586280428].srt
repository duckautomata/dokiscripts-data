Thank you.

12
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,240
I was like, wait, things are okay.

13
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
Things are going okay.

14
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,690
It's so sad.

15
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,950
I'm like, oh my God, Wait, I think I'm doing it, guys.

16
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,230
I'm doing it.

17
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,730
Things written back.

18
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,430
Not okay.

19
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,670
I almost had that feeling where I wanted to cry.

20
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,770
And I was like, I need a stream.

21
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,730
I need my emotional support dragoons right now.

22
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,190
Because I was this close to crying.

23
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,030
The reason why is that girl is always just imagine.

24
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,850
It's just points.

25
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,290
It's just like, you know.

26
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,030
What?

27
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:27,090
why is he barking i think you heard someone outside so um he heard he's hearing people outside close the door all right so actually no because what if he wants to no why are you not barking no you hear someone outside at like three in the morning so it's like what are you doing it's four it's it's 343 okay so basically um you guys are like oh it's just rake numbers Why are you so sad?

28
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,890
It's because I spent so much time playing.

29
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,210
That's the thing.

30
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,770
I was so close so many times.

31
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,030
And then the thing is, like, not sleeping and playing ranked.

32
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,770
So I'm like, I can do it.

33
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,430
I think I can actually do it.

34
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,190
Because, like, at first I was just playing just to play.

35
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,110
Because, like, I was running away from my responsibilities, like, right now.

36
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,990
But I was like, wait, wait, I'm getting closer.

37
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,850
Wait, I think I can actually do it.

38
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:51,710
and then and then it made me so sad because i was like oh i spent so much time i spent so much time but i can't do it you know i have two i can't there's no way i don't think i can i need to get celestial two but it has to be a high celestial like okay this is me i'm celestial three i'm like I this is okay and then the cutoff is Celestio 2 so I don't I don't think I'm gonna make it I never never have hope never have hope I had hope for I don't know why I had to have hope never have hope so that's I was like really sad because I was like oh I could have used that time to work Oh my gosh,

39
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,190
there's only one thing that can make me feel a little better, too.

40
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,070
So I was like, oh, there's like, oh my gosh.

41
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,930
I could have used that time to, like, do work stuff instead.

42
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,890
I need this.

43
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,130
That's my backdrop, obviously.

44
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,530
I could have used this time to do work stuff instead of playing.

45
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,870
Tokyo, why did it?

46
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,850
And then instead of doing work stuff, I decided to stream Rivals instead.

47
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,230
I stopped posting my schedule for today, technically.

48
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,670
I was like, I'm just going to stream right now.

49
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,930
I need this.

50
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,770
You don't understand.

51
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,830
I need this right now.

52
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:35,490
I need my emotional support dragons right now to like give me strength.

53
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:47,890
Because I think like, I think if I didn't stream today, if I didn't stream, like after me accepting that was a top 500, I think I would have crashed out really, really hard.

54
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,650
I was crashing.

55
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,630
I was already crashing out.

56
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,310
But like, I would have crashed out.

57
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,830
even harder

58
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:52,770
so that's why I was like oh my god no that's tomorrow that's on Thursday sponsors at Thursday so that's why I'm like I'll queue and just whatever happens happens who cares if I derank and I keep deranking okay what grinds my queue is that I can't find anyone to play with me at this time because it's so degenerate time but it's like like people scrim they scrim and then like but and then when they're done scrimming i stream and like i'm streaming something else that's not marvel ribos and then when i'm done streaming my stuff they're done they're done playing people i know start playing rank or like they can only play a little bit and then it'll be like too late but it's like this is the only time i can play this is the only time I have like a very,

59
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:59,590
and then like, oh my god, people will only play if I'm streaming, but I want to play off stream too.

60
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,610
So it's very lonely.

61
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,310
It's very lonely up here.

62
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,430
So that's what grabs my gears.

63
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,410
DK, thank you for the five.

64
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,210

65
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,210

67
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,790
Give the toes.

68
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,450
Thank you, thank you.

69
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,530

70
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:52,430
success so yeah um I'm just gonna cue my sorrows away maybe I'll make new friends I don't know I maybe I'll make new friends zero out of 76 people online not a single not a single person online.

71
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,110
Jen, thank you for the raid.

72
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:55,790
Thank you.

73
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,790
Thank you.

74
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,130
I hope you had a good stream.

75
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,450
I'm so lonely, Mr. Lonely.

76
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,210
They sensed the doom queue.

77
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,210
But yeah, I'm ready.

78
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,310
I'm ready to queue my life away.

79
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,190
I mean, it is as I had three people online when I was queuing.

80
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,170
There were only three people online when I was queuing earlier.

81
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,510
It's so rough.

82
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,050
It's so rough.

83
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,170
But yes, that is why I'm streaming.

84
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,090
So I had to vent.

85
00:10:37,130 --> 00:11:23,970
I had to vent a little bit there because I was very, very sad when I, like, I accepted, you know, like, when you fully accepted that, like, I've hit my acceptance stage, you in denial at first and then anger i was very i went through the five stages of grief i'm at the acceptance stage i don't know what comes up i think that's the last stage right because i got angry i got very angry i was so angry bro i had a team that yelled at us for playing triple support and we lost fucking,

86
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:37,970
I don't know, we lost because the other team was doing 2-2 and then we lost because we had triple support and they're like, oh my god, you guys are so scummy and I was like, I broke my silence because our team actually only had three support players.

87
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,610
Like we, all three of us were only support mains.

88
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,970
So we had, it's not like we wanted to run triple support.

89
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,250
We couldn't play anything else.

90
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,770
So I was like, bro, like all our support means.

91
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,350
What do you want us to do?

92
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,090
Play Dank or DPS?

93
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,990
All three of us are support players.

94
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,450
Because they kept blaming us for playing triple support.

95
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,990
And I was like, bro, what's up?

96
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,390
Because we got several.

97
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,870
We actually had three support players for once.

98
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,810
Coincidentally, we had three people that actually could only play support.

99
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,310
So...

100
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:31,830
so i i was like i like broke my i like it broke the straw i was just like you because they kept blaming us for playing triple support

101
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:46,170
no i went through a lot of really shitty support players today it's okay venom can bring me joy

102
00:12:49,190 --> 00:14:03,850
but thank you yeah triple support is good but we had bad support players on triple support i hate we had we just didn't have really good players on triple support uh doge thank you for the tier one sub thank you thank you um i really appreciate it herb thank you for the hundred bitties thank you thank you uh yeah he shakes his he's shaking his me for emotional support um i this stream is preventing me from fully crashing out oh we're just like oh why haven't you slept because i i fucked up my sleep schedule a lot i think i might have to reset it today i'm gonna try i'm gonna try to stay up and fully reset my schedule because i do have a sponsor stream on thursday guys we might not have okay so i was gonna announce this later but i got invited to do it i can't say what it is at the moment i'll announce it um later but i i got invited to do a business trip um so i will be traveling later this week um so no there will be a stream tomorrow there will be a stream i'm just trying to try my

104
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:48,750
maybe I should put it on my stream looking for someone to doom queue with me.

105
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,230
So I can drag them down with me.

106
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,270
So we're like, oh, weren't you playing with Gomez earlier?

107
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,230
Yeah, but apparently he hasn't slept.

108
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,830
Like, he barely slept at all the last two days.

109
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,170
So I freed him.

110
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:17,790
he's no longer chained in my basement I was like you can go now I was like you can go now

111
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,530
you're be free

112
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:39,030
so um so that's I so that's I it's just I'm it's just me wallowing in my sorrows.

113
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,610
I was like, that was probably like, it's not gonna work.

114
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,770
It's not gonna happen anymore.

115
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,510
You are now freed.

116
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,930
I no longer, I will no longer chain you there with just, with just water.

117
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,330
Alright.

118
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,670
Free Willy.

119
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,790
Oh my god, we didn't pass Torch.

123
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,270
It was fine earlier.

124
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,090
What's wrong with you?

125
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,970

126
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,470
Okay.

127
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,250

00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,090
This sucks.

129
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,170
Wait, no, I did limit it.

130
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:52,510

136
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,670

137
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,030
Oh my god, this sucks.

138
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:04,910
I don't know.

139
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,130
I don't know why I'm lagging.

140
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,810
Oh my god, fucking curse.

141
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,750
We didn't ban torch them.

142
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,850
We didn't have a torch player.

143
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,790
See, this is my, these have been my games.

144
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,770
These have been, it's just RNG.

145
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,590
These have actually, these has been my games.

146
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,290
It's literally, literally, yeah.

147
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,490
Oh, there's the torch.

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,490
Yay.

149
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,170
Oh fucking curse, we don't have the actual torch.

154
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,490
That's fine.

155
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,810
I wanted to play.

156
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,370
I've been, like, playing mostly Luna lately.

157
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,110
Just because, like, I just can't be bothered.

158
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,370
Not Luna.

159
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,090
Uh, Invis.

160
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,930
Invis is just, it makes me feel happier.

161
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,570
Because it's, like, less pressure.

162
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,070
That's weird.

163
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,510
Usually, uh...

164
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,770

Oh!

192
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,450
That's unlucky.

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,030
I don't... We're just gonna die.

194
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,990
Let's just die together.

195
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,790
Well, that was a useless, useless ult.

196
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,550

00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,550
I would like to do not 240, maybe 160.

200
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,870
Hello, Spider-Man.

201
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,830
Your friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man.

202
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,810
I don't want to play Invis, but we have a Spider-Man.

203
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,870
Invis is so much less stressful.

204
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,550
I just push people away.

205
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,770
And it's, like, much more relaxing, you know?

206
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,510
Goodbye.

207
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,550
I'm a hero!

208
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,130
Remember me!

209
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,750
There you go.

210
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,930
I'm a hero.

211
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,070
Remember what I did.

212
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,230
No!

213
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:56,850
No!

214
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,950
Why me?

215
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,270
Why me?

216
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,070
Oh, thank God he's back.

217
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,750
He's back.

218
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,610
Yay!

219
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,570
He's back!

220
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,770
It's okay, he's back, guys.

221
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,910
He's back.

222
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,390
It's okay, he's back.

223
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,670
It's like nothing bad happens.

224
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:22,290
Scary.

225
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,110
That was scary.

226
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,770
It's okay, but he's back.

227
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,390
He's back.

228
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,230
Nothing to worry about.

229
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,250
Oh my gosh.

230
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,870
If I knew he was going to hook that, I would...

231
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,690
Okay, we got to help him, but...

232
00:21:38,810 --> 00:22:06,610
we couldn't finalize anything it's okay it'll be fine right oh i i should let rocket rocket you have all right rocket a whole rock okay i'll just stay here we'll just have rocket all at first there's no reason for me to all first this is better to engage.

233
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,870
Mine's is, like, defensive.

234
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,330
There you go.

235
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,790
See?

236
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,030
Oh, my God.

237
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:11,610
He lives.

238
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:12,710
Oh, goodbye.

239
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,470
Here you go.

240
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,470
You should be able to hit him, right?

241
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,490
I was going to be like, bro, that was a sick-ass freeze.

242
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,890
You should be able to hit that guy, right?

243
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,990
Rocket, please!

244
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,210
Rocket, I'm waiting for you!

245
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,950
Rocket, please!

246
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,070
How many people must we kill?

247
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,590
Oh, no.

248
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,150
I see.

249
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,330
He doesn't know I'm here, so I live.

250
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:41,630
Alright.

251
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,450
Oh, where is she?

252
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,330
Where did she go?

253
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,030
Where did she go?

254
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,190
Oh, they're running name more.

255
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,390
Those whores.

256
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,310
They're desperate to win, just like I'm not anymore.

257
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,570
I'm not.

258
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,090
I have a code for my crosshair.

259
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,610
Maybe.

260
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,590
When I'm not sad anymore, maybe I'll feel generous.

261
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,850
No!

262
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,330
It's fine, it's still winnable.

263
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,470
You might have Wolverine up, but it's fine.

264
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,330
It depends on how less sad I am.

265
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,650
If I'm to be generous, I'm dead.

266
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,770
Oh wait, no, I'm not dead.

267
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,530
I mean, we should just leave, honestly.

268
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,090
I just want... I'm just going to farm up from this guy.

269
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:41,450
Goodbye.

270
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,050
You're my alt battery.

271
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,750
Alright.

272
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,270
That sucks.

273
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,490
We should have fully cap that.

274
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,790
Okay, this Hulk is getting hard, buddy, though.

275
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,810
For sure.

276
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,110
Alright.

277
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,310
It's fine.

278
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,030
I'll take the squid on.

279
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,630
Who is over there?

280
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,890
Oh my, why?

281
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,010
How did he get over there?

282
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,110
First off, how did he fucking get over there?

283
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,150
All right, we're so...

284
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,470
Okay, I'm gonna save our...

285
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,050
I'm saving our health real fast.

286
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:26,450
All right, nice.

287
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,910
At least we got him out of the way.

288
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,590
All right, let's go back in again.

289
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,510
And you get a web and you get...

290
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,650
Oh, he is alive.

291
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,890
Oh, and I am not a- I'm live too.

292
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,370
No, he has a- he definitely has a- Oh,

293
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,430
I fucked up.

294
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,150
Don't wait!

295
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,110
Don't wait, Rekko!

296
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,900
We got- see, I am actually such a team player.

297
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,060
There we go.

298
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,140
There he is.

299
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,720
Bro, I am such a team- look at that!

300
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,020
This is how you appeal!

301
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,900
People don't fucking peel sometimes, and it pisses me off.

302
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,400
Oh.

303
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,100
People don't fucking peel in this yellow sometimes.

304
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,480
Okay, let me fix this real quick.

305
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,080
Oh!

306
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,160
I hate it when that happens.

307
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,420
What is it?

308
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:30,960
Nate.

309
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,420
Okay, let me...

310
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,760
Actually, let me check.

311
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,860
Where am I at?

312
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,240
Yeah, my CPU...

313
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,680
And my memory is all low, so I don't know why I'm lagging a little.

314
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,500
It's so annoying sometimes.

315
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,540
It really is.

316
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,500
Let's see.

317
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,340
I don't know why sometimes does it.

318
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,740
No, it's because we're not playing yet.

319
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,780
When we're playing, it starts doing it.

320
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,880
Round two.

321
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,460
Go!

322
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,980
Or maybe it's fixed.

323
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,720
I don't fucking know.

324
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,860
Let me see.

325
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,920
Alright.

326
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,220
Maybe it's better now.

327
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,020
Does that, maybe I has a memory leak.

328
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,200
Honestly, I might restart my game.

329
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,540
I've been playing for a very long time.

330
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,720
It's crazy right now.

331
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,520
Why does, that's always like, the snow, why does she stop?

332
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,100
Like, I've been, I've been like, waiting for a very long time.

333
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,700
I actually, I've never, I've never done any type of like, like weed or whatever.

334
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,400
I've never, it's actually, people, I, say that and people are like, are you sure?

335
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,080
It's like, I'm never.

336
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,040
Oh,

337
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,450
wait.

338
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,110
Oh, okay.

339
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,110
We have a star lord.

340
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,770
This fucking Hulk sucks.

341
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,890
Their Hulk is so bad.

342
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,430
I'm gonna say that and he's gonna beat the shit out of me.

343
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,650
Oh, shit.

344
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,930
He's gonna beat the shit out of me in the moment after I say that.

345
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,750
I have a feeling.

346
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,370
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

347
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,190
I'm safe in my little hidey hole.

348
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,550
Okay, I needed to give it to the starlet.

349
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,490
Okay, oh, it's fixed now.

350
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:20,870
Nice.

351
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:23,450
Oh, yeah.

352
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,510
Oh, never mind.

353
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,950
Oh, I thought that would...

354
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,790
Oh, I'm scared.

355
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,750
I talk shit and I don't want to get hit.

356
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,770
It's a legitimate... I think that's a legitimate fear.

357
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,250
You don't talk shit and you don't want to get hit.

358
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:40,290
Whoa.

359
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,770
I go here.

360
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,070
Oh, I don't want to go there.

361
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,350
Bro, get out!

362
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,590
Get out!

363
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,900
Oh, that's unlucky.

364
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,540
Can we even cap?

365
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,060
Nah.

366
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,740
Oh, I'm missing my friezes now.

367
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,200
I'm trying to fucking...

368
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,560
Oh, my God.

369
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,180
What is he doing?

370
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:11,900
He's...

371
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,580
You're crazy.

372
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,020
You're crazy.

376
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,480
It's fine, right?

377
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,540
I'm not living that.

378
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,060
I knew if I...

379
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,100
Oh, it doesn't matter.

380
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,520
I knew.

381
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,380
It didn't matter.

382
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,500
I didn't...

383
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,400
That's why I didn't ult that.

384
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,080
We would have died regardless if I ulted or not.

385
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,540
Oh my god, go rocket.

386
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,180
Go.

387
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,620
Go be the rocket you've always wanted to beat.

388
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,100
Come on.

389
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,260
Oh, that's unlucky.

390
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,600
I thought he was going to ult that when, you know, Bucky did the get down, but it's okay.

391
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,980
She's over here!

392
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,720
Get him!

393
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,780
Oh, she missed.

394
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,780
It's okay.

395
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,640
Sometimes you just miss.

396
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,420
It's okay.

397
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,380
Oh, I leave now.

398
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
I don't want...

399
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,100
Okay, there you go.

400
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,260
Oh, Star Lord, please don't...

401
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,140
Please don't die.

402
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,460
There we go.

403
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,760
Oh, I'm not lagging anymore.

404
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,260
Yay.

405
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,600
I fixed it.

406
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,600
I don't know what I did.

407
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,840
It just fixed itself, just like that.

408
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,680
I don't know what happened.

409
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,620
Hello.

410
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,660
I would like a little bit of heal.

411
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,660
It's, you know, it's ideal.

412
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,900
Just a little suggestion.

413
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,600
Really?

414
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,320
Like, I guess...

415
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:16,880
Oh!

416
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,800
I would like a little bit of heal right here too.

417
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,540
Oh, it would've been so cool if I hit that.

418
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If I hit that...

419
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,960
Oh my god!

420
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,840
Thank you!

421
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,100
Okay, I'm...

422
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,060
I'm okay with that.

423
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,100
Like, he actually got me closer to my team.

424
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,140
Like, that's actually quite ideal.

425
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,600
He, like, took me closer to my...

426
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:40,840
Oh!

427
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,240
Goodbye, Starlord.

428
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,300
Like, thank god- Oh!

429
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,180
Um, I hope Eels first, really.

430
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,160
Oh, we're even right now.

431
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,180
It's not too bad.

432
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,900
It's not too bad, we're even.

433
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,240
Oh!

434
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,160
Now we're up!

435
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,720
Alright, as long as we fight for two more minutes.

436
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,460
Should be five.

437
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,040
We don't question it exactly.

438
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,560
I almost have out two.

439
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,680
I am a...

440
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,820
Oh my god, that is a lot of us.

441
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,220
Guys, I think...

442
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,360
I think maybe we might have overdone...

443
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,760
Okay, that's fine.

444
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,780
We're all...

445
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,300
Whoa!

446
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,580
Who cares about alt management?

447
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,260
Am I right?

448
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,780
It's okay.

449
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,660
Our star lord.

450
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,900
Our star lord's gonna clutch this.

451
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,340
I believe it's okay.

452
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,760
Our star lord, our star lord.

453
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,960
It's gonna do so much Goodbye, oh my god.

454
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,120
We still alive.

455
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,220
Holy fuck.

456
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,760
Oh my god.

457
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,360
Oh, goodbye.

458
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,620
Oh goodbye.

459
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,740
It was it was a good show Good show good show good show It's true

460
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,960
All right, that's fine.

461
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,340
I'll just use my life first.

462
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,720
It's okay I know we had a little system going in.

463
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:17,420
Oh, wait.

464
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,860
Only I have a...

465
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,480
I don't know why.

466
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,140
I thought there's a reason.

467
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,000
I...

468
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,580
Are you serious?

469
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,960
Guys, why did no...

470
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
Guys, he was one!

471
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,120
Why did no one help me?

472
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,640
He was one!

473
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,860
Oh, my God.

474
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,220
This one!

475
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,800
Oh my god, we're so close!

476
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,120
Oh my god.

477
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,520
I think... I don't know if we can.

478
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,620
Oh wait, we can't.

479
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,360
He just might be dead though.

480
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,980
He is so dead.

481
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,660
He is so dead.

482
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,480
I have to die on card.

483
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,140
He is dead.

484
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,460
Oh!

485
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,500
I'm so sad.

486
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,260

491
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,340
It's fine.

It's fine.

495
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,580
It's fine.

You're so bad.

499
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,100
You're so bad.

500
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,600
You have Ava and you shot at the Starlord.

501
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,420
You...

502
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,200
Imagine having aimbutt and shooting at the guy.

503
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,460
Okay, never mind, he said.

504
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,740
Shooting at the guy with the snowflake.

505
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,000
You're so stupid.

506
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,960
You're so fucking stupid.

507
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,740
Like, holy shit.

00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,440
Oh, God.

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:26,940
Yeah.

511
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,440
It's okay.

512
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,120
One, four, three, two.

513
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,540
It's okay.

514
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,840

00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,540
I'm here.

523
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah, you can't make me sad.

524
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,160
I'm here because I am sad.

525
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,780
It's too late.

526
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,500
It's too late for me.

527
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,800
What the fuck are these people?

528
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,380
Who the fuck is Apollo?

529
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,980
Who is this guy?

530
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,100
Alright.

531
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,680
Wait, who was?

532
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,900
Was he in my team?

533
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,780
Who is this guy?

534
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,060
Oh, they were on the enemy team.

535
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,600
They fucked me up.

536
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,520
I was like, new friend?

537
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,880
Wait, I don't know who this guy is.

538
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,900
I've never heard of this guy before.

539
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,120
I mean, he's top 500 right now.

540
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,260
I could take him out of top 500.

541
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,800
Is that fucked up?

542
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,340
I could do.

543
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,080
I could take him out of top 500.

544
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,760
What the fuck, though, for V to say?

545
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,040
Is that...

546
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,300
Is that a little...

547
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,620
True.

548
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,480
If I can't get top 500, no one can.

549
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,420
He's...

550
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,480
Yeah, he's asking for it.

551
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,720
He can't.

552
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,280
I'll accept it.

553
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,260
If he invites me, I'll join.

554
00:37:16,460 --> 00:38:05,480
is that the way to start a friendship I see that you were your top 500 I guess I guess enjoy it before it's gone when you take yeah I see someone top 500 I play with them and then they lose top 500 and then i swapped those until i've and then if i bring everyone out of top 500 eventually it'll be low enough for me to get in yeah that's the strat guys that's the strat if i yeah if they if i can't have it they can't have it too true

555
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,300
No problem with this strat.

556
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,320
I don't even know who this guy is.

557
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,640
I see that they're top 500.

558
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,500
I accept.

559
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,900
Exactly.

560
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,200
I'm already sad.

561
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,780
I drag people down with me.

562
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,480
I don't understand why it's so high now.

563
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,720
I got a...

564
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,420

566
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
Like, okay, look at what...

567
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,560
Last season was not that high.

568
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,240
Last season...

569
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:54,660

572
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,650
In fact, I just want, I want it.

573
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,530

574
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,860

You know what would cheer me up?

576
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,160
You know what will exactly cheer me up right now?

577
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,060
Some good old-fashioned role play.

578
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,140
No one plays Venom anymore in the RP servers.

579
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,480
It makes me so sad.

580
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,180

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,400

584
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,020
This is a fucking maze.

585
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,100
Give me a sec.

586
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,200

587
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,100

Never mind.

608
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,940
I love these cues.

609
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,220
It's not harassment if they enjoyed it.

610
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,780
You saw her.

611
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,960
She gave me a slap in the ass.

612
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,100
I'm broken.

613
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:27,760
I am.

614
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,320
I'm a shell.

615
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,760
I'm a husk of person I once was.

616
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,480
Alright.

617
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,380

618
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,840

619
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,460

You heal me and then I heal you.

684
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:32,730
Oh.

685
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:35,390
Okay.

686
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:36,170
Um.

687
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,970
Oh, this is a little awkward.

688
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:40,670
Oh.

689
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,610
Yes, I have.

690
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:42,890
Whoa.

691
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,810
Hey, do you have bubbles?

692
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,430
Yes, you do.

693
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,490
And then Star Lord Ulx.

694
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,910
Wow, it's like, I predicted that perfectly.

695
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,530
I predicted that so perfectly.

696
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:00,690
Wow.

697
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,890
Guys, it's cool, guys.

698
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:07,470
We, it was not a full four minutes.

699
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,290
And that's all that matters.

700
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,110
Guys, as long as...

701
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,350
We should, we should surrender.

702
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,950
We should very much surrender.

703
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,930
Just like clockies.

704
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:19,730
The way you did, Urs.

705
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,970
This team is just...

706
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,350
We were cooked from the start.

707
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,070
It was just unfortunate.

708
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,770
This team was just...

709
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,490
Just a team diff.

710
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,030
That is this...

711
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,310
It is actually just a team dip.

712
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:52,850
Because, like, Starlo- Mantis- Mantis, Luna does not do enough heals at all.

713
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,450
Wait, is our Scythe-Log Zero?

714
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,170
You play Mantis?

715
00:49:58,830 --> 00:49:59,370
One of you?

716
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:01,750
Zero-five?

717
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:02,870
Oh, my God.

718
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,090
Oh, that's unfortunate.

719
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:07,530
Oh, my God.

720
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,510
Are we trying now?

721
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,130
Wow.

722
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,590
That's nice to know.

723
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,150
That's...

724
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,350
30 seconds before you attack.

725
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:17,190
Wow.

726
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,790
That's nice to know.

727
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,900
That's cool.

728
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,660
When can I play Envis?

729
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,220
Sucks.

730
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,840
I've actually been playing a lot of Envis for this season.

731
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,280
I've been avoiding Luna.

732
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,520
It's like...

733
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,340
I'm just tired of Luna.

734
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,120
The battle starts in five.

735
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,400
Four, three, two, Things will change, right?

736
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,800
It'll be different this time.

737
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,960
I believe...

738
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,060
I root.

739
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,780
Alright, let's see.

740
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,230
All I need to do is just...

741
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,450
Jesus, no one can heal you.

742
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,750
Not even God himself can save your life.

743
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:11,610
Oh my god.

744
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:12,780
It was so like...

745
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:13,670
Alright.

746
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,230
Eh, well, I didn't really need that bubble, but thanks for thinking about me, I guess.

747
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:25,110
I can't believe we didn't fucking ban Ultron.

748
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,930
Why did we ban all these other supports?

749
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:33,350
Like, but Ultron wasn't your first fake?

750
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,270
Oh my god.

751
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:42,270
Like, how can you ban so many supports, but yet you forget Ultron?

752
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,190
That's actually crazy.

753
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:48,630
We...

754
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,330
Ultron just sucks to play against.

755
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,930
I rather play against a Jeff than an Ultron.

756
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,930
Because, like, a good Ultron can be so oppressive.

757
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,230
So it's, like, not fun.

758
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,450
Um...

759
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:06,830
Yeah.

760
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:06,990
Oh.

761
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:11,750
Yeah.

762
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:12,950
Me too.

763
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,030
Okay.

764
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,210
These two shitty ass e-daters on my team.

765
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,210
You get your dog shit.

766
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,450
Yeah, for sure, man.

767
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,210
Oh, bro.

768
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,130
Oh, bro.

769
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,170
What if they live together?

770
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,370
You can't just assume.

771
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,090
What if they're...

772
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,110
What if they're...

773
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,790
Maybe they're not in it.

774
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,650
Can I assume that everybody's in it?

775
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,710
Yay!

776
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:59,390
And it could be like, it could live together.

777
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:10,130
Hey, I got you, buddy.

778
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,250
That's funny though.

779
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,690
That's crazy.

780
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:18,370
No!

781
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,970
Why are we winning now?

782
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:24,290
We...

783
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,350
No!

784
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,630
Oh,

785
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:35,990
they got it.

786
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:42,570
Goodbye.

787
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,150
Goodbye.

788
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,690
Why couldn't Armag do what he did?

789
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,610
Oh, I'm back.

790
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,950
Alright, it's cool.

791
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:55,090
No, don't.

792
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:55,690
No, stop.

793
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:56,590
Don't cap.

794
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:57,370
Stop.

795
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:58,510
No.

796
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,010
Wait, what the fuck is?

797
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,030
Okay, yeah, they are definitely not trying to cap.

798
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:02,950
No.

799
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:09,550
There we go.

800
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:10,410
No, stop.

801
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:10,830
Whoa.

802
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,410
No, stop, guys.

803
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,970
I was just trying to cap.

804
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,490
Everyone, stop!

805
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,890
Guys, come on!

806
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,010
Stop!

807
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:33,210
Stop!

808
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,010
Why is no one stealing the raccoon?

809
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,500
Oh, he's fucked.

810
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,260
Oh, this is where it ends, Ashley.

811
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,080
Oh, yeah, this is where it ends for me.

812
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,760
There's still hope.

813
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,820
Stop hoping.

814
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,880
I had no util for that.

815
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,460
Don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man!

816
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,280
Final score!

817
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,240
No, Amano isn't shit.

818
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,220
Amano is actually a good player.

819
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,200
He's apparently used to be on Hundred Thieves.

820
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,460
Like, this is all to count from what I'm told.

821
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,480
But he just... he left Hundred Thieves because he was...

822
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,200
I think his name is Billions or something?

823
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,260
And he left a Hundred Thieves because he just didn't want to play pro play anymore.

824
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,100
Which is understandable.

825
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,940
Um, who was the blade?

826
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,500
Oh, the e-daters?

827
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,760
There's a hundred thieves off.

828
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,860
Dude, didn't they win?

829
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,860
They weren't they champions?

830
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,060
No, they're currently good, apparently.

831
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,920
Um, what is it?

832
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,240
Alright, let's see.

833
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,840
Okay, yeah, I'm avoiding.

834
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:49,780
Yeah.

835
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,100
Yeah, no, I'm avoiding.

836
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,860
I saw that.

837
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,380
I was like, no, it's all out.

838
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:56,940
Get out.

839
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,620
I saw your peak.

840
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,940
Get out of my lobby.

841
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,160
No, no.

842
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,020
The games have been, I had so much hope at first from here.

843
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:08,640
Wait.

844
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:09,800
Here.

845
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,140
This was when I started having hope again.

846
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,500
And then, and then the game was like, no.

847
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,040
And then I was like, wait a minute.

848
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,460
Wait, I can bring this back.

849
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,240
I can bring this back.

850
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,720
And then this is when I, This is when I was like, okay, I quit.

851
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,590
I quit.

852
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:37,610
It's not reachable anymore.

853
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:38,850
It's not.

854
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,950
Apollo got off.

855
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,670
You got off?

856
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:49,410
Oh my, how am I supposed to bring anyone down to my level?

857
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,510
It's rough up there.

858
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,730
It ends in two days.

859
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:26,550
one day at 20 hours I can't believe it Adamie just deflects his top five see it's like it's so it's so much bigger than look at that like you could see his top five look at my tiny look at this stupid ass crest versus this top 500 crest look at how big the fucking top 500 crests compared to my tiny ass beta test shit Like,

860
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:35,010
that means you're, it looks so good!

861
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,650
I'm sorry, above average.

862
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,310
This is above average.

863
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,750
That's not fair.

864
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,130
Can't even make other people miserable.

865
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:50,670
Like, what's the point?

866
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,650
Why can't I just...

867
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,110
Why can't I just...

God.

878
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:08,950
It's okay.

879
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:11,510
Oh my God.

880
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:13,670
I...

881
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,570
Oh my God.

882
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,250
Thank God that guy.

883
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:16,850
I couldn't tab in fast enough.

884
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,390
I was trying to grab something real quick.

885
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:21,150
I'm banning ammo.

886
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:23,710
Oh.

887
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,650
Harbors, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

888
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,910
Thank you, thank you.

889
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:28,630
I really appreciate it.

890
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,750
I realized what was making me lag.

891
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:39,370
It's because when I tab out, when I tab out and I don't tab back in to VTube Studios, it lags.

892
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,590
Which is pretty stupid, but like whatever.

893
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,170
Like, whatever.

894
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,570
It does what it wants.

895
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:48,210
Hey, Ruben.

896
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:49,930
No, it's over.

897
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:51,430
I've accepted my fate.

898
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:53,390
I've accepted.

899
01:01:53,730 --> 01:02:19,710
can do now is just hoping that whenever I lose a game someone else is losing their top 500 that's that's the only thing that that's bringing me joy right now I'm hoping I'm hoping that whenever I lose someone else is also losing

900
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,770
That I fucked up there.

901
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,710
Top 500 securement.

902
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,450
That's what I'm hoping for.

903
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,670
And it...

904
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:36,130
That is the joy.

905
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:40,390
That is the one thing that's giving me so much joy right now.

906
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,010
Real.

907
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,990
Hey, Rigsie.

908
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:46,550
Alright.

909
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,990
This is my only thing that keeps me going.

910
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:53,710
Hoping that I fucked up.

911
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,330
I made their day.

912
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:55,930

913
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,570
Okay, I'm still playing the best I can.

914
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:10,850
Like, I'm playing, I'm still trying, but like, even when I try and lose, if I try and lose, at least like, knowing that I'm not the only one losing.

915
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,590
I swear to God, I'm also trying.

916
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,030

934
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:18,730
Like, I'm not getting a lot of all charge.

935
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,350
I'm just damage boosting my friends.

936
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:23,810
Oh, my God, you crazy.

937
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:25,250

939
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:26,350
He's dead.

940
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,770
He's so dead.

941
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:29,530
He's so dead.

942
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:32,330

01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:40,290
Where is he?

946
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:40,910
Where is he?

947
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:41,250
No!

948
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:42,290
I couldn't damage!

949
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:44,550
I couldn't give him the mega damage boost!

950
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:47,590
I can't do it.

951
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:48,370
No!

952
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:50,350
I threw that.

953
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,350
I tunnel vision him.

954
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,810
That's my bad.

955
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:57,790
everything.

956
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:01,510
Sorry, that was my bad tunnel vision that if I live we win that.

957
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,030
All right, focus up.

958
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,610
I haven't played Mantis in a bit.

959
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,370
So that is also my bad.

960
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:09,850
Don't brush me, don't brush me.

961
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,630
There we go.

962
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:13,710

01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:25,410
There we go.

965
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,590
Here we go, we did it.

966
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:30,950
Oh, so many.

Thank you for giving me tier one sub to Riggsian.

968
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:34,630
Ruben, thank you.

969
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:40,730
For Mantis, I have to actually focus up because I don't like I have to actually fucking aim.

970
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,080
I can't like fucking cruise.

971
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,540
I also haven't played Mantis.

972
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,580
I usually, oh my god, that's not my fault.

973
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,260
Oh, unlucky.

974
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:16,540

01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,660
I am pro-locked.

978
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:34,200
Run them over!

979
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,540
That's the only thing I had.

980
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,540
I knew they didn't have support ults for that, so.

981
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,140
I don't know if you're fucking stupid or something.

982
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,060
I don't fucking know.

983
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,200
I hope the other guys...

984
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,480

01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,440
Oh, Luna doesn't know it.

989
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,280

990
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,380
No, it mixed... Oh my god.

991
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,080
That was an accident.

I hate triple support.

996
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:33,820
It's so boring.

997
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,840
It actually is so boring.

998
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,340
It makes me so sad to play.

999
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,180
I don't know, it's just so boring to play in general.

1000
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,900
Okay, there you go.

1001
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,060

1046
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,270
Time to switch things up.

1047
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,010
Including which side draw.

1048
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:52,930
We're doing it.

1049
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:54,330
We're not...

1050
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:56,480
We're still doing it, but we're doing it.

1051
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:58,790
Yeah!

1052
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:05,830
Trying to keep damage boosted on me.

1053
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,130
Who's that guy?

1054
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:07,990
What if I come back in for heals?

1055
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:09,370
Cool.

1056
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:11,830
I could get a pick pretty easily.

1057
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,230
I will do that.

1058
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:14,890
They don't play enough at all.

1059
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:22,950
Understood.

1060
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:30,890
I'm communicating.

1061
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,050
I'm doing it.

1062
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:33,490
I'm being a team player.

1063
01:11:35,990 --> 01:12:08,390
NPC I might as well be an NPC I might as well I feel like an NPC this back and forth this fucking up back and forth with I feel like I should damage boost my phoenix but I'm like no ultran only bros gotta support's gotta stick together I feel like I'm not damage boosted by um I'm definitely not Not damage boosted by Phoenix at all.

1064
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:11,450
There you go.

1065
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,430
Get your stupid fucking damage boost, I guess.

1066
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,790
Support stick together!

1067
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,310
How dare they request for it?

1068
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:19,830
Uh, yeah.

1069
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:22,490
Oh my god.

1070
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:23,530
Is he okay?

1071
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:24,190
He's okay.

1072
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,150
He's so okay.

1073
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,890
He's so, he's so okay.

1074
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,170
Oh my gosh, please.

1075
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:34,970
I don't have, I don't have a lot of kills.

1076
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:39,090
Alright.

1077
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,070
There we go.

1078
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:45,470
There we go.

1079
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:46,450
You got damage boost.

1080
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:54,090
Jesus Christ.

1081
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:54,450
All right.

1082
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:55,910
Zzz.

1083
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:56,350
Zzz.

1084
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:04,490
There we go.

1085
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:08,070
That's also why I damage boost Ultron a lot because I want him to have all of it.

1086
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:09,130
Yeah.

1087
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,390
Yeah.

1088
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:12,170
Yeah.

1089
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:14,870
Get all that damage boost you want, baby.

1090
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:16,910
All right, here you go.

1091
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,910
I could heal him, but then that's not as fun.

1092
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,010
I'm gonna run out of them.

1093
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,030
Oh, shit!

1094
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:25,070
Oh, thank God.

1095
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:25,330
Okay.

1096
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,360
That's fine.

1097
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,260
All right, nice.

1098
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,760
I need these games.

1099
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,780
After that last game I had, I'd play...

1100
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:39,680
All right.

1101
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,160
I have one leaf.

1102
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,240
One whole leaf.

1103
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:45,260
I know he had.

1104
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,580
Oh, all right.

1105
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:48,040
Goodbye.

1106
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,120
Wait, what?

01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,360

01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,580
It's solo support time.

1205
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,260
It truly is pain.

1206
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,120
Oh, nice.

1207
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:08,040
All right.

1208
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:08,960
All right.

1209
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:09,980
Let's go.

1210
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:11,900
Let's go.

1211
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,180
Oh, yeah.

1212
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,760
Learn how to B-hop in this game.

1213
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:15,940
You know how to do it?

1214
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,480
Just buy.

1215
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,640
Oh, my God.

1216
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,160
A pro.

1217
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,780
I can't stop that.

1218
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:26,580
That's actually Crazy.

1219
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:28,640
Okay, maybe I can't.

1220
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:29,540
Yeah.

1221
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,220
Bro, I literally just...

1222
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,540
Um, what do I do?

1223
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:37,900
Okay, I come back.

1224
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:41,800
I'm like, I brought literally crossed the fucking Nile.

1225
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,720
Oh, my God.

1226
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,660
They have...

1227
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:46,640
They have fucking Widow.

1228
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,300
I, like, crossed the Nile for this person.

1229
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,540
And then he came back.

1230
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,980
Yeah, it's the same way to B-hop in.

1231
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:55,780
It's literally the same way.

1232
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:19,780

Will it?

1235
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,130
Oh, we're about to find out.

1236
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:12,150
Oh my god, our strange staggered so hard.

1237
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:13,230
Alright, good luck.

1238
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:14,530
You can have this shield.

1239
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:17,850
Okay, don't peek my shield.

1240
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:21,970
I won't use my shield as a shield, I guess.

1241
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:24,590
The shield is optional, apparently.

1242
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,290
Shield is optional.

1243
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:30,450
Oh, guys!

1244
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:31,350
Guys!

1245
01:26:31,470 --> 01:26:35,270
Guys, I-I-I cannot stop you at this point.

1246
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:39,610
Let's go.

1247
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,370
Get out.

1248
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,990
I thought we were about to- You know what?

1249
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:48,150
Fuck it.

1250
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:49,910
Here, here, here, here.

1251
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:50,470
Come on, come on.

1252
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,850
We're in- Okay, um, that's fine.

1253
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:54,410
That's fine.

1254
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:56,210
That's fine.

1255
01:26:58,850 --> 01:26:59,350
That's fine.

1256
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:00,230
That's fine.

1257
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:02,330
That's okay.

1258
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,250
Like, in our stream, just walks past my thing.

1259
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:09,090
That's okay.

1260
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:12,290
All right.

1261
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:14,590
Nope, she's doing the bad thing.

1262
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:16,290
Okay.

1263
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:19,650
Let's go.

1264
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:21,210
No, Loki fucking sucks.

1265
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:24,170
It's- he's such a bad character to play now.

1266
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:27,470
And so you're just like, whoa, Loki is so bad now.

1267
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:31,450
It's working for them because they actually have a DPS that's just carrying.

1268
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:31,890
them.

1269
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:35,470
They have a DPS that's carrying them right now.

1270
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:40,590
Like, I'm too scared to speak.

1271
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:41,370
Like, we have what...

1272
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:43,130
If we had Mag, it'd be different.

1273
01:27:43,210 --> 01:27:43,930
Like, look at what...

1274
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:45,510
Look at what our Strange is doing.

1275
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,490
Like, he's wasting...

1276
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:49,730
He's wasting shields.

1277
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:50,730
For some reason.

1278
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:51,590
I'm gonna ult them here.

1279
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:55,190
Like, I don't...

1280
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:57,690
Bro.

1281
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:58,990
Bro.

1282
01:27:59,410 --> 01:28:00,090
Oh, my God.

1283
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:00,690
No!

1284
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:01,950
I'm Strange!

1285
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:03,010
What?

1286
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:06,050
Our strange doesn't play our strange does not play tank.

1287
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:08,850
I Our strange doesn't play tank.

1288
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,070
There's no way.

1289
01:28:10,510 --> 01:28:11,410
There's no way

1290
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:17,750
What the fuck was that?

1291
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:24,970
Why are you playing you're our only?

1292
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:39,200
You're literally our only Oh my and he's very special guys oh my god okay that's fine

1293
01:28:43,130 --> 01:29:01,850
no i legitimately think this is not winnable it is not oh my god he was why was he flanking he was our he was our only front line

1294
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,220
Oh, but not enough.

1295
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,600
This is why I want to have a duo right now.

1296
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,640
So I have more of Void Slots, honestly.

1297
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:13,600
Oh.

1298
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,160
There's nothing.

1299
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:22,360
I winneth and I lose if they give if and take if wins away from me.

1300
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:26,340
No, like everyone thinks that was fucking...

1301
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,160
That was fucking weird.

1302
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:29,880
Not playing this.

1303
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:30,660
I'm playing Adam.

1304
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,420
Fuck this.

1305
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,280
It's not enough heals, but whatever.

1306
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,200
It's absolutely not enough heals, but whatever.

1307
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:45,280
If what I'm going to tank, I can play Invis or Cloak.

1308
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,740
Buddy, I ain't tanking.

1309
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,720
Oh, okay.

1310
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,400
Never mind.

1311
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:55,860
Alright, let's go.

1312
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:57,400
Why?

1313
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:57,940
No.

1314
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,260
Oh, I guess both works.

1315
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:05,870
Alright.

1316
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:38,750
that's okay we literally you know what will work if we actually if we just have a venom that's it venom or ultra that's it oh okay nothing can save you okay there you go nothing can save us this is the hell we created.

1317
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,510
Yeah, but we can easily...

1318
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:43,750
All we need is just...

1319
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:47,710
We just need, like, someone to...

1320
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:49,970
We need someone to dive, the widow.

1321
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:52,590
But we don't have anyone to dive.

1322
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,990
Because they have so...

1323
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:00,150
Their support lineup fucking sucks.

1324
01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:02,250
But we don't have enough damage.

1325
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:04,870
There we go.

1326
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:07,050
We don't have... There we go.

1327
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:09,010
We live, look at us.

1328
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,150
We're alive.

1329
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:11,650
You're welcome.

1330
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:14,510
We live a little longer.

1331
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:17,250
We just don't have enough...

1332
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,630
Okay, I'm fine with that.

1333
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:25,390
I'm back in the bag.

1334
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:28,230
He's still in the bag.

1335
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:33,590
We just don't have enough damage to like...

1336
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:38,710
We don't have enough damage output to kill them.

1337
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:41,150
Because literally they're all...

1338
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:44,710
I need to play this.

1339
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:47,110
They don't have a lot of heals.

1340
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:49,610
Loki's heals is so fucking garbage too.

1341
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:52,010
All right.

1342
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:54,490
All right.

1343
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:56,130
That's cool.

1344
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,750
That's cool too.

1345
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:04,850
Hello everybody.

1346
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:07,110
I'm not standing grouping up with you guys.

1347
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:11,410
Hello, guys.

1348
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:12,830
Wow.

1349
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:18,610
Unfortunate.

1350
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:19,670
It's okay.

1351
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:20,610
You know what?

1352
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:21,490
Good game.

1353
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:22,470
Good game.

1354
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:26,950
Good game.

1355
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:28,030
Let's just stand here.

1356
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:31,270
Look at that.

1357
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:32,710
Look, I brought them all in here.

1358
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:33,930
Look at that.

1359
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:36,930
Oh, I'm dead.

1360
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,970
I have no friends.

1361
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:44,350
I don't.

1362
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:48,030
It's a lonely world up here.

1363
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:50,810
No friends.

1364
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,790
Very lonely in this elo.

1365
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:59,670
Literally, we just need someone to play.

1366
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,490
Dive.

1367
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:03,450
No friends online right now.

1368
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:11,930
Nah.

1369
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:13,090
It's just unfortunate.

1370
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:14,290
You know what I'm gonna do?

1371
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:18,890
Oh wait, I- yeah, I gotta avoid this guy too, the X-Men guy.

1372
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:27,550
They- he gave it and take it away from me.

1373
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,530
Oh yeah, we got boy.

1374
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:30,970
What's his name?

1375
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:33,110
This guy.

1376
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,410
Also, oh my god.

1377
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,450
Why are you in my elo?

1378
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:40,010
Why are you here?

1379
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:44,490
Why are you here?

1380
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:46,510
Get out.

There we go.

1418
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:18,290
Everyone gets a turn.

1419
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:25,830
This is my favorite part about Marvel Rivals.

1420
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:32,410
Where's the food?

1421
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:33,710
It's Venom!

1422
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:35,070
Because he's a snack!

1423
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:40,510
I'm so tired.

1424
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:45,290
Oh my god, we have a...

1425
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:47,150
We have Spotty, man.

1426
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:51,050
Shut up.

1427
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:54,990
He's lunch, dinner, and dessert, exactly.

1428
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:03,010
I need to fix my sleep schedule, so I'm just pulling on a liner.

1429
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:07,490
I'm not going to stream all day, like, all, like, the whole night, or fucking morning.

1430
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:11,370
I'll do a YouTube stream later, too.

1431
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:13,230
I don't know what to stream on YouTube.

1432
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:14,810
Maybe Silk Song.

1433
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:16,550
I don't know.

1434
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:17,910
I'll think about it.

1435
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,730
Maybe I'll just do more Silk Song later today.

1436
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:55,850
Or maybe I just keep streaming rivals who knows I know it's like the last it's the last day Of Marvel rivals so a lot of people are still Desperate right oh my god clear Thank you for the red Thank you thank you I hope you had a great stream For those who don't know me my name is Doki Bray I am currently doom queuing right now Because I've lost all hope in life And I've accepted that I can't make it to top 500.

1437
01:38:56,330 --> 01:39:01,790
So I'm hoping that I will ruin other people's chances of making it to top 500

1438
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:26,350
But I'm still trying though, I'm still I'm still trying I'm just if I lose and they can't get top 500 Well, oopsie for them too bad for them, I guess After all these years 30 seconds before you attack That's the only thing that'll make me happy right now.

1439
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:30,070
Knowing that other people are failing too.

1440
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:33,770
Okay.

1441
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:37,630
It's alright.

1442
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:39,250
We're doing it.

1443
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:42,670
I'm playing my absolute hard out.

1444
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:45,850
Just if I lose, it's not my fault.

1445
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,670
Like, I'm trying so hard.

1446
01:39:51,250 --> 01:40:09,550
I'm so many thank you for that gifted thank you for gifting us up It's just unfortunate, you know if we lose and they don't secure top 500 because now they know how I feel when I couldn't fucking secure top 500 despite trying so hard

1447
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:15,550
Jesus Christ what the fuck is he okay?

01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:08,430
How are we struck?

1453
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:09,010
Oh my god.

1454
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:15,210

1458
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:58,670
I think maybe...

1459
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:01,950

1460
01:42:01,950 --> 01:42:03,110
Guys, I might derank.

1461
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:06,090
I might actually derank.

1462
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:12,890
There might be a chance that I might derank.

1463
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:13,850
Goodbye.

1464
01:42:15,110 --> 01:42:15,270
Goodbye.

1465
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:18,650
It's the only way for me.

1466
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:19,870
my team to win.

1467
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:25,170
Oh my god.

1468
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:26,470
Like, I'm...

1469
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:27,070

Get over here.

1471
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:28,270
Get over here.

1472
01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:29,630
Get over here.

1473
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:31,490
Get over here.

1474
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:32,670
Walk into this.

1475
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:34,230
Walk forward.

1476
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:38,010
Oh, that's bad.

1477
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:39,250
That sucks for me.

1478
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:41,230
He was smart.

1479
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,700
He was smart.

1480
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,780
He used the invas to fucking all through.

1481
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:53,020
Uh, no.

1482
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,580
Y'all, they have the better players.

1483
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:58,840
Oh, and then our...

1484
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,220
They just have the better players.

1485
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:05,220
It just truly is just one of those times.

1486
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,840
They just, unfortunately, have better players than...

1487
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:09,700
It's just a team diff.

1488
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,560
There's, like, nothing we can do.

1489
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,440
At least we...

1490
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,920
Hey, we pushed it so far, though.

1491
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,080
Okay, there you go.

1492
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:23,720
Oh.

1493
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:25,920
Oh, I got the shield.

1494
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:27,260
Let's go.

1495
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,820
Let's be through the shield.

1496
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,880
Oh, that's fine.

1497
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:34,200
I got you.

1498
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:36,640
Oh, that's not fine.

1499
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,480
Where is the hell?

1500
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:38,980
Okay.

1501
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,340
There we go.

1502
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:46,300
Okay, it might be... Oh, never mind.

1503
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,220
There we go.

1504
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:50,960
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1505
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,820
But I have to be here.

1506
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:14,880
I'm sorry I have to use this for it please I have to use it for this guy I'm sorry I don't know where he is where did he come from oh he flew up he flew up

1507
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:51,920
yeah it's ring Celestial 3 which is one rank below top 500 but there is a chance that i might derank there's a very close possibility um that i might derank out of celestia i did sleep and it's well i woke up at 5 30 p.m and that's why i'm resetting my sleep schedule

1508
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:00,220
What the fuck is going on in my chat right now?

1509
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:03,960
Yeah, there's no hope of climbing.

1510
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:08,460
But I'm here as long as other people...

1511
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:13,020
As long as other people are also losing hope, that makes me...

1512
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:14,140
That brings me joy.

1513
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:19,700
I'm hoping I could drag someone that is top 500 right now and take them out of time.

1514
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,460
That's my only wish.

1515
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,560
I don't want much in life.

1516
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:34,380
But with that, I would like very much.

1517
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,500
I am an ELO terrorist today.

1518
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:39,040
I'm still playing, I'm trying.

1519
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:42,300
It's just, there's no luck by my side.

1520
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,580
There's no luck on my side right now.

1521
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:48,880
Four, three, two, one.

1522
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,220
I have become a government agent.

1523
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:55,040
That's fine.

1524
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,310
It's just an...

1525
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,720
Bro, okay, it's fine.

1526
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:02,600
It's fine.

1527
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:07,280
I don't know how they live, but okay, it's working.

1528
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,140
It's working, possibly.

1529
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:13,080
Oh, never mind.

1530
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:14,500
He's opening a portal.

1531
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,360
He's opening a portal.

1532
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:19,100
Oh.

1533
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:21,200
Oh.

1534
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:21,980
Oh.

1535
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:22,980
Oh.

1536
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:23,120
Oh.

1537
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:23,200
Oh.

1538
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:23,720
Oh.

1539
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:23,960
Oh.

1540
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:24,000
What?

1541
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:25,800
Oh!

1542
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:27,460
Hey, everyone.

1543
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:30,700
Are we all having a grand old time?

1544
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,300
Oh, goodbye.

1545
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:34,260
Not for him, no.

1546
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:35,360
It's okay.

1547
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:37,180
I have one res.

1548
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,420
One goodbye.

1549
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,620
I have zero res.

1550
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,120
It's okay.

1551
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,020
I have now have zero res.

1552
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:54,920
How do we not built anything out of that?

1553
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:58,520
Oh, let's hope he lives.

1554
01:46:59,660 --> 01:46:59,880
Hello.

1555
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,520
Can you kill one venom?

1556
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:04,160
Oh my god, he lives.

1557
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:06,420
He lives.

1558
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:07,660
Oh.

1559
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:11,100
Okay.

1560
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,540
That's fine.

1561
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,240
Oh, wait.

1562
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:23,180
I want to rock it for you.

1563
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,440
I'm rocket man for you.

1564
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,820
What the fuck?

1565
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:30,020
I went rockin' man, though.

1566
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:33,560
Maybe?

1567
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:34,780
I don't fucking know.

1568
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:36,880
This is, like, the dumbest fucking...

1569
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:38,420
You know what?

1570
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:38,960
Fuck it.

1571
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,040
Yep.

1572
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,100
Okay, that was actually smart.

1573
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,520
Okay, now it's gone.

1574
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:56,240
Okay.

1575
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,060
Stop my machine.

1576
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,100
machine gun going.

1577
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:02,180
Oh, there you go.

1578
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,080
It worked.

1579
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,100
I love false hope.

1580
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:12,960
I love...

1581
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,180
They just need to do one good all and we're fucked.

1582
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:20,580
We're just fucked with one good all that's over.

1583
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:22,520
It's so over.

1584
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:25,580
There's no way they see this, right?

1585
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,140
Oh, yeah, no, they do.

1586
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:28,960
They absolutely

1587
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,300
It's fine.

1588
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:34,780
It's fine.

1589
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:37,460
We we have Luna all at least.

1590
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:39,960
Luna died first so she should have her out now.

1591
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:40,520
Yeah

1592
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,540
That's very unfortunate.

1593
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:51,300
Hey, but at least we have Luna all right There was oh my god, that's funny.

1594
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:59,060
She's fucking stupid Oh my god, okay, hey um Alright.

1595
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:02,320
Hello.

1596
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:04,760
Hello.

1597
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:06,100
I tried.

1598
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,400
I tried.

1599
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,200
There are Luna and I have what?

1600
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:12,380
Oh, she did not.

1601
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:15,080
There was no hope.

1602
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:17,900
He just slowly walking over.

1603
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:19,500
It's never been...

1604
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,540
Oh, hey, there's a portal.

1605
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:21,680
That's fine.

1606
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:23,940
I knew it was over here.

1607
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:25,840
I didn't even realize there was a portal.

1608
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,520
I didn't know there was a portal!

1609
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:38,740
What the fuck?

1610
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,660
I went back!

1611
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:43,880
I touched the point for us.

1612
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:45,860
I went to touch the point.

1613
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,040
Like, what do you...

1614
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:53,100
What do I do?

1615
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,260
Nobody told me that we were portaling.

1616
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,640
I literally was like...

1617
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,760
I'm the only one that didn't die.

1618
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:02,740
How is that my fault?

1619
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:10,560
I didn't even realize we were portaling.

1620
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:13,680
There were three of us up front.

1621
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,580
And I was like, why aren't we touching the point?

1622
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,200
All right, I touched the point.

1623
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,140
Oh, no, I gave up.

1624
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:24,360
It's fine.

1625
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,400
He'll just avoid me.

1626
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:28,960
I fucked up.

1627
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:30,800
Like, I fucked up that entire game.

1628
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,260
I was not the problem.

1629
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:36,600
Oh, I made one mistake not knowing we were poorling.

1630
01:50:36,860 --> 01:50:39,300
Because nobody was communicating.

1631
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:44,980
Like, I...

1632
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,540
No one was communicating.

1633
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:51,620
I was like, well, guess I have to touch the point now.

1634
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,540
But, oh.

1635
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:58,060
Because I didn't...

1636
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,240
die and I was up front.

1637
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:07,910
Finding someone, finding everything.

1638
01:51:08,990 --> 01:51:10,350
Like just one mistake.

1639
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:13,630
Just because zero people talked.

1640
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:20,630
And like, okay, wait.

1641
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:21,610
Let's see.

1642
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:26,370
Let's see here.

1643
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:28,870
How the fuck did I have more?

1644
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:29,350
Okay.

1645
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:31,570
I'm not, I won't question it.

1646
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:34,190
I will question it.

1647
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:37,150
I'm like, how the fuck do I have more damage?

1648
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:40,110
I was rocked for an entire round.

1649
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:46,170
I was rocked for an entire fucking round.

1650
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:49,210
But, oh, I'm the problem.

1651
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:52,010
I have more heals.

1652
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:53,190
No, it's because I was Invis.

1653
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:55,010
Invis, you get more heals in general.

1654
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:57,550
Yeah.

1655
01:51:58,810 --> 01:51:59,930
That's crazy.

1656
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:03,710
or so, whenever you're ready, Yixie.

1657
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:04,550
Are you on?

1658
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:05,010
Alright.

1659
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:06,910
Alright.

1660
01:52:15,290 --> 01:52:16,670
Wait, what rank are you right now?

1661
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:22,710
We're all in the trenches.

1662
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:24,350
No, where she's not carrying.

1663
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:26,370
Did she just saw what I saw, guys?

1664
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:29,030
Did you not just see what I saw?

1665
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:32,450
He's not carrying shit.

1666
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:36,030
We're both gonna be suffering today.

1667
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:44,030
We live in a society.

1668
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:48,510
At least I'm doing win-loss, win-loss.

1669
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:50,630
Also, yeah, you can do EUQ if you want.

1670
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:51,370
I don't really care.

1671
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,290
It doesn't really matter to me.

1672
01:52:56,610 --> 01:52:57,210
Don't worry.

1673
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:59,990
I got some cash on hand.

1674
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:03,710
Don't worry.

1675
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:05,630
Will anyone want him?

1676
01:53:05,790 --> 01:53:06,110
Hello.

1677
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:08,090
Would you like to dance for me?

1678
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:13,110
have dance emote.

1679
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:14,610
Whoa!

1680
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:17,050
Give me a heal.

1681
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:22,210
Does she have dance emote?

1682
01:53:22,970 --> 01:53:23,310
Hello.

1683
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:25,570
Do you have dance emote?

1684
01:53:26,950 --> 01:53:28,550
Where's my dance emote?

1685
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:30,770
Oh, there we go.

1686
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:37,770
There we go.

1687
01:53:38,330 --> 01:53:39,710
Mama likes.

1688
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:42,850
Yes!

1689
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:44,170
Dance!

1690
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:45,570
Oh my god!

1691
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:46,270
Bleak!

1692
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:51,630
Yeah, okay, I need heals.

1693
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:53,390
This chip is gonna kill me.

1694
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:56,390
I'm gonna grab some heals real quick.

1695
01:53:57,370 --> 01:53:58,250
And then...

1696
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:58,510
Hello.

1697
01:53:59,430 --> 01:53:59,790
Alright.

1698
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:01,350
Let's go back.

1699
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:03,650
Let's go back to the real content.

1700
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:07,210
I brought coins to the club.

1701
01:54:08,730 --> 01:54:09,710
That's right.

1702
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:11,130
Wait, it should be here.

1703
01:54:11,290 --> 01:54:11,770
Yeah!

1704
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:14,810
That's right!

1705
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:15,610
Whoa!

1706
01:54:16,490 --> 01:54:18,170
It's not allowed!

1707
01:54:19,330 --> 01:54:21,370
Black Panther was like, no.

1708
01:54:25,950 --> 01:54:29,270
Not in my PG Christian server.

1709
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:32,190
That was the pouncy.

1710
01:54:34,630 --> 01:54:36,310
I didn't even touch it!

1711
01:54:36,850 --> 01:54:38,710
I just, there's some coins!

1712
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,870
That's not even touching!

1713
01:54:42,910 --> 01:54:44,170
Bro, no.

1714
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:46,590
I didn't even touch!

1715
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:49,650
He's like no fun.

1716
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:51,290
Oh, is it this guy?

1717
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:52,890
Get him out of here!

1718
01:54:54,570 --> 01:54:56,290
Get this guy out of here!

1719
01:54:58,230 --> 01:55:00,590
He shouldn't be here in this lobby.

1720
01:55:02,490 --> 01:55:05,370
I was respecting the dancers!

1721
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:07,690
Hello.

1722
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:09,230
Hello, ma'am.

1723
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:11,070
Hello.

1724
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:13,270
There we go.

1725
01:55:15,210 --> 01:55:16,170
There we go.

1726
01:55:16,530 --> 01:55:17,970
She knows what...

1727
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:19,050
She does!

1728
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:22,310
She sees me and then she just starts dancing.

1729
01:55:22,930 --> 01:55:25,930
I'm respectfully throwing the cash.

1730
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:30,230
The fact that she instantly was like, Oh, yep.

1731
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:32,830
I know what you want.

1732
01:55:36,870 --> 01:55:38,630
She was ready.

1733
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:41,470
I told her to do what.

1734
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:42,390
I just asked her to do.

1735
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:43,970
Do you have the dance emote?

1736
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:46,990
And every time she sees me, she knew.

1737
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:49,950
She understood.

1738
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:52,090
What, Chiro, do you think you want to be today?

1739
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,200
That's a good dancer.

1740
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:00,700
She wants that bag.

1741
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:02,640
She knew I was carrying that bag.

1742
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,460
She saw it.

1743
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:08,420
Who am I going to banish from this match?

1744
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:11,520
She a smart one.

1745
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:13,400
She's a hard worker.

1746
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:20,760
She works very hard.

1747
01:56:27,670 --> 01:56:29,850
Look, she could have not danced.

1748
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:31,510
It was her choice.

1749
01:56:32,050 --> 01:56:33,270
And then she could have stopped.

1750
01:56:33,430 --> 01:56:36,030
She didn't have to keep dancing when she saw me.

1751
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:38,490
But she still kept dancing.

1752
01:56:38,830 --> 01:56:39,630
So who's...

1753
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:40,750
It's not my fault.

1754
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:42,450
I'm just giving her what she wanted.

1755
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:47,130
He's just trying to make it through college.

1756
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:54,830
And I'm helping her.

1757
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:57,390
I'm helping her get her degree.

1758
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:58,030
Chat.

1759
01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:01,650
I'm so kind and generous.

1760
01:57:03,610 --> 01:57:04,010
Mm-hmm.

1761
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:07,130
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

1762
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:07,510
Yeah.

1763
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:11,190
It's very selfish of me if I don't give her money.

1764
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:16,110
I'll consider it.

1765
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:16,790
I know.

1766
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:19,850

1771
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:11,670
Oh yeah, when you are, you can do like very fast pehopping because of the momentum from her own.

1772
01:58:11,890 --> 01:58:17,330
So you can be like and like hop backwards and everything.

1773
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:19,750
It's pretty neat.

1774
01:58:20,050 --> 01:58:20,790
Not gonna lie.

1775
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:22,950
Fucking neat.

1776
01:58:24,730 --> 01:58:25,970
And I'll give him damage boost.

1777
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:28,150
Oh, that's nice.

1778
01:58:28,370 --> 01:58:28,870
That's good.

1779
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:34,380
Oh, that was so close.

1780
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,200
Whoa!

1781
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:37,520
Shit!

1782
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:39,380
Oh my god, I almost got out.

1783
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,340
I almost got out.

1784
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,880
I did not think I was gonna get hooked.

1785
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:44,320
That's unlucky.

1786
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,680
Oh my, that's so unlucky that got hooked there.

1787
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,320
There we go.

1788
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:00,320
Oh, nice.

1789
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:01,720

1791
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:09,310
That Hulk got lost.

1792
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:13,710
Oh, my God.

1793
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:14,270
Oh, my God.

1794
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:15,270
Our Emma got lost.

1795
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:17,410
Where's my star, Lord?

1796
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:20,870
Where the fuck is my star, Lord?

1797
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:24,790
Oh, that's unlucky.

1798
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:27,410
Oh, he died.

1799
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:28,790
That's what happened to him.

1800
01:59:30,890 --> 01:59:31,410
Okay.

01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:34,230
Okay, let's go.

01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:36,070
Okay, let's not go.

1803
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:39,410
Let's not go anymore.

1804
01:59:42,930 --> 01:59:44,910
It's damage boost!

1805
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:46,050
Okay.

1806
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:52,830
There we go.

1807
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:53,970
Let's go.

1808
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:56,390
I love it when I drive.

1809
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:59,770
When I do the Mantis drive by.

1810
02:00:07,410 --> 02:00:08,010

1811
02:00:08,010 --> 02:00:08,610

1824
02:00:58,710 --> 02:00:59,590

02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:09,710

02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:10,450
He wants to grab me.

1827
02:01:10,670 --> 02:01:11,610
He wants to grab me.

1828
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:12,150
I'm scared.

1829
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:17,650

02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:40,890
He's gonna... Nope!

1840
02:01:41,470 --> 02:01:42,510
Didn't exile me!

1841
02:01:46,050 --> 02:01:46,690
Alright.

02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:54,550
Okay, I need...

1845
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:54,710
Okay.

1846
02:01:54,730 --> 02:01:57,210
Oh, they're running double-triple support now.

1847
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:57,710
They know.

1848
02:01:58,330 --> 02:01:59,950
They know it's our crutch.

1849
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:02,630
They know.

1850
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:06,630
They know we need this.

1851
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:09,050
We need this so bad.

1852
02:02:13,330 --> 02:02:14,470
Oh, he has all doesn't he?

1853
02:02:14,990 --> 02:02:16,370
Um, it's okay.

1854
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:17,910
It's not okay anymore.

1855
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:20,970
It's not okay anymore.

1856
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:23,290
They know.

1857
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:24,990
They know.

1858
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:29,230
We're on our triple support crutch.

1859
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:31,170
How did they know?

1860
02:02:32,610 --> 02:02:34,250
It's like, yeah, I'm going in with my ult.

1861
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:36,010
I don't understand.

1862
02:02:36,390 --> 02:02:37,490
How did they know?

1863
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:39,430
Oh, my God.

1864
02:02:40,930 --> 02:02:41,370
Stupid.

1865
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:44,230
That's fine.

1866
02:02:46,930 --> 02:02:47,670
Oh, my God.

1867
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:48,270
He's so low.

1868
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:50,030
Let's do this.

1869
02:02:50,250 --> 02:02:50,570
Oh, wait.

1870
02:02:50,590 --> 02:02:51,070
We can't.

1871
02:02:51,090 --> 02:02:51,910
We can't do it, JK.

1872
02:02:52,290 --> 02:02:54,150
Let's do this when our tanks are here.

1873
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:54,850
All right.

1874
02:02:55,050 --> 02:02:56,270
Let's do this.

1875
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:00,890
This is the bunny hop that I was talking about.

1876
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:05,430
Okay.

1877
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:09,150
Jesus Christ.

1878
02:03:11,770 --> 02:03:12,710
Oh yeah, no, he's dead.

1879
02:03:14,030 --> 02:03:14,890
No, he's still dead.

1880
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:19,730
Oh my god, it's over.

1881
02:03:19,830 --> 02:03:20,990
They're going triple support.

1882
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:22,310
They know.

1883
02:03:23,070 --> 02:03:24,290
We have the word.

1884
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:26,210
The thing is...

1885
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:28,910
Please, please, please shoot this.

1886
02:03:29,190 --> 02:03:30,110
Oh, thank God.

1887
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:34,050
I'm trying.

1888
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:36,770
You just know.

1889
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:43,620
There you go.

1890
02:03:47,730 --> 02:03:48,090
Oh my God.

1891
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:51,390
Oh my God.

1892
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:51,990
Oh my God.

1893
02:03:52,290 --> 02:03:52,390
I gotta leave.

1894
02:03:53,410 --> 02:03:54,270
I gotta leave.

1895
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:56,110
Oh, no!

1896
02:03:56,370 --> 02:03:57,070
I got...

1897
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:57,530
Oh, nice.

1898
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:58,090
Hello.

1899
02:03:59,110 --> 02:03:59,530
Hello.

1900
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:00,090
Hello.

1901
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:09,430
There you go.

1902
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:10,530
Don't I got you!

1903
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:12,750
Got you!

1904
02:04:14,730 --> 02:04:15,490
Nice.

1905
02:04:16,270 --> 02:04:16,950
We did it.

1906
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:19,370
We did it.

1907
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:21,430
I told you I got her.

1908
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:22,950
I told you!

1909
02:04:23,670 --> 02:04:25,270
I told you!

1910
02:04:28,090 --> 02:04:30,790
I told you I got it.

1911
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:33,410
The right heroes could make all the difference.

1912
02:04:36,330 --> 02:04:38,210
I'm just saying I'm just here.

1913
02:04:39,410 --> 02:04:39,850
I'm just here.

1914
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:41,070
I just see red.

1915
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:43,610
Just like the real mantis.

1916
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:54,170
I just go.

1917
02:04:54,590 --> 02:04:55,190
I just see.

1918
02:04:55,490 --> 02:04:56,530
I just want to shoot.

1919
02:04:57,350 --> 02:04:58,530
I just go bam, bam.

1920
02:04:59,190 --> 02:04:59,530
Whop, whop.

1921
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:06,790
Yeah, you see the button hop or the momentum after you're up?

1922
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:07,290
You just go.

1923
02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:11,590
But you just find scroll wheel down for a jump.

1924
02:05:13,010 --> 02:05:13,750
That's it.

1925
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:17,250
That's how you go so fast.

1926
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,630
You can do it backwards too.

1927
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:19,970
You can do this with all...

1928
02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:22,930
Yeah, it's literally just like Apex.

1929
02:05:23,370 --> 02:05:23,970
You just go...

1930
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:26,770
And that's really it.

1931
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:30,450
It makes you go so fast.

1932
02:05:30,610 --> 02:05:31,970
That's why I like...

1933
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:34,210
That's why I run so fast.

1934
02:05:36,730 --> 02:05:37,650

1935
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:38,450

02:07:43,650 --> 02:07:45,770
Why isn't anybody walking?

1954
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:51,890
That is a good question.

1955
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:55,630

Don't worry.

1999
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:35,160
I got you.

2000
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:36,460
Ladies and gentlemen.

02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:47,300
Look at him in the corner.

2010
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:47,760
Look at him in the corner.

2011
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:50,840
There you go.

2012
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:52,800
We used everything.

2013
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:54,440
Okay, we did not.

2014
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:55,760
I don't know why we used everything.

2015
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:57,360
I was like, I got this.

2016
02:10:58,740 --> 02:10:59,460
They're done.

2017
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:02,760
Alright, it's fine.

2018
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:04,520
Nice.

2019
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,720
It's okay.

2020
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:11,180
I got you all the leaves you want, baby.

2021
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,860
Okay, goodbye.

2022
02:11:17,020 --> 02:11:21,060
She did not die.

2023
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:22,360
I was lied to.

2024
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:26,100
I was lied to and then I also got shot.

2025
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:26,900
I got slapped.

2026
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:28,320
Oh my god, thank you.

2027
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:32,920
Oh my god.

2028
02:11:33,220 --> 02:11:34,680
My tanks are so dead.

2029
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:37,560
You know what?

2030
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,680
I'll die here.

2031
02:11:40,540 --> 02:11:40,920
I farm.

2032
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:41,900
Oh shit!

2033
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:42,880
No!

2034
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:45,040
Oh, get me out of here.

2035
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:46,840
Get me out of here!

2036
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:47,820
Get me out!

2037
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:48,600
Get me out!

2038
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:51,500
I did not expect myself to be there.

2039
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:54,340
Do we have anything?

2040
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:55,540
At all?

2041
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:00,540
Okay.

2042
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,960
Don't worry, I got you.

2043
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:11,400
Here we go.

2044
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:16,680
Oh no, not boring again.

2045
02:12:26,530 --> 02:12:27,370
Wait, are we?

2046
02:12:27,690 --> 02:12:28,230
Is this winnable?

2047
02:12:28,470 --> 02:12:29,390
I don't think it's winnable.

2048
02:12:30,110 --> 02:12:30,790
It's not winnable.

2049
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:34,550
It was definitely not winnable.

2050
02:12:35,610 --> 02:12:36,910
Wait, I had to tab out real quick.

2051
02:12:37,490 --> 02:12:38,330
Alright, there you go.

2052
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:39,630
It's fine.

2053
02:12:39,970 --> 02:12:40,830
It's fine.

2054
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:43,590
I still have my...

2055
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:45,290
Wait, what?

2056
02:12:45,370 --> 02:12:45,650
Why?

2057
02:12:45,690 --> 02:12:46,010
Groot?

2058
02:12:46,650 --> 02:12:47,530
Groot, why?

2059
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:50,550
It's fine.

2060
02:12:57,770 --> 02:12:58,950
Oh, shit.

2061
02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:00,230
Okay, we don't have to all of this.

2062
02:13:01,230 --> 02:13:02,590
Oh, yeah, we don't have to.

2063
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:02,970
Oh.

2064
02:13:05,130 --> 02:13:07,430
Yeah, I was gonna say, we definitely don't have to use anything.

2065
02:13:11,230 --> 02:13:12,190
Okay, it's fine.

2066
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:16,620
Double!

2067
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:17,860
Alright.

2068
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:19,360
Never surrender!

2069
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:21,820
Okay, okay.

2070
02:13:23,700 --> 02:13:24,220
He...

2071
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:26,080
I'm a little worried about her.

2072
02:13:26,580 --> 02:13:27,620
But that's okay.

2073
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:30,840
It's fine.

2074
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:31,620
We'll do this.

2075
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:34,400

No, it's rank.

2095
02:15:16,610 --> 02:15:21,690
It's crazy to say that this is the second highest form of ELO.

2096
02:15:22,670 --> 02:15:24,970
Because it's right below top 500, I think.

2097
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:26,270
That's the saddest part.

2098
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:29,830
This is...

2099
02:15:31,870 --> 02:15:34,850
It is literally right below type 500.

2100
02:15:37,850 --> 02:15:39,950
It's like top a thousand, I think.

2101
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:45,440
Yeah.

2102
02:15:48,900 --> 02:15:49,900
54 assists?

2103
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:51,460
I mean, we all got a lot.

2104
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:53,320
Look, see, 42, 46.

2105
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:54,840
We all contributed.

2106
02:15:56,860 --> 02:15:58,180
Yeah, I made five.

2107
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:00,360
No, I made six people drop you, though.

2108
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,220
That's the best part.

2109
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:03,440
Wait, let's see.

2110
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:04,500
Let's see if anyone do rank.

2111
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:34,280
today we should avoid this person okay what about you what about you let's see oh you're not you're not securing top 500 my friend You ain't securing shit.

2112
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:35,840
I'm not.

2113
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:38,140
This guy's trying to secure it right now.

2114
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:42,100
You ain't securing top 500 today.

2115
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:49,600
Alright.

2116
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:51,140
I'm at you.

2117
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,880
Oh, he's just been screaming.

2118
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:55,420
Look at this nerd.

2119
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:56,820
Alright.

2120
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:01,210
Nice.

2121
02:17:01,650 --> 02:17:03,230
We're all here to suffer.

2122
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:54,110

2123
02:18:08,510 --> 02:18:09,370
See, I did it.

2124
02:18:09,450 --> 02:18:10,530
Peace established.

2125
02:18:11,310 --> 02:18:12,450
I did it, guys.

2126
02:18:12,670 --> 02:18:14,390
I brought world peace.

2127
02:18:16,590 --> 02:18:18,070
I did it, everyone.

2128
02:18:19,170 --> 02:18:20,590
I solved it.

2129
02:18:21,150 --> 02:18:23,710
This dance, the power of dance.

2130
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:27,970
Dancers in the background of old fighting games.

2131
02:18:28,610 --> 02:18:28,730
Yeah.

2132
02:18:29,730 --> 02:18:32,370
I deserve a Nobel Peace Prize.

2133
02:18:33,570 --> 02:18:35,170
They stopped dancing the moment.

2134
02:18:35,790 --> 02:18:37,110
But they're about to be removed.

2135
02:18:37,190 --> 02:18:37,810
I was like, what?

2136
02:18:38,510 --> 02:18:39,410
I just got in.

2137
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:42,210
Now I'm about to be removed from the game.

2138
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:44,390
I don't understand.

2139
02:18:50,330 --> 02:18:51,350
We have a penny.

2140
02:18:51,810 --> 02:18:52,670
We have...

2141
02:18:53,290 --> 02:18:55,730
So we have no front line.

2142
02:18:56,210 --> 02:18:57,270
I got it.

2143
02:18:58,490 --> 02:19:00,250
They give us and take us.

2144
02:19:02,530 --> 02:19:06,250
I'm about to be removed for being a goddamn free.

2145
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:06,710
Sorry, guys.

2146
02:19:06,830 --> 02:19:08,130
I'm an invisible woman.

2147
02:19:08,670 --> 02:19:09,050
Sure.

2148
02:19:09,310 --> 02:19:09,990
Or Angela.

2149
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:12,710
Thank you very much.

2150
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:14,510
That's fine.

2151
02:19:14,930 --> 02:19:16,530
Oh shit, this is EU.

2152
02:19:17,370 --> 02:19:18,690
Fuck, okay.

2153
02:19:19,170 --> 02:19:23,550
But very much, very, very much.

2154
02:19:23,790 --> 02:19:25,850
Okay, we're in EU lobbies right now.

2155
02:19:26,650 --> 02:19:28,650
I did say I'm okay with EU lobbies.

2156
02:19:29,970 --> 02:19:31,850
I did say that, I know.

2157
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:32,810
What about Emma?

2158
02:19:35,550 --> 02:19:37,850
They already banned Torch, so it's fine.

2159
02:19:38,690 --> 02:19:40,430
Really nothing we have to worry about.

2160
02:19:43,310 --> 02:20:05,010
um what we're gonna run triple support guess with luna um oh i guess guys all right let's try all right let's see if i can do mantis with 160 ping i've never done it before so it's gonna be a fun time

2161
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:16,360
come on come on do something Pick a support.

2162
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:19,360
Come on.

2163
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:22,980
Do something.

2164
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:25,280
Do you want to play Mantis?

2165
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:31,020
Come on.

2166
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:32,940
Come on.

2167
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:35,960
All right, I don't fucking care.

2168
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:39,840
All right.

2169
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:42,820
What the fuck?

2170
02:20:46,860 --> 02:21:16,520

2171
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:21,640
Yeah, personally, I think one doom is way more than enough.

2172
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:23,720
Where are we?

2173
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:24,840
Oh.

2174
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:32,950
Yeah, I think I'm going to be the one that can't hit shit.

2175
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:40,770
Oh, my God.

2176
02:21:41,090 --> 02:21:41,710
This is hell.

2177
02:21:41,930 --> 02:21:43,850
Okay, I'm going to go Jeff.

2178
02:21:44,490 --> 02:21:45,070
Actually, I can't.

2179
02:21:45,310 --> 02:21:47,810
Fuck, I can't even go Jeff because...

2180
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:48,190
Oh, my God.

2181
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:48,830
This is hard dive.

2182
02:21:51,310 --> 02:22:02,910
Oh my god, ring around the rosy Ashes, ashes, ashes, we all fall down

2183
02:22:06,670 --> 02:22:23,190
Oh my god, oh this is hell No, we got rid of Invis too Holy fuck, okay I have to play cloak, I cannot I can't play Mantis against that.

2184
02:22:24,570 --> 02:22:26,250
That's too much.

2185
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:28,690
That's actually too much.

2186
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:36,010
There's a slight Lipsy, you think?

2187
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:37,110
No, there isn't.

2188
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:39,470
Okay.

2189
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:41,890
Oh, no, Rigsie.

2190
02:22:43,930 --> 02:23:03,910
Alright, the fact that we got rid of Envis lets them a fucking strong-ass dive so that's like the only issue dive is very very scary right now

2191
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:11,690
all right

2192
02:23:15,070 --> 02:23:24,030
good luck to us good luck holy fuck

2193
02:23:27,370 --> 02:23:28,330
Oh my god.

2194
02:23:28,970 --> 02:23:29,850
Oh my god.

2195
02:23:29,890 --> 02:23:31,490
I don't know how I got here.

2196
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:33,310
But hello everyone.

2197
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:36,690
Hello.

2198
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:42,850
Okay, there we go.

2199
02:23:43,710 --> 02:23:44,550
I...

2200
02:23:45,790 --> 02:23:48,490
That was stressful.

2201
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:51,110
That was very stressful.

2202
02:23:51,950 --> 02:23:55,610
That was incredibly stressful.

2203
02:23:57,370 --> 02:23:58,850
I got to make another beacon.

2204
02:24:00,410 --> 02:24:00,780
I...

2205
02:24:02,230 --> 02:24:04,270
That was not fun.

2206
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:06,590
That was not fun.

2207
02:24:06,730 --> 02:24:08,010
Guys, I don't think we're winning this.

2208
02:24:08,450 --> 02:24:10,350
I legitimately don't think so.

2209
02:24:10,730 --> 02:24:13,710
Because of how unfun that is.

2210
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:17,570
Oh, shit.

2211
02:24:21,250 --> 02:24:21,990
Okay.

2212
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:27,080
Oh, we're dead.

2213
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:29,260
I'm dead.

2214
02:24:29,320 --> 02:25:02,920
sorry let me be more specific i'm dead okay at least a good thing is that um is that we're running triple support we're running zero support we're oh shit he took it he took the heels he took the heels that i needed okay how adam bro okay Okay, how Adam got zero kills?

2215
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:04,000
This is hell.

2216
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:09,280
It is absolute hell to play against.

2217
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:11,840
It actually is.

2218
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:13,740
Oh my god.

2219
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:18,240
It's like your new cat.

2220
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:19,780
There's nothing.

2221
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:26,520
It's actually absolute hell to play against this.

2222
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:32,180
That's how.

2223
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:39,370
Oh my god, I'm trying.

2224
02:25:39,890 --> 02:25:41,130
Don't worry, Rigsie.

2225
02:25:41,230 --> 02:25:43,490
I am absolutely trying.

2226
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:44,910
You're right now.

2227
02:25:48,390 --> 02:25:50,370
Do you not see what we're going through?

2228
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:52,330
Okay.

2229
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:56,570
The whole team is diving.

2230
02:25:56,830 --> 02:25:57,330
Exactly.

2231
02:25:58,650 --> 02:25:58,950
Okay.

2232
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:01,030
I am hoping...

2233
02:26:03,650 --> 02:26:04,290
Okay.

2234
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:12,660
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

2235
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:21,640
I hope that our Adam plays for Rez.

2236
02:26:22,460 --> 02:26:29,480
Because it will be a very unfortunate if our Adam does not...

2237
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,660
Oh, thank God.

2238
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:31,020
Okay.

2239
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:33,100
Alright, Adam's dead.

2240
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:45,360
Oh my god.

2241
02:26:45,740 --> 02:26:47,700
Oh my god, please tell me.

2242
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:53,820
Can you just tell me there's a...

2243
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:58,420
Oh my god, I'm still here!

2244
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:09,280
Control lost, but our jeff has spirit.

2245
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:14,120
No, this is absolute hell.

2246
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:16,300
There's like four divers.

2247
02:27:23,840 --> 02:28:20,440
what was that adam res he did not play for res i don't know how he doesn't know how to play for res i i don't understand i really all he has to do is no we need that penny that penny was clutch like three people were just running at us i should have went to the rocket but to be fair we were like super split up there that was uh like we should not split up but like we were like not okay the support backline was so fucked up because we don't have an invisible to push the thing is we bad invisible women for the angela and because we bad the invisible women we don't have like a good dive counter got it so we did it for her and it fucked us over

2248
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:50,260
yeah no he should have swapped off a long time ago oh i mean running to i mean they're running to to as well and so the only issue is that okay i need him i'm just gonna i'm gonna be here i'm gonna be here i'm the mines are my safe place i shall i shall live in the mines

2249
02:28:57,230 --> 02:29:00,130
Like, if I see them diving, this is where I'll live.

2250
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:03,030
Like, they don't have frontline, but they're so...

2251
02:29:03,030 --> 02:29:04,250
Like, we don't have peel.

2252
02:29:04,590 --> 02:29:05,370
Yeah, that's the thing.

2253
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,690
It's just...

2254
02:29:06,690 --> 02:29:08,670
They don't have frontline, we don't have peel.

2255
02:29:09,530 --> 02:29:10,690
It's just unfortunate.

2256
02:29:12,230 --> 02:29:13,710
It's just the best of...

2257
02:29:14,250 --> 02:29:15,910
The worst of both worlds.

2258
02:29:18,610 --> 02:29:19,490
Jesus Christ.

2259
02:29:21,630 --> 02:29:22,830
Wait, what happened to the mines?

2260
02:29:28,630 --> 02:29:55,330
Please tell me I can't risk No I don't Mr. Broken Bond Thank you for the Five Gifts and Sows Thank you Thank you I didn't even know I didn't know He was back there But I'm coming over That's so unfortunate I was getting like Shot in the back And what can the rocket do Absolutely Are you serious?

2261
02:29:56,290 --> 02:29:57,310
Oh my...

2262
02:29:57,310 --> 02:29:58,870
Like, where do I go?

2263
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:02,310
Can't

2264
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,180
go anywhere!

2265
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:08,180
I can't!

2266
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:12,160
Okay.

2267
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:14,760
Literally nothing I could do.

2268
02:30:16,180 --> 02:30:19,540
I was just trying to heal our penny as much as I can.

2269
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:21,560
My time to shine.

2270
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:24,680
Oh my, that's smart.

2271
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:26,900
That's so smart, though.

2272
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,520
I mean, I can go in with my love.

2273
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:30,860
I gotta wait for our penny.

2274
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:32,900
Oh, never mind.

2275
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:34,140
We don't go in with the other.

2276
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:35,680
Are you serious?

2277
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:37,040
Are you serious?

2278
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:38,020
Oh my god.

2279
02:30:38,140 --> 02:30:38,780
Okay, it's fine.

2280
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:40,440
It's fine.

2281
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:41,120
It's fine.

2282
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:42,320
It's fine.

2283
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:43,480
Are we still...

2284
02:30:43,480 --> 02:30:44,200
Are we still in it?

2285
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:46,500
We're still in it.

2286
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:49,720
We're not in it anymore.

2287
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:52,560
We're not in it.

2288
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:56,840
It's just...

2289
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:58,700
This is just hell.

2290
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:00,300
I don't know what to do.

2291
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:01,040
It's just hell.

2292
02:31:05,220 --> 02:31:06,400
It's just hell.

2293
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:08,160
Like, what do we do?

2294
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:13,480
Alright.

2295
02:31:16,060 --> 02:31:18,120
I think we have to play.

2296
02:31:18,940 --> 02:31:20,160
We have to play, Jeff.

2297
02:31:20,380 --> 02:31:22,120
There's nothing I can do.

2298
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:26,040
Like, I'm literally just getting touched.

2299
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:27,940
I don't like it.

2300
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:33,020
My name's Jeff

2301
02:31:37,070 --> 02:31:43,930
The stuff we do Oh my god Oh my god please Oh

2302
02:31:47,110 --> 02:31:58,490
I forgot they have panther I forgot they have panther Oh my god that's like my only counter That's actually so that sucks I legitimately Oh

2303
02:32:03,390 --> 02:32:05,050
That's literally my counter.

2304
02:32:05,630 --> 02:32:07,390
I forgot they have Jeff.

2305
02:32:10,390 --> 02:32:10,950
Because...

2306
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:11,270
I'm not Jeff.

2307
02:32:11,470 --> 02:32:12,450
I forgot they have a Panther.

2308
02:32:13,610 --> 02:32:14,870
Panther counters, Jeff.

2309
02:32:18,370 --> 02:32:19,650
Jesus Christ.

2310
02:32:21,830 --> 02:32:22,950
That's unlucky.

2311
02:32:23,310 --> 02:32:25,170
They were just hard countering us.

2312
02:32:28,750 --> 02:32:31,610
I can't live as Cloak because there's just...

2313
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:35,550
as Luna because three people were running at me.

2314
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:44,420
It's because we banned invisible women for Angela.

2315
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:50,320
If we didn't ban Invis, this wouldn't have been so hard.

2316
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:52,980
That's our only problem.

2317
02:32:53,660 --> 02:32:55,820
We banned invisible women.

2318
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:01,260
Invis would have saved us because Invis is a good dive counter.

2319
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:02,540
We've got Invis.

2320
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:26,420
Like I could just up here what the fuck how did it get here what the fuck why did it instantly put me in doom i didn't click anything how did i get here oh my god it's a ghost how the fuck did i get here

2321
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:37,020
i sent got sent back to the homeland oh i didn't have it god damn Oh, it's because Rigsie sent me here.

2322
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:42,660
Oh, there's a duo.

2323
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:44,260
Oh, my God.

2324
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:45,180
Everybody's fighting.

2325
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:45,900
I didn't want to play.

2326
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:49,940
I thought I had to watch the sensory deprivation chamber.

2327
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:50,940
Whoa.

2328
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:52,160
Hey, I'm peaceful.

2329
02:33:53,020 --> 02:33:55,120
Why are Europeans not peaceful?

2330
02:33:59,060 --> 02:33:59,660
What?

2331
02:34:00,540 --> 02:34:02,380
In the NA lobbies.

2332
02:34:02,740 --> 02:34:04,180
Everyone was so nice.

2333
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:17,560

Is this...

2346
02:35:45,430 --> 02:35:46,250
No, this is NA.

2347
02:35:46,850 --> 02:35:47,930
No, this is EU.

2348
02:35:48,090 --> 02:35:48,530
Never mind.

2349
02:35:48,670 --> 02:35:50,530
I don't know why I saw Chinese characters.

2350
02:35:50,710 --> 02:35:51,970
I'm like, I'm an NA.

2351
02:35:52,330 --> 02:35:53,150
I don't know!

2352
02:35:53,410 --> 02:35:55,790
I was just like, I'm like, what are you doing here in Europe?

2353
02:35:57,930 --> 02:35:58,730
Another Angela?

2354
02:36:00,770 --> 02:36:03,990
Now, who am I gonna banish from this match?

2355
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:10,850

We made it to GM.

2361
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:15,400
If we lose this.

2362
02:38:15,720 --> 02:38:16,820
If we lose this.

2363
02:38:17,400 --> 02:38:17,840
We're running out.

2364
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:20,460
Oh my god, we have no front line.

2365
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:23,900
We have the perfect support cop.

2366
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:26,500
I think you're probably going.

2367
02:38:28,860 --> 02:38:30,320
I'll fucking bubble you in shit.

2368
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:31,920
Oh yeah.

2369
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:33,220
You're trying to take it.

2370
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:33,920
No more, no more, no more.

2371
02:38:34,180 --> 02:38:34,640
Speak your ass.

2372
02:38:34,900 --> 02:38:35,520
Whatever you did.

2373
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:36,530
You're huge.

2374
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:41,360
This is hell.

2375
02:38:41,820 --> 02:38:43,080
This is actually hell.

2376
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:43,730
This is...

2377
02:38:45,700 --> 02:38:46,140
Bro!

2378
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:48,100
There isn't no more!

2379
02:38:49,160 --> 02:38:50,480
This is hell!

2380
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:51,720
No bubble.

2381
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:54,640
You need to chase them.

2382
02:38:55,100 --> 02:38:56,680
Oh my god.

2383
02:38:57,420 --> 02:38:59,740
This is hell to heal.

2384
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:00,280
How about Adam?

2385
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:02,640
Okay, it's fine.

2386
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:04,120
It's not fine.

2387
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:26,660
i'm gonna die no front line is actually so it's so hard it's actually so hard uh not having a front line i can we can touch for a bit what the happened i need to go touch and then i can come on i'm back

2388
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:38,080
Wait, what happened to the Jeff?

2389
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:40,960
Okay.

2390
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:42,560
Oh.

2391
02:39:43,100 --> 02:39:44,320
One field, one field, one field.

2392
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:47,640
I don't think he's one HP anymore.

2393
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:50,720
Oh my god.

2394
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:56,120
The no front line is very, very high.

2395
02:39:56,860 --> 02:40:00,380
Oh my god, I might die.

2396
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,560
Oh my god, please shadow.

2397
02:40:03,360 --> 02:40:03,580
Whoa!

2398
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:05,560
Get me out of here.

2399
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:06,680
Give me up.

2400
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:07,660
Do we have front line now?

2401
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:08,680
Do we have front line?

2402
02:40:08,980 --> 02:40:09,940
Oh, thank God.

2403
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:12,080
Oh, thank God.

2404
02:40:12,280 --> 02:40:12,400
Okay.

2405
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:13,100
No, we don't.

2406
02:40:13,180 --> 02:40:14,560
We still do not have front line.

2407
02:40:15,100 --> 02:40:17,880
This is so hard though.

2408
02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:22,300
Like, it's fine if it's attacked, but we're in defense right now.

2409
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:25,060
So this is a very scary.

2410
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:35,060
This is very...

2411
02:40:40,600 --> 02:40:41,440
Jesus Christ.

2412
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:47,900
I guess I dropped down too.

2413
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:49,180
I'm stalling him so I can't fight.

2414
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:51,760
Oh, how now.

2415
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:55,040
Oh my god, I can't do it.

2416
02:40:55,060 --> 02:41:09,880
anything oh my god it's fine it's fine it's fine i come back i couldn't press q oh my god

2417
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:15,120
that's unlucky

2418
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:22,600
oh that's unlucky three more times i think it's gonna work

2419
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:29,840
I think she has remote control over the key.

2420
02:41:33,800 --> 02:41:37,180
Oh, I would love to have like a shield, you know?

2421
02:41:37,940 --> 02:41:39,060
That would be cool.

2422
02:41:44,060 --> 02:41:44,700
Okay.

2423
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:50,660
I'm here to save.

2424
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:53,000
I'm here to save.

2425
02:41:53,180 --> 02:41:53,860
Don't worry.

2426
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:56,480
I'm a...

2427
02:41:57,060 --> 02:41:59,040
I'm no longer a hero.

2428
02:42:03,860 --> 02:42:05,600
I'm no longer a hero.

2429
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:06,580
Don't worry.

2430
02:42:06,980 --> 02:42:09,640
I'm no longer... I'm fucking play...

2431
02:42:09,640 --> 02:42:11,680
I'm not playing Luna into this.

2432
02:42:11,860 --> 02:42:12,740
This is...

2433
02:42:12,740 --> 02:42:14,420
This is too hard.

2434
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:20,060
This is too hard to play Luna into this cap.

2435
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:25,040
This guy's... GM is looking mighty and...

2436
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:29,260
It's just mighty tempting right now.

2437
02:42:33,020 --> 02:42:38,200
GM sure is looking at...

2438
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:39,340
Oh gosh.

2439
02:42:42,040 --> 02:42:44,040
I can't do anything.

2440
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:46,820
Oh.

2441
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:50,180
There's just no front line.

2442
02:42:50,580 --> 02:42:53,080
I can't play Luna into this.

2443
02:42:55,060 --> 02:43:00,980
I'm just gonna play I freeze them, but it doesn't matter Pick those to play here.

2444
02:43:01,020 --> 02:43:01,860
I'll be honest

2445
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Like I we have oh man That's unlucky like legitimately it's just the fact that We have the DPS line The DPS line the tank the support line We just we just don't have the one thing that matters the most the tank line

2446
02:43:42,490 --> 02:43:47,110
you know what can bubble that mag

2447
02:43:51,090 --> 02:44:03,830
a mag can bubble that i have a when you're gonna shuffle so i can like actually try to bubble it you wouldn't see me again Oh my god, the mag would, I just think we just don't have.

2448
02:44:06,610 --> 02:44:08,870
All right, here we go.

2449
02:44:09,190 --> 02:44:09,410
All right.

2450
02:44:10,130 --> 02:44:11,130
No more close, no more close.

2451
02:44:11,230 --> 02:44:11,470
He's beating.

2452
02:44:12,750 --> 02:44:13,570
You need to chase him.

2453
02:44:13,890 --> 02:44:15,850
I guess next.

2454
02:44:16,270 --> 02:44:16,810
One of you, one of you.

2455
02:44:17,570 --> 02:44:18,530
They're down through, they're down.

2456
02:44:21,670 --> 02:44:22,530
Start over here.

2457
02:44:22,890 --> 02:44:23,410
Start over here.

2458
02:44:23,690 --> 02:44:24,210
Oh my god.

2459
02:44:24,490 --> 02:44:25,830
This is, okay.

2460
02:44:26,390 --> 02:44:27,930
No more, no more, no more.

2461
02:44:27,930 --> 02:44:31,810
I have to use that to stabilize too.

2462
02:44:32,370 --> 02:44:33,930
That's the worst part.

2463
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:40,980
Jesus.

2464
02:44:48,460 --> 02:44:50,840
Oh my god.

2465
02:44:52,200 --> 02:44:54,540
Get me out of this hell.

2466
02:44:56,620 --> 02:44:57,900
I tried.

2467
02:45:08,470 --> 02:45:10,710
Yeah, no, this is a doom queue.

2468
02:45:12,130 --> 02:45:13,670
True, you cool out that you do that.

2469
02:45:14,970 --> 02:45:19,090
The current score is 0, 2, 3.

2470
02:45:20,210 --> 02:45:25,050
All I'm going to say, they are trying so hard.

2471
02:45:25,990 --> 02:45:29,690
I mean, this is a perfect cop for attack.

2472
02:45:31,310 --> 02:45:33,870
But this is a terrible cop.

2473
02:45:34,310 --> 02:45:40,430
know that you're gonna hold that this is a terrible cop for defense there's no way

2474
02:45:44,580 --> 02:46:08,100
there's no fucking way what did i do wrong excuse me i froze the captain four times for us oh sorry maybe i should have frozen every time they dive us bro what the is wrong you should not you don't deserve the name you You don't deserve this twilight name.

2475
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:10,660
You actually don't deserve it.

2476
02:46:10,860 --> 02:46:13,180
30 seconds before the attack.

2477
02:46:13,560 --> 02:46:14,620
Jeff, do you have a microphone?

2478
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:18,780
No,

2479
02:46:22,340 --> 02:46:25,740
the thing is, he is a support player blaming me.

2480
02:46:26,280 --> 02:46:32,100
Even though, yeah, I didn't queue that one fight because I didn't think we would need it.

2481
02:46:36,620 --> 02:46:38,680
Yeah, because it was just me and him.

2482
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:41,720
Why the fuck would I sew the wall for us too?

2483
02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:45,560
When you could, you know, fucking just peel.

2484
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:49,560
That's fine.

2485
02:46:50,400 --> 02:46:51,100
It's fine.

2486
02:46:51,380 --> 02:46:55,680
He's playing because he won't stop 500, and I'm denying that from him, and I'm fine with that.

2487
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:01,440
I'm fine denying that.

2488
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:02,060
I'm fine denying that.

2489
02:47:05,570 --> 02:47:06,510
I'm fine.

2490
02:47:08,870 --> 02:47:10,990
You probably like fucking kill me.

2491
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:14,710
That's five.

2492
02:47:15,090 --> 02:47:16,390
No, I can't play it again.

2493
02:47:17,950 --> 02:47:20,230
I don't think any one of us can play it again.

2494
02:47:20,690 --> 02:47:21,230
I'm gonna die.

2495
02:47:21,390 --> 02:47:22,190
I'm not gonna spend the rest.

2496
02:47:26,610 --> 02:47:27,730
Jesus, guys.

2497
02:47:28,150 --> 02:47:32,150
I feel like if we just go name more, then maybe it'll work.

2498
02:47:33,730 --> 02:47:34,310
Look, I'm belong.

2499
02:47:34,650 --> 02:47:35,830
What's the fucking DPS of white?

2500
02:47:39,830 --> 02:47:41,810
Nice, walk, walk, walk, I'm going, I'm going.

2501
02:47:41,890 --> 02:47:42,110
All right.

2502
02:47:42,610 --> 02:47:44,130
We walk, I guess.

2503
02:47:44,650 --> 02:47:45,610
I mean, fucking, nice.

2504
02:47:46,090 --> 02:47:47,090
Go, Lord.

2505
02:47:48,050 --> 02:47:48,430
Walk one.

2506
02:47:48,750 --> 02:47:50,030
Walk literally one, hold literally one.

2507
02:47:50,670 --> 02:47:51,270
Hold literally one.

2508
02:47:51,970 --> 02:47:52,390
All right.

2509
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:55,470
I wish we could get him for you, bro.

2510
02:47:55,670 --> 02:47:56,150
I don't have both.

2511
02:47:56,250 --> 02:47:56,630
I don't have both.

2512
02:47:57,310 --> 02:48:00,350
What am I doing?

2513
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:08,680
Oh, my.

2514
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:08,920
Oh, my.

2515
02:48:11,860 --> 02:48:12,720
What the fuck?

2516
02:48:12,820 --> 02:48:13,640
Where is that whale?

2517
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:15,660
Clear the way.

2518
02:48:16,580 --> 02:48:17,400
Alright.

2519
02:48:19,080 --> 02:48:20,520
There we go.

2520
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:23,000
Goodbye.

2521
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:27,320
It's okay.

2522
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:34,540
Then I can feel the joy of ranking it back to Celestia.

2523
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:36,020
It's okay.

2524
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:42,380
At least I can feel the joy, you know, of coming back to Celestia.

2525
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:48,240
It's okay.

2526
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:50,960
For like 30 seconds.

2527
02:48:52,200 --> 02:48:53,380
You know.

2528
02:48:53,940 --> 02:48:55,460
Everyone look up.

2529
02:48:55,580 --> 02:48:56,920
Everyone look up.

2530
02:48:57,440 --> 02:48:58,120
No cooldowns.

2531
02:48:58,200 --> 02:49:00,360
No cooldowns.

2532
02:49:00,360 --> 02:49:02,820
Bro, please.

2533
02:49:03,220 --> 02:49:05,660
If we do not kill him after that.

2534
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:08,040
Go this guy.

2535
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:10,920
This guy really wants to win.

2536
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:12,400
He doesn't know.

2537
02:49:14,260 --> 02:49:15,900
He doesn't know.

2538
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:17,840
Oh, man.

2539
02:49:19,820 --> 02:49:21,120
Wait, why?

2540
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:24,540
What the fuck is that?

2541
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:27,740
He went like...

2542
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:30,200
Holy shit, where did I go?

2543
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:33,260
No, I might be.

2544
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:34,780
I might be a bastard.

2545
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,000
I might be a bastard for that.

2546
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:37,360
What happened?

2547
02:49:38,900 --> 02:49:40,720
Did he jump off the map?

2548
02:49:41,060 --> 02:49:41,700
Oh, man.

2549
02:49:42,820 --> 02:49:55,120
Oh, guys, I just don't think I think it's just over no i think this entire team was just

2550
02:50:01,310 --> 02:50:03,670

2552
02:50:21,370 --> 02:50:25,910
That is the highest form of copium I've ever had.

2553
02:50:26,150 --> 02:50:28,770
That appeared cop at this point.

2554
02:50:30,690 --> 02:50:32,270
It doesn't have a hat to do that.

2555
02:50:33,310 --> 02:50:35,850
He will cope right now.

2556
02:50:41,270 --> 02:50:44,830
No, no, no, no, no.

2557
02:50:44,830 --> 02:50:45,970
I beg, please.

2558
02:50:51,050 --> 02:50:51,990
It's over.

2559
02:50:54,070 --> 02:50:55,030
It's over.

2560
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:57,670
It's over.

2561
02:50:58,150 --> 02:50:58,790
It's over.

2562
02:50:58,790 --> 02:51:00,590
This is pure passion.

2563
02:51:01,290 --> 02:51:03,330
Actual passion right now.

2564
02:51:04,650 --> 02:51:06,430
Holy shit, that's some good ass tracking.

2565
02:51:06,670 --> 02:51:07,530
Jump up, jump up, jump up.

2566
02:51:07,530 --> 02:51:08,430
I don't get up so easily.

2567

What the fuck?

2570
02:51:54,790 --> 02:51:55,990
How do I win these games?

2571
02:51:56,610 --> 02:51:58,290
He's crashing out!

2572
02:51:59,010 --> 02:52:00,090
Holy shit!

2573
02:52:00,570 --> 02:52:03,350
Oh my god, he's crashing out.

2574
02:52:03,930 --> 02:52:04,990
Oh my god.

2575
02:52:09,580 --> 02:52:11,760
Guys, I don't think he's happy.

2576
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:15,220
I don't think he's happy.

2577
02:52:18,740 --> 02:52:19,580
Wait, he's...

2578
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:20,520

I think...

2580
02:52:24,260 --> 02:52:26,420
He's actually crashing out.

2581
02:52:29,140 --> 02:52:30,240
That was me.

2582
02:52:30,480 --> 02:52:31,820
That was me before my stream.

2583
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:33,300
Well, it wasn't...

2584
02:52:34,380 --> 02:52:37,600
I don't even... Oh my god, we already been... Oh my god, it's been three hours?

2585
02:52:38,060 --> 02:52:39,940
This does not feel like three hours.

2586
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:41,480
Holy shit.

2587
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:44,060
I didn't... This does not feel like three hours.

2588
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:51,800
I told you.

2589
02:52:51,960 --> 02:52:54,520
I told you it was your doom queue out.

2590
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:56,440
I don't know what else to do.

2591
02:52:56,520 --> 02:52:58,080
Oh my god.

2592
02:52:58,940 --> 02:53:00,440
These games are cursed for.

2593
02:53:00,600 --> 02:53:01,700
He's not okay.

2594
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:05,080
It does not feel like three days or three hours.

2595
02:53:05,460 --> 02:53:06,620
I'm having a good time.

2596
02:53:07,940 --> 02:53:11,620
I don't know about my duo partner, but I'm having a good time.

2597
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:12,940
I don't know what to play.

2598
02:53:14,460 --> 02:53:14,480
Why?

2599
02:53:14,900 --> 02:53:16,480
Actually, I do know what to play.

2600
02:53:21,530 --> 02:53:23,670
This is the life of the Doomers.

2601
02:53:25,290 --> 02:53:26,130
Yeah, just wish.

2602
02:53:27,030 --> 02:53:28,150
Hey guys.

2603
02:53:30,230 --> 02:53:32,610
I felt like I have an impact.

2604
02:53:33,170 --> 02:53:35,910
But I don't know what to do.

2605
02:53:36,410 --> 02:53:38,590
To make a difference.

2606
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:40,290
Wait, come on.

2607
02:53:40,510 --> 02:53:41,670
Oh, hey, you want to...

2608
02:53:41,670 --> 02:53:42,170
Hey, Jeff.

2609
02:53:43,230 --> 02:53:43,670
Whoa!

2610
02:53:44,310 --> 02:53:44,690

2611
02:53:45,310 --> 02:53:46,030

2612
02:53:46,390 --> 02:53:48,450
That's right, you freak.

2613
02:53:49,050 --> 02:53:50,010
That's right.

2614
02:53:50,430 --> 02:53:53,110
Eat ass, skate fast.

2615
02:53:54,450 --> 02:53:56,310
And the Thor was like, fast!

2616
02:53:56,390 --> 02:53:58,330
That's right!

2617
02:53:59,970 --> 02:53:59,990
Yeah!

2618
02:54:05,770 --> 02:54:12,620
The Thor was like...

2619
02:54:13,050 --> 02:54:14,750
The Thor was like...

2620
02:54:14,750 --> 02:54:15,150
No!

2621
02:54:15,970 --> 02:54:16,870
Bad dog!

2622
02:54:21,010 --> 02:54:21,610
Bad dog!

2623
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:23,710
Because you don't have infinite fucking healing there.

2624
02:54:24,170 --> 02:54:25,530

He's my bouncer.

2628
02:54:57,090 --> 02:54:57,350
Hey there.

2629
02:54:57,610 --> 02:54:58,170
Bro, bro.

2630
02:54:58,650 --> 02:54:58,770
Hey.

2631
02:55:00,850 --> 02:55:02,250
I need my bouncer.

2632
02:55:03,010 --> 02:55:08,490
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

2633
02:55:09,250 --> 02:55:10,550
Pop, pop, pop.

2634
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:17,650
Maybe it... Okay, if I find Orixie's the only Celestial 2 now.

2635
02:55:19,050 --> 02:55:20,370
Maybe the games would be easier.

2636
02:55:21,830 --> 02:55:23,730
Do you think you would be today?

2637
02:55:24,830 --> 02:55:25,770
Maybe the game...

2638
02:55:25,770 --> 02:55:25,970
Oh!

2639
02:55:32,090 --> 02:55:34,390
Maybe go back to NA.

2640
02:55:34,850 --> 02:55:36,230
I think the EU games are...

2641
02:55:36,230 --> 02:55:37,910
I think the EU games...

2642
02:55:37,910 --> 02:55:42,630
I think EU games are more cursed than NA right now.

2643
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:45,870
Maybe we should go back to NA.

2644
02:55:46,210 --> 02:55:51,810
I think the worst games I...

2645
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:54,230

2646
02:55:58,610 --> 02:56:07,030

I won't play this.

2652
02:56:59,310 --> 02:56:59,830
I won't play it.

2653
02:57:00,490 --> 02:57:01,210
Oh, fuck.

2654
02:57:01,330 --> 02:57:02,990
I should play Nuna for the Black Panther.

2655
02:57:05,050 --> 02:57:08,890
Do not fall for the Elo assassin trap.

2656
02:57:11,550 --> 02:57:13,910
What are you guys talking about?

2657
02:57:14,910 --> 02:57:17,570
It's their lucky, lucky day.

2658
02:57:18,590 --> 02:57:20,010
Superpowers are amazing.

2659
02:57:21,070 --> 02:57:22,810
Any solo cures?

2660
02:57:22,810 --> 02:57:24,730
looking for a duo?

2661
02:57:25,810 --> 02:57:32,970
I've already I've already ruined two duos in the span of 24 hours.

2662
02:57:36,250 --> 02:57:37,750
I don't mind adding another.

2663
02:57:40,070 --> 02:57:41,790
Oh no, Gomez crashed out too.

2664
02:57:45,950 --> 02:57:49,370
I have like freedom from his chains.

2665
02:57:50,110 --> 02:57:53,810
All you need to do is Capture the mission area.

2666
02:57:54,210 --> 02:57:54,760
Got it?

2667
02:57:59,610 --> 02:58:01,590
Today's your lucky day.

2668
02:58:01,870 --> 02:58:03,690
I'm looking for new duos.

2669
02:58:06,250 --> 02:58:08,330
He was top 500.

2670
02:58:13,410 --> 02:58:15,750
It was a good...

2671
02:58:15,750 --> 02:58:16,770
Good effort.

2672
02:58:17,950 --> 02:58:18,110
There

2673
02:58:21,780 --> 02:58:23,260
you go.

2674
02:58:26,360 --> 02:58:27,800
Oh, that's unfortunate.

2675
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:31,920
I mean, I got the freeze, though.

2676
02:58:32,640 --> 02:58:34,060
So, like, I did my job.

2677
02:58:35,300 --> 02:58:36,460
Wait, how do we not have what?

2678
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:37,580
Oh, that's bad.

2679
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:38,660
I don't smoke.

2680
02:58:40,280 --> 02:58:40,720
Alright.

2681
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:46,840
The only thing that sucks is that...

2682
02:58:46,840 --> 02:58:47,640
Oh, my God.

2683
02:58:47,720 --> 02:58:48,380
It's that they're running.

2684
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:48,860
Never mind.

2685
02:58:49,340 --> 02:58:50,400
They're running triple support.

2686
02:58:51,300 --> 02:58:52,320
That's pretty bad.

2687
02:58:54,180 --> 02:58:54,620
Oh, wait.

2688
02:58:56,360 --> 02:58:57,440
Iron Man?

2689
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:58,000
Okay.

2690
02:58:59,160 --> 02:58:59,760
Okay.

2691
02:59:00,560 --> 02:59:01,340
That's fine.

2692
02:59:01,880 --> 02:59:02,660
I was gonna sit.

2693
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:08,860
Oh my god, thank god.

2694
02:59:08,980 --> 02:59:10,640
I literally just started my...

2695
02:59:11,660 --> 02:59:12,540
Oh, hello.

2696
02:59:13,820 --> 02:59:14,340
Nippy.

2697
02:59:14,660 --> 02:59:16,180
Oh my god, hello again.

2698
02:59:19,060 --> 02:59:22,240
Alright, let's just dance, I guess.

2699
02:59:22,920 --> 02:59:24,120
Oh my god.

2700
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:27,720
There was no way I can fix that.

2701
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:31,060
What the fuck?

2702
02:59:31,180 --> 02:59:31,920
How did he...

2703
02:59:36,750 --> 02:59:37,960
Alright, it's fine.

2704
02:59:41,700 --> 02:59:44,360
Wait, there's a sidewalk there.

2705
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:45,320
It's okay.

2706
02:59:46,200 --> 02:59:47,800
The top 500 rank?

2707
02:59:47,900 --> 02:59:49,010
I can fix that.

2708
02:59:51,670 --> 02:59:54,500
The badge is not that cool anyway.

2709
02:59:56,490 --> 02:59:59,500
You don't need that badge.

2710
02:59:59,860 --> 03:00:07,940
Come on It's not as cool as you think you guys

2711
03:00:12,680 --> 03:00:18,480
You know what sucks is because I fucked up a little bit because

2712
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:29,800
Because Goodbye hello yeah Okay, I have plaque now

2713
03:00:33,500 --> 03:00:35,000
I have clap now.

2714
03:00:37,220 --> 03:00:38,780
I was going to say they have sila.

2715
03:00:39,700 --> 03:00:41,200
Oh, and I don't have clap.

2716
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:43,220
I was worried.

2717
03:00:43,460 --> 03:00:45,280
I can't use clap because, like...

2718
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:46,440
Oh, wait, I can use clap.

2719
03:00:46,540 --> 03:00:46,840
JK!

2720
03:00:52,900 --> 03:00:54,440
Oh, Sherpa doesn't even play, right?

2721
03:00:54,440 --> 03:00:56,120
Can he play rivals anymore?

2722
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:57,640
He only plays when he's sponsored.

2723
03:00:59,560 --> 03:01:08,340
He's a deadlock the gamer now he's back on the deadlock grind okay

2724
03:01:11,820 --> 03:01:30,340
I'll try to cloak off okay just oh I'll just say oh I tried to kill cloak all okay sure yeah apparently they did a huge update on deadlock so everyone's playing that again.

2725
03:01:32,620 --> 03:01:35,720
I don't need it.

2726
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:37,320
What do I just get the next?

2727
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:39,000
I'll just get the next one.

2728
03:01:39,460 --> 03:01:40,900
That one's shaped like an ass.

2729
03:01:42,520 --> 03:01:45,420
And then people will say, oh my god.

2730
03:01:48,700 --> 03:01:52,740
A little bit of encouragement before the game, you know?

2731
03:01:55,360 --> 03:01:59,280
Damn, Europeans are fucking freaky.

2732
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:01,380
I use clap, we're gonna die.

2733
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:05,160
We're so fucked.

2734
03:02:07,940 --> 03:02:12,580
Oh, I jump over fire.

2735
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:13,140
We're okay.

2736
03:02:13,780 --> 03:02:16,320
I don't know how he lives, but we're okay.

2737
03:02:22,700 --> 03:02:25,240
I thought he said he didn't kill it.

2738
03:02:25,620 --> 03:02:26,340
He lied.

2739
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:26,880
Let's go.

2740
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:28,460
Let's go.

2741
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:31,280
He lied.

2742
03:02:35,920 --> 03:02:37,160
He fucking lied.

2743
03:02:38,580 --> 03:02:39,420
We used three.

2744
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:40,300
Oh, okay.

2745
03:02:40,360 --> 03:02:41,060
We used a lot.

2746
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:41,900
We used four else.

2747
03:02:45,320 --> 03:02:46,400
He lied.

2748
03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:48,680
He told me he could do it.

2749
03:02:50,860 --> 03:02:54,360
Where was my all the where was my cloak kill?

2750
03:02:55,620 --> 03:02:56,760
What was your point?

2751
03:02:57,860 --> 03:03:00,020
I mean, at least they wasted it.

2752
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:00,980
I'm in danger.

2753
03:03:01,220 --> 03:03:01,880
I'm in an og.

2754
03:03:02,840 --> 03:03:03,260
You know?

2755
03:03:03,740 --> 03:03:05,140
That's the little things in life.

2756
03:03:06,460 --> 03:03:07,300
Alright, fuck it.

2757
03:03:07,780 --> 03:03:08,960

Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

Thanks for the shield.

2761
03:03:14,840 --> 03:03:16,280
I don't have to be center stage.

2762
03:03:17,060 --> 03:03:18,600
Jesus Christ, I have to reload.

2763
03:03:23,430 --> 03:03:25,450
I like, he's like, killed me.

2764
03:03:26,050 --> 03:03:27,470
And I'm like, bro, you're up top.

2765
03:03:27,570 --> 03:03:29,030
How am I supposed to heal that?

2766
03:03:30,870 --> 03:03:31,690
Are they high ground?

2767
03:03:31,690 --> 03:03:32,710
What are they doing?

2768
03:03:33,470 --> 03:03:34,390
What is their plan?

2769
03:03:36,730 --> 03:03:38,170
What is their plan?

2770
03:03:38,410 --> 03:03:40,370
My guy's been like chilling for a while.

2771
03:03:41,530 --> 03:03:42,350
What is their plan?

2772
03:03:46,150 --> 03:03:47,290
Oh my god, this is bad.

2773
03:03:47,470 --> 03:03:47,730
This is bad.

2774
03:03:47,910 --> 03:03:48,190
This is bad.

2775
03:03:48,350 --> 03:03:48,650
This is bad.

2776
03:03:49,730 --> 03:03:50,590
This is so bad.

2777
03:03:50,670 --> 03:03:51,230
This is so bad.

2778
03:03:51,490 --> 03:03:52,090
This is okay.

2779
03:03:52,570 --> 03:04:01,890
Oh my god, where am I?

03:04:02,270 --> 03:04:03,550

2789
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:08,940
Okay, wait.

2790
03:05:09,220 --> 03:05:09,940
Do you live?

2791
03:05:10,520 --> 03:05:12,220
Wait, we let her live?

2792
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:13,400
Holy fuck.

2793
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:16,180
We actually let her live.

2794
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:18,040
Did I have a TP?

2795
03:05:19,720 --> 03:05:20,540
Oh, yeah, I have a TP.

2796
03:05:23,440 --> 03:05:24,580
Is he gonna stop it?

2797
03:05:25,360 --> 03:05:27,160
Oh my god!

2798
03:05:27,600 --> 03:05:28,080
Legend!

2799
03:05:28,560 --> 03:05:29,800
He didn't stop it.

2800
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:34,200
Legend!

2801
03:05:35,160 --> 03:05:36,380
He didn't stop it.

2802
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:40,080
It's a good effort.

2803
03:05:40,200 --> 03:05:40,360
Hello.

2804
03:05:40,520 --> 03:05:41,320

2805
03:05:42,820 --> 03:05:43,240
Yay!

2806
03:05:46,400 --> 03:05:49,500
Where did he go?

2807
03:05:50,540 --> 03:05:51,360
There we go.

2808
03:05:52,120 --> 03:05:52,760

2810
03:05:55,260 --> 03:05:56,700
We can keep EU.

2811
03:05:57,280 --> 03:06:05,620
We win.

2812
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:06,820
EU stays.

2813
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:10,080
Oh my god, the great dumbass.

2814
03:06:10,240 --> 03:06:10,500
Thank you for...

2815
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:36,000
for the hundred and fifty dollars donation thank you thank you i really appreciate it thank you so much bye doki okay what did he play okay bye bye i don't know what the do i say okay

2816
03:06:40,520 --> 03:08:04,430
uh less paying out from eu frankfurt or warsaw all right let's see uh oh yeah it's mid-autumn festival yeah it's like a long break for everyone um frankfurt 154 frankfurt is the lowest there you go i have tried deadlock i'm just dumb i'm not too dumb for it because you have to oh the issue is it about it is that you have to like change your builds and everything um depending on the situation and i'm too stupid for that i can like you know i'm a hero shooter type of person so like you know i don't mind you know like i just swap oh this character counters that character but then for builds it's so much more complicated because there's so much like so many different items and everything and even though you have like this little guide and stuff like it's still like so complicated to like understand um but it's just i never played a moba before like deadlock was my very first technical technically deadlock was my very first moba to learn but even then i was just like so confused even with

2817
03:08:04,430 --> 03:08:08,950
the guides in it Like with the little, like, you know, like the, the builds that you can follow.

2818
03:08:09,410 --> 03:08:12,290
And I was just like, I don't fucking know how to do builds.

2819
03:08:12,450 --> 03:08:15,230
Like, I don't know when to swap my items or sell my items.

2820
03:08:15,610 --> 03:08:26,670
And also, also the one thing I hate about MOBAs is that the, the fucking beginning part of the MOBA is so boring.

2821
03:08:27,470 --> 03:08:30,710
You just look at each other and shoot at creep.

2822
03:08:31,050 --> 03:08:35,110
Like for like 20 plus minutes.

2823
03:08:35,650 --> 03:08:40,190
I'm just I just I just so boring.

2824
03:08:40,370 --> 03:08:48,530
It's just so The laning phase I just I'm so I'm just it's so slow.

2825
03:08:48,730 --> 03:08:56,250
It's a very slow It felt it feels like when you get to the actual action when you get your build like you know You can finally kill people.

2826
03:08:56,630 --> 03:08:56,990
It's fun.

2827
03:08:57,130 --> 03:08:57,390
It's fun.

2828
03:08:57,490 --> 03:09:06,530
I because I played deadlock I did I tried it out and it's fun But then when you're in the laning phase and you just stare at each other and you just like, I can't kill you yet.

2829
03:09:06,910 --> 03:09:07,790
Hello, sir, sir.

2830
03:09:07,790 --> 03:09:08,490
Hi there, sir.

2831
03:09:08,770 --> 03:09:10,210
We can't kill each other yet.

2832
03:09:10,410 --> 03:09:16,190
So let's just look at each other and be like, Tee-hee, what if I steal your creed?

2833
03:09:17,190 --> 03:09:21,590
And then you can't do anything about it because I have better ping than you.

2834
03:09:21,870 --> 03:09:22,510
Ha-ha-ha.

2835
03:09:23,050 --> 03:09:24,650
And that's just so fucking stupid.

2836
03:09:24,770 --> 03:09:25,330
I hate it.

2837
03:09:27,310 --> 03:09:29,130
I fucking hate it.

2838
03:09:30,630 --> 03:09:34,070
Oh, you try to get closer to me?

2839
03:09:35,130 --> 03:09:39,310
Let me stand behind my little tower because I'm a bitch boy.

2840
03:09:40,130 --> 03:09:43,150
Because I'm a fucking coward little pussy boy.

2841
03:09:47,450 --> 03:09:57,670
Like if you do one damage to the enemy team during the lane phase, they fucking hide behind a stupid fucking tower.

2842
03:09:57,930 --> 03:09:59,390
And it's so boring.

2843
03:09:59,890 --> 03:10:02,430
It's so goddamn boring.

2844
03:10:05,950 --> 03:10:59,410
yeah i'm that's why that's why deadlock is uh not for me i don't i don't know maybe in the future uh but like for now i just the laning phase is just oh the laning phase is oh i'm too fucking i i cannot i don't have enough patience for it i really don't and also like apparently changed a lot of stuff um because i found out like if you played it before the big update um and then try to play again they keep you at the same rank so like if you don't know like the new because like apparently they changed a lot of stuff so like a lot of characters have new alts and like different abilities and everything and um and so but you still keep your rank from before the big change

2845
03:11:02,510 --> 03:12:02,510
It's like You could get absolutely fucked If you come back And you're like, I forgot to play Because there's no quick play It's just ranked Oh no, there's no I know there isn't DK Because Because like One of my friends played it again And then they got put into like And before they were like the third The fourth ranked though two of my friends two of my friends one was like the third highest rank and the other one was the fourth highest rank and they recently downloaded the game to play again and they were put in that same lobby like it did not decay so I was like oh it sucks to be you I guess it sucks to be both of you because I was watching one of my friends play it and they were like they used to be the third or fourth highest rank and they were getting yelled at non-stop by their teammates because they were like

2846
03:12:05,770 --> 03:12:10,150
They were, because they're like, why are you in this ELO?

2847
03:12:10,470 --> 03:12:13,010
And then my boyfriend was like, I don't understand.

2848
03:12:13,850 --> 03:12:15,450
I can't kill anything.

2849
03:12:15,790 --> 03:12:17,450
Everything is so different.

2850
03:12:20,530 --> 03:12:22,990
They're like, I'm fucking, I don't remember what they were playing.

2851
03:12:23,710 --> 03:12:24,470
Blah, blah, blah.

2852
03:12:25,210 --> 03:12:27,450
It's feeding his ass out.

2853
03:12:28,990 --> 03:12:31,370
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

2854
03:12:31,430 --> 03:12:33,870
Oh, maybe I should have taken you out.

2855
03:12:35,330 --> 03:12:42,350
I don't know This doesn't seem ideal Because oh there you go We have a tank player I was gonna say

2856
03:12:46,170 --> 03:12:58,630
Remove EU from the rankings From the From the server I was gonna be like This looks scary

I was not safe.

2916
03:17:40,930 --> 03:17:43,490

The moment the Groot ults us and then the Iron Man ults too, they're fucked, but that's okay.

2951
03:19:55,150 --> 03:20:07,310
At least I pushed the point know yeah i'm doing there they go don't worry i'm i'm shooting it there we go

2954
03:20:29,220 --> 03:20:31,160
Holy shit, she's still alive.

2955
03:20:31,700 --> 03:20:33,840
Guys, please don't stand next to the gruel.

2956
03:20:35,720 --> 03:20:39,440
Oh my, oh my god.

2957
03:20:39,920 --> 03:20:41,820
Okay, I did it.

2958
03:20:42,060 --> 03:20:42,960
I don't know how.

2959
03:20:43,540 --> 03:20:44,040
I don't.

2960
03:20:44,820 --> 03:20:46,660
I don't know how.

2961
03:20:47,220 --> 03:20:48,580
Oh my god.

2962
03:20:49,800 --> 03:20:52,720
I farmed so much all charge.

2963
03:20:55,920 --> 03:21:03,740

2965
03:21:27,480 --> 03:21:28,480
That's right.

2966
03:21:30,920 --> 03:21:32,040
Where am I?

2967
03:21:36,520 --> 03:21:39,380
Yeah, I'm on a user risk because I'm doing them in U-player.

2968
03:21:42,520 --> 03:21:44,740
I'm not the type who fades quietly into the back.

2969
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:45,060
Good.

2970
03:21:45,280 --> 03:21:46,520
Now you see me.

2971
03:21:47,380 --> 03:21:48,560
Now you don't.

2972
03:21:56,050 --> 03:21:56,910
That's right.

2973
03:21:57,310 --> 03:21:58,330
You see that mag?

2974
03:21:58,510 --> 03:21:59,870
He's like, where did she go?

2975
03:22:02,110 --> 03:22:04,530
The mag was trying so hard to find me.

2976
03:22:04,610 --> 03:22:06,810
She's like, where did she go?

2977
03:22:07,230 --> 03:22:08,430
She was just there.

2978
03:22:14,500 --> 03:22:15,480
That's right.

2979
03:22:16,120 --> 03:22:17,600
This is how I like invisible woman wear.

2980
03:22:18,380 --> 03:22:22,460
I feel like more freedom playing her compared to the other supports.

2981
03:22:24,900 --> 03:22:26,060
I just feel...

2982
03:22:26,060 --> 03:22:26,640
It's just...

2983
03:22:26,640 --> 03:22:27,300
I don't know.

2984
03:22:27,400 --> 03:22:29,640
I can try less, I guess.

2985
03:22:30,120 --> 03:22:33,200
I think that's it.

2986
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:35,320
I don't have to really aim.

2987
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:37,360
Playing Invisible Women.

2988
03:22:38,040 --> 03:22:41,180
Because Luna, you gotta hit like all the freezes.

2989
03:22:41,840 --> 03:22:43,300
You gotta hit all the freezes.

2990
03:22:43,620 --> 03:22:44,580
You gotta clap.

2991
03:22:44,680 --> 03:22:46,560
You gotta save your clap for important.

2992
03:22:46,720 --> 03:22:47,700
Me just go.

2993
03:22:47,740 --> 03:22:48,600
He, he, he.

2994
03:22:49,140 --> 03:22:51,020

03:22:51,420 --> 03:22:52,980
And then he, he, he.

2996
03:22:53,340 --> 03:22:56,180
I press shift on, cool down.

2997
03:22:56,900 --> 03:22:57,220
He, he.

2998
03:22:57,400 --> 03:23:44,340
I put that he he and then when people know I go I put shield up it's just so much easier it's just a lot easier to handle and then I know so let me just oh I know oh my god okay this is bad does that look at that so easy oh look at that and then who's shooting at us and then i pull her back see it's just that easy and eliminated god has a worthy sorcerer luna's too much work i'm lazy now

2999
03:23:47,640 --> 03:23:49,780
I'm so lazy now.

3000
03:23:50,240 --> 03:23:52,820
Sorry, I used to be Celestia.

3001
03:23:52,940 --> 03:23:56,820
I peaked Celestia 2 in this season.

3002
03:23:57,060 --> 03:23:59,160
I actually, I peaked one of above all, but not.

3003
03:24:00,140 --> 03:24:02,340
Oh my god, oh he is.

3004
03:24:02,820 --> 03:24:04,360
Oh my god, it's okay.

3005
03:24:04,920 --> 03:24:05,980
We go in!

3006
03:24:06,240 --> 03:24:06,940
Let's go!

3007
03:24:08,060 --> 03:24:11,920
Oh my god, I didn't think she also had a...

3008
03:24:11,920 --> 03:24:13,260
Oh my god.

3009
03:24:15,080 --> 03:24:16,020
Look at that.

3010
03:24:16,580 --> 03:24:16,780
See?

3011
03:24:17,640 --> 03:24:25,320
Just you just just like that just like that Yeah, more effort than rocket

3012
03:24:29,240 --> 03:24:37,400
This meter has a person that would bottom 500 player What do you mean?

3013
03:24:38,300 --> 03:24:48,100
I am not that toxic I don't say anything in VC I We're so dead.

3014
03:24:48,420 --> 03:24:49,060
We're so dead.

3015
03:24:49,220 --> 03:24:51,580
We're so Goodbye, friends.

3016
03:24:53,200 --> 03:24:54,790
It was nice knowing all of you.

3017
03:24:59,620 --> 03:25:02,520
I don't say it to their faces.

3018
03:25:03,640 --> 03:25:05,580
If they check back the bot, that's on them.

3019
03:25:05,880 --> 03:25:06,940
That's on them.

3020
03:25:07,740 --> 03:25:09,020
If they check the bots.

3021
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:15,200
But, like, look, it's like our own, you know, it's our own private time, you know?

3022
03:25:15,620 --> 03:25:17,640
Like, oh my god.

3023
03:25:17,980 --> 03:25:19,760
Oh, what did my lord do?

3024
03:25:19,780 --> 03:25:22,620
Oh my god, we both died.

3025
03:25:22,860 --> 03:25:23,040
Okay.

3026
03:25:24,240 --> 03:25:26,140
I thought my Luna was with me.

3027
03:25:26,720 --> 03:25:27,320
Oh, that sucks.

3028
03:25:27,460 --> 03:25:27,700
We're not here.

3029
03:25:27,920 --> 03:25:28,280
Can't touch.

3030
03:25:28,560 --> 03:25:30,660
Oh, we fucked up the pre-contest.

3031
03:25:32,460 --> 03:25:33,380
We can't touch.

3032
03:25:33,560 --> 03:25:34,300
I don't think so.

3033
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:36,280
I don't think we're touching now.

3034
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:36,540
Yeah.

3035
03:25:36,880 --> 03:25:37,740
Goodbye, everybody.

3036
03:25:38,060 --> 03:25:39,580
You guys can go the long...

3037
03:25:39,580 --> 03:25:40,160
Oh, wait.

3038
03:25:40,400 --> 03:25:40,940
Oh, okay.

3039
03:25:41,540 --> 03:25:43,340
Okay, I was gonna leave them.

3040
03:25:44,860 --> 03:25:45,780
We all came...

3041
03:25:47,340 --> 03:25:47,860
Okay.

3042
03:25:49,780 --> 03:25:52,260
because they have the combo.

3043
03:25:53,160 --> 03:25:54,060
Oh my god.

3044
03:25:54,480 --> 03:25:54,800
Okay.

3045
03:25:56,400 --> 03:25:57,580
Do we...

3046
03:25:57,580 --> 03:25:58,660
Do we kill anyone?

3047
03:25:59,120 --> 03:26:00,340
Oh my god.

3048
03:26:00,980 --> 03:26:01,880
Oh my god.

3049
03:26:02,080 --> 03:26:03,260
They killed our Luna.

3050
03:26:05,100 --> 03:26:06,000
Oh my...

3051
03:26:06,300 --> 03:26:07,820
Guys, I'm scared.

3052
03:26:08,400 --> 03:26:09,860
Guys, I'm scared.

3053
03:26:09,980 --> 03:26:11,720
I don't know how to get out of here.

3054
03:26:12,100 --> 03:26:12,380
I...

3055
03:26:12,380 --> 03:26:14,040
I don't...

3056
03:26:14,040 --> 03:26:14,980
Alright.

3057
03:26:16,040 --> 03:26:17,720
Yeah, both of us just got snapped.

3058
03:26:18,000 --> 03:26:19,760
I want to let our...

3059
03:26:19,780 --> 03:26:23,360
Luna build up, but I don't know where our Luna is.

3060
03:26:23,520 --> 03:26:24,160
Oh, she's here.

3061
03:26:24,820 --> 03:26:25,060
Okay.

3062
03:26:25,700 --> 03:26:27,060
I'll just top her off.

3063
03:26:27,340 --> 03:26:32,040
Oh, yeah, they definitely do.

3064
03:26:32,320 --> 03:26:36,660
The only thing we can do is we don't group up, but, like, this is very hard.

3065
03:26:42,100 --> 03:26:44,160
Alright, this is what we do.

3066
03:26:45,580 --> 03:26:50,360
Okay, I might have ulted early, but I got very scared.

3067
03:26:51,480 --> 03:26:53,620
I heard the dark child.

3068
03:26:54,300 --> 03:26:56,200
Where did the dark child go?

3069
03:26:59,380 --> 03:27:01,980
Jesus Christ that's he's looking for it.

3070
03:27:02,160 --> 03:27:02,360
He is.

3071
03:27:02,740 --> 03:27:04,480
Oh, that's the dark child was there.

3072
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:05,440
I see him.

3073
03:27:05,500 --> 03:27:15,340
I see him He doesn't know I'm here He doesn't know they don't know See it's so easy

3074
03:27:18,900 --> 03:28:23,060

03:28:24,800 --> 03:28:25,320

3078
03:28:34,630 --> 03:28:34,930
Okay.

We got him.

3080
03:28:38,290 --> 03:28:38,690
We got him.

3081
03:28:39,630 --> 03:28:40,610
Okay, we're dead though.

3082
03:28:41,010 --> 03:28:41,010
Oh!

3083
03:28:42,170 --> 03:28:43,470
He found me!

3084
03:28:43,710 --> 03:28:44,810
How did he find me?

3085
03:28:47,230 --> 03:28:48,330
How did he find me?

3086
03:28:51,520 --> 03:28:52,820
I... Oh, what?

3087
03:29:02,700 --> 03:29:05,500
She just wasn't even looking at me.

3088
03:29:06,580 --> 03:29:07,480
This is bad.

3089
03:29:07,660 --> 03:29:08,020
This is actually...

3090
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:21,260
lose a book because of the magic and the group okay they're they're building a lot of well this

3091
03:29:24,450 --> 03:29:39,610
is actually pretty loseable I'm just gonna I'm healing bottom I assume that yeah I need all the charge too girl we're competing

3092
03:29:43,610 --> 03:29:44,090
Arluna!

3093
03:29:58,200 --> 03:29:59,440
Oh, that's unlucky.

3094
03:29:59,680 --> 03:30:01,360
I don't even know what happened to me.

3095
03:30:02,960 --> 03:30:04,000
Like, what the fuck?

3096
03:30:05,500 --> 03:30:06,840
Okay, I have a...

3097
03:30:10,180 --> 03:30:11,100
Where is she?

3098
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:15,600
Okay, I have to use this to stabilize.

3099
03:30:16,380 --> 03:30:19,720
But the only issue is that Groot absolutely has all that after.

3100
03:30:26,160 --> 03:30:27,320
Woo-hoo-hoo!

3101
03:30:27,440 --> 03:30:27,800
Woo-hoo!

3102
03:30:27,840 --> 03:30:28,320
I live.

3103
03:30:30,560 --> 03:30:31,420
I don't know.

3104
03:30:31,560 --> 03:30:33,240
We'll live this.

3105
03:30:34,220 --> 03:30:35,020
No, we're not.

3106
03:30:35,660 --> 03:30:37,200
We will not live this now.

3107
03:30:39,180 --> 03:30:44,100
The best thing I can do is perhaps keep each other alive.

3108
03:30:50,260 --> 03:30:51,100
Oh my god!

3109
03:30:51,360 --> 03:30:52,460
Oh, I almost killed the Luna!

3110
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:53,840
Oh!

3111
03:30:56,580 --> 03:30:57,600
Oh, we're stacked.

3112
03:30:57,620 --> 03:30:59,600
We're so staggered now.

3113
03:30:59,880 --> 03:31:01,100
Oh, that sucks.

3114
03:31:01,200 --> 03:31:05,340
I almost killed our Luna What the fuck?

3115
03:31:05,660 --> 03:31:07,520
Oh So close.

3116
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:09,630
This is actually a lot scarier now

3117
03:31:14,920 --> 03:31:28,580
I Think our Luna Alted that way too soon I was hoping my alt I used my alt as an engagement Hoping that we could grab kills, but we couldn't do it.

3118
03:31:28,620 --> 03:31:29,700
I don't know why our Luna ulted.

3119
03:31:29,840 --> 03:31:31,840
I think we didn't need need to use that.

3120
03:31:33,540 --> 03:31:34,560
Wolverine open too.

3121
03:31:35,420 --> 03:31:38,600
But I don't think any one of us can play wall.

3122
03:31:45,810 --> 03:31:47,170
That sucks.

3123
03:31:47,990 --> 03:31:48,390
Oh well.

3124
03:31:48,850 --> 03:31:49,330
Oh well.

3125
03:31:50,130 --> 03:31:50,570
I think.

3126
03:31:50,730 --> 03:31:51,190
Okay.

3127
03:31:53,210 --> 03:31:56,270
I think I have to play.

3128
03:31:57,210 --> 03:31:57,790
Rocket.

3129
03:32:00,710 --> 03:32:01,590
I think so.

3130
03:32:01,690 --> 03:32:02,210
The damage.

3131
03:32:02,770 --> 03:32:02,930
Hmm.

3132
03:32:02,950 --> 03:33:03,990
actually i don't know i don't know ah i think the res would be important i think that's the res i'm gonna grab i'm gonna bet on the res the res would be clutch i think the res will be clutch we need that res also rocket's getting mega fucking buffed apparently uh next patch so i should have to practice raccoon even though like you don't really need practice no because i look hasn't been meta for so long and now but people can like climb with him because he's so easy to climb with okay it's fine I have res but like all right that doesn't matter though that doesn't matter it's okay our Luna got res though our Luna got res so I also have another res now Ouch.

3133
03:33:04,310 --> 03:33:04,430
I know.

3134
03:33:04,510 --> 03:33:05,230
I didn't think...

3135
03:33:05,230 --> 03:33:07,570
If I was Invis, I think she'd live.

3136
03:33:07,790 --> 03:33:08,290
Actually, no.

3137
03:33:08,590 --> 03:33:09,060
She has...

3138
03:33:11,150 --> 03:33:13,170
Magic has a new one-shot combo.

3139
03:33:13,550 --> 03:33:14,990
Or not new, but this season.

3140
03:33:15,550 --> 03:33:16,730
It's a one-shot combo.

3141
03:33:17,050 --> 03:33:20,290
So I don't think she would have lived even if I...

3142
03:33:20,290 --> 03:33:20,790
What?

3143
03:33:21,930 --> 03:33:22,730
Oh my god.

3144
03:33:22,790 --> 03:33:24,390
Did I actually have to play?

3145
03:33:24,890 --> 03:33:26,270
I should have played Invis.

3146
03:33:26,550 --> 03:33:29,390
I didn't think everyone would have been feeding so hard.

3147
03:33:30,450 --> 03:33:32,270
Everyone is feeding.

3148
03:33:32,950 --> 03:33:34,730
Oh my god.

3149
03:33:35,450 --> 03:33:37,290
Why are you all feeding?

3150
03:33:38,530 --> 03:33:40,170
Oh my god!

3151
03:33:41,450 --> 03:33:42,830
Okay, I'll go in this.

3152
03:33:44,350 --> 03:33:46,510
I did this for the res.

3153
03:33:48,070 --> 03:33:48,990
Everyone's feeding.

3154
03:33:50,310 --> 03:33:52,070
Uh, they're so used to my...

3155
03:33:52,610 --> 03:33:53,250
50!

3156
03:33:53,470 --> 03:33:55,930
Okay, everyone was so used to my heals.

3157
03:33:57,630 --> 03:33:58,270
Yeah.

3158
03:33:59,830 --> 03:34:01,910
Oh my god, my team is...

3159
03:34:01,910 --> 03:34:12,550
my team was so used to my heals being like so strong i think because invis heals does do more

3160
03:34:15,670 --> 03:34:23,570
because i have clutch heals a lot but i literally didn't think they would my team would feel like this

3161
03:34:29,730 --> 03:34:59,360
okay i don't know if this is winner but guys but I will try my best please oh this is bad this is so bad yeah no it's not winnable I can build my own I'm gonna build my own game as fast as I We...

3162
03:34:59,360 --> 03:34:59,880
No!

3163
03:35:00,140 --> 03:35:01,840
Why would you on?!

3164
03:35:01,840 --> 03:35:07,460
Why would you on?!

3165
03:35:07,460 --> 03:35:09,440
Holy shit!

3166
03:35:11,400 --> 03:35:12,060
That's good!

3167
03:35:12,100 --> 03:35:13,820
Oh my god, this TP is so bad.

3168
03:35:14,240 --> 03:35:16,980
This TP is so bad.

3169
03:35:21,320 --> 03:35:22,640
Oh no!

3170
03:35:23,300 --> 03:35:25,860
Of course they mooned that too!

3171
03:35:28,360 --> 03:35:30,820
That was such a bad...

3172
03:35:30,820 --> 03:35:32,820
Why would you put it there?

3173
03:35:35,180 --> 03:35:37,800
Why would you put it there?

3174
03:35:38,860 --> 03:35:40,440
Oh my god.

3175
03:35:42,360 --> 03:35:43,820
This really is doom queuing.

3176
03:35:44,080 --> 03:35:44,600
It is.

3177
03:35:45,220 --> 03:35:46,360
Like, what?

3178
03:35:51,740 --> 03:35:52,640
Oh my.

3179
03:35:52,780 --> 03:35:53,600
That's unfortunate.

3180
03:35:55,500 --> 03:35:56,860
They actually...

3181
03:35:56,860 --> 03:35:58,420
Like, you know what?

3182
03:35:58,520 --> 03:35:59,940
Groot is actually so...

3183
03:35:59,960 --> 03:36:01,160
So easy.

3184
03:36:01,860 --> 03:36:02,460
Like...

3185
03:36:02,460 --> 03:36:04,420
This is so dumb.

3186
03:36:06,460 --> 03:36:07,880
This is so dumb.

3187
03:36:08,820 --> 03:36:09,960
Groot is so easily.

3188
03:36:10,120 --> 03:36:11,300
Literally, you know what you need to play?

3189
03:36:11,960 --> 03:36:13,960
All you have to play is...

3190
03:36:16,680 --> 03:36:17,660
Hey, yeah.

3191
03:36:17,900 --> 03:36:19,580
Yeah, you want to share some health too?

3192
03:36:22,300 --> 03:36:27,080
Clearly all you have to play is Punisher and Wolf.

3193
03:36:27,940 --> 03:36:31,100
And none of us played Punisher Or wolf.

3194
03:36:33,040 --> 03:36:34,460
Time to switch things up.

3195
03:36:35,220 --> 03:36:38,040
So like, oh so dad's awake now.

3196
03:36:38,900 --> 03:36:41,420
He's awake and he's hungry.

3197
03:36:42,080 --> 03:36:44,780
You'll need a top notch team to win this one.

3198
03:36:46,360 --> 03:36:48,400
Your audit blocked it.

3199
03:36:48,520 --> 03:36:49,080
Use Jim.

3200
03:36:49,420 --> 03:36:50,280
I'm sorry.

3201
03:36:53,130 --> 03:36:57,150
I mean he's right.

3202
03:36:58,170 --> 03:36:58,490
Hello.

3203
03:36:59,330 --> 03:37:00,830
He's hungry now.

3204
03:37:01,910 --> 03:37:03,590
I don't remember this guy, my friends.

3205
03:37:03,730 --> 03:37:05,130
I'm sorry if you're watching this stream.

3206
03:37:05,830 --> 03:37:06,550
You don't remember.

3207
03:37:11,510 --> 03:37:12,350
He's up.

3208
03:37:13,230 --> 03:37:13,690
He's up.

3209
03:37:13,870 --> 03:37:15,770
I was like, who's this messaging me?

3210
03:37:16,950 --> 03:37:18,390
No, it's too early.

3211
03:37:18,770 --> 03:37:20,230
It's 7 in the morning.

3212
03:37:20,630 --> 03:37:21,910
It's way too early.

3213
03:37:23,650 --> 03:37:23,990
Oh!

3214
03:37:27,170 --> 03:37:27,630
Jimbo.

3215
03:37:27,670 --> 03:37:29,890
Oh, it's because it's been so long.

3216
03:37:30,070 --> 03:37:30,250
Okay.

3217
03:37:32,210 --> 03:37:52,430

3218
03:38:02,070 --> 03:38:06,710
See, this is why I play, oh my god, oh my god, it's so loud.

3219
03:38:07,250 --> 03:38:11,190
Oh my god, please, I'm fucking trying to play.

3220
03:38:15,690 --> 03:38:18,810
Well, it's like this game got...

3221
03:38:21,730 --> 03:38:24,230
Go away, go away, go away.

3222
03:38:24,290 --> 03:38:24,890
Go away.

3223
03:38:25,730 --> 03:38:27,310
Oh my god, I'm not looking at the screen right now.

3224
03:38:27,590 --> 03:38:29,470
Oh shit, oh shit.

3225
03:38:29,930 --> 03:38:30,790
Oh my god, I got him.

3226
03:38:31,810 --> 03:38:37,050
This is bad though, because we have no combos technically for...

3227
03:38:38,870 --> 03:38:40,050
Oh my god, Dad, please!

3228
03:38:40,270 --> 03:38:41,690
Please, please, please, I can't think.

3229
03:38:42,110 --> 03:38:43,450
I can't think, please.

3230
03:38:44,210 --> 03:38:45,990
Oh my god, it's so loud.

3231
03:38:46,170 --> 03:38:47,190
He's so hungry.

3232
03:38:47,630 --> 03:38:49,010
He's so hungry.

3233
03:38:49,530 --> 03:38:52,450
I can't think and he's so hungry.

3234
03:38:54,110 --> 03:38:56,030
He's so hungry.

3235
03:39:03,610 --> 03:39:05,650
Okay, we reached the checkpoint.

3236
03:39:06,150 --> 03:39:07,390
He's so hungry.

3237
03:39:07,670 --> 03:39:08,830
I can't think

3238
03:39:18,560 --> 03:39:20,040
Okay, that's fine.

3239
03:39:20,260 --> 03:39:20,440
That's fine.

3240
03:39:20,620 --> 03:39:20,900
It's fine.

3241
03:39:21,400 --> 03:39:22,520
Oh my god.

3242
03:39:22,580 --> 03:39:46,200

Goodbye, everybody.

3252
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:35,500
Goodbye.

3253
03:40:36,140 --> 03:40:36,460
Goodbye.

3254
03:40:40,440 --> 03:40:42,360
I gotta feed my dog.

3255
03:40:42,780 --> 03:40:44,320
Give me a second.

3256
03:40:45,300 --> 03:40:46,020
Oh, my God.

3257
03:41:26,190 --> 03:41:27,730
Also, I gotta pee.

3258
03:41:27,950 --> 03:41:28,970
I could be right back.

3259
03:41:29,350 --> 03:41:31,350
I'm gonna make sure that it's so cute.

3260
03:41:31,810 --> 03:41:32,850
All right, I'll be right back.

3261
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:22,900
I'm back.

3262
03:42:23,600 --> 03:42:24,020
Was this she?

3263
03:42:24,120 --> 03:42:25,920
No, you wanna, I was Celestia 2.

3264
03:42:26,460 --> 03:42:27,660
I was Celestia 2.

3265
03:42:28,460 --> 03:42:31,920
I was three games off from securing top 500.

3266
03:42:32,360 --> 03:42:33,660
And then I lost 7.

3267
03:42:33,680 --> 03:43:33,240
in a row and now i'm in gm1 and i've given up i'm gonna get oh it's even worse oh that was off stream though i lost them in a row off stream and then i was like it's fixable this i can fix this and then i got further and further away and then i knew i was at the acceptance stage and i turned on stream because i knew it was over i i knew it wasn't coming back i i i did not fix it um so so that's why we're here today and i need to reset my sleep schedule um doing trying to get top 500 um this season really fucked up my sleep schedule and it sucks because like that's why i was like crashing out before stream i wanted to cry before stream so i was like that's why i decided stream because stream for you guys always cheers me up a lot But like before stream,

3268
03:43:33,420 --> 03:43:51,040

Wait, Russia's European?

3273
03:44:39,380 --> 03:44:41,060
I thought he was...

3274
03:44:41,060 --> 03:44:42,540
He's European?

3275
03:44:43,540 --> 03:44:45,960
I thought he was NA.

3276
03:44:46,260 --> 03:44:48,300
I guess he was apparently European.

3277
03:44:49,400 --> 03:44:51,720
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say.

3278
03:44:52,100 --> 03:44:52,940
No, he's just...

3279
03:44:52,940 --> 03:44:53,960
No, he is NA.

3280
03:44:54,360 --> 03:44:57,220
He's also a secret Elo terrorist.

3281
03:44:57,920 --> 03:44:59,660
He's an Elo terrorist just like me.

3282
03:45:00,720 --> 03:45:03,940
Here to ruin other people's games and different servers.

3283
03:45:07,750 --> 03:45:08,770
Let's go.

3284
03:45:11,370 --> 03:45:13,770
We're here to ruin the experience.

3285
03:45:18,210 --> 03:45:18,850
Also, like, I don't...

3286
03:45:18,850 --> 03:45:20,530
There's so many, like, serve.

3287
03:45:20,710 --> 03:45:26,010
Like, I realize all the best, like, game servers are on the East Coast.

3288
03:45:26,210 --> 03:45:27,170
I don't understand why.

3289
03:45:35,510 --> 03:45:39,150
I feel like like everyone just queues East Coast these days.

3290
03:45:48,460 --> 03:45:50,500
No, but, like...

3291
03:45:50,500 --> 03:45:51,160
But, like...

3292
03:45:55,340 --> 03:46:04,800
But like a lot, not just that, but it's still like majority of my games I play for rivals is on the East Coast server, because majority of the players on the East Coast for some fucking reason.

3293
03:46:06,360 --> 03:46:09,340
Also I think like most of the servers are there too.

3294
03:46:09,680 --> 03:46:10,120
Alright.

3295
03:46:12,020 --> 03:46:12,940

Yet here you are.

3326
03:50:50,520 --> 03:50:52,040
Fighting for the good of all.

3327
03:50:52,300 --> 03:50:54,180
Okay, he is not a support player.

3328
03:50:54,840 --> 03:50:56,200
Alright, that's good to know.

3329
03:50:56,220 --> 03:50:58,010
They're not a support player.

3330
03:50:58,700 --> 03:51:01,720
This is why I'm dune queuing, guys.

3331

Alright, here we go.

3339
03:51:24,650 --> 03:51:26,510
Now I'm fine with surrendering.

3340
03:51:26,930 --> 03:51:28,970
These games are so bad.

3341
03:51:30,950 --> 03:51:38,530

Okay.

I hope...

3350
03:52:24,060 --> 03:52:26,740
I'm just hoping that he heals first, not me.

3351
03:52:30,360 --> 03:52:33,160
I hope she's... he's okay over there.

3352
03:52:34,080 --> 03:52:35,360

3353
03:52:35,960 --> 03:52:36,560

That's a Luna player right there!

3358
03:53:09,680 --> 03:53:10,300
You saw that?

3359
03:53:10,540 --> 03:53:12,380
We protected each other!

3360
03:53:13,520 --> 03:53:16,140
That's a Luna player right there!

3361
03:53:16,640 --> 03:53:19,280
Now you see why I was like, this guy does not play Luna.

3362
03:53:19,620 --> 03:53:21,340
This guy actually does not play support.

3363
03:53:21,460 --> 03:53:21,940
You can tell.

3364
03:53:22,260 --> 03:53:23,600
You can fucking tell.

3365
03:53:24,300 --> 03:53:27,760
Because like, you're supposed to peel each other.

3366
03:53:31,520 --> 03:53:32,980
Did he do anything?

3367
03:53:33,960 --> 03:53:34,540
Jesus Christ.

3368
03:53:37,200 --> 03:53:37,900
Where?

3369
03:53:39,160 --> 03:53:40,320

3370
03:53:42,780 --> 03:53:43,060
Hello.

03:53:44,160 --> 03:53:45,600
There you go.

3372
03:53:47,120 --> 03:53:48,870
That's a fucking Luna player.

3373
03:53:50,920 --> 03:53:52,560
Where's he coming from?

3374
03:53:52,760 --> 03:53:54,700
Oh my god, that's where he came from.

3375
03:53:56,580 --> 03:53:57,280
Okay.

3376
03:53:59,440 --> 03:54:00,440
Alright, he walks off.

3377
03:54:07,640 --> 03:54:08,220
Yeah.

3378
03:54:09,500 --> 03:54:10,080
So yeah.

3379
03:54:11,220 --> 03:55:12,460

I did.

3381
03:55:13,340 --> 03:55:14,940
I became a variety streamer.

3382
03:55:15,620 --> 03:55:17,360
I want to alt early.

3383
03:55:22,340 --> 03:55:23,980
We got nobody.

3384
03:55:24,280 --> 03:55:25,440
Let's go.

3385
03:55:26,640 --> 03:55:27,740
Let's go.

3386
03:55:29,020 --> 03:55:29,660
Let's go.

3387
03:55:29,980 --> 03:55:31,540
Okay, we...

3388
03:55:31,540 --> 03:55:32,940
Let's go, I guess.

3389
03:55:34,760 --> 03:55:36,300
Where am I?

3390
03:55:36,900 --> 03:55:39,040
I'm so lost.

3391
03:55:39,720 --> 03:55:41,020
Where am I?

3392
03:55:41,420 --> 03:55:43,040
I'm gonna use this.

3393
03:55:43,060 --> 03:55:43,740
I don't know.

3394
03:55:44,100 --> 03:55:47,400
I don't know.

3395
03:55:47,520 --> 03:55:48,680
I feel so lost.

3396
03:55:49,520 --> 03:55:54,380
Okay, I don't know if we should have used two odds, but I was so confused.

3397
03:55:55,160 --> 03:55:57,480
I felt like we needed it.

3398
03:56:02,490 --> 03:56:06,370
Maybe we shouldn't have used both support odds.

3399
03:56:10,460 --> 03:56:11,080
All right.

3400
03:56:13,200 --> 03:56:14,200
All right, it's fine.

3401
03:56:14,320 --> 03:56:14,820
Oh my god.

3402
03:56:17,400 --> 03:56:19,380
Oh my god, we died.

3403
03:56:19,560 --> 03:56:19,900
It's okay.

3404
03:56:22,520 --> 03:56:24,300
We didn't have patty cake.

3405
03:56:24,960 --> 03:56:25,220
That's fine.

3406
03:56:25,360 --> 03:56:26,260
We still win this.

3407
03:56:26,740 --> 03:56:28,680
We didn't... She didn't have...

3408
03:56:28,680 --> 03:56:30,360
She didn't have...

3409
03:56:30,700 --> 03:56:32,200
There's a... The shift.

3410
03:56:33,180 --> 03:56:33,320
Clap.

3411
03:56:34,480 --> 03:56:36,060
If she had clap, we'd live.

3412
03:56:36,380 --> 03:56:37,320
But she didn't have it.

3413
03:56:38,120 --> 03:56:39,220
That's all she needed.

3414
03:56:39,980 --> 03:56:42,400
Because I healed as much as I could.

3415
03:56:43,500 --> 03:56:45,200
But she needed the extra heal.

3416
03:56:46,180 --> 03:56:48,860
if we stacked, I think if we stacked, we could have lived, though, for sure.

3417
03:56:49,440 --> 03:56:50,320
We just didn't stack.

3418
03:56:52,880 --> 03:56:53,740
Oh, my god.

3419
03:56:54,080 --> 03:56:57,560
Oh, oh, oh, I don't know where I am.

3420
03:56:57,860 --> 03:56:59,320
Oh, my god, he's dead.

3421
03:57:02,120 --> 03:57:04,060
Didn't know where I am.

3422
03:57:05,060 --> 03:57:06,020
Peek-a-boo.

3423
03:57:06,680 --> 03:57:07,120
Oh, yeah.

3424
03:57:10,480 --> 03:57:11,700
I got it.

3425
03:57:11,960 --> 03:57:13,160
Oh, well, she got it.

3426
03:57:14,640 --> 03:57:15,300
There you go.

3427
03:57:15,580 --> 03:57:17,180
Four hours It does not feel like 4-Has.

3428
03:57:17,220 --> 03:57:18,400
I just love streaming Ravos.

3429
03:57:19,260 --> 03:57:20,080
I love streaming Rink.

3430
03:57:20,600 --> 03:57:29,180
I think if I was playing any other Rink and I'm like super into it, if you guys knew me from like peak Apex, I could stream Apex for like 10 hours.

3431
03:57:30,800 --> 03:57:33,960
TP, TP, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P.

3432
03:57:38,860 --> 03:57:40,980
I could really, you don't understand.

3433
03:57:41,940 --> 03:57:43,100
That's how much...

3434
03:57:44,020 --> 03:57:44,960
That's how much...

3435
03:57:46,180 --> 03:57:46,720
Ah!

3436
03:57:47,580 --> 03:57:49,020
Ah, and again!

3437
03:57:53,320 --> 03:57:53,960
Okay.

3438
03:57:55,320 --> 03:57:57,040
See, that's a natural Luna play.

3439
03:57:58,340 --> 03:58:00,340
Oh, I fucked up the push.

3440
03:58:01,080 --> 03:58:02,600
I almost pushed him.

3441
03:58:03,200 --> 03:58:04,040
Did he get him?

3442
03:58:11,590 --> 03:58:12,230
Toby!

3443
03:58:20,460 --> 03:58:22,400
Into the hole you go.

3444
03:58:22,860 --> 03:58:25,140
Another epic victory.

3445
03:58:25,960 --> 03:58:27,520
Two for two.

3446
03:58:28,260 --> 03:58:28,920
Wolfie.

3447
03:58:30,980 --> 03:58:32,300
What's this?

3448
03:58:32,960 --> 03:58:33,700
GG's.

3449
03:58:33,940 --> 03:58:35,560
Hope all of you know.

3450
03:58:36,140 --> 03:58:37,800
Nobody wants to kill us all of you.

3451
03:58:38,600 --> 03:58:40,660
Best Invis with me?

3452
03:58:41,280 --> 03:58:41,540

3453
03:58:44,880 --> 03:58:45,760
Me!

3454
03:58:46,880 --> 03:58:49,160
Wait, unless he's talking about Akari.

3455
03:58:49,960 --> 03:58:51,220
Is he talking about me?

3456
03:58:51,800 --> 03:58:52,640
That's me!

3457
03:58:56,320 --> 03:59:08,100
who yes glazed me I typed who please respond me

3458
03:59:14,140 --> 03:59:54,860
I know it's me I just want him to say it I know it glaze me i need all i can get fishing for compliments i've been dupe queuing i need this self-esteem boost right now literally the game two games before one of them called me a shitter and said i can't be real and i need this win two games before another player yelled at me

3459
03:59:59,700 --> 04:00:23,980
I need this I need it my own she is real yay I need a double dip glaze yay he said I'm good BFB I don't even know what I did I guess like I peeled I think it's because I peeled for my Luna.

3460
04:00:24,700 --> 04:00:25,620
See, that's what you know.

3461
04:00:25,660 --> 04:00:27,300
That other support actually plays support.

3462
04:00:27,540 --> 04:00:29,560
Like, we both actually peeled for each other.

3463
04:00:31,060 --> 04:00:31,760
And everything.

3464
04:00:33,620 --> 04:00:36,960
Like, the other Luna did not fucking care about my life.

3465
04:00:37,640 --> 04:00:39,140
She was like, you die?

3466
04:00:39,440 --> 04:00:40,500
I guess you die.

3467
04:00:41,040 --> 04:00:41,300
Yeah.

3468
04:00:41,420 --> 04:00:45,160
And then the support, we both actually looked at each other and healed each other.

3469
04:00:49,450 --> 04:00:49,950
Yeah.

3470
04:00:51,590 --> 04:00:52,910
But I've been that push.

3471
04:00:53,030 --> 04:00:54,590
I mean, it's like, usual.

3472
04:00:54,610 --> 04:01:01,590
invisible thing like women that's why i like playing invisible women you do you do less but you have more of an impact

3473
04:01:05,640 --> 04:01:24,200
like like you do less but you but you are like worth more to the team e-o-m-m final boss but like when i play azuna i feel like i could do so many things and we still lose.

3474
04:01:25,660 --> 04:01:30,600
It's just, and then when you're invisible woman, you can get away.

3475
04:01:32,000 --> 04:01:36,240
You can like get away, you can like get away with mistakes easier.

3476
04:01:37,420 --> 04:01:41,280
But when you're playing Luna, like you make one mistake and then it's over.

3477
04:01:41,620 --> 04:01:45,040
As invisible woman, if I misposition myself, I can just go invisible.

3478
04:01:45,840 --> 04:01:47,660
That, I disappear.

3479
04:01:48,380 --> 04:01:48,900
That's it.

3480
04:01:49,600 --> 04:01:50,020
That's it.

3481
04:01:50,080 --> 04:01:51,740
I don't even need to stand in my arm.

3482
04:01:53,480 --> 04:01:54,660
I literally just...

3483
04:01:54,660 --> 04:01:55,760
No, she took him...

3484
04:01:55,760 --> 04:01:56,080
No!

3485
04:01:57,160 --> 04:01:58,780
She took invisible woman.

3486
04:01:59,560 --> 04:01:59,900
No!

3487
04:02:01,000 --> 04:02:04,720
But yeah, I literally just placed the ult in front of me and I just go invisible.

3488
04:02:05,160 --> 04:02:05,740
So I don't have...

3489
04:02:05,740 --> 04:02:06,920
Because like when...

3490
04:02:06,920 --> 04:02:08,060
That's the thing that sucks.

3491
04:02:08,200 --> 04:02:16,220
When you're Luna and you ult and then the mag tries to ult you, you have to rely on your tanks to shield you.

3492
04:02:16,860 --> 04:02:21,340
But as invisible woman, I could just place my ult down and just disappear from the game.

3493
04:02:21,920 --> 04:02:23,080
And then that's it.

3494
04:02:23,480 --> 04:02:24,280
And then I live.

3495
04:02:27,600 --> 04:02:27,660
Oh

3496
04:02:32,300 --> 04:02:34,200
yeah, no.

3497
04:02:36,120 --> 04:02:37,080
Yeah, no.

3498
04:02:37,400 --> 04:02:38,140
Loki is so...

3499
04:02:38,900 --> 04:02:39,580
It's...

3500
04:02:39,580 --> 04:02:42,120
Loki is like not viable anymore.

3501
04:02:44,860 --> 04:02:45,560
Oh my god.

3502
04:02:45,640 --> 04:02:46,420
Luna jail.

3503
04:02:46,760 --> 04:02:48,220
Back into...

3504
04:02:48,220 --> 04:02:50,000
Back into Luna jail.

3505
04:02:51,780 --> 04:02:54,440
Demon Shark, thank you for the tier 1 sub.

3506
04:02:54,620 --> 04:02:55,320
Thank you.

3507
04:02:55,320 --> 04:02:57,660
No, he is high key bad.

3508
04:02:58,200 --> 04:03:01,920
He's only good in triple support in certain circumstances

3509
04:03:06,100 --> 04:03:07,900
He's like high-key bad.

3510
04:03:08,200 --> 04:03:19,680
I'd never see low-key players anymore except for low-key one tricks Those fuckers Those fuckers invading my game But there's like I don't even know like two of them.

3511
04:03:19,760 --> 04:03:23,480
I've only bumped into two low-key one tricks or one actually.

3512
04:03:23,520 --> 04:03:24,560
It's just one guy

3513
04:03:29,150 --> 04:03:30,550
Oh you love about Luna?

3514
04:03:31,270 --> 04:03:49,830
Oh Um, I used to like Luna a lot back then, because, like, back then, um, um, she was a lot more fun to play, and then, like, some, like, I guess, like, when they introduced Invisible Woman, her impact in the, like, game got, like, less and less.

3515
04:03:50,470 --> 04:03:54,070
I mean, she still has a high impact, but it's just more frustrating to play as her.

3516
04:03:56,110 --> 04:03:58,030
It's just more too frustrating to play here.

3517
04:03:58,430 --> 04:04:01,230
Because, like I said, I could do, like, so many things.

3518
04:04:01,430 --> 04:04:02,010
correct?

3519
04:04:02,450 --> 04:04:04,750
Like, look, I freeze him and everything.

3520
04:04:04,990 --> 04:04:06,350
Oh, he's still alive.

3521
04:04:07,470 --> 04:04:09,650
Oh, he still gets to live.

3522
04:04:10,050 --> 04:04:10,970
Oh, that sucks.

3523
04:04:12,250 --> 04:04:14,690
Oh, I guess he's alive.

3524
04:04:16,830 --> 04:04:20,750
Like, I hit that freeze and everything, but we let her live.

3525
04:04:22,190 --> 04:04:24,530
Oh, oh, I hit it again.

3526
04:04:28,490 --> 04:04:30,530
Why are you running away?

3527
04:04:30,650 --> 04:04:30,950
Okay.

3528
04:04:31,430 --> 04:04:37,530

04:04:40,030 --> 04:04:42,410

3532
04:04:42,570 --> 04:04:49,690

04:06:02,230 --> 04:06:05,870
I don't know if she said her first or me first, because I was waiting for her.

3538
04:06:06,950 --> 04:06:08,810
Yeah, we got Spider-Man's.

3539
04:06:16,420 --> 04:06:17,180

All right, here we go.

3543
04:06:31,650 --> 04:06:32,310
Here we go.

3544
04:06:32,490 --> 04:06:33,970
Oh my god, here I go!

3545
04:06:38,430 --> 04:06:40,810
All right, here we go.

3546
04:06:40,910 --> 04:06:44,470
I'm just alting this because I don't trust my team to be alive.

3547
04:06:44,990 --> 04:06:48,470
And then the Spider-Man is going to be like, you don't miss me Spider-Man.

3548
04:06:48,690 --> 04:06:49,130
Or this.

3549
04:06:57,480 --> 04:06:57,700
Oh.

3550
04:06:59,140 --> 04:07:00,120
There we go.

3551
04:07:01,580 --> 04:07:02,940
There we go.

3552
04:07:06,500 --> 04:07:07,000
All right.

Oh my god.

3557
04:07:21,840 --> 04:07:23,320
Are you fucking worse?

How many more freezes do I do?

3563
04:07:53,480 --> 04:07:55,020
I should have saved the collab.

3564
04:07:55,220 --> 04:07:57,620
I'm just, I'm not playing autopilot right now.

3565
04:07:58,080 --> 04:07:59,540
I should have saved it.

3566
04:08:00,460 --> 04:08:01,260
All right.

3567
04:08:01,740 --> 04:08:03,620
Oh, am I going to get another dive?

3568
04:08:04,200 --> 04:08:05,080

04:08:05,620 --> 04:08:06,600

It doesn't matter.

3577

It doesn't matter.

3578
04:08:18,780 --> 04:08:20,380
It is definitely not good.

3579
04:08:25,040 --> 04:08:26,040
Okay, there we go.

3580
04:08:27,460 --> 04:08:30,840
I told you, it doesn't matter how many times I freeze someone!

3581
04:08:32,100 --> 04:08:33,460

Oh, at least you all did.

04:11:49,300 --> 04:11:50,860
Oh my god.

3625
04:11:51,140 --> 04:11:51,520
Okay.

3626
04:11:51,700 --> 04:11:52,940
I had to use it.

3627
04:11:53,320 --> 04:11:53,960

3628
04:11:54,300 --> 04:11:55,500
I'm going here.

3629
04:11:56,040 --> 04:11:57,280
Hello everyone.

3630
04:11:58,120 --> 04:11:58,640
Hello.

3631
04:11:59,880 --> 04:12:01,420
Come on, let me go.

3632
04:12:01,680 --> 04:12:02,660
You get a weapon.

3633
04:12:02,880 --> 04:12:03,560
You get a weapon.

3634
04:12:03,820 --> 04:12:04,420
You get a weapon.

3635
04:12:04,780 --> 04:12:05,200
Okay.

3636
04:12:07,980 --> 04:12:10,220
Alright, I wanted, I was scared.

3637
04:12:10,800 --> 04:12:13,820
I ulted that because I was so scared.

3638
04:12:15,440 --> 04:12:25,360
i was so scared i was so you don't understand i was so scared i felt like i felt like if i didn't

3639
04:12:29,380 --> 04:13:16,490
oh my god this is not good for me i don't know if i should have just died there but like i felt like i felt like i felt like the me if I didn't oh that you were so I know I was like we're on the payload like I was like what like the moon me and the imps were on the payload how what like baby you're the one that's so far back

3640
04:13:24,110 --> 04:13:29,170
I'm tempted to just play Rocket, but I know my Invis will fucking die.

3641
04:13:32,790 --> 04:13:41,810
I can tell she would actually die if I don't play Luna.

3642
04:13:47,940 --> 04:13:48,620
Like,

3643
04:13:52,990 --> 04:13:55,470
I don't really want to play Luna, right?

3644
04:13:57,490 --> 04:14:21,890
I can I can tell Maybe I can give this to our spotted man And then run back There you go Because then Rocket is like Like you play Rocket so that they can't dive you They'll just dive the Invis But I know Like because I'm literally freezing him Nine out of ten times

3645
04:14:25,400 --> 04:14:31,240
Okay That's fine Oh I use my clap though, which is bad.

3646
04:14:32,120 --> 04:14:36,160
Like the moment I got hit, I used my clap because I got so scared.

3647
04:14:38,620 --> 04:14:40,660
Jesus Christ, I hate this.

3648
04:14:55,190 --> 04:14:56,470
Look at that.

3649
04:14:56,730 --> 04:14:57,050
Look at that.

3650
04:14:57,310 --> 04:14:57,570
I got it.

3651
04:14:57,570 --> 04:14:58,790
I got it against.

3652
04:15:00,890 --> 04:15:01,490
Look at that.

3653
04:15:01,670 --> 04:15:02,070
All right.

3654
04:15:04,770 --> 04:15:09,430
Literally, if I don't freeze him, it'd be like GG's.

3655
04:15:13,500 --> 04:15:16,240
Where did my, where did she go?

3656
04:15:16,700 --> 04:15:18,400
Where did she go?

3657
04:15:22,400 --> 04:15:27,860
I think, bro, I think their Spider-Man is better than my Spider-Man.

3658
04:15:29,120 --> 04:15:32,080
I honestly, I honestly do.

3659
04:15:32,360 --> 04:15:35,020
I don't think, I think their Spider-Man's better.

3660
04:15:36,320 --> 04:15:38,420
You need to stop that vehicle in its tracks.

3661
04:15:38,680 --> 04:15:41,660
Because it's like, I don't understand.

3662
04:15:41,680 --> 04:15:43,220
Oh, it's because they have venom.

3663
04:15:43,480 --> 04:15:44,300
It's, yeah, never mind.

3664
04:15:45,540 --> 04:15:47,860
We have Hulk, and we don't have a name for it.

3665
04:15:49,000 --> 04:15:49,540
Look at that.

3666
04:15:49,920 --> 04:15:51,400
Oh, there we go again.

3667
04:15:52,760 --> 04:15:54,060
There we go again.

3668
04:15:55,260 --> 04:15:56,140
Use my clap.

3669
04:16:04,040 --> 04:16:04,160
Oh.

3670
04:16:05,720 --> 04:16:06,560
There we go.

3671
04:16:14,620 --> 04:16:15,400
You're going to go.

3672
04:16:15,400 --> 04:16:16,020
I kept on something.

3673
04:16:16,220 --> 04:16:16,660
There's something.

3674
04:16:18,580 --> 04:16:21,560
Bro, can you just go Gamma?

3675
04:16:22,080 --> 04:16:22,620
I don't understand.

3676
04:16:24,880 --> 04:16:25,640
Why are you playing Phoenix?

3677
04:16:26,620 --> 04:16:27,740
What is Phoenix gonna do, bro?

3678
04:16:28,160 --> 04:16:29,740
You're not even killing the fucking Spider-Man.

3679
04:16:29,980 --> 04:16:30,600
Just go Gamma.

3680
04:16:32,940 --> 04:16:34,340
Oh, there you go!

3681
04:16:34,760 --> 04:16:35,900
There it is again!

3682
04:16:39,900 --> 04:16:41,600
Okay, sorry, I have to go over here.

3683
04:16:41,660 --> 04:16:42,500
I have to go here.

3684
04:16:42,560 --> 04:16:43,360
I have to go here.

3685
04:16:43,420 --> 04:16:43,960
I'm sorry.

3686
04:16:44,240 --> 04:16:45,140
If you die.

3687
04:16:45,520 --> 04:16:46,400
Oh, I'll die.

3688
04:16:46,520 --> 04:16:46,980
Don't worry.

3689
04:16:47,000 --> 04:16:53,840
It's gonna be me I can't I can't I'm sorry.

3690
04:16:54,020 --> 04:17:04,660
I'm sorry you're gonna you're bluff Like yeah, I can't do that there This is actual hell

3691
04:17:15,660 --> 04:17:20,740
Okay Like I can't do this here.

3692
04:17:21,100 --> 04:17:23,400
I know she'll have It'll be worse.

3693
04:17:23,580 --> 04:17:24,500
I was so close.

3694
04:17:24,920 --> 04:17:26,840
I was so close.

3695
04:17:27,400 --> 04:17:28,360
I like...

3696
04:17:28,360 --> 04:17:31,040
How many freezes do I have to...

3697
04:17:31,040 --> 04:17:32,240
Oh my... Like, I'm saying!

3698
04:17:32,760 --> 04:17:40,400
I'll put 100% more effort into this character to win a game versus Invis.

3699
04:17:40,720 --> 04:17:42,940
I literally can autopilot on Invis.

3700
04:17:47,620 --> 04:17:49,380
Oh my god.

3701
04:17:50,820 --> 04:17:51,940
It's terrible.

3702
04:17:52,500 --> 04:17:54,840
It truly is so...

3703
04:17:54,840 --> 04:17:56,080
I can't fucking hit him.

3704
04:17:56,160 --> 04:17:56,660
Good luck.

3705
04:17:57,480 --> 04:17:58,760
I can't hit him.

3706
04:18:00,180 --> 04:18:01,280
Here we go.

3707
04:18:02,360 --> 04:18:02,600
Here.

3708
04:18:03,020 --> 04:18:03,860
I did it.

3709
04:18:04,920 --> 04:18:05,900
I did it for us.

3710
04:18:10,290 --> 04:18:16,010
I can hit all my freezes, but it'll never matter.

3711
04:18:18,990 --> 04:18:19,850
Oh my god!

3712
04:18:20,130 --> 04:18:21,690
The one freeze I miss, it's over!

3713
04:18:26,270 --> 04:18:27,450
They double now.

3714
04:18:27,630 --> 04:18:28,370
They did it just double?

3715
04:18:30,390 --> 04:18:30,690
Uh, we.

3716
04:18:37,360 --> 04:18:38,440
I can feel it.

3717
04:18:39,160 --> 04:18:39,920
I can feel it.

3718
04:18:40,200 --> 04:18:44,340
I don't know if it's in the back of the tunnel.

3719
04:18:44,380 --> 04:18:44,600
I'm coming.

3720
04:18:47,300 --> 04:18:48,860
I can feel it.

3721
04:18:49,540 --> 04:18:51,880
I can feel the spider metal.

3722
04:18:55,220 --> 04:18:56,800
I'm so, I'm not.

3723
04:18:56,960 --> 04:19:19,900
i'm not happy this is why i stopped the luna surely a dps will help out with the dive right i was like the ones the one freeze i missed from the venom i was like it's over like we might as well be dead now i'm letting our invis heal because there's no reason i don't want to damage i'm just kidding with you guys right I'm not dead.

3724
04:19:20,060 --> 04:19:22,400
I only heal when I need to help our...

3725
04:19:22,400 --> 04:19:22,940
Oh, whoa!

3726
04:19:25,140 --> 04:19:25,660
Please.

3727
04:19:26,820 --> 04:19:27,920
Please, I used my clap.

3728
04:19:30,660 --> 04:19:31,180
Alright.

3729
04:19:32,980 --> 04:19:34,200
I don't have clap, it's over.

3730
04:19:35,260 --> 04:19:38,220
I'm trying to, like, let my Invis do the healing.

3731
04:19:40,320 --> 04:19:41,660
There you go.

3732
04:19:42,640 --> 04:19:43,500
Did you flake our Spider-Man?

3733
04:19:44,520 --> 04:19:45,540
I did.

3734
04:19:49,300 --> 04:19:50,460
I can heal you.

3735
04:19:58,660 --> 04:20:00,260
Trying to lift.

3736
04:20:02,740 --> 04:20:03,500
Whoa!

3737
04:20:03,900 --> 04:20:04,880
Here we go!

3738
04:20:05,860 --> 04:20:07,520
Here we go!

3739
04:20:09,300 --> 04:20:09,440
Oh.

3740
04:20:10,620 --> 04:20:12,560
Get over here, girl!

3741
04:20:15,020 --> 04:20:16,140
There we go.

3742
04:20:17,640 --> 04:20:20,240
All right, one last fight for the run.

3743
04:20:20,420 --> 04:20:23,500
I'll just heal that, heal that a little bit.

3744
04:20:23,500 --> 04:20:27,320
Why do I even try for pigs?

3745
04:20:28,780 --> 04:20:30,000
Jesus Christ.

3746
04:20:33,780 --> 04:20:35,780
Did he stop the TP or not?

3747
04:20:40,150 --> 04:20:41,850
I don't even know if he stopped it.

3748
04:20:42,230 --> 04:20:43,150
Nope, he's so dead.

3749
04:20:47,190 --> 04:20:47,810
Unless...

3750
04:20:47,810 --> 04:20:50,510
I know.

3751
04:20:51,870 --> 04:20:53,930
This just might be...

3752
04:20:54,630 --> 04:20:55,750
Oh my god.

3753
04:20:55,930 --> 04:20:57,350
Oh my god, he actually did it.

3754
04:20:57,670 --> 04:20:59,530
Oh my god, I'm so proud of her.

3755
04:20:59,930 --> 04:21:01,330
Oh my god, I'm full!

3756
04:21:02,970 --> 04:21:03,830
That's okay.

3757
04:21:09,160 --> 04:21:09,700
Hoolies.

3758
04:21:10,360 --> 04:21:11,020
Give me it.

3759
04:21:12,520 --> 04:21:13,920
Oh my god, I missed it.

3760
04:21:14,220 --> 04:21:14,920
Oh, it's too late.

3761
04:21:15,420 --> 04:21:16,460
Okay, cheat.

3762
04:21:16,740 --> 04:21:17,360
Thank god.

3763
04:21:18,100 --> 04:21:18,600
It's over.

3764
04:21:19,680 --> 04:21:20,740
It's over.

3765
04:21:24,040 --> 04:21:25,480
It's taking over.

3766
04:21:27,300 --> 04:21:29,680
It's actually over.

3767
04:21:30,440 --> 04:21:33,020
I let me out of this game.

3768
04:21:33,860 --> 04:21:35,300
Let me get out of it.

3769
04:21:36,140 --> 04:21:36,720
Freedom.

3770
04:21:38,620 --> 04:21:40,120
Freedom from hell.

3771
04:21:42,560 --> 04:21:43,420
Holy fuck.

3772
04:21:47,600 --> 04:21:49,080
Oh my god.

3773
04:21:50,060 --> 04:21:53,580
I felt like I hated that game.

3774
04:21:54,200 --> 04:21:56,980
I hated that game so much.

3775
04:21:57,220 --> 04:21:59,320
I can rest now.

3776
04:22:02,200 --> 04:22:29,240
I think I missed like I missed three freezes out of like I don't know a hundred that I had to do yeah no I'm back to GM I was I was like two games away from losing it anyway yeah one more yeah I told you you'll be like in this I'm like la la la la she

3777
04:22:35,100 --> 04:23:58,330
I remember my other Luna did not during the last game um she did not freeze the fucking uh venom as much as I fucking just did I'm just like Jesus fucking Christ I do not want to deal with that shit no Spider-Man yeah it has 11k damage but that's Spider-Man like Spider-Man all you don't need a lot of uh damage to get kills because you know they're not farming damage you're literally there to do combos and stuff no i just want to play until i'm tired because i already set my sleep schedule i'm trying to stay up the whole day today um because like i don't want to because like i'm gonna be like way too awake um if i try to sleep like uh because i'm too awake now so i'm to i'm trying trying to like stay up the whole day because i fucked up my sleep schedule because of this stupid game yeah bro no but fuck that game bro this is why i hate playing luna now like It's like that's insane.

3778
04:23:58,530 --> 04:24:23,450

Now I just have to be like, oh there, oh, okay, we have...

3780
04:24:35,950 --> 04:24:37,990
We have three support players.

3781
04:24:38,550 --> 04:24:39,630
Let's hope these two can take.

3782
04:24:45,260 --> 04:24:47,160
Yeah, now I have to...

3783
04:24:47,160 --> 04:24:51,380
Yeah, and then Invis, I can play half the concentration.

3784
04:24:52,200 --> 04:24:56,040
Like, try half as hard on Invis and then get the same result.

3785
04:25:01,610 --> 04:25:03,290
That's all I want in life.

3786
04:25:03,910 --> 04:25:18,240
hands if only if only i get that if only that were true i don't get that privilege anymore

3787
04:25:30,270 --> 04:25:38,810
bottom all right i don't know about this scheme i don't know this game already seems a little rough

3788
04:25:43,390 --> 04:25:44,530
Oh, yeah.

3789
04:25:46,650 --> 04:25:47,070

04:25:48,910 --> 04:25:50,450
Ah, that's alright.

3791
04:25:51,170 --> 04:25:52,030
This that we have.

3792
04:25:54,690 --> 04:25:55,650
The Angela.

3793
04:25:56,570 --> 04:25:56,890
Hmm.

3794
04:25:57,430 --> 04:25:59,110
I don't want cloak, Jeff.

3795
04:25:59,290 --> 04:26:00,170
Uh, let's fuck it.

3796
04:26:00,190 --> 04:26:00,630
Let's try it.

3797
04:26:00,690 --> 04:26:01,030
Burn this.

3798
04:26:01,270 --> 04:26:01,730
That doesn't work.

3799
04:26:01,830 --> 04:26:02,310
I'll go Invis.

3800
04:26:03,390 --> 04:26:04,250
I really don't want to play Luna.

3801
04:26:04,850 --> 04:26:07,310
I really, really don't want to play Luna.

3802
04:26:07,650 --> 04:26:09,250
I want to... I need a break.

3803
04:26:09,490 --> 04:26:11,310
I need a break.

3804
04:26:12,470 --> 04:26:12,950
I...

3805
04:26:13,170 --> 04:26:14,170
I can't.

3806
04:26:15,790 --> 04:26:24,010
Oh yeah, no, the upcoming changes I heard with Daredevil and Venom is going to be a lot worse for supports with that.

3807
04:26:24,370 --> 04:26:29,710
Because it's just so intrusive.

3808
04:26:30,950 --> 04:26:32,750
But you have already proven your worth.

3809
04:26:33,530 --> 04:26:34,850
If this battle is to be won.

3810
04:26:34,930 --> 04:26:38,970
No, in this, you know, good Angela is like so scary.

3811
04:26:39,110 --> 04:26:40,650
But like, no, I shouldn't shake it.

3812
04:26:41,010 --> 04:26:41,970
I just play Invis.

3813
04:26:43,170 --> 04:26:45,050
many good Angeles just because I play Invis.

3814
04:26:45,730 --> 04:26:49,190
Like, literally, I just go push, and then they can't do shit.

3815
04:26:50,410 --> 04:26:56,210
Then we get, like, one one to two grabs, and then I go Invis, and then they get nothing and swap off.

3816
04:26:56,770 --> 04:26:57,330
It's great.

3817
04:26:57,670 --> 04:27:02,530
It makes me so happy knowing that I made them have an extra bad day in ring.

3818
04:27:04,870 --> 04:27:06,990
Just because I take a counter.

3819
04:27:08,270 --> 04:27:09,870
Alright, let's see what they're playing.

3820
04:27:11,870 --> 04:27:13,070
Oh, where did he go?

3821
04:27:19,310 --> 04:27:24,490
Jesus Christ Oh, he was diamond for him That's my bet

3822
04:27:27,860 --> 04:27:49,240
Okay, nice Whoa Not nice Oh my god, it's just dive I think I have to swap I need a swap We actually don't have enough heals right now I know it's crazy because we're on triple support, but they're hard diving us.

3823
04:27:49,340 --> 04:27:50,500
Why don't we swap our starlord?

3824
04:27:54,700 --> 04:27:56,260
I just don't have a good feeling about it.

3825
04:27:59,080 --> 04:28:00,740
Yeah, no, this...

3826
04:28:00,740 --> 04:28:01,720
I may have...

3827
04:28:01,720 --> 04:28:03,920
Oh, Rixie!

3828
04:28:04,180 --> 04:28:04,500
My fault.

3829
04:28:04,660 --> 04:28:05,040
No, you're right.

3830
04:28:06,240 --> 04:28:06,680
Rixie!

3831
04:28:07,360 --> 04:28:08,240
My fault.

3832
04:28:08,660 --> 04:28:09,360
You're right.

3833
04:28:12,220 --> 04:28:13,060
Are we all here?

3834
04:28:13,860 --> 04:28:14,260
Are we all here?

3835
04:28:14,320 --> 04:28:14,640
Let's go.

3836
04:28:16,300 --> 04:28:16,940
Damn.

3837
04:28:17,820 --> 04:28:18,500
Alright, goodbye.

3838
04:28:21,760 --> 04:28:23,060
Where am I?

3839
04:28:24,240 --> 04:28:25,280
Oh my god.

3840
04:28:25,760 --> 04:28:26,320
Where am I?

3841
04:28:26,680 --> 04:28:26,880
Where?

3842
04:28:27,460 --> 04:28:27,640
Where?

3843
04:28:29,140 --> 04:28:32,340
I'm just like, what's going on?

3844
04:28:40,950 --> 04:28:42,930
Oh my god, he's so fucked.

3845
04:28:44,870 --> 04:28:46,990
Oh my god, I'm trying my best.

3846
04:28:53,630 --> 04:28:55,810
I got so many headshots.

3847
04:28:56,110 --> 04:28:56,330
Yeah.

3848
04:28:57,670 --> 04:28:58,530
What is going?

3849
04:28:58,710 --> 04:29:01,130
God, I'm not playing this character.

3850
04:29:01,930 --> 04:29:05,470
Oh my god, Jeff is a controller player.

3851
04:29:10,290 --> 04:29:11,150
Oh, one HP.

3852
04:29:12,170 --> 04:29:12,810
That's okay.

3853
04:29:12,930 --> 04:29:14,490
We're all here.

3854
04:29:23,700 --> 04:29:24,460
Is he okay?

3855
04:29:25,140 --> 04:29:26,440
I don't think so.

3856
04:29:26,820 --> 04:29:28,340
Maybe I can push him off.

3857
04:29:30,880 --> 04:29:31,880
Guys, please.

3858
04:29:32,600 --> 04:29:34,320
Guys, I don't have enough.

3859
04:29:34,480 --> 04:29:35,240
Oh, thank God.

3860
04:29:35,400 --> 04:29:36,640
Thank God.

3861
04:29:37,300 --> 04:29:37,860
Guys, please.

3862
04:29:39,740 --> 04:29:40,900
I don't have...

3863
04:29:40,900 --> 04:29:41,480
Thank God.

3864
04:29:46,160 --> 04:29:47,920
God, I'll kill that.

3865
04:29:48,180 --> 04:29:49,400
We just had...

3866
04:29:53,340 --> 04:29:54,580
Oh, God.

3867
04:29:54,920 --> 04:29:56,000
There's so much damage.

3868
04:29:56,740 --> 04:29:58,520
There's so much damage.

3869
04:29:59,380 --> 04:30:00,780
Oh, my God.

3870
04:30:01,660 --> 04:30:04,100
There's so much damage.

3871
04:30:04,340 --> 04:30:05,400
Holy fuck.

3872
04:30:05,640 --> 04:30:06,780
What do we...

3873
04:30:06,860 --> 04:30:07,440
Dude...

3874
04:30:07,440 --> 04:30:08,260
No, one would...

3875
04:30:08,260 --> 04:30:08,820
One HP.

3876
04:30:13,830 --> 04:30:14,550
Nice.

3877
04:30:20,610 --> 04:30:22,530
That's okay, we'll be on this point.

3878
04:30:23,090 --> 04:30:23,650
It's fine.

3879
04:30:24,490 --> 04:30:25,370
It's fine.

3880
04:30:25,730 --> 04:30:28,610
I- I- I- What- what's going on?

3881
04:30:30,850 --> 04:30:31,370
Please!

3882
04:30:33,710 --> 04:30:35,330
What the fuck?

3883
04:30:36,230 --> 04:30:39,810
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3884
04:30:40,170 --> 04:30:42,090
Okay, okay, we're okay.

3885
04:30:42,630 --> 04:30:43,010
We're okay.

3886
04:30:43,130 --> 04:30:44,890
We live for another day.

3887
04:30:45,290 --> 04:30:49,350
We live for another day.

3888
04:30:49,910 --> 04:30:50,850
I, I, okay.

3889
04:30:52,110 --> 04:30:52,970
Okay.

3890
04:30:55,290 --> 04:30:58,310
That was crazy.

3891
04:31:01,530 --> 04:31:02,490
Oh my god.

3892
04:31:02,950 --> 04:31:03,390
Why?

3893
04:31:03,770 --> 04:31:05,050
Out of everyone.

3894
04:31:06,190 --> 04:31:08,410
I'm so scared.

3895
04:31:10,530 --> 04:31:14,510
Oh, shit.

3896
04:31:15,930 --> 04:31:16,730
Oh, shit.

3897
04:31:18,750 --> 04:31:19,170
Goodbye.

3898
04:31:19,470 --> 04:31:19,990
Use my jump.

3899
04:31:20,190 --> 04:31:20,770
It's over for me.

3900
04:31:20,850 --> 04:31:21,610
Three, two.

3901
04:31:22,150 --> 04:31:22,490
No!

3902
04:31:22,870 --> 04:31:25,350
I just need one more second.

3903
04:31:26,310 --> 04:31:27,330
Oh, my God.

3904
04:31:30,550 --> 04:31:34,170
Have I had my jump for one more second?

3905
04:31:35,930 --> 04:31:37,250
That's so unlucky.

3906
04:31:37,570 --> 04:31:39,030
We'll have to keep fighting until we have a winner.

3907
04:31:39,030 --> 04:31:49,710
tp or oh no one's off go

3908
04:31:53,100 --> 04:32:24,020
go oh i almost ran in oh wait doesn't dokey play dps what no wait did i it feels good to step outside my bubble every now and then Maybe like the main DPS for all Bro I've been playing support and rivals for too long to swap back to to try DPS Not in this ELO.

3909
04:32:24,120 --> 04:32:28,800
I'm fucking playing DPS with this ELO Maybe in the lower ELO's bro.

3910
04:32:29,000 --> 04:32:35,500
Fuck that shit Location but with the best silo can I don't know T is in the wrong time

3911
04:32:40,000 --> 04:33:08,740
But I knew what it was gonna be like play mag here or probably okay but sure would have been nice to have you back on board the milana the battle starts in five four three two one no you gotta be like super high to get rid of jeff the jeff jump up but even then like the timing is like really hard because you just go invisible and just fucking book it

3912
04:33:12,420 --> 04:33:16,660
I don't know I don't know what it is that if maybe a lab would have changed anything

3913
04:33:22,100 --> 04:33:31,640
Okay All right

3914
04:33:37,060 --> 04:33:39,480
All right, he's so far from us.

3915
04:33:40,100 --> 04:33:41,280
He's so far from us now

3916
04:33:44,820 --> 04:33:49,680
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh The map change!

3917
04:33:51,160 --> 04:33:51,720
The

3918
04:33:55,490 --> 04:33:57,030
map change is crazy.

3919
04:33:59,830 --> 04:34:00,950
Jesus Christ.

3920
04:34:01,250 --> 04:34:02,430
Oh my, there's nothing.

3921
04:34:03,070 --> 04:34:04,370
I just got my luck.

3922
04:34:05,590 --> 04:34:07,030
I just got it.

3923
04:34:12,810 --> 04:34:14,050
Oh, thanks.

3924
04:34:16,090 --> 04:34:16,210
Oh.

3925
04:34:17,670 --> 04:34:18,890
Okay, the Hulk is on the plate there.

3926
04:34:20,830 --> 04:34:21,770
Alright, here we go.

3927
04:34:22,350 --> 04:34:23,370
I had the whole fight.

3928
04:34:23,650 --> 04:34:25,250
Jesus, it's so disordained.

3929
04:34:25,390 --> 04:34:26,590
I didn't even realize that's my bad.

3930
04:34:27,750 --> 04:34:28,250
Jesus Christ.

3931
04:34:28,590 --> 04:34:29,510
That was my bad.

3932
04:34:29,730 --> 04:34:30,630
I might throw an F-client.

3933
04:34:30,930 --> 04:34:32,450
I thought, like, I didn't have my...

3934
04:34:32,450 --> 04:34:36,270
To be fair, it was a lot going on.

3935
04:34:37,230 --> 04:34:38,450
To be fair.

3936
04:34:40,670 --> 04:34:42,450
It was a lot.

3937
04:34:43,210 --> 04:34:44,290
It really...

3938
04:34:44,990 --> 04:34:48,690
It really was so much going on there.

3939
04:34:49,370 --> 04:34:49,850
That's...

3940
04:34:50,810 --> 04:34:51,690
No worries.

3941
04:34:51,990 --> 04:34:52,550
I've got your back.

3942
04:34:57,770 --> 04:35:00,230
It was crazy.

3943
04:35:02,650 --> 04:35:04,490
I want to hurt all at first.

3944
04:35:05,030 --> 04:35:08,230
I'll be like, you all at first.

3945
04:35:10,510 --> 04:35:10,950
All right.

3946
04:35:15,590 --> 04:35:16,790
Maybe she'll do it.

3947
04:35:17,890 --> 04:35:22,390
I ran out of shields first only because, like, I'm so scared, you know?

3948
04:35:24,310 --> 04:35:25,690
It seems me.

3949
04:35:43,180 --> 04:35:46,780
Okay, maybe I should have ults at first.

3950
04:35:55,500 --> 04:35:57,000
I got to...

3951
04:35:57,000 --> 04:35:58,520
There's nothing to do to save me.

3952
04:35:59,360 --> 04:36:01,920
I actually was unsavable.

3953
04:36:03,480 --> 04:36:03,480
There

3954
04:36:06,670 --> 04:36:10,770
you go.

3955
04:36:11,050 --> 04:36:15,050
There you go.

3956
04:36:17,570 --> 04:36:19,050
Alright, let's use this.

3957
04:36:19,270 --> 04:36:19,930
I'll push up.

3958
04:36:20,450 --> 04:36:21,170
Goodbye, everyone.

3959
04:36:21,590 --> 04:36:22,170
Oh, nice.

3960
04:36:24,790 --> 04:36:25,230
Alright.

3961
04:36:28,070 --> 04:36:29,470
Oh, goodbye, everyone.

3962
04:36:37,190 --> 04:36:38,130
It's okay.

3963
04:36:39,590 --> 04:36:40,150
It's okay.

3964
04:36:40,830 --> 04:36:42,190
Sometimes life do be like that.

3965
04:36:43,770 --> 04:36:44,390
Oh my god.

3966
04:36:44,650 --> 04:36:45,730
I don't want to play.

3967
04:36:46,430 --> 04:36:48,410
I don't want to play Luna.

3968
04:36:49,110 --> 04:36:50,790
Don't make me play Luna.

3969
04:36:51,490 --> 04:36:52,190
That's it.

3970
04:36:52,230 --> 04:36:53,970
I refuse to play Luna.

3971
04:36:55,390 --> 04:36:56,410
You have two people.

3972
04:36:56,710 --> 04:36:57,390
You have two people.

3973
04:36:58,370 --> 04:36:59,250
Did you love it?

3974
04:37:01,030 --> 04:37:03,030
Oh, we're doing our...

3975
04:37:07,830 --> 04:38:02,650
I'm sorry I'm sorry wait I got an idea it's time it's time they won't load they won't load they won't know they won't know they won't know they don't see it they saw it they saw it oh this is bad they saw it they saw my wrist I thought it was so in it I I really die I hit it so well you know oh this is bad this is so bad this is so bad I'm trying my best to keep it up I'm trying so hard oh my god oh my god oh come on come on come on come

3976
04:38:06,630 --> 04:38:07,130
I got it.

3977
04:38:07,230 --> 04:38:07,710
I got it.

3978
04:38:07,710 --> 04:38:08,190
I got it.

3979
04:38:16,140 --> 04:38:16,680
I got it.

3980
04:38:17,340 --> 04:38:18,160
I got... No!

3981
04:38:24,870 --> 04:38:25,650
Oh my god.

3982
04:38:25,770 --> 04:38:25,950
I'm dead.

3983
04:38:26,090 --> 04:38:26,410
I'm dead.

3984
04:38:27,070 --> 04:38:27,470
Oh my god.

3985
04:38:27,630 --> 04:38:28,710
I can't do anything about it.

3986
04:38:29,470 --> 04:38:30,830
I climbed so much.

3987
04:38:32,950 --> 04:38:34,410
All I did...

3988
04:38:34,410 --> 04:38:36,970
All I did was I just kept...

3989
04:38:36,970 --> 04:38:38,390
I just kept climbing.

3990
04:38:39,050 --> 04:38:41,350
I kept climbing and I kept climbing.

3991
04:38:41,830 --> 04:38:43,950
When do I stop climbing?

3992
04:38:44,550 --> 04:38:45,390
That's over here.

3993
04:38:49,170 --> 04:38:52,250
All I did was climb.

3994
04:38:54,230 --> 04:38:54,990
GG.

3995
04:38:56,230 --> 04:39:00,590
I kept climbing.

3996
04:39:02,050 --> 04:39:04,070
Well, you can't expect to win them all.

3997
04:39:05,950 --> 04:39:07,910
Barry, get it off.

3998
04:39:13,570 --> 04:39:14,330
Damn.

3999
04:39:15,250 --> 04:39:16,550
Is she a cloak one trick?

4000
04:39:16,570 --> 04:39:25,810
she wasn't that doing that bad it's just cloak is just so bad it's just cloak is just bad

4001
04:39:29,890 --> 04:39:42,130
not like uh not a good character to play at all i'm there's no objective i'm just doom queuing at this point i've like reached my objective i'm

4002
04:39:48,610 --> 04:39:50,090
I've reached it.

4003
04:39:51,550 --> 04:39:52,610
How bad did they nerf Cloak?

4004
04:39:52,750 --> 04:39:53,830
She's just not meta.

4005
04:39:54,190 --> 04:39:54,850
That's it.

4006
04:39:55,210 --> 04:39:57,590
She's so easily counterable by Mag.

4007
04:39:57,730 --> 04:40:02,050
Because Mag is a hard meta pick for Tank.

4008
04:40:04,650 --> 04:40:05,690
So, um...

4009
04:40:05,690 --> 04:40:08,890
So, like, there's no reason to play Cloak.

4010
04:40:09,190 --> 04:40:10,910
Because there's just so many counters to her.

4011
04:40:11,510 --> 04:40:15,890
And a good DPS player will just hook you off of your Cloak alt and delete you.

4012
04:40:16,530 --> 04:40:18,290
Yeah, Mag is just too good of a Tank.

4013
04:40:18,610 --> 04:40:24,290
It's just almost like almost all tank players will know how to play mag in the silo.

4014
04:40:24,810 --> 04:40:25,510
So like there's no point.

4015
04:40:27,930 --> 04:40:33,850
Um, and like literally the best support comp is triple support and cloak is not in triple support.

4016
04:40:34,070 --> 04:40:36,730
Like triple support is the best support comp.

4017
04:40:37,330 --> 04:40:41,270
But like if you play cloak people angie, including me because we're in triple support.

4018
04:40:41,450 --> 04:40:42,330
I was angie.

4019
04:40:42,650 --> 04:40:45,250
I was, you know, I should actually avoid her.

4020
04:40:46,470 --> 04:40:48,590
I'm like, because like.

4021
04:40:48,610 --> 04:41:07,950
If she was anything else If she was Invis Or Luna Or Mantis It would have worked But she was cloak So it didn't work

4022
04:41:11,970 --> 04:41:43,190
Yeah Now the reason why I didn't stay high ground was because The The sidewalk was following me So I had to move around I had to fucking run around the point Because the siloac was hunting me down So I was just like I had to get back I had to just run around And then I got scared Because I still had to heal the Hulk So I was like Oh no Hulk Guess I'll die with you

4023
04:41:47,240 --> 04:41:48,400
Bye Hulk

4024
04:41:52,240 --> 04:41:55,900
Because the Hulk and I were contesting the point for so long.

4025
04:41:59,900 --> 04:42:01,960
I was like, I swear this is my last time.

4026
04:42:02,020 --> 04:42:02,880
I'm not grinding anymore.

4027
04:42:03,020 --> 04:42:03,500
I'm doom queuing.

4028
04:42:03,640 --> 04:42:04,060
I lost.

4029
04:42:06,200 --> 04:42:06,800
But yeah.

4030
04:42:07,500 --> 04:42:10,580
I'm not even trying anymore.

4031
04:42:10,880 --> 04:42:12,160
I'm just doom queuing.

4032
04:42:12,280 --> 04:42:14,800
I've accepted that I can't make it this season.

4033
04:42:15,500 --> 04:42:16,660
There's two days left.

4034
04:42:17,080 --> 04:42:18,340
Wait, I avoided.

4035
04:42:23,180 --> 04:42:23,700
Oh.

4036
04:42:23,900 --> 04:42:25,920
Oh, I forgot to ask him to re-queue.

4037
04:42:26,100 --> 04:42:27,760
I forgot to ask for the re-queue.

4038
04:42:28,720 --> 04:42:30,140
I was like, wait a minute.

4039
04:42:31,120 --> 04:42:32,200
All right, we have...

4040
04:42:32,200 --> 04:42:34,180
Okay, we have Mantis Cloak.

4041
04:42:34,700 --> 04:42:35,040
Fuck!

4042
04:42:38,080 --> 04:42:38,500
Okay.

4043
04:42:39,320 --> 04:42:41,640
All right, I forgot to ask for a re-queue.

4044
04:42:45,220 --> 04:42:47,620
Because I just don't want to cook on my team.

4045
04:42:48,920 --> 04:42:52,480
No, if you avoid someone, you have to re-queue it to implement.

4046
04:42:53,900 --> 04:42:55,160
If I could, I would.

4047
04:42:56,320 --> 04:42:57,320
Uh, my ma.

4048
04:42:58,900 --> 04:42:59,860
No, she is.

4049
04:43:00,260 --> 04:43:00,740
100%.

4050
04:43:00,740 --> 04:43:02,140
Because she's stuck with Cloak.

4051
04:43:02,360 --> 04:43:03,040
No matter what.

4052
04:43:03,620 --> 04:43:04,500
Because it's not meta.

4053
04:43:04,640 --> 04:43:07,560
But she's so easy to climb for those who can't game.

4054
04:43:07,620 --> 04:43:09,320
Because she's just game sense.

4055
04:43:11,360 --> 04:43:13,260
She's just literally game sense.

4056
04:43:13,680 --> 04:43:14,160
That's it.

4057
04:43:14,540 --> 04:43:15,360
But like, one trick.

4058
04:43:16,240 --> 04:43:17,640
Ignore the part where.

4059
04:43:18,400 --> 04:43:20,380
You have to swap off Cloak when it's not working.

4060
04:43:20,800 --> 04:43:22,140
That's the only thing that's wrong.

4061
04:43:24,300 --> 04:43:25,260
It's like rock.

4062
04:43:25,460 --> 04:43:28,660
The thing is, it's like, it's crazy.

4063
04:43:28,760 --> 04:43:32,320
I feel like for supports, there's only three one trick.

4064
04:43:32,420 --> 04:43:33,480
There's only two one tricks.

4065
04:43:35,180 --> 04:43:36,120
Cloak and Rocket.

4066
04:43:36,700 --> 04:43:39,400
And they're both characters that don't really require aim.

4067
04:43:40,320 --> 04:43:45,080
And if you, if they put on like any other character, they're like handless.

4068
04:43:45,620 --> 04:43:51,640
But like, if you have like a Luna main or an invisible woman main, they can easily play any other characters.

4069
04:43:53,900 --> 04:44:53,820
like we we they're cool they're cool now they're cool now um but if you literally put them off of their one tricks um they like they're just handless that's why i'm so i i i personally just hate cook one tricks and rocket one because they're so easily counterable but every other support player like if you put the Luna one trick I'm playing Adam because this is meta um you put Mantis Adam is really good I would play Ultron but we have a cloak and I do not want to play Ultron with known snowflake but you literally put you put Luna one trick on any other support she's okay she can play any other character decently if you put like an Invis or a Mantis they're all they're fine they can play any other support easily it's just it's literally cloaking rocket there are the problems Four,

4070
04:44:54,060 --> 04:44:56,360
three, two, one.

4071
04:44:56,380 --> 04:44:57,200
It's gonna slay.

4072
04:45:02,740 --> 04:45:05,240
Oh no, not hope.

4073
04:45:08,100 --> 04:45:08,160
Okay.

4074
04:45:10,480 --> 04:45:11,300
Okay.

4075
04:45:13,320 --> 04:45:16,380
I'm going down.

4076
04:45:16,880 --> 04:45:17,600
Oh shit!

4077
04:45:18,580 --> 04:45:19,560
I dropped down.

4078
04:45:21,090 --> 04:45:22,940
I'm running hooks all over here.

4079
04:45:23,880 --> 04:45:24,780
All right.

4080
04:45:25,540 --> 04:45:27,200
Hope that's okay.

4081
04:45:29,540 --> 04:45:30,400
All right.

4082
04:45:30,640 --> 04:45:31,340
I didn't want to use...

4083
04:45:36,220 --> 04:45:36,940
Okay.

4084
04:45:37,840 --> 04:45:38,480
Watch out of my lock.

4085
04:45:39,560 --> 04:45:40,620
There you go.

4086
04:45:40,820 --> 04:45:41,380
You're five.

4087
04:45:41,740 --> 04:45:42,880
You're so healthy.

4088
04:45:46,500 --> 04:45:47,700
You're five.

4089
04:45:49,340 --> 04:45:50,800
It's not you ping, though.

4090
04:45:52,540 --> 04:45:54,220
I'm not using my...

4091
04:45:54,900 --> 04:45:55,540
I'm not using my...

4092
04:45:56,220 --> 04:45:57,020
My shift?

4093
04:45:57,440 --> 04:45:58,560
Because there's no use.

4094
04:46:00,080 --> 04:46:01,260
Oh, at least they have a rocket.

4095
04:46:02,140 --> 04:46:02,840
You know?

4096
04:46:05,980 --> 04:46:08,560
At least they have a rocket.

4097
04:46:08,740 --> 04:46:09,840
A rocket...

4098
04:46:09,840 --> 04:46:13,420
I would say a rocket is better than the cloak at this point.

4099
04:46:14,300 --> 04:46:15,240
Like, right now.

4100
04:46:16,160 --> 04:46:16,760
There we go.

4101
04:46:17,600 --> 04:46:18,600
You're fine.

4102
04:46:19,120 --> 04:46:19,820
Don't worry.

4103
04:46:20,820 --> 04:46:22,760
This is why I saved my...

4104
04:46:22,760 --> 04:46:23,540
My thing.

4105
04:46:23,780 --> 04:46:24,300
Oh.

4106
04:46:29,220 --> 04:46:30,100
Oh, that sucks.

4107
04:46:30,380 --> 04:46:33,080
I mean, I have res, but I'm not res in here.

4108
04:46:34,100 --> 04:46:35,220
But I would say...

4109
04:46:37,460 --> 04:46:37,920
Oh.

4110
04:46:39,080 --> 04:46:39,800
Oh, no.

4111
04:46:39,880 --> 04:46:40,720
Now they have a venom.

4112
04:46:40,960 --> 04:46:41,160
God.

4113
04:46:42,480 --> 04:46:43,600
I'll play for res.

4114
04:46:47,360 --> 04:46:49,280
I gotta pay for res now.

4115
04:46:51,680 --> 04:46:52,160
Oh.

4116
04:46:53,520 --> 04:46:55,200
I guess now?

4117
04:46:58,160 --> 04:46:58,640
Okay.

4118
04:46:59,220 --> 04:47:00,040
Alright, here we go.

4119
04:47:01,080 --> 04:47:01,680
Let's go.

4120
04:47:02,460 --> 04:47:03,100
We run.

4121
04:47:06,020 --> 04:47:07,760
Oh, fuck, I fucked up.

4122
04:47:08,600 --> 04:47:09,700
That was too fast.

4123
04:47:12,280 --> 04:47:14,280
It's fine, I have ships.

4124
04:47:14,940 --> 04:47:17,240
We should really go push up though, where...

4125
04:47:17,240 --> 04:47:18,960
I am ready to put on a show.

4126
04:47:20,540 --> 04:47:21,100
Fuck it.

4127
04:47:21,380 --> 04:47:21,820
There we go.

4128
04:47:21,880 --> 04:47:23,100
We have to use this.

4129
04:47:26,640 --> 04:47:28,540
The only issue now?

4130
04:47:29,100 --> 04:47:31,540
Okay, yeah, that's the only issue now.

4131
04:47:36,220 --> 04:47:37,300
There we go.

4132
04:47:38,500 --> 04:47:39,560
There we go.

4133
04:47:46,460 --> 04:47:46,980
Hello.

4134
04:47:54,590 --> 04:47:56,910
Oh, whoops, sorry, I didn't think she would hit that sleeve, you know?

4135
04:48:00,650 --> 04:48:03,270
Oh, I didn't think we would die there.

4136
04:48:03,910 --> 04:48:04,210
Oh,

4137
04:48:09,030 --> 04:48:10,430
we can't contest.

4138
04:48:10,890 --> 04:48:11,350
That sucks.

4139
04:48:12,170 --> 04:48:13,050
I don't think we can contest.

4140
04:48:13,390 --> 04:48:14,230
I thought it'd shift.

4141
04:48:14,850 --> 04:48:16,010
Ah, no.

4142
04:48:22,200 --> 04:48:23,160
That sucks.

4143
04:48:24,140 --> 04:48:25,500
Wait, did we ban Jeff?

4144
04:48:25,560 --> 04:48:26,860
We banned Jeff doing...

4145
04:48:28,820 --> 04:48:30,800
I think we banned Jeff, right?

4146
04:48:30,980 --> 04:48:32,400
I think I'll just go in this.

4147
04:48:32,680 --> 04:48:33,360
They have too many.

4148
04:48:34,360 --> 04:48:35,820
Ah, fuck.

4149
04:48:36,840 --> 04:48:37,760
That sucks.

4150
04:48:38,280 --> 04:48:39,360
Ah, I'll swap.

4151
04:48:39,860 --> 04:48:41,500
Mmm, actually.

4152
04:48:42,920 --> 04:48:43,280
Mmm.

4153
04:48:47,060 --> 04:48:48,080
Destiny awaits.

4154
04:48:48,100 --> 04:48:49,100
They've made it halfway.

4155
04:48:49,540 --> 04:48:50,200
Stop them!

4156
04:48:51,880 --> 04:48:53,180
Oh, okay.

4157
04:48:53,560 --> 04:48:55,420
If they cap the second point, I'll swap.

4158
04:48:56,620 --> 04:49:00,320
Because I don't think it's viable now.

4159
04:49:00,920 --> 04:49:03,320
Not this point, part of the point.

4160
04:49:05,300 --> 04:49:07,580
Alright, I hope they...

4161
04:49:09,800 --> 04:49:10,900
Hey guys!

4162
04:49:11,160 --> 04:49:12,400
Oh my god, okay, fine.

4163
04:49:13,860 --> 04:49:13,860
Fine.

4164
04:49:14,460 --> 04:49:15,580
I hope they...

4165
04:49:16,400 --> 04:49:18,860
Okay, we triple support all of it.

4166
04:49:19,460 --> 04:49:21,980
We triple support all of it.

4167
04:49:22,760 --> 04:49:22,920
Okay.

4168
04:49:26,140 --> 04:49:27,220
That sucks.

4169
04:49:33,820 --> 04:49:35,020
That sucks.

4170
04:49:35,180 --> 04:49:36,760
I can't believe we triple support.

That's why I was like, oh, I should have avoided.

4173
04:50:13,300 --> 04:50:16,320
I should have avoided.

4174
04:50:18,320 --> 04:50:21,560
No matter what, it's Mantis first for that.

4175
04:50:22,320 --> 04:50:23,560
Are you okay there, Mantis?

4176
04:50:29,040 --> 04:50:29,420

04:56:10,860 --> 04:56:16,910
the queue i had that gut feeling that she was she was gonna ruin it

4242
04:56:20,750 --> 04:56:23,240

We are not using Mantis Alt aggressively at all.

4246
04:56:44,170 --> 04:56:46,590
I think that's also the problem.

4247

Like.

4248
04:56:51,810 --> 04:56:52,370

05:06:25,380 --> 05:06:26,140
I'm not...

4338
05:06:27,500 --> 05:06:29,700
I'm just thinking what time to walk dad.

4339
05:06:30,320 --> 05:06:30,840
My dog.

4340
05:06:31,000 --> 05:06:32,980
My dog's name is Joki Amberdosh.

4341
05:06:33,220 --> 05:06:34,720
So I call him dad for those who are new here.

4342
05:06:35,140 --> 05:06:35,840
But for those who are...

4343
05:06:35,840 --> 05:06:36,860
Someone was asking what are you.

4344
05:06:36,860 --> 05:06:37,120
So straight up.

4345
05:06:37,140 --> 05:06:38,040
I'm a variety streamer.

4346
05:06:38,320 --> 05:06:39,500
I stream whatever.

4347
05:06:41,200 --> 05:06:41,880
Oh yeah.

4348
05:06:42,360 --> 05:06:47,180
For those who missed the beginning of the stream, I got invited to a business trip event.

4349
05:06:47,940 --> 05:06:48,620
It's not TwitchCon.

4350
05:06:49,340 --> 05:06:54,400
So I will be gone at the end of the week and I'll be back on, I think, Wednesday.

4351
05:06:54,700 --> 05:06:55,600
I'll be back on Wednesday.

4352
05:06:56,020 --> 05:06:56,960
I think I'm leaving?

4353
05:06:57,900 --> 05:06:59,240
I want to say when I'm leaving.

4354
05:07:00,500 --> 05:07:03,340
But I'll be leaving at the end of the week and I'll be back on Wednesday.

4355
05:07:03,440 --> 05:07:04,300
It was so last minute.

4356
05:07:04,300 --> 05:07:26,380
Um, it was super last minute because like I literally booked my tickets this week It's like I don't twitch con is also next week, but it's not twitch con So I'll be going on business trip, uh, this week I think this year I'm trapped.

4357
05:07:26,660 --> 05:07:43,940
I'm proud of myself because this year I'm traveling more I'm like doing things were like, I guess like myself in terms of like going outside and enjoying life a bit more.

4358
05:07:45,200 --> 05:07:47,620
This year's my personal growth year.

4359
05:07:49,740 --> 05:07:51,280
30 seconds before you attack.

4360
05:07:51,740 --> 05:07:52,120
Get ready.

4361
05:07:58,190 --> 05:07:59,270
What troubles you saw?

4362
05:07:59,750 --> 05:08:04,810
Oh, just across all space and time and we're stuck in the middle.

4363
05:08:05,870 --> 05:08:06,570
Yeah, it's nothing big.

4364
05:08:06,710 --> 05:08:07,510
Oh, I'm so scared.

4365
05:08:07,710 --> 05:08:08,850

4366
05:08:10,970 --> 05:08:11,730

Okay, uh, Spider-Man.

4370
05:08:18,450 --> 05:08:21,410
I will always have the underlying fear.

4371
05:08:33,040 --> 05:08:35,620
Oh, they have Punisher.

4372
05:08:35,860 --> 05:08:36,540

And they have Punisher.

I was looking at him.

4394
05:11:52,460 --> 05:11:55,980
Oh my, oh my, Nia!

There's nowhere for me to go.

4397
05:12:05,420 --> 05:12:07,760
There's actual nowhere for me to go.

4398
05:12:08,740 --> 05:12:09,140
How?

4399
05:12:09,440 --> 05:12:11,200
What the fuck do you mean?

4400
05:12:11,460 --> 05:12:13,320
There's four people on point.

4401
05:12:13,760 --> 05:12:15,500
We can win this fighting.

4402
05:12:15,500 --> 05:12:20,080
We need another support.

4403
05:12:20,240 --> 05:12:21,360
I cannot do this.

4404
05:12:21,920 --> 05:12:24,380
I cannot do this.

4405
05:12:24,960 --> 05:12:29,290
Fuck you dead.

4406
05:12:30,050 --> 05:12:30,330
He's raised.

4407
05:12:30,530 --> 05:12:30,710
He's raised.

4408
05:12:36,390 --> 05:12:37,750
All right.

4409
05:12:38,530 --> 05:12:40,930
I have to use this.

4410
05:12:41,490 --> 05:12:44,750
He got kicked out.

4411
05:12:45,170 --> 05:12:48,070
I don't have any support.

4412
05:12:48,130 --> 05:12:48,930
I'm getting flanked right now.

4413
05:12:49,330 --> 05:12:49,670
I'm getting flanked right now.

4414
05:12:53,770 --> 05:12:55,310
There's nothing I can do.

4415
05:12:56,250 --> 05:12:59,610
Oh, thank you.

4416
05:13:00,250 --> 05:13:00,590
Thank you.

4417
05:13:03,850 --> 05:13:05,530
They went triple supporters.

4418
05:13:07,710 --> 05:13:08,510
Thank you.

4419
05:13:09,990 --> 05:13:12,070
Because I don't think any of these people are them.

4420
05:13:15,550 --> 05:13:17,810
We can win this, guys.

4421
05:13:18,270 --> 05:13:19,010
I'm like, no.

4422
05:13:19,870 --> 05:13:21,870
No, get me out of here again.

4423
05:13:25,850 --> 05:13:26,250
Yeah.

4424
05:13:27,510 --> 05:13:30,470
Why didn't we- why did we bat- who bat- I'm gonna look at the replay.

4425
05:13:30,530 --> 05:13:31,770
I need to know who bat mag.

4426
05:13:32,030 --> 05:13:33,450
Oh my god, it must have been the Spider-Man.

4427
05:13:34,670 --> 05:13:37,470
Oh my god, I swear to God if it was a Spider-Man.

4428
05:13:37,810 --> 05:13:39,210
I swear to God.

4429
05:13:41,230 --> 05:13:44,690
I'm forced on Luna duty only because we have a Spider-Man too.

4430
05:13:47,770 --> 05:13:49,450
And this would probably be good.

4431
05:13:49,870 --> 05:14:32,430

Monkey flanking left.

4433
05:14:41,450 --> 05:14:43,250
Armed and dangerous.

4434
05:14:43,850 --> 05:14:44,370
Oh yeah.

4435
05:14:45,670 --> 05:14:46,270
Nice.

4436
05:14:46,510 --> 05:14:46,810
Nice.

4437
05:14:48,750 --> 05:14:49,430
Not nice.

4438
05:14:50,350 --> 05:14:51,490
They have so many res.

4439
05:14:51,590 --> 05:14:52,630
This is actually crazy.

4440
05:14:54,190 --> 05:14:55,730
This is not winnable.

4441
05:14:56,430 --> 05:14:57,850
This is not winnable.

4442
05:15:00,770 --> 05:15:04,470
Oh, Rigsie, you want to play Wolverine here for this element?

4443
05:15:04,730 --> 05:15:04,790
What?

4444
05:15:04,790 --> 05:15:06,730
That's just rolling us.

4445
05:15:08,370 --> 05:15:09,510
I can't throw.

4446
05:15:12,030 --> 05:15:12,630
What?

4447
05:15:19,510 --> 05:15:20,850
I'm just playing to play.

4448
05:15:22,930 --> 05:15:24,970
Honestly, I don't know how long I'll be playing for.

4449
05:15:25,670 --> 05:15:27,390
I'm just playing because it's fun.

4450
05:15:29,390 --> 05:15:30,530
I'm still having fun.

4451
05:15:31,770 --> 05:15:33,090
But like, bro.

4452
05:15:36,570 --> 05:15:40,250
I can heal us.

4453
05:15:42,010 --> 05:15:42,790
Jesus Christ.

4454
05:15:43,310 --> 05:15:47,630
Oh, I would love to heal you yet.

4455
05:15:50,910 --> 05:15:53,510
Oh, that's sad.

4456
05:15:55,470 --> 05:16:00,450
Oh, that...

4457
05:16:04,170 --> 05:16:04,850
What?

4458
05:16:06,810 --> 05:16:08,510
Oh, there he is.

4459
05:16:08,890 --> 05:16:08,950
Adam.

4460
05:16:11,510 --> 05:16:12,290
She's one.

4461
05:16:12,390 --> 05:16:12,670
She's one.

4462
05:16:12,950 --> 05:16:13,430
Adam one.

4463
05:16:14,610 --> 05:16:14,930
All right.

4464
05:16:19,230 --> 05:16:19,450
Bro.

4465
05:16:19,930 --> 05:16:19,970
Bro.

4466
05:16:20,490 --> 05:16:20,490
Why?

4467
05:16:21,550 --> 05:16:22,230
Why?

4468
05:16:22,550 --> 05:16:24,630
Do you not care about your life?

4469
05:16:26,010 --> 05:16:27,490
Adam's gonna rest.

4470
05:16:28,070 --> 05:16:29,550
I'm born again.

4471
05:16:30,490 --> 05:16:32,390
Then you want save for him.

4472
05:16:33,450 --> 05:16:34,130
What?

4473
05:16:38,330 --> 05:16:39,530
Oh, we definitely...

4474
05:16:39,530 --> 05:16:40,050
Oh.

4475
05:16:41,410 --> 05:16:42,270
We definitely...

4476
05:16:43,250 --> 05:16:45,430
Yeah, we definitely did not need that.

4477
05:16:46,770 --> 05:16:48,630
Oh, that's awkward.

4478
05:16:49,970 --> 05:16:51,350
Oh, that's awkward.

4479
05:16:52,190 --> 05:16:52,970

4480
05:16:55,130 --> 05:16:55,810
Bro.

4481
05:16:57,890 --> 05:16:58,390

4482
05:16:58,510 --> 05:16:58,730
Bro.

4483
05:16:58,730 --> 05:16:59,450

4486
05:17:02,530 --> 05:17:03,070

4487
05:17:03,090 --> 05:17:05,330
That bro.

4488
05:17:06,070 --> 05:17:07,310
What the fuck?

4489
05:17:08,810 --> 05:17:09,090
That's good.

4490
05:17:10,190 --> 05:17:11,250
I think he resists.

4491
05:17:12,630 --> 05:17:13,150
Oh no no he doesn't.

4492
05:17:16,070 --> 05:17:16,970
No he doesn't.

4493
05:17:17,070 --> 05:17:17,570
Oh.

4494
05:17:17,810 --> 05:17:19,330
Oh bro.

4495
05:17:20,910 --> 05:17:23,550
We don't even have friends.

4496
05:17:25,310 --> 05:17:26,470
That's our two DPS.

4497
05:17:29,050 --> 05:17:30,550
Oh no.

4498
05:17:36,710 --> 05:17:37,230
Oh,

4499
05:17:42,610 --> 05:17:44,510

4500
05:17:44,510 --> 05:17:44,870
Oh, that's unlucky.

4501
05:17:45,710 --> 05:17:46,790
I was trying to touch as much as possible.

4511
05:19:51,540 --> 05:19:53,300
I can change that.

4512
05:19:53,700 --> 05:19:54,620
I'm going to accept it.

4513
05:19:54,860 --> 05:19:55,180
Fuck it.

4514
05:19:55,360 --> 05:19:56,700
I'll accept it.

4515
05:19:58,640 --> 05:20:01,020
Get out of there, buddy.

4516
05:20:03,300 --> 05:20:09,040
It would be a shame if something happened to your secure top 500.

4517
05:20:09,880 --> 05:20:12,080
Oh, it would be a shame indeed.

4518
05:20:18,960 --> 05:20:20,700
Oh, yeah, I was gonna watch the replay.

4519
05:20:22,740 --> 05:20:23,660
I need to know.

4520
05:20:27,710 --> 05:20:28,870
Who banned this?

4521
05:20:29,870 --> 05:20:31,490
Where are we at the...

4522
05:20:31,490 --> 05:20:32,170
Rigsie!

4523
05:20:32,450 --> 05:20:33,850
You fucking...

4524
05:20:35,410 --> 05:20:39,390
It was a inside jump!

4525
05:20:39,850 --> 05:20:42,270
It was a fucking...

4526
05:20:42,270 --> 05:20:43,330
It was a

4527
05:20:46,420 --> 05:20:47,160
fucking...

4528
05:20:47,160 --> 05:20:48,940
Rigsie, the moment...

4529
05:20:48,940 --> 05:20:49,740
The moment...

4530
05:20:49,740 --> 05:20:50,540
Oh, shit, sorry.

4531
05:20:50,960 --> 05:20:52,260
I cancelled match.

4532
05:20:52,400 --> 05:20:53,260
Wait, Riku.

4533
05:20:54,600 --> 05:20:55,400
Rik...

4534
05:20:55,940 --> 05:20:59,820
Req, I accidentally cancelled.

4535
05:21:03,360 --> 05:21:08,660
It was an inside job the entire time.

4536
05:21:09,620 --> 05:21:11,240
Oh, the betrayal!

4537
05:21:12,080 --> 05:21:15,160
Why did you batman?

4538
05:21:19,620 --> 05:21:21,480
It was a setup.

4539
05:21:22,160 --> 05:21:22,980
Traitor!

4540
05:21:25,300 --> 05:21:27,680
The entire time.

4541
05:21:27,700 --> 05:21:48,100
I thought I can't believe it I can't believe It do be like that It do be like that Your own kind Your own duo Fucking it up for everyone

4545
05:23:45,240 --> 05:23:56,640

4547
05:24:06,940 --> 05:24:12,840
Because some people would accidentally, they would accidentally add people when they're trying to avoid them.

4548
05:24:19,250 --> 05:24:21,510
It was, I don't think that's an alt to count.

4549
05:24:21,770 --> 05:24:22,990
It's level 65.

4550
05:24:23,950 --> 05:24:26,570
That is way too high for an alt to count.

4551
05:24:28,630 --> 05:24:30,510
I do not think this is an alt.

4552
05:24:32,830 --> 05:24:33,770
Add note.

4553
05:24:37,170 --> 05:24:38,850
Unsecured top five.

4554
05:24:40,190 --> 05:24:40,190
Oh.

4555
05:24:42,550 --> 05:24:44,010
What is that?

4556
05:24:44,030 --> 05:24:44,450
No!

4557
05:24:44,790 --> 05:24:46,470
I wanted to get hurt.

4558
05:24:48,530 --> 05:24:50,070
Just so I remember.

4559
05:24:50,410 --> 05:24:51,850
I need to remember him.

4560
05:24:55,380 --> 05:24:56,600
I just wanted to be sure.

4561
05:25:03,010 --> 05:25:06,930
God intervened so that he could stop the note.

4562
05:25:09,410 --> 05:25:11,170
God was like, not to.

4563
05:25:11,190 --> 05:25:11,410
it.

4564
05:25:16,010 --> 05:25:16,890
No griefing.

4565
05:25:20,640 --> 05:25:21,420
Jesus Christ.

4566
05:25:26,830 --> 05:25:27,050
Alright.

4567
05:25:29,770 --> 05:25:31,550
I trust my team to do the bans.

4568
05:25:31,770 --> 05:25:33,550
I'm not gonna worry about it.

4569
05:25:33,790 --> 05:25:35,090
Maybe I'll just do a Zatsudan.

4570
05:25:35,830 --> 05:25:36,790
I don't know.

4571
05:25:36,870 --> 05:25:38,410
I don't know what to stream today.

4572
05:25:38,850 --> 05:25:40,070
Like later on YouTube.

4573
05:25:41,190 --> 05:25:42,190
I'll just do a Zatsudan.

4574
05:25:42,810 --> 05:25:52,230
I feel like I definitely won't be able to stay up to play so I feel like I'd be way too tired to stream Silk Song later.

4575
05:25:53,250 --> 05:25:57,710
I'll just, like, I'll just do a normal Zastodon stream.

4576
05:26:02,960 --> 05:26:05,820
What if I stream more Rivals, but I need it to?

4577
05:26:11,740 --> 05:26:12,380
Unless...

4578
05:26:13,560 --> 05:26:18,480
Unless I just stream more Rivals, but it'll be on YouTube.

4579
05:26:19,840 --> 05:26:21,720
More Doom Q.

4580
05:26:22,660 --> 05:26:24,200
Ah, she took in...

4581
05:26:24,200 --> 05:26:24,440
Ah!

4582
05:26:28,180 --> 05:26:29,540
It's fine.

4583
05:26:31,780 --> 05:26:32,620
It's...

4584
05:26:32,620 --> 05:26:34,280
It's fine.

4585
05:26:39,130 --> 05:26:41,190
I love Marvel Rivals.

4586
05:26:45,990 --> 05:26:47,730
Bum, bum, bum.

4587
05:26:55,400 --> 05:26:57,320
Oh my god, it's here too.

4588
05:26:58,140 --> 05:26:59,460
Oh my god, I wish I could have.

4589
05:26:59,480 --> 05:27:00,480
I was attacked.

4590
05:27:04,140 --> 05:27:05,480
Finally, I don't like this map.

4591
05:27:09,000 --> 05:27:13,140
Keep you sane by watching me go fucking insane.

4592
05:27:13,980 --> 05:27:15,680
You're just like, at least it's not me.

4593
05:27:16,700 --> 05:27:19,020
But live vicariously through my doom queuing.

4594
05:27:19,180 --> 05:27:21,640
You're like, thank God it's not me that's doom queuing.

4595
05:27:23,160 --> 05:27:26,600
I get the same experience by just watching her.

4596
05:27:27,040 --> 05:27:28,860
The balance we need.

4597
05:27:29,700 --> 05:27:32,320
Three, two, one.

4598
05:27:33,560 --> 05:27:35,860
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

4599
05:27:38,220 --> 05:27:38,420
All right.

4600
05:27:39,400 --> 05:27:40,000
Oh, my God.

4601
05:27:40,120 --> 05:27:41,100
Is that a venom?

4602
05:27:44,400 --> 05:27:46,020
Oh, is that a...

4603
05:27:46,020 --> 05:27:47,980
Oh, my God.

4604
05:27:51,160 --> 05:27:51,640
Oh.

4605
05:27:52,480 --> 05:27:55,520
Hey, look at that.

4606
05:27:56,360 --> 05:27:57,360
Look at that.

4607
05:27:58,140 --> 05:27:59,340
Oh, look at that.

4608
05:27:59,480 --> 05:28:00,960
Oh boy!

4609
05:28:03,680 --> 05:28:04,040
Okay.

4610
05:28:09,000 --> 05:28:11,480
I can feel it.

4611
05:28:19,980 --> 05:28:20,800
Okay.

4612
05:28:23,460 --> 05:28:26,380
Hey, I hope she heals me too.

4613
05:28:27,880 --> 05:28:28,740
Oh, thank god.

4614
05:28:32,380 --> 05:28:33,940
This is where I die.

4615
05:28:46,740 --> 05:28:47,480
Unless...

4616
05:28:47,480 --> 05:28:47,840
Okay.

4617
05:28:49,040 --> 05:28:50,140
That's fine.

4618
05:28:51,360 --> 05:28:52,460
That's fine.

4619
05:28:53,620 --> 05:28:54,110
I just...

4620
05:28:54,480 --> 05:28:58,070
Why is it always me when I have to play...

4621
05:28:59,300 --> 05:29:03,540
When I have to play Luna, I have to go through Venom Spider-Man.

4622
05:29:03,800 --> 05:29:04,860
It's always...

4623
05:29:05,460 --> 05:29:07,780
Oh my god.

4624
05:29:09,640 --> 05:29:10,100
Oh.

4625
05:29:10,860 --> 05:29:11,820
Let's go.

4626
05:29:12,420 --> 05:29:13,560
Let's fucking move forward.

4627
05:29:13,740 --> 05:29:14,540
You're fine, right?

4628
05:29:15,480 --> 05:29:16,700
You're so healthy.

4629
05:29:16,980 --> 05:29:17,760
There we go.

4630
05:29:18,880 --> 05:29:19,920
There we go.

4631
05:29:20,900 --> 05:29:21,200
There we go.

4632
05:29:21,340 --> 05:29:22,100
Did we stabilize?

4633
05:29:22,660 --> 05:29:23,880
Did we stabilize?

4634
05:29:24,900 --> 05:29:26,060
Oh my god.

4635
05:29:26,640 --> 05:29:29,000
Oh My god.

4636
05:29:29,840 --> 05:29:34,700

Things are going really well.

4640
05:30:20,860 --> 05:30:24,120
Devlin, thank you for the...

4641
05:30:24,120 --> 05:30:25,940
Like, it's fine.

4642
05:30:26,120 --> 05:30:28,820
If we forfeit, I understand.

4643
05:30:31,580 --> 05:30:34,540
If we forfeit, I understand.

4644
05:30:35,620 --> 05:30:36,180
I understand.

4645
05:30:36,760 --> 05:30:38,860
Thank you for the 10 gift and thumbs.

4646
05:30:39,160 --> 05:30:40,120
Thank you, thank you.

4647
05:30:40,580 --> 05:30:44,120
Like, there's nothing we can do.

4648
05:30:44,720 --> 05:30:49,140
I don't know if there is anything we can do

4649
05:30:56,130 --> 05:31:21,490
That's okay sometimes life is just like that We just have they have spider-man venom we have blades and like Sometimes it's just like that it's wow we won guys I'll win this first We won our first fight, guys!

4650
05:31:22,610 --> 05:31:23,830
We did it!

4651
05:31:25,350 --> 05:31:26,670
Oh, they're opening up!

4652
05:31:27,070 --> 05:31:27,070
Oh!

4653
05:31:27,670 --> 05:31:29,150
That's unlucky.

4654
05:31:33,550 --> 05:31:37,950
All right, I don't have a shield now, so good luck everyone.

4655
05:31:43,380 --> 05:31:46,030
All right, did we do it?

4656
05:31:50,020 --> 05:31:50,800
Well...

4657
05:31:51,820 --> 05:31:53,380
What happened?

4658
05:31:58,530 --> 05:32:02,370
What the fuck even happened?

4659
05:32:04,490 --> 05:32:07,510
What the fuck is...

4660
05:32:07,510 --> 05:32:08,650
What happened?

4661
05:32:11,270 --> 05:32:14,750
Bro, that was like 800 ults all at once.

4662
05:32:15,010 --> 05:32:17,010
I don't even know what happened.

4663
05:32:17,850 --> 05:32:18,690
Holy shit.

4664
05:32:21,170 --> 05:32:25,330
I think we just used every ult possible to win that fight.

4665
05:32:25,950 --> 05:32:27,010
A nice deep freeze.

4666
05:32:27,510 --> 05:32:29,410
All right, get ready for the Spider-Man.

4667
05:32:29,790 --> 05:32:30,650
You guys ready?

4668
05:32:36,550 --> 05:32:37,730
Oh my god.

4669
05:32:38,870 --> 05:32:39,790
He messed up.

4670
05:32:44,790 --> 05:32:45,670
Oh my god.

4671
05:32:48,670 --> 05:32:49,810
He messed up.

4672
05:32:50,290 --> 05:32:51,190
There is a guy.

4673
05:32:55,170 --> 05:32:56,590
He actually messed up.

4674
05:33:01,420 --> 05:33:03,480
Oh my god, I don't know if they'll live.

4675
05:33:03,940 --> 05:33:04,960
I don't think he's...

4676
05:33:04,960 --> 05:33:05,820
Oh my god, he...

4677
05:33:05,840 --> 05:33:07,000
Where is he?

4678
05:33:07,800 --> 05:33:09,560
Say where did he go?

4679
05:33:11,420 --> 05:33:18,860
Yeah, I had a feeling he was he was fucking dead dead in there Oh, what the fuck

4680
05:33:22,700 --> 05:33:27,260
Oh shit, oh shit That's unlucky.

4681
05:33:28,040 --> 05:33:37,980
I thought I thought she was gonna alt first Oh, that's so bad That is so bad.

4682
05:33:38,380 --> 05:33:39,900
Our Invis did it all first.

4683
05:33:42,160 --> 05:33:44,760
I think it's time to go back to your one-trick, Angelou.

4684
05:33:50,680 --> 05:33:52,640
Why didn't our Invis?

4685
05:33:53,940 --> 05:33:55,780
Oh, she said me first.

4686
05:33:57,320 --> 05:33:57,440
Oh!

4687
05:34:01,350 --> 05:34:02,030
No.

4688
05:34:03,090 --> 05:34:05,790
You didn't say anything.

4689
05:34:13,060 --> 05:34:25,420
First time First time I heard was You first So I assume it's always you I didn't

4690
05:34:31,300 --> 05:34:39,660
always Love my powers Oh my god Apparently she's Steve was like You go Luna His VC isn't working

4691
05:34:43,560 --> 05:34:48,980

4692
05:34:55,180 --> 05:34:55,280
...

4693
05:34:56,820 --> 05:34:57,300
...

4694
05:34:57,300 --> 05:34:57,320
...

4695
05:34:57,320 --> 05:34:57,580
...

4696
05:35:11,400 --> 05:35:13,760
It's the Edo Terrorist tab.

4697
05:35:15,580 --> 05:35:16,900
Oh, he's fucked up.

4698
05:35:22,230 --> 05:35:28,750
That sucked that, like, you know, he, uh, he was like, you go, oh, first.

4699
05:35:31,250 --> 05:35:33,090
Oh my god, he actually hit.

4700
05:35:39,470 --> 05:35:45,750
That actually sucked that, like, he wanted to coordinate up.

4701
05:35:46,190 --> 05:35:48,330
Oh my god, he pooped him, so I couldn't freeze him.

4702
05:35:49,150 --> 05:35:52,630
And it was when I was supposed to, oh, he wanted me to ult first.

4703
05:35:54,510 --> 05:35:55,830
How unlucky was that?

4704
05:35:55,890 --> 05:35:57,290
We could have actually full held that.

4705
05:35:57,610 --> 05:35:58,230
Like, not...

4706
05:35:58,230 --> 05:36:00,830
I don't know if we could have, but...

4707
05:36:00,830 --> 05:36:02,450
It was giving us a higher chance.

4708
05:36:10,870 --> 05:36:11,350
Goodbye.

4709
05:36:12,050 --> 05:36:13,510
It was nice knowing you all.

4710
05:36:14,450 --> 05:36:15,010
Oh, shit.

4711
05:36:15,230 --> 05:36:15,970
What the fuck?

4712
05:36:16,550 --> 05:36:17,030
Hello!

4713
05:36:25,430 --> 05:36:25,910
Hello!

4714
05:36:25,910 --> 05:36:26,090
Hello!

4715
05:36:29,820 --> 05:36:32,340
Oh, yeah, we definitely could have held that.

4716
05:36:32,460 --> 05:36:34,180
Oh, yeah.

4717
05:36:35,380 --> 05:36:36,380
We would have held that.

4718
05:36:36,540 --> 05:36:37,800
We rotated our odds.

4719
05:36:39,880 --> 05:36:40,020
Oh.

4720
05:36:44,670 --> 05:36:45,190
Oh.

4721
05:36:46,850 --> 05:36:48,070
I was 99.

4722
05:36:49,410 --> 05:36:51,350
I was 99.

4723
05:36:54,990 --> 05:36:56,330
That was unlucky.

4724
05:36:57,410 --> 05:36:59,450
That was 99 for all.

4725
05:37:02,730 --> 05:37:04,470
That's so unlucky.

4726
05:37:06,230 --> 05:37:07,070
Bad time.

4727
05:37:07,210 --> 05:37:08,650
He actually got me at 99.

4728
05:37:08,670 --> 05:37:14,270
98 or 90 not What the fuck?

4729
05:37:15,090 --> 05:37:16,110
I can be reckless now.

4730
05:37:16,270 --> 05:37:16,910
Oh, there he is

4731
05:37:19,960 --> 05:37:44,550

4735
05:37:52,550 --> 05:37:54,530
I'm not strong enough.

4736
05:37:54,910 --> 05:37:57,090

4737
05:37:57,750 --> 05:37:59,030

4738
05:38:00,550 --> 05:38:00,910

Why did we put ourselves through this?

4776
05:41:24,040 --> 05:41:25,440
This is absolute hell.

Right now, I'm going through hell.

4778
05:41:31,180 --> 05:41:32,700

05:41:39,570 --> 05:41:41,250
Okay, that's fine.

4780
05:41:43,990 --> 05:41:45,050
There you go.

Why?

4790
05:42:15,160 --> 05:42:15,700
Why?

4791
05:42:16,680 --> 05:42:18,800
It would have been over.

4792
05:42:20,400 --> 05:42:21,900
It would have been over.

4793
05:42:22,400 --> 05:42:24,000
They let us cap on purpose.

4794
05:42:24,300 --> 05:42:25,280
There's no way.

4795
05:42:25,840 --> 05:42:30,580
There's no way they like seriously just fucked up.

4796
05:42:30,780 --> 05:42:31,520
There's no way.

4797
05:42:32,140 --> 05:42:34,700
They're here to farm more stats off of us.

4798
05:42:34,820 --> 05:42:36,780
There's no way they would do this to me.

4799
05:42:37,240 --> 05:42:42,060
Like, I refuse to believe that.

4800
05:42:44,700 --> 05:42:45,420
Wow.

4801
05:42:47,100 --> 05:42:50,280
I refuse to believe that this happened.

4802
05:42:52,700 --> 05:42:54,440
There's no way, this is not real.

4803
05:42:55,720 --> 05:42:57,380
There's no, it's not real.

4804
05:42:58,420 --> 05:43:00,240
They're throwing for content.

4805
05:43:00,480 --> 05:43:08,920
I refuse, I refuse to believe that, that I have to play this so much longer.

4806
05:43:09,640 --> 05:43:10,580
Still got an edge.

4807
05:43:20,080 --> 05:43:23,940
Oh my god, why would they do this to me?

4808
05:43:32,790 --> 05:43:34,850
How is he still alive?

4809
05:43:38,240 --> 05:43:46,800
The current score is 3, 2, 3 Okay.

4810
05:43:49,600 --> 05:43:51,180
There's no way.

4811
05:43:51,920 --> 05:43:52,580
There's no way.

4812
05:43:53,280 --> 05:44:05,280

Am I gonna get wrapped away?

4815
05:45:14,980 --> 05:45:15,820
Let's see.

4816
05:45:20,440 --> 05:45:22,600
Jesus Christ.

4817
05:45:26,480 --> 05:45:27,980
I need to reload, ma'am.

4818
05:45:32,560 --> 05:45:34,400
Ma'am, I gotta reload.

4819

I gotta keep reloading.

4820
05:45:40,600 --> 05:45:43,080
Okay.

4821
05:45:54,300 --> 05:45:54,880
No.

4822
05:45:56,680 --> 05:45:58,760
Oh my god.

4823
05:46:00,380 --> 05:46:03,620
Oh no, we lost our strength.

4824
05:46:09,330 --> 05:46:10,590
No.

4825
05:46:14,330 --> 05:46:15,910
Oh my god.

4826
05:46:19,030 --> 05:46:21,650
Oh my god, no!

4827
05:46:25,730 --> 05:46:29,230
No, I refuse to believe.

4828
05:46:30,390 --> 05:46:34,910
Believing is... I've already believed too much.

4829
05:46:38,990 --> 05:46:41,150
I refuse...

4830
05:46:56,700 --> 05:46:59,040
The current score is...

4831
05:47:00,580 --> 05:47:01,180
Three.

4832
05:47:02,700 --> 05:47:04,180
Time to switch things out.

4833
05:47:04,320 --> 05:47:05,220
You can't live through that.

4834
05:47:06,320 --> 05:47:06,920
I...

4835
05:47:08,840 --> 05:47:09,740
That was...

4836
05:47:10,040 --> 05:47:11,240
That was a nuke.

4837
05:47:11,360 --> 05:47:13,180
The moon is a shine in darkness.

4838
05:47:13,520 --> 05:47:15,560
The right heroes could make all the difference.

4839
05:47:15,680 --> 05:47:17,300
How do I react to that?

4840
05:47:18,180 --> 05:47:18,780
How?

4841
05:47:20,140 --> 05:47:22,400
How do you react to that?

4842
05:47:23,180 --> 05:47:24,660
How do you...

4843
05:47:24,660 --> 05:47:26,500
There's no reaction.

4844
05:47:28,160 --> 05:47:29,360
There's actually...

4845
05:47:29,360 --> 05:47:30,500
I can't react.

4846
05:47:30,520 --> 05:47:34,800

Okay.

4859
05:50:28,150 --> 05:50:28,910
Oh.

05:50:34,380 --> 05:50:35,500
It's fine.

4861
05:50:36,720 --> 05:50:38,880
We double support up, but it's fine.

4862
05:50:48,300 --> 05:50:52,560
We don't have support alts anymore, but it's okay.

4863
05:50:52,800 --> 05:50:53,000
Oh, wait.

4864
05:50:54,620 --> 05:50:54,640
Maybe.

4865
05:50:56,740 --> 05:50:58,040
I'll stay up here.

4866
05:50:58,600 --> 05:51:00,300
I'll stay up here.

4867
05:51:05,380 --> 05:51:11,180
I don't think he's healing

4868
05:51:15,980 --> 05:51:19,060

4869
05:51:23,370 --> 05:51:36,130

4870
05:51:36,610 --> 05:51:38,210
She destroyed my res.

4871
05:51:38,810 --> 05:51:41,610
Oh my

4872
05:51:45,110 --> 05:51:47,350
This is not good

4873
05:51:53,170 --> 05:51:55,610
Sorry, I just couldn't play Luna again.

4874
05:51:55,730 --> 05:52:04,390
I couldn't I like that it was See the moment I swapped off Luna he swapped off Potter, man.

4875
05:52:05,550 --> 05:52:07,430
Because there was no more targets.

4876
05:52:07,930 --> 05:52:09,990
He couldn't do anything anymore.

4877
05:52:10,530 --> 05:52:11,490
I just couldn't.

4878
05:52:11,850 --> 05:52:13,170
It was too much.

4879
05:52:17,650 --> 05:52:19,410
It was too much.

4880
05:52:19,490 --> 05:52:19,690
It was too much.

4881
05:52:19,690 --> 05:52:20,990
I'm just not strong enough.

4882
05:52:22,470 --> 05:52:23,590
It's not a rain climb.

4883
05:52:23,790 --> 05:52:24,830
It's just a doom kill.

4884
05:52:26,410 --> 05:52:29,050
There's no such thing as climbing during a doom kill.

4885
05:52:32,350 --> 05:52:33,690
Alright, what was this guy's name?

4886
05:52:33,750 --> 05:52:34,910

05:52:38,550 --> 05:52:39,950
Like a coward.

05:56:17,500 --> 05:56:18,020
Yes.

4945
05:56:18,680 --> 05:56:20,460

Who's Mopko Fett?

4947
05:56:22,420 --> 05:56:23,860
I can't believe we will Mega Load him.

4948
05:56:24,860 --> 05:56:30,400
To be fair, I'm not well versed in the China Ignite teams.

4949
05:56:31,500 --> 05:56:33,460
I only know the...

4950
05:56:33,460 --> 05:56:34,820
I like their team name.

4951
05:56:34,920 --> 05:56:36,520
Their team name is ORA Farmer.

4952
05:56:37,020 --> 05:56:38,980
And it's the title ORA.

4953
05:56:39,520 --> 05:56:40,580

05:56:45,720 --> 05:56:46,880
He is in Ignite.

4958
05:56:48,240 --> 05:56:50,300
Guys, we who Mega Lel the Pearl.

4959
05:56:51,220 --> 05:56:53,320
To be fair, I have an excuse.

4960
05:56:53,520 --> 05:56:54,080
I don't know.

4961
05:56:55,040 --> 05:57:00,260
I don't know the China scene for Ignite as well.

4962
05:57:00,800 --> 05:57:02,660

4963
05:57:02,660 --> 05:57:04,080

05:57:08,640 --> 05:57:09,740
I forgot their names.

4966
05:57:10,520 --> 05:57:12,220
But I do know two players.

4967
05:57:12,840 --> 05:57:14,220
I just forgot their names.

4968
05:57:15,260 --> 05:57:17,200
Okay, I guess I play...

4969
05:57:17,220 --> 05:57:18,600

4970
05:57:18,680 --> 05:57:19,180
Oh my god.

4971
05:57:19,480 --> 05:57:19,980

05:57:44,720 --> 05:57:49,240
I can search All right You're an ultra We can try that.

4978
05:57:49,620 --> 05:57:50,920
That bond is unbreakable.

4979
05:57:51,100 --> 05:57:52,900
Wait, I'll turn it open?

4980
05:57:53,700 --> 05:57:57,520

4988
05:58:16,540 --> 05:58:17,160

05:59:36,200 --> 05:59:36,420
Alright.

4999
05:59:38,240 --> 05:59:40,620
I'll let you know.

5000
05:59:40,800 --> 05:59:42,080
They just switched the mag, right?

5001
05:59:42,080 --> 05:59:42,580
Okay.

5002
05:59:46,320 --> 05:59:50,220
All right, Luna you can all first.

5003
05:59:52,180 --> 05:59:53,120
Oh, they're going to the right side with all.

5004
05:59:53,300 --> 05:59:54,020
They're going to the right side with all.

5005
05:59:54,160 --> 05:59:57,260
Let's try and kill them, Zy.

5006
05:59:57,340 --> 05:59:58,820
I've got a pick and I look...

5007
05:59:58,820 --> 05:59:59,480
What the?

5008
05:59:59,700 --> 06:00:00,260
What the?

5009
06:00:00,940 --> 06:00:02,260
Oh, where did he come from?

5010
06:00:04,100 --> 06:00:04,460
What?

5011
06:00:05,980 --> 06:00:06,700
Holy shit!

5012
06:00:07,580 --> 06:00:08,340
Where is he?

5013
06:00:08,340 --> 06:00:09,620
Okay, okay, I got you.

5014
06:00:10,140 --> 06:00:12,240
Oh, where is the fuck?

5015
06:00:12,580 --> 06:00:15,980
This is XQC actually speaks English.

5016
06:00:16,920 --> 06:00:19,140
Wait, what is he doing awake at this time?

5017
06:00:19,160 --> 06:00:20,260
Oh, he got inspired, right?

5018
06:00:20,900 --> 06:00:21,980
Ocean hug, ocean hug.

5019
06:00:23,420 --> 06:00:25,260
I just realized the...

5020
06:00:26,600 --> 06:00:28,740
The Ignite, the China Ignite play.

5021
06:00:29,220 --> 06:00:31,820
Oh my god, I can bring another pro down.

5022
06:00:32,300 --> 06:00:33,060
That's an honor.

5023
06:00:33,360 --> 06:00:40,680
Oh, this is a lot.

5024
06:00:41,000 --> 06:00:41,260
Nice.

5025
06:00:41,640 --> 06:00:42,100
Oh my god.

5026
06:00:42,760 --> 06:00:43,120
Okay.

5027
06:00:44,140 --> 06:00:45,240
Good luck, everyone.

5028
06:00:45,420 --> 06:00:46,160
Wait, Mike can die though.

5029
06:00:46,700 --> 06:00:47,240
Mike can die.

5030
06:00:47,540 --> 06:00:47,860
Mike can die.

5031
06:00:47,860 --> 06:00:49,100
Oh, he doesn't.

5032
06:00:49,240 --> 06:00:49,400
He doesn't.

5033
06:00:49,960 --> 06:00:50,440
Actually, maybe.

5034
06:00:50,620 --> 06:00:51,280
I'm always far clear.

5035
06:00:51,520 --> 06:00:51,700
Okay.

5036
06:00:52,820 --> 06:00:53,560
Oh, get out, get out.

5037
06:00:53,640 --> 06:00:54,060
Nice, nice.

5038
06:00:54,320 --> 06:00:54,780
Push that one.

5039
06:00:54,820 --> 06:00:55,280
Push that one.

5040
06:00:56,040 --> 06:00:56,700
There we go.

5041
06:00:56,860 --> 06:00:57,180
Nice, nice.

5042
06:00:57,400 --> 06:00:58,960
By the way, Phoenix, Phoenix.

5043
06:01:00,060 --> 06:01:00,320
Hello.

5044
06:01:00,540 --> 06:01:00,860
Goodbye.

5045
06:01:02,240 --> 06:01:05,100
I didn't want to ult that, but it was scary.

5046
06:01:05,300 --> 06:01:06,340
It was getting scary.

5047
06:01:08,620 --> 06:01:10,080
Oh my god, I got the damage, bro.

5048
06:01:12,740 --> 06:01:23,360
We have no other triple support if all fails If all it fails he does oh my god.

5049
06:01:23,520 --> 06:01:23,960
We're so fucked.

5050
06:01:24,160 --> 06:01:25,480
We're so we're so fucked.

5051
06:01:25,700 --> 06:01:27,260
We're so fucked We are so alive.

5052
06:01:27,500 --> 06:01:29,880
We're so oh my god.

5053
06:01:30,040 --> 06:01:30,700
We're so alive.

5054
06:01:31,240 --> 06:01:43,560
We're so I don't know how we live that Holy fuck It's so over It's not over yet I don't like tripping.

5055
06:01:43,900 --> 06:01:44,960
You know, we couldn't see her, I think.

5056
06:01:45,140 --> 06:01:45,920
I'm pretty sure she's...

5057
06:01:45,920 --> 06:01:48,000
All I'm saying is if he has...

5058
06:01:48,000 --> 06:01:52,300
If that is an alt account, I want me to get rid of more alt accounts.

5059
06:01:53,820 --> 06:01:54,800
Rocket, rocket, right side.

5060
06:01:54,940 --> 06:01:55,480
Rocket, right side.

5061
06:01:56,200 --> 06:01:57,860
He's one, he's one, he's one.

5062
06:01:59,560 --> 06:02:00,720
Strange is pushing us behind.

5063
06:02:01,020 --> 06:02:01,940
Strange is pushing behind.

5064
06:02:02,120 --> 06:02:02,480
Oh, shit!

5065
06:02:03,220 --> 06:02:03,500
Wait.

5066
06:02:04,180 --> 06:02:04,540
Nice.

5067
06:02:05,360 --> 06:02:06,360
Alright, it's fine.

5068
06:02:06,420 --> 06:02:07,100
Honey's behind the floor.

5069
06:02:07,840 --> 06:02:08,560
Nice, baby.

5070
06:02:10,600 --> 06:02:12,080
Where were these games?

5071
06:02:12,580 --> 06:02:15,340
Where the fuck were these guys?

5072
06:02:19,180 --> 06:02:21,440
I'm coming back everyone.

5073
06:02:22,860 --> 06:02:25,940
Don't worry, the hero is here.

5074
06:02:28,020 --> 06:02:29,740
The hero is...

5075
06:02:36,320 --> 06:02:38,220
It's fine, it's fine.

5076
06:02:38,480 --> 06:02:39,420
She's so healthy.

5077
06:02:40,060 --> 06:02:40,680
He's so healthy.

5078
06:02:43,100 --> 06:02:45,200
There's a dude on the right side.

5079
06:02:45,280 --> 06:02:46,360
Oh, nice.

5080
06:02:46,900 --> 06:02:46,900
Goodbye.

5081
06:02:54,660 --> 06:02:57,480
Maybe I can get him on the last day.

5082
06:03:00,280 --> 06:03:02,880
Because I'm like, what time is it over there now?

5083
06:03:03,300 --> 06:03:05,440
What time is it?

5084
06:03:07,660 --> 06:03:09,160
Jesus, he's midnight.

5085
06:03:10,240 --> 06:03:11,320

06:03:44,860 --> 06:03:46,240
It's really not that much like.

5089
06:03:46,580 --> 06:03:47,240
25 games.

5090
06:03:52,040 --> 06:03:53,280
I can't...

5091
06:03:53,280 --> 06:03:56,380
I can't stop imagining European XQC.

5092
06:03:56,720 --> 06:03:58,720
Yeah, I told you!

5093
06:03:58,820 --> 06:04:01,220
It is European XQC!

5094
06:04:01,720 --> 06:04:03,540
He sounds like...

5095
06:04:03,540 --> 06:04:05,820
But, like...

5096
06:04:05,820 --> 06:04:07,180
From Europe.

5097
06:04:07,380 --> 06:04:08,240
It's all I hear.

5098
06:04:10,220 --> 06:04:11,460
It's all I hear.

5099
06:04:11,480 --> 06:04:11,720
Yeah.

5100
06:04:13,260 --> 06:04:46,360

Oh, that's unlucky.

5102
06:04:51,520 --> 06:04:54,760
I can recognize he needs a little bit of healing.

5103
06:04:55,280 --> 06:04:55,880
Good luck.

5104
06:04:56,560 --> 06:05:02,160
We don't know, right?

5105
06:05:03,040 --> 06:05:05,380
I think they don't.

5106
06:05:05,820 --> 06:05:05,980
Oh!

5107
06:05:08,340 --> 06:05:12,240
I saw him, they blew up the smoke and I was like, oh.

5108
06:05:12,580 --> 06:05:13,660
I should leave.

5109
06:05:14,940 --> 06:05:17,580
I should really leave now.

5110
06:05:26,220 --> 06:05:29,440
Okay, I should.

5111
06:05:34,240 --> 06:05:35,440
Emma is pushing us.

5112
06:05:35,520 --> 06:05:36,100
Emma's pushing us.

5113
06:05:36,200 --> 06:05:36,620
Emma behind.

5114
06:05:36,640 --> 06:05:37,400
Emma behind left side.

5115
06:05:37,620 --> 06:05:38,240
Emma behind left side.

5116
06:05:38,620 --> 06:05:38,860
She's one.

5117
06:05:38,980 --> 06:05:39,160
She's one.

5118
06:05:39,160 --> 06:05:39,960
I got close.

5119
06:05:40,080 --> 06:05:40,620
I only have one here.

5120
06:05:40,620 --> 06:05:41,360
Okay.

5121
06:05:42,100 --> 06:05:42,850
Is this winnable?

5122
06:05:43,660 --> 06:05:44,140
I just have one.

5123
06:05:44,720 --> 06:05:45,660
Oh shit!

5124
06:05:46,660 --> 06:05:47,380
Oh I lost it!

5125
06:05:47,420 --> 06:05:48,040
I lost it.

5126
06:05:48,080 --> 06:05:48,320
I lost it.

5127
06:05:48,320 --> 06:05:49,100
He got cancelled.

5128
06:05:53,700 --> 06:05:54,520
I got cancelled.

5129
06:05:54,680 --> 06:05:55,760
I don't know what by me.

5130
06:05:56,020 --> 06:05:57,320
I got cancelled by Phoenix.

5131
06:05:58,260 --> 06:05:59,720
Let's get into some good trouble.

5132
06:06:00,080 --> 06:06:00,580
Again!

5133
06:06:01,640 --> 06:06:02,280
That's unlucky.

5134
06:06:02,480 --> 06:06:02,780
I should.

5135
06:06:02,940 --> 06:06:03,620
I'm gonna go Mantis.

5136
06:06:06,140 --> 06:06:06,640
That's unlucky.

5137
06:06:06,760 --> 06:06:07,280
I can't really go.

5138
06:06:08,840 --> 06:06:09,840
That's unlucky.

5139
06:06:10,620 --> 06:06:11,940
I'm about to kill the Luna.

5140
06:06:12,740 --> 06:06:12,920
Yeah.

5141
06:06:16,000 --> 06:06:17,820
Oh, this is unlucky.

5142
06:06:19,020 --> 06:06:19,720
I will turn.

5143
06:06:20,920 --> 06:06:21,000
Clapping.

5144
06:06:25,640 --> 06:06:26,240
Oh my god.

5145
06:06:27,060 --> 06:06:28,100
I have to be in it.

5146
06:06:28,320 --> 06:06:30,800
Four, three, four, two, one.

5147
06:06:30,980 --> 06:06:31,320
My ult is over.

5148
06:06:31,440 --> 06:06:31,680
Go back.

5149
06:06:35,540 --> 06:06:37,640
Oh, I can't do anything.

5150
06:06:40,880 --> 06:06:42,080
I got kicked.

5151
06:06:42,280 --> 06:06:47,880
Oh My god, I have to I have to

5152
06:07:03,540 --> 06:07:04,820

5153
06:07:05,560 --> 06:07:06,200
I'm here.

5154
06:07:06,200 --> 06:07:07,080
Okay, nice

5155
06:07:10,260 --> 06:07:15,460
Nice Oh my god.

5156
06:07:18,280 --> 06:07:18,880
Okay.

5157
06:07:23,780 --> 06:07:24,980
Oh, that was the code.

5158
06:07:27,580 --> 06:07:30,680
Oh my god, please.

5159
06:07:46,770 --> 06:07:48,970
This is scary.

5160
06:07:51,010 --> 06:07:53,190
Stop trying to cover the heels, everyone.

5161
06:07:53,510 --> 06:07:54,190
That's okay.

5162
06:07:54,370 --> 06:07:57,070
Oh my god.

5163
06:07:58,350 --> 06:07:58,690
Nice.

5164
06:07:59,630 --> 06:08:00,450
Lucky one, lucky one.

5165
06:08:02,510 --> 06:08:04,410
I, oh my.

5166
06:08:04,990 --> 06:08:05,910
Nice, nice, nice.

5167
06:08:06,650 --> 06:08:07,130
That's good.

5168
06:08:08,970 --> 06:08:11,050
Oh my god, the focus so high.

5169
06:08:12,910 --> 06:08:13,590
I can drag him.

5170
06:08:17,930 --> 06:08:24,410
I I'm just using here

5171
06:08:27,530 --> 06:08:29,590
Oh my god

5172
06:08:32,610 --> 06:08:33,550
It's fine.

5173
06:08:33,850 --> 06:08:34,090
It's fine.

5174
06:08:34,270 --> 06:08:35,150
It's just it's fine.

Just let me die It's fine Oh, he did it

5176
06:08:44,410 --> 06:08:44,990
Oh my god!

5177
06:08:45,470 --> 06:08:46,170
We were just trolling.

5178
06:08:46,470 --> 06:08:48,590
We were stagnant so badly for no reason.

5179
06:08:49,490 --> 06:08:50,990
We already had one fight in two minutes.

5180
06:08:52,490 --> 06:08:57,130
I had to focus so hard to stay alive.

5181
06:08:58,510 --> 06:09:00,730
Why was that game so hard?

5182
06:09:01,610 --> 06:09:04,230
I had to focus so hard.

5183
06:09:06,590 --> 06:09:11,150

5193
06:11:59,680 --> 06:12:01,960

5194
06:12:02,620 --> 06:12:05,920

06:13:14,160 --> 06:13:14,860

5211
06:13:18,740 --> 06:13:19,480
Is that it?

5212
06:13:22,220 --> 06:13:25,280
Oh my god, I streamed so long.

5213
06:13:25,700 --> 06:13:26,860
That's Necros hours.

5214
06:13:28,840 --> 06:13:31,580
That's how long I've been streaming for it.

5215
06:13:31,740 --> 06:13:33,540
It's Necro's hours now.

5216
06:13:33,620 --> 06:13:35,960
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

5217
06:13:39,960 --> 06:13:41,520
I'm in too deep, boys.

5218
06:13:43,480 --> 06:13:45,460
I'm in too deep now.

5219
06:13:47,140 --> 06:13:48,260
He's not even...

5220
06:13:48,260 --> 06:13:49,300
Is he even streaming?

5221
06:13:50,300 --> 06:13:51,620
Or did he just start stream?

5222
06:13:55,060 --> 06:13:56,880
He literally just started stream?

5223
06:14:00,000 --> 06:14:03,680
can fill, but I diff everyone in this lobby.

5224
06:14:08,110 --> 06:14:08,430

5228
06:14:23,830 --> 06:14:25,330
The actual Magneto.

5229
06:14:26,210 --> 06:14:26,390
Wow.

5230
06:14:27,030 --> 06:14:28,390

5231
06:14:28,390 --> 06:14:30,630
I don't even do you get it.

5232
06:14:31,450 --> 06:14:31,930
That's not true.

5233
06:14:32,630 --> 06:14:33,110
Necrows?

5234
06:14:33,890 --> 06:14:35,290

5235
06:14:39,490 --> 06:14:41,730
Are you talking about the enemy team?

5236
06:14:45,470 --> 06:14:49,290

5237
06:14:49,630 --> 06:14:51,390

5257
06:16:24,550 --> 06:16:26,030
That's why I didn't have my shield.

5258
06:16:26,350 --> 06:16:27,450
Okay, I have my ult though.

5259

06:18:35,480 --> 06:18:36,680
I can't afford this game.

5296
06:18:36,940 --> 06:18:37,360
You can sleep.

5297
06:18:37,800 --> 06:18:38,120

Stop fighting!

5300
06:18:43,560 --> 06:18:45,320
Not really bothering me.

5301
06:18:45,520 --> 06:18:47,040
No, no, no, no, we can win this.

5302
06:18:47,360 --> 06:18:48,540

5312
06:19:08,360 --> 06:19:09,600
Super Nova!

5313
06:19:12,320 --> 06:19:13,420
This is it.

5314
06:19:13,560 --> 06:19:16,080
I can't... I can't play.

5315
06:19:16,340 --> 06:19:18,400
I can't solo support this.

5316
06:19:18,700 --> 06:19:19,140
Don't make...

5317
06:19:19,140 --> 06:19:19,340
Stay in these.

5318
06:19:19,440 --> 06:19:20,440
Don't go walk in.

5319
06:19:22,820 --> 06:19:24,520
I don't really want us to stay in this.

5320
06:19:24,800 --> 06:19:25,360
I want support.

5321
06:19:27,340 --> 06:19:29,080
You're doing a lot of value.

5322
06:19:29,660 --> 06:19:30,040

06:26:43,360 --> 06:26:46,740
I did not realize they just put the portal down.

5409
06:26:47,820 --> 06:26:49,420
That's a little embarrassing.

5410
06:26:52,500 --> 06:26:54,300

06:26:58,160 --> 06:27:02,940

5433
06:29:36,850 --> 06:29:37,810
Okay.

06:29:46,980 --> 06:29:49,280
I just got here.

5435
06:29:50,700 --> 06:29:51,840
Hello, everyone.

5436
06:29:56,040 --> 06:29:58,000
Okay, it's fine.

5437
06:29:58,920 --> 06:29:59,620
It's fine.

5438
06:30:00,120 --> 06:30:00,880
It's fine.

5439
06:30:02,000 --> 06:30:04,060
It's so fine.

5440
06:30:06,840 --> 06:30:07,220
Okay.

5441
06:30:07,680 --> 06:30:11,180
I have 11 deaths, but I was heavily bullied.

5442
06:30:11,840 --> 06:30:13,200
I feel...

5443
06:30:15,100 --> 06:30:19,120
I feel like I'm getting heavily bullied right now.

5444
06:30:19,960 --> 06:30:21,460
I think this is it.

5445
06:30:21,600 --> 06:30:24,140
I think this is the last EU kill I'm playing.

5446
06:30:28,740 --> 06:30:30,680
This might be...

5447
06:30:31,200 --> 06:30:34,280
Don't, I'm not strong enough anymore.

5448
06:30:41,980 --> 06:30:42,200
Okay.

5449
06:30:44,780 --> 06:30:45,460
Okay.

5450
06:30:46,980 --> 06:30:48,880
I am locking in.

5451
06:30:49,320 --> 06:30:51,660
I'm doing my best to lock in.

5452
06:30:52,360 --> 06:30:52,440
What?

5453
06:30:54,080 --> 06:30:55,360
You're too deep bro.

5454
06:30:55,580 --> 06:30:56,480
You're too deep, bro.

5455
06:30:57,520 --> 06:30:57,820
Why?

5456
06:30:58,140 --> 06:31:01,200
I don't know.

5457
06:31:02,320 --> 06:31:03,140
I'm gonna go.

5458
06:31:04,280 --> 06:31:06,060
By the eye of Agumon.

5459
06:31:06,120 --> 06:31:06,960
Okay.

5460
06:31:08,120 --> 06:31:08,800
Goodbye.

5461
06:31:11,080 --> 06:31:12,240
Okay, bye.

5462
06:31:12,600 --> 06:31:14,020
I'm just trying to stall.

5463
06:31:14,680 --> 06:31:15,580
Hello, everyone.

5464
06:31:20,060 --> 06:31:21,420

5465
06:31:24,600 --> 06:31:25,960
I'm healing.

5466
06:31:26,920 --> 06:31:27,700
It's okay.

5467
06:31:28,040 --> 06:31:28,920
We have only Mantis heals.

5468
06:31:29,280 --> 06:31:29,280
Careful.

5469
06:31:29,540 --> 06:31:29,980
It's okay.

5470
06:31:32,200 --> 06:31:33,240
I'm okay.

5471
06:31:33,900 --> 06:31:34,920
It's okay.

5472
06:31:36,120 --> 06:31:37,500
It's okay.

5473
06:31:38,480 --> 06:31:41,340
It's absolutely fine.

5474
06:31:45,680 --> 06:31:47,080
Nice.

5475
06:31:50,960 --> 06:31:52,380
Like, it's fine.

5476
06:31:56,440 --> 06:31:57,840
It's okay.

5477
06:32:04,180 --> 06:32:05,540

Forever.

Okay, I'm back.

5505
06:47:45,070 --> 06:47:46,370
Our victim left.

5506
06:47:48,010 --> 06:47:50,730
You can queue.

5507
06:47:54,110 --> 06:47:55,070
Unlucky.

5508
06:47:57,030 --> 06:47:58,590
The victim is gone.

5509
06:48:04,910 --> 06:48:07,030
I'm so sad.

5510
06:48:13,570 --> 06:48:15,790
I'm so sad, everyone.

5511
06:48:16,590 --> 06:48:18,530
We were so close.

5512
06:48:27,760 --> 06:48:29,000
He knew.

5513
06:48:30,740 --> 06:48:31,980
He knew my plan.

5514
06:48:32,580 --> 06:48:33,400
My third moderate.

5515
06:48:33,740 --> 06:48:34,140
I hate it.

5516
06:48:34,160 --> 06:48:36,360
My third moderate dies if I stream too long.

5517
06:48:36,820 --> 06:48:40,420
That's what I can't do, like, I don't know what's wrong with my third monitor.

5518
06:48:41,060 --> 06:48:42,960
Because sometimes it just dies.

5519
06:48:43,760 --> 06:48:44,840
I don't know what to do.

5520
06:48:44,920 --> 06:48:46,960
Like, there's no counter to it.

5521
06:48:49,440 --> 06:48:51,660
Oh, my match history is mega private.

5522
06:48:52,900 --> 06:48:54,200
So people won't know.

5523
06:48:55,440 --> 06:48:57,920
People won't know how much I've suffered.

5524
06:49:02,040 --> 06:49:07,080
It's just, like, it dies whenever, like, whenever, like, I stream too long.

5525
06:49:09,520 --> 06:49:40,120
but I personally think it's not long enough oh he got his new toy I bought this new toy for him new toy for dad and it has like five squeakers and he's destroyed all the squeakers except for one because there's like squeakers in like each section of this giant cat caterpillar toy and I bought it yesterday and he's destroyed all of them except for one.

5526
06:49:43,860 --> 06:49:45,700
Oh, he even got off line.

5527
06:49:46,480 --> 06:49:47,000
Oh, my God.

5528
06:49:47,260 --> 06:49:47,760
He got off.

5529
06:49:50,740 --> 06:49:53,180
He got off line.

5530
06:49:53,780 --> 06:49:56,140
I wrote, do you want to do him?

5531
06:49:56,300 --> 06:49:59,040
And he never even got off line.

5532
06:49:59,600 --> 06:50:02,880
He was online when I messaged him.

5533
06:50:04,820 --> 06:50:07,100
He ran far.

5534
06:50:07,580 --> 06:50:09,320
Far away.

5535
06:50:09,980 --> 06:50:10,820
He's gone.

5536
06:50:11,060 --> 06:50:11,420
God.

5537
06:50:14,820 --> 06:50:16,600
He's like, scatter.

5538
06:50:18,920 --> 06:50:19,840
I love him.

5539
06:50:21,480 --> 06:50:25,240
How far until you derink.

5540
06:50:32,520 --> 06:50:34,820
You gotta know.

5541
06:50:36,000 --> 06:50:38,960
Because if you derink, we can add third victim.

5542
06:50:42,760 --> 06:50:43,600
I'm...

5543
06:50:43,600 --> 06:50:45,580
Are you...

5544
06:50:46,160 --> 06:50:48,440
Are you...

5545
06:50:48,440 --> 06:50:50,540
One game away?

5546
06:50:51,960 --> 06:50:52,760
To...

5547
06:50:52,760 --> 06:50:54,200
Gosh, gosh darn it.

5548
06:50:54,480 --> 06:50:55,460
Thank God.

5549
06:50:57,020 --> 06:50:58,420
That's...

5550
06:50:58,420 --> 06:50:59,840
Aww.

5551
06:51:01,380 --> 06:51:02,220
Oh.

5552
06:51:04,320 --> 06:51:05,020
Okay.

5553
06:51:17,930 --> 06:51:45,720
unlucky all right oh my god there's a diamond on which hero do you think you want to be today if we lose this we lose a lot because the enemy team has a diamond i think i want to go back to eu i you can add eu you can add eu back into the you.

5554
06:51:47,560 --> 06:51:51,220
This is definitely worse.

5555
06:51:58,720 --> 06:51:59,700
This is worse.

5556
06:52:01,160 --> 06:52:02,720
This is definitely worse.

5557
06:52:06,020 --> 06:52:08,580
Hey, maybe Rixie, dodge and dodge now.

5558
06:52:09,180 --> 06:52:10,820
Let me be free.

5559
06:52:15,490 --> 06:52:32,180
I can't believe he ran away too late too late to back down now oh here we go it's

5560
06:52:35,570 --> 06:52:52,170
okay maybe we'll get more victims maybe we'll encounter more never back there is a diamond this might be the one lost that they're actually

5561
06:52:55,590 --> 06:53:10,550
yeah we when we get like 15 points or some shit is crazy life is just not fair who would have thought okay oh my god why do we have a spotty mess

5562
06:53:15,030 --> 06:53:48,910
oh my god why back at it again alright rixie does not want to derink into my my rank right now he's like he even picked a match this bro this guy never barely ever plays triple support and he's that desperate sounds like you have some pretty amazing friends he is He's not fucking around.

5563
06:53:49,710 --> 06:53:50,430
I didn't even see it.

5564
06:53:50,590 --> 06:53:53,150
Does anyone see if the diamond was a smurf or not?

5565
06:53:53,650 --> 06:53:54,370
Good with the levels.

5566
06:53:55,030 --> 06:53:55,590
Anyone see?

5567
06:53:55,790 --> 06:53:57,130
Because I didn't.

5568
06:53:58,090 --> 06:54:00,630
He's fighting where his life now.

5569
06:54:02,710 --> 06:54:03,950
It's like, no.

5570
06:54:04,890 --> 06:54:06,250
Don't do this.

5571
06:54:06,330 --> 06:54:07,190
Oh my god.

5572
06:54:07,270 --> 06:54:08,590
I don't know if that's our Angela.

5573
06:54:09,470 --> 06:54:09,770
Okay.

5574
06:54:11,390 --> 06:54:12,950
I was worried.

5575
06:54:16,210 --> 06:54:17,970
We should destroy these arcs.

5576
06:54:19,010 --> 06:54:20,590
Oh, Wigsie is not...

5577
06:54:21,390 --> 06:54:21,990
Never mind.

5578
06:54:22,350 --> 06:54:23,190
Oh my god.

5579
06:54:24,830 --> 06:54:26,550
I have to play in this.

5580
06:54:28,110 --> 06:54:30,290
Not out of...

5581
06:54:30,290 --> 06:54:32,150
Not because I want...

5582
06:54:32,150 --> 06:54:34,570
Oh my god, I have to play in this.

5583
06:54:35,310 --> 06:54:35,950
I...

5584
06:54:38,830 --> 06:54:39,470
Please!

5585
06:54:41,790 --> 06:54:43,070
I can't...

5586
06:54:43,070 --> 06:54:45,190
I can't play this.

5587
06:54:45,410 --> 06:54:46,510
I can't play...

5588
06:54:46,510 --> 06:54:48,230
I can't play that into that.

5589
06:54:49,610 --> 06:54:50,730
Oh my god.

5590
06:54:50,950 --> 06:54:53,210
In fact, I think I have to play Rocket.

5591
06:54:53,570 --> 06:54:57,550
That's like not the most ideal for me.

5592
06:55:01,760 --> 06:55:02,620
I cannot.

5593
06:55:03,020 --> 06:55:03,720
I cannot.

5594
06:55:06,340 --> 06:55:09,240
I am not playing Luna against that.

5595
06:55:10,200 --> 06:55:11,980
Guys, I am not.

5596
06:55:12,500 --> 06:55:13,400
I don't care.

5597
06:55:13,520 --> 06:55:17,940
I'm not playing Luna against whatever the shit I just saw.

5598
06:55:25,620 --> 06:55:29,780
Holy shit, what the fuck is this?

5599
06:55:30,460 --> 06:55:31,900

06:55:47,940 --> 06:55:49,140
Oh shit, okay.

5607
06:55:50,000 --> 06:55:50,880
It's still fine.

5608
06:55:52,620 --> 06:55:57,460
This is this is I don't know how I died to that though.

5609
06:55:57,500 --> 06:56:10,800
I should not have died to Oh, it's gonna be like telling me like it's your friendly neighborhood spider-man Don't mess with the amazing spider-man and then we all ran away.

5610
06:56:11,400 --> 06:56:22,360
Oh my god Okay Where They will never know They would never know.

5611
06:56:22,460 --> 06:56:23,860
How would they know?

Was the diamond one and 11?

5613
06:56:26,300 --> 06:56:27,580

They don't see this.

5626
06:56:54,640 --> 06:56:56,900
They don't know.

5627
06:57:00,690 --> 06:57:03,450

5628
06:57:04,610 --> 06:57:12,840

5696
07:03:29,010 --> 07:03:31,850
GM, okay, I'll do it.

5697
07:03:32,250 --> 07:03:33,950
I don't want him to be honest.

5698
07:03:33,970 --> 07:03:37,010
Okay, Grandmaster 1.

5699
07:03:37,670 --> 07:03:41,710
The jamming toasty.

5700
07:03:42,750 --> 07:03:43,810
Oh, wait.

5701
07:03:43,890 --> 07:03:45,930
I think he's a legit diamond player.

5702
07:03:48,170 --> 07:03:49,550
Oh, my God.

5703
07:03:49,810 --> 07:03:50,410
He is.

5704
07:03:50,790 --> 07:03:53,290
Wait, he is a legit...

5705
07:03:53,290 --> 07:03:53,630
Okay.

5706
07:03:57,660 --> 07:03:58,000
Wait.

5707
07:03:58,580 --> 07:04:00,960
I just avoided it.

5708
07:04:01,740 --> 07:04:02,040
Alright.

5709
07:04:04,940 --> 07:04:07,420
How could you tell it?

5710
07:04:12,260 --> 07:04:21,760
Jesus Christ That was a game How is the dooming going on?

5711
07:04:22,060 --> 07:04:22,700
Are you ranked?

5712
07:04:24,600 --> 07:04:26,660
Is that a good answer?

5713
07:04:28,980 --> 07:04:30,060
Oh, pizza's on

5714
07:04:33,590 --> 07:04:39,730
Let's see It's a guy turn So I can't fuck his game He's up.

5715
07:04:39,850 --> 07:04:42,090
Fuck his memes up, sadly.

5716
07:04:43,270 --> 07:04:47,530
He's been, he's been, he queues every day, six plus hours a day.

5717
07:04:48,570 --> 07:04:53,130
I mean, that's almost like me, but the difference is that he climbs.

5718
07:04:56,590 --> 07:04:58,710
I don't know.

5719
07:04:59,970 --> 07:05:00,210
Damn.

5720
07:05:01,250 --> 07:05:04,730
Six, actually, like, maybe like six to eight hours a day.

5721
07:05:10,240 --> 07:05:11,920
But he actually got to eternity.

5722
07:05:13,120 --> 07:05:15,460
He like was up and down.

5723
07:05:16,720 --> 07:05:17,460
Like, no, he...

5724
07:05:17,460 --> 07:05:19,500
Sometimes he is, because he plays like...

5725
07:05:19,500 --> 07:05:20,300
Fuck you, Blade.

5726
07:05:21,920 --> 07:05:23,360
Blade and Fantastic.

5727
07:05:29,050 --> 07:05:29,710
The support...

5728
07:05:29,710 --> 07:05:31,910
Yeah, support can only do so much.

5729
07:05:31,970 --> 07:05:33,970
Oh my god, wait, he's back online.

5730
07:05:40,020 --> 07:05:41,140
He's back.

5731
07:05:50,630 --> 07:05:52,270
He went on a walk.

5732
07:05:52,290 --> 07:06:17,530
too yeah why didn't he respond to the duo request he responded to everything else you think he knows like I'm not throwing I'm not he's just my aura I drag everyone down not my fault he knows I'm cursed

5733
07:06:22,290 --> 07:06:24,730
I don't know what you mean.

5734
07:06:25,770 --> 07:06:31,250
Look, even though I'm cursed, it's still a fun time for me.

5735
07:06:31,650 --> 07:06:34,390
We don't talk about that one match where...

5736
07:06:34,390 --> 07:06:36,890
Where I got, like, absolutely fucked.

5737
07:06:37,310 --> 07:06:38,810
We don't talk about that game.

5738
07:06:38,890 --> 07:06:41,310
That game was just a mess in general.

5739
07:06:42,870 --> 07:06:43,750
It was actually...

5740
07:06:43,750 --> 07:06:45,510
It was just, like, a roller coaster.

5741
07:06:47,190 --> 07:06:48,470
I got, like...

5742
07:06:49,210 --> 07:06:49,770
I...

5743
07:06:49,770 --> 07:06:50,530
I...

5744
07:06:50,530 --> 07:06:52,270
I got, like...

5745
07:06:52,290 --> 07:06:55,150
heavily aggressed on.

5746
07:07:01,560 --> 07:07:05,580
Like, that was not a fair game whatsoever.

5747
07:07:06,340 --> 07:07:09,000
Jesus Christ, where they have two top 500 on you.

5748
07:07:09,700 --> 07:07:11,260
Why am I in these lobbies?

5749
07:07:12,840 --> 07:07:14,380
I'm just a little guy.

5750
07:07:18,190 --> 07:07:19,350
Please don't make me play.

5751
07:07:20,050 --> 07:07:21,710
Please don't make me play Luna.

5752
07:07:23,030 --> 07:07:25,210
I'm so done with Luna.

5753
07:07:25,750 --> 07:07:26,110
I'm so done with Luna.

5754
07:07:31,160 --> 07:07:33,460
I'm trying to drag you down my Elo.

5755
07:07:33,580 --> 07:07:34,840
Why you no respawn?

5756
07:07:37,800 --> 07:07:38,600
Oh, man.

5757
07:07:38,840 --> 07:07:41,020
I don't like... I don't like Lunar and the cold water.

5758
07:07:41,680 --> 07:07:51,160
Lunar and current... Did you guys... Okay, that game where I got, like, ran out by four dive characters was not fun at all.

5759
07:07:57,660 --> 07:07:59,120
It was a trulia.

5760
07:07:59,520 --> 07:08:00,320
I sent... Yeah.

5761
07:08:00,880 --> 07:08:04,880
I sent you an invitation to become an Elo terrorist.

5762
07:08:05,340 --> 07:08:16,440
With me please respond I was shoved into a locker and you're like you're not coming out of spawn I'm like, please sir.

5763
07:08:16,740 --> 07:08:18,260
I just want to play the game

5764
07:08:22,960 --> 07:08:26,760
They wouldn't even let me leave the spawn door

5765
07:08:40,050 --> 07:08:41,830
Alright, here you go.

5766
07:08:42,250 --> 07:08:42,990
That's cool.

5767
07:08:43,270 --> 07:09:31,030
That's cool though finding out that other pro player Watch me I don't know why But They're not learning anything But that's cool I It's like Do they take enjoyment Out of my pain Like I don't know It's just For me when pro players watch me I'm like Why are you watching me I'm just like You're just like Watching me play rivals and getting like shit on by three times kid is like thank god that's not me like because they're definitely not learning they're not learning from me

5770
07:09:51,770 --> 07:09:53,190
Oh, that's cool.

5771
07:09:54,830 --> 07:09:55,450
Oh, no, thank God.

5772
07:09:55,710 --> 07:09:56,350
Actually, that's good.

5773
07:09:56,530 --> 07:09:56,750
I went.

5774
07:09:59,890 --> 07:10:01,110
That's good that I went.

5775
07:10:07,830 --> 07:10:09,670
Okay, I didn't want to...

5776
07:10:10,390 --> 07:10:12,290
I don't have another push though.

5777
07:10:16,950 --> 07:10:20,930
I'm trying to like use... Oh, what the fuck?

5778
07:10:22,750 --> 07:10:23,950
That's unlucky.

5779
07:10:24,810 --> 07:10:25,750
That's so unlucky.

5780
07:10:31,220 --> 07:10:31,880
Oh no.

5781
07:10:34,780 --> 07:10:36,540
It's definitely harder to...

5782
07:10:39,080 --> 07:10:42,560
It's definitely harder to do a push because of the ping.

5783
07:10:45,080 --> 07:10:47,260
It's harder to control it.

5784
07:10:49,860 --> 07:10:52,040
I think if it was...

5785
07:10:52,040 --> 07:10:55,040
If I was playing any, I could do the push easier.

5786
07:10:59,540 --> 07:11:00,640
Jesus, I have to be aware.

5787
07:11:01,360 --> 07:11:02,080
There we go.

5788
07:11:02,680 --> 07:11:03,940
Got the push, guys!

5789
07:11:04,400 --> 07:11:05,680
I did it!

5790
07:11:08,440 --> 07:11:09,660
Oh my god.

5791
07:11:10,260 --> 07:11:11,840
Oh my god.

5792
07:11:15,810 --> 07:11:16,970
Oh, I thought...

5793
07:11:16,970 --> 07:11:17,270
Oh.

5794
07:11:17,990 --> 07:11:19,030
You know, I thought he would.

5795
07:11:19,230 --> 07:11:20,430
I honestly thought he would.

5796
07:11:22,790 --> 07:11:23,350
Oh.

5797
07:11:23,570 --> 07:11:24,550
That is not good.

5798
07:11:26,730 --> 07:11:27,250
Hello.

5799
07:11:32,670 --> 07:11:33,070
Rise!

5800
07:11:36,710 --> 07:11:38,450
I timed it incorrectly.

5801
07:11:40,570 --> 07:11:41,110
Oh my god.

5802
07:11:41,350 --> 07:11:42,050
He's gonna do a Beyblade.

5803
07:11:42,330 --> 07:11:43,330
He's gonna do the Beyblade.

5804
07:11:43,510 --> 07:11:44,430
We gotta save her.

5805
07:11:46,050 --> 07:11:47,450
Oh my god!

5806
07:11:47,690 --> 07:11:48,050
It's okay.

5807
07:11:48,170 --> 07:11:48,850
I believe in her.

5808
07:11:48,970 --> 07:11:52,570
I sacrificed myself to heal the Luna.

5809
07:11:53,090 --> 07:11:55,430
Because I knew the Luna is European.

5810
07:11:56,870 --> 07:12:15,010
And so the ping is on her side I save her Because I knew she's actually from EU So ping is on her side Because I ain't killing anybody I was not killing her Wait what?

5811
07:12:16,490 --> 07:12:22,950
Oh my god The push went off of my This is why I fucked this Actually fuck this

5812
07:12:26,150 --> 07:12:27,850
Okay, I got it.

5813
07:12:27,950 --> 07:12:30,390
I got it.

5814
07:12:30,390 --> 07:12:31,230
I got it.

5815
07:12:32,250 --> 07:12:34,510
Okay, Jesus, I hate Beyblade.

5816
07:12:36,150 --> 07:12:38,450
Oh my god, what happened?

5817
07:12:42,370 --> 07:12:45,830
I got, she had ping advantage.

5818
07:12:49,790 --> 07:13:28,570
Look, all I'm saying, if this was, if you were on my territory, it oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god okay there there you go Where am I?

5819
07:13:28,610 --> 07:13:30,050
Oh shit!

5820
07:13:32,890 --> 07:13:34,350
Okay, okay.

5821
07:13:34,670 --> 07:13:35,630
He got somebody.

5822
07:13:37,450 --> 07:13:39,150
She's a beautiful creature.

5823
07:13:39,930 --> 07:13:41,430
Oh, my poor guy.

5824
07:13:45,250 --> 07:13:46,010
There we go.

5825
07:13:46,650 --> 07:13:47,190
That.

5826
07:13:48,050 --> 07:13:49,270
Oh, nice.

5827
07:13:50,950 --> 07:13:51,690
Hopefully.

5828
07:13:52,650 --> 07:13:54,230
Look, I lived though.

5829
07:13:54,370 --> 07:13:55,230
I lived.

5830
07:13:56,170 --> 07:14:00,870
We don't Don't talk about the Adam of note, but I live.

5831
07:14:04,430 --> 07:14:07,610
We didn't ask to be heroes, but we always answer the call.

5832
07:14:07,610 --> 07:14:09,390
This is why I like him this more.

5833
07:14:11,710 --> 07:14:13,710
Yeah, rest in peace, Adam.

5834
07:14:14,270 --> 07:14:15,930
The mag was like, where is she?

5835
07:14:16,390 --> 07:14:19,130
And then he's like, oh, there's someone that can't walk today.

5836
07:14:20,610 --> 07:14:22,250
He fucking knocked this shins out.

5837
07:14:22,790 --> 07:14:23,490
Play for us.

5838
07:14:24,150 --> 07:14:25,410
You can try and combo Phoenix if you want.

5839
07:14:27,070 --> 07:14:31,310
I consider playing significantly less painful video games.

5840
07:14:31,610 --> 07:14:34,070
Look, at least I don't play league.

5841
07:14:38,510 --> 07:14:42,010
There's always a true...

5842
07:14:52,790 --> 07:14:56,270
Look, I could always go lower when you're lucky.

5843
07:15:02,070 --> 07:15:06,170
No, absolutely.

5844
07:15:07,210 --> 07:15:12,130
Bro, he's just...

5845
07:15:12,670 --> 07:15:13,150
Bro, I'm...

5846
07:15:13,610 --> 07:15:15,390
Bro, I'm just...

5847
07:15:15,390 --> 07:15:16,530
Oh, crap.

5848
07:15:20,290 --> 07:15:22,390
My tiny little...

5849
07:15:22,750 --> 07:15:23,710
Okay, I'm break.

5850
07:15:23,850 --> 07:15:24,350
I broke it.

5851
07:15:25,710 --> 07:15:25,810
Whoa.

5852
07:15:27,310 --> 07:15:29,870
Oh, my God.

5853
07:15:30,970 --> 07:15:33,210
Oh, my God.

5854
07:15:33,290 --> 07:15:35,890
I hope our Adam is somewhere very safe.

5855
07:15:37,070 --> 07:15:39,430
Oh, never mind.

5856
07:15:40,070 --> 07:15:43,370
He was absolutely not somewhere very...

5857
07:15:43,370 --> 07:15:46,610
Oh, very unfortunate.

5858
07:15:48,770 --> 07:15:51,870
Guys, he was not somewhere very safe.

5859
07:15:55,750 --> 07:15:56,990
Yeah, our Adam...

5860
07:15:57,010 --> 07:16:00,290
was, was, was not having it.

5861
07:16:02,830 --> 07:16:04,130
That's shit, bro.

5862
07:16:07,790 --> 07:16:08,810
Jesus, that was...

5863
07:16:10,630 --> 07:16:11,590
Do it.

5864
07:16:11,990 --> 07:16:12,790
Do it.

5865
07:16:12,850 --> 07:16:14,010
I'm gonna open with your rock, right?

5866
07:16:14,090 --> 07:16:14,810
Do it.

5867
07:16:14,950 --> 07:16:17,310
Oh, I didn't see you.

5868
07:16:18,570 --> 07:16:19,290
Don't be off.

5869
07:16:19,330 --> 07:16:21,150
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

5870
07:16:21,430 --> 07:16:23,150
Okay, okay, that was...

5871
07:16:30,630 --> 07:16:31,550
Hey, goodbye.

5872
07:16:32,090 --> 07:16:33,270
That, that, yeah.

5873
07:16:33,970 --> 07:16:35,910
That lag was crazy.

5874
07:16:38,590 --> 07:16:39,090
Yeah.

5875
07:16:39,790 --> 07:16:42,150
That was some crazy-ass lag right there.

5876
07:16:42,510 --> 07:16:43,570
I got to recharge my shield.

5877
07:16:44,950 --> 07:16:46,110
Oh my god, this is not good.

5878
07:16:46,310 --> 07:16:47,390
This is not good for me.

5879
07:16:47,850 --> 07:16:48,450
Why am I?

5880
07:16:49,270 --> 07:16:51,190
This one's saying it's so much harder.

5881
07:16:51,270 --> 07:16:56,390
It's definitely harder to push the Angela of this ping.

5882
07:16:57,110 --> 07:16:58,110
Oh my gosh, she's looking.

5883
07:16:58,690 --> 07:16:59,510
She's scouting.

5884
07:17:00,730 --> 07:17:02,750
She's like, where does she go?

5885
07:17:06,690 --> 07:17:08,350
Oh no, oh my god.

5886
07:17:08,350 --> 07:17:10,670
Oh my god.

5887
07:17:10,690 --> 07:17:12,530
Oh my god.

5888
07:17:12,530 --> 07:17:13,250
Oh my god.

5889
07:17:13,290 --> 07:17:15,970
Can you walk towards me and I'm not?

5890
07:17:16,530 --> 07:17:20,710
There we go.

5891
07:17:20,870 --> 07:17:23,670
It's okay, we're...

5892
07:17:23,670 --> 07:17:26,210
I feel safe.

5893
07:17:33,970 --> 07:17:35,850
I guess I'm by accident.

5894
07:17:38,610 --> 07:17:38,790
Okay.

5895
07:17:40,390 --> 07:17:41,370
All right, we got we saved.

5896
07:17:42,570 --> 07:17:45,950
That was very scary, guys.

5897
07:17:46,750 --> 07:17:51,630
That could have gone very wrong because I almost fucked up.

5898
07:17:53,070 --> 07:17:55,150
I almost killed someone.

5899
07:17:56,110 --> 07:17:57,670
You are nothing!

5900
07:17:58,310 --> 07:17:58,490
What?

5901
07:18:02,400 --> 07:18:03,940
Are you...

5902
07:18:07,600 --> 07:18:08,080
Okay.

5903
07:18:09,280 --> 07:18:09,760
Okay.

5904
07:18:10,320 --> 07:18:13,020
That was scary.

5905
07:18:13,680 --> 07:18:14,460
We all just...

5906
07:18:14,460 --> 07:18:16,400
All of us were just looking at it.

5907
07:18:16,860 --> 07:18:18,560
We're like, what's going on?

5908
07:18:18,580 --> 07:18:20,080
Fine, fine, fine.

5909
07:18:22,340 --> 07:18:23,300
Look, we just...

5910
07:18:23,960 --> 07:18:24,520
There we go.

5911
07:18:25,000 --> 07:18:25,900
I can't hold our attention.

5912
07:18:26,880 --> 07:18:27,080
Is that one?

5913
07:18:27,620 --> 07:18:28,120
Is that canceling?

5914
07:18:28,780 --> 07:18:30,880
Okay, I cannot cancel again.

5915
07:18:32,260 --> 07:18:33,000
I'm working on the map.

5916
07:18:34,000 --> 07:18:34,480
It's working on this.

5917
07:18:34,480 --> 07:18:34,760
It's working on this.

5918
07:18:35,740 --> 07:18:36,940
Jesus Christ.

5919
07:18:37,320 --> 07:18:38,640
Oh my god.

5920
07:18:40,400 --> 07:18:41,120
I...

5921
07:18:41,120 --> 07:18:47,220
I don't know how much more do you want me to do there.

5922
07:18:48,540 --> 07:18:49,340
There we go.

5923
07:18:49,900 --> 07:18:52,560
It was to a certain top of this.

5924
07:18:53,040 --> 07:18:54,880
I like how it just like...

5925
07:18:59,900 --> 07:19:01,680
Look, we gotta...

5926
07:19:01,680 --> 07:19:04,160
We gotta make sure that...

5927
07:19:04,760 --> 07:19:05,800
I'm sure it doesn't hit me.

5928
07:19:10,560 --> 07:19:15,400
I'll just like, what's going on?

5929
07:19:18,120 --> 07:19:20,500
Enjoy the nerfs, buddy.

5930
07:19:24,600 --> 07:19:27,240
End of season, Doom queue.

5931
07:19:28,860 --> 07:19:28,980
Bro.

5932
07:19:35,860 --> 07:19:36,000
What?

5933
07:19:36,580 --> 07:19:36,840
What?

5934
07:19:37,020 --> 07:19:37,060
What?

5935
07:19:37,140 --> 07:19:38,420
Is this?

5936
07:19:38,800 --> 07:19:40,340
What's going on?

5937
07:19:40,740 --> 07:19:41,140
Bro.

5938
07:19:41,360 --> 07:19:42,120
Europeans.

5939
07:19:42,660 --> 07:19:43,340
You, you, you.

5940
07:19:43,360 --> 07:19:44,320
Are you okay?

5941
07:19:45,480 --> 07:19:48,820
Um, are you okay?

5942
07:19:54,500 --> 07:19:59,640
No, the Bucky is like, question mark, question mark, question mark.

5943
07:20:04,460 --> 07:20:07,320
He's trying to say the Bucky.

5944
07:20:07,780 --> 07:20:09,680
He's like, trying to say the Bucky.

5945
07:20:10,140 --> 07:20:11,340
The gamer words.

5946
07:20:11,360 --> 07:20:13,820
Not the Bucky saying the gamer word.

5947
07:20:14,360 --> 07:20:16,740
Try to call him the gamer word.

5948
07:20:18,800 --> 07:20:20,780
Yeah, probably news, right?

5949
07:20:20,940 --> 07:20:22,080
News censored, right?

5950
07:20:25,100 --> 07:20:26,600
Oh my god.

5951
07:20:27,020 --> 07:20:28,740
Are you okay over there?

5952
07:20:37,290 --> 07:20:39,010
This has been my history.

5953
07:20:40,050 --> 07:20:42,070
It's been pretty rough.

5954
07:20:43,830 --> 07:20:45,090
This one was the roughest.

5955
07:20:46,630 --> 07:20:47,470
No, no.

5956
07:20:47,910 --> 07:20:53,670
The roughest was the one where I lost seven games in a row.

5957
07:20:54,030 --> 07:20:54,750
That's gone now.

5958
07:20:54,910 --> 07:20:55,750
It's off the record.

5959
07:20:57,510 --> 07:20:58,570
It's gone now.

5960
07:20:59,490 --> 07:21:00,910
It doesn't exist anymore.

5961
07:21:04,190 --> 07:21:06,010
It never happened.

5962
07:21:07,350 --> 07:21:09,310
It doesn't exist anymore.

5963
07:21:13,620 --> 07:21:14,520
Oh yeah, nice.

5964
07:21:14,660 --> 07:21:16,520
I wish I could keep that, but I can't.

5965
07:21:20,800 --> 07:21:21,280
Ugh.

5966
07:21:24,410 --> 07:21:27,850
You get now kisses from mom.

5967
07:21:29,490 --> 07:21:30,550
I want kisses.

5968
07:21:32,210 --> 07:21:32,830
Hello.

5969
07:21:33,450 --> 07:21:34,360
Jeff is here.

5970
07:21:37,850 --> 07:21:40,290
Hello fellow roleplayers.

5971
07:21:41,570 --> 07:21:42,770
Hello.

5972
07:21:45,270 --> 07:21:46,490
Hello.

5973
07:21:47,050 --> 07:21:47,250
Hello.

5974
07:21:47,250 --> 07:21:50,070
Where are the other Jeffs?

5975
07:21:50,090 --> 07:21:51,250
Hello Jeffs.

5976
07:21:52,550 --> 07:21:54,010
Evil Jeffs.

5977
07:21:54,030 --> 07:21:55,750
Which one is hello?

5978
07:21:57,470 --> 07:21:57,610
Hey.

5979
07:21:58,690 --> 07:21:59,110
Hey.

5980
07:22:01,630 --> 07:22:02,330
Whoa.

5981
07:22:02,770 --> 07:22:03,150
Hey.

5982
07:22:03,970 --> 07:22:03,970
Hello.

5983
07:22:06,930 --> 07:22:09,730
Oh, you killed me.

5984
07:22:10,410 --> 07:22:11,570
Oh, my god.

5985
07:22:11,790 --> 07:22:13,410
That will be...

5986
07:22:15,930 --> 07:22:17,370
Poor Jack.

5987
07:22:20,370 --> 07:22:21,910
I was...

5988
07:22:21,910 --> 07:22:24,170
I was like...

5989
07:22:24,170 --> 07:22:25,250
What's the word?

5990
07:22:28,650 --> 07:22:29,650
Oh.

5991
07:22:29,670 --> 07:22:33,130
I was like the bystander, a victim.

5992
07:22:34,050 --> 07:22:38,510
No honor among just invisible woman.

5993
07:22:41,590 --> 07:22:43,050
I was like a victim.

5994
07:22:44,090 --> 07:22:46,710
I literally just walked over and got kicked.

5995
07:22:56,130 --> 07:22:58,090
Oh, I'm in the East Coast now.

5996
07:22:58,590 --> 07:23:00,930
I'm back at the East Coast, baby.

5997
07:23:02,050 --> 07:23:03,850
Back at any lobby.

5998
07:23:05,410 --> 07:23:10,410
Guys, I know I said I'm going to fix my sleep schedule, but I don't know if I'm going to make it.

5999
07:23:10,430 --> 07:23:13,950
I guess I'm scared.

6000
07:23:14,290 --> 07:23:17,690
I don't think I don't know if I'm going to make it.

6001
07:23:19,810 --> 07:23:21,130
I'm feeling it now.

6002
07:23:23,390 --> 07:23:24,750
I'm actually feeling it.

6003
07:23:28,350 --> 07:23:30,150

6064
07:27:58,130 --> 07:27:59,810

07:28:00,970 --> 07:28:01,730

6125
07:35:17,040 --> 07:35:19,100
Three games in a row where there were throwers.

6126
07:35:19,240 --> 07:35:20,180

6127
07:35:21,660 --> 07:35:21,980

Why is she up so early?

6158
07:37:15,770 --> 07:37:17,070
That's so funny.

6159
07:37:17,690 --> 07:37:19,950

07:42:46,510 --> 07:42:46,950
Jeff is good.

6223
07:42:47,230 --> 07:42:47,550
Not gonna lie.

6224
07:42:47,770 --> 07:42:53,110
Jeff is good, but like it's not triple support Jeff Which is what I was scared about.

6225
07:42:53,770 --> 07:42:55,130
It's just regular Jeff

6226
07:42:58,610 --> 07:43:03,250
It's just regular Jeff and regular Jeff is less scary

6227
07:43:10,080 --> 07:43:11,450
Oh my god.

6228
07:43:19,130 --> 07:43:19,670

I would like her to heal so she can...

6238
07:43:53,560 --> 07:43:56,640
You can tell I'm not healing much because, like, I just want her to build up.

6239
07:43:58,360 --> 07:43:59,980
Because there's no reason for me.

6240
07:44:00,740 --> 07:44:02,320

07:48:01,090 --> 07:48:03,730
That was... I was very concerned.

6285
07:48:05,350 --> 07:48:07,310
Are you solo queuing?

6286
07:48:07,670 --> 07:48:08,630

6288
07:48:14,130 --> 07:48:16,150
He's talking about me.

6289
07:48:16,830 --> 07:48:18,510
I was gonna ask you to do it.

6290
07:48:20,110 --> 07:48:22,050

6291
07:48:31,530 --> 07:48:32,130

6292
07:48:39,370 --> 07:48:39,970
Bro,

6293
07:48:45,790 --> 07:48:48,550
he said he ain't a real homie, by the way.

6294
07:48:48,990 --> 07:48:50,350
That guy's not a homie.

6295
07:48:50,850 --> 07:48:52,390
Because he was like, yeah.

6296
07:48:53,090 --> 07:48:55,390
Like, he didn't care.

6297
07:48:57,230 --> 07:48:59,530
That guy, that guy ain't real.

6298
07:48:59,670 --> 07:49:02,210
That guy ain't a real homie.

6299
07:49:02,690 --> 07:49:07,230
See, if it's a real homie, he would be like, nah, bro.

6300
07:49:09,270 --> 07:49:11,670
Bros before hoes, you know?

6301
07:49:17,700 --> 07:49:19,620
Oh, the widow death goes crazy.

6302
07:49:19,960 --> 07:49:25,980
So, like, all I'm saying is that he ain't a real bro.

6303
07:49:27,300 --> 07:49:29,980
A real bro wouldn't let that happen.

6304
07:49:37,890 --> 07:49:38,530
Imagine.

6305
07:49:38,550 --> 07:49:39,850
Oh, he's dead.

6306
07:49:47,930 --> 07:49:52,270
You have way too many ads on Twitch.

6307
07:49:52,550 --> 07:49:53,910
I don't even run ads.

6308
07:49:55,210 --> 07:49:58,130
I don't even, guys, I don't even run ads.

6310
07:50:08,930 --> 07:50:09,790
That last one.

6311
07:50:09,910 --> 07:50:10,950
Now we can keep going.

6312
07:50:11,550 --> 07:50:12,990
that one was the last one.

6313
07:50:14,490 --> 07:50:15,850
Yeah, it's just Twitch beating Twitch.

6314
07:50:17,090 --> 07:50:19,410

Yeah, it's on Twitch's side.

6316
07:50:23,770 --> 07:50:24,710

All I did was ask Where are the ladies?

6363
07:52:28,600 --> 07:52:29,900
That ain't a crime.

6364
07:52:30,940 --> 07:52:33,820
That's not a crime to ask where the ladies are.

6365
07:52:38,720 --> 07:52:42,040
If that's a crime, then I don't want to be right.

6404
07:54:48,880 --> 07:54:51,320
The right heroes could make all the difference.

6405
07:54:51,580 --> 07:54:51,820
Okay.

6406
07:54:54,620 --> 07:54:55,720

Please don't make me play Luna.

6408
07:54:58,780 --> 07:55:00,580
Not on EU ping.

6409
07:55:02,140 --> 07:55:03,100
It's fine.

6410
07:55:03,860 --> 07:55:04,340
It's fine.

6411
07:55:07,910 --> 07:55:08,910
It's fine.

6412
07:55:10,930 --> 07:55:11,650
That's fine.

6413
07:55:13,750 --> 07:55:14,330
Maybe I will.

6414
07:55:14,450 --> 07:55:16,510
Maybe I'll do a late night stream on YouTube.

6415
07:55:16,990 --> 07:55:17,970
And it'll just be rival.

6416
07:55:20,830 --> 07:55:21,630
Just be...

6417
07:55:22,230 --> 07:55:23,030
Who knows?

6418
07:55:24,010 --> 07:55:25,430
I'll think about it.

6419
07:55:28,230 --> 07:55:30,490
This is a bit bad because we don't have a lot of heals.

6420
07:55:31,690 --> 07:55:32,170
I don't know.

6421
07:55:32,310 --> 07:55:33,110
I'll figure it out.

6422
07:55:33,350 --> 07:55:34,450

6423
07:55:36,150 --> 07:55:37,330

6485
08:01:27,480 --> 08:01:30,500

6503
08:03:35,590 --> 08:03:42,330
And if she gets that plus one, I should get that plus one too.

6504
08:03:48,980 --> 08:03:53,540
Yes, maybe I could have saved her if I ulted.

6505
08:03:54,420 --> 08:04:01,820
But maybe she could have saved me when she, I don't know, turned around and gave me a leap when I went, I need healing.

6506
08:04:03,820 --> 08:04:05,320
That's all I'm going to say.

6507
08:04:06,340 --> 08:04:07,140

That's fine.

6534
08:05:23,340 --> 08:05:23,780
That's fine.

6535
08:05:25,440 --> 08:05:25,920
That's okay.

6536
08:05:26,520 --> 08:05:27,600
Also, you don't have to push the card.

6537
08:05:27,780 --> 08:05:28,740
You see that it says auto.

6538
08:05:29,980 --> 08:05:34,180
So you can technically fight with your team for... Jesus Christ.

6539
08:05:35,640 --> 08:05:37,280
Who gets ult so fast?

6540
08:05:38,240 --> 08:05:40,720

6573
08:09:04,310 --> 08:09:05,590
It's just like Gamba.

6574
08:09:12,690 --> 08:09:13,770
For now.

6575
08:09:21,470 --> 08:09:21,930
Ow.

6576
08:09:22,930 --> 08:09:23,370
Ow.

6577
08:09:28,350 --> 08:09:29,950
Hello everybody.

6578
08:09:30,990 --> 08:09:31,690
Hello women.

6579
08:09:40,040 --> 08:09:41,720
I'm sorry!

6580
08:09:42,160 --> 08:09:43,160
I'm sorry!

6581
08:09:43,580 --> 08:09:45,700
He just smelled so good!

6582
08:09:52,380 --> 08:09:54,420
It's not my voice!

6583
08:09:55,120 --> 08:09:56,940
It smells so good!

6584
08:09:58,160 --> 08:09:59,400
Oh, he doesn't know.

6585
08:09:59,940 --> 08:10:00,840
He doesn't.

6586
08:10:01,380 --> 08:10:01,720
Ah!

6587
08:10:04,800 --> 08:10:05,880
It's so cute.

6588
08:10:06,280 --> 08:10:07,680
It's the bouncing game.

6589
08:10:07,700 --> 08:10:09,340
Get out of here!

6590
08:10:12,520 --> 08:10:16,120
How is I supposed to know it wasn't allowed?

6591
08:10:19,820 --> 08:10:23,820
I just... I'm just... I'm just a...

6592
08:10:25,020 --> 08:10:26,600
A shark darling!

6593
08:10:27,000 --> 08:10:28,140
What can I do?

6594
08:10:30,160 --> 08:10:32,140
I'm just like fad.

6595
08:10:32,520 --> 08:10:34,760
I'm fad from the club now.

6596
08:10:38,960 --> 08:11:08,040
I'm so sad they banned me from the club after one mistake how was I supposed to know it was a mistake huh how was I supposed to know I'm just a little guy don't make me angry don't make me angry I will play this game if you make me angry oh my god it's his girl it's his girl oh my god Wait,

6597
08:11:08,300 --> 08:11:10,200
how come they can do that?

6598
08:11:10,820 --> 08:11:10,940
Bro!

6599
08:11:11,160 --> 08:11:12,780
Oh my god, his name is Predator.

6600
08:11:13,320 --> 08:11:15,420
Oh my god, wait.

6601
08:11:17,540 --> 08:11:19,140
Which hero do you think you're gonna be in?

6602
08:11:19,140 --> 08:11:20,600
I just realized.

6603
08:11:20,800 --> 08:11:24,720
I'm not the type who faced quietly into the battleground.

6604
08:11:25,320 --> 08:11:26,700
Oh, it's dope.

6605
08:11:32,400 --> 08:11:35,300
Now, who are I going to be in this?

6606
08:11:37,700 --> 08:11:38,720
What do you mean?

6607
08:11:46,140 --> 08:11:47,140
Bye now!

6608
08:11:48,520 --> 08:11:50,460
Alright, stream ends.

6609
08:11:51,060 --> 08:11:54,020
We end when we lose.

6610
08:11:54,360 --> 08:11:56,100
It could be this game.

6611
08:11:57,880 --> 08:11:58,880
I hope it is.

6612
08:11:59,140 --> 08:12:01,320
I'm running on fumes right now.

6613
08:12:01,780 --> 08:12:04,300
I'm not supposed to be...

6614
08:12:04,300 --> 08:12:07,260
I didn't... I don't know, it does not feel like seven...

6615
08:12:07,260 --> 08:12:08,100
Not eight hours.

6616
08:12:08,580 --> 08:12:11,860
It really does not feel like eight hours for me.

6617
08:12:12,900 --> 08:12:15,940
Like, time passed by so fast when I play Rivals.

6618
08:12:19,650 --> 08:12:20,530
It really does.

6619
08:12:20,650 --> 08:12:21,390
I don't know how.

6620
08:12:24,310 --> 08:12:25,690
But thanks for cheering me up.

6621
08:12:25,830 --> 08:12:33,610
I had, like, you know, when I found out, you know, that while I, like, gave up the grind, I was so sad.

6622
08:12:33,910 --> 08:12:36,810
But definitely streaming this has...

6623
08:12:36,810 --> 08:12:38,270
Oh, you're such a whore.

6624
08:12:39,850 --> 08:12:41,410
You really are.

6625
08:12:44,410 --> 08:12:47,450
You're such a tort taking my Invis.

6626
08:12:48,990 --> 08:12:49,570
Fuck you.

6627
08:12:50,450 --> 08:12:53,770
Unless you're a pro, then like, that's understandable.

6628
08:12:54,190 --> 08:12:54,970
You can have her.

6629
08:12:55,170 --> 08:12:58,250
But if you're not, fuck you.

6630
08:12:59,590 --> 08:13:00,270
Hope we lose.

6631
08:13:00,410 --> 08:13:01,650
Okay, nah, I don't hope we lose.

6632
08:13:01,770 --> 08:13:02,670
In case, like, I get bad.

6633
08:13:02,770 --> 08:13:04,310
I do not actively throw.

6634
08:13:04,990 --> 08:13:09,230
But, like, if it does happen, I won't be sad about it.

6635
08:13:11,950 --> 08:13:13,490
If it does happen.

6636
08:13:13,510 --> 08:13:38,230

08:19:12,280 --> 08:19:13,020
Triple support.

6677
08:19:14,700 --> 08:19:15,400
The beta might.

6678
08:19:15,500 --> 08:19:16,560
It's so bad.

6679
08:19:16,760 --> 08:19:17,600

6680
08:19:18,740 --> 08:19:20,040
I hate playing against it.

6681
08:19:20,240 --> 08:19:21,960
And I hate playing with it.

6682
08:19:22,820 --> 08:19:25,620
There's no happiness for triple support.

6683
08:19:26,760 --> 08:19:29,140
I don't even think you can be happy.

6684
08:19:30,200 --> 08:19:44,600
I don't think you could be happy even playing it I legitimately think if we have triple support this would be so easy well not easy yet but this would be not as bad there you go

6685
08:19:49,280 --> 08:19:54,120
oh my god please this is so hard is this what do you mean?

6697
08:21:57,050 --> 08:21:58,910
We are playing up in our team.

I'm seeing my Luno all the way back.

6701
08:22:02,230 --> 08:22:04,710
We press Q and then we run up with Q instead of walking up.

6702
08:22:05,650 --> 08:22:07,550

He's a pure offline.

Look at the fucking coward he is.

6793
08:31:20,820 --> 08:31:21,780

Wait, actually, that must have been crazy.

6796
08:31:32,240 --> 08:31:33,300
What did that look like?

6797
08:31:34,440 --> 08:31:35,600
What did that?

6798
08:31:35,680 --> 08:31:36,780
Yeah, you can appear offline.

6799
08:31:37,780 --> 08:31:40,200
What did that look like on my own?

6800
08:31:43,730 --> 08:31:44,190
Okay.

6801
08:31:45,270 --> 08:31:46,150
That's me.

6802
08:31:46,310 --> 08:31:47,030
I'm hoping.

6803
08:31:48,350 --> 08:31:48,690
Recap.

6804
08:31:50,410 --> 08:31:50,730
Oh, wait.

6805
08:31:50,830 --> 08:31:52,050
How do I move this?

6806
08:31:56,030 --> 08:31:57,910
This looks so dumb.

6807
08:31:58,110 --> 08:31:58,830
Not gonna lie.

6808
08:31:59,470 --> 08:32:01,690
It must have looked so fucking dumb.

6809
08:32:02,510 --> 08:32:05,890
I was like, no!

6810
08:32:06,370 --> 08:32:07,690
Why did you explode?

6811
08:32:09,950 --> 08:32:11,570
And then he gave up.

6812
08:32:11,850 --> 08:32:13,430
And then I'm like, yay!

6813
08:32:14,770 --> 08:32:15,450
Yay!

6814
08:32:16,430 --> 08:32:19,210
And then I got another See, look at that.

6815
08:32:19,390 --> 08:32:20,310
I did that.

6816
08:32:21,390 --> 08:32:24,870
And then I got back on point because I didn't want to see that.

6817
08:32:26,130 --> 08:32:27,630
And then I climbed back.

6818
08:32:28,850 --> 08:32:30,130
Look at me go.

6819
08:32:32,590 --> 08:32:33,670
That's crazy.

6820
08:32:34,270 --> 08:32:36,330
That's actually I did not deserve.

6821
08:32:36,670 --> 08:32:38,930
I'm just surprised I won that.

6822
08:32:39,090 --> 08:32:41,090
Chiru, do you think you want to be today?

6823
08:32:42,550 --> 08:32:42,970
Okay.

6824
08:32:43,430 --> 08:32:45,150
Oh, we have a raccoon now.

6825
08:32:46,030 --> 08:32:47,730
I got two reses off.

6826
08:32:47,750 --> 08:32:50,590
I got

6827
08:32:55,890 --> 08:32:56,870
two reses.

6828
08:32:57,070 --> 08:32:58,230
I didn't get one.

6829
08:32:59,170 --> 08:33:00,760
You don't want to ban Ultron first.

6830
08:33:15,560 --> 08:33:17,760
Rocket just won 1v9.

6831
08:33:18,580 --> 08:33:19,660
I didn't avoid anything.

6832
08:33:21,100 --> 08:33:22,520
Oh no, that's Rigsie.

6833
08:33:24,600 --> 08:33:27,520
You still complain when we win.

6834
08:33:30,740 --> 08:33:33,420
You're just low E low.

6835
08:33:34,980 --> 08:33:35,540
Holy shit.

6836
08:33:35,840 --> 08:33:43,720
If this guy is a pro, if this guy is a pro, he's going to be so embarrassed knowing that this shit was out broadcast.

6837
08:33:51,940 --> 08:33:54,300
And seeing everybody in my chat blaming him.

6838
08:33:56,240 --> 08:33:57,240
Weak-ass mental.

6839
08:34:00,160 --> 08:34:04,040
No, pro players have fucking weak mental.

6840
08:34:05,160 --> 08:34:05,940
They have such...

6841
08:34:05,940 --> 08:34:10,600
That's why, like, you know, like so many pro players and rank grinders have such...

6842
08:34:10,600 --> 08:34:11,620
Like, including me.

6843
08:34:11,720 --> 08:34:14,220
Get off rocket.

6844
08:34:22,000 --> 08:34:22,720
Bro!

6845
08:34:26,660 --> 08:34:28,760
We got the thrower.

6846
08:34:31,300 --> 08:34:32,680
Let him just let him.

6847
08:34:33,040 --> 08:34:33,860
Just let him play.

6848
08:34:35,780 --> 08:34:37,020
It's still winnable.

6849
08:34:38,580 --> 08:34:39,740
Wait, are you complaining about rocket?

6850
08:34:40,740 --> 08:34:41,180
Get ready.

6851
08:34:41,880 --> 08:34:43,520
Are you serious?

6852
08:34:45,460 --> 08:34:46,980
Oh my god.

6853
08:34:48,820 --> 08:34:50,520
What a game to end on.

6854
08:34:51,420 --> 08:34:53,860
What a game to end on.

6855
08:34:57,500 --> 08:34:58,260
Okay, they swapped it.

6856
08:35:01,140 --> 08:35:02,000
Okay, yeah, yeah.

6857
08:35:02,880 --> 08:35:04,180
Rocket is actually...

6858
08:35:04,180 --> 08:35:06,380
I think Rocket is...

6859
08:35:06,380 --> 08:35:08,020
Rocket is actually better than Cloak.

6860
08:35:08,720 --> 08:35:10,900
Rocket is actually... Oh my god.

6861
08:35:11,180 --> 08:35:12,680
Bro, this guy's fucking stupid.

6862
08:35:13,380 --> 08:35:14,680
Rocket is better than Cloak.

6863
08:35:15,280 --> 08:35:15,740
Holy shit.

6864
08:35:15,840 --> 08:35:17,020
Are you fucking stupid?

6865
08:35:17,740 --> 08:35:19,800
I would rather have a rocket than a Cloak.

6866
08:35:20,320 --> 08:35:20,940
I...

6867
08:35:20,940 --> 08:35:21,860
Yeah.

6868
08:35:22,320 --> 08:35:24,420
Like, you're actually fucking stupid.

6869
08:35:24,640 --> 08:35:25,740
If you...

6870
08:35:25,740 --> 08:35:27,220
Oh my god.

6871
08:35:28,020 --> 08:35:29,000
They have a Black Widow.

6872
08:35:31,260 --> 08:35:32,320
I literally...

6873
08:35:33,220 --> 08:35:37,840
I'm not playing Cloak with magic door.

6874
08:35:39,140 --> 08:35:40,140
Yeah, Luna's welcome.

6875
08:35:41,760 --> 08:35:42,380
No.

6876
08:35:42,600 --> 08:35:43,320
Luna's even worse.

Oh my god.

6883
08:36:50,270 --> 08:36:53,850
What the f- Oh, you're into that loser who always tries to be on top 500 and never makes it.

6884
08:36:53,890 --> 08:36:55,830

6885
08:36:56,250 --> 08:36:56,270
Who?

Okay, they're up top.

6887
08:36:57,510 --> 08:36:58,370
Every season, real game.

6888
08:36:59,190 --> 08:37:00,190
Okay, they have captain.

6889
08:37:00,370 --> 08:37:01,030
You play rock.

6890
08:37:01,550 --> 08:37:02,690
Because you're bad at the game and lucky.

6891
08:37:03,630 --> 08:37:06,690
What the f- Because everyone is standing up the game.

6892
08:37:06,970 --> 08:37:08,850
What is going on?

6893
08:37:09,710 --> 08:37:11,110
Oh my god!

6894
08:37:11,190 --> 08:37:11,570
Doki can die.

6895
08:37:12,030 --> 08:37:13,950
We are undefeatable!

6896
08:37:14,910 --> 08:37:16,190
Captain one, nice!

6897
08:37:16,670 --> 08:37:18,230
Okay, the mantis drop.

Help our phoenix.

Nice.

08:37:26,350 --> 08:37:27,930
I'm trying my best.

6902
08:37:28,290 --> 08:37:28,710
Oh, yes.

6903
08:37:32,230 --> 08:37:33,490
Oh my god.

6904
08:37:34,530 --> 08:37:38,430
Okay, three or four people have copied over here.

6905
08:37:39,630 --> 08:37:40,710
Spider-Man coming right side.

6906
08:37:42,030 --> 08:37:42,270
Coming?

6907
08:37:42,610 --> 08:37:42,850
Come back?

6908
08:37:43,010 --> 08:37:43,730
Are you Spider-Man or are you?

6909
08:37:44,310 --> 08:37:46,850
Don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man!

6910
08:37:47,230 --> 08:37:47,290
Buddy!

6911
08:37:47,790 --> 08:37:48,670
Please, please, please, please!

6912
08:37:48,990 --> 08:37:49,110
Oh!

6913
08:37:49,330 --> 08:37:50,090
I shot him here.

6914
08:37:50,750 --> 08:37:52,050
I thought he was gonna ult!

6915
08:37:52,190 --> 08:37:52,970
These runes.

6916
08:37:54,730 --> 08:37:55,410
Who's ult?

6917
08:37:55,490 --> 08:37:56,590
Okay, I'm ulting for you.

6918
08:37:57,510 --> 08:37:58,730
Let's not press the Pro.

6919
08:37:58,730 --> 08:37:59,690
I don't give up so easily.

6920
08:38:00,190 --> 08:38:02,210
I thought the Rock is gonna ult.

6921
08:38:02,250 --> 08:38:03,750
See how I'm pointing his mind looks good.

6922
08:38:05,650 --> 08:38:06,130
Okay.

6923
08:38:06,810 --> 08:38:07,930
Oh my god.

6924
08:38:09,270 --> 08:38:11,810

There you go.

08:38:42,390 --> 08:38:43,330
I support all of this.

6930
08:38:45,110 --> 08:38:46,430
Nigel's alone here with me.

6931
08:38:46,690 --> 08:38:47,730
There's one.

6932
08:38:48,310 --> 08:38:48,330
Yeah.

6933
08:38:49,190 --> 08:38:49,590
Why?

6934
08:38:50,730 --> 08:38:51,010
What?

6935
08:38:51,170 --> 08:38:51,430
What?

6936
08:38:51,850 --> 08:38:53,550
No, you are slow shit.

6937
08:38:54,490 --> 08:38:55,710
Look at cap.

6938
08:38:56,250 --> 08:38:58,290
Bro, no one's shooting you.

6939
08:38:58,430 --> 08:39:00,990
The cap is jumping around, just stalling and you press Q.

6940
08:39:01,430 --> 08:39:03,110
Like, you cannot be real.

6941
08:39:03,210 --> 08:39:03,530
What?

6942
08:39:05,130 --> 08:39:09,350
Bro, okay, this rocket was pretty stupid for doing that.

6943
08:39:11,050 --> 08:39:15,290
Like, he was pretty stupid for that.

6944
08:39:15,570 --> 08:39:17,070
He did not have to up that.

6945
08:39:18,810 --> 08:39:20,630
He actually did not.

6946
08:39:26,890 --> 08:39:28,170
Where's my rocket?

6947
08:39:29,270 --> 08:39:31,210
Where is my rocket?

6948
08:39:31,430 --> 08:39:31,790

Oh my god, couldn't get out.

6954
08:40:08,290 --> 08:40:08,830

08:40:10,770 --> 08:40:11,870
Maybe it's fighting, fighting one.

6956
08:40:12,630 --> 08:40:13,510
Fighting one, fighting one.

6957
08:40:16,390 --> 08:40:16,990
Cap half.

6958
08:40:17,430 --> 08:40:18,430
Guys, guys, just can't just be right.

6959
08:40:20,830 --> 08:40:22,150
Oh, this is unlucky.

6960
08:40:23,170 --> 08:40:24,530
Oh my god, stop fucking again.

6961
08:40:24,810 --> 08:40:25,650
Holy shit.

6962
08:40:25,790 --> 08:40:26,170
Very close.

6963
08:40:26,830 --> 08:40:27,410
Fighting one.

6964
08:40:27,510 --> 08:40:27,810
Be careful.

6965
08:40:28,390 --> 08:40:29,390
What are you looking at?

6966
08:40:29,910 --> 08:40:31,430

He keeps running away from me

6973
08:41:25,010 --> 08:41:26,770
He keeps running away from me.

6974
08:41:26,930 --> 08:41:28,050
I can't play with him

6975
08:41:35,870 --> 08:41:51,390
No, it's just this guy's an asshole After all these years, this guy's an actual asshole Let me out this is one I'll just have to feel more, I guess, so I don't know.

6976
08:41:51,390 --> 08:41:53,010
Oh, my support to our actual AI.

6977
08:41:53,170 --> 08:41:53,870
I was a portal.

6978
08:41:54,210 --> 08:41:55,050
I feel you guys.

6979
08:41:55,150 --> 08:41:57,910
I stopped their ult, and somehow we still just can't play the game.

6980
08:41:58,090 --> 08:41:59,070
Like, it's all...

6981
08:41:59,070 --> 08:42:00,030
I pick up a healer.

6982
08:42:00,110 --> 08:42:02,450
I stopped their ult, and somehow you guys are just not pressing Q.

6983
08:42:03,390 --> 08:42:03,650
What?

6984
08:42:03,830 --> 08:42:04,790
I guess we're really good at the game.

6985
08:42:05,290 --> 08:42:06,710
It's because our rocket's getting up.

6986
08:42:06,990 --> 08:42:09,350
I was waiting for our rocket to ult.

6987
08:42:09,370 --> 08:42:10,150
They're actually talented.

6988
08:42:10,770 --> 08:42:11,530
Can you tell...

6989
08:42:11,530 --> 08:42:11,930
I'm just going to...

6990
08:42:11,930 --> 08:42:13,970
Can you tell our rocket to ult first?

6991
08:42:15,050 --> 08:42:18,030
I've just been waiting for him, and he holds it.

6992
08:42:18,450 --> 08:42:19,390
And he holds it.

6993
08:42:19,410 --> 08:42:46,110
and somehow we lose the fight because my background is not even worth one eating bro this guy is actually so fucking cringe i told you pro like if he's pro or if he's a high ranker they have the weakest fucking mental it's actually this is all they have this is actually all they have in life but you say nothing useful bro this is all they have in life

6994
08:42:49,410 --> 08:42:50,730
I saved my back plan.

6995
08:42:50,790 --> 08:42:54,150
I killed his back plan and somehow we lose the fight because my future actually.

6996
08:42:54,930 --> 08:42:54,930
Yeah.

6997
08:42:55,730 --> 08:42:56,270
Holy shit.

6998
08:42:56,570 --> 08:42:57,810
These guys, this guy.

6999
08:42:58,290 --> 08:43:00,430
Yeah, he has to be so shit at the end so much.

7000
08:43:00,710 --> 08:43:01,710
He can't.

7001
08:43:02,350 --> 08:43:04,170
It's actually, I'll play one more.

7002
08:43:04,990 --> 08:43:05,970
I'll play one more.

7003
08:43:06,150 --> 08:43:06,310
I get it.

7004
08:43:06,490 --> 08:43:09,070
You're trying to boost the images, but like the game is not winnable.

7005
08:43:10,550 --> 08:43:11,430
Holy shit.

7006
08:43:11,670 --> 08:43:13,590
You're thinking about, you say nothing useful.

7007
08:43:14,530 --> 08:43:15,970
Oh my god.

7008
08:43:16,210 --> 08:43:17,930
No, brother, get on mag.

7009
08:43:18,110 --> 08:43:18,890
I promise you.

7010
08:43:19,410 --> 08:43:21,010
Message the devs about this guy too.

7011
08:43:24,050 --> 08:43:27,970
I don't think he cares about this account anyway.

7012
08:43:28,250 --> 08:43:30,290
But I can message the devs about this account.

7013
08:43:30,830 --> 08:43:31,190
About it.

7014
08:43:31,330 --> 08:43:32,610
And show them the...

7015
08:43:32,610 --> 08:43:34,070
I'm not trying to play all day.

7016
08:43:34,090 --> 08:43:35,030
I'm trying to win the 8 times in a row.

7017
08:43:35,250 --> 08:43:37,170
I don't know.

7018
08:43:42,570 --> 08:43:43,450
That's crazy.

7019
08:43:50,500 --> 08:43:52,040
That's actually crazy.

7020
08:43:59,130 --> 08:44:00,990
That's fucking crazy.

7021
08:44:01,330 --> 08:44:02,770
Just wait, we should keep dodged this.

7022
08:44:03,370 --> 08:44:05,010
This guy is so fucking cringe.

7023
08:44:05,230 --> 08:44:06,310
He actually is.

7024
08:44:06,790 --> 08:44:09,210
He actually is so cringe.

7025
08:44:09,950 --> 08:44:14,170
You play solo, you're still behind him probably.

7026
08:44:14,990 --> 08:44:16,150
Holy shit.

7027
08:44:19,030 --> 08:44:21,910
I never said anything to this guy.

7028
08:44:23,630 --> 08:44:24,470
What the?

7029
08:44:24,930 --> 08:44:25,710
What the fuck?

7030
08:44:25,970 --> 08:44:28,370
That's not that deep.

7031
08:44:29,470 --> 08:44:30,470
It's been about this guy.

7032
08:44:31,270 --> 08:44:33,090
I'll just message devs about this guy.

7033
08:44:33,670 --> 08:44:35,410
I didn't even fucking say shit.

7034
08:44:35,950 --> 08:44:36,870
Oh, maybe he's watching stream.

7035
08:44:37,170 --> 08:44:38,790
Guys, say shit about this guy.

7036
08:44:39,130 --> 08:44:40,190
Maybe he's watching the stream.

7037
08:44:40,710 --> 08:44:42,210
Give us your thoughts about this guy.

7038
08:44:43,290 --> 08:44:46,030
Tell him about how he's gonna amount to nothing.

7039
08:44:46,470 --> 08:44:48,430
Because this is the only thing he has.

7040
08:44:50,890 --> 08:44:53,450
Being high, Elo is the only thing he has.

7041
08:44:54,930 --> 08:44:58,690
He is making zero money playing this game

7042
08:45:02,390 --> 08:45:05,610
Bro shower dude bro shower

7043
08:45:12,610 --> 08:45:23,990
Bro keeps yapping small pee-pee energy right there Bro, I don't even think he's he has ever had a girlfriend this guy is like sexist as hell.

7044
08:45:24,290 --> 08:45:27,810
There's no one A girl would ever let him fuck her.

7045
08:45:28,690 --> 08:45:30,650
He would have to pay her to fuck her.

7046
08:45:33,770 --> 08:45:34,830
All he has is...

7047
08:45:34,830 --> 08:45:36,370
That's the wildest thing.

7048
08:45:36,810 --> 08:45:38,810
All he has is this game.

7049
08:45:40,030 --> 08:45:41,230
That's crazy.

7050
08:45:42,910 --> 08:45:43,790
He dodged this.

7051
08:45:45,390 --> 08:45:46,910
He dodged this.

7052
08:45:46,990 --> 08:45:48,930
I'll report this guy to the...

7053
08:45:53,690 --> 08:45:54,910
Nah, just cue this.

7054
08:45:54,930 --> 08:45:55,370
dodge.

7055
08:45:56,490 --> 08:45:57,150
It's easier.

7056
08:45:59,490 --> 08:46:02,870
Because he'll just try his ass out.

7057
08:46:04,990 --> 08:46:06,190
His ass out.

7058
08:46:06,690 --> 08:46:08,010
If he sees us.

7059
08:46:11,490 --> 08:46:13,410
That's crazy.

7060
08:46:15,850 --> 08:46:16,670
Report player.

7061
08:46:16,850 --> 08:46:17,830
Negative behavior.

7062
08:46:18,590 --> 08:46:19,070
Throwing.

7063
08:46:20,390 --> 08:46:20,430
Um.

7064
08:46:21,090 --> 08:46:22,530
Was throwing.

7065
08:46:23,030 --> 08:46:23,750
A game.

7066
08:46:23,970 --> 08:46:24,570
That was.

7067
08:46:24,930 --> 08:46:37,790
winnable and was throwing game swapped to be oh my god and i'm like the number one streamer and robber i was right now what a loser actually

7069
08:48:15,010 --> 08:48:54,610
I message them about it that's why they're private profile because they know actual fucking weirdo actual weirdo never even fucking said anything to this guy you know what's crazy oh i think it's because like if i when i queue up maybe if he knows me from like if he knows me actually from other me playing with other pros he must have not said shit because he knows the pros will recognize his voice.

7070
08:48:55,950 --> 08:48:57,470
I'll just send the voice clip over.

7071
08:48:58,590 --> 08:49:02,010
Because, like, he was like, oh, like, he kept going at it at me.

7072
08:49:02,570 --> 08:49:06,550
And, like, being like, oh, trying to get boosted or whatever.

7073
08:49:06,770 --> 08:49:07,670
And I was like, what?

7074
08:49:09,410 --> 08:49:10,530
I think maybe.

7075
08:49:10,930 --> 08:49:15,530
If he does know who I am, I can just send this clip to some of my pro friends.

7076
08:49:15,630 --> 08:49:16,610
Like, do you recognize his voice?

7077
08:49:17,150 --> 08:49:18,690
This guy's being a fucking asshole.

7078
08:49:20,990 --> 08:49:21,590
Yeah.

7079
08:49:22,710 --> 08:49:26,270
It's like, I've never had someone that go went that hardcore on me before.

7080
08:49:26,810 --> 08:49:27,870
I was just like, whoa.

7081
08:49:28,550 --> 08:49:29,910
Are you okay, buddy?

7082
08:49:30,490 --> 08:49:39,150
Like, bro, does your life really suck that much that you feel like something by flaming random people online?

7083
08:49:40,030 --> 08:49:49,730
Like, so he might know me because I play with, like, I play with, like, two pros sometimes, off stream.

7084
08:49:50,590 --> 08:49:54,230
And then he doesn't want to say shit when I'm with them.

7085
08:49:56,980 --> 08:49:57,440
Oh, yeah.

7086
08:50:01,020 --> 08:50:02,560
Okay, you can kill.

7087
08:50:25,510 --> 08:50:26,870
Yeah, no, that's what I'm saying.

7088
08:50:27,150 --> 08:50:28,490
These guys have...

7089
08:50:28,490 --> 08:50:30,370
I mean, I have, like, weak mental.

7090
08:50:30,550 --> 08:50:31,090
Because when I...

7091
08:50:31,090 --> 08:50:32,810
Like I said, I was, like, really sad.

7092
08:50:33,010 --> 08:50:33,930
When I...

7093
08:50:34,390 --> 08:50:38,710
I was really sad when I was, like, when I couldn't make it.

7094
08:50:39,710 --> 08:50:41,030
Because I was so close.

7095
08:50:41,490 --> 08:50:44,010
But, like, I would never say anything in...

7096
08:50:44,790 --> 08:51:07,470
I would never say anything in a public chat because like you know that's like that's just too far you know I would just say it to myself yeah he picked a fight with four supports yeah or maybe he got dropped I don't know maybe this guy got dropped from a team and he fucking can't even get on a pro team or some shit

7097
08:51:22,850 --> 08:51:49,450
maybe he got teams get dropped for taxes no players get dropped for toxicity um well most majority of them unless you're a really really good player then they'll just you know pretend that never happened that's usually it usually they do but unless they're really really really good then like they pretend it never happened It'll be like,

7098
08:51:49,630 --> 08:51:51,090
it got investigated.

7099
08:51:51,810 --> 08:51:54,490
Don't worry, an investigation is happening.

7100
08:51:55,010 --> 08:51:56,710
And then nothing comes out of it.

7101
08:51:56,830 --> 08:52:05,570
I'm not like saying it's Marvel Rivals, but it's like overall, like any esport, it's always like that.

7102
08:52:05,830 --> 08:52:14,490
They're like really, unless, unless, unless it's the really bad one, unless they do a really, really bad thing.

7103
08:52:15,010 --> 08:52:18,290
Because like, you know, there were some Overwatch League pros.

7104
08:52:18,370 --> 08:52:32,690
like disappeared because they did a really really bad thing but if it's like minor-ish like not as that bad then like usually they'll just pretend it didn't happen

7105
08:52:52,290 --> 08:53:29,730
yeah it's actually yeah but no i've been in playing rank for so long uh i've been playing rank for so long that like i know that these people have the weakest as hell oh my gosh wait why this is not okay this is i wrote we should have just we should have just q dodged because what the is this average la

7106
08:53:43,730 --> 08:53:51,050
what the there were gm players knew it i knew i should have just q dash

7107
08:53:55,390 --> 08:53:58,990
i should have so much energy after that

7108
08:54:03,670 --> 08:54:09,470
i i can keep going now after that that gave me so much energy

7109
08:54:13,330 --> 08:54:24,540
anger actually fueled me holy like i i i that's not my second one it's my third win you'll

7110
08:54:34,740 --> 08:54:41,000
need a top match team to win this one i'm luna snow Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

7111
08:54:42,200 --> 08:54:45,060
Yeah, no, anger is most definitely a good motivator.

7112
08:54:49,140 --> 08:54:49,620
100%.

7113
08:55:03,490 --> 08:55:05,410
Alright, this is...

7114
08:55:06,070 --> 08:55:06,850
Wait, am I Luna?

7115
08:55:07,170 --> 08:55:08,070
Did I accidentally pick Luna?

7116
08:55:08,290 --> 08:55:09,150
Wait, I don't want to play Luna.

7117
08:55:11,370 --> 08:55:11,570
Okay.

7118
08:55:12,410 --> 08:55:13,710
I don't want to play Luna.

7119
08:55:15,790 --> 08:55:16,270
Fuck.

7120
08:55:16,550 --> 08:55:17,950
Okay, I might actually...

7121
08:55:18,810 --> 08:55:20,950
I was thinking about playing Luna.

7122

Oh my god, not the fucking Namur.

08:56:06,310 --> 08:56:07,270
It's Namur.

7127
08:56:09,450 --> 08:56:10,710
It's Namur.

7128
08:56:14,500 --> 08:56:15,340
Namur.

7129
08:56:16,460 --> 08:56:17,000

Yay!

7134
08:56:27,520 --> 08:56:28,000
They're in it.

7135
08:56:28,180 --> 08:56:28,340
Oh.

7136
08:56:32,000 --> 08:56:33,260
Are you serious?

7137
08:56:33,900 --> 08:56:35,300
Jeff, please.

7138
08:56:36,200 --> 08:56:37,400
All right, I'm watching this.

7139
08:56:38,960 --> 08:56:39,680
Okay, that's my bedroom.

7140
08:56:41,040 --> 08:56:42,940
Okay, yeah, you're fucking good.

7141
08:56:43,500 --> 08:56:44,420
Are you serious?

7142
08:56:45,640 --> 08:56:46,000
Okay.

7143
08:56:47,360 --> 08:56:47,960
It's fine.

7144
08:56:49,760 --> 08:56:51,400
I had no clap, so like...

7145
08:56:56,180 --> 08:56:57,160
It's fine.

7146
08:56:57,280 --> 08:56:58,600
I had no...

7147
08:56:58,600 --> 08:57:00,100
Look, I had no

7148
08:57:04,300 --> 08:57:05,640
They're not portaling?

7149
08:57:06,720 --> 08:57:07,120
Oh, they're not.

7150
08:57:07,800 --> 08:57:08,540
That's interesting.

7151
08:57:09,540 --> 08:57:10,220
What the fuck?

7152
08:57:11,660 --> 08:57:12,860
I swear I heard...

7153
08:57:12,860 --> 08:57:13,620
Okay, there it is.

7154
08:57:13,720 --> 08:57:15,400
I was like, what was that sound?

7155
08:57:17,480 --> 08:57:18,480
Okay, remember...

7156
08:57:18,480 --> 08:57:20,180
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

7157
08:57:21,160 --> 08:57:21,560
Oh, my...

7158
08:57:21,560 --> 08:57:22,420
I'm not using anything.

7159
08:57:22,560 --> 08:57:23,040
I'm not.

7160
08:57:23,220 --> 08:57:25,040
There's no way I'm wasting out here.

7161
08:57:26,180 --> 08:57:27,840
Like, it's spawned.

7162
08:57:28,740 --> 08:57:29,860
It's the third lady.

7163
08:57:30,100 --> 08:57:31,220
They wasted up.

7164
08:57:31,720 --> 08:57:32,920
It's literally spawn.

7165
08:57:34,020 --> 08:57:35,200
Oh, that's unlucky.

7166
08:57:35,520 --> 08:57:36,580
He did stagger, though.

7167
08:57:36,860 --> 08:57:38,420
That one was not good.

7168
08:57:39,940 --> 08:57:42,220
That was not good that he staggered there.

7169
08:57:45,980 --> 08:57:51,040
It was almost okay until he started staggering.

7170
08:57:51,280 --> 08:57:54,220
Okay, the thing is, I have no clap, so if he...

7171
08:57:54,220 --> 08:57:56,120
I am ready to put on a show.

7172
08:57:56,320 --> 08:57:59,580
Alright, if he does all of this, I will have to...

7173
08:58:00,100 --> 08:58:01,250
Because I don't have clap.

7174
08:58:05,160 --> 08:58:06,720
Oh, this sucks.

7175
08:58:09,340 --> 08:58:11,080
Oh my god.

7176
08:58:11,600 --> 08:58:13,100
They're gonna...

7177
08:58:14,840 --> 08:58:15,200
Oh.

7178
08:58:16,920 --> 08:58:17,520
Nice.

7179
08:58:19,440 --> 08:58:19,840
Uh.

7180
08:58:21,620 --> 08:58:23,720
That was very scary.

7181
08:58:24,240 --> 08:58:25,060
Not gonna lie.

7182
08:58:26,340 --> 08:58:26,780
Wait.

7183
08:58:26,980 --> 08:58:27,480
Oh my god.

7184
08:58:27,620 --> 08:58:28,040
Oh my god.

7185
08:58:28,200 --> 08:58:28,840
I'm...

7186
08:58:28,840 --> 08:58:29,660
Oh my god.

7187
08:58:30,100 --> 08:58:33,930
The fucking dragon turtle lagged me.

7188
08:58:36,060 --> 08:58:37,200
All right, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

7189
08:58:37,400 --> 08:58:38,200
Thank you, thank you.

7190
08:58:43,080 --> 08:58:43,380
Yeah.

7191
08:58:47,020 --> 08:58:47,600
Yeah.

7192
08:58:49,900 --> 08:58:53,300
Okay, this guy most definitely has health ball, and I'm scared.

7193
08:58:53,720 --> 08:58:54,760
There it is.

7194
08:58:56,320 --> 08:58:56,940
There it is.

7195
08:58:57,200 --> 08:58:57,740
Oh, nice.

7196
08:58:58,220 --> 08:58:59,160
Oh, not nice.

7197
08:58:59,520 --> 08:58:59,880
Oh, don't.

7198
08:59:00,040 --> 08:59:01,960
Oh, oh, I'm okay.

7199
08:59:02,580 --> 08:59:03,620
Not okay.

7200
08:59:03,760 --> 08:59:04,840
I'm not okay.

7201
08:59:06,020 --> 08:59:06,420
It's okay.

7202
08:59:06,500 --> 08:59:07,280
We cap point.

7203
08:59:07,780 --> 08:59:08,720
We cap point.

7204
08:59:11,980 --> 08:59:14,180
I was not okay, but like, it's okay.

7205
08:59:14,280 --> 08:59:15,100
We cap point.

7206
08:59:16,080 --> 08:59:17,280
That's all that matters.

7207
08:59:21,890 --> 08:59:23,150
Like, is he still there?

7208
08:59:24,270 --> 08:59:25,610
Okay, he's not there anymore.

7209
08:59:26,130 --> 08:59:26,950
That's good.

7210
08:59:27,970 --> 08:59:28,290
Whoa!

7211
08:59:28,630 --> 08:59:29,110
Not good.

7212
08:59:29,450 --> 08:59:29,590
Not good.

7213
08:59:29,790 --> 08:59:30,710
Not good.

7214
08:59:30,850 --> 08:59:31,250
Not good.

7215
08:59:31,810 --> 08:59:32,550
Not good.

7216
08:59:32,690 --> 08:59:33,130
Not good.

7217
08:59:33,410 --> 08:59:33,850
Not good.

7218
08:59:33,850 --> 08:59:33,890
Not good.

7219
08:59:33,990 --> 08:59:35,990
No longer good.

7220
08:59:43,730 --> 08:59:45,450
It's okay, it's okay.

7253
09:03:52,580 --> 09:03:53,420
What's the occasion?

7254
09:03:53,640 --> 09:03:54,800
I'm trying to set my sleep schedule.

7255
09:03:55,400 --> 09:03:57,100
And also, like, I like playing right.

7256
09:03:57,180 --> 09:03:58,160
I like streaming rivals.

7257
09:03:58,740 --> 09:03:59,340
It's fun.

7258
09:03:59,760 --> 09:04:01,540
Including which side you're on.

7259
09:04:02,920 --> 09:04:05,960
Also, the, like, that loser.

7260
09:04:06,800 --> 09:04:10,200
That loser reignited my adrenaline.

7261
09:04:10,500 --> 09:04:12,280
I was tired, but I'm not tired anymore.

7262
09:04:14,820 --> 09:04:48,170
hey um organ thank you for the twitch prime thank you thank you infinite thank you for the twitch prime thank you thank you i'm trying to fix my sleep schedule because i need to fix it before my business trip because i'm still being a na i'm not like flying overseas or anything because then you know my fucked up sleep schedule would be perfect if i was flying overseas but i'll still be an na so i'm trying to fix it before before my business trip because i have to be awake in the morning

7263
09:04:53,470 --> 09:05:46,930
but yeah like i'm trying also that i think i'm getting better at handling like assholes in rank because in the past when i used to uh when i wasn't a streamer and i had like you know assholes it's why i don't use voice chat anymore too i don't use voice chat anymore because like I got back then in Overwatch there was not a lot of female high rank players and people were so fucking mean and like I would like cry every time I get flame but like I think I think I'm getting better at it I think it helps that I make money doing this streaming thing and I know they don't so like they're being paid nothing to be assholes Please.

7264
09:05:48,110 --> 09:05:49,090
Oh my god.

7265
09:05:51,930 --> 09:05:54,410
So it helps a lot knowing that, I guess.

7266
09:06:00,960 --> 09:06:02,080
And it does help a lot.

7267
09:06:07,390 --> 09:06:07,750
Okay.

7268
09:06:10,310 --> 09:06:13,090
So I think, I think that's character development.

7269
09:06:20,820 --> 09:06:21,000
I don't know.

7270
09:06:21,460 --> 09:06:23,100
Come on, come on.

7271
09:06:25,780 --> 09:06:26,900
Oh my god.

7272
09:06:26,920 --> 09:06:28,720
I don't even have somewhere else yet.

7273
09:06:28,980 --> 09:06:29,560
What the fuck?

7274
09:06:31,780 --> 09:06:32,940
Okay, we wrapped it.

7275
09:06:33,640 --> 09:06:34,780
Goodbye, everybody.

7276
09:06:35,540 --> 09:06:35,780
Goodbye.

7277
09:06:38,200 --> 09:06:39,160
That's unlucky.

7278
09:06:48,350 --> 09:06:49,550
I had...

7279
09:06:49,550 --> 09:06:49,730
Oh.

7280
09:06:50,910 --> 09:06:51,150
Oh.

7281
09:06:51,810 --> 09:06:52,270
What?

7282
09:06:52,890 --> 09:06:53,510
Oh, it's too late.

7283
09:06:53,650 --> 09:06:55,070
And that's a bit late.

7284
09:06:57,430 --> 09:06:58,030
Okay.

7285
09:06:58,570 --> 09:06:59,950
I had...

7286
09:06:59,950 --> 09:07:00,370
Why?

7287
09:07:00,690 --> 09:07:00,950
Why?

7288
09:07:03,470 --> 09:07:04,790
I'm sorry.

7289
09:07:05,090 --> 09:07:06,370
I had up.

7290
09:07:07,750 --> 09:07:09,970
I wasn't the one that's supposed to TP.

7291
09:07:10,770 --> 09:07:11,510
I had up.

7292
09:07:16,070 --> 09:07:17,310
Oh, they're dumb.

7293
09:07:17,650 --> 09:07:18,670
They're actually dumb.

7294
09:07:20,390 --> 09:07:20,610
Never mind.

7295
09:07:20,750 --> 09:07:22,410
I actually got my team killed.

7296
09:07:25,670 --> 09:07:27,310
Where are we supposed to go?

7297
09:07:27,390 --> 09:07:28,270
Like, down here?

7298
09:07:29,750 --> 09:07:30,810
Aw, no.

7299
09:07:32,190 --> 09:07:33,230
Oh

7300
09:07:38,290 --> 09:07:47,650
This sucks Like can we contest?

7301
09:07:48,970 --> 09:07:50,030
Why are we contesting?

7302
09:07:50,190 --> 09:07:51,170
I'm so confused

7303
09:07:55,370 --> 09:07:58,670
Oh my god, why did everyone leave me?

7304
09:08:00,490 --> 09:08:04,750
Everyone just left me I'm so confused.

7305
09:08:05,770 --> 09:08:06,970
Okay, I'm coming back now.

7306
09:08:09,030 --> 09:08:10,170
I was like, hey, guys.

7307
09:08:10,990 --> 09:08:11,910
Are we all fighting?

7308
09:08:21,070 --> 09:08:21,670
Okay.

7309
09:08:22,870 --> 09:08:25,470
I was like, where is everyone going?

7310
09:08:25,930 --> 09:08:28,870
Like, we let them push so much.

7311
09:08:29,310 --> 09:08:29,710
Why?

7312
09:08:30,990 --> 09:08:32,430
I was so confused.

7313
09:08:32,610 --> 09:08:35,150
Everyone, they were pushing so much for no reason.

7314
09:08:36,450 --> 09:08:39,930
Um, they're just gonna use the cops.

7315
09:08:39,950 --> 09:08:45,850
I'm boned now, which I am a little scared about.

7316
09:08:46,850 --> 09:08:47,450
Oh.

7317
09:08:48,330 --> 09:08:49,290
Oh, we're dead.

7318
09:08:49,610 --> 09:08:49,990
We're dead.

7319
09:08:50,390 --> 09:08:51,510
Oh, we're so...

7320
09:08:51,510 --> 09:08:52,550
We're so dead.

7321
09:08:53,270 --> 09:08:54,490
They use everything.

7322
09:08:56,790 --> 09:08:58,670
I don't know why we all got that.

7323
09:08:58,750 --> 09:08:59,070
It's fine.

7324
09:08:59,210 --> 09:08:59,730
We just reset.

7325
09:09:01,010 --> 09:09:02,270
We're so dead.

7326
09:09:08,730 --> 09:09:10,530
That's crazy that they use.

7327
09:09:14,200 --> 09:09:14,800
Okay, thanks.

7328
09:09:15,160 --> 09:09:15,920
Okay, thanks.

7329
09:09:17,800 --> 09:09:18,340
I'm touching.

7330
09:09:21,920 --> 09:09:22,520
Oh,

7331
09:09:25,620 --> 09:09:26,060
please!

7332
09:09:26,660 --> 09:09:27,660
I can't play Luna.

7333
09:09:27,680 --> 09:09:31,140
I'm playing Luna into this.

7334
09:09:33,220 --> 09:09:35,020
I just can't play Luna into this.

7335
09:09:35,580 --> 09:09:36,680
It's not worth it.

7336
09:09:37,360 --> 09:09:39,960
It's so hard to...

7337
09:09:39,960 --> 09:09:41,900
Like, nobody's peeling for me.

7338
09:09:42,140 --> 09:09:43,000
Swap a little bit of drift.

7339
09:09:44,540 --> 09:09:50,880
it's just too high I feel that I need

7340
09:10:05,030 --> 09:10:09,850
I'm not getting any peel

7341
09:10:14,550 --> 09:10:22,490
holy shit what is peeling um if If I'm getting doved by someone, I have no one to...

7342
09:10:22,490 --> 09:10:24,030
No one's covering me.

7343
09:10:25,390 --> 09:10:26,230
So that...

7344
09:10:26,230 --> 09:10:27,870
I literally have no...

7345
09:10:29,910 --> 09:10:30,990
I have no cover.

7346
09:10:31,250 --> 09:10:31,810
I have just the combo.

7347
09:10:34,850 --> 09:10:38,130
So like, I have 11 deaths because I literally...

7348
09:10:38,130 --> 09:10:40,170
Nobody is like covering me.

7349
09:10:44,190 --> 09:10:44,730
Like...

7350
09:10:45,890 --> 09:10:47,630
There's no reason for me to ult it.

7351
09:10:49,830 --> 09:10:51,590
We can just contest.

7352
09:10:52,190 --> 09:10:53,130
We can contest maybe.

7353
09:10:53,490 --> 09:10:54,910
Only two.

7354
09:10:55,110 --> 09:10:57,010
Yeah, I have ult though.

7355
09:10:58,890 --> 09:11:00,490
I can ult this year.

7356
09:11:00,890 --> 09:11:01,990
We're coming.

7357
09:11:03,270 --> 09:11:04,510
Oh, you're a bit sad.

7358
09:11:10,870 --> 09:11:13,390
I didn't go in, was it?

7359
09:11:17,550 --> 09:11:19,310
Alright, let's just grab this.

7360
09:11:21,510 --> 09:11:22,790
There we are.

7361
09:11:23,030 --> 09:11:26,670
Now we got that big up.

7362
09:11:30,700 --> 09:11:37,460
The only concern is that we got stacked for...

7363
09:11:37,460 --> 09:11:37,780
Please.

7364
09:11:39,680 --> 09:11:41,720
Okay, see, that's what I'm saying.

7365
09:11:44,130 --> 09:11:47,080
Oh my god, that's much better.

7366
09:11:48,080 --> 09:11:52,520
Holy shit, it's much better playing Invist than Luna against this.

7367
09:11:53,860 --> 09:11:55,240
That was Ashley's story.

7368
09:11:55,260 --> 09:11:59,300
hard for no fucking reason

7369
09:12:06,430 --> 09:12:24,110
oh man i couldn't it's fine i have a lot oh i have all here oh i'll die

7370
09:12:34,240 --> 09:12:35,620
I'll catch you up.

7371
09:12:35,880 --> 09:12:36,620
That's much better.

7372
09:12:42,680 --> 09:12:43,220
What?

7373
09:12:44,540 --> 09:12:45,980
Oh my god.

7374
09:12:47,100 --> 09:12:48,000
That's so unlucky.

7375
09:12:48,660 --> 09:12:50,100
That's so unlucky for me.

7376
09:12:50,240 --> 09:12:51,140
I'm so sad.

7377
09:12:52,000 --> 09:12:53,000
I'm so sad.

7378
09:12:54,680 --> 09:12:55,400
I'm so sad.

7379
09:12:55,580 --> 09:12:56,000
I threw that.

7380
09:12:56,280 --> 09:13:01,560
I actually, I didn't, I couldn't see the, I didn't see the, um, I actually threw that too.

7381
09:13:01,740 --> 09:13:02,620
That makes me so sad.

7382
09:13:05,400 --> 09:13:06,420
Oh my god.

7383
09:13:07,140 --> 09:13:31,360
that was my bad wait a day I didn't I didn't see the they got their root number combo time to switch things up including which side you're on I couldn't see the outline you'll need a top-notch team to win this one

7384
09:13:49,050 --> 09:13:59,490
okay That's unlucky.

7385
09:14:00,030 --> 09:14:01,170
Yeah, no, I...

7386
09:14:03,230 --> 09:14:05,750
I threw that last fight.

7387
09:14:06,450 --> 09:14:08,610
The last fight, I say I threw it.

7388
09:14:09,090 --> 09:14:10,090
Because, like, I didn't...

7389
09:14:10,090 --> 09:14:11,890
I couldn't see the whale outline.

7390
09:14:12,190 --> 09:14:13,710
Yeah, it's called Animal Crossing.

7391
09:14:15,530 --> 09:14:17,510
That's why I have 14 deaths there.

7392
09:14:18,130 --> 09:14:18,770
I literally...

7393
09:14:18,770 --> 09:14:22,570
I couldn't see the outline of the whale.

7394
09:14:23,230 --> 09:14:25,610
If I knew where the whale is, I wouldn't have done that.

7395
09:14:25,610 --> 09:14:26,250
But I didn't.

7396
09:14:30,750 --> 09:14:31,790
That sucks.

7397
09:14:32,630 --> 09:14:33,390
That was my bad.

7398
09:14:33,450 --> 09:14:35,510
I would admit that I fucked that up.

7399
09:14:36,390 --> 09:14:36,770
Is there a way?

7400
09:14:37,450 --> 09:14:38,110
It's because it's blue.

7401
09:14:38,710 --> 09:14:40,630
And the ending area is blue too.

7402
09:14:41,230 --> 09:14:43,670
Unless I played in like really fucking shitty graphics.

7403
09:14:44,390 --> 09:14:46,250
But like I don't like that.

7404
09:14:48,630 --> 09:14:49,150
Yeah.

7405
09:15:04,890 --> 09:15:05,410
Alright.

7406
09:15:05,770 --> 09:15:07,850
I don't think that's our tree by the way.

7407
09:15:13,130 --> 09:15:13,550
Alright.

7408
09:15:13,750 --> 09:15:13,790
Alright.

7409
09:15:15,430 --> 09:15:18,530
Don't worry everyone, I got my second win.

7410
09:15:19,390 --> 09:15:21,370
I can keep playing.

7411
09:15:28,000 --> 09:15:28,840
Okay.

7412
09:15:30,140 --> 09:15:30,180
Oh.

7413
09:15:38,390 --> 09:15:39,730
Oh no!

7414
09:15:41,230 --> 09:15:42,410
We just got...

7415
09:15:42,410 --> 09:15:45,250
Oh, we just got Ultron up too.

7416
09:15:45,930 --> 09:15:46,670
That's unlucky.

7417
09:15:49,230 --> 09:15:50,650
We're coming back.

7418
09:15:50,950 --> 09:15:52,350
Just live.

7419
09:15:58,510 --> 09:15:59,990
Just live.

7420
09:16:16,310 --> 09:16:16,930
I'm reload.

7421
09:16:22,890 --> 09:16:24,590
Please, please, please, please, please.

7422
09:16:25,110 --> 09:16:25,790
I got two.

7423
09:16:31,190 --> 09:16:31,790
I got three.

7424
09:16:32,570 --> 09:16:33,170
Oh, it's Jeff.

7425
09:16:33,470 --> 09:16:34,150
You're losing.

7426
09:16:34,610 --> 09:16:36,250
Oh my god.

7427
09:16:37,230 --> 09:16:39,470
I hate playing Luna.

7428
09:16:39,910 --> 09:16:40,590
This is Luna.

7429
09:16:47,200 --> 09:16:48,250
It's not fun.

7430
09:16:50,060 --> 09:16:51,980
It's not fun anymore.

7431
09:16:52,000 --> 09:17:01,620
more it's not fun it makes me so sad

7432
09:17:15,710 --> 09:17:52,170
played right side of countries okay right side skylock on the left watch out i don't have to be center stage oh my god i think I think this is where oh my god I'm lag I'm like fucking teleporting everywhere I'm actually just teleporting I I hate playing her she's just miserable she's split up but Don't Lexi 9.

7433
09:17:52,310 --> 09:17:54,490
They're so, it's so miserable.

7434
09:18:13,450 --> 09:18:14,570
I'm sorry.

7435
09:18:16,550 --> 09:18:17,230
I'm sorry.

7436
09:18:17,750 --> 09:18:19,530
I didn't want to die.

7437
09:18:28,850 --> 09:18:29,970
I'm sorry.

7438
09:18:31,430 --> 09:18:33,770
I knew I would die if I went there.

7439
09:18:34,630 --> 09:18:37,450
No, I gotta go for the rush.

7440
09:18:37,870 --> 09:18:39,630
Jeff, you could have...

7441
09:18:39,630 --> 09:18:40,530
You would have made it.

7442
09:18:42,750 --> 09:19:00,930
maybe yeah no not maybe i tp'd after you walked past one and i still made it but with no one to touch if you had tp the son of me you would have made it and someone could have touched like me yeah like i made the split decision to try to use my heart because maybe she should have already stayed light but she should have gone down and then i should have just taken the gun for car i made a mistake it's okay

7443
09:19:04,880 --> 09:19:08,920
oh my god do you want to go no more side and i'll go ultron here

7444
09:19:14,640 --> 09:20:14,380
winnable but you want me on them all I don't know if I'm better than you in them all this is it's like it's just I it's just like Luna right now relies on the team to make sure she doesn't die so like if my other support and my team doesn't appeal for me or like you know make sure i'm alive then i'm i'm like the most easily killed person in this entire team uh because of the fact that they can just walk up to me and my only defense is my freeze and so it's it's hell it's like i get dove non-stop but like i also have to win every 1v1 if i do have a 1v1 i need to win every 1v1 if i'm And like,

7445
09:20:14,520 --> 09:20:19,260
that is impossible for me, especially because I'm playing EU Pings right now.

7446
09:20:31,210 --> 09:20:37,170
So it's even scarier just because of the fact...

7447
09:20:42,070 --> 09:20:44,570
Oh my god, like right now.

7448
09:20:54,440 --> 09:21:07,180
Oh my god, this is so hard Because they want Because we're doing triple support With Ultra So I have to play Luna

7449
09:21:10,730 --> 09:21:11,990
Are you serious?

7450
09:21:24,010 --> 09:21:32,850
Oh, they used it, they used it, nice Wait, oh we used it I can't build up Wait, why did we use up?

7451
09:21:35,230 --> 09:22:05,550
I have 19 that's how fucking like I want to die playing this character I in this current meta like I'm technically I am I am I am dying oh my god why are we up

7452
09:22:11,580 --> 09:22:17,620
last pick oh my god look get me up get me up pocket man

7453
09:22:25,070 --> 09:23:09,330
oh my god i hate i hate playing luna i and the thing is they're making it even worse to play luna season because in I playing Luna playing Luna against that cop actually made me want to uninstall life in game in game holy death in game in game

7454
09:23:16,510 --> 09:23:50,390
so the thing is it's gonna be even more miserable to play Luna next season because they're buffing uh they're buffing um venom and they're making a daredevil comes into play and apparently daredevil is a stronger iron fist so it's like oh do you want it you don't live You don't fucking live until you're tired unless your entire team is actually babysitting you and you know in the rank environment That is impossible.

7455
09:23:50,810 --> 09:23:53,570
That's why I fucking hate playing Luna

7456
09:23:58,290 --> 09:24:00,130
Okay, thank you for the hundred biddies.

7457
09:24:00,350 --> 09:24:00,510
Thank you.

7458
09:24:00,870 --> 09:24:01,190
Thank you

7459
09:24:05,510 --> 09:24:06,490
What's the win?

7460
09:24:06,630 --> 09:24:14,090
We're actually up 60 points I don't know which is that was a plus 16 game to Jesus Christ.

7461
09:24:15,270 --> 09:24:16,730
I felt Jesus.

7462
09:24:19,470 --> 09:24:22,110
That was a plus 16 points game.

7463
09:24:22,690 --> 09:24:23,790
That's crazy.

7464
09:24:28,520 --> 09:24:32,100
Parappa, thank you for gifting a tier 1 sub to Aurora.

7465
09:24:32,760 --> 09:24:34,860
Yeah, because it was a GM game.

7466
09:24:39,380 --> 09:24:42,200
The thing is, Luna is already very fucking strong.

7467
09:24:42,340 --> 09:24:42,980
That's the thing.

7468
09:24:43,100 --> 09:24:44,620
She is very strong.

7469
09:24:47,040 --> 09:25:19,920
um so like you can't really buff her because like she already has so much you know she already has like a lot of util but it's just she's miserable to play against that she is just so fucking miserable i don't understand why people can't i i in my i not my i i um what's I'm like very

7470
09:25:26,370 --> 09:26:19,790
I don't know what's the word Like pros who can play support and deal with that In a pro environment Because it must not be fun If you're a support You know a pro support player Dealing with that in an actual Like team environment Yeah I respect yeah I respect the pro support players that could do this every day by the way every day i this is why i'm a variety streamer i i don't understand how how they can do that oh yeah and another thing where i'm like pro players have the weakest mental like you know like when when they lose they would like post this tweet and be like i'm sorry i failed you um like i want to quit i'm i'm going to quit now and then it's like one loss so So I understand.

7471
09:26:20,030 --> 09:26:31,970
I understand because it like hurts, you know, you're like you made your fans Disappointed, you know, like I understand that, but it's like They like go like the most emo shit ever like on Twitter too.

7472
09:26:32,170 --> 09:26:43,950
It's like so fucking emo Please don't no, please I I don't want to I don't want to really

7473
09:26:56,430 --> 09:27:23,430
like when when they when when the people go extra emo they like change their profile they change their profile picture to like a black image and then like put like a quote or something as the twitter header or like the twitter description i've seen a pro player that did that like i don't remember which game it was but they lost a they they lost like a like like um a tournament and And then one of the players changed it to that.

7474
09:27:25,450 --> 09:27:27,230
I don't remember which esport it was.

7475
09:27:27,390 --> 09:27:30,690
I just was like, bro, you have so many more turns.

7476
09:27:31,170 --> 09:27:31,430
Bro.

7477
09:27:32,210 --> 09:27:33,810
What do you want to play, Ash?

7478
09:27:34,410 --> 09:27:36,710
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

7479
09:27:39,190 --> 09:27:40,330
Can I ammo a new mag?

7480
09:27:42,950 --> 09:27:44,330
Uh, yeah, you can ammo.

7481
09:27:49,630 --> 09:27:50,710
Why do we have bad venom though?

7482
09:27:50,870 --> 09:27:51,110
Fuck.

7483
09:27:53,510 --> 09:27:54,910
Who banned Venom?

7484
09:27:55,510 --> 09:27:56,290
Who was it?

7485
09:28:05,440 --> 09:28:05,600
Aww.

7486
09:28:06,480 --> 09:28:08,840
I don't...

7487
09:28:08,840 --> 09:28:12,160
I was so ready to play in this.

7488
09:28:12,600 --> 09:28:14,560
I was so fucking ready.

7489
09:28:16,620 --> 09:28:17,680
Yeah, strong together.

7490
09:28:18,840 --> 09:28:19,020
It's

7491
09:28:22,890 --> 09:28:25,290
just been thrust into darkness and overrun.

7492
09:28:35,580 --> 09:28:36,760
Alright, here we go.

7493
09:28:37,100 --> 09:28:42,680
Battle starts in 5, 4, 3, 2, Can you break bridge, Mag?

7494
09:28:43,320 --> 09:28:45,500
You have to stop them from securing the mission area.

7495
09:28:45,680 --> 09:28:46,200
Mag, can you break bridge?

7496
09:28:48,180 --> 09:28:49,520
I don't think Mag...

7497
09:28:50,360 --> 09:28:53,400
Guys, I don't think Mag is breaking the bridge, guys.

7498
09:28:53,960 --> 09:28:56,160
I don't think he's doing it.

7499
09:28:56,760 --> 09:28:58,380
I don't know why.

7500
09:28:59,180 --> 09:29:01,640
Oh, let's hope I hear a Angela!

7501
09:29:03,480 --> 09:29:05,780
Oh, is that an Angela?

7502
09:29:06,100 --> 09:29:07,780
What the fuck?

7503
09:29:08,800 --> 09:29:09,700
Did he...

7504
09:29:10,000 --> 09:29:10,980
Oh, shit.

7505
09:29:11,440 --> 09:29:12,740
Okay

7506
09:29:17,120 --> 09:29:26,340
He didn't she didn't push him in time Oh Oh

7507
09:29:32,040 --> 09:29:41,020
We all Someone needs a snowball in the face A shortcut for space Thomas have been this.

7508
09:29:43,740 --> 09:29:46,760
I'll let him build it.

7509
09:29:46,860 --> 09:29:48,820
Alright, here ya.

7510
09:29:51,340 --> 09:29:54,440
Three, two, one, my old is over.

7511
09:29:57,440 --> 09:29:58,700
Oh, this is bad.

7512
09:29:59,620 --> 09:30:01,020
This is so bad for me.

7513
09:30:01,160 --> 09:30:03,180
This is so bad for me.

7514
09:30:05,900 --> 09:30:06,520
Alright.

7515
09:30:09,180 --> 09:30:12,420
I was not able to build all at all.

7516
09:30:15,300 --> 09:30:16,440
That's unlucky.

7517
09:30:19,400 --> 09:30:19,400
Thing.

7518
09:30:20,180 --> 09:30:20,180
Okay.

7519
09:30:23,780 --> 09:30:25,300
Alright, at least I have ult now.

7520
09:30:26,920 --> 09:30:30,200
Yeah, that Phoenix built ult charge off of us so fast.

7521
09:30:30,300 --> 09:30:30,780
It's crazy.

7522
09:30:33,020 --> 09:30:34,020
Oh, nice.

7523
09:30:38,770 --> 09:30:41,130
Oh, maybe she'll build another.

7524
09:30:41,150 --> 09:31:58,070
one let's find out it's time to fight okay i vote now i know it's this emma as well so i'm just gonna make sure i don't peek here i have that issue in uh during like east coast lobbies jesus christ thank god during east coast lobbies where like i would have this is i hate it made me so mad it was during like uh it was like uh during my rank grind i'm playing invis or like luna and i would have like 60 to 80 ping i have 60 and 80 ping in east coast and it would play the animation will play but it didn't but then like it cancels because like the stuff and then so okay nice so like i wouldn't it wouldn't go off but i had the animation playing that was the worst part i had the animation playing but it didn't go off because of ping which pisses me off because we lost the game because of it because it was like final fight and everything

7525
09:32:02,210 --> 09:32:04,930
Please, please, please, please, please, oh my god.

7526
09:32:05,730 --> 09:32:07,150
I needed heals here.

7527
09:32:08,950 --> 09:32:09,570
Oh, I'm looking.

7528
09:32:12,050 --> 09:32:13,330
Oh my god.

7529
09:32:13,430 --> 09:32:14,130
There was nothing I could do.

7530
09:32:14,250 --> 09:32:14,850
I didn't have clap.

7531
09:32:18,650 --> 09:32:19,870
I'm just not...

7532
09:32:19,870 --> 09:32:21,590
My Invis is sucking up all the heals.

7533
09:32:22,290 --> 09:32:23,970
So I can't build it.

7534
09:32:24,850 --> 09:32:26,210
She's sucking it all up.

7535
09:32:26,410 --> 09:32:27,790
I don't know what else to do.

7536
09:32:34,490 --> 09:32:35,010
Please.

7537
09:32:36,570 --> 09:32:38,370
I am ready to put on a show.

7538
09:32:39,630 --> 09:32:40,250
Oh my god.

7539
09:32:42,990 --> 09:32:43,310
Okay.

7540
09:32:44,250 --> 09:32:45,170
Invis, invis.

7541
09:32:52,630 --> 09:32:53,150
Okay.

7542
09:32:53,930 --> 09:32:54,190
Oh!

7543
09:32:56,510 --> 09:32:56,850
Oh!

7544
09:32:56,850 --> 09:32:59,510
It's just, I'm just gonna give, I'm gonna give Invis the heals.

7545
09:33:00,670 --> 09:33:03,490
It's just unlucky because...

7546
09:33:03,490 --> 09:34:07,960
Because she's sucking up all the heals, I can't build my ult fast enough so it's actually really detrimental for me don't worry I'm coming back everyone like like right now she's taking all the heals but she has all and I need the heal ult charge that's something like I'd hire you though people more conscious of like other support players are more conscious about when they're like oh oh i have alt now i should heal less so my other support can get her alt charge too but they did not do that and i'm like i guess i got like i'm at 57 let oh that's unlucky yeah

7547
09:34:12,020 --> 09:34:18,680
only 60 seconds it should also be like a conscious thing like i wouldn't have to comment if like

7548
09:34:22,440 --> 09:34:33,070
it shouldn't oh that's unlucky that's unlucky what the fuck oh my god this sucks

7549
09:34:36,920 --> 09:34:46,960
like the thing is i shouldn't have to comment when she should be aware of it especially in this Because this is like,

7550
09:35:00,910 --> 09:35:02,330
uh...

7551
09:35:02,330 --> 09:35:03,450
Jesus Christ.

7552
09:35:04,210 --> 09:35:06,570
I'll be using more as a...

7553
09:35:07,050 --> 09:35:07,390
Wait.

7554
09:35:20,670 --> 09:35:21,810
Oh my god.

7555
09:35:22,090 --> 09:35:24,230
Oh my, it's not fine.

7556
09:35:24,430 --> 09:35:25,170
It was...

7557
09:35:25,170 --> 09:35:27,030
It was not fine in the end.

7558
09:35:28,450 --> 09:35:30,350
It was not fine.

7559
09:35:31,610 --> 09:36:49,530
I think we need triple support at this point I have to go raccoon so we can get the res off oh we could like I don't think one angle is worth your playing thing always bad good there I mean so you can press your fucking button on top of the star level no okay I guess and just keep any white feather holes then that's also pretty fun oh my god why are they fighting you can also just play around this i don't i don't understand who he's yelling at i why did i not avoid prisms after next to his in bar what is he at oh rush is man don't worry i don't be the single tier list of this guy oh no rush apparently does this when he's mad he throws when he's mad and he thinks the game is not winnable i was told about this he would go squirrel girl i mean why is he playing eu cues too to be fair why is he here

7560
09:37:01,600 --> 09:37:05,960
that's what i'm saying weak ass mental

7561
09:37:09,700 --> 09:37:19,560
actually weak ass mental the battle starts in five fucking your entire ego is like, whether a win or a loss in a game.

7562
09:37:19,740 --> 09:37:20,700
Which is true, me too.

7563
09:37:20,900 --> 09:37:24,140
But, like, I just cry.

7564
09:37:31,260 --> 09:37:32,820
I'm really happy.

7565
09:37:40,640 --> 09:37:42,240
Squirrel Girl was never a meta.

7566
09:37:42,300 --> 09:37:44,240
What the fuck are you guys on about?

7567
09:37:44,300 --> 09:37:46,560
I don't remember Squirrel Girl being meta.

7568
09:37:57,250 --> 09:37:58,210
Jesus Christ.

7569
09:37:59,350 --> 09:38:00,770
Okay, we can walk forward to a team.

7570
09:38:00,890 --> 09:38:01,670
We have a pick.

7571
09:38:01,770 --> 09:38:02,590
I don't understand why.

7572
09:38:02,950 --> 09:38:03,590
What the?

7573
09:38:03,710 --> 09:38:04,470
Where am I?

7574
09:38:05,390 --> 09:38:05,930
Oh my god.

7575
09:38:06,570 --> 09:38:06,990
All time.

7576
09:38:07,170 --> 09:38:07,890
What do you want me to do?

7577
09:38:08,390 --> 09:38:08,850
I mean, you're not.

7578
09:38:08,930 --> 09:38:10,370
I'm literally watching both mine and my back.

7579
09:38:10,490 --> 09:38:11,650
These people are like not moving.

7580
09:38:12,250 --> 09:38:14,390
It's also like evident by your, your old guard.

7581
09:38:16,570 --> 09:38:17,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7582
09:38:17,430 --> 09:38:18,210
It's not like you should do.

7583
09:38:18,310 --> 09:38:18,750
You're harmless.

7584
09:38:19,630 --> 09:38:19,950
It's whatever.

7585
09:38:21,790 --> 09:38:22,830
You don't have to hostage.

7586
09:38:22,990 --> 09:38:24,150
It's just because you're, just because your hand is.

7587
09:38:24,650 --> 09:38:25,910
Oh my god.

7588
09:38:26,230 --> 09:38:26,490

7589
09:38:26,810 --> 09:38:28,210

7593
09:39:03,910 --> 09:39:03,990
Yes!

7594
09:39:06,690 --> 09:39:07,250
Offstream?

7595
09:39:08,990 --> 09:39:09,510
Offstream?

7596
09:39:09,770 --> 09:39:13,010
I've never had so many people yelling at each other.

7597
09:39:14,530 --> 09:39:15,090
Like...

7598
09:39:15,090 --> 09:39:18,230
This stream alone has had the most...

7599
09:39:19,350 --> 09:39:19,910
Arguments.

7600
09:39:22,470 --> 09:39:24,010
I'm here for you.

7601
09:39:33,350 --> 09:39:34,190
Okay.

7602
09:39:40,060 --> 09:39:40,900
Okay.

7603
09:39:47,040 --> 09:39:50,020
I swear, this is the most...

7604
09:39:50,560 --> 09:39:50,980
I've...

7605
09:39:50,980 --> 09:39:57,500
Offstream, when I was doing the grind, offstream, I haven't had these arguments at all.

7606
09:39:59,080 --> 09:40:00,240
It's crazy.

7607
09:40:01,140 --> 09:40:01,940
Is that...

7608
09:40:02,020 --> 09:40:04,180
It's actually wild.

7609
09:40:05,280 --> 09:40:07,620
These people are so angry.

7610
09:40:08,260 --> 09:40:10,900
They really want to secure your top 500.

7611
09:40:11,300 --> 09:40:13,120
They're so angry.

7612
09:40:15,000 --> 09:40:16,560
They're so mad.

7613
09:40:17,720 --> 09:40:19,160
Oh my god.

7614
09:40:20,580 --> 09:40:22,460
Why are you so mad?

7615
09:40:22,780 --> 09:40:24,080
I don't understand.

7616
09:40:25,460 --> 09:40:27,800
Does your mommy not hug you?

7617
09:40:28,420 --> 09:40:29,020
I'm sorry.

7618
09:40:29,160 --> 09:40:30,200
Oh, maybe you're...

7619
09:40:30,780 --> 09:40:32,000
I'm sorry.

7620
09:40:32,020 --> 09:40:33,340
Sorry, bro.

7621
09:40:36,760 --> 09:40:38,940
Hello, I hide now.

7622
09:40:40,920 --> 09:40:42,080
I'm sorry, bro.

7623
09:40:42,500 --> 09:40:43,900
Do you not have a mama?

7624
09:40:47,180 --> 09:40:56,000
Like, I know mommy issues are also very common too in like, pro play, but like, bro, it's okay.

7625
09:40:58,680 --> 09:41:01,480
You'll find your kitten soon.

7626
09:41:04,980 --> 09:41:12,140
No, it is apparently, yes, it's, oh my, it is very common.

7627
09:41:20,020 --> 09:41:22,120
I'm just dead, I don't know.

7628
09:41:25,680 --> 09:41:28,060
I should have let these down more this game.

7629
09:41:31,160 --> 09:41:32,840
It's just unfortunate.

7630
09:41:34,260 --> 09:41:35,460
Don't worry, we don't find their...

7631
09:41:35,500 --> 09:41:39,180
kid in one day i believe i'm not beating

7632
09:41:48,830 --> 09:41:52,150
avoiding human argument on

7633
09:41:58,060 --> 09:42:01,300
i'm going to look at your profile okay

7634
09:42:04,520 --> 09:42:38,520
please don't break you why are you asking permission like a dog if you're a private profile never queue up again because you can't even argue because you have no idea why would I listen to a man what you're talking about like you're so third world that this is the way you speak holy shit

7635
09:42:44,020 --> 09:42:55,600
It's quite embarrassing Like you have to be flustered Opening your mouth And being this sophisticated You and four Just speak the exact same way

7636
09:42:59,600 --> 09:43:14,060
Oh my god Wait You need some Because it feels like your man Is not making your life Better Oh, you guys try to say he's gay, too?

7637
09:43:14,680 --> 09:43:16,100
He's like, he needs to get dick?

7638
09:43:16,280 --> 09:43:17,740
Oh, my God, he needs dick.

7639
09:43:18,220 --> 09:43:20,040
That's what he's trying to say.

7640
09:43:20,480 --> 09:43:25,280
He needs to get laid and get some dick of his ass, I guess.

7641
09:43:26,060 --> 09:43:28,040
You love men, too.

7642
09:43:28,520 --> 09:43:31,760
Why are you projecting love men?

7643
09:43:32,840 --> 09:43:38,600
This makes sense since you're incapable of thinking for yourself with your attitude.

7644
09:43:38,840 --> 09:43:41,900
You can't be a straight bed.

7645
09:43:42,800 --> 09:43:45,960
Like, we're gonna stay single.

7646
09:43:46,640 --> 09:43:48,240
Pathetic that you act like that.

7647
09:43:48,560 --> 09:43:50,220
Or leave the closet.

7648
09:43:50,800 --> 09:43:52,260
I don't know.

7649
09:43:55,800 --> 09:44:00,440
Both are bed maybe they should just kiss each other.

7650
09:44:00,960 --> 09:44:02,060
Bro, is this flirting?

7651
09:44:02,660 --> 09:44:06,240
Am I actually, is this yaoi?

7652
09:44:11,440 --> 09:44:13,840
Oh my god.

7653
09:44:14,060 --> 09:44:15,920
Enemies to lovers.

7654
09:44:17,220 --> 09:44:20,200
Oh my god.

7655
09:44:20,660 --> 09:44:23,660
I think my favorite one.

7656
09:44:24,060 --> 09:44:27,180
Why would I listen to a man?

7657
09:44:29,980 --> 09:44:31,680
That's crazy.

7658
09:44:32,200 --> 09:44:33,400
That's actually crazy.

7659
09:44:33,640 --> 09:44:35,980
I used to find you a Pia for that.

7660
09:44:36,500 --> 09:44:37,300

7661
09:45:42,110 --> 09:45:56,350

7663
09:46:12,890 --> 09:46:13,930
Holy shit.

7664
09:46:15,670 --> 09:46:16,710
Actually insane.

7665
09:46:20,780 --> 09:46:23,120
Like, they should just like, they should just hook up.

7666
09:46:23,300 --> 09:46:26,340
This is like, I can feel the sexual tension from these two.

7667
09:46:26,840 --> 09:46:29,880
Like, you love men too.

7668
09:46:30,020 --> 09:46:32,640
Why are you projecting love ma-

7669
09:46:39,820 --> 09:46:41,780
They were so strong.

7670
09:46:44,830 --> 09:46:46,850
I was not...

7671
09:46:46,850 --> 09:46:48,190
I was not...

7672
09:46:48,190 --> 09:46:49,090
Oh, and you get water.

7673
09:46:49,450 --> 09:46:50,390
I finished my water.

7674
09:46:50,610 --> 09:46:51,190
Give me a sec.

7675
09:46:51,870 --> 09:46:53,070
I'll finish my water.

7676
09:47:04,930 --> 09:47:06,730
Bro, I'm getting this for free too.

7677
09:47:06,770 --> 09:47:07,710
I'm getting paid.

7678
09:47:10,110 --> 09:47:11,070
With my...

7679
09:47:11,070 --> 09:47:14,370
I'm getting paid to get this content for free?

7680
09:47:15,190 --> 09:47:16,090
Oh, wait, no, not free.

7681
09:47:16,410 --> 09:47:18,630
But they're paying me to get this content.

7682
09:47:22,710 --> 09:47:25,470
I've never seen two people more perfect for each other.

7683
09:47:25,670 --> 09:47:27,010
I get paid a Doomcute?

7684
09:47:27,230 --> 09:47:27,530
No.

7685
09:47:28,290 --> 09:47:29,890
That's just...

7686
09:47:29,890 --> 09:47:30,950
Oh, what lifestyle?

7687
09:47:34,250 --> 09:47:37,990
It's just, unfortunately, a lifestyle at this point.

7688
09:47:40,370 --> 09:47:41,090
Like...

7689
09:47:41,090 --> 09:47:44,710
You're paying my mental for the entertainment.

7690
09:47:44,870 --> 09:47:45,750
That's so true.

7691
09:47:46,010 --> 09:47:46,870
That's so true.

7692
09:47:51,910 --> 09:47:52,690

I love my daily soap.

09:49:12,290 --> 09:49:16,930
No, look, look, wait, I was joking.

7700

Like, like, look at all these skits.

7705
09:50:05,700 --> 09:50:06,580
Like, look at this.

7706
09:50:07,240 --> 09:50:08,200
Look at...

7707
09:50:13,540 --> 09:50:15,480
Oh, that's sad.

7708
09:50:19,680 --> 09:50:20,920
Yeah, after...

7709
09:50:24,850 --> 09:50:25,470
25.

7710
09:50:26,290 --> 09:50:27,310
I didn't like you.

7711
09:50:28,010 --> 09:50:33,550
But, like, after that fucking last game, oh my god, all my energy was gone.

7712
09:50:33,670 --> 09:50:34,810
All that adrenaline I got.

7713
09:50:34,830 --> 09:50:44,730
from the loser disappeared because I had a good time when, like, we lost, but like their EU is so wild.

7714
09:50:45,270 --> 09:50:46,090
EU really is.

7715
09:50:46,190 --> 09:50:48,130
Maybe like end of season is wild.

7716
09:50:48,290 --> 09:50:49,170
I swear to God.

7717
09:50:49,550 --> 09:51:01,950
I swear to God, like when I was off stream, when I was playing like for like four to five hours off stream, nobody was fighting each other.

7718
09:51:02,330 --> 09:51:03,850
Like, it was like kumbaya.

7719
09:51:03,850 --> 09:51:16,410
but it was like four to five hours before i streamed it was like kumbaya like i didn't know what he talked or like everyone was just chill like that

7720
09:51:20,660 --> 09:51:35,300
and then i started stream and i swear i've been getting arguments like every other game every every other game it's been a wild argument

7721
09:51:39,570 --> 09:51:41,890
banish from this match

7722
09:51:45,080 --> 09:51:58,660
no not just eu but i've been having these it was been happening in na as well like i've been having some weird ass fucking conversations in na the

7724
09:52:17,540 --> 09:52:19,300
That's all I wanted to do.

7725
09:52:22,960 --> 09:52:24,460
That's not that toxic.

7726
09:52:33,840 --> 09:52:36,680
I'm gonna try my best to stay up the rest of the day.

7727
09:52:36,960 --> 09:52:37,100
Ah.

7728
09:52:38,340 --> 09:52:40,820
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

7729
09:52:41,940 --> 09:52:42,940
At least I don't have to play Luna.

7730
09:52:43,360 --> 09:52:44,700
I really don't want to play Luna.

7731
09:52:52,230 --> 09:52:53,330
Alright, I'm ready.

7732
09:52:55,970 --> 09:52:58,750
Ba-da-da-ba-ba-da.

7733
09:53:12,400 --> 09:53:14,240
All right, last game.

7734
09:53:14,900 --> 09:53:15,720
Okay, I should say that.

7735
09:53:16,260 --> 09:53:18,520
This is LG for me.

7736
09:53:21,060 --> 09:53:31,080
And then maybe, like, tonight, I can drag down the other pro player we befri- Well, I don't know if I can say befriended.

7737
09:53:31,460 --> 09:53:33,600
Maybe I can drag down the other pro-player.

7738
09:53:34,520 --> 09:53:36,560
Maybe I will stream arrivals.

7739
09:53:38,960 --> 09:53:40,580
Because I didn't want to stream.

7740
09:53:40,600 --> 09:54:00,180

7742
09:54:17,970 --> 09:54:19,330
Oh my god.

7743
09:54:19,490 --> 09:54:19,770
I don't know.

7744
09:54:20,470 --> 09:54:26,110
I want to say that it might not be winnable long term.

7745
09:54:31,410 --> 09:54:32,050
Okay.

7746
09:54:33,470 --> 09:54:35,090
Because they have.

7747
09:54:35,750 --> 09:54:36,610
Like, yeah, we are.

7748
09:54:36,710 --> 09:54:37,850
Okay, I won't.

7749
09:54:37,930 --> 09:54:38,630
I'm not dooming.

7750
09:54:38,790 --> 09:54:39,390
I won't doom.

7751
09:54:39,570 --> 09:54:40,190
I won't doom.

7752
09:54:40,430 --> 09:54:42,310
I won't doom, guys.

7753
09:54:42,910 --> 09:54:44,150
I won't doom.

7754
09:54:44,170 --> 09:54:44,370
Boom.

7755
09:54:46,050 --> 09:54:46,990
It could be winnable.

7756
09:54:48,070 --> 09:54:49,290
It's just when I see it.

7757
09:54:51,710 --> 09:54:55,630
When I see triple support, it makes me so sad.

7758
09:55:03,610 --> 09:55:05,530
Where is it?

7759
09:55:11,080 --> 09:55:13,400
What the fuck?

7760
09:55:14,220 --> 09:55:15,460
I think she'll be fine.

7761
09:55:15,460 --> 09:55:16,380
It's just Emma.

7762
09:55:17,340 --> 09:55:18,160
Bum bum bum.

7763
09:55:21,240 --> 09:55:28,240
I just get scared when I play against, when I play against triple support.

7764
09:55:29,000 --> 09:55:32,620
Because long term wise, triple support is scary long term.

7765
09:55:35,580 --> 09:55:45,020
Oh yeah, do you guys know that they're never gonna make villains into, they're never gonna put villains in, um, even though I'm like, because like I would say it, hella and Loki.

7766
09:55:45,460 --> 09:55:51,800
I thought Loki are villains, but they said they're never going to put Doom in Marvel Rivals because they think like...

7767
09:55:55,440 --> 09:55:56,000
Um...

7768
09:55:59,060 --> 09:56:01,460
Okay, this is bad because...

7769
09:56:04,300 --> 09:56:07,260
Okay, I don't know if you saw that pull I did.

7770
09:56:07,800 --> 09:56:08,660
That pull?

7771
09:56:09,040 --> 09:56:12,300
Oh my god, that was insane.

7772
09:56:12,620 --> 09:56:13,440
That pull?

7773
09:56:14,220 --> 09:56:16,660
Because they see Ultron as like an anti-hero.

7774
09:56:18,240 --> 09:56:22,920
That pull, they were going to use it to block the Strange Owl.

7775
09:56:23,040 --> 09:56:24,360
And I pulled him away from it.

7776
09:56:28,080 --> 09:56:28,660
What the?

7777
09:56:29,960 --> 09:56:32,420
This is bad because I used a pull and they have all...

7778
09:56:33,400 --> 09:56:36,560
That's why it's bad.

7779
09:56:38,580 --> 09:56:39,440
I'm Didge.

7780
09:56:40,740 --> 09:56:41,100
It's fine.

7781
09:56:41,180 --> 09:56:42,640
My Luna has Alt soon.

7782
09:56:43,440 --> 09:56:45,280
And she's not going to get ulted.

7783
09:56:46,020 --> 09:56:47,400
She got ulted.

7784
09:56:47,660 --> 09:56:50,700
I'll fight for my family until the end.

7785
09:56:51,020 --> 09:56:52,760
She got ulted, guys.

7786
09:56:59,280 --> 09:57:03,860
I remember reading that they're not planning on ever making Doom like an actual playable character.

7787
09:57:10,180 --> 09:57:13,020
Maybe they'll change that later.

7788
09:57:13,320 --> 09:57:15,020
I definitely remember reading about it.

7789
09:57:17,910 --> 09:57:20,770
Okay, but Loki...

7790
09:57:20,770 --> 09:57:20,790
Okay.

7791
09:57:20,810 --> 09:57:43,070
he's hot he has pretty privilege and you know it yeah that's interesting yeah I was gonna I got yeah

7792
09:57:46,650 --> 09:57:56,850
see this is what I mean long-term wise the moment they stabilize and alt rotate like it's different Jesse

7793
09:58:00,210 --> 09:58:09,170
And all it takes is just alt rotations You can just I need to save my ult for either Strain

7794
09:58:12,550 --> 09:58:16,330
Okay Alright

7795
09:58:20,150 --> 09:58:28,850
Oh that sucks We got kicked out There's a shark behind me There you are Oh

7796
09:58:32,950 --> 09:58:36,530
That sucks literally all we need is triple support

7797
09:58:44,750 --> 09:59:30,650
Yeah, he's just trolling he's just joking Is what I mean the moment the moment um We get stuck in a certain area is literally just alt rotations And it's so tilty That's why triple support will always be like better Because like yeah yeah we were like fucking we were fucking on that first fight but they stabilized now oh luck everybody what what what okay i don't like that yeah yeah they're running for it

7798
09:59:36,870 --> 09:59:38,970
Oh, what happened?

7799
09:59:43,010 --> 09:59:47,090
I have it now.

7800
09:59:51,150 --> 09:59:52,470
Okay, I got it just in time.

7801
09:59:54,950 --> 09:59:55,630
Thank God.

7802
10:00:04,510 --> 10:00:05,810
Okay, that's fine.

7803
10:00:06,630 --> 10:00:07,010
That's fine.

7804
10:00:07,110 --> 10:00:07,670
I got the Luna.

7805
10:00:09,690 --> 10:00:10,250
Alright.

7806
10:00:12,170 --> 10:00:12,870
It's okay.

7807
10:00:12,950 --> 10:00:13,530
I got the Luna.

7808
10:00:13,690 --> 10:00:14,550
I gotta think now.

7809
10:00:19,830 --> 10:00:20,890
I don't know.

7810
10:00:21,410 --> 10:00:26,990
The Luna ult was a little, like, scary, but everything is okay now.

7811
10:00:27,410 --> 10:00:28,650
I'll let the Luna build her ult.

7812
10:00:29,690 --> 10:00:30,030
Oh!

7813
10:00:31,670 --> 10:00:33,910
I have to, like, focus up there.

7814
10:00:34,490 --> 10:00:36,670
This is why I hate triple support, man.

7815
10:00:38,250 --> 10:00:39,070
Oh, my God.

7816
10:00:39,210 --> 10:00:41,190
I fucking hate triple support so much.

7817
10:00:41,590 --> 10:00:41,650
Oh!

7818
10:00:42,950 --> 10:00:43,990
It's just...

7819
10:00:44,010 --> 10:00:46,510
Not fun!

7820
10:00:50,220 --> 10:00:51,220
There we go.

7821
10:00:51,560 --> 10:00:51,560
See?

7822
10:00:51,860 --> 10:00:52,620
See, look at that.

7823
10:00:52,960 --> 10:00:53,360
Oh, goodbye.

7824
10:00:53,940 --> 10:00:54,700
Also, goodbye.

7825
10:00:55,420 --> 10:00:56,680
Oh, he's gonna do that.

7826
10:00:57,920 --> 10:00:58,540
Fucking...

7827
10:00:58,540 --> 10:00:59,460
God damn it.

7828
10:00:59,520 --> 10:01:00,280
Goodbye, everyone.

7829
10:01:01,480 --> 10:01:02,500
Goodbye, everybody.

7830
10:01:09,770 --> 10:01:10,710
I can die, maybe.

7831
10:01:21,840 --> 10:01:23,320
We win that.

7832
10:01:23,820 --> 10:01:24,540
Me and...

7833
10:01:24,540 --> 10:01:25,620

7837
10:01:33,980 --> 10:01:35,620

7838
10:01:35,760 --> 10:01:36,500
What the fuck?

7839
10:01:37,020 --> 10:01:38,540

10:01:53,410 --> 10:01:54,170
There we go.

7844
10:01:56,350 --> 10:01:57,590

Sometimes I just don't notice it.

7855
10:04:10,120 --> 10:04:10,600
Okay.

7856
10:04:12,120 --> 10:04:17,220
I didn't want to drop down, but if they're all going to drop down, I guess we're going to drop down.

7857
10:04:21,340 --> 10:04:22,300
Oh, Jesus.

7858
10:04:24,980 --> 10:04:26,620
I hope you're healing the other tank, then.

7859
10:04:27,280 --> 10:04:29,080

Alright.

10:05:06,630 --> 10:05:07,130

There you go.

7864
10:05:13,810 --> 10:05:14,090
Hello.

7865
10:05:14,390 --> 10:05:16,030
I swapped just in case.

7866
10:05:16,550 --> 10:05:17,710
But like, I think I should swap.

7867
10:05:17,910 --> 10:05:18,070
Whoops.

7868
10:05:18,170 --> 10:05:18,710
It's too late.

7869
10:05:19,070 --> 10:05:19,570
It's too late.

7870
10:05:19,630 --> 10:05:20,770
We're committed now.

7871
10:05:21,710 --> 10:05:22,730
It's too late.

7872
10:05:24,850 --> 10:05:25,630
It's too late.

7873
10:05:25,690 --> 10:05:27,050
We're in it for the long haul.

7874
10:05:27,610 --> 10:05:30,970
There's a Jeff exploit where you can stay, like, up top forever.

7875
10:05:31,990 --> 10:05:32,390
Okay.

7876
10:05:33,370 --> 10:05:34,350
It's too late.

7877
10:05:34,570 --> 10:05:35,370
We're here now.

7878
10:05:35,710 --> 10:05:36,730
This is where we live.

7879
10:05:38,810 --> 10:05:40,150
It's considered an exploit.

7880
10:05:40,450 --> 10:05:41,370
It's not like an actual...

7881
10:05:42,870 --> 10:05:45,050
Like, it's actually considered an exploit.

7882
10:05:51,970 --> 10:05:53,170
Bro, how...

7883
10:05:53,170 --> 10:05:56,010

10:06:06,230 --> 10:06:07,450
Okay, I might as well.

7887
10:06:07,570 --> 10:06:08,910
I'm gonna go die on this point.

7888
10:06:09,090 --> 10:06:12,910

7889
10:06:21,920 --> 10:06:35,830

10:07:08,400 --> 10:07:11,280
We're all like, goodbye, good luck, Luna.

7895
10:07:11,980 --> 10:07:12,940
We don't sit here.

7896
10:07:13,300 --> 10:07:15,460
We didn't even try and, like, push up.

7897
10:07:15,560 --> 10:07:16,920
We don't just sit there.

7898
10:07:19,980 --> 10:07:21,540
I'm going to let Luna heal.

7899
10:07:22,360 --> 10:07:23,540
Oh, never mind.

7900
10:07:23,680 --> 10:07:25,680

Nice.

7904
10:07:41,960 --> 10:07:44,320
I'll let Luna heal now.

7905
10:07:45,000 --> 10:07:45,640
This is what I mean.

7906
10:07:45,780 --> 10:07:47,600
I'm conscious about my Luna.

7907
10:07:48,280 --> 10:07:48,880
Shark Rathai?

7908
10:07:50,160 --> 10:07:50,800
I'll give him.

7909
10:07:51,980 --> 10:07:52,740
Okay.

7910
10:07:53,300 --> 10:07:54,360
What are you doing?

7911
10:07:55,080 --> 10:07:55,460
Hello?

7912
10:07:56,100 --> 10:07:57,500
You don't have your ult.

7913
10:07:57,880 --> 10:08:00,260
I'm trying to let you build your ult right now.

7914
10:08:02,200 --> 10:08:03,840
Okay, now she should have her ult so I can heal now.

7915
10:08:04,600 --> 10:08:06,120
I know she's gonna build it here.

7916
10:08:15,010 --> 10:08:15,450
Okay.

7917
10:08:15,590 --> 10:08:16,290
They can't hold a vault.

7918
10:08:16,770 --> 10:08:17,170
Okay.

7919
10:08:18,530 --> 10:08:20,650
Um, this is a lot of us.

7920
10:08:24,800 --> 10:08:25,680
I'm dead.

7921
10:08:28,620 --> 10:08:29,860
That was a lot.

7922
10:08:29,880 --> 10:08:30,940
I'll just say it.

7923
10:08:31,260 --> 10:08:33,140
That was a lot of ults.

7924
10:08:33,620 --> 10:08:36,140
Oh my god, go Luna, go skate fast.

7925
10:08:36,560 --> 10:08:39,280
Okay, but our other guy is so fucking...

7926
10:08:39,280 --> 10:08:40,360
Should I keep your walk when I get up?

7927
10:08:42,000 --> 10:08:43,020
I think we can walk.

7928
10:08:43,300 --> 10:08:43,960
I think we should walk.

7929
10:08:44,400 --> 10:08:45,060
Yeah, we'll walk.

7930
10:08:47,120 --> 10:08:49,140
Oh no, that's bad.

7931
10:08:52,080 --> 10:08:55,300
That was like so many fucking alts, so that's crazy.

7932
10:08:55,480 --> 10:08:57,300
These guys really hate it.

7933
10:08:57,540 --> 10:08:59,480
But let me build up, let me build up, let me build up.

7934
10:08:59,980 --> 10:09:00,560
Come on.

7935
10:09:00,800 --> 10:09:01,660
I'm almost there.

7936
10:09:02,420 --> 10:09:03,140
Come on, almost there.

7937
10:09:03,160 --> 10:09:04,340
I have it.

7938
10:09:04,340 --> 10:09:05,160
I have it.

7939
10:09:09,700 --> 10:09:10,540
Oh my god.

7940
10:09:11,680 --> 10:09:12,220
Please, please.

7941
10:09:12,880 --> 10:09:16,220
Can I feed me just a little bit?

7942
10:09:16,520 --> 10:09:17,000
Can I?

7943
10:09:17,480 --> 10:09:17,800
Hey.

7944
10:09:19,160 --> 10:09:19,200
Hello.

7945
10:09:19,660 --> 10:09:20,060
Thank you.

7946
10:09:20,220 --> 10:09:20,620
Thank you.

7947
10:09:20,780 --> 10:09:21,900
I'm feeding you.

7948
10:09:22,360 --> 10:09:24,820
I'm feeding you so much.

7949
10:09:25,960 --> 10:09:26,940
Oh, me first.

7950
10:09:27,380 --> 10:09:27,420
Oh, me first.

7951
10:09:28,900 --> 10:09:29,760
I have me first.

7952
10:09:30,700 --> 10:09:31,880
I'll see if I can dunk those.

7953
10:09:32,220 --> 10:09:32,780
Oh, no.

7954
10:09:34,160 --> 10:09:35,360
Maybe I'll save it for Luna.

7955
10:09:35,840 --> 10:09:36,660
I don't know.

7956
10:09:36,720 --> 10:09:38,400
They should have Wolf, or Shrain's up again.

7957
10:09:39,220 --> 10:09:40,900
Yeah, yeah, he's walking, I can tell.

7958
10:09:44,020 --> 10:09:44,640
Oh Maya.

7959
10:09:50,090 --> 10:09:50,550
Nice.

7960
10:09:53,610 --> 10:09:54,690
Oh, I got caught.

7961
10:09:58,490 --> 10:09:58,950
Nice.

7962
10:09:59,750 --> 10:10:02,410
I am ready to put on a show.

7963
10:10:03,710 --> 10:10:04,430
We're gonna have him.

7964
10:10:10,680 --> 10:10:11,920
I'm almost back.

7965
10:10:12,160 --> 10:10:13,580
No!

7966
10:10:15,680 --> 10:10:16,220
No!

7967
10:10:17,020 --> 10:10:17,200
No!

7968
10:10:17,200 --> 10:10:18,060
He's strange!

7969
10:10:18,380 --> 10:10:19,700
I'll take me that whore!

7970
10:10:21,960 --> 10:10:22,920
That whore!

7971
10:10:26,980 --> 10:10:28,860
Oh my god.

7972
10:10:30,780 --> 10:10:31,120
Goodbye.

7973
10:10:32,220 --> 10:10:32,600
Goodbye.

7974
10:10:33,260 --> 10:10:34,320
Oh, leave me.

7975
10:10:35,000 --> 10:10:36,940
The Wombo combo!

7976
10:10:38,840 --> 10:10:47,480
The thing is, if I push the strange away, If I push the strange away, I would still get hit.

7977
10:10:50,620 --> 10:10:52,520
I still can't do jack shit about it.

7978
10:10:53,480 --> 10:10:54,000
Because...

7979
10:10:54,000 --> 10:10:54,560
What about me?

7980
10:10:54,900 --> 10:10:55,420
Um...

7981
10:10:55,420 --> 10:10:56,080
Oh my.

7982
10:10:56,920 --> 10:10:57,800
Upper strange.

7983
10:10:58,020 --> 10:11:00,500
I still can't do anything about it because the fucking...

7984
10:11:00,500 --> 10:11:02,860
He was just gonna fucking slam dunk me anyway.

7985
10:11:03,380 --> 10:11:07,560
Because I have to get out of Envis to get slam dunked.

7986
10:11:08,520 --> 10:11:09,380
Both behind us now.

7987
10:11:10,000 --> 10:11:10,900
Yeah, he has a...

7988
10:11:12,160 --> 10:11:13,160
He has a...

7989
10:11:13,740 --> 10:11:14,400
He's way...

7990
10:11:14,400 --> 10:11:15,140
Oh my god, I don't like...

7991
10:11:15,140 --> 10:11:16,480
I don't want to stand near him.

7992
10:11:19,680 --> 10:11:20,920
That's the worst part.

7993
10:11:22,040 --> 10:11:24,700
I think we should die on cart, shouldn't we?

7994
10:11:25,620 --> 10:11:26,800
Oh, we should have died on cart.

7995
10:11:27,100 --> 10:11:28,720
We should not have just backed up.

7996
10:11:28,780 --> 10:11:30,460
This is like scary now.

7997
10:11:33,540 --> 10:11:34,020
Oh.

7998
10:11:39,290 --> 10:11:39,770
Oh.

7999
10:11:39,770 --> 10:11:40,210
Oh.

8000
10:11:41,870 --> 10:11:43,490
What happened to ulting the...

8001
10:11:43,490 --> 10:11:44,190
What happened?

8002
10:11:44,290 --> 10:11:45,510
What happened to Ulti?

8003
10:11:45,690 --> 10:11:46,650
Oh my god.

8004
10:11:54,050 --> 10:11:55,250
She didn't.

8005
10:11:55,790 --> 10:11:56,910
Do that one thing.

8006
10:11:57,410 --> 10:11:58,330
He didn't.

8007
10:11:58,430 --> 10:11:59,130
I knew it.

8008
10:11:59,510 --> 10:12:01,310
You know what happened?

8009
10:12:01,570 --> 10:12:03,330
Three, two, three.

8010
10:12:05,990 --> 10:12:07,630
Time to switch things up.

8011
10:12:07,810 --> 10:12:09,570
Including which side you're on.

8012
10:12:10,450 --> 10:12:12,450
I was like, why did we all back up?

8013
10:12:12,490 --> 10:12:13,430
Just die on point.

8014
10:12:14,650 --> 10:12:17,050
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

8015
10:12:17,150 --> 10:12:17,810
That's unlucky.

8016
10:12:19,490 --> 10:12:20,730
That's so unlucky.

8017
10:12:22,510 --> 10:12:24,030
Yeah, the last two push.

8018
10:12:24,370 --> 10:12:26,750
The last two push was so many mistakes.

8019
10:12:32,630 --> 10:12:33,970
Yeah, I was so confused.

8020
10:12:34,650 --> 10:12:35,890
Why did we do that?

8021
10:12:37,310 --> 10:12:39,190
We could have, like...

8022
10:12:39,190 --> 10:12:40,570
Oh, we got random...

8023
10:12:40,570 --> 10:12:42,790
Like, she held her alt for no reason.

8024
10:12:43,450 --> 10:12:45,990
She could have used that alt to save...

8025
10:12:45,990 --> 10:12:47,250
I'm just gonna need the wolf permapane.

8026
10:12:47,350 --> 10:12:47,750
The...

8027
10:12:47,970 --> 10:12:53,430
They could have used that ult to save us from getting picked.

8028
10:12:54,270 --> 10:12:57,850
Because they were greedy and was like, I'll use my ult for Wove.

8029
10:12:59,750 --> 10:13:01,030
I'll use my ult for Wove.

8030
10:13:01,310 --> 10:13:02,050
We still died.

8031
10:13:02,530 --> 10:13:05,370
They used the ult for Wove, but two of us still died.

8032
10:13:08,190 --> 10:13:09,250
Because I could have built up.

8033
10:13:09,830 --> 10:13:10,670
That's the thing.

8034
10:13:11,130 --> 10:13:12,050
Make sure you could have done that.

8035
10:13:12,130 --> 10:13:13,810
And then I could have built my ult for Wove.

8036
10:13:16,650 --> 10:13:17,390
That's the thing.

8037
10:13:17,970 --> 10:13:50,210
why I felt like I felt like it was just really dumb that we held that just either we die on card and then we regroup together because like they were just free-firing us we should have just died on card together then there's no I have to use this I told you guys it's triple support I I had a feeling I had I had a feeling I was like it's triple support it's always There you go.

8038
10:13:50,850 --> 10:13:52,310
At least I saved him.

8039
10:13:52,330 --> 10:13:53,950
He just can't jump when he's supposed to.

8040
10:13:57,310 --> 10:13:57,570
Oh.

8041
10:14:03,970 --> 10:14:05,530
Oh my god.

8042
10:14:08,410 --> 10:14:08,570
Okay.

8043
10:14:10,510 --> 10:14:11,490
Oh no.

8044
10:14:18,390 --> 10:14:18,850
Wait.

8045
10:14:22,550 --> 10:14:24,430
I don't even know who he took.

8046
10:14:24,870 --> 10:14:28,230
I don't know if I'll get it.

8047
10:14:29,470 --> 10:14:32,250
You're gonna have to let me build all of you want me to get it.

8048
10:14:36,330 --> 10:14:38,530
Because I don't know if I'm gonna get it, guys.

8049
10:14:43,170 --> 10:14:44,050
We'll find us.

8050
10:14:44,090 --> 10:14:45,290
He's gonna hold everything.

8051
10:14:50,530 --> 10:14:51,290
Okay, I got it.

8052
10:14:51,310 --> 10:14:51,670
I got it.

8053
10:14:54,090 --> 10:14:54,850
How's this?

8054
10:15:03,080 --> 10:15:04,640
Oh, my god, again.

8055
10:15:07,540 --> 10:15:07,980
Again!

8056
10:15:12,700 --> 10:15:13,140
Alright.

8057
10:15:14,360 --> 10:15:16,600
Let's hope I don't die.

8058
10:15:27,780 --> 10:15:29,060
All right.

8059
10:15:33,920 --> 10:15:37,320
All right, let's hope you actually get it.

8060
10:15:43,930 --> 10:15:44,630
That's unlucky.

8061
10:15:44,850 --> 10:15:46,270
I'm ready to put on a show.

8062
10:15:46,270 --> 10:15:51,350
I can't believe we

8063
10:15:56,170 --> 10:16:10,410
Oh, we got out of point That's unlucky Time to switch things up That's unlucky It's fine, the Wolverine Fuck you was gonna kill me

dodged that sharky.

8066
10:16:54,350 --> 10:16:55,350
He thought I was there.

8067
10:16:55,490 --> 10:16:56,310
Did you see that?

8068
10:16:57,410 --> 10:16:59,110
He would try to eat me.

8069
10:17:00,810 --> 10:17:03,330
And then we all split up for some fucking reason.

8070
10:17:05,670 --> 10:17:06,430
That was bad.

8071
10:17:07,110 --> 10:17:08,470
That was bad that we all split up there.

8072
10:17:10,430 --> 10:17:10,730
Oh.

8073
10:17:11,410 --> 10:17:12,610
It's gonna be hard.

8074
10:17:15,970 --> 10:17:17,550
Try not to be too nervous.

8075
10:17:18,770 --> 10:17:20,090
The battle starts in five.

8076
10:17:20,690 --> 10:17:23,950
Four, three, One!

8077
10:17:25,810 --> 10:17:26,290
Here they come!

8078
10:17:26,310 --> 10:17:27,210
There's some room.

8079
10:17:27,370 --> 10:17:28,470
Oh, it's fine.

8080
10:17:28,710 --> 10:17:29,490
Oh, thank you.

8081
10:17:29,630 --> 10:17:31,050
Only 60 seconds left.

8082
10:17:31,230 --> 10:17:31,890
We always do.

8083
10:17:33,190 --> 10:17:33,630
We'll go top.

8084
10:17:35,850 --> 10:17:39,890
I have to drop them dropping in too.

8085
10:17:55,470 --> 10:17:56,590
Jesus Christ.

8086
10:17:56,690 --> 10:17:59,950
I'm trying not to give...

8087
10:18:03,260 --> 10:18:04,320
Back, back, back, back, back, back.

8088
10:18:04,480 --> 10:18:04,520
Back, back, back.

8089
10:18:09,170 --> 10:18:10,250
Okay, I have it.

8090
10:18:16,420 --> 10:18:16,900
Oh my.

8091
10:18:17,680 --> 10:18:19,280
I'm just gonna play it on point.

8092
10:18:20,320 --> 10:18:21,360
Because I wanna...

8093
10:18:21,360 --> 10:18:21,900
That's fine.

8094
10:18:22,440 --> 10:18:23,120
I got...

8095
10:18:23,120 --> 10:18:23,960
I stalled it.

8096
10:18:24,560 --> 10:18:26,880
I wanted to stall it as much as I can.

8097
10:18:30,900 --> 10:18:32,720
Also did not think he got three.

8098
10:18:32,740 --> 10:18:34,840
I did not realize he got three.

8099
10:18:34,900 --> 10:18:36,020
No, he wasn't targeting me.

8100
10:18:36,480 --> 10:18:39,640
He got three people and I didn't even realize he did that.

8101
10:18:44,160 --> 10:18:45,680
They have

8102
10:18:51,770 --> 10:19:01,090
Wait, we lost Oh no, we don't have anything now We are committing so much Yeah, we committed so much

8103
10:19:05,610 --> 10:19:08,630
I want to go rocket here

8104
10:19:11,830 --> 10:19:13,890
Do I go rocket?

8105
10:19:14,390 --> 10:19:27,310
taking you spawn in jpn we gotta find your meme when this jet holds so that i can page you guys out go behind us go behind us

8106
10:19:32,370 --> 10:19:36,490
what why why did

8107
10:19:43,040 --> 10:19:56,880
you fade why did you fade why didn't you fade what did you do with emma and starlord i think we're just like completely wasted on nothing why did you

8108
10:19:59,940 --> 10:20:03,120
I just saw him take that

8109
10:20:06,820 --> 10:20:35,600
bro he's like don't worry I'll fade and he just stared at the mask that that was that was my LG though I said no matter what happens this was my LG I know that was such a sad ending though I know it was it was a sad ending but we have to call it there yeah but what if he lied

8110
10:20:38,900 --> 10:20:57,780
I don't know it'll be better I don't know if the next game will be better chat there's no we don't know that fine I won't end on the loss if I do rank I do rank chat doesn't want me to end on a loss Okay, we go again.

8111
10:21:01,340 --> 10:21:02,420
Alright, fine.

8112
10:21:03,740 --> 10:21:05,320
Because it was very disappointing.

8113
10:21:05,480 --> 10:21:06,220
I knew it.

8114
10:21:06,280 --> 10:21:07,360
I knew it, too.

8115
10:21:10,780 --> 10:21:12,640
I fucking knew it.

8116
10:21:13,460 --> 10:21:16,220
I knew that game was going to be a loss.

8117
10:21:16,360 --> 10:21:18,550
Because they went triple support and we did it.

8118
10:21:21,960 --> 10:21:22,880
Needs a sec.

8119
10:21:25,400 --> 10:21:27,040
Maybe none of us said that.

8120
10:21:27,040 --> 10:21:28,760
I can scroll up.

8121
10:21:30,320 --> 10:21:32,080
Don't end on a bad one.

8122
10:21:32,400 --> 10:21:34,100
That was a rough end.

8123
10:21:35,620 --> 10:21:36,400
One more?

8124
10:21:37,300 --> 10:21:38,960
You got one more in you.

8125
10:21:39,520 --> 10:21:40,040
Come on.

8126
10:21:40,340 --> 10:21:41,820
Don't end on a loss.

8127
10:21:42,400 --> 10:21:46,100
But what if Nana queued up till we win?

8128
10:21:46,920 --> 10:21:49,260
There's only one way to find it.

8129
10:21:50,400 --> 10:21:52,720
What do you stop selective reading?

8130
10:21:53,200 --> 10:22:01,620
I literally, I just, it's like one out of, of three, I would see that you're getting not the one guy.

8131
10:22:04,500 --> 10:22:05,740
She is lame.

8132
10:22:06,080 --> 10:22:07,380
This is a group effort.

8133
10:22:08,860 --> 10:22:10,820
You are a collective, okay?

8134
10:22:11,280 --> 10:22:14,860
If one dragoon told me that it wasn't one, okay?

8135
10:22:15,140 --> 10:22:18,500
They are representative of you.

8136
10:22:20,520 --> 10:22:21,280
That's fine.

8137
10:22:21,480 --> 10:22:22,540
I don't mind playing one more.

8138
10:22:22,960 --> 10:22:23,980
That made me angry.

8139
10:22:24,240 --> 10:22:25,380
I knew it too.

8140
10:22:26,100 --> 10:22:27,820
We literally just needed.

8141
10:22:30,060 --> 10:22:31,700
I'm thinking should I have?

8142
10:22:32,160 --> 10:22:36,460
I'm thinking like oh what if I kept my invisible alt there?

8143
10:22:37,280 --> 10:22:40,720
But like how was I supposed to know he got three of us?

8144
10:22:41,280 --> 10:22:41,620
You know?

8145
10:22:42,900 --> 10:22:49,580
I didn't realize he got three of us so I'm like oh maybe if I kept my invisible alt there maybe we could have won.

8146
10:22:50,100 --> 10:22:52,840
But then I'm like thinking like it's still a maybe.

8147
10:22:53,120 --> 10:22:54,740
It was just a lot of mistakes.

8148
10:22:59,820 --> 10:23:37,720
Because I wanted to I used it there To stall the point So we could I used it there So we could stall the point And touch the cart That's the only reason why I did it And I think I think we almost couldn't touch the cart So maybe I did do the right thing Because My team was able to touch the cart After that but we did lost the invisible from it it just sucked the last two the last two like we like we got snowballed during the last half

8149
10:23:40,880 --> 10:23:46,980
which is unfortunate but it is what it is it is what it is

8150
10:24:01,900 --> 10:24:08,280
I'm just waiting for Riggs to queue us up you know what we have to do while we wait

8151
10:24:16,290 --> 10:24:17,350
I don't want to beat.

8152
10:24:17,950 --> 10:24:20,390
I don't even know what emotes I have on my characters.

8153
10:24:20,530 --> 10:24:21,350
Oh, there it is.

8154
10:24:21,450 --> 10:24:22,290
Oh, no, I don't know.

8155
10:24:23,330 --> 10:24:24,970
I don't know what emotes I have.

8156
10:24:29,680 --> 10:24:30,400
Good time.

8157
10:24:32,640 --> 10:24:36,260

You can tell he's a boob man.

8185
10:27:31,760 --> 10:27:33,340

He goon.

8189
10:27:45,260 --> 10:27:47,440
Bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom.

8190
10:27:53,110 --> 10:27:54,570
I'm not the type who fades.

8191
10:27:55,630 --> 10:27:56,150
Okay.

8192
10:27:57,510 --> 10:27:58,470
Less bad.

8193
10:28:02,850 --> 10:28:04,670
I was like, oh.

8194
10:28:05,350 --> 10:28:07,050
But now it's less bad.

8195
10:28:09,990 --> 10:28:13,490
It wasn't very good when I first loaded it in.

8196
10:28:24,420 --> 10:28:25,500
Alright, here we go.

8197
10:28:26,620 --> 10:28:28,100
Cannon, honestly.

8198
10:28:28,360 --> 10:28:30,040
Oh man, I'm actually really running on three of them.

8199
10:28:30,140 --> 10:28:31,620
Okay, whatever happens to this game, I'm out.

8200
10:28:31,820 --> 10:28:32,600
I'm actually out.

8201
10:28:36,180 --> 10:28:37,700
I'm out, out, chat.

8202
10:28:39,060 --> 10:28:39,900
LG, for real.

8203
10:28:45,890 --> 10:28:47,530
This is real LG.

8204
10:28:49,450 --> 10:28:50,210
No more fake...

8205
10:28:50,210 --> 10:28:50,810
That's not...

8206
10:28:50,810 --> 10:28:51,790
No more fake LG.

8207
10:28:52,590 --> 10:28:53,910
Also, like, I'm most likely...

8208
10:28:53,910 --> 10:28:56,170
I just end stream and then I disappear.

8209
10:28:56,790 --> 10:28:57,390
No rain.

8210
10:28:58,270 --> 10:29:00,850
Because I'm too tired to figure out who to rain.

8211
10:29:01,050 --> 10:29:01,870
I'll just...

8212
10:29:01,870 --> 10:29:03,110
I'll be like, disappear!

8213
10:29:05,950 --> 10:29:06,470
Disperse!

8214
10:29:08,410 --> 10:29:09,610
Find your...

8215
10:29:10,010 --> 10:29:10,190
What?

8216
10:29:11,430 --> 10:29:12,190
Why did he play it?

8217
10:29:13,070 --> 10:29:13,070
Oh.

8218
10:29:15,590 --> 10:29:18,250
Find the one you want to watch next.

8219
10:29:23,790 --> 10:29:25,210
Oh, Snuffy's streaming?

8220
10:29:26,890 --> 10:29:28,110
Alright, Snuffy.

8221
10:29:28,630 --> 10:29:30,010
Is she still streaming after?

8222
10:29:44,710 --> 10:29:45,910
I'm ready.

8223
10:29:48,890 --> 10:29:49,530
I'm ready.

8224
10:29:50,770 --> 10:29:51,850
I'm ready.

8225
10:29:55,770 --> 10:29:56,650
Alright, here we go.

8226
10:29:57,930 --> 10:29:58,650
Alright.

8227
10:29:59,430 --> 10:30:01,650
This is a...

8228
10:30:01,650 --> 10:30:01,990
Okay.

8229
10:30:02,930 --> 10:30:04,330
Okay, this cop.

8230
10:30:05,190 --> 10:30:07,250
Alright, whatever happens happens.

8231
10:30:07,430 --> 10:30:08,790
I'm actually running on fumes.

8232
10:30:09,130 --> 10:30:10,930
So whatever happens happens.

8233
10:30:12,670 --> 10:30:14,070
It is what it is.

8234
10:30:15,110 --> 10:30:16,330
Now I'm ready.

8235
10:30:18,890 --> 10:30:19,170
raid.

8236
10:30:19,170 --> 10:30:20,650
I'm going to raid Snuffy after.

8237
10:30:22,690 --> 10:30:25,650
No, this cop absolutely looks fucking terrible, but that's okay.

8238
10:30:27,910 --> 10:30:28,350
That's okay.

8239
10:30:28,470 --> 10:30:30,930
That means Rigsby is not closer to top 500, too.

8240
10:30:31,510 --> 10:30:32,850
Because I'm pretty sure he deranged.

8241
10:30:35,810 --> 10:30:41,890
I swear that, God, if I see a...

8242
10:30:41,890 --> 10:31:06,530
If I see triple support, I swear that I'm going to be very angry daddy's angry oh man this sucks i for those who don't know um this map is fucking terrible because it's so laggy

8243
10:31:11,200 --> 10:31:17,000

10:31:28,050 --> 10:31:29,450
What happened to my team?

8246
10:31:29,670 --> 10:31:29,790
Okay.

8247
10:31:33,250 --> 10:31:33,770

Okay.

8252
10:31:43,250 --> 10:31:43,570
That's okay.

8253
10:31:44,150 --> 10:31:46,950
We don't have, they have still have support outs, but that's it.

8254
10:31:49,930 --> 10:31:50,550
All right.

8255
10:31:50,630 --> 10:31:51,110

10:32:31,610 --> 10:32:33,090
There was nothing.

8263
10:32:33,250 --> 10:32:34,390
Oh, the map's moving.

8264
10:32:34,570 --> 10:32:36,550
My body is being transported.

8265
10:32:37,010 --> 10:32:38,170
Oh, they wasted that.

8266
10:32:39,490 --> 10:32:40,330
That's good.

8267
10:32:40,670 --> 10:32:42,650
Oh, no, it's because we used Scylla.

8268
10:32:43,190 --> 10:32:44,710
I mean, it's still a waste.

8269
10:32:48,980 --> 10:32:50,000
I think it's...

8270
10:32:50,000 --> 10:32:50,280
No.

8271
10:32:55,910 --> 10:32:59,150
God, yeah, but this map is known to cost huge $4.

8272
10:32:59,170 --> 10:33:00,130
Rain drops.

8273
10:33:01,590 --> 10:33:02,230
That's...

8274
10:33:02,230 --> 10:33:02,890
What?

8275
10:33:03,530 --> 10:33:04,710
Oh, did he get...

8276
10:33:04,710 --> 10:33:05,730
Oh, that's unlucky.

8277
10:33:08,390 --> 10:33:08,770
Oh.

8278
10:33:11,930 --> 10:33:12,930
That's unlucky.

8279
10:33:14,910 --> 10:33:17,490
He didn't say anything that crazy.

8280
10:33:17,830 --> 10:33:21,310
And then literally, so it was like, has he said he's theirs yet?

8281
10:33:23,010 --> 10:33:24,490
Can we stop staggering, please?

8282
10:33:25,410 --> 10:33:26,050
My fault, my fault.

8283
10:33:29,170 --> 10:33:30,190
That's crazy.

8284
10:33:31,090 --> 10:33:34,930
Guys, I think he has said something crazy.

8285
10:33:36,030 --> 10:33:37,410
He's in it.

8286
10:33:40,470 --> 10:33:40,790
Okay.

8287
10:33:49,570 --> 10:33:50,370
Bro,

8288
10:33:55,250 --> 10:33:57,150
bro, there's no way.

8289
10:33:58,070 --> 10:33:59,310
Like, how do you...

8290
10:33:59,310 --> 10:34:00,650
Oh, my God.

8291
10:34:02,770 --> 10:34:12,450
god okay okay that's unlucky that's very unlucky i think it's also because he's oh my god okay

8292
10:34:15,790 --> 10:34:29,490
that oh we just don't have baba for it i think all right this is actually lg though even we don't win this i'm too tired to keep going i'm mad Like,

8293
10:34:33,980 --> 10:34:34,440
we're running.

8294
10:34:36,920 --> 10:34:39,900
This is a weird-ass duo, too.

8295
10:34:43,910 --> 10:34:47,750
This is a weird-ass duo because we are running.

8296
10:34:49,190 --> 10:34:54,910
They're duoed as, like, Groot and an Iron Fist, yo.

8297
10:34:55,490 --> 10:34:55,870
Oh, I.

8298
10:34:56,030 --> 10:34:57,210
TPS time for me.

8299
10:34:59,370 --> 10:35:01,050
TPS time for me.

8300
10:35:05,500 --> 10:35:37,000
no maybe no silk song i don't think i can i don't think i can make it i don't think so family still comes i think it's over for me i really do guys i don't think i'm fixing my sleep schedule i really don't okay i think i just end up streaming where rivals i was trying to fix my sleep schedule also like it's been fun Oh no,

8301
10:35:37,080 --> 10:35:40,120
I said that this week will be like no schedule week.

8302
10:35:42,280 --> 10:35:44,880
Because I did get last minute invited to a business trip.

8303
10:35:45,480 --> 10:35:52,940
So like it would be awkward putting out schedule because I'd be gone at the end of the week till Wednesday.

8304
10:36:01,500 --> 10:36:02,360
Persia's day?

8305
10:36:02,740 --> 10:36:03,940
I like how we still don't have time.

8306
10:36:03,940 --> 10:36:35,260
triple support which is very scary or like you know a mag it would be nice to have a mag you know that would be pretty cool just a little bit I guess I guess not that cool now that I think about it okay I'm sorry you were not gonna live Like, there was no way.

8307
10:36:37,580 --> 10:36:38,440
There was no way.

8308
10:36:40,560 --> 10:36:41,780
It's just unlucky.

8309
10:36:42,020 --> 10:36:43,280
We just got...

8310
10:36:43,280 --> 10:36:44,780
We get like...

8311
10:36:44,780 --> 10:36:46,780
We got all the players...

8312
10:36:47,500 --> 10:36:48,320
Like, this is...

8313
10:36:48,320 --> 10:36:50,760
See, E-O-M-M-Giveth and E-O-M-T-E-Theth.

8314
10:36:51,020 --> 10:36:51,780
We got...

8315
10:36:52,400 --> 10:36:54,180
We got all the players...

8316
10:36:54,180 --> 10:36:55,140
Oh my gosh, I should have stopped.

8317
10:36:55,300 --> 10:36:55,980
I should...

8318
10:36:55,980 --> 10:36:57,540
I should have stopped really.

8319
10:36:57,880 --> 10:37:01,140
All the players that play the most niche characters...

8320
10:37:01,140 --> 10:37:03,160
Combined into one team.

8321
10:37:03,780 --> 10:37:29,880
Like we have a group player and then the iron fist is dueled with a group one trick And then we have the spider-man player So it's like there's no winning We literally we have the all the niche players to get it So there's there's oh my god Oh my god The fucking thing changed

8322
10:37:34,220 --> 10:37:41,040
Like, I was trying, the fucking, the map changed so I couldn't jump to the high ground.

8323
10:37:41,840 --> 10:37:42,760
That was so fucked.

8324
10:37:43,880 --> 10:37:45,320
That was actually so fucked.

8325
10:37:45,820 --> 10:37:48,360
I was trying to jump to that high ground area.

8326
10:37:50,700 --> 10:37:54,740
No, this is, it's actually the most unlucky.

8327
10:37:59,340 --> 10:38:01,520
It give if and it take it.

8328
10:38:01,540 --> 10:38:21,420
guys all right I gamba too hard it's like I got the 666 you know I got the 666 guys I

8329
10:38:28,450 --> 10:38:32,630
don't think I'm building this up Victories are worth celebrating.

8330
10:38:35,810 --> 10:38:35,870
Hey.

8331
10:38:36,430 --> 10:38:37,430
Ha, miss.

8332
10:38:37,690 --> 10:38:38,830
Ha, you're so bad.

8333
10:38:40,130 --> 10:38:40,630
Oh, shit.

8334
10:38:40,770 --> 10:38:41,170
He was not.

8335
10:38:41,390 --> 10:38:42,010
Oh, my God.

8336
10:38:42,110 --> 10:38:42,930
He was farming our Groot.

8337
10:38:43,110 --> 10:38:43,990
He was not missing.

8338
10:38:51,800 --> 10:38:52,560
Oh, my God.

8339
10:38:52,720 --> 10:38:54,400
Guys, he wasn't missing, guys.

8340
10:38:54,580 --> 10:38:55,440
He was just...

8341
10:39:02,280 --> 10:39:03,100
Hey, guys.

8342
10:39:03,560 --> 10:39:03,960
Cool.

8343
10:39:06,580 --> 10:39:09,480
Like, I don't know what we could do to fix that.

8344
10:39:09,600 --> 10:39:10,440
Like, I...

8345
10:39:10,440 --> 10:39:13,340
Do you know what would a triple support?

8346
10:39:16,520 --> 10:39:18,980
Oh my god, you play strange.

8347
10:39:19,660 --> 10:39:21,660
Why do you do this to yourself?

8348
10:39:27,280 --> 10:39:37,380
You're trying to tell me that you actually play other characters, but oh my god But you just chose not to

8349
10:39:49,270 --> 10:40:43,570
like that's crazy i literally told you to avoid serbian serbian freak down you you get bro and this guy no bro i mean like one trick's gotta stick together you know like maybe okay i'm it's fine i'm i'm i did get my seventh win from this but I need a stop I know I'm gonna get so tight I need a stop I I got see him swapped it strange willingly made me realize that he had a choice and he decided not to that's that's crazy this guy

8350
10:40:47,780 --> 10:40:51,780
Oh my god, he's- he's having- oh my god.

8351
10:40:57,260 --> 10:40:58,780

Okay, I- I go sleep.

8355
10:41:12,310 --> 10:41:13,510
GG's, I'm done.

8356
10:41:14,930 --> 10:41:15,790
Yeah, me too.

8357
10:41:17,770 --> 10:41:18,530
Yeah.

8358
10:41:21,770 --> 10:41:23,650
No, I'm good.

8359
10:41:24,910 --> 10:41:26,390
I think that was my sign.

8360
10:41:27,230 --> 10:41:29,510
But I still had a great time.

8361
10:41:29,930 --> 10:41:32,950
I had a great time streaming today.

8362
10:41:33,130 --> 10:41:35,170
You guys always cheer me up and everything.

8363
10:41:35,450 --> 10:41:37,370

8364
10:41:37,670 --> 10:41:37,850
Maybe.

8365
10:41:38,450 --> 10:41:39,390
Maybe not on YouTube.

8366
10:41:39,510 --> 10:41:40,150
Maybe I'll do on Twitch.

8367
10:41:40,630 --> 10:41:43,050
I'll do another grind later today on Twitch.

8368
10:41:43,590 --> 10:41:44,530
Or just not grind.

8369
10:41:44,750 --> 10:41:46,290
I think grind is not the right word.

8370
10:41:46,690 --> 10:41:49,510
I'll do another Edo Terrorism Day later today.
